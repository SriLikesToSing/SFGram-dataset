Do you have 
a restless urge 
to write? 



If you do, here is an opportunity 
for you to take the first 

Bennett Gerf, the distinguished 

important step to success in writing Stotti? FacuT y b of of 

the Famous Writers School. 




There’s something different about peo- 
ple who feel the urge to write. They have 
a spiritual hunger that sets them apart — 
even from family and friends. 

If you have known this burning need 
to write, you, too, may have the gift suc- 
cessful authors possess. 

They know that this restless urge for 
self-expression is perhaps the most im- 
portant ingredient of writing success. 
But, they realize it can waste away if 
you don’t know how to get started writ- 
ing, or if you hesitate to try. 

Several years ago a group of famous 
authors including Rod Serling, Faith 
Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, Bruce Catton, 
and several others joined forces to start 
the Famous Writers School. They poured 
everything they know about writing into 
a remarkable new kind of professional 
training course which trains you at home 
in your spare time. You begin with the 
fundamentals of all good writing. Then 
you get advanced training in the specialty 
of your choice. 

Each of your assignments is examined 
by an instructor who is a professional 
writer or editor. He goes over your work 
word by word, blue-penciling changes 
right on your manuscript. Then he re- 
turns it to you with a long letter of ad- 



vice on how to improve your writing. 

This training works well. Our students 
have sold their writing to hundreds of 
publications. 

Free Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you, too, have writing 
ability worth developing, send for the 
School’s revealing Aptitude Test. If you 
test well, or offer other evidence of writ- 
ing aptitude — you may enroll. However, 
there is no obligation to do so.

The captain is asleep. I am the '

I don’t know why they used my 
voice for the computer’s vocal out- 
put. The captain laughs about it 
—says it’s like I’m talking to my- 
self. At least they didn’t try to 
build a personality into the com- 
puter. Having four scientists 
aboard is enough personality for 
any mission. 

What’s Ling saying? 

“They are definitely biological. 
Look at the readouts yourself.” 



I NTERCOM camera view. Ling 
is sitting on the edge of his 
couch. It’s cranked up to a sitting 
position and swiyeled to his work- 
bench. He’s flashing the readout 
from one of his instruments over 
the intercom. The spectrophoto- 
meter, looks like. It shows a list 
of numbers. The recorder will read 
it off for the data file and the log.

bles. 

“Hydrocarbons mostly,” Ling 
goes on. “But notice, please, lines 
fourteen and thirty-seven — leucine 
and tyrosine. Amino acids.” 

Ling is trying to maintain his 
Chinese cool but he sounds ex- 
cited. Just for kicks, let’s check 
his medical monitor. Yes — heart 
rate is up. 

“Amino add molecules,” Brom- 
ley says flatly from his cubicle. 
“We’re in the midst of a biologi- 
cal blizzard.” 

That’s no surprise. The un- 
manned probes discovered the bi- 
ological “snow” falling from the 
top cloud deck. Sunlight and 
lightning propel biochemical reac- 
tions in the clouds — amino adds 
and other gunk predpitates out. 
It’s what happens to the stuff un- 
derneath the clouds that we’re 
supposed to investigate. 

It’s a -shame Ling’s depilitated. 
He’d look better with a stringy 
mustache. The complete Chinese 
sage. Head too big for his skinny 
body. Bromley’s just the opposite: 
soft and round. I swear he ? s bloat-

I check on Him. He can’t be gain-

The computer flashes the words 
before my eyes as well as saying

Okay, sweep the radio frequen-

nerve-sizzling interference. The

tually useless. Try the laser again.

right, end communication^ check. 
We’re cut off from the orbiting 
ships, completely shut away from 
the rest of the human race. Not 
even the starships are as lonely. 

SHIP SYSTEMS CHECK. 

The computer is flashing data 
to me. Images flicker in my eyes 
as fast as my brain can take in the 
information — propulsion system, 
electrical power, life support, 
structural integrity— numbers, bar 
charts, symbols, graphs, curves. 
Outside pressure is up to ten. at- 
mospheres. And we’ve just started. 
When do we enter the second

IN FORTY-SIX HOURS 
EIGHTEEN MINUTES, AC-

Below that deck is the ocean, 
where the pressure starts at a ton 
per square centimeter. Then we’ll 
see how good a ship we are. 

Were those sonar pictures from 
the unmanned probes really show- 
ing animals? As big as icebergs?

L UDONGO has drifted into 
Ling’s cubicle. They’re com- 
paring notes. Ludongo has fin- 
ished his atmospheric analysis, 
looks like. Ling is working on the 
biochemistry of the snowflakes. 

Bromley’s getting off his tail 
and joining them. 

Ling is saying, -“It’s amazing 
how similar the biochemistry is to 
the terrestrial pattern.” 

Bromley floats in and grabs a 
handhold. The cubicle is barely 
big enough for the three of them. 
Ludongo nods hello and drifts be- 
hind Ling’s couch to the' corner 
where the medical monitoring 
console stands. Maybe I ought to 
make them stay in their own cubi- 
cles and chat over the intercom. 
Avoid injury if we hit more turbu- 
lence. 

Check the outside infrared. 
Give me a course plot and turbu- 
lence prediction. 

NO MAJOR TURBULENCE

Okay. Let them float around 
for a while. The bulkheads are 
padded. Alert me if any sign of 
turbulence shows up. 
UNDERSTOOD. 

My God, Speer’s getting up. Is 
he finally getting a little courage 
or is he scared of being left alone? 

DISTURSANCE DETECTED 
AT MAXIMUM INFRARED

Show. me. Flickering light. 
Gone now. No, there’s another. 



Give me max magnification. It 
must be a lightning storm. Dis- 
tance? 

DATA INSUFFICIENT FOR

Hell! Looks pretty dim but in- 
frared wouldn’t pick up much of 
a lightning bolt, would it? No 
ideas at all for estimating the dis- ■ 
tance? 

COMPARISON OF VISUAL 
SIGNAL AGAINST AUDIBLE 
SIGNAL COULD GIVE AN 
APPROXIMATION OF DIS- 
TANCE 

Listen for the boom, yeah. We 
used to do that when I was a kid, 
gauge the distance to a thunder- 
storm that way. Turn on the out- 
side mikes and filter out the 
boundary layer noise. What’s the 
speed of sound out there? 

BASED ON MEASURE- 
MENTS OF ATMOSPHERIC 
PRESSURE AND COMPOSI- 
TION, SOUND SPEED IS AP- 
PROXIMATELY SIX KILO- 
METERS PER SECOND, PLUS

But I don’t hear anything. No 
boom. Shock waves must be 
damping out. What’s the damp- 
irig function for this atmosphere?

THIRTY MINUTES. 

Inside view. Speer is bobbing 
softly in the passageway just out- 
side Ling’s compartment, one 
hand on the open hatch. The 
other crewmen are jammed inside. 

Ling is saying, “If this biologi- 
cal snow is falling all across the 
planet — what happens to it in the 
second cloud layer? And in the 
ocean?’’ 

“Torn to shreds, I should imag- 
ine,” says Bromley. “Those are 
not the warm, gentle seas of Earth 
down there, you realize. They’re 
no doubt highly corrosive, laced 
with plenty of ammonia and God 
knows what else. Long-chain mol- 
ecules simply wouldn’t stand a 
chance in that ocean.” 

Ludongo looks like he* s fed up 
with Bromley’s, pompousness but 
Ling simply smiles like a cat. 

“Indeed?” Ling asks softly. 
“But what of the sonar pictures 
that the probes returned? What 
are t^ose huge objects floating in 
the ocean?” 

“Icebergs, rocks, mountains 
torn loose from the surface be- 
low — ’’ 

“So? Warmer than the ambient 
seas around them?” 

Bromley looks uncomfortable. 
“I’ll admit that there’s a good 
deal we have to learn. But one 
shouldn’t jump to conclusions. 
Whoever built those machines on 
Titan certainly did not come from 
Jupiter— or from Saturn, for that 
matter. Any fool could’ve told the 

PRESSURE VESSEL 



politicians that. It’s so obvious.” 
Ludongo’s father is a politician. 
He says, “Yes, of course. But if 
we had convinced the politicians 
there would have been no Jupiter 
mission at all.” 

“Frankly, I wouldn’t have 
minded a bit,” Bromley says. 
“This is no place for a manned 
expedition.^ Unmanned probes 
could do everything that needs to 
be done here. I volunteered for a 
star mission, not this. I accepted 
Jupiter because they needed me.” 
Ling smiles sadly. 

“We all desired star missions.” 
“And none of us qualified,” 
adds Speer. 

“I qualified for a star mission,” 
Ludongo counters. “But my fa- 
ther, the Prime Minister (he stares 
straight at Bromley), did not want 
me to go. By the time I returned 
even from Alpha CentaurL he 
would be long in his grave.” 

“Yet he permitted you to go on 
this — this — ” 

Bromley means, but does not 
say, suicide mission . 

“A Ludongo does not back 
away from a question of cour- 
age.” 

S PEER hunches his thin shoul- 
ders. “Let’s face the truth. 
We’re expendable. For this mis- - 
sion they needed good, capable 
men who woiv’i be missed too 
much if they don’t come back.” 

He made three great friends 
with that crack. We all know it’s

true but who wants to talk about 
it? The only nonexpendable mem- 
ber of this mission is the recorder. 
It listens to everything we say, 
takes down every bit of data from 
the instruments, carries my mut- 
terings for the log. They built it to 
make its way back to the orbiting 
ships all by itself, even if we break 
into pieces. 

Starting to hear rumbles from 
the lightning storm. Bolts are be- 
coming bright enough to blank 
out my eyes for a second or so. 

MODERATE TURBULENCE 
TEN MINUTES AHEAD. 

Noted — hey, there’s a blast! 
Single lightning tree zapping from 
the clouds above all the way down 
to the second deck. 

SEVERE TURBULENCE 
THIRTY SECONDS AHEAD. 

“Grab onto something quick — ” 

I put as much snap and urgency 
as I can into my words over the 
intercom. 

Turn off the outside mikes. The 
turbulence is like getting hit with 
a hammer. Stabilizer cuts in. 
Okay. 

Inside camera. 

“Everybody all right?’’ 

They’re grumbling and swear- 
ing. Nobody hurt. 

“Get back to your own couches 
and strap in. Strong turbulence 
coming up.” 

How come you only gave a 
thirty-second warning? 

ELECTRICAL STORM 
GROWING RAPIDLY. 



GROWTH PARAMETERS IN- 
SUFFICIENTLY UNDER- 
STOOD FOR DETAILED TUR- 
BULENCE PREDICTIONS. 

Thanks for admitting it — after 
the fact. Storm’s spreading and 
we’re heading right into it. Car- 
penter's not much on maneuver- 
ing — more like a dirigible than 
anything else. 

Here’s Captain Voronov. 
Chunky Russian. Used to be 
blond and jovial. Looks blond and 
worried now. HeJniCkles himself 
into the pilot’s couch and fits the 
connectors to his face and crani- 
um. 

Now there are two of us. He’s 
sharing the ship with me. He slips 
his hands and feet into the control 
connectors. We’re linked. 

. “Don’t think we can get around 
it, Andy.” 

I can sense him nodding. My 
eyes are watching the flickering 
lightning, closer than ever now. 
The computer is superimposing 
numbers over the outside view — 
storm’s extent, our course and 
speed, turbulence levels. 

“I would not care to try going 
through it,” Andrei says. His Eng- 
lish comes out slow and careful, 
in a deep baritone: This saline we 
live in makes everybody’s speech 
a bit slower 'and deeper than npr- 
mal. 

The scientists are. all battened 
down like good little boys. They’re 
watching their display screens, 
looking at the storm.

IF 




“Would ft be possible,’’ Ling 
asks softly, “to get close enough 
to the storm to observe the effect 
of the lightning on the biological 
particles?” 

“Lord, I should hope not,” says 
Bromley. 

“Too much turbulence,” An- 
drei says firmly. 

He’s checking the mission plan 
and our performance limits. I re- 
alize that he wants to go under 
the storm, through the second 
cloud deck. I run through a sys- 
tems check and start the compu- 
ter plotting an optimum course. 

“Good Robert,” Andrei says as 
the course plot flashes before our 
eyes. “The descent rate is steep 
but within tolerable limits. Exe- 
cute.” 

It is steep. My stomach doesn’t 
like it. Displays are flashing like a 
movie now — engine thrust, tem- 
peratures, hull pressures, strain, 
descent rate. 

Listen to them wail ! 

“What are we doing?” Ludongo 
calls. “Are we going down?” 

Andrei answers, “The only way 
to avoid the storm is by penetrat- 
ing the second cloud layer.” 

“But we’re not supposed to go 
down for another two days. I have 
two days of experimertts to do at 
this level.” 

Bromley: “You can’t arbitrarily 
juggle the mission plan like this, 
without consulting us first. After 
all—” 

“No time for discussion,” An- 



drei cuts in. “We go right down.” 

They’re sore. And scared. Me, 
too. Below the second cloud deck 
is the real unknown. Only a cou- 
ple probes ever got back. Those 
sonar pictures. Big as mountains. 
Warm. And alive? 

We’re really bouncing now. I 
can feel liquid gurgling in my 
ears. Outside view is blank. We’re 
in the clouds. Damned couch feels 
like it’s got rocks inside the pad- 
ding. Straps are cutting into me. 
Ship feels okay, though. Engines 
are strong. The bright boys in 
back are clammed up. Was that 
Bromley’s yell? Don’t blame him. 
Another drop like that and I’ll 
yell too. 

Starting to ease off, I think. 
Maybe we — what a jolt! Felt like 
a bomb went off inside the Ship. 

YELLOW ALERT. SUBSYS- 
TEM MALFUNCTION. GEN- 
ERATOR OUTPUT DOWN 
TEN PER CENT. 

“Check it,” Andrei says to me. 

The performance graph doesn’t 
look too bad. No real danger. 
Look into the generator bay. Ev- 
erything seems normal— wait. A 
bubble just drifted up from be- 
hind the — get a closeup. Yep, a 
leak in the coolant line. Nothing 
serious. Not yet. 

“I see it,” Andrei says, j 

The ship’s riding smoother now. 
Long, slow rolling moment, with a 
bit of a chdppy pitch still but now 
it’s more regular. Not too bad. 

“I’d better fix that coolant

leak,” I tell Andrei. 

‘‘Yes. And then take your rest 
period. We’re out of the turbu- 
lence now. I can handle it alone.” 

UNPLUG. 

II 

LUG IN. 

I didn’t sleep too well. 
Dreamed about Marlene, just like 
she was alive. 

The ship is riding along easily 
now, inside the ocean, more like a 
submarine than a dirigible. An- 
drei lolls in his couch. The scien- 
tists are happy as kids in a cave, 
with a whole new world to explore. 
Every instrument we have is going 
full bore. Visions of Nobel Prizes 
floating out there. 

Can’t see much else. Really 
black now. Even the infrared is 
useless. It’s^onar or nothing. No 
more snowflakes. Maybe they’re 
still out there but they don’t regis- 
ter on .the sonar. 

“Did you have a good sleep?” 
Andrei asks. 

“So-so. Kind of tense, excited. I 
feel more relaxed when I’m 
plugged in. Got something to do, 
somebody to talk to. It’s lonely 
back there in the cocoon. Un- 
plugged here means unconnected 
— to me at least. Nothing to do 
but think and worry.” 

Andrei says nothing. The con- 
nectors hide most of his face. All I 
can see are his mouth and chin. 
But I get the feeling that what I’ve 



said somehow has displeased him. 

Bromley braced me back there. 

I was on my way back from the 
generator bay, heading for the co- 
coon. He floated out of his own 
compartment and blocked the 
passageway. 

“Could we speak to you for a 
moment in private?” 

That’s a laugh— in private. 

“Who’s we?” I asked him. 

Bromley nodded toward Ludon- 
go’s cubby and drifted toward the 
hatch to it. I pushed a foot against 
the passageway bulkhead and fol- 
lowed him. Ludongo was sitting 
on his couch. His instruments 
were all on automatic and he 
reached over to snap off his inter- 
com screen when I hunched in. 
That was what Bromley had 
meant by private. 

“We want to talk with you,” he 
rumbled in his pressure-deepened 
bass. 

“In. strict confidence,” Bromley 
added. “If you feel that you can’t 
keep what we say confidential — ” 
He let the idea dangle. 

“I’ll listen,” I said. “If you 
start to say things^ ! can’t keep 
quiet about I’ll tell you.” 

“Fair enough,” said Ludongo. 
He looked up at Bromley, who 
was bobbing nervously in front of 
the workbench. 

“We’re worried about Captain 
Voronov,” Bromley said. 

“Worried about him?” 

Ludongo ,said, “We don’t like 
the arbitrary way he decided to

' plunge into the-ocean. That was 
not only, a dangerous decision but 
an unfair one.” 

‘‘Who’s we?” I asked again. 

‘‘We scientists, of course,” 
Bromley said. 

“All four of you?” 

“Speer feels exactly as we do. 
Ling is naturally more reticent 
about his feelings but he’s upset 
also.” 

I looked at Bromley. Inside that 
rubbery face was a bom trouble- 
maker, the kind who starts fights 
and then stands off at the side- 
lines holding the coats and watch- 
ing the blood flow. 

“He’s the captain,” I said. “He 
had to make a fast decision. There 
wasn’t any time for a conference 
or a vote.” 

Bromley countered, “There were 
a number of other things he could 
have done. He could have re- 
versed our course, or gone up 
over the storm.”: 

I shook my head. “Either al- 
ternative would have cost too 
much energy. He’s gofto consider 
the whole mission. You wouldn’t 
want to get caught down here in a 
week or so without power, would 
you?” 

“Of course not,” said Ludongo. 
“Maybe the captain made the 
best decision. We’re not arguing 
that point — merely the manner in 
which it was made. We should 
have been consulted,” 
“No.timo.fprit.” ; ( , !ci 
“Nonsense,” Bromley said ~“lt’s 



his attitude, that’s all. He’s acting 
as if this were a warship and we 
nothing but crew members under 
his command.” 

“That’s right. This is a military 
mission. That’s why military men 
are in charge.” 

“You two are in charge — ” 
Bromley shook a finger at me — 
“because you’re experienced in 
ship handling. The purpose of this 
mission is scientific. There isn’t 
the faintest military reason for this 
expedition.” 

I felt myself starting to simmer. 
“Come on now. If those buildings 
on Titan weren’t there we wouldn’t 
be here — and you know it.” 

“Yes,” , Ludongo answered, 
smiling broadly, “that’s true. But 
you don’t actually expect to find 
the builders down here, do you?” 

“You’re the scientists. You tell 
me. 

“What makes you so certain 
that those buildings present a 
military threat to man?” Bromley 
asked. 

H OW could he be, so blind? 

“Any race that can set up 
machinery that runs unattended 
for God-only-knows how many 
centuries has a technology that is 
capable of crushing us. You know 
that, too.” 

“But what makes you think 
they’d be hostile?” 

. ‘‘Why are the machines still 
running?” 

Bromley told me with a look of 



PRESSURE VESSEL

disgust, “The machines could be 
completely benign toward us. 
More likely, they’re completely 
indifferent. Their builders prob- 
ably never gave a damn about us 
One way of the other.” 

“I have my own idea,” said Lu- 
dongo. “I have been on Mars. I 
have seen the artifacts there. They 
were created by human hands, 
built to human scale for human . 
uses.” 

“Yes, I know,” Bromley mut- 
tered. 

“It is entirely possible that 
there was a human civilization be- 
fore the Ice Ages. A civilization 
that reached Mars, perhaps even 
Titan. Those buildings and the 
machinery inside them could have 
been put up by our own ances- 
tors.” 

I asked, “What happened to 
that civilization?” 

Shrugging, Ludongo answered, 
“War. Natural catastrophe.” 

“The Ice Ages could have easily 
wiped it put,” Bromley suggested. 

“On Earth,” I said. “What hap- 
pened on Mars, on the Moon? 
And why are the buildings on Ti- 
tan still standing? And what are 
the machines doing?” 

No answers. 

“Okay,” I said. “You could be 
right. Maybe there’s nothing to be 
worried about. But there’s still a 
good chance that the works on Ti- 
tan were built by another race. 
We can’t just assutne that they’re 
friendly or even neutral.” 



“They’re probably dead and 
gone by now,” Bromley said. 

“At least they’re gone,” Lu- 
dongo added. 

They still didn’t get it. “Look. 
From a military point of view, 
we’ve got to assume that those 
buildings represent a possible 
threat. We’ve got to. be ready for 
that threat. If it never material- 
izes, fine. But if it does and we’re 
not ready for it — goodbye for 
keeps.” 

“How could you possibly ex- 
. pect to be ready — ” 

“We’ve drifted away from the 
original subject,” Ludongo said 
uneasily. 

“No, we’fe exactly on the sub- 
ject,” I insisted. “This is a mili- 
tary mission. The captain’s job is 
to seek out any alien life forms we 
can find and get enough informa- 
tion about them to decide whether 
or not they might have built the 
machines on Titan.” 

“That’s arrant nonsense. No 
creatures that live in this black 
gravity pit could even realize that 
there are other worlds, let alone 
build interplanetary ships.” 

“Maybe. But we’re here to find 
out for sure. You scientists are 
supposed to provide the informa- 
tion. The captain and I are here 
to rujx the ship and see that the 
mission objectives are carried 
out.” 

Bromley’s face seemed to puff 
out even more with anger. He 
looked past me, to Ludongo.

“I told you it’d do no good to 
talk to him. Bloody fools all think 
alike. Military mission!” He 
turned on me. “You’re here to 
ferry us about and see to it that 
we’re safe and comfortable. This 
is a scientific expedition. There’s 
no military necessity behind it — 
except what you gold-braided bar- 
barians make up out of thin air.” 
“Okay, that’s enough,” I 
snapped; “You can think what- 
ever you Uke. But you’ll take or- 
ders from the captain just like any 
crewman on a military ship. Peri- 
od.” 

I didn’t wait for an answer. I 
pushed through the hatch and 
swam up the passageway to the 
flight deck: 

O N PLAYBACK the encoun- 
ter is almost funny. Brom- 
ley’s weird: He really thinks we’d 
be risking our butts in this soup 
just to give him a chance to satisfy 
his scientific curiosity. 

SONAR CONTACT. 

Six faint white blips in the mid- 
dle of the gray, grainy Sonar -dis- 
play. Nothing else is visible. Com- 
puter’s flashing data — course, cur- 
rent vector, range, closing speed. 

Andrei mumbles, “Fifty kilo- 
meters away and closing on us at 
better than fifty kilometers per 
hour.'” 

“Look at that current vector. 
Unless the computer’s blown a cir- 
cuit, they’re moving against the 
current.” 



Andrei goes to the intercom. 
“Sonar has detected six large ob- 
jects approaching us. They are 
moving upstream — against the 
prevailing current.” 

Ling is the first to answer. “Is 
this' the maximum enlargment you 
can provide?” He’s got the sonar 
display on his main screen. 

“Yessir,” I answer. “It’s on 
max. When they get into closer 
range we can switch to other sen- 
sors.” 

Ludongo, ‘‘Can the computer 
make a size estimate?” 

TWO POINT FIVE TO 
THREE POINT FIVE KILO- 
METERS, PLUS OR MINUS 
TWENTY PER CENT. 

Kilometers! Not a word from 
the scientists now. They’re all 
watching the sonar display. Ling’s 
trying to view them on infrared, 
as well. About all you can tell at 
this range is that they’re slightly 
warmer than the sea itself. 

They’ve disappeared. 

“My Screen’s gone blank.” 
“What happened?” 

“Hold on, hold on,” I yell at 
them. Check the screens. Get a 
wide-angle view. Yeah, there they 
are — look at them go! 

“They’re running away from 
us.” 

“They sure are,” I say. 

Andrei watches them' dwindle 
in the distance on the wide-angle 
sonar display. “I thought we had 
lost them entirely when they 
jumped out Of view on the close-

up. Give me a speed estimate.” 

ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY 
KILOMETERS PER HOUR, 
PLUS OR MINUS FIVE PER 
CENT. 

“I don’t believe it,” I mutter. 

CONFIRMED. 

“We certainly won’t be able to 
catch up with them,” Andrei says. 
A very ptactical thought. 

“They are alive,” Ling says, 
awed. He’s knocked the empty 
sonar display off his main screen 
and is rerunning the tape showing 
the animals. 

“Alive,” Speer echoes. “And so 
huge.” 

“Like whales,” Andrei says. 
“Jovian whales. Have any of you 
hunted whales?” 

No answers. 

“Well, I have. When I was 
much younger. Whales can be 
very intelligent beasts — extremely 
intelligent.” 

Bromley chimes in, “Do they 
build machinery, Captain?” 

“No. But they learn to run at 
the sight of danger. Those Jovian- 
whales ran away from something. 
They sensed us, probably, and 
bolted. Why should they do that?” 

I FLICK a peek at Andrei. His 
mouth is set in a tight line. 

“Are you suggesting that these 
animals are accustomed to being 
hunted?” Bromley asks. His voice 
is dripping disbelief. 

“They certainly acted as if they 
were frightened.” 

16 



“Nonsense,” Bromley snorts. 

Ludongo says, “But there’s the 
infall of biological snow from the 
clouds above. This ocean is like a 
constantly replenished biological 
soup — ” 

Bromley, “More like a biologi- 
cal vichysoisse, considering the 
temperatures out there.” 

“The point is,” Ludongo re- 
sumes, “that the whales have a, 
steady food supply. Why should 
there be predators when free food 
is plentiful?” 

I can sense Andrei shrugging. 
“Terrestrial baleen whales eqt 
plankton — also free. Yet they are 
preyed upon by orcas, sharks — 
and submarines carrying men.” 

“You’re not suggesting that 
these whales are hunted by intelli- 
gent creatures?” 

Bromley looks really upset. He 
doesn’t want to believe a word of 
what is being said by the others 
but his face shows absolute fear. 

“I am suggesting only that 
those whales were frightened by us 
— and fear is normally a condi- 
tioned reflex,” 

Ling gives a little cough. “Ex- 
cuse my interruption, please. But 
it seems that these arguments can- 
not be resolved until we learn 
more about the creatures them- 
selves. Can anyone suggest a tech- 
nique by which we can study them 
at close range?” 

“Not if they run when they 
sense us,” Bromley says. 

Speer adds: “And they de-_ 

IF 




tected us at fifty kilometers, didn’t 
they?” 

“Hew can we get close to 
them?” Ludongo asks. 

Andrei knows. I’m sure. But 
he’s hesitating. Probably used the 
technique hunting whales in the 
Antarctic. We’ve done it in , the 
Navy. What the hell, we’re sup- 
posed to be working together now. 
I’ll break the ice. 

“We can try to spoof the 
whales’ sonar,” I tell them. 

“What’s that?” 

I peek at Andrei again. He’s 
broken into a broad grin. 

“Check the sonar tapes,” I say, 
“to find the frequency that the 
whales used to detect us. Then 
amplify our return signal on that 
same frequency. It’ll make the 
whales think we’re one of them. 
Instead of running, they might let 
us get close.” 

“Exactly,’,’ Andrei agrees. “The 
trick works against terrestrial 
whales. Even against terrestrail 
antisubmarine patrols.” 

We laugh together. For once 
everybody’s in agreement. The 
computer has a record of the so- 
nar frequency the whales put out. 
It’s lower than anything we can 
do. So Andrei goes aft to jury-rig 
one of the transmitters to match 
the whales’ frequency. 

Alone not?. Ship’s completely 
mine again. Feels good. Nothing 
around us. Riding smooth and 
easy.

lene. Haven’t thought about her 
since we left Earth. Maybe it

I T WAS the time we jetted over 
to the Sequoia forest. After , so 
many months training in Texas 
flat scrubland we wanted to see 
mountains and real trees again, 



PRESSURE VESSEL

The park was "tilled with tour- 
ists, even a planeload of scout 
troops from Indonesia. We ducked 
off the main trail and climbed up 
and away from them. The trees 
are as big and tall as booster rock- 
ets — they’ve been standing there 
for two thousand years. Solemn 
as a cathedral. And those damned 
people crawling around clicking 
cameras, yelling after kids, carv- 
ing initials. Sacrilegious. 

“Look at them,” I said to Mar- 
lene when we stopped for breath 
halfway up the slope. “Not a care 
in the world. This damned Titan 
business doesn’t mean a thing to 
them” 

She answered, “Perhaps they 
are “trying very hard to forget 
about Titan.” 

She was inclined to be serious — 
a Germanic trait, I guess. When" 
we had first met, back at the be- 
ginning of training, she had told 
me several times that she wasn’t 
going to fall in love with me be- 
cause the chances were that we’d 
be sent on different missions and 
because she was older than I. But 
six months later we ran off like a 
couple of kids and got married. 
Nobody else knew about it. Very . 
romantic. 

Now we worked ‘our way deeper 
into the forest, hiking up the 
slope, away from the noise of the 
tourists. I had our lunch in my 
backpack. The big trees made a 
canopy of cool shade far overhead 
but every once in a while a shaft 



of- sunlight would break through 
and set off sparkling highlights in 
Marlene’s hair. 

“Actually,” she said thoughtful- 
ly, “life has become much better 
since the discovery of the build- 
ings on Titan. World tensions 
have dried up. The threat of a big 
war is now very dim.” 

I laughed. “Sure. Why worry 
about blowing ourselves to hell 
when there’s a race somewhere 
that can do it for us?” 

“But it’s a much more distant 
threat, a remote possibility. That 
race visited the solar system thou- 
sands of years ago. Perhaps thou- 
sands of centuries ago. They may 
never come back.” 

“Then why are the machines 
still working?” I asked. “And 
what are they doing?” 

“That is the disquieting part of 
it,” she admitted. 

We found a mossy stretch with 
a cold stream sluicing through it. 
We could hear birds and a squir- 
rel chittered at us from the fire- 
hollowed base of a tree. I unslung 
the pack from my shoulders and 
we had lunch. 

“You were there,” I said 
'through a sandwich. “What’s it 
really like?” 

She stopped eating and shook 
her head. “It’s — very hard to de- 
scribe. Not the physical condi- 
tions— you’ve seen films of the 
buildings add you know what Ti- 
tan’s like—” 

“Pretty damned dark and

IF 




gloomy, except when Saturn’s 
up.” 

“There you forget that Saturn’s 
in the sky,” Marlene said. “You 
can — teel — the machinery throb- 
bing. The ground vibrates. When 
you’re near the buildings the sen- 
sation you get — it makes your 
flesh crawl.” 

“They ought to hit it with a 
nukie missile and make everybody 
feel better.” 

“But suppose the machines are 
sending out a signal? Some wave- 
length that we can’t detect? If we 
stop that signal— mightn’t it tell 
those who built the machines that 
it’s time to return to the solar sys- 
tem?” 

Her eyes were wide now with 
real fear. 

I had run out of flip answers. 

“I spent a whole year there,” 
Marlene went on, quieter- now. 
“We knew just as much about the 
machines when I left as when I 
had arrived. We don’t dare dis- 
mantle them. I’m not even sure 
that we could if we tried.” 

I lay back and stared up at the 
green canopy above us. Fresh and- 
alive and good. 

“Must, be like living next to a 
haunted house,” Tmuttered. 

“That’s exactly it,” Marlene 
said, stretching out beside me. 

I put my arm around her shoul- 
ders. Instead of drawing closer to 
me, though, she said, “Bob, I saSv 
a man try to kill himself on Titan. 
The problem got too much for. 



him to bear. We barely got to hiih 
in time.” 

I made a sympathetic noise. 

“Bob — you see, I was in love 
with him. He was married but his 
wife had stayed oh Earth. He nev- 
er knew I loved Him but I did. I 
think I still do.” 

All in a rush. 

I turned and looked at her. “In 
love? Where is he now? How long 
ago—” 

“He’s out of the hospital. I saw 
him yesterday at the center. He’s 
been accepted for star-flight train- 
ing. If he can qualify and get 
through the training he’ll go on a 
star mission.” 

“And you still Jove him.” 

“I’m not. sure. I think I do. His 
wife has divorced him, I believe.” 

“Great.” I forced a smile. “So 
we’ll have a triangle heading out 
for the stars. Maybe we can all 
get freezer beds next to each 
other.” 

That was before I knew I would 
be sent to Jupiter, not on a star 
mission. And before she died.

Andrei’s not yet plugged in. 
Still playing with the sonar. 

“Looks good to me,” I tell him. 

He nods. But he looks sort of 
grim, preoccupied. 

“Yes, I suppose it will do.” He 
hesitates. Then: “Can you handle 
the controls by yourself for a 
while longer? I want to check 
something with Speer:” 

“You feel sick?” 

“I’m having a little trouble 
breathing.” 

I look at him. - He means it. 
“But you’re not breathing. The 
gillsare.” 

Frowning. “Yes, of course. I 
mean I’m having some soreness 
in my chest. Perhaps I’m merely 
tired.” 

“Well, you’d better check it 
out.” 

He puts his hand on my shoul- 
der. “Don’t be worried. It’s noth- 
ing, serious, I’m sure. Speer will 
probably say it’s psychological. 
You know, I really do*n’t enjoy be- 
ing plugged into the ship. It both- 
ers me. It makes me feel less than 
hufnan.” 

“Really? I get just the opposite 
reaction.” 

He bangs my shoulder. “Good... 
I’ll let Speer poke at me and then 
take my rest period. Call me if 
anything unusual develops, will 
you?” 

That’s almost funny. “How do 
you define unusual?” 

\ 



He laughs. “Use your judg- 
ment, comrade.” 

Alone again.- Odd that Andrei 
should feel that way. -Being 
plugged in — it’s beyond being hu- 
man. Lets you think with the

T HE scientists must have been

can see that they’ve all got the so- 
nar display on their screens. An-

there. Nothing will happen for

Sonar view again. “We don’t 
know how sensitive their accousti- 
cal gear is,” I tell the scientists. 
“We’re matching their own out- 
puts as closely as possible. Our 
engine noise is muffled as much 
as we can manage. We should run 
silent in case tlwy’re sensitive to 
other frequencies. Don’t make un- 
necessary noise.” 

.It’s easy to keep quiet. The 
whales are just too awesome for 
words. Even in the gray, ghbstly 
sonar view they look tremendous, 
gliding effortlessly through the 
ocean in a loose herd. We’re gain- 
ing on them slowly, holding our 
breaths.

ting bigger and bigger. Sonar’s

echoes are bouncing around. Dis- 
play’s starting to look like a badly 
tuned television picture. Switch to

Better. They radiate nicely. 
Look slightly orange. They’ve got 
tail flukes something like a whale’s 
— maybe smaller in proportion to 
the body. And a fin or something 
under the gut. Edge closer to 
them, careful, don’t make any 
sudden moves, nothing that will 
scare them. 

Hard to tell their real size, 
nothing to compare them against.

Pulling up astern of them now. 
Feel like a flea trailing an ele- 
phant herd. It would take ten min- 
utes to travel the length of one of 
them with engines on max stan- 
dard power. It’s been two hours 
since we first sighted them. 

Andrei slips quietly into his 
couch. 

“Want the controls?’’ I whis- 
per, glancing at him with the in- 
tercom eyes. 

He shakes his head. “No, you’re 
doing very well.” He pulls the sen- 
sor unit in front of his eyes but 
doesn’t touch any of the controls 



or communications connectors. 

Ling pipes up, “Can we pull 
closer to them?” 

“Don’t go between them,” An- 
drei warns. 

“Are we close enough to use 
TV?” Ludongo asks. 

“What do you think?” I ask 
Andrei. 

“I doubt that they are sensitive 
to light,” he says. “Tiy a few 
short bursts with the laser first, to 
see if there is any reaction.” 

I steer out alongside the herd, 
then settle as close as I dare to 
one of the outer bulls. Not that I 
can tell, a damned thing about 
their spx, if they have any. But 
the outermost whales are the big- 
gest. Laser beam doesn’t seem to 
bother him. Put it on fast scan 
and hook in the TV. Back away so 
we can get the whole animal on 
the viewscreen. 

Listen to the wise men gasp. 

Now we can see them for real,-' 
in color and all. They stagger the 
mind. Built more like an armless 
' squid than anything else. Flukes in 
the tail, but these seem to be more 
for maintaining trim and maneu- 
vering than for propulsion. 

Mammoth open mouth up 
front; maybe it’s permanently 
open. Can’t see any teeth. A si- 
phon under the belly pulses rhyth- 
mically. No wonder they can move 
so fast— they run on jet propul- 
sion. No eyes, no fins except the 
tail flukes. Sleek and streamlined. 
Powerful. Glossy gray-green c_olor.

Mouths big enough to swaHow a 
town. If- they had teeth we’d be 
toothpick size for them. 

Nobody’s saying a word now. 
For once the scientists and I are 
in complete agreement. I could 
watch these giants all day. They’re 
just gliding along in formation, the 
outer bulls weaving back and 
forth a little. Can’t make out any 
really small members inside the 
pack but there’s a pretty tight 
knot of cows in the center. Maybe 
they’re protecting the youngsters. 

From what? 

Every instrument on the ship is 
grinding away. Power drain is at 
max. Just keeping up with these 
whales while they’re grazing is 
straining the engines. 

“Is there any way we can get 
samples of their tissue?” Ling 
asks. I hope he’s being rhetorical. 

Bromley says, “I suppose we 
could slice off a bit with the high- 
power laser.” ' 

I glance at Andrei. 

H E REACHES for the inter- 
com unit. “Our orders are to 
conduct remote observations of 
any life-forms discovered. No di- 
rect contact unless it is forced up- 
on us. No samples, I’m sorry.” 
“Oh, come now,” Bromley ar- 
gues. “A little nick on one of 
those flukes — ” 

“We have no way of knowing 
how the animal would react,” An- 
drei says. “I wouldn’t want to be 
close to one when it started thrash- 



ing around; Well — would you?” 

No answer. Discussion ended. 

“How’re you feeling?” I ask 
him. 

“Not too bad. Speer says he 
can’t find anything physically 
wrong.” 

“Want to rest some more?” 

“No. It’s time for your rest pe- 
riod, isn’t it?” 



“I’m not tired.” 

“Never mind. Go back and 
sleep.” 

It’s funny. He sounds so reluc- 
tant. He doesn’t want to plug in. 
And he ’doesn’t realize how much 
1 don’t want to unplug. 

“Something you ought to 
know.” 1 tell him about the hull, 
show him the computer’s esti- 
mates and then flash the priority 
lists. “I haven’t told the scientists 
about it yet. Observing the whales 
overrides all the other priority 
mission objectives. Looks like 
pressure’s holding steady, even 
though it’s a little high. Probably 
the hull will be okay as long as 
we don’t go any deeper.” 

Andrei still hasn’t plugged in.. I 
can see his whole face. He looks 
positively happy. 

“I understand. We will start the 
twelve-hour priority list and do as 
much as we can. If the hull still is 
good after that we will stretch it 
foe another twelve hours. But 
that’s all. After that we go up.” 
“What do you think the scien- 
tists are going to say?” 

He Shrugs. “That is irrelevant.”

Fine by me. Let him argue with 
them. Andrei slowly plugs himself 
in and takes over control of the. 
ship. It’s time forme to let go.

LUG IN. 

Pain! Lights flashing, ship 
tumbling wildly. 

“What’s the matter? What’s go- 
ing on?” 

I’m slapping on connectors as 
fast as I can. Ship’s lurching like 
a runaway drunk. Andrei looks 
bad. 

“Can’t — control — can’t — ” 

“Speer. Get up here fast.” 

Check all systems. Give me just 
the emergency data.

I’m trying, I’m trying! Outside

“Speer — where the hell are

“I’m right here!” he screams 
through my earphone from a few 
centimeters away. 

Inside view. Speer’s unplugging 
Andrei. Captain’s arms are float- 
ing limply, head lolling ' back, 
mouth sagging open. Ship still 
buffeting. Fighting for control. 
Stabilizer coming around. Slewing 
and rolling. 

“What the hell happened? I was 
in the sack when everything 
seemed to bust , loose.” 



“I don’t know,” Speer . shouts. 
“It all happened so fast. The cap- 
tain yelled something and the ship 
seemed to roll completely over. 
Lights went off for a moment. I 
fell out of my couch. I think 
Ling’s been hurt.” 

Got her righted now. Bounc- 
ing’s smoothing but. Stabilizer 
starting to respond on its own.

Too small. Different shape. Delta

Look like manta rays or sharks. 
Zooming in like rocketplanesT- 
hey, they’re coming right at us! 

Blackout. 

Back to real time. Outside view. 
Still nothing. Whatever they Were, 
they’re gone. 

Intercom. Speer’s got Andrei 
on the emergency couch in the 
medical bay, next to his own com- 
partment. With these damned 
gills you can’t tell if a man’s 
breathing or not. Closeup. Yep, 
the gills are pulsing. But damned 
slow. And why did they have to 
make them green? 

“Speer, hoyfr’s he doing?” 

“I don’t know,” Speer says, 
looking miserable. “He has some 
of the symptoms of shock. Blood 
pressure’s very low. I’m going to 
try pressure cuffs to pump the 
blood back up from his legs and 
lower torso.” 

“Dr: Ling needs help also,” 
Ludongo says. 

Look in on Ling’s compart- 
ment. He’s got a gash on his fore- 
head. Blood seeping out makes a 
reddish cloud that drifts in the 
circulation currents toward the ex- 
haust duct in the overhead. Lu- 
dongo’s in therewith him. 

“It’s not a serious wound,” 
Ling says calmly. “Attend to the 
captain first,” ~ 

“Somebody put a patch on him . 



at least,” I say. 

Ludongo- looks up at the inter- 
com Screen. Bromley, back in his 
own cubicle, says, “I’ll get a first- 
aid kit.” 

Okay. They’re helping each 
other. Ship’s handling all right 
now. Controls still sluggish, 
though. Stabilizer acting okay. 
Andrei must have turned off our 
fake-whale signal. Why? 1 

“Does anyone understand what 
happened to us?” Ludongo asks. 
He’s sitting beside Ling, who now 
has a white plastic gummed on his 
brown skin from one non-existent 
eyebrow halfway back to the top 
of his head. It’s about three times 
more bandage than the cut need- 
ed, but at least the bleeding has 
stopped. 

“We were attacked by the 
sharks — or whatever they were,” 
I tell them. 

Ling agrees. “I was watching 
the viewscreen when it happened. 
The new type of creature is clearly 
a predator.” 

“Sharks,” Bromley mutters. 

“And we outsmarted our- 
selves,” I realize. “Our sonar 
camouflage fooled the sharks. 
They thought we were a whale. 
When the real whales took off and 
we just stood here, they jumped 
us.” 

“But how?!’ Ludongo asks. 
“Did they ram the ship? What did 
they do to us?” 

Good' questions. We rerun the 
tapes. Four times. In ultra-slow

motion. The computer checks 
their sizes, speeds, closing rates. 
Up at the front end of their man- 
ta-shaped bodies is a snout that 
may or may not have a mouth in 
it. They’re about a quarter of the 
size of the whales — still more than 
three times our size; And the com- 
puter is very definite that the 
nearest shark was still half a kilo- 
meter away from us when Andrei 
shouted -and the ship went hay- 
wire. 

Now we’re all silent. Very, very 
silent. Speer standing Over the 
captain. Ling on his couch, with 
the other two beside him. And me 
up on the flight deck. 

The sharks have something that 
can knock this ship for a loop. 
Something that acts over a range 
of half a kilometer. A weapon. 

“'V7'OU’R ! E not suggesting that 
they’re actually intelligent?” 
Bromley asks finally, his voice 
strained. 

‘‘Who can say?” Ludongo re- 
plies. “Are dolphins intelligent?” 

‘‘We must learn more about 
them,” Ling says. 

“But how?” 

“Decoy them again,” I answer. 
“Put on our whale camouflage 
and wait for them to find us.” 

“We can’t risk it,” says Speer. 
“The captain’s been hurt. What 
happens if you—” His voice drops 
out. 

Bromley chips in, “Yes, and 
how long can you stay at the con- 



trols of thi& ship without Collaps- 
ing from fatigue? I vote that we 
get out while we’re still able to. 
We’ve already discovered much 
more than anyone expected us 
to.” 

’ “Still,” Ling says, “it would be 
extremely valuable to study these 
creatures further. If they are in- 
telligent — ” 

I tell them, “Discovery of an in- 
telligent creature falls under our 
primary mission objective. The 
most important task we have is to 
determine if the sharks are intelli- 
gent or not. 

“Wait,” Bromley says. “What 
about the hull? The captain told 
us while you were sleeping that 
the hull is showing signs of corro- 
sion and we must pull out in 
twelve hours. So any further argu- 
ments are purely academic.” 

“We still have twelve hours to 
see what we can accomplish,” I 
say. “And longer if we need it.” 
“What about the captain him- 
self?” Sheer asks. “We should be 
getting him to proper -medical 
treatment.” 

“Will twelve hours be critical?” 
I ask. , 

“Of course. Twelve minutes 
might be critical. I can’t really 
diagnose him accurately here.” 
What would Andrei do if I were 
stretched out on the couch? 
Twelve hours. He’s in shock. If 
he’s lived through the first few 
minutes he ought to be okay. 
Speer can take care of him. Ship’s

all mine now — the decisions are 
mine to make. Another twelve 
hours. All mine for another twelve 
hours. Maybe longer. 

“We’ll stay,” I tell them. 
“Speer, let me know if he gets any 
worse. We’ll put out the< whale 
sonar signal. If the sharks show 
up we’ll try some long-range looks 
at them and then turn off the 
whale signal.” - 

“If they have any intelligence 
at all,’ 1 Bromley says, “the sonar 
camouflage won’t fool them. 
They’ll know we’re not a whale:” 
“It fooled them once.” 

“Did it?” 

Hadn’t thought of that. Ignore 
it. “Okay. The computer will give 
each of you a priority list of mea- 
surements that must be made. 
Carry out as many as you can, 
starting at the top of the list. If 
and when we make contact with 
alien life-forms, all instruments 
will be devoted to getting as much 
data on them as possible.” 

Bromley mutters, “Another 
ruddy admiral handing down or- 
ders to his deck hands.” 

But they’re getting to work. 
Keep them busy. Suppose the 
sharks are intelligent? Suppose 
they’re the ones who built the ma- 
chines on Titan? What kind of 
weapon did they use on the. ship? 
What else do they have?

Okay, okay — But it wasn’t 
much of. anything. It was kind of 
mixed up, wierd. Part of it was 
the last time I saw Marlene. 

I HAD already been fitted out 
with gills. They had us living in 
test tanks. The banjos connected 
with the lake and we could spend 
our free time there if we felt like 
it. I had been there for an hour 
or so, watching the dolphins they 
had stocked the lake with. To 
keep us company, I guess. 

Marlene had not told me she 
was coming to see me. She just 
showed up with a tank strapped 
to her back and her face covered 
by a goggled mask. But I recog- 
nized her immediately. Even with 
her hair pulled back I knew her 
the instant I saw her. 

“They’ve taken off all your 
hair,” was the first thing she said 
from inside the mask. 

“More than you know,” I an-

swered. I was wearing my trunks. 

We swam for a long time, 
hooked rides on the dolphins, 
talked about trivialities, hardly 
* touched each other. 

“I’ve got my assignment,” she 
said at last. “Sirius.” 

“Same as your friend?” 

“Yes.” 

“Was it a tough job to wangle 
the same mission? Did you have 
to- lay any of the administrators 
or personnel people?” 

“Bob, don’t be — ” 

“Don’t be what?” I asked. 

And somehow it was a different 
time and place. I was standing in 
front of a desk, in. my Navy uni- 
form, while a fat civilian was tell- 
ing me, Don’t be disappointed 
that you weren’t accepted for a 
star mission. Only a handful of 
the very finest scientists, bhd 
spacemen could be picked. 
There’s an even more challenging 
assignment waiting for you, if 
you’re willing to tackle it .. 

I must have asked him what it 
was. 

Jupiter. .Far more dangerous 
and hostile than any star mission. 
The most difficult challenge we 
have ever faced. And possibly 
the most important. Certainly the 
most rigorous mission we’ve at- 
tempted so far . 

Note the we. He never got clos- 
er to Jupiter than the men’s room 
down the hall from his office. 

The Jupiter mission Is so hos- 
tile that we’re only accepting sin- 



gle men for it. He hesitated a beat, . 
then: There’s been a rumor that 

you ... 

I’m not married, I said to him. 
I was once but she’s, dead now. 
I’m single. 

The dream changed again. I 
was" standing alone, watching as 
Marlene died. The details were 
confused, mixed up. The noise 
was shattering. Flame and 
smoke. People shouted and 
pointed. 

CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE

No, it’s all a jumble.

“Will he make it?”

side of the whale group. Probably 
they haven’t picked us up at all. 

They’re sharks, no doubt about 
it. Can’t tell their sizes or shapes 
at this distance. But just watch- 
ing them move you can see they’re 
completely different from the 
whales. They’re hunters. And 
killers. 

“Sonar contact. Twelve 
sharks,” I say on the intercom. 

The scientists snap to life, stare 
at the sonar display. ,, 

“Observe max safety proced- 
ures,”! tell them. They’re already

So far the whales haven’t de-

are still out at the edge of our de- 
tection range. But now they’re 
splitting up into smaller groups — 
two or three each. 

“My God, they’re going to sur- 
round the whales!” Bromley’s 
voice, awe-stricken. 

“Rather intelligent behavior,” 
Ling says softly. 

Ludongo, “Many predators on 
Earth are equally intelligent. The 
lion, for instance. And the wolf.” 

Two of the sharks are circling' 
around behind the whales while 
the rest are deploying themselves 



ahead of the whales and along 
their flanks. The whales still 
haven’t noticed theih. 

Speer says, “They’re going to 
be butchered—” 

TWO CONTACTS AP- 
PROACHING FORTY-FIVE

“Shouldn’t you be turning off 
the whale signal?” Bromley asks. 

Ludongo says, “If we turn off 
the camouflage signal the real 
whales might sense us and bolt.” . 

“That could save their lives,” 
says Ling. “Surely many of them 
will be killed if they don’t begin 
to run soon.” 

“Mission objectives clearly state 
we are not to interfere with local 
ecological patterns,” I remind 
them. “However, ship safety re-

— follow them in. The whales fi- 
nally sense them. Look at thenr 
buck. The whales are faster than 
the sharks — at least for short 
sprints. They’re going to bull right 
past the sharks and break free. 

G OD ALMIGHTY— lightning 
bolts! Electric blasts arching 
from the sharks to the whales. 
Blank out the eyes when they 
flash. They’re paralyzing the 
whales with electricity. 

“Stop them — kill them,” Brom- 
ley’s shouting. “Don’t let them do 
it — use the laser on the sharks — ” 
The sharks are doing a thor- 
ough job.' Electric bolts stun the 
whales. Then the sharks latch on 
with their snouts, like lamprey 
eels. Looks like they suck the 
juices from the whales, instead of 
eating the meat. Most of the 
whales have two or , three sharks 
attached to them now, drifting 
slowly, sinking. 

One of the youngsters has man- 
aged to keep clear of them. He’s 
heading our way, emitting all 
sorts of high-pitched peeps. Three 
sharks closing in on him. 

“Save him,” Bromley shrieks. 
“Don’t let them get him— ” 

“Our mission is to observe, not 
interfere.” • 

This time it happens no farther 
than ten kilometers from us. In- 
frared picks up good detail. 

The little whiale isn’t much big- 
ger than our ship. He’s fast but 
the sharks have an angle on him. 



Closing fast. Youngster’s screech- 
ing louder and louder. Or maybe 
it’s just the Doppler effect. There 
goes the. lightning — was that 
Bromley groaning? Eyes recovered , 
now. Whale’s dead in the water. 
One shark already stuck into 
him, other two move in and hook 
on. The sceneis obscene. 

Ludongo says, “Now we know 
how they attacked us. An electric 
arc— it makes an effective wea- 
pon.” 

“But a completely natural one,” 
Ling says, sounding a little sub- 
dued. “They apparently have no 
artifacts.” 

“The captain must’ve been 
jolted when theif electric arcs hit 
the ship. Doubt he got an elec- 
trical shock — the systems are pro- 
tected 'against that. But having 
several bolts slam into the ship 
and overpower all the controls 
and sensors must have been 
enough to send him into — what 
do you call it, Speer?” 

“Physiological shock.” 

“Yes. Does that help you? Can 
you treat him better now?” 

“Not really.” He sounds sul- 
len. Outside view shows the baby 
whale and its three leeches drift- 
ing just below us now. “Why did 
you have to let them get the little 
one?” 

L flick a look at him. He’s prac- 
tically in tears. Bromley’s livid. 
It’s hard to tell what Ludongo’s 
expression means. Ling’s impas- 
sive but very quiet now. Sheer

emotionalism. The whale was 
panicked and running blind. It 
wasn’t heading for us deliberately. 
It couldn’t know that we might 
have helped it. 

Ling speaks up. “It seems there 
is a considerable amount of Jov- 
ian tissue nearby. Will it possible 
to sample it?” 

Looking out again, I see that 
the sharks have detached from 
the baby whale. It’s still close to 
us but starting to sink faster. The 
sharks have gone. There are no 
living creatures left nearby.

Ling uses the high-powered 
laser to vaporize some of the 
whale’s flash. Studies the light 
on spectrophotometer. Ludongo 
helps by probing the animal with 
high-frequency sonar to get some 
idea of density. Bromley tries neu- 
tron beam probe but returns look 



too weak to be intelligible. Either 
not much solid structure inside 
the baby or Bromley’s still too up- 
set to work instruments. 

“Speer, how’s the captain’s con- 
dition?” 

He looks up from the sick bay 
couch. “Worse. His breathing rate 
is slower. I think the higher pres- 
sure down at this depth is bother- 
ing him.” 

Check internal monitor. “But 
the internal pressure’s only up 
-one point one percent.” 

“I don’t care what the numbers 
are,” he says, frowning angrily. 
“His gill rate is getting critical. 
It’s getting hard for me to breathe, 
too. My gill rate’s slowed down — 
I’ve checkedit.” 

Pressure shouldn’t bother them. 
Check performance ratings for 
gill systems. Curve shows pressure 
versus oxygen production. Now 
superimpose ship’s current inter- 
nal pressure readings. Pressure is 
approaching the critical point but 
is not there yet. 

Whale is still sinking. 

“Dr. Ling, we will exceed safe- 
ty margins if we go deeper.” 

“Do you have all the data you, 
want?” Ludongo asks. 

Ling smiles into the camera. “It 
would take several generations to 
get all the data that I desire. But 
I have accomplished far more 
than I expected to. I can stop 
-now if you wish.” 

Good. Set course for surface

Possible causes of stabilizer

ternate circuit. If hydraulic, back- 
up system should work. But if ex- 
ternal pressure has overloaded the 
system — and ship’s still nosing 
deeper— : we’re in trouble. 

Flick on the intercom. “Gen- 
tlemen, the stabilizer system is 
temporarily inoperative.” 

Explain it to them. Watch their 
faces. Each one shows fear. 

“Isn’t there anything we can 
do?” Bromley asks. - 

“Computer is working on the 
problem.” 

“You could use engine thrust to 
push us up out of this depth,” 
Ludongo says. “Perhaps at lower 
pressures the stabilizer will work 
again.” 

He’s running his hands along 
the edge of his couch as he speaks. 

“That might be tried if nothing 
else works.” 

“Why not now?” Speer asks. 



“It would take an excessive 
amount of propulsion power to lift 
the ship while the stabilizer is 
pointing us down. There might 
not be enough power left to lift 
out of the atmosphere and return 
to orbit.” 

“There is nothing for us to do 
but wait?” asks Ling. 

“That’s right.” 

“Tell me,” Bromley says, his 
voice calm except for a slight 
tremor. “How long can we remain 
in this attitude before we reach a 
depth that.will crush the ship?” 

“Insufficient data.” 

They lapse into silence. Ludon- 
go turns again to his workbench. 
Bromley leans back on his couch.

Speer is fidgeting around the cap-

Ludongo calls, “O’Banion, why

to take us up just a little? There’s 
no sense staying at this depth.” 

“Not yet necessary. May be 
possible to identify the fault and 
correct it before critical depth is 
reached.” 

Bromley says, “Is that O’Ban- 
ion talking or the computer?” 

“I — I can’t tell,” Ludongo says, 
sounding shocked. 

S PEER gets up from his couch 
and heads from Bromley’s 
compartment. No, not Bromley’s. 
Ling’s. 

“Could I speak with you. Dr. 
Ling? In private?” 

Ling’s been running tapes of 
our encounter with the sharks 
when they slaughtered the whale 
family. He blinks once at Speer, 
then reaches out and turns off his 
intercom connections. Blank now.

“O’Banion, this is Ludongo

comfortable in here. Can’t you 
take us up at least a little way?” 

Bromley: “I thought it was only

Dr. Speer for tranquilizers.” 

“He’s talking like the- ruddy 
computer,” Bromley insists. 

The intercom in Ling’s com- 
partment flicks back on. Speer 
leaves, returns to the sick bay. 

“This pressure is hurting the 
captain,”- he says, squinting at 
the monitor board above Voron- 
ov’s head. “His breathing rate is 
going down steadily.” 

“Check for gill malfunction.” 
Why does someone have to spell 
out everything fot him? 

“For God’s sake,” Bromley 
shouts. “Take us up! Can’t you 
see we’re starting to die in here? 
We’re too deep — we can’t stand it 
here much longer — ”

“All systems are within toler- 
able limits.” 

“But the people aren’t,” Brom- 
ley yells. “Damn the machines — 
the people are dying. Damn you 
military heroes — you’re driving 
us to death. It was a mistake to 
trust our lives to you.” 

“Systems indicate your reac- 
tion is purely emotional, possibly 
close to hysteria. Dr. Speer, 
please — ” 

“May I interrupt?” Ling’s 
voice slides in smoothly. “Al- 
though all the systems appear to 
be operating within tolerable 
limits, as you say, I suggest that 
there is one system that may be 
working at less then nominal 
values.” 

“Which one?” 

“Thepilot.” 

He means the human pilot. 
Operating at less than nominal 
value. Noway to check that. 

Ling goes on: “You have been 
at the controls steadily now for 
more than twelve hours. If noth- 
ing else, fatigue may be clouding 
your judgment. Perhaps you 
should check the computer’s 
memory for the operating proced- 
ures specified for situations such 
as this. I believe that they call for 
computer control of the ship while 
the pilot rests.” 

“Computer control unfeasible 
during emergency situation.” He 
should know that. 

“Then perhaps you could use 
the engine thrust to lift us to a 



safer pressure and afterward take 
your rest.” 

“Suggestion unfeasible.” 

Speer: “He’s withdrawing more 
and more.” 

“He’S becoming part of the 
computer,” Bromley says. 

He’s talking nonsense But his 
voice sounds strangely hushed, no 
longer raving. 

“What can we do about it?”' 
asks Ludongo.

Damn mission- objective four-

talk. 

I — it was the same dream. I saw 
Marlene die again. Only this time 
I recognized where it happened. 

I was in my tank, watching her 
booster launch on the TV screen 
in my compartment. I had asked 
to go to the launch but they would 
not risk letting any of us out of 
the water, even in special pressure 
suits. Marlene was lifting off for 
rendezvous with the starship. He 
was already aboard, waiting in 
orbit for her, waiting to go with 
her to Sirius. Her booster mal- 
functioned. It exploded on the 
pad, I guess. 

And then — somehow I was 
standing there at the pad, naked. 
I could feel the heat from the 
flames on my skin. The smoke' 
from the explosion was swirling 
all around. You could hear alarm 
sirens and people shouting. Some- 
body — it was Bromley! He was 
dressed in the admiral’s uniform 



and shouting at me above all the 
noise. 

It’s your fault — you killed 
her . 

I’m cold — God, I feel cold. I 
tried to tell him it wasn’t true, 
that I had nothing to do with it — 
but the dream changed, shifted. I 
was back in that stupid office with 
that fat civilian telling me I had 
been turned down for the star 
missions. 

I’m sorry. There are just so 
many berths on the starships, and 
■we had to take the absolute cream 
of the crop. But there will be other 
missions . 

I’ll be too old for the next 
round of star flights. By the time 
they come back from these first 
missions and the next round starts 
I’ll be an old man ... 

Yes, but you’re still young 
enough to perform a vital job for 
us. 

But Speer’s younger than I am, 
I said. 

Which was crazy, because, at 
that point in reality I had not yet 
even met Speer. ’

“Then why did you think she

“She is dead. For me she’s dead. 
By the time she comes back from

She’ll be about thirty-five. I’ve 
lost her for good — remember now

she’s dead — ” 

Speer: “But your dreams kept

make him good as new.”

I HAD rarely seen Duckworth 
in so ebullient a mood. His 
tiny eyes sparkled. His normally 
pale cheeks were aglow with color 
and his wispy beard fluttered like a 
royal pennant. 

“You’ve won the state lottery?” 
I cried. 

He shook his head. His federal 
research grants had been sharply 
slashed and he had taken to past- 
ing lottery tickets on the walls of 
his laboratory for all visitors to 
see. 

“It’s not that at all,” growled 
Duckworth. “I’ve come up with a 
new idea and it has exciting pos- 
sibilities.” 

He drew up a rickety laboratory 
stool and gingerly lowered his 
rump 'as he began to' sketch out 
penciled squares on a lined yellow 
pad. 

“I can’t make it' out,” I said, 
staring at the irregular lines. 

“All a matter of recordings,” 
said Duckworth. “To take a sim- 
ple example, consider sound. 
We’ve captured the analogue of 
sound waves on disks, then on wire 
— and currently on magnetic 
tape.” 

I nodded. 

“And in the case of light,” I 
said, “we’ve recorded it on glass 
plates, then film and now on pho- 
tochromic materials.” 

“That’s the point,” said Duck- 
worth. “And by use of the holo- 
gram we can lock up interference 
patterns into a tiny space, which 



can be used to reconstitute a three- 
dimensional image at some other 
time.” 

“Well, that takes care of sound 
and light,” I said. “There’s still 
taste, touch and smell.” 

Duckworth leaned forward in a 
conspiratorial manner. 

“And feeling,” he added. 
“Feeling?” 

“The full emotional impact of 
an event, once experienced, just as 
it happened to you,” said Duck- 
worth. “Just imagine what it 
would be like to relive an exquisite, 
once-in-a-lifetime experience and 
savor once again all its joys. It 
would mean that one could trans-

Old man, every middle-aged cou- 
ple that’s lost the freshness of the 
honeymoon era.” 

“You’re an incurable roman- 
tic,” I said. “But I get. your, point. 
The great part of living is made up 
of tedium, trials and tribulations. 
The high spots are quite rare.” 

“But they don’t have to be,” said 
Duckworth. “I have worked out a 
way of locking them up, ready to 
be recaptured and relived at will 
over and over again,” 

My jaw dropped. 

“If . you have,” I said, “then 
you’ve outdone yourself. It sounds 
utterly impossible to me;” 

“So would holography have 
seemed a hundred years ago,” said 
Duckworth. 

He rose from his stool suddenly. 
It clattered to the floor.

IF 




‘‘Come along,” he said, “and 
I’ll show you what I mean.” 

H E DASHED off down the 
corridor to his animal room, 
unbuttoned lab coat fluttering 
around him. I followed warily. 1 
had many a bump and bruise to 
show from iron test-tube stands 
and dismantled fraction collectors 
that were set about in unlikely 
places. Duckworth flipped on the 
main light switch and pointed 
exultantly at six small cages set on 
a table in the middle of the room. 
Each one held a single white rat. 

He stroked his beard reflective- 
ly- 

“I suppose I ought to give you 
some preliminary information,” 
he muttered to himself. 

“Please.” 

“Look at it thfe way,” said the 
great biochemist. “The internal ef- 
fects of a real-life experience on a 
sentient being must affect all the 
senses. Somewhere in the nervous 
system is a terminal cell or set of 
cells for each peripheral receptor. 
The pathways may not be easy to 
find. Butvin these terminal cells 
every split second of experience is 
electrochemically recorded and 
stored sequentially. We can all, by 
means of a crude memory recall, 
relive very approximately some 
past experience. The reason for the 
roughness of the recall is that the 
record of the experience is clut- 
tered over by the interfering effects 

Amatter'of RECORDINGS 



of innumerable previous experi- 
ences and the hash of succeeding 
events. Besides, even without inter- 
ference, there would be some de- 
generation in the record as time 
went by.” 

“I can accept your hypothesis,” 

I said. “But how can you possibly 
retrieve the information of these 
records, particularly in the correct 
sequence.” 

Duckworth’s eyes ' began to 
gleam again. 

“First I freeze the records,” he 
said. “In that way there can be no 
loss of information. And then I re- 
trieye every bit of data in proper 
sequence.” 

I threw up my hands. 

“How?” 

. “By combining old and new 
techniques,” said Duckworth. 
“For many years we’ve been able 
to map cortical areas in the mam- 
malian brain which correspond to 
various sensory inputs. Into the 
brain of each one of these rats I’Ve 
implanted thousands of tiny inte- 
grated circuits, charge-sensitive 
oscillators. Local temperature dif- 
ferences are sufficient to provide 
the necessary energy to power 
these oscillators, each of which 
operates at a different carrier fre- 
quency. The charge pattern varia- 
tions, both in amplitude and time, 
are telemetered to my special pur- 
pose receiver-computer. It receives 
the information just as it comes, 
converts it to binary . form and 
stores it on magnetic tape.” 

45 




“Can your little implanted oscil- 
lator receive information as well as 
transmit?” 

“You’ve caught on,” said Duck- 
worth. 

“By playing back the stored pat- 
tern in the proper sequence,” I 
said, “you restimulate the appro- 
priate sites of the cortex and the 
animal re-experiences every sensa- 
tion as he once felt it.” 

“Bravo,” said Duckworth. 
“That’s just what I’ve done with 
these rats. I can make each one 
salivate as though he were eating. 
I can send him into paroxysms of 
terror or even arouse him sexually, 
depending on which of his experi- 
ences I play back.” 

“Will one animal respond to an- 
other’s recordings?” 

“In principle it can be done,” 
said Duckwortfy. “But it would re- 
quire the utmost care in matching 
up corresponding sites.” 

'I fixed my eyes on his. 

“Are you thinking of trying out 
this scheme on a human being?” 
Duckworth shrugged. 

“I’ve been toying with the idea,” 
he admitted. “But choosing and 
convincing the subject might be a 
ticklish matter. There are surgical 
'risks.” 

“To put it mildly,” I said. I 
backed away from him. “Don’t 
consider me,” I warned. “I cherish 
some of the finer moments of my 
bygone past— but not that much.” 

. “I know,” said Duckworth. “I 
suspect that anyone I’d approach 



would react the same way. And yet 
the rewards could be so great. I 
wonder if I’ve been wasting my 
time?” 

“You haven’t,” I assured him. 

“Publish your results and you’ll

see. 

I HAD no idea then of how pro- 
phetic my remarks were. Duck- 
worth’s sober and rather stodgy 
account of his method of record- 
ing sensations appeared first in an 
eminent scientific journal. I ex- 
pected him to get a few crackpot 
responses but I had totally under- 
estimated the number. 

“I’ve been flooded with thou- 
sands of nutty requests from auto- 
eroticists,” said Duckworth wear- 
ily. 

He had sidled into.the Computer 
Laboratory where I was debugging 
a new program to be used in his 
system. I shook my head sadly. 

“.It’s an unfortunate truism that 
every nut in the world is'attracted 
by this kind of scheme.” 

“But some of these letters are 
beyond belief,” said Duckworth. 
“And I thought I was a man- 
about-town!” He waved a heavily 
embossed piece of stationery at 
me. “This one is from the Nazir of 
Waddam. I’ve known him for 
years. Cap you guess what . he 
wants?” 

“I know what he wants,” I said. 
“He asks you to record all his cur- 
rent amatory exploits in his harem, 
for replaying in his old age.” 



46 



IF 




“How did you guess?” said 
Duckworth. 

He was awestruck by my pre- 
science. 

I shrugged off the question. It 
had been purely a matter of em- 
pathy. I had simply put myself in 
the Nazir’s place. 



T HE demented and oddball 
amateurs posed one type of 
problem but each one could be 
dealt with. The serious difficul- 
ties arose when the professionals 
appeared on the scene like a swarm 
of locusts. Each one had a sure- 
fire deal in mind and talked in 
large amounts of dollars. I was 
afraid that Duckworth might be 
tempted. Maintaining his research 
on inadequate funds was wearing 
him out. And his professional sal- 
ary was quite modest. But he with- 
stood all temptations, direct and 
oblique. 

One chap persevered however. 
He was unstoppable, loquacious 
and imaginative. His name was 
Hart- Felsen, a short stout man in 
his late forties, wearing a floppy 
straw hat in the manner of vintage 
Sidney Greenstreet films. His 
clothes were of first quality, sug- 
gesting distinguished Saville Row 
tailors, but his bulging form in- 
serted wrinkles everywhere. 

Felsen appeared at the university 
and made his first approach to 
Duckworth through the head of the 
chemistry department. After being 



rebuffed he tried the dean’s office 
and finally appealed to President 
Hinkle, all to no avail. 

Felsen remained undiscouraged. 

To supplement his research 
funds Duckworth reluctantly de- 
cided to take on some consulta- 
tion work for one of the more 
reputable drug houses. Sometimes 
these meetings took the form of a 
working luncheon. With consum- 
mate artistry Felsen contrived to 
wangle an invitation to one of 
these luncheons. He began to chat 
with Duckworth on the decline in 
the quality of modern wines and 
drew a frosty blank. But a chance 
sally on the inferior workmanship 
of new Bunsen burners drew a 
warm response. A little later Fel- 
sen broached the subject of Duck- 
worth’s recent paper and revealed 
an amazingly thorough under- 
standing of what was involved. 
Duckworth was impressed with 
the acuity of his observations. 

“Could this system be fabri- 
cated in portable packages?” asked 
Felsen. 

“It’s all portable now,” said 
Duckworth. “The receiver-com- 
puter weighs under ten ounces, 
batteries included.” 

Felsen licked his lips. 

“Dr. Duckworth,” he said, try- 
ing vainly to lean forward against 
the inertia of his waistline. “Might 
it be possible for one person to 
respond to another’s recordings?” 

“You may recall,” said Duck- 
worth, “that in my paper I dis- 



A MATTER OF RECORDINGS - 47 




cussed this very point. I stated that 
it would require very careful map- 
ping of the proper cortical sites in 
each individual to make certain of 
an exact correspondence.” 

‘‘Of course,” said Felsen, “how 
stupid of me to forget.” 

But his eyes glowed and he ate 
voraciously thereafter. 

A WEEK later Felsen appeared 
at Duckworth’s laboratory 
with a ten-page proposal and a 
multimillion-dolfar contract in 
hand. Duckworth refused to read 
either one. 

‘*Don’t be foolish,” said Felsen. 
“You could become completely in- 
dependent of government grants 
and do whatever you wanted to 
do. Besides, there’s more than 
money at stake here. You know 
what pleasure people get from 
audio recordings. Just picture the 
reaction to a catalogue of different 
joyous experiences; We could of- 
fer the experiences of presidents, 
surgeons, movie stars, courtesans. 
The potential for exploration, 
stimulation and excitement is un- 
limited and the monetary rewards 
incalculable.” 

“It’s not what I orginally had in 
mind,” said Duckworth glumly. 
“It would lie a gross perversion of 
my basic idea.” 

Felsen removed his straw hat 
and fanned his perspiring florid 
cheeks. 

“Let’s forget individual pleas- 
ures and cash rewards,” he said. 



“Let's think in grander terms. 
What about One World At Peace? 
Just think what it might mean if, 
for the first time, an American 
president could actually experience 
the feelings of a Russian premier 
and vice versa. Two otherwise 
hostile peoples could interchange 
vital life experiences with one an- 
other. For the first time in the his- 
tory of mankind a real path to 
permanent peace between nations 
might be in our grasp.” 

Duckworth was shaken but only 
momentarily. 

“It sounds good,” he said, “too 
good. I don’t believe the idea could 
ever be implemented. Not only 
two hostile individuals but two 
hostile nations would have to 
agree to submit wholesale to very 
delicate brain surgery to. make it 
all possible. If these people can’t 
agree now on less substantive mat- 
ters, how could we ever get agree- 
ment on your proposals?” 

“Nations have traded hostages 
before this,” said Felsen. “This 
scheme would simply be another 
variation on the hostage idea. Give 
it a chance, Duckworth. Give gen- 
erations yet unborn a chance.” 
Duckworth was pale. 

“No,” he said. “I’m not inter- 
ested in your idea.” 

And that, he thought, ended 
that. 

It seemed to, although for days 
thereafter Duckworth swore that 
he was being tailed in the streets 
and even oh the campus. He main-

tained that olive-skinned men bad 
been lurking about, some in the 
burnous of the Middle East. Once, 
as 1 walked at his side, he nudged 
me and gestured at, a horny- 
handed laborer type who walked 
stolidly behind me, his trouser 
cuff s white with cement dust. 

“See what I mean?” hissed 
Duckworth. 

He moved his elbow knowingly 
once again at the laborer. 

“He looks more Italian to me 
than Near-Eastern,” I said. 
“You’re becoming absolutely 
paranoid.” . 

My triumph was complete when 
the laborer joined a construction 
crew working on the new south 
campus building. Duckworth 
looked a bit sheepish, then he 
sighed. 

“Even paranoids have enemies,” 
he said. 



T EN days later Felsen accosted 
us in the computer laboratory. 
Duckworth stiffened as Felsen 
waved a puffy hand in greeting. 

“Dr. Duckworth,” he ;said 
warmly. “You’ve passed the test.” 
“What test?” snarled Duck- 
worth. 

“Let me explain,” said Felsen. 
“I am really an emissary from 
your old friend, the Nazir of Wad- 
dam. His remembrances of your 
integrity, your courage and your 
genius have lingered with him over 
the years. But he wasn’t quite cer- 



tain that your character was un- 
changed — ” 

“He hasn’t changed much,” said 
Duckworth. “I have a letter from 
him suggesting an erotic use of my 
recording system.” 

“I know,” said Felsen, “that 
was part of the test, believe me. 
But now we can dispense with all 
pretense and get down to the heart 
of the matter. The Nazir wants 
you to come to Waddam. He has a 
most important proposition to put 
to you. He will pay generously.” 
“I’m too busy at the moment,” 
said Duckworth. “I can’t spare the 
time.” 

“Too busy? Can’t spare the 
time? Is this what you say to the 
man who offered you refuge in 
your time of need?” 

He was alluding of course to 
Duckworth’s flight when the news 
had broken years earlier about his 
macromolecule. Duckworth just 
tugged at his beard reflectively. 

“I have responsibilities here,” 
he said. “Graduate students, lab- 
oratory assistants, grant renewal 
requests. Without my presence the 
whole program here might go 
down the drain.” 

“Splendid,” said Felsen. “I’m 
sure your laboratory would bene- 
fit from a large grant-in-aid from 
the government of Waddam with 
no strings attached.” 

“It sure would,” I interjected. 
Felsen beamed at me warmly. 
“And,” he added, “the Nazir 
has also requested the presence of 



A MATTER OF RECORDINGS 49 




your friend. We feel that his com- 
puter experience will bp of great 
help in our project. The consul- 
tant’s fee will be quite handsome.” 

A ND so it was that Duckworth 
and I were flown to Waddam 
in the luxuriously mounted private 
jet of the Nazir. The Nazir was at 
the airport in person to greet us. 
He embraced Duckworth, his 
cheeks wet with tears. 

Duckworth stepped back out of 
his arms. 

“You’ve forgiven me about the 
matter of the harem?” he said. 

The Nazir waved his hands ef- 
fusively. 

“It never happened,” he said 
grandly. 

At this point I was introduced 
to the Nazir and received a rather 
perfunctory handshake. The Nazir 
was a tall man whose hawklike 
proboscis seemed to dwarf even 
Duckworth’s magnificent beak. 
He wore the long flowing robes of 
his hereditary office and his fingers 
were completely covered with rings 
set with enormous diamonds, 
rubies and emeralds. I thought it 
was a vulgar display and said so to 
Duckworth. 

“It’s all a matter of taste,” said 
Duckworth. “Personally, I think 
they’re colorful.” 

We were escorted into the air- 
conditioned Cadillac of the Nazir 
and whisked to his palace, some 
fifteen miles from the airport. It 
was a stunning edifice in alabaster 



white, with cunningly fashioned 
minarets, winding stairways and 
limpid pools everywhere. The East 
Wing was under heavy guard. 

“The harem,” muttered Duck- 
worth. 

After a lavish dinner that set my 
gall bladder into violent reprisals, 
the Nazir, with Felsen at his elbow, 
put his proposal to Duckworth. 

“I am a humane man as you 
know, Duckworth. I abhor vio- 
lence and bloodshed.” 

Duckworth looked skeptical but 
said nothing. 

“After learning of your scientif- 
ic publication from Mr. Felsen 
here,” resumed the Nazir, “I con- 
ceived of a magnificent plan to end 
turmoil, disruption and misery in 
my country.” 

Duckworth leaned forward. 

“Then you’re going to share 
some of your oil royalties with the 
people? Congratulations,” said 
Duckworth warmly. 

Felsen coughed and studied the 
end of his five-dollar cigar. The 
Nazir looked alarmed. 

“Heavens no,” he said. “I have 
a much less sordid plan to offer. 
As I see it, the rift that exists be- 
tween me and my people is due to 
a lack of mutual understanding. 
They think that my life is simply 
one of sybaritic luxury. They can- 
not conceive of the preparations, 
the planning,, the administrative 
details, in short, the aggravation I 
go through. I want to end all that.” 

Felsen puffed smoke. 



50 



IF 




“If I may interrupt. Your High- 
ness?’’ he said deferentially. 

The Nazir oodded. 

“What his Highness wishes to 
say is that in the interest of his 
people, he is willing to volunteer 
to have the necessary surgery to 
implant your transducers in his 
cortex. The leader of the revolu- 
tionaries, a fiercely stubborn man 
now in custody, will undergo the 
same operation, r You gentlemen 
will thereupon record the emotions 
and frustrations of the Nazir dur- 
ing a typical morning’s~work. This 
recording will be transmitted over 
and over to the brain of our revolu- 
tionary friend. He will then be able 
to communicate to his comrades 
the terrible hardship of being the 
Nazir.” 

“All a matter 6f empathy,” said 
Duckworth. 

The Nazir beamed. 

“Duckworth,” he said, “you’re 
every bit as understanding as 
ever.” 

“You bet,” said Duckworth. 
“And I suppose -you hadn’t 
thought of recording your harem 
exploits afterward?” 

“To be honest,” said the Nazir, 
“I had. But that was a secondary 
benefit. What your military indus- 
trialists refer to as ‘spinoff.’ ” ! 

“Well, my answer is no,” said 
Duckworth tartly. “I’ll have no 
part of this outrageous scheme. In- 
stead of dealing honestly with your 
people, you want to trick them.” . 

“If I dealt honestly with this 

A MATTER OF RECORDINGS 



scoundrel of a revolutionary,” said 
the Nazir, “I’d boil him in oil. But 
I want to use a modern, humane 
approach.” 

“The brain surgery is difficult,” 
said Duckworth. “The physical 
risks may be great. I’d have to 
tutor a surgeon on every single 
step of the procedure. Is it worth 
all this to you?” 

“My dear Duckworth,” said the 
Nazir. “I’m sitting on a revolu- 
tionary volcano that’s ready to 
erupt 'momentarily. If my enemies 
win, it will cost me my oil, my 
palace, my life, even my harem. If 
your scheme should work it would 
be worth every bit of the risk.eif- 
tailed. Besides, if anything goes 
wrong with the operation — you 
and your friend would join me in 
the Gardens of Allah.” 
“Nonsense,” said Felsen sooth- 
ingly. “Dr. Duckworth is too great 
a scientist for any such slips to 
occur. And who knows, we may 
have the answer to upheavals the 
world over. Think of it, Duck- 
worth. You will personally usher 
in a new period of tranquillity. 
And if you’re still wavering — let 
me point out that we have the most 
up-to-date, fully equipped torture 
chamber in the Near East.” 

I turned to Duckworth. 

“What do we do?” 

“We have no choice,” he said 
glumly. _ 

I was disappointed in my friend 
but I knew the extreme pressure he 
was undergoing. 



51 




“Okay then/’ I said. “I’ll help 
you. But only because I’m a cow- 
ard.” 

At these words he clapped his 
hands and an exquisite coffee li- 
queur was brought forward by a 
turbaned lackey. Handcut emer- 
ald goblets were filled and passed 
around. 

“To my people,” said the Nazir, 
his voice throbbing. 

We all drank somberly to the 
health of that harassed population. 

T WO of the world’s finest neu- 
rosurgeons were flown in and 
teaching seminars were scheduled 
with Duckworth. My friend spent 
considerable time in briefing them 
on the special skills and problems 
involved in the implanting and on 
the absolute necessity for sobriety. 
As expected, the first operation 
was to be carried out on the revo- 
lutionary. Then, if all went well, 
the Nazir would risk his royal 
head. 

Despite careful and intense 
preparation* the first operation 
was touch and go. Once Duck- 
worth became enraged and threat- 
ened to take a scalpel to the skull 
of one of the surgeons. The offer 
seemed to have a salutary effect in 
bracing the man’s nerve and the 
implanting was finally and suc- 
cessfully concluded. 

Ten days later, when the healing 
process was almost completed and 
no neurophysiological damage was 



apparent, the Nazir took a deep 
breath and went under the knife. 
This time, to my intense relief, 
the performance went more 
smoothly. When the Nazir had 
completely recovered we ~ were 
promptly summoned to his royal 
chambers. 

“I feel absolutely in the pink, 
Duckworth,” he said. “I’m ready 
to proceed.” 

Duckworth bowed: 

“So are we,” he said quietly. 
“However, it would be danger- 
ous to start prematurely. I’d like 
to carry out tests on both of you 
to make sure that the implants are 
receiving and transmitting proper- 
ly.” 

The Nazir insisted, purely as a 
precaution, on his first recording 
being taken that night at the har- 
em. 

“In the morning,” he added, 
“you can record my reactions to 
the rigors of the job.” 

Even Duckworth was startled at 
the superb quality of the recordings 
and the very low noise level. 

The following day he repeated 
his tests on the captive revolution- 
ary with equal success. Felsen hov- 
ered about all the time, ostensibly 
to satisfy his curiosity but in ac- 
tuality to keep an eye on us. Th? 
Nazir, however, was impatient 
with all the delays. 

“I want the recordings played 
back on this fellow,” he said. “And 
at once. When we are satisfied that 
they have taken hold he wjll be in- 



52 



IF 




terviewed on our national televi- 
sion network and then released.” 

T HE playbacks were run off 
without a hitch. The rebel 
leader was carefully interrogated 
by the Nazir’s psychiatric staff. 

“This man really believes,” 
they chorused. “He is not sham- 
ming.” ; 

_ And indeed, on the Waddam 
TV network, he articulated his to- 
tal empathy for what the Nazir 
went through daily in governing 
the country. He expatiated at 
great length on the mind-boggling 
problems of administering this lit- 
tle oil-soaked country. Duckworth 
was sitting off to one side, ouit of 
sight of the camera. 

“Then you wouldn’t change 
places with the Nazir?” he called 
out. 

The revolutionary sprang to his 
feet. 

“You bet I would!” he cried. 
“For the kind of harem the Nazir 
has — anything would be bear- 
able.” 

■ < 

L ATER, when the man had 
been cut off the air, Duck- 
worth and I were placed in the 
same dungeon. 

“What happened out there?” I 
asked. “I can’t understand it.” 

“I played two recordings se- 
quentially,” said Duckworth. 
“The first, under the guise of test 
runs, was a playback of the Na- 
zir’s night at the harem. The sec- 



ond was the administrative morn- 
ing at the royal desk.” 

“I’m proud of you,” I said. 
“But it may mean curtains for 

us.” 

“No it won’t,” snapped Duck- 
worth. “The Nazir is a proud 
man and the last thing he’d want 
is publicity on this qiatter. He’ll 
let us go if we pledge secrecy.” 

“And our generous consultation 
fees?” 

“Don’t push things too far,” 
said Duckworth. 

And we didn’t. Back in the 
States I was tempted to initiate a 
whopper of a lawsuit but I held 
down my baser instincts. Duck- 
worth was less restrained. I 
barged into his office and found 
him in the act of studying the 
university major medical con- 
tract. 

“Anything wrong?” I said. 

“Not yet,” said Duckworth 
noncommittally. 

“Are you contemplating • sur- 
gery?” 

Duckworth sighed. 

“I haven’t yet made up my 
mind,’’ he said. 

He pulled out a desk drawer 
and removed a five-inch reel of 
magnetic tape. 

“The harem recording of the 
Nazir,” he said wistfully. 

We looked into each other’s 
eyes for a meaningful moment. I 
coughed. 

“How extensive is our cover- 
age?” I asked. •

RON GOULART 



Prez was more than human. 
He could even be inhuman! 



T he lovely blonde threw her pa- 
per dress into the deep fire- 
place and stood back, watching 
it burn, her slender hands hooked 
under trim buttocks. 

“That’s cozy, isn’t it?” she said 
over her shoulder. “There’s some- 
thing especially pleasant about 



54 




clothes burning on a chill winter 
day, isn’t there?” 

She spun, bounded over the 
thick white rug and grabbed up 
the trousers Norbert Penner had 
just dropped. These she bundled 
and heaved into the flames. 

“Hey, Benny,” said Penner, 
half out of his all-season under- 
wear. “Those aren’t paper.” 

The girl shrugged. 

“You’re not abandoned enough, 
Norby. No, don’t frown. I love 
you. But I bet you’re thinking of 
what that pair of pants cost.” 
“Fifty-two dollars.” 

Penner was a tall lanky young 
man, just twenty eight years old, 
with hair colored like sand and a 
slight gap between his upper front 
teeth. 

Benny held her hands to the 
fire. “Relax, relax.” 

“They’re going to smoke.” Pen- 
ner was out of his underwear. He 
kicked it carefully into a safe cor- 
ner of the big beam-ceiling room. 
“Burning trousers smoke like the 
devil.” 

“You worry too much, Norby,” 
said the girl. “You’re my guest, 
aren’t you? We have this whole 
sixteen-room, three-bath house 
entirely to ourselves. We have 
ninety-six acres of beautiful early- 
winter, rural Connecticut out- 
side. You can stay here from now 
till spring. Relax. Thousands of 
people come hundreds of miles 
just to spend a few days in New 
England.” 



“They don’t get their pants set 
on fire.” 

“You never know. All people 
aren’t as conservative as you are.” 

She coughed quietly as smutty 
smoke came rolling slowly out of 
the white stone fireplace. 

“See?” 

Penner wandered over to a box 
window and looked out at the roll- 
ing grounds. 

Benny said, “I have the notion 
you don’t really love me at all, 
Norby. I don’t think you want to 
make love to me right now, even. 
You aren’t in the mood, are you?” 

“1 was until you set my pants 
on fire.” 

“That’s an excuse, isn’t it?” She 
held out her arms, a gesture he 
caught out of the corner of his eye. 
“Let’s forget the fire incident, 
Norby. Come here now, won’t 
you?” 

Penner watched a maple leaf 
spin to the ground. He turned 
around and walked to the girl. 

“You’re beautiful.” 

“Yes. Thank you,” answered 
Benny, catching him with one 
hand around the neck and one on 
his left side ribs. “But really my 
physical body is not half as beau- 
tiful as my inner being.” She 
rested her head on his bare chest. 
“One’s inner being is what counts, 
don’t you think?” 

“Urn.” 

“That’s how Defrocked Bishop 
Dix puts it in Spirit Mediator — 
Talking To The Departed In The

Technological Age. I’m aware you 
don’t completely agree with De- 
frocked Bishop Dix but you must 
see it’s one’s inner being that 
counts most. Don’t you think?” 

‘‘I think,” said Pehner, gently 
backing her toward a zebra- 
striped couch, “there are times to 
talk and times to shut up.” He 
gently swung the now silent Benny 
off her feet and placed her on the 
long couch. He kneeled on the 
soft rug, bent and kissed her 
right hand, which was peaked 
over her navel. “Benny,” he said. 

A wet nose pressed into his 
right buttock. Hot breath fol- 
lowed. 

“Where’d you hide the chow, 
peckerwood?” 

Penner bounded upward, spin- 
ning in the air, landing facing the 
dog. 

“Go away — shoo.” 

The dog, a medium-size and 
sha ggy black mutt, snorted. 

“Never mind, peckerwood: 
Benny,' there’s no food for me in 
the kitchen. The robot dispenser 
just rattles and retches when I 
push the chow button. Somebody 
forget to load the machine.” 

The- dog’s blue-red tongue 
flapped and he panted. 

Benny sat up and stroked the 
old dog’s head. 

“Now, Prez, didn’t we tell you 
not to barge in.” 

“The door was open,” said the 
dog. His left eye flared for an in- 
stant. It was made of vinyl. “1 



respect privacy, even that of 
peckerwoods. The door, however, 
was open.” 

Penner grunted suddenly, 
hopped, kicked the side of the dog. 
The animal made a clunking 
sound and Penner howled. 

“Ow — ow — ” 

“You kicked his metal side,” 
said Benny. “Come on. Let’s not 
have my two favorite people 
squabble.” 

“He’s not a person,” said 
Penner. “He’s a mongrel dog.” 

“Peckerwood,” said Prez. 

“I’ll kick the live side of your 
tail in a minute,” said Penner! He 
grimaced, went and found his 
underwear. “You freak of sci- 
ence.” 

Prez licked Benny’s knee. 

“How much longer you going to 
be v Benny.” 

T HE girl smiled down at the 
old dog. 

“Prez, you trot back to your 
nice rumpus room and we’ll feed 
you soon;’ 1 - 

“Don’t patronize me,” the dog 
told her. “You and your folks 
helped turn me into a modern mir- 
acle. You financed it. I’m as 
bright as the average ten-year-old 
boy now.” 

“Miracle,” said Penner, stomp- 
ing back into his clothes. “Every 
other bored matron down in West- 
port has a cybernetic poodle. Sen- 
timental. Instead of letting the 
damn animals die of old age they

replace their old parts with syn- 
thetics.” 

‘‘You’d like to turn me over to 
a vivisectionist,” said the dog, 
showing its teeth. Half of them 
were plastic. 

‘‘A scrap yard.” 

‘‘At least I earn my keep. I’m 
not some unemployed freeloader.” 
“Listen, I worked six damn 
years in Manhattan,” Penner 
shouted at the shaggy dog. “I was 
editor-in-chief of Barrium & Sons 
for four of those damn years. I’m 
the guy who bought the Lupoff 
papers and got them in shape for 
publication. They gave old Lupoff 
the damn Nobel Prize. So now 
I’m taking some time off to find 
myself again.” 

“If you want to find yourself,” 
said the dog, “you’re looking in 
the wrong neighborhood. You’re 
out of your class, peckerwood.” 
Penner tugged on one shoe and 
limped over to kick Prez. The old 
dog yelped. Penner said, “Damn 
it, Benny. Why did you have to 
have him fixed to talk?” 

“It only cost five thousand ex- 
tra,” said Benny. “When they put 
in the vinyl larynx Dad said we 
might as well go first cabin.” She 
smiled gently up at Penner. “Nor- 
by, relax. I’ve explained about 
Prez. It is sentimental, isn’t it? 
Still he’s been my dog since I was 
just a little girl.” - 

“Two years and three months 
old,” said Prez. “Cute as a bug’s 
rear you were.” 



“We can certainly afford to 
have him maintained,” said Ben- 
ny. “Imagine, Norby. Prez is well 
past twenty and he’s healthier and 
brighter than he ever was. And 
I’ve had him for over twenty 
years. Ever since — ” 

“August, nineteen-eighty-sev- 
en,” said the dog. “And I’m go- 
ing to live a long time beyond this 
decade. I’m even going to be 
around in the twenty-twenties, 
peckerwood.” 

“Even three years is a long 
time.” 

Penner put on his other shoe 
and sat down in a black leather 
lounging chair. 

“Is that a threat?” asked the 
dog. “I know you’d like to do me 
in, peckerwood.” 

Benny said, “Relax, Prez,” 

The dog flicked his short tail. 
Music box music began coming 
out of him, a gentle lullaby. “Re- 
member this, Benny?” 

“Of course.” She patted the 
dog, smiled across at Penner. “He 
has two thousand music tapes, 
miniaturized, built into his stom- 
ach.” 

“I know,” said Penner. 

“They named me after the 
noted jazz man, Lester Young,” 
said the dog. “His nickname was 
Prez, short for the President. Be- 
cause he was the best of the saxo- 
phone players of his day, musicians 
agreed.” 

Benny lifted the dog and car- 
ried him to the doorway. He was

pjaying One O'clock Jump when 
she set him out on the parquet. 

S NOW began to fall while Pen- 
ner was a quarter of a mile 
from the rambling two-story house 
the next morning. He was leaning 
against the mail-box pole, watch- 
ing the sky. The air suddenly 
clicked colder and flakes of snow 
hit his cheeks. The US Mai} ’cop- 
ter sounded at the same time and 
Penner spotted it, rising up from 
the Pfeiffer estate a half-mile 
down the country road. The road 
was called Maitjand-Scott Lane, 
named for Benny’s great-grandfa- 
ther, the one who had founded 
the family woolen mills. The ’cop- 
ter whirred nearer and dropped, 
hovering. 

When it was a hundred feet 
above Penner’ s head a ten-year- 
old boy in a, jumpsuit climbed 
down out of it on a dangling rope 
ladder. 

“Twenty-six cents postage due,” 
said the boy. 

“Who’s the package for?” 

“Prez, as usu4l.” 

“We don’t want it.” 

“But it’s fragile, it says. All the 
way from Algiers.” The boy came 
down the ladder, dropped to the 
ground. He held the small pack- 
age in one hand, a bundle of let- 
ters in the other. “That Prez sure 
has a lot of pen pals. My dad, you 
know Floyd Dell up in the ship, 
he says all the time Prez is sure 
some dog. To have all these pen 



friends around the world. I wrote 
to a kid in Newfoundland last 
year but nothing came of it.” 

Penner took the letters. 

“Send that other thing back to 
Algiers.” 

“We’re obliged to deliver it.” 

“Oh, okay.” 

Penner hooked a finger into his 
change pocket and gave the boy 
some coins. The boy turned over 
the package and caught the swing- 
ing ladder. 

“This snow. We just recently 
moved here from California. This 
is snow all right. I never saw any 
except in books. My father says 
we’re going back to California 
even if it is full of goofs. He for- 
got it was so cold in Connecticut. 
How do you feel. You’re a strang- 
er, too?” 

“New York isn’t that much dif- 
ferent.” 

He gave the. boy’s left foot a 
boost. 

The postman hung his head out 
of the cabin. 

“That’s some screwball dog you 
folks have. I’ve dealt with weird- 
ies from coast to coast and expe- 
rienced a lot of webfoots and 
goofs, but your dog there he must 
be the prince of the screwballs. 
What’s he write to 1 all these peo- 
ple about?” 

‘‘Jazz.” 

“Jazz? Oh, sure, I remember 
that. Black people used to play it 
back a half-century ago.” 

Penner nodded and started

IF 




back toward the house. He was 
soon among trees — the grounds 
were thick with maples and pines. 
The snow was coming straight 
now, faster. He casually flipped 
the Algiers package off into the 
brush. A bluejay looked up from 
a sparse branch. 

A slim bare arm extended from 
the partly open front door as he 
approached. 

“Here, warm up.” 

Penner took the hot rum drink 
from Benny, dropped the mail on 
a metal-legged hall table. 

“Why are you naked?” 

“Don’t be always so inquisi- 
tive.” 

“You were clothed at break- 
fast, as I recall.” 

“Well,” said the girl, undoing 
the scarlet ribbon in her hair. “I 
have to leave in an hour and I 
thought to spend my last hour 
with you, Norby. Romantically.” 
“Leaving?” 

“I got a call from Dad.” 

“Your father?” 

“That’s him. We call him Dad. 
A sentimental touch.” 

“I meant, what does he have to 
do with your leaving?” 

“He’s in Switzerland.” 

“Yes, I know that, too. Which 
is why we have your whole place 
here to ourselves for the next six 
months.” 

“A small emergency has come 
up,” said Benny. “I have to pick 
up something in Amsterdam and 
take it to him in Switzerland.” 



“You want to go alone?” 

Benny bit her lower lip, shook 
her head. “It’s that I have to, 
Norby. Some of Dad’s business 
ventures have to be carried on 
very quietly. I’ll only be three or 
four days. I’m booked on a robot 
jet out of Kennedy II at five this 
afternoon.” , . 

“Yoii already made a reserva- 
tion?” 

“While I was taking off my 
clothes. Come on, finish your 
drink. We’ll make love.” 

. Penner set the mug aside. 

“It started snowing.” 

“We’ll make love inside then.” • 
“I was only commenting on the 
weather, not complaining.” 

He toqk her by the shoulders. 
Prez said from the other end of 
the hall, “Where’s the mail, peck,- 
erwood?” 

“Right here.” He released the 
girl, snatched up letters, ap- 
* proached Prez. “Now you get in- 
to the kitchen or the rumpus room 
and attend to your mail. Don’t 
bother us for an hour or I’ll do 
something evil to you.” 

“You’re more open about your 
threats these days but I’ve sus- 
pected you for a long while,” said 
the dog. “Right now, though, I 
just want to take care of my jazz- 
buff friends. Any packages?” 

“No.” 

“Overdue. I’m expecting sever- 
al. I’ll have to call those pecker- 
woods at the post office.” 

“Yes, do. They all like you.”

Penner returned to Benny and 
locked her up with him in the sec- 
ond downstairs guest room. 



T HE dining room was fully au- 
tomatic. Alone at the head of 
the long, white-covered table Pen- 
ner fussed with the control but- 
tons. He got the six candles to 
flame, then poked the aperitif 
button. A slot at his Jeft hand slid 
open and a dubonnet jogged up. 
Sipping it, Penner flicked on the 
menu screen that was mounted on 
the wall. ' 

Prez hopped into the chair next 
to Penner. 

“Order some lean read meat,” 
he suggested. 

“Back to your Quarters.” 
“Relax, peckerwood. You heard 
what Benny said as she left. 
You’re to look after the house 
and old Prez. So be nice.” 

“You’re not allowed on the 
chairs.” 

“Okay, okay.” ' The shaggy 
black dog hopped to the floor, 
wagging his tail: “Order the 
chow.” 

“Nope. You go back to where 
you belong. I’ll bring you some 
scraps later.” 

Prez woofed disdainfully. 

“You ought to go back where 
you belong. Brooklyn Heights, 
wasn’t it? Your idea of class.” 
Penner didn’t reply. 

“Nothing like this. Not on the 
salary Barnum & Sons paid.” 



“I made twenty-five thousand 
a year.” 

“Twenty thousand,” said the 
dog. “I checked.” 

“Oh? How?” 

“I have ways. I keep in touch.” 
Prez sat on the hardwood, hit 
at his flank. 

“Fleas?” 

“No; my wiring is itching. This 
damn weather makes your wiring 
itch. Remember that when you 
get old and they start turning you 
into a cyborg.” 

“Too bad you’re sensitive to 
Cold, Prez.” 

The dog rolled over and rubbed 
his shoulders into the smooth 
flooring. 

“I phoned the post-office and 
they insist they delivered one of 
my lost packages, peckerwood.” 
“Say, that’s right. I forgot to 
mention it,” said Penner. “I 
dropped a littTe package out in the 
woods. I had my mind elsewhere.” 
“You dropped it whereabouts?” 
“Ten feet or so from that old 
pump.” 

“You can go fetch it now and 
we’ll call it even.” 

“Come off it, Prez. We’re just 
the two of us now. You go.” 

The -dog rocked on its back a 
few times, growling in his chest. 

“Okay, I’ll go because I’m very 
anxious about my package. By 
the pump?” 

“Yes, to your left as you go to- 
ward the front gate.” 

Prez trotted into the hall. Pen-

ner followed, held the front door 
open. The dog headed into the 
heavy falling snow. The grounds 
were two feet thick with new snow 
and Prez sank in and left dark 
holes as he went. 

Penner slammed the front door, 
locked it. He ran through the rest 
of the house, locked doors, acti- 
vated alt the electric window locks 
and burglar bolts. 

In the dining room he ordered 
a curry dinner. 

The first thing Prez did was 
scratch at the front door, then the 
back v .He barked, howled, shouted 
insults. Gale winds rose a little af- 
ter ten and the sounds of the an- 
gry dog were muffled and lost. - 

By the time Penner went to bed 
the snow was coming in blizzard 
strength. There was no sound at 
all from Prez. 

T HE breakfast-table radio said, 
“Present reports indicate all 
aboard the. Swiss-bound New 
World Airlines autosonic super- 
jet were lost when it went down in 
the storm-tossed Atlantic. Among 
those listed as passengers on the 
NWA flight were Asmund Crow- 
den, the well-known investment 
broker, singer Merlo Benninger 
and Benny Maitland-Scott, lovely 
country-hopping daughter of the 
woolens tycoon . 

Penner put down his coffee cup. 
He swooped an arm across the ta- 
ble and twisted up the volume. 

The radio said, “Also said to be 



on the flight was former light- 
heavyweight champ. Kid . 

There was a crackling and the 
sound died. 

Penner hit the speaker grid with 
the heel of his hand. The little ra- 
dio snapped, dislodged from its 
position on the table and fell. Pen- 
ner ran to the living room and got 
the entertainment system warmed 
up. He flicked a toggle in the wall 
panel and the wall-size TV screen 
came alive. 

“This is a cockatoo, of course, 
boys and girls,” explained the 
plump man in the scarlet band 
uniform and curly red wig. “Isn’t 
he handsome, Mr. Crackerjack- 
er?” 

“I’ll say. Cap. Oops, he nipped 
a little chunk out of your thumb.” 

“Son of a bitch,” said the cap- 
tain. 

Penner hit at another switch. 
The Secretary of Defense ap- 
peared. 

“I think we can level with each 
other, gentlemen. I have great re- 
spect for your committee and I 
say to you now in all honesty that 
we wouldn’t drop anything like 
that on civilians.” 

On the next station a Black 
man in a smock said, “Hello, 
Rick. Martin here with the weath- 
er picture. As you can see by the 
map our computer is drawing for

big one in nineteen-seventy-one.” 
Behind Penner a voice asked, 
“What’s the excitement?” 
“Prez—” 

The floppy black dog was lol- 
ling in a flowered loveseat, 

“No hard feelings,” said the 
dog, scratching at his ear with his 
hind foot. “I guess you simply 
didn’t realize I got locked out last 
night. You sure couldn’t have 
heard my howling with the storm 
raging.” 

“How’d you get in?” 

“I know a few tricks, Electron- 
ics tricks, simple lock-picking,” 
the dog told him. “You look un- 
settled.” 

Penner said, “The news. The 
news just said Benny’s robot jet 
crashed.” 

Prez made an anguished whin- 
ing sound. 

“Benny? No. Are you sure she 
was on the plane?” 

“Yes — they gave her name.” 
“There could be a mistake.” 
“You’re right, Prez. I’ll call the 
damn airline.” He strode to the 
phone on the round marble coffee 
table. He picked up the receiver. 
“Damn it.” 

“What?” 

“Line’s dead.” 

“Happens during these bliz- 
zards. This isn’t Manhattan or 
even the suburbs. Everything isn’t 
underground yet in this neck of 
the woods. Trees fall over and dis- 
rupt the phone service.” 

Penner was in the hall. That 



phone was dead, too. He went 
through the big house and 
checked all the phones. He re- 
turned to the hall and snatched 
open the closet. He had his hand 
on a plaid neck scarf when Benny 
called to him. 

“Norby. Norby, darling, where 
are you?” — 

Walking backward three steps, 
his fingers trailing the woolen 
scarf, Penner said carefully, “Ben- 
ny?” 

“Can you hear me? Oh, Norby, 
can you hear me across such a 
distance?” 

She seemed to be in the living 
room. Penner stepped there. 

“Benny, where are you?” 

“I’m not sure, Norby. This is 
all very strange, isn’t it? What a 
pleasant surprise, though, to dis- 
cover that Defrocked Bishop Dix 
is right,” 

Her voice was coming from the 
dog. 

Penner’s arms involuntarily 
rose and his hands flapped faint- 
ly. He dropped the scarf, began 
breathing through his mouth. 

“Benny, how in the hell did you 
get inside that damn dog?” 

Prez’s eyes were' tightly closed 
and his mouth was barely open. 

“I’m in the — well — what De- 
frocked Bishop Dix calls the 
Other Reality, Norby.” 

“Didn’t you go to Switzerland?” 

“Oh, Norby, darling, you are 
slow on the uptake, aren’t you? 
Norby, I’m dead.”

IF 




“Dead? No—” 

‘‘Yes. I’m here in the Other Re- 
ality now. But I can still talk to 
you sometimes. That’ll be nice, 
won’t it?” 

Penner blinked, shook his head, 
gingerly picked up the dog. 

“Benny, what are you saying?” 

“I’m communicating with you 
from over here, Norby, through 
the spirit media. Don’t ask me 
how or why, darling, but the best 
medium for communicating with 
you seems to be poor old Prez’ 
electronic parts.” 

“Yes, but,” said Penner. 

“Please stay there so I can talk 
to you, Norby. It’s so strange here 
and I don’t know anybody yet. 
Except for some of the people 
from the plane. You stay at the 
house until Dad can do some- 
thing. And, Norby, I guess it’s 
safe to tell you now I’ve men- 
tioned you in my will.” 

Penner was face to face with the 
old dog. 

“What’s a girl twenty-two need 
a will for?” 

“It came in handy, didn’t it? 
Now that I’m deceased and all. I 
just want you to know you’ll be 
provided for. You and poor dear 
Prez.” 

“I don’t want to talk about that 
now, Benny.” 

“A half-million is all I could 
manage on my own for you, Nor- 
by. Is that going to be okay?” 

Penner dropped the dog. 

“A half a million dollars?” 



Prez said, “Ouch. What’s the 
idea, peckerwood?” 

“Benny,” called Penner. 

“Are you getting unsettled some 
more?’* Prez asked. 

“Benny was just now talking to 
me. Through you, Prez. Didn’t 
you hear it?” 

“No.” The dog jumped back up 
on the loveseat and arranged him- 
self. “That’s sort of marvelous in 
a way. Bishop Dix turns out to’ve 
been right, huh?” 

“Bishop Dix. Defrocked Bishop 
Dix. He left the church.” 

“I guess you’d have to with all 
those wacky ideas.” 

“But it works, Prez. Benny can 
talk to me from — wherever she 
is.” 

The shaggy black dog scratched 
its ear. 

“I think I’ll go out and sniff 
around in the woods.” 

Penner said, “No. You stay 
right here.” 

“I have to go to the john,” the 
dog said. 

“I’ll fix you up something in 
the rumpus room. You have to 
stay indoors. I don’t want to risk 
you out in a blizzard. Benny will 
keep trying to get through.” 

“Okay, I’ll cooperate.” The dog 
sniffed. “I’m hungry. Do you re- 
call the lean red meat I alluded to 
last evening?” 

“Sure, I’ll get you a nice little 
steak and put it out in your dish.” 
“A big steak, peckerwood. And 
right here is where I’ll eat it.”

Penner said after a moment,, 
“Okay, Prez.” 

L OOKING away from the elec- 
tric typewriter, Penner 
watched the swirling snow outside 
the conservatory windows. The 
snow was four feet high and the 
wind roared and whooped. 

“I thought you had a special 
dictating machine for your corre- 
spondence,” he said to Prez. 

Prez was on a white leather 
sofa chair, worrying a steak bone. 

He paused to say, “I’m not in 
the mood for that. It’s more fun 
to dictate to you. Benny would 
help me out once in a while, too. 
Great fun on stormy days. Now 
get typing.” 

“A lot of fun — being private 
secretary to a mongrel dog,” said 
Penner. 

“What’s that, peckerwood?” 
“Nothing.” Penner had talked 
to Benny twice more since that 
first time yesterday. He’d decided 
it was worth putting up with Prez 
if he could keep in contact with 
the girl. “Go ahead.” 

“Where was I?” 

“ ‘The. sidemen on that particu- 
lar session, my dear Derik, were 
Dicky Wells, Benny Carter, Way- 
man Carver, Leon “Chu” Berry 
. .’ How many of these guys do 
you write to, Prez?” 

“More than' a hundred.” The 
dog repositioned the bone with 
both front paws. “I’m in t,ouch 
with more than a hundred jazz 



buffs through out the world. We 
exchange letters, records, .tapes 
and other, sometimes exotip, mem- 
orabilia.” 

“Exotic?” 

“The postal system is often very 
lax. We swap a few pills, a pinch 
of snuff now and then.” 

“You’re a junkie?” 

“No, I simply have a certain 
kind of scientific curiosity,” re- 
plied the dog. “Let’s get back to 
the letter at hand.” 

When Penner had typed three 
more letters and put them in en- 
velopes he said, “Enough for to- 
day.” 

“Mail them now.” 

“There’s not likely to be a pick- 
up today.” 

“The post office will be open.” 
“It’s two miles away and we’re 
still having a blizzard,” 

He dropped the three letters 
down on the closed typewriter. 

“I’m expecting a couple of 
more packages, too.” 

“I’ll go after the thaw,” the dog 
Said. 

“Today.” 

“Don’t get arrogant, Prez.” 

“I’ll go then.” 

The dog, bone in mouth, 
jumped to the floor. 

“No you don’t.” 

“Then, you.” 

Penner slowly inhaled and ex- 
haled. 

“I’ll give it a try. You stay in- 
side and if Benny tries to contact 
me, explain.”

“Get a book of twelve-cent 
stamps while you’re there.” 

Prez trotted out of the room. 

P ENNER threw himself at the 
front door of the house, stum- 
bled through it. He fell over the 
hall rug, crashed against the mail 
table on his way down, dropping 
two letters, a magazine and three 
packages. His face was frosted 
and a tingling red color. He did a 
lopsided pushup and worked to a 
sitting position. He unwound the 
cold and soggy woolen muffler 
with his stiff wool mittened fin- 
gers. ^ 

“Norby, darling? Oh, my dear- 
est, where are you?” called Ben- 
ny’s voice, 

“In a minute, in a minute,” he 
yelled back, “Hold on.” 

He grunted, tugged at his boots. 
These were slushy and dripped 
brown snow up his sleeves. He 
next rolled out of his snow coat. 

“Norby, are- you all right? 
Please talk to me. It’s growing, 
harder to reach you from over 
here. Such an effort is required.” , 
“I’m coming. I’m coming. I’ve 
got problems, too, Benny.” 

He shed the rest of his outdoor 
clothes and went weaving into the 
living room. 

PreZ was on the floor near the 
magazine bin, on his back, feet up 
in the air. 

“Norby, is something wrong?” 
“I’m okay.” Penner, squatting 

PREZv 



next to the dog, added: “Some- 
times I wish you had worked out 
a better means of communica- 
tion.” 

“I don’t have much choice. 
Listen, Norby, it would be a great 
help if you could — ” 

“Could what?” 

Prez opened his eyes. 

“Where’s the mail?” 

Penner pinned the dog down by 
his shoulders. 

“Benny, what is it you want?” 
“Let go of me,” said the dog. 
Penner did. 



T HE warm hand sat on his 
naked chest like a starfish. 
Penner sat up in the wide bed and 
said,“Yow.” 

“Norby, relax. You’re certainly 
jumpy, aren’t you?” 

Penner reeled in the lamp cord 
and found the toggle. Light came 
on and he saw Benny, in a tan 
raincoat and dark head - scarf, sit- 
- ting on the edge of the bed. 

He caught her elbow. The cloth 
' was chill, still damp with the snow- 
flakes. 

“How does Bishop Dix work 
this?” 

“What? I didn’t mean to scare 
you awake, Norby. I know you 
weren’t expecting me for several 
days. After the flight was can- 
celed I spent the night in New 
York. I called you first thing the 
next morning but the phone was 
out. So I decided to fight my way

am. 

She leaned down to kiss him. 

“Then you didn’t go down in 
the storm-tossed waters of the At- 
lantic?’’ 

“Our flight was canceled,” said 
the lovely blonde girl. “I phoned 
Dad and he said he’d make other 
arrangements. So I rented a car 
and I got stuck in Port Chester 
for the longest spell — but here I 
am.” 

Penner touched her again. 

“Benny, about Prez?” 

“Is he well? The cold bothers 
him sometimes.” 

“He’s fine. Can he change his 
voice at all. That is, have you ever 
known him to do something like 
that?” 

Benny laughed. 

“Has he been teasing you. Yes, 
he’s very good at impersonations. 
We had that built in.” 

Penner said, “You stay here. 
I’ll be back in a few minutes. A 
last-minute something I thought 
of.” 

“Can’t it wait?” 

“No.” 

“I’ll take off my clothes.” 

“Do that,” he said. 

Penner grabbed a robe and 
shuffled into slippers. He shot out 
of the bedroom and down the 
stairs. Prez was gone from the 
loveseat he had selected to sleep 
on. Penner chose the heaviest 



poker from the rack of them 
screwed to the fireplace bricks. He 
roamed the dark house and lo- 
cated the shaggy black dog under 
an old desk in the rumpus room. 

“Come out of there, you stink- 
er.” 

The dog huddled in a nest of 
torn package wrappings. A Swed- 
ish stamp had gotten stuck to his 
floppy left ear. 

“What is it now, peckerwood?” 

Penner said, “We’ve sure had a 
lot of fun. You and your damn 
hoax. Well, as you must know, 
Benny’s back. I’m going to run 
things.” 

“That’ll be a switch.” 

Penner thrust his free hand un- 
der the desk and caught at Prez. 

“Watch it—” 

Prez snarled, then bit Penner’s 
hand. 

“Damn.” Penner pulled his 
bleeding hand free. “Now you’re 
really through, Prez.” 

“Oh, no,” said the dog. “You 
are.” 

“What?” 

“You’ve just been infected with 
rabies.” 

Penner looked from his injured 
hand to the dog under the desk. 

“No more jokes, Prez. I happen 
to know there hasn’t been a case 
of rabies in this part of the coun- 
try for ten years.” 

“I know,” said the dog. “That’s 
why I had to send away for the 
virus.” •

C. M. DRAHAN 

Which is better— to understand 
an alien or to know yourself ? 



T HE captain picked up one of 
the cubes and very carefully 
felt it between his thumb and fore- 
finger. His eyes held suspicion. 
“What is it?” 

“A bomb.” 

He stared at it. 

Jerod answered the unspoken 



comment: “No — not like any 

bomb you’ve ever seen. ’Specially 
constructed for our purpose. The 
explosive is inside under pres- 
sure.” 

The captain put the blue-black 
cube down beside its twin. They 
lay together on the desk between 



67 



the two men reduced now to 
brooding silence. The captain’s 
eyes were on the cubes. 

“When?” 

Jerod understood. 

“Departure is scheduled for as 
soon as the Telepath arrives. The 
rest is set. Your ship is ready?” 
“Yes.” The captain raised his 
eyes to Jerod’ s. The sharp lines of 
his face softened. “I won’t be 
needing the replacement person^ 
nel. The entire crew is staying 
on.” Pride echoed in his words. 
“We’ve been together a long time 
— since before the War. It’s—” 
He stumbled-tongued, looking 
perhaps for a word to describe his 
feelings. Lamely he finished: “It’s 
too late now anyway.” t 
The door slid open onto re- 
newed silence. The intruder’s face 
wore an indoor pallor. His uni- 
form was wrinkled. His eyes were 
hollow, with harsh shadows be- 
neath them. 

Jerod: “That’s all for now, I 
guess.” 

The captain turned to leave. 
“Wait — ” Jerod removed a 
cube. He never consciously 
thought of it as a bomb — it was 
ridiculously small for the power 
the word implied. “You might as 
well take it with you.” 

He handed the captain the 
cube. The captain pushed it into 
a side pocket without looking at 
it. The newcomer’s eyes followed 
him out past the door. 

Jerod asked, “Well, Hayes?” 



“The Telepath? He’s as ready 
as he’ll ever be.” 

Hayes spoke in a monotone. 
“You’re sure?” 

“Yes, damn it! Does it make 
any difference?” 

Jerod stared at him quizzically. 
“Any thing wrong?” 

“No. Should there be?” The 
pale, rumpled man looked 
doomed. His whole appearance 
whispered it. “You want to see 
the Telepath before the Double 
Bill leaves?” 

“No.” Jerod spoke softly. “No. 
It isn’t necessary.” 

O N THE truce planetoid, Stet- 
son-Mirrada, the E-tee was 
waiting. 

He was tall and somber with 
hair the color of thunderclouds. 
Both his hands gripped tightly the 
guide bar of his vehicle as it 
drifted fifty meters above the sur- 
face of the designated meeting 
place. 

An impressive array of devices 
protected the alien. Hte craft con- 
tained a variety of them and he 
himself carried no less than a doz- 
en weapons. A stunner at his side 
was the only one visible. It was 
within the terms of the meeting — 
and was meant to lull the Other’s 
suspicions. 

v Yet fear prowled the alien’s 
mind beneath the thin layers of 
superimposed logic called “civili- 
zation” — a terror almost primor- 
dial — although, as a precaution

IF 




against treachery by the Enemy, 
his mother ship waited. She was 
standing off a standard astronom- 
ical unit from the planetoid, ac- 
cording to the agreement reached 
with the Enemy. She was also 
secretly modified to enable her to 
get to him faster and with more 
fire-power than her Enemy coun- 
terpart. Yet the feeling remained 
tacit despite all the logical rea- 
sons arrayed against it. 

The Enemy’s cyborg scout ship 
grew within his lidless, violet eyes. 
His hands on the guide bar of the 
floater clenched into fists. 

HE Telepath awoke. 

He fought upward from a re- 
membered nightmare* to the cool- 
ness of silence. Stubborn pieces of 
the dream swirled within the stark 
flood of his drugged brain like 
pinpricks setting it afire with pain. 
An insanely multiplying torment 
of billions of animals whimpering 
in the jungles of night was tearing 
him apart. 

He trembled on the brink of 
relevance. 

Steady . You'll be all right now. 
We're here to help you. 

Screams echoed through his 
mind. 

Hurry with that hypo . 

He jammed the back of his 
hand against his mouth to stifle 
the terror rising to his, lips. 

It's all right . gone now . 
finished ... 

His breathing steadied and he 



managed to relax the contorted 
muscles of his face, to drive away 
ther hunted look. He stared into 
the view-screen, watching the 
planetoid swallow the ship. 

Silence . genuine . real . 
with no blurred undertone run - 
ning beneath it . so cool . 

He tasted it within himself r- 

You understand what's to be 
done ... 

Terror rumbled. 

Yes. Yes. I understand . Give 
me the drug. The encephalic de- 
pressant. Give it tome .. 

W ITH a conscious effort the 
E-tee kept his face impas- 
sive. But he could not control the v 
turbulence under his imposed 
calm. 

The Enemy was descending 
from a circular opening at the 
base of his cyborg ship. He 
dropped slowly to the E- tee’s lev- 
el. 

The uneasiness kindled higher, 
racing along hi^ nerves, within, his 
blood, until he could barely keep 
from baring his teeth at the crea- 
ture. His hands were fists about 
the guide bar, the ram-fire nee- 
djer hidden in it seeming as far 
away as his home world. 

They faced each other sepa- 
rated by five meters of distance. 

Hiding the throbbing within him 
the E-tee spoke: “I am empow- 
ered to discuss terms of settle- 
ment.” . 

The movement of his lips re-

vealed small, concavely serrated 
teeth. 

He memorized every detail of 
the Enemy. The sensors here as 
well as those watching from the 
mother ship might miss something 
and every bit of information 
would be vital in order to discov- 
er the location of the Enemy home 
world. 

The- Enemy winced as if slapped 
across the face. The action puzr 
zled the E-tee. His face was still a 
blank. It had not betrayed him. 

It came . 

. again. 

A wave of nausea knotted his 
stomach. 

Fight it! Fight it, damn you! 

Well r... 

Couldn't take it. He's uncon- 
scious. His mind is still receiving, 
- though . Ill have to give him the

And again. As long as it

Wouldn't it be kinder to put 
him out of his pain? 

For whom? 

Remembering . slashed 
across its belly ... died shriek- 
ing. Irrelevant. His mind was 
drowning in a flickering kaleido- 
scope of flame dripping molten 
fire like a huge festering sore. He 
was mute, the screams trapped in 
his mouth, incapable of escaping 



the scouring tumult of images and 
alien emotions. He'reeled with the 
superimposed pounding in his 
blood at the sounding din of a 
million strange trumpets playing 
a berserk dirge over the gutted 
carcasses of burning cities; weav- 
ing within, improvising upon, the 
weakening groans of the dying and 
the high, piercing screams of the 
still living. Bloated bodies ripen- 
ing to olive from green to black as 
burned-out cinders gushed at 
him. His mind stared numbly at 
hollow, grinning sockets that noth- 
ing could hurt any more and 
slipped on unwound intestines to 
lie feebly, attempting to fold in 
upon itself and escape the . 

Blood ... 

He fell under the ages of bones 
and died— and fell again. And 
then there was no more blood- 
just words blowing from some- 
where. 

Lie la, there is no other way. 
The Enemy must be destroyed. 
Llela, understand. Please, Llela— 
Llela— what L never had time to 
say to you . 

The Telepath understood. 

Must the women always wait? 
Why? For what reason? 

When you've found out the lo- 
cation of the E-tee's home world 
and any other strategic data press 
this, stud. It will release an odor-

Always the same ... the blind-

You have no choice. We have 
no choice. You have to do it. 
You re the only Telepath we T ve 
got. The other eight burned out 
within a Month of becoming ac- 
tive. You’re the last one alive and 
sane. You owe the human race 
something for that at least ... 

Don’t you think I know that? 
Sometimes I wish Polypsychic 
hadn’t brought me out of with- 
drawal. Have you any conception 
of what it is to be the means by 
which an entire race of people 
die? Can you understand that , 
Hayes? The death of— people? 

They’re not people. JE-tees. 
Aliens. Zenophobic „ monsters — 
they’re not people. And what dif- 
ference does it really make any- 
way? Who gives a damn? That’s 
the way its always been since the 
first human could lift a rock or 
swing a club to take what he 
wanted. Sure , there has to be a 
better way — sometime ; Maybe 
we’re not truly human yet. Or 



only too human . 

I kno\y. But that still doesn’t 
make it the way it has to be now. 
We have to try to change— even 
if we fail. We have to try. 

Look , just do what you’re told . 
It’s not your personal responsibil- 
ity to decide the moral value judg- 
ments ... 

But it is. Can’t you see that? 
You know , the first contact ships 
from both races didn’t even try 
to talk to each other before they 
opened fire . 

T HE words formed purposeful- 
ly in the Telepath’s mind. 
Listen to me . 

He opened his mind to the E- 
tee trying to explain what words 
could never make clear. For the 
smallest part of a heartbeat 
long war within was ended. They 
stood face to face, mind to mind. 

There was sudden comprehen- 
sion. Panic. The E-tee’s r eyes 
glazed over with unreasoning fear. 
His mind twisted, struck out. 

No — can’t you understand? Lis- 
ten. 

The E- tee’s hand plunged to- 
ward the button on the guide bar 
of his vehicle. 

No ... 

The Telepath reacted instinc- 
tively. An almost inaudible hiss 
whispered from the e-d injector. 
The E- tee’s hand stopped as if 
frozen as the gas began to work. 
Realization dawned slowly on his 
face.

In a hoarse, straining voice he 
croaked, “Telepath!” His hand 
found another, nearer, button. 

No.. 

Time shattered into twisting 
hot splinters . melting. The 

blast slammed into the Telepath 
with a buzzing steel fury. His 
floater platform jumped in the 
shock wave and fell. 

He crashed. A blossoming flow- 
er of fire exploded within him. He 
doubled over with pain into a void 
— into a rushing darkness where 
the fire did not exist. 

H E AWOKE to silence and 
the smell of dug earth. 

Using the battered floater’s rail 
he pulled himself upright. The E- 
tee’s vehicle was scattered across 
the green. Small charred pieces 
dotted it obscenely, along with 
other debris. 

Blood . always blood . 

High above, within a flashing 
of sparks, a new star glowed for a 
moment. 

I failed ... but there is no es- 
cape . there can never be .. < I 
care . that is the way it is . 
the only way it could be . 

The E-tee mother ship was 
growing rapidly larger in the sky. 

T HE pictures on the monitors 
suddenly blacked out. Hayes 
looked up from the screens. 

“The Double Bill is gone.’’ 

Jerod nodded. 

“It was supposed to happen. 



The Telepath could never have 
completed the mission. We knew 
that before we sent him. The per- 
sonality profile Polypsychic put 
together on him confirmed it. By 
now the E-tees have him. They’ll 
check him carefully and take him 
to their home world for intensive 
study.” 

Hayes didn’t understand. 

“The cubes,” Jerod said. 
“Didn’t you ever wonder why 
there were two? The explosive is 
part of his blood by now.” 

“Damn you.” 

“It had to be done. As much as 
it was hard and pitiless, it was 
justified. Mankind must survive. 
Its enemies must be destroyed. 
There is no other way.” 

Hayes glared at Jerod. 

“You used him. He never had 
any choice. Now he’s a walking 
bomb.” 

“We had no choice. We did 
what had to be done. Our sur- 
vival as a race depends on our in- 
dividual readiness to fight— and 
even die — if necessary. , He owed 
humanity that at least.” He was 
silent for a moment, the grimness 
about his mouth and eyes quiver- 
ing. His voice came deliberately 
softer: “You understand?” 

“Does it matter?” The words 
were heavy with weariness. 

Hayes reached into a pocket for 
a piece of paper one of the Poly- 
psychic doctors had given him. A 
poem the Telepath had written. 
Hayes stared at the scrawl.

smelled like a female turnip 
when male celery was desired!

BIOCHESS 



T.J. BASS 



S tarship Olga gently nosed into 
her berth at the Grus Satellite 
Station and roused her human 
companion/pilot. This would be 
their last rest stop before the long 
run down the Los Coyotes Diago- 
nal to the Dog Star. Here she 
could bargain around for fuel and 
astrogational data while Spider, 
her human, relaxed. Spider en- 
joyed biochess and the Grus S.S. 
game room had an attractive rep- 
utation. 

Spider drifted sleepily from his 



couch to the refresher. He pulled 
on his heavily telemetered under- 
suit and swam deftly from web to 
web toward the airlock. 

His half-sized left arm and 
right leg gave him a hobbling, 
spiderlike gait on a planet’s sur- 
face but in the no-grav of space he 
moved smoothly. Mechanical em- 
bryogenesis might be a handy 
method of growing babies outside 
the female’s uterus but spider’s 
servo had bungled his fetal min- 
eral balance and left him with ir- 



75 



regular bone growth — asymmetri- 
cal extremities and a lumpy skull. 
But a spaceship pilot was judged 
for his productivity and wit, not 
for his decorative value. 

The game room was dark. The 
Auto-Glo boards and pieces were 
reflected in the players’ eyes— soft 
yellows and greens. Spectators 
hung about in ‘ three-dimensional 
webs. A wall panel monitored the 
contests — Spider’s rating was up 
0.37 points after two games. His 
retinal rhodopsin was bleached 
out from concentrating on the 
glowing pieces. When his third op- 
ponent joined him out of the dark- 
ness, all he could see was a pair of 
twinkling humanoid corneas star- 
ing at him from across the board. 
Anonymity enhanced biochess by 
adding an unknown rating to un- 
predictable protoplasm. 

Spider found meck-chess too 
consistent. His depth of analysis 
depended on the machine’s set- 
ting. A move he’d give a (!) at 
2,000 might get a (?) at 1,000 be- 
cause of superfidal study. This 
error could cost him the position 
when facing a protoplasmic intel- 
ligence, whose genius fluctuated 
with metabolic variations but a 
machine could be counted on to 
play only at its rating. 

This opponent was biological 
and probably human — two eyes, 
no facets. He was Right King and 
moved first. An offered gambit 
pawn. It was declined. He opened 
a rook file opposite the castled 



Left King, forcing the N-KR3. 
The move had seemed natural 
enough in the opening— but when 
the knight remained inactive oh 
the sidelines during the midgame 
struggle for the center, Spider sus- 
pected that he was being given the 
“silent knight odds.” Why? 

He studied -the eyes again— 
large and unfamiliar. A flat, wide 
nose was visible. The head silhou- 
ette was large — either a pillow of 
human hair or the ballooned head 
of some alien. Spider recognized 
neither the features nor. the style 
of play. He pressed his attack. 

Spider’s extra working knight 
took the center. The Left King’s 
pawn line crumbled under his 
rdoks and bishops as they rolled' 
toward the castled position. End 
game deteriorated into a lively 
king hunt which attracted a clot 
of spectators. 

Spider heard someone in the 
background mumble: “He’s really 
doing it to her.” 

The pronoun explained the “si- 
lent knight odds”— a feminine 
ploy. By making her position un- 
playable she had adopted a sub- 
missive female posture on the 
chessboard. She was toying with 
him and letting her clock run. 

He checked. She fled. He 
checked again. Then— in a ges- 
ture of resignation— she placed 
her index finger on her queen and 
slowly tipped it over. The wall 
panel recorded another win for 
him. She disappeared into the

darkness as he began to set up the 
board again. Discovering that one 
of his knights was missing. Spider 
climbed the webfc and started 
floating after her. It was unusual 
to run into “horse collectors” on 
satellites. 

H E SPOTTED her on the 
deck. From a distance she 
appeared to be wearing tight, gold- 
foil coveralls. She ducked furtively 
into a cabin in the pilot section. As 
he drifted up to the door it unex- 
pectedly irised him into a single 
bunk room, containing a refresher, 
a desk and a dispenser chute. The 
roar of the layered air/water lam- 
inar flow filled his ears and he saw 
her telemetered undersuit snapped 
to the outside of the refresher 
hatch. On the desk top he found 
his knight — a dull opaque yellow 
in the cabin’s light. Two frosted 
squeeze bottles 'were conspicuous 
in the dispenser. 

“Have a foamy. I’ll be right 
out,” she shouted over the roar. 
She groped coyly around the hatch 
for her undersuit — hardly more 
than a body stocking spangled 
with small sensors and microcir- 
cuits. He sipped his drink--a co- 
gnac old-fashioned. 

“Your knight is on the— oh, I 
see you’ve found it,” she said as 
she entered the room. 

The gold-foil effect was caused 
by a heavy patina of body paint 
which gleamed brightly, through 
the wide. mesh. She was hurhan,

said conversationally as she ap- 
proached on a tangent. 

Her right hand darted out and 
cupped the back of his head. She 
gave him three quick, wet kisses 
— analytical pecks — on his mouth, 
cheek and neck. Leaving him spin- 
ning slowly in the middle of the 
room, she continued to the chute 
and picked up her drink. 

He stopped his rotation with a 
ceiling web. 

“Testing?” he asked. 

Sucking on her drink, she raised 
her eyes and nodded. 

“And?” he asked. 

She shrugged and shook her 
head. 

Nothing. That was his usual 
effect on the girls. He drifted over 
to her and gave her sternal area a 
tentative pat. 

“Frolicking with anyone to- 
night?” he asked. 

The silence that dragged" out 
hurt him but he maintained a 
pleasant, easy facade. She glanced 
from the ^refresher to her bunk — 
weighing an evening’s companion- 
ship against the coming months of 
loneliness on her deepspace route. 

“Come back after your game,” 
she said pleasantly. 

Spider returned to the game

room and lost to a Quad , a mas- 
sive alien with one large, faceted 
eye and redundant skin folds. 
Endgame recklessness cost him a 
passed pawn. 

Later he found her coaxing a 
three-course meal out of her dis- 
penser. The variety was interest- 
ing. He ate well. Preparing to frol- 
ic, she warmed the refresher and 
undid her belt. 

“You can bunk with me,” she 
invited. “But I don’t think I can 
love you.” 

They both watched her cardio- 
gram tell-tale — no tachycardia or 
extrasystoles. Snapping their 
suits to the hatch, they entered the 
steamy wind tunnel. Cascades > of 
low-ion water buffeted their inti- 
mate swim/dance.. As her. body 
paint peeled off he saw her reason 
for wearing it. Her epidermis had 
.the dull gray-black pigmentation 
of silver-ion overload — argyria— 
and a. linear, hairy, mole ran down 
the midline of her back. The ar- 
gyria was a cumulative error in 
her ship’s life-support system — 
not physiologically significant, 
amounting to merely a cosmetic 
disaster. 

They danced until their bodies 
squeaked on contact. She talked 
easily, petted politely and even 
attempted to look sultry — but she 
couldn’t^ love. They bunked to- 
gether — warmed physically and 
psychologically by each other’s 
presence. 

Twelve standard hours later 



they left Grus Station — going 
their separate routes. 

T he Los Coyotes Diagonal held 
few surprises. About two years 
later Olga returned from the Dbg 
Star and entered the Grus com- 
munication net. 

A soft throb of music attracted 
Spider’s attention to Olga’s panel. 
The viewscreen showed a horizon- 
tal drumhead festooned with flow- 
ers. His forehead dampened as a 
small, naked female approached 
the tangle of blossoms. This was 
the beginning of the Drum Dance 
— the mating ritual of his home 
planet— Deneb One. The fact 
that no 'female had ever drummed 
for him did not lessen the dance’s 
impact on his physiology. 

He wiped his brow with' his 
gnarled left hand and adjusted the 
focus. She stepped onto the resil- 
ient hide — feet wide apart — toes 
gripping the grained surface. Her 
wide eyes and slight curves sug- 
gested a pubescent innocence but 
this, quickly vanished in the wild 
erotica of her dance. 

Her long hair— at first an un- 
ruly, dry web ballooned out by 
static electricity— began to tangle 
and cling in' her beading sweat. 
Her exertion continued. Pound- 
ing heart sounds accentuated the 
musical beat as the tempo picked 
up. Trickles of salty eccrine mar- 
bled her belly and legs. Her feet 
pattered wetly to a crescendo. 

The screen blanked in mid-

•IF 




throb and Spider slowly let out the 
breath he was holding. Silence 
hung for a moment in the little 
command cabin. 

He roused himself from ' the 
demi-trance to ask, “Who was 
that?” 

“Rau Lu,” filled in Olga. The 
screen activated and showed the 
I.D. vjews of the female chess op- 
ponent — complete down to the 
mole on her back. 

Spider eyed Olga’s optic pickup 
suspiciously. 

“But Rau Lu is from Kliiborne 
—out Sirius way. She isn’t famil- 
iar with our mating rituals,” he 
said. ' 

“The dance was simulated,” 
explained Olga in a dry , metallic 
tone. 

He winced. The depth ‘of under- 
standing these machines were ac- 
quiring by living with humans 
continued to surprise him. He 
raised a quizzical eyebrow. 

“Diagnostic test,” said Olga. 
“Ever since our stopover at the 
Grus Satellite we’v£ had small in- 
efficiencies on board. Inefficien- 
cies that could cut into our prof- 
its.” 

“But I haven’t noticed any . .” 
he began. 

“It is quite obvious from these 
graphs — ” Olga projected a vari- 
ety of his physiological readouts 
on the screen^“that your red 
feathers are showing.”. 

“My red what?” he asked. 

“Your red feathers,” said Olga. 



“This tracing is your arrecteres 
pilorum myogram which measures 
the elevation of your hair shafts. 
Note the effect of the Drum 
Dance. The pattern corresponds 
quite closely with the red feather 
myogram qf the grouse during its 
mating dance.” 

Over a sawtoothed myogram 
the split-screen showed brambles 
and' dry leaves. Deneb One’s red 
ruffed grouse hopped about, beat- 
: irtg its wings. He could understand 
why the myograms might be sim- 
ilar. Just the thought of the dance 
prickled his back and neck. His 
motor end plates must drop their 
thresholds because his trapezius 
muscles seemed to tense. Capillary 
beds swelled, pulse and respira- 
tion changes occurred. He under- 
stood. 

Olga continued: “The red-feath- 
er adjustment — love metabolism 
— is efficient on a planet’s surface 
if you are competing for a mate. 
It is inefficient on a starship where 
patience and accuracy are 
needed.” 

“But I’m not in love,” he pro- 
tested. 

The throbbing music began and 
a soft focus of the flowered drum- 
head appeared on the screen. 

He held up his right hand. 

“Stop! Okay. I’ll admit that the 
Drum Dance gives me goose flesh 
— or grouse flesh. But that is non- 
specific. Rau Lu was just another 
girl in my life. I’m not in love,” 
he said firmly.

Olga detected his rising epi- 
nephrine level, so she dropped 
back into Routine Mode. A star 
map appeared on her screen. 

A T THE completion of their 
run Olga remained in orbit to 
off-load while Spider reentered. 
The pulj of gravity was irksome 
after almost eight years of pleas- 
ant weightlessness but his faithful 
gym work preserved sufficient 
muscle and bone to handle the 
effort. The eighteen-inch right leg 
prosthesis worked pretty well on 
the smooth beltways. After a few 
false starts he was able to leave 
the crutches in the tender. 

Checking in with the Company, 
he was pleasantly surprised by his 
megafranc balance. Two stock 
distributions brought his and 
Olgas wealth up into the two-hu- 
man class. They were now entitled 
to more cargo space, lavish life- 
support, and more powerful drive 
units. A two-human ship. 

Olga must have known this 
when she simulated the Drum 
Dance. They were in the commu- 
nication net at the time. She had 
known and had tried a not-so-sub- 
tle promotion of Rau Lu. As usu- 
al, Olga was probably right. She 
wanted him to go hetero— same 
species, different sex, Well, Rau 
Lu probably wouldn’t be too bad 
to Ship Up with — if only she 
could love. 

Spider put in three requests— 
one to the company .for permis- 



sion to go' two-human; another to 
Com Cen for Rau Lu’s present 
position and the third to Olga for 
analysis of Rau Lu’s inability to 
love. Then he limped down to the 
game room. 

Most of the meck-chess cubicles 
were filled, but he could see by the 
settings that no one was playing 
over the 1600 level. Not much 
self-esteem in the planet-bound 
these days, he reflected. He 
dragged his weakening right leg 
into a handy foamy alcove and en- 
joyed a couple open-top drinks. 
It was sort of fun to look down in- 
to a glass and see a real ice cube 
—and watch it stay down there 
while it melted. Gravity did have 
some entertainment value. 

The Company Immunopsychol- 
ogist called him in. 

“Immuno what?” Spider asked 
.after shaking the hand Of the bald 
little man in white coveralls; 

‘‘Psychologist. Call me May- 
nard. I have your request to go 
two-human. I’d like to discuss it 
with you.” . 

He noticed Spider’s discomfort 
while standing and waved him in- 
to a slick, soft chair. 

“I see you are considering 
hetero. I’d like to point out some 
of the hazards of Shipping Up 
with the same species.” 

He activated a wall panel di- 
rectly in front of Spider. Graphs 
and statistics appeared. Spider 
let his mind wander. 

“Of course hetero has its place. 



80 



IF 




Sexual reproduction and all that. 
But now mechanical embryogene- 
sis has made even that largely un- 
necessary. We’ve learned that4iet- 
ero is actually dangerous— crimes 
of violence being statistically most ■' 
common between people who are 
the closest. When hetero relation- 
ships were legally binding we ob- 
served serious interpersonal con- 
flicts most frequently .in pairs 
dwelling in the smallest living 
quarters. 

“Immunology traced the etiolo- 
gy to the antigen-antibody reac- 
tion — hence the emergence of our 
field: Immunopsychology. Anti- 
gens from one human — bits of 
protein in skin scales, hair dust, 
sperm, saliva — anything — would 
cause the build-up of antibodies 
in the other. At first this might 
be manifest as a mild incompati- 
bility, such-as sterility between the 
pair. But both would prove fertile 
when matched with an antigenic 
stranger. Later the mere presence 
of the partner could precipitate 
significant stress responses — even 
asthmalike attacks or coronary 
spasms. In most cases of moderate 
close exposure the antibody titre 
reached the critical level in about 
seven years.” 

Spider failed to see the reason 
for all this. 

“In starships hetero has caused 
many mission failures. Loving 
pairs are sent off but they fail to 
arrive at their destinations. The 
same missions are repeated easily 



by single-human-ships and the hu 
man/alien pairs. Hetero failures 
were often due to acquired person- 
ality conflicts — tragic, Violent con- 
flicts. Ship’s logs showed mount- 
ing stress — anxieties that were 
precipitated by the partner. Even 
the surviving hetero pairs often 
reported symptoms of stress. The 
explanation came when we found 
the antibodies. Each member of 
the hetero pair had built up anti- 
bodies against the other. The 
titres correlated well — directly 
proportional to the stress.” 
“Female humans are out?” 
asked Spider. 

T HE little scientist nodded. 
“Too hazardous.” 

“What do you recommend for 
your two-seaters?” asked Spider. 
He. had made a mental note to 
check with Olga on this new anti- 
body-insanity theory. Starships 
often kept their own statistics and 
cdnclusions — trying their own 
remedies. 

Maynard had cleared the wall 
panel. “The Quad has been one of 
our most — ” 

. “Quad!” interrupted Spider. 
“That alien coelenterate! Why, 
I’d consider him more of a pet 
than a partner.” 

“He probably thinks much the 
same of you.” Maynard smiled. 
“And he isn’t a coelenterate, of 
course. Warm-b'looded. Totally 
alien antigens. No danger of aller- 
gy.”

Spider tried to picture himself 
shipping out with an amorphous, 
sac-iike Quad. No, ,he preferred 
Rau Lou. Thanking the Immuno- 
psychologist, he hobbled back to 
his tender and lifted off. As soon 
as he felt the no-gray he pulled 
off the prosthesis and wiggled the 
sore toes on his gnarled right foot. 

“Antibody danger in hetefo?” 
asked Olga. “It’s a danger— but 
not if environmental controls are 
functioning. Recycled air and 
water must be molecularly cleaned 
with filters, carbonizers. Your 
dermal debris should feed plank- 
ton — not sensitize your partner. 
It is always a concern but not 
enough to cancel out hetero. Rau 
Lou’s failure to love— frigidity — 
was also a by-product of starship 
environment. Both of you have 
reached an equilibrium with your 
life-support Systems — particularly- 
the hydrocarbons of your ship. 
Your taste and smell are those of 
the ship. She can’t love you in 
your present flavor because she 
associates it with females. Our 
hydroponics plant is the yellow 
turnip — the rutabaga. On her 
home planet the women chew the 
dried and cured rutabaga leaf. So, 
you probably tasted too much like 
her sister to arouse any sexual at- 
traction.” 

Spider frowned. 

“I taste like a girl?” 

“You taste — and smell— like a 
rutabaga. To Rau Lou that is fe- 
ifiale.” 



He relaxed. That would cer- 
tainly be easy tb remedy. Celery 
could be quickly substituted for 
the yellow turnip as the hydropon- 
ics plant. By the time he again met 
Rau Lou he would be a changed 
man — or rather, a changed veg- 
etable. 

Olga continued: “The men of 
Kliiborne work in mines and re- 
lated industries. I’ve added es- 
sence of char and some copper 
ions to your refresher fluids. That 
might trigger the masculine label 
in her -taste buds. As for body 
paint— I think she would be at- 
tracted by a coarsely granular 
brown stucco. That would go well 
with — ” 

Spider stepped into Olga's ram- 
blings. 

“How do you happen to have 
so much information on Rau 
Lou?” 

The console went silent for sev- 
eral full seconds. 

“Your red-feather reaction ap- 
peared during your biochess game 
with Rau Lou. When I learned 
that your opponent was a female, 
why, I naturally assumed — ” 

“I know what you assumed. But 
where did you get all the informa- 
tion? Did you happen to meet her 
ship while we were at the Grus 
Station?” 

“Yes, my human.” 

“And you ' arranged a data 
' transfer?” 

' “Yes, my human.” 

He slumped. Now her ship khew

as much about him as Olga knew 
about her. He shuddered to think 
of what kind of a mating dance 
Rau Lou’s ship might simulate 
from his data. 

His Com Cen request for Rau 
Lou’s location was finally an- 
swered. She was missing. Her warp 
trail ended soon after passing 
through the Fomalhaut system. 
The probability cone was largely 
a “cold zone.” She was lost in a 
volume of space devoid of lumi- 
nous bodies— and she had been 
there for over a year. 

A personal search was out of the 
question— too expensive. But Olga 
weighed the possibility of salvag- 
ing Rau Lou’s cargo plus a pay- 
ing cargo to Fomalhaut against the 
odds. It would be financially risky 
— but they’d go. 

S EVERAL months later they 
were picking their way through 
the scanty frozen debris of the 
cold zone. Spider was depressed. 

“This is as bad as being between 
arms of the spiral or Off Galaxy. 
I can’t see how anyone could sur- 
vive here. There’s not even a good 
first mag star — let alone a sun,” 
he said . 

“She’d have to live like we are 
— full life ^support. Need her own 
power source. That is good in a 
way — for It gives us something to 
find. Any energy should stand out 
easily against this empty tack- 
ground.” 

- Spider worried about the ex- 



pense. The small token cargo they 
carried -to Fomalhaut barely cov- 
ered their energy expenditure out. 
Olga assured him that there were 
megafrancs to spare even if they 
didn’t salvage Rau Lu’s ship. He 
was uneasy about the amount of 
time in the search pattern — know- 
ing the cost of sustaining a zigzag 
course where momentum is re- 
peatedly wasted as directions are 
reversed. 

Olga’s sensors sniffed out the 
tenuous ion trail of a conventional 
drive. They followed it hopefully 
until it disappeared in the gravity 
well of a cold star. 

“That reads like a real hole in 
space,” said Spider, looking at the 
indicators. 

. “Yes, not much is getting 
through the pull. We can’t go down 
there. Have to go around and take 
up the search pattern on the other 
side,” 

“Radiation source,” Olga noted 
later. 

The screen showed a rogue plan- 
et of about the same mass as 
Deneb One. Without a warming 
sun its atmosphere and oceans 
were crystallized. A single pin- 
'point radiation source was present 
—primarily gamma rays. Spider 
turned up the magnification but 
all he saw was the raw, unweath- 
ered rocky ^terrain — needle-point 
peaks, razor sharp crevices wher- 
ever he looked. 

Olga orbited and scanned. 

“The radiation source is not nat-

uraU” said Olga . “I'll have to send 
down my Mobile Surface Unit to 
check it out. I keep getting out- 
lines that resemble a ship, but they 
are elusive. Do you want to go 
down, too? There’s just about a 
full gravity.” ✓ 

Spider nodded. “If Rau Lu is 
down there I might be needed.” 

A S HIS tender approached the 
surface Spider adjusted a soft 
knee cushion and shin guard on 
his long left leg and practiced 
crawling. With a padded glove on 
hisv larger right hand he had a 
three-point stance which would 
probably be stable enough for the 
cracked and tilted surface he had 
seen through the scanners. But 
standing on his small right foot 
and kneeling with his left made 
him shorter than Rau Lu — by low- 
ering his height about eighteen in- 
ches. Crawling did nothing for 
his ego, either. He decided to try 
the prosthesis and crutches. 

Setting down about a hundred 
yards from the radiation, he sent 
the M.S.U. ahead while he prac- 
ticed walking on the irregular sur- 
face. The crutch tips slipped and 
the prosthesis caught in the cracks. 
His ankle ached. The M.S.U. dis- 
appeared over a steep, jagged 
ridge. 

The darkness was absolute. 
Harsh light beams from the tender 
penciled about — catching the sur- 
face formations in their glare— but 
the depths of the cracks remained 

84 



an opaque black. There was no 
diffusion of the beams without an 
atmosphere. Setting his hand 
beam on wide-soft focus. Spider 
struggled after the M.S. U. 

The frozen, silent planet fought 
him. The tilted, slick surfaces of- 
fered precarious footing — glassy 
mineral, fused metal or simple ice, 
he couldn’t tell. Gravity seemed to 
be pulling him toward the bottom- 
less crevices — the fall alone would 
kill him. The only sounds he heard 
were the unsteady tread of his 
prosthesis and tapping of his 
crutch as he searched for his next 
foothold. 1 

His senseless, artificial foot — 
unable to evaluate*— stood on a 
brittle, crystalloid sponge. As he 
shifted his weight it crumbled — 
sending him tumbling hard. Mo- 
mentarily stunned, he lay in a 
shallow recess, isolated by the dark 
vacuum. 

“Stay there,” came Olgas. or- 
der over his communicator. 
“We’ve found the radiation source. 
It isn’t Rau Lu’s ship.” 

Spider tried to untangle him- 
self from his bent crutch and 
twisted prosthesis. He didn’t know 
whether to be worried or relieved. 
He had not wanted Rau Lu to 
see him this* way — a helpless crip- 
ple. But, then, where was she? 

The zetetic M.S.U. continued, 
“Alien craft — megayears a dere- 
lict — molecular drift has fused the 
hull to the contiguous surfaces of 
the planet.” 

IP 




Spider crawled to the top of the 
ridge to see the wreck. The pitted 
and granular hull was difficult to 
outline from the landscape but it 
was roughly cylindrical. Its age 
suggested that the civilization that 
had spawned it might well have 
evolved into something unrecog- 
nizable by now. 

“Where’s the radiation coming 
from?” asked Spider as he heard 
his suit detector clicking wildly! 

“Someone has cut into it recent- 
ly. Looks like the power cell has 
been emptied. Resembles our 
Quark-Bottle design — although 
megayear stability is hard to ex- 
plain.” 

Spider retreated behind the 
tilted slag. His detector quieted. 
Tell-tales indicated heavy gamma 
radiation. 

“The cuts fit those made by the 
Bodkin-Ill. Rau Lu’s M.S.U. was 
equipped with one,” continued 
the M.S.U. 

It busied itself with sampling 
the walls of the power cell for ele- 
ments with induced radioactivity. 
It gave the percentage of each, 
element in isotope form. Spider 
immediately calculated that the 
source of the radiation had been 
removed well within Rau Lu’s 
missing period. Only 0.04% of the 
copper was in isotope form. But 
zinc was still about 50% radioac- 
tive and sodium, was as high as 
85%. This indicated that someone 
had come along about eight stan- 
dard months ago and tapped the 

A GAME OF BIOCHESS 



Quark-Bottle. Rau Lu could have 
been in this area for well over a 
year by now. Spider relaxed. Any- 
one with technology capable of 
tapping a Q-Bottle was probably 
in good enough shape to survive. 

The M.S.U. vibrated its heat 
shield to rid itself of isotope de-. 
bris. Then it turned, picked up 
Spider and returned to the tender. 
He wrapped his sprained little an- 
kle and took a nap. After taking 
the tender onboard, Olga let him 
continue sleeping while she took 
up the search pattern again. 

Several days later they came up- 
on a hot fragment of the alien 
power cell — probably jettisoned 
after its energy had been extracted. 
It marked the beginning of the 
elusive ion trail and narrowed the 
search area considerably. 

S PIDER double-checked the' hy- 
droponics for the yellow turnip 
and tried on his brown stucco body 
paint. He had already gotten used 
to the cupric and char flavor of his 
laminar flow. The carbonizers 
were functioning well in the air re- 
circulators. Micro-Pore filters in 
the refresher and other water lines 
were removing anything larger 
than a salt molecule— anything 
that might sensitize. 

His ankle mended quickly. He 
was ready to meet Rau Lu again. 

Three weeks later they found 
her ship silently anchored to a 
planetoid. Spider was glad to see 
that the planetoid’s mass was only 



85 




about a tenth that of Deneb One. 

Olga's greetings were not an- 
swered. Rau Lu’s ship showed no 
signs of meek life. The scanners 
picked out Rau Lu’s survival shel- 
ter inflated over a nearby valley. 
Cables connected it to the ship 
and the fractionating columns 
were erected — indicating some at- 
tempt at mining the local gas and 
water solids. 

Olga nestled gently against the 
quiet starship and connected air- 
locks. She sent her servomech into 
its hull to investigate. Spider suited 
up and started for the survival 
shelter — with a copper coin in his 
mouth. 

Inside he found about twenty 
acre-feet of airspace tinder eight- 
tenths of an atmosphere. Powerful 
light sources from the hydroponics 
section hung ^overhead, warming - 
his face and hands. The floor — a 
rocky conglomerate — supported a 
monotonous growth of white pota- 
toes. A small pool at the lower end 
had the scummy look of phyto- 
plankton. She had certainly kept 
busy. 

He had been worrying about 
what effect this prolonged isola- 
tion might have had on her psyche 
but she apparently had had little 
free time for her to worry about it. 
He was impressed by her success 
with tools: the cannibalized Q-Bot- 
tle, the fractionating columns and 
operating shelter biosphere. He 
supposed that her lack of contact 
with sentient living beings had 



been very depressing. If her ship’s 
meck-intelligence had cut out — as 
he suspected — she had had no one 
to talk to. The only living things 
around seemed to be these potato 
plants with their uniform, three- 
centimeter, white, meaty spheres 
pushing up through the moist 
gravel. Of course there were ani- 
mal life forms in the zooplankton 
— but how much companionship 
can be derived from a pet that can 
only be seen with a microscope? 

“Hi, Spider.’’ 

The casual greeting came over 
his communicator. 

He glanced around and then saw 
Rau Lu — sans paint — coming out 
of her spherical living quarters. 
She wore a heavy, -knee-length 
wraparound. Its hem was stained 
green with plant juices. Her hair 
was tied back neatly and her hands 
were calloused. She was carrying 
an armload of personal belongings 
which she immediately stacked by 
the airlock. 

“You’re packed?” he asked. 

“Heard your ship’s hail on my 
communicator. Couldn’t answer. 
Not enough power. So I’ve -just 
been getting ready to go,” she ex- 
plained. 

She beckoned him inside the 
spherical shelter and busied her- 
self at the wall-panel controls. He 
waited in the middle of the room, 
the bulky helmet under his small 
left arm. His right teg prosthesis 
balanced easily in the light gravity. 

He saw a large potted potato 



86 



IF 




plant beside her bed. It was unusu- 
al. Besides the clusters of small 
white tubers, there was one large, 
lumpy one that had a greefi skin. 
It sat in the center of the pot and 
peered up at him through the tan- 
gle of green leafy stems. The bi- 
zarre lumpy shape was a genetic 
throwback to its distant ancestors 
and the chforophyll was an adjust- 
ment to the prolonged exposure to 
the hydroponics light source. 

She saw him looking at the pot- 
ted plant and said, “I’ll be taking 
that along too. Pretty fond of it. 
It’s the biggest life-form I’ve seen 
since I’ve been stuck here. Kept 
me company. Beautiful isn’t it?” 

He nodded absently as he took a 
closer look. Then it began to look 
too familiar as he anthropomor- 
phized its pair of embryonic scale 
eyes and lumpy outline. Asymmet- 
rical potato— beautiful? 

The room temperature dropped 
about ten degrees, chilling his 
hands and face. She opened the 
oxygen valve. It gave a loud hiss. 

“Why are you turning up the 
oxygen?” he asked. 

“You are going to need it,” she 
said. She dimmed the lights, 
shrugged out of her wrap-around 
and advanced on him. 

It was a red-feather day for the 
asymmetricaLpotato. 

T WO pints of eccrine electro- 
lytes, later Spider lay trapped 
by her clinging extremities. She 
pressed her forehead into his ear, 

A GAME OF BIOCHESS 



breathed into his neck and mum- 
bled on and on about how happy 
she was. His presence had made 
her almost euphoric. 

She was a very stable human — 
capable of sensible efforts for sur- 
vival. Solitude — she could handle 
solitude unless it was indefinite- 
then it became loneliness. She was 
good with tools but when she be- 
came lonely her tools gathered in- 
ertia. She craved something alive 
and responsive. Her potato had 
responded to her touch, growing 
well with the light and water she 
showered on it. It grew, changed 
and became asymmetrical. The 
unresponsive tools remained cold 
and symmetrical. 

She had now been in deepspace 
long enough to equate asymmetry 
with life. 

Spider was beautiful to her — 
because he was alive and because 
he was there. In the absence of 
gravity he was efficient, strong, 
capable — and exhibited no limp. 

With Rau Lou’s crippled star- 
ship in tow Olga set a course for 
Rau Lou’s target planet. The sus- 
pended genetic material in the car- 
go section was still viable. Its val-

For several days Spider and 0/-

“I know,” Brand gasped. 

The suit was too damned heavy. 
Something was wrong in the feed- 
back. Something was wrong in this 
whole setup. 

“Brand,” Davidson blurted. 
“How do you read rendezvous?” 

Brand dropped to one knee on 
the rocky mountainside, turning 
away from the burning city below. 
He flashed a time reading on the 
inside of his helmet’s faceplate. 

“Three minutes,” he said. 

“Then let’s get the hell out of 
here.” 

Brand sighed, knowing that 
there was no point in arguing. 
They had to make rendezvous or 
they were stuck on New Iowa for 
good. As trustworthy as he be- 
lieved the Dravians to be, he knew 
they would not make two runs 
down to pick them up. If he, 
Davidson and Wjsse— sole survi- 
vors of the raiding party that had 
hit the colonial city — did not make 
rendezvous they were on their 
own. 

“Roger.” 

Brand could see the faint glow of 
Wisse’s reaction pack as it assisted 
him in a six-meter leap up the 
mountain slope. Davidson, too, 
jump-jetted up the slope toward 
the plateau and the homing signal 
transmitted from the rendezvous 
site. 

Brand paused and looked back 
down into the burning city below 
for longer than he should have. 
Better than half of New Iowa City 

90 



was now aflame. Mildly Brand re- 
gretted what he and the others 
had had to do. They really had not 
planned on destroying more than 
a few essential places— power sta- 
tions, water works, central com- 
munications, things like that. But 
neither had they counted on the 
kind of resistance the colonists had 
put up. The half-assed farmer- 
colonists from Old Earth had nev- 
er shown much in the way of de- 
fenses in the past. 

The homing transmitter flashed 
a reading on Brand’s faceplate. 
Looking, up the slope toward the 
crest, he found he could see nei- 
ther Davidson nor Wisse. He had 
to catch up. 

The reaction pack kicked at his 
back and his feet kicked at the 
earth below him. The force of his 
legs was amplified a dozen times 
by the suit and he moved cursing 
all New Iowans — and the partic- 
ular one who had blown a build- 
ing out from under him with an 
H.E. bomb he hadn’t suspected 
that the colonists possessed. Well, 
they hadn’t figured on the colo- 
nists coming up with combat suits 
either. Still, he’d been hit harder 
than he thoughts The damned suit 
had been damaged — read-outs told 
him so clearly enough— but not so 
badly that he couldn’t get to the 
pickup site, even if he did have to 
work a little harder at it. He sure 
as hell wasn’t going to let the 
Dravians take off without him — 
not with what they owed him. 

(F 




It was kick and jet, kick and jet. 
Sluggish though it was, the com- 
bat suit carried him up the slope, 
over the rough, ancient boulders 
and angular outcroppings of rock, 
over and around the gnarled trees, 
up toward the safety of the pla- 
teau. '' 

A NOTHER full minute had 
passed before he crested the 
plateau and landed again on level, 
solid earth. Snapping the night 
visor down with a twist of his head, 
through infrared he made out the 
dim figures of Davidson and Wisse 
no more than half a kilometer 
away. Few trees up here obscured 
the view and the ground itself was 
surprisingly level. An odd geologi- 
cal formation, some remote part 
of his mind commented — but 
somehow these mountains re- 
minded him of -home, the hairsh 
beauty of Breakdown Heights 
where mere survival was some- 
thing to be proud of. Not like the 
soft living the damned New Io- 
wans had in the lush valleys be- 
low. 

Where Davidson and Wisse 
stoqd had to be the place. Brand 
told himself. The image projected 
against his faceplate agreed. The 
homer was transmitting from 
straight ahead. And a time pro- 
jection told Brand that forty-five 
seconds remained until rendez- 
vous. The Dravian corvette ought 
to be coming info view any time. 
Running, leaping, assisted by 



the reaction pack but still fighting 
the sluggishness of the suit, he 
crossed the distance to where his 
companions stood. 

“You almost blew it,” Davidson 
said sarcastically. 

“We all almost blew it,” Brand 
replied, remembering what had 
happened in the city below. 

“They ought to be in sight,” 
Davidson said, looking up into the 
night sky again. “Ought to be 
firing retros by now.” 

“Ought to be,” Wisse repeated 
quietly. “Which way would they 
come?” 

“From the north, I think,” 
Brand replied, flashing a compass 
image on his faceplate and then 
looking into the sky in that direc- 
tion. 

“We ought to see ’em by now,” 
Davidson said. 

Brand read the time. 

“They’re due,” 

“More than due,” Wisse said. 
“They’re fifteen seconds late.” 

“Give them a chance,” David- 
son said. “They’ll show up.” 

“Yeah, I know they will,” Wisse 
half-heartedly agreed. 

“Well, the Fuzzies never failed 
us before.” Davidson’s voice was 
almost angry. 

“There’s always a first time,” 
Wisse said but apparently regret- 
ted it immediately. 

He forced a laugh that did no- 
thing to cheer Brand. 

Neither Brand nor Davidson 
spoke. They just read the time.

looked back at the sky, read the 
time again. / 

Davidson, with reddish-blonde 
hair and a florid face beneath the 
helmet of his combat suit, was the 
biggest of the three men. But even 
he was not tall when compared 
with most representatives of man- 
kind. Breakdown Heights, with a 
gravity of nearly one-and-a-half 
Gs, was noted for the strength and 
endurance of its natives, not their 
height. 

Brand was shorter than David- 
son, though he made up for. his 
lack of height by the width -and 
massiveness of his shoulders. His 
face, too, was wide. His eyes were 
deep, dark pools behind the 
covering of his helmet. He was 
the loner of the group, a man with 
few friends, one whose quick 
^temper did not encourage close re- 
lationships. Now he was doing an 
excellent job of keeping his tem- 
per in check. He knew he had to. 

Wisse was shorter still than 
Brand and slighter of build — but 
still a man whose physical 
strength had been nurtured by the 
massive, desolate homeworld of 
the mercenaries. His thin face 
could barely be seen inside his hel- 
met. 

There was growing, concern on 
it. 

“A full minute,” he said. 
‘They’ve never been late for a 
pickup before.” His voice was se- 
riously worried. 

“How far behind us do you 



think they were?” Davidson asked, 
turning to Brand. 

“Ten minutes maybe,” Brand 
replied, feeling the concern be- 
ginning to grow within himself. 
“Parker slowed, them down when 
he set off that mini A-bomb in the 
river.” 

“I hope he slowed them,” Wisse 
said. 

Ido , too. 

Brand remembered that Park- 
er himself had died in the minia- 
ture nuclear blast that had wid- 
ened the river into a new lake in 
the center of the city. Beyond that 
it was all a jumble in his mind 
now, what happened down there 
in New Iowa City. But it had clear- 
ly been an ambush — the New Io- 
wans fitted out in combat suits as 
good as those of the raiders, com- 
ing out of doorways, leaping from 
roofs, moving with the pre- 
cision of trained troops, in mo- 
ments surrounding the raiders who 
had expected to meet no real re- 
sistance at all. The New Iowans 
had never known anything like 
that before; not when the merce- 
naries had hit the farms and smal- 
ler towns. 

S OME good men died there, he 
told himself. Twenty-seven of 
the hardest mercenaries in the 
galaxy had bought it before the 
three of them — four, but Parker 
had not made it all the way — 
fought their way out of the trap, 
throwing thermos and H.E.’s and 



92 




everything else they had in every 
direction' and made it up the 
mountain to the plateau and the 
rendezvous spot. 

Dammit, I wish they’d hurry, 
Brand told himself. 

“Two minutes,’’ Davidson said, 
his voice a dead calm. 

“What’s wrong with them?” 
Wisse demanded. 

“They’ll. come,” Brand said. He 
was senior man now. He ought to 
take command, if you could call 
it that. “Their timing’s just off, 
that’s all.” 

He looked up at the sky again. 
Still nothing, still an absolute 
nothing, unless you counted the 
brilliant stars of New Iowa’s sky, 
something you didn’t when you 
were looking for a Dravian cor- 
vette. 

“Wisse,” he said suddenly, “go 
back to the cliff and see if the 
farmers really are following us.” 

“What if the Fuzzies come?” 
Wisse demanded. 

“If they come, we’ll make them 
wait.” 

“No, you go.” 

Brand swung up his right arm, 
the one whose sleeve housed the 
rocket launcher. He leveled it at 
the chest of Wisse’s suit. 

“Go back and look . ” 

Wisse did not speak but after a 
few moments and another search 
of the sky he turned and loped 
back toward the edge of tho pla- 
teau. 

“Wonder what’s keeping them,” 



Davidson muttered, apparently 
inore to himself than to Brand. 

“Bad timing.” 

“Nonsense. You ever heard of a 
Fuzzy being a second off? I don’t 
like none pf this.” 

Turning toward the plateau’s 
edge. Brand said through the 
radio link, “See anything, Wisse?” 

“They’re coming up.” 

Panic was in the other man’s 
voice. 

Damn. 

Brand wondered who had 
picked Wisse for a mercenary? He 
ought to be a klopak fisherman. 
Starting to break down at the first 
little — and then he remembered 
the slaughter in the city. The pic- 
ture was damned near impossible 
— he didn’t know whether to be 
ashamed of the Breakdowners or 
whether to admire the colonists. 
If they really were colonists — he 
pondered for a moment. But if not 
New Iowans, who then? 

“How many?” he asked. 

“Can’t tell,” said Wisse’s voice 
in his earphones. “Couple of doz- 
en.” 

“Can’t be,” Davidson said. 
“There couldn’t have been so 
many of ’em left. Parker must’ve 
killed off a whole squad himself.” 

“Calm down and count them,” 
Brand commanded. “They ought 
to be emitting enough infrared for 
that.” 

He checked the time. Five 
minutes. Hard to believe Dravians 
could be that far off schedule. 



HI RED MAN

“Fourteen,” Wisse ? s voice said 
after a while. “I clearly count 
fourteen of them in combat suits.” 

His voice was calmer now. He 
had regained control of himself. 

“Too many,” Davidson said. 
“We couldn’t hold ’em.” 

“We might have to,” Brand 
said. “They can’t be much better 
off than we are.” 

“They haven’t been under full 
power as long as we have,” David- 
son replied. 

Brand nodded in agreement but 
said, “Better check all our sys- 
tems.” Then to Wisse:. “How far 
away?” 

“Less than halfway up the 
slope*.” the other replied. “It’ll 
take them a good ten minutes to 
get up here.” 

And if the Fuzzies don’t show 
up in another ten minutes. 

Brand let his thoughts trail off. 

“Come on back,” he said. 

While he waited for Wisse’s re- 
turn he made a quick read-out of 
his suit systems and wished he 
hadn’t. The suit was worse off than 
he thought. More than half of his 
all-important feedback circuits 
had already gone to backups and 
a few were out altogether. Am- 
munition was just about gone, as 
was the internal air supply, though 
he could switch to external if 
things didn’t get too hot. Fuel for 
the reaction pack was next to noth- 
ing and his power cells — well, you 
could expect only so much out of 
the thumbnail-size cells these suits 



carried and he had been running i 
hard ever since he hit the atmos- 
phere just after the beginning of 
New Iowa’s long night. 

“How is it?” he asked David- 
son. 

“The suit? Still working but I 
don’t- have much power left. Hour 
or two.” 

You’re ahead of me. 

Brand read the time. The Dravi- 
ans were an impossible seven-and- 
a-half minutes late. 

Wisse was back and began to 
check out his own suit systems. 

" “You act like you’re runnin’ the 
show now. Brand,” DaVidson said. 
“How.do you figure it?” 

“L don’t,” Brand answered. “I 
just wait here until they -come for 
us/’ 

“And what if they don’t come?” 
Wisse asked, that edge of panic 
returning to his.vQice. 

.Brand’s voice was cold. “They 
will.” 

How can you be so damn sure?” 
Davidson demanded. “They ain’t 
people. How do you know what 
they decided to do. Hell, man, we 
don’t even know why we’re 
fightin’ here.” 

“How long have we been work- 
ing for the Fuzzies?” Brand asked. 

“Nearly a standard,” Davidson 
replied. 

“Have they ever failed us yet?” 

“Like Wisse said — ” 

“They’ll show! In the meantime 
we’d better prepare a defensive 
position.” 



94 



IF 




“You’re out of your mind,” 
Davidson said. , “Wisse counted 
fourteen of ’em. We got no choice 
but to run.’’ Obviously Davidson 
did not like to use the word but 
he used it. “We can carry the 
homer so the Fuzzies’ll know 
where we are.” 

“The homer was for us,” Brand 
said as matter-of-factly as he could 
“They’re not using it. They’ve got 
their own systems.” 

“Still, they could monitor it,” 
Wisse said. 

“They said they’d pick us up 
here,” Brand said. 

“Yeah, and they said they’d do 
it nine minutes ago.” 



T HE three men stood glaring at 
each other through the thick 
helmets of their cqmbat suits. 
Maybe the others could run, Brand 
thought, for a little while. They 
had more reserve power than he 
had — their suits were in better 
shape. But he knew that his suit 
would not carry him more than a 
couple of kilofneters. And when 
he did have to fight again he 
wanted some power for what 
weapons systems he had left. 

“Ten minutes now,” Davidson 
said, his voice oddly quiet. “In less 
than five they’re going to come 
busting over that crest and those 
boys are mad. I ain’t fool enough 
to stand around and wait for 
them.” 

“Wait five more minutes,” 



Brand said, neither commanding 
nor begging. He no longer gave a 
damn what they did. 

“No,” Davidson said and looked 
to Wisse for agreement. “We’re 
taking the homer and we’re head- 
ing for those peaks over to the 
east! Maybe if we get there we can 
hold them off.” 

“For how long?” 

“A hell of a lot longer than we 
could from here.” 

Eleven minutes. 'Maybe the 
Dravians really aren’t coming. 

. They aren’t human. How do you 
know what they’re really thinking? 

During these agonizing waits, 
memories flashed through Brand’s 
mind — one of the Dravians com- 
ing to Breakdown Heights and hir- 
ing a troop of mercenaries to drive 
the colonists from Old Earth off 
Brahiban III, or New Iowa, as the 
colonists and Earih’s federation 
called the planet. Mercenaries 
prided themselves on being what 
they were— why not fight against 
humans on the side of a bunch of 
stubby, red, six-legged Dravians? 
The Fuzzies paid in hard cash and 
what did the men of Breakdown 
Heights owe New Iowa, or even 
Earth? 

Breakdowners had fought for 
and against just about every sen- 
tient race in the galaxy anyway. 
What did a little terrorism on New 
Iowa matter? 

But what if the Dravians had 
decided not to pay off? 

» The eventuality seemed un-

HI RED MAN 




likelyr The Fuzzies didn’t work 
that way. 

The Dravians would come. They 
had simply been delayed. 

By what? 

Twelve minutes. At last David- 
son spoke again. 

“You cornin’ with us?” 

“Take the homer. I’ll stay 
here.” 

“You’re a damn fool.” 

“We’ll see.” 

Brand turned his attention away 
from the others and began to 
searching for something - that re- 
sembled a defensive position. He 
saw a few trees and a few boulders 
— and up ahead about half a kilo- 
meter or so was a sizable depres- 
sion in the ground, as well shel- 
tered as anything on the plateau. 

“Brand,” Davidson said sud- 
denly after he had picked up the 
homing transmitter and tucked it 
under his arm. “Come with us. 
You don’t stand a chance here.” 

• “I don’t have power enough to 
make it halfway to those'peaks of 
yours,” he said slowly, bitterly. 
“I’m better off here.” 

Thirteen minutes. The combat- 
suited and deadly furious New Io- 
wans would be coming over the 
crest any time now. 

“I guess you know what you’re 
doing,” Davidson said. 

“I hope you do,” Brand replied. 

Brand could hear Davidson’s 
snort through the earphones of his 
helmet but none of the three men 
'Spoke again. , 



T URNING his back on his com-] 
panions. Brand bit down on the l 
switch that broke him from the| 
radio link and, as quickly as he| 
could, crossed the distance to the] 
depression. By the time he reached : 
it and turned to look back, David- : 
son and Wisse had vanished, mov- 
ing toward the peaks some kilo- 
meters away. He wondered if they 
would make it and what they 
would do when they got there. 

Settling down in what protec- 
tion the broken earth, stone and 
few trees offered, he threw one 
more glance skyward. Nothing. No 
bright movement there to indi- 
cate the arrival of. the Dravians. 

His gaze dropped to the edge of 
the plateau, where the fourteen 
New Iowans would soon be arriv- 
ing. 

That some people might consid- 
er this a batf way to die never en- 
tered his mind. His father and his 
father before him had died on 
alien worlds, fighting other peo- 
ple’s battles. He had always ex- 
pected to go that way, too. But he 
had hoped, for a few more visits to 
Breman’s Planet before that time 
came. Well, he could remember 
the last visit — and that had been 
one hell of a.time. 

He shifted the energy rifle from 
his backpack, fitted it into the 
suit’s shoulder socket, checked the 
weapon’s internal power and was 
gratified to see that it still had a 
little charge. He could draw from 
his Suit cells for the rifle but de- 



IF

tided against it He would need 
that power for other things. 

S IGHTING the weapon along 
the plateau’s horizon, he 
waited. 

And while he waited he ' could 
not help but wonder about the sin- 
cerity of the aliens for whom he 
worked. They had never before 
given him any reason to doubt 
them. Now he could only wait a 
little longer, give them the bene- 
fit of his doubts and hope they 
would show up soon. 

Then he saw, through his night 
visor, the infrared glow of a man’s 
warm body and the heat of an op? 
erating combat suit. He felt no re- 
coil as the energy rifle fired. The 
weapon’s brilliant blaze was only 
partially dimmed by the night vi- 
sor and the polarization of the hel- 
met’s filters. For an instant the 
combat-suited figure blazed with 
the same light — then exploded. 

One down. Brand flashed a time 
reading on the inside of his hel- 
met. The Fuzzies were a full fif- 
teen minutes late. 

No further movement came 
along the horizon for a while. 
When it did come it was hard to 
see, even with the night visor. The 
New Iowans had cut back on the 
infrared emission of their suits — 
damned good suits for a bunch of 
farmers. 

They were almost invisible when 
they topped the crest, six or sev- 
en of them at once, and rushed 
forward. 



Brand depressed the firing stud 
of the rifle, made a quick sweep 
across his field of fire and saw at 
least one man fall backward down 
the slope, his combat suit explod- 
ing flames. The others, though, fell 
forward, their arms arching above 
their heads as, suit-assisted, they 
threw. 

Grenades shattered the earth 
and rocks of the plateau. 

The colonists had had no time to 
get his position. They were throw- 
ing blind. 

Brand licked the dryness of his 
lips, pulled at his suit’s water nip- 
ple: 

A dozen meters or less to his left 
a grenade exploded, showering 
him with broken stone, shaking the 
earth under him. 

Brand replied in kind but he 
did not have to throw. A tube slid 
up over his left shoulder. He 
guided the grenade launcher with 
his left hand, aiming it, then trig- 
gering it to throw out its two re- 
maining bombs. And he was not 
firing blindly. He had a damned 
good idea of where the colonists 
were. 

The Jiext explosions were more 
distant as his grenades fell near the 
plateau’s edge. He thought he saw 
a twisted figure fly into the air but 
he was not sure, nor did he waste 
time concerning himself with it. 
He had too much to do. 

The remaining colonists had 
crossed the crest. They had their 
own energy rifles, maybe ten or 



HIRED MAN 



97 




twelve of them. More than half 
were firing — and now they knew 
where he was. 

His rifle blazed. He caught a 
rising man full in its glare and the 
man died in the flames. 

Suddenly the colonists’ weapons 
became still as an enormously am- 
plified voice called out, “Cease fir- 
mg. 

Now what? Brand, too, stilled 
his weapon. 

“Mercenary,” the voice called 
out, “listen to me. This is Lieu- 
tenant Hamid of the Federation 
Marines.” 

Federation troops? Brand no 
longer wondered why his opposi- 
tion had not behaved like farmers 
and clerks. By now he had pin- 
pointed the exact location of the 
loud speaker. He aimed the rifle. 

“Surrender, you fool,” the ma- 
rines officer’s voice boomed across 
the plateau. “You’re fighting your 
own kind. You don’t know what 

you’ve gotten into. The Dravians 

... 

are — 

But by now Brand had pressed 
the firing stud and the marine lieu- 
tenant would never speak another 
word. He died in an exploding 
combat suit. 

Brand fired again, sweeping 
across the plateau with the energy 
rifle until he saw its blaze trickle 
down to a pale light, then fade 
out, its charge exhausted. 

He shrugged, snapped the weap- 
on from its socket, ignored its fall 
and launched a homing rocket 



from the sleeve of his right arm. 

What were Federation Marines 
doing in this? He wondered. New 
Iowa was not in the federation. 

S OMETHING exploded beside 
him, lifting him bodily into the 
air, throwing him back to the tor- 
tured earth. He fell on his left 
shoulder, his teeth grating in ag- 
ony. 

He rolled over and came up to 
his knees, trying to orient him- 
self, and then, snapping back the 
night visor, he turned his eyes up- 
ward in one last frantic sweep of 
the sky in the hope that — there it 
was, a moving spot of light, too 
slow to be a meteor, coming down, 
still slowing. 

He turned back toward his at- 
tackers — there seemed to be more 
than Wisse had counted — feeling 
the growing sluggishness of his 
suit, the growing weight of a left 
arm whose feedback circuits were 
hardly working. He tried to find 
the rendezvous spot, recognized it 
on the almost featureless plateau. 
The marines had not yet reached 
it. 

He took no time to count his re- 
maining rockets. He merely loosed 
them in a steady stream toward 
the marines until the magazine 
was empty and the plateau was a 
blaze of exploding missiles. For a 
few instants the marines were dis- 
organized. 

Brand came erect slowly. His 
suit was definitely failing. Circuits

were damaged. Power was run- 
ning low. Feedback was almost un- 
responsive at times. But he did 
get to his feet and he started run- 
ning, snatching the unused slug- 
throwing pistol from his hip and 
firing explosive shells before him 
as he ran. 

The marines took too little time 
to recover, to aim at the running, 
leaping figure. An energy beam 
laced the earth before him, set- 
ting grass aflame. He jetted over 
it. Another beam lashed into his 
backpack, where something ex- 
ploded. His gyros failed.. .He tum- 
bled. in mid-air, fell crashing to 
the earth, his back burned and 
blistered, his lips broken against 
the faceplate of the helmet. 

He staggered to his feet, some- 
where dimly between conscious- 
ness and unconsciousness. He 
stumbled, regained ' his footing, 
ran. 

Now the flame in the sky had 
become a distinct object, a short, 
stubby, wingless Dravian corvette, 
and its crew had seen the battle 
below. Energy cannons, one from 
each side of the ship, fired toward 
the marines. 

Brand sighed a grateful sob and 
fell to his knees. 

One, two— perhaps a dozen 
shots were sent toward the cor- 
vette before the marines broke in 
panic, fell back toward the edge of 
the plateau. They knew they were 
not up to taking on the ship’s can- 
non. 



Somehow Brand was on his feet 
again. He fired a few meaningless 
shots after them. Then he awk- 
wardly ran on toward the landing 
spot. 

The corvette’s final descent 
rockets fired. The ship hovered for 
a moment, then slowly, gently low- 
ered itself to the ground. 

It had hardly touched down 
when Brand reached its side, 
paused, searched for the air lock. 
He found it as it began to open. 
He staggered in and the air cycle 
began. 

A single Dravian was waiting for 
him inside. 

If a Terran mammal had tried to 
look like a spider but had forgotten 
to add the final two legs, it might 
have somewhat resembled a 
Dravian — but not much. The 
roughly egg-shaped body was 
mounted on six legs, each of 
which ended in an appendage that 
could function either as a' foot or a 
hand as the occasion required. 
Body and legs were covered with a 
short, reddish-bronze hair that 
rippled constantly, ventilating the 
skin below. Dravian features, half 
a dozen eyes, an equal number of 
nostrils, a wide, slack mouth, 
fringed hearing organs, wer* all 
fixed in the forward, smaller end 
of the egg. These were what faced 
Brand and spoke to him in aston- 
ishingly Anglo-Terran. 

“Where are the others?” the 
Dravian asked. 

It took a few moments for the 



HIREDMAN

words to sink in. The suit’s audio 
receptors were working fine. 
Brand’s mind was not. 

“Dead, all but two of them,” he 
replied at last, realizing how much 
that last sprint had taken from him. 
“And the other two?” 

“Up in the hills,” Brand told 
him. “They were afraid you 
wouldn’t come. You were late.” 

He could not read Dravian sym- 
bols, so he could not determine 
tjie alien’s rank from the badges he 
wore on his back. 

“Regrettable but unavoidable,” 
the Dravian said. “Come with 
me. 

The Dravian led him down the 
passageway to the area of the ship 
that had been adapted for human 
passengers. 

“Go in,” the Dravian said. “Ad- 
minister to yourself and change 
clothing. The captain will wish to 
see you at once.” 

“Okay,” Brand said, fighting 
the pain of his burned back and 
the fatigue that was washing over 
his body. “But about the others — ” 
“Do not concern yourself with 
them,” the Dravian said and gent- 
ly pushed him into the man-size 
airlock that led into the empty hu- 
man quarters. 

L ESS than ten minutes later 
Brand was out of the combat 
suit, had been treated by an auto- 
medic programed for humans and 
had dressed himself in thermal 
coveralls. He slipped oxygen tanks 



and a cooler onto his back, a fish- 
bowl helmet over his head and 
stepped back into the airlock, feel- 
ing a little more than half alive,. 

What bothered him most as he 
cycled back out through the air 
lock and into the corridor where 
the Dravian waited for him was 
the fact that the corvette was in 
flight and already out of New Io- 
wa’s atmosphere. He had felt the 
ship lift while he was changing, 
had heard the whistle of air along 
the hull as it thinned into the 
vacuum of space. 

Stepping out of the lock, he 
could not help but feel a moment 
of almost irrational anger. 

“Aren’t you going to pick up 
my companions?” he demanded, 
wondering why he cared. They 
had deserted him. 

“We have no time,” the Drav- 
ian replied, pointing down the cor- 
ridor and gesturing for Brand to 
walk in front of him. “We have 
a rendezvous to keep.” 

“They’ll be killed down. there,” 
Brand said, annoyed at himself. 

“We are sorry,” the Dravian 
said in such a way that Brand knew 
there was no point in discussing it 
further. 

A silence held between Brand 
and the Fuzzy until they reached 
a hatch that he was directed to en- 
ter alone. Ducking to pass through 
the hatch, Brand found himself in 
the suite of an alien whom he rec- 
ognized, if only from the numer-

FRUIT OF THE VINE 



This is the earth bound story of 
Charlie Three — and a stardweller 



N OT that it made any differ- 
ence but it was daylight. He 
became aware of the familiar 
numbness in his legs and when his 
vision partially cleared he could 
see that snowflakes were gathering 
on his pants legs. His neck jerked 



and his hands flailed before the 
right impulse reached his knees 
and drew his feet up under him. A 
warm body beside him grumbled 
at the disturbance and struck out 
in dumb protest. 

He tried to twist and turn away 



101 



the numbness, but the effort 
brought only pain. His hands were, 
useless and seemed to maintain an 
uncontrollable position in front of 
his chest, wrists limply touching. 
There was no longer a sense of 
hunger in him and he did not 
know how desperately he needed 
food. There was only an aching 
urge to find a dark corner. 

Stumbling from the doorway, 
he half fell and half crawled across 
the sidewalk to the gutter. Using 
the cars and parking meters for 
support, he made his way slowly 
along the street, trying to find a 
spot. In final desperation he clung 
to a pole, gave up and relaxed. 
And soon, in the freezing snow- 
blown air, he wished he hadn’t. 

A trash receptacle furnished . 
him with newspapers he wadded 
up and shoved down his trousers 
to hold away the cloth. He stuck 
the others into his coat as best he 
could for what warmth they gave 
and staggered off. His body was 
still numb and his chest hurt. 
Trembling, he waited for the in- 
evitable. 

Yet within him still was desire 
for warmth, for hope, for life. 

C APTAIN FOSTER slipped the 
clearance papers into the 
sleeve pocket of his flight tunic 
and left through the air-barrier ex- 
it of Spaceport Operations. He 
picked his way among the maze of 
signs and ramp passages until he 
found the hallway leading to the 
Port Controller’s office. As he ap- 



proached a turn in the corridor 
his nostrils were stung by the sick- 
ening sweet odor of wine, quickly 
followed by a more characteristic 
odor. Space bums, he thought and 
set his features to meet them. 

Turning the corner, Foster had 
to catch himself in midstride to 
avoid falling among them. They 
were scattered about the floor in 
an incredible tangle, making it 
impossible for him to pass. With a 
glance at their multicolored silks, 
Foster guessed there were from 
eight to ten of them. 

He swung a heavy boot toward 
the nearest body. 

“Get out of my way, damn it.’’ 

His foot was caught in its flight 
so abruptly that he was forced to 
grab the wall to remain erect. A 
seven-inch throwing knife quiv- 
ered so close to the other boot 
that the blade nicked the sole. 
The holder of Foster’s foot slowly 
raised his eyelids studying all of 
Foster until their eyes met. 

“Do that again, off-worlder, and 
without doubt you’ll leave here on 
a stretcher.” 

The foot was thrown back like a 
wad of paper and the captain stag- 
gered to regain his balance and 
composure. The man retrieved his' 
knife with deliberate motions and 
retained his blocking position. 

Breaking the deadly silence. 
The Speaker moved away from 
the wall. 

“Ah, you’ll have to forgive The 
Gladiator, good Captain. His man- 



102 



IF 




neris not polished for men of high 
station.” 

“What do you want from me?” 
Foster asked indignantly. 

The Speaker bowed from the 
waist and waved his arm in a 
sweeping gesture at the men who 
- had gotten to their feet during the 
exchange. 

“Passage for an Entertainer, 
Captain.” 

Foster eyed the three figures 
disdainfully and started to refuse. 
A bone-crushing grip on his ankle 
changed his mind. 

“All right, let’s see what you’ve 
got.” The pressure eased. 

“Come forward, Paddy,” said 
The Speaker and one of the En- 
tertainers stepped into the center 
of the corridor. 

He reached inside of his harle- 
quin-marked tunic and deftly pro- 
duced five differently colored 
balls. As each ball spun into mo- 
tion it was readily apparent that 
Paddy was a master juggler. The 
balls flew between his hands only 
briefly before they burst into 
flames. When the last globe had 
ignited Paddy moved control to 
one hand. The walls reflected a 
blur of multicolored fire for sev- 
eral seconds before he pulled the 
balls in. As each stopped its mo- 
tion the flames winked out. 

“Marvelous,” said Foster, gen- 
uinely impressed. “But the Arm- 
eter is a free-fall ship. Of what use 
would a juggler be to me or my 
men?” 



v The Speaker nodded in 
thoughtful agreement. 

“You’re right, of course. Cap- 
tain. I should have thought of it 
myself. Well, here we have The 
Searcher — ” indicating another 
Entertainer. “He’s a mentalist.” 

The Searcher remained lean- 
ing against the wall and Foster 
eyed the greenish cast of his skin 
with prejudice. He had no use for 
Butans or their poison planet. 

“Think of a card. Captain,” said 
The Searcher. 

Foster closed his eyelids slowly, 
indicating that he had done so. 

“The eight of stars,” said The 
Searcher confidently. , 

“The nine of hearts,” corrected 
Foster and then, turning to The 
Speaker: “He needs more prac- 
tice. Anything else?” 

“Only Tokay, our beloved min- 
strel.” The Speaker smiled thinly. 

A small, gnomelike man stepped 
forward, swinging down a guitar 
from behind his back. He, nodded 
to Foster as his fingers quickly 
checked the tune of the instru- 
ment. Tokay was the leader of the 
group and The Planter of the 
seeds. The mission depended on 
his being aboard the starship Arm- 
eter when she lifted. The Searcher 
moved into Foster’s mind and 
waited for Tokay to begin his song. 

Foster listened automatically. 

“All right, that’s enough. You’ll 
do.” 

Foster didn’t care for the music 
himself but his crew was con-

stantly trying to sing some ribald 
lyric or other and now a change of 
sound would do them all good. He 
was not even slightly aware of The 
Searcher’s guidance or withdrawal. 

Tokay bowed. “Thank you.” 

“The ship is on pad twelve and 
we leave within the hour. Be 
there. I won’t wait. Now, if you’ll 
excuse me, I must see the Control- 
ler.” The pressure on his ankle in- 
creased again as he started to 
leave. “What?” he asked, looking 
about. 

“The ramp pass, good Captain,” 
said The Speaker. 

“Oh.” 

Foster swore under his breath. 
He took out a pad of paper and 
scribbled on it. He pushed his 
command ring against the pad 
and, tearing off a sheet, handed it 
to Tokay. The grip on his ankle 
broke and the group of Enter- 
tainers parted. The captain hast- 
ened along the corridor without 
looking back. 

The Speaker put his hand on 
Tokay’s shoulder as they watched 
the captain walk away. 

“I wish it could have been 
someone else. Be careful of him, 
Tokay. He’s a bad one.” 

Tokay smiled and his space-wiz- 
ened wrinkles cracked with the 
effort. 

“I’ll stay out of his way. I don’t 
take kindly to being kicked.” 

The Gladiator grunted and 
wiped his palms across his gar- 
ment. 



A N HOUR later the Entertain- 
ers lay against the outside wall 
of the Operations building, watch- 
ing the Armeter climb through 
the daylight black sky on a tail of 
ion hell. Small tornadoes of sand 
and grit whirled about as the thun- 
derous sound vibrated their bodies 
and threatened to collapse their 
lungs. And then, in diminishing 
squares, the ship was gone except 
for a faint point of light. 

Paddy pulled from his bottle 
and said excitedly, “There she 
goes — the last world. It’s been a 
long time but it was worth the 
wait.” 

Some sighed and many made 
sounds of agreement. The Speaker 
shook his head and disagreed 
gently. 

“I wonder if anything is ever 
really over. There will always be 
another world. And if, by some 
chance, there isn’t — there will 
always be another cause. It seems 
to be part of the curse, of existing 
that man must forever search out 
a cause and dedicate himself to 
it.” 

The Searcher had been follow- 
ing the tiny, receding point of 
light high above the Spaceport. As 
it dimmed out, the scene gradual- 
ly changed for the Entertainers. 
Warm earth supported their 
bodies and a hot sun burned down 
on them. A gentle breeze stirred 
the heart-shaped leaves that 
spread out, row upon row, across 
the easy rolling hills. Each man 



104 



IF 




reacted to the vision in his own 
way and a casual passerby, staring 
at the unfocusing eyes, might have 
wondered why men would de- 
grade themselves to such a level. 

A week passed before one of 
the sleek, silver starships of the 
Federal Police Agency landed. 

N O ONE was willing to admit 
to seeing him as they walked 
by. Their eyes were open and fo- 
cusing and still they parted.around 
him like waves meeting a coral 
reef. He would lurch from one to 
another, trying to beg for money, 
but they would only quickly 
change their steps and dodge him. 
And usually, when his frustration 
had mounted to unbearable limits, 
he would make the mistake of 
grabbing a passing arm. He would 
be spun away or knocked down. 
Often, then, he would sit and cry 
as the masses flowed above him 
and left him alone with his need. 

A feeling of something in his 
hand. Paper. Sometimes a dol- 
lar. Once a five. An elderly lady 
talking to ears that could not sep- 
arate the words but understood 
the tone. She was telling him to 
use the money for food, to clean 
up and to get hold of himself. He 
would nod continuously as the 
drumming voice went on and then 
he would try to find the person’s 
face so he could stare into it with 
what he hoped was sincerity. 

And say, over and over, “Bless 
you, ma’am, bless you.’* 



She would move away, shaking 
her head to clear her memory and 
her conscience as she left him to 
the endless stream of life. Some- 
how he would stagger erect, 
clenching both hands, since he 
could not be sure which held the 
dollar. His eyes magnetically 
sought out the large and burning 
signs of hope. 

LIQUOR, WINE, BEER, 
DRUGS. 

All would do. 

They no longer gave him 
change or, if they did, he never 
picked it up. The dollar was always 
exchanged for a bottle and an ur- 
gent hand that ushered him from 
the store. He was unable to open 
the bottles, so he would break off 
the necks and drink from the jag- 
ged edges. His lips were heavily 
scarred and scabbed but for his 
purposes it didn’t matter. 

Clutching the bottle to himself, 
he sought out a place where he 
could drink it alone. Fortunately 
companionship wasn’t one of his 
problems. 

T HE smuggling of native fauna 
or flora between any of the 
forty-nine worlds of the Federa- 
tion was a capital crime. The 
dominant philosophy of peaceful 
coexistence was based on a mutual 
need for varying produce, inter- 
world commerce. The Federa- 
tion’s Commerce Department 
monitored and duplicated all rec- 
ords of transactions, subsidies. 



FRUIT OF THE VINE

trends and emergency parities. Its 
police enforced the rules. 

The Spaceports were little more 
than huge warehouse and packag- 
ing complexes where imported 
products were either disinfected 
or sterilized and repackaged for 
in-planet shipping. Perishable 
items were inspected and sealed at 
the port of shipment. 

The immensity of the system 
made it awkward to police, since 
the computers were programed 
to extract corporate smugglings 
for profit on a high-yield basis. 
The efforts of the Entertainers 
took years to detect. The time of 
detection was further compounded 
in that the yield of the first vines 
came years after the initial plant- 
ing occurred and required several 
more years before the fledgling 
industries reached the point of 
being able to export their products. 

After establishing the case, the 
Commerce Department released 
its jurisdiction to the Federal Po- 
lice Agency. The FPA had its own 
problems in that the case lacked 
reason or motive. Years passed be-' 
fore the establishment of two cru- 
cial facts allowed the FPA to pur- 
sue the criminals. 

First, all the smuggled vines 
were of the Earth varieties. There 
were nine planets in the Federa- 
tion that possessed native grapes. 
One, Butus 3, was poisonous to all 
but the natives. All the smug- 
gled grapes were of the Emperor, 



Concord, Ribier and Catawba 
strains. The planting pattern was 
random. Muscat appeared on one 
planet. 

Secondly, the age of the vines, 
the size of the vineyards and the 
development of the industries 
gave the FPA its timetable. A 
search for a profit motive yielded 
nothing. The seeding was done 
more or less in a circle tangential, 
to Earth. The circle was twenty 
years old and nearing completion. 
The FPA sent field teams to the 
last three worlds and hoped they 
had not missed the boat. 

The effort was not merely one 
of saving face and punishing the 
law-breakers. Planetary laws were 
very strict about off-world smug- 
gling but very lenient, if extant, 
concerning on-world smuggling. 
Each world would insist that it had 
developed or discovered the smug- 
gled item and the FPA was power- 
less to destroy the crop or animals 
unless a court conviction^ estab- 
lished their case. So the\vines 
grew and flourished while the 
FPA hunted and waited. 

A FTER three weeks in space, 
when Phobus I appeared on 
the Armeter's wrap-warning 
screen Captain Foster grinned 
from ear to ear. The music on 
board was driving him crazy. It 
wouldn’t have been so bad ex- 
cept that the bum kept singing the 
same song over and over. 



106 



IF 




Foster activated his intercom to 
his officers’ quarters. 

“Phobus on scan. Front and 
center.” 

He heard a hurried, ‘‘Aye-aye 
— ” and muffled sounds of scur- 
rying feet. 

He switched off the communi- 
cator and prepared to set the ship 
down. 

Phobus was a cool planet by 
most standards. Its vegetation re- 
flected purplish hues as the Ar- 
nieter descended. It was a sandy 
world and lacked the huge oceans 
of water common to most Federa- 
tion planets. But its water table 
was high and its solar characteris- 
tics assured a constant season. 

Once the Armeter was on pad 
and clamped in place, Foster di- 
rected Tokay to meet him at the 
portal and personally escorted the 
little Entertainer from the ship. 
The familiar green and blue uni- 
form of a Port Authority Inspector 
waited at the bottom of the glide 
for them to descend. The plainly 
dressed man beside the inspector 
also waited. Badges over each 
breast pocket identified him as an 
FPA agent. 

At the bottom of the ramp, Fos- 
ter gave Tokay a shove toward the 
Inspector. 

‘‘Here’s one you can have with 
my blessings.” 

“Hey, watch it, off-worlder,” 
said Tokay as he stumbled to re- 
gain his balance. Turning to the 
inspector: “Where’s my pals?” 



Seeing that Tokay was an En- 
tertainer, the' inspector returned 
his attention to the board of in- 
voice sheets and hooked a thumb 
over one shoulder toward a build- 
ing marked Port Warehouse, 
Ramp E. Tokay flipped his hand 
from his forehead in a gesture of 
acknowledgment and, as he turned 
to leave, made a more explicit 
finger motion to Foster. 

Entertainers were never 
checked. They only carried what 
was on their backs and all seemed 
to have a peculiar aversion to be- 
ing decontaminated, so that they 
never attempted to leave the 
Ports. People readily avoided their 
company and the Authority con- 
sidered them minimum risks. 

Tokay felt some justification for 
the jerk in his chest when the 
FPA agent said, “Just a minute, 
please.” 

Tokay raised an eyebrow and 
turned to face a scanner being 
used on his back. 

“Yes?” 

The agent motioned to the gui- 
tar. “Let me see that for a mo- 
ment.” Tokay swung the instru- 
ment casually from his shoulder 
and handed it over. The agent ran 
his finger along the seams of the 
instrument, then drew a telescop- 
ing probe from his pocket. He 
pushed the tool between the 
strings and into the well and soon 
was tapping at two partitions on 
both sides of the lower half of the 
sound box. “What’s in these?” 



FRUIT OF THE VINE 



107 




“Bottles,” answered Tokay 
without hesitation. 

The agent handed back the gui- 
tar. 

“Open it up.” 

Tokay turned the guitar over 
and gently pressed the spine just 
beneath the well. The hinged lids 
of the compartments sprang open, 
exposing two long-necked and 
empty bottles. The agent with- 
drew them and checked both for 
Federation Tax and Export stamps 
before setting them aside. 

With an amused smile he asked, 
“Doesn’t that give you bad reso- 
nance?” 

“Not so much. The inner walls 
are just plywood that fall open 
when the compartment is empty. 
This spring on the back is strong 
enough to hold th£ wood togeth- 
er so tightly that the vibrations 
are not interrupted.” 

Tokay snapped the lids shut to 
a resounding hum. 

“Ingenious. Now, step back, 
please.” Tokay stepped back, hold- 
ing his arms out to their extremes. 
When he turned full circle he 
kept his body between the scanner 
and the guitar. The agent nodded. 
“All right. You can go.” 

“What about my bottles?” asked 
Tokay. 

“Confiscated,” answered the 
agent sternly. 

Tokay decided not to push it 
and hurried off.' As he left, he 
could hear the agent explaining to 
the inspector and Foster. 



“Never met one that didn’t 
have a bottle on him somewhere. 
They fill them up again with God 
knows what kind of poison when 
they can’t, buy wine — and that’s 
a crime, you know.” 

M IDWAY across the ramp a 
Butan moved out of nowhere 
and fell in beside the little Enter- 
tainer. 

“I thought you were going to 
need help. I’m Serteze, The 
Searcher here.” 

“It was close. I’m Tokay, The 
Planter. We haven’t met before, 
have we?” 

“No. I was recruited after 
Garm was killed in a warpburn.” 
Tokay swallowed. 

“Oh— I hadn’t heard.” 

He and Garm had planted nine 
worlds together and had shared 
many drinks. 

“Sorry,” said The Searcher. “I 
thought you had heard.” 

Tokay tried to shake away his 
feeling of grief. He thought of the 
FPA and pushed Garm out of his 
mind. The Searcher put a block 
on it that would pass after Tokay 
slept and eased out carefully. It 
was forbidden to enter the mind 
of an Entertainer. 

“Where did the police come 
from?” 

They reached the wall of the 
warehouse. Serteze indicated a 
direction. 

.He said, “The FPA has been 
all over this place for several 



108 



IF 




weeks now. They’ve drugged 
everyone in the Port except us. It’s 
about the vines but I haven’t been 
able to pick up anything positive. I 
think they’re still pretty much in 
the dark. I doubt if they have any 
real suspects or even a clue as to 
where to look.” 

The Searcher’s fingers moved in 
front of him in smooth scanning 
patterns as he walked. 

‘‘They seem to be a little late, 
don’t they?” said Tokay with a 
broad and beaming smile. 

“That’s the beauty of it.” The 
Searcher smiled back as he stop- 
ped before a metal door. “Here 
we are.” 

Tokay stepped through the 
doorway into a narrow hallway 
that opened into a reactor cooling 
chamber of pipes and valves. Be- 
side one of the huge generators a 
group of Entertainers waited. The 
Searcher waved Tokay forward 
and stayed back to feel out the 
area around the hallway. 

Stepping forward, Tokay said, 
“I am Tokay, The Planter.” 

The group beamed and some- 
one handed Tokay a chilled bottle. 

“Fruit of the vine. Planter?” 

The Searcher, satisfied that they 
had not been followed, joined the 
group in time to make the end of 
the second pass. Tokay knew sev- 
eral of the faces and had worked 
with them before on other worlds. 
But attrition had taken its toll 
and there were several new faces. 
Introductions were swift. The ur- 



gent press of affairs was upon all. 

T OKAY expressed the desire to 
be well on his way before 
dawn. He ate hurriedly, then in- 
spected the seeds. A fret was re- 
moved from the middle of the gui- 
tar neck, which broke neatly in 
half, revealing hollows filled with 
little cellophane bags full of 
seeds. Tokay inspected each pack- 
et for mold while Serteze de- 
scribed the conditions of the 
land he had found only two hun- 
dred miles from the Spaceport. 
Dangerously close — but since this 
was the last planting it really 
didn’t matter. Native clothes 
were produced, along with identi- 
fication seals and a Port pass. 
Tokay changed as he listened to 
the intense briefing. The farmers 
who would host him would have a 
vehicle waiting five miles south of 
the Port to transport him to the 
farm. 

Tokay reassembled the neck of 
the guitar, checked the tune of the 
instrument and reset the strings. 

Goodbyes were brief and the 
little musician hurried off with. 
The Searcher, eager to finish his 
mission. 

.As the pair approached the 
huge, triple-trapped gateway of 
the Port, Serteze picked up the 
minds of the guards and locked 
them down. With a pat on the 
back, he sent Tokay scurrying 
among them. Alarms broke loose 
with the intensity of sound of a

starship’s takeoff and The Searcher 
had to bear down extremely hard 
to hold the Port personnel’s 
thoughts to absolute tranquillity. 

The guards continued to march 
their posts without concern and 
were unable to acknowledge the 
flashing red and blue alarm lights 
and the noise. Tokay scampered 
over a distant hill as the first emer- 
gency vehicles rolled up to rein- 
force the gate. The Searcher re- 
laxed and dropped a cloak over 
himself and calmly walked away 
from the scene of confusion. 

I T WAS still snowing — or maybe 
it was snowing again. A police 
car rolled by and the tires made a 
crushing, sucking sound against 
the ice. He was no longer both- 
ered by the police. They only took 
in the ones who could sober up 
and he had long since passed that 
stage. So they left him alone and 
called him Charlie Three. He ig- 
nored them now but they watched 
him just the same. 

The world was two-dimensional 
to him now. Everything was some- 
thing that could be touched or it 
did not exist. The fear of falling 
was gone from him. He knew no 
panic as he pitched forward and 
bounced against the pavement. 
He knew the surface would sup- 
port his body while he waited for 
the pain to subside. 

The snow was cool and soothing 
against his forehead. He felt hot 
even though the ragged Cotton suit 



was his only clothing in the freez- 
ing air. Breathing hurt and the ef- 
fort seemed to make him even 
shorter of breath. Eventually he 
became aware that he was sick 
with a new and different type of 
sickness. He could feel a force wel- 
ling up inside that pushed him to 
try to get help. 

He staggered to his feet and 
stumbled along in the snow, re- 
peating in an unbroken litany, 
“Help me, please — oh, God, it 
hurts. Help me, please, oh, 
God—” 

It had been dark a very long 
time and mo one was on the streets 
to hear the plea. No one to help. 
No one could so it really didn’t 
matter that no one would. 

W HEN a planting was finished 
Tokay would wait outside 
the perimeter of the Port for night 
to fall and forThe Searcher to scan 
his presence. But this was the last 
planting and Tokay was careless to 
the point of walking up to the gate 
carrying his guitar. The guards 
turned to watch his approach. 
Their attention was not normal 
and the chilling realization that he 
had made a mistake broke upon 
The Planter. He licked his lips, 
swallowed his heart and bolted. 

The calls to halt were probably 
given but Tokay was running for 
his life and could hear nothing 
but the blood pounding in his 
ears. A beam grazed his hip and 
flung him to the ground in agony. 




The guards were upon him al- 
most at once and, as he was 
hoisted to his feet, he felt the bite 
of a hypo in his shoulder. The will 
to struggle went out of him. He 
was shoved into the sidecar. Tokay 
did not feel himself pass out. 

Both Searchers waited for the 
scooter to arrive at FPA head- 
quarters. 

Major Porter switched off the 
recorder as Tokay’s voice began to 
stammer and fajter. The drug was 
wearing off and the major waited 
patiently. He had all the informa- 
tion he needed for a conviction of 
the Entertainers. However, he did 
not have the whole truth. His vis- 
itors had carefully seen to that. 

Tokay’s vision came back in 
flashes and he knew his eyes had 
been open. He recognized the 
FPA agent he had met on arrival 
and, remembering the shot in his 
arm, knew he had been drugged. 
His face showed panic when he 
saw the recorder. 

Porter reached forward and 
patted thedevice. 

“It’s all here. Planter. Sorry.” 

Tokay tried to shake off the 
scene but it remained stronger 
than ever. Porter had been drug- 
ged many times to familiarize him 
with the effects on subjects he in- 
terrogated. 

He persisted: “You almost got 
away with it.” / 

“The seeds are planted. What 
happens to me doesn’t matter too 
much,” Tokay said. 



“You’re both noble and stupid. 
Once we take this evidence to 
court we’ll have the authority to 
destroy those plants of yours and 
you’ll be disintegrated along with 
your friends.” 

“And it only took you twenty 
years to catch up,” said Tokay. 
“What gave us away?” 

Porter’s smile passed. He nod- 
ded several times. 

“I’d like to be able to say that 
we outsmarted you but we didn’t. 
Embarrassing, really. It was so 
obvious that we overlooked you 
completely. We had a party one 
evening for FPA personnel. I 
looked for you to play for us, dis- 
overed your absence and then the 
whole thing came crashing down 
on me. Fate beat you, Planter — 
not the FPA.” There was an obvi- 
ous tone of admiration in the 
agent’s voice and Tokay fought 
back an impulse to warm to the 
man. He looked at the ceiling, 
shrugged and made no sound. 
“Tell me one thing. Planter,” 
Porter continued. “Why did you 
do it? Why spend twenty years of 
your life planting grape vines? 
Knowing you’d' be caught — know- 
ing the penalty was death — what 
was in it for you?” 

“You wouldn’t understand. 
Your kind never does,” Tokay an- 
swered slowly. 

“Try me.” 

Tokay met Porter’s gaze and 
held it. 

“All right. I’ll try. The reasons 



FRUIT OF THE VINE 



111 




are subjective and they require 
feeling to be understood. A man 
of law can’t have much feeling.” 

It was Porter’s turn to stare 
silently and wait. Tokay rubbed 
his hands together in concentra- 
tion, trying to find words. 

“Man evolved as a part of the 
natural order of things. And every- 
thing had a balance, a design, a 
reason it was as it should be. Came 
civilization with its society and its 
law. Man learned to own things 
— even other men. He became 
greedy and possessive. Some of us 
still believe no one can own any- 
thing without upsetting nature’s 
balance. Own land? Own water or 
air or animals — and even whole 
worlds? We believe that each man 
has a born need for and a right to 
life’s gifts, all of them. Do you see 
what I’m trying to say?” 

Porter nodded. “Sure. You’re 
saying that in matters dealing with 
natural resources man is above the 
law. Isn’t that about it?” 

Tokay raised his hands in frus- 
tration and sank backward in his 
chair. “In your language — and 
above some laws. I’m saying that a 
law that forbids free exchange of 
animals and plants solely for pur- 
poses^ commerce is wrong. The 
law in itself is a crime against man. 
We have been freeing your 
worlds.” 

The agent smiled. 

“Crime is a word of law, Plant- 
er. It cannot be that a law is a 
crime — that would be a paradox. 



The laws of trade and commerce 
in our system have prevented war 
and negating them is your crime 
against man. You have — in a minor 
way to be sure — threatened the 
peace and must pay.” 

Tokay’s fist slammed down on 
the agent’s desk. His eyes flashed. 

He yelled, “Greed brings war. 
Inequality brings war. Helpless- 
ness and hopelessness bring war. 
And by damn, Porter, idiots bring 
war.” 

“A simple fanatic, that’s all you 
are. A simple fanatic, And I 
thought you had a reason for all 
this.” Porter shook his head. “In 
your small way, Planter, you have 
failed,” he said with finality and 
reached to call his guards. 

He did not see the paperweight 
slide from his desk and ascend be- 
hind his back. The sudden motion 
almost sparked a cry of warning 
from the startled Tokay but he 
managed to bite it off. 

The weapon descended and 
Porter pitched out across his desk 
top. A blood-speckled bruise ap- 
peared on his forehead. Serteze 
and Garm appeared simulta- 
neously. 

“Garm — ” whispered Tokay in 
disbelief. 

“The reports of the death of 
Garm have been greatly exagger- 
ated as they say.” The Seacher 
grinned as he removed the re- 
corder’s capsule and slipped it in- 
to his tunic.

J. R. PIERCE 



T HE Prime Minister glanced at 
his appointment schedule and 
then at the visitor his secretary 
conducted into his office. Here was 
a soldier, he thought. Tall, strong, 
young and obviously enthusiastic. 
“General Devlin, D. I. A., Mr. 



Prime Minister.” The secretary in- 
troduced the visitor and withdrew. 

“Special briefing on the Panda 
War, Mr. Prime Minister,” Dev- 
lin said as they shook hands. 

The hellburn of Devlin’s hand- 



113 




some features looked very much 
like suntan and the initials of his 
office. Demon In Attendance, 
coincided happily with those of 
the Defense Intelligence Agency. 

“You may call me ‘sir,’ son,” 
the Prime Minister told Devlin as 
they sat down. “We’re all soldiers 
in this war.” He looked gravely at 
Devlin, his features taking on a 
kindly, sorrowful cast. “Bad news, 
is it?” 

“A troubled situation, sir,” 
Devlin replied, “but full of oppor- 
tunity. You’ll want to hear the de- 
tails first. Colonel MacReady will 
brief you on the military situa- 
tion.” 

Devlin turned to the office door 
and the Prime Minister followed 
his gaze. 

The spruce, middle-aged figure 
in the doorway had not passed the 
secretary. It was a phantasm. Hell 
does not have demons in unlimited 
supply. The chimeras which 
threaten saints and the succubi 
who tempt them are largely illu- 
sory. They are the product at once 
of a demon’s art and of the imag- 
ination of the tempted. 

In their place, phantasmagoria 
are more than a substitute fof de- 
mons — they are a flexible weapon 
of great subtlety. Thus, “Colonel 
MacReady” told the Prime Min- 
ister what Devlin felt it necessary 
for him to hear but, beyond that, 
responded to the Prime Minister’s 
knowledge and fears. Never before 
had a briefing spoken so well to 



his particular condition of mind. 

The rapport persisted and 
strengthened as other phantasms 
told the Prime Minister what he 
expected to hear concerning the 
villages, the provincial adminis- 
trations, the government in 
Harum, the Panda capital, the 
political situation and the exact 
status of the growing force of mil- 
itary advisors. 

The last of the phantasms left 
him with a forbidding picture. 

“So, the villages — ” the Prime 
Minister began. 

“Are dominated by the enemy,” 
Devlin said. 

“The provincial administra- 
tions—” 

“Are collecting taxes and ignor- 
ing both the enemy and the.central 
government.” 

“The strong points — ” 

“Are illusory.” 

“And the government we have 
supported to avoid this — ” 

“Is determined but incapable 
of acting and beset by an unsym- 
pathetic majority,” Devlin con- 
cluded. “But their failure need not 
be our failure — or the failure of 
the Pandas.” 

A light of expectant eagerness 
broke through the Prime Minis- 
ter’s expression of soulful resigna- 
tion. 

“What more do you propose?” 
he asked sharply. 

“Sir, do we support the present 
Panda government or the cause of 
the people;?” Devlin asked. 



114 



IF 




“We’ve always told Dang that 
he has our support,” the Prime 
Minister said. “I sort of like him 
because he’s tough; But we’ve 
given him enough supplies to fin- 
ish off anyone who opposes him 
anywhere. And they turn up in the 
hands of the enemy.” The expres- 
sion of benevolent concern re- 
turned to the face of the Prime 
Minister. “Whatever we have told 
Dang — our duty is of course to the 
Pandas,” he said. “Anyone can 
see — will see — that our promises 
were meant in that sense. The 
Pandas must not suffer. Certainly 
not because of any commitments 
given to an ineffective government 
on their behalf. As for Dang — ” 

“If we do no more for Dang — ” 
Devlin said. 

“Someone will,” the Prime 
Minister concluded, shaking his 
head sadly. 

“And sir,” Devlin added, “giv- 
ing our support to the unsympa- 
thetic majority will show that we 
act neither through religious prej- 
udice nor through selfish bias.” 

The Prime Minister . said, 
“There are good men of all faiths. 
I suppose that the Foreign Office 
will tell me the' names of the new 
government?” 

“I suppose so, sir,” Devlin an- 
swered, rising to go. 

The Prime Minister rose also, 
put his hand on Devlin’s shoulder 
and walked to the door with him. 

“Mine is a heavy burden,” he 
said. 



DRY RUN 



“I know it is, sir,” Devlin 
agreed, quietly and solemnly. 

“And a mao needs all the sup- 
port — loyal support — that comes 
his way. You’ve lightened my bur- 
den today.” A note of campaign- 
ing came into his voice. “We need 
everyone’s help,” he said, smiling 
encouragingly at Devlin. “It’s up 
to every loyal man to do his part. 
We need consensus. We need sup- 
port. We need votes. Every friend. 
Every organization. You work and 
your friends, your associates work, 
I’m sure.” 

“We’re all for you, every one,” 
Devlin assured him. 

The Prime Minister gripped 
Devlin’s shoulder, released it and 
grasped his hand. 

“You’re the kind we need,” he 
said. “I’ll see you again?” 

“Many times, I hope, sir,” Dev- 
lin replied. 

“Any time, any time — ” the 
Prime Minister told him. 

He returned to his desk and 
looked at the next name on his 
schedule. 

S OMEHOW getting rid of 
Dang did not resolve the Pan- 
da situation. When Devlin came to 
the Prime Minister’s office again 
several Panda governments had 
succeeded one another and • the 
military advisors had become a 
fighting army. 

He greeted Devlin warmly — if 
sadly — and listened to the precise 
briefings of the phantasms with 

115 




gloomy appreciation. Then he ad- 
dressed Devlin expectantly. 

“The government — ” he said. 

“Is ineffective,’’ Devlin replied. 

“The people — ” 

“The people are harassed by the 
enemy and they suffer when we 
attack the enemy in their midst,” 
Devlin told him. 

“The enemy — ” 

“Is effective and elusive, sir.” 

A pregnant pause ensued. 

“Sir, the enemy must be coun- 
tered in his homeland,” Devlin 
proposed. “We must stop the flow 
of supplies. It’s the only way to 
spare our troops and our Pandas.” 

“The war hasn’t been carried 
outside of Panda,” mused the 
Prime Minister. “Would our peo- 
ple accept it if we did?" 

“But the enemy has extended 
the war, sir,” Devlin insisted. 

“How’s that?” asked the Prime 
Minister alertly. 

“He attacked us on the high 
seas,” Devlin insisted. 

“Oh, yes,” the Prime Minister 
agreed. “Something like" that did 
happen. We sank two of his boats. 
Well, he extended the war. Let 
him suffer the consequences. I 
don’t suppose that anyone would 
try a sneak attack here?” 

“Not a chance, sir.” 

“But I do suppose that the ene- 
my’s cities and towns will be de- 
stroyed—” 

“They will be,” Devlin assured 
him, “incidental to the destruction 
of his supply lines.” 



“It hurts me that any human 
life must be lost,” the Prime Min- 
ister said sadly. “But the wicked 
bring destruction on themselves. 
‘He who lives by the sword — ’” he 
quoted grimly. 

“Will die by the sword.” 

“I wonder if tl|e Panda religion 
teaches that?” the Prime Minister 
said. “I bear no ill will toward the 
enemy.” 

Devlin nodded seriously. 

“Who will die,” the Prime Min- 
ister continued, with an expression 
of pained righteousness. 

Devlin nodded again. 

“That our poor Pandas may be 
free,” the Prime Minister con- 
cluded. 

They both sat quietly for a mo- 
ment. The Prime Minister con- 
tinued to look gravely benevolent. 

“I can always use loyal help,” 
the Prime Minister reminded Dev- 
lin as he left. 

Devlin admired the Prime Min- 
ister’s appearance on TV the fol- 
lowing week, when he explained 
the new phase of the Panda war. 
The message carried a nation with' 
it but the enemy remained uncon- 
vinced. Some time later Devlin 
was back again. The briefing went 
as before. At its end the Prime 
Minister spoke. 

“The bombing — ” 

“Is as destructive as we ex- 
pected but is less effective than it 
would have been in a civilized 
country,” Devlin told him. 

“The government — ” 



116 



IF 




“Still cannot carry the burden 
of the war.” 

“The villages — ” 

“Are terrorized into supplying 
the enemy.” 

The Prime Minister looked 
both sadly resigned and warily 
expectant. 

“Our obligation is not to any 
Panda government,” Devlin 
said. 

“No,” the Prime Minister said. 
“We have agreed on that.” 

“Nor Panda goods or territory,” 
Devlin continued. 

The Prime Minister nodded. 

“But to the future welfare of the 
Pandas themselves,” Devlin said. 

The Prime Minister waited si- 
lently. 

“We can save the Pandas and 
destroy the resources of the ene- 
my,” Devlin asserted. 

“How?” the Prime Minister 
asked eagerly. 

“By razing the Pandas villages 
and destroying their fields and 
livestock,” Devlin pronounced.- 

“I see,” the Prime Minister 
said approvingly. “Instead of the 
Pandas supporting the enemy, we 
will support the Pandas. We will 
house those poor refugees of war 
in model camps — ” 

“In model resettlement areas, 
eventually,” Devlin said, “where 
they will have modern housing and 
sanitation, nutritious food and 
advanced medical care.” 

“They will be given all the ad- 
vantages of civilization,” the 



Prime Minister said warmly. 

“They will have fields and live- 
stock, new implements and pat- 
terns of farming,” Devlin con- 
tinued. 

“Eventually,” the Prime Min- 
ister interrupted. “That will come 
eventually — Right now we must 
fix it so there’s nothing for the en- 
emy to confiscate. Not an animal, 
not a grain of rice, not even a 
blade of grass shall be left.” 

“Of course,” he added, “we 
must evacuate the countryside 
first wherever we can. But we must 
be thorough. It’s the only way to 
save the Panda way of life. And 
people in this country are getting 
tired of our casualties. They want 
action.” 

“We all suffer with you sir,” 
Devlin said as he left. 

I N HIS address to the nation the 
Prime Minister dwelt with sor- 
row and compassion on the plight 
of the Pandas, the danger to the 
nation and the self-sacrifice of its 
dedicated soldiers. He predicted 
some eventual end to the obduracy 
of the enemy. But other public 
commentators dwelled on destruc- 
tion, wounds and death in enemy 
cities, in the Panda countryside 
and in military camps and hospi- 
tals. The nation had become be- 
wildered by the protracted conflict 
into which it had poured its trea- 
sure, a conflict so far away and yet 
so destructive of what was near 
near and dear. People suffered but

117 




their suffering was no longer in 
sympathy with that of the Prime 
Minister. He was cheered to see 
Devlin again and to be briefed as 
before. 

“The enemy — ” he said. 

“Suffers increasing losses,” 
Devlin said. 

The Prime Minister shook his 
head in wonder. 

“Our people — ” 

“Do not appreciate your sacri- 
fices,” Devlin told him softly. 

The Prime Minister looked at 
Devlin directly. 

“History?” he inquired. 

“I’m afraid that’s too much to 
expect, sir,” Devlin told him. 
“You would never agree to pay 
the price.” 

“No,” the Prime Minister said. 
“I wouldn’t. I deserve recognition 
and approval and comfort right 
now. Wars have mostly been pop- 
ular. I met a challenge to our way 
of life — and to the Pandas’, of 
course. Everything has gone 
wrong. I can’t blame myself. I 
won’t wait for justification and I 
won’t lose what I still have. What 
I did must remain right and the 
best anyone could have done. I 
had more important things on my 
mind than the Pandas. The war 
got out of control. I may have lost 
my place in history. I don’t enjoy 
office any more. People don’t suf- 
fer with me any more. They go 
out of their way to make my life 
miserable. If I don’t watch out 
I’ll lose my peace of mind.” 



The Prime Minister stared into 
space, more in anger than in sor- 
row. 

“You can — ” Devlin began. 

“Keep my peace of mind,” the 
Prime Minister completed. 

“By — ” Devlin tried to inter- 
rupt. 

“Resigning from office,” the 
Prime Minister continued. 

“First you can — ” 

“Agree to the enemy’s chief de- 
mand.” 

“And when deescalation seems 
imminent — ” 

“We’ll clobber him good on the 
ground,” the Prime Minister said 
with satisfaction. 

“That will — ” Devlin began. 

“Leave the problem in the 
hands of my successor.” 

“Who will carry on your work — 
with* our support. While you re- 
tire to the country — ” 

“To live among neighbors who 
are friends.” 

“With the satisfaction — ” Dev- 
lin started to say. 

“Of a job well done. No — ” the 
Prime Minister interrupted him- 
self, “With the consciousness of 
having met challenges with forti- 
tude and wisdom and having 
suffered evil in sorrow, not anger.” 

Devlin left the office unnoticed, 
while the Prime Minister smiled 
at a pleasant future, content in his 
dearly purchased peace of mind. 

D EVLIN felt uneasy when he 
approached his superior. He 



118 



IF 




was uneasier still when he had 
given his report. 

“The immediate reward for the 
things I suggested was always 
clear,” he said. 

His superior nodded. 

“He always did what I sug- 
gested,” Devlin said. 

Another nod. 

“The advantages proved illu- 
sory, yet he came back for more.” 

Nod. 

“Yet I felt — I felt that I never 
really had to tempt him,” Devlin 
proposed. 

Another nod. 

“And in the end — well, sir, he 
got ahead of me. I didn’t even 
have to suggest. He said what I 
came prepared to say. “What did 
I do wrong, sir?” Devlin asked 
anxiously. “My own fall wasn’t 
like that at all.” 

“Nothing wrong, Devlin,” his 
superior assured him. “The plan 
was straightforward and no one 
could have carried it through bet- 
ter than you did. You went by the 
book. That’s what an inexperi- 
enced demon should do. By the 
way, we’ll assign someone else to 



his successor.” He looked at Dev- 
lin kindly. “We’ll give you a real 
challenge next time,” he said. “A 
well-brought-up child with a 
cookie jar or a self-interested man 
with a friend. You can try your 
ingenuity there, if you wish.” 

“But it was a success, sir, wasn’t 
it?” Devlin asked anxiously. “The 
Prime Minister gave in — well, he 
followed the script every time. 
We’ll have his immortal soul, 
won’t we, sir?” 

Devlin’s superior smiled con- 
descendingly. 

“I’m afraid not, Devlin,” he 
said. “I hope you won’t be too 
disappointed.” 

“But why, sir, why?” a dis- 
tressed Devlin asked. 

“You see, Devlin,” his mentor 
told him, “immortal souls are too 
valuable to chance missing. A de- 
mon may botch his first job and 
we can’t afford to lose by that. 
That’s why we’ve assigned another 
tyro to the new Prime Minister. 
Not everyone has an immortal 
soul. So, we send new demons on 
a dry run before we let them tackle 
the real thing.” •

Jorj X. McKie, Saboteur Extra- 
ordinary of the Bureau of Sabo- 
tage of the Confederated Sentients, 
is called to the planet of Cordiality 
on an urgent mission — a Caleban 
Beachball has been sighted on the 
planet. 

McKie arrives on Cordiality via 
a jumpdoor — an instantaneous 
space-travel medium controlled by 
the mysterious Calebans — and is 
briefed on the emergency by fellow 
BuSab agent, Alicheno Furuneo. 
Calebans, sentient members of the 
Con-Sentients, have lately been 
disappearing, with disastrous ef- 
fects on humans and other sen- 
tients around them. It is thought 



121 



that Mlis Abnethe, an enormously 
wealthy and beautiful but unscrup- 
ulous human woman is somehow 
involved in the disappearances. 

No one has ever seen a Caleban 
and few have successfully commu- 
nicated with one. • McKie forces 
an entry into the Beachball 
stranded on Cordiality and con- 
fronts the Caleban domiciled in 
it. He succeeds in establishing 
communication with the Caleban, 
a pure energy sentient, who com- 
municates from mind to mind 
and tells him that Mlis Abnethe is 
indeed involved in the inexplicable 
goings on.' Mlis is a flagellator, 
who has acquired a contractual 
right to have the Caleban whipped 
for her pleasure — in return she has 
promised certain educational ad- 
vantages for Calebans. McKie 
witnesses and interrupts one of 
the flagellations, discovers that 
the Caleban, who has assumed the 
name Fanny Mae, has fallen in 
love with him. 

McKie, a veteran of fifty-four 
unsuccessful marriages, is unim- 
pressed, but utilizes the fact that 
the universality of love permits 
Fanny Mae to violate her con- 
tract with Mlis Abnethe and send 
him on her trail via a jumpdoor. 

He emerges from the jump- 
door on an unfamiliar planet, 
talking to an uncommunicative 
rock.

W HIP and severed Palenki 
arm arrived at the proper 
BuSab laboratory while it was 
temporarily unoccupied. The lab 



chief, Treey Tuluk, a back- 
bowing Wreave, was away at 
the time, attending the confer- 
ence McKie’s report had precip- 
itated. 

As with most back-bowers, Tu- 
luk was an odor-id Wreave. He 
had an outwardly average Wre5ve 
body, two-and-a-half meters tall, 
tubular, pedal bifurcation, verti- 
cal face slit with manipulative ex- 
tensors dangling from the lower 
corner. From long association with 
humans and humanoids he had 
developed a brisk, slouching gait, 
a predilection for clothing with 
pockets and unWreavish speech 
mannerisms of a cynical tone. The 
four eye tubes protruding from the 
top of his facial slit were green and 
mild. 

Returning from the conference, 
he recognized the objects on his 
lab floor immediately. They 
matched Siker’s description. Tu- 
luk complained to himself briefly 
about the careless manner of de- 
livery and soon was lost in the in- 
tricacies of examination. He and 
the assistants he summoned made 
initial holoscans before separating 
whip and arm. 

As they had expected, the Palen- 
ki gene structure offered no com- 
paratives. The arm had not come 
from one of the few Palenkis on 
record in the ConSentient Regis- 
ter. Tuluk filed the DNA chart 
and message sequence, however. 
These could be used to identify the 
arm’s original owner if that be- 
came necessary. 

Study of the whip went ahead. 
The artifact report came out of 
the computers as “Bullwhip, copy 



122 



IF 




of ancient earth type.” It was made 
of steerhide. The fact gave Tuluk 
and his vegetarian aides a moment 
of disgust. 

“A sick archaism,” one of Tu- 
luk’s Chither assistants called the 
whip. The others agreed with this 
judgment, even a Pan Spechi, for 
whom periodic reversion to carni- 
vorous type in his creche cycle was 
necessary to survival. 

A curious alignment in some of 
the cell molecules next attracted 
their attention. Study of whip and 
arm continued at their respective 
paces. 

M CKIE took the long-distance 
call while standing beside a 
dirt road about three kilometers 
from the rock. He had come this 
far on foot, increasingly annoyed 
by the strange surroundings. The 
city, he had soon discovered, was a 
mirage hanging over a dusty plain 
of tall grass and scrubby thorn- 
bushes. 

It was almost as hot on the plain 
as it had been in the Caleban’s 
Beachbalk ' 

So far the only living things he 
had seen were some distant tawny 
animals and countless insects — 
leapers, crawlers, fliers, hoppers. 
The road contained two parallel 
indentations and was the rusty red 
color, of abandoned iron. It 
seemed to originate in a far away 
line of blue hills and plunge 
straight across the- plain to the 
heat-muddled horizon. The road 
contained no occupant except 
himself. Not even a dust cloud 
marked some hidden passage. 
McKie was almost glad to feel 



the sniggertrance grip him. 

“This is Tuluk,” nis caller said. 
“I was told to contact you as soon 
as I had anything to report. Hope- 
fully, I intrude at an opportune 
moment.” 

McKie, who had a journeyman’s 
respect for Tuluk’s. competence, 
said: “Let’s have it.” 

“Not much on the arm,” Tuluk 
said. “Palenki, of course. We can 
identify the original owner if we 
ever get him. There has been at 
least one previous-regrowth of this 
member. Sword cut on the fore- 
arm, by the look of it.” 

“What about the Phylum mark- 
ings?” 

“We’re still checking that.” 

“The whip?” 

“That’s something else. It’s real 
steerhide.” 

“Real?” 

“No doubt of it. We could iden- 
tify the original owner of the skin, 
although I doubt it’s walking 
around anywhere.” 

“You’ve a gruesome sense of 
humor. What else?” 

“The whip’s an archaism, too. 
Bullwhip, ancient earth style. We 
got an original ID by computer 
and brought in a museum expert 
for confirmation. He thought the 
construction was a bit on the crude 
side but close enough to leave little 
doubt it was a copy of a real ori- 
ginal. Fairly recent manufacture, 
too.” 

“Where could they get an orig- 
inal to copy?” 

“We’re checking that and it may 
provide a lead. These things aren’t 
too common.” 

“Recent manufacture,” McKie

said. “Are you sure about that?” 

“The animal from which that 
hide was removed has been dead 
about two standard years. Intra- 
cellular structure was still reactive 
to catalyzing.” 

“Two years. Where would they 
get a real steer?” 

“That narrows it down. There 
are some around for story props 
in the various entertainment me- 
dia, that sort of thing. A few of the 
outback planets where they haven’t 
the technology for pseudoflesh 
still raise cattle for food.” 

“This thing gets more confusing 
the deeper we go into it.” McKie 
said. 

“That’s what we think. Oh, 
by the way, there’s chalf dust on the 
whip.” 

“Chalf! That’s where I got the 
yeast smell!” 

“Yes, it’s still quite strong.” 

“What would they be doing 
with that much quick-scribe 
powder?” McKie asked. “There 
was no sign of a chalf-memory 
stick — but that means little, of 
course.” 

“It’s just a suggestion,” Tuluk 
said, “but they could’ve chalf- 
scribed that design on the Palen- 
ki.” 

“Why?” 

“Give it a false Phylum, may- 
be?” 

“Perhaps.” 

“If you smelled chalf after the 
whip came through, there’d have to 
be quite a bit of it around. You 
thought of that?” 

“The room wasn’t all that big 
and it was hot.” 

“The heat would explain it, all 



right. Sorry we didn’t have more 
for you.” 

“That’s all?” 

“Well, it might not be of any use 
— but the whip has been stored in a 
hanging position, supported by a 
thin length of steel.” 

“Steel? Are you positive?” 
“Positive.” 

“Who still uses steel?” 

“It’s not all that uncommon on 
some of the newer planets. R&R 
has even turned up places where 
they build with it.” 

“Wild.” 

“Isn’t it, though?” 

“You know,” McKie said, 
“we’re looking for an outback 
planet and that’s where I seem to 
be.” 

“Where are you?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“You don’t know?” 

McKie explained his predica- 
ment. 

“You field agents take awful 
chances.” 

“Don’t we?” 

“You wear a monitor. I could 
ask this Taprisiot to identify your 
location. Want to invoke the moni- 
tor clause?” 

“You know that’s an open pay- 
ment clause,” McKie. said. “1 
don’t think this is as yet a suffi- 
cient emergency for me to risk 
bankrupting us. Let me see if I can 
identify this place by other means.’.’ 
“What do you want me to do 
next?” 

“Call Furuneo. Have him allow 
me another.six hours, then get the 
Caleban to pick me up.” 

“Pick you up, right. Siker said 
you were onto some doorless 



124 



IF 




S’eye thine. Can it pick you up 
anywhere? ,r 
“I think so.” 

“1*11 call Furuneo right away.” 

M CKIE had been walking for 
almost two hours before he 
saw the smoke. Thin spirals of it 
stood in the air against the back- 
drop of distant blue hills. 

It had occurred to McKie dur- 
ing his walk that, he might have 
been set down in a place where he 
could die of thirst or starvation be- 
fore his legs carried him to the safe 
companionship of his civilized fel- 
lows. A self-accusatory morose- 
ness had overtaken him. This was 
not the first time he had realized 
that some accident of the machin- 
ery he took for granted might 
prove fatal. 

But the machinery of his own 
mind? He cursed himself for using 
the Caleban’s S’eye system this way 
when he knew the unreliability of 
communication with the creature. 
Walking! 

You never thought ydu might 
have to walk to safety. 

McKie 'sensed the eternal flaw 
in sentient relationship with ma- 
chinery. Reliance on such forces 
put your muscles at a disadvan- 
tage in a universe where you might 
liave to rely on them at any time. 

He seemed to be getting nearer 
to the smoke, although the hills 
looked as remote as ever. 

Walking. 

Of all the stupid, damned foul- 
ups. Why would Abnethe pick a 
place like this to start her kinky 
little game? If this were the place 
it had started. If the Caleban had 



not made another communica- 
tion error. 

If love could find a way. What 
the devil did love have to do with 
all this? 

McKie plodded on, wishing he 
had brought some water. First the 
heat of the Beachball, now this. 
His throat felt as though he had 
built a fire in it. The dust kicked up 
by his feet did not help. Every step 
stirred up a puff of pale red from 
the narrow track. The dust clogged 
his throat and nostrils. It had a 
musty taste. 

He patted the toolkit in his jack- 
et pocket. The raygen could burn 
a thin hole in this parched earth, 
might even strike down to water. 
But how could he bring the water 
up to his demanding throat? 

Plenty of insects around. They 
buzzed and flew about, crawled 
at the edge of the track, attempted 
at times to alight on his exposed 
flesh. He finally took to carrying 
his toolkit’s stim like a fan, setting 
it at medium potency. It cleared 
the air around his face whenever a 
swarm approached, dropped jitter- 
ing patches of stunned insects be- 
hind him. 

He grew aware of a noise — low, 
indistinct booming. Something be- 
ing pounded. Something hollow 
and resonant. It originated out 
there in the distance -where the 
smoke stood on the air. 

It could be a natural phenome- 
non, McKie told himself. Could be 
wild creatures. The smoke might 
be natural fires. Still, he brought 
the raygen from his kit, kept it in a 
sidepocket where he could get at it 
quickly. 



WHIPPING STAR 



125 




The noise became louder in slow 
stages, as though it were being am- 
plified to mark consecutive posi- 
tions of his approach. Screens of 
thornbush and gentle undulations 
in the plain concealed the source. 

McKie trudged up a gentle rise, 
still following the road. 

Sadness transfixed him. He’d 
been cast away on some poverty- 
stricken backyard world, a place 
that stiffened the eyes. He had been 
given a role in a story with a mor- 
al, a clipped-wing fairy story. He 
was a burned-out wanderer, his 
thirst a burnished yearning. An- 
guish had lodged in him some- 
where. He pursued an estranged, 
plodding dream which would dis- 
solve in the awakening doom of a 
single Caleban. 

The toll that Caleban’s death 
would bring oppressed him. It 
turned his ego upside down and 
drained out all the lightness. His 
own death would be a lost bubble 
burst in such a conflagration. 

McKie shook his head to drive 
away such thoughts. Fear would 
pluck him of all sensibility. He 
couldn’t afford it. 

One thing was sure now — the 
sun was setting. It had descended 
at least two widths toward the hor- 
izon since he had started this stu- 
pid trek. 

What in the -name of the infinite 
devils was that drumming? It came 
at him as though riding the heat: 
monotonous, insistent. He felt his 
temples throbbing to an irritating 
counterpoint. 

M CKIE topped the low rise, 
stopped. He stood at the brim 



of a shallow basin which had been 
cleared of the thornbush. At the 
basin’s center a thorn fence en- 
closed twenty or so conical huts 
with grass roofs. They appeared to 
be made of mud. Smoke spiraled 
from holes in several of the roofs 
and from pit fires outside others. 
Black dots of cattle grazed in the 
basin, lifting their heads occasion- 
ally with stubby whiskers of brown 
grass protruding from their 
mouths. 

Black-skinned youths carrying 
long poles watched the cattle. 
More black-skinned men, women 
and children went about various 
occupations within the thorn en- 
closure. 

McKie, whose ancestry con- 
tained blacks from the planet 
Caoleh, found the scene curiously 
disturbing. It touched a genetic 
memory that vibrated to a wrong 
rhythm. Where in the universe 
could people be degraded to such 
primitive living standards? The 
basin was like a textbook scene 
from the dark ages of ancient 
Earth. 

The children were mostly naked, 
as were some of the men. The 
women wore string skirts. 

Could this be some odd return 
to nature? 

The narrow track led down into 
the basin and through the thorn 
fence, extending out the other side 
to disappear over a bordering 
crest. 

McKie began the descent. He 
hoped to find water in this village. 
The booming noise came from a 
large hut near the center of the 
cluster. A two-wheeled cart with 



126 



IF 




four great two-horned beasts 
yoked to it waited beside the hut. 

McKie studied the cart as he ap- 
proached. Between its high side- 
walls were piled jumbles of strange 
artifacts — flat, boardlike things, 
rolls of garish fabric, long poles 
with sharp metal tips. 

The drumming stopped and 
McKie noted that he had been 
seen. Children ran screaming 
among the huts, pointing at him. 
Adults turned with slow dignity, 
studied him. 

Silence settled oyer the scene. 
McKie entered the village through 
a break in the thorn fence. Emo- 
tionless black faces turned to ob- 
serve his progress. Scents assaulted 
McKie’s nostrils — rotting flesh, 
dung, gave off acrid stenches 
whose character he didn’t care to 
explore in connection with the 
smells of woodsmoke and burn- 
ing meat. 

. Clouds of black insects swarmed 
about the beasts yoked to the cart 
beside the central hut. A red- 
bearded white man emerged from 
the hut as McKie approached. T^he 
man wore a flat-brimmed hat, a 
dusty black jacket and dun pants. 
He carried a whip of the same pat- 
tern the Palenki had used. Seeing 
the whip, McKie knew he had 
come to the right place. 

The man waited in the doorway, 
a mean-eyed, menacing figure, 
thin lips visible through the beard. 
He glanced once at McKie, nodded 
at several of the black men off to 
McKie’s left, motioned toward the 
cart, returned his attention to 
McKie. 

Two tall blade men moved to 



stand at the head of the yoked 
beasts. 

McKie studied the contents of 
the cart. The boardlike objects, he 
saw, had been carved and painted 
with strange designs. They re- 
minded him of Palenki carapaces. 
He didn’t like the way the two men 
at the head of the yoked beasts 
stared at him. Danger lurked here. 
McKie kept his right hand in his 
jacket pocket, curled around the 
raygen tube. He felt and saw the 
black residents closing in behind 
him. His back felt exposed and 
vulnerable. 

“I am Jorj X. McKie, Saboteur 
Extraordinary,” he said, stopping 
about ten paces from the bearded 
white man. ‘‘And you?” 

The man spat in the dust, said 
something that sounded like: 
“Getnabent.” 

McKie swallowed. He did not 
recognize the greeting. Strange, he 
thought. He had not believed the 
ConSentiency contained a lan- 
guage completely unfamiliar to 
him. Perhaps R&R had come up 
with a new planet. 

‘‘I am on an official mission of 
the Bureau,” McKie said. ‘‘Let all 
'men know this.” 

That satisfied the legalities. 

The bearded man glanced in the 
direction of the voice, back to 
McKie. 

McKie shifted his attention to 
the whip. The man trailed the end 
of it behind him on the ground. 
Seeing McKie’s attention, he 
flicked a wrist, caught the flexible 
end of the whip in two fingers 
which he lifted from the handle. 
He continued to stare at McKie. 



WHIPPING STAR 



127 




There was a casual proficiency 
in the way the man handled the 
whip that sent a shudder through 
McKie. “Where did you get that 
whip?” he asked. 

The man looked at the object in 
his hand. “Pitsch,” he sajd. “Braw- 
zhenbuller.” 

McKie moved closer, held out a 
hand for the whip. 

The bearded man shook his head 
from side to side, scowled. No 
mistaking that answer. 

“Maykely,” he said. 

He tapped the butt of the whip 
handle against the side of the cart, 
nodded at the piled cargo. 

Once more McKie studied the 
contents of the cart. Handmade 
artifacts — no doubt of it. There 
could be a big profit in esoteric and 
decorative objects, he knew. These 
could be artifacts that curried to 
the buyer boredom brought on by 
the endless, practical, serial dupli- 
cations from automatic factories. 
If they were manufactured in this 
village, though, the whole opera- 
tion looked to be a slave labor 
thing. Or serfdom, which was the 
same thing to all practical pur- 
poses. 

Abnethe’s game might have 
sicker overtones but more under- 
standable motives. 

“Where’s Mliss Abnethe?” he 
asked. 

That brought a response. The 
bearded man jerked up his head, 
glared at McKie. The surround- 
ing mob emitted unintelligible 
cry. 

“Abnethe?” McKie asked. 

“Seeawss Abnethe,” the bearded 
man said. 



The crowd around them began 
chanting: “Epah Abnethe! Epah 
Abnethe! Epah Abnethe — ” 

“Rooik!” the bearded man 
shouted. 

The chant stopped abruptly. 

“What is tlje name of this plan- 
et?” McKie asked. He glanced 
around at the staring black faces. 
“Where is this place?” 

No one answered. 

McKie locked eyes with the 
bearded man. The other returned 
his stare in a predatory, measuring 
manner, nodded once, as though 
he’d come to some conclusion. 

“Deespawng!” he said. 

McKie frowned, swore under 
his breath. This damned case pre- 
sented communications difficulties 
at every turn! No matter. He’d 
seen enough here to demand a full- 
scale investigation by a police 
agency. You didn’t keep humans 
in this primitive state. Abnethe 
must be behind this place. The 
whip, the reaction to her name. 
The village smelled of Abnethe 
sickness. McKie observed some of 
the people across from him, saw 
scars on their arms and chests. 
Whip scars? If they were, Ab- 
nethe’s money wouldn’t save her. 

Something exploded against the 
back of McKie’s neck, knocking, 
him forward. The bearded man 
raised the whip handle and McKie 
saw the thing rushing toward his 
head. Jle felt a giant darkness 
lurch across his mind as the thing 
crashed against the side of his 
head. He tried to bring the raygen 
out of his pocket but muscles dis- 
obeyed. He felt his body become a 
limping, horrified stagger. His 



128 



IF 




vision was by then a bloody haze. 

Again something exploded 
against his head. 

McKie sank into nightmare ob- 
livion. As he sank, he thought of 
the monitor in his skull. If they 
had killed him, a Taprisiot some- 
where would jerk to attention and 
send in a final report on one Joij 
X. McKie. 

A lot ojgood that’ll dome . 

V 

T HERE was a moon, McKie 
realized. That glowing thing 
directly in front of him had to be a 
moon. The realization told him he 
had been seeing the moon for some 
time, puzzling over it without being 
fully awake. The moon had lifted 
itself out of blackness above a 
paralyzed outline of primitive 
roofs. 

So he was still in the village. 

The moon dangled incredibly 
close. 

The back and left side of Mc- 
Kie’s head began to throb pain- 
fully. He explored his bruised 
senses, realized he had been staked 
out in the open, flat on his back, 
wrists and ankles tightly bound, 
his face pointed at the sky. 

Perhaps it was another village. 
He tested the security of his 
bindings, could not loosen them. 

His was an undignified position. 
He was flat on his back, legs 
spread, arms outstretched. 

For a time, he -watched the 
changing guard of strange con- 
stellations move across his field of 
vision. Where was this place? 
Firelight blazed up somewhere 



off to his left. It flickered, sank 
back to orange gloom. McKie 
tried to turn his head toward 
it, froze as pain stabbed up- 
ward from his neck through his 
skull. 

He groaned. 

In the darkness an animal 
screamed. The scream was fol- 
lowed by a hoarse, grunting roar. 
Silence. Then another roar. The 
sounds creased the night for 
McKie, bent it into new dimen- 
sions. He heard soft footsteps ap- 
proaching. 

“I think he groaned,” a man 
said. 

The man was speaking standard 
Galach, McKie noted. Two shad- 
ows came out of the night and 
stood over McKie’s feet. 

A female voice masked by a 
storter asked, “Do you think he’s 
awake?” 

“He’s breathing as though he 
were awake,” the man said. 

“Who’s there?” McKie rasped. 
His own voice sent agony pin- 
wheeling through his skull. 

“Good thing your people know 
how to obey instructions,” the 
man said. “Imagine him running 
loose around here!” 

“How did you get here, Mc- 
Kie?” the woman asked. 

“I walked,” McKie growled. “Is 
that you, Abnethe?” * 

“He walked;” the man said in 
angry disbelief. 

McKie, listening to that male 
voice, began to wonder about it. 
Was there a trace of alien sibilance 
in it? Was it human or humanoid? 
Among the sentients, only Pan 
Spechi could look that human — 



WHIPPING STAR 



129 





because they had shaped their flesh 
to the human pattern. 

“Unless you release me;” Mc- 
Kie said, “I won’t answer for the 
consequences.” 

“You’ll answer for them,” the 
man said. There was laughter in 
his voice. 

“We must be sure how he got 
here,” the woman said. 

“What difference does it make?” 

“It could make a great deal of 
difference. What if Fanny Mae is 
breaking her contract?” 

“That’s impossible.” 

“Nothing’s impossible. He 
couldn’t have come here without 
Caleban help.” 

“Maybe there’s another Cale- 
ban.” 

“Fanny Mae says not.” 

“I say we do away with this in- 
truder immediately,” the man said. 

“What if he’s wearing a moni- 
tor?” she asked. 

“Fanny Mae says no Taprisiot 
can locate this place.” 

“But McKie is here.” 

“And I’ve had one long-distance 
call since I arrived,” McKie said. 

No Taprisiot could locate this 
'place? What would prompt that 
statement? 

The man said, “I say we do 
away with him.” 

“You’re not very intelligent,” 
McKie said. 

“Look who’s talking about in- 
telligence.” 



M CKIE strained to discern de- 
tails of faces but they remain- 
ed blank shadows. What was it 
about that male voice? The storter 



131 




disguised the woman’s voide — but 
why would she bother? 

“I am fitted with a life moni- 
tor,” McKie said. 

“The sooner the better,” the 
man said. 

“I’ve stood as much of that talk 
as I can,” the woman said. 

“Kill me and that monitor starts 
transmitting,” McKie said. “Tap- 
risiots will scan this area and iden- 
tify everyone around me. Even if 
they can’t locate you, they’ll know 
you.” 

“I shudder at the prospect,” the 
man said. 

“We must find out how he got 
here,” the woman said. 

“What difference does it make?” 

“That’s a stupid question.” 

“So the Caleban broke her con- 
tract.” 

“Or there’s a loophole in it we 
don’t know about.” 

“Well, plug it up.” 

“I don’t know if we can. Some- 
times I wonder how much we 
really understand each other. 
What’ re connectives?” 

“Abnethe, why are you wearing 
that storterT' McKie asked. 

“Why do you call me Abnethe?” 
she asked. 

“You can disguise your voice 
but you can’t hide your sickness or 
your style,” McKie said. 

“Did Fanny Mae send you 
here?” 

“Didn’t somebody say that was 
impossible?” McKie countered. 

“He’s a brave one,” the woman 
chuckled. 

“Lot of good it does him.” 

“I don’t think the Caleban could 
break our contract,” she said. 



“You recall the protection clause? 
It’s likely she sent him here to get 
rid of him.” 

“So let’s get rid of him.” - 
“That’s not what I meant.” 

“You know we have to do it.” 
“You’re making him suffer and 
I won’t have it,” the woman said. 

“Then go away and leave it to 
me, 

“1 can’t stand the thought of his 
suffering. Don’t you understand?” 
“He won’t suffer.” 

“You have to be sure.” 

It’s Abnethe for certain, McKie 
thought, recalling her conditioning 
against witnessing pain. But who’s 
the other one? 

“My head’s hurting,” McKie 
said. “Your men practically beat 
my brains out.” 

“What brains?” the man asked. 
“We must get him to a doctor.” 
“Be sensible.” 

“You heard him. His head 
hurts.” 

“Mliss, Stop it.” 

“You used my name,” she said. 
“What difference does it make? 
He’d already recognized you.” 
“What if he escapes?” 

“From here?” 

“He got here, didn’t he?” 

“For which we can be thankful.” 
“He’s suffering,” she said. 

“He’s lying.” 

“He’s suffering. I can tell.” 
“What if we take him to a doc- 
tor, Mliss?” the man asked. “What 
if we do that and he escapes? Bu- 
Sab agents are resourceful, you 
know.” 

Silence. 

“There’s no way out of it,” the 
man said. “Fanny Mae sent him to 



132 



IF 




us and now we have to kill him.” 
44 You’re trying to drive me 
crazy — ” 

44 He won’t suffer.” 

Silence. 

44 I promise,” the man said. 

44 For sure?” 

‘‘Didn’t I say it?” 

44 I’m leaving here,” she said. 44 I 
don’t want to know what happens 
to him. You’re never to mention 
him again, Cheo. Do you hear me?” 
“Yes, my dear. I hear you.” 

“I’m leaving now,” she said. 
“He’s going to cut me into little 
pieces,” McKie said, “and I’ll 
scream with pain the whole time.” 
“Shut him up?” she screeched. 
“Come away, my dear,” the 
man said. He put an arm around 
her. “Come along now.” 

Desperately, McKie said, “Ab- 
nethe — he’s going to cause me in- 
tense.pain. You know that.” 

She began sobbing as the man 
led her away. 

“Please — please — ” she begged. 
The sound of her crying faded 
into the night. 

Furuneo, McKie thought, don't 
dally. Get that Caleban moving. I 
want out of here. Now! 

He strained against his bindings. 
They stretched just enough to tell 
him he had reached their limits. He 
could not feel the stakes move at 
all. 

Come on, Caleban! McKie 
thought. You didn't send me here 
to die. You said you loved me . 

A FTER several hours of ques- 
tioning, counter questioning, 
probe, counter probe and bootless 
answers, Furuneo brought in an 



enforcer assistant to take over the 
watch on the Caleban. At Furun- 
eo’ s request, Fanny Mae opened a 
portal and let him out onto the lava 
ledge for a spell of fresh air. It was 
cold out on the shelf, especially 
after the heat in the Beachball. The 
wind had died down as it did most 
days here just before night. Surf 
still pounded the outer rocks and 
surged against the lava wall be- 
yond the Beachball. But the tide 
was going out and only a few dol- 
lops of spraywet the ledge. 

Connectives, Furutieo thought 
bitterly. She says it’s not a linkage, 
so what is it? He couldn’t recall 
ever having felt this frustrated. 

That which extends from one to 
eight , the Caleban had said, that is 
a connective. Correct use of verb 
to be? . 

“Huh?” 

Identity verb , the Caleban said. 
Strange concept. 

“No, no! What did you mean 
there, one to eight?” 

Unbinding stuff , the Caleban 
said. 

44 You mean like a solvent?” 

Before solvent. 

“What the devil could before 
have to do with solvents?” 

Perhaps more internal than sol- 
vents , the Caleban said. , 

“Madness,” Furuneo said, 
shaking his head. Then: “Inter- 
nal?” 

Unbounded place of connec- 
tives , the Caleban said. 

“We’re right back where we 
started,” Furuneo groaned. 
44 What’s a connective?” 

Uncontained opening between , 
the Caleban said. 



WHIPPING STAR

“Between what?” Furuneo 
roared. - 

Between one and eight. 

“Ohhhh, no!” 

Also between one and X, the 
Caleban said. , 

As McKie had done earlier, Fur- 
uneo buried his face in his hands. 
Presently he said, “What’s between 
one and eight except two, three, 
four, five, six and seven?” 

Infinity, the Caleban said. Open 
ended concept. Nothing contains 
everything. Everything contains 
nothing. 

“You know what I think?” Fur- 
uneo asked. 

I read no thoughts. 

“I think you’re having your little 
game with us,” Furuneo said. 
“That’s what I think.” 

Connectives compel, the Cale- 
ban said. Does this expand under- 
standing? 

“Compels — a compulsion?” 

Venture movement, the Caleban 
said. 

“Venture what?” 

That which remains stationary 
when all else moves, the Caleban 
said. Thus, connective. Infinity 
concept empties itself without con- 
nective. 

At this point Furuneo asked to 
be let outside for a rest. 

He was no closer to understand- 
ing why the Caleban maintained 
such a high temperature in the 
Beachball. 

Consequence of swiftness, the 
Caleban said, varying this under 
questioning with: Rapidity con- 
vergence. Or, Perhaps concept of 
generated movement arrives 
closer. 



“Some kind of friction?” Fur- 
uneo" probed. 

Uncompensated relationship of 
dimensions possibly arrives at clos- 
est ■ approximation, the Caleban 
answered. 

Now, reviewing these frustrating 
exchanges, Furuneo blew on his 
hands to warm them. The sun had 
set and a chill wind was beginning 
to move off the bluff toward the 
water. 

Either I freeze to death or bake, 
he thought. Where in the universe 
is McKie? 

At this point, Tuluk made long- 
distance contact through one of the 
Bureau Taprisiots. Furuneo, who 
had been seeking a more sheltered 
position in the lee of the Beachball, 
felt the pineal ignition. He brought 
down the*foot he had been lifting 
in a step, planted the foot firmly 
into a shallow pool of water and 
lost all bodily sensation. MinH and 
call were one. 

“This is Tuluk at the lab,” the 
caller said. “Apologies for intru- 
sion and all that.” 

“I think you just made me put 
a foot in cold water,” Furuneo 
said. 

“Well, here’s some more cold 
water for you. You’re to have that 
friendly Caleban pick up McKie in 
six hours, time elapse measured 
from four hours and fifty-one min- 
utes ago. Synchronize.” 

“Standard measure?” 

“Of course standard.” ' 

“Where is he?” 

“He doesn’t know. Wherever 
that Caleban sent him. Any idea 
how it’s done?” 

“It’s done with connectives.” 



134 



IF 




“Is that right? What arc connec- 
tives?” 

“When I find out, you’ll be the 
first to know.” 

“That sounds like a temporal 
contradiction, Furuneo.” 

“Probably is. All right, let me 
get my foot out of the water. It’s 
probably frozen solid by now.” 

“You’ve the synchronized time 
coordinate for picking up McKie, 
don’t you?” 

“I got it. And I hope she doesn’t 
send him home.” 

“How’s that?” 

Furuneo explained. 

“Sounds confusing.” 

, “I’m glad you figured that out. 
For a moment there, I thought you 
weren’t approaching our problem 
with sufficient seriousness.” 

Among Wreaves seriousness 
and sincerity are almost as basic 
as they are with Taprisiots but Tu- 
luk had worked among humans 
long enough to recognize the jibe; 

“Well, every being has its own • 
insanity,” he said. 

It was a Wreave aphorism but it 
sounded sufficiently close to some- 
thing the Caleban might have said 
for Furuneo to experience a mo- 
mentary angeret-e nforced rage 
and sense his ego shimmering away 
from him. He shuddered his way 
back to mental solidity. 

“Did you almost lose yourself?” 
Tuluk asked. 

“Will you sign off and let me get 
my foot out of the water?” 

“I receive the impression you are 
fatigued,” Tuluk said. “Get some 
rest.” 

“When I can. I hope 1 don’t fall 
asleep in that Caleban hot house. 



\ , 

I’d wake up done just about right 
for a cannibal dinner.” 

“Sometimes you humans ex- 
press yourselves in a disgusting 
fashion,” the Wreave said. “But 
you’d better remain alert for a 
while. McKie may require punctu- 
ality.” 

VI 

I t was dark but Abnethe needed 
no light for black thoughts. 

Damn Cheo for a sadistic fool! 
It had been a mistake to finance 
the surgery that’d transformed the 
Pan Spechi into an ego-frozen 
freak. Why couldn’t he have stayed 
as he had been when she had first 
met him? So exotic — so — exciting. 

He was still useful, though. And 
there was no doubt he had been the 
first to see the magnificent possi- 
bilities in their discovery. That, at 
least remained exciting. 

She reclined on a softly furred 
chairdog, one of the rare feline 
adaptives which had been taught to 
lull their masters by purring. The 
soothing vibrations moved through 
her flesh as though seeking out ir- 
ritations to subdue. So relaxing. 

She sighed. 

Her apartment occupied the top 
ring of the tower they had built on 
this world, safe in the knowledge 
that their hiding place lay beyon<jl 
the reach of any law or any com- 
munication except that granted 
through a single Caleban — who 
had bbt a short time to live. 

But how had McKie come here? 
And what had McKie meant, say- 
ing he had had a call through a 
Taprisiot? 



WHIPPING STAR 



135 




The chairdog, sensitive to her 
mood, Stopped purring as Abnethe 
sat up. Had Fanny Mae lied? Did 
another Caleban remain who could 
find this place? 

Granted that the Caleban’s 
words were difficult to understand 
— granted this, yes, there was yet 
no mistaking the essentials. This 
world was a place whose key lay in 
only one mind, that of Madame 
Mliss Abnethe. 

She sat straight on the chairdog. 

And there would be death with- 
out suffering' to make this place 
forever safe — a giant orgasm of 
death. Only one door — and death 
would close it. The survivors, all 
chosen by herself, would live on in 
happiness here beyond all — con- 
nectives. 

Whatever those were. 

She stood up, began pacing back 
and forth in the darkness. The rug, 
a creature adapted like the chair- 
dog, squirmed its furry surface at 
the caress of her feet. 

An amused smile came over her 
face. 

Despite the complications and 
the strange timing required, she 
would have to increase the tempo 
of the floggings. Fanny Mae must 
be forced to discontinue as soon 
as possible. To kill without suffer- 
ing ahiong the victims, this was a 
prospect she found she still could 
contemplate. 

But there was need for hurry. 



F URUNEO leaned, half doz- 
ing, against a wall within the 
Beachball. Sleepily he cursed the. 
heat. His mindclock said he had 



slightly less than an hour before 
picking up McKie. Furuneo had 
tried to explain the time schedule 
to the Caleban but she persisted in 
misunderstanding. 

Lengths extend and distend, she 
had said. They warp and shift with 
vague movements between one 
and another. Thus time remains 
inconstant. 

Inconstant? 

The vortal tube of a S’eye jump- 
door snapped open just beyond the 
Caleban’s giant spoon. The face 
and bare shoulders of Abnethe ap- 
peared in the opening. 

Furuneo pushed himself away 
from the wall, shook his head to 
restore alertness. Damnation, it. 
was hot in here. 

“You are Alicheno Furuneo,” 
Abnethe said. “Do you know 
me?” 

“I know you.” 

“I recognized you at once,” she 
said. “I know most of your stupid 
Bureau’s planetary agents by sight. 
I’ve found it profitable.” 

“Are you here to flog this poor 
Caleban?” Furuneo asked. 

He felt for the holoscan in his 
pocket, moved into a position for 
a rush toward the jumpdoor as 
McKie had ordered. 

“Don’t make me close this door 
before we’ve had a little discus- 
sion,” she said. 

Furuneo hesitated. He was no 
Saboteur Extraordinary, but you 
didn’t get to be a planetary agent 
without recognizing when to dis- 
obey a senior agent’s orders. 

“What’s to discuss?” he asked. 

“Your future,” she said. 

Furuneo stared up into her eyes. 



136 



IF 




The emptiness of them appalled 
him. This woman was ridden by a 
compulsion. 

“My future?” he asked. 

“Whether you’re to have any 
future*” she said. 

“Don’t threaten me,” he said. 

“Cheo tells me,” she said, “that 
you’re a possibility for our pro- 
ject.” 

For no reason he could explain, 
Furuneo knew this to be a lie. Odd 
how she gave herself away. Her 
lips trembled when she said that 
name — Cheo. 

“Who’s Cheo?” he asked. 

“That’s unimportant at the mo- 
ment.” 

“What’s your project) then?” 

“Survival.” 

“That’s nice,” he said. “What 
else is new?” 

He wondered what she would 
do if he brought out the holoscan 
and started recording. 

“Did Fanny Mae send McKie 
hunting for me?” she asked. 

That question was important to 
her, Furuneo saw. McKie must 
have stirred up merry hob. 

“You’ve seen McKie?” he 
asked, 

“I refuse to discuss McKie,” she 
said. 

The response was insane, Fur- 
uneo thought. She had been the 
one to bring McKie into the con- 
versation. 

Abnethe pursed her lips, studied 
him. 

“Are you married, Alicheno 
Furuneo?” she asked. 

He frowned. Her lips had trem- 
bled again. Surely she knew his 
marital status since she had taken 



trouble to learn who he was. What 
was her game? 

“My wife is dead,” he said. 

“How sad,” She murmured. 

“I get along,” he said, angry. 
“One can’t live in the past.” 

“Ah, that is where you may be 
wrong,” she said, 

“What are you driving at?” 
“Let’s see,” she said, “your age 
— sixty-seven standard, if I recall 
correctly.” 

“You recall correctly, as you 
damn’ well know.” 

“You’re young,” she said. “You 
look even younger. I’d guess 
you’re a vital person who enjoys 
life.” 

“Aren’t we all?” he asked. 

It was going to be a bribe offer, 
then, he thought. 

“We enjoy life when we have the 
proper ingredients,” she said. 
“How odd it is to find a person 
such as yourself in that stupid 
Bureau.” 

This was close enough to a 
thought Furuneo himself had oc- 
casionally nurtured for him to be- 
gin wondering about this Cheo 
and the mysterious project with its 
'possibilities. What were they of- 
fering? ' 

Would she offer herself? She 
was an attractive female — he saw 
a generous mouth, large green 
eyes, a pleasant oval face. He had 
seen the holoscans of her figure — 
the Beauty barbers had done well 
by her. She had maintained herself 
with all the expensive care her 
money could buy. But would she 
offer herself to him? He found this 
difficult to contemplate. Motives 
and stakes didn’t fit. 



WHIPPING STAR

“What arc you afraid of?” he 
asked. 

She answered him with a pecu- 
liar note of sincerity, “Suffering.” 

F URUNEO tried to swallow. 

He had not been celibate since 
Mada’s death — nevertheless, his 
had been a special kind of mar- 
riage. It had gone beyond words 
and bodies. If anything remained 
solid and basic — connective — in 
the universe, their kind of love 
did. He had but to close his eyes 
to feel the memory-presence of 
her. Nothing could replace that 
and Abnethe must know it. She 
could not offer him anything un- 
obtainable elsewhere. 

Or could she? 

“Fanny Mae,” Abnethe said, 
“are you prepared to honor the re- 
quest I made?” 

Connectives appropriate, the 
Caleban said. 

“Connectives — ” Furuneo ex- 
ploded. “What are connectives?” 

“I don’t really know,” Abnethe 
said, “but apparently I can exploit 
them without knowing.” 

“What are you cooking up?” 
Furuneo demanded. He wondered 
why his skin felt suddenly chilled 
in spite of the heat. 

“Fanny Mae, show him,” Ab- 
nethe said. 

‘ The jumpdoor’s vortal tube 
flickered Open, closed, danced and 
shimmered. Abruptly, Abnethe no 
longer was visible in it. The door 
stood open once more, looking 
now down onto a sunny jungle 
shore, a softly heaving ocean sur- 
face, an oval stabo-yacht hanging 
in stasis above a clearing and a 



sandy beach. The yacht’s after- 
deck shields lay open to the sun, 
exposing almost in the center of 
the deck a young woman stretched 
out in repose, face down on a 
floater hammock. Her body was 
drinking the rays of a tuned sun- 
filter. 

Furuneo stared, unable to move. 
The young woman lifted her head, 
stared out to sea, lay back. 

Abnethe’s voice came from di- 
rectly over his head, from another 
jumpdoor obviously, but he 
could not take his gaze from that 
well-remembered scene. 

“You recognize this?” she 
asked. 

“It’s Mada,” he whispered. 

“Precisely.” 

“Oh, my god,” he whispered. 
“When did you scan that?” 

“It is your beloved, you’re 
sure?” Abnethe asked. 

“It’s — it’s our honeymoon,” he 
whispered. “I even know the day. 
Friends took me to visit the sea- 
dome. She didn’t enjoy swimming 
and stayed behind.” 

“How do you know the actual 
day?” 

“The flambok tree at "the edge 
of the clearing — it bloomed that 
day and I missed itr See the um- 
brella flower?” 

“Oh, yes. Then you’ve no doubt 
about the authenticity of this 
scene?” 

“So you had your snoopers 
staring at us even then?” he rasped. 

“Not snoopers. We are the 
snoopers. This is now.” 

“It can’t be! That was almost 
forty years ago!” 

“Keep your voice down.” 



138 



IF 




“How can she hear me? She’s 
been dead for — ” 

“This is now, I tell you! Fanny 
Mae?” 

In person of Furuneo, concept 
oj now contains relative connec- 
tives, the Caleban said. Nowness 
oj scene true. 

F URUNEO shook his head, re- 
membering other times. 

“We can pluck her from that 
yacht and take both of you to a 
place the Bureau will never find,” 
Abnethe said. “What do you think 
of that, Furuneo?” 

Furuneo wiped tears from his 
cheeks. He was aware of the sea’s 
ozone smell, the pungency of the 
flambok blossom. The scene had 
to be a recording, though. 

“If it’s now — why hasn’t she 
seen us?” he asked. 

“At my direction, Fanny Mae 
masks us from her sight. Sound, 
however, will carry. Keep your 
voice down.” 

“You’re lying,” he hissed. 

As though at a signal, the young 
woman rolled over, stood up and 
admired the flambok. She began 
to hum a song familiar to Furuneo. 

_ “I think you know I’m not ly- 
ing,” Abnethe said. “This is our 
secret, Furuneo. This is our dis- 
covery about the Calebans.” 

“But — how can — ” 

“Given the proper connectives, 
whatever they are, even the past is 
open to us. Only Fanny Mae Of all 
the Calebans remains to link us 
with this past. No Taprisiot, no 
Bureau, nothing can reach us 
there. We can go there and free 
ourselves forever?” 

“This is a trick,” he said. 



~ “You can see it isn’t. Smell that 
flower, the sea.” 

“But why — what do you want?” 
“Your assistance in a small 
matter, Furuneo.” 

“How?” 

“We fear someone will stumble 
on our secret before we’re ready. 
If, however, someone the Bureau 
trusts is here to watch and re- 
port-giving a false report — ” 
“What false report?” 

.“That there’ve been no more 
floggings, that Fanny Mae is hap- 
py, that — ” 

“Why those particular lies?” 
“When Fanny Mae reaches her 
— ultimate discontinuity — we can 
be far away and safe — you with 
your beloved. Correct, Fanny 
Mae?” 

Truthful essence in statement, 
the Caleban said. 



F URUNEO stared through the 
jumpdoor. Mada. She was 
rjght there. She had stopped hum- 
ming and was coating her body 
with a skin-protective. If the Cal- 
eban moved the door a little closer, 
he knew he would be able to reach 
out and touch his beloved. 

Pain in Furuneo’s chest made 
him aware of a constriction there. 

“Am — I down there some- 
where?” he asked. 

“Yes,” Abnethe said. 

“And I’ll come back to the 
yacht?” 

“If that’s what you did original- 
ly.* 

“What would I find, though?” 
“Your bride gone, disap- 
peared.” 

“But—”

139 





Would she really? Perhaps — 
yes. Yes, she would know him. She 
might even come to understand the 
need behind such a decision. But 
he saw quite clearly that she would 
never forgive him. Not Mada. 

“With proper care she might not 
have to die in thirty-one years,” 
Abnethe said. 

Furuneo nodded but the gesture 
was only for himself. 

She would not forgive him any 



“It’d be thought that some crea- 
ture of the sea or the jungle killed 
her. Perhaps she went swimming 
and—” 

“She lived thirty-one years af- 
ter that,” he whispered. 

“And you can have those thirty- 
one years all over again,” Abnethe 
said. 

“I — I wouldn’t be the same. 
She’d—” 

“She’d know you.”

ing to an empty yacht could for- 
give him. And that young man had 
not died. 

/ couldn’t forgive myself. The 
young man / was would never for- 
give me all those lovely lost years. 

“If you’re worried,” Abnethe 
said, “about changing the universe 
or the course of history or any such 
nonsense, forget it. That’s not 
how it works, Fanny Mae tells me. 



You change a single, isolated sit- 
uation, no more. The new situa- 
tion goes off about its business and 
everything else remains pretty 
much the same.” 

“I see.” 

“Do you agree to our bargain?” 
Abnethe asked. 

“What?” 

“Shall I have Fanny Mae pick 
her up for you?” 

“Why bother?” he asked. “I 



can’t agree at all to such a thing.” 
“You’rejoking.” 

He turned, stared up, saw that 
she had a small jumpdoor open 
almost directly over his head. Only 
her eyes, nose and mouth could be 
seen through the opening. » 
‘‘I am not joking.” 

Part of her hand became visible 
as she lifted it, pointed toward the 
other door. “Look down there at 
what you’re rejecting. Look, I say. 
Can you honestly tell me you don’t 
want that back?” 

He turned. 

Mada had gone back to the 
hammock, - snuggled head down 
against a pillow. Furuneo recalled 
that he had found her so when he 
had returned from the seadome. 

“You’re not offering me any- 
thing,” he said. 

“But I am. Everything I’ye told 
you is true!” 

“You’re a fool,” he said, “if you 
.can’t see the difference between 
what Mada and I had and what 
you offer. I pity — ” 

Something fiercely compressive 
gripped his throat, choked off his 
words. Furuneo’s hands groped in 
empty air as he was lifted. He 
felt his head go through jumpdoor 
resistance. His neck was precisely 
within the boundary juncture when 
the door was closed. His body fell 
back into the Beachball. 

Y OU fool, Mliss!” Cheo 
raged. “Ybu utter, complete, 
senseless fool. If I hadn’t come 
back when I — ” 

“You killed him.” she rasped, 
backing away from the bloody 
head on the floor of her sitting 



room. “You— you killed him. 
And just when I’d almost — ” 
“When you’d almost ruined ev- 
erything, “Cheo snarled, thrusting 
his scarred face close to her. 
“What do you humans use for 
brains?” 

“But he’d— ” 

“He was ready to call his 
helpers and tell them everything 
you’d blurted to him.” 

“I won’t have you talking to me 
. this way.” 

“When it’s my neck you’re put- 
ting on the block I’ll talk to you 
any way I want.” 

“You made him suffer — ” 

“He didn’t feel a thing from 
what I did. You’re the one who 
made him suffer.” 

“How can you say that?” She 
backed away from the Pan Spechi 
face with its frighteningly over- 
sized humanoid features. 

“You bleat about being unable 
to stand suffering,” he growled, 
“but you love it. You cause it all 
around you. You knew Furuneo 
wouldn’t accept your stupid offer 
but you taunted him with it, with 
what he’d lost. You don’t call that 
suffering?” 

“See here, Cheo, if you—” 

“He suffered right up to the in- 
stant I put a stop to it,” the Pan 
Spechi said. “And you know it.” 
“Stop it!” she screamed. “I 
didn’t! He wasn’t!” 

“He was and you knew it — every 
- instant you knew it.” 

She rushed at him, beat her 
fists against his chest. 

“You’re lying! You’re lying! 
You’re lying!” 

He grabbed her wrists, forced

her to her knees. She lowered her 
head. Tears ran down her cheeks. 

“Lies, lies, lies,” she muttered. 

In a softer, more reasonable 
tone he said: “Mliss, hear me. 
We’ve no way of knowing how 
much longer the Caleban can last. 
Be sensible. We’ve a limited num- 
ber of fixed periods when we can 
use the S’eye and we have to make 
the most of them. You’ve wasted 
one of those periods. We can’t af- 
ford such blunders, Mliss.” 

She kept her gaze down, refused 
to look at him. 

“You know I don’t like to be 
severe with you, Mliss,” he said, 
“but my way is best — as you’ve 
said yourself many times.- We’ve 
our own ego-integrity to preserve.” 

She nodded without looking up. 

“Let’s join the others now,” he 
said. “Plouty has devised an 
amusing new game.” 

“One thing,” she said. 

“Yes?” 

“Let’s save McKie. He’d be an 



interesting addition to — ” 

\ “No.” 

“What harm could it do? He 
might even be useful. It isn’t as 
though he’d have his precious Bu- 
reau or anything to enforce his — ” 
“No. Besides, it’s probably too 
late. I’ve already sent the Palenki 
with — well, you understand.” 

He released her wrists. 

Abenthe got to her feet, nostrils 
flaring. She looked up at him then, 
eyes peering through her lashes, 
her head tilted forward. Suddenly, 
her right foot lashed out, caught 
Cheo with a hard heel in the left 
shin. 

He danced back, nursed the 
bruise with one hand. Despite the 
pain, he was amused. 

“You see?” he said. “You do 
like to inflict suffering.” 

She was all over him then, kiss- 
ing him, apologizing. They never 
did get down to Plouty’s new 
game.

ous badges on his back. This was 
the' commander of the Dravian 
ship. 

Between the Dravian captain 
and Brand stood a low table. On 
the table was a pile of silvery 
Kendallian exchange disks, money 
of value on any civilized planet in 
the known galaxy. 

“You are the only survivor,” the 
Dravian said. “The full payment 
is yours.” 



(Continued from page 100) 

“There are two other survivors 
down there,” Brand said. “You 
could still pick them up.” 

“No,” the captain said, wrig- 
gling_his body hair in a manner 
that seemed unusual. “As you hu- 
mans say, ‘It is out of my hands.’ 
We are late and even now we will 
have difficulty rendezvousing 
with our fleet as scheduled.” 

In all honesty. Brand told him- 
self, he was not greatly grieved 



143 



over the loss of Davidson and 
Wisse. He had never particularly 
liked either of them. 

“Okay,” he said after a few mo- 
ments, “if that’s the way it is.” 

“Good,” the Dravian captain 
said. “The exhange disks are 
yours.” He paused before speak- 
ing again. “You and your com- 
panions were promised transpor- 
tation to Breman’s Planet upon the 
completion of your work.” 

“That’s right,” Brand replied, 
beginning to feel again that there 
was a lot going on that he did not 
understand. 

“Would you care to take out 
another contract?” 

“Now?” 

“Yes, immediately,” the captain 
replied. “The Dravian peoples find 
themselves at war with — another 
race. I will not go into details, ex- 
cept to say that this other race feels 
that we had infringed too frequent- 
ly into a territory they consider, to 
be theirs.” The captain removed a 
sheet of permapape from a pouch 
under his body. “This contract is 
for the duration of the war — at 
three' times your previous rate of 
pay.” 

Brand looked at the pile of disks 
on the table and things began to 
make sense — like why there were 
marines on New Iowa and why the 
corvette was late and why there 
was a fleet of Fuzzy ships and 
where they were going. He-under- 
stood. The whole business on New 
Iowa was probably just one small 



part of a whole series of provoca- 
tions. He decided not to think be- 
yond this. 

His mind went back to the pile 
of exchange disks. He already had 
a small fortune, enough to lose 
himself in the ecstasy of Breman’s 
Planet for months, maybe years. v 
“The war will be short,” the 
captain was saying. “We have been 
preparing for it for a long time. 
Our enemies have not. Already our 
fleets are massed. Your job will 
consist of no more than mopping 
up the planet after we have de- 
stroyed its defenses. The condi- 
tions of the planet are ideal for 
your lifeform, by the way.” A brief 
pause. “I guarantee you no more 
than six standard months and a 
bonus at least equal to this when 
we have finished.” 

Brand looked at the pile of disks 
again, visualizing it doubled. What 
did he owe anybody? 

“Okay,” he said. “Six months- 
and then Breman’s Planet.” 

“This is guaranteed,” the Drav- 
ian said but there was something in 
that alien voice that Brand won- 
dered about, some strange into- 
nation that seemed to carry — was 
it disgust? 

Brand took the offered contract, 
signed it and thumbed it without 
reading it and handed it back. 

S EVEN standard months later 
Brand lay in the luxury of 
Breman’s Planet, surrounded by 
all the sensual delights men had

ever managed to devise. A girl’s 
hand slipped a euphoric into his 
mouth, then roved across his 
body. He sighed. With the bundle 
he had he could live like this for 
the rest of his life — if only he 
could stop remembering, stop 
thinking. 

But he couldn’t. The once-beau- 
tiful planet had been a shambles. 
Its proud people were little more 
than slaves to the victorious Drav- 
ians. Its economic and political 
and moral power was finally and 
forever broken. For all practical 
purposes it was a planet as dead as 
its huge moon. 

Brand had walked among its de-

“How?” asked Tokay. 

Garm shrugged and Serteze an- 
swered, “He got drunk out of his 
mind and missed the flight.” The 
embarrassed Searcher reached for 
the guitar and handed the instru- 
ment to Tokay. ‘Come on. Let’s 
get out of here.” 

C RIMINAL historians of later 
years would return again and 
again to this point in the most 
disconcerting case to remain un- 
solved in FPA files. How the FPA 
managed to turn complete victory 
into complete defeat in a few 
hours remained fertile ground for 
the wildest speculations. The only 
possible trace of the culture once 
known as The Entertainers turned 
up years later in a rather ambigu- 



feated people, a conqueror, and 
they, the beaten ones, had called 
him Judas, though he wasn’t sure 
what that meant. Nor did he want 
to know. 

He knew too much as it was. He 
shuddered inside himself and hated 
the Dravians — and wondered 
which planet was next 'on their list: 
Breakdown Heights, Cordoba, 
New California, Breman’s Planet, 
which human world? 

But he knew what he hated even 
more than the Dravians. And he 
would have to live with that— if he 
didn’t pick up the pistol that lay a 
few centimeters from his hand and 
burn away his skull. •

ous lawsuit over the ownership of 
a starship’s hull being used as an 
aging tank on Butus 3. The iden- 
tity of the hull could not be estab-. 
lished and possession was ruled as 
indicating ownership. When the 
FPA finally closed the case, wine 
had become one of the cheapest 
items in the Federation. 

The three . Entertainers crossed 
the ramp in silence until Tokay 
realized that their destination was 
the sleek FPA cruiser. 

“Wow!” 

“We can only die once and it’s 
the fastest ship in this part of the 
Federation,” said Serteze. 

As they approached the landing 
fins of the spacecraft Tokay 
sensed something familiar about 
the FPA agents guarding the ship.

Then he recognized Paddy and 
The Gladiator. 

Garm answered his thoughts. 
“They came in on a passenger 
liner while you were out planting. 
Almost everyone is on board. We 
were waiting for you.” 

The ship was sealed as the last 
Entertainer boarded. The Search- 
er took over the controls and 
proudly displayed his newly 
gleaned knowledge. As the last 
man reported and was strapped in, 
Serteze released the clamps jind 
the Spaceport alarms broke loose. 
The emergency communications 
band flashed on, asking for identi- 
fication. 

Garm answered, “Entertainers, 
here. Request permission to take 
off—” and then, as Serteze lifted 
the ship starward — “we are taking 
off anyway.” 

The FPA cruiser was the fastest 
ship on Phobus and wgs in warp 
before any attempt at pursuit had 
cleared the Port. 

Paddy came up from the lower 
deck and asked, “Where are we 
going?” 

“How about Butus 3,” said 
Garm. “They won’t look for us 
there.” 

Paddy raised an eyebrow. 

“You mean that after allof this, 
we’ll still have to buy imported 
wine?” 

“Looks like,” said Serteze. 

Tokay smiled at the irony of it. 
His fingers scrummed the guitar 
as he said, “What were those lyr- 



ics .. oh yeh ... I remember . .” 

T HE police cruiser sat angletT 
into the curb, the sidewaik 
door ajar. Dawn was barely show- 
ing and few people were up to see 
the flashing red light blink its fear- 
ful message. Sister Marion had 
found the body and stood trans- 
fixed, tapping a dirge on a tam- 
bourine while policemen ex- 
amined the corpse. 

The sergeant kicked the body. 
“Yep. Charlie Three is no long- 
er with us.” 

The younger patrolman who 
was bending over the corpse 
reached behind his back and 
touched the sergeant’s leg. 

“Don’t do that. He was a man.” 
“Oh, sorry. Didn’t know you 
were that touchy, kid. I’ll call for 
the white wagon.” 

The patrolman eased the tom 
and tattered suit aside and pulled 
away the ruffled newspapers until 
he found a battered piece of 
leather that had once been a bill- 
fold. 

“This is unit eleven-o-nine at 
the corner of Howell and Ander- 
son Streets. We have an unknown 
DOA,” the sergeant said into the 
microphone. 

“Not unknown,” called the pa- 
trolman. “He has a name.” The 
patrolman turned the Musician’s 
Union Card a little more toward 
the light to make out the almost 
time-erased name. “It’s Tokay 
Wilson.”

IF 




“A what?” loudly asked the ser- 
geant. 

‘‘T-O-K-A-Y. It’s the name of a 
grape,” answered the patrolman. 

He covered the timeless re- 
mains of the little figure and tried 
not to think about it. The hear$e 
arrived and the attendants rolled 
the big-wheeled cart alongside of.

power to return in new bodies cen- 
tury after century and has largely 
been responsible for the destruc- 
tion of most of man’s dreams of 
progress. And in the background 
are the Patricks who seem to re- 
gard themselves as guardians 
against evil, though their legends 
indicate God had long-ago rejected 
them and made them exterior to 
the universe of reality. 

All this takes place in a world in 
the near future, one where men 
have supposedly reached a high 
point of progress. The population 
explosion has been checked, the 
arts have hit a new high and every- 
one seems to have been freed from 
misery and poverty. Unfortunately 
this is told to us but never shown. 
We get mention of places and 
events, but the whole world is at 
best a shallow stage for the story, 
lacking any discernible reason for 
us to care about it. The only two 
examples of what might be normal 
men who play any part in the story 
are empty pseudo-intellectuals 
who seem intent only on justify- 



Charlie Three. 

In flashing flurry the vehicles

was to be elsewhere. • 



ing their failure to be more, though 
Michael Fountain is described to 
us as having extraordinary capa- 
bilities. 

This tendency to tell us about 
things and then show nothing that 
merits what we are told is charac- 
teristic of the entire story. The 
menacing figures are described in 
copious words and symbols. The 
seven weavers are supposed to be 
figures of passion and supreme 
ambition. But in their conversation 
and their actions, they come across 
as comic-opera villains at best. 
They cause enough trouble but 
they manage to achieve nothing 
that is of any real importance to 
the story. Oh, they think they’re 
doing great things, particularly to 
themselves. But the most they do 
(aside from a little wanton and 
petty killing that does them no 
good) is to communicate the pow- 
er to read minds to those they are 
trying to control — hardly a trick 
they could want. 

The returnees, the ones who can 
pass from body to body, should be 
solidly menacing. With the ability

to take over anyone they choose 
and with centuries of planning, 
they should represent about the ul- 
timate of power. We’re told at var- 
ious times that they do represent 
such power. But when we finally 
meet their chief example, he is little 
more than a loud-mouthed fool 
with certain peculiar habits, such 
as breathing water. He spills what- 
ever information is wanted to the 
protagonist and makes threats that 
are even less convincing than what 
has been threatened before. 

The patricks are a bit more fan- 
cifully interesting. One keeps a 
kind of ape-dog ghost (who has no 
importance in the story). Another 
seems to guard a fountain that 
chains evil in a sort of never-world 
not quite identical with the real 
earth. Both run on at the mouth 
about their importance and neith- 
er seems to have any real sense of 
power. The second one comes on 
stage again briefly to cry that the 
evil has escaped from his fountain 
— and then runs off, sniveling a bit 
but totally helpless. 

Our protagonist is Freddy Fol- 
ey, described as a man with good 
eyes and simple brain. This works 
out as the literal truth. Foley — we 
are told — matures during the story 
and everyone comments on this — 
if so, there is no_ evidence in his 
actions. 

Partly as a result of being 
touched by the brain-weaving, he 



gets a hunch at the very beginning 
of the book that Carmody is a man 
who has lived before. He is also not 
only aware of the brain-weavers 
but has one of them as his girl 
friend. This should be quite a 
background for a reporter — but he 
fiddles gropingly with his' worries 
through more than half of the 
book. Then he finally asks for and 
gets an appointment with Carmo- 
dy, where the returnee spills as 
much of the big hush-hush secret 
as we ever get. When Foley is 
locked up in an insane asylum, it 
seems logical enough; only a crazy 
fool would have put himself so eas- 
ily into such a trap. 

The eventual struggle is singu- 
larly unconvincing. After pleading 
for help to escape, Foley and a few 
others decide to jump the fence. 
With no further details on how 
they plan this, they do so. And 
now, because of a note from a man 
whose motives Foley cannot un- 
derstand, he and his band go about 
killing returnees, (Why none of the 
all-powerful returnees has enough 
sense to shoot him and his band 
during the riots that occur at this 
time is a matter left uncovered.) 

But none of it matters. Our pro- 
tagonist quits his killing and joins 
his girl friend for more talk at a 
cafe' ending this episode. But it’s 
all right. The brain-weavers decide 
to achieve their power by destroy- 
ing themselves, while the return- 



148 



IF 




ees apparently give up for some 
other reason. And in the end, each 
of the three groups somehow de- 
cides Foley is such a magnificent 
champion of man that they make 
him their leader. 

Of course, material such as this 
has a built-in-cop-out. It’s labeled 
as humor or satire — or both. I’m 
afraid I can’t find that it qualifies 
on either ground. There aren’t 
enough human characters here for 
any handling of human foibles and 
the conditions are generally too re- 
mote from reality to give us much 
chance for telling satjre. In addi- 
tion, everything is cluttered up. Re- 
peated symbols, allegory, legend, 
fantasy and assorted other things 
intrude to the point where there is 
no consistent tone or attack. Any- 
how, it’s pretty darned hard to sat- 
irize something as weak as the story 
of Foley and his- menaces. A bad 
story makes for bad humor and 
bad satire, as Wodehouse and 
Swift knew long ago. 

There are some lovely inconsis- 
tencies within the basic postulates. 
The weavers, for instance, can 
seize a passing girl and turn her — 
both physically and mentally— 
into one of their own group who 
has died, but their two major at- 
tempts to control minds fail when 
the men who are to be controlled 
slip out of their clutches without 
their knowing it. And there are 
added* details, such as a real de- 
mon anc} constant hints that man 
must have originated on a world 



with a longer day-night cycle. But, 
like the revolutionist who appears 
often in the story, all this comes to 
exactly nothing in the end. 

This simply isn’t my" dish of tea. 
I’ve never found that weak catnip 
tea improved from an infusion of 
musk and cinnamon. I’d. much 
rather read about The Great Men- 
ace over a cup of tea with the in- 
credible Dr. Fu Manchu. 

O NE of the most popular forms 
of fiction in our field has al- 
ways been the novella — or long 
novelette, as it used to be called. 
There are a lot of story ideas that 
require more space . than a short 
for full development, but which 
simply don’t shape up into full 
novels without so much padding 
that the result is an unhappy one. 
Suclr a length, of course, is excel- 
lent for the magazines. But in the 
book field it presents a problem. 
If such a story is included in the 
usual anthology, it will take up so 
much space that there isn’t room 
left for the number of shorter 
works most readers expect. And 
while a few novellas have been 
published as books, few readers 
will pay enough for such small 
books to justify the “expense of 
printing and distributing them. 

The obvious answer has occured 
to several publishers: Do a book of 
about three such novellas by dif- 
ferent writers on a single theme. If 
the theme seems interesting and 
the writers’ names are good ones.

it seems certain to attract readers. 

Such was the idea behind the old 
Twayne Triplets. In at least one 
case, the result was outstanding. 
Witches Three was a huge 'book 
and a superb one.. It had an entire 
original novel of witchcraft by 
Fletcher Pratt which may have 
been the finest thing he ever wrote. 
And the other two stories (by Fritz 
Leiber and James Blish) were al- 
ready classics when they were in- 
cluded. But later works were not 
so successful. Most of them in- 
volved having someone construct 
an imaginary world and then let- 
ting three Writers do what they 
could with it. Sometimes one story 
might justify the book — but the re- 
sults, at best, were spotty. It’s just 
not possible to hand someone 
else’s idea to three writers and ex- 
pect them to turn out their top per- 
formance on order. 

The latest example of this con- 
cept is Three for Tomorrow, by 
Robert Silverberg, Roger Zelazny 
and James Blish (Meredith Press, 
$5.95). It also contains a foreword 
by Arthur C. Clarke, setting up the . 
basic idea around which the three 
stories center. 

On the whole it’s a fairly good 
example of what I have come to 
feel is a rather poor structure for a 
book. The basic idea here (from 
Clarke) is that any highly techni- 
cal society must offer not only pos- 
sibilities for great progress but al- 
so for unforeseen disasters. (Our 
own polluted air and streams indi- 



cate this, not to mention what is 
happening to our cities.) This is a 
less limiting concept than most, 
fortunately, and the results from 
three fine writers are at least al- 
ways .interesting. 

Silverberg takes what may be the 
most obvious danger from our fu- 
ture, though he has limited it to an 
area that can be handled, rather 
than trying to make it world-wide 
— an excellent choice for his prop- 
osition. He asks what might hap- 
pen if a chemical producing am- 
nesia were to get into the water 
supply of San Francisco. 

The idea of drugs in the water 
supply isn’t exactly new, but it has 
usually been brutally mishandled 
as a horror story without relieving 
highlights. By using amnesia rath- 
er than total madness or a horri- 
ble plague, Silverberg manages to 
let us follow the characters in a far 
better story situation. Nor does he 
wipe out all memories, which 
would be just as much a fictional 
disaster as any other doom. By us- 
ing only an unpredictable but se- 
lective loss of memory, his charac- 
ters are faced with divergent prob- 
lems in coping with the aspects of 
the world that are wiped from 
their minds. As a story device, this 
is neatly done. 

However, the stories within the 
story are necessarily spotty, ancf 
the way they are woven together 
seems a bit hurried. A relation is 
indicated between the various 
problems and it adds to the co- 



150 



IF 




herence of the novella. But in fal- 
lowing bits and pieces, it’s hard to 
work up any great interest in any 
one character. The best bit, in fact, 
remains that of a man who is a fa- 
natic about bottled water and is 
not affected by the trouble — a 
somewhat pathetic and yet rather 
stalwart old reactionary who must 
put duty above Duty. 

Zelazny tells a more personal 
story, and one with some of his 
feeling for characters who are 
somehow outside normal society 
and larger for the distance. In this 
case, the menace is the regimen- 
tation of all the population under 
the computers that can handle the 
data for every citizen from birth to 
death. The hero is a man who 
worked in setting up the program 
and who found a way to wipe out 
his record, while still having ac- 
cess to the computer to insert any 
false information about an identi- 
ty for himself that he might choose. 

He’s put into a situation where 
he has to serve the very Security 
that he has turned from, in an ex- 
periment that may either be a bless- 
ing or a curse. And the conflict 
between his idealism and his indi- 
vidual freedom takes over. 

Blish digs most deeply into the 
basic situation suggested by 
Clarke. As might be expected from 
his other stories, he brings a rich 
supply of ideas to indicate what 
kind of doom mankind can make 
for himself. He takes the simple 
facts that any organism must be 



choked off in its own wa;te prod- 
ucts and the actual development 
of ^uch waste is going on now and 
lays out- a grim and rather logical 
background. 

Many of the results are less than 
obvious, yet they are all tied iii 
neatly throughout. Paddling a ca- 
noe from Chelsea to Times Square 
in Manhattan is completely logical 
in his world, even though there has 
been no disaster that has made the 
island sink. The human figures in 
the story are either a bit more 
stock or less interesting than those 
in the other two novellas, but the 
background detail is such that 
there is no loss from this. 

All three stories show ingenuity 
and exhibit a good deal of the skill 
of the writers. Any one of the three 
would almost certainly be an ac- 
ceptable lead novelette for an issue 
of a magazine. And yet none of 
them represents the very best work 
of the writers. 

This is probably inevitable. The 
best stories of any author are not 
easily produced on order, but are 
combinations of mood, luck, ideas 
and a host of other intangibles. 
But in this case the defects of the 
three all seem to share a somewhat 
common element. 

The stories are well thought out 
against the suggestion put forward 
by Clarke. But none is as com- 
pletely developed from the angle 
of pure story as it should be. All 
seem to slough off the ending a 
bit more casually than it should be

treated. And all really seem to 
lack the fullest use of character 
and mood. 

Blish’s story suffers most in this 
respect. After preparing us for 
idoom in ten years, he puts us down 
with a group willing to face that 
doom. And then he compresses 
hrs ending into a few hours. Tech- 
nologically, this is justified; artis- 
tically — in its human elements — it 
goes completely agley. This has 
been a story of approaching doom 
and the reactions to it; suddenly, 
the hammer of Thor hits — and the 
doom, as always, precedes the 
rumble of its thunder. 

I suspect that what we have here 
are three stories that would have 
grown into three novels of far 
more importance if the writers had 
been able to afford the time and- 
thought — as well as space — to

function: Rau Lou had rigged the 
manual override for conventional 
drive but she couldn’t manage 
warp drive without an intact ship 
intelligence. And that seemed to ' 
be gone — starship cerebral death. 

Spider tried energizing the cir- 
cuits again. He shrugged. 

“Nothing but primordial re- 
flexes. Personality has died.” 

Olga jolted the tractor beam 
emotionally and set .up such a 
keening that the ’ponies plants 
folded their leaves. Spider and Rau 
Lou steadied themselves until 01- 



make the most of them. Certain- 
ly Blish needs a decade coverage of 
the League of Last Days, and 
Zelazny has only brought his hero 
to the beginning of his conflict. 

At softcover prices, this would 
still be a good book; but $5.95 
would probably buy far more en- 
joyment from the same writers if 
invested in their other works. 

After looking at a score or so of 
such books based upon a single 
theme, I can only conclude that it 
works much better for short stories 
and for reprints than for original 
novellas. Perhaps the idea of such 
a book is Workable. But if so. I’d 
strongly recommend to the pub- 
lishers that they give the writers a 
much longer period to work on 
their stories, or relax all . limita- 
tions on length and be willing to 
let the stories be self-determined. •

ga settled down. Spider had never 
seen such a cybernetic outburst 
over the death of a machine. 

“Rau Lou, what kind of a ship 
was it?” he asked as he patted the 
now inert brain case. 

“Seventy-sixth generation of the 
Komputerized Aerospace Re- 
search Lab — KARL series,” she 
said. “I guess I was pretty fond of 
him, too.” 

Then a lot of things began to 
make sense to Spider. It had been 
the ships that had fallen at Grus — 
not the humans. •

IF 





Readers write — and wrong! 



SNEAKY I did not intend to be. It 
was just that in the turmoil of the great 
changeover I asked a good friend and 
colleague to handle Hue and Cry and 
now I seem to have some great people 
propping me up and others beating me 
about the head and shoulders — and 
still others painstakingly explaining— 
about the Great Debate. I want to say 
now— and quickly— that I have never 
debated the merits of the New Wave vs. 
the Old Wave, that I am normally ex- 
cited by good new writing, regardless 
of school of origin. 

For IF /GALAXY I simply want the 
best stories available — hell, I already 
have the best readers. 

So take over. 

Dear Editor: 

Congratulations . / had my doubts 
about the maintenance of quality in 
your magazines ( I tend to think oj 
GALAXY and IF as extensions of the 
same general magazine) when the edi- 
torship changed , but so far there have 



been no indications of deterioration. 

- Right now the GALAXY publications 
are the most consistent on the market 
In terms of quality; seldom is there a 
bad story , and never a bad issue in the 
past five years or so. This is perhaps the 
mainstay of your popularity; there are 
other magazines that will in a given 
month have an absolutely phenomenal 
issue , much better than yours , but the 
next month that same magazine might 
be a complete miss. 

Also , congratulations on the new 
printer. If the October IF is a good in- 
dication, the appearance and readabil- 
ity of IF and GALAXY have been sub- 
stantially upgraded. 

And now a criticism or two. One of 
the major faults of your publications 
under the old management was the 
handling of subscriptions and mail- 
ings. Addresses were never changed 
when requested; if they were, it was 
only after repeated letters. I hope that 
this aspect of your operations will 9 
improve soon.

Great Shout— WORLDS OF TO- 
MORROW, Jan. ’65; Riverworld— 
WORLDS OF TOMORROW, Jan. 
’66; The Suicide Express— WORLDS 
OF TOMORROW, Mar. ’66; The 
Felled Stax— WORLDS OF IF, Jul .- 
Aug . ’67)? For all its faults , I thought 
that this was one of the most inventive 
series going . It was suspenseful, excit- 
ing, unusual, “mind-expanding” and 
showed a deep concern for some rather 
pressing problems of human nature. 
But the story of the Riverworld was 
definitely not finished; as it stood {ap- 
proximately 200 pages written) Farmer 
looked like he could go on for another 
several episodes before he resolved the 
conflict. Can we expect any more on 
this theme from him, and if so, when? 

I take it that WORLDS OF IF has 
abandoned its policy of publishing 
{and identifying) a new author a 
month. This I feel was a mistake. 
Proof? Look at the October Hue and 
Cry. Larry Niven and Perry Chapde- 
laine both were published under this 
policy. In addition, several other au- 
thors named ( McAllister , Margroff, 
Filer); even if they never become great 
names, they are good authors who con- 
tribute fine stories to the field. 

Sure, you say, we still publish new 
authors when good ones turn up. Of 
course you do — any sub-classification 
of literature , especially a specialty like 

science fiction, must continually turn 
up new talent to survive. But it is a 
great encouragement to new authors 
to know that there is an advertised 
steady market for their writings. And 
as a result many of them will guide 



their stones into your hands — give you 
first crack at them, so to speak. Every- 
body benefits thereby: you, the new 
writer and especially the reader. 

Finally, please. Please , PLEASE!!! 
— let’s have no more general discus- 
sions over the general merits of the 
“New Wave” in either editorials or 
letter columns. If a person wants to 
derogate or defend a specific author 
on a specific story, that’s fine, but let- 
ters of the type of Mr. Cover’s in the 
October IF are a waste of time. Face 
it, both sides have become extremely 
polarized and nobody wants to listen 
to anyone of a different view any 
more. The “New Wave” has its good 
points— the literary quality of the field 
has been upgraded, for instance — and 
its bad ones — as an example, too many 
“New Wave” stories are literary exer- 
cises totally devoid of real content. But 
these constant harangues pro and con 
convince no one; all they do is clutter 
up magazines with repetitions of opin- 
ions that everybody has been overex- 
posed to during the last three years or 
so. 

All in all, I am impressed with the 
change in editorship; I expected the 
Galaxy magazines to somehow de- 
crease in quality and to my surprise 
they did not. But there is still much 
room for improvement, as there was 
under Mr. Pohl’s guidance. 

Very truly yours, 
Larry

Philip Farmer is completing a book-

series — whether or not it will complete

the series I don’t think Phil himself 
knows. It’s a long river but we’ll all 
camp on it soon. 

IF Firsts are very much on the agen- 
da. More on this at a later date. 

Dear Mr. Jakobs son. 

First of all I would like to compli- 
ment you on the way you have im- 
proved the way GALAXY and IF are 
being printed. It was nice to get my 
magazines with the date on the cover 
the correct month. But for the last 
week now I have seen the next issue on 
the newsstands and I still haven t re- 
ceived my copy in the mail. All the oth- 
er sf magazines that I subscribe to get 
my copy to me a day before they go on 
9ale to the newsstands. This saves me a 
lot of worrying as to whether or not I 
am going to get it or miss the next in- 
stallment of the current serial. I think 
that it would be a good idea if GAL- 
AXY and IF did the same. 

I just finished reading the October 
issue of IF and it was great ! My favor- 
ite was None But I. It was the best 
novelette that I have read this year in 
your magazines . I also especially liked 
Survival, The. Mind Bomb and Down 
on the Farm. 

Van Vogt’s story in the September 
GALAXY was tremendous also. 

I would like to know when 
WORLDS OF TOMORROW will be 
out. After seeing the advertisements in 
my magazines I have been looking for 
it and I still haven’t seen it. Where is 
it? 

Sincerely , 

Bill A nd resen

Remember WORLDS OF TO- 
MORROW? 

Why did you not complete the Riv- 
erworld series as you promised?

The new WORLDS OF TOMOR- 
ROW is ready to roll. Publication has 
been held up by printing problems, now 
nicely on the way to solutions. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I just finished reading your interest- 
ing editorial in October IF. But what , 
exactly , did it mean? Surely you didn’t 
have to go through all that just to in- 
troduce a new printer? 

Aside from the puzzlement above , 
one thing remains clear — that IF is on 
the way to its fourth Hugo. 

Sincerely , 

William Max Miller 

Saltsburg, Penna. 

The editorial meant simply that it 
was a lovely, sunny day— and you’ve 
just proved it. 

Ip the course of a lifetime spent in 
the word game — i.e., editing in radio, 
television, magazines,, books, with the 
necessary amount of writing both fic- 
tion and fact thrown in — I’ve held and 
still uncomfortably hold virtually every 
contradictory point of view expressed 
in the following letter. The sharp edges 
of all the arguments remain and I can 
still hurt myself without outside help 
on the excellent points made by both 
sides in the writer-editor controversy. 

Scars and cooperation make one 
answer — and Jack Gaughan and I are 



HUE AND CRY

experimenting with another in the 
February issue of GALAXY ’ 

In the meantime I’m grateful for the 
clear reportage in the following. 



Gentlemen: 

For the benefit of the unanointed 
who didnt attend the St. Louis co,n~ 
vention, a panel of editors admitted to 
tampering ( they call it editing to fit 
mechanical requirements ) with many 
writers work. One editor virtually 
bragged that he had cut as much as 
5000 words from some writers mater- 
ial and personally written as much as 
5000 words to add to other stories. 

Whereupon the writers — led by Har- 
lan Ellison , naturally! — went up the 
walls en masse and ripped the acoustic 
hangings to shreds in an orgy of teeth - 
gnashing . 

The editors fled in panic and left the 
field to the writers. Who — as writers 
are wont to do — immediately fell to 
squabbling amongst themselves. With 
Harlan Ellisons dulcet tones and 
whiplash tongue rising several decibels 
above the squalling multitude— as 
usual. ■ 

During this lively exchange, it oc- 
curred to me that there is a " third 
force” who characteristically go unrep- 
resented in this age-old controversy— 
the fans who pay for all this. 

Strictly speaking, / am not a non- 
writing fan. I do non-fiction free- 
lance for a hobby^and secondary in- 
come. However, I have never published 
fiction, much less sf. This gives me an 
opportunity to circulate among the 
fans at an sf convention and hear com- 
ments that are not filtered through the 



nervous^dulatidh^envy^hate syn-% 
drome that most fans fall into when 
confronted with a writer or editor . 

I would say that at least 75% of the - 
fans supported the writers in opposing 
editorial tampering . Some even regard 
higher prices and nearly blank pages as 
preferable to changing the text. A sur- 
prising number mentioned noticing in- 
consistencies in published work and 
concluded that this was the result of 
editorial butchery — a questionable 
premise, / think. Writers have their bad 
days, too, which often result in bumps 
in the literary road. 

Many fans commented on the wide- 
spread practice of beating a good 
theme to death. Honors went by a 
handsome margin to the Conan books, 
which seem to be written by filling in 
blanks left for names and places in a 
pile of manuscripts xeroxed in ad- 
vance. Although most fans blame the 
editors, it seems to me that this re- 
quires a collaboration — neither an edi- 
tor nor a writer can do it alone. 

Although few fans commented, I 
feel strongly about the closely related 
business of editor-writer combos gang- 
ing up on a particularly successful 
work. Stranger in a Strange Land has 
been aped until it has started to grow 
hair by Dune World, Bug Jack Barron 
and several lesser lights. All are basi- 
cally fictional studies of mass move- 
ments, done from slightly different 
viewpoints in slightly different words . 
Furthermore , l suspect that all these 
writers used Eric H offer s The True 
Believer for their real-life research 
source. 

I feel strongly about another area of 
fan comment. I am quite willing to 



156 



IF 




plow through a story written in San - 
skrit by a demented chimpanzee on 
wet toilet paper— if the basic theme is 
of interest . There is a growing feeling 
that established publishers are putting 
entirely too much emphasis on smooth 
transitions and winnowed widows and 
not enough emphasis on ideas. 

In a related vein , a sizable minority 
feel that sf editors are not publishing 
content of interest to readers , partic- 
ularly \ young readers . One fan made 
the point that the existence of success- 
ful “fanzines' is ample proof of failure 
by established firms to buy and publish 
what the readers want. 

In short, fans seem to regard writers 
as inexhaustible founts of wisdom who 
will continue for all eternity to spout 
bright new ideas in a sparkling techni- 
color stream — and editors as fitmble- 
fingered mechanics who can be trusted 
only so far as to allow them the holy 
privilege of converting the sacred writ- 
ings into a form suitable for mass 
duplication. 

Extremism like this is, of course, 
pure hogwash. Nevertheless, I feel that 
both writers and editors could do 
much to improve the field. 

The . editors by keeping their greasy 
mitts off the writers' work and increas- 
ing the “turnover of writers by pub- 
lishing fewer sequels by established 
“ names' ' and more new work by un- 
published writers. 

More important, higher rates would 
make it possible for good writers to 
take the time to search for genuinely 
new ideas. For the editor, I would 
think that the increased quality would 
show a profit by attracting better sales. 

The writers by not being so damn 



quick to " turn pro” thereby making 
themselves dependent on writing to 
make the payments on Baby's new 
mink. 

There is much to be said for a new 
pro having a part-time job to provide 
his basic living expenses— freeing the 
writer of much of the money pressure. 
In this position, a writer can withhold 
submission- to editors who butcher his 
work, take the necessary time to dig 
out truly new ideas and allow his tech- 
nique to mature naturally, instead of 
undergoing the forced growth that too 
often has the same effect on a writer 
that weed spray has on garden plants. 

One of the windup speakers made a 
point that the movie and TV rights to 
much good SF*. are falling into the 
hands of speculators who have no in- 
tention of producing anything. 

Given adequate income from other 
sources, I have long wished that writ- 
ers would hang onto their movie and 
TV rights uhtil interest is shown by a 
working producer who will waive re- 
sale rights and guarantee production. 

It seems to me that this would pro- 
duce a three-way positive feedback, 
in that the producer would get his story 
for a better price, leaving more money 
to put together a better product; the 
writer would get more money, giving 
him more time to write a better source 
story; and the consumer — the viewer — 
would respond to the increased quality 
with better ratings; this in turn produc- 
ing more gross income. 

This sort of self-feeding effect needs 
only a small initial push to cause a big 
improvement in the whole field .

uearairs: 

Just a line to say how much I enjoy 
your magazines. I am hooked for life! 
But I do have a couple of questions . 

♦ How about more stories about 
that crazy dentist Dr. Dillingham , at 
least one Retief and how about another 
— Hayden Howard story on the Esks? 
Also one about that planet which is 
one long river and if you get killed you 
end up someplace else alive ! Seems to 
me you are neglecting all the men who 
made you what you are. 

Sincerely yours, 
Michael Lee Boren 
Duluth , Minn. 

Riverworld will return. I have de- 
leted one of your questions. It has no 
answer — the question itself is incor- 
rect. 

Dear Mr. Jakobs son: 

Vm waiting for you to prove your- 
self ; and if the Oct IF is any indication , 
youll do. Not a clinker in the lot ; Vm 
not quite sure what Malzberg and Her- 
bert were trying to do, but they wrote 
well enough mihat it doesn't matter 
much. The most pleasant things, 
though, were a Laumer story without 
the usual blood A guts, which I find 
even more depressing than anti-hero 
stories. And Chapdelaine is coming 
along very nicely after the abominable 
(A at times silly) writing of the Spork 
stories. 

Actually, if you knocked off the 
pompous editorials A quit replying to 
letters. I'd be completely content— e.g., 
you agree with Matt Hickman on the 
square root of minus one as Heinleiris 



preaicnon oj transngnt velocity , wnen 
it should be obvious that the square 
root of minus one is one of the Joggers 
thrown in when an author has no ex- 
planation to make. 

As for you vs. New Wave , I agree 
with Cover on your paranoia. 44 Take 
over * sf indeed! If the New Wavers 
ever claimed to take over, it was on 
one premise: that their stuff is better 
than Old W. A so will push it out. 
Egotistic, yes, but your fantasies of 
New Wave Storm Troopers seem a 
smidge overblown. Meseemeth your 
definition of New Wave is t4 anti-hero 
stories," which makes it easy to shrug 
off non-anti-hero writers who are 
New Wave in experimentalism, depth 
of character, etc.
