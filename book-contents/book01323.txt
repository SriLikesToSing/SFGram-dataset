TO SOLVE THE FUTURE 



A S we all know, science fiction Is 
fun to read, and stimulating be- 
sides. In addition to those two attri- 
butes there is one more that has led 
a igreat many people to read it, and 
that is science fiction reputation 
over the years for predicting the 
future of technological innovation. 
It is astonishing to realize just how 
many sober-minded R&D directors 
from time to time take down their 
back numbers of sf magazines and 
thumb through them, hoping for 
some clue on just what they’ll be 
doing next ... or what they should 
be doing now. 

On the record, science fiction has 
a lot to offer them. In 1934, Albert 
Einstein doubted that atomic power 
would ever be economically practical 
— but sf writers, of course, had had 
no doubts about it for years before 
that. In 1945, Vannevar Bush dis- 
puted the probability of interconti- 
nental ballistic missiles — though 
they had long been old hat in sf. 
Radar, television, space satellites — 
the list of predictions from science- 
fiction stories is familiar to all of 
us by now, and on the whole it is 
a more successful list of predictions 
than can be offered by most of the 
hard-nosed studies into probability 
conducted by experts. (Consider even 
such relatively simple predictions 
as iK>pulation growth and water 
need: these studies have been made 



regularly and endlessly for decades, 
and the people who made them have 
always erred in the direction of timi- 
dity. Witness how many of our big 
cities have been running dry in re- 
cent years ! ) 

What makes it possible for science- 
fiction writers to guess more accu- 
rately than experts so much of the 
time? 

Two things, we think. First — as 
a young lady from Italy told us once 
— “we are not afraid to be wrong”. 
Second, because science-fiction writ- 
ers are usually not experts in the 
particular field of any one specific 
prediction, they are able to see past 
the particular hang-up that every 
expert knows so well — but that 
some other expert, in some other 
field, will find an end-run around. 
Only an expert could have calcu- 
lated so precisely in 1900 that air- 
craft could not fly. Only a nonexpert 
could see that the limitations in en- 
gine weight and strength of struc- 
tural members would be overcome by 
lighter engines and stronger metals. 

However, “science” is not a collec- 
tion of statements of “fact”. It is 
a way of organizing knowledge. Even 
the disorderly knowledge that lurks 
inside a science-fiction writer’s brain 
can be organized. 

Suppose we take that kind of 
knowledge — a sketchy notion of 
nuclear physics, some stellar ballis-

tics, a lot of rule-of-thumb sociolog 3 ^ 
bits and smatterings of a thousand 
disciplines. Suppose we apply to it 
not the dramatic craft of the writer, 
but the problem-solving techniques 
of the scientist. Can we then come 
out with predictions about the fu- 
ture which share the good features 
of both approaches and the faults 
of neither? 

Two West Coast scientists con- 
nected with the RAND Corporation 
are trying. And it looks as though 
they are succeeding, at least in part. 

T heir names are Theodore J. Gor- 
don and Olaf Helmer. Gordon, 
a RAND consultant, spends most of 
his time supervising the Douglas 
Aircraft Saturn project. Dr. Helmer 
is a RAND Senior Mathematician. 
Their thesis is that although ‘‘the” 
future cannot infallibly be predicted, 
all futures are invented — in the 
sense that what will happen tomor- 
row will come from what is happen- 
ing today. 

Since “what is happening today” 
does not lend itself readily to quan- 
tification, or even to observation — 
so much of it is going on in some- 
one’s head — their approach to the 
basic data is informal. They selected 
a panel of knowledgeable people, 
most of them scientists (a couple 
of them also science-fiction writers, 
like Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asi- 
mov). They asked them their opin- 
ions on whether certain “break- 
throughs” could be accomplished, and 
if SO, when. They collated the re- 
sults and returned the information 
to the panel to iget a second approx- 
imation; collated that, and repeated 
the process. 

The panel was encouraged to com- 



ment and criticize at every stage, 
and the feedback from the panel was 
used to sharpen the questions and 
even to eliminate some of them. In 
the sharpening process some useful 
thinking was done. For example, 
one question was first asked in the 
form of a prediction of a date for 
“computing machines becoming the 
most significant intelligence on 
earth.” In the second stage it was 
changed to “availability of a ma- 
chine which comprehends standard 
IQ tests and scores above 150;” and 
by the last round a qualification was 
added to that: “. where ‘compre- 
hend’ is to be interpreted behavior- 
istically as the ability to respond 
questions printed in English and 
possibly accompanied by diagrams.” 

(The predicted median date for 
this machine, by the way, was 1990 ! ) 

Some of the other predicted medi- 
an dates were: 

1972 = Automated language trans- 
lators. 

1980 = Operation of a central data 
storage facility with wide access for 
general or specialized information 
retrieval. 

1985 = Manned landing on Mars 
and return. 

2025 = International agreements 
which guarantee certain economic 
minima to the world’s population 
as a result of high production from 
automation. 

In all some twenty-odd questions 
or more were asked in each of six 
areas. In some oases the basic ques- 
tion as to a forecast of probable 
dates (defined as an estimate of a 
date on which the given event will 
have a 50% probability of becoming 
fact) could not apply to the sort of 
information desired. For example.

IF 




the panels were questioned as to 
their opinions of the likelihood of 
all-out war, and as to how they 
thought such a war might break out. 
11% replied through inadvertence; 
45% through escalation of a political 
crisis; 37% through escalation of 
the level of violence in an on-going 
minor war; and only 7% thought 
it might occur through surprise at- 
tack when there is no ostensible 
acute crisis. (But the panel does 
not, in fact, think there will be any 
all-out war in the next twenty-five 
years, at least. And they are be- 
coming more sure rather than less. 
In one questionnaire, the median 
expectancy of such a war was 
22^%; six months later, it had 
dropped to 20%.) 

O f course, what is really of major 
interest in this study (published 
by the Rand Corporation, by the 
way, as Report on a Long-Range 
Forecasting Study) is not so much 
any specific prediction as the meth- 
od employed. Is it really better than 
either the straight-line extrapolation 
of the ordinary igovemmental sta- 
tistical agency or the free-wheeling 
guesses of science-fiction writers? 

We won’t know for sure until the 
future is upon us, of course. But 
there are some indications to be 
sought fbr — and found. 

For example, some of the ques- 
tions asked of the panel were self- 
checking. Estimates were asked as 
to population levels at future dates, 
and also as to rates of growth. 
Clearly one can be converted into 
the other; and when curves were 
drawn according to each of the two 
procedures and superimposed, they 
were found to be identical. 



Again, if the cascade process real- 
ly resulted in more accurate esti- 
mates it should show not only a more 
exact date but a reduced scatter of 
guesses that are higher and lower 
than the medium — and in fact, it 
did. 

Of course, both these things could 
result either from a more ^accurate 
guess or from a more unified agree- 
ment to make a wrong guess. Is 
there any way ta decide which? 

One way to try to find out would 
be to apply the same procedure to 
asking questions which have known 
answers — known, that is, to the 
asker, but presumably not to the 
panel. You might, for example, sav 
that the median name in the tele- 
phone book listings for one city is 
“Lawrence”, and ask how many 
pages before or after the median 
that name would be found in the 
listings for another given city. Or 
you might ask about a fact which is 
clearly checkable, but which most 
people do not carry around in their 
memories — for example, the lumber 
production of the state of Oregon 
for the year 1962, in board feet. 

So that was done, following the 
same procedures. 

And the result? 

The median was not always right 
— sometimes it was far off, in some 
cases it was bang on. But the median 
was more accurate than the guesses 
of any individual panelist, 

Sound like they’ve got something 
here? 

We think so. And we think you’ll 
be hearing more about this “Delphi” 
method of long-range forecasting!

kingdom. To a casual observer, his 
seamed, deeply taimed face would 
have appeared expressionless — but 
those wiho knew him well could 
have read a certain regret in the 
lines of his craggy features, in the 
almost imperceptible softening of 
the hard, slate-gray eyes. 

The king had abdicated. 

The Astronauticai Superintendent 
of Rim Runners had resigned from 
the service of the Rim Worlds Con- 
federacy — ^both as a senior executive 
of the government owned and oper- 
ated shipping line and as Commo- 
dore of the Rim Worlds Naval Re- 
serve. His resignations were not yet 
effective — ^but they would be, as 
soon as Captain Trantor, in Rim 
Kestrel, came dropping down 
through the overcast, to be relieved 
of his minor command prior to as- 
suming the greater one. 

On a day such as this there was 
little for Grimfes to see. Save for 
Faraway Quest, the Rim Worlds 
Government Survey Ship, and for 
Rim Mamelute the spaceport was 
deserted. Soon enough it would 
resume its normal activity, with 
units of the Rim Runners’ fleet roar- 
ing in through the cloud blanket, 
from Faraway, Ultimo and Thule, 
from the planets of the Eastern 
Circuit, firom the anti-matter sys- 
tems of the Galactic West. (And 
among them would be Trantor’s 
ship, inbound from Mellise.) But 
now there were only the old Quest 
and thte httle, battered spacetug in 
port, silent and deserted, the survey 
ship a squat, gray tower (that looked 
as thou^ it should have been lich- 
en-coated), half obscured by die 



snow squall, the Mamelute huddling 
at its base as though seeking shelter 
in the lee of the larger vessel. 

Grimes sighed, only half aware 
that he had done so. 

He was not a sentimental man. 
It was just that Faraway Quest had 
been his last spacegoing command 
and would be his last command, 
ever, out on the Rim. In her he had 
charted the worlds of the Eastern 
Circuit and opened them up to 
trade. In her he had made the first 
contact with the people of the anti- 
matter systems. In her, only short 
weeks ago, with a 'mixed crew of 
Rim Worlds Naval Reserve officers 
and Federation Survey Service per- 
sonnel, he had tried to solve the 
mystery of those weird and some- 
times frightening phenomena known 
as Rim Ghosts. And whilst on this 
wild Ghost Chase (as his second in 
command referred to it) he had 
found in Sonya Verrill the cure for 
his loneliness — as she had found, in 
him, the cure for hers. 

He started as the little black box 
on his desk buzzed. He heard a 
sharp female voice announce, “Com- 
mander Verrill to see you, Com- 
modore Grimes.” 

Another voice, also female, pleas- 
antly contralto but with an under- 
lying snap of authority, corrected 
the first speaker. **Mrs, Grimes to 
see the Commodore, Miss Willough- 
by.” 

“Come in, Sonya,” said Grimes, 
addressing the instrument. 

S he strode into the office, dra- 
matic as always. Melting snow 
crystals sparkled like diamonds on

her swirling, high-cx>llared doak of 
dull crimson Altairian crystal silk, 
in the Intricate coronet of her pale 
blonde hair. Her face was flushed, 
as much by excitement as by the 
warmth of the building after the 
bitter cold outside. She was a tall 
woman and a splendid one, and 
many men on many worlds had 
called her beautiful. 

She reached out, grabbed Grimes 
by his slightly protuberant ears, 
pulled his face to hers and kissed 
him soundly. 

After she had released him, he 
asked mildly, “And what was that 
in aid of, my dear?” 

She laughed happily. “John, I just 
had to come to tell you the news in 
person. It wouldn’t have been the 
same over the telephone. I’ve just 
received two Carlottigrams from 
Earth — one official, one personal. 
To begin with, my resignation’s ef- 
fective, as from today. Oh, I can 
still be called back in an emergency, 
but that shouldn’t worry us. And my 
gratuity has been approved.” 

“How much?” he asked, not al- 
together seriously. 

She told him. 

He whistled softly. “The Feder- 
ation’s more generous than the Con- 
federacy. But, of course, your tax- 
payers are richer than ours, and 
there are so many more of them — ” 
She ignored ttds. “And that’s not 
all, my dear. Admiral Salversen, of 
the Bureau of Supply, is an old 
friend of mine. He sent a personal 
message along with the other. It 
seems that there’s a little one-ship 
company for sale, just a feeder line 
running between Montalbon and 



Carribea. The gratuity ibarely cov- 
ers the down payment — >but with 
your gratuity, and our savings, and 
the profits we’re bound to make we 
shall be out of the red in no time 
at all. Just think of it, John! You as 
Owner-Master, and myself as your 
everloving Mate!” 

Grimes thought of it ^ he turned 
to stare again out of the wide win- 
dow, his mind’s eye piercing the dis-. 
mal overcast to the nothingness be- 
yond. Light, and warmth, and a sky 
ablaze with stars instead of this 
bleak desolation .... 

Light, and warmth .... 

And a milk run. 

And Sonya. 

He said slowly, “We may find it 
hard to settle down. Even you. 
You’re not a Rimworlder, but your 
life, in the Federation’s Naval Intel- 
ligence, has been adventurous, and 
you’ve worked out on the Rim so 
much that you almost qualify for 
citizenship.” 

“I qualified for citizenship when 
I married you. And I want to settle 
down, John. But not here.” 

The black box on the desk crack- 
led, then said in Miss Willoughby’s 
voice, “Port Control is calling. Com- 
modore Grimes. Shall I put them 
through?” 

“Yes, please,” Grimes told her.

^ “Yes, Captain Cassidy?” 

“Orbital Station 3 reports a ship,

“Isn’t that one of the things 
they’re paid for?” asked Grimes.

“Yes, sir.” Cassidy’s voice was 
sulky. “But there’s nothing due for 
almost a week, and — ” 

“Probably one of the Federation 
Survey Service wagons,” Grimes 
told him, flashing a brief smile 
(which she answered with a glare) 
at Sonya. “They think they can 
come and go as they damn well 
please. Tell Station 3 to demand — 
demand not request — identifica- 
tion.” 

“The Station Commander has al- 
ready done that, Commodore. But 
there’s no reply.” 

“And Station 3 doesn’t nm to a 
Psionic Radio Officer.” He paused, 
then asked, “Landing approach?” 

“No, sir. Station 3 hasn’t had 
time to extrapolate her trajectory 
yet, hut the way she’s heading now 
it looks as though she’ll miss Lorn 
by all of a thousand miles and finish 
up in the sun.” 

“They haven’t had time?” 
Grimes’s voice was cold. “What the 
hell sort of watch are they keep- 
ing?” 

“A good one, sir. Commander 
Hall is one of our 'best men — as you 
know. It seems that this ship just ap- 
peared out of nothing — those were 
Hall’s own words. There was no 
warning at all on the Mass Proxim- 
ity Indicator. And then, suddenly, 
there she was on both M.P.I. and 
radar.” 

“Any of* your people loafing 
around these parts?” Grimes asked 
Sonyat 

“No,” she told him. “At least, not 
that I know of.” 

“H’m.” He turned again to the 
box. “Captain Cassidy, tell Station 



3 that I wish direct communications 
with them.” 

“Very good, sir.” 

The Commodore strode to his 
desk, sat down in his chair, pulled 
out a drawer. His stubby fin'gers 
played over the console that was 
revealed. Suddenly the window went 
O'paque, and as it did so the lights 
in his office dimmed to a faint glow. 
One wall of the room came alive, a 
swirl of light and color that coal- 
esced to form a picture, three di- 
mensional, of the Watch House of 
Station 3. There were the wide 
ports, beyond the thick transparen- 
cies of which was the utter black- 
ness of Space as seen from the Rim 
Worlds, a blackness made even 
more intense by contrast with the 
faintly glimmering nebulosities, 
sparse and dim, that were the dis- 
tant, unreachable island universes. 
Within the compartment were the 
blanked instruments, the flickering 
screens, the warped, convoluted col- 
umns, each turning slowly on its 
axis, that were the hunting anten- 
nae of the Carlotti Beacon. Uni- 
formed men and women busied 
themselves at control panels, stood 
tensely around the big plotting tank. 

One of them — the Station Com- 
mander — turned to face the camera. 
He asked, “Have you the picture. 
Commodore, Grimes, sir?” 

“I have. Commander,” Grimes 
told him. “How is the extrapolation 
of trajectory?” 

“You may have a close-up of the 
tank, sir.” 

T he scene dissolved, and then 
only the . plotting tank was in

Grimes’s screen. In tihe center of it 
was to duU-giowing (but not dull 
in iresd^ globe that represented 
to Jjom sun. And there was the 
ourving filament of light that rep- 
resented the orhit of the strange 
ship, the filament that extended it- 
self as Grimes and Sonya watched, 
that finally touched the ruddy in- 
candescence of the central sphere. 
This was only an extrapolation; it 
would be months before it actually 
occurred. There was still time, 
ample time, for the crew of the in- 
truder to pull her out of the fatal 
plunge. And yet, somehow, there 
was a sense of urgency. If a rescue 
operation were to be undertaken, it 
must be done without delay. A stem 
chase is a long chase. 

“What do you make of it?” 
Grimes asked Sonya. 

She said, “I don’t like it. Either 
they can’t communicate, or they 
won’t communicate. And I think 
they can’t. There’s something wrong 
with that ship.” 

“Something very wrong. Get hold 
of Cassidy, will you? Tell him that 
I want Rim Mamelute ready for 
Space as soon as possible.” He 
stared at the screen, upon which 
Commander Hall had made a reap- 
pearance. “We’re sending the Mam- 
elute out after her, Hall. Meanwhile, 
keep on trying to communicate.” 

“We are trying, sir.” 

Cassidy’s voice came from the 
black box, “Sir, Captain Welling, 
the skipper of the Mamelute, is in 
hospital. Shall I — ?” 

“No, Cassidy. Somebody has to 
mind the shop — and you’re elected. 
But there’s something you can do 



for me. Get hold of Mr. Mayhcw, 
the Psionic Radio Officer. Yes, yes, 
I know that he’s taking his Long 
Service Leave, but get hold of 'him. 
Tell him I want him here, complete 
with his amplifier, as soon as pos- 
sible, if not before. And get Mame- 
lute cleared away.” 

“But who’s taking her out, sir?” 

“Who do you think? Get crack- 
ing, Cassidy.” 

“You’ll need a Mate,” said Son- 
ya. 

He found time to tease her, saying 
“Rather a comedown from the 
Federation Survey Service, my 
dear.” 

“Could be. But I have a feeling 
that this may be a job for an intel- 
ligence Officer.” 

“You’ll sign on as Mate,” he told 
her firmly. 

Ill 

R im Mamelute as a salvage tug 
was already in a state of near- 
readiness. She was fully fueled and 
provisioned; all that remained to be 
done was the mustering of her per- 
sonnel. Her engineers, pottering 
around in Rim Runners’ workshop 
on the spaceport premises, were eas- 
ily located. The Port Doctor was 
conscripted from his office and was 
pleased enough to be pulled away 
from his boring paperwork. The 
Port Signal Station supplied a Radio 
Officer and — for Rim Mamelute^s 
permanent Mate made it plain that 
he would resent being left out of 
the party — Sonya agreed to come 
along as Catering Officer. 

Grimes could have got the little

brute upstairs within an hour of his 
setting the wheels in motion, but he 
insisted on waiting for Mayhew. In 
any salvage job oommunication be- 
tween the salvor and the salved is 
essential — and to judge by the ex- 
perience of Station 3 any form of 
deotronic radio commiunication was 
out. He stood on the concrete, just 
outside the tug’s airlock, looking up 
at the overcast sky. Sonya came out 
to join him. 

“Damn the man!” he grumbled. 
“He’s supposed to be on his way. 
He was told it was urgent.” 

She said, “I hear something.” 

He heard it too, above the thin 
whine of the wind, a deepening 
drone. Then the helicopter came in- 
to sight above the high roof of the 
Administration Building, the jet 
flames at the tip of its rotor blades 
a bright, -'blue circle against the gray 
sky. It dropped slowly, carefully, 
making at last a landing remarkable 
for its gentleness. The cabin door 
op>ened, and the tall, gangling tele- 
path,* his thin face pasty against the 
upturned collar of his dark coat, 
clambered to the ground. He saw 
Grimes, made a slovenly salute, 
then turned to receive the large case 
that was handed him by the pilot. 

“Take your time,” growled 
Grimes. 

Mayhew shuffled around to face 
the Commodore. He set the case 
carefully down on the ground, pat- 
ted it gently. He said, mild reproof 
in his voice, “Lassie’s not as used to 
travelling as she was. I try to avoid 
shaking her up.” 

Grimes sighed. He had almost 
forgotten about the peculiar relation- 



ship that existed between the space- 
faring telepaths and their amplifiers 
— the living brains of dogs suspend- 
ed in their tanks of nutrient solu- 
tion. It was far more intense than 
that existing between normal man 
and normal dog. When a naturally 
telepathic animal is deprived of its 
body, its psionic powers are vastly 
enhanced, and it will recognize as 
friend and master only a telepathic 
man. There is symbiosis, on a psion- 
ic level. 

“Lassie’s not at all well,” com- 
plained Mayhew. 

“Think her up a nice juicy bone,” 
Grimes almost said, then thought 
better of it. 

“I’ve tried that, of course,” May- 
hew told him. “But she’s not . 
she’s just not interested any more. 
She’s growing old. And since the 
Carlotti system was introduced no- 
body is making psionic amplifiers 
any more.” 

“Is she functioning?” asked the 
Commodore coldly. 

“Yes, sir. But—” 

“Then get aboard, Mr. Mayhew. 
Mrs. Grimes will show you to your 
quarters. Prepare and secure for 
blastoff without delay.” 

H e stamped up the short ramp 
into the airlock, climbed the 
ladders to the little control room. 
The Mate was already in the co- 
pilot’s chair, his ungainly posture a 
match for his slovenly uniform. 
Grimes looked at him with some dis- 
taste, but he knew that the burly 
young man was more than merely 
competent. Although his manner 
and appearance militated against his 



14 



IP 




employment in a big ship he was 
ideally suited to service in a sal- 
vage tug. 

“Ready as soon as you are, Skip- 
per,” the Mate said. “You takin’ 
her up?” 

“You’re more used to this vessel 
than I am, Mr. Williams. As soon 
as all’s secure you may blastoff.” 
“Good-oh, Skip.” 

Grimes watched the indicator 
lights, listened to the verbal reports, 
aware that Williams was doing like- 
wise. Then he said into the trans- 
ceiver microphone, **Rim Mamelute 
to Port Control. Blasting off.” 
Before Port Control could ac- 
knowledge, Williams hit the firing 
key. Not for the Mamelute the rel- 
atively leisurely ascent, the relative- 
ly gentle acceleration of the big 
ships. It was, thought Grimes daz- 
edly, like being fired from a gun. 
Almost at once, it seemed, harsh 
sunlight burst through the control 
room ports. He tried to move his 
fingers against the crushing weight, 
tried to bring one of them to the 
button set in the arm rest of his 
chair that controlled the polariza- 
tion of the transparencies. T^e glare 
was beating full in his face, painful 
even through his closed eyelid. But 
Williams^ beat him to it. When 
Grimes opened his eyes, he saw that 
the Mate was grinning at him. 

“She’s a tough little bitch, the old 
Mamelute” announced the objec- 
tionable young man with pride. 

“Yes, Mr. Williams,” enunciated 
Grimes with difficulty. “But there 
are some of us who aren’t as tough 
as the ship. And, talking of lady 
dogs, I don’t think that Mr. May- 



hew’s amplifier can stand much ac- 
celeration.” 

“That pickled poodle’s, brain. 
Skip? The animal’s better off than 
we are, floatin’ in its nice, warm 
bath o’ thick soup.” He grinned 
again. “But I was forgettin’. We. 
haven’t the regular crew this time. 
What say we maintain a nic€, steady 
one and a half G’s? That do yer?” 

One G would be better, thought 
Grimes. After all, those young 
people, whoever they are, are in no 
irnmediate danger of falling into the 
sun .... But perhaps even a few 
minutes* delay might make all the 
difference between life and death to 
them. Even so, we must be capable 
of doing work, heavy, physical 
work, when we catch them. 

“Yes, Mr. Williams,” he said 
slowly. “Maintain one and a half 
gravities. You’ve fed the elements 
of the trajectory into the computer, 
of course?” 

“Of course. Skip. Soon as I have 
her round I’ll put her on auto. She’ll 
be right.” 

W hen the tug had settled down 
on her long chase. Grimes left 
Williams in the control room and 
went down into the body of the 
ship. He made his rounds, satisfied 
himself that all was well in the en- 
gine room, surgery, the two com- 
munications offices and, finally, the 
galley. Sonya was standing up to 
acceleration as though she had been 
born and bred on a high gravity 
planet. He looked at her with envy 
as she poured him a cup of coffee, 
handing it to him without any ob- 
vious compensation for its increased 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



15 




weight. Then she snapped at him, 
“Sit down, John. If you’re as tired 
as you look you’d better lie down.” 
He said, “I’m all right.” 

“You’re not,” she told him. “And 
there’s no need for you to put on 
the big, tough space-captain act in 
front of me.” 

“If you can stand it — ” 

“What if I can, my dear? I 
haven’t led such a sheltered life as 
you have. I’ve knocked around in 
little ships more than I have in big 
ones, and I’m far more used to go- 
ing places in a hurry than you.” 

He lowered himself to a bench, 
and she sat beside him. He sipped 
his coffee, then asked her, “Do you 
think, then, that we should be in 
more of a hurry?” 

“Frankly, no. Salvage work is 
heavy work, and if we maintain 
more than one and a half G’s over a 
quite long period we shall all of us 
be too tired to function properly, 
even that tough Mate of yours.” She 
smiled. “I mean the Mate who’s on 
Articles as such, not the one you’re 
married to.” 

He chuckled. “But she’s tough, 
too.” 

“Only when I have to be, my 
dear.” 

Grimes looked at her and 
thought of the old proverb which 
says that there is many a true word 
spoken in- jest. 

. IV 

T he strange vessel was a slowly 
expanding speck of light in the 
globular screen of the Mass Prox- 
imity Indicator; it was a gradually 



brightening blip on Mamelute' s 
radar display that seemed as though 
it were being drawn in toward the 
tug by the ever decreasing spiral of 
the range marker. 

Clearly it showed up on the in- 
struments, although it was still too 
far distant for visual sighting. It 
was obvious that the extrapolation 
of trajectory made by Station 3 was 
an accurate one. It was falling free, 
neither accelerating nor decelerat- 
ing, its course determined only by 
the gravitational forces within the 
Lorn Star’s planetary system. Left 
to itself it must inevitably fall into 
the sun. But long before its shell 
plating began to heat it would be 
overhauled by the salvage ship and 
dragged away from its suicide orbit. 

And it was silent. It made no re- 
ply to the signals beamed at it from 
Rim Mamelute*s powerful transmit- 
ter. Bennett, the Radio Officer, com- 
plained to Grimes, “I’ve tried every 
frequency known to civilized man 
and a few that aren’t. But, so far, no 
joy.” 

“Keep on trying,” Grimes told 
him, then went to the cabin that 
Mayhew, the telepath, shared with 
his organic amplifier. 

The Psionic Radio Officer was 
slumped in his chair, staring vacant- 
ly at the glass tank in which, im- 
mersed in its cloudy nutrient fluid, 
floated the obscenely naked brain. 
The Commodore tried to ignore the 
thing. It made him uneasy. Every 
time that he saw one of the ampli- 
fiers he could not help wondering 
what it would be like to be disem- 
bodied, deprived of all external 
stimuli but the stray thoughts of 



16 



IF 




other, more fortunate (or less un- 
fortunate) beings — and those 
thoughts, as like as not, on an in- 
comprehensible level. What would a 
man do were he so used, his brain 
removed from his skull and em- 
ployed by some race of superior be- 
ings for their own fantastic pur- 
poses? Go mad, probably. And did 
the dogs sacrificed so that Man 
could communicate with his fellows 
over the light-years ever go mad? 

“Mr. Mayhew,” he said. 

“Sir?” muttered the telepath. 

“As far as electronic radio is con- 
cerned that ship is dead.” 

“Dead,” repeated Mayhew in a 
thin whisper. 

“Then you think that there’s no- 
body alive on board her?” 

“I ... I don’t know. I told you 
before we started that Lassie’s not 
a well dog. She’s old. Commodore. 
She dreams almost all of the time. 
She . she just ignores me.” His 
voice was louder as he defended his 
weird pet against the imputation 
that he had made himself. “It’s just 
that she’s old, and her mind is get- 
ting very dim. Just vague dreams 
and ghostly memories, and the past 
more real than the present, even 
so.” 

“What sort of dreams?” asked 
Grimes' stirred to pity for that 
naked canine brain in its glass can- 
nister. 

“Hunting dreams, mainly. She 
was a terrier, you know, before she 
was . conscripted. Hunting 

dreams. Chasing small animals, like 
rats. They’re good dreams, except 
when they turn to nightmares. And 
then I have to wake her up — hut 



she’s in such a state of terror that 
she’s no good for anything.” 

“I didn’t think that dogs have 
nightmares,” remarked Grimes. 

“Oh, but they do, sir, they do. 
Poor Lassie always has the same one 
— about an enormous rat that’s just 
about to kill her. It must be some 
old memory of her puppy days, 
when she ran up against such an 
animal, a big one, bigger than she 
was . .” 

“H’m. And meanwhile, nothing 
from the ship.” 

“Nothing at all, sir.” 

“Have you tried transmitting, as 
well as just maintaining a listening 
watch?” 

“Of course, sir.” Maiyhew’s voice 
was pained. “During Lassie’s lucid 
moments I’ve been punching out a 
strong signal, strong enough even to 
be picked up by nontelepaiths. You 
must have felt it yourself, sir. Help 
is on the way. But there’s been no 
indication of mental acknowledg- 
ment.” 

“All we know about the ship, 
Mayhew, is that she seems to be a 
derelict. We don’t know who built 
her. We don’t know who mans her 
— or manned her.” 

“Anybody who builds a ship, sir, 
must be able to think.” 

Grimes, remembering some of the 
unhandier vessels in which he had 
served in his youth, said, “Not 
necessarily.” 

Mayhew, not getting the point in- 
sisted, “But they must be able to 
think. And, in order to think, you 
must have a brain to think with. 
And any brain at all emits psionic 
radiation. Furthermore, sir, such 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



17 




radiation sets up secondary radiation 
in the inanimate surroundings of 
the brain. What is the average haunt 
but a psionic record on the walls of 
a house in which strong emotions 
have been let loose? A record that is 
played back given the right condi- 
tions.” 

“H’m. But you say that the dere- 
lict is psionically dead, that there’s 
not even a record left by her build- 
ers, or her crew, to be played back 
to you.” 

“The range is still extreme, sir. 
And as for this secondary psionic 
radiation, sir, sometimes it fades 
rapidly, sometimes it lingers for 
years.” 

“So there could be something.” 

“There could be, sir. And there 
could not.” 

“Just go on trying, Mr. Mayhew.” 

“Of course, sir. But with poor 
Lassie in her present state I can’t 
promise anything.” 

G rimes went along to the galley. 

He seated himself on the 
bench, accepted the cup of coffee 
that Sonya poured for him. He said, 
“It looks, my dear, as though we 
shall soon be needing an Intelligence 
Officer as well as a Catering Of- 
ficer.” 

“Why?” she asked. 

He told her of his conversation 
with Maylxew. He said, “I’d hoped 
that he’d be able to find us a few 
shorj cuts, but his crystal ball 
doesn’t seem to be functioning very 
well these days. If you could call 
that poodle’s brain in aspic a crystal 
ball.” 

“He’s told me all about it,” she 



said. “He’s told everybody in the 
ship all about it. But once we get 
the derelict in tow and opened up, 
we shall soon be able to find out 
what makes her tick.” 

“I’m not so sure, Sonya. The way 
in which she suddenly appeared 
from nowhere, not even a trace on 
Station 3’s M.P.I. beforehand, 
makes me think that she could be 
very, very alien.” 

“The Survey Service is used to 
dealing with aliens,” she told him. 
“The Inteliigence Branch especial- 
ly so.” 

“I know, I know.” 

“And now, as I’m still only the 
humble galley slave, can I presume 
to ask my lord and master the 
E.T.C.?” 

“Unless something untoward 
fouls things up, E.T.C. should be in 
almost exactly five Lorn Standard 
Days from now.” 

“And then it will be Boarders 
AwayT she said, obviously relishing 
the prospect. 

“Boarders Away!” he agreed. 
“And I, for one, shall be glad to get 
out of this space^bome sardine can.” 
“Frankly,” she said, “I shall be 
even gladder to get out of this 
bloody galley so that I can do the 
real work for which I was trained.” 

V 

S lowly the range closed, until the 
derelict was visible as a tiny, 
bright star a few degrees to one side 
of the Lorn Sun. The range closed, 
and Rim Mamelute*s powerful tele- 
scope was brought into play. 

It showed very little. The strange 



18 



IF 




ship appeared to be an almost fea- 
tureless spindle, the surface of its hull 
unbroken by vanes, sponsons or an- 
tennae. And still, now thait the dis- 
tance could be measured in scant 
tens of miles, the alien construction 
was silent, making no reply to the 
signals directed at it by both the sal- 
vage tug’s communications officers. 

Grimes sat in the little control 
room, letting Williams handle the 
ship. The Mate crouched in his 
chair, intent upon his telltale instru- 
ments, nudging the tug closer and 
closer to the free-falling ship with 
carefully timed rocket blasts, match- 
ing velocities with the skill that 
comes only from long practice. He 
looked up briefly from his console 
to speak to Grimes. “She’s bloody 
hot, Skipper.’’ 

“We’ve radiation armor,” said 
Grimes. The words were question 
rather than statement. 

“O’ course. The Mamelute's ready 
for anything. Remember the Rim 
Eland disaster? Her pile went crit- 
ical. We brought her in. I boarded 
her when we took her in tow, just 
in case there was anybody still liv- 
ing. There wasn’t. It was like bein’ 
inside a radioactive electric fryin’ 
pan.” 

A charming simile, thought 
Grimes. 

He used the big, mounted binoc- 
ulars to study the derelict. They 
showed him little more than the tele- 
scope at longer range. So she was 
radioactive. It seemed that the 
atomic blast that had initiated the 
radiation had come from outside, 
not inside. There were, after all, 
protuberances upon that hull, but 



they had been melted and rehard- 
ened, like guttering candle wax. 
There were the remains of what must 
have been vaned landing gear. There 
was the stump of w'hat could have 
been, once, a mast of some kind, 
similar to the retractable masts of 
the spaceships with which Grimes 
was familiar, the supports for De^ 
radio antennae and radar scanners. 

“Mr. Williams,” he -ordered, 
“we’ll make our approach from the 
other side of the derelict.” 

“You’re the boss. Skipper.” 

Brief accelerations crushed 
Grimes down into the padding of 
his chair; centrifugal force, as 
Mamelute*s powerful gyroscopes 
turned her about her short axis, 
made him giddy. Almost he re- 
gretted having embarked upon this 
chase in person. He was not used 
to small ships, to the violence of 
their motions. He heard, from some- 
where below, a crash of kitchen- 
ware. He hoped that Sonya had not 
been hurt. 

She had not been — not physical- 
ly, at any rate. Somehow, even 
though the tug was falling free once 
more, she contrived to stamp into 
the control room. She was pale with 
temper, and the smear of some rich, 
brown sauce on her right cheek ac- 
centuated her pallor. She glared at 
her husiband and demanded, “What 
the hell’s going on? Can’t you give 
us some warning before indulging 
in a bout of astrobatics?” 

Williams chuckled to himself and 
made some remark about the un- 
wisdom of amateurs shipping out in 
space tugs. She turned on him then 
and said that she had served in tugs

owned by Federation Survey Serv- 
ice and tbat (they ihiad been, liike all 
Federation starships, taut ^ps, and 
that any officer who failed to warn 
all departments of impending man- 
euvers would soon find himself bust- 
ed down to Spaceman, Third Oass. 

Before the Mate could make an 
angry reply Grimes intervened. He 
said smoothly, “It was my fault, 
Sonya. But I was so interested in 
the derelict that I forgot to renew 
the alarm. After all, it was sounded 
as we began our approach.” 

“I know that. But I was prepared 
for an approach, not his tumbling 
all over the sky like a drunken bat.” 
“Once again. I’m sorry. But now 
you’re here, grab yourself the spare 
chair and sit down. This is the sit- 
uation. All the evidence indicates 
that there’s been some sort of 
atomic explosion. That ship is hot. 
But I think that the blast was from 
outside, not inside. I think that the 
other side of the hull will be rel- 
atively undamaged — ” 

“It is,” grunted Williams. 

T he three of them stared out of 
the viewports. The shell plat- 
ing, seen from this angle, was dull, 
not bright, pitted with the tiny pores 
that were evidence of frequent pas- 
sages through swarms of micro- 
meteorites. At the stem, one wide 
vane stood* out sharp and clear in 
the glare of Mamelute's searchlights. 
Forward, the armor screens over the 
control room ports were obviously 
capable of being retracted, were not 
fused to the hull. There were spon- 
sons from which projected the muz- 
zles of weapons — they could have 



been cannon or laser projectors, 
but what little was visible was utter- 
ly unfamiliar. There was a telescope 
mast, atop which was a huge, frag- 
ile-seeniing radar scanner, motion- 
less. 

And just abaft the sharp stem was 
the name. 

No, thought Grimes, studying the 
derelict through the binoculars, two 
names. 

It was the huge, sprawling letters, 
crude daubs of black paint, that he 
read first. FREEDOM, tiiey spelled. 
Then there were the other symbols, 
gold-embossed, half obscured by the 
dark pigment. 

There was something wrong about 
them, a subtle disproportion, an 
oddness of spacing. But they made 
sense — after a while. They did not 
belong to the alphabet with which 
Grimes was familiar, but they must 
have been derived from it. There 
was the triangular “D”, the “I” 
that was a fat, upright oblong, the 
serpentine “S”. '*Distroyir . 
muttered Grimes. ** Destroyer?** He 
passed the glasses, on their univer- 
sal mount, to Sonya. “What do you 
make of this? What branch of the 
human race prints like that? What 
people have simplified their alpha- 
bet by getting rid of the letter 
‘E’?” 

She adjusted the focus to suit her 
own vision. She said at last, “That 
painted-on name is the work of 
human hands all right. But the 
other ... I don’t know. I’ve never 
seen anything like it before. There’s 
a certain lack of logicality — ^human 
logicality, that is. Oh, that stylized 
‘D’ is logical enough. But the sub- 



20 



IF 




stitution of ‘I’ for ‘E’ — it is a sub- 
stitution .... And then, as far as 
we are concerned, a destroyer is a 
class of ship, not a ship’s name.” 

“I seem to recall,” Grimes told 
her, “that there was once a war- 
ship called Dreadnought — and the 
dreadnoughts have been a class of 
warship ever since the first iron- 
clads were launched on Earth’s 
seas.” 

“All right, Mr. amateur naval his- 
torian — but have you ever, in the 
course of your very wide reading on 
your favorite subject, come across 
mention of a ship called Destroyer — 
and spelled without a single ‘E’? 
There are nonhumans mixed up in 
this somewhere. Highly intelligent 
nonhumans at that.” 

“And humans,” said Grimes. 
“But we’ll never find out any- 
thing just by talking about it,” 
grumbled the Mate. “An’ the soon- 
er we take this bitch in tow, the 
shorter the long drag back to Port 
Forlorn. I’m make fast alongside — 
but even here, in the blast shadow, 
that hull is too damn hot. It’ll have 
to be tow wires from the outriggers 
— an’ keep our fingers crossed that 
they don’t get cut by our exhaust.” 
“Take her in tow, then board,” 
said Sonya. 

“O’ coursd. First things first. 
There’ll be nobody alive inside that 
radioactive can.” 

T he intercommunication tele- 
phone was buzzing furiously. 
Grimes picked up the instrument. 
“Commodore here.” 

“Mayhew, sir.” The telepath’s 
voice was oddly muffled. He sound- 



ed as though he had been crying. 
“It’s Lassie, sir. She’s dead.” 

A happy release, thought Grimes. 
But what am I supposed to do about 
it? 

“One of her nightmares, sir,” 
Mayhew babbled on. “I was inside 
her mind, and I tried to awaken 
her. But I couldn’t. There was this 
huge rat — and there were the 
sharp yellow teeth of it; and ti e 
stink of it ... It was so ... it was 
so real, so vivid. And it was the 
fear that killed her. I could feel her 
fear, and it was almost too much for 
me. 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Mayhew,” said 
Grimes inadequately. “I will see 
you later. But we are just about to 
take the derelict in tow, and we are 
busy.” 

“I understand, sir.” 

And then Grimes relaxed into the 
padding of his chair, watching, not 
without envy, as Williams jockeyed 
the salvage tug into position ahead 
of the derelict, then carefully match- 
ed velocity. The outriggers were ex- 
truded, and then there was the 
slighest shock as the little missiles, 
each with a powerful magnetic grap- 
nel as its warhead, were fired. 

Contact was made, and then Wil- 
liams, working with the utmost care, 
eased Rim Mamelute around in a 
great arc, never putting too much 
strain on the towing gear, always 
keeping the wires clear of the tug’s 
incandescent exhaust. It was pretty 
to watch. 

Even so, when at last it was over, 
when at last the Lorn Sitar was al- 
most directly astern, he could not 
resist the temptation of asking, “But 



EDGE OF NIGHT

why all this expenditure of reaction 
mass and time to ensure a bows- 
first tow, Mr. Williams?” 

“S.O.P., Skipper. It’s more con- 
venient if the people in the towed 
ship can see where they’re going.” 
“But it doesn’t look as though 
there are any people. Not live ones, 
that is.” 

“But we could be putting a prize 
crew aboard her, Skipper.” 

Grimes thought about saying 
something about the radio activity, 
then decided not to bother. 

“You just can’t win, John,” Son- 
ya told him. 

VI 

I n theory one can perform heavy 
work while clad in radiation 
armor. One can do so in practise 
— provided that one has been 
through a rigorous course of train- 
ing. Pendeen, Second Engineer of 
Rim Mamelute, had been so trained. 
So, of course, had been Mr. Wil- 
liams — but Grimes had insisted 
that the Mate stay aboard the tug 
while he, with Sonya and the en- 
gineer, effected an entry into the 
hull of the derelict. Soon, while the 
boarding party was making its ex- 
ploratory walk over the stranger 
ship’s shell plating, he had been 
obliged to order Williams to cut the 
drive; sufficient velocity had been 
built up so that both vessels were 
now in free fall away from the sun. 

Even in free fall it was bad 
enough. Every joint of the heavy suit 
was stiff, every limb had so much 
mass that great physical effort was 
required to conquer inertia. Weary 



and sweating heavily. Grimes forced 
himself to keep up with his two 
companions. By a great effort of will 
he contrived to maintain his side of 
the conversation in a voice that did 
not betray his poor physical condi- 
tion. 

He was greatly relieved when 
they discovered, towards the stern, 
what was obviously an airlock door. 
Just a hair thin crack in the plat- 
ing it was, outlining a circular port 
roughly seven feet in. diameter. 
There were no signs of external con- 
trols, and the crack was too thin 
to allow the insertion of any tool. 

“Send for the bell, sir?” asked 
Penden, his normally deep voice an 
odd treble in Grime’s helmet phones. 

“The bell? Yes, yes. Of course. 
Carry on, Mr. Pendeen.” 

“A1 to Bill,” Grimes heard. “Do 
you read me? Over.” 

“Bill to Al. Loud an’ clear. What 
can I do for you?” 

“We’ve found the airlock. But we 
want the bell.” 

“You would. Just stick around. 
It’U be over.” 

“And send the cutting gear while 
you’re about it.” 

“Will do. Stand by.” 

“Had any experience with the 
Laverton Bell, sir?” asked Pendeen, 
his voice not as respectful as it 
might have been. 

“No. Not actual working experi- 
ence, that is.” 

“I have,” said Sonya. 

“Good. Then you’ll know what 
to do when we get it.” 

Grimes, looking towards Rim 
Mamelute, could see that something 
bulky was coming slowly towards

them along one of the tow wires, 
the rocket that had given the packet 
its initial thrust long since burned 
out. He followed the others toward 
the stem of the derelict, but stood 
to one side, heJd to the plating by 
the magnetic soles of his boots, as 
they undipped the bundle from the 
line. He would have helped them 
to carry it back aft, but they ig- 
nored him. 

Back at the airlock valve, Sonya 
and Pendeen worked swiftly and 
competently, releasing the fasten- 
ings, unfolding what looked like a 
tent of tough white plastic. This had 
formed the wrapper for other things 
— including a gas 'bottle, a laser 
torch and a thick tube of adhesive. 
Without waiting for instructions, 
Sonya took this latter, removed the 
screw cap and, working on her 
hands and knees, used it to describe 
a glistening line just outside the 
crack that marked the door. Then 
all three of them, standing in the 
middle of the circle, lifted the fab- 
ric above their heads, unfolding it 
as they did so. Finally, with Grimes 
and Pendeen acting as tent poles, 
Sonya neatly fitted the edge of the 
shaped canopy to the ring of ad- 
hesive, now and again adding a fur- 
ther glob of the substance from the 
tube. 

“Stay as you are, sir,” the en- 
gineer said to Grimes, then fell to 
a squatting position. 

His gloved hands went to the gas 
cylinder, to the valve wheel. A 
white cloud jetted out like a rocket 
exhaust, then faded to invisibility. 
Around the boarding party the walls 
of the tent bellied outwards, slowly 



tautened, distended to their true 
shape by the expanding herium. 
Only toward the end was the hiss of 
the escaping gas very faintly audi- 
ble. 

Pendeen shut the valve decisively, 
saying, “That’s that. Is she all tight, 
Sonya?” 

“All tight, Al,” she replied. 

“Good.” With a greasy crayon he 
drew a circle roughly in the center 
of the airlock door, one large enough 
to admit a spacesuited body. He 
picked up the laser torch, directed 
its beam downwards, thumbed the 
firing button. The flare of vapor- 
izing metal was painfully bright, out- 
shining the helmet lights, reflected 
harshly from the white inner sur- 
face of the plastic igloo. 

There was the illusion of suf- 
focating heat — or was it more than 
only an illusion? Pendeen switched 
off the torch and straightened, look- 
ing down at the annulus of still- 
glowing metal. With an effort he 
lifted his right foot, breaking the 
contact of the magnetized sole with 
the plating. He brought the heel 
down sharply. The clang, transmit- 
ted through the fabric of their ar- 
mor, was felt rather than heard by 
the others. 

And then the circular plate was 
falling slowly, into the darkness of 
the airlock chamber, and the rough 
manhole was open so that they 
could enter. 

G rimes was first into the alien 
ship, followed by Sonya and 
then Pendeen. It was light enough 
in the little compartment once they 
were into it, the beams of their hel-

met lights ireflected from the white- 
pamted TVialls. On the inner door 
there was a set of manual controls 
that worked — once Grimes realiz- 
ed that the spindle of the wheel had 
a left-handed thread. Beyond the 
inner door there was an alleyway, 
and standing there was a man. 

The Commodore w'hipped the 
pistol from his holster, his reflexes 
more than compensating for the 
stiffness of the joints of his suit. 
Then, slowly, he retumed the 
weapon to his belt. 

This man was dead. Radiation 
may have killed him, but it had 
not killed all the bacteria of decay 
present in his body. Some freak of 
inertial and centrifugal forces, com- 
ing into play when the derelict had 
been taken in tow, had flung him 
to a standing posture, and the mag- 
netic soles of his rough sandals had 
held him to the deck. 

So he was dead, and he was de- 
composing, his skin taut and darkly 
purple, bulging over the waistband 
of the loincloth — it looked like 
sacking — that was his only cloth- 
ing. He was dead — and Grimes 
was suddenly grateful for the sealed 
suit that he was wearing, the suit 
that earlier he had been cursing, 
that kept out the stench of him. 

Gently, with pity and pointless 
tenderness, he put his gloved hands 
to the waist of the corpse, lifted it 
free of the deck, shifted it to one 
side.^ 

“We must be just about engine 
room level,” said Sonya, her voice 
deliberately casual. 

“Yes,” agreed Grimes. “I won- 
der if this ship has an axial shaft. 



If she has, it will be the quickest 
way of getting to the control room.” 

“That will be the best place to 
start investigations,” she said. 

They moved on through the al- 
leyway, using the free fall shuffle 
that was second nature to all of 
them, letting the homing instinct that 
is part of the nature of all space- 
men guide them. They found more 
bodies, women as well as men, 
spirawled in untidy attitudes, hang- 
ing like monstrous mermen and mer- 
women in a submarine 'cave. They 
tried to ignore them, as they tried 
to ignore the smaller bodies of chil- 
dren, and came at last, at the end 
of a short, radial alleyway, to the 
stout pillar of the axial shaft. 

There was a door in the pillar. 
It was open. 

One by one they passed through 
it and then began pulling themselves 
forward along the central guide rod, 
ignoring the spiral ramp that lined 
the tunnel. Finally they came to a 
conventional enough hatchway, but 
the valve sealing the end of the 
shaft was jammed. Grimes and Son- 
ya fell back to let Pendeen use the 
laser torch. Then they followed him 
into the control room. 

VII 

T here were more bodies in the 
control room. There were three 
dead men and three dead women, 
all of them strapped into accelera- 
tion chairs. Like all the others scat- 
tered throughout the ship they were 
clad only in rough, scanty rags, 
were swollen with decomposition. 
Grimes forced himself to ignore

IF 




them. He could do nothing for 
them. Perhaps, he thought, he might 
some day avenge them (somehow 
he did not feel that they had been 
criminals, pirates) — but that would 
not bring them back to life. 

He looked past the unsightly 
corpses to the instruments on the 
consoles before their oh airs. These, 
at first glance, seemed to be familiar 
enough — white dials with the black 
calibrations marked with Arabic 
numerals; red, green, white and am- 
ber pilot lights, dead now, but ready 
to blossom with glowing life at the 
restoration of a power supply. 
Familiar enough they were, at first 
glance. But there were the odd dif- 
ferences, the placement of various 
controls in positions that did not 
tally with the construction and the 
articulation of the normal human 
frame. And there was the lettering 
— MINNSCHINN DRIVI, RIM- 
rn CINTRIL. Who, he asked him- 
self, were the builders of this ^ip, 
this vessel that was almost a stand- 
ard Federation Survey Service cruis- 
er? What human race had jettisoned 
every vowel in the alphabet but this 
absurdly fat “I”? 

“John,” Sonya was saying, “give 
me a hand drill, will you?” 

He turned to see what she was 
doing. She was trying to unibuckle a 
seat belt that was deeply embedded 
in the distended flesh at the waist 
of one of the dead men. 

He conquered his revulsion, 
swallowed the nausea that was ris- 
ing in his throat. He pulled the 
sharp sheath knife from his belt, 
“This is quicker,” and slashed 
through the tough fabric of the 



strap. He was careful not to touch 
the gleaming, purple skin. He knew 
that if he did so the dead man would 
. burst. 

Carefully, Sonya lifted the body 
from its seat, sat it down on the 
deck so that the magnetized sandal 
shoes were in contact with the steel 
plating. Then she pointed to the 
back of the chair. “What dp you 
make of this?” she asked. • 

'"That was a vertioal slot, just 
over an inch in width, that was con- 
tinued into the seat itself, half bi- 
secting it. 

It was Pendeen who broke the 
silence. He said simply, “They had 
tails.” 

“But they haven’t,” objected 
Grimes. It was obvious that the 
minimal breech-clouts of the dead 
people could not conceal even a 
tiny caudal appendage. 

“My dear John,” Sonya told him 
in an annoyingly superior voice, 
“these hapless folk are neither the 
builders nor the original crew of 
this ship. Refugees? Could be. Es- 
capees? A slave revolt? Once again 
— could be. Or must ibe. This is 
a big ship and a fighting ship. You 
can’t run a vessel of this class with- 
out uniforms, without marks of 
rank so you can see at a glance who 
is suppcwed to be doing what. Fur- 
thermore, you don’t clutter up a 
man-o’^ar with children.” 

“She’s not necessarily a man-o’- 
war,” demurred Grimes. “She could 
be a defensively armed merchant- 
man.” 

“With officers and first class 
passengers dressed in foul rags? 
With a name like Destroyer?”

“We don’t know that that group- 
ing of letters on the stem does spell 
DESTROYER.” 

“We don’t know that this other 
grouping of letters — ” she point- 
ed to the control panel that Grimes 
had been studying — “spells 
MANNSCHENN DRIVE — RE- 
MOTE CONTROL. But I’m willing 
to bet my gravity that if you trace 
the leads you’ll wind up in a com- 
paitment full of dimension^twisting 
gyiosciopes.” 

“AH right,” said Grimes. “I’ll go 
along with you. I’H admit that we’re 
aboard a ship built by some hum- 
anoid but possibly nonhuman race 
that, even so, uses a peculiar dis- 
tortion of English as its written 
language.” 

“A humanoid race with tails,” 
contributed Pendeen. 

“A humanoid race with tails,” 
agreed Sonya. “But what race? Look 
at this slot in the chair back. It’s 
designed for somebody — or some- 
thing — with a thin tail, thin at the 
root as well as at the extremity. And 
the only tailed beinigs we know with 
any technology comparable to our 
own have thick tails — and, fur- 
thermore, have their own written 
languages. Just imagine one of our 
saurian friends trying to get out of 
that chair in a hurry — assuming 
that he’d ever been able to get into 
it in the first place. He’d be trap- 
ped.”. ' 

“You’re the Intelligence Officer,” 
Said Grimes rather nastily. 

4 4 A U right. I am. Also, I hold 
a doctorate in Xenology. 
And I tell you, John, that what 



we’ve found in this ship, so far, 
doesn’t add up to any kind of sense 
at all.” 

“She hasn’t made any sense ever 
since she was first picked up by 
Station 3,” admitted Grimes. 

“That she hasn’t,” said Pendeen. 
“And I don’t like her. Not one little 
bit.” 

“Why not, Mr. Pendeen?” asked 
Grimes, realizing that it was a 
foolish question to ask about a radio- 
active hull full of corpses. 

“Because . .* Because she’s 
wrong, sir. The proportions and sit- 
ing of all her controls and fittings 
— just wrong enough to be scary. 
And left-handed threads, and gaug- 
es calibrated from right to left.” 

“So they are,” said Grimes, “But 
that’s odder still. Why don’t they 
write the same way? From right to 
left.” 

“Perhaps they do,” murmured 
Sonya. “But I don’t think so. I 
think that the only difference be- 
tween our written language and theirs 
is that they have an allpurpose ‘I’, 
or an all-purpose symbol that’s 
used for every vowel sound.” She 
was prowling around the control 
room. “Damn it all, there must be 
a log book.” 

“There should be a log book,” 
amended Grimes. 

“All right. There should be a 
log book. Here’s an obvious log 
desk, complete with stylus, but emp- 
ty ... I begin to see how it must 
have been. The ship safe in port, all 
her papers landed for checking, and 
then her seizure by these people, by 
these unfortunate humans, who- 
ever they were .... H’m. The

IF 




chart tank might tell us something 
. She glared at the empty globe. 
“It would have told us something 
if it hadn’t been in close proximity 
to a nuclear blast. But there will be 
traces. Unfortunately we haven’t the 
facilities here to bring them out.” 
She resumed her purposeful shuffle. 
“And what have we here? SIGNIL 
LIG? SIGNAL LOG? A black box 
that might well contain quite a few 
answers when we hook it up to a 
power supply. And that, I think 
will lie within the capabilities of our 
Radio Officer back aboard Rim 
Mamelute” 

The thing was secured by sim- 
ple enough clips to the side of what 
was obviously a transceiver. Deft- 
ly, Sonya disengaged it, tucked it 
under her arm. 

“Back to the Mamelute** said 
Grimes. It was more an order than 
a suggestion. 

“Back to the Mamelute** she 
agreed. 

The Commodore was last from 
the control room, watched first Pen- 
deen and then Sonya vanish through 
the hatch into the axial shaft. He 
half wished that enough air re- 
mained in their suit tanks for them 
to make a leisurely examination of 
the accommodation that must be 
situated abaft Control — and was 
more than half relieved that circum- 
stances did not permit such a course 
of action. He had seen his fill of 
corpses. In any case, the signal log- 
might tell them far more than the 
inspection of decomposing corpses 
ever could. 

He felt easier in his mind when 
the three of them were standing, 



once more, in the plastic igloo that 
covered the breached airlock and 
almost happy when, one by one, 
they had squeezed through the built- 
in sphincter valve back to the clean 
emptiness of Space. The harsh work- 
ing lights of Rim Mamelute seemed 
soft somehow, mellow almost^ sug- 
gested the lights of Home. And the 
cramped interior of the tug, when 
they were back on board, was com- 
forting. 

If one has to be jostled, it is bet- 
ter to be jostled by the. living than 
by dead men and women, part- 
cremated in a steel coffin tumbling 
aimlessly between the stars. 

VIII 

I t was very quiet in the radio 
office of Rim Mamelute. Grimes 
and Sonya stood there, watching 
chubby little Bennett make the last 
connections to the black box that 
they had brought from the control 
room of the derelict. “Yes,” the 
Electronic Radio Officer had told 
them, “it is a signal log. And it’s 
well shielded, so whatever records 
it may contain probably haven’t 
been wiped by radiation. Once I get 
it hooked up we’ll have the play 
back.” 

And now it was hooked up. “Are 
you sure you won’t burn it out?” 
asked the Commodore, suddenly 
anxious. 

“Almost sure, sir,” answered 
Bennett cheerfully. “The thing’s 
practically an exact copy of the 
signal logs that were in use in some 
ships of the Federation Survey Ser- 
vice all of fifty years ago. Before

my time. Anyhow, my last em- 
ployment before I came out to the 
Rim was in the Lyran Navy, and 
their wagons were all Survey Ser- 
vice cast offs. In many of them the 
original communications gear was 
still in place and still in working 
order. No, sir, this isn’t the first 
time that I’ve made one of these 
babies sing. Reminds me of when 
we picked up the wreck of the old 
Minstrel Boy — I was Chief Sparks 
of the Tara* s Hall at the time — and 
got the gen from her signal log that 
put us on the trail of Black Bart 
. He added unnecessarily, “the 
pirate.” 

“I have heard of him,” said 
Grimes coldly. 

Sonya remarked, pointing towards 
the box, “But it doesn’t look old.” 

“No, Mrs. Grimes. It’s not old. 
Straight from the maker. I’d say. 
But there’s no maker’s name, which 
is odd.” 

“Switch on, Mr. Bennett,” or- 
dered the Commodore. 

Bennett switched on. The thing 
hummed quietly, crackled briefly 
and thinly as the spool rewound. It 
crackled again, more loudly, and 
the play back began. 

The voice that issued from the 
speaker spoke English — of a sort. 
But it was not human. It was a 
thin, high, alien squeaking. And yet, 
somehow, not alien enough. The 
consonants were ill-defined, and 
there was only one vowel sound. 

*'Eeveengeer tee Deestreeyeer, 
Eeveengeer tee Deestreeyeer. Heeve 
tee. Heeve tee!” 

The voice that answered was not 
a very convincing imitation of that 



strange accent. **Deestreeyer tee 
Eeveenger. Reepeet, pleese. Ree- 
peet.” 

“A woman,” whispered Sonya. 
“Human.” 

Heeve tee, Deestreeyeer, Heeve 
tee, eer wee eepeen feer!” 

A pause, then the woman’s voice 
again, the imitation even less con- 
vincing, a certain desperation all too 
evident: ^'Deestreeyeer tee Avenger. 
Deestreeyeer tee Eeveengeer . 
Eer Dreeve ceentreels e^ eet eef 
eerdeer . .” 

Playing for time', thought Grimes. 
while clumsy hands fumble with un- 
familiar armament. But they tried. 
They did their best . 

“Dee!” screamed the inhuman 
voice. “Heemeen sceem, dee!” 

“And that must have been it,” 
muttered Grimes. 

“It was,” said Sonya flatly, and 
the almost inaudible whirring of 
what remained on the spool bore 
her out. 

“That mistake she made,” said 
Grimes softly, “is the clue. For 
Eeveengeer, read Avenger. For 
every ‘E’ sound substitute the vowel 
that makes sense. But insofar as the 
written language is concerned, that 
fat ‘I’ is really an ‘E’.” 

‘That seems to be the way of 
it,” agreed Sonya. 

“ ‘Die* ”, repeated the Commo- 
dore slowly. “ ‘Human scum, die!* ” 
He said, “Whoever those people 
are, they wouldn’t be at all nice 
to know.” 

“That’s what I’m afraid of,” 
Sonya told him. ‘That we might 
get to know them. Whoever they are 
— and wherever, and whenever.”

T he derelict hung in orbit about 
Lorn, and the teams of scien- 
tists and technicians continued the 
investigations initiated by Rim 
Mamelute*s people during the long 
haul to the tug’s home planet. 
Grimes, Sonya and the others had 
been baffled by what they had 
found — and now, with reluctance, 
the experts were admitting their own 
bafflement. 

This ship — named Destroyer by 
her builders, and renamed Freedom 
by those who had not lived long 
to enjoy it — seemed to have just 
completed a major refit and to have 
been in readiness for her formal 
recommissioning. Although her mag- 
azines and some of her storerooms 
were stocked, although her hydro- 
ponics tanks and tissue culture vats 
had been operational at the time of 
her final action, her accommodation 
and working spaces were clean of 
the accumulation of odds and ends 
that, over the years, adds appre- 
ciably to the mass of any vessel. 
TTiere were no files of official cor- 
respondence, although there was not 
a shortage of empty filing cabinets. 
There were no revealing personal 
possessions such as letters, photo- 
graphs and solidographs, books, re- 
cordings, magazines and pin-^up girl 
calendars. (The hapless humans 
who had been killed by the blast 
seemed to have brought aboard only 
the rags that they were wearing.) 
There were no log books in either 
control or engine rooms. 

The cabins were furnished, how- 
ever, and in all of them were the 



strange chairs with the slotted backs 
and seats, the furniture that was 
evidence of the existence of a race 
— an unknown race, insisted the 
xenologists — of tailed beings, ap- 
proximating the human norm in sta- 
ture. Every door tally was in place. 
And each one made it clear that 
the creatures who had manned the 
ship, before her seizure, . used the 
English language, but a version of 
it peculiarly their own. KIPTIN . 
CHIIF INGINIIR . RIICTIIN 
DRIVI RUM . HIDRIPINICS 
RUM . 

Even so she was, apart from the 
furniture and the distortions of 
printed English and — as the engineers 
pointed out — the prevalence of 
left-handed threads, a very ordinary 
ship, albeit somewhat old-fashioned. 
There was, for example, no Carlotti 
navigational and communications 
equipment. And the signal log was a 
model the use of which had been 
discontinued by the Survey Service 
for all of half a standard century. 
And she lacked yet another device 
of fairly recent origin — the Mass 
Proximity Indicator. 

She was, from the engineering 
viewpoint, a very ordinary ship; it 
was the biologists who discovered a 
shocking abnormality. 

They did not discover it at once. 
They concentrated, at first, upon 
the cadavers of the unfortunate 
humans. These were, it was soon 
announced, indubitably human. 
They had been born upon and had 
lived their lives upon an Earth-type 
planet — but their lives had not 
been pleasant ones. Their physiques 
exhibited all the signs of under- 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



29 




nourishment, of privation, and they 
almost all hore scars that told an 
ugly story of habitual maltreatment. 
But they were men, and they were 
women, and had they lived and had 
enjoyed for a year or so normal 
living conditions they would have 
been indistinguishable from the 
citizens of any Man-colonized world. 

And there was nothing abnormal 
in the hydroponics tanks. There were 
just the standard plants that are 
nutured in ships’ farms throughout 
the galaxy — tomatoes and cucum- 
bers, potatoes and carrots, the Cen- 
taurian umbrella vine, Vegan moss- 
fern. 

It was the tissue culture vats that 
held the shocking secret. 

The flesh that they contained, the 
meat that was the protein supply 
for the tailed beings who should 
have manned the ship, was human 
flesh. 

CCT was right,” said Sonya to 

X Grimes. “I was right. Those 
people — whoever, wherever (and 
whenever?) they are — are our 
enemies. But where are they? And 
when?** 

"From . from outside?” won- 
dered the Commodore. 

"Don’t be a bloody fool, John. 
Do you think that a race could wan- 
der in from the next galaxy but 
three, reduce a whole planet of 
humans to slavery, and worse than 
slav^, without our knowing about 
it? And why sihould such a race, if 
there were one, have to borrow — 
or steal — our shipbuilding tech- 
niques, our language, even? Damn 
it all, it doesn’t make sense. It 



doesn’t even begin to make sense.” 
"That’s what weVe all been say- 
ing ever since this blasted derelict 
first appeared.” 

"And it’s true.” She got up from 
her chair and began to pace up 
and down Grimes’s office. "Mean- 
while, my dear, we’ve been left hold- 
ing the baby. You’ve been asked to 
stay on in your various capacities 
until the mystery has been solved, 
and my resignation from the Intelli- 
gence Branch of the Survey Service 
has been rescinded. I’ve been em- 
powered by the Federation Govern- 
ment to co-oprt such Confederacy 
personnel to assist me in my in- 
vestigations as I see fit. (That means 
you — for a start.) Forgive me for 
thinking out loud. It helps some- 
times. Why don’t you try it?” 

"All we know** said Grimes 
slowly, "is that we’ve been left hold- 
ing the baby.” 

"All we know,” she countered, 
"is that we’re suppose to carry the 
can back.” 

"But why shouldn’t we?” he de- 
manded suddenly. "Not necessarily 
this can, but one of our own.” 

She stopped her restless motion, 
turned to stare at him. She said 
coldly, "I thought that you had 
made a study of archaic slang ex- 
pressions. Apparently I was wrong.” 
"Not at all, Sonya, I know what 
‘to carry the can back’ means. I 
I know, too, that the word ‘can’ is 
still used to refer to more and big- 
ger things than containers of beer 
or preserved foods. Such as — ” 
"Such as ships,” she admitted. 
"Such as ships. All right. How 
do we carry the can — or a can — 



30 



IF 




back? Back to where the can came 
from?” 

“But where? Or when?** 

“That’s what we have to find 
out.” 

She said, “I think it will have to 
be the can. That is if you’re think- 
ing what I think you’re thinking — 
that this Destroyer or Freedom or 
whatever you care to call her drift- 
ed in from one' of the alternative 
universes. She’ll have that built-in 
urge. Yes, urge. She’ll have that 
built-in urge to return to her own 
continuum.” 

“So you accept the alternative 
universe theory?” 

“It seems to fit the facts. After 
all, out here on the Rim, the transi- 
tion from one universe to another has 
been made more than once.” 

“As we should know.” 

“If only we knew how the dere- 
lict did drift in — ” 

“Did she drift in?” asked Grimes 
softly. And then, in spoken answer 
to his wife’s unspoken query, “I 
think she was blown in.” 

“Yes . Yes. Could be. A nu- 
clear explosion in close, very close 
proximity to the ship. The very fab- 
ric of the continuum, strained and 
warped.” She smiled, but it was a 
grim smile. “That could be it.” 
“And that' could be the way to 
carry the can back.” 

“I don’t want to be fried, my 
dear. And, oddly enough. I shouldn’t 
like to see you fried.” 

There’s no need for anybody to 
be fried. Have you never heard of 
lead shielding?” 

“Of course. But the weight! Even 
if we shielded only a small com- 



partment the reaction drive’d be 
working flat out to get us off the 
ground, and we’d have damn all 
reaction mass to spare for any ma- 
neuvers. And the rest of the ship, 
as we found when we boarded the 
derelict, would be so hot as to be 
uninhabitable for months.” 

He gestured towards the wide 
window, to the squat tower that was 
Faraway Quest. “I seem to remem- 
ber, Sonya, that you shipped with 
me on our wild ghost chase. Even 
though you were aboard as an offi- 
cer of the Federation’s Naval In- 
telligence you should remember 
how the Quest was fitted. Anti-mat- 
ter gave us anti-gravity. We can in- 
corporate it into Freedom*s struc- 
ture as it was incorporated into the 
Quest's. With it functioning, we can 
afford to shield the entire ship and 
still enjoy almost negative mass.” 

“So you think we should take 
Freedom, or Destroyer, and not Far- 
away Quest?** 

“I do. Assuming that we’re able 
to blow her back into the continuum 
she came from, she’ll be a more 
convincing Trojan Horse than one 
of our own ships.” 

“Cans,” she said. “Trojan horses. 
Can you think of any more meta- 
phors?” She smiled again, and her 
expression was not quite so grim. 
“But I see what you mean. Our 
friends with the squeaky voices and 
the long, thin tails will think that 
their own lost ship has somehow 
wandered back to them, still man- 
ned by the escaped slaves.” Her face 
hardened. “I almost feel sorry for 
them.” 

“Almost,” he agreed.

T he boffins were reluctant to re- 
lease Freedom, but Grimes was 
insistent, explaining that disguise of 
Faraway Quest, no matter how good, 
might well be not good enough. A 
small, inconspicuous but betraying 
feature of her outward appearance 
could lead to her immediate destruc- 
tion. “Then what about the crew, 
Commodore?” asked one of the 
scientists. “Surely those tailed be- 
ings will soon realize that the ship 
is not manned by the original reb- 
els.” 

“Not necessarily,” Grimes told 
the man. “In fact, I think it’s quite 
unlikely. Even among human be- 
ings all members of a different race 
tend to look alike. And when it 
comes to members of two entirely 
different species — ” 

“I’m reasonably expert,” added 
Sonya, “but even I find it hard un- 
til I’ve had -time to observe care- 
fully the beings with whom I’m 
dealing.” 

“But there’s so much that we 
could learn from the ship!” pro- 
tested the scientist. 

“Mr. Wales,” Grimes said to the 
Rim Runners’ Superintending En- 
gineer, “How much do you think 
there is to be learned from the dere- 
lict?” 

“Not a damn thing. Commodore. 
But if we disguise one of our own 
ships^ and succeed in blowing her 
into wihatever comic alternative 
universe she came from, there’s far 
too much that could be learned 
from us. In shipbuilding we’re prac- 
tically a century ahead.” 



“Good enough. Well, gentlemen?” 
“I suggest, Commodore, that we 
bring your Freedom's armament up 
to scratch,” said Admiral Hennes- 
sey — but the way that he said 
it made it more of an order than 
a suggestion. 

Grimes turned to face the Ad- 
miral, the flag officer commanding 
the naval forces of the Confederacy. 
Bleak stare clashed with bleak stare, 
almost audibly. As -an officer of the 
reserve Grimes consider^ himself a 
better spaceman than his superior 
and was inclined to resent the in- 
trusion of the Regular Navy into 
what he was already regarding as 
his own show. 

He replied firmly, “No, sir. That 
could well give the game away.” 
He was hurt when Sonya took 
the Admiral’s side — but, after all, 
she was regular Navy herself, al- 
though Federation and not Confed- 
eracy. She said, “But what about 
the lead sheathing, John? What 
about the sphere of anti-matter?” 
Grimes was not beaten. “Mr. 
Wales has already made a valid 
point. He thinks that it would be 
imprudent to make the aliens a 
present of a century’s progress in 
astronautical engineering. It would 
be equally imprudent to make them 
a present of a century’s progress in 
weapKxnry.” 

“You have a point there. Grimes,” 
admitted the Admiral. “But I do 
not feel happy about allowing my 
personnel in a vessel on a hazar- 
dous mission without the utmost 
protection that I can afford them.” 
“Apart from the Marines, sir, 
my personnel rather than yours. 



32 



IF 




Practically every officer will be a 
reservist.” 

The Admiral glared at the Com- 
modore. He growled, “Franldy, if 
it were not for the pressure brought 
to bear by our Big Brothers of the 
Federation, I should insist on com- 
missioning a battle squadron.” He 
smiled coldly in Sonya’s direction. 
“But the Terran Admiralty seems 
to trust Commander Verrill — or 
Mrs. Grimes — and has given her 
on-the-spot powers that would be 
more fitting to a holder of flag 
officer’s rank. And my own in- 
structions from Government House 
are to afford her every assistance.” 
He made a ritual of selecting a long, 
black cigar from the case that he 
took from an inside pocket of his 
uniform, lit it, filled the already 
foul air of the derelict’s control 
room with wreathing eddies of acrid 
blue smoke. He said in a voice that 
equalled in acridity the fumes that 
carried it, “Very well. Commodore. 
You’re having your own way. Or 
your wife is having her own way; 
she has persuaded the Federation 
that you are to be in full com- 
mand. (But will you be, I wonder?) 
May I, as your Admiral, presume to 
inquire just what are your inten- 
tions, assuming that the nuclear de- 
vice that you 'have commandeered 
from my arsenal does blow you into 
the right continuum?” 

“We shall play by ear, sir.” 

r ie Admiral seemed to be emu- 
lating the weapon that he had 
just mentioned, but he did not quite 
reach critical mass. “Play by ear!” 
he bellowed at last, when coherent 



speech was at last possible. “Play 
by ear! Damn it all, sir, that’s the 
sort of fatuous remark one might 
expect from a snotty making his 
first training cruise, but not from 
an allegedly responsible officer.” 

“Admiral Hennessey!” Sonya’s 
voice was as cold as his had been. 
“This is not a punitive expedition. 
This is not a well organized attack 
by naval forces. This is an Intelli- 
gence operation. We do not know 
what we are up against. We are 
trying to find out.” Her voice soft- 
ened slightly. “I admit that the Com- 
modore expressed himself in a 
rather unspacemanlike manner — 
but playing by ear is what we shall 
do. How shall I put it? We shall poke 
a stick into the ants’ nest and see 
what comes out.” 

“We shall hoist the banner of the 
Confederacy to the masthead and 
see who salutes,” somebody said in 
one of those carrying whispers. The 
Admiral, the Commodore and Son- 
ya Verrill turned to glare at the 
man. Then Sonya laughed. “That’s 
one way of putting it. Only it won’t 
be the black and gold of the Con- 
federacy — it’ll be the black and 
silver of the Jolly Roger. A little 
judicious piracy — or privateering. 
Will Rim Worlds Letter of Marque 
be valid wherever we’re going. Ad- 
miral?” 

That officer managed a rather 
sour chuckle. “I think I get the 
drift of your intentions. Commander. 
I hate to have to admit it — but I 
wish that I were coming with you.” 
He transferred his attention to 
Grimes. “So, Commodore, I think 
that I shall be justified in at least 



EDGE OF NIGHT

repairing or renewing the weapons 
that were damaged or destroyed by 
the blast — as long as I don’t fit 
anything beyond the technology of 
the builders of this ship.” 

“Please do that, sir.” 

“I shall. But what about small 
arms for your officers and the 
Marines?” 

Grimes pondered the question. 
There had 'been no pistols of any 
kind aboard the derelict when he 
had boarded her. It could be argued 
that this was a detail that did not 
much matter. Should the ship be 
boarded and seized herself, there 
would be both the lead sheathing 
and the sphere of anti-matter that 
would make it obvious to the board- 
ing party that she had been . 
elsewhere. Assuming, that is, that 
the last survivors of her crew did 
not trigger the explosive charge that 
would shatter the neutronium shell 
and destroy the magnets, thus bring- 
ing the sphere of anti-iron into con- 
tact with the normal matter sur- 
rounding it. Then there would be 
nobody to talk about what had been 
found. 

But Freedom — as a pirate or a 
privateer — would be sending 
boarding parties to other ships. 
There was the possibility that she 
might have to run before superior 
forces, unexpectedly appvearing, 
leaving such a 'boarding party to its 
fate. Grimes most sincerely hoped 
that he would never have to make 
such a decision. And if the board- 
ing party possessed obviously alien 
hand weapons the tailed beings 
would be, putting it very mildly, 
suspicious. 



“No hand weapons,” he said at 
last, reluctantly. “But I hope that 
we shall be able to capture a few 
and that we shall be able to dupli- 
cate them in the ship’s workshop. 
Meanwhile, I’d like your Marines to 
be experts in unarmed combat — 
both suited and unsuited.” 

“And expert knife fighters,” add- 
ed Sonya. 

“Boarding axes and cutlasses,” 
contributed the Admiral, not with- 
out relish. 

“Yes, sir,” agreed Grimes. 
“Boarding axes and cutlasses.” 

“I suggest. Commodore,” said 
Hennessey, “that you do a course 
at the Personal Combat Center at 
Lorn Base.” 

“I don’t think that there will be 
time, sir,” said Grimes hopefully. 

“There will be. Commodore. The 
lead sheathing and the anti-matter 
sphere cannot be installed in five 
minutes. And there are the weapons 
to be repaired and renewed.” 

“There will be time,” said Sonya. 

Grimes sighed. He had been in 
one or two minor actions in his 
youth, but they had been so . 
impersonal. It was the enemy ship 
that you were out to get — and the 
fact that a large proportion of her 
crew was liable to die with her was 
something that you glossed over. 
You did not see the dreadful dam- 
age that your missiles and beams 
did to the fragile flesh and blood 
mechanisms that were human be- 
ings. Or if you did see it, a hard 
frozen corpse is not the same as 
one still warm, still pumping blood 
from severed arteries, still twitching 
in a ghastly semblance to life. 



34 



IF 




“There will be time, Cammo- 
dore,” repeated the Admiral. 

“There will be time,” repeated 
Sonya. 

“And what about you, Mrs. 
Grimes?” asked Hennessey unkind- 

ly- 

“You forget, sir, that in my 
branch of the Federation’s service 
we are taught how to kill or maim 
with whatever is at hand any and 
every life form with which we may 
come into contact.” 

“Then I will arrange for the Com- 
modore’s course,” Hennessey told 
her. 

I t was, for Grimes, a gruelling 
three weeks. He was fit enough, 
but he was not as hard as he might 
have been. 

Even wearing protective armor 
he emerged from every bout with 
the sergeant instructor badly bruised 
and battered. And he did not like 
knives, although he attained fair skill 
with them as a throwing weapon. 
He disliked cutlasses even more. 
And the boarding axes, with their 
pike heads, he detested. 

And then, quite suddenly, it came 
to him. The instructor had given 
him a bad time, as usual, and had 
then called a break. Grimes stood 
there, sagging in his armor, using 
the shaft of his axe as a staff upon 
which to lean. He was aching, and 
he was itching inside his protective 
clothing, and his copious perspira- 
tion was making every abrasion on 
his skin smart painfully. 

Without warning the instructor 
kicked Grimes support away with 
a booted foot and then, as the Com- 



modore sprawled on the hard- 
ground, raised his own axe for the 
simulated kill. 

Although a red haze clouded his 
vision Grimes rolled out of the path 
of the descending blade, heard the 
blunted edge thud into the dirt a 
fraction of an inch from his helmet- 
ed head. He was on his feet then, 
moving with an agility that he had 
never dreamed that he pK>ssessed, 
crouching, and hfe spiked head 
thrusting viciously at the instruc- 
tor’s crotch. The man squealed as 
the blow connected; even the heavy 
cod piece could not save him from 
severe pain. He squealed, but 
brought his own axe round in a 
sweeping, deadly arc. Grimes par- 
ried, blade edge to shaft, to such 
a good effect that the lethal head of 
the other’s weapon was broken off, 
clattering to the ground many feet 
away. He parried and followed 
through, his blade clanging on the 
instructor’s shoulder armor. Yet an- 
other blow, this time to the man’s 
broad back, and he was down like 
a felled ox. 

Slowly the red haze cleared from 
the Commodore’s vision as he stood 
there. Slowly he lowered his axe, 
and as he did so he realized that 
the instructor had rolled over, was 
lying there laughing up at him, was 
saying, “Easy, sir. Easy. You’re not 
supposed to kill me, sir. Or to ruin 
my matrimonial prospects.” , 

“I’m sorry. Sergeant,” Grimes 
said stiffly. “But that was a dirty 
trick you played.” 

“It was meant to be dirty, sir. 
Never trust nobody. That’s Lesson 
One.” 



EDGE OF NIGHT

“And Lesson Two, Sergeant?” 

“You’ve learned that too, sir. You 
gotta hate. You oMceiis are ail the 
same — you don’t really hate the 
poor cows at the other end of the 
trajectory when you press a firing 
button. But in this sort of fighting 
you gotta hate.” 

“I thinik I see, Sergeant,” said 
Grimes. 

But he was not sorry when he was 
able to return to his real business — 
to see Freedom (or Destroyer) 
readied for her expedition into the 
Unknown. 

XI 

reedom was commissioned as a 
cruiser of the Navy of the Rim 
Worlds Confederacy — but the 
winged wheel of the Rim Worlds 
had not replaced the emibossed let- 
tering of her oriiginal name or the 
crude, black-painted characters that 
had partially obscured it. Freedom 
was mann^ by spacemen and 
spacewoman of the Reserve and a 
company of Marines. But there was 
no display of gold braid and brass 
buttons. Marks of rank and depart- 
mental insignia had been daubed on 
the bare skin or wrists and upper 
arms and shoulders in an indelible 
vegetable dye. Apart from this 
crude attempt at uniform, the ship’s 
complement was attired in scanty, 
none too* clean rags. The men were 
shaggily bearded; the roughly hack- 
ed hair of the women was unkempt. 
All of them bore unsightly cicatrices 
on their bodies — but these were 
the result of plastic surgery, not of 
ill-treatment. 



Outwardly, Freedom was just as 
she had b^n when she suddenly 
materialized in her suicidal orbit off 
Lorn. Internally, however, there 
had been changes made. On the 
side that had been seared by the 
blast, the weapons — the laser pro- 
jectors and the missile launchers — 
had been repaired, although this 
had been done so as not to be ap- 
parent to an external observer. In 
a hitherto empty storeroom just 
forward of the enginerooms, the 
sphere of anti-matter ^ had been in- 
stalled — the big ball of anti4ron 
and the powerful magnets that held 
it in place inside its neutronium cas- 
ing. And within the shell plating was 
the thick lead sheathing that would 
protect the ship’s personnel from 
lethal radiation when the nuclear 
device was exploded that. Grimes 
hoped, would blow the vessel back 
to where she had come from. (The 
physicists had assured him that the 
od^ on this happening were seven- 
to-five, and that the odds on the 
ship’s finding herself in a habitable 
univeirse seemed to be almost astro- 
nomical.) 

There was one more change in- 
sofar as the internal fittings were 
concerned, and it was a very im- 
portant one. The tissue culture vats 
now contained pork and not human 
flesh. “After all,” Grimes had said 
to a biologist who was insisting 
upon absolute verisimilitude, “there’s 
not all that much difference be- 
tween pig and long pig.” 

The man had gone all technical 
on him, and the Commodore had 
snapped, “Pirate we may have to 
become, but not cannibds!” 




36 



IF 




B ut even pirates^ thought Grimes, 
surveying the officers in his 
control room, would be dressier than 
this mob. 

He was glad that he had in- 
sisted upon the painted badges of 
rank — the beards made his male 
officers hard to recognize. With the 
female ones it was not so bad, al- 
though other features (like the men, 
the women wore only breech clouts) 
tended to distract attention from 
their faces. Clothes certainly make 
the man, the Commodore admitted 
wryly to himself. And the woman — 
although this very undress uniform 
suits Sonya well enough, even 
though her hairdo does look as 
though she*s been dragged through 
a hedge backwards. It felt all wrong 
for him to be sitting in the chair of 
command, the seat of the mighty, 
without the broad gold stripes on 
his epaulettes (and without the 
epaulettes themselves, and without 
a shirt to mount them on) and with- 
out the golden comets encrusting 
the peak of his cap. But the ragged, 
indigo band encircling each hairy 
wrist would have to do, just as the 
coarse, burlap kilt would have to 
substitute for the tailored, sharply 
creased shorts that were his nor- 
mal shipboard wear. 

He was concerning himself with 
trivialities, he knew. But it is some- 
times helpful and healthy to let the 
mind be lured away, however brief- 
ly, from consideration of the greater 
issues. 

Williams — lately Mr. Williams, 
Mate of Rim Mamelute, now Com- 
mander Williams, Executive Officer 
of Freedom — had the con. Under 



his control the ship was riding the 
beam from Lorn back to the posi- 
tion in which she had first been 
picked up by Orbital Station 3. It 
was there, the scientists had as- 
sured Grimes, that she would stand 
the ibest Chance of being blown into 
her own continuum. The theory 
seemed to make sense, although the 
mathematics of it were far beyond 
the Commodore, expert navigator 
though he was. 

The ship was falling free now, 
her reaction drive silent, dropping 
down the long empty miles towards 
a rendezvous that would be no more 
(at first) than a flickering of 
needles on dials, an undulation of 
the glowing traces on the faces of 
monitor tubes. Through the still un- 
shuttered ports there was nothing 
to be seen ahead but the dim, ruddy 
spark that was the Bblis sun> and 
nothing to port but a faint, far 
nebulosity that was one of the dis- 
tant island universes. To starboard 
was the mistily gleaming galactic 
lens, a great ellipse of luminosity in 
which there were specks of brighter 
ligjit, like jewels in the hair of some 
dark goddess. Grimes smiled wryly 
at his poetic fancies — and Sonya,' 
who had guessed what he had been 
thinking, grinned at him cheerfully. 
She was about to speak when Wil- 
liam’s voice broke the silence. 
“Hear this! Hear this! Stand by for 
deceleration. Stand by for de- 
celeration!” 

Retro-rockets coughed, then 
shrieked briefly. For a second or 
so seat belts became almost in- 
tolerable 'bonds. The Executive Of- 
ficer emitted a satisfied grunt, then 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



37 




said, “Spot on, Skipper. Secure for 
the big bang?” 

“You know the drill. Comman- 
der Williams. Carry on, please.” 

“Good-oh, Skipper.” Williams 
snapped orders, and the ship shivered 
a little as the capsule contiaining the 
nuclear device was launched. 

Grimes saw the thing briefly 
from a port before the shutters of 
armor plating and thick lead sheath- 
ing slid into place. It was just a 
dull-gleaming metal cylinder. It 
should have looked innocuous — 
but somehow it didn’t. Grimes was 
suddenly acutely conscious of the 
craziness of this venture. The scien- 
tists had been sure that everything 
would work as it should — but they 
were not here to see their theories 
put to the test. But I must be fair. 
Grimes told himself. After all, it 
was our idea. Mine and Sonya*s . 

“Fire!” he heard Williams say. 

But nothing happened. 

'T'^ere was no noise — but, of 
course, in the vacuum of deep 
space there should not have been. 
There was no sense of shook. There 
was no appreciable rise of the con- 
trol room temperature. 

“A misfire?” somebody audibly 
wondered. 

“Try to raise Lorn,” Grimes or- 
dered the Radio Officer. “Orbital 
Station 3 is maintaining a listening 
watch on our frequency.” 

TTiere was a period of silence, 
broken only by .the hiss and crackle 
of interstellar static, then the voice of 
the operator saying quietly, **Free- 
dom to Station Three. Fr^om to 
Station Three. Do you hear me? 



Again there was silence. 

“Sample the bands,” said Grimes. 
“Listening watch only.” 

And then they knew that the 
bomb had exploded, that the re- 
sults of the explosion had been as 
planned. 

There was an overheard dialogue 
between two beings with high, 
squeaky voices, similar to the voice 
that had been recorded in Freedom's 
signal log. There was a discussion 
of estimated time of arrival and of 
arrangements for the discharge of 
cargo — hard to understand at first, 
but easier once ear and brain be- 
came attuned to the distortion of 
vowel soimds. 

When the ports were unscreened, 
the outside view was as it had been 
prior to the launching of the bomb 
— 'but Grimes and his people knew 
that the worlds in oibit around those 
dim, far suns were not, in this Uni- 
verse, under human dominion. 

XII 

CiXT^hat’s their radar like?” 
VV asked Grimes. 

“Judging by what’s in this ship, 
not too good,” replied Wiliams. 
“Their planet and station-based in- 
stallations will have a longer range, 
but unless they’re keeping a special 
look out they’ll not pick us up at 
this distance.” 

“Good,” said Grimes. “Then 
swing her. Commander. Put the 
Lorn sun dead ahead. Then calcu- 
late what deflection we shall need 
to make Lorn itself our planetfall.” 

“Reaction Drive, sir?” 

“No. Mannscheen Drive.”

“But we’ve no Mass Proximity 
Indicator, Skipper. And a jump of 
light-minutes only — ” 

“We’ve slipstioks and a perfect- 
ly good computer. With any luck we 
shall be able to intercept that ship 
coming in for a landing.” 

“You aren’t wasting any time, 
John,” said Sonya, approval in her 
voice. The Commodore could see 
that she was alone in her senti- 
ments. The other officers, includ- 
ing the Major of Marines, were 
staring at him as though doubtful 
of his sanity. 

“Get on with it. Commander,” 
snapped Grimes. “Our only hope of 
intercepting that ship is to m^e a 
fast approach and one that cannot 
be detected. And make it Action 
Stations while you’re about it.” 

“And Boarding Stations?” asked 
the major. The spacegoing soldier 
had recovered his poise, was re- 
garding his superior with respect. 

“Yes. Board Stations. Get your- 
self and your men into those adapt- 
ed spacesuits.” He added, with a 
touch of humor, “And don’t trip 
over your tads.” 

He sat well back in his chair as 
the gyroscopes whined, as the ship’s 
transparent nose with its cobweb 
of graticules swung slowly across 
the almbst empty sky. And then the 
yellow Lorn sun was ahead and 
Sonya, who had taken over the com- 
puter, was saying, “Allowing a time 
lag of exactly one hundred and 
twenty seconds from . now, give 
her five seconds of arc left de- 
flection.” 

“Preliminary thrust?” asked Wil- 
liams. 



“Seventy-five pounds, for exactly 
0.5 second.” 

“Mannschenn Drive ready,” re- 
ported the officer at the remote 
control. 

Grimes was glad that he had or- 
dered the time-warping device to 
be warmed up before the transition 
from one universe to the other had 
been made. He had foreseen the 
possibility of flight; he had not con- 
templated the possibility of initiat- 
ing a fight. But, as he had told the 
Admiral, he was playing by ear. He 
said to Sonya, “You have the con. 
Commander Verrill. Execute when 
ready.” 

“Ay, ay, sir. Stand by all. Com- 
mander Williams — preliminary 
thrust on the word ‘Fire!’ Mr. Cav- 
endish, Mannschenn Drive setting 
2.756. Operate for exactly 7.5 sec- 
onds immediately reaction drive has 
been cut. Stand by all. Ten . 
Nine . Eight . Seven ... Six 
. Five . .” 

Like one of the ancient submar- 
ines, Grimes was thinking. An in- 
visible approach to the target, and 
not even a periscope to betray us. 
But did those archaic warships ever 
make an approach on Dead Rec- 
koning? I suppose that they must 
have done — but only in their in- 
fancy. 

“Four . Three . Two . 
One . Fire!'* 

''Xihe rockets coughed briefly, dif- 
X fidently, and the normally 
heavy hand of acceleration deliver- 
ed no more than a gentle pat. Im- 
mediately there was the sensation 
of both temporal and spatial dis- 



BDGE OF NIGHT

orientation as the ever^recessing 
gyroscopes of the Drive began to 
spin — a sensation that faded al- 
most at once. And then the con- 
trol room was flooded with yellow 
light that dimmed as the ports were 
polarized. But there was still light 
— a pearly radiance of reflected 
illumination from the eternal, fami- 
liar overcast of Lorn. That planet 
hung on their port beam, a great, 
featureless sphere, looking the same 
as it had always looked to the men 
and women at the controls of the 
ship. 

But it was not the same. 

There was that excited voice, that 
shriU voice spilling from the speak- 
er. “Whee eere yee? Wheet sheep? 
Wheet sheep? Wee sheell reepeert 
yee. Yee knee theer eet ees feer- 
beedeen tee eese thee Dreeve weeth- 
een three reedeei!” 

“Almost rammed the jerks,” 
commented Williams. “That was 
close. Skip.” 

“It was,” agreed Grimes, look- 
ing at the radar repeater before his 
chair. “Match trajectory. Com- 
mander.” He could see the other 
ship through the ports now. Like 
Freedom, she was in orbit about 
Lorn. The reflected sunlight from 
her metal skin was dazzling, and 
he could not make out her name 
or any other details. But Sonya had 
put on a p^r of polaroids with tele- 
scopic lenses. She reported, “Her 
name’s Weejee. Seems to be just 
a merchantman. No armament that 
I can see.” 

“Mr. Carter!” 

“Sir!” snapped the Gunnery Offi- 
cer. 



“See if your laser can slice off 
our friend’s main venturi. And then 
the auxiliary ones.” 

“Ay, ay, sir.” 

The invisible beams stabbed out 
from Freedom* s projectors. In spite 
of the dazzle of reflected sunlight 
from the other’s hull, the blue in- 
candescence of melting, vaporizing 
metal was visible. And then Grimes 
was talking into the microphone 
that somebody had passed to him, 
**Freedom to Weejee. Freedom to 
Weejee. We are about to board 
you. Offer no resistance, and you 
will not be harmed.” 

And the shrill voice, hysterical 
now, was screaming to somebody far 
below on the planet’s surface. 
“Heelp! Heelp! Eeet ees thee Dees- 
treeyeer; Eeet ees thee sleeves! 
Heelp!” 

“Jam their signals!” ordered 
Grimes. How long would it be be- 
fore a warship came in answer to 
the distress call? Perhaps there was 
already one in orbit, hidden by the 
bulk of the planet. And there would 
be ground to space missiles certain- 
ly — but Carter could take care 
of them with his laser. 

Somebody came into the con- 
trol room, a figure in bulky space 
armor, a suit that had been de- 
signed to accommodate a long, pre- 
hensile tail. For a moment Grimes 
thought that it was one of the right- 
ful owners of the ship, that some- 
how a boarding had been effected. 
And then the Major’s voice distort- 
ed by the diaphragm in the snouted 
helmet, broke the spell. “Commo- 
dore Grimes, sir,” he said formal- 
ly, “my men are ready.”

IF 




Grimes told him, “I don’t think 
our friends out there are going to 
open up.” He added regretifully, 
“And we have no laser pistols.” 
“There are cutting and hurning 
tools in the engineers’ workshop, sir. 
I have already issued them to my 
men.” 

“Very good, Major. You may 
board.” 

“Your instructions, sir?” 

“Limit, your objectives. I’d like 
the log books from her Control 
and any other papers, such as man- 
ifests, that could be useful. But if 
there’s too much resistance, don’t 
bother. We may have to get out of 
here in a hurr>^ But I shall want 
at least one prisoner.” 

“We shall do our best, sir.” 

“I know you will, Major. But as 
soon as I sound the Recall — come 
a-running.” 

“Very good, sir.” The Marine 
managed a smart salute even in the 
disguising armor as he left the con- 
trol room. 

“Engaging ground to space mis- 
siles,” announced the Gunnery Of- 
ficer in a matter-of-fact voice. 
Looking out through the planet- 
ward ports, Grimes coidd see tiny, 
distant, intensely brilliant sparks 
against the cloud blanket. There 
was nothing to worry about — yet. 
Carter was picking off the rockets 
as soon as they came within range 
of his weapons. 

A nd then he saw the Marines jet- 
ting between the two sihips, 
each man with a vapor trail that 
copied and then surpassed the cau- 
dal appendage of his suit. They car- 



ried boarding axes, and the men 
in the lead were burdened with bulky 
cutting tools. He watched them 
come to what must have been a 
clangorous landing on the other 
vessel’s shell plating and then, with 
an ease that was the result of many 
drills, disperse themselves to give the 
tooLbearers room to work. Metal 
molted, flared and exploded " into 
glowing vapor. The ragged-edged 
disk that had been the outer valve of 
the airlock was pried up and clear 
and sent spinning away into empti- 
ness. There was a slight delay as 
the inner door was attacked — and 
then the armored figures were van- 
ishing rapidly into the holed ship. 

From the speaker of the trans- 
ceiver that was tuned to spacesuit 
frequency. Grimes heard the Major’s 
voice, “Damn it all, Bronsky, that’s 
a tool, not a weapon! Don’t waste 
the charge!” 

“He’d have got you, sir.” 
“Never mind that. I want that 
airtight door down!” 

And there were other sounds — 
clanging noises, panting, a confus- 
ed scuffling. There was a scream, 
a human scream. 

In the control room the radar of- 
ficer reported, “Twelve o’clock low. 
Two thousand miles. Reciproc^ tra- 
jectory. Two missiles launched.” 
“Carter!” said Grimes. 

“In hand, sir,” replied that of- 
ficer cheerfully. “So far.” 

“Recall the Marines,” ordered 
Grimes. “Secure control room for 
action.” 

The armored shutters slid over 
the ports. Grimes wondered how 
much protection the lead sheathing

caught ibetiween the two ships, their 
fate would be certain, unpleasantly 
so. And it was on the planetary side | 
of the ship, the side from which 
the boarding party would return, 
that the exterior television scanner 
had been destroyed by the blast that 
had thrown the ship into Grimes’s 
universe. That scanner had not been 
renewed. The Commodore could not 
tell whether or not the Major had 
obeyed bis order; by the time that 
the Marines were out of the radar’s 
blind spot they would almost be in 
Freedom's aModk. 

Not that the ladar was of much 
value now, at short range; Freedom 
was enveloped in a dense cloud of 
metallic motes. This would shield 
her from the enemy’s laser, although 






not from missiles. And the floating 
screens would render her own anti- 
missile laser ineffective. Missile- 
against-missile was aU very well — 
but the other warship was operat- 
ing from a base from which she 
could replenish her magazines. 

“RepK>rting on board, sir.” It was 
the Major’s voice, coming from the 
intercom speaker. “With casualties 
— none serious — and prisoner.” 

Wasting no time. Grimes sized 
up the navigational situation. The 
ship would be on a safe trajectory 
if the reaction drive were brought 
into operation at once. He so or- 
dered and then, after a short blast 
from the rockets, switched to Mann- 
sohenn Drive. He could sort out 
the ship’s next destination later. 

“Secure all for interstellar voy- 
age,” he ordered. Then, into the 




intercom microphone, ‘Take your 
prisoner to the wardroom. Major. 
We shall be along in a few min- 
utes.” 

- XIII 

T he prisoner, still with his guards, 
was in the wardroom when 
Grimes, Sonya and Mayherw got 
there. He was spacesuited still and 
manacled at wrists and ankles, and 
six Marines, stripped to the rags 
that were their uniform aboard this 
ship, were standing around him, ap- 
parently at ease but with their readi- 
ness to spring into action betrayed 
by a tenseness that was felt rather 
than seen. 

But for something odd about the 
articulation of the legs at the knee, 
but for the unhuman eyes glaring 
redly out through the narrow trans- 
parency of the helmet, this could 
have been one of the Major’s own 
men, still to be unsuited. And then 
Grimes noticed the tail. It was 
twitching inside its long, armored 
sheath. 

“Mr. Mayhew?” asked Grimes. 

“It . He’s not human, sir.” 
murmured the telepath. Grimes re- 
frained from making any remarks 
about a blinding glimpse of the ob- 
vious. “But I can read . after a 
fashion. There is hate, and there is 
fear. A dreadful, paralyzing fear.” 
The fear, thought Grimes, that 
any rational being will know when 
his maltreated slaves turn on him, 
gain the upper hand, 

“Strip him, sir?” asked the major. 
“Yes,” agreed Grimes. “Let’s see 
what he really looks like.” 



EDGE OF NIGHT

“Brown! Gilmore! Get the armor 
off the prisoner.” 

“We’ll have to take the irons 
off him first, sir,” pointed out one 
of the men dubiously. 

“There are six of you and only 
one of him. But if you want to be 
careful, unshackle his wrists first, 
then put the cuffs back on as soon 
as you have the upper half of his 
suit off.” 

“Very good, sir.” 

“I think that v/e should be care- 
ful,” said Sonya. 

“We are being careful, ma’am,” 
snapped the Major. 

Brown undipped a key ring from 
his belt, found the right key and 
unlocked the handcuffs, cautiously, 
alert for any hostile action on the 
part of the prisoner. But the being 
still stood there quietly, only that 
twitching tail a warning of poten- 
tial violence. Gilmore attended to 
the helmet fastenings, made a half 
turn and lifted the misshapen bowl 
of metal and plastic from the prison- 
er’s head. All of the humans stared 
at the face so revealed — the gray- 
furred visage with the thin lips 
crinikled to display the sharp, yellow 
teeth, the pK)inted, bewhiskered 
snout, the red eyes, the huge, cir- 
cular flaps that were the ears. The 
thing snarled shrilly, wordlessly. 
And there was the stink of it, vag- 
uely familiar, nauseating. 

Gilmore . expertly detached air 
tanks and fittings, peeled the suit 
down to the captive’s waist while 
Brown, whose full beard could not 
conceal his unease, pulled the 
sleeves down from the long, thin 
arms, over the clawlike hands. The 



sharp click as the handcuffs were 
replaced coincided with his faint 
sigh of relief. 

And when we start the interroga- 
tion, Grimes was wondering, shall 
we be up against the name, rank and 
serial number convention? 

Gilmore called another man to 
help him who, after Brown ^had 
freed the prisoner’s ankles, lifted 
one foot aher the other from its 
magnetic contact with the deck plat- 
ing. Gilmore continued stripping the 
captive, seemed to be ^getting into 
trouble as he tried to peel the armor 
from the scaly tail. He muttered 
something about not having enlisted 
to be a valet to bleeding snakes. 

Yes, it was like a snake, that tail. 
It was like a snake, and it whipped 
up suddenly, caught Gilmore about 
the throat and tightened, so fast that 
the strangling man could emit no 
more than a frightened grunt. And 
the manacled hands jerked up and 
then swept down violently, an dhad 
it not been for Brown’s shaggy mop 
of hair he would have died. And a 
clawed foot ripped one of the other 
men from throat to navel. 

I t was all so fast and so vicious. 

The being was fighting with a 
ferocity that was undiminished by 
the wounds that he was receiving 
and was raging through the com- 
partment like a tornado, a flesh and 
blood tornado with claws and teeth. 

Somebody had used his knife to 
slash Gilmore free, but he was out 
of the fight, as were Brown and the 
Marine with the ripped torso. Glob- 
ules of blood from the ragged gash 
mingled with the blood that spouted 



44 



IF 




from the stump of the severed tail, 
were dispersed by the violently ag- 
itated air to form a fine, sickening 
mist. 

Knives were out now. Grimes 
shouted that he wanted the prisoner 
alive, not dead. Knives were out — 
but the talented feet of the captive 
were as effective as the human wea- 
pons, and the manacled hands were 
a bone-crushing club. 

Even so — “Be careful!” Grimes 
was shouting. “Careful! Don’t kill 
him!” 

But Sonya was there, and she, of 
all those present, had come prepared 
for what was now happening. She 
had produced from somewhere in 
her scanty rags a tiny pistol. No 
more than a toy it looked. But it 
was no toy, and it fired anesthetic 
darts. She hovered on the outskirts 
of the fight, her weapon ready, 
waiting for the chance to use it. 
Once she fired — and the needle- 
pointed projectile sank into glisten- 
ing human skin, not matted fur. Yet 
another of the Marines was out of 
action. 

She had to get closer to be sure 
of hitting her target — the target that 
was at the center of a milling mass 
of arms and legs, human and non- 
human.. She had to get closer. And 
as she approached, sliding her mag- 
netized sandals over the deck in a 
deceptively rapid slouch, the being 
broke free of his caprtors, taking ad- 
vantage of the sudden lapse into un- 
consciousness of the man whom 
Sonya had hit with her first shot. 

She did not make a second one. 
The flailing arm of one of the men 
hit her gun hand, knocking the 



weapon from her grasp. And then 
the blood-streaked horror was on 
her, and the talons of one foot were 
hooked into the waistband of her 
rags and the other was upraised for 
a disembowelling stroke. 

Without thinking, without con- 
sciously remembering ah that he had 
been taught. Grimes threw his knife. 
But the lessons had -been good ones, 
and in this one branch of personal 
combat, the Commodore had been 
an aprt pupil. Blood spurted from a 
severed caratoid artery, and -the 
claws — bloody themselves, but with 
human blood — did no more, in their 
last spasmodic twitch, than inflict a 
shallow scratch between the wom- 
an’s breasts. 

Grimes ran to his wife, but she 
pushed him away, saying, “Don’t 
mind me. There are others more 
badly hurt.” 

And Mayhew was trying to say 
something to him, was babbling 
about his dead amplifier. Lassie, 
about her last and lethal dream. 

It made sense, but it had made 
sense to Grimes before the telepath 
volunteered his exiplanation. The 
Commodore had recognized the na- 
ture of the prisoner, in spite of the 
size of the being, in spite of the 
cranial development. In his younger 
days he had boarded a pest-ridden 
grain ship. He had recalled the ver- 
min that he had seen in the traps 
set by the ship’s crew, and the 
stench of them. 

And he remembered the old ad- 
age — that a cornered rat will fight. 

F reedom was falling down the 
dark dimensions, so far with no 



EDGE OF NIGHT 



45 




course set, so far with her destina- 
tion undecided. 

In Grimes’s daycabin there was a 
meeting of the senior officers of the 
expedition to discuss what had al- 
ready been learned, to make some 
sort of decision on what was to be 
done next. The final decision would 
rest with the Commodore. But he 
had learned, painfully, many years 
ago, that it is better to ask some of 
the questions than to know all the 
answers. 

The Major was telling his story 
again. “It wasn’t all that hard to get 
into the ship, sir. But they were 
waiting for us, in spacesuits, in the 
airlock vestibule. Some of them had 
pistols. As you know; we brought 
one back.” 

**Yes,” said Grimes. “I’ve seen it. 
A not very effective laser weapon. 
I think that our workshop can turn 
out copies— ^ith improvements.” 
“As you say, sir, not very effec- 
tive. Luckily for us. And I gained 
the impression that they were rather 
scared of using them. Possibly it 
was the fear of doing damage to 
their own ship.” He permitted him- 
self a slight sneer. “Typical, I sup- 
F>ose, of merchant spacemen.” 

“It’s easy to see. Major, that 
you’ve never had to write to Head 
Office to explain a half-inch dent in 
the shell plating. But carry on.” 
“There were hordes of them, sir, 
literally choking the alleyways. We 
tried to cut and burn and bludgeon 
our way through them, to get to the 
control room, and if you hadn’t re- 
called us we’d have done so.” 

“If I hadn’t recalled you, you’d be 
prisoners now — or dead. And better 



off dead at that. But tell me, were 
you able to notice anything about 
the ship herself?” 

“We were rather too busy, sir. Of 
course, if we’d been properly equip- 
ped, we’d have had at least two 
cameras As it was.” 

“I know. I know. You had noth- 
ing but spacesuits over your birth- 
day suits. But surely you gained 
some sort of impression.” 

“Just a ship, sir. All Alleyways, 
airtight doors and all the rest of it. 
Oh, yes. Fluorescent strips instead 
of luminescent panels. Old-fashion- 
ed ” 

“Sonya?” 

“Sounds like a mercantile version 
of this wagon, John. Or like a speci- 
men of Rim Runners’ vintage ton- 
nage.” 

“I>on’t be catty. And you, Doc- 
tor?” 

“So far,” admitted the medical 
officer, “I’ve made only a superfic- 
ial examination. But I’d say that 
our late prisoner was an Earth- 
type mammal. Male. Early middle 
age.” 

“And what species?” 

“I don’t know, Commodore. If 
we had thought to bring with us 
some laboratory white rats I could 
have run a comparison of tissues.” 

4 4Tn other words — you smell a 
X rat. Just as we all do.” He was 
speaking softly now. “Ever since the 
first ship, rats have been stowaways 
— ^in surface vessels, in aircraft, in 
spaceships. Carried to that planet in 
shipments of seed grain, they be- 
came a major pest on Mars. But, so 
far, we have been lucky. There have 



46 



IF 




been mutations, but never a muta- 
tion that has become a real menace 
to ourselves.” 

“Never?” asked Sonya with an 
arching of eyebrows. 

“Never, so far as we know, in 
our Universe.” 

“But in this one — ” 

“Too bloody right they are,” put 
in Williams. “Well, we know wihat’s 
cookin’ now, Sldp^. We still have 
one nuclear thimderflash in our 
stores. I vote that we use it and blow 
ourselves back to where we came 
from.” 

“I wish it were as simple as all 
that. Commander,” Grimes told 
him. “When we blew otmsdves here, 
the chances were that the ship would 
be returned to her own Space-Time. 
When we attempt to reverse the pro- 
cess there will be, I suppose, a cer- 
tain tendency for ourselves and the 
machinery and materials that we 
have installed to be sent back to 
our own Universe. But no more than 
a tendency. We shall be liable to 
find ourselves anywhere. Or any- 
when.” He paus^. “Not that it 
really worries any of us. We’re all 
volunteers, with no close ties left 
behind us. But we have a job to do, 
and I suggest that we at least try 
to do it before attempting a return.” 
“Then* what do we try to do. 
Skip?” demanded Williams. 

“We’ve made a start. Command- 
er. We know now what we’re up 
against. Intelligent, oversized rats 
who’ve enslaved Man at least on the 
Rim Worlds. Tell me, Sonya, you 
know more of the workings of the 
minds of Federation top brass, both 
military and political, than I do. Sup- 



pose this state of affairs had come 
to pass in our Universe? A hundred 
years ago, say, when the Rim Worlds 
were no more than a cluster of dist- 
ant colonies always annoying the 
Federation by demanding independ- 
ence?” 

She laughed bitterly. “As you 
know, there are planets whose hu- 
manoid inhabitants are subjects of 
the Shaara Empire. And on some 
of those worl^ the mammalian 
slaves of the ruling arthropods are 
more than merely humanoid. 
They’re human, descendants of 
ships’ crews and passengers cast 
away in the days of the Bhrenhaft 
Drive vessels, the so-called gauss- 
jammers. But we’d never dream of 
going to war against the Shaara to 
liberate our own flesh and blood. 
It just wouldn’t be . expedient. 
And I guess that in this space-time 
it just wouldn’t be expedient to go 
to war against these mutated rats. 
Too, there’ll be quite a large ibody 
of opinion that will say that the 
human Rim Worlders should be left 
to stew in their own juice.” 

“So you, our representative of the 
Federation’s armed forces, feel that 
we should accomplish nothing by 
making for Barth to tell our story.” 

“Not only should we accomplish 
nothing, but in all probability our 
ship would be confiscated and taken 
apart to see what makes her tick in- 
sofar as dimension hopping is con- 
cerned. And it would take us all a 
couple of lifetimes to break free of 
the red tape with which we should 
be festooned.” 

“In other words, if we want any- 
thing done we have to do it.”

“Yes.” 

“Then do we want anything 
done?” asked Grimes quietly. 

H e was almost frightened by the 
reaction provoked by his 
question. It seemed that not only 
would he have a mutiny on his 
hands, but also a divorce. Every- 
body was talking at once, loudly 
and indignantly. 

There was the Doctor’s high- 
pitched bray — “And it was human 
fles/h in the tissue culture vats!” and 
Williams’ roar, “You saw the bodies 
of the sheilas in this ship, an’ the 
scars on ’em!” and the Major’s curt 
voice, “The Marine Corps will carry 
on even if the Navy rats!” Then 
Sonya, icily calm, “I thought that 
the old-fashioned virtues still sur- 
vived on the Rim. I must have been 
mistaken.” 

“Quiet!” said Grimes. “Quiet!” 
he shouted. He grinned at his of- 
ficers. “All right. You’ve made your 
sentiments quite clear, and I’m 
pleased that you have. The late own- 
ers of this ship were intelligent be- 
ings — ^but that does not entitle them 



to treat other intelligent beings as 
their slaves. Sonya mentioned the 
human slaves on the worlds of the 
Shaara Empire — ^but those so-called 
slaves are far better off than many 
a free peasant on Federation worlds. 
They’re not maltreated. And they’re 
not livestock. But we’ve seen the 
bodies of the men, women and chil- 
dren who died aboard this ship. And 
if we can make their deaths not in 
vain — ” 

Sonya flashed him an apologetic 
smile. “But how?” she' asked. 

“That’s the question.” He turned 
to Mayhew. He said, “You’ve been 
maintaining a listening watch. Do 
these people have psionic radio?” 
“I’m afraid they do, sir,” the tele- 
path told him unhappily. “I’m afraid 
they do. And.” 

“Out with it, man.” 

“They use amplifiers, just as we 
do. But.” 

“But what?” 

“They aren’t dogs’ brains. They’re 
human ones.” 

And that was even worse than 
the discovery of thf' human flesh in 
the tissue culture vats had been.

The Face of the Deep 

by FRED SABERHAGEN 



T/ie sfar wos enormous and

— and could 



A fter five minutes had gone by 
with no apparent change in his 
situation, Karlsen realized that he 
might be going to live for a while 
yet. And as soon as this happened, 
as soon as his mind dared open its 
eyes again, so to speak, he began to 
see the depths of space around him 
and what they held. 

Not that there was much else for 
him to see, riding as he was in a 
crystalline bubble of a launch about 
twelve feet in diameter. The fortunes 
of war had dropped him here, half- 
way down the steepest gravitational 
hill in the known universe. 

At the unseeable bottom of this 
hill lay a sun so massive that not a 
quantum of light could escape it 
with a visible wavelength. In less 
than a minute he and his raindrop 
of a boat had fallen here, some un- 



never escape! 



measurable distance out of normal 
space, trying to escape an enemy 
which had remained in close pursuit. 
Karlsen was a religious man, and he 
had spent that falling minute in 
prayer, achieving something like 
calm, considering himself already 
dead. 

But after that minute, he was sud- 
denly no longer falling. He seemed 
to have entered an orhit, an orbit 
that no man had ever traveled be- 
fore, amid sights no eyes had ever 
seen. 

He rode above a thunderstorm at 
war with a sunset — a ceaseless, 
soundless turmoil of fantastic clouds 
that filled half the sky as a nearby 
planet would. But this mass was im- 
measurably bigger than any planet, 
bigger in fact than most giant stars. 
Its core and its cause, held forever 



49 




beyond human sight by its own 
power, was a hypermassive sun a 
billion times the weight of Sol. 

The clouds were interstellar dust, 
swept up by the pull of the hyper- 
mass, drawn to fall tumbling and 
churning into it. The clouds as they 
fell built up electrical static which 
was discharged in almost continous 
lightning. Karlsen saw as blue-white 
the neairer flashes and those ahead 
of him as he rode. But most of the 
flashes, like most of the clouds, were 
far below him, and so most of his 
light was sullen-red, wearied by 
climbing just a section of this gravity- 
cliff. Karlsen’s hittle bubbleship had 
ailifioLal gravity of its own and kept 
turning itself so its deck was down, 
so Karlsen saw the red light below 
him through the translucent deck, 
flaring up between his space-booted 
feet. He sat in the one massive chair 
which was fixed in the center of the 
bubble and which contained the 
boat’s controls and life-support ma- 
chinery. Below the deck were one 
or two other opaque objects, one of 
these a small but powerful space- 
warping engine. All else around Karl- 
sen was clear glass, holding in air, 
holding out radiation, but leaving his 
eyes and soul naked to the deeps of 
space around him. 

He took a full breath now and 
tried his engine, tried to lift himself 
up out of here. As he had expected, 
nothing happened at full drive. He 
might as well have been working 
bicycle pedals. 

E ven a slight change in his orbit 
would have beerl immediately 
visible to him, for his bubble was 



somehow locked in position within 
a narrow belt of rocks and dust that 
stretched like a threat to girdle the 
vastness below him. Before the 
thread could bend perceptibly on its 
great circle it lost its identity in 
distance, merging with other 
threads into a thicker strand. This 
in turn was braided with other 
strands into a heavier belt, and so 
on, order above order of size, until 
at last (a hundred thousand miles 
ahead? A million?) the first bending 
of the great ring-pattern was percep- 
tible; and then the arc, rainbow- 
colored at that point by lightning, 
deepened swiftly, plunging out of 
sight below the terrible horizon of 
the hypermass’s shroud of dust. The 
fantastic cloud-shapes of that hori- 
zon, which Karlsen knew must be 
millions of miles from him, grew 
closer while he looked at them. Such 
was the speed of his orbit. 

His orbit, he guessed, must be 
roughly the size of Earth’s path 
around Sol. But judging by the way 
the surface of clouds was turning 
beneath him, he would complete a 
full circuit every fifteen minutes or 
so. This was madness, to outspeed 
light in normal space — but then 
of course space was not normal 
here. It could not be. These insane 
orbiting threads of dust and rock 
suggested that here gravity had 
formed itself into lines of force, like 
magnetism. 

The orbiting threads of debris 
above Karlsen’s traveled less rapidly 
than his. In the nearer threads be- 
low him, he could distinguish indi- 
vidual rocks, passing him up like the 
teeth of a buzzsaw. His mind re-

IF 




coiled from those teeth, from the 
sheer grandeur of speed and distance 
and size. 

He sat in his chair looking up 
at the stars. Distantly he wondered 
if he might be growing younger, 
moving backward in the time of the 
universe from which he had fallen 
. he was no professional mathe- 
matician or physicist, but he thought 
not. That was one trick the universe 
could not pull, even here. But the 
chances were that in this orbit he 
was aging quite slowly compared 
with the rest of the human race. 

He realized that he was huddling 
in his chair like an awed child, his 
fingers cramping painfully inside 
their gauntlets with the intensity of 
his grip on the chair arms. He forced 
himself to try to relax, to begin 
thinking of routine matters. He had 
survived worse things than this dis- 
play of nature, if none more awful. 

He had air and water and food 
enough, and power to keep recycling 
them as long as necessary. His engine 
was good for that much. 

He studied the line of force, or 
whatever it was, that held him 
prisoner. The larger rocks within it, 
some of which approached his bub- 
ble in size, seemed never to change 
their relative positions. But smaller 
chunks drifted with some freedom 
backward and forward, at very low 
velocities. 

H e got up from his chair and turn- 
ed. A single step to the rear 
brought him to the curve of glass. 
He looked out, trying to spot his 
enemy. 

Sure enough, following half a mile 



behind him, caught in the same string 
of space-debris, was the berserker- 
ship whose pursuit had driven him 
here. It was a machine fastened on 
one purpose — Karlsen’s death. Its 
scanners would be fixed on his bub- 
ble now and were probalbly able to 
see him moving. If it coidd get at 
him it would do so. The berserker- 
computers would waste no time in 
awed contemplation of the scenery, 
that much was certain. 

His bubbleboat was unarmed, but 
the berserker wasn’t. Why wasn’t it 
firing? 

As if to answer his thought the 
flare of a beam-weapon struck out 
from the launch. But the beam look- 
ed odd and silvery, and it plowed 
only ten feet or so among exploding 
rocks and dust before fizzling away 
like a comic firework. It left added 
dust in a cloud that seemed to be 
thickening around the berserker. 
Probably the machine had kept on 
firing at him all along, but this weird 
space would not tolerate energy 
weapons. Missiles, then? 

Yes, missiles. He watched the ber- 
serker launch one. The cylinder 
made one fiery dart in his direction, 
then disappeared. Where had it gone? 
Fallen in toward the hypermass? At 
invisible speed, if so. 

As soon as he spotted the first 
flare of another missile, Karlsen on 
a hunch turned his eyes quickly 
downward. He saw an instant spark 
and puff in the next lower line of 
force, a tooth knocked out of the 
buzzsaw. The puff where the missile 
had struck flew ahead at insane 
speed, passing out of Karlsen’s sight 
almost at once. His eyes were drawn 



THE FACE OF THE DEEP 



51 




after it, and he realized he had been 
watching the berserker-ship not with 
fear but with something like relief, 
as a distraction from facing ... all 
this. 

“Ah, God,” he said aloud, look- 
ing ahead. It was a prayer, not an 
oath. Far beyond the slow-ohurning 
infinite horizon, there were mon- 
strous dragon-head clouds rearing up. 
Against the blackness of space their 
mother-of-pearl heads seemed to be 
formed by matter materializing out 
of nothingness to plunge toward the 
hypermass. Soon the dragons’ necks 
rose over the edge of the world, rain- 
bow purls of matter, dripping and 
falling with unreal speed down into 
the hypermass. And then the dragon- 
bodies, clouds throbbing with blue- 
white lightning above the red bowels 
of hell. 

The vast ring, in which Karlsen’s 
thread of rocks was one component, 
raced like a circular sawblade to- 
ward the prominences. As they came 
flying over the horizon they rose up 
far beyond Karlsen’s level. They 
twisted and reared like mad horses. 
They must be bigger than planets, he 
thought, yes, bigger than a thousand 
Earths or Esteels. The whirling band 
he rode was going to be crushed be- 
tween them — and then he saw that 
even as they passed they were still 
enormously distant from him on 
either side. ^ 

Still standing, Karlsen let his 
eyes ^lose for a time. If men ever 
dared to pray, if they ever dared 
even to think of a Creator of the uni- 
verse, it was only because their tiny 
minds had never been able to visu- 
alize a thousandth part ... a million- 



th part . there were no words, 
no concepts, for sights like these. 

And what of men who believed 
only in themselves, or in nothing? 
What might it do to them to look 
nakedly at such odds as these? 

K arlsen opened his eyes. In his 
belief a single human was more 
important to the Creator than any 
sun of whatever size. He made him- 
self watch the scenery. He deter- 
mined to master this almost super- 
stitious awe. 

But he had to brace himself again 
when he noticed for the first time 
how the stars were behaving. They 
were all blue-white needles, the wave- 
fronts of their light jammed together 
in a stampede over the cliff of gravi- 
ty. And his speed was such that he 
saw some stars moving slightly in 
parallax shifts. He could have depth 
perception in light-years, if his mind 
could stretch that far. 

He stepped back to his chair, sat 
down and fastened himself in. He 
wanted to dig himself a tunnel, down 
into the very core of a huge planet, 
where he could hide . but what 
were even the biggest planets? Poor 
lost specks, hardly bigger than this 
bubble. 

Here he faced no ordinary space- 
man’s view of infinity. Here there 
was a terrible perspective, starting 
with rocks just outside the glass and 
drawing the mind on and out, rock 
by rock and line by line, step by 
inescapable step, on and on and 
on — 

All right. At least this was some- 
thing to fight against, and fighting 
something was better than sitting

IF 




here and rotting. To begin with, a 
little routine. He drank some water, 
which tasted very good, and made 
himself eat a bite of food. He was 
going to be around for a while yet. 

Now for the little job of getting 
used to the scenery without going 
mad. He faced in the direction of 
his bubble’s flight. 

Half a dozen meters ahead of him 
the first large rock, massive as the 
bodies of a dozen men, hung steadily 
in the orbit-line of force. With his 
mind he weighed this rock and 
measured it and then moved on to 
the next notable chunk, a pebble’s 
throw further. The rocks were each 
smaller than his bubble, and he could 
follow the string of them on and on, 
until it was swallowed in the con- 
verging pattern of forcelines that at 
last bent around the hypermass, de- 
fining the full terror of distance. 

His mind hanging by its fingertips 
swayed out along the intervals of 
grandeur . like a baby monkey 
blinking in jungle sunlight, he 
thought. Like an infant climber who 
had been terrified by the size of 
trees and vines, who now saw them 
for the first time as a network of 
roads that could be mastered. 

Now he dared to let his eyes grab 
hard at that buzzsaw rim of the next 
inner circle of hurtling rocks, to let 
his mind ride it out and away. Now 
he dared to watch the stars shifting 
with his movement, to see with the 
depth perception of a plant. 

H e had been through a lot even 
before his ship had fallen here, 
and sleep overtook him. Suddenly 
loud noises were waking him up. 



He came full awake with a start of 
fear. The berserker was not helpless 
after all. Two of its man-sized ma- 
chines were outside his glassy door, 
working on it. Karlsen reached au- 
tomatically for his handgun. The lit- 
tle weapon was not going to do him 
much good, but he waited, holding 
it ready. There was nothing else- to 
do. 

Something was strange in the ap- 
pearance of the deadly robots out- 
side; they were silvered with 
a gleaming coating. It looked like 
frost except that it formed only on 
their forward surfaces and stream- 
ed away from them toward the rear 
in little fringes and tails, like an 
artist’s speed-lines made solid. The 
figures were solid enough. Their 
hammer-blows at his door . but 
wait. His fragile door was not being 
forced. The metal killers outside 
were tangled and slowed in the silv- 
ery webbing with which this mad 
rushing space had draped them. The 
stuff damped their laser beams, when 
they tried to burn their way in. It 
muffled the explosive they set off. 

When they had tried everything 
they departed, pushing themselves 
from rock to rock back toward their 
metal mother, wearing their white 
flaming surfaces like hoods of de- 
feat. 

He yelled relieving insults after 
them. He thought of opening his 
door and firing his pistol after them. 
He wore a spacesuit, and if they 
could open the door of the berserker- 
ship from inside he should be able 
to open this one. But he decided 
that it would be a waste of ammun- 
ition to even try. 



THE FACE OF THE DEEP 



53 




S ome deep part of his mind had 
_ concluded that it was better for 
him, in his present situation, not to 
think about Time. He saw no rea- 
son to argue with this decision, and 
so he soon lost track of hours and 
days — weeks? 

He exercised and shaved, he ate 
and drank and eliminated. The 
boat’s recycling systems worked very 
well. He happened to have aboard 
a device that would let him freeze 
himself into suspended animation — 
but no thanks, at least not yet. The 
possibility of rescue was in his 
thoughts, mixing hope with his fears 
of Time. 

He knew that on the day he fell 
down here there was no ship built 
capable of coming after him and 
pulling him out. But ships were al- 
ways being improved. Suppose he 
could hang on here for a few weeks, 
or months, while a few years passed 
outside. He knew he was important 
to many important people, and that 
an attempt to save him would be 
made if it looked at all possible. 

From being awed, almost para- 
lyzed by his surroundings, he passed 
through a stage of exaltation and 
then quickly reached — boredom. 
The mind had its own business and 
turned itself away from all these 
eternal blazing miracles. He slept a 
good deal. 

In a dream he saw himself stand- 
ing alone in space. He viewed him- 
self ^t the distance where the hu- 
man figure dwindles almost to a 
speck in the gaze of the unaided 
human eye. With an almost invisible 
arm, himself-in-the-distance waved 
good-by and then went walking 



away, headed out toward the blue- 
white stars. The striding leg move- 
ments were at first barely percepti- 
ble and then became nothing at all 
as the figure dwindled, losing exis- 
tence against the face of the deep . 

With a yeU he woke up. A space- 
boat had nudged against his crystal 
hull and was now bobbing a few 
feet away. It was a solid metal ovoid, 
of a model he recognized, and the 
numbers and letters on its hull were 
familiar to him. 

He had made it. He had hung on. 
The ordeal was over. 

The little hatch of the rescue boat 
opened, and two suited figures 
emerged, one after the other, from 
its sheltered interior. At once these 
figures became silver-blurred as the 
berserker’s machines had been, but 
these men’s features were visible 
through their faceplates, their eyes 
looking straight at Karlsen. They 
smiled in steady encouragement, 
never taking their eyes from his. 

Not for an instant. 

They rapped on his door and kept 
smiling while he put on his spacesuit. 
But he made no move to let them in; 
instead he drew his gun. 

They frowned. Inside their hel- 
mets their mouths formed words: 
Open up! He flipped on his radio, 
but if they were sending, nothing 
was coming through in this space. 
They kept on gazing steadily at him. 

Wait, he signaled with an upraised 
hand. He got a slate and stylus from 
his chair and wrote them a message. 

LOOK AROUND AT THE 
SCENERY FOR A WHILE. 

He was sane, but maybe they 
thought him mad. As if to humor 



54 



IF 




him, they began to look around 
them. A new set of dragons’-head 
prominences were rising ahead, be- 
yond the stormy horizon at the rim 
of the world. The frowning men 
looked ahead of them at dragons, 
around them at buzzsaw rainbow 
whirls of stone; they looked down 
into the sullen depths of the inferno, 
they looked up at the stars’ poisonous 
blue-white spears sliding visibly over 
the void. 

Then both of them, still frowning 
uncomprehendingly, looked right 
back at Karlsen. 

H e sat in his chair, holding his 
drawn gun and waiting, having 
no more to say. He knew that the 
berserker-ship would have had boats 
aboard and that it could build its 
killing machines into rough like- 
nesses of men. These were almost 
good enough to fool him. 

The figures outside produced a 
slate of their own from somewhere. 

WE TOOK BERS. FROM BE- 
HIND. ALL OK & SAFE. COME 
OUT. 

He looked back. The cloud of dust 
raised by the berserker’s own use- 
less weapons had settled around it, 
hiding it and all the force-line behind 
it from Karlsen’s view. Oh, if only 
he could believe that these were 
men . 

They gestured energetically and 
lettered some more. 

SHIP WAITING BACK THERE 
BEHIND DUST. SHE’S TOO BIG 
TO HOLD THIS LEVEL LONG. 
And again: 

KARLSEN, COME WITH US!!! 
THIS YOUR ONLY CHANCE! 



He didn’t dare read any more of 
their messages for fear he would be- 
lieve them, rush out into their metal 
arms and be torn apart. He closed 
his eyes and prayed. 

After a long time he opened his 
eyes again. His visitors and their boat 
were gone. 

Not long afterward — as tune 
seemed to him — there were flash- 
es of light from inside the dust cloud 
surrounding the berserker. A fight 
to which someone had brought 
weapons that would work in this 
space? Or another attempt to trick 
him? He would see. 

He was watching alertly as an- 
other rescue boat, much like the 
first, inched its way out of the dust- 
cloud toward him. It drew alongside 
and stopped. Two more spacesuited 
figures got out and began to wear 
silver drapery. 

This time he had his sign ready. 

LOOK AROUND AT THE 
SCENERY FOR A WHILE. 

As if to humor him, they began 
to look around them. Maybe they 
thought him mad, but he was sane. 
After about a minute they still hadn’t 
turned back to him — one’s face 
looked up and out at the unbelieva- 
ble stars, while the other slowly 
swiveled his neck, watching a drag- 
on’s head go by. Gradually their 
bodies became congealed in awe and 
terror, clinging to his glass wall. 

After taking half a minute more 
to check his own helm and suit, 
Karlsen opened his door. 

“Welcome, men,” he said, over 
his helmet radio. He had to help 
one of them aboard the rescue boat. 
But they made it. END

Some of the tavern’s patrons, 
mostly Spacers from Hephaestus 
and Poseidon, were either dead 
drunk or working their way toward 
that happy state with a dexterity 
marvelous to behold. The natives, 
however, had far too many troubles 
to drown them in alcohol successful- 
ly. They hunched morosely over 
their drinks, the look of stolid res- 
ignation on their faces seldom 
changing except when a patrol of 
Keres checked in on their nightly 
rounds. 

The only sounds were the whine 
of the wind, the low drone of whis- 
pered conversation and an occa- 
sional roar of displaced air as a Far 
Traveler knifed down from space 
toward the starport in the adjacent 
High Town. The tavern was filled 
with the reek of human sweat and 
the absence of laughter. 

Apart from the others, nestled 
against the base of one of the great 
supporting pillars, sat the Empty 
Man. He was a tall, dark man with 
a face as unshakeaibly impassive as 
carven granite. For over an hour he 
had neither spoken nor moved, eyes 
fixed intently on nothing and seem- 
ing to peer deep, deep into strange 
worlds where ordinary humans 
never could, or should, venture. 

The other people in the tavern 
shunned him With a savage distaste 
that came very close to fear. There 
was something about the grim, 
brooding figure that awakened the 
instinctive hatred of the alien that 
slumbers in every man. Somehow 
they could sense, with the near- 
atrophied senses bequeathed them 
by their primeval ancestors, that 



here was the unnatural, the danger- 
ous. Yet, there was fascination 
mixed with the fear, the insatiable 
curiosity of homo sapiens toward 
anything out of the ordinary. 

“Oh, he’s a strange one, he is,” 
they whispered. “Fd stay well away 
from him , I would, if I were you.” 

J hon Oharlton, unaware of the 
stir he was causing, swirled 
the murky liquid in his glass and 
drank. 

His thoughts, as usual, were dark. 
Even though he knew it was im- 
possible, he was contemplating 
suicide, as he had every evening for 
three years since the Day. He had 
discarded drowning, disembowelling 
and disintegration and was consid- 
ering the possibility of drinking him- 
self to death when the first warning 
tingle shuddered through his frame. 

Instantly, his thoughts were .scat- 
tered. His every muscle became in- 
discernibly tense. He knew the sign 
well. It indicated that the being he 
had pflayed host to for three years, 
that shared his mind and body and, 
displaying both a sense of irony and 
a frightening knowledge of human 
folkways, chose to call itself Moros, 
was awakening. 

Even as he waited, as quiveringly 
taut as a drawn bowstring, some de- 
tached portion of his mind was 
searching for the proper tag to hang 
upon his relationship with his un- 
invited companion. Not symbiosis; 
neither performed any vital or help- 
ful function for the other. Not par- 
asitic either; the creature didn’t take 
any nourishment or energy from 
him, if indeed it needed any at all. 



THE EMPTY MAN 



57 




Moros spoke. It was something 
beyond the telepathy that humans 
kn^, a voice, like the muted music 
of a thousand woodwinds, singing 
softly in his head. In a split second, 
the blink of an eye, an entire mental 
conversation was carried out. 

“You were wrong, Jhon,” the 
alien’s ‘voice* was dry and biting. 
“In a way, our relationship could be 
called symbiosis. I supply you with 
something very valuable, something 
most men haven’t got: a conscience. 
As for your part of the bargain — 
well, some day I will indicate how 
you will be able to repay me.” 

“Go to hell.” 

“Come, Jhon. You are a most 
fortunate man, and you should be a 
most grateful one. I fear you are be- 
ing unfair.” 

“Damn you I I should be grate- 
ful, you say? For what? Before you 
came, I was a whole man. I en- 
joyed using my talents when I was 
on a mission. Now, nothing! No 
emotions. No fear or exultation, no 
discomfort or pleasure — ^nothing! 
Why won’t you leave me alone? 
Give me back my soul!” 

“Not yet.” 

“Damn you!” 

“Your vocabulary is neither var- 
ied nor erudite. And Jhon — ^you still 
don’t feel the slightest twinge of 
guHt over what you’ve done, do 
you?” 

“Why should I? Leave me alone.” 
“Not yet. Some day perhaps.” 

“GO to heH.” 

M oros lapsed into silence, and 
Charlton fell to studying his 
fellow patrons. 



The aura of hopeless dejection 
about them only served to heighten 
bis own sense of gloom and futility. 
Looking out over the slouching 
forms of the natives, he called up 
nostalgic memories of past missions 
before the Day. He could feel the 
raw energy that was his to control 
pulsating througth every fiber of his 
being, and he knew that all he had 
to do was concentrate, and that en- 
ergy would surge forth — ^to blast, 
to kill, to destroy — 

“How does it feel to be God, 
Jhon?” 

“Damn you!” Charlton screamed 
aloud, jumping to his feet, his fists 
knotted and ready to smash, to 
pulp his enemy .... 

Slowly he became aware of the 
dozens of hostile eyes trained un- 
blinkingly upon him from every 
corner of the room. Mumbling 
something unintelligible, he slumped 
back into his seat. The bartender 
tapped his forehead significantly, 
and the rest of the customers, nod- 
ding sagely in agreement, turned 
away. 

“TTie last of the Immortals. The 
last of the Gods, that’s you Jhon. 
First there was Osiris, Odin, Zeus — 
and now, Charlton, the almighty. 
Worship held on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays. In case of rain — ” 

“Shut up! Just shut up! Where in 
hell is that contact? Blast him, he 
was supposed to have arrived five 
minutes ago.” 

Whooml With a tremendous, 
splintering crash, the tavern door 
was torn off its hinges and flung 
clattering across the floor. A squad 
of Keres dashed into the room.

most of whom were afraid to fire lest

his head. “I’ll have to blast my way

A tiny sliver of light appeared in 
the floor on the right. Slowly, a 
square piece of the floor about four 
feet wide swung up and to the side. 
Light poured up from below. A 
head poked its^ cautiously over 
the lip of the opening and urgently 
cried a certain code word. Charlton 
replied in kind. The man scrambled 
nimbly up and seized Charlton by 
the ‘arm. “Charlton? Jhon Charl- 
ton?” 

“Yes.” 

“Quick man, into the tunnel. 
God, what a bloody foul-up!” 

But as Charlton lowered himself 
through the trapdoor, he knew it 
was more than an ordinary snafu. 

Somewhere there was a traitor. 

II 

I t took them five minutes to nav- 
igate the tunnel. At last fresh, 
cold air lashed their faces, and they 
found themselves in the Street of 
Fools. 

Charlton got his first good look 
at his companions. They were rag- 
ged, dark men. They radiated a 



quiet kind of fanaticism, the revolu- 
tionary fervor that at one time or 
another sweeps every race of man. 
No one spoke. 

Apollon’s night was moonless; the 
only illumination was cold starligjit. 
By this wan glow, Oharlton saw long 
knives glimmering wickedly in the 
hands otf the rebels. He smiled. 
Overhead, a Far Traveler, only a 
tiny speck in the distance, drifted 
slowly and silendy down toward the 
Starport. 

The sound of running f^t rever- 
berated through the hush of the de- 
serted street. Charlton and the 
rebels shrank back into the shadows 
as a squad of Keres, weapons at the 
ready, double4iimed past and dis- 
appeared into the tavern. 

The leader of the rebels glared at 
Charlton. “The tavern will be under 
new management tomorrow,” he 
muttered grimly. “All those people 
— ” He shook his head slowly. 
“Mister, I sure as hell hope you’re 
worth it.” 

He spmn on his heel and stalked 
away, followed by the others. As 
he walked, Oharlton tapped his en- 
ergy reserves, concentrated and 
swMdy scanned the minds of his 
companions. 

The little one on the left was a 
psychopathic killer. He radiated 
blood lust so strongly that even 
non-Espers could sense it. His mind 
was a procession of gory memories 
and even grislier desires; the latest 
tableau involved his eager anticipa- 
tion of the day when he would 
plunge his long knife deep into 
Charlton’s stomach. Evidently the 
little killer didn’t think much of

IF 




Charlton’s alleged prowess. The 
need to prove he could “take” the 
outiworlder burned intently within 
him. I’ll have troubie with him be- 
fore aM this is over, the Empty Man 
reflected. 

The thoughts of the other three 
men were grimly centered on the 
business at hand, but Charlton could 
catch traces of indecision concern- 
ing his worth in their minds also. 

He grinned wryly. None of his 
companions suspected that they 
were doubting ^e ability of the 
most dangerous living creature in 
the known galaxy. 

They walked on. Around them 
echoed the unnatural silence that 
settled on High Delphi like a cloak 
every evening after sunset. The men 
ignored each other, every member 
of the party wrapped introspectively 
in their own mediations. Charlton 
probed psionically at the four fetal- 
ly-ourled cores of desires, fears and 
aspirations that were human egos, 
searching out the personality roots 
of others with desperate urgency to 
hide from himself his intense fear 
of turning his strange gift inward. 

B uried deep in the brain of the 
Empty Man was an area p>ost- 
ed: DANGER! KEEP OUT! An 
area filled \Vith knowledge, self- 
knowledge fatal to his present per- 
sonality. Personality is self-delusion, 
internal censorship. Somewhere in 
every man is a tiny pwDrtion of the 
subconscious that remembers the 
minutest detail of existence and 
knows all the sets of values and 
motivations that go together to make 
up a human ego. The mind acts as 
THE EMPTY MAN 



its own censor to fence off this part 
of itsedf, for knowledge of the caus- 
es of a man’s secret motivations of- 
ten destroys the motivations them- 
selves and so dissolves the tenuous 
pattern of automatic responses 
known as personality. 

If another Esper had been pres- 
ent to rifle through Charlton’s in- 
nermost thoughts as he himself was 
delving into the rebel’s, he would 
have found in this forbidden area a 
frightening conglomeration of dark 
symbols and repressed memories. 
Chief among these were two care- 
fully avoided trains of thought that 
continued to haunt him in recurrent 
nightmares. 

One was the painful recollection 
of the ten-year j>eriod of scientific 
experimentation that had turned 
him into the inhuman juggernaut of 
destruction he now was and his 
strong, but deeply buried, feelings of 
guilt over his wild years when he 
used his godlike power ruthlessly to 
break all known laws and moralities. 
The second was the powerful psych- 
ic shook he had received at the 
Cube of Darkness on Milhar II, 
where he had been possessed by the 
alien doorwarder Moros, as punish- 
ment for his accidental slaughter of 
an immense number of Moros’s race 
during an attempt to unravel the 
enigma of the C^be. His subcon- 
scious pulsed with dangerous knowl- 
edge, like a gigantic cancer or boil 
on the verge of erupting and send- 
ing a flood of contamination into 
his conscious mind, held hack only 
by the power of his iron will. 

And that will was fraying. 

The leader of the rebels signaled 

61 




a halt. “Patrol of Keres stationed 
ahead.” he whispered. “They’re 
named after the olditimie god of 
violent death, y’know, and for good 
reason. If they should catch us — ” 
He drew his forefinger meaning- 
fully across his throat. “Death by 
laser is a bad way to go.” He 
glanced sidelong at Charlton. 

The Empty Man smiled. This was 
a test. Obviously the rebels had 
methods of avoiding the Keres, and 
Charlton was supposed to prove his 
mettle by figuring one of them out 
himself. But he would go them one 
better. 

“Stay here. I’ll take care of 
them,” Charlton whispered and 
slipped away before the flabbergast- 
ed rebel could protest or try to stop 
him. 

The rebel captain, whitefaced and 
tremblings took a deep, shuddering 
breath. “He’s crazy. By the Holy 
Rame! He’ll get us all killed!” 

Silent as a specter, Jhon Charlton 
flitted through the shadowy streets 
of the High Town. Ahead, in the 
Plaza of Madmen, ten Keres were 
stationed. They huddled around a 
small solar heater, shivering in the 
cold of Apollon’s long night. White 
jets of vapor curled from every 
mouth; they stamped their feet and 
cursed softly as they tried to keep 
their fingers from sticking to the 
frigid metal of their weapons. A 
young boy shifted the rifle in his 
hands and turned his head in order 
to glance look at the other side of 
the Plaza. 

Before he could turn it back, 
something streaked from the cover 
of a building’s shadow. 



D eath walked abroad in the 
Plaza of Madmen. Charlton 
whlpj>ed through the Keres like a 
living blur. He smashed and ham- 
mered them down, hurled them to 
the ground with lethal force, 
stamped them, broke them in half, 
crushed them. It was like trying to 
fight some grim, tireless machine; 
the Keres had no more chance than 
a litter of kittens facing a maddened 
tiger. Bones snapped under Charl- 
ton’s hands; flesh tore ^and blood 
flowed. 

Within twenty seconds, ten bodies 
were strewn all over the Plaza, and 
no shot had been fired. Charlton 
hadn’t even given thepi time to 
scream. 

The Empty Man stood alone 
among the carnage. And yearned 
savagely for death. 

All through the bloody slaughter, 
he had felt nothing — neither revul- 
sion nor delight. He was still a shell, 
a caricature of a man. The temper- 
ature of his blood had not even 
risen one degree. 

‘Too easy, wasn’t it? Like a boy 
squashing ants.” 

“Shut up, damn you!” 

Slowly, reluctantly, the rebel 
band approached. Awe was written 
now on every face, and fear and re- 
vulsion were in every mind, except 
the little killer’s; hate and fierce 
jealousy smoldered like a hot ember 
in his twisted brain. Repressing a 
surge of nausea, the rebel captain 
led them across the Plaza and into 
the tangled maze of streets on the 
far side. Charlton noted that his 
companions were careful to keep a 
healthy distance away, zealously 



62 



IF 




avoiding contact with him. It was 
as if he were now a plague carrier. 

“Even if they were Redhands,” 
one whispered to another, “nobody 
should have to die like that. They 
didn’t have a chance.” 

“I don’t care much about a bunch 
of stinking ProTects,” the other an- 
swered, “But what he did was im- 
possible. It wasn’t human.” His 
voice trembled. “Just .not human.” 
“Human enough to die when he 
gets a knife in his guts,” the little 
killer muttered grinily. 

Charlton’s ears were far more 
acute than any there suspected. His 



mouth curled in a hybrid of smile 
and snarl. Men fear^ him or re- 
spected him, but none offered him 
companionship, God has no friends. 

They pressed on toward the out- 
skirts of the city. They saw no one. 
It was iU to travel the streets of 
High Delphi at night, and only Keres 
and the foolhardy did so. 

Twice they were forced to con- 
ceal themselves as the private 
groundcar of some rich merchant 
sped toward the pleasure houses in 
the center of the city. Once a Kere 
troop-transport and an armored 
half-track roared past, red lights

flashing and sirens wailing eerily, 
while they crouched in the shadows; 
they caught a glimpse of a fighter 
hovercraft in the distance, skimming 
low over the rooftops, infrared 
spots probing. 

“Maybe the fact that Jhon 
Charlton is on this planet means 
nothing to you,” the Empty Man 
commented as they emerged from 
their hiding place. “But I’ll wager 
that the Protector is much 

more concerned. This is only the 
beginning. By morning, the search 
will have doubled, tripled. The gov- 
ernment will turn Apollon inside- 
out to find me. I suggest that we 
get to our destination quickly.” 

The rebel captain nodded. “I pity 
the poor murderer or rapist who 
tries to ply his trade tonight. And 
thank the Flame that we started 
early enough to slip through the 
net before it could fully close! 
We’ve reached our destination; our 
headquarters is across the street.” 

Charlton glanced in the direction 
indicated. A small, rather shabby, 
four-story building, with a definite 
air of decay about it squatted 
among a cluster of similar or worse 
structures on the fringe of the city. 
Conspicuous in contrast with the 
peeling paint and weathered mason- 
ry was a large, brightly polished 
bronze plaque, riveted to the wall 
over the door. It read: BEGGARS’ 
UNION — LOCAL HEADQUAR- 
TERS. HIGH DELPHI; and un- 
derneath, in smaller letters:' AF- 
FILIATED WITH THE JESTERS’ 
GUILD. 

Charlton arched an eyebrow in 
RUiprise. “This your headquarters?” 



The rebel captain grinned. “Why 
not? No one suspects clowns and 
beggars. Until it’s too late.” 

Ill 

D mton Arzur, Master Thief and 
head of the revolutionary 
movement on Apollon, studied his 
guest warily over the rim of his 
glass. 

“I’d drink with the devil were he 
my guest,” he said, “and I’ll drink 
with you now however thfngs turn 
out.” 

Jhon Charlton smiled and scan- 
ned the room with a caution that 
was as instinctive as breathing. This 
was a high level meeting; only 
Arzur’s four chief lieutenants were 
present. Sket Hyman, the rebel cap- 
tain who had convoyed Charlton 
from the tavern, perched atop a 
packing case on the right holding a 
silent but deadly needlebeam pistol 
in one hand. Jay Benjamin, chief 
jester at the High Citadel, lounged 
full length on a huge, dusty filing 
cabinet on the left. He was a tall, 
lithe man with a strong-featured, 
sardonic face and hawklike piercing 
eyes. Jarringly out of place with his 
bright, gaily colored clothes was an 
illegal, high-power blaster tucked 
casually into his sash. Jvai, the little 
psychopathic killer, squatted close 
to the door, toying with his gjim- 
mering knife and eying Charlton 
with savage hunger. Arzur’s mis- 
tress, Vye, a tall, beautiful woman 
with raven hair, stood behind her 
lover’s desk, one hand resting light- 
ly on his shoulder. 

Charlton’s eyes flicked back to 



64 



IF 




Arzur. He was phenomenaJly young 
to be the leader, of a reibei under- 
ground. He was aibout Ohiadton’s 
age, somewhere in his middle thir- 
ties. 

The Empty Man drained his glass 
and then lau'^ed softly; he had de- 
tected the alien substance imme- 
diately, of course. “I always find 
truth serums quite delicious,” he 
said. “DR- 119, made from Karov- 
ian tree melons, is it not? It is? Ex- 
cellent! I thought I could recognize 
the flavor.” 

Hyman swore, but Arzur looked 
genuinely interested. “And it has 
no effect on you?” he asked. 

“None whatsoever, I assure you. 
Observe: I am a spotted tyran- 
nosaurus. Satisfied?” 

Arzur grinned wryly. “Either you 
are immune or you have on a most 
excellent disguise.” 

Chariton slowly crushed his glass. 
“Enough of these chiildren’s games. 
Let us iget down to business.” 

Arzur nodded. “Most certainly.” 
He glanced slowly around the room. 

“When this portion of galactic 
space, ithe so-called Olympian sec- 
tor, was first settled about four 
hundred years ago, the head of the 
expedition sent to Apollon had a 
very fine idea. He decided to sever 
relations with Terra and set him- 
self up as a dictator; the mother 
planet was so far away that it was 
impossible for her to interfere. He 
did so, becoming the first High 
Protector of Apollon. 

“Thus, while we share a common 
cultural background with our neigh- 
bor planets — the secret police are 
called Kieres all over this sector of 



space for instance — we ore the 
only Olympian region that doesn’t 
belong to thiat portion of the Ter- 
ran Empire known as the Olym- 
pian Protectorate. This is just finfe 
for the High Protector. All profit 
made from trade with the Protector- 
ate planets goes into his pockets, 
but the average citizen must suffer 
tyranny and poverty. Thb common 
man on Apollon has a far lower 
standard of living than the common 
man on Hephaestus or Poseidon. 

“These adverse conditions pro- 
duced us: a rebel underground. We 
struggled along for years with little 
success. Then, two months ago, we 
were contacted by a representative 
of the Terr an Empire. He said that 
Terra was interested in liberating 
us from the tyranny of the High 
Protector and would help us over- 
throw the government — ” 

“Damn nice of Terra, wasn’t it?” 
Jay Benjamin muttered. 

A rzur threw the jester a quick 
glance and then continued. 
“Although I must admit,” Arzur 
said, “that I don’t understand why 
Terra doesn’t stop trade between 
A{x>llon and the Protectorate plan- 
ets if she wishes to topple the High 
Protector. Bankruptcy would un- 
dermine the government in a month.” 
Charlton smiled inscrutably. “My 
dear sir, you fail to grasp the basic 
laws of high finance. ■ Revolutions 
are one thing, losing money quite 
another.” 

“Very interesting, honorable 
Earthman,” the dry voice of Jay 
Benjamin interrupted. “But I would 
like to inquire w*hy it took Terra

four ihundred years to work up 
en6ugh patriotic favor to attempt 
our liberation. For centuries the Em- 
pire has let Apollon go to hell in 
a handbasket. Why the sudden erup- 
tion of paternal concern?” 

Charlton eyed the jester reflec- 
tively. “Well, I could say that it’s 
because the Empire loves you all, 
dear bright-eyed children, but I 
think I’ll be honest for a change.” 
He glanced at Arzur. “As you prob- 
ably know. Terra has been fight- 
ing an undeclared war for over six 
hundred years with an invisible em- 
pire known as the Sons of Night, or 
the Sons of Nyx as they are called 
in this sector. Tibis conflict is rapid- 
ly approaching a decisive stage. 
Apollon is located in a vital strate- 
gic area; the power that controls 
Apollon could well have a critical 
advantage.” He paused. “Terra does 
not want the Sons of Night to get 
Apoillon. She will do anything to 
prevent it.” 

“Then it is agreed.” Arzur said. 
“Terra will secretly help us to over- 
throw the government if we promise 
to apply for membership in the 
Olympian Protectorate when we are 
in power.” 

“It is agreed.” 

“Excellent. Now we must decide 
how this is to be brought about. 
Normally, I would let you discuss 
this with Jay; he has been handling 
cur local operations for the past 
few months. But he’s going off- 
planet tonight.” 

The jester grimaced. “The High 
Protector and the Oligarch of 
Hephaestus made a deal; His Holi- 
ness swapped me for an Aphroditian 



belly dancer. The Far Traveler for 
Hephaestus leaves Starport in a few 
hours, and I’ll have to be on it.” 

Hyman growiled, “What kind of 
help is Terra gonna send us? That’s 
what I want to know. Troops? 
Heavy weapons? Air support? What’s 
the Empire gonna give us?” 

“Me,” Charlton said. 

“What!” 

“I’m all the military aid you’re 
going to get. And you have no idea 
how generous the Empire is being 
to you at that.” 

“That’s mighty big talk, out- 
worlder,” Jvai spat. “But talk’s 
cheap.” 

“Oh, but I can do far more than 
just talk. I can prove my mettle 
and start your little revolution off 
with a bang if you can somehow 
smuggle me up to the High Citadel 
tonight. And the clown — ” he 
grinned savagely at Jay Benjamin — 
“can thank whatever gods he swears 
by that he’s not sleeping in the cita- 
del this night.” 

hariton was asked to step out 
into the hall while the rebel 
leaders debated what course of ac- 
tion to pursue. 

He waited. 

After a few minutes. Jay Benja- 
min sauntered from the room and 
crossed to where Charlton stood. 

“Have to be at Starport for pre- 
flight indoctrination so I’m leaving 
eariy,” the jester explained. He 
arched a sardonic eyebrow at the 
Earthman. “Patience, m’boy. Hy- 
man and Arzur are still deadlock^ 
over what to do with you. Hyman’s 
al/1 for quietly wrapping you in lead 




weights and dropping you in the 
nearest river, but I don’t think he’ll 
get his way.” He chuckled. “I’ve 
heard of you, Charlton, and I’ve 
known life under the Oligarchy 
also. Not everyone here is fooled by 
the propaganda. Some of us know 
how much liberty there is likely to 
be in a Terran liberation — and we 
don’t want the good comfortable life 
if its price is secret police and a 
knife in the dark. Some of us look 
beyond the arms of all-embracing 
Empire to the day when this will be 
the free Olympian Confederacy, and 
we will not be content merely to ex- 
change one set of masters with an- 
other. Think on that for a while, 
Charlton. Think well.” 

He slipped silently away. 

Charlton cursed. 

Moros finally broke the long si- 
lence that ensued, speaking more 
to himself than to Charlton. “There 
was a legend, Jhon, among your 
people many thousands of years ago 
that told of a mythical bein^ named 
Prometheus who stole preaous fire 
from heaven and gave it to man- 
kind. You could be a Prometheus, 
if you want to be. You could take 
fire back to the stars, spread the 
flame so that man could at long 
last be free of his own abominable 
stupidity. But you don’t want to; 



comes a problem of making you 
realize that there are more im- 
portant things in the universe than 
Jhon Charlton. Cutting you from 
all but a few chosen emotions was 
a good start, but it’s not enough, 
not nearly enough.” Had the alien 
been able to sigh, he would have 
then. “Mankind is on the brink of 
a tremendous, three-sided conflict: 
The Sons of Night versus the Ter- 
ran Empire with the rebehious colo- 
nists against both, and various hos- 
tile alien powers waiting to mop up 
whatever is left. You, Jhon, could 
be a focal point in that war; a war 
that could spell the end of galactic 
civilization. But you just don’t care, 
do you?” 

“No.” 

“Were I human, Jhon, I would be 
forced to call you a lousy bum.” 

They were interrupted as Arzur 
stepped into the hall and levelly at 
the Empty Man. “You’ll have your 
chance,” he said. “We’ll leave after 
midnight. Be ready.” He strode 
away, paused, and then swung 
around to face the Terran. “And 
Charlton,” he whispered softly, 
“you had better be as good as you 
say you are.”

THE EMPTY MAN

O utside, it was, if possible, even 
colder tihaii it had been earlier 
in the evening. Now a fierce wind 
blew from the north, biting aill pres- 
ent, except Charlton, to the bone 
in spite of fur-lined winter suits. 

The Empty Man glanced around 
him. They were far from the city, 
trying to work their way around 
through the uninhabited areas and 
approach the Citadel from the rear. 
For an hour, the ground had been 
sloping steadily upward until they 
found themselves in the foothills 
of the range of low mountains that 
surround^ the south end of High 
Delphi. They were climbing up a 
narrow and dangerous path that led 
across the face of a cliff. On the 
ri^t side rose a sheer wall of 
frowning granite, on the left was a 
dizzy drop of hundreds of feet. Far 
below, at the base of the cliff, twist- 
ed the tiny shining ribbon that was 
a mighty river. 

Charlton heaved a wistful sigh. 
In spite of the danger, it was a 
scene of great beauty and serenity. 

Moros shattered Charlton’s con- 
templation of the quiet. “If super- 
natural 'beings do indeed rule the 
universe, they purely must be Spirits 
of the Ironic. Life is a cosmic joke. 
The humor is grim, and we lowly 
mortals often fail to appreciate the 
jest, but wit is there if we search 
deep enough. Take yourself as a 
case in point. What marvelous irony I 
The greatest murder the galaxy has 
ever known; the man who very near- 
ly committ^ genocide yearns only 
for peace and serenity.” 



Chariton gritted his teeth and 
made la mighty effort to ignore the 
telepathic being. He concentrated 
instead on Vye’s slim, fur^rousered 
legs as she climbed up the trail 
ahead of him. In front of the girl 
toiled Sket Hyman, and leading the 
party was Denton Arzur, Vye’s 
lover. Last in line, gliding stealthily 
along behind Chariton, was the little 
killer, Jvai. 

Once again, Charlton’s trained 
mind probed out, straining to delve 
below the surface thoughts of his 
companions and explore the ego, 
the “I” factor, that lurked in the 
remoter regions of every brain. 
Slowly, he began to form a picture 
of the personality and motivations 
of each member of die party. A 
less hardened man would have been 
shocked at the pictures and memor- 
ies dredged up and fed into the 
scanning mind of the Empty Man. 

Beside idealism and the desire 
for material possessions, each had 
a mudvmore deeply rooted motiva- 
tion, a reason for hating the Pro- 
tector’s government. Vye’s reason 
was rape by a squad of Keres when 
she was a young girl, Arzur’s was 
the ibrutal slaughter of his parents, 
Hyman’s a life of misery and terror 
spent in a New Delphi slum watch- 
ing the government’s soldiers des- 
troying his property and friends. 

But Jvai was different. Certainly 
he hated the Keres, but it was the 
same twisted hatred the little killer 
felt for any living creature, male 
or female. Much more important, 
Jvai feared them. Chariton found 
one crystal-clear picture engraved 
indelibly in the killer’s brain.

IF 




Young Jvai, a boy about four, 
huddled in the gutter near the door 
of am incredibly dirty and broken- 
down shack in the seotkxn of the 
aty known as the Beggars’ Hole. 
He heard the blare of material music 
and as he glanced up, a squad of 
Kerw in full dress uniform paraded 
by. As toe boy watched toe Keres, 
the sunlight glinting dazzingly from 
their guns Md helmets, their bri^t 
ph^es tossing in toe wind, looking 
tall and shining, like gods, fear be- 
gan to fill his soul 



/Charlton s mind snapped back to 
the present. His hypersensitive 
ears had detected a faint sound, 
one that was out of place with the 
regular background drone of foot- 
falls and labored breathing. A back- 
ward glance, a movement too fast 
for the normal eye to see, confirmed 
his suspicions. The sound had been 
the rasp of a knife being cautiously 
slipped from a sheath. 

Jvai, the knife held dose to his 
body, stalked noiselessly toward 
Charlton, Undoubtably, he planned 





to push his victim’s ibody over the 
edge and claim it had been an acci- 
dent. 

The Empty Man smiled. Swiftly 
as a striking cobra, Jvai’s arm jerk- 
ed high into the air and then flash- 
ed forward. But not swiftly enough. 
A split second before, Charlton had 
broadcast the coded psionic signal 
that triggered the instantaneous 
molecular metamorphosis of his skin 
into a steePhard chitin substance. 
The knife drove into Charlton’s 
ribs. With a groan of tortured metal, 
the blade snapped in half. Charlton 
swung an arm like a wrecking boom. 
A terrified scream echoed through 
the predawn hush, and then Jvai 
was gone. Charlton caught a glimpse 
of him, only a tumbling, black spot, 
before he hit the surface of the 
river hundreds of feet below. 




“That was your traitor, Arzur,” 
he said as the rebel leader rushed 
to the spot. “Any chance of him 
surviving?” 

Hyman shook his head and spat 
contemptuously over the edge of 
the cliff. “If he survived the fall, 
the killerfish will cut him to rib- 



bons. Now, just how did you know 
he was the traitor?” 

“He tried to stab me but missed.” 
Hyman shook his head again, 
doubtfully this time. “Jvai never 
missed a stroke in his life.” 

“There’s always a first time.” 

V 

T he three rebels fled at break- 
neck speed down the winding 

trail. 

“I still don’t like it.” Hyman 
gasped. “What right did Charlton 
have to send us packing? What’s he 
up to, anyway? Maybe he’s a dou- 
ble agent.” 

“That’s the risk we’ll have to 
take.” Arzur snarled. “Run!” 
Hyman sighed resignedly and put 
on a burst of speed. Somewhat 
ahead of the others, he dashed 
around a curve in the trail and 
sprang back twice as quickly, 
twisting his body nearly double in 
mid-air with the violence of the mo- 
tion. “Keres,” he hissed. “We must 
have missed them on the way up.” 
“How many?” Arzur’s whisper 
was harsh. 

“Three.” 

“Did they spot you?” 

“I don’t thi^ so.” 

Vye ran her tongue nervously 
over dry lips. “What do we do 
now?” 

“Either die or get rid of them,” 
Arzur answered grimly. “But what- 
ever we do must be done quietly; 
noise would bring other guards down 
on our necks instantly.” He ges- 
tured for silence. In the sudden 
hush, they could hear the muffled

IF 




thud of boots on rocks approach- 
ing relentlessly closer up the trail. 
Vye slid a hand stealthily inside her 
warmsuit and drew forth a compact 
weapon that had been taped to her 
thigh. Hyman took up a position on 
the opposite side of the trail. 

They waited. 

Conversing in low tones, the three 
Keres rounded the corner. Vye’s 
airgun spat silent, but deadly, cya- 
nide darts. The needlebeam in Hy- 
man’s hand buzzed deeply once. The 
Keres jerked and then slumped nois- 
lessly into death. 

The Empty Man crouched in the 
shadow of a huge boulder. Ahead, 
situated on a plateau overlooking 
the panorama of High Delphi that 
stretched to the horizon far be- 
low, loomed the Citadel. He glanc- 
ed back along the trail; but by now, 
the rebels must be almost within 
sight of the city. He chuckled, re- 
membering the look on Arzur’s face 
when he had told them to run like 
hell. There had been a great deal 
of grumbling; but, they had obeyed 
him at last, which was fortunate. 
Soon the plateau would be hell. 

C harlton studied the immense is- 
land of man-made light in a sea 
of inky darkness and then glazed 
at the sky. For the last hour he 
had been calling for a storm, and he 
was going to get a whooper; great 
menacing thunderheads were billow- 
ing up from the north like a tidal 
w’ave. 

Rain began to spatter about him. 
This was the moment, the culmin- 
ation of his mission, the time of his 
personal triumph. And he felt noth- 



ing, not even a quiver of anticf- 
pation or exultation. He knew this 
his victory would turn to ashes in 
his mouth. 

Charlton reached out into the 
night. He directed all the inhuman 
energy he possessed into a task long 
considered impossible by science: 
channeling every iota of- electrical 
power in the immense storm into a 
single bolt, attempting to make all 
the electricity in the air ground it- 
self in the same spK)t at the same 
time. Impossible — but not for 
Jhon Charlton. 

In a moment, he would destroy 
a man he had never seen. And with 
the High Protector would die all 
■the hundreds of men, women and 
children that inhabited the Citadel. 
And they would never know what 
had killed them. 

Or why. 

“How does it feel to control the 
whirlwind, Jhon? To wield light- 
ning as a weapon and unleash it to 
kill whenever the divine whim takes 
you?” 

“Damn you!” Charlton’s scream 
was on the ragged edge of hysteria. 
“Shut up!” 

Lightning lashed from the sky 
like a two-pronged whip. 

The world exploded into fire. 

VI 

H yman bolstered his needier and 
turned to Arzur. Before any- 
one could speak, a sudden flash 
from behind turned night into blind- 
ing day. A microsecond later, the 
roar of the explosion burst upon 
them. The earth twisted sickening- 



THE EMPTY MAN

ly as if to a belly blow. An irresis- 
tible shock wave smashed them to 
the ground. 

The explosion was felt for miles. 
In High Delphi, people staggered in 



terror from their houses to gape 
toward the south, where a billow- 
ing cloud of smoke and huge, leap- 
ing tongues of flame shrouded the 
top of the Plateau of the Citadel. 





For the first time in Apollon’s his- 
tory, the Keres ceased their endless 
patrols of the city to stare upward 
in fear and awe, shoulder to shoul- 
der with ordinary citizens. From the 
Beggars* Hole, the rumor that the 
end of the world was at hand be- 
gan to spread like wildfire. In a 
few minutes, wails of fear and cries 
of delight at the Protector’s un- 
timely demise echoed through every 
street in the sprawling city. 

It took the trio of rebels nearly 
ten minutes to work up enough 
courage to climb back up the trail 
to the Citadel. They found the 
Empty Man standing alone in the 
center of an immense expanse of 
fused glass and metal that marked 
the site where the Citadel had once 
stood. He looked up slowly as they 
approached. It had been touch and 
go for a while, but the chitin armor 
of his transformed skin had success- 
fully protected him from the titanic 
stresses of . the blast. 

Hallelujah, thought Chaiilton bit- 
terly. 

And his companions stared at 
him in awe, he riffled swiftly 
through their brains, feeling a twinge 
of sour amusement at what he found. 
Hate and horror was strong in every 
mind. Arzur felt the most nausea; 
he was a much more idealistic man 
than the practical Hyman or any of 
the others. 

He would probably be found 
hanging from a rafter beam one 
day after he fully realized what 
he had visited on his people in the 
name of freedom. Chariton sighed. 
If things were different, if he wasn’t 
Charlton, he might have found a 



great friend in this man. 

His mouth curled into a hard, 
mirthless smile at the picture in 
Vye*s mind. 

Without a word, he led them 
from the field of victory. 

No one spoke during the long 
trip down the mountainside. They 
stumbled along mechanio^y, ob- 
livious to the gentle rain that sigh- 
ed around them like lover’s tears. 
The rebels were dazed by the way 
their world had 'been stood on its 
head without warning. All their most 
desired goals had been achieved 
overnight, and Arzur, for one, felt 
curiously lost. 

Chariton was wrapped in his own 
dark thoughts. He knew, of course, 
that his task was just beginning. In 
the morning, he must tackle a mul- 
titude of jobs: co-ordinating planet- 
wide efforts, whipping the under- 
ground forces into an efficient rebel 
army, planning military strategy, 
demoralizing the enemy, assassinat- 
ing, sabotaging and a million others. 
But now he wanted to rest; he was 
weary of body and of soul. 

They reached their headquarters 
without incident. The sound of 
rioting rang throughout the city, es- 
pecially in the area adjacent to the 
Beggars’ Hole, but it was unlikely 
that anyone would try to loot the 
shabby Beggars’ Union building. 
With a curt nod to Arzur, Charlton 
slouched wearily to his room and 
flung himself, fully dressed, down 
on the cot. 

C harlton had been asleep for less 
than a hour, and dawn was 
Just beginning to lighten the eastern

sky, when he sensed the presence 
of someone in the room. Instantly 
he snapped into full awareness, jyois- 
ed to kill. He smelt the delicate 
musk of perfume and saw starlight 
shimmer faintly from a frilly night- 
robe and untied raven hair that fell 
free to the shoulders. Something 
warm slid close to him on the cot. 

It was, of course, Vye. 

She leaned forward and pressed 
eager lips against his, muttering 
something low and unintelligible. 
For a moment, his body responded 
instinctively, but then the combin- 
ation of exhaustion, surprise, and de- 
sire surged over his groggy mind 
like an irresistible wave, and the last, 
frayed bond of mental control 
snapped under the strain. In one 
frightening instant, the boil had 
burst, the contamination spread, 
and he found himself staring straight 
into the depths of his own soul, 
seeing himself, REALLY seeing 
himself, for the first time, as others 
saw him — stripped of all self- 
delusions and conceits, every foible 
and fault standing out sharply un- 
der the harsh glaring light of reality. 

Horrified, he saw the real Jhon 
Charlton, in proper proportion to 
the universe at last: a pitiful, whin- 
ing, mewing thing of fragile flesh 
and blood, pathetically ignorant, 
weak and imperfect, yet possessed 
of such a* colossal vanity that it 
dared to cry its futile claims of 
superiority doud to an uncaring 
cosmos, a monkey chattering noisy, 
frightened defiance in the primeval 
darkness. Charlton had learned the 
hard way that the universe was not 
impressed by his existence, that life 



would flow along quite unchanged 
after the organic machine that was 
Charlton ceased to function. And, 
with a sick feeling in the pit of 
his stomach, HE KNEW. Roughly, 
he tore her arms loose from his 
neck and sprang to his feet. 

“Get out of here, damn you!” 

She, made a soft, hurt sound of 
surprise. “Why? Am I not pretty 
enough? Or perhaps a lowly colonial 
girl isn’t good enough for you, Ter- 
ran?” 

He shook his head, a jerky, des- 
perate motion. “No, it’s not that, 
but — I can’t. Now get out!” 

She rose to her feet and moved 
gently toward him, her eyes filled 
with compassion and tenderness. 
“What’s the matter?” she said softly. 

He shook his head again. He 
backed slowly away from her, and 
she followed. 

Her voice was as soft and gentle 
as a caress. Pinpoints of starlight 
danced magically in her eyes and 
reflected from her silken skin. 
“What’s the matter, darling? Tell 
me — please. I wartt to help you.” 

“I can’t.” His voice broke. He 
stumbled backwards. She stretched 
her hand beseechingly toward him. 

“I love you,” she whispered. “Let 
me help you.” He studied her out- 
stretched hand through a red fog. 
She moved closer, making soft lit- 
tle noises deep in the back of her 
throat. With a cracked scream, he 
whirled and hurled himself through 
the window. 

The ground leapt up to meet him 
with sickening speed. So, now I die, 
he thought and felt strangely grate- 
ful.

He smasihed into the bard pave- 
ment. 

And felt nothing. 




C harlton swore savagely. Again 
he had been beaten by a con- 
ditioned reflex. The chitin substance 
into which he had instinctively 
transformed his skin could insulate 
him against a far greater impact 
than a four-story drop. 

From behind him came a scream

and the sound of hysterical sob- 
bing. 

Charlton foimd himself running 
blindly ithrough the night. 

He knew that he must return in 
the morning. The conditioned sense 
of duty that was still too strong to 
disregard reminded him that he had 
a revoluition to engineer. Btit now 
he wanted only to run, run from 
himself, run on and on and on un- 
til the night swallowed him up with- 
out a trace — 

Now he knew what he had tried 
to hide from himself all these years. 

Lx)ve and hate are more than 
just opposites. One is the aibsence 
of the other; as black is the ab- 
sence of light, and cold the absence 
of heat, so is hate the absence of 
love. 

A man filled with hate and bit- 
terness has room for nothing else. 
Hatred, like some wasting disease, 
consumes the soul, growing and 
swelling until at last it turns and 
begins to feed upon itself. 

And he had always been a man 
of hate, a creature of death and 
destruction. 

“Why didn’t you make love to 
her, Jhon? The anatomy of your 
body would have been a problem, 
but not an insurmountable one. Not 
for you. Not for Jhon Charlton.” 

“I can’t,” he sobbed. “I can’t 
love!” 

“I know, you poor jerk,” Moros 
said gently. “You poor, poor jerk.” 

And a gust of sardonic mental 
laughter followed him from the 
square. END

He was being butchered to moke 
an alien holiday — but he could 
make them pay for their thrills! 



I 

T he noise from above was deaf- 
ening. Shouts, stomping of 
feet, cheers, I suppose, or the equi- 
valent of them. The equivalent of 
DHisic, too, if you could call it 
music. Something like the high, 
wailing strains of India, if you must 
have an Earth comparison. 

“What in the world’s going on?” 
Billy said nervously. 



“Search me,” I said. “It’ll be all 
right. Everything’s turned out all 
right, so far.” 

Billy looked at me. “Such as 
what?” 

I shrugged, trying to maintain a 
front. “Well, they finally figured 
out what we could eat and the fact 
that we needed what evidently 
seemed to them an unbelievable 
amount of water. They’re doing the 
best they can.” 



76 



Billy said 'bitterly, ‘We’ve been 
treated as prisoners, and you know 
it, Ken.” 

‘‘Don’t talk tbat way. We’ll be 
all rigjit.” 

We were in a small, unfurmsihed 
room. Possibly ten by ten. No win- 
dows. There was a narrow door 
through which we had been pushed 
possibly ten minutes earlier. There 
was a larger door, which evidently 
slid open and which took up the 
complete wall opposite our entry. 
You could hear 'the sounds through 
the large door as well as from 
above. 

“Ken?” 

“Yes?” 

“Something bad is about to hap- 
pen.” 

I swallowed. There was nothing 
I could do. Supposedly I was skip- 
per of this two^person expedition, 
but it was all out of my hands. The 
only help I could give poor Billy 
was verbal — and meaningless, as 
we both knew. 

I said, “It’ll be all right. Noth- 
ing else makes sense. There’s no 
point in anything happening to us. 
We’re, well, like ambassadors.” 

“Fine,” Billy said bitterly. “But 
do they know it?” 

I couldn’t think of anything very 
soothing to say. It was Billy’s first 
expedition, but with all the ex- 
periences behind me. I’d never got 
into anything like this. 

“Take it easy. Kid,” I said. 

Billy walked over toward the 
larger door and tried to find a crack 
in its edge, through which to peer. 

As though that movement had 
triggered something, a sheet of 



metal blurred up from below, be- 
tween us, bisecting the room, cut- 
ting it exactly in half, Billy on one 
side, 1 on the otheir. 

It came with such speed, I was 
caugjbt completely unaware. It took 
me long seconds to comprehend. 
Then I banged against it, hard, des- 
perately. 

“Billy!” I yelled. 

“Ken!” I could hear the voice, 
dimly, through the metallic sheet. 
It was high. Shrill! 

I banged with my fists. “Billy! 
Billy!” 

But there was no answer now. 

In a moment, the metal wall 
which had divided us sank back 
into the floor, more slowly than it 
had risen. I knew, inside I knew, 
that Billy wasn’t going to be there. 
I was alone in the ten-by-ten com- 
partment. 

There was nothing to do but stare 
at the now dosed portal through 
which my companion must have 
gone. 

Above, the shouts and cheers 
doubled in volume. The music swell- 
ed to an unbearable crescendo. 1 
sank down to the floor and put my 
head in my hands. 

T he noise swelled and fell. There 
would be great mob shouts, 
screams from what was obviously 
excitement and sometimes a great 
drumming of feet — hooves would 
be better the term. It was evidently 
some type of applause. 

Then there was the music. At 
times it would break into a great 
shrilling, usually contemporaneous 
with the swelling shouts. Th^ it

would fade away until a new period 
of excitement. 

I came to my feet ifinally and 
made a great to do studying my 
cell. Not that there was anything 
to find. The whole compartment 
was of metal, doors and all. Even 
had I tools, I would have had my 
work cut out getting through either 
entry. And I had no tools. I had 
nothing. 

I was clad in the simplest of 
cloths around my loins, the equiv- 
alent of very brief men’s swimming 
trunks. Billy had been dressed the 
same. They had taken our clothes, 
inoluding shoes, the first day, and 
since that time we had been in the 
nude save for the strips of tex- 
tile. Actually, it fitted the climate 
wihich was as dry as Death Valley 
and almost as hot. 

Fifteen minutes must have passed, 
though I had no way of marking 
time. 

A hush fell. For the first time 
since Billy and I had been con- 
ducted to this tiny prison there was 
no pK)unding of feet, no shouting 
of excitement. If anything, it was 
the more ominous. 

I pressed nearer to the large por- 
tal through which Billy must have 
gone. Gone to what? 

To my surprise, it slid very slight- 
ly to one side. By applying my right 
eye, I could observe, with difficulty, 
a narrow arc of what was beyond. 
^ Beyond was a stretch of sand, 
leading to a wooden fence, possibly 
six feet or so high. Above the fence 
I could make out tier upon tier of 
the Centaurs. And now they were 
shouting and screaming again. 



But this impression was formed 
at the back of my mind. My atten- 
tion was focused in horror to a 
point halfway between where I 
stood peering and the fence beyond. 
There in the sand was Billy, his 
body ^bearing a score of gaily rib- 
boned darts. 

And to one side, only a couple of 
feet away, stood one of them, har- 
nesses in red, a short swordlike 
thing held high in one of its stub- 
by airmlike appendages. 

Controlling my nausea, my urge 
to retch, I couldn’t tear my eyes 
away from the slit. The Centaur 
pranced about, facing this direc- 
tion, that. Saluting the now roaring 
crowd, bowing, prancing. 

And then four more of the crea- 
tures, these in plain brown harness, 
came trotting forth. In quick, effi- 
cient movements a lariat was trussed 
around Billy’s feet, and the 'body 
was dragged briskly away, beyond 
my small arc of vision. 

The crowds in the stands roared 
again. The red-clad Centaur saluted 
again with his ridiculous toy sword. 

And suddenly, the door against 
which I leaned, peering through the 
crack in my horror, shot aside, com- 
pletely open. I stumbled, then 
caught myself. 

And I could make out in full 
now what had been only a frac- 
tion through my aperture. 

The sand floored arena was 
possibly fifty-five yards across and 
surrounded by a wooden barrier, 
yes, about six feet high, using my- 
self as a measure. I am six feet 
tall, about one eighty in weight. 

Above the barrier, immediately,

were two rows of, well, we would 
call them seats. They were more 
like couches the Greeks and Rom- 
ans once used at table. Billy and 
I had already found them to be the 
nearest thing to a seating arrange- 
ment the Centaurs provided them- 
selves, and that seldom enough. 
They usually preferred to stand. 
Largely, the couches seemed a pres- 
tige item, a status symibol. 

Beyond -the two tiers of couches 
was tier upon tier of standing Cen- 
taurs, reaching up to a point where 
it seemed unlikely the multitude 
could see what was going on below 
in any detail. In short, it was a 
tremendous stadium. 

A H this has taken time to des- 
cribe, it took no time to assi- 
milate. My real attention was riveted 
to a small sword stuck in the sand 
not more than ten feet beyond where 
I stood. 

When the door had opened, re- 
vealing me to the multitude, a shout 
had gone up. The music shrilled to 
a crescendo again. 

I looked up into the stands, in 
all my hate and bitterness. 

And it was then that a flash of 
pain struck me in my left shoulder 
blade. I reeled forward, caught my- 
self. I shot a look 'behind. There 
was a small, ydllow beribboned dart 
in my back. And the entry door be- 
hind me was closed again. 

With a roar of anger, I grabbed 
up the sword, spun around looking 
for the foe. 

But the arena was empty. Billy 
was ' gone. The red-hamess^ Cen- 
taur, gone. For now I was alone. 



ARENA 




I shook the Made up at the 
stands, screaming my hate at them. 
And they roared hack at me. 1 had 
no idea if they have the concep- 
tion of humor, or, if they have, if 
some of the sounds they were now 
ma-king expressed it. 

I reach^ my hand around to 
the irritating dart. I could feel 
a trickle of blood running down 
my hack from the wound. I tried 
to pull it out, hut then the pain 
intensified. The damned thing must 
be barbed, like a fishhook is barb- 
ed. I let it stay. 

A door opened on the arena’s 
far side, and three of the Cen- 
taurs came trotting in: one in yel- 
low harness, one in blue, and fi- 
nally the one in red. The rage swelled 
up within me! 

II 

C entaur is obviously not the word. 

It came immediateily to mind 
when Billy and I first saw them. 
They are about the size of a small 
Earth-side burro. I would say in 
total weight they would average 
about the same as a man. How- 
ever, the neck is somewhat longer 
than that of the usual Earth quad- 
ruped. No, I reserve that, we have 
of course not only the camel but 
even the giraffe. The neck, in ac- 
tuality, was about the length of 
that of a Peruvian llama. The great 
di^erence was the two arm4ike ap- 
pendages, and it was these that 
branded them centaurs in our eyes. 
It took little imagination to com- 
paie them to the Greek mythic 
creatures with the bodies of the 



horse and the human upper torso. 

The two appendages at the side 
of the neck, just above the fore- 
shoulders, were not as effident as 
a man’s arms, nor were the four- 
fingered hands as dexterous. But 
evidently they had been enough 
to bring this life form to the as- 
cendary on their planet. 

Now, as I stood there, the three, 
in the unison of chorus giris, pranc- 
ed into a line, dashed in a gallop 
to a point immediately before what 
could only have been the presi- 
dent’s box, the king’s stand — what- 
ever their officialdom might be. It 
was luxurious beyond anything I 
had thus far seen on this grim 
world, and no more than a half 
dozen reclining Centaurs occupied 
the robe-'bedecked couches. 

The music shrilled high, as the 
threb skidded to a halt in a swirl 
of sand and saluted the officials. 

But I’d had enough. 

All my life, I have read the ex- 
pression /le saw red. It never came 
through to me. A bit too precious. 
Not quite true. But now I knew the 
original writer of what eventually 
became a cliche in the Earth-Basic 
language wrote from experience. 

Because now I saw red. All was 
a red haze. 

I rushed them. 

For moments, I felt a surge of 
confidence, since they obviously 
didn’t see my approach. Sword in 
hand I ran, plowing through the 
sand. And they ignored me, pranc- 
ing, capering, bowing and salut- 
ing to the cheering mob of their fel- 
lows. 

The nearest was the one in the

blue harness. As I came nearer, I 
could make out his outfit in more 
detail. His hands were free, but 
to one side he wore a scabbard 
which undoubtedly housed a sword 
similar to my own and similar to 
the weapon the red-costumed one 
had evidently used to finish off Billy. 

The harness had some aspects, I 
could see, of body armor, since it 
covered what were obviously the 
more vital parts, and there seemed 
to be some sort of bandoleer criss- 
crossing the neck — or chest, if 
you wish to retain the centaur im- 
age — something like Pancho Vil- 
la’s Mexican soldiers you see in 
the historical Tri-Di shows. 

I was almost to them, coming up 
from the rear. I swung my sword 
high, feeling no compunction what- 
soever at attacking without warn- 
ing. Feeling nothing except rage 
beyond the point I had thought pos- 
sible. 

I must have missed my aim by 
several feet. 

In a sudden burst of motion, the 
three of them had scampered off 
in as many directions, and 1 was left 
standing there, sword again on high, 
stupidly. 

The mob’s voice reached to the 
skies. 

And, yes, their race knew humor. 
If this you cojLild call humor. They 
also knew ridicule. 

From the sides of my eyes, I 
caught Yellow coming in fast. I 
tried to spin, tried to backhand 
him with tihe sword. 

He was in, his body actually 
scraping me for a moment, and 
then out again. 



I was almost dashed to the sand. 

I caught myself, came alert once 
more. I could feel another sting, 
this time near my right shouidec 
blade. My eyes went there, inadvert- 
ently. There was anotner ribboned 
dart. In a moment the pain became 
more intense. In my rage, I had 
forgotten the first dart, now I re- 
membered. 

Both wounds were ’ now bleeding 
— each but a trickle. 

Blue was coming in from the other 
side in a burst of speed. I turned 
and faced him, the sword always 
ready. 

He came close, a dart, blue rib- 
boned, in one of his hands. Their 
arms were not of the length, nor 
strength to give them the power 
for a good throw. They would 
never had made javelin men. But 
enough darts, no matter how small, 
will bring down a buffalo — m 
time. 

He hadn’t coordinated his attack 
sufficiently. At the last moment, 
seeing me ready, he skidded into a 
turn, throwing the dart, starting 
away. I dashed forward and swung 
at him. I know nothing about 
swordsmanship; even at the personal 
combat school in Neuve, San Diego, 
they never teach it any more. It is 
no longer even a sport on Earth. 
However, in this type of action, 
swordsmanship was not of the es- 
sence, quickness of hand was. 

I slugged him a good one, across 
what would be called the haunch, 
had he been actually of the Equidae 
family. But he darted otff, as 
untouched. I had expect^ to finish 
him.

I looked uncomprehendingly at 
die sword, accusingly, and learned 
my first bard lesson. It was a mean- 
ingless weapon. I would have been 
hard put to cut cheese with it. It 
was about as sharp as the average 
letter opener, and not even the point 
was really adequate. I could, possi- 
bly, draw blood with the point, but 
it was going to be a rare situation 
under which my weapon could 
cause any considerable damage. The 
cards were stacked against me even 
beyond the point it must have look- 
ed in the stands. 

But Blue had missed me with his 
dart. I waded through the sand 
and picked it up and even as I 
stooped I sensed the rush, heard the 
swirl of sands as one of them turned 
quickly and felt another of the 
barbed missiles penetrate my thigh. 

I scurried over to the wood bar- 
rier which surrounded the arena, 
fear suddenly welling up from in- 
side to replace the rage of a mo- 
ment earlier. I had three darts in 
me now, each wound bleeding, 
though none badly. Still, how many 
could one take? 

I held the blue dart in my right 
hand, my all but useless sword in 
my left. I got my back to the wood- 
en wall. 

All right, you four--l egged bums, 
come in and get me. I felt myself 
breathing hard, in spite of the fact 
that no more than two or three 
minutes could have transpired since 
I had entered the ring. Breathing 
hard and blistering with sweat. 

I might have known they were 
old pros at this. In their time, with- 
out doubt, they had worked out 



every variation on the theme possi- 
ble. 

All three came In at a gallop. 
Red along one barrier wall. Blue 
along the other. Yellow directly at 
me from the middle of the arena. 
I stood there, feet wide, braced. If 
nothing else, I thought wildly, if 
I could get my hands on one of 
them during the melee to come, I 
could strangle him. They were no 
larger than I and no stronger, I was 
sure. 

Billyy Billy, I muttered meaning- 
lessly. Give me the strength and 
chance to finish just one. 

It looked as though they were 
bent on collision — that we would 
wind up in a free-for-all pile. I 
threw my dart at Blue, tried to use 
the point of my sword against Red. 

Blue had his sword in hand. With 
a flick of wrist, an amazing dexteri- 
ty, he fended the dart off, the same 
moment coming to his hind hooves, 
spinning and dashing off again. At 
the same split moment. Red had 
done the same. 

Yellow was alone, before me. 
Back on his rear legs he went, and 
his hand blurred. I felt the now fam- 
iliar pierce of one of the darts. His 
hand flicked to his chest, plucked 
another dart from his bandoleer, 
blurred again. All this time, he was 
reared back, dramatically. I felt the 
second dart strike a rib and fall 
away, leaving a bleeding red groove. 

Ill 

T he crowd screamed its pure joy. 

Enraged again, I dashed after 
him as he beat his retreat. 



82 



IF 




I came to a halt in the center of 
the ring. I could never catch him 
in a race. I stood there blowing. I 
had four of the darts in me now. The 
rage was gone again. Even Billy was 
forgotten. It was fear that held me 
now. I knew I was to die in this ring. 
I could smell the fear stink in my 
sweat. 

They were making a tour of the 
arena, galloping along in unison now. 
Yellow leading. The crowd roaring. 
Evidently, they had come to the end 
of one part of the drama. A new 
one was to commence. 

I shook my head to dash perspira- 
tion from my eyes. And it came to 
me that thus far I had played the 
fool. Here I was, homo sapien, the 
thinking animal, trying to make like 
a lion, a tiger ... or a bull. 

Yes, a bull. The similarity to this 
situation and that of the bull in the 
fiesta brava of the old days in Spain 
and Mexico was inescapable. I had 
seen the spectacle various times in 
Tri-Di shows and historical. 

It wasn’t as fantastic as all that, 
I realized, even as I stood trying to 
catch my breath and overcome my 
fear, in preparation for the next act 
of the show. Given a culture that 
evolved gladiatorial fights, a warrior 
race with the love of combat, and 
inevitably as the culture became 
decadent, the fights in the arena 
would take a definite trend: an au- 
dience, seeing a victim killed vicari- 
ously, and shouting, cheering its ex- 
citement. The popular gladiator, or 
matador. A judge in the stands, some 
high official to preside and be salut- 
ed. A good deal of pageantry and 
colorful gobbledygook. A definite 



routine, always followed. And, 
eventually, the deck so stacked that 
although it looked dangerous indeed, 
the victim never had a chance of 
winning. 

The bull might look ever so large. 
The matador pathetically small and 
helpless, so straight, noble and fine 
in his trajes de luces, his suif of 
lights. But the bull never won, was 
never meant to win. In ’his day a 
name matador might kill two thou- 
sand bulls and more and then, in 
his own time, die in bed. Percentage- 
wise, the bull had no chance whatso- 
ever. No matter how dangerous the 
show might be rigged to seem,, the 
matador was always victorious. 

I remembered the Tri-Di I had 
seen based on the life of Manolete, 
possibly the greatest torero of the 
20th Century. Upset by personal 
woes, the man had finally come in- 
to the ring sodden drunk and had 
paid the penalty. But he had been 
the last, the last of the great mata- 
dors ever to die in the arena. From 
then on the clipping of horns, the 
drugging of the animals, the reduc- 
tion in size and fierceness of the 
Bos taurus ibericus had made the 
spectacular about as dangerous as 
riding to hounds. 

It came to me suddenly what was 
going on. Something like the Span- 
ish bullfight of old, the killing of the 
victim was divided into definite acts. 
The initial running of the bull, to 
get an idea of its speed, the way it 
hooked, what horn it favored. Then 
the picadors, to keep it enraged and 
to bring down its head a bit, then 
the banderillas to enrage it still fur- 
ther and keep it coming, then the 



ARENA 



83 




final faena where the matador put 
on his performance, leading to the 
moment of truth. 

In the same manner, my Centaurs 
were going into a new act of the 
show. And I thought I knew what it 
might be. They realized that at this 
point I was terrified and temporarily 
exhausted. They were giving me a 
rest. A chance to collect myself. 
Then they “were going to come in 
again, enrage me again, until I 
stupidly charged through the sands, 
slugging after them, while they posed 
and pranced, gracefully making a 
fool out of me for the edification of 
the cheering mob. 

It was what happened to the bull. 
They kept him enraged, kept him 
coming, kept him from stopping long 
enough to figure out that it wasn’t 
the cape but the man behind it that 
counted. 

All right. I was homo sapien, the 
thinking animal. Start thinking, 
Ken, start thinking. And not about 
Billy. Not about the fact that you’re 
never going to leave this ring alive. 
Not about the fact that a mere 
month ago you were Kenneth 
Ackerman, most promising young of- 
ficer in the Space Exploration Corps, 
happily married, a semi-celebrity 
back home, due to your deeds of 
derring-do. Start thinking instead, of 
taking a couple of them along with 
you. Or, at the very least, one. If 
nothing else, for Billy and the way 
Billy’s body had looked, crumpled 
there on the sands, a score of darts 
with their pretty ribbons embedded 
in the body from every angle. You 
can do it, somehow. 

Start thinking. 



I breathed deeply. All right, what 
is there to think about? What 
could a bull have thought about, 
other than what he did? 

Something came to me. I had 
seen Red taking the plaudits of the 
crowd, lifting his little sword to the 
salute, as he stood over Billy’s 
corpse. But it wasn’t Red that was 
giving me most of my hard time, 
now. In fact, I didn’t have a red 
dart in me. All were yellow. 

Yellow was obviously ttie mata- 
dor, this time. Red and Blue were 
running interference for him. Red 
had been the matador, the most im- 
portant performer, with Billy, but 
Yellow was my prime enemy. 

All right. Point one. I’d learned 
something. It might help. 

Something else. They’d stacked the 
deck with the sword they gave me. 
In the same manner as when they 
had trimmed a bull’s horns, in the 
fiesta brava, they stacked the cards 
against him. A bull cannot see the 
tips of its horns. All its life it learns 
where they ^re through practice; just 
how to hook. But with a few inches 
trimmed down, he’s thrown off his 
perspective; and before he learns to 
correct his aim, the torero has made 
an ass of the bull, and he’s dead. 

So it was with me. They had given 
me a sword that was all but useless. 
I was continuing, in the heat of the 
fight, to try to utilize it. Their 
swords, I could be sure, were sharp 
enough. But mine was a delusion. 

Should I throw it away entirely 
and depend on bare hands? 

But then something came to me, 
and I stared down at the pseudo- 
weapon in my hand. In actuality, it 



84 



IF 




bore only a superficial resemblance 
to what we would think of as a 
sword on Earth, being only a bit 
more than a foot in length and hav- 
ing no cross piece to guard the hand. 
The hilt, though undoubtedly of 
sufficient size for the small grip 
of the Centaurs, was inadequate for 
a man as large as I. It was a toy 
sword, aside from being blunt of 
edge. 

But it was all I had. 

Think, Ken Ackerman. Think, 
homo sapien. Think, you ambassa- 
dor of good will to an alien intelli- 
gence. Think! 

The roar of the mob reached to 
the skies again. 

The three of them were coming 
in at a graceful trot, slowly gaining 
speed. Yellow was in the center, 
sword in hand, Red to one side. Blue 
to the other. Both of the flankers 
bore darts in their hands. 

Back to me came two scenes. One, 
a performer in a Tri-Di revival of 
the vaudeville of yesteryear. One, in 
which I myself starred in the school- 
yards of my youth, at a boy’s game 
come down through the ages. Could 
I combine the two? 

On they came, Red and Blue, now, 
slightly ahead. 

I thought I cou\d see the strategy. 
With their darts, they would fade in 
initially, drawing my attention. Yel- 
low, my matador, would dash in 
then for some undoubtedly graceful 
bit of daring which would bring the 
plaudits of the mob, the shrilling of 
the congratulatory music. 

“All right,” I growled. “Meet the 
mumbly peg champ of Public Gram- 
mar School Number Six!” 



I flicked my tiny sword over, 
grasping the point, and shuffled for- 
ward, ignoring the incoming Red 
and Blue. 

Their eyes, large and multipupiled, 
had no discernible lids, so far as 
Billy and I had made out earlier. 
But now those of Yellow widened, 
and he skidded to a halt and reared 
to his hind legs preparatory to dash- 
ing off. 

I could feel the darts strike deep 
in both sides and ignored them. At 
the moment, I could have ignored 
the slugs of a 9mm mini-Bazooka. 

I dredged up the skill of two 
decades past and threw, not particu- 
larly hard but with all the accuracy 
I could call upon. 

The point struck at the spot which 
would have housed the human 
larnyx. 

Eyes bugging like a tarsier. Yel- 
low dropped from his rearing posi- 
tion, fell to his front feet, fell to 
his front ^knees, his small hand drop- 
ping his own sword. 

I heard snorts of dismay from 
either side and the swishing of sand 
as Red and Blue came hurrying in 
to the rescue. I ignored them still. 

I waded forward, through the 
sands, stooped, swept up the 
sword. I didn’t bother to check, even 
with my eyes, the keenness of blade. 
I knew, as I knew my life, that it 
would be as razor sharp as my own 
had been dull. I spun and slashed 
with all the strength of my man arm, 
with all the strength of a maniac. 
And ripped a cut from the withers 
of Blue to the strifle of his left leg, 
a cut that must have delved halfway 



ARENA 



85 




through his girth. So that even as I 
spun to locate Red, the evil horror 
of Blue’s viscera began to spill out, 
and his scream could have been that 
of the pony his hind quarters re- 
sembled. 

R ed was in full retreat, dashing 
for the entry portal through 
which he and the other two had 
galloped so gracefully hardly ten 
minutes before. And as he ran, he 
stumbled, regained his feet, dashed, 
skidded in the sands so that he near- 
ly fell again. 

And I plodded after. This was the 
one who had finished Billy. This was 
the one who had taken the applause 
from the screaming crowd, after giv- 
ing Billy the coup de grace. 

He dropped his sword, made the 
gate, began beating on it with his 
tiny, ineffective hands and shrilling. 

And it came to me how basic 
in all higher life forms are the fun- 
damental reactions — among others, 
pleasure and pain, rage and ecstasy 
. and terror. 

Beyond the gate must have been 
consternation. And deep within me 
I hoped that the reason it budged not 
was because those on the other side 
also felt that terror of unexpected 
extinction from a victim who was 
meant to receive the blessing of 
death, not award it. 

Still beating on the portal, he 
darted his head around to watch my 
progress through the sands. Had he 
left off then and dashed for it, I 
could never have caught him. My 
physical resources were all but ex- 
hausted, and I was being kept going 
by hate alone. 



But there was nothing left in him 
at all, save his terror. 

I came up from behind and cut 
his hamstrings, each with a double 
blow so that whatever the degree of 
their surgery, he would be forever a 
cripple. 

Then I turned and walked slow- 
ly back and came before the pres- 
ident’s box. And it came to me that 
for the past several minutes, the 
minutes of slaughter, there had been 
silence throughout that stadium of 
thousands. The music had withered 
away, the shouting was gone, not a 
hoof tramped the flooring. 

And I stood there before the re- 
clining aristocracy of the Centaurs 
and recalled the stance of Red as 
he had stood over the fallen body 
of Billy. And to the extent that I 
could on my two legs, repeated the 
salute he had made. I held my sword, 
just so. I flourished it, just so. I 
bowed and saluted again, as Red had 
bowed and saluted. 

Then I turned on my heel and 
saluted that quarter of the arena, 
the thousands of Centaur vicarious 
bravos, and then to that quarter, and 
that and that. Till each in all that 
vast audience had been properly 
saluted. 

And in all that stadium I could 
make out but two sounds. One, the 
last involuntary kickings of Blue, in 
his death throes in the center of the 
arena. Two, the continuing terrified 
shrilling of Red, who had fallen to 
the sands. 

But at last the gate had opened, 
and a dozen or more brown^harness- 
ed ring attendants came scurrying 
through. Half of them gathered 



86 



IF 




about the fallen Red, jostling each 
other in their attempts to raise him 
and carry him away. 

The others, six or eight, came 
running toward me. Running, but 
at no great speed. And as they came 
they spread out. Some bore long, 
thin lances, and some, lariats. 

I saluted the president’s box, once 
more, tossed my sword to the sands 
and turned and folded my arms and 
awaited them. 

IV 

I t was five or six days before they 
brought me before his high 
mucky-muck. I never did discover 
his title, nor his manner of achieving 
office. He might have been an elected 
official, a hereditary emperor. He 
might have been the equivalent of a 
bishop, for that matter. I never dis- 
covered their socioeconomic system 
and certainly had no interest. 

They had hospitalized me and, to 
the extent they could with an alien 
life form, tended my wounds. They 
fed me — after I at last found the 
determination to eat again — the 
foods they had discovered by hit and 
miss that Billy and I could assim- 
ilate. 

When at 4ast they came for me, 
they brought the clothes I had worn 
when we had been captured upon 
emerging from the Space Scout. 

There were four of them, the first 
Centaurs I had seen since the arena, 
save my doctors, nurses or whatever 
they were who had cared for me. At 
the time I had thought of them as 
jailers. 

The four were harnessed as elabo- 



rately as any I had as yet met. And 
though I had little interest now, in 
what I observed, it came to me again 
how many peculiarities our life 
forms had in common. For they 
decorated their harnesses with gems, 
as our aristocracy of the past once 
did. 

They stood politely, while I 
donned my space gear. I had no par- 
ticular interest in so doing, in fact, 
it was overly hot. But then, I had 
no particular reason not to, and it 
seemed to be their expectation. I 
was satisfied to go along until I 
found my opening. 

I finally went with them, two be- 
fore me, two behind. And when we 
left the — ril call it hospital — an- 
other small troop fell in behind. 

Once again, their buildings are 
surprisingly similar to our own, save 
they are done on a larger and less 
decorative scale. I don’t know why, 
but to mind came the palaces and 
temples of the ancient Babylonians 
or Assyrians. Great massive buildings 
with long halls and corridors. There 
were ramps, rather than stairs, for 
obvious reasons. One temple we 
passed could have been a ziggurat 
direct from Sumer. 

When we entered the great build- 
ing, be it a palace, presidential resi- 
dence, or senate building, another 
guard came to the salute. 

I grunted self-deprecation. The 
ambassador from Earth’s confedera- 
tion was at long last being treated 
with correct protocol. 

W e proceeded down long halls 
again and finally to a large 
reception room. At the far end, re- 



ARENA 



87 





clining on the only couch with which 
the room was furnished, was the 
largest of the Centaurs with whom 
1 had thus far come in contact. Al- 
though there were a double score of 
elaborately harnessed ones present, 
he wore the simplest attire of all. It 
was black, without ornamentation 
and well worn. I gained the impres- 
sion that it was battle dress which 
had seen many a campaign and was 
thus more prestigious than the gems 
and colorful dress of his associates. 

The king, the emperor, the presi- 
dent, the warchief, the bishop? As I 
said before, I didn’t know, nor care. 

My guard of honor, or whatever 
they were, peeled away and stationed 
themselves at a discreet distance 
amongst the other retainers. I stood 
alone before his high mucky-muck. 

I found to my surprise that I was 
still capable of surprise. 

Because he opened his mouth and 
said in very passable Earth-Basic, 
“A great mistake has been made.” 

I looked at him for a long mo- 
ment. I felt too empty to reply. 
Nothing came. 

His large, inhuman eyes went to 
his retainers on one side of the hall 
and then the other, in a very human 
expression. As though he was asking 
for assistance in his approach. But 
beyond a slight shuffling of hooves, 
there was nothing. 

He said, “You are not surprised 
that I speak your tongue? I have 
gone to considerable effort.” 

“I am surprised,” I said heavily. 

He said, “It was not so difficult 
as you might think. From the mo- 
ment you were placed in your . 
quarters, here, we recorded each 



88 



IF 




sound you made. Our technicians 
were able to decipher your means of 
communication, particularly since it 
resembles our own to such an amaz- 
ing extent, that is, the creating of in- 
dividual sounds and the reception of 
them.” 

Nothing came to me to say. 

He stirred slightly on his couch. 
I suspected again that the Centaurs 
were more comfortable standing, that 
the couches had to do with ritual and 
rank. Not that I cared. 

He said, “We realize now that 
you are not a member of an inferior, 
unintelligent species, but are actual- 
ly the dominant life form of your 
planet . .” 

“Planets,” I said emptily. “Our 
race dominates nearly three thou- 
sand, in all.” 

A change came over his expres- 
sion, possibly of dismay. Their fea- 
tures are not similar enough to our 
own to read. 

After a time, he said, “On our 
world, there is an inferior species, 
similar to yours. That is, they are 
bipeds. You will understand that it 
is possible for such a species to be 
repugnant to us. Surely there are life 
forms on your own home planet that 
are repugnant to you.” 

“Yes,” I ,said. “Reptiles. Four- 
legged reptiles.” 

He stiffened. Another characteris- 
tic we evidently had in common. 

He said finally, “In analyzing the 
recordings we made between you and 
your comrade, we now realize that 
you were in '.fact a mission. Could 
you describe it in more detail?” 

I took a breath. “The custom of 
our confederation of planets is to 



send an exploratory expedition to 
any newly discovered worlds which 
might possibly support our life form. 
The first expedition is small and pre- 
liminary.” 

“And what is its purpose?” 

“Chiefly to discover whether or 
not there is an intelligent life form 
already occupying the new worid.” 

His unnaturally large eyes remain- 
ed on me, waiting. 

I said, “If it is decided that the 
life form is compatible, it becomes a 
fringe world of our system with 
which we trade and exchange data.” 
I halted there. 

He broke the silence. “And if it is 
inimical?” 

They had studied our language to 
the point of having such terms as 
inimical in their vocabulary. Ob- 
viously, their concern was not small. 
I held my peace. 

Behind me, the assembled Cen- 
taurs stirred restlessly. 

He said finally, “A great mistake 
has been made, and we are anxious 
to make reparations. Reparations a 
hundred times over. We wish you, 
Kenneth Ackerman, to return to 
your confederation and assure your 
authorities that the planet of Xeno- 
peven wishes to become a, as you 
said, fringe world of your confedera- 
tion.” 

I shook my head at him, a ges- 
ture that was probably meaningless. 

“There is one great difficulty. I 
see you know my name. Do you 
know that of my late companion?” 

“Billy Ackerman. We are greatly 
disturbed . .” 

“Among our species, the female 
takes the name of the male upon 



ARENA 



89 




becoming bis wife,” I said emptily. 
“Female?” he said. “Wife?” 

They were not nearly so like our 
own life form as some of the sur- 
face similarities would suggest. 

“I do not understand,” he said. 
“But with such great issues at stake, 
surely this admitted mistake can be 
negotiated . .” 

I t was then that f bounded at him. 
It took three full strides. 

I knew I had but seconds. But 
seconds, pray to all the powers in 
which I have never truly believed, 
would be enough. 

Such anachronisms as swords, we 
had received no training in at the 
personal combat school in Neuve, 
San Diego. But hand-to-hand combat 
was another thing. Judo, jujitsu, 
karate, kushti and all the other di- 
verse methods of man killing man 
or beast with his bare hands are 
taught, in fact, are going through a 
long mode, a fad — the end, of 
course, the building up of our phys- 
ical bodies. 

His unnatural, reclining posture 
on the couch prevented him from 
making more than a preliminary 
movement before I was upon him. 
My hands were choppers. He could 
not know it, but since returning from 
the arena to my hospital room, I 
had devoted my time, as much as I 
could find, to pounding, toughening 
the sides of my hands. I hadn’t had 
the days I required, but it would 
have to suffice. 

The Centaurs, as I have said, 
weighed perhaps the same as « man, 
and this chief among them, perhaps 
rather more. But their build is such. 



with their six limbs and lengthy 
torso-necks giving them the cen- 
tauran appearance, that the bodies 
are comparatively slight. And so I 
found this one. 

Before they overwhelmed me, I 
had cracked the neck at least twice, 
smashed a dozen other bones. My 
spaceboots helped, they were a far 
cry from my being barefooted out 
there in the arena. 

T hey have me now in a smallish, 
well secured room. But it isn’t 
uncomfortable, given their standards. 
Nor have they in any way lessened 
the quality nor quantity of my food 
and rink. To the contrary. The way 
I figure it, they’re in a tizzy. 

They have no manner of know- 
ing what the Confederation does if 
one of its scouting ships turns up 
missing. For all they know, the whole 
fleet comes calling, the battle fleet 
of a race that has populated 3000 
worlds, with all the blood, sweat, 
and tears that would entail. 

They don’t know either what 
would happen if they turned me 
loose, restored my Space Scout and 
let me return. They have no way of 
knowing, if I, as an individual, could 
sway the human authorities to brand 
Xenopeven an inimical world. They 
don’t know what to do with me. 

Meanwhile, I’m continuing to 
practice my chopping, the hardening 
of the edges of my hands. They’re 
awfully careful not to get too close 
to me, but you never know. 

Billy wasn’t the vindictive kind, 
she wouldn’t have approved. 

Still in all. I’d like to get just one 
more of them. END

HOW TO LIVE 
LIKE A SLAN 

by LIN CARTER 

Our Man in Fandom fakes 
us to where the Slans live! 



Neologistically Speaking 

A S a group, science-fiction fans 
are rather fond of neolo- 
gisms. That seven-dollar word is not 
meant to scare you. It just means 
that they enjoy coining new words 
and terms. The fans like to give 
names to everything they are in- 
volved with -p- conventions, clubs, 
magazines, each other — and even 
things like their own cars, t)rpe- 
writers and mimeograph machines. 
They seem particularly fond of label- 
ing their apartments. 

In common with college under- 
grads, bachelors and others of limit- 
ed pecuniary means, science-fiction 
people share the old habit of room- 
ing together to cut food bills and 



share the good old rent. These co- 
op flats become centers of violent 
fannish activity. From their portals 
emerge tidal waves of fan maga- 
zines and all sorts of history-making 
fannish hoaxes, cults, feuds, mani- 
festos and clubs. Far-famed in song 
and story, such fan-centers are too 
significant to be known by cold, 
mathematical labels such as Apt 2B, 
104 E. 77th St. They virtually cry 
out for affectionate names which 
tend to make them stand out as 
recognizable entities. 

Great-Grandaddy of all such cog- 
nominal dwellings was the far-famed 
Sian Shack way out in the boondocks 
of Battle Creek, Michigan; in the 
dear, dead days some twenty years 
agone, when fandom was young and 



91 





giddy. Of course, I don’t have to 
tell you from whence the name was 
derived, for you doubtless recall A.E. 
Van Vogt’s great yarn, Sian, about 
the young superboy with psi talents 
galore, who was put down and put 
upon by all and sundry, even in- 
cluding other slans. Well, back in 
these by-gone days before science fic- 
tion became Respectable, fans were 
always ibeing put down for reading 
That Crazy Buck Rogers Stuff, so 
they identified swiftly with Van 
Vogt’s version of the Ugly Duckling. 
It became the fashion to, half 
seriously, consider fans as slans — 
hence the fannish multi-dwelling 
above alluded to. This first of all 
such, the original Sian Shack, was 
shared amongst some fellows named 
Al Ashley, Walt Liebscher, Jack 
Weidenbeck and, later, E. E. Evans 
(who later wrote some science-fic- 
tion novels, as you may recall). 
Even after the lease was lost, or 
whatever happens to apartments in 
the end, the term became generical- 
ly applied to similar fan-shared 
apartments. 

Sons of Sian Shock 

I get a kick out of the amusing 
and imaginative variety of these fan- 
coined names. For instance, back in 
New York in the jolly days around 
1940 or so, there was a famous 
share-the-rent movement among lo- 
cal fans who were, in those post- 
Depression and pre-War days, gen- 
erally footloose and fancy-free un- 
married types. 

There was one called the Ivory 
Tower — so-called, I am informed 



by a former resident, not in allusion 
to a secluded residence inhabited by 
scholarly recluses engaged in intel- 
lectual research, but, well, because 
the walls were painted that hue. This 
Manhattan flat was shared amongst 
Don Wollheim, Dirk Wylie and Dick 
Wilson (who later, as you may recall, 
wrote some science-fiction novels). 

When the Tower went the way of 
all flesh, the boys broke up. Dick 
Wilson went off with David A. Kyle, 
Chet Cohen and a fellow called 
Damon Knight, or, as he preferred 
to print it in those days, damon 
knight, to a place they named 
Raven’s Roost for some obscure rea- 
son, whilst the rest of the Towerites 
conglomerated at The Futurian Em- 
bassy . so-called because they all 
belonged to a club, very big in those 
dear, dead days, called The Futuri- 
ans. 

Later, around 1941 or so, various 
of these chaps and some new-comers 
foregathered in Prime Base (the 
name was borrowed from Doc 
Smith’s ‘Lensman’ series, where it 
denotes the supreme headquarters 
of the Galactic Patrol or some- 
thing). Still later, there was another 
fan-flat called Futurian Fortress, 
wherein resided Doc Lowndes, John 
Michel, and damon knight (later 
who, some science-fiction novels 
wrote, recall you may). 

Around 1943, Larry Shaw (now 
Ye Ed of Lancer Books), together 
with a chap who rejoiced in the per- 
fectly delightful name of Suddsy 
Schwartz, dwelt in an apartment 
yclept Little Jarnevon. Jarnevon was 
a planet of wicked critters in the 
‘Lensman’ yarns, which, as the more

acute of my readers may by now 
have deduced, were Pretty Big in 
those days. 

Grandsons of Sian Shack 

The cognominal habit survived the 
rigors of World War II and was still 
going strong into the early 1950’s, 
when there was quite a notorious 
residence around the neighborhood 
of Columbia University in Manhat- 
tan’s Morningside Heights, called 
Idiot’s Castle. This was not a fan- 
nish apartment, but a full sized resi- 
dence hotel loaded with small one- 
and two-room apartments in which, 
for various reasons and at various 
over-lapping times, lots of interest- 
ing people hung their hats. Promi- 
nent among these hat-hangers were 
Ron & Cindy Smith (who published 
the Hugo-winning fanzine. Inside), 
and Randall Garrett and Robert 
Silverberg and Harlan Ellison. These 
last three gents, recall you may, 
later wrote some science-fiction 
novels. Even though I was, myself, a 
frequent dropper-in at the Castle, 
memory is blank as to how the name 
came about. 

Then there was an incredibly enor- 
mous nine or ten or eleven room 
monster on Riverside Drive in Man- 
hattan, happily 'yclept Maison Ding- 
lesnaff during its earliest period, but 
later called Riverside Dive from its 
address. Herein were often found 
Art Saha, Chuck Freudenthal, Dan 
Curran, Bill Donaho, Dick Ellington 
and such guests and visitors as they 
could not persuade to leave. Those 
were gay, mad days, when four 
stereos were lined up facing the 



windows that overlooked the Hud- 
son, and Tchaikovsky’s, 1812 Over- 
ture was blasted across the river into 
Jersey at top volume, the actual can- 
non-fire on the recording doubtless 
convincing many shaken Jerseyites 
that New York was launching an in- 
vasion against their shores. 

Shortly after this, I started a sl^n 
shack myself with the proud name 
of Toad Hall — remember Mr. 
Toad’s palatial manse in Kenneth 
Graham’s Wind in the Willows? In- 
habitants were a congenial crew, in- 
cluding Stan Serxner, Chuck Freu- 
denthal, etc. Toad Hall became an 
institution and survived the loss of 
a couple of leases, the name moving 
along with the hallowed lares and 
penates to other addresses. Addresses 
and inhabitants may have changed, 
but the Hall went on into legend, 
famed for its traditional every- 
weekend party at which, on toward 
the last, as many as two hundred 
droppers-in became habitual. 

Also renowned for extravagant 
party-flinging was a slan shack call- 
ed Tlie Nunnery, a weird, roof-top 
residence on New York’s fashion- 
able, exclusive Bowery. The previous 
tenants, it seemed, had been three 
girls, and for some weeks after the 
clientele changed over from all-girl 
to all-boy, mysterious telephoners 
would ring up asking to speak to 
“Marge” or “Irma” or whatever. 
From the exclusive femininity of the 
former leasees, the name seemed a 
natural.

fan’s automobiles come in for af- 
fectionate personal names. Especial- 
ly back in the 30’s and 40’s when 
incomes were smaller and a car was 
one’s only means of travelling to 
conventions — a slender thread con- 
necting one fan to the rest of Fan- 
dom. Some of these vehicles enjoyed 
names of prestige and dignity, like 
“Andromeda II” and, presumably, 
“I” — others bore titles foreboding 
and grim, such as “Panzetkam- 
pfwagen — still more had cute 
names like “Stfnash” and so on. 

There was one affectionately 
known as “Baby,” a long-suffering 
little Ford communally owned by 
Futurians in days gone by, which 
seemed to be forever moving luggage 
and people in and out of the Ivory 
Tower and its several reincarnations. 

Religious names for cars were 
once very much In. I hasten to ex- 
plain these were fannish, or justr 
for-fun pseudo-religious. Like the 
cult dedicated to Great Ghu (re- 
putedly, a beetle-monster dwelling 
on the sunny side of Vulcan, who 
controlled a zombie known as Don- 
ald A. Wollheim via telepathy). This 
order of ghughuism, founded by 
Wollheim and Dick Wilson and John 
Michel way back in 1935 when we 
were very, very young, appealed to 
those with purple souls — remember 
what I said a few installments of 
this column ago, about how the 
hectograph used to duplicate fan- 
zines turned your fingers purple? — 
and proselytized vigorously on the 
unbeatable principle that anyone 
who even heard of the Great Ghu, 
his soul instantly turned purple. This 
is one great idea, and I have often 



been puzzled over what would hap- 
pen if the other religions got hold 
of the concept. 

Anyway, in reprisal, a rival church 
was founded a little later, under the 
title of The Sacred Order of Foo- 
Foo, dedicated to cleansing every- 
ones’ souls of the purple taint and 
re- tinting them green. The ghughu- 
ists had a Gihoily Ghible and some 
choice ecclesiastical titles: I recall 
Dick Wilson was Ghuardian of the 
Gholy Ghrail. FooFooi§m retaliated 
in kind. 

As latecomer and underdog, 
FooFoo gained many adherents. 
Their major activity — at least, in 
retrospect, it seems that way — was 
largely confined to naming automo- 
biles. Let’s see, now . there was 
Empress of FooFoo, a car Louis 
Kuslan owned during his college 
days . and Art Widner’s first mo- 
bile was called The Skylark of Foo. 
Later, I guess, Widner became sadly 
engulfed in a rival religion, some 
foul heresy on other, because the 
Dodge sedan that bore him to the 
1940 World Convention was known 
far and wide as Skylark of Woo- 
Woo. I am happy to say that, as a 
church, Woo-Wooism did not long 
survive. 

Then there was a 1937 Plymouth 
owned by a well-known fan named 
Jack Speer (now, I believe, practis- 
ing law). It was far-famed as The 
Spirit of FooFoo . and I can 
hark back to a Ford of unremem- 
bered or unknown vintage, the Foo- 
Foo Special, which made a spectacu- 
lar trip from the depths of distant 
Philadelphia all the way to the Den- 
ver science-fiction convention (and, 



94 



IF 




after a certain fashion, back), with 
Milton A. Rothman and Bob Madle 
at the helm, as it were, plus a clutch 
of fellow-travellers. 

Going behind Ghu and FooFoo 
to what must have been their ulti- 
mate and original source (H.P. Love- 
craft), New Orleans fan Harry B. 
Moore sported a vehicle once, known 
as The Triumphal Chariot of Cthul- 
hu. Ah — those were the days! 

Then there are other mechanisms 
which become infested with the nam- 
ing-craze. I, for example, had and 
still have a tape recorder of staunch 
heart and sound components, known 
as Ole Reliable. And many fans have 
granted cognomens to their trusty, 
long-suffering typewriters: such as 
the Corona owned by Ernie Auer- 
bach. known as Slippery Sam be- 
cause of an insecurely b^ded shift- 
lock. A typewriter of nameless make, 
owned by some opponent to ghughu- 
ism, rejoiced in the title of Sacred 
Oracle of FooFoo. And so on . 



Sometimes, I’ll freely admit with- 
out coercion, you can really get car- 
ried away with this sort of thing. 
Way back in the remote and forgot- 
ten era called The Thirties — to be 
precise, in 1937 — at some conven- 
tion or other, which one I don’t re- 
member at this late date, Fred Pohl 
and his cohorts commandeered an 
elevator in the convention hotel for 
a brief space of time and — In a mood 
of joyous exaltation — christened it 
with the impressively Lovecraftian 
name of “The Shaggoth 6” and 
rode it madly up and down the ele- 
vator shaft for about a quarter of an 
hour, ignoring signals and shunning 
would-be passengers — with, all the 
time, the operator and a frenzied 
hotel manager in close pursuit not 
far behind in another car. 

I draw a merciful veil over What 
Happened when the Shaggoth 6 end- 
ed its joyful and epic ride and came, 
as we all have to come eventually, 
down to earth at last . END

The 

Ghost Galaxies 

by PIERS ANTHONY 



Illustrated by ADKINS 



Out beyond the rim of space they 
sought an answer to the universe's 
most fearful question — or death!

4CT7iS}it point ei^t one” the 
pilot’s voice counted off over 
the intercom. Tliirty seconds passed. 
“Eigjit point eight two.” 

Captain Shetland’s eye passed to 



the hunched man seated across the 
cabin, then went on to the port. 
Already the red shift, or something 
analogous, was distorting the view 
of space. 

M^iat an anachronism, he thought. 
A direct-vision port on a Faster- 



96 




Than- Light ship. The Meg II was 
fresh from the construction dock 
and theoretically designed througji- 
out for FTL travel .... 

“Light speed,*’ the intercom an- 
nounced, and the port was void. 
“Eight point eight three.** 

“Thank you, Johns,” the captain 
said. 

His voice did not reflect the ten- 
sion he fdt. 

Shetland had passed the speed of 
light many times, but never with 
comfort. FTL was not simply a high 
velocity. The restrictions of conven- 
tional physics could not be set aside 
with impunity. In the captain’s mind 
were four great dreads, and as he 
closed his eyes a notebook appeared, 
with an old-fashioned wire-coil bind- 
ing. On its cover was a picture of a 
small and shaggy pony and a single 
word: PRIVATE. The booklet 

opened, exposing a lightly ruled 
sheet, and from offstage appeared 
an animated pencil, freshly sharp- 
ened, tooth marks on the latter end. 
The pencil twirled and wrote: 

THE FOUR DEADLY 
DREADS OF CAPTAIN 
SHETLAND. 

L Beacon, failure of. 

2. Drive, malfunction of. 

3. Personality, distortion of. 

4. Unknown, the. 

It pleased him to note, as always, 
the alphabetical arrangement of the 
terms, and the entire mental process 
of itemizing them reassured him. 
Fears that could be outlined in a 
notebook lost some of their power. 
This was good, for their power was 



great. One of them had taken, after 
thirty hours, the Meg 7. 

Stop that! he commanded himself. 
Even his carelessly wandering 
th ought s were exceedingly dangerous 
in FTL. 

S hetland’s ga 2 ^ returned to the 
seated man. This was Somnan- 
da, operator of the beacon. 

Somnanda sat without motion or 
expression. His forehead was high, 
the hair above it dark but sparse. His 
long ears seemed to be listening in- 
tently for something beyond the con- 
fines of the cabin, of the ship itself. 
His eyes, half closed, were a curious, 
faded gray, their color suggesting a 
nictitating membrane. The lips and 
mouth were more delicate than one 
would expect in so large a man. 
Somnanda gave the impression of 
nobility, almost of sainthood. 

On the table before him was a 
small box with a facsimile of a burn- 
ing candle above it. Somnanda’s un- 
wavering gaze centered upon this 
light. His two mighty hands rested 
above the table, blue-ridged veins 
curling over the raised tendons in 
back. The fingers touched the sur- 
face lightly on either side of the 
candle. 

Somnanda moved. His head swiv- 
eled gradually, turret-like, to cover 
Shetland. “It is well. Captain,” he 
said, his voice so deep and strong 
that there almost seemed to be a 
staccato echo from the walls sur- 
rounding them. 

Shetland relaxed at last. Behind 
his eyes the notebook reappeared, 
reopened. The pencil drew a neat 
line through Dread No. 1. 



THE GHOST GALAXIES 



97 




The beacon was functioning prop- 
erly — so far. 

When a ship entered FTL, the 
normal universe existed only ten- 
uously. Relatives to that ship, to its 
crew and many of its instruments, 
planets and even stars became ghost- 
like, present but insubstantial. Exter- 
nal light and gravity registered only 
as an indication on a meter. Inter- 
nally, the laws of physics applied as 
always; Meg II required power for 
illumination, temperature control, the 
operation of its instruments and the 
rapid rotation that provided arti- 
ficial gravity. But physical communi- 
cation with Earth — and any elec- 
tronic or laser-based signal had to 
be regarded as such — ^was impossible, 
because the ship no longer occupied 
the- same specific universe as Earth. 

There was complex circuitry em- 
bedded in the table beneath Somnan- 
da’s tapering fingers. But it was 
psionic circuitry, incomprehensible 
to normal science. The actual mech- 
anism of communication was large- 
ly in the operator’s mind and sub- 
ject to no tangible verification — 
aside from the fact that it worked. 

The light, a flickering mock 
candle, was the evidence that the 
beacon was functioning. It lit the 
way to Earth. No instrument could 
retrace the course of the Meg II 
with sufficient accuracy to bring the 
ship home. Not when the distance 
traveled was to be measured in meg- 
aparsecs. Not when the universe it- 
self was indistinct. Only this steady 
beacon, this metaphysical elastic con- 
nection, could guide them back even 
to the correct galactic cluster. Only 
Somnanda. 



“Captain.” 

Shetland recovered with a start. 
“I’m sorry, Somnanda. Was I worry- 
ing again?” 

The man smiled slowly. “No, 
Captain. You were not disturbing 
the beacon. I wished simply to re- 
mind you that your move was due.” 

Shetland had forgotten their game 
of chess. The lonely hours of space 
made some sort of diversion essen- 
tial. “Of course.” He closed his 
eyes, seeing the checkered board. 
His king was in check. “White, 23. 
King to King two. No pun intend- 
ed.” 

Somnanda nodded. It would be 
another hour before he replied with 
his own move, for he, like the cap- 
tain, was a deliberate man. There 
was time, and each development was 
to be savored, never rushed. 

“Somnanda,” he said. The som- 
ber head rose. “Do you know the 
purpose of this expedition?” 

“The Milky- Way Galaxy is only 
thirty thousand parsecs in diameter,” 
Somnanda replied seriously. “Far 
too small to test the beacon proper- 
ly. We are traveling far.” 

That should be added to the note- 
book, Shetland thought. The under- 
statement of the space age. The 
Meg IV s itinerary was to take her, 
literally, to the edge of the universe. 
As had that of the first Meg . 

“Captain.” 

Why did their conversation lapse 
so readily? “Again, Somnanda?” 

“There is an . inbalance . 
in the beacon.” 

S hetland felt the cold clutch of 
fear at his stomach. Immediate- 



98 



IF 




ly the candle flickered higher, a 
yellowish flash. 

Fear was the nemesis of the bea- 
con — no error there! What irony if 
his own alarm at news of danger to 
the beacon should extinguish it! He 
exerted control over his emotions, 
watched the little flame subside and 
become even. 

This was a temporary measure. 
Somnanda, a man of polite conser- 
vatism, had given clear warning. 
Something was interfering with the 
function of the beacon. It was not 
serious at the moment — but in FTL 
such things seldom resolved them- 
selves. As the Meg^s speed increased, 
so would the disturbance, until firm 
action became mandatory. 

But what was the source? It had 
to be a man who either knew or 
suspected their true mission and was 
frightened by it. The great majority 
of the crewmen had not been in- 
formed of the special nature of this 
mission and had no way to learn 
that the Meg was establishing re- 
cords in FTL. 

The notebook reappeared. The 
pencil turned about, erased the first 
Dread, wrote it in again without the 
line through the words. It sketched 
an arrow leading from it down to 
No. 3: Personality f distortion of. 
Linked dangers. 

The pencil hesitated, then made 
subheadings under No. 3, leaving a 
space after each: A, Sommanda; B. 
Shetland; C. Johns; D. Beeton, The 
captain noted the inversely alpha- 
betized listing and frowned, buit let 
it stand. The pencil returned to the 
first, paused again, wrote: 

A, Somnanda — Most experienced 



& reliable communicator in space. 

Steady temper. Personal friend. 

Was he lowing friendship to in- 
fluence him? This could not be af- 
forded. The pencil backtracked, 
crossed out the last two words. 

Still, Somnanda was the least like- 
ly of suspects. If he lost control, 
there would be no appeal. No one 
else could maintain the beacon. 

B. Shetland * — Captain^ exper- 
ienced. Knowledge of danger. Can 
control emotion. 

How can a man judge himself? 
In the act of writing he had crossed 
out a word, made a correction: he 
only suspected the various dangers, 
could not claim full knowledge. Yet 
his position was unique. He alone 
had sufficient information to ac- 
complish their mission. He had to 
exonerate himself or admit failure 
at the outset. Rationalization? 

C. Johns — Pilot {drive mechanic). 

The pencil stopped. The record 

said that Johns was competent, but 
Shetland had not voyaged with him 
before. How could he be sure of 
this man? Or was he allowing him- 
self to be prejudiced because Johns 
had replaced another friend? 

Objectivity was essential. He 
would have to have a talk with 
Johns — but not immediately. The 
man, his schedule informed him, 
was about to go off duty and would 
not return until the eighteenth hour. 
That was convenient for another 
reason . and it was also important 
not to upset the sleeping schedule. 
Lack of sleep was one of the surest 
routes to emotional imbalance. 

D. Beeton — Cartographer, ap- 
prentice. 



THE GHOST GALAXIES 



99 




The pencil stalled once more. Ap- 
prentice. That meant he had never 
had an assignment in FTL before. 
Shetland had not even met him. 
Young, inexperienced and in a posi- 
tion to comprehend both mission 
and danger. A very likely suspect. 
But again, the time was not now. 
Special factors had relevance, and a 
proper interview was quite possibly 
essential to the success of the mis- 
sion. 

Shetland turned about and set 
course for his own cabin. He was not 
tired, but he intended to sleep. 

n 

S hip’s clock said 19. Shetland en- 
tered the pilot’s compartment 
and stood behind the man. “Johns,” 
he said. 

The pilot jumped to attention. 
“Sir.” He was a small, somewhat 
stout man, whose thin blond hair 
made his scalp seem prematurely 
bald. His features were regular ex- 
cept for a slightly receding chin. 
Shetland knew from the records, 
which were comprehensive, that 
Johns was an excellent craftsman, 
well suited to his job. Shetland knew 
— and tried to suppress his irrational 
dislike of the man. 

“I see we stand at 19,” he said, 
sounding inane in his own ears. 
“That, of course, is our velocity, in 
spite of the fact that we schedule 
the affairs of the ship by that clock. 
Would you care to translate our 
speed into something, ah, more spe- 
cific?” 

Johns tried to restrain a patron- 
izing smile. “As you know, sir, the 



drive is designed to reflect speed in 
miles per hour, varying exponential- 
ly with the passage of time. Our vel- 
ocity is indicated by the logarithmic 
dial of the ship’s clock. Thus our 
present speed, relative to galactic 
stasis at — ” 

“Assume that I’m an idiot,” Shet- 
land said. 

“Yes, s/r!** Johns tried again. 
“When the clock indicates 1, it 
means that the ship is traveling at 
ten raised to the first power, or ten 
miles per hour. At 2, thisds equiva- 
lent to ten squared, or a hundred 
miles per hour. 3 on the clock is a 
thousand mph, 4 is 10,000 mph, and 
so on. 9 is already beyond the speed 
of light.” 

“Very good. Why, then, do we 
call it a ‘clock’?” 

“Because that’s what it is, sir. The 
figure on the dial also represents the 
time in hours since the drive was cut 
in. That’s the way they engineered it. 
We have been under way for — ” he 
glanced again at the clock — ” 19.12 
hours, and our present velocity 
therefore is — ” a second pause to 
manipulate his slide rule, while Shet- 
land smiled inwardly at the condi- 
tioning this exposed — “approximate- 
ly twenty billion times the speed of 
light.” 

Johns looked up, startled at his 
own words. “Twenty bil — !” 

“We travel fast,” Shetland said. 
“Hardly surprising in view of the 
purpose of this voyage.” 

J oihns nodded, dazed. “Yet. Test- 
ing the performance of the drive 
and shield at the big MPH is a tall 
order. Takes us right out of the gal- 



100 



IF 




axy. And we’ve just about done it 
already. 19.283 is one full megapar- 
sec per hour. 1 MPH. Over three 
million light-years in a thin sixty 
minutes . 

Shetland frowned, his fingers beat- 
ing little cadences on the panel be- 
low the clock. Somnanda saw the 
voyage as a test of the beacon; 
Johns saw it as a test of the drive. 
What would Beeton see? 

The pliot, misunderstanding, 
launched into another explanation. 
“We have to check it out before 
turning it over to private enterprise. 
We know so little about the drive 
and the part of it that we call the 
shield. Yet it would be impossible 
to travel in FTL without some kind 
of protection. Part of the energy of 
the drive is diverted to form the 
shield that isolates us from normal 
space. It's actually an adaptation of 
the available Cherenkov radia- 
tion — ” 

It was time for the shock. “Were 
you assuming that the Meg II was 
going to stop at one MPH?” 

John’s eyes widened. “We’re not 
stopping, sir?” 

Tlie intercom came to life. It was 
Somnanda. “Captain to the beacon 
as convenient.” 

Shetland nodded to himself. The 
beacon had flared. Yet it was not 
conclusive. He himself had made the 
beacon react when caught offguard. 
Every man had his moments. 

“Does speed frighten you, Johns?” 

Johns licked his lips. “How — 
how much?” 

“Thirty.” 

Johns stared at the clock. ^'Thirty? 
Sir, have you any idea how fast that 



is?” He took refuge in his slide rule. 
“We’re doing twenty billion times 
the speed of light now — and that 
will just about square it, Captain.” 
He shook his head negatively. “To 
answer your question, sir — no, I 
can’t be frightened by that. I’m used 
to big figures, but this doesn’t mean 
anything to me. I can’t visuaUze it. 
So how can I be frightened? Mean- 
while, I know the drive can do it, 
and I’m game to try.” 

Shetland did not agree with the 
pilot’s reasoning: most men did fear 
~what they could not visualize. But it 
seemed that Johns had survived his 
crisis and come to terms with it. He 
could not be considered a prime sus- 
pect. 

Beeton had to be the one. He 
would go and pick up Somnanda’s 
chess move, then gird himself for 
the most difficult interview. 

“Why thirty?” Johns inquired. 
“. Sir.” 

Because that’s where Death awaits 
us, Shetland thought. “Orders, 
Pilot.” 

Death orders? 

Ill 

B eeton’s cabin was typical of what 
was expected of a young space- 
man: the neat military bunk, the foot 
locker, the shapely pinups on the 
wall. 

Shetland dismissed the pictures im- 
mediately. He knew that every man 
under thirty put them up as a matter 
of protocol. But after one discounted 
the window-dressing, a man’s room 
was often a pretty fair indication of 
his personality. 



THE GHOST GALAXIES 



101 





Nothing. Everything was in or- 
der. allowing no personal signs. 
Beeton was almost too careful to 
conform. Only one thing showed 
personality: a chess set on the cor- 
ner desk, with a game in progress. 
Even this was no giveaway. Tedium 
came to everyone in space. 

He examined the game with a 
clinical interest, noting the advan- 
tageous position held by Black. This 
game would soon be over. 

Realization struck him. This was 
no ordinary game. This was a rep- 
lica of bis match with Somnanda, 
complete to the last move. A game 
that he had thought existed only in 
the minds of the two of them. And 
Somnanda was Black. 

“What can I do for you, Cap- 
tain?” The cartographer had come 
upon him by surprise.

Beeton was a tall, blond lad. His 
face had that fresh-out-of-school 
look: sanguine and unlined, eyes 
startlingly blue and innocent. But the 
records placed his age at 24. 

“I was admiring your game,” 
Shetland said. 

Beeton had the grace to flush. 
“You might call that a spectator 
sport, sir.” 

“As spectator, who would you 
say had the better position?” 

“Well, sir, Tm sure I could win 
with White.” 

The captain smiled faintly. “You 
should know that FTL career men 
are noted for memory, not intelli- 
gence, and that they retain few il- 
lusions.” 

“I’m sorry, sir. I must admit that

Beeton expressed surprise. “You Shetland opened the big dictionary

in his mind and skimmed the page. 
It was true. “And I want to assure 
you, Captain, that that megalocar- 
pous specimen on the wall is not 
Alice.” Shetland riffled through his 
dictionary again, smiled when he 
found the word. Beeton was playing 
games with him, forcing him back. 

“Do you know how I met her, 
Captain? I was sitting in a public 
library, studying a text on psychol- 
ogy, when I overheard this kind of 
clip-clop, clip-clop coming up behind 
me. For a startled moment all I 
could think of was a horse. You 
know the sound those primitive ani- 
mals make when some rich showman 
takes them across a concrete street, 
the metal-shod hoofs ringing out like 
castanets. I couldn’t resist turning 
around in my chair to see what 
could make that kind of noise in a 
library. Of course it turned out to be 
two girls in heels. But that horse was 
still in my mind, and you know, 
their feet did resemble hoofs in an 
attractive way. Their legs were 
clean and supple, rather like those 
of a thoroughbred. 

“I laughed out loud. (Now I know 
why they call them "fillies,”) I said. 
One of those girls heard that, and 
she came over to ask me just what 
I meant. Her tone was severe. That 
was the first time I had a really good 
look at her, aside from her ankles. 
She had on a knitted green dress, 
form-fitting over an excellent form 
. might as well admit it, I was 
srhitten by her appearance. One 
thing led to another — ” 

“So that was Alice.” 

“No. Alice was the other girl. I 
didn’t pay any attention to her that 



time. She — well, it gets a little com- 
plicated. I don’t suppose your rec- 
ords cover that sort of thing.” 

Shetland got the point. The rec- 
ords were illusory. They told him 
nothing that would enable him to 
understand this too clever young 
man. He was being gently told to 
mind his own business. 

How he wished he could! But Bee- 
ton was still the prime suspect, and 
if there was fear concealed behind 
that voluble facade, the captain had 
to know it. 

“You’ve admitted that your early 
scholastics were not remarkable. 
What caused you to change?” For 
here, perhaps, the record did offer a 
take-off point. The shift had been 
abrupt, and it had been from indif- 
ferent to absolute brilliance. There 
were personal comments by several 
instructors: “Jumps to accurate con- 
clusions.” “An intuitive thinker; 
never makes a mistake in theory.” 
“Even cheating is not that sharp!” 

Beeton’s tone was flippant. “May- 
be I was afraid. Captain. Afraid that 
the ghost of my past would come 
back to haunt me. These days a 
degree is not enough; there were too 
many decades of assembly-line doc- 
torates that degraded the magic. 
They delve into your records, as well 
you know. If I had left behind me a 
reputation for careless work — ” 

Was the young man still taunting 
him, showing the flag to the bull? Or 
was there genuine tension now? 

“. though that’s an unfortunate 
way to put it,” Beeton was saying. 
“ ‘Ghost,’ I mean. I always was afraid 
of the supernatural. Sometimes I 
suspect that my whole interest in 



104 



IF 




science was spurred by a lingering 
fear of ghosts. As though I were try- 
ing to shine a light in the dark 
corners, to prove that nothing non- 
physical could possibly hurt me, be- 
cause there was nothing there. Seems 
ridiculous now.” 

C hildhood fears. It did not seem 
ridiculous to Shetland. 

For the Meg II at this moment the 
entire universe had become non- 
physical. They were traveling at such 
a rate that an entire galaxy could be 
traversed in less than a second, and 
it made no difference whether the 
ship passed near or through it. How 
easy to invoke the sense of unreality, 
to renew the fierce early terrors. 

How easy, too, to play upon the 
credulity of a meddling captain . 

“Does the Academy still teach 
Einstein?” Shetland inquired with a 
smile. 

Beeton smiled too, seeming to re- 
lax. “It still does. But of course it’s 
a mistake to assume that FTL dis- 
proves his work. The General The- 
ory never did limit an object to the 
speed of light. Though I doubt that 
the old gentleman anticipated — 
what is our present speed?” 

Shetland did not miss the nervous 
throb, the slight terror showing in 
the tips of the fingers. Beeton knew 
the time, and he could do conver- 
sions. His question seemed like a 
plea for confirmation — or denial. 

He looked at his watch. It said 
22.9, drive time. “Just over a mega- 
parsec per second. Our mission re- 
quires high speed.” 

Beeton rose to the bait, definitely 
nervous now. “It certainly does. This 



voyage will rewrite the text on celes- 
tial cartology. My instruments are 
recording the placement and pattern 
of every galaxy and cluster within a 
billion parsecs of our course — 
though I must admit that our pres- 
ent velocity makes this seem tiny. It 
will take many years for the com- 
puters back on Earth to assimilate 
the information we collect in hours. 
But our journey will be over in ten 
minutes.” 

Shetland could not conceal his 
astonishment. “It will?” 

“Certainly. It began with the vast 
primeval explosion that flung mat- 
ter and radiation in every direction 
to populate the vacant space. Then 
gravity slowed this impetuous ex- 
pansion and brought the universe 
into a state of equilibrium two bil- 
lion light-years in diameter. But when 
the yalaxies formed, the forces of re- 
pulsion came into prominence, and 
expansion resumed. Now five billion 
years have passed since the begin- 
ning, and our universe has grown to 
a radius of three billion parsecs. In 
moments we stand at the culmina- 
tion of it all, our mission is over: 
the rim.” 

To every man his own justifica- 
tion for the voyage, Shetland thought. 
To every man his own disillusion. 

“Not yet,” he said succinctly. 

Beeton’s innocent eyes fociised on 
him. “You have to stop, of course. 
There is no point going beyond the 
rim of the universe.” 

Shetland spoke carefully. “Ac- 
cording to your theory, there should 
be a cessation of all matter at ap- 
proximately 23.1 on the clock. I 
have asked to be alerted the moment 



THE GHOST GALAXIES 



105 




such cessation occurs. None has. It 
is now 23.2 hours. There has been 
no ‘rim.* We diall not stop.*’ 

Beeton turned pale. His breath 
came in labored gasps. His eyes star- 
ed unblinldngly at the captain. 

The intercom blared out behind 
Shetland with startling volume. 
“Captain to beacon immediately!” 

IV 

S hetland whirled, paying no more 
attention to Beeton. He gallop- 
ed headlong down the corridor, 
blood pounding in his ears. The 
shortness of his breath, he knew, was 
not entirely due to the exertion. 

He burst into Somnanda’s cabin. 
And stopped, appalled. The minia- 
ture candle, symbol of Earth-contact, 
was a towering column of fire. 
Orange light flooded the room, flick- 
ering off the walls and illuminating 
Somnanda’s twisted face with demon- 
iac intensity. 

Shetland knew instinctively what 
to do. Terror was destruction to the 
beacon. He stood there, suppressing 
every vestige of feeling, quelling his 
own throbbing pulse with hypnotic 
waves of peace and security. Mem- 
bers of the crew had fears; these 
were groundless, based on ignorance. 
Only the captain had authority to 
know, and he was not afraid. Not 
afraid. 

Not afrhid. 

Gradually he extended the oily 
calm outward. Somnanda was not 
afraid. No one was afraid. A tem- 
porary shock, no more. To be for- 
gotten. 

The fearsome color faded. The 



column dwindled reluctantly, down, 
down, imtil it returned to its normal 
pinpoint above the table. 

Somnanda’s countenance relaxed. 
Apparently a disturbance in the bea- 
con represented physical pain to 
him. His hands remained above the 
table, fingers splayed, their backs an 
angry red. His forehead was shin- 
ing, and rivulets of perspiration were 
draining down the side of his neck. 

“My strength has been overex- 
tended,” Somnanda said, his words 
slurred, voice pitched* too high. “I 
can not protect the beacon again. 
From that."" 

So formal, even after this, Shet- 
land thought. Yet I must talk to him. 
As Beeton is to me, so am I to this 
man of the candle. The tension is 
within me, and it must come out. 
And when my brain has translated 
itself into nervous impulses, and 
these pulses become the atmospheric 
vibrations which are meaningful 
speech sounds, and those sounds 
have been lost in entropy, then will 
my problem be over? 

“A farmer once lost a sum of 
money,” Shetland said. “He suspect- 
ed a neighbor’s boy of having stolen 
it, but had not proof. So the farmer 
went and studied the boy as he went 
about his chores, trying to determine 
by observation whether he was in fact 
the culprit. Though the lad perform- 
ed his duties in the prescribed man- 
ner, there did appear to be something 
surreptitious in his attitude, as though 
he were trying to conceal guilt. The 
farmer returned home convinced. 
Later he discovered the money where 
he had forgotten it, in his own home. 
It had never been stolen. He went 



106 



IF 




again to look at the neighbor’s boy, 
but this time the lad had no guilty 
look about him.” 

“The young cartographer looks 
guilty,” Somnanda said. 

“He looks guilty,” Shetland 
agreed. “He seemed almost normal 
until I challenged his evolutionary 
theory of the universe. Then — this. 
But I can not condemn a person on 
such circumstantial evidence. I too, 
in the last analysis, am afraid.” 

S omnanda’s brow wrinkled. “I am 
not entirely familiar with this 
theory. Is there something about it 
that affects the nature of our voy- 
age?” 

Shetland smiled inwardly. In Som- 
nanda’s view the purpose of this 
journey was merely to test the bea- 
con. TTie validity of one theory of 
the universe or another would have 
little bearing on that, unless one 
theory embodied an inherent threat 
to the beacon. That threat was real 
enough — but it stemmed from in- 
ternal problems, not external. 

“The evolutionary theory is one 
of several evolved — again, no pun 
— to explain the observed state of 
the universe,” Shetland explained. 
“There are numberless clusters of 
galaxies in view from Earth, each 
retreating from every other one. The 
situation can only be explained by 
postulating a general expansion of 
the entire cosmos. But the nature of 
this expansion is open to doubt. This 
particular theory has all matter ori- 
ginating in a gigantic nucleus five 
billion years ago. When it explod- 
ed—” 

“Now I understand,” Somnanda 



said. “That would make every galaxy 
approximately the same age. I had 
assumed that the more distant ones 
were older.” 

“They may well be,” Shetland 
said. “The information we are gath- 
ering now may answer that question 
when we return to Earth. But it is 
my conjecture that this theory is 
invalid, because we have already 
passed the farthest limit the evo- 
lutionary universe could have reach- 
ed, and the pattern has not changed.” 
“Would this be reason to frighten 
the cartographer?” 

Shetland paced the floor. “I don’t 
understand why. That’s what holds 
me back. The elimination of a single 
theory should be of no more conse- 
quence than the elimination of an 
invalid strategy in the course of a 
chess game. An inconvenience, cer- 
tainly. But hardly frightening.” 
“Unless the alternative is more 
dangerous.” 

“The obvious alternative at this 
point would be the “Steady State” 
theory, which has galaxies continu- 
ously forming and being forced out- 
ward by the constant appearance of 
new matter. Since there is no ‘begin- 
ning’ the universe is steady in space 
and time and does not evolve. In- 
dividual galaxies, however, would 
evolve, and we should discover old 
ones as well as new ones. And the 
universe would be somewhat larger.” 
“Larger?” 

“Because the evolutionary uni- 
verse would be in its infancy, limited 
by the five-billion-year span since 
the explosion. But the average gal- 
axy will survive for ten times that 
length of time, and if we assume the 



THE GHOST GALAXIES 



107 




expansion to be exponential, the uni- 
verse could eventually attain a radius 
of ten thousand teraparsecs, give or 
take a decimal or two.” 

Somnanda digested this. “One ter- 
aparsec is — ” 

“A million megs. But our drive 
will take us there in just thirty 
hours.” 

“That would be the size of the 
steady state universe, since it is not 
in its . infancy?” 

“If my conjecture is correct. The 
cartographer, actually, should under- 
stand such things better than I. He 
is attempting to map the universe.” 
“Perhaps he knows something that 
we do not.” 

Shetland paced the floor again. 
“He never mentioned steady state. 
It was as though it didn’t exist for 
him.” 

“Possibly he has reason for his 
fear. This should be ascertained.” 
What decision had the captain of 
the Meg I made? Had he waited until 
thirty hours to question his “Bee- 
ton”? Or had some unthinkable men- 
ace consumed his ship at the rim of 
the steady state cosmos? 

The decision of the prior captain 
had been wrong. How could Shet- 
land improve upon it, in his ignor- 
ance? 

V 

T^e ship’s clock stood at 25 when 
A Beeton entered the beacon room. 
“Reporting as directed, sir.” 
Shetland was afraid to waste time. 
He watched the candle as he spoke. 
“I believe you are afraid of some- 
thing, Beeton, and it is important for 



me to understand. Such emotion af- 
fects the beacon.” 

Beeton met him with a steady gaze 
in which there was. not a trace of 
fear. “May I speak frankly, sir?” 
When a crewman felt it necessary 
to address that question to the cap- 
tain, the result was seldom pleasant. 
“You are directed to do so.” 

“I’d like to rephrase the ques- 
tion,” Beeton said, dropping the 
“sir.” He was intelligent and had 
probably anticipated' this session. “I 
think I’m afraid of the same thing 
you are. Will you admit that much?” 
“I am afraid of many things. Con- 
tinue.” 

“We fear a very real danger, and 
it has nothing to do with the beacon. 
You and I know that there is death 
waiting for us at the edge of the 
universe. One ship has already been 
taken, perhaps others.” 

Somnanda looked up but held his 
peace. 

“The important thing to realize is 
that this was no freak accident. We 
face the same demise, unless we re- 
verse the drive.” 

“No,” Shetland said simply. 
Johns poked his head in the en- 
trance. “Am I intemipting some- 
thing?” he inquired. “My assistant 
took over long enough for me to in- 
quire — ” 

“You should listen to this,” Bee- 
ton said with authority. Somnanda 
nodded. 

Shetland glanced from one to the 
other. “Was there a mute agreement 
between them? How many were an- 
xious to abort the mission? The sit- 
uation was uncomfortable. 

Johns also seemed to be ill at

Shetland looked at Somnanda, who 
shook his head negatively. He look- 
ed at Johns, whose mouth was hang- 
ing open. 

“You’re crazy!” Johns said. 

Beeton jump^ up, and the flame 
leaped with him. “No, no,” he cried. 
“You have to understand. You have 
to stop the ship before it’s too late.” 

“The supernatural is no threat to 
us,” Shetland snapped. 

“Captain!” Somnanda’s voice was 
urgent. Shetland whipped around. 
The beacon had burst into an in- 
ferno, destroying itself. 

“Stop the ship!” Beeton screamed. 
“The ghost is out there — ” 

Suddenly Shetland’s sidearm was 
in his hand. The tableau seemed to 
freeze at the moment: Somnanda in 
the corner, half standing, agony on 
his face, sweat shining in the orange 
glow. Johns, staring at the young 
cartographer, confusion and incred- 
ulity distorting his own features, 
scalp red under the thin hair. Beeton, 
standing with one fist in the air, 
mouth insanely wide, lips pulled back 
from teeth. 

One word from the captain would 
ease this threat. He had only to 
agree to stop the ship. To set aside 
his orders. 

Then Beeton was falling, engulfed 
in a sparkling cloud. The gas from 
the capsule Shetland had fired was 
dissipating already; but Beeton v/ould 
be in a deep coma for at least twelve 
hours. Far past the crisis point. 

“Captain.” Somnanda’s voice cut 
through his reverie, as it always did. 
“There is little doubt that the young 
man’s terror was the cause of the 
disturbance. But it should have abat- 



ed, had you agreed to reverse the 
drive.” 

The flame was normal. “I could 
not do that.” 

Johns made a sound. “You knew 
how simple it was to stop the trou- 
ble — and you cooled him anyway?” 

“Yes.” 

Johns stared at him with the same 
expression he had turned on Beeton 
before. “Captain — now I’m not so 
sure Beeton was the crazy one. May- 
be he was right. You never let him 
make his point.” 

Shetland looked at the unconscious 
form, so peaceful now. “If I had 
verified his suspicion. Pilot, his ter- 
ror would certainly have extinguish- 
ed the beacon.” 

“Verified his — ” Johns was shock- 
ed. “You admit it! There is a ghost 
out there!” 

“Not a ghost. A ship. A ship that 
ceased contact suddenly. My orders 
are to investigate. I shall investi- 
gate.” 

“By heading straight into the same 
trap?” 

“Those are my orders.” 

4t/^rders!” The flame was rising 
again. “Captain, I can’t 
agree to that.” 

Shetland studied him sourly. “Yom 
can’t agree, Pilot?” 

“No. I can’t. That ghost will eat 
us too. We’ve got to turn back.” 

Beside the growing flame, Som- 
nanda’s head turned to bear on 
Johns. 

“I see it now,” the pilot said. 
“Beeton was right. After the galaxies 
die, they are ghosts. And they hate 
the living.” He looked around, saw

the flame. “Don’t you understand? 
We must reverse the shipP* 

The flash, the sparkle, the dissi- 
pation — and the pilot joined the 
cartographer. 

The flame subsided. Somnanda 
and Shetland looked at each other. 

“Your move, Captain.” 

The chess game: Somnanda could 
think of that at this juncture! “I 
only hope my personal situation is 
better than that of my pieces,” he 
said. “I will have to consider my 
move.” 

“Your situation is good,” Som- 
nanda said cryptically. 

Shetland hauled the two uncon- 
scious men to the side of the cabin. 
“I think it best to keep these out of 
sight of the other crewmen, for the 
time being,” he said. Then, sensing 
Somnanda’s curiosity: “It may seem 
unreasonable to sacrifice two human 
beings in this fashion, rather than 
accede to their rather simple request. 
But I can delegate their functions if 
necessary, while I could neither hu- 
mor their fancies nor allow their 
emotional stress to destroy the bea- 
con.” Yes, he felt the need to justify 
himself to Sommanda and curs^ his 
own frailty. 

“You seem unreasonable.” From 
this man, this was an observation, 
not an insult. 

“I am unreasonable. Sometimes 
that is the only course — just as an 
apparently illogical sacrifice is at 
times required in order to win at 
chess.” TTie chess analogy kept run- 
ning through his mind. Was it valid? 

Somnanda waited. 

“Extended trips into FTL have 
been rare, so far,” Shetland contin- 



ued. “Evidence is therefore incon- 
clusive. But there appears to be a 
certain . distortion in many per- 
sonalities as velocity increased. Per- 
haps it is a side effect of the drive, 
or simply an emotional reaction to 
isolation from the normal universe. 
But it is one of my dreads, and I 
always watch for it. That’s why I’m 
careful about revealing my orders 
prematurely. Individual judgment 
can not be trusted in FTL. Normal 
people are apt to become aware of 
it. It is futile to point out such aber- 
rations to the victims. They are, in 
effect, mental patients. I think you 
have seen some of this, now.” 

“Yes.” 

“The captain is not excluded,” 
Shetland said, smiling wearily. “I 
have preoccupations and I entertain 
doubts. I question the wisdom of 
this voyage, its apparent expendabil- 
ity, the attitude of certain crewmen, 
the evidence of the supernatural. I 
do not believe, at this moment, in 
the beacon — that is, that it repre- 
sents any valid connection with 
Earth. But if it is real, why not the 
gho^t of a galaxy? I do anticipate 
extinction at the thirtieth hour — 
but I will not reverse the drive.” 

“I understand.” 

“Because my own judgment is 
suspect. I can rely on only one thing 
to be objective: my orders. These 
were presented to me before the voy- 
age began and were reasonable then; 
they must be reasonable now. If I de- 
sire to modify them, it is because 
my present insight is biased, not my 
earlier one. I must therefore uphold 
what seems unreasonable to me — 
and I shall.” 



THE GHOST GALAXIES

VI 

T he clock read 28.8 hours. One 
teraparsec per second. Soon the 
voyage would really be over — one 
way or another. 

Shetland found himself in Bee- 
ton’s room, looking at the chess set. 
Why had he come? Because there 
was a lingering uncertainty as the 
thirtieth hour approached? Or sim- 
ple guilt for overriding that uncer- 
tainty? 

He saw a picture of Alice, smil- 
ing for a man she might never see 
again. Would she be widowed before 
her marriage, all because a certain 
captain’s orders meant more to him 
than his common sense? 

It was uncanny, the way in which 
the young man had divined the 
moves and kept up with a game the 
captain had never advertised. But this 
was a private game. He swept the 
pieces into the box, folded the board. 
Beneath it was a paper, previously 
hidden. Shetland picked it up and 
saw a series of notations. They seem- 
ed to represent the strategy of a 
game in progress. His game? 

He applied the notes to the game 
in his mind. They checked. But the 
moves were not as he would have 
made them. They started at the pres- 
ent position, but the style was radi- 
cally different. Beeton had said he 
could win with White — and these 
notes, incredibly, proved it. Begin- 
ning with a highly questionable 
queen sacrifice. White forged to a 
forced advantage in the game’s thir- 
tieth move. The series violated many 
of the tenets of good positional play 
— yet, he saw now, was quite valid. 



He would not use it, of course; 
the genius was not rightfully his. 
But he would show this interesting 
lesson to Sonmanda: how indepen- 
dent and bold foresight could convert 
a certain loss into victory. Book play 
was not always valid. 

By the thirtieth move. 

Coincidence? 

Or a message that his stupidity 
had prevented Beeton from deliver- 
ing? Was it natural to assume that 
such a brilliant mind had been mis- 
taken, in the one case that counted? 
Or had the cartographer’s terrible 
fear been based on fact, not fancy 
— while the distortion merely pre- 
vented him from making himself 
sufficiently clear? 

Had Johns also, finally, respond- 
ed to the actual message, seen its 
validity? 

Assume, for the sake of argument, 
that Beeton had been right. That 
death did wait at the thirtieth hour. 
That the situation was hopeless be- 
cause the man in charge refused to 
deviate from the book, from his 
orders, no matter what. 

In chess, the answer had been a 
total revision of strategy. The book 
had to be thrown away. In life — 

The chessboard image in his mind 
faded into a figurative map of the 
universe. Galaxies of the steady state 
hurtled outward, born in the center 
as pawns, dying of old age at the 
rim as kings. 

’ And then, as it were, the pieces 
came to life. The pawns were babies, 
the kings old men. The board, which 
was the universe, became a city 
without buildings. The babies were 
born spontaneously in the center

IF 




and crawled busily in all directions. 
As they made their way outward they 
grew into children, and some had 
bishop’s hats and some had horse’s 
heads. Farther out they developed 
into men and women, and the men 
were castles and the women queens. 

Finally the old kings staggered to 
the rim to die. The size of this city 
was governed by the age of the in- 
habitants. Where they became too 
old to go out farther, the city ended. 
Most of them died at fifty moves. 
The rim was a desolate grave. There 
was no one to bury the bodies; where 
they fell, they lay, they rotted, and 
the white bones guarded the memory 
of what had been. 

Then, incredibly, a child appeared 
at the rim. By some freak it had by- 
passed age and entered the domain 
of death long before its time. A child 
named “Meg.” 

The ancient bones quivered with 
rage. No living thing should be al- 
lowed to desecrate the mighty grave- 
yard. The angry spirits gathered 
their forces, concentrated their ghast- 
ly energies, opened their ponderous 
jaws and said: 

“Captain! Captain!” 

It was Somnanda. Shetland shook 
himself awake to see the beacon 
room. The yellow light was rampag- 
ing again, and this time he himself 
was the cause. 

“Reverse the drive!” he shouted 
into the intercom. 

N ow it was 16.49 — but it was 
speed, not time. Once more the 
captain of the Meg II stood behind 
the pilot, pretending that nothing had 
happened. 



“Captain,” Johns said. “Captain 
— I want to say something.” 

What was there for this man to 
say? That he resented being gassed, 
then revived to learn that his assis- 
tant had reversed the drive at 29.34, 
on the orders of that same captain 
who had shot the pilot down for 
urging this? 

“Captain, I just wanted to apolo- 
gize. I don’t know what came over 
me. I never lost my head like that 
before. I don’t believe in ghosts. I 
just — somehow I couldn’t — what 
I mean is, you did the only thing you 
could do, and I can see that you 
were right all the time. I’m sorry I 
forgot.” 

Johns was apologizing for his own 
distortion, now that it had abated 
with the speed of the ship, and he 
was able to see it for what it was. 
A distortion that was not his own 
fault. 

“We were all a little on edge,” 
Shetland said, discovering that his 
dislike of the pilot was gone. Was 
there any point in trying to explain? 

16.36. Thirteen hours of decelera- 
tion, with the Meg II traveling at 
only a tenth its former speed with 
every hour that the clock subtracted. 
And still approaching a rendezvous 
of terror with fantastic velocity. 
Twenty-nine hours of deceleration 
would bring it to a halt in space, at 
almost the exact spot they would 
have passed in the thirtieth hour of 
acceleration. The exponential series 
that was the drive was a remarkable 
thing. 

16.34. Only when they came to a 
dead halt, relative to their starting 
point, could they release the drive 



THE GHOST GALAXIES 



113 





and apply the chemical maneuvering 
rockets, in order to turn the ship 
around and begin the home journey. 
Then back, accelerating once more 
to — 

Hell broke loose. 

The ship bucked violently, fling- 
ing Shetland to the far wall. Shoot- 
ing pains went through his left 
shoulder as another upheaval bounc- 
ed him on the floor. An agonized 
keening sounded in his ears, and a 
red fog clouded his brain, seeming 
to obscure all vision above the hori- 
zontal. Dimly he saw the pilot’s 
legs wrapped around the bolted-down 
stool; Johns, more alert than his cap- 
tain, had held his position. There 
was the smell of burning insulation 
in the air. 

“Cut the drive!” Shetland roared. 
He tried to stand up, but the heaving 



room brushed him aside. The clam- 
or of the suit-alert began; the hull 
had been pierced. 

“Captain,*’ Johns’ voice drifted 
back from a far distance. “We’re in 
FTL. We can’t—” 

“CUT THE DRIVE!” 

J ohns moved his hand, and mirac- 
ulously the ship was quiet. Shet- 
land lurched to his feet, heedless of 
the pain. 

The alarm had ceased. Someone 
must have repaired {he damage al- 
ready. That man would get a com- 
mendation ... his hands, of their 
owQ volition, groped for and found 
the archaic regulation fire extin- 
guisher, not obsolete after all, as 
smoke curled up from the panel. Sud- 
denly the unit was blasting noxious 
foam all over his boots. He turned 



114 




it, already feeling the biting cold; 
crystals of ice flew off like broken 
glass as he tramped toward the con- 
trol panel. 

“Stop, Captain!” Johns cried. “No 
need, no need. The power is off.” 

Shetland lowered the extinguisher. 
Now he had time to assess his in- 
juries. Pain, for the moment, was 
masked; it was there, but the enor- 
mity of it would only be felt later. 
He was surprised to discover no 
blood. He felt along his left arm, 
realizing that the trouble with the 
extinguisher had been due to his one- 
handed control. The left hand was 
useless, though there were no breaks. 

“Captain.” Why did he always 
drift into contemplation, even in a 
crisis? “Captain — ” the pilot’s voice 
was shocked. “The instruments are 
registering!” 

“That’s what they’re for,” Shet- 
land said shortly. 

“But we’re in FTL!” Johns, so 
capable in the crisis, was now falling 
apart. “The drive is off. The shield 
is down. Why aren’t we dead?” 

Shetland had understood the situ- 
ation the moment the ship bucked. 
But he was not certain he could ex- 
plain it to the pilot readily. Johns 
might have difficulty accepting the 
truth. 

“Do you 'believe in ghosts?” he 
inquired. 

Johns stiffened. He had already 
denied superstition. Shetland sympa- 
thized; but this was necessary. 

“No, sir,” the pilot said. 

“Look at your instruments,” Shet- 
land commanded. “Tell me what’s 
out there.” 

Johns looked. “We’re approaching 



an object of galactic scope at just 
under the speed of light. Approxi- 
mate mass — ” He faltered. 

“Go on. Pilot.” 

“Sir, I think the instrument is 
broken.” 

Shetland replied with deliberate 
cruelty. “Do I have to teach you ele- 
mentary navigation? Where ar^ the 
warning lights? You know the in- 
strument is not broken.”. 

“But it can’t be — ” 

“Don’t argue. What does it say?” 
Johns seemed to shrink inside him- 
self. His lips stretched to form the 
words his mind rejected. “It says — 
it says the galaxy we’re approaching 
has no mass.” 

Shetland smiled grimly. “I ask you 
again, do you believe in ghosts?” 

VII 

4 4"^^es, there is a ghost,” Shetland 
. I said, as the Meg IPs hull vi- 
brated to the impact of her chemical 
propulsion. She was maneuvering for 
a position to begin the return voyage. 

The four of them were in the 
beacon room again, watching the 
steady flame. “All of us had some 
hint of the truth,” Shetland said, 
“but we were blinded by our sepa- 
rate conceptions of the mission and 
by our mutual dread of the unknown. 
We tried to exclude the supernatu- 
ral — not realizing that when the 
supernatural is understood, it be- 
comes natural. Cartographer Beeton 
was closest to it — ” 

“But I wasn’t able to face emo- 
tionally what my intellect showed 
me,” Beeton said. “The thing is so 
incredible — ” 



THE GHOST GALAXIES 



115 




“I still don’t follow you,” Johns 
protested. “We’re alive, and there’s 
a — a thing out there. I’ll admit that 
much. But nothing in the universe 
is solid enough to rock a ship in 
high FTL, and xwe were at 16.34. 
That’s a light-year per second! But 
we were battered so badly that a 
crate of beans broke loose and shov- 
ed itself through the hull. Or tried 
to.” He laughed. “Wouldn’t that be 
an epitaph for a lost ship: torpedoed 
by a can of beans in I^L!” 

“I, too, am perplexed,” Somnanda 
said. “I understood that it was cer- 
tain destruction to drop the shield 
while in FTL. Solid matter can not 
exist at a light-year per second.” 
“We phased in with the ghost,” 
Shetland said. “Beeton, things are 
dearer. Finish your explanation.” 
Beeton plunged in happily. “As I 
was trying to say at an earlier occa- 
sion, but somehow couldn’t quite put 
into sensible words: At the center of 
things, a galaxy is young. But in the 
course of fifty billion years or so it 
ages, and like an aging man it 
changes. For one thing, it puts on 
weight, becomes sluggish. A galaxy 
in its late prime is an unbelievably 
massive thing — so dense that its 
surface gravity prevents its own light 
from escaping. Within it, neverthe- 
less, breakdown continues, and the 
prisoned energies — well, we have 
had no experience with such a state. 

“Eventually all matter is gone — 
but there is still no escape for that 
phenomenal complex of energy. We 
are left with a galaxy whose material 
portion has passed away, but which 
still exists as an entity. A ghost.” 
“The ghost of a galaxy!” Johns 



said. “But that shouldn’t affect — ” 
“You forget that the ghost is mov- 
ing,” Shetland said. “That un-galaxy 
is traveling at rim-velocity: 16.04, 
ship’s clock. Since there is no oth- 
er — 

“Which means it determines stasis 
for this area of space!” Johns ex- 
claimed. “Velocity is meaningless in 
the void. It has to be relative to 
some mass, or — ” 

“Or some ghost,” Beeton put in. 
“Apparently our laws of physics 
change, here. We’ve discovered a lot 
more than a galaxy.” 

“So we decelerated to within light 
speed of the ghost, and the shield 
came down automatically, and left 
us in normal space. Even at the 
fringe, those energies were over- 
loading the drive — ” Johns paused. 
“But what would have happened if 
we had landed inside the ghost?” 
“Or even traveled through it in 
FTL,” Somnanda said. 

Shetland considered. “I suspect 
the nature of space itself is altered 
within the ghost. The Meg I did 
unwittingly enter it . .” 

T here was silence as the implica- 
tion sank in. Was this the final 
evidence that man was limited after 
all, in spite of his limitless ambition? 
Hemmed in by numberless and dead- 
ly ghosts ... or was their very exis- 
tence a new challenge, greater than 
any before? What would the first 
explorers find, when they parked 
their fleet and penetrated, carefully, 
the fringe of that monster? 
“Captain.” 

Shetland looked up. “Your move, 
Captain.” END

ENEMIES 
OF GREE 

by C. C. MacAPP 

Illustrated by MORROW 



The battle was between Mankind 
and the Slaves of Gree — until 
a third force entered the war! 



1 

T he Gree excavation team was 
too far out on the sand-flat for 
Steve Duke to see what they’d dug 
up, but the heavily-muscled Gjiss 
had stepped digging and were clus- 
tered around. The humanoid in 
charge — one of the equally stocky 
but less muscular Overseer race — 



had stepped into the small auxiliary 
ship, no doubt to report via visi- 
phone. 

Steve lowered the glasses, which 
weren’t much use anyway in this 
thick burbly air, and let his eyes 
rove. Safely above the Gree team 
(having learned their lesson) circled 
a pair of the huge leathery-winged 
creatures that seemed to be the plan- 



117 





et’s fiercest predators. Much nearer, 
only a few hundred out and below 
his spy-spot at the edge of the thorn- 
tangle, he could see five or six of 
the peculiar semi-intelligent red-fur- 
red beasts called ull-ulls, crouched 
in the thorny sheltered pathway 
they’d built from this hill-grove, 
across the sand-flat to the next. 

The Overseer emerged from the 
ship and gave orders to the Gjiss, 
who lined up and began passing 
something along from the shallow 
excavation. Steve tried the glasses 
again, but the morning was getting 
on and the air was too bumpy, so 
he settled for the guess that a skele- 
ton of some kind was being trans- 
ferred to the ship, bone by bone. 

Carefully (a man could fall, even 
in this low gravity, and impale him- 
self on giant thorns) he began pick- 
ing his way back into the tangle. A 
small flying mammal, with wings 
the size of his hands, hopped about 
him, chittering and showing its sharp 
little teeth. Other creatures hissed 
or snarled, but only in passing. This 
one seemed to have adopted him for 
its particular hate. 

Near his destination, a red-furred 
form moved from his path, retreat- 
ing just far enough so it could watch 
him through the tangled limbs. For 
perhaps the fiftieth time he paused 
and made little coughing sounds, but 
though the b^ast cocked it head at 
him and made soft replies, it would 
not come any closer. While he squat- 
ted there, the small flying thing dart- 
ed toward his hand as if it might 
actually bite. Annoyed, he made a 
half-hearted swipe at it. and it moved 
out of reach, chattering in rage. 



When he arrived at the chopped-out 
listening post, the flying nuisance 
turned and flitted away. It never 
followed him into the post. 

Fazzool, the B’lant, looked up 
from his radio receivers. Steve said, 
“I see your pet ull-ull’s hanging 
around again.” 

The gray-hided humanoid grinned 
as much as the thick skin and blunt 
features would permit. “It is you ze 
ull-ull likes. I zink it is a female.” 
Steve got out a large handkerchief 
and swabbed at his face. Here inside 
the tangle it was cooler, but more 
humid. “They dug up something out 
there. Anything on the radio?” 
“Yes. A skeleton — humanoid — 
and zere were civilized artifacts, Ze 
Overseer at zis end suggested zis was 
ze race zat brought ze ull-ulls to zis 
planet. Anozzer Overseer at ze ozzer 
end told him it was not zis one’s job 
to speculate about zat, and anyway 
what was it doing buried on ze sand- 
flat? Ze one at zis end said ze way 
ze flats get flooded every year, zat 
could happen accidentally.” 

Steve used the handkerchief again. 
“Well, that’s something, anyway. 
Where’s Ralph?” 

“Downstairs.” 

D ownstairs meant a hundred feet 
lower in the tangle, where Steve 
and his two companions had their 
meager cache of supplies and equip- 
ment. He found Ralph Parr — griz- 
zle-hearded, Earth-hom, a novice in 
space and in the anti-Gree forces, 
but no stranger to violence — check- 
ing power-packs in the laser wea- 
pons. Steve told him, “We’ll be busy 
tonight.” 



118 



IF 




“How so?” 

Steve said, “They’ve dug up some- 
thing I’ve got to get a look ait.” 

Parr finished with a gun and lean- 
ed it carefully in the fork of a limb. 
“Any change in plan?” 

“No. We’ll try it the way we work- 
ed it out. Meanwhile, I’m going to 
get some sleep, if I can.” 

II 

A fter sundown there was always 
a heavy dew, if not rain, but 
at least the temperature was bear- 
able. The three of them worked their 
way down to solid footing (if you 
could call a deep layer of old dead 
limbs solid), then moved cautiously 
toward an ull-ull tunnel they’d used 
before. From there it was a few hun- 
dred yards to the edge of the tangle, 
where the ull-ull pathway headed out 
across the flat. Steve peered out into 
the crude vaulted pathway, then led 
off. He blundered into a thorn; curs- 
ed softly. The tough-hided Fazzool 
chuckled. The ull-ull’s didn’t keep 
these pathways very clear. That car- 
ried an advantage, though — Gree 
patrols weren’t likely to use them. 

From behind and from ahead in 
the next tangle, came the beasts’ for- 
lorn-sounding cries, “Ull . Ull . .” 
It was fairly dark now. This planet 
had no moons, but a distant compan- 
ion of its sun was up, giving a little 
light. They reached the next tangle, 
and now it was really dark; but the 
tunnels were wider than the path- 
ways, so the going was no harder. 
Occasionally, besides the howling, 
there were the nervous coughs of 
nearby ull-ulls. Steve was used to the 



miusky smell of them and the damp 
smell of their fur, by now. He blun- 
dered into another thorn, but clamp- 
ed his mouth on a curse. Somewhere 
here this tunnel forked, and the 
wrong turn led right into the middle 
of ull-ull town . Here it was. He 
took the correct turn, and fifteen 
minutes later they reached the "edge 
of the second tangle. It was good to 
have even the faint light’ again. 

Before leaving the knoll he paus- 
ed, listening. Somewhere close, sev- 
eral ull-ulls where chewing on the 
viny growth. When they wanted a 
new tunnel, they simply ate one, at 
their leisure. He moved forward. 
There was no sound out on the flat 
except the faint sighing and grating 
of sand in the breeze. From here, the 
Gree camp was a glow in the foggy 
air. 

When they were fifty yards out in 
the pathway he heard a cough ahead 
and stopped. The dew felt suddenly 
clammy. He could make them out, 
vaguely; several big ull-ulls crouch- 
ed in the pathway staring toward 
him. A full-grown male ull-ull was 
close to eight feet tall, and it didn’t 
help much that a third of that was 
neck. They were almost bipeds — 
they could stand erect, or run, on 
their ludicrously stumpy legs — but 
their long gangling arms, or forelegs, 
reached the ground so that their 
spines were usually at about fifteen 
degrees from the vertical. They had 
an odd loping gait in this gravity 
(they’d evolved in a higher one) 
with their heads held high, swivel- 
ing as they peered about them. Run- 
ning seemed to be their natural first 
recourse. However, they’d fight when 



ENEMIES OF GREE 



119 




cornered or infuriated; and after all, 
this was their pathway. 

The leading one growled and took 
a few shuffling steps forward. 

Steve, gripping his pistol, swore 
under his breath. Even if a laser flash 
weren’t visible to the Gree camp, it 
would make a loud burst of static. 
He said softly, “Back up, slowly.” 
He himself retreated step by step. 
There hadn’t been time to study the 
beasts* habits much, but he coughed 
gently, trying to imitate them and 
sound conciliatory. 

They hesitated. He whispered to 
Fazzool, “Cut.” 

But already the B’lant was busy 
with a pruning tool. Seconds later, 
he appeared outside the pathway 
and moved up near the beasts to 
draw their attention. Steve heard 
Parr squeeze through, gasp and let 
loose a string of soft curses. Steve, 
the tension out of him, grinned, 
backed a few steps and eased through 
the opening, avoiding the thorn that 
had got Parr. 

As soon as he was out, the ull-ulls 
bobbed past. Two or three of them 
coughed at him, but there were no 
more growls. 

Fazzool had cut the hole on the 
side away from jthe Gree camp; prob- 
ably a good idea. Steve peered 
through the irregular latticework to- 
ward the glow. “Let’s get through 
and get started. We’ll have to crawl 
the last hundred yards or so.” 

Fazzool went back inside and cut 
at the other wall. Before they left, 
they rewove the lattice as well as 
they could, trying to hide cut ends, 
then started toward the glow. Now 
there were two dangers. One was 



low-flying Gree patrols; the other 
was the flying predators and what- 
ever else might rove the sand-flat. 
However, they got within a hundred 
yards of the camp without any trou- 
ble. Steve moved close to Fazzool. 
“Your stuff ready?” 

“Yes.” 

“Okay, then.” Steve glanced at 
his chronometer and watched the 
B’lant crawl away, making a wide 
circle of the camp, various bundles 
on his back. He felt better when he 
saw how well the drab, overalls 
blended into the sand and mist, a 
few yards away. Now he lay waiting, 
uncovering his luminous chronomet- 
er now and then just long enough to 
glance at it. 

The time finally arrived. He 
glanced at Parr and began to crawl 
toward the camp. 

T his wasn’t really a military camp. 

This planet — at the very tip of 
the galactic spiral arm along which 
the metal Gree-creatures had first in- 
vaded — was not only far from any 
strong region of Steve’s side, but was 
also worthless as either a base or a 
source of materials. In fact, Steve 
thought, if his superiors, the Effo- 
gan High Command, had known just 
how trivial Gree’s interest in the 
planet was, they probably wouldn’t 
have gone to the considerable trou- 
ble of landing him here. But they’d 
gotten a hint of something peculiar, 
and here he was. 

The inner perimeter of the camp 
consisted of about fifteen of the 
larger ships in a loose circle. Inside 
that, four transports served as bar- 
racks, messes and recreation halls. 



120 



IF 




Part of the area was devoted to park- 
ing for the small ships and aircars 
used on patrol or field trips. There 
was a cluster of temporary buildings 
that probably housed the archeolo- 
gical labs and equipment and a cou- 
ple of open recreation areas. 

A hundred yards outside the circle 
of ships was a fence. The expedition 
had taken a cue from the ull-ulls and 
cut twelve-foot lengths of the twisty, 
giant-thorned vine to form a stock- 
ade against predators. Sand mice had 
forsaken their usual scant diet of 
scrub-grass and flood debris to move 
into a thorny barricade and were 
gnawing loudly enough to mask a 
few slight noises. 

Sentries in pairs slouched around 
inside the fence, grousing listlessly 
about the dew, the guard-duty, the 
chow, the uselessness of this fool’s 
errand on this worthless planet. Most 
of them were Gjiss and spoke B’lant, 
because that was easier for them than 
English. The Gjiss weren’t exactly 
stupid, but they ran more to muscle 
than to quick wits, so there were 
B’lant and human sentries too. 

A loudspeaker grumbled some- 
where, announcing the change of 
guard. Steve squirmed out of the 
gray coverall, glanced to make sure 
Ralph Parr A^as doing likewise. They 
scooped sand over the garments and 
crawled close to the fence. The sen- 
tries had stopped pacing now and 
were waiting impatiently for their re- 
liefs. 

S omewhere beyond the camp one 
of the flying predators roared. 
There was a silence as all the sen- 
tries faced that way. Another roar. 



then an outburst of shrieks and bel- 
lows. Troopers scuttled -to the crude 
shelters of thom-vine scattered along 
the fence. Loud-speakers began chat- 
tering; crews ran for ships to man 
weapons. There was a real clamor 
now in the sky beyond the camp, as 
if all the flying meat-eaters on the 
planet were gathered in one big 
donnybrook. Steve saw Ralph Parr 
grin. A large part of- that noise was 
Fazzool’s taped records. To make it 
authentic, though, there were chunks 
of meat aloft, drifting with the wind, 
buoyed up by small grav units; and 
there really was some fighting going 
on. The creatures sounded as if they 
were tearing each other to pieces — 
without, Steve knew, actually inflict- 
ing more than a few gashes on each 
other. 

He got to a crude gate, fumbled 
for the fastenings, had to use his cut- 
ters. Searchlights atop the ships were 
slashing at the sky now, dimly pick- 
ing out twisting, circling forms in the 
mist. He and Parr tugged the gate 
open, got inside and closed it behind 
them, getting a few thornpricks in 
the process. Now the clamor was be- 
ginning to fall off as the meat was 
all gulped up, but predators were 
flapping overhead somewhere, pay- 
ing off a few last debts. Steve left 
Parr where they’d come in and join- 
ed the sentries going off duty, to- 
ward the open mess hall. He left 
them and walked boldly to one of 
the temporary buildings where a light 
showed. 

If he’d guessed right, a team ^ould 
be working on the skeleton dug up 
that day. 

He knocked. Presently the door 



ENEMIES OF GREE 



121 




opened. A B’lant Tech scowled out 
alt him, glanced at his Gunner Third 
insignia, and looked less truculent. 
“What is it you wish. Gunner?” 
Steve said in B’lant, “I hope I dis- 
turb nothing. I’m officer of the guard. 
After the excitement, I’m just dieck- 
ing around, and I saw the lights.” 
The humanoid’s blunt features re- 
laxed. “We are only finishing a rush 
job. Everything is all right.” 

Steve hid his elation. Now, with 
luck ... He made as if to leave. 
“Fine. I’m sorry I bothered you.” 
The Tech said, “You speak B’lant 
very well.” 

Steve turned back, smiling. “Thank 
you. I have been on Ypness, and 
Guntu, and Asbezzee. Rough worlds 
for a human, but magnificent.” 

Now the stiff B’lant smile appear- 
ed. “You have seen Guntu? That 
was my Hive world! Why don’t you 
— if it is possible — step in for a 
moment, eh, out of the drizzle? We 
are really sitting around drinking 
nazz and talking about this skeleton 
which puzzles us.” He stood aside 
invitingly. 

“Why, thank you.” Steve went in 
and let the Tech pour him a boiling 
bowl (in this atmospheric pressure, 
really hot) of the aromatic, peppery 
liquid. “Ah,” he said, sipping and 
pretending to enjoy it. “It’s been a 
long time.” He glanced at the bones 
assembled on the big table. “Is that 
what they diig up this morning?” 
“Yest” A Tech Third spoke up; 
no doubt in charge of the team. 
“Odd, eh? Note the elbow joints. It 
must have had unusual muscle ar- 
rangements for rigidity.” 

Steve looked. “Well ... I know 



very little about this business^ of 
course. But it looks like a Sabril 
skeleton to me.” 

it'^To, no,” the Tech Tliird said, 
moving to the table and Jab- 
bing with a forefinger. “The elbow 
was completely doublo-jointed. There 
is nothing to stop it Ending back- 
ward, see?” He looked thoughtful. 
“Althou^ you are right. Except for 
the arms, it is much like a Sabril. 
The peculiar shoulder-slope, and the 
lankiness . No; this could hardly 
be a deformity. But it is not too far 
to the Sabril region. Possibly we 
should look for an unnoticed varia- 
tion there.” 

Steve said, “I understand there 
was a weapon and some kind of 
communicator.” 

The Third nodded. “A simple ra- 
dio, worn at the waist. The weapon 
was a sidearm, a pellet-thrower, bas- 
ed on dhemical explosives. The pel- 
lets were all gone — peihaps fired 
at some predator that killed this 
humanoid. Anyway, the race must 
have had space travel, even if not 
the null, for this skeleton is no more 
indigenous to this planet than the 
ull-ulls.” 

Steve said, “I was watching a band 
of those the other day. They must 
be pretty intelligent, to build those 
pathways.” 

“We think not,” the Tech said. 
“We’ve tested them under incentive 
and drugs and torture, as well as 
observing them thoroughly in their 
natural environment. They can chop 
or strike with a handy stone or stick, 
but they do not even make the sim- 
plest tools or weapons. We are sure

IF 




the path-building is instinctual. Cer- 
tainly they’ve had a strong threat to 
meet in those flying things.” 

Steve said, “But I understood they 
hadn’t been here long.” 

“Fifty generations, perhaps,” the 
B’lant said, “equivalent to forty hu- 
manoid ones. Long enough, appar- 
ently. Or maybe they already had it 
on their home world.” 

“Oh,” Steve said. “Well, speaking 
of those flying predators, I had bet- 
ter get around and make sure they 
are not carrying away my sentries. 
Thank you very much for the nazz!* 

in 

T he sentries were still nervous and 
disorganized, which suited Steve 
fine. He reached Ralph Parr and 
found him talking to a pair of Gjiss. 
“Something wrong?” 

Parr said, “My partner hasn’t 
showed up.” He gave Steve a warn- 
ing look. 

Steve caught it. Something was 
wrong; he had to get rid of the Gjiss 
fast. “Well, don’t worry about it. He 
was probaibly manning a gun, and 
someone told him to stay on it. Is 
this your post?” 

Parr nodded. 

Steve asked the stocky Gjiss, “How 
about you?” 

One of them, a Tools Tech First, 
said, “We not know. I thought, here, 
but ... I guess the ones we should 
find, they already gone, and there 
are changes.” 

Steve said, “Yes. Well, just walk 
around the fence until you find an 
unmanned posit.” 

The Gjiss made a little bobbing 



motion of his head. “Yes, Gunner, 
we will do that.” 

As soon as they were gone, Parr 
inclined his head at the gate. He and 
Steve looked around, made sure no 
one was watching and shoved it out- 
ward. They got out and closed it 
quickly behind them. A few yards 
away, with sand hastily tossed over 
it, was the body of a man in a white 
Gree Slave uniform. Parr said in a 
low voice, “I had to do it. He saw 
that the gate bad been opened and 
demanded an explanation.” 

Steve swore softly, turned, and 
peered through the fence. No one 
looking this way. ‘Take his feet!” 

They got the corpse far enough 
away, threw sand over it and went 
back to fix the gate. There were 
ticklish moments as sentries walked 
by, but they got it rewired. Then 
they dug up their drab coveralls and 
got into them, spent ten minutes 
smoothing sand and sneaked away. 
They couldn’t do anything about 
their footprints except hope the driz- 
zle would obscure them enough. 
Then they lugged the body toward 
the ull-ull pathway they’d used. As 
they went, Steve asked, “How’d you 
do it?” 

“Slugged him, then put a knife 
under his ribs,” Parr said. “Damned 
lucky no one came by before I got 
him outside.” 

“Short-term luck,” Steve said sour- 
ly. “Well, we’ll have to make the 
best of it. God knows how soon 
they’ll match up stories and realize 
something’s fishy. And if they ever 
find enough of the body to see the 
knife wound . About here, I 
guess.” He dropped his end of the

IF 




corpse, then led the way toward the 
ull-ull path. When they were near he 
called softly, “Fazzool!” 

“Here!” They’d missed the hole 
by thirty yards. Fazzool came to 
meet them. “I smell blood! Is it — ” 
“Not ours,” Steve said shortly. 
“Tune up that recording of yours. 
We need some more help from the 
meat-eaters.” 

Fazzool turned on the tape. Steve 
watched the glow of the camp’s lights 
until they heard real predators over- 
head. When one swooped down after 
the Slave Gunner’s body, he said, 
“Let’s get back to the tangle. I’ve 
got to make sketches of that skeleton 
while it’s fresh in my mind.” 

W hen sketches and reports had 
been coded into a tiny message 
drone and nulled away to an Effogan 
outpost, Fazzool and Steve sat in the 
dark listening-post, talking. Fazzool 
said, “Suppose zey question ze B’lant 
Techs you talked to. Zose will surely 
remember zat you wore a Gunner 
Third insignia, while ze missing man 
is only a Second.” 

Steve sighed. He knew B’lant 
wouldn’t he wrong on such a detail 
and would know they weren’t wrong. 
“The chances are he was the real 
officer of the guard, since he was 
alone and /questioned Ralph. We’ll 
just have to hope the Overseers don’t 
make too much of the discrepancy. 
Anyway, there’s nothing we can do, 
so let’s not worry. Right now I’m 
puzzled about that skeleton.” 

Fazzool said, “I have been zinking 
about zat. If all ze bones were zere, 
zen ze humanoid was not killed by 
ze flying beasts. Maybe he drowned 



in ze winter, when ze flat was flood- 
ed and was covered wiz mud befo<re 
anyzing found him.” 

“Possibly,” Steve said. “But the 
pellet weapon indicates they didn’t 
have compact enough power units 
to build practical laser pistols, so 
they can’t have had null either. That 
means multiple-generation trips, at 
fractions of light-speed. So they 
wouldn’t be turning arophd and go- 
ing home. And if not, there ought 
to be at least a few old rusted hulls 
somewhere.” 

“Unless,” the B’lant said, “zey hid 
zem very carefully. Zey had reason 
to be furtive, wiz Gree already in 
zis whole part of ze galaxy.” 

“Well, probably,” Steve agreed. 
“Still, in the whole search Gree’s 
made here, there’s only the one 
skeleton been found, and a few other 
traces here and there. This is a liv- 
able planet for protein life. Where 
are their descendants?” 

“Maybe zere were no females 
along. Or ze ships could have been 
mostly automatic. Maybe what crew 
zere was just died of old age, wiz- 
zout descendants.” 

Steve said, “That just doesn’t feel 
right. Gree’s team has established 
that the ull-ulls were put down in a 
lot of different spots. Why would 
anyone stock a planet with an animal 
like the ull-ull, plus eight or ten 
smaller species, if he didn’t intend 
to move in? Why odd things like 
ull-ulls, anyway? There’s probably a 
clue there somewhere.” 

Fazzool said, “Why not for food? 
Ze ull-ulls and smaller zings zrive 
on zese vines. A whole world full 
of good pasturage.” 



ENEMIES OF GREE 



125 




The dark hid Steve’s grin. It was a 
standing joke that B’lant could, and 
with a little encouragement would, 
eat almost anything. “Possibly. But 
then what scared them off? And why 
hasn’t Gree been able to find their 
home world, if it’s only a slower- 
than-light trip from here? Even if 
some disaster hit them, a civilization 
dead such a short time would still 
show.” 

Fazzool was silent for a minute. 
“I begin to see what you mean. You 
zink ze skeleton is not representa- 
tive.” 

“Right,” Steve said. “Somebody 
else may have brought it here, along 
with the animals. Maybe the skeleton 
belonged to some sort of herder or 
watchman. And the somebody, who- 
ever it was, did have null. Then, for 
some reason — probably that they 
became aware of Gree — they went 
away again.” 

Ralph Parr, who’d just come up 
from the cache, cleared his throat 
for attention. “I’m afraid you’ll have 
to change the theory.” 

“Why?” 

“Because I’m sure that a couple of 
the guns aren’t quite exactly where I 
left them.” 

I f he hadn’t looked hard, Steve 
wouldn’t have noticed anything 
to support Parr’s claim. However, he 
found it. There were fresh Gree uni- 
forms and ‘other garments stored 
against possible need; and they 
weren’t refolded quite right. He 
called Fazzool. The B’lant looked 
and nodded. 

Parr said, “I’m not arguing against 
it, but how can you be sure?” 



“Remember,” Fazzool told him, 
“zat Steve and I were raised as Gree 
Slaves. Zere are ways you do certain 
zings, zat you would do in your 
sleep. No one who was not of ze 
Gree background would know zem.” 
Parr nodded. “Okay. I’m the same 
way about where I leave a weapon. 
So we know two things: that some- 
body searched this place and that it 
wasn’t Gree Slaves. Ull-ulls?*’ 

“No,” Steve said. “They haven’t 
the brains or the manual dexterity. 
Something else.” 

Fazzool said lightly, “It is a good 
zing we have Gree for ze common 
enemy. Ozzerwise, we might look 
like pincushions by now, wiz arrows 
or poison darts.” 

Steve told him, “I feel enough like 
a pincushion from these damned 
thorns. Well, they’ve had plenty of 
opportunity, so if they haven’t killed 
us yet, maybe they won’t before 
morning. I suggest we just put out 
the lights, bring a radio receiver 
down here, and wait until morning. 
Then we’d better wire up some better 
alarms, if we can. By the time we do 
that, we may have other things to 
ward off boredom.” 

IV 

B efore daybreak, it was obvious 
from the talk on the radio that 
the Gree camp now knew it was 
missing a man. Steve listened to the 
guarded talk. “At least they don’t 
suspect anyone else on the planet 
with radio. When they do, there’ll 
be a sudden silence, if I guess right; 
then, within a few minutes, they’ll 
resume broadcasting to fool us.”

IF 




They waited. Daylight started to 
filter into the tangle. Aboiit that time, 
a clamor of small creatures began 
somewhere not far away. “God,” 
Steve said, “what now? I guess we’d 
better go look, but keep your eyes 
open.” 

Before they reached the spot, they 
could see the reddish fur through the 
tangle. The small creatures — some 
picking at the ull-ull corpse, some 
just hopping around in excitement 
— set up a new clamor as the men 
approached. Steve’s particular little 
demon flew at him shrieking, to 
skitter about just out of reach. He 
made a vicious swipe at it, missed 
and clambered nearer the dead ull- 
ull to chase away the other things. 
Fazzool and Parr came up beside 
him to stare. Steve asked the B’lant, 
“Same one that’s been hanging 
around?” 

“I zink so. It is immature; about 
ze same size.” 

The thing’s throat had been tom 
open. Blood stained the more biick- 
ish red of the fur. Seen lifeless, it 
was a rather insignificant animal; 
bedraggled by the near rain, its long 
neck limp and weak looking. 

Steve moved back from it and 
raised his head to listen. “Something 
sounds different.” 

Fazzool §aid, “iZere are no ull-ulls 
close by. Zey are not too stupid to 
make ze association: ze one zat hung 
around us is killed. But why?” 

“My guess,” Steve said, “is that 
our visitors did it, either because it 
got in their way, or because they 
don’t want ull-uUs gathering around 
us. Let’s go look where that nearest 
family lived.”

It was a five-minute scramble 
through the thorns. The spot Steve 
had in mind was deserted. “Not 
even any fresh chewed vines. I guess 
we’re under a sort of interdiction.” 

W hat bothered Steve most was 
that none of their electronic 
alarms had been tripped. 

Of course those weren’t capable of 
detecting a tresspasser more than a 
few yards away — that would have 
required more power than he dared 
use, this close to the Gree camp — 
but they were spotted along the 
easy approaches and were well hid- 
den. Either the thing or things that 
had searched the cache were too 
small (or too insubstantial) to reg- 
ister, or they were scientifically so- 
phisticated enough to find and avoid 
the detectors. In all the galaxy, no 
race that was nonhumanoid, or 
much smaller than a man, had ever 
been found so far with more than 
brute intelligence. Of course there 
were the Gree entities, like three- 
foot metal cables with intelligence 
prograimmed into them, but they 
weren’t natural beings. And he didn’t 
want to think another race like that 
was loose. No, come to think of it, 
the searchers must have had hands, 
or something like them. 

“All right,” he said, half listening 
to an earplug that would keep tab on 
the Gree radio, “there’s an intelli- 
gent race here, with scientific under- 
standing if not actual technology, 
in complete hiding. They’ve hidden 
successfully from Gree, and we 
wouldn’t know about them either if 
they hadn’t made one or two very 
small mistakes. That’s one thing we 



have in our advantage. They don’t 
know we know about them. Unless 
they’re listening and understand 
English, which is pretty unlikely. 

We can’t leave without finding 
them. So, we invest whatever time 
we have in trying to flush them out.” 
Parr asked, “Just how much time 
do we have, and what are the odds?” 
Steve pondered. “Well, actually, 
the odds are rotten at any time be- 
fore the set rendezvous. Suppose we 
called a ship. It would take six or 
seven hours for it to get here. Half 
an hour to get down through atmos- 
phere; God knows how much longer 
to reach us. Say half an hour, with 
luck. Ten minutes for us to get 
aboard. Balance that against how 
long it would take the Gree expedi- 
tion to spot the ship as it came out 
of null, challenge it, radar-range it 
and get ships manned and aloft to 
clobber it.” 

Parr shook his head. “Even I can 
assess those odds. Why can’t the 
Birds null a big enough task force 
here to handle the Gree expedition? 
Aren’t we worth it?” 

Steve grinned. “The last point’s 
doubtful. Anyway, we’re right in 
Gree’s back yard, you know. A thing 
like that would escalate fast into a 
full-scale battle, and we couldn’t be- 
gin to match him here. Not to men- 
tion that we, and the planet, would 
get crisped. The rendezvous was sup- 
posed to be hit-and-run, and it can’t 
be moved up.” 

“So,” Parr said, “a few hours 
doesn’t make any difference, eh?” 
“Except for one thing,” Steve re- 
minded him. “Gree’s not looking for 
us now. He will be before long.” 



128 



IF 




Parr said, “I really cooked it when 
I killed that Gunner.” 

Steve shrugged. “You had no 
choice; and we haven’t any now. 
We’ve got to contact these hidden 
people, fast; that’s all.” 

Fazzool said, “Zat may not be 
easy to do. Zey are evidently pro- 
fessionals at hiding, and zey have no 
reason to trust us. Even if we let 
zem know we recognize zey are 
here, zey will avoid us. Zey will have 
to assume we might be frauds — Gree 
Slaves pretending ozzerwise, to draw 
zem out of hiding.” 

“That’s right,” Steve said, “but we 
don’t have to give them the choice.” 

P arr looked questioning. Steve 
grinned. “Just as a crude basic 
proposition, suppose we climbed to 
the top of this tangle — after letting 
them know for sure we knew they 
were around — and started waving a 
flag. Could they afford to let us fall 
into Gree’s hands?” 

Parr scratched at his beard. “I see 
the reasoning. But isn’t it based on a 
lot of suppositions and hopes?” 
Fazzool said, “I will listen gladly 
to a better reasoning. But I cannot 
zink of it myself.” 

“All right,” Steve said, “Fazzool, 
you know better than I do what we 
have along. »Can we send a radio 
beam — a weak one, but all over the 
spectrum — ^the oppK)site way from 
Gree’s camp? And swing it around 
an arc, to cover nearly a hundred 
eighty degrees?” 

The B’lant said, “Yes, we can do 
zat. But what if a Gree ship or air- 
car happens to be in ze way?” 

“Keep it narrow and aimed a little 



down, so it’ll be absorbed by the 
nearest tangles. Any bounce off the 
sand^at will -be weak and scram- 
bled until it sounds like static. Just 
send a simple pattern. Three dots, a 
pause, three more dots; something 
like that. Use your own judgment.” 

Fazzool pondered, nodding slow- 
ly. “All right. For how long shall 
I keep it up?” 

“Intermittently, for about half an 
hour,” Steve said. “Meanwhile I’m 
going out to that spy post. I’ll be 
back.” He started through the tangle, 
carrying a few small instruments 
and the field glasses. 

Halfway to the outpost he stopped. 
Something was missing . Oh — 
the small flying thing that had al- 
ways heckled him before. He wait- 
ed a minute, but it didn’t appear. 
He shrugged off a prickly feeling 
and went on. The creature couldn’t 
devote all its time to him — there 
was no reason to suppose it might 
not be somewhere attending to af- 
fairs of its own. 

He reached the outpost, saw that 
an excavation team was working at 
the same spot on the sand-flat, and 
squirmed himself into a passably 
comfortable position to watch. They 
were just digging around and prob- 
ing with metal detectors, apparently 
not finding anything. He had a small 
receiver with him now, and he lis- 
tened to the talk on the various 
Gree wavelengths. Things sounded 
all right. There was no mention of 
the missing man. Possibly about 
now, the B’lant archeologist Steve 
had talked to was giving his story to 
the Overseers and insisting he’d 
talked to someone in a Gunner Third 



ENtEMIES OF GREE 



129 




uniform. He used the glasses for a 
few minuites (the morning heat 
wasn’t burbling the air too much 
yet) and satisfied himself that noth- 
ing more was being dug up. 

It came to his mind suddenly that 
the skeleton and pellet-firing pistol 
might have been a deliberate plant. 
Maybe the hidden people had scat- 
ter^ a few such bones and artifacts 
about the planet, to disguise their 
own presence. He lowered the glass- 
es and squatted there, pondering. 
Assume a highly advanced race. Was 
it possible they maintained this 
planet as a sort of spy post against 
Gree and that their own strong- 
holds were far away, in remote parts 
of the galaxy? If so, they doubtless 
had other outposts and Imew about 
the Birds of Effogus; knew the Birds 
were resisting Gree. Why„ then, 
hadn’t they offered their help? 

Maybe they were too weak numer- 
ically and didn’t want to 'be swal- 
lowed up in a space war. Or maybe 
they just weren’t militarily inclined. 

All that was futile speculation. He 
had another look at the Gjiss team 
out on the flat, then put away the 
glasses and started back. 

Before he got there the Gree 
transmitters suddenly went off the 
air. 

V 

F azzool had discovered the same 
thing and wasn’t sending out his 
own beam any more. He looked at 
Steve expressionlessly. “I wonder if 
I attract^ zem.” 

“Probably not,” Steve said. “More 
likely someone just had a rushing of 



brains to the head. Let’s listen.” 
It was about five minutes lat^ 
that the transmission resumed. An 
Overseer’s voice explained smooth- 
ly, in English then in B’lant, on an 
all-station wavelength, “We have had 
a temporary power failure, but it is 
fixed now.” 

Steve grimaced. “That lights the 
fuse. Well, I’m tired of sitting any- 
how. Ralph down below?” 

“Yes.” 

Steve called out, “.Parr!” When 
the Terran came clambering up, 
Steve told him, “I think you’d better 
start making up three backpacks. 
Rations, guns, first aid, power units, 
grenades, about a dozen message- 
drones. Leave room for a few things 
Fazzool may decide we want. If 
we’re lucky enough to last till night, 
we may be playing hide-and-seek. 
Oh. Put in pencils and scratch pads.” 
Parr turned to start down, hesi- 
tated. “Scratch pads?” 

“Sure,” Steve said. “If we do find 
our secretive neighbors, we’ll want 
to communicate with them. Sketch- 
ing is the best way.” 

Parr left. Steve turned toward the 
center of the tangle, cupped his hands 
to his mouth, and began making ull- 
ull howls. He frowned at Fazzool’s 
grin. “If they’re listening, it’ll at 
least alert them.” He began to give 
the calls a pattern — three howls, a 
pause, three more. Fazzool said, 
“Zere will be Gree ships listening.” 
“I know,” Steve said curtly. 
“That’s why I’m doing this before 
they get here.” 

Presently he stopped, sat on a 
branch and thought. “Do you have 
any spare throat-radios up here?” 



130 



IF 




“Yes.” 

The B’lant went to a pouch hung 
from a thorn and brought back a 
small instrument on a strap. Steve 
took it and said, “I’ll be back.” 

He made his way to where the 
body of the dead ull-ull, now pretty 
much eaten by small things, still 
hung. He stood dangling the radio 
by the strap for a minute, pondering. 
No, there was nothing to identify it 
to Gree as Effogan technology. He 
glanced at his chronometer, listened 
for a few moments, then called not 
too loudly, “Here. Here. I have 
left something.” His listeners, if 
any, probably spoke no English, but 
his voice would be enough. He 
buckled the radio’s strap around a 
branch and left it hanging there, 
then retreated to the hideout. Faz- 
zool blinked at him. “You left ze 
radio in sight? What if Gree finds 
it first?” 

Steve said, “They’ll probably take 
their time with each tangle. They’ll 
put ships over the nearest ones, sur- 
round one at a time, and work their 
way into each. We’re closer to the 
edge than v/here I left that radio, so 
they’ll be here before they would 
find it anyway.” 

“Why will zey not simply drop 
gas bombs?” , 

Steve scowled. He should have 
thought of that. “Well, maybe they’ll 
think whoever they’re hunting may 
have masks. I’m going down to see 
how Ralph’s coming.” 

F ifteen minutes later, lugging two 
backpacks, he climbed back up, 
Ralph Parr behind him with the 
third. Steve asked Fazzool, “Can 



you drop youi* excess stuff into the 
tangle so it’ll take longer to find?” 

“I guess so,” Fazzool said, look- 
ing unhappy at having to junk so 
much excellent miniaturized equip- 
ment. “Are we starting already?” 

“I think we’d better,” Steve told 
him. “It may take a while to get our 
message across to our secretive 
friends.” 

They both looked at him oddly, 
but went to work junking the stuff 
Fazzool didn’t want to take. Steve 
joined them, tossing equipment off 
the crude platform, uncoupling it 
first when it was too bulky to fall 
through the tangle. “Damn!” he ex- 
claimed suddenly. “Did you put 
flashlights in the backpacks?” 

“Sure,” Parr said. 

Steve grunted in relief. His hunch- 
es were crystallizing now, and he 
knew what his plans were for the 
next hour or so. If they didn’t pan 
out . 

He looked around to mako^ sure 
nothing obvious was left. The plat- 
form, purposely, looked as if it might 
have been built by primitives. He 
walked around the edge, peering 
down to make sure nothing had 
lodged just below. He could see a 
few pieces of equipment, but only 
by looking hard. With luck, he’d gain 
a few minutes. He shrugged, reached 
for his backpack, fumbled in it for 
the flashlight, put that in a pocket 
and swung the pack to his shoulders. 
“Let’s go.” 

He led them down toward the 
nearest ull-ull tunnel and along that 
toward the center of the tangle. Af- 
ter a couple of hundred yards he 
stopped to listen. From various di- 



BNEMIES OF GREE 



131 




rections came faint sounds of the 
beasts. He wished he had directional 
sound pickups, settled instead for 
cupping hands to his ears and turn- 
ing this way and that. There seemed 
to be ull-ulls in every direction ex- 
cept the one from which they’d 
come. That wasn’t encouraging. If 
there were aliens in the tangle, the 
beasts ought to avoid them. The 
nervousness was in his veins now, 
making him tingle uncomfortably, 
making his hands feel numb. “Well,” 
he muttered and started on. 

Here the tunnel was about fifty 
feet above ground, but the center of 
the tangle, at the peak of the knoll, 
was on higher ground and might be 
about level with them. There was a 
good two hundred feet of vinery 
overhead, which made it dark down 
here. He was depending on that. 

The tunnel finally angled down to 
the ground. Now it was joined by 
others, convergent toward the center. 
Two red forms scuttled across be- 
fore them. There were coughs of 
Other unseen denizens. Steve mut- 
tered cursewords. A concentration 
of ull-ulls was the last thing he’d 
hoped to find. 

The ground leveled off, and he 
stopped. “Well . .” He aimed the 
flashlight at random, flashed three 
times, changed direction slightly, 
flashed again. He continued that 
around the circle and around again. 
After five minutes he stopped and 
waited. There was no sound except 
the coughing of ull-ulls and the chit- 
tering of smaller things. 

Fazzool, who’d rigged some equip- 
ment to wear on his person, said, 
“Zere is a Gree ship overhead.” 



S teve’s tension made him almost 
bark, “Well, that’s what we ex- 
pected, isn’t it?” He waited, forcing 
himself to stand still, listening for 
the sound of missiles falling. Gas 
bombs he could do nothing about. 
But maybe Gree wouldn’t want to 
warn possibly prepared quarry. May- 
be, even, there’d be a war of nerves, 
with the expedition troops waiting 
for the unknowns to fire a weapon, 
null a ship, show themselves some- 
how. 

Now Fazzool suddenly adjusted a 
plug he had in his left ear, put a 
hand over his other ear, and listened. 
He faced various directions. “Zere 
are troops coming into ze tangle. 
Not close yet, but working zere 
way in from all directions. At several 
levels, I zink.” 

Steve shrugged, wooden-faced. 
The expedition must have picked up 
something from this particular 
tangle, then. Maybe a faint bounce 
of that radio beam, just at the mo- 
ment when they were already sus- 
picious. Maybe, he thought, this was 
his last reckless gamble. He’d gam- 
bled on hunches often enough; was 
way overdue. 

He glanced at Parr. The man’s 
face showed neither fear nor re- 
sentment. He’d fight to the end, if 
he had any opportunity. So, of 
course, would Fazzool. Steve fin- 
gered his pistol, sickness growing in 
his middle. He’d sort of highhanded 
them into this, without explaining. 
“Well ... I guess I was wrong. 
Maybe we’d better find a thick spot 
and ambush as many as we can.” 
Nevertheless he waited a minute 
more, tried the flashlight routine one 



last time with no result. He breathed 
deeply to relieve the tension in his 
chest, clenched and unclenched his 
fists. He hated to give up on his 
hunch. Faintly, now, he could hear 
Gree’s Slave-troopers moving in. He 
looked toward a thick-grown spot. 
“There, I guess.” He took two steps. 

Suddenly he stopped. Like wraiths, 
a squad of ull-ulls — aiming heavy 
laser guns — stepped from the tangle. 

No! Not ull-ulls! The heads were 
slightly larger, the hands not quite 
so paw-like. The eyes gleamed with 
intelligence; with purpose. Suddenly 
he felt like giggling. “Drop your 
guns,” he told his companions in an 
unsteady voice. “We have to make 
it plain we’re willing prisoners.” He 
heard their weapons thud to the 
ground a second behind his own. He 
raised his hands shoulder-high, open, 
away from his body. 

The aliens eyed him steadily for 
a moment. Then one of them said 
something in a totally unfamiliar 
language and inclined his head in an 
unmistakable gesture. Steve, follow- 
ing it, turned and began to walk. 
Other aliens — all nude, but armed — 
came from concealment to lead them 
down the slope at an ungainly trot. 

Fazzool said in a bemused voice, 
“So zat is why ze ull-ulls are here. 
For camouflage.” 

Steve chuckled. “Yeah. Not to 
eat.” 

They reached a very thick growth 
of vine, and the aliens, except for a 
few still pointing weapons, went to 
work. Laser tools zipped through 
thick stalks until a way was cleared. 
Now they began tossing aside dead 
branches. 



ENEMIES OF GREE

I t was nothing so easy to find as a 
frequently used trapdoor. The 
hatch had laid buried ii^er authen- 
tic dead litter for years — ^maybe 
centuries. It screeched open. Steve 
and his companions were urged in. 
There was a ladder, of some rustless 
metal, and a dim orange light be- 
low. It took minutes for the whole 
party to get in and for the hatch to 
close above them. At the foot of the 
ladder, they hurried along a tunnel, 
around several turns, heading deep- 
er into the ground, then along a 
straight stretch. They must have gone 
for fifteen minutes before a mild ex- 
plosion sounded from behind. There 
was no pause in the trotting. A sec- 
ond mild explosion came, and now 
the red-furred aliens tensed a little. 
Another five minutes, perhaps — then 
a real blast went off. The floor of 
the tunnel heaved; metal groaned. 
Steve could hear the tunnel collaps- 
ing behind him. Fazzool, trotting 
beside Steve, said, “Not nuclear, I 
Zink.” 

“No, and only local.” Steve 
turned his head to look at their 
guards. “I’ve been wondering about 
thait. They’ll leave our hideout in- 
tact long enough for Gree to find 
and identify the stuff. Then, I’ll bet 
you, that whole knoll and what- 
ever’s under it will go up.” 

Parr said, “You mean, I hope, 
when we’re far enough away.” 

They weren’t there to find out, 
for^ithey entered a chamber contain- 
ing two small ships, looking fairly 
much like Gree scouts. Fazzool 
looked around. “No null tanks.” 
“No,” Steve said, “we’d hardly be 
likely to have picked a tangle that 



happened to have an incoming sta- 
tion under it. These have been here 
a long time, unused, waiting.** 

Parr said, “You mean you tWofc 
every knoll has an escape tunnel 
and ships under it?” 

“Tunnels, yes,” Steve told him, 
“ships, no. We’ve come quite a ways 
from our tangle.” 

“Huh.” Parr shook his head in 
wonder. “Do you really think Gree’ll 
be fooled very long? By our hide- 
out, I mean.” 

Steve made a gesture of dismissal. 
“I doubt it. But it won’t matter. 
Once we get these people in con- 
tact with the Birds, this planet can 
be written off.” 

They were urged into one of the 
ships. Hatches closed, and from var- 
ious activities Steve judged they 
were nulling. The three men sat un- 
der guard in the middle compartment 
of the ship — ^which, while not pre- 
cisely like a Gree ship of the same 
class, was too nearly so to be a co- 
incidence. This race had known Gree 
before, apparently. 

Presently an alien, clothed now in 
a white uniform, appeared. His long 
neck looked very odd sticking up 
from the jacket. He had a slate and 
stylus of some kind. First he drew a 
circle with lines radiating from it — 
a sun. Then he held up four fingers. 
A flick of his thumb cleared the 
slate. Now he drew a ship, sudden- 
ly made it disappear. 

Steve looked at Fazzool. “Null? 
Four days?** 

The B’lant nodded. “I zink zat is 
what he means.” 

Ralph Parr whistled. “That’s a 
long trip!” 



134 



IF 




Fazzool said, “I hope zey have 
something we can eat ozzer zan our 
rations.” 

The alien was watching them 
silently. Steve gestured for the slate 
and began the long, tedious job of 
establishing communication. 

VI 

W hen the null trip was up, he’d 
described the space war and 
tried, not quite successfully, he 
thought, to convince the aliens they 
could trust him and the Birds of 
Effogus. They told him very little in 
return — they were still being cau- 
tious — except that they were enemies 
of Gree. He had to wait until they 
spaced out before he understood. 
Then, cursing his own slow witted- 
ness, he stood with his two compan- 
ions and stared at viewscreens. 

The largest screen showed the en- 
tire galaxy. He’d been out far enough 
before to recognize it, but they were 
farther now, judging by the angle. 
He calculated, a little dazed. Four 
days. That planet’s day and night 
amounted to about thirty-one hours. 
A hundred twenty-plus hours of 
straight null . 

Another screen showed a cylin- 
drical object he didn’t grasp at first. 
Then, realizing the black background 
was starless space, he suddenly un- 
derstood the scale. At about the same 
instant, Fazzool gasped. “Zat zing — 
it must be a hundred rniles long, if 
ze angle of the viewer is normal. It 
is — not even from our own galaxy!” 
Parr, not grasping the enormity of 
it, said, “Huh? Wouldn’t that be an 
impossible trip even by null?” 



Steve stared at the image of the 
cylinder, turning slowly on its axis, 
crusted white with the ice of ages, 
pitted from deep-space debris. He 
let out his breath slowly. “Eight 
hundred Terran years,” he said to 
Parr, “from even the closest. God!” 
The alien who’d been working 
with Steve joined his hands and rest- 
ed his head on them in pantomime of 
sleeping. Fazzool said^ “Suspended 
animation for hundreds of years? 
Zey’ve solved zat?** He blinked in 
unbelief. “Even so — to send zat huge 
zing a zousand years, two zousand 
years, of null . zat is incompre- 
hensible! How would you store such 
energy? How would you conduct ze 
currents?” 

Steve mumbled something. He 
gestured for the slate, sat down, 
started to draw something, then 
looked helplessly at the alien. 

A few hours later he was explain- 
ing it to his companions as well 
as he understood it. “They came 
from the same galaxy the Gree crea- 
tures did. I hope it’s not a foretaste 
of what we*re in for. Gree had al- 
most won the war there, and the last 
coalition holding out began the des- 
perate project of a great Ark, to 
carry their kind of life to some new 
galaxy. They designed automatic 
equipment to revive them when they 
got close to one. Imagine the shock 
when they found Gree apparently 
had overrun this one too!” 

Parr said, “I can understand all 
that. But how can these be some of 
the original crew?” 

Steve said, “They’ve been waking 
each other up in relays. When one 



ENEMIES OF GREE 



135 




bunch got old, they came back to the 
Ark to die, and a young bunch took 
over. They had a long time to pre- 
pare that planet before Gree got cur- 
ious about it.” He grinned. “They 
say they nearly decided to kill the 
three of us and hide the bodies. The 
only reason they didn’t was that they 
had to know who was fighting 
Gree.” 

Parr asked, “What were they go- 
ing to do if they found Gree did con- 
trol the whole galaxy?” 

Steve told him, “They were scout- 
ing to make sure. That may explain 
a few strange drones that have been 
reported in this spiral arm. If things 
turned out bad, they were just going 
to land what flora and fauna they 
had on suitable planets, then throw 
themselves in a suicidal attack against 
Gree. They had no second choice. 
The Ark can’t null itself.” 

Fazzool said, “Zey made a big 
gamble. How could zey be sure zey 
would survive suspended animation 
after such a long time?” 

“They weren’t sure,” Steve said. 
“The Ark has automatic living en- 



vironments not only for animals 
such as the ull-ulls, but for their own 
races — there are several of them — 
in primitive cultures. They didn’t 
think they could maintain civilized 
cultures for so long without bizarre 
drifts; maybe even Gree worship. 
The launchers hoped that if the ones 
in suspended animation didn’t come 
out of it, some civilized race in some 
free galaxy would rescue the prim- 
itive cultures and the animals.” 

Parr shook his head in wonder. 
“It’s too much for me. Funny. 
There’s one thing sticks in my mind. 
I could like them except for that. 
The way they killed that half-friend- 
ly ull-ull. Seems they could have 
done what they want^ some other 
way.” 

Steve smiled wryly. The same 
thing had been on his own mind. 
“You have to balance that against 
something pretty big.” He stood up. 
“I’ve got to get my report coded and 
persuade these people to let me null 
it off. I’ve put off writing it as long 
as I can. I’m damned if I know quite 
how to begin.” END

by JAMES BLISH 



TRACK OF THE CAT 

T hat motionless, frightening, un- 
readable hieroglyph in the Mar- 
tian dust brought back into Dolph’s 
mind another sign that he had been 
trying — more or less successfully 
— to ignore for months: the func- 
tion of the sting in the arthropods’ 
tails. Had the thing not had sur- 
vival value for the animals, in pres- 
ent time, evolution would have 
selected against it, and no matter 
how useful it might have been in 
the past, today it would be gone or 
at best only vestigial. Progessive 
loss of structure with loss of func- 
tion is one of evolution’s firmest 
decrees — as witness the human 
vermiform appendix. 

“So it had to follow,” Dolph said 



Illustrated by MORROW 



They had broadcast an S.O.S. for 
help. Now someone — or some- 
thing — was answering their call! 



137 




What Has Gone Before — 

Teen-ager Dolph Haertel was attempting to discover the secret 
of anti-gravity. He had three things going for him — his intelligence; 
a family that encouraged research — and the fact that he didn't know 
it was impossible, in the orthodox view of relativistic science. And so 
he succeeded. He fitted out his tree house with an antigravity generator 
and propelled himself on a tryout expedition to Mars. 

But there his luck ran out. The basic power tube was damaged 
in landing. It was irreplaceable on Mars — and he had no way to get 
off Mars. Nor could Earth's much-vaunted space prograhis help him. 
Relying on chemical rockets, they were years behind schedule — worst 
of all, no one knew he had gone. 

Or almost no one. Dolph's nearest neighboring teen-ager back 
home — who happened to be a girl named Nanette — had been let 
into his secret, just a little bit — but enough so that, with what he had 
told her and what preliminary models he had left behind, she was able 
to follow him. 

] She did . and now there were two teen-agers stranded on 

MarsI They managed to stay alive, with the help of a strange lichen 
that made breathing a pleasure but not a necessity and a water-mine 
that uncovered drinkables under Mars's arid soil a few yards from their 
tree-house shack. Then — one morning — Dolph found a footprint by 
the water source. 

They were not alone on MarsI 



gloomily, “that there was — there 
is at least one animal on Mars larger 
than this invertebrate, that either 
hunts them, or that they hunt. Well, 
we can see that they don’t hunt any- 
thing larger than the lichen mites, 
themselves. And now we know the 
answer. We should have been mak- 
ing preparations against it long ago.” 
“What kind of preparations?” 
Nanette said, peering out the port- 
hole at the deceptively peaceful 



noon. “I don’t see any trees to make 
a palisade of, out there — or any 
water to run in a moat.” 

“I don’t know,” Dolph admitted. 
“Electrified wire, maybe, if I hadn’t 
used up most of the available stuff 
making that antenna for the jam- 
mer.” 

“I wouldn’t put any faith in any- 
thing that could be jumped over,” 
Nanette said. “How big do you 
think it is?” 



138 



IF 




‘^Bigger than the crustaceans. 
That’s as dose as 1 can come. If it 
were Earthly, 1 might make some 
guess by the size of the track, but 
we’ve got DO reason to think Che 
same proportional relationships ap^ 
ply here. Also, it’s a desert creature. 
It might be pretty small and still 
have a big foot to walk on sand with. 
Like the snowshoe rabbit — going 
from its track, you mi|ht think it 
was as big as a dog.” 

“Well, I’m going to think of this 
one as being about the size of a 
small elephant,” Nanette said. “That 
way, I won’t be upset if it turns out 
to be only as big as, say, a large 
rhinoceros. And now that we’ve 
settled that, just what are we going 
to do?” 

‘Trap it,” Dolph said. 

“Dolph Haertel, I know doggone 
well you were going to go too far 
sooner or later! And once you catch 
it, I suppose you’ll want to keep it 
in the lean-to!” 

“Well, it’s in the back yard al- 
ready,” Dolph pointed out with a 
wry grin. “And we’ve fed and water- 
ed it, so it’ll probably keep on com- 
ing back. There really doesn’t seem 
to be much left to do but give it a 
name. How about ‘Bertram*? Or 
‘Pywacket’?” 

“You’re impossible,” she said, for 
at least the fiftieth time. “All right, 
I give up. Why do we want to trap 
it, O Mighty Hunter?” 

“Well, to see what it looks like, 
for a starter. Though since wo 
thought to put the mine in sight of 
the porthole, I suppose all we need 
to do is keep a lookout early in the 
morning — it seems to come around 



at dawn, if we can go by today’s 
performance. But I don’t just want 
to look at the critter. If possible, I 
want to talk to it” 

44^^alk to iti But — oh, Dolph 
•L do you think it’s one of the 
Martians? I mean — somehow I 
hadn’t thought — 

“I know what you rnean^** he 
said soberly. “I thought it was )qst 
an animal at first too. After all» 
people that can build radio beacons 
don’t go about robbing traps. Or do 
they? We just don’t know. All we*ve 
got to go on, really, is one fact 
and one footprint. I don’t want a 
dangerous animal hanging around 
here, any more than you do, but 
there’s no way I know of to make 
it go away now — and frankly I 
don’t want it to go away unless and 
until I’m dead sure it isn*t a Mar- 
tian. Otherwise I did all that climb- 
ing around last month for nothing.” 

“All right. I can see that, I guess, 
even if I don’t have to like it. What 
are you going to use for bait? It 
doesn’t need to blunder into a trap 
to catch one of those lobster-things.” 

“No, I’m sure not,” he agreed. “I 
thought I’d try something a little 
more intellectual. If it hunts those 
crustaceans, maybe it’d like to have 
some sort of tool to get through the 
shells with — a knife, say. Even if 
it’s a Martian and he has knives 
and forks of his own, such a thing 
would show him that we*re intelli- 
gent.” 

“The house and the well show 
that.” 

“Hmm . that’s perfectly true. 
Well, what would you suggest? I 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



139 




don’t really want to trap him, phys- 
ically, anyhow — even trying that 
might be dangerous. I just want to 
attract his attention, and if the house 
and so on haven’t done that already, 
what would?” 

“Oh, in that case the knife ought 
to do nicely,” Nanette said prompt- 
ly. “The house and the well are just 
here, but the knife would obviously 
be a present. I mean, a gift. That’s 
entirely different.” 

“Well, it can’t do any harm to 
try,” Dolph said. “I hope.” 

D olph made the knife from 
scraps; he had no intention of 
giving away any of his imported, 
machine-made possessions, and he 
assumed that almost any assemblage 
of cut wood and smelted metal — 
especially the wood — would look 
strange on Mars, and perhaps uni- 
que. They put the tool inside the re- 
paired lobster trap, which was secur- 
ed in turn only by a simple latch, 
and set the whole lure out on the 
dusty ice at the bottom of the mine 
shaft. 

Whether or not the reasoning was 
sound, the knife was gone the next 
morning; and this time the trap, 
though left open, was unharmed. 
For his next bait, after some thought 
about what else might be both Mars- 
unique and useful the year round in 
a desert, Dolph put out a nine-foot 
length of clothesline. That, too, was 
taken . which was all well and 
good in its way, but they had yet to 
see the taker, which after all was the 
object of the proceedings. In what 
he decided would be his last attempt, 
Dolph now put out his canteen, with 



a chunk of ice rattling in it to show 
what it was for. That went, too, and 
on the fourth day he left the trap 
empty. Then he and Nanette settled 
at the porthole for a last vigil. 

The great dune-cat came to the 
shack in the first light of day and 
knocked on the door of the lean-to. 
He was carrying the knife and wear- 
ing the canteen slung around his 
waist by several turns of the rope. 
He would have been awe inspiring 
anywhere, but here, after so many 
months of isolation, he was fearsome; 
but these signs left no doubt that he 
was intelligent — a tool-using crea- 
ture — and no choice but to con- 
front him. 

Dolph got ready. He was frighten- 
ed almost speechless — but after all, 
he had invited this confrontation 
himself. There was no ducking out 
of it now. 

It was the creature’s size that was 
impressive first of all. Even in a 
quasi-sitting position, he stood a 
good six feet high at the shoulder. 
His coarse, shaggy fur — which 
was tawny, mottled in large patches 
the exact blue-green of the tumble- 
lichens — inevitably suggested a 
wild animal, but except for his leo- 
nine face and mane he really did not 
look much like a cat. His stance in 
the resting position was rather like 
that of a kangaroo, and his arms 
(or forelegs?) were almost as short 
in proportion to the rest of him, al- 
though a good deal more powerfully 
muscled. They terminated in true 
hands: five long, spatulate fingers 
and an opposable thumb. Dolph 
concluded that he had been resting 
on his knuckles when he had made 



140 



IF 




the prints in the sand, with the 
thumb folded inside the fist. Yet he 
did not look much like a kangaroo 
either, despite the presence — un- 
noticed by Dolph until later — of 
an abdominal pouch. For one thing, 
he had no tail. For another, the legs 
were obviously as well adapted to 
running as to leaping. 

But it was his eyes that, in the 
long run, made the deepest and most 
lasting impression. When fully open 
— for they could be covered inside 
the lids by nearly transparent shut- 
ters, like the nictitating membrane 
of a lizard or a bird — they were 
large, still and an incredible dark 
aquamarine, like the Martian sky at 
high noon. Meeting their steady gaze 
was an almost physical shock. Star- 
ing into them, Dolph could not help 
but be sure — despite the fact that 
the dune-cat was naked, except for 
the trappings which had come from 
Dolph himself — that he had indeed 
at last met an authentic Martian. 

Then the cat moved, very quietly 
and gently. One paw reached out 
toward Dolph’s head and unfolded 
its long fingers. The back of the 
hand was woolly, but the knuckles 
were bare and calloused. From the 
knobby tip of the central finger 
there emerged an inch-long claw, as 
curved and cruel as a saber. 

D olph stood still and sweated, 
listening to the thin sound of 
the wind and the abrasive whispering 
of the sand against his mask. He 
was as cold as he had ever been in 
his life. 

The sharp claw — why did this 
creature want, let alone need, a 



knife? — touched first one eyepiece 
of Dolph’s mask, and then the other: 
Tick . tick. Dolph stood fast, al- 
though the urge to flinch was almost 
more than he could bear. 

The paw went back to the cat’s 
tawny side, and then the other arm 
came up — the one bearing the 
knife. The blade probed for his 'eyes. 

Dolph would have broken and run 
then, except that he did* not dare to 
move. The great lynx-head bent 
down over him gravely, as though 
trying to decide what was the mat- 
ter with him. Then the knife, in turn, 
went tick . tick against the lenses 
of the goggles. Dolph felt his eyes 
trying to cross, and two scalding 
tears ran down on each side of his 
nose; but he fought to keep himself 
looking directly up at the cat’s 
sternly savage face. Somehow, he 
succeeded. 

The cat’s hand opened. The knife 
dropped into the sand between them, 
and the great beast stepped back. In 
a voice like a wind blowing over a 
thirty-two-foot organ pipe, it said: 
**Mmrreeornn-dmmannn.” 

Dolph tried to answer, but his 
mouth was completely dry. Helpless- 
ly, he raised his own hands and 
showed them, open, to the intent 
creature. 

Astonishingly, it nodded. “Dmnn,” 
it drummed inside its vast chest. 
“Dmmnnn.” 

“Mnn,” Dolph growled hesitantly, 
trying to make his voice as deep as 
possible. The result sounded absurdly 
thin to him; but the cat cocked his 
head, and the flattened, lynx-like 
ears tipped toward him, tufts quiver- 
ing gently in the aftermath of the 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



141 




morning sandstorm. Tentatively, 
Dolph tried it again, and this time 
managed to make a little more noise. 

The cat nodded again — although 
Dolph realized suddenly that he 
could not yet guess whether this 
spuriously familiar signal meant 
“Yes,” “No,” or “Look out!” De- 
ciding to be reassured for the time 
being, however, he turned slightly to 
beckon to the cabin porthole, behind 
which Nanette was waiting and 
watching. 

The long colloquy had begun. 

T he task of communicating with 
the dune-cat proved difficult in- 
deed. More than once Dolph thought 
with rueful envy of stories he had 
read in whidi the imaginary alien 
creatures had come pre-equipped 
with telepathy or a mechanical 
translator. This time, unfortunately, 
the job had to be done the hard way. 

At least, there was no shortage of 
cooperation. The cat left the camp 
each day before noon, but he was 
back each morning, just after the 
dawn sandstorm had ebbed. Early 
on, he showed a readiness to help 
with the physical labor — on one 
occasion supporting the shoring of 
the mine while Dolph replaced a 
timber, in a show of brute strength 
that was even greater than what' 
Dolph had suspected was in reserve 
beneath that smoothly rippling hide. 
He seemed, too, to understand the 
sinfple diagrams Dolph drew in the 
sand, although how far or how deep 
this understanding went was difficult 
to assess. 

The real problem, of course, was 
language. The dune-cat’s mouth and 



sound-producing organs were sim- 
ply incapable of producing the char- 
acteristic noises of the English 
language; it could shape only a few 
simple words and syllables, and 
those imperfectly and with obvious 
pain. Dolph, on the other hand, lack- 
ed both the length of vocal cord and 
the chest capacity to imitate the 
deep-throated grunts and growls 
which were natural to the cat, though 
he could manage a few of them well 
enough to make them understood. 
As a result, the “conversations” 
evolved gradually into a sort of pid- 
gin, in which isolated cat-groWls 
and English words were stitched to- 
gether imperfectly — if at all — 
with gestures. 

A ny attempt to reduce this di- 
alogue to the printed word 
could only have suggested that noth- 
ing at all was being communicated, 
and in fact what little information 
did pass among them was fairly 
primitive. But certain ideas did 
gradually become established. The 
dune-cat could manage “Dolph” 
quite well, although the “f” sound 
was rather slushy, and it applied the 
name indiscriminately to both of 
them. (Except for size, Dolph re- 
flected, they doubtless looked much 
alike anyhow in their masks.) 
“Dmmnnn” seemed to be its name 
for itself, which Dolph managed as 
“Dohmn”. If he pronounced the 
name with a forced, hollow boom, 
the cat responded at once. 

As for their origin, Dolph’s experi- 
ments with diagrams soon revealed 
— to his disappointment — that 
the cat had only the most rudimen- 



142 



IF 




tary knowledge of astronomy. His 
attempts to convey that he and 
Nanette had come from the blue- 
green star of Earth were met with 
flat incomprehension. After some 
weeks, Dohmn seemed to de- 
cide, rather dubiously, that they were 
visitors from Deimos, and Dolph let 
that pass for the time being. It was 
at least a step in the right direction. 

There were, it appeared, not many 
dune-cats. More than twelve, which 
was Dohmn’s unit of counting, but 
not many twelves more than twelve. 
Beautifully adapted to Mars though 
the creature seemed to be, Dolph 
wondered nevertheless whether it 
was in danger of becoming extinct. 
It allowed physical inspection of it- 
self with patient indulgence, and 
Dolph was fascinated to find that 
the greenish patches on its hide were 
not part of its fur, but a lichen with 
its fungal filaments deeply embedded 
in the skin. The vegetable stuff was 
not an infestation, but a commensal 
partner; it drew nourishment from 
the cat’s bloodstream, but it return- 
ed oxygen. The arrangement explain- 
ed how so big an animal could live 
in Mars’s oxygen-starved air, even 
given the benefits of the tumble- 
lichen ichor, on which the cat 
browsed sparingly about once a 
week. Its' staple food was the crus- 
taceans, which it killed with one sur- 
gical swipe of a paw. It hardly need- 
ed the knife, for the paws proved 
to be equipped with saber-like claws 
quite like those of an Bairthly tiger, 
but more completely retractable. 
Nevertheless it learnt to use the 
knife quiddy and once dissected a 
crustacean for Dolph with all the 



skill of an anatomist, to show him 
where the females carried their eggs; 
these Dohmn in turn stowed in his 
pouch, apparently as rations for long 
trips. 

Ordinarily, the cat was migratory, 
following the summer up and down 
the planet. The oasis was one of its 
regular stops or feeding stations, and 
Dohmn was able to draw a more 
than passable map showing the lo- 
cations of the others. This Dolph 
copied carefully, though the session 
was a disappointment in another 
way: it revealed that Dohnm 

thought Mars was flat. The map 
placed considerable emphasis on an 
immense, wheel-shaped area which 
Dolph recognized as the ambiguous 
territory Earth astronomers had 
dubbed Lacus Solis — the Lake of 
the Sun. Why this was important to 
Dohmn, Dolph could not immediate- 
ly figure out. 

The map session also established 
that the cat had not come to the 
oasis in response to Dolph’s radio 
jamming and indeed was entirely im- 
aware of it. This did not prove that 
confreres of Dohmn’s might not or 
could not be producing the beacon 
signal all the same, but Dolph doubt- 
ed it. Dohmn seemed ignorant of 
elementary electricity, let alone 
radio. 

Nevertheless, he pressed this line 
of questioning as rapidly as possi- 
ble. Nanette was of enormous help 
as the subjects of the dialogue be- 
came more complex. She imitated 
the cat’s noises even more poorly 
than Dolph, since her voice was high- 
er; but ^e often understood what 
Dohnm was getting at long before 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



143 




Dolph did and could suggest ways 
of putting things in the limited com- 
mon vocabulary available when 
Dolph despaired of framing a ques- 
tion at all. 

T he day finally came, however, 
when they were able to put the 
problem to Dohmn with partial suc- 
cess. It was accomplished with a 
sand-diagram of the crater, on the 
edge of which Nanette drew a mark 
like a little sun. From this she drew 
two lines, 180° from each other, in 
the two directions from which the 
radio “>bea)Con” might be radiating 
and trailing out into dots in the sand. 
As she marked the dots, Nanette 
cupped her ears as if listening and 
made the questioning sound. 

Dohmn’s own ears, which he 
normally carried flattened along the 
back of his head, stood straight up, 
and he bounded away from the di- 
agram as if alarmed. 

When he came back, he quickly 
scrawled a huge circle around the 
drawing with his knife — his usual 
sign that he did not waqt the picture 
erased for a while. Then he charged 
up the side of the crater and van- 
ished, though it was a good hour be- 
fore his usual departure time. 

Dolph and Nanette waited — they 
could do nothing else — and after 
about- half an hour Dohmn was 
back. To ‘Dolph’s intense irritation, 
he was carrying the jammer. Dolph 
could only hope that he could per- 
suade the cat to put it back, for he 
did not relisih the thought of another 
climb. 

But Dohmn was not ready to 
listen to Dolph yet. Putting the 



machine down next to the sand dia- 
gram, he made three long bounds 
away from it. At each stop, he drew 
a sun; and at the last, his standard 
diagram of Lacus Solis. Then he re- 
turned for the jammer and, carrying 
it carefully, planted it firmly in the 
center of his new map. 

Now it was Dolph’s turn to be ex- 
cited. He drew a line from his own 
diagram to Dohmn’s; pointed to all 
three of them and then up and 
out of the crater; and at last, he 
pantomimed marching.' The dune- 
cat made the questioning noise and 
marked time in place, with a peculiar 
mincing gait which would have been 
funny in so huge a creature if its 
implications had not been so urgent. 
Dolph nodded. So did the cat. 

“Does that mean what I think it 
means?” Nanette said, almost whis- 
pering. 

“I sure hope so,” Dolph said. “I 
still can’t believe he knows what the 
jammer is for — but obviously he’s 
seen something like it before and 
is telling us where and how long a 
trip it is for him. Three days.” 

“And what’s more,” Nanette said, 
“he’s willing to take us there. Do 
we dare to try it?” 

“I don’t see how we’d dare not 
to,” Dolph said. “And with his help, 
we just might make it, too!” 

XIV 

WHEN DREAMERS DIE 

O nce they had become settled in 
their own minds that the im- 
mense trip needed to be undertaken, 
Dolph and Nanette felt daily under 



144 



IF 




greater and greater pressure to get 
it under way. The prospect of some- 
thing new, of some unknown but 
possibly drastic change in their cir- 
cumstances, made their ramshackle 
camp seem more and more squalid, 
the whole oasis feel more and more 
like a trap. 

Yet there was an enormous 
amount of work to be done before 
they dared to venture up and out 
onto the high desert. It seemed ob- 
vious that they must take with them 
every scrap of food, every drop of 
water and elixir and every drop of 
clothing and bedding that they could 
manage — all this, plus the battery, 
the binoculars, Dolph’s signal genera- 
tor, a tent, ail their iline and such 
minor items as maps and knives. 
The risk of gutting the camp had to 
be run, despite the very good possi- 
bility that the trip would prove fruit- 
less and they would need to return to 
the oasis and set up housekeeping as 
before. Yet it seemed equally obvious 
that they could not carry all this on 
their backs, even with Dohmn’s 
help. 

The only possible solution, Dolph 
finally decided, was a sledge, if 
Dohmn could be persuaded to help 
pull it. Nanette queried him with 
several quick sketches and stances, 
and the dune-cat assented. Then all 
that remained was to build it, but it 
was an emotional wrench to get 
started on the task, since it required 
demolishing the lean-to for lumber. 

When it was finished, the sledge 
was a toibogganlike platform seven 
feet long and two feet broad, with 
a canted prow and side rails. The 
rails would help in carrying it up 



the crater wall, as well as providing 
hand-grips for passengers later. Also 
for better portage, they distributed, 
the supplies and equipment equally 
throughout its length; they would 
reload everything on the trailing 
end when they reached the high 
desert. 

Next came the making of a har- 
ness and a horse collar for Dohmn 
— the latter to distribute the mass 
of the sledge evenly across his shoul- 
ders without cutting off his wind, 
on the assumption — which seemed 
likely — that he had a windpipe in 
the usual place. The dune-cat 
tolerated the fitting of these arrange- 
ments with what seemed to be good- 
humored curiosity, and Dolph sur- 
veyed the result with some pride. 

“Neat, if not gaudy,” Nanette 
agreed. 

“Did you know the Romans never 
thought of that gadget?” Dolph said. 
“So they never got half the work 
out of their oxen that they should 
have. No decent yoke was invented 
until the Middle Ages.” 

“Maybe that’s why the Romans 
needed so many slaves.” 

“That’s a thought. I don’t remem- 
ber Gibbon’s mentioning that, either. 
Now, is there anything around here 
we can make buckles with?” 

“I don’t think so. I know how to 
tie a sliding knot, though. And that 
reminds me. If we could make some 
kind of a shoulder pack for Dohmn, 
it would lighten the load on the 
sledge while we’re climbing the cra- 
ter.” 

“It wouldn’t lighten it for him,” 
Dolph pointed out, “since he’ll be 
helping to hoist the sledge up, too. 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



145 




But he looks like he could take it, 
and we could give him the pack 
afterward — he could probably find 
plenty of uses for it. Anyhow, it’s 
worth trying.” 

D espite the constant emotional 
pressure to be under way, they 
worked harder on the project than 
they had worked since their earliest 
days on Mars. Made a little morose, 
too, by the prospect of leaving what 
despite all hazards and discomforts 
they had come to think of as home, 
they were both convinced that they 
were bound to leave something cru- 
cial behind, whose absence would 
be discovered only after it was too 
late. Hence, despite their day-end 
exhaustion, they lost considerable 
sleep trying to decide in advance 
what that thing would be — since 



obviously the whole contents of the 
house could not be loaded onto the 
sledge. 

On the last day, Nanette firmly 
insisted that they do nothing at all. 
She invented a particularly prepos- 
terous story, about why a mouse, 
named Aelfrida flunked her Ph.D 
exam in Landscape Garbaging, spe- 
cifically to waste the time with. 
Doiph actually succeeded in falling 
asleep before the story ended, which 
was probably just as well, since Nan- 
ette didn’t have an ending for it. 

They started up the side of the 
crater after the dawn sandstorm. In 
their hearts, each wondered if they 
would ever come back; but the ques- 
tion remained unspoken. Behind 
them, the watery sunlight crawled 
down the terraces toward the empty 
and half-demolished house. 



<^ 4 / — • 



W ith the dune-cat’s help, the 
ascent took only a day, and 
they were able to launch their small 
expedition out onto the desert the 
next morning, 

Dohmn pulled the sledge. One hu- 
man being rode, the other walked 
alongside until he tired, after the 
example of Arctic expeditions they 
had seen pictured, long ago and on 
another world. The sledge glided al- 
most as easily over the fine sand and 
dust as it might have over snow, and 
the dune-cat never seemed - to tire. 

Dolph’s projected route proposed 
that a good three-quarters of the 
trip be made along the floor of a 
tributary of the mighty Thoth- 
Nepenthes Canal, which passed be- 
tween their own oasis and Arabia, 
and thence northeast toward Lacus 
Solis. On the map, the overland dis- 



tance had looked short enough to 
make reaching the canal bottom pos- 
sible by the second day; and in fact, 
they were halfway down the western 
side of that vast valley — a chasm 
which made the Grand Canyon look 
like a scratch on a windowpane in 
comparison — before night caught 
them. 

Desipite the higher air pressure at 
that distance below “sea” level, the 
night Was bitter beyond all imagin- 
ing. They would never have sur- 
vived it without the added warmth 
of the dune-cat, who slept sprawled 
across the mounds of sand they had 
buried themselves in, filling virtually 
all the rest of the tent space. This 
innovation made Dolph nervous at 
first. He was reasonably sure of 
Dohmn’s good will, but after all the 
creature was obviously a superb kill- 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



147 



ing machine about which they really 
knew very little; but Nanette ac- 
cepted it readily and even with some 
pleasure, as though the alien mons- 
ter were some sort of gigantic Ted- 
dy Bear. Whatever the risks, they 
could hardly have done without him, 
and they got through the night both 
unfrozen and uneaten. 

The floor of the canal was warm 
by Martian standards, and a heavy 
carpet of tumble-lichen made the 
going harder for the sledge. This 
was compensated for to some extent, 
however, by the fact that down here 
they were once more able to dig for 
ice when they needed it. Dohmn 
took care of that task, in a great 
fountain of sand which took him 
down to the aquasphere in one fur- 
ious five-minute flurry. 

Paradoxically, the sound of the 
beacon in the earphones was dimmer 
in the canal. Dolph could only hope 
that some new shielding factor, per- 
haps a heavy deposit of iron ore in 
the canal walls, was responsible. On 
the third day, he was worried enough 
to ask Dohmn if they were indeed 
going in the right direction, although 
the compass said that they were. The 
dune-cat said so too, emphatically. 
Dolph let it rest at that — and sure 
enough, on the other side of an im- 
mense bend which they rounded on 
the fourth day the signal abruptly 
became loud and clear. 

T he fifth day saw the end. of the 
stores. Dohmn pulled them on 
regardless, and the sledge, now 
markedly lighter, almost skimmed 
over the sedgey valley floor. Their 
heads feeling afloat like balloons 



with hunger, Dolph and Nanette 
clung to the straps and tried to be- 
lieve that the dune-cat, now gallop- 
ing ahead of them completely out 
of control, still knew where he was 
going and why. The sledge rocked 
and bucked as the cat picked up 
speed; the moons scooted through 
the ink-blue sky; the signal became 
louder; the sand fountained away* 
behind them; the dust and the cold 
bit through thedr clothing* 

By noon, half delirious with thirst 
— for Dohmn still would not stop; 
he seemed truly to be running away 
with them, his heavy haunches 
pounding away at the smoking 
waves of rust with single-minded, 
almost mechanical ferocity — Dolph 
and Nanette were clinging to the 
rails and to each other. Spraying 
sand from under its tailboard, the 
sledge toboganned down into a nar- 
row col. Cliffs beetled above it, 
steadily shutting out more and more 
of the sky. 

Then, near dusk, the ool widened 
and debouched onto the Lake of 
the Sun. 

Dohmn slewed the sledge to a 
stop and sat down, his vast chest 
heaving evenly; Dolph could not re- 
member ever having noticed him 
breathing before. At his feet, the 
ground fell away toward a broad, 
almost circular plain, terraced with 
ringwalls to a flbor as flat as the 
center of a target. The lake itself 
stretched evenly out to the horizon, 
lightly dusted with rippled sand 
which fumed in a steady wind, from 
under which there shone forth oc- 
casionally a dull green gleam of com- 
pacted, ridged ice. 



148 



IF 




Here was a crater to end all cra- 
ters — as undamaged and regular 
as Plato on the Moon, yet bigger 
from side to side than the Moon’s 
Mare Imbrium. The unthinkably 
massive asteroid that had exploded 
this enormous well out of the crust 
of Mars must have hit very recently, 
as such events go in cosmic time, to 
produce so perfectly formed a wound 
and leave behind a genuine lake of 
open water, stripped from the deep 
aquasphere to be exposed to the arid 
air. 

Now, at last, the dune-cat allowed 
them to make camp and even took 
elaborate pains to help them. Re- 
lieving himself of his yoke, but with- 
out bothering to take off his pack, 
Dohmn promptly went hunting, re- 
turning before long With two of the 
iobster-creatures — one, the largest 
they had ever seen. A second ex- 
peition took longer and produced 
a cake of ice which on Earth would 
have weighed a good forty-five 
pounds; since the floor of the col 
was too far above the aquasphere 
to permit digging for such a thing, 
he must have had to cut and fetch 
it from the Lake itself. Then he 
pitched in to help dig a tent site and 
drive stakes. 

T his abrupt return to cooperation, 
even solicitude, was welcome 
enough, but Dolph could not help 
being made faintly uneasy by it. It 
reminded him disquietingly of a 
story he had once read, called “The 
Price of the Head,” in which a cast- 
away finds too late that the kindness 
of the natives is due to his position 
as the appointed sacrifice to their 



gods. He left the thought unvoiced, 
however; and in his advanced state 
of physical exhaustion, no thought 
could have been sufficient to keep 
him awake. 

In the morning, Dohmn was eager 
to be moving again, but this time 
without the sledge. Dolph and Nan- 
ette were just as pleased to be able 
to go without having to undertake 
another portage. Not that- it would 
have been difficult, for the terraces 
here were broad and shallow and 
not much weathered, strongly re- 
sembling a colossal staircase. Never- 
theless, the dune-cat did not take 
the most direct way down, but in- 
stead drew them off along the cir- 
cle toward the northeast, descending 
gradually as he went. 

By noon they had reached the 
level of the Lake and Dohnm’s 
apparent goal: a pair of intricately 
carved pillars at least twenty feet 
high, cut from the stone of the ring- 
wall. They flanked an open entrance 
into the cliff, of equal height and 
far too regular to be a natural cave. 
Dahmn went in promptly and then, 
finding that he was not followed, 
sat down on the smooth floor and 
made an imperative rumbling sound: 
“Dohwnn . dohwnn.” 

“Don’t rush us,” Dolph said, 
peering dubiously into the opening. 
“All right, so this is where we were 
going — but suddenly I’m in no 
hurry.” 

“Me either,” Nanette agreed. “It’s 
pitch black in there, after the sun- 
light gives out — and it slants down.” 

“There’s a turn just beyond where 
Dohmn is sitting, too. What do you 
make of these carvings, Nanette?” 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



149 




The girl studied the pillars. “Not 
very much. They’re pretty worn. 
They seem to be written in columns, 
like Chinese — or like numbers.” 
“Which doesn’t tell us anything, 
I’m afraid. We can’t even guess 
whether the characters are alphabet- 
letters or pictographs. But what I 
meant was, do you think somebody 
like Dohmn could have made them?” 
“N-n-no,” Nanette said slowly. 
“They’re too small. I don’t see how 
those big paws of his could have 
done such delicate work,” 

“I agree. So now we’re up against 
creature or creatures unknown. Do 
we take the chance?” 

Nanette contemplated the enigma- 
tic tunnel somberly. At last she said: 
“Well . whether we like it or not, 
isn’t this what we came to see.” 
Dolph donned the earphones and 
listened for a moment. The beacon 
was louder than it had ever been be- 
fore. 

“Fm afraid it is,” he said. “All 
right, Dohmn. Here we come.” 

T he darkness in the tunnel was 
absolute after the first turn. 
They could proceed only by holding 
onto the straps of the dune-cat’s 
pack. He seemed to be in no doubt 
about where he was going, however, 
and pressed ahead as rapidly as they 
could walk. 

The bend continued, modifying it- 
self gradually into a long smooth 
curve. After a while, Dolph was al- 
most sure that they were going back 
the way they had come — but on a 
much lower level, for the downward 
slant that Nanette had noticed was 
continuous. 



Shortly, the descent became steep- 
er. The floor of the tunnel was still 
smooth, which was fortunate, for in 
the blackness the slightest uregulari- 
ty would have caused a stumble. 
With nothing to see and no notion of 
what was ahead of them, the inhu- 
man, steady yowling in the ear- 
phones was almost too eerie to bear. 

Nor was it possible, deprived of 
the sun, to guess at the passage of 
time. Already it seemed as though 
they had been sinking ^ into the 
ground for hours. Curiously, the air 
around them did not seem to be cold- 
er; in fact, Dolph thought, the tem- 
perature had gone up a little. 

After another indefinitely long 
period, he was sure of it. On a ven- 
ture, he took off one glove and reach- 
ed out — very tentatively — for 
the nearer wall. He snatched his 
fingers back as soon as he encounter- 
ed it, but the expected searing flash 
of frostbite did not follow. The wall 
was far from warm, but he judged 
that its surface temperature could 
not be much below freezing. 

He realized suddenly that it had 
also felt abnormally smooth, almost 
silky; and rubbing his fingertips to- 
gether, he was astonished to find that 
they were wet. Donning the glove 
hastily, he stamped and listened to 
the quality of the sound. It was dis- 
tinctly changed. 

“\^at it is?” Nanette whispered, 
tugging at his belt. 

“The texture’s different, somehow. 
We’re not going through rock any 
more.” 

“What, then?” 

“I’m not sure, but I think it’s ice. 
And it’s warmer here.” 



150 



IF 




“Do you think we’re under the 
Lake?” 

“That’s my guess.” He slipped 
slightly and righted himself. “That’s 
ice underfoot, sure enough. I wish 
we had a light — now’d be our 
chance to find out how thick the 
aquasphere is.” 

“If we keep on going down like 
this,” Nanette said, “we’ll wind up 
under it.” 

“Yes, if the pressure doesn’t close 
the tunnel up first. There’s a warm 
draft here — wonder if that helps 
keep it open?” 

Dohmn growled slightly and 
tugged. 

“All right, all right.” 

Almost immediately, however, the 
tunnel walls began to retreat; and 
so — judging by the echoes — did 
its roof. While Dolph was still 
puzzling over what this might por- 
tend, his straining eyes detected a 
faint glow, seemingly in the very air 
around them at first, but brightening 
with each new step until they could 
see that it came from above. The 
first impression was that they had 
come out again, under a dim, over- 
cast sky; but that of course was im- 
possible. It was the roof that was 
glowing,, enormously far above them. 

“Oh, Dolph! Look!” 

He needed no urging. As they 
rounded a last bend, the ground 
sloped away before them, and at 
their feet there stretched out the 
dream-like ruins of a silent, entomb- 
ed city. 

O r was it waiting to be born? The 
air was warm, moist and thick, 
almost like an Earthly fog — and 



there was enough oxygen in it to 
breathe, for metabolisms slowed by 
the elixir. The city lay bathed in 
greenish-gray light, cast across it by 
the over-arching Lake, which con- 
centrated the distant weak sunlight 
like a lens. 

Dolph took off his mask and ear- 
phones and drew a deep, solemn 
breath. Nanette clung to his hand. 
The stillness was profoxmd and 
made all the more marked by a far- 
away trilling of running water . 
a sound so awesome on this dry little 
planet that it almost suggested some 
supernatural presence. 

The buildings of the city were tall, 
slender and widely spaced. Cut from 
some immemorial crystal which 
showed not the slightest age or wear, 
the transparent shapes towered like 
a convocation of thin ghosts — or 
like many droplets of topaz, balanced 
impossibly upon their narrow ends, 
their long facets unflashing in the 
even fill of the light. 

Do*hmn had stopped, standing 
erect, silent and motionless as a sta- 
tue. Inside the clear walls of the 
city, nothing moved; yet it did not 
seem dead. Here under all the sand 
and ice of Mars, it spoke silently 
for a deep-buried stratum of life — 
a biosphere, a sheltering place for 
whatever unknown powers had built 
this principality and might still rule 
it . 

The dune-cat made a soft sighing 
sound and, dropping back to all 
fours, padded away down a wide ave- 
nue — or was it a plaza? There was 
no time left to speculate or to sight- 
see; now that he was once more in 
motion, Dohmn went rapidly. It was 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



151 





152 



IF 




odd to see how much at home he 
seemed here, as though the city 
were only an extension of the silence 
of the desert. Here, however, the 
prosaic Earthly pack between his 
shoulders was ugly; it did not belong 
to this underworld of silent sky-high 
jewels. 

The doorless towers flowed by. 
Here and there, fugitive glitters and 
knots of light shone and vanished 
behind their clear dark sides, like 
the essences of machines also cut 
from crystal and remembered from 
a dream. 

Dolph lifted one earphone. The 
sound of the beacon still went on in- 
side it, insistent and unchanged, but 
somehow it did not seem disturbing 
any more. It reminded him, instead, 
of some long aria, like that song 
the Sirens sang in Homer. The stri- 
dent overtones which had sounded 
so inhuman before were still there, 
but now they were all too human 
— distortions of the pure melody in- 
troduced by the earphones them- 
selves. 

The avenue continued to broaden, 
as though the crystal towers were 
drawing aloofly away from the 
three little figures who were follow- 
ing that thread of song into their 
labyrinth. At the trail’s end, the ada- 
mant pavement swooped suddenly 
away from the level of the road into 
a great pool of light, where the lens 
of Lacus Solis came to a focus: a 
marble-white amphitheater, with a 
perfect paraboloid floor which re- 
flected the light back up against the 
icy sky in an almost solid-looking 
column. 

“Dohwnn,” Dohmn said. 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE

They went down carefully, cross- 
ing terraces which were too large 
to be steps, too small to be stone 
benches. At the very center of the 
depression there was another crystal 
structure, like a box set on end *on 
a stone dais; it was perhaps fifteen 
feet high. 

Inside it was a throne. Someone 
or something was seated on it. 

The figure was not easy to see, 
for the crystal case seemed to be fill- 
ed with some dimly sparkling fluid 
It wias itaM and not manMce, sug- 
gesting rather a serpent or worm 
with a cluster of six or eight small 
arms near the head end. On the 
whole, Dolph was just as glad he 
could see it no better. 

Then it spoke. 

T here was no visible motion of 
the figure in the case, but a 
deep voice rolled slowly through 
the amphitheater. Dolph guessed that 
it was amplified. It seemed to have 
no specific source. 

“You are the Earthmen,” it said 
in perfect English. “Our dune rover 
has done well: rrlr-ahmn-oh-ohrr, 
Dohnm. Please come closer, so my 
machines may sense you better.” 

The two stepped closer hesitantly. 
“Who are you?” Dolph said. 

“I no longer have a name,” the 
voice said. “You might well call me 
the one who sleeps. I am the last 
master of the city.” 

“How do you know who we are?” 
Dolph said. “And speak our lan- 
guage?” 

“Oh, as to language,” the sleeper 
said, “I know all Earthly languages, 
except for some minor dialects. All 



your radio broadcasts reach Mars 
plainly. As for yourselves, I heard 
your interference pattern and de- 
duced your presence, as I assume 
you had planned.” 

“Yes,” Dolph said. “We were 
hopbig somebody would eventually 
respond.” 

“Not possible. My signal is only a 
beacon and mechanical, intended to 
guide others of my race to this city. 
As you can see, we were a burrow- 
ing people. But today it se^es only 
as a life-signal, to announce that I 
am still alive. 

“1 have heard no other such for 
many years, so it is probahie that 
I am the last.” 

“Did you send Dohnm, then?” 
Nanette asked. 

“No, sir,” the sleeper said, re- 
vealing with that one word how great 
an information gap still existed be- 
tween itself and its visitors. “The 
dune rovers are free agents, though 
once they were to us rather as your 
dogs are to you. They are now the 
coming race here — provided of 
course that you will help them, as 
one creature of light to another. I 
so charge you.” 

“We’re not doing too well at help- 
ing ourselves at the moment,” Dolph 
said. 

“That will change. After all, you 
are only the first of many men. 
Quarry our cities for whatever is 
there that you may need. It is your 
inheritance ... I have waited a 
thousand of my years to bequeath 
it.” 

“Then you can’t help us now?” 
Nanette said. 

“No. My people are already dead, 



154 



IF 




or deep in dreams from which we 
shall not awaken any more. But 
your people are coming — indeed, 
are nearly above us now.” 

“What! But how — ” 

“They are on their way; I have 
heard them. We give you our world. 
Use it wdl and love &od guide our 
dohmnimi, who des^^ed the best 
from us.” 

“I hope we will,” Dolph said, 
shaken. “But we’re sort of a preda- 
tory race — ” 

“Yes, you are young. Otherwise 
you would not have managed to 
come here. But the dohmnimi are 
wise in their own half-savage way. 
If you abuse them, they will avoid 
you. If you seek their friendship, 
they will give you much. The choice 
is yours; but you will never wholly 
possess high and ancient Mars with- 
out their good will. They have al- 
ready offered you that, freely, when 
you were in most need of it. Will 
you forget?” 

“No,” Dolph said, “We won’t 
forget. I promise.” 

“Then my dream ends here. Go 
now. Your people are at hand. All 
Praise to That Which Dreams and 
never ceases; I can sleep now. Good- 
by, dohmn and men.” 

The voice ceased — and so, 
Dolph realized suddenly, did the sig- 
nal in the earphones. 

There was a long, terrible silence; 
and then, a low hoarse sound which 
Dolph would remember all his life. 
It was the funeral keening of the 
dune-cat, mourning the passing of 
old Mars. 

Overhead, the new Mars waited 
expectantly. 



XV 

PROJECT ARES 

Something had gone out of the 
^ dty when they passed back 
through it. The topaz flanks of the 
towers were dim and lusteiless, and 
there were no longer any lights be- 
hind them. Even the air seemed 
colder. 

On the surface, it was brilliant 
bluehlack night, not to from dawn. 
Had they really been underground 
that long? But obviously they had. 
Beyond the stone pillars, the dune- 
cat paused and looked up at the 
stars. Then, suddenly, he pointed. 

At first, Dolph thought he was in- 
dicating the racing spark of Phobos. 
While he watched it in puzsdement, 
he realized that Phobos should not 
be visible from this latitude at this 
hour — and at the same moment, 
the spark flared, briefly but brilli- 
antly, like a tiny candle. Behind it, 
two more flares licked out and died 
again. Nanette gasped. 

“Ships!” Dolph shouted. “Quick, 
quick — the beacon’s stopped — 
we’ve got to start our generator!” 

They scrambled wildly up the ter- 
races. By the time they reached 
their camp, the sparks were long 
vanished over the half-circumscrib- 
ed horizon. Dolph got his signal go- 
ing again with shaking hands — 
this time not to attract Martian at- 
tention, but Terrestial. 

Then they settled down to wait, 
wondering if they had dreamed 
everything that had happened since 
they had left their remote oasis — 
now almost cozy in memory, with 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



155 




the loss of any hope of help from 
the dead or dreaming Sleeper to get 
them back to it. Even the morning 
apparently was never going to come. 

But after a freezing eternity the 
sun shot up over the rim of the 
Lake with its customary abruptness 
— there was no real dawn on Mars, 
only an unceremonious blast of sun- 
light in a still-black sky — and the 
thin wind whirled the sand in spirals 
over the outspread ice. Still isbe- 
lieving, they watched the sky until 
their eyes ached and watered behind 
the masks. 

N anette saw the skiff first. It grew 
from a black dot low in the 
sky to a thing like a thin bat and 
then rapidly into a preposterous kite- 
like contraption with enormous, 
swept-back vanes which seemed only 
barely able to keep its needle-slim 
fuselage airborne. It came skimming 
down along the Lake to a seemingly 
certain crash and disappeared in a 
roaring ball of fire which plowed a 
deepening trench all the way across 
the ice to the near ringwall. 

When the fire went out, the skiffs 
sails were stripped and crumpled be- 
hind it like so many wadded news- 
papers abandoned in its track. Its 
body, however, was miraculously in- 
tact, though half imbedded in the 
surface of the Lake. 

“Oh, Delphi* How could anybody 
live through that?” 

“People are tough,” Dolph said, 
smiling tightly. “Let’s go see them. 

I think they’ll be surprised!” 

They descended the terraces again, 
with Dohnm loping easily behind. 
While they went down, the dart 



cooled with shrill squeaks of metal 
against ice, and after a while a bee- 
hive on its top turned around solemn- 
ly three times and fell off with a 
muted clang. 

A man in full space armor strug- 
gled out and slid clumsily down tc 
the Lake, wrestling with a U.N. flag 
on a long metal spread which kept 
trying to trip him; evidently he had 
not expected any such buffeting as 
the morning wind was giving him. 
When he was sure of his f opting, he 
planted the flag in the ice with a 
stab almost as angry as it was cere- 
monious. 

By the time he looked up again, 
the two ragged castaways and the 
mottled, spectacularly dangerous- 
looking dune-cat were grinning at 
him from a distance of only five or 
six yards. He simply froze inside his 
elaborate armor. Under his bubble 
helmet, his honest, craggy hero’s 
face was a study in disbelief and 
chagrin. 

Dolph stepped forward and held 
out his hand, pulling Nanette along 
with him. The spaceman retreated 
one elephantine step and then stood 
fast. 

Then his public-address box 
squawked and cleared its throat. 
“Are you — ” he said, “are you Miss 
Ford and Master Haertel?” 

Nanette laughed, which seemed to 
upset him even more, but Dolph 
said gravely: 

“Yes, we are. And this is Dohmn, 
the present Jeddak of Barsoom. Wel- 
come to Mars, Earthman!” 

The Earthman made a truly mem- 
orable answering speech. He said: 
“Ulp.” 



156 



IF 




O ne of the great ships of the Ares 
fleet came down the next day 
in a fury of smoke, sand and steam, 
in response to a terse call from the 
skiff, and Dolph and Nanette were 
taken aboard. 

The subsequent catechism was an 
involved one. Dolph could not re- 
member having been asked so many 
questions since he had taken his 
college board exams. Gradually, 
however, he and Nanette were able 
to piece together a picture of what 
had happened on Earth that had 
finally brought Project Ares here 
— finally, and yet far sooner than 
they had ever had any reason to ex- 
pect. 

Some of the story was political or 
diplomaitic and hence seemed likely 
to remain permanently unclear. 
Though the Gold War had long 
been over, the governmental habit 
of “security” had never been entire- 
ly extirpated. That part had some- 
thing to do with Dolph’s invention 
and with a complex maneuver by 
some corporation research director 
who had pressured NASA into try- 
ing for Mars far ahead of its cob- 
webbed schedule. Also involved, it 
appeared, was some adaptation of 
Dolph’s discovery which had led to 
a vastly improved form of ion-drive 
for spaceships — hence the un- 
precedented maneuverability of the 
rebuilt von Braun and her two sister 
ships; but this part of the story was 
especially unclear, since none of the 
vague references to the new drive 
suggested to Dolph that his anti- 
gravity principle was even under- 
stood, let alone contributory. 

The skiff pilot’s astonishment, on 



the other hand, proved to be en- 
tirely easy to understand. He had 
been told to more than half expect 
to find “the children” alive, for 
Dolph’s jamming signal and the 
Sleeper’s beacon had been heard 
aboard the von Braun while she was 
still six months away from planet- 
fall; but though the two signals had 
heterodyned into one, so that no 
source for the absurdly complicated 
noise could be plotted on a map of 
Mars, the expedition’s navigator and 
commander had gone on assuming 
that Dolph and Nanette — or which- 
ever of them might still be alive — 
were to be sou^t in the Sinus 
Sabaeus area for which Dolph’s 
charts had shown him to have set 
out. 

The sudden transformation of the 
signal into a simpler one, easily pin- 
pointed in Lacus Solis half a hemis- 
phere away from where Dolph and 
Nanette were supposed to be — and 
this, almost at the very moment that 
the three Ares ships were settling in- 
to their parking orbits around Mars 
— had baffled everyone, and there 
had been a sharp argument over 
whether or not to risk sacrificing the 
one-shot skiff (which had been de- 
signed for a long slow mapping 
sweep of the planet at a lower alti- 
tude than the three spaceships could 
maintain, not for a hot landing in- 
side a narrow boundary) to the hope 
of solving a mystery which close 
approach to Mars had made more 
mysterious than ever. 

But the decision had been made 
at last, for some reason which the 
von Braun^s officers would not ex- 
plain at all, but which made them 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



157 




snicker in stifled voices every time 
they thought of it, like so many chil- 
dren who knew where the Christ- 
mas presents were hidden and were 
having a hard time trying to look 
innocent. Every time that interesting 
secret was approached, the questions 
veered off into wholly expectable 
quizzing about Mars — and about 
Dohmn, who had evidently given the 
skiffs pilot a bad shock. 

Finally, Dolph cut off the ques- 
tioning himself. “Dohmn is all right. 
He’s been a big help, and I’m sorry 
I made a joke^ about him to begin 
with — I should have known it 
would just confuse everybody. He’s 
a member of the new ruling race 
here, that’s all, and a friend of ours. 
But look here. Captain — we’re glad 
to see you, of course, but — what is 
it you're keeping from us?" 

“Nothing to be alarmed about,” 
the skipper said hastily, but he could 
not quite stop smiling. “Just one 
more interview. We want you to talk 
to the mission’s bacteriologist.” 

“Do you think we’re carrying 
some sort of Martian mold?” Nan- 
ette demanded. “Why, we haven’t 
been sick a minute since we got 
here. Not sneezing sick, I mean. Just 
undernourished and things like that.” 
The commander laughed outright. 
“No, nothing like that. But it’s not 
up to me to explain. Lieutenant 
Gulliver, will you take our visitors 
to the xenology lab?” 

When the laboratory bulkhead 
swung back and Dolph and Nanette 
stepped through it, the last mystery 
explained itself. The expedition’s 
bacteriologist was Mrs. Haertel — 
Dolph’s mother. 



XTothing the least bit unpredicta- 
ble was said for quite a while; 
but after the first flurries of sur- 
prise and joy, Dolph found that he 
was feeling a little strange. His 
mother looked older than he had ex- 
pected and markedly thinner. He 
was reminded that these years must 
have brought her an ordeal of her 
own. 

It was Nanette, however, who first 
put the feeling into words. 

“We’re very sorry, Mrs. Haertel,” 
she said. “It was stupid and thought- 
less of us, shooting off like that and 
causing so much worry and trouble.” 

“It doesn’t matter now,’’ Mrs. 
Haertel said. “I knew all along that 
you were alive, somehow. You were 
a little hasty, but you were far from 
stupid — otherwise you wouldn’t 
have survived. I suppose the whole 
thing, bad and good, couldn’t have 
happened the way it did if you’d 
been older. Your various failures of 
foresight were just what anyone 
would expect from teen-agers — but 
on the other hand, once you were 
here, you saw direct, simple, unor- 
thodox solutions to a lot of your 
problems that would have escaped 
an adult completely, even an engi- 
neer, because his mind would have 
been too thoroughly set in the con- 
ventional grooves.” 

She smiled suddenly. “In fact, you 
got the fleet to Mars, between your 
precipitousness and Dolph’s discov- 
ery. Nobody your age had made so 
much history since the Children’s 
Crusade — and what you did was a 
lot more useful! It isn’t over yet, 
either. There’s that business of the 
elixir, which may be the one thing 



158 



IF 




that makes true colonization possible, 
that, and your dealings with the Old 
Martian, and much more — why, 
you’re the resident experts on the 
planet!” 

“We didn’t do much exploring,” 
Dolph said regretfully. “We 
couldn’t.” 

“No matter. You’ll probably be 
spending the rest of your lives lead- 
ing expeditions, now that we’ve got 
more equipment here. Unless, of 
course, you let us sidetrack you in- 
to being colonial governors or some 
other such administrative job.” Mrs. 
Haertel paused and looked at them 
critically. “Though there’s one over- 
sight we’d better repair right away, 
before the newspapers get hold of 
this story. You’d better get Captain 
Friedman to marry you, before he’s 
too busy to pin down about it.” 

Dolph shot a helpless glance at 
Nanette, but she only grinned im- 
pudently and offered no help. He 
said: 

“Married! Not that I’d mind — I 
mean, I think it’s a great idea if 
Nanette — that is, if you don’t think 
that — I mean, we’re not exactly — ” 

Nanette said, with the barest trace 
of malice, “/ think he thinks he’s 
too young. Besides, he hasn’t asked 
me yet. For all he knows, I might 
be much more interested in Dohmn.” 

“Dohmn?” 

“The dune-cat,” Dolph said, feel- 
ing that the conversation was now 
utterly out of control. 

“Oh, nonsense. Dolph, it’s a little 
late in the game for you to be gun- 
shy. If you doubt me, I’ve got a wit- 
ness. Look over there.” 

For some time, Dolph had been 

THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



marginally aware that there was 
someone else in the cabin: a tall 
man standing opposite him, behind 
his mother and well in the back- 
ground. Now, for the first time, he 
looked closely at the silent shape. 

H e saw a bearded figure, dressed 
like Nanette and himself in 
fresh green Space Force fatigues. 
His expression was hard to read be- 
hind aJl the whiskers, but his gaze 
was level and probing. Judging by 
his color and stance, he had spent 
many years out in hard weather; he 
looked lean and competent. 



“Anybody you know?” Mrs. 
Haertel said softly. 

“I don’t — ” Dolph started to say 
and then stopped, for as he spoke, 
the stranger spoke too. He said ex- 
actly the same words. 

He was, in fact, only a reflection 
in the polished metal of the von 
Braun*s hull. The tall man was 
Dolph himself. It had been that many 
years since he had seen a mirror. 

Dolph took Nanette’s hand and 
bowed solemnly to the image. 

“How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. 
Haertel,” he said solemnly. “And — 
welcome to Mars!” END

HUE 

AND 

CRY 



Dear Editor: 

I am writing this letter in answer 
to the question posed in your June 
editorial, viz, . bearing in mind 
that light itself has mass; it is de- 
flected by gravitational fields, just 
like an orbiting rock — what hap- 
pens w*hen light travels at light 
speeds?” Well, bearing in mind that 
I may not be at all qualified to write 
on this subject (I believe that I may 
be hopelessly out of date), I shall 
forge ahead. 

When I first read the above stated 
question, I thought, “Of course, how 
obvious. Light has a rest mass of 
zero!” But, heh heh, doubts began 
to slyly insinuate themselves. “Light 
is deflected by a gravitational field.” 
So I was forced (hating every min- 
ute of it) to go to my books. 

One of thd reasons for my trepi- 
dation was immediately apparent 
when I ran lacross a passage like 
this: “The energy of the photon is 
proportional to the frequency of the 
field. But energy of a particle is the 
time component of a four-vector 
with space components proportional 
to the momentum of the particle, 
and the frequency is the time com- 



ponent of a four-vector with space 
components proportional to the wave 
number (reciprocal of the wave 
length) of the wave.” (From Meth- 
ods of Theoretical Physics, by Morse 
and Feshbach, McGraw-Hill, 1953. 
Sounds like something Frank Her- 
bert might write, doesn't it?) 

There was one last recourse to 
easy truth. I tried to think of what 
my old physics professor might say. 
I visualized him as he was, a saintly 
old man, always on the verge of re- 
tirement, a kind of cross between 
Albert Einstein and Albert Sdiweit- 
zer — strong in his quest for truth! 
(You took that course too, eh?) I 
could see his lips moving, but I 
couldn't hear him. (He spoke softly 
and I sat in the back of the class.) 
Ah, well, back to the hard way. 

I think the easiest thing to do is 
to let the path .that a beam of light 
(a packet of photons) would take 
be a straight line. “That straight 
line's curved, professor.” “Back, 
dummkopf! That's a straight line!” 
So, then, “space must be curved” to 
account for this hypothesis. Is that 
so strange, though? We know of 
“bending of a “straight” path by 



161 




the movement of stars when the 
path is near the surface of the sun. 
Consider a sheet of some elastic sub- 
stance stretched out flat. Place a 
rather heavy object in the center of 
the «sheet. Now roll a ball so that it 
will pass near the center and fast 
enoug-h that it will reach the other 
side. The path of the ball is of 
course, curved. “But,” you say, “this 
is just an analogy to gravitation.” 
Yes, it is. That is exactly what it is. 
And the ball is a photon, a “bundle”* 
of “waves”. Well then, consider a 
light “massless” string laid out 
along the floor with a curve in it. 
Flip the end of the string to start 
a pulse moving. When th^ pulse 
reaches the curve, the peak of the 
pulse will lean out away from the 
direction of the curve! The pulse 
seems to be undergoing an accelera- 
tion ! It wants to move in a straight 
path I Well, the pulse is not under- 
going an acceleration; the pulse has 
no mass, and any mass a real string 
would have is simply going up and 
down. The seeming ac9eleration is 
due to forces pulling the pulses into 
a new line, but these forces act on 
a massless pulse. 

Suppose you plotted the path of 
the peak of the pulse as it moves 
along the curved path. Now bend 
the X axis so that it fits the curve 
of the string. A similar orientation 
of the Y axis will take care of the 
sloping of the pulse as it rounds the 
curve. You now have the pulse mov- 
ing in a “straight line”. 

You may attribute a “momentum” 
to this pulse; a momentum propor- 
tional to its energy where its energy 
is proportional to the frequency of 
the wave, but it must be remembered 
that in the case of the photon this 



momentum is a result of considera- 
tions of wave-particle duality. 

No, I can’t say what happens 
when light travels at light speed, 
and I don’t have any sort of posi- 
tive conviction that what I have 
just said is any where near the 
truth. I haven’t any idea what is 
meant by massless momentum; and 
I have the awful feeling that what 
I have just belabored is ridiculous.

# There we are, filled up tight for 
another month. Our “first” this 
month is The Empty Man by Gard- 
ner Raymond Dozois (whose writing 
time, for the next little while at 
least, will be preempted by other 
calls — he’s just entered the army). 
We do print one “first” story each 
issue, you know — which proves (a) 
that we do read all the unsolicited 
manuscripts submitted, because 
that’s where we find them, and (b) 
that writing science-fiction is not 
yet a dead art form! 

See you next month, when we’ll 
have a lineup that includes A. Bert- 
ram Chandler, J. T. McIntosh, Gor- 
don R. Dickson and (speaking of 
“firsts”) one of our most pleasing 
graduates from that status, Larry 
Niven, with the first in a group 
of stories (not exactly a series — 
they won’t all have the same char- 
acters, etc.) that we are pretty sure 
will be well liked indeed. It’s about 
a neutron star. You can tell that 
right away from the title — Neutron 
Star — and it’s that recent rarity, 
science fiction.

another way, there is nothing excep- 
tional about them. That’s because any 
man who will follow instructions and is 
willing to work at his own Duraclean 
business should be able to do as well 
under similar conditions. 

Each of the men quoted here had tal- 
ents and abilities different from those of 
alb the rest. But each had one thing in 
common — a desire to win personal inde- 
])endence in a business of his own. And 
each man took five identical steps to 
reach his goal. 

1. Each one read an announcement such 
as you are reading now. 2, He wrote 
for complete information. 3. He read the 
literature we sent him. 4. He gained 
new confidence in himself and the belief 
that he could succeed with Duraclean. 
5. He accepted our offer to help him get 
started. Later, he wrote to tell us about 
his success. 

In each case, remember, the first step 
was to write to Duraclean for informa- 
tion. If you would like to own a business 
of your own, why don’t you do as these 
men did — right now. 

When I hear from you, I will send you 
facts about the Duraclean Franchise 
that will open your eyes. You will see 
why a Franchise business such as ours 
makes success for the individual the rule 
rather than the exception. 



The Duraclean home service business 
has been tried and tested. The market 
for Duraclean Service is tremendous — 
and growing. The methods that lead to 
success have been clearly charted. When 
an ambitious man follows these meth- 
ods, success is the logical result. 

Some Franchise businesses require 
investments as high as $50,000. With 
ours, you can get started for a few hun- 
dred dollars and we finance the balance. 
Monthly payments are so small that the 
profits on less than one day’s service can 
cover your payment for the entire 
month. Even with this small investment 
and operating as a one man business, 
your potential is $250.00 a week net 
profit. With two men working for you 
35 hours a week, you should gross a 
profit of $420.00. Allowing 20% for 
advertising and incidentals, the net 
would amount to $336.00. 

The most imixirtant part of Duraclean 
home service is cleaning rugs,' carpets 
and upholstered furniture by a revolu- 
tionary modern process known as the 
“Absorption Method.” You do the 
work right in the customer’s premises. 
No harsh scrubbing with motor-driven 
brushes. No soaking. Instead, an aer- 
ated foam loosens the dirt and holds it 
in suspension until removed. A test con- 
ducted by an impartial laboratory 
showed that the modern Absorption 
Method removed twice as much dirt as 



was removed by old fashioned machine 
scrubbing. 

If you are tired of working for others 
or of jumping from one proposition to 
another — if you have a real yearning 
for independence in a business of your 
own— then send for “The Duraclean 
Route to Success.” There is no obliga- 
tion — no charge. No salesmen will call 
to high pressure you. Send for the book 
now. Read it. Then if you want to take 
the next step toward independence, you 
can write to me and let me give you the 
same help I’ve given so many other suc- 
cessful men.
