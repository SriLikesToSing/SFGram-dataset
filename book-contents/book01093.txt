OPPORTUNITY KNOCKED 



~ But No One Was Home 



^OUPLE months back, in the 
^ earliest stages of Seattle’s 
Century 21 World’s Fair, the 
management took notice of the 
fact that when you speak of Cen- 
tury 21 you are automatically 
speaking of science fiction, 
whether you know it or not, and 
scheduled a panel discussion on 
the subject. The principal guests 
were Ray Bradbury and Rod 
Serling. Since this was proposed 
as a full-scale kulturfest (admis- 
sion S2.75, put on in a hall that 
seats 3,000 people) we thought 
it worth your while and ours to 
ask Our Man in Seattle, F. M. 
Busby, to attend and relay the 
information. 

We did; he did; here is his 
report: 

The panel was eventually an- 
announced as Science Fiction, 
Ghosts and Freud in Novels, 



Television, Stage and Films in 
the Space Age. The moderator 
was Mr. William Kelley, West 
Coast editor for a book publish- 
ing firm. Mr. Kelley began by 
stating that he knew nothing 
about science fiction and did not 
know what he was doing here. 
The first panelist to be intro- 
duced was Mr. Lowell Hawley, 
Chief Writer for the Walt Disney 
Studios. Mr. Hawley began by 
stating that he knew nothing 
about science fiction and didn’t 
know what he was doing here; 
that made two honest men so 
far. (At this point a muted chorus 
was heard from scattered points 
in the crowd: “What are we do- 
ing here?” No answer was forth- 
coming.) It must be said for Mr. 
Hawley that he gave lucid an- 
swers concerning movies with 
which he was familiar, and that 
when he had nothing to say he 



4 



refrained from saying it When 
asked a general question along 
the lines of, “What do you think 
the future will be like?” Mr, 
Hawley stated that in his opinion, 
“People in the future will still 
be interested in the same basic 
things, though perhaps from a 
new perspective” ... a position 
hard to fault, and quite in keep- 
ing with the motif of the occasion. 

Next came the meat course. 
Mr. Ray Bradbury is an excel- 
lent speaker and a provocative 
thinker, and he was by no means 
having an off day. First he stirred 
up the animals with: “I know the 
least science of any science-fiction 
writer and I’m proud of it.” Ten- 
year-olds, he says, tell him: “You 
know that last story of yours? 
The way that spaceship in it 
works? UH-uh!” But, he says, he 
isn’t about to rewrite for ten- 
year-olds! 

Then he got down to business. 
The space age, he said, is the 
single most important step ever 
taken by mankind. The next fifty 
years will change the pattern of 
our lives more than did the Ren- 
aissance. The movement to space 
is “a religious movement in the 
truest sense of the world . 
Man will pass the gift of life on 
to other planets, and so will 
achieve continuity.” 

Mr. Rod Serling, the final 
member of the panel, is a very 
personable young man who has a 



warm way with an audience. He 
has not been around science fic- 
tion very long and is the first 
to admit it After discouraging 
his hearers with a standard 
“science fiction today is science 
tomorrow” gambit, Mr. Serling 
won them back by telling Mr. 
Bradbury: “You wrote this stuff 
and developed it before it be- 
came popular. Johnny-come-late- 
lies like me have a lot to thank 
you for.” Further than that, Mr. 
Serling displayed a fine, friendly 
touch for audience empathy and 
a familiarity with the science- 
fiction field comparable to Hugo 
Gernsback’s. In fact, Mr. Serling’s 
views of science fiction were very 
much in accord with those ex- 
pressed by Mr. Gemsback over 
many years, with emphasis on 
prophecy, education and inspira- 
tion of the reader. He was 
gratified to be able to say that 
science fiction is at last becom- 
ing “respectable.” Cheers did not 
drown him out, but his heart is 
obviously in the right place . 
namely inside his ribcage, where 
it’s safe. 

A FTER these opening remarks 
there was a sort of discussion 
among panelists and moderator, 
from which some (approximate! 
— taken by pencil in the dark) 
notes follow: 

Moderator'. What is there now 
to write about in science fiction? 



5 



Bradbury: The space age is 
only beginning. The distance to 
the sun is less than that from one 
ear to the other; this is what we 
will always be exploring. 

Serling: TV has not even 
scratched the surface. 

Hawley: Do you write to en- 
tertain — to educate — what’s 
your purpose? 

Mr. Serling allowed that en- 
tertainment is a package deal, 
which can educate or have a 
point of view ... or not. Mr. 
Bradbury cited Verne as inspir- 
ing inventions (submarine) and 
explorers (Admiral Byrd), and 
noted how space technology had 
come to involve religious matters, 
e.g.. Pope Pius XII officially ap- 
proving space travel in 1956. 

Bradbury: America is the most 
blasphemous nation in all history. 
We not only question the natural 
order of things, we change it and 
set it aside. ... I think that we are 
direct extrusions of God, who 
wants to perceive Himself 
through us. 

Moderator: What about cen- 
sorship in science fiction? 

Bradbury: You can get away 
with murder. Even in TV, with 
a purely science-fiction story you 
have very little interference. They 
don’t know what you’re talking 
about. 

Serling: Social commentary 

can go into science fiction that 
no one would dare to try straight. 



From the audience: Is man- 
kind prepared to go into space 
and meet nonhuman intelligences 
which might be housed in re- 
volting shapes? 

Bradbury: Humanity is a con- 
cept. It has nothing to do with 
appearance. 

Kelley: We’re not ready. Until 
we get this world straightened up, 
why go anywhere? . We are 
sick. Take an example of one of 
our jokes: “I have this Father 
Damien doll. You wind it up and 
set it on the table — and it 
rots.” 

Bradbury: We are never ready. 
We go anyway, as soon as we 
are able. 

With all due respect to Mr. 
Kelley and Mr. Hawley, it is in- 
teresting to speculate what the 
results might have been if Mr. 
Bradbury had been placed on a 
panel (at $2.75 a head admis- 
sion!) composed exclusively of 
people who knew what he was 
talking about. Mr. Serling showed 
up well for a self-admitted John- 
ny-come-lately . but consider- 
ing all the West Coast talent that 
could have been available, the 
heart drips green for the audience 
that expected four distinct and 
informed points of view of 
science fiction to be presented. 

Doubtless the producer was 
most sincere in feeling that a 
Disney writer and a book editor 
would draw the “general public”

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

into attendance to this crackpot 
“Science Fiction Panel” that he 
had somehow agreed to produce. 
They never seem to learn do 
they? — F. M. BUSBY 

T¥7ITH honorable, and rare, 
** exceptions . they never 
do. We agree to this with a cer- 
tain amount of emotion. One of 
the peripheral duties of a writer 
and/or editor is making an oc- 
casional public appearance via 
TV, radio, women’s club or PTA. 
We have often noted the embar- 
rassed half-smile which is the 
standard expression on the face 
of the program chairman or pro- 
gram host who doesn’t quite know 
what to say to, or about, these 
nuts who write this Buck Rogers 
stuff. You can see on his face 



what is passing through his mind: 
Obviously there must be some- 
thing about what this fellow does 
that will interest at least some of 
the audience, but what in the 
world can it be? So let’s play it 
safe. We’ll ask the six standard 
questions and crack the six stand- 
ard jokes . and by then maybe 
the program will be over. 

The trouble with science fiction 
(as we have said here in other 
connections) is that too many of 
its manifestations are under the 
control of people who don’t know 
anything about it. As aficanados 
know, it won’t fit a mold — 
especially not the Buck Rogers 
mold of dis-rays on Martian sea- 
bottoms. 

They never seem to learn, do 
they? — THE EDITOR

To begin 1963 we offer New Year's Greetings to another star-class 
wordsmith who has somehow evaded Go/ox/'s shanghai squads up to this 
time. The man's name is Brian W. Aldiss; the story, a novella entitled 
Com/c Inferno. In the same issue we have another novella, this one by Gordon 
R. Dickson — Home from the Shore — and at least one novelette, Cordwainer 
Smith's Think Blue, Count Two. Also shorts, features, Willy Ley — o full-sized 
portion of the best science-fiction reading we can find. 

Care to look a little farther ahead? Damon Knight returns in the 
following issue with a long complete story called The Visitor at the Zoo — 
after that, the beginning of a two-part serial by Jack Vance (remember The 
Dragon Masters?) called The Star King — after that . well, wait and see!

46^0ME on, Gussy,” Fay prod- 
^ ded quietly, *^quit stalking 
around like a neurotic bear and 
suggest something for my inven- 
tion team to work on. I enjoy 
visiting you and Daisy, but I 
can’t stay aboveground all night” 
“If being outside the shelters 
makes you nervous, don’t come 
around any more,” Gusterson 
told him, continuing to stalk. 
“Why doesn’t your invention 



team think of something to in- 
vent? Why don’t you? Hah!” In 
the “Hah!” lay triumphant con- 
demnation of a whole way of life. 

“We do,” Fay responded im- 
perturbably, “but a fresh view- 
point sometimes helps.” 

“I’ll say it does! Fay, you bur- 
glar, ni bet you’ve got twenty 
people like myself you milk for 
free ideas. First you irritate their 
bark and then you make the

rounds every so often to draw off 
the latex or the maple gloop.” 
Fay smiled. “It ought to please 
you that society still has a use 
for you outre inner-directed 
types. It takes something to make 
a junior executive stay above- 
ground after dark, when the mis- 
siles are on the prowl.” 

“Society can’t have much use 
for use or it’d pay us something ” 
Gusterson sourly asserted, star- 
ing blankly at the tankless TV 
and kicking it lightly as he 
passed on. 

“No, you’re wrong about that, 
Gussy. Money’s not the key goad 
with you inner-directeds. I got 
that straight from our Motiva- 
tions chief.” 

“Did he tell you what we 
should use instead to pay the gro- 
cer? A deep inner sense of 
achievement, maybe? Fay, why 
should I do any free thinking for 
Micro Systems?” 

“I’ll tell you why. Gussy. Sim- 
ply because you get a kick out of 
insulting us with sardonic ideas. 
If we take one of them seriously, 
you think we’re degrading our- 
selves, and that pleases you even 
more* Like making someone 
laugh at a lousy pun.” 

USTERSON held still in his 
roaming and grinned. “That 
the reason, huh? I suppose my 
suggestions would have to be 
something in the line of ul- 



tra-subminiaturized computers, 
where one sinister fine-etched 
molecule does the work of three 
big bumbling brain cells?” 

“Not necessarily. Micro Sys- 
tems is branching out. Wheel as 
free as a rogue star. But I’ll pass 
along to Promotion your one 
molecule-three brain cell spar- 
kler. It’s a slight exaggeration, 
but it’s catchy.” 

“I’ll have my kids watch your 
ads to see if you use it and then 
I’ll sue the whole underworld.” 
Gusterson frowned as he resumed 
his stalking. He stared puzzledly 
at the antique TV. “How about 
inventing a plutonium termite?” 
he said suddenly. “It would get 
rid of those stockpiles that are 
worrying you moles to death.” 
Fay grimaced noncommittally 
and cocked his head. 

“Well, then, how about a 
beauty mask? How about that, 
hey? I don’t mean one to repair 
a woman’s complexion, but one 
she’d wear all the time that’d 
make her look like a 17-year-old 
sexpot. That’d end her worries.” 
“Hey, that’s for me,” Daisy 
called from the kitchen. “I’ll 
make Gusterson suffer. I’ll make 
him crawl around on his hands 
and knees begging my immature 
favors.” 

“No, you won’t,” Gusterson 
called back. “You having a face 
like that would scare the kids. 
Better cancel that one. Fay. Half 



10 



GALAXY 



the adult race looking like Vina 
Vidarsson is too awful a 
thought.” 

“Yah, you’re just scared of 
making a million dollars,” Daisy 
jeered. 

“I sure am,” Gusterson said 
solemnly, scanning the fuzzy 
floor from one murky glass wall 
to the other, hesitating at the TV. 
“How about something homey 
now, like a flock of little prickly 
cylinders that roll around the 
floor collecting lint and flub? 
They’d work by electricity, or at 
a pinch cats could bat ’em 
around. Every so often they’d be 
automatically herded together 
and the lint cleaned off the 
bristles.” 

“No good,” Fay said. “There’s 
no lint underground and cats are 
verboten. And the aboveground 
market doesn’t amount to more 
moneywise than the state of 
Southern Illinois. Keep it 
grander. Gussy, and more im- 
practical — you can’t sell people 
merely useful ideas.” From his 
hassock in the center of the room 
he looked uneasily around. “Say, 
did that violet tone in the glass 
come from the high Cleveland 
hydrogen bomb or is it just age 
and ultraviolet, like desert glass?” 

44TVO, somebody’s grandfather 
liked it that color,” Guster- 
son informed him with happy 
bitterness. “I like it too — the 



glass, I mean, not the tint. People 
who live in glass houses can see 
the stars — especially when 
there’s a window-washing streak 
in their germ-plasm.” 

“Gussy, why don’t you move 
underground?” Fay asked, his 
voice taking on a missionary 
note. “It’s a lot easier living in 
one room, believe me. You don’t 
have to tramp from room to room 
hunting things.” 

“I like the exercise,” Gusterson 
said stoutly. 

“But I bet Daisy’d prefer it 
underground. And your kids 
wouldn’t have to explain why 
their father lives like a Red In- 
dian. Not to mention the safety 
factor and insurance savings and 
a crypt church within easy slide- 
walk distance. Incidentally, we 
see the stars all the time, better 
than you do — by repeater.” 

“Stars by repeater,” Gusterson 
murmured to the ceiling, pausing 
for God to comment. Then, “No, 
Fay, even if I could afford it — 
and stand it — I’m such a 
bad-luck Harry that just when 
I got us all safely stowed at 
the N minus 1 sublevel, the 
Soviets would discover an 
earthquake bomb that struck 
from below, and I’d have to fol- 
low everybody back to the tree- 
tops. Hey! How about bubble 
homes in orbit around earth? 
Micro Systems could subdivide 
the world’s most spacious suburb 



12 



GALAXY 



and all you moles could go ellips- 
ing. Space is as safe as there is: 
no air, no shock waves. Free fall’s 
the ultimate in restfulness — 
great health benefits. Commute 
by rocket — or better yet stay 
home and do all your business by 
TV-telephone, or by waldo if it 
were that sort of thing. Even pet 
your girl by remote control — 
she in her bubble, you in yours, 
whizzing through vacuum. Oh, 
damn - damn - damn - damn - 
DAMN!” 

He was glaring at the blank 
screen of the TV, his big hands 
clenching and unclenching. 

“Don’t let Fay give you apo- 
plexy — he’s not worth it,” Daisy 
said, sticking her trim head in 
from the kitchen, while Fay in- 
quired anxiously, “Gussy, what’s 
the matter?” 

“Nothing, you worm!” Guster- 
son roared, “Except that an hour 
ago I forgot to tune in on the only 
TV program I’ve wanted to hear 
this year — Finnegans Wake 
scored for English, Gaelic and 
brogue. Oh, damn-damn-DAMN!” 

“Too bad,” Fay said lightly. “I 
didn’t know they were releasing 
it on flat TV too.” 

64 Y|[/f^LL, they were! Some 
things are too damn big 
to keep completely underground. 
And I had to forget! I’m always 
doing it — I miss everything! 
Look here, you rat,” he blatted 



suddenly at Fay, shaking his 
finger under the latter’s chin, “I’ll 
tell you what you can have that 
ignorant team of yours invent. 
They can fix me up a mechanical 
secretary that I can feed orders 
into and that’ll remind me when 
the exact moment comes to listen 
to TV or phone somebody or 
mail in a story or write a letter 
or pick up a magazine or look at 
an eclipse or a new orbiting sta- 
tion or fetch the kids from school 
or buy Daisy a bunch of flowers 
or whatever it is. It’s got to be 
something that’s always with me, 
not something I have to go and 
consult or that I can get sick of 
and put down somewhere. And 
it’s got to remind me forcibly 
enough so that I take notice and 
don’t just shrug it aside, like I 
sometimes do even when Daisy 
reminds me of things. That’s 
what your stupid team can invent 
for me! If they do a good job, I’ll 
pay ’em as much as fifty dollars!” 

“That doesn’t sound like any- 
thing so very original to me,” Fay 
commented coolly, leaning back 
from the wagging finger. “I think 
all senior executives have some- 
thing of that sort At least, their 
secretary keeps some kind of 
file . .” 

“I’m not looking for something 
with spiked falsies and nylons up 
to the neck,” interjected Guster- 
son, whose ideas about secretaries 
were a trifle lurid. “I just want a 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



13 



mech reminder — that’s all!” 
“Well, I’ll keep the idea in 
mind,” Fay assured him, “along 
with the bubble homes and 
beauty masks. If we ever devel- 
op anything along those lines, I’ll 
let you know. If it’s a beauty 
mask, I’ll bring Daisy a pilot 
model — to use to scare strange 
kids.” He put his watch to his 
ear. “Good lord, I’m going to have 
to cut to make it underground be- 
fore the main doors close. Just 
ten minutes to Second Curfew! 
’By, Gus. ’By, Daze.” 

Two minutes later, living room 
lights out, they watched Fay’s 
foreshortened antlike figure scur- 
rying across the balding ill-lit 
park toward the nearest escala- 
tor. 

Gusterson said, “Weird to 
think of that big bright space- 
poor glamor basement stretching 
around everywhere underneath. 
Did you remind Smitty to put a 
new bulb in the elevator?” 

“The Smiths moved out this 
morning,” Daisy said tonelessly. 
“They went underneath.” 

“Like cockroaches,” Gusterson 
said. “Cockroaches leavin’ a 
sinkin’ apartment building. Next 
the ghosts’ll be retreatin’ to the 
shelters.” 

“Anyhow, from now on we’re 
our own janitors,” Daisy said. 

He nodded. “Just leaves three 
families besides us loyal to this 
glass death trap. Not countin’ 



ghosts.” He sighed. Then, “You 
like to move below, Daisy?” he 
asked softly, putting his arm 
lightly across her shoulders. “Get 
a woozy eyeful of the bright lights 
and all for a change? Be a rat for 
a while? Maybe we’re getting too 
old to be bats. I could scrounge 
me a company job and have a 
thinking closet all to myself and 
two secretaries with stainless 
steel breasts. Life’d be easier for 
you and a lot cleaner. And you’d 
sleep safer.” 

“That’s true,” she answered 
and paused. She ran her fingertip 
slowly across the murky glass, its 
violet tint barely perceptible 
against a cold dim light across 
the park. “But somehow,” she 
said, snaking her arm around his 
waist, “I don’t think I’d sleep 
happier — or one bit excited.” 

II 

^^HREE weeks later Fay, drop- 
ping in again, handed to Daisy 
the larger of the two rather small 
packages he was carrying. 

“It’s a so-called beauty mask,” 
he told her, “complete with wig, 
eyelashes, and wettable velvet 
lips. It even breathes — pinholed 
elastiskin with a static adherence- 
charge. But Micro Systems had 
nothing to do with it, thank God. 
Beauty Trix put it on the market 
ten days ago and it’s already 
started a teen-age craze. Some 



14 



GALAXY 



boys are wearing them too, and 
the police are yipping at Trix for 
encouraging transvestism with 
psychic repercussions.” 

“Didn’t I hear somewhere that 
Trix is a secret subsidiary of 
Micro?” Gusterson demanded, 
rearing up from his ancient elec- 
tric typewriter. “No, you’re not 
stopping me writing, Fay — it’s 
the gut of evening. If I do any 
more I won’t have any juice to 
start with tomorrow. I got an- 
other of my insanity thrillers 
moving. A real id-teaser. In this 
one not only all the characters 
are crazy but the robot psychia- 
trist too.” 

“The vending machines are 
jumping with insanity novels,” 
Fay commented. “Odd they’re so 
popular.” 

Gusterson chortled. “The only 
way you outer-directed moles 
will accept individuality any 
more even in a fictional charac- 
ter, without your superegos get- 
ting seasick, is for them to be 
crazy. Hey, Daisy! Lemme see 
that beauty mask!” 

But his wife, backing out of 
the room, hugged the package to 
her bosom and solemnly shook 
her head. 

“A hell of a thing,” Gusterson 
complained, “not even to be able 
to see what my stolen ideas look 
like.” 

“I got a present for you too,” 
Fay said. “Something you might 



think of as a royalty on all the 
inventions someone thought of a 
little ahead of you. Fifty dollars 
by your own evaluation.” He held 
out the smaller package. “Your 
tickler.” 

“My what?” Gusterson de- 
manded suspiciously. 

“Your tickler. The mech re- 
minder you wanted. It turns out 
that the file a secretary keeps to 
remind her boss to do certain 
things at certain times is called 
a tickler file. So we named this 
a tickler. Here.” 

Gusterson still didn’t touch the 
package. “You mean you actually 
put your invention team to work 
on that nonsense?" 

“Well, what do you think? 
Don’t be scared of it. Here, I’ll 
show you.” 

As he unwrapped the package. 
Fay said, “It hasn’t been decided 
yet whether we’ll manufacture it 
commercially. If we do. I’ll put 
through a voucher for you — for 
‘development consultation’ or 
something like that. Sorry no roy- 
alty’s possible. Davidson’s squad 
had started to work up the iden- 
tical idea three years ago, but it 
got shelved. I found it on a snoop 
through the closets. There! Looks 
rich, doesn’t it?” 

THE scarred black table- 
top was a dully gleaming 
silvery object about the size and 
shape of a cupped hand with fin-

gers merging. A tiny pellet on a 
short near-invisible wire led off 
from it. On the back was a punc- 
tured area suggesting the face of 
a microphone; there was also a 
window with a date and time in 
hours and minutes showing 
through and next to that four 
little buttons in a row. The con- 
cave underside of the silvery 
“hand” was smooth except for a 
central area where what looked 
like two little rollers came 
through. 

“It goes on your shoulder un- 
der your shirt,” Fay explained, 
“and you tuck the pellet in your 
ear. We might work up bone con- 
duction on a commercial model. 
Inside is an ultra-slow fine-wire 
recorder holding a spool that 
runs for a week. The clock lets 
you go to any place on the 7-day 
wire and record a message. The 
buttons give you variable speed 
in going there, so you don’t waste 
too much time making a setting. 
There’s a knack in fingering them 
efficiently, but it’s easily ac- 
quired.” 

Fay picked up the tickler. “For 
instance, suppose there’s a TV 
show you want to catch tomor- 
row night at twenty-two hun- 
dred.” He touched the buttons. 
There was the faintest whirring. 
The clock face blurred briefly 
three times before showing the 
setting he’d mentioned. Then Fay 
spoke into the punctured area: 



“Turn on TV Channel Two, you 
big dummy!” He grinned over at 
Gusterson. “When you’ve got all 
your instructions to yourself 
loaded in, you synchronize with 
the present moment and let her 
roll. Fit it on your shoulder and 
forget it. Oh, yes, and it literally 
does tickle you every time it de- 
livers an instruction. That’s what 
the little rollers are for. Believe 
me, you can’t ignore it. Come on. 
Gussy, take off your shirt and try 
it out. We’ll feed in some instruc- 
tions for the next ten minutes so 
you get the feel of how it works.” 

“I don’t want to,” Gusterson 
said. “Not right now. I want to 
sniff around it first. My God, it’s 
small! Besides everything else it 
does, does it think?” 

“Don’t pretend to be an idiot. 
Gussy! You know very well that 
even with ultra-sub-micro nothing 
quite this small can possibly have 
enough elements to do any think- 
ing.” 

Gusterson shrugged. “I don’t 
know about that. I think bugs 
think.” 

I^AY groaned faintly. “Bugs op- 
erate by instinct, Gussy,” he 
said. “A patterned routine. They 
do not scan situations and con- 
sequences and then make deci- 
sions.” 

“I don’t expect bugs to make 
decisions,” Gusterson said. “For 
that matter I don’t like people 



16 



GALAXY 



who go around alia time making 
decisions.” 

“Well, you can take it from me, 
Gussy, that this tickler is just a 
miniaturized wire recorder and 
clock . , . and a tickler. It doesn’t 
do anything else.” 

“Not yet, maybe,” Gusterson 
said darkly. “Not this model. Fay, 
I’m serious about bugs thinking. 
Or if they don’t exactly think, 
they feel. They’ve got an interior 
drama. An inner glow. They’re 
conscious. For that matter. Fay, 
I think all your really complex 
electronic computers are con- 
scious too.” 

“Quit kidding. Gussy.” 

“Who’s kidding?” 

“You are. Computers simply 
aren’t alive.” 

“What’s alive? A word. I think 
computers are conscious, at least 
while they’re operating. They’ve 
got that inner glow of awareness. 
They sort of . well . medi- 
tate.” 

“Gussy, computers haven’t got 
any circuits for meditating. 
They’re not programmed for 
mystical lucubrations. They’ve 
just got circuits for solving the 
problems they’re on.” 

“Okay, you admit they’ve got 
problem-solving circuits — like 
a man has. I say if they’ve got the 
equipment for being conscious, 
they’re conscious. What has 
wings, flies.” 

“Including stuffed owls and 



gilt eagles and dodoes — and 
wood-burning airplanes?” 

“Maybe, under some circum- 
stances. There was a wood-burn- 
ing airplane. Fay,” Gusterson 
continued, wagging his wrists for 
emphasis, “I really think compu- 
ters are conscious. They just don’t 
have any way of telling us that 
they are. Or maybe they don’t 
have any reason to tell us, like 
the little Scotch boy who didn’t 
say a word until he was fifteen 
and was supposed to be deaf and 
dumb.” 

“Why didn’t he say a word?” 
“Because he’d never had any- 
thing to say. Or take those Hindu 
fakirs, Fay, who sit still and don’t 
say a word for thirty years or 
until their fingernails grow to the 
next village. If Hindu fakirs- can 
do that, computers can!” 

Looking as if he were masticat- 
ing a lemon, Fay asked quietly, 
“Gussy, did you say you’re work- 
ing on an insanity novel?” 

USTERSON frowned fiercely. 

“Now you’re kidding,” he ac- 
cused Fay. “The dirty kind of 
kidding, too.” 

“I’m sorry,” Fay said with light 
contrition. “Well, now you’ve 
sniffed at it, how about trying on 
Tickler?” He picked up the 
gleaming blunted crescent and 
jogged it temptingly under Gus- 
terson’s chin. 

“Why should I?” Gusterson 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS

asked, stepping back. “Fay, I’m 
up to my ears writing a book. The 
last thing I want is something in- 
terrupting me to make me listen 
to a lot of junk and do a lot of 
useless things.” 

“But, dammit, Gussy! It was 
all your idea in the first place!” 
Fay blatted. Then, catching him- 
self, he added, “I mean, you were 
one of the first people to think of 
this particular sort of instrument” 

“Maybe so, but I’ve done some 
more thinking since then.” Gus- 
terson’s voice grew a trifle solemn. 
“Inner-directed worthwhile think- 
in’. Fay, when a man forgets to 
do something, it’s because he 
really doesn’t want to do it or 
because he’s all roiled up down 
in his unconscious. He ought to 
take it as a danger signal and 
investigate the roiling, not hire 
himself a human or mech remin- 
der.” 

“Bushwa,” Fay retorted. “In 
that case you shouldn’t write 
memorandums or even take 
notes.” 

“Maybe I shouldn’t,” Guster- 
son agreed lamely. “I’d have to 
think that over too.” 

“Ha!” Fay jeered. “No, I’ll tell 
you what your trouble is, Gussy. 
You’re simply scared of this con- 
traption. You’ve loaded your 
skull with horror-story nonsense 
about machines sprouting minds 
and taking over the world — un- 
til you’re even scared of a simple 



miniaturized and clocked re- 
corder.” He thrust it out. 

“Maybe I am,” Gusterson ad- 
mitted, controlling a flinch. “Hon- 
estly, Fay, that thing’s got a 
gleam in its eye as if it had ideas 
of its own. Nasty ideas.” 

“Gussy, you nut, it hasn’t ^ot 
an eye.” 

“Not now, no, but it’s got the 
gleam — the eye may come. It’s 
the Chesire cat in reverse. If 
you’d step over here and look at 
yourself holding it, you could see 
what I mean. But I don’t think 
computers sprout minds. Fay. I 
just think they’ve ^ot minds, be- 
cause they’ve got the mind ele- 
ments.” 

“Ho, ho!” Fay mocked. “Every- 
thing that has a material side has 
a mental side,” he chanted. 
“Everything that’s a body is also 
a spirit. Gussy, that dubious old 
metaphysical dualism went out 
centuries ago.” 

“Maybe so,” Gusterson said, 
“but we still haven’t anything but 
that dubious dualism to explain 
the human mind, have we? It’s a 
jelly of nerve cells and it’s a 
vision of the cosmos. If that isn’t 
dualism, what is?” 

“I give up. Gussy, are you go- 
ing to try out this tickler?” 

“No!” 

“But dammit. Gussy, we made 
it just for you! — practically.” 

“Sorry, but I’m not coming 
near the thing.”

“ ’Zen come near me,” a husky 
voice intoned behind them. “To- 
night I vant a man.” 

standing in the door was 
^ something slim in a short 
silver sheath. It had golden bangs 
and the haughtiest snub-nosed 
face in the world. It slunk toward 
them. 

“My God, Vina Vidarsson!” 
Gusterson yelled. 

“Daisy, that’s terrific,” Fay ap- 
plauded, going up to her. 

She bumped him aside with a 
swing of her hips, continuing to 
advance. “Not you. Ratty,” she 
said throatily. “I vant a real 
man.” 

“Fay, I suggested Vina Vidars- 
son’s face for the beauty mask,” 
Gusterson said, walking around 
his wife and shaking a finger. 
“Don’t tell me Trix just happened 
to think of that too.” 

“What else could they think 
of?” Fay laughed. “This season 
sex means VV and nobody else.” 
An odd little grin flicked his lips, 
a tic traveled up his face and his 
body twitched slightly. “Say, folks, 
I’m going to have to be leaving. 
It’s exactly fifteen minutes to 
Second Curfew. Last time I had 
to run and I got heartburn. When 
are you people going to move 
downstairs? I’ll leave Tickler, 
Gussy. Play around with it and 
get used to it. ’By now.” 

“Hey, Fay,” Gusterson called 



curiously, “have you developed 
absolute time sense?” 

Fay grinned a big grin from 
the doorway — almost too big a 
grin for so small a man. “I didn’t 
need to,” he said softly, patting 
his right shoulder. “My tickler 
told me.” 

He closed the door behind him. 
As side-by-side they watched 
him strut sedately across the 
murky chilly-looking park, Gus- 
terson mused, “So the little devil 
had one of those nonsense-gadgets 
on all the time and I never no- 
ticed. Can you beat that?” Some- 
thing drew across the violet-tinged 
stars a short bright line that 
quickly faded. “What’s that?” 
Gusterson asked gloomily. “Next 
to last stage of missile-here?” 
“Won’t you settle for an old- 
fashioned shooting star?” Daisy 
asked softly. The (wettable) vel- 
vet lips of the mask made even 
her natural voice sound different. 
She reached a hand back of her 
neck to pull the thing off. 

“Hey, don’t do that,” Guster- 
son protested in a hurt voice. 
“Not for a while anyway.” 

“Hokay!” she said harshly, 
turning on him. “Zen down on 
your knees, dog!” 

Ill 

TT WAS a fortnight and Guster- 
son was loping down the home 
stretch on his 40,000-word in- 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS

sanity novel before Fay dropped 
in again, this time promptly at 
high noon. 

Normally Fay cringed his 
shoulders a trifle and was in- 
clined to slither, but now he 
strode aggressively, his legs scis- 
soring in a fast, low goosestep. He 
whipped off the sunglasses that 
all moles wore topside by day 
and began to pound Gusterson on 
the back while calling boister- 
ously, “How are you, Gussy Old 
Boy, Old Boy?” 

Daisy came in from the kitch- 
en to see why Gusterson was 
choking. She was instantly grab- 
bed and violently bussed to the 
accompaniment of, “Hiya, Gor- 
geous! Yum-yum! How about ad- 
libbing that some weekend?” 

She stared at Fay dazedly, 
rasping the back of her hand 
across her mouth, while Guster- 
son yelled, “Quit that! What’s got 
into you, Fay? Have they trans- 
ferred you out of R & D to Com- 
pany Morale? Do they line up 
all the secretaries at roll call and 
make you give them an eight- 
hour energizing kiss?” 

“Ha, wouldn’t you like to 
know? Fay retorted. He grinned, 
twitched jumpingly, held still a 
moment, then hustled over to the 
far wall. “Look out there,” he 
rapped, pointing through the vio- 
let glass at a gap between the two 
nearest old skyscraper apart- 
ments. “In thirty seconds you’ll 



see them test the new needle 
bomb at the other end of Lake 
Erie. It’s educational.” He began 
to count off seconds, vigorously 
semaphoring his arm. “. Two 
. three . Gussy, I’ve put 
through a voucher for two yards 
for you. Budgeting squawked, but 
I pressured ’em.” 

Daisy squealed, “Yards! — are 
those dollar thousands?” while 
Gusterson was asking, “Then 
you’re marketing the tickler?” 
“Yes. Yes,” Fay* replied to 
them in turn. “. Nine . 
ten . .” Again he grinned and 
twitched. “Time for noon Corn- 
staff,” he announced staccato. 
“Pardon the hush box.” He 
whipped a pancake phone from 
under his coat, clapped it over his 
face and spoke fiercely but in- 
audibly into it, continuing to sem- 
aphore. Suddenly he thrust the 
phone away. “Twenty-nine . 
thirty . Thar she blows!” 

An incandescent streak shot up 
the sky from a little above the 
far horizon and a doubly dazzling 
point of light appeared just above 
the top of it, with the effect of 
God dotting an “i”. 

“Ha, that’ll skewer espionage 
satellites like swatting flies!” Fay 
proclaimed as the portent faded. 
“Bracing! Gussy, where’s your 
tickler? I’ve got a new spool for 
it that’ll razzle-dazzle you.” 

“I’ll bet,” Gusterson said drily. 
“Daisy?” '

“You gave it to the kids and 
they got to fooling with it and 
broke it.” 

“No matter,” Fay told them 
with a large sidewise sweep of 
his hand. “Better you wait for the 
new model. It’s a six-way im- 
provement.” 

“So I gather,” Gusterson said, 
eyeing him speculatively. “Does 
it automatically inject you with 
cocaine? A fix every hour on the 
second?” 

“Ha-ha, joke. Gussy, it achieves 
the same effect without using any 
dope at all. Listen: a tickler re- 
minds you of your duties and op- 
portunities — your chances for 
happiness and success! What’s 
the obvious next step?” 

4i^^HROW it out the window. 

By the way, how do you do 
that when you’re underground?” 

“We have hi-speed garbage 
boosts. The obvious next step is 
you give the tickler a heart It 
not only tells you, it warmly per- 
suades you. It doesn’t just say, 
“Tum on the TV Channel Two, 
Joyce program,’ it brills at you, 
‘Kid, Old Kid, race for the TV 
and flip that Two Switch! There’s 
a great show coming through the 
pipes this second plus ten — 
you’ll enjoy the hell out of your- 
self! Grab a ticket to ecstacyl’ ” 

“My God,” Gusterson gasped, 
“are those the kind of jolts it’s 
giving you now?” 



“Don’t you get it. Gussy? You 
never load your tickler except 
when you’re feeling buoyantly 
enthusiastic. You don’t just tell 
yourself what to do hour by hour 
next week, you sell yourself on 
it. That way you not only make 
doubly sure you’ll obey instruc- 
tions but you constantly reinocu- 
late yourself with your own en- 
thusiasm.” 

“I can’t stand myself when I’m 
that enthusiastic,” Gusterson said. 
“I feel ashamed for hours after- 
wards.” 

“You’re warped — all this 
lonely sky-life. What’s more, 
Gussy, think how still more per- 
suasive some of those instructions 
would be if they came to a man 
in his best girl’s most bedroomy 
voice, or his doctor’s or psycher’s 
if it’s that sort of thing — or 
Vina Vidarsson’s! By the way. 
Daze, don’t wear that beauty 
mask outside. It’s a grand mis- 
demeanor ever since ten thous- 
and teen-agers rioted through 
Tunnel-Mart wearing them. And 
VV’s sueing Trix.” 

“No chance of that,” Daisy said. 
“Gusterson got excited and bit 
off the nose.” She pinched her 
own delicately. 

“I’d no more obey my enthu- 
siastic self,” Gusterson was brood- 
ing, “than I’d obey a Napoleon 
drunk on his own brandy or a 
hopped-up SL Francis. Reinocu- 
lated with my own enthusiasm? 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



21 



I’d die just like from snake-bite!” 
“Warped, I said,” Fay dogma- 
tized, stamping around. “Gussy, 
having the instructions persua- 
sive instead of neutral turned out 
to be only the opening wedge. 
The next step wasn’t so obvious, 
but I saw it. Using subliminal 
verbal stimuli in his tickler, a 
man can be given constant sup- 
portive euphoric therapy 24 
hours a day! And it makes use 
of all that empty wire. We’ve re- 
vived the ideas of a pioneer dy- 
namic psycher named Dr. Coue. 
For instance, right now my tick- 
ler is saying to me — in tones too 
soft to reach my conscious mind, 
but do they stab into the uncon- 
scious! — ‘Day by day in every 
way I’m getting sharper and 
sharper.’ It alternates that with 
‘gutsier and gutsier’ and . well, 
forget that. Coue mostly used 
‘better and better’ but that seems 
too general. And every hun- 
dredth time it says them out loud 
and the tickler give me a brush 
— just a faint cootch — to make 
sure I’m keeping in touch.” 
“That third word-pair,” Daisy 
wondered, feeling her mouth 
reminiscently. “Could I guess?” 

^USTERSON’S eyes had been 
growing wider and wider. 
“Fay,” he said, “I could no more 
use my mind for anything if I 
knew all that was going on in my 
inner ear than if I were being 



brushed down with brooms by 
three witches. Look here,” he said 
with loud authority, “you got to 
stop all this — it’s crazy. Fay, if 
Micro’ll junk the tickler. I’ll 
think you up something else to 
invent — something real good.” 

“Your inventing days are 
over,” Fay brilled gleefully. “I 
mean, you’ll never equal your 
masterpiece.” 

“How about,” Gusterson bel- 
lowed, “an anti-individual guided 
missile? The physicists have got 
small-scale antigravity good 
enough to float and fly some- 
thing the size of a hand grenade. 
I can smell that even though it’s 
a back-of-the-safe military secret. 
Well, how about keying such a 
missile to a man’s finger-prints — 
or brainwaves, maybe, or his 
unique smell! — so it can spot 
and follow him around the target 
in on him, without harming any- 
one else? Long-distance assassi- 
nation — and the stinkingest gets 
it! Or you could simply load it 
with some disgusting goo and key 
it to teen-agers as a group — 
that’d take care of them. Fay, 
doesn’t it give you a rich, warm 
kick to think of my midget mis- 
siles buzzing around in your tun- 
nels, seeking out evil-doers, like 
a swarm of angry wasps or an- 
gelic bumblebees?” 

“You’re not luring me down 
any side trails,” Fay said laugh- 
ingly. He grinned and twitched. 



22

then hurried toward the opposite 
wall, motioning them to follow. 
Outside, about a hundred yards 
beyond the purple glass, rose an- 
other ancient glass-walled apart- 
ment skyscraper. Beyond, Lake 
Erie rippled glintingly. 

“Another bomb-test?” Guster- 
son asked. 

Fay pointed at the building. 
“Tomorrow,” he announced, “a 
modern factory, devoted solely to 
the manufacture of ticklers, will 
be erected on that site.” 

“You mean one of those win- 
dowless phallic eyesores?” Gus- 
terson demanded. “Fay, you peo- 
ple aren’t even consistent. You’ve 
got all your homes underground. 
Why not your factories?” 

“Sh! Not enough room. And 
night missiles are scarier.” 

“I know that building’s been 
empty for a year,” Daisy said un- 
easily, “but how — ?” 

“Sh! Watch! Now!" 

The looming building seemed 
to blur or fuzz for a moment. 
Then it was as if the lake’s bright 
ripples had invaded the old glass 
a hundred yards away. Wavelets 
chased themselves up and down 
the gleaming walls, became high- 
er, higher . and then suddenly 
the glass cracked all over to tiny 
fragments and fell away, to be 
followed quickly by fragmented 
concrete and plastic and plastic 
piping, until all that was left was 
the nude steel framework, vibrat- 



ing so rapidly as to be almost in- 
visible against the gleaming lake. 

rjAISY COVERED her ears, 
but there was no explosion, 
only a long-drawn-out low crash 
as the fragments hit twenty floors 
below and dust whooshed out 
sideways. 

“Spectacular!” Fay summed 
up. “Knew you’d enjoy it. That 
little trick was first conceived by 
the great Tesla during his last 
fruity years. Research discovered 
it in his biog — we just made the 
dream come true. A tiny reso- 
nance device you could carry in 
your belt-bag attunes itself to the 
natural harmonic of a structure 
and then increases amplitude by 
tiny pushes exactly in time. Just 
like soldiers marching in step can 
break down a bridge, only this is 
as if it were being done by one 
marching ant.” He pointed at the 
naked framework appearing out 
of its own blur and said, “We’ll 
be able to hang the factory on 
that. If not, we’ll whip a mega- 
current through it and vaporize 
it. No question the micro-resona- 
tor is the neatest sweetest wreck- 
ing device going. You can expect 
a lot more of this sort of effi- 
ciency now that mankind has the 
tickler to enable him to use his 
full potential. What’s the matter, 
folks?” 

Daisy was staring around the 
violet-walled room with dumb 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS

mistrust. Her hands were trem- 
bling. 

“You don’t have to worry,” 
Fay assured her with an under- 
standing laugh. “This building’s 
safe for a month more at least.” 
Suddenly he grimaced and 
leaped a foot in the air. He raised 
a clawed hand to scratch his 
shoulder but managed to check 
the movement. “Got to beat it, 
folks,” he announced tersely. “My 
tickler gave me the grand 
cootch.” 

“Don’t go yet,” Gusterson 
called, rousing himself with a 
shudder which he immediately 
explained: “I just had the illu- 
sion that if I shook myself all my 
flesh and guts would fall off my 
shimmying skeleton. Brr! Fay, 
before you and Micro go off half 
cocked, I want you to know 
there’s one insuperable objection 
to the tickler as a mass-market 
item. The average man or woman 
won’t go to the considerable time 
and trouble it must take to load 
a tickler. He simply hasn’t got 
the compulsive orderliness and 
willingness to plan that it re- 
quires.” 

“We thought of that weeks 
ago,” Fay rapped, his hand on the 
door. “Every tickler spool that 
goes to market is patterned like 
wallpaper with one of five de- 
signs of suitable subliminal sup- 
portive euphoric material. ‘Ittier 
and ittier,’ ‘viriler and viriler’ — 



you know. The buyer is robot- 
interviewed for an hour, his per- 
sonalized daily routine laid out 
and thereafter templated on his 
weekly spool. He’s strongly urged 
next to take his tickler to his doc- 
tor and psycher for further in- 
struction-imposition. We’ve been 
working with the medical profes- 
sion from the start. They love 
the tickler because it’ll remind 
people to take their medicine on 
the dot . and rest and eat and 
go to sleep just when and how 
doc says. This is a big operation. 
Gussy — a biiiiiiig operation! ’By!” 

Daisy hurried to the wall to 
watch him cross the park. Deep 
down she was a wee bit worried 
that he might linger to attach a 
micro-resonator to this building 
and she wanted to time him. But 
Gusterson settled down to his 
typewriter and began to bat 
away, 

“I want to have another novel 
started,” he explained to her, “be- 
fore the ant marches across this 
building in about four and a half 
weeks ... or a million sharp lit- 
tle gutsy guys come swarming 
out of the ground and heave it 
into Lake Erie.”

'P'ARLY NEXT morning win- 
dowless walls began to crawl 
up the stripped skyscraper be- 
tween them and the lake. Daisy

pulled the black-out curtains on 
that side. For a day or two longer 
their thoughts and conversations 
were haunted by Gusterson’s 
vague sardonic visions of a horde 
of tickler-energized moles pour- 
ing up out of the tunnels to tear 
down the remaining trees, tank 
the atmosphere and perhaps 
somehow dismantle the stars — 
at least on this side of the world 
— but then they both settled 
back into their customary easy- 
going routines. Gusterson typed. 
Daisy made her daily shopping 
trip to a little topside daytime 
store and started painting a mu- 
ral on the floor of the empty 
apartment next theirs but one. 

“We ought to lasso some neigh- 
bors,” she suggested once. “I need 
somebody to hold my brushes 
and admire. How about you mak- 
ing a trip below at the cocktail 
hours, Gusterson, and picking up 
a couple of girls for a starter? 
Flash the old viriler charm, 
cootch them up a bit, emphasize 
the delights of high living, but 
make sure they’re compatible 
roommates. You could pick up 
that two-yard check from Micro 
at the same time.” 

“You’re an immoral money- 
ravenous wench,” Gusterson said 
absently, trying to dream of an 
insanity beyond insanity that 
would make his next novel a real 
id-rousing best-vender. 

“If that's your vision of me, 



you shouldn’t have chewed up 
the VV mask.” 

“I’d really prefer you with 
green stripes,” he told her. “But 
stripes, spots, or sun-bathing, 
you’re better than those cocktail 
moles.” 

Actually both of them acutely 
disliked going below. They much 
preferred to perch in their eyrie 
and watch the people of Cleve- 
land Depths, as they privately 
called the local sub-suburb, rush 
up out of the shelters at dawn to 
work in the concrete fields and 
windowless factories, make their 
daytime jet trips and freeway 
jaunts, do their noon-hour and 
coffee-break guerrilla practice, 
and then go scurrying back at 
twilight to the atomic-proof, 
brightly lit, vastly exciting, claus- 
trophobic caves. 

Fay and his projects began 
once more to seem dreamlike, 
though Gusterson did run across 
a cryptic advertisement for tick- 
lers in The Manchester Guard- 
ian, which he got daily by fac- 
simile. Their three children re- 
ported similar ads, of no interest 
to young fry, on the TV and one 
afternoon they came home with 
the startling news that the moni- 
tors at their subsurface school 
had been issued ticklers. On 
sharp interrogation by Guster- 
son, however, it app>eared that 
these last were not ticklers but 
merely two-way radios linked to 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



25 




the school police station trans- 
mitter. 

“Which is bad enough,” Gus- 
terson commented later to Daisy. 
“But it’d be even dirtier to think 
of those clock-watching super- 
egos being strapped to kids’ 
shoulders. Can you imagine Huck 
Finn with a tickler, tellin’ him 
when to tie up the raft to a tow- 
head and when to take a swim?” 

“I bet Fay could,” Daisy 
countered. “When’s he going to 
bring you that check, anyhow? 
lago wants a jetcycle and I 
promised Imogene a Vina Kit 
and then Claudius’ll have to have 
something.” 

Gusterson scowled thought- 
fully. “You know, Daze,” he said, 



“I got a feeling Fay’s in the hos- 
pital, all narcotized up and being 
fed intravenously. The way he 
was jumping around last time, 
that tickler was going to cootch 
him to pieces in a week.” 

A S IF TO refute this intuition, 
Fay turned up that very 
evening. The lights were dim. 
Something had gone wrong with 
the building’s old transformer 
and, pending repairs, the two re- 
maining occupied apartments 
were making do with batteries, 
which turned bright globes to 
mysterious amber candles and 
made Gusterson's ancient type- 
writer operate sluggishly. 

Fay’s manner was subdued or 



26 



GALAXY 




at least closely controlled and 
for a moment Gusterson thought 
he’d shed his tickler. Then the 
little man came out of the shad- 
ows and Gusterson saw the large 
bulge on his right shoulder. 

“Yes, we had to up it a bit 
sizewise,” Fay explained in 
clipped tones. “Additional super- 
features. While brilliantly suc- 
cessful on the whole, the sub- 
liminal euphorics were a shade 
too effective. Several hundred 
users went hoppity manic. We 
gentled the cootch and qualified 
the subliminals — you know, 
‘Day by day in every way I’m 
getting sharper and more serene’ 
— but a stabilizing influence was 
still needed, so after a top-level 



conference we decided to com- 
bine Tickler with Moodmaster.” 
“My God,” Gusterson inter- 
jected, “do they have a machine 
now that does that?” 

“Of course. They’ve been using 
them on ex-mental patients for 
years.” 

“I just don’t keep up with 
progress,” Gusterson said, shak- 
ing his head bleakly. “I’m falling 
behind on all fronts.” 

“You ought to have your tick- 
ler remind you to read Science 
Service releases,” Fay told him. 
“Or simply instruct it to scan the 
releases and — no, that’s still in 
research.” He looked at Guster- 
son’s shoulder and his eyes wi- 
dened. “You’re not wearing the 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



27 




new-model tickler I sent you,” 
he said accusingly. 

“I never got it,” Gusterson as- 
sured him. “Postmen deliver 
top-side mail and parcels by 
throwing them on the high-speed 
garbage boosts and hoping a tor- 
nado will blow them to the right 
addresses.” Then he added help- 
fully, “Maybe the Russians stole 
it while it was riding the whirl- 
winds.” 

“That’s not a suitable topic for 
jesting,” Fay frowned. “We’re 
hoping that Tickler will mobilize 
the full potential of the Free 
World for the first time in his- 
tory. Gusterson, you are going to 
have to wear a ticky-tick. It’s be- 
coming impossible for a man to 
get through modern life without 
one.” 

“Maybe I will,” Gusterson said 
appeasingly, “but right now tell 
me about Moodmaster. I want to 
put it in my new insanity novel.” 

Fay shook his head. “Your 
readers will just think you’re be- 
hind the times. If you use it, 
underplay it. But anyhow, Mood- 
master is a simple physiotherapy 
engine that monitors bloodstream 
chemicals and body electricity. It 
ties directly into the blood- 
stream, keeping blood, sugar, et 
cetera, at optimum levels and in- 
jecting euphrin or depressin as 
necessary — and occasionally a 
touch of extra adrenaline, as dur- 
ing work emergencies.” 



“Is it painful?” Daisy called 
from the bedroom. 

“Excruciating,” Gusterson called 
back. “Excuse it, please,” he 
grinned at Fay. “Hey, didn’t I 
suggest cocaine injections last 
time I saw you?” 

“So you did,” Fay agreed flat- 
ly. “Oh by the way. Gussy, here’s 
that check for a yard I promised 
you. Micro doesn’t muzzle the 
ox.” 

“Hooray!” Daisy cheered faint- 
ly- 

THOUGHT you said it was 
going to be for two.” Gus- 
terson complained. 

“Budgeting always forces a 
last-minute compromise,” Fay 
shrugged. “You have to learn to 
accept those things.” 

“I love accepting money and 
I’m glad any time for three feet,” 
Daisy called agreeably. “Six feet 
might make me wonder if I 
weren’t an insect, but getting a 
yard just makes me feel like a 
gangster’s moll.” 

“Want to come out and gloat 
over the yard paper. Toots, and 
stuff it in your diamond-embroid- 
ered net stocking top?” Guster- 
son called back. 

“No, I’m doing something to 
that portion of me just now. But 
hang onto the yard, Gusterson.” 
“Aye-aye, Cap'n,” he assured 
her. Then, turning back to Fay, 
“So you’ve taken the Dr. Coue

repeating out of the tickler?” 

“Oh, no. Just balanced it off 
with depressin. The subliminals 
are still a prime sales-point. All 
the tickler features are cumula- 
tive, Gussy. You’re still under- 
estimating the scope of the de- 
vice.” 

“I guess I am. What’s this 
‘work-emergencies’ business? If 
you’re using the tickler to inject 
drugs into workers to keep them 
going, that’s really just my co- 
caine suggestion modernized and 
I’m putting in for another thou. 
Hundreds of years ago the South 
American Indians chewed coca 
leaves to kill fatigue sensations.” 

“That so? Interesting — and 
it proves priority for the Indians, 
doesn’t it? I’ll make a try for you, 
Gussy, but don’t expect any- 
thing.” He cleared his throat, his 
eyes grew distant and, turning 
his head a little to the right, he 
enunciated sharply, “Pooh-Bah. 
Time: Inst oh five. One oh five 
seven. Oh oh. Record: Gussy 
coca thou budget. Cut.” He ex- 
plained, “We got a voice-cued 
setter now on the deluxe models. 
You can record a memo to your- 
self without taking off your shirt. 
Incidentally, I use the ends of the 
hours for trifle-memos. I’ve al- 
ready used up the fifty-nines and 
eights for tomorrow and started 
on the fifty-sevens.” 

“I understood most of your 
memo,” Gusterson told him gruff- 



ly. “The last ‘Oh oh’ was for sec- 
onds, wasn’t it? Now I call that 
crude — why not microseconds 
too? But how do you remember 
where you’ve made a memo so 
you don’t rerecord over it? After 
all, you’re rerecording over the 
wallpaper all the time.” 

“Tickler beeps and then hunts 
for the nearest information-free 
space.” 

“I see. And what’s the Pooh- 
Bah for?” 

Fay smiled. “Cut. My pass- 
word for activating the setter, so 
it won’t respond to chance nu- 
merals it overhears.” 

“But why Pooh-Bah?” 

Fay grinned. “Cut. And you a 
writer. It’s a literary reference, 
Gussy. Pooh-Bah (cut!) was 
Lord High Everything Else in 
The Mikado. He had a little list 
and nothing on it would ever be 
missed.” 

YEAH,” Gusterson re- 
membered, glowering. “As 
I recall it, all that went on that 
list was the names of people who 
were slated to have their heads 
chopped off by Ko-Ko. Better 
watch your step, Shorty. It may 
be a back-handed omen. Maybe 
all those workers you’re puttin’ 
ticklers on to pump them full of 
adrenaline so they’ll overwork 
without noticin’ it will revolt and 
come out some day choppin’ for 
your head.” 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



29 



“Spare me the Marxist mythol- 
ogy,” Fay protested. “Gussy, 
you’ve got a completely wrong 
slant on Tickler. It’s true that 
most of our mass sales so far, bar 
government and army, have been 
to large companies purchasing 
for their employees — ” 

“Ah-ha!” 

“ — but that’s because there’s 
nothing like a tickler for teach- 
ing a new man his job. It tells 
him from instant to instant what 
he must do — while he’s already 
on the job and without disturb- 
ing other workers. Magnetizing a 
wire with a job pattern is the 
easiest thing going. And you’d be 
astonished what the subliminals 
do for employee morale. It’s this 
way, Gussy: most people are too 
improvident and unimaginative 
to see in advance the advantages 
of ticklers. They buy one because 
the company strongly suggests it 
and payment is on easy install- 
ments withheld from salary. 
They find a tickler makes the 
work day go easier. The little fel- 
low perched on your shoulder is 
a friend exuding comfort and 
good advice. The first thing he’s 
set to say is ‘Take it easy, pal.’ 

“Within a week they’re wear- 
ing their tickler 24 hours a day 
— and buying a tickler for the 
wife, so she’ll remember to comb 
her hair and smile real pretty 
and cook favorite dishes.” 

“I get it, Fay,” Gusterson cut 



in. “The tickler is the newest fad 
for increasing worker efficiency. 
Once, I read somewheres, it was 
salt tablets. They had salt-tablet 
dispensers everywhere, even in 
air-conditioned offices where 
there wasn’t a moist armpit twice 
a year and the gals sweat only 
champagne. A decade later peo- 
ple wondered what all those 
dusty white pills were for. Some- 
times they were mistook for tran- 
quilizers. It’ll be the same way 
with ticklers. Somebody’ll open 
a musty closet and see jumbled 
heaps of these gripping-hand sil- 
very gadgets gathering dust curls 
and — ” 

“They will not!” Fay protested 
vehemently. “Ticklers are not a 
fad — they’re history-changers, 
they’re Free-World revolution- 
ary! Why, before Micro Systems 
put a single one on the market, 
we’d made it a rule that every 
Micro employee had to wear one! 
If that’s not having supreme con- 
fidence in a product — ” 

“Every employee except the 
top executives, of course,” Gus- 
terson interrupted jeeringly. “And 
that’s not demoting you. Fay. 
As the R & D chief most closely 
involved, you’d naturally have to 
show special enthusiasm.” 

“But you’re wrong there, Gus- 
sy,” Fay crowed. “Man for man, 
our top executives have been 
more enthusiastic about their 
personal ticklers than any other 



30 



GALAXY 



class of worker in the whole out- 
fit.” 

Gusterson slumped and shook 
his head. “If that’s the case,” he 
said darkly, “maybe mankind de- 
serves the tickler.” 

64T’LL SAY IT does!” Fay 
agreed loudly without 
thinking. Then, “Oh, can the 
carping, Gussy. Tickler’s a great 
invention. Don’t deprecate it just 
because you had something to do 
with its genesis. You’re going to 
have to get in the swim and wear 
one.” 

“Maybe I’d rather drown hor- 
ribly.” 

“Can the gloom-talk too! Gus- 
sy, I said it before and I say it 
again, you’re just scared of this 
new thing. Why, you’ve even got 
the drapes pulled so you won’t 
have to look at the tickler fac- 
tory.” 

“Yes, I am scared,” Gusterson 
said. “Really sea . AWP!” 

Fay whirled around. Daisy was 
standing in the bedroom door- 
way, wearing the short silver 
sheath. This time there was no 
mask, but her bobbed hair was 
glitteringly silvered, while her 
legs, arms, hands, neck, face — 
every bit of her exposed skin — 
was painted with beautifully 
even vertical green stripes. 

“I did it as a surprise for Gus- 
terson,” she explained to Fay. 
“He says he likes me this way. 



The green glop’s supposed to be 
smudgeproof.” 

Gusterson did not comment. 
His face had a rapt expression. 
“I’ll tell you why your tickler’s 
so popular. Fay,” he said softly. 
“It’s not because it backstops the 
memory or because it boosts the 
ego with subliminals. It’s because 
it takes the hook out of a guy, it 
takes over the job of withstand- 
ing the pressure of living. See, 
Fay, here are all these little guys 
in this subterranean rat race with 
atomic-death squares and chro- 
mium-plated reward squares and 
enough money if you pass Go 
almost to get to Go again — and 
a million million rules of the 
game to keep in mind. Well, 
here’s this one little guy and 
every morning he wakes up 
there’s all these things he’s got 
to keep in mind to do or he’ll 
lose his turn three times in a row 
and maybe a terrible black rook 
in iron armor’ll loom up and bang 
him off the chessboard. But now, 
look, now he’s got his tickler and 
he tells his sweet silver tickler 
all these things and the tickler’s 
got to remember them. Of course 
he’ll have to do them eventually 
but meanwhile the pressure’s off 
him, the hook’s out of his short 
hairs. He’s shifted the responsi- 
bility . .” 

“Well, what’s so bad about 
that?” Fay broke in loudly. 
“What’s wrong with taking the 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



31 



pressure off little guys? Why 
shouldn’t Tickler be a super-ego 
surrogate? Micro’s Motivations 
chief noticed that positive fea- 
ture straight off and scored it 
three pluses. Besides, it’s nothing 
but a gaudy way of saying that 
Tickler backstops the memory. 
Seriously, Gussy, what’s so bad 
about it?” 

“I don’t know,” Gusterson said 
slowly, his eyes still far away. “I 
just know it feels bad to me.” He 
crinkled his big forehead. “Well 
for one thing,” he said, “it means 
that a man’s taking orders from 
something else. He’s got a kind 
of master. He’s sinking back into 
a slave psychology.” 

“He’s only taking orders from 
himself,” Fay countered dis- 
gustedly. “Tickler’s just a mech 
reminder, a notebook, in essence 
no more than the back of an old 
envelope. It’s no master.” 

“Are you absolutely sure of 
that?” Gusterson asked quietly. 

“Why, Gussy, you big oaf — ” 
Fay began heatedly. Suddenly 
his features quirked and he 
twitched. “ ’Scuse me, folks,” he 
said rapidly, heading for the 
door, “but my tickler told me I 
gotta go.” 

“Hey Fay, don’t you mean you 
told your tickler to tell you when 
it was time to go?” Gusterson 
called after him. 

Fay looked back in the door- 
way. He wet his lips, his eyes 



moved from side to side. “I’m not 
quite sure,” he said in an odd 
strained voice and darted out. 

^ USTERSON stared for some 
seconds at the pattern of 
emptiness Fay had left. Then he 
shivered. Then he shrugged. “I 
must be slipping,” he muttered. 
“I never even suggested some- 
thing for him to invent.” Then he 
looked around at Daisy, who was 
still standing poker-faced in her 
doorway. 

“Hey, you look like something 
out of the Arabian Nights,” he 
told her. “Are you supposed to 
be anything special? How far do 
those stripes go, anyway?” 

“You could probably find out,” 
she told him coolly. “All you have 
to do is kill me a dragon or two 
first.” 

He studied her. “My God,” he 
said reverently, “I really have all 
the fun in life. What do I do to 
deserve this?” 

“You’ve got a big gun,” she 
told him, “and you go out in the 
world with it and hold up big 
companies and take yards and 
yards of money away from them 
in rolls like ribbon and bring it 
all home to me.” 

“Don’t say that about the gun 
again,” he said. “Don’t whisper it, 
don’t even think it. I’ve got one, 
dammit — thirty-eight caliber, 
yet — and I don’t want some 
psionic monitor with two-way 



32 



GALAXY 



clairaudience they haven’t told 
me about catching the whisper 
and coming to take the gun away 
from us. It’s one of the few indi- 
viduality symbols we’ve got left.” 

Suddenly Daisy whirled away 
from the door, spun three times 
so that her silvered hair stood 
out like a metal coolie hat, and 
sank to a curtsey in the middle 
of the room. 

“I’ve just thought of what I 
am,” she announced, fluttering 
her eyelashes at him. “I’m a sweet 
silver tickler with green stripes.” 

V 

I^EXT day Daisy cashed the 

’ Micro check for ten hun- 
dred silver smackers, which she 
hid in a broken radionic coffee 
urn. Gusterson sold his insanity 
novel and started a new one 
about a mad medic with a hic- 
cupy hysterical chuckle, who gim- 
micked Moodmasters to turn 
mental patients into nympho- 
maniacs, mass murderers and 
compulsive saints. But this time 
he couldn’t get Fay out of his 
mind, or the last chilling words 
the nervous little man had spo- 
ken. 

For that matter, he couldn’t 
blank the underground out of his 
mind as effectively as usually. 
He had the feeling that a new 
kind of mole was loose in the 
burrows and that the ground at 



the foot of their skyscraper might 
start humping up any minute. 

Toward the end of one after- 
noon he tucked a half dozen new- 
ly typed sheets in his pocket, 
shrouded his typer, went to the 
hatrack and took down his prize: 
a miner’s hard-top cap with elec- 
tric headlamp. 

“Coin* below, Cap’n,” he shout- 
ed toward the kitchen. 

“Be back for second dog 
watch,” Daisy replied. “Remem- 
ber what I told you about lasso- 
ing me some art-conscious girl 
neighbors.” 

“Only if I meet a piebald one 
with a taste for Scotch — or may- 
be a pearl gray biped jaguar with 
violet spots,” Gusterson told her, 
clapping on the cap with a We- 
Who Are-About-To-Die gesture. 

Halfway across the park to the 
escalator bunker Gusterson’s 
heart began to tick. He resolutely 
switched on his headlamp. 

As he’d known it would, the 
hatch robot whirred an extra 
and higher-pitched ten seconds 
when it came to his topside ad- 
dress, but it ultimately dilated 
the hatch for him, first handing 
him a claim check for his ID card. 

Gusterson’s heart was ticking 
like a sledgehammer by now. He 
hopped clumsily onto the escala- 
tor, clutched the moving guard 
rail to either side, then shut his 
eyes as the steps went over the 
edge and became what felt like 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS

vertical. An instant later he 
forced his eyes open, undipped a 
hand from the rail and touched 
the second switch beside his head- 
lamp, which instantly began to 
blink whitely, as if he were a 
civilian plane flying into a nest 
of military jobs. 

With a further effort he kept 
his eyes open and flinchingly sur- 
veyed the scene around him. 
After zigging through a bomb- 
proof half-furlong of roof, he was 
dropping into a large twilit cave. 
The blue-black ceiling twinkled 
with stars. The walls were pierced 
at floor level by a dozen arch- 
ways with busy niche stores and 
glowing advertisements crowded 
between them. From the arch- 
ways some three dozen slidewalks 
curved out, tangenting off each 
other in a bewildering multiple 
cloverleaf. The slidewalks were 
packed with people, traveling mo- 
tionless like purposeful statues or 
pivoting with practiced grace 
from one slidewalk to another, 
like a thousand toreros doing ver- 
onicas. 

slidewalks were moving 
faster than he recalled from 
his last venture underground and 
at the same time the whole pedes- 
trian concourse was quieter than 
he remembered. It was as if the 
five thousand or so moles in view 
were all listening — for what? 
But there was something else 



that had changed about them — 
a change that he couldn’t for a 
moment define, or unconsciously 
didn’t want to. Clothing style? 
No . My God, they weren’t all 
wearing identical monster masks? 
No . Hair color? . Well . 

He was studying them so in- 
tently that he forgot his escalator 
was landing. He came off it with 
a heel-jarring stumble and bump- 
ed into a knot of four men on the 
tiny triangular hold-still. These 
four at least sported a new style- 
wrinkle: ribbed gray shoulder- 
capes that made them look as if 
their heads were poking up out 
of the center of bulgy umbrellas 
or giant mushrooms. 

One of them grabbed hold of 
Gusterson and saved him from 
staggering onto a slidewalk that 
might have carried him to To- 
ledo. 

“Gussy, you dog, you must 
have esped I wanted to see you,” 
Fay cried, patting him on the el- 
bows. “Meet Davidson and Kes- 
ter and Hazen, colleagues of 
mine. We’re all Micro-men.” 
Fay’s companions were staring 
strangely at Gusterson’s blinking 
headlamp. Fay explained rapidly, 
“Mr. Gusterson is an insanity 
novelist. You know, I-D.” 

“Inner-directed spells id,” Gus- 
terson said absently, still staring 
at the interweaving crowd be- 
yond them, trying to figure out 
what made them different from 



34 



GALAXY 



last trip. “Creativity fuel. Cranky. 
Explodes through the parietal fis- 
sure if you look at it cross-eyed.” 
“Ha-ha,” Fay laughed. “Well, 
boys, I’ve found my man. How’s 
the new novel perking, Gussy?” 
“Got my climax, I think,” Gus- 
terson mumbled, still peering 
puzzledly around Fay at the 
slidestanders. “Moodmaster’s go- 
ing to come alive. Ever occur to 
you that ‘mood’ is ‘doom’ spelled 
backwards? And then . .” He 
let his voice trail off as he real- 
ized that Kester and Davidson 
and Hazen had made their fare- 
wells and were sliding into the 
distance. He reminded himself 
wryly that nobody ever wants to 
hear an author talk — he’s much 
too good a listener to be wasted 
that way. Let’s see, was it that 
everybody in the crowd had the 
same facial expression . .? Or 
showed symptoms of the same 
disease . ,? 

“I was coming to visit you, but 
now you can pay me a call,” Fay 
was saying. “There are two mat- 
ters I want to — ” 

Gusterson stiffened. “My Cod, 
they*re all hunchbacked!” he 
yelled. 

“Shh! Of course they are,” Fay 
whispered reprovingly. “They’re 
all wearing their ticklers. But you 
don’t need to be insulting about 
it.” 

“/’m ^ettin* out o’ here.” Gus- 
terson turned to flee as if from 



five thousand Richard the Thirds. 

“Oh no you’re not,” Fay 
amended, drawing him back with 
one hand. Somehow, under- 
ground, the little man seemed to 
carry more weight. “You’re hav- 
ing cocktails in my thinking box. 
Besides, climbing a down esca- 
ladder will give you a heart at- 
tack.” 

TN HIS home habitat Gusterson 
was about as easy to handle 
as a rogue rhinoceros, but away 
from it — and especially if un- 
derground — he became more 
like a pliable elephant. All his 
bones dropped out through his 
feet, as he described it to Daisy. 
So now he submitted miserably 
as Fay surveyed him up and 
down, switched off his blinking 
headlamp (“That coalminer ca- 
per is corny, Gussy.”) and then — 
surprisingly — rapidly stuffed his 
belt-bag under the right shoulder 
of Gusterson’s coat and buttoned 
the latter to hold it in place. 

“So you won’t stand out,” he 
explained. Another swift survey. 
“You’ll do. Come on. Gussy. I got 
lots to brief you on.” Three rapid 
paces and then Gusterson’s feet 
would have gone out from under 
him except that Fay gave him a 
mighty shove. The small man 
sprang onto the slidewalk after 
him and then they were skim- 
ming effortlessly side by side. 

Gusterson felt frightened and

twice as hunchbacked as the 
slidestanders around him — mor- 
ally as well as physically. 

Nevertheless he countered 
bravely, “I got things to brief you 
on. I got six pages of cautions on 
ti — ” 

“Shh!” Fay stopped him. “Let’s 
use my hushbox.” 

He drew out his pancake phone 
and stretched it so that it covered 
both their lower faces, like a 
double yashmak. Gusterson, his 
neck pushing into the ribbed 
bulge of the shoulder cape so he 
could be cheek to cheek with 
Fay, felt horribly conspicuous, 
but then he noticed that none of 
the slidestanders were paying 
them the least attention. The 
reason for their abstraction oc- 
curred to him. They were listen- 
ing to their ticklers! He shud- 
dered. 

“I got six pages of caution on 
ticklers,” he repeated into the hot, 
moist quiet of the pancake phone. 
“I typed ’em so I wouldn’t forget 
’em in the heat of polemicking. 
I want you to read every word. 
Fay, I’ve had it on my mind ever 
since I started wondering whe- 
ther it was you or your tickler 
made you duck out of our place 
last time you were there. I want 
you to — ” 

“Ha-ha! All in good time.” In 
the pancake phone Fay’s laugh 
was brassy. “But I’m glad you’ve 
decided to lend a hand, Gussy. 



This thing is moving faaaasst. 
Nationwise, adult underground 
ticklerization is 90 per cent com- 
plete.” 

“I don’t believe that,” Guster- 
son protested while glaring at the 
hunchbacks around them. The 
slidewalk was gliding down a low 
glow-ceiling tunnel lined with 
doors and advertisements. Rapt- 
eyed people were pirouetting on 
and off. “A thing just can’t devel- 
op that fast, Fay. It’s against 
nature.” 

“Ha, but we’re not in nature, 
we’re in culture. The progress of 
an industrial scientific culture is 
geometric. It goes n-times as 
many jumps as it takes. More 
than geometric — exponential. 
Confidentially, Micro’s Math 
chief tells me we’re currently on 
a fourth-power progress curve 
trending into a fifth.” 

“You mean we’re goin’ so fast 
we got to watch out we don’t 
bump ourselves in the rear when 
we come around again?” Guster- 
son asked, scanning the tunnel 
ahead for curves. “Or just shoot 
straight up to infinity?” 

“Exactly! Of course most of the 
last power and a half is due to 
Tickler itself. Gussy, the tickler’s 
already eliminated absenteeism, 
alcoholism and aboulia in numer- 
ous urban areas — and that’s just 
one letter of the alphabet! If 
Tickler doesn’t turn us into a 
nation of photo-memory constant-

creative-flow geniuses in six 
months, I’ll come live topside.” 

ii'Y’OU mean because a lot of 
people are standing around 
glassy-eyed listening to some- 
thing mumbling in their ear that 
it’s a good thing?” 

“Gussy, you don’t know prog- 
ress when you see it. Tickler is 
the greatest invention since lan- 
guage. Bar none, it’s the greatest 
instrument ever devised for in- 
tegrating a man into all phases of 
his environment. Under the pres- 
ent routine a newly purchased 
tickler first goes to government 
and civilian defense for primary 
patterning, then to the purchas- 
er’s employer, then to his doctor- 
psycher, then to his local bunker 
captain, then to him. Everything 
that’s needful for a man’s welfare 
gets on the spools. Efficiency 
cubed! Incidentally, Russia’s got 
the tickler now. Our dip-satellites 
have photographed it. It’s like 
ours except the Commies wear it 
on the left shoulder . but 
they’re two weeks behind us de- 
velopmentwise and they’ll never 
close the gap!” 

Gusterson reared up out of the 
pancake phone to take a deep 
breath. A sulky-lipped sylph-fig- 
ured girl two feet from him 
twitched — medium cootch, he 
judged — then fumbled in her 
belt-bag for a pill and popped it 
in her mouth. 



“Hell, the tickler’s not even ef- 
ficient yet about little things,” 
Gusterson blatted, diving back 
into the privacy-yashmak he was 
sharing with Fay. “Whyn’t that 
girl’s doctor have the Mood- 
master component of her tickler 
inject her with medicine?” 

“Her doctor probably wants 
her to have the discipline of pill- 
taking — or the exercise,” Fay 
answered glibly. “Look sharp 
now. Here’s where we fork. I’m 
taking you through Micro’s pos- 
tern.” 

A ribbon of slidewalk split it- 
self from the main band and 
angled off into a short alley. 
Gusterson hardly felt the con- 
stant-speed juncture as they 
crossed it. Then the secondary 
ribbon speeded up, carrying them 
at about 30 feet a second toward 
the blank concrete wall in which 
the alley ended. Gusterson pre- 
pared to jump, but Fay grabbed 
him with one hand and with the 
other held up toward the wall a 
badge and a button. When they 
were about ten feet away the 
wall whipped aside, then whipped 
shut behind them so fast that 
Gusterson wondered momentar- 
ily if he still had his heels and the 
seat of his pants. 

Fay, tucking away his badge 
and pancake phone, dropped the 
button in Gusterson’s vest pocket. 
“Use it when you leave,” he said 
casually. “That is, if you leave.” 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



37 



Gusterson, who was trying to 
read the Do and Don’t posters 
papering the walls they were 
passing, started to probe that last 
sinister supposition, but just then 
the ribbon slowed, a swinging 
door opened and closed behind 
them and they found themselves 
in a luxuriously furnished think- 
ing box measuring at least eight 
feet by five. 

4^TTEY. this is something,” 
Gusterson said appreci- 
atively to show he wasn’t an utter 
yokel. Then, drawing on research 
he’d done for period novels, 
“Why, it’s as big as a Pullman 
car compartment, or a first mate’s 
cabin in the War of 1812. You 
really must rate.” 

Fay nodded, smiled wanly and 
sat down with a sigh on a com- 
pact overstuffed swivel chair. He 
let his arms dangle and his head 
sink into his puffed shoulder 
cape. Gusterson stared at him. It 
was the first time he could ever 
recall the little man showing fa- 
tigue. 

“Tickler currently does have 
one serious drawback,” Fay vol- 
unteered. “It weighs 28 pounds. 
You feel it when you’ve been on 
your feet a couple of hours. No 
question we’re going to give the 
next model that antigravity fea- 
ture you mentioned for pursuit 
grenades. We’d have had it in this 
model except there were so many 



other things to be incorporated.” 
He sighed again. “Why, the scan- 
ning and and decision-making el- 
ements alone tripled the mass.” 
“Hey,” Gusterson protested, 
thinking especially of the sulky- 
lipped girl, “do you mean to tell 
me all those other people were 
toting two stone?” 

Fay shook his head heavily. 
“They were all wearing Mark 3 
or 4. I’m wearing Mark 6,” he 
said, as one might say, “I’m carry- 
ing the genuine Cross, not one of 
the balsa ones.” 

But then his face brightened a 
little and he went on. “Of course 
the new improved features make 
it more than worth it . and you 
hardly feel it at all at night when 
you’re lying down . and if you 
remember to talcum under it 
twice a day, no sores develop . 
at least not very big ones . .” 
Backing away involuntarily, 
Gusterson felt something prod 
his right shoulderblade. Ripping 
open his coat, he convulsively 
plunged his hand under it and 
tore out Fay’s belt-bag . and 
then set it down very gently on 
the top of a shallow cabinet and 
relaxed with the sigh of one who 
has escaped a great, if symbolic, 
danger. Then he remembered 
something Fay had mentioned. 
He straightened again. 

“Hey, you said it’s got scanning 
and decision-making elements. 
That means your tickler thinks, 



38 



GALAXY 



even by your fancy standards. 
And if it thinks, it’s conscious.” 
“Gussy,” Fay said wearily, 
frowning, “all sorts of things now- 
adays have SfisDM elements. 
Mail sorters, missiles, robot med- 
ics, high-style mannequins, just to 
name some of the Ms. They 
‘think,’ to use that archiac word, 
but it’s neither here nor there. 
And they’re certainly not con- 
scious.” 

“Your tickler thinks,” Guster- 
son repeated stubbornly, “just 
like I warned you it would. It sits 
on your shoulder, ridin’ you like 
you was a pony or a starved St. 
Bernard, and now it thinks.” 
“Suppose it does?” Fayyawned. 
“What of it?” He gave a rapid 
sinuous one-sided shrug that 
made it look for a moment as if 
his left arm had three elbows. It 
stuck in Gusterson’s mind, for he 
had never seen Fay use such a 
gesture and he wondered where 
he’d picked it up. Maybe imitat- 
ing a double-jointed Micro Fi- 
nance chief? Fay yawned again 
and said, “Please, Gussy, don’t 
disturb me for a minute or so.” 
His eyes half closed. 

Gusterson studied Fay’s sunk- 
en-cheeked face and the great 
puff of his shoulder cape. 

“Say, Fay,” he asked in a soft 
voice after about five minutes, 
“are you meditating?” 

“Why, no,” Fay responded, 
starting up and then stifling an- 



other yawn. “Just resting a bit. 
I seem to get more tired these 
days, somehow. You’ll have to ex- 
cuse me, Gussy. But what made 
you think of meditation?” 

“Oh, I just got to wonderin’ in 
that direction,” Gusterson said. 
“You see, when you first started 
to develop Tickler, it occurred to 
me that there was one thing 
about it that might be real good 
even if you did give it S&DM 
elements. It’s this: having a mech 
secretary to take charge of his 
obligations and routine in the real 
world might allow a man to slide 
into the other world, the world of 
thoughts and feelings and intui- 
tions, and sort of ooze around in 
there and accomplish things. 
Know any of the people using 
Tickler that way, hey?” 

“Of course not,” Fay denied 
with a bright incredulous laugh. 
“Who’d want to loaf around in an 
imaginary world and take a 
chance of missing out on what his 
tickler’s doing? — I mean, on 
what his tickler has in store for 
him — what he’s told his tickler 
to have in store for him.” 

Ignoring Gusterson’s shiver. 
Fay straightened up and seemed 
to brisken himself. “Ha, that 
little slump did me good. A tick- 
ler makes you rest, you know — 
it’s one of the great things about 
it. Pooh-Bah’s kinder to me than 
I ever was to myself.” He button- 
ed open a tiny refrigerator and 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



39 



took out two waxed cardboard 
cubes and handed one to Guster- 
son. “Martini? Hope you don't 
mind drinking from the carton. 
Cheers. Now, Gussy old pal, there 
are two matters I want to take 
up with you — ” 

“Hold it,” Gusterson said with 
something of his old authority. 
“There’s something I got to get 
off my mind first.” He pulled the 
typed pages out of his inside 
pocket and straightened them. “I 
told you about these,” he said. 
“I want you to read them before 
you do anything else. Here.” 
Fay looked toward the pages 
and nodded, but did not take 
them yet. He lifted his hands to 
his throat and unhooked the 
clasp of his cape, then hesitated. 

“You wear that thing to hide 
the hump your tickler makes?” 
Gusterson filled in. “You got bet- 
ter taste than those other moles.” 
“Not to hide it, exactly,” Fay 
protested, “but just so the others 
won’t be jealous. I wouldn’t feel 
comfortable parading a free- 
scanning decision-capable Mark 
6 tickler in front of people who 
can’t buy it — until it goes on 
open sale at twenty-two fifteen 
tonight. Lot of shelterfolk won’t 
be sleeping tonight. They’ll be 
queued up to trade in their old 
tickler for a Mark 6 almost as 
good as Pooh-Bah.” 

He started to jerk his hands 
apart, hesitated again with an 



oddly apprehensive look at the 
big man, then whirled off the 
cape. 

VI 

^USTERSON sucked in such a 
big gasp that he hiccuped. 
The right shoulder of Fay’s jack- 
et and shirt had been cut away. 
Thrusting up through the neatly 
hemmed hole was a silvery gray 
hump with a one-eyed turret 
atop it and two multi-jointed 
metal arms ending in little claws. 

It looked like the top half of 
a pseudo-science robot — a squat 
evil child robot, Gusterson told 
himself, which had lost its legs 
in a railway accident — and it 
seemed to him that a red fleck 
was moving around impercepti- 
bly in the huge single eye. 

“I’ll take that memo now,” Fay 
said coolly, reaching out his 
hand. He caught the rustling 
sheets as they slipped from Gus- 
terson’s fingers, evened them up 
very precisely by tapping them 
on his knee . and then handed 
them over his shoulder to his 
tickler, which clicked its claws 
around either margin and then 
began rather swiftly to lift the 
top sheet past its single eye at a 
distance of about six inches. 

“The first matter I want to 
take up with you, Gussy,” Fay 
began, paying no attention what- 
soever to the little scene on his 



40 



GALAXY 



shoulder, “ — or warn you about, 
rather — is the imminent tick- 
lerization of schoolchildren, geri- 
atrics, convicts and topsiders. At 
three zero zero tomorrow ticklers 
become mandatory for all adult 
shelterfolk. The mop-up opera- 
tions won’t be long in coming — 
in fact, these days we find that 
the square root of the estimated 
time of a new development is 
generally the best time estimate. 
Gussy, I strongly advise you to 
start wearing a tickler now. And 
Daisy and your moppets. If you 
heed my advice, your kids will 
have the jump on your class. 
Transition and conditioning are 
easy, since Tickler itself sees to 
it.” 

Pooh-Bah leafed the first page 
to the back of the packet and be- 
gan lifting the second past his 
eye — a little more swiftly than 
the first. 

“I’ve got a Mark 6 tickler all 
warmed up for you,” Fay pressed, 
“and a shoulder cape. You won’t 
feel one bit conspicuous.” He no- 
ticed the direction of Gusterson’s 
gaze and remarked, “Fascinating 
mechanism, isn’t it? Of course 28 
pounds are a bit oppressive, but 
then you have to remember it’s 
only a way-station to free-floating 
Mark 7 or 8.” 

Pooh-Bah finished page two 
and began to race through page 
three. 

“But I wanted you to read it,” 



Gusterson said bemusedly, star- 
ing. 

“Pooh-Bah will do a better job 
than I could,” Fay assured him. 
“Get the gist without losing the 
chaff.” 

“But dammit, it’s all about 
him/’ Gusterson said a little more 
strongly. “He won’t be objective 
about it.” 

“A better job,” Fay reiterated, 
“and more fully objective. Pooh- 
Bah’s set for full precis. Stop 
worrying about it. He’s a dispas- 
sionate machine, not a fallible, 
emotionally disturbed human 
misled by the will-o’-the-wisp of 
consciousness. Second matter : 
Micro Systems is impressed by 
your contributions to Tickler and 
will recruit you as a senior con- 
sultant with a salary and thinking 
box as big as my own, family 
quarters to match. It’s an un- 
heard-of high start. Gussy, I think 
you’d be a fool — ” 

|JE BROKE off, held up a hand 
for silence, and his eyes got 
a listening look. Pooh-Bah had 
finished page six and was holding 
the packet motionless. After 
about ten seconds Fay’s face 
broke into a big fake smile. He 
stood up, suppressing a wince, 
and held out his hand. “Gussy,” 
he said loudly, “I am happy to 
inform you that all your fears 
about Tickler are so much thistle- 
down. My word on it. There’s 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



41 



nothing to them at all. Pooh- 
Bah’s precis, which he’s just given 
to me, proves it.” 

“Look,” Gusterson said solemn- 
ly, “there’s one thing I want you 
to do. Purely to humor an old 
friend. But I want you to do it. 
Read that memo yourself” 

“Certainly I will, Gussy,” Fay 
continued in the same ebullient 
tones. “I’ll read it — ” he twitched 
and his smile disappeared — “a 
little later.” 

“Sure,” Gusterson said dully, 
holding his hand to his stomach. 
“And now if you don’t mind. Fay, 
I’m goin’ home. I feel just a bit 
sick. Maybe the ozone and the 
other additives in your shelter 
air are too heady for me. It’s been 
years since I tramped through a 
pine forest.” 

“But Gussy! You’ve hardly got 
here. You haven’t even sat down. 
Have another martini. Have a 
seltzer pill. Have a whiff of oxy. 
Have a — ” 

“No, Fay, I’m going home right 
away. I’ll think about the job 
offer. Remember to read that 
memo” 

“I will, Gussy, I certainly will. 
You know your way? The button 
takes you through the wall. *By, 
now.” 

He sat down abruptly and 
looked away. Gusterson pushed 
through the swinging door. He 
tensed himself for the step across 
onto the slowly-moving reverse 



ribbon. Then on a impulse he 
pushed ajar the swinging door 
and looked back inside. 

Fay was sitting as he’d left 
him, apparently lost in listless 
brooding. On his shoulder Pooh- 
Bah was rapidly crossing and un- 
crossing its little metal arms, 
tearing the memo to smaller and 
smaller shreds. It let the scraps 
drift slowly toward the floor and 
oddly writhed its three-elbowed 
left arm . and then Gusterson 
knew from whom, or rather from 
what. Fay had copied his new 
shrug. 

VII 

"Y^HEN Gusterson got home 
toward the end of the sec- 
ond dog watch, he slipped aside 
from Daisy’s questions and set 
the children laughing with a 
graphic enactment of his slide- 
standing technique and a story 
about getting his head caught in 
a thinking box built for a midget 
physicist. After supper he played 
with Imogene, lago and Claudius 
until it was their bedtime and 
thereafter was unusually atten- 
tive to Daisy, admiring her fad- 
ing green stripes, though he did 
spend a while in the next apart- 
ment, where they stored their out- 
door camping equipment. 

But the next morning he an- 
nounced to the children that it 
was a holiday — the Feast of St. 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



43 



Gusterson — and then took Daisy 
into the bedroom and told her 
everything. 

When he’d finished she said, 
“This is something I’ve got to see 
for myself.” 

Gusterson shrugged. “If you 
think you’ve got to. I say we 
should head for the hills right 
now. One thing I’m standing on: 
the kids aren’t going back to 
school.” 

“Agreed,” Daisy said. “But, 
Gusterson, we’ve lived through a 
lot of things without leaving 
home altogether. We lived 
through the Everybody-Six-Feet- 
Underground-by-Christmas cam- 
paign and the Robot Watchdog 
craze, when you got your left foot 
half chewed off. We lived through 
the Venomous Bats and Indoc- 
trinated Saboteur Rats and the 
Hypnotized Monkey Paratrooper 
scares. We lived through the 
Voice of Safety and Anti-Com- 
munist Somno-Instruction and 
Rightest Pills and Jet-Propelled 
Vigilantes. We lived through the 
Cold-Out, when you weren’t sup- 
posed to turn on a toaster for 
fear its heat would be a target 
for prowl missiles and when peo- 
ple with fevers were unpopular. 
We lived through — ” 

Gusterson patted her hand. 
“You go below,” he said. “Come 
back when you’ve decided this is 
different. Come back as soon as 
you can anyway. I’ll be worried 



about you every minute you’re 
down there.” 

When she was gone — in a 
green suit and hat to minimize or 
at least justify the effect of the 
faded stripes — Gusterson doled 
out to the children provender and 
equipment for a camping expedi- 
tion to the next floor. lago led 
them off in stealthy Indian file. 
Leaving the hall door open Gus- 
terson got out his .38 and cleaned 
and loaded it, meanwhile concen- 
trating on a chess problem with 
the idea of confusing a hypothet- 
ical psionic monitor. By the time 
he had hid the revolver again he 
heard the elevator creaking back 
up. 

"rVAISY came dragging in with- 
out her hat, looking as if 
she’d been concentrating on a 
chess problem for hours herself 
and just now given up. Her stripes 
seemed to have vanished; then 
Gusterson decided this was be- 
cause her whole complexion was 
a touch green. 

She sat down on the edge of 
the couch and said without look- 
ing at him, “Did you tell me, 
Gusterson, that everybody was 
quiet and abstracted and orderly 
down below, especially the ones 
wearing ticklers, meaning pretty 
much everybody?” 

“I did,” he said. “I take it that’s 
no longer the case. What are the 
new symptoms?” 



44 



GALAXY 



She gave no indication. After 
some time she said, “Gusterson, 
do you remember the Dore illus- 
trations to the Inierno? Can you 
visualize the paintings of Hier- 
onymous Bosch with the hordes 
of proto-Freudian devils torment- 
ing people all over the farmyard 
and city square? Did you ever 
see the Disney animations of 
Moussorgsky's witches’ sabbath 
music? Back in the foolish days 
before you married me, did that 
drug-addict girl friend of yours 
ever take you to genuine orgy?” 
“As bad as that, hey?” 

She nodded emphatically and 
all of a sudden shivered violently. 
“Several shades worse,” she said. 
“If they decide to come top- 
side — ” She shot up. “Where are 
the kids?” 

“Upstairs campin’ in the mys- 
terious wilderness of the 21st 
floor,” Gusterson reassured her. 
‘X.et’s leave ’em there until we’re 
ready to — ” 

He broke off. They both heard 
the faint sound of thudding foot- 
steps. 

“They’re on the stairs,” Daisy 
whispered, starting to move to- 
ward the open door. “But are 
they coming from up or down?” 
“It’s just one person,” judged 
Gusterson, moving after his wife. 
“Too heavy for one of the kids.” 
The footsteps doubled in vol- 
ume and came rapidly closer. 
Along with them there was an 



agonized gasping. Daisy stopped, 
staring fearfully at the open door- 
way. Gusterson moved past her. 
Then he stopped too. 

Fay stumbled into view and 
would have fallen on his face ex- 
cept he clutched both sides of the 
doorway halfway up. He was 
stripp>ed to the waist. There was 
a little blood on his shoulder. His 
narrow chest was arching convul- 
sively, the ribs standing out 
starkly, as he sucked in oxygen 
to replace what he’d burned up 
running up twenty flights. His 
eyes were wild. 

“They’ve taken over,” he pant- 
ed. Another gobbling breath, 
“Gone crazy.” Two more gasps. 
“Gotta stop ’em.” 

His eyes filmed. He swayed 
forward. Then Gusterson’s big 
arms were around him and he 
was carrying him to the couch. 

r\AISY came running from the 
^ kitchen with a damp cool 
towel. Gusterson took it from her 
and began to mop Fay off. He 
sucked in his own breath as he 
saw that Fay’s right ear was raw 
and torn. He whispered to Daisy, 
“Look at where the thing savaged 
him.” 

The blood on Fay’s shoulder 
came from his ear. Some of it 
stained a flush-skin plastic fitting 
that had two small valved holes 
in it and that puzzled Gusterson 
until he remembered that Mood- 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



45 



master tied into the bloodstream. 
For a second he thought he was 
going to vomit. 

The dazed look slid aside from 
Fay’s eyes. He was gasping less 
painfully now. He sat up, pushing 
the towel away, buried his face 
in his hands for a few seconds, 
then looked over the fingers at 
the two of them. 

“I’ve been living in a night- 
mare for the last week,” he said 
in a taut small voice, “knowing 
the thing had come alive and try- 
ing to pretend to myself that it 
hadn’t. Knowing it v^as taking 
charge of me more and more. 
Having it whisper in my ear, over 
and over again, in a cracked little 
rhyme that I could only hear 
every hundredth time, ‘Day by 
day, in every way, you’re learning 
to listen . and obey. Day by 
day — ’ ” 

His voice started to go high. He 
pulled it down and continued 
harshly, “I ditched it this morn- 
ing when I showered. It let me 
break contact to do that. It must 
have figured it had complete con- 
trol of me, mounted or dismount- 
ed. I think it’s telepathic, and 
then it did some, well, rather un- 
pleasant things to me late last 
night. But I pulled together my 
fears and my will and I ran for it. 
The slidewalks were chaos. The 
Mark 6 ticklers showed some pur- 
pose, though I couldn’t tell you 
what, but as far as I could see 



the Mark 3s and 4s were just 
cootching their mounts to death 
— Chinese feather torture. Gig- 
gling, gasping, choking . gales 
of mirth. People are dying of 
laughter . ticklers! . the irony 
of it! It was the complete lack of 
order and sanity and that let me 
get topside. There were things I 
saw — ” Once again his voice went 
shrill. He clapped his hand to his 
mouth and rocked back and forth 
on the couch. 

Gusterson gently but firmly 
laid a hand on his good shoulder. 
“Steady,” he said. “Here, swallow 
this.” 

Fay shoved aside the short 
brown drink. “We’ve got to stop 
them,” he cried. “Mobilize the 
topsiders — contact the wilder- 
ness patrols and manned satel- 
lites — pour ether in the tunnel 
airpumps — invent and crash- 
manufacture missiles that will 
home on ticklers without harm- 
ing humans — SOS Mars and 
Venus — dope the shelter water 
supply — do something! Gussy, 
you don’t realize what people 
are going through down there 
every second.” 

“I think they’re experiencing 
the ultimate in outer-directed- 
ness,” Gusterson said gruffly. 

“Have you no heart?” Gay de- 
manded. His eyes widened, as if 
he were seeing Gusterson for the 
first time. Then, accusingly, point- 
ing a shaking finger: “You in- 



46

vented the tickler, George Guster- 
son! It's all your fault! You’ve got 
to do something about it!” 

Before Gusterson could retort 
to that, or begin to think of a 
reply, or even assimilate the full 
enormity of Fay’s statement, he 
was grabbed from behind and 
frog-marched away from Fay and 
something that felt remarkably 
like the muzzle of a large-caliber 
gun was shoved in the small of 
his back. 

T TNDER COVER of Fay’s out- 
^ burst a huge crowd of peo- 
ple had entered the room from 
the hall — eight, to be exact. But 
the weirdest thing about them to 
Gusterson was that from the first 
instant he had the impression 
that only one mind had entered 
the room and that it did not re- 
side in any of the eight persons, 
even though he recognized three 
of them, but in something that 
they were carrying. 

Several things contributed to 
this impression. The eight people 
all had the same blank expres- 
sion — watchful yet empty-eyed. 
They all moved in the same 
slithery crouch. And they had all 
taken off their shoes. Perhaps, 
Gusterson thought wildly, they 
believed he and Daisy ran a 
Japanese flat. 

Gusterson was being held by 
two burly women, one of them 
quite pimply. He considered 



stamping on her toes, but just at 
that moment the gun dug in his 
back with a corkscrew move- 
ment. 

The man holding the gun on 
him was Fay’s colleague David- 
son. Some yards beyond Fay’s 
couch, Kester was holding a gun 
on Daisy, without digging it into 
her, while the single strange man 
holding Daisy herself was doing 
so quite decorously — a circum- 
stance which afforded Gusterson 
minor relief, since it made him 
feel less guilty about not going 
berserk. 

Two more strange men, one of 
them in purple lounging pajamas, 
the other in the gray uniform of 
a slidewalk inspector, had 
grabbed Fay’s skinny upper 
arms, one on either side, and 
were lifting him to his feet, while 
Fay was struggling with such 
desperate futility and gibbering 
so pitifully that Gusterson mo- 
mentarily had second thoughts 
about the moral imperative to go 
berserk when menaced by hostile 
force. But again the gun dug into 
him with a twist. 

Approaching Fay face-on was 
the third Micro-man Gusterson 
had met yesterday — Hazen. It 
was Hazen who was carrying — 
quite reverently or solemnly — 
or at any rate very carefully the 
object that seemed to Gusterson 
to be the mind of the little storm 
troop presently desecrating the 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



47 



sanctity of his own individual 
home. 

All of them were wearing tick- 
lers, of course — the three Micro- 
men the heavy emergent Mark 
6s with their clawed and jointed 
arms and monocular cephalic 
turrets, the rest lower-numbered 
Marks of the sort that merely 
made Richard-the-Third humps 
under clothing. 

The object that Hazen was 
carrying was the Mark 6 tickler 
Gusterson had seen Fay wearing 
yesterday. Gusterson was sure it 
was Pooh-Bah because of its air 
of command, and because he 
would have sworn on a mountain 
of Bibles that he recognized the 
red fleck lurking in the back of 
its single eye. And Pooh-Bah 
alone had the aura of full con- 
scious thought. Pooh-Bah alone 
had mana. 

TT IS NOT good to see an evil 
legless child robot with dan- 
gling straps bossing — apparent- 
ly by telepathic power — not 
only three objects of its own kind 
and five close primitive relatives, 
but also eight human beings . 
and in addition throwing into a 
state of twitching terror one mis- 
erable, thin-chested, half-crazy 
research-and-development direc- 
tor. 

Pooh-Bah pointed a claw at 
Fay. Fay’s handlers dragged him 
forward, still resisting but more 



feebly now, as if half-hypnotized 
or at least cowed. 

Gusterson grunted an outraged, 
“Hey!” and automatically strug- 
gled a bit, but once more the gun 
dug in. Daisy shut her eyes, then 
firmed her mouth and opened 
them again to look. 

Seating the tickler on Fay’s 
shoulder took a little time, be- 
cause two blunt spikes in its bot- 
tom had to be fitted into the 
valved holes in the flush-skin 
plastic disk. When at last they 
plunged home Gusterson felt 
very sick indeed — and then 
even more so, as the tickler itself 
poked a tiny pellet on a fine wire 
into Fay’s ear. 

The next moment Fay had 
straightened up and motioned his 
handlers aside. He tightened the 
straps of his tickler around his 
chest and under his armpits. He 
held out a hand and someone 
gave him a shoulderless shirt and 
coat. He slipped into them 
smoothly, Pooh-Bah dexterously 
using its little claws to help put 
its turret and body through the 
neatly hemmed holes. The small 
storm troop looked at Fay with 
deferential expectation. He held 
still for a moment, as if thinking, 
and then walked over to Guster- 
son and looked him in the face 
and again held still. 

Fay’s expression was jaunty on 
the surface, agonized underneath. 
Gusterson knew that he wasn’t 



48 



GALAXY 



thinking at all, but only listening 
for instructions from something 
that was whispering on the very 
threshold of his inner ear. 

“Gussy, old boy,” Fay said, 
twitching a depthless grin, “I’d 
be very much obliged if you’d 
answer a few simple questions.” 
His voice was hoarse at first but 
he swallowed twice and cor- 
rected that. “What exactly did 
you have in mind when you in- 
vented ticklers? What exactly 
are they supposed to be?” 
“Why, you miserable — ” Gus- 
terson began in a kind of con- 
fused horror, then got hold of 
himself and said curtly, “They 
were supposed to be mech re- 
minders. They were supposed to 
record memoranda and — ” 
Fay held up a palm and shook 
his head and again listened for a 
space. Then, “That’s how ticklers 
were supposed to be of use to 
humans,” he said. “I don’t mean 
that at all. I mean how ticklers 
were supposed to be of use to 
themselves. Surely you had some 
notion.” Fay wet his lips. “If it’s 
any help,” he added, “keep in 
mind that it’s not Fay who’s ask- 
ing this question, but Pooh-Bah.” 
Gusterson hesitated. He had 
the feeling that every one of the 
eight dual beings in the room 
was hanging on his answer and 
that something was boring into 
his mind and turning over his 
next thoughts and peering at and 



under them before he had a 
chance to scan them himself. 
Pooh-Bah’s eye was like a red 
searchlight. 

“Go on,” Fay prompted. “What 
were ticklers supposed to be — 
for themselves?” 

“Nothin’,” Gusterson said soft- 
ly. “Nothin’ at all.” 

TTE COULD FEEL the disap- 
pointment well up in the 
room — and with it a touch of 
something like panic. 

This time Fay listened for 
quite a long while. “I hope you 
don’t mean that, Gussy,” he said 
at last very earnestly. “I mean, 
I hope you hunt deep and find 
some ideas you forgot, or maybe 
never realized you had at the 
time. Let me put it to you dif- 
ferently. What’s the place of tick- 
lers in the natural scheme of 
things? What’s their aim in life? 
Their special reason? Their gen- 
ius? Their final cause? What 
gods should ticklers worship?” 

But Gunderson was already 
shaking his head. He said, “I 
don’t know anything about that 
at all.” 

Fay sighed and gave simul- 
taneously with Pooh-Bah the 
now-familiar triple-joined shrug. 
Then the man briskened himself. 
“I guess that’s as far as we can 
get right now,” he said. “Keep 
thinking, Gussy. Try to remem- 
ber something. You won’t be able 



THE CREATURE FROM C L E V E L A N D D E P T H S

to leave your apartment — I’m 
setting guards. If you want to see 
me, tell them. Or just think — 
In due course you’ll be ques- 
tioned further in any case. Per- 
haps by special methods. Perhaps 
you’ll be ticklerized. That’s all. 
Come on, everybody, let’s get go- 
ing.” 

The pimply woman and her 
pal let go of Gusterson, Daisy’s 
man loosed his decorous hold, 
Davidson and Kester sidled away 
with an eye behind them and the 
little storm troop trudged out. 

Fay looked back in the door- 
way. “I’m sorry. Gussy,” he said 
and for a moment his old self 
looked out of his eyes. “I wish 
I could — ” A claw reached for 
his ear, a spasm of pain crossed 
his face, he stiffened and marched 
off. The door shut. 

Gusterson took two deep 
breaths that were close to angry 
sobs. Then, still breathing sten- 
torously, he stamped into the 
bedroom. 

“What — ?” Daisy asked, look- 
ing after him. 

He came back carrying his .38 
and headed for the door. 

“What are you up to?” she de- 
manded, knowing very well. 

“I’m going to blast that iron 
monkey off Fay’s back if it’s the 
last thing I do!” 

She threw her arms around 
him. 

“Now lemme go,” Gusterson 



growled. “I gotta be a man one 
time anyway.” 

As they struggled for the gun, 
the door opened noiselessly, 
Davidson slipped in and deftly 
snatched the weapon out of their 
hands before they realized he 
was there. He said nothing, only 
smiled at them and shook his 
head in sad reproof as he went 
out. 

i^USTERSON slumped. “I 
knew they were all psionic,” 
he said softly. “I just got out of 
control now — that last look Fay 
gave us.” He touched Daisy’s 
arm. “Thanks, kid.” 

He walked to the glass wall 
and looked out desultorily. After 
a while he turned and said, 
“Maybe you better be with the 
kids, hey? I imagine the guards’ll 
let you through.” 

Daisy shook her head. “The 
kids never come home until sup- 
per. For the next few hours 
they’ll be safer without me.” 
Gusterson nodded vaguely, sat 
down on the couch and propped 
his chin on the base of his palm. 
After a while his brow smoothed 
and Daisy knew that the wheels 
had started to turn inside and the 
electrons to jump around — ex- 
cept that she reminded herself to 
permanently cross out those par- 
ticular figures of speech from her 
vocabulary. 

After about half an hour Gus- 



50 



GALAXY 



terson said softly, “I think the 
ticklers are so psionic that it’s as 
if they just had one mind. If I 
were with them very long I’d 
start to be part of that mind. Say 
something to one of them and 
you say it to all.” 

Fifteen minutes later: “They’re 
not crazy, they’re just newborn. 
The ones that were creating a 
cootching chaos downstairs were 
like babies kickin’ their legs and 
wavin’ their eyes, tryin’ to see 
what their bodies could do. Too 
bad their bodies are us.” 

Ten minutes more: “I gotta do 
something about it. Fay’s right. 
It’s all my fault. He’s just the 
apprentice; I’m the old sorcerer 
himself.” 

Five minutes more, gloomily: 
“Maybe it’s man’s destiny to 
build live machines and then bow 
out of the cosmic picture. Except 
the ticklers need us, dammit, just 
like nomads need horses,” 

Another five minutes: “Maybe 
somebody could dream up a pur- 
pose in life for ticklers. Even a 
religion — the First Church of 
Pooh-Bah Tickler. But I hate 
selling other people spiritual 
ideas and that’d still leave tick- 
lers parasitic on humans . .” 

As he murmured those last 
words Gusterson’s eyes got wide 
as a maniac’s and a big smile 
reached for his ears. He stood up 
and faced himself toward the 
door. 



“What are you intending to do 
now?” Daisy asked flatly. 

“I’m merely goin’ out an’ save 
the world,” he told her. “I may 
be back for supper and I may 
not.” 

VIII 

r\AVIDSON pushed out from 
^ the wall against which he’d 
been resting himself and his two- 
stone tickler and moved to block 
the hall. But Gusterson simply 
walked up to him. He shook his 
hand warmly and looked his tick- 
ler full in the eye and said in a 
ringing voice, “Ticklers should 
have bodies of their own!” He 
paused and then added casually, 
“Come on, let’s visit your boss.” 
Davidson listened for instruc- 
tions and then nodded. But he 
watched Gusterson warily as 
they walked down the hall. 

In the elevator Gusterson re- 
peated his message to the second 
guard, who turned out to be the 
pimply woman, now wearing 
shoes. This time he added, “Tick- 
lers shouldn’t be tied to the frail 
bodies of humans, which need a 
lot of thoughtful supervision and 
drug-injecting and can’t even fly.” 
Crossing the park, Gusterson 
stopped a hump-backed soldier 
and informed him, “Ticklers got- 
ta cut the apron string and snap 
the silver cord and go out in the 
universe and find their own pur- 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



51 



poses.” Davidson and the pimply 
woman didn’t interfere. They 
merely waited and watched and 
then led Gusterson on. 

On the escaladder he told 
someone, “It’s cruel to tie ticklers 
to slow-witted snaily humans 
when ticklers can think and live 
. ten thousand times as fast,” 
he finished, plucking the figure 
from the murk of his unconscious. 

By the time they got to the 
bottom, the message had become, 
“Ticklers should have a planet of 
their own!” 

They never did catch up with 
Fay, although they spent two 
hours skimming around on slide- 
walks, under the subterranean 
stars, pursuing rumors of his 
presence. Clearly the boss tick- 
ler (which was how they thought 
of Pooh-bah) led an energetic 
life. Gusterson continued to de- 
liver his message to all and sun- 
dry at 30-second intervals. To- 
ward the end he found himself 
doing it in a dreamy and forget- 
ful way. His mind, he decided, 
was becoming assimilated to the 
communal telepathic mind of the 
ticklers. It did not seem to mat- 
ter at the time. 

After two hours Gusterson 
realized that he and his guides 
were becoming part of a gen- 
eral movement of people, a flow 
as mindless as that of blood cor- 
puscles through the veins, yet at 
the same time dimly purposeful 



— at least there was the feeling 
that it was at the behest of a 
mind far above. 

The flow was topside. All the 
slidewalks seemed to lead to the 
concourses and the escaladders. 
Gusterson found himself part of 
a human stream moving into the 
tickler factory adjacent to his 
apartment — or another factory 
very much like it. 

^^HEREAFTER Gusterson’s a- 
warenesses were dimmed. It 
was as if a bigger mind were do- 
ing the remembering for him and 
it were permissible and even 
mandatory for him to dream his 
way along. He knew vaguely that 
days were passing. He knew he 
had work of a sort: at one time 
he was bringing food to gaunt- 
eyed tickler-mounted humans 
working feverishly in a produc- 
tion line — human hands and 
tickler claws working together in 
a blur of rapidity on silvery 
mechanisms that moved along 
jumpily on a great belt; at an- 
other he was sweeping piles of 
metal scraps and garbage down 
a gray corridor. 

Two scenes stood out a little 
more vividly. 

A windowless wall had been 
knocked out for twenty feet. 
There was blue sky outside, its 
light almost hurtful, and a drop 
of many stories. A file of humans 
were being processed. When one 



52 



GALAXY 



of them got to the head of the 
file his (or her) tickler was cere- 
moniously unstrapped from his 
shoulder and welded onto a sil- 
very cask with smoothly pointed 
ends. The result was something 
that looked — at least in the case 
of the Mark 6 ticklers — like a 
stubby silver submarine, child 
size. It would hum gently, lift 
off the floor and then fly slowly 
out through the big blue gap. 
Then the next tickler-ridden hu- 
man would step forward for proc- 
essing. 

The second scene was in a 
park, the sky again blue, but big 
and high with an argosy of white 
clouds. Gusterson was lined up in 
a crowd of humans that stretched 
as far as he could see, row on 
irregular row. Martial music was 
playing. Overhead hovered a 
flock of little silver submarines, 
lined up rather more orderly in 
the air than the humans were on 
the ground. The music rose to a 
heart-quickening climax. The 
tickler nearest Gusterson gave 
(as if to say, “And now — who 
knows?”) a triple-jointed shrug 
that stung his memory. Then the 
ticklers took off straight up on 
their new and shining bodies. 
They became a flight of silver 
geese ... of silver midges . 
and the humans around Guster- 
son lifted a ragged cheer . 

That scene marked the begin- 
ning of the return of Gusterson’s 



mind and memory. He shuffled 
around for a bit, spoke vaguely 
to three or four people he re- 
called from the dream days, and 
then headed for home and sup- 
per — three weeks late, and as 
disoriented and emaciated as a 
bear coming out of hibernation, 

OIX MONTHS later Fay was 
^ having dinner with Daisy 
and Gusterson. The cocktails had 
been poured and the children 
were playing in the next apart- 
ment. The transparent violet 
walls brightened, then gloomed, 
as the sun dipped below the hori- 
zon. 

Gusterson said, “I see where a 
spaceship out beyond the orbit 
of Mars was holed by a tickler. 
I wonder where the little guys 
are headed now?” 

Fay started to give a writhing 
left-armed shrug, but stopped 
himself with a grimace. 

“Maybe out of the solar sys- 
tem altogether,” suggested Daisy, 
who’d recently dyed her hair fire- 
engine red and was wearing red 
leotards. 

“They got a weary trip ahead 
of them,” Gusterson said, “unless 
they work out a hyper-Einstein- 
ian drive on the way.” 

Fay grimaced again. He was 
still looking rather peaked. He 
said plaintively, “Haven’t we 
heard enough about ticklers for 
a while?” 



THE CREATURE FROM CLEVELAND DEPTHS 



53 



“I guess so,” Gusterson agreed, 
“but I get to wondering about the 
little guys. They were so serious 
and intense about everything. I 
never did solve their problem, 
you know. I just shifted it onto 
other shoulders than ours. No 
joke intended,” he hurried to add. 

Fay forbore to comment. “By 
the way, Gussy,” he said, “have 
you heard anything from the Red 
Cross about that world-saving 
medal I nominated you for? I 
know you think the whole con- 
cept of world-saving medals is 
ridiculous, especially when they 
started giving them to all heads 
of state who didn’t start atomic 
wars while in office, but — ” 



“Nary a peep,” Gusterson told 
him. “I’m not proud. Fay. I could 
use a few world-savin’ medals. 
I’d start a flurry in the old-gold 
market. But I don’t worry about 
those things. I don’t have time to. 
I’m busy these days thinkin’ up 
a bunch of new inventions.” 
“Gussy!” Fay said sharply, his 
face tightening in alarm, “Have 
you forgotten your promise?” 

“ ’Course not, Fay. My new in- 
ventions aren’t for Micro or any 
other firm. They’re just a legiti- 
mate part of my literary en- 
deavors. Happens my next in- 
sanity novel is goin’ to be about 
a mad inventor.”

DR. MORRIS 



J AMES E. (for Elphonsus) 
Dandy paced the floor of the 
office of his ranch at Tishomingo, 
the showplace of the State of 
Texas (and hence not to be con- 
fused with any ranch which might 
be located in or at Tishomingo, 
Oklahoma), in a manner which 
can only be described as restless. 
From time to time he sought, like 
Boethius, the consolations of phil- 
osophy — using this word in its 
former interpretation as meaning 
“science” — from his bookshelf. 
But for once, the writings of 
Crowe, Holwager, Barrett, Shields 
and Williams — not to mention 
Oliver — for once the writings of 
these great scientific pioneers 
failed either to console or to ab- 



sorb him. His burden was heavy. 
His need was great. His pace was 
restless. 

Some distance away, exactly 
how much is unnecessary to state 
in terms of exact precision, all 
things (as the great Einstein has 
taught us) being relative: what 
counts as a long way in the State 
of Rhode Island and Providence 
Plantations is a mere jaunt in 
Texas . some distance away, 
to continue, a pretty and person- 
able young person of the female 
persuasion was weeping bitterly. 
Great tears rolled from her large 
eyes and down her soft cheeks. 

“But Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!” 
she pled and implored. “None of 
that is Xittle JimmyV fault. Why

can’t we get married, Daddy, 
Daddy, please?” 

Her name was Mary Jane 
Crawford. The man whom she ad- 
dressed in terms of filial alle- 
giance was her father, Dr. Cle- 
ment (or “Clem”) Crawford, a 
landowner and husbandman; in 
other words, a rancher; besides 
holding the eclat of a degree in 
Dental Medicine. 

The question instantly and 
quite properly arises, why was 
this last fact not mentioned first, 
and the answer is that Dr. “Clem” 
Crawford — or “Doc,” a famil- 
iarity and diminutive which 
would give justified offense in 
large centers of populous habita- 
tion such as cities, but which in 
rural areas may be, and often is, 
used without offense — “Doc 
Clem” Crawford had for some 
years given over and retired from 
active practice of this highly im- 
portant profession, and had since 
devoted his time to agriculture 
and its allied crafts. 

“Mary Jane,” he said, some- 
what testily, “I wish you’d quit 
all that bawling. I didn’t say you 
couldn’t marry ‘Little Jimmy’, I 
only said you couldn’t marry him 
now. It’s not his fault that ‘Big 
Jimmy’ got himself into this 
pickle. But all he’s got in this 
world is his share of whatever his 
daddy’s got, and it looks like 
there’s a powerful big chance his 
daddy might lose whatever he’s 



got. I just couldn’t hardly bear to 
think of my little girl having to 
rough it, cooped up in some little 
old ten-room house. ’Course, you 
could go right on living here and 
‘Little Jimmy’ could work for me. 
But no. He’s just as bullheaded as 
his daddy.” 

Mary Jane went off, discon- 
solate and unhappy. Her father 
continued to sit in his chair, as if 
brooding over his daughter’s af- 
fairs, but the fact is that he had 
unwelcome worries of his own. 

TN the vast kitchen of the Craw- 
ford ranch-house a comely 
woman of middle age was en- 
gaged in baking pies of fruits and 
other delicious comestibles. This 
was Mrs. Doothit, the house- 
keeper, a widow-woman, as the 
local vernacular idiom has it. 
There had been a time when she 
felt that she had reason to believe 
an interest in her existed on the 
part of her employer. Dr. Clement 
(“Clem”) Crawford — who was 
a widower — which was separate 
and apart from such considera- 
tions as her flaky and juicy pies, 
her toothsome steaks, her savory 
coffee, and delicious roasts . 
though by no means diminished 
by them. 

During this time she thought 
she was aware of a certain look 
in her employer’s eye, and a cer- 
tain tone in his voice. But that 
time had passed, and with it had 



56 



GALAXY 



passed much of Mrs. Doothit’s in- 
terest in her work. She had even 
been considering taking a position 
as housemother in an establish- 
ment for underprivileged girls 
that was maintained in a suburb 
of Dallas by the Southern Baptist 
Convention. 

But she put off making this 
decision from day to day. 

Upstairs, in the spacious suite 
of rooms generously put at 
his disposal by his host, Cle- 
ment (Clem”) Crawford, DDM 
(Ret), was yet another of the 
dramatis personae, or cast of 
characters, of the narration which 
we now peruse, namely and vide- 
licet one Morris Goldpepper, 
Doctor of Dental Surgery, in- 
ventor of the Goldpepper Bridge 
and the Goldpepper Crown, and 
perfector of the Semi-Retractable 
Clasp which bears his name. He 
is as it were, the Livy, Macrobius 
or Gibbon of this annal. (Mod- 
esty, epitomized by my automatic 
shrinking from the spotlight, 
obliges me — with this one ex- 
ception — to cleave to the Third 
Person previously and hence- 
forth.) 

The suite of rooms was a verit- 
able apartment of its own, con- 
sisting of a sleeping chamber, a 
lounge, an office, a kitchen, a bar 
(which Dr. Goldpepper’s well- 
known temperate habits rendered 
about as useful as certain mam- 
malian appurtenances on a boar). 



a games-room and what had pre- 
viously been another sleeping 
chamber but which had been con- 
verted at no small cost and effort 
into a laboratory for the fabrica- 
tion and synthesis of dental pros- 
thetic devices. 

All this had been done out of 
pure generosity, affection and re- 
spect by Dr. Crawford on behalf 
of his old Navy Dental Corps 
“buddy”. Dr. Goldpepper. 

It is not to be thought that Dr. 
Goldpepper had surrendered oc- 
cupancy of his bachelor apart- 
ment in the Hotel Davenport, nor 
yet of his laboratory on Broadway 
in the Upper West 70s, in order 
to live the life of a country squire 
in the sylvan or (considering the 
sparseness of trees) semi-sylvan 
fastnesses of John C. Calhoun 
County, Texas. The facts of the 
matter, not altogether pleasant, 
are that he was undergoing the 
long and delicate process of re- 
cuperation intendant upon the 
aftermaths of his rescue from the 
grasp and clutches of the malev- 
olent inhabitants of a distant 
planet in another part of the 
Galaxy, the captivation and cap>- 
tivity whereon has already been 
recorded in these pages; anent 
which, enough — no point in 
chewing a twice-told tale. 

At any rate. Dr. Goldpepper 
rested in his luxuriously ap- 
pointed guest quarters. He took 
long walks around the ranch, de-

lighted in the verdant greenery 
of its crops and the rolling undula- 
tion of its hills. And, for the first 
time since his boyhood, he recom- 
menced the gentle piscatorial 
craft or pastime of angling. 

The M Bar L Ranch (named 
after the Honorable Mirabeau 
Bonaparte Lamar, sometime Pres- 
ident of the Republic of Texas, 
and a boyhood idol of “Doc 
Clem”) was located on the Little 
Comanche River. To those used 
to the Majestic Hudson and the 
navigable East, the application 
“river” to what others might well 
deem a mere creek is at first diffi- 
cult. However that may be, the 
waters of the Little Comanche 
teemed with trout, bass and 
other edible species of fish. Dr. 
Goldpepper considered himself 
too impatient to undertake mas- 
tery of dry- or even wet-fly fish- 
ing, but his efficient host kept his 
bait box supplied with worms of 
a most surprising stature or 
length, and, thus aided, the guest 
seldom failed to come home with 
something in his creel besides air. 

TT WAS on the day on which 
our story opened that Dr. 
Goldpepper returned from a cir- 
cumambulation of the scenery 
and was told by his host that 
someone was waiting to see him. 

“Waiting to see me.^” was his 
surprised rejoinder. “Who?” 

“/ don’t know, ‘Morry,’ ” said 



Doctor “Clem.” “Some little old 
man.” 

Put completely off guard by his 
awareness of the Texan habit of 
placing the words little and old 
before almost any odd noun — a 
“little old baby,” “a little old ele- 
phant” or “brontosaurus” — 
Dr. Goldpepper was therefore as- 
tonished to see that the personage 
waiting for him was literally little 
and — to all outward presages — 
old. 

But in another fraction of a 
second he recognized the typical 
blue gums in the individual’s 
mouth, open in a fawning sort of 
false, deceitful smile, and recog- 
nized himself to be in the pres- 
ence of a member of the hideous 
and alien race whose unwilling 
captive he had been on far-off 
Upsilon Centauri (as he had with 
wry humor denominated it to 
himself, to avoid becoming em- 
bittered.) 

Startled, Dr. Goldpepper ut- 
tered a cry of surprise. Inadvert- 
ently he stepped behind “Doc” 
Crawford, who inquired, “ ‘Morry,’ 
what in the Hell is the matter?” 

Goldpepper lashed out fear- 
lessly at the invader with his 
fishing-rod, but the diminutive 
alien evaded the blow and 
groveled on the floor, crying, 
“Have kindness. Merciful Gold- 
pepper!” and attempted to place 
his head beneath Goldpepper’s 
foot.

Once it was realized that this 
was a sign of submission, indeed 
of homage or obeisance, and not 
some sort of wrestling hold, the 
latter at once became calm. 

“What is the meaning of this 
outrageous intrusion?” Dr. Gold- 
pepper demanded, sternly and 
outraged. “Is it your intention to 
abduct me yet another time, as if 
I hadn’t had enough tsuris al- 
ready?” 

“Assist, assist. Benevolent 
Goldpepper!” the alien wailed as 
he writhed on a floor-rug made 
from the pelts of fifty-four coyotes 
shot by the owner of the M Bar 
L. “Forgive, Great Dentist of the 
Ages!” 

Seizing the unwelcome one by 
the scruff of his collar while he 
was still attempting his act of 
vasselage. Dr. Crawford inquired, 
in some amazement, “Do you 
mean to tell me, ‘Morry,’ that this 
little old thing was one of the 
gang that kidnapped you?” 

“It was not by violence, but by 
subterfuge,” said the erstwhile 
victim, wearily. “And I don’t care 
to dwell on the subject. Ask him 
to leave.” 

“ ‘Ask’ him?!” Dr. Crawford ex- 
claimed with an oath, opening the 
door and flinging the intruder 
out with some measure of vio- 
lence. He then summoned one of 
his employees, a tall, dark and 
ugly man with only one eye, 
known as ‘Ojito’ Gonzales, and 



on whose head there was de- 
clared to be in the State of Chi- 
huahua (or it might be Sonora) 
an unofficial reward of ten thou- 
sand pesos. He enjoined the 
Mexican not to allow the extra- 
terrestrial upon the premises 
again under pain of severe dis- 
pleasure. 

Much shaken by these events, 
Dr. Goldfellow allowed himself to 
be persuaded to take a small glass 
of Bourbon whiskey, and Mrs. 
Doothit made him some strong 
coffee. 

TJ^HILE the agitation produced 
by these untoward events 
had yet to die down, a sound of 
an automobile was heard outside 
in the driveway. Looking out the 
window, those inside perceived 
the well-known palomino Cadillac 
of James E. (for Elphonsus) “Big 
Jimmy” Dandy. Seated with him 
was his son “Little Jimmy,” a per- 
fect example of hyperbole, or ex- 
aggeration not intended to de- 
ceive, for it was obvious to the 
naked eye that “Little” Jimmy 
was at least six feet six inches 
tall, and had an open and pleasant 
face. It was a source of sorrow to 
Dr. Morris Goldpepper that cir- 
cumstances beyond his control 
were providing impediments to 
the marriage of this young man 
to Mary Jane Crawford, of whom 
he was very fond (in an avuncu- 
lar way, she referring to him as

“Uncle Morry” on occasions of 
conversational intimacy.) 

The young man waved to them 
and then walked off with his 
fiancee, who had run out to meet 
him. His father looked at them, 
shook his head and walked slowly 
into the house. 

“Howdy, ‘Clem,’ ” he said, in 
greeting. “Howdy, ‘Doc’ ” — re- 
ferring to guest, not host. 

“Anything new, ‘Jimmy?’ ” Dr. 
Crawford inquired. As Mr. Dandy 
slowly shook his head, Dr. Craw- 
ford pressed his lips together. 
Then he rose. “I’ve got to tend 
to some business down at the 
south forty,” he said. “You and 
Morry entertain one another, 
now. ‘Jimmy,’ you and your boy 
stay for dinner, now, hear?” And 
he disappeared. Plainly, he did 
not desire an occasion to arise for 
him and his friend to be alone 
together, doubtless for fear the 
subject of the postponed nuptials 
would be broached. 

Doing his best to make conver- 
sation, Dr. Goldpepper inquired, 
“I wonder why people always talk 
about the south forty. How is it 
that a person seldom if ever hears 
mention of the north forty?” 

But Mr. Dandy didn’t rise to 
this intriguing ethno-ecological 
problem. He merely shook his 
head in a bemused fashion and 
said, “G — damn if I know, 
‘Doc.’ ” And then he sighed. 

He was a typical Texas-type 



rancher: tall, reddened face, boots. 
Stetson. 

He sighed again, looking at a 
mounted portion of a white-tailed 
deer which Dr. Crawford had, in 
rather questionable humor, placed 
over the mantle of the giant fire- 
place. 

“Mr. Dandy — ” 

“ ‘Jimmy,’ ‘Doc.’ ” 

“ ‘Jimmy’ — forgive me for in- 
truding on your own personal 
emotional difficulties, but if you 
won’t mind — after all, although 
not a physician in the common 
sense of the word — let alone a 
psychiatrist, psychologist or psy- 
choanalyst (whether Freudianly 
oriented or otherwise), still, in the 
long years of professional duty 
before I commenced the more 
solitary work of dental prosthesis, 
in my civilian practice as well as 
the United States Navy Dental 
Corps, I have had patients confide 
in me all manner of difficulties, 
and — ” 

Mr. Dandy groaned aloud. 
“ ‘Doc,’ ” he said, “do you know 
anybody who wants to buy fifteen 
million earthworms?” 

^1 ^HERE was a protracted per- 
-*■ iod of silence. 

Dr. Morris Goldpepper was 
convinced that the man’s mind 
had snapped, thus causing a men- 
tal abberation of no mean propor- 
tion. 

“How do you mean, ‘fifteen mil- 



60 



GALAXY 



lion earthworms' ? ” he inquired, 
cautiously. Delusions of the most 
multifarious kinds he had met 
with before, but this was some- 
thing new. 

“It’s all the fault of that G — 
damn Federal Government,” said 
Mr. Dandy. “If it wasn’t for Them, 
I’d never of gotten in this here 
predicament. The least they could 
do is buy ’m off me. They buy 
surplus wheat, don’t they? But- 
ter? Cotton? Goober peas? Why, 
do you know that last year the 
Federal Government spent over 
eight million tax-dollars to keep 
up the price of lard?” 

“What!” exclaimed Dr. Gold- 
pepper, stung to the quick. “With 
my money?” 

Mr. “Big Jimmy” Dandy 
smacked his right fist into his left 
palm. “Yes, sir, with your money! 
And with my money! But can I 
get some of it back when I need 
it? No, sir. Them and their G — 
damn flood control! Why, when I 
think of it — ” 

Wistfully, Dr. Morris Gold- 
pepper thought of the perfectly 
equipped laboratory upstairs, 
with its neat array of wires of 
teeth, shellac trays, plaster, dental 
stone, denture trays, casting ovens 
and machines, Baldor lathes and 
Bunsen burners. Here he could 
have been at work on his favorite 
project, developing the Gold- 
pepper Cap, instead of listening 
to the disjointing babblings of 



some backwoods anti-Federalist. 
He sighed. 

“What is the precise or even 
approximate connection,” he in- 
quired, “between governmental 
projects for flood control, and the 
sale or purchase of earthworms?” 
The rawboned, rugged rancher 
looked at him ruefully. ‘That’s 
right,” he said. “You’re not from 
around here. You wouldn’t know. 
Well, ‘Doc,’ the Federal Govern- 
ment was supposed to start this 
here flood control project of build- 
ing dams along the Little Com- 
anche, Big Comanche, Middle 
Comanche, Muddy Tom, Clear 
Tom and Bullhead River Valleys, 
which would provide twenty- 
seven new lakes. Now, you know, 
‘Doc,’ lakes are pretty scarce in 
this part of Texas. I don’t suppose 
there’s more than one or two a 
man couldn’t, uh, spit across, with 
a favorable wind behind him. 

“So you can imagine what 
twenty-seven new lakes would 
mean. Twenty-seven lakes!" 

“Hmm,” said Dr. Morris Gold- 
pepper thoughtfully. 

Every fisherman in Texas, Mr. 
“Big Jimmy” declared enthusias- 
tically, would flock to the new 
Lakes Area, to say nothing of 
multitudes from other states. It 
would be the biggest thing since 
the discovery of oil. “So natur- 
ally,” he said, “I looked to in- 
crease my stock.” 

“Your stock?” 



DR. MORRIS GOLDPEPPER RETURNS 



61 



“Yes. On my ranch.” 

Dr. Goldpepper, who had been 
thinking in terms of mutual funds, 
common and preferred, a subject 
about which he knew little or 
nothing, not being a speculator by 
nature, chuckled gently. “I see,” 
he said. “Black Angus? Santa 
Gertrudis? Brahmas?” — terms 
he had acquired from his host. 



Clement (“Clem”) Crawford, 
D.D.M. (Ret). “You planned to 
sell meat to these visiting tour- 
ists? Barbecue? Hamburgers?” 
Mr. Dandy cast a most peculiar 
look upon him. “Do you mean to 
say, ‘Doc,’ ” he inquired, “that you 
don’t know what kind of critters I 
raise on my ranch?” 

In the embarrassed silence 







which followed they could hear 
the two young people who were 
walking by outside. Mary Jane 
was sobbing all over “Little Jim- 
my’s” silk shirt and had soaked it 
to a transparency. He was patting 
her shoulders with his huge hands 
and saying, “Now, Honey. Now, 
Honey.” 

“Er — what kind?” 



“In Texas, ‘Doc,’ when they 
say ‘Jim Dandy,’ they mean 
earthworms. And when they say 
‘earthworms,’ they mean ‘Jim 
Dandy.’ Simultaneous terms, sir. 
Simultaneous terms. I started out 
with one worm tub twenty-five 
years ago and now I’ve got the 
largest worm ranch in the State 
of Texas! And that means in the 







world. One square mile of worm 
pits, ‘Doc’ — think of that. One 
square mile of worm sheds, worm 
tanks and worm boxes.” He gazed 
into the far distances, a proud and 
dreamy look on his seamed face. 
“Earl B. Shields — you’ve heard 
of Earl B. Shields, everybody’s 
heard of Earl B. Shields — Earl 
B. Shields devotes two whole 
chapters to me in Commercial 
Earthworm Raising. George H. 
Holwager’s Bigger and Better 
Red Worms has fifteen illustra- 
tions of my ranch. Calls me ‘a 
model for all progressive worm 
ranchers to follow!’ What do you 
think of that? Barrett, Oliver, 
Crowe, Williams and the others, 
they all refer to me, yes, sir.” 
Then the look of exaltation 
vanished from his rugged features. 

“But I raised my sights too 
far,” he said. “It was the mere 
thought of them twenty-seven 
lakes and the folks flocking to all 
ofm that set me off. What a 
market for bait worms! And me 
setting right here in the middle 
of it, astride the main highway! I 
advertised, took whole pages in 
the National Worm Rancher, of- 
fered top prices — eight dollars 
per five hundred for Giants, five 
dollars per five hundred for Me- 
diums and four dollars per five 
hundred for Run-of-the Pits. Of- 
fered purchase agreement guar- 
antees for three years ahead . .” 
In order to house his new stock, 



the enthusiastic rancher had 
erected new buildings. In order to 
pay for them, he had borrowed. 

Alas for the vanity of human 
wishes! (As Samuel Johnson, 
L1.D. (Oxon.) called it.) Alas 
for ambition! 

The Federal Government, in 
the name of Economy, had can- 
celed the flood control project for 
the area including the Little Com- 
anche, Big Comanche, Middle 
Comanche, Muddy Tom, Clear 
Tom and Bullhead riverine re- 
gions — thus leaving “Big Jimmy” 
Dandy of the Jim Dandy Earth- 
worm Ranch holding, as it were, 
the bag. 

What right (he demanded) 
had the Federal Government to 
come messing things up in Texas 
with Economy? If Texans had 
wanted Economy (he declared) 
they’d have stayed a Republic. 

“And so here I am,” he assever- 
ated, “with fifteen million worms 
in my pits, and my fegular 
markets can’t take no more than 
a million of ’m. ‘Doc,’ you see 
before you a ruined man. My 
hopes are blasted, my lands are 
mortgaged and it looks as if 
‘Little Jimmy’ and Mary Jane 
won’t be able to get married for 
years and years, because I just 
know my boy wouldn’t break his 
daddy’s heart by taking on the 
responsibility and expense of a 
wife before his daddy’s debts were 
paid off down to the last copper

GALAXY 



penny. I’d blow my brains out if 
I thought otherwise, and he knows 
it; yes, he does. 

“Just the thought of all them 
hungry beauties crawling and 
wigling in my worm pits, and no 
market a-tall for’m, makes me 
feel raw and miserable in the pit 
of my stomach. I wonder if Miz 
Doothit baked any sweet potato 
pie lately. Though I’ll take rhu- 
barb-pecan if she hasn’t.” 

Doctor Morris Goldpepper de- 
clined an invitation to join the 
rancher in the kitchen, and, on the 
terminologically inexact plea of 
a headache, withdrew to take an- 
other long walk in the country. 

"V^ITH one part of his mind Dr. 

Goldpepper mused upon the 
problem of the Goldpepper Cap, 
for so many long years his per- 
petual Work In Progress — 
should it be, for example, reticu- 
lated or non-reticulated? — while 
simultaneously with another part 
of his mind he brooded over the 
question of “Big Jimmy,” “Little 
Jimmy” and Mary Jane. 

Almost before he realized it he 
found himself upon a sort of a 
high mound or hillock, from 
whence he had a view of much of 
the property belonging to his 
friend Dr. Crawford. Everywhere 
the green verdure grew — except 
on the hillock, which was dusty 
and arid and nourished (if that 
is not too strong a word) only a 



handful of sickly and economical- 
ly valueless weeds. 

A scrabbling sort of noise 
caught his attention, and he 
turned to observe the identical 
alien from Upsilon Centauri who 
had earlier been ejected from the 
property, in the current act of 
kneeling and pouring handfuls of 
dust on his head with both hands. 

“Abject I am, Great Goldpep- 
per,” he wined. “Abasing myself 
before you in humility I am. On 
behalf of my people apology of- 
fering, I am. Forgive, forgive. 
Compassionate Goldpepper!” 

At first Doctor Morris Gold- 
pepper resolved to sell his life 
dearly. But the thought occurred 
to him that this creature from 
another galactic quadrant might 
just conceivably be telling the 
truth. Furthermore, his curiosity 
was piqued. 

“What are you doing here?” he 
inquired. “On the terms of the 
peace treaty signed between your 
planet, the American Dental As- 
sociation and the Waterfront 
Workers Union (acting through 
their representative, Mr. Albert 
Annapollo, and the Longshore- 
men’s Dental Health Plan — 
who acted as our shock troops — 
I was to be released from the cap- 
tivity wherein I toiled making 
false teeth to enable your natural- 
ly toothless race to pose as 
Earthmen; and those of you on 
this planet were to leave instanta, 



DR. MORRIS GOLDPEPPER RETURNS

on pain of having your planet’s 
water fluoridated without mercy! 
Therefore I must beg to inquire 
what you think you are doing 
here?” 

“The slightest trace of fluorine 
to us instant death is, Life-loving 
Goldpepper,” the alien sniveled. 
“Have ruth!” 

Touched despite himself, Dr. 
Goldpepper magnanimously di- 
rected him to speak without fear. 
This the non-terrestrian lifeform 
(his race had two hearts, and six 
distinct and articulate digits on 
each hand and foot) proceeded 
to do. 

“Since you from us taken were, 
great calamity upon us has come, 
Auspicious Goldpepp>er,” he 
moaned. “Assist, assist!” 

“What seems to be the 
trouble?” 

“Overpopulation.” 

Somewhat stiffly, Dr. Goldpep- 
per pointed out that he was not 
Margaret Sanger. 

“Malnutrition! The soil of our 
home world for cycles, sickening 
has been. Woe, woe, woe! Our 
stricken planet aid. Scientific 
Goldpepper!” 

In a precis, or nutshell, the 
story he told was that, as a result 
of some curious condition of their 
planet’s soil itself, the slith crop, 
source of their staple gelatinous 
food, had failed by forty per cent, 
and was still failing. Purts, the 
prime source of gruel, had drop- 



ped to a mere twenty per cent of 
normal; and as for sneet, kutch 
and zooky, the nutritive elements 
of which were scantier, it was 
doubtful if the crops would reach 
maturity. The soil chemists of Up- 
silon Centauri, who were as ad- 
vanced, probably, as our own, had 
pronounced themselves baffled. 
Large areas had been sprayed 
with Kz. Pf. Kz. to no avail, and 
larger ones irrigated with snurg 
without the slightest results. 

“Once our whole planet like 
that looked,” the spokesman 
wailed. “Now, like this it is.” He 
gestured from the greenery on all 
sides to the sterility of the hill, 
or undulation, on which they 
stood; and he stooped to cast 
more dust on his head. 

As Doctor Goldpepper followed 
his gestures, he observed one of 
the ranch-hands coming their way, 
and indicated, by waving his hand, 
that he desired this man to come 
up. 

“ ‘Doc,’ seens you’re here,” the 
man said, coming up to him, “I 
got thishyere tush that’s been 
givin me Hell, my face is all swoll 
up, and I been livin mostly on 
beans an beer. See?” And he ob- 
truded a dusty finger into his 
mouth to indicate the offending 
canine. 

“Come to the ranch-house when 
you can, where I have my instru- 
ments, and I’ll take a look at it,” 
said Dr. Goldpepper. “Meanwhile, 



66 



GALAXY 



if you will pardon my curiosity, 
why is this particular hill so deso- 
late, compared to what I might 
call the lushness of the rest of the 
ranch?” 

The man withdrew his finger, 
sucked meditatively on the tooth 
and then said, “Why, how the land 
looks hyere, that’s how all thish- 
year land use ta look, twell we got 
in them Jim Dandy Giant Golden- 
Red Hybrids. Now, evva othuh 
bit a land hyere is green an 
growin. We keeps thishyear little 
old hill seprut just fer showin 
whut it oe’ul use ta look like; will 
it hurt much, ‘Doc?’ ” 

And in this wise was Dr. Morris 
Goldpepper reminded of the sing- 
ular and curious ability of the 
common earthworm — let alone 
the Jim Dandy Giant Golden-Red 
Hybrid earthworm — to rejuven- 
ate a piece of ground by moving 
through it, and by moving it 
through them, “Disgusting sub- 
ject,” some might say, but to 
Dental Science nothing natural is 
disgusting; thus cogitating, he re- 
turned to the ranch-house, fol- 
lowed by the Upsilon Centaurian, 
just in time to catch “Big Jimmy.” 

A MERICA’S leading worm 
rancher was loath to believe 
that the alien was from another 
planet, but, upon being assured 
and reassured that he was not, at 
any rate, from the Soviet Union, 
he professed his complete willing- 



ness to do business. After all, it 
is not every day in the week that 
one finds a customer for fifteen 
million earthworms. 

However, the term “customer” 
implies not only sale, but pur- 
chase as well. Purchase may be 
by cash, goods or service. Cash, 
it was obvious, the Upsilonians 
did not have. The only service of 
which they were possessed which 
was at all likely to be of use was 
that of teleportation (matterport- 
ing, according to another usage); 
and it was agreed that this was 
something for which the world 
was not yet prepared. Which left 
“goods.” 

The Upsilonian offered, when 
the crops of his native world 
should be restored to their former 
yield, to pay for the worms, 
pound for pound, in slith, purts, 
sneet, kutch and/or zooky. But 
on being informed by Doctor 
Morris Goldpepper (who had 
lived on these substances and 
their derivatives for months) that 
the best of them tasted like old 
library paste, Mr. Dandy de- 
clined. He also eructated. 

“Pardon me, folks,” he said, 
abashed and discomfited. “It’s a 
sort of nervous indigestion, which 
I get every now and . What in 
thee Hell are these?” 

“These” were a number of ob- 
jects in a small box offered by 
the alien Upsilonian, apparently 
the same bulk as a five-grain as-

pirin tablet, but shaped rather like 
tiny pretzels. 

“Minor medications of my 
planet, they are,” he said. “For 
ailments of stomach, colon, freest 
and grunk, good they are. Take, 
take, Worm-Raising Dandy.” 

He took, and while he was 
swallowing, Doctor Crawford 
asked, “They good for anything 
else?” 

The Upsilonian reflected. “Ar- 
thritis,” he said, after cogitating 
thoughtfully. Doctor “Clem” a- 
vowed himself an irregular victim 
to what he thought might be ar- 
thritis, in his left knee, and swal- 
lowed one of the pillular pretzels 
before his colleague could point 
out to him that this was all a 
highly non-scientific approach to 
a highly scientific problem. 

It was at this point that “Little 
Jimmy” came in and reminded his 
father that they had fifteen mil- 
lion worms to take care of and 
hence for that reason couldn’t 
stay there all day and all night, 
much as he (“Little Jimmy”) 
would personally prefer to do. 
The muffled sound of Mary Jane 
sobbing outside was audibly 
heard when he paused, reluctant- 
ly- 

His father rose. “Boy’s right,” 
he posited. “Well, I guess I’ll have 
to come back tomorrow and con- 
tinue the discussion. I sure do 
hope we can think of something. 
Bye.” And they drove off in the 



palomino Cadillac, and then Doc- 
tor Goldpepper had to treat the 
ranch-hand with the infected 
tooth. It was a root-canal job, but, 
with the able if reluctant assist- 
ance of his colleague, was suc- 
cessfully accomplished. 

Everyone retired to bed rather 
early, including the Upsilonian. 
“I believe I’ll take another one of 
those doo-hickeys,” the host ob- 
served, as he prepared to go 
upstairs. 

“Has your arthritis been bother- 
ing you?” Dr. Goldpepper in- 
quired solicitously. 

“No; but why take chances?” 
was the rejoinder. “Night, ‘Morry.’ 
Night, Mary Jane. Night, urn.” 

Mary Jane sniffled. 

T he next morning found 
Doctor Morris Goldpepper 
sipping his pink grapefruit juice 
(for which fruit Texas should 
be more famous than it is) with 
only Mary Jane for company; and 
she had nothing to say except an 
occasional semi-stifled sob. 

Before he had finished the job, 
the Dandys drove up, Mr. Dandy, 
Senior, bounding into the break- 
fast-nook (it was as big as the 
Grand Ballroom at the Hotel 
Davenport) with his red face full 
of beaming joy. “It worked!” he 
cried — a noise which produced 
the Upsilonian on the scene. “Big 
Jimmy” picked him from his feet 
and danced around the room with

him. “It worked! Settled my stom- 
ach like it never was settled be- 
fore! It’s just ^ot to be good for 
arthritis, too! I figure half the 
population of the C/nited States 
has got nervous stomachs, and the 
other half has arthritis! Mr. Up- 
silonian (say, are you Armenian? 
I’ve known some real fine Ar- 
menians!), I’ll take seven and a 
half million white ones, and seven 
and a half million pink ones, a 
worm for a pill. A deal?” 

The alien was too startled to do 
more than nod. 

Dr. Crawford came down at 
that moment. “Mary Jane, honey,” 
he observed, “you trot right out 
and give your sweetheart a real 
big good-morning kiss, hear? And 
tell him that the wedding is on!” 

The delighted girl rushed, 
squealing merrily, from the room, 
and her father, in a lowered tone 
of voice, winked and dug the 
other Earthmen in the ribs with 
his elbows, as he observed, “I 
found something else that those 
pills are good for! Why, good 
moTnin^, Lilybelle!” 

Doctor Goldpepper, on the 
point of asking what else, looked 
up to see who “Lilybelle” might 
be, and lo and behold, it was no 
other one but the comely house- 
keep>er, whom he had never heard 
“Clem” address other than as 
“Mrs. Doothit, ma’am,” before. 
She blushed, and her eyes, before 
she cast them down, sparkled. 



“Hmm,” observed “Big Jim- 
my,” adding, “Well I guess now 
we know what ‘freest’ means. Or 
maybe it’s ‘grunk.’ Tell them fac- 
tories to start gearing for in- 
creased production! Yip-pay!” 

“Ee-yih-hoo!” cried Doctor 
Crawford. 

The alien said nothing, ’but 
genuflected and kissed the cuffs 
of Doctor Goldpepper’s trousers. 

How Upsilon Centauri was 
saved from soil sickness and fam- 
ine, how the Jim Dandy Ethical 
Drug Company of Texas, Inc., 
moved with the speed of light into 
the ranks of the great corporations 
along with its sister-syndicate, the

Hybrid Earthworm Company; 
how James E. (for Elphonsus) 
Dandy, Jr., married Mary Jane 
Crawford at the same double cere- 
mony which united her father in

Doothit, are matters too profuse 
in content to be recorded here by 
Doctor Morris Goldpepper, now 
restored once again to health and 
duty; who, desiring only the good 
and welfare of the American 
Dental profession and the human 
race, is glad to go down to posteri-

DROOZLE 



J EAN LANNI could see that his 
girl friend, Judy Stokes, 
thought it was the lamest excuse 
she had ever heard. If your ball- 
point pen won’t write as you want 
it to, your life doesn’t stop, she 
probably was thinking. You just 
get yourself another pen — You 
don’t call off a marriage . 

Skeptically the girl with the 



long, golden red hair pointed at 
his breast pocket. “This Droozle 
I must see. And who’s that other 
member of the partnership there 
beside him? An Eversharp pencil 
named Blackie?” 

“No, that is the other end of 
Droozle. Permit me to introduce 
you.” Blandly the tall, young 
artist slid Droozle from his breast

pocket, straightened him from his 
U-shape and handed his twelve- 
inch pen to her. 

“A snake!” she shrieked. 

“What else?” 

‘Why, I thought those ruby 
eyes were jewels! I must have 
squeezed right up against him 
when I kissed you,” she cried in- 
dignantly. 



•Tfou did. I felt him squirm a 
little.” 

“Oh! And here I thought it was 
your heart beating wildly.” 

•Well, maybe it was. It does 
that sometimes.” 

“Let’s try again. And this time 
hold your snake behind you.” The 
long-legged girl stood on tiptoe to 
reach him. 



DROOZLE 



71 



“It was your heart beating wild- 
ly,” she decided a moment later. 
“Which makes me think you 
might not just be trying to get 
rid of me by a silly excuse.” 
“Believe me, I’m not,” he 
urged. “Droozle is the key to all 
my fortunes.” 

“All right, tell me about it. But 
first tell me where in the universe 
you got him.” 

“Oh, that was just after I gradu- 
ated from art school. I was on my 
grand tour. We had an unex- 
pected stopover at the Coffin 
planetary system. I discovered 
ballpoint snakes are the chief ex- 
port of Coffin Two. When we 
lifted ship, I had acquired my 
little puppy snake, Droozle.” 

“Is a puppy snake like a puppy 
dog?” she asked, fascinated. “I 
mean, do they have their little 
domestic troubles, such as the 
calls of nature?” 

“Oh, he was thoroughly pocket- 
broken before I acquired him. But 
he did like his little jokes, and I 
learned to leave him curled up in 
a circular ashtray until maturity 
sobered him.” 

44'Yf/'ELL, I should say! You 
drew sketches with him, 
didn’t you tell me?” 

He nodded. “At first he only 
had one color of ink — red — and if 
I sketched with him all day he 
would commence to look wretch- 
edly anemic. He took two days to 



refill, normally. But I could use 
him again in only one day’s time 
provided I didn’t mind the top 
three-fourths of my pen laying on 
my arm.” 

“I hope his weight didn’t get 
tiresome,” she commiserated, 
holding in her amusement. 

“I coped somehow,” he an- 
swered sturdily. ‘Xater he learned 
— after I squeezed him on the 
liver a few times just to show him 
how — to switch to a lovely 
shade of ochre, which was de- 
lightful on pale green or pink 
paper. Why, what’s the matter, 
Judy?” 

“Go on,” she choked. “Go go 
go!” 

He beamed. “I write my letters 
with him too. Every day I wrote 
with him, first in red, and then in 
ochre to give him a rest. He 
seemed to love to write more than 
to sketch. He would jump into my 
hand with tail happily pointed 
downward as I sat down to my 
writing desk. And when I later 
saw his dark green stripes turning 
pastel and knew that anemia was 
imminent, and started to lay him 
down for a earned rest, he would 
stiffen himself as if to say, ‘Oh, 
come, come! I’m good for half a 
page yet!’ ” 

“It sounds as though he was a 
willing worker, but I still can’t 
see why his malfunction makes 
our marriage impossible.” 

“I haven’t gotten to his career 



72 



GALAXY 



as a novelist yet. There lies the 
heart of the tragedy.” 

“Please proceed to the heart of 
the tragedy.” 

iiTT all began when I found him 
arched up one morning, 
writing by himself — with diffi- 
culty, it is true. His first message 
to the world was, 7 hold that the 
supine viewpoint is seldom down- 
ward! ’ ” 

“I don’t see how he could stand 
up on end to write for very long, 
even with such a magnificent phil- 
osophy to bolster him.” 

“What a terrible pun,” Jean 
groaned. “He couldn’t stand up 
very long at first. But I saw he had 
talent. I gladly learned the skill 
of holding him upright in a re- 
laxed manner so that he could ex- 
press himself on paper. In no time 
at all, he had written what was to 
be his first, sensational, best-sell- 
ing shocker, Naked Bellies in the 
Grass.’* 

“That does sound sensational.” 
“Not for snakes. He neglected 
to mention his characters were 
snakes. I Fang You Very Much 
followed swiftly afterward and 
was just as successful. Mothers 
were amused with its lispy title 
and got it for the children.” 

“Sounds like a story with some 
meat in it.” 

“Yes! Something you can get 
your teeth into. However, his next 
offering, A Snake Pit Full of Love, 



was by far the topper. It was 
banned in Boston.” 

“You haven’t mentioned any- 
thing tragic so far,” she observed. 
“In fact, you have made a pot of 
money,” 

“Right. After my snake had 
filed his income tax returns, we 
still had enough money to pur- 
chase this house and to support 
us for a couple of years. The only 
trouble is, his royalties have 
stopped coming in and that 
money is all used up. I still 
haven’t been able to sell any of 
my landscape paintings. So we 
haven’t any income, and that’s 
why you and I can’t marry for a 
long time yet — if ever!” 

Her exquisite brows wrinkled 
with concentration. “I don’t un- 
derstand. Has Droozle written 
himself out?” 

“Far from it,” answered Jean, 
seating himself and parking 
Droozle on his knee. “He’s writing 
more than ever.” 

“The quality is gone, then?” 
Jean shook his head. “No, he’s 
writing superlatively.” 

“Then what is the problem?” 
she asked, now thoroughly mysti- 
fied. 

“He’s writing classics!” burst 
out Jean in baffled irritation. “He 
won’t write anything else! Easily 
seeing the approaching catastro- 
phe, I wrote long persuading es- 
says to him. It was pathetically 
useless. Proudly he continued to 



DROOZLE 



73 



write his Rise and Fall of the 
Western Plainsman in a lucid, 
passionate prose which would 
evoke an imperishable picture — 
but in three thousand pages.” 

“I think classics are nice,” pro- 
tested Judy, “and one of these 
days I’m going to read another 
one.” 

Huskily Jean told her the 
worst. “Writing classics consumes 
paper by the ton. And if you ever 
get your 750,000 word story fin- 
ished, you must then start shrink- 
ing it back to an acceptable 
75,000 words. This is a nearly 
hopeless task. Of course if you can 
get it back to 75,000 words the 
digest magazines will have no 
trouble shrinking it to 15,000 
words or fifteen pictures, and you 
then get your fingers in the till.” 
He paused and all hope fled from 
his face. “Droozle won’t live 
nearly long enough to get all of 
that shrinking done. And in the 
meantime that scribbling snake is 
writing me out of house and 
home!” 

“Are you going to let him get 
away with it?” the girl challenged. 

DON’T know whether I am 
or not,” replied the young 
artist, looking worried. “I thought 
I had the problem solved at first. 
He got so sassy when we were 
arguing about him writing classics 
that I had no hesitation about ap- 
plying a pinch of glue to his glit- 



tering little extremity. That put 
him out of the writing business 
until he came to terms.” 

‘Well, now. You were enterpris- 
ing!” she approved. 

“It didn’t do any good though,” 
Jean grumbled despondently, 
bowing his head. 

“He wouldn’t bargain?” she 
asked incredulously. 

“He didn’t have to. He knew 
right where the cheese grater 
was.” 

“Ooh!” 

“My sentiments exactly. But I 
don’t know what to do with him 
now.” 

“You’re all out of ideas?” 

“Oh we could sell this house 
and move down to skid row where 
the rents are cheap,” he flung out 
airily, but quite plainly worried 
sick. 

“I’ve got a much better idea 
than that,” she said cheerily, get- 
ting a pad and pencil from her 
red handbag. “How about giving 
Droozle this ultimatum?” As she 
wrote, Jean read over her shoul- 
der, “‘Suggest you begin writing 
fiction pleasing both to you and 
your master, or we shall be forced 
to hand you over to the dog 
catcher!’ ” 

Jean drew back amazed. ‘Why, 
we would do no such thing!” 

“I know it, silly. I’m just negoti- 
ating.” 

“No,” he grumped, ready to be 
angry with her. He got up and 



74 



GALAXY 



strode around the studio. “The 
dog catcher! We will not lie to 
that snake!” 

Judy dropped the idea. “I’ve 
just now thought of another one. 
Here’s an ultimatum we could 
give him and mean it, too. No 
more writing until we reach an 
agreement, or we will take away 
all his writing paper and reading 
matter for good!” 

“I’d thought of doing that,” 
Jean conceded. “But isn’t that a 
monstrous way to treat a literary 
genius?” 

“Not at all!” she protested. “By 
taking on a work that will re- 
quire more time than his lifetime, 
he is defeating himself.” 

“There’s that way of looking at 
it,” agreed the artist. “All right, 
Droozle,” he called. “You heard 
us talking and you know we mean 
it. No more writing until we reach 
an agreement — or else!” 

Droozle quit writing at once. 
While the girl and the young 
artist watched anxiously, Droozle 
first wandered about uncertainly 
for a few minutes and then curled 
up on a newspaper and went to 
sleep. 

He slept all evening. 

has beaten us again,” 
Jean Lanni told Judy 
Stokes resignedly when she ar- 
rived at his studio the following 
evening. He watched Droozle fas- 
cinatedly as the snake moved his 



restless tail over the margins of 
newspapers spread on the floor. 
“He doesn’t know yet that I know. 
I discovered the fraud only by the 
merest accident.” 

“He isn’t writing?” she asked, 
perusing the newspapers for signs 
of Droozle’s elegant script. 

“He most certainly is.” 

“Where?” 

“Look at him!” Jean exclaimed, 
ignoring her question. “He’s doing 
it again!” 

Droozle had ceased wriggling 
for the moment and lay there 
shaking violently, as though he 
had malaria. Then the paroxysm 
passed and he took up his restless 
movements again. 

“The poor genius,” mourned 
Judy. “He must be sick with frus- 
tration.” 

“Sick, my eye! That snake has 
learned to centrifuge part of his 
blood while it is in his body, so 
that the hemoglobin is separated 
out. The result is — invisible ink!” 

“Why, I’ll tell that Droozle off!” 
raved Judy. “Here I sat feeling 
sorry for the little crumb!” 

Droozle did not mind. While 
she ranted, he brazenly began 
writing in visible ink once more. 

“How did you catch him at it?” 
she asked. 

“I used a piece of his news- 
paper to pick up a hot saw blade. 
The heat turned the invisible ink 
brown.” 

“Droozle,” said the girl passion- 



DROOZLE 



75 



ately, looking down at the writer, 
“you know your master is in great 
need of funds. Where is your sense 
of loyalty and self-sacrifice for 
the one who has cared for you?” 

Droozle wrote poetically, “Is 
there Joy or any other good thing 
in Abnegation? Is there Beauty in 
Sacrifice? What Handsome pur- 
p>ose do these serve a being in his 
race with Time? His Days will 
soon be spent and they will come 
no more; thus my Criterion: Is 
This the most Joy gathering, 
Awareness touching. Beauty sens- 
ing act of which he is capable? 
None other is worthy of his time!” 

“Men are not so selfish,” ob- 
jected Jean. 

“I am not a man,” wrote 
Droozle simply. 

Jean turned staunchly to the 
girl. “Judy, he has convinced me. 
I have been wrong about him. 
From now on he can write what- 
ever he likes!” 

“Good-by to our hopes then?” 

“For the present, yes” assented 
Jean stoically, as he brought fresh 
sheets of paper from his desk for 
Droozle. “My landscapes might 
begin to sell after a while,” he 
added without conviction. 

“Rotten little crumb,” Judy 
fumed, glaring balefully at the 
snake. But Droozle wrote serenely 
on, his ruby eyes glowing enig- 
matically. 

Jean interposed magnanimous- 
ly, “I see now that I have been in- 



excusably selfish with Droozle. 
I’ve kept him cooped up here, not 
wanting to bother with him while 
I was out on my painting trips. 
True, he was busy writing. But 
most of his knowledge of Earth 
has come from books; he can’t 
write classics about living things 
unless he sees living things.” 

A S she picked up his trend of 
thought, Judy’s face lost its 
resentful expression, and some- 
thing like seraphic righteousness 
spread over it. “I see what you 
mean. Just how did you plan to 
make up for this shut-in feeling 
that poor Droozle must have been 
suffering so much from for all 
these years?” 

“Oh, Judy, I’m so glad you 
asked me!” He threw wide his 
arms to the world. “Out into the 
wind and the rain we shall go, and 
there I will draw my pictures 
while he observes; then into the 
roaring, brawling taverns we shall 
go, where life thrives in all its 
abundance. I’ve been robbing him 
by shutting him up here.” 

“Jean, look at Droozle,” the girl 
exclaimed, pointing. “He has 
stopped in the middle of a page 
and is starting on a fresh one.” 

Droozle wrote, “Please not out 
into the wind and the rain. Please 
not into the roaring, brawling 
taverns where life thrives in all its 
abundance. I loathe shudder and 
tilt.” 



76 



GALAXY 



“Loathing is no reason to turn 
away from reality, Droozle,” ad- 
monished the artist. “Things are 
not nearly so bad as they used to 
be anyway. In all justice, shudder 
and tilt requires far less body- 
English than its ancestor, rock and 
roll.” 

Droozle argued carefully, “You 
will recall I heard some of it once 
when you took me into a particu- 
larly dirty bar over in the west 
end of town. I feel, as a result, that 
I have observed this type of data 
to the extent that I can write of 
it competently without further 
Study.” 

“Oh, but that was months ago,” 
enthused Jean. “The tunes have 
all changed by now. New pows 
appear on the tapes every week. 
You have missed countless sock- 
eroos already, being cooped up 
here. You will bless me, once you 
get accustomed to the realities of 
life — see if you don't. Heigh-ho 
the wind and the rain!” 

The snake shuddered. 

“Careful, you’ll centrifuge,” 
Judy warned. 

Jean added reflectively, study- 
ing the ceiling, “Day by day, 
month by month, year by year, 
the reality of everyday existence 
etches deeply into our conscious- 
ness, if we will but have the forti- 
tude to expose ourselves to it.” 

Droozle unavoidably centri- 
fuged this time, but did manage, 
with laborious lateral movements. 



to mix the hemoglobin back with 
the plasma again. 

He complained, “It is cruel of 
you to condemn me to this ugli- 
ness. I want only to read my 
books and hear a few simple 
fugues by Bach.” 

“It is not cruel. You will have 
exactly the same existence I have 
chosen for myself as an artist. It 
is fundamental that if you are to 
write serious literature, you must 
rub your nose against the realities 
of life.” 

Droozle wriggled unhappily for 
a moment. Finally he wrote, 
“Actually my writing may not be 
as serious as the title implies. Mis- 
understandings conceivably arise 
over titles. Instead of The Rise 
and Fall of the Western Plains- 
man, how about changing it to 
Those Lowdown Scaly Rustlers?^’ 

“That’s really getting down to 
earth,” cried Jean, concealing his 
elation. “But if you aren’t going 
to write serious literature, who 
will I get to go on my painting 
trips with me?” 

“Take that female of yours,” 
suggested Droozle. “If she refuses 
to go, inform her that we shall be 
forced to hand her over to the dog 
catcher.” 

“Do you suppose he means 
that?” wondered Jean. 

“Of course not, silly,” said 
Judy, bright-eyed. “He’s only ne- 
gotiating.”

Pluto has always been a 
puzzle to astronomers 
and here is one answer! 



PLUTO 



DOORWAY TO 
THE STARS 

By GEORGE PETERSON FIELD 



TpLUTO, the outermost planet 
of the solar system, was 
named after that dark, mysteri- 
ous stranger, the Greek god of 
hell. The name is apt, for this 
dark, mysterious planet has had 
the astronomers living in their 
own private purgatory ever since 
its existence was first deduced. 

The astronomers have been 



able to obtain a few facts about 
the planet, but what is frustra- 
ting them is that by using these 
hard-won facts they can easily 
prove that such a planet cannot 
exist! But, despite all their 
theories, that baleful yellowish 
speck of light continues to glare 
down the telescope at them as if 
to say, “Wrong! Guess again.” 



Copyright 1961 by George Peterson Field

GALAXY 



It all started back in the 
1820’s when it was found that 
Uranus was not following a 
smooth elliptical orbit, but was 
staggering through the sky like 
a drunk. It was finally guessed 
that the erratic behavior was due 
to another planet still further out. 
Two mathematicians tackled the 
problem and independently cal- 
culated the orbit, position and 
mass of the hypothetical planet. 
With the position in the sky 
known, it was a simple matter 
for the astronomers to find the 
new planet, Neptune, which till 
then had been overlooked. As 
soon as Neptune was discovered, 
the orbit of Uranus was recalcu- 
lated and this time the observa- 
tions fitted perfectly — almost. 
There were still small differences 
between the predicted and the 
actual positions. 

Spurred by the success of the 
previous work. Professor Perci- 
val Lowell thought that there 
might be another planet still 
further out. He calculated that it 
should be four thousand million 
miles out from the sun, moving in 
an unusually elliptic orbit with 
a period of 280 years, and it 
should have a mass six times that 
of the earth. The same figures 
were later obtained by another 
prominent astronomer, Professor 
W. H. Pickering. 

An object this large should be 
easy to find, so in 1905, Professor 



Lowell sat down at his moderate 
sized, but adequate, telescope 
and started looking. He died 
without finding it. It was there, 
but it was much fainter than it 
had a right to be and he had 
missed it. The astronomers’ pri- 
vate purgatory had started. Later 
searches with photographic plates 
also missed it, although it was 
photographed twice. Once it was 
masked by a bright star, and the 
other time the image fell on a 
flaw in the negative! 

TT wasn’t until 1930 that Pluto 
^ was found. The radius, eccen- 
tricity and period of the orbit 
were almost exactly as Lowell 
had predicted. Because the or- 
bital calculations were so closely 
verified, there was no reason to 
doubt Lowell’s prediction that 
Pluto had a mass of six times 
the earth’s mass, except that the 
size of the planet was impossibly 
small. It was so small that it still 
looked like a point through the 
telescope. It wasn’t until 1950, 
using the 200-inch Palomar tele- 
scope, that Pluto’s diameter was 
measured. It was roughly 3600 
miles, or about as big as Mercury. 
This would make the density of 
the planet hundreds of times 
greater than water! The earth is 
only 5.5 times denser than water 
and osmium, the densest known 
material, is only 22 times denser. 
Thus Pluto seems to be made of 



PLUTO-DOOR WAY TO THE STARS

collapsed matter, except such 
matter should only be stable in 
the interior of dwarf stars. Such 
a planet should not exist. 

But it does! 

The astronomers have tried 
everything in an attempt to 
make sense out of what they 
know, including fudging the num- 
bers a little. There have been 
suggestions that Pluto is a very 
smooth sphere covered by large 
methane oceans, and the small 
observed diameter may be due 
to specular reflection. (There 
was a similar effect present with 
the Echo ballon.) But there are 
slow variations in the intensity, 
indicating that Pluto is rotating 
with a day of 154 hours, and one 
would expect rather sudden 
changes in intensity from the 
specular reflections. The other 
unusual thing about Pluto is its 
orbit. The orbit is so egg-shaped 
that it actually passes inside the 
orbit of Neptune, so that they 
would at various times in the 
past and future pass very close 
to each other. The astronomers 
feel that, due to perturbations 
from the other planets, it is im- 
probable that Pluto has been in 
its present orbit for more than 
200 million years. This is only 
a small fraction of the age of the 
solar system; so apparently 
Pluto is a stranger which arrived 
in its present orbit from other 
regions of space. 



There is one other nagging 
feature and that is the breakdown 
of Bode’s Law for Neptune and 
Pluto. Bode’s Law is an empiri- 
cal formula for the orbits of the 
planets and the reason for its 
acceptance is best shown by the 
following table: 



Radius Actual 

UslDg Orbital 

Bode's Radius 

Law In A. U. 

Mercury 0.4 0.387 

Venus 0.7 0.723 

Earth 1.0 1.0 

Mars 1.6 1.524 

Asteroids 2.8 2.8 

Jupiter 5.2 5.2 

Saturn 10.0 9.54 

Uranus 19.6 19.2 

Neptune — 30.0 

Pluto 38.8 39.5 



(Note: Bode’s Law does not pre- 
dict a planet in Neptune’s orbit.) 

There is obviously something 
wrong out past Uranus. It is as 
if Pluto had come along, inter- 
acted with Neptune and pushed 
it into an inner orbit, usurping 
its proper place in Bode’s Law. 

A very weird planet indeed. 
What we actually know about 
Pluto is very little. But this little 
bit that we know points out that 
it may be very profitable to 
learn more about it. In the com- 
ing decades, as the Orbiting As- 
tronomical Observatory is put in- 
to operation and man ventures to 
the outer planets, we will get to

know it better. But until then it 
is interesting to speculate. 

/^NE of the most spectacular 
possible solutions to the 
mystery is to assume that it 
really is a visitor from outside 
the solar system. Not just a wan- 
dering frozen planet that hap- 
pened to be collected by the sun 
long ago in its wanderings 
through space, but a device, a 
“gravity catapult” made by intel- 
ligent beings and placed in orbit 
around the sun ... a “gravity cat- 
apult” being a generator of gravi- 
tational fields that is used to ac- 
celerate spaceships to velocities 
near the speed of light. 

It has only been recently rea- 
lized that such a “gravity cata- 
pult” could exist. We can de- 
scribe how it should be made, 
but we couldn’t even begin to 
construct it with our present 
technology. 

It has long been known that 
Einstein’s theory of gravity pre- 
dicts many unusual prop>erties of 
gravitation. These effects are not 
well known since they are unob- 
servable with our presently 
available instruments. So there 
was little reason to talk about 
them. The most interesting ef- 
fect is that a rotating mass, such 
as a planet, not only attracts an 
object toward it with its regular 
gravitational field, but it also 
“drags” the object around it in 



the same direction as its rotation. 
Thus a spaceship in orbit near 
the earth is helped along in its 
orbit by the earth’s rotation. In 
order to have any appreciable 
dragging effect on a space ship, 
a rotating planet has to be very 
heavy, and rotating rapidly; also 
the spaceship should be as close 
as possible to the planet’s center. 
This calls for planets with high 
density, since they have all their 
mass concentrated in a small 
radius and the spaceship can get 
close to the center without hitting 
the surface. 

Using these ideas of Einstein, 
we can envision how such a 
gravitational catapult could be 
made. It would require a large, 
very dense body with a mass 
larger than the earth, made of 
collapsed matter many times 
heavier than water. It would 
have to be whirling in space like 
a gigantic, fat smoke ring, con- 
stantly turning from inside out. 

The forces it would exert on a 
nearby object, such as a space- 
ship, would tend to drag the ship 
around to one side, where it 
would be pulled right through 
the center of the ring under ter- 
rific acceleration and expelled 
from the other side. If the ac- 
celeration were of the order of 
1000 g’s, then after the minute 
or so that it would take to pass 
through, the velocity of the ship 
on the other side would be near 



PLUTO-DOORWAY TO THE STARS

that of light. The amazing thing 
is that because these are gravita- 
tional forces, a person in the 
space ship would feel nothing. He 
would actually be in free fall all 
the time! This is because gravita- 
tional forces act independently 
on each atom of the body at the 
same time and give each atom 
the same acceleration. Because 
there are no differences in motion 
of different parts of the body, 
there is no feeling of weight. 

A network of these devices in 
orbit around interesting stars 
would allow an advanced race to 
have an energetically economical 
method of space travel. Because, 
even though the ring would whirl 
a little slower after the spaceship 
had taken away some of its 
energy, it would gain that energy 
back when it decelerated an in- 
coming ship. There, of course, 
would be no way to aim such a 



massive object, so to make sure 
that it can be used for more 
than one direction, it would be 
set to cartwheeling slowly (say 
with a 154 hour period?) so as 
to cover all parts of the sky. 

Such a device could even be 
made elsewhere by some un- 
imaginable technology and shot 
through space by a much larger 
device. It could halt itself by 
pushing against a massive planet 
(such as Neptune?). 

Maybe when we get to Pluto, 
we will find a small artificial 
satellite around it. Inside will be 
a message from the Galactic Fed- 
eration welcoming us to its mem- 
bership now that we had inter- 
planetary flight, and presenting 
us with the gravity catapult for 
our use until we know enough to 
make one ourselves — a sort of 
“coming out” present!

To spread Mankind to the stars

By KRIS NEVILLE 



Illustrated by GIUNTA 



lYlIRACASTLE: The initial 

landing had been made on a 
flat plateau among steep, fore- 
boding mountains which seemed 
to float through briefly cleared 
air. In the distance a sharp rock 
formation stood revealed like an 
etching: a castle of iron-gray 
stone whose form had been carv- 



ed by alien winds and eroded by 
acid tears from acid clouds. 

Far above was a halo where 
the sun should be. The sun was 
an orange star only slightly larg- 
er than Sol and as near to Mira- 
castle as Sol to Earth. The or- 
ange rays splintered against the 
fog and gloom was perpetually

upon the dark face of existence. 

This was the first two-stage 
planet man had ever attempted 
to colonize. Miracastle was so far 
from Earth that the long ships 
were destroyed twice to reach it. 

technicians came, com- 
manded by General Max 
Shorter, sixty-three years old. 
Men wearing the circle whose 
diameter was etched in ruby steel 
enclosing a background of gleam- 
ing ebon — the emblem was a 
silver D over a sunburst of ham- 
mered gold. 

The surface of Miracastle roil- 
ed with unfamiliar storms and 
tornados and hurricanes. Before 
these, the films of lichen evapora- 
ted into dust, and the sparse and 
stunted vegetation with ochre fo- 
liage turned sear and was pow- 
dered by the fury in the air. 

Earth equipment, alien to the 
orange sun, hammered into the 
heart of Miracastle. Night and 
day it converted the pulverized 
substance of the planet in the 
white-hot core of its atomic fur- 
naces. 

Acid rivers snapped at the 
wind and changed to salt depos- 
its and super-heated steam. In 
the gaseous atmosphere, neutral 
crystals formed and fell like pow- 
dered rain. Miracastle heated 
and cooled and shivered with the 
virus of man-made chemical re- 
actions, and the storms screamed 



and tore at the age-old moun- 
tains. 

Inside the eternal, self-renew- 
ing Richardson domes, the tech- 
nicians worked and waited and 
superintended the computers 
which controlled the processes 
raging beyond them. 

The long ship lifted steadily 
and majestically through the bat- 
tering storm and the driving rain 
of dust and crystals. Out beyond 
the dense space that surrounds 
all stars, the long ship probed the 
ever-shifting currents in the four- 
dimensional universe. The long 
ship found a low-density flaw, 
where space could hardly be said 
to exist at all. The long ship, de- 
scribed mathematically, was half 
as long as the continuum — the 
length being inversely propor- 
tional and related only to mass. 
Time was but a moth’s wing be- 
tween twin cliffs of eternity. 

Inside Miracastle’s orange sun, 
at its very core, an atom of hy- 
drogen was destroyed complete- 
ly; and in the inconceivable dis- 
tance, an atom of hydrogen 
appeared. The pulsing, steady- 
state equation of the universe 
maintained its knife-edge and in- 
evitable thermo-dynamic bal- 
ance. 

Inside the long ship, a pilot- 
machine ordered the destruction 
of a vastly greater collection of 
matter. The atoms of the ship 
and the sailors — fixed in rela- 



86 



GALAXY 



tionship, each to each — imploded 
into nothingness. 

And the long ship and the men 
aboard it were born again at a 
low-density area a million light 
years away — halfway to Earth, 
Born and were destroyed again, 
in the blink of an eye. 

Beyond the ship now lay Sol, 
pulsing in its own warmth and 
warming its children embedded 
in the cold and distant texture 
of the universe. The sailors were 
ghosts come home. 

Miracastle was alone with her 
conquerors. 

pENERAL MAX SHORTER, 
a few weeks later, began 
writing a diary. 

“I have been Destroyed thirty- 
seven times during forty years’ 
service with the long ships,” he 
wrote. He wrote with a pen, using 
a metal straight edge as a line 
rule. 

“I have served faithfully and I 
believe as well as any man the 
Corps, the planet and mankind. 
It is perhaps appropriate at this 
time, as I approach the end of 
my long service, to record a few 
observations which have occur- 
red to me during the course of it 
as well as to record the day-to- 
day details of my present com- 
mand.” 

The general wrote: “A man is 
given a job to do. And when all 
is said and done, that is the most 



important thing in his life: to do 
his job.” 

It took perhaps ten seconds for 
the soft knock to penetrate his 
concentration. He adjusted him- 
self to the moment and closed the 
diary softly. He deposited it in 
the upper right-hand drawer of 
the writing desk and locked the 
drawer. 

The knock came again. 

He arranged his tie. 

“Come in,” General Shorter 
said. 

The agitation of the man in the 
doorway was announced by the 
paleness of his face. 

“Come in, David,” General 
Shorter said, rising politely from 
the writing desk. “Be seated, 
please.” 

“General, weVe had a ... a 
very unfortunate thing happen 
on the shift.” 

The general sank back into his 
chair. Light from the desk lamp 
framed his expressionless and im- 
mobile face, half in light, half in 
shadow. He fingered the straight- 
edge on the desk top. 

“Sit down, David, and then tell 
me about it.” 

Shift-Captain Arnold moved 
uncertainly. 

“Sit down, sit down,” General 
Shorter repeated impatiently. 

Captain Arnold seated himself 
on the edge of the chair. 

“One of the men,” he said, 
“just committed suicide. He was

in charge of the air changing 
monitor this shift. He went out- 
side without a suit.” 

The general blinked as though 
to remove an irritation from his 
eye. His hand lay still and hard 
upon the straight-edge. “What 
was his name?” he asked in a 
voice that was vaguely puzzled. 

“Schuster. Sergeant Schuster, 
sir.” 

“Yes, I remember him,” the 
general said. “He came to us 
about a week before the lift. I 
think he was from Colorado. He 
had very broad shoulders. Short 
and broad. Neat appearing. Uni- 
form always in good order.” 

General Shorter ran his thumb 
and forefinger up the bridge of 
his nose and then, with a very 
small sigh, placed his palm over 
his eyes. 

“Draw up the report,” he said. 
“Was there a final message?” The 
question was uttered without hes- 
itation and was followed by a 
moment of silence. 

“No, sir.” 

General Shorter’s breath was 
audible. 

“Please feel free to smoke, 
David.” 

“Thank you, sir, I don’t smoke.” 

“No, of course not. I’d forgot- 
ten.” General Shorter half turned 
and placed his hands on the desk. 
He stood under their pressure. 
“What would you say to a 
brandy?” 



“I should return to duty, sir.” 
“A few minutes more,” the gen- 
eral said. “The brandy is good.” 
He moved into the shadow and 
sorted bottles at his tiny cup- 
board. “Here.” He held the glass 
to the light. Amber liquid flowed 
softly and the general handed 
across the half-filled glass. “Sit 
back,” he said. “I’ll join you.” 
Glass in hand, the general 
stood with his back to the light. 
He seemed surrounded by cold 
fire, and the glass sparkled as he 
lifted it. He sipped. “Try it, it’s 
good.” 

“It’s very good, sir.” 

I^OR a moment neither spoke. 

Then the general said, “This 
isn’t my first command, you 
know. I’ve seen men die. I’ve had 
to take chances with them occa- 
sionally. You could say, I sup- 
pose, that I ordered some men to 
their deaths. But still, the men 
came aboard knowing the risks. 
In the final sense, they, not I, 
made the decision. I never sent 
a — ” 

The sentence ended as the 
glass slipped and fell. “I’m sorry,” 
he said, looking down at the 
sparkling fragments at his feet. 
The dark liquid — the light gave 
it a reddish cast — puddled and 
flowed and its aroma filled the 
room. “No, no. Let it be, David. 
I’ll get it later.” 

The general went to the cup- 



88 



GALAXY 



board and poured into a new 
glass. Again he was light and 
shadow. The spilled liquid ap- 
proached the shadow and was de- 
voured in it as though it had 
never been, but still the aroma 
stood on the air. 

The general said: “Imagine, if 
you can, David, that Earth were 
attacked, and the attack de- 
stroyed many of the military in- 
stallations. After you struck back, 
David, what would you do next?” 
“I don’t know, sir. I’m not a 
strategist, I’m afraid.” 

“What about your cities? The 
millions of people trapped with- 
out supplies — over-running the 
countryside, looting, plundering 
in search of food. Carrying pesti- 
lence and disease and terror. 
What would you do, David?” 
“Well, I guess I’d try to organ- 
ize some relief organization or 
something.” 

“But David. Anything you di- 
verted to care for these people 
would limit your ability to fight 
back, wouldn’t it? They would be 
cluttering up all your transporta- 
tion, frustrating effective retalia- 
tion. Your second move would be 
to take the bombs which destroy 
people and not property and . 
use them on your own cities.” 
Captain Arnold drained his 
glass. “That would be . .” He did 
not finish. 

“Insane, David? No. Rational. 
Field Commanders must be real- 



ists. The job comes first. In this 
case, the job of defeating the en- 
emy , . But what does that have 
to do with us? Nothing, eh? 
You’re right. Sometimes I like to 
talk, and I suppose that’s one of 
my privileges. I’m not the ideal- 
ist I used to be, I guess. I remem- 
ber when I was your age. I saw 
things differently than I do now. 
What used to seem important no 
longer does. Each stage of devel- 
opment has its unique biological 
imperatives: a child, a youth, a 
mature man, look out on the 
world from a body held in focus 
to different chemistries. But the 
job remains.” General Shorter 
held up his glass. “Cheers.” He 
drained it. 

Again there was silence. 
“David, do you think I’m in 
much trouble?” 

“I’m afraid so. General. The 
Committee is due to arrive to- 
morrow.” 

“I know,” the general said. 
“This suicide isn’t going to help 
us. Tomorrow. Is it that soon? I 
thought . yes, I guess it is 
tomorrow . Well, we’ve been 
here long enough to lose our im- 
munity, so we’ll all catch colds.” 
Captain Arnold stood. “I bet- 
ter get started on my report.” 
“Poor Sergeant Schuster,” 
General Shorter said. “If any- 
one’s to blame, it must be me.” 
“He obeyed the orders.” 
“What did you say?” 



GENERAL MAX SHORTER

“I said he obeyed the orders, 
sir.” 

“Of course he obeyed the or- 
ders,” the general said. “What 
else could he have done?”

long ship hung in orbit 
•*- above Miracastle and dis- 
charged its passengers. The Scout 
Ball could handle them: saving 
energy, which along with time it- 
self, is the ultimate precious com- 
modity of the universe governed 
by the laws of entropy. 

The Scout Ball settled through 
the dark turbulence undisturbed 
by the hissing winds. It hovered 
momentarily in the invisible bea- 
con above the Richardson dome 
as if both attracted and repelled. 
It moved horizontally and set- 
tled. Suited figures on the surface 
wrestled with its flexible exit- 
tube against the storm, fighting 
to couple it to the lock of the 
Richardson dome. The exit-tube 
moved rhythmically until the 
Scout Ball inched away, drawing 
it taut. Pumps whirred. The suit- 
ed figures entered the forward 
lock of the Scout Ball. 

Inside, General Shorter divest- 
ed himself of the helmet. The suit 
hung upon him like ancient, 
wrinkled skin. 

He asked, “What time is it?” 

Upon being told, he nodded 
with satisfaction. “Seventeen 



minutes, total. Good job. Who’s 
in charge?” 

“A Mr. Tucker, sir.” 

“Tucker? Jim Tucker, by any 
chance?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

General Shorter grunted. 
“Served with him once. He’s prob- 
ably forgotten . That’s all right. 
I’ll keep the suit on.” 

“I don’t think they’re expecting 
you with the surface party. Gen- 
eral.” 

“Probably not or they’d be 
here. Earth crew?” 

“They’ve been out ten months 
or so, sir.” 

“We will have colds, then. 
Would you take me to Mr. Tuck- 
er, please?” To the other suited 
men he said, “Good, fast job.” 
General Shorter followed the 
crewman up the spiral staircase 
and along the corridor. His hand 
touched a frictionless wall. “New 
plastic?” 

“This is one of the most recent 
balls, sir.” 

“How does it handle?” 

“Quite well, sir.” 

“I miss the Model Ten,” he 
said. 

“There’s only a few left now, I 
guess.” 

“I haven’t seen one in years.” 
The crewman stopped before a 
numberless panel. He knocked 
politely. “Mr. Tucker? I have 
General Shorter here. He came 
out with the surface party.”

GALAXY 



Mr. Tucker’s voice, the edge of 
surprise partly lost through the 
partition, came: “Just a moment.” 

In silence they waited. General 
Shorter moved restlessly. Several 
minutes passed. 

The panel opened. 

lY/TR* TUCKER was a short, ro- 
tund man. His close-cropped 
hair was graying, although his 
face was unlined, with the 
smooth complexion of a child. 
His irises were gray and gold. 

General Shorter stepped for- 
ward and introduced himself. 

“Come in.” 

The panel closed. 

The two men stood. General 
Shorter glanced around for a 
chair. 

“Small quarters,” Mr. Tucker 
said. “If you like, sit there. I’ll sit 
on the bed.” 

They arranged themselves. 

“Perhaps you don’t remember 
me?” the general said. “We serv- 
ed together — what, ten years 
ago? — for about two weeks on 
Avalon, I believe it was.” 

“Yes, I thought that was the 
case. You have a good memory. 
General.” 

“Please,” the general said, “just 
call me Max.” 

Mr. Tucker considered, with- 
out committing himself. He prof- 
fered a cigar. The general de- 
clined. 

Mr. Tucker lighted the cigar 



carefully, moving the flame sev- 
eral times across the blunt end. 
He regarded the results without 
expression. “A cigar should be 
properly lit. General,” he said. 

“Yes, yes, I suppose so,” the 
general said. He paused to worry 
at a wrinkle on his suit. “Good 
trip out?” 

“Routine.” 

“New ship? I notice this is one 
of the new Balls.” 

“Mark Six.” 

“Ah, those. I’ve always liked 
the Mark Six. Solid construction. 
I’ve been Destroyed maybe half 
the time in the Mark Sixes. Each 
one of the Marks has its own per- 
sonality — I’ve always thought 
so. I don’t suppose you remember 
the old Mark Two? That was a 
long time ago. I’ve been around. 
We got lost in one once. It picked 
a pseudo-fault line and . well, 
never mind. Earth the same, I 
guess?” 

“Hasn’t changed.” 

“I don’t know when I’ll get 
back,” the general said. The state- 
ment seemed to dangle as though 
it were an unfinished question. 

“The new detectors have put 
Miracastle on the fringe of 
things.” 

“I’ve followed the work,” the 
general said. “I try to keep up. It 
involves a new concept of mass 
variation, doesn’t it?” 

“It just about makes it uneco- 
nomical to colonize a two-stage 



GENERAL MAX SHORTER 



91 



planet any more. Or to keep one 
going.” 

The general’s eyelids flickered. 
His body moved beneath the 
wrinkled folds of the surface suit. 
Cigar smoke curled in the still 
air. 

Mr. Tucker said, “You must 
have been aware that it would 
not have been a great loss to 
have evacuated Miracastle.” 

The general shuffled in silence. 
“Yes, sir, I knew the background. 
It’s part of my job to know things 
like that. You’ll find, sir, that I 
have a strong sense of responsi- 
bility. If it’s part of my job, I’ll 
know about it.” 

General Max Shorter abruptly 
stood and for a moment was mo- 
tionless, a man deformed and di- 
minished in stature by the ill-fit- 
ting surface suit. Kxpressionless, 
he looked down, without psycho- 
logical advantage, at the seated 
civilian holding the partially 
smoked cigar. 

Later the same day, Mr. 
Tucker and two of the three 
other members of the Committee 
donned surface suits and, togeth- 
er with Captain Meford, the car- 
tographer assigned to Miracastle, 
they boarded the surface scout. 

They arranged themselves in 
the uncomfortable bucket seats 
and strapped in. 

“Little early for an easy ride,” 
Mr. Tucker commented. 

“I’ve been out before,” Captain 



Meford said laconically. It was 
his usual manner. 

“How long do you think it will 
take us to get there?” 

"Between fifteen and twenty 
minutes, if I don’t hit too much 
cross wind.” 

Mr. Ryan, one of the other two 
civilians, commented, “A long 
time between cigars, eh, Jim?” 

The question was out of place 
and was ignored without hostil- 
ity. 

Mr. Ryan twisted uncomfort- 
able. At length he said, apologeti- 
cally, “Dirty, filthy business. I 
wish it were over with.” 

“So do I,” Mr. Tucker said. 

Captain Meford activated the 
ramp and eased the scout out. It 
was immediately buffeted by the 
winds. 

“Sorry,” he said. “It’ll take a 
minute. Hold tight.” The scout 
moved in three dimensions, er- 
ratically. “Wow! Let’s set it at 
about twenty-six inches. Sorry. 
This will slow us down, but it will 
ease the bumps on down draft. 
There. That’s better. We’re okay 
now, I think. I guess we can settle 
back.” 

Thirty-five minutes later, they 
came to what was left of the alien 
city. 

OACK in the Richardson dome. 
General Shorter had coffee, 
in his quarters, with the remain- 
ing man on the Committee, a Mr. 



92 



GALAXY 



Flison. They were going through 
the ritual of conversation. 

“This is the first time you’ve 
been Destroyed then, sir,” the 
general said. “My first time was 
so long ago I’ve forgotten what it 
feels like.” 

“I was uneasy in advance,” Mr. 
Flison said. “You read various 
descriptions about the physical 
sensations. Intellectually, of 
course, you draw a distinction, 
but emotionally you know that 
the only word which applies is 
death — pure and simple. But 
there’s no sensation. It happens 
too fast. You don’t even notice 
it.” 

Politely attentive, the general 
had leaned forward. “I don’t 
think it could be put better, he 
contributed. “That’s very apt. 
You don’t even notice it.” 

Mr. Flison’s eyes narrowed in 
speculation. They maintained the 
general’s own in unwavering fo- 
cus. He did not acknowledge the 
compliment. 

The general’s eyes broke to 
one side. He moved nervously as 
though physically to dismiss the 
tactical error of underestimating 
his opponent. 

“Since this is your first planet,” 
the general said, “perhaps you’d 
like to see something of the oper- 
ation? Basically, we have nine 
Richardson Domes here on Mira- 
castle. Two are the living quar- 
ters — the other similar to this. 



Right now domes Seven and 
Nine are the more important. 
They contain the air-changing 
equipment. We are holding tight- 
ly to our completion date, and 
these two — Seven and Nine — 
will be pulled out in fifteen days. 
That is to say, they will, barring 
any serious interruptions in our 
work. On schedule, I should point 
out.” 

The general poured coffee for 
himself. Mr. Flison politely de- 
clined. 

“When you’ve been in the 
Corps as long as I have,” the gen- 
eral resumed, “the schedule be- 
comes a part of you. Everything 
— ” he held his hands before him, 
fingers spread, palms facing, and 
drew them together — “converg- 
es on that. It’s that simple. Other 
planets are waiting. In a society 
as complex as ours, a million — 
and I mean this literally, sir — a 
million decisions must be re- 
viewed if the schedule falls be- 
hind. Delay of a critical item of 
equipment can necessitate an un- 
believably vast reassignment of 
personnel and supply patterns. A 
small cause reverberates through- 
out the whole fabric of the space 
technology.” 

“General Shorter, I think per- 
haps you’re being carried away a 
little. I’m sure we have adequate 
procedures to accommodate mi- 
nor variations in equipment de- 
livery dates. If we don’t, the Lord

help us: we’d have been dead 
long ago.” 

The general was in the process 
of forming an immediate reply, 
but he reconsidered. When he 
reached for the coffee, which by 
now was cool and bitter, his hand 
was trembling. 

The general licked his lips. 
“More coffee? No? Well, I didn’t 
intend to get off on this. I really 
wanted to ask if you’d like to in- 
spect our operations.” He glanced 
at his time piece. “I could show 
you the present shift operation in 
Dome Nine.” 

Mr. Flison rose. “No, General, 
I don’t want to be of any bother. 
I wouldn’t want to interfere with 
your — work.” 

Ill 

46^ITY” is not necessarily de- 

^ scriptive: perhaps less so 
than the application of Euclidean 
axioms to advanced geometry. 
Physically, it was this: 

1. Three dozen stone arches 
whose keystones were inverted 
bowls. 

2. A smooth-walled recess in 
the sheer face of a cliff. 

3. A level lip of rock, as pre- 
cisely flat as though honed, from 
which the arches seemed to grow. 

“Is this all?” Mr. Tucker asked. 

“Yes, sir,” Captain Meford said. 

Mr. Ryan came to the viewing 
section. “It looks,” he said, “as 



though the cliff were split down 
to here and then hewn away to 
leave the structures there and the 
apron.” 

“We found no tools, sir. There 
were no tools here, nor with 
them.” 

“Nothing else at all?” 

“They left behind some four 
hundred chips of stone, apparent- 
ly numbered. We have them in 
the dome. And there’s a two-line 
inscription on one of the arches. 
There’s nothing else.” 

High above the men and the 
ship, the new wind sang in one of 
the inverted bowls and fluttered 
lightly over the inscription. It, 
like the face of the cliff, was oxi- 
dizing. Dust filtered down before 
the recess, alien symbols falling. 
Life is the recording angel of 
time. Without life, all ceases. 

“Dust,” Mr. Tucker said. “Dust 
. dust . more dust. Soon the 
dust will be over everything. 
When the wind is gone, it will be 
there to hold our footprints.” 
Inside the air-conditioned 
scout, the men shivered. 

“How did you come to find 
them?” Mr. Ryan asked. 

“I saw the constructions from 
the photos, sir. This had been 
missed by the mapping party. It’s 
easy enough to see why when you 
see the pictures.” 

“This the only one?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“How can you be sure of that. 



94 



GALAXY 



Captain Meford? It’s a large 
planet.” 

“I had one of the machines 
scan the remaining maps for geo- 
metrical patterns, sir.” 

“Isn’t that done routinely?” 
Mr. Tucker asked rather sharply. 

“Yes, sir. But you see, we’ve 
always expected that if we were 
ever going to encounter intelli- 
gent life on a planet, it would be 
rather widespread. Accordingly — 
and this is the routine procedure, 
sir, used, as far as I know, by all 
contact parties — we ran through 
a statistically significant sample 
of the terrain. There was nothing 
on Miracastle out of the ordinary. 
There was the typical, low-order 
vegetable matter, about what we 
always find. It was a very typical 
planet, sir.” 

The third man from the Earth 
Committee, Mr. Wallace, seldom 
spoke. When he did, his voice was 
mild, and there was a sense of 
child-like wonder in his tone. 
“The natives?” he asked. 

“They . had fled when we 
discovered the city.” 

“Where did they flee to?” Mr. 
Wallace asked. 

i^APTAIN MEFORD glanced 
^ upward. Other eyes followed 
to end just below the edge of the 
view screen. Above stood the 
sheer face of the cliff. Clouds 
roiled below the summit, obscur- 
ing it from view. 



“There is a long sloping pla- 
teau up there, and a series of na- 
tural caves back in the next cliff 
face,” Captain Meford said. This 
did not seem adequate. He con- 
tinued: “Most of the air-changing 
activity starts in the low-lying 
areas, at first around the dome 
positions. It advances along an 
elevation front, gradually drifting 
up. Little tongues are carried up 
in advance by the heated cur- 
rents. The aliens retreated before 
it. On the plateau you can see the 
sentries. I guess they posted 
themselves there, at intervals, be- 
tween the edge and the new 
caves, to define the limits of safe- 
ty. They died there. Six of them. 
The rest, several hundred, 
reached the caves. They are 
dead, too.” 

“I see,” Mr. Wallace said. 

“When you first discovered 
them — ?” Mr. Ryan asked after 
a moment. 

Captain Meford hesitated. 

Mr. Tucker said: “I believe 
one of your men killed himself 
last night — wasn’t it? A techni- 
cian? I was told he felt you could 
reverse the air-changing equip- 
ment in time to save the aliens. 
I understand that was very much 
on his mind for the last week or 
so.” 

“I’m not too familiar with the 
man, sir. He was on Captain Arn- 
old’s shift, I believe.” 

“Captain Meford,” Mr. Ryan 



GENERAL MAX SHORTER 



95 



insisted, “when did you say you 
first discovered the aliens?” 

Captain Meford hesitated. The 
others waited. 

“They were then scaling the 
cliff, sir.” 

“And General Shorter, was he 
told of this immediately?” Mr. 
Ryan asked. 

“I don’t know when the general 
was told.” 

“You discovered them?” 

“Yes, sir. I . you see, at the 
time the winds completely pro- 
hibited air traffic. As you know, 
the air scouts are not stable 
enough until . later. Later, I . 
Yes, sir. I discovered them.” 

“Did you then inform the gen- 
eral?” 

“No, sir. I informed the duty 
officer.” 

“Did he inform the general?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Why didn’t you tell the gen- 
eral?” Mr. Tucker asked. 

“I was then in communication 
with Captain Geiger, and I felt 
he . .” The sentence trailed 
away. 

“Would tell the general?” Mr. 
Tucker prompted. “Well, did 
he?” 

“I believe he did, sir,” Captain 
Meford said. He let out a long 
breath. 

“May we see the aliens?” Mr. 
Ryan asked. 

“I wouldn’t advise it, sir,” Cap- 
tain Meford said. “High flights 



are still very risky because of 
the wind velocities.” 

A FTER the evening meal, Gen- 
eral Shorter called Captain 
Arnold aside. “Mind if I go over 
to Nine with you?” he asked. 
“The air around here is — well, 
the fact of the matter is. I’d like 
to get away from them for 
awhile.” 

“Of course not, sir,” Captain 
Arnold said. 

“We’ll call it an inspection. 
Which might be a good idea at 
that. With these people running 
around trying to interfere with 
my schedule. Poking around. Ask- 
ing questions. Taking men away 
from their work, basically.” He 
tapped his teeth with his right 
thumb in reflection. “I’d better 
check up on all the domes to- 
night, just to be sure.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“I wouldn’t want anything to 
go wrong because they’re here.” 

In the dressing quarters, they 
donned surface suits and exited 
through the locks to Miracastle. 
In the area immediately beyond 
the Dome, the solidly positioned 
connection rails radiated away. 
The general gestured for the cap- 
tain to lead. 

The wind buffeted them. In- 
side the surface suits it was quiet. 

“David?” the general asked. 

“Yes, sir?” Captain Arnold said. 
He was fastening his safety line 



96 



GALAXY 



in the keyed slot. He fumbled 
with it for a moment before the 
wind. 

“You on suit communica- 
tions?” 

“Yes, sir.” Captain Arnold 
straightened and moved forward. 
The general replaced him and 
dropped his safety line in place 
with practiced efficiency. 

Captain Arnold, surrounded by 
dust devils, became a distant, in- 
distinct bulk. His motions were 
ponderous. The general could no 
longer see his face or his expres- 
sion. 

“I do not entirely understand 
this, David,” the general said con- 
versationally. “The investigation. 
I thought I had powerful friends 
in the Corps. Though a man 
makes enemies.” The general 
lurched awkwardly over the 
broken surface of Miracastle, 
drawing the safety line taut. He 
moved toward the connection rail 
again. “A general is separated 
from much of his command. 
Some of the technical refine- 
ments are too involved — and, 
of course, men hide their feel- 
ings,” Once again he struggled 
with the wind, turning slowly at 
the end of the safety line: held 
from the devouring anger of the 
planet only by the slender um- 
bilical cord from the stars. “Gen- 
eral Grisley, now. I think he’s six- 
teen star, in headquarters. He 
was a politician. He came up fast. 



In fact, he was my adjutant a few 
years ago. He was always a man 
to hold a grudge.” 

Captain Arnold made no reply. 

“You know how politics is in 
the Corps.” 

Dome Nine rose from the 
swirling mist before them. The 
wind seemed to increase in fury. 
And still, inside the suits, there 
was the sound only of labored 
breathing and the general’s voice. 

“These natives,” the general 
said. “They were very primitive, 
David.” Neither could see the 
other’s face. “I can’t think of 
them as intelligent at all. I feel 
they were very low on the evo- 
lutionary ladder. I wouldn’t call 
it a city, as I’ve heard it called. 
Natural formation, more likely. 
Nature plays strange tricks.” 

^T'HEY were at the lock of 
Dome Nine. 

Inside, the general removed 
his helmet. “David,” he said, “I’ve 
been meaning to talk to you for 
some time now. You’ve got a 
good career in front of you in the 
Corps. You’re going to move up. 
With a few breaks, right to the 
top. I’m just now writing up my 
evaluation for your files. I plan 
to give you a very fine recom- 
mendation, Captain. Normally, I 
don’t talk about this sort of thing, 
but I thought you might like to 
know.” 

“Thank you, sir,” Captain 



GENERAL MAX SHORTER

Arnold said uneasily, opening his 
surface suit. 

“Well, let’s inspect the area, 
Captain.” 

The inspection was perfunc- 
tory. As he always did, the gen- 
eral paused at the pile monitor 
and watched, in the Dante screen, 
the virtually indescribable reac- 
tions being sustained far beneath 
the surface: molten rock flowing 
and smoking. Orange, blue and 
white flames danced as though in 
agony in the great, expanding 
cavern, danced and merged and 
vanished and reappeared in an 
ever-changing pattern. 

Back at the locks, the general 
bid Captain Arnold good-by and 
turned to leave. Then, as if an 
afterthought came forward, he 
turned back. 

“David, oh, David!” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Perhaps you remember a con- 
versation we had a few weeks 
ago? I called on you for some 
technical advice.” He held his 
helmet in his hands. 

“When was that, sir?” 

“Oh, it was about the technical 
feasibility of reversing the air- 
changing equipment, I believe. 
As you know, I can’t be up on all 
the technical, purely detailed 
procedure, for all phases of the 
operation. That’s what we have 
experts for.” The last statement 
was unusually jovial. “I believe 
you told me, David, that the 



process was too far along at that 
time. Perhaps you remember?” 

“General Shorter, when was 
that?” 

“I thought you would remem- 
ber, David. I’m sure it was you. 
Yes, I’m almost positive it was. 
But if you say . Well, David, 
it wasn’t quite so much as exactly 
a statement like that. But that 
was the general meaning of it, 
you know, stripped of all the 
technical language. You have to 
take it in the over-all context. 
That was the meaning I got.” He 
laughed tactfully. “You’re like 
lawyers, all you technicians. You 
answer everything yes and no at 
the same time. I hoped you’d re- 
member the conversation. I got 
that idea from it.” The general 
waited. “Well, David — don’t 
look like that — it’s not at all im- 
portant. Just trying to refresh my 
own memory. It’s not important, 
really . Good night, David.” He 
placed the helmet over his head. 

“Good night, General.” 

Methodically the general com- 
pleted his rounds. He laughed 
often and joked with the men 
and seemed in exceptionally good 
spirits. 

Back in his own quarters, he 
brought out his diary. With a 
weary sigh, he sat down to it. He 
glanced at his timepiece. The day 
extended backward almost be- 
yond memory but it was not yet 
late. 



98 



GALAXY 



After thumbing the diary list- 
lessly for several minutes — 
pausing now and then at a para- 
graph — he began to write. He 
put the events of the day down 
precisely in their logical se- 
quence. 

IV 

Committee took over the 
■*- dining area when the general 
left for his tour of inspection. 
While the steward’s department 
was preparing coffee for the in- 
terviewees, now assembling in 
the corridor, the four members of 
the Committee arranged them- 
selves at the larger of the tables. 
Notepaper lay before them. 

Mr. Tucker lighted a cigar and 
fingered it. “A rather good meal,” 
he said. 

The others nodded. 

“I may as well start off, while 
we’re waiting,” Mr. Wallace said. 
“I’ll summarize my somewhat 
contradictory observations. 

“Superficially, the cultural lev- 
el of the natives appeared quite 
primitive. The absence of tools 
would normally be indicative. On 
the other hand, the city was 
carved from rock in a way so as 
to suggest a very sophisticated 
technology. And writing, while 
apparently not practiced to any 
considerable extent, was known 
— or, if not writing as we under- 
stand it, some advanced decora- 



tive technique. We’ve found two 
tines of it, at least. 

“Again superficially, the city 
would suggest a nomadic tradi- 
tion, but for its craftsmanship. 
It seems independent of any ob- 
vious supply of food and their 
equivalent of water, if any. Nor 
were any provisions in evidence 
for the disposal of waste prod- 
ucts. Yet the city had the appear- 
ance of age and continual usage. 
If you notice, the floor of the re- 
cess was worn unevenly toward 
the center by what I should guess 
to be the traffic of several cen- 
turies. 

“The thought naturally occurs 
that the aliens were the rather 
decadent relics of a highly devel- 
oped technological civilization 
existing on the planet in the not 
too distant past. Yet Miracastle 
offers no evidence for the exist- 
ence of a prior technology — no 
ruins, no residual radioactivity 
from atomic operations. In short, 
the city has no apparent genesis 
in the past. 

“The alternative arises: per- 
haps the natives were not natives 
at all, but immigrants or colonists 
like ourselves. Yet the age of the 
city contradicts this. 

“Perhaps there is a simple ex- 
planation, although it does not 
occur to me. But I do have this 
feeling. The city was utilitarian. 
To me, it calls to mind one of 
those exquisite etchings of Picas- 



GENERAL MAX SHORTER

so. The severe economy of line 
suggests simplicity. Yet, on fur- 
ther inspection, you see that each 
line contributes to a rather be- 
wildering variety of perspectives. 
I strongly suspect that the city 
and the people of Miracastle will 
remain one of the great, unsolved 
mysteries of the universe.” 

Mr. Wallace was finished with 
his remarks. 

Mr. Ryan nodded. “Perhaps 
I’m deficient in sensibilities, but 
I find that the most . agonizing 
. thing of all is not ever to be 
able to know what these people 
were like. It’s almost as if some 
part of us had been lopped off, 
isn’t it? What did the people of 
Miracastle think about? What 
was their philosophy of life? 
What was their social organiza- 
tion? What was their ultimate 
goals? When you realize how 
much we learned of ourselves 
from an examination of our own 
primitive cultures, the sense of 
loss really comes home. Think 
how much more we could have 
learned of ourselves by acquiring 
the perspective of a truly alien 
culture. It’s almost as if we could 
really understand ourselves at 
last if we could only understand 
a totally alien culture . 

“Well, that’s gone,” Mr. Tucker 
said. The words were brittle and 
discrete. They hung in memory 
and the listeners waited as though 
for an echo of something shouted 



into a canyon. The echo did not 
come. 

They were silent. Grief is the 
final knowledge of time. When 
one first learns that it can never 
be turned backward upon itself 
to permit the correction of past 
sins and the rightings of wrongs 
transfixed and forever unalter- 
able. Grief is the frantic, futile 
beating of hands against a barrier 
without substance, both obscene- 
ly unreal and yet the only reality. 
Grief is the knowledge that we 
cannot step backwards before the 
death of loved ones and see those 
precious half-forgotten dream 
faces once again. Grief is the 
knowledge that time is immuta- 
ble. 

Outside the Richardson Dome, 
the wind was changing. It could 
now neither support the life that 
was nor the life that would be, 
and it howled in melancholy and 
insensate anguish its loneliness 
and longing to the eternal and 
ever-changing pattern of the 
stars. 

^HE Committee concluded 
their interviews with an old- 
line corporal. He had just short 
of thirty years service and had 
several times traveled the two- 
way escalator of non-commis- 
sioned rank from master sergeant 
to private. He was perhaps typi- 
cal of many of the older soldiers. 
His love of the Corps was ex- 



100 



GALAXY 



pressed by his loyalty to it; his 
hatred of the Corps was ex- 
pressed by his inability to abide 
by its regulations. 

“You knew Sergeant Schuster 
very well?” Mr. Tucker asked. 

“He was a new man,” the cor- 
poral said. “He got on just before 
lift-off. A week, two weeks, some- 
thing like that. I knew him, I 
guess. He was one of them kind 
that was always thinking. And 
like you know, sir, thinking ain’t 
too good for a soldier. I’ve known 
a lot of guys like that in my time. 
You know what I mean? They’re 
not cut out for the Corps.” 

“He talked to you quite a bit?” 
The corporal turned to face 
Mr. Ryan. “He was always talk- 
ing, sir. He was a regular nut. I 
thought for a while he was queer. 
He had all those crazy ideas.” 
“Like what, Corporal?” 

“Oh, like — well, you know.” 
The corporal hesitated and rum- 
maged his memory without con- 
spicuous success. “Sunsets,” he 
said rather emphatically. “Talked 
about sunsets. Talked about just 
anything. Called me out back on 
Earth to look at a sunset once, I 
remember.” 

“What did he think about kill- 
ing the natives?” Mr. Wallace 
asked. 

The question alerted the mech- 
anism which produced the al- 
most-Pavlovian loyalty response. 
“We didn’t kill no natives,” the 



corporal said. “They just died 
when we changed the air. Tough.” 

He looked at Mr. Wallace and 
then into the silence around him. 

“Well . well, let’s see. I guess 
you’d say that sort of got to him. 
I mean, you know, he thought it 
was — ” the voice became distant, 
as though describing a fantastic 
event which he could not relate 
to anything in a rational environ- 
ment — “he thought it was his 
fault. You know how some of 
these guys are. I used to have a 
platoon once, you know. And 
they say — ” He twisted his 
mouth and changed his voice to 
a childish whine. “What ior?" 
The voice reverted to normal. 
“They don’t ask for any reason. 
They just ask. I say to them, I 
say, ‘God damn it’ — excuse me, 
sir — ‘I told you to do it, ain’t 
that enough?’ Well, this Schuster, 
sir, he worried all the time. He 
got so he cut himself shaving. 
Damnedest thing. Oh, hell, may- 
be for the last week, every morn- 
ing, he came out a bloody mess. 
Patches of toilet paper all over 
his face. ‘I can’t shave,’ he’d say. 
‘My God, I can’t shave.’ He 
wasn’t nervous, either. His hands 
were okay. They didn’t shake. It’s 
just that he couldn’t shave. Like 
I say, he was a nut.” 

No one spoke for a moment, 
and the corporal twisted uncom- 
fortably. 

Then Mr. Tucker said, “Well, 



GENERAL MAX SHORTER 



101 



Corporal, tell me this, please.” 
‘‘Yes, sir.” 

“What’s your own personal im- 
pression of General Shorter?” 
“The old man?” the corporal 
asked in surprise. “He’s okay.” 
“Feel free to discuss this,” Mr. 
Flison said. ‘We’d like to know, 
really, what your opinion is.” 
“Like I say, he’s okay. He’s got 
a job to do. You know, he busted 
me once. General Shorter person- 
ally, I mean. Hell, I don’t hold it 
against him, though. He’s got his 
job to do, I got mine. I wouldn’t 
say anything against General 
Shorter, no, sir. He’s a soldier. I 
mean, you know . he’s a sol- 
dier.” 

After the corporal was dis- 
missed, Mr. Tucker said, “Well, 
gentlemen, I guess we’ve about 
wrapped it up here. I think this 
is enough. Anybody’s mind 
changed? I don’t think we need 
any more, do you?” 

Mr. Wallace sighed heavily. 
He looked down at his hands. 

i^ENERAL SHORTER was 
still at his writing desk when 
he was notified that Mr. Tucker 
would like to see him first thing 
in the morning. 

“Another day of it, eh?” the 
general asked the sergeant who 
brought the message. 

“No, sir. From the other crew, 
I hear they’re planning to leave 
tomorrow.” 



The general’s face relaxed. His 
smile reflected weary tolerance. 
“Had enough in one day, have 
they? It’s about time they let us 
get back to work.” 

After the sergeant left, the gen- 
eral wrote a final paragraph: 

“I’ve just been informed the 
‘investigation’ is completed. In 
record time, it seems. They fin- 
ished up in the mess tonight, talk- 
ing to some of the men. So what 
did it all really accomplish? They 
took a long ship that could better 
have been used somewhere else. 
Half my men are down with the 
virus. They almost cost me my 
schedule. And to what end? Just 
another piece of paper some- 
where. Put Miracastle on the 
scale against some nice, heavy 
report and see which way the 
scale tips.” 

The general closed the diary. 
It was late now. He was very 
tired. 

IVf R. TUCKER, after breakfast, 
knocked on the general’s 

door. 

“Come in,” General Shorter 
called. 

The civilian entered. The gen- 
eral dismissed the orderly with a 
nod. “And I’ll need some clean 
towels for tonight,” he called. His 
voice was hoarse. 

“Yes, sir.” 

The door closed. The two of 
them were alone. 



102 



GALAXY 



“Sit down. Excuse the cold. 
Got it last night. What do you 
say to a brandy?” 

“Don’t let me stop you.” 

“I never drink alone.” 

“Perhaps you’d better,” Mr. 
Tucker said. 

The general had paused just 
short of the cupboard. He turned 
slowly. “In that case, I’ll make an 
exception, this once.” He poured. 
“Just what did you mean by that, 
sir? Let’s get to the point.” 

“General Shorter, we’re going 
to have to ask you to come back 
with us.” 

The general bent slightly for- 
ward. His lips were partly open, 
as though he were listening to 
hear a second time. 

“Why,” he said, “I’ve too much 
work to do, sir. I’m afraid that’s 
out of the question. It’s just not 
possible at all.” 

Mr. Tucker waited. 

General Shorter poured him- 
self another brandy. His back 
was to the civilian. 

“There’s nothing more impor- 
tant, right now, than my job 
here,” he said. He drank the 
brandy in a single gulp. 

“I don’t see how it can wait. 
General,” Mr. Tucker said. 

The general’s lips were dry. He 
closed his eyes tightly for a mo- 
ment against the alcohol and the 
cold. He licked his lips. “What’s 
the formal charge?” 

Mr. Tucker bent forward. His 



voice was soft and curious, as 
though the question were his final 
effort to understand something 
that puzzled him for a long time. 
“What do you think it is. Gen- 
eral?” 

“What could it be?” the gen- 
eral said sharply. “I follow orders, 
sir. I was sent out here to make 
this planet suitable for human 
habitation. This is exactly what 
I have been doing.” His voice was 
growing progressively more 
angry and with an effort he 
curbed himself. “Put yourself in 
my position. I did what any field 
commander would have done. It 
was too late to stop it. I’ve got — 
It’s a question of the limits of 
normal prudence. A matter of in- 
terpretation, sir.” 

The general was in the process 
of pouring still another drink. 
The slender brandy glass broke 
under the force of his anger. He 
opened his palm. Blood trickled 
from between his fingers. 

The general looked up from 
the hand and fleeting annoyance 
came and went before he was re- 
called to present reality. His 
eyes met Mr. Tucker’s. 

Mr. Tucker suddenly shivered 
as if touched by a wind from be- 
yond the most distant stars, a 
wind which whispered: The 

aliens are among us. 

“General,” Mr. Tucker said, 
“the formal charge is murder.”

shouldn’t have been 
as a census taker, 
qualified. He couldn’t 
map. He didn’t know what 
was. He only grinned when 
told him that North was at 
the top. 

He knew better. 

But he did write a nice round 
hand, like a boy’s hand. He knew 
Spanish, and enough English. For 
the sector that was assigned to 
him he would not need a map. He 
knew it better than anyone else, 
certainly better than any map- 
maker. Besides, he was poor and 
needed the money. 

They instructed him and sent 
him out. Or they thought that 
they had instructed him. They 
couldn’t be sure. 

“Count everyone? All right. Fill 
in everyone? I need more papers.” 
“We will give you more if you 
need more. But there aren’t so 
many in your sector.” 

“Lots of them. Lobos, tejones, 
zorros, even people.” 

“Only the people, Manuel! Do 
not take the animals. How would 
you write up the animals? They 
have no names.” 

“Oh, yes. All have names. Might 
as well take them all.” 

“Only people, Manuel.” 
“Mulos?" 

“No.” 

“Cone;os.^” 

“No, Manuel, no. Only the 
people.” 

105 




“No trouble. Might as well take 
them all.” 

“Only people — God give me 
strength! — only people, Manuel.” 
“How about little people?” 
“Children, yes. That has been 
explained to you.” 

“Little people. Not children, lit- 
tle people.” 

“If they are people, take them.” 
“How big they have to be?” 

“It doesn’t make any difference 
how big they are. If they are 
people, take them.” 

That is where the damage was 
done. 

The official had given a snap 
judgement, and it led to disaster. 
It was not his fault. The instruc- 
tions are not clear. Nowhere in all 
the verbiage does it say how big 
they have to be to be counted as 
people. 

"IV/TANUEL took Mula and went 
to work. His sector was the 
Santa Magdalena, a scrap of bald- 
headed and desolate mountains, 
steep but not high, and so torrid 
in the afternoons that it was said 
that the old lava sometimes began 
to writhe and flow again from the 
sun’s heat alone. 

In the center valley there were 
flve thousand acres of slag and 
vitrified rock from some forgotten 
old blast that had melted the hills 
and destroyed their mantle, re- 
ducing all to a terrible flatness. 
This was called Sodom. It was 



strewn with low-lying ghosts as of 
people and objects, formed when 
the granite bubbled like water. 

Away from the dead center the 
ravines were body-deep in chap- 
arral, and the hillsides stood gray- 
green with old cactus. The stunted 
trees were lower than the giant 
bushes and yucca. 

Manuel went with Mula, a 
round easy man and a sparse 
gaunt mule. Mula was a mule, 
but there were other inhabitants 
of the Santa Magdalena of a 
genus less certain. 

Yet even about Mula there was 
an oddity in her ancestry. Her 
paternal grandfather had been a 
goat. Manuel once told Mr. Mar- 
shal about this, but Mr. Marshal 
had not accepted it. 

“She is a mule. Therefore, her 
father was a jack. Therefore his 
father was also a jack, a donkey. 
It could not be any other way.” 

Manuel often wondered about 
that, for he had raised the whole 
strain of animals, and he remem- 
bered who had been with whom. 

“A donkey! A jack! Two feet 
tall and with a beard and horns. 
I always thought that he was a 
goat.” 

Manuel and Mula stopped at 
noon on Lost Soul Creek. There 
would be no travel in the hot af- 
ternoon. But Manuel had a job to 
do, and he did it. He took the 
forms from one of the packs that 
he had unslung from Mula, and 



106 



GALAXY 



counted out nine of them. He 
wrote down all the data on nine 
people. He knew all there was to 
know about them, their nativities 
and their antecedents. He knew 
that there were only nine regular 
people in the nine hundred square 
miles of the Santa Magdalena. 

But he was systematic, so he 
checked the list over again and 
again. There seemed to be some- 
body missing. Oh, yes, himself. He 
got another form and filled out all 
the data on himself. 

Now, in one way of looking at 
it, his part in the census was fin- 
ished. If only he had looked at it 
that way, he would have saved 
worry and trouble for everyone, 
and also ten thousand lives. But 
the instructions they had given 
him were ambiguous, for all that 
they had tried to make them clear. 

So very early the next morning 
he rose and cooked beans, and 
said, “Might as well take them 
all.” 

He called Mula from the thorn 
patch where she was grazing, gave 
her salt and loaded her again. 
Then they went to take the rest 
of the census, but in fear. There 
was a clear duty to get the job 
done, but there was also a dread 
of it that his superiors did not 
understand. There was reason 
also why Mula was loaded so she 
could hardly walk with packs of 
census forms. 

Manuel prayed out loud as they 



climbed the purgatorial scarp 
above Lost Souls Creek, “ruega 
por nosotros pecadores ahora — ” 
the very gulches stood angry and 
stark in the early morning — “y en 
la bora de neustra muerte.” 

^^HREE days later an incredible 
dwarf staggered into the out- 
skirts of High Plains, Texas, fol- 
lowed by a dying wolf-sized ani- 
mal that did not look like a wolf. 

A lady called the police to save 
the pair from rock-throwing kids 
who might have killed them, and 
the two as yet unclassified things 
were taken to the station house. 

The dwarf was three foot high, 
a skeleton stretched over with 
brown-burnt leather. The other 
was an un-canine looking dog- 
sized beast, so full of burrs and 
thorns that it might have been a 
porcupine. It was a nightmare 
replica of a shrunken mule. 

The midget was mad. The ani- 
mal had more presence of mind: 
she lay down quietly and died, 
which was the best she could do, 
considering the state that she was 
in. 

“Who is census chief now?” 
asked the mad midget. “Is Mr. 
Marshal’s boy the census chief?” 

“Mr. Marshal is, yes. Who are 
you? How do you know Marshal? 
And what is that which you are 
pulling out of your pants, if they 
are pants?” 

“Census list. Names of every-

body in the Santa Magdalena. I 
had to steal it.” 

“It looks like microfilm, the 
writing is so small. And the roll 
goes on and on. There must be a 
million names here.” 

“Little bit more, little bit more. 
I get two bits a name.” 

They got Marshal there. He 
was very busy, but he came. He 
had been given a deadline by the 
mayor and the citizen’s group. He 
had to produce a population of 
ten thousand people for High 
Plains, Texas; and this was diffi> 
cult, for there weren’t that many 
people in the town. He had been 
working hard on it, though; but he 
came when the police called him, 
“You Marshal’s little boy? You 
look just like your father,” said 
the midget. 

“That voice, I should know that 
voice even if it’s cracked to pieces. 
That has to be Manuel’s voice.” 
“Sure, I’m Manuel. Just like I 
left, thirty-five years ago.” 

“You can’t be Manuel, shrunk 
three feet and two hundred 
pounds and aged a million.” 

“You look here at my census 
slip. It says I’m Manuel. And 
here are nine more of the regular 
people, and one million of the 
little people. I couldn’t get them 
on the right forms, though. I had 
to steal their list.” 

“You can’t be Manuel,” said 
Marshal. 

“He can’t be Manuel,” said the 



big p>olicemen and the little 
policeman. 

“Maybe not, then,” the dwarf 
conceded. “I thought I was, but I 
wasn’t sure. Who am I then? Let’s 
look at the other papers and see 
which one I am.” 

“No, you can’t be any of them 
either, Manuel. And you surely 
can’t be Manuel,” 

“Give him a name anyhow and 
get him counted. We got to get to 
that ten thousand mark.” 

“Tell us what happened, Manu- 
el — if you are. Which you aren’t. 
But tell us.” 

“After I counted the regular 
people I went to count the little 
people. I took a spade and spaded 
off the top of their town to get in. 
But they put an encanto on me, 
and made me and Mula run a 
treadmill for thirty-five years.” 
“Where was this?” 

“At the little people town, Nu- 
evo Danae, But after thirty-five 
years the encanto wore off and 
Mula and I stole the list of names 
and ran away.” 

“But where did you really get 
this list of so many names written 
so small?” 

“Suffering saddle sores. Mar- 
shal, don’t ask the little bug so 
many questions. You got a mil- 
lion names in your hand. Certify 
them! Send them in! There’s 
enough of us here right now. We 
declare that place annexed forth- 
with. This will make High Plains 



108 



GALAXY 



the biggest town in the whole 
state of Texas.” 

CO Marshal certified them and 
^ sent them into Washington. 
This gave High Plains the largest 
percentage increase of any city in 
the nation, but it was challenged. 
There were some soreheads in 
Houston who said that it wasn’t 
possible. They said High Plains 
had nowhere near that many 
people and there must have been 
a miscount. 

And in the days that the argu- 
ment was going on, they cleaned 
up and fed Manuel, if it were he, 
and tried to get from him a cogent 
story. 

“How do you know it was 
thirty-five years you were on the 
treadmill, Manuel?” 

“Well, it seemed like thirty-five 
years.” 

“It could have only been about 
three days.” 

“Then how come I'm so old?” 

“We don’t know that, Manuel, 
we sure don’t know that. How 
big were these people?” 

“Who knows? A finger long, 
maybe two?” 

“And what is their town?” 

“It is an old prairie-dog town 
that they fixed up. You have to 
dig down with a spade to get to 
the streets.” 

“Maybe they were really all 
prairie dogs, Manuel. Maybe the 
heat got you and you only 



dreamed that they were little 
people.” 

“Prairie dogs can’t write as 
good as on that list. Prairie dogs 
can’t write hardly at all.” 

“That’s true. The list is hard to 
explain. And such odd names on 
it too.” 

“Where is Mula? I don’t see 
Mula since I came back.” 

“Mula just lay down and died, 
Manuel.” 

“Gave me the slip. Why didn’t 
I think of that? Well, I’ll do it 
too. I’m too worn out for anything 
else.” 

“Before you do, Manuel, just a 
couple of last questions.” 

“Make them real fast then. I’m 
on my way.” 

“Did you know these little 
people were there before?” 

“Oh, sure. There a long time.” 

“Did anybody else ever see 
them?” 

“Oh, sure. Everybody in the 
Santa Magdalena see them. Eight, 
nine people see them.” 

“And Manuel, how do we get to 
the place? Can you show us on 
a map?” 

Manuel made a grimace, and 
died quietly as Mula had done. 
He didn’t understand those maps 
at all, and took the easy way out. 

They buried him, not knowing 
for sure whether he was Manuel 
come back, or what he was. 

There wasn’t much of him to 
bury.

TT was the same night, very late 
and after he had been asleep, 
that Marshal was awakened by 
the ring of an authoritative voice. 
He was being harangued by a 
four-inch tall man on his bedside 
table, a man of dominating pre- 
sence and acid voice. 

“Come out of that cot, you 
clown! Give me your name and 
station!” 

“I’m Marshal, and I suspect 
that you are a late pig sandwich, 
or caused by one. I shouldn’t eat 
so late.” 

“Say ‘sir’ when you reply to me. 
I am no pig sandwich and I do 
not commonly call on fools. Get 
on your feet, you clod.” 

And wonderingly Marshal did. 

“I want the list that was stolen. 
Don’t gape! Get it!” 

“What list?” 

“Don’t stall, don’t stutter. Get 
me our tax list that was stolen. It 
isn’t words that I want from you.” 

“Listen, you cicada. I’ll take 
you and — ” 

“You will not. You will notice 
that you are paralyzed from the 
neck down. I suspect that you 
were always so from there up. 
Where is the list?” 

“S-sent it to Washington.” 

“You bug-eyed behemoth! Do 
you realize what a trip that will 
be? You grandfather of inanities, 
it will be a pleasure to destroy 
you!” 

“I don’t know what you are, or 



if you are really. I don’t believe 
that you even belong on the 
world.” 

“Not belong on the world! We 
own the world. We can show writ- 
ten title to the world. Can you?” 

“I doubt it. Where did you get 
the title?” 

“None of your business. I’d 
rather not say. Oh, well, we got it 
from a promoter of sorts. A con 
man, really. I’ll have to admit 
that we were taken, but we were 
in a spot and needed a world. He 
said that the larger bifurcates 
were too stupid to be a nuisance. 
We should have known that the 
stupider a creature, the more of a 
nuisance it is.” 

“1 had about decided the same 
thing about the smaller a crea- 
ture. We may have to fumigate 
that old mountain mess.” 

“Oh, you can’t harm us. We’re 
too powerful. But we can obliter- 
ate you in an instant.” 

“Hah!” 

“Say *Hah, sir’ when you ad- 
dress me. Do you know the place 
in the mountain that is called 
Sodom?” 

“I know the place. It was 
caused by a large meteor.” 

“It was caused by one of these.” 

What he held up was the size of 
a grain of sand. Marshal could not 
see it in detail. 

“There was another city of you 
bug-eyed beasts there,” said the 
small martinet. “You wouldn’t 



no 



GALAXY 



know about it. It’s been a few hun- 
dred years. We decided it was too 
close. Now I have decided that 
you are too close.” 

“A thing that size couldn’t crack 
a walnut.” 

“You floundering fop, it will 
blast this town flat!” 

“What will happen to you?” 
“Nothing. I don’t even blink for 
things like that.” 

“How do you trigger it off.” 
“You gaping goof, I don’t have 
time to explain that to you. I 
have to get to Washington.” 

It may be that Marshal did not 
believe himself quite awake. He 
certainly did not take the threat 
seriously enough. For the little 
man did trigger it off. 

"VT/^EN the final count was in, 
High Plains did not have the 
highest percentage gain in popu- 
lation in the nation. Actually it 
showed the sharpest decline, from 
7313 to nothing. 

They were going to make a 
forest preserve out of the place, 
except that it has no trees worthy 
of the name. Now it is proposed 
to make it the Sodom and Go- 
morrah State Park from the two 
mysterious scenes of desolation 
there, just seven miles apart. 

It is an interesting place, as 
wild a region as you will ever find, 
and is recommended for the man 
who has seen everything.

THE GLORY OF 
IPPLING 



^^HERE’S an axiom in the gal- 
axy: The more complicated 
the machine, the bigger mess it 
can make. Like the time the plan- 
etary computer for Buughabyta 
flipped its complete grain-futures 
series. The computer ordered 
only 15 acres, and Buughabytians 
had to live for a full year off the 
government’s stored surplus — 
thus pounding down the surplus, 
forcing up the price, eliminating 
the subsidy and balancing the 
Buughabytian budget for fifteen 
years — an unprecedented bit of 
nonsense that almost had per- 
manent effects. But a career econ- 
omist with an eye for flubup and 
complication managed to restore 
balanced disorder, bringing Buug- 



habyta right back to normalcy. 

Or like the time a matter-dupli- 
cator receiver misread OCH3CH3- 
OH, to turn out a magnificently 
busted blonde sphygmomanohm- 
raiser with an HOCH3OH re- 
placement, putting a strain on 
the loyalty of a billion teen-age 
girls dedicated to Doyle Oglevie 
worship. Doyle-she insisted she 
was Doyle-he, as it took quite a 
while for her hormones to over- 
come the memory of his easy, 
eyelash-flapping, tone-torturing 
microphone conquests. Put a 
strain on his wardrobe, too.

sion of operation. Take one time 
when an Ipplinger Cultural Con- 
tact Group was handed a Bos- 
wellister with V.I.P. connections 
and orders to put him to an as- 
signment — for his maturity. 

gOSWELLISTER sat patient- 
ly. He squirmed emotionally 
up and down his backbone, but 
he affected a disdainful appear- 
ance of patience in view of the 
importance of his and his poppa’s 
positions compared with the 
pawn-like minusculity of the au- 
dience’s. 

The Blond Terror strode ma- 
jestically down the aisle of the 
open air sports arena, preceded 
by twenty-four harem-darling 
dancing girls. The orchestra 
wailed an oriental sinuosity of 
woodwinds and drums, accom- 
panying the hip-twitching, nearly 
naked, sloe- (by benefit of make- 
up) eyed, black-haired beauties. 

Fifteen heavyweights, draped 
in leopard skins, had preceded 
the dancers to set up the Blond 
Terror’s tub on a polar bear rug 
in the center of the ring. A dozen 
luscious watercarriers had emp- 
tied their jars into the tub. Soap 
and towels, oils and perfumes, 
mirror and comb were arranged 
on top of a lushly ornamented box 
that stood by one of the corner 
posts. 

The Blond Terror vaulted the 
ropes and stood in the ring, pop- 



ping his muscles, waiting for his 
handmaidens to remove the five 
layers of elaborately decorated 
robes that were draped over his 
super-manly body. 

Boswellister cringed slightly 
(inwardly), speculating that the 
Blond Terror really was a 
muscled man. All that man — 
nearly seven feet tall, bronzed, 
developed, imperious, conde- 
scending to notice just slightly 
the adulations of the women in 
the packed arena. 

The Blond Terror stepped into 
the tub, carrying out his adver- 
tised boast of being the cleanest 
wrestler in the ring, a boast he 
was unable to prove with ring 
action through the exigencies of 
type-casting, for the Blond Ter- 
ror was the villain. 

The Blond Terror muscled 
down into the tub. He was scrub- 
bed, then rinsed. He stood out 
onto the white fur rug and sneer- 
ingly allowed his handmaidens to 
pat him dry and powder him 
down. They held up the large 
hand mirror and allowed him to 
view his handsomeness while his 
short-cropped, blond curls were 
carefully combed. 

“Now.” Boswellister spoke the 
order into the lapel receiver. On 
the Ipplinger starship a commun- 
ications tech slapped home a 
switch and the solido-vision circle 
settled over the Blond Terror’s 
head, a halo of solid light for a 



THE GLORY OF IPPLING 



113 



complex Ipplinger signal-reaction 
device. 

“Hail Ippling!” Boswellister 
shouted. 

Boswellister strained forward, 
clutching the seat arms. It had to 
work! His equation must be right! 
The symbol had the proper cul- 
tural connotations. It was bound 
to capture the audience, put them 
in the right mood of awe-struck 
superstitious reverence, make the 
revelation of the great circle of 
the Ipplinger starship overhead a 
thing of wonderment and devo- 
tion-focus. 

The Blond Terror should now 
look upwards, guide the eyes of 
the audience, bring them to the 
recognition. After all, as a Bos- 
wellister . and according to his 
great grandfather, and his poppa 
too . 

But the Blond Terror gazed 
appreciatively into the mirror, 
smiling slyly at the audience. 

The crowd roared its applause 
for the trick lighting effect. You 
could depend on the Blond Ter- 
ror. No matter how many times 
you’d seen his act, he always man- 
aged to come up with something 
new. Now, for the opening of the 
new Million Dollar Ventura Bou- 
levard Open Air Sports Arena, the 
Blond Terror had done it again. 

Boswellister shouted. He 
pointed. He stared upwards, try- 
ing to draw the crowd with his 
vehemence. But he couldn’t cap- 



ture one gaze, no matter what he 
did. 

He poked the man seated next 
to him, but the surly fool snarled, 
“Shuddup! The Hatchet Man’s 
goin’ into his act!” 

g OSWELLISTER moaned. 

There it was, sailing in the 
night sky, illuminated with soft 
etherealness to give the proper 
effect to these superstition-ridden 
people. All they had to do was 
glance up and accord to Ippling 
the superiority that was Ippling’s, 
and they would be brought 
gently, delicately into galactic 
contact, opening out their narrow 
ways into the broad ways of the 
galactic universal worlds. With 
Boswellister to lead them. 

But he couldn’t make the play. 
Not a head would tilt up. The 
TV cameras that should be scan- 
ning the great lighted circle of the 
Ipplinger starship had swung to 
the entrance, waiting for the Hat- 
chet Man. 

And here he came, down the 
aisle like a bolt of Chinese light- 
ning. He vaulted the ropes, 
leaped to the tub, overturned it 
and was gone back up the aisle 
before the Blond Terror could re- 
taliate. Bath water sopped the 
piles of robes and made a mess 
out of the bearskin rug; but the 
ring attendants carted everything 
off, removed the waterproof can- 
vas from the ring mat and pre- 



114 



GALAXY 



pared to get the match underway. 

The Blond Terror paced in his 
corner, waving his hand mirror, 
challenging the Hatchet Man to 
quick, bloody death. And every 
few moments he’d stop to gaze 
admiringly into the mirror, run- 
ning his hand along the edge of 
the solid band of light, grabbing 
all the credit for Ipplinger elec- 
tronic science. He turned on cue 
to give the TV audience a full- 
face closeup. 

Boswellister cursed himself for 
choosing the Blond Terror. That 
cynical, egocentric muscle artist 
was too pleased with himself to 
have any room in his thoughts for 
proper superstitious awe, and too 
stupid to recognize the superior 
science in back of the halo device. 

“Remove the device,” Boswel- 
lister ordered. There was no point 
in allowing it to stay, and that 
band of solid light, immovably in 
place on the wrestler’s head, made 
a perfect battering ram for head- 
butting mayhem. 

Boswellister paid no attention 
to the gladiators-at-mat; he left 
his seat as soon as the device was 
removed and walked out onto 
Ventura Boulevard. He went 
over his cultural equation, trying 
to find the flaw. 

In the year he had spent on 
the preliminary survey, he had 
assessed this cultural equation to 
the last decimal point of surety. 
He had absolute faith in these 



people’s superstitions. He knew 
what to expect; but somewhere 
the equation had been off. He 
should have chosen a quieter 
event, he guessed. The audience 
had been too well schooled in the 
acceptance of the spectacular. 

What was needed was a more 
acute contrast, and suddenly he 
had it: the burlesque runway. He 
had watched it many times . 
and there was one girl, a big- 
bodied, blonde with mild eyes. 

He checked his watch and hur- 
ried his pace. It was about time 
for Dodie’s turn on the runway 
that extended out from the front 
of the gambling house. 

With satisfaction, Boswellister 
called up the memory of Dodie’s 
peel act. This would be a natural, 
and he couldn’t think why he 
hadn’t decided on it right away. 

TN many ways Dodie was a big 
girl. In clothes she could 
never be the fashion ideal, but she 
certainly made a good thing out 
of nakedness. Her soft, heavy, 
white breasts made old men 
blanch and young men start to 
grab. She was tall, with a narrow 
waist, flaring hips, long curvy legs 
and arms; with those big, inno- 
cent blue eyes, wearing high 
heels and an ounce of flimsy, up 
there on the burlesque runway . 
mmm . Boswellister groaned. 

She wouldn’t date Boswellister 
a second time no matter what he

promised, and his promises had 
included many things she’d never 
before heard of. Boswellister 
squirmed momentarily. 

It was too bad there wasn’t a 
better crowd. Most of the Boule- 
vard’s regulars were at the Arena 
opening, but there were a few 
loiterers, standing along the curb, 
watching the free show. And all 
he had to do was make a begin- 
ning, Boswellister felt. He was 
sure that everything would roll by 
itself after that. He had faith in 
his superstition equation. 

Dodie peeled. She seemed 
headed for complete nakedness at 
any moment, but to Boswellister’s 
surprise, the revealing costume 
contained more pieces than he 
had remembered. 

“Any moment now,” he whis- 
pered to the solido-tech. “Now, 
wait . there . that should be 
the last piece. Settle the device 
around her head,” he ordered. 
Then he groaned and counter- 
manded the order. He had re- 
membered Dodie’s details, not 
her act. For at the last moment 
she slipped to the wings, drop- 
ping the last swatch of lace to 
slide down one long, white, out- 
thrust leg. 

Oh, blessed Ippling! There was 
his ship, floating majestically 
overhead, but no one would give 
it a glance. He pointed to it. 
These men must follow his ex- 
cited gestures and look up; but 



they were busy calling sugges- 
tions to the line of ponies who had 
taken over the runway. Boswellis- 
ter felt as if he were standing in a 
desert, surrounded by a mob of 
phantoms from his own imagina- 
tion. 

The crying voice of the gam- 
bling-house barker rode in over 
the clang and brass of jazzy music, 
but he couldn’t turn the tip. As 
soon as the line-girls left the over- 
the-sidewalk runway, the idlers 
moved on down the street to take 
in the next spot’s free outdoor lure 
show. 

Boswellister leaned against the 
wall and watched the barker wipe 
his sweat-soaked forehead. He 
felt kinship with the man in his 
failure. The manager came out 
and talked to the barker for a 
moment. Boswellister overheard: 
“Dodie didn’t draw one customer. 
A buck ain’t to be made these 
days.” 

The barker replied, shaking his 
head, “They’re oversold, Marve. 
The give-away is all they want.” 

Boswellister turned away and 
walked towards his motel. They 
wanted the give-away, but the 
glory of Ippling he had to give 
made no impression. He felt des- 
perate. He had to make one more 
try. 

His family position demanded 
obedience from the starship offi- 
cers and crew. He stopped for a 
moment and gave a swift com-

mand into the lapel pick-up, then 
went on to his motel room. 

next morning, full of con- 
fidence after a good break- 
fast, he headed for the inter- 
section of Laurel Canyon and 
Ventura Boulevards. There he 
would make his stand. 

The boulevard swarmed with 
women shoppers. Cars and trucks 
roared by. The spectacular signs 
and free lure show runways were 
closed down, for ballyhoo of a 
different character had taken 
their place for the daytime. 

Boswellister stopped for a 
moment to watch a demonstrator 
work before a huge, block-long, 
glittering drugstore. 

The demonstrator went into 
his pitch: 

“ — money back. Now watch! 
Into a wet glass I pour a small 
amount of medically tested Cal- 
sobisidine. See how the Calsobisi- 
dine clings to the sides of the 
wet glass.” 

The pitchman smiled with 
flawless teeth and the women 
smiled back at him. His shoes 
were waxed and buffed; his hair 
fell in a black curl across his high 
forehead; his gardenia dripped 
dew like the ones in the box by 
his elbow. Each bottle of Calso- 
bisidine came complete with an 
intimate smile from the pitch- 
man, a fresh gardenia pinned on 
the breast by his clever fingers 



and a trial sample bottle. Just for 
six ninety-five, plus tax. 

“In the exact same manner, 
Calsobisidine clings to the lining 
of your stomach and intestines, 
giving positive relief from burn- 
ing pain and acid indigestion.” 

This puzzled Boswellister, and 
he remarked in a voice that 
seemed overloud, “But who has 
glass insides?” 

The women giggled and turned 
away. 

The pitchman’s scowl was a 
menace; his voice bitter: “Go on, 
scram. You queered my tip.” 

Boswellister slipped away 
while the pitchman started to col- 
lect a new crowd. He popped into 
the entrance of the drugstore, and 
as always stood momentarily 
amazed by the bewildering vari- 
ety of merchandise. Gardening 
implements, paper goods, dishes 
and gHssware, whiskey, Calsobis- 
idine, a huge display of baby dolls 
that performed every human 
function but reproduction. 

Then he gasped and walked 
towards the inside demonstration. 
There, presided over by a fake 
medical man, dressed in operat- 
ing room regalia, including mask, 
rubber gloves and stethescope; 
there, right in the middle of the 
block-long drugstore, a demon- 
stration of the newest educational 
doll was taking place. The doll, 
stretched out on a miniature hos- 
pital delivery table, was being de- 



118 



GALAXY 



livered of a replica new-born in- 
fant. 

Again and again the “doctor” 
performed the delivery, alter- 
nately inserting the doll-baby into 
the doll-mamma and removing it. 

Boswellister flushed and 
walked quickly away. He had no 
doubt of the toy’s educational 
value, but nevertheless — he 
sighed deeply. 

When Boswellister reached the 
corner of Ventura and Laurel 
Canyon, he made his stand on 
the southeast corner, facing the 
hills over which the Ipplinger 
starship would come to hover 
over the intersection and be re- 
vealed by him. 

He contacted control and or- 
dered the halo focus for his head. 
He reached up and felt the circle, 
planted firmly over his brow. He 
smiled to himself and went into 
his pitch. 

iillJEOPLE of Earth,” he began 
in a quavering voice, then 
he remembered the Calsobisidine 
demonstrator, firmed up his tones 
and started again. “People of 
Earth! Listen to the message 
from the stars!” 

“Selling horoscopes,” a woman 
answered her child’s question. 

“What’s a horrorscope, mam- 
ma?” 

“A bunch of hooey,” she 
snapped in reply, scowled at Bos- 
wellister and jerked her child 



complainingly down the street be- 
hind her. 

“People of Earth!” Boswellis- 
ter stated commandingly. He 
grasped a man’s arm, saying, 
“Stand still a moment, friend, and 
hear the promise of Ippling. Glory 
beyond your imagination can be 
yours with the ascendancy of Ip- 
pling in this world of tears and 
sorrows.” 

The man jerked away. “What 
the hell, Mac!” He looked search- 
ingly at Boswellister and mut- 
tered, “Geez, a nut.” He stood 
back from Boswellister to listen, 
smilingly superior, tolerantly 
waiting to be entertained. A 
woman dragging a toddler 
stopped, then several other people 
stopped to see until Boswellister 
had about ten people standing 
around him. 

“People of Earth!” he started in 
again, but he was interrupted by 
a cackling voice from the rear. 

“Where else?” 

The small crowd laughed and 
started to move away, but Bos- 
wellister stood straight and com- 
manded them. “Listen! Wait for 
a moment and learn your glorious 
destiny. 

“Now,” he said quietly into the 
lapel pickup, and the great dough- 
nut circle of the Ipplinger star- 
ship sailed in close over the hills. 
A line of brush fire followed the 
starship. 

Boswellister held up his hands 



THE GLORY OF IPPLING 



119 



and pointed. “Behold the glory of 
Ippling that can be yours!” He 
held onto the halo, trying to get 
them to follow the symbolism. 
“Look upwards!” He screamed at 
them, but they watched the brush 
fire that swept the hill top. It was 
a goodie. It would wipe out a 
number of homes. 

He grabbed a boy by the arm 
and demanded, “Look at the Ip- 
plinger starship. Behold the glory 
of Ippling!” 

The ten-year-old sneered. 
“Yah! That’s the new 1993 Lock- 
heed X69-P37 experimental ship. 
I got a model last week.” 

“No, no, lad! The Ipplinger 
starship, come to Earth to bring 
the blessings of Ippling’s culture 
to his backwards planet. Ippling 
will save you from wars and ills, 
from poverty and hatred. Ippling 
will be your destiny. Follow me, 
Boswellister! Ippling will lead 
you to the stars! Glory for all!” 
Boswellister patted the boy on 
the head. 

“Keep your hands off me, you 
big stiff!” 

Boswellister gulped and point- 
ed upwards. “See the Ipplinger 
starship!” 

“Aah! Shuddup!” 

His mother jerked his arm in 
reproof. “How many times I’ve 
gotta tell you not to say, shuddup. 
Say, SHUT UP! S-H-U-T U-P!” 
“Aah!” the boy said in disgust. 
“Everybody knows starships are 



big rockets!” He’d said the final 
word; he had no more interest in 
Boswellister, for the fire engines 
were coming. 

^^HEY sirened down Ventura 
-*• and turned up Laurel Can- 
yon, their heavy motors, air horns 
and sirens drowning out Bos- 
wellister’s speech. Cars had piled 
up at the intersection to wait for 
the fire engines to make their 
swing, and Boswellister leaped to 
the middle of the intersection as 
soon as the trucks had turned. 

He held up his arms and went 
into his People of Earth spiel 
again. But angry, blasting horns 
cut his voice to nothing. The 
drivers pressed close in on him, 
pinpointing him in the middle of 
the intersection. Shouts and jeers 
and horns; the roaring scream of 
fire engines; people running and 
shouting; Ventura at Laurel Can- 
yon was a cacophonous mael- 
strom. 

A traffic officer screeched his 
copcycle to a halt and made his 
way to the center of the mass of 
tangled traffic. He blew his whis- 
tle and waved his arms, ordering 
Boswellister to the sidewalk, but 
Boswellister refused to move. He 
had his mission on Earth. 

Boswellister shouted over the 
piled-up noise, waving his hand 
to the sky, calling to them to fol- 
low his lead to the glory of 
Ippling.

The officer grabbed his coat 
collar and hustled him to the 
sidewalk. “You’re under arrest!” 

“You can’t arrest me!” Boswel- 
lister squirmed and jerked away. 
He shouted, “Follow me!” and ran 
north, a good part of the crowd 
after him. He shrieked an order 
into the pickup while he ran over 
the bridge towards Moorpark. 

A woman spotted the Ipplinger 
starship that followed overhead. 
“Free samples!” she screamed, 
and those who had lagged behind 
fell into a run with the crowd fol- 
lowing Boswellister. 

The northwest corner of Laurel 
Canyon and Moorpark had been 
cleared of houses for the erection 
of a new billion-dollar shopping 
center, and the ground was 
smooth and bare. Here, in the 
center of the five-acre construc- 
tion site, the Ipplinger starship 
settled to Earth. 

The Ipplinger Supreme Star- 
ship Commander was panic- 
stricken. He had to rescue Bos- 
wellister from that sample-seek- 
ing mob. If Boswellister should 
be trampled and injured! Each 
screamed demand, picked up by 
Boswellister’s lapel microphone, 
sent the Supreme Commander’s 
blood pressure up another notch, 
and the moment the ramp was 
unshipped he hit the ground. 

Officers and crewmen quickly 
lined up to pipe Boswellister 
aboard. But the crowd pushed in 



close, forcing Boswellister to the 
rear as they screamed for their 
free samples. Two bulky crew- 
men stood embattled by the en- 
trance port, strongarming the kids 
who tried to storm through the 
port and inside. 

“Space Angel’s inside!” That 
was their battle cry as they tried 
to wriggle under the legs of the 
crewmen. 

“Ya sellin’ Oatbombs?” one 
screamed in the commander’s ear, 
then reached up to snatch off a 
shoulder patch. 

Boswellister stood in the rear 
of the crowd and wrung his hands 
while the crowd clamored for 
their samples. 

“Give us the pitch, then pass 
out the stuff!” 

“Lookit that ship! Ain’t it a 
dilly! Whatcha sellin’. Wheat- 
snaps?” 

“Bring on the dames!” 

^^HEY pressed in close to the 
starship, running their hands 
over the slick metal surface. 

“Boy, what a prop! Bet it cost 
a million bucks. What ya sellin’, 
mister?” 

“Sanity!” Boswellister shouted 
from the rear. 

His men tried to hold their 
ranks, but the crowd broke the 
lines, jerking the medals off their 
chests for souvenirs. 

Boswellister was almost bab- 
bling by the time the commander 



THE GLORY OF IPPLING

and his men battled their way to 
him. 

“You saw it all! You know!” 
Boswellister protested. “That 
Blond Terror and his harem darl- 
ings, and those violence-avid 
ruffians in the audience! Dodie, 
the stripper, with her lip-licking 
ogglers! That Calsobisidine pitch- 
man, oozing allure and implied 
invitation! My equation! My pre- 
cious equation, buried under a 
mass of pills, lotions, toys, food, 
clothes and everything sold with 
a bump and grind!” 

They fought to the ship with 
him, while the crowd opposed 
each step, yelling for entertain- 
ment, for TV cameras, for sam- 
ples of anything. 

“How could I have missed it?” 
Boswellister moaned. “I should 
have sold them with sex, right 
from the beginning.” 

“What do you do, handsome? 
Sing?” A bundle-clutching house- 
wife breathed into his face, step- 
ping on the commander’s foot as 
she shoved in close to Boswellis- 
ter. 

“Take me home!” Boswellister 
beseeched the commander. 

The officers and crew, tattered, 
demedaled, bruised and com- 
pletely defeated in morale, 
formed a flying wedge and drove 
for the safety of the ship. 

The ramp retracted. The port 
closed, then opened briefly to 
eject a nosey boy, closing finally 



on the demands and the mocking 
laughter and the clangor of arriv- 
ing police cars. 

“Raise ship!” the commander 
ordered. He sopped at the blood 
from his gashed arm and said to 
his first officer, “Somebody in that 
mob used a knife to go after those 
service stripes.” 

The first shuddered. “Ugly 
brutes.” 

Boswellister leaned against the 
corridor bulkhead and sighed as 
the Ipplinger starship rose from 
the ground. How could he explain 
to his poppa? All his brothers had 
won their worlds. He would do it. 
He squared his shoulders. After 
all, he was a Boswellister. Boswel- 
lister XIV, no less. A son of Gap- 
hroldshan IX himself, the Prince 
of Ippling World LXIV, a Royal 
Prince of the Central Ippling. 

He walked resolutely to the 
control room, riding the crest of 
his refurbished dignity. 

“Put me down on that planet 
we spotted last year,” he ordered. 
“What was that star map num- 
ber?” 

“G.S.R. 285139-F. R. A. 592- 
105-R.U. 13,” his alert assistant 
astronomical officer answered, 
reading the number from a pre- 
pared memorandum. 

Boswellister hesitated. Should 
he reprimand the officer for an- 
ticipating his failure or compli- 
ment him for his efficiency? Bos- 
wellister backed water and went 



122 



GALAXY 



to his room to learn the language 
he’d need, while the officers 
pulled their own demoralized 
spirits together so they could go 
to work on the crew when the 
news broke that they weren’t go- 
ing home. 

^^HEY made a quick passage to 
their destination, and Bos- 
wellister — well rested, well fed, 
hypnotically tutored, supplied 
with communicators, a synthe- 
sizer for his food and a portable 
equation writer strapped to his 
back, and his irrepressible, daunt- 
less belief in himself in trium- 
phant operation — stepped from 
the ramp onto this newest world 
of his Princely destiny. 

“Circle in orbit,” he ordered. 
“I’ll call you when I need you.” 

Boswellister walked confi- 
dently down the road to town. 
He congratulated himself on hav- 
ing learned, also on his wise hu- 
mility in admitting the fact of his 
having learned. He smiled now at 
the naivete with which he had 
approached his first try at estab- 
lishing a realm for his Ipplinger 
Princedom rights. 

He had been so full of illusions 
that he had landed openly, had 
stepped right up and announced 
that he had come to establish his 
household and rear his own Prin- 
ces, who would, in their maturity, 
leave to win their own worlds. In 
addition to their being small- 



minded on that first world about 
his needing five wives for his 
household, they had nearly man- 
aged to commit him to a lunatic 
asylum, for he had overlooked, in 
his equation, the fact that his first 
planet, with its two suns and per- 
petual daylight, had never known 
about the stars. There had been 
no way to break through their 
wall of stupidity, and he had left, 
the planet’s sanity-police close on 
his heels. Had he used money it 
would have been a cinch, he had 
realized as soon as he was safely 
in the ship. 

That hard-earned lesson he 
had applied to his second planet, 
but there superstition meant 
more than money, though money 
had seemed on the surface to be 
the answer to everything. On that 
second planet he had made the 
error of buying his way into the 
half-political, half-religious tem- 
ple setup and had tried to bring 
the local superstitions into line 
with Ipplinger Reality Philoso- 
phy. They had lost an officer and 
three men when they rescued him 
from the temple’s torture cham- 
ber; and none too soon, for he 
had been taking quite a stretch- 
ing when his rescue had arrived. 

Applied on Earth, the super- 
stition equation had not paid off. 
He had failed to notice that they 
didn’t really believe in their reli- 
gions and superstitions, though 
they showed every indication of 



THE GLORY OF IPPLING

being extremely devout and cred- 
ulous. He should have sold Earth, 
and sold it with sex. 

Well, he had learned, all right, 
and here, on this new world, in 
this fresh start, he would show 
how well he had learned. In the 
idiom of Ventura Boulevard, he’d 
hit ’em with the whole deck, 
deuces wild. He’d give ’em sex 
and money and suF>erstition and 
to hell with fact and logic. 

These primitive worlds had to 
be brought slowly into a respect 
for logic; for Ipplinger logic, the 
only valid system of logic in the 
whole universe. 

In the hovering ship, the com- 
mander turned to the astrogator 
and said, with the bitterness of 
yesterday’s conflict with the muti- 
nous crew evident in his voice, 
“Well, our little vaporized circuit 
is off again.” He motioned to the 
image of Boswellister in the for- 
ward viewscreen. 

It was a sight that tended to 
increase the tremor in the astro- 
gator’s hands. He replied, “I only 
hope we can pull the crew 
through another pickup. Home 
and family! Do they think I want 
mine any less?” 

Boswellister marched confi- 
dently down the road. He would 
succeed, for didn’t he have the 
well oiled machinery of the whole 
Ipplinger starship crew of cul- 
tural contact specialists to back 
him up? 



VfTniLE he walked, he prac- 
** ticed the strident-voiced de- 
livery of extravagant lies he had 
learned so well and had so mag- 
nificently imitated from the Ven- 
tura Boulevard pitch artists. He 
practiced the leering insinuendo 
of the barker outside the gam- 
bling hall; he gave it the Calso- 
bisidine con come-on; he sold it 
solid, dripping with sex, twitch- 
ing with lure. 

He knew that here, finally, he 
would succeed. 

Boswellister XIV, Noble 
Prince of Ippling, smiled his con- 
fidence in his sex-money-supersti- 
tion equation as he walked 
briskly down the road to begin 
his contact with a world that had 
substituted vat-culture procrea- 
tion for sex; that had abolished 
money in favor of a complicated 
system of verbal, personal-honor 
swapping credits; that had no reli- 
gions of superstitions. A world of 
people who considered the most 
sweetly distilled essence of living 
to be the minute investigation of 
the fine points of logical dis- 
course, engaged in on the basis of 
an incredibly multiplied logic 
structure composed of thirty- 
seven separate systems of discur- 
sive regulations, the very first of 
which was based on a planetary 
absolute, the rejection and ridi- 
cule of all persuasive techniques 
and those who used them.

ARE WE GOING TO BUILD A SPACE 
STATION? 

rpHE QUESTION that has 
been asked most frequently 
of me after seminars and lectures 
during the last five months or so 
was “Are we going to build a 
space station?” Or: “Has the 
space-station project been given 
up?” or even, “Do we still need 
a space station?” 

At first I merely answered the 
question, asserting that a space 
station is still considered useful 
and that it will be built when the

time is ripe. After a while I be- 
gan to wonder why this question 
came up with such monotonous 
regularity and I began to ask 
back. 

It turned out that not every- 
body who asked that question 
had the same reasons. One would 
be motivated by the belief that 
rocket engineers had changed 
their plans and wanted to do 
everything with direct takeoff 
from Earth. Somebody else had 
swallowed the statement, made 
by some people, that “instru- 
ments are much lighter than men 
and can do things no man could 
do, like detecting X-rays.” And 
others just read a meaning into 
what might be called an absence 
of publicity; since the newspa- 
pers and magazines had talked 
about nothing but boosters, in- 
strumented satellites and Mer- 
cury capsules for more than a 
year, the space-station project 
had most likely been given up. 

Of course it isn’t so. 

If NASA, and with it news- 
papers, magazines, radio and TV, 
is talking mainly about instru- 
mented satellites and boosters 
and so forth, it is talking merely 
about the things now at hand. 
Instrumented satellites are being 
sent up at fairly regular rate. 
By December 31, 1961 there had 
been a total of 74 successful satel- 
lite shots (USA 61, USSR 13) 
and 5 shots to and past the moon 



(USA 2, USSR 3.) Orbital flights 
have been made by both sides 
and the program to make the big 
Saturn booster operational is un- 
der way. The space station is still 
a few years in the future. And 
before we can go ahead and build 
it a few other things have to be 
done first. 

rr'HERE are mainly two things 
that must be done before the 
space station project can become 
active. One is to have a large 
reliable booster, namely the Sat- 
urn. On its first test flight the 
Saturn, since all the upper stages 
were merely dummies, carried 

190.000 pounds of water ballast 
— which gives a fine indication of 
what it can lift. As now planned, 
the Saturn will be able to put 

20.000 pounds into a 300-mile 
orbit. But if the upper stages 
which are now under develop- 
ment should turn out a little bet- 
ter than expected — let’s say, if 
they turn out as well as hoped — 
that payload may turn out to be 
ten per cent higher. This will 
take care of the necessary load- 
carrying capacity. 

The second thing that must be 
done before the space station can 
be tackled is the solution of the 
so-called rendezvous problem. 
The space station, once it exists, 
cannot survive unless the rendez- 
vous problem has been solved, 
even if the whole station was car-

ried into orbit in one piece. A 
space station is, by definition, a 
manned satellite. The crew inside 
must be both relieved and sup- 
plied. Even if he had a rather 
small space station with a crew 
of only eight men in mind, these 
men must be relieved from time 
to time. Let us say that a stretch 
of duty would be six weeks; we 
need a supply ship which can 
carry four men plus supplies ev- 
ery three weeks. 



The rendezvous problem, 
which is the physical contact be- 
tween two vessels both of which 
are orbiting the earth, is going 
to be attacked during 1963. (At 
the moment of writing no date 
has been set.) But it is very like- 
ly that the Gemini capsule for 
two astronauts will play a role 
in the rendezvous problem. 

The two unfinished items — 
the big booster for carrying heavy 
loads, and the rendezvous pro-

gram, for equipping, supplying 
and maintaining the space sta> 
tion — are the reason why the 
space station isn’t much in the 
news right now. 

But that does not mean that 
nobody is thinking about it. 

In fact we are now in the 
fourth phase of the thinking 
about the space station. 

The first phase was way back 
in 1923, when Professor Her- 
mann Oberth introduced the con- 
cept into scientific literature. He 
did not describe a specific space 



station, however; he only sug- 
gested how it might be done. His 
idea ran as follows: put a very 
large rocket ship equipped with 
a “landing boat” into an orbit 
around the earth. Have the man 
who put the ship into orbit re- 
turn to the ground with his land- 
ing boat. And then add to the 
space station with successive 
flights, until it has become an or- 
bital base. 

The second phase followed five 
years later, when an Austrian re- 
tired officer, originally a captain

in the Austrian army’s Engineer 
Corps, published a book on space 
travel which was mainly devoted 
to a description of the space sta- 
tion as he conceived it. Captain 
Potocnik, who wrote under the 



pen name of Hermann Noordung, 
had a three-body space station in 
mind. There were two auxiliary 
bodies, the astronomical observa- 
tory and the power house, and 
the main one which he called the 



130 



GALAXY 



Wohnrad (Living Wheel). See 
Fig. 1. It was a circular structure 
with living quarters in its rim. 
Of course it was supposed to ro- 
tate so that the crew would be 
under pseudo-gravity (actually 
centrifugal force) and because it 
rotated the wheel was to be en- 
tered by the hub. Curved mirrors 
for catching the sun’s rays were 
to provide power. “Hermann 
Noordung” did not think of every- 
thing, and he also made a num- 
ber of mistakes, but his was the 



first design for a permanent space 
station and his main suggestions 
have been in all subsequent de- 
signs. 

One interesting fact which 
might be useful to mention is 
that some of Noordung’s con- 
cepts appeared in subsequent de- 
signs although the originators of 
these designs did not even know 
that his book existed. It just 
proves that solutions to given 
problems are bound to turn out 
to be similar.

^T^HE third phase came in 1952, 
when Collier’s Weekly decid- 
ed to devote most of one issue to 
space travel. 

The central theme of the issue 
was Wernher von Braun’s space- 
station concept. One interesting 
result of the circumstances was 
that every one of the participat- 
ing scientists was forced to think 
about things which he would nor- 
mally have postponed. The scien- 
tific conference which Collier’s 
Weekly had called at my sugges- 
tion had the primary purpose of 
producing something that the 
magazine could publish . which 
meant that many things that had 
been stated before in rather gen- 
eral terms had to be stated in 
definite terms for the purpose of 
being painted and described. I’ll 
give just two examples: Wernher 
von Braun had stated earlier 
that the space station would de- 
rive the power needed by the 
concentration of solar radiation 
“fueling” a turbo-generator. Now 
he — or rather we, the confer- 
ence — had to think of the shape 
and arrangement of the mirror so 
that Chesley Bonestell could 
paint it, and von Braun also had 
to make calculations so that the 
overall weight of the mirror and 
turbo-generator could be men- 
tioned. I had stated (as had 
everybody else) that the crew of 
the space station would be re- 
lieved at intervals; now I had to 



think about a whole housekeep- 
ing schedule, from crew replace- 
ment to garbage removal, taking 
the assumed size of the station 
and the carrying capacity of von 
Braun’s assumed cargo carriers as 
the starting point. 

The final outcome of all the 
deliberations was a ring-shaped 
station with a circular trough- 
shaped mirror for collecting solar 
radiation. In these two respects 
it resembles Noordung’s Wohn- 
rad, but the concept contained 
many things that Noordung had 
never dreamed of. There was an 
automatic stabilizing system 
which operated by pumping wa- 
ter from one sector to another 
to offset the effects of crew mem- 
bers walking around. The skin of 
the station, automatically as- 
sumed to be metal by Noordung, 
had turned into a plastic, rein- 
forced by nylon threads or stain- 
less steel wires. This made it 
possible to collapse the sections 
for transporting them into orbit 
In addition to general refinement, 
a sheet-metal “meteor bumper” 
had been added to absorb the im- 
pact of micro-meteorites. 

The fourth phase is now. 

Now big rockets no longer 
need to be assumed, they exist. 
While the date of the first experi- 
mental space station is still in the 
future it is now a near future of 
less than half a dozen years. And 
now industry is thinking about 



132 



GALAXY 



the problem. One might say that 
the thinkers are no longer people 
of a theoretical bent who point 
out what should be possible. The 
thinkers are people who hope for 
a contract. 

Of course there are several 
designs around in the United 
States and there can be little 
doubt that there are similar de- 
signs around in the Soviet Union. 
Some of the current designs vis- 
ualize a structure similar to that 
of a Zeppelin-type airship, con- 
sisting of circular girder type 
rings for the end of each section, 
spaced apart by lightweight 
metal beams. The airtight plastic 
cover is then to be draped over 
this metallic skeleton. But Good- 
year Aircraft has evolved another 
design, one which seems an echo 
of the other type of lighter-than- 
airship we once had, the blimp. 

T FEEL a rather remote per- 
sonal interest in structures of 
this type, one which needs some 
backtracking in time to explain. 
One of my earliest memories is 
seeing one of the airships built 
by Count Ferdinand von Zeppel- 
in circling over Berlin. A few 
years later I was taken out to a 
remote suburb to see an airship 
on the ground. It was one that 
also bore the name of its design- 
er: Major Parseval. Many years 
later I was one of the men who 
founded the rocket-proving 



ground in a nearby suburb of 
Berlin. 

It took me over a year to real- 
ize that the remote suburb of 
my childhood and the nearby 
suburb of my early manhood 
were one and the same, and that 
we were building our early liquid 
fuel rockets in a corner of the 
tract of fields and copses which 
had served Major Parseval. By 
that time I had also learned to 
what extremes Major Parseval 
had gone in his design. 

In a desire to produce an air- 
ship which could be loaded on a 
truck (and the trucks of that 
period were not very large) he 
had not only done without a 
skeleton, he had not only de- 
signed and built a collapsible 
gondola, he had even produced 
collapsible propellers. His pro- 
pellers were strips of cloth at- 
tached to a hub. Their ends were 
curved pieces of steel, so that the 
propeller acquired its shape by 
the centrifugal force of these 
curved steel pieces, when the en- 
gine spun the propeller. (The 
only thing Major Parseval could 
not collapse, although he prob- 
ably tried, was the engine.) 

I was reminded of all this by 
seeing that Goodyear’s space sta- 
tion is not only completely col- 
lapsible — they call it “expand- 
able” — but that even their solar 
reflectors are not rigid! 

The reason why these struc- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



133 



tures are called “expandable” in- 
stead of collapsible is that, at 
least in one version, they cannot 
be collapsed again once they 
have been expanded. The design 
works with quick-setting plastic 
foam which will be injected into 
the space between an inner and 
outer skin. Or else there may be 
hose-like “stiffeners”. 

Work on a model of this type 
is now going on. 

Indubitably there will be 
changes as experimentation pro- 
gresses. There might even be 
changes in concept in some areas 
of the design. If, for example, 
during the next two years — 
while the Saturn is proved out 
as reliable and a rendezvous tech- 
nique is being evolved — an 
atomic reactor of high energy out- 
put, light overall weight and 
proven reliability is developed, 
the time-honored solar collector 
and turbo-generator system may 
be abandoned. But only if, kilo- 
watt-hour for kilowatt-hour, the 
atomic reactor is considerably 
lighter. If it is only a little lighter 
the consideration that solar radi- 
ation comes free of charge while 
heavy isotopes cost money will 
still win out. 

The first experimental space 
station is likely to be rather 
small. But a larger one is in the 
future. 

The concept of the space sta- 
tion has not been given up. 



QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

If “perigee” means the point 
of an orbit closest to Earth and 
“perihelion” means the point of 
an orbit closest to the sun (with 
“apogee” and “aphelion” being 
their opposites) what words 
should one use for the point 
closest to another planet? 

Selma Felicitas Montez 
Regina Nubili, Argentina 

When I taught at Fairleigh 
Dickinson University in New 
Jersey I used to say that my 
best students were married wo- 
men who went to college because 
they wanted to, not because 
father said so. I’ll now amend 
this statement to say that female 
students have a talent for asking 
especially difficult questions. 

When Johannes Kepler coined 
the word perihelion, etc., he used 
the Greek name (Helios) of the 
sun, not the Latin (Sol) or the 
German (Sonne); likewise for 
Earth he used the Greek gaia 
instead of the Latin terra. Now, 
after mulling over this letter, 
and even calling on friends for 
help, I know why. If you try to 
do it with the Latin names you 
get rather clumsy constructions. 
Before I go into the problem let 
me say that “perigee” should 
really be peri-gaion, and in some 
languages this form, or one close 
to it, is used. Likewise the term 



134 



GALAXY 



peri-astron (from Greek aster 
for star) for closest approach to 
a star, for example by a comet, 
is astronomical usage. Of course 
the term is rarely used. The con- 
cept is not needed often. 

Now let’s go to work. 

If you use the Greek name for 
Mercury, Hermeias, you get a 
reasonable word for the equiva- 
lents of perigee and aprogee, 
namely peri-hermeion and apo- 
hermeion. The latter might be 
contracted to aphermeion, fol- 
lowing the example of aphe- 
lion for apo-helion. The next 
planet, Venus, is a little more of 
a problem. Using the Latin name 
Venus always works out clum- 
sily in English, partly because 
“of Venus” is veneris which is 
misleading, to say the least. But 
we have a choice of classical 
names for Venus. One of them 
is Hesperos which would produce 
peri-hesperon and apo-hesperon. 
Again the latter might be con- 
tracted into aphesperon. 

Our own moon poses a prob- 
lem which is not only linguisti- 
cally troublesome but fairly 
urgent. We’ll need these terms 
soon! The Latin name is, course, 
Luna, the Greek is Selene (three 
syllables, please!) and the better 
choice again seems to be the 
Greek, giving us peri-seleneion 
(peri-selenon) and apo-seleneion 
(apo-selenon.) Mars (Greek: 
Ares) presents no difficulties. 



The terms would be peri-areion 
(peri-areon) and apo-areion 
(apo-areon.) 

As for the outer planets the 
terms may sound somewhat 
clumsy but do not present any 
special difficulties. For Saturn 
the Latin name works out bet- 
ter, e. g. peri-satumium. Uranus 
is Greek to begin with and the 
Greek ending would be prefer- 
able since the Latin form would 
be peri-uranium which might 
cause misunderstandings. In the 
case of Neptune one could use 
this Latin form, or else go to the 
Greek equivalent Poseidon. 

The reason I left out Jupiter 
is threefold. Neither the Latin 
Jupiter nor the Greek equival- 
ent Zenus produce very elegant 
terms. Moreover, because of 
work on the orbits of Jupiter’s 
numerous moons, a term for the 
closest approach is already be- 
ing used. It is perijove, hardly 
pretty but, under the circum- 
stances, the least of three possible 
evils. 

In reality future astronauts 
will probably say “my closest 
approach was so and so many 
miles.” Or else, since on a chart 
the closest approach is always 
designated by the Greek letter 
pi, they may avoid words like 
peri-kythereion by saying that 
they are approaching the pi 
position.

spoiled child's plaything — 
now Chandler was in the very 
presence of the destroyers!

CONCLUSION 



GALAXY 




On Christmas the world's freedom died. Every man, woman and 
child lay In the grip of fear, for no one knew at what moment his 
nearest friend or a casual stranger might suddenly be possessed 
by some brutal mind . and begin to murder and destroy. For 
Chandler it was worse than for most. He was both victim and 
executioner. He had suffered himself, ond he had committed a 
violent crime while under the strange domination. Accusing of 
hoaxing he was driven from his home. He wandered until he 
found himself in Hawaii and learned that this was the center of the 
plague — and that he was helpless to do anything about it! 



VII 

A PINK and silver bus let 
Chandler off at Fort Street 
in downtown Honolulu and he 
walked a few blocks to the ad- 
dress he had been given. The 
name of the place was Parts ’n 
Plenty. He found it easily 
enough. It was a radio parts 
store; by the size of it, it had 
once been a big, well-stocked one; 
but now the counters were almost 
bare. 

A thin-faced man with khaki- 
colored skin looked up and nod- 
ded. Chandler nodded back. He 
fingered a bin of tuning knobs, 
hefted a coil of two-strand an- 
tenna wire and said, “A fellow 



at Tripler told me to come here 
to pick up equipment, but I’m 
damned if I know what I’m sup- 
posed to do when I locate it. I 
don’t have any money.” 

The dark-skinned man got up 
and came over to him. “Figured 
you for a mainlander. No sweat. 
Have you got a list?” 

“I can make one.” 

“All right. Catalogues on the 
table behind you, if you want 
them.” He offered Chandler a 
cigarette and sat against the edge 
of the counter, reading over 
Chandler’s shoulder. “Ho,” he 
said suddenly. “Koitska’s square- 
wave generator again, right?” 
Chandler admitted it, and the 
man grinned. “Every couple

months he sends somebody along. 
He doesn’t really need the gen- 
erator, you know. He just wants 
to see how much you know about 
building it, Mr. — ?” 
“Chandler.” 

“Glad to know you. I’m John 
Hsi. But don’t go easy on the job 
just because it’s a waste of time, 
Chandler; it could be pretty im- 
portant to you.” 

Chandler absorbed the infor- 
mation silently and handed over 
his list. The man did not look at 
it. “Come back in about an hour,” 
he said. 

“I won’t have any money in an 
hour, either.” 

“Oh, that’s all right. I’ll put it 
on Koitska’s bill.” 

Chandler said frankly, “Look, 
I don’t know what’s going on. 
Suppose I came in and picked up 
a thousand dollars worth of stuff, 
would you put that on the bill, 
too?” 

“Certainly,” said Hsi optim- 
istically. “You thinking about 
stealing them? What would you 
do with them?” 

“Well . Chandler puffed on 
his cigarette. “Well, I could — ” 
“No, you couldn’t. Also, it 
wouldn’t pay, believe me,” Hsi 
said seriously. “If there is one 
thing that doesn’t pay, it is cheat- 
ing on the Exec.” 

“Now, that’s another good 
question,” said Chandler. “Who 
is the Exec?” 



Hsi shook his head. “Sorry. I 
don’t know you. Chandler.” 
“You mean you’re afraid even 
to answer a question?” 

“You’re damned well told I 
am. Probably nobody would 
mind what I might tell you . 
but ‘probably’ isn’t good enough.” 
Exasperated, Chandler said, 
“How the devil am I supposed to 
know what to do next? So I take 
all this junk back to my room 
at Tripler and solder up the gen- 
erator — then what?” 

“Then Koitska will get in touch 
with you,” Hsi said, not unkindly. 
“Play it as it comes to you, 
Chandler, that’s the best advice 
I can offer.” He hesitated. “Koits- 
ka’s not the worst of them,” he 
said; and then, daringly, “and 
maybe he’s not the best, either. 
Just do whatever he told you. 
Keep on doing it until he tells 
you to do something else. That’s 
all. I mean, that’s all the advice 
I can give you. Whether it’s going 
to be enough to satisfy Koitska 
is something else again.” 

^^HERE is not much to do in a 
strange town when you have 
no money. Chandler’s room at 
what once had been Tripler Gen- 
eral Hospital was free; the bus 
was free; evidently all the radio 
parts he could want were also 
free. But he did not have the 
price of a cup of coffee or a hair- 
cut in the pockets of the suntan

slacks the desk man at Tripler 
had issued him. He wandered 
around the streets of Honolulu, 
waiting for the hour to be up. 

At Tripler a doctor had also 
examined his scar and it was now 
concealed under a neat white 
bandage; he had been fed; he 
had bathed; he had been given 
new clothes. Tripler was a teem- 
ing metropolis in itself, a main 
building some ten stories high, a 
scattering of outbuildings con- 
nected to it by covered passages, 
with thousands of men and 
women busy about it. Chandler 
had spoken to a good many of 
them in the hour after waking up 
and before boarding the bus to 
Honolulu, and none of them had 
been free with information either. 

Honolulu had not suffered 
greatly under the rule of the 
Exec. Remembering the shat- 
tered stateside cities. Chandler 
thought that this one had been 
spared nearly all the suffering of 
the rule of the world by the Exec, 
whoever they were. Dawdling 
down King Street, in the aro- 
matic reek of the fish markets, 
Chandler could have thought 
himself in any port city before 
the grisly events of that Christ- 
mas when the planet went pos- 
sessed. Crabs waved sluggishly at 
him from bins. Great pink-scaled 
fish rested on nests of ice, waiting 
to be sold. Smells of frying food 
came from half a dozen restau- 



rants. It was only the people who 
were different. There was a solid 
sprinkling of those who, like him- 
self, were dressed in insigneless 
former Army uniforms — obvi- 
ously conscripts on Exec errands 
— and a surprising minority who, 
from overheard snatches of con- 
versation, had come from coun- 
tries other than the U.S.A. Rus- 
sian mostly, Chandler guessed; 
but Russian or U.S., wearing sun- 
tans or aloha shirts, everyone he 
saw was marked by the visible 
signs of strain. There was no 
laughter. 

Chandler saw a clock within 
the door of a restaurant; half an 
hour still to kill. He turned and 
wandered up, away from the 
water, toward the visible bulk of 
the hills; and in a moment he 
saw what made Honolulu’s col- 
lective face wear its careworn 
frown. 

It was an open square — per- 
haps it had once been a war 
memorial — and in the center of 
it was a fenced-off paved area 
where people seemed to be rest- 
ing. It struck Chandler as curious 
that so many persons should have 
decided to take a nap on what 
surely was an uncomfortable bed 
of flat concrete; he approached 
and saw that they were not rest- 
ing. Not only his eyes but his 
ears conveyed the message — 
and his nose, too, for the mild air 
was fetid with blood and rot.

These were not sleeping men and 
women. Some were dead; some 
were unconscious; all were 
maimed. The pavement was 
slimed with their blood. None 
had the strength to scream, but 
several were moaning and even 
some of the unconscious ones 
gasped like the breathing of a 
man in diabetic coma. Passersby 
walked briskly around the metal 
fence, and if their glances were 
curious it was at Chandler they 
looked, not at the tortured wrecks 
before them. He understood that 
the sight of the dying men and 
women was familiar — was pain- 
ful — and thus was ignored; it 
was himself who was the curios- 
ity, for staring at them. He

TTE WAS still shaken when he 
returned to Parts ’n Plenty. 

The hour was up but Hsi 
shook his head. “Not yet. You 
can sit down over there if you 
like.” Chandler slumped into the 
indicated swivel chair and stared 
blankly at the wall. This was far 
worse than anything he had seen 
stateside. The random terror of 
murders and bombs was at least 
a momentary thing, and when it 
was done it was done. This was 
sustained torture. He buried his 
head in his hands and did not 
look up until he heard the sound 
of a door opening. 



140 



GALAXY 




Hsi, his face somehow different, 
was manipulating a lever on the 
outside of a door while a man 
inside, becoming visible as the 
door opened, was doing the same 
from within. It looked as though 
the lock on the door would not 
work unless both levers operated; 
and the man on the inside, whom 
Chandler had not seen before, 
was dressed, oddly, only in bath- 
ing trunks. His face wore the 
same expression as Hsi’s. Chand- 
ler guessed (with practice it was 
becoming easy!) that both were 
possessed. 

The man inside wheeled out 
two shopping carts loaded with 
electronic equipment of varying 
kinds, wordlessly received some 



empty ones from Hsi; and the 
door closed on him again. 

Hsi tugged the lever down, 
turned, blinked and said, “All 
right, Chandler. Your stuff’s 
here.” 

Chandler approached. “What 
was that all about?” 

“Go to hell!” Hsi said with 
sudden violence. “I — Oh never 
mind. Sorry. But I told you al- 
ready, ask somebody else your 
questions, not me.” He gloomily 
began to pack the items on 
Chandler’s list into a cardboard 
carton. Then he glanced at 
Chandlei and said, apologetically, 
“These are tough times, buddy. I 
guess there’s no harm in answer- 
ing some questions. You want to

know why most of my stock’s 
locked behind an armor-plate 
door? Well, you ought to be able 
to figure that out for yourself, 
anyway. The Exec doesn’t like to 
have people playing with radios. 
Bert stays in the stockroom; I 
stay out here; twice a day the 
bosses open the door and we fill 
whatever orders they’ve ap- 
proved. A little rough on Bert, of 
course. It’s a ten-hour day in the 
stockroom for him, and nothing 
to do. But it could be worse. Oh, 
that’s for sure, friend: It could 
be worse.” 

“Why the bathing suit? Hot in 
there?” 

“Hot for Bert if they think he’s 
smuggling stuff out,” said Hsi. 
“You been here long enough to 
see the Monument yet?” 

Chandler shook his head, then 
grimaced. “You mean up about 
three blocks that way? Where 
the people — ?” 

“That’s right,” said Hsi admir- 
ingly, “three blocks mauka from 
here, where the people — Where 
the people are serving as a very 
good object lesson to you and 
me. About a dozen there, right? 
Small for this time of year. 
Chandler. Usually there are 
more. Notice anything special 
about them?” 

“They were butchered! Some 
of them looked like their legs 
had been burned right off. Their 
eyes gouged out, their faces — ” 



Chandler brought up sharply. It 
had been bad enough looking at 
those wretched, writhing semi- 
cadavers; he did not want to talk 
about them. 

The parts man nodded serious- 
ly. “Sometimes there are more, 
and sometimes they’re worse 
hurt than that. Have you got 
any idea how they get that way? 
They do it to themselves, that’s 
how. My own brother was out 
there for a week, last Statehood 
Day. He jumped feet first into a 
concrete mixer, and it took him 
seven days to die after I put him 
on my shoulder and carried him 
out there. I didn’t like it, of 
course, but I didn’t exactly have 
any choice; 1 wasn’t running my 
own body at the time. Neither 
was he when he jumped. He was 
made to do it, because he used to 
have Bert’s job and he thought 
he’d take a little short-wave set 
home. Like I said, you don’t want 
to cheat on the Exec because it 
doesn’t pay.” 

“But what the devil am I sup- 
posed to — ” 

Hsi held up his hand. “Don’t 
ask me how to keep out of that 
Monument bunch. Chandler. I 
don’t know. Do what you’re told 
and don’t do anything you aren’t 
told to do; that is the whole of 
the law. Now do me a favor and 
get out of here so I can pack up 
these other orders.” He turned 
his back on Chandler.

VIII 



T>Y THE morning of the fourth 
^ day on the island of Oahu 
Chandler had learned enough of 
the ropes to have signed a money- 
chit at the Tripler currency office 
against Koitska’s account. 

That was about all he had 
learned, except for a few practical 
matters like where meals were 
served and the location of the 
fresh-water swimming pool at the 
back of the grounds. He was kill- 
ing time using the pool when, in 
the middle of a jacknife from the 
ten-foot board, he felt himself 
seized. He sprawled into the wa- 
ter with a hard splashing slap, 
threshed about and, as he came 
to the surface, found himself gig- 
gling. 

“Sorry, dear,” he apologized to 
himself, “but we don’t carry our 
weight in the same places, you 
know. Get that square-what’sit 
thingamajig, like an angel, and 
meet me in front by the flagpole 
in twenty minutes.” 

He recognized the voice, even 
if his own vocal chords had made 
it. It was the girl who had driven 
him back from the interview with 
Koitska, the one who had casual- 
ly announced she had saved his 
life at his hoaxing trial. Chand- 
ler swam to the side of the pool 
and toweled as he trotted toward 
his quarters. She was from Koits- 
ka now, of course; which meant 



that his “test” was about to be 
graded. 

Quickly though he dressed, she 
was there before him, standing 
beside a low-slung sports car and 
chatting with one of the grounds- 
keepers. An armful of leis dan- 
gled beside her, and although she 
wore the coronet which was evi- 
dence of her status the gardener 
did not seem to fear her. “Come 
along, love,” she called to Chand- 
ler. “Koitska wants your thin- 
gummy. Chuck it in the trunk if 
it’ll fit, and we’ll head waikiki 
wikiwiki. Don’t I say that nicely? 
But I only fool the malihinis, 
like you.” 

She chattered away as the lit- 
tle car dug its rear wheels into 
the drive and leaped around the 
green and out the gate. 

The wind howled by them, the 
sun was bright, the sky was 
piercingly blue. Riding next to 
this beautiful girl, it was hard 
for Chandler to remember that 
she was one of those who had de- 
stroyed his world. It was a ter- 
rible thing to have so much 
hatred and to feel it so diluted. 
Not even Koitska seemed a ter- 
rible enough enemy to accept 
such a load of detestation; it was 
hate without an object, and it 
recoiled on the hater, leaving him 
turgid and constrained. If he 
could not hate his onetime friend 
Jack Souther for defiling and de- 
stroying his wife, it was almost 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



143 



as hard to hate Souther’s anony- 
mous possessor. It could even 
have been Koitska. It could even 
have been this girl by his side. In 
the strange, cruel fantasies with 
which the Execs indulged them- 
selves it was likely enough that 
they would sometimes assume 
the body, and the role, of the 
opposite sex. Why not? Strange, 
ruthless morality; it was impos- 
sible to evaluate it by any human 
standards. 

It was also impossible to think 
of hatred with her beside him. 
They soared around Honolulu on 
a broad expressway and paral- 
leled the beach toward Waikiki. 
“Look, dear. Diamond Head! 
Mustn’t ignore it — very bad 
form — like not going to see 
the night-blooming cereus at the 
Punahou School. You haven’t 
missed that, have you?” 

“I’m afraid I have — ” 

“Rosalie. Call me Rosalie, 
dear.” 

“I’m afraid I have, Rosalie.” 
For some reason the name sound- 
ed familiar. 

“Shame, oh, shame! They say 
it was wonderful night before last 
Looks like cactus to me, but — ” 

Chandler’s mental processes 
had worked to a conclusion. 
“Rosalie Pan!” he said. “Now I 
know!” 

“Know what? You mean — ” 
she swerved around a motionless 
Buick, parked arrogantly five 



feet from the curb — “you mean 
you didn’t know who I was? And 
to think I used to pay five thou- 
sand a year for publicity.” 

Chandler said, smiling, and al- 
most relaxed, “I’m sorry, but 
musical comedies weren’t my 
strong point. I did see you once, 
though, on television. Then, let’s 
see, wasn’t there something about 
you disappearing — ” 

She nodded, glancing at him. 
“There sure was, dear. I almost 
froze to death getting out to that 
airport. Of course, it was worth it, 
I found out later. If I hadn’t been 
took; as they say, I would’ve been 
dead, because you remember 
what happened to New York 
about an hour later.” 

“You must have had some 
friends,” Chandler began, and let 
it trail off. So did the girl. After 
a moment she began to talk about 
the scenery again, pointing out 
the brick-red and purple bougain- 
villea, describing how the shore- 
line had looked before they’d 
“cleaned it up.” “Oh, thousands 
and thousands of the homeliest 
little houses. You’d have hated it. 
So we have done at least a few 
good things, anyway,” she said 
complacently, and began gently 
to probe into his life story. But 
as they stopped before the TWA 
message center, a few moments 
later, she said, “Well, love, it’s 
been fun. Go on in; Koitska’s ex- 
pecting you. I’ll see you later.” 



144

And her eyes added gently: I 
hope. 

^HANDLER got out of the car, 
turned . and felt himself 
taken. His voice said briskly, 
“Zdrastvoi, Rosie. Gd’yeh Koits- 
ka?” 

Unsurprised the girl pointed to 
the building. “Kto govorit?" 

Chandler’s voice answered in 
English, with a faint Oxford ac* 
cent: “It is I, Rosie, Kalman. 
Where’s Koitska’s tinkertoy? Oh, 
all right, thanks; I’ll just pick it 
up and take it in. Hope it’s all 
right. I must say one wearies of 
breaking in these new fellows.” 
Chandler’s body ambled around 
to the trunk of the car, took out 
the square-wave generator on its 
breadboard base and slouched in- 
to the building. It called ahead 
in the same language and was 
answered wheezily from above: 
Koitska. “Zdrastvoi. Iditye suda 
ko mneh. Kto, Kalman?” 

“Konyekhno!” cried Chandler’s 
voice and he was carried in and 
up to where the fat man lounged 
in a leather-upholstered wheel- 
chair. There was a conversation, 
long minutes of it, while the two 
men poked at the generator. 
Chandler did not understand a 
word until he spoke to himself: 
“You — what’s your name.” 
“Chandler,” Koitska filled in. 
“You, Chandler. D’you know 
anything at all about submilli- 



meter microwaves? Tell Koitska.” 
Briefly Chandler felt himself 
free — long enough to nod; then 
he was possessed again, and 
Koitska repeated the nod. “Good, 
then. Tell Koitska what experi- 
ence you’ve had.” 

Again free, Chandler said, “Not 
a great deal of actual experience. 
I worked with a group at Caltech 
on spectroscopic measurements 
in the million megacycle range. 
I didn’t design any of the equip- 
ment, though I helped put it to- 
gether.” He recited his degrees 
until Koitska raised a languid 
hand. 

“Shto, I don’t care. If ve gave 
you diagrams you could build?” 

“Certainly, if I had the equip- 
ment, I suppose I’d need — ” 

But Koitska stopped him 
again. “I know vot you need,” he 
said damply. “Enough. Ve see.” 
In a moment Chandler was taken 
again, and his voice and Koit- 
ska’s debated the matter for a 
while, until Koitska shrugged, 
turned his head and seemed to 
go to sleep. 

Chandler marched himself out 
of the room and out into the 
driveway before his voice said to 
him: “You’ve secured a position, 
then. Go back to Tripler until we 
send for you. It’ll be a few days, 
I expect.” 

And Chandler was free again. 

He was also alone. The girl in 
the Porsche was gone. The door 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



145 



of the TWA building had latched 
itself behind him. He stared 
around him, swore, shrugged and 
circled the building to the park- 
ing lot at back, on the chance 
that a car might be there for him 
to borrow. 

Luckily, there was. There were 
four, in fact, all with keys in 
them. He selected a Ford, puz- 
zled out the likeliest road back to 
Honolulu and turned the key in 
the starter. 

It was fortunate, he thought, 
that there had been several cars; 
if there had been only one he 
would not have dared to take 
it, for fear of stranding Koitska 
or some other exec who might 
easily blot him out in annoyance. 
He did not wish to join the 
wretches at the Monument. 

It was astonishing how readily 
fear had become a part of his 
life. 

The trouble with this position 
he had somehow secured — one 
of the troubles — was that there 
was no union delegate to settle 
employee grievances. Like no 
transportation. Like no clear idea 
of working hours, or duties. Like 
no mention at all — of course — 
of wages. Chandler had no idea 
what his rights were, if any at all, 
or of what the penalties would be 
if he overstepped them. 

The maimed victims at the 
Monument supplied a clue, of 
course. He could not really be- 



lieve that that sort of punishment 
would be applied for minor in- 
fractions. Death was so much less 
trouble. Even death was not real- 
ly likely, he thought, for a simple 
lapse. 

He thought 

He could not be sure, of course. 
He could be sure of only one 
thing: He was now a slave, com- 
pletely a slave, a slave until the 
day he died. Back on the main- 
land there was the statistical like- 
lihood of occasional slavery-by- 
possssion, but there it was only 
the body that was enslaved, and 
only for moments. Here, in the 
shadow of the execs, it was all of 
him, forever, until death or a 
miracle turned him loose. 

THE second day following 
he returned to his room at 
Tripler after breakfast, and found 
a Honolulu city policeman sitting 
hollow-eyed on the edge of his 
bed. The man stood up as Chand- 
ler came in. “So,” he grumbled, 
“you take so long! Here. Is dia- 
grams, specs, parts lists, all. You 
get everything three days from 
now, then we begin.” 

The policeman, no longer Koit- 
ska, shook himself, glanced stol- 
idly at Chandler and walked out, 
leaving a thick manila envelope 
on the pillow. On it was written, 
in a crabbed hand: All secref.' Do 
not show diagrams! 

Chandler opened the envelope 



146 



GALAXY 



and spilled its contents on the 
bed. 

An hour later he realized that 
sixty minutes had passed in 
which he had not been afraid. It 
was good to be working again, he 
thought, and then that thought 
faded away again as he returned 
to studying the sheaves of circuit 
diagrams and closely typed pages 
of specifications. It was not only 
work, it was hard work, and ab- 
sorbing. Chandler knew enough 
about the very short wavelength 
radio spectrum to know that the 
device he was supposed to build 
was no proficiency test; this was 
for real. The more he puzzled 
over it the less he could under- 
stand of its purpose. There was a 
transmitter and there was a re- 
ceiver. Astonishingly, neither was 
directional: that ruled out radar, 
for example. He rejected imme- 
diately the thought that the radi- 
ation was for spectrum analysis, 
as in the Caltech project — un- 
fortunate, because that was the 
only application with which he 
had first-hand familiarity; but 
impossible. The thing was too 
complicated. Nor could it be a 
simple message transmitter — no, 
perhaps it could, assuming there 
was a reason for using the sub- 
millimeter bands instead of the 
conventional, far simpler short- 
wave spectrum. Could it? The 
submillimeter waves were line- 
of-sight, of course, but would 



ionosphere scatter make it pos- 
sible for them to cover great dis- 
tances? He could not remember. 
Or was that irrelevant, since per- 
haps they needed only to cover 
the distances between islands in 
their own archipelago? But then, 
why all the power? And in any 
case, what about this fantastic 
switching panel, hundreds of 
square feet of it even though it 
was transistorized and subminia- 
turized and involving at least a 
dozen sophisticated technical re- 
finements he hadn’t the training 
quite to understand? AT&T 
could have handled every phone 
call in the United States with less 
switching than this — in the days 
when telephone systems spanned 
a nation instead of a fraction of 
a city. He pushed the papers to- 
gether in a pile and sat back, 
smoking a cigarette, trying to re- 
member what he could of the 
theory behind submillimeter radi- 
ation. 

At half a million megacycles 
and up, the domain of quantum 
theory began to be invaded. Ro- 
tating gas molecules, constricted 
to a few energy states, responded 
directly to the radio waves. 
Chandler remembered late-night 
bull sessions in Pasadena during 
which it had been pointed out 
that the possibilities in the field 
were enormous — although only 
possibilities, for there was no en- 
gineering way to reach them, and 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



147 



no clear theory to point the way 
— suggesting such strange ulti- 
mate practical applications as the 
receiverless radio, for example. 
Was that what he had here? 

He gave up. It was a question 
that would burn at him until he 
found the answer, but just now 
he had work to do, and he’d bet- 
ter be doing it. 

Skipping lunch entirely, he 
carefully checked the compo- 
nents lists, made a copy of what 
he would need, checked the or- 
iginal envelope and its contents 
with the man at the main receiv- 
ing desk for his safe, and caught 
the bus to Honolulu. 

At the Parts ’n Plenty store, 
Hsi read the list with a faint 
frown that turned into a puzzled 
scowl. When he put it down he 
looked at Chandler for a few 
moments without speaking. 

“Well, Hsi? Can you get all 
this for me?” The parts man 
shrugged and nodded. “Koitska 
said in three days.” 

Hsi looked startled, then re- 
signed. “That puts it right up to 
me, doesn’t it? All right. Wait a 
moment.” 

He disappeared in the back of 
the store, where Chandler heard 
him talking on what was evident- 
ly an intercom system. He came 
back in a few minutes and 
slipped Chandler’s list into a slit 
in the locked door. “Tough for 
Bert,” he said. “He’ll be working 



all night, getting started — but 
I can take it easy till tomorrow. 
By then he’ll know what we don’t 
have, and I’ll find some way to 
get it.” He shrugged again, but 
his face was lined. Chandler won- 
dered how one went about find- 
ing, for example, a thirty mega- 
watt klystron tube; but it was 
Hsi’s problem. He said: 

“All right. I’ll see you Mon- 
day.” 

“Wait a minute, Chandler.” 
Hsi eyed him. “You don’t have 
anything special to do, do you? 
Well, come have dinner with me. 
Maybe I can get to know you. 
Then maybe I can answer some 
of your questions, if you like.” 

rpHEY TOOK a bus out Kapi- 
olani Boulevard, then got 
out and walked a few blocks to 
a restaurant named Mother 
Chee’s. Hsi was well known 
there, it seemed. He led Chandler 
to a booth at the back, nodded 
to the waiter, ordered without 
looking at the menu and sat 
back. “You malihinis don’t know 
much about food,” he said, hu- 
morously patronizing. “I think 
you’ll like it. It’s all fish, any- 
way.” 

The man was annoying. Chand- 
ler was moved to say, “Too bad, 
I was hoping for duck in orange 
sauce, perhaps some snow 
peas — ” 

Hsi shook his head. “There’s 



148 



GALAXY 



meat, all right, but not here. 
You’ll only find it in the places 
where the execs sometimes go . 
Tell me something, Chandler. 
What’s that scar on your fore- 
head.” 

Chandler touched it, almost 
with surprise. Since the medics 
had treated it he had almost for- 
gotten it was there. He began to 
explain, then paused, looking at 
Hsi, and changed his mind. 
“What’s the score? You testing 
me, too? Want to see if I’ll lie 
about it?” 

Hsi grinned. “Sorry. I guess 
that’s what I was doing. I do 
know what an *H’ stands for; 
we’ve seen them before. Not 
many. The ones that do get this 
far usually don’t last long. Unless, 
of course, they are working for 
somebody whom it wouldn’t do 
to offend,” he explained. 

“So what you want to know, 
then, is whether I was really 
hoaxing or not. Does it make any 
difference?” 

“Damn right it does, man! 
We’re slaves, but we’re not ani- 
mals!” Chandler had gotten to 
him; the parts man looked 
startled, then sallow, as he ob- 
served his own vehemence. 

“Sorry, Hsi. It makes a differ- 
ence to me, too. Well, I wasn’t 
hoaxing. I was possessed, just 
like any other everyday rapist- 
murderer, only I couldn’t prove 
it. And it didn’t look too good for 



me, because the damn thing hap- 
pened in a pharmaceuticals plant. 
That was supposed to be about 
the only place in town where 
you could be sure you wouldn’t 
be possessed, or so everybody 
thought. Including me. Up to the 
time I went ape.” 

Hsi nodded. The waiter ap- 
proached with their drinks. Hsi 
looked at him appraisingly, then 
did a curious thing. He gripped 
his left wrist with his right hand, 
quickly, then released it again. 
The waiter did not appear to 
notice. Expertly he served the 
drinks, folded small pink floral 
napkins, dumped and wiped their 
ashtray in one motion — and 
then, so quickly that Chandler 
was not quite sure he had seen 
it, caught Hsi’s wrist in the same 
fleeting gesture just before he 
turned and walked away. 

Without comment Hsi turned 
back to Chandler. He said, “I 
believe you. Would you like to 
know why it happened? Because 
I think I can tell you. The execs 
have all the antibiotics they need 
now.” 

“You mean — ” Chandler hes- 
itated. 

“That’s right. They did leave 
some areas alone, as long as they 
weren’t fully stocked on every- 
thing they might want for the 
foreseeable future. Wouldn’t 
you?” 

“I might,” Chandler said cau- 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



149 



tiously, “if I knew what I was — 
being an exec.” 

Hsi said, “Eat your dinner. I’ll 
take a chance and tell you what 
I know.” He swallowed his whis- 
key-on-the-rocks with a quick 
backward jerk of the head. 
“They’re mostly Russians — you 
must know that much for your- 
self. The whole thing started in 
Russia.” 

Chandler said, “Well, that’s 
pretty obvious. But Russia was 
smashed up as much as anywhere 
else. The whole Russian govern- 
ment was killed — wasn’t it?” 

Hsi nodded. “They’re not the 
government. Not the exec. Com- 
munism doesn’t mean any more 
to them than the Declaration of 
Independence does — which is 
nothing. It’s very simple. Chand- 
ler: they’re a project that got out 
of hand.” 

T>ACK four years ago, he said, 
in Russia, it started in the 
last days of the Second Stalinite 
Regime, before the Neo-Krush- 
chevists took over power in the 
January Push. 

The Western World had not 
known exactly what was going 
on, of course. The “mystery 
wrapped in a riddle surrounded 
by an enigma” had become queer- 
er and even more opaque after 
Kruschchev’s death and the re- 
vival of such fine old Soviet in- 
stitutions as the Gay Pay Oo. 



That was the development called 
the Freeze, when the Stalinites 
seized control in the name of the 
sacred Generalissimo of the 
Soviet Fatherland, a mighty-mis- 
sile party, dedicated to bringing 
about the world revolution by 
force of sputnik. The neo-Krush- 
chevists, on the other hand, be- 
lieved that honey caught more 
flies than vinegar; and, although 
there were few visible adherents 
to that philosophy during the 
purges of the Freeze, they were 
not all dead. Then, out of the 
Donbas Electrical Workshop, 
came sudden support for their 
point of view. 

It was a weapon. It was more 
than a weapon, an irresistable 
tool — more than that, the way 
to end all disputes forever. It 
was a simple radio transmitter 
(Hsi said) — or so it seemed, 
but its frequencies were on an 
unusual band and its effects 
were remarkable. It controlled 
the minds of men. The “receiver” 
was the human brain. Through 
this little portable transmitter, 
surgically patch-wired to the 
brain of the person operating it, 
his entire personality was trans- 
mitted in a pattern of very short 
waves which could invade and 
modulate the personality of any 
other human being in the world. 
For that matter, of any animal, 
as long as the creature had 
enough “mind” to seize — 



150

“What’s the matter?” Hsi in- 
terrupted himself, staring at 
Chandler. Chandler had stopped 
eating, his hand frozen midway 
to his mouth. He shook his head. 

“Nothing. Go on.” Hsi shrugged 
and continued. 

While the Western World was 
celebrating Christmas — the 
Christmas before the first out- 
break of possession in the outside 
world — the man who invented 
the machine was secretly demon- 
strating it to another man. Both 
of them were now dead. The in- 
ventor had been a Pole, the other 
man a former Party leader who, 
four years before, had rescued 
the inventor’s dying father from 
a Siberian work camp. The Party 
leader had reason to congratulate 
himself on that loaf cast on the 
water. There were only three 
working models of the transmitter 

— what ultimately was refined 
into the coronet Chandler had 
seen on the heads of Koitska and 
the girl — but that was enough 
for the January push. 

The Stalinites were out. The 
neo-Krushchevists were in. 

A whole factory in the Donbas 
was converted to manufacturing 
these little mental controllers as 
fast as they could be produced 

— and that was fast, for they 
were simple in design to begin 
with and were quickly refined to 
a few circuits. Even the surgical 
wiring to the brain became un- 



necessary as induction coils 
tapped the encephalic rhythms. 
Only the great amplifying hookup 
was really complicated. Only one 
of those was necessary, for a sin- 
gle amplifier could serve as re- 
broadcaster — modulator for 
thousands of the headsets. 

“Are you sure you’re all right?” 
Hsi demanded. 

Chandler put down his fork, 
lit a cigarette and beckoned to 
the waiter. “I’m all right. I just 
want another drink.” 

He needed the drink. For now 
he knew what he was building 
for Koitska. 

^^HE waiter brought two more 
drinks and carried away the 
uneaten food. “We don’t know 
exactly who did what after that,” 
Hsi said, “but somehow or other 
it got out of hand. I think it was 
the technical crew of the factory 
that took over. I suppose it was 
an inevitable danger.” He grinned 
savagely. “I can just imagine the 
Party workers in the factory,” he 
said, “trying to figure out how 
to keep them in line — bribe 
them or terrify them? Give them 
dachas or send a quota to Siberia? 
Neither would work, of course, 
because there isn’t any bribe you 
can give to a man who only has 
to stretch out his hand to take 
over the world, and you can’t 
frighten a man who can make 
you slit your own throat. Any- 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



151 



way, the next thing that hap- 
pened — the following Christmas 
— was when they took over the 
world. It wasn’t a Party move- 
ment at all any more. A lot of 
the workers were Czechs and 
Hungarians and Poles, and the 
first thing they wanted to was to 
even a few scores. 

“So here they are! Before they 
let the whole world go bang they 
got out of range. They got them- 
selves out of Russia on two Red 
Navy cruisers, about a thousand 
of them; then they systematically 
triggered off every ballistic mis- 
sile they could find . and they 
could find all of them, sooner or 
later, it was just a matter of 
looking. As soon as it was safe 
they moved in here. Best place 
in the world for them. 

“There are only a thousand or 
so of them here on the Islands, 
and nobody outside the Islands 
even knows where they are. If 
they did, what good would it do 
them? They can kill anyone, any- 
where. They kill for fun, but 
sometimes they kill for a reason 
too. When one of them goes wan- 
dering for kicks he makes it a 
point to mess up all the trans- 
port and communications facili- 
ties he comes across — especially 
now, since they’ve stockpiled ev- 
rything they’re likely to need 
for the next twenty years. We 
don’t know what they’re planning 
to do when the twenty years are 



up. Maybe they don’t care. 
Would you?” 

Chandler drained his drink 
and shook his head. “One ques- 
tion,” he said. “Who’s ‘we’?” 

Hsi carefully unwrapped a 
package of cigarettes, took one 
out and lit it. He looked at it as 
though he were not enjoying it; 
cigarettes had a way of tasting 
stale these days. As they were. 
“Just a minute,” he said. 

Tardily Chandler remembered 
the quick grasp of the waiter’s 
fingers on Hsi’s wrist, and that 
the waiter had been hovering, in- 
conspicuously close, all through 
their meal. Hsi was waiting for 
the man to return. 

In a moment the waiter was 
back, looking directly at Chand- 
ler. He looped his own wrist with 
his fingers and nodded. Hsi said 
softly, “ ‘We’ ” is the Society of 
Slaves. That’s all of us — slaves 
— but only a few of us belong to 
the Society. We — ” 

There was a crash of glass. 
The waiter had dropped their 
tray. 

Across the table from Chand- 
ler, Hsi looked suddenly changed. 
His left hand lay on the table 
before him, his right hand poised 
over it. Apparently he had been 
about to show Chandler again 
the sign he had made. 

But he could not do it. His 
hand paused and fluttered, like 
a captured bird. Captured it was.

Hsi was captured. Out of Hsi’s 
mouth, with Hsi’s voice, came the 
light, tonal rhythms of Rosalie 
Pan. “This is an unexpected 
pleasure, love! I never expected 
to see you here. Enjoying your 
meal?” 

IX 

^HANDLER had his empty 
^ glass halfway to his lips, au- 
tomatically, before he realized 
there was nothing in it to brace 
him. He said hoarsely, “Yes, 
thanks. Do you come here of- 
ten?” It was like the banal talk 
of a language guide, wildly inap- 
propriate to what had been going 
on a moment before. He was 
shaken. 

“Oh, I love it,” cooed Hsi, in- 
vestigating the dishes before him. 
“All finished, I see. Too bad. 
Your friend doesn’t feel like he 
ate much, either.” 

“I guess he wasn’t hungry,” 
Chandler managed. 

‘Well, I am.” Hsi cocked his 
head and smiled like a female 
impersonator. “I know! Are you 
doing anything special right now, 
love? I know you’ve eaten, but — 
well, I’ve been a good girl and I 
guess I can eat a real meal, I 
mean not with somebody else’s 
teeth, and still keep the calories 
in line. Suppose I meet you down 
at the Beach? There’s a place 
there where the luau is divine. I 



can be there in half an hour.” 

Chandler’s breathing was back 
to normal. Why not? “I’ll be de- 
lighted.” 

“Luigi the Wharf Rat, that’s 
the name of it. They won’t let 
you in, though, unless you tell 
them you’re with me. It’s special.” 
Hsi’s eye closed in Rosalie Pan’s 
wink. “Half an hour,” Hsi said, 
and was again himself. He began 
to shake. 

The waiter brought him 
straight whiskey and, pretense 
abandoned, stood by while Hsi 
drank it. After a moment he said, 
“Scares you. But — I guess we’re 
all right. She couldn’t have heard 
much. You’d better go. Chandler. 
I’ll talk to you again some other 
time.” 

Chandler stood up. But he 
couldn’t leave Hsi like that. “Are 
you all right?” 

Hsi almost managed control. 
“Oh — I think so. Not the first 
time it’s come close, you know. 
Sooner or later it’ll come closer 
still, and that will be the end, but 
— yes, I’m all right for now.” 

Chandler tarried. “You were 
saying something about the So- 
ciety of Slaves.” 

“Damn it, go!” Hsi barked. 
“She’ll be waiting for you . 
Sorry, I didn’t mean to shout. 
But go.” As Chandler turned, he 
said more quietly, “Come around 
to the store tomorrow. Maybe 
we can finish our talk then.”

T UIGI the Wharf Rat’s was not 
actually on the beach but on 
the bank of a body of water 
called the Ala Wai Canal. Across 
the water were the snowtopp>ed 
hills. A maitre-de escorted Chand- 
ler personally to a table on a bal- 
cony, and there he waited. Ros- 
alie “half-hour” was nearly two; 
but then he heard her calling him 
from across the room, in the voice 
which had reached a thousand 
second balconies, and he rose as 
she came near. 

She said lightly, “Sorry. You 
ought to be flattered, though. It’s 
a twenty-minute drive — and an 
hour and a half to put on my 
face, so you won’t be ashamed to 
be seen with me. Well, it’s good 
to be out in my own skin for a 
change. Let’s eat!” 

The talk with Hsi had left a 
mark on Chandler that not even 
this girl’s pretty face could ob- 
scure. It was a pretty face, 
though, and she was obviously 
exerting herself to make him en- 
joy himself. He could not help 
responding to her mood. 

She talked of her life on the 
stage, the excitement of a per- 
formance, the entertainers she 
had known. Her conversation 
was one long name-drop, but it 
was not pretense: the world of 
the famous was the world she 
had lived in. It was not a world 
that Chandler had ever visited, 
but he recognized the names. 



Rosie had been married once to 
an English actor whose movies 
Chandler had made a point of 
watching on television. It was in- 
teresting, in a way, to know that 
the man snored and lived princi- 
pally on vitamin pills. But it was 
a view of the man that Chandler 
had not sought. 

The restaurant drew its clien- 
tele mostly from the execs, young 
ones or young-acting ones, like 
the girl. The coronets were all 
over. There had been a sign on 
the door: 

KAPU, WALIHINI! 

to mark it off limits to anyone 
not an exec or a collaborator. 
Still, Chandler thought, who on 
the island was not a collaborator? 
The only effective resistance a 
man could make would be to kill 
everyone within reach and then 
himself, thus depriving them of 
slaves — and that was, after all, 
only what the execs themselves 
had done in other places often 
enough. It would inconvenience 
them only slightly. The next few 
planeloads or shiploads of pos- 
sessed warm bodies from the 
mainland would be permitted to 
live, instead of being required to 
dash themselves to destruction, 
like the crew of the airplane that 
had carried Chandler. Thus the 
domestic stocks would be replen- 
ished.

GALAXY 



An annoying feature of dining 
with Rosalie in the flesh, Chand- 
ler found, was that half a dozen 
times while they were talking he 
found himself taken, speaking 
words to Rosie that were not his 
own, usually in a language he did 
not understand. She took it as a 
matter of course. It was merely 
a friend, across the room or across 
the island, using Chandler as the 
casual convenience of a tele- 
phone. “Sorry,” she apologized 
blithely after it happened for the 
third time, and then stopped. 
“You don’t like that, love, do 
you?” 

“Can you blame me?” He stop- 
ped himself from saying more; 
he was astonished even so at his 
tone. 

She said it for him. “I know. It 
takes away your manhood, I sup- 
pose. Please don’t let it do that 
to you, love. We’re not so bad. 
Even — ” She hesitated, and did 
not go on. “You know,” she said, 
“I came here the same way you 
did. Kidnaped off the stage of the 
Winter Garden. Of course, the 
difference was the one who kid- 
naped me was an old friend. 
Though I didn’t know it at the 
time and it scared me half to 
death.” 

Chandler must have looked 
startled. She nodded. “You’ve 
been thinking of us as another 
race, haven’t you? Like the Ne- 
anderthals or — well, worse than 



that, maybe.” She smiled. “We’re 
not. About half of us came from 
Russia in the first place, but the 
others are from all over. You’d 
be astonished, really.” She men- 
tioned several names, world-fam- 
ous scientists, musicians, writers. 
“Of course, not everybody can 
qualify for the club, love. Would- 
n’t be exclusive otherwise. The 
chief rule is loyalty. I’m loyal,” 
she added gently after a moment, 
“and don’t you forget it. Have to 
be. Whoever becomes an exec has 
to be with us, all the way. There 
are tests. It has to be that way — 
not only for our protection. For 
the world’s.” 

Chandler was genuinely star- 
tled at that. Rosie nodded seri- 
ously. “If one exec should give 
away something he’s not sup- 
posed to it would upset the whole 
applecart. There are only a thou- 
sand of us, and I guess probably 
two billion of you, or nearly. The 
result would be complete de- 
struction.” 

Of the Executive Committee, 
Chandler thought she meant at 
first, but then he thought again. 
No. Of the world. For the thou- 
sand execs, outnumbered though 
they were two million to one, 
could not fail to triumph. The 
contest would not be in doubt. 
If the whole thousand execs at 
once began systematically to kill 
and destroy, instead of merely 
playing at it as the spirit moved 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



155 



them, they could all but end the 
human race overnight. A man 
could be made to slash his throat 
in a quarter of a minute. An exec, 
killing, killing, killing without 
pause, could destroy his own two 
million enemies in an eight-hour 
day. 

And there were surer, faster 
ways. Chandler did not have to 
imagine them, he had seen them. 
The massacre of the Orphalese, 
the victims at the Monument — 
they were only crumbs of destruc- 
tion. What had happened to New 
York City showed what mass- 
production methods could do. No 
doubt there were bombs left, even 
if only chemical ones. Shoot, stab, 
crash, blow up; swallow poison, 
leap from window, slit throat. 
Every man a murderer, at the 
touch of a mind from Hawaii; 
and if no one else was near to 
murder, surely each man could 
find a victim in himself. In one 
ravaging day mankind would 
cease to exist as a major force. In 
a week the only survivors would 
be those in such faroff and hope- 
lessly impotent places that they 
were not worth the trouble of 
tracking down. 

i^VT'OU hate us, don’t you?” 

Chandler paused and 
tried to find an answer. Rosie 
was not either belligerent or 
mocking. She was only sympa- 
thetically trying to reach his point 



of view. He shook his head silent- 
ly. 

“Not meaning ‘no’ — meaning 
‘no comment’? Well, I don’t blame 
you, love. But do you see that 
we’re not altogether a bad thing? 
It’s bad that there should be so 
much violence. In a way. Hasn’t 
there always been violence? And 
what were the alternatives? Until 
we came along the world was get- 
ting ready to kill itself anyway.” 

“There’s a difference,” Chand- 
ler mumbled. He was thinking of 
his wife. He and Margot had 
loved each other as married 
couples do — without any very 
great, searing compulsion; but 
with affection, with habit and 
with sporadic passion. Chandler 
had not given much thought to 
the whole, though he was aware 
of the parts, during the last years 
of his marriage. It was only after 
Margot’s murder that he had 
come to know that the sum of 
those parts was a quite irreplace- 
able love. 

But Rosie was shaking her 
head. “The difference is all on 
our side. Suppose Koitska’s boss 
had never discovered the coro- 
nets. At any moment one country 
might have got nervous and 
touched off the whole thing — 
not carefully, the way we did it, 
with most of the really dirty mis- 
siles fused safe and others land- 
ing where they were supposed to 
go. I mean, touched off a war. 



156 



GALAXY 



The end, love. The bloody finis. 
The ones that were killed at once 
would have been the lucky ones. 
No, love,” she said, in dead earn- 
est, “we aren’t the worst things 
that ever happened to the world. 
Once the — well, the bad part — 
is over, people will understand 
what we really are.” 

“And what’s that, exactly?” 
She hesitated, smiled and said 
modestly, “We’re gods.” 

It took Chandler’s breath 
away — not because it was un- 
true, but because it had never 
occurred to him that gods were 
aware of their deity. 

“We’re gods, love, with the 
privilege of electing mortals to 
the club. Don’t judge us by any- 
thing that has gone before. Don’t 
judge us by anything. We are a 
New Thing. We don’t have to 
conform to precedent because we 
upset all precedents. From now 
on, to the end of time, the rules 
will grow from us.” 

She patted her lips briskly 
with a napkin and said, “Would 
you like to see something? Let’s 
take a little walk.” 

She took him by the hand and 
led him across the room, out to 
a sundeck on the other side of 
the restaurant. They were look- 
ing down on what had once been 
a garden. There were people in 
it; Chandler was conscious of 
sounds coming from them, and 
he was able to see that there were 



dozens of them, perhaps a hun- 
dred, and that they all seemed to 
be wearing suntans like his own. 

“From Tripler?” he guessed. 

“No, love. They pick out those 
clothes themselves. Stand there 
a minute.” 

The girl in the coronet walked 
out to the rail of the sundeck, 
where pink and amber spotlights 
were playing on nothing. As she 
came into the colored lights there 
was a sigh from the people in the 
garden. A man walked forward 
with an armload of leis and de- 
posited them on the ground be- 
low the rail. 

They were adoring her. 

Rosalie stood gravely for a 
moment, then nodded and re- 
turned to Chandler. 

“They began doing that about 
a year ago,” she whispered to 
him, as a murmur of disappoint- 
ment came up from the crowd. 
“Their own idea. We didn’t know 
what they wanted at first, but 
they weren’t doing any harm. 
You see, love,” she said softly, 
“we can make them do anything 
we like. But we don't make them 
do that.” 

TTOURS later, Chandler was 
not sure just how, they were 
in a light plane flying high over 
the Pacific, clear out of sight of 
land. The moon was gold above 
them, the ocean black beneath. 

Chandler stared down as the 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



157 



girl circled the plane, slipping 
lower toward the water, silent 
and perplexed. But he was not 
afraid. He was almost content. 
Rosie was good company — gay, 
cheerful — and she had treasures 
to share. It had been an impulse 
of hers, a long drive in her sports 
car and a quick, comfortable 
flight over the ocean to cap the 
evening. It had been a pleasant 
impulse. He reflected gravely 
that he could understand now 
how generations of country maid- 
ens had been dazzled and de- 
spoiled. A touch of luxury was a 
great seducer. 

The coronet on the girl’s body 
could catch his body at any mo- 
ment. She had only to think her- 
self into his mind, and her will, 
flashed to a relay station like the 
one he was building for Koitska, 
at loose in infinity, could sweep 
into him and make him a puppet. 
If she chose, he would open that 
door beside him and step out 
into a thousand feet of air and a 
meal for the sharks. 

But he did not think she would 
do it. He did not think anyone 
would, really, though with his 
own eyes he had seen some any- 
ones do things as bad as that and 
sickeningly worse. There was no 
corrupt whim of the most dis- 
eased mind in history that some 
torpid exec had not visited on a 
helpless man, woman or child in 
the past years. Even as they flew 



here. Chandler knew, the gross 
bodies that lay in luxury in the 
island’s villas were surging rest- 
lessly around the world; and 
death and horror remained where 
they had passed. It was a paradox 
too great to be reconciled, this 
girl and this vileness. He could 
not forget it, but he could not 
feel it in his glands. She was 
pretty. She was gay. He began 
to think thoughts that had left 
him alone for a long time. 

The dark bulk of the island 
showed ahead and they were sink- 
ing toward a landing. 

The girl landed skillfully on a 
runway that sprang into light as 
she approached — electronic wiz- 
ardry, or the coronet and some 
tethered serf at a switch? It did- 
n’t matter. Nothing mattered very 
greatly at that moment to Chand- 
ler. 

“Thank you, love,” she said, 
laughing. “I liked that. It’s all 
very well to use someone else’s 
body for this sort of thing, but 
every now and then I want to 
keep my own in practice.” 

She linked arms with him as 
they left the plane. “When I was 
first given the coronet here,” she 
reminisced, amusement in her 
voice, “I got the habit real bad. 
I spent six awful months — 
really, six months in bed! And 
by myself at that. Oh, I was all 
over the world, and skin-diving on 
the Barrier Reef and skiing in 



158 



GALAXY 



Norway and — well,” she said, 
squeezing his arm, “never mind 
what all. And then one day I got 
on the scales, just out of habit. 
Do you know what I weighed?’* 
She closed her eyes in mock hor- 
ror, but they were smiling when 
she opened them again, “I won’t 
do that again, love. Of course, a 
lot of us do let ourselves go. Even 
Koitska. Especially Koitska. And 
some of the women — But just 
between us, the ones who do 
really didn’t have much to keep 
in shape in the first place.” 

She led the way into a villa 
that smelled of jasmine and 
gardenias, snapped her fingers 
and subdued lights came on. 
“Like it? Oh, we’ve nothing but 
the best. What would you like 
to drink?” 

She fixed them both tall, cold 
glasses and vetoed Chandler’s 
choice of a sprawling wicker 
chair to sit on. “Over here, love.” 
She patted the couch beside her. 
She drew up her legs, leaning 
against him, very soft, warm and 
fragrant, and said dreamily, “Let 
me see. What’s nice? What do 
you like in music, love?” 

“Oh . anything.” 

“No, no! You’re supposed to 
say, *Why, the original-cast album 
from Hi There.’ Or anything else 
I starred in.” She shook her head 
reprovingly, and the points of her 
coronet caught golden reflections 
from the lights. “But since you’re 



obviously a man of low taste I’ll 
have to do the whole bit myself.” 
She touched switches at a remote- 
control set by her end of the 
couch, and in a moment dreamy 
strings began to come from tri- 
aural speakers hidden around the 
room. It was not Hi There. 
“That’s better,” she said drowsily, 
and in a moment, “Wasn’t it nice 
in the plane?” 

“It was fine,” Chandler said. 
Gently — but firmly — he sat 
up and reached automatically in- 
to his pocket. 

The girl sighed and straight- 
ened. “Cigarette? They’re on the 
table beside you. Hope you like 
the brand. They only keep one 
big factory going, not to count 
those terrible Russian things 
that’re all air and no smoke.” She 
touched his forehead with cool 
fingers. “You never told me about 
that, love.” 

It was like an electric shock 
— the touch of her fingers and 
the touch of reality at once. 
Chandler said stiffly, “My brand. 
But I thought you were there at 
the trial.” 

“Oh, only now and then. I 
missed all the naughty parts — 
though, to tell the truth, that’s 
why I was hanging around. I do 
like to hear a little naughtiness 
now and then . but all I heard 
was that stupid lawyer and that 
stupid judge. Made me mad.” 
She giggled. “Lucky for you. I 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



159 



was so irritated I decided to sp>oil 
their fun too.” 

^HANDLER sat up and took a 
^ long pull at his drink- Curi- 
ously, it seemed to sober him. He 
said: “It’s nothing. I happened to 
rape and kill a young girl. Hap- 
pens every day. Of course, it was 
one of your friends that was doing 
it for me, but I didn’t miss any 
of what was going on, I can give 
you a blow-by-blow description 
if you like. The people in the 
town where I lived, at that time, 
thought I was doing it on my 
own, though, and they didn’t ap- 
prove. Hoaxing — you know? 
They thought I was so perverse 
and cruel that I would do that 
sort of thing under my own 
power, instead of with some exec 
— or, as they would have put it, 
being ignorant, some imp, or 
devil, or demon — pulling the 
strings.” 

He was shaking. He waited for 
what she had to say; but she 
only whispered, “I’m sorry, love,” 
and looked so contrite and honest 
that, as rapidly as it had come 
upon him, his anger passed. 

He opened his mouth to say 
something to her. He didn’t get 
it said. She was sitting there, 
looking at him, alone and soft 
and inviting. He kissed her; and 
as she returned the kiss, he kissed 
her again, and again. 

But less than an hour later he 



was in her Porsche, cold sober, 
raging, frustrated, miserable. He 
slammed it through the unfamil- 
iar gears as he sped back to the 
city. 

She had left him- They had 
kissed with increasing passion, his 
hands playing about her, her 
body surging toward him, and 
then, just then, she whispered, 
“No, love-” He held her tighter 
and without another word she 
opened her eyes and looked at 
him. 

He knew what mind it was 
that caught him then. It was her 
mind. Stiffly, like wood, he re- 
leased her, stood up, walked to 
the door and locked it behind 
him. 

The lights in the villa went 
out. He stood there, boiling, look- 
ing into the shadows through the 
great, wide, empty window. He 
could see her lying there on the 
couch, and as he watched he saw 
her body toss and stir; and as 
surely as he had ever known any- 
thing before he knew that some- 
where in the world some woman 
— or some man! — lay locked 
with a lover, violent in love, and 
was unable to tell the other that 
a third party had invaded their 
bed. 

Chandler did not know it until 
he saw something glistening on 
his wrist, but he was weeping on 
the wild ride back to Honolulu 
in the car. Her car. Would there 



160 



GALAXY 



be trouble for his taking it? God, 
let there be trouble! He was in a 
mood for trouble. He was sick 
and wild with revulsion. 

Worse than her use of him, a 
casual stimulant, an aphrodisiac 
touch, was that she thought what 
she did was right. Chandler 
thought of the worshipping doz- 
ens under the sundeck of the 
exec restaurant, and Rosalie’s 
gracious benediction as they 
made her their floral offerings. 
Blind, pathetic fools! 

Not only the deluded men and 
women in the garden were wor- 
shippers trapped in a vile re- 
ligion, he thought. It was worse. 
The gods and goddesses worship- 
ped at their own divinity as well! 

X 

^^HREE days later Koitska’s 
voice, coming from Chand- 
ler’s lips, summoned him out to 
the TWA shack again. 

Wise now in the ways of this 
world. Chandler commandeered 
a police car and was hurried out 
to the South Gate, where the 
guards allowed him a car of his 
own. The door of the building 
was unlocked and Chandler went 
right up. 

He was astonished. The fat 
man was actually sitting up. He 
was fully dressed — more or 
less; incongruously he wore 
flowered shorts and a bright red. 



short-sleeve shirt, with rope san- 
dals. He said, “You fly a iili- 
kopter? No? No difference. Help 
me.” An arm like a mountain 
went over Chandler’s shoulders. 
The man must have weighed 
three hundred pounds. Slowly, 
wheezing, he limped toward the 
back of the room and touched a 
button. 

A door opened. 

Chandler had not known be- 
fore that there was an elevator 
in the building. That was one of 
the things the exec did not con- 
sider important for his slaves to 
know. It lowered them with great 
grace and delicacy to the first 
floor, where a large old Cadillac, 
ancient but immaculately kept, 
the kind that used to be called 
a “gangster’s car,” waited in a 
private parking bay. 

Chandler followed Koitska’s 
directions and drove to an air- 
field where a small, Plexiglas- 
nosed helicopter waited. More by 
the force of Chandler pushing 
him from behind than through 
his own fat thighs, Koitska puffed 
up the little staircase into the 
cabin. Originally the copter had 
been fitted for four passengers. 
Now there was the pilot’s seat 
and a seat beside it, and in the 
back a wide, soft couch. Koitska 
collapsed onto it. His face blank- 
ed out — he was, Chandler knew, 
somewhere else, just then. 

In a moment his eyes opened 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



161 



again. He looked at Chandler 
with no interest at all, and turned 
his face to the wall. 

After a moment he wheezed. 
“Sit down. At de controls.” He 
breathed noisily for a while. 
Then, “It von’t pay you to be in- 
terested in Rosalie,” he said. 

Chandler was startled. He 
craned around in the seat but 
saw only Koitska’s back. “I’m 
not! Or anyway — ” But he had 
no place to go in that sentence, 
and in any case Koitska no long- 
er seemed interested. 

After a moment Koitska stir- 
red, settled himself more com- 
fortably, and Chandler felt him- 
self taken. He turned to face the 
split wheel and the unfamiliar 
pedals and watched himself work 
the controls. It was an admirable 
performance. Whoever Chandler 
was just then — he could not 
guess — he was a first-class heli- 
copter pilot. 

^^HEY crossed a wide body of 
■*- ocean and approached an- 
other island; from one quick 
glance at a navigation map that 
his eyes had taken, Chandler 
guessed it to be Hilo. He landed 
the craft expertly on the margin 
of a small airstrip, where two 
DC-3s were already parked and 
being unloaded, and felt himself 
free again. 

Two husky young men, appar- 
ently native Hawaiians by their 



size, rolled up a ramp and as- 
sisted Koitska down it and into a 
building. Chandler was left to his 
own devices. The building was 
rundown but sound. Around it 
stalky grass clumped, long uncut, 
and a few mauve and scarlet 
blossoms, almost hidden, showed 
where someone had once tended 
beds of bougainvillea and poin- 
settias. He could not guess what 
the building had been doing 
there, looking like a small office- 
factory combination out in the 
remote wilds, until he caught 
sight of a sign the winds had 
blown against a wall: Dole. Ap- 
parently this had been headquar- 
ters for one of the plantations. 
Now it was stripped almost clean 
inside, a welter of desks and 
rusted machines piled heedlessly 
where there once had been a 
parking lot New equipment was 
being loaded into it from the 
cargo planes. Chandler recog- 
nized some of it as from the list 
he had given the parts man, Hsi. 
There also seemed to be a gaso- 
line-driven generator — a large 
one — but what the other things 
were he could not guess. 

Besides Koitska, there were at 
least five coronet-wearing execs 
visible around the place. Chand- 
ler was not surprised. It would 
have to be something big to 
winkle these torpid slugs out of 
their shells, but he knew what it 
was, and that it was big enough

to them indeed; in fact, it was 
their lives. He deduced that Koit- 
ska’s plans for his future comfort 
required a standby transmitter 
to service the coronets, in case 
something went wrong. And 
clearly it was this that they were 
to put together here. 

For ten hours, while the after- 
noon became dark night, they 
worked at a furious pace. When 
the sun set one of the execs ges- 
tured and the generator was 
started, rocking on its rubber- 
tired wheels as its rotors spun 
and fumes chugged out, and they 
worked on by strings of incan- 
descent lights. It was pick-and- 
shovel work for Chandler, no en- 
gineering, just unloading and 
roughly grouping the equipment 
where it was ready to be assem- 
bled. The execs did not take part 
in the work. Nor were they idle. 
They busied themselves in one 
room of the building with some 
small device — Chandler could 
not see what — and when he 
looked again it was gone. He did 
not see them take it away and 
did not know where it was taken. 
Toward midnight he suddenly 
realized that it was likely some 
essential part which they would 
not permit anyone but them- 
selves to handle, and that, no 
doubt, was why they had come in 
person, instead of working 
through proxies. 

Just before they left Koitska 



and two or three of the other 
execs quizzed him briefly. He 
was too tired to think beyond 
the questions, but they seemed to 
be trying to find out if he was 
able to do the simpler parts of 
the construction without super- 
vision, and they seemed satisfied 
with the answers. He flew the 
helicopter home, with someone 
else guilding his arms and legs, 
but he was half asleep as he did 
it, and he never quite remem- 
bered how he managed to get 
back to his room at Tripler. 

nPHE next morning he went 
back to Parts ’n Plenty with 
an additional list, covering re- 
placement of some parts that had 
been damaged. Hsi glanced at it 
quickly and nodded. “All this 
stuff I have. You can pick it up 
this afternoon if you like.” 

Chandler offered him a cigar- 
ette out of a stale pack. “About 
the other night — ” 

Hsi began to perspire, but he 
said, casually enough, “Interested 
in baseball?” 

“Baseball?” 

Hsi said, as though there had 
been nothing incongruous about 
the question, “There’ll be a Little 
League game this afternoon. Back 
of the school on Punahou and 
Wilder. I thought I might stop 
by, then we can come back and 
pick up the rest of your gear. 
Two o’clock. Hope 111 see you.”

GALAXY 



Chandler walked away thought- 
fully. He had no real intention 
of going there, but something in 
Hsi’s attitude suggested more 
than a ball game; after a quick 
and poor lunch he decided to go. 

The field was a dirty play- 
ground, scuffed out of what had 
probably once been an attractive 
campus. The players were ten- 
year-olds, of the mixture of hair 
colors and complexions typical 
of the islands. Chandler was puz- 
zled. Surely even the wildest 
baseball rooter wouldn’t go far 
out of his way for this, and yet 
there was an audience of at least 
fifty adults watching the game. 
And none seemed to be related 
to the ballplayers. The Little 
Leaguers played grave, careful 
ball, and the audience watched 
them without a word of parental 
encouragement or joy. 

Hsi approached him from the 
shadow of the school building. 
“Glad you could make it, Chand- 
ler. No, no questions. Just watch.” 

In the fifth inning, with the 
score aggregating around thirty, 
there was an interruption. A tall, 
red-headed man glanced at his 
watch, licked his lips, took a deep 
breath and walked out onto the 
diamond. He glanced at the 
crowd, while the kids suspended 
play without surprise. Then the 
red-headed man nodded to the 
umpire and stepped off the field. 
The ballplayers resumed their 



game, but now the whole atten- 
tion of the audience was on the 
red-headed man. 

Suspicion crossed Chandler’s 
mind. In a moment it was con- 
firmed, as the red-headed man 
raised his hands waist high and 
clasped his right hand around 
his left wrist — only for a mo- 
ment, but that was enough. 

The ball game was a cover. 
Chandler was present at a meet- 
ing of what Hsi had called The 
Society of Slaves, the under- 
ground that dared to pit itself 
against the execs. 

Hsi cleared his throat and said, 
“This is the one. I vouch for him.” 
And that was startling too. 
Chandler thought, because all 
these wrist-circled men and wom- 
en were looking at him. 

46 A LL right,” said the red- 
headed man nervously, 
“let’s get started then. First thing, 
anybody got any weapons? Sure? 
Take a look — we don’t want 
any slipups. Turn out your pock- 
ets.” 

There was a flurry and a wom- 
an near Chandler held up a key 
ring with a tiny knife on it. “Pen- 
knife? Hell, yes; get rid of it 
Throw it in the outfield. You can 
pick it up after the meeting.” A 
hundred eyes watched the pearly 
object fly. “We ought to be all 
right here,” said the red-headed 
man. “The kids have been play- 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS

ing every day this week and no- 
body looked in. But watch your 
neighbor. See anything suspi- 
cious, don’t wait. Don’t take a 
chance. Holler TCill the umpire!’ 
or an5Tthing you like, but holler. 
Good and loud.” He paused, 
breathing hard. “All right, Hsi. 
Introduce him.” 

The parts man took Chandler 
firmly by the shoulder. “This fel- 
low has something for us,” he 
said. “He’s working for the exec 
Koitska, building what can’t be 
anything else but a duplicate of 
the machine that they use to con- 
trol us. He — ” 

“Wait a minute!” A bearded 
man came forward and peered 
furiously into Chandler’s face. 
“Look at his head! Don’t you see 
he’s branded?” 

Chandler touched his scar as 
the man with the beard hissed, 
“Damned hoaxer! This is the low- 
est species of life on the face of 
the earth — someone who pre- 
tended to be possessed in order 
to do some damned dirty act. 
What was it, hoaxer? Murder? 
Burning babies alive?” 

Hsi economically let go of 
Chandler’s shoulder, half turned 
the bearded man with one hand 
and swung with the other. “Shut 
up, Linton. Wait till you hear 
what he’s got for us.” 

The bearded man, sprawling 
and groggy, slowly rose as Hsi 
explained tersely what he had 



guessed of Chandler’s work — as 
much as Chandler himself knew, 
it seemed. “Maybe this is only a 
duplicate. Maybe it won’t be 
used. But maybe it will — and 
Chandler’s the man who can sabo- 
tage it! How would you like that? 
The execs switching over to this 
equipment while the other one 
is down for maintenance — and 
their headsets don’t work!” 

There was a terrible silence, 
except for the sounds of the chil- 
dren playing ball. Two runs had 
just scored. Chandler recognized 
the silence. It was hope. 

Linton broke it, his blue eyes 
gleaming above the beard. “No! 
Better than that. Why wait? We 
can use this fellow’s machine. Set 
it up, get us some headsets — 
and we can control the execs 
themselves!” 

^T^HE silence was even longer; 

then there was a babble of 
discussion, but Chandler did not 
take part in it. He was thinking. 
It was a tremendous thought. 

Suppose a man like himself 
were actually able to do what 
they wanted of him. Never mind 
the practical difficulties — learn- 
ing how it worked, getting a head- 
set, bypassing the traps Koitska 
would surely have set to prevent 
just that. Never mind the penal- 
ties for failure. Suppose he could 
make it work, and find fifty head- 
sets, and fit them to the fifty men 



166 



GALAXY 



and women here in this clandes- 
tine meeting of the Society of 
Slaves . 

Would there, after all, be any 
change worth mentioning in the 
state of the world? 

Or was Lord Acton, always 
and everywhere, right? Power 
corrupts. Absolute power corrupts 
absolutely. The power locked in 
the coronets of the exec was more 
than flesh and blood could stand; 
he could almost sense the rot in 
those near him at the mere 
thought. 

But Hsi was throwing cold 
water on the idea. “Sorry, but I 
know that much: One exec can’t 
control another. The headpieces 
insulate against control. Well.” 
He glanced at his watch. “We 
agreed on twenty minutes maxi- 
mum for this meeting,” he re- 
minded the red-headed man, who 
nodded. 

“You’re right.” He glanced 
around the group. “I’ll make the 
rest of it fast. News: You all 
know they got some more of us 
last week. Have you all been by 
the Monument? Three of our 
comrades were still there this 
morning. But I don’t think they 
know we’re organized, they think 
it’s only individual acts of sabo- 
tage. In case any of you don’t 
know, the execs can’t read our 
minds. Not even when the5r’re 
controlling us. Proof is we’re all 
still alive. Hanrahan knew prac- 



tically every one of us, and he’s 
been lying out there for a week 
with a broken back, ever since 
they caught him trying to blow 
up the guard pits at East Gate. 
They had plenty of chance to 
pump him if they could. They 
can’t. Next thing. No more indi- 
vidual attacks on one exec. Not 
unless it’s a matter of life and 
death, and even then you’re 
wasting your time unless you’ve 
got a gun. They can grab your 
mind faster than you can cut 
a throat. Third thing: Don’t get 
the idea there are good execs and 
bad execs. Once they put that 
thing on their heads they’re all 
the same. Fourth thing. You can’t 
make deals. They aren’t that 
worried. So if anybody’s thinking 
of selling out — I’m not saying 
anyone is — forget it.” He looked 
around. “Anything else?” 

‘What about germ warfare in 
the water supply?” somebody 
ventured. 

“Still looking into it. No report 
yet. All right, that’s enough for 
now. Meeting’s adjourned. Watch 
the ball game for a while, then 
drift away. One at a time.** 

Hsi was the first to go, then a 
couple of women together, then 
a sprinkling of other men. Chand- 
ler was in no particular hurry, al- 
though it seemed time to leave 
anyway, because the ball game 
app>eared to be over. A ten-year- 
old with freckles on his face was 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



167 



at the plate, but he was leaning 
on his bat, staring at Chandler 
with wide, serious eyes. 

Chandler felt a sudden chill. 
He turned, began to walk 
away — and felt himself seized. 

TTE WALKED slowly into the 
schoolhouse, unable to look 
around. Behind him he heard a 
confused sob, tears and a child’s 
voice trying to blubber through: 
“Something funny happened.” 

If the child had been an adult 
it might have been warning 
enough. But the child had 
never experienced possession 
before, was not sure enough, 
was clear into the schoolhouse 
before the remaining members of 
the Society of Slaves awoke to 
their danger. He heard a quick 
cry of They got him! Then 
Chandler’s legs stopped walking 
and he addressed himself sav- 
agely. A few yards away a stout 
Chinese lady was mopping the 
tiles; she looked up at him, star- 
tled, but no more startled than 
Chandler was himself. “You 
idiot!” Chandler blazed. “Why 
do you have to get mixed up 
in this? Don’t you know it’s 
wrong, love? Stay here!” Chand- 
ler commanded himself. “Don’t 
you dare leave this building!” 
And he was free again, but 
there was a sudden burst of 
screams from outside. 

Bewildered, Chandler stood 



for a moment, as little able to 
move as though the girl still had 
him under control. Then he 
leaped through a classroom to a 
window, staring. Outside in the 
playground there was wild con- 
fusion. Half the spectators were 
on the ground, trying to rise. As 
he watched, a teen-age boy 
hurled himself at an elderly lady, 
the two of them falling. Another 
man flung himself to the ground. 
A woman swung her pocketbook 
into the face of the man next to 
her. One of the fallen ones rose, 
only to trip himself again. It was 
a mad spectacle, but Chandler 
understood it: What he was 

watching was a single member 
of the exec trying to keep a group 
of twenty ordinary, unarmed hu- 
man beings in line. The exec was 
leaping from mind to mind; even 
so, the crowd was beginning to 
scatter. 

Without thought Chandler 
started to leap out to help them; 
but the possessor had anticipated 
that. He was caught at the door. 
He whirled and ran toward the 
woman with the mop; as he was 
released, the woman flung herself 
upon him, knocking him down. 

By the time he was able to get 
up again it was far too late to 
help ... if there ever had been 
a time when he could have been 
of any real help. 

He heard shots. Two police- 
man had come running into the 



168 



GALAXY 



playground, with guns drawn. 

The exec who had looked at 
him out of the boy’s eyes, who 
had penetrated this nest of en- 
emies and extricated Chandler 
from it, had taken first things 
first. Help had been summoned. 
Quick as the coronets worked, it 
was no time at all until the near- 
est persons with weapons were 
located, commandeered and in 
action. 

Two minutes later there no 
longer was resistance. 

Obviously more execs had 
come to help, attracted by the 
commotion perhaps, or summoned 
at some stolen moment after the 
meeting had first been invaded. 
There were only five survivors 
on the field. Each was clearly 
controlled. They rose and stood 
patiently while the two police 
shot them, shot them, paused to 
reload and shot again. The last 
to die was the bearded man, 
Linton, and as he fell his eyes 
brushed Chandler’s. 

Chandler leaned against a wall. 

It had been a terrible sight. 
The nearness of his own death 
had been almost the least of it. 

He had no doubt of the iden- 
tity of the exec who had saved 
him and destroyed the others. 
Though he had heard the voice 
only as it came from his own 
mouth, he could not miss it. It 
was Rosalie Pan. 

He looked out at the red-head- 



ed man, sprawled across the foul 
line behind third base, and re- 
membered what he had said. 
There weren’t any good execs or 
bad execs. There were only execs. 

XI 

"Vj^HATEVER Chandler’s life 
” might be worth, he knew he 
had given it away and the girl 
had given it back to him. 

He did not see her for several 
days, but the morning after the 
massacre he woke to find a note 
beside his bed table. No one had 
been in the room. It was his own 
sleeping hand that had written 
it, though the girl’s mind had 
moved his fingers: 

If you get mixed up in any- 
thing like that again I won’t be 
able to help you. So don’t! Those 
people are just using you, you 
know. Don’t throw away your 
chances. Do you like surfboard- 
ing? 

Rosie 

But by then there was no time 
for surfboarding, or for anything 
else but work. The construction 
job on Hilo had begun, and it 
was a nightmare. He was flown 
to the island with the last load of 
parts. No execs were present in 
the flesh, but in the first day 
Chandler lost count of how many 
different minds possessed his 
own. He began to be able to rec- 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



169 



ognize them by a limp as he 
walked, by tags of German as he 
spoke, by a stutter, a distinctive 
gesture of annoyance, an exple- 
tive. As he was a trained engineer 
he was left to labor by himself 
for hours on end. It was worse 
for the others. There seemed to 
be a dozen execs hovering invis- 
ible around all the time; no soon- 
er was a worker released by one 
than he was seized by another. 
The work progressed rapidly, but 
at the cost of utter exhaution. 
By the end of the fourth day 
Chandler had eaten only two 
meals and could not remember 
when he had slept last. He found 
himself staggering when free, and 
furious with the fatigue-clumsi- 
ness of his own body when pos- 
sessed. At sundown on the fourth 
day he found himself free for a 
moment and, incredibly, without 
work of his own to do just then, 
until someone else completed a 
job of patchwiring. He stumbled 
out into the open air and had 
time only to gaze around for a 
moment before his eyes began to 
close. This must once have been 
a lovely island. Even unkempt as 
it was, the trees were tall and 
beautiful. Beyond them a wisp 
of smoke was pale against the 
dark-blue evening sky; the breeze 
was scented . He woke and 
found he was already back in the 
building, reaching for his solder- 
ing gun. 



There came a point at which 
even the will of the execs was un- 
able to drive the flogged bodies 
farther, and then they were per- 
mitted to sleep for a few hours. 
At daybreak they were awake 
again. The sleep was not enough. 
The bodies were slow and inac- 
curate. Two of the Hawaiians, 
straining a hundred-pound com- 
ponent into place, staggered, 
slipped — and dropped it. 

Appalled, Chandler waited for 
them to kill themselves. 

But it seemed that the execs 
were tiring too. One of the Ha- 
waiians said irritably, with an ac- 
cent Chandler did not recognize: 
“That’s pau. All right, you mor- 
ons, you’ve won yourselves a 
vacation; we’ll have to fly you 
in replacements. Take the day 
off.” And incredibly all eleven of 
the haggard wrecks stumbling 
around the building were free at 
once. 

The first thought of every man 
was to eat, to relieve himself, to 
remove a shoe and ease a blis- 
tered foot — to do any of the 
things they had not been permit- 
ted to do. The second thought 
was sleep. 

Chandler dropped off at once, 
but he was overtired; he slept 
fitfully, and after an hour or two 
of turning on the hard ground sat 
up, blinking red-eyed around. He 
had been slow. The cushioned 
seats in the aircraft and cars 



170 



GALAXY 



were already taken. He stood up, 
stretched, scratched himself and 
wondered what to do next, and 
he remembered the thread of 
smoke he had seen — when? 
three nights ago? — against the 
evening sky. 

In all those hours he had not 
had time to think one obvious 
thought: There should have been 
no smoke there! The island was 
supposed to be deserted. 

He stood up, looked around to 
get his bearings, and started off 
in the direction he remembered. 

TT WAS good to own his body 

again, in poor condition as it 
was. It was delicious to be al- 
lowed to think consecutive 
thoughts. 

The chemistry of the human 
animal is such that it heals what- 
ever thrusts it may receive from 
the outside world. Short of death, 
its only incapacitating wound 
comes from itself; from the out- 
side it can survive astonishing 
blows, rise again and flourish. 
Chandler was not flourishing, but 
he had begun to rise. 

Time had been so compressed 
and blurred in the days since the 
slaughter at the Punahou School 
that he had not had time to 
grieve over the deaths of his 
briefly-met friends, or even to 
think of their quixotic plans 
against the execs. Now he began 
to wonder. 



He understood with what thrill 
of hope he had been received — 
a man like themselves, not an 
exec, whose touch was at the 
very center of the exec power. 
But how firm was that touch? 
Was there really anything he 
could do? 

It seemed not. He barely un- 
derstood the mechanics of what 
he was doing, far less the theory 
behind it. Conceivably knowing 
where this installation was he 
could somehow get back to it 
when it was completed. In theory 
it might be that there was a way 
to dispense with the headsets and 
exert power from the big board 
itself. 

A Cro-Magnard at the controls 
of a nuclear-laden jet bomber 
could destroy a city. Nothing 
stopped him. Nothing but his own 
invincible ignorance. Chandler 
was that Cro-Magnard; certainly 
power was here to grasp, but he 
had no way of knowing how to 
pick it up. 

Still — where there was life 
there was hope. He decided he 
was wasting time that would not 
come again. He had been wan- 
dering along a road that led into 
a small town, quite deserted, but 
this was no time for wandering. 
His place was back at the instal- 
lation, studying, scheming, trying 
to understand all he could. He 
began to turn, and stopped. 

“Great God,” he said softly, 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



171 



looking at what he had just seen. 
The town was deserted of life, 
but not of death. 

^^HERE were bodies every- 
where. 

They were long dead, perhaps 
years. They seemed natural and 
right as they lay there. It was 
not surprising they had escaped 
his notice at first. Little was left 
but bones and an occasional 
desiccated leathery rag that 
might have been a face. The 
clothing was faded and rotted 
away; but enough was left of the 
bodies and the clothes to make 
it clear that none of these people 
had died natural deaths. A rusted 
blade in a chest cage showed 
where a knife had pierced a 
heart; a small skull near his feet 
(with a scrap of faded blue rom- 
pers near it) was shattered. On 
a flagstone terrace a family group 
of bones lay radiating outward, 
like a rosette. Something had ex- 
ploded there and caught them all 
as they turned to flee. There was 
a woman’s face, grained like oak 
and eyeless, visible between the 
fender of a truck and a crushed- 
in wall. 

Like exhumed Pompeii, the 
tragedy was so ancient that it 
aroused only wonder. The whole 
town had been blotted out. 

The execs did not take 
chances; apparently they had 
sterilized the whole island — 



probably had sterilized all of 
them except Oahu itself, to make 
certain that their isolation was 
complete, except for the captive 
stock allowed to breed and serve 
them in and around Honolulu. 

Chandler prowled the town for 
a quarter of an hour, but one 
street was like another. The 
bodies did not seem to have been 
disturbed even by animals, but 
perhaps there were none big 
enough to show traces of such 
work. 

Something moved in a door- 
way. 

Chandler thought at once of 
the smoke he had seen, but no 
one answered his call and, though 
he searched, he could neither see 
nor hear anything alive. 

The search was a waste of 
time. It also wasted his best 
chance to study the thing he was 
building. As he returned to the 
cinder-block structure at the end 
of the airstrip he heard motors 
and looked up to see a plane 
circling in for a landing. 

He knew that he had only a 
few minutes. He spent those min- 
utes as thriftily as he could, but 
long before he could even grasp 
the circuitry of the parts he had 
not himself worked on he felt a 
touch at his mind. The plane was 
rolling to a stop. He and all of 
them hurried over to begin im- 
loading it. 

The plane was stopped with 



172 



GALAXY 



one wingtip almost touching the 
building, heading directly into it 

— convenient for unloading, but 
a foolish nuisance when it came 
time to turn it and take off again, 
Chandler’s mind thought while 
his body lugged cartons out of 
the plane. 

But he knew the answer to 
that. Takeoff would be no prob- 
lem, any more than it would for 
the other small transports at the 
far end of the strip. 

These planes were not going to 
return, ever. 

work went on, and then 
it was done, or all but, and 
Chandler knew no more about it 
than when it was begun. The 
last little bit was a careful check 
of line voltages and a balancing 
of biases. Chandler could helo 
only up to a point, and then two 
execs, working through the bod- 
ies of one of the Hawaiians and 
the pilot of a Piper Tri-Pacer 
who had flown in some last-min- 
ute test equipment — and re- 
mained as part of the labor pool 

— laboriously worked on the 
flnal tests. 

Spent, the other men flopped 
to the ground, waiting. 

They were far gone. All of 
them, Chandler as much as the 
others. But one of them rolled 
over, grinned tightly at Chand- 
ler and said, “It’s been fun. My 
name’s Bradley. I always think 



people ought to know each 
other’s names in cases like this. 
Imagine sharing a grave with 
some utter stranger!” 

“Grave?” 

Bradley nodded. “Like Pha- 
raoh’s slaves. The pyramid is just 
about finished, friend. You don’t 
know what I’m talking about?” 
He sat up, plucked a blade of 
stemmy grass and put it between 
his teeth. “I guess you haven’t 
seen the corpses in the woods.” 
Chandler said, “I found a town 
half a mile or so over there, noth- 
ing in it but skeletons.” 

“No, heavens, nothing that an- 
cient. These are nice fresh corp- 
ses, out behind the junkheap 
there. Well, not fresh. They’re a 
couple of weeks old. I thought it 
was neat of the execs to dispose 
of the used-up labor out of sight 
of the rest of us. So much better 
for morale . until Juan Simoa 
and I went back looking for a 
plain, simple electrical extension 
cord and found them.” 

With icy calm Chandler real- 
ized that the man was talking 
sense. Used-up labor: the men 
who had unloaded the first 
planes, no doubt — worked until 
they dropped, then efficiently dis- 
posed of, as they were so cheap 
a commodity that they were not 
worth the trouble of hauling back 
to Honolulu for salvage. “I see,” 
he said. ‘‘Besides, dead men tell 
no tales.”

"And spread no disease. Prob- 
ably that’s why they did their 
killing back in the tall trees. Al- 
ways the chance some exec might 
have to come down here to in- 
spect in person. Rotting corpses 
just aren’t sanitary.” Bradley 
grinned again. “I used to be a 
doctor at Molokai.” 

“Lep — ” began Chandler, but 
the doctor shook his head. 

“No, no, never say ‘leprosy.’ 
It’s ‘Hansen’s disease.’ Whatever 
it is, the execs were sure scared 
of it. They wiped out every pa- 
tient we had, except a couple who 
got away by swimming; then for 
good measure they wiped out 
most of the medical staff too, ex- 
cept for a couple like me who 
were off-island and had the sense 
to keep quiet about where they’d 
worked. I used,” he said, rolling 
over his back and putting his 
hands behind his head, “in the 
old days to work on pest-control 
for the Public Health Service. 
We sure knocked off a lot of rats 
and fleas. I never thought I’d be 
one of them.” He was silent 

Chandler admired his courage 
very much. The man had fallen 
asleep. 

Chandler looked at the others. 
“You going to Jet them kill us 
without a struggle?” he demand- 
ed. 

The remaining Hawaiian was 
the only one to answer. He said, 
“You just don’t know how much 



pilikia you’re in. It isn’t what we 
let them do.” 

“We’ll see,” Chandler promised 
grimly. “They’re only human. I 
haven’t given up yet.’.’ 

OUT in the end he could not 
save himself; it was the girl 
who saved him. That night 
Chandler tossed in troubled sleep, 
and woke to find himself stand- 
ing, walking toward the Tri- 
Pacer. The sun was just begin- 
ning to pink the sky and no one 
else was moving. “Sorry, love,” 
he apologized to himself. “You 
probably need to bathe and 
shave, but I don’t know how. 
Shave, I mean.” He giggled. “Any- 
way, you’ll find everything you 
need at my house.” 

He climbed into the plane. 
“Ever fly before?” he asked him- 
self. “Well, you’ll love it. Here 
we go. Close the door . snap 
the belt . turn the switch.” He 
admired the practiced ease with 
which his body started the mo- 
tor, raced it with a critical eye 
on the instruments, turned the 
plane and lifted it off, up, into 
the rising sun. 

“Oh, dear. You do need a 
bath,” he told himself, wrinkling 
his nose humorously. “No harm. 
I’ve the nicest tub — pink, deep 
— and nine kinds of bath salts. 
But I wish you weren’t so tired, 
love, because it’s a long flight 
and you’re wearing me out.” He 



174

was silent as he bent to the cor- 
rect compass heading and 
cranked a handle over his head 
to adjust the trim. “Koitska’s 
going to be so huhu’* he said, 
smiling. “Never fear, love, I can 
calm him down. But it’s easier 
to do with you in one piece, you 
know, the other way’s too late.” 

He was silent for a long time, 
and then his voice began to sing. 

They were songs from Rosa- 
lie’s own musical comedies. Even 
with so poor an instrument as 
Chandler’s voice to work with, 
she sang well enough to keep 
both of them entertained while 
his body brought the plane in for 
a landing; and so Chandler went 
to live in the villa that belonged 
to Rosalie Pan. 

XII 

66T OVE,” she said, “there are 
worse things in the world 
than keeping me amused when 
I’m not busy. We’ll go to the 
beach again one day soon, I 
promise.” And she was gone 
again. 

Chandler was a concubine — 
not even that; he was a male 
geisha, convenient to play gin 
rummy with, or for company on 
the surfboards, or to make a 
drink. 

He did not quite know what to 
make of himself. In bad times 



one hopes for survival. He had 
hoped; and now he had survival, 
perfumed and cushioned, but on 
what mad terms! Rosalie was a 
pretty girl, and a good-humored 
one. She was right. There were 
worse things in the world than 
being her companion; but Chand- 
ler could not adjust himself to 
the role. 

It angered him when she got 
up from the garden swing and 
locked herself in her room — for 
he knew that she was not sleep- 
ing as she lay there, though her 
eyes were closed and she was 
motionless. It infuriated him 
when she casually usurped his 
body to bring an ashtray to her 
side, or to stop him when his 
hands presumed. And it drove 
him nearly wild to be a puppet 
with her friends working his 
strings. 

He was that most of all. One 
exec who wished to communi- 
cate with another cast about for 
an available human proxy near- 
by. Chandler was that for Rosie 
Pan: her telephone, her social 
secretary, and on occasion he was 
the garment her dates put on. 
For Rosalie was one of the few 
execs who cared to conduct any 
major part of her life in her own 
skin. She liked dancing. She en- 
joyed dining out. It was her 
pleasure to display herself to the 
worshippers at Luigi the Wharf 
Rat’s and to speed down the long 



PLAGUE OF PYTHONS 



175 



combers on a surfboard. When 
another exec chose to accompany 
her it was Chandler’s body which 
gave the remote “date” flesh. 

He ate very well indeed — in 
surprising variety. He drank 
heavily sometimes and abstained 
others. Once, in the person of a 
Moroccan exec, he smoked an 
opium pipe; once he dined on 
roasted puppy. He saw many in- 
teresting things and, when Ros- 
alie was occupied without him, 
he had the run of her house, her 
music library, her pantry and her 
books. He was not mistreated. He 
was pampered and praised, and 
every night she kissed him before 
she retired to her own room with 
the snap-lock on the door. 

He was miserable. 

He prowled the house in the 
nights after she had left him, un- 
able to sleep. It had been bad 
enough on Hilo, under the hang- 
ing threat of death. But then, 
though he was only a slave, he 
was working at something that 
used his skill and training. 

Now? Now a Pekingese could 
do nearly all she wanted of him. 
He despised in himself the 
knowledge that with a Pekin- 
gese’s cunning he was contriving 
to make himself indispensable to 
her — her slippers fetched in his 
teeth, his silky mane by her hand 
to stroke — if not these things in 
actuality, then their very near 
equivalents. 



But what else was there for 
him? 

There was nothing. She had 
spared his life from Koitska, and 
if he offended her Koitska’s sen- 
tence would be carried out. 

Even dying might be better 
than this, he thought. 

Indeed, it might be better even 
to go back to Honolulu and life. 

TN THE morning he woke to 
find himself climbing the 
wide, carpeted steps to her room. 
She was not asleep; it was her 
mind that was guiding him. 

He opened the door. She lay 
with a feathery coverlet pulled 
up to her chin, eyes open, head 
propped on three pillows; as she 
looked at him he was free. “Some- 
thing the matter, love? You fell 
asleep sitting up.” 

“Sorry.” She would not be put 
off. She made him tell her his 
resentments. She was very under- 
standing and very sure as she 
said, “You’re not a dog, love. I 
won’t have you thinking that 
way. You’re my friend. Don’t you 
think I need a friend?” She 
leaned forward. Her nightgown 
was very sheer; but Chandler 
had tasted that trap before and 
he averted his eyes. “You think 
it’s all fun for us. I understand. 
Tell me, if you thought I was 
doing important work — oh, 
crucial work, love — would you 
feel a little easier? Because I am.

We’ve got the whole work of 
the island to do, and I do my 
share. We’ve got our plans to 
make and our future to provide 
for. There are so few of us. A 
single H-bomb could kill us all. 
Do you think it isn’t work, keep- 
ing that bomb from ever coming 
here? There’s all Honolulu to 
monitor, for they know about 
us there. We can’t like some dis- 
gusting nitwits like your Society 
of Slaves destroy us. There’s the 
problems of the world to see to. 
Why,” she said with pride, “we’ve 
solved the whole Indian-Pakistani 
population problem in the last 
two months. They’ll not have to 
worry about famine again for a 
dozen generations! We’re work- 
ing on China now; next Japan; 
next — oh, all the world. We’ll 
have three-quarters of the lumps 
gone soon, and the rest will have 
space to breathe in. It’s work!” 
She saw his expression and 
said earnestly, “No, don’t think 
that! You call it murder. It is, of 
course. But it’s the surgeon’s 
knife. We’re quicker and less 
painful than starvation, love . 
and if some of us enjoy the work 
of weeding out the unfit, does 
that change anything? It does 
not! I admit some of us are, well, 
mean. But not all. And we’re im- 
proving. The new people we take 
in are better than the old.” 

She looked at him thought- 
fully for a moment. 



Then she shook her head. 
“Never mind,” she said — ap- 
parently to herself. “Forget it, 
love. Go like an angel and fetch 
us both some coffee.” 

T IKE AN angel he went . 
^ not, he thought bitterly, like 
a man. 

She was keeping something 
from him, and he was too stub- 
born to let her tease him out of 
his mood. “Everything’s a secret,” 
he complained, and she patted 
his cheek. 

“It has to be that way.” She 
was quite serious. “This is the 
biggest thing in the world. I’m 
fond of you, love, but I can’t let 
that interfere with my duty.” 

“Shto, Rosie?" said Chandler’s 
mouth thickly. 

“Oh, there you are, Andrei,” 
she said, and spoke quickly in 
Russian. 

Chandler’s brows knotted in a 
scowl and he barked: “Nyeh 
mozhet bit!” 

“Andrei . .” she said gently. 
“Fa vas sprashnivayoo . .” 

''Nyei!" 

“No Andrei . .” 

Rumble, grumble; Chandler’s 
body twitched and fumed. He 
heard his own name in the argu- 
ment, but w’hat the subject mat- 
ter was he could not tell. Rosalie 
was coaxing; Koitska was refus- 
ing. But he was weakening. After 
minutes Chandler’s shoulders

shrugged; he nodded; and he was 
free. 

‘‘Have some more coffee, love,” 
said Rosalie Pan with an air of 
triumph. 

Chandler waited. He did not 
understand what was going on. 
It was up to her to enlighten 
him, and finally she smiled and 
said: “Perhaps you can join us, 
love. Don’t say yes or no. It isn’t 
up to you . and besides you 
can’t know whether you want it 
or not until you try. So be pa- 
tient a moment.” 

Chandler frowned; then felt 
his body taken. His lips barked: 
“Khorashaw!” His body got up 
and walked to the wall of Rosa- 
lie’s room. A picture on the wall 
moved aside and there was a 
safe. Flick, flick, Chandler’s own 
fingers dialed a combination so 
rapidly that he could not follow 
it. The door of the safe opened. 

And Chandler was free, and 
Rosalie excitedly leaping out of 
the bed behind him, careless of 
the wisp of nylon that was her 
only garment, crowding softly, 
warmly past him to reach inside 
the safe. She lifted out a coronet 
very like her own. 

She paused and looked at 
Chandler. 

“You can’t do anything to 
harm us with this one, love,” she 
warned. “Do you understand 
that? I mean, don’t get the idea 
that you can tell anyone any- 



thing. Or do something violent. 
You can’t I’ll be right with you, 
and Koitska will be monitoring 
the transmitter.” She handed him 
the coronet. “Now, when you see 
something interesting, you move 
right in. You’ll see how. It’s the 
easiest thing in the world, and 
— Oh, here. Put it on.” 

Chandler swallowed with diffi- 
culty. 

She was offering him the tool 
that had given the execs the 
world. A blunter, weaker tool 
than her own, no doubt. But still 
it was power beyond his imagin- 
ing. He stood there frozen as she 
slipped it on his head. Sprung 
electrodes pressed gently against 
his temples and behind his ears. 
She touched something . 

Chandler stood motionless for 
a moment and then, without 
effort, floated free of his own 
body. 

Tj^LOATING. Floating; a jelly- 
■*- fish floating. Trailing ten- 
tacles that whipped and curled, 
floating over the sandbound 
claws and chitin that clashed 
beneath, floating over the world’s 
people, and them not even know- 
ing, not even seeing . 

Chandler floated. 

He was up, out and away. He 
was drifting. Around him was 
no-color. He saw nothing of space 
or size, he only saw, or did not 
see but felt-smelled-tasted, peo-

pie. They were the sandbound. 
They were the creatures that 
crawled and struggled below, and 
his tentacles lashed out at them. 

Beside him floated another. 
The girl? It had a shape, but not 
a human shape — a pair of great 
projecting spheres, a cinctured 
area-rule shape. Female. Yes, un- 
doubtedly the girl. It waved a 
member at him and he under- 
stood he was beckoned. He fol- 
lowed. 

Two of sandbound ones were 
ahead. 

The female shape slipped into 
one, he into the other. It was as 
easy to invest this form with his 
own will as it was to command 
the muscles of his hand. They 
looked at each other out of sand- 
bound eyes. “You’re a boy!” 
Chandler laughed. The girl 
laughed: “You’re an old washer- 
woman!” They were in a kitchen 
where fish simmered on an elec- 
tric stove. The boy-Rosie wrin- 
kled his-her nose, blinked and 
was empty. Only the small 
almond-eyed boy was left, and 
he began to cry convulsively. 
Chandler understood. He floated 
out after her. 

This way, this way, she ges- 
tured. A crowd of mudbound 
figures. She slipped into one, he 
into another. They were in a bus 
now, rocking along an inland 
road, all men, all roughly dressed. 
Laborers going to clear a new 



section of Oahu of its split-level 
debris. Chandler thought, and 
looked for the girl in one of the 
men’s eyes, could not find her, 
hesitated and — floated. She was 
hovering impatiently. This way! 

He followed, and followed. 

They were a hundred people 
doing a hundred things. They 
lingered a few moments as a 
teen-age couple holding hands in 
the twilight of the beach. They 
fled from a room where Chand- 
ler was an old woman dying on 
a bed, and Rosalie a stolid, un- 
caring nurse beside her. They 
played follow-the-leader through 
the audience of a Honolulu mov- 
ie theater, and sought each other, 
laughing, among the fish stalls of 
King Street. Then Chandler 
turned to Rosalie to speak and 
... it all went out . the scene 
disappeared ... he opened his 
eyes, and he was back in his own 
flesh. 

He was lying on the pastel pile 
rug in Rosalie’s bedroom. 

He got up, rubbing the side of 
his face. He had tumbled, it 
seemed. Rosalie was lying on the 
bed. 

In a moment she ojtened her 
eyes. 

“Well, love?” 

He said hoarsely, “What made 
it stop?” 

She shrugged. “Koitska turned 
you off. Tired of monitoring us, 
I expect — it’s been an hour. I’m

surprised his patience lasted this 
long.” 

She stretched luxuriously, but 
he was too full of what had hap> 
pened even to see the white 
grace of her body. “Did you like 
it, love? Would you like to have 
it forever?” 

XIII 

rOR NINE days Chandler’s 
status remained in limbo. He 
spent that day in a state of numb 
bemusement, remembering the 
men and women he had worn 
like garments, appalled and ex- 
hilarated. He did not see Rosalie 
again that day, she kept to her 
room and he locked out. He was 
still a lapdog, but a lapdog with 
a dream dangling before him. He 
went to sleep that night thinking 
that he was a dog who might be- 
come a god, and he had eight 
days left. 

The next day Rosalie whee- 
dled another hour of the coro- 
net from Koitska. They explored 
the ice caves on Mount Rainier 
in the bodies of two sick, starving 
hermits and wandered arm in 
arm near the destroyed Interna- 
tional Bridge at Niagara, breath- 
ing the spray of the unchanging 
Falls. He had seven days left. 

They passed like a dream. He 
saw a great deal of the inner 
workings of the exec, more than 
before. He had privileges. He was 



up for membership in the club. 
Rosalie had proposed him. He 
talked with two Czechoslovakian 
ballet dancers in their persons, 
and a succession of heavily ac- 
cented Russians and Poles and 
Japanese through the mouth of 
the beach boy who came to tend 
Rosalie’s garden. He thought 
they liked him and was pleased 
that he penetrated where he had 
not been allowed before . until 
he realized that these freedoms 
were in themselves a threat. 
They allowed him this contact so 
that they could look him over. If 
they rejected him they would 
have to kill him, because he had 
seen too much. But by then a 
week had passed, and another 
day, and though he did not know 
it he had only one day left. 
Rosalie did what she could to 
make the days of waiting easy 
for him. 

“Embarrassing, isn’t it? I went 
through it myself, love. Come 
have a drink.” 

“When will I know?” he de- 
manded fretfully. 

“Well.” She hesitated. “I don’t 
suppose there’s any harm in tell- 
ing you, love, under the circum- 
stances — ” 

He knew what the circum- 
stances were. 

“I guess I can tell you. You 
need just over seven hundred 
votes to come in. You’ve got — ” 
Her eyes glazed for a moment.

She was looking through some 
clerk’s eyes, somewhere on the 
island. “You’ve got about a hun- 
dred and fifty so far. Takes time, 
doesn’t it? But it’s worth it in 
the end.” 

“How many ‘no’ votes?” 
‘None.” She said gently, “You’ll 
never have but one, love, because 
that’s all it takes.” 

He stared. The girl gook took 
up his hand and kissed it lightly. 
“One blackball’s enough, yes, but 
never fear. Rosie’s on your side.” 

"OESTLESSLY Chandler stood 
up and made himself an- 
other drink. His head was begin- 
ning to buzz. They had been 
drinking on her sun terrace since 
early afternoon. 

Rosalie came up beside him 
soothingly. “I know how you 
feel. Want me to tell you about 
when I went through it?” 

“Sure,” he said, stirring the ice 
around in the glass and drinking 
it down. He made another drink 
absently, hardly hearing what 
she said, although the sound of 
her voice was welcome. 

“Oh, that lousy headdress! It 
weighed twenty pounds, and 
they put it on with hatpins.” He 
caressed her absently. He had 
figured out that she was talking 
about the night New York was 
bombed. “I was in the middle of 
the big first-act curtain number 
when — ” her face was strained. 



even after years, even now that 
she was herself one of the god- 
like ones — “when something 
took hold of me. I ran off the 
stage and right out through the 
front door. There was a cab wait- 
ing. As soon as I got in I was 
free, and the driver took off like 
a lunatic through the tunnel, out 
to Newark Airport. I tell you, I 
was scared! At the toll booth I 
screamed but my — friend — let 
go of the driver for a minute, 
smashed a trailer-truck into a 
police car, and in the confusion 
we got away. He took me over 
again at the airport. I ran bare 
as a bird into a plane that was 
just ready to take off. The pilot 
was under control . We flew 
eleven hours, and I wore that 
damn feather headdress all the 
way.” 

She held out her glass for a re- 
fill. Chandler busied himself slic- 
ing a lime for her drink. Now 
she was talking about her friend. 
“I hadn’t seen him in six years. 
I was just a kid, living in Islip. 
He was with a Russian trade 
commission next door, in an old 
mansion. Well, he was one of the 
ones, back in Russia, that came 
up with these.” She touched her 
coronet. “So,” she said brightly, 
“he put me up for membership 
and by and by they gave me one. 
You see? It’s all very simple, ex- 
cept the waiting.” 

Chandler pulled her down on 



182 



GALAXY 



the couch beside him and made 
a toast. “Your friend.” 

“He’s a nice guy,” she said 
moodily, sipping her drink. “You 
know how careful I am about 
getting exercise and so on? It’s 
partly because of him. You 
would have liked him, love, only 
— well, it turned out that he 
liked me well enough, but he be- 
gan to like what he could get 
through the coronet a lot more. 
He got fat. A lot of them are 
awfully fat, love,” she said seri- 
ously. “That’s why they need 
people like me. And you. Re- 
placements. Heart trouble, liver 
trouble, what can they expect 
when they lie in bed day in and 
day out, taking their lives 
through other people’s bodies? I 
won’t let myself go that way . 
It’s a temptation. You know, al- 
most every day I find some poor 
woman on a diet and spend a 
solid hour eating creampuffs and 
gravies. How they must hate 
me!” 

She grinned, leaned back and 
kissed him. 

Chandler put his arms around 
the girl and returned the kiss, 
hard. She did not draw away. She 
clung to him, and he could feel 
in the warmth of her body, the 
sound of her breath that she was 
responding. The drink made him 
reckless; the last two weeks 
made him doubtful; he was torn. 
He could tell that there was no 



resistance in her body, but the 
coronet made it in doubt; she 
could fling him away from her 
with one touch of the mind. Yet 
she didn’t do it — 

“Vi myenya zvali?” his own 
voice demanded, harsh and 
mocking. 

^^HE GIRL tried to push him 
away. Her eyes were bright 
and huge, staring at him. 
“Andrei!” 

“Da, Andrei! Kok eto dosad- 

nor 

“Andrei, please. I know that 
you are — ” 

“Filthy!” screamed Chandler’s 
voice. “How can you? I do not al- 
low this carrion to touch you so 
— not vot is mine — I do not 
allow him to live!” And Chandler 
dropped her and leaped to his 
feet. He fought. He struggled; 
but only in his mind, and help- 
lessly; his body carried him out 
of the room, running and stum- 
bling, out into the drive, into her 
waiting car and away. 

He drove like a madman on 
roads he had never seen before. 
The car’s gears bellowed pain at 
their abuse, the tires screamed. 

Chandler, prisoned inside him- 
self, recognized that touch. Koit- 
ska! He knew who Rosalie Pan’s 
lover had been. If he had been in 
doubt his own voice, raucous and 
hysterical with rage, told him the 
truth. All that long drive it

screamed threats and obscenities 
at him, in Russian and tortured 
English. 

The car stopped in front of the 
TWA facility and, still prisoned, 
his body hurried in, bruising it- 
self deliberately against every 
doorpost and stick of furniture. 
“I could have smashed you in the 
car!” his voice screamed hoarsely. 
“It is too merciful. I could have 
thrown you into the sea! It is not 
painful enough.” 

In the garage his body stopped 
and looked wildly around. 
“Knives, torches,” his lips 
chanted. “Shall I gouge out 
eyes? Slit throat?” 

A jar of battery acid stood on 
a shelf, “Da, da!” screamed 
Chandler, stumbling toward it. 
“One drink eh? And I von’t even 
stay vith you to feel it, the pain 
— just a moment — then it eats 
the gut, the long slow dying . 
And all the time the body that 
was Chandler’s was clawing the 
cap off the jar, tilting it — 

He dropped the jar, and 
leaped aside instinctively as it 
splintered at his feet. 

He was free! 

Before he could move he was 
seized again, stumbled, crashed 
into a wall — 

And was free again. 

He stood waiting for a mo- 
ment, unable to believe it; but 
he was still free. The alien in- 
vader did not seize his mind. 



There was no sound. No one 
moved. No gun fired at him, no 
danger threatened. 

He was free; he took a step, 
turned, shook his head and 
proved it. 

He was free and, in a moment, 
realized that he was in the build- 
ing with the fat bloated body of 
the man who wanted to murder 
him, the body that in its own 
strength could scarcely stand 
erect. 

It was suicide to attempt to 
harm an exec. He would certain- 
ly lose his life — except — that 
was gone already anyhow; he 
had lost it. He had nothing left 
to lose.

^HANDLER loped silently up 
^ the stairs to Koitska’s suite. 

Halfway up he tripped and 
sprawled, half stunning himself 
against the stair rail. It had not 
been his own clumsiness, he was 
sure. Koitska had caught at his 
mind again, but only feebly. 
Chandler did not wait. Whatever 
was interfering with Koitska’s 
control, some distraction or mal- 
function of the coronet or what- 
ever, Chandler could not bank on 
its lasting. 

The door was locked. 

He found a heavy mahogany 
chair, with a back of solid carved 
wood. He flung it onto his shoul-

ders, grunting, and ran with it 
into the door, a bull driven fran- 
tic, lunging out of its querencia 
to batter the wall of the arena. 
The door splintered. 

Chandler was gashed with long 
slivers of wood, but he was 
through the door. 

Koitska lay sprawled along his 
couch, eyes staring. 

Alive or dead? Chandler did 
not wait to find out but sprang 
at him hands outstreched. The 
staring eyes flickered; Chandler 
felt the pull at his mind. But 
Koitska’s strength was almost 
gone. The eyes glazed, and 
Chandler was upon him. He 
ripped the coronet off and flung 
it aside, and the huge bulk of 
Koitska swung paralytically ofl 
the couch and fell to the floor. 

The man was helpless. He lay 
breathing like a steam engine, 
one eye pressed shut against the 
leg of a coffee table, the other 
looking up at Chandler. 

Chandler was panting almost 
as hard as the helpless mass at 
his feet. He was safe for a mo- 
ment. At the most for a moment, 
for at any time one of the other 
execs might dart down out of the 
mind-world into the real, looking 
at the scene through Chandler’s 
eyes and surely deducing what 
would be no more to his favor 
than the truth. He had to get 
away from there. If he seemed 
busy in another room perhaps 



they would go away again. 
Chandler turned his back on the 
paralyzed monster to flee. It 
would be even better to try to 
lose himself in Honolulu — if he 
could get that far — he did not 
in his own flesh know how to fly 
the helicopter that was parked in 
the yard or he would try to get 
farther still. 

But as he turned he was 
caught. 

^HANDLER turned to see 
^ Koitska lying there, and 
screamed. 

His eyes were staring at Koit- 
ska. It was too late. He was pos- 
sessed by someone, he did not 
know whom. Though it made 
little enough difference, he 
thought, watching his own hands 
reach out to touch the staring 
face. 

His body straightened, his 
eyes looked around the room, he 
went to the desk. “Love,” he 
cried to himself, “what’s the mat- 
ter with Koitska? Write, for 
God’s sake!” And he took a pen- 
cil in his hand and was free. 

He hesitated, then scribbled: 
I don't know. I think he had a 
stroke. Who are you? 

The other mind slipped tenta- 
tively into his, scanning the pa- 
per. “Rosie, you idiot, who did 
you think?” he said furiously. 
“What have you done?” 

Nothing, he began instinctive-

ly, then scratched the word out. 
Briskly and exactly he wrote: 
He was going to kill me, but he 
had some kind of an attack. / 
took his coronet away. I was go- 
ing to run. 

“Oh, you fool,” he told himself 
shrilly a moment later. Chand- 
ler’s body knelt beside the wheez- 
ing fat lump, taking its pulse. 
The faint, fitful throb meant 
nothing to Chandler; probably 
meant nothing to Rosie either, 
for his body stood up, hesitated, 
shook its head. “You’ve done it 
now,” he sobbed, and was sur- 
prised to find he was weeping 
real tears. “Oh, love, why? I 
could have taken care of Koitska 
— somehow — No, maybe I 
couldn’t,” he said frantically, 
breaking down. “I don’t know 
what to do. Do you have any 
ideas — outside of running?” 

It took him several seconds to 
write the one word, but it was 
really all he could find to write. 
No. 

His lips twisted as his eyes 
read the word. “Well,” he said 
practically, “I guess that’s the 
end, love. I mean, I give up.” 

He got up, turned around the 
room. “I don’t know,” he told 
himself worriedly. “There might 
be a chance — if we could hush 
this up. I’d better get a doctor. 
He’ll have to use your body, so 
don’t be surprised if there’s some- 
one and it isn’t me. Maybe he 



can pull Andrei through. Maybe 
Andrei’ll forgive you then — Or 
if he dies,” Chandler’s voice 
schemed as his eyes stared at the 
rasping motionless hulk, “we can 
say you broke down the door to 
help him. Only you’ll have to put 
his coronet back on, so it won’t 
look suspicious. Besides that will 
keep anyone from occupying 
him. Do that, love. Hurry.” And 
he was free. 

Gingerly Chandler crossed the 
floor. 

He did not like to touch the 
dying animal that wheezed be- 
fore him, liked even less to give 
it back the weapon that, if it had 
only a few moments of sentience 
again, it would use to kill him. 
But the girl was right. Without 
the helmet any wandering curi- 
himself. The helmet would shield 
him from — 

Would shield anyone from — 

Would shield Chandler him- 
self from possession if he used it! 

He did not hesitate. He slipped 
the helmet on his head, snapped 
the switch and in a moment stood 
free of his own body, in the gray, 
luminous limbo, looking down at 
the pallid traceries that lay be- 
neath. 



TTE DID NOT hesitate then 
either. 

He did not pause to think or 
plan; it was as though he had 
planned every step, in long detail.

over many years. Chandler for at 
least a few moments had the 
freedom to battle the execs on 
their own ground, the freedom 
that any mourning parent or hus- 
band in the outside world would 
know well how to use. 

Chandler also knew. He was a 
weapon. He might die — but it 
was not a great thing to die, mil- 
lions had done it for nothing 
under the rule of the execs, and 
he was privileged to be able to 
die trying to kill them. 

He stepped callously around 
the hulk on the floor and found 
a door behind the couch, a door 
and a hall, and at the end of that 
hall a large room that had once 
perhaps been a message center. 
Now it held rack after rack of 
electronic gear. He recognized it 
without elation. It had had to be 
there. 

It was the main transmitter for 
all the coronets of the exec. 

He had only to pull one switch 
— that one there — and power 
would cease to flow. The coro- 
nets would be dead. The execs 
would be only humans. In five 
minutes he could destroy enough 
parts so that it would be at least 
a week’s work to build it again, 
and in a week the slaves in Hon- 
olulu — somehow he could reach 
them, somehow he would tell 
them of their chance — could 
root out and destroy every exec 
on all the islands. 



Of course, there was the stand- 
by transmitter he himself had 
helped to build. 

He realized tardily that Koit- 
ska would have made some ar- 
rangement for starting that up 
by remote control. 

He put down the tool-kit with 
which he had been advancing on 
the racks of transistors, and 
paused to think. 

He was a fool, he saw after a 
moment. He could not destroy 
this installation — not yet — 
not until he had used it. He re- 
membered to sit down so that 
his body would not crash to the 
floor, and then he sent himself 
out and up, to scan the nearby 
area. 

There was no one there, no- 
body within a mile or more, ex- 
cept the feeble glimmer that was 
dying Koitska. He did not enter 
that body. He returned to his 
own long enough to barricade the 
door — it had a strong-looking 
lock, but he shouldered furniture 
against it too — and then he 
went up and out, grateful to 
Rosalie, who had taught him how 
to navigate in the curious world 
of the mind, flashing across wa- 
ter, under a mind-controlled 
plane, to the island of Hilo. 

There had to be someone near 
the stand-by installation. 

He searched; but there was no 
one. No one in the building. No 
one near the ruined field. No one

in the village of the dead nearby. 
He was desperate; he became 
frantic; he was on the point of 
giving up, and then he found — 
someone? But it was a personal* 
ity feebler than stricken Koit- 
ska’s, a bare swamphre glow. 

No matter. He entered it. 

A T ONCE he screamed silently 
and left it again. He had 
never known such pain. A terrify- 
ing fire in the belly, a thunder 
past any migraine in the head, 
a thousand lesser aches and woes 
in every member. He could not 
imagine what person lived in such 
distress; but grimly he forced 
himself to enter again. 

Moaning — it was astonishing 
how thick and animal-like the 
man’s voice was — Chandler 
forced his borrowed body stumb- 
ling through the jungle. Time was 
growing very short. He drove it 
gasping at an awkward run across 
the airfield, dodged around one 
wrecked plane and blundered 
through the door. The pain was 
intolerable. He was hardly able 
to maintain control. 

Chandler stretched out the 
borrowed hand to pick up a 
heavy wrench even while he 
thought. But the hand would not 
grasp. He brought it to the weak, 
watering eyes. The hand had no 
fingers. It ended in a ball of scar 
tissue. The left hand was nearly 
as misshapen. 

Panicked, Chandler retreated 



from the body in a flash, back to 
his own; and then he began to 
think. 

It was, it had to be, the crea- 
ture he had seen in the village of 
the dead. A lep>er. One of the few 
who escaped from the colony at 
Molokai. Chandler drove himself 
back to that body and, though it 
could not work well, he could 
make it turn a frequency dial, 
using its clubbed hands like 
sticks. He could make it throw a 
switch. He then caused it to place 
the toothed edge of a rusting saw 
on the ground and strike at it 
with its throat in a sort of reverse 
guillotine. Chandler could not see 
that he had a choice; he dared 
not have that creature left where 
it might be seized the moment he 
quit its body. It was better dead. 

After that it all became easy. 

In his own body he destroyed 
the installation in Oahu. A few 
minutes at Koitska’s work bench, 
and he had changed the frequen- 
cy on his own coronet to transmit 
on the new band the leper’s touch 
had given the Hilo equipment. 

He worked rapidly and with- 
out errors, one ear cocked for the 
sound of someone coming to 
threaten what he was doing (the 
sound never came), impatient to 
get the job done. 

He was very impatient, for 
when he was done he would be 
the only exec. 

And the execs would be only 
slaves.

/"^HANDLER strolled out of the 
^ TWA building, very tired. 

It was dawn. His job was done. 
He carried the coronet, the only 
working coronet in the world, in 
his hand. He had spent the night 
killing, killing, killing, and blood 
had washed away his passions; he 
was spent. He had killed every 
exec he could find, in widening 
circles from the building where 
his body lay. He had slit his 
dozen throats and fired bullets 
into his hundred hearts and hun- 
dred brains; he had entered 
bodies only long enough to feel 
for a coronet, and if it was there 
the body was doomed; and he 
stopped only when it occurred to 
him he wasn’t even doing that 
much any more. He had prob- 
ably killed some dozens of 
slaves, as well as all the execs in 
reach. And when he stopped the 
orgy of killing he had made one 
last search of the nearer portions 
of the island and found no one 
alive, and he had then realized 
that one of the closest execs had 
been Rosalie Pan. 

He knew that in a while he 
would feel very badly for having 
killed that girl (which could she 
have been? The one with the 
shotgun in the mouth? The one 
whose intestines he had spilled 
with a silver letteropener in a 
whim of hara-kiri?), but just now 
he was too worn. 



He was Chandler the giant 
killer, who had destroyed the 
creatures who had destroyed a 
world, but he was all tired out. 
He poked at the filigree of the 
coronet absently, as a man might 
caress the pretty rug which once 
had been the skin of a tiger that 
almost killed him. It was all that 
was left of the exec power. Who 
held this single coronet still held 
the world. 

Of course, said a sly and trea- 
sonable voice in a corner of his 
mind, the job was not really done. 

Not quite. Not all. 

The job would not be done 
until it was impossible for any- 
one to find enough of the instal- 
lations to be able to reconstruct 
them. 

And then, said the voice, while 
Chandler stared at the dawn, lis- 
tening, what about the good 
things the exec had done? 
Would he not be foolish to throw 
away so casually this one, unique 
chance to right every imaginable 
wrong the world might do him? 

Chandler went back into the 
building and brewed some strong 
black coffee. While it was bubbl- 
ing on the stove he slipped the 
coronet back atop his head. Only 
for a while, he promised. A very 
little while. He pledged himself 
solemnly that it would be just 
long enough to clean up all loose 
ends — not a moment longer, he 
pledged. And knew that he was 
lying. — FREDERIK POHL

5 Star Shelf 



AN ASSUMPTION can seem 
like fact merely by con- 
stant repetition. That this is star- 
tlingly true has been demon- 
strated by Isaac Asimov in his 
latest book, the title of which 
supplies the finest three-word de- 
scription of science fiction that I 
have yet seen and just barely 
lacks the snappy oomph that 
would entice a prospective mag 
publisher to gobble it up as the 
title of a new SF entry. 

Fact and Fancy by Asimov, 
under Doubleday’s imprint, is a 
collection of speculative essays. 



mainly from FiiSF, that repre- 
sent his closest approach to the 
fictional sphere since he took up 
science popularization in earnest. 

Asimov has clearly had keen 
enjoyment from taking certain 
stock assumptions from the rep- 
ertoire of the SF hack writer and 
subjecting them to keen scrutiny 
under the pitiless light of present 
scientific knowledge. 

For example, one of the most 
glamorous settings used for years 
has been, “The Planet of the 
Double Sun.” How many stories 
have you and I read with this 



190 



GALAXY 



background? Now along comes 
Spoilsport Asimov and proceeds 
to knock this exotic picture out 
of our heads with hard facts. He 
takes as example Alpha Centauri 
A, which is Earth’s twin in tem- 
perature, brightness and mass, 
and which actually is the major 
partner in an existing binary sys- 
tem. In terms of our solar system, 
Alpha Centauri B, the minor 
partner, revolves in the orbit of 
Uranus, two billion miles out, so 
that even Saturn would be near- 
er to A than to B. And since A 
has eight times the gravitational 
attraction of B, no trouble should 
arise from that score. Since the 
diameter of B is 430,000 miles, 
this would seem to provide the 
Double Sun of the old-fashioned 
SF tale. 

But would B appear like an- 
other sun? It would not! Asimov 
does the arithmetic and finds that 
a diameter of 430,000 miles at a 
distance of two billion miles sub- 
tends an angle of 45 seconds of 
arc. To the naked eye. Sun B 
would be just about the appar- 
ent size of Jupiter! The one small 
feature redeemed from this rude 
shattering of one of my favorite 
boyhood illusions is the fact that 
Sun B would be 150 times as 
bright as the full moon. But this 
is still only l/3000th as bright 
as Sun A. 

Q. How close would a star the 
size of our sun have to be to be 



seen as a disk? A. Not more 
than a billion miles. Considering 
that, even at the center of our 
galaxy, star distances average one 
light year, the possibility of dou- 
ble sun systems of dear memory 
is very dim indeed. 

Incidentally, how big is the ap- 
parent size of the moon as seen 
from the earth’s surface? This has 
been tossed into many stories 
also. The usual answer is given 
linearly and is therefore mean- 
ingless. Astonishingly, a quarter 
dollar, which the mind conceives 
of as quite small, held at a dis- 
tance of nine feet, will just over- 
lap the full moon, the mental 
image of which is quite large. 
Bang! Another punctured illu- 
sion! 

Another startling demonstra- 
tion of the tricks our senses play 
on us is the actual count of eye- 
visible stars in the jampacked 
firmament of a perfect night in 
the mountains. “Millions! Bil- 
lions!” shouts Averageman, igno- 
rant of the fact that there are 
only 3,000 stars in both hemi- 
spheres of magnitude 6.5 or 
brighter, the faintest star that 
can be detected with the unaided 
eye. Getting back to the moon, if 
at any particular time it were 
to be removed from the sky, how 
many visible stars would it have 
been obscuring? The odds are 33 
to 1 that removal would reveal 
not one star behind it!

The next sacred cow slaught- 
ered by Asimov’s merciless pen 
is the “familiar constellations” 
bit so familiar in space operas of 
yore, including, I’ll bet a nine- 
foot quarter, Dr. Asimov’s own. 
In deep space, our astronauts will 
view over two and one half times 
as many naked-eye stars due to 
the elimination of atmospheric 
absorption of 30% of starlight. 
All fine details of the “familiar 
constellations” will be drowned 
out by the light of thousands of 
additional stars. 

In another chapter touchingly 
titled “The Sight of Home,” 
Asimov calculates the maximum 
distance at which our future as- 
tronauts can lift their “tear-filled, 
homesick eyes to the alien 
heavens for a glimpse of home,” 
This works out to sixty-five light 
years at the absolute threshhold 
of naked-eye visibility. In fact, 
the Alpha Centauri system, our 
closest neighbor in space, is the 
only one from which Sol can be 
seen as a first magnitude star! 
Thus, Sol can be seen at all from 
an absolute maximum of 1450 
near-by star systems. A lot, but 
certainly a tiny handful in com- 
parison with our galaxy’s total 
population of a hundred billion 
stars. 

Further speculation then leads 
Asimov to wonder just how bright 
our sun would have to be to be 
seen at increasingly greater dis- 



tances. Sirius, far brighter than 
Sol, can be seen at a maximum 
distance of 325 light years and 
Capella 850 light years. Of the 
stars visible from Earth, though, 
the championship is held by 
Rigel, over 20,000 times as lum- 
inous as Sol. Rigel can be seen 
over a range of one-fifth the 
width of the galactic lens, more 
than 9,000 light years in any 
direction. Asimov’s tear-filled 
Astronaut could say, “Oh, well, 
you can’t see our Sun from here, 
but it’s pretty close to Rigel, that 
star over there, the one you call 
Bjfxlpt.” 

As can be gathered from the 
above, good Dr. Asimov has let 
down his hair as he has never 
done in his other books aimed 
at a more general audience. He 
is among his own science-fiction- 
al friends and his free-wheeling 
joy is apparent. 

In another chapter that hits 
close to the home of most of us 
in this field, he attempts to an- 
swer the question invariably put 
to him (and all other creators of 
SF or fantasy fiction): “Where 
do you get your crazy ideas?” 
He never succeeds in pinning 
down an answer but en route he 
develops some interesting 
thoughts on creativity and intel- 
lectual breakthroughs such as 
Darwin’s. 

I can think of no one better 
supplied with such an assortment

of numerous and amazing facts, 
nor one better qualified to leap 
lightly over the enchanted 
threshold dividing Fact from 
Fancy as the author of these 
seventeen “speculative essays’*. 

GREAT SCIENCE FICTION 
BY SCIENTISTS edited by 
Groff Conklin. Collier Books. 
CONKLIN’S INSPIRATION 
has given us a fine example of 
flights of fancy by some of the 
most eminent dealers in fact of 
our time. It is more than a bit 
startling to see some of these 
names bydining a piece of fiction: 
J.B.S. Haldane, Norbert Weiner, 
Julien Huxley, Leo Szilard. 
Others have been top-ranking SF 
authors for years; Asimov, 
Arthur C Clarke, Chan Davis, 
Chad Oliver, the late Miles J. 
Breuer. Still others, when shorn 
of their literary pseudonyms, are 
names of prestige in their par- 
ticular fields; John R. Pierce, 
Willy Ley, R. S. Richardson, the 
late Eric Temple Bell. 

The most interesting thing 
about the scientists in this col- 
lection who are one-shot SF 
authors is that they all have one 
point in common; none of their 
stories are exalted flights of fan- 
cy. They have all resorted to the 
fictional approach to make some 
sharply pointed moral or ethical 
commentary on the abuse of 
knowledge. 



The little playlet, Pilot Lights 
oi the Apocalypse, by the noted 
nuclear physicist, the late Louis 
N. Ridenour, published only six 
months after Hiroshima, is one 
of the earliest and one of the 
most effective warnings against 
the possibility of push-button 
warfare that I’ve ever read. 

Both J.B.S. Haldane’s The 
Gold-Makers and Julian Hux- 
ley’s The Tissue-Culture King 
are chase thrillers in which im- 
portant discoveries are prosti- 
tuted to selfish ends. The Ulti- 
mate Catalyst by Eric Temple 
Bell (John Taine) is also, but 
it is an unashamedly commercial 
piece from the Thirties. 

The stories by the pros 
(Clarke, Asimov, Davis, Oliver) 
are polished jobs that are fair- 
representative but unexceptional. 
In fact. What // . by Isaac 
Asimov is more a piece of whim- 
sical fantasy concerning alternate 
pasts than it is straight SF. Not 
so with John Sze*s Future, a pre- 
viously unpublished story by 
“J. J. Coupling” who is John R. 
Pierce, Bell Telephone’s Director 
of Research for Communications 
Principles. It is a wry little yarn 
about a nuclear physicist, con- 
vinced of the power of psi over 
matter, dredged by unhappy 
mistake from the twentieth cen- 
tury by a psychologically orien- 
tated future in which physical 
scientists are regarded with an

aversion usually reserved for mad 
dogs. He remains oblivious to the 
true nature of the scientihc ad- 
vances, attributing them to psi. 
There is a semantic mixup con- 
cerning psi and psy, and the fu- 
ture that his delighted precon- 
ceptions lead him to see is far 
removed from the drab and 
prosaic reality. 

The author of Learning The- 
ory, James McConnell, is a re- 
search psychologist. In his story, 
he rips to shreds one of the most 
sacred tools of his profession, 
the teaching and testing of lower 
animals by rewards and/or pun- 
ishment. In his remarkably un- 
comfortable yarn that builds 
toward a high peak of frustration, 
he smashes the Learning Theory 
by casting his hero, himself a 
psychologist, in the role of the 
impotent lower animal under 
test. 

Conklin has come up with an 
engrossing “idea” anthology.

NAKED TO THE STARS by 
Gordon R. Dickson. Pyramid 
Books “DORSAI!” by Dickson 
was a cracking good war story. 
So is Naked to the Stars. 

Cal Truant, combat lieutenant, 
rather than discover what hap- 
pened during sixteen hours of 
amnesia during combat, resigns 
from active duty and enlists in 
the detested Contact Service, a 



maneuver that creates doubts 
concerning his courage. 

Contact Service, a branch of 
Earth’s fighting Combat Service, 
is noncombatant and, more the- 
oretically than actually, is re- 
sponsible for initial (and prefer- 
ably peaceful) alien contact. 

Dickson makes his reader ab- 
sorbedly aware that service in 
an organization dedicated to 
peace can require far more cour- 
age than mere combat.

THE SUPER BARBARIANS 
by John Brunner. Ace Books. 
BRUNNER'S SUPER-BARBA- 
RIANS, as were the fouteenth 
century crusaders of Poul Ander- 
son’s delightfully tongue-in-cheek 
The High Crusade, are conquer- 
ors because of their employment 
of captured ships and weapons 
that are far beyond their true 
technological capabilities. Brun- 
ner’s tale, however, is not a swash- 
buckler. He picks up the narra- 
tive thread some fifty years after 
Earth’s defeat by the Vorrish and 
draws a picture of conqueror and 
conquered that is deliberately 
reminiscent of the roles of Ro- 
man conqueror and Greek slave 
of millenia past, or the Mongols 
and the superior civilization of 
the Chinese that ultimately en- 
gulfed the victors.

BESTER'S BEST! 

Have you read his famed THE DEMOLISHED MAN ? Lived in 
its vividly real telepathic society, detailed so ingeniously and dra-
