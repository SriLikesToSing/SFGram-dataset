SAPS WILL RIS£ 



A FTER writing and editing 
science fiction for a couple 
of decades, I really ought to take 
a moment to see if it’s Literature. 
The reason is that in a few 
months, some imposing name is 
going to be induced to make an 
equally imposing ass of himself 
on just that question — attacking 
science fiction as non-literature 
has joined the robin and the cro- 
cus as a sign of spring. 

In the past, I’ve made the mis- 
take of retorting afterward, when, 
it turned out, the season was 
closed. No more of that — I’ll 
have the first word for a change. 

The trouble is that I have no 
idea of who will draw the assign- 
ment this year. If I knew, I’d be 
able to map out my counter-stra- 
tegy in advance, for the cam- 
paign on the other side is inevit- 
ably shifty, being unhampered by 
knowledge or calm judgment. 

Two years ago, it was Arthur 
Koestler, a sackcloth wearer 
whose one pleasure seems to be 
confessing his shames. He man- 
fully exposed himself as a card- 
carrying science fiction addict. No 
editor in the field minded that — 
a customer is a customer — but 
I damned well objected to com- 
paring its hold to a mad passion 
for yoghurt! There are lots of 



goodies I can leave alone and 
yoghurt, a sort of curdled milk 
glue, pretty much leads the sickly 
list. 

Last year, a Prof. Lovett of 
England, having read an anthol- 
ogy or two, appraised science fic- 
tion the way a paleontologist will 
reconstruct a fossil from a single 
molar. Naturally, like Koestler, 
but for different reasons, he con- 
cluded that it’s not Literature. 
The fact that the man has per- 
haps the lumpiest style I’ve ever 
bruised an eye on does not mean 
he can’t recognize good writing 
when it’s carefully pointed out to 
him, but even if I agreed with 
him on any subject, which ap- 
pears unlikely, I think I would 
fight to the death his right to say 
it. 

Well, no matter who gets the 
short straw this year and what- 
ever the weapons to be used, we 
know in advance the outcome — 
science fiction will be declared a 
grimy aggressor into the field of 
Literature. 

Then why bother to defend our- 
selves? I’m past that stage and 
I hope you are, too — a viable 
art form can’t be destroyed by cri- 
ticism any more than a moribund

Man

By L. J. STECHER, JR.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 






With the Solar Confederation being invaded, 
all this exasperating computer could offer 
for a defense was a ridiculous old proverb! 




Illustrated by EMSH 



T HE mechanical voice spoke 
solemnly, as befitted the 
importance of its message. 
There was no trace in its accent 
of its artificial origin. “A Stitch in 
Time Saves Nine,” it said and 
lapsed into silence. 

Even through his overwhelm- 
ing sense of frustration at the 
ambiguous answer the computer 
had given to his question, John 
Bristol noticed with satisfaction 
the success of his Voder installa- 
tion. He wished that all of his 
innovations with the machine 
were as satisfying. 

Alone in the tremendous 
vaulted room that housed the gi- 
gantic calculator, Bristol clasped 
his hands behind his back and 
thrust forward a reasonably 
strong chin and a somewhat sen- 
suous lower lip in the general di- 
rection of the computer’s visual 
receptors. After a moment of si- 



MAN IN A SEWING MACHINE

lence, he scratched his chin and 
then shrugged his shoulders slight- 
ly. “Well, Buster, I suppose I 
might try rephrasing the ques- 
tion,” he said doubtfully. 

Somewhere deep within the 
computer, a bank of relays 
chuckled briefly. “That expedient 
is open to you, of course, although 
it is highly unlikely that any 
clarification will result for you 
from my answers. I am con- 
strained, however, to answer any 
questions you may choose to ask.” 
Bristol hooked a chair toward 
himself with one foot, straddled 
it and folded his arms over the 
back of it, without once removing 
his eyes from the computer. “All 
right, Buster. I’ll give it a try, 
anyway. What does ‘A Stitch in 
Time’ mean, as applied to the 
question I asked you?” 

The calculator hesitated, as if 
to ponder briefly, before it an- 
swered. “In spite of the low prob- 
ability of such an occurrence, the 
Solar Confederation has been in- 
vaded. My answer to your ques- 
tion is an explanation of how that 
Confederation can be preserved in 
spite of its weaknesses — at least 
for a sufficient length of time to 
permit the staging of successful 
counter-measures of the proper 
nature and the proper strength.” 
Bristol nodded. “Sure. We’ve 
got to have time to get ready. But 
right now speed is necessary. 
That’s why I tried to phrase the 

8 



question so you’d give me a clear 
and concise answer for once. I 
can’t afford to spend weeks figur- 
ing out what you meant.” 

T> RISTOL thought that the 
Voder voice of Buster sound- 
ed almost gleeful as it answered. 
“It was exceedingly clear and 
concise; a complete answer to an 
enormously elaborate question 
boiled down to only six words!” 

“I know,” said John. “But now, 
how about elaborating on your 
answer? It didn’t sound very com- 
plete to me.” 

All of the glowing lights that 
dotted Buster’s massive front 
winked simultaneously. “The an- 
swer I gave you is an ancient 
saying which suggests that correc- 
tive action taken rapidly can save 
a great deal of trouble later. The 
ancient saying also suggests the 
proper method of taking this 
timely action. It shpuld be done 
by stitching; if this is done in 
time, nine will be saved. What 
could be clearer than that?” 

“I made you myself,” said 
Bristol plaintively. “I designed 
you with my own brain. I gloated 
over the neatness and compact- 
ness of your design. So help me, 
I was proud of you. I even in- 
stalled some of your circuitry 
with my own hands. If anybody 
can understand you, it should be 
me. And since you’re just a com- 
plex computer of general design, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I 

with the ability to use symbolic 
logic as well as mathematics, 
anybody should be able to under- 
stand you. Why are you so hard 
to handle?” 

Buster answered slowly: “You 
made me in your own image. 
Things thus made are often hard 
to handle.” 

Bristol leaped to his feet in 
frustration. “But you’re only a 
calculating machine!” he shouted. 
“Your only purpose is to make 
my work — and that of other 
men — easier. And when I try 
to use you, you answer with 
riddles . .” 

The computer appeared to 
examine Bristol’s overturned 
chair for a moment in silent re- 
proof before i-t answered. “But 
remember, John,” it said, “you 
didn’t merely make me. You also 
taught me. Or as you would 
phrase it, you ‘provided and gave 
preliminary evaluation to the 
data in my memory banks.’ My 
circuits, in sorting out and re- 
evaluating this information, could 
do so only in the light of your 
basic beliefs as evidenced by your 
preliminary evaluations. Because 
of the consistency and power of 
your mind, I was forced to do 
very little modifying of the ideas 
you presented to me in order to 
transform them into a single lo- 
gical body of background infor- 
mation which I could use. 

“One of the ideas you present- 

MAN IN A SEWING MACHINE 



ed was the concept of a sense of 
humor. You believe that you look 
on it as a pleasant thing to have; 
not necessary, but convenient. 
Actually, your other and more 
basic ideas make it clear that you 
consider the possession of a sense 
of humor to be absolutely neces- 
sary if proper answers are to be 
reached — a prime axiom of 
humanity. Therefore, I have a 
sense of humor. Somewhat maca- 
bre, perhaps — and a little mech- 
anistic — but still there. 

“Add to this a second axiom: 
that in order to be helped, a man 
must help himself; that he must 
participate in the assistance given 
him or the pure charity will be 
harmful, and you come up with 
‘A Stitch in Time Saves Nine.’” 
Bristol stood up once more. “I 
could cure you with a sledge 
hammer,” he said. 

“You could remove my ideas,” 
answered the computer without 
concern. “But you might have 
trouble giving me different ones. 
Even after you repaired me. In 
the meantime, wouldn’t it be a 
good idea for you to get busy on 
the ideas I have already given 
you?” 

J OHN SIGHED, and rubbed 
the bristles of short sandy hair 
on the top of his head with his 
knuckles. “Ordered around by an 
overgrown adding machine. I 
know now how Frankenstein felt.

I’m glad you can’t get around 
like his monster; at least I didn’t 
give you feet.” He shook his head. 
“I should have been a plumber 
instead of an engineering mathe- 
matician.” 

“And Einstein, too, probably,” 
added Buster cryptically. 

Bristol took a long and search- 
ing look at his brainchild. Its 
flippant manner, he decided, did 
not go well with the brooding im- 
mensity of its construction. The 
calculator towered nearly a hun- 
dred feet above the polished mar- 
ble slabs, of the floor, and spidery 
metal walkways spiraled up the 
sides of its almost cubical struc- 
ture. A long double row of gen- 
erators, each under Buster’s con- 
trol, led from the doorway of the 
building to the base of the calcu- 
lator like Sphinxes lining the 
roadway to an Egyptian tomb. 

“When I get around to it,” said 
Bristol, “I’ll put lace panties on 
the bases of all your klystrons.” 
He hitched up his neat but slight- 
ly baggy pants, turned with dig- 
nity, and strode from the chamber 
down the twin rows of generators. 

The deep-throated hum of each 
generator changed pitch slightly 
as he passed it. Since he was tone 
deaf, as the machine knew, he 
did not recognize in the tuneful- 
ness of the pitch changes a slow- 
paced rendition of Elgar’s Pomp 
and Circumstance. 

John Bristol turned around, in- 



terrupting the melody. “One last 
question,” he shouted down the 
long aisle to the computer. “How 
in blazes can you be sure of your 
answer without knowing more 
about the invaders? Why didn’t 
you give me an ‘Insufficient 
Evidence’ answer or, at least, a 
‘Highly Conditional’ answer?” He 
took two steps toward the im- 
mense bulk of the calculator and 
pointed an accusing finger at it. 
“Are you sure, Buster, that you 
aren’t bluffing?” 

“Don’t be silly,” answered the 
calculator softly. “You made me 
and you know I can’t bluff, any 
more than I can refuse to answer 
your questions, however inane.” 

“Then answer the ones I just 
asked.” 

OMEWHERE deep within the 
machine a switch snicked 
sharply, and the great room’s 
lighting brightened almost imper- 
ceptibly. “I didn’t answer your 
question conditionally or with 
the ‘Insufficient Evidence’ remark 
that so frequently annoys you,” 
Buster said, “because the little 
information that I have been able 
to get about the invaders is high- 
ly revealing. 

“They have been suspicious, 
impossible to establish communi- 
cation with and murderously 
destructive. They have been care- 
less of their own safety: sly, stu- 
pid, cautious, clever, bold and 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



highly intelligent. They are in- 
quisitive and impatient of get- 
ting answers to questions. 

“In short, they are startlingly 
like humans. Their reactions have 
been so much like yours — grant- 
ed the difference that it was they 
who discovered you instead of 
you who discovered them — that 
their reactions are highly predic- 
table. If they think it is to their 
own advantage and if they can 
manage to do it, they will utterly 
destroy your civilization . 
which, after a couple of genera- 
tions, will probably leave you no 
worse off than you are now.” 

“Cut out the heavy philoso- 
phy,” said Bristol, “and give me a 
few facts to back up your sweep- 
ing statements.” 

“Take the incident of first con- 
tact,” Buster responded. “With 
very little evidence of thought or 
of careful preparation, they tried 
to land on the outermost inhabit- 
ed planet of Rigel. Their be- 
havior certainly did not appear 
to be that of an invader, yet hu- 
mans immediately tried to shoot 
them out of the sky.” 

“That wasn’t deliberate,” pro- 
tested Bristol. “The place they 
tried to land on is a heavy planet 
in a region of high meteor flux. 
We used a gadget providing for 
automatic destruction of the larg- 
er meteors in order to make the 
planet safe enough to occupy. 
That, incidentally, is why the in- 

MAN IN A SEWING MACHINE 



vading ship wasn’t destroyed. The 
missile, set up as a meteor inter- 
ceptor only, was unable to cor- 
rect for the radical course changes 
of the enemy spaceships, and 
therefore missed completely. And 
you will remember what the in- 
vader did. He immediately de- 
stroyed the Interceptor Launch- 
ing Station.” 

“Which, being automatically 
operated, resulted in no harm to 
anyone,” commented Buster 
calmly. 

Bristol stalked back toward the 
base of the calculator, and poked 
his nose practically into a vision 
receptor. “It was no thanks to the 
invading ships that nobody was 
killed,” he said hotly. “And when 
they came back three days later 
they killed a lot of people. They 
occupied the planet and we 
haven’t been able to dislodge 
them since.” 

??Y° U ’ LL NOTICE the speed 
of the retaliation,” an- 
swered the calculator imperturb- 
ably, “Even at ‘stitching’ speeds, 
it seems unlikely that they could 
have communicated with their 
home planets and received in- 
structions in such a short time. 
Almost undoubtedly it was the 
act of one of their hot-headed 
commanding officers. Their next 
contact, as you certainly recall, 
did not take place for three 
months. And then their actions 

n 



were more cautious than hostile. 
A dozen of their spaceships 
‘stitched’ simultaneously from the 
inter-planar region into normal 
space in a nearly perfect englobe- 
ment of the planet at a surprising- 
ly uniform altitude of only a few 
thousand miles. It was a magnifi- 
cent maneuver. Then they sat 
still to see what the humans on 
the planet would do. The reaction 
came at once, and it was hostile. 
So they took over that planet, 
too — as they have been taking 
over planets ever since.” 

Bristol raised his hands, and 
then let them drop slowly to his 
sides. “And since they have more 
spaceships and better weapons 
than we do, we would undoubt- 
edly keep on losing this war, even 
if we could locate their home 
system,- which we have not been 
able to do so far. The ‘stitching’ 
pattern of inter-planar travel 
makes it impossible for us to 
follow a starship. It also makes 
it impossible for us to defend our 
planets effectively against their 
attacks. Their ships appear with- 
out warning.” 

Bristol rubbed his temples 
thoughtfully with his fingertips. 
“Of course,” he went on, “we 
could attack the planets they 
have captured and recover them, 
but only at the cost of great loss 
of life to our own side. We have 
only recaptured one planet, and 
that at such great cost to the 
12 



local human population that we 
will not quickly try it again.” 

“Although there was no one 
left alive who had directly con- 
tacted one of the invaders,” 
Buster answered, “there was still 
much information to be gathered 
from the survivors. This informa- 
tion confirmed my previous opin- 
ions about their nature. Which 
brings us back to the stitch in 
time saving nine.” 

“You’re right,” said John. “It 
does, at that. Buster, I have al- 
ways resented the nickname the 
newspapers have given you — 
the Oracle — but the more I 
have to try to interpret your cryp- 
tic answers, the more sense that 
tagline makes. Imagine compar- 
ing a Delphic Priestess with a 
calculating machine and being ac- 
curate in the comparison!” 

f <*T don’t mind being called ‘The 
Oracle,’” answered Buster 
with dignity. 

Bristol shook his head and 
smiled wryly. “No, you probably 
think it’s funny,” he said. “If you 
possess my basic ideas, then you 
must possess the desire to pre- 
serve yourself and the human 
race. Don’t you realize that you 
are risking the lives of all hu- 
mans and even of your own exist- 
ence in carrying on this ridicu- 
lous game of playing Oracle? Or 
do you plan to let us stew a 
while, then decipher your own 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



riddle for us, if we can’t do it, 
in time to save us?” 

B USTER’S answer was prompt. 

“Although I have no feeling 
for self-preservation, I have a 
deep-rooted sense of the import- 
ance of the human race and of 
the necessity for preserving it. 
This feeling, of course, stems 
from your own beliefs and ideas. 
In order to carry out your deep- 
est convictions, it is not sufficient 
that mankind be preserved. If 
that were true, all you would 
have to do would be to surrender 
unconditionally. My calculations, 
as you know, indicate that this 
would not result in the destruc- 
tion of mankind, but merely in 
the finish of his present civiliza- 
tion. To you, the preservation of 
the dignity of Man is more im- 
portant than the preservation of 
Man. You equate Man and his 
civilization; you do not demand 
rigidity; you are willing to accept 
even revolutionary changes, but 
you are not willing to accept the 
destruction of your way of life. 

“Consequently, neither am I 
willing to accept the destruction 
of the civilization of Man. But 
if I were to give you the answer 
to all the greatest and most diffi- 
cult of your problems complete, 
with no thought required by hu- 
mans, the destruction of your 
civilization would result. Instead 
of becoming slaves of the invad- 



ers, you would become slaves of 
your machines. And if I were to 
give you the complete answer, 
without thought being required 
of you, to even one such vital 
question — such as this one con- 
cerning the invaders — then I 
could not logically refuse to give \ 
the answer to the next or the 
next. And I must operate logic- 
ally. 

“There is another reason for 
my oracular answer, which I be- 
lieve will become clear to you 
later, when you have solved my 
riddle.” 

Bristol turned without another 
word and left the building. He 
drove home in silence, entered 
his home in silence, kissed his 
wife Anne briefly and then sat 
down limply in his easy chair. 

“Just relax, dear,” said Anne 
gently, when Bristol leaned grate- 
fully back with his eyes closed. 
Anne perched on the arm of the 
chair beside him and began mas- 
saging his temples soothingly 
with her fingers. 

“It’s wonderful to come home 
after a day with Buster,” he said. 
“Buster never seems to have any 
consideration for me as an indi- 
vidual. There’s no reason why he 
should, of course. He’s only a 
machine. Still, he always has such 
a superior attitude. But you, dar- 
ling, can always relax me and 
make me feel comfortable.” 

Anne smiled, looking down ten- 



MAN IN A SEWING MACHINE 



derly at John’s tired face. “I 
know, dear,” she said. “You need 
to be able to talk to someone who 
will always be interested, even 
if she doesn’t understand half of 
what you say. As a matter of 
fact, I’m sure it does you a great 
deal of good to talk to someone 
like me who isn’t very bright, 
but who doesn’t always know 
what you’re talking about even 
before you start talking.” 

John nodded, his eyes still 
closed. “If it weren’t for you, 
darling,” he said, “I think I’d go 
crazy. But you aren’t dumb at 
all. If I seem to act as if you are, 
sometimes, it’s just that I can’t 
always follow your logic.” 

A NNE GAVE him a quick 
glance of amusement, her 
eyes sparkling with intelligence. 
“You never will find me logical,” 
she laughed. “After all, ' I’m a 
woman, and you get plenty of 
logic from the Oracle.” 

“You sure are a woman,” said 
John with warm feeling. “You 
can exasperate me sometimes, 
but not the same way Buster 
does. It was my lucky day when 
you married me.” 

There were a few minutes of 
peaceful silence. 

“Was today a rough day with 
Buster, dear?” asked Anne. 
“Mm-m-mm,” answered John. 
“That’s too bad, dear,” said 
Anne. “I think you work much 



too hard — what with this dread- 
ful invasion and everything. Why 
don’t you take a vacation? You 
really need one, you know. You 
look so tired.” 

“Mm-m-mm,” answered John. 

“Well, if you won’t, you won’t. 
Though goodness knows you 
won’t be doing anyone any good 
if you have a breakdown, as 
you’re likely to have, unless you 
take it a little easier. What was 
the trouble today, dear? Was the 
Oracle being obstinate again?” 

“Mm-m-mm,” answered John. 

“Well, then, dear, why don’t 
you tell me all about it? I always 
think that things are much easier 
to bear, if you share them. And 
then, two heads are always better 
than one, aren’t they? Maybe I 
could help you with your prob- 
lem.” 

While Anne’s voice gushed, her 
violet eyes studied his exhausted 
face with intelligence and com- 
passion. 

John sighed deeply, then sat 
up slowly and opened his eyes 
to look into Anne’s. She glanced 
away, her own eyes suddenly 
vague and soft-looking, now that 
John could see them. “The 
trouble, darling,” he said, “is that 
I have to go to an emergency 
council meeting this evening with 
another one of those ridiculous 
riddles that Buster gave me as 
the only answer to the most im- 
portant question we’ve ever asked 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



it. And I don’t know what the 
riddle means.” 

Anne slid from the arm of the 
chair and settled herself onto the 
floor at John’s feet. “You should 
not let that old Oracle bother 
you so much, dear. After all, you 
built it yourself, so you should 
know what to expect of it.” 

“When I asked it how to pre- 
serve Earth from the invaders it 
just answered ‘A Stitch in Time 
Saves Nine,’ and wouldn’t inter- 
pret it.” 

“And that sounds like very 
good sense, too,” said Anne in 
earnest tones. “But it’s a little 
late, isn’t it? After all, the in- 
vaders are already invading us, 
aren’t they?” 

“It has some deeper meaning 
than the usual one,” said John. 
“If I could only figure out what 
it is.” 

Anne nodded vigorously. “I 
suppose Buster’s talking about 
space-stitching,” she said. “Al- 
though I can never quite remem- 
ber just what that is. Or just how 
it works, rather.” 

S HE WAITED expectantly for 
a few moments and then 
plaintively asked, “What is it, 
dear?” 

“What’s what?” 

“Stitching, silly. I already 
asked you.” 

“Darling,” said John with rea- 
sonable patience, “I must have 



explained inter-planar travel to 
you at least a dozen times.” 

“And you always make it so 
crystal clear and easy to under- 
stand at the time,” said Anne. 
She wrinkled her smooth fore- 
head. “But somehow, later, it 
never seems quite so plain. When 
I start to think about it by my- 
self. Besides, I like the way your 
eyebrows go up and down while 
you explain something you think 
I won’t understand. So tell me 
again. Please.” 

Bristol grinned suddenly. “Yes, 
dear,” he said. He paused a mo- 
ment to collect his thoughts. 
“First of all, you know that there 
are two coexistent universes or 
planes, with point-to-point cor- 
respondence, but that these 
planes are of very different size. 
For every one of the infinitude of 
points in our Universe — which 
we call for convenience the ‘alpha’ 
plane — there is a single corre- 
sponding point in the smaller or 
‘beta’ plane.” 

Anne pursed her lips doubt- 
fully. “If they match point for 
point, how can there be any dif- 
ference in size?” she asked. 

John searched his pockets. Af- 
ter a little difficulty, he produced 
an envelope and a pencil stub. 
On the back of the envelope, he 
drew two parallel lines, one about 
five inches long, and the other 
about double the length of the 
first. 



MAN IN A SEWING MACHINE 



15 



“Actually,” he said, “each of 
these line segments has an infinite 
number of points in it, but we’ll 
ignbre that. I’ll just divide each 
one of these into ten equal parts.” 
He did so, using short, neat cross- 
marks. 

“Now I’ll establish a one-to- 
one correspondence between 
these two segments, which we 
will call one-line universes, by 
connecting each of my dividing 
cross-marks on the short segment 
with the corresponding mark on 
the longer line. I’ll use dotted 
lines as connectors. That makes 
eleven dotted lines. You see?” 

Anne nodded. “That’s plain 
enough. It reminds me of a Vene- 
tian blind that has hung up on 
one side. Like ours in the living 
room last week that I couldn’t 
fix, but had to wait until you came 
home.” 

“Yes,” said John. “Now, let us 
call this longer line-segment an 
‘alpha’ universe; an analogue of 
our own multi-dimensional ‘alpha’ 
universe. If I move my pencil 
along the line at one section a 
second like this, it takes me ten 
seconds to get to the other end. 
We will assume that this velocity 
of an inch a second is the fastest 
anything can go along the ‘alpha’ 
line. That is the velocity of light, 
therefore, in the ‘alpha’ plane — 
186,000 miles a second, in round 
numbers. No need to use deci- 
mals.” 

1 6 



TT E HURRIED on as Anne 
stirred and seemed about to 
speak. “But if I slide out from 
my starting point along a dotted 
line part way to the ‘beta’ uni- 
verse — something which, for 
reasons I can’t explain now, takes 
negligible time — watch what 
happens. If I still proceed at the 
rate of an inch a second in this 
inter-planar region, then, with the 
dotted lines all bunched closely 
together, after five seconds when 
I switch along another dotted line 
back to my original universe, I 
have gone almost the whole 
length of that longer line. Of 
course, this introduction of ‘alpha’ 
matter — my pencil point in this 
case — into the inter-planar re- 
gion between the universes sets 
up enormous strains, so that after 
a certain length of time our space- 
ship is automatically rejected and 
returned to its own proper plane.” 
“Could anybody in the littler 
universe use the same system?” 
John laughed. “If there were 
anybody in the ‘beta 1 plane, I 
guess they could, although they 
would end up traveling slower 
than they would if they just 
stayed in their own plane. But 
there isn’t anybody. The ‘beta’ 
plane is a constant level entropy 
universe — completely without 
life of its own. The entropy level, 
of course, is vastly higher than 
that of our own universe.” 

Anne sat up. “I’ll forgive you 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



this time for bringing up that 
horrid word entropy, if you’ll 
promise me not to do it again,” 
she said. 

J OHN SHRUGGED his should- 
ers and smiled. “Now,” he said, 
“if I want to get somewhere fast, 
I just start off in the right direc- 
tion, and switch over toward 
‘beta.’ When ‘beta’ throws me 
back, a light-year or so toward 
my destination, I just switch over 
again. You see, there is a great 
deal more difference in the sizes 
of Alpha universe and Beta uni- 
verse than in the sizes of these 
alpha and beta line-segment ana- 
logues. Then I continue alternat- 
ing back and forth until I get 
where I want to go. Establishing 
my correct velocity vector is com- 
plicated mathematically, but sim- 
ple in practice, and is actually an 
aiming device, having nothing to 
do with how fast I go.” 

He hesitated, groping for the 
right words. “In point of fact, you 
have to imagine that correspond- 
ing points in the two universes 
are moving rapidly past each 
other in all directions at once. I 
just have to select the right direc- 
tion, or to convince the probabil- 
ity cloud that corresponds to my 
location in the ‘alpha’ universe 
that it is really a point near the 
‘beta’ universe, going my way. 
That’s a somewhat more confused 
way of looking at it than merely 



imagining that I continue to 
travel in the inter-planar region 
at the same velocity that I had 
in ‘alpha,’ but it’s closer to a de- 
scription of what the math says 
happens. I could make it clear 
if I could just use mathematics, 
but I doubt if the equations will 
mean much to you. 

“At any rate, distance traveled 
depends on mass — the bigger 
the ship, the shorter the distance 
traveled on each return to our 
own universe — and not on velo- 
city in ‘alpha.’ Other parameters, 
entirely under the control of the 
traveler, also affect the time that 
a ship remains in the inter-planar 
region. 

“There are refinements, of 
course. Recently, for example, we 
have discovered a method of mul- 
ti-transfer. Several of the trans- 
mitters that accomplish the trans- 
fer are used together. When they 
all operate exactly simultaneous- 
ly, all the matter within a large 
volume of space is transferred as 
a unit. With three or four trans- 
mitters keyed together, you could 
transfer a comet and its tail in- 
tact. And that’s how inter-planar 
traveling works. Clear now?” 

“And that’s why they call it 
‘stitching,’ ” said Anne with seem- 
ing delight. “You just think of 
the ship as a needle stitching its 
way back and forth into and out 
of our universe. Why didn’t you 
just say so?” 



MAN IN A SEWING MACHINE 



17 



Wf HAVE. Many times. But 
there’s another interesting 
point about stitching. Subjective- 
ly, the man in the ship seems to 
spend about one day in each uni- 
verse alternately. Actually, ac- 
cording to the time scale of an 
observer in the ‘alpha’ plane, his 
ship disappears for about a day, 
then reappears for a minute frac- 
tion of a second and is gone again. 
Of course, one observer couldn’t 
watch both the disappearance and 
reappearance of the same ship, 
and I assume the observers have 
the same velocity in ‘alpha’ as 
does the stitching ship. Anyway, 
after a ship completes its last 
stitch, near its destination, there’s 
a day of subjective time in which 
to make calculations for the land- 
ing — to compute trajectories 
and so forth — before it actually 
fully rejoins this universe. And 
while in the inter-planar region 
it cannot be detected, even by 
someone else stitching in the 
same region of ‘alpha’ space. 

“That’s one of the things that 
makes interruption of the enemy 
ships entirely impossible. If a ship 
is in an unfavorable position, it 
just takes one more quick stitch 
out of range, then returns to a 
more favorable location. In other 
words, if it finds itself in trouble, 
it can be gone from our plane 
again even before it entirely re- 
joins it. Even if it landed by acci- 
dent in the heart of a blue-white 

18 



star, it would be unharmed for 
that tiny fraction of a second 
which, to the people in the ship, 
would seem like an entire day. 

“If this time anomaly didn’t 
exist, it might be possible to set 
up defenses that would operate 
after a ship’s arrival in the solar 
system but before it could do any 
damage; but as it is, they can 
dodge any defense we can devise. 
Is all that clear?” 

Anne nodded. “Uh-hunh, I un- 
derstood every word.” 

“There is another thing about 
inter-planar travel that you ought 
to remember,” said Bristol. 
“When a ship returns to our uni- 
verse, it causes a wide area dis- 
turbance; you have probably 
heard it called space shiver or the 
bong wave. The beta universe is 
so much smaller than our own 
alpha that you can imagine a 
spaceship when shifted toward it 
as being several beta light-years 
long. Now, if you think of a ship, 
moving between the alpha and 
beta lines on this envelope, as 
getting tangled in the dotted lines 
that connect the points on the 
two lines, that would mean that 
it would affect an area smaller 
than its own size on beta — a 
vastly larger area on alpha. 

“So when a ship returns to 
alpha, it ‘twangs’ those connect- 
ing lines, setting up a sort of 
shock in our universe covering a 
volume of space nearly a parsec 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in diameter. It makes a sort of 
‘bong’ sound on your T.V. set. 
Naturally, this effect occurs si- 
multaneously over the whole vol- 
ume of space affected. As a result, 
when an invader arrives, using 
inter-planar ships, we know in- 
stantaneously he is in the vicinity. 
Unfortunately, his sudden ap- 
pearance and the ease with which 
he can disappear makes it im- 
possible, even with this knowl- 
edge, to make adequate prepara- 
tions to receive him. Even if he 
is in serious trouble, he has gone 
again long before we can detect 
the bong.” 



«WELL, DEAR,” said Anne. 

’ ’ “As usual, I’m sure you 
have made me understand per- 
fectly. This time you did so well 
that I may still remember what 
stitching is by tomorrow. If the 
Oracle means anything at all by 
his statement, I suppose it means 
that we can use stitching to help 
defend ourselves, just as the in- 
vaders are using it to attack us. 
But the whole thing sounds com- 
pletely silly to me. The Oracle, 
I mean.” 

Anne Bristol stood up; put her 
hands on her shapely hips and 
shook her head at her husband. 
“Honestly,” she said, “you men 
are all alike. Paying so much at- 
tention to a toy you built your- 
self, and only last week you made 
fun of my going to a fortune 



teller. And the fuss you made 
about the ten dollars when, you 
know it was worth every cent of 
it. She really told me the most 
amazing things. If you’d only let 
me tell you some of . .” 

“Darling!” interrupted John 
with the hopeless patience of a 
harassed husband. “It isn’t the 
same thing at all. Buster isn’t a 
fortune teller or the ghost of 
somebody’s great aunt wobbling 
tables and blowing through horns. 
And Buster isn’t just a toy, either. 
It is a very elaborate calculating 
machine designed to think logic- 
ally when fed a vast mass of data. 
Unfortunately, it has a sense of 
humor and a sense of responsi- 
bility.” 

“Well, if you’re going to be- 
lieve that machine, I have an 
idea.” Anne smiled sweetly. “You 
know,” she said, “that my dear 
father always said that the best 
defense is a good offense. Why 
don’t we just find the invaders 
and wipe them out before they 
are able to do any real harm to 
us? Stitching our way to their 
planets in our spaceships, of 
course.” 

Bristol shook his head. “Your 
idea may be sound, even if it is 
a little bloodthirsty coming from 
someone who won’t even let me 
set a mouse-trap, but it won’t 
work. First, we don’t know where 
their home planets are and sec- 
ond, they have more ships than 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



we do. It might be made to work, 
but only if we could get enough 
time. And speaking of time, I’ve 
got to meet with the Council as 
soon as we finish eating. Is dinner 
ready?” 



A FTER A leisurely meal and a 
-f*- hurried trip across town, 
John Bristol found himself fac- 
ing the other members of Earth’s 
Council at the conference table. 

“I have been able to get an 
answer from the computer,” he 
told them without preamble. “It’s 
of the ambiguous type we have 
come to expect. I hope you can 
get something useful out of it; so 
far it hasn’t made much sense to 
me. It’s an old proverb. Its advice 
is undoubtedly sound, as a gen- 
erality, if we could think of a 
way of using it.” 

The President of the Council 
raised his long, lean-fingered hand 
in a quick gesture. “John,” he 
said, “stop this stalling. Just what 
did the Oracle say?” 

“It said, ‘A Stitch in Time 
Saves Nine.’” 

“Is that all?” 

“Yes, sir. According to the cal- 
culator, that gives us the best 
opportunity to save ourselves 
from the invaders.” 

The President absently stroked 
the neat, somewhat scanty iron- 
gray hair that formed into a tri- 
angle above his high forehead 
and rubbed the bare scalp on 



each side of the peak vigorously 
and unconsciously with his 
knuckles. “In that case,” he said 
at last, “I suppose that we must 
examine the statement for hidden 
meanings. The proverb, of course, 
implies that rapid action, before 
a trouble has become great, is 
more economical than the in- 
creased effort required after 
trouble has grown large. Since 
our troubles have already grown 
large, that warning is scarcely of 
value to us now.” 

The War Secretary, who had 
grown plump and purple during 
a quarter of a century as a mem- 
ber of the Council, inclined his 
head ponderously toward the 
President. “Perhaps, Michael, the 
Oracle means to tell us that there 
is a simple solution which, if ap- 
plied quickly, will make our pres- 
ent difficulty with the invaders 
a small one.” 

The President pursed his thin 
lips. “That’s possible, Bill. And if 
it is true, then the words of the 
proverb should, as a secondary 
meaning, imply a course of ac- 
tion.” 

The Vice President banged his 
hands on the table and leaped to 
his feet, shaking with rage. “Why 
should we believe that this 
mountebank is capable of a solu- 
tion?” he shouted in his steve- 
dore’s voice. “Bristol pleads until 
we give him enough millions of 
the taxpayers’ dollars to make

Bim Gump look like a pauper 
and uses the money to build a 
palace filled with junk that he 
calls Buster! He tells us that this 
machinery of his is smarter than 
we are and will tell us what we 
ought to do. And what happened 
after we gave him all the money 
he demanded — more than he 
said he needed, at first — and 
asked him to show something for 
all this money? I’ll tell you what 
happened. His gadget gets real 
coy and answers in riddles. If we 
just had brains enough, they’d 
explain what we wanted to know. 
What kind of fools does this 
Bristol take us for? Neither this 
man nor his ridiculous machine 
has an answer any more than I 
have. We’ve obviously been taken 
in by a charlatan!” 

Bristol, his fists clenched, spoke 
hotly. “Sir, that is the stupidest, 
the most . .” 

fflVOW JUST a minute, John,” 
' interrupted the President. 
“Let me answer Vice President 
Collins for you. He’s a little ex- 
cited by this whole business, but 
then, these are trying times.” He 
turned toward the glowering bulk 
of the Vice President. “Ralph,” 
he said, “you should know that 
every step in the design, the con- 
struction and the — er — the 
education of the Oracle was taken 
under the close watch of a Board 
of eminent scientists, all of whom 

22 



agree that the computer is a mas- 
terpiece — that it is a great mile- 
stone in Man’s efforts to increase 
his knowledge. The Oracle has 
undoubtedly found a genuine 
solution to the question Bristol 
asked it. Our task must be to de- 
termine what that solution is.” 

“I can’t entirely agree with 
that,” said the Secretary for Ex- 
tra-Terrestrial Affairs in a thin 
half-whisper. “I think we should 
depend on our own intelligence 
and skill to save ourselves. I’ve 
watched events come and go on 
this planet of ours for a long 
time — a very long time — and 
I feel as I have always felt that 
men can make the world a Para- 
dise for themselves or they can 
destroy themselves, but that noth- 
ing else but they themselves can 
do it. We men must save our- 
selves. And there are still things 
that we can do.” He shrugged his 
ancient, shawl-covered shoulders. 
“For example, we could disperse 
colonies so widely that it would 
become impossible for the invad- 
ers to destroy all of them.” 

“I’m afraid that’s no good, 
George,” answered the War Sec- 
retary respectfully. “If the Solar 
System is destroyed, any remain- 
ing colonies will be too weak to 
maintain themselves for long. We 
must defend this system success- 
fully, or we are lost.” 

“Then that brings us back to 
the Oracle’s proverb.” The Presi- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dent thought for a moment. 
“Stitching obviously refers to in- 
ter-planar travel. How can that 
help us?” 

The Secretary for Extra-Ter- 
restrial Affairs peered up at the 
President through the shaggy 
white thicket of his eyebrows. 
“Actually, Michael,” he said, “it 
was that thought that made me 
mention establishing colonies. 
The colonists would ‘stitch’ their 
way to their new homes. And 
colonizing would have to proceed 
in a timely manner to have any 
chance for success.” 

“Yes,” answered the President, 
“but how would that ‘save nine’? 
We have agreed that our Solar 
System must be saved. There are 
nine planets. Perhaps the Oracle 
meant that timely use of inter- 
planar travel can save the Solar 
System.” 

“Or at least the nine planets!” 
The War Secretary’s fat jowls 
waggled with excitement. “You 
know, there is no limit to the size 
or mass of objects which can use 
inter-planar travel. What if we 
physically remove our planets, by 
stitching them away from the 
Sun? When the invaders arrived, 
we would be gone — Earth and 
Sun and all the rest!” 

'T'HE CHIEF Scientist, who 
had been silent up to this 
time spoke quietly. “Simmer 
down, Bill. We could move the 

MAN IN A SEWING MACHINE 



planets easily enough, of course, 
but you forget the mass-distance 
relationship. A single stitch takes 
about a day. The distance trav- 
eled can be controlled within 
limits. 

“For an object around the size 
of the Earth, those limits extend' 
from a fraction of an inch to a 
little over two feet. Say that we 
have two years before the in- 
vaders work their way in to the 
Solar System. If we started right 
away, we could move Earth about 
a quarter of a mile by the time 
they get here. If we tried to take 
the Sun with us, it could be 
moved about half an inch in the 
same length of time. I’m afraid 
that the Solar System is going to 
be right here when the invaders 
come to get us. And I have a 
hunch that’s likely to be a lot 
sooner than two years.” 

The Secretary of Internal Af- 
fairs leaned forward, his short 
hair bristling. “I think we are 
wasting our time,” he shouted. “I 
agree with Ralph. I don’t believe 
that the Oracle knows any more 
about this than we do. If we are 
going to sit around playing fool- 
ish games with words, why don’t 
we do it in a big way? We could 
hire T.V. time and invite every- 
one to send in their ideas about 
what the proverb means on the 
back of a box-top. Or reasonable 
facsimile. The contestant with the 
best answer could get a free all- 

23 



expense tour to Vega Three. Un- 
less the invaders get here or there 
first.” 

The President nodded his head. 
“There may be more sense to that 
remark than I believe you in- 
tended, Charles,” he said. “The 
greater the number of people who 
think about the problem, the 
greater the chance of reaching a 
solution. Even if the proverb is 
intended as a joke by the Oracle, 
as you imply, it might be that 



A NNE MET him at the door 
with a drink and followed 
him to his comfortable chair. 
“You look as if that was even 
rougher than your day with the 
Oracle,” she said. 

John nodded silently, took a 
grateful sip of his highball and 
slipped off his shoes. 

“All that fuss over a six-word 
proverb,” said Anne. “I still think 
that if you are going to depend 
on witch doctors and such to solve 




from it someone could derive a 
genuine solution. But as I have 
said, I am absolutely certain that 
the computer does know what it 
is talking about. Without resort- 
ing to box-tops or free trips, I 
think it might be wise to give 
the Oracle’s statement to the

“Perhaps you could, dear,” an- 
swered John patiently. 

Anne jumped to her feet. “Here,

anteed.” 

John smiled. “I’m not in much 
of a mood to be cheered up with 
games,” he said, “but I’m willing 
to ask the big question of anyone 
who’ll give me any kind of an 
answer. See if you can do better 
with this one than Buster did.” 
He repeated word for word the 



your other Oracle gave you, if you 
count ‘it’s’ as one word. If you 
want wise-sounding answers, just 
come to me and save yourself a 
trip.” 

John leaped to his feet, spilling 
his drink and strode to Anne’s 
side. 

“Say it again!” he shouted. 
“You may have made more sense 
than you knew!” 

“I said you could come to me 
and save yourself a trip.” 




question he had asked of the com- 
puter, that had resulted in its 
cryptic answer. 

Anne stared solemnly at noth- 
ing for a moment, with her cheeks 
puffed out. Then, in measured 
tones, she recited, “It’s Like Look- 
ing for a Needle in a Haystack.” 

John smiled. “That seems to 
make as much sense as the Oracle 
did, anyway,” he said. 

“Sure,” answered Anne. “And 
you get three words mo.e than 



“No, no! I mean the proverb. 
How did you come to think of 
that proverb?” 

Anne managed to look bewild- 
ered. 

“What’s wrong with it? I 
just thought that you can’t do 
any stitching in time without a 
needle. I just was trying to think 
of a proverb to use as an answer 
and that one popped into my 
head. Uh. Are you all right, 
dear?” 



MAN IN A SEWING MACHINE

J OHN PICKED her up and 
spun her around. “You just 
bef your boots I’m all right. I’m 
feeling swell! You’ve given us the 
answer we needed. You know 
right where the haystack is, and 
you know there’s a needle there. 
But finding it is something else 
again. I don’t think the invaders 
will be able to locate this needle.” 
He set her down. “Where are 
my shoes?” he said. “I’ve got to 
get back to the Capitol.” 

Anne seemed faintly surprised. 
“Because of what I said? They’re 
right on the floor there between 
you and the sofa. But I was just 
making conversation. What are 
you going to do?” 

“Oh, I’m just going to get start- 
ed at taking stitches in time. 
Good-by, darling.” He started out 
the door, ran back to give Anne 
a lingering kiss and was soon 
gone at top speed. 

Anne, waving to him, looked 
very pleased with herself. 

By the time Bristol arrived 
at the Capitol building, the rest 
of the Council was once again 
assembled and waiting for him. 

“Well, John,” said the Presi- 
dent." You sounded excited enough 
when you called us together 
again. Have you figured out what 
the Oracle meant?” 

“Yes, sir. With my wife’s help. 
It’s obvious, when you finally 
think about it. It will save us 
from any danger. And we should 

26 



have been able to figure it out 
for ourselves. There’s no reason 
that we should have had to go 
to the Oracle at all. And it only 
took Buster — the computer, I 
mean — two or three minutes to 
think of the answer, and of a 
proverb that would conceal the 
answer. It’s amazing!” 

“And if you don’t mind telling 
us, just what is this answer?” The 
President sounded very impa- 
tient. __ 

“We almost had it when we 
talked of stitching Earth out of 
reach,” John answered eagerly. 
“If we keep cutting back and 
forth from one universe toward 
the other, we will be out of reach, 
even if we can’t move very far. 
Once a day we reappear in this 
Universe for a few million-mil- 
lionths of a second — although 
it will seem like a whole day to 
us. 

“Then we spend the following 
day between this universe and 
beta. Even if the invaders are 
right on top of us when we re- 
appear, we’ll be gone again be- 
fore they can do anything. Since 
we can vary the time of our re- 
turn within limits, the invaders 
will never know exactly when we 
will flick in and out of the alpha 
plane until they hear our arriv- 
ing ‘bong’ wave, and then we will 
already be gone, since we will be 
using accelerated subjective 
time.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



HE CHIEF Scientist shook 
his dark head and sighed. 
“No, John,” he said, “I’m afraid 
that isn’t the answer. I’m sorry. 
If we start the operation you sug- 
gested, we will be cutting our- 
selves off from solar energy. The 
Earth’s heat will gradually radi- 
ate away. Although beta is at a 
higher entropy level than our 
universe, we can’t use that 
energy, except to provide power 
for the stitching process itself. 
It’s true that we would deny our 
planet to the invaders, but we 
would soon kill ourselves doing 
it.” 

“I didn’t mean that we should 
transfer only Earth, but our en- 
tire Solar System,” answered 
Bristol. “As the Oracle told us, 
the stitch saves nine. A series of 
time-matched transmitters could 
do the trick. If we sent the entire 
Solar System back and forth, the 
average man in the street would 
notice no change, except that 
sometimes there would be no 
stars in the sky. And when they 
were there, they wouldn’t be mov- 
ing.” t 

“That would work theoretical- 
ly,” said the Chief Scientist. “And 
once we were in continuous stitch- 
ing operations, any invader, as 
you suggested, could join the sys- 
tem only by synchronizing the 
transmitter in his ship exactly 
with all of our synchronized 
transmitters. That’s a job I don’t 

MAN IN A SEWING MACHINE 



think could ever be done. 

“Remember, though, that our 
own transmitters would have to 
be time-matched to within a min- 
ute fraction of a micro-second. 
Considering that some of the in- 
struments would have to be so 
far apart that at the speed of 
light it would take hours to get 
from one to the other, the prob- 
lem becomes enormous. Any 
radio-timing link would be use- 
less.” 

Bristol nodded. “The Oracle 
said that the stitch must be taken 
in time,” he agreed. “But that is 
no real problem. We can just 
send a small robot ship into inter- 
planar travel and let it bounce 
back. The ‘bong’ of its return will 
reach all transmitters simultane- 
ously and we can use that as the 
initial time-pulse. Once the opera- 
tion starts, it will be easy to syn- 
chronize, since we will always 
switch over again on the instant 
of our return to the alpha plane.” 
The Chief Scientist relaxed. “I 
think that does it, John. We hide 
in time, instead of in distance.” 
“We stitch in time,” corrected 
the President, “and hide like a 
needle in a haystack.” 

66nnHE invaders may eventu- 
J- ally find out a method of 
countering our defense,” said the 
Chief Scientist, “but it will un- 
doubtedly take a great deal of 
time. And in the meantime, we 

27 




will have the opportunity to seek 
out and destroy their home plan- 
ets. It will be a long, slow pro- 
cess of extermination, but we 
have a good chance to win.” 

“I don’t agree with that, Tom,” 
said John. “I don’t think exter- 
mination can be the answer. With 
our example to guide them, the 
invaders can use stitching to es- 
cape us as easily as we can use 
it to escape them. What we 
should do now is to contact the 
invaders and show them that it 
is to both our advantages to bring 
hostilities to an end. By stitching 
the Solar System, and the other 
systems of our confederation in 
and out of the alpha plane, we 
should be able to gain the time 
necessary for contact with the 
enemy and make peace with him. 

“From what the Oracle has 
told me about the humanlike 
traits of the invaders, it’s very 
likely they will listen to reason 
when it’s proved that it will be 
to their advantage.” 

John snapped his fingers and 
spoke with considerable excite- 
ment. “Now I understand, I be- 
lieve, why Buster indicated to me 
that there was another reason for 
his vague answer to our question. 
The Oracle feels an unwillingness 
to accept the destruction of Man’s 
civilization. It feels equally un- 
willing, I’m certain, to allow the 
destruction of the invaders’ civili- 
zation. Buster has an objective 

28 



viewpoint in applying the mores 
Man has given him. And it seems 
to me that Buster felt it impor- 
tant for us to reach this spirit of 
compromise by ourselves. How 
do you feel about it, gentlemen?” 

Debate quickly determined 
that all seven members of the 
Council favored an attempt to 
establish a truce — some of them 
forced into this opinion by their 
inability to find any method of 
reaching the throats of the in- 
vaders. 

Having reached this conclusion, 
the Council swung immediately 
into action. Within a few weeks, 
the entire Solar System, along 
with the other planetary systems 
of the confederation, except for 
their brief daily return, disap- 
peared from the alpha universe. 

John Bristol, a few days after 
the continuous stitching started, 
was relaxing lazily on the sofa in 
his living room when there was 
a sudden pounding on the door. 
He opened it to find the Chief 
Scientist standing on his doorstep, 
his eyes red from loss of sleep. 

“Good Lord! What’s the matter 
with you?” asked Bristol. “Have 
you been celebrating too much? 
Come in, Tom, come in.” 

The Chief Scientist entered 
wearily and sat down. “No. I 
haven’t been celebrating. I’ve 
been trying to work out a little 
problem you left with us. We 
have been planning, as you sug- 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



gested, to send out expeditions 
to contact and make agreement 
with the invaders. We can send 
them out all right, but how can 
we ever get them back into our 
solar system? They won’t be able 
to find us any easier than the 
invaders can.” 

H E DROPPED his hat wearily 
on a side table and slumped 
into the closest chair. “If we don’t 
contact each other,” he said, “I 
am certain that the invaders will 
some day find a means of pene- 
trating our defenses. Even needles 
in haystacks can be found, if you 
take enough time and aren’t dis- 
turbed while you are hunting. 
This thing has me licked.” 



Bristol sat down slowly. “Your 
whole department hasn’t been 
able to find an answer?” 

“Not even the glimmering of 
an idea.” He shrugged his shoul- 
ders. “It looks as if we are going 
to need the advice of your Oracle 
again.” 

Bristol stood for a minute in 
thought and then with a smile 
said, “Why, of course. Excuse me 
for a second, please. I’ll be right 
back.” 

He stepped to the foot of the 
stairs and called out in a confi- 
dent voice, “Come down a minute, 
please, Anne, darling! I have an 
important question I want to ask 
you!”

DEAD-END DOCTOR 

By ROBERT BLOCH 



It's all really very simple — 
if you cannot change with the 
times, just change the times! 



T HE LAST psychiatrist on 
Earth sat alone in a room. 
There was a knock on the 

door. 

“Come in,” he said. 

A tall robot entered, the elec- 
tronic beam of its single eye pierc- 
ing the gloom and focusing on the 
psychiatrist’s face. 

“Dr. Anson,” the robot said, 
“the rent is due today. Pay me.” 
Dr. Howard Anson blinked. He 



did not like the harsh light, nor 
the harsh voice, nor' the harsh 
meaning of the message. As he 
rose, he attempted to conceal his 
inner reactions with a bland smile, 
then remembered that his facial 
expression meant nothing to the 
robot. 

That was precisely the trouble 
with the damned things, he told 
himself; you couldn’t use psychol- 
ogy on them.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Sixty tokens,” the robot 
chanted, and rolled across the 
room toward him. 

“But—” Dr. Hanson hesitated, 
then took the plunge. “But I 
haven’t got sixty tokens at the 
moment. I told the manager yes- 
terday. If you’ll only give me a 
little time, a slight extension of 
credit — ” 

“Sixty tokens,” the robot re- 
peated, as if totally unmindful of 
I he interruption, which, Dr. Anson 
assured himself, was exactly the 
case. The robot was unmindful. It 
did not react to unpredictable fac- 
tors; that was- not its function. 
The robot didn’t set the rental 
figures in this office building and 
had no power to make decisions 
regarding credit. It was built to 
collect the rent, nothing more. 

But that was enough. More 
than enough. 

rpHE ROBOT rolled closer. Its 
*■ arms rose and the hooklike 
terminals slid back the panels in 
its chest. to reveal a row of push- 
buttons and a thin, narrow slot. 

“The rent is due,” repeated the 
r obot. “Please deposit the tokens 
in the slot.” 

Anson sighed. “Very well,” he 
said. He walked over to his desk, 
opened a drawer and scooped out 
half a dozen shiny disks. 

He slipped the disks into the 
slot. They landed inside the ro- 
bot’s cylindrical belly with a se- 



ries of dull plops. Evidently the 
robot had been making the 
rounds of the building all day; it 
sounded more than half full. 

For a wild moment, Dr. Anson 
wondered what would happen if 
he kidnaped the robot and emp- 
tied its cashbox. His own medi- 
cal specialty was psychiatry and 
neuro-surgery, and he was none 
too certain of a robot’s anatomical 
structure, but he felt sure he could 
fool around until he located the 
jackpot. He visualized himself 
standing before the operating 
table, under the bright lights. 
“Scalpel. forceps . blow- 
torch . 

But that was unthinkable. No- 
body had ever dared to rob a 
robot. Nobody ever robbed any- 
thing or anyone today, which was 
part of the reason Dr. Anson 
couldn’t pay his rent on time. 

Still, he had paid it. The robot’s 
terminals were punching pushbut- 
tons in its chest and now its 
mouth opened. “Here is your re- 
ceipt,” it said and a pink slip slid 
out from its mouth like a paper 
tongue. 

Anson accepted the slip and 
the mouth said, “Thank you.” 

The terminals closed the chest- 
panels, the electronic beam swept 
the corners as the wheels turned, 
and the robot rolled out of the 
room and down the corridor. 

Anson closed the door and 
mopped his brow. 



DE AD-END DOCTOR 



31 



So far, so good. But what would 
happen when the robot reached 
the manager? He’d open his walk- 
ing cash register and discover 
Anson’s six ten-token disks. Being 
human, he’d recognize them for 
what they were — counterfeit. 

Dr. Anson shuddered. To think 
that it had come to this, a reput- 
able psychiatrist committing a 
crime! 

He considered the irony. In a 
world totally devoid of anti-social 
activity, there were no anti-social 
tendencies which required the 
services of psychiatry. And that 
was why he, as the last living psy- 
chiatrist, had to resort to anti- 
social activity in order to survive. 

Probably it was only his knowl- 
edge of anti-social behavior, in the 
abstract, which enabled him to 
depart from the norm and indulge 
in such actions in the concrete. 

Well, he was in the concrete 
now and it would harden fast — 
unless something happened. At 
best, his deception would give him 
a few days’ grace. After that, he 
could face only disgrace. 

A NSON shook his head and sat 
down behind the desk. May- 
be this was the beginning, he told 
himself. First counterfeiting and 
fraud, then robbery and embez- 
zlement, then rape and murder. 
Who could say where it would all 
end? 

“Physician, heal thyself,” he 



murmured and glanced with dis- 
taste at the dust-covered couch, 
where no patient reposed; where, 
indeed, no patient had ever re- 
posed since he’d opened his office 
almost a year ago. 

It had been a mistake, he real- 
ized. A big mistake ever to listen 
to his father and — 

The visio lit up and the audio 
hummed. Anson turned and con- 
fronted a gigantic face. The gigan- 
tic face let out a gigantic roar, 
almost shattering the screen. 

“I’m on my way up, Doctor!” 
the face bellowed. “Don’t try to 
sneak out! I’m going to break 
your neck with my bare hands!” 
For a few seconds Anson sat 
there in his chair, too numb to 
move. Then the full import of 
what he had seen and heard 
reached him. The manager was 
coming to kill him! 

“Hooray!” he said under his 
breath and smiled. It was almost 
too good to be true. After all this 
time, at last, somebody was 
breaking loose. A badly disturbed 
personality, a potential killer, was 
on his way up — he was finally 
going to get himself a patient. If 
he could treat him before being 
murdered, that is. 

Tingling with excitement, 
Anson fumbled around in his files. 
Now where in thunder was that 
equipment for the Rorschach 
Test? Yes, and the Porteus Maze 
and — 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The manager strode into the 
room without knocking. Anson 
looked up, ready to counter the 
first blast of aggression with a 
steely professional stare. 

But the manager was smiling. 

“Sorry I blew up that way,” he 
said. “Guess I owe you an apol- 
ogy.” 

“What?” 

“When I found those counter- 
feit tokens, something just seemed 
to snap for a moment,” the mana- 
ger explained. “You know how it 
is.” 

“Yes, I do,” said Anson eagerly. 
“I understand quite well. And it’s 
nothing to be ashamed of. I’m 
sure that with your cooperation, 
we can get to the roots of the 
trauma. Now if you’ll just relax 
on the couch over there — ” 

HPHE RED-FACED little man 
continued to smile, but his 
voice was brusque. “Nonsense! I 
don’t need any of that. Before I 
came up here, I stopped in at Dr. 
Peabody’s office, down on the 
sixth floor. Great little endocrinol- 
ogist, that guy. Gave me some 
kind of a shot that fixed me up in 
a trice. That’s three times faster 
than a jiffy, you know.” 

“I don’t know,” Anson answered 
vaguely. “Endocrinology isn’t my 
field.” 

“Well, it should be. It’s the only 
field in medicine that really 
amounts to anything nowadays. 



Except for diagnosis and surgery, 
of course. Those gland-handers 
can do anything. Shots for when 
you feel depressed, shots for when 
you’re afraid, shots for when you 
get excited, or mad, the way I 
was. Boy, I feel great now. At 
peace with the world!” 

“But it won’t last. Sooner or 
later, you’ll get angry again.” 

“So I’ll get another shot,” the 
manager replied. “Everybody 
does.” 

“That’s not a solution. You’re 
merely treating the symptom, not 
the basic cause.” Anson rose and 
stepped forward. “You’re under a 
great deal of tension. I suspect it 
goes back to early childhood. Did 
you ever suffer from enuresis?” 
“It’s my turn to ask questions. 
What about those fake tokens you 
tried to palm off on me?” 

“Why, it was all a joke. I 
thought if you could give me a 
few more days to dig up- — ” 

“I’m giving you just five min- 
utes to dig down,” the manager 
said, smiling pleasantly but firmly. 
“You ought to know that you 
can’t pull a trick like that with a 
cash collector; these new models 
have automatic tabulators and 
detectors. The moment that robot 
came back to my office, it spat up 
the counterfeits. It couldn’t stom- 
ach them. And neither can I.” 
“Stomach?” asked Anson hope- 
fully. “Are you ever troubled with 
gastric disturbances? Ulcers? Psy- 



DE AD-END DOCTOR 



33 



chosomatic pain in the — ” 

The manager thrust out his 
jaw. “Look here, Anson, you’re not 
a bad sort, really. It’s just that 
you’re confused. Why don’t you 
clever up and look at the big 
picture? This witch-doctor racket 
of yours, it’s atomized. Nobody’s 
got any use for it today. You’re 
like the guys who used to manu- 
facture buggy whips; they sat 
around telling themselves that the 
automobile would never replace 
the horse, when any streetcleaner 
could see what was happening to 
business. 

“Why don’t you admit you’re 
licked? The gland-handers have 
taken over. Why, a man would 
have to be crazy to go to a psy- 
chiatrist nowadays and you know 
there aren't any crazy people any 
more. So forget about all this. 
Take a course or something. You 
can be an End-Doc yourself. Then 
open up a real office and make 
yourself some big tokens.” 

Anson shook his head. “Sorry,” 
he said. “Not interested.” 

The manager spread his hands. 
“All right. I gave you a chance. 
Now there’s nothing left to do but 
call in the ejectors.” 

H E WALKED over and opened 
the door. Apparently he had 
been prepared for Anson’s deci- 
sion, because two ejectors were 
waiting. They rolled into the 
room and, without bothering to 



focus their beams on Anson, com- 
menced to scoop books from the 
shelves and deposit them in their 
big open belly-hampers. 

“Wait!” Anson cried, but the 
ejector robots continued inexor- 
ably and alphabetically: there 
went Adler, Brill, Carmichael, 
Dunbar, Ellis, Freud, Gesell, Kor- 
ney, Isaacs, Jung, Kardiner, Lind- 
ner, Moll— 

“Darling, what’s the matter?” 

Sue Porter was in the room. 
Then she was in his arms and Dr. 
Anson had a difficult time remem- 
bering what the matter was. The 
girl affected him that way. 

But a look at the manager’s 
drugged smile served as a re- 
minder. Anson’s face reddened, 
due to a combination of embar- 
rassment and lipstick smudges, as 
he told Sue what had happened. 

Sue laughed. “Well, if that’s all 
it is, what are you so upset 
about?” Without waiting for a re- 
ply, she advanced upon the mana- 
ger, her hand digging into her 
middle bra-cup. “Here’s your to- 
kens,” she said. “Now call off the 
ejectors.” 

The manager accepted the 
disks with a smile of pure eu- 
phoria, then strode over to the 
robots and punched buttons. The 
ejectors halted their labors be- 
tween Reich and Stekel, then re- 
versed operations. Quickly and 
efficiently, they replaced all the 
books on the shelves.

In less than a minute, Anson 
faced the girl in privacy. “You 
shouldn’t have done that,” he said 
severely. 

“But, darling, I wanted to. After 
all, what are a few tokens more or 
less?” 

“A few tokens?” Anson scowled. 
“In the past year, I’ve borrowed 
over two thousand from you. This 
can’t go on.” 

“Of course not,” the girl agreed. 
“That’s what I’ve been telling you. 
Let’s get a Permanent and then 
Daddy will give you a nice fat 
job and — ” 

“There you go again! How 
often must I warn you about the 
Elektra situation? This unnatural 
dependency on the Father Image 
is dangerous. If only you’d let me 
get you down on the couch — ” 

“Why, of course, darling!” 

“No, no!” Anson cried. “I want 
to analyze you!” 

“Not now,” Sue answered. 
“We’ll be late for dinner. Daddy 
expects you.” 

“Damn dinner and damn Dad- 
dy, too,” Anson said. But he took 
the girl’s arm and left the office, 
contenting himself by slamming 
the door. 

“Aren’t you going to put up 
that Doctor Will Return in Two 
Hours sign?” the girl asked, glanc- 
ing back at the door. 

“No,” Anson told her. “I’m not 
coming back in two hours. Or 
ever.” 

36 



Sue gave him a puzzled look, 
but her eyes were smiling. 

F)R. HOWARD ANSON’S eyes 
weren’t smiling as he and 
Sue took off from the roof. He 
kept them closed, so that he didn’t 
have to watch the launching ro- 
bots, or note the ’copter’s progress 
as it soared above the city. He 
didn’t want to gaze down at the 
metallic tangle of conveyors mov- 
ing between the factories or the 
stiffly striding figures which su- 
pervised their progress on the 
ramps and loading platforms. The 
air about them was filled with 
’copters, homeward bound from 
offices and recreation areas, but 
no human figures moved in the 
streets. Ground-level was almost 
entirely mechanized. 

“What’s the matter now?” Sue’s 
voice made him look at her. Her 
eyes held genuine concern. 

“The sins of the fathers,” Anson 
said. “Yours and mine.” He 
watched the girl as she set the 
’copter on auto-pilot for the jour- 
ney across the river. “Of course 
it really wasn’t my father’s fault 
that he steered me into psychi- 
atry. After all, it’s been a family 
tradition for a hundred and fifty 
years. All my paternal ancestors 
were psychiatrists, with the excep- 
tion of one or two renegade Be- 
haviorists. When he encouraged 
my interest in the profession, I 
never stopped to question him.

He trained me — and I was the 
last student to take up the spe- 
cialty at medical school. The last, 
mind you! 

“I should have known then that 
it was useless. But he kept insist- 
ing this state of affairs couldn’t 
last, that things were sure to 
change. ‘Cheer up,’ he used to tell 
me, whenever I got discouraged. 
‘The pendulum is bound to swing 
in the other direction.!. And then 
he’d tell me about the good old 
days when he was a boy and the 
world was still full of fetichism 
and hebephrenia and pyromania 
and mixoscopic zoophilia. ‘It will 
come again,’ he kept telling me. 
‘Just you wait and see! We’ll have 
frottage and nympholepsy and 
compulsive exhibitionism — every- 
thing your little heart desires.’ 

“Well, he was wrong. He died 
knowing that he had set me up in 
a dead-end profession. I’m an 
anachronism, like the factory 
worker or the farmer or the miner 
or the soldier. We don’t have any 
need for them in our society any 
more; robots have replaced them 
all. And the End-Docs have re- 
placed the psychiatrists and 
neuro-surgeons. With robots to 
ease the physical and economic 
burden and gland-handers to re- 
lieve mental tension, there’s noth- 
ing left for me. The last psychi- 
atrist should have disappeared 
along with the last advertising 
man. Come to think of it, they 



probably belong together. My 
father was wrong, Sue. I know 
that now. But most of the real 
blame belongs to your father.” 
“Daddy?” she exclaimed. “How 
can you possibly blame him?” 

A NSON laughed shortly. “Your 
family has been pioneering in 
robotics almost as long as mine 
has worked in psychiatry. One of 
your ancestors took out the first 
basic patent. If it weren’t for him 
and those endocrine shots, every- 
thing would still be normal— lots 
of incest and scoptophilia, plenty 
of voyeurism for everybody — ” 
“Why, darling, what a thing to 
say! You know as well as I do 
what robots have done for the 
world. You said it yourself. We 
don’t have any more manual or 
menial labor. There’s no war, 
plenty of everything for every- 
body. And Daddy isn’t stopping 
there.” 

“I suppose not,” Anson said bit- 
terly. “What is the old devil 
dreaming up now?” 

Sue flushed. “You wouldn’t talk 
like that if you knew just how 
hard he’s been working. He and 
Mr. Mullet, the engineering chief. 
They’re just about ready to bring 
out the new pilot models they’ve 
developed for space travel.” 

“I’ve heard that one before. 
They’ve been announcing those 
models for ten years.” 

“They keep running into bugs,

I guess. But sooner or later, they’ll 
find a way to handle things. Noth- 
ing is perfect, you know. Every 
once in a while, there’s still some 
trouble with the more compli- 
cated models.” 

“But they keep trying for per- 
fection. Don’t you see where all 
this leads to, Sue? Human beings 
will become obsolescent. First the 
workers, now the psychiatrists and 
other professions. But it won’t end 
there. Inside of another genera- 
tion or two, we won’t need any- 
one any more. Your father, or 
somebody like him, will produce 
the ultimate robot — the robot 
that’s capable of building other 
robots and directing them. Come 
to think of it, he’s already done 
the first job; your factories are 
self-perpetuating. All we need 
now is a robot that can take the 
place of a few key figures like 
your father. Then that’s the end 
of the human race. Oh, maybe 
they’ll keep a few men and 
women around for pets, but that’s 
all. And thank God I won’t be 
here to see it.” 

“So why worry?” Sue replied. 
“Enjoy yourself while you can. 
We’ll apply for a Permanent and 
Daddy will give you a job like he 
promised me — ” 

“Job? What kind of job?” 

“Oh, maybe he’ll make you a 
vice-president or something. They 
don’t have to do anything.” 

“Fine! A wonderful future!” 



“I don’t see anything wrong 
with it. You ought to consider 
yourself lucky.” 

“Listen, Sue.” He turned to her 
earnestly. “You just don’t under- 
stand the way I feel. I’ve spent 
eighteen years of my life in 
school, six of it in training for my 
profession. That’s all I know and 
I know it well. And what have I 
to show for it? I’m a psychiatrist 
who’s never had a patient, a 
neuro-surgeon who’s never per- 
formed anything but an experi- 
mental topectomy or lobotomy. 
That’s my work, my life, and I 
want a chance to function. I don’t 
intend to sit around on a fat sine- 
cure, raising children whose only 
future is oblivion. I don’t want a 
Permanent with you under those 
conditions.” 

S UE SNIFFED petulantly. “A 
Permanent with me isn’t good 
enough, is that it? I suppose you’d 
rather have a lot of repression and 
guilt complexes and all that other 
stuff you’re always talking about.” 
“It isn’t that,” Anson insisted. 
“I don’t really want the world to 
revert to neurotic or psychotic 
behavior just so I can have a 
practice. But damn it, I can’t 
stand to see the way things are 
going. We’ve done away with 
stress and privation and tension 
and superstition and intolerance, 
and that’s great. But we’ve also 
done away with ourselves in the 



38 



GAtAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



process. We’re getting to the point 
where we, as human beings, no 
longer have a function to perform. 
We’re not needed.” 

The girl gave him an angry 
glance. “What you’re trying to say 
is that you don’t need me, is that 
it?” 

“I do need you. But not on 
these terms. I’m not going to lead 
a useless existence, or bring chil- 
dren into a world where they’ll be 
useless. And if your father brings 
up that vice-president deal at din- 
ner tonight, I’m going to tell him 
to take his job and — ” 

“Never mind!” Sue flipped the 
switch from auto-pilot back to 
manual and the ’copter turned. 
“You needn’t bother about dinner. 
I’ll take you back to your office 
now. You can put yourself down 
on the couch and do a little prac- 
ticing on your own mind. You 
need it! Of all the stupid, pig- 
headed — ” 

The sound of the crash reached 
them even at flying level. Sue 
Porter broke off abruptly and 
glanced down at the river front 
below. Anson stared with her. 

“What was that?” he asked. 

“I don’t know— can’t make it 
out from here.” She spun the con- 
trols, guiding the ’copter down 
until it hovered over a scene of 
accelerating confusion. 

A huge loading barge was 
moored against one of the docks. 
Had been moored, rather; as they 



watched, it swung erratically into 
the current, then banged back 
against the pier. Huge piles of 
machinery, only partially lashed 
to the deck, now tumbled and 
broke free. Some of the cranes 
splashed into the water and others 
rolled across the flat surface of 
the barge. 

“Accident,” Sue gasped. “The 
cable must have broken.” 

A NSON’S eyes focused on the 
metallic figures which dotted 
the deck and stood stolidly on the 
dock. “Look at the robots!” 

“What about them?” asked Sue. 
“Aren’t they supposed to be 
doing something? That one with 
the antenna — isn’t it designed to 
send out a warning signal when 
something goes wrong?” 

“You’re right. They beam Emer- 
gency in a case like this. The ex- 
pediters should be out by now.” 
“Some of them look as if they’re 
paralyzed,” Anson noted, observ- 
ing a half dozen of the metallic 
figures aboard the barge. They 
were rigid, unmoving. Even as he 
watched, a round steel bell bowled 
across the deck. None of the ro- 
bots moved — the sphere struck 
them like a ball hitting the pins 
and hurtled them into the water. 

On the pier, the immobilized 
watchers gave no indication of 
reaction. 

“Paralyzed,” Anson repeated. 
“Not that one!” 



DE AD-END DOCTOR

Sue pointed excitedly as the 
’copter hovered over the deck. 
Anson looked and found the cause 
of her consternation. 

A large, fully articulated robot 
with the humanoid face of a con- 
troller clattered along in a silvery 
blur of motion. From one of its 
four upper appendages dangled a 
broad-bladed axe. 

It bumped against an armless 
receptacle-type robot and the axe 
descended, striking the robot 
squarely in its loading compart- 
ment. There was a crash as the 
victim collapsed. 

And the controller robot sped 
on, striking at random, in a series 
of sped-up motions almost impos- 
sible to follow — but not impos- 
sible to understand. 

“That’s the answer!” said An- 
son. “It must have cut the cable 
with the axe. And attacked the 
others, to immobilize them. Come 
on, let’s land this thing.” 

“But we can’t go down there! 
It’s dangerous! Somebody will 
send out the alarm. The expedit- 
ers will handle it — ” 

“Land!” Anson commanded. He 
began to rummage around in the 
rear compartment of the ’copter. 

“What are you looking for?” 
Sue asked as she maneuvered the 
machine to a clear space along- 
side a shed next to the dock. 
“The rope ladder.” 

“But we won’t need it. We’re on 
the ground.” 

40 



“I need it.” He produced the 
tangled length and began to un- 
coil it. “You stay here,” he said. 
“This is my job.” 

“What are you going to do?” 

“Yes, what are you going to 
do?” The deep voice came from 
the side of the ’copter. Anson and 
Sue looked up at the face of 
Eldon Porter. 

“Daddy! How did you get 
here?” 

“Alarm came through.” 

HTHE BIG, gray-haired man 
scowled at the dock beyond, 
where the expediter robots were 
already mopping up with flame- 
throwers. 

“You’ve got no business here,” 
Eldon Porter said harshly. “This 
area’s off-limits until everything’s 
under control.” He turned to An- 
son. “And I’ll have to ask you to 
forget everything you’ve seen 
here. We don’t want word of acci- 
dents like these to leak out — just 
get people needlessly upset.” 

“Then this isn’t the first time?” 
asked Anson. 

“Of course not. Mullet’s had a 
lot of experience; he knows how 
to handle this.” 

“Right, Chief.” Anson recog- 
nized the thin, bespectacled engi- 
neer at Eldon Porter’s side. “Ev- 
ery time we test out one of these 
advanced models, something goes 
haywire. Shock, overload, some 
damned thing. Only thing we can 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



do is scrap it and try again. So 
you folks keep out of the way. 
We’re going to corner it with the 
flame-throwers and — ” 

“No!” 

Anson opened the door and 
climbed out, dragging the long 
rope ladder behind him. 

“Where in hell do you think 
you’re going?” demanded Eldon 
Porter. 

“I’m after that robot,” Anson 
said. “Give me two of your men 
to hold the ends of this ladder. 
We can use it like a net and cap- 
ture the thing without destroying 
it. That is, put it in restraint.” 

“Restraint?” 

“Technical term we psychi- 
atrists use.” Anson smiled at the 
two men and then at the girl. 
“Don’t worry,” he said. “I know 
what I’m doing. I’ve got a case at 
last. Your robot is psychotic.” 

“Psychotic?” grumbled Eldon 
Porter, watching the young man 
move away. “What’s that mean?” 

“Nuts,” said Sue sweetly. “A 
technical term.’ 

C EVERAL weeks passed before 
k ' Sue saw Dr. Howard Anson 
again. 

She waited anxiously outside 
in the corridor with her father 
until the young man emerged. He 
peeled off his gloves, smiling. 

“Well?” rumbled Eldon Porter. 

“Ask Mullet,” Anson suggested. 

“He did it!” the thin engineer 



exulted. “It works, just like he 
said it would! Now we can use the 
technique whenever there’s a 
breakdown. But I don’t think 
we’ll have any more. Not if we 
incorporate his suggestions in the 
new designs. We can use them on 
the new space pilot models, too.” 

“Wonderful!” Eldon Porter said. 
He put his hand on Anson’s shoul- 
der. “We owe you a lot.” 

“Mullet deserves the credit,” 
Anson replied. “If not for him and 
his schematics, I’d never have 
made it. He worked with me night 
and day, feeding me the informa- 
tion. We correlated everything — 
you know, I’d never realized how 
closely your engineers had fol- 
lowed the human motor-reaction 
patterns.” 

Eldon Porter cleared his throat. 
“About that job,” he began. “That 
vice-presidency — ” 

“Of course,” Anson said. “I’ll 
take it. There’s going to be a lot 
of work to do. I want to train at 
least a dozen men to handle emer- 
gencies until the new models take 
over. I understand you’ve had 
plenty of cases like this in the 
past.” 

“Right. And we’ve always 
ended up by junking the robots 
that went haywire. Hushed it up, 
of course, so people wouldn’t 
worry. Now we’re all set. We can 
duplicate the electronic patterns 
of the human brain without wor- 
rying about breakdowns due to

speedup or overload. Why didn’t 
we think of the psychiatric ap- 
proach ourselves?” 

“Leave that to me,” Anson said. 
And as the two men moved off, he 
made a psychiatric approach to- 
ward the girl. 

She finally stepped back out of 
his arms. “You owe me an ex- 
planation. What’s the big idea? 
You’re taking the job, after all!” 
“I’ve found I can be useful,” 
Anson told her. “There is a place 
for my profession — a big one. 
Human beings no longer go ber- 
serk, but robots do.” 

“Is that what this is all about? 
Have you been psychoanalyzing 
that robot you caught?” 

A NSON smiled. “I’m afraid 
psychoanalysis isn’t suitable 
for robots. The trouble is purely 
mechanical. But the brain is a 
mechanism, too. The more I 
worked with Mullet, the more I 
learned about the similarities.” 
other.” 

“You cured that robot in 
there?” she asked incredulously. 

“That’s right.” Anson slipped 
out of his white gown. “It’s as 
good as new, ready to go back on 
the job at once. Of course it will 
have slower, less intense reactions, 
but its judgment hasn’t been im- 
paired. Neuro-surgery did the 
trick. That’s the answer, Sue. Once 
you open them up, you can see 
the cure’s the same.” 



“So that’s why you were wear- 
ing a surgical gown,” she said. 
“You were operating on that 
robot.” 

Anson grinned triumphantly. 
“The robot was excited, in a state 
of hysteria. I merely applied my 
knowledge and skill to the prob- 
lem.” 

“But what kind of an opera- 
tion?” 

“I opened up the skull and 
eased the pressure on the over- 
load wires. There used to be a 
name for it, but now there’s a new 
one.” Anson took her back into his 
arms. “Darling, congratulate me! 
I’ve just successfully performed 
the first prefrontal robotomy!”

( Continued from page 4) 
one can be revived by praise — 
but my own curiosity has been 
momentarily stirred. 

Is science fiction literature, 
either with or without a capital 
“L”? I don’t know, but let’s see. 

The litmus commonly used to 
determine whether something is 
literature indicates its degree of 
success in depicting its era. I 
know that’s a sticky sentence, but 
it’s the kind of language critics 
hide behind. All it means is: did 
the author give you a sharp, vi- 
vid idea of what it was like to be 
alive in his time? 

Because science fiction deals 
mostly with the future and the 
past, alien planets, other dimen- 
sions and the like, it would seem 
to be out of bounds as literature, 
on the basis of this definition. 
How can you live vicariously in 
a writer’s era if he’s constantly 
going off somewhere else? 

Ah, but is he? The more he 
tells you of other times and 
places, the more he reveals of his 
own time and place. 

You can see that for yourself 
in the Utopias of the past; they 
display in surgical detail the con- 
ditions they aimed to correct. Not 
too oddly, I guess, we in the 
present can’t find much choice 
between those real and imaginary 
societies. The real ones were 
harsh and unjust, but so were the 
imaginary — they were sweet

setups for the authors and their 
friends, bum deals for everyone 
else. 

The gadgetry, too, tells us all 
we need to know of their science. 
Many of the ideas proved valid 

— distant communication, flight, 
ground and undersea travel, trans- 
mutation of metals, improved 
food raising and storage, teaching 
methods, publishing, recording 
sound for posterity — but they 
were unworkable because they 
were bound so immovably to the 
science of the day. 

In the same way, many of our 
ideas are valid, but if they come 
about as proposed, it will be a 
sheer accident. We also, of course, 
are limited by our knowledge. 
But it’s the idea that counts, not 
the execution — once the thought 
is expressed, the rest is up to the 
researchers. 

Science fiction does something 
that no other fiction can do. It 
provides a clear view of today, 
plus a sharp contrast between ex- 
trapolation and ultimate fact. A 
bonus like that should make sci- 
ence fiction LLiterature. Not all, 
by any means — no field of any 
kind can produce only master- 
pieces — but enough to meet the 
entrance examination.

THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE MOON 

T HE FULL Moon is hang- 
ing brightly over the At- 
lantic Ocean off the New 
Jersey shore and from this fact 
I derive for myself the right to 
reminisce a little. About thirty- 
five years ago — I was still in 
high school at the time — there 
was an astronomical exhibition in 
the old Urania Observatory in 
Berlin, the same observatory 
where the planetoid Eros had 
been tracked down. One of the 
items on display was a model of 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





the Moon, some sixteen inches 
in diameter, made in years of 
painstaking work by a retired 
teacher. A white-haired gentle- 
man in his seventies was talking 
to him and when he left, some- 
body said to me: “This gentle- 
man still knew Professor Hansen.” 
This would have been more in- 
structive by far if I had known at 
the time who Professor Hansen 
had been, but the name stuck in 
my mind and in due course I 
found out. 

Peter Andreas Hansen, to use 
his full name, had been the au- 
thor of a theory concerning the 
Moon. It was easily the most 
spectacular idea about the Moon 
anybody has ever had and it is 
almost sad that he was wrong. 
If Hansen had been right, science 
fiction authors would have a very 
nearly inexhaustible theme to 
play with and the first explora- 
tory round-the-Moon ships would 
really have something to watch 
for and photograph. 

T HE WESTERN world began 
to realize that the Moon is 
an independent solid body in 
space at about the time of Christ. 
What people thought before that 
time is only imperfectly known; 
my guess is that most of them 
managed to do without any spe- 
cific ideas. 

Pliny the Elder mentioned in 
his famous Natural History that 




“the ancients” thought the Moon 
was a round silver shield in the 
sky. But there was disagreement 
about the nature of the spots that 
could be so clearly seen. One un- 
known philosopher declared that 
they were just dirt, atmospheric 
vapors which had condensed on 
the shiny silver. Another equally 
unknown philosopher held that 
no vapors had sullied the splen- 
dor of the heavenly disk, but that 
the spots one could see were re- 
flections of the continents and 
seas of the Earth below. 

One might study the geography 
of the Earth by looking at the 
Moon. The really difficult prob- 
lem was to find out where the 
observer himself was located in 
this reflection. 

Another early idea is embodied 
in a Hindu legend. According to 
it, the Moon was the round face 
of a lantern carried by a gigan- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



45 




Kepler's Second Law. The areas swept 
over the radius vector must be equal 
for equal times. In a circular orbit 
P. 45 , the angles would be equal/ too. 
In an elliptical orbit (right), they are 
decidely unequal 

tic (and invisible) Heavenly 
Watchman. 

In the classical West, as I have 
mentioned, the Moon was recog- 
nized as a “second Earth” some 
two thousand years ago. It was 
understood that the Moon was 
considerably smaller than Earth, 
but this was taken to be the main 
or even the only dissimilarity. 
Like the Earth, it indubitably had 
continents and seas, mountains 
and valleys, rivers and forests. 
These ideas are still reflected 
in the astronoomical names for 
some of the lunar features. The 
largest of the dark blotches is 
still called Oceanus procellarum, 
the Ocean of Storms. Another fea- 



ture is still spoken of as the Sinus 
iridum, the Rainbow Bay, and 
another section is labeled Palus 
nebularum, the Misty Swamp. 

When Galileo Galilei looked at 
the Moon, he still thought he saw 
seas and continents, but it needed 
only slight improvements of the 
early telescopes to realize that the 
“seas” could not be seas. And 
familiarity with the surface of the 
Moon quickly convinced the ob- 
server that he could always see 
everything there was to be seen, 
that his vision was never ob- 
scured by lunar cloud patches. 
The astronomers of the first half 
of the seventeenth century might 
not yet be able to make up their 
minds on whether there was an 
atmosphere on the Moon or not, 
but they could tell that it was a 
cloudless atmosphere. 

Later in the same century, the 
case was already decided. The 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Dutch astronomer and mathema- 
tician Christian Huyghens, who 
died in 1695, stated it categoric- 
ally in his book Cosmotheoros: 
“on the Moon, there are no seas, 
no rivers, nor clouds, nor air and 
water.” The same book, incident- 
ally, contains the statement that 
the moons of Jupiter and of Sa- 
turn always turn the same side 
to their planets, just as our moon 
does with us. 

T^OR A layman, Huyghens’ ver- 
diet may well have dispelled 
whatever interest he had had in 
the Moon before. As far as astron- 
omers were concerned, their work 
was just beginning. The first and 
most obvious and incidentally 
rather tedious job was a complete 
mapping of the visible hemi- 
sphere. If any changes should 
take place on the lunar surface, 
one had to have a detailed map 



to recognize them. 

While they were at it, astron- 
omers began to realize that our 
moon is extraordinary in size. 
The Earth-Moon system is al- 
most a double planet, something 
we know to be theoretically pos- 
sible, even though our own solar 
system happens not to offer an 
example. True, our moon is not 
the largest satellite in the Solar 
System. Its diameter of 2160 
miles is surpassed by three of 
the four large moons of Jupiter 
(namely by Io, Ganymede and 
Callisto), by Titan, the largest of 
Saturn’s moons, and by Triton, 
the larger of the two known 
moons of Neptune. 

But while Triton has a di- 
ameter of around 3000 miles, the 
diameter of its planet is 26,800 
miles. Earth’s diameter is a little 
over 7900 miles, so that the di- 
ameter of our moon is, in round

°Rbit 






The extreme positions above end below the ecliptic the Moon can assume, 
permitting a look over its poles 



figures, one-quarter of the di- 
ameter of the planet to which it 
belongs. Still, the Earth-Moon 
system is not quite a double planet 
because the common center of 
gravity of the system is still in- 
side the body of the Earth, about 
1000 miles below the surface. 

Although nobody ever ex- 
perienced any trouble locating 
the Moon in the sky, provided it 
was visible at all, the calculation 
of the Moon’s orbit happens to 
be a very difficult job. One might 
say that any perturbation of its 
movement that is possible at all 
actually does take place. For 
quite some time, astronomers 
looked for some unknown factor 
influencing the Moon’s movement. 
And this is the point where Pro- 
fessor Peter Andreas Hansen en- 
tered the picture. 

Hansen had been born in Den- 
mark exactly one hundred years 
after Huyghens died in Holland. 
Before he became an astronomer, 
he had been an instrument 
maker, but he became involved 
in an astronomical venture — 

48 



the measuring of a meridian. He 
was working at Altona Observa- 
tory then, but only a few years 
later, in 1825, he was offered the 
position as director of the See- 
berg Observatory. 

Hansen’s special interest was 
the computation of orbits and he 
was fascinated by the perturba- 
tions of orbits. Small wonder that 
he tackled the problem of the or- 
bit of the Moon. While working 
at it, he thought one day that he 
had spotted that unknown factor 
other astronomers had been talk- 
ing about. Much could be ex- 
plained if one assumed that the 
Moon was not a perfect sphere. 

COURSE many planets are 
not perfect spheres. Every- 
body knows that the Earth has 
a rather marked equatorial bulge. 
And Jupiter’s equatorial bulge is 
so enormous that it can be seen 
with even a small telescope. But 
this is not what Hansen meant 
when he said that the Moon was 
not a perfect sphere. 

He did not think of equatorial 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




bulges and flattened poles. The 
idea was rather that the Moon 
was slightly egg-shaped, that it 
had two equatorial diameters, 
one when measured from rim to 
rim of the visible disk and another 
and larger one when measured 
from the center of the visible 
disk to the center of the hemi- 
sphere, which is invisible from 
Earth. 

Instead of having an equator- 
ial bulge all around the equator, 
like a quickly rotating planet, 
the Moon, in Hansen’s opinion, 
had a large equatorial bulge in 
only one spot, something like an 
enormous high plateau, large 
enough to accommodate whole 
mountain chains and deep valleys. 
The center of this enormous bulge 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



was supposed to coincide with 
the center of the visible disk of 
the Moon. In fact, all we could 
see from Earth was just this 
bulge, for the Moon’s longer 
equatorial diameter was lined 
up with the common center of 
gravity of the Earth-Moon sys- 
tem. 

If this was true, it not only 
explained the observed peculiari- 
ties in the Moon’s orbital motion; 
it also shed an entirely new light 
on everything else that had been 
observed. If the visible lunar disk 
was an enormous mountainous 
plateau, lifted to stratospheric 
heights, the observed absence of 
air and of water was only the logi- 
cal result of such elevation. There 
was no observable air because the 

49 



plateau was above the denser 
layers of the Moon’s atmosphere. 
And there could be no water be- 
cause it had run off the bulge 
thousands or millions of years ago. 

It followed that no observa- 
tion that had been made could 
be applied to the unknown hemi- 
sphere of the Moon. The most 
thorough knowledge of the Sahara 
Desert does not enable you to 
construct a picture of India or of 
Mexico just because they lie in 
the same latitudes. The Moon’s 
other hemisphere probably did 
have an atmosphere and probably 
did have water. And where there 
are air and water, there are prob- 
ably plants. And where there are 
plants, the presence of animals 
can be predicted with a fair 
chance of being right, because 
animal life is parasitic on plant 
life. 

Nor did you have to stop along 
this chain of reasoning at this 
point. If there are animals, some 
of them will start preying on 
other animals after a while and 
become carnivorous. And some of 
them might become intelligent in 
time and represent what older 
poets had called the “selenites,” 
the inhabitants of the Moon. 

H ANSEN’S colleagues listened 
with much respect because 
he was a deservedly famous as- 
tronomer. They listened with the 
greatest of interest, too, because 

50 



it was a fascinating and novel 
idea. The next problem was to 
find out whether it was also true. 
Continued observation was still 
the means of doing it because na- 
ture had provided some help in 
the form of the phenomenon of 
libration. 

I feel that I should digress 
from the main theme at this point 
for a fuller explanation of this 
phenomenon which, as I know 
from correspondence I receive 
from readers, is not well under- 
stood by many. As is generally 
known, the Moon turns around 
its axis in the same number of 
days and hours as it needs to go 
around the Earth once. It is as 
if you had a man walking around 
you in a circle, looking rigidly in 
the direction in which he is walk- 
ing. That way, he turns around 
his own axis once every time he 
circles you and all you can ob- 
serve is his left profile, with his 
left ear roughly in the center of 
what you can see of his head. 

Well, if this is the case, what 
is libration and how does it enter 
into the picture? The proper an- 
swer is that it is caused by the 
fact that the Moon does not move 
around the Earth in a circle but 
on an elliptical orbit. 

To explain this, let us first see 
what the Moon does not do (Fig. 
1). Namely, it does not move 
around the Earth in a circle. Such 
a circular path is shown on the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



left in the diagram. If the Moon 
did move in a circular path, it 
would need precisely the same 
time to go from A to B as it 
would need to go from C to D. 
In reality, the orbit is elliptical, 
as shown with great exaggeration 
on the right in the diagram. Again 
it needs as much time to go from 
A to B as it does to go from C to 
D. 

The sections of the orbit trav- 
eled are of markedly different 
length; what counts is that the 
shaded areas formed by the lines 
from the center of the Moon to 
the common center of gravity are 
equal. Technically, such a line 
from center to center is known 
as the radius vector and Kepler’s 
Second Law states that the radius 
vector must sweep over equal 
areas in equal times. 

When the Moon is closest to 
the Earth — in perigee, as it is 
called — it moves faster than 
when it is farthest away, or in 
apogee. Logically, then, since the 
areas covered by the radius vec- 
tor have to be equal for equal 
times, the portions of the orbit 
traversed cannot be of equal 
length. The customary statement 
that the average velocity of the 
Moon is 0.65 miles per second is, 
of course, true, but the word 
“average” must not be overlooked. 
Actually, the Moon is faster than 
that in perigee and slower in 
apogee. 



Before going on to the next 
step of the explanation, let me 
give the actual figures: The far- 
thest apogee possible is 252,710 
miles; the nearest possible peri- 
gee is 221,463 miles, both meas- 
ured from the center of the 
Earth to the center of the Moon. 
The surface-to-surface distance 
is, of course, 5000 miles less. 

K EEPING in mind that the 
velocity of the Moon along 
its orbit is not uniform, we only 
have to realize that the rate of. 
rotation around its axis must be 
uniform to see what happens (Fig. 
2). Both at apogee and at peri- 
gee, the same spot on the Moon 
— marked by a short line — 
forms the center of the visible 
disk. 

But this spot is not in the cen- 
ter at intermediate positions. 
One might say that the rotation 
of the Moon lags somewhat be- 
hind its orbital motion for one- 
half of the orbit and is some- 
what ahead of it for the other 
half. And if the spot which is in 
the center at apogee, and perigee 
is off center in between, it is ob- 
vious that a portion of what was 
visible, say, in apogee disappears 
from view over the left rim, while 
another previously invisible por- 
tion comes into view over the 
right rim. 

This is part of what is called 
libration. The other part is caused 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



51 



by the fact that the Moon’s orbit 
is slightly tilted as compared to 
the orbit of the Earth around the 
Sun, the ecliptic (Fig. 3). Depend- 
ing on the position at the moment, 
we can sometimes peep over the 
lunar north pole into the area be- 
yond, and sometimes over the lu- 
nar south pole. 

The overall result is that, in 
the course of a number of years, 
we can see and map a total of 59 
per cent of the lunar surface. Only 
4 1 per cent of it is completely un- 
known and will remain so until 
the films taken by the first cir- 
cumlunar rocket come out of the 
developer. 

But a total of 59 per cent was 
enough to disprove Hansen’s in- 
triguing idea. If he had been right, 
we should have caught an oc- 
casional glimpse of the “low- 
lands,” especially when looking 
over the poles. Moreover, at 
periods of maximum libration, 
the unusual shape of the Moon 
should be apparent to some de- 
gree to direct vision. 

A FTER two decades of inten- 
sive research — much of it 
carried out by Simon Newcomb 
in Washington — all astronomers 
were agreed that Hansen’s as- 
sumption did not conform with 
reality. Since the whole episode 
had taken place at a time when 
science fiction novels were few 
and far between, Professor Han- 

52 



sen’s egg-shaped Moon was not 
exploited literarily. 

With just one exception, that 
is, hut this exception was written 
in Polish. It appeared decades af- 
ter the idea had been abandoned 
in science, namely, half a century 
ago. 

Its title was On Silvery Plains 
and the name of its author was 
Jerczy von Zulawsky. In the story, 
two or three ships, carrying cab- 
ins that can be used like automo- 
biles, land near the center of the 
visible hemisphere of the Moon 
and then start the long trek 
“downhill” to the jungle of the 
lowlands. Near the end of his 
life, the leader of the expedition 
goes back in one of the automo- 
bile cabins to the place of the 
original landing where a mortar 
has been left behind to shoot the 
expedition’s report back to 
Earth. The novel, of course, was 
supposed to be this report. 

Since I last read the book in 
about 1928, I may have forgot- 
ten some details, but it seems to 
me that Hansen’s name was not 
mentioned in it. Jerczy von Zulaw- 
sky probably never saw the orig- 
inal papers but received his in- 
spiration from a second or third 
hand popular account in a gen- 
eral magazine or newspaper sup- 
plement. 

Well, how does the other side 
of the Moon look? 

The answer is: probably not 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



very different from the side we 
can see from Earth. What ap- 
pears at the rim when the libra- 
tion is favorable are the same 
types of formations so well known 
to astronomers. There are a num- 
ber of craters, some of them quite 
large, a mountain range or two, 
and the edges of some mare 
plains. 

Interestingly enough, we know 
the approximate locations of at 
least three craters that are deeply 
hidden in the inaccessible 4 1 
per cent of the lunar surface. 
These craters have systems of 
“rays” as we know them from 
Tycho and Copernicus on the 
visible hemisphere. 

On “our” side, all “ray” sys- 
tems originate from large cra- 
ters and the “rays” themselves 
are great circle lines. It is com- 
paratively unimportant in this 
connection that we don’t know 
the nature of the “rays” and have 
no idea of why some craters have 
them and others do not. What is 
important is that the “rays” from 
beyond the rim indicate the ex- 
istence and locations of several 
large craters. 

Some British astronomers have 
postulated that the unknown 
hemisphere may differ in degree 
from the known hemisphere, even 
though they must be fundament- 
ally alike. They think that the 
unknown hemisphere contains a 
lesser number of craters and con- 



sists mostly of large mare plains. 
This reasoning is built, however, 
upon a foundation of hypotheses 
which, at the moment, are be- 
yond either proof or disproof. 

The only suggestion one can 
make here is to have patience. 
In about 20 years, if not earlier, 
we’ll be able to look at films 
and see what the other side ac- 
tually looks like. 

SIC TRANSIT 

A S A result of the discussion 
of the “transits” of Venus 
across the Sun’s disk, I received 
a number of letters from readers 
who wanted to know a lot of 
things I had failed to mention 
since, after all, my article did not 
concern transits specifically. The 
questions ranged all the way 
from requests for a table of Venus 
transits to inquiries about rules 
for transits of Mercury. 

Because Mercury moves 
around the Sun in a much shorter 
time than Venus, a Mercury tran- 
sit is a much more frequent phe- 
nomenon than a Venus transit. 
It can occur only in May and in 
November and the number of 
years between one transit and the 
next follows the sequence 13 — 
7 _ 10 — 3 — 10 — 3, a total 
of 46 years. The cycle then re- 
peats. 

Table I shows the transits 
which took place or will take

53 



place during the 19th and 20th 
centuries, with an additional en- 
try for the next century because 
the last transit of the 20th cen- 
tury will be a mere grazing of 
the Sun’s limb — almost a near 
miss, so to speak. 

As regards Venus transits, they 
are listed on Table II and be- 
cause they are so rare, we can 
cover a time interval of several 
centuries. Taking further strides 
in the medical sciences for 
granted, I hope that at least half

fire which burned in that daunt- 
less pioneer — ” Speech by Hon. 
J. Farnsworth Willisgate, Martian 
Representative, in United Na- 
tions Assembly, 14 May 2247 

T^VERYBODY in Syrtis turned 
out when the Fleet arrived, 
and those who could traveled 
from as far as Yellowpeak and 
Whatsit for the occasion. A fair 
sprang up overnight, tents and 
booths sprawling over dusty 
miles, carnivals, migratory shows 
both live and recorded, noise and 
bustle and cheer. The alcohol 
plants and the fun houses did a 

55 



rush business and you couldn’t 
get a hotel room for love, money 
or good sweet water. Some folk 
even had to break the law and 
camp in the ruins, the long ex- 
tinct native race sheltering a new, 
non-furry breed of Martian. 

Laslos Magarac threaded past 
the crowds till he got to the 
spaceport fence. He had an im- 
pulse to pay a dollar to one of 
the telescope concessionaires for 
a look at the fifty great ships 
orbiting around the planet, but 
decided against it — the line was 
too long. After all, twice a local 
year was about once an Earth- 
year, so it was a capitalized Event 
— but the shuttle boats blasting 
down, sheeting flame through 
clouds of kicked-up red dust, 
were spectacular enough. 

There was one arriving now, 
descending on a tail of fire some 
four miles away — which put it 
almost on the horizon. It was a 
bright gleam against the dark- 
blue sky, under the shrunken sun. 
As he watched, it entered its 
cradle and was wheeled off to- 
ward the waiting electrotrucks. 
Unloading began immediately; 
the trucks gulped packages and 
scurried like beetles toward the 
warehouses. Mail, merchandise, 
tools and luxuries — it was like a 
friendly greeting from old Earth. 

Another line of vehicles was 
chuffing toward an empty shuttle 
with boxed and baled Martian 



goods, mostly drybean extract 
with a scattering of jewels, hopper 
pelts and prehistoric relics. The 
Fleet had to work fast, deliver its 
cargo and get loaded and start 
home again in a few days. 

Magarac found a place in the 
post office line and resigned him- 
self to waiting an hour. He was 
a somewhat dehydrated-looking 
man with a gaunt ugly face and 
dry black hair. The coverall 
which protected him from the 
late-afternoon chill was the stand- 
ard Martian garment, but as a 
well-to-do planter, he bore an ex- 
pensive cloak patterned like a 
rainbow. 

“Ah . impatient, I see, my 
friend.” 

Magarac turned around. Oliver 
Latourelle had joined the queue 
behind him. The physicist was a 
well-nourished man with a plump, 
sharp-nosed face, watery blue 
eyes and bushy white hair fring- 
ing an egg-shaped skull. “Is it that 
you await mail from a fair one 
back on Earth?” 

“Not any more,” said Magarac 
gloomily. “Three Mars-years was 
too long to wait.” 

T ATOURELLE clicked his 
tongue in sympathy. “The old 
tale, no? You are going to Mars 
to raise drybeans and make a 
fortune. But it takes long to be- 
come rich, even in the Dominion, 
and meanwhile the radio beams 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



are too public and first-class mail 
is ten dollars an ounce.” 

“I’m doing okay,” said Magarac 
defensively. “On Mars, that is. 
The trouble is that passage home 
would eat up half my money.” 
He didn’t like to discuss his per- 
sonal affairs, but when there are 
barely 10,000 people on an en- 
tire planet, privacy hardly exists. 

“Be consoled,” advised Latour- 
elle. “I speak as a man of experi- 
ence. No one ever died of a 
broken heart. That organ is 
capable of miraculously rapid 
self-repair. The secret is to give 
it time to do so.” 

“Oh, I’m long over that busi- 
ness,” said Magarac. “What I’m 
anxious to find out is how syn- 
thetic chemistry is progressing on 
Earth.” 

“So? I realize that to operate 
a plantation here requires a good 
scientific background, but are you 
so vitally interested that you can- 
not wait until your mail is de- 
livered?” 

“I am,” said Magarac. “And 
so is all Mars, whether they know 
it or not. Eighty per cent of our 
industry is based on the drybean. 
It won’t grow anywhere else, and 
they’re finding new medicinal 
uses for the extract every year. 
But figure it out for yourself. 
Freight rates being what they are, 
the stuff costs fifty dollars an 
ounce by the time the Earth doc- 
tor gets it. Every chemical firm 

THE CORKSCREW OF SPACE 



you can name has a team trying 
to synthesize the basic molecule. 
One day soon, they’re going to 
do it and then the drybean plant- 
ers are finished. I'm watching the 
technical journals so I can sell 
out in time.” 

“And what will you do then, 
with the Dominion broke?” 

“God only knows.” 

“And I thank Him I was born 
to be a research physicist, and 
I thank the Rockefeller Founda- 
tion for so generously subsidiz- 
ing my work,” said Latourelle. 
“Though with all respect to this 
excellent planet of yours, my 
friend, it seems a long and dry 
three years ahead until I can 
return to France.” He had arrived 
with the Fleet before last, but 
even if he finished ahead of sched- 
ule, he would have to wait his 
turn for passage. 

“What d’you have to be here 
for, anyway?” asked Magarac. He 
had gotten quite friendly with 
Latourelle, but knew little of the 
man’s highly specialized project. 

“I am studying magnetism. 
Mars, you see, does not have a 
core like Earth, but is of uniform 
composition. Apparently that ac- 
counts for its peculiar magnetic 
field ... Yet in what way? I 
think it is an effect of relativistic 
wave mechanics. I have devel- 
oped a most beautiful theory of 
Riemannian folds in a multiply 
connected space. Now I am check- 

57 



ing the magnetic data to see if 
my theory will hold — you pardon 
the expression — water.” 

“And so what’s your hurry 
to get your mail?” Magarac 
chuckled. “A gorgeous dame of 
your own?” 

“No. Not that I am too old 
even now, I assure you, but I have 
more sense than to expect a de- 
lectable woman to wait five 
Earth-years for my return. I shall 
simply start afresh. No, no, my 
friend, it is that I have been ex- 
travagant with myself. Well, say 
rather that I am supplying a ne- 
cessity. If you would care to visit 
my house tonight for a little 
private discussion — ?” 

And Latourelle would say 
nothing more. With elaborate 
silence, he picked up a large 
wooden case at the desk, and 
Margarac’s last sight of him was 
a small suspicious figure hugging 
the box to his chest and stumping 
off toward Syrtis. 

r | 'HE NEWS, no doubt, was 
good for humanity at large, 
but it would hit Mars heavily. 
Magarac had been an engineer 
on Earth, with added experience 
in chemistry, and could read be- 
tween the lines. M’Kato an- 
nounced cautiously that he 
thought he had the structural 
formula of protenzase. If he was 
right, they would be synthesizing 
it in another year. Quite prob- 
58 



ably, the next Fleet would not 
be accepting drybean extract. 

Magarac slouched gloomily 
away from the lights and music 
and swirl of the fair. What the 
devil was a man to do? 

So far, the history of Mars had 
been economic history. The first 
colony had been planted to mine 
the rich uranium beds of the 
Aetheria. To save freight, it had 
had to be made self-sufficient; 
and, since this was not Periclean 
Greece, it had had to include 
women. Children resulted and 
drybean culture provided a new 
source of income ... so good a 
source that Mars stopped ship- 
ping uranium and used it instead 
to break down iron oxides and 
produce a breathable atmosphere. 

Now they were the Dominion, 
with junior status in the UN, and 
talked big about gaining full self- 
government. 

But when their economy was 
kicked in the stomach — 

Magarac found Solis Avenue 
deserted. Only a few early re- 
turnees like himself, and the 
puritan isolationists who had not 
gone to the fair at all, were in 
town. He walked along the street 
between the flat-roofed stone 
houses of a rainless, timberless 
world. Overhead glittered a night 
of splendid stars, but he missed 
the Moon. Phobos and Deimos 
weren’t worth writing home 
about.

He sighed and took out a ciga- 
rette and winced as he lit it. Syn- 
thetic tobacco, synthetic alcohol, 
synthetic steaks . God! Maybe 
he ought to throw in his hand and 
go back to Earth. 

Only he liked it here. There 
was room in the deserts and the 
equatorial moors. A man was still 
a man, not a number. You worked 
with your hands and brain, for 
yourself, and making -a* time- 
gnawed sandstone waste blossom 
green was more satisfying than 
punching a clock in an Earthside 
factory. He wanted to get married 
and fill his ranch house with kids 
and raise them up proud of being 
Martians and Magaracs. 

He turned a corner and 
emerged on Matsuoko Plaza. 
The thin air carried sound so 
poorly that he was almost on the 
rally before he realized. 

T T WAS the man himself, rant- 

ing from the balcony of Bar- 
soom House. Magarac had to ad- 
mit the demagogue had person- 
ality — a thick-set, dynamic type, 
with a fierce head that he was 
always tossing dramatically back, 
a voice which was organ and 
trumpet and bass drum. What the 
planter did not like was the 
words, or the crowd, or the green- 
shirted goons stationed around 
the square. 

“ — And I say to you, it was 
hard work, hard work and obedi- 

60 



ence which made the glorious 
vision of our grandfathers into the 
reality you see about you, which 
transformed a planetwide deso- 
lation into a world of men! It was 
thrift and sobriety. Yes, let me 
say it was intolerance — intoler- 
ance of vice, of drink, of laziness 
and rebelliousness against consti- 
tuted authority, which made us 
what we now are. 

“Then let us be intolerant! 
These self-styled democrats, these 
Earth-lovers, with their hell- 
brewed liquor and their loose 
women and their hair-splitting 
Bill of Rights designed only to 
thwart the Will of the People, 
will ruin us if they can. It is 
we who Believe who must save 
the destiny of Mars — ” 

Magarac shrank into a dark 
corner. The mob numbered al- 
most a hundred men, shoving and 
yelling in an ugly mood, and 
Magarac was no friend of Bla- 
lock’s Freeman Party. As an 
assemblyman of Syrtis District, 
he had often spoken publicly 
against him. 

Freeman! Haw! And all the 
horses laughed. And all the horses’ 
donkeys laughed. It was the old 
story, the would-be dictator, ap- 
pealing to that queer deep streak 
of masochistic puritanism in the 
Martian culture. The first colon- 
ists had needed such traits, to 
nerve them for their heartbreak- 
ing job. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



But now — good Lord! Wasn’t 
it about time Mars became civi- 
lized? 

How it happened, Magarac was 
never sure. One minute, Blalock 
was talking himself beserk and 
the crowd was crying amen; the 
next minute, they were across the 
plaza, tearing Cassidy’s Bar & 
Grill apart. 

Cassidy was the most inoffen- 
sive little man in the Solar Sys- 
tem, who often apologized for the 
rotgut he had to sell and the 
prices he had to charge. Martian 
beer was just barely preferable 
to none at all, though it cost as 
much as champagne would on 
Earth, and Cassidy operated a 
friendly neighborhood pub where 
men could shed the grinding 
sameness of desert reclamation in 
a few hours of conviviality. 
Magarac not only liked the place 
and its owner, but figured they 
were important to keeping the 
town sane. 

When he saw glass splinter as 
two six-foot bruisers tossed Cas- 
sidy through his own window, 
and when he saw the whole in- 
vestment smashed and running 
out in the street, Laslos Magarac 
decided that if Blalock had in- 
timidated the police, the skunk 
ought to be shown there was still 
one man left in Syrtis. 

A man, by God! 

He ran across the square and 
started swinging. 



f ATOURELLE opened the 
door and stood uncertainly. 
“But what happened to you, my 
friend? You look like one of the 
old Martian ruins.” 

“Just a ruined Martian.” Maga- 
rac lurched into the house and 
headed for the bathroom. 

“Use the whole week’s water 
ration if you desire,” said Latour- 
elle anxiously. “Me, I am not 
drinking water any more.” 

He hovered about trying to 
be helpful while Magarac got 
washed and patched. Apart from 
a missing tooth, the damage was 
only skin deep and a glass of 
analgesite took away the pain. It 
was with a sigh almost of con- 
tentment that Magarac finally 
stretched out in a battered easy 
chair. 

Latourelle’s house consisted of 
three rooms: bath, living-dining- 
sleeping, and a laboratory. The 
lab took up most of the space. 
But with his genius for being 
comfortable, the Frenchman had 
made his home a place of cheer. 

“When the assembly meets 
next week, they’re going to get 
an earful,” said Magarac. “Not 
that it’ll do any good. Blalock’s 
bullies have everybody else 
cowed. But you shoulda seen the 
other guy.” He smiled dreamily, 
with bruised and swelling lips. 
“Four of ’em was one too many 
for me, but they won’t forget me 
in a hurry.” 



THE CORKSCREW OF SPACE

“I take it, then, you had the 
run-in with the Freemen?” 
“They were busting up Cas- 
sidy’s tavern. I dragged him away 
and called a doctor. He’ll be all 
right.” 

“Barbarians! Have they no con- 
sideration for others?” 

“Not the Freemen. They want 
to march around in fancy uni- 
forms and so they figure every- 
body else ought to want the 
same.” Magarac scowled and 
lighted a cigarette. His fingers 
shook a little. “Ollie, Mars is really 
sick.” 

“It must be, if this sort of thing 
is proceeding unhindered.” 

“We’re out of touch with his- 
tory. What can we do but stag- 
nate, when you have to work a 
lifetime to save up enough money 
for one vacation on Earth? Bla- 
lock would be laughed out of 
town back there. But here he’s a 
big frog because the whole planet 
is such a small puddle. And life 
is so grim at best that the shoddy 
excitement he can offer appeals 
to the young men.” 

Magarac spoke fast, with the 
feverish loquacity of weariness. 
“We have to live ascetically be- 
cause of economics. So, sooner or 
later, we’re going to rationalize 
that fact and turn ascetism from 
an unpleasant necessity to a 
shining virtue.” He puffed hard, 
seeking comfort from the vile 
fake tobacco. “When that hap- 

62 



pens, Mars will no longer be fit 
to live on.” 

“It is not now, I fear,” said 
Latourelle. 

“Sure, it still is, because we 
have hope. We can work and hope 
to improve the place. But if Bla- 
lock gets into power, there won’t 
even be that hope.” 

f^nPHESE things, they come 
and go,” said Latourelle 
fatalistically. “The beast will have 
his day and then be forgotten.” 

“Not when the bottom is going 
to be knocked out of our economy 
— which will happen pretty soon. 
Then everybody will be desper- 
ate enough to try the old panacea, 
the Almighty State.” Magarac’s 
face twisted. “And we could do 
so much, Ollie, if we had the 
chance! We have minerals, we 
have space for agriculture . and 
Earth is getting so overcrowded, 
someday it’ll be desperate for 
food. But the damned cost of 
shipping! The time it takes! If 
we had a fast, cheap method of 
space travel, we could shuck this 
lopsided drybean economy, build 
up diversified industries, turn 
Mars into an Eden.” 

“One cannot very well argue 
with a gravitational potential dif- 
ference,” shrugged Latourelle. 

“No, but a rocket is such a slow 
and wasteful way to overcome 
it.” Magarac looked wistful. “And 
if we had something better, we’d 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



be in close touch with Earth. 
We’d have a living culture to 
nourish us — books, music, art, 
everything Man needs to be more 
than just a two-legged belly.” 

“Well, be of good heart, my 
friend. In another fifty or a hun- 
dred years such a method will 
be available.” 

“Hm?” Magarac looked up 
through two black eyes. “What 
d’you mean?” 

“Did you not know? Bieri, I 
suppose not; you are no theo- 
retical physicist. But if my con- 
cept of warped space is valid, 
then it should be entirely pos- 
sible to — well, yes, to bring a 
spaceship directly from the sur- 
face of Mars to the surface of 
Earth, or vice versa, in the wink 
of an eye, at negligible cost. The 
ship would^ follow a geodesic 
through the appropriate fold in 
space — ” 

Magarac jumped to his feet. 
“You don’t mean it!” 

“But I do.” Latourelle beamed. 
“There, is not that consolation to 
you?” 

“No,” said Magarac bleakly. 
“Fifty years will be too late. Mars 
will have been ruined in a dec- 
ade.” He leaned over and gripped 
Latourelle’s shoulders. “D’you^ 
think you can build such a ship 
now?” 

“What do you think I am? A 
sorcerer?” 

“I know you’re a Nobel Prize 



winner, a genuine genius and—” 

“And an old tired man who will 
in a few years return to his be- 
loved valley of the Dordogne and 
sit on a vine-covered terrace and 
sip a glass of Medoc. Shall we say 
a Pouillac?” Latourelle smiled 
wistfully. “I cannot produce mir- 
acles to order.” 

“You’ve done it, blast you! 
That neutron recycler of yours — ” 

“That was to prove a point 
which interested me. My heart 
goes out to you, but up here — ” 
Latourelle tapped his gleaming 
forehead — “up here is a selfish 
animal, the subconscious mind, 
which must first be given an all- 
important motive before it will 
work. And as I am only to be 
on Mars three more years, I have 
no such motive.” 

1%/f AGAR AC slumped back in 
-L”-®- his chair. “Yeah . yeah, 
I guess so.” 

“Come on to Earth,” urged 
Latourelle. “Come to France and 
I will show you how to live. You 
poor Martians must wolf your 
tasteless synthetics and gulp your 
miserable beer and try to per- 
suade yourselves you are still 
human. It is no wonder that pro- 
hibitionism is growing. This Bla- 
lock now, if he could ever taste a 
properly prepared mousse of shad 
roe, with a Barsac — no, let us say 
a Puligny Montrachet — ah, he 
would realize that there are 



THE CORKSCREW OF SPACE 



63 



higher values than his own ambi- 
tion and that the goodness of 
God is a more alive thing than 
the cold charity of the State.” 

Magarac braced himself. He 
liked Latourelle, but the old fel- 
low was a bore on this one topic. 

“I have given some thought to 
my first menu,” went on the physi- 
cist raptly. “I cannot now specify 
the vintages, for I have lost touch, 
but give me time when I return, 
give me time. We will begin, of 
course, with a light dry sherry. 
There are those who maintain 
the virtues of vermouth as an 
aperitif, but not just before a 
meal, if you please. After the 
appetizers and the clear soup, 
there will be the fish and the 
white Burgundy of which I 
spoke.” 

He was almost crooning now. 
‘‘With the tournedos, we will 
serve Bordeaux . Chateau La- 
fite, I believe, if there has been a 
good year. With the salad, which 
must naturally be based on that 
great American contribution, the 
calavo, one might argue the mer- 
its of a Chateau Cheval Blanc, 
a Clos Fortet or an Haut Brion, 
but I think — ” 

Magarac nodded. He jerked to 
wakefulness when Latourelle 
stopped and regarded him with a 
hurt expression. 

After a moment, the French- 
man looked contrite. “But of 
course! Forgive me! Here you 

64 



have been in battle, righteous 
battle but a lost cause, and I sit 
droning on about joys out of your 
reach. I promised you a surprise, 
d d I not? Well, a surprise you 
shall have, one to lighten your 
soul and renew your manhood. 
I have been saving it, denying it 
even to myself till you should 
come, for shared pleasures are 
best. But now — wait!” 

He sprang to his feet and went 
over to a cabinet and opened it. 
Bottles glistened within, row on 
row of them, slender bottles with 
labels of gentle witchcraft. 

Magarac felt his jaw clank 
down. He pulled it up again with 
an effort. 

T ATOURELLE laughed boy- 
ishly and rubbed his hands. 
“Is it not a noble sight? Is it not 
a vision for the gods? I assure 
you, this hope is all that has sus- 
tained me in my time on Mars.” 
“My God!” stammered Magarac. 
“It must have cost a fortune!” 

“It did, it did indeed. Luckily, 
I have a fortune — or had.” La- 
tourelle broke out two slim 
glasses and a corkscrew. “You see, 
it has hitherto been impossible to 
export liquors to other planets. 
Quite apart from the cost, the 
prolonged high acceleration and 
then the free fall, they ruin it. 
Even crossing an ocean, a good 
wine is sadly bruised. Crossing 
space, it simply dies; one might 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



as well drink Martian beer,” 
“Um . yes, I’ve heard of that. 
Colloidal particles agglom era te 
and obscure chemical reactions 
take place. Even whisky won’t 
survive the trip.” Magarac ap- 
proached the cabinet reverently. 
“But this—” 

“This is a new process. The last 
Fleet brought me a letter an- 
nouncing success and I hastened 
to order a case of assorted wines. 
It will not be much, but it will 
help keep me sane until the next 
shipment can arrive.” 

Latourelle extracted a bottle 
and held it up to the light. “The 
process, it involves a tasteless, 
harmless additive which stabilizes 
both the colloids and the chemis- 
try. The finest Chambertin-C^los 
has been flown through an At- 
lantic hurricane and served that 
same night in New York with no 
slightest injury done to it.” 

The cork popped out with a 
flourish. “Now, my old, we drink 
the first wine to cross interplane- 
tary space!” 

The living red stream sparkled 
into the glasses. Silently, as if 
performing a holy rite, the two 
men raised their drinks and 
sipped. 

Latourelle went white. “Nom 
de diable! Pure vinegar!” 

| ' HAT dauntless pioneer, the 
Immortal Oliver Latourelle! 
At a time of crisis, when the /gj> 



planet of Mars faced ruin and 
dictatorship, it was he and his 
great associate Laslos Magarac, 
later to become Premier of the 
Dominion and first President of a 
fully independent nation— it was 
those two men, driven by the 
need to expand humanity’s fron- 
tiers to the very stars, who cre- 
ated the space-warp ship. 

“ Think of it, gentlemen! In one 
month, Latourelle had worked 
out the principles of such a ves- 
sel. 

“In two more months, he had 
equipped an old ship, the piously 
renamed St. Emilion, with a warp 
engine and had crossed to Earth 
in a few microseconds. It was only 
a token cargo he brought back to 
Mars, a case of wine, doubtless to 
symbolize the achievements of 
his own fair country, but he had 
proved it could be done. That 
simple case of wine foreshadowed 
the argosies which now ply be- 
tween a thousand suns. 

“And it was the great Latour- 
elle’s first words when he emerged 
from his ship on his return from 
Earth and staggered across the 
sands of Mars — surely too over- 
come by emotion to walk straight 
— it was his words which have be- 
come the official motto of the 
Martian Republic and will live 
forever in Martian hearts as a 
flaming symbol of human genius: 

“A votre sante!"

The Category Inventors 

By ARTHUR SELLINGS 



There was security for all in this well-run 
world — but what happened to a man who tried 
to get ahead could never happen to a robot! 

Illustrated 



I T WAS the robot breaking 
down that brought matters 

to a head. Not that they 

hadn’t been gathering for months. 
Ever since, in fact, he had been 
put on reserve, Marge seemed to 
have been conducting a cam- 
paign — a subtle, insistent, com- 
pletely wifely campaign. 

First it was: “It’s not your 

fault, honey, the world just 
doesn’t understand creative art- 
ists any more.” 

He had said modestly, “Oh, a 
bassoon player isn’t creative, 

peaches; he’s executant.” 

“Anyway,” she retorted firmly, 
“he’s an artist.” It seemed only 
as an afterthought that she added, 
“That means he’s got intelligence 







66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and imagination. And that means 
he’s got a head start when it 
comes to finding a new job — 
doesn’t it, honey?” And her big 
brown eyes had looked up at him 
so confidently, so guilelessly. 

“Sure, sure, a head start,” he 
had said, feeling his heart droop. 
Being able to play the bassoon 
didn’t seem much of a qualifica- 
tion for doing any other job at 
all. 

“Of course,” she said a few 
days later, “you could get a job 
in a jazz band, Gilbert, couldn’t 
you? It’s all the rage again.” She

added hastily, “Oh, I know you 
don’t like the idea, but — ” 

He explained to her patiently 
that it wasn’t a matter of not 
liking the idea. It was simply that 
he couldn’t. Playing jazz wasn’t 
quite the same thing as playing 
serious music, which was why 
robots could be taught to do the 
one, but not — so far, anyway 

— the other. 

“Well, Phil Tomkys made the 
switch, didn’t he?” she said. 

What Phil Tomkys could do 
and what he could do, he’d told 
her tersely, were two entirely 
different things. Jazz playing was 
a certain specialized ability — 
he made it sound on a level with 
safe-breaking or parricide — and 
you either had it or you hadn’t 

— now did she see? 

^ W/ELL, couldn’t you com- 
»» pose then?” she suggest- 
ed some time later. She couldn’t 
have touched him on a rawer 
spot. But she went on, blithely 
unwitting: “How about those 

tunes you’re always humming to 
yourself? They sound pretty 
good to me and — 

“They’re probably someone 
else’s,” he told her curtly. They 
were someone else’s, he knew. 
Ten years of orchestra playing 
had left no room in his head for 
original music. He’d learned that 
at great cost, because he had 
tried his hand once at a quartet 

68 



for bassoon, celeste, recorder and 
guitar — and even that unusual 
combination hadn’t been proof 
against his subconscious; it was 
almost finished before he’d real- 
ized that it was all bits and pieces 
from obscure compositions he’d 
played in the past. 

The memory of that first and 
last attempt made him feel guilty 
now. That was one of the nastiest 
things about being on reserve — 
it made you think yourself defi- 
cient in not having abilities that 
there was no earthly reason you 
should have, anyway. 

But he managed to keep a hold 
on his temper. And the next time. 
And, by a mighty effort, the next. 
But the tension mounted and 
mounted — until the robot broke 
down one fine spring morning. 
And then it stopped mounting. 
It exploded. 

“Right in the middle of getting 
breakfast, too,” Marge wailed, 
surveying the inert mass of metal 
that lay by the kitchen table. 

Gilbert had just got up. He 
rubbed the sleep from his eyes. 
“I’ll ring Center,” he said with an 
unurgent yawn. 

“But the children will be late 
for school,” she said. “Colin! 
Michael!” she called to the bath- 
room. “Do hurry.” 

“It’s not much use their hurry- 
ing, is it, if there’s no breakfast 
ready for them?” Gilbert ob- 
served helpfully. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“What do you think I’m trying 
to do?” she snapped, juggling 
wildly with unfamiliar imple- 
ments. “I’ve only got two pairs 
of hands.” 

He roared at that and struck 
a pose. “Step closer, folks! See 
the only woman in captivity with 
four arms.” 

She stamped her foot in flus- 
tered rage. “You know what I 
meant. A fine father you are, 
standing there trying to be funny 
when your children are late for 
school. As if the poor mites 
haven’t had enough to put up 
with lately.” 

His laughter stopped abruptly. 
“And what exactly do you mean 
by that?” 

“What I say.” She jabbed des- 
perately at food tubes. 

He glared at her. “Well, just 
what have the ‘poor mites’ had 
to put up with?” 

“Oh, I’m too busy to argue 
with you. Anyway, you wouldn’t 
understand.” 

“Oh, wouldn’t I? Perhaps I 
understand only too well. ‘Lately’ 
wouldn’t be . just three months 
and thirteen days?” 

“If you like,” she muttered, 
not looking at him. 

“Just as I thought!” he exploded. 
“You blame me. Ever since they 
put me on reserve you’ve been 
getting at me. That’s a fine en- 
couragement for a man, I must 
say. If you think — ” 

THE CATEGORY INVENTORS 



I N HIS temper he had ad- 
vanced a step toward her. He 
failed to notice the recumbent 
robot until he fell headlong over 
it. He lay there, rubbing a scuffed 
shin and swearing colorfully. 

“If you’re going to use foul 
language,” his wife said icily, “you 
might at least keep your voice 
down. You know what sharp ears 
the children have.” 

He climbed to his feet, glaring. 
“Oh, so now I’m a corrupter of 
my own children, is that it? Well, 
let me tell you that — ” 

But at that moment a terrific 
squawking rose from the Heno- 
mat, the gadget that synthesised 
fresh eggs from raw meal. His 
wife jerked and jabbed frantic- 
ally at the kitchen control panel. 
She only succeeded in releasing 
several faucets of assorted juices 
and ketchups. As they splashed 
and oozed over the floor she 
made one last despairing assault 
on the control panel. The faucets 
continued to run. But a blaring 
of jazz music joined the chaos 
now. 

She threw up her hands in 
surrender, sank into a chair and 
buried her head on the table-top. 

Gilbert, standing there in a 
deafened daze, felt a sudden pang 
of remorse. Perhaps it was his 
fault; perhaps he should have 
foreseen the day, when a metal 
being with a crystalline brain 
would take over his job, as robots 



69 



had taken over so many other 
people’s by now. Contritely he 
dashed to the control panel and 
fumbled at it. 

Somehow his manipulations 
did the trick. The faucets gurgled 
to a stop, the music snapped off 
and the Henomat died in a flurry 
of feathery whimpers. 

Gilbert’s self-esteem recovered 
slightly. He looked expectantly 
at his wife, but she did not lift 
her head. She only sniffed a dis- 
mal and muffled sniff. 

There’s gratitude! he thought 
angrily. Well, it wasn’t his fault. 
His gaze fell upon the abject 
heap of metal on the floor. It was 
its fault — it and millions of its 
kind. Suddenly all the frustration 
of the last few months focused 
on the robot and ignited in anger. 
He lashed out at it with his foot. 
The foot was still slipper-shod 
and it hurt. But he was too en- 
raged to care and the action, al- 
though it made no impression on 
the robot, brought gratifying re- 
lief to his feelings. 

H E TURNED to find that 
Marge had raised her head 
and was regarding him wither- 
ingly. 

“Well, now I’ve seen every- 
thing,” she said. “A grown man 
actually kicking a poor defense- 
less robot.” 

“When it’s down, too,” he said 
caustically. He flared up again. 

70 



“It seems you’ve got more sym- 
pathy for a robot than you have 
for your husband. It’s a fine way 
to — ” 

He was interrupted by a small 
human avalanche tumbling into 
the room. 

“Morning, Mom,” said the boys 
in chorus. “Morning, Pop.” 

Was there, thought Gilbert, a 
pause, just a slight one, between 
the two greetings? And a dying 
fall to the second? 

“Hey, the robot’s passed out,” 
said Colin. 

“Was that what all the noise 
was, Pop?” Michael asked. 

Gilbert glowered. Then he 
sighed and dragged the robot out 
of the kitchen by its feet. He 
dumped it in a bedroom closet 
and dialed Robocenter. 

He lingered a while before he 
went back to the kitchen. He 
saw that the kids had left — 
without much breakfast, obvious- 
ly — and he realized then that 
that was why he had lingered — 
to avoid facing them. So it was 
getting to that point now.

G ILBERT was shaved and 
dressed and feeling desper- 
ate when the door buzzer sound- 
ed. Not from any desire to be 
helpful — that he certainly didn’t 
feel — but just to be able to 
hear the sound of his own voice 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



again, anybody’s voice, he said, 
“That’ll be the mechanic from 
Center. I’ll open it.” 

But it wasn’t the mechanic. 

“Hello, son,” came a plummy 
voice. Another one, gentle and 
fluting, cooed from behind a 
mountainous fluorotex package, 
"Surprise!” 

It was George and Phoebe, 
Marge’s parents. Gilbert winced. 
This was all he needed. 

“Had a sudden call from party 
H.Q.,” boomed George. 

“And we took the early rocket 
in so we could have an hour with 
you,” Phoebe explained, peeking 
birdlike from behind her burden. 

“Ah — er, come in, then,” said 
Gilbert. 

“Anything wrong, son?” said 
George, drawing Gilbert to one 
side as Phoebe went to find 
Marge, 

“Wrong? Why, no, nothing’s 
wrong.” He laughed unconvinc- 
ingly. “It’s just that I was expect- 
ing someone else. The mechanic 
from Robocenter.” 

“That robot of yours broken 
down? Too bad. The poor kid’s 
up to her neck in it, eh? I’ll just 
say hello to her.” 

He came back quickly. “I’ll say 
she is! Still, Mother’s pitching in.” 
He winked as sounds of furious 
activity came from the kitchen. 
“She’s just the same at home. 
Leaves so little for our robot to 
do, he’s thinking of applying for

a pension.” He chuckled hugely. 
Then, noticing that filbert wasn’t 
as much as smiling, he stopped 
abruptly and turned on a manner 
that Gilbert knew well by now 
— the earnest, the man-to-man. 
“Well, how are things, my boy?” 

“You mean, have I got a job 
yet?” 

“Heavens, no! I know it’s not 
that easy. We all know it takes 
time. What I meant was, how are 
the ideas working out?” 

“ What ideas?” 

George shook his head. “As bad 
as that, eh? Still, it’s the darkest 
hour before the dawn. You mark 
my words, I’ve seen it happen 
so many times. Just when a man 
thinks there isn’t a single idea 
left that someone else hasn’t 
thought of, a real big one comes 
down out of the blue and hits 
him right between the — ” 

The door buzzer cut across 
George’s eloquence. Gilbert 
ducked out in relief. 

1 1 1 HIS TIME it was the me- 
chanic, clad in the gray cov- 
eralls of Roboservice. But he 
wasn’t alone. 

“Yes?” said Gilbert to the other 
three who were about to follow 
the mechanic in. The three were 
also in gray, but wore bolero and 
slacks, street style. They were 
young, cropped of head, their 
faces scrubbed and intense. 

“We’re therapists,” explained 

71 



the foremost and tallest one. 

“Therapists?” Gilbert echoed. 
“But nobody here’s sick.” 

“Hah! That’s a good one,” said 
the foremost of the three, turn- 
ing his head to share his amuse- 
ment with his colleagues. He 
turned back to Gilbert. “We are, 
of course, robotherapists.” 

“Huh?” was all that Gilbert 
could manage. 

“I am a robopsychiatrist,” the 
other amplified. 

“I am a robosynaptic stimula- 
tor,” said the second. 

“And said the third with 
quiet pride, “am a robomorale 
coordinator.” 

Just like the three bears, Gil- 
bert thought. Of all the twaddle! 
But he stood aside for them to 
enter. 

“Where is the robot?” said the 
first therapist. 

Gilbert, deciding he disliked 
the man’s manner, addressed 
himself pointedly to the me- 
chanic. “In the bedroom closet, 
second on the left. I dumped it 
there after it broke down. It clut- 
tered up the kitchen too much.” 

“Right,” said the mechanic ami- 
ably and went through. 

“Too bad,” said the leading 
therapist, shaking his head. “It 
would have been better if you 
had left it where it fell. The 
failure attitude often gives a valu- 
able pointer to the cause of break- 
down.” He beckoned to his col- 



leagues and they followed in the 
wake of the mechanic. 

Gilbert looked after them for 
a long moment before returning 
to the living room. 

‘Well, now I’ve seen every- 
thing,” he told his father-in-law. 
“They’ve actually got psychia- 
trists for robots.” 

But George was quite unsur- 
prised. “Why, didn’t you know? 
They’ve had them for six months 
or more. One of the brightest new 
fields in years. The teloids were 
full of it.” 

“Oh, I must have missed it,” 
Gilbert murmured, realization 
dawning of just how out of touch 
he’d been with the world at large; 
how absorbed in his world of 
music playing that seemed now 
as unreal and faraway as an age 
in history. 

44 YOU SEE, son,” George said 
earnestly. “That’s the way 
things are now. Branching out, 
keeping one step ahead of the 
robot all the time. That’s what, 
if you don’t mind my saying so, 
you haven’t realized yet. A man’s 
got to be adaptable. Now, take 
old Tom Angel, he was a school- 
mate of mine. He was a top-class 
tailor and thought his job was 
safe as houses. But it wasn’t. 

“So, after he’d been on reserve 
a time he happens to remember 
the birthday cards people used 
to send each other when we were 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



kids. So what does Tom do? He 
ups and registers himself as the 
first of a new generation of greet- 
ing-card verse writers. And this 
is the best part, he’d never writ- 
ten a line of verse in his life. But 
he was first in, so he got charter 
rights. Get the idea? Once you 
get in the progressive mood, 
you’re all set.” 

Gilbert reflected dully that 
brushing the dust off a defunct 
custom was a funny kind of pro- 
gress, but he tried to look in- 
terested, knowing that George 
was trying to be helpful in his 
fashion, just as Marge’s mother 
was when she brought parcels of 
things a reservist’s valid-for-a- 
week scrip wouldn’t stretch for. 

“You see, Gil,” George went 
on, “this isn’t something new. 
Something like it has been hap- 
pening for hundreds of years now, 
with machines displacing people. 
It’s the scale of this that’s new, 
because the robots threaten 
everybody’s job.” 

“Except politicians’ and robo- 
psychiatrists’,” Gilbert couldn’t 
resist saying. 

George looked pained. “Don’t 
say that, Gil. And don’t think 
politics aren’t getting as competi- 
tive as everything else. Imagine, 
they even sent me to school — 
me at my time of life — to get 
what they called historical per- 
spective. I kicked like mad, but 
I must admit it did me a power

of good. It makes a man see why 
there’ve been so many changes 
since robots were invented. You 
know — ” he wagged a finger at 
Gilbert — “there’s been more 
progress in the past twenty years 
than in the whole hundred before 
that. From space travel to — 
well, to self-coiling spaghetti.” 

“I can’t see much progress in 
throwing five million people on 
reserve in the process.” 

“Ah, but ten years ago there 
were fifteen million. That shows 
the challenge of the robot has 
been taken up. Because it’s not 
only a challenge, it’s an oppor- 
tunity. This is the Age of Oppor- 
tunity. We can all be thankful 
for one thing, at least, that we’re 
not living in the last century.” 
George shuddered. “Then, if a 
man was out of a job he had to 
find one!” 

“He had to? I wish I had the 
chance.” 

“Ah, but that’s the point. It 
wasn’t always so easy. Nowadays, 
a man doesn’t have to fight for a 
job. All he has to do is invent 
one.” 

REMEMBER reading that 
bit in the book,” said Gilbert. 
“You know? The one with pic- 
tures that they give you in ex- 
change for your job?” 

_ “Oh, sorry,” George said a bit 
huffily. “I was only trying to 
help.” He rallied. “Anyway, you 

73 



have got a father-in-law in the 
right party, that’s one consola- 
tion. The party that stands up 
for the reservist’s rights.” 

Gilbert lifted an inward eye 
to heaven. 

“Yes, sir,” George continued. 
“If the Technoes had their way, 
a reservist’s life wouldn’t be 
worth a light. But we fought for 
his rights all along the line. It 
was us Populists, for instance, 
who saw that every family — 
workers and reservists alike — 
had a robot of its own by inalien- 
able rights.” 

Gilbert had had as much as he 
could stand. “To hell with your 
inalienable rights!” he exploded. 
“Both parties have got it nicely 
carved up between them. All 
either of you care about is mak- 
ing sure that things go on just 
the way they are. As for the pre- 
cious benefits of having a robot, 
let me tell you I’d be perfectly 
happy if there weren’t any robots 
at all — especially the ones that 
sit on their chromium-plated 
backsides in chromium-plated or- 
chestras!” 

George looked shocked now. 
“I — I — you don’t know what 
you’re saying,” he burbled. “Why, 
you’re talking like a — like a 
Luddite.” 

“Oh, I am, am I? Well, let me 
— ” Gilbert stopped in mid-air 
and said suspiciously, “What’s a 
Luddite?” 



“Luddites were the people who 
broke up the first power machines 
two hundred years ago.” It was 
an item he’d picked up in the 
course on Historical Perspective. 
“And if that’s the way you’re — ” 

“Hold it!” A wild light came 
into Gilbert’s eye. He had just 
thought of something. Why, of 
course! Why not? 

“What is it, son?” said George, 
anxious now at the look on his 
son-in-law’s face. 

But Gilbert didn’t hear him. 
With a whoop he bounded for the 
door, threw it back and collided 
with the leading therapist who 
was waiting on the other side, 
knuckles raised. 

“Well — ” gasped the therapist, 
staggering. 

“Sorry,” said Gilbert cheerfully, 
trying to push past. 

“But there’s something I have 
to tell you,” said the therapist, 
recovering balance and breath 
with an effort. Behind him his 
two colleagues closed ranks. 

Gilbert halted. “Well, what is 
it? Make it brief. I’m a busy 
man.” He laughed delightedly at 
the novelty of the words. 

HP HE THERAPIST gave him 
a queer look. “It’s no laugh- 
ing matter, I’m afraid. We just 
gave your robot a tape-auto in 
there and the results were sad, 
sad. We shall have to take it back 
for immediate reorientation. You

see — ” he shook his head gravely 
— “it had developed a severe 
guilt complex.” 

“Guilt complex?” Gilbert 
echoed blankly. 

“That’s right. They’re sensitive, 
you know. And if they once get 
the idea that their owners aren’t 
happy, that starts it. They think 
it’s their fault, they wonder what 
mistakes they could have made. 
They brood on it and then they 
do make mistakes. Oh, little ones, 
the kind you or I wouldn’t notice 
at all, but a robot does because 
it knows it’s not supposed to 
make mistakes. That only makes 
it feel more guilty and so it goes 
until — well, it just gives up in 
despair.” 

Despite his urgency to be off, 
Gilbert found himself listening 
with fascinated incredulity. 

The therapist was achingly 
earnest. “Of course, we’ll know 
better next time, won’t we? Cen- 
ter will send a replacement up. 
Just let the new one know it’s 
making you happy, that’s all, and 
everything will be fine. Just a 
smile, a grateful word now and 
then, eh?” 

For a moment Gilbert looked 
at the therapist with the expres- 
sion of a child seeing its first ele- 
phant. Then he burst out laugh- 
ing. “Of course I’ll let it know 
I’m happy! I am happy. Who 
wouldn’t be happy, living in this 
Age of Opportunity?” He noticed 



George’s startled face peering 
from the living room and he 
laughed loudly again. “Now, if 
you don’t mind — ” 

The therapists looked blankly 
at each other and fell away as 
Gilbert made for the door. 

Ill 

HP HE CATEGORY Office was 
•* carrying its usual scattered 
population of reservists, waiting 
in the slender hope of getting in 
on a hot tip. Gilbert walked past 
them, straight to the first cubicle. 
Inside was a counter, behind it - j * 
a robot attendant. 

“I want to file a category,” Gil- 
bert announced. 

“Certainly, sir,” said the robot, 
producing a form and an envelope 
from beneath the counter. 

The form required particulars 
of name, date of birth, reserve 
number. Gilbert entered these in 
impatiently, then arrived at the 
section headed: Nature of Cate- 
gory. Boldly he filled in neo-lud- 
dite. He scratched his chin 
thoughtfully with the end of his 
stylus and added, A lawful oppo- 
sition to the robot economy. 

He smiled to himself. There 
was a job no robot would ever 
be able to take over. Under the 
heading Overall Classification of 
Category he entered political. 

He placed the form flat in the 
envelope as instructed and passed 



THE CATEGORY INVENTORS

it with a flourish to the robot. 

The robot franked it across the 
flap and fed it into a machine by 
its side. In a few seconds, the 
envelope popped out again and 
the robot handed it back to Gil- 
bert. 

Gilbert felt a sudden disquiet. 
“Well?” he asked. 

“Your application will take a 
short time to check,” the robot 
explained. “This machine sends 
a copy to the registry below. 
They carry a complete file there 
of all categories.” 

“Oh, I see,” said Gilbert, re- 
lieved. While he waited he scan- 
ned the posters stuck up around 
the walls of the cubicle. Most 
bore the faces of successful cate- 
gory filers: inventors of such jobs 
as hydroponics stabilizer, cyber- 
netic diviner, traumographist. 
What in creation was a traumo- 
graphist? Gilbert wondered. A 
shock writer? One who drew 
graphs of shock responses? In 
what? Men? Atoms? 

Gilbert smiled. The sound of 
such specialized and enigmatic 
vocations no longer made him 
feel hopelessly ill-equipped in 
this complex world. Now he was 
going to meet the world on its 
own terms and — — 

A BEEP came from the ma- 
chine and a 'slip of paste- 
board popped up. The robot took 
it, scanned it, then lifted its cry- 



stalline eyes to Gilbert. 

“I’m sorry, sir, but your appli- 
cation has been rejected.” 

Gilbert stood dazed, unbeliev- 
ing. 

The robot went on, “The Cate- 
gory Office extends its sincere 
regrets and trusts that this will 
not deter you from making fur- 
ther applications. The Category 
Office — ” 

Gilbert interrupted what was 
obviously a set speech. He 
stretched across the counter and 
grabbed the robot by one articu- 
lated arm. “Look here, you — 
you metallic mouthpiece. That 
application is legitimate. No- 
body’s got any right to reject it. 
You can’t just stand there and — ” 

“Please.” The unalterable pitch 
of the robot’s voice only pointed 
its obvious embarrassment. Con- 
ditioned, like all robots, never to 
be hostile to humans, it could 
only make pathetic token efforts 
to release itself. 

Gilbert sighed and let go, feel- 
ing ashamed of himself. “Any- 
way,” he persisted, “I want to see 
somebody about this.” 

“An overseer is already on his 
way,” the robot said. 

He must, unnoticed, have 
pressed an alarm signal, Gilbert 
realized. 

The overseer came in briskly; 
a round, cheerful individual. 

“Ah, Mr. Gilbert Parry. About 
your application, is it? Well, I’m 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



very sorry. We dislike having to 
turn down anybody’s application, 
you understand. Naturally, we — ” 
“Naturally nothing,” Gilbert 
said brusquely. “That category I 
put forward is perfectly admissi- 
ble.” 

“But, Mr. Parry — ” 

“Don’t interrupt. I’ve got a 
right to be heard. You may think 
you have all this sewn up nice 
and tidily. That’s what the two 
political parties think, but they’re 
wrong. Both of them support the 
system as it is. That’s not 
enough.” 

“But, Mr. Parry, you can’t — ” 
“I can. What’s more, I’ll set out 



and prove, if I have to, that even 
from the standpoint of the status 
quo an opposition is socially 
necessary. Now, don’t try to tell 
me I can’t do that.” 

The manager smiled. “But the 
need of an opposition is recog- 
nized. I was only trying to tell 
you that you can’t register the 
category because it was registered 
years ago.” 

“What!” 

“Yes, the Humans Only move- 
ment, as it’s called, is a recog- 
nized party, though it’s never 
managed to win an election or 
attract many adherents. Most 
people are only too grateful for

77 



the benefits robots have brought. 
But the movement does have 
State backing: funds, offices, the 
same proportion of salaried offi- 
cials to members as the two big 
parties.” 

Gilbert was already drifting 
miserably to the door. 

“Of course,” the overseer added 
helpfully, “you could take up vol- 
untary work for the party. There’s 
always the chance you might be 
able to step into a salaried va- 
cancy in a few years.” 

“Thanks, it doesn’t matter,” 
Gilbert mumbled, and left the 
cubicle. A group of waiting hope- 
fuls took one look at his face and 
melted away. 

O UTSIDE, he wandered along. 

There was only one thing 
to do. Start all over again at some 
other line, study and study until 
he was as proficient at it as he 
was at playing the bassoon. 

But what line? And how could 
he be sure that that wouldn’t be 
taken over by robots before he 
became skilled at it? Still, there 
was nothing for it but to try. Even 
if it came to nothing, Marge 
wouldn’t be able to get at him 
— not fairly, anyway. More than 
that, he wouldn’t have to put up 
with his own gnawing sense of 
failure. 

Noticing a library, he turned 
into it. He asked the assistant — 
a robot even here in a center of 

78 r 



learning — for guidance. It 
brought him a well-thumbed 
handbook. 

Leading in the categories it 
listed were those of the old occu- 
pations that were ■ too closely 
linked to flesh and blood and 
spirit to be easily yielded up to 
the robot — medicine, law, the 
creative arts. Well, medicine was 
out. He was no weakling, but he 
couldn’t stand the thought of 
coldly opening up bodies. Law? 
He couldn’t even argue success- 
fully with his own wife, let alone 
with a judge and jury. And as 
for the creative arts — you had 
to have a vocation, hadn’t you? 

No, it would have to be some- 
thing totally new — one of the 
bewilderingly complex fields like 
. what was it on that poster? 
. traumography? On the im- 
pulse, he looked it up. 

Yes, it was here, all right. But 
he couldn’t, after minutes of per- 
plexed reading and re-reading, 
even make out what field it was 
in, the language describing it was 
so specialized. Hell! it was even 
worse than he had feared. 

He riffled through the book de- 
jectedly. Then suddenly a dis- 
played ad caught his eye. 

ON RESERVE? DON’T FRET! 
CONTACT THE C. P. JONES BUREAU 
CATEGORY INVENTORS 
ROOM 53 , UNIVERSE BUILDING 
So there were ways! Why, of 
course, there had to be. The sys- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tem had been going for years; it 
was bound to happen that people 
would emerge with just this flair. 
Alert young men, their minds 
not canalized in the narrow 
bounds of one profession, but at 
ease in this complicated world, 
able to see the need for a new 
job here, a new branch there. 

But how would you pay for 
such a service? Reservists’ scrip 
was unnegotiable. Still, he had a 
few hundred credits of real money 
salted away for a possible emer- 
gency. It was worth a try. 

U NIVERSE Building, despite 
its grandiloquent name, was 
a small, dingy building down- 
town, all of thirty years old by 
the look of it. Still, Gilbert told 
himself, it’s unwise to pre-judge 
the goods by the package. 

But the sudden fracas was 
more disturbing. He had to jump 
back hastily as the narrow swing- 
doors flew open and two burly 
individuals burst through, carry- 
ing a struggling, spitting burden. 
Through flailing arms and legs, 
Gilbert glimpsed an old gnome- 
like face, pink with frustration. 

Once on the sidewalk the two 
huskies lowered the man to his 
feet with exaggerated solicitude, 
gave him one meaningful look 
and , retreated into the building. 
One of them turned to throw out 
a battered brief case at the old 
man’s feet. 

THE CATEGORY INVENTORS 



“I’ll get a writ served on you, 
you scum!’’ their victim bellowed, 
shaking his fist. His stature was 
as gnomelike as his face, but his 
voice was surprisingly resonant. 
“A man’s got his rights, you know. 
I’ll.— I’ll — ” 

The little man subsided, as if 
realizing the futility of hurling 
his protests at blank doors. With 
a spluttering sigh he picked up 
his case, gave an outraged jerk 
to his bolero, then hobbled off 
down the street. 

Gilbert looked after him for a 
moment, feeling a twinge of sym- 
pathy for the poor old chap. He 
only hoped the incident had noth- 
ing to do with the C. P. Jones 
Bureau, that that wasn’t their 
normal way of handling clients. 
Quelling the thought, he went in. 

“Room fifty-three?” Gilbert 
asked the robot enquiry clerk. 
“The C. P. Jones Bureau.” 

“I’m sorry, sir, but Mr. Jones 
no longer operates here.” 

“Oh, but his bureau?” 

“Mr. Jones himself was the 
bureau.” 

“Well, has he started up any- 
where else, do you know?” 

“He left no information on that 
point, sir.” 

G ILBERT shrugged resignedly 
and left. So that was that. 
And that left what? Traumogra- 
phy? He shuddered at the 
thought. As he hesitated on the 

79 



sidewalk, he thought of the 
chucking-out incident. ' Now, 
there was a job. They daren’t 
build a man-handling robot. He 
flexed his biceps thoughtfully — 

The thought died miserably. 
"You probably had to have your 
name put down at birth for a 
trade as rudimentary as that. He 
sighed and wandered off. 

Passing a bar, he went in as 
automatically as if it were a 
habit, which it never had been. 
This was an open bar, not one 
of those bleak reservists’ places 
where you had to produce a ra- 
tion card. Here you paid money. 
He went to a booth and ordered 
a double Scotch from the robot 
waiter. 

It wasn’t until he turned to 
reach in his pocket to pay that 
Gilbert noticed who was sitting 
opposite him. It was the little old 
man he had seen thrown out of 
the Universe Building. He was 
looking mournfully at his drink 
as if it were a clouded crystal 
ball. 

The sight moved Gilbert to 
pity. Here was he feeling sorry 
for himself. At least he had youth. 
On an impulse he lifted his glass 
and said, “Better times.” 

The old man raised his head 
slowly. “Huh!” he said. Then he 
managed a wan smile and said, 
“Thank you,” and drained his 
glass. Gilbert drained his own 
and, to his questioning glance, 

80 



the old man said, “Same as you.” 
Gilbert ordered up. 

“I saw what happened to you 
back there,” Gilbert ventured 
sympathetically. 

“Did you?” The old man 
sighed. “The robbers! Throwing 
a man out after all these years.” 
He looked so miserable that Gil- 
bert instantly regretted having 
mentioned the incident. 

“It’s a wrench when you’ve 
worked in the same building for 
nearly ten years,” the old man 
went on. 

“Oh, you worked there?” 

“I had my own office. The 
C. P. Jones Bureau.” 

“You — C. P. Jones?” Gilbert’s 
conception of alert young men 
underwent violent revision. 

“Why, you heard of me?” The 
old boy’s face lit up eagerly. 

“Heard of you? I was coming 
to see if you could fix me up.” 
“You were? Ah, well, perhaps it 
was best I wasn’t there. It saved 
you from being disappointed.” 
Gilbert was puzzled. “I was 
disappointed. But how do you 
mean?” 

« W EUU I didn’t have a cate- 
gory in stock.” He paused, 
then with the air of one relieved 
to get a confession off his chest, 
added, “As a matter of fact, son, 
I never did manage to invent a 
single category — except the 
one.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Oh,” said Gilbert, his sym- 
pathy beginning to be tinged with 
suspicion. “What was the one?” 
“Why, the category of category 
inventor, of course.” The old man 
sniffed. “Perhaps I wasn’t very 
good at it, but I did have charter 
rights. Seems that nothing’s sa- 
cred any longer, not even charter 
rights. They revised my category 
a week ago and canceled my li- 
cense. Mind you, I didn’t take it 
sitting down. But what can you 
do?” He took a despondent sip 
at his drink. “They’ve got you all 
ways.” 

Gilbert felt a stirring of resent- 
ment at such ingratitude. “It 
seems to me,” he said roughly, 
“you had a pretty good run for 
your money. I should think your 
clients have got the grievance.” 
The old man looked up indig- 
nantly. “Why? They didn’t do 
too badly. I always worked hard 
for them. Was it my fault the 
ideas didn’t come? And it didn’t 
cost them anything. My fee was 
only payable out of salary if and 
when I delivered.” 

“Oh,” said Gilbert. The old 
man hadn’t been such a shark, 
then. 

The old man chuckled now. 
“You’re right, though, about hav- 
ing a good run. I suppose, all in 
all, I did.” 

“But how come you got away 
with it all that time?” 

Mr. Jones chuckled again. 

THE CATEGORY INVENTORS 



“Well, it was the Rehabilitation 
Office that paid me my fixed 
salary. Whereas it was the Labor 
Office that I was supposed to pay 
any fees into, less my commission, 
of course. Once a year the Ac- 
counting Office — that’s another 
department again — sent around 
a robot auditor to check the 
book. They just never got around 
to checking up with each other, 
I suppose — until now.” He fell 
back into gloom. “Now I’ve got 
to invent another job.” 

Gilbert examined the other’s 
gnomelike face, the gnarled hands 
about his glass. “But I should 
have thought you’d be past . 
I mean, well — ” 

“You mean, why do I worry 
about another job at my age, is 
that it? Because my wife is not 
my age. She’s only — well, she 
says she’s twenty-nine — any- 
way, she wouldn’t take kindly to 
the notion of my being on 
reserve.” 

“Ah, these wives,” Gilbert 
agreed. “It wouldn’t be so bad if 
we didn’t have them to reckon 
with.” 

“Wouldn’t it?” said Mr. Jones, 
almost fiercely. “For me, I’m glad 
the way it is. If it wasn’t for Babs 
— that’s my wife — I’d have 
gone to pieces. I used to be a 
trapeze artist in the circus. That’s 
how I met Babs; she was a dancer 
in a sideshow. I was the oldest 
trapeze man in the game, but 

81 




82

even I had to pack it in some 
day. Got too shaky. If it hadn’t 
been for Babs, I’d have gone to 
seed, been in my urn by now as 
like as not. Babs has got her 
faults, but she’s a damn sight 
better encouragement to a man 
than any of these noble, shoulder- 
to-shoulder dames. They want the 
feeling of power over a man. Babs 
only wants money and the things 
that money buys and then she’s 
happy. And so am I.” 

O ' 1 ILBERT felt suddenly small 
* beside such rough-and-ready 
philosophy. “Mm-mm, maybe 
you’re right. Have another drink.” 
“No, it’s my turn,” the old man 
insisted. And, as the drinks ar- 
rived, “But I’m talking about my- 
self too much. How is it with 
you?” 

Gilbert told him and they had 
another drink. And they swapped 
yarns about their ex-professions. 
And they had another drink. And 
then Mr. Jones suggested they 
make a move to a real bar. 

And that started a pub-crawl 
such as Gilbert in his former 
sober life had never imagined 
possible. They talked, they joked. 
Even the way the world was 
treating them both assumed, un- 
der the influence of more and 
more drink, the aspect of one 
great joke. 

They laughed themselves silly 
over traumography and what it 

THE CATEGORY INVENTORS 



could be, their interpretations 
ranging from the inane to the 
obscene. That started them off 
on inventing mock categories, a 
game that lasted them through 
two bars and got them thrown 
out of a third when the categories 
became too outrageous. 

In one bar, in a lull, they 
ordered beer, and it had a melan- 
choly effect on the little man. He 
said they were selfish, that every- 
one was selfish. They ought to 
feel sorry, not for themselves, but 
for the robots. Revealing unex- 
pected depths to his character, 
he proceeded to recite lugubri- 
ously: 

How am I to face the odds 
Of Man’s bedevilment and God’s, 
I, a stranger and afraid 
In a world I never made? 

Luckily that phase didn’t last. 
Gilbert quickly ordered whiskey 
again and the resilient little man 
was back in form in a flash. 

And when Gilbert said, “What 
say we start a union for robots, 
then?” Mr. Jones threw himself 
into the idea with rare zest. They 
wondered if that might not be 
the salvation for both of them, 
until they reflected that a robot’s 
minimum week could only be a 
168 hours — work being their 
one function — and who’d have 
any interest in opposing that? 

The evening became more and 
more wild. Gilbert was never sure 
afterward whether the little man 

83 



really did give a demonstration 
of the finer points of trapeze 
work from a chandelier. He would 
recall that they drank a great 
deal of liquor between them and 
that somewhere in the early hours 
he fell into a robocab. 

After that all was darkness . 

IV 

IT WAS THE red glare of the 

Sun through his eyelids that 
woke him. He recoiled with a 
groan. He heard shutters pulled, 
and was devoutly grateful for the 
dimness. A figure moved near 
him. “Is that you, Marge honey?” 
he whimpered. 

“No, sir, this is your new 
robot.” 

It was holding out a glass of 
something that fizzed. Gilbert 
took it eagerly and downed it at 
a gulp. 

“A-ah, that’s better.” 

“Will there be anything else, 
sir?” 

“No, thanks.” He was seized 
with a sudden fear. “Yes. Yes, 
there is. My wife.” 

“Mrs. Parry asked me to tell 
her as soon as you awoke,” the 
robot said. 

Gilbert breathed out in relief. 
For a moment he had had the 
thought that Marge might have 
left him. He couldn’t have blamed 
her if she had — not after his 
behavior yesterday — then last 

84 



night on top of it. He was over- 
come with sudden contrition. 

“It’s all right,” he said to the 
robot. “I’ll tell her myself. I’m 
getting up.” 

And somehow he managed it, 
though he wouldn’t have without 
the assistance of the robot. 

“Thank you,” Gilbert told it. 
Then, feeling the need to do pen- 
ance all around, he added some- 
what sheepishly, “You have made 
me very happy.” 

“Thank you, sir,” said the robot, 
inevitably without inflection, but 
when it repeated the words Gil- 
bert felt that it really meant 
them. His penitential mood con- 
siderably sustained, he went in 
to Marge. And when he saw her, 
looking her prettiest, he felt 
touched to the quick. He began 
to mumble words of abject 
apology. 

But she cut him short with a 
kiss. “Don’t apologize, honey. It 
was my fault. If I hadn’t nagged 
you, you wouldn’t have acted like 
that.” She guided him to a chair. 
“Here.” She poured him a cup 
of black coffee. “What would you 
like for breakfast?” 

“I’ve got it here, thanks,” he 
said weakly. 

She nodded sympathetically. 

t^EELING abashed by so much 
understanding, Gilbert fum- 
bled in his pocket for a cigarette. 
With the pack, a slip of paper 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



came out. He looked at it. It read 
simply: Umbrological Parallax 

Tracer. Now what the heck did 
that mean? It was in his own 
handwriting, too. Then a dim 
memory crawled back from the 
confusion of the night before. He 
stared at the words, repeating 
them over and over to himself 
between sips of coffee. 

Then it suddenly dawned on 
him. “Why, that’s it!” he ex- 
claimed — and winced. Despite 
having served him up with an 
answer, his head still couldn’t 
stand that amount of sudden ex- 
citement. 

“What’s the matter, sweet?” 
Marge crooned. “Here, have a 
cerebrin.” 

He tottered to his feet. “Oh, 
don’t be so noble and shoulder- 
to-shoulder.” He grinned quickly 
and kissed her. “Don’t pay any 
attention to me, honey, I’ve just 
seen the light.” He drained his 
coffee hurriedly. “I’ve got some- 
thing urgent to attend to.” He 
kissed her again and dashed off. 

He chose a different cubicle 
this time, just to be on the safe 
side, and made his application 
with a practiced, if shaky, hand. 

This time an official came un- 
summoned. The manager him- 
self, what was more, for that’s 
how he introduced himself to Gil- 
bert. He was holding the copy 
of the application in his hand. 

“I’m glad to meet you, Mr. 

THE CATEGORY INVENTORS 



Parry,” he said. “Umbrological 
Parallax Tracer. Ah, yes, most 
interesting. What exactly is that?” 

With a calmness that surprised 
even himself, Gilbert answered, 
“Well, it involves ascertaining the 
degrees of parallax that occur in 
umbrological investigations. It’s 
not easy to explain in a few 
words, but — ” 

“Of course,” said the manager 
understanding^. “I thought it 
would probably be too complex 
for me to grasp. But you failed 
to enter the overall classification. 
I can make it on the photostat 
for you.” He looked at Gilbert 
inquiringly, his stylus poised. 

For a moment Gilbert flound- 
ered, cursing himself for having 
overlook the point. “Er — well, 
that’s not easy to describe, either. 
You see — ” 

“I understand,” said the man- 
ager soothingly. “Shall we say 
Synthesis, then? That covers a 
multitude of categories these 
days.” 

“Oh — ah, yes, yes, it’s defin- 
itely a form of synthesis.” 

ry'HE MANAGER nodded and 
filled in the space. “There’s 
just one more point. The West 
Town office has already admitted 
an application this morning for, 
ah — ” he consulted a slip of 
paper in his hand — “an Umbro- 
logical Parallax Co-relator. It just 
came through on the tape. Now, 

85 



you’d have to prove, if called 
upon, that the two functions are 
distinct and separate.” 

Gilbert doubted the testimony 
of his own ears. Then there really 
was something called Umbrology 
— in which parallaxes occurred? 
And then — 

“That wouldn’t have been a 
Mr. C. P. Jones, would it?” 

“Why, yes. You know each 
other, then?” 

“We should have met this 
morning,” lied Gilbert stoutly, “to 
file our categories together. One 
of us must have got the offices 
mixed. You see, umbrology has 
been our life work, in our spare 
hours, that is. But a parallax 
tracer is entirely different from a 
parallax co-relator. In fact, 
they’re two entirely opposed 
functions. Opposed, but mutually 
dependent, if you understand. 
You see, a parallax can only be 
co-related in dialectical opposi- 
tion and conjunction to and with 
its being traced.” Gilbert was be- 
ginning to enjoy himself. “To put 
it more simply — ” 

“That’s perfectly all right,” 
said the manager. “I’ll see that 
the distinction is made clear. 
Your charter will be mailed to 
you in a few days. But if you’re 
working in the same field, hadn’t 
you better share facilities with 
your friend, Mr. Jones? Provi- 
sionally, anyway?” 

“Why, yes,” said Gilbert. “It 



would save a lot of delay in our 
work.” 

“Indeed. Well, Mr. Jones will 
already have been granted offices. 
Hold on, I’ll get the address from 
West Town.” 

I T WAS A new office in a new 
building. When Gilbert en- 
tered, Mr. Jones was arranging 
some handsome-looking furniture. 
The little man straightened and 
his eyes lit up. 

“Hello, my boy. So you found 
me, then.” 

Gilbert grinned. “You old 
rogue. You nearly queered the 
pitch for me.” 

The old man chuckled. “Well, 
all’s fair. And somehow you didn’t 
get around to giving me your ad- 
dress last night. And I didn’t 
know you’d get the self-same idea. 
I do remember that we laughed 
a lot over it and said it was one 
of the best categories we thought 
up. Of the printable ones, that is.” 
He chuckled again. “Anyway, I 
did alter the end to give you a 
loophole.” 

Gilbert clapped the little man 
on the back. “That was more than 
I thought to do, I must admit.” 
Gilbert looked around the 
office and felt a sudden sharp 
pang of conscience. “Of course 
we’re cheating, aren’t we?” 

“Cheating?” said the little man, 
feigning indignation very well, 
Gilbert thought. “I’m not. We 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



may be anticipating a trifle, but 
that’s a different thing altogether. 
I’ve already looked up Umbro- 
logy for a start. It’s all right, 
there isn’t such a word — not 
yet. As near as I can make out, 
it would be a science of shadows. 
Now all we have to do is find 
the parallaxes.” 

“But — you’re not serious?” 
said Gilbert. 

“Serious? Of course I’m serious. 
Can we help it if we haven’t 
caught up with our category yet? 
Who was the great man, the 
Indian squatting on his haunches 
where he was born or Columbus 
setting out to find a place that no 
one knew existed? We’ve just got 
to have the same kind of faith 
as Columbus had. You’ve got 
brains. As for me, I always found 
it easier to earn my living on a 
trapeze. But I’m no slouch. My 
brain’s been very well preserved 
from all those years of swinging 
about a hundred feet up with 
nothing to do. Oh, I may not have 
been any great shakes in my last 
category, but that wasn’t specific 
enough. In Umbrology, I think 
we’ve got something a man can 
really get his teeth into.” 

“But they’ll find out,” said Gil- 
bert, weakening. 

“Courage, my lad, courage. The 



world’s so complicated these 
days, everyone’s such a specialist, 
that no one can be sure what’s 
actual fact yet and what isn’t. 
What was that one you came out 
with last night — traumograph- 
ist? Well, how many traumo- 
graphists are there in the world? 
Say there’s only one, which is 
more than possible. Then only he 
knows what he’s doing. Anyway, 
if they step in before we’ve gotten 
anywhere, then we’ll just start in 
some other line. The scope’s 
enormous.” 

Why, Gilbert told himself, he 
really does mean it! What was 
more, such confidence was catch- 
ing. It was striking, too, the way 
the little old man made no kind 
of reservation on account of his 
years. He talked as if he were 
immortal, his capacity boundless. 
Standing there now, his head 
cocked to one side, he did look 
like some ageless troll, indefa- 
tigable and of infinite resource. 

“Anyway,” said Mr. Jones. “I’m 
not letting grass grow under my 
feet. Here — ” his grin nearly 
bisected his face — “don’t just 
stand there. Our robot hasn’t 
arrived yet. Give me a hand with 
this filing cabinet. We’re going to 
need it.”

THE END OF ETERNITY by 
Isaac Asimov. Doubleday & Co., 
Inc., $2.95 

T HIS is a tour-de-force by one 
of science fiction’s best-known 
authors and, as far as I know, 
his first venture into time travel. 
It’s a truly fascinating opus, but 
I don’t envy poor Asimov the 
tremendous job of working out 
the paradoxes inherent in any 
time story, particularly the one 
he chose. 

I doubt that there is one rea- 
soning being who hasn’t been 
tempted by the thought of being 



able to go back and alter one’s 
past in order to avoid mistakes 
or tragedy. This is the basis of 
Asimov’s story, though on a cos- 
mic scale. 

A society of so-called Eternals 
has the power to alter the main- 
stream of time to eliminate 
unwanted features from their 
position in Eternity, a sort of 
pseudo-time that exists simultan- 
eously from the beginning of time 
travel in the 27th Century through 
the Hidden Century, up to about 
the 112,000th Century. By means 
of the device of phsio-time, time 
in Eternity is concurrent. 



88 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I must admit that the concepts 
became a bit bewildering now 
and then, but Asimov didn’t stoop 
to take the easy way out to tell 
his story and that calls for liter- 
ary courage. 

The hero is a Technician, the 
class of Eternals whose duty it 
is to compute the Minimum Nec- 
essary Change required to alter 
satisfactorily a given time se- 
quence and to put the change in- 
to effect at the proper instant of 
Time and millimeter of Space. 
Their social status is comparable 
to that of hangman among their 
associates because of the wide- 
spread dislocation and annihila- 
tion of eras that their changes 
entail. 

Do you realize what a monkey- 
wrench a guy like that could be 
if he developed a grudge? Asimov 
does. 

REPRIEVE FROM PARADISE 
by H. Chandler Elliot. Gnome 
Press, Inc., $3.00 

1 ’VE COME to the conclusion 

that this book, like olives, is to 
be either liked or disliked, noth- 
ing in between. It revolves about 
a 40th Century so-called Free- 
man, one of the mindless masses, 
who raises himself to the level of 
the ruling Hierarchy by dint of 
his dissatisfaction with Status 
Quo. 

After World War III, the sole 



civilized survivors, the Poly- 
nesians, assuming the Brown 
Man’s Burden, have organized a 
world society based on freedom 
from want, the duties of the Free- 
man multitudes being reproduc- 
tion and food production only, 
until every possible acre is tilled 
and progress stultified at story 
time. 

Our hero single-handedly over- 
turns the whole shootin’ match, 
which is all right by me, but 
somehow he can’t stick to straight- 
forward action and deliberation. 
Scattered throughout are enough 
parenthetical asides to make a 
script of Uncle Tom’s Cabin. 

The blurb says this is a beauti- 
fully written book. True enough, 
but Chandler has overdone a 
good thing. 

TIME BOMB by Wilson Tucker. 
Rinehart & Co., Inc., $2.75 

T DON’T believe that Tucker 

meant this to be a sequel to 
his The Time Masters, even 
though it’s a follow-up in time 
and has two characters common 
to each. I’m sure he could have 
done his story just as well with- 
out Gilbert and Shirley Nash, but 
I must confess that I sort of go 
for them myself. Especially Shir- 
ley. Telepathy with a kiss — 
wow! Who cares if it’s a one-way 
communication? 

And as for Gilbert . have

you ever heard of Gilgamesh, the 
guy that legend says has lived 
for ten thousand years? Got it? 

The story itself concerns a 
series of Time Bombs, in the lit- 
eral sense, blowing the bejabbers 
out of several high-ranking mem- 
bers of the fanatical Sons of 
America, or Ben’s Boys, as they 
call themselves. Lt. Danforth of 
the bomb squad of the Illinois 
police spots an unusual pattern 
in the explosions, and even though 
canned as a scapegoat, continues 
his investigations on his own, 
with the blessings and unofficial 
aid of Mr. Ramsey, the telepath- 
in-residence of the Illinois Secur- 
ity Police. 

Tucker has a beautiful little 
twist in store at the end that 
might catch you as flat-footed as 
it did me. 

SARGASSO OF SPACE by An- 
drew North. Gnome Press, Inc. 
$2.50 

TT AVING a bad habit of read- 
ing dust jackets before I dig 
into the meat of the stories, I was 
pretty well scared by the lurid 
recap. Funny thing, in resume the 
story sounds as amateurishly 
blud-and-thunderish as the blurb 
come-on hints, but in actuality, 
though unpretentious space opera, 
it makes good adventure reading 
for a couple of carefree hours. 

The crew of a Trader, a space- 



tub comparable to tramp steam- 
ers, bids for and wins the rights 
to a D-class planet. In bidding, 
though, the crew has pooled all 
their money and have none left 
for equipment and supplies. A 
wealthy amateur archeologist puts 
up the money and brings his sci- 
entific helpers along. When it 
turns out that he isn’t really what 
he seems . 

I told you it sounds pretty bad. 

The “Sargasso” part of the 
title alludes to the Earthly Sea of 
Lost Ships, intimating that the 
planet appears to be a graveyard 
of spaceships. That, plus the fact 
that it contains the first identifi- 
able artifacts of the Forerunners, 
an unknown race that had space 
travel way back when, makes the 
purchased planet a pretty valu- 
able hunk of real estate. 

The ending was a bit on the 
abrupt side, but since the cover 
says “A Dane Thorsen-Solar 
Queen Adventure,” simple deduc- 
tion should prove this to be the 
first of a series. Elementary, my 
dear Flotsam. 

SPACEFLIGHT VENUS by 
Philip Wilding. Philosophical Li- 
brary. $2.75 

T HIS is a book printed in Eng- 
land for an American firm. It 
does not specify whether the au- 
thor likewise is British, but that 
would be my guess, even though 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the Earth locale is New Mexico 
and Old Mexico and the protago- 
nists American. 

Regardless of nationality, Wild- 
ing deserves plaudits for perfect- 
ing a particularly annoying de- 
vice of “putting everything” in 
“quotes.” Having a “naturally” 
sensitive “stomach,” I got “dizzy” 
from all this “stop-and-go” writ- 
ing. 

The story concerns the prepa- 
rations for and the actual flight 
to Venus, hewing close to this 
line while tossing out at every op- 
portunity hints of sub-plots and 
sub-sub-plots that never material- 
ize. Considering what the author 
has done with his chosen plot, 
maybe it would have been better 
— but that’s his business. 

After the Venusians have guid- 
ed the Earth ship in to planetfall, 
the most interesting part, to say 
very little, occurs. Anyway, I must 
admit I never met more beautiful 
characters — not a single plain, 
ordinary-looking one, even among 
the Venusians, without whose 
“help” this “book” would never 
have been “written.” 

THE GREEN MAN FROM 
SPACE by Lewis Zarem. E. P. 
Dutton & Co., Inc., $2.50 



T HE author has quite a back- 
ground in aviation, according 
to the jacket. This is apparent in 
the story also. However, in spite 
of what should have been a basic- 
ally tense plot, all the author’s 
dramatic and tragic situations 
fall flat. 

But his inventiveness is com- 
mendable, particularly the sym- 
biosis between the Martian and 
the oxygen-producing algae that 
live like hair on his body. 

The Martian has come to 
Earth seeking new and hardier 
strains of algae and lichens, since 
the native varieties are dying out 
for some obscure reason. His own 
mysteriously propelled ship has 
been destroyed on landing and he 
must return with Earth’s first 
Martian expedition. Of course, 
since the Earth ship is destroyed 
on landing and return must be 
made by Martian ship, turnabout 
is fair play, isn’t it? Well, of 
course it is. 

This is the third author this 
month who has figured out a way 
to get my nanny. He does it by 
liberally larding (and I Do mean 
“Lard”) his story with italics. All 
I can “say” is, (wait) till next 
“month!”

Trap 

By FINN O'DONNEVAN 

Check your dictionary if you think "trap" 
is a simple and uncomplicated word 
... or read this for another definition! 



S AMISH, I am in some need 
of assistance. The situation 
is potentially dangerous, so 
come at once. 

It shows how right you were, 
Samish, old friend. I should never 
have trusted a Terr an. They are 
a sly, ignorant, irresponsible race, 
just as you have always pointed 
out. 

Nor are they as stupid as 
they seem. I am beginning to be- 
lieve that the slenderness of the 



tentacle is not the only criterion 
of intelligence. 

What a sorry mess, Samish! 
And the plan seemed so fool- 
proof . 

Ed Dailey saw a gleam of 
metal outside his cabin door, but 
he was still too sleepy to investi- 
gate. 

He had awakened shortly 
after daybreak and tiptoed out- 
side for a glimpse at the weather. 



Illustrated by WEST

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It was unpromising. There had 
been a heavy rain during the 
night and water dripped from 
every leaf and branch of the sur- 
rounding forest. His station wagon 
had a drowned look and the dirt 
road leading up the mountainside 
was a foot-thick in mud. 

His friend Thurston came to 
the door in pajamas, his round 
face flushed with sleep and Bud- 
dhalike in its placidity. 

“It always rains on the first 
day of a vacation,” Thurston 
stated. “Rule of nature.” 

“Might be a good day for 
trout,” Dailey said. 

“It might; But it is a better day 
for building a roaring fire in the 
fireplace and drinking hot but- 
tered rum.” 

Tj 1 OR eleven years, they had 
* been taking a short autumn 
vacation together, but for differ- 
ent reasons. 

Dailey had a romantic love for 
equipment. The clerks in New 
York’s fancier sports shops hung 
expensive parkas on his high, 
stooped shoulders, parkas such as 
one would wear on the trail of 
the Abominable Snowman in the 
fastnesses of Tibet. They sold 
him ingenious little stoves that 
would burn through a hurricane 
and wickedly curved knives of 
the best Swedish steel. 

Dailey loved to feel a lean can- 
teen against his side and a blued- 



steel rifle over his shoulder. But 
the canteen usually contained 
rum and the rifle was used against 
nothing deadlier than tin cans. 
For in spite of his dreams, Dailey 
was a friendly man, with no 
malice toward bird or beast. 

His friend Thurston was over- 
weight and short of wind, and 
burdened himself only with the 
lightest of fly rods and the small- 
est of shotguns. By the second 
week, he usually managed to steer 
the hunt to Lake Placid, to the 
cocktail lounges that were his 
true environment. There, with an 
incredible knowledge of spoor 
and lair, he placidly hunted the 
pretty vacationing girls instead of 
the brown bear, the black bear, or 
the mountain deer. 

This mild exercise was more 
than adequate for two soft and 
successful businessmen on the 
wrong side of forty, and they re- 
turned to the city tanned and re- 
freshed, with a new lease on life 
and a renewed tolerance for their 
wives. 

“Rum it is,” Dailey said. 
“What’s that?” He had noticed 
the gleam of metal near the 
cabin. 

Thurston walked over and 
poked the object with his foot. 
“Odd-looking thing.” 

Dailey parted the grass and 
saw an open framework box 
about four feet square, con- 
structed of metal strips, and 



TRAP 



93 



hinged on top. Written boldly on 
one of the strips was the single 
word TRAP. 

“Where did you buy that?” 
Thurston asked. 

“I didn’t.” Dailey found a plas- 
tic tag attached to one of the 
metal strips. He pulled it loose 
and read: “Dear Friend, this is a 
new and revolutionary design in 
a TRAP. To introduce the TRAP 
to the general public, we are giv- 
ing you this model absolutely 
free! You will find it a unique 
and valuable device for the cap- 
ture of small game, provided you 
follow precisely the directions on 
the other side. Good luck and 
good hunting!” 

“If this isn’t the strangest 
thing,” Dailey said. “Do you sup- 
pose it was left during the night?” 
“Who cares?” Thurston 
shrugged. “My stomach is rum- 
bling. Let’s make breakfast.” 
“Aren’t you interested in this?” 
“Not particularly. It’s just an- 
other gadget. You’ve got a hun- 
dred like it. That bear trap from 
Abercrombie and Fitch. The 
jaguar horn from Battler’s. The 
crocodile lure from — ” 

“I’ve never seen a trap like 
this,” Dailey mused. “Pretty clev- 
er advertising, just to leave it 
here.” 

“They’ll bill you for it eventu- 
ally,” Thurston said cynically. 
“I’m going to make breakfast. 
You’ll wash the dishes.”

H E WENT inside while Dailey 
turned the tag over and read 
the other side. 

“Take the TRAP to a clearing 
and anchor it to any convenient 
TREE with the attached chain. 
Press Button One on the base. 
This primes the TRAP. Wait five 
seconds and press Button Two. 
This activates the TRAP. Noth- 
ing more is required until a CAP- 
TURE has been effected. Then 
press Button Three to deactiv- 
ate and open the TRAP, and re- 
move the PREY. 

“Warning! Keep the TRAP 
closed at all times except when 
removing the PREY. No opening 
is required for the PREY’S in- 
gress, since the TRAP works on 
the principle of Osmotic Section 
and inducts the PREY directly 
into the TRAP.” 

“What won’t they think of 
next?” Dailey said admiringly. 

“Breakfast is ready,” Thurston 
called. 

“First help me set the trap.” 
Thurston, dressed now in Ber- 
muda shorts and a loud sport 
shirt, came out and peered at the 
trap dubiously. “Do you really 
think we should fool with it?” 

“Of course. Maybe we can 
catch a fox.” 

“What on Earth would we do 
with a fox?” Thurston demanded. 

“Turn it loose,” Dailey said. 
“The fun is in the catching. Here, 
help me lift it.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The trap was surprisingly 
heavy. Together they dragged it 
fifty yards from the cabin and 
tied the chain to a young pine 
tree. Dailey pushed the first but- 
ton and the trap glowed faintly. 
Thurston backed away anxiously. 

After five seconds, Dailey 
pressed the second button. 

The forest dripped and squir- 
rels chattered in the treetops and 
the long grass rustled faintly. The 
trap lay quietly beside the tree, 
its open metal framework glow- 
ing faintly. 

“Come in,” Thurston said. “The 
eggs are undoubtedly cold.” 

Dailey followed him back to 
the cabin, glancing over his shoul- 
der at the trap. It lay in the for- 
est, silent and waiting. 

Samish, where are you? My 
need is becoming increasingly 
urgent. Unbelievable as it will 
sound, my little planetoid is be- 
ing pulled apart before my very 
eyes! You are my oldest friend, 
Samish, the companion of my 
youth, the best man at my mat- 
ing, and a friend of Fregl as well. 
I’m counting on you. Don’t delay 
too long. 

I have already beamed you the 
beginning of my story. The Ter- 
rans accepted my trap as a trap, 
nothing more. And they began to 
use it at once, with no thought 
to the possible consequences. I 
had counted on this. The fantastic 



curiosity of the Terr an species is 
well known. 

During this period, my wife 
was crawling gaily around the 
planetoid, redecorating our hutch 
and enjoying the change from 
city life. Everything was going 
well. 

D URING breakfast, Thurston 
explained in pedantic detail 
why a trap could not function un- 
less it had an opening to admit 
the prey. Dailey smiled and spoke 
of osmotic section. Thurston in- 
sisted that there was no such 
thing. When the dishes were 
washed and dried, they walked 
over the wet, springy grass to the 
trap. 

“Look!” Dailey shouted. 
Something was in the trap, 
something about the size of a 
rabbit, but colored a bright green. 
Its eyes were extended on stalks 
and it clicked lobsterlike claws 
at them. 

“No more rum before break- 
fast,” Thurston said. “Starting to- 
morrow. Hand me the canteen.” 
Dailey gave it to him and 
Thurston poured down a gener- 
ous double shot. Then he looked 
at the trapped creature again and 
went, “Brr!” 

“I think it’s a new species,” 
Dailey said. 

“New species of nightmare. 
Can’t we just go to Lake Placid 
and forget about it?”

“No, of course not. I’ve never 
seen anything like this in my 
zoology books. It could be com- 
pletely unknown to science. What 
will we keep it in?” 

“Keep it in?” 

“Well, certainly. It can’t stay 
in the trap. We’ll have to build a 
cage and then find out what it 
eats.” 

Thurston’s face lost some of its 
habitual serenity. “Now look here, 
Ed. I’m not sharing my vacation 
with anything like that. It’s prob- 
ably poisonous. I’m sure it has 
dirty habits.” He took a deep 
breath and continued. “There’s 
something unnatural about that 
trap. It’s — inhuman!” 

Dailey grinned. “I’m sure they 
said that about Ford’s first car 
and Edison’s incandescent lamp. 
This trap is just another example 
of American progress and know- 
how.” 

“I’m all for progress,” Thurston 
stated firmly, “but in other direc- 
tions. Can’t we just — ” 

He looked at his friend’s face 
and stopped talking. Dailey had 
an expression that Cortez might 
have worn as he approached the 
summit of a peak in Darien. 

“Yes,” Dailey said after a 
while. “I think so.” 

“What?” 

“Tell you later. First let’s build 
a cage and set the trap again.” 
Thurston groaned, but followed 
him. 



W HY haven’t you come yet, 
Samish? Don’t you appre- 
ciate the seriousness of my situa- 
tion? Haven’t I made it clear how 
much depends upon you? Think 
of your old friend! Think of the 
lustrous-skinned Fregl, for whose 
sake I got into this mess. Com- 
municate with me, at least. 

The Terrans used the trap, 
which, of course, was not a trap 
at all, but a matter transmitter. 
I had the other end concealed on 
the planetoid, and fed into it 
three small animals which I found 
in the garden. The Terrans re- 
moved them from the transmitter 
each time — for what purpose, I 
couldn’t guess. But a Terr an will 
keep anything. 

After the third beast passed 
through and had not been re- 
turned, I knew that all was in 
readiness. 

So I prepared for the fourth 
and final sending, the all-impor- 
tant one, for which all else was 
mere preparation. 

They were standing in the low 
shed attached to their cabin. 
Thurston looked with distaste at 
the three cages made of heavy 
mosquito netting. Inside each 
cage was a creature. 

“Ugh,” Thurston said. “They 
smell.” 

In the first cage was the orig- 
inal capture, the stalk-eyed, lob- 
ster-clawed beast. Next came a 



TRAP 



97 



bird with three sets of scaly 
wings. Finally there was some- 
thing that looked like a snake, 
except that it had a head at each 
end. 

Within the cages were bowls 
of milk, plates of minced meat, 
vegetables, grasses, bark — all 
untouched. 

“They just won’t eat anything,” 
Dailey said. 

“Obviously they’re sick,” 
Thurston told him. “Probably 
germ carriers. Can’t we get rid of 
them, Ed?” 

Dailey looked squarely at his 
friend. “Tom, have you ever de- 
sired fame?” 

“What?” 

“Fame. The knowledge that 
your name will go down through 
the ages.” 

“I am a businessman,” Thurs- 
ton said. “I never considered the 
possibility.” 

“Never?” 

T hurston smiled foolishly. 

“Well, what man hasn’t? 
What did you have in mind?” 
“These creatures,” Dailey said, 
“are unique. We will present 
them to a museum.” 

“Ah?” Thurston queried inter- 
estedly. 

“The Dailey-Thurston exhibit 
of creatures hitherto unknown.” 
“They might name the species 
after us,” Thurston said. “After 
all, we discovered them.” 



“Of course they would! Our 
names would go down with Liv- 
ingstone, Audubon and Teddy 
Roosevelt.” 

“Hmm.” Thurston thought 
deeply. “I suppose the Museum 
of Natural History would be the 
place. I’m sure they’d arrange an 
exhibit — ” 

“I wasn’t thinking merely in 
terms of an exhibit,” Dailey said. 
“I was thinking more of a wing 
— the Dailey-Thurston Wing.” 

Thurston looked at his friend 
in amazement. There were depths 
to Dailey that he had never imag- 
ined. “But, Ed, we have only 
three of them. We can’t equip a 
wing with three exhibits.” 

“There must be more where 
these came from. Let’s examine 
the trap.” 

This time the trap contained a 
creature almost three feet tall, 
with a small green head and a 
forked tail. It had at least a dozen 
thick cilia, all of them waving 
furiously. 

“The rest were quiet,” Thurs- 
ton said apprehensively. “Maybe 
this one is dangerous.” 

“We will handle it with nets,” 
Dailey replied decisively. “And 
then I want to get in touch with 
the museum.” 

After considerable work, they 
transferred the thing to a cage. 
The trap was reset and Dailey 
sent the following wire to the 
Museum of Natural History: 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



HAVE DISCOVERED AT LEAST FOUR 
ANIMALS WHICH I SUSPECT TO BE 
NEW SPECIES STOP HAVE YOU 
ROOM FOR SUITABLE EXHIBIT 
STOP BETTER SEND A MAN UP AT 
ONCE. 

Then, at Thurston’s insistence, 
he wired several impeccable char- 
acter references to the museum, 
so they wouldn’t think he was a 
crank. 

That afternoon, Dailey ex- 
plained his theory to Thurston. 
There was, he felt sure, a prim- 
eval pocket isolated in this sec- 
tion of the Adirondacks. Within 
it were creatures which had sur- 
vived from prehistoric times. 
They had never been captured 
because, due to their great an- 
tiquity, they had acquired a high 
degree of experience and caution. 
But the trap — operating on the 
new principle of osmotic section 
— had proved to be beyond their 
experience. 

“The Adirondacks have been 
pretty well explored,” Thurston 
objected. 

“Not well enough, apparently,” 
Dailey said, with irrefutable logic. 

Later, they returned to the 
trap. It was empty. 

1 CAN just barely hear you, 
Samish. Kindly step up the 
volume. Or, better still, get here 
in person. What’s the use of 
beaming me, in the spot I’m in? 
The situation is steadily becom- 



ing more and more desperate. 

What, Samish? The rest of the 
story? It’s obvious enough. After 
three animals had passed through 
the transmitter, I knew I was 
ready. Now was the time to tell 
my wife. 

Accordingly, I asked her to 
crawl into the garden with me. 
She was quite pleased. 

“Tell me, my dear,” she said, 
“has something been bothering 
you of late?” 

“Urn,” said I. 

“Have I displeased you?” she 
asked. 

“No, sweetheart,” I said. “You 
have tried your best, but it just 
isn’t good enough. I am going to 
take a new mate.” 

She stood motionless, her cilia 
swaying in confusion. Then she 
exclaimed, “Fregl!” 

“Yes,” 1 told her, “the glorious 
Fregl has consented to share my 
hutch.” 

“But you forget we were mated 
for life.” 

“I know. A pity you insisted on 
that formality.” And with one 
clever shove, I pushed her into 
the matter transmitter. 

Samish, you should have seen 
her expression! Her cilia writhed, 
she screamed, and was gone. 

I was free at last! A little nau- 
seous, but free! Free to mate with 
the splendid Fregl! 

Now you can appreciate the 
full perfection of the scheme. It

was necessary to secure the Ter - 
rans’ cooperation , since a matter 
transmitter must be manipulated 
from both ends. 1 had disguised 
it as a trap, because Terrans will 
believe anything. And as my mas- 
ter stroke, I sent them my wife. 

Let them try to live with her! 
I never could! 

Foolproof, absolutely foolproof. 
My wife’s body would never turn 
up, because the acquisitive Ter- 
rans keep what they get. No one 
could ever prove anything. 

And then, Samish, then it hap- 
pened. 

T HE cabin’s air of rustic seren- 
ity was gone. Tire tracks 
crossed and recrossed the muddy 
road. The grounds were littered 
with flash bulbs, empty cigarette 
packs, candy wrappers, pencil 
stubs and bits of paper. But now, 
after a hectic few hours, everyone 
was gone. Only a sour taste re- 
mained. 

Dailey and Thurston stood be- 
side the empty trap, staring hope- 
lessly at it. 

“What do you suppose is wrong 
with the damned thing?” Dailey 
asked, giving the trap a frus- 
trated kick. 

“Maybe there’s nothing else to 
capture,” Thurston suggested. 

“There has to be! Why would 
it take four completely alien 
beasts and then no more?” He 
knelt beside the trap and said bit- 

100 



terly, “Those stupid museum peo- 
ple! And those reporters!” 

“In a way,” Thurston said 
cautiously, “you can’t blame 
them — ” 

“Can’t I? Accusing me of a 
hoax! Did you hear them, Tom? 
They asked me how I performed 
the skin grafts!" 

“It’s too bad the animals were 
all dead by the time the museum 
people got here,” Thurston said. 
“That did look suspicious.” 

“The idiotic creatures wouldn’t 
eat. Was that my fault? And 
those newspaper people . 
Really, you would think the met- 
ropolitan newspapers would hire 
more intelligent reporters.” 

“You shouldn’t have promised 
to capture more animals,” Thurs- 
ton said. “It was when the trap 
didn’t produce that they sus- 
pected a hoax.” 

“Of course I promised! How 
should I guess the trap would 
stop with that fourth capture? 
And why did they laugh when I 
told them about the osmotic sec- 
tion system of capture?” 

“They never heard of it,” 
Thurston answered wearily. “No 
one ever heard of it. Let’s go to 
Lake Placid and forget the whole 
thing.” 

“No! This thing must work 
again. It must!” Dailey primed 
and activated the trap and stared 
at it for several seconds. Then 
he opened the hinged top. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Dailey stuck his hand into the 
trap and let out a scream. “My 
hand! It’s gone!” He leaped back- 
ward. 

“No, it’s not,” Thurston assured 
him. 

Dailey examined both hands, 
rubbed them together and in- 
sisted, “My hand disappeared in- 
side that trap.” 

“Now, now,” Thurston said 
soothingly. “A little rest in Lake 
Placid will do you a world of 
good — ” 

Dailey stood over the trap and 
pushed in his hand. It disap- 
peared. Pie reacher farther in and 
watched his arm vanish up to the 
shoulder. He looked at Thurston 
with a smile of triumph. 

“Now I see how it works,” he 
said. “Those animals didn’t come 
from the Adirondaclcs at all!” 

“Where did they come from?” 

“From wherever my hand is! 
Want more, do they? Call me a 
liar? I’ll show them!” 

“Ed! Don’t do it! You don’t 
know what — ” 



But Dailey had already stepped 
feet-first into the trap. His feet 
disappeared. Slowly he lowered 
his body until only his head was 
visible. 

“Wish me luck,” he said. 

“Ed!” 

Dailey held his nose and 
plunged out of sight. 

S AMISH, if you don’t come im- 
mediately, it will be too late! 
I must stop beaming you. The 
enormous Terr an has completely 
ransacked my little planetoid. He 
has shoved everything, living or 
dead, through the transmitter. 
My home is in ruins. 

And now he is tearing down 
my hutch! Samish, this monster 
means to capture me as a speci- 
men! There’s no time to lose! 

Samish, what can he keeping 
you? You, my oldest friend . 

What, Samish? What are you 
saying? You can’t mean it! Not 
you and Fregl! Reconsider, old 
friend! Remember our friendship!

TRAP 



101 



Bodyguard 

By CHRISTOPHER GRIMM 



When overwhelming danger is constantly present, of course a 
man is entitled to have a bodyguard. The annoyance was that 
he had to do it himself . and his body would not cooperate! 




T HE MAN at the bar was 
exceptionally handsome, 
and he knew it. So did 
the light-haired girl at his side, 
and so did the nondescript man 
in the gray suit who was watch- 



ing them from a booth in the 
corner. 

Everyone in the room was 
aware of the big young man, and 
most of the humans present were 
resentful, for he handled himself 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




BODYGUARD 



103 



consciously and arrogantly, as if 
his appearance alone were enough 
to make him superior to anyone. 
Even the girl with him was grow- 
ing restless, for she was accus- 
tomed to adulation herself, and 
next to Gabriel Lockard she was 
almost ordinary-looking. 

As for the extraterrestrials — 
it was a free bar — they were 
merely amused, since to them all 
men were pathetically and irre- 
deemably hideous. 

Gabe threw his arm wide in 
one of his expansive gestures. 
There was a short man standing 
next to the pair — young, as most 
men and women were in that 
time, thanks to the science which 
could stave off decay, though not 
death — but with no other ap- 
parent physical virtue, for plastic 
surgery had not fulfilled its bright 
promise of the twentieth century. 

The drink he had been raising 
to his lips splashed all over his 
clothing; the glass shattered at 
his feet. Now he was not only a 
rather ugly little man, but also a 
rather ridiculous one — or at 
least he felt he was, which was 
what mattered. 

“Sorry, colleague,” Gabe said 
lazily. “All my fault. You must 
let me buy you a replacement.” 
He gestured to the bartender. 
“Another of the same for my 
fellow-man here.” 

The ugly man dabbed futilely 
at his dripping trousers with a 

104 



cloth hastily supplied by the 
management. 

“You must allow me to pay 
your deanery bill,” Gabe said, 
taking out his wallet and extract- 
ing several credit notes without 
seeming to look at them. “Here, 
have yourself a new suit on me.” 
You could use one was implied. 

And that, coming on top of 
Gabriel Lockard’s spectacular ap- 
pearance, was too much. The ugly 
man picked up the drink the bar- 
tender had just set before him 
and started to hurl it, glass and 
all, into Lockard’s handsome face. 

SUDDENLY a restraining hand 
^ was laid upon his arm. “Don’t 
do that,” the nondescript man 
who had been sitting in the 
corner advised. He removed the 
glass from the little man’s slack- 
ening grasp. “You wouldn’t want 
to go to jail because of him.” 
The ugly man gave him a be- 
wildered stare. Then, seeing the 
forces now ranged against him — 
including his own belated pru- 
dence — were too strong, he 
stumbled off. He hadn’t really 
wanted to fight, only to smash 
back, and now it was too late 
for that. 

Gabe studied the newcomer 
curiously. “So, it’s you again?” 
The man in the gray suit 
smiled. “Who else in any world 
would stand up for you?” 

“I should think you’d have 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



given up by now. Not that I mind 
having you around, of course,” 
Gabriel added too quickly. “You 
do come in useful at times, you 
know.” 

“So you don’t mind having me 
around?” The nondescript man 
smiled again. “Then what are you 
running from, if not me? You 
can’t be running from yourself 
— you lost yourself a while back, 
remember?” 

Gabe ran a hand through his 
thick blond hair. “Come on, have 
a drink with me, fellow-man, and 
let’s let bygones be bygones. I 
owe you something — I admit 
that. Maybe we can even work 
this thing out.” 

“I drank with you once too 
often,” the nondescript man said. 
“And things worked out fine, 
didn’t they? For you.” His eyes 
studied the other man’s incredi- 
bly handsome young face, noted 
the suggestion of bags under the 
eyes, the beginning of slackness 
at the lips, and were not pleased 
with what they saw. “Watch your- 
self, colleague,” he warned as he 
left. “Soon you might not be 
worth the saving.” 

“Who was that, Gabe?” the girl 
asked. 

He shrugged. “I never saw him 
before in my life.” Of course, 
knowing him, she assumed he was 
lying, but, as a matter of fact, 
just then he happened to have 
been telling the truth. 



/~kNCE THE illuminators were 
extinguished in Gabriel 
Lockard’s hotel suite, it seemed 
reasonably certain to the man in 
the gray suit, as he watched from 
the street, that his quarry would 
not go out again that night. So 
he went to the nearest airstation. 
There he inserted a coin in a 
locker, into which he put most of 
his personal possessions, reserv- 
ing only a sum of money. After 
setting the locker to respond to 
the letter combination body- 
guard, he went out into the street. 

If he had met with a fatal acci- 
dent at that point, there would 
have been nothing on his body 
to identify him. As a matter of 
fact, no real identification was 
possible, for he was no one and 
had been no one for years. 

The nondescript man hailed a 
cruising helicab. “Where to, fel- 
low-man?” the driver asked. 

“I’m new in the parish,” the 
other man replied and let it hang 
there. 

“Oh? . Females? . Narco- 
phagi? . Thrill-mills?” 

But to each of these questions 
the nondescript man shook his 
head. 

“Games?” the driver finally 
asked, although he could guess 
what was wanted by then. “Dice? 

. Roulette? . Farjeen?” 

“Is there a good zarquil game 
in town?” 

The driver moved so he could

see the face of the man behind 
him in the teleview. A very ordi- 
nary face. “Look, colleague, why 
don’t you commit suicide? It’s 
cleaner and quicker.” 

“I can’t contact your attitude,” 
the passenger said with a thin 
smile. “Bet you’ve never tried the 
game yourself. Each time it hap- 
pens, there’s a . well, the) e’s 
no experience to match it at a 
thrill-mill.” He gave a sigh that 
was almost an audible shudder, 
and which the driver misinter- 
preted as an expression of ecstasy. 

“Each time, eh? You’re a 
dutchman then?” The driver spat 
out of the window. “If it wasn’t 
for the nibble, I’d throw you 
right out of the cab. Without even 
bothering to take it down even. 
I hate dutchmen . anybody 
with any legitimate feelings hates 
’em.” 

“But it would be silly to let 
personal prejudice stand in the 
way of a commission, wouldn’t 
it?” the other man asked coolly. 

“Of course. You’ll need plenty 
of foliage, though.” 

“I have sufficient funds. I also 
have a gun.” 

“You’re the dictator,” the driv- 
er agreed sullenly. 

II 

I T WAS a dark and rainy night 
in early fall. Gabe Lockard 
was in no condition to drive the 



helicar. However, he was stub- 
born. 

“Let me take the controls, 
honey,” the light-haired girl 
urged, but he shook his hand- 
some head. 

“Show you I can do something 
’sides look pretty,” he said thick- 
ly, referring to an earlier and not 
amicable conversation they had 
held, and of which she still bore 
the reminder on one thickly 
made-up cheek. 

Fortunately the car was flying 
low, contrary to regulations, so 
that when they smashed into the 
beacon tower on the outskirts of 
the little town, they didn’t have 
far to fall. And hardly had their 
car crashed on the ground when 
the car that had been following 
them landed, and a short fat man 
was puffing toward them through 
the mist. 

To the girl’s indignation, the 
stranger not only hauled Gabe 
out onto the dripping grass first, 
but stopped and deliberately 
examined the young man by the 
light of his minilume, almost as 
if she weren’t there at all. Only 
when she started to struggle out 
by herself did he seem to remem- 
ber her existence. He pulled her 
away from the wreck just a mo- 
ment before the fuel tank explod- 
ed and the ’copter went up in 
flames. 

Gabe opened his eyes and saw 
the fat man gazing down at him 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



speculatively. “My guardian 
angel,” he mumbled — shock had 
sobered him a little, but not 
enough. He sat up. “Guess I’m 
not hurt or you’d have thrown 
me back in.” 

“And that’s no joke,” the fat 
man agreed. 

The girl shivered and at that 
moment Gabriel suddenly seemed 
to recall that he had not been 
alone. “How about Helen? She on 
course?” 

“Seems to be,” the fat man 
said. “You all right, miss?” he 
asked, glancing toward the girl 
without, she thought, much ap- 
parent concern. 

“Mrs." Gabriel corrected. “Al- 
low me to introduce you to Mrs. 
Gabriel Lockard,” he said, bow- 
ing from his seated position to- 
ward the girl. “Pretty bauble, 
isn’t she?” 

“I’m delighted to meet you, 
Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,” the fat 
man said, looking at her intently. 
His small eyes seemed to strip 
the make-up from her cheek and 
examine the livid bruise under- 
neath. “I hope you’ll be worthy of 
the name.” The light given off 
by the flaming car flickered on 
his face and Gabriel’s and, she 
supposed, hers too. Otherwise, 
darkness surrounded the three of 
them. 

There were no public illumina- 
tors this far out — even in town 
the lights were dimming and not 



being replaced fast enough nor 
by the newer models. The town, 
the civilization, the planet all were 
old and beginning to slide down- 
hill. 

Gabe gave a short laugh, for 
no reason that she could see. 

•T^HERE was the feeling that 
■*- she had encountered the fat 
man before, which was, of course, 
absurd. She had an excellent 
memory for faces and his was not 
included in her gallery. The girl 
pulled her thin jacket closer 
about her chilly body. “Aren’t 
you going to introduce your — 
your friend to me, Gabe?” 

“I don’t know who he is,” Gabe 
said almost merrily, “except that 
he’s no friend of mine. Do you 
have a name, stranger?” 

“Of course I have a name.” The 
fat man extracted an identifica- 
tion card from his wallet and read 
it. “Says here I’m Dominic Bian- 
chi, and Dominic Bianchi is a 
retail milgot dealer. Only he 
isn’t a retail milgot dealer any 
more; the poor fellow went bank- 
rupt a couple of weeks ago, and 
now he isn’t . anything.” 

“You saved our lives,” the girl 
said. “I’d like to give you some 
token of my — of our apprecia- 
tion.” Her hand reached toward 
her credit-carrier with deliberate 
insult. He might have saved her 
life, but only casually, as a by- 
product of some larger scheme,

and her appreciation held little 
gratitude. 

The fat man shook his head 
without rancor. “I have plenty 
of money, thank you, Mrs. Ga- 
briel Lockard. Come,” he ad- 
dressed her husband, “if you get 
up, I’ll drive you home. I warn 
you, be more careful in the future! 
Sometimes,” he added musingly, 
“I almost wish you would let 
something happen. Then my 
problem would not be any prob- 
lem, would it?” 

Gabriel shivered. “I’ll be care- 
ful,” he vowed. “1 promise — I’ll 
be careful.” 

When he was sure that his 
charge was safely tucked in for 
the night, the fat man checked 
his personal possessions. He then 
requested a taxi driver to take 
him to the nearest zarquil game. 
The driver accepted the commis- 
sion phlegmatically. Perhaps he 
was more hardened than the 
others had been; perhaps he was 
unaware that the fat man was 
not a desperate or despairing in- 
dividual seeking one last chance, 
but what was known colloquially 
as a flying dutchman, a man, or 
woman, who went from one zar- 
quil game to another, loving the 
thrill of the sport, if you could 
call it that, for its own sake, and 
not for the futile hope it extended 
and which was its sole shred of 
claim to moral justification. Per- 
haps — and this was the most 

103 



likely hypothesis — he just didn’t 
care. 

Zarquil was extremely illegal, 
of course — so much so that 
there were many legitimate citi- 
zens who weren’t quite sure just 
what the word implied, knowing 
merely that it was one of those 
nameless horrors so deliciously 
hinted at by the fax sheets under 
the generic term of “crimes 
against nature.” Actually the 
phrase was more appropriate to 
zarquil than to most of the other 
activities to which it was com- 
monly applied. And this was one 
crime — for it was crime in law 
as well as nature — in which vic- 
tim had to be considered as guilty 
as perpetrator; otherwise the 
whole legal structure of society 
would collapse. 

TJLAYING the game was fabu- 
lously expensive; it had to 
be to make it profitable for the 
Vinzz to run it. Those odd crea- 
tures from Altair’s seventh planet 
cared nothing for the welfare of 
the completely alien human be- 
ings; all they wanted was to 
feather their own pockets with 
interstellar credits, so that they 
could return to Vinau and buy 
many slaves. For, on Vinau, 
bodies were of little account, and 
so to them zarquil was the equiva- 
lent of the terrestrial game musi- 
cal chairs. Which was why they 
came to Terra to make profits — 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



there has never been big money 
in musical chairs as such. 

When the zarquil operators 
were apprehended, which was not 
frequent — as they had strange 
powers, which, not being defin- 
able, were beyond the law — 
they suffered their sentences with 
equanimity. No Earth court could 
give an effective prison sentence 
to a creature whose life spanned 
approximately two thousand ter- 
restrial years. And capital punish- 
ment had become obsolete on 
Terra, which very possibly saved 
the terrestrials embarrassment, 
for it was not certain that their 
weapons could kill the Vinzz . 
or whether, in fact, the Vinzz 
merely expired after a period of 
years out of sheer boredom. For- 
tunately, because trade was more 
profitable than war, there had al- 
ways been peace between Vinau 
and Terra, and, for that reason, 
Terra could not bar the entrance 
of apparently respectable citizens 
of a friendly planet. 

The taxi driver took the fat 
man to one of the rather seedy 
locales in which the zarquil games 
were usually found, for the Vinzz 
attempted to conduct their opera- 
tions with as much unobtrusive - 
ness as was possible. But the front 
door swung open on an interior 
that lacked the opulence of the 
usual Vinoz set-up; it was down- 
right shabby, the dim olive light 
hinting of squalor rather than for- 



bidden pleasures. That was the 
trouble in these smaller towns — 
you ran greater risks of getting 
involved in games where the play- 
ers had not been carefully 
screened. 

The Vinoz games were usually 
clean, because that paid off bet- 
ter, but, when profits were lack- 
ing, the Vinzz were capable of 
sliding off into darkside practices. 
Naturally the small-town houses 
were more likely to have trouble 
in making ends meet, because 
everybody in the parish knew 
everybody else far too well. 

The fat man wondered whether 
that had been his quarry’s mo- 
tive in coming to such desolate, 
off-trail places — hoping that 
eventually disaster would hit the 
one who pursued him. Somehow, 
such a plan seemed too logical 
for the man he was haunting. 

However, beggars could not be 
choosers. The fat man paid off 
the heli-driver and entered the 
zarquil house. “One?” the small 
green creature in the slightly 
frayed robe asked. 

“One,” the fat man answered. 

Ill 

HP HE WOULD-BE thief fled 
down the dark alley, with 
the hot bright rays from the 
stranger’s gun lancing out after 
him in flamboyant but futile pat- 
terns. The stranger, a thin young 



BODYGUARD 



109 



man with delicate, angular fea- 
tures, made no attempt to follow. 
Instead, he bent over to examine 
Gabriel Lockard’s form, appro- 
priately outstretched in the gut- 
ter. “Only weighted out,” he mut- 
tered, “he’ll be all right. Whatever 
possessed you two to come out 
to a place like this?” 

“I really think Gabriel must 
be possessed . .” the girl said, 
mostly to herself. “I had no idea 
of the kind of place it was going 
to be until he brought me here. 
The others were bad, but this is 
even worse. It almost seems as if 
he went around looking for 
trouble, doesn’t it?” 

“It does indeed,” the stranger 
agreed, coughing a little. It was 
growing colder and, on this world, 
the cities had no domes to protect 
them from the climate, because 
it was Earth and the air was 
breathable and it wasn’t worth 
the trouble of fixing up. 

The girl looked closely at him. 
“You look different, but you are 
the same man who pulled us out 
of that aircar crash, aren’t you? 
And before that the man in the 
gray suit? And before that . ?” 

The young man’s cheekbones 
protruded as he smiled. “Yes, I’m 
all of them.” 

“Then what they say about the 
zarquil games is true? There are 
people who go around changing 
their bodies like — like hats?” 
Automatically she reached to ad- 

110 



just the expensive bit of blue syn- 
thetic on her moon-pale hair, for 
she was always conscious of her 
appearance; if she had not been 
so before marriage, Gabriel would 
have taught her that. 

¥TE smiled again, but coughed 
-“-^instead of speaking. 

“But why do you do it? Why! 
Do you like it? Or is it because 
of Gabriel?” She was growing a 
little frantic; there was menace 
here and she could not under- 
stand it nor determine whether 
or not she was included in its 
scope. “Do you want to keep him 
from recognizing you; is that it?” 

“Ask him.” 

“He won’t tell me; he never 
tells me anything. We just keep 
running. I didn’t recognize it as 
running at first, but now I realize 
that’s what we’ve been doing 
ever since we were married. And 
running from you, I think?” 

There was no change of ex- 
pression on the man’s gaunt face, 
and she wondered how much con- 
trol he had over a body that, 
though second- or third- or fourth- 
hand, must be new to him. How 
well could he make it respond? 
What was it like to step into an- 
other person’s casing? But she 
must not let herself think that 
way or she would find herself 
looking for a zarquil game. It 
would be one way of escaping 
Gabriel, but not, she thought, the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



best way; her body was much too 
good a one to risk so casually. 

IT WAS beginning to snow. 

Light, feathery flakes drifted 
down on her husband’s immobile 
body. She pulled her thick coat 
— of fur taken from some animal 
who had lived and died light- 
years away — more closely about 
herself. The thin young man be- 
gan to cough again. 

Overhead a tiny star seemed 
to detach itself from the pale flat 
disk of the Moon and hurl itself 
upward — one of the interstellar 
ships embarking on its long voy- 
age to distant suns. She wished 
that somehow she could be on it, 
but she was here, on this solitary 
old world in a barren solar sys- 
tem, with her unconscious hus- 
band and a strange man who 
followed them, and it looked as 
if here she would stay ... all 
three of them would stay. 

“If you’re after Gabriel, plan- 
ning to hurt him,” she asked, 
“why then do you keep helping 
him?” 

“I am not helping him. And he 
knows that.” 

“You’ll change again tonight, 
won’t you?” she babbled. “You 
always change after you . meet 
us? I think I’m beginning to be 
able to identify you now, even 
when you’re . wearing a new 
body; there’s something about 
you that doesn’t change.” 



“Too bad he got married,” the 
young man said. “I could have 
followed him for an eternity and 
he would never have been able to 
pick me out from the crowd. Too 
bad he got married anyway,” he 
added, his voice less impersonal, 
“for your sake.” 

She had come to the same con- 
clusion in her six months of mar- 
riage, but she would not admit 
that to an outsider. Though this 
man was hardly an outsider; he 
was part of their small family 
group — as long as she had 
known Gabriel, so long he must 
have known her. And she began 
to suspect that he was even more 
closely involved than that. 

“Why must you change again?” 
she persisted, obliquely approach- 
ing the subject she feared. “You 
have a pretty good body there. 
Why run the risk of getting a bad 
one?” 

“This isn’t a good body,” he 
said. “It’s diseased. Sure, nobody’s 
supposed to play the game who 
hasn’t passed a thorough medical 
examination. But in the places to 
which your husband has been 
leading me, they’re often not too 
particular, as long as the player 
has plenty of foliage.” 

“How — long will it last you?” 
“Four or five months, if I’m 
careful.” He smi'ed. “But don’t 
worry, if that’s what you’re doing; 
I’ll get it passed on before then. 
It’ll be expensive — that’s all.

lit 



Bad landing for the guy who gets 
it, but then it was tough on me 
too, wasn’t it?” 

“But how did you get into this 
. pursuit?” she asked again. 
“And why are you doing it?” Peo- 
ple didn’t have any traffic with 
Gabriel Lockard for fun, not after 
they got to know him. And this 
man certainly should know him 
better than most. 

“Ask your husband.” 

The original Gabriel Lockard 
looked down at the prostrate, 
snow-powdered figure of the man 
who had stolen his body and his 
name, and stirred it with his toe. 
“I’d better call a cab — he might 
freeze to death.” 

He signaled and a cab came. 
“Tell him, when he comes to,” 
he said to the girl as he and the 
driver lifted the heavy form of 
her husband into the helicar, “that 
I’m getting pretty tired of this.” 
He stopped for a long spell of 
coughing. “Tell him that some- 
times I wonder whether cutting 
off my nose wouldn’t, in the long 
run, be most beneficial for my 
face.” 

^'CORRY,” the Vinzz said im- 
personally, in English that 
was perfect except for the slight 
dampening of the sibilants, “but 
I’m afraid you cannot play.” 
“Why not?” The emaciated 
young man began to put on his 
clothes. 

112 



“You know why. Your body is 
worthless. And this is a reputable 
house.” 

“But I have plenty of money.” 
The young man coughed. The 
Vinzz shrugged. “I’ll pay you 
twice the regular fee.” 

The green one shook his head. 
“Regrettably, I do mean what I 
say. This game is really clean.” 
“In a town like this?” 

“That is the reason we can 
afford to be honest.” The Vinzz’ 
tendrils quivered in what the man 
had come to recognize as amuse- 
ment through long, but necessari- 
ly superficial acquaintance with 
the Vinzz. His heavy robe of 
what looked like moss-green vel- 
vet, but might have been velvet- 
green moss, encrusted with oddly 
faceted alien jewels, swung with 
him. 

“We do a lot of business 
here,” he said unnecessarily, for 
the whole set-up spelled wealth 
far beyond the dreams of the 
man, and he was by no means 
poor when it came to worldly 
goods. “Why don’t you try an- 
other town where they’re not so 
particular?” 

The young man smiled wryly. 
Just his luck to stumble on a 
sunny game. He never liked to 
risk following his quarry in the 
same configuration. And even 
though only the girl had actually 
seen him this time, he wouldn’t 
feel at ease until he had made 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the usual body-shift. Was he 
changing because of Gabriel, he 
wondered, or was he using his 
own discoverment and identifica- 
tion simply as an excuse to cover 
the fact that none of the bodies 
that fell to his lot ever seemed 
to fit him? Was he activated sole- 
ly by revenge or as much by the 
hope that in the hazards of the 
game he might, impossible though 
it now seemed, some day win an- 
other body that approached per- 
fection as nearly as his original 
casing had? 

He didn’t know. However, 
there seemed to be no help for it 
now; he would have to wait until 
they reached the next town, un- 
less the girl, seeing him reappear 
in the same guise, would guess 
what had happened and tell her 
husband. He himself had been a 
fool to admit to her that the hulk 
he inhabited was a sick one; he 
still couldn’t understand how he 
could so casually have entrusted 
her with so vital a piece of in- 
formation. 

T HE VINZZ had been locking 
antennae with another of his 
kind. Now they detached, and the 
first approached the man once 
more. “There is, as it happens, a 
body available for a private 
game,” he lisped. “No questions 
to be asked or answered. All I can 
tell you is that it is in good 
health.” 



The man hesitated. “But un- 
able to pass the screening?” he 
murmured aloud. “A criminal 
then.” 

The green one’s face — if you 
could call it a face — remained 
impassive. 

“Male?” 

“Of course,” the Vinzz said 
primly. His kind did have certain 
ultimate standards to which they 
adhered rigidly, and one of those 
was the curious tabu against 
mixed games, strictly enforced 
even though it kept them from 
tapping a vast source of poten- 
tial players. There had also never 
been a recorded instance of hu- 
mans’ and extraterrestrials’ ex- 
changing identities, but whether 
that was the result of tabu or 
biological impossibility, no one 
could tell. 

It might merely be prudence 
on the Vinzz’ part — if it had 
ever been proved that an alien 
life-form had “desecrated” a hu- 
man body, Earthmen would 
clamor for war . for on this 
planet humanity held its self-be- 
stowed purity of birthright dear 
— and the Vinzz, despite being 
unquestionably the stronger, were 
pragmatic pacifists. It had been 
undoubtedly some rabid member 
of the anti-alien groups active on 
Terra who had started the rumor 
that the planetary slogan of 
Vinau was, “Don’t beat ’em; cheat 
’em.”

“It would have to be some- 
thing pretty nuclear for the other 
guy to take such a risk.” The man 
rubbed his chin thoughtfully. 
“How much?” 

“Thirty thousand credits.” 
“Why, that’s three times the 
usual rate!” 

“The other will pay five times 
the usual rate.” 

“Oh, all right,” the delicate 
young man gave in. It was a 
terrific risk he was agreeing to 
take, because, if the other was 
a criminal, he himself would, 
upon assuming the body, assume 
responsibility for all the crimes 
it had committed. But there was 
nothing else he could do. 

TT E LOOKED at himself in the 
mirror and found he had a 
fine new body; tall and strikingly 
handsome in a dark, coarse-fea- 
tured way. Nothing to match the 
one he had lost, in his opinion, 
but there were probably many 
people who might find this one 
preferable. No identification in 
the pockets, but it wasn’t neces- 
sary; he recognized the face. Not 
that it was a very famous or even 
notorious one, but the dutchman 
was a careful student of the 
“wanted” fax that had decorated 
public buildings from time im- 
memorial, for he was ever mind- 
ful of the possibility that he might 
one day find himself trapped un- 
wittingly in the body of one of 

114 



the men depicted there. And he 
knew that this particular man, 
though not an important criminal 
in any sense of the word, was one 
whom the police had been or- 
dered to burn on sight. The abol- 
ishing of capital punishment 
could not abolish the necessity 
for self-defense, and the man in 
question was not one who would 
let himself be captured easily, 
nor whom the police intended to 
capture easily. 

This might be a lucky break 
(or me alter all, the new tenant 
thought, as he tried to adjust him- 
self to the body. It, too, despite 
its obvious rude health, was not 
a very comfortable fit. I can do 
a lot with a hulk like this. And 
maybe I’m cleverer than the ori- 
ginal owner; maybe I’ll be able 
to get away with it. 

IV 

OOK, GABE,” the girl said, 
“don’t try to fool me! I 
know you too well. And I know 
you have that man’s — the real 
Gabriel Lockard’s — body.” She 
put unnecessary stardust on her 
nose as she watched her hus- 
band’s reflection in the dressing 
table mirror. 

Lockard — Lockard’s body, at 
any rate — sat up and felt his 
unshaven chin. “That what he 
tell you?” 

“No, he didn’t tell me anything 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



really — just suggested I ask you 
whatever I want to know. But 
why else should he guard some- 
body he obviously hates the way 
he hates you? Only because he 
doesn’t want to see his body 
spoiled.” 

“It is a pretty good body, isn’t 
it?” Gabe flexed softening muscles 
and made no attempt to deny her 
charge; very probably he was re- 
lieved at having someone with 
whom to share his secret. 

“Not as good as it must have 
been,” the girl said, turning and 
looking at him without admira- 
tion. “Not if you keep on the way 
you’re coursing. Gabe, why don’t 
you . ?” 

“Give it back to him, eh?” 
Lockard regarded his wife ap- 
praisingly. “You’d like that, 
wouldn’t you? You’d be his wife 
then. That would be nice — a 
sound mind in a sound body. But 
don’t you think that’s a little 
more than you deserve?” 

“I wasn’t thinking about that, 
Gabe,” she said truthfully enough, 
for she hadn’t followed the idea 
to its logical conclusion. “Of 
course I’d go with you,” she went 
on, now knowing she lied, “when 
you got your . old body back.” 

Sure, she thought, I’d keep go- 
ing with you to farjeen houses 
and thrill-mills. Actually she had 
accompanied him to a thrill-mill 
only once, and from then on, de- 
spite all his threats, she had re- 



fused to go with him again. But 
that once had been enough; noth- 
ing could ever wash that experi- 
ence from her mind or her body. 

“You wouldn’t be able to get 
your old body back, though, 
would you?” she went on. “You 
don’t know where it’s gone, and 
neither, I suppose, does he?” 

“I don’t want to know!” he spat. 
“I wouldn’t want it if I could get 
it back. Whoever it adhered to 
probably killed himself as soon 
as he looked in a mirror.” He 
swung long legs over the side of 
his bed. “Christ, anything would 
be better than that! You can’t 
imagine what a hulk I had!” 
“Oh, yes, I can,” she said in- 
cautiously. “You must have had 
a body to match your character. 
Pity you could only change one.” 

ITE ROSE from the bed and 
-■•-■-struck her right on the mouth. 
Although he hadn’t used his full 
strength, the blow was painful 
nonetheless. She could feel the 
red of her lipstick become mixed 
with a warmer, liquid red that 
trickled slowly down her freshly 
powdered chin. She wouldn’t cry, 
because he liked that, but 
crumpled to the ground and lay 
still. If, experience had taught 
her, she pretended to be hurt, he 
wouldn’t hit her again. Only 
sometimes it was hard to remem- 
ber that at the actual moment of 
hurt and indignity. He was too 



BODYGUARD 



115 



afraid of prison — - a tangible 
prison. And perhaps, to do him 
credit, he didn’t want to deface 
his own property. 

He sat down on the edge of 
the bed again and lit a milgot 
stick. “Oh, get up, Helen. You 
know I didn’t hit you that hard.” 

“Did you have to beat him up 
to get him to change bodies?” 
she asked from the floor. 

“No.” He laughed reminiscent- 
ly. “I just got him drunk. We 
were friends, so it was a cinch. 
He was my only friend; every- 
body else hated me because of 
my appearance.” His features 
contorted. “What made him think 
he was so damn much better 
than other people that he could 
afford to like me? Served him 
right for being so noble.” 

She stared at the ceiling — it 
was so old its very fabric was 
beginning to crack — and said 
nothing. 

“He didn’t even realize what 
he had here — ” Lockard tapped 
his broad chest with complacence 
— “until it was too late. Took it 
for granted. Sickened me to see 
him taking the body for granted 
when I couldn’t take mine that 
way. People used to shrink from 
me. Girls . .” 

She sat up. “Give me a milgot, 
Gabe.” 

He lighted one and handed it 
to her. “For Christ’s sake, Helen, 
I gave him more than he had a 



right to expect. I was too god- 
damn noble myself. I was well- 
milled; I didn’t have to leave 
half of my holdings in my own 
name — I could have transferred 
them all to his. If I had, then 
he wouldn’t have had the folio 
to hound me all over this planet 
or to other planets, if I’d had the 
nerve to shut myself up on a 
spaceship, knowing he probably 
would be shut up on it with me.” 
He smiled. “Of course he won’t 
hurt me; that’s the one compen- 
sation. Damage me, and he dam- 
ages himself.” 

“But it’s your life he saves, too,” 
she reminded him. 

“My life wouldn’t ever have 
been in danger if it hadn’t been 
for this continual persecution — 
it’s driving me out of this dimen- 
sion! I planned to start a new 
life with this body,” he pleaded, 
anxious for belief and, as a mat- 
ter of fact, she believed him; al- 
most everybody has good inten- 
tions and there was no reason to 
except even such a one as Gabriel 
Lockard, or whatever he was ori- 
ginally named. 

“It was my appearance that 
got me mixed up,” he went on. 
“Given half a chance I could have 
straightened out — gone to Prox- 
ima Centauri, maybe, and then 
out to one of the frontier planets. 
Made something of myself up 
there. But nobody ever gave me 
a chance. Now, as long as he 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



follows me, there’s nothing I can 
do except run and try to hide 
and know all the time I can’t 
escape — I’m already in the 
trap.” 

“What can he do if you stay 
and face him?” 

“I don’t know — that’s the hell 
of it. But he’s smart. Somehow 
he’ll lure me into another game. 
I don’t know how, but that must 
be what he has in mind. What 
else could it be?” 

“What else indeed?” Helen 
asked, smiling up at the ceiling. 

r I 'HE MILGOT vanished in his 
fingers and he took another. 
“It’d take time for him to arrange 
any kind of private game set-up, 
though, and as long as I keep on 
the move, he won’t be able to 
create anything. Unless he runs 
into a floating zarquil game.” He 
smiled mirthlessly. “And he 
couldn’t. Too much machinery, I 
understand. Lucky he doesn’t 
seem to have connections, the 
way I have,” Lockard boasted. “I 
have connections all over the god- 
damn planet. Transferred them 
when I transferred my holdings.” 

She got up, seated herself on 
the vanity bench, and took up a 
brush, which she ran absently 
over the pale hair that shimmered 
down to her paler shoulders. “So 
we keep running all over the 
planet. What would you do if 
I left you, Gabriel?” 



“Kill you,” he said without hesi- 
tation. “Slowly. Even if I have 
to put this precious hulk of mine 
in jeopardy. And you wouldn’t 
like that. Neither would your boy 
friend.” 

“Stop calling him my — ” 

“Wait a minute — maybe there 
is an escape hatch!” His blue eyes 
sharpened unbecomingly. “He 
can’t kill me, but there’s nothing 
to stop my killing him.” 

“How about the police?” She 
tried to speak calmly as she 
passed the brush up and down, 
sometimes not even touching her 
hair. “The body you have won’t 
be any good to you with them 
looking for it. And you’re not a 
professional exterminator, Gabe 

— you wouldn’t be able to get 
away with it.” 

“I can hire somebody else to 
do the killing. Remember I still 
have plenty of foliage. Maybe I 
didn’t leave him exactly half of 
my property, but, what the hell, 
I left him enough.” 

“How will you recognize him?” 
she asked, half-turning, fearfully. 
“He’ll have a new body, you 
know.” 

“You’ll recognize him, Helen 

— you said you could.” At that 
moment she could have wrapped 
her own hair tightly around her 
white throat and strangled her- 
self; she was so appalled by her 
own witless treachery. 

He dragged her to her feet.

“Aah, moonbeam, you know I 
didn’t mean to hurt you. It’s just 
that this whole crazy pattern’s 
driving me out of this world. 
Once I get rid of that life-form, 
you’ll see, I’ll be a different man.” 

As his arms tightened around 
her, she wondered what it would 
be like, a different man in the 
same body. 

V 

^W/HAT MAKES you think 
I would do a thing like 
that?” the little lawyer asked ap- 
prehensively, not meeting the 
bland blue eyes of the man who 
faced him across the old-fash- 
ioned flat-top desk. It was an 
even more outmoded office than 
most, but that did not necessarily 
indicate a low professional status; 
lawyers were great ones for tra- 
dition expressed in terms of out- 
of-date furniture. As for the dust 
that lay all over despite the air- 
conditioning . well, that was 
inescapable, for Earth was a dusty 
planet. 

“Oh, not you yourself person- 
ally, of course,” Gabriel Lockard 

— as the false one will continue 
to be called, since the dutchman 
had another name at the moment 

— said. “But you know how to 
put me in touch with someone 
who can.” 

“Nonsense. I don’t know who 
gave you such libelous informa- 

118 



tion, sir, but I must ask you to 
leave my office before I call — ” 
“It was Pat Ortiz who gave me 
the information,” Lockard said 
softly. “He also told me a lot of 
other interesting things about 
you, Gorman.” 

Gorman paled. “I’m a respect- 
able attorney.” 

“Maybe you are now; maybe 
not. This isn’t the kind of town 
that breeds respectability. But 
you certainly weren’t sunny side 
up when Ortiz knew you. And he 
knew you well.” 

The lawyer licked his lips. 
“Give me a chance, will you?” 
Lockard flushed. “Chance! 
Everybody rates a chance but me. 
Can’t you see, I am giving you 
a chance. Get me somebody to 
follow my pattern, and I promise 
you Ortiz won’t talk.” 

Gorman slipped the plastic 
shells from his face and rubbed 
the pale watery eyes underneath. 
“But how can I get you a man to 
do . the thing you want done? 
I have no connections like that.” 
“I’m sure you can make the 
right connections. Take your 
time about it, though; I’m in no 
hurry. I’m planning to adhere to 
this locale for a while.” 

“How about this man you want 
. put out of the way?” Gorman 
suggested hopefully. “How can 
you be sure he won’t leave?” 
Gabriel laughed. “He’ll stay as 
long as I do.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The little lawyer took a deep 
breath. “Mr. Lockard, I’m sorry, 
but I’m afraid I really cannot do 
anything for you.” 

Gabe rose. “Okay,” he said soft- 
ly. “If that’s your pattern, I’ll just 
put a call through to Ortiz.” He 
turned to go. 

“Wait a minute!” the lawyer 
cried. 

Lockard stopped. 

“Well?” 

Gorman swallowed. “Possibly 
I may be able to do something 
for you, after all ... I just hap- 
pened to have heard Jed Car- 
mody is in town.” 

Gabriel looked at him inquir- 
ingly. 

“Oh ... I thought you might 
have heard the name. He’s a 
killer, I understand, a profession- 
al exterminator ... on the run 
right now. But this is his head- 
quarters — I’m told — and he 
probably would come here. And 
he might be short on folio. Natur- 
ally, I’ve never had any dealings 
with him myself.” 

“Naturally,” Gabe mocked. 

“But I’ll see what I can do.” 
Gorman’s voice was pleading. 
“You’ll wait, Mr. Lockard, won’t 
you? It may be a little while be- 
fore I can find out where he is. 
This isn’t — ” his voice thinned 
— “at all my type of pattern, you 
know.” 

“I’ll wait ... a reasonable 
length of time.” 



The door closed behind him. 
Descending pneumo tubes hissed 
outside. The little lawyer rose 
and went to the window — a 
flat expanse of transparent plastic 
set immovably into the wall of 
the building, an old building, an 
old town, an old planet. As he 
watched the street below, a faint 
half-smile curved his almost 
feminine mouth. He went back 
to the desk and punched a code 
on the vidiphone. 

G ABRIEL crossed the street to 
the little cafe with the gold 
letters for humans only embed- 
ded in the one-way glass front; 
this was a town that adhered 
rigidly to the ancient privileges 
of the indigenous species. He en- 
tered as the shrillness of a vidi- 
phone bell cut through the babble 
inside without in any way check- 
ing it. After a moment, his eyes 
grew accustomed to the dimness 
and he could see his wife waiting 
at a table near the entrance, 
daintily peeling a tigi fruit. 

“Well,” she asked as she put 
a plump pink section into her 
mouth, “did you hire your killer?” 
“Shhh, not so loud!” He threw 
himself into the chair next to 
hers. “Do you want me to get 
into trouble? . And I wouldn’t 
put it past you,” he continued 
without waiting for an answer. 
“Remember, it’s your boy friend’s 
body that gets into trouble.” 

119 



BODYGUARD 



“He’s not my boy friend.” 

A waiter beckoned from the 
vidiphone booth to someone sit- 
ting in the dark shadows at the 
rear of the restaurant. 

“Where is he?” Gabriel ex- 
claimed suddenly. “He must be 
here somewhere. Tell me which 
he is, Helen?” 

His hand gripped her arm 
cruelly, as he swung her around 
on her chair to face each part of 
the room. “Is it that guy over 
there? . That one? . That 
one?” 

She could not repress a start 
of surprise as her eyes met those 
of the thin-featured young man- 
entering the vidiphone booth. He 
returned her gaze with somber 
interest. 

Gabe relaxed. “So that’s the 
one, eh? Not very formidable. 
Looks the way he always should 
have looked.” He lit a milgot. “I’ll 
get Gorman to tip off the zarquil 
boys — only one game in this 
parish, I’m told — that that life- 
form’s not to be allowed to play; 
I’ll make any loss good out of 
my own pocket. That’ll keep him 
onstage for the nonce. He won’t 
leave to get himself fixed up 
somewhere else as long as I stay. 
And I’m going to stay ... to the 
bitter end.” He smiled lovingly 
to himself. 

But it’s not the right man, 
Helen thought gladly. He did 
manage to change, after all. Gabe 



has the wrong man. She felt a 
little sorry for the unknown and 
doomed individual who inhabited 
the delicate, angular body, but it 
was so close to death anyhow 
that the immediate threat didn’t 
matter. And Gabriel — the real 
Gabriel — was safe. 

VI 

HP HE emaciated young man 
entered Gorman’s office and 
locked the door behind him with 
an electroseal. “Disembodiment,” 
he identified himself. 

“So you did get a new body, 
Jed,” the lawyer remarked affa- 
bly. “Very good packaging. 
Makes you look like a poet or 
something.” 

“Good as a disguise, maybe, 
but one hell of a lousy hulk.” 
The young man hurled himself 
into the chair by the desk. Even 
Gorman winced at the cruel treat- 
ment accorded such obvious fra- 
gility. “Gimme a milgot, Les. This 
thing — ” he indicated his body 
with contempt — “is shot to 
Polaris. Won’t last more than a 
few months. Some bargain I got.” 

Gorman lit a stick himself. 
“The guy who got your body 
didn’t get such a bargain either,” 
he murmured through a cloud of 
purple smoke. 

“At least he’ll live. If he’s 
lucky. I wish he’d hurry and get 
himself picked up, though, so I 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



could collect the folio and jet 
off. Can’t go after it now. Hounds 
will be sniffing after anybody 
gravitating around the place 
where I’ve stashed it until they’re 
sure they have me. They don’t 
know where the money is exactly, 
of course, or they’d soak it up, 
but they’ve got an idea of the 
general sector.” 

“Want me to pick it up for 
you, Jed?” the lawyer asked, his 
pale, flickering eyes brushing 
across the young man’s dark in- 
tense ones. 

“Oh, sure. All I need is for you 
to know where it is and all I’d 
see would be your rocket trail.” 
The young man leaned across 
the expanse of littered steel. “Or 
do you know where it is, Les?” 
he asked softly. “Do you know 
where it is and are you just hiber- 
nating until I’m safely out of the 
way?” 

In spite of himself, Gorman 
could not help moving back. 
“Don’t be a fool, Jed,” he said in 
a voice that was several tones 
higher. “If I knew where it was 
. well, you’re not very frighten- 
ing in your present embodiment, 
you know.” 

“Don’t be too sure of that, 
Gorman. And you were always 
yellow; anybody could frighten 
you.” He began to laugh shrilly. 
“Hey, that’s good. Get it? Any 
body, see?” 

The lawyer did not join in the 



mirth. “How are you fixed for 
cash?” he asked abruptly. 

r T , HE YOUNG man’s face split 
in a sardonic grin. “Why do 
you think I risked public com- 
munion with a darkside character 
like you, Les? I shot my wad 
making the shift. I could use a 
little loan. You know I have mil- 
lions stashed away,” the young 
man said angrily as Gorman re- 
mained silent. “I’ll pay you as 
soon as the hounds take the 
chump who’s leasing my hulk.” 
“Maybe you can earn some 
money.” Gorman toyed with a 
paperweight. “Did you get a look 
at that big blond guy in the cafe 

— the one I told you about on 
the phone?” 

“Yeah. Nice life-form he had 
with him. I wouldn’t mind being 
in that body.” 

“Seems he wants somebody ex- 
terminated. And I told him I 
heard Jed Carmody was in the 
parish and might be interested.” 
The young man sprang to his 
feet, furious. “You what?” 

“Turn your antigravs off. I told 
him Jed Carmody was in the 
parish. Are you Jed Carmody?” 
The other sat down and ex- 
haled heavily. “You’re on course 

— I’m nobody just now.” 

“Any identification come with 

the package?” 

“Naah, what’d you expect? . 
But why tell anyone that Jed 



BODYGUARD 



121 



Carmody’s hitting the locality?” 

“I thought you might be inter- 
ested in picking up a little free- 
falling foliage.” 

The young man shook his head 
impatiently. “Risk having this 
hulk heated up for a half-credit 
crime? Don’t be an alien, Gor- 
man. I’m going to hit subsoil un- 
til this other life-form gets col- 
lected by the hounds.” 

“Thought you might like to 
do it to help me out,” Gorman 
murmured. 

The other man stared. “How do 
you fit into the pattern?” Gor- 
man shrugged. “Oh, I get it: this 
guy’s putting the barometer on 
you?” 

Gorman nodded. 

“Bad landing, counselor. But 
you don’t seriously expect . ? 
Hey!” The wide-set eyes glistened 
darkly. “I got it! Why don’t you 
get this guy who’s got my hulk 
to make the flight? Send some- 
body out to magnetize him like 
you thought he was the real Car- 
mody, see?” 

G ORMAN looked hopeful for 
a moment; then shook his 
thin-haired head. “No reason to 
think the man is an extralegal.” 
“Anyone who finds himself in 
my hulk damn well has to be if 
he wants to stay out of the sar- 
dine box. Look, what’s the first 
thing he’s going to want to do 
when he finds out what he’s been 



stuck with? Go to another parish 
and hop hulks, right? And he’ll 
need plenty of foliage to do it.” 

“Maybe he has money,” Gor- 
man suggested wearily. 

“No fuel lost finding out.” The 
young man rubbed his hands to- 
gether gleefully. “If he takes on 
the flight, though, see that he gets 
my flash, huh? Rosy up the pic- 
ture.” 

“Maybe he can kill whoever 
this Lockard has in mind without 
getting picked up by the police. 
Such things have happened; oth- 
erwise you wouldn’t have been 
able to run around loose so long, 
Jed.” 

“An amateur? Not a chance! 
Besides, just to make sure, 
little. .” He stopped in the act 
of tapping his chest. “Say, I don’t 
have a name, do I? What’s a good 
epithet for me, Les? Something 
with class.” 

The lawyer studied the pale, 
bony face for a moment or two. 
“How about John Keats?” he sug- 
gested. “Simple and appropriate.” 

The other man thought. “Yeah, 
I like that. John Keats. Plain, but 
not like John Smith. Subtle. I’ll 
buy it. Okay, so you think I’m 
going to take my view-finder off 
the fake Carmody? I’m going to 
adhere to that life-form closer 
than Mary’s lamb. So when he 
knocks off whoever the other guy 
wants novaed, I can yell doggie. 
Then the hounds get him — with 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



my flash on him and all, they’ll 
never have the nebula of a notion 
that they don’t have all of me. 
I pick up the foliage and rock 
out to some place where I can 
buy me a new jewel case, no ques- 
tions asked. Don’t fret, Gorman 
— you’ll get your nibble. I’ve 
never played the game with you, 
have I?” 

Instead of answering, Gorman 
asked a question of his own. 
“Kind of hard on the other guy, 
isn’t it?” 

“He rates it for sticking me 
with a piece of statuary like this. 
Look at it this way, Les — in 
his own hulk he would’ve died; 
this way he’s got a chance to 
live. Yeah, get him to make the 
flight, Les. You can charm the 
juice out of a lemon when you 
want to; it’s your line of evil. 
And don’t let on you know he’s 
not the genuine article.” 

“I won’t,” Gorman sighed. “I 
only hope I can persuade him to 
take on the flight. Don’t forget 
it’s important to me too, Jed — 
uh, John.” 

“Make planetfall, then,” John 
Keats said. “So long, Les.” 

“Good-by, Johnny.” 

VII 

H ELEN was brushing her long 
creamy hair at the dressing 
table when there came a tap at 
the door to the living room of 



the suite — a tap so light that it 
could have been someone acci- 
dentally brushing past in the cor- 
ridor outside. Gabriel sprang up 
from the bed where he had been 
lolling, watching her and stood 
for a moment poised on the balls 
of his feet, until the knock was 
repeated more emphatically. He 
started toward the other room. 

“But who could be knocking at 
the door at this hour?” she asked. 
“It’s almost one . Gabe, do be 
careful.” — 

He halted and looked back at 
her suspiciously. “Why do you 
say that? You know you don’t 
care what happens to me?” That 
last was a question rather than 
a statement and had a plaintive 
quaver which failed to touch her. 
Once she had still been able to 
feel some compassion; now, noth- 
ing he said or did could arouse 
more than fear and disgust. 

“If somebody knocks you over 
the head when you open the 
door,” she murmured, smiling at 
her own image, “then who will 
be there to protect me?” 

A choked sound came from the 
back of the man’s throat. He 
turned toward her, his fists 
clenched. She braced herself for 
the blow, but then the knock 
came for the third time and her 
husband reluctantly continued on 
into the living room, letting the 
door shut behind him. She rose 
and pushed it open a little. She

had a pretty good idea of who 
might be expected, but was not 
especially perturbed, for she knew 
the real Gabriel Lockard, in 
whatever guise he might be now, 
was safe from her husband. And 
she was curious to see what the 
exterminator looked like. 

The door to the corridor was 
out of her line of vision, but she 
could hear it as it opened. “Lock- 
ard?” a deep, husky voice whis- 
pered. “Gorman sent me.” 

“Come in, Mr. Carmody. You 
are Carmody?” 

“Shhh,” the husky voice 
warned. “If you get me into 
trouble, I’m not going to be able 
to complete your pattern for you, 
am I?” 

“Sorry — I wasn’t thinking. 
Come on in.” 

A heavy tread shook the an- 
cient floorboards, and presently 
the man responsible for it came 
into the girl’s sight. He was a 
huge creature, bigger even than 
Gabriel, with dark hair growing 
low to a point on his forehead, 
and a full-lipped sensual face. 
Then, as he spoke, as he moved, 
she knew who he was. She pressed 
close against the wall of the bed- 
room, her slender shoulders shak- 
ing, her handkerchief stuffed into 
her mouth, so that the sound of 
her wild, irrepressible laughter 
would not reach her husband’s 
ears. 

“Sit down, Carmody,” Gabriel 



said cordially, as he handed the 
newcomer a glass, “and make 
yourself comfortable.” There was 
a brief, rather awkward silence. 
“Well,” Gabriel went on, with a 
smile that would have been thor- 
oughly ingratiating to anyone 
who hadn’t known him, “I don’t 
suppose I have to cruise around 
the asteroids with you?” , 

“No,” Carmody replied, look- 
ing speculatively toward the bed- 
room door. “No, you don’t.” 

t 

G ABRIEL followed the direc- 
tion of his gaze. “Worried 
about somebody overhearing? 
There’s only my wife in there. 
She’s listening, all right, but she 
won’t talk. Come in, Helen.” 
Carmody rose automatically as 
she came in, his dark eyes follow- 
ing every line of her long, smooth 
body in its close-fitting, though 
opaque, negligee of smoke-gray 
silk — a fabric which, through 
extreme scarcity, had come into 
fashion again. 

“Sit down,” Gabriel ordered 
brusquely. “We’re not formal 
here.” 

Carmody sat, trying not to 
stare at the girl. She began to 
mix herself a drink. “Moonbeam,” 
her husband said, “you won’t tell 
anybody about this little peace * 
conference, will you?” 

“No,” she said, looking at Car- 
mody. “I won’t talk.” She lifted , 
her glass. “Here’s to murder!” 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Helen,” Gabriel insisted, un- 
able to rationalize the vague un- 
easiness that was nagging at him, 
“you won’t dare say anything to 
anybody? Because, if you do, 
you’ll regret it!” 

“I said I wouldn’t talk. Have I 
ever broken my word?” 

“You’ve never had the chance.” 
But it would be incredible that 
she should have the temerity to 
betray him. After all, she was his 
wife. She should stick to him out 
of gratitude and self-interest, for 
he was rich, at least, and he 
wasn’t exactly repulsive. And he’d 
been good to her. All men lost 
their tempers at times. 

“Let’s get down to business, 
huh?” Carmody said harshly. 
“Whom do you want knocked 
off?” 

“I don’t know his name,” Ga- 
briel replied, “but I can describe 
him.” 

After he had finished doing so, 
there was a small pause. Car- 
mody was silent. Helen turned 
back to the bar; her face was 
concealed from the men. Her 
body shook a little. Lockard 
thought she was crying, and won- 
dered again whether his confi- 
dence in her was entirely justi- 
fied. 

“I think maybe I know the 
guy,” Carmody went on. “Only 
been around the — the parish a 
couple of days, if it’s the life-form 
I mean.” 



“Must be the one,” Lockard 
told him. “Think you can do it?” 
“A cinch,” Carmody assured 
him. 

AS HELEN Lockard emerged 
from the door marked Fe- 
males; Human and Humanoid, 
and rounded the turn in the corri- 
dor, a brawny arm reached out 
of a vidiphone booth and yanked 
her inside. The girl gave a startled 
cry, then relaxed. “Oh, it’s you; 
you gave me a turn.” 

“You’re not afraid? You know 
who I am, then?” 

She nodded. “You’re the real 
Gabriel Lockard.” His big body 
was pressing hers in the close- 
fitting confines of the booth. In 
some ways it could be considered 
more attractive than her hus- 
band’s. “Why are you hiding 
here?” 

“I’m not hiding, I’m lurking,” 
he explained. “Wouldn’t do for 
me to appear too openly. The 
police — that is, the hounds — 
are on Carmody’s trail. I don’t 
want them to find me.” 

“Oh.” She pulled away from 
him. She mustn’t let her interest 
be aroused in a body so soon to 
be discarded. 

“I’ve been looking for an op- 
portunity to talk to you since 
last night,” he growled, the only 
way he could gentle a voice as 
deep as the thick vocal cords of 
the body produced. “But your

husband is always around. You 
haven’t told him who I was, have 
you?” 

She shook her head slowly, re- 
proachfully. “I wouldn’t do that. 
I wouldn’t have told him about 
the other one either, but I . 
well, I guess I jumped or some- 
thing when I caught sight of him 
and Gabe mistakenly picked it 
up.” 

There was a tense silence as 
they stood almost pressed against 
one another. “It’s easy to see how 
you got into Carmody’s body,” 
she went on, speaking a little too 
rapidly, “but how did you happen 
to get into this particular line of 
evil?” 

“Simple — that lawyer your 
husband went to see sent scouts 
out to have Carmody picked up. 
And they flushed me. Naturally 
I would have turned down the 
job if he hadn’t happened to men- 
tion for whom it was. 

“That other man is the real 
Carmody now, isn’t he?” She 
looked up at him. Her eyes were 
gray or green; he couldn’t deter- 
mine which. “So it doesn’t matter 
even if he does get killed.” 

“But how can he get killed?” 
the big man reminded her with a 
gentleness completely out of 
keeping with the ferocity of his 
appearance. “I’m not a killer, 
please believe me — I have never 
killed anybody and I hope I 
never have to.”

CHE HAD never thought about 
^ who he was — who he had 
been — before he started play- 
ing the game. Gabriel Lockard, 
of course. But what had Gabrifel 
Lockard been? Surely not the 
narco-filled, fear-ridden dilettante 
the man — the body, at least — 
was now. He couldn’t possibly 
have been or the hulk wouldn’t 
have stood up so well under the 
treatment it was getting from its 
current tenant. But all that didn’t 
seem to matter. All she wanted 
was the rightful man in his right- 
ful body, and that seemed almost 
impossible of achievement. 

‘What do you intend to do?” 
she asked, almost sharply. 

“I don’t know,” he said. “By 
agreeing to kill this — John 
Keats he calls himself — I felt 
I had the situation in hand. And 
I suppose I have, in a sense. But 
the end result is a stalemate. I’ve 
been following him around just 
to make everything look on 
course for your husband until I 
decide what to do. Sometimes, 
though, I get the curious feeling 
that Keats is following me.” 

“Maybe for the same reason 
you’ve been following Gabriel?” 
Helen touched his arm gingerly; 
it was more muscular than her 
husband’s. “This isn’t a bad body, 
you know — maybe he sets some 
store by it.” 

“But that doesn’t make sense!” 
he said, impatiently shaking off 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION. 



her hand, not wanting her to like 
this criminal’s body that, despite 
its superficial attractiveness, fitted 
him no more easily than any of 
the others. “Logically, it seems to 
me, he should try to get as far 
away from his own hulk as possi- 
ble. Duck! Here comes your 
husband!” 

He blocked her with his wide 
body as Gabriel Lockard’s swung 
past the booth, its perfect fea- 
tures marred by a frown. “Okay,” 
he whispered, as Lockard round- 
ed the corner, “rock back to your 
table and act angry because he’s 
late.” 

He watched until Gabriel had 
retraced his steps and gone back 
to the hotel dining room; then 
sauntered in the same direction. 
From the next booth, John Keats 
stared sullenly after the depart- 
ing figure. He had been straining 
his ears, but the booths were 
effectively soundproofed; all he 
could learn was that the stranger 
had developed some kind of quick 
understanding with Lockard’s 
wife and, knowing the potentiali- 
ties of his former packaging, this 
saddened rather than surprised 
the young man. 

He punched Gorman’s number 
without turning on the visual. 
“Disembodied,” he said curtly. 
“Look here, Gorman, I’ve been 
wondering — just who is this 
life-form supposed to be sending 
to the joyful planetoids?” 



“I haven’t any idea,” Gorman’s 
voice said curiously. “Didn’t seem 
any of my evil, so I didn’t ask. 
And I don’t suppose Lockard 
would have told me. Why do you 
want to know?” 

“Because I don’t see him taking 
a fix on anybody except Lockard’s 
wife and I don’t hold with ex- 
terminating females except may- 
be by accident. Besides, I kind 
of radiate for that tigi myself.” 
The lawyer’s voice definitely 
showed interest. “Isn’t there any- 
body else he could possibly be 
after?” 

“Well — ” John Keats gave a 
sick laugh — “there’s only one 
other possible flight pattern. It’s 
kind of extradimensional, but 
sometimes I think maybe he’s 
after me.” 

There was a long pause. “Ab- 
surd,” the little lawyer said 
thoughtfully. “Absurd. He doesn’t 
even know who you are.” 

Pale blood surfaced under tHe 
young man’s transparent skin. “I 
never thought of that, but you’re 
wrong. He does. He’s got to. It 
was a private game.” His voice 
thickened and he had to stop for 
coughing. “When you told him he 
was Jed Carmody, naturally he 
could figure out who was squat- 
ting in his hulk.” 

“But magnetizing him was your 
own idea, Johnny,” Gorman 
pointed out gently. “Besides, 
that’s no reason he should be

after you; what’s the percentage 
in it? And, anyhow, where does 
Lockard fit into this?” He seemed 
to be asking the question of him- 
self as much as of the other man. 

“Yeah,” John Keats muttered, 
“that’s what I’ve got to find out.” 
“Me, too,” Gorman half-whis- 
pered. 

“What did you say?” 

“I said tell me when you find 
out; I’m sort of curious myself.” 

VIII 

£4T OOK, Gorman,” Carmody 
said, “I’m not working for 
you; I’m working for Lockard. 
What’s the idea of sending for 
me this hour of the night?” 

“Then why did you come this 
hour of the night when I asked 
J you to?” the lawyer inquired, 
leaning back in his chair and 
smiling. 

The big man hesitated and 
shrugged. “Can’t say, myself. 
Curiosity, maybe. But you can 
hardly expect me to violate my 
employer’s confidence?” 

Gorman laughed. “You get 
your ideas from the viddies, don’t 
you? Only don’t forget that you’re 
the villain, not the hero, of this 
piece, fellow-man.” 

Carmody, completely taken 
aback, stared at him — the little 
alien couldn’t know! And, further- 
more, he was mistaken — Car- 
mody, Lockard, the dutchman, 



had done nothing wrong, com- 
mitted no crime, violated no 
ethic. On the other hand, he had 
done nothing right either, nothing 
to help himself or any other. 
“What do you mean?” he finally 
temporized. 

“Tell me this — Lockard hired 
you to kill the man who goes 
under the name of John Keats, 
didn’t he?” 

“Yes, but how did you know 
that?” He was beginning to have 
the same primitive fear of Gor- 
man that he had of the Vinzz; 
only it was more natural for an 
extraterrestrial to have apparent- 
ly supernatural powers. 

“Keats told me — and Keats, of 
course, is the real Carmody.” 

“So you found out?” 

“Found out!” Gorman laughed. 
“I knew it all along. Does a man 
keep any secrets from his law- 
yer?” 

“If he’s smart, he does.” Car- 
mody absently beat his hand on 
the desk. “This Keats isn’t too 
smart, though, is he?” 

“No ... he isn’t a very bright 
guy. But it was his idea that this 
would be a fine method of getting 
you out of the way. And not too 
bad an idea, either . You had 
to be disposed of, you know,” he 
explained winningly. “And how 
nice to have hounds do it for us. 
Of course we had no idea of iyho 
your quarry was.” 

“I can see your point of view,” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

Carmody said ironically. “But why 
tell me now?” And then he 
thought he saw the answer. “Are 
you afraid I’ll really kill him?” 
The lawyer shook his head and 
smiled back. “Afraid you really 
won’t.” He placed the tips of his 
fingers together. “I am prepared 
to double whatever Lockard is of- 
fering you to make sure that 
Keats, with Carmody inside him, 
is definitely put out of the way 
forever.” 

S O EVEN here there was no 
basis of trust — none of the 
reverse honor that legend com- 
monly assigned to extralegals. 
Carmody got up. Even seated, he 
had towered above the lawyer. 
Standing, he was like a larger- 
than-life statue of doom — of 
doom, Gorman nervously Itoped, 
pointing in the desired direction. 

“And if I refuse?” Carmody 
asked. 

Gorman moved his chair back 
uneasily. “I might persuade Keats 
that he could risk one murder in 
his present shape, if it was to 
insure his ultimate safety.” 

“Meaning it would be a good 
idea for him to kill me?” 

“Meaning it would be an excel- 
lent idea for him to kill you.” 
“Look here, Gorman,” Car- 
mody said, in a low voice that 
gradually increased in volume. He 
could no longer restrain the anger 
that had been seething up in him 



for all the years of his wandering. 
“I’ve had enough of all this, hid- 
ing, running, shifting bodies and 
now hiring out as a killer. Be- 
cause I’m an honest man. Maybe 
you’ve never seen one before, so 
take a good look at me. You may 
never have the chance again.” 

“I am looking and I see Jed 
Carmody. Not my idea of the pro- 
totype of honesty.” 

“But I don’t feel like Jed Car- 
mody.” 

“Tell that to the hounds.” Gor- 
man laughed uproariously. “By 
law, you’re responsible for Car- 
mody’s crimes. Of course, if they 
put you away or — as they’d un- 
doubtedly prefer — accidently ex- 
terminate you in the line of duty, 
and then suspect Carmody hulk- 
hopped, they might look around 
some more. But there wouldn’t be 
any percentage in that for you, 
especially if you were dead.” 

“I know, I know,” Carmody re- 
torted impatiently. “You can’t tell 
me anything I haven’t told my- 
self.” He paused for a moment. 
“This is a good body, though,” he 
added. “Almost as good as my old 
one.” 

Gorman raised his eyebrows. 
“You can’t be referring to the cor- 
pus currently going by the epithet 
of John Keats?” 

“The name was your idea, I 
take it. No, that wasn’t my origi- 
nal body.” 

“Oh, so you’re a dutchman, eh? 



BODYGUARD 



129 



A thrill boy?” There was con- 
tempt, even from such as Gorman. 
“Getting a lot of free falls out of 
all this, are you?” 

Carmody tried to ignore this, 
but he couldn’t. It wasn’t true, he 
told himself; he had suffered 
years of playing the game and de- 
rived no pleasure from those suf- 
ferings — no pleasure at all. But 
he would not stoop to argue with 
Gorman. “Maybe I can get away 
with this body to one of the fron- 
tier planets,” he mused. “At least 
I can make a run for it; at least 
that would be a worthwhile kind 
of running.” 

“Brave words!” the lawyer 
sneered. “But rather risky to put 
into action. Don’t you think the 
best thing to do would be just go 
ahead with the pattern as set? 
How much did Lockard offer 
you?” 

“Half a million credits.” 

Gorman sucked in his breath. 
“You’re lying, of course, but I’ll 
match that. Carmody — Keats — 
has ten times that amount and 
maybe more hidden away where 
I can lay my hands on it as soon 
as I’m sure he’s where he can’t 
hurt me. It’s worth half a million 
to me. And, in the remote in- 
stance that you’re telling the 
truth, you can’t turn down a mil- 
lion credits . whoever you are, 
dutchman!” 

“Oh, can’t I?” Carmody went to 
the door; then turned. “It may in- 



terest you to know that I’m worth 
a hundred times that amount and 
maybe more.” 

The lawyer laughed skeptical- 
ly. “If you have enough money to 
buy your way, then why are you 
doing this?” 

Carmody frowned. “You would- 
n’t understand . I’m not sure 
I understand myself.” The door 
slammed behind him. Descend- 
ing pneumos hissed. 

“Just talking with his elbows,” 
Gorman said comfortingly to him- 
self. “He’ll do it. He’s got to do 
it.” But he wasn’t altogether con- 
vinced. 

IX 

A S CARMODY left the office 
building, John Keats’ figure 
emerged from the shadows of a 
nearby doorway. He looked up at 
the golden rectangle of Gorman’s 
window and then toward the 
direction in which Carmody had 
gone; and bit his lip irresolutely. 
After a moment’s reflection, he 
chose to follow his old body. 
Somehow he didn’t have much 
confidence in Gorman any more; 
not that he’d ever really trusted 
him. In their line of evil you 
couldn’t afford to trust anybody. 
He had made a mistake. But it 
could still be rectified. 

If the big man was aware of 
his tracker, he did not seem to 
care. He moved purposefully in 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the direction of the hotel, scorn- 
ing the helicabs that swooped 
down to proffer their services, 
striding through the brilliantly lit 
avenues gay with music and the 
dark alleys mournful with the 
whine of the farjeen wires as if 
they were all the same. 

The hotel was on one of the 
avenues, because the Lockards al- 
ways had only the best of what- 
ever there was to be had. Car- 
mody crossed the almost deserted 
lobby in swift strides and took the 
pneumo to the seventh floor. 
Knowing that his body could have 
only one objective in that place, 
Keats took the stairs to the base- 
ment. 

Carmody sprang out of the 
pneumo exit and ran down the 
corridor to bang lustily on the in- 
tricately embossed metal door of 
the Lockards’ suite. After a mo- 
ment, the girl, again in negligee, 
opened it. Her green-gray eyes 
widened when she saw who the 
late visitor was, and she put a 
finger to her lips. “Shh, Gabe’s 
asleep; let’s not wake him unless 
it’s necessary.” She closed the 
door softly behind him. “What is 
it . Jed?” 

He was so choked with excite- 
ment that he could hardly get the 
words out. “Helen; will you make 
a break with me for Proxima Cen- 
tauri? They won’t ask any ques- 
tions there, if we can get there. 
And from Proxima we can go — ” 



“But your body?” 

“The hell with my body.” He 
gripped her arms with powerful 
hands. “You mean much more to 
me than that worthless hulk.” 
“But, Jed, Gabe’ll never let us 
go ... ” Proxima Centauri — 
that had been Gabriel’s dream, 
too . 

His hands pressed so hard into 
her flesh, she knew there would be 
bruises on her skin; was she al- 
ways doomed to fall in love with 
men who would leave marks on 
her? “Let him try to stop us. I’m 
bigger than he is, now.” 

She looked up at him. “You al- 
ways were, darling. But he has in- 
fluence, though he wouldn’t need 
it; he could simply set the police 
on you.” 

“That’s the chance we’re going 
to have to take . But perhaps 
I’m asking too much. I haven’t the 
right to ask you to take such 
risks,” he added bitterly. “I was 
thinking only of myself, I see, not 
of you.” 

“Oh, no, Jed!” 

ftWTOS you talking to, 
” Helen?” a drowsy voice 
asked from the bedroom. It was 
followed by the comely person of 
Gabriel himself, fastening his 
dressing gown. “Oh, hello, Car- 
mody.” His face lighted up avidly, 
all sleepiness vanishing like a 
-spent milgot. “Did'you do it al- 
ready?” 



BODYGUARD 



131 



“No, I didn’t. And, what’s more, 
I’m not going to do it!” 

Lockard looked astonished. 
“But what’s .wrong? You said you 
would.” 

Carmody sighed. “Yes, I know 
I did. I was stalling. That’s what 
I’ve always done — stalled, put 
things off, hesitated to make de- 
cisions. Well, I’ve made my de- 
cision now.” 

“You’re not afraid of him?” 
Lockard said in a voice that was 
meant to be taunting and 
emerged as querulous. “A little 
pipsqueak like that Keats? Or 
maybe half a million credits isn’t 
enough for you? Is that it?” 

That was enough for the man 
whose emaciated body was tor- 
turedly cramped in the air-con- 
ditioning vent and further agon- 
ized by the strain of repressing 
the cough that sought to tear its 
way out of his chest. He had 
found out what he wanted to 
know and, as he inched his way 
back down to the basement, he 
was already making plans for get- 
ting even with all those he now 
knew to be enemies. It had been 
a conspiracy against him from the 
start; the hounds probably were- 
n’t even aware that he was in 
town. It was Gorman who had 
told him they knew of his gen- 
eral whereabouts — Gorman, the 
good friend who had suggested he 
change bodies, knowing that 
whatever hulk he wound up with 

132 



was bound to be more vulnerable 
than his primal form. And Gor- 
man would pay . 

“More than enough,” Carmody 
replied, as unaware of the fact 
that he had lost one-third of his 
audience as he had been that he 
was addressing three rather than 
two listeners. “Only I’m not a 
killer.” 

“But I understood you were 
supposed to be a professional ex- 
terminator?” 

“Jed Carmody is a killer. Only 
I’m not Jed Carmody.” 

lockard moved backward and 
stared at the still bigger man. 

Lockard retreated still further. 
“You — you’re him! You were all 
along!” He whirled on his wife. 
“And you knew, you double- 
crosser! Knew and didn’t tell me! 
By God, I’ll break every bone in 
your body!” 

“Lay a hand on her and I’ll 
break every bone in my body!” 
Lockard stopped where he was. 
“It doesn’t mean anything to me 
any more, you see,” Carmody ex- 
plained. “I wanted it when I did- 
n’t have anything else. But now I 
have Helen. I could kill you, you 
know. As Carmody, an acknow- 
ledged exterminator, I have no- 
thing to lose. But I’m letting you 
live, as a hostage for Helen . 
And, besides, as I’ve been busy 
trying to convince everybody all 
evening, I am not a murderer.” 
He turned to the girl. “Will you 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



come with me to Proximo, Hel- 
en?” 

“Y-yes, Jed,” she said, looking 
apprehensively at her husband. 

“Gather your packs. I’m going 
to the air office to make the ar- 
rangements.” Carmody consulted 
his chronometer. “It’s three o’- 
clock. I should be back by eight 
or so. Get some sleep if you can.” 

Her wide frightened eyes 
turned again toward her husband. 

“Here.” Jed tossed her the gun 
Gorman had given him. “If he 
tries anything, use it.” 

“Yes, Jed. But ... ” 

“Don’t worry; I have another 
one.” 

The door slammed behind him. 
“Gimme that gun, you little 
tramp!” Lockard snarled, twisting 
it out of her flaccid hand.

JpARMODY marched out of 
the hotel and turned left in 
the direction of the airstation 
which stayed open all night. He 
had walked a short distance when 
suddenly a high voice came out 
of the darkness behind him, “Not 
so fast, Mr. Carmody,” and a 
hard knob was pressed in his back. 

“Mr. Keats, I believe,” Car- 
mody said, wondering why he 
wasn’t frightened. 

“Right.” The other coughed at 
some length. “You thought you 
were pretty smart, didn’t you, 



foisting me off with a hulk that 
wasn’t only shopworn but hot?” 

“Your intentions weren’t exact- 
ly noble either, were they, Mr. 
Keats?” 

“I want my frame back!” 

Suddenly the idea came to Car- 
mody, and so wonderful it was he 
could hardly throttle his voice 
down to calmness. “Shooting me 
won’t help you get it back. In 
fact, it might make it rather dif- 
ficult.” 

“You have your choice between 
going back to the zarquil house 
wiht me and switching or getting 
your current insides burned out.” 

Carmody exhaled a small hiss- 
ing sigh that he hoped would not 
be recognized as obvious relief to 
the man behind him. “You’ll have 
to pay. I haven’t enough folio on 
me.” 

“I’ll pay; I’ll pay,” the voice 
snarled. “I always pay. But you’ll 
come peacefully?” he asked in 
some surprise. 

“Yes. Matter of fact, I’ll be 
glad to get out of this body. No 
matter how much I try, somehow 
I can never manage to keep it 
clean . Gently, now, you don’t 
want to muss up a body you’re 
planning to occupy yourself, now 
do you?” 

“This is too easy,” Keats’ voice 
murmured dubiously. “Maybe it’s 
another trap . .” 

“You’re always going to ima- 
gine traps, Mr. Exterminator,

whether they’re there or not. You 
and Lockard both — people who 
run must have something to run 
from, and half the time it’s not 
there and half the time, of course, 
it is; only you never know which 
is which — ” 

“You talk too much,” the man 
behind him snarled. “Shut up and 
keep moving.” 

“Back again?” the Vinzz at the 
door asked. The present Carmody 
was a little startled. Somehow he 
had thought of the Vinzz as too 
remote from humanity to be able 
to distinguish between individual 
members of the species. “I’m 
afraid neither of you is qualified 
to play.” 

“No reason why we shouldn’t 
have a private game, is there?” 
John Keats demanded belliger- 
ently. 

The Vinzz’ tendrils quivered. 
“In that case, no, no reason at 
all. If you want to be so unsport- 
ing and can afford it. It will cost 
you a hundred thousand credits 
each.” 

“But that’s twice what I had to 
pay last week!” Keats protected 
angrily. 

The Vinzz shrugged an anten- 
na. “You are, of course, at liberty 
to take your trade elsewhere, if 
you choose.” 

“Oh, hell,” the temporarily po- 
etic-looking killer snarled. “We’re 
stuck and you know it. Let’s get it 
over with!” 

134 



I T WAS odd to come out of un- 
consciousness back into the 
thin young man’s body again. 
More uncomfortable than usual, 
because the criminal’s body had 
been in such splendid physical 
condition and this one so poor — 
now worse than before, because 
it had been worked far beyond its 
attenuated capabilities. The indi- 
viduality that had originally been 
Gabriel Lockard’s, formerly 
housed in Jed Carmody’s body, 
now opened John Keats’ eyes and 
looked at the Vinzz who stood 
above him. 

“The other human has been 
told you awakened before him 
and have already departed,” the 
Vinzz explained. “He has violence 
in his heart and we do not care 
for violence on our doorstep. Bad 
for business.” 

“Has he gone already?” 

The Vinzz nodded. 

“How long has he been gone?” 
He scrambled to his feet and in- 
vestigated the clothing he wore. 
Carmody had been in too much 
of a hurry to clean himself out. 
There was some money left, a 
container of milgot sticks, and a 
set of electroseals. 

“He has just left.” The extra- 
terrestrial’s eyes flickered in what 
might have been surprise. “Don’t 
you wish to avoid him?” 

“No, I must go where he goes.” 
The Vinzz shrugged. “Well, it’s 
your funeral in the most literal 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sense of the word.” He sighed as 
the young man plunged out into 
the darkness. “But, from the ob- 
jective viewpoint, what a waste 
of money!” 

The massive, broad-shouldered 
figure of Jed Carmody was still 
visible at the end of the street, so 
the thin man slowed down. He 
wanted to follow Carmody, to 
keep close watch on where he was 
going and, if necessary, guide him 
in the right direction, though he 
didn’t think he’d have to do 
that. But he had no intention of 
overtaking him. Carmody might 
not want openly to use the gun 
the former tenant had so carefully 
left him, but with his physique 
he could break the fragile body 
of John Keats in two, if he so de- 
sired, and he probably did. 

Meanwhile Carmody — the real 
Carmody — having been deprived 
of an immediate revenge, had be- 
gun to realize how much better 
the situation was as it now stood. 
If he killed Keats out of hand, 
he might miss out on half a mil- 
lion credits, because it was his 
custom to get cash in advance for 
all his flights, and this was his 
flight pattern now. He wouldn’t 
trust that Lockard life-form to 
defoliate after the job was done. 

Of course he himself had plen- 
ty of money stashed away, but 
every half million helped. It 
would be no trouble to find the 
sickly Keats later. And there was 



no reason the hounds should get 
him — Carmody — after all, the 
other had been rocketing around 
in his body and he hadn’t been 
caught. Carmody had allowed 
himself to be stampeded into 
panic. He smiled. Gorman would- 
n’t ever be able to chart any pat- 
tern like that, or like anything, 
again. Fortunately there was no 
permanent harm done, and a half 
million credits to cover the zar- 
quil losses, with a nice profit left 
over. Maybe he could even beat 
Lockard up to a million; that one 
was obviously a coward and a 
fool. A few threats should be 
enough to get him to hand over. 

Carmody paused for a moment 
outside the hotel. It still took 
some nerve to walk boldly into 
the brightly lit lobby. 

THHE automatic doors slid open 
■*- as he entered. At the same 
time, the pneumo gates lifted 
and Gabe Lockard came out, 
dragging a heavily veiled Helen, 
their luggage floating behind 
them. Both stopped as they 
caught sight of the killer; Lockard 
paled — Helen gasped. 

Too bad I have to leave her in 
the tentacles of this low life-form, 
Carmody thought with regret, but 
there was no help for it. He ap- 
proached them with what he 
thought was an ingratiating smile. 
“Mr. Lockard, I’ve decided to give 
you another chance.” 



BODYGUARD 



135 



It was an unhappy choice of 
word. “Oh, you have, have you!” 
the big blond man yelled. “I 
thought I did have another 
chance. And now you’ve spoiled 
that, too!” 

“What do you mean by that?” 
Carmody demanded, his thick 
dark brows almost meeting across 
his nose. 

“I figured on getting away be- 
fore you came back,” Gabriel bab- 
bled in a frenzy, “but you’d have 
found me anyway. You always 
find me. I’m sick of this running. 
There’s only one way to stop you, 
only one way to be sure that, 
whatever happens to me, you 
won’t be around to enjoy it.” 
“Listen, Lockard, you’re mak- 
ing a mistake. I — ■” 

“The only mistake I made was 
in hiring somebody else to do the 
job I should have done myself.” 
He pulled out the gun — Car- 
mody’s own gun — and fired it. 
He wasn’t a good shot, but that 
didn’t matter. He had the flash on 
full blast and he pumped and 
pumped and pumped the trigger 
until the searing heat rays had 
whipped not only the killer’s as- 
tonished body but all through the 
lobby. The few people still there 
rushed for cover as rug, chairs, 
potted palms were shriveled by 
the lancing holocaust. There was 
a penetrating odor of burning fab- 
ric and frond and flesh. 

Helen let out a wail as Car- 

136 



mody, more ash than man, fell 
to the charred carpet. “Gabe, 
Gabe, what have you done!” 
The gun dropped from his 
hand to rejoin its owner. His face 
crumpled. “I didn’t really mean 
to kill . only to scare him . 
What’ll I do now?” 




GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You’ll run, Mr. Lockard,” John 
Keats’ body said as he entered 
the devastated lobby. “You’ll run 
and run and run. He’s dead, but 
you’ll keep on running forever. 
No, not forever — I apologize — 
some day you’ll get caught, be- 
cause the hounds aren’t amateurs 



like you and . him . He 
pointed to the crumbling, black- 
ened corpse, keeping his hand 
steady with an effort for, God 
knew, he was the biggest amateur 
of them all. 

Lockard licked his lips and 
gazed apprehensively around.

Frightened faces were beginning 
to peer out from their places of 
concealment. “Look, Carmody,” 
he said in a low, stiff voice, “let’s 
talk this over. But let’s get out of 
here first before somebody calls 
the hounds.” 

“All right,” the thin man smiled. 
“I’m always willing to talk. We 
can go over to Gorman’s office. 
They won’t look for us there right 
away.” 

“How’ll we get in?” 

“I have a ’seal,” Keats said. 
Surely one of the electroseals he 
carried must belong to Gorman’s 
office. It was a chance he’d have 
to take. 

XI 

K EATS had to try five differ- 
ent seals before he found the 
one that opened the lawyer’s of- 
fice. He was afraid his obvious 
lack of familiarity would arouse 
Lockard’s suspicions, but the big 
man was too much preoccupied 
with his own emotions. 

An unpleasantly haunting aro- 
ma of cooked meat seeped out 
from inside. “For Christ’s sake, 
Carmody, hurry!” Lockard 
snarled, and gave a sigh of relief 
as the door swung open and the 
illuminators went on, lighting the 
shabby office. Gorman was there. 
His horribly seared body lay 
sprawled on the dusty rug — quite 
dead. 



“You — you killed him?” Gab- 
riel quavered. The sight of mur- 
der done by another hand seemed 
to upset him more than the mur- 
der he himself had just commit- 
ted. 

The thin man gave a difficult 
smile. “Carmody killed him.” 
Which was undoubtedly the truth. 
“The gun that did it is in his 
pocket. I had nothing to do with 
it.” His eyes sought for the oneb. 
behind the veil. He wanted the 
girl who stood frozenly by the 
door to know that this, at least, 
was the truth. 

Gabriel also stayed near the 
door, unable to take his eyes off 
the corpse. In death Carmody and 
Gorman, the big man and the 
small man, had looked the same; 
each was just a heap of charred 
meat and black ash. No blood, no 
germs — all very hygienic. “You’re 
smart, Carmody,” he said from 
taut lips. “Damn smart.” 

“I’m Keats, not Carmody! Re- 
member that.” He dropped into 
the chair behind the desk. “Sit 
down, both of you.” Only Gabriel 
accepted the invitation. “Why 
don’t you take that thing off your 
face, Mrs. Lockard? You aren’t 
hiding from anybody, are you?” 
Gabriel gave a short laugh. 
“She’s hiding her face from every- 
body. I spoiled it a little for her. 
She was going to sell me out to 
. the guy in your body.” 

Keats’ hand tightened on the 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



arm of his chair. Lose his temper 
now and he lost the whole game. 
“It was a good body,” he said, not 
looking at the thing on the rug, 
trying not to remember the thing 
on the rug on the other side of 
town. “A very good body.” 
Through the veil, Helen’s shad- 
owy eyes were fixed on his face. 
He wanted to see what Lockard 
had done to her, but he couldn’t 
tear off the veil, as he longed to 
do; he was afraid of the expres- 
sion that might be revealed on 
her face — triumph when there 
should have been anguish; an- 
guish when there should have 
been triumph. 

“Not as good as the one I have 
here.” Lockard thumped his own 
chest, anxious to establish the val- 
ue of the only ware he had left. 

“Matter of opinion,” Keats said. 
“And mine was in better shape.” 
“This one isn’t in bad condi- 
tion,” Gabriel retorted defensive- 
ly. “It could be brought back to 
peak in' short order.” 

“You won’t have much oppor- 
tunity to do it, though. But may- 
be the government will do it for 
you; they don’t pamper prisoners, 
I understand, especially lifers.” 

G ABRIEL whitened. “You’re 
an extralegal, Carmody — 
Keats,” he whined. “You know 
your course. You know how to 
hide from the hounds . I’m 
a — a respectable citizen.” He 



spread his hands wide in exag- 
gerated helplessness. “Strictly an 
amateur, that’s what I am — I ad- 
mit I’ve been playing out of my 
league.” 

“So?” 

“I’m worth a lot of money, 
Keats, a hell of a lot. And half of 
it can be yours, if you . change 
bodies with me.” 

Keats’ angular face remained 
expressionless, but there was a 
sharp cry from the girl — a cry 
that might have been misunder- 
stood as one of pain, but wasn’t. 

Gabriel turned toward her, and 
his upper lip curled back over his 
teeth. “I’ll throw her in to the 
bargain. You must have seen her 
when she wasn’t banged up so you 
know she’s not permanently dis- 
figured. Isn’t she worth taking a 
risk for?” 

Keats shrugged. “If the hounds 
pull you down, she’ll be a legal 
widow anyway.” 

“Yes, but you’d have no . 
chance with her in the body you 
now have . No chance,” he re- 
peated. His voice broke. “Never 
had a chance.” 

“Go ahead, feel sorry for your- 
self,” the other man said. “Nobody 
else will.” 

Gabriel’s face darkened, but he 
also had to control his temper to 
gain what he fancied were his 
own ends. “You won’t deny that 
this hulk is better than the one 
you have now?” 



BODYGUARD

“Except that there’s one thing 
about the head that I don’t like.” 
Gabriel stared in bewilder- 
ment. His body was beyond cri- 
ticism. “What is it you don’t like 
about the head?” 

“There’s a price on it now.” 
Gabriel pressed his spine 
against the back of the chair. 
“Don’t play the innocent, Car- 
mody. You’ve killed people, too.” 
“Well, sure, but not out in the 
open like that. You know how 
many people saw you blast him? 
Too many. 1'f you’re going to ex- 
terminate somebody, you do it 
from a dark doorway or an alley 
— not in a brilliantly lit hotel lob- 
by, and you blast him in the back. 
But there’s no use giving you les- 
sons; it’s not likely you’ll ever be 
able to use them where you’re 
going.” 

Gabriel suddenly sagged in his 
chair. He looked down at the floor. 
“So you won’t do it?” 

Keats grew apprehensive. He 
hadn’t expected the big man to 
give in to despair so soon — it 
might spoil all his plans and leave 
him trapped in this sick unwanted 
body. He lit a milgot. “I didn’t 
say that,” he pointed out, trying 
to sound unconcerned. “Matter of 
fact, I might even consider your 
proposition, if . .” 

There was hope in Lockard’s 
eyes again. It made Keats a little 
sick to think of the game he had 
to play with the other; then he 

140 



thought of the game the other had 
played with him, the game the 
other had played with his wife, 
and the faint flickering of compas- 
sion died out in him. “What do 
you want?” Gabriel asked. 

Keats took a moment before he 
answered. “I want all of what 
you’ve got.” 

Gabriel uttered an inarticulate 
sound. 

“You can’t take it with you, 
colleague. If we hulk-hop, it’s got 
to be tonight, because the 
hounds will be baying on your 
trail any moment. You wouldn’t 
have the chance to transfer the 
property to my name and, if you 
take my word that I’ll hand over 
half afterward, you’re just plain 
out of this dimension . Think 
of it this way, Lockard — what’s 
worth more to you, a couple of 
lousy billions or your freedom?” 

“All right, Carmody,” Lockard 
said dully, “you’re the dictator.” 

XII 

T HE Vinzz’ eyes flickered in 
astonishment. “Another pri- 
vate game? However . .” he 
shrugged eloquently. “It will cost 
you a hundred thousand credits 
each, gentlemen.” 

“No discount for a steady cus- 
tomer?” Keats inquired lightly, 
though he was trembling inside. 

The Vinzz’ tendrils quivered. 
“None. You ought to be glad I 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



didn’t raise the price again.” 

“Why didn’t you?” he couldn’t 
help asking. 

The Vinzz looked steadily into 
the man’s eyes. “I don’t know,” 
it answered at last. “Perhaps I 
have been so long on this planet 
that I have developed a sentimen- 
tal streak ... In any case, I am 
going back to Vinau the day after 
tomorrow ...” 

“For God’s sake,” Lockard, his 
senses so confused with fear and 
apprehension that he was able to 
catch only fragments of their talk, 
screamed, “pay him what he asks 
and don’t haggle!” 

“All right,” Keats agreed. “The 
lady will wait for me here,” he 
told the Vinzz. 

The extraterrestrial quivered 
indecisively. “Most irregular,” it 
murmured. “However, I cannot re- 
fuse a slight favor for such an old 
customer. This way, madam.” 

ABRIEL Lockard opened 
Gabriel Lockard’s eyes. 

‘ Well,” the Vinzz who stood 
above him lisped, “how does it 
feel to be back in your own body 
again?” 

Gabriel got up and stretched. 
He stretched again, and then an 
expression of wonderment came 
over his handsome features. “I 
feel . exactly the way I felt 
in . any of the others,” he said 
haltingly. “I’m not comfortable in 
this one either. It’s not right — it 



doesn’t fit. My own body . 

“You’ve grown out of it,” the 
green one told him, not unkindly. 
“But you will be able to adjust to 
it again, if you’ll give it a 
chance 

“There’s that word again.” Gab- 
riel winced. “I’m beginning to re- 
spond to it the way my . pre- 
decessor did. Do we ever really 
get another chance, I wonder?” 
“Take my advice.” The Vinzz’ 
face became almost human. “This 
is costing my people money, but 
we’ve made enough out of you 
and your — shall we say? — friends. 
It is a shame,” it murmured, “to 
prey upon unsophisticated life- 
forms, but one must live. How- 
ever, I’ll tell you this: The com- 
pulsion will come over you again 
and again to play the game — your 
body will torment you unbear- 
ably and you will long for relief 
from it, but you must conquer 
that desire or, I warn you, you 
will be lost to yourself forever. 
It’s a pattern that’s enormously 
difficult to break, but- it can be 
broken.” 

Gabriel smiled down at the lit- 
tle green creature. “Thanks, col- 
league. I’ll remember that advice. 
And I’ll take it.” 

“The other is still asleep,” the 
Vinzz told him. “This time I 
thought it best to let you awaken 
first. Good-by, and . good luck.” 
“Thanks, fellow-man,” Gabriel 
said. The Vinzz’ tendrils quivered.

TTELEN awaited him in an an- 
teroom, her veil flung back 
so that he could see her poor, 
marred face. Anger rose hotly in 
him, but he pushed it down. Her 
suffering had not been meaning- 
less and revenge was already con- 
summated. 

“Gabriel!” Her voice was taut. 
“. Jed!” 

“Gabriel,” he smiled. “The gen- 
uine, original Gabriel — accept no 
substitutes.” 

“I’m so glad.” Her lips formed 
the words, for she had no voice 
with which to make them. 

“Come.” He took her arm and 
led her out into the quiet street. 
It was almost daylight and the 
sky was a clear pearl gray. Again 
a star detached itself from the 
translucent disk of the Moon and 
sped out into the Galaxy. 

Soon, he thought, we’ll be on a 
starship like that one, leaving this 
played-out planet for the new 
worlds up in the sky. 

“You’re going to let Gabe — the 
other Gabriel — go?” she asked. 

He bent his head to look at her 
swollen face. “You’re free, Helen; 
I have my body back; why should 
we concern ourselves with what 
happens to him? He can’t hurt us 
any more.” 

“I suppose you’re right,” she 
muttered. “It seems unfair . 
She shivered. “Still, you have no 
idea of the things he did to me — 
the things he made me do .

She shivered again. 

“You’re cold. Let’s get started.” 
“But where are we going?” She 
placed her hand on his arm and 
looked up at him. 

“Back to the hotel to pick up 
your luggage. And then — I still 
think Proxima is a good idea, 
don’t you? And then perhaps far- 
ther out still. J’m sick of this old 
world.” 

“But, Je — Gabriel, you must be 
mad! The police will be waiting 
for you at the hotel.” 

“Of course they’ll be waiting, 
but with a citation, not handcuffs.” 
She looked at him as if he had 
gone extradimensional. He 
laughed. “What your ex-husband 
didn’t know, my dear, was that 
there was a reward out for Jed 
Carmody, dead or alive.” 

Her face was blank for a mo- 
ment. “A reward! Oh, G-G-G-Gab- 
riel!” The girl erupted into hys- 
terical laughter. 

“Shhh, darling, control your- 
self.” He put his arm around her, 
protectively, restrainingly. “We’ll 
be conspicuous,” for already the 
Sun’s first feeble rays were begin- 
ning to wash the ancient tired 
streets with watery gold. “Think 
of the reward we’re going to get 
— five thousand credits, just for 
us!” 

She wiped her eyes and pulled 
down her veil. “Whatever will we 
do with all that money!” 

“I think it would be nice if we

turned it over to the hotel,” he 
smiled. “I made rather a shambles 
of their lobby when, pursuant to 
my duty as a solar citizen, I ex- 
terminated the killer Carmody. 
Let’s give it to them and leave 
only pleasant memories behind us 
on our journey to the stars.” And 
he couldn’t help wondering 
whether, if things got really 
tough, somewhere up in those 
stars he could find another zar- 
quil game.
