SPECTRA OF CERTAIN CEPHEID STARS 





He had been a perfectly 
ordinary astronomer — 
until he met a woman 
with very peculiar needs! 



On FRIDAYS, I LEAVE the Obser- 
vatory as the sun sets down in the 
west. Driving my brown BMW 
down from the mountain solitudes 
and across the valley floor, I arrive 
at the Observatory’s subsidiary 
offices adjacent to the University. 
We are not officially a part of the 
University. Students rarely come to 
visit us. 

As I drive, I wear polarized 
glasses of a gray tint especially de- 
veloped for the Gemini astronaut 
program some years back. In this 
manner, I protect my reserves of 
visual purple from the sudden flare 
of opposing headlights. There is no 
telling when this kind of encounter 
is likely to occur and so I prepare 
for the probability. The roadbed 
curves through the sinuous 
geosynclines of the folded moun- 
tains. 

I leave the staff parking lot at 
four P.M. pulling out into the steep 
driveway. I try to drive as fast as I 
can catching all the turns like Phil 
Hill used to do. Hill is one of my 



personal heros. Do you know why? 
Because he finished up ahead of the 
game and retired, that is why. I 
take the turns at optimum speed. 
There are coarse gravel skirts on 
either side of the blacktop and a 
long winding stretch quite near the 
Observatory where there is no white 
line. You never know what might 
be coming the other way. 

At the Observatory, my duties en- 
tail tending the instruments four 
nights each week in association with 
Dr. Emaus Corweiller, the Chief 
Observer. My position is one ofj 
considerable envy in the field since 
Corweiller is among the most acute 
and most accomplished sky watch- 
ers now at work. He is also an as- 
tronomical theoretician of amazing 
versatility. He has a wholehearted 
way of accepting all cosmological 
concepts and then dismissing them 
as irrelevant. I am his senior assis-i 
tant. He is an effusive, happy manj 
much given to animated conversa-j 
tions and he gives me his full ap- 
proval for my tedious personal re- 
searches into the observable spectra 
of certain Cepheid variable stars. 

Corweiller and I are on watch to- 
gether Tuesdays, Wednesdays and 
Thursdays working on the Obser- 
vatory’s current study, an assigned 
task of plotting galaxies in the 
Cetus region as part of a coopera- 
tive worldwide nebulae study. On 
Saturday nights, we photograph bi- 
nary star systems. This is Corweil- 
ler’s personal project. Although 
much recent data of stellar 



6 



GALAXY 



phenomena has been gathered by 
monitoring radio emissions, nothing 
can be quite so spontaneous as ac- 
tual observation and photographs. 
This is our area of expertise. 

My work begins after sundown as 
I prepare the dome for our night’s 
work. First, fans are turned on cool- 
ing the great mirror to equal the ex- 
pected outdoor temperature; then, as 
the Chief Observer enters the dome 
from his study, I open the canopy 
revealing the patch of heavens that 
we are interested in. Corweiller 
takes great precautions to check and 
recheck all of my coordinates and to 
assure that the great ’scope is accu- 
rately trained. He monitors the ces- 
sium clock which controlls the 
tracking mechanisms. He reviews 
the previous night’s watch plan and 
carefully examines the film 
magazines and the photographic 
plates which I have prepared for his 
use during the night. I do not mind 
this constant review of my work. 
Corweiller is very precise and it is 
important in our work that the ele- 
ments of error are eliminated. 

We exchange silent greeting as he 
enters the tiny elevator that takes 
him up to the observer’s platform. I 
have the night plan ready for him. 
My calculations are exact and he is 
always appreciative. I keep close 
watch on several chronometers and 
time the exposures for him. Occa- 
sionally we will discuss the compo- 
sition and light sensitive chemical 
qualities of various film emulsions. 
Other than that, we rarely speak. At 

VARIATIONS IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRA 



four A.M. I take tea up to him in a 
stainless steel thermos and in these 
close moments, up there in the ob- 
server’s chair, he allows me to peer 
into the depths of the universe and 
gaze out at the indelible wonders of 
the stars. I sleep in the daytime. 
The nights emerge, a precession of 
clockwork. 

On Mondays and Fridays, 1 pre- 
pare my own work on the varying 
intensities and rhythms of the puls- 
ing Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars. 
There is some speculation to date 
that our own star, Sol, may be just 
such kind of star and that it is in 
fact irregularly variable. I would 
hope that my own researches based 
on the changes of the visible spectra 
in certain of these variables would 
lead us to some conclusions about 
the nature of our own stellar envi- 
ronment. What I am doing is de- 
cidedly routine but I take pleasure 
in knowing the measure of 
scheduled days. 

★ ★ ★ 

Each Friday, after my ride down 
the mountain roads, and across the 
valley, I come to a block of apart- 
ment buildings close to the Univer- 
sity. These are two-story brick 
buildings with steel casement win- 
dows. Hedges line metered 
sidewalks and the grass is always 
trimmed and green. Dogs are not al- 
lowed. 

I visit a young woman who lives 
there. She is a divorcee who has 



7 



one child, female, four years old, 
blonde, normal build, fifty-two 
pounds. The child stays with a sitter 
on Friday nights and I don’t see her 
until Saturday mornings. She hasn’t 
learned my name yet. Her mother is 
also blonde. She is always eager to 
see me and appreciates my scientific 
pursuits. She is a microbiologist and 
works cataloguing viruses in the 
laboratories administered by the 
famous Raoul Fuchs, a pioneer in 
microbiology. The lab is funded si- 
multaneously by the University and 
by several private medical founda- 
tions. The staff there is very well 
paid and cared for. My weekend 
lover works closely with Fuchs, al- 
though I don’t think he speaks to 
her very often. 

I arrive at seven-thirty every Fri- 
day night. She gives me Scotch to 
drink and I relax from the treacher- 
ous drive down the mountain and 
from the tensions caused by an- 
ticipating the blinding lights. She 
always has her apartment lights 
turned low because of my profes- 
sional concern for the quality of my 
night vision. She is a very soft 
woman with clear, fair skin. Her 
name is Claudine but I call her 
Clo . .its an affectionate pet name 
that I learned in France when I was 
there on a research exchange. A 
professor I knew had a wife named 
Claudine and he often called her 
Clo. 

Clo is usually passionate and 
playful. She freely directs my pre- 
liminary caresses. Her bedroom is 



small and white with blue curtains 
slightly faded by sunlight. There is 
no brick-a-brack. She has displayed 
five original Jasper Johns prints 
along one wall. She purchased them 
some years prior as an investment. 
On the opposite wall there is a long 
dressing mirror and a walnut hutch 
which she uses as a dresser. Her 
voice is melodious. Often tears 
come to her eyes, perhaps with an- 
ticipation. She is curious and 
breathless, drinking that which 1 
save for her each week. 

At a quarter to nine, we leave the 
apartment building and walk to the 
campus cinema series held in 
Specker Hall. We walk along the 
streets that are crowded with noisy 
vehicles and choked with old tab- 
loids and shopper’s throw-aways. 
The mercury vapor lights don’t gen- 
erally affect my eyes, but I wear 
my Gemini glasses just in case. She 
wears a leather coat with a mink 
collar, a gift from her former hus- 
band who was an actuary. Their di- 
vorce had something to do with her 
flute playing. 

On this particular night I began to 
notice certain subtle fluctuations in 
the predicted pattern of events. 
There had been no sudden encoun- 
ters with mad truck lights in my 
usually perilous descent from my 
mountain sanctuary. Rather, it was 
a smooth, restful ride and 1 noticed 
the orange streaks in the western 
sky. The valley roads were not 
crowded with the usual vehicle traf- 
fic. People were not swarming

around the drive-in fast food dis- 
pensaries, nor were any of their sal- 
low children to be seen clamoring 
near the garbage receptacles. I did 
not see a single Highway Patrol car. 
And since it was very easy to find a 
parking space near the brick apart- 
ment buildings where she lived I ar- 
rived somewhat ahead of schedule. 

The babysitter was taking the 
child away as I entered the bright 
yellow hallway with its series of 
brown doors and brass fixtures. I do 
not like the green carpet. The 
babysitter was overweight, as I had 
once imagined, and smiled at me 
without looking at me directly. The 
child was playing with a stuffed cot- 
ton owl. The babysitter giggled as 
she took the happy child upstairs to 
another apartment. 

Clo was waiting, flushed and ex- 
cited. I could see that she was very 
happy and had been drinking. The 
lights were all on bright, but that 
didn’t really matter because I had 
kept my Gemini glasses on, 
whereas I usually put them into 
their titanium case and placed that in 
my inner breast pocket. I closed the 
apartment door. She said, “They 
were celebrating at the laboratory. 
Ransward has been promoted. Even 
so, his wife is no longer ill and then 
there is the news from the 
greenhouse. They have completed 
the new wing.” 

“Was it a grand opening?” I 
asked in reply. The Venetian blinds 
were drawn up, the cords hanging 
loosely to the floor.

DON’T MISS IT! 

Clo became very suggestive of 
sudden passion and stripped off her 
cashmere sweater and bra right in 
front of me. Her nipples were ex- 
tended. I still had my raincoat on. 
There was a glass on the cherry cof- 
fee table and I assumed that it held 
scotch. She lay back on the couch, 
her arms stretched over her head. 
The uncovered window seemed to 
intrigue her. “What if someone 
looks in?” she said, laughing at the 
thought she had expressed. The 
possibility seemed to heighten her 
playful sex game. She asked me to 
drink some of the scotch. It was 
from a John Begg bottle I had 
bought three weeks prior. I didn’t 
even think of her small white bed- 
room. She was very daring to have 
pulled the Venetian blinds up ... it 
seemed to be something planned. I 
wondered about it, but said nothing 
and kept most of my clothes on just 
for diversion.

We were late starting out for the 
cinema. She held my arm and dis- 
coursed on the peculiar nature of 
the quaint, humorous viruses which 
she was currently observing. 

I noticed that the gutters and 
streets were clean and I only saw 
one throw-away shopper’s guide. 
Briefly, from the comer of my eye, 
I saw “NOW” and “59(S” in red 
letters. Light rain began to fall as 
we climbed the wide cement stair- 
way that lead to the Specker Sci- 
ence Hall where the medium capac- 
ity auditorium was reserved each 
Friday for members of the Cinema 
Series. I have been in regular atten- 
dance for twenty-three months. The 
series is particularly frequented by 
scientific professionals and lately 
the incidence of political types and 
radical artisans has been waning, a 
cycle I have noticed to have a 
peak/slough frequency of four 
months. We took our seats quickly. 
I couldn’t recall being late before. 
The evening program had just be- 
gun. I had seen one of the films be- 
fore. It was directed by Robert 
Flaherty and the grainy quality of 
the print was somehow relaxing. 

There was no reason to think 
about the dead peonies; nothing in 
the film program suggested them. I 
didn’t notice any cigar smoke and 
kept my right hand close to the 
mink on Clo’s leather coat collar. 
Twice during the program, which 
was somehow quite brief, she whis- 
pered to me about ink on her hands. 
“I had to wash them three times 



and then it was difficult under my 
fingernails,” she said at first; and 
then later, toward the end of the 
second film, which was an obscure 
Latin American political drama, she 
whispered ”... you would think 
they would get some special 
cleanser. It’s hardly visible now but 
some is still there on my thumb.” 

There was a medium rain falling 
as we left the cinema. The air had 
an acid taste to it and I found it un- 
comfortable to breathe deeply. She 
didn’t want to go to the Pizza 
Palace, but I insisted in a quiet 
manner. It was a necessary part of 
the evening and a contrast to the 
studied decorum of the Cinema 
Series. Many of the same people 
from the cinema went to the Pizza 
Palace afterward. I was happy that 
she soon forgot her reasons for not 
wanting to go. 

We drove on near empty streets 
with colors from the storefronts 
and from the street lights running 
together in the reflections of the 
rain-wet street. We didn’t play the 
radio. She always considers this 
drive to the Pizza Palace to be pre- 
carious and she doesn’t like the old 
streetcar tracks, especially if they 
glisten in the rain. It’s very difficult 
to avoid them, but I manage it very 
well. She says they frightened her 
as a child, that she saw them as 
dangerous metal snakes. She tends 
to stare at them in fascination when 
they are wet and threading away 
into the light. She knows full well 
that they only lead to the deserted 



10 



GALAXY 



car barn. Somehow the imagery ter- 
rorizes her. 

On this night, there was a large 
crowd at the Palace, as I had ex- 
pected, due to the modest rain. The 
incidence of crowds is somehow 
variable with the density of the 
rain . light or heavy rain will 
produce only a moderate crowd, 
thinning to only a small gathering 
with the heaviest downpours. Mod- 
erate rains produce the heaviest 
crowds, so it’s easy to see the ex- 
pectancy. It was difficult for us to 
get our usual table and we both 
noticed the gaping mouths of the 
pizza eaters assembled. She gave 
her secret laugh. Eventually we had 
to share a table with several others, 
something that I readily enjoyed, 
but sensed that she didn’t. 

Two frowns from the history de- 
partment sat quite close to us and 
perhaps for our benefit engaged us 
in a lively discussion on the 
philosophy of science. Inevitably 
the discussion led to the prolifera- 
tion of nuclear arms and the moral 
question facing those scientists in- 
volved in planning the develop- 
ments in nuclear engineering. I 
thought that I was correct in stating 
the inherent differences between 
pure and applied sciences as well as 
the difference between research and 
engineering. 

Actually, I wasn’t -^uite prepared 
to accept the discussion, involved as 
I am with the vast reaches of deep 
outer space where man and his toys, 
now so lethal and extortive, are 



quite obviously not permitted. I told 
them about the state of flux in 
catalogued RR Lyrae stars and that 
-our own Sol might be just such a 
star and that our state of society 
could disappear, almost if not in 
fact overnight. One solar flare of 
major intensity and life here on 
Earth could be reduced to bacteria. 
They weren’t prepared for such a 
casual statement of cosmic practical- 
ity, nor for the immensity of gas 
volume ejected from variable stars 
in the form of intermittent solar 
flares. 

I began to notice a fluctuation in 
the pulse of conversation and was 
sorry to have left my Omega wrist 
chronometer in the car. I became 
aware of a certain tall girl sitting 
close to the window. 

I felt a sudden tension creep 
across my forehead as if I were in- 
volved in heavy concentration. The 
history buffs were deep into the lat- 
est account of nuclear reactor acci- 
dents and were parying the reality 
of the India tests with new reactor 
plans speculated on by the Egyptian 
forces amid the Arab community. A 
chill spread evenly across the floor. 
I could see it flow as well as feel it 
tuck about my ankles. I looked 
across the table expecting to gaze 
into the eyes of my lover, she who 
is my friend and who helps me dis- 
sipate the cloudy tensions that 
gather from the mental intensity my 
work requires. 

A cold phase of inactivity had 
gripped her. It was clearly someone 



VARIATIONS IN THE VISIBLE- SPECTRA 



11 



else looking out from her eyes. A 
change spread over her face, subtle 
and unnoticed by anyone else. I 
stared at her, transfixed. It appeared 
that a hairless, brown-toothed old 
man was peering at me, or through 
me. There was a laugh of recogni- 
tion. I shuddered. It was clear that 
this subtle figure was aware of all 
our intimacies. 

Behind him, I had the image of 
an amphitheatre somewhat like those 
used for surgical instruction. It was 
occupied by a chorus of washerwo- 
men who sneered at the sensual 
content of my mind. As suddenly as 
they all had appeared, these imagis- 
tic wraiths, there was a sudden in- 
crease in the level of the rainstorm. 

Again I noticed the tall girl sit- 
ting alone at the window. Her hair 
was a soft reddish brown. A mes- 
sage came to me from her mind. I 
knew she was trying to contact me. 
I had known it for three weeks. 
Now it was clear. I knew that I 
would see her the next day at the 
data processing center. She worked 
there for a Laser Spectrographic 
Statistic group. I recalled seeing her 
before. 

With the sudden increase in rain, 
the searching ghost of an old man 
left the face of my companion. She 
seemed unaware of any outside 
event. She noticed that my hand 
was shaking, so I quickly brought 
my mind to the reference file of 
main sequence stars. This is a great 
stabilizer for me in times of unclar- 
ity or stress. The hideous washer- 



women and their spectral inter- 
locutor dissolved completely as the 
waitress came over to our table to 
announce that the Palace was out of 
mushrooms. I suddenly said, “Cas- 
siopeia,” outloud! No one seemed 
to hear me. 

I had a sudden impulse to return 
to the Observatory that very night. 
The pizza arrived just at the critical 
moment in the decision process, and 
I was persuaded by its aroma to 
postpone any sudden departure from 
the median flow and to ride out the 
night’s impending storm. Even 
without the mushrooms, the pizza 
centered my consciousness enabling 
me to overcome any desire to flee 
back to the safety and comfort of 
my familiar rooms on the mountain. 
The rain continued and even in- 
creased in falling density. There 
was no wind, only heavy rain. As 
we consumed the pizza its steamy 
air-pocketed crust supported the 
bubbling cheese layer and emitted 
the pungent scent of oregano. I 
again felt that the tall girl from the 
Laser Spectro group was signalling 
me. 

It was her aura that reminded 
me of Cassiopeia. I strained to 
imagine her motives, to grasp the 
import of her need to contact me so 
covertly. She seemed intent upon 
the patterns of sound generated by 
the rise and lad of the frequency of 
the rain. 

Mentally, I notated the rain pat- 
terns in a binary sequence. I would 
be able to run them into our com- 



12 



GALAXY 










puter module the very next morn- 
ing. 

The rain began fading to moder- 
ate. The Cassiopeian left the Palace 
suddenly, just as a squad of happy 
undergraduates poured in the front 
door. As I had once observed, the 
fluctuations in the density of rain 
was proportional to the density of 
the crowd. More people poured in 
the door as Clo and I prepared to 
leave. We helped each other with 
our coats and slipped out into the 
rain. I was chewing the last of our 
pizza crust, and Clo was reciting 
stanzas from Poe. 

My eyes had suffered somewhat 
from the flare of the neon beer sign 
that hung on the wall of the pizza 
place. It had been directly to my 
left, affecting my peripheral vision 
to that side. Because of that, Clo 
drove us home to her apartment. 
She didn’t mind driving, in fact 
seemed to enjoy the wet streets and 
the slow-moving traffic. She under- 
stood that my mind was busy with 
the variable star project. I did not 
mention the vision that I had ob- 
served in the pizza shop. I knew 
that such a disclosure would only 
bring forth a welter of confusion 
and attempts to ease my state of 
mind. 

I was clear in the matter. I knew 
that the girl from laser data and the 
vision of the spectral searching man 
were real and related. I was unable 
to make any of the necessary synap- 
tic connections and was particularly 
uncertain as to the nature of the 



name “Cassiopeia” that had ap- 
peared in my mind. I labled the en- 
tire phenomenon “Cassiopeian In- 
trigue” and filed it all away for fur- 
ther investigation. I especially did 
not mention the part about the tall 
girl sending me messages. 

★ ★ ★ 

Much later, as I lay naked and 
erect upon Clo’s bed, unresisting to 
the explorations of her fingers and 
of her lips, I repeated the binary 
sequence that I had notated in the 
drumming of the rain against the 
window where the tall girl had been 
seated. 

The sequences were clear in my 
mind. I was speculating on the 
probability that this Miss Cassiopeia 
was manipulating the frequency in 
the manner of a code. Clo enjoys 
our late night sex play, especially, 
it seems, when I am into a state of 
mental concentration that rather de- 
taches me from my body. She finds 
that I am then passive and unresist- 
ing and she can have my body 
completely under her will and de- 
sire. This seems to occur in the 
middle week of every second month 
usually just before one of my major 
bouts with the data processing 
machines. Clo is far more tactile 
than I am. It pleases me also to be 
able to surrender my body to her. 

That night as I lay awash in the 
rhythms of her touches, I again felt 
the rhythms of the rain and just for 
one instant imagined that Clo and 



14 



GALAXY 



Miss Cassiopeia were one and the 
same. I fell asleep envisioning the 
morrow’s encounter. 

My time schedule for the data 
terminal was 9:22 until, 10:44 in the 
morning session and 4:42 until 5:52 
in the afternoon. I always process 
for an hour or more. I am very for- 
tunate in having this much time 
available to me for my own project. 
Corweiller is responsible for that 
and I am very grateful for it. 

I have a close friend in cloud 
physics at the RAND Corporation 
and he can’t get anywhere near that 
much time even for his confidential 
projects. I once offered to surrender 
some of my time on our access to 
the 4000004. He did not take the 
offer kindly. He failed to see the 
humor in my situation. He certainly 
considered that the offer might have 
been a security test. 

I was prepared to arrive at the 
data center at 9:00. That would 
leave two minutes to enter the 
building, five minutes to make my 
way to the Astral Research Data 
terminal room and fifteen clear 
minutes to organize my thoughts 
and direct them into the flow of my 
project. Computer programs were 
my specialty in high school. I se- 
cured my university scholarships 
through a mastery of the mathemat- 
ics involved. I feel very secure in 
front of a computer console and my 
capabilities are well recorded. 

That morning I allowed for de- 
lays and mishaps as I usually do by 
getting up at 6:35 and getting an

early start. I have never yet missed 
schedule on data time. I am always 
ready to activate my console and 
plug into the electron flow on time 
and without delay. After breakfast, 
which I always prepare as this is 
one of my personal joys, Clo went 
up to the sitter’s apartment to bring 
her child back home. 

It was during those moments 
while I was eating the last of the 
commeal muffins that I began to re- 
alize that it would not be an ordi- 
nary day. I suddenly suspected that 
the binary notations that I had made 
the previous night from the rain- 
drops would probably phase into 
some kind of language and thereby 
a direct message would transmit. I 
could see that I would probably not 
be working on my own ideas or 
with my own information. Ordinar- 
ily this would have distressed me 
but I was intrigued by the Cas- 
siopeians and I didn’t care if I 
missed the entire day. I sensed that 
something of more immediate im- 
portance was going on and I vowed 
to keep my mind open as I prepared 
my morning program. 

According to schedule, I arrived 
at the data center just at 9:00 a.m. 
Clo had driven me there in my 
BMW since her own car was due 
for lube and oil. Her daughter ac- 
companied us and as I got out of 
the car, the child said to me, 
“Hurry, hurry, Cassiopeia is calling 
you.” I was thunderstruck at first, 
and a chill started to gather about 
my ankles again. Clo said nothing

unusual, however, and the bright 
sun of the' morning glittered in the 
windshield. They drove off without 
any further inferences. 

I went into the building without 
any more hesitation. The morning 
sun and dewy fragrance in the air 
was replaced by the even, flat 
fluorescence of the entry corridor. 
The Observatory offices and data 
consoles are on the top floor. We 
have a splendid view of the local 
rooftops and the towering old trees 
and bushes. There are more than 
350 rare varieties of trees in the 
neighborhood and with the high 
rolling hills and the porticos of the 
more residential areas, the entire 
scene is quite pastoral, especially on 
Saturday mornings. I took the red 
elevator to our floor and checked 
into the console room immediately. 
According to schedule, I plugged 
into the 4000004. 

★ ★ ★ 

Unprecedented input barraged 
me. I began to receive voluminous 
static and superfluous data. I acti- 
vated several damping frequencies 
to filter out the unessential noise 
and return the console to my control 
^d activity. I began to concentrate 
on pertinent details and to slowly 
organize a residual fund of sunspot 
data in preparation for a cross re- 
feral with the suspected emission 
data from Cygnus RR7240. 

Right away I received a direct 
order from the 4000004. I was 

16 



stunned. I had both heard and imag- 
ined that console technicians, true 
artists in the science of computer 
programming and engineering, 
could with fortune and polarity con- 
tact the heart of the machine. 

The 4000004 itself began direct- 
ing the course of events. My sun- 
spot cross referal was shuttled into 
an idle memory rewind and my 
console was cleared. The video 
screen printed out my name. I was 
directed to pay attention to the 
screen. I was next directed to punch 
out a simple pattern on a standard 
input card and did so at the cutter, 
which is just like a typewriter cut- 
ting stencils. The keyboard is dif- 
ferent with more symbols and the 
only thing it does is cut holes in 
plastic cards. I looked at the pattern 
I had cut and couldn’t place it arij^ 
where in my mind. I memorized it 
as a matter of professional curiosity 
and determined to reproduce it 
sometime in the future. 

The video screen next ordered me 
to fit the card into the receiver. I 
balked. I punched in a mathematical 
question which was not in itself 
material but one by which the 
4000004 would know that I wasn’t 
just taking orders from a machine. 
The video screen immediately told 
me that my sunspot data would be 
cancelled unless I complied. I was 
not at all used to coercion and my 
hands began to shake. I had devoted 
twelve years to compiling that data. 
I followed the order. 

There were two other consoles in 

GALAXY 



the Astral Research Data room. Both 
of them activated the moment that I 
put the new program into the re- 
ceiver. I was startled and a bit 
frightened. I didn’t have authoriza- 
' tion to activate the other consoles. 

I It was not considered ethical to 
tamper with someone else’s console 
without prior acknowledgement. 
Years of work could be erased in 
milliseconds. 

The 4000004 next ordered me to 
j be calm and not be concerned for 
i the opening of the other two con- 
soles. The data they controlled was 
being stored in similar manner to 
my own simple collations of 
sunspots. I sat in front of the center 
console, closing my eyes as the ex- 
traordinary input increased. I began 
I to visualize and to hear the work- 
ings of the data flow contained in 
the machine. The 4000004 is really 
a very big computer and until then I 
had no actual idea of just how much 
information and how many addi- 
tional probabilities were available. I 
began to see within my mind and 
fixed on a crystalline structure vib- 
rating sonorously at 3600 cycles per 
second. 

I hadn’t seen the tall girl that 
morning. I had often seen her be- 
fore on these Saturday mornings 
either in the corridor or behind the 
glass windows of the Optical Laser 
Group study library. A second 
image appeared in the middle of the 
crystal structure. It turned and 
glowed softly like a hologram. The 
next order I perceived inside my 



head. It was Miss Cassiopeia. She 
was seated at a bench in the Laser 
Spectro Laboratory. I looked at her 
clearly. She said, “I need your 
help. Pay attention to the 4000004. 
I need your assistance.” 

'Die image faded and next I saw 
Clo sitting in the park nearby, not 
far from the tennis courts. Her child 
was picking miner’s lettuce that was 
growing in a ragged row under a 
clump of older eucalyptus trees. I 
could see Clo’s old black Porsche 
speedster sitting at the curb with the 
top down. Clo looked at me out of 
the depths of the glowing crystal. 

She said, ‘‘You have been 
selected to assist Miss Cassiopeia 
because of your expertise in manip- 
ulating the energy flow of 
4000004. The machine likes you. I 
am going to help you. Perhaps you 
think that I am not enough aware of 
the intricacies of this machine, but 
that is of no importance. You may 
feel free to draw upon my mental 
energies as Miss Cassiopeia di- 
rects.” 

There was no time to respond to 
Clo’s announcement. A polarity 
surge swept me into activity. The 
4000004 began to give me pro- 
gramming information and was re- 
questing routes for a fifty micron 
laser flow. I opened six optical cir- 
cuits for a review and let the 
machine pick the fastest one. The 
video monitor gave me the mes- 
sage, ‘‘Fastest is not always best,” 
and then, ‘‘Prepare six additional 
routes that are less direct.” 



VARIATIONS IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRA 



17 



I wondered why the 4000004 
couldn’t do the projections itself 
and then I realized that the machine 
was not entirely in control of things 
and that if it needed me to program, 
I had a definite lever to use in re- 
gaining my illusions of indepen- 
dence. I opened six more opticals 
and sent them on longer routes that 
combined a series of thin-film prisms 
which were sitting unused at the en- 
trance to the spectrum analyzer of 
our own Space Simulation Lab. 

The machine next directed me to 
put on a fine-wire headset that was 
resting on top of the video monitor. 
It fit lightly over the temples and 
around the medula oblongata. It ap- 
peared to be made of molybdenum 
and had two crystals of unknown 
composition situated on either side. 
The headset was not part of the 
4000004’ s standard equipment. I 
didn’t have time to ask where it 
came from. As soon as I fit the de- 
vice over my temples, I heard a 
quick pleasant note somewhat like 
the ring heard upon striking a piece 
of fine cut glass. The ringing tone 
was followed by a rush of electronic 
bell tones similar to those heard in 
long distance couplings of the tele- 
phone system. 

■k -k it 

I realized at once that my mind 
had been propelled out of my body 
and that I was, in all certain effects, 
a conscious part of the 4000004 it- 
self. A wave of fear swept me 



through a series of terminal blocks 
and through the high threshold extra 
noise barriers. I became aware of 
all memory cores stored within the 
data retrieval systems. I knew the 
essence of the various circuitries, 
electrical as well as optical. I came 
to rest in a cool yellow place that 
seemed to harmonize with my own 
frequency of excitation. Miss Cass 
was already there waiting for me. 
She anticipated my questions about 
the headset and about a lot of other 
recent phenomena which were be- 
yond the schedule of regular events. 

I heard her voice drifting to me 
from the very substrate structure of 
the optical couplings. “The headset 
was made according to my design 
by technicians in my employ. The 
4000004 is currently under my di- 
rection. I planned it that way for 
this time period. We are in a for- 
tress. It is a fortress of my mind 
composed to protect me from an as- 
sault that is due momentarily. 

“We are currently the only minds 
within the machine and the only 
operators working at the consoles. 
Your body is functioning quite cor- 
rectly and continues to follow direc- 
tives impulsed through the electron 
flow. It is at this moment construct- 
ing a pattern of decoys, dodges and 
traps for my assailants. The body 
that you identify as “me” is in the 
Laser Spectro Lab, building an ob- 
stacle course for amplified light. 
Your function will involve coor- 
dinating a variety of microwave and 
electron circuits. Pay attention and 



Jo what is required and you shall be 
‘ well rewarded.” 

I was concerned to hear of my 
body spoken of as “it” but I ad- 
' justed quickly to being both me and 
not-iue. I was primarily determined 
not to lose twelve years of astral re- 
I search to the inner workings of the 
4000004 and its new controller. The 
body that had housed me was not- 
me. It was working smoothly under 
the direction and supervision of the 
4000004. Miss Cass generated an 
image of the Astral Data console 
room and I saw myself seated com- 
; fortably at the digital printer, 
i Biological functions were monitored 
and displayed on the oscilloscope 
network in the medical research 
monitors of the astronaut program 
located on the third floor. I regained 
^ a measure of security in knowing 
I that my body was being cared for 
! by the very machine that was using 
' '*• 

I caught the image of Miss Cass’ 
j long, slender earthbody tinkering 
I with a variety of laser gear, princi- 
: pally a niodimium single pulse 
' generator of great length. She was a 
! very beautiful figure, tall and slim, 
j Her fingers were quite long and 
' very busy with inter-connectors. I 
! couldn’t decide what she was doing 
I and looked for the answer within 
the 4000004 itself. I had to do so in- 
between micro-bits because I was 
i being called upon every few sec- 
: onds to make numerous changes in 
1 pre-scheduled programs. It seemed 
; to me that some sort of evasive con- 



test was being waged somewhere in 
the tiny world of electronic impulse 
modulators. 

I was able to detach a reasonable 
portion of my creative mind from 
the rather rote re-programming that 
was being called for from the cen- 
tral data banks. With this essential 
explorative problem-solving entity 
within my mind-body, I was able to 
tour about inside the circuitry. 

The first noticeable situation that 
I encountered was the full “on” 
status of the Visual Simulation 
Laboratory on the same floor as our 
own console room. The entire staff 
of the Visual Experiments group 
was away on a picnic.. Yet, the 
monitors and video screens amid 
their collection of advanced equip- 
ment were all in operation. The 
complete arrangement of optical cir- 
cuits, those operated by laser light 
instead of the more conventional 
electrical current, were in play and 
the latest speculations in thin con- 
nectors were manifested in a variety 
of wave-guide modes. Light waves 
emanating from the thin-film lasers 
formed a maze of probabilities that 
1 dared not explore too deeply at 
that instant for fear of getting lost 
within the blur of vari-colored 
lights. 

As I navigated through the mem- 
ory core terminals. Miss Cass’ 
voice caught up to me. “Behind 
alpha-Cassiopeia is a binary star,” 
she said. “It can’t be seen from 
Earth because alpha-Cassiopeia is 
the sight line. The way your planet

is moving, the binary system that 
was once my home won’t come into 
view for another 324,000 years. 
The binary system is blue and 
white ... a small, tiny, lovely 
white star, a diamond so beautiful. 
And then there is the blue giant. 
The giant star has fifty-five inhabit- 
ed planets revolving in its bio- 
sphere. The white star has only 
three. 

“The Overseers of the blue spec- 
trum star captured the white system 
about three million Earth years ago. 
My whole family of Advanced 
Light Cult Technicians was put to 
work for the Overseers. About two 
hundred years ago, two of my sis- 
ters and I escaped via our mastery 
of hyper-light devices and applica- 
tion theories. I have been hiding 
here on Earth since 1904 and have 
passed my consciousness into three 
living bodies including the one now 
working in the Laser Spectro Lab. 
This latest one I conceived with a 
Swedish Olympic star back in 1954 
She is now twenty -three. The host 
body, the mother body, dies soon 
after delivery and the mind-body 
migrates to the new baby. You will 
be getting into that here on Earth in 
another million years or so. 

“One of my sisters lives now on 
Banisterias, a single uninhabited 
planet that revolves around Proxima 
Centauri. The other one wanders 
through the uninhabited spheres that 
sprinkle the millions of stars in the 
Clouds of Magellan. Eventually, we 
plan to establish a colony of our 



friends there to carry on the pre. 
cepts of our Cult of Light and exist 
there in freedom without coercion 
from any Overs'eers. We will be ef- 
fectively out of the galaxy.” 

It was hard for me to comprehend 
what she was talking about. 1 
couldn’t imagine who these Over- 
seers were and why she was hiding 
from them. I was fascinated by the 
inner workings of the 4000004 and 
was determined to discover how this 
Miss Cass had contrived to com- 
mandeer such an elaborate machine 
and, more importantly for my own 
welfare, how she managed to propel 
my mind into the inner workings of 
the circuitry. I dispensed with any 
mathematical communications and; 
asked her directly why she wasl 
afraid. 

“Unfortunately,” she replied 
shortly, “the Overseers from 
Casularix, that’s the blue star 
people, have issued an arrest war- 
rant for me and my two sisters. 
That has made us fair game on any 
of the planets that Casularix corre- 
sponds with, including all of 
alpha-Cassiopeia. The Overseers 
hold patents for some of the hyper- 
light devices that we designed for 
them in order to pay off our father’s 
mortgage, see? By claiming that we 
are potentially subversive knowl- 
edge holders, they have somewhat 
quarantined us to underdeveloped 
planets like Earth or totally non- 
civilized places like Banasterias. 

“Fortunately for us there are a 
hundred Earth places within easy 



20 



GALAXY 



reach of the average light traveller 
and it is hard for them to track us 
down. They want us in jail some- 
where so we can’t break their con- 
trol of the light device market. Ac- 
tually we have no such plans. But 
they are much too mercantile to be- 
lieve it.” 

I was preparing to ask a dozen 
simple questions when a lower de- 
cibel audio wave brought the de- 
fense system to alert status. 

The first attack began as an infu- 
sion of sound vibrations that im- 
mediately threatened to overwhelm 
the laser currents I had constructed 
as perimeter defense. Sound waves 
can create interference patterns in a 
laser beam as it travels through cer- 
tain transparent solids. The interfer- 
ence patterns were beginning to dis- 
rupt the sequence of our color codes 
and, at instants, breaking the cohe- 
sion of some micro-watt beams. 
Miss Cass remained calm and 
unmoved within her orb of con- 
centration. The 4000004 was com- 
pletely in her control. 

As the sound-wave invasion 
began probing into the secondary 
data receivers, she directed a 
magnetic microwave advance to ab- 
sorb it. She was taking the sound 
probe into the peripheral data cir- 
cuits and rev-recording them . 
“If these sounds could be packaged 
here on Earth and put out to the 
public on cassettes, you would 
probably have a market potential 
of 26,506,740! Seventeen percent 
would be certain to purchase.” 

VARIATIONS IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRA 



Her message was printed out 
across the security data third floor 
system analyzer which was housed 
right next to the astronaut premedi- 
cal evaluation study. “Quite a nifty 
profit would be gained and you 
wouldn’t have to arrange accounts 
for the musicians.” 

“Who is it?” I questioned her. 
“Who is attacking you and why?” I 
wasn’t at all sure that Miss Cass 
should be so protected. She had def- 
initely conscripted me. I was her 
lieutenant, her general and her pri- 
vate all at the same time. I wasn’t 
at all sure of her, but managed to 
balance my uncertainty with the un- 
precedented opportunity to explore 
the inner workings of the 4000004. 
For the moment I was quite capable 
of manning her battle stations and 
countering the somewhat clumsy 
and rather scattered attack that was 
in progress. 

The sound attack was being 
drawn off and absorbed on the 
magnetic recorders. As each tape 
was filled, not-me seated in the As- 
tral Data room drew the contents 
through the satellite communications 
group translator, amplified the im- 
pulses into microwaves and trans- 
mitted them back into space via 
Galaxy Communications Research 
Facility located in the high desert, 
three hundred miles away. I knew 
these sudden and unauthorized 
transmissions would cause interrup- 
tions and theoretical arguments at 
the GCRF that would never be ex- 
plain'ed. I tried to disguise the fre- 



21 



quency barriers to resemble cosmic 
ray-hadron interactions, but was cer- 
tain that the shallow curve graph de- 
tails would be detected. Miss Cass 
did not seem to care or even to 
notice that we had pirated several 
classified strategic transmission cy- 
cles. I balked at her cold hearted 
disruption of a multi-million dollar 
communications base. Some of the 
finest minds of the century worked 
at GCRF and I had often been out 
there myself in a consultant’s capac- 
ity. 

“People can lose their jobs over 
this,’’ I complained. “This is 
completely unauthorized!’’ 

Miss Cass’ reply was accom- 
panied by low hissing static. “Un- 
authorized? I am the authority 
within the 4000004. These 
technologies are here and now 
under my direction.’’ 

I hated dictatorships, but I held a 
reserve of admiration for her con- 
centration of energies. This un- 
knowable person was commanding 
an interrelated system of potentials 
that had taken the combined evolu- 
tion of Earth civilization five 
thousand .years to build. And she 
was using it for a shield. Her voice 
filtered out of the hissing static and 
fluttered amid the lower decibels. 
“I have made these separate 
technologies work together for the 
first time, perhaps the only time in 
their brief histories . the 
4000004, the GCRF, the Laser 
Spectro Group, the Visual Simula- 
tions Lab, Astrological Data, even a 



feedpulse generator from the Linear 
Accelerator.’’ 

Her voice flowed away like 
springwater tumbling over rocks. I j 
had the sudden feeling that perhaps i 
this was the only true reason for the 
existence of Earth’s massive elec- 
tronics industry ... to protect Miss 
Cass from her pursuers. All the 
other reasons, the research, the ad- 
vance of knowledge, the myriad ap- | 
plications of science and engineer- I 
ing, medicine and commerce were 
at that moment inferior and sec- 
ondary. 

The sound attack faded. It served j 
only to tense the system of defense. : 
I agreed with the principle of ab- I 
sorbing the varied sound energies, [ 
mixing them into softer and more 
manageable frequencies and then 
amplifying them into microwaves j 
for transmission back into space. | 
Miss Cass’ ability to turn barrages of 
noise into music intoxicated me. 

The amplified 4000004 hummed 
and whined at triple speed. I hadn’t 
known such complete circuit inte- 
grations were possible. I began to | 
relax a bit and to enjoy the sensa- 1 
tion of being completely in tune 1 
with one of the most diversified | 
computer systems on the planet. I j 
thought that the attack had been t 
rather weak. I couldn’t see the • 
reasons compelling such an elabo- 
rate defense capability as Miss Cass 
had constructed. She was, after all, 
occupying multimillions of dollars j 
worth of advanced electronics. I j 
began to poke around in the mem- 



22 



GALAXY 



ory rewinds looking for my side- 
tracked sunspot data. I didn’t form 
a complete mental image of my in- 
tention: I didn’t want the 4000004 
to get anxious about my surveys. 

Miss Cass seemed quiet and very 
distant. She was setting up a maze 
of photon circuits within the 
Laser Spectro Lab’s experimental 
energy translators. I could see her 
Earthbody on a video monitor in the 
Biodata Observation Unit. She was 
still busy interconnecting a series of 
flash pumps about a niodimium las- 
jng rod. 

Miss Cass had contrived to 
schedule the most advanced collec- 
tion of modern technicians away 
from their hardware, away from 
their theoretical homebase. Every 
other computer person in the 
4000004 Program was away on va- 
cation or a picnic or accumulated 
sick leave. It was a schedule she 
had processed over a time period of 
eleven months. That was quite un- 
derstandable because everyone on 
the Program had his schedule ar- 
ranged to some degree by the 
4000004 itself. I had a momentary 
insight into her nuclear sense of 
timing just as I was relaxing into 
thoughts about our own rote accep- 
tance of any computer print-out or 
computer issued statement, bill, or 
time schedule. 

* ♦ * 

The second attack began soon 
after the sound probes had been ab- 

VARIATIONS IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRA 



sorbed, transmuted, and relayed 
back out into space. As I wasn’t 
expecting another challenge the alert 
signal startled me. The 4000004 
gave the new assault the code title 
of “Copy Two” and sent out an order 
for replacement parts. I began to 
see that the original 4000004 was 
limited to certain modes of thinking 
and reacting. I was amazed at its 
foresight in planning for future 
breakdowns. 

The electron flow that was being 
directed at us intensified and began 
to overflow the diversion circuits 
that I had prepared during my first 
few minutes of conscription. Excess 
energy was coming into the primary 
relays and racing toward the binary 
memory cores. The memory cores 
began to record this radiation as fast 
as it came in. Miss Cass quickly di- 
rected me to reverse the polarity on 
the magnetic fail-safe impulse 
shredder and hang on. 

I began to feel an applied extra 
gravity compressing me. The elec- 
tron flow assailing us was saturating 
my station. I couldn’t move my 
thought patterns very well and 
began to panic. The sense of being 
squeezed into microspace and iso- 
lated there was terrifying. A 
thousand negatives flashed into my 
consciousness. I was certain that 
Miss Cass had contrived to murder 
me in the pursuit of her self-pro- 
tective schemes to control the 
4000004 complex and its supportive 
systems. I had to struggle against a 
hundred forces that pressed upon me.

I was losing my identity and feared 
disintegration into the molecular 
status. 

I tried to recall the preliminary 
images that I had seen when I first 
plugged into the console earlier in 
the morning. I couldn’t determine 
how much time had elapsed since 
then; I couldn’t tell if it was five 
minutes or five hours. I recalled 
seeing Clo and her lovely daughter 
playing in the sunshine and I wres- 
tled against my attackers in order to 
draw close to Clo, her child, and 
the flowers. 

I remembered her last words to 
me. They seemed now like final in- 
structions, “. you may feel free 
to draw upon my mental energies.” 
I sought to do so and the picture 
that stayed in my mind process 
grew stronger and more clear. I 
could not, however, bring to mind 
any contact with Clo nor any further 
instmctions that would assist in the 
evasion or repulsion of my 
attackers. Clo’s image seemed to 
drift away beyond my reach. The 
face of her child became transparent 
like a leering jack-o’-lantem lit by 
candle. Each time Clo appeared to 
speak, her words were blurred out 
by the soft, floating tunes of an un- 
seen fluteplayer. 

An aurora of pink and yellow 
light eclipsed the sunny, flower- 
dotted knoll that Clo sat upon. The 
flute music faded and the entire pic- 
ture shriveled and blew away like 
mist. 

In a rage of fear and loss, I threw 



off the yoke of gravity that was 
condensing me and fled down a cor- 
ridor of ruby light. I was deep 
within the microcircuits of the opti- 
cal spectrum, pursued by an echo- 
ing roar of free electrons when I 
suddenly came upon the retrieval 
circuits in which the 4000004 had 
hidden my sunspot data. The reel 
was set to unwind through a 
magnetic eraser. I flashed a 
“close” signal to the eraser, sent ! 
the entire real of data to an unused 
residual collating bin and fused the , 
input-call switch which consisted of 
a magno iron-garnet film set on a 
circular substrate disk of iso- garnet. 
The data was safe from internal 
communication. There was no way < 
for the 4000004 to recall it and send j 
it to an eraser terminal. , 

I was free. 

I was not free from the pursuit of 
Miss Cass’ attackers. Naturally they 
sought to destroy my effectiveness 
as her ally. I began to visualize a 
swarm of electronic warrior emis- 
saries gathering about me again. I 
fled once more into the laser light 
corridors of the optical circuits. 
There was no time to assert my 
freedom from the 4000004’ s direc- 
tives. Quite the contrary, pursued as 
I was, I needed the machine’s assis- 
tance and protection. I requisitioned 
an impact by-line through the maser 
transducers and sought out a friend- 
ship maze in the pattern reproduc- 
tion unit. The 4000004 was not re- 
sponding adequately to my distress 
calls. 



I felt that I was drowning in elec- 
tricity, that I was a fish swimming 
through dry sand. I began to absorb 
the energy that surrounded me, 
seeking some medium to sustain my 
flight. I imagined that I was lost on 
the Moon trying to breathe pow- 
dered rocks in place of air. I ex- 
pected consciousness to wane, how- 
ever, the compression that threat- 
ened me lifted. The roaring express 
of electrons that pursued me fell 
far behind. I thought that I could 
hear gulls crying in a soft wind 
and seals barking in an unseen mist. 
Miss Cass appeared beside me in 
a yellow orb of sunlight. 

“Rest,” she said. “Your pur- 
suers are gone.” Her figure was en- 
tirely naked, her head adorned with 
a mane of soft hair in every hue. 
“Our maze of prism couplers has 
lost them in the substrates of the 
infra-red filters. All they can gener- 
ate now is excess heat and that will 
be radiated away by the 4000004’s 
internal thermostat.” I began to re- 
cover from my flight of panic and 
realized that I had served as a 
travelling decoy. The warrior em- 
issaries that I had perceived fol- 
lowing me through the laser cor- 
ridors had not found their way out. 
The 4000004 had diverted them into 
a heat trap. I took advantage of the 
momentary resting place to assert 
myself. 

“Look here,’’ I said boldly, 
“I’m through! My sunspot data is 
beyond your reach. The 4000004 is 
not all-powerful; it is simply a 



machine. It has limitations and it 
can’t reach my data and erase it, 
and furthermore, you can’t either. 
I’m getting out of this micro-war! I 
never volunteered and I don’t know 
why my discomfort and peril should 
be benefiting you. I have a good 
job at the Observatory and a lovely 
lady waiting for me ... in fact. 
I’m going to have her come and get 
me right now.” 

Miss Cass lowered her violet 
eyes. “Not anymore you don’t. 
Look.” 

Our minds convened before the 
video monitors in the Visual Simula- 
tion Lab. I couldn’t be sure that the 
scenes produced were in any way 
real. Miss Cass was capable of pro- 
ducing anything on those screens. I 
watched and saw Clo and her child 
get into a battered pickup truck. I 
think it was a 1952 Dodge. 

Miss Cass narrated the scenes 
that flickered on the tubes. “Your 
lady friend is leaving you. The man 
she is with now has been in and out 
of her life for three years.” I saw a 
slender, shabby figure of a man 
loading a few suitcases into the 
back of the pickup. “He is her 
music teacher, and the reason for 
her previous divorce. She is leaving 
you to live' with him and play the 
flute. She is taping a note to the 
steering wheel of your BMW. She 
hasn’t the courage to face you; after 
all you haven’t done anything 
wrong and, in fact, she considers you 
a perfect mate. The music teacher 
has some kind of spell over her.

They are going to live in a small 
shack near Sebastapol. Besides 
that, she has smashed in the right 
side of your automobile.” 

I couldn’t believe what I was see- 
ing. An emotional know was con- 
stricting my chest. It was hard to 
think straight. Clo and I had been 
together for seven months. True, we 
only saw each other on weekends 
but that was due to the nature of 
our professions. I knew that she 
hadn’t been seeing anyone else dur- 
ing that time and she knew that I 
hadn’t, either. It just wasn’t like her 
to run off to Sebastapol in an old 
rusty pickup. 

I decided that the video images 
were false and this Miss Cass was 
generating them to increase her 
leverage over me. With my sunspot 
data safe, she needed some addi- 
tional coercives to keep me in her 
schemes. I was in a good position 
to bargain. 

“The second attack is over,” 
Miss Cass said. “Our fortress has 
held. We haven’t been defeated 
. everything is safe. Almost ev- 
erything.” 

“What about Clo?” I asked. 
“Everything in your world is safe 
but what about mine? A good part 
of my life has just disintegrated and 
I have no immediate chance of put- 
ting it back together.” 

“You don’t believe it now, but 
you have gained. When this is all 
over and you return to your previ- 
ous schedule, you will notice that 
lots of things have changed some- 



what. I shall have to assume partial 
responsibility for the dissolution of 
your romance. I knew it was com- 
ing, you did not ... I could have 
prepared you.” 

“How did you know? Why have 
you conscripted me? You have 
separated us and arranged all 
this. ...” My mind settled into a 
hundred questions and I began to 
feel very tired and fuzzed out along 
the edges. Miss Cass’ voice soft- 
ened and her words condensed on 
the video screens, forming images 
of flying creatures. 

“I did not conscript you, the 
4000004 selected you because of 
your intuitive programming skills. I 
tried to communicate with you on 
other planes, especially last night 
with my raindrop game, but I was 
unsuccessful!.” 

I started to recall the binary se- 
quences that I had noted the night 
before, remembering the soft and 
hard patterns in the rain. I was 
somewhat caught between self- 
admiration for my position of 
pre-eminence with the 4000004 — 
after all there are over fifteen 
hundred skilled programmers 
scheduling in the current cycle — and 
my attempt to get free. 

★ ★ ★ 

Suddenly I was overwhelmed by 
a great pulse of light energy. A 
thousand red shapes swarmed past 
me, followed by a great glowing 
globe of multi-hued intensity. I 



26 



GALAXY 



couldn’t contain the volume of light 
that flashed by. Miss Cass retreated 
into the central cores of the optical 
circuitry. Her pursuers had generated 
a third attack. 

The image that I had confronted 
in the previous barrage tripled. Miss 
Cass was losing her cool yellow 
composure. She began to oscillate 
in the red spectrum. Her familiar 
human shape suddenly dispersed, 
becoming a spidery pattern of vio- 
let. The warrior emissaries from 
the star system Casularix renewed 
their attempts to take control of the 
4000004 and its variegated systems. 
I could actually see them this time. 
They had tall flickering ghost 
shapes but no specific mass or den- 
sity. Their forms pulsated in the red 
wavelengths, some of them stretch- 
ing into blue. 

Miss Cass was generating a ner- 
vous retreat. “They know I am here 
for sure. Calimat himself will join 
the attack. They think they have me 
in a comer!” I couldn’t comprehend 
the mechanism by which these 
emissaries intended to capture Miss 
Cass. No sooner had I formed the 
question than I received the answer 
via the 4000004’s intramural com- 
munications simulator: ”... there 
is no capture, my ally, there is only 
absorbtion. Calimat intends to con- 
sume my energy and take my 
light-knowledge for himself. With 
my quantity absorbed into his, he 
can master the hyper light 
techniques and gain control of the 
Casularix star system.” 



I was not a decoy this time. The 
waves of pursuing energy forms 
swept past me into the micro re- 
gions of the photon oscillators. I 
began to close down the entire sys- 
tem, circuit by circuit, coupler by 
coupler. I felt that Miss Cass had 
gone into total micro-space. Her 
pursuers, including the glowing 
obesity known as Calimat, chased 
after her. 

I saw my chance to escape from 
the conflicting barrages of electrons 
and began to race through the opti- 
cal mazes, closing them down be- 
hind me. I directed my material 
body, still seated dutifully at the 
Astral Data console, to prepare 
mathematical ionization modules 
similar to those observed beneath 
preliminary stellar atmospheric 
coronas and to jam the entire 
4000004 system with these primary 
electrical patterns. The opportunity 
to escape from the inner binary rela- 
tions cores arose when the entire 
impulse sequence diode unit fused 
and melted down. Three separate 
waves of amplified light shot out of 
the spectral pattern composite and I 
was propelled along with them like 
a raft on a flooding river. By quick 
chance, I managed to adhere to an 
island of tranquility at the entrance 
to an antique transistor relay that 
was part of a microwave generating 
station. 

The machine was shaking down 
and free electrons were hurtling ev- 
erywhere. Data impulses were un- 
winding from the memory cores at 



VARIATIONS IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRA 



27 



random intervals and there was no 
more internal cohesion to any direc- 
tives given. 

Slowly Miss Cass emerged from 
the fused infrastructures and shat- 
tered substrate material. She began 
to radiate her familiar aura of 
yellow-gold light. “They are 
gone.” Her voice sounded distant 
and weak. “My fortress has indeed 
held together. The emissaries sent 
to absorb me have themselves been 
absorbed. Calimat was fused in the 
burnout of the thin-film couplers. He 
is not an entity of this Universe any 
longer. He and his tribe of 
Technopriests will not gain control 
of the hyper light devices.” 

I was recovering my nuclear 
cohesion and lay back, luxuriating 
in a continuous emission of pleasant 
radiations. I couldn’t exactly say 
that I had been wounded in action, 
but there was a certain feeling of 
healing that flowed through me. 
Miss Cass did not seem to have 
been ruffled by the burnout or di- 
minished in any way. Her light had 
increased: her light-body had 
grown. 

“It’s a shame that I didn’t 
schedule our meeting sooner.” Miss 
Cass looked radiant. “I’m leaving 
Earth in a very few seconds. You 
won’t be able to follow me until 
you master the hyper-light traverse. 
It will take you the rest of your 
earthlife to do so. I am leaving this 
place because other emissaries will 
be on Calimat’ s trail before the end 
of the year. They will find a very 

28 



cold trail here. The events of the 
morning’s disaster will filter back to 
the Overseers on Casularix but they 
will most probably never discover 
the fusion cycle that burned out my 
pursuers. The 4000004 won’t even 
be the same machine by then ... it 
will have entirely new circuits, new 
housings, new devices. It might not 
even be in the same building. 
Earth has served me well. It will 
now become an effective dead end 
for any future pursuits.” 

I was amazed at her lack of con- 
cern for any of the damages done to 
the machine. “You just use any- 
thing you encounter to further your 
own plans. What about repairs? 
What about. ?” An image of 
Miss Cass began to take some shape 
out of the waning flashes of violet 
light. She wasn’t quite the same. 
Her soft yellow aura was infused 
with red. Her edges were muted and 
fuzzy. I couldn’t decide if I liked 
her more or liked her less. She 
seemed pudgy and slower. Her 
voice was tinny and I didn’t quite 
believe her anymore. 

“Even when you had a chance to 
escape my conscription, you applied 
yourself to my defense.” Miss Cass 
was pulsing with a slow, deliberate 
rhythm. “The next energy flood 
will propel me into another spec- 
trum. You are welcome to /ollow, 
astronomer. You have all the re- 
sources of Earth at your disposal. 
Discover the secrets of hyper-light 
and you can travel across the 
Galaxy and beyond. I am going 



GALAXY 



now to seek my sisters out in the 
unincorporated regions of the 
Clouds.” 

I wasn’t sure that joining Miss 
Cass was important to me. But the 
thought of travel throughout the 
realms of the nebulae was intoxicat- 
ing. My head was lost in a dozen 
instant fantasies of the clouds 

. myriads of star? swarming 
through shapeless regions of space 
without center. The prospected im- 
plications of my sunspot data and 
associated researches seemed distant 
and remedial. 

“Light,” said Miss Cass. Her 
aura fluctuated and diminished. “Ev- 
erything relies upon the light. Once 
you get it down about the light, you 
won’t have to grub for coal. Can 
you imagine getting to the Moon on 
coal? All that rocket propellant isn’t 
too many steps away from burning 
coal. You still burn something. 
Cave men burned logs, rocket men 
burn rocket fuel. You won’t get out 
to the Clouds in a rocket, rocket 
man.” 

1 had to admit that we still didn’t 
know how a photon was generated 
nor very much about how light 
waves propagate. But we did actu- 
ally get to the Moon on fossil fuel. 
And Mars would soon follow. Coal 
and oil and gas supplied the heat 
and light necessary for the planners 
and designers and dreamers to work 
by. The same electricity, generated 
by coal and oil had made it possible 
to release hydrogen and cool it 
down enough for containerization 



and thus use as a propellant. Coal 
and oil fired the furnaces that made 
steel possible, made titanium possi- 
ble. We did go to the Moon on fos- 
sils. 

1 was about to defend our state of 
technology when Miss Cass phased 
into the niodimium laser spectrum, 
flashed through a series of light 
amplifiers and disappeared. The 
4000004 shuddered and a thousand 
opticals fused. The electron cycle 
over-amped and the circuit breakers 
for thirty miles around blew out. 
The 4000004 was ruined. One 
hundred twenty-six million 
dollars melted down in a few milli- 
seconds. 

★ ♦ ★ 

I was propelled out of the electri- 
cal secondary circuits via an outlet 
for the 220 line over the workbench 
in the Astral Data console room. It 
was the only line that hadn’t fused 
in the big pulse that took Miss Cass 
away into a spectrum of light 
energy that 1 could only speculate 
about. A dozen questions of theoret- 
ical engineering formulated in my 
mind. I saw my other self seated 
calmly at the data console. I fixed 
my consciousness back down in my 
body and removed the headset that 
Miss Cass had fashioned and left 
behind. I wondered how many other 
pieces of hardware remained from 
her conscription of the system. My 
body was tense, and excess bio- 
electrical energy spasmed out of the 



VARIATIONS IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRA

left leg. I took a few deep breaths 
and opened my eyes. I could see 
molecular flashes in the dim blue 
light. I took another few breaths. 
The air had the heavy smell of 
ozone. 

I could hear a welter of confused 
voices oijtside the door and rose 
from the console chair, taking the 
steps to the door very slowly and with 
a slight sense of vertigo. I opened 
the gray metal door and stepped out 
into the corridor. Several people 
were running toward the Laser 
Spectro Lab. I knew exactly what 
they would find. 

A Junior fellow in the microbiol- 
ogy statistics group ran back down 
the corridor, passing me in full 
stride. “A young girl has been elec- 
trocuted in the laser lab! We’ve had 
a general blackout!” I couldn’t tell 
from his glassy eyes whether he 
was happy with morbid excitement 
or terrified at the sight of a dead 
body. 

And such a lovely body, too. The 
giant pulse that Cass had generated 
to propel her through the niodimium 
spectra and thence to her ultimate 
rendezvous with her sisters of light 
had left her soft husk partly charred. 
Her clothes were still smoking and 
the handspun Indian cotton blouse 
she had worn was sixty percent 
vaporized. My eyes fixed upon the 
long pink nipples of her breasts. 

I cursed myself for not decipher- 
ing the raindrop code and kicked 
myself for being so narrow, so sci- 
entific as to think that such a code 

30 



could only be related to the pursuits 
of knowledge! I was overcome by 
another flight of vertigo and had to 
sit down by the fire extinguisher in 
the corridor. Building maintenance 
men and a rescue squad from the 
gymnasium arrived. Almost a dozen 
men were peering at the dead form 
when the security investigators ar- 
rived. 

All of them were staring at the 
lovely nipples and one long burned 
thigh. 

No one was asking me questions. 
There was no reason to stay in the 
corridor, or even in the building. I 
went outside knowing that I would 
find no comfort at Clo’s apartment. 
I made my way to the parking lot 
behind the dental research building 
and discovered my brown BMW sit- 
ting in my reserved spot. I knew the 
right side was battered in, but I 
didn’t bother to look at it. Clo’s 
note was taped to the steering 
wheel, just as I had seen in the 
video images Cass had shown to 
me. I knew what it said. There was 
no reason to read it over. I put it in 
the glove compartment for future 
reference, and started up the engine. 

The only thing I could do was go 
home, home to the idle mountain 
sanctuary of my mountain observa- 
tory. I gave myself the advice not 
to leave the mountains for a very 
long time. 

My Gemini glasses were on the 
dash tucked away securely in their 
titanium case. I took them out as I 
was driving along toward the main 

GALAXY 



road leading into the valley. I drove 
steering with one hand for a long, 
long time, shifting a lot with the 
other hand, playing it off in my 
head like Phil Hill taking it in for a 
win through the last careful laps of 
his next-to-last race. Electronic 
music would come racing through 
my inner ear only to fade into tin- 
kling laughter. Images of naked, 
dancing women appeared on several 
empty billboards. 

The afternoon traffic was a fren- 
zy .. exactly the kind of traffic I 
try to avoid. The valley was hum- 
ming with unusual excitement. The 
fast-food emporiums were jammed 
with honking automobiles. Hun- 
dreds of greasy children cavorted 
about the garbage receptacles. Fire 
engines and ambulances went 
past me at one intersection. 

A few miles later, 1 was stopped 
by a roadblock set up by the High- 
way Patrol. When it came my turn 
to pass through the blockade, the 
officers looked at me with their in- 
herent suspicion. One of them read 
every word on the BMW’s inspec- 
tion sticker out loud. Another 
checked my driver’s license and 
asked me three times if my name 
was spelled correctly. Each time I 
replied that it was and finally asked, 
‘‘What seems to be going on, 
officer? What is the matter this af- 
ternoon?’ ’ 

The patrolmen moved me- 
chanically like figures from a 
medieval clock tower. A younger, 
blond patrolman, obviously a hick 



rookie, squinted at me with his 
faded blue eyes. ‘‘We’re askin’ the 
questions here, mister. You just 
move along.” I was happy to com- 
ply and wound the BMW out to the 
red line in every gear. I was hitting 
a hundred and twenty as I caught 
the Freeway that cut across the val- 
ley floor and then disappeared into 
the shadows of the mountains. 

I crossed the flat arm basin in 
record time. I knew without a doubt 
that some of the Cassiopeian em- 
issaries had survived the blow- 
out. How could I be sure that they 
weren’t on my trail? How would I 
ever know that they wouldn’t come 
upon me in some distant night seek- 
ing revenge for my part in fusing 
their master, Calimat? Miss Cass 
had flashed away before I even 
knew who she was or what she 
stood for. She had left me in a state 
of complete confusion. 

I drove off the last Freeway exit 
and floored the BMW, racing up 
into the hills catching every turn at 
maximum speed. Phil Hill or not, I 
was leaving all caution behind. 

When I stopped the BMW the 
sun was just closing down on the 
western ridge of the mountains that 
lie across from the Observatory. 
The white buildings had taken on a 
mellow orange tinge and the 
shadows of the trees were edged in 
purple. Corweiller, the Chief Ob- 
server, was out by the parking lot 
tending his vari-colored roses. He 
was wearing blue overalls and his 
famous Swiss alpine glasses that had 



VARIATIONS IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRA 



31 



leather side-curtains attached to the 
gold frames. Corweiller never went 
outside without his Swiss alpine 
glasses. 

I rarely speak to Corweiller so- 
cially and was therefore surprised 
when he waved at me with his gar- 
den shears. Soft humus and a few 
pieces of straw clung to his right 
knee. “Stop in for brandy at six, 
won’t you?” he asked. The sudden 
request was unprecedented in our 
personal protocol. It was definitely 
an honor. Though he continued to 
speak to me I only half heard. My 
head was still buzzing with residual 
crystalline vibrations. 

“We’re taking the night off,” 
Corweiller said. “Nemitz and Frier 
will be observing our watch for 
us.” The sudden prospect of being 
replaced for the evening’s watch 
made me wary. Perhaps I was los- 
ing my job. Budget cuts had been 
the subject of our most recent staff 
rumors. Corweiller must have 
sensed my uneasiness. I couldn’t 
get a grip on the idea of Frier stand- 
ing in at my position. The final 
rocks in my security base were 
crumbling. “Admiralty is coming 
aboard,” Corweiller continued. I 
decoded that to mean that members 
of the Board of Regents were due in 
for an inspection tour. They always 
called for brandy with the Chief 
Observer. 

I was having trouble speaking, 
but Corweiller kept right on talking 
to me in the most pleasant tone 
. “Arvin Dooze of the National 



Science Trust and V.V. Lansloe, 
Chief Regent, are meeting with me 
at five thirty. I would like you to 
meet them at six o’clock in my li- 
brary. I think I may be moving on 
to a new position. Big southern 
hemisphere project in the wind. 
There is no reason why you 
shouldn’t get in on it. It would be a 
step up, you know. We are very de- 
ficient in southern star data. It’s 
quite a gap in the total spectnim of 
knowledge.” 

Threats, a replay from the dying 
images of the Cassiopeian emis- 
saries, swept over me as Corweiller 
finished speaking. I saw myself in 
brief reflection from the other sur- 
faces of his alpine glasses. I asked 
him, “How many light-years is it to 
alpha-Cassiope ia? ” 

He looked at me with vague 
curiosity. “Alpha-Cassiopeia? 
Rather elementary, isn’t it?” 

He gave me the correct figure and 
I said, “Yes, I shall certainly be in 
your library at six. If this new study 
is funded, I should imagine that a 
good deal of time would be oc- 
cupied by the Clouds of Magellan.” 

The Chief Observer beamed with 
anticipation. “Exactly the reason 
for the new interest in southern 
hemisphere stars! The Clouds offer 
us a fabulous opportunity for the 
observation of near space.” 

I walked to the edge of the park- 
ing lot and looked away west into 
the canyon and across the deeper 
shadows there. The sun was just 



32 



GALAXY 




about to touch the far edge of 
Earth. I took off my Gemini glasses 
and gazed carelessly into the golden 
rays, into the brilliant globe itself. I 
had once read that Yogis claim to 
see into other worlds at this time 
each evening and also that some In- 
dians of the Mexican desert claim 
the twilight to be a crack between 
worlds that their men of power 
glide through on their travels to see 
the Spirits. 

I blinked my eyes three or four 
times and began to feel somewhat 
like the wilted, dead peonies that I 
had thought about the night before 
during the Robert Flaherty film. I 
could see the peonies in my grand- 
mother’s garden amid the flatlands 
of Illinois. That garden was a power 
spot for me. I felt my head grow 
large and leafy. 

I let the sunlight flood my cau- 
tious eyes and stood there at the 
edge of the world with my giant 
peony head looking out beyond 
light for the Overseers of Casularix. 

I dared their emissaries to come 
through and confront me. I had a 
comfortable feeling that Corweiller 
was with me, standing behind me 
high in the air above the Earth. His 
dark glasses sparked with many rain- 
bows. His form was clothed in blue 
overalls and he held a galvanized 
watering can in his right hand. 

Laughter shook the ruffled petals 
of my peony head. I knew that 
quite soon I would be in the south- 
ern stars looking out toward the 
Clouds of Magellan. ★

PLCASC by Andrew Ross 

In the beginning was the chuckle. 



THE DAWN OF MAN 

Bruce was making his way back 
to his cave, cautiously poking the 
underbrush ahead of him with a 
stick as he worked his way through 
the thick bushes, dangling vines and 
low branches that made up his 
jungle habitat. As he paused 
momentarily in the middle of a 
patch of large bushes to sample a 
leaf, chewing on it slowly, savoring 
its taste, a rustling sound to his 
right startled him. He promptly 
dropped to the ground and quivered. 
The dead rabbit he’d been carrying 
lay disregarded some yards behind 
him where he had convulsively 
hurled it. 

While Bruce lies cowering in ab- 
ject terror, let us consider his more 
general plight — Bruce was a cave- 
man. Actually, his name wasn’t 
“Bruce”; he didn’t really have a 
name. Those who shared his cave 
with him thought of him variously 
as Tall-One-With-Big-Stick, He- 
Who-Beats-Me, and Meat-Bringer. 
We’ll call him Bruce. 

Bruce was a giant among cave- 
men, towering over five feet tall. 
He had a massive barrel chest, arms 
that hung to his knees, and a hairi- 
ness overall that aspired to but did 
not quite merit being called furry. 
He was by far the strongest in his 
cave, but what mainly distinguished 
Bruce from the other beasts of the 
jungle was the gleam of latent in- 
telligence lurking in his eyes. 

Back to Bruce, as he lay fetally 

TAKE MY AAATE 



curled with his arms covering his 
head, awaiting the fatal attack. 
After a while, no claws having rip- 
ped his back open, Bruce tentatively 
lifted his head and looked around; 
false alarm. 

After several moments spent 
gathering the shreds of his nerve 
Bruce arose and cast about for the 
rabbit he’d accidentally flung away. 
He found it atop an ant hill and 
brushed off most of the ants. Stick 
in one hand, rabbit in the other, he 
recommenced his journey. 

Two hours later, as the sun was 
setting, Bruce and the others were 
gathered together about a cozy fire 
at the entrance to the cave, ripping 
at the now-charred rabbit, snarling 
over it as if they were starving — 
which they were. Which they al- 
ways were. 

Impulsively, Bruce’s mate 
reached for the piece that Bruce had 
reserved for himself. Quick as a 
flash, Bruce grabbed her out- 
stretched arm and bit it. As his 
mate’s piteous moans slowly sub- 
sided into silence the only sound to 
be heard was the peaceful munching 
and grunting of famished cavemen. 

★ ★ ★ 

Meanwhile, three hundred miles 
above, a spaceship orbited. Inverted 
cup on a flat saucer; no visible rocket 
exhausts or other means of propul- 
sion; shimmering electric-orange 
lights; a row of windows circling 
the base of the upside-down cup: it 



37 



was a standard UFO, little different 
in appearance from those that would 
appear in the skies of Earth a few 
million years hence piloted by an 
entirely different race. 

Looking out of one of those win- 
dows at the blue-green planet below 
was Loquar, the ship’s First 
Officer. He looked like grape jello 
with a chopped-fruit filling. Behind 
him was the Captain, who, as befit- 
ted his rank, looked more like 
cherry. 

“It’s a beautiful planet,’’ Loquar 
mused. 

“It certainly is,’’ the Captain, 
picking up Loquar’s thought, re- 
plied. “Too bad about those pre- 
verbal primates down there. 
Damned odd how they haven’t 
made any progress.’’ 

“How long has it been since the 
last visit?’’ 

“Over 24,000'of their years,’’ 
was the Captain’s telepathic re- 
sponse. 

“Well, at least they’re still 
here.’’ 

“According to Survey, there are 
fewer of them than last time. By the 
time of our next visit they may well 
be extinct.” 

Loquar flowed across the deck to 
a large dish and settled into it. 
“What’s holding them back?” 

No one knows. They have oppos- 
able pseudoextensors with good 
dexterity, and they have several 
hundred ccs. of cranial capacity. 
It’s a mystery.” 

Loquar cogitated for a moment 



before thinking ingenuously at his 
Captain: “So what are we going to 
do?” 

The Captain was so alarmed by 
this question that he turned com- 
pletely transparent. Pseudopods rip- 
pling spastically he mentally roared: 
“DO? We’re not going to do any- 
thing. We’re going to leave them 
strictly alone, as per regulations. 
You know we’re not allowed to 
interfere in any way with a poten- 
tially civilized species! We can’t 
even let them know we exist! It 
might warp their development incal- 
culably.” 

“If we don’t do something, they 
won’t have any development to 
warp,” Loquar replied. “And with 
just the tiniest push they could 
make it. They’ve got all that it 
takes.” 

“Obviously not all," came the 
sarcastic rejoinder. 

“Well, no, not all. But that’s all 
the more reason to help them. 
They’re really close, and it could 
make all the difference. I know we 
could help them.” 

“Nothing doing. I retire after two 
more missions, and there’s no way 
I’m going to lose my pension so 
you can play nursemaid to a bunch 
of under-performing apemen.” 

As the spaceship swung around 
the small planet Loquar projected 
eloquent thoughts of a thriving in- 
telligent race that might one day 
reach out apd join the confraternity 
of beings who held sway between 
the stars. The Captain argued for 



38 



GALAXY 



his cottage by the beach. The saucer 
and the argument continued to orbit 
the planet until, finally, a com- 
promise was reached: “Ok, but 
what can you possibly do to help 
them in one-eighteenth of a plane- 
tary revolution?” 

“I’ll think of something,” 
Loquar projected spiritedly. 

★ ★ ★ 

Loquar stood in the clearing look- 
ing down at himself with more than 
a little revulsion. Instead of his 
body flowing gracefully from place 
to place in its normal manner he 
had to separately operate two 
grotesquely rigid lower appendages 
while simultaneously performing a 
balancing act with the rest of his 
body mass. Clumsily he began to 
practice walking around in a circle, 
learning to coordinate his new 
body. As he walked he thought 
about how fortunate it was that his 
wife couldn’t see him in his present 
condition. 

Satisfied at last that he had 
achieved some degree of mobility, 
Loquar considered what to do next; 
he still had not decided just what he 
was going to do to help the natives 
in their fight for survival. 

Whatever he did had to be do- 
able without technical devices of 
any kind. Nor was he allowed to 
leave any evidence that the primates 
had received assistance. The Cap- 
tain was angry enough at him for 
talking him into endangering his 

TAKE MY MATE 



pension by letting Loquar make the 
trip. Loquar was quite certain that if 
he so much as gently bent the 
smallest regulation in a detectable 
way the Captain would have him 
fibulated on the spot. 

As Loquar was thinking these 
thoughts the obvious happened: 
Bruce and Loquar met. After catch- 
ing his first glimpse of him, Bruce 
had ducked behind a tree and was 
observing Loquar with considerable 
interest. As he watched the incredi- 
bly clumsy and unarmed stranger 
stumble about in circles Bruce made 
his decision. The stranger would be 
good to eat. 

Bruce emerged into the clearing. 
Stick raised, he edged towards 
Loquar. Loquar watched Bruce 
nervously stalk him. When Bruce 
had finally got up his nerve to 
strike, Loquar reached out. Sud- 
denly Bruce stood transfixed, un- 
able to so much as twitch as 
Loquar dove beneath the surface of 
his mind. 

Calmly Loquar examined Bruce’s 
past, reviewed the images of his 
life: the campfires, the hunts, the 
cave, the everpresent vermin. At 
last he pulled his mind back, glad 
to be out of Bruce’s head. 

“Not even a nice place to visit,” 
he thought to himself. 

Tired from standing so long, 
Loquar clumsily seated himself and 
made Bruce do likewise opposite 
him. He felt stymied. If he couldn’t 
think of a way to help Bruce, the 
natives of this planet were probably 



39 



doomed. And, aside from the regu- 
lations, given the amount of time he 
had left that help would have to 
take the form of a message. 

“But what,” he wondered, “can 
I say to a creature whose entire 
mental equipment is invested in 
thoughts of ingestion, protection 
and erection?” 

Suddenly Loquar’s cogitations 
were interrupted by the Captain. 
“Haven’t you finished yet?” 

“No,” Loquar grumbled. “I 
need more time.” 

“Ten more minutes. Then I want 
you back up here, done or not.” 

“All right.” 

Loquar thought for a minute. He 
looked at Bruce, the apish face 
drawn in terror, the muscles tensed, 
straining to move. Suddenly Loquar 
was inspired. He projected a 
thought into Bruce’s mind. 

Bruce was puzzled. His brow fur- 
rowed and his head tilted. Then the 
corners of his mouth turned up, his 
lips stretched. Bruce made a noise, 
a harsh guttural sound coming from 
deep in his throat. He chuckled 
again, awkwardly and a little 
louder. A laugh burst from his 
throat. The first laugh in the history 
of the planet. It tumbled out, louder 
and faster. Bruce began to shake 
from the intensity of it. 

Loquar stood up. He released 
Bruce from his mental bonds, then 
stumbled off into the jungle and 
vanished as Bruce continued to 
laugh. 

Bruce lay on the ground and 



beat at it with his fists, roaring hys- 
terically. 

Eventually Bruce sat up and 
wiped his eyes. Still chuckling, he 
stood up and began to walk back 
towards the cave. Every so often he 
would burst into laughter again and 
the animals nearby would flee from 
the strange noise. 

★ ★ ★ 

Aboard the spaceship a crew 
member was helping Loquar out of 
his caveman suit. As he slit the suit 
open Loquar spilled onto the deck. 

“Oh, that feels good. It’s murder 
standing upright like that.” 

“The Captain wants to see you 
immediately.” 

“That figures.” 

Loquar headed towards the 
Bridge. The crew member thought 
after him, “What do I do with this 
thing?” 

“Burn it.” 

Loquar found the Captain flowing 
nervously back and forth. The Cap- 
tain turned to him. “Did you do 
anything that will get us in trou- 
ble?” 

“No.” 

“That’s good. My wife would 
have killed me if this cost us our 
beach house.” 

Loquar chuckled softly. 

The Captain asked, “So what did 
you do to help them?” 

“I told one of them an old 
joke.” 



40 



GALAXY 



The Captain looked at him 
blankly. 

Loquar flowed to the window and 
looked down at the rapidly di- 
minishing world. As the ship fled 
the solar system, leaving Earth once 
again alone in the darkness of 
space, Loquar explained .... 

* ★ * 

Bruce and the others were seated 
around the fire, squabbling over the 
remains of the small wild pig that 
Bruce had caught. Suddenly a bolt 
of lightning flashed nearby, fol- 
lowed by a bellow of thunder. They 
all jumped up and ran to the back 
of the cave. 



When nothing else happened 
Bruce slowly emerged from the 
darkness. He looked back at the 
others still shivering in the back 
and began to chuckle. Soon he was 
laughing uproariously. The others, 
frightened by this strange sound, 
refused to emerge. Bruce continued 
to laugh as he seated himself near 
the fire. 

Finally, Bruce’s laughter having 
died down to an occasional chuckle, 
the others edged back to the fire, 
watching Bruce warily. 

Still chuckling, Bruce, Father 
of Humor on Earth, tried to figure 
out a way to explain what was so 
funny. if

HERBERT 






PART in OF IV 
WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

Keila Jedrik, a Human female of 
the planet Dosadi, has shed her false 
persona as a minor bureaucrat to 
concentrate on her role as warlord. 
Her purpose is to free Dosadi from 
imprisonment behind the barrier 
‘God Wall’ which dims its sun and 
isoiates it from the rest of the uni- 
verse. 

Dosadi ’s two sentient species, the 
frog-like Gowachin and the Humans, 
are descended from a memory-erased 
population which volunteered for a 
secret long-term psychological exper- 
iment. The descendants learned early 
that they were puppets in a contrived 
hell, its plants and animals poison to 
both Human and Gowachin unless 
raised in hydroponic isolation. 
Dosadis know mostly their city of 
Chu where food is relatively pure and 
the surrounding Rim where people 
live short, violent lives in a teeming 
scramble for admittance to the city. 
They do not know about the feder- 
ated planets of the ConSentiency be- 
yond their God Wall. 

Keila Jedrik, bred and trained to 
break this bondage, sets a race war 
into motion as other forces muster 
beyond the planetary barrier. There, 
the ConSentiency’s Bureau of Sabo- 
tage (a sophisticated ombudsman-like 
ministry) has learned of Dosadi ’$ ex- 
istence but not its location. BuSab 
knows only that unidentified 
Gowachin hired a Caleban to im- 
prison Dosadi ’s people 

Calebans are one of the great “use- 
ful mysteries.” They are visible stars 
in the ConSentient universe and pro- 
vide the federation with jumpdoors 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



through which one can pass in a sin- 
gle step from planet to planet. Some 
believe Calebans are part of the Tap- 
risiot phenomenon. The stubby, log- 
like Taprisiot people provide mind- 
to-mind communication across the 
parsecs. 

BnSab Agent Jorj X. McKie, a 
Human who is friendly with a Cale- 
ban calling herself Fannie Mae, gets 
the Dosadi assignment from his 
Bureau Chief, Bildoon, who is a 
PanSpechi, member of a species 
which apes Human form but passes 
one ego from person to person in a 
creche-family. 

Summoned to the Gowachin home 
planet, Tandaloor, place of their 
mythological progenitor, Mrreg, 
McKie is confronted by Aritch, High 
Magister of the most powerful 
Gowachin Phylum, and by a deadly 
Wreave female named Ceylang, rep- 
resentative of another ConSentient 
species which is famed for ability to 
understand alien behavior. If McKie 
offends her, he risks vendetta with 
Ceylang’s gigantic extended family. 
Ceylang is being trained by the 
Gowachin as a Legum, an adept in 
Gowachin Law. McKie is the only liv- 
ing non-Gowachin who holds Legum 
status. 

Forced to become Aritch’s Legum, 
McKie accepts the Phylum’s sacred 
box containing a book, a knife and a 
rock — symbols of Gowachin Law. 
This is a complex legal structure 
where the life of any person entering 
the Courtarena may be forfeit. After 
McKie frustrates an attack by 
Ceylang, these facts emerge: 

Dosadi’s imprisoned millions are 
increasingly immune to memory era- 
sure and are, in Gowachin eyes, 
“monstrous.” 



43 



A quasi-reiigious government under 
a Dosadi Govrachin Elector named 
Broey rules the imprisoned planet. 

Anything is for sale on Dosadi — 
secrets, bodies, temporary protection, 
food, armies . 

Among Broey’s aides are two Hu- 
mans, the Warlord Gar and Gar’s 
daughter, Tria, who secretly plot to 
build another city on Dosadi in de- 
fiance of their religious mandate. 

Jedrik’s chauffeur, a Human 
named Havvy, tells her that a Jorj X. 
McKie is being sent as a Rim infil- 
trator, and that he comes from be- 
yond the God Wail. Jedrik already 
knew this through her own espionage 
network. She sees McKie as her key 
to breaking through the God Wall 
but, unknown to her, McKie brings 
with him the dangerous tools and 
weapons of his agency employment 
plus a Taprisiot linkage which, should 
he be killed, is intended to provide 
BuSab with all data he has gathered 
to that point. 

Jedrik relies on her own 
capabilities, including a mental simu- 
lation model of each person she must 
dominate to free Dosadi. She can an- 
ticipate Broey’s actions. She knows 
that Havvy is a non-Dosadi, but he 
came to her flawed, useless against 
the God Wall. She sees Havvy and 
other non-Dosadis as dolts, often 
dangerous but susceptible to being 
baited and trapped. McKie is walking 
into her trap. 

Arriving in Chu after a hair-raising 
ride in an armored vehicle through 
Rim battlegrounds, McKie sees al- 
most immediately that Dosadi is not 
what Aritch had led him to expect. 
Aritch had said that Dosadi was an 
attempt to create a population resis- 
tant to mediocrity imposed from 



above, arguing that ancestors always 
volunteer their descendants for what- 
ever happens and without the in- 
formed consent of the descendants. 
He says that one of Dosadi’s ‘test sub- 
jects’ will destroy this ‘monster’ even 
if the Gowachin do not. 

McKie wonders if Dosadi might be 
a convoluted attempt to make 
Gowachin Law the basis for ail Con- 
Sentient Law. Gowachin distrust law, 
saying it injures societies. They seek 
ways to disarm or remove law when 
problems arise. Gowachin distrust 
any community of professionals, espe- 
cially legal professionals. The highest 
use of Gowachin Law is to dissolve 
old law while applying justice. McKie 
realizes the Gowachin trained him to 
solve their Dosadi dilemma, but be 
knows that Gowachin are so ulti- 
mately civilized they have come full 
circle into a form of primitive savage- 
ry. There’s no easy way out of his 
predicament: to fulfill his Legum oath 
and serve his BuSab agency he must 
experience this Dosadi ‘monster’ with 
his own flesh. Many unanswered 
questions plague him. 

Why have Dosadi Humans taken on 
Gowachin characteristics and vice 
versa. The species cannot interbreed. 
Why are Gowachin training a 
Wreave? 

While waiting for his first contact 
on Dosadi, McKie has tried to call his 
Caleban friend, Fannie Mae. She 
warns him that soon he may not be 
able to leave the planet in his own 
“body/node.” She warns him also 
that a contract prevents her from 
helping him in ways he has asked. 

Meanwhile, Elector Broey talks to 
the Caleban who acts as the God of 
the Heavenly Veil to imprison Dosadi 
and he learns that McKie is coming. 



44 



GALAXY 



Praying in a cell beneath his graiuz 
breeding pool, Broey hides some of 
his thoughts from the Caleban guard- 
ian. “God uses people; people use 
God.’’ He is. deeply aware of the 
graiuz pool above him where 
Gowachin males hunt down and de- 
vour their newborn tads — testing al- 
most to extinction. 

While the Human vs. Gowachin 
war grows hotter as Jedrik intended, 
Broey’s Human aide, Tria, leads a 
commando raid to try capturing Jed- 
rik. The raid fails and Tria’s agent is 
killed in a way that suggests 
Gowachin ritual murder. 

Broey returns to his headquarters 
after a fruitless questioning of the 
battlewagon driver who brought 
McKie into Chu. Broey tries to dis- 
miss Gar and Tria, but Gar reveals 
that he is building a Rim City and 
that he has a secret force of Rim-born 
fanatics. With race war almost out of 
control, Broey has little choice but to 
agree to keep Gar and Tria in posi- 
tions of power. However, he mounts a 
massive campaign to find the bias- 
phemous Rim City with its store of 
non-poisonous foods. Broey realizes 
he is behaving precisely as Jedrik 
wants but has no choice. 

McKie, having made secret rendez- 
vous with Jedrik, is shocked by her 
brutality and her casual revelation 
that she knows he comes from beyond 
the God Wall. She confiscates his wal- 
let of dangerous tools even though he 
warns her that it is booby-trapped. 
An aide takes away the wallet and re- 
turns uniqjured with the wallet open, 
its contents available. McKie begins 
to understand Aritch’s judgement 
about the Dosadis and realizes that 
survival here requires him to become 
as ruthless as any Dosadi. 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



Jedrik takes McKie to her head- 
quarters after detecting “real in- 
telligence’’ in him. She wonders why 
he never sharpened that intelligence. 
At her headquarters is a cage confin- 
ing an aged Gowachin male, Pcharky. 
She tells McKie there’s no counting 
the number of people Pcharky has 
helped escape from Dosadi, adding: 
“Soon, I may persuade him to be of 
service to me.’’ 

Seeing the terrible energies shim- 
mering on the bars of Pcharky’s cage, 
McKie wonders if Dosadi may be an 
investigation of the Caleban mystery. 
Jedrik gives him no time to investi- 
gate this. She takes him to her room 
where she makes violent love to him, 
all the time watching, reading him. 
Afterward, she accuses him of trying 
to catch her with softness. McKie de- 
cides she’s insane, but she won’t let 
him sleep, questioning him, demand- 
ing he tell about male-female relation- 
ships ‘outside.’ 

Back on Tandaloor, Aritch meets 
with Ceylang who says that soon 
McKie will be more Dosadi than the 
Dosadis. Aritch warns Ceylang that 
she must learn McKie as though she 
lived “in his skin,’’ adding that 
McKie is capable of defeating her in 
such a way that “your Wreave uni- 
verse would shower him with adula- 
tion for his victory.’’ This depends, of 
course, Aritch says, on whether 
McKie survives Dosadi. 

"Their law! It is a dangerous founda- 
tion for non-outhentic traditions. It is 
no more than o device to justify false 
ethics!" 

— Gowachin comment on 
ConSentient Law 



45 



W HiLE THEY DRESSED in the dim 
dawn light coming through the sin- 
gle window, McKie began testing 
what Jedrik meant by being his 
teacher. 

“Will you answer any question I 
ask about Dosadi?” 

“No.” 

Then what areas would she with- 
hold from him? He saw it at once; 
those areas where she gained and 
held personal power. 

“Will anyone resent it that 
we . had sex together?” 

“Resent? Why should anyone re- 
sent that?’ ’ 

“I don’t . .” 

“Answer my question!” 

“Why do I have to answer your 
every question?” 

“To stay alive.” 

“You already know everything 
I . .” 

She brushed this aside. 

“So the people of your ConSen- 
tiency sometimes resent the sexual 
relationships of others. They are not 
sure, then, how they use sex to hold 
power over others.” 

He blinked. Her quick, slashing 
analysis was devastating. 

She peered at him. 

“McKie, what can you do here 
without me? Don’t you know yet 
that the ones who sent you intended 
you to die here?” 

“Or survive in my own peculiar 
way.” 

She considered this. It was 
another idea about McKie which 
she had put aside for later evalua- 
tion. Indeed, he might well have 
hidden talents which her questions 
had not yet exposed. What annoyed 
her now was the sense that she 
didn’t know enough about the Con- 

46 



Sentiency to explore this. Could not 
take the time right now to explore 
it. His response disturbed her. It 
was as though everything she could 
possibly do had already been de- 
cided for her by powers of which 
she knew next to nothing. They 
were leading her by the nose, 
perhaps, just as she led 
Broey . just as those mysterious 
Gowachin of the Con Sentiency ob- 
viously had led McKie . poor 
McKie. She cut this short as unprof- 
itable speculation. Obviously, she 
had to begin at once to search out 
McKie’s talents. Whatever she dis- 
covered would reveal a great deal 
about his ConSentiency. 

“McKie, I hold a great deal of 
power among the Humans and even 
among some Gowachin in the War- 
rens . and elsewhere. To do this, 
I must maintain certain fighting 
forces, including those who fight 
with physical weapons.” 

He nodded. Her tone was that of 
lecturing to a child, but he accepted 
this, recognizing the care she took 
with him. 

“We will go first,” she said, “to 
a nearby training area where we 
maintain the necessary edge on one 
of my forces.” 

Turning, she led him out into the 
hall and down a stairway which 
avoided the room of the cage. 
McKie was reminded of Pcharky, 
though, thinking about that gigantic 
expenditure of space with its strange 
occupant. 

“Why do you keep Pcharky 
caged?” he asked, addressing Jed- 
rik’s back. 

“So I can escape.” 

She refused to elaborate on this 
odd answer. 



GALAXY 



Presently, they emerged into a 
courtyard nestled into the solid 
walls of towering buildings. Only a 
small square of sky was visible di- 
rectly overhead and far away. Arti- 
ficial lighting from tubes along the 
walls provided an adequate illumi- 
nation. It revealed two squads fac- 
ing each other in the center of the 
courtyard. They were Humans, both 
male and female; all carried 
weapons — a tube of some sort with 
a wandlike protrusion from the end 
near their bodies. Several other 
Humans stood at observation posi- 
tions around the two squads. There 
was a guard station with a desk at 
the door through which McKie and 
Jedrik had emerged. 

“That’s an assault force,” Jedrik 
said, indicating the squads in the 
courtyard. She turned and consulted 
with the two young men at the 
guard station. 

McKie made a rough count of the 
squads: about two hundred. It was 
obvious that everything had stopped 
because of Jedrik’s presence. He 
thought the force was composed of 
striplings barely blooded in 
Dosadi’s cruel necessities. This 
forced him to re-evaluation of his 
own capabilities. 

From Jedrik’s manner with the 
two men, McKie guessed she knew 
them well. They paid close attention 
to everything she said. They, too, 
struck him as too young for respon- 
sibility. 

The training area was another 
matter. It bore a depressing similar- 
ity to other such facilities he’d seen 
in the backwaters of the ConSen- 
tiency. War games were a constant 
lure among several species, a lure 
which BuSab had managed thus far 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



to channel into such diversions as 
weapons fetishes. 

Through the omnipresent stink, 
McKie smelled the faint aroma of 
cooking. He sniffed. 

Turning to him, Jedrik spoke: 
“The trainees have just been fed. 
That’s part of their pay.” 

It was as though she’d read his 
mind and now she watched him for 
some reaction. 

McKie glanced around the train- 
ing area. They’d just been fed here? 
There wasn’t a scrap or crumb on 
the ground. He thought back to the 
restaurant, belatedly aware of a fas- 
tidious care ,with food that he’d seen 
and passed right over. 

Again, Jedrik demonstrated the 
ease with which she read his reac- 
tions, his very thoughts. 

“Nothing wasted,” she said. 

She turned away. 

McKie looked where her attention 
went. Four women stood at the far 
side of the courtyard, weapons in 
their hands. Abruptly, McKie fo- 
cused on the woman to the left, a 
competent looking female of middle 
years. She was carrying a ... it 
couldn’t be, but . 

Jedrik headed across the court- 
yard toward the woman. McKie fol- 
lowed, peered closely at the wom- 
an’s weapon. It was an enlarged 
version of the pentrate from his kit! 
Jedrik spoke briefly to the woman. 
“Is that the new one?” 

“Yes. Stiggy brought it up this 
morning.” 

“Useful?” 

“We think so. It focuses the ex- 
plosion with somewhat more con- 
centration than our equipment.” 
“Good. Carry on.” 

There were more training cadre 

47 



near the wall behind the women. 
One, an older man with one arm, 
tried to catch Jedrik’s attention as 
she led McKie toward a nearby 
door. 

“Could you tell us when 
we . 

“Not now.” 

In the passage beyond the door, 
Jedrik turned and confronted 
McKie. 

“Your impressions of our train- 
ing? Quick!” 

“Not sufficiently versatile.” 

She’d obviously probed for his 
most instinctive reaction, demand- 
ing the gut response unmonitored by 
reason. The answer brought a glow- 
ering expression to her face, an 
emotional candor which he was not 
to appreciate until much later. Pres- 
ently, she nodded. 

“They are a commando. More 
functions of a commando should be 
interchangeable. Wait here.” 

She returned to the training area. 
McKie, watching through the open 
door, saw her speak to the woman 
with the pentrate. When Jedrik re- 
turned, she nodded to McKie with 
an expression of approval. 

“Anything else?” 

“They’re awfully damned young. 
You should have a few seasoned 
officers among them to put a rein 
on dangerous impetuosity.” 

“Yes, I’ve already set that in mo- 
tion. Hereafter, McKie, I want you 
to come out with me every morning 
for about an hour. Watch the train- 
ing but don’t interfere. Report your 
reactions to me.” 

He nodded. Clearly, she consid- 
ered him useful and ttiat was a step 
in the right direction. But it was an 
idiotic assignment. These violent in- 



fants possessed weapons which ; 
could make Dosadi uninhabitable. ■ 
There was an atavistic excitement in 
the situation, though. He couldn’t 
deny that. Something in the Human 
psyche responded to mass vio- 
lence . really, to violence of any 
sort. It was related to Human sexu- 
ality, an ancient stirring from the 
most primitive times. i 

Jedrik was moving on, however. 
“Stay close.” 

They were climbing an inside , 
stairway now and McKie, hurrying 
to keep up, found his thoughts 
locked on that pentrate in the hands 
of one of Jedrik’s people. The 
speed with which they’d copied and | 
enlarged it dazzled him. It was 1 
another demonstration of why 
Aritch feared Dosadi. 

At the top of the stairs, Jedrik ; 
rapped briefly at a door. A male i 
voice said: “Come in.” 

The door swung open and McKie 
found himself presently in a small i 
unoccupied room with an open por- 
tal at the far wall into what ap- 
peared to be a larger, well lighted 
area. Voices speaking so softly as 
to be unintelligible came from 
there. A low table and five cramped 
chairs occupied the small room. 
There were no windows, but a 
frosted overhead fixture provided 
shadowless illumination. A large 
sheet of paper with colored graph 
lines on it covered the low table. I 
A swish of fabric brought ; 
McKie’s attention to the open por- i 
tal. A short, slender woman in a 
white smock, grey hair and the 
dark, penetrating stare of someone 
accustomed to command, entered 
followed by a slightly taller man in 
the same white. He looked older 

GALAXY 



than the woman except that his hair 
remained a lustrous black. His eyes, 
too, held that air of command. The 
woman spoke. 

“Excuse the delay, Jedrik. We’ve 
been changing the summation. 
There’s now no point where Broey 
can anticipate and change the transi- 
tion from riots to full-scale war- 
fare.” 

McKie was surprised by the ab- 
ject deference in her voice. This 
woman considered herself to be far 
below Jedrik. The man took the 
same tone, gesturing to chairs. 

“Sit down, please. This chart is 
our summation.” 

As the woman turned toward 
him, McKie caught a strong whiff 
of something pungent on her breath, 
a not unfamiliar smell. He’d caught 
traces of it several times in their 
passage through the Warrens. She 
went on speaking as Jedrik and 
McKie slipped into chairs. 

“This is not unexpected.” She 
indicated the design on the paper. 

The man intmded. 

“We’ve been telling you for 
some time now that Tria is ready to 
come over.” 

“She’s trouble,” Jedrik said. 

“But Gar . .” 

It was the woman, arguing, but 
Jedrik cut her off. 

“I know: Gar does whatever she 
tells him to do. The daughter runs 
the father. He thinks she’s the most 
wonderful thing that ever happened, 
able to . .” 

“Her abilities are not the issue,” 
the man said. 

The woman spoke eagerly. 

“Yes, it’s her influence on Gar 
that ...” 

“Neither of them anticipated my 
THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



moves,” Jerik said, “but I antici- 
pated their moves.” 

The man leaned across the table, 
his face close to Jedrik’s. He ap- 
peared suddenly to McKie like a 
large, dangerous animal — dangerous 
because his actions could never be 
fully predicted. His hands twitched 
when he spoke. 

“We’ve told you every detail of 
our findings, every source, every 
conclusion. Now, are you saying 
you don’t share our assessment 
of . .” 

“You don’t understand,” Jedrik 
said. 

The woman had drawn back. 
Now, she nodded. 

Jedrik said: 

“It isn’t the first time I’ve had to 
reassess your conclusions. Hear me: 
Tria will leave Broey when she’s 
ready, not when he’s ready. It’s the 
same for anyone she. serves, even 
Gar.” 

They spoke in unison: 

“Leave Gar?” 

“Leave anyone. Tria serves only 
Tria. Never forget that. Especially 
don’t forget it if she comes over to 
us.” 

The man and woman were silent. 

McKie thought about what Jedrik 
had said. Her words were another 
indication that someone on Dosadi 
might have other than personal 
aims. Jedrik’s tone was unmistak- 
able: she censured and distrusted 
Tria because Tria served only self- 
ish ambition. Therefore Jedrik (and 
this other pair by inference) served 
some unstated mutual purpose. Was 
it a form of patriotism they served, 
species oriented? BuSab agents 
were always alert for this dangerous 
form of tribal madness, not neces- 



48

sarily to suppress it, but to make 
certain it did not explode into a vio- 
lence deadly to the ConSentiency. 

The white-smocked woman, after 
mulling her own thoughts, spoke: 

“If Tria can’t be enlisted 
for . what I mean is we can use 
her own self-serving to hold her.” 
She corrected herself. “Unless you 
believe we cannot convince her 
we’ll overcome Broey.” She 
chewed at her lip, a fearful expres- 
sion in her eyes. 

A shrewd look came over Jed- 
rik’s face. 

“What is it you suspect?” 

The woman pointed to the chart 
on the table. 

“Gar still shares in the major de- 
cisions. That shouldn’t be, but it is. 
If he . .” 

The man spoke with subservient 
eagerness. 

“He has some hold on Broey!” 

The woman shook her head. 



“Or Broey plays a game other 
than the one we anticipated.” 

Jedrik looked at the woman, the 
man, at McKie. She spoke as 
though to McKie, but McKie re- 
alized she was addressing the air. 

“It’s a specific thing. Gar has re- 
vealed something to Broey. I know 
what he’s revealed. Nothing else 
could force Broey to behave this 
way.” She nodded at the chart. 
“We have them!” 

The woman ventured a question. 
“Have we done well?” 

“Better than you know.” 

The man smiled, then: 

“Perhaps this is the time to ask if 
we could have larger rooms. The 
damn’ children are always moving 
the furniture. We bump ...” 

“Not now!” 



50 



Jedrik arose. McKie followed her 
example. 

“Let me see the children,” Jed- 
rik said. 

The man turned to the open por- 
tal- 

“Get out here, you! Jedrik wants 

I ** 

you! 

Three children came scurrying 
from the other room. The woman 
didn’t even look at them. The man 
favored them with an angry glare. 
He spoke to Jedrik. 

“They’ve brought no food into 
this house in almost a week.” 

McKie studied the children care- 
fully as he saw Jedrik was doing. 
They stood in a row just inside the 
room and, from their expressions it 
was impossible to tell their reaction 
to the summons. They were two 
girls and a boy. The one on the 
right, a girl, was perhaps nine; on 
the left, another girl, was five or 
six. The boy was somewhat older, 
perhaps twelve or thirteen. He fa- 
vored McKie with a glance. It was 
the glance of a predator who recog- 
nizes ready prey but who already 
has eaten. All three bore more re- 
semblance to the woman than to the 
man, but Ithe parentage was obvi- 
ous: the eyes, the set of the ears, 
nose . 

Jedrik had completed her study. 
She gestured to the boy. 

“Start sending him to the second 
training team.” 

“About time,” the woman said. 
“We’ll be glad to get him out of 
here.” 

“Come along, McKie.” 

In the hall, Jedrik said: 

“To answer your question, 
they’re pretty typical.” 

McKie, who had only wondered 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



silently, swallowed in a dry throat. 
The petty goals of these people: to 
get a bigger room where they could 
live without bumping into furniture. 
He’d sensed no affection for each 
other in that couple. They were 
companions of convenience. There 
had been not the smallest hint of 
emotion for each other when they 
spoke. McKie found it difficult to 
imagine them making love, but ap- 
parently they did. They had pro- 
duced three children. 

Realization came like an explo- 
sion in his head. Of course they 
showed no emotion! What other 
protection did they have? On 
Dosadi, anything you cared for was 
a club to beat you into somebody 
else’s line. And there was another 
thing. 

McKie spoke to Jedrik’s back as 
they went down the stairs. 

“That couple . they’re ad- 
dicted to something.” 

Surprisingly, Jedrik stopped, 
looked back up at him. 

“How else do you think I hold 
such a pair? The substance is called 
dij. It’s very rare. It comes from 
the far mountains, far beyond 
the . far beyond. The Rim sends 
parties of children as bearers to ob- 
tain dis for me. In a party of fifty, 
thirty can expect to die on such a 
trek. Do you get the measure of it, 
McKie?” 

Once more, they headed down 
the stairs. 

McKie, realizing she’d taken the 
time to teach him another lesson 
about Dosadi, could only follow, 
stunned, while she led him into a 
room where technicians bleached 
the sun-darkened areas of his skin. 

When they emerged, he no longer

carried the stigma of Fylash Gate.

QUESTION: Who governs the 

governors? 

ANSWER: Entropy. 

— Gowochin Riddle 



“It is no longer classifiable as 
rioting,” the aide said. 

He was a short Gowachin with 
pinched features and he looked 
across the room to where Broey sat 
facing a dead communicator. There 
was a map on the wall behind the 
aide, its colors made brilliant by 
harsh morning light coming in the 
east windows. Below the map, a 
computer terminal jutted from the 
wall. Occasionally, it clicked. 

Gar came into the room from the 
hall, peered around as though look- 
ing for someone, left. 

Broey noted the intrusion, 
glanced at the map. 

“Still no sign of where she’s 
gone to ground?” 

"Nothing certain.” 

“The one who paraded McKie 
through the streets . .” 

“Clearly an expendable under- 
ling.” 

“Where did they go?” 

The aide indicated a place on the 
map, a group of buildings in the 
Warrens to the northwest. 

Broey stared at the blank face of 
his communications screen. He’d 
been tricked again. He knew it. 
That damnable Human female! Vio- 
lence in the city teetered on the 
edge of full scale war: Gowachin 
against Human. And still nothing, 

52 



not even a hint at the location of 
Gar’s Rim stores, the blasphemous 
factories. It was an unstable condi- 
tion which could not continue much 
longer. 

His communications screen came 
alive with a report: violent fighting 
near Gate Twenty-One. Broey 
glanced at the map. That made it 
more than one hundred clearly de- 
fined battles between the species 
along an unresolved perimeter. The 
report spoke of new weapons and 
unsuccessful attempts to capture 
specimens. 

Gate Twenty-One? 

That wasn’t far from the place 
where McKie had been paraded 
through . 

Several things slipped into a new 
relationship in Broey’s mind. He 
looked at his aide who stood wait- 
ing obediently at the map. 

“Where’s Gar?” 

Aides were summoned, sent run- 
ning. Gar was not to be found. 

“Tria?” 

She, too, was unavailable. 

Gar’s fanatics remained neutral, 
but more of Jedrik’s pattern was 
emerging. Everything pointed to an 
exquisite understanding of the 
weaknesses implicit in the behavior 
of Gar and Tria. 

And / thought I was the only one 
who saw that! 

Broey hesitated. 

Why would the God not speak to 
him? Other than to say “I am 
watched.” 

Broey felt tricked and betrayed in 
his innermost being. This had a 
cleansing effect on his reason. He 
could only depend on himself. And 
he began to sense a larger pattern in 
Jedrik’s behavior. Was it possible 



GALAXY 



that Jedrik shared his goals? The 
possibility excited him. 

He looked at the aides who’d 
come running with the negative in- 
formation about Gar and Tria, 
began to snap orders. 

“Get our people out of all those 
Warrens except that corridor to the 
northeast. Reinforce that area. Ev- 
eryone else fall back to the sec- 
ondary walls. Let no Humans inside 
that perimeter. Block all gates. Get 
moving!” 

This last was shouted as his aides 
hesitated. 

Perhaps it already was too late. 
He realized now that he’d allowed 
Jedrik to bait and distract him. It 
was clear that she’d created in her 
mind an almost perfect simulation 
model of Broey. And she’d done it 
from a Liaitor position! Incredible. 
He could almost feel sorry for Gar 
and Tria. They were like puppets 
dancing to Jedrik’s strings. 

I was no better. 

It came over him that Jedrik’s 
simulation probably encompassed 
this very moment of realization. 
Admiration for her permeated him. 

Superb! 

Quietly, he issued orders for the 
sequestering of Gowachin females 
within the inner graluz bastions 
which he’d had the foresight to pre- 
pare. His people would thank him. 

Those who survived the next few 
hours.

— from an ancient Human mystic 
THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



By the third morning McKie felt 
that he might have lived all of his 
life on Dosadi. The place demanded 
every element of attention he could 
muster. 

He stood alone in Jedrik’s room, 
staring absently at the unmade bed. 
She expected him to put the place 
in order before her return. He knew 
that. She’d told him to wait here 
and had gone away on urgent busi- 
ness. He could only obey. 

Concerns other than an unmade 
bed distracted him, though. He felt 
now that he understood the roots of 
Aritch’s fears. The Gowachin of 
Tandaloor might very well destroy 
this place even if they knew that by 
doing so they blasted open that 
bloody region where every sentient 
hid his most secret fears. He could 
see this clearly now. How the Run- 
ning Phylum expected him to avoid 
that monstrous decision was a more 
elusive matter. 

There were secrets here. 

McKie sensed Dosadi like a ma- 
lignant organism beneath his feet, 
jealously keeping those secrets from 
him. This place was the enemy of 
the ConSentiency, but he found 
himself emotionally siding with 
Dosadi. It was betrayal of BuSab, 
of his Legum oath, every- 
thing . .but he could not prevent 
that feeling or recognition of it. In 
the course of only a few genera- 
tions, Dosadi had become a particu- 
lar thing. Monstrous? Only if you 
held to your own precious myths. 
Dosadi might be the greatest cleans- 
ing force the ConSentiency had ever 
experienced. 

The whole prospect of the Con- 



53 



Sentiency had begun to sicken him. 
And Aritch’s Gowachin. Gowachin 
Law? Stuff Gowachin Law! 

It was quiet in Jedrik’s room. 
Painfully quiet. 

He knew that out on the streets of 
Chu there was violent warfare be- 
tween Gowachin and Human. 
Wounded had been rushed through 
the training courtyard while he was 
there with Jedrik. Afterward, she’d 
taken him to her command post, a 
room across the hall and above 
Pcharky’s cage. He’d stood nearby, 
watched her performance as though 
she were a star on an entertainment 
circuit and he a member of the au- 
dience. It was fascinating. Broey 
will do this. Broey will give that 
order. And each time, the reports 
revealed how precisely she had an- 
ticipated her opponent. 

Occasionally, she mentioned Gar 
or Tria. He was able to detect the 
subtle difference in her treatment of 
that pair. 

On their second night together, 
Jedrik had aroused his sexual appe- 
tites softly, deftly. She had treated 
him to a murmurous compliance 
and afterward had leaned over him 
on an elbow to smile coldly. 

“You see, McKie: I can play 
your game.’’ 

Shockingly, this had opened an 
area of awareness within him which 
he’d not even suspected. It was as 
though she’d held up his entire pre- 
vious life to devastating observa- 
tion. 

And he was the observer! 

Other beings formed lasting rela- 
tionships and operated from a se- 
cure emotional base. But he was a 
product of BuSab, the Gowachin 
. and much that had gone be- 



fore. It had become increasingly 
obvious to him why the Gowachin 
had chosen him to groom for this 
particular role. 

7 was damaged and they could 
rebuild me the way they wanted! 

Well, the Gowachin could still be 
surprised by what they produced. 
Dosadi was evidence of that. They 
might not even suspect what they’d 
actually produced in McKie. 

He was bitter with a bitterness he 
knew must’ve been fermenting in 
him for years. The loneliness of his 
own life with its central dedication 
to BuSab had been brought to a 
head by the loneliness of this im- 
prisoned planet. An incredible jum- 
ble of emotions had sorted them- 
selves out and he felt new purpose 
burning within him. 

Power! 

Ahhhh . that was how it felt 
to be Dosadi! 

He’d turned away from Jedrik’s 
cold smile, pulled the blankets 
around his shoulder. 

Thank you, loving teacher. 

Such thoughts roamed through his 
mind as he stood alone in the room 
the following day and began to 
make the bed. After her revelation, 
Jedrik had resumed her interest in 
his memories, napping only to awa- 
ken him with more questions. 

In spite of his sour outlook, he 
still felt it his duty to examine her 
behavior in every possible light his 
imagination could produce. Nothing 
about Dosadi was too absurd. He 
had to build a better picture of this 
society and its driving forces. 

Before returning to Jedrik’s 
room, he’d made another tour of the 
training courtyard with her. There’d 
been more new weapons adapted 



54 



GALAXY 



from his kit and he’d realized the 
courtyard was merely Jedrik’s test- 
ing ground, that there must be many 
more training areas for her follow- 
ers. 

McKie had not yet revealed to 
her that Aritch’s people might ter- 
minate Dosadi’s people with vio- 
lence. She’d been centering on this 
at dawn. Even while they shared the 
tiny toilet cubicle off her room 
she’d pressed for answers. 

For a time, McKie had diverted 
t her with questions about Pcharky. 
What were the powers in that cage? 
At one point, he’d startled her. 

“Pcharky knows something valu- 
able he hopes to trade for his free- 
dom.’’ 

“How’d you know?” 

“It’s obvious. I’ll tell you some- 
thing else: he came here of his own 
free will . for whatever pur- 
pose.” 

“You learn quickly, McKie.” 

She was laughing at him and he 
glared at her. 

“All right! I don’t know that 
purpose, but it may be that you 
only think you know it.” 

For the briefest flicker, something 
dangerous glared from her eyes, 
then: 

“Your jumpdoors have brought 
us many fools, but Pcharky is one 
of the biggest fools. I know why he 
came. There’ve been many like 
him. Now . there are only a 
few. Broey, for all of his power, 
cannot search out his own Pcharky. 
And Keila Jedrik is the one who 
frustrates him.” 

Too late, she realized that McKie 
had goaded her into this perfor- 
mance. How had he done that? 
He’d almost found out too much too 



soon. It was dangerous to under- 
estimate this naive intruder from 
beyond the God Wall. 

Once more, she’d begun probing 
for things he had not yet revealed. 
Time had protected him. Aides had 
come urging an early inspection of 
the new weapons. They were 
needed. 

Afterward, they’d gone to the 
command post and then to breakfast 
in a Warren dining room. All 
through breakfast, he’d plied her 
with questions about the fighting. 
How extensive was it? Could he see 
some of the prisoners? Were they 
using the weapons built from the 
patterns in his kit? Were they win- 
ning? 

Sometimes she merely ignored 
his questions. Most of her answers 
were short, distracted. Yes. No. 
No. Yes. McKie realized she was 
answering in monosyllables to fend 
him off. He was a distraction. 
Something important had been 
communicated to her and he’d 
missed it. Although this angered 
him, he tried to mask the emotion, 
striving to penetrate her wall of 
concern. Oddly, she responded 
when he changed his line of 
questioning to the parents of the 
three children and the conversation 
there. 

“You started to designate a par- 
ticular place: ‘Beyond the . .’ Be- 
yond what?” 

“It’s something Gar thinks I 
don’t know. He thinks only his 
death fanatics have that kind of rap- 
port with the Rim.” 

He stared at her, caught by a 
sudden thought. By now, he knew 
much about Gar and Tria. She an- 
swered his questions about them 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT

with candor, often using him openly 
to clarify her own thoughts. 
But . death fanatics? 

“Are these fanatics homosex- 
ual?” 

She pounced. 

“How’d you know?” 

“A guess.” 

“What difference would it 
make?” 

“Are they?” 

“Yes.” 

McKie shuddered. 

She was peremptory. 

“Explain!” 

“When Humans for any reason 
go terminal where survival of their 
species is concerned, it’s relatively 
easy to push them the short step fur- 
ther into wanting to die.” 

“You speak from historical evi- 
dence?” 

“Yes.” 

“Example.” 

“With rare exceptions, primitive 
Humans of the tribal eras reserved 
their homosexuals as the ultimate 
shock troops of desperation. They 
were the troops of last resort, sent 
into battle as berserkers who ex- 
pected, who wanted to die.” 

She had to have the term 
‘berserkers’ explained, then showed 
by her manner that she believed 
him. She considered this, then; 

“What does your ConSentiency 
do about this susceptibility?” 

“We take sophisticated care to 
guide all natural sexual v^ants into 
constructive, survival activities. We 
protect them from the kinds of pres- 
sures which might tip them over 
into behavior destructive of the 
species.” 

Only later had McKie realized 
she had not answered his question: 

56 



beyond what? She’d rushed him off 
to a conference room where more 
than twenty Humans were assem- 
bled, including the two parents 
who’d made the chart about Tria 
and Gar. McKie realized he didn’t 
even know their names. 

It put him at a disadvantage not 
knowing as many of these people 
by sight and name as he should. 
They, of course, had ready 
memories of everyone important 
around them and, when they used a 
name , often did it with such blurred 
movement into new subjects that he 
was seldom sure who had been 
named. He saw the key to it, 
though. Their memories were an- 
chored in explicit references to rela- 
tive abilities of those around them, 
relative dangers. And it wasn’t so 
much that they concealed their emo- 
tions as that they managed their 
emotions. Nowhere in their 
memories could there be any emo- 
tive clouding such as thoughts of 
love or friendship. Such things 
weakened you. Everything operated 
on the strict basis of quid pro quo 
and you’d better have the cash 
ready . whatever that cash might 

'^^McKie, pressed all around by 
questions from the people in the 
conference room, knew he had only 
one real asset; he was a key they 
might use to open the God Wall. 
Very important asset, but unfortu- 
nately owned by an idiot. 

Now, they wanted his informa- 
tion about death fanatics. They 
milked him dry then sent him away 
like a child who has performed for 
his elders but is sent to his room 
when important matters are brought 
up for discussion.

— Gowochin Low 



By the fourth morning of the bat- 
tle for Chu, Tria was in a vile 
humor. Her forces had established 
lines holding about one-eighth of 
the total Warren territory, mostly 
low buildings except along Broey’s 
corridor to the Rim. She did not 
like the idea that Jedrik’s people 
held an unobstructed view down 
onto most of the death fanatics’ ter- 
ritory. And most of those leaders 
who’d thrown in their lot with Tria 
were beginning to have second 
thoughts, especially since they’d 
come to realize that this enclave had 
insufficient food production 
facilities to maintain itself. The 
population density she’d been 
forced to accept was frightening: 
almost triple the Warren norm. 

Thus far, neither Broey nor Jed- 
rik had moved in force against her. 
Tria had finally been brought to the 
inescapable conclusion that she and 
Gar were precisely where Jedrik 
wanted them. They’d been cut out 
of Broey’s control as neatly and 
cleanly as though by a knife. There 
was no going back. Broey would 
never accept Human help under 
present circumstances. That, too, 
spoke of the exquisite care with 
which Jedrik had executed her plan. 

Tria had moved her command 
post during the night to a high 
building which faced the canyon 
walls to the north. Only the river 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



with a single gate under it separated 
her from the Rim. She’d slept 
badly, her mind full of worries. 
Chief among her worries was the 
fact that none of the contact parties 
she’d sent out to the Rim had re- 
turned. There’d been no fires on the 
Rim ledges during the night. No 
word from any of her people out 
there. 

Why? 

Once more, she contemplated her 
position, seeking some advantage, 
any advantage. One of her lines was 
anchored on Broey’s corridor to the 
Rim, one line on the river wall with 
its single gate, and the rest of her 
perimeter meandered through a 
series of dangerous salients from the 
fifth wall to the river. 

She could hear sounds of battle 
along the far side of Broey’s cor- 
ridor. Jedrik’s people used weapons 
which made a great deal of noise. 
Occasionally, an explosive projec- 
tile landed in Tria’s enclave. These 
were rare, but she’d taken casualties 
and the effect on morale was de- 
structive. That was a major problem 
with fanatics: they demanded to be 
used, to be wasted. 

Tria stared down at the river, 
aware of the bodies drifting on its 
poison currents — both Human and 
Gowachin bodies, but more 
Gowachin than Human. Presently, 
she turned away from the scene, 
padded into the next room and 
roused Gar. 

“We must contact Jedrik,” she 
said. 

He rubbed sleep from his eyes. 

“No! We must wait until we 
make contact with our people on the 
Rim. Then we can ...” 

“Faaaaa!” 



She’d seldom showed that much 
disgust with him. 

“We’re not going to make con- 
tact with our people on the Rim. 
Jedrik and Broey have seen to that. 
It wouldn’t surprise me if they were 
cooperating to isolate us.’’ 

“But we’ve ...” 

“Shut up, father!” She held up 
her hands, stared at them! “I was 
never really good enough to be one 
of Broey’s chief advisors. I always 
suspected that. I always pressed too 
hard. Last night, I reviewed as 
many of my decisions as I could. 
Jedrik deliberately made me look 
good. She did it oh so beautifully!” 
“But our forces on the 
Rim . .” 

“May not be ours! They may be 
Jedrik’s.” 

“Even the Gowachin?” 

“Even the Gowachin.” 

Gar could hear a ringing in his 
ears. Contact Jedrik? TTirow away 
all of their power? 

“I’m good enough to recognize 
the weakness of a force such as 
ours,’’ Tria said. “We can be 
goaded into spending ourselves 
uselessly. Even Broey didn’t see 
that, but Jedrik obviously did. Look 
at the salients along her perimeter!” 
“What have salients ...” 

“They can be pinched off and 
obliterated! Even you must see 
that.” 

“Then pull back and ...” 
“Reduce our territory?” She 
stared at him aghast. “If I even in- 
timate I’m going to do that, our 
auxiliaries will desert wholesale. 
Right now they’re ...” 

“Then attack!” 

“To gain what?” 

Gar nodded. Jedrik would fall 

58 



back across mined areas, blast the 
fanatics out of existence. She held 
enough territory that she could af- 
ford such destruction. Clearly, she’d 
planned on it. 

“Then we must pinch off Broey’s 
corridor.” 

“That’s what Jedrik wants us to 
do. It’s the only negotiable counter 
we have left. That’s why we must 
contact Jedrik.” 

Gar shook his head in despair. 

Tria was not finished, though. 

“Jedrik might restore us to a 
share of power in the Rim city if 
we bargain for it now. Broey would 
never do that. Do you understand 
now the mistake you made with 
Broey?” 

“But Broey was going to . .” 

“You failed to follow my orders, 
father. You must see now why I 
always tried to keep you from mak- 
ing independent decisions.” 

Gar fell into abashed silence. 
This was his daughter, but he could 
sense his peril. 

Tria spoke. 

“I will issue orders presently to 
all of our commanders. They will 
be told to hold at all costs. They 
will be told that you and I will try 
to contact Jedrik. They will be told 
why.” 

“But how can . .” 

“We will permit ourselves to be 
captured.”

— from the Trial of Trials 



Many things conspired to frus- 
trate McKie. Few people other than 
Jedrik answered his questions. Most 
responded as though to a cretin. 
Jedrik treated him as though he 
were a child of unknown potential. 
At times, he knew he amused her. 
Other times, she punished him with 
an angry glance, by ignoring him or 
just by going away ... or worse, 
sending him away. 

It was now late afternoon of the 
fifth day in the battle for Chu and 
Broey’s forces still held out in the 
heart of the city with their slim cor- 
ridor to the Rim. He knew this from 
reports he’d overheard. He stood in 
a small room off Jedrik’s command 
post, a room containing four cots 
where, apparently, she and/or her 
commanders snatched occasional 
rest. One tall, narrow window 
looked out to the south Rim. McKie 
found it difficult to realize that he’d 
come across that Rim just six days 
previously. 

Clouds had begun to gather over 
the Rim’s terraced escarpments, a 
sure sign of a dramatic change in 
the weather. He knew that much, at 
least, from his Tandaloor briefings. 
Dosadi had no such thing as 
weather control. Awareness of this 
left him feeling oddly vulnerable. 
Nature could be so damnably ca- 
pricious and dangerous when you 
had no grip on her vagaries. 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



McKie blinked, held his breath 
for a moment. 

Vagaries of nature. 

The vagaries of sentient nature 
had moved the Gowachin to set up 
this experiment. Did they really 
hope to control that vast, seething 
conglomerate of motives? Or had 
they some other reason for Dosadi, 
a reason which he had not yet 
penetrated? Was this, after all, a 
test of Caleban mysteries? He 
thought not. 

He knew the way Aritch and 
aides said they’d set up this exper- 
iment. Observations here bore out 
their explanations. None of that data 
was consistent with an attempt to 
understand the Calebans. Only that 
brief encounter with Pcharky, a 
thing which Jedrik no longer was 
willing to discuss. 

No matter how he tried, McKie 
couldn’t evade the feeling that 
something essential lay hidden in 
the way this planet had been set 
upon its experimental course 
. something the Gowachin 
hadn’t revealed, something they 
perhaps didn’t even understand 
themselves. What’d they done 
at the beginning? They had this 
place, Dosadi, the subjects, the 
Primary . yes, the Primary. The 
inherent inequality of individuals 
dominated Gowachin minds. And 
there was that damnable DemoPol. 
How had they mandated it? Better 
yet: how did they maintain that 
mandate? 

Aritch ’s people had hoped to ex- 
pose the inner workings of sentient 
social systems. So they said. But 
McKie was beginning to look at 
that explanation with Dosadi eyes, 
with Dosadi scepticism. What had 



59 



Fannie Mae meant about not being 
able to leave here in his own 
body/node? How could he be Jed- 
rik’s key to the God Wall? Could 
Pcharky really help Dosadis to es- 
cape this planet? McKie knew he 
needed more information than he 
could hope to get from Jedrik. Did 
Broey have this information? McKie 
wondered if he might in the end 
have to climb the heights to the 
Council Hills for his answers. Was 
that even possible now? 

When he’d asked for it, Jedrik 
had given him almost the run of his 
building, warning: 

“Don’t interfere.’’ 

Interfere with what? 

When he’d asked, she’d just 
stared at him. 

She had, however, taken him 
around to familiarize everyone with 
his status. He was never quite sure 
what that status might be except 
that it was somewhere between 
guest and prisoner. 

Jedrik had required minimal con- 
versation with her people. Often, 
she’d used only hand waves to con- 
vey the necessary signals of pas- 
sage. The whole traverse was a les- 
son for McKie, beginning with the 
door guards. 

“McKie.” Pointing at him. 

The guards nodded. 

Jedrik had other concerns. 

“Team Nine?” 

“Back at noon.” 

“Send word.” 

Everyone subjected McKie to a 
hard scrutiny which he felt certain 
would let them identify him with 
minimal interruption. 

There were two elevators — one 
an express from a heavily guarded 
street entrance on the side of the 



building, the other starting above 
the fourth level at the ceiling of 
Pcharky’s cage. They took this one, 
went up, pausing at each floor for 
guards to see him. 

When they returned to the cage 
room, McKie saw that a desk had 
been installed just inside the street 
door. The father of those three wild 
children sat there watching Pcharky, 
making occasional notations in a 
notebook. McKie had a name for 
him now: Ardir. 

Jedrik paused at the desk. 

“McKie can come and go with 
the usual precautions.” 

McKie, addressing himself finally 
to Jedrik, had said: 

“Thanks for taking this time with 
me.” 

“No need to be sarcastic, 
McKie.” 

He had not intended sarcasm and 
reminded himself once more that 
the usual amenities of the ConSen- 
tiency suffered a different interpreta- 
tion here. 

Jedrik glanced through Ardir’s 
notes, looked up at Pcharky, back 
to McKie. Her expression did not 
change. 

“We will meet for dinner.” 

She left him then. 

For his part, McKie had ap- 
proached Pcharky’s cage, noting the 
tension this brought to the room’s 
guards and observers. The old 
Gowachin sat in his hammock with 
an indifferent expression on his 
face. The bars of the cage emitted 
an almost indiscernible hissing as 
they shimmered and glowed. 

“What happens if you touch the 
bars?” McKie asked. 

The Gowachin jowls puffed in a 
faint shrug. 



60 



GALAXY 



McKie pointed. 

“There’s energy in those bars. 
What is that energy? How is it 
maintained?” 

Pcharky responded in a hoarse 
croaking. 

“How is the universe main- 
tained? When you first see a thing, 
is that when it was created?” 

“Is it a Caleban thing?” 

Shrug. 

McKie walked around the cage, 
studying it. There were glistening 
bulbs wherever the bars crossed 
each other. The rods upon which 
the hammock was suspended came 
from the ceiling. They penetrated 
the cage top without touching it. 
The hammock itself appeared to be 
fabric. It was faintly blue. He re- 
turned to his position facing 
Pcharky. 

“Do they feed you?” 

No answer. 

Ardir spoke from behind him. 
“His food is lowered from the 
ceiling. His excreta are hosed into 
the reclamation lines.” 

McKie spoke over his shoulder. 

“I see no door into the cage. 
How’d he get in there?” 

“It was built around him accord- 
ing to his own instructions.” 

“What are the bulbs where the 
bars cross?” 

“They came into existence when 
he activated the cage.” 

“How’d he do that?” 

“We don’t know. Do you?” 
McKie shook his head from side 
to side. 

“How does Pcharky explain 
this?” 

“He doesn’t.” 

McKie had turned away to face 
Ardir, probing, moving the focus of 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



questions from Pcharky to the plan- 
etary society itself. Ardir’s answers, 
especially on matters of religion and 
history, were banal. 

Later, as he stood in the room off 
the command post reviewing the 
experience, McKie found his 
thoughts touching on a matter which 
had not even come into question. 

Jedrik and her people had known 
for a long time that Dosadi was a 
Gowachin creation. They’d known 
it long before McKie had appeared 
on the scene. It was apparent in the 
way they focused on Pcharky, in 
the way they reacted to Broey. 
McKie had added one significant 
datum: that Dosadi was a Gowachin 
experiment. But Jedrik’s people 
were not using him in the ways he 
might expect. She said he was the 
key to the God Wall, but how was 
he that key? 

The answer was not to be found 
in Ardir. That one had not tried to 
evade McKie’s questions, but the 
answers betrayed a severely limited 
scope to Ardir’s knowledge and 
imagination. 

McKie felt deeply disturbed by 
this insight. It was not so much 
what the man said as what he did 
not say when the reasons for speak- 
ing openly in detail were most de- 
manding. Ardir was no dolt. This 
was a Human who’d risen high in 
Jedrik’s hierarchy. Many specula- 
tions would’ve crossed his mind. 
Yet he made no mention of even 
the more obvious speculations. He 
raised no questions about the way 
Dosadi history ran to a single cut- 
off point in the past without any 
trace of evolutionary beginnings. He 
did not appear to be a religious per- 
son and even if he were, Dosadi 



61 



would not permit the more blatant 
religious inhibitions. Yet Ardir re- 
fused to explore the most obvious 
discrepancies in those overt reli- 
gious attitudes McKie had been told 
to expect. Ardir played out the right 
attitudes, but there was no basis for 
them underneath. It was all surface. 

McKie suddenly despaired of 
ever getting a deep answer from any 
of these people . even from Jed- 
rik. 

An increase in the noise level out 
in the command post caught 
McKie ’s attention. He opened the 
door, stood in the doorway to study 
the other room. 

A new map had been posted on 
the far wall. There was a position 
board, transparent and covered with 
yellow, red and blue dots, over the 
map. Five women and a man — all 
wearing earphones — worked the 
board, moving the colored markers. 
Jedrik stood with her back to 
McKie, talking to several 
commanders who’d just come in 
from the streets. They still carried 
their weapons and packs. It was 
their conversation which had at- 
tracted McKie. He scanned the 
room, noted two communications 
screens at the left wall, both inac- 
tive. They were new since his last 
view of the room and he wondered 
at their purpose. 

An aide leaned in from the hall- 
way, called out: 

“Gate Twenty-One just reported. 
Everything has quieted there. They 
want to know if they should keep 
their reserves on the alert.” 

“Have them stand down,” Jedrik 
said. 

“The two prisoners are being 
brought here,” the aide added. 

62 



“I see it,” Jedrik said. 

She nodded toward the position 
board. 

McKie, following the direction of 
her gaze, saw two yellow markers 
being moved with eight blue com- 
panions. Without knowing how he 
understood this, he saw that this 
must be the prisoners and their es- 
cort. There were tensions in the 
command post which told him this 
was an important event. Who were 
those prisoners? 

One of Jedrik’s commanders 
spoke. 

“I saw the monitor at . .” 

She was not listening to him and 
he broke off. Two people on the 
position board exchanged places, 
trading earphones. The messenger 
who’d called out the information 
about the gate and the prisoners had 
gone. Another messenger came in 
presently, conferred in a soft voice 
with people near the door. 

In a few moments, eight young 
Human males entered carrying Gar 
and Tria securely trussed with what 
appeared to be shining wire. McKie 
recognized the pair from Aritch’s 
briefings. The escort carried their 
prisoners like so much meat, one at 
each leg and each arm. 

“Over here,” Jedrik said, indi- 
cating two chairs facing her. 

McKie found himself suddenly 
aware in an extremely Dosadi way 
of many of the nuances here. It 
filled him with elation. 

The escort crossed the room, not 
bothering to steer clear of all the 
furniture. The messenger from the 
hallway delayed his departure, re- 
luctant to leave. He’d recognized 
the prisoners and knew something 
important was about to happen. 



GALAXY 



Gar and Tria were dumped into 
the two chairs. 

“Release their bindings,” Jedrik 
said. 

The escort obeyed. 

Jedrik waited, staring across at 
the position board. The two yellow 
and eight blue markers had been 
removed. She continued to stare at 
the board, though. Something there 
was more important than these two 
prisoners. She pointed to a cluster 
of red markers in an upper comer. 

“See to that.” 

One of her commanders left the 
room. 

McKie took a deep breath. He’d 
spotted the flicker of her movement 
toward the commander who’d 
obeyed. So that was how she did it! 
McKie moved farther into the room 
to put Jedrik in profile to him. She 
made no response to his movement, 
but he knew she was aware of him. 
He stepped closer to what he saw as 
the limit of her tolerance, noted a 
faint smile as she turned toward the 
prisoners. 

There was an abmpt silence, one 
of those uncomfortable moments 
when people realize there are things 
they must do, but everyone is reluc- 
tant to start. The messenger still 
stood by the door to the hall, ob- 
viously wanting to see what wolild 
happen here. The escort who’d 
brought the prisoners remained 
standing in a group at one side. 
They were almost huddled, as 
though seeking protection in their 
own numbers. 

Jedrik glanced across at the mes- 
senger. 

“You may go.” 

She nodd^ to the escort. 

“And you.” 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



McKie held his cautious distance, 
waiting, but Jedrik took no notice 
of him. He saw that he not only 
would be allowed to stay, but that 
he was expected to use his wits, his 
off- world knowledge. Jedrik had 
read things in his presence — a nor- 
mal distrust, caution, patience. And 
the fears, of course. 

Jedrik 'took her time with the 
prisoners. She leaned forward, 
examined first Tria, then Gar. From 
the way she looked at them it was 
clear to McKie she weighed many 
possibilities on how to deal with 
this pair. She was also building the 
tensions and this had its effect. Gar 
broke. 

“Broey has a way of describing 
people such as you,” Gar said. 
“He calls you ‘rockets’ which is to 
say you are like a display which 
shoots up into the sky . and falls 
back.” 

Jedrik grinned. 

McKie understood. Gar was not 
managing his emotions very well. It 
was a weakness. 

“Many rockets in this universe 
must die unseen,” Jedrik said. 

Gar glared at her. He didn’t like 
this response, glanced at Tria, saw 
from her expression that he had 
blundered. 

Tria spoke now, smiling faintly. 

“You’ve taken a personal interest 
in us, Jedrik.” 

To McKie, it was as though he’d 
suddenly crossed a threshold into 
the understanding of another lan- 
guage. Tria’s was a Dosadi state- 
ment, carrying many messages. 
She’d said that Jedrik saw an oppor- 
tunity for personal gain here and 
that Tria knew this. The faint smile 
had been the beginning of the 



63 



statement. McKie felt a new awe at 
the special genius of the Dosadi 
awareness. He moved a step closer. 
There was something else about 
Tria . something odd. 

“What is that one to you?’’ 

Tria spoke to Jedrik, but a flick 
of the eyes indicated McKie. 

“He has a certain utility,” Jedrik 
said. 

“Is that the reason you keep him 
near you?” 

“There’s no single reason.” 

“There’ ve been certain 
rumors ...” 

“One uses what’s available,” 
Jedrik said. 

“Did you plan to have children 
by him?” 

Jedrik shook with silent mirth. 
McKie understood that Tria probed 
for weaknesses, found none. 

“The breeding period is so in- 
capacitating for a female,” Tria 
said. 

The tone was deliberately goad- 
ing and McKie waited for a re- 
sponse. 

Jedrik nodded. 

“Offspring produce many reper- 
cussions down through the genera- 
tions. Never a casual decision for 
those of us who understand.” 

Jedrik looked at Gar, forcing 
McKie to shift his attention. 

Gar’s face went suddenly bland, 
which McKie interpreted as shock 
and anger. The man had himself 
under control quickly, however. He 
stared at McKie, directed a question 
to Jedrik. 

“Would his death profit us?” 

Jedrik glanced at McKie. 

Shocked by the directness of the 
question, McKie was at least as in- 
trigued by the assumptions in Gar’s 

64 



question. “Us!” Gar assumed that 
he and Jedrik had common cause. 
Jedrik was weighing that assump- 
tion and McKie, filled with elation, 
understood. He also recognized 
something else and realized he 
could now repay all of Jedrik’s pa- 
tient teaching. 

Tria! 

Something about Tria’s way of 
holding her head, the inflections in 
her spoken Galach, struck a chord 
in McKie’s memory. Tria was a 
Human who’d been trained by a 
PanSpechi — that way of moving the 
eyes before the head moved, the 
peculiar emphases in her speech 
mannerisms. But there were no 
PanSpechi on Dosadi. Or were 
there? 

None of this showed on McKie’s 
face. He continued to radiate dis- 
trust, caution, patience. But he 
began to ask himself if there might 
be another loose thread in this 
Dosadi mystery. He saw Jedrik 
looking at him and, without think- 
ing about it, gave her a purely 
Dosadi eye signal to follow him, re- 
turned to the adjoining room. It was 
a measure of how she read him that 
she came without question. 

“Yes?” 

He told her what he suspected. 

“These PanSpechi, they are the 
ones who can grow a body to simu- 
late that of another species?” 

“Except for the eyes. They have 
faceted eyes. Any PanSpechi who 
could act freely and simulate 
another species would be only the 
surface manifestation. The freely 
moving one is only one of five 
bodies; it’s the holder of the ego, 
the identity. This passes periodically 
to another of the five. It’s a 

GALAXY 



PanSpechi crime to prevent that 
transfer by surgically fixing the ego 
in only one of the bodies.” 

Jedrik glanced out the doorway. 
“You’re sure about her?” 

“The pattern’s there.” 

“The faceted eyes, can that be 
disguised?” 

“There are ways . contact 
lenses or a rather delicate operation. 
I’ve been trained to detect such 
things, however, and I can tell you 
that the one who trained her is not 
Gar.” 

She looked at him. 

“Broey?” 

“A graluz would be a great place 
to conceal a creche but . .” He 
shook his head. “. I don’t think 
so. From what you tell me about 
Broey . .” 

“Gowachin,” she agreed. “Then 
who?” 

“Someone who influenced her 
when she was quite young.” 

“Do you wish to interrogate the 
prisoners?” 

“Yes, but I don’t know their po- 
tential value.” 

She stared at him in open won- 
der. His had been an exquisitely 
penetrating Dosadi-style statement. 
It was as though a McKie she 
thought she knew had been trans- 
formed suddenly right in front of 
her eyes. He was not yet suffi- 
ciently Dosadi to trust completely, 
but she’d never expected him to 
come this far this quickly. He did 
deserve a more detailed assessment 
of the military situation and the rel- 
ative abilities of Tria and Gar. She 
delivered this assessment in the 
Dosadi way — bare-bones words, 
swift, clipped to an essential spare- 
ness which assumed a necessary 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



broad understanding by the listener. 

Absorbing this, McKie sensed 
where she limited her recital, tailor- 
ing it for his abilities. In a way, it 
was similar to a response by his 
Daily Schedule back on Central 
Central. He could see himself in her 
attitudes, read her assessment of 
him. She was favoring him with a 
limited, grudging respect tempered 
by a certain fondness as by a parent 
toward a child. And he knew that 
once they returned to the other 
room, the fondness would be locked 
under a mask of perfect conceal- 
ment. It was there, though. It was 
there. And he dared not betray her 
trust by counting on that fondness, 
else it would be locked away 
forever. 

“I’m ready,” he said. 

They returned to the command 
post, McKie with a clearer picture 
of how to operate here. There was 
no such thing as mutual, unquestion- 
ing trust. You always questioned. 
You always managed. A sort of 
grudging respect was the nearest 
they’d reveal openly. They worked 
together to survive or when it was 
overwhelmingly plain that there was 
personal advantage in mutual ac- 
tion. Even when they united, they 
remained ultimate individualists. 
They suspected any gift because no 
one gave away anything freely. The 
safest relationships were those in 
which the niches of the hierarchy 
were clear and solidly held — 
minimum threat from above and 
from below. The whole thing re- 
minded McKie of stories told about 
behavior in Human bureaucracies of 
the classical period before deep 
space travel. And many years be- 
fore he had encountered a multi- 

65 



species corporation which had be- 
haved similarly until the ministra- 
tions of BuSab had shown them the 
error of their ways. They’d used 
every dirty trick available: bribing, 
spying and other forms of covert 
and overt espionage, fomenting dis- 
sent in the opposition, assassination, 
blackmail and kidnapping. Few in 
the ConSentiency had not heard of 
InterRealm Supply, now defunct. 

McKie stopped three paces from 
the prisoners. 

Tria spoke first. 

“Have you decided what to do 
with us?” 

“There’s useful potential in both 
of you,” McKie said, “but we have 
other questions.” 

The ‘we’ did not escape Tria or 
Gar. They both looked at Jedrik, 
who stood impassively at McKie ’s 
shoulder. 

McKie addressed himself to Gar. 

“Is Tria really your daughter, 
your natural child?” 

Tria appeared surprised and, with 
his new understanding, McKie re- 
alized she was telling him she 
didn’t care if he saw this reaction, 
that it suited her for him to see this. 
Gar, however, had betrayed a 
flicker of shock. By Dosadi stan- 
dards, he was dumbfounded. Then 
Tria was not his natural daughter, 
but until this moment, Tria had 
never questioned their relationship. 

“Tell us,” McKie said. 

The Dosadi spareness of the 
words struck Gar like a blow. He 
looked at Jedrik. She gave every 
indication of willingness to wait 
forever for him to obey, which was 
to say that she made no response 
either to McKie’s words or Gar’s 
behavior. 

66 



Visibly defeated. Gar returned his 
attention to McKie. 

“I went with two females, only 
the three of us, across the far moun- 
tains. We tried to set up our own 
production of pure food there. 
Many on the Rim tried that in those 
days. They seldom came back. 
Something always happens ... the 
plants die for no reason, the water 
source runs dry, something steals 
what you grow. The Gods are jeal- 
ous. That’s what we always said.” 

He looked at Tria, who studied 
him without expression. 

“One of the two women died the 
first year. The other was sick by the 
following harvest season but sur- 
vived through the next spring. It 
was. during that harvest ... we 
went to the garden . .ha! The 
garden! This child was there. We 
had no idea of where she’d come 
from. She appeared to be seven or 
eight years old but her reactions 
were those of an infant. That hap- 
pens often enough on the Rim — the 
mind retreats from something too 
terrible to bear. We took her in. 
Sometimes you can train such a 
child back to usefulness. When the 
woman died and the crop failed, I 
took Tria and we headed back to 
the Rim. That was a very bad time. 
When we returned ... I was sick. 
Tria helped me then. We’ve been 
together ever since.” 

McKie found himself deeply 
touched by this recital and hard put 
to conceal his reaction. He was not 
positive that he did conceal it. With 
his new Dosadi awareness, he read 
an entire saga into that sparse ac- 
count of events which probably 
were quite ordinary by Rim stan- 
dards. He found himself enraged by 

GALAXY 




1^ A

the other data which could be read 
into Gar’s words. 

PanSpechi trained! 

That was the key. Aritch’s people 
had wanted to maintain the purity of 
their experiment: only two species 
permitted. But it would be informa- 
tive to examine PanSpechi applica- 
tions. Simple. Take a Human 
female child. Put her exclusively 
under PanSpechi influence for seven 
or eight years. Subject that child to 
selective memory erasure. Hand her 
over to convenient surrogate parents 
on Dosadi. 

And there was more: Aritch lied 
when he said he knew little about 
the Rim, that the Rim was outside 
the experiment. 

As these thoughts went through 
his head, McKie returned to the 
small adjoining room. Jedrik fol- 
lowed. She waited while he assem- 
bled his thoughts. 

Presently, McKie looked at her, 
laid out his deductions. When he 
finished, he glanced at the doorway. 

‘T need to learn as much as I can 
about the Rim.” 

“Those two are a good source.” 
“But don’t you require them for 
your other plans,, the attack on 
Broey’s corridor?” 

“Two things can go forward si- 
multaneously. You will return to 
their enclave with them as my 
lieutenant. That’ll confuse them. 
They won’t know what to make of 
that. They will answer your 
questions. And in their confusion 
they’ll reveal much that they might 
otherwise conceal from you.” 
McKie absorbed this. Yes 
. Jedrik did not hesitate to put 
him into peril. It was an ulti- 
mate message to everyone. McKie 



would be totally at the mercy of 
Gar and Tria. Jedrik was saying: 
“See! You cannot influence me by 
any threat to McKie.” In a way, 
this protected him. In an extremely 
devious Dosadi way, this removed 
many possible threats to McKie and 
it told him much about what her 
true feelings toward him could be. 
He spoke to this. 

“I detest a cold bed.” 

Her eyes sparkled briefly, the 
barest touch of moisture, then, arm- 
ing him: 

“No matter what happens to me, 
McKie — free us!”

“Unless she makes a mistake or 
we find some unexpected advan- 
tage, it’s only a matter of time until 
she overruns us,” Broey said. 

He sat in his aerie command post 
at the highest point of the dominant 
building on the Council Hills. The 
room was an armored oval with a 
single window about fifteen meters 
away directly in front of Broey 
looking out on sunset through the 
river’s canyon walls. A small table 
with a communicator stood just to 
his left. Four of his commanders 
waited near the table. Maps, posi- 
tion boards and the other appurte- 
nances of command with their at- 



68 



GALAXY 



tendants occupied most of the 
room’s remaining space. 

Broey’s intelligence service had 
just brought him the report that Jed- 
rik had t^cen Gar and Tria captive. 

One of his commanders, slender 
for a Gowachin and with other de- 
privation marks left from birth on 
the Rim, glanced at his three com- 
panions, cleared his throat. 

“Is it time to capitulate?” 

Broey shook his head in a Human 
gesture of negation. 

It’s time / told them, he thought. 

He felt emptied. God refused to 
speak to him. Nothing in his world 
obeyed the old mandates. 

We've been tricked. 

The Powers of the God Wall had 
tricked him, had tricked his world 
and all of its inhabitants. 
They’d . 

“This McKie,” the commander 
said. 

Broey swallowed, then: 

“I doubt if McKie has even the 
faintest understanding of how she 
uses him.” 

He glanced at the reports on his 
communicator table, a stack of re- 
ports about McKie. Broey’s in- 
telligence service had been active. 

“If we captured or killed 
him . .” the commander ventured. 

“Too late for that,” Broey said. 

“Is there a chance we won’t have 
to capitulate?” 

“There’s always that chance.” 

None of the four commanders 
liked the answer. 

Another of them, fat and silky 
green, spoke up: 

“If we have to capitulate, how 
will we know the . .” 

“We must never capitulate, and 
we must make certain she knows 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



this,” Broey said. “She means to 
exterminate us.” 

There! He’d told them. 

They were shocked but beginning 
to understand where his reasoning 
had led him. He saw the signs of 
understanding come over their 
faces. 

“The corridor ...” one of them 
ventured. 

Broey merely stared at him. The 
fool must know they couldn’t get 
more than a fraction of their forces 
onto the Rim before Jedrik and Tria 
closed off that avenue. And even if 
they could escape to the Rim, what 
could they do? They hadn’t the 
faintest idea of where Tria’s Rim 
forces had hidden the food stocks or 
where the damned factories were 
buried. 

“If we could rescue Tria,” the 
slim commander said. 

Broey snorted. He’d prayed for 
Tria to contact him, to open negoti- 
ations. There’d been not a word, 
even after she’d fallen back into 
that impossible enclave. Therefore, 
Tria had lost control of her people 
outside the city. All the other evi- 
dence supported this conclusion. 
There was no contact with the Rim. 
Jedrik ’s people had taken over out 
there. Tria would’ve sent word to 
him the minute she recognized the 
impossibility of her position. Any 
valuable piece of information, any 
counter in this game would’ve 
leaped into Tria’s awareness and 
she’d have recognized who the 
highest bidder must be. 

Who was the highest bidder? 
Tria, after all, was Human. 

Broey sighed. 

And McKie — an idiot savant 
from beyond the God Wall, a 



69 



weapons expert. Jedrik must’ve 
known. But how? Did the Gods talk 
to her? Broey doubted this. Jedrik 
gave every evidence of being too 
clever to be sucked in by trickster 
Gods. 

More clever, more wary, more 
Dosadi than /. 

She deserved the victory. 

Broey arose and went to the win- 
dow. His commanders exchanged 
worried glances behind him. Could 
Broey think them out of this mess? 

A corner of his slim corridor to 
the Rim was visible to Broey. He 
could not hear the battle, but explo- 
sive orange blossoms told him the 
fighting continued. He knew the 
gamble Jedrik took. Those 
Gowachin beyond the God Wall, 
the ones who’d created this hellish 
place, were slow . terrifyingly 
slow. But eventually they would be 
unable to misunderstand Jedrik’s in- 
tentions. Would they step in, those 
mentally retarded Gowachin out 
there, and try to stop Jedrik? She 
obviously thought they would. Ev- 
erything she did told Broey of the 
care with which Jedrik had prepared 
for the stupids from Outside. Broey 
almost wished her success, but he 
could not bear the price he and his 
people would have to pay. 

Jedrik had the time-edge on him. 
She had McKie. She had played 
McKie like a superb instrument. 
And what would McKie do when he 
realized the final use Jedrik in- 
tended to make of him? Yes 
. McKie was a perfect tool for 
Jedrik. She’d obviously waited for 
that perfect instrument, had known 
when it arrived. 

Gods! She was superb! 

Broey scratched at the nodes be- 

70 



tween his ventricles. Well, there 
were still things a trapped people 
could do. He returned to his com- 
manders. 

“Abandon the corridor. Do it 
quietly, but swiftly. Fall back to the 
prepared inner walls.’’ 

As his commanders started to 
turn away, Broey stopped them. 

“I also want some carefully 
selected volunteers. The fix we’re 
in must be explained to them in 
such a way that there’s no misun- 
derstanding. They will be asked to 
sacrifice themselves in a way no 
Gowachin has ever before con- 
templated.” 

“How?” 

It was the slender one. 

Broey addressed himself to this 
one. A Gowachin bom on the Rim 
should be the first to understand. 

“We must increase the price Jed- 
rik’s paying. Hundreds of their 
people for every one of ours.” 

“Suicide missions,” the slender 
one said. 

Broey nodded, continued: 

“One more thing. I want Havvy 
brought up here and I want orders 
issued to increase the food allotment 
to those Humans we’ve held in spe- 
cial reserve.” 

Two of his commanders spoke in 
unison: 

“They won’t sacri ...” 

“I have something else in mind 
for them.” 

Broey nodded to himself. Yes in- 
deed. Some of those Humans could 
still serve his purposes. It wasn’t 
likely they could serve him as 
McKie served Jedrik, but there was 
still a chance . .yes, a chance. 
Jedrik might not be certain of what 
Broey could do with his Humans. 

GALAXY 



Havvy, for example. Jedrik had cer- 
tainly considered and discarded 
Havvy. In itself, that might be use- 
ful. Broey waved for his command- 
ers to leave and execute his orders. 
They’d seen the new determination 
in him. They’d pass that along to 
the ones beneath them. That, too, 
would serve his purposes. It would 
delay the moment when his people 
might suspect that he was making a 
desperate gamble. 

He returned to his communicator, 
called his search people, urged them 
to new efforts. They might still 
achieve what Jedrik obviously had 
achieved with Pcharky ... if they 
could find a Pcharky.

McKie told himself that he 
might’ve known an assignment from 
Jedrik could not be simple. There 
had to be Dosadi complications. 

“There can be no question in 
their minds that you’re really my 
lieutenant.” 

“Then I must be your lieuten- 
ant.” 

This pleased her and she gave 
THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



him the bare outline of her plan, 
warning him that the upcoming en- 
counter could not be an act. He 
must respond as one who was fully 
aware of this planet’s demands. 

Night fell over Chu while she 
prepared him and, when they re- 
turned to the command post where 
Gar and Tria waited, the occasion 
presented itself as Jedrik had told 
him it would. It was a sortie by 
Broey’s people against Gate Eigh- 
teen. Jedrik snapped the orders at 
him, sent him running. 

“Find the purpose of that!” 

McKie paused only to pick up 
four waiting guards at the command 
post door, noting the unconcealed 
surprise in Gar and Tria. They’d 
formed a particular opinion of 
McKie ’s position and now had to 
seek a new assessment. Tria would 
be most upset by this, confused by 
self doubts. McKie knew Jedrik 
would immediately amplify those 
doubts, telling Gar and Tria that 
McKie would go with them when 
he returned from Gate Eighteen. 

“You must consider his orders as 
my orders.” 

Gate Eighteen turned out to be 
more than a minor problem. Broey 
had taken the gate itself and two 
buildings. One of the attackers, div- 
ing from an upper window into one 
of Jedrik’s best units, had blown 
himself up with a nasty lot of 
casualties. 

“More than a hundred dead,” a 
breathless courier told him. 

McKie didn’t like the implica- 
^tions of a suicide attack, but 
couldn’t pause to assess it. They 
had to eliminate this threat. He gave 
orders for two feints while a third 
force blasted down one of the cap- 



71 



tured buildings, smothering the gate 
in rubble. That left the other captive 
building isolated. The swiftness of 
this success dazzled Jedrik’s forces 
and the commanders snapped to 
obedience when McKie issued or- 
ders for them to take captives and 
bring those captives to him for in- 
terrogation. 

At McKie’s command, one of his 
original four guards brought a map 
of the area, tacked it to a wall. Less 
than an hour had passed since he’d 
left Jedrik, but McKie felt that he’d 
entered another world, one even 
more primitive than that surround- 
ing the incredible woman who’d set 
all of this in motion. It was the dif- 
ference between second- and third- 
hand reports of action and the phys- 
ical feeling of that action all around 
him. Explosions and the hissing of 
flamers down on the streets jarred 
his awareness. 

Staring at the map, McKie said: 
“This has all the marks of a trap. 
Get all but a holding force out of 
the area. Tell Jedrik.” 

People scurried to obey. 

One of the guards and two sub- 
commanders remained. The guard 
spoke. 

“What about this place?” 

McKie glanced around him. It 
was a square room with brown 
walls. Two windows looked out on 
the street away from the battle for 
the isolated building near the gate. 
He’d hardly looked at the room 
when they’d brought him here to set 
up his command post. Four streets 
with isolated holdouts cushioned 
him from the main battle. They 
could shoot a cable bridge to 
another building if things became 
hot here. And it’d help morale if he 

72 



remained in the danger area. 

He spoke to one of the sub- 
commanders: 

“Go down to the entry. Call all 
the elevators down there and disable 
all but one. Stand by that one with 
a holding force and put guards in 
the stairway. Stand by yourself to 
bring up captives. Comment?” 

“I’ll send up two cable teams 
and make sure the adjoining build- 
ings are secure.” 

Of course! McKie nodded. 

Gods! How these people reacted 
in emergencies. They were as direct 
and cutting as knives. 

“Do it,” McKie said. 

He had less than a ten minute 
wait before two of Jedrik’s special 
security troops brought up the first 
captive, a young Gowachin whose 
eyelids bore curious scars — scroll- 
like and pale against the green skin. 

The two security people stopped 
just inside the doorway. They held 
the Gowachin firmly, although he 
did not appear to be struggling. The 
sub-commander who’d brought 
them up closed the door as he left. 

One of the captors, an older man 
with narrow features, nodded as he 
caught McKie’s attention. 

“What’ll we do with him?” 

“Tie him in a chair,” McKie in- 
structed. 

He studied the Gowachin as they 
complied. 

“Where was he captured?” 

“He was trying to escape from 
that building through a perimeter 
sewage line.” 

“Alone?” 

“I don’t know. He’s the first of a 
group of prisoners. The others are 
waiting outside.” 

They had finished binding the 

GALAXY 



young Gowachin, now took up posi- 
tion directly behind him. 

McKie studied the captive. He 
wore black coveralls with charac- 
teristic deep vee to clear the ventri- 
cles. The garment had been cut and 
torn in several places. He’d ob- 
viously been searched with swift 
and brutal thoroughness. McKie put 
down a twinge of pity. The scar 
lines on the prisoner’s eyelids pre- 
cluded anything but the most direct 
Dosadi necessities. 

“They did a poor job removing 
your Phylum tatoos,” McKie said. 
He’d already recognized the scar 
lines: Deep Swimmers. It was a rel- 
atively unimportant Phylum, small 
in numbers and sensitive about their 
status. 

The young Gowachin blinked. 
McKie’s opening remark had been 
so conversational, even toned, that 
the shock of his words came after. 
Shock was obvious now in the set 
of the captive’s mouth. 

“What is your name, please?” 
McKie asked, still in that even, 
conversational way. 

“Grinik.” 

It was forced out of him. 

McKie asked one of the guards 
for a notebook and stylus, wrote the 
Gowachin ’s name in it, adding the 
Phylum indentification. 

“Grinik of the Deep Swimmers,” 
he said. “How long have you been 
on Dosadi?” 

The Gowachin took a deep, ven- 
tricular breath, remained silent. The 
security men appeared puzzled. This 
interrogation wasn’t going as they’d 
expected. 

McKie himself did not know 
what to expect. He still felt him- 
self recovering from surprise at 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



recognition of the bad-erased 
Phylum tatoos. 

“This is a very small planet,” 
McKie said. “The Universe from 
which we both come is very big and 
can be very cruel. I’m sure you 
didn’t come here expecting to die.” 

If this Grinik didn’t know the 
deadly plans of his superiors, that 
would emerge shortly. McKie’s 
words could be construed as a per- 
sonal threat beyond any larger threat 
to Dosadi as a whole. It remained 
to see how Grinik reacted. 

Still, the young Gowachin hesi- 
tated. 

When in doubt, remain silent. 

“You appear to’ve been 
adequately trained for this project,” 
McKie said. “But I doubt if you 
were told everything you should 
know. I even doubt if you were told 
things essential to you in your pres- 
ent position.” 

“Who are you?” Grinik de- 
manded. “How dare you speak here 
of matters which ...” He broke 
off, glanced at the two guards 
standing at his shoulders. 

“They know all about us,” 
McKie lied. 

He could smell the sweet perfume 
of Gowachin fear now, a floral 
scent which he’d noted only on a 
few previous occasions. The two 
guards also sensed this and showed 
faint smiles to betray that they knew 
its import. 

“Your masters sent you here to 
die,” McKie said. “They may very 
well pay heavily for this. You ask 
who I am? I am Jorj X. McKie, 
Legum of the Gowachin bar. 
Saboteur Extraordinary, senior 
lieutenant of Jedrik who will shortly 
rule all of Dosadi. I make formal 

73 



imposition upon you. Answer my 
questions for the Law is at stake. 

On the Gowachin worlds that was 
a most powerful motivator. Grinik 
was shaken by it. 

“What do you wish to know? 

He barely managed the words. 
“Your mission on Dosadi. The 
precise instructions you were given 
and who gave them to you.” 

“There are twenty of us. We 
were sent by Mrreg.” 

That name! The implications in 
Gowachin lore stunned McKie. He 
waited, then: 

“Continue.” 

“Two more of our twenty are out 
there.” 

Grinik motioned to the doorway, 
clearly pleading for his captive as- 
sociates. 

“Your instructions?” 

“To get our people out of this 
terrible place.” 

“How long?” 

“Just . sixty hours remain.” 
McKie exhaled slowly. So Aritch 
and company had given up on him. 
They were going to eliminate 
Dosadi. 

“Where are the other members of 
your party?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“You were, of course, a reserve 
team trained and held in readiness 
for this mission. Do you realize 
how poorly you were trained?” 
Grinik remained silent. 

McKie put down a feeling of de- 
spair, glanced at the two guards. He 
understood that they’d brought him 
this particular captive because this 
was one of three who were not 
Dosadi. Jedrik had instructed them, 
of course. Many things became 
clearer to him in this new aware- 

74 



ness. Jedrik had put sufficient pres- 
sure on the Gowachin beyond the 
God Wall. She still had not imag- 
ined the extremes to which those 
Gowachin might go in stopping her. 

It was time Jedrik learned what sort 
of fuse she’d lighted. And Broey 
must be told. Especially Broey 
. before he sent many more 
suicide missions. 

The outer door opened and the 
sub-commander leaned in to speak. 

“You were right about the trap. 
We mined the area before pulling 
back. Caught them nicely. The 
gate’s secure now and we’ve 
cleared out that last building.” 

McKie pursed his lips, then: 

“Take the prisoners to Jedrik. 
Tell her we’re coming in.” 

A flicker of surprise touched the 
sub-commander’s eyes. 

“She knows.” 

Still the man hesitated. 

“Yes?” 

“There’s one Human prisoner out 
here you should question before 
leaving.” 

McKie waited. Jedrik knew he 
was coming in, knew what had 
gone on here, knew about the 
Human prisoner out there. She 
wanted him to question this person. 
Yes ... of course. She left nothing 
to chance ... by her standards. 
Well, her standards were about to 
change but she might even know 
that. 

“Name?” 

“Havw. Broey holds him but he 
once served Jedrik. She says to tell 
you Havvy is a reject, that he was 
contaminated.’’ 

“Bring him in.” 

Havvy surprised him. The surface 
was that of a bland-faced nonentity, 

GALAXY 



braggadocio clearly evident under a 
mask of secret knowledge. He wore 
a green uniform with a driver’s 
brassard. The uniform was wrinkled 
but there were no visible rips or 
cuts. He’d been treated with more 
care than the Gowachin who was 
being led out of the room. Havvy 
replaced the Gowachin in the chair. 
McKie waved away the bindings. 

Unfocused questions created tur- 
moil in McKie’s mind. He found it 
difficult to delay. Sixty hours! But 
he felt that he could almost touch 
the solution to the Dosadi mystery, 
that in only a few minutes he would 
know names and real motives for 
the ones who’d created this mon- 
ster. Havvy? He’d served Jedrik. In 
what way? Why rejected? Contami- 
nated? 

Unfocused questions, yes. 

Havvy sat in watchful tension, 
casting an occasional glance around 
the room, at the windows. There 
were no more explosions out there. 

As McKie studied him more care- 
fully, certain observations emerged. 
Havvy was small but solid, one of 
those Humans of lesser stature who 
concealed heavy musculature which 
could surprise you if you suddenly 
bumped into them. It was difficult 
to guess his age, but he was not 
Dosadi. A member of Grinik’s 
team? Doubtful. Clearly not Dosadi, 
though. He didn’t examine those 
around him with an automatic status 
assessment. His reactions were 
slow. Too much that should remain 
under shutters flowed from within 
him directly to the surface. Yes, 
that was the ultimate revelation. It 
bothered McKie that so much went 
-on unseen beneath the surface here, 
so much for which Aritch and com- 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



pany had not prepared him. It 
would take a lifetime to learn all the 
nuances of this place and he had 
less than sixty hours remaining to 
him. 

All of this flowed through 
McKie’s mind in an eyeblink. He 
reached his decision, motioned the 
guards and others to leave. 

One of the security people started 
to protest but McKie silenced him 
with a glance, pulled up a chair and 
sat down facing the captive. 

The door closed behind the last 
of the guards. 

“You were sent here deliberately 
to seek me out,” McKie said. 

It was not the opening Havvy had 
expected. He stared into McKie’s 
eyes. A door slammed outside. 
There was the sound of several 
doors opening and shutting, the 
shuffling of feet. An amplified 
voice called out: 

“Move these prisoners out!” 

Havvy chewed at his upper lip. 
He didn’t protest. A deep sigh 
shook him, then: 

“You’re Jorj X. McKie of 
BuSab?” 

McKie blew out through pursed 
lips. Did Havvy doubt the evidence 
of his own senses? Surprising. 
McKie shook his head, continued to 
study the captive. 

“You can’t be McKie!” Havvy 
said. 

“Ahhhhhh . .” It was pressed 
out of McKie. 

Something about Havvy: the body 
moved, the voice spoke, but the 
eyes did not agree. 

McKie th'ought about what the 
Caleban, Fannie Mae, had said. A 
light touch. He was overtaken by an 
abrupt certainty: someone other than 

75 



Havvy looked out through the 
man’s eyes. Yessss. Aritch’s people 
controlled the Caleban who main- 
tained the barrier around Dosadi. 
That Caleban could contact selected 
people here. She’d have a constant 
updating on everything such people 
learned. There must be many such 
spies on Dosadi, all trained not to 
betray the Caleban contact — no 
twitching, no lapses into trance. No 
telling how many agents Aritch pos- 
sessed here. 

Would all the other people on 
Dosadi remain unaware of such a 
thing, though? That was a matter to 
question . 

“But you must be McKie,’’ 
Havvy said. “Jedrik’s still working 
out of ...” He broke off. 

“You must’ve provided her with 
some amusement by your bum- 
bling,” McKie said. “I assure you, 
however, that BuSab is not 
amused.” 

A gloating look came over 
Havvy’ s face. 

“No, she hasn’t made the trans- 
fer yet.” 

“Transfer?” 

“Haven’t you figured out yet 
how Pcharky’s supposed to buy his 
freedom?” 

McKie felt off balance at this odd 
turn. 

“Explain.” 

“He’s supposed to transfer your 
identity into Jedrik’s body and her 
identity into your body. I think she 
was going to try that with me once, 
but . .” 

Havvy shrugged. 

It was like an explosion in 
McKie’s newly sensitized aware- 
ness. Rejected! Contaminated! Body 
exchange! McKie was accusatory! 

76 



“Broey sent you!” 

“Of course.” Offensive. 

McKie contained his anger. The 
Dosadi complexities no longer baf- 
fled him as once they had. It was 
like peeling back layer upon layer 
of concealment. With each new 
layer you expected to find the an- 
swer. But that was a trap the whole 
universe set for the unwary. It was 
the ultimate mystery and he hated 
mystery. There were those who said 
this was a necessary ingredient for 
BuSab agents. You eliminated that 
which you hated. But everything 
he’d uncovered about this planet 
showed him how little he’d known 
previously about any mystery. Now, 
he understood something new about 
Jedrik. There was little doubt that 
Broey’s Human messenger told the 
truth. Pcharky had penetrated the in- 
tricacies of PanSpechi ego transfer. 
He’d done it without a PanSpechi as 
his subject, unless. Yes . that 
expanded the implications in Tria’s 
history. 

Their PanSpechi experiment 
had assumed even more grotesque 
proportions. 

“I will speak directly to your 
Caleban monitor,” McKie said. 

“My what?” 

It was such obvious dissimulation 
that McKie only snorted. He leaned 
forward. 

“I will speak directly to Aritch. 
See that he gets this message with- 
out any mistakes.” 

Havvy’s eyes became glassy. He 
shuddered. 

McKie felt the inner tendrils of 
an attempted Caleban contact in his 
own awareness, thrust them aside. 

“No! I will speak openly through 
your agent. Pay close attention, 

GALAXY 



Aritch. Those who created this 
Dosadi horror cannot run far 
enough, fast enough or long enough 
to escape. If you wish to make 
every Gowachin in the universe a 
target for violence, you are proceed- 
ing correctly. Others, including 
BuSab, can employ mass violence if 
you force it upon them. Not' a 
pleasant thought. But unless you 
adhere to your own Law, to the 
honored relationship between 
Legum and Client, your shame will 
be exposed. Innocent Gowachin as 
well as you others whose legal 
status has yet to be determined — all 
will pay the bloody price.” 

Havvy’s brows drew down in 
puzzlement. 

“Shame?” 

“They plan to blast Dosadi out of 
existence.” 

Havvy pressed back into the 
chair, glared at McKie. 

“You’re lying.” 

“Even you, Havvy, are capable 
of recognizing a truth. I’m going to 
release you, pass you back through 
the lines to Broey. Tell him what 
you learned from me.” 

“It’s a lie! They’re not going 
to . .” 

“Ask Aritch for yourself.” 

Havvy didn’t ask “Aritch who?” 
He lifted himself from the chair. 

“I will.” 

“Tell Broey we’ve less than sixty 
hours. None of us who can resist 
mind erasure will be permitted to 
escape.” 

“Us?” 

McKie nodded, thinking; yes, / 
am Dosadi now. He said: 

“Get out of here.” 

It afforded him a measure of 
amusement that the door was

opened by the sub-commandef just 
as Havvy reached it. 

“See to him yourself,’’ McKie 
said, indicating Havvy. “I’ll be 
ready to go in a moment.’’ 

Without any concern about 
whether the sub-commander under- 
stood the nature of the assignment, 
McKie closed his eyes in thought. 
There remained the matter of Mrreg 
who’d sent twenty Gowachin from 
Tandaloor to get his people off the 
planet. Mrreg. That was the name 
of the mythical monster who’d 
tested the first primitive Gowachin 
people almost to extinction, setting 
the pattern of their deepest instincts. 

Mrreg? 

Was it code or did some 
Gowachin actually use that name? 
Or was it a role that some 
Gowachin filled?

When the means of great violence are

retaliation in kind. 

— BuSab Manual 



Less than an hour after closing 
down at Gate Eighteen, McKie and 
his escort arrived back at Jedrik’s 
headquarters building. He led them 
to the heavily guarded side entrance 
with its express elevator, not want- 
ing to pass Pcharky at this moment. 
Pcharky was an unnecessary distrac- 
tion. He left the escort in the hall- 
way with instructions to get food 
and rest, signalled for the elevator. 

78 



The elevator door was opened by 
a small Human female of about fif- 
teen years who nodded him into the 
dim interior. 

McKie, his natural distrust of 
even the young on this planet well 
masked, nevertheless kept her under 
observation as he accepted the invi- 
tation. She was a gamin child with 
dirty face and hands, a torn grey 
single garment cut off at the knees. 
Her very existence as a Dosadi sur- 
vivor said she’d undoubtedly sold 
her body many times for scraps of 
food. He realized how much Dosadi 
had influenced him when he found 
that he couldn’t raise even the 
slightest feeling of censure at this 
knowledge. You did what the condi- 
tions around you demanded when 
those conditions were overwhelm- 
ing. It was an ultimate question: 
this or death? And certainly some 
of them chose death. 

“Jedrik,’’ he said. 

She worked her controls and he 
found himself presently in an un- 
familiar hallway. Two familiar 
guards stood at a doorway down the 
hall, however. They betrayed not 
the slightest interest in him as he 
opened the door between them 
swiftly and strode through. 

It was a tiny anteroom, empty, 
but another door directly in front of 
him. He opened this with more con- 
fidence than he felt, entered a larger 
space full of projection-room gloom 
with shadowed figures seated facing 
a holographic focus on his left. 
McKie identified Jedrik by her pro- 
file, slipped into a seat beside her. 

She kept her attention on the 
h-focus where a projection of Broey 
stood looking out at something over 
their shoulders. McKie recognized 

GALAXY 



the subtle slippage of computer 
simulation. That was not a flesh- 
and-blood Broey in the focus. 

Someone on the far side of the 
room stood up and crossed to sit 
beside another figure in the gloom. 
McKie recognized Gar as the man 
moved through one of the projection 
beams. 

McKie whispered to Jedrik: 
“Why simulation?’’ 

“He’s beginning to do things I 
didn’t anticipate.’’ 

The suicide missions. McKie 
looked at the simulation, wondered 
why there was no sync-sound. 
Ahhh, yes. They were lip reading 
and it was silent to reduce distrac- 
tions, to amplify concentration. 
Yes, Jedrik was reworking the 
simulation model of Broey which 
she carried in her head. She would 
also carry another model, even 
more accurate than the one of 
Broey, which would give her a cer- 
tain lead time on the reactions of 
one Jorj X. McKie. 

“Would you really have done 
it?” he asked. 

“Why do you distract me with 
such nonsense?” 

He considered. Yes, it was a 
good question. He already knew the 
answer. She would have done it: 
traded bodies with him and escaped 
outside the God Wall as McKie. 
She might still do it unless he could 
anticipate the mechanics of the 
transfer. 

By now she knew about the 
sixty-hour limit and would suspect 
its significance. Less than sixty 
hours. And the Dosadi could make 
extremely complex projections from 
limited data. Witness this Broey 
simulation. 



The figure in the focus was talk- 
ing to a fat Human female who held 
a tube which McKie recognized as a 
communicator for field use. 

Jedrik spoke across the room to 
Gar. 

“She still with him?” 

“Addicted.” 

A two-sentence exchange and it 
condensed an entire conversation 
about possible uses of that woman. 
McKie did not ask addicted to 
what. There were too many such 
substances on Dosadi, each with 
peculiar characteristics, often in- 
volving odd monopolies with which 
everyone seemed familiar. 

This was a telltale gap in Aritch’s 
briefings: the monopolies and their 
uses. 

As McKie absorbed the action in 
the focus, the reasons behind this 
session became more apparent. 
Broey was refusing to believe the 
report from Havvy. 

And there was Havvy in the 
focus. 

Jedrik favored McKie with one 
flickering glance as Havvy- 
simulation appeared. Certainly. She 
factored McKie into her computa- 
tions. 

McKie compressed his lips. She 
knew Havvy would contaminate 
me. They couldn’t say “I love 
you” on this damned planet. Oh, 
no. They had to create a special 
Dosadi production number. 

Most of the data for this origi- 
nated before the breakup,” McKie 
said. “It’s useless. Rather than ask 
the computer to play pretty pictures 
for us, why don’t we examine our 
own memories? Surely, somewhere 
in the combined experiences with 
Broey . .” 



IHE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



79 



A chuckle somewhere to the left 
stopped him. 

Too late, McKie saw that every 
seat in the room had an arm keyed 
to the simulations. They were doing 
precisely what he’d suggested, but 
in a more sophisticated way. The 
figures at the focus were being ad- 
justed to the combined memories. 
There was such a keyed arm at 
McKie’s right hand. He suddenly 
realized how tactless and lecturing 
he still must appear to these people. 
They didn’t waste energy on un- 
necessary words. Anyone who did 
must be subnormal, poorly trained 
or ... or not from Dosadi. 

“Does he always state the obvi- 
ous?’’ Gar asked. 

McKie wondered if he’d blown 
his lieutenancy, lost the opportunity 
to explore the mystery of the Rim, 
but . no, there wasn’t time for 
that now. He’d have to penetrate 
the Rim another way. 

“He’s new,’’ Jedrik said. “New 
is not necessarily naive, as yoff 
should know.” 

“He has you doing it now,” Gar 
said. 

“Guess again.” 

McKie put a hand to the simula- 
tion controls under his right hand, 
tested the keys. He had it in a mo- 
ment. They were similar to such 
devices in the ConSentiency, an 
adaptation from the DemoPol in- 
puts, no doubt. Slowly, he changed 
the Broey at the focus, heavier, the 
sagging jowls and node wattles of a 
breeding male Gowachin. McKie 
froze the image. 

“Tentative?” Gar asked. 

Jedrik answered for him. 

“It’s knowledge he brought here 
with him.” She did something to 

80 



her controls, stopped the projection 
and raised the room lights. 

McKie noted that Tria was 
nowhere in the room. 

“The Gowachin have sequestered 
their females somewhere,” McKie 
said. “That somewhere should not 
be difficult to locate. Send word to 
Tria that she must not mount her at- 
tack on Broey ’s corridor just yet.” 
“Why delay?” Gar demanded. 
“Broey will have all but 
evacuated the corridor by now,” 
McKie said. 

Gar was angry and showing it. 
“Not a single one of them has 
gone through that Rim gate.” 

“Not to the Rim,” Jedrik said. 

It was clear to her now. McKie 
had supplied the leverage she 
needed. It was time now to employ 
him as she’d always intended. She 
glanced at McKie. 

“We have unfinished business. 
Are you ready?” 

He held his silence. How could 
he answer such a Dosadi-weighted 
question? There were so many 
things left unspoken on this planet, 
only the native-born could under- 
stand them all. McKie felt once 
more that he was a dull outsider, a 
child of dubious potential among 
normal adults. 

Jedrik arose, looked across at 
Gar. 

“Send word to Tria to hold her- 
self in readiness for another assign- 
ment. Tell Broey. Call him on an 
open line. We now have an excel- 
lent use for your fanatics. If only a 
few of your people fight through to 
that graluz complex it’ll be enough 
and Broey will know it.” 

McKie noted that she spoke to 
Gar with a familiar teaching 'em- 

GALAXY 



phasis. It was the curiously weight- 
ed manner she’d once used with 
McKie but no longer found neces- 
sary. His recognition of this amused 
her. 

“Come along, McKie. We 
haven’t much time.” 

★ ★ ★ 

The attack by those who want to 
die — this is the attack against which 
you cannot prepare a perf^t defense. 

— Human aphorism 



For almost an hour after the 
morning meal, Aritch observed 
Ceylang as she worked with the 
McKie simulator. She was pushing 
herself hard, believing Wreave 
honor at stake, and had almost 
reached the pitch Aritch desired. 

Ceylang had set up her own 
simulator situation: McKie inter- 
viewing five of Broey’s Gowachin. 
She had the Gowachin come to 
McKie in surrender, hands ex- 
tended, the webbed fingers exposed 
to show that the talons were with- 
drawn. 

Simulator-McKie merely probed 
for military adv^tages. 

“Why does Broey attack in this 
fashion?’ ’ 

Or he’d turn to some place out- 
side the h-focus of the simulator. 

“Send reinforcements into that 
area.” 

Nothing about the Rim. 

Earlier, Ceylang had tried the 
issue with a prisoner simulation 
where the five Gowachin tried to 
confuse McKie by presenting a 
scenario in which Broey massed his 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



forces at the corridor. The makings 
of a breakout to the Rim appeared 
obvious. 

Simulator-McKie asked the pris- 
oners why they lied. 

Ceylang cleared the simulator. 
She saw Aritch at the observation 
window, opened a channel to him. 

“Something has to be wrong in 
the simulation. McKie cannot be led 
into questioning the purposes of the 
Rim.” 

“I assure you that simulation is 
remarkable in its accuracy. Remark- 
able.” 

“Then why . .” 

“Perhaps he already knows the 
answer. Why don’t you try him 
with Jedrik? Here ...” Aritch op- 
erated the controls at the observer 
station. “This might help. This is a 
record of McKie in recent action on 
Dosadi.” 

The simulator presented a view 
down a covered passage through a 
building. Artificial light. Darkness 
at the far end of the passage. 
McKie, two blocky guards in tow, 
approached the viewers. 

Ceylang recognized the scene. 
She’d watched this action at Gate 
Eighteen from several angles, had 
seen this passage empty before the 
battle, acquainting herself with the 
available views. As she’d watched 
it then, the passage had filled with 
Human defenders. There was a 
minor gate behind the viewer and 
she knew the viewer itself to be 
only a bright spot, a fleck of glitter- 
ing impurity in an otherwise drab 
brick over the gate’s archway. 

Now, the long passage seemed 
strange to Ceylang without its 
throng of defenders. There were 
only a few workmen along its 



81 



length as McKie passed. The 
workmen repaired service pipes in 
the ceiling. A cleanup crew washed 
down patches of blood at the far 
end of the passage, the high water 
mark of the Gowachin attack. An 
officer leaned against a wall near 
the viewer, a bored expression on 
his face which did not mislead 
Ceylang. He was there to watch 
McKie. Three soldiers squatted 
nearby rolling hexi-bones for coins 
which lay in piles before each man. 
Every now and then, one of the 
gamblers would pass a coin to the 
watching officer. A repair super- 
visor stood with his back to the 
viewer, notebook in hand, writing a 
list of supplies to Complete the job. 
McKie and his guards were forced 
to step around these people. As they 
passed, the officer turned, looked 
directly into the viewer, smiled. 

“That officer,’’ Ceylang said. 
“One of your people?’’ 

“No.” 

The viewpoint shifted, looking 
down on the gate itself, McKie in 
profile. The gatekeeper was a teen- 
ager with a scar down his right 
cheek and a broken nose. McKie 
showed no signs of recognition, but 
the youth knew McKie. 

“You go through on request.” 
“When did she call?” 

“Ten.” 

“Let us through.” 

The gate was opened. McKie and 
his guards went through, passed be- 
yond the viewer’s focus. 

The youthful gatekeeper stood 
up, smashed the viewer. The 
h-focus went blank. 

Aritch looked down from his ob- 
servation booth for a moment before 
speaking. 

82 



“Who called?” 

“Jedrik?” Ceylang spoke without 
thinking. 

“What does that conversation tell 
you? Quickly!” 

“That Jedrik anticipated his 
movements, was observing him all 
the time.” 

“What else?” 

“That McKie . knows this, 
knows she can anticipate him.” 

“She carries a better simulation 
of him in her head than we 
have . there.” 

Aritch pointed at the h-focus 
area. 

“But they left so much unspo- 
ken!” Ceylang said. 

Aritch remained silent. 

Ceylang sat back and closed her 
eyes. It was like mind reading. It 
confused her. 

Aritch interrupted her musings. 
“What about that officer and the 
gatekeeper?” 

She shook her head. 

“You’re wise to use living ob- 
servers there. They all seem to 
know when they’re being watched. 
And how it’s done.” 

“Even McKie.” 

“He didn’t look at the viewers.” 
“Because he assumed from the 
first that we’d have him under al- 
most constant observation. He’s not 
concerned about the mechanical in- 
trusions. He has built a simulation 
McKie of his own who acts on the 
surface of the real McKie.” 

“That’s your assumption?” 

“We arrived at this from observa- 
tion of Jedrik in her dealings with 
McKie. She peels away the simula- 
tion layers one at a time, coming 
closer and closer to the actuality at 
the core.” 



GALAXY 



Another observation bothered 
Ceylang. 

“Why’d the gatekeeper shut 
down that viewer Just then?” 

“Obviously because Jedrik told 
him to do that.” 

Ceylang shuddered. 

“Sometimes I think those Dosadi 
play us like a fine instrument.” 

“But of course! That’s why we 
sent them our McKie.” 

★ ★ ★ 

The more control the more that re- 
quires control. This is the road to 
chaos. 

— PanSpechi aphorism 



It was a half hour before Jedrik 
and McKie found themselves in the 
hallway leading to her quarters. 
McKie, aware of the effort she was 
expending to conceal a deep weari- 
ness, watched her carefully. She 
concentrated on presenting a show 
of vitality, her attention glued on 
the prospect ahead. There was no 
way of telling what went on in her 
mind. McKie did not attempt to 
break the silence. He had his own 
worries. 

Which was the real Jedrik? How 
was she going to employ Pcharky? 
Could he resist her? 

He knew he was close to a solu- 
tion of the Dosadi mystery, but the 
prospect of the twin gambles he was 
about to take filled him with 
doubts. 

On coming from the projection 
room, they’d found themselves in a 
strange delaying situation, as though 
it were something planned for their 

THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



frustration. Everything had been 
prepared for their movement — 
guards warned, elevator waiting, 
doors opened. But every time they 
thought the way clear they met in- 
terference. Except for the obvious 
importance of the matters which de- 
layed them, it was easy to imagine 
a conspiracy. 

A party of Gowachin at Gate 
Seventy wanted to surrender but 
they demanded a parley first. One 
of Jedrik’s aides didn’t like the situ- 
ation. Something about the assess- 
ment of the offer bothered her and 
she wanted to discuss it with Jedrik. 
She stopped them halfway down the 
first hall outside the projection 
room. 

The aide was an older woman 
who reminded McKie vaguely of a 
Wreave lab worker at BuSab, one 
who’d always been suspicious of 
computers, even antagonistic toward 
them. This Wreave had read every 
bit of history he could find about 
the evolution of such instruments 
and liked to remind his listeners of 
the misuses of the DemoPol. 
Human history had provided him 
with abundant ammunition, what 
with its periodic revolts against 
“enslavement by machines.” Once, 
he’d cornered McKie. 

“Look here! See this sign: 
‘Gigo.’ That’s a very old sign that 
was hung above one of your ancient 
computers. It’s an acronym: ‘Gar- 
bage In, Garbage Out.’ You see! 
They knew.” 

Yes. Jedrik’s female aide re- 
minded him of that Wreave. 

McKie listened to her worries. 
She roamed all around a central 
disquiet, never settling on a particu- 
lar thing. Aware of Aritch’s dead- 



83 



line and Jedrik’s fatigue, McKie felt 
the pressures bearing down upon 
him. 

The aide’s data was accurate. 
Others had checked it. Finally, he 
could hold his impatience no 
longer. 

“Who fed this data into your 
computer?’ ’ 

The aide was startled at the inter- 
ruption, but Jedrik turned to him, 
waiting. 

“I think it was Holjance,’’ the 
aide said. “Why?” 

“Get him in here.” 

“Her.” 

“Her, then! Make sure she’s ac- 
tually the one who fed in that 
data.” 

Holjance was a pinch-faced 
woman with deep wrinkles around 
very bright eyes. Her hair was dark 
and' wiry, skin almost the color of 
McKie’s. 

Yes, she was the one who’d fed 
the data into the computer because it 
had arrived on her shift and she’d 
thought it too important to delegate. 

“What is it you want?” she de- 
manded. 

He did not see any rudeness in 
this. It was Dosadi directness. Im- 
portant things were happening all 
around. 

Don’t waste time. 

“You saw this assessment of the 
surrender offer?” he asked. 

“Yes.” 

“Are you satisfied with it?” 

“The data went in correctly.” 
“That’s my question.” 

“Of course I’m satisfied!” 

She stood ready to defend herself 
against any charge that she’d 
slighted her job. 

“Tell me, Holjance,” he said, 

84 



“if you wanted the Gowachin com- 
puters to produce inaccurate as- 
sessments, what would you do?” 

She thought about this a moment, 
blinked, glanced almost furtively at 
Jedrik who appeared lost in thought. 
“Well, sir, we have a regular filter- 
ing procedure for preventing ...” 
“That’s it,” Jedrik said. “If I 
were a Gowachin, I would not be 
doing that right now.” 

Jedrik turned, barked orders to 
the guards behind her. 

“That’s another trap! Take care 
of it.” 

As they emerged from the 
elevator on Jedrik’s floor there was 
another delay, one of the escort 
who’d been with McKie at Gate 
Eighteen. His name was Todu Pel- 
las and McKie addressed him by 
name, noting the faint betrayal of 
pleasure this elicited. Pellas, too, 
had doubts about carrying out a par- 
ticular order. 

“We’re supposed to back up 
Tria’s move by attacking across the 
upper parkway, but there are some 
trees and other growth knocked 
down up here that haven’t been 
moved for two days.” 

“Who knocked down those 
trees?” McKie asked. 

“We did.” 

McKie understood. “Youfeinted.” 
The Gowachin were supposed to be- 
lieve this would provide cover for 
an attack but there ’d been no attack 
for two days. 

“They must be under pretty 
heavy strain,” Jedrik said. 

McKie nodded. That, too, made 
sense. The alternative Gowachin as- 
sumption was that the Humans were 
trying to fake them into an attack at 
that point. But the cover had not 

GALAXY 



been removed by either side for two 
days. 

Jedrik took a deep breath. 

“We have superior firepower and 
when Tria . .well, you should be 
able to cut right through there 
to . .” 

McKie interrupted. 

“Call off that attack.” 

“But . .” 

“Call it off!” 

She saw the direction of his 
reasoning. Broey had learned much 
from the force which Gar and Tria 
had trained. And Jedrik herself had 
provided the final emphasis in the 
lesson. She saw there was no need 
to change her orders to Pallas. 

Pallas had taken it upon himself 
to obey McKie, not waiting for Jed- 
rik’s response, although she was his 
commander. He already had a 
communicator off his belt and was 
speaking rapidly into it. 

“Yes! Dig in for a holding ac- 
tion.” 

He spoke in an aside to Jedrik. 

“I can handle it from here.” 

In a few steps, Jedrik and McKie 
found themselves in her room. Jed- 
rik leaned with her back against the 
door, no longer trying to conceal 
her fatigue. 

“McKie, you’re becoming very 
Dosadi.” 

He crossed to the concealing 
panels, pulled out the bed. 

“You need rest.” 

“No time.” 

Yes, she knew all about the 
sixty-hour deadline . less than 
fifty-five hours now. Dosadi ’s de- 
struction was a reaction she hadn’t 
expected from ‘X’ and she blamed 
herself. 

He turned, studied her, saw that 
THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



she’d passed some previously de- 
fined limit of personal endurance. 
She possessed no amplifiers of 
muscles or senses, none of the 
sophisticated aids McKie could call 
upon in emergencies. She had noth- 
ing but her own magnificent mind 
and body. And she’d almost run 
them out. Still she pressed on. This 
told him a great deal about her 
motivation. 

McKie found himself deeply 
touched by the fact that she’d not 
once berated him for hiding that ul- 
timate threat which Aritch held over 
Dosadi. She’d accepted it that 
someone in Aritch’s position could 
erase an entire planet, that McKie 
had been properly maneuvered into 
concealing this. 

The alternative she offered filled 
McKie with misgivings. 

Exchange bodies? 

He understood now that this was 
Pcharky’s function, the price the old 
Gowachin paid for survival. Jedrik 
had explained. 

“He will perform this service one 
more time. In exchange, we release 
him from Dosadi.” 

“If he’s one of the original ... I 
mean, why doesn’t he just leave?” 

“We haven’t provided him with a 
body he can use.” 

McKie had suppressed a feeling 
of horror. But the history of Dosadi 
which Jedrik unfolded made it clear 
that a deliberate loophole had been 
left in the Caleban contract which 
imprisoned this planet. Fannie Mae 
had even said it. He could leave in 
another body. That was the basic 
purpose behind this experiment. 

New bodies for old! 

Aritch had expected this to be the 
ultimate enticement, luring McKie 



85 



into the Gowachin plot, enlisting 
McKie’s supreme abilities and his 
powerful position in BuSab. 

A new body for his old one. 

All he’d have to do would be to 
cooperate in the destruction of a 
planet, conceal the real purpose of 
this project and help set up another 
body-trade planet better concealed. 

But Aritch had not anticipated 
what might be created by Jedrik 
plus McKie. They now shared a 
particular hate and motivation. 

Jedrik still stood at the door wait- 
ing for him to decide. 

“Tell me what to do,” he said. 

“You’re sure that you’re willing 
to . .” 

“Jedrik!” 

He thought he saw the beginning 
of tears. It wasn’t that she hid 
them, but that they reached a sup- 
pression level barely visible and she 
defied them. She found her voice, 
pointed. 

“That panel beside the bed. Pres- 
sure latch.” 

The panel swung wide to reveal 
two shimmering rods about two cen- 
timeters in diameter. The rods 
danced with the energies of 
Pcharky’s cage. They emerged from 
the floor, bent at right angles about 
waist height and, as the panel 
opened, they rotated to extend into 
the room — two glowing handles 
about a meter apart. 

McKie stared at them. He felt a 
tightness in his breast. What if he’d 
misread Jedrik? Could he be sure of 
any Dosadi? This room felt as 
familiar to him now as his quarters 
on CC. It was here that Jedrik had 
taught him some of the most essen- 
tial Dosadi lessons. Yet . .he 
knew the old pattern of what she 



proposed. The discarded body with 
its donor ego had always been 
killed immediately. Why? 

“You’ll have your answer to that 
question when we’re done.” 

A Dosadi response, ambiguous, 
heavy with alternatives. 

He glanced around the room, 
found it hard to believe that he’d 
known this place only these few 
days. His attention returned to the 
shimmering rods. Another trap? 

He knew he was wasting precious 
time, that he’d have to go through 
with this. But what would it be like 
to find himself in Jedrik’s flesh, 
wearing her body as he now wore 
his own? PanSpechi transferred an 
ego from body to body. But some- 
thing unspeakable which they would 
not reveal happened to the donor. 

McKie took a trembling breath. 

It had to be done. He and Jedrik 
shared a common purpose. She’d 
had many opportunities to use 
Pcharky simply to escape. The fact 
that she’d waited for a McKie 
forced him to believe her. Jedrik’s 
followers trusted her . and they 
were Dosadi. And if he and Jedrik 
escaped, Aritch would find himself 
facing a far different McKie from 
the one who’d come so innocently 
across the Rim. They might yet stay 
Aritch ’s hand. 

The enticement had been real, 
though. No doubting that. Shed an 
old body, get a new one. And the 
Rim had been the major source of 
raw material . strong, resilient 
bodies. Survivors. 

“What do I do?” he asked. 

He felt a hand on his shoulder 
and she spoke from beside him. 

“You are very Dosadi, McKie. 
Astonishing.” 



86 



GALAXY 



He glanced at her, saw what it 
had cost her to move here from the 
door. He slipped a hand around her 
waist, eased her to a sitting position 
on the bed and within reach of the 
rods. 

“Tell me what to do.” 

She stared at the rods and McKie 
realized it was rage driving her, 
rage against Aritch, the embodiment 
of ‘X,’ the embodiment of a con- 
trived fate. He understood this. The 
solution of the Dosadi mystery had 
left him feeling empty, but on the 
edges there was such a rage as he’d 
never before experienced. 

He was still BuSab, though. He 
wanted no more bloodshed because 
of Dosadi, no more Gowachin justi- 
fications. 

Jedrik’s voice interrupted his 
thoughts and he saw that she also 
shared some of his misgivings. 

‘ T come from a long line of here- 
tics. None of us doubted that 
Dosadi was a crime, that some- 
where there was a justice to punish 
the criminals.” 

McKie almost sighed. Not the old 
Messiah dream! Not that! He would 
not fill the role even for Dosadi. 

It was as though Jedrik read his 
mind. Perhaps, with that simulation 
model of him she carried in her 
head, this was exactly what she did. 

“We didn’t expect a hero to 
come and save us. We knew that 
whoever came would suffer from 
the same deficiencies as the other 
non-Dosadi we saw here. You were 
so . slow. Tell me, McKie, what 
drives a Dosadi?” 

He almost said, “Power.” 

She saw his hesitation, waited. 

“The power to change your con- 
dition,” he said. 



“You make me very proud, 
McKie.” 

“But how did you know 1 
was ...” 

“McKie!” 

He swallowed, then: “Yes, I 
guess that was the easiest part for 
you.” 

“It was much more difficult find- 
ing your abilities and shaping you 
into a Dosadi.” 

“But I might’ve been ...” 

“Tell me how I did it, McKie.” 

It was a test. He saw that. How 
had she known absolutely that he 
was the one she needed? 

“I was sent here in a way that 
evaded Broey.” 

“And that’s not easy.’’ Her 
glance flickered ceilingward. “They 
tried to bait us from time to time. 
Havvy ...” 

“Compromised, contami- 
nated ...” 

“Useless. Sometimes, a stranger 
looks out of Havvy ’s eyes.” 

“My eyes are my own.” 

“The first thing Bahrank reported 
about you.” 

“But even before that ...” 
“Yes?” 

“They used Havvy to tell you I 
was coming . and . and he 
told you that you could use my 
body. He had to be truthful with 
you up to a point. You could read 
Havvy! How clever they thought 
they were being! I had to be vulner- 
able . .really vulnerable.” 

“The first thing ...” 

“. you found out about me.” 
He nodded. “Suspicions confirmed. 
All of that money on my person. 
Bait. I was someone to be elimi- 
nated. I was a powerful enemy of 
your enemies.” 



THE DOSADI EXPERIMENT 



87 



“And you were angered by the 
right things.” 

“You saw that?” 

“McKie, you people are so easy 
to read. So easy!" 

“And the weapons I carried. You 
were supposed to use those to de- 
stroy yourselves. The implica- 
tions ...” 

“I would’ve seen that if I’d had 
first-hand experience of Aritch. You 
knew what he intended for us. My 
mistake was to read your fears as 
purely personal. In time ...” 
“We’re wasting time.” 

“You fear we’ll be too late?” 
Once more, he looked at the 
shimmering rods. What was it 
Pcharky did? McKie felt events 

88 



rushing over him, engulfing him. 
What bargain had Jedrik really 
driven with Pcharky? She saw the 
question on his face. 

“My people knew all along that 
Pcharky was just a tool of the God 
who held us prisoner. We forced a 
bargain on that God . that Cale- 
ban. Did you think we would not 
recognize the identity between the 
powers of that cage and the powers 
of our God Wall? No more delays, 
McKie. It’s time to test our bar- 
gain.”

A FEW THINGS to get Straight be- 
fore we get rolling this month. 
Feedback on your feedback, mostly. 
(“Ah yes,’’ said my neighbor 
Homer, as he carried feed to his 
horses. “You get your feed- 
back . .’’he grimaced down at his 
shoes, “. and I get my feed 
back. I wonder which of us is better 
off?’’) 

I Didn’t Know It Was Loaded 
Dept.: dropping hints about books 
you’d like to see is a bush-league 
stunt, as I should have realized. 
Please do not mail me any more 
books unless you query first. I’m 
truly grateful to all of you who 
did — it’s nice to know you care — 
but now I have four copies of The 



90 



GALAXY 



Company of Glory and like that, 
and I’m running out of friends to 
pass them on to. If there is some 
book you love so much you just 
have to try and get me to review 
it — again, query first. The odds are 
excellent that I already have it and 
didn’t feel like reading it: you’ll 
only make me guilty. Under no cir- 
cumstances mail me anything you 
want returned, because I’m quite 
likely to lose your cover letter at 
once (this office looks like a letter- 
bombed embassy, and my two- 
year-old is a pack rat). That re- 
minds me — even if I do somehow 
keep your name and address with 
the book I can no longer thank you 
in print: I’m starting to get hand- 
written letters with the signature 
typed out, and I will not trade 
notoriety for books. 

Why Don’t You Review — ? 
Dept.: I get over a hundred books a 
month, on the average, and treat 
’em just the way you treat your 
bookstore’s sf section: I read what 
looks interesting to me. If enough 
people vigorously recommend a 
book I’ll take a crack at it (as hap- 
pened last month with Crowley’s 
The Deep) but like your bookstore, 

I can’t take individual requests. 

Will You Please Comment On 
This Original Manuscript? Dept.: 
No. Nor will I pay return 
postage — and American stamps are 
no use to me. I am involved with 
the Nova Scotia Writer’s Federa- 
tion’s Critical Reading Service, 
which means I will read and com- 



ment on manuscripts by Nova Sco- 
tians, referred through the Federa- 
tion, for a preset fee depending on 
length of the work. It would be un- 
ethical of me to do the same for 
others for free, and frankly I feel 
that anyone who wants me to read 
and appraise his or her manuscript 
is wasting their time and mine. My 
blanket advice to writers is to ig- 
nore any and all advice on your 
stories unless it comes from an 
editor who says, “I will buy this if 
you make the following changes.’’ 
Enough beginning writers feel dif- 
ferently that I’ve been bludgeoned 
into this Federation gig, but I’m not 
real happy about it. If some dire 
inner compulsion forces you to 
mail me your stories, please do not 
staple them. The staples collect in 
the bottom of the stove and have to 
be shoveled out. 

Do You Have A List Of Your 
Publications? Dept.: I know this 
sounds ego-trippy, but you’d be 
surprised how many have asked. 
Yes I do, and God bless you for 
asking, but I have discovered that it 
takes twenty-five working minutes 
to copy it out longhand. The 
cheapest nearby Xerox machine 
costs a quarter — send me one, and 
return postage (in International Mail 
Coupons, not worthless American 
stamps), and I will happily mail you 
an up-to-date list, including stories 
sold that won’t see print for months 
yet.

and every one of you who has writ- 
ten to me. You have brightened 
nearly every weekday of the past 
year; educated, entertained and 
otherwise uplifted me and Jeanne; 
and helped me enormously in doing 
this job. I appreciate. 

One Last Thing Dept.: Jody Bos- 
ley, one of my ihost faithful letter 
writers, is a young lady who is both 
blind and epileptic, and one of the 
gutsiest, cheerfullest people I know. 
She is also a staunch sf fan — and it 
takes upwards of two years to get a 
book put into Braille when it can be 
done at all {Galaxy is the only sf 
magazine available in Braille. I 
hope that shocks you as much as it 
did me). I strongly urge any of you 
who have the time and caring to 
take an hour of your time, read 
some sf you enjoyed a lot onto cas- 
sette, and mail it to Jody c/o Au- 
tumn Years Lodge, 424 South 
Adams, Fort Worth, Texas 76104. 
Postage is free; just type FREE 
POSTAGE EOR THE BLIND OR 
HANDICAPPED in three lines, 
all capital letters, where you 
would ordinarily put a stamp, and 
the government picks up the tab 
(this works from Canada too; don’t 
know about other parts of the 
world.). 

I know Jody’ll appreciate it; I’d 
take it as a personal favor; and you 
might just acquire the damndest pen 
pal you ever had, a friend well 
worth knowing. 

And now, at long last, the Harlan 
Ellison bonanza I’ve been promising 



you for the last four issues or so. 

One day, several months ago, I 
noticed that there was a mighty 
shitload (note; 2.5 shitloads = 1 
mighty shitload) of Harlan Ellison 
books being piled under my mail- 
box by a weary-looking postman (I 
could tell they were Harlan Ellison 
books because the mailbox shied 
timidly away from them), said, 
“Right — there’s the next column 
right there,’’ and announced same 
in the column I was writing at the 
time. 

Ha. 

Anyone who reads seven books 
of Ellison in seven days will spend 
the eighth in Intensive Care: do not 
exceed the recommended dosage, 
do not attempt to drive a car or op- 
erate heavy machinery while read- 
ing, and discontinue use if emo- 
tional exhaustion occurs. The Sur- 
geon General has determined that 
danger to complacency increases 
with the amount read, and you can 
take that to the bank. 

So what I did, I took seven Elli- 
sons, arranged them in chronologi- 
cal order, and read one every 
couple of weeks, slowly, and that’s 
why it took me so long, okay? 

★ ★ ★ 

The earliest Ellison I could get 
my hands on was his very first, 
Web of the City, but I can’t cover 
that here because Baen won’t let me 
do mainstream (or else I’d sneak in 
John D. MacDonald, William 



92 



GALAXY 



Goldman and the new David Brom- 
berg album, to name only a few). 
The earliest sf Ellison Pyramid sent 
me turned out to be the first Ellison 
I ever read, lo these many moons 
ago; Paingod and Other Delusions. 

Hoo-boy! Such ambiguous feel- 
ings. Look: the Heinlein quote on 
the cover is strictly accurate — this 
book is raw corn liquor. I remember 
with fondness my first hit of raw 
corn liquor. But these days I drink 
Tullamore Dew (when I can get it). 

Paingod contains some of my 
favorite stories of all time: the title 
story and “The Crackpots” are en- 
graved on my brain. But rereading 
them ten years later was ... en- 
lightening. Harlan and I had both 
grown since. The ideas were as 
striking and brilliant as I remem- 
bered, but the craft, the execution 
of those ideas, might best be de- 
scribed as impulsive. As Anne 
McCaffrey says in the blurb, Harlan 
“. writes as if an inner fuse is 
about to blow before he can get all 
the words on his pages.” Fine — but 
this is not how to achieve precision. 
At that point in his career (What? 
Twenty years ago?) Harlan’s talent 
was simply so damn ferocious that 
he had nothing like control over it. 
Often, as in “Wanted In Surgery,” 
he expended yards of his guts on 
stories with moronic premises. 

All right; I winced from time to 
time. But the sheer incandescence 
of Harlan’s energy carried me hand- 
ily through the book, and “ ‘Re- 
pent, Harlequin!’ Said The 



Ticktockman” and “Deeper Than 
Darkness” are acknowledged genre 
classics. The only stories I actively 
disliked were “Bright Eyes” and 
“Wanted In Surgery,” which (since 
I count both introductions plus the 
between-stories-commentary as 
three “stories”) gives the book an 
85% on the Spidermeter. You could 
do worse. 

★ ★ ★ 

You could, for instance, pick up 
/ Have No Mouth and I Must 
Scream. 

Everybody has their own opinion 
about the title story; it’s one of the 
most famous stories in our genre. I 
will concede that it is a work of 
genius but I don’t want it in my 
living room, thank you. It contains 
more ugliness per line than anything 
else ever written, and if you find 
that fascinating, go to it. 

On similar grounds I loathe 
“World of the Myth,” and I didn’t 
need the copyright page to tell me 
that “Big Sam Was My Friend” 
and “Eyes of Dust” were extremely 
early Ellison (1958 and 59 respec- 
tively). 

On the other hand, “Lonelyache,” 
“Delusion for a Dragon Slayer” 
and “Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes” 
are among the best stories Harlan 
ever wrote, pure dynamite in 
form and content. Here we see the 
talent being broken to harness, 
rapidly maturing. By the time 
the smoke clears, we’re back up to

50% on the Meter, and itching 
for the next one. 

* ★ * 

And sure enough, it’s a peach. 
Although eight of the eleven stories 
in From the Land of Fear are 
“early” (1950s) Ellison, all but one 
of them hold up very well indeed. 
Curiously, there are no smashhit 
superfamous classics in this 
collection — and yet the average 
quality is higher than that of Mouth, 
which had four such. A lot of them 
are short, but perfect-, “Life 
Hutch,” for instance, is a master- 
piece of construction and suspense, 
and “Battle Without Banners” still 
wrings out my heart like a dishrag. 
“The Time of the Eye” in particu- 
lar reads like much later than 1959 
Ellison, and “The Sky Is Burning,” 
one of the earliest stories in the col- 
lection, is also one of the finest. 

But my runaway favorites are the 
two versions of “Soldier,” a story 
vaguely like “A Christmas Carol” 
written by the Marquis de Sade. I 
can’t decide which I like better': the 
original short story or the TV script 
it became. The two are quite dis- 
similar despite the fact that they 
share protagonist, situation and es- 
sential theme, and both are beauti- 
fully realized. I learned a lot about 
the mechanics of script adaptation, 
too. 

About a 90% on the Meter.

So I staggered on to Love Ain’t 
Nothing But Sex Misspelled, and 
boy was I prepared to hate it from 
the title. 

I state categorically: this is the 
finest collection of Ellisbn I’ve ever 
seen, and one of the best books I’ve 
ever read. 

There’s a story in there, “The 
Resurgence of Miss Ankle-Strap 
Wedgie,” that if you read it you 
better blink a lot, because it’ll bake 
the moisture right off your eyeballs. 
There’s a story called “Neither 
Your Jenny Nor Mine” which will 
raise blisters on your forebrain. 
There’s stories there that will make 
you shout aloud, will cause your 
eyes to twitch and your stomach to 
do the boogaloo, will (as David 
Bromberg says) “turn your blood to 
water, your brain to jelly . your 
toes to cupcakes ...” and cure 
your hemorrhoids all at the same 
time. 

This collection is what the doc- 
tor ordered and why the preacher 
danced, and I’m damned if I can 
imagine a better use for a buck 
seventy-five. Here is the Ellison 
talent in fullest control, producing 
stories that are as much fun to reread 
as to read the first time, that I’ll 
be coming back to years from now, 
to learn from. 

There’s no point in citing the 
stories by name. Every one is a 
stone masterpiece, and taken to- 
gether they taught me more about 
love than the average Sturgeon 
novel. Call it 120% on the

one!

Which turns out to be nearly as 
enormous, nearly as good, and 
twenty-five cents cheaper. 

Oh, there are a couple of so-so 
stories in Partners In Wonder, and 
one certifiable piece of cheese — but 
Jeezis, what fun! What it is, see, is 
a whole book of collaborations, 
short stories co-authored by Harlan 
with practically everybody, plus in- 
troductions (incorporating bio- 
graphical sketches of the said col- 
laborators) which are as much fun 
as the stories themselves. 

The Bloch/Ellison duet of Jack 
the Ripper stories have since been 



immortalized on record by Alternate 
Worlds Recordings (I’m expecting 
my review copy any day now), and 
I’m told that the playback literally 
scared Harlan out of the studio. 
“Brillo” (with Ben Bova), “Street 
Scene” (Laumer), “Survivor #1” 
(Slesar), “Up Christopher to Mad- 
ness” (Davidson), and of course the 
incomparable “I See A Man Sitting 
On A Chair and the Chair is Bit- 
ing His Leg” (Sheckley — who 
else?) are all among the funniest 
goddam stories I’ve ever seen, each 
in .its own way — I guess it’s easier 
to laugh together than cry. The 
serious stories don’t come off quite 
as well — only “The Song the 
Zombie Sang” (Silverberg — again, 
naturally) was really brilliant. But

Shoulda quit while 1 was ahead. 
Approaching Oblivion purely spoilt 
my digestion. 

First I tripped headlong over an 
introduction which could be de- 
scribed as a trumpet blast of rage, a 
scream of despair. “As for me and 
you in this literary liaison, well. 
I’ve paid my dues. Now I’m going 
to merely sit here on the side and 
laugh my ass off at how you sink 
into the quagmire like the 
triceratops . And if you hear me 
sobbing once in a while, it’s only 
because you’ve killed me too, you 
fuckers.’’ From there (whew!) I 
stumbled into a bleak landscape of 
stories which nearly all had despair 
as their keynote. Only “I’m Look- 
ing for Kadak” (an extended Yid- 
dish lesson) and “Erotophobia’ ’ (an 
extended wet-dream) tried to lighten 
the mood, and perhaps because of 
the setting, both failed, succeeding 
only in looking distinctly out-of- 
place. “Cold Friend’’ and “One 
Life, Furnished In Early Poverty’’ 
are brilliant stories, and milestones 
in Harlan’s career in that if they 
didn’t have his byline on them, you 
might not have guessed they were 
his— but again the setting (and the 
echoing scream of that introduction) 
make it hard to appreciate them. 



“Catman” I actively hated. 

No between-story intros; total 
45%.

So I snatched up the last one in 
the pile, Deathbird Stories, and was 
considerably reassured. I reviewed 
the hardcover version over a year 
ago, from galleys, and found the 
paperback even more impressive 
than I had remembered. No sense 
recapitulating much; with the excep- 
tions of “On the Downhill Side,” 
“Corpse,’’ and “At the Mouse 
Circus” (which three I plain couldn’t 
understand), all of the nineteen 
stories in Deathbird are excellent, 
and at least eight of them are 
genuine masterpieces. Taken to- 
gether, they left me happily 
exhausted and optimistic for the fu- 
ture. I think Harlan is very close to 
a very important truth, concerning 
despair. We’ll see. 

To round out this overview of 
twenty years’ worth of Harlan Elli- 
son, I should add that Harlan’s own 
reading of his classic “Shatterday” 
(on Alternate Worlds Recordings’ 
disc #AWR 6922) is as of this 
writing a finalist for the 1977 Best 
Dramatic Presentation Nebula. 
Since its competition appears to be 
Logan’s Runs and The Man Who 
Fell In Worth, it ought to win hand- 
ily. 

What, you want summatory re- 
marks? At these prices? Okay. 
Taken together (the way I said you 



96 



GALAXY 



shouldn’t take them), these books 
clearly show that over two decades 
Harlan has progressed from damn’ 
promising talent to a genuine Writer 
of Stature (no pun intended), fol- 
lowing a manic-depressive cycle 
that has a kind of consistency and a 
weird beauty of its own. I predict 
that his forthcoming Prince of Sleep 
(contracted to Dell but uncompleted 
as of this writing) will knock us all 
on our ass. Its middle third is the 
magnificent novella which once ran 
here in Galaxy as “The Region Be- 
tween” ... 

All praise to Pyramid, Signet and 
Dell for making all these stories 
available again in paperback.

The Kin of Ata Are Waiting for 
You (formerly published as The 
Comforter) is “the best yet in the 
newly emerging genre of women’s 
fantasy fiction,” according to 
someone named Laurel in some- 
thing called Amazon Quarterly, and 
a publication called Amazon 
Artworks describes it as a “beauti- 
fully written feminist novel.” So 
said the back-cover blurb. 

Consequently I expected to find it 
a large chunk of used food. I have 
no more use for women who like 
the image of the Amazon than I 
have for men who admire Attila 
The Hun, and “women’s fantasy 
fiction” sounds like it’s intended to 
not appeal to me (how about “short 
people’s fantasy fiction”? — they’re 



half the race too, lady.). How im- 
pressed would you be with the Taj 
Mahal if all you knew about it was 
that a couple of termites said it 
tasted terrific? I freely admit I ex- 
pected Ata to be this column’s sac- 
rificial victim. 

Imagine, then, my surprise and 
delight when I found that the book 
is a gem. And this despite the fact 
that the plot has been done many 
times before by flashier writers. It’s 
the old wheeze about the 
contemporary-man-type hero trans- 
planted to a primitive society whose 
mores freak him out — which chump 
only gradually realizes that the 
primitive society is a utopia and the 
“ignorant” natives are more to- 
gether than he is. Sturgeon’s used 
several variants of it, Chad Oliver’s 
excellent “Marginal Man” is 
another example that springs to 
mind, and this book is one of the 
very best I’ve seen. 

Feminist, phooey! It’s humanist, 
with malice toward none, a deeply 
spiritually rewarding book that 
taught me some things. And at the 
same time it’s an exciting read that 
never lost my interest — the opening 
grabbed me by the scruff of the col- 
lar and yanked. And it features 
some of the cleanest, sparest, 
simplest prose I’ve seen all year, 
not a superfluous word in the book. 
Like six brush strokes on rice pa- 
per, exquisite. 

It’s a genuine shame Ms. Bryant 
had to market this as a “feminist” 
book. It’s “co-published” by Moon 



BOOKSHELF

Books (I’m sorry — it makes me 
think of my outhouse door), an in- 
dependent women’s publishing 
company, and Random House, 
which does the distributing; and 
having thus decided on a minority 
audience they printed up a fat ten 
thousand copies of a hardcover-sized 
paperback and priced ’em at three 
dollars a hit. Consequently even the 
few of you who are perceptive 
enough to realize that my taste is 
impeccable and will buy a book just 
on my say-so will probably be un- 
able to find or afford it. 

Which is a shame. It’s a peachy 
book, and Dorothy Bryant is a 
writer whose byline I’ll look for. If 
this had been handled right when it 
was first released in 1971, it could 
have been a Hugo finalist.

Baen apparently hijacked the 
Avon shipment and ripped off the 
review copy of The Judgement of 
Eve (uttering, no doubt, the prover- 
bial Editorial “Wheee!”) but who 
could blame him? Fortunately, a 
generous fan who shall renane 
maimless mailed me a copy which 
arrived on the same day that the 
Avon review shipment showed up 
one light. Don’t worry about it, 
Jim. Really. [/ have no idea what 
he’s talking about. — Ed.] 

Don’t let the strikingly ugly cover 
painting by Patrick Woodruffe dis- 
may you, folks — this is some of 
Edgar’s best stuff, just heart- 



warmingly good. There are his 
usual vibrantly alive characters, his 
profound insights, his merriment 
and his sorrow and his gusty ap- 
preciation of both, all the ingre- 
dients that add up to a continuous 
warm glow in your middle. The 
central question of the novel is 
nothing less than “What is love?’’ 
and it answers it damned well in my 
opinion. Typical Pangbom, in short. 

In fact. I’d be praising it 
unreservedly — if it wasn’t for the 
damned ending, which seems to me 
like a cop-out. I suspect — I would 
like to thinks — that Edgar wanted to 
end it with a menage-a-quatre but 
couldn’t get the publishers in 1966 
to accept that. This may not be 
true — but then, as Edgar himself 
said on page 61 , “If there were only 
one kind of truth or only, say, half 
a dozen, the poor damned human 
race would have had to close up 
shop before discovering the control 
of fire.’’ 

One of the best in Avon’s SF 
Rediscovery Series, nearly as good 
as A Mirror for Observers (their 
other Pangborn entry. Are they 
going to do West of the Suni).

The Long View is the final third 
or so of Buzz Busby’s massive Ris- 
sa Kerguelen saga, the first two- 
thirds of which (aptly titled Rissa 
Kerguelen) I reviewed here fa- 
vorably a few months ago. It had 
been a long time between books. 



98 



GALAXY 



and the first was so enormous and 
detailed I had frankly forgotten 
parts of it by the time I settled 
down with The Long View. But I 
managed to hang on, and enjoyed 
the finish a bunch. Incredibly, in 
that wealth of color and detail there 
are threads that began in the open- 
ing chapters and ran invisibly 
through both books until, jerked 
upon in the last pages, they made 
the whole weave fall together in a 
pleasing pattern. Busby reminds me 
of Larry Niven, in his combination 
of multidisciplinary education, out- 
rageous imagination and rigorous 
logic. 

I can’t honestly call this a Great 
Book — it remains, in the end, good 
adventure and no more. I don’t 
know that it couldn’t have done 
with some editing and trimming. 
But it’s cracking good adventure, 
with a really strong protagonistper- 
son and some dynamite surprises 
planted at the end, and that’s a lot 
to ask in these troubled times. 

Make note: Long View is not re- 
ally a self-contained entity. This is 
not Busby’s fault nor Berkley’s: 
economics dictated that the book be 
cut in two, and they did their best. 
But the upshot is, if you didn’t read 
Rissa Kerguelen, you don’t want 
just this one. 

On the other hand, if you did, 
you don’t want to stop now, do 
you? 

Dis is de climax.

and you want to re-evoke some of 
the divine insanity, by all means 
pick up a copy of The Noreascon 
Proceedings, a transcript of every 
official word spoken at the 
Twenty-Ninth World Science Fic-

exceptionally fine panels and 
speeches (by such notables as Ben

Toastburger Silvermast (pay no at-

bership statistics, art show and 
masquerade awards, business and 
financial reports, and quite a 
number of juicy photographs of the 
events and festivities (many of these 
by the acknowledged master of fan 
fotography, Jay Kay Klein). Leslie 
Turek’s editing job is superb. 

I know twelve skins seems like a 
lot of bread, but look at it this way. 
At the last Worldcon at-the-door 
registration was over four times 
that, plus travel, accommodations and 
meals. Here you’re getting an 
early-registration price, saving your- 
self the ancillary expenses, and you 
have the assurance of knowing in 
advance that the Con is a good one. 



And if you really want to experi-

of a Worldcon, but can’t afford to 
go to Miami— just take this book 
down to Grand Central Station or 
your local equivalent, wash down 
five hundred mikes of acid with two 
quarts of beer, and try to read it. 
That’ll be close. (Note to the humor- 
less everywhere: 1 do not seriously 
advocate this procedure. I don’t 
recommend that humorless people 
attend Worldcons, either.) 

Oh yeah — NESFA (New England

GALAXY 




H.1S NAME WAS Skitch Herron, and 
when I first saw him he was in on 
his back in an oxy tent, trying to 
breathe and not quite making it. His 
breath was making little patches of 
fog on the plastic and his chest was 
stuttering; his eyes, when he turned 
them toward me, were deep and 
empty and lonely. He blinked twice 
at me and I nodded; I was still 
wearing an earring, the old style, 
and a nod was enough. 

He’s dying, Kelly,” the doctor 
said. I thought his voice was too 
loud and wanted to tell him to shut 
up. “He knows it.” 

Herron looked at me — he hadn’t 
taken his eyes from me; he knew 
who I was and why I was there — 
and blinked his eyes again. He 
knew . 

“I’m dying,” he said. The voice 
came out of the speaker above the 
bed. I waited, there not being much 
1 could say. I’d seen dying Spacers 
before, a lot of them, and they all 
looked the same way: thin, their 
muscles atrophied and pulpy at the 
same time, gasping for air even in a 
tent. 

“I want to go back to Earth, 
Kelly,” he said. “Before I die.” 
They all wanted to go back — every 
one. After Jumping, the ships, the 
Cedrics, the planetfalls, and every- 
thing else, the Spacers wanted to 
come home. To die. Always. 

“Okay,” I said. “I’ll bring you 
home.” 

★ ★ ★ 



We grew up wanting to be 
Spacers, remembering the stories 
about the early ones — Glenn and 
Armstrong and O’Dell — and the 
ones who followed them: 

Kanderson, who died on Deimos 
trying to save the bubble when an 
oxygen tank exploded . 

Matterly, bleeding to death inside 
his suit, trying to link up power 
lines when Passenger Four walked 
into an asteroid spray . 

Malik, who touched down on sev- 
enteen planets, a record neve*- bro- 
ken, and who finally bought li on a 
tiny rock no one had ever heard 
of . 

There ’d never been anything like 
it — the Crusades, the westward ex- 
pansion of nineteenth century 
America, World War II: they were 
tiny, isolated events compared to 
the second push for Space. This 
was a whole world — the Russians, 
Japanese, all of us — building and 
hoping and watching. 

We were the eighth Spacer class, 
the Miskin Class: he had been killed 
in Sector Five — all our heroes were 
dead — when the scout ship he’d 
taken down had crashed. The light 
ships only carried one scout then, 
so that there was no way of going 
down for him, but he kept sending 
up data — soil and atmosphere in- 
formation mostly — until his voice 
grew so weak that it was unintelli- 
gible. Years later they found him— 
the ship pitted with age, his body 
still inside — and we felt good know- 
ing that we had not been ill-named. 



102 



GALAXY 



It was a long, tough grind — the 
Commission saw Spacer training as 
a combination boot camp, research 
laboratory, and cheap labor source. 
We were thrown up into space with 
almost no training and we worked 
for days to assemble the first of the 
microwave beamers, the first of the 
Floats, the firsts of almost every- 
thing. The men who couldn’t take 
the null-grav threw up into their 
suits and went back down; the rest 
of us moved on to the shuttles, the 
haulers, and finally the Light Ships. 

We drilled constantly, studied 
every diagram, every wiring chart, 
until we knew 'them in our sleep. 
We had our own jobs, of course, 
but we had to know everyone 
else’s, too: a meteorite that holed 
the outer skin wasn’t going to ask if 
we were at General Quarters. 

We drilled constantly, hitting the 
pad and then the GQ whistle going 
off an hour later and the Master 
shrieking “Up, up, into the ship, 
into the ship” at us, and then the 
fifty of us, sleep-fogged and 
nervous, running through the night 
to the dials and gauges. 

“What’s the pressure in an An- 
derson tube?” 

“Give me the numbers of the 
seven Emergency ffeqs.” 

Drilling and drilling and drilling 
until the fifty of us — the forty — 
the thirty — twenty-seven — twenty- 
four — were like brothers, until 
we knew the ship like we’d once 
known our own rooms, until we 
thought that the constant smell 

SKITCH AND THE KIDS 



of plastic and oil and recycled air 
was normal, and the constant hum 
and vibration and muttering of a 
thousand small fans and motors and 
pumps and the shake of the ship 
was a part of us; until there was 
only one thing left: Jump and Jump 
Space. We’d be Spacers then. 
Spacers, we said, and couldn’t be- 
lieve it was really hapj^ening to us. 

* * * 

Going down, the Jockey let me 
handle the ship until we touched the 
outer beacon. He didn’t have to, of 
course, could have gotten in trouble 
if anyone else had known. But he 
knew what it meant to me — 
watching the slow climb of the red 
needle as the anti-grav unit kicked 
in, worked itself back down. Feel- 
ing the hum of engines through the 
palm of my hand, I could almost 
feel as though I were working 
again. 

Herron was unconscious when I 
checked him. Just as well: as I 
strapped down, I could feel the grav 
on me and I forced myself to take 
breaths, wished I was back on the 
Float, in Space, in Jump Space. 
And I knew what the grav was 
doing to Herron’s lungs; I knew 
what it was doing to mine

“Stand by for Jump.” 

I waited by medical stores — my 
normal battle station — sitting, wait-

ing, fingers tingling in excitement. 
Jump . not one person in a mil- 
lion had been through it . I’d be 
a real Spacer then . .a Spacer. 

And then . .nothing: they had 
told me that some men would 
scream in agony as the ship 
Jumped, that others would moan or 
throw up. I waited for something to 
happen. 

The doctor looked at me. He was 
moving his mouth back and forth, 
rubbing his fingers together as if 
they itched. After a while he 
stopped. 

“We’re through Jump,’’ he said. 

“I didn’t feel a thing.” 

“You will. Jump is like nothing 
else.” 

I was halfway through my pil- 
grim check — going down the ranks 
of the men, women, and children in 
Long Sleep, headed for one of the 
outer planets — when I began to feel 
Jump. 

The ship tingled in Jump, almost 
imperceptibly, but it was there, a 
vibration so small that men with 
one drink in them — soldiers and 
sailors have been making illegal 
liquor for centuries — couldn’t feel 
it, but it was real and it made ev- 
erything glimmer and shine in ways 
they didn’t in normal space. 

We felt more alive in it — I did 
anyway and could run through the 
entire twenty-four on two hours of 
sleep, week in and week out with 
no loss of efficiency. Food tasted 
better, music sounded better, and 
when we went into the iso room for 

104 



the required daily workout, we 
could pull more, lift more, and 
walk out feeling better than ever 
before. 

But what made it the best was the 
view ports. Even the physicists 
weren’t sure what made the sky in- 
side Jump look the way it did — and 
they had instruments on it all the 
time, spools whirring and dials tick- 
ing off numbers, trying to learn 
what was out there — but it was no 
longer just the dots and pinpoints of 
light we could see from subspace. 
Even the ether glowed and the view 
was red or green one moment, blue 
and yellow the next; it would 
lighten for an instant until the whole 
ship was bathed in a soft, yellow 
light like the- old oil paintings, and 
then the light would fade to a 
blackness so absolute, so deep that 
men seeing it for the first time 
would tremble in terror. We were 
falling, falling, falling into it . 

And that would fade, too, be- 
come green lightning hurling at us, 
dancing on the brow of the ship; 
shimmer to a turquoise that washed 
ver us; go to a red, a pale yellow, 
ack to black. ...

Coming into the dome, the colors 
were gray and brown and a pale, 
governmental green — the semi-clear 
dome itself streaked with dust, 
scratched by the blowing sand, the 
squat shuttle ships stained with 
grease and dirt, the shelter and stor- 
age flimsies tired and faded: even 

GALAXY 



under the dome the sun was strong. 

Even the smell was wrong — dust 
and oil and recycled air — when they 
write a history of the Space Move- 
ment, they’ll have to say that it was 
done on someone else’s oxygen — 
but not the way it smelled aboard 
ship. Not even the way it smelled 
aboard the Floats. There was a dirt 
smell to it — and the grav hurt my 
lungs, made my legs ache. 

★ ★ ★ 

On my second trip out — another 
run to drop pilgrims and stores on 
another new planet — a man named 
Damyell came into Medical. When 
he coughed, he said, he could taste 
blood. 

“I want to go home,” he said. 

“Home?” 

“Earth, Kelly. I want to see 
Earth again.” 

He lay down on one of the 
benches — we had a Rodgers Vari- 
able Grav unit and there was just 
enough pressure to make a man 
want to lie down — and he talked 
about home, about growing up, 
about trees and mountains and 
what it had been like to ride a horse. 

We broke out of Jump, came close 
to planetfall, and held Reveille 
on the Pilgrims. Damyell, in pain 
now, and semiconscious most of 
the time — he was coughing blood 
by then, a week after he came into 
the office — could sense the presence 
of the planet and he wanted to be 
down there.

SKITCH AND THE KIDS 



105 



“It’s not Earth,” I told him. 

“It’s land, Kelly. It has flowers 
and water on it — that’s why the pil- 
grims are going. Ask them to take 
me down, Kelly. Ask them.” 

I went to the Captain and asked. 
He said there’d be no way to get 
Darnyell back: the shuttle would 
meet us in orbit, off-load the pil- 
grims, and we’d never see them 
again. 

“He’ll be dead in a few days 
anyway,” I told him. 

“Okay.” I helped load Darnyell 
aboard— even in the five percent 
gravity of parking orbit he couldn’t 
walk — and then to strap him in. 

“Thanks, Kelly,” he said. There 
was a pink froth on his lips and I 
wiped it with a towel. “I won’t 
forget this.” 

An hour later he was dead. As the 
shuttle dropped out of orbit and into 
point-five G, then point-six, point- 
eight, his heart and lungs couldn’t 
take the extra gravity and he died. 

Without seeing a tree. 

it it it 

From the outside, it never looked 
like much — just a dome in a corner 
of the settlement dome, with the 
dust and smoke and noise outside it. 
When I brought Skitch Herron into 
it, he was still unconscious. 

He blinked slowly when I opened 
the door of the Rest-Easy and the 
air hit him — it always hits them — 
and he tried to sit up. 

“Easy,” I said. “Not yet.” I un- 



locked the stretcher, put it onto the 
ground, dropped the wheels. 
“Now.” I gave him a shot and 
waited for it to take. He stopped 
strangling on the sputum and man- 
aged to sit up. I had to help him 
onto the stretcher; with the sickness, 
with the five years he’d spent in 
null-grav, his muscles didn’t work 
anymore. 

“Oh, God,” he said. “I didn’t 
know.” I put the pillow under his 
head and reached for a blanket. It 
was spring — it always was — and 
some of them couldn’t take the 
temperatures. He shook it off and 
blinked his eyes against the sun, the 
lids of them crusty and old so that 
even shut they didn’t help much. 

“I forgot,” he said. He blinked 
his eyes some more and I let him 
look for about three minutes before 
I pushed the stretcher. 

The field was green and it was 
full of daisies. There were flecks of 
white painted onto the blue sky. 1 
could hear the birds singing — the 
field was planted with special 
bushes for them — and a squirrel ran 
across the path in front of us. 

“How could I leave this?” He 
coughed again — the shot does that 
to them — and I leaned over to wipe 
his mouth. “I can hear ducks, 
Kelly.” 

“We’ll go there,” I said. We 
went through the tall grass to the 
pond. There was a sandy beach, 
tiny footprints in it, a pail and 
shovel, and shadows flitting through 
the water.

GALAXY 



“Can’t see the fish,” Herron 
said. “Just the shadows.” He 
coughed again and I had to wipe his 
mouth. “Thanks.” From across the 
pond the ducks heard us and began 
to quack over, rippling the lily pads 
as they swam. 

“I have some bread,” I said. 
“They’ll want it.” I propped an- 
other pillow under him so he could 
throw. The water was twelve feet 
away and he could barely reach it. 
The ducks fought for the bread, 
quacking. I lifted Herron off the 
stretcher and put him onto a blan- 
ket, then put a basket with wine and 
cheese beside him. 

He looked at it. Spacers didn’t 
get wine and cheese very often. I 
cut a piece of cheese for him, 
poured him some wine. He nibbled, 
then sipped. 

“This is either Earth or . .” he 
coughed again . “the condemned 
man’s last meal.” He looked at me. 

“It’s Earth,” I said. “You made 
it, Skitch.” He looked at the wine 
again and then winced as pain stab- 
bed through him.

Darnyell had been the first to die 
that we knew about — but he wasn’t 
the first: other ships lost men, too, 
and we’d hear stories when we 
docked to dump pilgrims or to load 
stores: “Cable lost two men . 
Morgan is dead.” 

It was surprising, scary in a way, 
but mostly unexpected because 

SKITCH AND THE KIDS 



Spacers — who grew up worshipping 
dead men — weren’t supposed to die. 

Explorers we could understand 
dying. They asked for it and when 
they piled up a scout ship on one of 
the crazy-gravity planets; ran for 
weeks with Big Eye and then col- 
lapsed, babbling, from lack of 
sleep; or when they went nuts in 
Jump Space and never came out, so 
that they rattled around the universe 
like ghosts — we could see the ships 
on the Jensen Scope, but no one 
ever saw them again — we said 
“That’s the way it goes” and 
someone named a Float or a ship or 
Spacer class after them. But we 
weren’t supposed to die. 

But we did. No one was sure 
why. They’d have us retain the 
bodies for them if the men died in 
Jump Space, but they never learned 
much. Maybe the null-grav, some 
people said, and they wanted us to 
spend more time in the Rodgers 
unit; maybe the extra radiation; the 
hum in Jump; lack of sunlight; defi- 
ciency of an undiscovered vitamin. 

Whatever it was, men were dy- 
ing. They came into sick bay tired, 
some of them coughing blood, all 
of them wanting to go home. And 
that was the strangest thing of all. 

Space was where we wanted to 
be. Sure, we talked of home and 
when someone brought out pictures 
of the Titan Mountains or the Green 
Hills of Bron, we’d admire them. 
And from time to time we’d make a 
drop to throw a dmnk or a laugher. 
But when we broke the pilgrims out 



107 



of Long Sleep and they clustered 
around the view ports to see their 
new planet, we let them look: see- 
ing a planet was, nothing compared 
to Jump Space. And if someone 
wanted to go back to Earth to flow- 
ers and trees and bugs, we joked, 
then he must be sick. And we 
laughed it off and decided that 
Space was worth the risks. 

And then, one day we docked at 
Titan Float One and I could taste 
blood. 

★ ★ * 

The boy was five and the girl 
was eight. They came over the hill, 
the girl in front, protective. We 
watched them come toward us, 
singing, pushing through the daisies 
and the tall grass. 

Herron just looked at them. He 
held a glass of wine in one hand 
and didn’t touch it at all. When the 
kids were eight yards away, he 
waved weakly to them, as if afraid 
they’d vanish. The girl looked at 
the boy, then to us, back to him. 

“Wave,” she said. The boy 
waved and dropped his hand quick- 

'y- 

“I have to go to the car,” I said. 
“They might want to look at the 
ducks with you, even throw bread.” 

From thirty yards away I could 
watch them, the children coming 
closer, Herron smiling, holding the 
bread, trying to throw the bread to 
the ducks, but not strong enough to 
hit the water. 



The children came closer. Herron 
smiled and touched the towel to his 
mouth. The girl took a piece of 
bread and threw it to the ducks. 
They quacked, she laughed, and the 
little boy clapped his hands. Herron 
gave him a piece of bread and the 
boy threw it. I was hoping that Her- 
ron couldn’t see how far the boy 
could throw. 1 could hear what they 
were saying from the transmitter in 
the basket. 

“What’s your name?” 

“Skitch. What’s yours?” 

“Anne. This is Moby. He’s my 
brother.” 

“Hi, Moby.” I could see Herron 
touch the towel to his mouth again. 
In the gravity, his lungs were 
shredding. 

“How come you’re here?” 

“I came to see the ducks.” 

“You don’t live here.” 

“I’m a Spacer.” 

“A real Spacer?” I could see 
their eyes get big. To a kid whose 
chair-bound father worked as a 
lawyer or supply clerk, Spacers 
were magic. They were brave and 
daring and romantic with the ear- 
rings and tired eyes, smiling at 
pretty girls, posing for the posters 
which showed the rocket ships 
blasting off from an eroded moon. 

“I’m a real Spacer,” Herron 
said. 

The kids inched in to see his 
earring. “What’s the Milky Way 
like?” 

“Did you go to lo?” 

“Can you fly a ship?” 



108 



GALAXY 



“Did you see a monster?” 

He told them — and most of the 
things were true: what it was like to 
take out a scout ship, to have the 
Cedrics screaming and rocking, 
threatening to tear the ship apart; 
what the sand demons looked like 
on Andros; how he had flown into 
Titan and seen the waiting moun- 
tains; what a comet looked like as it 
rushed toward the ship and how it 
dissolved from wonder to nothing- 
ness; and he told them about 
Jump — the slow whine and then, for 
him, a touch of blackness, then the 
hum, and the walking around in de- 
light. 

★ ★ ★ 

“You can’t jump again,” the 
doctors told me. There were four of 
them standing around me, others lis- 
tening: I’d been moved from Float 
One to Three, the one with the hos- 
pital. 

“Can’t jump?” I couldn’t believe 
it. “I have to . I’m a Spacer.” 

“We think Jump is part of the 
cause,” they said. “Shuttle pilots 
don’t cough blood. Float men don’t. 
Only Spacers do — and you’re one 
of the men who has it.” 

“If I can’t be a Spacer, I don’t 
know what to do,” I said. “They 
don’t need many corpsmen on 
Earth, do they?” 

“We don’t think you can go back 
to Earth, either. Whatever you 
had — have — has been arrested . 
we think. At least you’re not losing 

SKITCH AND THE KIDS 



blood anymore. But we think that 
if you ever hit full gravity again, 
your lungs will rupture.” 

“Not much of a choice,” I said. 
“No Space and no Earth either,” 
“There are still things you can 
do. You can work the shuttles, the 
Float, any of a dozen other places.” 
“I’m trapped.” 

“It’s better than being dead.” 

I looked at him — the oldest of 
them watching. He had the look 
that they all have — all the Earth- 
bound, gravity-bound, floor- 
trapped, non-earring people do: 
half arrogance, half fear and self- 
consciousness. 

“Have you ever jumped?” I 
asked him. 

“No.” 

“How do you know it’s better 
than being dead?” 

Nobody said anything for a mo- 
ment. I limjted to the viewport and 
looked out to the shuttle being tied 
up, the hunkies floating around, at- 
taching lines and hooks, and beyond 
it — the pinpoints of light that were 
the stars I’d never get to see again, 
all the places I’d never get to: 
no more Cedric scream, no more 
Jump, no more planetfall. 

And no trees or flowers or bushes 
either. No waterfalls or chickadees 
. .for me or for the thousands of 
other men who dreamed of a ring, 
who’d made it, and who couldn’t 
go back anymore . suddenly I 
wanted to see Earth again ... 

I turned back to the doctors. 

“I have an idea,” I said. 



109 



★ ★ ★ 



The kids sat there listening to 
Herron talk, touching him from 
time to time, and he patted their 
heads, talking and coughing into the 
towel. I let him talk a while, then 
he asked the kids some ques- 
tions— where they went to school 
and what kinds of foods they liked 
and what were they going to be 
when they grew up — Moby said he 
wanted to be a Spacer like 
Skitch — and I walked over. Herron 
looked at me and I knelt beside him 
to give him a clean towel. The in- 
side of the old one was pink and 
frothy. 

I looked at the kids, over to the 
ducks, to my watch. The shot lasted 
thirty minutes at most; we’d been 
there twenty. 

“Aren’t yoqr folks going to miss 
you?” I asked the kids. Herron’s 
eyes fixed on me for a moment as 
though I’d stolen his toy, then went 
to acceptance. 

“We have to be home at four,” 
Anne said. “Is it almost four 
now?” 

“Almost,” I said. 

“It was good to talk to you. Mis- 
ter Skitch,” she said. “Say bye to 
Mister Skitch, Moby.” 

“Bye, Mister Skitch.” 

“Wait,” Herron said. He held 
his hand up. His eyes were damp. 
“Here.” He took his bracelet 
off — it was from the hullmetal of 
ANDRESHKOV, the first of the 
Light Ships — and handed it to 



Moby. He unscrewed the earring 
and gave it to the girl. “Take 
’em,” he said. 

“Thank you.” She said it very 
softly. Then she leaned over and 
kissed him on the forehead. She 
turned, took her brother’s hand, and 
they left us. We saw them walk up 
the hill slowly, the daisies falling 
around them, springing back to 
cover their path. They turned and 
looked back once to wave. We waved 
back and they were gone. 

“I told them the truth,” Herron 
said, “about being a Spacer. The 
work, the ship. Jump. I wouldn’t 
swap it . .” He coughed into the 
towel again and it was black. 

“I know . .you were a good 
Spacer.” 

“I was young once . like that 
kid, Moby ...” His whole chest 
convulsed and he sprayed the blan- 
ket with flecks of red-and-black 
foam. “He wants to . they’ll 
have it cured ...” He began 
coughing again, couldn’t get the 
words out. He let me lie him down, 
head on the pillow, turned so that 
he dribbled onto the blanket. He 
clenched and unclenched his fists as 
if trying to gather strength. 

“We’re not on Earth,” he said, 
fighting the pain as the shot wore 
off. “I think it’s the moon ... a 
dummy.” 

“Earth,” I said. 

“I’m dying, Kelly. Don’t lie.” 
The words were crawling out of 
him, tiny, red balloons breaking on 
his lips.

f “It’s Earth,” I said. “This is 
Pennsylvania.” 

“Think it’s a game . make the 
Spacer think he’s made it.” 
“Pennsylvania.” I had to make 
•; him believe it. 

; “Right.” He squeezed my hand 
; as hard as he could; I could have 
I broken the grip with two fingers. 
I His eyes caught mine and all I 
I could see was the guy who’d been 
' young once, seen Jump Space, re- 
membered it, and was dying. He 
smiled and the shot broke — he con- 
vulsed as the pain hit him like a 
hammer. 

' “There’s another shot,” I whis- 
pered. I touched his mouth with the 
towel and he shook it away. 

“There’s another shot?” 

I nodded. 

“Gimme . .please.” 



I did. Then I waited five minutes 
and had a cigarette — I always 
did — before I put him onto the 
stretcher and brought him back to 
the Rest- Easy. 

I was leaving the dome when the 
kids came back in. Anne looked at 
me for -a moment; she was holding 
the bracelet. 

“He was the nicest one,” she 
said. She blinked twice, looked at 
the bracelet, at the feet under the 
blanket in the Rest-Easy. Then she 
walked on past, up the hill, through 
the grass and the daisies. I thought 
she’d look back and wave, but she 
didn’t. I blinked once and then she 
was gone. ^

Convicted to a life of 
hard labor on the High 
Frontier, he found that 
the lot of a vatman is 
not a happy one! 



1 . ES, WHAT WALDO TOLD YOU is 
quite true. He did get an award for 
his efforts on the Venus terra- 
forming project, and his medal is 
genuine. Been boasting again, has 
he? I’ll bet he didn’t mention that 
the President of the United Space 
Federation opposed the award. Or 
that it was touch and go whether he 
got a reward or a life sentence. 

No, the President’s view had 
nothing to do with politics. It was a 
good deal more personal than that. 

Let’s start at the trial — that’s 
where I got involved. Waldo and I 
have been friends and partners since 
law school. I couldn’t believe my 
ears when I heard he’d been ar- 
rested for drug smuggling. Taliza’s 
the worst drug on the list, the 
pusher’s dream. Total addiction 
after one snort. And Waldo disap- 
proves even of tobacco. It was so 
out of character that I was sure he 
must be innocent. 

The drug ring had been extracting 
pure taliza from the plants, then 
putting it into metal powder com- 
pacts and shipping them all over 
Earth. Waldo had handled all the 
shipping and customs details. He 
made no attempt to deny it. He said 
he’d been approached, out of the 
blue, by a group who wanted to use 
his experience in international work. 
That seemed reasonable, because 
he’d worked for years in the inter- 
national market. But there were 
snags. 

“You say you believed,” said 
the prosecuting counsel, “that 

DINSDALE DISSENTS 



somebody would pay you ten 
thousand credits a month, just to 
make shipping arrangements for a 
lot of cheap brass compacts? Isn’t 
that much higher than your usual 
rates, Mr. Burmeister?” 

Waldo hummed and hawed. He 
didn’t have a good answer. If you 
ask me, he had suspected from the 
start that something shady was 
going on. I think he may even have 
guessed at smuggling — but gold, 
not drugs. As I say, Waldo has cer- 
tain standards of honor. 

I became increasingly uneasy as 
the prosecutor kept coming back to 
Waldo’s ‘refusal’ to name the origi- 
nal source of the drug, or the other 
members of the ring. Waldo swore 
that he’d received no information 
except for the shipping details and 
knew nothing of any other people 
involved. It was a stand-off, but I 
could sense the jury tilting the 
wrong way. Innocence through ig- 
norance is never a strong defense, 
and they could tell that it was con- 
trary to Waldo’s natural ego. The 
judge’s summing-up, in which 
Waldo was painted as the leader of 
a desperate band of heartless vil- 
lains, didn’t help a bit. 

The jury was out less than ten 
minutes. Guilty. Waldo, protesting 
his innocence, was sentenced to 
serve three years on Venus Station. 

I promised to write. 

★ ★ ★ 

It’s amazing how many people 

113 



think, as I did, that the Venus 
terra-forming project is on Venus; 
actually that won’t come for another 
three hundred years. All the work is 
done in orbit at Venus Station, 
seven hundred kilometers above the 
planet. The Station looks like two 
big wheels, four hundred meters 
across, on a common axle. I’d seen 
pictures of it, but that was all I 
knew until Waldo described it. The 
upper wheel. Station Up, spins — 
you get about one gee at the outer 
rim. It has all the hydroponics, air 
equipment and recycling equip- 
ment— and all the convicts. The 
lower wheel doesn’t rotate. It s 
Station Down, and it acts as the 
docking facility and houses the algal 
seeders. 

Waldo arrived at Station Down 
after a boring two-month flight from 
Earth, along with twenty other pris- 
oners. I gather he was not im- 
pressed by his companions. They 
ranged from a mad bomber who had 
blown up the store that sold him a 
defective umbrella, to an illiterate 
janitor who had done in his wife 
when she refused to read stories to 
him. What annoyed Waldo was the 
way the rest of them looked down 
on him, as an unspeakable drug- 
master, destroyer of the young, per- 
verter of the innocent. That, plus 
the fact that the bunks on the ship 
were designed for someone half his 
girth, made his life miserable. It 
shows how strange the world can 
be. A few months earlier, Waldo 
would have taken bets that he could 

114 



never be glad to arrive at Venus 
Station to serve a prison sentence. 
But he saw Station Down swim into 
view with a great sense of relief. 

After they docked he was taken 
to the Prison Admissions Office on 
Station Up. The work assignment 
supervisor there had a summary of 
Waldo’s background, with the test 
results. He looked at them and 
shook his head. 

“The only position I’ve got for 
you right now is as a Number Three 
Vatman, on the lower hydroponics 
level. One good thing about that, 
you’ll have a gravity close to what 
you were used to on Earth. And it’s 
a very important job; we all depend 
on the hydroponics.” 

Waldo frowned. It sounded as 
though it might be manual labor. 
He’d hoped for an administrative 
position — perhaps even a legal post. 

“This vatman job. It doesn’t 
. sound as though it will make use of 
my skills. I’m sure I have the qual- 
ifications to fill a management slot 
for you here. Don’t you have at 
least a clerical assignment avail- 
able?” 

“Not for your background.” The 
supervisor looked sadly at Waldo’s 
papers. “You have to understand, 
Mr. Burmeister, there’s no shortage 
of lawyers in the prison. We have 
enough of you to fill all our clerical 
needs three times over. If you’d 
been a trained plumber now, or an 
electrician, that would be a different 
matter. You should find this job 
rewarding,” he added, seeing Wal- 

GALAXY 



do’s expression. “Recycling is a 
very important function. You’ll 
have full control of all the stirring, 
filtering and additive operations on 
the Number Three vat line.” 

It was manual work all right. 
Waldo didn’t like the sound of it at 
all. 

“But what’s in the vats?” he 
asked. “JUst what is it you are re- 
cycling?” 

The supervisor told him. Waldo 
liked the sound of it even less. He 
made one more try. “Look, there 
must be some other jobs open here. 
Surely all the prisoners don’t have 
useful trades. There must be jobs 
here on the Station that don’t cor- 
respond to anything back on 
Earth.” 

“Oh yes, there are. There’s one 
vacancy right now for a scout ship 
operator. A very responsible posi- 
tion. They fly down into the at- 
mosphere of Venus everyday, and 
monitor the level that the algae 
reach before they become too hot to 
function. Unfortunately, that job has 
a weight limit.” He looked at Wal- 
do’s bulk with misgiving. “You 
don’t look less than ninety kilos. 
I’m afraid, so I didn’t mention it to 
you.” 

Thank heaven for fat. Waldo 
mentally hugged his poundage to 
him. The last job he wanted was to 
be plunged into Venus’ searing 
atmosphere as a sort of human 
dip stick. He should have kept his 
mouth shut. 

“I’ll keep your interest in the 
DINSDALE DISSENTS 



scout work in mind,” the supervisor 
said encouragingly. “And don’t 
worry about the vat work. I’m told 
that the smell is just a temporary 
problem. There’s been something 
wrong with the chemical balance on 
the lowest level of tanks. Don’t 
forget, in a year or so you’ll be 
eligible for reassignment. I’ll mark 
your interest in scouting down on 
your form here but I’m sure you’ll 
soon settle in and make friends on 
the hydroponics work.” 

★ ★ * 

Curiously enough, the super- 
visor’s optimistic prediction seemed 
to be right. The chief of the hy- 
droponics area was a big bruiser 
named Katuki, who for some reason 
seemed delighted to see Waldo. He 
shook hands with enthusiasm and 
slapped him on the back. 

“Hey, I’m really pleased to meet 
you, Mr. Burmeister. I’ve heard 
about you, but I didn’t know you 
were going to be working down 
here. I thought it was impossible to 
rig the computers that assign people 
to different jobs. Sometime I’d like 
you to tell me how you worked it.” 

Waldo smiled modestly. 

“It’s good to get a bit of class in 
the place,” Katuki went on. “The 
other fellers are good guys, but I 
don’t mind telling you some of 
them aren’t the brightest. Stop by 
my area as soon as you’re settled 
in, and I’ll introduce you to the 
other vatmen.”

Waldo was gratified. It was nice 
to be appreciated, even if the 
speaker’s appearance was a little 
off-putting. At some time in the 
past Katuki’s face seemed to have 
lost a major argument with some- 
thing hard and irregular. 

Waldo felt even more pleased lat- 
er, when Katuki introduced him to 
the other four vatmen with a big 
build-up. No one had praised his 
brains so much for years. It’s all 
relative, I suppose. A couple of 
others, according to Waldo, would 
have been hard pressed to decide 
which end of a stirring paddle to 
hold without guidance from Katuki. 

Glasses and a bottle were pro- 
duced from a locker and Katuki 
poured generous shots of a dark 
brown liquid. “Here’s to our new 
buddy, Waldo Burmeister,’’ he 
said, handing them around. “I 
know he’s going to be a real help to 
the operation here.’’ 

Waldo hesitated, glass in hand, 
and looked at the door. “I’m sure 
you know best, but isn’t this a bit 
risky? What about the guards?’’ 
“Down here? You couldn’t get a 
guard to the hydroponics levels un- 
less you bribed him.’’ Katuki 
thought for a moment. “I don’t 
think I’ve seen one on this level for 
three months. Provided everything 
runs smoothly here, we’re left to 
ourselves. Here’s to you.’’ 

Waldo lifted his glass, expecting 
the worst, and gulped it down. He’d 
thought it would be near-beer, or 
rot-gut. It turned out to be high- 

116 



proof, top quality bourbon. The 
others grinned at his obvious sur- 
prise. 

“Not bad, eh, Waldo?’’ said 
Katuki. “I tell you, we do all right 
for ourselves down here. Know how 
we do it?’’ 

Waldo accepted a second glass 
and thought for a moment. Obvious- 
ly, they’d found a way to make or 
smuggle good booze. He didn’t 
want to get involved in what might 
be a risky operation. On the other 
hand, he certainly didn’t want to be 
cut off from the supply. This 
needed a careful answer. 

“Mr. Katuki, when a lawyer is 
asked if he was given a piece of in- 
formation he’s legally obliged to 
answer, yes or no. But he can’t be 
asked what he or somebody else 
was thinking. So to answer your 
question. I’d rather not be told 
where the drink comes from.” 

There was a baffled silence for a 
few seconds as the gears ground in- 
side Katuki’s bullet head. Then his 
face lit up. “Hey, I like that.” He 
turned to the others. “See how to 
do it. No talk, no chance to get 
caught out.’’ Then to Waldo. 
“You’ll get the picture for yourself 
soon enough, when we look around 
the works tomorrow.” 

The next day wasn’t so good. 
Despite Katuki’s pride in the set-up, 
the three hydroponics levels were a 
bit stark. They began with the algae 
breeding tanks on the third level, 
where the big vats were cultured for 
the seeders. 



GALAXY 



“We pipe ’em to Station Down 
as soon as they’re ready,’’ ex- 
plained Katuki. “Then the seeders 
spray the algae out into the upper 
atmosphere. They convert carbon 
dioxide to oxygen as they fall, and 
die when it gets too hot for them. 
Each time we go over the same spot 
on the ground, the algae get a bit 
lower before they’re crisped. It’s al- 
ready a couple of degrees cooler 
down on the surface than it was 
when the project started.” 

Waldo suppressed a yawn. 
Technology bored him. They went 
down a staircase to the second level 
and then along a corridor that led to 
the second level hydroponics tanks. 
Katuki had got a little more Jumpy, 
excited about something. He kept 
glancing at Waldo as though in an- 
ticipation. 

“Don’t ever touch that red lever 
on the wall unless I tell you,” he 
warned as they came halfway along 
the corridor. “It opens up a section 
of the floor, so we can dump chem- 
icals into the channel on the first 
level.” 

“What’s in the channel?” 

“Partly treated sewage, on its 
way through the lowest level hy- 
droponics tanks. You wouldn’t 
drown if you fell down there — it’s 
only waist-deep. I don’t think you’d 
enjoy it, though.” 

They walked on, Waldo treading 
very gingerly as they went over the 
trapdoor section of the corridor. Just 
before the staircase to the lowest 
level Katuki stopped and looked 

DINSDALE DISSENTS 



into a small room on the left. It was 
filled with long spirals of silver 
coils, winding halfway to the ceil- 
ing. It looked curiously familiar. As 
they came down the staircase and 
out to the lowest level hydroponics, 
Waldo had a sudden insight. 

A still. That’s what those metal 
coils had to be, and that’s where the 
liquor was coming from. As they 
walked past the fronded, blue-green 
plants of the long hydroponics tank 
he noticed that Katuki was looking 
at him with a sly, expectant air. 
Waldo winked and Katuki grinned 
back at him. 

“We don’t need to talk about it, 
right, Waldo?” he said. “A wink’s 
as good as a nod to a blind horse.” 
They moved out along the first 
level catwalk, with the big hy- 
droponics tank on their left. A 
broad stream of grey-green sewage, 
with beaded bubbles winking at the 
brim, moved sluggishly past on the 
right. Katuki noticed Waldo’s ex- 
pression and grinned again. 

“That’s where you finish up if 
you fall through the second level 
trapdoor. Don’t make any enemies 
among the other vatmen, Waldo.” 
Waldo looked again at the steam- 
ing mess and shuddered. His appe- 
tite for dinner dropped a notch. 

After a month he had the working 
routine mastered, but his taste for 
the Job didn’t increase. As far as 
Waldo was concerned, a vatman’s 
lot was not a happy one. Apart 
from Katuki, the vatmen were 
near-morons and a grunt passed for 

117 



sparkling conversation. What with 
filtering, stirring, removing sludge 
and adding chemicals, Waldo had 
lost ten kilos and was beginning to 
regard a human being as no more 
than an instrument for recycling 
sewage. That was a pity, because 
the vatmen under Katuki’s direction 
dined — and wined — amazingly well. 
The third level of tanks were dedi- 
cated to producing algae for the 
seeders, and the lowest level next to 
the bottom sewage channel was 
used for oxygen production. But 
part of the tank on the second level 
had been set up as a kitchen garden 
and produced excellent vegetables. 

There was not much real meat. 
Waldo could see no way round that, 
except maybe cannibalism. As he 
got to know Katuki better that 
seemed less improbable. Behind the 
tough battered face lay an even 
tougher inside. The crews did just 
what he told them, with no argu- 
ments and no discussion. Waldo fol- 
lowed the same approach himself. 
His work was mainly on the lowest 
level tank, where Katuki seemed to 
think he was exceptionally reliable. 
It wasn’t easy. Katuki had been so 
impressed by Waldo’s remark on 
the virtues of silent accord that his 
instructions had become almost un- 
intelligible, delivered through iso- 
lated words and a series of nods, 
grunts and winks. But since he 
clearly continued to regard Waldo 
with special esteem, everything 
must have been going well. And as 
Katuki had said, the guards much 

118 



preferred the upper levels of Station 
Up, where the gravity and the sew- 
age were less noticeable. Waldo 
hadn’t seen one down on the lowest 
levels since his arrival, and his fears 
regarding the condensing coils of 
the still off the second level corridor 
had greatly eased. 

You have to remember that I’m 
reporting Waldo’s version of events, 
plus a few things that came out 
after the visit of the Space Federa- 
tion VIP’s to Venus Station. So it’s 
very possible that Waldo was not 
quite the popular, respected figure 
that he describes. Be that as it may, 
one day Katuki came rushing down 
to Waldo’s room for advice and as- 
sistance. He was so worried that his 
speech had become quite normal. 

“Waldo, we got a bad problem 
coming up,” he said. “Next week’s 
the tenth anniversary of the terra- 
forming {jroject. President Dinsdale 
and a whole bunch of VIP’s are 
coming here for a big ceremony in 
Station Down — special algal spray- 
ing, banquet, everything. Trouble 
is, they’ll be coming to Station Up 
as well, to give us a big inspec- 
tion.” 

It was nice to receive Katuki’s 
comments in words rather than in 
mime. Waldo could see no reason 
for the big panic, though. 

“Don’t worry about it, Katuki. 
He’s not called Dandy Dinsdale for 
nothing, you know. I’ve seen him 
before. He wears thousand-credit 
suits and he changes his clothes five 
times a day. He has his own barber 

GALAXY 



and his own manicurist. He can’t 
stand dirt or filth in any form — it’s 
a mania with him. I’m telling you, 
you’ll never get Dinsdale within six 
levels of the vat areas.” 

“Waldo, he don’t know what it’s 
like here. He asked to see every- 
thing, and that dumb superintendent 
took him at his word. Rusty up in 
the guard block showed me the tour 
plan and it includes all our levels.” 
Katuki paced up and down Waldo’s 
room, two steps each way, then 
hammered his fist on the steel bulk- 
head. “Damn it, Waldo, what use 
is a prison if you can’t keep the 
wrong people out of it?” 

While Katuki was talking, Waldo’s 
stomach had moved steadily up his 
throat and was now pushing at the 
roof of his. mouth. That damned 
still! It would be the ruin of all of 
them. Why had he been fool 
enough to let a few bottles of liquor 
get him mixed up in another illegal 
deal? Why hadn’t he stayed out or 
blown the whistle? 

Because he’d heard Katuki’s 
views on the way you deal with 
squealers and double-crossers, that’s 
why. Waldo had the feeling that 
he’d been predestined for this set- 
up, ever since the Judge had said 
the words Venus Station. Katuki 
was still airing his woes. “They 
want me to go over to Station 
Down and explain the way we feed 
the algal seeders. That means I 
can’t be here to steer the tour the 
way I’d like to. I’ll rush back over 
here as soon as I can, but I can’t

rely on one of those other dummies 
to show Dinsdale and the other 
brass round here. Christ, can you 
imagine Blattwitz or Grapelli lead- 
ing the tour? It’s taken me two 
years to teach those two to wash up 
before they come through for din- 
ner. Waldo, it has to be you. You’ll 
have to make sure the visitors only 
see what we want them to see. 
You’ll do it, right?” 

Waldo began to appreciate the 
narrowness of the beach between 
the devil and the deep blue sea. He 
was stuck with it. 

“Right.” He thought of the old 
advice to the woman being raped: 
relax. 

“Then I’ll make sure we have 
tour signs put up, to make it as easy 
for you as we can,” Katuki went 
on. “People always follow arrows, 
even off a cliff. That’s where I’d 
like to send that pansy Dinsdale. 
Damned troublemaker, why wouldn’t 
he settle for a banquet like anybody 
else?” 

Katuki had real venom in his 
tone. Waldo realized that Katuki ’s 
dislike of President Dinsdale went 
well beyond a difference of political 
opinions. 

★ ★ ★ 

They spent most of the next few 
days scrubbing everything in sight, 
preparing for the big tour. When 
President Dinsdale finally appeared 
on the third hydroponics level, 
however, surrounded by a retinue of 



VIP’s, it was clear that the cleaning 
efforts hadn’t been sufficient. Wal- 
do’s predictions had been on the 
mark. Dinsdale, impeccably dressed 
and coiffured, was holding a fine 
silk handkerchief close to his nose, 
and his expression left no doubt as 
to his feelings. The superintendent 
handed the tour over to Waldo with 
obvious relief. Dinsdale’s great dis- 
dain had penetrated even the 
superintendent’s bovine brain. As 
they walked along the third level, 
Waldo babbled anything that hap- 
pened to come into his head. He 
was preparing himself for the detour 
that would have to be made down 
on the second level, to by-pass the 
still. 

Fortunately, President Dinsdale 
showed no interest in anything at all 
beyond his handkerchief. A couple 
of the others, though, were looking 
about them keenly and seemed to 
understand what they were seeing. 
Waldo led them nervously to the 
second level staircase, following the 
arrows that Katuki had set out. 

As they came out into the second 
level corridor Waldo stopped, un- 
able to believe his eyes. Instead of 
diverting them down to the lowest 
level, the arrows were pointing 
along the corridor, straight past the 
still. 

The group was passing Waldo, 
blindly following the arrows, before 
he could get his brain working. 
They had reached the trapdoor and 
in two more seconds would be able 
to see the still. 



120 



GALAXY 



At that precise moment, Waldo 
had a sudden flash of total insight, 
an apocalyptic vision of truth. 
Katuki, in his hatred of President 
Dinsdale, didn’t care whether they 
saw the still or not. He was plan- 
ning to kidnap Dinsdale and hold 
the party hostages. Why else would 
he let the secret of the still be re- 
vealed? 

In moments of great stress, the 
body moves faster than the brain. 
While Waldo was still dithering 
mentally, his legs moved him over 
to the corridor wall. His hands, un- 
prompted, pulled the red lever. The 
trapdoor swung open, and President 
Dinsdale and his entourage disap- 
peared with a chorus of screams. 

Waldo advanced to the edge of 
the pit, unsure what to do next. His 
sudden vision of absolute truth 
hadn’t given him a follow-up act. 
He dithered on the brink, noting ab- 
sently that all of the party with the 
exception of Dinsdale himself had 
managed to land feet-first in the 
sewage channel below. The Presi- 
dent had eventually regained his 
footing, but he had suffered a sea- 
change into something undeniably 
strange and overpoweringly rich. He 
had lost his handkerchief along the 
way. 

As Waldo hesitated, Katuki sud- 
denly appeared at the second-level 
staircase on the other side of the 
trapdoor. He was carrying a heavy 
wrench in his hand. “Dirty 
double-crosser,” he shouted, and 
ran towards Waldo. Waldo turned 



to flee, but another vatman was 
coming the other way, a heavy iron 
pipe in his hand and a murderous 
expression on his face. Waldo’s 
problem of what to do next seemed 
to be solved. 

With a moan of anticipation, 
he flung himself backwards through 
the trapdoor and immersed himself 
in his work. 

In due course, the lowest level’s 
ever-rolling silent stream bore 
Waldo, President Dinsdale and the 
rest of them along into the lowest 
hydroponics area, where they were 
able to climb out onto the catwalk 
beside the big tank full of blue- 
green vegetation. Waldo was the 
last to arrive, and had expected a 
certain amount of commotion to 
greet him. But the reality exceeded 
his wildest imaginings. He had 
never heard anything like it. 

★ ★ ★ 

Waldo didn’t mention that he had 
saved President Dinsdale from being 
captured and held hostage? That’s 
not too surprising. You see, it just 
wasn’t true. The trouble with 
apocalyptic visions is that they often 
won’t withstand a rational examina- 
tion. Waldo’s wild surmise about 
Katuki’s intentions seemed to make 
sense to him at the time. Why else 
would Katuki let the still be seen? 

The trouble was, it wasn’t a still 
at all. If Waldo had known as much 
science as the average ten-year-old, 
he’d have realized that those coils 



DINSDALE DISSENTS 



121 




were just part of the standard water 
recycling equipment on the Station. 
The thing that Katuki didn’t want 
the visitors to see, and the thing 
that he was sure Waldo wouldn’t let 
them see, was the lowest level hy- 
droponics tank. 

Katuki had misinterpreted Wal- 
do’s wink when they had taken their 
first tour. As Waldo said, just 
because you've seen a piece of 
cheese doesn’t mean you’d 
recognize a cow if you saw one. 
The thing that so excited the visitors 
who had been plunged through the 
trapdoor — with the exception of 
Dinsdale, who had his own 
preoccupations — was the lowest 
level hydroponics tank. 

The healthy vegetation there, 
producing oxygen for the use in the 
Station, was also producing — under 
Katuki’s guiding hand — four acres 
of top-quality taliza plants, for 
shipment to Earth in return for 
liquor and other luxuries. Waldo’s 
own knowledge of botany, as a 
deep hypnoprobe verified, stops at 
mixed vegetables. 

Waldo was given an award by the 
grateful Space Federation for break- 
ing the taliza ring. And Katuki’s re- 
peated attempts to get to Waldo dur- 
ing the trial and kill him with his 
bare hands proved pretty conclu- 
sively that Waldo had never had 
any part of the dmg ring. But evi- 
dence or no evidence, Waldo never 
during the course of the whole trial 
received anything but a negative 
vote from President Dinsdale. ★

THE BOOK OF STEPHEN FABIAN 



THE VERDICT IS IN ON THE BEST OF STEPHEN 
FABIAN. 

Here is what the tritics have said about the first col- 
lection from the pen and brush of this dazzling artist! 



"You can’t flip the pages of Galaxy with your 
eves open and fail to notice that Fabian is great . 
There are 50 plates in this . folio ... All arc superb 
. and the repro is as good as that in THE FANTAS- 
TIC ART OF FRANK FRAZETTA. 

"It's available . only by writing Loompanics 
Unlimited . $12.50 a hit. Worth it, by me.” 

-Spider Robinson, Galaxy 



“Fabian is my kind of artist ... It was a real treat 
to look thru his Loompanics artfolio. It made my 
day." -Forrest ]. Ackerman 

“Loompanics Unlimited has published THE BEST 
OF STEPHEN FABIAN . The book presents 35 of 
Steve’s best previously-published work plus 15 origi- 
nal drawings done especially for this book . The 
fact that I own 6 of the 50 drawings should say some- 
thing about my feelings for the art. Steve is a fantas- 
tic talent and my only regrets about this book are it is 
too short, and that I do not own all the 50 drawings!" 

—Stuart David Schiff, Whispers 



"I say the Loompanics book . provides a wide 
range of Steve’s styles and skills, including quite a few 
previously unpublished full-pagers." 

—Richard E. Geis (Alter Ego), Science Fiction Review 



"Where has the sense of wonder gone from sf art? 
A healthy chunk of it can be found in THE BEST OF 
STEPHEN FABIAN, published by Loompanics Un- 
limited. 

"The book is . beautifully printed on one side 
of fine heavy slock . 

’’. many of the plates are presented consider- 
ably larger than they originally appeared . But Fa- 
bian is one of the few illustrators whose work doesn’t 
suffer from being seen full si/c. In the 50 plates 
including 15 ncver-before-published pieces done es- 
pecially for this volume-hc demonstrates an admir- 
able and enviable technique, a strong sense of drama, 
a contrasting but balanced delicacy and strength in 
his rendering, and a superb feel for the genre. 

"Probably more than any other black-and-white 
illustrator presently working in the sf magazine field, 
Fabian has the power to revive the excitement that 
was so much the appeal of the old pulps. He’d have 
been quite at home in the pages of Weird Tates and 
would have held his own in the company of the best. 

"His art is immediate and arresting and often un- 
forgettable . .Many an author has wished for better 
illustrators; on many occasions Fabian’s work has de- 
served better authors. 

". .. Stephen Fabian’s art is admirably suited to 
the subject matter it illustrates. THE BEST OF STE- 
PHEN FABIAN Is a beautiful book, and a fine tribute 
to a deserving talent." 

—George Barr, Delap's F & SF Review 




THE BEST OF STEPHEN FABIAN contains f/T/y of 
this brilliant artist’s finest drawings from Galaxy, If, 
Whispers, The Occult Lovecraft, Amazing, Fantastic, 
The Miscast Barbarian, Outworlds, and more, more, 
more . Including fifteen never before published 
drawings, done especially for this book. 

Each drawing is printed on one side of 8/2 x 1 1 80 lb.

CAN TRASH SAVE US? 



Larry niven used to live behind a 
garbage dump. Yon wouldn’t have 
known it, of course; although his 
sister used to say he lived Jn the 
“wrong part” of BelAire, it is not 
characteristic of that fabled com- 
munity that it be in any way notice- 
able that the municipal sanitary land 
fill — read garbage dump — is only 
about half a mile up the street. On 
the other hand, the access road to 
the dump is clearly visible from the 
San Diego Freeway, and when I 
drove to Larry’s house — which was 
pretty often back in the days when 
we were writing The Mote in God’s 
Eye and Inferno — I couldn’t help 
seeing the endless stream of huge 
trucks trundling up into the Santa 
Monica Mountains with their loads 
of refuse. 

Surely, thought I, we ought to be 
able to do something with that stuff 
besides bury it in what might 

124 



otherwise be a very nice wilderness 
area. Couple that memory (Larry 
lives elsewhere now, so I don’t go 
past there so often) with Jim Baen’s 
persuasive manner (“Why the hell 
don’t you write a column on how to 
rearrange the world so we don’t 
waste so much? Get at it, blast 
you!”) and you have the reason for 
this column. Frankly, as I start I 
don’t have the foggiest notion of 
what I’ll conclude. 

Those who would save the world 
seem to do so in waves. There are 
fads in the eco-crusading business, 
and just now garbage is the big one. 
I say fad because the 1 974 opus put 
out by the people who brought you 
the Whole Earth Catalogue, namely 
their An Index of Possibilities: 
Energy and Power, contains not a 
single index reference to “trash,” 
“garbage,” “waste,” or “sew- 
age,” and only one tiny reference 

GALAXY 



(under “methane”) to use of any of 
these materials; yet it was supposed 
to be a compendium of all the ideas 
on how the energy crisis might be 
solved. Now, however, you can’t 
pick up a work of that sort without 
finding article after article on how 
we could be saved if only we’d use 
the energy in our sewage and gar- 
'' bage. Unfortunately, none of the ar- 
' tides I’ve seen give any numbers, 
they’re very similar to the wistful 
thoughts I had while driving to Lar- 
ry’s house. There’s so much waste 
and trash that surely we can get a 
5 lot of energy out of it; can’t we? 

£ I don’t know. Let’s see. 



Let’s begin by looking at the 
• present energy situation. That turns 
out not to be as easy as you might 
f think; the data aren’t collected to- 
gether into one place, and even 
when you find the figures they’re 
I all mixed up. It takes a lot of pa- 
( tience and determination to come up 
t with a meaningful composite, 
f Energy analysts don’t seem ever 
c to have heard of the metric system, 
f Everything is given in terms of 
V British Thermal Units, or tons of 
I coal equivalent (and not everybody 
t has a common figure on how many 
I Btu there are in a ton of coal) or 
\ barrels of oil per day (ditto about 
I Btu/bbl.) or kiloWatt-hours, or 
i whatever they’re enamored of. 

I’ve put together as good a pic- 
^ ture as I can, and I’ve converted 
; everything into ergs (I grew up with 

■ the cgs system; if you like the mks 
y system, divide by 10^; if you like 
' feet and pounds, get hep). The re- 

■ suits are given in Tables One and 

t A STEP FARTHER OUT 



Two, which show where the US 
energy comes from and where it 
goes. 

Now true: the growth projected 
in Table One makes a number 
of assumptions which T haven’t 
bothered to list (it assumes a con- 
stant real increase in GNP, for 
example) and the percentages in 
Table Two are going to change if 
the US population continues stable; 
but at least we’ve got something to 
work with, a way to see just how 
big a problem we’re facing. 

Now that we know how much 
power we need, let’s find out how 
much garbage we have to deal with. 
Actually I shouldn’t use the term 
“garbage” with its strong negative 
connotation; as the authors of the 
energy from waste section of 
Annual Review of Energy for 1976 
point out, it’s precisely that term that 
makes the most talented adminis- 
trators avoid the municipal depart- 
ments of sanitation, and makes 
waste-collection a job at the very 
lowest end of the social scale. In- 
stead I suppose I should say “urban 
physical resources” or some such. 
Anyway, we need to know how 
much of it we have to work with. 

The Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), which hasn’t heard 
of the metric system either, guesses 
that we produce about 3.32 pounds 
per capita each day (1.51 kg for the 
more up to date among us). Look- 
ing at my own household that seems 
about right. The figure refers to 
municipal wastes, which is every- 
thing thrown away such as trash and 
garbage, but does not include sew- 
age. Since there are about 250 mil- 
lion of us, we get a rough figure of 
415 thousand tons each day, or 15

million tons each year, which prob- 
ably explains why the cities are 
running out of sanitary land fill. In 
metric terms we have 38 thousand 
metric tons or 13.7 million tonnes 
annually — still a respectable sum. 
We’ll stay with the English system 
for a while because the energy figures 
I have for what we can get out of 
municipal waste are, of course, 
given in Btu/ton. Sigh. 

Incidentally, the Annual Review 
article also gives an estimate of 250 
million tons municipal waste daily, 
of which 175 million is domestic; 



and that simply can’t be right. It 
may include sewage, which we’ll 
deal with separately. But better than 
a ton per person per day is still far 
too large. 

All right: we have this incredible 
pile of waste, now what can we do 
with it? Well, if it were dry we 
could burn it, with due regard to 
cleaning up the stack gasses to 
avoid pollution; and in fact that’s 
what’s done with a lot of it (and 
sometimes without worrying about 
the pollution aspects, either). Few 
places make any effort to capture

the energy from that burning waste. 
The stuff is merely incinerated to 
reduce the volume. Surely there is a 
significant amount of energy re- 
leased, though, and if we can tap it, 
will we be independent of Arab 
sheiks and Liberian tankers? 

The standard figure for the 
energy content of municipal waste 
is about 10 million Btu per ton, but 
there’s a joker: that’s per ton of dry 
weight. Unfortunately, a lot of 
municipal waste is anything but dry, 
and it takes a good bit of energy to 
get the water out of it before it will 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



bum at all. Still, let’s assume we’ve 
dried it, somehow, and it’s all ours. 

We cannot yet burn it in steam 
boilers. The stuff consists of all 
kinds of things: discarded metal 
beds; tin cans; old Six Million Dol- 
lar Man toys; food scraps; dead 
animals; discarded vacuum cleaners; 
coffee grounds; and you name it. It 
must be pulverized and sorted, and 
that takes energy. It also takes 
either a very high or a very low 
technology: that is, one way to sort 
it is by human labor, but we’d 
probably have to increase the size 

127 



of the army before we could put the 
unemployed to work doing that; 
thus we have to build highly sophis- 
ticated equipment, with magnets, 
grates, air-stream sorters and the 
like, and those cost money, and 
municipalities raise money primarily 
through property taxes, and home- 
owners are about ready to revolt al- 
ready. But let’s assume all those 
problems solved and we’ve done the 
sorting. How much energy can we 
get from our rubbish? 

Comes now the math; tons times 
energy/ton times a mess of con- 
stants I won’t bother to give. The 
results are interesting: 1.6 x 10^® 
ergs, or 4.4 x 10" kiloWatt-hours. 
In other words, if we captured all 
the energy from our rubbish we 
could produce about 2% of the 
energy we used in 1974. Signifi- 
cant, yes. Important, perhaps. But it 
won’t save us from Arab oil and 
sinking tankers. 

Alas, things are worse than that. 
No industrial process is 100% effi- 
cient, and electrical generation is no 
exception. With present technology 
the best we’ve been able to do at 
burning rubbish is 27% efficiency, 
which means that if all our munici- 
pal waste were burned in the best 
boilers we know how to build, we’d 
get 1.2 X 10" kW-hrs, or, coinci- 
dentally, some 2% of the electricity 
generated in 1974 — and we have 
not counted in costs, the energy 
needed to process and dry, or in- 
deed much of anything. 

We could go another way. If we 
can persuade industries to build 
alongside the rubbish-disposal sys- 
tem or take the rubbish to their 
plants, so that we can use the steam 
directly without turning it into elec- 

128 



tricity, we get 66% of the energy 
value and that’s a respectable 7% of 
all the process steam used in 1974; 
well worth trying for, if it doesn’t 
cost too much. 

So. What are the costs of all this? 
The Annual Review gives some fig- 
ures, which I have recalculated to 
give Table Three. (1 recalculated be- 
cause theirs were based on plants 
processing 275 tons unsorted refuse 
per day, an awkward figure at best.) 
They still don’t mean very much; is 
this a low or a high cost? Well, one 
figure readily available is the capital 
cost per installed kilo Watt of elec- 
trical power. That ranges from 
around $500 for a coal-fired plant to 
over $1000 for some kinds of nu- 
clear. 

Assuming 27% efficiency for a 
refuse-burning electrical plant, we 
find the capital cost per kW is 
$1103: much higher than other 
kinds of plant costs, which explains 
why electrical utilities aren’t terribly 
interested. For $1100 a kW they 
can buy a nuclear breeder plant, 
whose operating costs will be lower 
than the value of the fuel produced. 

I suspect that my figures for nuclear 
power costs are a bit low; theylre 
based on research done a couple of 
years ago, and the court and 
environmental impact statement 
costs of nuclear power are now 
about as high as the costs of the 
hardware; but even so, the refuse- 
plant generator is expensive. 

Or is it? After all, the cities have 
to get rid of the refuse somehow. If 
we subtract off the costs of sanitary 
land fill, and a number of the other 
expenses of disposing of that grow- 
ing mound of trash that gives 
mayors nightmares, our electrical

plants begin to make sense after all: 
but only if we look at cities as a 
' total system, and city budgets aren’t 
, prepared that way. Believe me, I 
; know: I’ve been Executive Assistant 
to the Mayor of Los Angeles. The 
Department of Water and Power 
would scream bloody blue blazes if 
: told they had to spend that kind of 
. money; while many of DWP’s 
- senior administrators, people you 
I can’t do without, would go job- 
f hunting if told their lordly depart- 
t ment was to be combined with Sani- 
V tation. Moreover, the City Council 
I would impeach anyone suggesting 
i the kind of capital fund raising (and 
( consequent increase in property 
[ taxes) a large-scale electricity- 
« from-rubbish project would require, 
j Still, if we were starting over — if 
' we could look at cities as total sys- 

r A STEP FARTHER OUT 




terns rather than as a series of inde- 
pendent departments — it would 
make a great deal of sense to get rid 
of our refuse and extract the energy 
out of it at the same time. We could 
not run the city on its own garbage, 
nor is garbage a particularly effi- 
cient way to get electricity; but 
since you have to get rid of the 
stuff anyway, you might as well 
take out what you can, and the total 
system costs will probably Justify 
the initial capital expense. 

Whether, given what we’ve al- 
ready spent on sanitation facilities, it 
makes much sense is not so obvi- 
ous: you have to look at each city 
independently. I suspect that LA 
could sell the land set aside for 
sanitary land fill (another depart- 
ment heard from: although Recrea- 
tion and Parks knows it can’t keep 

129 



that land forever, right now they’re 
not turning loose) for enough to 
build some good-sized plants; but I 
haven’t done the numbers. In places 
where land values are not so high as 
here, it’s more dubious. 

Let’s leave rubbish for a bit and 
get down in the sewers. If garbage 
can’t provide more than a fraction 
of our energy needs, can sewage 
save us? 

« ★ * 

To begin with, sewage is valu- 
able. That should be obvious: it is 
only the very wealthy western na- 
tions that can afford to throw away 
such a valuable resource. Indeed, 
we spend a lot of money and energy 
merely to throw it away — after 
which we burn a lot of valuable 
coal and oil to generate electricity 
in order to fix nitrogen to make 
fertilizer — fertilizer that’s not as 
good as the high-nitrogen sewage 
we pollute rivers with. 

Secondly, there’s a long techno- 
logical history of using sewage 
as a fuel source: begin with the 
Indian peasant who uses buffalo 
chips to cook his food and procede 
to modem methane generators. 

Finally, even if we don’t use 
sewage as fertilizer — and thus by- 
pass the long series of inefficiencies 
involved in the generation and 
transmission of power, fixation of 
nitrogen, etc., culminating in com- 
mercial fertilizer — the stuff has a 
high energy content. 

In other words, using sewage as 
an energy source has a lot going for 
it. There are several ways to go. 

First, as agricultural nutrient, al- 
lowing the crop to be the actual 

130 



energy-storage system. This is 
widely done in the Orient, with det- 
rimental side effects: the honey- 
bucket is a pretty effective means of 
spreading epidemics. Surely we can 
do better than that. 

Second, as methane source: 
shovel sewage into a tank, let fer- 
ment in the absence of air, and out 
comes methane. Methane is also 
known as natural gas, and is rather 
valuable. Indeed, natural gas is the 
most critically short item in our 
energy budget. A pound of dry 
sewage solid will produce about 3 
to 5 cubic feet of methane, which 
sells at $3.53 per 100 cubic meters. 
Now my source book, with a 
straight face, gives both those fig- 
ures in the same paragraph. I’ll 
translate: a ton of sewage produces 
some 225 cubic meters of methane, 
worth about $8.00. The methane 
production pretty well sterilizes the 
residual, which can then be used as 
high-nitrogen fertilizer. (But we will 
have to use some of the methane as 
fuel for drying it before we can sell 
it.) 

Finally, we can produce the 
methane and then bum the residual. 
It has been calculated that doing 
that will let us build a system that 
operates at zero profit provided that 
we charge about $5.50 a ton dump 
fee: that is, those who wish to dis- 
pose of sewage must pay us. 

Why is this? We’re getting valu- 
able fuel out of the system; surely 
we need not charge a dump fee? 
Ah, but the plant itself costs a lot of 
money, and that money isn’t free. 
IF the plant already existed, it 
would make a profit — but the 
“profit” is lower than current inter- 
est rates, and thus the dump fee: 

GAIAXY 



another of the little points usually 
forgotten by those who are fad- 
dishly out to save the world. Of 
course, if the price of methane were 
deregulated the system would be 
clearly profitable; exactly how pro- 
fitable would depend on how much 
of the gas produced would have to 
be returned to the system as operat- 
ing energy. 

Furthermore, technology im- 
proves, and one commercial utility. 
Southern California Edison, was at 
one time trying to find ways to use 
sewage as fuel; they contracted to 
take the entire sewage output of one 
of the smaller southern California 
cities free and get rid of it by burning 
it in their boilers. They didn’t quite 
know how to make that work, but 
they were doing the research, when 
along came the Public Utilities 
Commission to tell them to stop. It 
seems that wasn’t a justifiable use 
of the rate-payers’ money. Utilities 
shouldn’t engage in fuel research, 
they should generate power. Thus 
we were all protected by our 
government, and now a government 
agency will have to do the neces- 
sary research if sewage is to be 
burned at a profit. 

Still, Just how much energy could 
we get from this source? Well, each 
of us produces about .25 pounds 
(yeah, I know, but all the other 
numbers I could find were in the 
English system and I give up) of 
dry solid each day. That’s 11 mil- 
lion tons a year; if it all went into 
methane generation systems we’d 
get 90 billion cubic feet of methane 
annually, and at 994.7 Btu per 
cubic foot that’s 9.6 x 10^® ergs or 
0.19% (2 tenths of a percent) of the 
1974 energy budget. Sigh. It’s un- 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 




likely to save us, isn’t it? However, 
don’t despair. We can also add the 
animal wastes, which amount to 
some 25 million tons a year, and 
get up to 2000 billion cubic feet of 
methane, 2.1 x 10^® ergs, or 2.6% 
of all energy used in 1974. Better 
than that, it’s just about 10% of the 
energy we obtained from natural gas 
in 1974 — ie., we could cut natural 
gas consumption by 10% a year — 
and natural gas is, as mentioned, 
the most critically short item in our 
energy mix. 

It’s not the earth, but it’s some- 
thing. 

Of course it’s also expensive, and 
technologically some time away. 
What I’ve given are some maximum 
theoretical figures, not what we 
could do tomorrow morning if we 
set our minds to it. 



131 



★ ★ ★ 



Let’s see: 2% from human and 
animal sewage; another 2% from 
municipal refuse; add in another 
percentage point just in case: and 
we’ve come up with a grand total of 
5% of the 1974 energy budget, pro- 
vided that we can use ALL of the 
energy from our sewage and gar- 
bage and other trash. Since we can- 
not possibly capture 100% of that 
energy, I leave it to you to guess at 
the actual efficiencies; and I think 
you now see why engineers, as op- 
posed to faddists, don’t think we 
can run the United States on its own 
garbage heaps. 

That doesn’t mean the energies in 
our waste aren’t worth recovering. 
It’s particularly true in the case of 
animal wastes: methane generators 
aren’t very sensitive to scale. Once 
you get up to a couple of tons a 
day, larger methane cookers don’t 
cost much less per pound processed. 
Thus quite small operations could 
.feasibly build them; and, like gar- 
bage, both animal and human 
wastes must be disposed of anyway , 
and dairies ought to be encouraged 
(through higher sewage fees and the 
like) to catch that energy and feed it 
into the national pipeline. Once 
again, though, each case must be 
examined individually: distance to 
pipeline; availability of water 
(methane cookers take lots of wa- 
ter); and other such factors enter 
here. 

But having done it, we haven t 
saved ourselves. 

* ★ ★ 

If we got 5% of the 1974 energy 
132 



budget from sewage and garbage 
(which we can’t, because 5% comes 
only with 100% efficiency), we’d 
still have to depend on Arab oil. 
What else can we do? 

Not too long ago there was in 
vogue a scheme to grow crops for 
alcohol and run much of our trans- 
port system on that. It was even 
worked out quite elaborately: take 
sewage and transport it (means not 
specified) out to marginal farm- 
lands; take the urban poor off the 
welfare rolls and give them small- 
holdings of that marginal land; and 
let them grow alcohol crops, thus 
relieving unemployment, getting 
people out of the cities, and solving 
the energy crisis — as well as dealing 
with sewage. 

It sounds good. It sounds marvel- 
ous. Why don’t we do it? 

Well, alas, there are some prob- 
lems. For one, many of those urban 
poor have just come to the city 
from marginal farms on which they 
couldn’t make a living. It might re- 
quire a larger police force and army 
than we have to make them go 
back. But leave that. Let’s assume 
we have the labor force or can get 
it. 

What crops produce the most al- 
cohol? You already know that: com 
(maize, as they call it everywhere 
but in the USA); wheat; barley; in 
other words, cash crops. If they 
grow well they’ll be grown: gone 
are the days of our big farm 
surpluses. Also, they are all crops 
which respond best to agro-business 
techniques: there are enormous 
economies of scale. It doesn’t cost 
anywhere near a thousand times as 
much to keep 40,000 acres in culti- 
vation as it does to keep 40 going. 

GALAXY 



Then there are the costs of collec- 
tion. The alcohol must be trans- 
ported and distributed: first, though, 
the crops themselves must be car- 
ried around to the fermenting vats 
(since the costs of providing each 
form, or small community of farms, 
with its own generation facility 
would be collossal); then the result- 
ing alcohol must be piped to where 
it will be used. 

Also note that all of this is in 
competition with food crops. True: 
the United States probably could, at 
hideous capital costs, grow enough 
alcohol to run its transport system, 
and thus be free or nearly so of im- 
ported petroleum. We could even 
afford to do it. It would have one 
monstrous side effect, though: as 
we are now one of the few food- 
exporting countries of this world, 
we could condemn a lot of people 
to starvation. I suspect that the very 
ones who now clamor for our energy- 
independence achieved through crop- 
lands growing alcohol would be 
the first to denounce such callous 
behavior. 

But: it is in precisely this area 
that research can be made to pay 
off. Right now growing plants are 
very inefficient things. They don’t 
really convert much (1% or so) of 
the sunlight falling on them into 
useful energy. Over the millenia 
man has selectively bred some 
plants (such as maize, wheat, bar- 
ley, etc.) to do a much better job 
than most; now molecular biology 
may allow us to double that effi- 
ciency in a few years. 

Then, too, the system for generat- 
ing methane produees a very high 
grade fertilizer, with not only ni- 
trates but also phosphates, trace 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



elements, and the other ingredients 
missing from marginal farmland. 
Thus we have a potential for up- 
grading marginal land, which will 
attract unhappy city dwellers to a 
rural life. Whether the upgraded 
land is best used to grow alcohol 
crops for fuel, or to grow food for 
the world, is an economic decision 
that would have to be made at the 
time; but clearly it will be useful. 

The potential is enormous. If we 
had 3% efficient crops and grew 
them continuously, then some 2% 
of the US land area would provide 
fuel for all our electrical generators: 
25% of all the energy we use, and 
this without fusion or plutonium or 
coal or oil. Well worth continuing 
research, and you may recall that a 
year or so ago I discussed the need 
for a national “Manhattan Project’’ 
in plant efficiencies. It’s still 
needed. The development of more 
efficient agricultural plants would 
do more towards solving the energy 
problem than all the solar towers 
and windmills we’ll ever build. 

★ ★ ★ 

Finally, what does it all mean? 
I’m tempted to give Mr. Natural’s 
answer, but I won’t. 

What it means is this: there aren’t 
any simple answers to our energy 
problem. No magic solutions. No 
fads. No mysterious “them” who 
prevent us from solving all our 
problems with a few tricks. 

What it takes is high technology 
and a lot of research: neither of 
which looks too healthy right now, 
given our tax laws. It takes capital 
accumulation, incentives, a chop- 
ping away of bureaucratic red tape. 



133 



I’ve covered a lot of that in previ- 
ous essays. 

I don’t want to leave this before 
making one point that glared at me 
out of the research I did for this ar- 
ticle. Were I energy czar of the US, 

I know what I’d do (I think — after 
all. I’ve only taken a first cut). 

Our transport system uses a full 
quarter of all energy, and 80% of 
our petroleum; it uses all of the im- 
ported oil. The efficiency of the US 
transport system is 8%, based on a 
figure of 0.16 kW-hr (6 x 10’^ 
ergs) per ton-mile. Electrical vehi- 
cles can at least double that effi- 
ciency, even taking into account 
losses in transmission over wires, 
charging batteries, and all the rest. 
If we also include the costs of pol- 
lution control, the advantage of 
electric vehicles looms even greater. 

At the moment there’s no incen- 
tive to develop electric cars and 
trucks and the like: there’s not 
enough electricity. If tomorrow 
morning all our cars were magically 
converted into electric vehicles, 
we’d be paralyzed. 

We have non-polluting means of 
generating electricity: nuclear power 
plants. No. Modern fission plants 
are not the long-term solution to the 
world’s energy problem, nor are 
they entirely safe (although com- 
pared to the health costs of coal 
they come off rather well). They 
produce plutonium which has a 
number of problems associated with 
it. But they’d get us past any cur- 
rent energy crisis, and if we had 
enough electricity we would 
develop — finish, really, because 
we’ve just about invented it — the 
technology to convert from internal 
combustion to electric transport; that 



in itself would save more energy 
than we could get from burning all 
our garbage and sewage — and it 
would move us a long way toward 
energy independence. 

Meanwhile, for the long-term I’d 
finance a lot of research into more 
efficient energy-fixing crops; I’d put 
development money into ocean- 
thermal energy (described in several 
earlier columns, and useful because 
a good bit of the research goes into 
low-heat turbine systems which can 
be used as bottoming cycles on ex- 
isting powerplants even if they 
never got to sea); I’d change the tax 
laws to give lower property taxes to 
those who insulate their houses and 
install solar heaters (rather than the 
ruinous fines called “increased 
property valuation’’ that the city 
now levies on you for insulating); 
and I’d put a bit more into fusion. 
Finally, I’d change the tax laws to 
let all kinds of private enterprises 
do research in the field of energy 
conservation and efficiencies, even 
if that meant lower tax revenue and 
thus laying off some bureaucrats. 

But perhaps that’s a dream world, 
no more realistic than the dream of 
those who’d run the US of A on its 
own garbage. 

I’ve pointed out in previous arti- 
cles that there are many ways to 
produce enough energy to operate 
our industrial economy. A combina- 
tion of sewage processing and ag- 
riculture for ethanol can be yet 
another. I don’t know which of 
these ways is preferable, but many 
are feasible. We can get enough 
energy; we don’t have to collapse 
and die; all we really have to do is 
stop wringing our hands and get on 
with the job. ★

Xhe evening meal was better 
than usual; the peas were not quite 
so much like buckshot, the meat a 
bit more tender with less of the 
stringy bits like insulation wire, the 
potatoes less full of sprouts and 
black spots, even the wme tasted 
less like vinegar. 

The voice of Brother James 
droned on from the end of the table. 

“If the nearness of our last 
necessity, brought a nearer confor- 
mity into it, there were a happiness 
in hoary hairs, and no calamity in 

half senses.” . 

A difficult reading tonight. 
Brother John thought. What was it 
again? Urn Burial? Yes, that was it. 
Five hundred years old. No wonder 

the difficulty. ’ 

Brother John looked to his left 
down the length of the long table, 
now largely empty. Here and there 
a brother such as himself took the 
nightly repast and listened to the 
words of Brother James. 

“But the most tedious being is 
that which can unwish itself, con- 
tent to be nothing — ” 

We are ever fewer. Brother John 
thought again as he did now more 
and more often. He felt a sense of 
sadness, but not depression. What 
they were doing was good and 
needed doing. He looked past the 
mathematics table,' the sciences to- 
ble, the agricultural table, to the 
wail where the old motto hung: 
“Preserve Knowledge Through the 

Long Dark Electronic Night.” 

Yes, that was right. That was the 

duty. ^ , 

Brother James read on. Others 
from the other disciplines were 
reading also at the long tables in the 
great hall of the Fulda. 

136 



“What time the persons of these 
Ossuaries entered the famous Na- 
tions of the dead, and slept with 
Princes and Counsellors, might 
admit a wide solution.” 

What were ossuaries again.' 
thought Brother John. Ah, yes, 
places for bones, I remember now. 

It comes from the Latin os, for 
bone. That’s right. But how are we 
to understand, “might admit a wide 
solution”? What might? 

Brother John sighed as he 
finished the last of his custard. It 
had been made from real milk and 
was sour as usual. If only the 
brothers had more time for husband- 
ry the food might be better. But 
they were so few, and there was so 
much to be done. 

How difficult it was to keep 
knowledge alive. How difficult to 
be an Einhard, to keep, to hold, to 
preserve knowledge against that 
time when man would once again 
stand in need of it. But this reading 
was difficult, no doubt about it. He 
would have to study it in detail to- 
morrow. Still it was easier than last 
month’s reading, the Mart d’ Arthur. 

Senior Brother Roger coughed 
softly and looked down the table at 
them. Brother James stopped read- 
ing and squeezed the book shut with 
a hissing, reverential, shhh. 

Brother Roger cleared his throat. 
At each of the other tables senior 
brothers were doing likewise. 

“Brothers,” he said. The word 
reverberated from all the tables like 
an echo. Chairs scraped as the 
brothers stood and filed out to the 
commons for brandy and smokes. 

“Brother John,” the voice of the 
Senior Brother stopped him just as 
he reached the door. 



GALAXY 



“Yes, Senior Brother?” 

Brother Roger looked uncomfort- 
able. “I realize this is an imposi- 
tion ...” 

Brother John said nothing, merely 
waited. 

“Well, you know — . Well, the 
truth is. Brother John, we have re- 
cruiting appointments in Capital to- 
morrow. We had enough credits 
from handcraft sales to buy one 
Tri-V ad, and — ” 

“Oh?” 

‘‘Yes, — and I rather thought. 
Well, Brother, not to put too fine a 
point on it, I think you are the one 
to represent the English Einhards.” 

Brother John sighed. He had 
done this before. It was unpleasant 
but someone had to go. How else 
would long tables ever be filled? 

“Of course I’ll go,” he said. 

“That’s fine,” the Senior Brother 
said. “I knew you would. The 
bus will be in front of Fulda at 
eight.” 

Brother John nodded. Before he 
could leave. Brother Roger’s voice 
again stopped him. 

“Brother John — ” 

‘‘Yes?” 

“Please wear your best tweed 
and leathers.” 

He nodded again and went off, 
bypassing the commons, walking 
straight to his cell. 

Wear my best tweed and leathers, 
he thought. What best? Well, he 
would see if pressing up his other 
set a bit might make them more 
presentable. And a damp cloth for 
the easier spots. 

He sighed again. Ah, to keep 
knowledge alive. 

★ ★ ★ 



The interviews were given in a 
small set of rooms allotted them by 
the municipality. Brother John was 
shown his room by a rather insolent 
young employee who looked at 
Brother John with a condescending 
smirk, as if he were dealing with a 
moron or a primitive. 

“Hee yah, pers,” the young man 
muttered as he unlocked the door. 

“Wan sum else, talk a me, 
pers,” he muttered again and closed 
the door. 

He would be some time before 
the first interview, so he looked 
curiously around this room that was 
so different from anything in Fulda. 

In a sense it was The Enemy. It 
was the electronic night through 
which they were trying to preserve 
knowledge for that day — who knew 
when? — centuries, millennia, down 
the road when man would again re- 
alize his need for it — and for those 
who understood it. 

He sat at the information console, 
studied the buttons and color coded 
tabs. He gave up trying to make 
sense of it and pushed buttons at 
random. The wall lit up and a 
man’s face began giving directions 
on filling out “your decess income 
form.” Brother John wondered at 
the word. .of course; the opposite 
of excess. He shuddered. He pushed 
another combination of buttons and 
music sprang from the walls ac- 
companied by flickering patterns of 
color. Another series of punches 
gave him only an engimatic voice 
saying, “The answer is three 
hundred ninety-nine.” He had ob- 
viously asked the machine an arith- 
metic question but he had no idea 
what it was. 

Finally he gave up and lay on the 



BROTHER JOHN'S DAY OUT 



137 



bed to think. It began to pulse and 
vibrate to the sound of soft music. 
He pushed distastefully at the but- 
tons on the headboard but the bed 
merely went faster and the music 
became more frantic, louder and 
more loathsome. 

Brother John surrendered again 
and tried to relax. The long bus ride 
into Capital from Fulda had tired 
him. And no wonder, riding in a 
hand-made bus over roads that were 
no longer used, maintained or 
needed. If recruiting were not so 
important no one would ever ven- 
ture out. And then to have a flat tire 
on top of it. It had been humiliat- 
ing, he had to admit, to stand amid 
the weeds and broken pavement of 
the old road, getting tweed and 
leathers filthy, while aircars and 
hoppers zoomed low or hovered, 
each full of malicious, laughing 
eyes. He squinched his eyes to- 
gether to make it all go away and 
be good again. 

Brother John realized he was hav- 
ing one of his periods of doubt: 
maybe he wasn’t meant to be an 
Einhard. Perhaps they were all fool- 
ing themselves. He thought of the 
bus leaving the Fulda compound, 
past the animal compound, past the 
weaving shed where the tweeds 
were made, past the dairy, past the 
winery, past the fields with growing 
things . such as they were. Was 
it worth it, this obsession to keep 
the old skills alive when they 
weren’t wanted qr needed and might 
never be? 

But of course it was. The first 
Einhard had seen that clearly. The 
catastrophe would come, in what- 
ever form: war, environmental col- 
lapse, another ice age, madness — 

138 



who knew? but it would come. 
Civilizations always fall. And when 
this one did the Fuldas of the world 
would start things up again. 

The room-announcer told him he 
had a visitor. Wearily, he climbed 
from the quivering bed. His feet felt 
for the floor as if he were stepping 
onto a dock from a bobbing raft. He 
gazed distastefully at the room 
again: no, this was not for him. He 
pressed the button to let in the first 
candidate. 

Two hours later he was finished. 
Three young men, only three. Still, 
it could have been worse; he might 
have had no applicants at all. He 
wondered how the other brothers 
had done. 

He looked down at his notes, re- 
viewing the three candidates. 

* * * 

The first had come in confi- 
dently, giving Brother John the 
ritual punch in the chest that was 
the vogue now. Brother John at first 
recoiled, then tried to hide his dis- 
taste. After all, it wasn’t the lad’s 
fault ... but all the same — 

“Please be seated.” 

“Howz?” the boy asked in obvi- 
ous bewilderment. 

Brother John gathered himself to- 
gether. 

“Siddan.” 

The lad smiled broadly and 
slumped into a chair. He punched a 
button oh the arm and the room was 
full of music and dancing lights. 
Brother John winced. 

“Please turn it off so we can 
talk,” he said. 

The boy stared back at him. 
“Clear’t,” Brother John said, 

GALAXY 



louder than he had intended. 

Morosely the boy made the room 
quiet and dim again. He squirmed 
in his seat. 

“Yur num Joey Bing?” Brother 
John asked. 

“Ya copy.” 

“Tell me about yourself, your 
background.” 

“I dun copy.” 

Brother John sighed. It would be 
a long half hour. 

“Wan yur life printout,’’ he 
said. 

“Ah,” the boy said, “I MR it 
furya.” 

He tapped away at the minicomp 
on his wrist. 

“Error,” Brother John said, 
again much too loudly. The boy 
looked up in surprise. 

Brother John tried to go on in an 
even and gentle voice. 

“Doan comp it. Can’t you MR it 
yaself?” 

The boy was amazed. 

“Wha? Got muh egoplak inna 
comp. Gotit all. Wha shudda?” 

So it went. At the end Brother 
John asked the standard question. 

“Why ya wanna be Einhard?” 

The boy’s forehead crinkled with 
the effort of thought. Finally he 
smiled. He had the answer. 

“Fushuh I compa no funna 
home. Old man error. Old lady bad 
head circ, no — CE that. She over- 
load more. Anywuh, no funnahome. 
Wann punch your circ.” 

Brother John sighed again. A 
loser from a losing family. 

“Thank you. We’ll call if we 
want you,” he. said, not caring if 
the boy understood. 

The second candidate had sort of 
slid into the room. He seemed to do 



everything sideways, edging 
through life like a crab. He was a 
thin boy with a scraggly beard and 
hair to match. Pimples stuck up 
through his beard like hillocks 
through the underbrush. He smiled 
in a way Brother John could only 
think of as a leer. 

Unpleasant as he looked, the lad 
was more articulate than the first. 
But the thought of sitting next to 
this boy at long table made him 
shudder. 

“And why do you want to be an 
Einhard?” Brother John asked the 
final question. 

“Well ah, yuh know,” the lad 
said. “Yuh know.” 

“I’m afraid I don’t,” Brother 
John said. 

Again the smile that was a leer, 
as if the boy were winking with his 
lips. 

“Yuh know,” he said again, 
“cause a what you do out there.” 

“And what do we do?” 

“Yuh know, with the doll 
Einhards. Make ’em happy, yuh 
know. I can do that. I got recom- 
mends.” 

Brother John could not even be 
angry. It was all too silly, in a dis- 
gusting kind of way. 

“There are no women Einhards,” 
he said. “There are no women at 
all in Fulda.” 

The smile came back uncertainly, 
like writhing snakes. 

“I copy,” the boy said. “What- 
evah ya say.” 

After he had gone Brother John 
sat several minutes bracing for the 
final interview. He’d had no need. 
It went well, even pleasantly. 

The last lad came in, staring with 
myopic hesitation around the room. 



BROTHER JOHN'S DAY OUT 



139 



as if his contacts hadn’t been prop- 
erly fitted. He was overweight and 
pale, and his hair grew in clumps 
like wisps of limp straw that hung 
over his round little face. He had a 
doughy look about him, as if his 
flesh would retain an identation if 
you pressed it with your finger. 

Not very prepossessing. Brother 
John thought, but then neither am I. 
Nor was I at his age either, he 
added in the interest of strict truth. 

But wonder of wonders, the boy 
could actually speak. He could 
make sense of the spoken word. He 
could construct real sentences — not 
perfectly, but well enough to give 
hope. 

Brother John crossed his fingers 
and asked the next question. 

“Can you read?’’ 

The boy smiled his lumpy little 
smile: “Yes.” 

“I mean real words, on paper. 
Real English words. Not comp talk; 
real words.” 

“Yes.” 

Brother John took a paper from 
his case and gingerly handed it to 
the boy. 

“Read this.” 

The paper contained a series of 
sentences of graduated difficulty, 
from the very simple, “The boy 
threw the ball,” to the very dif- 
ficult, “Four score and seven years 
ago, our fathers — .” 

The boy made it halfway through 
before breaking down. 

Not bad. Brother John thought, 
not bad at all. There was hope. 

“And,” Brother John asked the 
ultimate question, “why do you 
want to be an Einhard? Why do you 
want to wear the tweed and leath- 
ers?” 



“I don’t know if I can say,” the 
lad replied. “It’s more a feel, I 
guess.” 

He thought a minute while 
Brother John waited. 

“All right,” he said at last, “I 
Comp,” and then blushed. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. “I mean I 
think I understand.” 

“That’s all right. Take your 
time.” 

“I read a poem once — ” 

“You read poetry?” Brother John 
said with astounded delight. The 
boy nodded. 

“Yes. A little. I didn’t under- 
stand more than half of this one. 
But I remember the first line and I 
guess it says how I feel.” 

“And it was — ?” 

“Life too much with us,” the 
boy said, “that’s it. Life too much 
with us.” 

Brother John thought quickly. He 
did not want to be embarrassed by 
not remembering it. Ah, yes, he 
had it now. 

“Yes,” he said, “that poem is 
from the nineteenth century. But it 
goes, ‘Life is too much with us.’ 
You forgot the ‘is’.” 

“Is?” the boy said. 

“Yes, you see you need a form 
of the verb ‘to be’ to make the sen- 
tence.” 

The boy stared at him, downcast. 
“Don’t worry about it,” Brother 
John said, “you’ve done quite 
well.” 

He arranged for the boy to visit 
Fulda before deciding to take vows. 
He shook the doughy little hand one 
more time. The lad left and sud- 
denly he was alone again. 

Three candidates, one a possible 
novitiate; not bad at all for these

GALAXY 



degenerate days. Again he won- 
dered how the math and science 
brothers had done. Suddenly 
Brother John smiled wickedly and 
put his notes away; time now to be 
naughty. He whistled as he tied the 
case shut. 

The young clerk who had shown 
him to his room happened to be 
exiting as Brother John entered 
the lift. “See ya, Pers. Doan do a 
bad,” the man said condescendingly 
as the door irised shut between 
them. 

★ ★ ★ 

There was a self-serv on the 
ground floor. Brother John looked 
at the pictures of the various unreal 
foods. Below each was a slot where 
you put your credplak, and a little 
door below that where the food 
came out. He was tempted to go 
all the way, but then he recollected 
his oath of moderation — and his 
low cred balance. He selected a 
piece of pie. He put his credplak in 
the slot. Nothing happened. He 
tried again. Still nothing. 

“You’ve got an expired plak,” 
the man behind him said. 

“Oh? I didn’t know.” Brother 
John said, dismayed. 

“Yes, new ones were issued last 
month. Didn’t you hear?” 

“No, I’m afraid not. We don’t 
get much news.” Brother John put 
his worthless credplak away and 
turned to leave. His stomach, not 
knowing the details, rumbled a pro- 
test. 

“I’ll get it for you,” the stranger 
said. 

Brother John looked at him, con- 
sidering. One couldn’t be too care-

ful in the city. The stories! Still, the 
man looked decent enough. 

“I really couldn’t,” Brother John 
said, for form’s sake. 

“It’s all right. It’s only a piece of 
pie.” 

“Well, I thank you then.” 

The man put his credplak in the 
slot and the door opened. Brother 
John took the pie. 

“Something to drink?” the man 
said. 

“Well, if it wouldn’t be an im- 
position, perhaps some coffee.” 

The man chuckled noiselessly. 

“Wouldn’t be an imposition,” he 
repeated. “I love that. If you knew 
how that sounded.” 

“I’m soiry — ” 

The stranger brushed this off. 

“No, no, I love it. I really do,” 
he said. 

They sat at a small table in the 

141 



corner. Brother John put the first 
bite of pie in his mouth and almost 
cried it was so good. Then he 
sipped the cofee, held it in his 
mouth until all the little taste buds 
had gotten their little hooks into it. 

"Ah,” he said. 

It was strange. He knew that not 
a single thing in either the pie or 
the coffee was natural, not one 
thing. It was all synthetic, made to 
duplicate the taste and consistency* 
of the real thing. No, he thought, it 
was better than the real thing, at 
least as served at Fulda. 

“You’re an Einhard, aren’t 
you?” the man asked. 

“Yes,” Brother John mumbled, 
his mouth full. 

“Thought so,” the man said. 

“We aren’t hard to recognize.” 

“No, you’re not. Indeed you’re 
not.” 

The stranger looked at Brother 
John steadily. 

“No, indeed you’re not,” he 
went on. “Not many people are 
loose wearing hand-made coats with 
plastic elbow patches.” 

“They aren’t plastic,” Brother 
John said, somewhat irritated. 
“They’re leather.” 

“You mean—?” 

Brother John nodded. 

“Yes, real animal skin. We raise 
animals.” 

“I’d heard that,” the man con- 
ceded. 

“And,” Brother John went on, 
“the coat is not handmade. It is 
tweed made on our own power 
looms.” 

“Yes, I’d heard that too.” 

Brother John finished the pie and 
began nursing the coffee. 

“The truth is,” the stranger said, 

142 



“I once toyed with the idea of be- 
coming an Einhard.” 

“Oh?” Brother John said, in- 
terested. “Why didn’t you?” 

The man shrugged and thought 
for the right words. 

“I don’t know. I think I realized 
that it would be an escape, an 
evasion — running away.” 

“You think I am running away?” 
Brother John asked simply. 

“Well, yes,” he hesitated. “All 
right, yes I do. What else do you 
call it, dressing in old-fashioned 
clothes, calling yourselves by an- 
tiquated names and titles — even 
‘Einhard’ and ‘Fulda’ have no rela- 
tion to reality. Just because a man 
named Einhard, living in a place 
called Fulda, started the whole thing 
a hundred and fifty years ago — ’ ’ 
“That’s not quite correct,” 
Brother John said. 

“That’s what I’ve heard,” the 
man said obstinately. 

“Oh, it’s true enough,” Brother 
John went on, trying to be kind, 
“that our order was started by first 
Senior Brother Einhard in the first 
sanctuary called Fulda — ” 

“That’s what I said,” the man 
said. 

“ — but the names come from 
something much older. Einhard was 
really a scholar living in the monas- 
tery of Fulda in the ninth century.” 
“The ninth century?” 

Brother John nodded. 

“Yes, that first Einhard preserved 
the only copy of an old Latin work 
on the lives of the Roman 
emperors — ” Brother John was los- 
ing the man’s attention, he knew, 
“so it’s symbolic, you see,” he 
hurried on. “He preserved knowl- 
edge and so that’s why our first 

GALAXY 



Einhard took the name and called 
his sanctuary Fulda.” 

“And you think you are preserv- 
ing knowledge?” 

“Yes.” 

“Knowledge of what — and for 
what?” 

The question was so brutally 
simple that Brother John winced in 
spite of himself. 

“The basic knowledge of lan- 
guage, science, mathematics and all 
the other skills that man will need 
to start over.” 

The man nodded. 

“So I’ve heard,” he said. “But 
< you must see how useless that is.” 

^ “We don’t see it so,” Brother 
;■ John said stiffly. 

• The man shrugged again. 

“Well, it’s true. Look,” he went 
^ on seriously, “man is not going to 
I destroy his culture. He is not going 
E to blow himself up. He is not going 
r to starve. He couldn’t even if he 
I wanted to. Why, we can even han- 
I die a new ice age. Did you know 
f there are actually plans to do that?” 
t “No, I didn’t,” Brother John 
i said. 

{ “What you are doing might have 
I been valid a couple of hundred 
I years ago, but it isn’t now. We 
f don’t need it. We don’t need you. 
f All basic knowledge, all of it, is in 
f the machines. The machines could 
i recreate our culture by 
themselves — and they are virtually 
indestructable. Man doesn’t need to 
work — he doesn’t even need to 
I think.” 

I “But you obviously do think,” 

( Brother John parried. 

The stranger was embarrassed. 

I “That’s why I learned to talk old- 
I style: It’s my hobby.” 

I BROTHER JOHN'S DAY OUT 



“Ah,” Brother John said, “and 
that is perhaps why we build the 
Fuldas.” 

“As hobbies?” 

Now Brother John shrugged. 
“Perhaps not strictly that — and 
we are by no means convinced the 
machines might not fail — but to re- 
mind us that we are more than just 
creatures.” 

“What then?” 

“Creators. Even if what we 
create is unnecessary.” 

The man sat back in the chair and 
stared at Brother John. 

“You’re escaping,” he said 
loudly. “Why should you escape? 
Who gave you the right? Who gave 
you the right to avoid all this, 
this — ” he groped for a word, 
“dreck, this life?” 

Brother John recoiled from the 
, force of the man. He thought of the 
doughy, lumpy boy and ‘Life is too 
much with us,’ and could only 
shrug again. 

* ★ * 

It was his turn to fast and do the 
reading at dinner that night. The 
fast was easier this night because 
the remnants of pie and coffee 
seemed to still be with him, as was 
the bitterness of that final conversa- 
tion. The brothers were starting 
their potato soup when Brother John 
began to read. 

“I read tonight,” he said, “from 
the Manual of Style, as preserved 
by the Fulda at Newburgh, page 
ninety-two, third paragraph. ‘A 
semicolon is used to mark a more 
important break in sentence 
flow . .’ ” 

The brothers continued with their 
meal. They washed it all down with 
wine that tasted slightly of vinegar. ★

A hint of mortality adds 
spice to the existence 
of an Immortal — unless. 



rXARRis WAS UP and dressed by 
7:30, for the drive would take eight 
hours each way. Once, leaving late, 
he had stayed over in a guest room 
at the Institute, but had lain awake, 
his mind racing, the entire night. 
So, by getting an early start, he 
would be back by one the next 
morning. 

He walked into the bedroom to 
say good-bye to Martha. She was 
lying bn her side, waiting, watching 
for him. 

“You were quick this morning,” 
she said. Her hip rustled under the 
sheet, inviting him back to bed. He 
had designed the room years before 
with no sharp comers so that — he 
had laughingly told her at the 
time — the curves of the bed 
chamber would complement her 
own. He sat down beside her, and 
ran his hand gently over her hip. 
An erotic pull tugged at him, but 
other, more immediate things oc- 
cupied his mind. Her voice had 
been quizzical, and now her eyes 
asked the question they always 
asked — why was he going? Twice 
before, he had promised that he was 
going for the last time, and had be- 
lieved it; yet when the time rolled 
around, he had gone again. Partly, 



it was an obligation; there were so 
few obligations now, and any one 
was to be cherished; but something 
else drew him as well, a pull that 
lay hidden and unseen, like a pow- 
erful tide beneath a placid surface. 
Martha no longer vocalized the 
question. 

She rolled over on her back, with 
a little smile on her lips. She was 
attractive of course, and he was at- 
tracted, but he was also going. He 
kissed her briefly. They had shared 
many good years together, he 
thought, but perhaps it was time 
after all that they began to consider 
their separate ways. 

“Have a good trip,” she said 
with a little pout on her face, but 
then added, “I hope it’s all right.” 
This time her voice was gentle.

Harris slowed as he entered the 
gates and started up the curving 
lane. Past the pond, glimmering in 
the mid-aftemoon sun, the grounds 
rolled in a broad expanse of lawn 
up to the old mansion house. So 
perfect a scene. Yet Harris felt 
cold. He had even shuddered, as he 
always did, the moment he passed 
through the massive stone pillars, 
with the discreet sign, “Institute for 
the Study of the Abnormal.” The 
sight of the word ‘Abnormal’ 
brought home to him something he 
forgot for most of the time. For the 
abnormal in this immortal world 
was, simply, mortality. 



A PERFECT TWILIGHT 



145 



Many others forgot it altogether; 
it had been well over a century 
since death had touched their lives. 
But Harris, sometimes irritated, al- 
ways obligated, drawn, came once a 
month to visit his one living rela- 
tive, who was dying. 

He parked the car in a gravel lot 
that was hidden by the bushes and 
quickly got out. He stopped at the 
edge of the lawn; the only sounds 
were a wind in the woods on the far 
side of the house, and his own 
breathing. So perfect, so peaceful. 
He was an intruder. His eyes moved 
over the entire scene, as if to make 
sure it was safe to pass. Suddenly, 
he caught sight of a figure in a far 
corner, on the other side of the 
pond; the figure was not very clear, 
but it seemed to be a gardener, 
wearing a blue cap, working with 
an old-fashioned scythe to level tall 
grass that grew near the pond. 
Never before had he seen another 
person here. The figure disappeared 
into the trees. Harris shivered again. 
He concentrated on walking, and 
made his way briskly across the 
lawn, up the white stone steps, into 
the lobby. Only inside the door did 
the visitor discover that the facade 
of the house was like a stagesetting, 
preserved from the early part of the 
twentieth century. Behind it 
stretched the Institute with its 
gleaming interior alloy walls, as re- 
flective as mirrors, but in darker, 
more muted, more mysterious tones. 
As an architect, Harris was always 
annoyed by the design; he would 

146 



have preferred to have part of the 
mansion’s interior, which must 
have been magnificent in its own 
old-fashioned way, as a transition 
between the two centuries. 

“Dr. Reiner,’’ he said to the 
blonde-haired receptionist. She was 
new, but the receptionists often 
were, for people rotated in and out 
of such second-tier jobs every three 
months. While she phoned, he 
looked at her carefully. She was 
pretty, soft, almost pink, with a 
wide smile. He reminded himself to 
talk to her on the way out. 

“He’ll be here in five minutes. I 
hope you don’t mind waiting.” 

“Not at all.” He did not feel like 
chatting now, but afterwards, his 
obligation fulfilled, he would be 
back. 

He sat down in one of the white 
plastic chairs, which instantly 
adapted itself to his contours, and 
stared at himself in the wall oppo- 
site. How long had he looked this 
way? — 107, no, it was 108, or was 
it 1 10 years, or did it really matter? 
Of course, there were changes; two 
decades ago, he tired of the close- 
cropped hair style he had worn for 
so long, and had allowed his hair to 
grow out again. But that was 
cosmetic; there was no real change, 
only stasis, and he knew his image 
so well that he bored of looking. He 
let his hand drop onto the console 
next to him; the section of wall op- 
posite him flashed into a screen. He 
flicked through fourteen channels 
until he came to a revival of a mus- 



GAIAXY 



ical he remembered from the 1990s, 
just before the Great Death. One of 
the songs came back into his head, 
“I’ll Be Waiting,” and he hummed 
it with the actor. He wondered with 
whom he had first seen the musical, 
but it was so long ago, so difficult 
to remember people he had known, 
those who had not survived. It was 
easier to remember the song. He 
turned off the console, shut his 
eyes, and hummed the song again. 

“Aha, I wondered if you were 
still coming to us,” said Dr. 
Reiner. 

Harris stood as the angular doctor 
approached and they shook hands. 
The doctor’s hand was boney. They 
started down the corridors. “That’s 
dways your opening line.” 

“And I always wonder if you’re 
going to come to us.” 

“I do — every time.” 

“That’s true, but most people 
don’t, they don’t have any interest, 
they don’t want to know, and so I 
start to assume that eventually no- 
body will come and how quiet it 
will be here, and then you and one 
or two others surprise me.” 

Harris noticed some strain in the 
doctor’s manner. “How is he?” 
“Weaker. Degeneration seems to 
be accelerating, and his systems are 
failing. Frankly, I don’t think he 
can last much longer.” 

“How long?” 

They had reached the room. The 
doctor paused, his hand on the han- 
dle of the unopened door, his eyes 
gray, neutral. “I can only give you 



l^erforma 
death-de^ng act. 




Stop smoking.

an intuition. Three weeks — at 
most.” 

The words passed Harris by. He 
had heard them, but he could not 
extract the meaning. The doctor 
pushed open the door and gestured 
Harris in. “You’ll have to excuse 
me. I have business. ...” That too 
was a stock remark of the doctor, 
but now it was said with less po- 
liteness and more conviction. 

“Of'course,” murmured Harris, 
but by then the door was already 
closed behind him. 

Harris sat in the corner, under- 
neath the wall console. Slowly, his 
eyes fixed on the old man, who 
slept, half-sitting in what might 
have been a bower of vines and 



A PERFECT TWILIGHT 



147 



branches, but these vines and 
branches were the wires and tubes 
that linked him to dials and reg- 
ulators and fluids. The room smel- 
led of antiseptic, stingingly so. This 
person was the closest genetically to 
him in the entire world; the dif- 
ference between them was one of 
life and death, but it was such a 
small difference, an enzyme bal- 
ance, that explained why Harris’ 
face was only slightly lined, no 
more than it had been a century be- 
fore, while that of the old man was 
as ravaged as a gully in a drought. 

At last, after what seemed an 
hour to Harris but was in fact only 
ten minutes, the old man opened his 
eyes, and struggled for a moment to 
focus on Harris. 

“Hello,” said Harris. 

“Hello,” said the old man. His 
voice was parched, a croak, every 
word an effort. He managed to 
smile slightly in greeting. “You 
here long?” 

“No, no, I just arrived.” 

They chatted now, with Harris 
doing most of the talking. He told 
the old man about the two hou'ses 
he was designing for the parklands 
north of the urban hub, and then 
hurried on, in great detail, to his 
trip last weekend to the highlands in 
East Africa, and on to his plans for 
skiing next week in New Zealand. 

“Do you still travel with that 
nice woman you told me about — ” 

“Martha. Yes.” 

“Good.” 

Harris’ mind wandered for a 

148 



moment to the growing distance he 
felt between Martha and himself, 
but he was not even so sure of that 
distance, and there would be so 
much time to decide. There was al- 
ways so much time. 

The old man tried to shift himself 
a little higher in the bed, but the ar- 
tificial bower kept him from moving 
very far. Harris found it painful' to 
watch so much effort for so little. 
There was a silence. 

“You know,” said the old man 
finally, “your world is a very lei- 
sured place.” Harris did not reply, 
and the old man continued, strug- 
gling to get out his sentences. “I’ve 
had leisure too, leisure to lie here 
and think about myself. Sometimes 
I’ve thought it was very unfair. I’m 
here. Why? Why couldn’t I devote 
my life to enjoying life like the rest 
of you? Why am I here with the 
others whose bodies wouldn’t stop 
growing old?. But I don’t think 
it’s unfair anymore. .1 don’t 
think it’s important that I’m a 
freak.” 

Harris remembered the shock 
when, after thirty years of stasis, 
they had learned that the Treatment 
had failed with the old man, that his 
body had ceased regenerating, and 
again had begun to degenerate. 
What reassurance could he give 
now? What lies? “Don’t give up 
hope now. There’s still the possibil- 
ity that it can be stopped. That’s 
what they’re working on here. 
That’s why you’re here.” 

The old man said nothing im- 

GALAXY 



mediately, but instead seemed to be 
storing up another burst of energy. 
He shifted again. “Don’t be kind to 
me,” he said without any sharp- 
ness. “I know what’s happening. I 
can feel it inside myself, I some- 
times think I can hear it ticking. 
And — even if they could reverse 
it — I’m not sure anymore that I’d 
want to live forever.” 

Harris felt a clenching in his 
chest, like a panic. Now he com- 
prehended fully what the doctor had 
said, the finality. And then the old 
man, as though deliberately reiterat- 
ing what he knew what was on Har- 
ris’ mind, said, “I’m different from 
you. I’m going to die. Soon.’’ 
Evenly, he added, “And I’m not 
afraid. Not any longer.” It sounded 
like a prayer. 

A few minutes later Harris stood 
to leave. They had never talked like 
this before, and it was difficult to 
pick up the chatter. The old man 
seemed to have slipped away a bit; 
the exertion of talking had drained 
him. His eyes, however, were fas- 
tened on Harris, and the way he 
looked was eerie, as though from a 
great distance. The farewell was 
awkward and abrupt, but fortunately 
brief. Harris said he would see the 
old man again in a few weeks. 
Another lie. 

Harris’ legs were weak beneath 
him as he walked down the soft-lit 
corridor, and he sat down on a 
couch. A terror settled down with 
him, but the terror gave away to 
sadness. He cried, sobbing quietly. 



Then he caught sight of himself in 
the alloy wall. It was an image of 
himself that he could never re- 
member having seen before. It was 
so unusual, so amusing, so much a 
novelty, that he stopped crying to 
watch, but of course the image had 
fled, and he was back to his normal 
self. 

* * * 

“He knows he’s going to die,” 
Harris said to Dr. Reiner. The two 
men were strolling, as had become 
customary after the visit, in the gar- 
den behind the mansion house. “He 
says he feels it within himself.” 

“I’m not surprised. A substantial 
part of him is already dead; it’s 
only the machines that keep him 
alive.” 

Harris did not reply. 

The doctor eyed him curiously. 
“You have no reaction?’’ There 
was a mocking edge to his voice. 

“I don’t know what to say,” 
Harris shot back defensively. 
“What can I do?” 

“It was not my intention to make 
you angry. I meant the question in a 
serious manner. My reactions are 
shaped, and limited, by my work, 
and I wonder about someone like 
you from the outside. .” 

Harris thought of the fleeting 
image of himself that he had caught 
in the mirror-wall. A strange sight. 
One rarely felt any peaks of emo- 
tion, especially of that kind. “I 
suppose I — we — aren’t very good at

facing death? We’re out of prac- 
tice. ’ ’ 

“I’m not sure that man was ever 
any good, even before the Plague.’’ 
“But you, it doesn’t seem to 
bother you.” 

Passing through a small wood, 
they had come out on a bluff, and 
now they sat down on a bench, fac- 
ing out over the river. A flock of 
birds rose and then resettled in the 
forest across the river. “It’s my 
work,” Reiner said at last. He fin- 
gered the lapel of his white coat. 
“You see. I’m a doctor.” 

“And you chose it?” What made 
the dutiful part of his visits less dut- 
iful for Harris was talking with Re- 
iner, prickly, puzzling, intelligent, 
sardonic — deliberately choosing to 
live on the edge of two worlds. But 
Harris had always before felt it 
would be an intrusion to ask him 
why he sought this memento mori 
in a world in which it was unneces- 
sary, and even now, Harris’ ques- 
tion was ill-formed. 

“I’m fascinated.” The doctor 
smiled thinly. He had admitted his 
perverse fetishism, and then, when 
he became aware of Harris’ lack of 
explicit reaction, he chuckled diyly 
and asked, “And why do you think 
you come here?” 

“He’s my relative, my only liv- 
ing relative, and he’s dying.” 

“Oh, come now, that could only 
be part. You’re here because you 
too — are fascinated.” 

“You make it sound — ” 

“Again, you misunderstand me. 



I’m not saying there’s anything sick 
about it on your part, just that 
you’re drawn. You are, you know.” 

Irritated at the doctor’s arrogance, 
his diagnosis, Harry was in no 
hurry to respond. At last, he nod- 
ded; the doctor, he reluctantly had 
to admit, had touched a truth, the 
pull trying to tug him from one 
world back to another, the force 
that Martha could never see. 

“I think many of us take immor-- 
tality so much for granted,” the 
doctor went on, “that we forget 
what a miracle, what a gift, it is. 
And that it came to us out of death. 
So to see death is to see our rebirth. 
If the Great Plague had not killed so 
many, billions of people, then Von 
Hoffmann and the other Researchers 
would have no setting, no reason, 
to figure out why twenty percent 
did survive, and then they would 
never have discovered — ” 

The doctor abruptly stopped. Har- 
ris thought he was collecting his 
thoughts, but then he realized that 
the doctor was half-turned on the 
bench, listening. Harris heard it too. 
A rustling, a whipping of leaves 
and branches in the woods. Then a 
shriek, and another. 

They moved quickly down a path 
that ran off to the side. The shrieks 
grew louder. In the center of a 
small clearing, a man stood. He 
was whirling a scythe at shoulder 
level in a circle around him, clip- 
ping trees and branches, alternately 
making that shriek and moaning as 
he did so, as though in some pagan 



150 



GALAXY 



ritual. He wore a blue cap. This 
was the figure, Harris realized, that 
he had seen gardening when he had 
come into the Institute. The man’s 
narrow face was contorted. 

The doctor stepped into the clear- 
ing, just out of range of the instru- 
ment. “You must stop this at once, 
or you will injure yourself.” 

The man did stop, froze, with the 
scythe hlld out from him like a lance, 
his eyes widening as he looked at 
the doctor. “You. You’re here. 
You’re watching me, you’re always 
watching me, following me, why 
won’t you let me be!” The doctor, 
in his eyes, seemed to be an appari- 
tion, a tormentor. 

“You must put that down. At 
once!” commanded the doctor. 

The man neither set it down nor 
spoke. Instead he began to advance 
slowly on the doctor, his face 
drawn tight in its strange emotions. 
Reiner lost some of his authority, 
his self-confidence. “I told you to 
put it down!^’ He began to back 
away, in a semi-circular path. 

“No, no, no,” the man repeated, 
approaching. As in a dance, the 
doctor retreated further. 

“Put it down for God’s sake!” 

“No — no — no.” 

“Aaahhh!” The doctor tumbled 
back, over a root, onto the ground. 

Now the man loomed above the 
doctor, raising the scythe over his 
own head. Now it was Reiner’s turn 
to freeze, where he had fallen. 

Harris leaped. As he did, the man 
turned, dropping the scythe. There 



MOVING? 

Not very surprisingly, if you 
are a Galaxy subscriber 
chances are you tend to move 
around a lot; seeing new 
places, doing new things, living 
in new homes. This is just fine, 
of course, but from the rather 
specialized point of view of our 
Subscription Department it does 
present a problem. 

You see, while computers are 
fast and accurate, they are not, 
even ours, very bright. So when 
you inform them of a change of 
address, you should do it in a 
special way. Like this:

and you should include an ac- 
tual Galaxy subscription 
address-label from your old ad-

might not understand, and that 
might mean that your next issue

quickly as it should: a terrible

was surprise on his face, but at the 
moment their glance met, Harris 
saw something else in his eyeS. 

The other man was strong, but 
Harris had the advantage, having 
caught him from the side, and Har- 
ris forced him to the ground, onto 
his belly, and pinned him. Reiner 
scrambled to his feet, and then sim- 
ply stood there, watching, as though 
he were critically observing a scene 
acted out for his benefit. 

“Reiner, don’t let it lie there,” 
Harris called out, while the man 
struggled to get free. 

“Yes,” said Reiner, almost 
absent-mindedly, and he picked it 
up. He shook his head once, and 
then reached into his pocket for a 
radio, and whispered a few words 
into it. Harris no longer had any 
difficulty holding the man to the 
ground, for the man’s strength 
seemed to have gone out of him, 
and his muscles were flaccid. 
Within minutes, three other man — 
one of them Harris recognized as 
another research doctor — appeared, 
gave the man an injection, and car- 
ried him off. 

The doctor stood silently. He let 
the scythe drop to the ground, and 
then brushed himself off with 
meticulous care, as though to re- 
cover his dignity. “Thank you.” 
But his face was still very pale. 

“Who was that?” 

A new admission.” The phrase 
sounded odd to Harris, but then he 
thought of the man’s face, which he 
had seen only in the first moment of 

152 



the grapple, pinched and drawn. He 
also recalled the look in the eyes. 

“He in fact is very healthy,” 
continued Reiner, “and working in 
the garden and woods seemed a 
sound activity. His aging has only 
slightly advanced.” 

“Judging by the way he went 
after you, perhaps he ought not to 
continue his gardening.” 

“I’m quite convinced that I was 
only a convenient target for his 
anger.” 

“Anger at what?” 

“Oh, I would hazard a guess, 
and say himself. Come, let’s go 
back.” 

“Do you get many new admis- 
sions?” asked Harris. A natural 
question, yet one that had never oc- 
curred to him before. 

The doctor rubbed the side of his 
face. He did not answer im- 
mediately. “Before — we were talk- 
ing about the fascination. There’s 
another reason, a very practical rea- 
son, for my interest — my fascina- 
tion. I am coming to the conclu- 
sion^ one that I always feared, that 
the gift of immortality is, strictly 
speaking, limited.” 

Harris sucked in a breath. 

“You see,” went on Reiner, “in the 
last eighteen months we’ve had over 
sixty new admissions — in no way 
numerically significant, not even in 
terms of error, but yet it is interest- 
ing that, after a century of statis, 
the degeneration begins again for no 
apparent reason. Of course. I’m not 
positive, but I think it is probably 



GALAXY 



I 



I impossible to permanently retard the 
Hayflick Effect. You know. Von 
Hoffmann himself was never sure 
that the regeneration was perma- 
nent, but the irony was that he him- 
self had been touched by the Plague 
and died before he could finish his 
work. And it seemed — impolite for 
anyone else to question his wonder- 
ful gift. I like to think of myself as 
his heir. When he was dying, he 
said he regretted that he would not 
be able to see the new future.” The 
doctor’s voice was little more than a 
whisper. “But, I fear, the new fu- 
ture is not as different as we 
thought from the old.” 

Harris felt dizzy and confused 
from what the doctor was saying, 
but some calm returned when they 
came out from the woods at a 
comer of the broad lawn in front of 
the mansion. Reiner stopped and 
gripped Harris’ shoulder tightly, 
pinching it. The hand was bony 
and cold. “I would not have told 
you this, except for what happened. 
Please, you must keep this a secret. 
We can’t have it known — ^it would 
threaten everything, everybody, and 
we don’t know for sure. There is 
still hope. .” 

Hope. That was what Harris had 
offered the old man. He looked 
across the lawn to the beautiful 
•' mansion house, standing as a for- 
V tress against time in the perfect 
twilight. That was what life itself 
had become, a permanent perfect 
twilight. But now, he learned, night 
still waited. 



“Yes,” he replied to the doctor 
as though he had not heard what the 
doctor had said. 

Reiner was clearly unhappy with 
this evasive reply. 

* ★ ★ 

Harris pushed open the door. He 
had come back again, to say good- 
bye, but the old man was asleep. 
Harris scanned the room quickly, to 
fix everything in memory, includ- 
ing, finally, the figure in the bed, 
for this would be his last visit. He 
understood now what fascination 
had drawn him, but with his new 
knowledge, he no longer felt the 
pull. It was no longer necessary to 
come, to see, to remind himself. 
And the old man’s time was short. 

At the door Harris turned to find 
the old man’s eyes on him again. 
And Harris saw it again. The dis- 
tance in the eyes. Harris recognized 
what he had glimpsed in the eyes of 
the man in the woods. A knowl- 
edge. 

“Good-bye again,” said Harris 
softly. 

The head moved slightly in a 
nod, and then the eyes shut again. 

Reiner was waiting, scowling al- 
most menacingly, in the corridor. 
What point would there be, what 
would be accomplished? “Of 
course,” said Harris firmly. “I’ll 
keep your secret.” 

The doctor’s dignity did not per- 
mit him to say thank you a second 
time, and so he simply grinned 
pleasantly, his scowl gone. They 
shook hands. 



A PERFECT TWILIGHT 



153 



“I shall see you again.” 

“Perhaps,” Harris replied. 

The doctor was again bothered by 
the evasiveness in Harris’ reply. 

it -k it 

The blonde woman was still at 
reception, still alluring, but Harris 
walked quickly by. Deep shadows 
now stretched across the front lawn. 
He felt an urgency to be home. He 
thought of Martha that morning, 
warm in bed. Martha. 

* * * 

The beacon buzzed in the car. 
The highway was coming to an end, 
and Harris would have to switch 
from auto-glide to manual. The 
clock said 00:25, and the night was 
dark and smooth. He had been doz- 
ing, but restlessly, conjuring faces 
and eyes — the doctor, the man with 
the scythe, his own crying reflection 
in the corridor. And that of the old 
man. 

The old man had said that he 
could sense the death inside him. 
And now, as Harris rode through 
the night, he felt somewhere deep 
within himself an ache, a groan, 
and he wondered if that was how it 
began, with a small but terrifying 
reminder that mortality still lurked 
like a criminal in his bones. And 
that, in turn, made him think how 
odd it was that this person he called 
the old man should, in piercing 
fact, be his son. ★ 



GALAXY 




DIRECTIONS 



Dear Mr. Baen: 

As editor of the magazine Galaxy, I be- 
lieve you can be of help. Would you agree 
with the following statement? 

TRAVEL TO THE STARS IS NOT 
ONLY PRACTICAL, IT IS THE NORMAL 
COURSE OF EVENTS FOR INTELLIGENT 
BEINGS. It is generally agreed that travel to 
the stars is possible, but is it necessarily 
practical? (By practical I mean that manned 
voyages to the nearest 10, (XX) stars would 
take no longer than, say, a few months.) Ac- 
cording to the present view of physics (the 
Special Theory of Relativity), travel at 
speeds greater than 186,(X)0 mi/sec relative to 
the earth is impossible. Because of the great 
distances to these 10,000 stars, interstellar 
space travel would appear to be impracti- 
cal — unless, of eourse, we find a way to ex- 
ceed this speed. (If you think this impossible, 
then there is no need to read any farther, for 
it is assumed from hete-on-out that such 
speeds are not only possible, they will some- 
day become quite practical.) 

According to the present interpretation of 
relativity, the speed of light is the upper limit 
to the speed of an object, including rockets 
and spaceships. According to a new in- 
terpretation of the theory of relativity that I 
have recently developed, there is no upper 
limit to the speed that an object can attain. In 
fact, in my new interpretation of relativity I 
can 



a) account for the measured constant vel- 
ocity of light without having to mod- 
ify the normal concepts of time and 
space, 

b) furnish an explanation of all known 
electromagnetic phenomena, and 

c) allow speeds greater than 186,000 
milsec relative to the earth! 

If this new interpretation of relativity is 
correct, it has significant implications as to 
whether travel to the stars is practical, and as 
to what the future of industrial man could be. 

1 have presented this theory before a local 
student physics society (8 physics students 
and 2 college physics professors), and, after 
considerable discussion, they were not able 
to find any errors in the reasoning behind the 
theory or in the resulting equations. (The 
equations involve only algebra.) 

The question now arises: do you know of 
anyone knowledgeable in physics who would 
be interested in a new interpretation of re- 
lativity which accounts for all known elec- 
tromagnetic phenomena and which allows for 
interstellar space travel, possibly within a 
hundred years? Would you be interested? 

I am enclosing a copy of my resume. You 
can see from my background that I am not

Feedback, anyone? 

Hi, 

Just received my copy of April issue to- 
day. Thanks to Spider Robinson for his com- 
ents on Joan Vinge. She is a good writer; 
every good one needs the encouragement, for 
our sake as well as their own.

The main reason that I’m writing this 
though, is because of the circulation state- 
ment on page 112. There MUST be some- 
thing that we fans can do to increase the sub- 
scriptions of the magazine and get it out of 
the hands of the “distributors”. Perhaps we 
can use subscriptions for our birthday, and 
Christmas lists as much as possible. If each 
of us subscribed for, or encouraged one other 
to subscribe, it would double the paid-for 
copies. 40,000 returns from 93,800 printed is 
a horrible percentage of waste. If we fans get 
> behind this magazine we can save it. It will 
be for ourselves and new authors that we will 
be saving it. 

Sorry about the messy typing. If I wait to 
make it correct, it will never get into the 
mail. 

Keep up the good work, 
Marianne Turlington 

P.O. Box 23414

Actually, our percentage of returns is 
fairly low, as such things go-but by all 
means subscribe.' 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Your April ’77 issue touched on a subject 
that has been foremost on my mind for a 
long time now. 

This subject is apathy among sf fans. 
Perhaps the most pressing problem faced by 
the science fiction community is the one we 
create ourselves, by sitting around on our 
hands. I have always been rather vocal con- 
cerning subjects like money for the space 
program and genetic research, and I seldom 
or never hesitate to write my elected officials 
and tell them in detail what I think and why. 
As president of a modest-but-ambitious sci- 
ence fiction society, ORION, I have urged 
(and threatened, and commanded) members 
to do likewise. 

The a«//-space program factions are very 
vocal. When have you seen a political car- 
toon that presented a pro-recombinant genetic 
research stance? These are the harbingers of 
public sympathy by which Congress and the 
President — and the public — gauge the tide of 
voter opinion! The anti-science-and-technol- 

156 



ogy cultists are a loud and very visible 
group. Congressmen see and hear them. 
They listen to them. And then they cut the 
space budget, limit nuclear power plants, 
muzzle genetic research. WAKE VP 
PEOPLE! All that is necessary for evil to 
triumph is for good men to do nothing, to 
paraphrase somebody. 

Now, if I may change subjects abruptly, I 
would also like to voice interest in the matter 
of why there is such a lopsided ratio of 
female-to-male sf writers. / certainly don’t 
know why this state of affairs exists. I do 
know, from trying to recruit them for OR- 
ION and from a radio talk-show experience, 
that female sf readers are few and far bet- 
ween, and it is immediately obvious that to 
have female sf writers you must first have 
female sf readers. What do you ladies have 
to say about it? 

Finally, I personally would like to see the 
Alter-ego business dropped completely. 
There are more straightforward ways to ad- 
dress the things Geis has to say. The Alter 
angle pads the magazine with ugly literary 
fat. Sorry, Alter, but I cast my belated vote 
to give you the ax. 

Sincerely, 
Larry Cooper 
President, ORION 

1003 South Third 
Rogers, AR 72756 

Certainly those who feel strongly should 
write their congressmen-and their President, 
too. As for the malelfemale story ratio, these 
days it is fairly proportional to the 
malelfemale author ratio. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Before I start to complain, let me say that 
you produce an excellent magazine. Now let 
me get to the real point of my letter— Dhal- 
gren. 

It seems that of late there is a large group ' 
of people who get their thrills from saying 
how bad the novel really is. Well, I must say 
that although they are entitled to their own 
opinion, someone should be able to give 
equal time to the other point of view. 

I thoroughly enjoyed reading Dhalgren. 



GALAXY 



Enough so that I read it twice (completely 
yet!) and was never bored long enough to put 
the book down. Fortunately, the first time 1 
read it was just after it appeared on the 
stands, and before the hassle started, so 1 
wasn’t aware that 1 was reading trash. 

“Dhalgren has no plot!” people say. Well, 
1 thought it had a very good plot, granted 
that it was stretched out more than the nor- 
mal, run-of-the-mill novel. Is that really bad? 
I never heard anyone complain about Stein- 
beck’s The Grapes of Wrath having no plot. 
Or even The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand. 
Dhalgren has more plot than either of these. 

The point is that plot alone does not make 
a novel. (A short story maybe . ) 
Characterization is at least as important, 
perhaps moreso. Setting? Ditto. 

Obviously, a lot of people enjoyed Dhal- 
gren. The sales were (I understand) excellent, 
so someone must be reading it. 1 don’t mind 
people bitching when they have a valid com- 
plaint, but far too many people have had 
their negative opinions of Dhalgren published 
in virtually every SF publication. Somebody 
must stand up and say, “Thank you Mr. 
Delany.” 

Now that I have that off of my chest, I 
would like to say that I hope you can con- 
vince John Varley to write some more stories 
in his future history for your magazine. He is 
quite the excellent writer. He must already 
stand as one of the better writers in the field. 

Thank you for letting me express my 
opinions. 

Yours faithfully, 
John R. Little

Good, bad or indifferent, anything that at- 
tracts as much attention as Dhalgren has is 
almost by definition Significant. 

Dear Mr. Baen; 

After not having read an issue of 
GALAXY for awhile, I picked up a copy of 
the March issue and it’s the best damn 
magazine I’ve ever seen. I wonder what’s 
been going on in science fiction all this time? 



The stories have improved and the position of 
the genre is a markedly better one. 

Of course, I could ignore the rest of the is- 
sue, concentrating instead on Frederick 
Pohl’s story. Is each one of his stories abso- 
lutely individual? Except for what the reader 
knows he has in his hand when he reads a 
Pohl story, there’s no way to tell that they’re 
all written by the same author. This is as 
much of a trail-blazer as Edson McCann’s 
story way back in the ’50’s. I’m going to 
have to slip the first two installments out of 
somebody’s collection. 

And THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE 
SEA made it an issue instead of a story. I’ll 
be glad to pick up the next issue when it hits 
the stands. Who is Spider Robinson? Not one 
of a series in a phylum, I hope? At any rate, 
he has quite a novelty effect, and they tell 
me he maintains it in most stories. Will he 
have an anthology out? He seems like a 
can’t-miss author. 

Thanks for bringing me back to the sf 
field. 

Best, 
John Thiel 

Who is Spider Robinson? 
Er. .well. .it’s hard to say. / can only 
suggest that you keep reading Galaxy and 
form your own opinion! 

Dear Jim, 

At last! The March Galaxy finally arrived 
on the newsstand and I could finally finish 
Fred Pohl’s ‘Gateway’ serial! It must be five 
months since it started! 

Unfortunately, ’Gateway’ fizzled a little in 
the last episode; I only rated it A- instead 
of A-b for the first two-thirds, which had 
kept me re-reading it two or three times for 
clues. Who were the Heechee? How did the 
hero manage to get rich on the last trip while 
losing his girlfriend’s life? What secret did 
the computer-psychiatrist hold? 

Alas, the ending was a damp squib. I’d 
deduced, on the basis of the first episode, 
that Bob Broadhead got rich by discovering 
the Heechee home planet, thus answering the 
many puzzling questions about their dead 
civilization. 



DIRECTIONS 



157 



Still, maybe Fred Pohl is planning to re- 
veal all this in ‘Son of Gateway,’ after find- 
ing he had far too much Heechee-background 
to cram into just one novel. 

Be that as it may, I still think that the end- 
ing was dubious. I don’t see why they 
needed a whole ten people on such a risky 
trip, or why they’d pay an $18,500,000 
bonus for it. And, quite frankly, I think what 
really happened was that the other nine de- 
liberately planned to leave Broadhead behind 
on the doomed spaceship because he was 
such a rotten s.o.b. (and because it’d be nice 
to have at least one representative of hu- 
manity return if things miscarried), and they 
deliberately disconnected his ship’s firing 
button so it wouldn’t have worked anyway, 
so that the only reason he got back alive was 
get into print they’re several months out of 
date! 

Your truly, 
Glenn T. Wilson.

Why send that many people: because life is 
cheap, and that’s how many fit! As for the 
ending, the computer (speaking in its best 
hypothetical sense, of course) was saying 
that it is better to be even Robinette 
Broadhead than not to be at all. A switch- 
eroo ending perhaps: but a profound one. 

Messrs. Baen and Poumelle, 

As I write this, I have just finished watch- 
ing the N.B.C. special on radioactive waste. 
No doubt a lot of other people were watch- 
ing it as well. The report was presented as a 
good horror story with all the trappings of 
journalism, and many of the people watching 
it will no doubt be ruiming scared in the near 
future. The only positive things I saw in the 
whole report were the advertisements. 

The truth of the matter is, 1 believe, in 
nuclear power, and I’m frightened by the re- 
port. 

As an admittedly informed optimist, what 
does Dr. Poumelle have to say about 
radioactive waste material, aside from de- 



positing them in the Earth-Moon Trojan 
points?

Dear Jim, 

Perhaps your readers would wish to know 
of the existence of the British Science Fiction 
Association, the world’s largest sf society. 
We have been in existence since 1958 when 
a group of fans, writers and agents got to- 
gether to give British sf a sense of direction. 
We have grown slowly over the years and 
are now capable of extending our facilities to 
fans overseas. We already have numerous 
non-British members who not only receive 
the benefits of BSFA membership but who 
also contribute to our regular publications, 
VECTOR and MATRIX, our critical and 
news’ magazines. We also produce various 
other publications (a yearbook, an amateur 
writers’ zine, and assorted one-offs), and 
provide an sf information service, a tape li- 
brary, the world’s largest sf library and a 
fanzine service. The Association is a non- 
profit making one, run by a dedicated and 
active committee and supported by an 
equally active membership. Amongst our 
patrons are Arthurs C. Clarke, Bob Shaw 
and James White, and we can claim a 
number of equally well-known writers 
amongst our membership. The fee is £4 per 
year which entitles you to full membership 
and a regular bi-monthly posting. If you’re 
interested in joining a society where all the 
facets of the sf world are discussed regularly, 
write to me at the above address and I’ll 
provide any further details. 

Thanks for the opportunity. 

Yours appreciatively, 
David Wingrove.
