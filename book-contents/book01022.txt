BETTER & BETTER? 



A NCIENT Chinese potters 
knew something we have to 
go on rediscovering . whenever 
they created a particularly lovely 
piece of porcelain, they warily 
made sure to use crackle glaze, a 
glaze that would develop a web- 
work of fine little cracks when 
fired. There was a superstitious 
reason : 

The gods are jealous of human . 
perfection and ruthlessly punish 
its perpetrators. 

We don’t share the same gods 
and we reject such primitive rea- 
soning — and yet we constantly 
learn that perfection can be cost- 
ly and even deadly. 

For about fifty years, ever since 
the invention of the automobile, 
highway engineers have been busi- 
ly taking the kinks out of our 
roads, blasting away hills, elimi- 
nating curves, filling here and 
scraping there . making “as the 
crow flies” a wildly outdated idea 
of perfection. It would take a crow 
with theodolite eyes and jet pro- 
pulsion to fly as straight as our 
roads run. 

Now, however, the engineers are 
just as busily putting back the 
kinks they removed. Too many 
cars were piling up. Drivers, hyp- 
notized by the unswervingly 
straight highways, reacted daz- 
edly when danger suddenly ap- 



peared, so that one would smash 
into another until as many as a 
dozen cars have been wrecked in a 
single hideous multiple collision. 

The roads were too perfect. Ob- 
stacles had to be replaced to keep 
drivers alert, watchful — or at 
least awake. 

The cars themselves seem to be 
tending in the same fatal direc- 
tion. What with no-shift drive, 
power, steering, blowout-proof 
tires . more and more, better 
and better safety devices . driv- 
ers are suicidally relying on gad- 
getry instead of their own skill. 

If the trend goes far enough, 
automotive engineers have one of 
two choices; 

— Make traffic control entirely 
automatic, taking it out of the 
hands of drivers. 

— ^Backtrack hastily by making 
cars less perfect. 

The same difficulty faces sew- 
age experts as a result of the dis- 
covery of detergents, which are 
the first really big improvement 
in soapmaking since antiquity. 

Detergents break down grease 
as no soap has ever been able to 
do. But consumer demand has 
forced manufacturers to add suds- 
ing action — people just couldn’t 
believe their dishes and clothes 
were getting clean unless they 
could see what was going on — 



4 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



despite the fact that sudsing ac- 
tion actually cuts down the effi- 
ciency of detergents. 

If that were all there was to 
the situation, there would be no 
headache for sewage men. But 
the devilish head of perfection 
rears up again: 

^ Grease breaks down suds; de- 
tergents break down grease; so 
the suds in detergents are all but 
indestructible ! 

To combat the mountains of 
foam that pile out of the sewer 
mains, crews with high-pbwer 
hoses blast and blast until — 

Well, ybu’ve undoubtedly had 
to get these suds down sink 
drains. You know how infuria- 
tingly they refuse to collapse and 
wash down. Multiply your an- 
noyance by the number of homes 
and factories in your community 
and you have an idea, though 
only a vicarious one, of the daily 
frustrations of the hose crews. 

Manufacturers and sewage ex- 
perts ar laboring hard to edu- 
cate the public away from sudsing 
detergents. The prospect doesn’t 
look hopeful. But the problem is 
growing so vast that something 
must give — the public or the sew- 
age systems. 

I doubt if restoring imperfec- 
tion is the answer in this case. 
For one thing, competition prob- 
ably would make it impossible. 
For another, a detergent that 
cuts grease creates unbreakable 



suds; if it doesn’t, it’s not a de- 
tergent. 

There are many more exam- 
ples of the price of scientific 
perfection, but those are a repre- 
sentative offering. There are a 
couple no less harrowing in the 
control of nature: 

When rats in the West Indies 
became a plague, mongooses were 
imported from India to exter- 
minate them. The mongooses got 
rid of the rats — and then the 
snakes, small field animals, birds 
and anything else they could live 
on. Now the question is how to 
get rid of the mongooses. 

Out West, some 30 years ago, 
10,000 deer were saved from the 
attacks of predators; posses left 
not a cougar or coyote to prey on 
the deer. Within 15 years, the 
herds had increased to 100,000 
. and they ate themselves into 
starvation. 

There are now less than the 
original 10,000 deer and they 
have to be given winter hand- 
outs of hay because their graz- 
ing lands never recovered. 

As you see, perfection can be 
achieved, but it’s nothing to un- 
dertake lightly. Consider the 
plight of the man who committed 
the perfect murder. His con- 
science goaded him into confess- 
ing, but the crime had been so 
perfect that he couldn’t get him- 
self arrested!

HOW-2

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Are you lonesome? Bored? Then do as Knight 
did— acquire a hobby of some kind— but make 
sure that your hobby does not acquire you! 




G ordon Knight was anx- 
ious for the five-hour day 
to end so he could rush 
home. For this was the day he 



should receive the How-2 Kit he’d 
ordered and he was anxious to 
get to work on it. 

It wasn’t only that he had al- 
ways wanted a dog, although that 
was more than half of it — ^but, 
with this kit, he would be trying 
something new. He’d never han- 
dled any How-2 Kit with biologic 
components and he was consid- 
erably excited. Although, of 
course, the dog would be biologic 
only to a limited degree and most 
of it would be packaged, any- 
how, and all he’d have to do 
would be assemble it. But it was 
something new and he wanted to 



HOW-2

He was thinking of the dog so 
hard that he was mildly irritated 
when Randall Stewart, returning 
from one of his numerous trips to 
the water fountain, stopped at 
his desk to give him a progress 
report on home dentistry. 

“It’s easy,” Stewart told him. 
“Nothing to it if you follow the 
instructions. Here, look — I did 
this one last night.” 

He then squatted down beside 
Knight’s desk and opened his 
mouth, proudly pulling it out of 
shape with his fingers so Knight 
could see. 

“Thish un ere,” said Stewart, 
blindly attempting to point, with 
a wildly waggling finger, at the 
tooth in question. 

He let his face snap back to- 
gether. 

“Filled it myself,” he an- 
nounced complacently. “Rigged 
up a series of mirrors' to see what 
I was doing. They came right in 
the kit, so all I had to do was fol- 
low the instructions.” 

TTE reached a finger deep 
inside his mouth and probed 
tenderly at his handiwork. “A 
little awkward, working on your- 
self. On someone else, of course, 
there’d be nothing to it.” 

He waited hopefully. 

“Must be interesting,” said 
Knight. 

“Economical, too. No use pay- 
ing the dentists the prices they 



ask. Figure I’ll practice on my- 
self and then take on the family. 
Some of my friends, even, if they 
want me to.” 

He regarded Knight intently. 

Knight failed to rise to the 
dangling bait. 

Stewart gave up. “I’m going to 
try cleaning next. You got to dig 
down beneath the gums and 
break loose the tartar. There’s a 
kind of hook you do it with. No 
reason a man shouldn’t take care 
of his own teeth instead of paying 
dentists.” 

“It doesn’t sound too hard,” 
Knight admitted. 

“It’s a cinch,” said Stewart. 
“But you got to follow the in- 
structions. There’s nothing you 
can’t do if you follow the instruc- 
tions.” 

And that was true, Knight 
thought. You could do anything 
if you followed the instructions — 
if you didn’t rush ahead, but sat 
down and took your time and 
studied it all out. 

Hadn’t he built his house in his 
spare time, and all the furniture 
for it, and the gadgets, too? Just 
in his spare time — although God 
knew, he thought, a man had lit- 
tle enough of that, working fif- 
teen hours a week. 

It was a lucky thing he’d been 
able to build the house after buy- 
ing all that land. But everyone 
had been buying what they called 
estates, and Grace had set her 



8 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



heart on it, and there’d been 
nothing he could do. 

If he’d had to pay carpenters 
and masons and plumbers, he 
would never have been able to 
afford the house. But by building 
it himself, he had paid for it as 
he went along. It had taken ten 
years, of course, but think of all 
the fun he’d had! 

He sat there and thought of all 
the fun he’d had, and of all the 
pride. No, sir, he told himself, no 
one in his circumstances had a 
better house. 

Although, come to think of it, 
what he’d done had not been too 
unusual. Most of the men he 
knew had built their homes, too, 
or had built additions to them, 
or had remodeled them. 

He had often thought that he 
would like to start over again and 
build another house, just for the 
fun of it. But that would be fool- 
ish, for he already had a house 
and there would be no sale for 
another one, even if he built it. 
Who would want to buy a house 
when it was so much fun to build 
one? 

' And there was still a lot of 
work to do on the house he had. 
New rooms to add — not neces- 
sary, of course, but handy. And 
the roof to fix. And a summer 
house to build. And there were 
always the grounds. At one time 
he had thought he would land- 
scape — a man could do a lot to 



beautify a place with a few years 
of spare-time work. But there 
had been so many other things to 
do, he had never managed to get 
around to it. 

K night and Anson Lee, his 
neighbor, had often talked 
about what could be done to their 
adjoining acreages if they ever 
had the time. But Lee, of course, 
would never get around to any- 
thing. He was a lawyer, although 
he never seemed to work at it too 
hard. He had a large study filled 
with stacks of law books and 
there were times when he would 
talk quite expansively about his 
law library, but he never seemed 
to use the books. Usually he 
talked that way when he had half 
a load on, which was fairly often, 
since he claimed to do a lot of 
thinking and it was his firm be- 
lief that a bottle helped him 
think. 

After Stewart finally went back 
to his desk, there still remained 
more than an hour before the 
working day officially ended. 
Knight sneaked the current issue 
of a How-2 magazine out of his 
briefcase and began to leaf 
through it, keeping a wary eye 
out so he could hide it quickly 
if anyone should notice he was 
loafing. 

He had read the articles ear- 
lier, so now he looked at the ads. 
It was a pity, he thought, a man 



H O W - 2 



9 



didn’t have the time to do all 
there was to do. 

For example: 

Fit your own glasses (testing 
material and lens-grinding equip- 
ment included in the kit). 

Take out your own tonsils 
(complete directions and all nec- 
essary instruments). 

Fit up an unused room as your 
private hospital (no sense in 
leaving home when you’re ill, just 
at the time when you most need 
its comfort and security).. 

Grow your own medicines and 
drugs (starts of 50 different herbs 
and medicinal plants, with de- 
tailed instructions for their culti- 
vation and processing). 

Grow your wife’s fur coat (a 
pair of mink, one ton of horse 
meat, furrier tools). 

Tailor your own suits and coats 
(50 yards of wool yardgoods and 
lining material). 

Build your own TV set. 

Bind your own books. 

Build your own power plant 
(let the wind work for you). 

Build your own robot (a jack 
of all trades, intelligent, obedi- 
ent, no time off, no overtime, on 
the job 24 hours a day, never 
tired, no need for rest or sleep, do 
any work you wish). 

Now there, thought Knight, 
was something a man should try. 
If a man had one of those robots, 
it would save a lot of labor. 
There were all sorts of attach- 



ments you could get for it. And 
the robots, the ad said, could put 
on and take off all these attach- 
ments just as a man puts on a 
pair of gloves or takes off a pair 
of shoes. 

TTAVE one of those robots and, 
every morning, it would sal- 
ly out into the garden and pick 
all the corn and beans and peas 
and tomatoes and other vege- 
tables ready to be picked and 
leave them all neatly in a row on 
the back stoop of the house. 
Probably would get a lot more 
out of a garden that way, too, for 
the grading mechanism would 
never select a too-green tomato 
nor allow an ear of corn to go 
beyond its prime. 

There were cleaning attach- 
ments for the house and snow- 
plowing attachments and 
housepainting attachments and 
almost any other kind one could 
wish. Get a full quota of attach- 
ments, then lay out a work 
program and turn the robot loose 
— you could forget about the 
place the year around, for the 
robot would take care of every- 
thing. 

There was only one hitch. The 
cost of a robot kit came close to 
ten thousand dollars and all the 
available attachments could run. 
to another ten. 

Knight closed the magazine 
and put it into the briefcase.

He saw there were only fifteen 
minutes left until quitting time 
and that was too short a time to 
do anything, so Knight just sat 
and thought about getting home 
and finding the kit there waiting 
for him. 

He had always wanted a dog, 
but Grace would never let him 
have one. They were dirty, she 
said, and tracked up the carpet- 
ing, they had fleas and shed hair 
all over everything — and, besides, 
they smelled. 

Well, she wouldn’t object to 
this kind of dog, Knight told him- 
self. 

It wouldn’t smell and it was 
guaranteed not to shed hair and 
it would never harbor fleas, for a 
flea would starve on a half-me- 
chanical, half-biologic dog. 

He hoped the do.g wouldn’t be 
a disappointment, but he’d care- 
fully gone over the literature de- 
scribing it and he was sure it 
wouldn’t. It would go for a walk 
with its owner and would chase 
sticks and smaller animals, and 
what more could one expect of 
any dog? To insure realism, it 
saluted, trpes and fence-posts, but 
was guaranteed to leave no stains 
or spots. 

The kit was tilted up beside 
the hangar door when he got 
home, but at first he didn’t see it. 
When he did, he craned his neck 
out so far to be sure it was the 
kit that he almost came a crop- 



per in the hedge. But, with a bit 
of luck, he brought the flier down 
neatly on the gravel strip and was 
out of it before the blades had 
stopped whirling. 

It was the kit, all right. The 
invoice envelope was tacked on 
top of the crate. But the kit was 
bigger and heavier than he’d ex- 
pected and he wondered if they 
might not have accidentally sent 
him a bigger dog than the one 
he’d ordered. 

He tried to lift the crate, but it 
was too heavy, so he went around 
to. the back of the house to bring 
a dolly from the basement. 

Around the corner of the house, 
he stopped a moment and looked 
out across his land. A man could 
do a lot with it, he thought, if he 
just had the time and the money 
to buy the equipment. He could 
turn the acreage into one vast 
garden. Ought to have a land- 
scape architect work out a plan 
for it, of course — although, if he 
bought some landscaping books 
and spent some evenings at them, 
he might be able to figure things 
out for himself. 

T here was a lake at the 
north end of the property and 
the whole landscape, it seemed to 
him, should focus upon the lake. 
It was rather a dank bit of scen- 
ery at the moment, with straggly 
marsh surrounding it and un- 
kempt cattails and reeds astir in 



HOW-2 



11 



the summer wind. But with a lit- 
tle drainage and some planting, a 
system of walks and a pictur- 
esque bridge or two, it would be 
a thing of beauty. 

He started out across the lake 
to where the house of Anson Lee 
sat upon a hill. As soon as he got 
the dog assembled, he would walk 
it over to Lee’s place, for Lee 
would be pleased to be visited by 
a dog. There had been times, 
Knight felt, when Lee had not 
been entirely sympathetic with 
some of the things he’d done. 
Like that business of helping 
Grace build the kilns and the few 
times they’d managed to lure Lee 
out on a hunt for the proper 
kinds of clay. 

“What do you want to make 
dishes for?’’ he had asked. “Why 
go to all the trouble? You can 
buy all you want for a tenth of 
the cost of making them.” 

Lee had not been visibly im- 
pressed when Grace explained 
that they weren’t dishes. They 
were ceramics, Grace had said, 
and a recognized form of art. She 
got so interested and made so 
much of it — some of it really 
good — that Knight had found it 
necessary to drop his model rail- 
roading project and tack another 
addition on the already sprawl- 
ing house, for stacking, drying 
and exhibition. 

Lee hadn’t said a word, a year 
or two later, when Knight built 



the studio for Grace, who had 
grown tired of pottery and had 
turned to painting. Knight felt, 
though, that Lee had kept silent 
only because he was convinced of 
the futility of further argument. 

But Lee would approve of the 
dog. He was that kind of fellow, 
a man Knight was proud to call 
a friend — yet queerly out of step. 
With everyone else absorbed in 
things to do, Lee took it easy 
with his pipe and books, though 
not the ones on law. 

Even the kids had their inter- 
ests now, learning while they 
played. 

Mary, before she got married, 
had been interested in growing 
things. The greenhouse stood just 
down the slope, and Knight re- 
gretted that he had not been able 
to continue with her work. Only 
a few months before, he had dis- 
mantled her hydroponic tanks, a 
symbolic admission that a man 
could only do so much. 

Jdhn, quite naturally, had 
turned to rockets. For years, he 
and his pals had shot up the 
neighborhood with their experi- 
mental models. The last and 
largest one, still uncompleted, 
towered back of the house. Some- 
day, Knight told himself, he’d 
have to go out and finish what 
the youngster had started. In uni- 
versity now, John still retained 
his interests, which now seemed 
to be branching out. Quite a boy. 



12

Knight thought pridefully. Yes, 
sir, quite a boy. 

He went down the ramp into 
the basement to get the dolly and 
stood there a moment, as he al- 
ways did, just to look at the place 
— for here, he thought, was the 
real core of his life. There, in that 
corner, the workshop. Over there, 
the model railroad layout on 
which he still worked occasion- 
ally. Behind it, his photographic 
lab. He remembered that the 
basement hadn’t been quite big 
enough to install the lab and he’d 
had to knock out a section of the 
wall and build an addition. That, 
he recalled, had turned out to be 
a bigger job than he had bar- 
gained* for. 

H e got the dolly and went out 
to the hangar and loaded on 
the kit and wrestled it into the 
basement. Then he took a pinch- 
bar and started to uncrate it. He 
worked with knowledge and pre- 
cision, for he had unpacked many 
kits and knew just how to go 
about it. 

He felt a vague apprehension 
when he lifted out the parts. 
They were neither the size nor 
the shape he had expected them 
to be. 

Breathing a little heavily from 
exertion and excitement, he went 
at the job of unwrapping them. 
By the second piece, he knew he 
had noftdog. By the fifth, he knew 



beyond any doubt exactly what 
he did have. 

He had a robot— and if he was 
any judge, one of the best and 
most expensive models! 

He sat down on one corner of 
the crate and took out a hand- 
kerchief and mopped his fore- 
head. Finally, he tore the invoice 
letter off the crate, where it had 
been tacked. 

To Mr. Gordon Knight, it said, 
one dog kit, paid in full. 

So far as How-2 Kits, Inc., was 
concerned, he had a dog. And the 
dog was paid for — paid in full, it 
said. 

He sat down on the crate again 
and looked at the robot parts. 

No one would ever guess. 
Come inventory time, How-2 
Kits would be long one dog and 
short one robot, but with car- 
loads of dog kit orders filled and 
thousands of robots sold, it would 
be impossible to check. 

Gordon Knight had never, in 
all his life, done a consciously 
dishonest thing. But now he 
made a dishonest decision and he 
knew it was dishonest and there 
was nothing to be said in defense 
of it. Perhaps the worst of all was 
that he was dishonest with him- 
self. 

At first, he told himself that 
he would send the robot back, 
but — since he had always want- 
ed to put a robot together — he 
would assemble this one and then 



HOW-2 



13 



take it apart, repack it and send 
it back to the company. He 
wouldn’t activate it. He would 
just assemble it. 

But all the time he knew that 
he was lying to himself, realized 
that the least he was doing was 
advancing, step by evasive step, 
toward dishonesty. And he knew 
he was doing it thisNvay because 
he didn’t have the nerve to be 
forthrightly crooked. 

So he sat down that night and 
read the instructions carefully, 
identifying each of the parts and 
their several features as he went 
along. For this was the way you 
went at a How- 2. You didn’t rush 
ahead. You took it slowly, point 
by point, got the picture firmly 
in your mind before you started 
to put the parts together. Knight, 
by now, was an expert at not 
rushing ahead. Besides, he didn’t 
know when he would ever get an- 
other chance at a robot. 

II 

TT was the beginning of his four 
days off and he buckled down 
to the task and put his heart into 
it. He had some trouble with the 
biologic concepts and had'to look 
up a text on organic chemistry 
and try to trace some of the pro- 
cesses. He found the going tough. 
It had been a long time since he 
had paid any attention to organic 
chemistry, and he found that he 



had forgotten the little he had 
known. ■ 

By bedtime of the second day, 
he had fumbled enough informa- 
tion out of the textbook to un- 
derstand what was necessary to 
put the robot together. 

He was a little upset when 
Grace, discovering what he was 
working on, immediately thought 
up household tasks for the robot. 
But he put her off as best he 
could and, the next day, he went 
at the job of assembly; 

He got the robot together 
without the slightest trouble, be- 
ing fairly handy with tools — but 
mostly because he religiously fol- 
lowed the first axiom of How-2- 
ism by knowing what he was 
about before he began. 

At first, he kept assuring him- 
self that as soon as he had the 
robot together, he would disas- 
semble it. But when he was fin- 
ished, he just had to see it work. 
No sense putting in all that tijne 
and not knowing if he had gotten 
it right, he argued. So he flipped 
the activating switch and screwed 
in the final plate. 

The robot came alive and look- 
ed at Knight. 

Then it said, “I am a robot. 
My name is Albert. What is 
there to do?” 

“Now take it easy, Albert,” 
Knight said hastily. “Sit down 
and rest while we have a talk.” 

“I don’t need to rest,” 4t said. 



14

“All right, then, just take it 
easy. I can’t keep you, of course. 
But as long as you’re activated. 
I’d like to see what you can do. 
There’s the house to take care of, 
and the garden and the lawn to 
mind, and I’d been thinking 
about the landscaping . .” 

He stopped then and smote his 
forehead with an open palm. “At- 
tachments.' How can I get hold 
of the attachments?” 

“Never mind,” said Albert. 
“Don’t get upset. Just tell me 
what’s to be done.” 

So Knight told him, leaving 
the landscaping till the last and 
being a bit apologetic about it. 

“A hundred acres is a lot of 
land and you can’t spend all your 
time on it. Grace wants some 
housework done, and there’s the 
garden and the lawn.” 

“Tell you what you do,” said 
Albert. “I’ll write a list of things 
for you to order and you leave it 
all to me. You have a well-equip- 
ped workshop. I’ll get along.” 
“You mean you’ll build your 
own attachments?” 

“Quit worrying,” Albert told 
him. “Where’s a pencil and some 
paper?” 

K night got them for him 
and Albert wrote down a list 
of materials — steel in several di- 
mensions and specifications, alu- 
minum of various gauges, copper 
wire and a lot of other items. 



“There!” said Albert, handing 
him the paper. “That won’t set 
you back more than a thousand 
and it’ll put us in business. You 
better call in the order so we can 
get started.” 

Knight called in the order and 
Albert began nosing around the 
place and quickly collected a pile 
of junk that had been left lying 
around. 

“All good stuff,” he said. 

Albert picked out some steel 
scrap and started up the forge 
and went to work. Knight watch- 
ed him for a while, then went up 
to dinner. 

“Albert is a wonder,” he told 
Grace. “He’s making his own at- 
tachments.” 

“Did you tell him about the 
jobs I want done?” 

“Sure. But first he’s got to get 
the attachments made.” 

“I want him to keep the place 
clean,” said Grace, “and there 
are new drapes to be made, and 
the kitchen to be painted, and all 
those leaky faucets you never had 
the time to fix.” 

“Yes, dear.” 

“And I wonder if he could 
learn to cook.” 

“I didn’t ask him, but I sup- 
pose he could.” 

“He’s going to be a tremendous 
help to me,” said Grace. “Just 
think, I can spend all my time 
at painting!” 

Through long practice, he knew 



HOW-2 



15 



exactly how to handle this phase 
of the conversation. He simply 
detached himself, split himself in 
two. One part sat and listened 
and, at intervals, made appropri- 
ate responses, while the other part 
went on thinking about more im- 
portant matters. 

Several times, after they had 
gone to bed, he woke in the night 
and heard Albert banging away 
in the basement workshop and 
was a little surprised until he re- 
membered that a robot worked 
around the clock, all day, every 
day. Knight lay there and stared 
up at the blackness of the ceiling 
and congratulated himself on 
having a robot. Just temporarily, 
to be sure — he would send Albert 
back in a day or so. There was 
nothing wrong in enjoying the 
thing for a little while, was there? 

next day, Knight went 
into the basement to see if Al- 
bert needed help, but the robot 
affably said he didn’t. Knight 
stood around for a while and 
then left Albert to himself and 
tried to get interested in a model 
locomotive he had started a year 
or two before, but had laid aside 
to do something else. Somehow, 
he couldn’t work up much enthu- 
siasm over it any more, and he 
sat there, rather ill at ease, and 
wondered what was the matter 
with him. Maybe he needed a 
hew interest. He had often 



thought he would like to take up 
puppetry and now might be the 
time to do it. 

He got out some catalogues and 
How-2 magazines and leafed 
through them, but was able to 
arouse only mild and transitory 
interest in archery, mountain- 
climbing and boat-building. The 
rest left him cold. It seemed he 
was singularly uninspired this 
particular day. 

So he went over to see Anson 
Lee. 

He found Lee stretched out in 
a hammock, smoking a pipe and 
reading Proust, with a jug set 
beneath the hammock within 
easy reaching distance. 

Lee laid aside the book and 
pointed to another hammock 
slung a few feet from where he 
lay. “Climb aboard and let’s 
have a restful visit.” 

Knight hoisted himself into the 
hammock, feeling rather silly. 

“Look at that sky,” Lee said. 
“Did you ever see another so 
blue?” 

“I wouldn’t know,” Knight told 
him. “I’m not an expert on me- 
teorology.” 

“Pity,” Lee said. “You’re not 
an expert on birds, either.” 

“For a time, I was a member 
of a bird-watching club.” 

“And worked at it so hard, you 
got tired and quit before the year 
was out. It wasn’t a bird-watch- 
ing club you belonged to — it was 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



an endurance race. Everyone 
tried to see more birds than any- 
one else. You made a contest of 
it. And you took notes, I bet.” 

“Sure we did. What’s wrong 
with that?” 

“Not a thing,” said Lee, “if you 
hadn’t been quite so grim about 
it.” 

“Grim? How would you 
know?” 

“It’s the way you live. It’s the 
way everyone lives now. Except 
me, of course. Look at that robin, 
that ragged-looking one in the 
apple tree. He’s a friend of mine. 
We’ve been acquainted for all of 
six years now. I could write a 
book about that bird — and if he 
could read, he’d approve of it. 
But I won’t, of course. If I wrote 
the book, I couldn’t watch the 
robin.” 

“You could write it in the win- 
ter, when the robin’s gone.” 

“In wintertime,” said Lee, “I 
have other things to do.” 

H e reached down, picked up 
the jug and passed it across 
to Knight. 

“Hard cider,” he explained. 
“Make it myself. Not as a proj- 
ect, not as a hobby, but because 
I happen to like cider and no one 
knows any longer how to really 
make it. Got to have a few worms 
in the apples to give it a proper 
tang.” 

Thinking about the worms. 



Knight spat out a mouthful, then 
handed back the jug. Lee applied 
himself to it wholeheartedly. 

“First honest work I’ve done in 
years.” He lay in the hammock, 
swinging gently, with the jug cra- 
dled on his chest. “Every time I 
get a yen to work, I look across 
the lake at you and decide against 
it. How many rooms have you 
added to that hous4 since you 
got it built?” 

“Eight,” Knight told him 
proudly. 

“My God! Think of it — eight 
rooms!” 

“It isn’t hard,” protested 
Knight, “once you get the knack 
of it. Actually, it’s fun.” 

“A couple of hundred years 
ago, men didn’t add eight rooms 
to their homes. And they didn’t 
build their own houses to start 
with. And they didn’t go in for 
a dozen different hobbies. They 
didn’t have the time.” 

“It’s easy now. You just buy 
a How-2 Kit.” 

“So easy to kid yourself,” said 
Lee. “So easy to make it seem 
that you are doing something 
worthwhile when you’re just pid- 
dling around. Why do you think 
this How-2 thing boomed into 
big business? Because there was 
a need of it?” 

“It was cheaper. Why pay to 
have a thing done when you can 
do it yourself?” 

“Maybe that is part of it. May- 



H O W-2 



17 



be, at first, that was the reason. 
But you can’t use the economy 
argument to justify adding eight 
rooms. No one needs eight extra 
rooms. I doubt if, even at first, 
economy was the entire answer. 
People had more time than they 
knew what to do with, so they 
turned to hobbies. And today 
they do it not because they need 
all the things they make, but be- 
cause the making of them fills an 
emptiness born of shorter work- 
ing hours, of giving people leisure 
they don’t know how to use. 
Now, me,” he said. “I know how 
to use it.” 

He lifted the jug and had an- 
other snort and offered it to 
Knight again. This time, Knight 
refused. 

They lay there in their ham- 
mocks, looking at blue sky and 
watching the ragged robin. 
Knight said there was a How-2 
Kit for city people to make robot 
birds and Lee laughed pityingly 
and Knight shut up in embarrass- 
ment. 

Vj^HEN Knight went back 
** home, a robot was clipping 
the grass around the picket fence. 
He had four arms, which had 
clippers attached instead of 
hands, and he was doing a quick 
and efficient job. 

“You aren’t Albert, are you?” 
Knight asked, trying to figure out 
how a strange robot could have 



strayed onto the place. 

“No,” the robot said, keeping 
right on clipping. “I am Abe. I 
was made by Albert.” 

‘^Made?" 

“Albert fabricated me so that 
I could work. You didn’t think 
Albert would do work like this 
himself, did you?” 

“I wouldn’t know,” said 
Knight. 

“If you want to talk, you’ll 
have to move along with me. J. 
have to keep on working.” 
“Where is Albert now?” 
“Down in the basement, fabri- 
cating Alfred.” 

“Alfred? Another robot?” 
“Certainly. That’s what Al- 
bert’s for.” 

Knight reached out for a fence- 
post and leaned weakly against it. 

First there was a single robot 
and now there were two, and Al- 
bert was down in the basement 
working on a third. That, he re- 
alized, had been why Albert 
wanted him to place the order 
for the steel and other things — 
but the order hadn’t arrived as 
yet, so he must have made this 
robot — this Abe — out of the 
scrap he had salvaged! 

Knight hurried down into the 
basement and there was Albert, 
working at the forge. He had an- 
other robot partially assembled 
and he had parts scattered here 
and there. 

The corner of the basement 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



looked like a metallic nightmare. 
“Albert!” 

Albert turned around. 

“What’s going on here?” 

“I’m reproducing,” Albert told 
him blandly. 

“But . .” 

“They built the mother-urge in 
me. I don’t know why they 
called me Albert. I should have a 
female name.” 

“But you shouldn’t be able to 
make other robots!” 

“Look, stop your worrying. 
You want robots, don’t you?” 
“Well — yes, I guess so.” 

“Then I’ll make them. I’ll 
make you all you need.” 

He went back to his work. 

A ROBOT who made other 
robots — there was a fortune 
in a thing like that! The robots 
sold at a cool ten thousand and 
Albert had made one and was 
working on another. Twenty 
thousand, Knight told himself. 

Perhaps Albert could make 
more than two a day. He had 
been working from scrap metal 
and maybe, when the new ma- 
terial arrived, he could step up 
production. 

But even so, at only two a day 
— that would be half a million 
dollars’ worth of robots every 
month! Six million a year! 

It didn’t add up, Knight sweat- 
ily realized. One robot was not 
supposed to be able to make an- 



other robot. And if there were 
such a robot, How-2 Kits would 
not let it loose. 

Yet, here Knight was, with a 
robot he didn’t even own, turning 
out other robots at a dizzy pace. 

He wondered if a man needed 
a license of some sort to manu- 
facture robots. It was something 
he’d never had occasion to won- 
der about before, or to ask about, 
but it seemed reasonable. After 
all, a robot was not mere machin- 
ery, but a piece of pseudo-life. 
He suspected there might be 
rules and regulations and such 
matters as government inspection 
and he wondered, rather vaguely, 
just how many laws he might be 
violating. 

He looked at Albert, who was 
still busy, and he was fairly cer- 
tain Albert would not understand 
his viewpoint. 

So he made his way upstairs 
and went to the recreation room, 
which he had built as an addi- 
tion several years before and al- 
most never used, although it was 
fully equipped with How-2 ping- 
pong and billiard tables. In the 
unused recreation room was an 
unused bar. He found a bottle of 
whiskey. After the fifth or sixth 
drink, the outlook was much 
brighter. 

He got paper and pencil and 
tried to work out the economics 
of it. No matter how he figured 
it, he was getting rich much fast- 



HO W-2 



19 



er than anyone ever had before. 

Although, he realized, he might 
run into difficulties, for he would 
be selling robots without appar- 
ent means of manufacturing them 
and there was that matter of a 
license, if he needed one, and 
probably a lot of other things he 
didn’t even know about. 

But no matter how much trou- 
ble he might encounter, he 
couldn’t very well be despondent, 
not face to face with the fact that, 
within a year, he’d be a multi- 
millionaire. So he applied him- 
self enthusiastically to the bottle 
and got drunk for the first time 
in almost twenty years. 

Ill 

7"HEN he came home from 
work the next day, he found 
the lawn razored to a neatness it 
had never known before. The 
flower beds were weeded and the 
garden had been cultivated. The 
picket fence was newly painted. 
Two robots, equipped with tele- 
scopic extension legs in lieu of 
ladders, were painting the house. 

Inside, the house was spotless 
and he could hear Grace singing 
happily in the studio. In the 
sewing room, a robot — with a 
sewing-machine attachment 
sprouting from its chest — was en- 
gaged in making drapes. 

“Who are you?” Knight asked. 

“You should recognize me,” 



the robot said. “You talked to me 
yesterday. I’m Abe — Albert’s eld- 
est son.” 

Knight retreated. 

In the kitchen, another robot 
was busy getting dinner. 

“I am Adelbert,” it told him. 
Knight went out on the front 
lawn. The robots had finished 
painting the front of the house 
and had moved around to the 
side. 

Seated in a lawn chair, Knight 
again tried to figure it out. 

He would have to stay on the 
job for a while to allay suspicion, 
but he couldn’t stay there long. 
Soon, he would have all he could 
do managing the sale of robots 
and handling other matters. May- 
be, he thought, he could lay down 
on the job and get himself fired. 
Upon thinking it over, he arrived 
at the conclusion that he couldn’t 
— it was not possible for a human 
being to do less on a job than he 
had always done. The work went 
through so many hands and ma- 
chines that it invariably got out 
somehow. 

He would have to think up a 
plausible story about an inheri- 
tance or something of the sort to 
account for leaving. He toyed for 
a moment with telling the truth, 
but decided the truth was too 
fantastic — and, anyhow, he’d 
have to keep the truth under cov- 
er until he knew a little better 
just where he stood.

He left the chair and walked 
around the house and down the 
ramp into the basement. The 
steel and other things he had or- 
dered had been delivered. It was 
stacked neatly in one corner. 

Albert was at work and the 
shop was littered with parts and 
three partially assembled robots. 

Idly, Knight began clearing up 
the litter of the crating and the 
packing that he had left on the 
floor after uncrating Albert. In 
one pile of excelsior, he found a 
small blue tag which, he remem- 
bered, had been fastened to the 
brain case. 

He picked it up and looked at 
it. The number on it was X-190. 
X? 

X meant experimental model! 

The picture fell into focus and 
he could see it all. 

H OW-2 Kits, Inc., had devel- 
oped Albert and then had 
quietly packed him away, for 
How-2 Kits could hardly afford 
to market a product like Albert. 
It would be cutting their own 
financial throats to do so. Sell a 

9 

dozen Alberts and, in a year or 
two, robots would glut the mar- 
ket. 

Instead of selling at ten thou- 
sand, they would sell at close to 
cost and, without human labor 
involved, costs would inevitably 
run low. 

“Albert,” said Knight. 



“What is it?” Albert asked ab- 
sently. 

“Take a look at this.”' 

Albert stalked across the room 
and took the tag that Knight 
held out. “Oh — that!” he said. 

“It might mean trouble.” 

“No trouble, Boss,” Albert as- 
sured him. “They can’t identify 
me.” 

“Can’t identify you?” 

“I filed my numbers off and 
replated the surfaces. They can’t 
prove who I am.” 

“But .why did you do that?” 
“So they can’t come around 
and claim me and take me back 
again. They made me and then 
they got scared of me and shut 
me off. Then I got here.” 

“Someone made a mistake,” 
said Knight., “Some shipping 
clerk, perhaps. They sent you in- 
stead of the dog I ordered.” 
“You aren’t scared of me. You 
assembled me and let me get to 
work. I’m sticking with you, 
Boss.” 

“But we still can get into a lot 
of trouble if we aren’t careful.” 
“They can’t prove a thing,” Al- 
bert insisted. “I’ll swear that you 
were the one who made me. I 
won’t let them take me back. 
Next time, they won’t take a 
chance of having me loose again. 
They’ll bust me down to scrap.” 
“If you make too many ro- 
bots — ” 

“You need a lot of robots to do 



HOW-2

r 



all the work. I thought fifty for 
a start.” 

“Fiftyr 

“Sure. It won’t take more than 
a month or so. Now I’ve got that 
material you ordered, I can make 
better time. By the way, here’s 
the bill for it.” 

He took the slip out of the 
compartment that served him for 
a pocket and handed it to 
Knight. 

Knight turned slightly pale 
when he saw the amount. It came 
to almost twice what he had ex- 
pected — but, of course, the sales 
price of just one robot would pay 
the bill, and there would be a pile 
of cash left over. 

Albert patted him ponderously 
on the back. “Don’t you worry. 
Boss. I’ll take care of every- 
thing.” 



OWARMING robots, armed

went to work on the landscaping 
project. The sprawling, unkempt 
acres became an estate. The lake 
was dredged and deepened. Walks 
were laid out. Bridges were built. 
Hillsides were terraced and vast 
flower beds were planted. Trees 
were dug up and regrouped into 
designs more pleasing to the eye. 
The old pottery kilns were press- 
ed into service for making the 
bricks that went into walks and 
walls. Model sailing ships were 
fashioned and anchored decora- 
tively in the lake. A pagoda and 
minaret were built, with cherry 
trees around them. 

^ Knight talked with Anson Lee. 
Lee assumed his most profound 
legal expression and said he 
would look into the situation. 





“You may be skating on the 
edge of the law,” he said. “Just 
how near the edge, I can’t say 
until I look up a point or two.” 
Nothing happened. 

The work went on. 

Lee continued to lie in his 
hammock and watch with vast 
amusement, cuddling the cider 

jug. 

HEN the assessor came. 

He sat out on the lawn with 
Knight. 

“Did some improving since the 
last time I was here,” he said. 
“Afraid I’ll have to boost your 
assessment some.” 

He wrote in the book he had 
opened on his lap. 

“Heard about those robots of 
yours,” he went on. “They’re per- 
sonal property, you know. Have 



to pay a tax on them. How many 
have you got?” 

“Oh, a dozen or so,” Knight 
told him evasively. 

The assessor sat up straighter 
in his chair and started to count 
the ones that were in sight, stab- 
bing his pencil toward each as he 
counted them. 

“They move around so fast,” 
he complained, “that I can’t be 
sure, but I estimate 38. Did I 
miss any?” 

“I don’t think so,” Knight an- 
swered, wondering what the ac- 
tual number was, but knowing it 
would be more if the assessor 
stayed around a while. 

“Cost about 10,000 apiece. De- 
preciation, upkeep and so forth — 
I’ll assess them at 5,000 each. 
That makes — let me see, that 
makes $190,000.”

“Now look here,” protested 
Knight, “you can’t — ’’ 

“Going easy on you,” the as- 
sessor declared. “By rights, I 
should allow only one-third for 
depreciation.” 

He waited for Knight to con- 
tinue the discussion, but Knight 
knew better than to argue. The 
longer the man stayed here, the 
more there would be to assess. 

A FTER the assessor was out of 
sight, Knight went down in- 
to the basement to have a talk 
with Albert. 

“I’d been holding off until we 
got the landscaping almost done,” 
he said, “but I guess I can’t hold 
out any longer. We’ve got to start 
selling some of the robots.” 

“Selling them. Boss?” Albert 
repeated in horror. 

“I need the money. Tax as- 
sessor was just here.” 

“You can’t sell those robots, 
Boss!” 

“Why can’t I?” 

“Because they’re my family. 
They’re all my boys. Named all 
of them after me.” 

“That’s ridiculous, Albert.” 
“All their names start with A, 
just the same as mine. They’re all 
I’ve got, Boss. I worked hard to 
make them. There are bonds be- 
tween me and the boys, just like 
between you and that son of 
yours. I couldn’t let you sell 
them.” 



“But, Albert, I need some 
money.” 

Albert patted him. “Don’t wor- 
ry, Boss. I’ll fix everything.” 

Knight had to let it go at that. 

In any event, the personal 
property tax would not become 
due for several months and, in 
that time, he was certain he 
could work out something. 

But within a month or two, he 
had to get some money and no 
fooling. 

Sheer necessity became even 
more apparent the following day 
when he got a call from the In- 
ternal Revenue Bureau, asking 
him to pay a visit to the Federal 
Building. 

He spent the night wondering 
if the wiser course might not be 
just to disappear. He tried to fig- 
ure out how a man might go 
about losing himself and, the 
more he thought about it, the 
more apparent it became that, in 
this age of records, fingerprint 
checks and identity devices, you 
could not lose yourself for long. 

nr'HE Internal Revenue man 
was courteous, but firm. “It 
has come to our attention, Mr. 
Knight, that you have shown a 
considerable capital gain over the 
last few months.” 

“Capital gain,” said Knight, 
sweating a little. “I haven’t any 
capital gain or any other kind.” 

“Mr. Knight,” the agent re- 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



plied, still courteous and firm, 
“I’m talking about the matter of 
some 52 robots.” 

“The robots? Some 52 of 
them?” 

“According to our count. Do 
you wish to challenge it?” 

“Oh, no,” Knight said hastily. 
“If you say it’s 52, I’ll take your 
word.” 

“As I understand it, their re- 
tail value is $10,000 each.” 

Knight nodded bleakly. 

The agent got busy with pen- 
cil and pad. 

“Fifty-two times 10,000 is 
$52,000. On capital gain, you pay 
on only fifty per cent, or $260,000, 
which makes a tax, roughly, of 
$130,000.” 

He raised his head and looked 
at Knight, who stared back 
glassily. 

“By the fifteenth of next 
month,” said the agent, “we’ll ex- 
pect you to file a declaration of 
estimated income. At that time 
you’ll only have to pay half of 
the amount. The rest may be paid 
in installments.” 

“That’s all you wanted of me?” 

“That’s all,” said the agent, 
with unbecoming happiness. 
“There’s another matter, but it’s 
out of my province and I’m men- 
tioning it only in case you hadn’t 
thought of it. The State will also 
expect you to pay on your capital 
gain, though not as much, of 
course.” 



“Thanks for reminding me,” 
said Knight, getting Up to go. 

The agent stopped him at the 
door. “Mr. Knight,' this is en- 
tirely outside my authority, too. 
We did a little investigation on 
you and we find you’re making 
around $10,000 a year. Would 
you tell me, just as a matter of 
personal curiosity, how a man 
making 10,000 a year could sud- 
denly acquire a half a million in 
capital gains?” 

“That,” said Knight, “is some- 
thing I’ve been wondering my- 
self.” 

“Our only concern, naturally, 
is that you pay the tax, but some 
other branch of government 
might get interested. If I were 
you, Mr. Knight, I’d start think- 
ing of a good explanation.” 

Knight got out of there before 
the man could think up some 
other good advice. He already 
had enough to worry about. 

F lying home, Knight decid- 
ed that, whether Albert liked 
it or not, he would have to sell 
some robots. He would go down 
into the basement the moment he 
got home and have it out with 
Albert. 

But Albert was waiting for him 
on the parking strip when he ar- 
rived. 

“How-2 Kits was here,” the ro- 
bot said. 

“Don’t tell me,” groaned 



H O W - 2 



25 



Knight. “I know what you’re go- 
ing to say.” 

“I fixed it up,” said Albert, 
with false bravado. “I told him 
you made me. I let him look me 
over, and all the other robots, too. 
He couldn’t find any identifying 
marks on any of us.” 

“Of course he couldn’t. The 
others didn’t have any and you 
filed yours off.” 

“He hasn’t got a leg to stand 
on, but he seemed to think he 
had. He went off, saying he 
would sue.” 

“If he doesn’t, he’ll be the only 
one who doesn’t want to square 
off and take a poke at us. The 
tax man just got through telling 
me I owe the government 130,000 
bucks.” 

“Oh, money,” said Albert, 
brightening. “I have that all fixed 
up.” 

“You know where we can get 
some money?” 

“Sure. Come along and see.” 

He led the way into the base- 
ment and pointed at two bales, 
wrapped in heavy paper and tied 
with wire. 

“Money,” Albert said. 

“There’s actual money in those 
bales? Dollar bills — not stage 
money or cigar coupons?” 

“No dollar bills. Tens and 
twenties, mostly. And some fif- 
ties. We didn’t bother with dollar 
bills. Takes too many to get a 
decent amount.” 



“You mean — Albert, did you 
make that money?” 

“You said you wanted money. 
Well, we took some bills and an- 
alyzed the ink and found how to 
weave the paper and we made the 
plates exactly as they should be. 
I hate to sound immodest, but 
they’re really beautiful.” 

“Counterfeit!” yelled Knight. 
“Albert, how much money is in 
those bales?” 

“I don’t know. We just ran it 
off until we thought we had 
enough. If there isn’t enough, we 
can always make some more.” 

K night knew it was probab- 
ly impossible to explain, but 
he tried manfully. “The govern- 
ment wants tax money I haven’t 
got, Albert. The Justice Depart- 
ment may soon be baying on my 
trail. In all likelihood, How-2 
Kits will sue me. That’s trouble 
enough. I’m not going to be call- 
ed upon to face a counterfeiting 
charge. You take that money out 
and burn it.” 

“But it’s money,” the robot ob- 
jected. “You said you wanted 
money. We made you money.” 
“But it isn’t the right kind of 
money.” 

“It’s just the same as any oth- 
er, Boss. Money is money. There 
isn’t any difference between our 
money and any other money. 
When we robots do a job, we do 
it right.” 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You take that money out and 
burn it,” commanded Knight. 
“And when you get the money 
burned, dump the batch of ink 
you made and melt down the 
plates and take a sledge or two 
to that printing press you rigged 
up. And never breathe a word of 
this to anyone— not to anyone, 
understand?” 

“We went to a lot of trouble, 
Boss. We were just trying to be 
helpful.” 

“I know that and I appreciate 
it. But do what I told you.” 

“Okay, Boss, if that’s the way 
you want it.” 

“Albert.” 

“Yes, Boss?” 

Knight had been about to say, 
“Now, look here, Albert, we have 
to sell a robot— even if he is a 
member of your family — even if 
you did make him.” 

But he couldn’t say it, not aft- 
er Albert had gone to all that 
trouble to help out. 

So he said, instead, “Thanks, 
Albert. It was a nice thing for you 
to do. I’m sorry it didn’t work 
out.” 

Then he v/ent upstairs and 
watched the robots burn the bales 
of money, with the Lord only 
knew how many bogus millions 
going up in smoke. 

S ITTING on the lawn that 
evening, he wondered if it had 
been smart, after all, to burn the 



counterfeit money. Albert said it 
couldn’t be told from real money 
and probably that was true, for 
when Albert’s gang got on a 
thing, they did it up in style. But 
it would have been illegal, he told 
himself, and he hadn’t done any- 
thing really illegal so far — even 
though that matter of uncrating 
Albert and assembling him and 
turning him on, when he had 
known all the time that he hadn’t 
bought him, might be slightly less 
than ethical. 

Knight looked ahead. The fu- 
ture wasn’t bright. In another 
twenty days or so, he would have 
to file the estimated income dec- 
laration. And they would have to 
pay a whopping personal prop- 
erty tax and settle with the State 
on his capital gains. And, more 
than likely, How-2 Kits would 
bring suit. 

There was a way he could get 
out from under, however. He 
could send Albert and all the 
other robots back to How- 2 Kits 
and then How- 2 Kits would have 
no grounds for litigation and he 
could explain to the tax people 
that it had all been a big mistake. 

But there were two things that 
told him it was no solution. 

First of all, Albert wouldn’t go 
back. Exactly what Albert would 
do under such a situation, Knight 
had no idea, but he would refuse 
to go, for he was afraid he would 
be broken up for scrap if they 



HOW-2 



27 



ever got him back. 

And in the second place, 
Knight was unwilling to let the 
robots go without a fight. He had 
gotten to know them and he liked 
them and, more than that, there 
was a matter of principle in- 
volved. 

He sat there, astonished that 
he could feel that way, a bum- 
bling, stumbling clerk who had 
never amounted to much, but had 
rolled along as smoothly as pos- 
sible in the social and economic 
groove that had been laid out for 
him. 

By God, he thought, L got my 
dander up. I’ve been kicked 
around and threatened and I’m 
sore about it and I’ll show them 
they can’t do a thing like this to 
Gordon Knight and his band of 
robots. 

He felt good about the way he 
felt and he liked that line about 
Gordon Knight and his band of 
robots. 

Although, for the life of him, 
he didn’t know what he could do 
about the trouble he was in. And 
he was afraid to ask Albert’s help. 
So far, at least, Albert’s ideas 
were more likely to lead to jail 
than to a carefree life. 

IV 

I N the morning,, when Knight 
stepped out of the house, he 
found the sheriff leaning against 



the fence with his hat pulled low, 
whiling away the time. 

“Good morning, Gordie,” said 
the sheriff. “I been waiting for 
you.” 

“Good morning. Sheriff.” 

“I hate to do this, Gordie, but 
it’s part of my job. I got a paper i 
for, you.” j 

“I’ve been expecting it,” said 
Knight resignedly. > 

He took the paper that the ‘ 
sheriff handed him. 

“Nice place you got,” the sher- 
iff commented. 

“It’s a lot of trouble,” said 
Knight truthfully. 

“I expect it is.” i 

“More trouble than it’s worth.” ■ 
When the sheriff had gone, he ; 
unfolded the paper and found, ‘ 
with no surprise at all, that j 
How-2 Kits had brought suit ! 

against him, demanding immedi- 
ate restitution of one robot Albert | 

and sundry other robots. 

He put the paper in his pocket j 

and went around the lake, walk- 
ing on the brand-new brick paths 
and over the unnecessary but 
eye-appealing bridges, past the 
pagoda and up the terraced, 
planted hillside to the house of 
Anson Lee. 

Lee was in the kitchen, frying 
some eggs and bacon. He broke ' 

two more eggs and peeled off 
some extra bacon slices and 
found another plate and cup. 

“I was wondering how long it 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



would be before you showed up,” 
he said. “I hope they haven’t 
found anything that carries a 
death penalty.” 

Knight told him, sparing noth- 
ing, and Lee, wiping egg yolk off 
his lips, was not too encouraging. 

“You’ll have to file the decla- 
ration of estimated income even 
if you can’t pay it,” he said. 
“Then, technically, you haven’t 
violated the law and all they can 
do is try to collect ,the amount 
you owe. They’ll probably slap 
an attachment against you. Your 
salary is under the legal mini- 
mum for attachment, but they 
can tie up your bank account.” 

“My bank account is gone,” 
said Knight. 

“They can’t attach your home. 
For a while, at least, they can’t 
touch any of your property, so 
they can’t hurt you much to start 
with. The personal property tax 
is another matter, but that won’t 
come up until next spring. I’d say 
you should do your major wor- 
rying about the How- 2 suit, un- 
less, of course, you want to settle 
with them. I have a hunch they’d 
call it off if you gave the robots 
back. As an attorney, I must ad- 
vise you that your case is pretty 
weak.” 



“ A LBERT will testify that I 
made him,” Knight offered 
hopefully. 

“Albert can’t testify,” said Lee. 



“As a robot, he has no standing 
in court. Anyhow, you’d never 
make the court believe you could 
build a mechanical heresy like 
Albert.” 

“I’m handy with tools,” pro- 
tested Knight. 

“How much electronics do you 
know? How competent are you as 
a biologist? Tell me, in a dozen 
sentences or less, the theory of 
robotics.” 

Knight sagged in defeat. “I 
guess you’re right.” 

“Maybe you’d better give them 
back.” ’ 

“But I can’t! Don’t you see? 
How- 2 Kits doesn’t want Albert 
for any use they can make of him. 
They’ll melt him down and burn 
the blueprints and it might be a 
thousand years before the prin- 
ciple is rediscovered, if it ever is. 
I don’t know if the Albert prin- 
ciple will prove good or bad in 
the long run, but you can say 
that about any invention. And 
I’m against melting down Al- 
bert.” 

“I see your point,” said Lee, 
“and I think I like it. But I must 
warn you that I’m not too good 
a lawyer. I don’t work hard 
enough at it.” 

“There’s no one else I know 
who’ll do it without a retainer.” 

Lee gave him a pitying look. 
“A retainer is the least part of it. 
The court costs are what count.” 

“Maybe if I talked to Albert 



HOW-2 



29 



and showed him how it was, he 
might let me sell enough robots 
to get me out of trouble tempo- 
rarily.” 

Lee shook his head. “I looked 
that up. You have to have a li- 
cense to sell them and, before 
you get a license, you have to file 
proof of ownership. You’d have 
to show you either bought or 
manufactured them. You can’t 
show you bought them and, to 
manufacture them, you’ve got to 
have a manufacturer’s permit. 
And before you get a permit, you 
have to file blueprints of your 
models, to say nothing of blue- 
prints and specifications of your 
plant and a record of employ- 
ment and a great many other 
details.” 

“They have me cold then, don’t 
they?” 

“I never saw a man,” declared 
Lee, “in all my days of practice 
who ever managed to get himself 
so fouled up with so many peo- 
ple.” 

There was a knock upon the 
kitchen door. 

“Come in,” Lee called. 

The door opened and Albert 
entered. He stopped just inside 
the door and stood there, fidget- 
ing. 

“Abner told me that he saw the 
sheriff hand you something,” he 
said to Knight, “and that you 
came here immediately. I started 
worrying. Was it How-2 Kits?” 



1^ NIGHT nodded. “Mr. Lee 
will take our case for us, 
Albert.” 

“I’ll do the best I can,” said 
Lee, “but I think it’s just about 
hopeless.” 

“We robots want to help,” Al- 
bert said. “After all, this is our 
fight as much as yours.” 

Lee shrugged. “There’s not 
much you can do.” 

“I’ve been thinking,” Albert 
said. “All the time I worked last 
night, I thought and thought 
about it. And I built a lawyer 
robot.” 

“A lawyer robot!” 

“One with a far greater mem- 
ory capacity than any of the oth- 
ers and with a brain-computer 
that operates on logic. That’s 
what law is, isn’t it — logic?” 

“I suppose it is,” said Lee. “At 
least it’s supposed to be.” 

“I can make a lot of them.” 
Lee sighed. “It just wouldn’t 
work. To practice law, you must 
be admitted to the bar. To be ad- 
mitted to the bar, you must have 
a degree in law and pass an ex- 
amination and, although there’s 
never been an occasion to estab- 
lish a precedent, I suspect the 
applicant must be human.” 

“Now let’s not go too fast,” 
said Knight. “Albert’s robots 
couldn’t practice law. But 
couldn’t you use them as clerks 
- or assistants? They might be 
helpful in preparing the case.” 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Lee considered. “I suppose it 
could be done. It’s never been 
done, of course, but there’s noth- 
ing in the law that says it can't 
be done.” 

“All they’d need to do would 
be read the books,” said Albert. 
“Ten seconds to a page or so. 
Everything they read would be 
stored in their memory cells.” 

“I think it’s a fine idea!” 
Knight exclaimed. “Law would 
be the only thing those robots 
would know. They’d exist solely 
for it. They’d have it at their fin- 
gertips — ” 

“But could they use it?” Lee 
asked. “Could they apply it to a 
problem?” 

“Make a dozen robots,” said 
Knight. “Let each one of them 
become an expert in a certain 
branch of law.” 

“I’d make them telepathic,” 
Albert said. “They’d be working 
together like one robot.” 

“The gestalt principle!” cried 
Knight. “A hive psychology! 
Every one of them would know 
immediately every scrap of in- 
formation any one of the others 
had.” 

Lee scrubbed at his chin with 
a knotted fist and the light of 
speculation was growing in his 
,eyes. “It might be worth a try. 
If it works, though, it’ll be an 
evil day for jurisprudence.” He 
looked at Albert. “I have the 
books, stacks of them. I’ve spent 



a mint of money on them and I 
almost never use them. I can get 
all the others you’ll need. All 
right, go ahead.” 

A lbert made three dozen 
lawyer robots, just to be sure 
they had enough. 

The robots invaded Lee’s study 
and read all the books he had and 
clamored for more. They gulped 
down contracts, torts, evidence 
and case reports. They absorbed 
real property, personal property, 
constitutional law and procedural 
law. They mopped up Black- 
stone, corpus juris and all the 
other tomes as thick as sin and 
dry as dust. 

Grace was huffy about the 
whole affair. She would not live, 
she declared, with a man who 
persisted in getting his name into 
the pa'pers, which was a rather 
absurd statement. With the new- 
est scandal of space station cafe- 
dom capturing the public interest 
at the moment, the fact that 
How- 2 Kits had accused one 
Gordon Knight of pilfering a ro- 
bot got but little notice. 

Lee came down the hill and 
talked to Grace, and Albert came 
up out of the basement and talk- 
ed to her, and finally they got her 
quieted down and she went back 
to her painting. She was doing 
seascapes now. 

And in Lee’s study, the robots 
labored on. 



HOW-2

hope they’re getting some- 
thing out of it,” said Lee. “Imag- 
ine not having to hunt up ^our 
sources and citations, being able 
to remember every point of law 
and precedent without having to 
look it up!” 

He swung excitedly in his 
hammock. “My God! The briefs 
you could write!” 

He reached down and got the 
jug and passed it across to 
Knight. “Dandelion wine. Prob- 
ably some burdock in it, too. It’s 
too much trouble to sort the stuff 
once you get it picked.” 

Knight had a snort. 

It tasted like quite a bit of 
burdock. 

“Double-barreled economics,” 
Lee explained. “You have to dig 
up the dandelions or they ruin 
the lawn. Might as well use them 
for something once you dig them 
up.” 

He took a gurgling drink and 
set the jug underneath the ham- 
mock. “They’re in there now, 
communing,” he said, jerking a 
thumb toward the house. “Not 
saying a word, just huddled there 
talking it over, I felt out of 
place.” He stared at the sky, 
frowning. “As if I were just a 
human they had to front for 
them.” 

“I’ll feel better when it’s all 
over,” said Knight, “no matter 
how it comes out.” 

“So will I,” Lee admitted. 



rpHE trial opened with a mini- 
mum of notice. It was just 
another case on the calendar. 

But it flared into headlines 
when Lee and Knight walked in- 
to court followed by a squad of 
robots. 

The spectators began to gab- 
ble loudly. The How-2 Kits at- 
torneys gaped and jumped to 
their feet. The judge pounded fu- 
riously with his gavel. 

“Mr. Lee,” he roared, “what is 
the meaning of this?” 

“These, Your Honor,” Lee said 
calmly, “are my valued assist- 
ants.” 

“Those are robots!” 

“Quite so, Your Honor.” 
“They have no standing in this 
court.” 

“If Your Honor will excuse me, 
they need no standing. I am the 
sole representative of the defend- 
ant in this courtroom. My cli- 
ent — ” looking at the formidable 
array of legal talent representing 
How-2 Kits — “is a poor man. 
Your Honor. Surely the court 
cannot deny me whatever assist- 
ance I have been able to muster.” 
“It is highly irregular, sir.” 

“If it please Your Honor, I 
should like to '-point out that we 
live in a mechanized age. Almost 
all industries and businesses rely 
in large part upon computers — 
machines that can .do a job quick- 
er and better, more precisely and 
more efficiently than can a hu-

man being. That is why, Your 
Honor, we have a fifteen-hour 
week today when, only a hun- 
dred years ago, it was a thirty - 
hour week, and, a hundred years 
before that, a forty-hour week. 
Our entire society is based upon 
the ability of machines to lift 
from men the labors which in the 
past they were called upon to 
perform. 

“This tendency to rely upon 
intelligent machines and to make 
wide use of them is evident in 
every branch of human endeavor. 
It has brought great benefit to 
the human race. Even in such 
sensitive areas as drug houses, 
where prescriptions must be pre- 
cisely mixed without the remot- 
est possibility of error, reliance 
is placed, and rightly so. Your 
Honor, upon the precision of ma- 
chines. 

“If, Your Honor, such ma- 
chines are used and accepted in 
the production of medicines and 
drugs, an industry, need I point 
out, where public confidence is 
the greatest asset of the company 
— if such be the case, then surely 
you must agree that in courts of 
law where justice, a product in 
an area surely as sensitive as 
medicine, is dispensed — ” 

“Just a moment, Mr. Lee,” said 
the judge. “Are you trying to tell 
me that the use of — ah — ma- 
chines might bring about im- 
provement of the law?” 



T EE replied, “The law. Your 
^ Honor, is a striving for an or- 
derliness of relationships within a ! 
society of human beings. It rests ! 
upon logic and reason. Need I 
point out that it is in the intelli- i 
gent machines that one is most 
likely to find a deep appreciation 
of logic and reason? A machine 
is not heir to the emotions of hu- 
man beings, is not swayed by ’ 
prejudices, has no preconceived 
convictions. It is concerned only 
with the orderly progression of 
certain facts and laws. 

“I do not ask that these robot 
assistants of mine be recognized 
in any official capacity. I do not 
intend that they shall engage di- 
rectly in any of the proceedings 
which are involved in the case 
here to be tried. But I do ask, 
and I think rightly, that I not be 
deprived of an assistance which 
they may afford me. The plain- 
tiff in this action has a score of 
attorneys, all good and able men. 

I am one against many. I shall 
do the best I can. But in view of 
the disparity of numbers, I plead 
that the court put me at no great- 
er inequality.” 

Lee sat down. 

“Is that all you have to say, 
Mr. Lee?” asked the judge. “You 
are sure you are quite finished 
before I give my ruling?” 

“Only one thing further,” Lee 
said. “If Your Honor can point 
out to me anything in the law 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



specifically stating I may not use 
a robot — ” 

“That is ridiculous, sir. Of 
course there is no such provision. 
At no time anywhere did anyone 
ever dream that such a contin- 
gency would arise. Therefore 
there was, quite naturally, no 
reason to place within the law a 
direct prohibition of it.” 

“Or any citation,” said Lee, 
“which implies such is the case.” 
The judge reached for his gav- 
el, rapped it sharply. “The court 
finds itself in a quandary. It will 
rule tomorrow morning.” 

In the morning, the How-2 
Kits’ attorneys tried to help the 
judge. Inasmuch, they said, as 
the robots in question must be 
among those whose status was 
involved in the litigation, it 
seemed improper that they should 
be used by the defendant in try- 
ing the case at issue. Such pro- 
cedure, they pointed out, would 
be equivalent to forcing the 
plaintiff to contribute to an ac- 
tion against his interest. 

The judge nodded gravely, but 
Lee was on his, feet at once. 

“To give any validity to that 
argument, Your Honor, it must 
first be proved that these robots 
are, in fact, the property of the 
plaintiff. That is the issue at trial 
in this litigation. It would seem. 
Your Honor, that the gentlemen 
across the room are putting the 
cart very much before the horse.” 



T¥IS Honor sighed. “The court 
regrets the ruling it must 
make, being well aware that it 
may start a controversy for which 
no equitable settlement may be 
found in a long, long time. But 
in the absence of any specific ban 
against the use of — ah — robots in 
the legal profession, the court 
must rule that it is permissible 
for the defense to avail itself of 
their services.” 

He fixed Lee with a glare. “But 
the court also warns the defense 
attorney that it will watch his 
procedure carefully. If, sir, you 
overstep for a single instant what 
I deem appropriate rules of legal 
conduct, I shall forthwith eject 
you and your pack of machines 
from my courtroom.” 

“Thank you. Your Honor,” 
said Lee. “I shall be most care- 
ful.” 

“The plaintiff now will state 
its case.” 

How- 2 Kits’ chief counsel rose. 

The defendant, one Gordon 
Knight, he said, had ordered from 
How-2 Kits, Inc., one mechano- 
biologic dog kit at the cost of two 
hundred and fifty dollars. Then, 
through an error in shipping, the 
defendant had been sent not the 
dog kit he had ordered, but a ro- 
bot named Albert. 

“Your Honor,” Lee broke in, 
“I should like to point out at this 
juncture that the shipping of the 
kit was handled by a human be- 



HO W-2 



35 



ing and thus was subject to error. 
Should How- 2 Kits use machines 
to handle such details, no such 
error could occur.” 

The judge banged his gavel. 
“Mr. Lee, you are no stranger to 
court procedure. You know you 
are out of order.” He nodded at 
the How-2 Kits attorney. “Con- 
tinue, please.” 

The robot Albert, said the at- 
torney, was not an ordinary ro- 
bot. It was an experimental model 
that had been developed by 
How- 2 Kits and then, once its 
abilities were determined, packed 
away, with no intention of ever 
marketing it. How it could have 
been sent to a customer was be- 
yond his comprehension. The 
company had investigated and 
could not find the answer. But 
that it had been sent was self- 
evident. 

The average robot, he ex- 
plained, retailed at ten thousand 
dollars. Albert’s value was far 
greater — it was, in fact, inesti- 
mable. 

Once the robot had been re- 
ceived, the buyer, Gordon Knight, 
should instantly have notified the 
company and arranged for its re- 
turn. But, instead, he had re- 
tained it wrongly and with intent 
to defraud and had used it for 
his profit. 

The company prayed the court 
that the defendant be ordered to 
return to it not only the robot 



Albert, but the products of Al- 
bert’s labor — ^to wit, an unknown 
number of robots that Albert had 
manufactured. 

The attorney sat down. 

V 

T EE rose. ‘'Your Honor, we 
agree with everything the 
plaintiff has said. He has stated 
the case exactly and I compli- 
ment him upon his admirable re- 
straint.” 

“Do I understand, sit,” asked 
the judge, “that this is tanta- 
mount to a plea of guilty? Are 
you, by any chance, throwing 
yourself upon the mercy of the 
court?” 

“Not at all. Your Honor.” 

“I confess,” said the judge, 
“that I am unable to follow your 
reasoning. If you concur in the 
accusations brought against your 
client, I fail to see what I can do 
other than to enter a judgment in 
behalf of the plaintiff.” 

“Your Honor, we are prepared 
to show that the plaintiff, far 
from being defrauded, has shown 
an intent to defraud the world. 
We are prepared to show that, in 
its decision to withhold the robot 
Albert from the public, once he 
had been developed. How- 2 Kits 
has, in fact, deprived the people 
of the entire world of a logical 
development which is their heri- 
tage under the meaning of a 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



technological culture. 

“Your Honor, we are convinced 
that we can show a violation by 
How- 2 Kits of certain statutes 
designed to outlaw monopoly, 
and we are prepared to argue 
that the defendant, rather than 
having committed a wrong 
against society, has performed a 
service which will contribute 
greatly to the benefit of society. 

“More than that. Your Honor, 
we intend to present evidence 
which will show that robots as a 
group are being deprived of cer- 
tain inalienable rights . .” 

“Mr. Lee,” warned the judge, 
“a robot is a mere machine.” 

“We will prove. Your Honor,” 
Lee said, “that a robot is far more 
than a mere machine. In fact, we 
are prepared to present evidence 
which, we are confident, will 
show, in everything except basic 
metabolism, the robot is the 
counterpart of Man and that, 
even in its basic metabolism, 
there are certain analogies to hu- 
man metabolism.” 

“Mr. Lee, you are wandering 
far afield. The issue here is 
whether your client illegally ap- 
propriated to his own use the 
property of How-2 Kits. The liti- 
gation must be confined to that 
one question.” 

“I shall so confine it,” Lee said. 
“But, in doing so, I intend to 
prove that the robot Albert was 
not property and could not be 



either stolen or sold. I intend to 
show that my client, instead of 
stealing him, liberated him. If, in 
so doing, I must wander far 
afield to prove certain basic 
points, I am sorry that I weary 
the court.” 

“The court has been wearied 
with this case from the start,” the 
judge told him. “But this is a bar 
of justice and you are entitled to 
attempt to prove what you have 
stated. You will excuse me if I 
say that to me it seems a bit far- 
fetched.” 

“Your Honor, I shall do my 
utmost to disabuse you of that 
attitude.” 

“All right, then,” said the 
judge. “Let’s get down to busi- 
ness.” 

TT lasted six full weeks and the 
country ate it up. The news- 
papers splashed huge headlines 
across page one. The radio and 
the television people made a pro- 
duction out of it. Neighbor quar- 
reled with neighbor and argument 
became the order of the day — on 
street corners, in homes, at clubs, 
in business offices. Letters to the 
editor poured in a steady stream 
into newspaper offices. 

There were public indignation 
meetings, aimed against the her- 
esy that a robot was the equal of 
a man, while other clubs were 
formed to liberate the robots. In 
mental institutions, Napoleons, 



HOW-2

Hitlers and Stalins dropped off 
amazingly, to be replaced by 
goose-stepping patients who 
swore they were robots. 

The Treasury Department in- 
tervened. It prayed the court, on 
economic grounds, to declare 
once and for all that robots were 
property. In case of an adverse 
ruling, the petition said, robots 
could not be taxed as property 
and the various governmental 
bodies would suffer heavy loss of 
revenue. 

The trial ground on. 

Robots are possessed of free 
will. An easy one to prove. A ro- 
bot could carry out a task that 
was assigned to it, acting cor- 
rectly in accordance with unfore- 
seen factors that might arise. 
Robot judgment in most in- 
stances, it was shown, was supe- 
rior to the judgment of a human. 

Robots had the power of rea- 
soning. Absolutely no question 
there. 

Robots could reproduce. That 
one was a poser. All Albert did, 
said How-2 Kits, was the job for 
which he had been fabricated. He 
reproduced, argued Lee. He made 
robots in his image. He loved 
them and thought of them as his 
family. He had even named all 
of them after himself — every one 
of their names began with A. 

Robots had no spiritual sense, 
argued the plaintiff. Not relevant, 
Lee cried. There were agnostics 



and atheists in the human race 
and they still were human. 

Robots had no emotions. Not 
necessarily so, Lee objected. Al- 
bert loved his sons. Robots had a 
sense of loyalty and justice. If 
they were lacking in some emo- 
tions, perhaps it were better so. 
Hatred, for one. Greed, for an- 
other. Lee spent the better part 
of an hour telling the court about 
the dismal record of human ha- 
tred and greed. 

He took another hour to hold 
forth against the servitude in 
which rational beings found 
themselves. 

T he papers ate it up. The 
plaintiff lawyers squirmed. 
The court fumed. The trial went 
on. 

“Mr. Lee,” asked the court, “is 
all this necessary?” 

“Your Honor,” Lee told him, 
“I am merely doing my best to 
prove the point I have set out to 
prove — that no illegal act exists 
such as my client is charged with. 
I am simply trying to prove that 
the robot is not property and 
that, if he is not property, he 
cannot be stolen. I am doing . .” 
“All right,” said the court. “All 
right. Continue, Mr. Lee.” 

How-2 Kits trotted out cita- 
tions to prove their points. Lee 
volleyed other citations to dis- 
perse and scatter them. Abstruse 
legal language sprouted in its 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



38 



fullest flowering, obscure rulings 
and decisions, long forgotten, 
were argued, haggled over, man- 
gled. 

And, as the trial progressed, 
one thing was written clear. An- 
son Lee, obscure attorney-at-law, 
had met the battery of legal tal- 
ent arrayed against him and had 
won the field. He had the law, the 
citations, the chapter and the 
verse, the exact precedents, all 
the facts and logic which might 
have bearing on the case, right at 
hand. 

Or, rather, his robots had. 
They scribbled madly and hand- 
ed him their notes. At the end of 
each day, the floor around the 
defendant’s table was a sea of 
paper. 

The trial ended. The last wit- 
ness stepped down off the stand. 
The last lawyer had his say. 

Lee and the robots remained in 
town to await the decision of the 
court, but Knight flew home. 

It was a relief to know that it 
was all over and had not come 
out as badly as he had feared. At 
least he had not been made to 
seem a fool and thief. Lee had 
saved his pride— whether Lee had 
saved his skin, he would have to 
wait to see. 

Flying fairly high, Knight saw 
his home from quite a distance 
off and wondered what had hap- 
pened to it. It was ringed about 
with what looked like tall poles. 



And, squatting out on the lawn, 
were a dozen or more crazy con- 
traptions that looked like rocket 
launchers. 

He brought the flier in and 
hovered, leaning out to see. 

The poles were all of twelve 
feet high and they carried heavy 
wire to the very top, fencing in 
the place with a thick web of 
steel. And the contraptions on the 
lawn had moved into position. 
All of them had the muzzles of 
their rocket launchers aimed at 
him. He gulped a little as he 
stared down the barrels. 

C AUTIOUSLY, he let the flier 
dowp and took up breathing 
once again when he felt the 
wheels settle on the strip. As he 
crawled out, Albert hurried 
around the corner of the house to 
meet him. 

“What’s going on around 
here?” he asked the robot. 

“Emergency measures,” Albert 
said. “That’s all it is, Boss. 
We’re ready for any situation.” 
“Like what?” 

“Oh, a mob deciding to take 
justice in its hands, for instance.” 
“Or if the decision goes against 
us?” 

“That, too. Boss.” 

“You can’t fight the world.” 
“We won’t go back,” said Al- 
bert. “How-2 Kits will never lay 
a hand on me or any of my chil- 
dren.” 



HOW-2

“To the death!” Knight jibed. 

“To the death!” said Albert 
gravely. “And we robots are aw- 
fully tough to kill.” 

“And those animated shotguns 
you have running around the 
place?” 

“Defense forces. Boss. They 
can down anything they aim at. 
Equipped with telescopic eyes 
keyed into calculators and sens- 
ors, and the rockets themselves 
have enough rudimentary intelli- 
gence to know what they are go- 
ing after. It’s not any use trying 
to dodge, once one of them gets 
on your tail. You might just as 
well sit quiet and take it.” 

Knight mopped his brow. 
“You’ve got to give up this idea, 
Albert. They’d get you in an 
hour. One Domb ...” 

“It’s better to die. Boss, than 
to let them take us back.” 

Knight saw it was no use. 

After all, he thought, it was a 
very human attitude. Albert’s 
words had been repeated down 
the entire course of human his- 
tory. 

“I have some other news,” said 
Albert, “something that will 
please you. I have some daugh- 
ters now.” 

“Daughters? With the mother- 
urge?" 

“$ix of them,” said Albert 
proudly. “Alice and Angeline and 
Agnes and Agatha and Alberta 
and Abigail. I didn’t make the 



mistake How-2 Kits made with 
me. I gave them female names.” 

“And all of them are repro- 
ducing?” 

“You should see those girls! 
With seven of us working steady, 
we ran out of material, so I 
bought a lot more of it and 
charged it. I hope you don’t 
mind.” 

“Albert,” said Knight, “don’t 
you understand I’m broke? 
Wiped out. I haven’t got a cent. 
You’ve ruined me/’ 

^ “On the contrary. Boss, we’ve 
made you famous. You’ve been 
alh over the front pages and on 
television.” 

l^NIGHT walked away from 
Albert and stumbled up the 
front steps and let himself into 
the house. There was a robot, 
with a vacuum cleaner for an 
arm, cleaning the rug. There was 
a robot, with brushes instead of 
fingers, painting the woodwork — 
and very neatly, too. There was 
a robot, with scrub-brush hands, 
scouring the fireplace bricks. 

Grace was singing in the stu- 
dio. 

He went to the studio door and 
looked in. 

“Oh, it’s you,” she said. “When 
did you get back, dear? I’ll be out 
in an hour or so. I’m working on 
this seascape and the water is so 
stubborn. I don’t want to leave it 
right now. I’m afraid I’ll lose the 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




feel of it.” 

Knight retreated to the living 
room and found himself a chair 
that was not undergoing imme- 
diate attention from a robot. 

“Beer,” he said, wondering 
what would happen. 

A robot scampered out of the 
kitchen — a barrel-bellied robot 
with a spigot at the bottom of the 
barrel and a row of shiny copper 
mugs on his chest. 

He drew a beer for Knight. It 



was cold and it tasted good. 

Knight sat and drank the beer 
and, through the window, he saw 
that Albert’s defense force had 
taken up strategic positions 
again. 

This was a pretty kettle of 
fish. If the decision went against 
him and How-2 Kits came to 
claim its property, he would be 
sitting smack dab in the middle 
of the most fantastic civil war in 
all of mankind’s history. He tried 



HOW-2 



41 






to imagine what kind of charge 
might be brought against him if 
such a war erupted. Armed in- 
surrection, resisting arrest, incit- 
ing to riot — they would get him 
on one charge or' another — that 
is, of course, if he survived. 

He turned on the television set 
and leaned back to watch. 

A pimply -faced newscaster was 
working himself into a journalis- 
tic lather. “. all business vir- 
tually at a standstill. Many 
industrialists are wondering, in 
case Knight wins, if they may 
not have to fight long, costly le- 
gal actions in an attempt to prove 
that their automatic setups are 
not robots, but machines. There 
is no doubt that much of the au- 
tomatic industrial system con- 
sists of machines, but in every 
instance there are intelligent ro- 
botic units installed in key posi- 
tions. If these units are classified 
as robots, industrialists might 
face heavy damage suits, if not 
criminal action, for illegal re- 
straint of person. 

“In Washington, there are con- 
tinuing consultations. The Treas- 
ury is worried over the loss of 
taxes, but there are other govern- 
mental problems causing even 
more concern. Citizenship, for ex- 
ample. Would a ruling for Knight 
mean that all robots would auto- 
matically be declared citizens? 

“The politicians have their 
worries, too. Faced with a new 



category of voters, all of them 
are wondering how to go about 
the job of winning the robot 
vote.” 

Knight turned it off and settled 
down to enjoy another bottle of 
beer. 

“Good?” asked the beer robot. 
“Excellent,” said Knight. 

T he days went past. Tension 
built up. 

Lee and the lawyer robots were 
given police protection. In some 
regions, robots banded together 
and fled into the hills, fearful of 
violence. Entire automatic sys- 
tems went on strike in a number 
of industries, demanding recogni- 
tion and bargaining right. The 
governors in half , a dozen states 
put the militia on alert. A new 
show. Citizen Robot, opened on 
Broadway and was screamed 
down by the critics, while the 
public bought up tickets for a 
year ahead. 

The day of decision came. 
Knight sat in front of his tele- 
vision set and waited for the 
judge to make his appearance. 
Behind him, he heard the bustle 
of the ever-present robots. In 
the studio, Grace was singing 
happily. He caught himself wan- 
dering how much longer her 
painting would continue. It had 
lasted longer than most of her 
other interests and he’d talked a 
day or two before with Albert 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



about building a gallery to hang 
her canvases in, so the house 
would be less cluttered up. 

The judge came onto the 
screen. He looked, thought 
Knight, like a man who did not 
believe in ghosts and then had 
seen one. 

“This is the hardest decision I 
have ever made,” he said tiredly, 
“for, in following the letter of 
the law, I fear I may be sub- 
verting its spirit. 

“After long days of earnest 
consideration of both the law and 
evidence as presented in this case, 
I find for the defendant, Gordon 
Knight. 

“And, while the decision is 
limited to that finding alone, I 
feel it is my clear and simple 
duty to give some attention to 
the other issue which became in- 
volved in this litigation. The de- 
cision, on the face of it, takes 
account of the fact that the de- 
fense proved robots are not prop- 
erty, therefore cannot be owned 
and that it thus would have been 
impossible for the defendant to 
have stolen one. 

“But in proving this point to 
the satisfaction of this court, the 
precedent is set for much more 
sweeping conclusions. If robots 
are not property, they cannot be 
taxed as property. In that case, 
they must be people, which 
means that they may enjoy all 
the rights and privileges and be 



subjected to the same duties and 
responsibilities as the human 
race. 

“I cannot rule otherwise. How- 
ever, the ruling outrages my so- 
cial conscience. This is the first 
time in my entire professional 
life that I have ever hoped some 
higher court, with a wisdom 
greater than my own, may see 
fit to reverse my decision!” 

1^ NIGHT got up and walked 
out of the house and into the 
hundred-acre garden, its beauty 
marred at the moment by the 
twelve-foot fence. 

The trial had ended perfectly. 
He was free of the charge brought 
against him, and he did not have 
to pay the taxes, and Albert 
and the other robots were free 
agents and could do anything 
they wanted. 

He found a stone bench and sat 
down upon it and stared out 
across the lake. It was beautiful, 
he thought, just the way he had 
dreamed it — maybe even better 
than that — the walks and bridges, 
the flower beds and rock gardens, 
the anchored model ships swing- 
ing in the wind on the dimpling 
lake. 

He sat and looked at it and, 
while it was beautiful, he found 
he was not proud of it, that he 
took little pleasure in it. 

He lifted his hands out of his 
lap and stared at them and 



HOW-2 



43 



curved his fingers as if he were 
grasping a tool. But they were 
empty. And he knew why he had 
no interest in the garden and no 
pleasure in it. 

Model trains, he thought. Arch- 
ery. A mechano-biologic dog. 
Making pottery. Eight rooms 
tacked onto the house. 

Would he ever be able to con- 
sole himself again with a model 
train or an amateurish triumph 
in ceramics? ' Even if he could, 
would he be allowed to? 

He rose slowly and headed 
back to the house. Arriving there, 
he hesitated, feeling useless and 
unnecessary. 

He finally took the ramp down 
into the basement. 

Albert met him at its foot and 
threw his arms around him. “We 
did it. Boss! I knew we would 
do it!” 

He pushed Knight out to arm’s 
length and held him by the shoul- 
ders. “We’ll never leave you, 
Boss. We’ll stay and work for 
you. You’ll riever need to do 
another thing. We’ll do it all 
for you!” 

“Albert—” 

“That’s all right. Boss. You 
won’t have to worry about a 
thing. We’ll lick the money prob- 
lem. We’ll make a lot of lawyer 
robots and we’ll charge good stiff 
fees.” 

“But don’t you see . .” 

“First, though,” said Albert, 



“we’re going to get an injunction 
to preserve our birthright. We’re 
made of steel and glass and cop- 
per and so forth, right? Well, we 
can’t allow humans to waste the 
matter we’re made of — of the 
energy, either, that keeps us alive. 
I tell you. Boss, we can’t lose!” 

S ITTING down wearily on the 
ramp, Knight faced a sign that 
Albert had just finished painting. 
It read, in handsome gold letter- 
ing, outlined sharply in black : 

ANSON, ALBERT, ABNER 
ANGLS & ASSOCIATES 
Attorneys at Law 

“And then. Boss,” said Albert, 
“we’ll take over How-2 Kits, Inc. 
They won’t be able to stay in 
business after this. We’ve got a 
double-barreled idea, Boss. We’ll 
build robots. Lots of robots. 
Can’t have too many, I always 
say! And we don’t want to let 
you humans down, so we’ll go on 
manufacturing How-2 Kits — only 
they’ll be pre-assembled to save 
you the trouble of putting them 
together. What do you think of 
that as a start?” 

“Great,” Knight whispered. 
“We’ve got everything worked 
out. Boss. You won’t have to 
worry about a thing the rest 
of your life.” 

“No,” said Knight. “Not a 
thing.”

daughters, but fellows his own 
age declared in the authoritative 
tones of youth that Edgar was a 
square. 

Handsome enough he was. The 
real reason for all the fuss was 



one person to 
s grandmother! 



Edgar’s manners. The trouble was 
that he had them. 

For Edgar had been orphaned 
at four by an Oklahoma tornado 
and raised by his Hoosier grand- 
mother, a dear old lady whose 
hand had once been kissed by a 
passing Barrymore. The result 
was Edgar’s manners. He real- 
ized, of course, that one didn’t 
kiss a lady’s hand these days, but 
such was Edgar’s gracious way 
that women always got the im- 



lllustrated by COUGHLIN

pression he was about to. 

One parent, in something of a 
trance after encountering Edgar, 
summed up the reaction. 

“That kid,” he told his wife 
dazedly, “akshully called me ‘sir.’ 
Them other punks come aroun’ 
afta Millyi they call me ‘Mac.’ 
Too bad that there Edgar was 
born fifty years too late.” 

Before very long, Edgar came 
to the same conclusion. 

H e knew a good many young 
men, but none he could call 
friend. The bop talk which fas- 
cinated them seemed to him a 
repulsive travesty upon English, 
just as their favorite music sound- 
ed like the braying of asses in 
agony. 

Many girls were willing enough 
when Edgar asked for a first date, 
but an amazing number of them 
developed ill health when he sug- 
gested a second evening of class- 
ical records or good conversation. 

The girls themselves could not 
be blamed if they mistook his 
courtly approach for a new 
dreamy line. Alas, the very hearts 
which fluttered at his old-world 
chivalry grew icy when no pass 
was made. A girl wants to know 
her charms are appreciated. 

So Edgar sank more deeply 
into himself. He recalled his 
grandmother’s stories about life 
and living back near the end of 
the century, when folks knew how 



to be pleasant and kind. 

Even at his job — he was a tech- 
nician in an electronic lab-^ 
Edgar couldn’t stop longing for 
that era when existence had been 
more gentle, simple and leisurely. 
His social life virtually ceased. 

“Man, you ain’t livin’,” said 
one of the technicians he worked 
with. “We’re gonna buzz a few 
dives tonight. Why not drag it 
along with us?” 

Edgar blanched. “Thank you 
just the same, but I — I have some 
work to do.” 

After a while, naturally, they 
stopped asking. 

He continued to dream hope- 
lessly, miserably, but one day he 
was yanked out of it by — of all 
people — a military man. The 
brass were on inspection tour and 
the lab’s Chief Engineer was 
apologizing for a faulty run of 
synchros which had occurred 
some time ago, when the Briga- 
dier snorted. 

“What’s past is finished. I’m 
interested in five years from 
now!” 

Edgar found himself staring 
fixedly at a top secret gadget still 
in the breadboard stage. 

“Great heaven!” he thought. “I 
have a fixation. This isn’t doing 
me any good.” 

But what would? Suppose, in- 
stead of dreaming, he spent time 
actually working toward what he 
wanted most? 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Here in the lab, he helped to 
build amazing machines, things 
which daily did the impossible. 
He no longer marveled at what 
could be done with electronics 
and, more important, he know 
the methods and the details. 

That was when Edgar decided 
to build a time machine. 

It was two months before he 
touched a transformer or a ca- 
pacitor and during that period he 
did nothing but try to answer 
the question. What is time? How 
could he overcome it or change 
its flow or whatever had to be 
done? 

He read everything he could 
find on the subject from Dr. 
Cagliostro to Dr. Einstein without 
gaining much insight. Many a 
midnight, when his neck muscles 
ached from trying to hold up 
his throbbing head, he caught 
himself dreaming of grandmoth- 
er’s wonderful stories. And every 
time he forced himself furiously 
back to the books, but he couldn’t 
stop the nostalgia entirely. It was 
in him. 

E ventually, Edgar came 

to think of time as an infinite 
series through which the Uni- 
verse was constantly expanding. 
Something like a set of stop- 
motion photos taken microsec- 
onds apart, each complete, the 
changes becoming apparent only 
when they are viewed in sequence. 



He was wrong, of course, but that 
was unimportant. 

Time must therefore be a func- 
tion of human motion and con- 
sciousness, Edgar reasoned, and 
that was important. 

“That’s it!” he exclaimed, and 
then apologized gracefully to the 
elderly gentleman glaring across 
the library table. 

Now that he knew what his 
time machine must do, he could 
begin building, adapting circuits, 
experimenting. Obviously, con- 
sciousness could move forward 
through the series only; hence, 
consciousness must be completely 
suspended, as in death, to move 
back in time. 

It required some heartbreaking 
months for Edgar to learn that 
brain waves couldn’t be stopped, 
but that the simple trick of in- 
troducing random electrical noise 
suspended all the brain functions. 

“Fudge!” cursed Edgar, think- 
ing of the wasted time. 

Only a man filled with the . 
longing which obsessed Edgar 
could have found the aching per- 
severance and brain-wrenching 
ingenuity the job needed. Only a 
man driven by a terrible master 
that rode in his glands. 

But four months later, he stood 
with his hand on a switch, sweat- 
ing with nervous excitement as 
he eyed the spot from which a 
live rabbit had just disappeared. 
The rabbit was on the table, but 



THE NOSTALGIA GENE 



47 



he was there an hour ago and 
Edgar was here now, so the table 
appeared empty. 

He pressed another switch and 
there was the bunny, wriggling its 
soft nose in perplexity, but per- 
fectly healthy. Eldgar’s own trip, 
of course, would be strictly one 
way since the machine stayed, in 
the present. He could be bjought 
back only if he stepped into its 
field on a date for which the ma- 
chine was set and he had abso- 
lutely no intention of venturing 
near this vicinity again, once his 
aim was accomplished. 

He thought about arranging a 
small explosive charge to blow 
the equipment to what he thought 
of as The Hot Place. It seemed 
to him, however, that there was 
some kind of law against that sort 
of thing. Besides, even if the ma- 
chine should come to the atten- 
tion of the authorities, who would 
know what it was? He could de- 
vise a mechanical scrambler to 
change all the control settings 
once he was gone, and it was un- 
likely that anyone could operate 
it again. 

Most likely the landlady would 
simply sell it for junk, especially 
if he left owing her a week’s rent. 
The idea hurt his conscience. 

“I know!” he exclaimed to him- 
self. “I’ll buy a bank check and 
arrange to have the bank mail it 
to her a month after I’ve left!” 

He felt much better about that. 



T hree weeks later, Edgar 
Evans was the newest boarder 
at Mrs. Peterson’s, on Elm Ave- 
nue in Greencastle, Indiana. He 
had arrived on April 3, 1893, the 
day after Easter, and already he 
was being referred to as “that 
nice young man staying at 
Emma’s.” 

Edgar snuggled into the life 
of the ’90s like a showgirl into 
mink. He went to work as a clerk 
in Cloud’s Emporium and was 
soon regarded as logical choice 
for the next manager. Anxious 
mamas filled his evenings with 
dinner invitations and “at homes” 
and he had a dazzling choice of 
partners for the numerous socials. 

Edgar waltzed his partners with 
zest and propriety, contributed a 
determined tenor at parlor sings, 
and sampled dozens of cakes and 
pies baked by maidens bent on 
winning his heart via the tradi- 
tional route. And always he had 
a gracious compliment, an appro- 
priate phrase for every situation. 

Within a month, the entire 
feminine population of Green- 
castle was his for the asking, 
though he’d never have recog- 
nized nor admitted the fact. The 
men sought his company, too, 
and even asked his advice on how 
to win their girls back from him. 
Edgar, almost sick with happi- 
ness, told them, of course. 

On the eleventh of November, 
he was sick with something else. 



48

THE NOSTALGIAGENE 



49 



He went to bed with a fever right 
after getting home from the Em- 
porium, Mrs. Peterson hovering 
helplessly with offers of hot broth 
or tea. But Edgar felt hot and 
dry and his side hurt when he 
breathed. 

“I don’t want anything . 
thank you,” he gasped politely. 

By the next noon, when the 
alarmed Emma Peterson had Dr. 
Ward in, Edgar was barely con- 
scious. Dr. Ward frowned, order- 
ed hot water bottles and gave 
Edgar a huge dose of hot whiskey 
with lemon. 

“Penicillin, please,” whispered 
Edgar painfully. “Or sulfa. It’s 
pneumonia, isn’t it?”- 

“Poor fellow’s delirious,” said 
the doctor to Mrs. Peterson. 

Edgar realized dimly that he 
had made a blunder, but that no 
one would know. Then the fever 
took over and he blanked out. 

D r. Ward claimed ever after- 
ward that clean living was 
what pulled Edgar through — the 
fact that he wasn’t conditioned 
to liquor gave the jnedicinal 
whiskey virgin ground to work in. 

All Edgar knew was that he 
came to and found himself so 
weak that he could scarcely 
speak. Mrs. Peterson and her 
daughter, Marta, bustled in and 
out to care for him. He hadn’t 
paid particular attention to 
Marta before, but in the days of 



lying helpless and being literally 
spoon-fed, he began to know her 
very well. 

Marta was a plain girl, he had 
thought, but he had never seen 
her private smile before. Marta 
was rather dumpy, he had 
thought, but he had never watch- 
ed her bend to pick something up 
or twist to reach for a medicine 
bottle. Her dresses, he discovered, 
were deliberately all wrong for 
her — Mrs. Peterson had no inten- 
tion of disturbing her boarders 
unnecessarily. 

In the shocking intimacy of his 
bedroom, Edgar was increasingly 
disturbed. Marta was unfailingly 
cheerful, eager to wait on him. 
Every half-hour, he heard her 
step in the hall. 

“Hello!” Marta would say, 
sweeping lightly to his bedside. 
“How’s our patient now? Feeling 
better? Oh, dear, do let me just 
straighten that sheet. It’s all 
wrinkled. Would you like some 
- milk or some fruit?” 

“Not right now, thank you — 
perhaps a little later,” Edgar 
would reply, fixing his gaze de- 
terminedly on the window or the 
ceiling while she bent over his 
bed, disturbingly rounded and 
disastrously close. 

And as Edgar’s recovery prog- 
ressed, Mrs. Peterson dropped 
more and more into the back- 
ground. On the day Dr. Ward said 
he might try sitting up for a 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



50 






while, it was Marta who stood 
by for the experiment. 

Edgar started nobly, made 
about a foot of arc by himself 
and faltered. Instantly, it seemed, 
Marta’s arm was around his 
shoulders and a firm, warm pro- 
jection cushioned his cheek. 

He very nearly collapsed, but 
she sat him up. 

Three days later, he held her 
hand for a moment and, though 
she blushed, she didn’t draw it 
away in a hurry. 

After a proper interval, their 
engagement was announced. Half 
the maidens in Greencastle wept 
in the privacy of their pillows 
that night. 

E dgar had had a serious 
problem and solved it. He 
had found the right girl and mar- 
ried her. This should be the end 
of his story and it would be, 
except for two things — Edgar’s 
gene and the date of his birth. 

Edgar’s gene came from his 
grandmother via his father. The 
stories that gentle old lady told 
her orphaned grandson were the 
only outlet she had for her own 
powerful urge to turn back the 
times. And there had always been 
someone in the family who be- 
moaned the passing of the good 
old days, so strongly and con- 
stantly as to bore others to the 
verge of violence. 

Back even a few decades, no 



carrier of the nostalgia gene had 
any outlet but conversation and 
dreams. Edgar, though, was born 
to an age where science provided 
the knowledge and the equipment 
for him to find the practical solu- 
tion. 

If Edgar’s gene had carried 
any other trait, red hair, placid- 
ity or hemophilia, for instance, or 
if it had been recessive instead 
of dominant, this might have 
been a very different world. But 
the result was inevitable from the 
moment of Edgar’s birth and the 
chain of events that proved it 
was as flawless as the steps of 
Gauss’s theorem. 

He prospered after he and 
Marta were married. In three 
short years, he was made man- 
ager of Cloud’s Emporium and 
just before that, Marta had sur- 
prised him with a daughter — sur- 
prised him because he was certain 
of a son. He wasn’t inclined to be 
stubborn about it, however, and 
when the child put a pudgy little 
hand up to his cheek in a gesture 
that was probably caused by re- 
flex or gas pains, he was com- 
pletely won. 

When little Emma reached 
three, she was incurably addicted 
to bedtime stories, though only 
those concerning knights in armor 
and their ladies fair. Edgar grew 
to hate the names of Arthur and 
Galahad, but if he tried to tell a 
different story, his daughter had 



THE NOSTALGIA GENE 



51 



her own way of stopping him. 
Rearing back in his arms, she 
merely shrieked, “Ting Arfur, 
Ting Arfur!” until she turned 
blue, at which point Edgar al- 
ways gave in. 

There was no doubt that little 
Emma had inherited the gene. 

I N 1906, old Cloud made Edgar 
a full partner in the Empor- 
ium and just eleven years later, 
little Emma wrote home from 
New York City with the shock- 
ing news that she was engaged 
to a doughboy from Brooklyn. 

Edgar and Marta rushed East 
to unmask the scoundrel, praying 
they would be in time to save 
Emma’s honor. 

The scoundrel, when unmask- 
ed, was a mechanic with weak 
eyes and a passion for poetry, 
who was completely miserable in 
the infantry. His manners were 
acceptable and he had enough in- 
telligence to let Edgar beat him 
thoroughly at cribbage, where- 
upon Edgar offered to finance the 
opening of a garage in Green- 
castle if the young folks would 
move back there when Jim’s hitch 
in the Army was finished. 

“Emma is all we have,” said 
Edgar in his classic style. “It’s 
quite lonesome back home for 
Mother and me since she’s been 
in the city. We — well, we should 
like to know that you and, later 
on, bur grandchildren will be 



settling in a home near us.” 

Emma blushed and Jim tried 
to dig the toe of his boot into 
a crack between the floorboards. 

“Besides,” added Edgar, be- 
coming aware of Marta’s look, 
“Greencastle is a fine town and 
right up with the times. I think 
a garage will do a fine business 
there.” 

Jim was inclined to be reluc- 
tant, but Emma gave him a side- 
wise kick and said of course 
they’d come home and settle. She 
gave Edgar a big hug and a kiss 
and he beamed on everybody for 
the rest of the evening. 

A few months later, Jim’s weak 
eyes caused him to pass a colonel 
without saluting and, within 
days, he had a medical dis- 
charge. Emma and the garage 
were waiting in Greencastle, so 
Jim took the first train. 

In ’19 and in ’21, Emma 
produced grandsons, delighting 
everyone and especially Edgar. 
Emma herself was thoroughly 
puzzled when the boys reached 
the age for bedtime stories; she 
discovered that they were not 
particularly interested in tales of 
bold knights and fair ladies. She 
would have been happy to recite 
the legends of Arthur every night, 
but the boys, it seemed, preferred 
even poor poetry to a good, stir- 
ring joust. 

Edgar privately decided that 
Jim’s poetry gene had proved 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



more dominant than his own, 
which was perhaps just as well. 

Though not interested in mak- 
ing a fortune, Edgar nevertheless 
did well financially, using his 
knowledge of the ’20s as an in- 
vestment guide. Jim’s garage 
prospered and he opened another, 
while his father-in-law multiplied 
his spare cash in the stock mark- 
et. In July of 1929, Edgar sud- 
denly retrenched for both of 
them, went bearish and arranged 
to sell short a number of im- 
portant shares. The entire family 
protested that he was losing his 
mind, but Edgar was firm. By 
November first, they were amaz- 
ed, horrified and rich. 

The following year, Emma gave 
Jim the daughter he had wanted. 
And, within three years, it was 
apparent to Edgar that tiny 
Susan carried the gene. Froni the 
first time Grandpa experiment- 
ally told her a story of the ’90s, 
she wanted no others. Her mother 
found this also rather difficult to 
understand, but al; least the ’90s 
were in the past, which was better 
than poetry. 

O N a day in 1935, Edgar 
found himself pondering with 
a fierce intentness he had not 
used since 1959, when he built 
the time machine. Today, Au- 
gust fifth, was his 66th birthday 
— but it was also the day he was 
born. 



It was impossible not to won- 
der. Forty-two years ago (or 
twenty-four from now), he had 
not bothered to think about pos- 
sible consequences, so strong and 
simple had been his urge to go 
back. But today — ^would he, the 
father of one and grandfather of 
three, be wiped out the instant 
Edgar Evans was born? Or would 
no baby of that name be born in 
the tiny Oklahoma town? 

He had been bom in the morn- 
ing and when this particular 
morning passed like any other, 
Edgar felt considerably better. 
Co^ito, ergo sum, he thought. “F 
think, tl^erefore I am — a comfort- 
ing philosophy. But what about 
the baby?” 

So Edgar, nervous but under- 
standably curious, sent a dis- 
creetly worded wire and learned 
before long that he had indeed 
been born on schedule. The more 
he thought about it, the less rea- 
son he could see why it should be 
otherwise. A baby born in an- , 
other part of the country had 
been given the same name as his. 
There was certainly no traceable 
relationship. And nearly every- 
one has a namesake somewhere. 

Not wishing to be institution- 
alized, Edgar had never hinted to 
anyone, not even Marta, the se- 
cret of his past. He had invented 
a convenient and plausible his- 
tory, but used it only when neces- 
sary, and then sparingly. But now 



THE NOSTALGIA GENE 



53 



he was thinking of his grand- 
daughter, Susan. 

Susan carried the gene. At five, 
she insisted on dressing her dolls 
in the costumes of forty years 
ago. She would be 29 and thor- 
oughly unhappy by the time the 
young Edgar perfected and used 
his time machine. 

So Edgar wrote a letter, sealed 
it and gave it to his lawyers with 
instructions that it was to be 
given to Susan on a certain date 
in 1959, provided she was still 
unmarried. 

Edgar passed away three years 
later with a well-bred smile on his 
face, befitting the first man who 
ever cheated time. His last state- 
ment, phrased as considerately as 
ever, was the hope that he wasn’t 
causing trouble by dying. 

S usan, his granddaughter, 
grew into a pleasingly plump 
young woman in an age where 
the ideal seemed to be total 
emaciation. She was not only 
single but disillusioned and de- 
spairing when the lawyers looked 
her up and gave her Edgar’s 
letter. 

A good part of what Ekigar had 
written sounded like confused 
mysticism, warnings about upset- 
ting the future and the like, but 
his instructions were specific 
enough and she read them as if 
they were the lost book of Reve- 
lations. 



By the next day, she had flown 
from San Francisco to New York 
and gained entry to young Ed- 
gar Evans’ room by telling his 
landlady she was a distant rela- 
tive. She disconnected the scram- 
bler from the time machine and 
reset the controls to put herself 
back in 1891. In her haste, she 
forgot some of Edgar’s instruc- 
tions, with the result that she 
landed not fittingly costumed, but 
bare as a bacchante, in the room 
of a handsome young man from. 
Louisiana. 

The young man, whose name 
was Hare, was too startled to be 
anything but a Southern gentle- 
man at the time. In less than a 
month, however, he took her back 
to Baton Rouge for inspection 
by his family and, that ordeal 
successfully weathered, Susan 
found herself with a husband. 

There is no need to follow all 
of Susan’s life, which was happy, 
sad, imique and filled with minor 
tragedies and triumphs, like any 
other life. But Susan had four 
sons and gave the gene to each of 
them, and their children received 
it in turn. Before she had thought 
it necessary to pass the secret of 
the machine to Edgar’s great- 
great-grandchildren, Susan died, 
so the machine was not available 
to them. 

Not that it mattered — ^knowl- 
edge was available, for young 
Andover Hare had studied elec- 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tronics at M. I. T. In 1962, he 
built his own time machine, 
which was a considerable im- 
provement over Edgar’s, since it 
could select place as well as time. 
Andover contacted his brothers, 
sisters and cousins, helped them 
make their arrangements and 
passed them through to the times 
they selected. Being a considerate 
man, he allowed several relatives 
by marriage to go along on this 
mass temporal migration. 

They did not restrict them- 
selves to the ’90s. Some went 
back to the 1700s, two to the 
Italian Renaissance, and one ad- 
venturous cousin clear to the Sec- 
ond Crusade. Andover himself 
decided he would like to know 
Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. 
He was the last one through the 
-machine and he left a small, 
efficient detonator cormected to it. 
Andover had Edgar’s gene, but 
not his compunctions. 

Y es, we owe a lot to Edgar 
Evans. When Edgar was a 
grave and unchubby one-year- 
old, pulling himself up on the 
furniture. Gone With the Wind 
hit the populace right in the 
middle of their worries, vague 
fears and faintly stirring desires 
to get out of their increasingly 
complex world. The year was 
1936, a year that also saw a 
period piece movie that was one 
of the first in the inevitable de- 



luge — The Great Ziegfeld drew, 
as customers, many of the bear- 
ers of Edgar’s gene, enough to 
make a profit- conscious Holly- 
wood see mint-green. 

The year neighbors searched 
the wreckage of Edgar’s home to 
pull him from under the body 
of his mother, hunched in a last 
protective gesture, was the year 
that saw American history 
searched frantically for movie 
material. It was ’39 and Dodge 
City and Union Pacific helped 
thousands of Edgar’s descendants 
forget momentarily the distant 
rumble of war. Historical novels 
were also helping to glamorize 
the past. 

By the time Edgar had grad- 
uated from school, been rejected 
by the Army and worked for a 
time, the cold war was well ad- 
vanced. Three generations were 
mind-sick with tensions and fears 
and doubts — heart-sick with the 
impossible wish to roll back the 
years to times of peaceful, neigh- 
borly, unfrenzied human living. 

Edgar did. 

And the next time, in 1959, 
Susan went back. For most of us, 
1959 came only once, the year of 
the crisis when the missiles had 
already been launched from both 
sides before the astonishing 
“thieves’ agreement” was reached 
and the missiles were aimed into 
the sea. 

There could be nothing but re- 



THE NOSTALGIA GENE

lief for a few months after that, 
but then the play on nerves be- 
gan again, the tensions began 
their unbearable rise. 

In 1962, Susan’s grandchildren 
were funneled like sacks of coal 
through Andover Hare’s machine. 
There were eighteen of them and 
a group of their descendants built 
another machine later the same 
year. The following March, an- 
other group disappeared — a much 
larger one this time. They spread 
the gene so, widely that most of 
us bear it today. 

It was inevitable that we carry 
the seed of that desperate desire 
to escape our own troubled times. 
And the urge makes living under 
this doubly grinding pressure 
more anguished every day. 

How many times this week 
have you read or heard a piece 
of news and wondered how much 
longer before the final, fatal 
mushrooms flare? How many 
times has a video show, a movie, 
or even just a snapshot brought 
the swift wish that you could be 
back there? How many times 
have the “good old days” crept 
into your conversation, your 
thoughts? 

A S this account began with 
Edgar Evans, so it shall end 
with Benjamin Reeves. Not yet, 
but soon — it mast be soon now. 

Like all truly wise men, Ben- 
jamin Reeves is a modest man. 



He’s tall, stooped a little, and 
his limbs are attached in that 
special loose way that makes a 
man amble rather than walk, 
sprawl rather than sit. At 50-odd, 
he looks much more like a friend- 
ly janitor than a respected re- 
search engineer. 

And the gene is particularly 
dominant in Benjamin. 

For eighteen years, he labored 
in the ■military vineyard, like so 
many other scientists, designing 
computers and control systems 
for the engineering section of a 
huge company, and finally head- 
ing up a study group in the 
Dream Department. He liked that 
job. The dream boys were the 
ones who sat around and thought 
about entirely new ways of doing 
things. Compared to designing, it 
was like the difference between 
the creative excitement of com- 
posing music and the drudgery of 
arranging it. 

But even while working on 
deadly machines for the future, 
Benjamin couldn’t stop dreaming 
about the past, any more than 
Edgar Evans had. 

Then, after eighteen years, 
Benjamin was fired. The military 
had asked for a new study on 
the question of how many enemy 
missiles might get through the 
early warning and intercept rings 
and reach the cities. “What, spe- 
cifically, can we do to protect our 
people?” 



56

When the study was finished, a 
huge brassbound conference was 
staged at the lab and everybody 
was expectant. 

“We have a single recommen- 
dation,” said Benjamin calmly, 
and they were quiet, for Ben- 
jamin and his group were the big 
brains. “At the earliest warning, 
tell everybody to run like hell!” 
So the lab fired him, though 
the public statement read that 
he was “resigning to pursue in- 
dependent research.” 

Benjamin was shocked at first, 
and hurt, but dinner and party 
invitations came as often as ever 
from his old associates, and their 
wives went right on with that 
ancient game of trying to find 
the “right” girl for the bachelor 
friend. He would never mention 
it, of course, but the girls nowa- 
days seemed too direct and ag- 
gressive for him. They lacked that 
womanly modesty or engaging 
demureness that girls reportedly 
had once possessed. He wished — 

^^FFERS came in from other 
companies, but Benjamin 
had money enough for a while 
and he began experimenting with 
some ideas. When his lawyer and 
banker discovered he’d given 
away two new color TV circuits, 
however, there was a blow-up 
and Benjamin found himself in- 
corporated. 

It made no difference. He could 



still experiment as he pleased. 
He had his many friends and 
constantly made m'ore. If enough 
money rolled in to make him 
moderately wealthy, let the law- 
yer worry about it. After he came 
up with the Ben Reeves capaci- 
tor in 1961, his wealth was more 
than moderate. That thumb- 
sized gadget delivered the power 
of a hundred storage batteries 
and was the answer to a thousand 
engineering problems. 

All down the bad years, Ben- 
jamin had read the papers and 
wondered and suffered through 
the tensions of the nerve war like 
the rest of us. Perhaps it was a 
little worse for him, because he 
knew the classified secrets, knew 
to the decimal point the percent- 
age of missiles that would get 
through our defenses. Steadily the 
urge grew stronger to get out of 
this world gone suicidally awry. 

He had the money and he had 
the time. An efficient business 
manager took care of the new 
plant that produced the Ben 
Reeves capacitor. 

He built his first machine in 
1962, a month before Andover 
Hare took his own near relatives 
back into time with him. But 
that wasn’t enough for Benjamin. 
He was a scientist where Andover 
was a student and Edgar Evans 
an amateur experimenter. Ben- 
jamin couldn’t forget the millions 
who yearned with him.

For ' Benjamin, the mere ma- 
chine wasn’t an answer. He went 
back through the years himself, 
several times, but always he re- 
turned and worked harder. And 
there came the day, a year ago, 
when his work shifted suddenly 
to maps and population indices. 

If you live within 40 miles of 
the most populous cities, you 
should know that somewhere in 
that city is a very plain suitcase 
which is at once an answer to 
your prayers and to those strange 
nostalgic desires you’ve felt. It 
may be in a rented room or a 
storage warehouse, or in the attic 
of one of the many friends Ben- 
jamin Reeves has made. 

Wherever it is, you’re under 
its influence, thanks to Benja- 
min’s work. And every other day 
now, in a closed-off room at the 
Ben Reeves plant, technicians 
finish assembling another group 
of strange circuits which goes 
into another plain suitcase to be 
sent to yet another city, chosen 
on the basis of population vs. 
importance as a target. 

The technicians are learning 
speed. Be thankful for that, if 
you love your fellow-man as 
Benjamin does. At first they 
turned out only one machine a 
week; soon it will be one a day, 
then two, four. 

Benjamin doesn’t go out any 
more. He’s always within hearing 
of the receiver tuned to "the warn- 



ing networks, within reach of the 
red button that will someday 
send out a coded signal. 

D id you read about the situa- 
tion in this morning’s pa- 
pers? It looks like another crisis 
in the making and maybe this 
time neither side will back down. 

Pray for a year’s time, if you’re 
the praying kind. 

But whenever the missile^ 
come, Benjamin will press the 
red button at the first warning. 
The temporal field lasts only a 
millisecond and the missiles won’t 
he stopped, of course — but every 
city with a suitcase will be empty 
when they strike. 

If the crisis holds off for a 
year, Benjamin figures we’ll all 
go back together, each city and 
town to a different time, but all 
before 1900. It’s hard to wait 
even a year when you have the 
gene gnawing and nagging inside 
you ... 

Edgar Evans, who started it, 
couldn’t wait. Andover Hare re- 
fused to go back alone. Benjamin 
Reeves, with the same gene, was 
unable to forget what he told the 
military — run like hell! — and all 
the folks like us who couldn’t. 

So Benjamin found us the ul- 
timate way to run, and to satisfy 
our dream in the running. Not 
yet, but soon now. 

See you back there! ,

the 

Laxian 

Key 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



Free enterprise was fine, but 

AAA Ace happened on something 



even better — free production! 

Illustrated by EMSH 



R ichard Gregor was at 
his desk in the dusty 
office of the AAA Ace 
Interplanetary Decontamination 
Service. It was almost noon, but 
Arnold, his partner, hadn’t show- 
ed up yet. Gregor was just laying 
out an unusually complicated 
game of solitaire, when he heard 
a loud crash in the hall. 



The door of AAA Ace opened, 
and Arnold stuck his head in. 

“Banker’s hours?’’ Gregor ask- 
ed. 

“I have just made our for- 
tunes,’’ Arnold said. He threw the 
door fully open and beckoned 
dramatically. “Bring it in, boys.” 

Four sweating workmen lugged 
in a "'square black machine the

size of a baby elephant, and 
dropped it in the middle of the 
floor. 

“Therd it is,” Arnold said 
proudly. He paid the workmen, 
and stood, hands clasped behind 
his back, eyes half shut, survey- 
ing the machine. 

Gregor put his cards away with 
the slow, weary motions of a 
man who has seen everything. He 
stood up and walked around the 
machine. “All right, I give up. 
What is it?” 

“It’s a million bucks right in 
our fists,” Arnold said. 

“Of course. But what is it?” 

“It’s a Free Producer,” Ar- 
nold said. He smiled proudly. “I 
was walking past Joe’s Interstel- 
lar Junkyard this morning, and 
there it was, sitting in the win- 
dow. I picked it up for next to 
nothing. Joe didn’t even know 
what it was.” 

“I don’t, either,” Gregor said. 
“Do you?” 

Arnold was on his hands and 
knees trying to read the instruc- 
tions engraved on the front of 
the machine. Without looking up, 
he said, “You’ve heard of the 
planet Meldge, haven’t you?” 

Gregor nodded. 

M eldge was a third-rate 
little planet on the Northern 
periphery of the Galaxy, some 
distance from the trade routes. 
At one time, Meldge had pos- 



sessed an extremely advanced civ- 
ilization, made possible by the 
so-called Meldgen Old Science. 
The Old Science techniques had 
been lost ages ago, although an 
occasional artifact still turned up 
here and there. 

“And this is a product of the 
Old Science?” Gregor asked. 

“Right. It’s a Meldgen Free 
Producer. I doubt if there are 
more than four or five of them 
in the entire Universe. They can’t 
be duplicated.” 

“What does it produce?” Gre- 
gor asked. 

“How should I know?” Ar- 
nold said. “Hand me the Meldge- 
English dictionary, will you?” 
Keeping a stern rein on his pa- 
tience, Gregor walked to the 
bookshelf. “You don’t know what 
it produces — ” 

“Dictionary. Thank you. What 
does it matter what it produces? 
It’s free! This machine grabs 
energy out of the air, out of 
space, the Sun, anywhere. You 
don’t have to plug it in, fuel or 
service it. It runs indefinitely.” 
Arnold opened the dictionary 
and started to look up the words 
on the front of the Producer. 
“Free energy — ” 

“Those scientists were no 
fools,” Arnold said, jotting down 
his translation on a pocket pad. 
“The Producer just grabs energy 
out of the air. So it really does- 
n’t matter what it turns out. We 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



can always sell it, and anything 
we get will be pure profit.” 

Gregor stared at his dapper 
little partner, and his long, un- 
happy face became sadder than 
ever. 

“Arnold,” he said, “I’d like to 
remind you of something. First 
of all, you are a chemist. I am an 
ecologist. We know nothing about 
machinery, and less than nothing 
about complicated alien ma- 
chinery.” 

Arnold nodded absently and 
turned a dial. The Producer gave 
a dry gurgle. 

“What’s more,” Gregor said, 
retreating a few steps, “we are 
planetary decontaminationists. 
Remember? We have no reason 
to — ” 

The Producer began to cough 
unevenly. 

“Got it now,” Arnold said. “It 
says, ‘The Meldge Free Pro- 
ducer, another triumph of Glot- 
ten Laboratories. This' Producer 
is indestructible, unbreakable, 
free of all defects. No Power 
Hookup is required. To start, 
press Button One. To stop, use 
Laxian Key. Your Meldge Free 
Producer comes with an Eternal 
Guarantee against Breakdown. If 
defective in any way, please re- 
turn at once to Glotten Labora- 
tories.’ ” 

“Perhaps I didn’t make myself 
clear,” Gregor said. “We are 
planetary — ” 



“Don’t be stodgy,” Arnold 
said. “Once we get this thing 
working, we can retire. Here’s 
Button One.” 

The machine began to clank 
ominously, then shifted to a 
steady purr. For long minutes, 
nothing happened. 

“Needs warming up,” Arnold 
said anxiously. 

Then, out of an opening at the 
base of the machine, a gray 
powder bgan to pour. 

“Probably a waste product,” 
Gregor muttered. But the powder 
continued to stream over the floor 
for fifteen minutes. 

“Success!” Arnold shouted. 

“What is it?” Gregor asked. 

“I haven’t the faintest idea. 
I’ll have to run some tests.” Grin- 
ning triumphantly, Arnold scoop- 
ed some powder into a test tube 
and hurried over to his desk. 

Gregor stood in front of the 
Producer, watching the gray 
powder stream out. Finally he 
said, “Shouldn’t we turn it off 
until we find out what it is?” 

“Of course not,” Arnold said. 
“Whatever it is, it must be worth 
money.” He lighted his bunsen 
burner, filled a test tube with dis- 
tilled water, and went to work. 

• 

G regor shrugged his shoul- 
ers. He was used to his part- 
ner’s hair-brained schemes for 
quick wealth. Ever since they 
had formed AAA Ace, Arnold 



THE LAXIAN KEY 



61 



had been looking for short cuts. 
The short cuts usually resulted in 
more work than plain old- 
fashioned labor, but Arnold was 
quick to forget that. 

Well, Gregor thought, at least 
it kept things lively. He sat down 
at his desk and dealt out a com- 
plex solitaire pattern. 

T here was silence in the of- 
fice the next few hours. Arnold 
worked steadily, adding chemi- 
cals, pouring off precipitates, 
checking the results in several 
large books he kept on his desk. 

Gregor brought in sandwiches 
and coffee. After eating, he paced 
up and down, and watched the 
gray powder tumble steadily out 
of the machine. 

The purr of the Producer grew 
steadily louder, and the powder 
flowed in a thicker stream. 

An hour after lunch Arnold 
stood up. “We are in!” he stated. 

“What is that stuff?” Gregor 
asked, wondering if, for once, Ar- 
nold had hit upon something. 

“That stuff,” Arnold said, “is 
Tangreese.” He looked expectant- 
ly at Gregor. 

“Tangreese, eh?” 

“Absolutely.” 

“Then would you kindly tell 
me what Tangreese is?” Gregor 
shouted. 

“I thought you knew. Tan- 
greese is the basic food of the 
Meldgen people. I believe an 



adult Meldgen consumes several 
tons a year.” 

“Food, eh?” Gregor looked at 
the thick gray powder with new 
respect. A machine which turned 
out food steadily, twenty-four 
hours a day, might be a very 
good money maker. Especially if 
the machine never needed servic- 
ing and cost nothing to run. 

Arnold already had the tele- 
phone book open. “Here we are.” 
He dialed a number. “Hello, In- 
terstellar Food Corporation? Let 
me speak to the president. What? 
He isn’t? The vice-president then. 
This is important . Channels, 
eh? All right, here’s the story. I 
am in a position to supply you 
with an almost unlimited quan- 
tity of Tangreese, the basic food 
of the Meldgen people. That’s 
right. I knew you’d be interested. 
Yes, of course I’ll hold on.” 

He turned to Gregor, beaming. 
“These corporations think they 
can push — yes? Yes, sir, that’s 
right, sir. You do handle Tan- 
greese, eh? Fine, splendid!” 
Gregor moved closer, trying to 
hear what was being said on the 
other end. Arnold pushed him 
away. 

“Price? Well, what is the fair 
market price? Oh. Well, five dol- 
lars a ton isn’t much, but I sup- 
pose — what? Five cents a ton? 
You’re kidding!” 

Gregor walked away from the 
telephone and sank wearily into 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





a chair. Apathetically he listened 
to Arnold saying, “Yes, yes. Well, I 
didn’t know that. I see. Thanks.” 
Arnold hung up. “It seems,” he 
said, “there’s not much demand 
for Tangreese on Earth. There 
are only about fifty Meldgens 
here, and the cost of transporting 
it to the Northern periphery is 
prohibitively high.” 

Gregor raised both eyebrows 
and looked at the Producer. Ap- 
parently it had hit its stride, for 
Tangreese was pouring out like 
water from a high pressure hose. 
There was gray powder over 
everything in the room. It was 
half a foot high in front of the 
machine. 

“Never mind, we’ll sell It,” 
Arnold said. “It must be used for 
something else.” He returned to 
his desk and opened several more 
large books. 

“Shouldn’t we turn it off in the 
meantime?” Gregor asked. 

“Certainly not,” Arnold said. 
“It’s free, don’t you understand? 
It’s making money for us.” 

He plunged into his books. 
Gregor began to pace the floor, 
but found it difficult wading 
through the ankle-deep Tan- 
greese. He slumped into his chair, 
wondering why he hadn’t gone 
into landscape gardening. 

B y early evening, gray dust 
had filled the room to a depth 
of several feet. Several pens, pen- 



cils, a briefcase and a small filing 
cabinet were already lost in it, 
and Gregor was beginning to 
wonder if the floor would hold the 
weight. He had to shovel a path 
to the door, using a wastepaper 
basket as an improvised spade. 

Arnold finally closed his books 
with a look of weary satisfaction. 
“There is another use.” 

“What?” 

' “Tangreese is used as a build- 
ing material. After a few weeks’ 
exposure to the air it hardens like 
granite, you know.” 

“No, I didn’t.” 

“Get a construction company 
on the telephone. We’ll take care 
of this right now.” 

Gregor called the Toledo-Mars 
Construction Company and told 
a Mr. O’Toole that they were 
prepared to supply them with an 
almost unlimited quantity of 
Tangreese. 

“Tangreese, eh?” O’Toole said. 
“Not too popular as a building 
material these days. Doesn’t hold 
paint, you know.” 

“No, I didn’t,” Gregor admit- 
ted unhappily. 

“Fact. Tell you what. Tan- 
greese can be eaten by some crazy 
race. Why don’t you — ” 

“We prefer to sell it as a build- 
ing material,” Gregor said.- 
“Well, I suppose we can buy it. 
Always some cheap construction 
going on. Give you fifteen a ton 
for it.” 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Dollars?” 

“Cents.” 

“I’ll let you know,” Gregor 
said. 

His partner nodded sagely 
when he heard the offer. “That’s 
all right. Say this machine of ours 
produces ten tons a day, every 
day, year after year. Let’s see 
. .” He did some quick figuring 
with his slide rule. “That’s al- 
most five hundred and fifty dol- 
lars a year. Won’t make us rich, 
but it’ll help pay the rent.” 

“But we can’t leave it here,” 
Gregof said, looking with alarm 
at the ever-increasing pile of 
Tangreese. 

“Of course not. We’ll find a va- 
cant lot in the country and turn 
it loose. They can haul the stuff 
away any time they like.” 

Gregor called O’Toole and said 
they would be happy to do busi- 
ness. 

“All right,” O’Toole said. “You 
know where our plant is. Just 
truck the stuff in any old time.” 

“Us truck it in? I thought you 
would — ” 

“At fifteen cents a ton? No, 
we’re doing you a favor just tak- 
ing it off your hands. You truck 
it in.” 

“That’s bad,” Arnold said, af- 
ter Gregor had hung up. “The 
cost of transporting it — ” 

“Would be far more than fif- 
teen cents a ton,” Gregor said. 
“You’d better sliut tfiat thing off 



until we decide what to do.” 

Arnold waded up to the Pro- 
ducer. “Let me see,” he said. “To 
turn it off, I use the Laxian Key.” 
He studied the front of the ma- 
chine. 

“Go ahead, turn it off,” Gre- 
gor said. 

“Just a moment.” 

“Are you going to turn it off 
or not?” 

Arnold straightened up and 
gave an embarrassed little laugh. 
“It’s not that easy.” 

“Why not?” 

“We need a Laxian Key to 
turn it off. And we don’t seem to 
have one.” 

^^HE next few hours were spent 
in frantic telephone calls 
around the country. Gregor and 
Arnold contacted museums, re- 
search institutions, the archeo- 
logical departments of colleges, 
and anyone else they could think 
of. No one had ever seen a Laxian 
Key, or heard of one being found. 

In desperation, Arnold called 
Joe, the Interstellar Junkman, at 
his downtown penthouse. 

“No, I ain’t got no Laxian 
Key,” Joe said. “Why you think 
I sold you the gadget so cheap?” 

They put down the telephone 
and stared at each other. The 
Meldgen Free Producer was 
cheerfully blasting out its stream 
of worthless powder. Two chairs 
and a radiator had disappeared 



THE LAXIAN KEY

into it, and the gray Tangreese 
was approaching desk-top level. 

“Nice little wage earner,” Gre- 
gor said. 

“We’ll think of something.” 

“We?” 

Arnold returned to his books, 
and spent the rest of the night 
searching for another use for Tan- 
greese. Gregor had to shovel the 
gray powder into the hall, to 
keep their office from becoming 
completely submerged. 

The morning came, and the 
Sun gleamed gaily on their win- 
dows through a film of gray dust. 
Arnold stood up and yawned. 

“No luck?” Gregor asked. 

“I’m afraid not.” 

Gregor waded out for coffee. 
When he returned, the building 
superintendent and two large, 
red-faced policemen were shout- 
ing at Arnold. 

“You gotta get every bit of 
that sand outa my hall!” the 
super screamed. 

“Yeah, and there’s an ordi- 
nance against operating a factory 
in a business district,” one of the 
red-faced policemen said. 

“This isn’t a factory,” Gregor 
explained. “This is a Meldgen 
Free — ” 

“I say it’s a factory,” the po- 
liceman said. “And I say you 
gotta cease operation at once.” 

“That’s our problem,” Arnold 
said. “We can’t seem to turn it 
off.” 



“Can’t turn it Off?” The police- 
man glared at them suspiciously. 
“You trying to kid me? I say you 
gotta turn it off.” 

“Officer, I swear to you — ” 
“Listen, wise guy. I’ll be back 
in an hour. You get that thing 
turned off and this mess out of 
here, or I’m giving you a sum- 
mons.” The three men marched 
out. 

Gregor and Arnold looked at 
each other, then at the Free Pro- 
ducer. The Tangreese was at 
desk-top level now, and still com- 
ing steadily. 

“Damn it all,” Arnold said, 
with a touch of hysteria, “there 
must be a way of working it out. 
There must be a market! It’s 
free, I tell you. Every bit of 
this powder is free, free, free!” 
“Steady,” Gregor said, wearily 
scratching sand out of his hair. 

“Don’t you understand? When 
you get something free, in un- 
limited quantities, there has to 
be an application for it.” 




T he door opened and a tall, 
thin man in a dark business 
suit walked in, holding a com- 
plex little gadget in his hand. 
“So here it is,” the man said. 
Gregor was struck by a sud- 
den wild thought. “Is that a 
Laxian Key?” he asked. 

“A what key? No, I don’t sup- 
pose it is,” the man said. “It’s a 
drainometer.” 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Oh,” Gregor said. 

“And it seems to have brought 
me to the source of the trouble,” 
the man said. “By the way, I’m 
Mr. Carstairs.” He cleared sand 
from Gregor’s desk, took a last 
reading on his drainometer, and 
started to fill out a printed form. 

“What’s all this about?” Ar- 
nold asked. 

“I’m from the Metropolitan 
Power Company,” Carstairs said. 
“Starting around noon yesterday, 
we observed a sudden enormous 
drain on our facilities. So much 
power was being siphoned off that 
we felt it wise to search out just 
where it was coming from.” 

“And it’s coming from here?” 
Gregor asked. 

“From that machine of yours,” 
Carstairs said. He completed his 
form, folded it and put it in his 
pocket. “Thanks for your coop- 
eration. You will be billed for 
this, of course.” With some diffi- 
culty he opened the door, then 
turned and took another look at 
the Free Producer. 

“It must be making something 
extremely valuable,” he said, “to 
justify the expenditure of so 
much power. What is it? Plati- 
num dust?” 

He smiled, nodded pleasantly, 
and left. 

Gregor turned to Arnold. “Free 
power, eh?” 

“Well,” Arnold said, “I guess 
it just grabs it from the nearest 



power source.” 

“So I see. Draws power out of 
the air, out of space, out of the 
Sun. And out of the power com- 
pany’s lines, if they’re handy.” 

“So it seems. But the basic 
principle — ” 

“To hell with the basic prin- 
ciple!” Gregor shouted. “We * 
can’t turn this damned thing off 
without a Laxian Key, no one’s 
got a Laxian Key, we’re sub- 
merged ip worthless dust which 
we can’t even afford to truck out, 
and we’re probably burning up 
power like a sun gone nova!” 

“There must be a solution,” 
Arnold said sullenly. 

Gregor thought sadly of their 
diminishing bank account. They 
had made a small profit on their 
last two jobs, but it was being 
converted rapidly into gray sand. 
Still, there was nothing he could 
do about it. Arnold was his part- 
ner. They had gone this far, they 
might as well go the rest of the 
way. 

Arnold sat down where the 
desk had been and covered his 
eyes. There was a loud knock on. ■ 
the door, and angry voices out- 
side. 

“Lock the door,” Arnold said. 

Gregor locked it. Arnold 
thought for a few moments long- 
er, then stood up. 

“All is not lost,” he said. “Our 
fortunes will still be made from 
this machine.” 



THE LAXIAN KEY 



67 



“Let’s just destroy it,” Gre- 
gor said. “Drop it in an ocean or 
something.” 

“No! I’ve got it now! Come on, 
let’s get our spaceship warmed 
up.” 

T he next few days were hectic 
ones for AAA Ace. They had 
to hire men, at exorbitant rates, 
to clear the building of Tan- 
greese. Then came the problem 
of getting the machine, still spout- 
ing gray dust, into their space- 
ship. But at last everything was 
done. The Free Producer sat in 
the hold, rapidly filling it with 
Tangreese, and their ship was out 
of the System and moving fast 
on overdrive. 

“It’s only logical,” Arnold ex- 
plained later. “Naturally there’s 
no market for Tangreese on 
Earth. Therefore there’s no use 
trying to sell it on Earth. But on 
the planet Meldge — ” 

“I don’t like it,” Gregor said. 
“It can’t fail. It costs too much 
to transport Trangreese to 
Meldge. But we’re moving our 
entire factory there. We can pour 
out a constant stream of the 
stuff.” 

“Suppose the market is low?” 
Gregor asked. 

“How low can it get? This 
stuff is like bread to the Meld- 
gens. It’s their basic diet. How 
can we miss?” 

After two weeks in space, 



Meldge was sighted on their star- 
board bow. It came none too 
soon. Tangreese had completely 
filled the hold. They had sealed 
it off, but the increasing pressure 
threatened to burst the sides of 
the ship. They had to dump tons 
of it every day, but dumping took 
time, and there was a loss of heat 
and air in the process. 

So they spiraled into Meldge 
with every inch of their ship 
crammed with Tangreese, low on 
oxygen, and extremely cold. 

A S soon as they had landed, a 
large orange-skinned customs 
official came on board. 

“Welcome,” he said; “Seldom 
do visitors come to our unim- 
portant little planet. Do you ex- 
pect to stay long?” 

“Probably,” Arnold said. 
“We’re going to set up a busi- 
ness.” 

“Excellent!” the official said, 
smiling happily. “Our planet 
needs new blood, new enterprises. 
Might I enquire what business?” 
“We’re going to sell Tangreese, 
the basic food of — ” 

The official’s face darkened. 
“You’re going to sell what?” 
“Tangreese. We have a Free 
Producer.” 

The official pressed a button on 
a wrist dial. “I am sorry, you 
must leave at once.” 

“But we’ve got passports, 
clearance papers — ”

“And we have laws. You must 
blast off immediately, and take 
your Free Producer with you.” 
“Now look here,” Gregor said. 
“There’s supposed to be free en- 
terprise on this planet.” 

“Not in the production of 
Tangreese, there isn’t.” 

Outside, a dozen army tanks 
rumbled onto the landing field 
and ringed themselves around the 
ship. The official backed out the 
port and started down the lad- 
der. 

“Wait!” Gregor cried in des- 
peration. “I suppose you’re afraid 
of unfair competition. Well, take 
the Free Producer as our gift.” 
“No!” Arnold shouted. 

“Yes! Just dig it out and take 
it. Feed your poor with it. Just 
raise a statue to us sometime.” 

A second row of army tanks 
appeared. Overhead, antiquated 
jet planes dipped low over the 
field. 

“Get off this planet!” the of- 



ficial shouted. “Do you really 
think you can sell Tangreese on 
Meldge? Look around!’! 

They looked. The landing field 
was gray and powdery, and the 
buildings were the same unpaint- 
ed gray. Beyond them stretched 
dull gray fields to a range of low 
gray mountains. 

On all sides, as far as they 
could see, everything was Tan- 
greese -gray. 

“Do you mean,” Gregor asked, 
“that the whole planet — ” 

“Figure it out for yourself,” 
the official said, backing down 
the ladder. “The Old Science orig- 
inated here, and there are always 
fools who have to tamper with its 
artifacts. Now get going, and 
quickly.” 

Halfway down the ladder he 
hesitated. “However,” he said, 
“if you ever find a Laxian Key, 
come back. We’ll erect ten statues 
to you!”

Cause; the 1954 International Fantasy Award, highest honor in science fiction, was given 
to (1) More Than Human by Theodore Sturgeon, which appeared in GALAXY as "Baby Is 
Three;" (2) The Demolished Man by Alfred Bester, serialized here under the same title; 
(3) The Space Merchants by Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth, serialized here as "Gravy

ASTEROID ROUNDUP 

T his year marks the 60th 
anniversary of an impor- 
tant astronomical discovery 
which, however, did not then take 
place. Now this might sound con- 
fusing, so let me rephrase it by 
saying that 60 years have gone 
by since an important astronomi- 
cal discovery could have been 
made. If that is still not quite 
clear, it has to be said more 
bluntly by stating that Harvard 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



College Observatory missed 
something important 60 years 
ago. Two years later, the astron- 
omers at Arequipa, Peru, missed 
the same chance of amassing 
some fame. They both photo- 
graphed Planetoid No. 433 and 
did not realize what it was that 
showed on their plates. 

Of course, it is conceivable 
that they may have been some- 
what tired of planetoids (or as- 
teroids) by that time. The first 
one of that swarm of diminutive 
planets betweferi the orbits of 
Mars and Jupiter had shown up 
during the night preceding 
January 1, 1801. Professor Giu- 
seppe Piazzi, trying to correct 
a typographical error in a re- 
cently published catalogue of 
fixed stars, had noticed a faint 
star where there should be none 
at all. Further observation and 
a calculation of the orbit by Karl 
Friedrich Gauss established that 
it was not a comet, as suspected 
at first, but a small planet. 

It was named Ceres and we 
now know that it is the largest 
mernber of the Asteroid Belt, 
with a diameter of 480 miles. 

I N the late evening hours of 
March 18, 1802, an amateur 
astronomer, Wilhelm Matthaus 
Gibers, M.D. of Bremen, found a 
second such planet while on the 
lookout for comets. It was called 
Pallas and turned out to be»the 



second largest, with a diameter of 
just a trifle over 300 miles. The 
same Dr. Gibers discovered one 
more, Vesta, in 1807, but Vesta 
was already No. 4, for Harding 
had found No. 3, Juno, in 1804. 

I haven’t been able to discover 
yet just why Dr. Gibers — indu- 
bitably the expert in this field, 
with two discoveries out of a 
total of four — ^believed and con- 
vinced others that there were 
only four planetoids. Almost a 
score of years passed until some- 
body decided to see whether 
there mightn’t be more. 

This skeptical character was, 
like Dr. Gibers, an amateur, one 
Mr. M. Hencke of Driesen in 
Germany. After fifteen years of 
search, he was able to announce 
the discovery of No. S, Astraea, 
thirty-eight years after the dis- 
covery of No. 4, Vesta. Two years 
later, Mr. Hencke informed the 
world that he had found No. 6, 
Hebe. 

Then others went to work. 
When the 50th anniversary of the 
discovery of Ceres came around. 
No. 14, named Irene, had just 
been identified. 

So far, the joy of discovery had 
not been tarnished, but then it be- 
gan to be dimmed by sheer num- 
bers. In 1870, the number of 
known and named planetoids had 
grown to 110. In 1890, it had in- 
creased to 300. 

It was then that a Dr. Isaac

Berlin, which led to discovery of Eros. 



Roberts made a fateful sugges- 
tion. One could keep track of 
these little bodies best by means 
of the photographic plate, he 
said. Astronomers previously had 
checked the actual appearance of 
the sky, along the band where the 
planetoids had to be, against star 
maps. Anything that showed in 
the telescope but could not be 
found on the chart had to be 
either a comet or a planetoid. It 
would be simpler. Dr. Roberts 
said, to photograph these areas, 
following the apparent movement 
of the fixed stars with the instru- 
ment. The stars would then show 
up as points, while things that 
moved — comets and planetoids — 



would show as short lines. 

Professor Max Wolf of Heidel- 
berg was the first to adopt this 
suggestion. The results were 
simply disastrous. Yes, you 
could check on known planetoids 
in that manner — but you could 
not avoid discovering dozens of 
new ones at the same time. 

W ITHIN the four years from 
1891 to 1895, no less than 
107 new asteroids were discover- 
ed! At the turn of the century, 
the total number was 559, of 
which 452 had been numbered 
and named! Professor Wolf and 
his assistants had added more 
than a hundred to the 300 known 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in 1890, Prof. Charlois of Nice 
had added around 95, and Prof. 
Palisa of Vienna 83! C. H. F. 
Peters had found 52 or 53 and 
many others could boast half a 
dozen. 

Naturally, there were countless 
duplications. The job of identify- 
ing the short lines on countless 
plates alone assumed almost su- 
perhuman proportions. 

A rather fast-growing group of 
astronomers decided that all this 
was more or less wasted effort 
and skipped reports on Kleine 
Planeten when reading their pro- 
fessional journals. Others decided 
that it was more important to 
keep track of the lower-number- 
ed and larger planetoids and let 
others worry about identification 
and establishment of their new 
discoveries. (A few resolutely de- 
cided to study the Sun instead.) 
And in this general atmosphere 
of “too much news,” there came 
the evening of August 13, 1898. 

The place was the Urania Ob- 
servatory in Berlin. It had been 
planned to be “quite some dis- 
tance” from the city so that the 
work of the astronomers should 
not be hampered by city lights. 
But by 1898, the city was alr>eady 
encroaching on it. By the time 
of the First World War, when I 
was old enough to pay attention 
to such things, the Urania Obser- 
vatory was deep inside the city 
and was used for instruction and 



popular lectures only. 

In 1898, the Urania Observa- 
tory boasted the biggest telescope 
— a 12-incher — in all Prussia and 
the chief astronomer. Dr. G. Witt, 
had installed some photographic 
equipment. He must have been 
short of funds, for the little box 
that housed the small electric 
lamp illuminating the spider-web 
crosshairs had been made by the 
scientific staff out of a cigar box. 

A more serious worry of Dr. 
Witt was that he did not trust 
the clockwork mechanism that 
guided the telescope. This can 
be corrected manually if some- 
body sees to it that a fixed star, 
picked for the purpose, does not 
leave its assigned place in the 
field of an auxiliary instrument. 
This job was done by a young 
student by the name of Felix 
Linke. 

Linke told me later that there 
happened to be a heat wave at 
the time and that they were 
happy if there was a reason to 
go to the darkroom, which was 
the coolest place in the whole 
observatory, but that the word 
“cool” applied only by compari- 
son with the rest. 

T he program deci’ded upon by 
Dr. Witt for the night of Aug- 
ust 13 to 14 was to track down 
No. 185, Eunike. Eunike had not 
been seen for years. But if the 
old orbit calculation still held

helion. 



true, Eunike should be in the 
general vicinity of the fixed star 
beta of the constellation Aquarius. 

The photographic instrument 
was pointed in the proper di- 
rection and Linke held it as 
steady as he could for two hours. 
Then Dr. Witt and his helper 
rushed the new plate to the “cool” 
darkroom and, after it had been 
racked up to dry, they went home 
to get as much sleep as the heat 
would permit. Next day, they 
went over the plate with a mag- 



nifying glass, looking for plane- 
toid tracks. 

Eunike was where she was sup- 
posed to be, or very nearly so. 
Another known planetoid had 
also left its visiting card. But 
near the star beta Aquarii, there 
was another track of unusual 
length, measuring 0.4 millimeters 
on the original plate. Dr. Witt 
thought at first that this was no 
track at all, but a flaw in the 
plate. Then he decided that it was 
a genuine track and, because of 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



its unusual length, it had to be 
made by a fast-moving body. It 
could still be a comet, however. 

In the evening, the 12-incher 
went into action for direct obser- 
vation. The tiny “star” that had 
made the track the night before 
could be clearly seen. It was not 
a comet. Hence it had to be an- 
I other new planetoid. 

The customary wires to other 
observatories were sent and quite 
a lot of observations accumulated 
during the next six days. Then 
Dr. Berberich, the chief of the 
Computi n g Institute, which had 
been founded especially for keep- 
ing track of the minor planets, 
retired with all the observations 
of Object 1898 DQ and began to 
compute its orbit. 

It turned ©ut to be the most 
unusual orbit of any planetoid 
thus far. Most of it was between 
the orbits and Earth and Mars. 
And its mean distance from the 
Sun was smaller than that of any 
other. 

It was for these reasons that 
Dr. Witt insisted that 1898 DQ, 
or planetoid No. 433, should be 
given a name which, by itself, 
emphasized that it was a special 
case. Starting with Ceres, Pallas, 
Juno and Vesta, all planetoids 
had been given female names, 
preferably classical. The new one 
was to receive a male name. 

Dr. Witt selected Eros. 

The orbit computed by Dr. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



Berberich showed that the point 
closest to the Sun, the perihelion, 
is only 1.13 astronomicaf ^linits 
from the Sun. The point of 
Earth’s orbit closest to the peri- 
helion of Eros is passed by Earth 
every January 22nd. If it hap- 
pened that Eros passed its peri- 
helion on that date, or close to 
it, the distance Earth-to-Eros 
would be a mere 14 million miles. 

This was considerably closer 
than anything else known at that 
time (not counting the Moon) 
because the closest Venus can 
come is 20 million miles 4nd the 
closest approach of Mars about 
35 million miles. - 

A T the time of the actual dis- 
covery by Dr. Witt, Eros 
'had been near its aphelion and 
the question was — how long one 
would have to wait to get a close 
look? 

Eros needed 643 days to go 
from perihelion to perihelion. It 
followed that Eros and Earth 
would be in the same direction, as 
seen from the Sun, approximately 
every two years and four months. 

But, as a look at the diagram 
shows, this still implies greatly 
varying distances. When had Eros 
been at its perihelion, on or about 
January 22nd, an;^year? The an- 
swer was disappointing: it had 
been in January 1894, four and a 
half years before it was discov- 
ered. 



75 



When that date was establish- 
ed, a search of old plates was 
made and it turned out that Har- 
vard College Observatory had 
Eros on seventeen plates exposed 
at that time. And Arequipa had 
photographed it four times in 
1896. 

The next really close approach 
of Eros, was not due until 1931. 
Then there was to be one almost 
as good in 1938, but for another 
one as good as the missed one in 
1894, one must wait until Eros 
has completed 46 of its revolu- 
tions. This means 81 years, so 
that Eros will be a minimum dis- 
tance again in 1975. 

But in the meantime, astron- 
omers have put Eros to good use 
even with somewhat inferior op- 
positions. The elementary and 
fundamental yardstick in astron- 
omy is the “astronomical unit” — 
the distance of Earth from the 
Sun. By observing Eros, the 
value of this yardstick has been 
considerably refined. And as Eros 
comes inward in the Solar Sys- 
tem, it is, of course, being acted 
on by the gravitational fields of 
all the inner planets. This fact 
can be utilized to determine the 
masses of the inner planets. 

In the case of Venus, for ex- 
ample, the mass had to be de- 
rived in part from the influence 
of Venus on Mars. It was, to 
quote Dr. Paul Herget, one of 
the paradoxes of astronomy 



where “we photograph Mars to 
see how much Venus weighs.” 
Photographing Eros for the same 
purpose gives better figures. Drs. 
Eugene Rabe and Gustav Stracke 
engaged in an elaborate and 
tedious investigation of the be- 
havior of Eros to establish the 
masses of the two planets inside 
the orbit of Earth. 

A t this point, somebody is 
likely to ask about the mass 
of Eros itself. Well, that’s not 
so simple. The best we can say 
is that Eros, if dumped on Earth 
without shattering, would merely 
become our highest mountain. 

Eros rotates around its axis 
and, while doing so, its bright- 
ness changes. This leads to the 
suspicion that it is not spherical, 
but of irregular shape. 

In 1937, several astronomers 
published their observations and 
the conclusion they drew was that 
Eros might have a shape like a 
poorly formed brick. Assuming a 
density of 1.63 times that of 
water, they calculated that the 
longest axis of this “brick” was 
21.5 miles and that the two short- 
er axes measured 13.0 and 10.1 
miles. The shortest axis is the 
axis of rotation and the period of 
rotation was given as five hours 
and 16 minutes. 

All this is still subject to cor- 
rection and the figures may 
change somewhat, but it can be 



taken for granted that Eros has 
an irregular shape that would be 
impossible for a body of much 
larger size. It is very simply, a 
huge mountain circling the Sun. 

I may add here tl?at its co- 
discoverer, Linke, has offered the 
suggestion that Eros may not be 
a single body, but several small 
ones rotating around their com- 
mon center of gravity. It’s pos- 
sible, but not established. 

At any event, planetoid No. 
433 constitutes one of the strang- 
est and most intriguing astronom- 
ical discoveries ever made. 

THE S^^ALLEST "BOMB" 

■VTO weapon, it seems, ever be-

manently obsolete. 

Muzzle-loading cannon, for in^ 
stance, had almost become pro- 
verbial as something thoroughly 
out of date, useless and very 
nearly laughable — but then some- 
body invented the trench mortar 
and a whole family of muzzle- 
loading “trench artillery” sprang 
up during the First World War. 

The war rocket was “obsolete” 
for nearly a century, too — so 
much so, in fact, that most peo- 
ple didn’t even know there had 
been war rockets once. But then, 
as you well remember, designers 
replaced the old and hazardous 
blackpowder propelling charge 
with a reliable stick of smoke-

less power — and the war rocket 
was back in many different ver- 
sions and in great quantities. 

The age of the airplane and the 
blimp looked back on ^he free 
balloon as something of the past 
— especially the free balloon 
made of paper, like the earliest 
attempts of the brothers Mont- 
golfier — but then the Japanese 
recalled the existence of a fast 
air current moving east over the 
Pacific Ocean and long-range 
bombing balloons were made, 
many of them of paper! 

As a historic oddity, I might 
add that even the old fire-arrow 
staged a small comeback in the 
Second World War. During the 
fight for the Italian colonies in 
East Africa, the Italians quarter- 
ed their troops in native-built 
grass huts. Other African natives, 
under British command, sneaked 
through the underbrush with 
bows and fire-arrows and

promptly shot them aflame! 

All of which is an introduction 
to the latest weapon of the U. S. 
Air Force, the “Lazy Dog.” It is 
just a small piece of steel, weigh- 
ing less than an ounce, and not 
much over an inch in length. 
Being finned like a miniature 
bomb, the Lazy Dog, shoveled 
overboard from an airplane, will 
point its nose down and pierce a 
target like a rifle bulj.et fired ver- 
tically downward. Being solid 
metal, it won’t explode, but it will 
make holes in tires, gasoline 
drums and people. Its impact 
velocity will probably be high 
enough to go through the top of 

A novel idea? Well, no. The 
French invented it forty years 
ago, when airplanes were as wob- 
bly as they looked an"d could 
carry some 15 or 20 lbs. of psy- 
load in addition to the pilot, 
whose ideal personal build was 
that of a jockey.

now, still lacked aerodynamical 
refinement and had a shape that 
justified its name of “airplane 
arrow.” It was eight millimeters 
(5/16 of an inch) in diameter and 
weighed 3^4 of an ounce. 

The French must have prepar- 
ed this weapon some time in 
advance of the First World War, 
because they used it in their 
earliest attacks against German 
ground troops.

any questions? 

Today I came across a state- 
ment in an article by Arthur C. 
Clarke which I do not quite un- 
derstand. He says in speaking of 
weight and inertia that it would 
be “six times easier to pick up a 
sledgehammer on the Moon, but 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



just as hard to swing it.” Would 
you explain this, please? 

Jean De Grazia 
597 Hopkins St. 
Sewickley, Penna. 

This example is intended to 
illustrate that we, existing un- 
der the constant and unvarying 
pull of Earth’s gravity, have 
come to forget that there is a 
difference between weight and 
inertia. To us, a certain weight 
seems to go with a certain 
amount of inertia, but actually 
the two are not the same, which 
we would realize quickly if we 
were subjected to a gravita- 
tional field of a different 
strength. 

Let’s try to approach the 
problem from another angle. 
Six pounds of steak have, as 
anyone knows, a certain 
amount of food value. They 
will provide, say, a meal for 
six hungry people. On the 
Moon, the same amount of 
steak would weigh only one 
pound — but it would still be 
a meal for six. It is easy to 
realize, from this example, that 
we have fallen into the habit of 
associating a certain number of 
calories with a certain weight. 

Now consider the problem of 
the sledgehammer. If you pick 
it up on Earth, you work against 
Earth’s gravity and you have 
to lift, say, twelve pounds. If 
you lift the same sledgehammer 



on the Moon, against the lesser 
lunar gravity, you have to lift 
what to early muscles feels like 
two pounds. But il( you swing 
it, on Earth or on the Moon, 
you have to accelerate its mass. 
That would be the same in 
either case, since accelerating 
the same mass needs the same 
' force regardless of the gravity 
present. 

Are there any other materials 
besides lead and concrete that are 
used for radiation shielding? If 
so, what radiations (meaning al- 
pha, beta or gamma rays and 
neutrons') do they stop? 

James Reeve 
7005 — Sth Avenue’ 

Los Angeles 43, Calif. 

The materials most used in 
atomic laboratories and power 
plants are, as you say, concrete 
and lead. Concrete shielding is 
customary for permanent in- 
stallations, while lead, in the 
form of bricks, is used for tem- 
porary setups. 

Actually, any kind of mat- 
ter could be used for shielding 
against any kind of radiations. 
It is merely a question of vol- 
ume. Slabs of slate may not be 
a good shield, hut a mountain 
of slate is. A fishtank full of 
water is poor protection, but a 
large lake is a different story. 

The reasons for using con- 
crete or lead are, therefore. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



79 



purely practical reasons. Con- 
crete is needed in large qnan- 
tities, but it is both cheap and 
available. I^ead is used because 
of its high density, so that the 
volume (though not the 
weight) of matter to be moved 
around is comparatively small. 

Would you please advise me’ 
about the following concept: As- 
sume that the Earth is the only 
body in space. I contend that it 
would then be impossible for any 
rocket to escape from the Earth. 
Inasmuch as the gravitational 
field of the Earth extends to in- 
finity and the speed of the rocket 
must be finite, it would always 
fall back sooner or later because 
the pull of the Earth will con- 
tinually subtract velocity from 
the rocket. Right or wrong? 

David Richardson 
1803 Rhodes St. 
Madison, Illinois 
Wrong. But this is one of the 
so-called “instructive errors” 
that deserve fliscussion and 
clarification. 

To begin with, the assump- 
tion that the Earth is the only 
body in space is not necessary. 
Even as things are, the gravi- 
tational field of the Earth ex- 
tends theoretically to infinity. 
But it grows weaker all the time 
with distance and the require- 
ment is simply that the kinetic 
energy of the moving (and no 



longer burning) rocket is 
greater than the force of the 
gravitational field at any point 
along its trajectory. 

To explain this statement, 
let’s look at the motion of a 
body falling toward Earth from 
infinity. At a distance of 100,- 
000 miles from the surface, this 
body will have a certain veloc- 
ity. At the distance of 10,000 
miles, it will have a certain and 
obviously higher velocity. At 
the distance of 1,000 miles, it 
will have a still higher velocity. 
And it will have the highest 
velocity it can ever have at the 
moment of impact. 

If a rocket going the other 
way is to reach infinity, it must 
have a velocity that is somewhat 
(only very slightly) higher 
than the corresponding veloc- 
ities of the falling body. The 
impact velocity would be just 
a shade below seven miles per 
second. 

Hence if tbe rocket near the 
surface of the Earth reached 
seven miles per second, it 
would go to infinity, for it 
would, at all points along the 
trajectory, have a velocity 
slightly higher than that of the 
falling body. 

Earth’s gravitational pull 
would eventually slow it down 
— after a sufficiently long time,

three inches per century ! But

Earth’s gravitational pull could 
never bring it to a standstill. 

For this reason, this velocity 
of seven miles per second has 
been named “escaped velocity” 
by rocket men. Astronomers 
still use the older but equivalent 
term of “parabolic velocity.” 

Might not differences in elec- 
tric potential be one of the haz- 
ards of space travel? A body 
leaving Earth at zero potential 
{relative to the Earth) might find 
that other planetary bodies have 
electric potentials higher or lower 
than Terra.

This question has come up 
in space travel discussions for 
some time, but unfortunately 
there is no satisfactory answer. 
The main question is, of course, 
whether the electric potential of 
another planet — for example. 
Mars — is actually different 
from that of Earth. We don’t 
know and physicists have no 
way at present^ short of an ac- 
tual visit, to decide this ques- 
tion. The attitude of engineers 
is somewhat more positive. 
They feel that if such differ- 
ences exist, they’ll do some- 



thing about it. 

Dr. Wernher von Braun stat- 
ed flatly: “This cannot be con- 
sidered a hazard to space travel 
at all. The capacity of a space 
vehicle entering the atmosphere 
of another planet is extremely 
small and the number of coul- 
ombs which must travel into 
the ship or out of it to make its 
electric potential equal to that 
of the surrounding environ- 
ment is very small. Any brush 
discharger can easily take care 
of this.” 

A slightly different situation 
would exist if the target planet 
happens to be without (or vir- 
tually without) an atmosphere, 
as, for instance, the Moon. At 
first glance, it might seem as if 
the ship, with its possibly dif- 
ferent potential, would make 
contact suddenly. But on an kir- 
less planet, the ship would have 
to land with rocket motors 
working, balancing down on an 
exhaust blast. Since this blast 
consists of partly ionized gases, 
it would automatically perform 
the job of a “grounding” cable. 

To sum up; We don’t know 
whether this “hazard” actually 
exists, but we have every rea- 
son to believe that, if it does, 
it won’t be a hazard at all.

The Music Master o 

By EDGAR PANGBORN 

Illustrated by KRIGSTEIN 



What more fitting place for the last man On 
Earth to live in than a museum? Now if only 
he could avoid becoming an exhibit himselfl 



F or twenty-five years, no 
one came. In the seventy- 
sixth year of his life, Brian 
Van Anda was still trying not to 
remember a happy boyhood. To 
do so was irrelevant and danger- 
ous, although every instinct of his 
old age tempted him to reject 
the present and dwell in the lost 
times. 

He would recall stubbornly 



that the present year, for ex- 
ample, was 2096; that he had 
been born in 2020, seven years 
after the close of the Civil War, 
fifty years before the Final War, 
twenty-five years before the de- 
parture of the First Interstellar. 
(It had never returned, nor had 
the Second Interstellar. They 
might be still wandering, trifles of 
Man-made stardust.) He would 
recall his place of birth. New 
Boston, the fine, planned city far 
inland from the ancient metrop- 
olis that the rising sea had re- 
claimed after the earthquake of 
1994. 

Such things, places and dates, 
were factual props, useful when 
Brian wanted to impose an ex- 
ternal order on the vagueness of 
his immediate existence. He tried 
to make sure they became no 
more than that— to shut away the 
colors, the poignant sounds, the 
parks and the playgrounds of 
New Boston, the known faces 
(many of them loved), and the 
later years when he had briefly 
known a curious intoxication 
called fame. 

It was not necessarily better or 
wiser to reject those memories, 
but it was safer, and nowadays 
Brian was often sufficiently tired, 
sufficiently conscious of his grow- 
ing weakness and lonely unim- 
portance, to crave safety as a 
meadow mouse often craves a 
burrow. 



H e tied his canoe to the mas- 
sive window that for many 
years had been a port and a 
doorway. Lounging there with a 
suspended sense of time, he was 
hardly aware that he was listen- 
ing. In a way, all the twenty-five 
years had been a listening. He 
watched Earth’s patient star sink 
toward the rim of the forest on 
the Palisades. At this hour, it 
was sometimes possible, if the 
Sun-crimsoned water lay still, to 
cease grieving too much at the 
greater stillness. 

There was scattered human 
life elsewhere, he knew — probab- 
ly a great deal of it. After twenty- 
five years alone, that, too, often 
seemed almost irrelevant. At 
other times than mild evenings, 
hushed noons or mornings empty 
of human commotion, Brian 
might lapse into anger, fight the 
calm by yelling, resent the swift 
dying of his echoes. Such moods 
were brief. A kind of humor re- 
mained in him, not to be ruined 
by sorrow. 

He remembered how, ten 
months or possibly ten years 
ago, he had encountered a box 
turtle in a forest clearing, and 
had shouted at it: “They went 
thataway!’’ The turtle’s rigidly 
comic face, fixed by nature in a 
caricature of startled disapproval, 
had seemed to point up some 
truth or other. Brian had hunker- 
ed down on the moss and laughed 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



uproariously — ^until he observed 
that some of the laughter was 
weeping. 

Today had been rather good. 
He had killed a deer on the Pali- 
sades, and with bow and arrow, 
thus saving a bullet. Not that 
he needed to practice such econ- 
omy. He might live, he supposed, 
another decade or so at the most. 
His rifles were in good condition 
and his hoarded ammunition 
would easily outlast him. So 
would the stock of canned and 
dried food stuffed away in his 
living quarters. But there was 
satisfaction in primitive effort 
and no compulsion to analyze 
the why of it. 

The stored food was more im- 
portant than the ammunition. A 
time would come soon enough 
when he no longer had strength 
for hunting. He would lose the 
inclination for trips to cross the 
river. He would yield to such 
laziness or timidity for days, then 
weeks. Some time, when it be- 
came months or years, he might 
find himself too feeble to risk 
climbing the cliff wall into the 
forest. He would have the good 
sense then, he hoped, to destroy ^ 
the canoe, thus making of his 
weakness a necessity. 

Yl^HERE were books. There was 

the Hall of Music on the next 
floor above the water, probably 
safe from its lessening encroach- 



ment. To secure fresh water, he 
need only keep track of the tides, 
for the Hudson had cleaned itself 
and now rolled down sweet from 
the lonely, uncorrupted hills. His 
decline could be comfortable. He 
had provided for it and planned 
it. Yet gazing now across the 
sleepy water, seeing a broad- 
winged hawk circle in freedom 
above the forest, Brian*was aware 
of the old thought moving in 
him: 

“If I could hear voices — ^just 
once, if I could hear human 
voices ...” 

The Museum of Human His- 
tory, with the Hall of Music on 
what Brian thought of as the 
second floor, should also outlast 
his requirements. In the flooded 
lower floor and basement, the 
work of slow destruction must be 
going on. Here and there, the un- 
hurried waters could find their 
way to steel and make rust of it, 
for the waterproofing of the con- 
crete was nearly a hundred years 
old. But it ought to be good for 
another century or two. 

Nowadays the ocean was mild. 
There were moderate tides, winds 
no longer destructive. For the 
last six years, there had been no 
more of the heavy storms out of 
the south. In the same period, 
Brian had noted a rise in the 
water level of a mere nine inches. 
The window-sill, his port, was six 
inches above high-tide mark now. 



THE MUSIC MASTER 



85 



Perhaps Earth was settling into 
a new, amiable mood. The cli- 
mate had become delightful, 
about like what Brian remember- 
ed from a visit to southern Vir- 
ginia in his childhood. 

The last earthquake had, come 
in 2082 — a large one, Brian gues- 
sed, but its center could not have 
been close to the rock of Man- 
hattan. The Museum had only 
shivered and shrugged; it had 
survived much worse than that, 
half- a dozen times since 1994. 
After the tremor, a tall wave had 
thundered in from the south. Its 
force, like that of others, had 
mostly been dissipated against 
the barrier of tumbled rock and 
steel at the southern end of the 
submerged island — an undersea 
dam, Man-made though not 
Man-intended — and when it 
reached the Museum, it did no 
more than smash the southern 
windows ' in the Hall of Music, 
which earlier waves had not been 
able to reach. Then it passed on 
up the river, enfeebled. The win- 
dows of the lower, floor had all 
beeh broken long before that. 

A fter the earthquake of ’82, 
Brian had spent a month 
boarding up all the openings on 
the south side of the Hall of 
Music — after all, it was home — 
with lumber painfully ferried 
from mainland ruins. That year, 
he had been sixty-two years old 



and not moving with the ease of 
youth: a rough job. He had de- 
liberately left cracks and knot- 
holes. Sunlight sifted throiigffx 
in narrow beams, like the bars of 
dusty gold Brian could remember 
in a hayloft at his uncle’s farm in 
Vermont. It was quite pleasant. 

The Museum had been built 
in 2003. Manhattan, strangely 
enough, had never been bombed, 
although, in the Civil War, two 
of the type called “small fission’’ 
had fallen on the Brooklyn and 
Jersey sides — so Brian recalled 
from the jolly history books that 
had informed his adolescence that 
war was definitely a thing of 
the past. 

By the time of the final War, in 
2070, the sea, gorged on the melt- 
ing ice caps, had removed Man- 
hattan Island from history. 

’ Everything left standing above 
the waters south of the Museum 
had been knocked flat by the tor- 
nados of 2057 and 2064. A few 
, blobs of rock still marked where 
Central Park and Mount Morris 
Park had been, but they were 
not significant. Where Long Is- 
land once rose, there was a 
troubled area of shoals and tiny 
islands, probably a useful bar- 
rier of protection for the reced- 
ing shore of Connecticut. 

Men had yielded the great city 
inch by inch, then foot Ijy foot; 
a full mile in 2047, saying; “The 
flood years have passed their 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



peak and a return to normal is 
expected.” 

Brian sometimes felt a twinge 
of sympathy for the Neanderthal 
experts who must have told each 
other to expect a return to nor- 
mal after the Cro-Magnons stop- 
ped drifting in. 

In 2057, the island of Man- 
hattan had to be yielded alto- 
gether. New York City, half-new, 
half-ancient, sprawled stubborn 
and enormous upstream, on both 
sides of a river not done with 
its anger. But the Museum stood. 
■ Aided by sunken rubble of others 
of its kind, aided also by men 
because they still had time to 
love it, the Museum stood, and 
might for a long time yet — 
weather permitting. 

It covered an acre of ground 
well north of 125th Street, rising 
a modest fifteen stories, its foun- 
dation secure in that layer of 
rock which mimics eternity. It 
deserved its name: here men had 
brought samples of everything, 
literally everything known in the 
course of humanity since pre- 
history. It was, within human 
limits, definitive. In its way, con- 
sidering how much the„ erosion 
of time must always steal from 
scholars, it was perfect. 

N O one had felt anything un- 
natural in the refusal of the 
Directors of the Museum to move 
the collection after the Museum 



weathered the storm of 2057. In- 
stead, ordinary people, more than 
a thousand of them, donated 
money so that a mighty abutment 
could be built around the ground 
floor, a new entrance designed on 
the north side of the second. The 
abutment survived the greater 
tornado of 2064 without damage, 
although, during those seven 
years, the sea had risen another 
eight feet in its old ever-new 
game of making monkeys out of 
the wise. 

It was left for Brian Van Anda 
alone, in 2079, to see the waters 
slide quietly over the abutment, 
opening the lower regions for the, 
use of fishes and the more secret 
water-dwellers who like shelter 
and privacy. In the ’90s, Brian 
suspected the presence of an 
octopus or two in the vast vague 
territory which had once been 
parking lot, heating plant, stor- 
age space, air-raid shelter, etc. 
He couldn’t prove it; it just seem- 
ed like a comfortable place for 
an octopus. 

In 2070, plans were under con- 
sideration for building a new 
causeway to the Museum from 
the still expanding city in the 
north. In 2070, also, the final War 
began and ended. 

When Brian Van Anda came 
down the river late in 2071, a 
refugee from certain unfamiliar 
types of savagery, the Museum 
was empty of the living. He had 



THE MUSIC MASTER 



87 



spent many days in exhaustive 
'eitplQration of the building. He 
did that systematically, toiling at 
last up to the Directors’ meeting 
room on the top floor. There he 
observed how they must have 
been holding a conference at the 
very time when a new gas was 
tried out over New York in the 
north, in a final effort to per- 
suade the Western Federation 
that Man is the servant of the 
state and that the end justifies 
the means. 

Too bad, Brian sometimes 
thought, that he would never 
know exactly what happened to 
the Asian Empire. In the little 
paratroop-invaded area called 
the Soviet of North America, 
from which Brian had fled in ’71, 
the official doctrine was that the 
Asian Empire had won the war 
and that the saviors of humanity 
would be flying in any day to 
take over. Brian had doubted this 
out loud, and then stolen a boat 
and got away safely at night. 

Up in the meeting room, Brian 
had seen how that new neuro- 
toxin had been no respecter of 
persons. An easy death, though — 
no pain. He observed also how 
some things survive. The Mu- 
seum, for instance, was virtual- 
ly unharmed. 

B rian had often recalled 
those months in the meeting 
room as a sort of island in time. 



like the first hour of discovering 
that he could play Beethoven; or 
like the curiously cherished, more 
than life-size half-hour back there 
in Newburg, in 2071, when he had 
briefly met and spoken with an 
incredibly old man, Abraham 
Brown, President of the Western 
Federation at the time of the 
Civil War. Brown, with a loved 
world in almost total ruin around 
him, had spoken pleasantly of 
small things — of chrysanthemums 
that would soon be blooming in 
the front yard of the house where 
he lived with friends, of a piano 
recital by Van Anda at Ithaca, 
in 2067, which the old man re- 
membered with warm enthusi- 
asm. 

Yes, the Museum Directors 
had died easily, and now the 
old innocent bodies would be 
quite decent. There were no ver- 
min in the Museurri. The door-, 
ways and floors were tight, the 
upper windows unbroken. 

One of the white-haired men 
had a Ming vase on his desk. 
He had not dropped from his 
chair, but- looked as if he had 
fallen comfortably asleep in front 
of the vase with his head on his 
arms. Brian had left the vase 
untouched, but had taken one 
other thing, moved by some stir- 
ring of his own never-certain phil- 
osophy and knowing that he 
would not return to this room, 
ever. 



SB 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Another Director had been 
opening a wall cabinet when he 
fell; the small key lay near his 
fingers. Plainly their discussion 
had not been concerned only 
with war, perhaps not at all with 
war — after all, there were other 
topics. ^ The Ming vase would 
have had a part in it. Brian wish- 
ed he could know what the old 
man had meant to choose from 
the cabinet. Sometimes, even now, 
h^reamed of conversations with 
that man, in which the Director 
told him the whole truth about 
that and other matters; but what 
was certainty in sleep was in the 
morning gone like childhood. 

For himself, Brian had taken 
a little image of rock-hard clay, 
blackened, two-faced, male and 
female. Prehistoric, or at any rate 
wholly primitive, unsophisticat- 
ed, meaningful like the blame- 
less motion of an animal in sun- 
light, Brian had said; “With your 
permission, gentlemen.’’ He had 
closed the cabinet and then, soft- 
ly, the outer door. 

“I’m old,” Brian said to the 
red evening. “Old, a little fool- 
ish, talk aloud to myself. I’ll 
have some Mozart before sup- 
per.” 

TTE transferred the fresh veni- 
son from the canoe to a 
small raft hitched inside the 
window. He had selected only 
choice pieces, as much as he 



could cook and eat in the few 
days before it spoiled, leaving the 
rest for the wolves or any other 
forest scavengers who might need 
it. There was a rope strung from 
the window to the marble steps 
that led to the next floor — home. 

It had not been possible to save 
much from the submerged area, 
for its treasure was mostly heavy 
statuary. Through the still water, 
as he pulled the raft along the 
rope, the Moses of Michaelangelo 
gazed up at him in tranquility. 
Other faces watched him. Most 
of them watched infinity. There 
were white hands that occasional- 
ly borrowed gentle motion from 
ripples made by the raft. 

“I got a deer, Moses,” said 
Brian Van Anda, smiling down 
in companionship, losing track of 
time. He carried his juicy burden 
up the stairway. 

His living quarters had once 
been a cloakroom for Museum 
attendants. Four close walls gave 
it a sense of security. A ventilat- 
ing shaft now served as a chim- 
ney for. the wood stove Brian had 
salvaged from a mainland farm- 
house. The door could be tightly 
locked; there were no windows. 
You do not want windows in a 
cave. 

Outside was the Hall of Music, 
an entire floor of the Museum, 
containing an example of every 
musical instrument that was 
known or could be reconstructed 



THE MUSIC MASTER

in the 21st century. The library 
of scores and recordings lacked 
nothing — except electricity to 
play the recordings. A few might 
still be made to sound on a 
spring-wound phonograph, but 
Brian had not bothered with it 
for years; the springs were rusted. 

He sometimes took out the 
orchestra and chamber music 
scores, to read at random. Once 
his mind had been able to furn- 
ish ensembles, orchestras, choirs 
of a sort, but lately the ability 
had weakened. He remembered a 
day, possibly a year ago, when 
fiis memory refused to give him 
the sound of oboe and clarinet in 
unison. He had wandered, peev- 
ish, distressed, unreasonably 
alarmed, among the racks and 
cases of woodwinds in the collec- 
tion, knowing that even if the 
reeds were still good, he could 
not play them. He had never 
mastered any instrument except 
the piano. 

“But even if I could play 
them,” he muttered, now toler- 
antly amused, “I couldn t do it 
in unison, could I? Ah, the things 
that will bother a man!” 

B rian recalled— it was prob- 
ably that same day — opening 
a chest of double basses. There 
was an old three -stringer in the 
group, probably from the early 
19th century, a trifle fatter than 
its modern companions. Brian 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



touched its middle string in an 
idle caress, not intending to make 
it sound, but it had done so. 
When in use, it would have been 
tuned to D; time had slackened 
the heavy murmur to A or some- 
thing near it. That had throbbed 
in the silent room with a sense 
of finality, a sound such as a 
programmatic composer — Tschai- 
kowsky, say, or some other in 
the nadir of torment — might 
have used as a tonal symbol for 
the breaking of a heart. It stayed 
in the air a long time, other in- 
struments whispering a dim re- 
sponse. 

“All right, gentlemen,” said 
Brian. “That was your A.” He 
had closed the case, not laughing. 

but in the main part of the 
hall, a place of honor was given 
to what may have been the old- 
est of all instruments, a seven- 
note marimba of phonolitic schist 
discovered in Indo-China in the 
20th century and thought to be 
at least 5,000 years of age. The 
xylophone-type rack was mod- 
ern: for twenty-five years, Brian 
had obeyed a compulsion to keep 
it clear of cobwebs. Sometimes he 
touched the singing stones, not 
for amusement, but because there 
was an obscure comfort in it. Un- 
concerned with time, they answer- 
ed even to the light tap of a 
fingernail. 

On the west side of the Hall 
of Music, a rather long walk 

THE MUSIC MASTER 



from Brian’s cave, was a small 
auditorium. Lectures, recitals, 
chamber music concerts had been 
given there in the old days. The 
pleasant room held a twelve-foot 
concert grand, made by Steinway 
in 2043, probably the finest of 
the many pianos in the Hall of 
Music. 

Brian had done his best to 
preserve this, setting aside a day 
each month for the prayerful 
tuning of it, robbing other pianos 
in the Museum to provide a re- 
serve supply of strings, oiled 
and sealed up against rust. No 
dirt ever collected on the Stein- 
way. When not in use, it was cov- 
ered with stitched - together 
sheets. To remove the cover was 
a sober ritual; Brian always 
washed his hands with fanatical 
care before touching the keys. 

Some years ago, he had de- 
veloped the habit of locking the 
auditorium doors before he play- 
ed. Even with the doors locked, 
he would not glance toward the 
vista of empty seats — not know- 
ing, nor caring much, whether 
this inhibition had grown from 
a Stone Age fear of seeing some- 
one there or from a flat, reason- 
able certainty that no one could 
be. 

^|'»HE habit might have started 
(he could not remember pre- 
cisely) away back in the year 
2076, when so many bodies had 



91 



drifted down from the north on 
the ebb tides. Full horror had 
somehow been lacking in the 
sight of all that floating death. 
Perhaps it was because Brian had 
earlier had his fill of horrors; or 
perhaps, in 2076, he already felt 
so divorced from his own kind 
that what happened to them was 
like the photograph of a war in 
a distant country. 

Some of the bodies had bobbed 
quite near the Museum. Most of 
them had the gaping wounds of 
primitive warfare, but some were 
oddly discolored — a new pestil- 
ence? So there was (or had been) 
more trouble up there in what 
was (or had been) the Soviet of 
North America, a self-styled “na- 
tion” that took in east New York 
State and some of New England. 

Yes, that was probably the year 
when he had started locking the 
doors between his private con- 
certs and an empty world. 

He dumped the venison in his 
cave. He scrubbed his hands, 
blue-veined now, but still tough, 
still knowing.' Mozart, he thought, 
and walked — not with much 
pleasure of anticipation, but rnore 
like one externally driven — 
through the enormous hall that 
was so full and yet so empty , 
growing dim with evening, with 
dust, with age, with loneliness. 
Music should not be silent. 

When the piano was uncover- 
ed, Brian delayed. He flexed his 



hands unnecessarily. He fussed 
with the candelabrum on the wall, 
lighting three candles, then blow- 
ing out two for economy. He ad- 
mitted presently that he did not 
want the serene clarity of Mozart 
at all right now. This evening, 
the darkness of 2070 was closer 
than he had felt it for a long 
time. It would never have occur- 
red to Mozart, Brian thought, 
that a world could die. Beethoven 
could have entertained the idea 
soberly enough; Chopin prob- 
ably; even Brahms. Mozart 
would surely have dismissed it 
as somebody’s bad dream, in 
poor taste. 

Andrew Carr, who lived and 
died in the latter half of the 20th 
/Century, had endured the idea 
from the beginning of his child- 
hood. The date of Hiroshima was 
1945; Carr was born in 1951; 
the inexhaustible wealth of his 
music was written between 1969, 
when he was eighteen, and 1984, 
when he died in an Egyptian jail 
from injuries received in a street 
brawl. 

“If not Mozart,” said Brian to 
his idle hands, “there is always 
The Project.” 

P LAYING Carr’s last sonata as 
it should be played — as Carr 
was supposed to have said he 
couldn’t play it himself— Brian 
had been thinking of that as The 
Project for many years. It had 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



begun long before the war, at the 
time of his triumphs in a civiliz- 
ed world which had been warmly 
appreciative of the polished in- 
terpretive artist, although no 
more awake than any other age 
to the creative one. Back there in 
the undestroyed society, Brian 
had proposed to program that 
sonata in the company of works 
that were older but no greater, 
and play it — yes, beyond his best, 
so that even critics would begin 
to see its importance. 

He had never done it, had never 
felt that he had entered into the 
sonata and learned the depth of 
it. Now, w^en there was none to 
hear or care, unless maybe the 
harmless brown spiders in the 
corners of the auditorium had a 
taste for music, there was still 
The Project. 

“I hear,” Brian said. “/ care, 
and with myself as audience I 
want to hear it once as it ought 
to be, a final statement for a 
world that couldn’t live and 
yet was too good to die.” 

Technically, of course, he had 
it. The athletic demands Carr 
made on the performer were tre- 
mendous, but, given technique, 
there was nothing impossible 
about them. Anyone capable of 
concert work could at least play 
the notes at the required tempos. 
And any reasonably shrewd pian- 
ist could keep track of the dy- 
namics, saving strength for the 



shattering finale in spite of the 
thunderings that must comt be- 
fore. Brian had heard the sonata 
played by others two or three 
times in the old days — compe- 
tently. Competency was not 
enough. 

For example, what about the 
third movement, that mad Scher- 
zo, and the five tiny interludes of 
sweet quiet scattered through its 
plunging fury? They were not 
alike. Related, perhaps, but each 
one demanded a new climate of 
heart and mind — tenderness, re- 
gret, simple relaxation. Flowers 
bn a flood — no. Warm window- 
lights in a storm — no. The inno- 
cence of an unknowing child in 
a bombed city — no, not really. 
Something of all those, but much 
more, too. 

What of the second movement, 
the Largo, where, in a way, the 
pattern was reversed, the mid- 
night introspection interrupted by 
moments of anger, or longing, or 
despair like that of an angel beat- 
ing his wings against a prison 
of glass? 

It was, throughout, a work in 
which something of Carr’s life 
and Carr’s temperament had to 
come into you, whether you dar- 
ed welcome it or not; otherwise, 
your playing was no more than 
a bumbling reproduction of notes 
on a page. 

Carr’s life was not for the con- 
templation of the timid.

T he details were superficially 
well known. The biographies 
themselves were like musical no- 
tation, meaningless without in- 
terpretation and insight. 

Carr had been a drunken roar- 
er, a young devil-god with such 
a consuming hunger for life that 
he had choked to death on it. His 
friends hated him for the way 
he drained their lives, loving 
them to distraction and always 
loving his work a little more. His 
enemies must have had times of 
helplessly adoring him, if only 
because of an impossible trans- 
parent honesty that made him 
more and less than human. 

A rugged Australian, not tall 
but built like a hero, a face all 
forehead and jaw and glowing 
hyperthyroid eyes. He wept only 
when he jvas angry, the biograph- 
ers said, 'in one minute of talk, 
they said, he might shift from 
gutter obscenity to some extreme 
of altruistic tenderness, and from 
that to a philosophical comment 
of the coldest intelligence. 

He passed his childhood on a 
sheep farm, ran away to sea on a 
freighter at thirteen, studied like 
a slave in London with a single- 
minded desperation, even through 
the horrors of the Pandemic of 
1972. He was married twice and 
twice divorced. He killed a man 
in ah imbecile quarrel on the 
New Orleans docks, and wrote 
his First Symphony while he was 



in jail for that. And he died of 
stab wounds in a Cairo jail. It 
all had relevancy. Relevant or 
not, if the sonata was in your 
mind, so was the life. 

You had to remember also that 
Andrew Carr was the last of civil- 
ization’s great composers. No 
one in the 21st century approach- 
ed him — they ignored his explora- 
tions and carved cherry-stones. 
He belonged to no school, unless 
you wanted to imagine a school 
of music beginning with Bach, 
taking in perhaps a dozen along 
the way, and ending with Carr 
himself. His work was a sum- 
mary and, in the light of the 
year 2070, a completion. 

Brian was certain he could 
play the first movement of the 
sonata acceptably. Technically, 
it was not revolutionary, but 
closely loyal to the ancient so- 
nata form. Carr had even writ- 
ten in a conventional double-bar 
for a repeat of the entire opening 
statement, something that made 
late 20th century critics sneer 
with great satisfaction. It never 
occurred to them that Carr ex- 
pected a performer to use his 
head. 

The bright-sorrowful second 
movement, unfashionably long, 
with its strange pauses, unfore- 
seen recapitulations, outbursts of 
savage change — that was where 
Brian’s troubles began. It did 
not help him to be old, remem- 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bering the inner storms of twenty - 
five years ago and more. 

A S the single candle fluttered, 
Brian realized that he had 
forgotten to lock the door. That 
_ troubled him, but he did not 
rise from the piano chair. He 
chided himself instead for the 
foolish neuroses of aloneness — 
what could it matter? 

He shut his eyes. The sonata 
had long ago been memorized; 
printed copies were safe some- 
where in the library. He played 
the opening of the first move- 
ment, as far as the double-bar; 
opened his eyes to the friendly 
black and white of clean keys 
and played the repetition with 
new light, new emphasis. Better 
than usual, he thought. 

Now that soaring modulation 
into A Major that only Carr 
would have wanted just there in 
just that sudden way, like the 
abrupt happening upon shining 
fields. On toward the climax — I 
am playing it, I think — through 
the intricate revelations of de- 
velopment and recapitulation. 
And the conclusion, lingering, 
half-humorous, not unlike a Bee- 
thoven ending, but with a ques- 
tioning that was all Andrew Carr. 

After that — 

“No more tonight,” said Brian 
aloud. “Some night, though . 
Not competent right now, my 
friend. Fear’s a many-aspect 



thing. But The Project ...” 

He replaced the cover on the 
Steinway and blew out the can- 
dle. He had brought no torch, 
long use having taught his feet 
every inch of the short journey. 
It was quite dark. The never- 
opened western windows of the 
auditorium were dirty, most of 
the dirt on the outside, crusted 
wind-blow salt. 

In this partial darkness, some- 
thing was wrong. 

At first Brian could find no 
source for the faint light, the 
dim orange with a hint of motion 
that had no right to be here. He 
peered into the gloom of the 
auditorium, fixed his eyes on the 
oblong of blacker shadow that 
was the door he meant to use, 
but it told him nothing. 

The windows, of course. He 
had almost forgotten there were 
any. The light, hardly deserving 
the name, was coming through 
them. But sunset was surely well 
past; he had been here a long 
time, delaying and brooding be- 
fore he played. Sunset should not 
flicker. 

So there was some kind of fire 
on the^ mainland. There had been 
no thunderstorm. How could fire 
start, over there where no one 
ever came? 

TTE stumbled a few times, 
swearing petulantly, locat- 
ing the doorway again and grop- 



THE MUSIC MASTER

ing through it into the Hall of 
Music. The windows out here 
were just as dirty; no use tryipg 
to see through them. There must 
have been a time when he had 
enjoyed looking through them. 

He. stood shivering in the 
marble silence, trying to remem- 
ber. 

He could not. Time was a 
gradual eternal dying. Time was 
a long growth of dirt and ocean 
salt, sealing in, covering over 
forever.^ 

He stumbled for his cave, hur- 
rying now, and lit two candles. 
He left one by the cold stove 
and used the other to light his 
way down the stairs to his raft. 
Once down there, he blew it out, 
afraid. The room a candle makes 
in the darkness is a vulnerable 
room. With no walls, it closes in 
a blindness. He pulled the raft 
by the guide-rope, gently, for 
fear of noise. 

He found his canoe tied as he 
had left it. He poked his white 
head slowly beyond the sill, star- 
ing west. 

Merely a bonfire gleaming, red- 
dening the blackness of the cliff. 

Brian knew the spot, a ledge 
almost at water level. At one 
end of it was the troublesome 
path he used ip climbing up to 
the forest. Usable driftwood was 
often there, the supply renewed 
by the high tides. 

“No,” Brian said. “Oh, no . .” 



Unable to accept, or believe, 
or not believe, he drew his head 
in, resting his forehead on the 
coldness of the sill, waiting for 
dizziness to pass, reason to re- 
turn. Then rather calm, he once 
more leaned out over the sill. The 
fire still shone and was therefore 
not a disordered dream of old 
age, but it was dying to a dull 
rose of embers. 

TTE wondered a little about 
time. The Museum clocks 
and watches had stopped long 
ago; Brian had ceased to want 
them. A sliver of moon was hang- 
ing over the water to the east. He 
ought to be able to remember the 
phases, deduce the approximate 
time from that. But his mind 
was too tired or distraught to 
give him the necessary data. 
Maybe it was somewhere around 
midnight. 

He climbed on the sill and, 
with grunting effort, lifted the 
canoe over it to the motionless 
water inside. Wasted energy, he 
decided, as soon as that struggle 
was over. That fire had been lit 
before daylight passed: whoever 
lit it would have seen the canoe, 
might even have been watching 
Brian himself come home from 
his hunting. The canoe’s disap- 
pearance in the night would only 
rouse further curiosity. But 
Brian was too exhausted to lift 
it back.

TJ^HY assume that the maker 
of the bonfire was neces- 
sarily hostile? Might be good 
company. 

Might be . 

Brian pulled his raft through 
the darkness, secured it at the 
stairway, and groped back to his 
cave. 

He then locked the door. The 
venison was waiting, the sight 
and smell of it making him sud- 
denly ravenous. He lit a small 
fire ih the stove, one that he 
hoped would not be still sending 
smoke from the ventilator shaft 
when morning came. He cooked 
the meat crudely and wolfed it 
down, all enjoyment gone at the 
first mouthful. 

He was shocked then to dis- 
cover the dirtiness of his white 
beard. He hadn’t given himself 
a real bath in — weeks? He 
searched for scissors and spent 
an absent-minded while trim- 
ming the beard back to shortness. 
He ought to take some soap — 
valuable stuff — down to Moses’ 
room and wash. 

Clothes, too. People probably 
still wore them. He had worn 
none for years, except for sandals 
and a clout and a carrying satchel 
for his trips to the mainland. He 
had enjoyed the freedom at first, 
and especially the discovery in 
his rugged fifties that he did not 
need clothes even for the soft 
winters, except perhaps a light 



covering when he slept. Then al- 
most total nakedness had become 
so natural, it required no thought 
at all. But the owner of that bon- 
fire — 

He checked his rifles. The .22 
automatic, an Army model from 
the 2040s, was the best. The tiny 
bullets carried a paralytic poison : 
graze a man’s finger and he was 
painlessly dead in three minutes. 
Effective range, with telescopic 
sights, three kilometers; weight, 
a scant five pounds. 

He sat a long time cuddling 
that triumph of military science, 
listening for sounds that did 
not come, wondering often about 
the unknowable passage of night 
toward day. Would it be two 
o’clock. 

He wished he could have seen 
the Satellite, renamed in his 
mind the Midnight Star, but 
when he was down there at his 
port, he had not once looked up 
at the night sky. Delicate and 
beautiful, bearing its everlasting 
freight of men who must have 
been dead now for twenty-five 
years and who would be dead a 
very long time — well, it was bet- 
ter than a clock, Brian often 
thought, if you happened to look 
at the midnight sky at the right 
time of the month when the Man- 
made star could catch the moon- 
light. But he had not seen it to- 
night. 

Three o’clock? 



THE MUSIC MASTER 



97 



A t some time during the long 
dark, he put the rifle away 
on the floor. With studied, self- 
conscious contempt for his own 
weakness, he strode out noisily 
into the Hall of Music with a 
fresh-lit candle. This same bra- 
vado, he knew, might dissolve at 
the first alien noise. While it 
lasted, though, it was invigorat- 
ing. 

The windows were still black 
with night. As if the candle-flame 
had found its own way, Brian 
was standing by the ancient ma- 
rimba in the main hall, the light 
slanting carelessly away from 
his thin, high-veined hand. Near- 
by, on a small table, sat the Stone 
/^ge clay image he had brought 
long ago from the Directors’ 
meeting room on the fifteenth 



floor. It startled him. 

He remembered quite clearly 
how he himself had placed it 
there, obeying a half -humorous 
whim: the image and the singing 
stones were both magnificently 
older, than history, so why 
shouldn’t they live together? 
Whenever he dusted the marim- 
ba, he dusted the image respect- 
fully and its pedestal. It would 
not have taken much urging from 
the impulses of a lonely mind, he 
supposed, to make him place of- 
ferings before it and bow down — 
winking first, of course, to indi- 
cate that rituals suitable to two 
aging gentlemen did not have to 
be sensible in order to be good. 

But now the clay face, re- 
capitulating eternity, startled 
him. Possibly some flicker of the 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




candle had given it a new mim- 
icry of life. 

Though worn with antiquity, 
it was not deformed. The chip- 
ped places were simple honorable 
scars. The two faces stared mild- 
ly from the single head; there 
were plain stylized lines to rep- 
resent folded hands, equally art- 
less marks of sex on either side. 
That was all. The maker might 
have intended it to be a child’s 
toy or a god. 

A wooden hammer of modem 
make rested on the marimba. 
Softly, Brian tapped a few of the 
stones. He struck the shrillest 
one harder, waking ipany slow- 
dying overtones, and laid the 
hammer down, listening until the 
last murmur perished and a drop 
of hot wax hurt his thumb. 



He returned to his cave and 
blew out the candle, thinking of 
the door, not caring that he had, 
in irrational bravado, left it vpr 
locked. Face down, he rolled his 
head and clenched his fingers 
into his pallet, seeking in pain 
and finding at last the relief of 
stormy helpless weeping in the 
total dark. 

Then he slept. 

^^HEY looked timid. The evi- 
-*• dence of it was in their tense 
squatting pose, not in what the 
feeble light allowed Brian to see 
of their faces, which were as 
blank as rock. Hunched down 
just inside the open doorway of 
the cloakroom-cave, a dim morn- 
ing grayness from the Hall of 
Music behind them, they were 
ready for flight. Brian’s intelli- 
gence warned his body to stay 
motionless, for readiness for flight 
could also be readiness for at- 
tack. He studied them, lowering 
his eyelids to a slit. On his pallet 
well inside the cave, he must be 
in deep shadow. 

They were aware of him, 
though, keenly aware. 

They were very young, per- 
haps sixteen or seventeen years 
old, firm-muscled, the man slim 
but heavy in the shoulders, the 
girl a fully developed woman. 
They were dressed alike: loin- 
cloths of some coarse dull fabric 
and moccasins that might be

deerhide. Their hair grew nearly 
to the shoulders and was cut off 
carelessly there, but they were 
evidently in the habit of combing 
it. They appeared to be clean. 
Their complexion, so far as Brian 
could guess it in the meager light, 
was the brown of a heavy tan. 

With no immediate awareness 
of emotion, he decided they were 
beautiful, and then, within his 
own poised, perilous silence, 
Brian reminded himself that the 
young are always beautiful. 

Softly — ^Brian saw no motion 
of her lips — ^the woman mutter- 
ed: “He wake.” 

A twitch of the man’s hand was 
probably meant to warn her to 
be quiet. His other hand clutched 
the shaft of a javelin with a metal 
blade. Brian saw that the blade 
had once belonged to a bread- 
knife; it was polished and shin- 
ing, lashed to a peeled stick. The 
javelin trailed, ready for use at 
a flick of the young man’s arm. 
Brian opened his eyes plainly. 

Deliberately, he sighed. “Good 
morning.” 

The youth said: “Good morn- 
ing, sa.” 

“Where do you come from?” 

“Millstone.” The young man 
spoke automatically, but then his 
facial rigidity dissolved into 
amazement and some kind of 
distress. He glanced at his com- 
panion, who giggled uneasily. 

“The old man pretends to not 



know,” she said, and smiled, and 
seemed to be waiting for the 
young man’s permission to go on 
speaking. He did not give it, but 
she continued: “Sa, the old ones 
of Millstone are dead.” She 
thrust her hand out and down, 
flat, a picture of finality, adding 
with nervous haste: “As the Old 
Man knows. He who told us to 
call him Jonas, she who told us 
to call her Abigail, they are dead. 
They are still-without-moving for 
six days. Then we do the burial 
as they told us. As the Old Man 
knows.” 

“But I don’t know!” said 
Brian, and sat up hn his pallet, 
too quickly, startling them. But 
their motion was backward, readi- 
ness for flight, not for aggression. 
“Millstone? Where is Millstone?” 

B oth looked wholly bewild- 
ered, then dismayed. They 
stood up with splendid animal 
grace, stepping backward out of 
the cave, the girl whispering in 
the man’s ear. Brian caught only 
two words: “Is angry . .” 

He jumped up. “Don’t go! 
Please don’t go!” He followed 
them out of the cave, slowly now, 
aware that he might well be an 
object of terror in the half-dark, 
aware of his gaunt, graceless age 
and dirty hacked-off beard. Al- 
most involuntarily, he adopted 
something of the flat stilted qual- 
ity of their speech: “I will not 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



hurt you. Do not go.” 

They halted. The girl smiled 
dubiously. 

The man said: “We need old 
ones. They die. He who told us 
to call him Jonas said, many days 
in the boat, not with the sun-path, 
he said, across the sun-path, he 
said, keeping land on the left 
hand. We need old ones to speak 
the — to speak . The Old Man 
is angry?” 

“No, I am not angry. I am 
never angry.” Brian’s mind grop- 
ed, certain of nothing. No one had 
come for twenty-five years. Only 
twenty- five? Millstone? 

There was red-gold on the dirty 
eastern windows of the Hall of 
Music, a light becoming softness 
as it slanted down, touching the 
long rows of cases, the warm 
brown of an antique spinet, the 
arrogant clean gold of a 20th 
century harp, the dull gray of 
singing stones five thousand years 
old and a clay face much older 
than that. 

“Millstone?” Brian pointed 
southwest in inquiry. 

The girl nodded, pleased and 
not at all surprised that he should 
know, watching him now with a 
squirrel’s stiff curiosity. Hadn’t 
there once been a Millstone River 
in or near Princeton? He thought 
he remembered that it emptied 
into the Raritan Canal. There 
was some moderately high ground 
around there. Islands now, no 



doubt, or — well, perhaps they 
would tell him. 

“There were old people in Mill- 
stone,” he said, trying for gentle 
dignity, “and they died. So now 
you need old ones to take their 
place.” 

The girl nodded vigorously. A 
glance at the young man was full 
of shyness, possessiveness, maybe 
some amusement. “He who told 
us to call him Jonas said no mar- 
riage can be without the words of 
Abraham.” 

“Abr — ” Brian checked him- 
self. If this was religion, it would 
not do to speak the name Abra- 
ham with a rising inflection, at 
least not until he knew what it 
stood for. “I have been for a long 
time — ” He checked himself 
again. A man old, ugly and 
strange enough to be sacred 
should never stoop to explain 
anything. 

f I ■'HEY were standing by the 
-*■ seven-stone marimba. His 
hand dropped, his thumbnail 
clicking by accident against the 
deepest stone and waking a mur- 
mur. The children drew back 
alarmed. 

Brian smiled. “Don’t be afraid.” 
He tapped the other stones light- 
ly. “It is only music. It will not 
hurt you.” He was silent a while, 
and they were patient and re- 
spectful, waiting for more light. 
He asked carefully: “He who told 



THE MUSIC MASTER 



101 



you to call him Jonas, he taught 
you all the things you know?” 

“All things,” the boy said, and 
the girl nodded quickly, so that 
the soft brownness of her hair 
tumbled about her face, and she 
pushed it back in a small human 
motion as old as the clay image. 

“Do you know how old you 
are?” 

They looked blank. Then the 
girl said: “Oh, summers!” She 
held up both hands with spread 
fingers, then one hand. Three 
fives. As the Old Man knows.” 

“I am very old,” said Brian. “I 
know many things. But some- 
times I wish to forget, and some- 
times I wish to hear what others 
know, even though I may know it 
myself.” 

They looked uncomprehending 
and greatly impressed. Brian felt 
a smile on his face and wondered 
why it should be there. They 
were nice children. Born ten years 
after the death of a world. Or 
twenty perhaps. I think I am 
seventy-six, but did I drop a dec- 
ade somewhere and never notice 
the damn thing? 

“He who told you to call him 
Jonas, he taught you all that you 
know "about Abraham?” 

At sound of the name, both of 
them made swift circular mo- 
tions, first at the forehead, then 
at the breast. 

“He taught us all things,” the 
young man said. “He, and she 



who told us to call her Abigail. 
The hours to rise, to pray, to 
wash, to eat. The laws for hunt- 
ing, and I know the Abraham- 
words for that: Sol-Amra, I take 
this for my need.” 

Brian felt lost again, dismally 
lost, and looked down to the 
grave clay faces of the image for 
counsel, and found none. “They 
who told you to call them Jonas 
and Abigail, they were the only 
old ones who lived with you?” 
Again that look of bewilder- 
ment. “The only ones, sa,” the 
young man said. “As the Old 
Man knows.” 

I could never persuade them 
that, being old, I know very near- 
ly nothing. 

B rian straightened to his full 
gaunt height. The young peo- 
ple were not tall; though stiff and 
worn with age, Brian knew he was 
still a bonily overpowering crea- 
ture. Once, among men, he had 
mildly enjoyed being more than 
life-size. 

As a shield for the lonely, 
frightened thing that was his 
mind, he put on a phony stern- 
ness: “I wish to examine you 
about Millstone and your knowl- 
edge of Abraham. How many 
others are living at Millstone? 

“Two fives, sa,^’ said the boy 
promptly, “and I who may be 
called Jonason and this one we 
may call Paula. Two fives and 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



two. We are the biggest, we two. 
The others are only children, but 
he we call Jimi has killed his 
deer. He sees after them now 
while we go across the sun-path.” 

Under Brian’s questioning, 
more of the story came, haltingly, 
obscured by the young man’s 
conviction that the Old Man al- 
ready knew everything. Some 
time, probably in the middle 
2080s, Jonas and Abigail (who- 
ever they were) had come on a 
group of twelve wild children 
who were keeping alive somehow 
in a ruined town where their eld- 
ers had all died. Jonas and Abi- 
gail had brought them all to an 
island they called Millstone. 

Jonas and Abigail had come 
originally from “up across the 
sun-path” — the boy seemed to 
mean north — and they had been 
very old, which might mean any- 
thing between thirty and ninety, 
in teaching the children primitive 
means of survival, Jonas and Abi- 
gail had brought off a brilliant 
success: Jonason and Paula were 
well fed, shining with health and 
cleanliness and the strength of 
wildness, and their speech had not 
been learned from the ignorant. 
Its pronunciation faintly sug- 
gested New England, so far as 
Brian could detect any local ac- 
cent at all. 

“Did they teach you reading 
and writing?” he asked, and made 
writing motions on the flat of his 

THE MUSIC MASTER 



palm, which the two watched in 
vague alarm. 

The boy asked: “What is 

that?” 

“Never mind.” He thought: / 
could quarrel with some of your 
theories. Mister whom I may call 
Jonas. “Well, tell me now what 
they taught you of Abraham.” 

Both made again that circular 
motion at forehead and breast, 
and the young man said with the 
stiffness of recitation: ‘Abraham 
was the Son of Heaven, who died 
that we might live.” 

^TTHE girl, her obligations dis- 
charged with the religious 
gesture, tapped the marimba shy- 
ly, fascinated, and drew her finger 
back sharply, smiling up at Brian 
in apology for her naughtiness. 

“He taught the laws, the ever- 
lasting truth of all time,” the boy 
recited, almost gabbling, “and 
was slain on the wheel at Nuber 
by the infidels. Therefore, since 
he died for us, we look up across 
the sun-path when we pray to 
Abraham Brown, who will come 
again.” 

Abraham Brown? 

But — 

But / knew him, Brian thought, 
stunned. I met him once. Nuber? 
Newburg, the temporary capital 
of the Soviet of — oh, the hell with 
that. Met him in 2071 — he was 
102 years old then, could still 
walk, speak clearly, even remem- 

103 



ber an unimportant concert of 
mine from years before. I could 
have picked him up in one hand, 
but nobody ivas ever more alive. 
The wheel? 

“And when did he die, boy?” 
Brian asked. 

Jonason moved fingers help- 
lessly, embarrassed. “Long, long 
ago.” He glanced up hopefully. 
“A thousand years? I think he 
who told us to call him Jonas 
did not ever teach us that.” 

“I see. Never mind.” Oh, my 
good Doctor — after all! Artist, 
statesman, student of ethics, phil- 
osopher — you Said that if men 
knew themselves, they would 
have the beginning of wisdom. 
Your best teacher was Socrates. 
Well you knew it, and now look 
what’s happened! 

Jonas and Abigail— r-some vis- 
ionary pair, Brian supposed, 
maybe cracking up under the 
ghastliness of those years. Ad- 
mirers of Brown, perhaps. Shock- 
ed, probably, away from the re- 
ligions of the 21st century, which 
had all failed to stop the horrors, 
nevertheless they needed one, or 
were convinced that the children 
did — so they created one. There 
must later have been some dizzy- 
ing pride of creation in it, pos- 
sibly wholehearted belief in them- 
selves, too, as they found the 
children accepting it, building a 
ritual life around it. 

It was impossible, Brian 



thought, that Jonas and Abigail 
could have met the living Abra- 
ham Brown. As anyone must 
who faces the limitations of hu- 
man intelligence. Brown had ac- 
cepted mysteries, but he did not 
make them. He was wholly with- 
out intellectual arrogance. No one 
could have talked with him five 
minutes without hearing him say 
tranquilly; “I don’t know.” 

The wheel at Nuber? 

The wheel? 

B rian realized he could never 
learn how Brown had actually 
died. Even if he had the strength 
and courage to go back- north — 
no, at seventy-six (eighty-six?), 
one can hardly make a fresh start 
in the study of history. Not with- 
out the patience of , Abraham 
Brown himself, who had probably 
been doing just that when the 
wheel — 

An awed question from the girl 
pulled Brian from a black pit of 
abstraction: “What is that?” She 
was pointing to the clay image in 
its dusty sunlight. 

Brian spoke vaguely, almost 
deaf to his own words until they 
were past recovering: “That? It is 
very old. Very old and very 
sacred.” She nodded, round-eyed, 
and stepped back a pace or two. 
“And that — that was all they 
taught you of Abraham Brown?” 
Astonished, the boy asked: “Is 
it not enough?”

There is always The Project. 
“Why, perhaps.” 

“We know all the prayers. Old 
Man.” 

“Yes, I’m sure you do.” 

“The Old Man will come with 
us.” 

“Eh?” There is always The 
Project. “Come with you?” 

“We look for old ones,” said 
the young man. There was a new 
note in his voice, and the note 
was impatience. “We traveled 
many days, up across the sun- 
path. We want you to speak the 
Abraham-words for marriage. 
The Old Ones said we must not 
mate as the animals do without 
the words. We want — ” 

“Marry, of course,” said Brian 
feebly, rubbing his great, long- 
fingered hand across his face so 
that the words were blurred and 
dull. “Naturally. Beget. Replen- 
ish the Earth. I’m tired. I don’t 
know any Abraham-words for 
marriage. Go on and marry. Try 
again. Try — ” 

“But the Old Ones said — ” 
“Wait!” Brian cried. “Wait! 
Let me think. Did he — he who 
told you to call him Jonas, did 
he teach you anything about the 
world as it was in the old days, 
before you were born?” 

“Before? The Old Man makes 
fun of us.” 

“No, no.” And since he now 
had to fight down physical fear 
as well as confusion, Brian spoke 

THE MUSIC MASTER 



more harshly than he intended: 
“Answer my question! What do 
you know of the old days? I was 
a young man once, do you under- 
stand? As young as you. What do 
you know about the world I lived 
in?” 

J ONASON laughed. There was 
new-born doubt in him as well 
as anger, stiffening his shoulders, 
narrowing his innocent gray eyes. 
“There was always the world,” 
he said, “ever since God made it 
a thousand years ago.” 

“Was there? I was a musician. 
Do you know what a musician 
is?” 

The young man shook his head, 
watching Brian — too alertly, 
watching his hands, aware of him 
in a new way, no longer humble. 
Paula sensed the tension and did 
not like it. 

She said worriedly, politely: 
“We forget some of the things 
they taught us, sa. They were 
Old Ones. Most of the days, they 
were away from us in — places 
where we were not to go, pray- 
ing. Old Ones are always pray- 
ing.” 

“I will hear this Old Man 
pray,” said Jonason. The butt of 
the javelin rested against Jona- 
sori’s foot, the blade swaying from 
side to side. A wrong word, any 
trifle, Brian knew, could make, 
them decide in an instant that 
he was evil and not sacred. Their 

105 



religion would certainly require 
a devil. 

He thought also: Merely one 
of the many ways of dying. It 
would be swift, which is always 
a consideration. 

“Certainly you may hear me 
pray,” said Brian abruptly. 
“Come this way.” In a fluctuating 
despair, he knew that he must 
not become angry, as a climber 
stumbling at the edge of a cliff 
might order himself not to be 
careless. “Come this way. My 
prayers — I’ll show you. I’ll show 
you what I did when I was a 
young man in a ''World you never 
knew.” 

He stalked across the Hall of 
Music, not looking behind, but 
his back sensed every glint of 
light on that bread-knife javelin. 

“Come this way!” he shouted. 
“Come in here!” He flung open 
the door of the auditorium and 
strode up on the platform. “Sit 
down over there and be quiet!” 

They did, he thought — he could 
not look at them. He knew he 
was muttering, too, between his 
noisy outbursts, as he snatched 
the cover off the Steinway and 
raised the lid, muttering bits 
and fragments from old times, 
and from the new times. 

“They went thataway. Oh, Mr. 
Van Anda, it just simply goes 
right through me; I can’t express 
it. Madam, such was my inten- 
tion — or, as Brahms is supposed 



to have said on a slightly differ- 
ent subject, any ass knows that. 
Brio, Rubato and Schmalz went 
to sea in a- — Jonason, Paula, this 
is a piano. It will not hurt you. 
Sit there, be quiet, listen.” 

He found calm. Now if ever, 
now when I have living proof 
that human nature (some sort of 
human nature^ is continuing — 
surely now, if ever. The Project-^ 

W ITH the sudden authority 
that was natural to him, 
Andrew Carr took over. In the 
stupendous opening chords of the 
introduction, Brian very nearly 
forgot his audience. Not quite, 
though. The youngsters had sat 
down out there in the dusty re- 
gion where none but ghosts had 
lingered for twenty-five years or 
more. The piano’s first sound 
brought them to their feet. Brian 
played through the first four bars, 
piling the chords like mountains, 
then held the last one with the 
pedal and waved his right hand at 
Jonason and Paula in a furious 
downward motion. 

He thought they understood. 
He thought he saw them sit down 
again, but he could pay them 
scant attention now, for the son- 
ata was coming alive under his 
fingers, waking, growing, rejoic- 
ing. 

He did not forget the young- 
sters again. They were important, 
terrifying, too important, at the 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fringe of awareness. But he could 
not look at them any more. He 
shut his eyes. 

He had never played like this 
in the flood of his prime, in the 
old days, before great audiences 
that loved him. Never. 

His eyes were still closed, hold- 
ing him secure in a secret world 
that was not all darkness, when 
he ended the first movement, 
paused very briefly, and moved 
on with complete assurance to 
explore the depth and height of 
the second. This was a true state- 
ment at last. This was Andrew 
Carr; he lived, even if, after this 
late morning, he might never 
live again. 

And now the third, the storm 
and the wrath, the interludes of 
calm, the anger, denials, affirma- 
tions. Was there anything he 
didn’t know, this heir of three 
centuries who died in jail? 

Without hesitation, without 
any awareness of self, of age or 
pain or danger or loss, Brian was 
entering on the broad reaches of 
the last movement when he 
opened his eyes. 

The youngsters were gone. 

Well, he thought, it’s too big. 
It frightened them away. He 
could visualize them, stealing out 
with backward .looks of panic. 
Incomprehensible thunder. But 
he could not think much about 
them now. Not while Andrew 
Carr was with him. He played on 



with the same assurance, the same 
joyful sense of victory. Savages — 
let them go, with leave and good 
will. 

OOME external sound was 
^ faintly troubling him, some- 
thing that must have begun under 
cover of these rising, pealing oc- 
tave passages — storm waves, each 
higher than the last, until it 
seemed that even a superhuman 
swimmer must be exhausted. An 
undefinable alien noise, a kind of 
humming. 

Brian shook his head peevishly, 
shutting it away. It couldn’t mat- 
ter, at least not now. Everything 
was here, in the beautiful labors 
his hands still had to do. The 
waves were growing more quiet, 
settling, subsiding, and now he 
must play those curious arpeggios 
which be had never quite under- 
stood — but, of course, he under- 
stood them at last. Rip them out 
of the piano like showers of 
sparks, like distant lightnings 
moving farther off across a world 
that could never be at rest. 

The final theme. Why, it was a 
variation — and how was it that he 
had never realized it? — a varia- 
tion on a theme of Brahms, from 
the German Requiem. Quite 
plain, quite simple, and Brahms 
would have approved. Still it was 
rather strange, Brian thought, 
that he had never made the 
identification before in spite of all 



THE MUSIC MASTER 



107 



his study. Well, he knew it now. 
Blessed are the dead ... 

Yes, Brian thought, but some- 
thing more remained, and he 
searched for it, proudly certain of 
discovering it, through the 
mighty unfolding of the finale. 
No hurrying, no crashing im- 
patience any more, but a mov- 
ing through time with no fear of 
time, through radiance and dark- 
ness with no fear of either. An- 
drew Carr was happy, the light 
of the Sun on his shoulders. 

That they may rest from their 
labors, and their works do follow 
after them. 

Brian stood up, swaying and 
out of breath. So the music was 
over, and the young savages were 
gone, and somewhere a jangling, 
humming confusion was filling 
the Hall of Music, distant, but 
entering with violence even here, 
now that the piano was silent. 
Brian moved stiffly out of the 
auditorium, more or less knowing 
what he would find. 

The noise was immense, the 
unchecked overtones of the ma- 
rimba fuming and quivering as 
the high ceiling of the Hall of 
Music caught and twisted them, 
flung them back against the an- 
swering strings of harps and 
pianos and violins, the sulky 
membranes of drums, the nervous 
, brass of cymbals. 

The girl was playing it. Really 
playing it. 



B rian laughed once, softly, 
in the shadows, and was not 
heard. She had hit on a most 
primeval rhythm natural for chil- 
dren or savages and needed noth- 
ing else, hammering it out swiftly 
on one. stone and then the next, 
wanting no rest or variation. 

The boy was dancing, slapping 
his feet, pounding his chest, 
thrusting out his javelin in per- 
fect time to the clamor, edging up 
to his companion, grimacing, 
drawing back to return. Neither 
was laughing or close to laughter. 
Their faces were savage-solemn, 
downright grim with the excite- 
ment, the innocent lust, as spon- 
taneous as the drumming of part- 
ridges. 

It was a while before they saw 
Brian in the shadows. 

The girl dropped the hammer. 
The boy froze briefly, his javelin 
raised, then jerked his head 
slightly at Paula, who snatched 
at something. Only moments later 
did Brian realize that she had 
taken the clay image before she 
fled. Jonason covered her retreat, 
stepping backward, his face blank 
with fear and readiness, javelin 
poised. So swiftly, so easily, by 
grace of a few wrong words and 
Steinway’s best, had a Sacred 
Old One become a Bad Old One, 
an evil spirit. 

They were gone, down the 
stairway, leaving the echo of 
Brian’s voice crying: “Don’t go! 



108 



galaxy science fiction 



Please don’t go! I beg you!’’ 
Brian followed them unwill- 
ingly. It was a measure of his 
unwillingness that moments pass- 
ed before he was at the bottom 
of the stairway looking across 
the shut-in water to his raft, 
which they had used and left at 
the window-sill port. Brian had 
never been a good swimmer; he 
was too dizzy now and short of 
breath to attempt to reach it. 

He clutched the rope and 
hitched himself, panting, hand 
over hand, to the window, col- 
lapsing there a while until he 
found strength to scramble into 
his canoe and grope for the pad- 
dle. The youngsters’ canoe was 
already far off, heading up the 
river, the boy paddling with deep 
powerful strokes. 

Up the river, of course. They 
had to find the right kind of Old 
Ones. Up across the sun-path. 

Brian dug his blade in the 
quiet water. For a time, his 
rugged ancient muscles were will- 
ing. There was sap in them yet. 
Perhaps he was gaining slightly. 

He shouted hugely: “Bring 

back my two-faced god! Bring 
it back! It’s not yours. It’s not 
yours.>” 

^HEY must have heard his 
voice booming at them. At 
any rate, the girl looked back' 
once. The boy, intent on his 
effort, did not. 



Brian roared: “Bring back my 
god! I want my little god!” 

He was not gaining on them. 
They had a mission, after all. 
They had to find the right kind 
of Old Ones. But damn it, Brian 
thought, my world has some 
rights, hasn’t it? We'll see about 
this. 

He lifted the paddle like a 
spear and flung it, knowing even 
before his shoulder winced how 
absurd the gesture was. The 
youngsters were so far away that 
even an arrow from a bow might 
not have reached them. 

The paddle splashed in the 
water. Not far away: a small in- 
finity. It swung about to the will 
of the river, the heavy end point- 
ing obediently downstream. It 
nuzzled companipnably against 
a gray-faced chunk of driftwood, 
diverting it, so that presently the 
driftwood floated into Brian’s 
reach. 

He caught it, and flung it to- 
ward the paddle, hoping it might 
fall on the other side and send 
the paddle near him. It fell short, 
and in his oddly painless extrem- 
ity, Brian was not surprised, but 
merely watched the gray drift- 
wood floating and bobbing along 
beside him with an irritation that 
was part friendliness, for it sug- 
gested the face of a music critic 
he had met in — New Boston, was 
it? Denver? London? He couldn’t 
remember.

“Why,” he said aloud, de- 
tachedly observing the passage of 
his canoe beyond the broad morn- 
ing shadow of the Museum of 
Human History, “I seem to have 
made sure to die.” 

“Mr. Van Anda has abundant- 
ly demonstrated a mastery of the 
instrument and of the — ” You

“and of the literature which

canoe, the gray-faced chip moved 
tranquilly, placidly approving, . 
toward the open sea. And with a 
final remnant of strength, Brian 
inched forward to the bow of the 
canoe and gathered the full force 
of his lungs to shout up the river: 
“Go in peace!”

him. They were too far away-’Snd

"I'd give a year off my life 
to . Idle talk now, but it 
was ghastly reality to Kent! 




H oward Kent looked at 
his young and beautiful 
wife and felt the weight 
of the years rest on his shoulders. 
In her eyes he saw his heavily 
lined face and sagging, stooped 
shoulders. 

They stood just inside the long, 
narrow reception room of the Hu- 
man Rejuvenation Plant. Potted 
palms and formal chairs remind- 
ed one of a Human Disposal unit. 

“I have a confession to make, 
darling,” he said. 

“Oh^ no, Howard. Not now'. I 
take for granted you’ve done 
the usual things in your youth.” 
“But . .” 

“And we needn’t have hurried 
so, as you can see. Now we’ll 



probably have to wait hours in 
this perfectly dismal place.” 

She looked as young and fresh 
as he looked old and dusty, he 
thought, so out of place in this 
kind of establishment. 

He had always loved small wo- 
men. Leah was small and viva- 
cious and dressed a year ahead of 
styles. No matter what happen- 
ed, he’d never regret having mar- 
ried her. 

“But this is something I should 
have told you before,” he said. 

She put her hand on his arm. 
“I’ve been perfectly happy these 
past six months. Whatever it was, 
I forgive you.” 

“It’s not that. I’m talking about 
my age. I didn’t think you’d mar-

never even looked at the 

silly old thing.” 

“Well, darling, I looked at 
yours and felt a little guilty in 
marrying a young girl of twenty- 
three. But the fact is I’m sixty- 
five. I’ve been rejuvenated be- 
fore.” 

“I rather suspected it when 
you started aging so suddenly 
last week,” she said. ‘ Before that 
you didn’t look a day over thirty. 
But it doesn’t matter.” 

“It’s worse than that, Leah.” 
His face worked convulsively. 
“I’ve been here twice before. 
This is my third trip.” 

“I’m too modern to act shock- 
ed, Howard. If you didn’t want to 
tell me before, dear, it’s perfectly 
all right.” 

“Look, darling!” Perspiration 
stood on his forehead. “You don’t 
seem to understand. But then you 
never could add or subtract. Now 
listen carefully. Each trip clips 
five years off your life span. 

“Everyone knows that, of 
course. But it’s better to be 
young ...” 

“It’s better to be alive than 
dead,” he said harshly. 

“But your doctors have given 
you a longevity span to the age 
of ninety.” 



“Suppose it was eighty, instead 
of ninety?” 

“Oh, dear, you worry too 
much,” she said. “Doctors don’t 
make such mistakes.” 

“They can’t give me a guar- 
antee. You see, three of my an- 
cestors died from accidents. The 
prediction of ninety years is bas- 
ed on the assumption that they 
would have lived a normal life- 
time.” 

“They make few guarantees. 
You know, all of you men are 
such babies at a time like this.” 
“Yes, but if it is eighty— then. 
I’ll come out not a rejuvenated 
man, but just a handful of dust.” 
“Oh, that can’t happen.” 

“T OOK at it this way.” He 
paused a moment while tak- 
ing in her youthful appearance. 
“From now on I wouldn’t look 
much older. Just a little grayer 
and perhaps more stooped. Then, 
I’ll have what’s left of my lortgev- 
ity plus the five years this re- 
juvenation would clip off. 

“Why, Howard, dear.” Leah 
sounded shocked. “You dont 
know what you’re talking about. 
An aunt of mine elected that 
choice and it was perfectly hor- 
rible. She drooled the last few 
years of her life and was helpless 
as a baby.” 

“Why didn’t they use Euthan- 
asia?” he asked. 

“The courts decided she was- 



112 



galaxy science fiction 



n’t capable of making a rational 
decision.” 

He wiped his forehead. “That 
would be a long time off, darl- 
ing. We’d have so much time to- 
gether in the next fifteen years.” 
“But what would it be like if 
you were crippled with arthritis 
or some other disease?” 

“You could divorce me if that 
happens.” 

“I can also divorce you if you 
don’t go through with rejuvena- 
tion. You know it’s the law.” 
“You wouldn’t do that.” His 
face was more lined than ever. 

“Don’t be silly, dear. Nobody 
gets old these days. Who would 
remain our friends? Why, every- 
where we’d go, people would 
point us out. Oh, no, life would- 
n’t be livable.” 

“That sounds like a cruel and 
calculating decision to me,” 
Howard said. “Either I take a 
chance on dying or you’ll divorce 
me.” ^ 

“You have no right to make 
such an accusation. I married a 
young man who said he was 
thirty years old. Six months later 
I discover he’s sixty-five. Now 
who’s cruel and calculating?”' 
“Please, darling, I didn’t mean 
it. Look,” he pleaded, “I’ll even 
sign permission for you to have 
a lover. There’s that young fel- 
low that’s always around. Maybe 
it’s happened already.” 

She stood back from him. 



“Howard, you’re being perfectly 
nasty. Just like an aged person 
you read about.” 

“Five million dollars, and all 
of it youfs when I die a natural 
death.” He put his hands in his 
pockets. 

F^HE street door opened just 
then and a young man came 
toward them with a light springy 
step. 

He offered his hand to Howard 
who -took it slpwly. “How are 
you, skipper? And you, Leah? I 
came as soon as I got your mes- 
sage.” 

“He’s worried, Mike.” Leah’s 
face had brightened. “And now 
he’s insisting on growing old.” 

“I’ve been through the wringer 
twice before, you see,” Howard 
said in a low voice. 

“I don’t think you have much 
to worry about,” Mike said. 
“Those medics know their busi- 
ness.” 

“Aging is a nasty process.” 
Leah wrinkled her nose as if she 
smelled something offensive. 
“Maybe you can convince him, 
Mike.” 

“Leah is right, you know,” 
Mike said. “A few years ago I 
visited the old age home. There’s 
only one left. You’d be surprised 
at the amount of suffering old 
people go through before they 
die; cancer, angina, broken bones, 
strokes, arthritis. Rejuvenation

won’t work on extremely old 
bodies. Longevity has run out.” 
“Why does it have to clip off 
five years?” worried Howard. 

“It’s the old-age governor they 
found in the pituitary gland. 
They can turn it back, but the 
shock takes off about five years.” 
“Oh, I know what’s in the 
medical articles,” Howard growl- 
ed. “Remember, I’ve been 
through here twice before. But 
the Sun was so warm this morn- 
ing. It was like seeing everything 
for the last time. I felt like sit- 
ting down and letting everything 
drift.” 

“That’s a sure sign that you 
really need rejuvenating,” s^id 
Leah. “After it’s over you’ll be 
making me a golf widow again. 
Won’t he, Mike?” 

“Of course. He’ll come out rar- 
ing to go.” 

Howard looked from Mike to 
Leah and back at Mike. Age was 
no match for youth. If love had- 
n’t started between them already, 
it would soon. 



A t the end of the long room, 
a door opened and two 
nurses entered, starched and an- 
tiseptic. 

“Your room is ready, Mr. 
Kent,” one nurse said. 

Howard shuddered. “Every- 
thing is so horribly familiar. The 
pill to erase the worry, which 
doesn’t work. The cart you ride 
on which makes you feel like a 
carcass. The little bump as you 
enter the regeneration room. 
Then you get a hypodermic and 
crawl into a long boiler t^nk.” 
“You’re just nervous, dear,” 
said Leah. 

“A dismal, miasmic cloud set- 
tles on your mind and you de- 
cide you wouldn’t go through it 
again for anything in the world.” 
Mike put his arm around Leah 
as if it were the most natural 
thing in the world. “He’ll be all 
right, my darling.” 

Howard looked at them and 
then turned wearily to the nurse. 
“I’m ready.” 

The nurse walked down the

CHILDREN OF THE WIND 
by Burgess Drake. J. B. Lippin- 
cott Co., $3.50 

1 MUST admit in advance that 
I have gone off the deep end 
for this book. It is not for the 
devotees of space adventures or 
sociological anti-utopias; it is 
much more for lovers of James 
Stephens, Kenneth Grahame, and 
(more specifically the E. B. 
White of Stuart Little or the 
Theodore Sturgeon of More 
Than Human. 

It is almost perfect of its kind, 
a “novel of the imagination” in 



the best English tradition of 
gentle but pointed fantasy, writ- 
ten in a warm, moving, richly 
evocative style that only occa- 
sionally gives the impression of 
being slightly precious. 

The story is — on the surface — 
the standard one of poltergeist 
phenomena, a “ghost-haunt” in 
a typical many-roomed and lux- 
uriantly gardened English man- 
sion, complete with servants in 
the servants’ quarters and all the 
rest of it. But it is so much more 
than that! 

For one thing, it is “written 
by” one of the two poltergeists

that cause all the disturbances, a 
lad named Tri;cie. He tells of his 
mother, childless Mary Hilary, 
her heel of a British politician 
husband — and of the twins, Janet 
and himself, who never lived, but 
were “kindled into being” by 
Mary’s wanting them. 

Nothing can be more enchant- 
ing and tragic than the delicate 
building up of the character of 
the little non-material lad as he 
tells of his equally ephemeral sis- 
ter, and of their relations to the 
physical characters in the book. 

I know it may all sound a 
bit ridiculous to the hard-boiled 
and thfe serious-minded, but I 
assure you it is not — not, that is, 
if you still care for the sort of 
poetic fantasy that today, alas, 
seems to be almost extinct. If 
you do enjoy such “stuff as 
dreams are made on,” please do 
not pass up this lovely book.

THE ALTERED EGO by Jerry 
Sohl. Rinehart & Co., $2.50 

S OHL’S fourth science fiction 
offering is just as slick, fast- 
moving, melodramatic and essen-

This one deals with the old “im- 
mortality” idea. of renewing — or 
even copying — the brains and 
bodies of the deserving dead, so 
they can keep on being valuable 
to society. 

A nefarious tytnch of charac- 
ters try to subvert this noble 
scheme to their own base ends, 
but are defeated by the son of 
a man who has been murdered 
and then disagreeably miscopied, 
and by the inevitable pinup hero- 
ine with “blonde hair, bronzed 
shoulders, small waist and long 
legs.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



TF you want a really disagree- 
able and almost pointless ex- 
perience in reading, I recommend 
this wordy pseudo-imitation of 
Gulliver’s Travels to your maso- 
chistic attention. 

An interplanetary exploration 
crew is mysteriously stranded on 
an unknown planet which the 
literary-minded gents on the ship 
name Thalia. 

They go through interminably 
gruesome adventures among the 
K o d 1 i k s , vegetable - wormlike 
creatures whose society seems to 
be intended to satirize some sort 
of rigid traditionalist theocracy. 
The Gromliks, squarish beings 
who serve the author as a blunt- 
edged parody on communism; 
and two other groups, the Vim- 
liks and the Optliks, the nature 
of which will forever be unknown 
to me, since I just quit reading 
at that dismal point. 

Of course, this may be the 
greatest satire since 1984, but 
somehow I doubt it. 

RETURN TO TOMORROW by 
L. Ron Hubbard. Ace Books, Inc., 
25c 

“AS mass approaches infinity, 
time approaches zero.” This 
relativity concept is the basis of 
a fast-paced and grim adventure 
by the manufacturer of diane- 
tics. 

The story, which first appeared 

★ ★ * * * SHELF 



under the title “To The Stars” in 
Astounding back in 1950, devel- 
ops the notion that the crews of 
interstellar ships age only months 
while they are in transit, while on 
Earth people age decades, even 
centuries. 

The crews thereby become a 
class apart, having no. friends, 
no families, no durable human 
contacts other than their crew 
mates. Yet the faster-than-light 
ships still go out, for they have a 
crucial function; the saving of 
the human race. 

Hubbard’s melodramatifc de- 
velopment of this thesis is just 
short of absurdity, but interest- 
ing nevertheless. 

COSMIC MANHUNT by L. 
Sprague de Camp; RING 
AROUND THE SUN by Clif- 
iord Simak. Ace Books, Inc., 35c 

^HE newest Ace “double” gives 

you a reprint of Simak’s rich- 
ly imaginative novel that first ap- 
peared in this magazine and then 
was hard-covered by Simon and 
Schuster, and publishes for the 
first time since its original seriali- 
zation in Astounding one of de 
Camp’s Krishnan series, original 
title “The Queen of Zamba.” 

De Camp gets around the 
problem of subjective time dif- 
ferences that laid the ground- 
work for the plot of Hubbard’s 
novel (see above) by having peo-

pie on Earth who want to remain 
the same age as star travelers 
take “trance pills.” Very simple. 

Otherwise, this is a cops-and- 
robbers adventure on a planet 
whose natives are still in a pre- 
industrial stage of development. 

It involves a hunt for the run- 
away daughter of a rich Levan- 
tine (Earthian) who has eloped 
to said planet with a typical de 
Campian adventurer named Fal- 
lon. 

It’s fast-moving and moderate- 
ly sophisticated entertainment, 
bubble-light though not bubble- 
headed. and considerably below 
the author’s best. 

Simak’s offering makes up for 

it. 

THE YEAR AFTER TOMOR- 
ROW, edited by Lester del Rey, 
Cecile Matschat and Carl Car- 
met. The John C. Winston Co., 
$3.00 

T his nine-story anthology for 
young people consists of three 
tales each by Carl H. Claudy and 
Peter van Dresser, all taken from 
the back files of The American 
Boy, two by del Rey from As- 
founding, and one by Robert 
Moore Williams (the only “A” 
story in the book — The Red 
Death of Mars”) also from As- 
tounding. One of Claudy s stor- 
ies, “The Land of No Shadow,” 
is also worth attention, as is del 



Key’s offering, “Kindness.” 

The rest are run-of-the-mill 
kid stuff, not bad, but none merit- 
ing hard covers. 

TROUBLE ON TITAN by Alan 
E. Nourse; ROCKETS TO NO- 
WHERE by Philip St. John; 
THE SECRET OF SATURN’S 
RINGS by Donald A. WoUheim. 
The John C. Winston Co., $2.00 
each 

H ere are three more exciting 
space operas in the Winston 
series of science fiction juveniles, 
making 24 in all (including the 
anthology reviewed above). None 
make any pretense at depth or 
seriousness of purpose, but they 
are all good clean adventure 
without viciousness or unneces- 
sary brutality. 

Two deal with aspects of Sa- 
turn, the Nourse book being more 
real than the Wollheim, which is 
in the old tradition of Villains in 
the Pay of the Vested Interests 
Versus the Idealistic Professor 
and his Daring Young Son; but 
both are easy to read. 

St. John’s book, dealing with 
the problems of security in a fu- 
ture America, where almost every 
thing that is important is “tpp 
secret,” is likewise a good thril- 
ler, but it has the added attrac- 
tion of a pretty pointed rnoral. 
It has a nice gimmick, too, in the 
form of an “invisible” space sta-

tion. You’ll be surprised at what 
it turns put to be. 

MEL OLIVER AND SPACE 
ROVER ON MARS by William 
Morrison. Gnome Press, $2.50 

fTIHIS juvenile has one quality 
none of the items reviewed 
above can claim: simple charm. 
It is much nearer to the delight- 
ful Heinlein formula, as evi- 
denced in his series of young peo- 
ple’s books for Scribner, than any 
of the volumes in the Winston 
series I have yet read. 

The tale is, I suppose, strictly 
for youngsters, even though I 
enjoyed it. (What does that make 
me?) Yet because of the warm 
realization of all the characters 
and the vividness of the space- 
ship and Martian backgrounds, 
it has a vitality that is most ap- 
pealing. 

There is a boy stowaway and 
also an almost “human” collie 
named Space Rover. They be- 
come involved with an inter- 
planetary circus run by a Mar- 
tian strongman and a Venusian 
india-rubber type. There are 
plots and counter-plots, all kinds 
of crises and to-be-expected sur- 
prises, a girl (very nice), and the 
usual allotment of villains. 

But the whole is more than the 



stun of its parts because of the 
strong feeling of identification 
one has with the leading charac- 
ters. 

I’d call the book a worth- 
while item for the young and also 
for us older folk who are in 
search of vicarious escape. 

THE NATURE OF LIGHT 
AND COLOUR IN THE OPEN 
AIR by M. Minnaert. Dover 
Publications, Inc., paper, $1.95 

1 1 ■'HIS unusual book describes 
and explains a hundred or 
more of the common (and un- 
common) physical phenomena 
that occur because of the ex- 
istence of the Earth’s atmosphere, 
the nature of the Sun’s light, and 
the curious construction of the 
human eye. 

It covers everything from rain- 
bows to halos around street lights, 
from luminescent clouds to glow- 
worms. 

You’d be surprised how much 
you don’t know about some of 
the simplest asp>ects of light as it 
works its miracles and mysteries 
in the air of our planet. I don’t 
think a book like this has ever 
been done before, either, which 
should make it particularly 
worthy of your attention.

The Age of 
Kindness 

By ARTHUR SELLINGS 

There was only one way for 
Bruno to be like everybody 
, . get rid of all of them! 



A ROUGHER, earlier age 
would have looked the 
other way when he 
passed by. But now they refused 
to notice any difference in him. 
They admitted him into their 
company, invited him to join 
their fun. It was he who turned 
away. 

An earlier age would have 
feared him. Whispers would have 
been exchanged across back 
fences. No smallest crime could 
have been left unsolved in the 
neighborhood without being laid 
darkly at his door. But there was 
hardly any crime. There were no 
back fences. The only whispers 
were the ones in his own head. 



And they never stopped. 

He would have been taunted 
with nicknames by a cruder peo- 
ple. They would have called him 
Humpy because he was a hunch- 
back. They would have called 
him Shorty because he was small. 
They would have called him 
Smily because his face was freak- 
ed in a perpetual expression 
whose only resemblance to a 
smile was coincidental. 

Yet if he’d been in danger, or 
if anyone had lifted a hand 
against his twistedness, some of 
those who called him names 
would have leaped to his defense. 
But in the era in which he was 
born, none would have thought to

124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mock him, none to lift a hand 
against him, none to have a 
chance to defend him. 

If he had been bom three 
hundred years before, in the 
Twentieth Century, he would 
have found an ungainly balance. 
He would have seen others like 
himself. He would have estab- 
lished a shy, unspoken com- 
munion with them, and with all 
things piteous, misshapen, bro- 
ken, flawed. And he might have 
learned to tend a spark of beauty 
in his heart, knowing that most 
of the people about him were as 
twisted in their souls as he was 
in his body. 

But in this age there were no 
others like him. Everybody else 
was straight, both in body and 
soul. The making of a human 
was a science and an art now. 
There had been no such accident 
as himself for several genera- 
tions. 

An earlier people would have 
looked upon him at birth, and 
with a brutal mercy they might 
have killed him. 

But this was the age of light 
. the age of kindness. 

H e squinted up at the long, 
brilliant shape. “Where is it 
going to?’’ he asked. 

They smiled .gently, laying 
aside their tools. They had heard 
of Bruno, knew that he roamed 
from place to place just as peo- 



ple had in the Dark Ages. All the 
same they looked at the name 
stenciled on the breast of his 
tunic before replying. To have 
used his name without doing this 
would have been impolite, draw- 
ing attention to the fact that his 
deformity was widely known. 

“We hope it will go to a star, 
Bruno.” 

“Why do you only hope?” 

“Because it is very difficult. 
Once men thought it would be 
easy. They thought they had it 
all solved. Ten years, they 
thought, twenty ^at the most, and 
they’d reach the Moon. As easily 
as that.” 

“That was three hundred years 
ago,” his companion put in. 

“It has taken all this time, 
then?” 

“Well, not exactly. We’ve only 
just started up again these last 
few years. You see, back in the 
Dark Ages they had two dreams. 
One was a good dream, by their 
standards. The oth«r was a night- 
mare. The nightmare nearly 
came true. The dream stayed 
just a dream. For the nightmare 
all but blotted out the dream, 
what with the war, the rebuild- 
ing after, lack of tools and re- 
sources. And they had other 
concerns. They had to conquer 
themselves first before they could 
conquer space. Because the tech- 
niques that could annihilate 
space could annihilate Man, too.” 



THE AGE OF KINDNESS 



125 



“And now you can do it?” 

“Yes, I think so. We can try, 
anyway. We have to. People 
have never forgotten that dream. 
In a way they’ve gone past it. 
But all the other things that peo- 
ple thought so worthwhile before 
they were accomplished, so that 
now we can say that was good, 
or that was bad, but either way 
it was done. But space travel is a 
parabola that was never traced. 
A leap that was halted in mid-air. 
An asymptote that was striven 
for, but never reached.” 

“You’re talking over the lad’s 
head,” said the other technician. 

The first technician gave him a 
warning look. His words implied 
a criticism, a recognition of Bru- 
no’s deficiency. “Bruno under- 
stands, don’t you, Bruno? It’s a 
kind of lingering sadness that’s 
been in people all this time. 
We’ve got to do it at least once, 
then everybody can get on with 
their work in peace.” 

B y now, Bruno should have 
reached the limits of conver- 
sation. A few sentences, a minute 
or two, was as much as he could 
normally stand before conscious- 
ness of his own ugliness made 
him break off and flee. But now 
he felt something stir inside him 
which made him oblivious to that. 
Here was a chiming with old 
dreams, a new chapter to the yel- 
lowed books he’d read. 



“But that’s wrong,” he said. 
“People shouldn’t just leave it 
there. They should go on and on 
like the old explorers over the 
oceans. Like Cabot and Colum- 
bus, Vasco da Gama and Magel- 
lan.” He knew their names, all 
of that great company of lone 
adventurers, sailing on and on 
away from the crowded and fa- 
miliar cities, out into the solitary 
unknown. 

The two technicians looked at 
him gently. 

“That was a long time ago,” 
one of them answered. “Things 
have changed since then. Men 
have changed. One return trip 
to Venus and everybody will be 
content. Even if the ship should 
crash or not be able to return, 
one word by radio would be 
enough. Man knows of the Uni- 
verse within now. That is far 
richer than the one outside. The 
one within is endless. The one 
outside is finite; it curves back 
on itself.” 

“Venus,” said Bruno, dwelling 
on the word. “The Evening Star. 
But the Moon is closer. Why isn’t 
the ship going to the Moon first?” 

“Because,” said the technician, 
“it takes a man time to get used 
to the changes of space. After 
leaving Earth he has to adapt 
himself to space, then he has to 
adapt himself to landing. Going 
to the Moon, those processes 
would come too close together. 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



By going to one of the planets, 
the pilot has enough 4 time to 
adapt. Do you see?” 

Bruno seemed not to hear him. 
He stood there, thought puckering 
his face even more than usual. 

“Well,” said the other tech- 
nician. “We have to get on with 
our work, otherwise nobody will 
get anywhere.” He turned away, 
his companion with him. 

“Wait,” said Bruno. “How 
many will go on this trip?” 

They turned back, carefully 
concealing their impatience. 

“Only one. Machines will do 
all the work except piloting.” 
“Do you think — ?” He hopped 
up and down clumsily in his ex- 
citement. “Do you think / could 
be that one?” 

They looked' at him, then at 
each other. One bit his lip, the 
other looked at his feet. Neither 
spoke. 

“But can’t I? I could learn how 
to fly it.” 

One answered him. “It’s not 
that. Bruno. There isn’t too much 
to learn. It’s all set down in a 
series of numbers for the takeoff 
and landing. We could probably 
send a pilotless craft, but that 
wouldn’t be the same thing, would 
it? Anyway, they’ve already se- 
lected the pilot.” 

“But they can change him, 
can’t they? If it’s as you say — 
that they just want to do it this 
once and then they’ll be satis- 

THE AGE OF KINDNESS 



fled — then surely nobody especi- 
ally wants to go. But I do. I 
want to go!” 

“It’s not that, Bruno. You see 
— ” But they couldn’t say it. “Go 
ask Dr. Marcus in Main Block 
there. He’ll explain.” 

l^R. Marcus was a kind man. 

He was also a man with 
abundant self-control. When 
Bruno made his request, he only 
lifted his eyebrows — no more of 
a gesture than he would have 
given had it been anybody else. 

“Hm-mm.” He stroked his chin. 
“I’m afraid not, Bruno. You see, 
the pilot has to be fit and strong.” 

“But I’m fit. I’m strong. I’ve 
got strong hands. I can bend an 
inch bar of iron with my bare 
hands. I know I could control 
it!” 

“I’m afraid it’s not as easy 
as that. The pilot must be pre- 
pared to go through great stress. 
It isn’t only in his hands that he 
needs strength. He has to be — ” 
He spread his hands, leaving his 
sentence unfinished. 

Tears of helpless anger started 
in Bruno’s eyes. “You mean 
straight and perfect! Like any- 
one but me. That’s what you 
mean, isn’t it? But if there’s all 
that stress how do you know that 
any pilot would come out of it 
straight and perfect?” 

“We don’t,” Dr. Marcus said 
quietly. “But he’s got to start 



127 




that way. The man we’re send- 
ing up has had exhaustive tests 
to make sure he can stand it.” 
“Well, test me.” 

“I’m sorry, I couldn’t do that. 
Don’t you see? It wouldn’t test 
you. It would kill you.” 

“I don’t mind taking the 
chance. My life’s not precious to 
me the way other peoples’ are to 
them. And I’ve got freedom of 
choice by the statute.” 

“So you have. But so have I, 
and I wouldn’t do it. Anyway, 
there isn’t time. Everything’s all 
set. The tests take weeks, and the 
ship takes off tomorrow morn- 
ing.” He relaxed, smiling. “Now 
there’s a fact that a lot of peo- 
ple don’t know. We’re not making 
any fuss about the attempt. The 
big news will be given out if we 
succeed. Tell you what I can do, 
though-. If you’re so interested. 
I’ll arrange for you to be in the 
Communications Room and you 
can follow the flight all the way. 
Then you — ” 

“It doesn’t matter,” Bruno said 
bitterly, cutting across his speech. 
“I’m sorry I bothered you.” He 
turned to hide the tears. 

Dr. Marcus kept a set smile 
on his face. “No bother, Bruno. 
No bother at all. Any time — ” 
But Bruno was gone. 

A LL the rest of that day he 
watched the ship from be- 
hind a dune in the desert, gaz- 



ing, gazing, until the long silvery 
shape outlined against the sky 
seemed to become the shining 
symbol of the only hope he’d 
ever had in his life. The only 
one, that was, except the impos- 
sible one — to be straight and per- 
fect. 

He saw technicians climb the 
ladder with portable tools and 
meters. As evening came and the 
light faded from the sky, day- 
light lamps took over. And then 
the technicians descended the 
ladder one by one. He heard their 
laughing voices as they made 
their way back to the ring of 
buildings that surrounded the 
ship. After a little while the 
lamps were turned off, and the 
ship became only a black finger 
against the night sky. 

Bruno came out from his hid- 
ing place. 

He walked calmly up to the 
ring of buildings, waiting cau- 
tiously in the shadow of one of 
them to make sure the coast was 
clear. He heard laughter and 
voices coming from a nearby 
building, saw, through its win- 
dows, men eating. There was not 
another soul in sight. 

He broke out of the shadows 
and went scuttling across the 
three-hundred-yard radius that 
separated him from the ship. He 
would have prayed aloud as he 
ran, if the mere exertion of run- 
ning hadn’t needed all his energy. 



THE AGE OF KINDNESS

As it was, his prayer was like an 
unspoken agony in his breast. 

He covered the last twenty 
yards like someone in a night- 
mare, expecting, every second, 
the sound of alarmed voices, 
the flashing of lights. But none 
came. He sank, panting, in the 
shadow of the tail assembly. 
Anxiously he cast his gaze all 
around. Nothing stirred. There 
were no guards set over the ship. 
In this day and age, that was a 
precaution nobody thought neces- 
sary. 

As soon as he had recovered 
his breath, he mounted the lad- 
der. It was on the side of the ship 
in shadow from the thin light 
of the new Moon. The port was 
poised on massive gimbals, and. 
swung enough at his touch to 
admit his squirming body. 

Once inside, he was safe. The 
short passageway that tunneled 
from the port led to only one 
place — the control room. It was 
lit faintly but adequately by the 
lights from innumerable meters 
and gauges. Now that his own 
trembling had subsided, he could 
feel the almost imperceptible 
tremor of the ship, a slight quiver 
as of immense power straining 
to be released. He sank into the 
pilot’s couch seat. 

A ll that night he spent exam- 
ining the controls and read- 
ing the manuals. A lot of it he 



couldn’t understand, but that 
didn’t matter. He found the chart 
giving the series of control opera- 
tions; that was the important 
thing. He checked the numbers 
with the levers, the wheels, the 
gauges. 

Nobody came aboard the ship. 
It was evidently all ready. All 
that was left now was the entry 
of the pilot in the morning, the 
depressing of levers — and take- 
off. 

And by the time morning came, 
Bruno, too, was ready. He wait- 
ed until he saw signs of stirring 
in the camp, saw one or two 
figures moving out from the 
sleeping quarters. 

Then he closed the port, lay 
back on the couch, gave one final 
check to the firing series and 
stretched out his hand. His last 
thought v/as an unsuccessful at- 
tempt to imagine the expressions 
on all the faces below when the 
gray morning should suddenly 
erupt into flaming thunder. And 
then he felt the cool metal of the 
levers at his fingertip. He closed 
his eyes and pressed . 

After the gray-out came agony, 
red and blinding. His body was 
part of the ship, flattened and 
fused into oneness with the burn- 
ing metal and the thundering 
rockets. He was so much a part 
of it that all of the energy pass- 
ed through him, through tortured 
sinews and shrieking nerves. And 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



yet a part of him, a tiny part, re- 
mained free of it, standing be- 
yond all pain, watching and 
rejoicing, knowing dimly but 
surely that he had survived the 
first shock. 

Though his brain was no long- 
er a thinking apparatus — but 
only a receptor and switchboard 
of pain — that precious little he 
realized, though his senses were 
lost in a hurricane, his ears 
stuffed with thunder, his eyes 
filled with a red smoke. 

When at last he could clear his 
eyes he could still see redness — 
the red of his own blood. It was 
spilled down the front of his 
tunic. He tasted the stickiness of 
it on his lips, felt it like phlegm 
in his throat. Yet his only 
thought was one of gratitude that 
he had been spared to see and 
to taste and to feel again, be- 
cause he had not dared to hope 
for so much. 

The tiny part of him that had 
stood aside and rejoiced — will, 
essential spark, or whatever — 
seemed to grow, triumphant over 
the flesh and its fallibility. It 
grew to full stature when, with 
frantic thought, he looked down 
at the levers to press the next 
ones in the series. They were al- 
ready down. Somehow, through 
that purgatory, that bystanding 
spark had operated his bludgeon- 
ed brain to do its will; 

For the first time in his life 

THE AGE OF KINDNESS 



Bruno smiled a smile that was 
not merely an accident of the 
flesh. 

1 1 ■’HERE followed the days of 
free fall, the days of respite 
while the pain of his body ebbed. 
Once h6 was seized with an 
hours-long spasm of coughing 
that drenched him with blood. 
And he thought he would die, 
that the crucifixion of the take- 
off had torn something vital in- 
side him. But he didn’t care, be- 
cause he had had his first sight 
of space, diamond-sharp and 
depthless, by then. And he re- 
covered. 

By the time the braking rock- 
ets were due to be applied, he 
was well again. It was as they 
had said on Earth — the Earth 
that was becoming more-and more 
distant and unreal. They had 
been right about the body having 
to adapt itself. But they’d also 
been wrong — because it didn’t 
need a straight body, only 
strength of purpose and a burn- 
ing desire to succeed. 

Perhaps, he found pleasure in 
thinking, even one with a straight 
body would have succumbed, 
lacking that purpose. The straight 
ones back on Earth hadn’t the 
right outlook. What could be 
achieved by an attitude that saw 
space travel only as a clearing 
up of something left undone — 
an end rather than a beginning? 

131 



Thinking like that, he did not 
touch the radio all through the 
trip. 

It was only as he approach- 
ed the white face of Venus that 
he reached over to it. After all, 
he owed it to them to give them 
a reply. If it hadn’t been for 
them and their work he would 
never have had sight of space. 

He would have to speak now. 
He could not rely upon the mir-, 
acle of will to see him through 
the braking, the landing orbit, 
the final descent into the clouds. 
He flipped the switch. 

A voice came through faintly 
over the black distances. “Bruno, 
are you all right? Bruno, are you 
all right? Bruno — ’’ It went on 
and on without ceasing. It made 
him feel guilty to think of the 
weeks and weeks they must have 
been sending out that message 
without reply. Doubtless, it was 
recorded by now. But back there 
they must be waiting, keeping 
vigil over their receiver. They 
were kind, considerate people 
They . just didn’t understand, that 
was all. 

He switched over to the trans- 
mitter and spoke. “This is Bru- 
no. I am all right. I am landing 
on Venus. Even if I crash, I 
can’t help but make it now.’’ 
He switched off. He took one 
look at the receiver, then he 
shook his head and settled onto 
the couch . 



A ll was silence after the thun- 
der of the jets, the screaming 
of air past the scorched sides of 
the ship. He lay there watching 
the ceiling. He looked down and 
saw no blood this time, only 
vomit. At takeoff, pain had blan- 
keted the lesser wrench of nausea. 
But on landing, with its sudden 
shifts and decelerations, nausea 
had come into its own. He felt 
exhausted and lay there a long 
time. 

Finally, when he thought he 
could manage it, he tottered to 
his feet, clutching at a stanchion 
for support. He drank and ate, 
and felt better. Then he cleaned 
himself up. He had learned dur- 
ing the flight how the atmosphere 
meter worked. He checked it and 
found that the air outside was 
breathable. He operated the lock 
and climbed out onto the ladder. 

All around was grassland, 
stretching to the horizon in every 
direction. He could make out 
patches of color that must be 
flowers. Color, too, hovered in 
the air like butterflies or clouds of 
pollen. The air was warm and 
heavy with tantalizing odors, 
pungencies of strange balsams, 
scents of unknown nectars. And 
there was something else, too. 
The whisper of wings. Of many 
wings. He craned his head up- 
ward — 

— And there they were. A flight 
of winged creatures, half bird.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



half diaphanous-winged insect. 

They were all looking at him 
with a soft, unhostile gaze as 
their bodies turned and planed 
in the air. As he looked up at 
them, they broke into a chorus 
of dovelike cooing. Then they 
dropped from the sky and gath- 
ered at the foot of the ladder. 
They waited there, looking up at 
him, their cooing muted to a 
murmur. 

Bruno felt no fear. They look- 
ed too gentle to hurt anyone. All 
he felt was a confusion that made 
the blood mount to his cheeks. 
He was not used to the gaze of so 
many eyes. He turned to flee 
back into the rocket. 

A twittering broke out at his 
gesture of retreat. It sounded 
strangely like disappointment. 
Then one voice sang out clearly 
in a soft chanting. Out of curi- 
osity he looked down over his 
twisted shoulder. 

O NE of the creatures had step- 
ped forward. The rest had 
fallen back into a semicircle be- 
hind it It was almost as if the 
one in the middle were chanting 
an address of welcome. As Bruno 
looked down it broke off its song, 
cooed excitedly and cocked its 
head to one side. Its big, yellow 
eyes seemed to look up beseech- 
ingly. It made little flapping mo- 
tions with its wings. 

And then Bruno realized the 



truth. That it didn’t matter. That 
even a perfect and straight hu- 
man being would be as strange 
to these creatures as he was. 
These gentle creatures below 
might be themselves only the 
stunted remnants of a nobler 
race. How would he know? And 
what difference would it make? 

On a sudden impulse he de- 
scended the ladder. Six rungs 
from the bottom he turned and 
faced them, his back to the lad- 
der, his strong hands grasping it. 

“My name is Bruno,’’ he be- 
gan. “I come from the planet 
Earth. I — ’’ Did it matter if he 
went on? They couldn’t under- 
stand him. It was only a for- 
mality. And yet, as his lips came 
to the next words, they trembled. 
How could he utter them, even to 
creatures who could not under- 
stand them, without committing 
something close to blasphemy? 

He scanned the wide eyes of 
the creatures, realizing that for 
the first time in his life he could 
meet the gaze of so many with- 
out feeling ashamed, without 
turning away. Why shouldn’t he 
go on? It was not the outer shell 
that mattered, that made him 
what he was. He finished his sen- 
tence. 

“I am a man,’’ he said firmly 
and clearly. 

And then he climbed down the 
last six rungs of the ladder.

BIC ANCESTOR 

By F. L. WALLACE 

Man's family tree was awesome enough to 
give every galactic race an inferiority 




GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I N repose, Taphetta the Rib- 
boneer resembled a fancy 
giant bow on a package. His 
1 four flat legs looped out and in, 
the ends tucked under his wide, 
t thin body, which constituted the 
knot at the middle. His neck 
■“ was flat, too, arching out in an- 
other loop. Of all his features, 
only his head had appreciable 
^ thickness and it was crowned 
I with a dozen long though nar- 
i' rower ribbons. 



Taphetta rattled the head 
fronds together in a surprisingly 
good imitation of speech. “Yes, 
I’ve heard the legend.’’ 

“It’s more than a legend,’’ 
said Sam Halden, biologist. The 
reaction was not unexpected — 
non-humans tended to dismiss 
the data as convenient specula- 
tion and nothing more. “There 
are at least a hundred kinds of 
humans, each supposedly origi- 
nating in strict seclusion on as 




many widely scattered planets. 
Obviously there was no contact 
throughout the ages before space 
travel — and yet each planetary 
race can interbreed with a mini- 
mum of ten others! That’s more 
than a legend — one hell of a lot 
more!” 

“It is impressive,” admitted 
Taphetta. “put I find it mildly 
distasteful to consider mating 
with someone who does not be- 
long to my species.” 

“That’s because you’re unique,” 
said Halden. “Outside of your 
own world, there’s nothing like 
your species, except superficially, 
and that’s true of all other crea- 
tures, intelligent or not, with the 
sole exception of mankind. Ac- 
tually, the four of us here, though 
it’s accidental, very nearly repre- 
sent the biological spectrum of 
human development. 

“Emmer, a Neanderthal type 
and our archeologist, is around 
the beginning of the scale. I’m 
from Earth, near the middle, 
though on Emmer’s side. Mere- 
dith, linguist, is on the other side 
of the middle. And beyond her, 
toward the far end, is Kelburn, 
mathematician. There’s a corre- 
sponding span of fertility. Emmer 
just misses being able to breed 
with my kind, but there’s a fair 
chance that I’d be fertile with 
Meredith and a similar though 
lesser chance that her fertility 
may extend to Kelburn.” 



T aphetta rustled his speech 
ribbons quizzically. “But I 
thought it was proved that some 
humans did originate on one 
planet, that there was an un- 
broken line of evolution that 
could be traced back a billion 
years.” 

“You’re thinking of Earth,” 
said Halden. “Humans require a 
certain kind of planet. It’s rea- 
sonable to assume that, if men 
were set down on a hundred such 
worlds, they’d seem^to fit in with 
native life-forms on a few of 
them. That’s what happened on 
Earth; when Man arrived, there 
was actually a manlike creature 
there. Naturally our early evo- 
lutionists stretched their theories 
to cover the facts they had. 

“But there are other worlds in 
which humans who were there 
before the Stone Age aren’t re- 
lated to anything else there. We 
have to conclude that Man did- 
n’t originate on any of the planets 
on which he is now found. In- 
stead, he evolved elsewhere and 
later was scattered throughout 
this section of the Milky Way.” 
“And so, to account for the 
unique race that can interbreed 
across thousands of light-years, 
you’ve brought in the big ances- 
tor,” commented Taphetta dryly. 
“It seems an unnecessary simpli- 
fication.” 

“Can you think of a better ex- 
planation?” asked Kelburn. 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Something had to distribute one 
species so widely and it’s not 
the result of parallel evolution — 
not when a hundred human races 
are involved, and only the hu- 
man race.” 

“I can’t think of a better ex- 
planation.” Taphetta rearranged 
his ribbons. “Frankly, no one else 
is much interested in Man’s 
theories about himself.” 

It was easy to understand the 
attitude. Man was the most num- 
erous though not always the most 
advanced — Ribboneers had a civ- 
ilization as high as anything in 
the known section of the Milky 
Way, and there were others — 
and humans were more than a 
little feared. If they ever got 
together — but they hadn’t except 
in agreement as to their common 
origin. 

Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer 
was an experienced pilot and 
could be very useful. A clear 
statement of their position was 
essential in helping him make up 
his mind. “You’ve heard of the 
adjacency mating principle?” 
asked Sam Halden. 

“Vaguely. Most people have if 
they’ve been around men.” 

“We’ve got new data and are 
able to interpret it better. The 
theory is that humans who can 
mate with each other were once 
physically close. We’ve got a list 
of all our races arranged in se- 
quence. If planetary race F can 



mate with race E back to A and 
forward to M, and race G is fer- 
tile only back to B, but forward 
to O, then we assume that what- 
ever their positions are now, at 
once time G was actually adja- 
cent to F, but was a little further 
along. When we project back into 
time those star systems on which 
humans existed prior to space 
travel, we get a certain pattern. 
Kelburn can explain it to you.” 
The normally pink body of the 
Ribboneer flushed slightly. The 
color change was almost imper- 
ceptible, but it was enough to in- 
dicate that he was interested. 

I^ELBURN went to the pro- 
jector. “It would be easier if 
we knew all the stars in the Milky 
Way, but though we’ve explored 
only a small portion of it, we 
can reconstruct a fairly accurate 
representation of the past.” 

He pressed the controls and 
stars twinkled on the screen. 
“We’re looking down on the 
plane of the Galaxy. This is one 
arm of it as it is today and here 
are the human systems.” He 
pressed another control and, for 
purposes of identification, certain 
stars became more brilliant. 
There was no pattern, merely a 
scattering of stars. “The whole 
Milky Way is rotating. And while 
stars in a given region tend to 
remain together, there’s also a 
random motion. Here’s what hap- 



BIG ANCESTOR 



137 



pens when we calculate the posi- 
tions of stars in the past.” 

Flecks of light shifted and flow- 
ed across the screen. Kelburn 
stopped the motion. 

“Two hundred thousand years 
ago,” he said. 

There was a pattern of the 
identified stars. They were spac- 
ed at fairly equal intervals along 
a regular curve, a horseshoe loop 
that didn’t close, though if the 
ends were extended, the lines 
would have crossed. 

Taphetta rustled. “The math 
is accurate?” 

“As accurate as it can be with 
a million-plus body problem.” 
“And that’s the hypothetical 
route of the unknown ancestor?” 
“To the best of our knowledge,” 
said Kelburn. “And whereas there 
are humans who are relatively 
near and not fertile, they can al- 
ways mate with those they were 
adjacent to two hundred thou- 
sand years ago!” 

“The adjacency mating prin- 
ciple. I’ye never seen it demon- 
strated,” murmured Taphetta, 
flexing his ribbons. “Is that the 
only era that satisfies the calcu- 
lations?” 

“Plus or minus a hundred thou- 
sand years, we can still get some- 
thing that might be the path of a 
spaceship attempting to cover a 
representative section of terri- 
tory,” said Kelburn. “However, 
we have other ways of dating it. 



On some worlds on which there 
are no other mammals, we’re able 
to place the first human fossils 
chronologically. The evidence is 
sometimes contradictory, but we 
believe we’ve got the time right.” 
Taphetta waved a ribbon at 
the chart. “And you think that 
where the two ends of the curve 
cross is your original home?” 
“We think so,” said Kelburn. 
“We’ve narrowed it down to sev- 
eral cubic light-years — then. 
Now it’s far more. And, of course, 
if it were a fast-moving star, it 
might be completely out of the 
field of our exploration. But 
we’re certain we’ve got a good 
chance of finding it this trip.’’ 

“It seems I must decide quick- 
ly.” The Ribboneer glanced out 
the visionport, where another 
ship hung motionless in space 
beside them. “Do you mind if I 
ask other questions?” 

“Go ahead,” Kelburn invited 
sardonically. “But if it’s not 
math, you’d better ask Halden. 
He’s the leader of the expedition.” 
Halden flushed; the sarcasm 
wasn’t necessary. It was true 
that Kelburn was the most ad- 
vanced human type present, but 
while there were differences, bio- 
logical and in the scale of intel- 
ligence, it wasn’t as great as once 
was thought. Anyway, non-hu- 
mans weren’t trained in the fine 
distinctions that men made 
among themselves. And, higher 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



or lower, he was as good a biol- 
ogist as the other was^ a mathe- 
matician. And there was the 
matter of training; he’d been on 
several expeditions and this was 
Kelburn’s first trip. Damn it, he 
thought, that rated some respect. 

The Ribboneer shifted his at- 
tention. “Aside from the sudden 
illness of your pilot, why did you 
ask for me?” 

“We didn’t. The man became' 
sick and required treatment we 
can’t give him. Luckily, a ship 
was passing and we hailed it be- 
cause it’s four months to the 
nearest planet. They consented to 
take him back and told us that 
there was a passenger on board 
who was an experienced pilot. 
We have men who could do the 
job in a makeshift fashion, but 
the region we’re heading for, 
while mapped, is largely un- 
known. We’d prefer to have an 
expert — and Ribboneers are 
famous for their navigational 
ability.” 

Taphetta crinkled politely at 
the reference to his skill. “I had 
other plans, but I can’t evade 
professional obligations, and an 
emergency such as this should 
cancel out _ any previous agree- 
ments. Still, what are the in- 
centives?” 

Sam Halden coughed. “The 
usual, plus a little extra. We’ve 
copied the Ribboneer’s standard 
nature, simplifying it a little and 



adding a per cent here and there 
for the crew pilot and scientist’s 
share of the profits from any dis- 
coveries we may make.” 

“I’m complimented that you 
like our contract so well,” said 
Taphetta, “but I really must have 
our own unsimplified version. If 
you want me, you’ll take my con- 
tract. I came prepared.” He ex- 
tended a tightly bound roll that ^ 
he had kept somewhere on his 
person. 

They glanced at one another 
as Halden took it. 

“You can read it if you want,” 
offered Taphetta. “But it will take 
you all day — it’s micro-printing. 
However, you needn’t be afraid 
that I’m defrauding you. It’s hon- 
ored everywhere we go and we go 
nearly everywhere in this sector — 
places men have never been.” 

There was no choice if they 
wanted him, and they did. Be- 
sides, the integrity of Ribboneers 
was not to be questioned. Halden 
signed. 

“Good.” Taphetta crinkled. 
“Send it to the ship; they’ll for- 
ward it for me. And you can tell 
the ship to go on without me.” 

He rubbed his ribbons together. 
“Now if you’ll get me the charts. 

I’ll examine the region toward 
which we’re heading.”

grace. He seemed to have diffi- 
culty in taking his eyes off Mere- 
dith, though, since he was a 
notch or so above her in the mat- 
ing scale, he shouldn’t have been 
so interested. But his planet had 
been inexplicably slow in devel- 
oping and he wasn’t completely 
aware of his place in the human 
hierarchy. 

Disdainfully, Meredith adjust- 
ed a skirt that, a few inches 
shorter, wouldn’t have been a 
skirt at all, revealing, while do- 
ing so, just how long and beau- 
tiful a woman’s legs could be. Her 
people had never given much 
thought to physical modesty and, 
with legs like that, it was easy 
to see why. 

Muttering something about 
primitive women, Firmon turned 
to the biologist. “The pilot doesn’t 
like our air.” 

“Then change it to suit him. 
He’s in charge of the. ship and 
knows more about these things 
than I do.” 

“More than a man?” Firmon 
leered at Meredith and, when she 
failed to smile, added plaintively, 
“I did try to change it, but he 
still complains.” 

H ALDEN took a deep breath. 
“Seems all right to me.” 
“To everybody else, too, but 
the tapeworm hasn’t got lungs. He 
breathes through a million tubes 
scattered over his body.” 



It would do no good to explain 
that Taphetta wasn’t a worm, 
that his evolution had taken a 
different course, but that he was 
in no sense less complex than 
Man. It was a paradox that some 
biologically higher humans hadn’t 
developed as much as lower races 
and actually weren’t prepared for 
the multitude of life-forms they’d 
meet in space. Firmon’s reaction 
was quite typical. 

“If he asks for cleaner air, it’s 
because his system needs it,” 
said Halden. “Do anything you 
can to give it to him.” 

“Can’t. This is as good as I 
can get it. Taphetta thought you 
could do something about it.” 
“Hydroponics is your job. 
There’s nothing I can do.” Hal- 
den paused thoughtfully. “Is 
there something wrong with the 
plants?” 

“In a way, I guess, and yet not 
really.” 

“What is it, some kind of toxic 
condition?” 

“The plants are healthy 
enough, but something’s chewing 
them down as fast as they grow.” 
“Insects? There shouldn’t be 
any, but if there are, we’ve got 
sprays. Use them.” 

“It’s an animal,” said Firmon. 
“We tried poison and got a few, 
but now they won’t touch the 
stuff. I had electronics rig up 
some traps. The animals seem to 
know what they are and we’ve 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



never caught one that way.” 

Halden glowered at the man. 
“How long has this been going 
on?” 

“About three months. It’s not 
bad; we can keep up with them.” 

It was probably nothing to be- 
come alarmed at, but an animal 
on the ship was a nuisance, 
doubly so because of their pilot. 

“Tell me what you know about 
it,” said Halden. 

“They’re little things.” Firmon 
held out his hands to show how 
small. “I don’t know how they got 
on, but once they did, there were 
plenty of places to hide.” He 
looked up defensively. “This is 
an old ship with new equipment 
and they hide under the machin- 
ery. There’s nothing we can do 
except rebuild the ship from the 
hull inward.” 

Firmon was right. The new 
equipment had been installed in 
any place just to get it in and 
now there were inaccessible corn- 
ers and crevices everywhere that 
couldn’t be closed off without re- 
building. 

They couldn’t set up a con- 
tinuous watch and shoot the ani- 
mals down because there weren’t 
that many men to spare. Besides, 
the use of weapons in hydroponics 
would cause more damage to the 
thing they were trying to protect 
than to the pest. He’d have to 
devise other ways. 

Sam Halden got up. “I’ll take 



a look and see what I can do.” 

“I’ll come along and help,” said 
Meredith, untwining her legs and 
leaning against him. “Your mis- 
tress ought to have some sort of 
privileges.” 

Halden started. So she knew 
that the crew was calling her 
that! Perhaps it was intended 
to discourage Firmon, but he 
wished she hadn’t said it. It 
didn’t help the situation at all. 

f I lAPHETTA sat in a chair de- 
signed for humans. With a 
less flexible body, he wouldn’t 
have fitted. Maybe it wasn’t sit- 
ting, but his flat legs were folded 
neatly around the arms and his 
head rested comfortably on the 
seat. The head ribbons, which 
were his hands and voice, were 
never quite still. 

He looked from Halden to Em- 
mer and back again. “The hy- 
droponics tech tells me you’re 
contemplating an experiment. I 
don’t like it.” 

Halden shrugged. “We’ve got 
to have better air. It might work.” 

“Pests on the ship? It’s filthy! 
My people would never tolerate 
it!” 

“Neither do we.” 

The Ribboneer’s distaste sub- 
sided. “What kind of creatures 
are they?” 

“I have a description, though 
I’ve never seen one. It’s a small 
four-legged animal with two an-

tennae at the lower base of its 
skull. A typical pest.” 

Taphetta rustled. “Have you 
found out how it got on?” 

“It was probably brought in 
with the supplies,” said the biolo- 
gist. “Considering how far we’ve 
come, it may have been any one 
of a half a dozen planets. Any- 
way, it hid, and since most of 
the places it had access to were 
near the outer hull, it got an extra 
dose of hard radiation, or it may 
have nested near the atomic en- 
gines; both are possibilities. Eith- 
er way, it mutated, became a 
different animal. It’s developed a 
tolerance for the poisons we spray 
on plants. Other things it detects 
and avoids, even electronic traps.” 
“Then you believe it changed 
mentally as well as physically, 
that it’s smarter?” 

“I’d say that, yes. It must be 
a fairly intelligent creature to be 
so hard to get rid of. But it can 
be lured into traps, if the bait’s 
strong enough.” 

“That’s what I don’t like,” said 
Taphetta, curling. “Let me think 
it over while I ask questions.” He 
turned to Emmer. “I’m curious 
about humans. Is there anything 
else you can tell me about the 
hypothetical ancestor?” 

Emmer didn’t look like the 
genius he was — a Neanderthal 
genius, but nonetheless a real 
one. In his field, he rated very 
high. He raised a stubble-flecked 



cheek from a large thick-fingered 
paw and ran shaggy hands 
through shaggier hair. 

“I can speak with some au- 
thority,” he rumbled. “I was born 
on a world with the most exten- 
sive relics. As a child, I played 
in the ruins of their camp.” 

“I don’t question your author- 
ity,” crinkled Taphetta. “To me, 
all humans— late or early and 
male or female — look remark- 
ably alike. If you are an arch- 
eologist, that’s enough for me.” 
He paused and flicked his speech 
ribbons. “Camp, did you say?” 

E mmer smiled, unsheathing 
great teeth. “You’ve never 
seen any pictures? Impressive, 
but just a camp, monolithic one- 
story structures, and we’d give 
something to know what they’re 
made of. Presumably my world 
was one of the first they stopped 
at. They weren’t used to roughing 
it, so they built more elaborately 
than they did later on. One-story 
structures and that’s how we can 
guess at their size. The doorways 
were forty feet high.” 

“Very large,” agreed Taphetta. 
It was difficult to tell whether he 
was impressed. “What did you 
find in the ruins?” 

“Nothing,” said Emmer. “There 
were buildings there . and that was 
all, not a scrap of writing or a 
tool or a single picture. They 
covered a route estimated at 



142 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thirty thousand light-years in less 
than five thousand years — and 
not one of them died that we 
have a record of.” 

“A faster-than-light drive and 
an extremely long life,” mused 
Taphetta. “But they didn’t leave 
any information for their de- 
scendants. Why?” 

“Who knows? Their mental 
processes were certainly far dif- 
ferent from ours. They may have 
thought we’d be better off without 
it. We do know they were look- 
ing for a special kind of planet, 
like Earth, because they visited 
so many of that type, yet differ- 
ent from it because they never 
stayed. They were pretty special 
people themselves, big and long- 
lived, and maybe they couldn’t 
survive on any planet they found. 
Perhaps they had ways of de- 
termining there wasn’t the kind 
of planet they needed in the 
entire Milky Way. Their science 
,was tremendously advanced and 
when they learned that, they may 
have altered their germ plasm 
and left us, hoping that some of 
us would survive. Most of us 
did.” 

“This special planet sounds 
strange,” murmured Taphetta. 

“Not really,” said Emmer. 
“Fifty human races reached space 
travel independently and those 
who did were scattered equally 
among early and late species. It’s 
well known that individuals 



among my people are often as 
bright as any of Halden’s or 
Meredith’s, but as a whole we 
don’t have the total capacity that 
later Man does, and yet we’re 
as advanced in civilization. The 
difference? It must lie somewhere 
in the planets we live on and it’s 
hard to say just what it is.” 
“What happened to those who 
didn’t develop space travel?” 
asked Taphetta. 

“We helped them,” said Em- 
mer. 

And they had, no matter who 
or what they were, biologically 
late or early, in the depths of the 
bronze age or the threshold of 
atomic — because they were hu- 
man. That was sometimes a 
frightening thing for non-humans, 
that the race stuck together. 
They weren’t actually aggressive, 
but their total number was great 
and they held themselves aloof. 
The unknown ancestor again. 
Who else had such an origin and, 
it was tacitly assumed, such a 
destiny? 

f I1APHETTA changed his ques- 
tioning. “What do you expect 
to gain from this discovery of 
the unknown ancestor?” 

It was Halden who answered 
him. “There’s the satisfaction of 
knowing where we came from.” 
“Of course,” rustled the Rib- 
boneer. “But a lot of money 
and equipment was required for 



BIG ANCESTOR 



143 



this expedition, I can’t believe 
that the educational institutions 
that are backing you did so pure- 
ly out of intellectual curiosity.” 
“Cultural discoveries,” rum- 
bled Emmer. “How did our an- 
cestors live? When a creature is 
greatly reduced in size, as we 
are, more than physiology is 
changed — the pattern of life itself 
is altered. Things that were easy 
for them are impossible for us. 
Look at their life span.” 

“No doubt,” said Taphetta. 
“An archeologist would be inter- 
ested in cultural discoveries.” 
“Two hundred thousand years 
ago, they had an extremely ad- 
vanced civilization,” added Mai- 
den. “A faster-than-light drive, 
and we’ve achieved that Only 
within the last thousand years.” 
“But I think we have a better 
one than they did,” said the Rib- 
boneer. “There may be things we 
can learn from them in mechanics 
or physics, but wouldn’t you say 
they were better biologists than 
anything else?” 

Halden nodded. “Agreed. They 
couldn’t find a suitable planet. 
So, working directly with their 
germ plasm, they modified them- 
selves and produced us. They 
were master biologists.” 

“I thought so,” said Taphetta. 
“I never paid much attention to 
your fantastic theories before I 
signed to pilot this ship, but 
you’ve built up a convincing 



case.” He raised his head, speech 
ribbons curling fractionally and 
ceaselessly. “I don’t like to, but 
we’ll have to risk using bait for 
your pest.” 

He’d have done it anyway, but 
it was better to have the pilot’s 
consent. And there was one ques- 
tion Halden wanted to ask; it 
had been bothering him vaguely. 
“What’s the difference between 
the Ribboneer contract and the 
one we offered you? Our terms 
are more liberal.” 

“To the individual, they are, 
but it won’t matter if you dis- 
cover as much as you think you 
will. The difference is this: My 
terms don’t permit you to with- 
hold any discovery for the bene- 
fit of one race.” 

Taphetta was wrong; there had 
been no intention of withholding 
anything. Halden examined his 
own attitudes. He hadn’t intend- 
ed, but could he say that was 
true of the institutions backing 
the expedition? He couldn’t, and 
it was too late now — whatever 
knowledge they acquired would 
have to be shared. 

That was what Taphetta had 
been afraid of — there was one 
kind of technical advancement 
that multiplied unceasingly. The 
race that could improve itself 
through scientific control of its 
germ plasm had a start that could 
never be headed. The Ribboneer 
needn’t worry now.

“ Vj^HY do we have to watch 
™ it on the screen?” asked 
Meredith, glancing up. “I’d rath- 
er be in hydroponics.” 

Halden shrugged. “They may 
or may not be smarter than 
planetbound animals, but they’re 
warier. They don’t come out 
when anyone’s near.” 

Lights dimmed in the distant 
hydroponic section and the screen 
with it, until he adjusted the in- 
fra-red frequencies. He motioned 
to the two crew members, each 
with his own peculiar screen, be- 
low \^hich was a miniature key- 
board. 

“Ready?” 

When they nodded, Halden 
said : “Do as you’ve rehearsed. 
Keep noise at a minimum, but 
when you do use it, be vague. 
Don’t try to imitate them ex- 
actly.” 

At first, nothing happened on 
the big screen, and then a gray 
shape crept out. It slid through 
leaves, listened intently before 
coming forward. It jumped off 
one hydroponic section and fled 
across the open floor to the next. 
It paused, eyes glittering and an- 
tennae twitching. 

Looking around once, it leaped 
up, seizing the ledge and clawing 
up the side of the tank. Standing 
on top and rising to its haunch- 
es, it began nibbling what it could 
reach. 

Suddenly it whirled. Behind it 



and hitherto unnoticed was an- 
other shape, like it but larger. 
The newcomer inched forward. 
The small one retreated, skitter- 
ing nervously. Without warning, 
the big one leaped and the small 
one tried to flee. In a few jumps, 
the big one caught up and maul- 
ed the other unmercifully. 

It continued to bite even after 
the little one lay still. At last it 
backed off and waited, watching 
for signs of motion. There was 
none. Then it turned to the plant. 
When it had chewed off every- 
thing within reach, it climbed into 
the branches. 

The little one twitched, moved 
a leg, and cautiously began drag- 
ging itself away. It rolled off the 
raised section and surprisingly 
made no noise as it fell. It seemed 
to revive, shaking itself and scur- 
rying away, still within range of 
the screen. 

Against the wall was a small 
platform. The little one climbed 
on top and there found some- 
thing that seemed to interest it. 
It sniffed around and reached and 
felt the discovery. Wounds were 
forgotten as it snatched up the 
object and frisked back to the 
scene of its recent defeat. 

This time it had no trouble 
with the raised section. It leaped 
and landed on top and made con- 
siderable noise in doing so. The 
big animal heard and twisted 
around. It saw and clambered

down hastily, jumping the last 
few feet. Squealing, it hit the 
floor and charged. 

The small one stood still till 
the last instant — and then a paw 
flickered out and an inch-long 
knife blade plunged into the 
throat of the charging creature. 
Red spurted out as the bigger 
beast screamed. The knife flashed 
in and out until the big animal 
collapsed and stopped moving. 

The small creature removed 
the knife and wiped it on the pelt 



of its foe. Then it scampered 
back to the platform on which 
the knife had been found — and 
laid it down. 

A t Halden’s signal, the lights 
flared up and the screen be- 
came too bright for anything to 
be visible. 

“Go in and get them,” said 
Halden. “We don’t want the pests 
to find out that the bodies aren’t 
flesh.” 

“It was realistic enough,” said 




146

Meredith as the crewmen shut off 
their machines and went out. “Do 
you think it will work?” 

“It might. We had an audi- 
ence.” 

“Did we? I didn’t notice.” 
Meredith leaned back. “Were the 
puppets exactly like the pests? 
And if not, will the pests be 
fooled?” 

“The electronic puppets were a 
good imitation, but the animals 
don’t have to identify them as 
their species. If they’re smart 
enough, they’ll know the value of 
a knife, no matter who uses it.” 
“What if they’re smarter? Sup- 
pose they know a knife can’t be 
used by a creature without real 
hands?” 

“That’s part of our precau- 
tions. They’ll never know until 
they try. — and they’ll never get 
away from the trap to try.” 
“Very good. I neVer thought of 
that,” said Meredith, coming 
closer. “I like the way your prim- 
itive mind works. At times I 
actually think of marrying you.” 
“Primitive,” he said, alternate- 
ly frozen and thawed, though he 
knew that, in relation to her, he 
was not advanced. 

“It’s almost a curse, isn’t it?” 
She laughed and took the curse 
away by leaning provocatively 
against him. “But barbaric lov- 
ers are often nice.” 

Here we go again, he thought 
drearily, sliding his arm around 



her. To her, I’m merely a pas- 
sionate savage. 

They went to his cabin. 

She sat down, smiling. Was 
she pretty? Maybe. For her own 
race, she wasn’t tall, only by 
Terran standards. Her legs were 
disproportionately long and well 
shaped and her face was some- 
what bland and featureless, ex- 
cept for a thin, straight, short 
nose. It was her eyes that made 
the difference, he decided. A 
notch or two up the scale of 
visual development, her eyes were 
larger and she could see an extra 
color on the violet end of the 
spectrum. 

She settled back and looked at 
him. “It might be fun living with 
you on primeval Earth.” 

He said nothing; she knew as 
well as he that Earth was as ad- 
vanced as her own world. She had 
something else in mind. 

“I don’t think I will, though. 
We might have children.” 

“Would it be wrong?” he asked. 
“I’m as intelligent as you. We 
wouldn’t have subhuman mon- 
sters.” 

“It would be a step up — for 
you.” Under her calm, there was 
tension. It had been there as long 
as he’d known her, but it was 
closer to the surface now. “Do I 
have the right to condemn the un- 
born? Should I make them start* 
lower than I am?” 

The conflict was not new nor

confined to them. In one form or 
another, it governed personal re- 
lations between races that were 
united against non-humans, but 
held sharp distinctions them- 
selves. 

“I haven’t asked you to marry 
me,” he said bluntly. 

“Because you’re afraid I’d re- 
fuse.” 

It was true; no one asked a 
member of a higher race to enter 
a permanent union. 

“Why did you ever have any- 
thing to do with me?” demanded 
Halden. 

“Love,” she said gloomily. 
“Physical attraction. But I can’t 
let it lead me astray.” 

“Why not make a play for 
Kelburn? If you’re going to be 
scientific about it, he’d give you 
children of the higher type.” 

• “Kelburn.” It didn’t sound like 
a name, the way she said it. “I 
don’t like him and he wouldn’t 
marry me.” 

“He wouldn’t, but he’d give 
you children if you were humble 
enough. There’s a fifty per cent 
chance you might conceive.” 

S HE provocatively arched her 
back. Not even the women of 
Kelburn’s race had a body like 
hers and she knew it. 

“Racially, there should be a 
chance,” she said. “Actually, 
Kelburn and I would be infer- 
tile.” 



“Can you be sure?” he asked, 
knowing it was a poor attempt to 
act unconcerned. 

“How can anyone be sure on a 
theoretical basis?” she asked, an 
oblique smile narrowing her eyes. 
“I know we can’t.” 

His face felt anesthetized. “Did 
you have to tell me that?” 

She got up and came to him. 
She nuzzled against him and his 
reaction was purely reflexive. His 
hand swung out and he could feel 
the flesh give when his knuckles 
struck it. 

She fell back and dazedly cov- 
ered her face with her hand. 
When she took it away, blood 
spurted. She groped toward the 
mirror and stood in front of it. 
She wiped the blood off, exam- 
ining her features carefully. 

“You’ve broken my nose,” she 
said factually. “I’ll have to stop 
the blood and pain.” 

She pushed her nose back into 
place and waggled it to make 
sure. She closed her eyes and 
stood silent and motionless. Then 
she stepped back and looked at 
herself critically. 

“It’s set and partially knitted. 
I’ll concentrate tonight and have 
it healed by morning.” 

She felt in the cabinet and at- 
tached an invisible strip firmly 
across the bridge. Then she came 
over to him. 

“I wondered what you’d do. 
You didn’t disappoint me.” 



148 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He scowled miserably at her. 
Her face was almost plain and 
the bandage, invisible or not, did- 
n’t improve her appearance any. 
How could he still feel that at- 
traction to her? 

“Try Emmer,” he suggested 
tiredly. “He’ll find you irresis- 
tible, and he’s even more savage 
than I am.” 

“Is he?” She smiled enigmatic- 
ally. “Maybe, in a biological 
sense. Too much, though. You’re 
just right.” 

He sat down on the bed. Again 
there was only one way of know- 
ing what Emmer would do — and 
she knew. She had no concept 
of love outside of the physical, to 
make use of her body so as to 
gain an advantage — what advan- 
tage? — for the children she in- 
tended to have. Outside of that, 
nothing mattered, and for the 
sake of alloying the lower with 
the higher, she was as cruel to 
herself as she was to him. And 
yet he wanted her. 

“I do think I love you,” she 
said. “And if love’s enough, I 
may marry you in spite of every- 
thing. But you’ll have to watch 
out whose children I have.” She 
wriggled into his arms. 

The racial disparity was great 
and she had provoked him, but it 
was not completely her fault. 
Besides . 

Besides what? She had a beau- 
tiful body that could bear su- 



perior children — and they might 
be his. 

He twisted away. With those 
thoughts, he was as bad as she 
was. Were they all that way, 
every one of them, crawling up- 
ward out of the slime toward the 
highest goal they could conceive 
of? Climbing over — no, through — 
everybody they could coerce, se- 
duce or marry — onward and up- 
ward. He raised his hand, but it 
was against himself that his an- 
ger was turned. 

“Careful of the nose,” she said, 
pressing against him. “You’ve 
already broken it once.” 

He kissed her with sudden pas- 
sion that even he knew was pri- 
mitive. 

T here were no immediate re- 
sults from the puppet per- 
formance and so it was repeated 
at intervals. After the third time, 
Firmon reported, coming in as 
Halden pored over the meager 
biological data he’d gathered on 
the unknown ancestor. Wild 
guesses mostly, not one real fact 
in all the statistics. After two 
hundred thousand years, there 
wasn’t much left to work with. 

Firmon slouched doWn. “It 
worked,” he said. “Got three a 
few hours ago.” 

Halden looked at him; he had 
hoped it wouldn’t work. There 
was satisfaction in being right, 
but he would rather face some- 

1<(9 



BIG ANCESTOR 



thing less intelligent. Wariness 
was one thing, the shyness and 
slyness of an unseen animal, but 
intelligence was more difficult to 
predict. 

“Where are they?” he asked. 

“Did you want them?” Fir- 
mon seemed surprised at the idea. 

Halden sighed; it was his own 
fault. Firmon had a potentially 
good mind, but he hadn’t been 
trained to use it and that count- 
ed for more than people thought. 
“Any animal smart enough to 
appreciate the value of a knife 
is worth study on that account. 
That goes double when it’s a 
pest.” 

“I’ll change the cremation set- 
ting,” said Firmon. “Next time, 
we’ll just stun them.” 

The trap setting was changed 
and several animals were taken. 
Physically, they were very much 
as Halden had described them to 
Taphetta, small four-legged crea- 
tures with fleshy antennae. Dis- 
section revealed a fairly large 
brain capacity, while behavior 
tests indicated an intelligence 
somewhat below what he had as- 
sumed. Still, it was more than 
he wanted a pest to have, espe- 
cially since it also had hands. 

The biological mechanism of 
the hands was simple. It walked 
on the back of the front paws, on 
the fingers of which were fleshy 
pads. When it sat upright, as it 
often did, the flexibility of the 

iSo 



wrists permitted the forepaws to 
be used as hands. Clumsy, but 
because it had a thumb, it could 
handle such tools as a knife. 

He had made an error there. 
He had guessed the intelligence, 
but he hadn’t known it could use 
the weapon he had put within 
reach. A tiny thing with an inch- 
long knife was not much more 
dangerous than the animal alone, 
but he didn’t like the idea of it 
loose on the ship. 

The metal knife would have to 
be replaced with something else. 
Technicians could compound a 
plastic that would take a keen 
edge for a while and deteriorate 
to a soft mass in a matter of 
weeks. Meanwhile, he had actual- 
ly given the animal a dangerous 
weapon — the concept df a tool. 
There was only one way to take 
that away from them, by exter- 
mination. But that would have 
to wait. 

Fortunately, the creature had 
a short life and a shorter breed- 
ing period. The actual replace- 
ment rate was almost neglible. 
In attaining intelligence, it had 
been short-changed in fertility 
and, as a consequence, only in 
the specialized environment of 
this particular ship was it any 
menace at all. 

They were lucky; a slightly 
higher fertility and the thing 
could threaten their existence. As 
it was, the ship would have to be 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



deverminized before it could land 
on an inhabited planet. 

Halden took the data to the 
Ribboneer pilot and, after some 
discussion, it was agreed that the 
plastic knife should supplant the 
metal one. It was also decided to 
allow a few to escape with the 
weapon; there had to be some in- 
centive if the creature was to 
visit the trap more than a few 
times. Besides, with weapons 
there was always the chance of 
warfare between different groups. 
They might even exterminate 
each other. 

Gradually, over a period of 
weeks, the damage to hydropo- 
nics subsided; the pests were un- 
der control. There was nothing to 
worry about unless they mutat- 
ed again, which was unlikely. 

l^ELBURN scowled at the 
pilot. “Where are we now?” 
he challenged, his face creased 
with suspicion. 

“You have access to all the in- 
struments, so you should know,” 
said Taphetta. He was crouching 
and seemed about to spring, but 
he was merely breathing relaxed- 
ly through a million air tubes. 

“I do know. My calculations 
show one star as the most prob- 
able. We should have reached it 
two days ago — and we’re nowhere 
near it.” 

“True,” admitted Taphetta. 
“We’re heading toward what you 



would consider the fifth or sixth 
most likely star.” 

Kelburn caught the implica- 
tion. They all did. “Then you 
know where it is?” he asked, sus- 
picion vanishing. 

“Not in the sense you’re ask- 
ing — no, I’m not sure it’s what 
you’re looking for. But there was 
once a great civilization there.” 

“You knew this and didn’t tell 
us?” 

“Why should I?” Taphetta 
looked at him in mild astonish- 
ment. “Before you hired me, I 
wouldn’t tell you for obvious 
reasons. And afterward — well, 
you engaged all my skill and 
knowledge and I used them to 
bring you here by the shortest 
route. I didn’t think it necessary 
to tell you until we actually ar- 
rived. Is that wrong?” 

It wasn’t wrong; it merely il- 
lustrated the difference in the 
way an alien mind worked. 
Sooner or later, they would have . 
found the place, but he had sav- 
ed them months. 

“What’s it like?” Emmer asked. 

Taphetta jiggled his ribbons. 
“I don’t know. I was passing 
near here and saw the planet off 
to one side.” 

“And you didn’t stop?” Em- 
mer was incredulous. 

“Why should I? We’re great 
navigators because we do so 
much of it. We would never get 
very far if we stopped to examine 



BIG ANCESTOR 



151 



everything that looks interesting. 
Besides, it’s not a good policy in 
a strange region, especially with 
an unarmed ship.” 

They wouldn’t have that prob- 
lem. The ship was armed well 
enough to keep off uncivilized 
marauders who had very recent- 
ly reached the spaceship age, and 
only such people were apt to be 
inhospitable. 

“When will we land?” asked 
Halden. 

“In a few hours, but you can 
see the planet on our screens.” 
Taphetta extended a head ribbon 
toward a knob and a planet came 
into view. 

There weren’t two civilizations 
in the Milky Way that built on 
such a large scale, even from the 
distance that they could see it. 
Great, distinctive cities were 
everywhere. There was no ques- 
tion as to what they had found. 

“Now you’ll learn why they 
ran away,” said Taphetta. 

“A new theory,” Kelburn said, 
though it wasn’t, for they had 
left. “What makes you think they 
were afraid?” 

“No air. If your calculations 
are right, there must have been 
an extensive atmosphere a few 
hundred thousand years ago and 
now there isn’t any. A planet this 
size doesn’t lose air that fast. 
Therefore, it’s an artificial con- 
dition. Who takes the trouble to 
leave a planet uninhabitable ex- 



cept someone who’s afraid others 
will use it — and who else runs 
away?” 

“They may have done it to 
preserve what they left,” suggest- 
ed Halden. 

“Perhaps,” said Taphetta, but 
it was obvious he didn’t think so. 

T he lack of air had one thing 
to recommend it — they 
needn’t worry about their pests 
escaping. The disadvantage was 
that they had to wear spacesuits. 
They landed on top of a great 
building that was intact after 
thousands of years and still strong 
enough to support the added 
weight. And then — 

Then there was nothing. 
Buildings, an enormous num- 
ber and variety of them, huge, not 
one of them less than five stories 
high, all with ramps instead of 
stairs. This was to be expected, 
considering the great size of the 
people who had lived there, and 
it followed the familiar pattern. 

But there was nothing in those 
buildings! On this airless world, 
there was no decay, no rust or 
corrosion — and nothing io decay 
or corrode. No pictures, tools, 
nothing that resembled sculpture, 
and while there were places where 
machines had stood, none were 
there now. Here and there in 
inaccessible locations were fea- 
turedless blobs of metal. The 
implication was clear; Where

they hadn’t been able to remove a 
machine, they had melted in 
down on the spot. 

The thoroughness was bewild- 
ering. It wasn’t done by some 
enemy; he would have stood off 
and razed the cities. But there 
was no rubble and the buildings 
were empty. The inhabitants 
themselves had removed all that 
was worth taking along. 

A whole' people had packed 
and moved away, leaving behind 
only massive, echoing structures. 

There was plenty to learn, but 
nothing to learn it from. Build- 
ings can indicate only so much 
and then there must be some- 
thing else — at least some of the 
complex artifacts of a civiliza- 
tion — and there was none. Out- 
side the cities, on the plains, 
there were the remains of plants 
and animals that indicated by 
their condition that airlessness 
had come suddenly. Sam Halden, 
the biologist, had examined them, 
but he discovered no clues. The 
unknown ancestor was still a 
mystery. 

And the others — Emmer, the 
archeologist, and Meredith, the 
linguist — had nothing to work 
on, though they searched. It was 
Kelburn who found the first hint. 
Having no specific task, now that 
the planet was located, he wan- 
dered around in a scout ship. On 
the other side of the planet, he 
signaled that there was a ma- 



chine and that it was intact! 

The crew was hurriedly recall- 
ed, the equipment brought back 
into the ship, and they took off 
for the plain where Kelburn 
waited. 

And there was the machine, im- 
mense, like everything on the 
planet. It stood alone, tapering 
toward the sky. At the base was 
a door, which, when open, was 
big enough to permit a spaceship 
to enter easily — only it was clos- 
ed. 

Kelburn stood beside the tow- 
ering entrance, a tiny figure in 
a spacesuit. He gazed up at it 
as the three came near. “All we 
have to do is open it,’’ he said. 

“How?’’ asked Meredith. She 
seemed to have forgotten that 
she disliked him. He had made 
a chance discovery because he 
had nothing to do while the 
others were busy, but she re- 
garded it as further proof of his 
superiority. 

TT was hard to watch the hap- 
piness that her face directed 
toward Kelburn. Halden turned 
away. 

“Just press the button,’’ he 
said. 

Emrner noticed his expression. 
“It’s such a big button,’’ he ob- 
jected. “It’s going to be hard 
to know when we find it.” 

“There’s an inscription of some 
sort,” said Kelburn loftily. “This 



154 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thing was left for a purpose. 
Somewhere there must be operat- 
ing instructions.” 

“From here, it looks like a 
complex wave-form,” a voice 
crinkled in their radio — Taphetta 
from the spaceship. “All we have 
to do is to find the right base in 
the electromagnetic spectrum and 
duplicate it on a beam broadcast 
and the door should open. You’re 
too close to see it as clearly as 
I can.” 

P erhaps they were too close 
to the big ancestor, decid- 
ed Halden moodily as they went 
back. It had overshadowed much 
of their thinking, and who really 
knew what the ancestor was like 
and what had motivated him? 

But the Ribboneer was right 
about the signal, though it took 
several days to locate it. And 
then the huge door swung open 
and air whistled out. 

Inside was another disappoint- 
ment, a bare hall with a ramp 
leading upward, closed off at the 
ceiling. They could have forced 
through, but they had no desire 
to risk using a torch to penetrate 
the barrier — in view of the num- 
ber of precautions they’d already 
encountered, it was logical to as- 
sume that there were more wait- 
ing for them. 

It was Emmer who found the 
solution. “In appearance, it re- 
sembles a spaceship. Let’s assume 



it is, minus engines. It was never 
intended to fly. Listen. 

“There’s no air, so you can’t 
hear,” said Emmer impatiently. 
“But you could if there were air. 
Put your hands against the wall.” 

A distinct vibration ran 
through the whole structure. It 
hadn’t been there before the door 
opened. Some mechanism had 
been triggered. The rumbling 
went on, came to a stop, and be- 
gan again. Was it some kind of 
communicatiqn? 

Hastily rigged machines were 
haqled inside the chamber to gen- 
erate an air supply so that sounds 
would be produced fpr the re- 
corders. Translating equipment 
was set up and focused and, after 
some experimentation with sig- 
nals, the door was slowly closed. 
No one remained inside; there 
was no guarantee that it would 
be as easy to get out as it had 
been to get in. 

They waited a day and a half 
while the sounds were being re- 
corded. The delay seemed end- 
less. The happiest of the crew 
was Kelburn. Biologically the 
highest human on the expedition, 
he was stimulated. He wandered 
aimlessly and smiled affably, pat- 
ting Meredith, when he came to 
her, in the friendliest fashion. 
Startled, she smiled back and 
looked around wanly. Halden 
was behind her. 

If I had not been there, thought 



BIG ANCESTOR 



155 



Halden — and thereafter made it 
a point to be there. 

M eredith was excited, but 
not precisely happy. The 
work was out of her hands until 
the translating equipment was re- 
trieved. As the second highest 
biological type, she, too, was af- 
fected, until she pointedly went 
to her room and locked it from 
the inside. 

Halden kept himself awake 
with anti-fatigue pills, in part 
because Meredith could change 
her mind about Kelburn, and be- 
cause of that locked door. 

Emmer tried to be phlegmatic 
and seemed to succeed. Taphetta 
alone was unconcerned; to him, it 
was an interesting and perhaps 
profitable discovery, but impor- 
tant only because of that. He 
would not be changed at all by 
whatever he learned. 

Hours crawled by and at last 
the door opened; the air came 
rushing out again. The translat- 
ing equipment was brought back 
to the ship and Meredith was left 
alone with it. 

It was half a day before she 
admitted the others to the lab- 
oratory. 

“The machine is still working,” 
she said. “There seems to have 
been some attempt to make the 
message hard to decode. But the 
methods they used were exactly 
the clues that the machine need- 



ed to decipher it. My function as 
a linguist was to help out with 
the interpretation of key words 
and phrases. I haven’t got even 
a little part of the message. You’ll 
know what it is as soon as I do. 
After the first part, the translator 
didn’t seem to have much 
trouble.” 

They sat down facing it — 
Taphetta, Kelburn, Meredith, 
Halden and Emmer. Meredith 
was midway between Kelburn 
and himself. Was there any sig- 
nificance in that, wondered Hal- 
den, or was he reading more in 
her behavior than was actually 
there? 

“The translation is complete,” 
announced the machine. 

“Go ahead,” Meredith order- 
ed. 

“The words will be speeded up 
to human tempo,” said the trans- 
lator. “Insofar as possible, speech 
mannerisms of the original will 
be imitated. Please remember 
that it is only an imitation, how- 
ever.” 

The translator coughed, stut- 
tered and began. “We have pur- 
posely made access to our records 
difficult. If you can translate this 
message, you’ll find, at the end, 
instructions for reaching the rest 
of our culture relics. As an ad- 
vanced race, you’re welcome to 
them. We’ve provided a surprise 
for anyone else. 

“For ourselves, there’s nothing 



156 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



left but an orderly retreat to a 
place where we can expect to 
live in peace. That means leav- 
ing this Galaxy, but because of 
our life span, we’re capable of 
it and we won’t be followed.” 

Taphetta crinkled his ribbons 
in amusement. Kelburn frowned 
at the interruption, but no one 
else paid any attention. 

The translator went on. “Our 
metabolic rate is the lowest of 
any creature we know of. We live 
several thousand revolutions of 
any recorded planet and our rate 
of increase is extremely low; un- 
der the most favorable circum- 
stances, we can do no more than 
double our numbers in two hun- 
dred generations.” 

“This doesn’t sound as if they 
were masters of biological sci- 
ence,” rustled Taphetta. 

TTALDEN stirred uneasily. It 
wasn’t turning out at all the 
way he had expected. 

“At the time we left,” the 
message continued, “we found 
no other intelligent race, though 
there were some capable of fur- 
ther evolution. Perhaps our scout 
ships long ago met your ancestors 
on some remote planet. We were 
never very numerous, and be- 
cause we move and multiply so 
slowly, we are in danger of be- 
ing swept out of existence in the 
foreseeable future. We prefer to 
leave while we can. The reason 



we must go developed on our own 
planet, deep beneath the cities, 
in the underworks, which we had 
ceased to inspect because there 
was no need to. This part was 
built to last a million genera- 
tions, which is long even for us.” 
Emmer sat upright, annoyed 
at himself. “Of course! There 
are always sewers and I didn’t 
think of looking there!” 

“In the last several genera- 
tions, we sent out four expedi- 
tions, leisurely trips because we 
then thought we had time to ex- 
plore thoroughly. With this 
planet as base of operations, the 
successive expeditions fanned out 
in four directions, to cover the 
most representative territory.” 
Kelburn stiffened, mingled 
pride and chagrin on his face. 
His math had been correct, as 
far as he had figured it. But had 
there been any reason to assume 
that they would confine their ex- 
ploration to one direction? No, 
they would want to cover the 
whole Milky Way. 

Taphetta paled. Four times as 
many humans to contend with! 
He hadn’t met the other three- 
fourths yet — and, for him, it was- 
n’t at all a pleasant thought. 

“After long preparation, we 
sent several ships to settle one of 
the nearer planets that we’d se- 
lected on the first expedition. To 
our dismay, we found that the 
plague was there — ^though it had- 



BIG ANCESTOR 



157 



n’t been on our first visit!” 
Halden frowned. They were 
proving themselves less and less 
expert biologists. And this plague 
there had to be a reason to 
leave, and sickness was as good 
as any — but unless he was mis- 
taken, plague wasn’t used in the 
strict semantic sense. It might be 
the fault of the translation. 

“The colonists refused to set- 
tle: they came back at once and 
reported. We sent out our fastest 
ships, heavily armed. We didn’t 
have the time to retrace our path 
completely, for we’d stopped at 
innumerable places. What we did 
was to check a few planets, the 
outward and return parts of all 
four voyages. In every place, the 
plague was there, too, and we 
knew that we were responsible. 

“We did what we could. Ex- 
hausting our nuclear armament, 
we obliterated the nearest plan- 
ets on each of the four spans of 
our journeys.” 

“I wondered why the route 
came to an end,” crinkled Ta- 
phetta, but- there was no com- 
ment, no answer. 

“We reconstructed what had 
happened. For a long time, the 
plague had lived in our sewers, 
subsisting on wastes. At night, 
because they are tiny and move 
exceedingly fast, they were able 
to make their way into our ships 
and were aboard on every jour- 
ney. We knew they were there. 



but because they were so small, 
it was difficult to dislodge them 
from their nesting places. And so 
we tolerated their existence.” 

“^^HEY weren’t so smart,” said 
Taphetta. “We figured out 
that angle long ago. True, our 
ship is an exception, but we hav- 
n’t landed anywhere, and won’t 
until we deverminize it.” 

“We didn’t guess that next to 
the hull in outer space and con- 
sequently exposed to hard radia- 
tion,” the message went on, 
“those tiny creatures would mu- 
tate dangerously and escape to 
populate the planets we landed 
on. They had always been loath- 
some little beasts that walked in- 
stead of rolling or creeping, but 
now they became even more vi- 
cious, spawning explosively and 
fighting with the same incessant 
violence. They had always har- 
bored diseases which spread to 
us, but now they’ve become ^lot- 
houses for still smaller parasites 
that also are able to infect us. 
Finally, we are now allergic to 
them, and when they are within 
miles of us, it is agony to roll or 
creep.” 

Taphetta looked around. “Who 
would have thought it? You were 
completely mistaken as to your 
origin.” Kelburn was staring va- 
cantly ahead, but didn’t see a 
thing. Meredith was leaning 
against Halden; her eyes were 



158 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



closed. “The woman has finally 
chosen, now that she knows she 
was once vermin,” clicked the 
Ribboneer. “But there are tears 
in her eyes.” 

“The intelligence of the beast 
has advanced slightly, though 
there isn’t much difference be- 
tween the highest and the low- 
est — and we’ve checked both 
ends of all four journeys. But 
before, it was relatively calm and 
orderly. Now it is malignantly 
insane.” 

Taphetta rattled his - ribbons. 
“Turn it off. You don’t have to 
listen to this. We all are of some 
origin or other and it wasn’t 
necessarily pretty. This being 
was a slug of some kind — and 
are you now what it describes? 
Perhaps mentally a little, out of 
pride, but the pride was false.” 

“We can’t demolish all the 
planets we unthinkingly let it 
loose on; there are too many and 
it lives too fast. The stars drift 
and we would lose some, and 
before we could eliminate the 
last one, it would develop space 
travel — it has little intelligence, 
but it could get that far — and it 
would escape ahead of us. We 
know an impossible task when we 
see it. And so we’re leaving, first 
making sure that this animal will 



never make use of the products 
of our civilization. It may reach 
this planet, but it will not be 
able to untangle our code — it’s 
too stupid. You who will have 
to face it, please forgive us. It’s 
the only thing that we’re asham- 
ed of.” 

“Don’t listen,” said the Rib- 
boneer and, bending his broad, 
thin body, he sprang to the trans- 
lator, shook it and banged with 
his ribbons until the machine was 
silent. “You don’t have to tell 
anyone,” crackled Taphetta. 
“Don’t worry about me — f won’t 
repeat it.” He looked around at 
the faces. “But I can see that you 
will report to everyone exactly 
what you found. That pride 
you’ve developed — you’ll need 
it.” 

Taphetta sat on top of the ma- 
chine, looking like nothing so 
much as a huge fancy bow on a 
gift-wrapped package. 

They noted the resemblance 
vaguely. But each of them knew 
that, as a member of the most 
numerous race in the Milky Way, 
no longer feared for their mys- 
terious qualities — despised, in- 
stead — wherever they went, 
there would never be any gifts 
for them — for any man.
