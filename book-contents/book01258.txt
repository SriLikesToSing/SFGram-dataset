A proposal made to the United 
Nations by the United States not 
so long ago is the subject of an 
article that appears in this issue 
and which could very easily de- 
velop into a u hot potato”. Whether 
it does or not, the facts are worth 
sober consideration. The title of 
it is WHY GUIDED MISSILES 
CAN NOT BE CONTROLLED, 
written by a man who is well known 
in his field and knows whereof he 
speaks — but who shall have to re- 
main anonymous as far as what 
he says here is concerned. The pro- 
posal referred to is of a “propa- 
gandistic” type which, to any in- 
telligent person, is so faulty that it 
borders on folly — and perhaps is. 
If it ever comes to a vote and is 
adopted, with Russia gleefully ac- 
cepting, which it would, we could 
kiss farewell any peace of mind 
we ever had as individuals or as a 
nation. The author, whom we 
shall call “Y”, is an authority of 
long experience on his subject and 
he tells us exactly the provable rea- 


sons why this paper still before the 
United Nations (at this writing) 
should never be allowed to become 
a reality. 

The singing telegram might have 
started it all. Perhaps it did. But 
just before television came into 
prominence, our radios started vi- 
brating with singing commercials. 
When television blossomed, adver- 
tising became show business in a 
big way. And because of well- 
heeled sponsors we can enjoy some 
fine entertainment. Today, the 
novelty of television has worn off 
and audiences are becoming dis- 
criminatory, turning off the poorer 
programs. However, television ad- 
vertising does sell products and in 
the future we will have better and 
better programs. But the fly in the 
ointment is this: will the commer- 
cials ever reach a degree of sane- 
ness and palatability. Some are 
unique and perhaps catchy, but 
others are downright nauseating 
and have the effect of making the 
viewer swear off for life the prod- 
uct it advertises. I think the read- 
ers of IF will have to admit that 
it is rather disconcerting to hear 
the functions of Burple’s Bile Cor- 
recting Capsules set to the tune of 
“Jeannie with the Light Brown 
Hair” or to hear a few bars of 
Mozart, Brahms or Beethoven goo- 
ed up with somebody’s infantile 
prattle about the merits of an a- 
mazing discovery containing X- 
31785, a magic new ingredient, that 
miraculously removes old prune pits 
from the grease trap of your kitch- 
en plumbing. And maybe you 
can think of some even more ab- 


2 





surd. Anyway, what this is pre- 
amble to is this: Lloyd Biggie, Jr., 
who did such a delightful job with 
the super salesmen of tomorrow in 
On The Dotted Line (June IF), 
has now turned his satire dripping 
pen (or typewriter keys, if you will) 
to the subject of the advertising 
song writers of tomorrow. Whether 
The Tunesmith is a threat or a 
promise of what will happen when 
people tune in their radios or tele- 
visions a hundred years from now 
is something we’ll let you decide. 

Three years ago, we ran a national 
collegiate science fiction contest 
offering $2000 in prizes for the 
best novelettes, written by college 
students, depicting life in America 
100 years from now. Of the win- 
ners, only Leo Kelley, who placed 
third, has written a story since then 
that we have accepted. It ran in 
the June issue and the title was The 
Human Element. It was about a 
circus clown — and oddly enough, 
the marionette which helped pay 
his way through Wilkes College 
was a circus clown named 
“Candy”, star of a local television 
program. Now 28 years old, he is 
a native of Kingston, Pennsylvania, 
which is quite all right, because 
our beef is with — mail addressed to 
us (N. Y.) that goes to Kingston, 
New Jersey ... If you are one who 
thinks science fiction has to be 
gimmicked with time or gadgets 
(and we hope not) read The 
Bridge , by G. G. Revelle, who has 
given us a dramatic science fiction 
situation that can happen this after- 
noon or wake you up tomorrow 
morning . * 


It has now been definitely estab- 
lished that the satellite, to be 
launched sometime during the In- 
ternational Geophysical Year by the 
United States, will be a three-stage 
rocket. The globule is still there, 
but when the ultimate satellite is 
finally designed and launched, refer 
to your copies of the June and Aug- 
ust ( 1956) issues of IF and see how 
accurate were James M. Nuding 
and Paul Vanous in their proposal! 
. In a letter from Aron M. 
Mathieu, editor of the Writers 1957 
Yearbook, I was asked this ques- 
tion: “Do you think well- written, 
hot, spicy sex, when actually part 
of an sf story converts more 
people into sf readers?” I replied 
that we look on sex entirely from 
the viewpoint that it must have 
something to do with the story and 
must be handled in good taste; 
that as the main theme of a story, 
or as an ingredient, we have not 
found that it converts people into 
science fiction readers. So, the 
editorial attitude toward sex a- 
round here is simply that of how 
it’s handled. Whether you are “fer” 
it or “agin” it, here’s one way of 
treating sex which we found rather 
refreshing: it’s called The Birds 
and the Bees , by Dave Fisher, a 
newcomer to the pages of IF. Sex 
is not a part of his story, nor is it 
an ingredient — it is the whole dog- 
goned story! 

Letters inquiring about a Second 
World of IF have begun to arrive. 
Readers want to know: When? 
Will it contain novelettes only, a 
mixture — or what? Well, what 
would you like? — jlq

BY LLOYD B1GGLE, JR. 


He was a real atomic tunesmith, the boy with the go. 
A throwback who knew more music than any man alive. 
That made him dangerous . too dangerous to live. 


E VERYONE GALLS it the Center. It has another name, 
a long one, that gets listed in government appropria- 
tions and can be looked up in the encyclopedia, but no one 
uses it. From Bombay to Lima, it is — the Center. You can 
stagger out of the rolling mists of Venus, elbow your way 
up to a bar, and begin, “When I was at the Center . 
And every stranger within hearing will listen attentively. 
You can mention the Center in the depths of London, or 
on a Martian desert, or at the solitary outpost on Pluto, and 
know you are understood. 

No one ever explains the Center. It isn’t possible, and it 
isn’t necessary. From the babe in arms to the centenarian 
looking forward to redrement, everyone has been there, 



and plans to go again next year, 
and the year after that. It is the va- 
cation land of the Solar System. It 
is square miles of undulating Amer- 
ican middle-west farm land, trans- 
figured by ingenious planning and 
relentless labor and incredible ex- 
pense. It is a monumental summary 
of man’s cultural achievements, and 
like a phoenix, it has emerged sud- 
denly, inexplicably, at the end of 
the twenty-fourth century, from the 
corroded ashes of a shocking cul- 
tural decay. 

The Center is colossal, spectacu- 
lar and magnificent. It is inspiring, 
edifying and amazing. It is awe- 
some, it is overpowering, it is — 
everything. 

And though few of its visitors 
know about this, or care, it is also 
haunted. 

You are standing in the observa- 
tion gallery of the towering Bach 
Monument. Off to the left, on the 
slope of a hill, you see the tense 
spectators who crowd the Grecian 
Theatre for Aristophanes. Sunlight 
plays on their brightly-colored 
clothing. They watch eagerly, de- 
lighted to see in person what mil- 
lions are watching on visiscope. 

Beyond the theatre, the tree- 
lined Frank Lloyd Wright Boule- 
vard curves off into the distance, 
past the Dante Monument and the 
Michelangelo Institute. The twin 
towers of a facsimile of the 
Rheims Cathedral rise above the 
horizon. Directly below, you see the 
curious landscaping of an eight- 
eenth century French jar din, and 
nearby, the Moliere Theatre. 

A hand clutches your sleeve, and 

6 


you turn suddenly, irritably, and 
find yourself face to face with an 
old man. 

The leathery face is scarred and 
wrinkled, the thin strands of hair 
glistening white. The hand on your 
arm is a gnarled claw. You stare, 
take in the slumping contortion of 
one crippled shoulder and the hide- 
ous scar of a missing ear, and back 
away in alarm. 

The sunken eyes follow you. The 
hand extends in a sweeping gesture 
that takes in the far horizon, and 
you notice that the fingers are 
maimed or missing. The voice is a 
harsh cackle. “Like it?” he says, 
and eyes you expectantly. 

Startled, you say, “Why, yes. Of 
course.” 

He takes a step forward, and his 
eyes are eager, pleading. “I say, do 
you like it?” 

In your perplexity, you can do 
no more than nod as you turn to 
hurry away. But your nod brings a 
strange response. A strident laugh, 
an innocent, childish smile of pleas- 
ure, a triumphant shout. “I did it! 
I did it all!” 

Or you stand in resplendent 
Plato Avenue, between the Wag- 
nerian Theatre, where the complete 
Der Ring des Nibelungen is per- 
formed daily without interruptions, 
and the reconstruction of the six- 
teenth century Globe Theatre, 
where Shakespearean Drama is 
present morning, afternoon and 
evening. 

A hand paws at you. “Like it?” 

If you respond with a torrent of 
ecstatic praise, the old man eyes 
you impatiently, and only waits un- 
til you have finished to ask again, 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



“I say, do you like it?” 

But a smile and a nod is met 
with beaming pride, a gesture, a 
shout “I did it!” 

In the lobby of one of the thou- 
sand spacious hotels, in the waiting 
room of the remarkable library 
where a copy of any book you re- 
quest is reproduced for you free of 
charge, in the eleventh balcony of 
Beethoven Hall, a ghost shuffles 
haltingly, clutches an arm, asks a 
question. 

And shouts proudly, “I did it!” 

E RLIN BAQUE sensed her pres- 
ence behind him, but he did 
not turn. He leaned forward, his 
left hand tearing a rumbling bass 
figure from the multichord while 
his right hand fingered a solemn 
melody. With a lightning flip of his 
hand he touched a button, and the 
thin treble tones were suddenly 
fuller, more resonant, almost clari- 
net-like. (“But God, how unlike a 
clarinet!” he thought.) 

“Must we go through all that 
again, Val?” he said. 

“The landlord was here this 
morning.” 

He hesitated, touched a button, 
touched several buttons, and wove 
weird harmonies out of the boom- 
ing tones of a brass choir. (But 
what a feeble, distorted brass 
choir!) 

“How long does he give us this 
time?” 

“Two days. And the food syn- 
thesizer’s broken down again.” 
“Good. Run down and buy some 
fresh meat.” 

“With what?” 

THE TUNESMITH 


. He slammed his fists down on the 
keyboard, and shouted above the 
shattering dissonance. “I will not 
rent a harmonizer. I will not turn 
my arranging over to hacks. If a 
Com goes out with my name on it, 
it’s going to be composed . It may 
be idiotic, and it may be sickening, 
but it’s going to be done right. It 
isn’t much, God knows, but it’s all 
I have left.” 

He turned slowly and glared at 
her, this pale, drooping, worn-out 
woman who had been his wife for 
twenty-five years. Then he looked 
away, telling himself stubbornly 
that he was no more to be blamed 
than she. When sponsors paid the 
same rates for good Corns that they 
paid for hackwork . 

“Is Hulsey coming today?” she 
asked. 

“He told me he was coming.” 

“If we could get some money for 
the landlord . .” 

“And the food synthesizer. And a 
new visiscope. And new clothes. 
There’s a limit to what can be 
done with one Com.” 

He heard her move away, heard 
the door open, and waited. It did 
not close. “Walter- Walter called,” 
she said. “You’re the featured tune- 
smith on today’s Show Case.” 

“So? There’s no money in that.” 
“I thought you wouldn’t want to 
watch, so I told Mrs. Rennik I’d 
watch with her.” 

“Sure. Go ahead. Have fun.” 
The door closed. 

Baque got to his feet, and stood 
looking down at his chaos-strewn 
worktable. Music paper, Com-lyric 
releases, pencils, sketches, half-fin- 
ished manuscripts were cluttered 

7 



together in untidy heaps and over- 
flowed onto the floor. Baque cleared 
a comer for himself and sat down 
wearily, stretching his long legs out 
under the table. 

“Damn Hulsey,” he muttered. 
“Damn sponsors. Damn visiscope. 
Damn Corns.” 

Compose something. You’re not 
a hack, like the other tunesmiths. 
You don’t punch your melodies out 
on a harmonizer’s keyboard and let 
a machine harmonize them for you. 
You’re a musician, not a melody 
monger. Write some music. Write a 
— a sonata, for multichord. Take 
the time now, and compose some- 
thing. 

His eyes fell on the first lines of a 
Com-lyric release. “If your flyer 
jerks and clowns, if it has its ups 
and downs . .” 

“Damn landlords,” he muttered, 
reaching for a pencil. 

The tiny wall clock tinkled the 
hour, and Baque leaned over to 
turn on the visiscope. A cherub- 
faced master of ceremonies smiled 
out at him ingratiatingly. “Waiter- 
Waiter again, ladies and gentlemen. 
It’s Com time on today’s Show 
Case. Thirty minutes of Com- 
mercials by one of today’s most tal- 
ented tunesmiths. Our Com spot- 
light is on — ” 

A noisy brass fanfare rang out, 
the tainted brass tones of a multi- 
chord. 

“Erlin Baque!” 

The multichord swung into an 
odd, dipsey melody Baque had done 
five years before, for Tamper 
Cheese, and a scattering of ap- 
plause sounded in the background. 
A nasal soprano voice mouthed the 

8 


words, and Baque groaned unhap- 
pily. “We age our cheese, and age 
it, age it, age it, the old-fashioned 
way . .” 

Walter- Walter cavorted about 
the stage, moving in time with the 
melody, darting down into the audi- 
ence to kiss some sedate housewife- 
on-a-holiday, and beaming at the 
howls of laughter. 

The multichord sounded another 
fanfare, and Walter- Walter leaped 
back onto the stage, both arms ex- 
tended over his head. “Now listen 
to this, all you beautiful people. 
Here’s your Walter- Walter exclu- 
sive on Erlin Baque.” He glanced 
secretively over his shoulder, tip- 
toed a few steps closer to the audi- 
ence, placed his finger on his lips, 
and then called out loudly, “Once 
upon a time there was another 
composer named Baque, spelled 
B-A-C-H, but pronounced Baque. 
He was a real atomic propelled 
tunesmith, the boy with the go, ac- 
cording to them that know. He 
lived some four or five or six hun- 
dred years ago, so we can’t exactly 
say that that Baque and our Baque 
were Baque to Baque. But we don’t 
have to go Baque to hear Baque. 
We like the Baque we’ve got. Are 
you with me?” 

Cheers. Applause. Baque turned 
away, hands trembling, a choking 
disgust nauseating him. 

“We start off our Corns by Baque 
with that little masterpiece Baque 
did for Foam Soap. Art work by 
Bruce Combs. Stop, look — and lis- 
ten!” 

Baque managed to turn off the 
visiscope just as the first bar of soap 
jet propelled itself across the screen. 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



He picked up the Com lyric again, 
and his mind began to shape the 
thread of a melody. 

“If your flyer jerks and clowns, 
if it has its ups and downs, ups and 
downs, ups and downs, you need a 
WARING!” 

He hummed softly to himself, 
sketching a musical line that 
swooped and jerked like an erratic 
flyer. Word painting, it was called, 
back when words and tones meant 
something. Back when the B-A-C-H 
Baque was underscoring such gran- 
diose concepts as heaven and hell. 

Baque worked slowly, now and 
then checking a harmonic progres- 
sion at the multichord and reject- 
ing it, straining his mind for some 
fluttering accompaniment pattern 
that would simulate the sound of a 
flyer. But then — no. The Waring 
people wouldn’t like that. They ad- 
vertised that their flyers were noise- 
less. 

He was suddenly aware of ur- 
gently-sounding door chimes. He 
walked over to flip on the scanner, 
and Hulsey’s pudgy face grinned 
out at him. 

“Come on up,” Baque told him. 
Hulsey nodded, and disappeared. 

Five minutes later he waddled 
through the door, sank into a chair 
that sagged dangerously under his 
bulky figure, plunked his briefcase 
on the floor, and mopped his face. 
“Whew ! Wish you’d get yourself on 
a lower level. Or into a building 
with some modern conveniences. 
Those elevators scare me to death!” 

“I’m thinking of moving,” Baque 
said. 

“Good. It’s about time.” 

“But it’ll probably be somewhere 

THE TUNESMITH 


higher up. The landlord has given 
me two days’ notice.” 

Hulsey winced, and shook his 
head sadly. “I see. Well, I won’t 
keep you in suspense, then. Here’s 
the check for the Sana-Soap Com.” 
Baque took the check, glanced at 
it, and scowled. 

“You were behind in your guild 
dues,” Hulsey said. “Have to de- 
duct them, you know.” 

“Yes. I’d forgotten.” 

“I like to do business with Sana- 
Soap. Cash right on the line. Too 
many companies wait until the end 
of the month. Sana-Soap wants a 
couple of changes, but they paid 
anyway.” He snapped open the 
briefcase, and pulled out a folder. 
“You’ve got some sly bits in this, 
Erlin my boy. They like it. Par- 
ticularly this ‘sudsey, sudsey, sudsey’ 
thing in the bass. They kicked on 
the number of singers, at first, but 
not after they heard it. Now right 
here they want a break for a 
straight announcement.” 

Baque glanced, and nodded. 
“How about keeping the ‘sudsey, 
sudsey’ ostinato going as a back- 
ground to the announcement?” 
“Sounds good. That’s a sly bit, 
that — what’d you call it?” 
“Ostinato.” 

“Ah — yes. Wonder why the other 
tunesmiths don’t work in bits like 
that.” 

“A harmonizer doesn’t produce 
effects,” Baque said dryly. “It just 
— harmonizes.” 

“You give them about thirty sec- 
onds of that ‘sudsey’ for back- 
ground. They can cut it if they 
don’t like it.” 

Baque nodded, and scribbled a 


9 



note on the manuscript. 

“And the arrangement,” Hulsey 
weht on. “Sorry, Erlin, but we can’t 
get a French horn player. You’ll 
have to do something else with that 
part.” 

“No horn player? What’s wrong 
with Rankin?” 

“Blacklisted. The Performers’ 
Guild has him blacklisted. He went 
out to the west coast to play. Played 
for nothing, and even paid his own 
expenses, so they blacklisted him.” 

“I remember,” Baque said soft- 
ly. “The Monuments of Art So- 
ciety. He played a Mozart Horn 
Concerto for them. Their last con- 
cert, too. Wish I could have heard 
it, even if it Was with multichord.” 

“He can play it all he wants to, 
now, but he’ll never get paid for 
playing again. You can work that 
horn part into the multichord line, 
or I might be able to get you a 
trumpet player. He could use a 
converter.” 

“It’ll ruin the effect.” 

Hulsey chuckled. “Sounds the 
same to everyone but you, my boy. 
I can’t tell the difference. We got 
your violins, and a cello player. 
What more do you want?” 

“Doesn’t the London Guild have 
a horn player?” 

“You want me to bring him over 
for one three-minute Com? Be rea- 
sonable, Erlin! Can I pick this up 
tomorrow?” 

“Yes. I’ll have it ready in the 
morning.” 

Hulsey reached for his briefcase, 
dropped it again, and leaned for- 
ward. “Erlin, I’m worried about 
you. I have twenty-seven tune- 
smiths in my agency. You make the 

10 


least money of any of them. Your 
net last year was twenty-two hun- 
dred. The next-highest netted 
eleven thousand.” 

“That isn’t news to me,” Baque 
said. 

“This may be. You have as many 
accounts as any of the others. Did 
you know that?” 

“No,” Baque said. “No, I didn’t 
know that.” 

“That’s right. You have as many 
accounts, but you don’t make any 
money. Want to know why? Two 
reasons. You spend too much time 
on a Com, and you write it too 
well. Sponsors can use one of your 
Corns for months — or sometimes 
even years, like that Tamper Cheese 
thing. People like to hear them. 
Now if you just didn’t write so 
damned well, you could work faster, 
and the sponsors would have to use 
more of your Corns, and you could 
turn out more.” 

“I’ve thought about that. Even if 
I didn’t, Val would keep reminding 
me. But it’s no use. That’s the way 
I have to work. If there was some 
way to get the sponsors to pay more 
for a good Com . .” 

“There isn’t. The guild wouldn’t 
stand for it, because good Corns 
mean less work, and most tune- 
smiths couldn’t write a really good 
Com. Now don’t think Pm con- 
cerned about my agency. Of course 
I make more money when you 
make more, but I’m doing well 
enough with my other tunesmiths. 
I just hate to see my best man mak- 
ing so little money. You’re a throw- 
back, Erlin. You waste time and 
money collecting those antique — 
what do you call them?” 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR, 



“Phonograph records. 51 
“Yes. And those moldy old books 
about music. I don’t doubt that you 
know more about music than any 
living man, and what does it get 
you? Not money, certainly. You’re 
the best there is, and you keep try- 
ing to be better, and the better you 
get the less money you make. Your 
income drops lower every year. 
Couldn’t you manage to be medi- 
ocre now and then?” 

“No,” Baque said. “I couldn’t 
manage it.” 

“Think it over.” 

“These accounts I have. Some 
of the sponsors really like my work. 
They’d pay more, if the guild would 
let them. Supposing I left the 
guild?” 

“You can’t, my boy. I couldn’t 
handle your stuff — not and stay in 
business long. The Tunesmiths’ 
Guild would put on the pressure, 
and the Performers’ and Lyric 
Writers’ Guilds would blacklist you. 
Jimmy Denton plays along with the 
guilds, and he’d bar your stuff from 
visiscope. You’d lose all your ac- 
counts — fast. No sponsor is big 
enough to fight all that trouble, and 
none of them would want to bother. 
So just try to be mediocre now and 
then. Think about it.” 

Baque sat staring at the floor. 
“I’ll think about it.” 

Hulsey struggled to his feet, 
clasped Baque’ s hand briefly, and 
waddled out. Baque got up slowly, 
and opened the drawer where he 
kept his meager collection of old 
phonograph records. Strange and 
wonderful music. 

Three times in his career, Baque 
had written Corns that were a full 

THE TUNESMITH 


half-hour in length. On rare occa- 
sions he got an order for fifteen 
minutes. Usually he was limited to 
five, or less. But composers like the 
B-A-C-H Baque wrote things that 
lasted an hour or more — even wrote 
them without lyrics. 

And they wrote for real instru- 
ments, even some amazing-sound- 
ing instruments that no one played 
any more, like bassoons, and pic- 
colos and pianos. 

“Damn Denton. Damn visiscope. 
Damn the guilds.” 

Baque rummaged tenderly 
among the discs until he found one 
bearing Bach’s name. Magnificat . 
Then, because he felt too despond- 
ent to listen, he pushed it away. 

Six months before the Perform- 
ers’ Guild had blacklisted its last 
oboe player. Now its last horn play- 
er, and there just weren’t any young 
people learning to play instruments. 
Why should they, where there were 
so many marvelous contraptions 
that ground out the Corns without 
any effort on the part of the per- 
former? Even multichord players 
were becoming scarce, and the 
multichord could, if one desired, 
practically play itself. 

Baque stood looking uncertainly 
about the room, from multichord 
to worktable to the battered plas- 
tic bookcase that held his old books 
on music. The door jerked open, 
and Val hurried in. 

“Did Hulsey . .” 

Baque handed her the check. She 
took it eagerly, glanced at it, and 
looked up in dismay. 

“My guild dues,” he said. “I was 
behind.” 

“Oh. Well, it’s a help, anyway.” 

11 



Her voice was flat, emotionless, 
as if one more disappointment 
really didn’t matter. Tney stood 
facing each other awkwardly. 

“I watched part of Morning with 
Marigold ” Val said. “She talked 
about your Corns.” 

“I should hear soon on that SIo- 
Smoke Com,” Baque said. “Maybe 
we can hold the landlord off for an- 
other week. Right now — I’m going 
to walk around a little.” 

“You should get out more . .” 
He closed the door behind him, 
slicing her sentence off neatly. He 
knew what followed. Get a job 
somewhere. Be good for your health 
to get out of the apartment a few 
hours a day. Write Corns in your 
spare time — they don’t bring in 
more than a part-time income, 
anyway. At least do it until we get 
caught up. All right. If you won’t, 
I will. 

But she never did. A prospective 
employer never wanted more than 
one look at her slight body and her 
worn, sullen face. And Baque 
doubted that he would receive any 
better treatment. 

He could get work as a multicord 
player, and make a good income. 
But then he’d have to join the Per- 
formers’ Guild, which meant he’d 
have to resign from the Tune- 
smiths’ Guild. So if he did that he 
could no longer write Corns. 
“Damn Corns!” 

When he reached the street, he 
stood for a moment watching the 
crowds shooting by on the swiftly- 
moving conveyer. A few people 
glanced at him, and saw a tall, 
gawky, balding man in a frayed, 
badly-fitting suit. Baque hunched 

12 


up his shoulders, and walked awk- 
wardly along the stationary side- 
walk. They would consider him 
just another derelict from a shabby 
neighborhood, he knew, and they 
would quickly look the other way 
while they hummed a snatch from 
one of his Corns. 

He turned in at a crowded res- 
taurant, found a table at one side, 
and ordered a beer. On the rear 
wall was an enormous visiscope 
screen, where the Corns followed 
each other without interruption. 
Baque listened to the Corns for a 
time, first curious to see what the 
other tunesmiths were doing, and 
then disgusted. Around him, the 
customers watched and listened 
while they ate. Some of them 
nodded their heads jerkily in time 
with the music. A few young 
couples were dancing on the small 
dance floor, skillfully changing steps 
as the music shifted from one Com 
to another. 

Baque watched them sadly, and 
thought about the way things had 
changed. At one time, he knew, 
there had been special music for 
dancing, and special groups of in- 
struments to play it. And people 
had gone to concerts by the thou- 
sands, sitting in seats with nothing 
to look at but the performers. 

All of it was gone. Not only the 
music, but art, and literature, and 
poetry. The plays he had read in 
his grandfather’s school books were 
forgotten.

national decreed that people must

attention span wouldn’t tolerate 
long programs. So there were Corns. 

. Damn Corns! 

When Val returned to the apart- 
ment an hour later, Baque was sit- 
ting in the comer staring at the 
crumbly volumes he had collected 
from the days when books were still 
printed on paper — a scattering of 
biographies, books on music history, 
and technical books on music 
theory and composition. Val looked 
twice around the room before she 
noticed him, and then she con- 
fronted him anxiously, stark tragedy 
written on her face. 

“The man’s coming to fix the 
food synthesizer.” 

“Good,” Baque said. 

“But the landlord won’t wait. If 
we don’t pay him day after to- 
morrow — pay him everything — 
we’re out.” 

“So we’re out.” 

“Where will we go? We can’t get 
in anywhere without paying some- 
thing in advance.” 

“So we won’t get in anywhere.” 
She fled sobbing into the bed- 
room. 


T HE NEXT morning Baque re- 
signed from the Tunesmiths’ 
Guild and joined the Performers’ 
Guild. Hulsey’s round face drooped 
mournfully when he heard the 
news. He loaned Baque enough 
money to pay his guild registra- 
tion fee and quiet the landlord, 
and expressed his sorrow in elo- 
quent terms as he hurried Baque 
out of his office. He would, Baque 
knew, waste no time in assigning 
Baque’s clients to his other tune- 

THE TUNESMITH 


smiths — to men who worked faster 
and not so well. 

Baque went to the guild hall, 
where he sat for five hours waiting 
for a multichord assignment. He 
was finally escorted into the secre- 
tary’s office, and brusquely mo- 
tioned into a chair. The secretary 
eyed him suspiciously. 

“You belonged to the Perform- 
ers’ Guild twenty years ago, and 
you left it to become a tunesmith. 
Right?” 

“Right,” Baque said. 

“You lost your seniority after 
three years. You knew that, didn’t 
you?” 

“I didn’t, but I didn’t think it 
mattered. There aren’t many good 
multichord players around.” 

“There aren’t many good jobs 
around, either. You’ll have to start 
at the bottom.” He scribbled on a 
slip of paper, and thrust it at Baque. 
“This one pays well, but we have a 
hard time keeping a man there. 
Lankey isn’t easy to work for. If you 
don’t irritate him too much — well, 
then we’ll see.” 

Baque found himself outside the 
door, staring hard at the slip of 
paper. 

He rode the conveyer out to the 
New Jersey Space Port, floundered 
about through a rattle-trap slum 
area getting his directions hopeless- 
ly confused, and finally found the 
place almost within radiation dis- 
tance of the port. The sprawling 
building had burned at some time 
in the remote past. Stubby rem- 
nants of walls rose out of the weed- 
choked rubble. A walk curved back 
from the street towards a dimly lit 

13 



cavity at one corner of the build- 
ing. Steps led uncertainly down- 
wards. Overhead, an enormous sign 
pointed its flowing colors in the 
direction of the port. The Lankey - 
Pank Out . 

Baque stepped through the door, 
and faltered at the onslaught of 
extraterrestrial odors. Lavender- 
tinted Venusian tobacco smoke 
hung like a limp blanket midway 
between floor and ceiling. The re- 
volting, cutting fumes of Martian 
Whiskey staggered him. He had a 
glimpse of a scattered gathering of 
tough spacers and tougher prosti- 
tutes before the doorman planted 
his bulky figure and scarred cari- 
cature of a face in front of him. 

“You looking for someone?” 

“Mr. Lankey.” 

The doorman jerked a thumb to- 
wards the bar, and noisily stumbled 
back into the shadows. Baque 
walked towards the bar. 

He had no trouble picking out 
Lankey. The proprietor sat on a 
tall stool behind the bar, and thrust 
his bald head forward to watch him 
coldly as he approached. In the 
dim, smoke-streaked light his taut 
pale face had a spectral grimness. 
He planted one elbow on the bar, 
fingered his flattened stump of a 
nose with the two remaining fingers 
on one hairy hand, and stared at 
Baque with burning, bloodshot 
eyes. 

“I’m Erlin Baque,” Baque said. 

“Yeh. The multichord player. 
Can you play that multichord, fel- 
low?” 

“Why, yes, I can play . .” 

“That’s what they all say. And 
I’ve had maybe two in the last five 


years that could really play. Most 
of them come out here figuring 
they’ll set the thing on automatic, 
and fuss around with one finger. I 
want that multichord played , fel- 
low, and I’ll tell you right now — 
if you can’t play you might as well 
jet for home base, because there 
isn’t any automatic on my multi- 
chord. I had it disconnected.” 

“I can play,” Baque told him. 

“All right. I’ll find out soon 
enough. The guild rates this place 
as Class Four, but I pay Class One 
rates if you can play. If you can 
really play, I’ll slip you some bo- 
nuses the guild won’t know about. 
Hours are from six P.M. to six 
A.M., but you get plenty of breaks, 
and if you get hungry or thirsty just 
ask for what you want. Only go easy 
on the hot stuff. I won’t do with a 
drunk multichord player, no mat- 
ter how good he is. Rose!” 

He bellowed a second time, and 
a woman stepped out of a door at 
the side of the room. She wore a 
faded dressing gown, and her 
tangled hair hung untidily about 
her shoulders. She turned a small, 
pretty face towards Baque, and 
studied him boldly. 

“Multichord,” Lankey said. 
“Show him.” 

Rose beckoned, and Baque fol- 
lowed her towards the rear of the 
room. Suddenly he stopped in 
amazement. 

“What’s the matter?” Rose said. 

“No visiscope!” 

“No. Lankey says the spacers 
want better things to look at than 
soap suds and air cars.” She gig- 
gled. “Something like me, for ex- 
ample.”

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



“I never heard of a restaurant 
without visiscope.” 

“Neither did I, until I came here. 
But Lankey’s got three of us to 
sing the Corns, and you’re to do the 
multichord with us. I hope you 
make the grade. We haven’t had 
a multichord player for a week, and 
it’s hard singing without one.” 

‘Til make out all right,” Baque 
said. 

A narrow platform stretched 
across the end of the room, where 
any other restaurant Baque had 
seen had its visiscope screen. There 
had been one here at one time, he 
noticed. He could see the un- 
patched scars in the wall where it 
had been torn out. 

“Lankey ran a joint on Venus 
back when they didn’t have visi- 
scope there,” Rose said. “He has his 
own ideas about how to entertain 
customers. Want to see your 
room?” 

Baque did not answer. He was 
examining the multichord. It was a 
battered old instrument, and it bore 
the marks of more than one brawl. 
He fingered the filter buttons, and 
swore softly to himself. Most of 
them were broken. Only the flute 
and violin filters clicked into place 
properly. So he would have to spend 
twelve hours a day with the twang- 
ing tones of an unfiltered multi- 
chord. 

“Want to see your room?” Rose 
said again. “It’s only five. Might 
as well relax before we have to go 
to work.” 

Rose showed him a cramped en- 
closure behind the bar. He 
stretched out on a hard cot and 
tried to relax, and then it was six 

THE TUNESMITH 


o’clock, and Lankey stood in the 
door beckoning at him. 

He took his place at the multi- 
chord, and sat fingering the keys. 
He felt no nervousness. There 
wasn’t anything he didn’t know 
about Corns, and he knew he 
wouldn’t have trouble with the 
music. But the atmosphere dis- 
turbed him. The haze of smoke 
was thicker, and he blinked his 
smarting eyes and felt the whiskey 
fumes tear at his nostrils when he 
took a deep breath. 

There was still only a scattering 
of customers — mechanics in grimy 
work suits, swaggering pilots, a few 
civilians who liked their liquor 
strong and didn’t mind the sur- 
roundings. And women. Two 
women, he guessed, for every man 
in the room. 

There was a sudden stirring, a 
yelp of approval, and an unre- 
strained stomping of feet. Lankey 
was crossing the platform with 
Rose, and the other singers. Baque’s 
first horrified impression was that 
the girls were nude, but as they 
came closer he made out their brief 
plastic costumes. Lankey was right, 
he thought. The spacers would 
much prefer looking at that to 
animated Corns on a visiscope 
screen. 

“You met Rose,” Lankey said. 
“This is Zanna and Mae. Let’s get 
going.” 

He walked away, and the girls 
gathered around the multichord. 
“What Corns do you know?” Rose 
said. 

“I know them all.” 

She looked at him doubtfully. 
“We sing together, and then we 


15 



take turns. You’re — sure you know 
them all?” 

Baque flipped on the power, and 
sounded a chord. “You sing, and 
I’ll handle this.” 

“We’ll start out with a Tasty- 
Malt Com. It goes like this.” She 
hummed softly. “Know that one?” 

“I wrote it,” Baque said. 

They sang better than he had ex- 
pected. He followed them easily, 
and was able to keep his eyes on 
the customers. Heads were jerking 
in time with the music, and he 
quickly caught the mood and began 
to experiment. His fingers shaped 
a rolling rhythm in the bass, fum- 
bled with it tentatively, and then 
expanded it. He abandoned the 
melodic line, leaving the girls to 
carry on by themselves while he 
searched the entire keyboard to 
ornament the driving rhythm. 

Feet began to stomp. The girl’s 
bodies were swaying wildly, and 
Baque felt himself rocking back and 
forth as the music swept on reck- 
lessly. The girls finished their lyrics, 
and when he did not stop they 
started in again. Spacers were on 
their feet, now, clapping and sway- 
ing. Some seized their women and 
began dancing in the narrow spaces 
between the tables. Finally Baque 
forced a cadence and slumped for- 
ward, panting and mopping his 
forehead. One of the girls collapsed 
on the stage, and the others hauled 
her upright. They fled to a frenzy 
of applause. 

Baque felt a hand on his shoul- 
der. Lankey. His ugly, expression- 
less face eyed Baque, turned to 
study the wildly enthusiastic cus- 
tomers, turned back to Baque. He 


nodded, and walked away. 

Rose came back alone, still 
breathing heavily. “How about a 
Sally Ann Perfume Com?” 

“Tell me the words,” Baque said. 

She recited them tonelessly. A 
tragic little story about the shat- 
tered romance of a girl who did not 
use Sally Ann. “Shall we make 
them cry?” Baque said. “Just con- 
centrate on that. It’s a sad story, 
and we’re going to make them cry.” 

She stood by the multichord, 
and sang plaintively. Baque fash- 
ioned a muted, tremulous accom- 
paniment, and when the second 
verse started he improvised a 
drooping countermelody. The 
spacers sat in hushed suspense. The 
men did not cry, but some of the 
women sniffed audibly, and when 
Rose finished there was a taut 
silence. 

“Quick,” Baque hissed. “We’ll 
brighten things up. Sing something 
— anything!” 

She launched into another Com, 
and Baque brought the spacers to 
their feet with the driving rhythm 
of his accompaniment. 

The other girls took their turns, 
and Baque watched the customers 
detachedly, bewildered at the power 
that surged in his fingers. He car- 
ried them from one emotional ex- 
treme to the other, and back again, 
improvising, experimenting. And 
his mind fumbled haltingly with 
an idea. 

“Time for a break,” Rose said 
finally. “Better get something to 
eat.” 

Seven-thirty. An hour and a 
half of continuous playing. Baque 
felt drained of strength and emo-

don, and he accepted his dinner 
tray indifferently and took it to 
the enclosure they called his room. 
He did not feel hungry. He sniffed 
doubtfully at the food, tasted it — 
and ate ravenously. Real food, 
after months of synthetics! 

He sat for awhile on the cot, 
wondering how much time the 
girls took between appearances. 
Then he went looking for Lankey. 

“I don’t like sitting around,” he 
said. “Any objection to my play- 
ing?” 

“Without the girls?” 

“Yes.” 

Lankey planted both elbows on 
the bar, cupped his chin in one 
fist, and sat looking absently at 
the far wall. “You going to sing 
yourself?” he said finally. 

“No. Just play.” 

“Without any singing? Without 
words?” 

“Yes.” 

“What will you play?” 

“Corns. Or I might improvise 
something.” 

A long silence. Then — “Think 
you could keep things moving 
while the girls are out?” 

“Of course I could.” 

Lankey continued to concentrate 
on the far wall. His eyebrows con- 
tracted, relaxed, and contracted 
again. “All right,” he said. “I was 
just wondering why I never thought 
of it.” 

Unnoticed, Baque took his place 
at the multichord. He began softly, 
making the music an unobtrusive 
background to the rollicking con- 
versation that filled the room. As 
he increased the volume, faces 
turned in his direction. 


He wondered what those people 
were thinking, hearing for the first 
time music that was not a Com, 
music without words. He watched 
intently, and satisfied himself that 
he was holding their attention. Now 
— could he bring them out of their 
seats with nothing more than the 
sterile tones of a multichord? He 
gave the melody a rhythmic snap, 
and the stomping began. 

As he increased the volume again, 
Rose came stumbling out of a 
doorway and hurried across the 
stage, perplexity written on her pert 
face. 

“It’s all right,” Baque told her. 
“I’m just playing to amuse myself. 
Don’t come back until you’re 
ready.” 

She nodded, and walked away. 
A red-faced spacer near the plat- 
form looked up at the revealed out- 
line of her young body, and leered. 
Fascinated, Baque studied the 
coarse, demanding lust in his face, 
and searched the keyboard to ex- 
press it. This? Or — this? Or — 

He had it. His body rocked as he 
felt himself caught up in the re- 
lentless rhythm. His foot tightened 
on the volume control, and he 
turned to watch the customers. 

Every pair of eyes stared hyp- 
notically at his comer of the room. 
A bartender stood at a half crouch, 
mouth agape. There was uneasiness, 
a strained shuffling of feet, a rest- 
less scraping of chairs. Baque’s 
foot dug harder at the volume con- 
trol. 

Terrified, he sat watching the 
scene that erupted below him. 
Lasciviousness twisted every face. 
Men were on their feet, reaching 


THE TUNESMITH 


17 



for the women, clutching, pawing. 
A chair crashed to the floor, and a 
table, and no one seemed to notice. 
A woman’s dress fluttered crazily 
downwards, and the pursued were 
pursuers while Baque’s fingers raced 
onward, out of control. 

With a violent effort he 
wrenched his hands from the keys, 
and the moment of silence crashed 
into the room like thunder. Fingers 
trembling, he began to play softly, 
indifferently. Order was restored 
when he looked again, the chair 
and table were upright, and the 
customers were seated in apparent 
relaxation — except for one woman, 
struggling back into her dress in 
obvious embarrassment. 

Baque continued to play quietly 
until the girls returned. 

Six A.M. Body aching with 
weariness, hands aching, legs 
cramped, Baque climbed down 
from the multichord. Lankey stood 
waiting for him. 

“Class One rates,” he said. 
“You’ve got a job with me as long 
as you want it. But take it a little 
easy with that stuff, will you?” 

Baque thought about Val, 
cramped in the dreary apartment, 
eating synthetic food. “Would I be 
out of order to ask for an ad- 
vance?” 

“No,” Lankey said. “Not out of 
order. I told the cashier to give you 
a hundred on your way out. Call 
it a bonus.” 

Weary from his long conveyer 
ride, Baque walked quietly into his 
dim apartment and looked about. 
No sign of Val — she would still be 
sleeping. He sat down at his own 
multichord and touched the keys. 

18 


Unbelievable. Music without 
Corns, without words, could make 
people laugh and cry, and dance, 
and cavort madly. 

And it could turn them into 
lewd animals. 

Wonderingly he played the music 
that had incited such unconcealed 
lust, played it louder, and louder . 

And felt a hand on his shoulder, 
and turned to look into Val’s pas- 
sion-twisted face. 

He asked Hulsey to come and 
hear him that night, and later 
Hulsey sat slumped on the cot in 
his room, and shuddered. “It isn’t 
right. No man should have that 
power over people. How do you 
do it?” 

“I don’t know,” Baque said. “I 
saw that young couple sitting there, 
and they were happy, and I felt 
their happiness. And as I played 
everyone in the room was happy. 
And then another couple came in, 
quarreling, and the next thing I 
knew I had everyone mad.” 

“Almost started a fight at the 
next table,” Hulsey said. “And 
what you did after that . .” 

“Yes. But not as much as I did 
last night. You should have seen it 
last night.” 

Hulsey shuddered again. 

“I have a book about Greek 
music,” Baque said. “Ancient 
Greece — way back. They had some- 
thing they called ethos. They 
thought that the different musical 
scales affected people in different 
ways. Music could make men sad, 
or happy, or enthused — or drive 
them crazy. They even claimed that 
a musician named Orpheus could

move trees and soften rocks with 
his music. Now listen. I’ve had a 
chance to experiment, and I’ve 
noticed that my playing is most 
effective when I don’t use the fil- 
ters. There are only two filters that 
work on that multichord, anyway — 
flute and violin — but when I use 
either of them the people don’t re- 
act so strongly. I’m wondering if 
it wasn’t the Greek instruments, 
rather than the scales, that pro- 
duced those effects. I’m wondering 
if the tone of an unfiltered multi- 
chord doesn’t have something in 
common with the tone of the an- 
cient Greek kithara or aulos ” 

Hulsey grunted. “I don’t think 
it’s instruments, or scales, either. I 
think it’s Baque, and I don’t like it. 
You should have stayed a tune- 
smith.” 

“I want you to help me,” Baque 
said. “I want to find a place where 
we can put a lot of people — a 
thousand, at least — not to eat, or 
watch Corns, but just to listen to 
one man play on a multichord.” 

Hulsey got up abruptly. “Baque, 
you’re a dangerous man. I’m 
damned if I’ll trust any man who 
can make me feel the way you 
made me feel tonight. I don’t 
know what you’re trying to do, but 
I won’t have any part of it.” 

He stomped away in the manner 
of a man about to slam a door. But 
a male multichordist in the Lankey- 
Pank Out did not rate the luxury 
of a door on his room. Hulsey 
paused uncertainly in the doorway, 
and disappeared. Baque followed, 
and stood watching him weave his 
way impatiently past the tables to- 
wards the exit. 


From his place behind the bar, 
Lankey looked at Baque, and 
glanced after the disappearing Hul- 
sey. “Troubles?” he said. 

Baque turned away wearily. 
“I’ve known that man for twenty 
years. I never thought he was my 
friend. But then — I never thought 
he was my enemy, either.” 

“It works out that way, some- 
times,” Lankey said. 

Baque shook his head. “I’d like 
to try some Martian whiskey. I’ve 
never tasted the stuff.” 


T WO WEEKS made Baque an 
institution at the Lankey-Pank 
Out 9 and the place was jammed to 
capacity from the time he went to 
work until he left the next morning. 
When he performed alone, he for- 
got about the Corns, and played 
what he wanted. He’d even played 
some pieces by Bach for the cus- 
tomers, and received generous ap- 
plause — though nothing like the 
tumultuous enthusiasm that fol- 
lowed his improvisations. 

Sitting behind the bar, eating 
his evening meal and watching the 
customers, Baque felt vaguely hap- 
py. For the first time in years he 
had plenty of money. He enjoyed 
the work he was doing. 

And he had begun to wonder 
how he could go about eliminating 
the Corns altogether. 

As Baque pushed aside his tray, 
he saw Biff the doorman step for- 
ward to greet another pair of cus- 
tomers, halt suddenly, and back 
away in stupefied amazement. And 
no wonder — evening clothes at the 
Lankey-Pank Out! 


THE TUNESM1TH

The couple strolled into the 
room, blinking in the dim, smoke- 
tinted light, and looking about curi- 
ously. The man was bronze and 
handsome, but no one noticed 
him. The woman’s striking beauty 
flashed like a meteor against the 
drab surroundings. She moved in 
an aura of shining loveliness. Her 
fragrance routed the foul tobacco 
and whiskey odors. Her hair 
gleamed golden, her shimmering, 
flowing gown clung seductively to 
her voluptuous figure. 

Baque stared, and suddenly rec- 
ognized her. Marigold, of Morning 
with Marigold. Worshiped around 
the Solar System by the millions of 
devotees to her visiscope program. 
Mistress, it was said, to James Den- 
ton, the czar of visiscope. Marigold 
Manning. 

She raised her hand to her mouth 
in mock horror, and the bright 
tones of her laughter dropped tan- 
talizingly among the spellbound 
spacers. 

“What an odd place,” she said. 
“Where did you ever hear about a 
place like this?” 

“I need some Martian whiskey, 
damn it,” the man muttered. 

“So stupid of the Port Bar to run 
out. With all those ships from Mars 
coming in, too. Are you sure we can 
get back in time? Jimmy’ll raise 
hell if we aren’t there when his ship 
lands.” 

Lankey touched Baque’s arm. 
“After six,” he said, without taking 
his eyes from Marigold Manning. 
“They’ll be getting impatient.” 

Baque nodded, and started for 
the multichord. And as soon as the 
customers saw him, the tumult be- 

20 


gan. He paused before taking his 
seat, and saw Marigold Manning 
and her escort staring open- 
mouthed. The sudden uproar had 
brought them up short, and they 
turned from the stomping, howling 
customers to examine this nonde- 
script man who inspired such un- 
dignified enthusiasm. 

Miss Manning’s exclamation 
rang out sharply above the noise. 
“What the hell!” 

Baque shrugged, and started to 
play. When Miss Manning finally 
left, after a brief conference with 
Lankey, her escort still hadn’t got- 
ten his Martian whiskey. 

The next evening Lankey greeted 
Baque with both fists full of tele- 
notes. “What a hell of a mess this 
is! You see this Marigold dame’s 
program this morning?” 

“Don’t think I’ve watched visi- 
scope since I came to work here.” 

“In case it interests you, you 
were — what does she call it? — a 
‘Marigold Exclusive’ on visiscope 
this morning. Erlin Baque, the fa- 
mous tunesmith, is now playing the 
multichord in a queer little restau- 
rant called the Lankey-Pank Out . 
If you want to hear some amazing 
music, wander out by the New Jer- 
sey Space Port, and hear Baque. 
Don’t miss it. The experience of a 
lifetime.” Lankey swore, and waved 
the telenotes. “Queer, she calls us. 
Now I’ve got ten thousand requests 
for reservations, some from as far 
away as Budapest and Shanghai. 
And our capacity is five hundred, 
counting standing room. Damn 
that woman! We already had all 
the business we could handle.” 

LLOYD BIGGLE, Jfc. 



“You need a bigger place,” 
Baque said. 

“Yes. Well, confidentially, I’ve 
got my eye on a big warehouse. It’ll 
seat a thousand, at least. We’ll 
clean up. I’ll give you a contract 
to take charge of the music.” 

Baque shook his head. “How 
about opening a big place up town? 
Attract people that have more 
money to spend. You run it, and 
I’ll bring in the customers.” 

Lankey caressed his flattened 
nose solemnly. “How do we split.” 

“Fifty-fifty,” Baque said. 

“No,” Lankey said thoughtfully. 
“I play fair, Baque, but fifty-fifty 
wouldn’t be right on a deal like 
that. I’d have to put up all the 
money myself. I’ll give you one- 
third, and you’re to handle the 
music.” 

They had a lawyer draw up a 
contract. Baque’s lawyer. Lankey 
insisted on that. 

In the bleak grey of early morn- 
ing Baque sleepily rode the crowded 
conveyer towards his apartment. It 
was the rush hour, when com- 
muters jammed against each other 
and snarled grumpily when a 
neighbor shifted his feet. Was the 
crowd heavier than usual? Baque 
shrugged off the jostling and el- 
bowing, and lost himself in 
thought. 

It was time he found a better 
place to live. He hadn’t minded the 
dumpy apartment as long as he 
couldn’t afford a better place, but 
Val had been complaining for 
years. And now when they could 
move, when they could have a 
luxury apartment or even a small 

THE TUNESMITH 


home over in Pennsylvania, Val re- 
fused to go. Didn’t want to leave 
her friends, she said. 

Baque mulled over this problem 
of feminine contrariness, and real- 
ized suddenly that he was ap- 
proaching his own stop. He started 
to push his way towards a decelera- 
tion strip — he shoved firmly, he at- 
tempted to step between his fellow 
riders, he applied his elbows, gently, 
at first, and then viciously. The 
crowd about him did not yield. 

“I beg your pardon,” Baque said, 
making another attempt. “I get off 
here.” 

This time a pair of brawny arms 
barred his way. “Not this morning, 
Baque. You got an appointment up 
town.” 

Baque flung a glance at the cir- 
cle of faces about him. Hard faces, 
grim, grinning faces. With a sudden 
effort Baque hurled himself side- 
ways, fighting with all his strength 
— and was hauled back roughly. 

“Up town, Baque. If you want to 
go dead, that’s your affair.” 

“Up town,” Baque agreed. 

At a public air strip they left the 
conveyer. A flyer was waiting for 
them, a plush, private job that dis- 
played a high-priority X registra- 
tion number. They flew swiftly to- 
wards down-town Manhattan, cut- 
ting recklessly across the air lanes, 
and veered in for a landing on the 
towering Visiscope International 
Building. Baque was bundled down 
an anti-gravity shaft, led through a 
labyrinth of corridors, and prodded 
none too gently into an office. 

A huge office. It was sparsely 
furnished, with a desk, some chairs, 
a bar in the far comer, an enor- 


21 



mous visiscope screen — and a 
multichord. It was crowded. 
Baque’s gaze swept the blur of faces 
and found one that was familiar. 
Hulsey. 

The plump agent took two steps 
forward, and stood glaring at 
Baque. “Day of reckoning, Erlin,” 
he said coldly. 

A hand rapped sharply on the 
desk. “I take care of any reckoning 
that’s done around here, Hulsey. 
Please sit down, Mr. Baque.” 

Baque arranged himself uncom- 
fortably on the chair that was 
thrust forward from somewhere. 
He waited, his eyes on the man be- 
hind the desk. 

“My name is James Denton. 
Does my fame extend to such out- 
of-the-way places as the Lankey- 
Pank Out? 

“No,” Baque said. “But I’ve 
heard of you.” 

James Denton. Czar of Visiscope 
International. Ruthless arbitrator 
of public taste. He was no more 
than forty, with a swarthy, hand- 
some face, flashing eyes, and a 
ready smile. 

He nodded slowly, tapped a cigar 
on the edge of his desk, and care- 
fully placed it in his mouth. Men 
on either side of him extended 
lighters. He chose one without 
glancing up, nodded again, and 
puffed deeply. 

“I won’t bore you with introduc- 
tions to this gathering, Baque. 
Some of these men are here for 
professional reasons. Some are 
here because they’re curious. I 
heard about you for the first 
/time yesterday, and what I heard 
made me think you might be a 

22 


problem. Mind you, I said ‘might 
be’ — that’s what I aim to find out. 

“When I have a problem, Baque, 
I do one of two things. I solve it, or 
I eliminate it, and I waste no time 
either way.” He chuckled. “As you 
can see from the fact that I had 
you brought in at the earliest mo- 
ment you were — shall we say — 
available?” 

“The man’s dangerous, Denton!” 
Hulsey blurted out. 

Denton flashed his smile. “I like 
dangerous men, Hulsey. They’re 
useful to have around. If I can use 
whatever it is Mr. Baque has, I’ll 
make him an attractive offer. I’m 
sure he’ll accept it gratefully. If I 
can’t use it, I aim to make damned 
certain that he won’t be inconven- 
iencing me. Do I make myself clear, 
Baque?” 

Baque stared at the floor, and 
said nothing. 

Denton leaned forward. His 
smile did not waver, but his eyes 
narrowed, and his voice was sud- 
denly icy. “Do I make myself clear, 
Baque?” 

“Yes,” Baque muttered weakly. 

Denton jerked a thumb towards 
the door, and half of those present, 
including Hulsey, solemnly filed 
out. The others waited, talking in 
whispers, while Denton puffed 
steadily on his cigar. Suddenly Den- 
ton’s intercom rasped out a single 
word. “Ready!” 

Denton pointed at the multi- 
chord. “We crave a demonstration 
of your skill, Mr. Baque. And take 
care that it’s a good demonstration. 
Hulsey is listening, and he can tell 
us if you try to stall.” 

Baque nodded, and took his place 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



at the multichord. He sat with fin- 
gers poised, and grinned at the cir- 
cle of staring faces. Overlords of 
business, they were, and never in 
their lives had they heard real 
music. As for Hulsey — yes, Hulsey 
would be listening, but over Den- 
ton’s intercom, over a communica- 
tion system designed to carry 
voices ! 

And Hulsey had a terrible ear for 
music. 

Still grinning, Baque touched the 
violin filter, touched it again, and 
faltered. 

Denton chuckled dryly. “I neg- 
lected to inform you, Mr. Baque. 
On Hulsey’s advice, we’ve had the 
filters disconnected. Now — ” 

Anger surged within Baque. He 
jammed his foot down hard on the 
volume control, insolently tapped 
out a visiscope fanfare, and started 
to play his Tamper Cheese Com. 
Face flushed, Denton leaned for- 
ward and snarled something. The 
men beside him stirred uneasily. 
Baque shifted to another Com, im- 
provised some variations, and be- 
gan to watch the faces around him. 
Overlords of the business world. It 
would be amusing, he thought, to 
make them dance and stomp their 
feet. His fingers shaped a compell- 
ing rhythm, and they began to sway 
restlessly. 

Suddenly he forgot his caution. 
Laughing silently to himself, he re- 
leased an overpowering torrent of 
sound that set the men dancing. He 
froze them in ridiculous postures 
with an outburst of surging emo- 
tion. He made them stomp reck- 
lessly, he brought tears to their eyes, 
and he finished off with the pound- 

THE TUNESMITH 


ing force that Lankey called the 
‘Sex Music.’ 

Then he slumped over the key- 
board, terrified at what he had 
done. 

Denton was on his feet, face pale, 
hands clenching and unclenching. 
“My God!” he muttered. 

He snarled a word at his inter- 
com. “Reaction?” 

“Negative,” came the prompt 
answer. 

“Let’s wind it up.” 

Denton sat down, passed his 
hand across his face, and turned to 
Baque with a bland smile. “An im- 
pressive performance, Mr. Baque. 
We’ll know in a few minutes — ah, 
here they are.” 

Those who had left earlier filed 
back into the room, and several 
men huddled together in a whis- 
pered conference. Denton got up 
from his desk, and paced the floor. 
The other men in the room, includ- 
ing Hulsey, remained standing and 
waited awkwardly. 

Baque kept his place at the mul- 
tichord, glancing uneasily about the 
room. In shifting his position he 
accidently touched a key, and the 
single tone shattered the poise of 
the conferees, spun Denton around 
wildly, and startled Hulsey into two 
steps towards the door. 

“Mr. Baque is getting impa- 
tient,” Denton called. “Can’t we 
finish this?” 

“One moment, sir.” 

They returned, finally, and ar- 
ranged themselves in two lines in 
front of Denton’s desk. The spokes- 
man, a white-haired, scholarly look- 
ing man with a delicate pink com- 
plexion, cleared his throat self-con- 


23 



sciously, and waited for Denton’s 
nod. 

“It is established,” he said, “that 
those in this room were power- 
fully affected by the music. Those 
listening on the intercom experi- 
enced no reaction except a mild 
boredom.” 

“Any fool could figure that out,” 
Denton snapped. “How does he do 
it?” 

“We can only offer a working 
hypothesis . .” 

“So you’re guessing. Let’s have 
it.” 

“Erlin Baque has the ability to 
telepathically project his emotional 
experience. When the projection is 
subtly reinforced by the tones of the 
multichord, the experience of those 
in his immediate presence is intense. 
It has no effect upon those listen- 
ing to his music at a distance.” 
“And — visiscope?” 

“Baque’s playing would have no 
effect upon visiscope listeners.” 

“I see,” Denton said. He scowled 
thoughtfully. “What about his long- 
term success?” 

“It is difficult to predict . .” 
“Predict, damn it!” 

“The novelty of his playing 
would attract attention, at first. In 
time he might develop a group of 
followers who would use the emo- 
tional experience of his playing as 
a kind of narcotic.” 

“Thank you, gentlemen,” Den- 
ton said. “That will be all.” 

The room emptied quickly. 
Hulsey paused in the doorway, 
glared hatefully at Baque, and then 
walked out meekly. 

“So I can’t use you, Baque,” 
Denton said. “But it seems you are 


no problem. I know what you and 
Lankey are up to. If I say the word, 
you would never, in this lifetime, 
find a place for your new restau- 
rant. I could have the Lankey-Pank 
Out closed down by evening. But it 
would hardly be worth the trouble. 
I won’t even insist on a visiscope 
screen in your new restaurant. If 
you can develop a cult for yourself, 
why — perhaps it will keep the 
members out of worse mischief. 
You see I feel generous this morn- 
ing, Baque. Now you’d better leave 
before I change my mind.” 

Baque nodded, and got to his 
feet. At that moment Marigold 
Manning swept into the room, radi- 
antly lovely, exotically perfumed, 
her glistening blonde hair swept up 
into the latest Martian hair style. 
“Jimmy, darling — oh!” 

She stared at Baque, stared at the 
multichord, and stammered, “Why, 
you’re — you’re — Erlin Baque! Jim- 
my, why didn’t you tell me?” 

“Mr. Baque has been favoring 
me with ^ private performance,” 
Denton said brusquely. “I think we 
understand each other, Baque. 
Good morning!” 

“You’re going to use him on 
visiscope!” Miss Manning ex- 
claimed. “Jimmy, that’s wonderful. 
May I have him first? I can work 
him in this morning.” 

Denton shook his head slowly. 
“Sorry, darling. We’ve decided that 
Mr. Baque’s talent is — not quite 
suitable for visiscope.” 

“At least I can have him for a 
guest. You’ll be my guest, won’t 
you, Mr. Baque? There’s nothing 
wrong with giving him a guest spot, 
is there Jimmy?” 


24 


LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



Denton chuckled. “No. After all 
the fuss you stirred up, it might be 
a good idea for you to guest him. 
It’ll serve you right when he flops.” 

“He won’t flop. He’ll be wonder- 
ful on visiscope. Will you come in 
this morning, Mr. Baque?” 

“Well . .” Baque began. Denton 
nodded emphatically. “We’ll be 
opening a new restaurant soon,” 
Baque went on. “I wouldn’t mind 
being your guest on opening day.” 

“A new restaurant? That’s won- 
derful! Does anyone know? I’ll give 
it out this morning as an exclu- 
sive!” 

“It isn’t exactly settled, yet,” 
Baque said apologetically. “We 
haven’t found a place . .” 

“Lankey found a place yester- 
day,” Denton said. “He’ll be sign- 
ing a lease this morning. Just let 
Miss Manning know your opening 
date, Baque, and she’ll arrange a 
spot for you. Now if you don’t 
mind . .” 

It took Baque half an hour to 
find his way out of the building, but 
he plodded aimlessly along the cor- 
ridors and disdained asking direc- 
tions. He hummed happily to him- 
self, and now and then he broke 
into a laugh. 

The overlords of the business 
world — and their scientists — knew 
nothing about overtones. 

“So that’s the way it is,” Lankey 
said. “I think we were lucky, 
Baque. Denton should have made 
his move when he had a chance — 
when I wasn’t expecting it. When 
he wises up, I’ll see that it’s too 
late.” 

“What can we do if he really de- 
THE TUNESMITH 


cides to put us out of business?” 

“I have some connections myself, 
Baque. They don’t run in high so- 
ciety, like Denton, but they’re every 
bit as dishonest. And Denton has a 
lot of enemies who’ll be glad to 
back us up. Said he could close me 
down by evening, eh? It’s a funny 
deal. There’s not much we can do 
that would hurt Denton, but there’s 
plenty we can do to keep him from 
hurting us.” 

“I think we’re going to hurt Den- 
ton,” Baque said. 

Lankey moved over to the bar, 
and came back with a tall glass of 
pink, foaming liquid. “Drink it,” he 
said. “You’ve had a long day, and 
you’re getting delirious. How could 
we hurt Denton?” 

“Corns. Visiscope depends on 
Corns. We’ll show the people they 
can have entertainment without 
them. We’ll make our motto NO 
COMS AT LANKEY’S!” 

“Great,” Lankey drawled. “I just 
invest a thousand in fancy new cos- 
tumes for the girls — they can’t wear 
those plastic things in our new 
place, you know — and you decide 
not to let them sing.” 

“Certainly they’re going to sing.” 
Lankey leaned forward, caressing 
his nose. “And no Corns. Then 
what are they going to sing?” 

“I took some lyrics out of an old 
school book my grandfather had. 
They’re called poems, and I’m 
writing music for them. I was going 
to try them out here, but Denton 
might hear about it, and there’s no 
use starting trouble before it’s nec- 
essary.” 

“No. Save them for the new 
place. And you’ll be on Morning 


25 



with Marigold the day we open. 
Are you certain about this over- 
tones stuff, Baque? You really could 
be projecting emotions, you know. 
Not that it will make any difference 
in the restaurant, but on visi- 
scope . 

“I’m certain. How soon can we 
open?” 

“I’ve got three shifts remodeling 
the place. We’ll seat twelve hun- 
dred, and have room for a nice 
dance floor. Should be ready in two 
weeks. But I’m not sure this visi- 
scope deal is wise, Baque.” 

“I want to do it.” 

Lankey went back to the bar, and 
got a drink for himself. “All right. 
You do it. If your stuff comes over, 
all hell is going to break loose, and 
I might as well start getting ready 
for it.” He grinned. “Damned if it 
won’t be good for business!” 

ARIGOLD MANNING had 
changed her hair styling to the 
latest creation of Zann of Hong 
Kong, and she dallied for ten min- 
utes in deciding which profile she 
would present to the cameras. 
Baque waited patiently, a bit un- 
comfortable in the most expensive 
dress suit he had ever owned. He 
was wondering if perhaps he really 
did project emotions. 

“I’ll have it this way,” Miss Man- 
ning said finally, waving a pilot 
screen in front of her face for a 
last, searching look. “And you, Mr. 
Baque? What will we do with 
you?” 

“Just put me at the multichord,” 
Baque said. 

“But you can’t just play. You’ll 

26 


have to say something. I’ve been 
announcing this every day for a 
week, and we’ll have the biggest 
audience in years, and you’ll just 
have to say something.” 

“Gladly,” Baque said. “If I can 
talk about Lankey 9 s ” 

“But of course, you silly man. 
That’s why you’re here. You talk 
about Lankey* s, and I’ll talk about 
Erlin Baque.” 

“Five minutes,” a voice an- 
nounced crisply. 

“Oh, dear,” she said. “I’m al- 
ways so nervous just before.” 

“Be happy you’re not nervous 
during,” Baque said. 

“That’s so right. Jimmy just 
makes fun of me, but it takes an 
artist to understand another artist. 
Do you get nervous?” 

“When I’m playing, I’m much 
too busy.” 

“That’s just the way it is with 
me. Once my program starts, I’m 
much too busy . .” 

“Four minutes . .” 

“Oh, bother!” She seized the 
pilot screen again. “Maybe I would 
have been better the other way.” 
Baque seated himself at the mul- 
tichord. “You’re perfect the way 
you are.” 

“Do you really think so? It’s a 
nice thing to say, anyway. I wonder 
if Jimmy will take the time to 
watch.” 

“I’m sure he will.” 

“Three minutes . .” 

Baque threw on the power, and 
sounded a chord. Now he was nerv- 
ous. He had no idea what he was 
going to play. He’d intentionally re- 
frained from preparing something, 
because it was his improvisations 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




that affected people so strangely. 
Only one thing was certain — there 
would be no Sex Music. Lankey 
had warned him about that. 

He lost himself in thought, failed 
to hear the final warning, and 
looked up startled at Miss Man- 
ning’s cheerful, “Good morning, 
everyone. It’s Morning with Mari- 
gold!” 

Her bright voice wandered on 
and on. Erlin Baque. His career as 
a tunesmith. Her amazing discovery 
of him playing in the Lankey-Pank 
Out . She ran the Tamper Cheese 
Com. Finally she finished her re- 
marks, and risked the distortion of 
her lovely profile to glance in his 
direction. “Ladies and gentlemen, 
with admiration, with pride, with 
pleasure, I give you a Marigold Ex- 
clusive, Erlin Baque!” 

Baque grinned nervously, and 
coyly tapped out a scale with one 
finger. “This is my first speech,” he 
said. “Probably it’ll be my last. The 
new restaurant opens tonight. 
Lankey’ s, on Broadway. Unfortu- 
nately I can’t invite you to join us, 
because thanks to Miss Manning’s 
generous comments this past week 
all space is reserved for the next 
two months. After that we’ll be 
setting aside a limited number of 
reservations for visitors from dis- 
tant places. Jet over and see us! 

“You’ll find something different 
at Lankey’ s. There is n& visiscope 
screen. Maybe you’ve heard about 
that. We have attractive young 
ladies to sing for you. I play the 
multichord. We know you’ll enjoy 
our music. We know you’ll enjoy it 
because you’ll hear no Corns at 
Lankey’ s. Remember that — No 

THE TUNESMITH 


Corns at Lankey’s. No soap with 
your soup. No air cars with your 
steaks. No shirts with your desserts. 
No Corns! Just good music played 
for your enjoyment — like this.” 

He brought his hands down on 
the keyboard. 

It was a strange experience, play- 
ing with no audience, or practically 
no audience. There was only Miss 
Manning, and the visiscope engi- 
neers, and Baque was suddenly ap- 
prehensive that his audiences were 
responsible for his success. He’d al- 
ways had a throng of faces to 
watch, and he had paced his play- 
ing according to their reactions. 
People were listening all over the 
Western Hemisphere. And later it 
would be all over Earth, and all 
over the Solar System. Would they 
be clapping and stomping? Would 
they be thinking awesomely, “So 
that’s how music sounds without 
words, without Corns?” Or would 
they be listening in mild boredom? 

Baque caught a glimpse of Miss 
Manning’s pale face, of the engi- 
neers watching with mouths agape, 
and thought maybe everything was 
all right. He lost himself in the 
music, and played fervently. 

He continued to play after he 
knew that something had gone 
wrong. Miss Manning leaped to her 
feet and hurried towards him, the 
engineers were moving about con- 
fusedly, and the distant pilot screen 
was blank. Baque slowed down, and 
brought his playing to a halt. 

“We were cut off,” Miss Man- 
ning said tearfully. “Who would do 
such a thing to me? Never, never, 
in all the time I’ve been on visiscope 
— George, who cut us off?” 


27 



“Orders.” 

“Whose orders?” 

“My orders!” James Denton 
strode towards them, and he was 
not smiling. His lips were tight, his 
face pale, his eyes gleaming vio- 
lence and sudden death. “Pretty 
bright boy, aren’t you?” he said to 
Baque. “I don’t know how you 
worked that trick, but no man 
fools James Denton more than 
once. Now you’ve made yourself a 
problem, and I’m not going to 
bother solving it. Consider yourself 
eliminated.” 

“Jimmy!” Miss Manning wailed. 
“My program — cut off. How could 
you?” 

“Shut up, damn it! I’ll give you 
any odds you want, Baque, that 
Lankey’s doesn’t open tonight. Not 
that it’s going to make any differ- 
ence to you.” 

Baque smiled gently. “I think 
you’ve lost, Denton. I think enough 
music got over to beat you. I’ll give 
you any odds you want that you’ll 
have several thousand complaints 
by tomorrow. So will the govern- 
ment. And then you’ll find out who 
really runs Visiscope Interna- 
tional” 

“ I run Visiscope International” 

“No, Denton. It belongs to the 
people. They’ve let things slide for 
a long time, and taken anything 
you’d give them. But if they know 
what they want, they’ll get it. I 
know I gave them at least three 
minutes of what they want. That 
was more than I’d hoped for.” 

“How did you work that trick in 
my office?” 

“You tricked yourself, Denton — 
because you didn’t know about 

28 


overtones. Your intercom wasn’t 
built to carry music. It doesn’t carry 
the upper frequencies at all, so the 
multichord sounded dead to the 
men in the other room. But visi- 
scope has the frequency range of 
live sound.” 

Denton nodded. “Clever. I’ll 
have the heads of some scientists, 
for that. And I’ll have your head, 
Baque.” 

He stalked away, and as the 
automatic door closed behind 
him, Marigold Manning clutched 
Baque’s arm. “Quick! Follow me!” 
As Baque hesitated, she hissed, 
“Don’t stand there like an idiot! 
He’ll have you killed.” 

She led him through a control 
room, and out into a small corridor. 
They raced down it, darted through 
a reception room past a startled 
secretary, and out a rear door into 
another corridor. She jerked him 
after her into an anti-grav lift, and 
they shot upwards. At the top of 
the building she hurried him to the 
air car landing strip, and left him 
standing in a doorway. 

“When I give you a signal, you 
walk out,” she said. “Don’t run, 
just walk.” 

She walked out calmly, and 
Baque heard an attendant’s sur- 
prised greeting. “Through early this 
morning, Miss Manning?” 

“We’re running a lot of Corns,” 
she said. “I want the big Waring.” 
“Coming right up.” 

Peering around the comer, Baque 
saw her step into the flyer. As soon 
as the attendant’s back was turned, 
she waved frantically. Baque 
walked carefully towards her, keep- 
ing the Waring between the attend-

ant and himself. A moment later 
they were shooting upwards, and 
below them a siren sounded faintly. 

“We did it!” she gasped. “If you 
hadn’t gotten out before that alarm 
sounded, you wouldn’t have gotten 
out at all.” 

Baque took a deep breath, and 
looked back at the Visiscope Inter- 
national Building. “Well, thanks,” 
he said. “But surely that wasn’t 
necessary. This is a civilized 
planet.” 

“Visiscope International is not 
civilized!” she snapped. 

He looked at her wonderingly. 
Her face was flushed, her eyes 
wide with fear, and for the first 
time Baque saw her as a human 
being, a woman, a lovely woman. 
As he looked, she turned away 
and burst into tears. 

“Now Jimmy’ll have me killed, 
too. And where will we go?” 

“Lankey’ s” Baque said. “Look — 
you can see it from here.” 

She pointed the air car at the 
freshly painted letters on the strip 
above the new restaurant, and 
Baque, looking backwards, saw a 
crowd forming in the street by Visi- 
scope International . 

Lankey floated his desk over to 
the wall, and leaned back comfort- 
ably. He wore a trim dress suit, 
and he had carefully groomed him- 
self for the role of a jovial host, 
but in his office he was the same 
ungainly Lankey Baque had first 
seen leaning over a bar. 

“I told you all hell would break 
loose,” he said flatly. “There are 
five thousand people over by Visi- 
scope International , screaming for 

THE TUNESMITH 


Erlin Baque. And the crowd is 
growing.” 

“I didn’t play for more than 
three minutes,” Baque said. “I 
thought a lot of people might write 
in to complain about their cutting 
me off, but I didn’t expect any- 
thing like that.” 

“You didn’t, eh? Five thousand 
people. Probably ten thousand, by 
now, and nobody knows where it 
will stop. And Miss Manning, here, 
risks her neck to get you out of 
the place — ask her why, Baque.” 
“Yes,” Baque said. “Why go to 
all that trouble for me?” 

She shuddered. “Your music does 
things to me.” 

“It sure does,” Lankey said. 
“Baque, you fool, you gave a 
quarter of Earth’s population three 
minutes of Sex Music!” 


L ANKEY’S OPENED on sched- 
ule that evening, with crowds 
filling the street outside, and strug- 
gling in as long as there was stand- 
ing room. The shrewd Lankey had 
instituted an admission charge. 
The standees bought no food, and 
Lankey couldn’t see the point in 
furnishing free music, even if 
people were willing to stand to 
hear it. 

There was one last-minute 
change. Lankey decided that the 
customers would prefer a glamorous 
hostess to a flat-nosed old host, and 
he hired Marigold Manning. She 
moved about gracefully, the deep 
blue of her flowing gown offsetting 
her golden hair. 

When Baque took his place at 
the multichord, the frenzied ova- 


29 



tion lasted for twenty minutes. 

Midway through the evening, 
Baque sought out Lankey. “Has 
Denton tried anything ?” 

“Not a thing. Everything is run- 
ning smoothly.” 

“It seems odd. He swore we 
wouldn’t open tonight.” 

Lankey chuckled. “He’s had 
troubles of his own to worry about. 
The authorities are on his neck 
about that rioting this afternoon. 
I was afraid they would blame you, 
but they didn’t. Denton put you 
on, and then he cut you off, and 
they figure he’s responsible. And 
according to my last report, Visi- 
scope International has had more 
than ten million complaints. Don’t 
worry, Baque. We’ll hear from 
Denton soon enough — and the 
guilds, too.” 

“The guilds? Why the guilds?” 
“The Tunesmiths’ Guild will be 
damned furious about your cutting 
out the Corns. The Lyric Writers’ 
Guild will go along with them, 
on account of the Corns, and on ac- 
count of your using music without 
words. The Performers’ Guild 
won’t like you because not many of 
its members can play worth a 
damn. By tomorrow morning, 
Baque, you’ll be the most popular 
man in the Solar System, and the 
sponsors, and the visiscope people, 
and the guilds are going to hate 
your guts. I’m giving you a twenty- 
four hour bodyguard, and Miss 
Manning, too. I want you to come 
out of this alive.” 

“Do you really think Denton 
would . .” 

“Denton would.” 

The next morning the Perform- 


ers’ Guild blacklisted Lankey’s , and 
ordered all the musicians, includ- 
ing Baque, to sever relations. The 
musicians respectfully declined, and 
found themselves blacklisted before 
noon. Lankey called in a lawyer, 
the most sinister, furtive, disrepu- 
table-looking individual Baque had 
ever seen. 

“They’re supposed to give us a 
week’s notice,” Lankey said, “and 
another week if we decide to ap- 
peal. I’ll sue them for five million.” 

The Commissioner of Public 
Safety called, and a little later, the 
Liquor Commissioner. Both con- 
ferred briefly with Lankey, and 
departed grim-faced. 

“Denton’s moving too late,” 
Lankey said gleefully. “I got to 
both of them a week ago, and re- 
corded our conversations. They 
don’t dare take any action.” 

A riot broke out in front of 
Lankey’s that night. Lankey had 
his own riot squad ready for action, 
and the customers never noticed 
the disturbance. Lankey’s inform- 
ants estimated that more than 
fifty million complaints had been 
received by Visiscope Internation- 
al . An anti-Com demonstration 
erupted spontaneously, and five 
hundred visiscope screens were 
smashed in Manhattan restaurants. 

Lankey 9 s finished its first week 
unmolested, entertaining capacity 
crowds daily. Reservations were 
pouring in from as far away as 
Venus and Mars. Baque sent to 
Berlin for a multichordist to under- 
study him, and Lankey hoped by 
the end of the month to have the 
restaurant open twenty-four hours 
a day.

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



At the beginning of the second 
week, Lankey told Baque, “We’ve 
got Denton licked. I’ve countered 
every move he’s made, and now 
we’re going to make a few moves. 
You’re going on visiscope again. 
I’m making application today. 
We’re legitimate business, and 
we’ve got as much right to buy time 
as anyone else. If he won’t give it to 
us, I’ll sue. He won’t dare refuse.” 

“Where do you get the money for 
all this?” Baque said. 

Lankey grinned. “I saved it up. 
And I’ve had a little help from peo- 
ple who don’t like Denton.” 

Denton didn’t refuse. Baque did 
an Earth-wide program direct from 
Lankey’s, with Marigold Manning 
introducing him. He omitted only 
the Sex Music. 

Quitting time at Lankey* s . Baque 
was in his dressing room, wearily 
changing. Lankey had already left 
for an early-morning conference 
with his lawyer. They were spec- 
ulating on Denton’s next move. 

Baque was uneasy. He was, he 
told himself, only a dumb musician. 
He didn’t understand legal prob- 
lems, or the tangled web of connec- 
tions and influence that Lankey 
negotiated so easily. He knew James 
Denton was the incarnation of evil. 
He also knew that Denton had 
enough money to buy Lankey a 
thousand times over. Or pay for 
the murder of anyone who got in 
his way. What was he waiting for? 
With enough time, Baque might 
deliver a death-blow to the whole 
institution of Corns. Denton would 
know that. 

So what was he waiting for? 

THE TUNESMITH 


The door burst open, and Mari- 
gold Manning stumbled in half un- 
dressed, her pale face the bleached 
whiteness of her plastic breast cups. 
She slammed the door and leaned 
against it, sobs shaking her body. 

“Jimmy,” she gasped. “I got a 
note from Carol — that’s his secre- 
tary. She was a good friend of 
mine. She says Jimmy’s bribed our 
guards, and they’re going to kill us 
on the way home this morning. Or 
let Jimmy’s men kill us.” 

“I’ll call Lankey,” Baque said. 
“There’s nothing to worry about.” 
“No! If they suspect anything 
they won’t wait. We won’t have a 
chance.” 

“Then we’ll just wait until 
Lankey gets back.” 

“Do you think it’s safe to wait? 
They know we’re getting ready to 
leave.” 

Baque sat down heavily. It was 
the sort of move he expected Den- 
ton to make. Lankey picked his 
men carefully, he knew, but then 
— Denton had enough money to 
buy any man. And yet . 

“Maybe it’s a trap,” he said. 
“Maybe that note’s a fake.” 

“No. I saw that fat little man 
Hulsey talking with one of your 
guards last night, and I knew Jim- 
my was up to something.” 

So that was it. Hulsey. “What do 
you want to do?” Baque said. 

“Could we get out the back 
way?” 

“I don’t know. We’d have to get 
past at least one guard.” 

“Couldn’t we try?” 

Baque hesitated. She was fright- 
ened. She was sick with fright. But 
she knew far more about this sort 


31 



of thing than he did. And she knew 
James Denton. He’d never have 
gotten out of Visiscope Internation - 
al without her help. 

“If you think that’s the thing to 
do, we’ll try it.” 

“I’ll have to finish changing.” 
“Go ahead, then. Let me know 
when you’re ready.” 

She looked cautiously out the 
door, and turned back, fear over- 
coming modesty. “No. You come 
with me.” 

Baque and Miss Manning walked 
leisurely along the corridor at the 
back of the building, nodded to the 
two guards that sat there alertly, 
and with a sudden movement were 
through the door. Running. A 
shout of surprise came from behind 
them, nothing more. They dashed 
frantically down an alley, turned 
off, reached another intersection, 
and hesitated. 

“The conveyer is that way,” she 
gasped. “If we can reach the con- 
veyer . .” 

“Let’s go!” 

They ran on, hand in hand. Far 
ahead of them the alley opened 
onto a street. Baque glanced anx- 
iously upwards for air cars, and saw 
none. Exactly where they were he 
did not know. 

“Are we — being followed?” 

“I don’t think so. There aren’t 
any air cars, and I didn’t see any- 
one behind us when we stopped.” 
“Then we got away!” 

Thirty feet ahead of them, a man 
stepped abruptly out of the dawn 
shadows. As they halted, stricken 
dumb with panic, he walked to- 
wards them. A hat was pulled low 
over his face, but there was no mis- 

32 


taking the smile. James Denton. 

“Good morning, beautiful,” he 
said. “ Visiscope International 

hasn’t been the same without your 
lovely presence. And a good morn- 
ing to you, Mr. Baque.” 

They stood silently, Miss Man- 
ning’s hand clutching Baque’s arm, 
her nails cutting through his shirt 
and into his flesh. He did not move. 

“I thought you’d fall for that lit- 
tle gag, beautiful. I thought you’d 
be just frightened enough, by now, 
to fall for it. I have every exit 
blocked, but I’m grateful to you 
for picking this one. Very grateful. 
I like to settle in person for a dou- 
ble cross.” 

Suddenly he whirled on Baque, 
his voice an angry snarl. “Get go- 
ing, Baque. It isn’t your turn, yet. I 
have other plans for you.” 

Baque stood rooted to the damp 
pavement. 

“Move, Baque, before I change 
my mind.” 

Miss Manning released his arm. 
Her voice was a choking whisper. 
“Go!” she said. 

“Baque!” 

“Go, quickly,” she whispered 
again. 

Baque took two hesitant steps. 

“Run!” Denton shouted. 

Baque ran. Behind him there was 
the evil crack of a gun, a scream, 
and silence. Baque faltered, saw 
Denton looking after him, and ran 
on. 

“So I’m a coward,” Baque said. 

“No, Baque.” Lankey shook his 
head slowly. “You’re a brave man, 
or you wouldn’t have gotten into 
this. It wouldn’t have been bravery, 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



to try something there. It would 
have been foolishness. It’s my fault, 
for thinking he’d move first against 
the restaurant. I owe Denton some- 
thing for this, Baque, and I’m a 
man who pays his debts.” 

A troubled frown creased 
Lankey’s ugly face. He looked oddly 
at Baque, and scratched his bald 
head. “She was a brave and beauti- 
ful woman, Baque. But I wonder 
why Denton let you go.” 

The air of tragedy that hung 
heavily over Lankey’s that night 
did not affect the customers. They 
gave Baque a thunderous ovation 
as he moved towards the multi- 
chord. As he paused for a half- 
hearted bow, three policemen 
closed in on him. 

“Erlin Baque?” 

“That’s right.” 

“You’re under arrest.” 

Baque grinned. Denton wasn’t 
long in making his next move. 
“What’s the charge?” he said. 
“Murder.” 

The murder of Marigold Man- 
ning. 

ANKEY PRESSED his mourn- 
ful face against the bars, and 
talked unhurriedly. “They have 
some witnesses,” he said, “honest 
witnesses, who saw you run out of 
that alley. They have several dis- 
honest witnesses, who saw you fire 
the shot. One of them is your friend 
Hulsey, who just happened to be 
taking an early-morning stroll along 
that alley — or so he’ll testify. Den- 
ton would probably spend a million 
to convict you, but he won’t have 
to. He won’t even have to bribe the 


jury. The case against you is that 
good.” 

“What about the gun,” Baque 
said. 

“They found it. No fingerprints, 
of course. But someone will claim 
you were wearing gloves, or some- 
one will have seen you wipe it off.” 

Baque nodded. Things were out 
of his hands, now. He’d worked for 
a cause that no one understood — 
perhaps he didn’t understand him- 
self what he was trying to do. And 
he’d lost. 

“What happens next?” 

Lankey shook his head. “I’m not 
one to hold back bad news. It 
means life. They’re going to send 
you to the Ganymede rock pits for 
life.” 

“I see,” Baque said. He added 
anxiously, “You’re going to carry 
on?” 

“Just what were you trying to do, 
Baque? You weren’t only working 
for Lankey’s. I couldn’t figure it 
out, but I went along with you be- 
cause I like you. And I like your 
music. What was it?” 

“I don’t know.” A concert? A 
thousand people gathered together 
to hear music? Was that what he 
wanted? “Music, I suppose,” he 
said. “Get rid of the Corns — or 
some of them.” 

“Yes. Yes, I think I understand. 
Lankey’s will carry on, Baque, as 
long as I have any breath left. That 
new multichord player isn’t bad. 
He’s nothing like you were, but 
then — there’ll never be another one 
like you were. We’re still turning 
people away. Several other restau- 
rants are doing away with visiscope 
and trying to imitate us, but we 



THE TUNESM1TH 


33 



have a big head start. We’ll carry 
on the way you had things set up, 
and your one-third still stands. I’ll 
have it put in trust for you. You’ll 
be a wealthy man when you get 
back.” 

“When I get back!” 

“Well — a life sentence doesn’t 
necessarily mean life. See that you 
behave yourself.” 

“Val?” 

“She’ll be taken care of. I’ll give 
her a job of some kind, to keep her 
occupied.” 

“Maybe I can send you music for 
the restaurant,” Baque said. “I 
should have plenty of time.” 

“I’m afraid not. It’s music they 
want to keep you away from. So — 
no writing of music. And they won’t 
let you near a multichord. They 
think you could hypnotize the 
guards, and turn all the prisoners 
loose.” 

“Would they — let me have my 
record collection?” 

“I’m afraid not.” 

“I see. Well, if that’s the way it 
is . .” 

“It is. Now I owe Denton two 
debts.” 

The unemotional Lankey had 
tears in his eyes as he turned away. 

The jury deliberated for eight 
minutes, and brought in a verdict 
of guilty. Baque was sentenced to 
life imprisonment. There was some 
editorial grumbling on visiscope, 
because life in the Ganymede rock 
pits was frequently a very short life. 

And there was a swelling under- 
tone of whispering among the little 
people that the verdict was bought 
and paid for by the sponsors, by 
visiscope. Erlin Baque was framed, 


it was said, because he gave the 
people music. 

And on the day Baque left for 
Ganymede, announcement was 
made of a public exhibition, by H. 
Vail, multichordist, and B. John- 
son, violinist. Admission one dollar. 

Lankey collected evidence with 
painstaking care, rebribed one of 
the bribed witnesses, and petitioned 
for a new trial. The petition was 
denied, and the long years limped 
past. 

The New York Symphony Or- 
chestra was organized, with twenty 
members. One of James Denton’s 
plush air cars crashed, and he was 
instantly killed. An unfortunate ac- 
cident. A millionaire who once 
heard Erlin Baque play on visiscope 
endowed a dozen conservatories of 
music. They were to be called the 
Baque Conservatories, but a musi- 
cal historian who had never heard 
of Baque got the name changed to 
Bach. 

Lankey died, and a son-in-law 
carried on his efforts as a family 
trust. A subscription was launched 
to build a new hall for the New 
York Symphony, which now num- 
bered forty members. Interest 
spread like an avalanche, and a 
site was finally picked in Ohio, to 
be within easier commuting dis- 
tance of all parts of the North 
American continent. Beethoven 
Hall was erected, to seat forty thou- 
sand people. The first series of con- 
certs was fully subscribed forty- 
eight hours after tickets went on 
sale. 

Opera was given on visiscope for 
the first time in two hundred years. 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 


34 



An opera house was built on the 
Ohio site, and then an art institute. 
The Center grew, first by private 
subscription, and then under gov- 
ernment sponsorship. Lankey’s son- 
in-law died, and a nephew took 
over the management of Lankey’s 
— and the campaign to free Erlin 
Baque. Thirty years passed, and 
then forty. 

And forty-nine years, seven 
months and nineteen days after 
Baque received his life sentence, he 
was paroled. He still owned a third 
interest in Manhattan’s most pros- 
perous restaurant, and the profits 
that had piled up over the years 
made him a wealthy man. He was 
ninety-six years old. 

Another capacity crowd at Bee- 
thoven Hall. Vacationists from all 
parts of the Solar System, music 
lovers who commuted for the con- 
certs, old people who had retired to 
the Center, forty-thousand of them, 
stirred restlessly and searched the 
wings for the conductor. Applause 
thundered down from the twelve 
balconies as he strode forward. 

Erlin Baque sat in his permanent 
seat at the rear of the main floor. 
He adjusted his binoculars and 
peered at the orchestra, wondering 


again what a contrabassoon sound- 
ed like. His bitterness he had left 
behind on Ganymede. His life at 
the Center was an unending reve- 
lation of miracles. 

Of course no one remembered 
Erling Baque, tunesmith and mur- 
derer. Whole generations of people 
could not even remember the Corns. 
And yet Baque felt that he had ac- 
complished all this, just as surely 
as if he had built this building — 
built the Center — with his own 
hands. He spread his hands before 
him, hands deformed by the years 
in the rock pits, fingers and tips of 
fingers crushed off, his body 
maimed by cascading rocks. He had 
no regrets. He had done his work 
well. 

Two ushers stood in the aisle be- 
hind him. One jerked a thumb in 
his direction, and whispered, “Now 
there’s a character for you. Comes 
to every concert. Never misses one. 
And he just sits there in the back 
row watching people. They say he 
was one of the old tunesmiths, years 
and years ago.” 

“Maybe he likes music,” the 
other said. 

“Naw. Those old tunesmiths 
never knew anything about music. 
Besides — he’s deaf.” END

he wanted; and after that to enjoy it. But to achieve the one 


he’d have to give up the other . or would he?

VICTORY 


The transport ship, bound for Capella with Outlander 
colonists from Earth and Frontier Guards from Arcturus, 
struck the hyperspace vortex without warning. It seized 
her, wrenching and twisting her, and flung her across its 
gigantic rim at thousands of times the speed of light. She 
emerged into normal space in an unknown region of the 
galaxy, broken and driveless, but near enough a planet that 
she could descend by means of her antigravity plates before 
the last of her air was gone. 

It was sunset when she settled heavily to earth on a 
grassy slope beside a forest, leaning at a dangerous angle 
with only her failing antigravity plates to hold her from 
falling. The dead had been disposed of in space and the 
living filed out of her: fifty Outlander men, women and 
children, eighteen ship's crewmen, and ten Frontier Guards. 

The Guard officer and ship's captain came last, of equal 
rank and already appraising each other with cold specula- 
tion. 


37 



T HE HOWLING things in the 
dark forest were coming 
closer. Thane listened as he 
watched Gurry, the ship’s captain, 
approach across the strip of land 
that separated the two camps ; 
standing back from his fire as he 
waited, where he would make an 
uncertain target for an assassin’s 
blaster. 

No one could be seen near any 
of the fires in the two camps on the 
hill. Only the unarmed Outlanders, 
at their fires in the swale below, 
moved about without wariness. And 
it was not yet three hours from 
the landing of the ship. 

Curry stopped before him, re- 
strained anger on his arrogantly 
handsome face. 

“You failed to report to me and 
turn your Frontier Guards over 
to my command as you were 
ordered,” he said. 

“Since your rank is no higher 
than mine I saw no reason to do 
so,” Thane answered. 

Gurry smiled, very thinly. “Per- 
haps I can show you a reason.” 
“Perhaps. Let’s have it” 

“First, I want to remind you of 
our circumstances,” Curry said. 
“The ship will never lift again and 
we’re marooned here for centuries 
to come. You know what the re- 
action of the Outlanders will be.” 
The Outlanders were the outcasts 
of a society that could not tolerate 
individuality. Two hundred years 
before the complexities of civiliza- 
tion had combined technocracy 
with integration and produced 
, Technogration. Technogration had 
abolished race, creed and color, 
nations and borders, had welded all 


into a common mass and prohibited 
all individual pursuits that did not 
contribute to the Common Good. 
The Outlanders, refusing to come 
under Technograte domination, 
lived as best they could in the 
deserts, plateaus and jungles that 
Technogration could not use. The 
ones on the ship had been bound 
for Capella Five where men accus- 
tomed to wrestling a living from 
hostile environments were needed. 
Under such circumstances Out- 
landers were given certain rights 
and freedoms. Until they were no 
longer needed. Then, again, they 
became a people without a 
world . 

“For two hundred years the Out- 
landers have hated Technogration 
and wanted a world where they 
could set up their own archaic 
form of society,” Curry said. “Now, 
those down there will think their 
millenium has arrived and they 
can refuse to recognize Techno- 
grate authority.” 

“I see,” Thane said. “And you 
want my cooperation so that Tech- 
nogration won’t fall by the way- 
side?” 

“Your willingness to accept a 
subordinate position would give 
me an intact force of both crew- 
men and Guardsmen.” Curry’s 
lips thinned. “But there will be 
Technogration, with or without 
your support. There will be no 
retrogression back into the Out- 
landers’ hallowed Dark Ages.” 

“There is no argument — we both 
want Technogration,” Thane said. 
“We only disagree over who should 
be in command.” 

“There is a slight difference in 

TOM (GODWIN

our qualifications. Your present 
rank was gained by your ability to 
kill and not by loyalty to Techno- 
gration.” 

“Yes, of course,” Thane agreed. 
“We’ll say that I’m a materialistic 
opportunist while you’re a noble 
idealist. But it’s still the same iden- 
tical whip that we’re both going 
to reach for.” 

“As I said, I would prefer a 
peaceful transfer of your Guards- 
men to my command. But my crew- 
men outnumber them almost two 
to one and they are expendable if 
necessary.” The thin smile came 
back, almost mocking in its con- 
fidence. “You haven’t much choice 
but to cooperate and accept a sub- 
ordinate role, have you?” 

The subordinate role would be 
very brief; it would end with a 
blaster beam in the back as soon 
as the Guardsmen were transferred 
to Curry’s command . • 

“Try again, Curry. I can’t bite 
on that one.” 

The smile faded from Curry’s 
face, leaving it icily cold. “That 
was the only opportunity you’ll 
ever get.” 

The howling sounded again in 
the forest and Thane said: 

“We understand each other, 
now. But the Outlanders are un- 
armed and it may require our full 
forces to hold off whatever is out 
there. I suggest a truce until morn- 

The iciness remained on Curry’s 
face and he did not reply at once. 
“Perhaps you are right. You will 
order your men to observe a truce 
for the rest of the night.” 

He turned back to his camp. 

THE LAST VICTORY 


Thane made the rounds where 
his guards patrolled with their 
searchlights probing out into the 
darkness. All of Curry’s men but 
two had been added to reinforce 
the guard ring around the Out- 
lander camp; most of the crew- 
men along the east and south lines, 
leaving the more experienced 
Guardsmen to patrol the two lines 
facing the forest. 

Guardsmen and crewmen pa- 
trolled in silence, watching one an- 
other with the calculating regard 
of men who knew they might soon 
be ordered to kill one another. Ap- 
parently it was obvious to all of 
them that two officers of equal rank 
was a situation that could not for 
long exist. 

His return to his camp took him 
through the scattered camp fires 
of the Outlanders. There were not 
many men to be seen; most of the 
survivors were women and chil- 
dren whom the Outlander leader 
had ordered into the safer inner 
compartments when the ship began 
breaking up. 

Thane met him at the second 
fire; a gaunt old man with a jut- 
ting gray beard and sharp blue eyes 
under bristling gray brows. He 
stepped out from the fire and 
spoke : 

“Captain Thane — I’d like to 
ask a question.” 

Thane stopped. “What is it?” 

“My name is Paul Kennedy 
and I speak for all of us,” the old 
man said. “Captain Curry has 
locked up all arms from us — he’s 
already starting the regimentation 
for a permanent Technograte 
colony here and making sure we 

39 



can’t object. For two hundred 
years Technogration has failed on 
Earth except to turn men into ro- 
bots. Here we could have a new 
chance and live like humans 
again.” 

^ “The question,” Thane reminded 
him. 

“You were in the Frontier 
Guards, where men still have to 
think for themselves to survive, 
and we were hoping you would 
understand why we don’t want to 
start another ant hill here.” 

He could understand — but now, 
after thirty years of planning and 
fighting, he was only one step from 
the top. 

“There will be Technogration,” 
he said. 

“We thought you would say 
that.” Kennedy’s expression did 
not change. “We hoped we would 
be wrong.” 

An ecstatic yelping sounded sud- 
denly from nearby and something 
brown and white raced across the 
firelit ground with a laughing boy 
in pursuit. Thane stared. 

It was a dog. 

He had not seen one for thirty 
years. Technogration prohibited 
the owning of pets as an unneces- 
sary drain upon the planned econ- 
omy and as non-contributive to 
the Common Good. 

“We knew about the regula- 
tions,” Kennedy said, “but children 
need pets to love and be loved by. 
She’s going to have pups — only 
she and Lornie’s kitten were left.” 
The old man’s eyes watched him 
closely, questioningly. “Surely, no 
one will object to them?” 

The dog circled back and a dark 


haired young woman beyond an- 
other fire called to it: “Binkie — 
come here!” 

The dog obeyed, its tail drooping 
a little, and the woman looked un- 
certainly in Thane’s direction be- 
fore she disappeared back in the 
shadows, the dog close behind her. 
The boy followed, asking, “Why 
did you stop us, Blanche?” 

Thane watched them go, the 
sight of the boy and dog bringing 
back with unwanted vividness the 
memory of another Outlander boy 
who had played with his dog, long 
ago; bringing back the past that 
necessity had forced him to for- 
get .. 

He put the dangerous weakness 
from his mind and spoke to Ken- 
nedy: 

“You Outlanders were bound for 
a Technograte world when you 
left Earth. You now stand on a 
Technograte world. You will do 
as you are ordered to do. As for 
your pets — you may have as many 
as you want so far as I’m con- 
cerned.” 

He stepped past Kennedy and 
continued on through the camp. 
The conversation of the Outlanders 
froze as he drew near, letting him 
walk in a little sea of silence that 
moved along with him. It was the 
usual reaction to the presence of a 
Technograte officer. 

A little girl was out beyond the 
last fire; her back turned to him 
as she knelt in the grass and worked 
at something. He came closer and 
saw she was trying to tie a white 
cord around the neck of a half 
grown kitten. It sat with resigned 
patience as she struggled with ear- 

TOM GODWIN 


40 



nest, inexperienced fingers to tie 
a knot that would not fall apart. 
She was talking to it as she 
worked: 

“ — and maybe the things in the 
forest kill cats. So you’ll have to 
stay tied up, Tommy, and close to 
me because you’re the only kitten 
on this whole world — ” 

His shadow fell across her and 
she looked up. Black curls framed 
a startled little face and gray eyes 
went wide at the sight of his uni- 
form. She seized the surprised kit- 
ten and held it protectively in her 
arms, the knot falling apart again 
on the ground. 

“Please — Tommy won’t ever 
hurt anything — ” 

Two women and a man were 
watching him from beyond the fire 
with frozen-faced hatred. Techno- 
grate regulations required the im- 
mediate killing of any animals 
found smuggled aboard a ship . 

“I won’t harm your kitten,” he 
said He smiled sardonically at the 
Outlanders beyond the fire. “My 
horns aren’t quite that long yet.” 

H E MET Curry when he was al- 
most back to his camp. Curry 
had two bodyguards with him and 
passed without speaking. 

The hours went by and the night 
was like a cold October night on 
Earth but for the strange constella- 
tions that crept across the sky. The 
Outlander fires burned lower and 
the things in the forest became si- 
lent, as though massing for a sur- 
prise attack. Twice the wind 
shifted, to bring the scents from 
the forest, and each time he heard 

THE LAST VICTORY 


the dog growl uneasily while the 
woman tried to quiet her. 

He was going down the south 
guard line, the western horizon 
touched with the light of coming 
moonrise, when the monsters at- 
tacked the north line. 

They broke suddenly from the 
forest with a demoniac howl of 
command from their leader, a boil- 
ing wave of them. They were green, 
hard to see against the green grass, 
racing low to the ground like giant 
tigers, their long, serpentine necks 
thrust forward and eyes blazing yel- 
low in hyena faces. 

The blaster fire of the Guards- 
men met them, pale blue beams 
that blossomed into brief incan- 
descence when they struck. Curry’s 
guards added their fire, their reac- 
tions slower than those of the 
Guardsmen. The guards along the 
other three lines turned to help 
halt the attack, the south line 
guards firing across the Outlander 
camp. 

The front rank of monsters went 
down, with them the leader. For 
an instant the onslaught slowed, 
leaderless and uncertain, then the 
monster that had been behind the 
leader gave the commanding howl 
and the others surged ahead again. 

At that moment, when the at- 
tention of every guard in every 
guard line was on the north perim- 
eter attack, the Outlander dog 
broke loose from whoever had been 
holding her. She ignored the attack 
from the north and was a blur as 
she went through the south guard 
line, screaming a snarl of warning 
and her leash whipping in the air 
behind her. She vanished behind 


41 



the guard line and Thane swung 
his searchlight. 

Five monsters were almost upon 
the backs of the unsuspecting 
guards, charging without sound. 

His blaster beam raked at them 
and two went down. The others 
struck three guards with their 
bodies, knocking them to the 
ground before they could fire. Then 
the monsters passed on, to . lurch 
a dozen steps and fall limply to 
the ground. They did not even 
twitch after they fell. 

He saw, when he reached the 
first one, that it was dead. So were 
the other two. 

Yet there was not a blaster 
mark on them. 

Then he saw another thing. One 
of the monsters had fallen with its 
jaws slackly open and its teeth 
were visible. They were blunt and 
even. 

Despite their ferocious appear- 
ance, the monsters were only her- 
bivores. 

The three fallen guards were 
getting to their feet, apparently 
unharmed. Along the north perim- 
eter the attack was over as sud- 
denly as it had begun; the leader 
of the monsters lying dead against 
the guard line and all the others 
still alive fleeing wildly back into 
the forest. Quiet came, broken 
only by the growling of the dog 
out near the two monsters Thane 
had killed. 

He turned his light on her, then 
went closer to make sure he had 
seen rightly. 

She was fighting something on 
the ground, green-eyed with fury 
as she ripped and tore at it. But 


there was nothing there. Nothing. 

ct Binkier 

The dark haired woman was 
coming toward them, wraithlike 
in a white sleeping garment. The 
dog turned away, with a last rip 
at the nothing it fought, and saw 
the three guards the monsters had 
knocked down. She froze, like as 
though she saw something she could 
not believe. 

Then, deadly with menace, a 
growl vibrated in her throat and 
she crouched to attack them. 

“Binkie — don’t!” The voice of 
the girl was shrill with urgency. 
“Come here — come here!” 

The dog hesitated, then obeyed; 
going past the guards in a swift 
lope, her head turned to watch 
them and her teeth bared in a snarl. 
The girl seized the leash and girl 
and dog disappeared back into the 
Outlander camp, both of them 
running. 

Curry loomed out of the dark- 
ness, his two bodyguards with him, 
and flashed his light over the fall- 
en monsters. 

“So you let three get through?” 
he said. He glanced to the north 
guard line where the searchlights 
of the guards showed only the 
dark, lifeless edge of the forest. 
“But no one was harmed and 
there’s no indication that they 
are going to attack again.” 

He regarded Thane with cold 
thoughtfulness. “Apparently the 
camp is in no danger, after all.” 

To Thane the implication of his 
words was obvious : if the monsters 
were not a menace his cooperation 
was no longer needed by Curry. 
The three guards were Curry 

TOM GODWIN 


42 



men and Curry had two with him. 
He was outnumbered six to one . 

“Sir—” 

It was one of the three guards; 
Bellam, the ship’s pharmacist. He 
hurried up to Curry, the other two 
close behind him. 

Curry swung on him, impatient- 
ly. “What is it?” 

“We must combine our forces 
to fight a new danger. This camp 
is infected with rabies.” 

“Rabies?” 

“Yes, sir,” Bellam answered. 
“The Outlander’s dog had a con- 
vulsion beyond the guard line and 
then almost attacked the three of 
us. That dog is mad.” 

“How do you know it was a con- 
vulsion?” Thane asked. 

“You saw it, yourself,” Bellam 
answered. 

He turned his head to face 
Thane as he spoke and Thane saw 
his eyes for the first time. 

They were the lifeless, staring 
eyes of a dead man. 

He flicked his light over the 
faces of the other two guards. They 
were the same; all three were like 
walking dead. 

“Did the monsters harm you?” 
he asked Bellam. 

Bellam hesitated, seeming to 
tense with suspicion. “No.” The 
dead eyes stared into his. “What 
makes you ask?” 

He saw that Curry had noticed 
nothing different about the three 
guards. It was typical of Curry; 
to him subordinates were only auto- 
matons to carry out his orders. 

“We were discussing a mad dog, 
Thane,” Curry said. “Not the 
health of my men.” He spoke to 

THE LAST VICTORY 


Bellam. “As I recall, rabies was 
a pre-Technogration plague, often 
fatal.” 

“The bite of a rabid animal is 
invariably fatal, the death pro- 
longed and painful,” Bellam said. 
“There is no preventative or cure 
among the medical supplies on the 
ship. The dog must be killed at 
once, together with all other ani- 
mals in the Outlander camp.” 

“If the dog was mad, why hasn’t 
it bitten any of the Outlanders,” 
Thane asked Curry. “I suggest we 
keep it on a leash until until we 
know for sure.” 

“The dog was smuggled aboard 
the ship in defiance of regulations,” 
Curry said. “It would have been 
destroyed before had I known about 
it.” 

He turned to Bellam, ignoring 
Thane. “The three of you will 
search the Outlander camp from 
end to end. Kill all animals and re- 
port to me the names of the 
owners.” 

The three departed, to begin 
the search at the nearer end of the 
camp. Thane made no further ob- 
jection. He knew the Outlanders 
well enough to know that they 
would have overheard the discus- 
sion on the hill and slipped the 
dog out through the guard lines be- 
fore that discussion ended. Out- 
landers could be very clever in 
such matters — the searchers would 
find no dog. 

There was satisfaction on Curry’s 
face as he turned and with his two 
bodyguards started back up the 
hill to his camp. Thane watched 
him go, smiling a little. Curry was 
making the mistake that had been 


43 



fatal for so many before him; he 
was taking it for granted too soon 
that he had won. 

A man came hurrying from the 
north guard line before Gurry had 
gone far. He called to Curry: 

“Sir, there is something you 
ought to know — 55 

Thane saw, with almost disbelief, 
that it was one of his own men: 
Gorman. 

Curry waited and when Gorman 
reached him he said: 

“When I was helping inspect the 
Outlander section of the ship for 
hidden weapons this evening I 
saw some small animals in storage 
compartment Thirteen. I think 
they were very young kittens. I 
would like to volunteer to go and 
kill them.” 

Curry said something that a va- 
grant breeze made inaudible then 
his words came clear: 

“ — I’ll send a detail to the ship 
as soon as the camp is searched. 
You will report to my guards now 
for orders and help them hunt for 
the dog.” 

Gorman started back to meet the 
guards and Curry stood for a little 
while before he went on his way. 
Thane could imagine his feeling 
of pleased surprise and triumph. 

Thane called to Gorman as he 
passed some distance in front of 
him. 

“Were you injured in the at- 
tack?” he asked. 

“No,” Gorman said. Then, with 
the same tense suspicion that Bel- 
lam had had he asked the same 
question: “Why do you ask?” 
“Why did you report to Curry 
instead of me?” 

44 


The answer came quickly, me- 
chanically, “The animals are in his 
ship and they must be killed. They 
may be mad.” 

“Go help Curry’s men,” he said 
and watched Gorman go, trying to 
fit together the incidents that did 
not make sense. 

Herbivores had attacked with- 
out reason. There had fallen dead, 
without a blaster mark on them. 
The Outlander dog had fought 
nothing and almost attacked the 
guards. One of his own men had 
gone over to the other side. And 
there was a sudden strange urgency 
to kill all animals in camp. 

There was nothing he could do 
for the time being but wait for 
further developments so he waited. 
The moon came up, so swift in its 
retrograde orbit that its speed was 
visible and so near that it had the 
brilliance of a dozen Earth moons. 
When it had lifted clear of the hori- 
zon it flooded the land with a cold 
silver light that made the search- 
lights of the guards unnecessary 
and revealed the camp with metal- 
lic light-and-shadow clarity. 

The search party was halfway 
through the camp, Gorman with 
them and Bellam in command. 
They were ransacking the posses- 
sions and temporary shelters of the 
Outlanders with swift efficiency, 
ignoring the protests of the women 
and their blasters leveled warningly 
on the men. 

They found the little girl. 

She was carrying her kitten 
ahead of them, a small, silent 
shadow in the moonlight, when 
Gorman saw her. He spoke to Bel- 
lam and Bellam’s head jerked up. 

TOM GODWIN 



Then the two of them advanced 
on her. 

She tried to run when she re- 
alized they had seen the kitten, 
hugging it in her arms with the 
white cord trailing behind her. Bel- 
larn overtook her and caught her 
by the shoulder, jerking her to a 
halt. He tore the kitten from her 
arms and flung it hard to the 
ground. It made a thin little scream 
of pain and the girl fought to reach 
it, her cry sobbing and frantic : 

“Don’t hurt him — ” 

Gorman’s blaster hissed and blue 
flame leaped from it. Incandescence 
enveloped the kitten and then there 
was nothing where it had been but 
a small black hole in the ground. 

Bellam and Gorman wheeled 
back, like mechanical men, to re- 
sume the search. The girl stood a 
moment, staring before her, saying 
something very low that sounded 
like, “Tommy . Tommy . .” 
Then she stumbled to the little 
black hole and dropped to her 
knees beside it as though she hoped 
that somehow she might still find 
her kitten there. 

He looked away, strangely dis- 
turbed. He drummed his fingers 
restlessly on the butt of his hol- 
stered blaster then he turned again 
to go down into the Outlander 
camp. 

The moon was up and it was 
time he found the dog. Something 
had come out of the night with 
the monsters and perhaps she 
could tell him what it was. He 
could not yet believe she was mad. 

The dark haired woman stood by 
the fire, watching the little girl 

THE LAST VICTORY 


and the searchers with bitter, 
smouldering hatred. She faced him, 
her breath coming fast in her 
anger. 

“Her parents and her brother — 
when the ship broke up — she lost 
them all. Only her kitten was left 
to her.” 

“Where is the dog?” he asked. 

“Find her!” 

“The dog — where is she?” 

“Find her,” she challenged again. 
“Find her and kill her — if you 
can!” 

He stepped past her and went 
on his way. She had told him what 
he wanted to know: despite her 
attempts not to do so she had been 
unable to keep from glancing 
toward the ship. 

H IS ROUTE took him by the 
little girl. She was standing 
by the hole, small and bare- 
footed in the grass, her hands hold- 
ing the white cord that was black 
and charred on one end. She was 
crying, silently, as though too proud 
to let him see her break. 

After he had passed her the 
vision went with him for a little 
way; the terrible, helpless hatred 
and hurt in her eyes and the moon- 
light gleaming coldly on her tears. 

He looked back when he reached 
the ship. Gorman was coming, 
running, and the other three were 
turning back from the far end of 
the camp to hurry after Gorman. 

He looked toward Curry’s camp 
and saw Curry watching him. Cur- 
ry and his men moved toward him 
and there were six to make a 
rendezvous with him. 


45 



The truce was over. 

He found the dog behind the 
farthest tail fin, leashed to a thorny 
bush and almost invisible in the 
shadows. 

She watched him as he stopped 
before her, her ears forward ques- 
tioningly and her tail moving a little 
with tentative friendliness. He spoke 
to her and her reply was a low bark, 
her tail whipping with delight. She 
thought he had come to release 
her . 

He had known dogs well as a 
boy and he knew the one before 
him was not mad. 

He heard Gorman’s feet plod- 
ding fast through the grass and 
he waited with his blaster in his 
hand. 

Gorman came around the tail 
fin, panting, his own blaster in his 
hand. The dog went rigid at the 
sight of him, the growl in her 
throat, and Gorman’s blaster swung 
toward her. 

“Hold it !” he ordered. 

Gorman paused, and the dead 
eyes looked into his. “There the 
mad dog is — we must kill it.” 

“We can kill it later if it’s mad. 
We’ll watch it a while, first.” 

The suspicion became like some- 
thing almost tangible about Gor- 
man and his blaster started the 
first movement toward Thane. 
“Why?” 

“I think it can see something — ” 

Gorman fired, so swiftly that 
he felt the heat of the beam even 
though he had been expecting it. 
He shot for the heart and Gorman 
collapsed before he could fire 
again. He lay still on the ground, 
the eyes that stared up into the 


sky no deader than when he had 
been alive. 

The dog was lunging against her 
leash, trying to get to him. Thane 
stepped closer and watched the 
grass beside Gorman’s head. A 
patch of it the size of his hand sud- 
denly bent down, as from an un- 
seen weight, and then something 
struck his knee. 

He slapped at it as it darted up 
his leg and knocked it off; some- 
thing that felt like a mass of cold, 
rubbery tentacles. He knew, then. 

He stepped back, his blaster 
swinging aimlessly. The thing 
would leap again, to reach his head 
as it had done with Gorman, and it 
was invisible. There was nothing 
but the moonlit grass to be seen. 
Perhaps it was behind him, already 
preparing to spring . 

The dog’s snarling was a frenzied 
scream as she fought against her 
leash. He swung his blaster and its 
blue beam cut the leash in two. 

She flashed toward him, then up, 
her ears laid back, her eyes blazing 
slits and her teeth slashing at his 
throat. His blaster was in line with 
her chest and for a brief instant he 
had only to press the firing stud. 

He did something he had not 
done for thirty years ; he trusted his 
life to another being and did not 
fire. 

Cold tentacles whipped against 
his face and her teeth closed to- 
gether beside his cheek with a 
vicious snap and gust of hot 
breath. She rebounded and held 
the thing on the ground between 
her paws as she tore at it; gagging 
a little, whining and snarling in 
fury and triumph. 


46 


TOM GODWIN 



He squatted beside her and laid 
his hand on her, speaking to her 
soothingly. She calmed a little, 
though her chest still pounded with 
the beating of her heart, and he 
saw the thing she had killed. 

It was dead and slowly becoming 
visible as it changed to a color like 
pale milk. It resembled a huge, 
hairless spider. 

It was a parasite; a highly intel- 
ligent parasite that could take over 
the mind of its host as well as the 
body. The parasites had had only 
the forest monsters as hosts, before, 
but with the coming of the humans 
they had the opportunity for hosts 
of a far higher order. They pos- 
sessed a means of locomotion but 
apparently it was limited in its 
duration or else they would not 
have needed to control the leaders 
of the monster bands and stage 
the attack that would carry them 
to the guard lines. 

The dog, with the acute sixth 
sense of some animals, could sense 
the hostile alienness of the things. 
She could see them — apparently 
the vision range of dogs went a lit- 
tle farther beyond that of humans. 
So also would that of cats but the 
kitten had had no chance to show 
by its actions what it had seen. 

The dog had hated the changed 
men because they were alien things, 
no longer human. The thing that 
had been Bellam had used the 
knowledge stored in Bellam’s mind 
to claim there was rabies in the 
camp and thereby enlist the support 
of the humans in killing their only 
means of detecting the parasites. 

There was a pounding of feet be- 
THE LAST VICTORY 


yond the ship as the zombies came. 
On the slope above him Curry was 
striding toward him, his bodyguards 
flanking him and the moonlight 
bright on his face. 

He stood with the dog beside 
him and watched them come to kill 
him. Only he and the dog knew of 
the parasites; if they were killed 
the way would be open for the 
parasites to infiltrate the camp. In 
the end the new world would hold 
only the walking dead, down to the 
last Outlander child. 

“Curry, ” he called. 

He did not have to speak loudly 
in the still night air for Curry to 
hear him but Curry came on, his 
face hard, arrogant metal in the 
moonlight. 

“Give me one minute, Curry, to 
tell you what I found.” 

Curry’s reply was the order to his 
men. 

“The dog is with him. Kill them 
both.” 

His blaster swung up as he spoke. 

Thane dropped, firing as he went 
down. Curry’s arrogant face dis- 
solved into nothing and his blaster 
flamed aimlessly into the ground at 
his feet. The blaster of the swiftest 
guard sent its beam hissing like a 
snake over Thane’s head, then he 
went down as Curry had done, the 
other guard falling beside him with 
his first and only shot licking off 
into the moonlight. 

Then the zombies came around 
the tail fin, in a quick rush with 
their dead eyes staring and their 
blasters making a curtain of blue 
fire before them. 

The dog lunged at them and a 
blaster beam dipped down to meet 

47 



her, Bellam — his headless body was 
falling forward as Thane killed the 
zombie beside him. The blaster of 
the third one ripped its beam like 
a white-hot iron along Thane’s ribs 
as he died. Then, within two heart- 
beats, it was over and the night was 
quiet again. 

He returned his blaster to its hol- 
ster. The dog was limping from one 
zombie to the other, searching for 
parasites, her shoulder red with 
blood and staining the grass. 

She found none and he called her 
to him to look at her shoulder. It 
was not a serious wound but it was 
painful and bleeding fast and 
should be cared for. He took her 
around the ship, where the Out- 
lander camp lay in view below. He 
looked again at the wound and she 
whimpered a little from the pain, 
gentle though his touch had been, 
then licked his hand in quick 
apology. 

“Your job is over for now,” he 
said. He motioned toward the camp 
below, where the dark haired wom- 
an was waiting. “Home, girl — go 
home.” 

She left him and went running 
and limping down the hill where 
her hurts would be cared for. 

His side was burning and blood 
was like a warm, wet sheet down it. 
He made a temporary bandage of 
his shirt and then leaned wearily 
against the tail fin. 

It was all over. The nature of the 
parasites was known and everyone 
could be fitted with a thin metal 
helmet until they were completely 
eliminated. They did not seem to 
be numerous — apparently there had 


been no more than ten or twelve 
among the scores of monsters. The 
dog would watch, and warn them 
if any more were in the vicinity. 

It was all over, with Gurry a mo- 
tionless spot on the hillside above 
him and no one left to challenge 
him. He had come a long way from 
the Outlander boy on the high, cold 
prairie who had hated Technogra- 
tion. He had been nineteen before 
he finally realized the futility of 
hating the unassailable power of 
Technogration and realized he must 
accept it and adapt to it. And then 
carve out a niche for himself with 
a ruthlessness greater than any of 
those around him. So he had fought 
his way up, trampling those who 
would have trampled him had they 
been a little stronger, each step an- 
other victory in his conquest of the 
system that had condemned him. 

And now — the last victory. There 
was no one to challenge him; there 
could be no one under the rigid dis- 
cipline of Technogration. 

The last victory. The security of 
Power to the end of his life. 

That was Technogration. 

D awn touched the sk y , 

softening the moon’s hard 
light. As though the coming of day 
was a signal, the ship trembled and 
there was the whisper of dislodged 
soil as the tail fin lifted a fraction 
of an inch. The antigravity plates 
were almost exhausted — the ship 
would fall within minutes. 

Down in the Outlander camp 
the children were gathering around 
the dog as the dark haired woman 
bandaged her shoulder. A voice

TOM GODWIN 



came to him, treble and joyous, 
“Binkie is back — Binkie is back . .” 

The little girl sat to one side, so 
small and alone that he almost 
failed to see her. She watched the 
children crowd up to pet their dog 
but she did not move to join them. 
Only her hands moved, caressing 
the white cord that was charred on 
one end. 

He felt the triumph and satisfac- 
tion become like something turned 
bitter around the edges and drain- 
ing away. 

Technogration was planning and 
fighting and killing until at last a 
man reached the top and no one 
dared oppose him; Technogration 
was control of a world and the 
seeds of an empire. 

And Technogration was a child 
crying in the cold moonlight, was a 
little black hole where a kitten had 
screamed out with pain, with a lit- 
tle girl’s heart that had nothing left 
to hold but harsh and poignant 
memories and a piece of burnt cord. 

He ran to the boarding ramp, 
feeling the fiery lash of pain and 
hot flow of blood as the wound re- 
opened, telling himself he was a 
fool who would probably die in the 
falling ship and would deserve it. 

He stood by the gray ashes of his 
fire, the Guardsman’s combat hel- 
met under his arm, and watched 
the little girl come alone up the 
hill. Someone had washed the tear- 
stains from her face and she 
stopped before him with her head 
held high and defiant, trying not to 
let him see she was afraid of him 
and almost succeeding. 

“I sent for you, Lomie, to tell 

THE LAST VICTORY 


you I’m sorry about last night.” 

He saw she did not believe him. 
Her face was like a little carving of 
cold, unforgiving stone and she did 
not answer him. 

He set the helmet down in the 
grass before her. Six tiny kittens 
lay inside it, red and white and 
gray fluffs of fur, their pink mouths 
questing hungrily. 

Her eyes widened with incredul- 
ous wonder. 

“Oh!” 

Then the suspicion came back 
and she stopped the quick forward 
step she had taken. 

“They haven’t any mother and 
they’re hungry,” he said. 

She did not move. 

“They’re yours, Lornie. To 
keep.” 

“They’re — mine?” Then the 
doubt fled from her and she ran 
forward to gather them in her arms. 

He left her with her head bent 
down over the kittens in her lap, 
making soft little sounds of endear- 
ment to them, her face so radiant 
that there was no room left for hurt 
or hatred on it. 

Kennedy was coming, not yet 
knowing why he had been sum- 
moned nor that Technogration had 
died at dawn. He would not relin- 
quish all his authority, of course. 
And he would have to remember 
to tell Kennedy that they were go- 
ing to give him one of Binkie’s 
pups. 

The companionship of an under- 
standing dog might be comforting 
in the years to come, whenever he 
recalled the morning he had owned 
a world and a bare-footed girl had 
taken it away from him. END

This article , by an authority on the subject , reveals the folly 
of a recent proposal made by the United States 


to the United Nations. Read it carefully — 
and with concern for the future. 

WHY GUIDED MISSILES 
CAN NOT DE CONTROLLED 

BY “Y” 


N JANUARY 12th, 1957 the 
United Nations General As- 
sembly released a four-page memo- 
randum which had been presented 
to its Eleventh Session. The docu- 
ment bore the code number of 
A/C. 1/783, and was marked Agen- 
da Item 22 of the Eleventh Session, 
First Committee. On those four 
pages were contained proposals 
which called for “the prohibition 
of atomic, hydrogen, and other 
weapons of mass destruction . .” 


Submitted to the General Assem- 
bly by the United States of Amer- 
ica, this memorandum achieved 
distinction through its reference to 
weapons other than atomic and 
thermonuclear bombs. For the first 
time the United Nations was 
brought face to face with the ques- 
tion of intercontinental ballistic 
missiles and military satellites which 
were to orbit about the earth in ex- 
traterrestrial space. The specific 
wording of that proposal is vital to 



51 



every American citizen. If it is 
adopted and an attempt is made to 
carry it out, it may well be the in- 
vitation to future sudden disaster 
of a magnitude difficult to con- 
ceive. Here, verbatim, is the weap- 
ons-control proposal now under 
study by the United Nations: 

“Scientists in many nations are 
now proceeding with efforts to pro- 
pel objects through outer space and 
to travel in the distant areas beyond 
the earth’s atmospheric envelope. 
The scope of these programmes is 
variously indicated in the terms: 
‘earth satellites’, ‘intercontinental 
missiles’, ‘long-range unmanned 
weapons’, and ‘space platforms’. No 
one can now predict with certainty 
what will develop from man’s ex- 
cursion in this new field. But it is 
clear that if this advance into the 
unknown is to be a blessing rather 
than a curse the efforts of all na- 
tions in this field need to be brought 
within the purview of a reliable 
armaments control system. The 
United States proposes that the first 
step toward the objective of assur- 
ing that future developments in 
outer space would be devoted ex- 
clusively to peaceful and scientific 
purposes would be to bring the test- 
ing of such objects under interna- 
tional inspection and participa- 
tion ” 

The sentiments expressed in this 
proposal are highly appealing. At 
first glance they appear to contain 
the seeds of an international inspec- 
tion program which would guaran- 
tee us a freedom from sudden inter- 
continental missile attack. In one 


full swoop, it seems, we have dis- 
covered the panacea to rid us of the 
recurring nightmare of an unex- 
pected and a devastating ballistic 
missile bombardment. 

It’s a pretty sentiment, but it 
won’t work. It has a fallacious 
premise which might well escape 
the attention of the diplomat, but 
which is obvious immediately to the 
missile engineer. For the substance 
of the disarmament proposal — and 
the crux of its practicality — is that 
there exists a real and distinct dif- 
ference between a military missile 
and a scientific missile. 

This is not at all true. Funda- 
mentally, the rocket which carries 
1,000 pounds of instruments at a 
speed of 8,000 miles per hour to 
500 miles above the earth is the 
same as the rocket moving in a bal- 
listic trajectory which carries a 
1,000-pound atomic bomb at a 
speed of 8,000 miles per hour to a 
target 2,000 or 3,000 miles away. 

In the interest of scientific re- 
search, the rocket carries instru- 
ments along a vertical trajectory. 

In the interests of transforming a 
large city into a hideous radioactive 
wasteland, the instruments are re- 
placed with a bomb, and the rocket 
tilts from a vertical climb into a 
ballistic arc. 

This is the first, but not at aU the 
only glaring weakness in a proposal 
based upon “international inspec- 
tion”. I need not call upon future 
developments to prove this point: 
the familiar rockets of the past and 
of the present will suffice. 

The most obvious example, of 
course, is the German V-2 rocket. 
This was, from the start, a military 


52 



program which had as its ultimate 
goal a rocket to carry a ton of high 
explosives into cities 200 miles dis- 
tant. While this weapon degen- 
erated into an appalling military 
failure, it represented sheer tech- 
nological genius. 

With the war over and done 
with, the same military V-2 rocket 
had its warhead replaced with in- 
struments, and was used as a vehi- 
cle to further the cause of science. 

Now, let us turn the tables and 
consider a rocket designed from the 
outset as a research vehicle — the fa- 
miliar Viking. With only 37% of 
the power generated by the V-2’s 
motor, the slender Navy research 
rocket has carried nearly a thou- 
sand pounds of instruments 158 
miles into space, reaching a maxi- 
mum velocity of 4,300 miles per 
hour. Note that this speed is fully 
700 miles per hour greater than 
that achieved by the V-2, although 
the power available is far less than 
found in the former German mili- 
tary weapon. 

The Viking is a highly sophisti- 
cated vehicle. Its delicate control 
system which utilizes a three-axis 
gyroscope, a magnetic amplifier 
autopilot (robot brain), and a gim- 
baled motor, endows it with phe- 
nomenal control during its flight. It 
is stablized in pitch and yaw move- 
ments, and its tendency to roll can 
be fully controlled. Most important, 
its attitude in flight can be con- 
trolled after the rocket motor has 
ceased to fire. This is indispensable 
to any ballistic rocket of high ac- 
curracy for it means that the entire 
rocket (after fuel is exhausted), or 
a separated warhead, may be di- 

GUIDED MISSILES 


rected accurately to a target. Con- 
trol of the rocket, or warhead, is 
maintained during the descent from 
the peak of the trajectory above the 
atmosphere, and to a much finer 
degree as the rocket or warhead 
plunges through the thickening air 
toward its objective. 

Compared to the Viking, then, 
the V-2 was a crude Chinese fire 
arrow. The Viking has constant, 
full-time control. Once the V-2’s 
motor ceased firing it was an un- 
controllable empty shell tumbling 
haphazardly above the atmosphere. 

By replacing the instruments 
with an atomic bomb, the Viking 
rocket could be fired with devastat- 
ing accuracy into targets up to 300 
miles distant. 

But — isn’t it a research vehicle? 
A rocket dedicated to peaceful pur- 
suits? 

Of course it is ! It is also a highly 
effective military weapon, if we 
choose to use it as such. 

A parallel to the Viking may be 
found in the Army’s latest tactical 
weapon, the Redstone, developed 
by Dr. Wernher von Braun and his 
staff — the same people who de- 
veloped the V-2. It is most interest- 
ing to note that, like the Viking, the 
70-foot Redstone is controllable in 
movements of pitch, yaw, and roll. 
Even more pertinent is the fact that 
the warhead separates from the 
rocket shortly after the end of pow- 
ered flight and that, through the 
use of small jet reactors which 
bleed off compressed air (exacdy as 
in Viking) the warhead may be di- 
rected to a target with impressive 
accuracy. 

You can replace the Viking’s in- 

53 



struments with an atomic bomb 
warhead. 

You can replace the Redstone’s 
atomic bomb warhead with instru- 
ments. Both will perform the same 
mission — military or scientific. 

Let us discuss some other exam- 
ples. The Project Vanguard satellite 
rocket has barely eleven tons total 
weight, and is a highly-sophisticated 
vehicle which carries an instrument 
payload of some 22 pounds. With 
this payload, Vanguard will reach 
velocities in excess of 18,000 miles 
per hour. This is far greater — al- 
most twice as much — as that 
needed for a ballistic missile of in- 
tercontinental range. 

Note, however, that Vanguard is 
a minimum satellite effort. We 
could reduce its speed to 14,000 
miles per hour, and increase the 
payload (eliminating its role as a 
satellite, of course), or, we could 
eliminate the third stage altogether, 
and replace the weight of the third- 
stage solid-propellant rocket and 
the instrumented satellite with an 
atomic bomb equal to 250,000 tons 
high explosive force. And Van- 
guard enjoys a high degree of in- 
flight control. 

Yet, Vanguard is a purely scien- 
tific venture. It is also an intercon- 
tinental missile carrying a minimal 
atomic bomb. 

There can be no distinction be- 
tween the two — military and scien- 
tific — in respect to rockets. The only 
difference a missile enjoys is de- 
termined by the man who decides 
what its payload shall be — bomb or 
instruments. 


T HE NAVY’S secret Project 
Orbiter — which in 1954 called 
for a small satellite to be shot into 
an orbit at a speed between 17,000 
and 18,000 miles per hour, was a 
pure research effort, to be con- 
ducted by the Office of Naval Re- 
search. The first-stage booster 
rocket was the giant Redstone, a 
military weapon. The second stage 
was a cluster of Loki rockets — an- 
other military weapon. The third 
stage was a single Loki rocket — a 
military weapon. 

What was the distinction? Abso- 
lutely none — only the choice of 
payload distinguished the destroyer 
of a city from the scientific prober 
of outer space. 

The gist of the United States pro- 
posal to the United Nations is that 
a system of close inspection of the 
manufacture, testing, and firing of 
these large rockets, and of satellites 
which will lift hundreds and even 
thousands of pounds into orbits 
about the earth, will prevent the 
use of such rockets as weapons, by 
an intimate knowledge of their 
number, payload, and firing loca- 
tions. 

Let us examine the first premise 
— the manufacture and the number 
available of these rockets. It is obvi- 
ous that in nations so large and di- 
verse as the United States and the 
Soviet Union, large factories and 
even a complex of factories may be 
hidden from the eye of the public 
or, for that matter, from interna- 
tional inspection groups. No better 
example, of this is provided than in 
the monumental effort of the Man- 
hattan Project during World War 
II.

Further, a factory to produce 
rocket motors and shells is not the 
immense undertaking which charac- 
terized the development and manu- 
facture of the first crude atomic 
weapons. Motors may be produced 
in small plants, rocket shells and 
fuel tanks by any automotive or 
marine industry, instruments by 
any one of thousands of factories. 
The static testing of these devices 
may be accomplished far from 
civilized centers in the strictest 
secrecv. Indeed, an entire rocket in- 
dustry may be spread throughout 
the industrial nation which is the 
United States, and never be re- 
vealed. 

The same applies, of course, to 
the Soviet Union. 

But even this subterfuge is totally 
unnecessary! For the research 
rocket to lift 500 pounds into an 
orbit is an intercontinental ballistic 
missile! The rocket to carry 2,000 
pounds to a height of 800 miles is 
an intermediate range ballistic mis- 
sile! 

The problem of payload substitu- 
tion is no barrier. No inspection 
team can possibly keep track of 
every large rocket, or even of the 
thousands of rockets scattered 
around the land. It’s simply too 
easy to keep the rockets from the 
sight of even an inspection team. 

What about launching sites? The 
long-range missiles may be fired 
from virtually anywhere . Moun- 
tains, deserts, open fields, deep for- 
ests, ships at sea, submarines — any 
location will do. The United States 
is incredibly large; many parts of 
our country to this day have never 
been explored. The trackless ex- 


panse of Canada can swallow 
vast missile facilities — “research 
rockets,” if you will. 

In essence, then, any inspection 
program can be reduced to useless- 
ness by any nation which chooses 
not to reveal its intentions to em- 
ploy large rockets for military pur- 
poses. 

The latest advances in solid-pro- 
pellant rockets only makes more 
critical the problem of discovering 
a well-planned move to blanket an 
enemy country within the span of a 
few hours with hydrogen bomb-car- 
rying missiles. Any massive attack 
which uses the liquid-propellant 
rocket suffers a logistical problem of 
sorts in supplying the vast quantities 
of unstable fuel to fire those rockets. 
Of course, the production of these 
elements can be (and has been) 
established at remote locations, but 
it still presents a major inconven- 
ience to a firing program. 

What of solid-propellant rockets 
— great canisters of plastics and 
chemicals? Obviously these sources 
of power in their latest form more 
than suffice to meet the needs of in- 
termediate and intercontinental 
range bombardment. The Navy’s 
latest missile weapon, the Polaris , 
is nothing more than an oversized 
booster rocket using a solid-propel- 
lant fuel! And Polaris has a range 
greater than 1,500 miles — which 
can be increased at any time simply 
by increasing the size of the chem- 
ical/plastic firing charge. 

The power and versatility of the 
new solid-propellant charges are in- 
credible. They represent a major 
break-through in missile tech- 
nology. The giant Redstone is pow- 


GUIDED MISSILES 


55 



ered with a 75,000 lb. thrust liquid- 
propellant motor which bums for 
90 seconds. Today, however, there 
are solid-propellant charges which 
generate 1,000,000 lbs. thrust — 
more than the combined power of 
13 Redstone rockets! 

Moreover, the new solid-propel- 
lant charges are insensitive to tem- 
peratures; they may be fired in ex- 
treme heat or in extreme cold. They 
can generate their fantastic thrust 
for as great a duration as 300 sec- 
onds — compare this to the Red- 
stone’s firing time of 90 seconds! 

They can be stored for long pe- 
riods of time. They can be fired 
from the simplest of launchers, any- 
where. They can be disguised with 
the greatest of ease. Their simplic- 
ity of manufacture, shipment, and 
storage; their ease of firing; their 
newly-acquired high degree of con- 
trollability; and their enormous 
performance and high payloads — 
render an inspection program vir- 
tually worthless. 

No number of inspection teams, 
with all their probing and prying, 
could uncover a well-concealed and 
determined plan to fire hundreds, 
or even thousands, of these missiles. 
They could destroy a nation over- 
night. 

(Another factor, which is ig- 
nored, involves the human being. 
How extensive a prying search 
would our people voluntarily sub- 
mit themselves to? How long would 
they suffer the indignity of repre- 
sentatives from, let us say, Russia, 
Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, 
Argentina, probing into their af- 
fairs? For such inspection to be re- 
liable, thousands of men would 


have to swarm about the nation 
looking into every conceivable 
facet of our industrial and personal 
lives! I know I wouldn’t like it!) 

The fallacies of the inspection 
program are evident. Imagine, 
then, the precarious — the fatal — 
position in which our nation would 
be placed, were we to rely for our 
very existence upon the effective- 
ness of such an inspection scheme. 
Mutual arms inspection in this day 
and age, with the new heights of 
missile and weapons science already 
reached, is a premise which bodes 
only disaster. 

It contains not the slightest as- 
surance of safety. Would you base 
the lives of your family and friends 
upon an assurance that our inspec- 
tion teams had been able to search 
every nook and cranny of the vast 
land of the U.S.S.R., its satellites, 
the Siberian wastes, the Polar re- 
gions? How could any of us place 
ourselves in so untenable a posi- 
tion! 

Such inspection affords us no 
protection from the placement by 
saboteurs of atomic bombs in all 
our critical cities and industries. 
Nuclear weapons are small gadgets 
nowadays; they will fit into an 
overnight bag, into a typewriter 
case, into a bowling ball container. 
Sealed tight by the lightest of metal 
shields, they no longer emit pene- 
trating radiation which can be de- 
tected by radiological instruments. 
They can be placed anywhere — 
and only a screwdriver to pry open 
the carrying container, which can 
be disguised in any imaginable 
form, will divulge the nature of the 
contents.

In preparing this report for IF 
magazine, I discussed this matter 
with several of my engineering col- 
leagues. We deal in rockets. We 
know them intimately. There is no 
situation which we would rather 
see than an effective program in 
being to protect us, and the entire 
world, from the threat of mass at- 
tack with rockets carrying atomic 
and hydrogen bombs. 

But we must, above all, be real- 
istic. If we are to rest our security 
upon the fallacious premise that an 
inspection and control program for 
rockets is effective, then we do no 
more than to openly court national 
suicide. This is bitter, inescapable 
truth. You cannot hide from the 
facts. Scientific rockets are inter- 
continental weapons. Long steel 
containers, disguised in a hundred 
ways, are intercontinental weapons. 

It is impossible to guarantee 
freedom from world violence 
through inspection teams prying 
into each other’s national cup- 
boards, by the same token that it 
is simple to use — upon short notice 
— the tools of science for the tools 
of war. 

I personally have no magic pan- 


acea for this dilemma which con- 
fronts us. I do not know the an- 
swer to world peace, and freedom 
from the appalling spectre of a 
savage hydrogen bomb war. But 
I do know that the hopes for peace 
which rest upon the inspection of 
facilities in each other’s lands is 
suicidal. 

In closing, I am reminded to 
leave you with the words I heard at 
the dedication of the Mount Palo- 
mar Observatory. These words 
ring with truth; they should never 
be forgotten: 

“There is no segment of knowl- 
edge , whether in the physical or the 
social sciences , whether in medicine 
or economics or astrophysics or an- 
thropology , which cannot ulti- 
mately he employed to the deter- 
rent of mankind if that is what we 
deliberately elect to do with it. 

“ Indeed , if the social sciences 
were developed as the physical 
sciences have been, we might have 
a weapon which, in unscrupulous 
hands, would be as deadly as the 
atomic bomb” 

.... and how do you control 
and inspect that? END

tall grass of the slopes, listening 
to the soft whistling of the wind; al- 
lowing the grass to caress my toga 
and thighs. It was a day soft and 
clear; a day accepted by the young, 
cherished by we old. Across the 
gently undulating hills stood the 
magnificent Melopolis, encradling 
the Oracle of Delni. I do not, of 
course, believe in the gods per se; 
still there is a grandeur in the very 
stones that transcends their human 





sculptors, and it is no wonder to me 
that many cling tenaciously, and ig- 
norantly, to the old religion. Cling 
to the gods of old, who drew man 
upward from wherever he began. 
In whose names Man killed and 
plundered, while struggling up. In 
whose names Man finally left this 
earth, to seek his cousins among the 
stars. 

But of course there were no 
cousins. There was nothing. And 
Man returned, and settled down to 
live. Saddened, but resigned and 
content to live in peace with his 
knowledge and his power. Gone 
now are all the ancient evils, wars, 
emergencies. 

“Sias! Sias — 55 And they were 
upon me. 

That is, Xeon was upon me. But 
I knew that where Xeon is, Melia 
must soon appear. And indeed it 
was but a moment before Melia 
slipped through the high grass to 
stand at his side. Their youthful 
voices were babbling in excitement. 

Melia was a She, with the swell- 
ing breasts that were, so tradition 
states, quite prevalent among mem- 
bers of the race long ago, and are 
seldom seen today. Indeed, Melia 
was on this account made the butt 
of many jokes and, I fear, would 
have had a lonely life of it had it 
not been for the friendship of 
Xeon. 

“Sias , 55 they were saying, “the 
Maternite’s gone . 55 

I stared in amazement. 

“Gone? It cannot be gone. It has 
always been — 55 

“Oh my gods!” Xeon shouted. “I 
tell you it’s gone! Will you — 55 

Melia interrupted him quietly. 

82 


“Xeon, will you lose all respect for 
the Elder ? 55 Then turned to me, 
and said calmly, “The watcher at 
the Maternite Machine, it appears, 
has been drunk. The heat rose 
above the warning, continued to 
rise, and then — poof. Everything 
has evaporated in Maternite. All 
the Prelife is gone . 55 

“All of it ? 55 I asked. 

“There is nothing left , 55 Melia 
insisted. “Can more be made? And 
if not, what will happen with no 
more children ? 55 

“That is for the priests to say, 
not I , 55 I replied. In moments of 
emergency, it is wise to speak with 
caution. That is, I suppose so. I 
have never before been in a real 
emergency. 

A man my age does not hurry in 
the heat of the midday sun — mad- 
dugs nenglishmin go out in the 
midday sun, as the ancients say, al- 
though I often wonder why — but 
Xeon and Melia ran all the way 
down to the city. They are of an 
age to enter manhood, and have all 
the energy such young men do. 

As we entered the city, we were 
surrounded by confusion and con- 
sternation. And can the simple peo- 
ple be blamed? They were aware 
that they stood in the midst of an 
unprecedented happening; indeed, 
an emergency. For a machine had 
failed! 

Not in the memory of the eldest 
among us has a machine failed. 
They were created so long ago, in- 
deed, that the ignorant believe 
them to have been constructed by 
the gods themselves. And never, so 
far as I know, has one failed. Small

wonder that the watcher had been 
negligent. Indeed, the watcher is 
more a tradition than a necessity. 
Besides, had he been sober, he 
would not have known what to do. 
For who knows the mysterious 
workings of the machines? 

I hastened to the City Hall and 
found the Conclave assembled, 
waiting for me to bring them to or- 
der. Xeon and Melia stopped as I 
mounted the steps, but I smiled and 
motioned them in. They accom- 
panied me past the marble pillars 
into the cool recesses of the Hall, 
then seated themselves on the floor 
as I took my place by the great 
table. 

Well, you know how these things 
are. At such a time, many men feel 
impelled to make speeches, and one 
must not be disrespectful. Prayers 
and supplications were offered to 
the gods, priests were sent to sacri- 
fice, and finally, as the light of the 
sun was falling between the pillars, 
the High Priest of the Maternite 
Machine was heard. 

He rambled through the cus- 
tomary opening remarks and then, 
continually smoothing his white 
beard — of which he is excessively 
proud — approached the crux of the 
matter and the Conclave finally 
heard the facts it had assembled to 
hear. By this time, unfortunately, 
many of the Conclave had departed 
for home and supper. Yet perhaps 
it is for the best, for those left were 
the most earnest and intelligent. 

“I would not bore you,” he said, 
“with details of which only the gods 
are sure. Know, then, that once 
granted a few cells of Prelife, it is 

THE BIRDS AND THE BEES 


an easy matter for the Maternite 
Machine to add more and more; 
thus assuring us, as has always been, 
a continuous source of Prelife to be 
bom by the Generating Machine as 
children. The machines bear the 
exact number of children each year 
to balance the number of us whom 
the gods claim. Such it has always 
been from time immemorial.” 

A murmur of assent and approval 
of these virtuous words whispered 
around the Hall. 

“But now,” he continued, how- 
ever, with less assurance and indeed 
with even a stutter here and there, 
“an unprecedented situation has 
arisen. Indeed, I might call it an 
emergency. For the M-Matemite 
Machine has actually failed.” 

Cries of “Treason” sprang up, 
and I fear it might have gone hard 
for the priest had I not been able 
to insure order. 

“That is not the worst,” he cried, 
as if in defiance. “All the Prelife 
has been dried up. It will not func- 
tion. There is no more. And there 
will be no more children!” 

At this I feared the Conclave was 
about to riot. It is at such times 
that I most revere the wisdom of 
the ancients, who decreed seventy 
years the minimum age for a mem- 
ber of the Conclave. They shouted 
and began to beat their fists, but 
for how long can a man of seventy 
years roar like a youngster? They 
quieted, breathing heavily, and I 
asked, 

“Is there no way, then, to pro- 
duce more Prelife in order that the 
machines may produce more chil- 
dren for us? 

“As I have said,” he replied, 

83 



“give the machines but a bit of Pre- 
life and they will produce more. 
But take away that least bit, and 
they are helpless.” 

Such heresy could have brought 
a sad end to the priest had not the 
Conclave been so exhausted by the 
events of the day. We leaned back 
to think. 

Rocsates leaned forward and 
asked, “Must there not — must there 
not have been a beginning to Pre- 
life? For the Machine, it seems, 
cannot make it; and yet it came 
from somewhere.” 

“Riddles are not called for,” I 
answered severely. 

“Are not riddles often the begin- 
ning of knowledge?” he asked, in 
that irritating dumber-than-thou 
attitude of his. “Must there not, 
long ago, have been a source of 
Prelife: a source now forgotten? 
And may it not even now — should 
we discover it — be available to us? 
I am reminded of the story of the 
animals of old — ” 

“I fear your mind is wandering, 
Rocsates,” I was forced to inter- 
rupt. “I know well the legend of 
the animals, but what does it have 
to do — ” The heads of the Con- 
clave were turning to me, quizzical- 
ly. I hastened to explain the legend 
of the animals. “It is said that many 
thousands of years ago, time with- 
out reckoning, there existed on the 
earth creatures who were alive like 
us, and yet not like us. It is said 
they had four legs or more, and no 
arms, were covered with hair, and 
although not mute, they could not 
speak.” 

Rocsate’s voice made itself heard. 
“It is true. Such creatures did in- 


deed exist. It is recorded most 
scientifically in the films.” 

“If it be so,” I said, quieting the 
hub-bub that followed, “and I 
would not doubt your word, Roc- 
sates, for all know you are the wisest 
of men — if it were so, then, what of 
it?” 

“May it not be,” Rocsates put in, 
“that these animals had no ma- 
chines to reproduce their kind? For 
surely the gods would not grant 
machines to such creatures. And 
indeed, if they had Maternite Ma- 
chines, why then we would yet 
have these animals among us.” 

“And how, then, did these ani- 
mals reproduce?” I asked. 

“How, indeed? And is there not 
a legend — admitted only a legend 
— that says there was a time before 
the machines, and before the Ma- 
ternite Machine, and that at such 
a time both the animals and Men 
reproduced from within their own 
bodies?” 

At this two members of the Con- 
clave fell immediately into a faint, 
and I would gladly have joined 
them. I hoped that the youngsters, 
Xeon and Melia, had not heard, but 
as I turned they were listening most 
attentively to Rocsates, who, amid 
cries of “Heresy” and “Treason”, 
went on: 

“I should like to ask the Con- 
clave for permission to search the 
ancient records, in the hope of find- 
ing some such knowledge that 
would prove or disprove my 
words.” 

“You wish to search the films — •” 
I began. 

“Not the films, Sias, but the 
books.” 


84 


DAVE E. FISHER 



Gods, this Rocsates! The books, 
as well he knows, are so ancient, 
and so delicate, that they are kept 
in an air-tight tomb; lest, being 
handled, they be destroyed and all 
knowledge within them lost. There- 
fore, they have not been read in the 
known history of our race. And 
Rocsates has been anxious for an 
excuse — 

“Sias,” he went on, “if there ex- 
ists such knowledge as I seek, is it 
not indeed lost to the memory of 
Man? And if so, are not the books 
the only place where it may be 
found?” 

Rocsates, it is suspected, will 
never ask a question unless he 
knows the answer beforehand. And 
so I acquiesced, and agreed, and 
granted permission. And with much 
misgiving and foreboding of evil, 
the Conclave adjourned. 

S EVERAL WEEKS elapsed be- 
fore Rocsates requested that the 
Conclave meet. I called the meet- 
ing at dawn and so it was yet early 
in the afternoon when formalities 
were concluded and Rocsates 
granted leave to speak. 

“Some of those among you are 
She’s” he began. “And you know 
you are different from the rest of 
us. To the advantage, your skin is 
fairer and your features more often 
handsomer than ours. To the disad- 
vantage, your excretory system is 
not so mechanically dextrous as 
ours. And, you may say, why should 
this not be so? There is, indeed, no 
reason why we should all be iden- 
tical. Perforce you have the advan- 
tage, perforce we do. Yet there is 

THE BIRDS AND THE BEES 


one other distinction. 

“Some among you She’s have the 
swelling of the breasts. And does 
there exist no reason for this? Was 
there not, perhaps in ancient times, 
a cause for this? Do you not won- 
der, She’s, whence you come and 
for what reason?” 

“Rocsates,” I interrupted. “All 
this is fascinating, of course. But if 
you could be quick — ” 

“Of course,” he replied. “In the 
course of my reading I have read 
many books, and while they are all 
vague on the subject, this I have 
discovered : 

“That there was indeed a time 
before the machines, in fact the 
books were created in that time, for 
not one of them mentions the ma- 
chines. Then reproduction was car- 
ried on by individuals, without help 
of the then nonexistent machines. 
The She’s are not wanderers from 
another land, but they have lived 
with us for all time; they are not 
another race, but we are all types 
of one race. And the fact of repro- 
duction is somehow intimately re- 
lated to the physical distinctions of 
the She’s!” 

These last sentences were shouted 
to be heard above the roar of the 
crowd. Yet when Rocsates stopped, 
so also did the noise, so shocked 
and amazed at his words were they. 
And I confess, myself also. 

“In fact,” Rocsates added, sitting 
down, “this process of reproduction 
seems to have been so simple that 
there was once a problem of over- 
population.” 

Order was lost among the Con- 
clave as each man turned to speak 
to his neighbor, and for some time 


85 



I could not restore order. I realized 
that something had to be done to 
save Rocsates before the outrage of 
the assembled overwhelmed him. 

“It seems,” I shouted, “that there 
is a flaw in your logic.” For if such 
there was, I was hopeful of dismiss- 
ing the entire affair with no harm 
done. “For if people reproduced 
too often, why then this reproduc- 
tion must have been a pleasant 
thing to do; otherwise they would 
not have done so to excess. And if 
it was a pleasant thing to do, where 
is the necessity for the machines, 
and why were they created?” 

Rocsates seemed perplexed by 
this problem, whereupon Xeon, 
who together with Melia were at 
the Conclave without permission, 
shouted, “Perhaps the process of 
reproduction was of such a pleas- 
ure that the Conclave ruled it to 
be a sin? And therefore the ma- 
chines were necessary!” 

At this impudence the Conclave 
dissolved in an uproar, and I was 
beyond power to restrain them 
from placing Xeon under arrest. 
Privately, however, I had to admit 
that his supposition was a possibil- 
ity, and thus I authorized Rocsates 
to continue his search. 

Now indeed I was sorely worried 
concerning Xeon, for he must lan- 
guish in the dungeon until the Con- 
clave is satisfied to release him, and 
this they cannot do until they meet 
again. 

I needed a sufficient excuse to 
call a meeting of the Conclave, 
whereupon I might argue for the 
lad. When I heard that Rocsates 
again desired audience, I immedi- 

86 


ately proclaimed a meeting of the 
Conclave to be held the next day 
at dawn, and so that night slept 
well. 

The Conclave had come to order 
and formalities had been initiated 
when Rocsates entered and took his 
place. He clutched under one 
shoulder a thin, rectangular object, 
but that is not what impressed me. 
His appearance — he looked as if he 
had not slept of late, nor eaten 
either. His eyes were sunken, and 
his features had doubled in age. He 
was bent and tired. But it was his 
eyes. There was a horror in them. 

I was shocked, and could not 
help staring at him. And then the 
formalities were over. I intended to 
speak for Xeon, but Rocsates was 
on his feet and I gave way. 

“I have indeed discovered the 
secret of reproduction,” he began. 
“After many searchings, I came 
upon this — ” and he held forth the 
object he had carried in. “It is a 
book. It is entitled, ‘Living a Nor- 
mal Sex Life.’ It seems to be some 
sort of a do-it-yourself pamphlet.” 
He dropped the book on the table 
and rubbed his hands over his eyes. 

There was something in the 
man’s behavior that commanded 
everyone’s attention. He went on, 
speaking low. “The word ‘Sex’ is 
not defined, but it seems to mean 
...” His words trailed off. He was 
obviously unsure of how to con- 
tinue. “I had better start at the be- 
ginning, I suppose,” he said. “You 
see, once upon a time the$e were 
birds and bees . 

When he finished the Conclave 
sat in horrified silence. His words, 

DAVE E. FISHER 



with all their horror, had the ring 
of truth and there were no cries of 
‘Heresy’. There was only stunned 
disbelief and the beginnings of 
nausea. 

It is the mark of honor that a 
leader shall carry on when others 
fear to move. I cleared my throat. 

“Shall not these organs which 
you mention have atrophied by 
now? With no use throughout all 
these generations, will they not 
have evolved into nothingness?” 

“I do not think so,” Rocsates re- 
plied after a while. “What to us is 
an eon, to evolution is but an in- 
stant. And then the swelling of the 
breasts, I believe, proves that there 
is still reproductive activity in some, 
at least, of the She’s.” 

We sat shaking our heads, bowed 
under terrible reality. 

“Then we must experiment,” I 
said. “But whom could we ask to 
submit to such horror?” 

“I have already taken the liberty 
of asking for volunteers,” Rocsates 
replied. “The She, of course, must 
be one with the swelling of the 
breasts. Melia has volunteered, on 
condition that Xeon be released 
from dungeon. Are there any objec- 
tions?” 

There were none, of course. Who 
would refuse a boon to one who 
would undergo such an ordeal for 
the City? 

“And who will be the partner?” 
I asked. 

“In all honor, could Xeon allow 
Melia to surpass him in courage? 
It shall be he,” Rocsates said. And 
with his word the two entered the 
Hall and stood, noble and naked. 

Rocsates gestured to the table, 

THE BIRDS AND THE BEES 


and Melia started to climb upon it, 
but Xeon stepped forward. 

“My lords,” he said, “would not 
better results be obtained were we 
to conduct the experiment in the 
fields before the Oracle of Delni, 
that the gods may help us?” 

His glance reached into my soul, 
and I was proud of Xeon. A true 
friend, he thought even now of the 
comfort of Melia. The marble table 
was indeed hard, and from Roc- 
sate’s description it seemed that 
Melia’s position would be as un- 
comfortable as it would be undig- 
nified. The soft fields might be 
some slight help. 

I voiced my assent, and the entire 
Conclave adjourned to the fields. 

I T WAS nearly dark when we 
walked home, Rocsates and I, 
arm in arm. It had been a horrible 
day. The inhuman indignity, the 
cries — 

We tarried before my home, 
leaned on the stone, stared at the 
first stars. 

“They seemed finally to accom- 
plish all the book described,” I 
muttered. 

“They may indeed have suc- 
ceeded,” Rocsates replied. “There 
is mentioned a time lapse which is 
necessary. The child does not ap- 
pear immediately.” 

“It doesn’t matter,” I said dis- 
consolately. “Who could ask them 
to go through such an ordeal 
again?” 

And then I looked down to earth 
again, and saw them standing be- 
fore me. Melia cast her eyes down,

BRAMBLE BUSH 


There was a man in our town, and he was 

wondrous wise; 

He jumped into a bramble bush and 
scratched out both his eyes. 

And when he saw what he had done, with 

all his might and main 

He jumped into another bush and scratched 

them in again. 

MOTHER OOOSE 


D R. DAVID LESSING found Jack Dorffman and 
the boy waiting in his office when he arrived at 
the Hoffman Center that morning. Dorffman looked 
as though he’d been running all night. There were 
dark pouches under his eyes; his heavy unshaven face 
seemed to sag at every crease. Lessing glanced sharply 
at his Field Director and sank down behind his desk 
with a sigh. “All right, Jack — what’s wrong?” 

“This kid is driving me nuts,” said Dorffman 
through clenched teeth. “He’s gone completely hay-

wire. Nobody’s been able to get near 
him for three weeks, and now at six 
o’clock this morning he decides he’s 
leaving the Farm. I talk to him, I 
sweat him down, I do everything 
but tie him to the bed, and I waste 
my time. He’s leaving the Farm. 
Period.” 

“So you bring him down here,” 
said Lessing sourly. “The worst 
place he could be, if something’s 
really wrong.” He looked across at 
the boy. “Tommy? Come over and 
sit down.” 

There was nothing singular about 
the boy’s appearance. He was thin, 
with a pale freckled face and the 
guileless expression of any normal 
eight-year-old as he blinked across 
the desk at Lessing. The awkward 
grey monitor-helmet concealed a 
shock of sandy hair. He sat with a 
mute appeal in his large grey eyes 
as Lessing flipped the reader-switch 
and blinked in alarm at the wildly 
thrashing pattern on the tape. 

The boy was terrorized. He was 
literally pulsating with fear. 

Lessing sat back slowly. “Tell me 
about it, Tommy,” he said gently. 

“I don’t want to go back to the 
' Farm,” said the boy. 

“Why?” 

“I just don’t. I hate it there.” 

“Are you frightened?” 

The boy bit his lip and nodded 
slowly. 

“Of me? Of Dr. Dorffman?” 

“No. Oh, no!” 

“Then what?” 

Again the mute appeal in the 
boy’s eyes. He groped for words, 
and none came. Finally he said, “If 
I could only take this off — ” He 
fingered the grey plastic helmet. 

90 


“You think that would make you 
feel better?” 

“It would, I know it would.” 
Lessing shook his head. “I don’t 
think so, Tommy. You know what 
the monitor is for, don’t you?” 

“It stops things from going out.” 
“That’s right. And it stops things 
from going in. It’s an insulator. You 
need it badly. It would hurt you a 
great deal if you took it off, away 
from the Farm.” 

The boy fought back tears. “But 
I don’t want to go back there — ” 
The fear-pattern was alive again on 
the tape. “I don’t feel good there. I 
never want to go back.” 

“Well, we’ll see. You can stay 
here for a while.” Lessing nodded 
at Dorffman and stepped into an 
adjoining room with him. “You say 
this has been going on for three 
weeks ? 33 

“I’m afraid so. We thought it 
was just a temporary pattern — we 
see so much of that up there.” 

“I know, I know.” Lessing 
chewed his lip. “I don’t like it. We’d 
better set up a battery on him and 
try to spot the trouble. And I’m 
afraid you’ll have to set it up. I’ve 
got that young Melrose from Chi- 
cago to deal with this morning — the 
one who’s threatening to upset the 
whole Conference next month with 
some crazy theories he’s been play- 
ing with. I’ll probably have to take 
him out to the Farm to shut him 
up.” Lessing ran a hand through 
sparse grey hair. “See what you can 
do for the boy downstairs.” 

“Full psi precautions?” asked 
Dorffman. 

“Certainly! And Jack — in this 
case, be sure of it. If Tommy’s in 

ALAN E. NOURSE 



the trouble I think he’s in, we don’t 
dare risk a chance of Adult Con- 
tact now. We could end up with a 
dead boy on our hands.” 

Two letters were waiting on Less- 
ing’s desk that morning. The first 
was from Roberts Bros., announc- 
ing another shift of deadline on the 
book, and demanding the galley 
proofs two weeks earlier than sched- 
uled. Lessing groaned. As director 
of psionic research at the Hoffman 
Medical Center, he had long since 
learned how administrative detail 
could suck up daytime hours. He 
knew that his real work was at the 
Farm — yet he hadn’t even been to 
the Farm in over six weeks. And 
pow, as the book approached pub- 
lication date, Lessing wondered if 
he would ever really get back to 
work again. 

The other letter cheered him a 
bit more. It bore the letterhead of 
the International Psionics Confer- 
ence: 

Dear Dr. Lessing: 

In recognition of your position as 
an authority on human Psionic be- 
havior patterns, we would be grati- 
fied to schedule you as principle 
speaker at the Conference in Chi- 
cago on October 12th. A few re- 
marks in discussion of your forth- 
coming book would be entirely in 
order — 

They were waiting for it, then! 
He ran the galley proofs into the 
scanner excitedly. They knew he 
had something up his sleeve. His 
earlier papers had only hinted at 
the direction he was going — but the 

BRAMBLE BUSH 


book would clear away the fog. He 
scanned the title page proudly. “A 
Theory of Psionic Influence on In- 
fant and Child Development.” A 
good title — concise, commanding, 
yet modest. They would read it, all 
right. And they would find it a light 
shining brightly in the darkness, a 
guide to the men who were floun- 
dering in the jungle of a strange 
and baffling new science. 

For they were floundering. When 
they were finally forced to recognize 
that this great and powerful force 
did indeed exist in human minds, 
with unimaginable potential if it 
could only be unlocked, they had 
plunged eagerly into the search, 
and found themselves in a madden- 
ing bramble bush of contradictions 
and chaos. Nothing worked, and 
everything worked too well. They 
were trying to study phenomena 
which made no sense, observing 
things that defied logic. Natural 
laws came crashing down about 
their ears as they stood sadly by and 
watched things happen which nat- 
ural law said could never happen. 
They had never been in this jungle 
before, nor in any jungle remotely 
like it. The old rules didn’t work 
here, the old methods of study 
failed. And the more they struggled, 
the thicker and more impenetrable 
the bramble bush became — 

But now David Lessing had dis- 
covered a pathway through that 
jungle, a theory to work by — 

At his elbow the intercom 
buzzed. “A gentleman to see you,” 
the girl said. “A Dr. Melrose. He’s 
very impatient, sir.” 

He shut off the scanner and 
said, “Send him in, please.” 

91 



R. PETER MELROSE was 
tall and thin, with jet black 
hair and dark mocking eyes. He 
wore a threadbare sport coat and a 
slouch. He offered Lessing a bony 
hand, then flung himself into a 
chair as he stared about the office 
in awe. 

“Pm really overwhelmed,” he 
said after a moment. “Within the 
stronghold of psionic research at 
last. And face to face with the 
Master in the trembling flesh!” 
Lessing frowned. “Dr. Melrose, 
I don’t quite understand — ” 

“Oh, it’s just that I’m im- 
pressed,” the young man said airily. 
“Of course, I’ve seen old dried-up 
Authorities before — but never be- 
fore a brand spanking new one, just 
fresh out of the pupa, so to speak!” 
He touched his forehead in a ges- 
ture of reverence. “I bow before the 
Oracle. Speak, oh Motah, live for- 
ever! Cast a pearl at my feet!” 

“If you’ve come here to be in- 
sulting,” Lessing said coldly, “you’re 
just wasting time.” He reached for 
the intercom switch. 

“I think you’d better wait before 
you do that,” Melrose said sharp- 
ly, “because I’m planning to take 
you apart at the Conference next 
month unless I like everything I see 
and hear down here today. And if 
you don’t think I can do it, you’re 
in for quite a dumping.” 

Lessing sat back slowly. “Tell me 
— just what, exactly, do you want?” 
“I want to hear this fairy tale 
you’re about to publish in the name 
of ‘Theory’,” Melrose said. “I want 
to see this famous Farm of yours up 
in Connecticut and see for myself 
how much pressure these experi- 


mental controls you keep talking 
about will actually bear. But most- 
ly, I want to see just what in psionic 
hell you’re so busy making yourself 
an Authority about.” There was no 
laughter in the man’s sharp brown 
eyes. 

“You couldn’t touch me with a 
ten foot pole at this conference,” 
snapped Lessing. 

The other man grinned. “Try 
me! We shook you up a little bit 
last year, but you didn’t seem to 
get the idea.” 

“Last year was different.” Less- 
ing scowled. “As for our ‘fairy tale’, 
we happen to have a staggering 
body of evidence that says that it’s 
true.” 

“If the papers you’ve already 
published are a preview, we think 
it’s false as Satan.” 

“And our controls are above sus- 
picion.” 

“So far, we haven’t found any 
way to set up logical controls,” said 
Melrose. “We’ve done a lot of work 
on it, too.” 

“Oh, yes — I’ve heard about your 
work. Not bad, really. A little mis- 
directed, is all.” 

“According to your Theory, that 
is.” 

“Wildly unorthodox approach to 
psionics — but at least you’re ener- 
getic enough.” 

“We haven’t been energetic 
enough to find an orthodox ap- 
proach that got us anywhere. We 
doubt if you have, either. But may- 
be we’re all wrong.” Melrose 
grinned unpleasantly. “We’re not 
unreasonable, your Majesty. We 
just ask to be shown. If you dare, 
that is.”

Lessing slammed his fist down on 
the desk angrily. “Have you got the 
day to take a trip?” 

‘Tve got ’til New Year.” 

Lessing shouted for his girl. “Get 
Dorffman up here. We’re going to 
the Farm this afternoon.” 

The girl nodded, then hesitated. 
“But what about your lunch?” 
“Bother lunch.” He gave Melrose 
a sidelong glare. “We’ve got a guest 
here who’s got a lot of words he’s 
going to eat for us . .” 

Ten minutes later they rode the 
elevator down to the transit levels 
and boarded the little shuttle car in 
the terminal below the Hoffman 
Center. They sat in silence as the 
car dipped down into the rapid- 
transit channels beneath the great 
city, swinging northward in the ex- 
press circuit through Philadelphia 
and Camden sectors, surfacing 
briefly in Trenton sector, then 
dropping underground once again 
for the long pull beneath Newark, 
Manhattan and Westchester sec- 
tors. In less than twenty minutes 
the car surfaced on a Parkway 
channel and buzzed north and east 
through the verdant Connecticut 
countryside. 

“What about Tommy?” Lessing 
asked Dorffman as the car sped 
along through the afternoon sun. 

“I just finished the prelims. He’s 
not cooperating.” 

Lessing ground his teeth. “I 
should be running him now instead 
of beating the bushes with this — ” 
He broke off to glare at young Mel- 
rose. 

Melrose grinned. “I’ve heard you 
have quite a place up here.” 

BRAMBLE BUSH 


“It’s — unconventional, at any 
rate,” Lessing snapped. 

“Well, that depends on your 
standards. Sounds like a country 
day school, from what I’ve heard. 
According to your papers, you’ve 
even used conventional statistical 
analysis on your data from up 
here.” 

“Until we had to throw it out. 
We discovered that what we were 
trying to measure didn’t make sense 
in a statistical analysis.” 

“Of course, you’re sure you were 
measuring something .” 

“Oh, yes. We certainly were.” 
“Yet you said that you didn’t 
know what.” 

“That’s right,” said Lessing. “We 
don’t.” 

“And you don’t know why your 
instruments measure whatever 
they’re measuring.” The Chicago 
man’s face was thoughtful. “In 
fact, you can’t really be certain that 
your instruments are measuring the 
children at all. It’s not inconceiv- 
able that the children might be 
measuring the instruments , eh?” 
Lessing blinked. “It’s conceiv- 
able.” 

“Mmmm,” said Melrose. 
“Sounds like a real firm foundation 
to build a theory on.” 

“Why not?” Lessing growled. “It 
wouldn’t be the first time the tail 
wagged the dog. The psychiatrists 
never would have gotten out of 
their rut if somebody hadn’t gotten 
smart and realized that one of their 
new drugs worked better in com- 
batting schizophrenia when the 
doctor took the medicine instead of 
the patient. That was quite a wall 
to climb.” 

93 



“Yes, wasn’t it,” mused Melrose, 
scratching his bony jaw. “Only 
took them seventy years to climb it, 
thanks to a certain man’s theories. 
I wonder how long it’ll take psionics 
to crawl out of the pit you’re dig- 
ging for it?” 

“We’re not digging any pit,” 
Lessing exploded angrily. “We’re 
exploring — nothing more. A phe- 
nomenon exists. We’ve known that, 
one way or another, for centuries. 
The fact that it doesn’t seem to be 
bound by the same sort of natural 
law we’ve observed elsewhere 
doesn’t mean that it isn’t governed 
by natural law. But how can we de- 
fine the law? How can we define 
the limits of the phenomenon, for 
that matter? We can’t work in the 
dark forever — we’ve got to have a 
working hypothesis to guide us.” 

“So you dreamed up this ‘tad- 
pole’ idea,” said Melrose sourly. 

“For a working hypothesis — yes. 
We’ve known for a long time that 
every human being has extra- 
sensory potential to one degree or 
another. Not just a few here and 
there — every single one. It’s a dif- 
ferentiating quality of the human 
mind. Just as the ability to think 
logically in a crisis instead of giv- 
ing way to panic is a differentiating 
quality.” 

“Fine,” said Melrose. “Great. We 
can’t prove that, of course, but I’ll 
play along.” 

Lessing glared at him. “When 
we began studying this psi-poten- 
tial, we found out some curious 
things. For one thing, it seemed to 
be immensely more powerful and 
active in infants and children than 
in adults. Somewhere along the 

94 


line as a child grows up, something 
happens. We don’t know what. We 
do know that the child’s psi-poten- 
tial gradually withdraws deeper 
and deeper into his mind, burying 
itself farther and farther out of 
reach, just the way a tadpole’s tail 
is absorbed deeper and deeper into 
the growing frog until there just 
isn’t any tail any more.” Lessing 
paused, packing tobacco into his 
pipe. “That’s why we have the 
Farm — to try to discover why. 
What forces that potential under- 
ground? What buries it so deeply 
that adult human beings can’t get 
at it any more?” 

“And you think you have an 
answer,” said Melrose. 

“We think we might be near an 
answer. We have a theory that ex- 
plains the available data.” 

The shuttle car bounced sharply 
as it left the highway automatics. 
Dorffman took the controls. In a 
few moments they were skimming 
through the high white gates of the 
Farm, slowing down at the en- 
trance to a long, low building. 

“All right, young man — come 
along,” said Lessing. “I think we 
can show you our answer.” 

r N THE main office building they 
donned the close-fitting psionic 
monitors required of all personnel 
at the Farm. They were of a hard 
grey plastic material, with a net- 
work of wiring buried in the sub- 
stance, connected to a simple 
pocket-sized power source. 

“The major problem,” Lessing 
said, “has been to shield the chil- 
dren from any external psionic 

ALAN E. NOURSE 



stimuli, except those we wished to 
expose them to. Our goal is a per- 
fectly controlled psi environment. 
The monitors are quite effective — 
a simple Renwick scrambler 
screen.” 

“It blocks off all types of psi ac- 
tivity?” asked Melrose. 

“As far as we can measure, yes.” 
“Which may not be very far.” 
Jack Dorffman burst in: “What 
Dr. Lessing is saying is that they 
seem effective for our purposes.” 
“But you don’t know why,” 
added Melrose. 

“All right, we don’t know why. 
Nobody knows why a Renwick 
screen works — why blame us?” 
They were walking down the main 
corridor and out through an open 
areaway. Behind the buildings was 
a broad playground. A baseball 
game was in progress in one corner; 
across the field a group of swings, 
slides, ring bars and other play- 
ground paraphernalia was in heavy 
use. The place was teeming with 
youngsters, all shouting in a fury of 
busy activity. Occasionally a hel- 
meted supervisor hurried by; one 
waved to them as she rescued a 
four-year-old from the parallel bars. 

They crossed into the next build- 
ing, where classes were in progress. 
“Some of our children are here only 
briefly,” Lessing explained as they 
walked along, “and some have been 
here for years. “We maintain a top- 
ranking curriculum — your idea of 
a ‘country day school’ wasn’t so far 
afield at that — with scholarships 
supported by Hoffman Center 
funds. Other children come to us — 
foundlings, desertees, children from 
broken homes, children of all ages 

BRAMBLE BUSH 


from infancy on. Sometimes they 
stay until they have reached college 
age, or go on to jobs. As far as 
psionics research is concerned, we 
are not trying to be teachers. We 
are strictly observers. We try to 
place the youngsters in positions 
where they can develope what po- 
tential they have — without the pres- 
ence of external psionic influences 
they would normally be subject to. 
The results have been remarkable.” 

He led them into a long, narrow 
room with chairs and ash trays, fac- 
ing a wide grey glass wall. The 
room fell into darkness, and 
through the grey glass they could 
see three children, about four years 
old, playing in a large room. 

“They’re perfectly insulated from 
us,” said Lessing. “A variety of re- 
cording instruments are working. 
And before you ask, Dr. Melrose, 
they are all empirical instruments, 
and they would all defy any engi- 
neer’s attempts to determine what 
makes them go. We don’t know 
what makes them go, and we don’t 
care — they go. That’s all we need. 
Like that one, for instance — ” 

In the corner a flat screen was 
flickering, emitting a pale green 
fluorescent light. It hung from the 
wall by two plastic rods which 
penetrated into the children’s room. 
There was no sign of a switch, nor 
a power source. As the children 
moved about, the screen flickered. 
Below it, a recording-tape clicked 
along in little spurts and starts of 
activity. 

“What are they doing?” Melrose 
asked after watching the children 
a few moments. 

“Those three seem to work as a 

95 



team, somehow. Each one, individ- 
ually, had a fairly constant record- 
able psi potential of about seven- 
teen on the arbitrary scale we find 
useful here. Any two of them scale 
in at thirty-four to thirty-six. Put 
the three together and they oper- 
ate somewhere in the neighborhood 
of six hundred on the same scale.” 
Lessing smiled. “This is an isolated 
phenomenon — it doesn’t hold for 
any other three children on the 
Farm. Nor did we make any effort 
to place them together — they drew 
each other like magnets. One of our 
workers spent two weeks trying to 
find out why the instruments 
weren’t right. It wasn’t the instru- 
ments, of course.” 

Lessing nodded to an attendant, 
and peered around at Melrose. 
“Now, I want you to watch this 
very closely.” 

He opened a door and walked 
into the room with the children. 
The fluorescent screen continued to 
flicker as the children ran to Les- 
sing. He inspected the block tower 
they were building, and stooped 
down to talk to them, his lips mov- 
ing soundlessly behind the observa- 
tion wall. The children laughed 
and jabbered, apparently intrigued 
by the game he was proposing. He 
walked to the table and tapped the 
bottom block in the tower with his 
thumb. 

The tower quivered, and the 
screen blazed out with green light, 
but the tower stood. Carefully Les- 
sing jogged all the foundation 
blocks Qut of place until the tower 
hung in midair, clearly unsupport- 
ed. The children watched it closely, 
and the foundation blocks inched 

96 


still further out of place . * . 

Then, quite casually, Lessing 
lifted off his monitor. The children 
continued staring at the tower as 
the screen gave three or four vio- 
lent bursts of green fire and went 
dark. 

The block tower fell with a crash. 

Moments later Lessing was back 
in the observation room, leaving the 
children busily putting the tower 
back together. There was a little 
smile on his lips as he saw Mel- 
rose’s face. “Perhaps you’re begin- 
ning to see what I’m driving at,” he 
said slowly. 

“Yes,” said Melrose. “I think I’m 
beginning to see.” He scratched his 
jaw. “You think that it’s adult psi- 
contact that drives the child’s po- 
tential underground — that some- 
how adult contact acts like a 
damper, a sort of colossal candle- 
snuffer.” 

“That’s what I think,” said Les- 
sing. 

“How do you know those chil- 
dren didn’t make you take off your 
monitor?” 

Lessing blinked. “Why should 
they?” 

“Maybe they enjoy the crash 
when the blocks fall down.” 

“But that wouldn’t make any dif- 
ference, would it? The blocks still 
fall down.” 

Melrose paced down the narrow 
room. “This is very good,” he said 
suddenly, his voice earnest. “You 
have fine facilities here, good work- 
ers. And in spite of my flippancy, 
Dr. Lessing, I have never imagined 
for a moment that you were not an 
acute observer and a careful, highly 
imaginative worker. But suppose 

ALAN E. NOURSE 



I told you, in perfect faith, that 
we have data that flatly contradicts 
everything you’ve told me today. 
Reproducible data, utterly incom- 
patable with yours. What would 
you say to that?” 

“I’d say you were wrong,” said 
Lessing. “You couldn’t have such 
data. According to the things I am 
certain are true, what you’re say- 
ing is sheer nonsense.” 

“And you’d express that opinion 
in a professional meeting?” 

“I would.” 

“And as an Authority on psionic 
behavior patterns,” said Melrose 
slowly, “you would kill us then and 
there. You would strangle us pro- 
fessionally, discredit anything we 
did, cut us off cold.” The tall man 
turned on him fiercely. “Are you 
blind, man? Can’t you see what 
danger you’re in? If you publish 
ydur book now, you will become an 
Authority in a field where the most 
devastating thing that could pos- 
sibly happen would be — the ap- 
pearance of an Authority .” 

Lessing and Dorffman rode back 
to the Hoffman Center in grim 
silence. At first Lessing pretended 
to work; finally he snapped off the 
tape recorder in disgust and stared 
out the shuttle-car window. Mel- 
rose had gone on to Idlewild to 
catch a jet back to Chicago. It was 
a relief to see him go, Lessing 
thought, and tried to force the 
thin, angry man firmly out of his 
mind. But somehow Melrose 
wouldn’t force. 

“Stop worrying about it,” Dorff- 
man urged. “He’s a crackpot. He’s 
crawled way out on a limb, and 

BRAMBLE BUSH 


now he’s afraid your theory is 
going to cut it off under him. Well, 
that’s his worry, not yours.” Dorff- 
man’s face was intense. “Scientific- 
ally, you’re on unshakeable ground. 
Every great researcher has people 
like Melrose sniping at him. You 
just have to throw them off and 
keep going.” 

Lessing shook his head. “Maybe. 
But this field of work is different 
from any other, Jack. It doesn’t 
follow the rules. Maybe scientific 
grounds aren’t right at all, in this 
case.” 

Dorffman snorted. “Surely there’s 
nothing wrong with theorizing — ” 
“He wasn’t objecting to the theo- 
ry. He’s afraid of what happens 
after the theory.” 

“So it seems. But why?” 

“Have you ever considered what 
makes a man an Authority?” 

“He knows more about his field 
than anybody else does.” 

“He seems to, you mean. And 
therefore, anything he says about 
it carries more weight than what 
anybody else says. Other workers 
follow his lead. He developes ideas, 
formulates theories — and then de- 
fends them for all he 3 s worth ” 
“But why shouldn’t he?” 
“Because a man can’t fight for 
his life and reputation and still 
keep his objectivity,” said Lessing. 
“And what if he just happens to 
be wrong? Once he’s an Authority 
the question of what’s right and 
what’s wrong gets lost in the shuf- 
fle. It’s what he says that counts.” 
“But we know you’re right,” 
Dorffman protested. 

“Do we?” 

“Of course we do! Look at our 

97 



work! Look at what we’ve seen 
on the Farm.” 

“Yes, I know.” Lessing’s voice 
was weary. “But first I think we’d 
better look at Tommy Gilman, and 
the quicker we look, the better — ” 
A nurse greeted them as they 
stepped off the elevator. “We called 
you at the Farm, but you’d already 
left. The boy — ” She broke off help- 
lessly. “He’s sick, Doctor. He’s 
sicker than we ever imagined.” 
“What happened?” 

“Nothing exactly — happened. I 
don’t quite know how to describe 
it.” She hurried them down the 
corridor and opened a door into a 
large children’s playroom. “See 
what you think.” 

The boy sat stolidly in the comer 
of the room. He looked up as they 
came in, but there was no flicker 
of recognition or pleasure on his 
pale face. The monitor helmet was 
still on his head. He just sat there, 
gripping a toy fire engine tightly 
in his hands. 

Lessing crossed the room swiftly. 
“Tommy,” he said. 

The boy didn’t even look at him. 
He stared stupidly at the fire 
engine. 

“Tommy!” Lessing reached out 
for the toy. The boy drew back in 
terror, clutching it to his chest. 
“Go away,” he choked. “Go away, 
go away — ” When Lessing persisted 
the boy bent over swiftly and bit 
him hard on the hand. 

Lessing sat down on the table. 
“Tommy, listen to me.” His voice 
was gentle. “I won’t try to take 
it again. I promise.” 

“Go away.” 

“Do you know who I am?” 

98 


Tommy’s eyes shifted haltingly 
to Lessing’s face. He nodded. “Go 
away.” 

“Why are you afraid, Tommy?” 
“I hurt. My head hurts. I hurt 
all over. Go away.” 

“Why do you hurt?” 

“I — can’t get it — off,” the boy 
said. 

The monitor , Lessing thought 
suddenly. Something had suddenly 
gone horribly wrong — could the 
boy really be sensing the source of 
the trouble? Lessing felt a cold 
knot gather in the pit of his stom- 
ach. He knew what happened when 
adult psi-contact struck a psi- 
high youngster’s mind. He had 
seen it a hundred times at the 
Farm. But even more — he had felt 
it in his own mind, bursting from 
the child. Like a violent physical 
blow, the hate and fear and sus- 
picion and cruelty buried and re- 
pressed in the adult mind, crush- 
ing suddenly into the raw receptors 
of the child’s mind like a smother- 
ing fog — it was a fearful thing. A 
healthy youngster could survive it, 
even though the scar remained. 
But this youngster was sick — 

And yet an animal instictively 
seeks its own protection . With trem- 
bling fingers Lessing reached out 
and opened the baffle-snap on the 
monitor. “Take it off, Tommy,” 
he whispered. 

The boy blinked in amazement, 
and pulled the grey helmet from his 
head. Lessing felt the familiar prick- 
ly feeling run down his scalp as the 
boy stared at him. He could feel 
deep in his own mind the cold chill 
of terror radiating from the boy. 
Then, suddenly, it began to fade. 

ALAN E. NOURSE 



A sense of warmth — peace and se- 
curity and comfort — swept in as 
the fear faded from the boy’s face. 

The fire engine clattered to the 
floor. 


T HEY ANALYZED the tapes 
later, punching the data cards 
with greatest care, filing them 
through the machines for the basic 
processing and classification that 
alf their data underwent. It was 
late that night when they had the 
report back in their hands. 

Dorffman stared at it angrily. 
“It’s obviously wrong,” he grated. 
“It doesn’t fit. Dave, it doesn’t 
agree with anything we’ve observed 
before. There must be an error.” 
“Of course,” said Lessing. “Ac- 
cording to the theory. The theory 
says that adult psi-contact is dead- 
ly to the growing child. It smothers 
their potential through repeated 
contact until it dries up completely. 
We’ve proved that, haven’t we? 
Time after time. Everything goes 
according to the theory — except 
Tommy. But Tommy’s psi-potential 
was drying up there on the Farm, 
until the distortion was threatening 
the balance of his mind. Then he 
made an adult contact, and we saw 
how he bloomed.” Lessing sank 
down to his desk wearily. “What 
are we going to do, Jack? Formu- 
late a separate theory for Tommy?” 
“Of course not,” said Dorffman. 
“The instruments were wrong. 
Somehow we misread the data — ” 
“Didn’t you see his face?” Les- 
sing burst out. “Didn’t you see how 
he acted?” What do you want with 
an instrument reading?” He shook 

BRAMBLE BUSH 


his head. “It’s no good, Jack. Some- 
thing different happened here, 
something we’d never counted on. 
It’s something the theory just 
doesn’t allow for.” 

They sat silently for a while. 
Then Dorffman said: “What are 
you going to do?’ 

“I don’t know,” said Lessing. 
“Maybe when we fell into this 
bramble bush we blinded ourselves 
with the urge to classify — to line 
everything up in neat rows like 
pins in a paper. Maybe we were so 
blind we missed the path alto- 
gether.” 

“But the book is due! The Con- 
ference speech — ” 

“I think we’ll make some changes 
in the book,” Lessing said slowly. 
“It’ll be costly — but it might even 
be fun. It’s a pretty dry, logical 
presentation of ideas, as it stands. 
Very austere and authoritarian. 
But a few revisions could change 
all that — ” He rubbed his hands 
together thoughtfully. “How about 
it, Jack? Do we have nerve enough 
to be laughed at? Do you think 
we could stand a little discredit, 
making silly asses of ourselves? Be- 
cause when I finish this book, we’ll 
be laughed out of existence. There 
won’t be any Authority in psionics 
for a while — and maybe that way 
one of the lads who’s really sniff- 
ing out the trail will get somebody 
to listen to him! 

“Get a pad, get a pencil! We’ve 
got work to do. And when we finish, 
I think we’ll send a carbon copy 
out Chicago way. Might even per- 
suade that puppy out there to 
come here and work for me — ”

His orders were final. And 
how could these terrified souls 
know their fate was his own? 

THE 

BRIDGE 

i 

T WO LOW flying interceptor 
jets screamed overhead, climb- 
ing for much needed altitude as 
they headed out to sea. The Cap- 
tain took off his steel helmet and 
looked up at the thunderous roar 
just before he leaped from the still 
movjng jeep. When his feet touched 
the ground he moved quickly, 
shouting orders at the olive-drab 
truck convoy he had been leading. 
He pointed his finger at the side of

the road where he wanted the small 
stuff. The “duce and a half’s” he 
directed to the opposite side of the 
road. Then he put his helmet back 
on. 

He watched as the troops quickly 
dismounted and assembled. He 
lighted a cigarette while he waited 
for his three officers. Only then did 
he look at the Bridge. 

The massive steel structure span- 
ning the river was six lanes wide, 
cantilever style with curved upper 
and lower cords. The Bridge looked 
trim and new. It was the Captain’s 
responsibility to see that it stayed 
way. 

He stuck the cigarette in his 
mouth and reached inside the rear 
of the jeep and checked his radio 
set. It was set on K channel, 29.2. 
He expected no messages, except in 
an emergency. 

While he had the time he took a 
yellow sheet of paper out of his 
pocket and read the words pasted 
on it for the fourth time. Somehow 
they never changed; they always 
read the same. And each time he 
got a sinking sensation in his stom- 
ach when he read them. 

Captain Alfred Lowary put the 
yellow paper away quickly when 
the three junior officers of the Bat- 
tery reported. He returned their 
salutes in a lazy sort of way. He 
took off his helmet again. 

“The orders are the same as 
briefing,” he said. “Lieutenant 
Kastner will take the third platoon 
across the river to the West side. 
The second platoon, Lieutenant 
Tudor, will move North of the en- 
trance on this side and take up posi- 
tion in reserve. Lieutenant Meyers 

101 


will set up defense on this side.” He 
inhaled on the cigarette and looked 
at Tudor. “Place your machine 
guns carefully. I want a cross-fire 
on that slight bend on the road 
down there.” 

Tudor nodded. 

The Captain pinpointed Meyers 
with his eyes. “You’ve got the ‘hot- 
spot’ . Just remember . No 
one gets on the Bridge!” 

“But — ” Meyers began. 

“No buts. I said no one. Under- 
stand?” 

Meyers’ “Yes, sir,” was barely 
audible. 

“Any questions?” the Captain 
asked. 

They shook their heads negative, 
except Meyers. He said, “Just one 
thing, Captain.” 

“What’s that, Lieutenant?” 
Lowary asked. 

“Are we supposed to shoot our 
own people?” 

Lowary’s face grew hard. “If we 
have to, Lieutenant,” he said. “If 
we have to.” The tone of his voice 
told them that he wanted to avoid 
any discussion on the subject. 

There was silence. Finally 
Lowary said, “That’s it, then. Let’s 
move.” 

The Officers saluted and began 
to move off. Tudor took two steps, 
then halted and returned. “How 
much time do you think is left, Cap- 
tain?” he asked. 

Lowary took in the man’s square 
face, the set of his jaw. Tudor was 
ex-combat, infantry during the last 
war. 

“Who knows, Lieutenant! Min- 
utes ... or hours. It all depends on 
how strong the enemy is, how fast 



they’re moving, if they are sending 
a boy to do a man’s job.” 

Tudor looked down the river in 
the direction of the City some thirty 
miles away. He seemed to have dif- 
ficulty finding words. Lowary knew 
what he was thinking and it made 
him feel weak and inadequate. 

Lowary said softly, “We knew it 
would come some day, didn’t we, 
Tudor?” 

Tudor faced him. “I guess we 
did . .” he hesitated. 

“Well?” 

“I just didn’t think I would draw 
this kind of duty. I don’t mind 
fighting, I’ve had my share. But I 
guess I feel as Meyers does. This 
will be something new for me, 
shooting my own people.” 

“Perhaps we won’t have to,” 
Lowary said. 

Tudor stepped back a pace and 
gave him a salute. “You don’t be- 
lieve that any more than I do, 
Captain.” He began to walk away 
swiftly. 

Lowary watched him go and he 
wondered how many men in the 
Battery were thinking the same 
thing? It could create a serious 
psychological block. Damn it. It 
was bothering him too. But he 
could do it if he had to. He knew 
he could. 

He climbed into his jeep and ad- 
justed the radio squelch button, cut- 
ting down on the steady crackling 
noise. He found himself repeating 
under his breath. 1 can do it be - 
cause I know I have to. 1 can do it 
because . He jammed down on 
the starter and shoved the gearshift 
into first. He had to force the 
thoughts from his mind. He had 

102 


orders to follow; orders left no 
room for personal feelings. Yet he 
knew the yellow paper in his pocket 
was mocking him. 

The jeep was opposite the bridge 
entrance when he halted it momen- 
tarily. Lieutenant Meyers was busy 
talking to a machine-gunner named 
Morgan. As Lowary recalled, from 
what little he had seen during the 
three weeks he had been command- 
ing the outfit since his transfer from 
the middle west, Morgan was a 
conscientious type of soldier. Mey- 
ers was making a good choice for 
such a delicate position. He moved 
on. 

The tires made a low singing 
sound when he rolled on the bridge, 
heavy tread pounding on steel grat- 
ing. 

A sign attached to an upright 
girder caught his eye. He smiled 
sardonically and he wondered what 
the author had in mind when he 
phrased it. 

It said: IN EVENT OF AIR 
ATTACK— DRIVE OFF THE 
BRIDGE. 

The Captain shook his head. 

When he got to the center of the 
bridge he halted the jeep. He got 
out and crossed over the lanes to 
the south railing and looked down 
at the gray water. It looks muddy, 
he thought. A wide, muddy snake 
winding its way down to the City. 
He looked at the horizon. He 
couldn’t see the City but he knew it 
was there. He wondered for how 
long! 

It will light up like a torch, he 
thought. One huge sheet of red and 
orange flame a mile high, like the 

G. G. REVELLE 



gates of hell swinging open. Then 
there would be nothing but a tow- 
ering mushroom of black smoke to 
mark the spot of the largest City in 
the world. 

He found his hand clutching 
something in his pocket. He took 
it out and looked at it. Then, bit- 
terly, he put it away. It was the 
yellow sheet of paper again. To 
read it would be torture. 

Lowary ran the zipper up on his 
loose fitting green field jacket as a 
sudden chill took him. He blamed 
it on the nonexistent wind as he 
lighted another cigarette. 

The sound of a motor caused 
him to look up. He narrowed his 
eyes, looking at the far end of the 
bridge. It was Lieutenant Kastner; 
he could tell by the foot resting 
carelessly on the outside fender. 
Kastner drove as though he were 
resting in an easy chair with his 
feet nestled on a hassock. 

Kastner swung out of the jeep 
loosely, with the grace of a well co- 
ordinated athlete. A wide grin split 
his face. 

“Just on my way to report to 
you, Captain. Everything is set up 
on my side.” 

Lowary smiled. He had been on 
his way to check Kastner. Lowary 
took in the blond man’s well pro- 
portioned body. Kastner looked 
like the recruit ad on a “wild-blue- 
yonder” poster. 

Kastner’s eyes left Lowary’s face. 
The Captain followed the other’s 
gaze upward. Two long, white va- 
por trails were cutting across the 
blue sky. 

“They’re ours,” Kastner said. 
“They’re heading North by East, 

THE BRIDGE 


toward the ocean.” He looked at 
Lowary. “Maybe they can stop it 
before it starts!” 

“Maybe,” the Captain said soft- 
ly. In his heart he knew it was only 
a faint hope. The Air Force never 
tried to conceal the fact that some 
of the enemy could be expected to 
sneak through in the event of at- 
tack. 

“I don’t think we’ll have much 
trouble at our end of the bridge, 
Captain. I don’t think anyone will 
be fighting to go in that direction,” 
he nodded down the river, in the 
direction of the City. 

“I guess not,” Lowary said ab- 
sently. 

“This waiting can be murder,” 
Kastner said. “It just doesn’t seem 
right, waiting to be clobbered. Sit- 
ting here until they drop one down 
our throats before we can fight 
back.” 

Lowary smiled bitterly. “It’s al- 
ways been that way, Kastner. I sup- 
pose it always will be.” Lowary 
squashed the cigarette butt with his 
heel. 

“How’s Meyers taking all this?” 
Kastner asked. Lowary raised his 
eyebrows. “His sister works in the 
City,” Kastner went on. “They’re 
pretty close.” 

“I didn’t know,” Lowary replied. 
He thought, perhaps I should 
change assignments. Kastner 
wouldn’t picture every woman who 
might try to break through as his 
sister. It would make it easier on 
Meyers. 

“You’re from Dakota, aren’t you, 
Captain?” 

“I was stationed there for three 
years before this assignment. This 

103 



is my first trip East.” 

“Married?” 

“Wife . son and daughter. The 
girl is eight, the boy twelve.” The 
picture of blond, thin, lovable lit- 
tle Susan came to his mind. And 
Ronnie, with the freshly found 
sense of humor, who wanted to be a 
writer when he grew up ... if he 
grew up. He hadn’t seen them or 
Dot since the transfer came unex- 
pectedly. He missed them, badly. 
He hadn’t realized how much until 
just this minute. 

“Did you bring your family with 
you?” Kastner asked. 

Lowary shook his head. “No. Dot 
stayed behind to sell some of the 
furniture, and to let the children 
finish school. It’s no good changing 
schools in the middle of a semes- 
ter.” 

“I guess it isn’t. I wouldn’t know 
though. I’m single.” 

The sound of rubber pounding 
on the steel grating caused them 
both to turn. The Captain expected 
to see an Army 2^4 ton truck. The 
truck wasn’t olive-drab, it was 
white. BAKERY was stenciled on 
the side of the closed cabin in red 
letters. 

Kastner moved to the opposite 
lane on a fast run. He waved his 
arms. “What are you doing on the 
bridge?” he shouted. “It’s closed to 
civilians.” 

The driver stuck his balding head 
out of the window. His face was 
dirty and tired. “The Lieutenant 
back there said it was O.K.” He 
looked at Lowary. “I’m only going 
to Kingston, Captain.” 

Lowary turned to Kastner. 
“Check this guy. I’ll be back.” He 

104 


jumped into his jeep and wheeled 
it around. This time he kept the ac- 
celerator to the floor. Meyers was a 
fool! 

He found the tall, thin officer 
leaning on the rail, looking down 
the river toward the City. He 
leaped from the jeep, reached Mey- 
ers with two strides. 

“If you have to do that, Lieu- 
tenant, do it where the troops can’t 
see you. It’s bad for morale,” he 
said bitterly. 

Meyers spun around quickly. 

“You had orders to keep this 
bridge closed, Lieutenant. Why 
didn’t you?” 

Meyers opened his mouth, then 
shut it without saying a word. 
“Speak up,” Lowary raised his 
voice. Meyers’ eyes met his. “You 
wouldn’t understand, Captain,” 
Meyers said evenly. 

“Try me,” Lowary fought to keep 
his voice down. 

“You seem to forget that these 
are our people . not the enemy. 
He was just a poor working slob 
who wanted to get home to be with 
his wife and kids. To him it might 
be his last day on earth. Who are 
we to deny that?” 

Lowary said nothing. 

Meyers said, “You’re not worry- 
ing, your family is safe out in the 
Middle West. We know people 
around here. They aren’t just shad- 
ows. We should be helping them.” 

The Captain took off his helmet 
He reached for another cigarette. 
Finally he said, “Do you realize 
how important this bridge is if 
there is an attack? It connects one 
of the routes designated for the re- 
lief of the City if it is hit. You were 

G. G. REVELLE 



too young for the last war so you 
probably don’t realize what hap- 
pens when wanderers, escapees hit 
the road. They can tie it up like a 
knot so that no one moves. They 
have other routes they can use. 
This one is closed. We’ve got to 
keep it for emergency use.” 

“What’s one truck?” Meyers said. 

“One truck, loaded with explo- 
sives could park in the middle of 
this huge erector set and blow it 
sky high. All the Reds aren’t in 
those planes the Coastal Defense 
sighted. We have some right here, 
waiting.” 

“But he wasn’t a Red. He lives in 
Kingston!” Meyers protested. 

“How do you know?” Lowary 
said simply. He didn’t wait for 
Meyers’ answer, he turned and be- 
gan to walk away. 

“Captain!” 

Lowary turned at the sound of 
Tudor’s heavy voice. The stocky 
officer was waving at him from up 
the road, pumping his arm with 
clenched fist up and down, the sig- 
nal for double time. Lowary took 
off on the run. He could hear Mey- 
ers’ feet pounding behind him. 

Tudor was standing beside a 
young corporal looking down the 
steep, rocky embankment at one of 
the concrete piers supporting the 
bridge. A small figure was making 
its way toward it. 

“It looks like one of our boy’s 
decided to go over the hill,” Tudor 
said tersely. 

Lowary faced the young cor- 
poral. “Unsling that rifle, son, and 
see if you can pick him off.” 

Lowary felt Tudor’s hand on his 
arm. “There’s no need for that. 


Captain. I’ll send a squad down to 
pick him up.” 

Lowary glanced down at the 
hand. Tudor removed it. He spoke 
directly to the corporal, “I said see 
if you can pick him off!” The sol- 
dier hesitated. Lowary knew why. 
The figure down there was in uni- 
form, probably a friend. 

The Captain snatched the rifle 
from the corporal’s frozen fingers. 
He slapped the stock against his 
own shoulder. 

“He’s probably just a scared, be- 
wildered kid,” Meyers cut in quick- 

ly- 

“If I’m wrong, I’ll apologize,” 
Lowary said as he sighted down the 
barrel. He planted his feet firmly 
and squeezed. The stock slammed 
him in the shoulder. He cursed, 
then he squeezed again. This time 
he remembered to hold his breath. 
The figure slumped, fell off the 
concrete, into the water. 

Lowary juggled the gun once by 
its balance, then he handed it back 
to the corporal who was staring 
dully at the small figure floating 
and bobbing in the water. “You can 
send that squad down to get him 
now, if you want, Lieutenant 
Tudor,” he said before he turned 
away. 

H E WALKED slowly. He could 
have explained, but there 
wasn’t time. Decisions had to be 
made quickly, right or wrong. Per- 
haps the kid down there was afraid, 
just running away. But he couldn’t 
take that chance. There was no 
reason to believe that the military 
didn’t have some subversive ele-

ments within; the Reds had infil- 
tered everywhere else. And what 
better time for the rats to come out 
of their nests, then now, when the 
country was on their target list! 
One man could be as dangerous as 
a Red Division. 

Lowary climbed into his jeep 
conscious of how tired he felt. I’m 
getting old, he thought. He leaned 
back and took off his helmet and 
looked up at the clear blue sky, let- 
ting the breeze fan his face. A high, 
distant speck caught his eye. It was 
trailed by a four-forked stream of 
white. He felt his stomach grow 
cold, as he stared in fascination at 
the four vapor streams that could 
only be one thing; a multi-engine 
bomber. It was coming in from the 
Northwest, heading for the City. 
The enemy had slipped one 
through the defense. 

He tore his eyes from the sky. 
Perhaps no one else had seen it. It 
would be better if they never did. 

And so it comes, he thought. The 
end of an age . back to the sticks 
and stones for good. He drew in on 
a new cigarette, thinking of Doro- 
thy and Susan and Ronnie. He be- 
came conscious of Meyers standing 
beside him. He wished he would go 
away, there was so little time left 
to daydream. He wanted to be 
alone. 

“The guard down the road says 
there is a pile-up of civilian cars 
that demand to go across.” 

Lowary looked up. “Send some 
of the reserve platoon down and 
forcfc them back. You know the or- 
ders!” 

“Look, Captain. We’ve got may- 
be ten . fifteen minutes left. 

106 


What harm will it do?” 

Lowary felt weary. Meyers hadn’t 
failed to see the bomber, neither 
had the people in the cars. They 
knew it was the beginning of the 
end. Meyers and Tudor, and the 
others were wearing him down. He 
felt like giving them their damn 
bridge. It would be easy, so final. 

He took the yellow paper out of 
his pocket and glanced at the 
pasted letters again. When he was 
finished he knew what he had to 
do. He had no choice. 

Lowary handed the paper to 
Meyers. “I’ll take care of things 
down the road. Perhaps you might 
like to read this while I’m gone,” 
he said. The Lieutenant looked 
puzzled when Lowary drove away. 

The traffic was jammed just as 
Meyers said it was. The Sergeant in 
command of the squad had set up 
a small road block. A machine-gun- 
ner, Morgan, was sitting behind a 
.50 Cal. looking down the barrel. 
Lowary drove past them, up to the 
lead car. 

As he threw his legs out over the 
side of the jeep he looked up quick- 
ly. The single multi-engine bomber 
was overhead, still heading South. 
In the distance he could see new 
vapor streams, much smaller, much 
faster. The Interceptor Command 
was giving chase. Lowary could see 
that they would be too late to save 
the City. 

“Please let us through, Captain!” 
a woman near him asked. She was 
slender, she had been crying. 

Lowary felt so helpless. He said, 
“There is nothing I can do. This 
bridge must be kept open for relief 

G. G. REVELLE 



purposes. It is out of my hands.” 

“You’re a murderer. You’re 
keeping us here to be killed.” 

“There were other routes open. 
You should have taken — ” The 
woman flung herself at him, beat- 
ing at his chest with her thin hands. 
“I want to go home,” she screamed. 

Lowary took her by the wrists 
and held her off gently. God give 
me strength, he prayed. It would be 
so easy to let her through, along 
with the others. They would be 
safe, perhaps. But he would be run- 
ning the risk of losing the bridge. 
Everyone in the City wouldn’t die, 
some would survive the hell blast. 
They would need medical attention, 
supplies, food and water. They de- 
served that chance. 

A man’s heavy voice carried 
above the shouts. “We can get 
through if we all try it at the same 
time. He can’t shoot us . he’s in 
the line of fire.” 

Lowary hadn’t realized it, but it 
was true. The machine-gunners 
were sighting down his back. He 
shouted above the rising din, “It 
makes no difference, they’ll shoot if 
they have to.” 

“It’s a lie,” a woman shouted. 
Lowary heard the whine of a pow- 
erful motor start up. “Well, I’m for 
giving it a try,” he heard someone 
far back say. 

Lowary turned and faced the 
gunners. He could see Morgan’s 
strained face. The kid looked so 
young, yet he was the only one 
Lowary felt he could depend on. 
“If anything moves down here I 
want you to open fire,” he called 
to Morgan. “Understand?” 

Morgan’s helmet nodded slowly. 

THE BRIDGE 


Lowary turned around. The 
woman seemed undecided. Lowary 
spoke softly. “Why don’t you get 
down off the road, into that gully? 
You’ll be safe there.” 

The woman’s mouth worked up 
and down but no words came out. 
Her face was white and haggard. 

The radio in Lowary’s jeep began 
a familiar crackling sound as some- 
one on the same frequency pressed 
a button on a handset. 

Lowary was afraid to move. He 
could easily start a stampede if the 
civilians thought he was making 
the move just to get out of the line 
of sight of the machine gunners. 
Slowly, he raised his hand until it 
was near the .45 resting in the hol- 
ster clipped to his web belt. 

He waited. 

“LARGO ONE— THIS IS 

LARGO NINE— OVER.” 

Lowary edged backwards, still 
facing the crowd. The woman was 
crying now. Down the line of cars 
he could hear the high powered 
motor being gunned as it was being 
maneuvered out of the line. Soon it 
would make the attempt of running 
down Morgan and the others. It 
wouldn’t stand a chance, but the 
others might succeed in the con- 
fusion that would follow. 

He made the decision then. De- 
liberately, he turned his back on 
the crowd and walked to the jeep. 

“Don’t let him turn on that 
radio,” a man’s voice called. “He 
will warn the rest of the troops to 
be waiting for us.” 

Lowary picked up the hand-mike. 
“This is Largo One,” he said. 
“THIS IS LARGO NINE,” the

In youth Lauria was beautiful, 
proud, unattainable. But when 
autumn came, she changed her 
code and lowered her defense. 


L AURIA SWEPT down the spi- 
ral staircase in regal dignity, 
and wished there were someone 
there to witness her entrance. She 
walked across the parlor to the gun- 
rack and strapped a holstered pistol 
to her hip, just above the rustling 
flare of the full skirt of her evening 
dress. 

The green sun’s slanting rays in 
the parlor window told her it was 
late afternoon, nearly time to get 
started. She went to the full-length 
mirror. Beside the mirror hung the 
framed copy of the Constitution 
of Pamplin, hand-lettered on parch- 
ment. In bold red letters it pro- 
claimed : 

We, the people of Pamplin , hold 
that: 

1. No government is the best 
government. 


THE LAST BRAVE INVADER 


BY 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 


2. A man's home is his castle . 

3. A woman's rights are equal 
to a man's rights. 

4. Only the brave deserve the 
fair. 

Lauria looked in the mirror, al- 
most fearfully. 

She saw with approval the 
breadth of her hips, the erectness 
of her shoulders. With more re- 
luctance, her eyes rose to her face. 
There was still beauty there, she 
told herself, to the discerning eye. 
That touch of slackness to the jaw, 
that faint hollowness of cheek: 
those were no doubt exaggerated 


108 



by the dimness of the room. 

In a table drawer, Lauria found 
jars and tubes. From them she 
carefully filled in a fuller form for 
her mouth, dabbed heavily at her 
cheeks, touched up her eyes, 
smeared over her jawline. She 
fluffed out the thinning blond hair 
and donned a light scarf then she 
removed the heavy bars from the 
front door. She went out, and 
locked its triple locks behind her. 
She gazed around cautiously and 
stepped lightly down the gravelled 
path. Around the house, the 
grounds were a solid mass of 
blooming flowers. Lauria had 
plenty of time to spend in the 
garden. The baskets and other 
handicraft articles that were her 
means of income left her a good 
deal of leisure, and cooking and 
household chores were routine and 
brief. 

Farther from the house, the 
grounds looked better kept than 
they were. It was fortunate that 
the blue grass of the planet Pamplin 
grew short and neat, for Lauria 
never would have been able to keep 
the ten acres of her property 
trimmed. But the big trees that 
shaded the grounds had dropped 
twigs and leaves that she wouldn’t 
clear away until the big effort of 
the fall clean-up. 

The path curved down past a 
small cleared area in which a doz- 
en upright wooden markers were 
spaced in rows. This was the cem- 
etery. 

She paused to look out across 
the neat rows of markers. There 
were men buried there. Twelve 
young men. They had died by her 


hand, in accordance with the Con- 
stitution and the law. 

At one end of the cemetery stood 
a large wooden plaque on which 
she had carved the Constitution 
of Pamplin. Many times had her 
mother explained the meaning of 
the Constitution to Lauria, when 
Lauria was a little girl and still 
intruding on her mother’s privacy. 

“The people who colonized Pam- 
plin left Earth many years ago be- 
cause there they always had to sac- 
rifice some of their individual rights 
to some government,” her mother 
had said. “There are many kinds 
of governments, but all of them 
try to regulate people. And to regu- 
late people, they have to invade 
people’s privacy. 

“The people of Pamplin came 
to this world because we don’t 
want any government. We believe 
that every man and woman should 
have his individual right to do as 
he pleases, without other people 
bothering him.” 

“But what does No. 4 mean, 
Mother?” Lauria had asked. 

“ ‘ Only the brave deserve the 
fair?* ” 

“That means,” replied her moth- 
er, for Lauria was fourteen and 
deserved to know these things, 
“that a woman on Pamplin is not 
subservient to the whims of men. 
No man may approach her and 
take her in his arms unless he has 
fought his way through the de- 
fenses of her home. Then they 
may agree to share the home, if 
they wish, but no woman of any 
character will permit a man to do 
this until he has proved his valor 
by fighting his way to her.” 



“Then my father must have been 
a brave man, wasn’t he, Mother?” 

“Yes, he was, my dear,” said her 
mother, smiling tenderly. “He was 
very persuasive, too.” 

Lauria never saw her father, and 
no other man invaded the privacy 
of her mother’s home while she 
lived there. Two men tried, and 
Lauria remembered the tense stir- 
rings about the darkened house in 
the dead of night, the flash and 
roar of the guns, and her frightened 
glimpses of the men her mother 
had shot down as they tried to 
break in. 

Her father must have been very 
courageous, Lauria thought. She 
constructed a handsome picture of 
her father in her mind, and 
dreamed of the day a handsome 
man like he would conquer her, 
when she lived in her own home. 

Lauria’s mother had some prop- 
erty on which she wanted Lauria 
to build a house, but Lauria was 
impatient. Even though her mother 
would hire men from town, Lauria 
would have to do much of the work 
herself and it would take years. So 
at sixteen, Lauria got her a house, 
ready-built. 

She crept past the defenses of 
one of the best homes in the area. 
She broke into the house at night 
and killed the defender, a tired old 
man, in a blazing gun battle. The 
house became her home, and she 
improved its defenses. 

Her ownership of the house, and 
her manner of taking it, gave her 
an immediate social standing far 
above that of her mother. She 
knew that she was envied : the 
bright-haired, beautiful young 

110 


woman who held the ramparts of 
the big house and challenged all 
comers to conquer her. 

There were men who tried, and 
the first nearly succeeded. Even 
now, after many years, she could 
remember Poll’s youthful, arrogant 
face, his lazy smile. They had met 
in the market place. 

“An attractive spitfire, if ever I 
saw one,” he had said to her. 
“Would you surrender to my arms, 
pretty one?” 

“If you’re strong enough to come 
and take me,” she challenged, fire 
singing in her blood. 

And that night he had come. In 
the starlight she fired from her 
windows at the shadowy figure that 
flitted among the bushes and trees, 
and powder smoke hung heavy in 
the air. It was after several hours 
and a long silence, when she 
thought he had given up and gone 
away, that he almost surprised her. 

She was crouching in the par- 
lour, waiting for the dawn, when 
there was a slight noise behind her. 
She whirled, whipping up her gun, 
and he was coming toward her 
swiftly and silently from the hall, 
a smile of triumph on his handsome 
face. 

He was holding out his arms for 
her and there was no weapon in 
his hand when she shot him down. 

She wept for a long time over 
his fair body, and knew to her 
shame that she had wanted him 
to conquer. Then she took him out 
and buried him beneath the grass. 
His grave was the first one, and 
behind it later she erected the 
wooden plaque bearing the words 
of the Constitution of Pamplin.

Others had tried, and their graves 
were here, with Poll’s. And the 
years had passed, and no man had 
overrun the defenses of Lauria’s 
.house. 

The frost of autumn was in her 
veins now as she looked at the 
graves of twelve young men, who 
had been young and eager in the 
years when she had been young. 
Slowly she turned away, went out 
the barred front gate of her prop- 
erty and waited for the crowd of 
merrymakers she would accompany 
to the party in town. 

The music reverberated gaily 
amid the rafters of the huge com- 
munity hall. At one end a fire 
blazed merrily in a big fireplace. 
Young couples, and their elders, 
danced variations of the steps that 
had been brought from Earth gen- 
erations ago. 

No one wore weapons here, al- 
though every person in the hall 
had worn or carried a gun on the 
way here. The guns were checked 
at the entrance, and the doors were 
barred against any lawless raider. 

Here, as in the market daily, 
people congregated. Here they 
were people and not individuals. 

Outside, between here and their 
homes, they were individuals again, 
but still friendly, if wary. They car- 
ried their arms, they were careful 
of their language, they watched 
the people around them for 
signs of aggression. Outside was a 
code of conduct that was different 
from the sociable code inside, a 
code that condoned a duel over 
an insult, that recognized robbery, 
rape and even death if one were 

THE LAST BRAVE INVADER 


caught unarmed and alone. 

And in their homes . well, 
there was Cholli Rikkard. He was 
one-armed because of a wound he 
had suffered conquering Fanni in 
her home. Cholli had been a gay 
fellow who had stormed house after 
house of pretty women before, but 
after that he settled down with 
Fanni and they now had five 
children. They shared their privacy, 
but half a dozen times Cholli had 
stayed up all night fighting off 
those who would invade it. 

The strange thing was that one 
or more of those who had sought 
to invade Cholli’s home and take 
his wife and house from him might 
be dancing here tonight, perhaps 
chatting amiably with Cholli. 
Cholli might even know them for 
the attackers. Here they were all 
friends, suspending their cherished 
privacy for weekly companionship. 

Lauria was one of those who sat 
among the oldest, and talked un- 
happily with those on either side 
of her. It was not that she was 
that old, for she wasn’t. It was that 
Lauria’s home now had the reputa- 
tion of a deadly, unassailable for- 
tress, and few men cared even to 
dance with her. It was that they 
feared her, she told herself as she 
sat there after only two dances. 

“Care to dance this one, Miss 
Lauria?” 

She looked up, startled. It was 
Cholli Rikkard, smiling at her, 
holding out his one arm apologet- 
ically. 

She arose, gratefully, and took his 
hand. She and Cholli were old 
friends. Perhaps it was the sym- 
pathy of the handicapped for the 

111 



handicapped: the man with only 
one arm for the woman with 
(perhaps?) too much stem pride. 

“Tell me something, Cholli,” said 
Lauria as they danced. “Is it true 
that many women deliberately 
allow men to invade their privacy?” 
He looked at her blandly. 

4 ‘That would be a violation of the 
Constitution, Lauria,” he said. 

“I know it would,” she said im- 
patiently. “But do they?” 

“I’ve heard rumours.” 

“I’ve heard rumours, too, but I 
want the truth. You know the truth, 
Cholli. You conquered quite a few 
women before Fanni shot you in 
the arm.” 

He grinned. 

“Fanni always was a poor shot,” 
he said. “Or maybe she’s a better 
shot than I think. Yes, Lauria, it’s 
true. The Constitution is the law, 
and it’s right in principle, but you 
have to face facts. If men and 
women adhered to the letter of the 
law in . well, sex . Pamplin 
would be depopulated by now. I 
thought everybody knew that.” 

“I didn’t,” said Lauria miser- 
ably. “I suspected ... I’d heard a 
lot of talk. But . well, tell me, 
Cholli, how is it done? How do men 
know, I mean, when a woman is 
going to wink at the Constitution 
and let a man enter her home with- 
out fighting his way in?” 

“It depends, Lauria. I suppose 
most often a woman has an under- 
standing with a certain man and he 
gives some sort of signal when he 
comes to her house, so he won’t be 
shot. Some women — quite a few, 
it is — just sort of let it be known 
around that they won’t shoot if a 

112 


man comes around. That’s more 
dangerous, though, and they have 
to be on guard.” ‘ 

“I’d think so,” said Lauria in- 
dignantly. “Another woman could 
take advantage of something like 
that and make a good haul.” 
There was a silence. Then Cholli 
said slily: 

“Did you want to get a message 
to some man — or get the word 
around that . ?” 

“Certainly not!” she retorted 
firmly. “I abide by the Constitution, 
and I value my privacy.” 

“Okay, Lauria. I just thought I 
could get the word passed for you.” 
He grinned. “If it weren’t for this 
bum arm, I might have tried for 
you myself before now.” 

The music stopped and they 
parted. 

“Wait, Cholli!” cried Lauria in 
a low intense voice. He turned and 
came back to her, looking at her 
quizzically. 

“Cholli,” she said, almost in a 
whisper, “pass the word around to- 
night that no young man will find 
my home defended!” 

She turned her back quickly, her 
face flaming, and left the hall, pick- 
ing up her scarf and gun at the 
door. She walked home alone, 
swiftly, holding up the hem of her 
skirt with her left hand and hoping 
savagely that someone would try to 
waylay her. 

I T WAS MIDNIGHT when the 
alarm bell sounded. 

Lauria had been sitting in the 
parlor, with no light but that of 
the fire, a hot drink in her hand, 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



lost in turbulent thoughts. 

Her thoughts twisted slightly. 
Had she made it plain to Cholli 
that only young men would be 
welcome? 

But how could she toss aside 
everything in which she had be- 
lieved for so long, on an impulse? 
Would she not redeem herself by 
shooting down any invader? 

Shame was upon her now, for 
having told Cholli what she did. 
It was not the perverse shame that 
had run hot in her that night when 
she had fought Poll and wanted to 
be defeated, but the shame of hav- 
ing done what she scorned other 
women for doing. 

But Lauria was lonely now, and 
the fire was not as warm as it 
once had been. How many years 
had it been — ten? fifteen? — since 
the last young man had won her 
outer wall, only to fall beneath her 
bullets in the moon-shadows? 

Could she turn now to the ways 
of other women, to dissemble, to 
shoot wide of the mark and put up 
a false defense? Could she now 
betray the weapons that had served 
her so well and true? 

Or would there be a thirteenth 
grave in the little cemetery on the 
morrow? 

The bell chattered nervously. 

She arose and threw ashes on the 
fire. A weariness was in her bones. 
She took a gun from the rack and 
made the rounds of the house, 
checking the locks of doors and 
windows. 

All was secure. More lithely, like 
a pantheress, she went from win- 
dow to window, looking out, her 
gun ready. Some of the old wine of 

THE LAST BRAVE INVADER 


battle quickened in her blood. 

The moon was bright, and the 
trees stood in great pools of shadow 
on the grounds. The bushes stood 
like dark, bulky sentinels. 

At last she saw him, a moving 
shadow against the still shadows, 
creeping closer to the house. Her 
gun came up and she took aim, 
carefully, through the barred win- 
dow. Her hands were as cold as 
ice on the gunstock. 

For a moment he was still, and 
she lost him against the shadows. 
Then he moved again. 

Her gun blossomed roaring flame 
and its stock kicked against her 
shoulder. 

The shadow leaped, became a 
man as it fled across a path of 
moonlight. He was young, and he 
was smiling toward the window. 
Then he was swallowed up in the 
deeper shadows. 

For a moment she was aghast, 
unbelieving. She had missed! Then, 
like a frigid hand clutching her 
heart, came the realization : de- 
liberately, without conscious voli- 
tion, she had pulled the gun muzzle 
aside when she fired. 

She leaned against the wall, weak 
and perspiring. It was true, then. 
She yearned so deeply for a man, 
she so feared the age that crept up 
on her, that the principles of the 
Constitution no longer held real 
meaning for her. 

She did not seek to fire again. 
She knelt on the floor by the win- 
dow and waited, looking listlessly 
into the embers of the fire across 
the room. She felt suspended in a 
nightmare.

That trip abroad may some day be 
made aboard a submarine. Nuclear 
development, gas turbines and hy- 
drogen peroxide used as fuel have 
added up to a possible means of 
shipping that may be speedier than 
surface boats and surer than air 
traffic. What makes submarine 
transportation so alluring is the fact 
that it rarely, if ever, is affected by 
the weather. Unlike other modes of 
travel, a sub could adhere to a very 
tight schedule mindless of typhoons, 
storm warnings, snow, icebergs and 
other hazards. 

A seven-pound rifle that throws out 
lead at the rate of 750 shots per 
minute may become the basic U.S. 
infantry weapon. The new weapon 
is called Armalite by its developer, 
the Fairchild Engine and Airplane 
Corporation, and is the first such 
weapon to be produced by Ameri- 
can industry in more than a decade. 
Currently undergoing exhaustive 
tests, the lightweight, fast-firing rifle 
shows promise of replacing four 
weapons at once: the Browning 
Automatic, carbine, sub-machine 
gun, and .45 caliber pistol. The 
new rifle emphasizes strictly func- 
tional approach, light in weight and 
mechanical and manufacturing sim- 


plicity. It can be fired single-shot 
or full automatic, from shoulder or 
bipod. It is 40 inches long, includ- 
ing recoil compensator, weighs 
seven pounds. It takes rounds from 
an aluminum magazine that holds 
20 short .30 caliber bullets. On full ' 
automatic, the 20-round clip can 
be emptied in 1.65 seconds. Gas 
operated, the Armalite is so de- 
signed that when it is loaded and 
locked the action is entirely closed 
against sand, dust, mud, rain and 
snow. 

A nylon artery, shaped like a “Y”, 
is proving to be a life prolonger for 
the future. The man-made artery 
is designed to replace tired, clogged 
or diseased arteries in the pelvic 
region or as a replacement for the 
human aorta. Called an “aortic 
bifurcation” graft, the nylon re- 
placement opens up new areas of 
surgery; permits “spare” artery 
stocks and can be used by military 
surgeons in field hospitals. 

Latest thing for homes of the future 
is a photo-electronic light switch. 
This is a light-sensitive mechanism 
that turns lights on when it grows 
dark outside, and off when it be- 
comes light again. Unlike clock- 
type switches, this gadget switches 
lights on at a different time each 
night. Simple to use too. Just plug 
the light to be controlled into a 
special plug, face the “eye” of the 
gadget toward the window, connect 
to any 110 volt 60 cycle outlet.

ing an atomic attack. Particularly 
if the glass house is buried in the 
back yard. Researchers think that a 
preformed fiberglass shell, which 
can be buried adjacent to a house, 
would provide people with a cheap, 
comfortable shelter offering pro- 
tection against blast, radioactivity 
and fires. The shelter measures 12 
feet, eight inches high, four and 
one-half feet in diameter, with 
walls one-quarter inch thick. It 
sleeps four, has provisions for food, 
water and blankets. Air condition- 
ing is provided by hand-operated 
bellows. 

Harmful sludging of engines, most 
severe under today’s “stop-and-go” 
driving conditions, may soon be 
eliminated by a new motor oil addi- 
tive being introduced by the Du- 
Pont company. The new detergent 
will prevent sludge deposits at both 
high and low temperature driving. 
It is also unique because it works 
in the presence of water — and 
water is the foremost reason for 
sludge formation. The new product 
surrounds each individual particle 
of sludge in a chemical raincoat of 
its own. The packaged particles 
cannot join forces and settle, but 
remain suspended in oil. So small 
they are invisible, they easily pass 
through the oil screen and filter and 
are drained off when the oil is 
changed. 

Daily predictions of the position of 
the “jet stream”, fast moving cur- 
rent of air in the upper atmosphere, 
may soon become routine weather 
service. The core of this high, fast 
moving wind tunnel has been lo- 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 


cated and plotted on maps for the 
entire United States. Knowledge 
of the jet stream is becoming more 
and more important as more jet 
aircraft are coming into commercial 
and military use. Pilots use it for 
an added “lift” when headed east- 
ward, and try to avoid bucking its 
winds at other times. Exact knowl- 
edge of its height and location for 
a given area and time will be an 
immeasurable aid to tight sched- 
ules. 

An atomic tire, vulcanized by nu- 
clear radiation, has been made by 
scientists of the B. F. Goodrich 
company. This is the first time 
atomic energy has been used to 
treat rubber. The vulcanization was 
accomplished without use of heat, 
sulfur or other chemicals and re- 
sulted in a direct linkage of the car- 
bon atom chains of the rubber 
molecules. The tire, in a steel mold, 
was vulcanized by rotating it slowly 
over radioactive fuel elements taken 
from a nuclear reactor. Scientists 
predict that this “cold” method 
could be a vital element in the 
speeding of production. 

Boron, found in borax and boric 
acid, may soon become the parent 
of a new family of important com- 
pounds. Most provocative is the 
potential use of boron-hydrogen 
compounds as high-energy fuel. 
Pentobrane, for example, releases 
twice the energy of conventional 
hydrocarbon fuels on a pound for 
pound basis. Consequently, it might 
serve excellently in rocket or jet 
motors in missiles and supersonic 
aircraft.

Marcia Burtt’s letter in the latest 
IF evokes much sympathy from me 
— who at 50, am a confirmed 
science fiction and fantasy reader 
in spite of (because of, too) my 
friend’s remarks. I was brought up 
on fairy tales, myths, ghost stories — 
and with every encouragement to 
seek out the imaginative wherever 
it might be — Jules Verne, Poe, 
Edgar Rice Burroughs, Talbot 
Mundy, H. G. Wells and LaFanu. 

When my daughter began her 
career of avid reading, I bought her 
science fiction. It seemed to me that 
even the poorest story had at least 
an idea ; the young mind could 
stretch given an idea. Space opera 
or gadget story, witch’s brew or 
faity drink, here was the field of 
writing most likely to encourage 
her imagination, her curiosity. Her 
brothers followed right along, to the 
profit of each mind. So, in defense 


of science fiction, I say it is one of 
the mind stretching crafts and to be 
valued for that reason if no other. 
All reading is escape. Even the text* 
book allows the student to escape 
from his immediate world into a 
hoped-for world. Science fiction en- 
courages curiosity, a resilience and 
balance of mind so essential in our 
present society. More and more 
science fiction is providing insight 
into human relations. And the 
“trashiest” piece of science fiction 
has more value than the comic 
book, the “true” love story, the 
Hollywood glamour fog that too 
many people mistake for reality. 

* — Grace Warren 
Danville, Cal. 

You printed a letter from Miss 
Burtt who said she had a problem 
concerning the accusation of the 
use of science fiction as an escape 
mechanism. Actually science fiction, 
like any novel, is an escape to a 
certain extent. But as most novels 
don’t do, science fiction broadens 
your mind in that it covers many 
areas. Science fiction has led me 
into many sidelights, among them 
semantics, which is my present in- 
terest. I am but a year older than 
Miss Burtt, in the eleventh grade, 
but I don’t run across the accusa- 
tion. In fact some people who start 
to criticize end up becoming in- 
terested themselves. After all T.V. 
is an escape. So is baseball (and 
look at all the people interested in 
that form of escape). Everyone has 
his own form of escaping and I 
guess it’s pretty hard to see another 
fellow’s point of view when your 
own is completely different from

his* I don’t suppose an ardent wres- 
tling fan can see anything at all in 
a ballet, yet they are both escapisms

Re the readiness of the human 
race for spaceflight, in connection 
with the equalities of said race in a 
peaceful society: Did it ever occur 
to you, Sir, that the cure is some- 
times derived from the very founda- 
f tions of the malady itself? Insulin 
was devised from the pancreas of 
/an unborn calf, and injected into 
the system of a human, it restores 
the blood sugar balance, which is 
in turn maintained by the human 
pancreas. Possibly you will wonder 
what this has to do with the readi- 
ness of Man for space flight. Gould 
it be that the remedy for Man’s 
unrest and distrust of his fellow 
men lies in this venture? Is it pos- 
sible that the energies consumed in 
aggression and protection could be 
channeled into one purpose? Per- 
haps a concentrated effort to ex- 
plore the universe? Possible you 
say, but not probable. Neither, my 
friend, was the airplane; nor the 
horseless carriage; nor the United 
Nations. But, of course, we take all 
these things for granted now. As for 
the baboon (who, by the way, is 
not nearly so intelligent as the 
Chimpanzee) how can you place 
an intelligent, thinking human be- 
ing on the same level with an ape? 
(Even though they are reportedly 
linked genetically) . And what 


makes you think an alien species 
would have “nothing to do with 
us”? If for no other reason, curiosity 
would do the trick. Why else would 
they undertake space travel? 

— Wayne L. Simpson 
Peoria, Illinois 

Jimmy Gunn’s “Green Thumb” 
startled me. Have we here another 
Socrates? All my life (in the sense 
of awareness) I have striven for all 
the knowledge I could get. Yet I 
have always gauged my life by the 
maxim that doing anything without 
knowing why was infinite stupidity 
and danger, and inevitable death 
to the active mind. 

If again we consider knowledge 
a means to an end (i.e. to furnish 
food to perpetuate body, mind and 
soul to a farther goal), why are we 
all now, and why have we since the 
caveman, centered on the means 
and ignored the ends? Will we learn 
love building bombs; spread hu- 
manity forming armies; or find out 
why we’re here looking into micro- 
scopes, spectroscopes, telescopes or 
periscopes? There is the scope of the 
mind, tempered with imagination; 
and the subject of observation — 
ourselves. The answer is within 
ourselves and we ponder our en- 
virons. Why? 

And lastly: Isn’t specialization 
preventing us from finding the 
answer? Aren’t we concentrating 
on a square inch of rock two feet 
from a vein of gold? I say let’s 
learn to use our learning as a guide 
to further learning, not stuff our 
heads with irrelevant facts!

LAST BRAVE INVADER 


( Continued, from page 113) 

She heard the crack as the lock 
was broken on a window in the 
rear of the house, and still she did 
not stir. But her heart began beating 
faster, a cold beating that did not 
warm her body. She began to shiver 
uncontrollably. 

She heard the soft, wary footsteps 
as he came through the house. In 
the dimness, she saw his bulk come 
through the parlor door. A black 
veil passed momentarily before her 
eyes, and her gun slipped from lax 
fingers and fell to the floor with a 
clatter. 


He leaped to one side, and the 
glow of the dying fire glinted from 
his weapon. 

But she stood up against the win- 
dow, in the moonlight, and spread 
her hands so he could see she was 
no longer armed. 

“I am helpless,” she said in a 
voice that nearly choked her. “I 
cannot resist your taking me for 
your love.” 

His laugh boomed out in the rich 
darkness, and she could see that he 
did not lower his weapon. 

“Have no fear of that, old wom- 
an,” he said. ‘Tm only going to 
put you out and take your house.”

Lowary’s hand trembled as he 
laid the 'mike’ on the seat. He 
looked up at the sky. The jet 
bomber had veered left, was head- 
ing out to sea, heavily escorted. 
Lowary took off his helmet and 
signaled Morgan to let the civilians 
through. He knew Meyers and the 
others had heard on their own sets. 

The enemy had been testing the 
defenses, he knew. Another calcu- 
fated move in the cold war. They 
were probing, hitting hard with 
psychology. While everyone was re- 
laxing, enjoying the reprieve, they 


could very well come back. That 
would be their way. 

Lowary was lighting another cig- 
arette when the soldier came up to 
him, saluted. “Lieutenant Meyers 
said to give this to you, sir, and to 
say that he was sorry if he didn’t 
understand before.” He handed 
Lowary the yellow sheet of paper. 

Lowary opened the wrinkled tele- 
gram and read it again for the 
tenth time since that morning.

Lowary put the telegram in his 
pocket carefully. “Hop in, son. I’ll 
give you a lift,” he said to the sol- 
dier. He looked over his shoulder, 
down the river. Then his eyes set- 
tled on the bridge. Finally, he said 
softly, “We’re going home.” His 
heart quickened when he said it.

SCIENCE-FICTION BOOK CLUB 
Dept. IF-8, Garden City, N. Y. 

Enroll me as a member, and rush me my full-length hand- 
somely bound copy of “SATELLITE!” plus the two books indi- 
cated below. Bill me only $1 (plus few cents shipping charges). 
Every month send me the Club’s free bulletin, “Things to 
Come,” so that I may decide whether or not I wish to receive 
the coming monthly selection described therein. For each book 
I accept, I will pay only $1 plus shipping. I do NOT have to 
take a book every month (only four during each year I am a 
member) — and I may resign at any time after accepting four 
selections. 

SPECIAL NO-RISK GUARANTEE: If not delighted. I may 
return all books in 7 days, pay nothing, and this membership 
will be cancelled.
