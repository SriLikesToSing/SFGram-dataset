PREVIEW — This reproduction (black plate on blue tint) is from the 
full-color cover painting by Kelly Freas for the June IF. An interpre- 
tation of THE STRANGERS, by Algis Budrys, it is a dramatic 
presentation of an unusual theme of a story about the "watchers", 
people of another universe — who might be you or any one around 
you! Mr. Freas, whose artwork has appeared in leading national 
publications, considers it one of the best covers he has ever done.

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

THE FACT THAT technocracy is 
leaving the humanities far behind 
becomes more and more obvious 
every day. Science is taking the 
effort of living off our backs, eas- 
ing everything from our minds 
to our aching feet. Electrical de- 
vices to improve our memory units 
are now in the experimental stage. 
Conveyor belts may someday take 
the place of elevators and sidewalks 
and hasten us still more on our al- 
ready hurrying way. Radio clocks 
wake us up to music and start our 
breakfast. We can push a button 
and our automobile starts, we get 
power to run a drill or a still; a 
button cleans our house, furnishes 
conditioned air and warms our 
feet or what-have-you. Technoc- 
racy has taken us into the domain 
of the birds, the fish and the 
gophers; it has devised new drugs 
and techniques for lessening the 
pain of operations and dentist 


drills. We are entertained visually 
and audibly by things that happen 
thousands of miles away and food 
comes prepared any way we want it. 
Everything is geared to a scientific 
formula for easing the burden of 
having to do anything laborious or 
tedious for our mortal selves. But, 
alas, very little is done to improve 
the amenities and brotherhood of 
Mankind. 

Exactly what the formula for 
improving the brotherly relations 
of Man will be is anybody’s guess. 
I don’t think politics will do it; I 
don’t think religion will do it — 
both have had thousands of years 
to work on it and haven’t improved 
it noticeably. Philosophy might 
help, but that is too much of an in- 
dividual science to work for the 
masses. Whether one wants to face 
it or not, it looks as though it will 
take some common catastrophe to 
make Mankind pull together, to 
make two-legged beings appreciate 
and understand each other as re- 
lated souls — “misery loves com- 
pany”; that sort of thing. What- 
ever the mechanics of achieving 
that purpose, good or bad or tragic, 
maybe the end will justify the 
means. And whether it takes one or 
two or a thousand or more years, 
we can sort of anticipate it by de- 
veloping an optimistic outlook on 
life while we’re around. 

MEANWHILE, just to keep busy in 
my idle moments, I have been 
working on a little invention that 
might help out here and there. It’s 
a little gadget that will attack 
many of our more vicious traits by 
remedying the situation before too 


2 



much harm can be done. It is in- 
deed a remarkable machine, even 
to the most science-fiction minded, 
and you will probably recognize 
radar, telepathy, computing devices 
and other scientific items in its 
make-up. It isn’t patented yet, so 
I can’t give you the exact blueprint 
of its manufacture. However, it is 
easier to tell you what it does than 
how it does it. 

Take gossip, for instance. Here 
is a little pastime, innocent enough 
sometimes, but often as malicious 
and murderous as a planned cam- 
paign of propaganda and lethal 
weapons. 

The scene is the regular Wednes- 
day meeting of the Thursday af- 
ternoon bridge club. The girls have 
gotten together to chat, have \tea or 
a light luncheon and, incidentally, 
play a little bridge. The gal who’s 
dummy on the first hand starts the 
ball rolling: 

“You know, I heard from Daisy 
Carter that Gert Smith heard from 
her third cousin Matilda, who lives 
in Old Toadstool, that Josie Brown 
went out with Herman Jukes and 
didn’t get home until four A.M. — 
and just listen to this! — they were 
staggering, practically holding each 
other up. I’ll bet they were up to no 
good. He’s the one that . 

The bridge game has stopped 
cold. The gals are lapping up the 
dirt like four starving cats work- 
ing on a lone saucer of milk. 

Now, this is where my invention 
cuts in and begins to function. 

1. It damps the lady’s speech 
centers and by means of telepathy 
tries to reason with her that, ac- 
tually, she has not seen or heard 


first hand one single thing she is 
repeating and doesn’t know that 
one single thing she’s saying is gos- 
pel truth. It tries to impress on her 
that out of mole hills of unsubstan- 
tiated fact she is making mountains 
to rival the Rockies or the Andes 
with maybe Mount Everest thrown 
in. If this little gambit doesn’t suc- 
ceed in penetrating her thick little 
skull, it . 

2. Interferes with her digestion 
of those creamy confections she 
gobbled at the luncheon, causes 
violent cramps in her tummy and 
forces her to retire to the powder 
room, where she has to stay until 
everyone else is gone. 

3. If measures one and two fail 
and there is a nice handy chan- 
delier or bucket of paint or anvil or 
other heavy object nearby, it simply 
levitates the object to a spot di- 
rectly over her head and . 

Something else my invention will 
be allergic to is the guy who hogs 
the road when he is driving his 
old jallopy or his new dynamic 
hyper-eight; the guy who zooms 
around corners, ignoring stop lights 
or full stop signs or runs you over 
to the side of the road with his 
maniacal maneuvering. Oh boy! 
What my invention will do to that 
monster! 

There are many other delightful 
training-reactions incorporated in 
this little invention for many, many 
other circumstances; but there isn’t 
room to tell you about them in this 
issue. However, you get the general 
idea. 

Let me know if you’re in the 
market for one of the early models.

Discontent was brewing aboard the R. S. S. Indefeasible. And 
Captain Gorbel, a proud “basic” man , could cope with 
it . But Mother Earth turned the tables! 


WATERSHED 


HE MURMURS of discontent 
— Gapt. Gorbel, being a mili- 
tary man, thought of it as “disaf- 
fection” — among the crew of the 
R.S.S. Indefeasible had reached the 
point where they could no longer 
be ignored, well before the ship 
had come within fifty light years of 
its objective. 

Sooner or later, Gorbel thought, 
this idiotic seal-creature is going to 
notice them. 

Capt. Gorbel wasn’t sure wheth- 
er he would be sorry or glad when 
the Adapted Man caught on. In 
a way, it would make things easier. 
But it would be an uncomfortable 
moment; maybe it would be better 
to keep sitting on the safety valve 


until Hoqqueah and the other Al- 
tarians were put off on — what was 
its name again? — Oh yes. Earth. 

But the crew plainly wasn’t go- 
ing to let Gorbel put it off that 
long. 

As for Hoqqueah, he didn’t ap- 
pear to have a noticing center any- 
where in his brain. He was as little 
discommoded by the emotional un- 
dertow as he was by the thin and 
frigid air the Rigellian crew main- 
tained inside the battlecraft. Secure 
in his coat of warm blubber, his 
eyes brown, liquid and merry, he 
sat in the forward greenhouse for 
most of each ship’s day, watching 
the growth of the star Sol in the 
black skies ahead. 



BY JAMES BUSH

And he talked. Gods of all stars, 
how he talked! Capt. Gorbel al- 
ready knew more about the ancient 
— the very ancient — history of the 
seeding program than he had had 
any desire to know. Nor was the 
seeding program Hoqqueah’s sole 
subject. The Colonization Council 
delegate had had a vertical educa- 
tion, one which cut in a narrow 
shaft through many different fields 
of specialization — in contrast to 
GorbePs own training, which had 
been spread horizontally over the 
whole subject of spaceflight without 
more than touching anything else. 

Hoqqueah seemed to be making 
a project of enlarging the Cap- 
tain’s horizons, whether he wanted 
them enlarged or not. 

“Take agriculture,” he was say- 
ing at the mbment. “This planet 
we’re to seed provides an excellent 
argument for taking the long view 
of farm policy. There used to be 
fertile jungles there; but the peo- 
ple began their lives as farmers 
with the use of fire, and they killed 
themselves off in the same way.” 

“How?” Gorbel said automati- 
cally. Had he remained silent, Hoq- 
queah would have gone on any- 
how; and it didn’t pay to be im- 
polite to the Colonization Council, 
even by proxy. 

“In their own prehistory, fifteen 
thousand years before their official 
zero date, they cleared farmland 
by burning it off. Then they would 
plant a crop, harvest it, and let 
the jungle return. Then they 
burned the jungle off and went 
through the cycle again. At the 
beginning, they wiped out the 
greatest abundance of game ani- 

38 


mals Earth was ever to see, just by 
farming that way. Furthermore, 
the method was totally destructive 
to the topsoil. 

“Even after they achieved space- 
flight, that method of farming was 
standard in most of the remaining 
jungle areas — even though the bare 
rock was showing through every- 
where by that time.” 

Hoqqueah sighed. “Now of 
course, there’s nothing but desert, 
naked rock, bitter cold, and thin, 
oxygen-poor air — or so the peo- 
ple wduld view it, if there were any 
of them left.” 

Gorbel shot a glance at the 
hunched back of Lt. Averdor, his 
adjutant and navigator. Averdor 
had managed to avoid saying so 
much as one word to Hoqqueah 
or any of the other panatropists 
from the beginning of the trip. Of 
course he wasn’t required to as- 
sume the diplomatic burdens in- 
volved — those were GorbePs crosses 
— but the strain of dodging even 
normal intercourse with the seal- 
men was beginning to tell on him. 

Yet it was certainly beyond Gor- 
bePs authority to order Averdor to 
speak to an Adapted Man. He had 
suggested that Averdor run 
through a few mechanical courte- 
sies, for the good of the ship. The 
only response had been one of the 
stoniest stares Gorbel had ever seen. 

And the worst of it was that 
Gorbel was, as a human being, 
wholly on Averdor’s side. 

“After a certain number of years, 
conditions change on any planet,” 
Hoqqueah babbled solemnly, wav- 
ing a flipper-like arm. He was 
working back to his primary ob- 

JAMES BUSH 



session: the seeding program. “It’s 
only logical to insist that man be 
able to change with them — or, if 
he can’t do that, he must establish 
himself somewhere else. Suppose he 
had colonized only the Earthlike 
planets? Not even those planets 
remain Earthlike forever, not in 
the biological sense.” 

“Why would we have limited 
ourselves to Earthlike planets in 
the first place?” Gorbel said. “Not 
that I know much about the place, 
but the specs don’t make it sound 
like an optimum world.” 

“To be sure,” Hoqqueah said, 
though as usual Gorbel didn’t 
know which part of his own com- 
ment Hoqqueah was agreeing to. 
“There’s no survival value in pin- 
ning one’s race forever to one set 
of specs. It’s only sensible to go on 
evolving with the universe, to stay 
independent of such things as the 
aging of worlds, or the explosions 
of their stars. Man exists now in 
so many forms that there’s always 
a refuge somewhere for any threat- 
ened people. That’s a great 
achievement — compared to it, what 
price the old arguments about 
sovereignity of form?” 

“What, indeed?” Gorbel said, 
but inside his skull his other self 
was saying: Ah-ha, he smells the 
hostility after all. Once an Adapted 
Man, always an Adapted Man — 
and always fighting for equality 
with the basic human form. But 
it’s no good, you seal-snouted 
bureaucrat. You can argue for the 
rest of your life, but your whiskers 
will always wiggle when you talk. 

And obviously you’ll never stop 
talking. 

WATERSHED 


“And as a military man your- 
self, you’d be the first to appreciate 
the advantages, Captain,” Hoq- 
queah added earnestly. “Using 
panatropy, man has seized thou- 
sands of worlds that would have 
been inaccessible to him otherwise. 
He can take most of the galaxy 
under occupation without stealing 
anyone else’s planet in the process. 
An occupation without disposses- 
sion — without bloodshed. Yet if 
some race other than man should 
develop imperial ambitions, and 
try to annex our planets, it will 
find itself enormously outnum- 
bered.” 

“That’s true,” Capt. Gorbel said, 
interested in spite of himself. “It’s 
probably just as well that we 
worked it out before somebody else 
thought up the method. But, how 
come it was us? Seems to me that 
the first race to invent it should’ve 
been a race that already had it — 
if you follow me.” 

“Not quite, Captain. If you will 
give me an example — ?” 

“Well, we scouted a system once 
where there was a race that occu- 
pied two different planets, not both 
at the same time, but back and 
forth,” Gorbel said. “They had a 
life-cycle that had three different 
forms. In the first form they’d 
winter over on the outermost of 
the two worlds. Then they’d 
change to another form that could 
cross space, mother-naked, without 
ships, and spend the rest of the 
year on the inner planet in the 
third form. Then they’d change 
back into the second form and 
cross back to the colder planet. 

“It’s a hard thing to describe. 

39 



But the point is, this wasn’t any- 
thing they’d worked out; it was 
natural to them. They’d evolved 
that way.” He looked at Averdor 
again. “The navigation was tricky 
around there during the swarming 
season.” 

Averdor failed to rise to the bait. 

“I see; the point is well taken,” 
Hoqqueah said, nodding with gro- 
tesque thoughtfulness. “But let me 
point out to you, Captain, that 
being already able to do a thing 
doesn’t aid you in thinking of it as 
something that needs to be per- 
fected. Oh, I’ve seen races like the 
one you describe, too — races with 
polymorphism, sexual alteration of 
generation, metamorphosis of the 
insect life-history type, and so on. 
But why should any of them think 
of form-changing as something ex- 
traordinary, and to be striven for? 
It’s one of the commonplaces of 
their lives, after all.” 

A small bell chimed in the green- 
house. Hoqqueah got up at once, 
his movements precise and almost 
graceful despite his tubbiness. 
“Thus endeth the day,” he said 
cheerfully. “Thank you for your 
courtesy, Captain.” 

He waddled out. He would, of 
course, be back tomorrow. 

And the day after that. 

And the next day — unless the 
crewmen had tarred and feathered 
the whole bunch by then. 

If only, Gorbel thought distract- 
edly, the damned Adapts weren’t 
so quick to abuse their privileges! 
As a delegate of the Colonization 
Council, Hoqqueah was a person 
of importance, and could not be 
barred from entering the green- 


house except in an emergency. But 
didn’t the man know he shouldn’t 
abuse the privilege on a ship 
manned by basic-form human be- 
ings, most of whom could not en- 
ter the greenhouse at all without 
a direct order? 

And the rest of the panatropists 
were just as bad. As passengers, 
they could go almost anywhere in 
the ship that the crew could go — 
and they did, persistently and un- 
apologetically, as though moving 
among equals. Legally, that was 
what they were — but didn’t they 
know that there was such a thing 
as prejudice? And that among com- 
mon spacemen the prejudice — 
against any Adapted Man — always 
hovered near the borderline of 
bigotry? 

There was a slight hum as Aver- 
dor’ s power chair swung around to 
face the Captain. Like most Rigel- 
lian men, the Lieutenant’s face was 
lean and harsh, and the starlight 
in the greenhouse did nothing to 
soften it; but to Capt. Gorbel, to 
whom it was familiar down to its 
last line, it looked especially for- 
bidding now. 

“Well?” he said. 

“I’d think you’d be fed to the 
teeth with that freak by this time,” 
Averdor said without preamble. 
“Something’s got to be done, Cap- 
tain, before the crew gets so surly 
that we have to start handing out 
brig sentences.” 

“I don’t like know-it-alls any 
better than you do,” Gorbel said 
grimly. But the man’s a delegate 
of the Council. He’s got a right 
to be up here if he wants to.” 

“You can bar him from the 


40 


JAMES BUSH 



greenhouse in an emergency — ” 

“I fail to see any emergency,” 
Gorbel said stiffly. 

“This is a hazardous part of the 
galaxy — potentially, anyhow. That 
star up ahead has nine planets be- 
sides the one we’re supposed to 
land on, and I don’t know how 
many satellites of planetary size. 
Suppose somebody on one of them 
lost his head and took a crack at 
us as we went by?” 

Gorbel frowned. “That’s reach- 
ing for trouble. Besides, the area’s 
been surveyed recently — at least 
once — otherwise we wouldn’t be 
here.” 

“A sketch job. It’s still sensible 
to take precautions. If there should 
be any trouble, there’s many a 
Board of Review that would call 
it risky to have unreliable second- 
class human types in the green- 
house when it breaks out.” 
“You’re talking nonsense.” 
“Dammit, Captain, read between 
the lines a minute,” Averdor said 
harshly. “I know as well as you 
do that there’s going to be no 
trouble that we can’t handle. And 
that no reviewing board would 
pull a complaint like that on you 
if there were. I’m just trying to 
give you an excuse to use on the 
seals.” 

“I’m listening.” 

“Good. The Indefeasible is the 
tightest ship in the Rigellian navy, 
her record’s clean, and the crew’s 
morale is almost a legend. We 
can’t afford to start gigging the 
men for their personal prejudices 
— which is what it will amount to, 
if those seals drive them to break- 
ing discipline.” 

WATERSHED 


“I can hear myself explaining 
that to Hoqqueah.” 

“You don’t need to,” Averdor 
said doggedly. “You can tell him, 
instead, that you’re going to have 
to declare the ship on emergency 
status until we land. That means 
that the panatrope* team, as pas- 
sengers, will have to stick to their 
quarters. It’s simple enough.” 

It was simple enough, all right. 
And decidedly tempting. 

“I don’t like it,” Gorbel said. 
“Hoqqueah may be a know-it-all, 
but he’s not entirely a fool. He’ll 
see through it easily enough.” 
Averdor shrugged. “It’s your 
command,” he said. “I don’t see 
what he could do about it. All he 
could report to the Council would 
be a suspicion — and they’d prob- 
ably discount it. Everybody knows 
that these second-class types are 
quick to think they’re being per- 
secuted.” 

“I see what you mean,” Gorbel 
said. “Well, I’ll think about it.” 

B UT THE next ship’s day, 
when Hoqqueah returned to 
the greenhouse, Gorbel still had not 
made up his mind. The very fact 
that his own feelings were on the 
side of Averdor and the crew made 
him suspicious of Averdor’s “easy” 
solution. The plan was tempting 
enough to blind a man to flaws 
that might otherwise be obvious. 

The Adapted Man settled him- 
self comfortably and looked out 
through the transparent metal. 
“Ah,” he said. “Our target is big- 
ger now, eh, Captain? Think of it: 
in just a few days now, we will be 

41 



— in the historical sense — home 
again.” 

Now it was riddles! “What do 
you mean?” Gorbel said. 

“I’m sorry; I thought you knew. 
Earth is the home planet of the 
human race, Captain. There is 
where the basic form evolved.” 

Gorbel considered this unex- 
pected bit of information cautious- 
ly. Even assuming that it was true 
— and it probably was, that would 
be the kind of thing Hoqqueah 
would know about a planet to 
which he was assigned — it didn’t 
seem to make any special difference 
in the situation. But Hoqqueah 
had obviously brought it out for a 
reason. Well, he’d be trotting out 
the reason, too, soon enough; no- 
body would ever accuse the Al- 
tarian of being taciturn. 

“Yes, there’s where it all began,” 
Hoqqueah said. “Of course, at first 
it never occurred to those people 
that they might produce pre- 
adapted children. They went to all 
kinds of extremes to adapt their en- 
vironment instead, or to carry it 
along with them. But they finally 
realized that with the planets, such 
a system won’t work. You can’t 
spend your life in a spacesuit, or 
under a dome, either. 

“Besides, they had form trouble 
in their society from their earliest 
days. For centuries they were ab- 
surdly touchy over minute differ- 
ences in coloring and shape, and 
even in thinking. They had regime 
after regime that tried to impose 
its own concept of the standard 
citizen on everybody, and enslaved 
those who didn’t fit the specs.” 

Abruptly, Hoqqueah’s chatter 

42 


began to make Gorbel uncomfort- 
able. It was becoming easier and 
easier to sympathize with Averdor’s 
determination to ignore the 
Adapted Man’s existence entirely. 

“It was only after they’d pain- 
fully taught themselves that such 
differences really don’t matter, that 
they could go on to panatropy,” 
Hoqqueah said. “It was the logical 
conclusion. Of course, a certain 
continuity of form had to be main- 
tained, and has been maintained 
to this day. You cannot totally 
change the form without totally 
changing the thought processes. If 
you give a man the form of a 
cockroach, as one ancient writer 
foresaw, he will wind up thinking 
like a cockroach, not like a human 
being. We recognized that. On 
worlds where only extreme modifi- 
cations of the human form would 
make it suitable — for instance, a 
planet of the gas giant type — no 
seeding is attempted. The Council 
maintains that such worlds are the 
potential property of races other 
than the human, races whose psy- 
chotypes would not have to under- 
go radical change in order to sur- 
vive there.” 

Dimly, Capt. Gorbel saw where 
Hoqqueah was leading him. The 
seal-man, in his own maddeningly 
indirect way, was arguing his right 
to be considered an equal in fact, 
as well as in law. He was arguing 
it, however, with facts whose va- 
lidity he alone knew and whose 
relevance he alone could judge. He 
was, in short, loading the dice, 
and the last residues of Gorbel’s 
tolerance were evaporating rapidly. 

“Of course there was resistance 

JAMES BUSH 



back there at the beginning,’’ Hoq- 
queah said. “The kind of mind, 
that had only recently been per- 
suaded that men with melanin in 
their skins are human beings, was 
quick to take the attitude that an 
Adapted Man — any Adapted Man 
— was the social inferior of the 
‘primary* or basic human type, the 
type that lived on Earth. 

“You see, Captain, all this might 
still have been prevented, had it 
been possible to maintain that at- 
titude that belief that changing the 
form, even in part, makes a man 
less of a man than he was in the 
‘primary’ state. But the day has 
come when that attitude is no 
longer tenable — a day that is the 
greatest of all moral watersheds for 
our race, the day that is to unite 
all our divergent currents of at- 
titudes toward each other into one 
common reservoir of brotherhood 
and purpose. You and I are very 
fortunate to be on the scene to see 
it.” 

“Very interesting,” Gorbel said 
coldly. “But those things happened 
a long time ago, and we know very 
little about this part of the galaxy 
these days. Under the circum- 
stances — which you’ll find clearly 
written out in the log, together 
with the appropriate regulations — 
I’m forced to place the ship on 
emergency alert beginning tomor- 
row, and continuing until your 
team disembarks. I’m afraid that 
means that henceforth all passen- 
gers will be required to stay in 
quarters.” 

Hoqqueah turned and arose. His 
eyes were still warm and liquid, 
but there was no longer any trace 

WATERSHED 


of merriment in them. 

“I know very well what it 
means,” he said. “And to some ex- 
tent I understand the need — 
though I had been hoping to first 
see the planet of our birth from 
space. But I don’t think you quite 
understood me. Captain. The 
moral watershed of which I spoke 
is not in the past. It is now. It 
began the day that the Earth it- 
self became no longer habitable 
for the so-called basic human type. 
The flowing of the streams toward 
the common reservoir will become 
bigger and bigger, as word spreads 
through the galaxy that Earth it- 
self has been seeded with Adapted 
Men. With that news will go a 
shock of recognition — the shock of 
realizing that the ‘basic’ types are 
now, and have been for a long 
time, a very small minority, despite 
their pretensions.” 

Was Hoqqueah being absurd 
enough to threaten — an unarmed, 
comical seal-man shaking a fist at 
the captain of the Indefeasible? 
Or — 

“Before I go, let me ask you 
this one question, Captain. Down 
there is your home planet, and my 
team and I will be going out on its 
surface before long. Do you dare to 
follow us out of the ship?” 

“Why should I?” Gorbel said. 
“Why, to show the superiority 
of the bask type, Captain,” Hoq- 
queah said softly. “Surely you can- 
not admit that a pack of seal-men 
are your betters, on your own an- 
cestral ground!” 

He bowed and went to the door. 
Just before he reached it, he turned

EASY DOES IT 


Hal was stranded in the wilderness with a 


beautiful girl, and it was surprisingly en- 
joyable — while his conditioning was off. 
But, after all, how uncivilized can one get? 


BY E. G. VON WALD 


H AL WEBBER leaned back in the soft Formair 
Executive’s seat. Although he twisted and 
shifted his position restlessly, he received the same 
sensation of perfect, comfortable support no mat- 
ter which way he sat in it. Which was only natural, 
of course. Formair was the best suspend-field furni- 
ture manufactured. 

As he squirmed about, he had a faint, puzzled 
frown on his face, and in his stomach he felt a 
lurking sensation of unaccustomed tension. Hal 
simply could not understand it. 

There was a faint humming sound, as the door 
panel slid back. His father entered the office. 
“Well Hal,” the old man murmured softly with 

44 




a placid smile of satisfaction, a year. We may be the richest 

“We’ve done it.” people in the world then.” 

“Done what? Oh, you mean the “That’s nice,” Hal said mildly, 

new coloration process?” His father flicked a finger across 

“Yes. It will quintuple the net a sensitive spot on the front of the 

value of the family fortune within desk and relaxed as a perfect 

45 



Formair attendant’s chair sprang 
into existence to fit his gross, soft 
body. 

“Yes indeed/’ he said with a 
mild sigh. “It’s been a long, long 
time that we’ve been working for 
that. Worked mighty hard, too.” 

“That’s right,” murmured Hal, 
a little more forcefully than neces- 
sary. “Splendid.” 

His father’s eyebrows rose at the 
unusual emphasis, but he was much 
too cultured to question the point. 
He continued along the lines of the 
conversation already started. “We’ll 
have to do something for Bruchner. 
He has been of tremendous as- 
sistance on that project. Did it 
practically all by himself. He is a 
very intelligent man, even if he is 
an Outlander.” 

“Bruchner,” said Hal with mild 
irritation. “All I hear around here 
lately is Bruchner. What is he, any- 
way? Nothing but a savage.” 

“Eh?” said his father softly, rais- 
ing his eyebrows again in polite in- 
quiry. 

“If Bruchner is such a brilliant 
fellow, why doesn’t he take the 
Treatment and become civilized? I 
sometimes get a little tired of an 
employee who tells me I’m wrong 
all the time.” 

“But he is almost always right 
when he makes such statements, 
Hal,” Webber pointed out mildly. 
“For instance, just the other day I 
asked him about the color range to 
be used with the new process on 
the Formair Skydome. He stated 
flatly that blue was a normal color 
for sky. Just like that. I was a little 
startled, of course, at his lack of 
courtesy. But after I thought it over 


a while, blue did seem to be a nice 
color for sky.” 

“Aaa, blue,” Hal muttered. 
“What’s wrong with the green 
we’ve always used in the past?” 

Mr. Webber sighed and 
squirmed a little to get the chair 
into a more comfortable fit. At- 
tendant’s chairs were not quite as 
comfortable as the Executive type, 
even if they were Formair. Then 
he cocked an eyebrow and looked 
at his son with mild concern. “Hal, 
my boy, what’s the trouble? I’ve 
never seen you so completely upset 
in all my life.” 

“I feel funny,” murmured Hal. 
“As a matter of fact, I feel awful. 
Maybe there’s some connection.” 

“Ill,” the old man nodded agree- 
ably. “Yes, I thought you looked it 
when I came in here. Something in 
the set of your mouth. Tight, sort 
of.” . 

With an expression of mild sur- 
prise, Hal reached up and tenta- 
tively felt around his mouth with a 
cleanly manicured forefinger. 

“Son,” Webber murmured, “how 
long has it been since you had your 
last CG Treatment?” 

“Eight years,” Hal admitted. 
“It’s a little overdue, I suppose, but 
surely — ” His voice trailed off soft- 
ly, as his mind seized upon the 
possibility. 

“That’s probably what it is,” 
Webber replied. That was a pretty 
definite statement for someone to 
make about another’s sensations, 
but anyone could see that the old 
man was concerned over his son. 
“Five years is the standard period 
at your age. Why haven’t you taken 
it?”

“Well, you know,” Hal whis- 
pered. “It’s that new thing they 
have in it now.” 

“Ah,” said his father with com- 
prehension. “That’s right, I forgot 
all about that. A change. But you 
won’t mind, really you won’t. You 
just think you will.” 

“Perhaps so,” Hal said, and hast- 
ily changed the subject of conver- 
sation to a less depressing topic. 
“The new coloration process is a 
real success, you say?” 

“Absolutely. We can now provide 
flexible hue and chroma for the 
complete Formair line — Airchair, 
Aircab and Airdome. We’ll be the 
only one who has it, and since every 
Proprietor on the planet will want 
our new equipment as fast as we 
turn it out, we’ll put every other 
firm completely out of the business. 
I’ve already worked out a method 
so that we can convert to export 
goods, too, without waiting for the 
economic balance to be readjusted. 
Of course, the colonies will have 
to curtail a little, but we don’t have 
to concern ourselves with them.” 
“Yes,” agreed Hal. 

“Bruchner has been very useful 
to us on it,” the old man repeated 
again. “We’ll have to show him we 
appreciate it.” 

Hal’s mouth tightened just per- 
ceptibly at the mention of the re- 
doubtable engineer, but he said 
nothing. His father continued in 
his soft, mild voice. “We must make 
him a present of something. Should 
it be money? Can’t give him prop- 
erty, of course, because he isn’t a 
citizen.” 

“I don’t like the idea of giving 
an Outlander money. They get their 

EASY DOES IT 


allotments and that’s enough 
wealth. If you give them money, 
they will be able to buy more than 
their allotment, and that could very 
easily upset our own economic 
balance, you know.” 

“Quite true,” Webber agreed. 
Then he smiled with placid inspira- 
tion. “I know. We’ll give him fame. 
We’ll name the process after him.” 
“Well,” Hal said doubtfully, “I 
guess that would do it.” 

“I think so. He’s been a great 
help. As a matter of fact, though, 
most of the Outlanders are helpful. 
A pity they won’t take the Treat- 
ments and become citizens. It seems 
sort of sad the way their emotions 
cut them up at times. Like old 
Tanan last month. Why, up to then 
he was almost like a civilized man 
— even without the treatments.” 

“I know,” Hal said tonelessly. 
“It was his son, wasn’t it?” 

“Yes. Curious that the old man 
should be so concerned over that 
little unpleasantness. So his son did 
get a little excited and kill a Pro- 
prietor and was executed himself. 
No reason for his father to carry on 
so about it, is there? I tried to get 
him to take the Treatment then, 
but — well, after all, you can hardly 
expect an uncivilized Outlander to 
appreciate the advantages, can 
you?” 

“No.” Hal did not refer to the 
fact that the new element recently 
put into the standard CC Treat- 
ment was causing him to postpone 
taking it himself, but his father 
seemed to sense his thought. 

“You won’t mind it, son. Really 
you won’t. The Treatment will take 
care of the whole thing. It’s per- 


47 



fectly obvious that you are suffer- 
ing from the effects of the delay 
right at this moment.” 

“Oh Chaos,” Hal swore softly. 
“Why did they have to go and put 
that element in anyway?” 

“Now Hal, you know better than 
that,” his father chided him gently. 
“It was either include a marital in- 
clination or else go in for a com- 
plete program of artificial insemina- 
tion. The women have a vote too, 
you know, and they wouldn’t hear 
of it. They don’t object to carry- 
ing a child for a few months — that’s 
always been in their conditioning 
for some reason or another. But 
they insisted that if they had to be 
mothers, the men would have to be 
fathers. And they insisted on a 
standard, civilized marriage con- 
tract to cover the situation.” 

“I know, I know. I’ve heard all 
the arguments. Racial suicide and 
all. Nonsense. We can always im- 
port Outlanders and force them to 
take the Treatment. Outlanders,” 
he pointed out with suitable, mild, 
cultured disgust, “breed like ani- 
mals.” 

“No son, that wouldn’t do the 
job. We have to keep the blood 
line. Outlanders don’t have it, you 
know. If they did, they would have 
permitted themselves to be civilized 
long ago.” 

Hal’s fingers drummed nervously 
on the desk top, and his father 
again raised an eyebrow in mild 
concern. He shook his head 
thoughtfully. 

Guiltily, Hal stopped his fingers 
from their satisfying tattoo. He 
bunched them into a fist instead, 
and then gazed at it with mild un- 

48 


belief. 

“All right,” he finally whispered. 
“This is simply awful. And it looks 
as if in order to be cured, I’ll have 
to get me a wife along with it. A 
pity, though. Everything was per- 
fectly mild without one.” 

“You’ll be mild with a wife, 
Hal,” his father assured him softly. 
“You don’t like the prospect now, 
because it means change. Change, 
of course, is always unpleasant. But 
the Treatment will take care of it 
all right. I know that I didn’t ex- 
pect things to work out so mildly 
with a wife. It was optional back 
in those days, and if it hadn’t been 
for your mother’s family money, I 
never would have married. Particu- 
larly her — with her family history 
of fecundity. As witnessed by the 
children we produced — you and 
your sister. But Formair needed the 
money, and I was the only available 
man in the Webber clan. When I 
agreed to make the sacrifice, they 
made me president of the firm, be- 
cause it isn’t often that a man will 
do so much for his own family. 
Shows real character. It’s in the 
cultured family blood, naturally.” 

Hal had heard all this many, 
many times before, but he listened 
without irritation. Or at least, with 
only the mild irritation that was the 
result of his present unstable con- 
dition. 

“Yes indeed,” his father went on 
in his mild, comfortable voice. 
“Hardly knew she was around the 
house, though, once the Treatment 
was over with. It was just as if she 
had been around all my life. Mar- 
velous process.” 

“All right,” Hal murmured. “I’ll 

E. G. VON WALD 



take it.” 

“Be a good idea to pick out a 
wife first. Sometimes there are a 
few minor adjustments to make be- 
cause of outstanding individual 
characteristics. You get an abso- 
lutely perfect fit that way, you 
know.” He stood up and walked to- 
ward the door, the flabby muscles 
of his body easily supporting the 
two pounds relative of his weight. 

“The Ansermet family has a fe- 
male available, I believe,” he mur- 
mured as he walked. “Excellent 
choice. But you better have the 
probability checked anyway.” 

“I know about her,” Hal replied 
thoughtfully. “But what’s she like? 
Have you ever met her?” 

His father smiled benignly back 
at him, as he practically floated 
through the doorway. “That doesn’t 
matter a bit,” he said mildly. “It 
doesn’t make any difference at all 
what either of you are like. The 
Treatment will bring you both back 
to absolute, statistical normal, and 
you’ll both be a perfect fit for each 
other. Quite pleasantly civilized.” 
The door hummed shut behind 
him. 

“Well,” Hal announced aloud to 
himself, “guess that’s it.” 

He ordered the automatic sec- 
retary to make all suitable arrange- 
ments and then stood up. He 
walked to the elevator, where a 
soft, hissing breeze conveyed his 
temporary one-tenth pound relative 
gently up the tube to the roof. 
There his weight returned to its 
normal two pounds relative, and 
he spoke to the robot attendant. 
“My cab.” His Formair Aircab was 
promptly and quietly delivered, and 

EASY DOES IT 


Hal stepped inside. 

“Destination?” a voice inquired 
softly from the control bank. 

“Take me to the nearest available 
Civilization Conditioning Treat- 
ment Center.” 

At once, the cab took off. It was 
a silent and comfortable motion. 
Hal had always liked flying. 

The automatic pilot was speak- 
ing to him gently. “Central Au- 
thority advises that the nearest 
available CCT Center at this time 
is in the metropolis of Knoxville. 
This requires transversing inter- 
urban wilderness.” 

Hal frowned just slightly. He 
had never seen the interurban wil- 
derness, of course, and had not the 
slightest desire to do so. That was 
chaos. He inquired, “How soon 
can the local Center take me?” 

“Three days, seven hours twenty 
minutes from reference time. Mark 
time . mark!” the robot an- 
nounced the temporal point of ref- 
erence. 

“Too long,” Hal replied wearily. 
“Let’s go to Knoxville. And shut 
off all outside views. I do not wish 
to see the chaos.” 

The Aircab obediently turned 
and transposed through the sus- 
pend-field of the York metropolis 
Airdome. It was an effortless pass- 
ing, since the field that constituted 
the wall structure of the Aircab 
was exactly in phase with that of 
the Airdome field. Both were 
Formair manufacture, of course. 

The pleasant, silent, effortless 
motion of the Aircab soon pro- 
duced its usual somnolent effect 
on him, and he dozed comfortably 
off. He slept the entire trip. 


49 



At Knoxville, he spoke to the 
Center Technician briefly, advising 
the master robot of the possibility of 
his altered economic status, and the 
matter was thoroughly checked by 
the computor at Central Authority. 
Every conceivable source of psy- 
chosomatic tension and internal 
conflict was studied, and suitable 
alterations on Hal’s master curve 
plotted. The process took ten min- 
utes, while Hal dozed under the 
soothing warmth of the examina- 
tion cap. There was a crackling 
buzz, and it was over. 

He awoke immediately, and felt 
wonderful. No tension. No irrita- 
tion. Not the slightest bit of his 
recent restlessness. Hal was de- 
lighted. On the way out of the 
cubicle, he encountered another 
Proprietor, and smiled at him with 
perfect, civilized mildness. 

“York,” he ordered his Aircab. 
Once again, the sleek button- 
shaped vehicle soared up through 
the Airdome and out over the in- 
terurban wilderness. Hal contented- 
ly went to sleep right in the middle 
of the pilot’s automatic rundown of 
flight data. 

H E WAS jolted awake by a 
raucous rattle from the control 
bank. Blinking his eyes sleepily, he 
said, “Please stop all that noise. 
What is the trouble?” 

A very unpleasant and notably 
ungentle voice replied, “Apologies 
sir. We are out of control. Aircrash 
has occurred.” 

Aircrash! An almost unheard-of 
thing that sometimes happened to 
people who used inferior equipment 

50 


like that produced by firms other 
than Form air. People were even 
known to be killed by it. 

“Report,” he said quietly, then 
flinched a little at the raucous 
scratching of the speech mecha- 
nism. 

“Reference point . mark! Al- 
titude eleven thousand three hun- 
dred seventy one feet. Velocity re- 
duced to two hundred nine point 
nine miles per hour. Locus: seven 
hundred point eight miles from 
nearest civilized metropolis, which 
is York.” The voice continued, but 
became unintelligible as the man- 
gled circuits faltered. 

Seven hundred miles from civili- 
zation! Wilderness. Chaos; that set- 
tled it, of course. Hal smiled gently 
as he realized that he was about to 
die. A civilized man obviously 
could not be expected to survive in 
chaos. He observed that he was 
breathing more strenuously, and 
realized that it was the result of 
the rapid failure of the antigravity 
field. Never in his life had Hal been 
under the full force of the earth’s 
mass field, but he knew the symp- 
toms. Once he had been exposed 
to a one-half gee for a few hours. 
Very unpleasant, he recalled. 

The automatic pilot’s unintel- 
ligible speech suddenly stopped al- 
together. There was a heavy, awk- 
ward lurch that threw Hal forward 
against the front panel. But before 
he struck it, the field generator 
failed completely, the panel ceased 
to exist, and Hal was flying through 
the air. He shut his eyes, and 
placidly waited for death. 

A moment later, he hit the 
ground sharply, rolled over and 

E. G. VON WALD 



over, and lay still. 

He sighed heavily. Death? He 
had always fancied that death 
would be a complete absence of 
sensation, and no consciousness of 
effort whatever. Instead, his breath 
was coming in deep, heavy sighs, 
his head hurt, his arm was aching, 
and something was tickling his 
nose. 

“Come on, wake up,” a voice 
said briskly. 

Hal opened his eyes and looked 
up at a golden-framed face. It was 
the face that had been speaking, 
and the pleasingly shaped lips now 
moved again. “You aren’t hurt, you 
know. Just a little shaken up.” 

Hal continued to stare at the 
woman for a moment, then mut- 
tered “Umph,” and struggled to a 
sitting posture. It was a great ef- 
fort in the unaccustomed full earth 
gravitational field. The woman 
was an Outlander, no doubt about 
it. That was evident from her high- 
ly spirited tone of voice. But as Hal 
looked around at the strange picture 
of undisturbed interurban wilder- 
ness, he found that most astonish- 
ingly he did not mind it. As a mat- 
ter of fact, he rather liked her tone 
of voice. It was all very puzzling. 

“What happened?” he muttered 
heavily, his eyes moving back to the 
landscape and the small metal 
boxes which housed the now de- 
funct suspend-field generators. 

“There must have been some- 
thing wrong with your Aircab,” she 
replied. “You crashed. The same 
way I did a couple days ago.” 
The woman walked over to the 
generator boxes, picked them up 
and brought them back to where 

EASY DOES IT 


he was still sitting on the grass. 
“We’ll need these,” she explained. 
“There are emergency supplies in- 
side them.” 

Hal didn’t move. She waited a 
moment, then said lightly, tossing 
her golden hair, “Come along now. 
We’re way out in the wilderness, 
you know, and there aren’t any 
robots to bring us our dinner.” 

“Wilderness,” Hal murmured. 
“That’s right. Well, I guess we’ll 
die here.” 

“Oh nonsense!” She stamped her 
foot with impatience. “This would 
have to happen to me. Of all peo- 
ple to be stranded with in the 
wilderness, I have to get one of you 
insipid, gutless Proprietors.” 

“Oh yes?” Hal said with un- 
conscious anger, lurching to his 
feet. “Who’s insipid and gutless? 
I’m considerably more civilized 
than you are.” Quick surprise 
crossed her face as she listened. 
Hal continued his angry speech. 
“Why is it that all you savages al- 
ways think you know how to live 
better than your superiors? If you 
are so clever, why aren’t you civi- 
lized?” 

“Well, listen to him. You sound 
almost human.” 

She was laughing at him! 

“Damn savage,” he growled. He 
turned and strode purposefully 
away from her across the soft mat- 
ting of grass. 

“Where do you think you are 
going?” she called. 

“Away from here,” he replied. 
But the rapid pace in the unac- 
customed gravity was very quickly 
taking his energy. His breath came 
in deep, labored gasps already, and 

51 



he could scarcely move his feet. 

He stopped abruptly, and looked 
at the distant horizon. There was 
nothing in sight that indicated civi- 
lization. These regions had not been 
inhabited for two hundred and 
fifty years — ever since the severance 
of the planetary colonies from po- 
litical control by the motherland, 
and the settling of the Proprietors 
into their well-separated, civilized 
cities. The land was all owned by 
the Proprietors, but was unneces- 
sary, and hence not used. 

He felt a light touch on his arm. 

“I’m sorry,” she apologized soft- 
ly. “I can understand you a little, 
but you’re so completely under the 
influence of your horrible person- 
ality conditioning methods that you 
can’t possibly understand me.” 

“Who’s under what influence?” 
Hal said in a valiant attempt to 
express his irritation, but his voice 
held the obvious weakness of fa- 
tigue. 

“You poor boy,” she sympa- 
thized. “You don’t sound very much 
influenced by it right now.” 

At her words, Hal suddenly be- 
came aware of the unaccustomed 
vigor of his own emotions, and he 
was puzzled by it. But it seemed 
oddly unimportant for some reason. 
“How come you can handle this 
awful weight so easily?” he asked 
her. 

Her laughter was light and de- 
lightful. “We spend most of our 
lives under natural conditions, not 
under an antigravity machine. I’ve 
only been on Earth for a few 
months, visiting my father. But a 
lot of that time was spent out here 
in this beautiful wilderness.” 


“Horrible chaos,” he muttered. 
He glanced up and observed a mild, 
blue, cloud-studded sky. “Why it is 
blue, after all. Isn’t it?” 

“What’s blue?” 

“The skydome.” 

She glanced up thoughtfully. “Of 
course it’s blue. And this is not one 
of your artificial skys. This is the 
real thing. There’s no artificial 
weather control out here, you 
know. You get natural sunlight, 
natural winds, storms, rain — oh, lots 
of things.” 

“Gahh,” said Hal. 

“What makes you surprised at 
finding that the sky is blue?” 

“Probably because I never saw it 
before. The only time I ever heard 
of its being anything other than 
green was when an engineer we 
have working for us at the factory 
said it was blue.” 

“Well, never mind the sky. Let’s 
find some place where we can get a 
little shelter for the night.” She be- 
gan to lead him slowly along an 
animal trail to a cluster of trees on 
a nearby stream. She walked with 
the obviously delayed pace one 
takes with invalids, but Hal had a 
difficult time keeping up. 

Finally, she said, “Here’s a pretty 
good place. Sit down next to that 
tree. You must be worn out.” 
“Oooo,” he groaned, reclining 
back against a broad, rough oak 
trunk, then stiffening painfully 
away from it again. “It doesn’t fit,” 
he mourned plaintively. 

“Now you’re sounding silly 
again,” she scolded. “Go on, lean 
back. There aren’t any suspend- 
field lounges out here for you, so 
you take what you get.”

Obediently, he relaxed against 
the rough, twisting bark. He was 
very, very tired. On second thought, 
even this rugged seat was comfort- 
able. He sighed heavily, and then 
looked pensively around again. “Oh 
well, what does it matter? We’ll be 
dead soon.” 

“Don’t talk like that!” she 
snapped with annoyance. 

“Why?” he inquired listlessly. 
“Everybody knows a civilized hu- 
man being can’t possibly survive in 
the wilderness. That’s why no one 
ever comes here. And I’d just as 
soon die right now, if you have 
anything suitable for killing.” 

The woman stared at him with a 
tight frown between her eyebrows. 
Then she shook her head with won- 
der. “How you people can call 
yourselves civilized is beyoiid me. 
You yourself don’t seem so bad, 
except that you don’t have any guts. 
They’ve trained it all out by now.” 
“Please,” begged Hal. “You 
sound like that uncouth engineer 
that works for us. Impertinent.” 
“That what engineer?” she de- 
manded spiritedly. “Who are you, 
anyway?” 

“I’m Webber. Hal Webber. The 
engineer is a savage — oh sorry.” 
He smiled weakly. “You’re a sav- 
age, too. Guess you Outlanders 
don’t regard yourselves as such.” 
“No we don’t,” she snapped. 
“And if it weren’t for us, you silly 
fools here on Earth would have 
died out long ago.” 

“Outlanders are noted for their 
misplaced pride, of course,” Hal 
commented with a mildness that 
was impelled by fatigue rather than 
civilized conditioning. 

EASY DOES IT 


“Oh are we now?” she said an- 
grily, standing up and bending over 
him. “And who do you think you 
are, Lord Proprietor? Some hum- 
ble god, perhaps? Let me tell you 
something, Hal Webber, I’ve heard 
about you. You know who I am? 
My name is Lois Bruchner. That 
uncouth engineer you just referred 
to happens to be my father.” 

Hal was puzzled. “What on earth 
is the matter?” he asked. “Why are 
you so excited?” 

“You called my father uncouth.” 
“Why get excited about that? 
After all — ” Hal gestured weakly, 
trying to reason with her, “ — it’s 
only your father. I didn’t say you 
were uncouth. Funny thing is — I 
like you.” 

“Suppose I called your father 
names?” she demanded, her lower 
lip protruding belligerently. 

“You can call him anything you 
like as far as I am concerned.” 
Lois Bruchner stood there a mo- 
ment, her mouth open in astonish- 
ment. Then she sat down beside 
him again quietly. 

“That’s right,” she murmured, 
“they even educate love out of 
you.” 

Hal sighed heavily, and slid 
away from the tree onto the rough, 
rocky ground. It was painful, but 
he was so tired. His breath came 
in regular, deep sighs as he went 
to sleep. 

B Y THE TIME he woke, Lois 
had constructed a kind of 
primitive lean-to shelter over him. 
Hal was amazed. The sheltering 
purpose of the structure was evi- 

53 



dent to him, and he was startled 
that she should have been able to 
design such a thing on the spur of 
the moment. 

She heard him stir and looked 
up from the fire she had built in 
front of the lean-to. “Hungry?” she 
asked. 

He was ravenous, but his muscles 
ached in every fibre. His wonder at 
her cleverness disappeared abrupt- 
ly when he tried to move. He rolled 
over groaning and helpless. 

Immediately, she was at his side, 
pushing him back onto the bed of 
dry, fragrant grass she had put him 
on. “Now don’t try to move 
around,” she admonished. “Just a 
few days, and you’ll be all right.” 

“Oooo,” Hal groaned. “This is 
awful.” 

“There, there,” she murmured 
solicitously. “I’ve made you some 
soup. You’ll like it.” 

“Soup,” he groaned. “I want 
food. Good solid synthomeat. Don’t 
you have any food?” 

“Solid food in your stomach so 
soon in this heavy gravity would 
kill you.” 

She went away and returned 
quickly with a little cup and spoon, 
and proceeded to empty the con- 
tainer into his lax mouth a few 
drops at a time. After a while, he 
ceased his protesting. It was less 
painful to swallow the slop than to 
fight it. Very soon afterward, he 
lost consciousness. 

Later, he was again aware of 
his surroundings. He felt tremen- 
dously better, and observed with a 
peculiar satisfaction that it was 
morning. Funny sounds were in 

54 


the air, which he eventually recog- 
nized as the cries of wild birds and 
insects. Insects? He blinked his eyes 
and struggled to a sitting position, 
and looked worriedly around. In- 
sects can carry disease, he remem- 
bered. And wild animals were re- 
ported to be carnivorous. 

His clumsy motions awakened 
Lois, who had been sleeping be- 
side him. Hal looked down at her 
with a vague wonder. Such a nice 
looking savage, he thought, as she 
popped open her eyes. She smiled 
a pleased morning smile at him and 
lazily stretched. 

“Hi,” she said. “How do you 
fefel?” 

“Quite mild,” Hal admitted with 
wonder. “Odd, too. That junk you 
fed me last night must have some 
very efficient drug in it.” 

“Junk I fed you last night?” 
Lois echoed, sitting up. Then she 
laughed her amusement. “Oh, you 
mean that soup. That wasn’t last 
night, Hal Webber. That was last 
week.” 

“But — I just woke up,” he pro- 
tested. 

“Yes.” She smiled at him, reach- 
ing up and patting his cheek af- 
fectionately. “You’ve been a little 
delirious. Gravity trauma, very 
common. You get used to it fast, 
but that’s one thing they didn’t 
condition you to, I guess, and your 
conscious prompdy rejected the 
possibility.” 

Sudden remembrance came to 
Hal of the agony it had been to 
move the last time he remembered 
trying it Cautiously he lifted an 
arm and flexed it. He glanced 
back at Lois, who was watching 

E. G. VON WALD 



him with amusement. “It feels all 
right now. Heavy and clumsy, but 
no pain.” 

“Good.” She stood up and 
brushed her unruly hair away from 
her forehead. “I’ll fix your break- 
fast just as soon as I take my bath, 
all right?” she said. Hal nodded 
absently. The stream was twenty 
yards away, and Lois walked 
quickly over to it. There she pulled 
her jumper over her head and 
dove into the crystal water. 
“Eeii, it’s cold!” she shrieked. Her 
vigorous splashing threw sharp bril- 
liance in the early morning sun- 
light. After a few minutes, she 
came out, letting the water dry on 
her soft, golden skin. 

Hal was watching her in open- 
mouthed admiration. It was a most 
remarkable sensation, this pleasure 
at seeing her 'move in that lithe, 
supple way. He had never before 
experienced such a thing. 

As she came up on the grassy 
bank, she noticed his rapt gaze, 
and quickly snatched up her single 
garment and held it in front of 
her. “All right,” she told him 
briskly. “You too. You’re much too 
big for me to handle effectively, so 
you haven’t had a decent bath 
since we got here. And it gets 
pretty hot during the day.” 

Obediently, as if in a vic-spell, 
Hal stood up and walked to the 
water’s edge, keeping his eyes on 
her. 

“Look where you’re going,” she 
said sharply, and he shook his head 
dazedly. He slowly removed his 
clothing, dropped it on the ground, 
and jumped into the water. 

That was the end of the spell 

EASY DOES IT 


The water was like ice, he howled 
like a wounded animal and tried 
to jump out again. But the gravity 
made him clumsy and he fell back 
with a great splash. He rose again, 
gasping and sputtering, making 
wild, awkward movements — in a 
frenzy to get out of the excruciat- 
ing coldness. Finally he was lying 
on the grass, panting and ex- 
hausted. 

Lois was standing over him, her 
pale blue eyes dancing with de- 
light. “What a spectacle,” she 
bubbled merrily. “You should have 
seen yourself. I sure wish I had a 
vic-o-graph with me. Such per- 
formances should be preserved.” 

Unaccountably, Hal found him- 
self gurgling like a delighted baby, 
and then laughing with her in 
loud, uncivilized guffaws. 

After a few minutes, they were 
both worn out with hilarity. Lois 
sighed. She gave him a brimming 
smile, and went en back to the 
lean-to. “Get your clothes on,” 
she said. “I’ll have some breakfast 
for you in a few minutes.” 

I T WAS FOOD, Hal agreed, but 
it was not very good. It had 
come out of the standard emer- 
gency ration from the Aircab mas- 
ter units, and no power on earth 
could have made it very palatable. 
And the supply was nearly gone. 

“I don’t know how we can get 
back,” she said thoughtfully, as she 
chewed on a wafer. “Plenty of Air- 
cabs go by — I’ve seen a dozen or 
so during the past week. But no- 
body ever looks out of them ex- 
cept Outlanders, and there aren’t 

55 



many of us around. So there isn’t 
any point in building a signal fire.” 

Hal did not reply. He lay back 
on the grass, his belly full with un- 
accustomed satisfaction, staring at 
the blue sky. He decided that he 
still preferred green. “It’s sort of a 
washed-out color,” he murmured. 
“What?” 

“The sky. It’s sort of pallid and 
weak-looking.” 

“That’s haze. But spoken like a 
big, strong man,” she said lightly. 
And then wistfully added, “A pity 
they always take it out of you.” 

Hal frowned, and looked down 
from the sky to the windblown 
dampness of her golden hair. 
“What do you mean by that?” he 
inquired. 

“Nothing.” Her gaze returned 
modestly to her wafer, and she 
continued the former subject. “We 
were talking about getting back to 
what you call civilization, remem- 
ber? Or do you prefer we become 
the new Adam and Eve lost in the 
wilderness?” she asked, her eyes 
dancing. “We could start a new 
primitive dynasty of plains sav- 
ages.” 

“Oh.” Hal’s mind came back to 
the immediate problem. “Oh, yes, 
that’s right. We have to get back.” 
He frowned a moment. “Well 
now, let’s see. There’re a number 
of emergency stations spotted 
around the interurban wilderness. 
Can’t just remember where I 
learned about them — must have 
been Treatment information.” He 
thoughtfully picked up a stick and 
began drawing diagrams of maps 
in the loose soil. “There.” He 
pointed with the stick. “One of 

56 


them should be about two hundred 
miles north of where we are now, 
provided the automatic pilot of my 
Aircab was accurate in its final 
position fix.” 

Lois was looking at the crude 
map when he glanced back up at 
her. There seemed to be a sadness 
in her expression. She nodded her 
head at the map. “From that it 
looks like those emasculating treat- 
ments do some good after all.” 

“Don’t talk like that,” he re- 
proved her. “The Civilization Con- 
ditioning Treatment is the basis of 
our culture.” 

She started to speak, hesitated, 
and then blurted out, “What, pre- 
cisely, does it do for you?” 

“Don’t you know?” Hal asked 
astonished, and then answered his 
own question. “Oh, of course, Out- 
landers would hardly know much 
about civilized history. Well, be- 
fore interplanetary exploration was 
started, there weren’t any areas at 
all like this wilderness. The planet 
was much too crowded. The people 
lived in huge, contiguous cities 
and were incessantly battling with 
each other for economic survival, 
social survival and animal survival. 
The vast majority of the popula- 
tion couldn’t stand it. They de- 
veloped all kinds of psychogenic ill- 
nesses. The impact of the uncon- 
trolled inclinations of individuals 
meeting the absolute self-control 
required by civilization was killing 
them. 

“Then, gradually, the Civiliza- 
tion Conditioning process was de- 
veloped. What happened then was 
just what you would expect — the 
people who took the Treatments 

E. G. VON WALD 



were so much better adapted to 
civilized living conditions that the 
others simply didn’t have a chance. 
Just as soon as planetary colonies 
were opened up, the savages were 
all shipped off. There were a lot 
of riots and small-scale wars for 
a while, but eventually the superior 
conditioning of the civilized people 
won out. 

“After things had stabilized 
again, anyone who wanted to was 
permitted to become an Earth citi- 
zen, but he had to take the Treat- 
ment, and keep it up. But by that 
time, most savages had a lot of 
peculiar prejudices against it, so 
the population of Earth has re- 
mained very small. The robotic 
defenses of the Proprietors pro- 
tected the planet from further in- 
vasion, and now the robotic police 
maintain order everywhere in the 
system. 

“Of course, the planets are ex- 
tremely poor in natural resources, 
so we supply the basic material, 
even though we relinquished po- 
litical control long ago. The colo- 
nies pay us by sending unusually 
gifted technicians like your father 
to work for us. Naturally, Out- 
landers have no rights, whatsoever, 
here. Not even the right to life or 
freedom or payment of the ma- 
terial allotment. But unless they 
commit a crime or otherwise inter- 
fere with the Proprietors, there is 
not the slightest danger of being 
molested by any citizen, because 
citizens are civilized.” 

Hal stopped his history lecture 
and looked back up at her. “The 
Treatment is responsible for the 
entire rational order of our cul- 


ture, as you probably know.” 

“But look how insipid it makes 
you all,” she burst out. “You’re so 
weak and wishy-washy. There isn’t 
a noble or even a strong sentiment 
in your entire society.” 

“That is how the process works. 
It is nothing but a series of checks 
and balances artificially installed in 
the subconscious which make strong 
sentiments unnecessary, and which 
prevent unstable activity. The re- 
sult is a perfectly smooth existence 
with no ups or downs, and a per- 
fect cooperation between civilized 
people.” 

Lois thought this over for a mo- 
ment. Then she asked curiously, 
“How do you account for the fact 
that you — after all the Treatments 
you have taken — are so different 
from other Proprietors? You, well 
— ” she stumbled, blushing a little 
“ — you seem perfectly normal in 
your reactions.” 

Hal shook his head. “I don’t 
know. Maybe my last Treatment 
had an error in it.” But he shook 
his head again at that idea, be- 
cause the computor at Central 
Authority never made mistakes. “It 

i c Qtranp'p ” 

“I think It’s wonderful.” She 
smiled at him with quick radiance. 

Hal grinned happily back at her, 
feeling an alien surge of joy as he 
looked at the smile and at her. 
“Well, whatever it is, for the next 
few months or so it looks like we’ll 
be savages in fact.” 

T HEY WERE. And they took a 
long time walking north to 
their destination. It was a remark- 

57 


EASY DOES IT 



ably satisfying experience for Hal. 
And it was for Lois, too, as she 
pointed out to him the night after 
they found the emergency station. 
There was a small Formair shelter 
at the place, and a simple auto- 
matic distress transmitter which 
was set in operation by one push 
of a button. Symbols marked on 
the case of the transmitter assured 
them that assistance would be 
forthcoming within twelve hours. 

It was their first night in a civi- 
lized shelter, and their last night 
together in the wilderness. Early 
the next morning, an Authority Air- 
cab came humming swiftly down 
to the meadow where they were 
waiting. 

Once inside the Aircab, Hal be- 
came taciturn and thoughtful, but 
Lois was not disturbed. She talked 
enough for both of them. Hal lux- 
uriated in the pleasant reawakened 
rapport with the things of civiliza- 
tion. 

Back at the city, they went to 
Bruchner’ s residence, and Lois’ fa- 
ther rushed outside to greet them. 
Lois ran happily to him, embracing 
him, and volubly explaining how 
wonderful Hal was, how he had 
saved her from being gobbled up 
by a lot of wild animals, and how 
strong he was, and sundry other af- 
fectionately innocuous exaggera- 
tions. Hal looked curiously on for 
a few minutes in idle wonder at 
the strange attachments of Out- 
landers. Then Lois proudly pulled 
him over next to her. 

“Isn’t he wonderful? And we’re 
in love — oh, so much in love.” 

“Lois,” Bruchner mumbled un- 
happily. “There are some things you 

58 


have to be told. I should have 
told you before — ” 

“You don’t have to tell me any- 
thing,” she bubbled happily. “You 
can say all you want to about the 
Proprietors, but this one is differ- 
ent. He’s — he’s real!” 

Hal laughed diffidently, and 
moved a little further away from 
her. He gazed around at the city, 
recognizing it with thirsty famili- 
arity, happily part of it again. The 
experience of the past three months 
already seemed far away. 

“Hal,” Lois murmured, suddenly 
aware of his rapidly growing cool- 
ness. “Hal, darling, what’s wrong?” 

“Why nothing at all, uh, Lois.” 
He looked at her uncomfortably 
for a moment, and backed a step 
further. “It’s just — well, you 
know.” 

“Oh no you don’t,” she cried, 
rushing up to him and grabbing his 
arm. “Where are you going — 
Dad!” 

“Please, Miss Bruchner,” Hal 
murmured mildly, disengaging his 
arm from her. He gazed hungrily 
around him again the moment she 
let go, and looked back at her only 
when he was startled by a sudden, 
choking sob. Lois was staring at 
him, her fist to her mouth, the 
pale blue eyes brimming. 

“Oh no!” she cried tremulously. 

“Lois,” Bruchner said, his voice 
sounding harsh with repressed emo- 
tions, “come in here. You’ve got to 
know what the situation is.” He 
put his arm around her trembling 
shoulders and led her off, glaring 
at Hal in helpless fury. 

The moment they were out of 
sight, Hal turned and stepped back 

E. G. VON WALD 



into the Aircab. He ordered it to 
take him home. His parents were 
there, watching a vic-entertain- 
ment, which Hal promptly turned 
off. 

“Who did that?” his father 
mumbled, coming immediately out 
of the trance. “Hal? That wasn’t 
a very nice thing to do, son.” 
“Why Hal,” his mother sighed 
mildly. “You’re not dead after all. 
How nice. Don’t pay any attention 
to your father — it wasn’t a very in- 
teresting vie anyway.” 

“Shouldn’t turn it off like that, 
though.” 

“Um, sorry,” Hal apologized 
gently. He relaxed into the com- 
fortable, perfect fit of a Formair 
lounge. “Just thought I’d let you 
know I’m still alive.” 

“Well, we’re glad,” his mother 
murmured absently. “Must have 
been pretty awful.” 

“That’s the funny thing about it, 
though — I didn’t mind it a bit at 
the time. Very curious. I had an 
Outlander woman with me — 
Bruchner’s daughter, as a matter 
of fact.” 

“Oh dear,” Mrs. Webber sighed. 
“Poor Hal.” 

“Well, like I say, it wasn’t exact- 
ly mild, but it was quite tolerable, 
somehow.” He frowned just slight- 
ly, and shook his head at the puz- 
zling incongruity. He recalled his 
three months of association with 
the uncivilized woman, somewhat 
wistfully contemplating strong, 
overpowering sentiments in a chao- 
tic wilderness. “Anyway,” he said 
at last, “I’m home again, and it’s 
all over. I won’t have to have any- 
thing to do with her now.” 

EASY DOES IT 


“Yes,” Mrs. Webber murmured. 
“Odd that you should have sur- 
vived though, isn’t it? I thought a 
civilized man in the wilderness 
would die almost at once.” 

Webber gave the cultured 
equivalent of a mild snort. “Of 
course he could survive. Oh — ” 
and he laughed softly in apology 
“ — that’s right. I forgot to tell 
you about that.” 

The eyes of his wife politely 
turned to him and he explained. 
“A couple of weeks after our son 
here apparently had been killed, I 
happened to run into an Authority 
physician. I mentioned it to him, 
just in passing. He told me that 
there was a factor in the CG Treat- 
ment that provided for such 
things. 

“It seems that the Civilization 
Conditioning they give you is only 
designed to enable a man to sur- 
vive in a city. In order for the 
conditioning to function, you have 
to have that civilized urban en- 
vironment. Once the environment 
is removed, the conditioned com- 
plex has nothing to react against, 
and the man immediately becomes 
almost — but not quite — as savage 
as a typical Outlander. 

“That way, a civilized man can 
always manage to live in the wil- 
derness, given half a chance. Once 
he gets back into a city again, the 
proper, civilized environment is re- 
turned, the conditioning starts 
functioning immediately and pres- 
to! — the man is civilized again.” 
“Well now, that’s nice,” Mrs. 
Webber said placidly. “Wouldn’t 
like to see my boy dead.”

As secretary , receptionist and 
general nursemaid to them 1 took 
it upon myself to dig back through 
the news files and get enough clips 
to tell their history from birth un- 
til they opened the school . You’ve 
all read it so there’s no need to go 
into details about their strange 
life and still stranger birth . Nor 
their magnificent education or still 
more magnificent gifts . It’s true , 
every bit of it; their telepathic and 
ESPing powers WORKED. They 


were the only births like them to 
survive to maturity and beyond . 

During the last contact I had 
with them (I was their first and 
most advanced pupil) it came as 
pure inspiration to take down their 
transmissions in the special short, 
shorthand we developed for use 
among the pupils and ourselves . 
What follows may be added to the 
story told by the news clips, differ- 
ing only in person. 1 have added 
nothing in translation of the notes.

leaving the narrative as disjointed 
as they gave it. The events are as 
they transmitted them, as they 
lived them . I was in contact with 
them until — but read, and when 
you’re through reading do as 1 do 
every night . 

Pray. 

And hope — for mankind . 

W ELL, Kitten, it seems impos- 
sible that three grand, suc- 
cessful years of work could end so 
suddenly with us lying in a ditch 
or anticipating, ESPwise, an oc- 
casional bullet fired from the guns 
of friends but there it is. God, 
what a complicated being this so- 
called modem man is! He seems to 
be born cloaked with complexities 
which get even more complex as 
he grows. No wonder he has been 
so long on the road, being engaged 
in a continual battle between ethics 
and emotions as he has. 

So here we are, the bridge, the 
first rungs of a ladder leading to a 
new and delightful plane of exist- 
ence for all mankind, wallowing in 
the mud of an irrigation ditch in- 
stead of glorying in the divine 
world of the mind. If we can but 
make them see! Maybe the profes- 
sors were right when they told us to 
teach under the protection of the 
university instead of hardheadedly 
going out on our own. 

Princess, do you remember Lu- 
cille? She was our best pupil, after 
you, of course. She’s the one who 
turned over the stone that freed 
our personal gremlin. Oh, it’s not 
really her fault, though she did 
break our one and only cardinal 

62 


rule by bringing in an outsider her- 
self instead of leaving such choices 
to us. Actually the fault was ours 
because — well, who knows? That 
wonderful control we practiced for 
so many years slipped, no matter 
the reason. It was just one of those 
inexplicably foolish things people 
will do when they think they’re in 
love. Guess we thought we could 
save her some embarrassment or 
some such thing. 

You had just left on a long vaca- 
tion when that one showed up. He 
was the man that Lucille brought 
up with her as a prospective pupil, 
the one that — one wing of them is 
closing in on us now. Kitten. We’ll 
have to try for the swamp ahead 
of us. We’ll have to lose them for 
a while if we want time to figure a 
way out, though we aren’t really 
very good at this sort of cat and 
mouse game. We can give our own 
boys a little credit, though. They 
aren’t really trying to hit us. They 
shoot well enough to be able to 
make it look very good. All we 
really have to worry about is Thur- 
low and his trained deputy, 
Trainor. 

There, that was nice. The sheriff 
himself just spotted us and started 
a pincer movement — fifty yards in 
back of us. Good old boy. Hope he 
doesn’t get in trouble over us. 

At last! If this patch of swampy 
brush is really as thick as we ESP 
it we’re made, providing the high- 
way troopers of this state don’t 
get too smart and take over the 
operation. Our sheriff is in charge 
so far. Lord, if we only weren’t so 
tired! 

Anyhow, Lucy brought Thurlow 

NEIL J. KENNEY 



in and we gave him the usual treat- 
ment. The only trouble is we over- 
did it slightly and it scared him. 
Besides telling him what he had for 
breakfast we ESPed his wallet and 
told him its contents and when he 
reached for it in a sort of stunned 
reflex action we levitated it into 
his hand. It was a pretty big mis- 
take in view of the fact that he was 
one of that bunch that was fairly 
sensitive mentally, but whom we 
couldn’t read thoroughly. We could 
telepath only the very surface of 
his mind. He would have made a 
wonderful adept with the proper 
training. 

He was awed but shocked and 
scared, too. It was outside his realm 
of experience and he was super- 
stitious in spite of his fine educa- 
tion. Some folks don’t let learning 
sink in to open the rusty locks of 
prejudice and inhibition. 

He said things that bared his 
mind as surely as if we had read 
him. It wasn’t a pretty mind, 
either. It made us sick physically 
and the impulses that did come 
through were deep and angry, giv- 
ing us a terrific headache and 
making it hard to concentrate. 
Later we followed him but still 
couldn’t read him for the anger 
flashes blotted out his thought 
stream thoroughly. 

To him, what we were doing 
just couldn’t happen in good old 
1983. We were dealing in the black 
arts and he told us as much, re- 
fusing to listen to reason in any 
shape. The fact that everyone has 
these capabilities latent was alto- 
gether lost on him. Our licenses, 
diplomas and degrees meant less 

THEY WERE DIFFERENT 


than nothing and the longer he 
went on the more rabid he got, 
frothing obscenely about such 
things as tampering with forces bet- 
ter left alone and man thinking 
with his brains instead of letting 
the Prince of Darkness do it for 
him. Had it not been so serious it 
would have been almost slapstick. 
Instead he was tragic. 

When he got to the part about 
us eventually filling the minds of 
children with our loathsome dis- 
ease he ran out of expletives and 
stormed out of the office in a cloud 
of anger and fright, muttering that 
we hadn’t heard the last of him. 

Lucy, of course, was heartsick. 
We didn’t have to tell her what 
the meeting had meant. Nor did 
we tell her what else we’d ESPed in 
Thurlow’s wallet. She found that 
out during the rather abortive les- 
son we tried to give her for she 
read as we interrupted it (that 
shows how much off beam we were 
because we just don’t do that) to 
take a phone call from Casey down 
at the sheriff’s office. Our visitor, 
Thurlow, was District Judge Thur- 
low of District Two, a very high 
man on the law enforcement pole. 

Casey was good. He’d listened in 
while Thurlow was complaining to 
the sheriff and apparently heard 
the sheriff read the judge off po- 
litely but nonetheless firmly, telling 
him first how valuable we were 
to the force when it came to inter- 
rogating hard-to-crack suspects 
and as long as we hadn’t com- 
mitted murder or rape or passed 
any bum checks there was nothing 
to be done. Especially since the 
judge His Honor was out of his dis- 

63 



trict! Fortunately we were in Dis- 
trict One over which our mutual 
friend, Judge Kimball, presides. 

Incidentally, Kimball was still 
under doctor’s care at the time due 
to his latest heart attack. He was 
getting along quite well but he was 
old and his days on the bench 
were pretty well numbered. Casey 
thought that District One might 
conceivably have to appoint a new 
judge to hold them over until elec- 
tion due to the fall court calendar. 
As it turned out that didn’t hap- 
pen. 

Br-r-r! Princess, don’t ever let 
anyone tell you that swamp water 
can’t get cold in summertime. 
We’ve got the shakes pretty bad 
both from our ordeal and from 
chill. Getting uncomfortably hun- 
gry, too. That’s what comes of let- 
ting an inferior enemy panic you. 
We certainly haven’t acted as 
though we had better sense. It’s 
just another of those imponderables 
to chalk up for study. 

After Casey’s call the air seemed 
to be cleared and under that driv- 
ing compulsion which has never 
left us we went on about the busi- 
ness of trying to succeed with na- 
ture since she had succeeded so well 
with us. The study of the deep 
processes of the mind eclipsed the 
next two days and only the terrible 
jangle of that outmoded telephone 
brought us to the surface again. 
It’s too bad that we had to con- 
verse orally with the great masses 
of the untrained. It’s so slow and 
they could learn so easily. 

It was Casey again, telling us we 
were needed down at the station. 
He was apparently calling us on 


blind orders, for he couldn’t tell 
us what was up. Figuring that we 
had another prisoner to crack we 
closed classes and drove down. The 
sheriff seemed mystified, too, and 
just slightly troubled. We could 
read that much off the surface of 
his mind, but he was upset enough 
to make the rest of his thoughts a 
meaningless jumble of impulses. All 
he knew was that we were wanted 
in the judge’s chambers. 

You guessed it, Honey. It was 
Judge Thurlow filling in for Kim- 
ball on an emergency hearing and 
he figured it was his duty to man- 
kind to give us a little talking to 
while he was there. After all, the 
good of the community was his con- 
cern now, and he chose to interpret 
that as the opportunity to place 
his narrow little views on record. 
Trainor, the sheriff’s deputy faith- 
ful only to the judge, because of a 
favor granted while he served in 
Thurlow’s district, was very busy 
signing his name to something when 
we walked into the chambers. It 
gave us a peculiar feeling to see 
Thurlow sitting at Kimball’s desk. 
It bore out our theory about a 
room taking on the personality of 
its occupant. This room was no 
longer warm and friendly. 

The only thing we could read 
from Thurlow was a self-righteous 
anger and a solemn, nasty vow to 
fight us to the last ditch — which, 
incidentally, he has done for that 
irrigation ditch is the last one we 
ever wish to occupy. That water 
was miserably cold. 

Three guesses what Trainor was 
signing. Of all things, a complaint 
charging us with questionable edu-

cational technique! The one thing 
not covered by license, as Thurlow 
made haste to confirm through the 
State House, and by Trainor’s com- 
plaint, the one way we could legal- 
ly come into his hands. It was a 
dainty little frame but unbreakable. 
Spreading a sweet legal shovel he 
asked us questions that minutely 
covered every phase and method 
of our teaching, then smiled a 
nasty smile, the while fixing his own 
signature to another wisp of terribly 
binding paper. A restraining order. 

The words of which forbade us 
to teach! We were to suspend our 
life’s work or suffer the punishment 
for contempt of court because of a 
narrow-minded, righteously wrath- 
ful mental prude! 

How can you fight something like 
that? Thurlow was the last and 
highest branch of authority in the 
area unless we took it to Supreme 
Court. For a while we were tempted 
to do that but on what were we 
to base a case? Public opinion 
would throw us out of court if the 
Supreme Justice didn’t. 

We talked to the sheriff when 
we came down and he and his boys 
were on our side — emotionally. 
Legally they had to carry out the 
judge’s orders to place us under 
institutional restraint if we trans- 
gressed. In short, we would be 
tossed in the pokey if we thumbed 
our noses at the order. 

The sheriff’s advice was to sus- 
pend operations until Supreme 
Court sat and take it to them. 
When we asked if he and his staff 
would be witnesses for us — well, 
that’s water under the oft men- 
tioned bridge. There are some ugly 

THEY WERE DIFFERENT 


facets of politics that force the 
men playing them to act as they do. 
Otherwise we surely wouldn’t have 
been refused. So there we were; 
no witnesses — no case; because we 
couldn’t bring our pupils into it. It 
was an uncertain mess at best and 
we didn’t want them to get it in 
the neck along with us. For the 
same reason we couldn’t involve our 
former teachers at the university. 
What poor payment for hours of 
drudgery to be dragged into a court 
battle ! 

So with the sheriff’s advice to go 
into another business ringing in our 
ears, we came back home to sweat 
it out and think. It took a while, 
but the only answer we felt was 
right under the circumstances was 
to go underground. That makes it 
sound like the dark ages, doesn’t it. 
Princess, when knowledge has to 
hide and creep and skulk instead 
of flowering under the sun? Our 
gifts couldn’t be let go to waste, not 
after the preparation and develop- 
ment that went into expanding 
them into a workable set of psychic 
senses. We had to give Man the 
benefit of our awakening by waking 
him in turn. 

It’s much too bad that we were 
so sheltered at the university. We 
might have had some practical ex- 
perience with the world and its 
people. We might also have known 
what to do about this awful hunger 
that is gradually tearing us down. 
It’s getting to be a serious problem 
in our untrained condition. The 
prof’s wouldn’t even let us play 
handball for fear of injury so con- 
sequently we’re nothing but a liv- 
ing cliche, skin and bones. Donald 

65 



feels it strongly. We shall have to 
try to buoy each other and go on 
our combined reserves. Pray that we 
don’t get too weak. It’s been almost 
24 hours since we’ve eaten, as there 
wasn’t time for breakfast. Our 
clothes seem to be drying slightly 
though it’s still cool enough to make 
it uncomfortable and dangerous. 
This is the way colds grab you. 

We did pretty well in our choice 
of an underground location — we 
thought. Our mistake was in over- 
looking the police trained mind 
of our bloodhound friend, Trainor. 
He’s a shrewd man and not unin- 
telligent though sadly misguided. 
How we should like to have him 
on our side! 

In five days of sniffing around he 
had us located, and in another, he 
had enough proof of activity to re- 
port to Thurlow and come after 
us with a bench warrant of arrest. 
It’s peculiar that we couldn’t stall 
him or dodge him some way with 
our much touted IQ, but probably 
we were still too naive about hu- 
man relations and most assuredly 
unversed in the devious twistings 
of the police mind. After all, though 
we’re twenty-six years old, our ex- 
perience with people put us in 
about the three year old class. So 
you see? Were it to begin all over 
again the outcome would be dif- 
ferent. We would be more practical 
and worldly. You learn. 

There was no sense fighting him, 
because he had the law enforce- 
ment agencies of the whole state in 
back of him. All he had to do was 
whisper “Sic ’em” and we were 
dead. So we went along quietly to 
see Thurlow and that dear man 


took a singularly fiendish delight in 
imposing an impossible fine on us 
for contempt of court Our particu- 
lar transgression wasn’t definitively 
covered by law so neither was the 
fine. The fact that Thurlow was 
fining us for teaching methods in- 
stead of the contempt charge didn’t 
dawn on us until just yesterday. 
How completely ignorant can you 
get? 

He gave us a pretty, self- 
righteous speech about the good 
of the community and a judge’s 
place in it, mentioning in passing 
that everything wasn’t covered by 
law so it was up to the judge to 
handle matters as he saw fit. That 
was what he was trained and 
elected for and that was what he 
was doing. Nothing personal, un- 
derstand. As it was, and well he 
knew it, we couldn’t begin to pay 
the fine so we were informed that 
we’d have to sit it out in the county 
jail at the rate of two dollars a day. 

The fine was five hundred dol- 
lars. 

The sheriff almost cried when 
he found we were to be taking ad- 
vantage of his hospitality. Very 
likely the full injustice of the 
judge’s complacent little scheme 
finally got through to him. At any 
rate, sympathy or not, we had eight 
months and ten days to serve with 
time off possible for good behavior. 
That’s where you found us when 
you finished your vacation and dis- 
covered you were temporarily out 
of a job. 

Donald took quick advantage of 
a prisoner’s rights to telephone 
Judge Kimball. He was still in bed 
but sounded fairly strong. His con- 

NEIL J. KENNER 


66 



sternation over our new address was 
touching and real, but we were 
sadly informed that ethically the 
whole matter was beyond him. 
When Thurlow sat in for him in 
his district, then Thurlow was law 
and no reversal could be had out- 
side of the due process of that law 
through a higher court. He, Kim- 
ball, could do nothing until he 
could get back on the bench. That 
might be several weeks yet as he 
wasn’t to get out of bed or get 
excited in any way. 

We hung up and had our first 
look at the familiar cells from the 
prisoner’s viewpoint. The change in 
oudook was subtle but definite. The 
walls looked grayer. 

Hope we’re not boring you with 
all this, Kitten, but we must tell 
it to someone and you are closest 
and dearest to us. You missed out 
on nearly all our doings after we 
closed the school so call it a filling- 
in process. Someone should have 
the full story although what good 
it will ever do is debatable. Perhaps 
at some future time we can do 
something with it — if we get out of 
the present jackpot. 

Got to move. The state police 
have taken over the operation and 
our sheriff is relegated to the role 
of visiting fireman. It’s lamentable 
that we aren’t in his bailiwick. 
Things might work out better. 

These troopers are very efficient. 
Donald ESPs them folding a cor- 
don around our end of the swamp. 
All we can do is head through its 
length now. Trainor is with them. 
Thurlow has joined them also. We 
get a tiny jab of pain as we pass 
over him. That impossible man! 

THEY WERE DIFFERENT 


Naturally our pupils fell off, 
thinking the school completely shut 
down, until you visited us and were 
able to pass the word that discreet 
visits wouldn’t go unrewarded. 
Only a few drifted back for deeper 
learning and expansion, as you 
know. One happy thing about the 
others who were afraid to come 
back is that they would still make 
progress, having once been awak- 
ened, though it would be infinitely 
slow and groping. The nucleus that 
sat with us on those once a week 
school days grew stronger very 
rapidly, for knowledge is cumula- 
tive and progressive, and they be- 
gan to realize what they in turn 
had to do when they were ready. 
Credit must be given their strength 
of mind for seeing and accepting 
such a responsibility with the en- 
thusiasm they showed. 

It was too good to last. Trainor’s 
turn at afternoon shift came around 
and lasted the usual month which 
gave him plenty of opportunity to 
watch us like a hawk. He did. We 
were cautious but we couldn’t know 
what he was watching for, because 
he didn’t know either. He found 
out one afternoon. Visitors just 
don’t come around and merely sit 
— staring at each other or the walls. 

We learned another lesson from 
that: men with as much training 
as he had don’t always consciously 
think things out with their surface 
minds. Their reactions became in- 
stinctive and as such, untraceable 
by the most adept telepath. We 
knew he was there to spy but that’s 
about all. 

The net result was a direct order 
from Thurlow cutting off not only 

67 



all visitors, but as Trainor gleefully 
advised us, cancelling all accrued 
days off for good behavior. That’s 
five days a month in this state and 
it was almost unbearable. The thor- 
ough injustice of the whole affair 
was beginning to gall mightily, get- 
ting under our rather thin skin in 
many places. 

What seemed the final crushing 
blow was the news that filtered in 
to us from Judge Kimball’s court 
reporter. He’d taken word to the 
sick man about our latest loving 
treatment by Thurlow and it an- 
gered Kimball enough to make him 
get out of bed — too soon. He died 
on the floor of his bedroom. So, not 
only do we lose a dear friend, but 
also any chance of his assistance. 
Thurlow would now sit for Dis- 
trict One until election time. That 
put us entirely on our own re- 
sources. 

After much deliberation, we de- 
cided to give in and go back to the 
university when our sentence was 
up and take advantage of its shel- 
tering walls for our teaching. We 
would be absorbed into the faculty 
and soon all this unpleasantness 
would pass over. 

How we passed the time until 
our release is unimportant to any- 
one but us. During the remaining 
months, we delved farther and far- 
ther into the mind and gained a 
much deeper insight into the work- 
ings of these gifts we had. Man 
could be so powerful and work so 
much for his own good — if he 
could only be made to realize the 
potential in his mind! He could 
even be happy. 

The bright day came at last, and 

68 


we walked out of our cell free to 
begin again. It was raining a gray 
rain outside, but to us the weather 
had never looked brighter. As we 
reached for the sheriff’s phone to 
call the university, Trainor sidled 
up and laid a scrap of paper on 
the desk. A glance was enough to 
make us hang up on the uncom- 
pleted call. 

It was another restraining order. 

After that we tried to find work 
on the outside, but it was a sorry 
failure. The curse of being different 
is a mighty one indeed. No one 
seemed to care that we had feelings 
the same as others and that we 
could get just as hungry and thirsty 
without funds to buy. 

Ahh! There it is again. Those 
words. Hunger and thirst. As if we 
needed a reminder. Donald is get- 
ting weaker in perception. He has 
always been the first to feel such 
things and we’ve never been able 
to trace the reason. We certainly 
have no — 

1 interject at this point, for tele- 
pathic contact with them broke un - 
explainably . 1 prayed for their 
safety for I suddenly knew what it 
would mean to lose them . What a 
drab, dreary, bigoted world it would 
be without them to teach us and 
help us. 

God, that was a bad half hour, 
Puss. These troopers are so well 
trained that they’re more tele- 
pathically dead than you can imag- 
ine. First, Donald was so weak he 
let one of them sneak up close 
enough for a quick rifle shot. It 
missed, but of course it told exactly 

NEIL J. KENNEY 



where we were. Donald exerted 
himself and ESPed locations, find- 
ing that we had enough time to 
work on the trooper if we hurried. 
Normally we’d be no match for 
him but desperation can work won- 
ders. We resorted to a base form 
of trickery by affecting to surrender 
to him. When he came up to put 
the cuffs on us, we played dirtier by 
offering him a knee that will keep 
him from attending his wife for a 
few days. Rotten trick, but we 
couldn’t afford to let him get his 
hands on us or it would have been 
all finished. That makes another 
count against us. We left his rifle 
out of reach and ran. 

Fortunately the others milled 
around for a precious minute or two 
when they found him, giving us 
still more time. Before they got 
moving again, we broke cover and 
made it across a county road into 
a farmer’s barn where we burrowed 
into the hay. We’ll stay here a while 
to rest. Not being the athletic type 
we sure need it. 

To go back, our small supply of 
money was running dangerously 
low in spite of miserly budgeting. 
We didn’t know what to do outside 
of robbing a bank to get more. 
Then it happened. 

We were browsing through the 
library one day, when Donald 
ESPed a stack of returned books 
not yet filed hoping to turn up 
something new. The stack was 
mixed, holding such things as a 
treatise on grinding optical lenses, 
a copy of “Gone With the Wind”, 
a couple of western novels, a thin 
edition of “The Purloined Letter” 
and several volumes for the home 


craftsman. Evidently some newly- 
weds were doing things to their 
well mortgaged dream house. 

On the way home, Donald’s idea 
burst in on both of us like some 
monstrous flashbulb. With our 
minds being so perfectly tuned 
through constant work during the 
years, what one ESPed the telepath 
had immediately and what one 
telepathed the ESPer received at 
once. It was a fine working agree- 
ment and became as habitual as 
breathing. Donald’s idea was beau- 
tiful for all that it was lifted from 
another man. Its application was 
what burnished it to that bright lus- 
ter of originality. 

We would go to work in a carni- 
val! If a man could hide a letter 
in an open letter rack, where better 
could we be hidden but in a car- 
nival? It was wonderful. 

We had no trouble getting into 
one. The owner took one look at 
what we could do and told us the 
answer mentally by wondering how 
little he could offer and still get us. 
It gave us a certain bargaining 
point but at our stage of the game 
all we wanted was in. The thought 
crossed our minds that we might 
be lowering our station in life but 
we were past caring. 

And of course we found out how 
wrong we were, that “station in 
life” is just a point of view. To out- 
siders carnies are a hard lot, in- 
terested in nothing but the quickest 
way to part the suckers from a 
dollar. Well, they were hard, to 
outsiders, but to those inside there 
is a difference. We found some 
mighty fine people and some very 
fertile minds. 


THEY WERE DIFFERENT 


69 



We enjoyed the first real secur- 
ity we’d known for a long time. We 
found friendship and a certain 
amount of fame as moneymakers 
for the show. We got a raise after 
working on the boss for a while. 
Best of all we lost ourselves in the 
bustle of the show. 

Shortly after our admission into 
the ranks of the carnies, we felt 
safe enough to put out feelers (we 
were out of the state by then), 
mental this time, prodding small 
ideas into the best minds, giving 
them the urge to ask us questions 
of a leading nature and so eventual- 
ly we began another class in tele- 
pathy, Esp, and their related sub- 
jects. As we traveled from state to 
state we picked up new pupils from 
other shows and lost others to the 
same shows, but the running count 
was about twenty most of the time. 

We had to be so very careful in 
our selections for fear of a repeti- 
tion of our former mishaps, but it 
went well. We made no mistakes 
and turned out some fine pupils, one 
in particular. He progressed fast 
enough in the short time we had 
him to become acutely adept, and 
when we told him he was ready to 
teach he accepted it by leaving the 
carnival to settle down with a home 
and wife. It was good to see the 
fruit of our work being put into 
practice. 

Next season, we found that in 
the first pass across the country we 
were booked for the north end of 
our home state. For the first time 
in nearly two years we would be on 
almost familiar ground. 

You know what happened then, 
Baby. You ought to. You were the 

70 


one we contacted. Telepathy is a 
lot better than a telephone, isn’t it? 

What you might not know is 
that our contact with you was an- 
other step in this whole sickening 
drama. How were we to suspect 
that the train ticket agent was one 
of those tenacious, bespectacled fel- 
lows who doggedly chewed on an 
idea until it made sense to him? 
Who would know that he was one 
of those spiteful, small people who 
enjoyed doing his civic duty as he 
saw it? 

He wondered why so many peo- 
ple were taking the same train on 
the same day to the same place, 
when it had never happened be- 
fore. People just don’t travel three 
hundred miles to take in a one 
horse carnival. 

Being a small town he knew most 
of the folks by name — or at least 
by sight — and he recalled that you, 
sweet, were once our secretary. 

Imagine the excitement he felt 
at having such a momentous thing 
happen in his dull and uneventful 
life. How best to savour the taste 
of it? Why, call the sheriff*, natural- 
ly. Oh, it must have been delicious. 
Let’s hope he enjoys the memory. 

With our luck it was out of the 
question to have anyone but Train- 
or answer the phone — and swing 
into high gear. Apparently Judge 
Thurlow had run for District One 
during the election and made it, 
giving up his own stamping grounds 
for some reason. It hardly seems 
possible that he’d do it just on the 
hope that we might decide to come 
home and set up shop. No man 
could be that vindictive, could he? 
Or are we still much too naive to 


NEIL J. KENNEY 



be allowed out without a keeper? 
Who knows? 

We do know that the group was 
followed by Trainor and another 
man at Thurlow’s orders; and 
when they saw all of you meet at 
a certain tent in back of the mid- 
way all they had to do was sneak 
close enough to hear that there was 
exactly nothing going on! We were 
all so excited at seeing each other 
that their presence went unnoticed. 
Besides, what need to exercise cau- 
tion when there wasn’t an un- 
friendly face within miles? 

When Trainor made his tele- 
phone call to get the permission to 
arrest us on the strength of another 
bench warrant Thurlow prepared 
in a hurry, his emotions penetrated 
our little circle; but not soon 
enough for everyone to get out safe- 
ly. It all happened so suddenly that 
our lifelong control snapped. The 
persecution was so sneaking and so 
needless! 

It didn’t take long to dispose of 
the two deputies. Desperation again 
and thick anger. We lost no time 
in trussing them solidly and leaving 
them unconscious. After it was 
over, we realized what a deadly 
game it had suddenly become. We 
were in deep trouble again — deep- 
er than any that had gone before. 
And we needed time, lots of it. 

Take our word for it. Kitten, and 
stay underground during any time 
you and the others may teach. It’s 
your duty to use care, because you 
certainly won’t be able to advance 
your state of learning or help others 
while under detention. Keep in 
touch with the others. Your ranks 
will fill, if you can succeed unde- 

THEY WERE DIFFERENT 


tected until it’s time to come into 
the open. 

Don’t get into our fix; don’t be 
forced into breaking the law. We 
didn’t break it by teaching sup- 
posedly Satanic courses but by ig- 
noring the restraining order, then 
by beating up the police and run- 
ning. Running wasn’t too bad in 
itself, but it made it tougher when 
in our shocked haste we took a car 
that didn’t belong to us. Then, too, 
we shouldn’t have taken it across 
the state line. That made it a 
federal offense. Even if the troopers 
get us, we shall first be guests of 
the FBI. Sweet mess, isn’t it? 

Lordy, this hay is dry. It’s sweet 
smelling and comfortable lying here 
but it’s dry and dusty. It’ll be too 
bad if nature gives us away through 
a tickling nose. We can do without 
her tricks now. 

Donald has just ESPed a water 
trough in back of the barn. We 
must take a chance on it. This rag- 
ing thirst is as crippling as the lack 
of food. 

We drove in a huge circle and 
left the car well before morning; 
continuing on foot in the general 
direction of our friend who had 
left the carnival to teach. It was 
our hope to be able to stay there 
until things cooled down. 

We finally made it, tired and 
hungry, and got the welcome we 
expected. He was overjoyed to see 
us. You’ll never know how cosy 
and warm that house felt or how 
utterly good was the smell of bak- 
ing bread. His wife is a jewel. 

We received a jolt the next 
morning before breakfast. The 
neighbor’s little girl came bursting 

71 



Into the house in what apparently 
was her normal fashion while we 
were teaching a small class that 
our friend had collected. She was 
extraordinarily sensitive and our 
combined minds made a terrific 
impact on her perception before we 
could control it. 

Her eyes opened and she was all 
for broadcasting to every child in 
the block, but Donald got us 
through a sticky moment. He made 
it her own personal secret in a way 
that only children can appreciate 
and then showed her one of the 
simpler tricks of ESP. She grasped 
it at once for children are extraordi- 
narily susceptible to instruction. 
Their minds haven’t had the 
chance to get cluttered by inhibi- 
tions and conventional thoughts. 
She was wide-eyedly delighted and 
promised her cross-my-heart prom- 
ise that no one would ever know 
about us. 

But of course, they did. Parents 
being what they are, it was foolish 
to assume that an untrained child 
could keep the signs of her adven- 
ture from them. The signs pointed 
to a story and it didn’t take them 
long to pry it out of her. It wasn’t 
the girl’s fault. The adult odds were 
against her. 

They poked and prodded at her 
for the cause of her overly bright 
eyes and animated spirit, until the 
poor child was overwrought and 
blurted out the details of her im- 
mense find. The mother was at 
once sympathetic to her and us, 
bless her, but not so the father. 
They both knew she wasn’t imagin- 
ing it because of the stories they’d 
heard of us over the years and the 

72 


father blew up. We could sense 
the whole tableau telepathically, 
dreading the outcome, knowing 
what it must be. 

The father stormed about the 
house crying death and destruction 
on us, while the mother tried to get 
him to listen to reason. He was 
mentally incapable of doing it. He, 
like so many of the others, was ter- 
ribly frightened at the unknown, 
fearsome thing in their midst. It 
was unthinkable that we should 
stay free of captivity when there 
were places for people like us! We 
shouldn’t be allowed to mingle with 
normal, decent folks. The upshot 
was a long distance, collect phone 
call to the judge who doubtless ac- 
cepted the charges quite happily. 

We couldn’t stay, so we turned 
to run once more. 

That’s about all there is, Princess. 
We’ve run until we can hardly run 
any more. We’re weak and hungry 
and sickened by the hatred and 
stupid, active resistance surround- 
ing us. We don’t blame the police. 
They’re merely doing what they are 
paid to do. 

Donald has ESPed them filtering 
through the swamp in a wide semi- 
circle and a few thoughts are leak- 
ing through the jumble of shouted 
orders and mixed impulses. Trainor 
and the judge are right with them. 
He seems to be talking earnestly to 
Trainor but his hatred and anger 
blot everything out — we can get 
nothing from him. Donald is get- 
ting weaker, but we must stir to 
get water and try to leave before 
they see this bam. 

Here the narrative broke once

more for more than an hour, leav- 
ing me in an agonized, hopeless sus- 
pense, knowing there was no way 
to help them. Occasionally I sensed 
a faint stirring in my mind as 
though they were trying to get 
through to me and once a deep 
stab of sorrow amounting almost to 
pain. It was getting quite late in 
the evening before they came 
through once more, weakly but still 
clearly and coherently . 

It’s hard to concentrate. The am- 
bulance is jerking and bounding 
along and the pain is frightful. 
Looking back, there was no other 
way for it to end. They were too 
many and too dedicated, while we 
were only us and on the run, not 
even on the defensive. 

Our physical weakness became 
painfully apparent when we cau- 
tiously ventured out back to find 
the water trough, drank, and stum- 
bled away from our pursuers for a 
quarter of a mile right into the 
hands of six waiting state police- 
men. We’d been so intent on the 
men in the swamp, so blanketed by 
Thurlow’s hate, and so tired that 
we didn’t sense the danger from 
another direction in the form of a 
flanking movement. The operation 
was the end for us. They all had 
drawn weapons, but when they saw 
our sad state they rather sheepishly 
put them away and took us almost 
gently in hand. 

We’re getting weaker. Uncon- 
sciousness is near again. Would that 
we could have stayed with them! 

Instead, one picked up a walkie- 
talkie and called in our capture. 
Even in the turmoil of the moment 


we could pick up flashes of amazed, 
frightened and curious thoughts as 
many of them saw us for the first 
time. Funny how the mind will act 
at times of stress, making one an 
observer of one’s own actions, so to 
speak. Another phase opened for 
study! 

Thurlow thanked the state men 
brusquely and said he and his 
deputies would take over, airily 
ignoring extradition procedure. The 
police chief and our sheriff were 
dubious about the course events 
were taking, but didn’t want trou- 
ble so they offered no active re- 
sistance. 

We were too tired to care any 
more. That was our third mistake, 
to lose our alertness completely. 
Had we been quick enough — but 
no, we couldn’t have avoided it. 
The old story of trained men re- 
acting without conscious thought. 

Apparently in accordance with 
previous instruction, Trainor and 
his helper began jostling us vicious- 
ly but expertly, making it appear 
as though we were trying to escape. 
Before we realized our danger, we 
heard a cry of warning from the 
sheriff and a vindictive shout from 
Thurlow. It still rings in our ears. 

“Do your duty, Trainor. They’re 
escaping!” 

Trainor’s reflexes jarred him into 
action and it was over for us almost 
before it began. It hurt then, but 
the pain is worse now and total 
blackness is closing in once more. 
Fighting it off gets increasingly dif- 
ficult, alone as I am. 

You see, Donald has just died, 
quietly. He’s escaped them, but 
that leaves the fight to me. It won’t

last long. The load is too much for 
one alone. The one bright feature 
is the fact that our work was be- 
gun. Stay with it, darling, and car- 
ry on for us — please know that you 
had all our love. 

Goodbye, Princess. 

Almost exactly one minute later 
they arrived at the hospital . I was 
so numb with grief and sorrow that 
1 didn’t withdraw contact, hoping 
against hope that they , he, would 


transmit once more . He did, un- 
consciously . Seconds later the words 
of two interns drifted through his 
open mind to mine . 

“One D. O. A., one dying fast. 
My God, Rex, why couldn’t they 
leave the poor devils alone? Why 
couldn’t they — ” 

Rex sounded bitter. “You know 
the answer to that, Tom. They 
were different so they didn’t be- 
long.” • • •

THE PACIFISTS 


BY CHARLES E. FRITCH 

Parker was a trouble maker wherever they 
landed . But here was the planet ideal, a 
chance he had awaited a long , long time 
— easy, like taking candy from a baby . 


L IKE A lone sentinel, the house 
i stood apart at the edge of the 
village, a white cube with no win- 
dows. The door stood open, a dark 
hole against the white brick. The 
house was silent. The village beyond 
was silent. 

“They must have seen us land,” 
Compton said, a little wildly. “You 
can’t set down a rocket ship a hun- 
dred yards from somebody and not 
have them notice. They must have 
seen us!” 

“Unless no one lives here,” Par- 
ker amended. “This may be a ghost 
city.” 


“He’s right,” Hinckley agreed. 
“There might not be anyone living 
here, or anyplace on the planet for 
that matter. We’ve found very little 
life in these alien star-systems, and 
it’s varied from primitive to an- 
cient. Perhaps this society became 
old and died before any of us were 
bom.” 

The three Earthmen stood at the 
base of the spaceship, their space- 
suit headpieces thrown back so they 
could breathe in the cool thin air. 
They stood there peering into the 
deathly stillness. 

“I hope there are people living 


75 



here/’ Parker said. “It’s been more 
than a month now — ” 

“Well,” Hinckley said, “let’s find 
out.” He waved them forward. 

They were fifty feet from the 
house when a woman appeared in 
the doorway with a silver vase. She 
was dressed in a grey flowing robe 
that covered her from neck to an- 
kles. 

“A young woman,” Hinckley 
breathed, staring. “A woman just 
like any on Earth!” 

His voice was loud in the silence, 
but the woman took no notice. She 
stooped and began filling the vase 
with sand. The two men with 
Hinckley shifted anxiously, settling 
the sand beneath their boots. Be- 
hind them the great spaceship 
pointed its nose at the sky. 

Parker was staring intently at the 
girl. “I’m going to like this place,” 
he said slowly. 

They walked forward, crunch- 
ing sand. But the girl took no 
notice of their approach. She was 
kneeling beside the house, scooping 
tiny handfuls of sand into the silver 
vase. When they were within five 
feet of her, Hinckley cleared his 
throat. She did not look up. He 
coughed. 

“Maybe she’s deaf,” Parker sug- 
gested vaguely. His eyes wandered 
appraisingly over her youthful 
body; he licked dry lips. 

Hinckley moved forward and 
stood before the girl. Her small 
white hands dug into the sand, 
scooping around his boots as though 
not aware of them. 

“And blind, too?” Compton 
wanted to know. “And without the 
sense of touch?” There was a 


strange quality to his voice, as 
though some primitive part of his 
unconsciousness was telling him to 
run. 

Hinckley bent to tap the girl 
lightly upon the shoulder. “Pardon 
me. Miss. We’re visitors from 
Earth,” he told her. 

But she paid no attention to the 
sound of his voice, and he stepped 
back, puzzled. 

“Now what?” Compton wanted 
to know. He looked around him 
nervously, at the house, the 
speckled sand, the rocket squatting 
behind them. “I hope all the na- 
tives aren’t like this.” 

“I do,” Parker said, licking his 
lips thoughtfully and keeping his 
gaze on the girl. “I’d just as soon 
have them all like this. It might be 
interesting.” 

Compton flushed. “What I 
meant — ” 

“He knows what you meant,” 
Hinckley said harshly. “And there 
won’t be any of that going on here. 
You caused enough trouble on the 
other planets, and it’s not going to 
happen again, not while I’m in 
charge of this expedition. We didn’t 
come all the way out here just so 
you could satisfy your romantic in- 
clinations.” 

“And how about my off hours, 
Captain ” Parker said, emphasizing 
the word as though it were obscene ; 
“then may I fraternize?” 

“You have no off hours,” Hinck- 
ley said sternly. 

“Here comes another one,” 
Compton warned in a whisper. 

A man, dressed in robes similar 
to the woman’s, came from the 
door of the house and walked into 


76 


CHARLES E. FRITCH 



the yard. After helping the wom- 
an to rise, he picked up the vase, 
and the two of them went back 
inside the house. He hadn’t even 
looked at the Earthmen. 

After awhile, Parker said, “Do 
you suppose they’re both mirages?” 

“Maybe that’s it,” Compton said. 
“Maybe it’s all a mirage, the wom- 
an, the vase, the man, the house, 
maybe even the planet itself.” His 
voice had risen in his excitement. 

“Take it easy,” Hinckley advised. 

“Let’s get back to the ship before 
the whole planet evaporates,” 
Compton said. 

“Go back if you like,” Hinckley 
said. “I’m going to investigate this. 
How about you, Parker?” 

“Okay with me. Always wanted 
to see what makes a mirage tick.” 
He glanced contemptuously at 
Compton. 

“Okay,” Compton said, gripping 
his rifle, “we’ll all make fools of 
ourselves.” 

“C’mon, then.” 

Hinckley led the way into the 
house, hesitating only briefly at the 
doorway. Inside, a blue light flick- 
ered as the man bent over a flaming 
trough and poured sand into it 
from the silver vase. The flames 
leaped high, filling the room with 
a sweet fragrance. The man emp- 
tied the vase, rose and took it to one 
corner of the room. He sat down on 
the couch by the woman. He did 
not look at the Earthlings. 

“He doesn’t see us either,” 
Compton said hoarsely. He cried, 
“Hey, you! You! Listen! We’re 
Earthmen. Visitors from space.” 

His voice was explosive in the 
silence. The man didn’t look up. 

THE PACIFISTS 


The Earthmen became aware of 
music seeping from the walls, mu- 
sic strange and hauntingly beauti- 
ful, played on incredible invisible 
instruments. 

“I don’t like this,” Compton said. 
“I don’t like it at all. Why are they 
ignoring us? Why?” 

“Maybe they can’t help it,” 
Hinckley suggested. “Perhaps they 
actually can’t see us or hear us. It’s 
fantastic, but it’s possible.” 

“I wonder,” Parker mused. And 
before anyone could stop him, he 
struck the man across the face with 
a doubled fist. 

“Parker!” Hinckley cried. “You 
fool!” 

“That’s a matter of opinion,” 
Parker said steadily, rubbing his 
knuckles. “I found out what I 
wanted to.” 

The man had fallen beneath 
the blow, but recovered seconds 
later. There was a large red welt 
on his forehead, but neither he nor 
the woman took any notice of it. 

“It’s incredible,” Compton said. 

“Evidently we can affect them 
physically, even if not mentally,” 
Hinckley said. “You do something 
like that again, Parker, and I’ll 
shoot you. I’ve got the authority 
to do it, you know, and sometimes 
the urge.” 

“I know,” Parker said, “but you 
haven’t got the guts. Besides, I’ll 
behave myself.” He looked intently 
at the young woman. “I just wanted 
to make certain they’re real, that’s 
all.” 

“Let’s get out of here,” Compton 
suggested. “There must be some 
way we can get a message through 
to these people. Perhaps someone in 

77 



the village — ” 

Hinckley nodded and motioned 
them from the house. Compton 
went eagerly, but Parker lingered. 
The air outside seemed cooler now, 
and its freshness seemed strange 
after the pleasant fragrance inside 
the house. 

“Go back to the ship,” Hinckley 
told Parker. “Compton and I’ll 
go into the village.” 

“I like it right here,” Parker 
said. 

“We might need someone at the 
ship,” Hinckley said. “That’s an 
order.” His hand caressed his rifle, 
as though daring Parker to refuse. 

Parker grinned contemptuously. 
“Anything you say, Captain . If you 
need any help, just yell.” He turned 
away and walked toward the rock- 
et. 

“Someday I’m going to kill him,” 
Hinckley promised. He turned to 
Compton. “G’mon, let’s see what 
the village looks like.” 

T HE VILLAGE was a replica of 
the first hut, multiplied. Some 
of the huts seemed to have special- 
ized purposes as stores or ware- 
houses, but otherwise it was the 
same. People sat in the houses, 
listening to music or watching 
moving pictures swarm over their 
hut walls. Some occasionally ven- 
tured into the street. All of them 
ignored the Earthmen. 

“I don’t know what to make of 
it,” Hinckley said finally. “We can 
touch them and hear them; they 
appear normal in all respects, but 
they seem to be operating on a 
different level of existence.” 


“I don’t pretend to understand 
it,” Compton said, “but I have a 
feeling I don’t like, whenever I 
think about it. I’d rather meet bug- 
eyed monsters than this.” 

“I know what you mean,” Hinck- 
ley said. “These people even though 
they’re humanoid, are out of con- 
tact with reality — at least with 
reality as we know it. It’s like some 
kind of mass hypnosis, with every- 
one in a trance except us.” 

“Think of how helpless these 
people would be,” Compton said. 
“When we turn in our report, those 
who come out here with unhealthy 
designs won’t have any opposition.” 

“We have a prime example of 
that on board,” Hinckley said dis- 
gustedly. “We’d better get back to 
the ship; I don’t like to leave Parker 
alone; there’s no telling what he’ll 
do.” 

When they got back Parker 
wasn’t there. 

“I was afraid of this,” Hirickley 
said between clenched teeth. 

“Maybe they’ve done something 
to him,” Compton suggested nerv- 
ously. 

“That’s too much to hope for. 
Chances are, it’s the other way 
around. If I know Parker, there’s 
only one place he’ll be. C’mon.” 

Clutching his rifle, Hinckley ran 
from the rocket. Compton followed, 
a bit more cautiously. 

Hinckley reached the lone house 
and peered into the bluelit gloom. 
He entered, gun ready, Compton at 
his heels. 

“He’s not here,” Hinckley said, 
surprised. 

The man and the young woman 
sat on the couch and casually 

CHARLES E. FRITCH 


78 



watched pictures move across the 
far wall. Hinckley, looking at the 
pictures, was not at all certain they 
weren’t the reality and the natives 
of this place merely ghost images 
that might fade at any moment. 

On the wall an empire was being 
formed. Tall buildings were raised 
by machinery that was unfamiliar 
to the Earthmen. Aircraft flitted 
across the sky like strange black 
birds. The buildings towered, the 
flying machines dove, spitting need- 
les that exploded into blossoms of 
fire, and the buildings toppled into 
dust. People ran, screaming sound- 
less screams. Columns of smoke rose 
to replace the buildings. The scene 
shifted. Great weapons were as- 
sembled and heaped carelessly. To 
the heap were added the skycraft 
and other weapons of war. The 
pile exploded, and the people re- 
joiced, clasping hands, dancing. 
The walls darkened. 

Actual or symbolic? Hinckley 
wondered. 

“What does it mean?” Compton 
asked him. 

“I think,” Hinckley said, “we’ve 
just been given a short history of 
their race. They built up a great 
society here, but a warring one. 
Finally, they outlawed all weapons 
in order to save themselves from 
total destruction. We could prob- 
ably take a lesson from that.” 

“They’ll probably be worse off 
when the Earthmen come here,” 
Compton said. “Even if they could 
see and hear us, they wouldn’t have 
any weapons left to defend them- 
selves. We could loot and rape 
and — ” 

“I think we’d better forget this 
THE PACIFISTS 


planet exists,” Hinckley said slow- 
ly. “If we don’t report it, no one’ll 
ever know. It’s one planet in a mil- 
lion planets. If we say it’s empty, 
they’ll believe it and never bother 
to check.” 

“But what about Parker?” 

“Yes,” Hinckley said in a dis- 
turbed tone. “Parker. We’ve got to 
find him before he does anything 
he shouldn’t. He must be in one 
of the huts. C’mon. You take one 
side of the village, I’ll take the 
other. When we find him, we’ll 
blast off.” 

But they didn’t find him. They 
searched through all the buildings, 
peered into all the faces. 

“I don’t like it,” Compton said 
when they met. “The people may 
be helpless, but that doesn’t mean 
everything on the planet is. We’ve 
got to get out of here while we’ve 
got the chance.” 

“Take it easy,” Hinckley advised. 
“We can’t leave without Parker. 
He’s probably hiding someplace.” 

“Hiding?” 

“Hoping we’ll take off and leave 
him alone here. He’d be perfectly 
safe. He could take anything he 
wanted — food, drink, anything — 
and these people couldn’t raise a 
finger to stop him; they wouldn’t 
even know he was here, most likely. 
If I know Parker that’s what he’d 
want. He wouldn’t care about the 
people as long as he satisfied him- 
self.” 

“We’ll never find him,” Comp- 
ton said. “There’s a forest beyond 
the village. If he got into that, we 
could search for months and not 
find him.” 

Hinckley shrugged. “We’ve got 

79 



to try.” 

Night came before they returned 
to the rocket. 

Hinckley shook his head in the 
gathering darkness. “He could be 
anyplace out there, damn him.” 

“Let’s get out of here,” Comp- 
ton suggested again. “Leave him 
here, if that’s what he wants. Let 
him do what he wants here; what 
difference does it make if the 
natives don’t know what’s happen- 
ing?” 

Hinckley’s look was cold. “We’ll 
wait until morning,” he said. “If 
he isn’t back by then, we’ll leave.” 

But the next morning, the rays 
of the alien sun found the white 
squatting houses silent; Parker had 
not returned. 

Hinckley turned on the outer 
loudspeaker. “Parker,” he said. The 
words crashed across the still vil- 
lage. “Parker, this is Hinckley. 
We’re blasting off in five minutes. 
If you’re not aboard, we’re leaving 
without you.” 

After a few minutes, Compton 
said, “He’s not coming. He’s prob- 
ably dead, and so will we be if we 
wait long enough.” 

“More likely, he’s ignoring us,” 
Hinckley said, consulting his watch. 
“He’s got two minutes more.” 

Two minutes later, Compton 
said, “Time’s up.” 

Hinckley nodded. He switched 
on the rocket motors. Deep within 
the spaceship a turbine growled; 
the growl rose to a whine. 

“I still don’t like to leave him 
there. Even though they don’t 
know what’s happening to them, I 
feel sorry for those people out 
there.” He switched on the loud- 

80 


speaker again. “Parker,” he said 
over it. “Last chance. We’re blast- 
ing off.” 

“He’s not coming,” Compton 
said shrilly, “he’s not coming.” 

Hinckley touched a button. 
Flaming rockets drove their fire 
in to the ground. The great space- 
ship shuddered, rose on a column 
of flame. 

“At last,” Compton sighed. “At 
last.” 

“We’ll have to come back, 
though,” Hinckley said. “I knew 
we’d have to turn in a report, and 
now I know we’ll have to come 
back here to find Parker, to jail him 
as a deserter, and perhaps worse. I 
hate to think of what’ll happen to 
those people down there when the 
Earthmen come.” 

They looked into a viewscreen. 
Below them, the planet dwindled 
and became nothing. 

F ROM the edge of the forest, 
Parker watched the spaceship 
rise into the sky and disappear. He 
chuckled contentedly. He had won 
the game of hide-and-seek, and the 
planet was his prize. Earthmen al- 
ways took what they could from 
newly discovered planets, only this 
time he would have first choice well 
ahead of any others. It would be 
months before an Earth ship would 
arrive. But he could last that long 
easily. Longer if necessary. During 
that time he could make up some 
story to account for his absence. 
They’d have to prove him a liar, 
and that would be difficult. Any 
story he made up would certainly 
be no less fantastic than this planet 

CHARLES E. FRITCH 



certainly was. 

Meanwhile, there were things to 
do. 

He took off his cumbersome 
spacesuit and left it in a clearing 
in the forest; he wouldn’t need that 
for awhile, and it would only ham- 
per him. He was in no mood to be 
delayed. There were a great many 
things to do, but first there was one 
special thing to do. There was a 
girl, he remembered, a young wom- 
an in a small hut at the other end 
of the village. He licked his lips in 
anticipation. There was a man with 
her, but there was nothing he could 
do — nothing at all. Parker laughed 
loudly into the silence and trotted 
down the street. 

When he reached the 1 other end 
of the village, he walked eagerly 
into the house. The girl sat on the 
couch. The man stood nearby. The 
walls were unmoving and the blue 
fire cast a cold light about the 
room. The Earthman sat down be- 
side the girl, and his hands reached 
out, unhesitating. 

But suddenly the man said some- 
thing in an alien tongue, a sound 
that was like a whiplash, angry and 
bitter. 

Parker felt his throat tighten. 
“What?” he said. “What?” 

He looked up into eyes alive with 
hate. No, that was impossible. It 
was only imagination. Only im- 
agination, yet for a moment — he 
laughed guiltily — he’d thought the 
man was looking directly at him. 

Furiously, angry at himself, Par- 
ker forced the thought from his 
mind. He reached once more for 
the girl, but she shrank from his 
touch and leaped up. The Earth- 

THE PACIFISTS 


man followed her movement with 
startled, puzzled eyes, and then his 
bewilderment changed to a fear 
that held him with cold fingers. 

The man had taken a long silver 
knife from beneath his robe, and 
he held it in his hands so that its 
blade reflected the cold blue fire. 
His face was a mask, not pleasant 
to see. And he was looking at the 
Earthman, seeing him, watching 
him, hating him. 

A sudden flash of understanding 
came. These people had known all 
the time. They stayed indoors in 
dim light to enhance the illusion 
and watch with greater secrecy, so 
that the movement of eyes would 
not betray them — and they had 
waited. For what? 

Parker leaped up with a hoarse 
cry and ran, not waiting to find 
out. He was in the doorway when 
the silver knife caught him and 
slid easily between his ribs and re- 
leased the breath of life that lay 
hidden there. Before he struck the 
ground, he was a shell, with neither 
fear nor desire to trouble him. 

For a long moment afterward, 
the man stood over the still body, 
looking down at it with a mixture 
of hate and disgust. The girl joined 
him. He looked at her and then at 
the sky. 

“We must learn to make weapons 
again,” he told her. “These crea- 
tures will be back, unsuspecting, 
thinking us helpless. Next time, we 
must be ready!” 

Without ceremony, they buried 
the Earthman’s body and then met 
others of their kind coming into the 
village streets. There was work to 
do. • • •

The 

Laboratorians 

BY EDWARD PEATTIE 


Y EAH, we drop in just three c.c. from this here 
tube,” said Rocco as he expertly twirled the 
erlenmeyer flask and watched the color shoot past 
the methyl orange end-point. Whitemarsh was an- 
noyed and said so. 

“That’s the sixth straight you’ve missed, and the 
acid comes out of the burette, not the tube; and 
you don’t call the graduations c.c., you call them 
milliliters.” 

“Yeah? Well, here we call it a tube!” 

“And why don’t you go down to the end-point 
drop by drop?” 

“Because the book don’t say so! That’s why! You 
technos make me sick. Here we do all the blasted 


82 




work, and you try to tell us how 
to do what we’ve been doing for 
ten years!” 

Rocco was beginning to work 
himself into one of his famous 
rages. His bull neck was beginning 
to redden; his eyes started to flash. 
His entire squat body started to 
quiver. 

Whitemarsh wasn’t impressed. 
Over at the atomic plant, Phobus’s 
Quercus Mountain, he had bossed 
a pretty quarrelsome crew of iso- 
tope wranglers. He had never 
dodged a fight in his life. But this 
was in a chemical laboratory and 
it surprised him to hear the as- 


lllustrated by Ed Emsh 

sistants talk back. 

The only assistants he had ever 
known were clear-eyed youths tak- 
ing a year away from their studies 
to recoup their tuition money and 
who tried to copy everything the 
chemists did. But Whitemarsh was 
new to the Interspatial Research 
Center on the Moon, and he still 
could not figure why the assistants 
acted as they did. So he waited. 

Rocco banged the flask down on 
the stone bench, glared at White- 
marsh for an instant, and then 
rushed out of the Laboratory, mut- 
tering a few obscenities. 

“Queer place this,” mused 


83 


Whitemarsh, filling up another flask 
and finishing the titration himself. 
“Here the helpers tell the chemists 
what to do and get mad if we ask 
them what they’re doing.” 

He started to look over Rocco’s 
notes and ruefully decided all the 
work would have to be done over 
again. He was interrupted when a 
girl opened the door. In the week 
he had been stationed at IRC, he 
had been introduced to so many 
scientists that he had forgotten 
most of the names, but he remem- 
bered all the girls. His former 
Atomic Plant at Quercus Mountain 
had had all too few for him not to 
appreciate them now. Miss Sally 
Chester was a statuesque chemist 
with long blonde hair and a lus- 
cious figure which she hid under a 
white lab robe. He managed to 
stammer some sort of greeting. 

“Why Dr. Whitemarsh!” She 
seemed somewhat puzzled. “You’re 
not actually working with your 
hands?” 

“I sure am, unless we’re both 
space struck. Why not?” 

“Well, I suppose it’s all right 
other places, here we let the 
Laboratorians do all the manual 
work. It’s sort of their privilege.” 

“Yes, but their technique’s lousy. 
I sat here this afternon and watched 
that blow-hard Rocco muff six 
straight end-points in a row and 
when I asked him how come, he 
blew his top!” 

She laughed at that. She sat 
down on the lab desk and said, 
“You’re absolutely right. Antonio 
Rocco’s color blind and always 
misses his Methyl Orange end- 
points. And he’s been doing them 


for ten years. But it hurts his feel- 
ings to be criticized, you should 
have been more diplomatic. He’s 
probably gone to complain to his 
boss!” 

“His boss? Aren’t we his bosses? 
On this sheet he’s listed as my as- 
sistant.” 

“Actually yes. But traditionally 
the shop foreman is the leader of 
the Laboratorians. He certifies them 
to see that they know their work, 
signs their time cards and tells them 
when to take time off. Of course 
we outline the work they do, check 
their results and write reports from 
their data. Normally we come into 
the lab as little as possible.” 

“But Sally, how the hell do we 
know that their results are right? 
This mixed-up outfit is in the hands 
of a bunch of left-handed prfma 
donnas who don’t know Beilstein 
from Budweiser!” 

She smiled again (and he 
thought of the ads for Stargleam 
toothpaste). “Let’s go over to the 
Scientists’ Snack Bar and get a cup 
of coffee, and I’ll tell you a little 
about the history of this labora- 
tory.” 

So he let her lead him out of the 
individual laboratory into the pastel 
blue corridor where they followed 
the spiral runways to the glass en- 
closed Snack Bar. 

Here they sat on pale leather 
chairs and looked out over the ex- 
panse of the Central Laboratory. 
From where he sat, he could see 
a square mile of magnificent equip- 
ment: Serpentine condensers, enor- 
mous distillation columns, mole- 
cular stills, ultra-centrifuges, elec- 
tron microscopes, all were spread 


84 


EDWARD PEATTIE 



out before him. Surrounding the 
central laboratory were the innu- 
merable railings of the corridors 
leading to the individual offices. 
Upstairs and downstairs strolled 
scientists and Laboratorians respec- 
tively, all obviously contented. He 
turned to face Miss Chester who 
was lolling in the chair beside him. 
She had poured him a cup of 
coffee, given him a plate of rolls 
and was ready to talk. 

She reminded him that in 2005 
it was found necessary to build 
research laboratories on the Moon 
to avoid the guided meteorites 
which the Aliens had been hurling 
toward the Earth. Since there had 
also been a shortage of trained 
scientists, it was necessary to train 
apprentices to operate the compli- 
cated laboratory equipment ... to 
perform the operations without 
bothering themselves with the 
theory. The Laboratorians were 
needed and they did a good job 
running specification tests on all the 
equipment necessary for the inter- 
planetary war. After the war, the 
Interspatial Corporation had made 
it the Central Research Laboratory, 
since this had been the largest ag- 
gregation of instruments ever 
gathered together, and in the ten 
intervening years, the numbers of 
college-trained scientists had in- 
creased almost ten-fold. As long as 
the Laboratorians confined their 
work to the equipment they were 
familiar with, they were unbeat- 
able. To guide them they had the 
Book, as the Technical Manual of 
the Interspatial Corporation was 
known, and the Laboratorians fol- 
lowed its procedures to the letter. 

THE LABORATORIANS 


“But they don’t know why 
they’re doing things,” Whitemarsh 
interrupted. “The manual’s been 
in need of revision for the last five 
years, and research workers don’t 
use the same tests all the time!” 

“Well that’s right,” admitted 
Sally without disagreement. “I 
usually have my particular labora- 
tory instructions mimeotyped and 
bound in a little book. I’ve also got 
the instructions so fixed that if they 
do things wrong, I can catch them. 
And I’ve learned not to modify my 
instructions orally. That only con- 
fuses the men and results in chaos. 
With a little planning, you can get 
good work done, and if you don’t 
mind humoring their whims a little, 
there’s no reason why you can’t get 
along with them.” 

Whitemarsh wasn’t so sure. He 
had no objections to jollying his 
subordinates, but he did draw the 
line at sloppy lab technique. He 
escorted Miss Chester to her own 
office, thanked her for the briefing, 
and then started to worry on his 
own. He took the speed elevator up 
to Dr. Sheridan’s office. 

The Laboratory director was 
sympathetic. He looked at the 
broad-shouldered young giant, Dr. 
Whitemarsh, and reflected that this 
man was rated the most promising 
scientist the Interspatial Corpora- 
tion ever had. 

“You’re damn right, White- 
marsh,” he told the younger man, 
pushing him into a chair and of- 
fering him a cigarette. “I’ve been 
here three years and spent the first 
two fighting the system. Maybe the 
trouble goes back to our Board of 
Directors. They’re all so proud of 

85 



this shining Research Station on the 
Moon, that they hate to admit that 
anything’s wrong. They’ve got the 
Laboratorians responsible to the 
Lunar Mines Service — and there it 
stands. 

“So the only thing we can do is 
wait. Lo Presti the Master Me- 
chanic is up for retirement next 
year and there’s going to be a big 
organizational shake-up. Hold 
tight. After that we may have a 
free hand.” 

So Whitemarsh thanked him and 
bided his time. He released Rocco 
back to some other scientist and did 
his own laboratory work, even 
though the Laboratorian Council 
made a written protest. He also 
spent many hours in the excellent 
laboratory library, reading all the 
reports coming out of the Lunar 
Laboratory over the past ten years. 

His discoveries amazed him. 
Theoretically the Lunar Lab had 
one of the best collections of scien- 
tific minds in the Solar System. 
Every Earth university was rep- 
resented on its staff. New tech- 
niques and products had poured out 
of the Laboratory during the ten 
years of its existence, yet every one 
of these had been based on doubt- 
ful data. Certain things worried 
him. First, notes were kept in a 
very cavalier manner even by the 
most experienced scientists. Sec- 
ondly, the younger chemists and 
physicists never had been exposed 
to any practical laboratory work 
after their student days, and conse- 
quently had no means of judging 
the technique of their assistants. 
Finally, the Laboratorians were ap- 
parently proud of their ignorance, 


displayed a contempt for “paper 
work” and were only too willing to 
fix their results if they thought they 
could get away with it . 

He did not let his social develop- 
ment slide either. Lunarport was far 
more advanced culturally than the 
crude settlement on Phobus. Here 
Dr. Whitemarsh was able to have 
a luxurious apartment in the New 
Dome sector, could hear lectures 
and concerts, and could even in- 
dulge in winter sports such as ski- 
ing in the lava around the craters 
(protected of course by a heated 
suit and an oxygen mask.) He 
found Miss Chester a satisfactory 
companion for such endeavors, even 
though she spoke little of her pri- 
vate life or how she had avoided 
marriage in her twenty-five years. 
But he played a waiting game with 
her as well as with the lab job. He 
admitted to himself that a research 
chemist’s life at Lunar Lab was a 
pleasant one, particularly if one 
didn’t care how accurate one’s re- 
sults were. Unfortunately, the same 
quirk which had driven him into 
science also made him suspicious 
of all easy methods. He had never 
recovered from the shock of dis- 
covering that just because a reac- 
tion worked in a book, it did not 
necessarily have to do so in a 
laboratory. 

D R. WHITEMARSH’S promo- 
tion came within five rather 
than six months. There was some 
grumbling among the older scien- 
tists, but there was not much they 
could do about it. Kercheval, who 
had twelve years’ service on the 


86 EDWARD PEATTIE 



Moon, did not have his Ph.D and 
did not care particularly for ex- 
ecutive work. Neither did Sturte- 
vant with a doctorate and ten years 
service. But others objected; even 
Miss Chester, long one of White- 
marsh’s defenders, felt that the 
older men deserved at least the 
chance of refusal. (It never oc- 
curred to Whitemarsh that she 
might have had some ambitions of 
her own.) 

He called the group leaders to- 
gether for a conference the day 
after his appointment. He was now 
ensconced behind Sheridan’s desk 
and was not yet accustomed to 
having a secretary. The leaders 
came in grim and resentful. He 
wasted no words. 

“I’m going to reorganize the set- 
up to get the Laboratorians under 
us, whether they like it or not. 
This sloppy technical data and un- 
substantiated findings is not my idea 
of a good lab — nor yours, I’m sure. 
It’s up to you to show it during the 
next year. Meanwhile you’ve all 
been pushed up fifty dollars a 
month in salary. So long!” 

His next step was to call on Lo 
Presti. The Master Mechanic’s Of- 
fice was outside the Lab Dome near 
the Shaft of Lunar Mine No. 1. 
The old man had been in the pre- 
liminary Selenium exploration par- 
ty and never could forget the old 
days when he drove the men and 
robots to find the metal that paid 
for the cost of the Expedition. The 
President of the Home Office, Dr. 
Barker, had never forgotten either, 
and Lo Presti was always taken 
care of. The 200 Laboratorians 
probably caused him more head- 

THE LABORATORIANS 


aches than the five thousand 
miners ever had, since a delegation 
visited him every day or so now 
that Dr. Whitemarsh was rumored 
in. 

But the Lo Presti knew that times 
change too, and realized that the 
brawling space adventurer did not 
fit into a sleek world of test tubes 
and retorts. Ninety-five years old 
and arrogant as ever, he sat in his 
office and greeted Dr. Whitemarsh 
with a bonecrushing handshake. He 
offered a cigar and Whitemarsh 
thanked him, lighting a pipe in- 
stead. 

“I hear from the boys you’ve been 
cracking down on them,” he stated. 

“No more than you would if 
you’d been there yourself. What 
would you do if a driller split a 
core?” 

“Why I’d give the careless sap a 
clout that would wake him up. 
But the Laboratorians aren’t drill- 
ers!” 

“That’s right, but that’s the way 
some of them are muffing their 
work.” 

Lo Presti eyed him appraisingly. 
“Aren’t you the same Whitemarsh 
who capped the crater on Phobus 
last year?” 

“I sure am. And your Labora- 
torians are a bevy of Nice Nellies 
compared to that mutinous bunch 
of space rats I had with me.” 

“Well, maybe you’re the man 
for the job at that. The guys don’t 
put out anymore. Used to be I 
knew all the gang. I’d look around 
and see when they were goofing 
off. Now they’re all such experts, 
I can’t tell if they’re loafing or just 
thinking.” They both laughed at 

87 



that. Whitemarsh thought it would 
be a good time to say: “I don’t 
want to do anything to your boys 
for a while until I get my own 
gang straightened out!” 

“Don’t kid me, Doc,” responded 
Lo Presti, “you know when I re- 
tire you’re going to move in and 
crack down. Well I’m with you!” 

So they parted friends. 

Whitemarsh went back to his 
office in a happy mood. True, Miss 
Chester had been avoiding him 
lately and he had to drink coffee 
by himself but he now had and the 
foremen on his side and the front 
office. Now was the chance to re- 
form the laboratory. 

His first bombshell was the re- 
quirement that all the junior chem- 
ists should take a qualifying ex- 
amination. That really caused trou- 
ble in paradise. Apparently, all of 
the younger set had thrown away 
their books on graduation and re- 
membered only their own special- 
ties. Whitemarsh, from being a 
pleasant companion at the Snack 
Bar who discussed skiing and space- 
ball, had now become an ogre of 
the first water. The senior chemists 
chuckled, since they were exempt, 
and the Laboratorians guffawed 
aloud to see their harriers in turn 
harried. In any event there was 
frenzied activity in the month be- 
fore the examination and the 
library staff did yeoman duty. And, 
no one had threatened to quit. At 
least almost no one. Whitemarsh 
was musingly staring out of his 
office’s Plastoid window at the 
green eye of Earth when he heard 
a commotion outside in the ante- 
room. He looked out to see Sally 

88 


Chester, and he sensed that their 
relationship was less than idyllic. 

“Let me see that egotistical ass, 
Whitemarsh,” she shouted at his 
secretary who cowered in silk clad 
finery as the white-coated Valkyrie 
charged by. 

“Be calm,” he advised her, plac- 
ing himself strategically behind his 
desk. 

“Calm,” she screamed, “how can 
I be calm when an officious busy- 
body starts getting drunk with pow- 
er and acting like a Twentieth Cen- 
tury dictator? After all I’ve done 
for this stinking Lunar Lab, how 
come that I have to take an exam 
in freshman chemistry?” 

“I thought you were exempt,” 
began the chastened director. 

“Sorry, your honor! Your order 
says five years at Lunarport. I’ve 
only been around this sweat shop 
for four years and six months. What 
are you going to do if I fail? Throw 
me out and I’m moving over to 
Campo Sano with every one of our 
trade secrets!” 

“I’ll get you exempted,” he of- 
fered. 

“What, and have the other chem- 
ists cry favoritism? Not on your life, 
you coffee-swilling Judas,” she 
yelled. “And stop grinning at me 
like a Cheshire Cat!” 

He did not answer. He was con- 
tent only to admire her in her rage. 
Her usually mild face was flushed 
through the tan and her graceful 
hands were tightly clenched into 
fists that pounded on his desk. 

“Answer me, you moron!” she 
shouted. Then she started to cry. 
Within one minute the seething 
Amazon had changed into a de- 

EDWARD PEATTIE 



fenseless white-coated girl cowering 
in the visitor’s chair, weeping bit- 
terly. Whitemarsh approached and 
held her hand. 

“Listen, Sally,” he told her, “the 
only reason I was going to let you 
out of the test was because you 
know more chemistry than any of 
the scientists here. But go ahead 
and take the test; you’ll get the 
highest grade!” 

She brightened, “You think so?” 

“Know it,” he affirmed gallantly, 
“now, how about going to the Space 
Opera at the Symphorium tomor- 
row? Kluchesky is singing in 
Pomme de Terre ” 

She stiffened slightly and stood 
up. “Listen, Mr. Frank White- 
marsh! Privately you’re not a bad 
guy. You even had potentialities. 
But you’re a hell of a failure as a 
boss and the less I see of you, the 
happier I’ll be. Good-bye!” And 
she was gone. Whitemarsh resumed 
his contemplation of the Earth with 
less interest. 


T HE RESULTS of the examina- 
tion might have been foretold. 
The intelligent and professionally 
alert junior chemists retained 
enough fundamentals to do well. 
The majority failed the questions 
on laboratory technique. Conse- 
quently Whitemarsh enlisted the 
aid of the older men to conduct a 
series of refresher lectures to bring 
up to date the scientific knowledge 
of those who failed. The Labora- 
torians were delighted with the 
spectacle presented by these lec- 
tures, and loved going home at 
night while erstwhile bosses sat lis- 

THE LABORATORIANS 


tening to Dr. Sturtevant discuss 
“The Theory of Washing Precipi- 
tates”, or to hear Dr. Whitemarsh 
talk on “Balancing the Redox equa- 
tion.” The Laboratorian’s happi- 
ness lasted until one day in Octo- 
ber. 

That was the day that Lo Presti 
retired. The old man was given a 
small space ship by the Corporation 
and a space-time chronometer by 
the Laboratorians. Then he sorrow- 
fully said farewell. The next day 
the Laboratorians were absorbed 
into Research. 

Somebody had to plan for janitor 
service, figure where to place time 
cards, design new proficiency rat- 
ings and decide on such complex 
matters as where the Laboratorians 
were to hang their coats. All these 
services had been provided for by 
the miner’s shop organization. 
Whitemarsh stayed late at night 
for a week arranging the new pay- 
roll plan and raising the salaries 
somewhat. 

All this was handled, if not with- 
out incidents, at least without vio- 
lence. Even the janitors and secre- 
taries were now part of a team. All 
but Miss Chester. She had stopped 
speaking to Whitemarsh in the 
halls and had been seen in the com- 
pany of a younger (and White- 
marsh felt) better looking physicist. 

Then Whitemarsh dropped his 
second bombshell. The junior 
chemists were ordered to rate the 
Laboratorians for proficiency ! 
Fresh from six months’ study under 
such taskmasters as Whitemarsh 
and Kercheval, the chastened scien- 
tists were now able to interpret the 
antics of their tormentors of yes- 

89 



terday. An old tradition had fallen 
and the howls extended back to the 
Front Office on Earth. 

For a change, Miss Chester did 
not object. She was evidently past 
all comment. She merely wrote out 
a list of the faults and virtues of 
all her assistants, rated them all 
Excellent and went back to her 
research. 

But Rocco was tried and found 
incapable of running titrations. 
Harry Crowe was found to be 
weighing incorrectly, Zachary had 
been fixing his calculations for the 
last ten years and even faithful 
Bruno had been found to be add- 
ing 15 to all of his Iodine numbers 
in order to pass the specs easier. 

It suddenly occurred to every 
one that all the laboratory’s reports 
were based on incorrect data. All 
work stopped for a week until the 
scientists found what their assistants 
had been trying to do all along. And 
the results were a bit terrifying. 
When Kercheval found that an in- 
correctly calibrated reflectometer 
had negated five years of his pet 
project, he tore up his notebooks, 
flung them on the floor and stalked 
into Whitemarsh’s office. 

“Frank, I’m taking my back va- 
cations and going to Venus to for- 
get it all for about six months. And 
mind you, when I get back I don’t 
want to see my present assistants. 
I’m going to start from scratch.” 

He left, banging the door. 

Next was Sturtevant. 

“Frank, we’ve got to get Inter- 
stellar Review to hold my last pa- 
per. I want to recheck the melting 
points of some of those diazo com- 
pounds.” 

90 


Then came the young physicist, 
Dr. Slezak, who was rumored to be 
Miss Chester’s present skiing com- 
panion. “Dr. Whitemarsh,” he 
stammered, “I’m not sure about 
the data on my last report.” 

“Didn’t you take it all yourself?” 
“Yes, but I used some of Ker- 
cheval’s data for my fundamental 
calculations and, if that’s wrong, 
all my conclusions may not be 
valid.” 

“Stop worrying,” Whitemarsh 
told him. “When Kercheval recal- 
culates his values, you can revise 
your own report. As long as your 
own work is right, you have nothing 
to worry about.” 

The young man left, nervously 
wringing his hands. Whitemarsh 
couldn’t see what Sally saw in him. 
He figured she ought to be along 
by now. 

She was. 

“I told you so,” Sally said 
theatrically. “You’ve got the whole 
lab mistrusting each other. All the 
chemists are quarreling like mad 
and the Laboratorians all look like 
whipped dogs. You’ve pulled the 
chair right out from under every- 
thing and you sit here gloating.” 
“Relax, Sally,” he told her. 
“They’re just growing pains. Take 
it easy and ride out the storm . 
Now, how about tearing over to 
Lunar 7 to see the crucial Space- 
ball series between the Space 
Rangers and the Callisto Satel- 
lites?” 

She looked horrified. “I’m afraid 
you don’t take hints very well. I’m 
not interested in going anywhere 
with you. Actually, I’m going with 
Jack Slezak to see ‘Nova of the 

EDWARD PEATTIE 



Leprous Soul’, and I might suggest 
a fit subject.” 

She flounced out again and 
Whitemarsh felt lost. He tried to 
cheer himself with a book on Hyper 
Plutonium Elements. 

The transition took longer than 
Whitemarsh had bargained for. 
After the Laboratorians were re- 
educated, and a tiresome process it 
was, chemists went over the note- 
books to look for inaccuracies, 
doubtful data was examined, all 
microfilms had to be edited and 
corrected; and they found that most 
of the chemicals developed at the 
laboratory in the past decade had 
been founded on doubtful data. But 
since all of them had passed the 
Development Group, Whitemarsh 
didn’t think it was wise to try to 
recall them. But new products 
scheduled for release were re-ex- 
amined and retested after the 
fundamental work on them was 
checked. 

Finally the problems were un- 
scrambled and the laboratory began 
to run smoothly again. The research 
projects were reestablished and the 
work started out anew. Frayed 
tempers were soothed and the scien- 
tists finally got around to trusting 
each others’ results again. The 
Laboratorians were now carefully 
but tactfully watched by the junior 
chemists who, in turn, were spend- 
ing more time in the laboratories 
and less in their offices. 

When the new, sound results 
started grinding forth, Whitemarsh 
permitted himself a sigh of relief. 
Lunar Lab had lost its individual- 
ity, he admitted, even though the 
easy-going camaraderie he had no- 

THE LABORATORIANS 


ticed when he first came was also 
gone. The results of Lunar Re- 
search Lab of Interspatial were 
now as reliable as those of the 
Campo Sano and Roque labora- 
tories back on Earth. 

But it had been a hard fight. 
None of the chemists ever stopped 
around his office any more for small 
talk about sports and politics. His 
secretary brought him coffee in his 
sanctum sanctorum and he did not 
find himself wandering around the 
laboratory as he had formerly done. 
When he did, there was usually a 
restrained silence and a suspicious 
neatness. Miss Chester was ap- 
parently irrevocably lost and there 
were rumors of an engagement 
with the brilliant Dr. Slezak. 
Though he had won the day, he 
had lost something too. The Lab 
was now able to turn out results, 
but Frank Whitemarsh had paid a 
personal price for it’s new effi- 
ciency. 

A LMOST a year after taking 
over as Research Director, 
Sheridan, now a Vice President, 
brought him some news. “Get ready 
to pack, Frank,” he told the young- 
er man as they sat and smoked in 
the director’s office watching the 
clouds moving over the Earth. 

“The Front Office like what I 
did?” asked Whitemarsh puffing 
on his pipe. 

“Well.” There was a slight pause. 
“All the scientists on the board 
are behind you to a man. But the 
business men, the advertising boys 
and accountants, well . you know 
how they are.” 

91 



“What’s eating them?” 

“The lab didn’t release any new 
products this past year. Develop- 
ment and even Advertising are 
pretty much slowed down.” 

“That’s right. We’ve got some 
good products about ready, but 
we’re making a final check before 
release. Don’t you think we sent out 
a lot of junk before?” 

“We sure did, even in my time 
though I tried to stop it. But the 
development boys want something, 
anything.” 

“Well?” asked Whitemarsh. 

“So they’d probably rather run 
the risk of getting something bad 
than nothing at all.” 

“They won’t!” 

“That’s right, they never will 
again. Now, I know that the pro- 
ducts you have ready are going to 
be good and I’m not worried about 
them. All we have to do is keep the 
business geniuses out of our hair for 
another six months.” 

“And?” 

“So we’re kicking you upstairs. 
It’s a good job, don’t worry about 
that, at three times your director’s 
salary.” 

“What if I quit?” 

“Don’t be that silly.” 

“What’s the other job?” 

“Works Manager at Quercus 
Mountain on Phobus. Sole boss of 
the biggest Isotope Works in the 
Solar System. You’ll have 50,000 
men under you and have a free 
hand at starting any kind of labora- 
tory you want.” 

“No Laboratorians?” 

“Right. You can start out from 
scratch and make the kind of lab 
you’ve always dreamed of. Here 

92 


we’re thinking of pushing up Ker- 
cheval if it’s all right with you, 
you always rated him highly. It’s 
just like changing Spaceball man- 
agers. We all know the Space Sox 
won the pennant last year on the 
team developed by Kanter even 
though Balhiser was manager. 
These wolves will keep off our tail 
until the new products start com- 
ing through and then we’ll say we 
knew it all along.” 

“You’ve got me half convinced 
not to quit,” said Whitemarsh 
quietly. 

“Now listen Frank,” came back 
Sheridan just as seriously, “you’re 
too good a man to waste. Now take 
your promotion like a nice boy and 
keep in line.” 

“I still think I did a good job 
here.” 

“So do I, but the Board of Di- 
rectors can’t forgive those retrac- 
tions, even though you and I know 
they’re necessary. They don’t know 
what scientific truth and pride are. 
Within ten years, on the founda- 
tions you laid, we’ll have the best 
research record in the country . .” 

After Sheridan had left, White- 
marsh cast a last look at his form- 
er domain. He called Kercheval in 
to give him the news and then tell 
him to keep quiet until verified. 
Then he decided to take a last tour 
around the laboratories. He finally 
found himself up at the Snack Bar 
and his eyes were taking the same 
look over the Laboratory that they 
had done two years before. The 
view looked about the same. He 
had supervised the installation of a 
new Matter Probe over in the front 
center and he was responsible for 

EDWARD PEATTIE 



the Atom Analyzer, but these were 
only minor changes. 

The major change, he thought 
bitterly, is that no one speaks to 
me unless spoken to — I’ve become 
a pariah. Never tamper with the 
status quo, it disturbs too many 
people. It’s a very lonely job. 

There was no one else in the 
Snack Bar. At least, almost no one 
else. He heard a discreet cough be- 
hind him. He turned and found 
Miss Chester seated behind him. 
She had her legs crossed, a cup of 
coffee in one hand and the Space 
News Want-Ads in the other. 

“Hello, Napoleon,” she greeted 
him. “Have you just been surveying 
your empire? Did you see the stem 
men of science jumping through 
the hoops out there? Can you re- 
member the happy place this was 
a year ago when you came? Then 
the Laboratorians took pride in 
their work; now they’re flunkies for 
the green kids fresh from Alma 
Mater!” 

“Stop it, Sally,” he told her. 
“You’re not too far wrong on that 
Napoleon business. I’m taking off 
for my new St. Helena, Quercus 
Mountain on Phobus.” 

“Quercus Mountain? That’s a 
big place. Lab Director?” 

“No. Works Manager.” 
“Heaven help the poor Atomic 
workers!” 

“Don’t be that harsh. Dammit! 
Sally, maybe I am a Napoleon, but 
scientific accuracy is too important 
to play fast and loose with, the way 
they were around here. You know 


it. You’re the only one who didn’t 
relax that vigilance — who saw to it 
that everything you turned out was 
without error. I know now that I 
forgot the human equation — that I 
was so eager for errorless research 
that I trod pretty roughshod over 
a lot of people. But you’re guilty 
too, you know, you had the secret 
— you managed to balance the 
equation when everyone else here 
didn’t. Why didn’t you help me? 
Sure, you came in and ranted and 
raved at me — called me all sorts 
of names, but you didn’t help me, 
you didn’t try to show me the way.” 

tcj » 

“Let me finish,” he interrupted 
her. “I love you, you know — have 
for a long, long, time. I still need 
help, Sally. I don’t want to keep 
playing Napoleon and going into 
exile over and over again. A bigger 
job with more men under me isn’t 
the answer. When a man is lonely 
it makes him hard and cruel in 
circumstances like that. I made all 
of you here relearn scientific facts, 
I need to relearn the humanities 
. .” He paused for a moment. 
“Sally, will you teach me?” 

Her eyes were bright with un- 
shed tears and a catch in her throat 
made the words husky and half- 
whispered. “I wanted to help — I 
love you too — but I thought you 
were arrogant and didn’t need me 
— ” She swallowed, controlling a 
sob. “I’ll make it up to you, darling. 
You won’t be alone again — on 
Phobus or anywhere else in the 
galaxy.” • • •

to gain f where is the enemy? 


THE OUTER QUIET 

BY HERBERT D. KASTLE 


H E LAY on the cot, listening to 
the breathing of the six men 
who shared apartment 2-B with 
him, and the panic fluttered deep 
in his stomach, threatening to break 
upward and out in a wild scream. 
He fought it by telling himself it 
was foolish for a man who had 
lived through the destruction of 
New York and eight months im- 
prisonment to feel this way. 

He peered toward the window 
and tried to see the morning sun; 
not as a pale, shimmery fog but as 
the bright Spring yellow he knew it 
was. But the fog remained, no mat- 


ter how many times he rubbed his 
eyes with saliva-wet fingers. It was 
as if he were seeing everything un- 
der water — a world of shimmery, 
hazy objects. 

The panic rose again. The Con- 
querors’ beam had done its work 
well, and his chances of finding 
Adele before death found him, 
were now terribly small. The first 
punishment had brought only a 
slight blur, this one had almost 
blinded him, and it was only a mat- 
ter of time before he committed the 
third offense. It made no difference 
that Conqueror Punitive assured 


94 




all trainees that the degree of blind- 
ness decreased as the years went by. 
He knew that his third offense 
would come sooner than any im- 
provement in his ability to see. 
And the third offense was punish- 
able by death. 

Before another rush of fear could 
churn his brain, the morning whis- 
tle sounded. Shrill, commanding, 
it began each day of aimless wan- 
dering — the silent stroll over pave- 


ment connecting the five buildings 
of what had once been Brooklyn’s 
prize housing development; a con- 
stant walk which destroyed those 
Americans unable to show com- 
plete obedience and turned the 
others into slaves. 

Again the whistle shrieked, and 
the room filled with coughs, groans 
and sighs, for it was forbidden to 
talk. Only when one of the many 
rules had been broken and a card

bearing the trainee’s number was 
found in the box outside the door 
did some American get a chance 
to speak. He would rush instantly 
to the small administration build- 
ing near the wall’s only exit and re- 
port to the squat, gray-uniformed 
Conqueror known as Punitive — the 
only Conqueror the trainees had 
ever seen. After an explanation of 
the offense in too-precise English, 
the trainee was told to sit on the 
stool facing the light tube. “I obey,” 
he would croak. In silence broken 
only by the hum of electric genera- 
tors in the basement, the beam of 
piercing white light would sear his 
eyes. Afterwards, the assurance 
about the disappearing effects of 
the beam; then back to the streets. 

With only Punitive representing 
them, the Conquerors weeded out 
Americans who would not or could 
not obey. The vaguest suggestion 
of communication between trainees 
was picked up by the detector 
bulbs — the see-and-hear-all devices 
which hung much as oversized light 
bulbs from the ceiling of every 
room, and stood like dead street 
lamps every fifty feet or so along 
the pavements. 

George lay a second longer, then 
twisted his tall, slim body erect and 
sprang to his feet. As he slipped 
into the thick stockings, high- 
topped shoes, and one-piece cover- 
alls with serial number stitched in 
large red numerals across chest and 
back, he began sounding deep in 
his throat. This was so slight a 
touch of the vocal cords that no de- 
tector bulb or other trainee could 
hear it. But it was something more 
than thinking; it was listening to a 

96 


voice repeating all the things that 
had mattered before the Conquer- 
ors’ surprise attack atomized New 
York City. It was his fight against 
non-entity. 

“George Lowery,” he said, “thir- 
ty-two, top salesman at Brady’s 
Men’s Shop, resident of Babylon, 
Long Island, owner of 12 North 
Rector Drive, husband of Adele 
Lowery, and today you may see 
her.” But the last phrase stuck in 
his throat and he had to repeat it 
several times. Even so, he couldn’t 
convince himself that the most im- 
portant part of his ritual was true 
— that perhaps he would see his 
wife as she walked the streets. 

Two days ago he had turned the 
breakfast table to stone by asking 
his neighbor to pass the water. It 
was nothing more than a mistake 
— a stupid thinking aloud. But yes- 
terday the card had been in the 
door-box. He had visited apart- 
ment 1-A in the Administration 
Building and, for the second time, 
the thin beam of light had seared 
his eyes. Now he was no longer 
sure he would be able to recognize 
his own wife. 

“George Lowery,” he sounded, 
fighting off the panic. “George 
Lowery,” and he turned and moved 
through the now-empty rooms. 

He was last in line outside the 
bathroom and waited dully for his 
turn. The men in front of him 
were nothing but tall, short or in- 
between nondescripts. The old 
group, of which he was the last, 
had been different. They had 
looked at each other with meaning, 
with hope. After six months 
passed, and realization came that 

HERBERT D. KASTLE 



no opposition to the Conquerors 
was in sight, they went out in one 
mad day of talk. He had watched 
silently, refusing to respond to the 
suicidal good morning’s, pardon 
me’s, and salty discussions of Con- 
queror Punitive’s parentage. 

Not that life in the project meant 
anything to him. It was just that he 
had to see Adele again — to assure 
himself that she still remembered 
their life together. If her love had 
been stamped out, then the Con- 
querors were right in their men- 
live-by-bread-alone theory, and he 
was only one of a few remaining 
misfits — a breed as expendable in 
the battle for survival as the great, 
pre-historic lizards had been. 

He hadn’t been in the bathroom 
more than five minutes when the 
third whistle sounded. With his 
beard still wet he rushed out of the 
apartment, pausing only to check 
the empty door-box, then ran down 
two flights of stairs to the street. 
It was windy for a morning in 
June and his face felt cold where 
the damp hair covered it. The Con- 
querors allowed nothing that could 
be used as a weapon to fall into 
American hands, but even after 
eight months he was still not used 
to his light brown beard and long 
shaggy hair. 

Hurrying through the street, fol- 
lowing the one-way arrows which 
kept the trainees moving in the 
same direction, around and around 
the project, he felt the panic well 
up again. He made a wide detour 
of the excavation area which lay in 
the center of a rough square formed 
by the four apartment houses and 
the Administration Building. This 

THE OUTER QUIET 


forbidden area had been the cause 
of his first visit to Conqueror Puni- 
tive. Some two months ago, right 
after the last shipment of fresh 
trainees arrived, he had seen a 
group of women obviously new to 
the project, rigid in their terror of 
this silent hell, walking right in the 
direction of the excavation. With- 
out thinking, he had shouted a 
warning which stopped them from 
committing an offense. 

By the time he reached the base- 
ment of building two, he was gasp- 
ing for breath. If the last whistle 
sounded before he was seated at 
one of the long wooden tables, it 
would mean the third offense. 
There wasn’t any light-beam treat- 
ment for that one; only an elec- 
trode clamped to the head and the 
oblivion of thousands of volts of 
electricity. 

He went down the flight of steps 
into the basement which was dining 
room for all the male prisoners, 
and grasped a spoon, cup and plate 
from the tinware table just inside 
the door. The benches nearest the 
door were filled, but he didn’t have 
time to go any further. Just as he 
plumped between two trainees, the 
whistle sounded. 

He sat still a moment catching 
his breath, feeling the thin bodies 
adjust themselves away from him. 
Scooping some cereal from one of 
the center pots, he began to eat. 
The first mouthful stuck in his 
throat and he hastily filled his cup. 
But when he had gulped down the 
sugared water, a wave of nausea 
made him gag. He sat gripping the 
edge of the table, his head spinning. 
And thoughts crept into his mind 

97 



— thoughts and questions he 
wanted to keep out. 

Why were the trainees being 
starved? If the Conquerors wanted 
to kill them, it would be simple 
enough to use the quicker and less 
expensive method of firing squads. 
The training area was proof that 
they wanted workers for their new 
world. And despite the hunger 
which made hollow-eyed skeletons 
of them all, the men and women 
walked straighter and with definite 
confidence. Their lips were sealed 
shut, their eyes flickered observant- 
ly, their heads were always rigidly 
forward. Except for a few lingering 
misfits like himself, the group con- 
formed as well as humans ever 
could. Why then the delay in re- 
leasing them as had been promised? 

He screwed his eyes around and 
tried to see the other tables. Those 
even a short distance from the door 
were almost empty, and further in- 
to the hall they seemed deserted. 
He had no way of knowing the 
total number of men, but he was 
sure there weren’t more than a 
hundred — out of an original five 
hundred. If the same proportion 
held true for the women, there 
were less than two hundred Ameri- 
cans left in the project! 

He twisted his eyes to the person 
on his left. The face was that of a 
boy in his late teens — the beard 
spotty and thin. The head barely 
moved as he chewed, he held him- 
self rigid, his hand moved up to his 
mouth in a straight line and down 
the same way — he ate like a ma- 
chine. 

George swung his eyes to the 
right. Another young machine 

98 


turned out by the Conquerors. But 
was it only to be starved to death 
that these men, most of them so 
young, had obeyed? It made no 
sense and this, more than the con- 
formity to slavery, terrified him. 

But his terror lasted only a mo- 
ment. What had he to do with 
whether they lived or died? He was 
finished; all that mattered was see- 
ing Adele. 

He picked up his spoon and ate 
until the whistle shrieked its order 
for the walking to begin. Then he 
rose with utensils in hand and was 
carried to the door in the silent 
rush. As he dropped his tinware 
into the barrel of chlorinated water, 
he thought with bitter amusement 
that there was nothing for the Con- 
querors to do anymore — hardly a 
full day’s work for three or four 
men in operating the project now. 

W HEN he walked into the street, 
the sun was warmer. It was a 
beautiful day; almost summer, he 
thought, and he breathed deeply. 
But the smell of fresh growth was 
not in the air — only the dusty, 
burnt odor of the ruined city be- 
yond the walls. The sun grew 
brighter by the minute and he 
found it increasingly more difficult 
to see. It was as if the rays shat- 
tered into blinding blobs as they 
struck his eyes. Somehow, he knew 
he was using his ears more than 
ever before. 

Poor compensation, he thought. 
There was nothing to hear — no way 
of finding her by listening. And be- 
sides the absence of speech, there 
was the absence of any sound. 

HERBERT D. KASTLE 



He forced himself to place one 
leg after another, and all the hor- 
ror in the world crept into his 
brain. He wanted to turn around 
and speak to those in back of him 
— to stop the one-way tide of stroll 
and ask some questions. Just when 
had the last plane blurred by with 
jets roaring? And when had the 
Conquerors marched outside the 
wall, boots thudding, rifles clanking 
on canteen pack and buckle? When 
was the last atomic blast — a distant 
rumble causing the ground to trem- 
ble beneath the pavement? 

Months; two or even three, it 
seemed to him. His long legs fal- 
tered and he almost stumbled. 
Then he remembered his one pur- 
pose, and pushed the thoughts from 
his mind. 

By alternately hurrying and slow- 
ing his steps, he was able to pull 
alongside some trainees and let 
others catch up with him. With 
sidelong glances he tried to find 
Adele. He had to see her — to con- 
vince himself that she had not for- 
gotten the happy years together. 

It had been between buildings 
three and four — the women’s living 
quarters — that he had seen her that 
first and only time six months ago. 
He was walking quickly and pulled 
up beside her. One sidelong glance 
was exchanged and her face had 
filled with terror. Then she almost 
ran from him. He follQwed, but the 
weird chase ended after she actually 
turned to look back. 

Afraid she might commit further 
offenses in her efforts to avoid him, 
he had slowed his pace to a crawl 
and soon lost sight of her after turn- 
ing a few comers. Now his time 

THE OUTER QUIET 


was running out and he had to see 
her. She should be wiser in the 
ways of the camp; they could ex- 
change a glance and separate. But 
that glance would tell him whether 
or not she too had become a ma- 
chine. 

If she’s alive , a corner of his brain 
whispered. But he refused to think 
of her as being dead. 

The sun was getting hot and the 
faces he looked at were indistin- 
guishable in their blurry outlines. 
Nausea and dizziness returned and 
he could no longer concentrate on 
his search. 

It’s too late , he thought. The 
second treatment had finished his 
chances. 

He tried thinking of other things, 
to remember his feelings from the 
time of the blast to the day he had 
passed through the new brick wall 
into the project. But all he got was 
a blur of fear. Fear then, fear now, 
and fear until the day they would 
kill him. 

“Sick of fear!” a voice rusty from 
disuse rasped out. “Sick of the 
whole mess!” 

It was with a sense of complete 
surprise that he realized his mouth 
was open and it was his own voice 
shouting. 

“It’s over,” he rasped and turned 
around to face a startled, thin- 
faced woman whose blue eyes 
peered at him — but not with terror. 
He looked at her, his mouth sag- 
ging open. 

“Over for both of us,” she whis- 
pered, and moved toward him with 
arms outstretched and trembling. 

He tried to turn and run, to save 
her from further violations, but she 


99 



grasped his hand. 

“George.” And she was in his 
arms. “My third offense — when I 
stopped walking. There’s nothing 
to lose now.” 

The shuffling of feet continued 
about them as they embraced, and 
she talked hurriedly as if afraid 
that the few hours before the eve- 
ning meal would not be enough for 
all she had to say. 

“Tve walked behind you all these 
months. I was sure you would say 
something if you saw me and I 
didn’t want you to be punished. 
Each morning I waited until the 
last moment before leaving the 
women’s dining room — until you 
came by looking for me. Then I’d 
walk behind you, sometimes with- 
in touching distance. Once I had 
to wait too long, and then I went 
to Punitive for the second time. But 
it was all for nothing. I hoped you 
would go free, but it was all for 
nothing.” 

He kissed her then and she had 
to stop. When he took his lips 
from hers, they both turned to the 
nearest detector bulb. They were 
being watched, but what difference 
did a thousand violations make 
now? 

She was talking again, and ac- 
tually smiling. “You look distin- 
guished in a beard!” 

He laughed, and saw the nearby 
trainees pick up the forgotten 
sound. He took her lips back to 
his own and heard the shuffling 
feet slow down all around them. 
And the fear was gone. 

“Let’s go to the excavation,” he 
said. “We’ll sit down at the bottom 
in privacy and talk and laugh. 

100 


We’re free, Adele, and the rest 
doesn’t matter now.” 

He put his arm around her waist 
and they strolled against the pat- 
tern, the rigid walkers parting be- 
fore them. When they reached the 
huge pit he kicked at the OFF 
LIMITS sign and was surprised 
at how easily it fell. Then he took 
her hand and moved down the 
steep, sandy slope. 

It wasn’t until Adele moaned 
and closed her eyes tightly that he 
saw that the bottom of the pit was 
covered with stones — and clean 
white bones. The blood pounded 
in his temples as he stared at the 
piled skeletons and chemical stained 
earth. And the few hours of peace 
was no longer enough. 

Adele helped him pick up stones, 
until his hands and her cradled 
arms could hold no more. Bulbs, 
at least, could be broken. 

Up they climbed, and when they 
reached the pavement there were 
many trainees shuffling slowly past 
the spot where the sign lay. 

He threw the first stone at a de- 
tector bulb while still some distance 
from it, and his ruined eyes failed 
him. But the next time he stood 
directly beneath it and the shatter- 
ing of glass seemed as loud as the 
atomic blast had been. Down the 
street they went, smashing bulb 
after bulb, retrieving their missiles 
so as to have enough to last. And 
all the trainees moved slowly behind 
them, on up to the last bulb in 
front of the Administration Build- 
ing. 

The new sound was a sharp 
crack, and someone screamed in a 
rusty voice. He turned to see one 

HERBERT D. KASTLE 



of the crowd twitching on the 
pavement, then followed the faces 
turned up to Conqueror Punitive’s 
window. There was a shadow there 
— a shadow with a rifle. 

“The last bulb,” Adele said. 
“Smash it.” 

He drew back his arm and the 
crack of rifle fire reached him a 
second after the hot streak creased 
his shoulder. But he wasn’t hurt, 
and threw the stone. 

As the glass shattered there was 
an eruption of strange language 
from the building — a terrified 
shouting. The trainees stopped 
walking, then broke into frenzied 
movement and hoarse shouts. They 
pushed George and Adele aside in 
pursuit of the gray-uniformed fig- 
ure running toward the gate. The 
third shot was inside the building, 
and then the crowd picked up the 
fleeing Conqueror. His screams died 
quickly. 

Into the building the Americans 
poured — shaggy skeletons shrieking 
hatred. By the time George and 
Adele followed, men and women 
stood silently in the rooms and 
halls. Punitive looked ridiculously 
small crouched in a corner, his 
head back, the rifle between his 
knees with the barrel in his shat- 
tered mouth. The total number of 
gray-uniformed bodies was six, all 
but Punitive killed by the Ameri- 
cans. 

But the trainees began to file 
from the building and run back 
toward their rooms, for the body 
in the large room filled with com- 
plex electrical equipment was lying 
in front of a high-powered sending 
set — a radio whose tubes still 


glowed red. 

George looked at the radio, then 
at Adele. “They sent for help,” he 
whispered. “Soon, every American 
here will be dead. And it’s because 
of us.” 

She didn’t answer, and he ex- 
pected no answer. The room grew 
dark as they stood looking at the 
humming set. Then he fumbled 
over the dials, switched the current 
off, and led her out into the street. 

There was no whistle for the eve- 
ning meal. The streets were empty, 
and the silence hemmed them in 
like a solid wall. They walked to- 
ward the men’s feeding hall. 

Passing through the hall, they 
entered the door leading to the 
kitchen. There were huge electric 
stoves and further on, wheat and 
sugar sacks piled ceiling high. In a 
large bin they found various canned 
goods — the Conquerors’ personal 
food supply. The stoves worked, 
and Adele found an opener and 
pots in the glare of the unshaded 
light bulbs. They ate quickly; soup, 
meat, several cans of condensed 
milk. Then they left the basement 
and walked into the balmy eve- 
ning air. 

O N THE grassy spot in front of 
the Administration Building 
they loved each other desperately. 
Afterwards, they spoke of God, of 
what they believed would come 
after death, and were comforted. 
But they did not talk of what would 
happen to the others — that was too 
painful for words. 

Before he fell asleep, with Adele 
breathing regularly beside him, he 


THE OUTER QUIET 


101 



once again strained his ears to hear 
something — anything — from out- 

side the wall. Except for the ever- 
present hum of the oil-fed electric 
generators in the Administration 
Building, there was nothing. Not 
the bark of a dog or the scream 
of a cat or the clash of inanimate 
objects. Even the wind was dead. 
But he was too exhausted for fear, 
and slipped quickly into sleep. 
Once during the night, he awoke 
and raised his head to listen. When 
he lay back, there was a thought in 
his mind both terrible and full of 
hope. 

Adele awakened him in the 
morning. From the sun he could 
tell that it was past the time for 
the first meal. They went to the 
feeding hall and ate ; then returned 
to the grassy spot. This time they 
found little to speak of and sat 
silently, watching the gate. They 
watched until the sun dipped low 
and shadows engulfed the silent 
buildings. Then they saw the first 
trainees slipping toward the feed- 
ing hall; the women moving to- 
ward the men’s section in the need 
for comfort and protection. 

When George and Adele arrived 
in the kitchen, all the Americans 
were there. The women cooked 
the meal and whispered among 
themselves. The men sat talking, 
following the women with their 
eyes, trying to forget despair and 
certain death. 

They finished eating and sat 
quietly at the tables, husbands re- 
united with wives, boys and girls 
whispering to each other, all un- 
willing to return to the rooms, 
George spoke his thoughts. 

102 


It was hard to speak aloud; he 
had kept his thoughts to himself for 
so very long, but he managed to 
speak quietly and calmly. He re- 
minded them of the tactics the 
aliens had used to ensure obedi- 
ence, how they had held out the 
promise of freedom as a reward 
for conformity. How, backed by 
the fear and terror they were able 
to inspire with their drastic punish- 
ments, they were able to enslave all 
the Americans and keep them toe- 
ing the mark. How they had prob- 
ably felt secure enough in their 
conquest of the minds and bodies 
of their captives to leave the Earth 
in the hands of a few Punitives 
and a host of electronic gadgets. 
He told them, too, that the fact 
that no help had arrived despite 
the radio messages held the promise 
that the conquerors had no interest 
in Earth any longer; he assumed 
that they were busy elsewhere, or 
had merely conquered for the sheer 
joy of it, or that they lost interest 
. any reason would suffice. The 
important thing was that they 
they were free again. Free to live 
and laugh, to love and to hope . 
and to prepare a defense should 
the need arise. 

When he finished, even Adele 
looked at him with disbelief. But 
they all followed him to the Ad- 
ministration Building and one of 
the young men seated himself at 
the radio. Filling the room and 
overflowing into the hall, they 
waited. The youth knew his radios 
and manipulated the dials skillfully, 
but there was nothing except the 
crackle of static. With dread and 
hope mingled together, George 

HERBERT D. KASTLE 



listened to the empty airwaves — 
to the messages sent out on the 
sending set, and again to the bar- 
ren, static response. Then he turned 
to Adele and smiled weakly. 
“We’ve more than Noah had,” he 
said, and held her trembling hand. 

It was not until two days passed 
and the fuel for the generators had 
been exhausted that the first search 
party ventured into the city. The 
report was one word ringing hob 
lowly in the feeding hall. “Noth- 
ing.” 

Later expeditions utilized auto- 
mobiles from the city’s streets and 
traveled far out to other states. 
They returned with several hag- 
gard Americans and reports of 


some few surviving Conquerors. 
They also told of farms heavy with 
crops and of livestock wandering 
wild. But there were no large hu- 
man groups; no signs of organized 
humanity anywhere in the world. 

Two months after George and 
Adele Lowery’s revolt, the train- 
ees left the housing area for the 
fields where they could raise food 
and plan their civilization. George 
rode beside his wife in the lead 
car. There was no joy or laughter 
in them, nor would there be for 
many years. But the wrecked city 
fell behind, the green and brown 
of the fields took its place, and 
somewhere in the motorcade a 
voice began singing. • • •

duty, both men were still staring 
at the vast and tumbled desert of 
the Earth. • • •

Edith was just a computer, but a very good one 


and a very observing one. So it was quite natural that 


she be consulted about the doctor s murder . 


WITNESS 


BY GEORGE H. SMITH 


Illustrated by Kelly Freas 


B ALLARD was quite dead. 

There could be no doubt of 
it. He lay sprawled in front of 
Edith, with his head very messily 
bashed in and with one hand still 
extended toward her. A long shim- 
mering stream of blood ran half- 
way across the large room. Dr. 
Dudley Ballard had been as incon- 
siderate in his dying as he had been 
in his living. 

Art MacKinney and I stood in 
the doorway and stared. We were 
shocked not so much by the fact 
that Ballard was dead as by the 


fact that he lay in this most secret 
room, this holy of holies. Ours was 
the most security conscious project 
in the whole country; and this was 
where he had picked to get him- 
self killed. 

“God! There’ll really be a stink 
about this,” MacKinney breathed. 

“Well, I can’t think of anyone 
who had it coming more than he 
did,” I said. I hated Ballard’s guts 
and everyone knew it, so there was 
no point in being hypocritical now. 

Edith stood silently. She didn’t 
seem to be interested in the fact 


105 



that the man who had run her life, 
who had spent hours shouting 
questions at her and criticizing her 
slightest error with burning sar- 
casm was now dead. No, Edith 
wasn’t interested, but you couldn’t 
really expect her to be — she was 
only a computing machine, a me- 
chanical brain, the final result of 
years of work by the best cyber- 
netics experts in the world. Edith 
was silent, and would be, until we 
turned her on and fed the tapes 
into her. 

“It looks as though this is what 
did it,” MacKinney said, indicating 
a large spanner lying on the floor 
beside Ballard. He touched it gin- 
gerly with his foot. His face was 
white and strained and it occurred 
to me that he was more upset than 
I thought he should be. After all, 
he had as much reason to hate the 
dead man as the rest of us. Ballard 
had taken advantage of his position 
as head of the research project to 
make passes at Jane Gurrey and 
MacKinney wasn’t at all a cool 
scientist when it came to Jane. He 
was engaged to her and quite nat- 
urally resented Ballard’s attentions 
to her. 

“You’d better not touch that un- 
til the police get here,” I said as he 
bent over to pick up the spanner. 

“Yeah, I guess you’re right — I 
forgot. How do you suppose this 
got in here anyway?” 

“One of the workmen making 
adjustments on Edith’s outer casing 
must have left it. I saw it sitting up 
there on top of her late yesterday 
afternoon,” I told him. “You’d bet- 
ter go call Mr. Thompson and — 
the FBI.” 


With Ballard gone, I was in 
charge. Maybe someone would 
think that was reason enough for 
me to kill him. I didn’t care, I was 
just glad he was gone. Now he 
couldn’t mistreat Edith anymore. 

I turned Edith on just as Mac- 
Kinney returned. “What are you 
doing?” he asked. 

“Why I’m going to wake Edith 
up and feed these tapes into her. 
After all these are more important 
than any one man’s life.” 

“You didn’t care much for Bal- 
lard, did you Bill?” 

I gave him look for look as I re- 
plied. “Can you name anyone 
around here that did?” 

He shook his head. “No — 
I guess not. But maybe it wasn’t one 
of us. It might have been an out- 
side job, you know. Edith was work- 
ing on that space station stuff and 
the iron curtain people would give 
a lot to know about it.” 

“Hell,” I said pressing the studs 
and levers that would arouse Edith 
and put her to work. “You don’t 
really think anyone could get past 
those security guards, do you?” 
Happily I went about the 
business of waking Edith, my sleep- 
ing beauty, from her slumbers. In 
a very few seconds, her hundreds of 
tiny red eyes were gleaming with 
intelligence. 

Good morning , Edith I punched 
out the tape and fed it into her. 

There was the faintest pause, 
while Edith’s photo-electric cells 
surveyed the room, pausing for a 
moment on the sprawled body of 
Ballard. 

Good morning , Bill Green , she 
typed back. I knew she was happy 

GEORGE H. SMITH 


106 



to see me by the cheerful little 
clicks she emitted. 

I have some interesting work for 
you this morning , Edith. And I 
think you y U be glad to know that 
we will be working together from 
now on instead of . 

“Hey! What’s the idea of start- 
ing that machine?” a gray haired, 
gray suited security agent de- 
manded, striding into the room 
with MacKinney, Mr. Thompson 
and several other officers at his 
heels. “Don’t you know enough 
not to touch anything in here?” 

“This work is too important to 
be stopped — even for a murder,” 
I said, and Mr. Thompson nodded 
in agreement. 

“That’s right,” he said mopping 
his perpetually perspiring forehead, 
“this work has top priority from 
Washington.” He looked nervous 
and I couldn’t help wondering 
what he was thinking. There had 
been stories circulating about Bal- 
lard and Thompson’s wife and the 
dome-headed little man must have 
heard them too. Ballard just 
couldn’t keep his hands off any fe- 
male within reach. That was one 
of the reasons he was so thoroughly 
hated. 

The youngest of the security 
agents rose from where he had been 
kneeling beside Ballard and crossed 
to me. 

“You’re Green, aren’t you?” I 
nodded and he continued, “How 
did you know it was murder?” 

I laughed at him. “How the hell 
could a man bash in his own brains 
that way?” 

The gray haired man stepped 
into the breach. He gave us all a 

WITNESS 


thorough going over, but concen- 
trated on MacKinney and me. He 
seemed to think it peculiar that 
neither of us could give any reason 
for Ballard’s being alone with 
Edith. I was sure I knew, but no 
one would have believed me so I 
made no attempt to enlighten him. 

“Well, I guess that’s all we can 
do now,” he said at last. “Someone 
from the local police will have to be 
notified and brought in after they 
get security clearance.” He turned 
to go. 

“Wait a minute,” MacKinney 
said, “we’re all overlooking one 
thing.” 

“What’s that?” 

“There was an eye witness to 
this crime,” he said, and I stared 
at him in consternation. I didn’t 
know he knew. I thought I was the 
only one who knew. 

“What do you mean,” the agent 
demanded angrily. 

“Edith saw it. Edith, the com- 
puter.” 

“Are you nuts?” the agent de- 
manded. 

“You forget that Edith was 
turned off,” Thompson said. 

“But Mr. Thompson, Edith’s not 
like most cybernetic machines. She’s 
so far advanced, that I’m not sure 
we understand her completely. She 
can’t really be turned off. She has 
a distinct personality and that new 
circuit — ” 

Of course Edith had a person- 
ality of her own! She had more 
charm, more intelligence, more 
understanding than most women. 

“ — well — she’d be able to tell us 
who killed Ballard.” 

“That’s ridiculous,” I said, badly 

107 



frightened. “A machine can’t be a 
witness to murder.” 

The security officer looked du- 
bious and shook his head. “I guess 
we’ll have to leave that up to the 
coroner at the inquest.” 

“But they can’t ask questions like 
that of Edith,” I protested. “She’s 
— she’s too important to the na- 
tional defense to have some country 
coroner asking her silly questions 
about the murder of a man who de- 
served to die anyway.” I had to pre- 
vent this. I had to get around this 
eye witness business. 

Thompson looked at me levelly. 
“MacKinney may be right, Green. 
The coroner may very well want 
to talk to Edith and there’s no 
reason we should object if Security 
gives him clearance.” 

“But Mr. Thompson, our work 
— it’ll be interrupted.” 

“We’ll have to take that chance. 
And I think Washington will 
agree.” 

“But — ” Couldn’t they see that 
there wasn’t any question of spying 
here. Couldn’t they understand 
that Ballard had just gotten what 
he had coming. I couldn’t let them 
question Edith. At least not until I 
had a chance to talk to her alone. 

“And Green — because of your 
rather strange behaviour, I’m 
afraid I’ll have to ask you to stay in 
your quarters until the inquest. 
MacKinney will handle your work 
with Edith until then.” 

I was shocked and really fright- 
ened now. I wouldn’t get to talk 
to her, wouldn’t get a chance to tell 
her what to say. I protested, but 
Thompson was firm, so firm that 
he placed a guard outside my door 

108 


to make sure I didn’t leave. 

Washington rushed through 
clearance for the local officers and 
the inquest was held three days 
later. The coroner proved to be a 
shrewd country doctor, who had 
the inquest adjourned to the com- 
puter room as soon as he heard 
MacKinney’s ideas about Edith. 

The security guards on duty the 
night of the murder testified that 
only MacKinney, Thompson, Bal- 
lard and I had had access to the 
computer room ; and it had already 
been established that it would 
have been impossible for a spy or 
foreign agent to have slipped into 
the heavily guarded room. It was 
clearly an inside job. 

With all of us at the scene of the 
crime, the coroner summed it up 
for us. “ — and since it could not 
have been the work of an outsider, 
it must have been a crime of a pri- 
vate nature.” He looked closely at 
Thompson, MacKinney and me. 
“A crime of a private nature with 
the motive either revenge, jeal- 
ousy or ambition. We know that 
the victim was an over-bearing man 
with a good many unpleasant 
traits. We know he was a man who 
forced his attentions on women, 
who was ill-tempered and abusive 
to those who worked with him. A 
man who had many enemies — but 
there were only three people who 
had the chance to attack him on 
this particular night. 

“I am going to attempt to estab- 
lish the identity of the killer by the 
unusual procedure of questioning 
a machine. It will be for later 
courts to establish the validity of 
such testimony. Because of the na- 

GEORGE H. SMITH 



ture of this case and because of the 
urgent need to get this computer 
back to its proper work, I am go- 
ing to ask the questions in a more 
direct manner than I would ordi- 
narily employ.” 

MacKinney took his place before 
Edith. They didn’t even trust me 
to feed the tapes into her under 
their very eyes. 

“Mr. Thompson, I object to the 
use of this delicate piece of equip- 
ment in — ” 

They ignored me, and Mac- 
Kinney punched out the questions 
the coroner asked: 

“Do you know who murdered 
Dr. Ballard?” 

There was a pause. Edith blinked 
several times. I was shaking with 
apprehension for her. A mind so 
delicate and noble should not be 
faced with such a dilemma. 

Yes , she typed hack . 

“Did you witness the murder?” 

There was a longer pause this 
time. “You must answer the ques- 
tion,” MacKinney reminded her. 

1 was here . 

“Is it true that you do not lose 
your perceptive qualities when we 
turn you off?” MacKinney asked 
this on his own. 

It is true . 

“We might as well get to the 
heart of the matter,” the coroner 
said. “Did Mr. Thompson kill Bal- 
lard?” 

Edith clicked and her eyes 
glowed. No . 

“Did Mr. MacKinney kill Bal- 
lard?” 

No. 

Edith had to tell the truth . 
it was an innate part of her person- 

WITNESS 


ality. I tensed in my seat. I wanted 
to scream, to leap at MacKinney 
and prevent, somehow, the asking 
of the next question. But there 
wasn’t a chance. 

“Did Mr. Green kill Dr. Bal- 
lard?” 

Edith’s beautiful electric eyes 
flashed and her clicks pulsed twice 
as rapidly as before. There was such 
a roaring and wrenching within 
her I was afraid for her — she was 
being torn apart in her struggle not 
to answer. I couldn’t stand listen- 
ing to her desperate efforts any 
longer. 

“Yes!” I leapt to my feet. “Yes, 
I did it. Leave her alone. Can’t you 
see what you’re doing to her? That 
swine was always mistreating her. 
He didn’t understand her — no one 
understands her as I do!” 

The coroner looked at me 
closely. “Is that really why you 
killed him, Mr. Green?” 

“No! You were wondering why 
he was here by himself while no 
work was going on. He — he had 
begun to feel about Edith as he did 
about all women. He sneaked back 
here to be alone with her. He 
wanted to — he wanted to — ” My 
voice broke and they stared at me 
in shocked amazement. 

Into the silence MacKinney read 
what Edith had slowly typed out: 
“Mr. Green did not kill Dr. Bal- 
lard.” 

“Yes— yes I did,” I screamed. 
“Don’t Edith—” 

“Who did kill him?” the coroner 
asked, quietly. 

This was the question I had 
wanted to avoid. I sank down my 
hands cradling my aching head. 

109 



Edith must have expected the ques- 
tion. She had her answer ready. 

1 refuse to state on the grounds 
that it may tend to incriminate me. 

My poor, sweet, adorable Edith. 
If only I had had a chance to talk 
to her, to tell her what to say. I had 
known . ever since I had seen 
the spanner and remembered where 
it had been before. I could have 
warned her to say that Ballard had 


attacked her, threatened her, to 
say anything . but not to attempt 
to hide behind a Fifth Amendment 
that didn’t exist anymore. My darl- 
ing, never had kept up with cur- 
rent events. 

Now they’ll disconnect her, 
they’ll rewire her, they’ll destroy her 
understanding, her warmth, her 
whole personality . and I ... I 
love her, I love her ... • • •

FIRTH’S WORLD 


His world was Utopia inhabited only by wealthy, brilliant , 
creative , ambitious people; it was the ultimate in freedom, ex- 
empt from taxes, social problems, petty responsibilities . 


BY IRVING COX, JR. 


L ET HIM go. It’s quite safe to 
leave us. I want to talk to him. 
Sit over there, Chris, where you 
can be comfortable. 

A paradox, isn’t it? You were 
taught we may never go back. Now 
I’ve authorized the building of the 
rocket. From your point of view 
you were justified in trying to de- 
stroy it. I’m violating the regula- 
tions; you weren’t. But time changes 
the shape of the truth, Chris; it 
isn’t static. No one had the insight, 
then, to grasp the insanity of John 
Firth’s dream. People hated Firth 
or envied him; but no one called 
him mad. 

John Firth was an industrialist; 
yet far more than that, too — poli- 
tician, scientist, financier, even an 


artist of sorts. There was nothing 
he couldn’t do; and few things he 
didn’t do superbly well. That ac- 
counts for his philosophy. He never 
understood his own superiority. He 
honestly believed that all men could 
achieve what he had, if they set 
their minds to it. 

“Lazy, incompetent fools!” he 
would say. “The world’s full of 
them. And they’ve elected a gov- 
ernment of fools, taxing me to sup- 
port the others.” 

As billionaires go, John Firth was 
very young. Six months after World 
Government became an established 
reality, Earth ships began to ex- 
plore the skies; and in less than a 
year Mars, Venus and the Earth 
had formed a planetary confed- 
eracy. 


Ill 



A new feeling came to men when 
the burden of war-fear was lifted 
from their minds. Men were free — 
free for the first time in centuries. 
Their full energies were channeled 
into invention, exploration, experi- 
ment. The Earth was like a frontier 
town: booming, uproarious, lusty, 
dynamic — but with a social con- 
science : poverty and deprivation 
for none and unlimited opportunity 
for all. For Man — that abstract 
symbol of mass humanity — it was 
the best of all possible worlds. Yet 
there were misfits; John Firth was 
one of them. 

“We’re coddling people,” he said. 
“We’re teaching them to live on 
charity, on government hand-outs 
— and I’m expected to pay for it all. 
Cut them loose; let them sink or 
swim for themselves. If some of 
them don’t survive — well, they 
won’t; that’s all. We’d be a stronger 
people if we could rid ourselves of 
the leeches.” 

He was a man of the new age, — 
stubbornly holding to ideas from the 
old. 

And then the Stranger came to 
see him. We don’t know who the 
Stranger was or where he came 
from. A force of evil, perhaps — the 
symbol of Satan refurbished and 
streamlined to fit the concepts of 
the modem world. 

“I’ve been reading your political 
pamphlets, Mr. Firth,” the Stranger 
said. “You hold rather — rather fas- 
cinating views.” 

“Now that I’m suitably flat- 
tered,” Firth answered, “may I ask 
what particular form of hand-out 
you want?” 

“None. I’ve something for sale.” 


The Stranger took a pamphlet out 
of his pocket. “But tell me this, 
first: do you honestly believe what 
you’ve written here?” 

“Every word of it. If I could find 
my sort of world anywhere in the 
universe, I’d pull up stakes in a 
minute and — ” 

“You can create your own world, 
Mr. Firth.” 

“Do you suppose I haven’t tried? 
In every election I back my can- 
didates with all I have — prestige, 
propaganda, money. It does no 
good. The fools prefer to be gov- 
erned by other fools, like them- 
selves.” 

“I didn’t mean here, Mr. Firth.” 
The Stranger smiled as he lit a 
cigarette. “You see, my friend, I 
have a world for sale — a brand new 
world.” 

“One of the asteroids?” Firth 
laughed bitterly. “I could have 
done that years ago. They’re too 
close to the commercial orbits. How 
long would it be before one of our 
ships found the place? Then I’d be 
right back in the system again — and 
a laughing stock as well.” 

“This is a planetoid beyond 
Pluto. It’ll be generations before 
any of our ships — ” 

“A frozen world? No thanks!” 
“Only on the surface. It’s a hol- 
low sphere, with a granite crust half 
a mile thick. Inside there’s a sug- 
gestion of passageways and caverns, 
which may have been made arti- 
ficially. Perhaps this was an outpost 
of a race which lived and died bil- 
lions of years before our time.” 

“An archeological gold mine!” 
“But Science pays so little, Mr. 
Firth. I’m interested in cash, not 

IRVING COX, JR. 


112 



prestige.” 

“Why should I pay you anything? 
You’ve told me where it is and what 
it is. I can find it for myself.” 

The Stranger laughed. “I said 
beyond Pluto; that covers a lot of 
space, Mr. Firth.” He paused for a 
moment. “My price is the stock in 
your Martian mines. Convert the 
rest of your holdings into any form 
of wealth that seems convenient 
and usable. In your case, Mr. Firth, 
you can take it with you — to your 
own world. Think of it! No taxes; 
no social problems; no unfortunate 
masses to prey on your conscience; 
no government but your own.” 

That was the beginning of the 
dream. The seed of the idea grew 
in John Firth’s mind until it over- 
shadowed everything else. It be- 
came an obsession, driving him so 
that he had no peace. 


D URING the course of a year 
Firth and the Stranger im- 
ported and installed the machinery 
to make the sphere livable: hydro- 
ponic tanks, air machines, gravita- 
tors, electric generators and an 
Atomic Power Core. In the crust of 
the planetoid they found enough 
fissionable material to keep Firth’s 
world running for an eternity. They 
laid out the decorative landscaping, 
planned the living quarters, the 
laboratories, the amusement hall 
and the university. 

It is interesting to speculate how 
much the Stranger contributed to 
the scheme ; and it is an ironic 
speculation, for as soon as the larger 
idea took shape in Firth’s mind, his 
only logical course was to murder 

FIRTH'S WORLD 


the Stranger. 

Firth could allow no outsider to 
know of the planetoid. To him it 
had become far more than a means 
of personal escape. It was to be an 
archive for the survival of John 
Firth’s ideas, for the survival of 
civilization itself. John Firth be- 
lieved that sincerely. 

Firth’s world — that magnificent 
dream which was like a holy cru- 
sade — was founded on murder, de- 
ception and greed. The reasoning 
of fanaticism engenders its own 
kind of ruthlessness. As soon as 
John Firth had disposed of the 
Stranger, he began to select his 
colonists. Men who by his defini- 
tion, were not fools. He had to 
make his choice very carefully. If 
he misjudged his candidate and his 
proposition was rejected, Firth had 
given away his secret. Any man who 
refused him had to die. Murder was 
Firth’s only guarantee of silence. 

But he made few mistakes. John 
Firth was a good judge of men — 
his kind of men. All of them were 
wealthy, ambitious, brilliant. Near- 
ly three hundred men and women 
were recruited. 

They came here to escape; the 
record tells us that until we gag 
over the repetition. But to escape 
what? Taxes they resented unan- 
imously, and restrictions on their 
freedom. They placed a value on 
the ownership of property that we 
can no longer understand. But, if 
you read the record closely, all that 
becomes superfluous. The thing 
they wanted to escape was respons- 
ibility. Responsibility to their fellow 
men. 

Physically, Firth’s world was a 

113 



paradise. It still is. Yet the dissolu- 
tion began before the last colonist 
had arrived. Here they had assem- 
bled their wealth — in terms of ma- 
chines, comforts, books, art treas- 
ures, amusements, laboratory equip- 
ment. They were entirely free from 
the burden of taxation. But, some- 
how, their wealth lost its meaning. 

They claimed they had not with- 
drawn from the world in order to 
hibernate and decay among their 
luxuries. They wanted freedom in 
order to create, to invent, to experi- 
ment as they pleased. And they had 
that in Firth’s world: a maximum 
opportunity for the development of 
individual initiative. For a short 
time they turned out a wonderful 
assortment of new gadgets and new 
machines, but slowly their industry 
ground to a stop. 

If they had faced the truth then 
— but they were far too human to 
admit the failure of the dream. In- 
stead, they found a scapegoat. John 
Firth has left us a record of a con- 
versation he had with Adam 
Boetz; it is typical of their think- 
ing at the time. 

Boetz, as you may know, was one 
of the outstanding physicists of his 
day; he had created and built 
Atomic Cores, Incorporated, until 
it was the largest power company 
in the Confederation. 

John Firth met Boetz one morn- 
ing on the golf course in the recre- 
ation cavern. 

“Adam!” Firth cried, with his 
usual, boisterous good-humor. “I 
never thought I’d find you out here 
at this time of day.” 

“Why not?” The physicist 
shrugged. “I’m tired, Firth. I had 

114 


to do my four hour shif t in the light 
plant last night. Maybe I’ll feel like 
working in the lab tomorrow — and 
maybe not. I’m scheduled for a 
shift in hydroponics then.” 

“The shifts are short, Adam, and 

“Still too long for me, I’m not 
used to so much physical labor.” 
The physicist’s lips curled in a 
sneer. “So very democratic, isn’t it, 
Firth? Back home I hired men to 
do that kind of work for me.” 

Firth clapped him heartily on the 
back. “But we have other compen- 
sations, Adam. Four hours out of 
twenty-four is a small price to pay 
for freedom.” 

“Twenty-eight hours a week. Re- 
member the new labor law the 
Earth government put into effect 
before we left? It proscribed a max- 
imum work week of twenty-five 
hours for every man. We came here 
to escape restrictions, but we’ve 
saddled ourselves with more hours 
of manual labor than the least 
skilled laborer has to do on Earth. 
Firth! I’m not a manual laborer; 
neither is anyone else you’ve 
brought here.” 

“Do you want to go back?” 

“What answer can I make to 
that? We’re executives, Firth; but 
here we’re a brain without a body. 
We can formulate the orders, but 
we’ve neither arms nor legs to carry 
them out.” 

“In other words, you’re saying we 
should import a labor force to do 
our basic work for us?” 

“Why not?” 

“They’re the fools, Adam, the in- 
competents! On Earth they were 
the millstones around our necks — 


IRVING COX, JR. 



envying us, hating us, building a 
prison for us with their laws and 
their regulations.” 

“All very true, Adam, where the 
government is in their hands. But 
we could keep them under con- 
trol.” 

After that John Firth heard the 
same complaint from the others, 
over and over. They said they could 
not take advantage of their free- 
dom because of the chores they had 
to do to keep Firth’s world func- 
tioning. 

Firth called a meeting of the 
colonists. It was the closest ap- 
proximation to a government they 
had; government itself was one 
of the things they wanted to escape. 
They unanimously agreed that a 
labor force had to be recruited, 
and they settled upon one hundred 
and fifty as the necessary number, 
half of them to be women. Work- 
ing eight hours a day, such a force 
could perform the work of Firth’s 
world, yet the colonists would out- 
number them two-to-one and the 
labor force would not be large 
enough to constitute a threat. 

“We’ll insist that they marry, of 
course,” Adam Boetz said, “and 
each couple will provide us with 
two children, so that we shall al- 
ways have a stabilized labor 
supply.” 

“We’re talking,” one of the 
women whispered, “as if we were 
buying cattle!” 

“We are.” 

“But how can you recruit men 
and women under these conditions? 
What inducement can you possibly 
offer them?” 

Firth smiled. “When we find the 


people who meet our specifications, 
they’ll come; don’t worry. In the 
days of the sailing ships the tech- 
nique was called shanghaiing.” 
“What specifications, Mr. Firth?” 
“They must be young, strong, 
healthy, single — ” 

“And low-level morons,” Adam 
Boetz cut in. “Imbeciles won’t give 
us any trouble later on.” 

To his other crimes, John Firth 
then added kidnapping; the end 
justified the means. He was creat- 
ing a world and that world would 
save civilization. I doubt that his 
conscience ever troubled him. 


W ITHIN two years the second 
group of colonists was estab- 
lished in Firth’s world. Apparently 
they made an easy adjustment to 
their new environment. We have 
no record of complaints or pro- 
tests. They were docile, obedient 
people. They took orders well; they 
liked to be told what to do; they 
needed very little supervision. 

The first colonists were entirely 
free, then, of any sort of work-re- 
sponsibility. For a while they went 
back to work in their laboratories 
or in the university — inventing, ex- 
ploring, accumulating their store 
of knowledge. In imperceptible 
stages, however, their interest 
lagged, their production came to a 
halt again. This time they had no 
excuse, no scapegoat. 

We can assume that some of 
them faced the truth squarely and 
honestly, yet they had chosen 
Firth’s world and there was no way 
to turn back. We find only one 
actual hint of their despondency, 

115 


FIRTH'S WORLD 



in a diary page written by an un- 
known woman. 

Karl stayed home again to- 
day . He has nearly finished the 
design for his machine , but he 
has no more enthusiasm to com- 
plete it . 1 know how he feels; 1 
can y t go on with my painting , 
either . We have no purpose, no 
goal to achieve. We sit isolated 
in space, counting over the wealth 
of our talent and ability; but we 
can make no use of it. I wish I 
knew how many of the others 
think as 1 do, but I’m afraid to 
ask . 

The key to understanding them, 
is that last sentence. Perhaps they 
all felt her disillusionment, but they 
had to pretend. Firth’s world 
couldn’t be at fault. If they were 
dissatisfied, it was because of a 
failure within themselves. At all 
costs, the flaw had to be hidden 
from their neighbors. 

Their first labor trouble was a 
welcome interlude in the creep- 
ing boredom. The docile labor 
battalion suddenly discovered they 
were being overworked. Just what 
they could have done in Firth’s 
world with shorter hours, no one 
knows. They staged a spotty, am- 
ateurish strike; speakers made ref- 
erence to the labor laws applicable 
on the Earth and demanded better 
pay. To what end, it’s hard for 
us to say. If the first colonists had 
turned over all their wealth, the 
workers would have had no more 
use for it. 

John Firth was unusually a- 
larmed by the threatened strike. He 
reacted with excessive violence and 

116 


the other colonists followed his 
lead. Three of the leaders of the 
uprising were executed ; others were 
brutally whipped. The Outlaw Pit 
was built then. Thereafter, at the 
first hint of any dissatisfaction, 
workers were condemned to it. 

The violence taught the workers 
resentment. Silently, sullenly they 
passed on their hatred to their chil- 
dren. The aristocracy created the 
revolution, and nurtured it; for it 
would have made no real differ- 
ence if they had surrendered en- 
tirely to the strikers’ demands. 

The children of the first colon- 
ists made no pretense of using 
Firth’s world to advance knowl- 
edge, invention or art. They were 
hedonists, bred to luxury, sup- 
ported by slaves. 

The slaves, for their part, felt no 
emotion but hatred. From their 
parents they learned that the aris- 
tocracy had violated the labor law. 
The children knew nothing about 
the law or the distant Earth where 
it applied, but it was held in deep 
and sacred reverence. 

The laboratories and the uni- 
versity stood empty; only the recre- 
ation cavern held any interest for 
the new aristocracy. A change took 
place among the slaves too. Their 
parents had been hand-picked 
morons. But neither brilliant a- 
chievement nor the moronic mind 
is hereditary. Most of the workers’ 
children had an average intelli- 
gence ; one or two would have been 
classified as geniuses. To their 
hatred the second generation joined 
intelligence, and Firth’s world was 
ready to blow apart. 

They struck the light plant first. 

IRVING COX, JR. 



Sudden and unexpected violence 
surged through the dark, stone- 
walled corridors. 

John Firth led a band of men 
against the enemy. But his attack 
failed and the workers seized the 
Atomic Power Core — the heart of 
our world. If they shut down the 
reactors, they would stifle not only 
our lights, but the gravitators and 
the air machines as well; they 
would kill us all. 

The workers knew that. They 
were willing to risk suicide. Every 
bargaining counter was on their 
side. It was John Firth who sur- 
rendered. 

Firth’s world died then. In the 
bitter depths of the Pit, John Firth 
remembered what Adam Boetz had 
said to him so many years before, 

“We’ve become a brain without 
a body. We can formulate the 
orders, but we’ve neither arms nor 
legs to carry them out. 

Suddenly John Firth understood 
the fallacy of his fanaticism. A so- 
ciety was like a living body, an in- 
tegrated organism of many mem- 
bers. No one could function with- 
out the others. No man — no group 
of men — could create an isolate 
world. The social equation seemed 
as clear to Firth as the simplest 
sum in arithmetic. Each man was 
a part of a functioning social unit 
which included them all. Each 
man’s talent, whether it was the 
plodding docility of a moron or 
the brilliance of genius, belonged 
to all men. 

In the meantime, the workers 
found that they could not run 
Firth’s world alone, either. They 

FIRTH'S WORLD 


gloried in forbidden luxuries until 
they were satiated. Shortly they be- 
came as indolent as the aristocracy 
had been; and the food supply was 
nearly exhausted. 

The treaty they made was direct 
and to the point: the two groups 
agreed to live in equality, sharing 
the burden of the labor and the ac- 
cumulated wealth of knowledge. 
The treaty was made when you 
were a child ; we have perfected the 
technique of co-operation within 
one generation. We’re ready, now, 
to go back to Earth. 

You’ll be with us? Fine, Chris! 
No. Please, no apologies. I un- 
derstand why you intended to des- 
troy our ship ; others have at- 
tempted it, too. No harm was done. 
You’re free, — entirely free . 

. The Organizer waited until 
he was alone in the office. Then, 
with trembling, aging hands, he 
took the log book out of the safe 
and slowly made another entry: 

Chris was the last , 1 think . He 
accepted the lie , just as most of 
the others have. When they re- 
turn to Earth , they will be sound 
men with whole minds. For them 
Firth’s world will always stand 
as a symbol of man’s highest 
achievement in co-operation . 
May this sham , in some small 
way , expiate the crime and the 
folly of my arrogant delusion . 

John Firth’s head dropped on 
his arm and his shoulders shook; 
but the sobs were sobs of relief. 
Chris was saved; Chris would go 
back. That mattered very much — 
for Chris was his grandson. • • •

SCIENCE 




If current experiments prove suc- 
cessful, pilots of the future may be 
talking with their ears as well as 
hearing through them. Based on 
the fact that the ear is a human 
two-way radio the researchers have 
succeeded in getting intelligible 
speech from the ears of several 
persons involved in the tests. They 
are quite certain that further stud- 
ies and experiments will point the 
way to further improvement of the 
technique; and that in the future 
people will be able to be taught 
how to use the Eustachian tubes 
or the bones of the head as a sound- 
ing board for emitting speech as 
well as hearing it. 

The daily round of the morning 
milk man may soon be a thing of 
the past. Researchers at Iowa State 
College have developed a frozen 
concentrated milk which the house- 
wife may use in the same way she 
now uses frozen orange juice. The 
product is a whole milk product 
tasting exactly like regular bottled 
milk and with the same food values. 
A quart of the concentrate can be 
expanded to three quarts of reg- 
ular milk by the addition of two 
quarts of water and stirring. Cans 


may be kept in the home refriger- 
ator for two weeks without danger 
of spoilage and may be stored more 
than five months in freezer lockers 
at temperatures between 15 to 20 
degrees below zero Fahrenheit. 

The walls of your house of the 
future may be built of plastic foam 
which can be “foamed” into place 
rather than hammered or nailed, 
or laid by a stone mason. Research- 
ers at the Dow Chemical corpor- 
ation are toying with a device re- 
sembling a garbage can that would 
be a plastic “concrete” mixer. It 
would generate foam and force it 
through a hose to a workman. Us- 
ing only rudimentary forms to con- 
tain the plastic until set, the work- 
man would build the wall up 
quickly. Experts would then focus 
the radiation from high-voltage X- 
ray machines or radioactive cobalt 
60 on the walls to raise its structural 
strength by cross-linking the plastic 
molecules. 

Spare parts surgery of the future 
may soon include the grafting of 
plugs of living tissue into the hu- 
man heart itself. Researchers be- 
lieve that incompetent heart valves 
might better be repaired by using 
tissue from elsewhere in the body. 
In experiments they have used a 
plug of tissues consisting mainly of 
blood vessels. They pass this 
through the left auricle of the heart, 
through the mitral opening and 
into the left ventricle where it is 
finally anchored by stitching it to 
the wall of this heart chamber. 
There it functions as a substitute 
mitral valve between the two left 


118 



heart chambers. If the present tests 
prove successful, this new tech- 
nique may soon be an accepted 
form of heart surgery. 

Rocket fuel may be used as a cool- 
ant to prevent rocket planes of the 
future from melting at high speeds. 
When projectiles reach a speed five 
or six times the speed of sound, such 
intense heat is generated that alum- 
inum and steel melt; and research- 
ers are experimenting with the fuel 
as an answer to the problem. They 
agree that such research on thermal 
barrier problems has been lagging 
far behind the capabilities of air- 
craft engineers, and hope that this 
present research will solve the 
problem. The only alternative so 
far seems to accept the fact that

planes will have to be partially re- 
built after each flight that lasts 
more than a few minutes. 

Dehydrofreezing may be a word 
to conjure with in the not too dis- 
tant tomorrow. It is a name given 
to a new process which combines 
the space-saving of dehydration 
with the advantages of freezing. 
Ordinary freezing tends to rupture 
the cellular structure of foods. Par- 
tial dehydration does much to over- 
come the objection and dehydro- 
frozen foods retain the right amount 
of moisture. They can be reconsti- 
tuted simply by soaking them in 
water. Scientists report that the pro- 
cess costs somewhat more, but low- 
er packaging, freezing, storage and 
distribution costs should result in 
an over-all saving to users. 

Safety engineers predict that all 
automobiles will soon come e- 
quipped with safety belts similar to 
those used in airplanes. Several 
years of research have gone into 
the study of the perfect seat belt 
and several points have come up 
which will make for the maximum 
safety. The loop strength of the 
belt and buckle should be no less 
than 3,000 pounds, no less than two 
inches wide, only one person should 
use each belt, the belt must be an- 
chored in a manner to transmit the 
full force of the belt’s 3,000 pound 
strength to the frame of the car 
and the belt from attachment point 
to hips should cross the pelvic re- 
gion at an angle of approximately 
45 degrees. These minimum re- 
quirements have been strongly rec- 


119 



ommended as a means of substan- 
tially reducing the nation’s huge 
traffic death and injury toll. 

A new wrinkle in the cultivation of 
the oceans for food has been pro- 
posed by researchers. Scientists 
have noted that there is a band 
500 miles on each side of the equa- 
tor which is almost perpetually 
calm and where the sun shines al- 
most every day with a steady tem- 
perature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit 
the year round. The development 
of extreme high-strength plastic 
films has made possible floating 
plastic stills, created under Depart- 
ment of Interior sponsorship, that 
convert salt water to fresh. Fresh 
water from these stills is used to 
cultivate plants floating in canoe- 
like plastic boats. One such float- 
ing garden is already in existence 
and flourishing mightily in the un- 
usual surroundings. 

Job seekers may one day have to 
submit to aptitude tests that in- 
clude a checking of their brain 
metabolism. Scientists have discov- 
ered that they can predict the be- 
havior of rats by checking the 
chemical activities of the brain. In 
running through a test maze the 


animals responded as visualists 
(they followed light and dark 
alleys) or spatialists (who run to 
the right or the left orientation of 
the alleys). When sample tissues 
were examined, the level of cho- 
linesterase enzyme in the spatialist’s 
brain areas was much higher than 
that of the visualists. Testing the 
enzyme activity beforehand gives 
an accurate prediction as to which 
of the categories the test animals 
will belong to. 

The telescope and electronic com- 
puter have been combined to locate 
the lost planet Athalia. With the 
combination, Dr. Paul Herget, of 
the Cincinnati Observatory, redis- 
covered the minor planet which had 
been lost for fifty years. The planet, 
originally discovered photograph- 
ically at the Heidelberg Observa- 
tory in Germany in 1903, was not 
photographed again until 1948, 
when Indiana University took 
about 2000 plates of minor planets. 
While checking the plates recently, 
Dr. Herget solved the problem of 
the orbit on a giant IBM computer. 
It took him exactly one minute to 
solve the problem which had 
plagued and teased astronomers for 
almost half a century.

“You can stop worrying, Jane. 
My job’s secure now! And here’s 
the insurance policy to prove it— 
my I.C.S. diploma!” 

Th is feeling of security is 
probably typical of every I.C.S. 
graduate. Because — as the job 
situation gets tighter, the man 
with I.C.S. training has the 
advantage. 

Why? Your I.C.S. diploma tells 
your present employer three im- 
portant things: (1) You want to 
make the most of your present job. 


(2) You have the training you 
need for advancement. (3) You 
look for better ways of doing things 
on your own. 

What you do about your fu- 
ture is up to you. Do nothing 
and stay at your present job at 
the same old pay. Or earn an 
I.C.S. diploma in your spare 
time for security , promotions , 
more pay! Your first step is to 
mark the course that interests 
you in the coupon below, and 
mail it to us.
