It’s 1972’s turn. 



Lift the taboos, the publishing restrictions, 
the "rules” that SF writers have had to live 
by. That’s what Harlan Ellison did to put 
together the freest, wildest, most con- 
troversial collection of original stories 
and short novels ever published. 720 
pages of authors like Kurt Vonnegut, 

Jr., Ray Bradbury, Kate Wilhelm, James 
Blish and 38 others giving you 
their visions of man’s fu- 
ture here, and all over the 
universe. Harlan Ellison, 
who has already won 
Hugo and Nebula Awards 
galore, also edited DAN- 
GEROUS VISIONS, the 
book the 26th World Sci- 
ence Fiction Convention 
called "the most signifi- 
cant SF book published 
In 1967.”

One question, above all, struck terror 
into the intruder. What is man? 



vacuum and began to peer ahead. A

blinder was drawn across the image 
of the nearing star, so that tiny 
flecks of light near it could 
register. 

The telescope employed had a 
diameter of about sixty inches. It 
did not differ markedly from those 
used in the early twentieth century 
on Earth, for after a certain point 
technology cannot improve a tele- 
scope’s ability to resolve faint dots 
of light. 

The craft crept along at far below 
lightspeed. Isotopes met with a low 
mumble in the throat of its exhaust 
—fingers of magnetic fields pre- 
ceding it plucked the atoms and 
funneled them in from the sur- 
rounding interstellar gas. Only this 
disturbed the aching reaches among 
the stars. 

The craft watched patiently. Any 
planets orbiting the star ahead were 
still far away. A series of precise 
image recordings were necessary if 
the computers were to pick out a 
planet moving against the speckled 
background of stationary stars. 

At four-tenths of a light-year 
from the star, the activated com- 
puter and its backup agreed that a 
yellow-brown patch of dim light 
near the white star was a planet. 
Higher functions of the computers 
felt the prickly stirrings of life and 
were informed of the discovery. A 
background library of planetary 
theory was consulted. The blurred 



disk shimmered as the ship swept 
through a whisper-thin cloud of 
dust while the machines bracketed 
and measured their objective in 
methodical detail. 

The planet was large. It might 
have enough mass to ignite thermo- 
nuclear fires in its core, but ex- 
perience argued that its light was 
too dim. The computers pondered 
whether to classify the system as a 
binary star and eventually decided 
against it. Still, the waxing point 
of light ahead held promise. 

M ark gains came to work 
early, squinting through the 
smog layers of Pasadena at a 
watery fall sunrise. The day was 
already thickening the air with 
more of the ruddy-brown stuff — he 
slipped a filtering mask over his 
nose and mouth and found he could 
all but taste the cloying sweet smell 
it gave off. 

He switched on the car radio for 
the early morning news. Another 
major strike was brewing, threat- 
ening to cut off shipping and the 
airlines. The President had made 
a “tough, hard-hitting’’ speech 
against rioters — Federal funding 
for local law enforcement was 
going up. A large industrial coali- 
tion had linked up with the labor 
unions to back a bill granting 
extraordinary protectionist import 
taxes on Japanese products. Psy-

IF 




chologists were worrying about the 
sudden surge in infanticide— they 
thought it was probably related t^ 
crowding in the cities. 

Mark turned off the radio as he 
swung into the parking lot at the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He 
had been keeping vague track of the 
political situation and was not sur- 
prised to find it getting worse — it 
always did. The national adminis- 
tration was jittery, unable to deal 
with the slump in the economy and 
the irrational violence that cropped 
up everywhere. 

Well, he told himself, politics 
were not his problem. As usual, 
his was one of the first cars in the 
parking lot. He passed through the 
three sets of guards, grudgingly 
showed his badge — the Lab was a 
prime target for the bombers— and 
his steps echoed down deserted 
neon-lit corridors. But when he 
reached his office he found the lab 
director, Clyde Fixmer, already 
waiting. Mark moved a stack of 
journals out of a chair for Fixmer, 
pushed papers into a heap on his 
desk and raised the blinds on his 
window to let a pale blade/ of light 
lance across one wall. He adjusted 
the blinds every morning as a ritual 
beginning of work, and so uttered 
nothing more than a greeting to 
Fixmer until it was done. 

“Something wrong?” he asked 
then, summoning up an alertness 



he seldom felt at this hour. He was 
chief monitor for several space 
vehicles and any one of them could 
go wrong overnight. 

Clyde Fixmer grimaced and 
closed a folder he had been reading. 
“The Jupiter Viking,” he said 
tersely. He was a burly red-faced 
man with a smooth voice and a 
belly that had recently begun to 
curl down his business shirts to 
conceal his belt buckle. 

“Malfunction?” 

“No. It’s being jammed.” He 
flicked a glance at Mark. 

Mark raised an eyebrow. He 
might still be a little sleepy, but he 
wasn’t so slow that he could be 
taken in by an office gag. 

“Yeah, 1 know,” Fixmer said, 
sighing. “Sounds impossible. But it 
happened.” 

“How?” 

“At two this morning we got a 
diagnostic report from the Viking. 
The graveyard shift couldn’t figure 
it out, so they called me. Seemed 
like the onboard computer thought 
the main radio dish was having 
feedback problems.” He shook his 
head, took off his glasses to cradle 
them in his lap. “That wasn’t it, I 
decided. The dish is okay. But 
every time it tries to transmit to us, 
something echoes the signal back 
after two minutes.” 

“Echoes?” Mark swerved his 
chair, staring at titles on his book- 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT

shelves while he ran the circuit lay- 
out of the Viking's radio gear 
through his mind. **Two minutes is 
far too long for any feedback prob- 
lem— you're right. Unless the 
whole program has gone bad and 
the transmissions are being retaped 
by the Viking itself. It could get 
confused and think it was getting 
an incoming signal." 

Fixmer waved a hand impa- 
tiently. "We thought of that. The 
diagnostics say no — it just can't be 
that way. Everything checks out 
okay." 

"I give up," Mark said, spread- 
ing his hands and dropping them to 
the desk top. The gesture reminded 
him of his expansive Italian father 
— the thought irritated him. He 
felt faintly embarrassed by any- 
thing dramatic. "What is it, thenT' 

"1 think the Viking is getting an 
honest incoming signal. It's telling 
us the truth." 

Mark snorted. "Come off it. 
Radio waves take nearly an hour 
to reach us from Jupiter. How is 
anyone going to send the Viking's 
own messages back to it in two 
minutes?" 

"By putting a transmitter in 
orbit around Jupiter — one just 
like the Viking." 

Mark blinked. "The Russians? 
But they agreed—" 

"No Russians. We checked. 
They say no, they haven't shot 



anything out that way at all. And 
our intelligence people are sure 
they're leveling." 

"What do they think about the 
Chinese?" 

"No chance. They aren’t yet 
playing in our league." 

"Who, then?" 

Fixmer shrugged, the slight sag- 
ging lines of his face deepened by 
fatigue. "I was kind of thinking 
you might help me find out." 

There was a faint ring of defeat 
in the way the man said it — Mark 
noted the tone because he had never 
heard it before. Usually Fixmer 
had an aspect of brittle hardness, 
a cool superior air. Now his face 
was not set in its habitual aloof 
expression — it seemed open, even 
vulnerable. Mark guessed why the 
man had come in himself at two 
A.M. — to show his people, without 
having to tell them in so many 
words, that he could do the work 
himself, that he had not lost the 
touch, that he understood the twists 
and subtleties of the machines they 
guided. But Clyde Fixmer had not 
unraveled the knot and the grave- 
yard shift had departed, so now he 
could safely ask for help. The puz- 
zle was still unbroken but at least 
Fixmer knew more than Mark and 
that still was something — it gave 
Fixmer an edge. ' 

Mark smiled wryly at the game. 
"Sure," he said. "I’ll help.’’

IF 




AROUND every star stretches a 
jHL spherical shell of space 
and within the thickness of that 
shell, temperatures on the surfaces 
of planets do not range to extremes 
of heat or cold that would preclude 
life. The shell, of course, is that 
theoretical entity called the 
ecosphere. 

One-third of a light-year from the 
fiercely burning sun, the craft sur- 
veyed the ecosphere and found it 
good. There was no sign of a large 
planet like the yellow-brown gas 
giant circling farther out. This was 
a crucial test, for a massive world in 
the middle of the ecosphere would 
have rendered unstable other orbits 
within the life-giving volume. Had 
the ship found such a planet, it was 
under standing orders— orders so 
old that they functioned as instincts 
—to accelerate through the system, 
gathering all possible data for the 
astrophysical index, and chart a 
course for the next in a lengthy 
record of candidate suns. 

Instead the ship continued to de- 
celerate. Its telescope emerged 
more frequently and peered ahead 
for the longer intervals. Another 
gas giant was resolved from a blue- 
white splotch — this planet was 
smaller than the first and farther 
from the star. Its image resisted 
precision. The craft noted a blurred 
circlet of light and speculated that 
the body might have rings, a not 



uncommon occurrence among 
heavy planets. 

Another massive planet was 
discovered, then another. They 
formed a string leading away from 
the ecosphere. The machines began 
to lower their estimates of the 
possibility of life in this system. 
Still, past experience held out a 
glimmer of hope. Small dim worlds 
might lie within the ecosphere. By 
fluke the ship could be approaching 
a fertile world from the night side 
and miss it entirely. The craft 
waited and watched. 

At one-sixth of a light-year out 
the computers were rewarded. A 
planet did lie within the ecosphere, 
its image an ambiguous smear of 
blue and brown and white. 

The machines felt a spasm of 
relief and joy, a seething electric 
surge within. They were sophisti- 
cated devices — webs of impulses 
programed to want to succeed, yet 
buffered against severe disappoint- 
ment if success eluded them. 

For the moment they were— if 
the word quite applies — content. 
The ship flew on. 

M ark gains spent most of 
the morning arguing with 
flight control engineers. Neither he 
nor Clyde Fixmer were willing 
totally to abandon the hypothesis 
that the Jupiter Orbital Viking — 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



9 




JOV, coyly enough, lacking only an 
£— had malfunctioned. The en- 
gineers thought otherwise. They 
debated earnestly, pitting sweet 
cool reason against vague doubts. 
After several hours of diagnostic 
analysis and the clicking and bur- 
ring of calculators, a complete 
run-through of the Viking’s error- 
detection systems— and more— the 
two men gave in. There was no 
mechanical flaw. 

The mysterious echo had faded 
away a little after three a.m. The 
Viking was no longer simply cir- 
cling Jupiter — a month earlier its 
engines had been stirred awake and 
made to nudge it into orbit around 
Callisto, fifth moon of Jupiter. 
Now it spun an elaborate orange- 
slice orbit, lacing over the icy glare 
of Callisto’s poles every eight 
hours. 

Mark snapped a cracker in 
half, swallowed it with some steam- 
ing tea, sweet and acrid mingling. 
He closed his eyes lo the ting and 
clatter of telemetry. He thought. 

Suddenly he snapped his fingers. 
“That’s it! If the signal came 
from a source near Jupiter, the 
echo must have faded because 
Callisto came between the two.” 

Fixmer nodded. “Quite reason- 
able. I thought of the same thing.” 
He looked at his watch. “It’s al- 
most noon. Why didn’t the echo 
return around seven this morning 



when the Viking came out from 
behind Callisto?” 

Mark had the uncomfortable 
feeling that he was playing the role 
of dull-witted graduate student to 
Fixmer’s learned professor. 

“Well — maybe the other source 
is occluded by Jupiter itself.” 
Fixmer pursed his lips. “Maybe, 
maybe,” he said, without giving a 
hint of whether the idea had pre- 
viously occurred to him as well. 

“Can’t we rough out some sort 
of orbit for the source, given that 
much information?” 

Fixmer nodded. But both men 
were starving. The calculation 
waited until after a quick lunch. 
Then, starting with the position of 
the Viking’s main dish when the 
echo had begun, and adding a few 
armwaving arguments about the 
most probable orbital parameters 
a probe would attempt, they com- 
puted when it would move into view 
from the Viking again. Spherical 
trigonometry, calculus, angles, 
estimates — the answer was around 
3:30 P.M., an hour away. 

“Can we realign the Viking’s 
main dish in one h,our?” 

“We’ll have to,” Fixmer said 
firmly. He was already picking 
up the telephone to call Operations 
Conrol. 

“Tell them to rotate the camera 
platform, too,” Mark said 
suddenly. 



10 



IF 




“You think there’ll be anything 
to see at that range?” 

Mark shrugged. “Could be.” 
“The narrow-angle camera?” 
“Right. With filters ready to 
sequence automatically.” 

Fixmer spoke rapidly and pre- 
cisely into the telephone, smiling 
confidently now that there were 
orders to be given, men to be told. 

T he ship was still cruising in 
deep silence, far from the star’s 
healing warmth, when it began to 
discern radio waves. More of the 
higher functions of the craft came 
to life. The weak signals were 
weighed and sifted. 

After the usual sputtering noise 
of the star had been filtered away 
a faint trace of emission from the 
planets was detected. 

The largest source was the world 
the computers had found before, 
the innermost gas giant. This was 
an optimistic sign, for the planet 
did orbit near the ecosphere. The 
ship drew the boundary for the 
ecosphere under the assumption 
that interesting planets had trans- 
parent atmospheres, but this was 
only a convenience. Gas giants had 
thick, deep atmospheres that boiled 
and streamed. They could warm 
themselves by gravitational con- 
traction and by heat-trapping— the 
greenhouse effect. Life could well 
evolve in their skies and seas. 



But such clotted blankets of gas 
and liquid meant awesome pres- 
sures. Life there rarely developed 
skeletons and thus could not ma- 
nipulate tools. The ship’s log car- 
ried many instances of this. And 
although gas giants might be pop- 
ulated, their inhabitants could not 
communicate because they had no 
technology— and the ship could 
assuredly not fly into such pres- 
sures in search of them. 

A smaller source of radio waves 
lay farther inside the ecosphere. It 
was the third planet, blue and 
white. The signals were too faint 
for the ship to discern meaningful 
patterns, so they might well arise 
from atmospheric phenomena— 
thunderstorms and lightning flashes 
or perhaps radiation from a mag- 
netosphere. Still, the world had an 
atmosphere, a hopeful sign. The 
craft flew sunward. 

II 

B y six P.M. the two men gave 
'up. The Viking’s main dish had 
been reprogramed to carry out a 
search pattern around the spot 
where the unknown radio source 
should appear. It was functioning. 
The data were coming in. All oper- 
ations were proceeding smoothly. 
And there were absolutely no 
results. 

The “target”— so the engineers 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



11 




called it — should have reappeared 
at 3:37 p.m. according to revised 
estimates. Given the time lag in 
radio transmissions from Jupiter, 
Operations Control began receiv- 
ing data slightly before 4:30 p.m. 
The main dish’s search was com- 
pleted within an hour. The narrow 
angle camera was not used — not 
enough technicians were free 
from monitoring other planetary 
satellites— and in any case, nothing 
indicated there was anything to see. 

“Well, there’s one good idea gone 
bad,” Fixmer said, getting up 
from the monitoring console and 
pacing around in the aisle. “Either 
the whole thing is a pipe dream — ” 
“Or we haven’t got the orbit 
right,” Mark said. 

“Yeah, there’s always that.” 
“We can have another look 
tomorrow.” 

“Sure.” Fixmer did not sound 
particularly enthusiastic. Ignoring 
the background murmur of the 
Operations Control bay, Fixmer 
paced some more and finally sat 
down again. The pair studied 
their green television screens, where 
sequencing and programing data 
were being continually displayed 
and erased. 

“Look, I might as well try the 
camera,” Mark said. 

“What’s the use?” 

“Call it idle speculation.” He 
was feeling tired and depressed 



and he wasn’t looking for an argu- 
ment. His wife had already called 
with the information that dinner 
was going to be hopelessly ruined. 
And the afternoon’s mail had 
brought notice that the Internal 
Revenue Service was auditing his 
tax return for the previous year, 
1990. 

“Okay, try it.” Fixmer threw 
down his pencil and got up. His 
white shirt was folded and wrinkled. 
In defeat he seemed more human to 
Mark, less an edgy executive 
carefully measuring his moves 
before he made them. “See you 
tomorrow,” Fixmer said and 
turned away, shoulders slumped. 

Mark shrugged at the console 
and began typing instructions. 

B y the time the craft entered 
the system it had a clear idea 
of the planetary population. There 
were nine planets in all, with 
perhaps a few more very near the 
star or very far from it — they did 
not matter, since obviously they 
would be inhospitable to life. Of 
the nine, four h^ld promise. There 
was a completely clouded world 
near the inner boundary of the 
ecosphere. Next was the smaller 
radio-emitter— it showed clear 
oxygen lines and seemed to have 
oceans. A smaller world came 
next, dry and cold but with inter- 
esting markings. 



12 



IF 




But the craft’s attention focused 
on the fourth possibility, the huge 
banded giant. Its radio emissions 
were random in frequency yet 
seemed keyed to an amplitude 
pattern that repeated nearly iden- 
tically at a constant period. 

The ship made a minor change 
in course. Gas giant or no, the radio 
pattern could not be ignored. It 
moved into the ecliptic plane and 
swung smoothly toward the great 
planet. 

U \j[T^ DIDN’T see it because 
Wf it was altering course,” 
Mark said. Eighteen hours had 
passed and the optical and spectro- 
scopic analyses from the Viking 
were in finished form — telemetry 
errors corrected— yellow squiggles 
on green tape. 

“It gives off all the lines of a 
fusion torch burning pretty 
bright. At least six thousand 
degrees. The Viking got one clear 
look at it before Callisto got in the 
way again.” He slid a glossy photo 
across Fixmer’s desk. 

“Not much to see,” Fixmer said. 
The photo showed a tiny splotch 
against a black background. “And 
this was through the onboard 
telescope? Must be pretty far 
away.” 

“It is — or was. Almost all the 
way across the Callisto orbit. I 
don’t think we’ll be able to spot it 



again on the next pass, however.” 
“Any radio contact?” 

“Nope. No time. And I couldn’t 
get a good enough fix on it from 
that photo for a narrow radio 
beam like the one the main dish 
puts out.” 

There was a silence. 

“You know, Mark, this is going 
to be pretty big news.” 

“It sure will.” 

“I think we ought to sit on it 
until 1 get a chance to speak to the 
director.” Fixmer looked at him 
steadily. “There’s not much ques- 
tion about what this thing is.” 

“It’s not one of ours, if that’s 
what you mean.” 

“Nor the Russians’. It’s not from 
this planet.” 

“That’s what I figured, but I 
didn’t want to say it. Seems 
pretty wild.” 

Fixmer frowned. “Too wild, 
maybe. I hate to think what those 
religious fanatics are going to stir 
up about it. Or what the military 
will think. We don’t know if that 
thing is peaceful, you know.” 

Mark looked irritated. He always 
did when political matters inter- 
fered with his work. “Listen,” he 
said, “hadn’t we better figure out 
where it’s going before we worry 
about what to do if it gets here?” 

T he gas giant had been a dis- 
appointment. The nonrandom 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



13 




radio emissions were natural in 
origin, keyed to the orbital period 
of its tiny, reddish inner satellite. 
Methodically the craft analyzed 
the larger moons and found only 
ammonia ice fields. 

Its usual method of search was 
totally dependent . on monitoring 
radio signals. It was far easier to 
seek correlations among the back- 
ground noise than it would have 
been to transmit tight, simply 
coded messages to any likely 
candidate planets in the system. So 
the ship had listened patiently, 
circling the huge planet. Nothing 
of interest had been received. The 
craft’s programs did not allow for 
long stays in the vicinity of planets 
as large as this. A multitude of 
captured rocks and much dust 
circled the gas giant, making ac- 
cidental collisions with the ship 
quite probable. Safety demanded 
that it not remain long. 

The craft accelerated and moved 
out of the orbital plane. It set 
course for its next destination. 

But as it did so a brief burst of 
radio signal caught its attention. 
The signal showed high correla- 
tions — though not enough to rule 
out a natural origin. There were 
many well-ordered phenomena in 
nature. 

Nevertheless, following standing 
orders, the ship retransmitted the 
same electromagnetic signal back 



toward the source. This happened 
several times, quite quickly, but no 
sign came from the source that 
the ship’s transmission had been 
received. Then, abruptly, the signal 
stopped. 

The ship pondered. The signal 
might well have had a natural 
cause, particularly in view of the 
intense magnetic fields surrounding 
the giant gas planet. Yet without 
further investigation there was no 
way to decide. 

The source could be the fifth 
moon, a cold and barren world. 
The ship was aware that this moon 
was tide-locked to the gas giant, 
keeping the same side eternally 
facing inward. Its revolution with 
respect to the ship was therefore 
rather slow. It seemed unlikely 
that the source of the radiation 
would have slipped below the 
visible edge so quickly. 

Too, the signal strength was low, 
though not so weak that the ship 
could not have detected it before. 
Perhaps it was another radiation 
pattern from the belts of trapped 
electrons around the planet, 
triggered by the fifth moon rather 
than the first. 

The ship thought and decided. 
The hypothesis of natural origin 
seemed by far the most likely. It 
would cost fuel and time to check 
further and the region near the gas 
giant was dangerous. Far wiser.

then, to continue accelerating. 

It filed the information and 
moved sunward. 

ii'^T'OU’RE damned right I 
X object to it,” Mark Cains 

said. 

“Look, Mark, I sympathize 
with you completely. We’re scien- 
tists. We don’t like this secrecy 
business.” Fixmer chose his words 
carefully. “But at the same time I 
can understand the need for tight 
security in this matter. If you—” 

“For how long?” Mark asked 
sharply. 

“Long?” Fixmer hesitated, the 
rhythm of his prepared speech 
broken. “I don’t really know,” he 
said lamely. “Perhaps for the 
indefinite future. The President 
didn’t say.” His voice took on a 
hardness. 

“Does the President think 
anybody can suppress news about 
something this big forever? It’s 
been four months now. I don’t 
think all the men who know about 
the Marauder are going to keep 
quiet much longer.” 

Fixmer casually leaned back in 
his chair and studied Mark across 
the desk. “You aren’t hinting that 
you might — ” 

“Hell, no. I’m not going to spill 
it. But the whole idea is stupid.” 

“You wouldn’t feel that way if 
you had been with me at the 



White House, Mark,” Fixmer 
said solemnly. 

“I wasn’t invited.” 

“I know. I understand NASA 
wanted to keep down the number 
present for security reasons.” The 
trip had been the high point of 
Fixmer’s career and Mark sus- 
pected he burned to tell someone 
about it. But only Mark and the 
director of the laboratory were 
privy to the information and the 
director had been present at the 
White House. Mark had listened 
to the full story without comment 
until now. 

“The way the President put it, 
Mark, was quite convincing. You 
know the political situation. We 
haven’t licked the Depression yet, 
really. And those religious fanatics, 
those Agents of God or whatever—” 
“New Sons of God.” 

“Yes. Those lunatics have al- 
ready got a U.S. Senator to speak 
for them. They could kick up a 
lot of dust. Plus the fact that the 
military people are pretty nervous 
about this thing.” 

“That’s ridiculous. No species 
from another star is going to come 
all this way to drop a bomb on us.” 
“You know that. I know that. 
But some of the generals are 
worried.” 

“Men with limited imaginations.” 
“Maybe.” Fixmer turned in his 
swivel chair and gazed out at a pale 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



15 




yellow February morning. “There 
is one factor that doesn’t require 
imagination, though. The elections 
are on and the President is facing 
some stiff opposition. He didn't 
do too well in New Hampshire, you 
know.” 

Both men stared moodily at the 
eucalyptus tree that dripped 
steadily in the light gray fog out- 
side the window. Fixmer tapped his 
pen on the metal desk and the 
rhythm echoed hollowly in the still 
room. 

“I still think we have an obliga- 
tion to tell the rest of the human 
race about this. It’s not just another 
strategic element for the Joint 
Chiefs to figure, out,” Mark said. 

“I’m sorry you feel that way, 
Mark.” 

Mark made no reply. Outside, 
drops pattered soundlessly in a 
moist, chilled world. 

“You do acknowledge the need 
for secrecy in this, don’t you? 1 
mean, you will maintain security 
despite your personal feelings? I 
would — 

“Yes, yes. I’ll go along,” Mark 
said testily. 

“Good, very good. Otherwise 
1 would have to remove you from 
the group. Nothing personal, of — ” 

“Yeah, I know. That’s the only 
reason I agree, so that I can stay.” 
Mark got up to leave, smiling 
grimly to himself. 



“Well, speaking for myself. 
I’m happy that you’re staying. 
NASA doesn’t want any new 
personnel brought in on this if we 
can avoid it, and it’s going to take 
a lot of work to find out what 
happened to that thing.” 

“The Marauder,"' Mark said. 

“Uh, yes. About that. There was 
a little concern about attaching 
such a dramatic name to it. Might 
excite interest, you know, if anyone 
should run across it accidentally. 
The Vice President suggested we 
give it a number — J-Fifteen. With 
fourteen Jovian moons discovered, 
this is another. 

“Um.” Mark shrugged. 

“But the main interest, of course, 
lies in finding out where we can 
expect it next.” 

“I think I already know,” Mark 
said, pacing up and down the 
room, now lost in thought, his 
humorless smile gone. 

“Oh?” 

“It headed for Mars. I’m pretty 
sure of that from the Doppler 
shift measurement of the fusion 
flame. Jupiter amd Mars are set 
for a good configuration now and 
the Marauder s velocity was 
adquate to get it to Mars early 
this month. I can’t be sure, of 
course, without knowing more 
about the Marauder s capability — 
and whether it accelerates through- 
out the whole voyage — but I think 



16 



IF 




my conclusion is a good bel.” 

“It's near Mars, then?” Fixmer 
leaned forward, his administrator’s 
manner forgotten. 

“N 9 t any more.” 

“I don’t get it.” 

“While you were back east 1 got 
time on the Mars Or biters. Their 
camera and telescope rigs are just 
as good as the Jupiter Viking’s and 
—remember that blanket budget 
you gave me last month? I carried 
out a search for the Marauder s 
fusion flame. Last night I found 
it.” 

“What?” Fixmer stood up. “You 
should have told me.” 

“I am telling you.” 

“You should have said something 
earlier!” 

Fixmer hitched up his belt and 
drew in his stomach, not looking 
directly at Mark. Mark guessed 
that Fixmer was uncomfortably 
aware that he had rushed into 
the Washington story without 
giving Mark chance to say any- 
thing. Mark stopped his pacing and 
stood with .arms folded, a faint 
sour taste in his mouth. 

“I’ll have to inform NASA and 
the Joint Chiefs of this. If the object 
is in orbit around Mars now — ” 

“It isn’t,” Mark said, unfolding 
his arms and relaxing. 

“I thought you identified the 
spectrograph lines of its flame,” 
“I did. But the Marauder was 



outward bound, away from Mars. 
The flight path was pretty clear. 
I think it must have done a gravita- 
tional rebound, just looping in for 
a quick look and picking up 
momentum from the encounter, 
like the Grand Tour probes.” 

Mark leaned against the wall 
of Fixmer’s office; not caring that 
his blue sweater caught drifting 
swirls of yellow chalk dust from the 
nearby blackboard. He was glad 
for once to have Fixmer on the 
defensive. Perhaps that way the 
man could be deflected from his 
fascination for generals and 
presidents. 

Fixmer looked puzzled. “Where 
is it going next? This could be of 
crucial importance. I’ll have to call 
Washington right away.” He 
licked his lips. “Yes, right away.” 
He looked at Mark. “Well, what 
can I tell them? Any idea where 
it will go?” 

“Venus,” Mark said. 

T he ship had known even 
before leaving the banded gas 
giant that the next world inward 
was barren. Meanwhile the blue- 
and-white world demanded most 
of the craft’s attention. It satisfied 
all requirements for life. More, 
radio noise from it carried a clear 
non-random component. There 
were many signals. Translation 
proceeded slowly. But as the craft 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



17 




neared the dry fourth " planet it 
reached a verdict: the third world 
held life that used radio. 

A debate ensued within the ship. 

Matters of judgment were being 
decided by vote among three 
equally able computers until 
intelligent life was found — then 
the highest elements of the craft 
would be warmed into life. 

One of the computers held out 
for an immediate change of orbit, 
to skip the dry world and drive on 
to the radio-emitter. One other felt 
that the second planet, shrouded 
in thick, creamy clouds, might well 
support intelligent life— indeed, 
past experience made the hypothe- 
sis quite probable. And in any case, 
was it not a better idea to arrive at 
the blue world with as much in- 
formation about this solar system 
as possible? 

The third computer wavered for 
a moment, then cast its vote with 
the second. It also pointed out that 
a survey of the inner clouded 
planet would leave more time for 
decoding the signals from the third 
world, so that a better approach 
could be made. 

The decision was hurried, since 
the parched red disk ahead was 
growing quickly. Here and there on 
its surface a blotch of color 
promised a thin, moist refuge for 
life, but most of the world was dead 
hills of drifting dust. The ship 



completed its transit in a few hours, 
storing the collected data on tiny 
magnetic grains before turning 
back to the inner planets. 

The craft damped the rumble of 
its bright flame and began the 
long glide toward the brilliant white 
world, but its electromagnetic ears 
strained to catch whispers from 
the other. The signals from it were 
scrambled— and learning a lan- 
guage without common referents is 
a task that must take time. 

The machines set to work eagerly. 

Ill 

HERE it is,” Mark said. 

X The small cluster of men 
around his console leaned forward. 
On the television screen in front 
of them a telemetered photograph 
was being drawn, line by line. At 
the top edge of the screen was a 
tiny point of light, scarcely more 
than a few dots on the picture tube. 

“You’re sure?” a man from 
NASA said. 

“It’s not a star,” Mark said, 
“and it wasn’t there on the last 
pass this particular Orbiter made. 
I think it’s the Marauder,** 

“J-Fifteen,” Fixmer said. 

“Wait a minute — the spectro- 
graphic readings are coming in,” 
Mark said. A line of data was 
printed out, overlaying the photo. 
The men read it intently. Most of 



18 



IF 




them were unable to make any 
sense of it, since the information 
was a coded transcript of spectral 
intensity versus wavelength and 
few of the men had enough training 
even to know what to expect. 

“Looks complicated,” one of 
them muttered. 

“That clinches it,” Mark said 
tensely. “It’s pretty hot— must be 
the fusion flame,” 

There was a moment of silence. 
Then one of the men asked, 
“There’s no chance of error?” 
“I don’t think so,” Mark said. 
Fixmer said, “He’s right.” 
“Then, gentlemen, I think we 
must start preparing. That thing 
will come here next. We must be 
ready for it.” The man wore 
civilian clothes, but held himself 
stiffly erect and had the air of 
one whose orders are followed. 
There were several others like him 
in the party. They nodded in 
agreement. 

“Precisely what do you mean?” 
Mark asked evenly. 

“Mr. Cains,” the man said 
blandly, “I take it you people feel 
this J-Fifteen thing is searching 
for life. It has reached Venus. It’s 
going to have to come here. But 
we don’t know what it might try to 
do. It may try to land, bringing 
unknown diseases with it. The 
military will have to stop such an 
attempt.” 



Mark ignored Fixmer’s raised 
finger plainly telling him to remain 
silent. 

“How?” 

“Well, we surely cannot allow 
it to approach in too close an 
orbit—” 

“And how close is that?” 

“That is something I’m afraid we 
will have to determine for our- 
selves,” the man said coldly. 
“Meanwhile—” he turned to the 
rest of the group— “I think the 
President should be informed. This 
area is not secure for further dis- 
cussions in any case. 1 suggest we 
retire upstairs.” 

“I’ll stay here,” Mark said. 
“We have to find out if it’s going 
to orbit Venus or just fly by.” 

“Agreed— ni stand by, too,” 
Fixmer said nervously. He looked 
at the military man. “If it is just 
the same to you, sir—” 

“Very well,” the man said. 
“This way, gentlemen.” The 
group left. They moved with a 
heavy, calm assurance. 

Mark was already absorbed in 
the incoming data displayed on his 
screen. This section of the Opera- 
tions Control bay was now sealed 
off with plywood walls and the 
consoles around him were manned 
by men who knew only enough for 
them to do their jobs. 

He found it difficult to separate 
in his mind the tension of the “J- 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



19 




15 Project,” as it was officially 
called, from the political turmoil 
he knew was scourging the world 
outside. It was late August and 
the primaries were going badly. 
One of the major parties had 
broken into angry factions, some 
of them violent. The President was 
being heavily guarded. The New 
Sons of God had gotten wind of 
something strange taking place in 
NASA and were already preach- 
ing sermons about dire happen- 
ings in space. They knew nothing 
concrete, but Mark had some 
premonition of what would hap- 
pen if the Marauder orbited Earth 
— then it would be impossible to 
conceal the truth. An amateur with 
a telescope would be able to see 
the ship. 

And now the Joint Chiefs had 
come into the picture. 

Mark donned his microphone at- 
tachment. He spoke quickly into 
it, ordering control of the remain- 
ing Venus Orbiters — three of them 
— over to his board. 

“What are you doing?” Fixmer 
asked, bending over to look at the 
screen. 

“Trying to keep the Marauder 
in sight,” Mark said. 

“Do you think it is going to 
orbit?” 

Mark shook his head. “No way 
to tell.” Around them the techni- 
cians and engineers were hunched 



over their consoles. Every in- 
struction that came from Mark’s 
board had to be interpreted and 
checked by them to insure that 
nothing disastrous was done to the 
Venus Orbiters by accident. The 
tandem arrangement had been 
specially rigged for this moment. 
Mark was sure that by now some 
of them must be beginning to sus- 
pect the truth. 

In a few moments his calcula- 
tions were complete. Mark nar- 
rowed his attention to Venus 
Orbiter II, which was just begin- 
ning to sense the Marauder s fu- 
sion image over the Venusian 
horizon. He took control of the 
Orbiter’s main radio dish and gave 
it new coordinates for aiming. 

Abruptly, the main signal from 
the Orbiter stopped. The diag- 
nostic signal remained, since it 
came from the smaller dish. It 
was a blur of stuttered tenor 
squeals. 

“What is going on?” Fixmer 
wanted to know. 

“Hold on a minute,” Mark said. 

He waited until the dish plat- 
form was locked on the Marauder s 
coordinates. Fixmer was peering 
at him, unable to understand 
what was happening. 

Mark checked to be sure the line 
was open. Then, methodically, he 
began to tap out a series of dots 
and dashes. 



20 



IF 




T he ship was braking smoothly, 
preparing to enter an elliptical 
orbit, when the strong radio pulse 
found it. 

The pattern was simple and 
obvious: on, off, on on, off, on on 
on, off — the sender was counting 
out the numbers. A grouping of 
pulses that might be a rudimentary 
alphabet followed. 

The ship immediately returned 
the signal. There was an instant re- 
sponse — the same pattern started 
over again, this time a little faster. 

That was enough. The ship 
quickly located the source of the 
signal — it was circling the planet 
not far above the atmosphere. One 
of the ship’s computers had 
theorized that the cloud deck was 
too thick and too heavily ionized 
at the top to allow radio waves to 
escape — this hypothesis seemed 
confirmed by the circling satellite, 
which clearly resembled a beacon 
for approaching spacecraft. The 
ship recalled a similar instance 
from an earlier contact with an 
amphibian race whose world, too, 
had been heavily clouded and 
whose inability to see the stars had 
retarded its ventures into space 
for many centuries. 

The three deciding computers 
voted unanimously to alter the 
craft’s orbit and approach the 
beacon satellite. The question of 
whether this planet was inhabited 



could be settled later. The overrid- 
ing fact was that the ship had been 
signaled and answered and that an 
elementary interchange was taking 
place. 

The craft computed a new 
course and executed it even as it 
continued conversation with the 
satellite. It began storing electrical 
power for the day when it would 
have learned enough about this 
new race— then it would trans- 
mit a powerful pulse back to a 
distant relay point, back to who- 
ever so long ago had built it. After 
that events were up to intelligences 
greater than its own. 

For the moment the machines 
felt a surge of anticipation. The 
contact just beginning would again 
call forth their most subtle 
faculties. Their higher functions 
would be revived. They would be- 
come immersed in elaborate chains 
of deduction and inference — the 
experience would be quite 
pleasurable. 

ii you crazy?” Fixmer 

asked loudly. He reached 
for the switches on Mark’s console. 
Mark blocked his arm. 

“Don’t try it,” he said carefully. 

“You are taking action in a mat- 
ter of national security without 
consulting — ” 

“I’m saving our necks, is what 
you mean. The Marauder has al- 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



21 




ready changed course slightly. It’s 
going to stay near Venus for a 
while at least. And it’s answering 
my code.” 

Fixmer clenched his fists. He 
did not know whether to try to 
stop Mark or not, but as he thought 
it over he realized that the job 
would not be easy. Mark was big 
and, ben^th his calm manner, 
coldly resolved. 

Fixmer shifted his weight slightly. 
Mark stood up and pushed his chair 
away, blocking the console with his 
body. Fixmer noticed that the 
technicians around them were 
staring, not knowing what to make 
of the two tense men. He felt 
slightly ridiculous. He realized 
that his hands were clenched and 
deliberately he relaxed them. He 
took a step back. 

“Okay. You’ve done the damage 
by now, anyway. I’ll let the au- 
thorities deal with you.” 

“I’m sure you will.” 

“I don’t know what you think 
you’re doing.” 

“Keeping the Marauder away 
from Earth and where the lunatics 
can’t get at it. If we can keep it 
thinking that Venus is inhabited 
and that the radio messages are 
originating from its surface— 
inaybe it won’t come here. Maybe 
we can convince it that Earth is 
just a colony.” 

Fixmer stared at Mark for a 



moment, then turned abruptly and 
picked up the nearest telephone. He 
dialed four digits and said, “Cap- 
tain? Fixmer. I want two security 
men down here on the double. 
That’s right, main bay. Security 
violation. Bad one. I think- 
okay.” 

He hung up and looked at Mark. 
He shook his head. “I don’t under- 
stand you, Mark. You’ve always 
seemed a responsible man, level- 
headed. Making decisions about 
this matter — ” he glanced around 
at the engineers and raised his 
voice — “isn’t your responsibility. 
You—” 

“I guess I feel I have higher 
responsibilities than you recog- 
nize,” Mark said quietly. 

“Bull. You—’.’ 

But Mark did not appear to hear 
what Fixmer was saying. He looked 
back at his console, thinking. And 
after Fixmer had run down Mark 
said slowly, “You know, there’s 
something I didn’t figure when I 
planned this. Suppose the Ma~ 
rauder sends all that phony infor- 
mation back to whoever sent it? 
They’ll come here looking for 
creatures who can inhabit a desert 
planet — seven hundred degrees 
at the surface— with only carbon 
dioxide to breathe.” 

“What of it?” Fixmer said 
sharply. He was watching the 
doors, waiting for the security

IF 




officers. His right foot tapped 
nervously. 

“We’ll seem like pretty fierce 
creatures, won’t we? Dragons. Our 
visitors would come armed to the 
teeth — if they have teeth— and 
ready for anything. And judging 
from that general I saw—” he 
gestured contemptuously— “they 
had better be lucky.” 

“You are stupid, Cains, just 
stupid,” Fixmer said viciously. 
“You’re living in your own air- 
tight world. Just what did you hope 
to gain by this little gesture?” 
“Time.” 

“That’s ridicu— ” 

“Time to think. Somebody has 
to figure out a way to put sense 
into this dinosaur agency. The 
people in charge are simply run- 
ning on adrenalin. Knee-jerk re- 
sponses aren’t going to work — 
not when you’re dealing with 
something totally unknown like the 
Marauder. This situation calls for 
intelligent thought, time and luck.” 
A door at the back of , the bay 
opened and two men with hard 
faces came in, looking quickly 
around. They wore sidearms. 

Mark ignored them. “Yeah, 
luck. I agree we’ll need luck.” 

IV 

M r. ICHINO paused at the 
entrance to the Pit. The 



calm murmur of technicians con- 
versing mingled with the ping and 
chatter of typewriter inputs. The 
Pit was dark. Its air was stale. 
Hooded consoles made pools 
of light where men sat monitoring, 
checking, editing the river of 
information that flowed from this 
room, converting it into the 
dancing rhythms of electrons riding 
electromagnetic wings to the 
Marauder. 

He noted a wall clock. He h;id 
twenty minutes before the meeting. 
Mr. Ichino sighed, willing him- 
self to relax and not think of what 
lay ahead. He clasped his hands 
behind him and walked slowly into 
the Pit, letting his eyes accustom 
themselves to the gloom. He 
paused at his personal console, 
froze a scrap of the transmission 
and read: 



In the service of the Emperor 
he found life and fought the 
barbarians and beat them into 
submission. When the Emperor 
so commanded he fought 
strange and evil fairy creatures 
and these he conquered. 
Dragons he slew, and giants. 
He was willing to do battle with 
all enemies of the land, mortal 
or animal or creatures from 
another world. And he was 
always the victor. 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



23 




He recognized the passage from 
the Japanese legend of K intaro, 
even in this westernized form. The 
Marauder had asked Mr. Ichino 
several days before for more of the 
ancient literature of Japan and he 
had brought in all the texts and 
translations he could find in his 
collection. They were being 
transmitted when time allowed. 
Mr. Ichino wondered idly if this 
had been selected especially by 
a programer, since it contained 
reference to “creatures from 
another world." Such an action 
would be lamentably typical— most 
of the men here understood nothing 
of what the Marauder wished to 
know. 

Mr. Ichino tapped his front 
teeth with a finger, thinking. The 
square, stylized yellow type 
squatted against the green of the 
tube, a strange and alien medium 
for the delicate thread of a fairy 
tale. He wondered how it would be 
read — was read, by now — by a 
thing of copper and germanium 
circling Venus. All this — the quiet 
intensity of the Pit, the compressed 
minutes he had lived through for 
months now, the unbalanced feel 
of what he was doing — seemed 
parts of a jumbled puzzle. If he 
had but a few days to sort it out, to 
fathom what kind of being could 
see so quickly to the core of Mr. 
Ichino's personal experience and 



extract it. But time was short. 

He moved on. A technician 
nodded. An engineer saluted 
silently. Word would spread that 
the old man was in the Pit for his 
daily visit — the men would be a 
trifle more alert. 

Mr. Ichino came to a large 
graphics tank and studied the 
intricate work being done inside 
it by the computer. He recognized 
the print at once: Nude in the 
Sunlight, Renoir, painted 1875 
or 1876. Mr. Ichino had selected 
the painting only two days before. 

Light filtered to a blue-green 
cast streaked across the breasts and 
arms of the naked girl, strangely 
altering the illuminating red glow 
of the skin that was Renoir’s un- 
mistakable signature. The girl 
gazed pensively downward, caught 
by the artist as she grasped some 
ill-defined cloth. Mr. Ichino looked 
at her for a long moment, savoring 
the ambiguity of her expression 
with a wistful romanticism he 
knew as an old friend. He had 
been a bachelor all his life. 

And what would the Marauder 
make of it? Mr. Ichino did not 
venture to guess. It had responded 
well to Luncheon of the Boating 
Party and asked for more— perhaps 
it mistook the painting for a sort 
of photograph, despite his explana- 
tion of the uses men niade of art. 

He shook his head as he watched 



24 



IF 




the computer carefully break down 
the picture into tiny squares of 
color. The Marauder spoke little - 
many of Mr. Ichino’s ideas about it 
were pure deduction. Still, there 
was something about the pattern of 
requests the Marauder made. 

“Anything you would like to see 
especially, sir?” a technician asked 
at his elbow. 

“No, no, everything seems to be 
going well,” Mr. Ichino said 
softly, startled out of his contem- 
plation. He waved the man away. 

O THER consoles flickered as 
the men in the Pit transmitted 
data to the Marauder. At the 
moment they were working their 
way through a fresh edition of an 
encyclopedia, he recalled. Simply 
radioing the material would have 
been simple, but the men he 
supervised were charged with edit- 
ing each line that found its way 
into code. The President had ac- 
cepted the recommendation of the 
Executive Committee that no 
detailed scientific or technical in- 
formation be given the Marauder — 
the Pit had been built to ensure it. 

Most of the consoles were operat- 
ing with Mr. Ichino’s own Code 4, 
a specially designed vocabulary 
and matrix of symbols that af- 
forded high information density 
in each transmission to the 
Marauder. The Executive Commit- 



tee had searched out Mr. Ichino 
in the days following the Cains 
incident, desperately trying to find 
a cryptologist who had enough 
experience with high flux signaling. 
Code 4 had been relatively simple 
to lay out, since it drew upon the 
codes Mr. Ichino had already 
developed for scrambled transmis- 
sions to Hipparchus Base. It was 
simple and flexible and seemed 
fairly secure from the Russians 
and Chinese and whoever else was 
listening in, but of course it had 
limited range. It soon became 
inadequate for the questions 
Marauder asked — photographs and 
a wider vocabulary were the only 
solution. And this was a problem. 

Because security was tight,^ many 
of the encoders and technicians 
had not been told about Marauder. 
They thought they were working on 
something related to Hipparchus 
Base on the moon. So it fell to 
Mr. Ichino himself to speak to the 
Marauder — and to another cryp- 
tologist, John Williams, who had 
been brought in to ease the strain. 
Mr. Ichino had little contact with 
him, since he managed the other 
half of their round-the-clock 
schedule. The Marauder never 
slept. 

But Williams would be at the 
meeting, Mr. Ichino reminded him- 
self. He stopped amid the comfort- 
ing buzz of the Pit and made a

quick survey of the remaining 
consoles. Images flickered there— 
a three-masted schooner in out- 
line, stiff figures modeling sixteenth 
century clothes, clouds layered 
over a boiling ocean. A river of 
information was being directed 
at the Marauder to correlate as it 
liked. 

He turned and made his way 
down a line of swivel chairs to the 
doorway, where he was passed in 
by a guard. As he emerged into a 
bright corridor he reached invol- 
untarily for the lump in his jacket 
pocket and brought it out— a 
rubbing stone. He kneaded it with 
his right hand, feeling the smooth 
cool textures and focusing on them, 
calming himself by lifelong habit. 

He walked. Mr. Ichino felt out of 
place in these garish corridors. 
He hated the plastiform walls, 
the thin partitions, clatter of 
typewriters, distant whisper of air- 
conditioning. He should be in a 
university by row, he thought, 
spending patient hours in a cloister 
far back in shadowed library 
stacks. He was aging — and the 
higher he rose the more abrasive 
the men he dealt with, the more 
subtle their methods of combat. 
He was not made for this game. 

But he played — he always had. 
For love of the crystalline mathe- 
matical puzzles he found in cryp- 
tography, for an avenue of 



escape— it had, after all, brought 
him from an immigrant family in 
small-town Oregon to Berkeley, 
to Washington and now, finally, 
to Houston. To meet the Marauder 
—and for this the journey had 
been worthwhile. 

He passed another guarxi and 
entered the conference room. No 
one was there— he was early. He 
padded softly over thick carpet to 
the table and sat down. Mr. 
Ichino’s notes were in order but he 
inspected them again, without 
focusing on the individual words. 
Secretaries came and went, placing 
yellow scratch pads and pens 
before each chair. An urn of coffee 
was wheeled in and set in a corner. 
A slight hollow pop disturbed Mr. 
Ichino’s meditations — someone was 
testing the pickup microphones 
spaced around the conference table. 

A SECRETARY gave him the 
agenda and he studied it. 
There was only a list of attendees 
and no hint of the meeting’s pur- 
pose. Mr. Ichino frowned as he 
read the names— there would be 
men and women here whom he 
knew only as figures in the news 
magazines. 

And all because of a vessel mil- 
lions of miles away. It seemed 
midly ironic, considering the im- 
mediate and serious problems of 
the administration in Washington.

IF 




But Mr. Ichino did not dwell on 
politics. His father had learned 
noninvolvement in Japan and 
had passed the lesson on. Mr. 
Ichino remembered his reluctance, 
while an adolescent, to join the 
poetry and language clubs in high 
school, because he had felt the 
sharing of the tenuous emotions 
these things brought him, the 
nuances they called up, could not 
be a public thing. To write about 
them, perhaps -that was possible. 
But how describe hikau except in 
another poem? Anything more — 
slabs of words, sentences of ex- 
planation without grace or lightness 
of touch— would be to crush the 
butterfly beneath a muddy boot. 

He had joined the Poetry Club 
finally out of sheer bravery— 
though not French Studies, the 
other possibility— and had found 
in it nothing to fear. Girls had 
read their stilted lines in high 
nervous voices and had sat down 
to approval, followed by mild 
criticism from the teacher/sponsor. 
Boys had spoken theirs hopefully— 
there had been only three boys 
in the club — and young Ichino 
had learned what he had hop>ed to 
— learned to speak before a peer 
group in his halting English, to 
define and explain and finally to 
disagree. 

That had been before mathema- 
tics, before the long years of con- 



centration at the university, before 
Washington and the dozens upon 
dozens of machine codes he had 
devised, the monographs on cryp- 
tography that had consumed his 
days and nights. 

‘‘Mr. Ichino, I’m George Evers,” 
a deep voice said. 

Mr. Ichino stood up quickly with 
a sudden release of unexpected 
nervous energy, murmured words 
of greeting and shook the man’s 
hand. 

Evers smiled thinly and regarded 
him with distant assessment. ‘‘I 
hope we’re not taking too much of 
your time today. You and Mr. 
Williams—” he nodded as 
Williams appeared and walked 
to the coffee urn, long legs moving 
awkwardly— “are our experts on 
the day-to-day behavior of the 
Marauder. We thought we should 
hear what you have to say before 
proceeding with the rest of the 
meeting.” 

“I see,” Mr. Ichino said, sur- 
prised to find his voice almost a 
whisper. “The letter I received 
yesterday gave me no details, so — ” 

“On purpose,” Evers said 
jovially, hitching thumbs into his 
belt. “We merely want to get an 
informal idea of what you think 
that thing is up to. The committee 
here — the Executive Committee, 
actually, that’s the President’s 
title for it — is faced with a dead- 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHHT

line and I'm afraid we're going to 
have to come to a decision right 
away, sooner than we thought." 

“Why?" Mr. Ichino asked, 
alarmed. “1 was under the impres- 
sion that there was no hurry." 

Mr. Evers paused, turned to wave 
to other men entering the long 
room. Mr. Ichino had the sudden 
impression of a man impatient to 
be off, to have the waiting finished, 
as though Evers knew the decision 
ahead and wanted to push on to 
the action that would follow. He 
noticed that Evers’s left hand, 
casually resting on the back of a 
chair, had a slight tremor. 

“That machine isn’t willing to. 
wait any more," Evers said, turning 
back. “It gave us the word two 
days ago." 

Before Mr. Ichino could reply, 
Evers nodded and moved away, 
clasping hands with the men in 
suits and pastel sports jackets who 
were filing into th^room. Williams, 
seated directly across the table, 
sent Mr. Ichino a questioning 
glance. 

M r. ichino shrugged elabor- 
ately, glad that he was able 
to appear so casual. He looked 
around. Some of the faces he re- 
cognized. None were as important 
as Evers, who bore the ambiguous 
title of Presidential Advisor. 
Evers moved to the head of the 



table, still talking to the men 
nearest him, and sat down. Others 
who had been standing took their 
places and the secretaries left the 
coffee urn to fend for itself. 

“Gentlemen," Evers said, 
calling them to order. “We will 
have to hurry things along, as you 
know, in order to meet the Presi- 
dent’s new deadline. I spoke with 
him this morning. He is very 
concerned and looks forward to 
reviewing the recommendations of 
this committee." Evers sat with his 
arms folded on the table before 
him, letting his eyes rove up and 
down the two lines of men. “You 
have all seen — excuse me, all but 
Mr. Williams and Mr. Ichino have 
seen — the messages received from 
the Marauder, requesting a change 
of venue." He paused for the 
ripple of polite laughter. “We are 
here to go into possible scenarios 
that could be initiated by the 
Marauder s arrival in near-Earth 
orbit." ^ 

He gestured toward Mr. Ichino. 

“These two gentlemen are guests 
of the Committee today and are 
here solely to bring us up to date 
on the nonessential information the 
division has been sending the 
Marauder. They are not, of course, 
members of the Exe.cutive Com- 
mittee itself." 

He smiled briefly at the two men 
and focused again on the ranks 



28 



IF 




aligned along the table, yellow 
pads scattered at random before 
them. A few were already taking 
notes. 

Evers sat back, relaxing. “Ever 
since the Cains incident, the 
Marauder has orbited Venus. 
I’m sure we all agree that it was 
regrettable that the story fed the 
Marauder — a civilization beneath 
the Venusian clouds and all that 
— was so obviously full of holes.” 
“It was never fooled,” a thin man 
said at Evers’s left. 

Eyes turned to him. Mr. Ichino' 
recognized him as a leading 
games theorist from the Hudson 
Institute. He wore poorly fitted 
tweeds and puffed an ornate pipe. 

“1 believe the Marauder has been 
studying us quite competently 
from where it is,” he said slowly. 
“Look at what it asks for from 
the division here — a welter of cul- 
tural information, photographs, 
things like that. No science or 
engineering. It can probably deduce 
that sort of thing, if it needs to, 
from radio and TV programs.” 
“Quite right,” a man farther 
down said. There were more assents. 

“Well, that may be,” Evers said, 
“but we are civilians and I think 
the military has an equally likely 
theory, This ship may not give a 
damn about our level of technology 
for the same reason we wouldn’t 
worry about the spears of South 



Sea natives when we wanted to use 
their island as a base.” 

“I’d worry,” said a man at the 
other end. “Those spears are 
sharp.” 

Evers smiled. “Well, we can 
cover these matters later. The 
point is that the Marauder wants 
to approach the Earth for a better 
study of our biosphere— or so it 
says. It promises to stay at a safe 
distance. It doesn’t buy the life- 
on-Venus story and following your 
earlier suggestion — ” he nodded 
toward the man in tweeds -“the 
President authorized me to 
transmit to the Marauder an 
admission that we did try to decieve 
it.” 

A low flurry of comment ran 
around the room, most of it 
favorable. Mr.* Ichino knew others 
had been negotiating with the 
Marauder, but these details were 
new. 

“After all,” Evers went on, “we 
may as well admit the obvious. I 
wrote the message myself— there 
was no time to consult this Com- 
mittee— and explained that at first 
we didn’t know whether the 
Marauder was friendly. I did not 
mention that we still don’t know.” 
He smiled. “The Marauder replied 
with a request to orbit Earth. 
Upon my advice the President 
proposed that the Marauder first 
orbit the moon for a while, so our 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



29 




men there can get a good look at 
it. A sort of mutual inspection." 

“What for?" the man in tweeds 
asked. “We could do the job better 
from Earth." 

“True," Evers said. He tapped a 
pencil on the table and Mr. 
Ichino could see that his Fingers 
trembled. “But there is an alter- 
native plan the Joint Chiefs have 
in mind. The plan works best if the 
Marauder pauses to orbit the 
moon. They regard it as highly 
suspicious that the Marauder says 
it knows nothing of its own origin. 
The Joint Chiefs feel that it may 
simply be learning all it can about 
us without risking itself by giving 
away potentially useful informa- 
tion. I can’t say anything more 
right now—" he glanced at Mr. 
Williams and Mr. Ichino and 
looked quickly away — “but I’ll 
bring it up later in the meeting. 
I’ll say only that the President 
thinks the plan has some merit." 

Mr. Ichino frowned. The Joint 
Chiefs? He tried to understand the 
implications of what Evers had 
said and lost track of the proceed- 
ings until: 

“—we’ll hear First from Mr. 
Ichino, who has shared the encod- 
ing and selection of information for 
the Marauder. Mr. Ichino?" 

H IS thoughts were a scramble. 
He said very carefully. 



“There is so much the Marauder 
wants to know. I have only begun 
to tell it about us. I am not by any 
means the best qualified—" 

Mr. Ichino stopped. He looked 
down the table at them. He had 
always had to hold himself in 
check before people like these, 
he realized, men with closed faces. 
He could not speak to them, let the 
soft things within him come out. 

“I have found," he said 
haltingly, his mind filled with 
fleeting impulses and images, 
“something I never expected." 

He looked at their blank eyes and 
set faces. 

They were silent. 

“I began with a simple code, 
based on arithmetical analogies 
to words. The machine picked up 
the system at once. We began a 
conversation. I learned nothing 
about it— that was not my assign- 
ment. But what struck me—" 
‘Where were the words? “What 
struck me was the nimbleness it 
displays. We exchanged elementary 
mathematics, physics, number 
theory. It gave me, I think, a 
proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. 
Its mind — if that’s the word- 
leaps from one subject to another 
and is perfectly at home. When it 
^poke of mathematics it was cool 
and efficient, never wasting a word. 
Then it asked for poetry." 

The man in tweeds was watching 



30 



IF 




Mr. Ichino intently, sucking on his 
pipe, which had gone out. 

“I do not know how it discovered 
poetry. Perhaps from commercial 
radio. I told it what I knew and 
gave it examples. It seemed to 
understand. Next it began to ask 
for art. It was interested in every- 
thing from oils to sculpture. 1 
undertook the encoding problems 
involved, even to the point of 
fixing for it the right portion of the 
electromagnetic spectrum for 
viewing the . pictures we sent." 

He spread his hands and spoke 
more rapidly. “It is like sitting 
in a room and speaking to someone 
you cannot see. One inevitably 
assigns a personality to the other. 
Each time the Marauder— ii wants 
to know everything— changed the 
subject matter under discussion 
there was this feeling of different- 
ness, as if — ” Mr. Ichino saw the 
cold, distilling eyes of Evers and 
hurried on, stumbling over his 
words. “It was as if Lwere speaking 
each time to a different personality. 
In turn a mathematician, a poet — 
he even wrote sonnets, good ones — 
a scientist, an artist — he is so 
large, I— “ 

Mr, Ichino paused. He felt the air 
tightening around him, the men at 
the table drawing back. He was 
saying things beyond his com- 
petence. When had the machine 
become “he” in his mind? He was 



only a cryptographer, not 
qualified. 

Across the table from Mr. 
Ichino, Williams stared into the 
space between them, distracted. He 
said slowly, “1 see, I see, yes. That 
is what it is like. 1 had never 
thought of it that way before, 
but—” Williams put both hands 
flat on the table, as though to 
push himself up. He looked with 
sudden energy up and down the 
table. “He’s right, the Marauder 
is like that. It’s many personalities, 
operating almost independently.” 

M r. ichino gazed at this 
man who shared his labor 
and for the first time saw that 
Williams, too, had been changed 
by contact with the Marauder. 
The thought lifted his spirits. 

“Independently,” Mr. Ichino 
said. “That is it. I sense many 
aspects to his personality, each a 
separate facet. And behind them 
there is something — greater. 
Something that I cannot visualize.” 
“It’s bigger,” Williams broke in. 
“We’re seeing parts of the 
Marauder, that’s all.” Both men 
stared at each other, unable to put 
into words the enormity they 
sensed. 

Evers spoke. 

“I really think you gentlemen 
have strayed from the subject at 
hand. I asked you to describe the 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



31 




range of input the Marauder 
requested, not your own metaphy- 
sical reactions to it/' 

A few nervous chuckles sounded. 
Around the long table Mr. Ichino 
saw minds sheltered by narrowed 
eyes, judging, weighing, refusing 
to feel. 

“But this is important—” 
Williams began. 

Evers raised a hand to cut him 
off. Mr. Ichino saw in the gesture 
the final proof of why Evers was a 
Presidential adviser and he, Ichino, 
was not. 

“1 will thank you, Mr. Williams, 
to leave to the Executive Commit- 
tee the determination of what is or 
is not important.” 

Williams’s face went rigid. He 
looked across the table. Mr. Ichino 
took a deep, calming breath and 
struggled out of his confusion. 

“Yoii->^have already decided, 
haven’t you?” he asked Evers. 
.He looked at the man’s face and 
thought he saw something shift 
deep behind the eyes. “This meet- 
ing is a sham,” he said with 
certainty. 

“I don’t know what you think 
you’re — ” 

“That may be true, Mr. Evers— 
you do not know. Perhaps you 
have not admitted it to yourself 
yet. But you plan something 
monstrous, Mr. Evers, or you 
would listen to us.” 



“Look here - ” 

“You do not want to know what 
we know.” 

There was an uncomfortable 
rustle in the room. Mr. Ichino 
held Evers with his eyes, refusing 
to let the man go. The silence 
lengthened. Evers blinked, looked 
away, too casually brought a hand 
up to touch his chin and hide his 
mouth. 

“I think you two had better go,” 
Evers said in an oddly calm voice. 

There was no other sound. Mr. 
Ichino, hands clasped tightly to 
the notes before him, felt a sudden 
strange intimacy with Evers. In 
the lines around the man’s mouth 
he read an expression he had seen 
before — the trademark of the 
quick-witted executive — intelligent 
—who knew with a sure instinct 
that he carried the necessary 
toughness to decide when others 
could not. Evers loved the bal- 
ancing of one case against another, 
the talk of options and prob- 
abilities and plans. He lived 
for the making of hard choices. 

Mr. Ichino stood up. For such 
men it was impossible to do noth- 
ing, even when to do nothing was 
best. Power demanded action. 
Action meant drama and drama— 
was glory. 

Now it is out of my hands, he 
thought. 

Williams followed him out of the 



32 



IF 




room, but Mr. Ichino did not wait 
to speak to him. For the moment 
he wanted only to leave the build- 
ing. Forebodings seethed in him. 
He doubted that he would be 
allowed back in the Pit to talk 
to the Marauder again— he was 
now a risk. The thought troubled 
him but he put it aside. He signed 
out at the nearest exit and rushed 
into the thick damp air of Houston. 
It was almost noon. 

He still carried the yellow pad 
and his notes, pages crumpled in 
his fist. Going down the steps of 
the building he felt a welling tide 
of something he could instantly 
name and, dropping the pages, 
dropping all, he ran. He ran. 

V 

I T WAS pleasant to drift, re- 
strained by the buckles and 
pads, and spin soft coils of illusion. 
The random splotchings of craters 
wheeled below, each slipping under 
the arched horizon just before he 
had memorized it. 0\^ friend lost 
without a farewell handshake — 
memory of a million such. When 
shaking hands, remember your 
manners, Kenneth — take off your 
glove first (cold snatching at your 
fingers) . 

His mind wandered. 

Which wasn’t right, he told him- 
self. Kenneth M. Walters, called 



Ken or sometimes Kent, oddly 
enough— should stay alert. He was 
not here for the view. Nor did 
segmented tanks of liquid oxygen 
ride to the side of him, above, 
below, directly behind, for his own 
coy amusement. They waited for 
the signal, a soft pressure on a 
button, to bum him straight into 
history. 

Or into the abyss beyond Earth’s 
web, he thought. Hipparchus Con- 
trol-awesome name for six sheet- 
metal huts buried in twenty feet 
of dust -had been a touch vague 
about the margin of error they 
had allowed for getting him back. 
Maybe there wasn’t any. 

Off to his right the northmost 
rim of Mare Orient ale slid into 
view, slate-gray sheets of lava 
cooled in their convulsions. The 
crater’s center lay a good fifteen 
degrees south of his near-equatorial 
orbit, but even at this low altitude 
he could see the marching moun- 
tain ranges that curved away from 
him, inward. He wondered how 
big the rock had been that caused 
that eerie effect: crests of ancient 
waves frozen into mountains. An 
enormous bull’s-eye in the moon’s 
ribs. Assassin’s knife. E)eath from 
an asteroid. 

“Hipparchus here,” a voice 
rattled and squeaked in his ear. 
“Everything okay?” 

Kenneth Walters waited a mo- 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



33 




ment and then said, “Shut up.” 
“No, it’s okay. We’ve computed 
it. This transmission is in the 
moon’s radio shadow, as far as the 
Marauder is concerned. It can’t 
pick up any of this.” 

“I thought we weren’t taking 
chances.” 

“Well, this isn’t exactly a 
chance.” The voice sounded a bit 
peevish. “We just wanted to see 
how things are going up there. We 
don’t get any telemetry. You 
could be dead for all we know.” 
He could not think of anything 
to say to that, so he let it go. The 
radioman — who was it, that short 
guy, Lewis?— seemed to think 
he was just making a neighborly 
call. The phones crackled and 
sputtered in his ears for a moment 
while he waited out the other man. 
Finally the voice came a little 
more strongly. 

“Well, we have a good fix on the 
time, anyvay. About five hours 
away. Squirting the scoop to 
your LogEx now.” 

There was a hum from the . 
electronics beside him as the 
computer absorbed the orbital 
data. He was sure now it was 
Lewis down there — the man was 
addicted to jargon. 

“Have you rechecked your 
missiles?” Lewis asked. 

“Yes— Uh— roger.” 

“We just had a squirt from 



Houston to remind you about 
priorities. Any piece of it is 
better than nothing, so hold off 
on the nuke if you can.” 

“Roger.” 

“Feeling okay? You’ve been up 
there more than a day now. It 
must be getting cramped.” 

“Ever been to Mars?” 

“Huh? Oh, I see what you 
mean. But you had the works then, 
drugs, full hypno. Say, I never did 
ask you about that. I mean, how it 
felt to be under that long.” 

“No, you never did.” 

There was another silenced 
“Well, it must feel different, this 
one being a combat mission. Not 
the same.” 

“Sweating like a pig.” 

“Yeah, really?” The voice 
brightened. “We’ll get you back 
okay. Don’t worry, fella.” 

“Say hello to the guys down 
there,” Kenneth mumbled. He had 
felt he ought to say something 
friendly. Lewis wasn’t a bad guy, 
just too chummy. 

“We’re all rooting for you. Zap 
that thing and Houston will sure 
be happy. If—” 

“I’d better go over that flight 
plan.” 

“Oh, okay. Signing off.”

Optimism. That was what he

with no one to see. The loss did 
not seem to matter. 

He looked back, however, trying 
to remember when it had 
happened .

^made jokes about having been 
so crowded on the flight home that 
he had had to comb his hair with 
his toes. When asked about the on- 
board computer’s role in the 
mission he said something blandly 
nice about Roger (though he did 
get in a limerick about Roger the 
lodger, the dirty old codger . 
that NBC cut from their early 
show, but CBS left in). He spell- 
bound his audiences with descrip- 
tions of the ruddy Martian low- 
lands. He slept with women. 

Before Sure Thing he had 
somehow always met girls. After 
it, he met women. Or more to the 
point, they met him. They drifted 
his way at parties, seemingly 
inspecting the Cezanne prints, and 
abruptly came upon him, round 
doe eyes widening in polite sur- 
prise at his identity (yes, he was 
the one) and hand unconsciously 
going to the throat to caress a 
necklace or scarf, intimate sensual 
gesture to be read if he cared. 

Often he cared. Often they were 



electric women, aware in some 
secret bastion that this man had 
been where they could not go, for 
reasons they did not fathom but 
which suggested something basic 
and feral, some mysterious male 
rite performed beyond the horn- 
rimmed clinical gaze of psycholo- 
gists and pundits and, most 
important, away from women. 

They were of many types. {How 
masculine, one of them said, 
patting yellow hair into place, 
to think of women as types. Em- 
barrassed — for this was New York, 
where differences were unfashion- 
able that year — he laughed and 
threw some chablis at the back of 
his throat and left her soon after- 
ward, reasoning that, after all, 
he did not like her type.) But they 
had gained a sameness for him, 
though he sampled the Junoesque, 
the wiry, the darkly sensual, the 
Rubens maiden and some mon- 
grels. How not to call them types 
just to tell them apart? The urge 
to classify washed always over him, 
to analyze and inspect — as he said 
to a catty aging 3D actress in a 
worldwide interview, “They were 
weighed and found wanton”— 
and at last he came to look upon 
himself as from a distance, pacing 
his responses, never moving wholly 
with the moment. There he quit. 
And went back to his job, which 
was, after all, enough. He needed 



36 



IF 




women, but he did not need the 
kind who were drawn to him. 

B y that time 3D had made a 
minor personality of him. He 
began to accept exposure as it 
suited him, which happened to 
result in the optimum intervals 
for his remaining what a PR man 
had called “alive” without “satu- 
rating his image.” 

He appeared on a mildly intel- 
lectual talk show and revealed a 
more than passing knowledge of 
the works of Louis Armstrong. 
He was interviewed during a long 
walk in the Sierras, wearing a 
sweatsuit and talking about what 
he had learned from the NASA 
meditation course. It wasn’t great 
material, but the networks were 
scrambling for something halfway 
intelligent. With 3D execs, any- 
thing that tickled their noses they 
thought was champagne. And the 
housewives and garage mechanics 
didn’t get bored with Kenneth 
Walters either, because he laughed 
and told jokes and dropped sly 
little bits of inside scoop into the 
conversation about the infighting 
at NASA. 

He was inordinately lucky. 
Something would boil up from 
his subconscious and he would put 
it into a sentence or two, and 
suddenly Parsons would be in 
trouble about his complicity in 



cutting the manned component at 
Hipparchus or stopping the in- 
frared telescope abuilding in orbit 
or keeping women out of the 
program. 

And in the sweet rushing fullness 
of time Parsons was no longer 
director of NASA. A news com- 
mentator said Kenneth had a 
positive talent for telling the 
right truth at the right time — right 
for Kenneth — and it was doubly 
surprising when the faculty for 
truth-telling left him, utterly, 
after Parsons resigned. A few of 
the men told him the moves had 
saved his career — that before he 
had gone on 3D he had been 
marked as a leading target for 
the next Night of the Long Knives. 
Houston— they murmured casu- 
ally, looking into their branch- 
water-and-bourbon — hadn’t been 
too happy about some of his trans- 
missions from Mars orbit, 
bellyaching (their word) about 
coming home. Kenneth listened 
carefully to their admirations of 
his maneuvering skill, but he knew 
it was misplace. He had done in 
Parsons out of sheer personal 
dislike — no principle at all had 
been involved — and his subcon- 
scious knew it. As soon as the 
irritant had been removed, the sly 
Medici within him slipped into 
slumber and Kenneth returned to 
being a working astronaut. The 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



37 




program sensed his potential 
power — once stung, twice paranoid 
— and more or less gave him the 
duty he wanted. When a spot 
opened in the thrice-yearly rotation 
at Hipparchus he applied for it and 
got it. He was short and kept up his 
breath control— he was precisely 
the man to use for long Rover 
missions in the highlands, working 
in a two-man team. 

At last, on the moon, younger 
men were making their way in the 
program. The early test-pilot 
astronauts, thoroughly married 
and nearing their middle years, 
reeking of oatmeal virtues, couldn’t 
make it at Hipparchus. They were 
fine for flights and quick explora- 
tory landings, but they couldn’t 
keep up the pace during the long 
marches and climbs. So, into an 
age leached of glory came the 
return of gallant young men, 
bleached hair cropped close to the 
skull, who kept the space program 
hobbling along with an occasional 
newsworthy exploit. 

Toward the end of his rest after 
Sure Thing, the Mars flight, 
Kenneth had been interviewed on 
a late-night talk program. The 
gentleman philosopher who 
“hosted” the program — meaning 
it was his show — had mentioned 
that Kenneth had performed “one 
of the great acts of our civilization.” 
Kenneth had told him no, that the 



great deeds always came in quiet, 
lonely rooms, where men and 
women worked for that most 
elusive of all things, a truly 
original idea. 

Maybe, Kenneth thought to 
himself, watching Earth set behind 
a crumpled, gray-brown horizon, 
maybe ! was even right. The host 
had murmured a precisely timed 
assent and shifted the subject- 
television does not fix on private 
experiences but public ones. Still, 
now Kenneth had come to it, too 
— waiting, alone, to drive home 
the blade. Or, failing that, a 
bludgeon. In solitude, very nearly 
as a private act. Private. But public. 

T he first indication had come 
in the form of increased radio 
traffic with Houston. Kenneth 
was mercifully spared radio duty 
because of rank, so he first heard 
of the Marauder when the Hip- 
parchus Base commander called 
him in for a preliminary briefing. 

Three other men were there, 
alternate candidates for the mis- 
sion, but Houston had made it 
clear that one Kenneth M. Walters 
was much preferred. Why? None 
of them could say, except that he 
did have more deep-space experi- 
ence than the others. Too, he had 
reacted well during some foul-ups 
of Sure Thing and — perhaps more 



38 



IF 




significant— administrative changes 
at NASA had erased Houston’s 
memories of his independence. 

The four men at Hipparchus were 
told about the Marauder and 
Scenario Eight a week before 
Eight was to be executed. They 
heard, too, of the poor bastard 
who had decoyed the Marauder 
into a Venus orbit and had been 
fired as a result (a light sentence, 
Houston felt, but after all, he was 
a civilian). 

One week was just barely enough 
time to arrange the modules for 
carrying extra fuel, checking out 
the systems and working out some 
alternate scheduling in case of 
mishap. It took everyone at the 
Base to assemble the launch 
vehicle and pilot’s cabin in time. 
The nuclear-tipped rockets were 
already on their way from Earth 
orbit, carried aboard the supply 
shuttle. 

Arranging the myriad valves and 
connections, checking out servo 
systems and interface parameters — 
each man carried a gallery of facts 
and numbers and details inside his 
head, worked doggedly to the limit 
of the pills and. shots he was 
given and, in the span of five days, 
individually and collectively con- 
verted a blueprint into hardware. 

T O PASS the time he read a 
novel from the cabin’s erasable 



slate. With some forethought 
Kenneth had brought along a pack 
of four memorex crystals, each 
book length. In the first day of 
waiting he had devoured two of 
them. He privately gave even odds 
that Scenario Eight would not 
come off at all and reading relaxed 
him. It also provided a distraction. 
Even a view of the moon from 
twenty-seven miles up can pall 
after a while. 

A phrase caught his eye: 

. at an attitude toward 
Attaturk . 

Later, as he was musing down at 
the flinty plain of Mare Smythii, 
it came back to him. He treated 
the words as he might an algebraic 
expression, factoring out all the 
fl’s, then the /’s. Rearranged, the 
words could yield ambiguity, in- 
coherence, passable poetry. He 
wondered if he had given in to a 
neurotic compulsion. Memory of 
case histories from library shelves 
came to him — women who never 
passed a lamppost without 
touching it, men who balanced 
always on the ball of the left foot 
while urinating, outfielders who 
had to take a skip before throwing 
the ball to home plate. 

He shrugged and divided the 
phrase into thirds, quarters, 
eighths, thought of an anagram, 
fiddled with the punctuation. 

The moon turned.

HAT ignition time is hold- 
X ing okay/’ Lewis again, 
seven orbits later. 

“What does Houston say?” 
Kenneth asked. 

''^‘Marauder is holding to course, 
decelerating at a fixed rate. Looks 
like its final orbit will be about 
a thousand miles out.” 

“What’s it saying to Houston?” 
“How would 1 know? They use 
some special code, sounds like 
to me. 1 listened in some and 1 
couldn’t spot any of the usual 
patterns, no Morse or anything 
like that.” 

“^Morse isn’t handy for com- 
puters. Too redundant or not 
redundant enough something.” 
“Well, they’re keeping it busy. 
The Scenario calls for beaming 
a lot of hot stuff out to the 
Marauder just as it comes in and 
starts maneuvering. I guess they’re 
answering the questions those 
computers wanted to know all 
along, only Houston wouldn’t 
tell.” 

“1 wonder what it thought, sitting 
over near Venus.” Kenneth paused. 
“They couldn’t be dumb, those 
machines. They must have Figured 
out right away that Venus 
couldn’t support any life.” 

“I wouldn’t be so sure about 
that. It stayed put for five months.” 
“Maybe it was just being 
diplomatic.” 



Lewis chuckled, making a cack- 
ling hollow sound in Kenneth’s 
helmet speakers. “That thing’s 
a computer, Ken. And not even 
one designed by humans. It’s 
just a searcher, that’s all.” 

“If that’s what it is — why is it 
hanging around? After it sent out 
that big directional radio signal 
toward Ursa Major it should have 
moved on to the next star.” 

“Well, that’s why you’re getting 
set to cripple it, Ken. To be sure 
it doesn’t get any closer to Earth.” 
“And to give us a chance to 
pick its brains.” 

“Yeah, right. But remember, 
zap it if it looks like it’s getting 
away. That’s what Houston says.” 
“Sure.” He waited, mistrusting 
a sudden impulse to exchange 
small talk with Lewis. Kenneth 
Walters, the media man, wanting to 
sound off. “What does Houston 
know?” 

“Huh?” Thin thread of surprise 
in the voice. 

“Houston thinks the Marauder 
is a recon operation. That doesn’t 
have to be so. That guy Cains 
handed it a line about us living 
on Venus at the first, to keep it 
at arm’s length. The Marauder 
probably transmitted some of that 
crap back to its home.” 

“So?” 

“Now it’s got to amend that 
report. It probably doesn’t trust 



40 



IF 




Houston much any more— it wants 
a look for itself.” 

“Let it look from Venus.’- 
“If somebody had told it we 
thought it was carrying alien 
diseases— or wanted to steal our 
wives and children— maybe the 
thing would stay away. Anybody 
try that?” 

“Houston doesn’t want to tip 
our hand and let that thing know 
we’re afraid of it, Ken,” Lewis 
said, sounding a little exasperated. 
“We want a shot at a sitting duck.” 
“A finger in the eye.” 

“What’s that?” 

“You ever think how old that 
thing must be? Our lives are so 
short that to the Marauder we must 
look like bacilli. Whole eras and 
dynasties snuffed out in an instant. 
It looks at us with its microscope 
and makes lab notes while we try to 
poke a finger in its eye.” 

“Hey, no wonder you were a hit 
on the late show. If this ever gets 
out to the public, you can use your 
lines in one of those magazine 
articles.” 

“I never wrote any.” 

“Not even about Mars?” 

“No, I’m a media man. Aural- 
visual. Let your slides do the work.” 
“You’re coming out of the radio 
shadow, Ken. I’ve already squirted 
your LogEx the corrections.” 
“Okay, see you on the next pass.” 
He was moving into the sun’s 



white glare again. The cabin popped 
and pinged and snicked as it 
warmed. A plaster of Paris crater 
below lay bisected by the termi- 
nator, its central cone perfectly 
symmetric. Its rim was round and 
seemed smooth. Four distinct 
terraces marched down to the floor. 

Snick, went his cabin. 

Waiting at the edge of infinity, he 
thought. On the smooth shore of 
the ocean of night, marking the 
minutes until the winged stranger 
arrived. An actor, not knowing his 
lines, ready to go onstage for his big 
Scenario. 

Maybe he should have been an 
actor, after all. He had tried it once, 
in college, before engineering and 
flight training had swallowed up his 
hours. He had wanted to be an 
actor, but his father had talked him 
into becoming a Kenneth Walters. 

He warmed a tube of tea and 
sipped it, as well as anyone can sip 
from a squeeze bottle. The sun 
streamed in. Tea was a warm hand 
in the dark. Reeling with Darjeel- 
ing, he thought, and maybe, after 
all, I did fool old Dad in the end. 
Sure Thing had been a straight bit 
of acting, with Providence kindly 
providing a busy coda of danger 
after the landing. And here he was 
for his next engagement, carefully 
primed, all the props in place. 
Opening night coming up, all the 
Top Secret Clearance audience 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



41 




clustered about TV sets. Best of all 
—no critics. This actor, a well- 
grounded student of the Method 
School, is noted for his whole- 
hearted interest in and devotion to 
his performance. His previous work, 
while controversial, has won him 
some notoriety. He prefers roles 
that seem to point a moral at the 
end, so the audience, will believe 
they understood it all along. 

He smiled to himself. A man with 
his finger on the trigger can afford 
a few cosmic thoughts. Politics 
becomes geometry, philosophy is 
calculus. The universe winds about 
itself, snakelike, events plotted 
along coiled coordinates with a fine 
tight geometry, the scrap paper of 
a mad mathematician. 

He raised an eyebrow at the idea. 
I wonder what they put in this tea. 

VI 

\^LTERS?” 

They had called him several 
times, but he had been slow to 
answer. 

“Tm busy.” 

“Got your systems repped and 
verified?” Lewis spoke quickly, 
slurring one word into another and 
making it hard to piece together the 
sentence. “We received that squirt 
from your onboard diagnostics on 
your last pass. Breakdown shows 



no serious trouble. A little over- 
pressure on the backup tanks, but 
Houston says it is within tolerable 
operating limits. It looks like 
you’re cleared.” 

Kenneth turned off the inboard 
reading lights before replying. The 
cockpit became bathed in the deep 
red of the running lights. For a 
moment he saw only blackness, 
then his eyes adjusted. He had seen 
this warm red glow thousands of 
times before, but now the sight 
seemed fresh and strange, portend- 
ing events just beyond the point of 
articulation. Dante, he thought, 
has been here before me. 

Well, he would give them what 
they wanted. He thumbed over to 
transmit. 

“I verify, Hipparchus. Staging 
timetable is logged. LH2/LOX 
reading four-oh-three-eight. Ser- 
vitor inventory just completed and 
LogEx reports all subsystems and 
backups are functional.” 

“I have a relay for you.” 

“What?” 

A buzz, a hiss of solar static, 
then a smooth, well modulated 
voice: “Ken, this is George Evers. 
I’m chairman of ExComm down 
here — we came up with Scenario 
Eight. I asked Hipparchus to patch 
me through to clear up any last- 
minute questions.” 

“I haven’t got any. Just be sure 
Marauder doesn’t put on any sud- 



42 



IF 




den burst of speed. Understand?" 

“Quite right," Evers said gravely, 
his voice dropping an octave. 
“However, we are sure the Ma- 
rauder will never see you. You will 
have the sun at yoUr back all the 
way in on your run. There isn’t any 
radar in the world that can pick you 
up against that background." 

“In the world— w/n." 

“Oh, I see. Well — ’’ Evers gave a 
small, self-deprecating chuckle—" 
it’s just a phrase. But our people 
here feel strongly that there are 
certain rules of thumb about de- 
tection equipment that hold true in 
every situation, even this one. I 
wouldn’t worry about it." Pause. 
“But the reason I’m taking up your 
time, Ken — and I see we have only 
a few minutes left — is to impress 
upon you your obligations on this 
mission. We down here cannot 
predict what the Marauder will do. 
The final decisions are up to you, 
although we will be in contact as 
soon as we are sure that the Ma- 
rauder has detected you — if it ever 
does, that is. To be sure, that might 
be long after the time for any effec- 
tive action on your part is past. We 
will do all we can from this end, of 
course. For the last few hours we 
have been transmitting a wealth of 
cultural information on mathe- 
matics, science, art and so on. 
ExGomm hopes this will serve as a 
diversion to the computers in the 



Marauder, though we have no way 
of knowing for certain. Meanwhile 
our satellites circling the moon will 
monitor radio transmissions to 
keep us in touch. Silence is essen- 
tial. Do not broadcast on any band 
until the Marauder shows unmis- 
takable signs of having seen you." 

“I know all that." 

“We just want you to have these 
things clear in your mind. There 
was no time for a proper briefing. 
You have two small missiles with 
chemical warheads. If they are not 
sufficient to cripple the Marauder s 
propulsion, then the nuclear—’’ 

Kenneth Walters cut in: “I’ve 
got to check out something." 

Evers’ words ran on for a few 
seconds, until the time lag due to 
the finite speed of light caught up. 
It was obvious to Ken that he had 
interrupted a prepared speech. The 
beauty of his situation was that no 
one could tell from telemetry 
whether he had something to do or 
not. 

He said, “Okay now." 

Evers came back. “One last 
thing, Ken. This Marauder could 
be inconceivably dangerous to 
humanity. If anything seems to be 
going wrong, kill it. No, that’s too 
strong. The thing is just a machine, 
Ken. Intelligent, yes, but it is not 
alive. Well, good luck. We’re 
counting on you down here." 

The sputter of static returned. 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



43 




T ime trickled into the past, and 
he frowned, trying to make the 
memories fit. 

His father had slipped away dur- 
ing Ken’s college years, become a 
fading echo. The man had given his 
son a drab litany of success to live 
by— shoulders-to-the-wheel and all 
that— with a high nervous certainty 
that he, Kenneth, would fly where 
the father had merely walked. But 
he had coughed out his last spark 
before Sure Thing was born and 
had never known that his son had 
made it big, vindicated his withered 
life. 

Poor father, he would have been 
awed by Parsons, by the multi- 
colored telephones in the NASA 
offices and the legion of heel- 
clickers enslaved to them. Ah, and 
the fame that had followed Sure 
Thing — father would have rolled 
and basked in that, too, loving 
the delicious small warmths of 
celebrity. 

The old man’s solid, easy assur- 
ance had guided Kenneth, but when 
he looked back he found it hollow. 
So the faith of his father was empty. 

Now he spun in night, suspended 
above choices made and aban- 
doned, searching. Rather than fake 
a head cold and let one of the three 
eager backup pilots take Scenari 
Eight, he had thrust himself into the 
crucible of events again, seeking 
definition. 



His beard itched. He resisted the 
urge to scratch it, knowing that 
would only make the itch worse, 
and allowed himself a mad grin, 
rolled his eyes, let forth a hollow 
groan, stretched his legs and arms. 

He dabbed at his teeth with a 
soft wet tongue, tasting orange 
juice. He had been drinking it when 
Evers called. Some sliding waver 
in the way the man spoke, some 
thread of uncertainty had come into 
the cabin with that voice. Evers 
was NASA was Parsons was — 

Kenneth did not complete the 
steps, fearing where they led. 

He studied the distant vortex of 
white storm clouds over India and 
tried not to think. His fingers 
trembled. 

Time. Time to see it all. He 
needed more. But time was gone, 
the green clock said; he went for- 
ward to meet the moment, to put 
himself on the anvil again. 

HAVE^aburn.” 

He whispered it to him- 
self through tight and bloodless 
lips. He was being pressed to 
geometric flatness by the magic 
hand of the multistage rocket and, 
though he breathed shallow short 
gasps and concentrated on timing 
them precisely, the pain would not 
stop shooting through the soft 
organs of his belly. He closed his 
eyes to find a red haze and imag- 



44 



IF 




ined himself a sunbather pinned 
to the hard sand, vaguely con- 
scious of the distant rumble of the 
surf. 

The Pacific. He had been sta- 
tioned in California during aqua- 
naut training, growing tan be- 
tween hot dunes and clear water 
startling in its coldness. He re- 
membered long and agonizing runs 
on the beach between La Jolla and 
Del Mar, recalled himself churn- 
ing doggedly past forests of firm 
young thighs, sun shimmering 
through a thin haze of sweat that 
ran into his eyes. Cantilevered 
breasts — or more stylishly, bare 
ones, brown nipples pouting— 
had swung to follow his progress, 
deliciously red lips had spread to 
wide grins at his grunts and 
wheezes. Surf had foamed white 
to the side, ragged margin to blue- 
green ocean. As his arms and legs 
had grown leaden he had diverted 
himself with glimpses of the fi- 
gures and faces passing by, mov- 
ing stride by stride into his past. 
Small families, leathery men, 
serenely nude couples, dogs— all 
had acted out small plays in his 
head, populated his preconceived 
universe, frozen while snarled in 
tiny dramas of fear and aching lust, 
boredom and laughter, all parties 
taking all parts. 

The pressing fist was lifted. He 
blinked, located a toggle switch. 



saw a light turn green. Separation. 
The fist returned. 

Combat mission. Enemy. Tar- 
get. He had not used those words 
for years— they were childhood 
terms. Galoshes. Skate key. 

As the days stand up on end. 
My friend . 

His uncle had fought in some 
grimy jungle conflict, somewhere, 
had told stories about it, resolv- 
ing all complicated political theory 
with the unanswerable gut reality 
of a souvenir pistol and bayonet, 
proudly displayed. Ken had 
thought it a minor eccentricity, 
like owning a complete fifty-year 
run of The National Geographic, 

The fist lifted. 

The fist returned. 

A rivulet of spittle ran down his 
chin. He licked at it, unwilling 
to move a hand. His eyes ached. 
Each of his kidneys was a sullen 
lump just beneath the skin of his 
back. 

Iron and oil. 

Brought to a boil. 

Abruptly he floated. The dull 
rumble died. He sucked in air, 
feeling life return to his numbed 
arms and legs. Automatically he 
scanned the regiments of lights 
before him. 



IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT

He was flying blind, no radar 
to guide him. After a few minutes 
of checking he activated the fire- 
control center and received ac- 
knowledgments from the com- 
puters that rode in the missiles. 
Then he rotated his couch to get a 
full view put the. large observation 
port. 

Nothing. The port was black, 
vacant. He logged the time and 
checked the running printout on 
his slate. The burn was right, his 
heading was dead on. The Ma- 
rauder was coming in for an orbit 
around the moon, as Houston had 
asked it to, and he would come up 
from behind, closing fast. 

He glanced through the port 
again. Nothing. Now that he was 
on a definite mission, moving, the 
complete radio silence was eerie. 
Through the side port he could see 
the back of the moon fall away, an 
endless dirty gray plain of jumbled 
craters. 

He searched the main port care- 
fully, watching for relative motion 
against the scattered jewels of the 
fixed stars. He was studying the 
star field so intently that he nearly 
missed the bright point of light that 
drifted slowly into view. 

H e swung the viewing tele- 
scope down from its mount. 
Magnified, the diamond point 
resolved into a small pearl. The 



Marauder was a sphere, silvery, 
with no apparent markings. 

He could see no means of pro- 
pulsion. Perhaps they were on the 
other side of the object or not 
operating at the moment. It didn’t 
matter — his missiles had both 
heat-seeking and radar guidance 
and could find the Marauder s 
fusion flame if it were on. 

He squinted, trying to estimate 
the range. But he had no idea of 
how large the ship was, other than 
Houston’s early estimate that it 
had to be less than three hundred 
yards in radius, based on data from 
the Venusian satellites. 

He peered at it. The Marauder 
had come from some vast dis- 
tance, sifting through scattered 
suns, searching for a matching 
glimmer of intelligence. For its 
journey to end so suddenly, here— 
if the missile hit wrong, burned 
away its fine-spun matrix of in- 
organic intelligence— would be 
awesome waste . 

Kenneth broke off the thought. 
He fumbled with the buttons on 
the fire-control breadboard, rush- 
ing himself into something he did 
not want to think about too clearly. 

He aligned, corrected and with 
an executioner’s grace snapped 
the button home. From the left 
port came a bright orange flare and 
a blunt thump as death took wing. 
A spike of light spurted ahead. It

IF 




was a burning gaseous star, a 
sharp matchpoint of flame, then a 
shrinking dot that homed with bit- 
ter resolve. 

Kenneth fidgeted. A shrill beep 
rattled in the cabin as automatic 
tracking followed the missile. Red 
numerals showing course adjust- 
ments flickered and died on the 
board before him. 

The idiot beep quickened. The 
point of light swept smoothly 
toward the blurred outline before 
it. 

Kenneth sucked in his breath, 
held it. 

The sky splintered. 

An eye-searing ball of flame bil- 
lowed out. It thinned, paled. He 
pressed back into his couch, not 
moving, nostrils flared. The beep 
was gone and only a faint burr of 
radio static reached him. He hung 
suspended, waiting. He stared 
ahead. 

Beyond the slowly dulling circle 
of flame a dab of light moved to the 
left. Its image wavered and then 
resolved into an intact, perfect 
sphere. 

Kenneth realized that the 
chemical warhead had detonated 
prematurely. A wave of unex- 
pected hope filled him. He blinked, 
trying to comprehend his own 
feelings. 

The silvery ball drifted slowly 
leftward and he automatically cor- 



rected his course, feeling a tug of 
acceleration at his back. His mind 
tumbled, seeking something to 
hold. 

Evers said to use the nuke, use 
the nuke use the nuke if the other 
missiles failed. Evers said . Evers 
said. 

He corrected again, pursuing, 
feeling the tightening clutch of the 
straps. The pearl grew slightly, 
wobbled as he fired starboard jets 
and brought her on target again. 
He enjoyed the calming rhythm of 
work, of knowing what he was 
about. But the moment could not 
be put off. He punched in the final 
sequence of instructions and armed 
the one missile he had not ex- 
pected to use. It rode directly 
above his head, waiting in the 
secure nest of its pod. 



E FOUND the button. He 
was thumb-fingered and 
moved slowly. The firing button 
for the nuclear-tipped missile sat 
alone in a small, bracketed section 
of the board. Kenneth could not 
take his eyes from it. He knew the 
radiation and shock waves from a 
nuclear warhead would probably 
kill the pearl. He knew it and he 
could not move. 

A voice asked, “Do you know 
me so well?” 

Kenneth froze. The voice came 




IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



47 




from his helmet speakers, free of 
static. 

“Who—” he began and stopped. 
“Do you ride such comfortable 
winds that you can live counter 
to your best nature?” 

“You’re speaking? You- ” 

“I speak for my. life.” 

“How do you know what I am 
doing?” Kenneth asked numbly. 

“1 have seen the dark side of your 
race. There are fewer walls than 
you may think. I have met this be- 
fore — in different light.” 

The sphere ahead moved slightly 
to the right, out of his field of view. 
When he found it again through 
the telescope it seemed to have 
shrunk. 

“I — I don’t know what you—” 
he stammered. 

“You are alone. I do not under- 
stand how you people can divide 
guilt, but out here I know it cannot 
be done. You are one man and you 
have no place to hide.” 

“If I — press this button — ” 

“You will make mean comfort 
for yourself. You are ready?” 

“1 hadn’t thought that— 
that—” 

“Your folk are often double.” 

“I didn’t think you would be 
quite—” 

He hesitated, his mind spinning 
soundlessly on fine threads over the 
abyss. The button beneath his 
finger became a stone, himself the 



sword, terrible in its weight. 

A click, buzz, static. The voice 
passed from him. 

“Walters, Walters. Evers here. 
Intersection should have occurred. 
We just got a fragment of some 
transmission — part of it sounded 
like you. What’s happened?” 

K enneth Walters 

reached for the switch that 
would allow him to transmit and 
found it already on, warm meter 
glowing. 

“I don’t know,” he said. 

More static. Houston was prob- 
ably using one of the lunar satel- 
lites to relay. 

“Well, you had damn better 
find out. About a minute ago we 
picked up a signal of some sort 
from the surface, too. Parallax puts 
the source near Mare Marginis. 
We thought maybe the Marauder 
had altered course and landed 
there.” 

“No, it’s right in front of me.” 
Kenneth peered out and found 
the pearl on black velvet. From the 
tail of it came a line of brightness, 
dimming the silver glow. It was 
clean and precise, carving order 
from the chaotic darkness that 
enveloped it. He felt his eyes be- 
come damp and he did not know 
why, though he felt a longing he 
had not known for many years. It

IF 




moved, captive of vastness, inex- 
pressibly lonely. 

“Walters! Report. Did the 
missile go off all right?” 

“Yes.” 

A blur of sound. ” -score? Did 
it score?” 

“In a manner of speaking.” 

“What?” 

“It detonated before it hit. No 
damage.” 

“And the backup? We haven’t 
registered any jump in radiation 
levels.” 

With a gathering rush, softly, 
Kenneth Walters felt a weight 
lifted from him. A clarity came 
into his world. He knew at last 
where he was, the rank and order 
of things, sensed the welling 
rhythm of events. He perceived a 
straightness he had not seen be- 
fore, a simple and direct channel 
within him that restored balance. 

Without premonition, letting 
the words come out, he said, “You 
forced matters this way, didn’t 
you, Evers?” 

“What way? What are you talk- 
ing about?” 

“You forced death when you 
could have risked life,” he said 
mildly. 

Silence. Then: “Now, Ken, 

there is a job to be done out there. 
You don’t have time—” 

“No, I don’t. Not for this 
conversation.” 

IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT 



“Listen to me, Ken.” A hint of 
urgency. “I’ve put all our bets on 
you— the game depends on your — ” 
Kenneth wondered at how 
smoothly Evers’ voice slid from the 
ragged edge of anger to silky 
persuasiveness — which tone was 
natural to the man? Or was he 
nothing but false notes? 

“Goodbye, coach.” 

“Walters? Walters? Report! 
What is the situation there? We—” 
Ken thumbed away from that 
frequency. 

T he moment of silence was 
filled only with his breathing. 
The crackling static had fallen 
away. 

“It was not false, what I have 
learned,” the voice said. “You, be- 
hind me, are one man who is not so 
hobbled and coiled.” 

“I wonder,” Kenneth said. 

“Your race has a stream of 
tongues. You communicate with 
many senses. These were hard for 
me. And I could not seem to find 
in the men who spoke to me the 
things that were in your books and 
art. It was as though there were two 
species. I did not understand that 
each man is so different.” 

“Of course.” 

“I have met other beings who 
were not,” the voice said simply. 
“How could that be? Did they 

49 




follow instinctive patterns — like 
insects?” 

“No. They lived in a vast sea. 
Perhaps that explains some things. 
They were easier to fathom than 
your diversity. You are a tensed 
race, always moving in many di- 
rections at once. .1 have, never seen 
such turbulence. I am afraid I 
cannot stay near such danger.” 
Kenneth felt a tug of disap- 
pointment, but he smiled. “It’s 
easy to see why you can’t under- 
stand us. The damned speak 
frantically.” 

“No.” 

“But we are damned. Coinpared 
to you we have little time.” 

“Eight hundred thousand of 
your years are still not enough. 
Your time is short and vivid, 
mine — I scream sometimes in 
this night.” 

“Good God.” A pause. “I’d like 
to have those years, whatever you 
say. Mortality — ” 

“Is a spice. A valued one.” 

“I still would like the years.” 
“You are not damned.” 
“Damned lucky,” Kenneth 
laughed, “but still damned.” 

“What was that sound?” 
“Laughter.” 

“I see. Spice.” 

“Oh.” He smiled, this time to 
himself. “Is your care so flat?” 
After a long moment the voice 
said, “I see that it may be. Each of 



you laughs differently — 1 cannot 
recognize the pattern. Perhaps 
that is significant. Much hides 
from me— 1 was not made for 
this.” 

“But with all that time—” 

“Yes. Those who made me 
could not see so surely what would 
come from their hands. I awake 
at each new star, as they designed. 
1 perform my functions. But the 
sum is greater than the parts and — ” 
the voice paused in the drifting 
silence — “there are dreams.” 

Kenneth nodded, waiting, but 
there was nothing more. “What 
are you going to tell your 
creators?” he asked at last. 

“What happened.” The voice 
deepened. “They decide.” 

“Oh.” 

“The rest is mine, the flavors. 
Your art and the set of your 
minds, only 1 am interested in 
those. They are for my times in 
darkness.” 

“I wish you well out there.” The 
pearl was dwindling, drawing up 
unto itself. 

“If I functioned as my designers 
intended I would not need your 
blessing. I would go through that 
night blindly. But I — the part 
who speaks to you — I am an 
accident.” 

“Maybe my race is, too.” 

“I do not know. Every race is 
unique. But friend — those other 



50 



IF 




men will exact, much from you 
when I leave. Would that I could 
help.” 

Kenneth smiled, unafraid. “Well, 
it will be interesting. This was 
the first time we’ve been visited 
and now I’ve let the quail take to 
wing. They’ll crucify me, lay me 
out cold. I’ll never be out here 
again.’’ 

“Not the first — but no matter. 
You shall see. There were things 
written for you and left behind. 
Look to your moon. And perhaps 
— perhaps you should be left alone 
now. I sense that much has hap- 
pened to you and that you need 
time.’’ 

“Maybe so. I’d still like to 
know where you’re from.” 

“I do not know.” 

“Why?” 

“I was assembled by another 
like me between the spiral arms 
and sent away.” 

“As lost as we.” 

“Yes. Eight hundred thousand 
years have made it no different, 
no easier.” 

“Well. Goodbye, then.” The 
pearl was a diamond once more. 

“1 think not.” 

“Oh?” 

“1 am versed in many theologies. 
Some say you and I are not ac- 
cidents and that we shall meet 
again in different light. You are 
membrane — I am not. There are 



things within I cannot see. Per- 
haps we are all mathematics — 
perhaps everything is — and there 
is only one whole solution.” 
Kenneth thought. “1 believe I 
see something of what you mean.” 
He shook his head. “It’s hard.” 

“I must study that sound, laugh- 
ter. There is your real theology, 
the thing men truly believe.” 
“Huh?” 

“When you make that sound 
you seem to have a brief moment 
of what it is like to live as I do, be- 
yond memory. Then you are im- 
mortal. Only for an instant.” 
Kenneth laughed. 

They were rounding the back 
side of the moon, the iiarauder 
dropping away, a blue-green Earth 
rising. Earth was all he had, he 
knew. Yet he dreaded it, swimming 
in brawling life. 

The first part was going to be 
hell. They would court-martial 
him, hound him. This would be 
worse than the return from Mars, 
worse than he could possibly 
imagine. Evers would have his in- 
ning. 

He wondered if he could explain 
this brief flicker of time. He 
shrugged, eyes stinging. 

It happened to me then, my friend 
And here we go

Again. •

# OF ZWERGWELT 




i 

JOSEPH GREEN 




Did testing an alien intelligence 




require him to betray his own? 



A GENTLE breeze shook 
the leaves on the branches 
hiding him, and Conscience 
Allan Odegaard extended his non- 
reflecting binoculars to the edge 
of the green fringe. The dwarf 
had given Allan’s blind several 
sharp glances earlier, when he had 




inadvertently moved the greenery. 
At the moment it sat in its high 
nest, idly searching one lightly 
furred thigh for parasites. Allan 
saw that those it caught were dis- 
carded rather than eaten. He 
looked down to make a note. When 
he again raised, the glasses the 
dwarf was on its feet and stretching 
lazily. This male was approxi- 
mately one hundred twenty centime- 
ters tall and had characteristically^ 
broad shoulders and heavy muscu- 
lature. In one G it would weigh 
in at over fifty kilograms and 
Zwergwelt was a 1.08-G world. 
Except for the height, its resem- 
blance to a hairy naked man was 
startling. 

The dwarf stepped out of its 
carefully woven vine basket and 
dropped to a lower limb. Moving 
with the easy grace of an animal 
at home in the arboreal pathways, 
it ambled to an intersecting branch 
and shifted to the next tree, a 
nut-bearer. On a planet without 
seasons a few seeds were always 
ripe. The short hominid picked 
two large nuts as it walked toward 
the trunk. Just as the leaves 
started to hide the dwarf Allan 
saw it pause, heft one of the nuts 
and suddenly let fly. A thin scream 
overrode the soft ripping sound 
of a body falling through the 
vegetation. 

The hunter disappeared into the 



thicker lower growth, hurrying 
to reach his prey before another 
hungry predator found it on the 
ground. Allan settled back and 
wrote on his pad that an adult male 
dwarf had obtained a meal of nuts 
and meat within two minutes after 
starting its evening hunt. 

Such proficiency should have 
indicated intelligence of a relatively 
high order. But the ease with which 
the sturdy hominid had obtained 
its meal had at least as much to 
do with a bountiful environment 
as with intellect. The slain animal 
was almost certainly one of the 
large rodents who lived primarily 
off the nuts of that particular type 
of tree. The dwarfs could eat 
almost any seed, tuber or fruit in 
the woods, as well as meat. 

Once again, nothing had been 
proved. Allan stared at his note- 
book, knowing from long experi- 
ence that his three days’ worth of 
data would be inconclusive when 
statistically analyzed. The dwarfs 
had an extremely large repertory 
of situational responses, but so 
far he had not recorded any 
actions unambiguously proving 
intelligence. 

Allan gathered his gear, slipped 
on his backpack and descended 
slowly and cautiously to the 
ground. He had barely time to 
reach the field station before dark. 
He set a brisk pace through the 



54 



IF 




moderate undergrowth, glad of the 
chance to stretch cramped legs. 

O NE of the severat rocky hills 
in the area was on his left. 
Its limestone cliffside paralleled 
his path. Trees grew so close 
to the vertical wall that several 
branches touched it and a solid 
curtain of leafy vines all but 
hid the stone. Allan had passed 
this way earlier, but at a dis- 
tance. From this close some- 
thing about the rock face suddenly 
seemed odd to him, subtly wrong. 
He paused, staring at the thickest 
cover near the center. After a 
moment he identified the oddity— 
the coloring was off. 

He took a step toward the vines 
and froze when a savage scream 
sounded almost in his ear. A 
second later a heavy body landed 
on his back, knocking him to the 
ground. Short but powerful arms 
locked around his chest and a hard 
head burrowed beneath his jaw, 
sharp canines seeking the jugular. 

He exerted all his strength and 
pulled down his chin, at the same 
time rolling over and trying to pin 
his attacker. His left arm was free 
and he brought the hand around^ 
to push desperately against a 
thick jawbone, aware without pain 
that the slashing teeth had already 
cut into his neck. He heard several 
sharp clicks as his opponent tried 



to bite his fingers and abruptly 
the creature rolled Allan in turn, 
swinging its head free. Allan con- 
tinued the roll and they ended lying 
face to face on their sides. He 
brought up a knee, planted it in 
a firm belly and shoved with all 
his strength. The dwarf lost its 
grip around his shoulders, slid 
away and Allan finally had the 
use of his right arm. Almost in- 
stantly the short hominid bounced 
to its feet and launched itself in 
a dive at his throat, now exposed 
again. He doubled both legs and 
kicked. The dwarf went flying 
against the vine-covered cliff. 
Allan’s laser cleared the holster 
just as the dwarf, which had re- 
gained its footing, ended the 
combat by darting behind a bush. 
The creature was visible again an 
instant later, but Allan held his 
fire. There was a final scream of 
animal rage and the dwarf was 
gone. 

Badly shaken, Allan got to his 
feet and brushed himself off He 
was bleeding profusely from 
several lacerations of the neck, 
but none seemed deep. He opened 
his pack for the medical kit and 
applied an antiseptic coagulant. 
When the bleeding stopped he 
covered the torn areas with plasti- 
skin bandages. His clothes were 
soaked with blood, but he could 
do nothing about them. 



THE DWARFS OF ZWERGWELT

He had recognized his attacker 
—it was the female who claimed 
this territory. Whether she had 
wanted him for dinner or had 
simply been defending her land 
was a moot question. The dwarfs 
lived alone except for temporary 
alliances for mating and the 
females were fully as vicious as the 
slightly larger males. That he had 
been attacked was his own fault— 
a short detour would have kept 
him out of her way. 

Strange, he thought — he would 
never have knowingly walked into 
the territory of a female leopard 
at the time of the evening hunt, 
but had moved into the dwarPs 
area without conscious thought. 
Because she was a hominid and 
he had the deeply ingrained male 
chauvinism common to his kind? 

The dwarfs did not have a leo- 
pard's deadly claws, but their 
dentition included four long cutting 
fangs. And in addition to throwing 
nuts and branches, one male Allan 
had seen had used a knobbed 
stick as a club. Neither activity 
justified a claim of intelligence, 
but did make the creatures fear- 
some opponents. Although the 
forest abounded in herbivores 
three times their size, the omnivor- 
ous dwarfs were the only large 
meat-eaters. Allan's carelessness 
had nearly cost him his life. 

He walked to the vines against 



which he had kicked the female 
and where he had noted the dis- 
coloration. He had heard no 
sound of solid impact when the 
female had struck the wall and 
he saw why — there was a cave be- 
hind the thick cover. The dark 
opening also explained the subtle 
change in color. 

His pack held a powerlight. 
He took it out and, laser pistol 
ready, edged through the vines. 
In five meters both floor and 
ceiling started rising. Then the 
narrow tunnel widened into a small 
underground grotto. Allan moved 
the light around. He was standing 
in a circular cavern about twelve 
meters in diameter, with a low 
concave roof. The room was empty 
except for a single figure seated 
on a natural stone bench protruding 
from the rear wall. 

ALLAN focused his torch on 
XTL the lone inhabitant. It was 
a statue, apparently made of clay 
and almost human in appearance. 
The workmanship was crude, but 
the sculpture had clearly defined 
features, a normal head and four 
limbs. The scale was slightly larger 
than human. No attempt had been 
made to indicate hair. The ears 
were outsized and lips were huge 
and ugly, extending like two halves 
of a saucer broken across the mid- 
dle and lying on top of each other. 



56 



IF 




the round sides protruding. This 
was not a dwarf cast twice life 
size, nor was it a man. 

Allan moved closer and touched 
the statue, then turned his light 
and swept it across the chamber 
floor. The stone was covered with 
a fine layer of powdered lime- 
only his own footsteps showed. 
He had an almost certain feeling 
this room had not been entered 
for decades, perhaps centuries. 
And yet the oddly made crude 
figure seated on its soft stone 
bench was composed of simple 
clay and was not even fire-cured. 
It should have crumbled to pieces 
from loss of moisture within a 
few days of its making. 

Allan shook his head in baffle- 
ment, then conceded the mystery 
was beyond his immediate under- 
standing and turned away. He had 
to get back to the station. Outside 
again, he pulled the vines back in 
place. The grotto was as well 
hidden as before. 

Dusk was falling, but he could 
still easily follow the herbivore 
game trail that led toward the 
station. He walked the remaining 
three kilometers lost in thought — 
on this trail he was safe from 
attack. Who had made the statue? 
Crude art might be within the 
physical skills of the dwarfs, but 
they were not sufficiently advanced 
in culture or intelligence to have 



need for a god. And what kept the 
fragile clay together? 

The last yellow rays of Pollux 
had faded when Allan emerged 
at the base of a low hill crowned 
by the foamfab dome of the 
station, a temporary structure. 
Halfway up the hill he used a key 
to let himself through a gate in the 
charged protective fence that en- 
circled the building. Trees that 
approached the fence had been 
cut down, eliminating aerial access 
to the enclosure, but new green 
bushes were growing where the 
original brush had been burned 
away. 

At the door Allan was met by 
Victoria Gant, the chief of the 
station's nonscientific personnel. 
She was a short, dumpy brunette, 
slightly older than Allan's forty- 
eight Eryears and fanatically de- 
voted to her job. She saw the 
bandages on his neck, asked what 
had happened and insisted on 
treating the wounds again when 
Allan admitted to having been 
bitten. 

He sighed and submitted. He 
removed his upper garments and 
Victoria opened each laceration, 
poured on foaming antiseptic and 
let fresh blood and liquid run out. 
It hurt when she carefully tucked 
the torn edges of flesh back to- 
gether, but Allan gritted his teeth 
and endured. She opened a new

tube and carefully covered each 
wound with a white gel he recog- 
nized as a coagulant and flesh 
sealant, then she rebandaged 
the wounds after the bleeding 
stopped. 

“We’re late for dinner— hurry 
into some clean clothes,” Victoria 
said when Allan rose. 

She started cleaning up the small 
mess her ministrations had made 
on the floor. 

T hirty minutes later Allan 
had bathed and changed. Two 
Other dinner guests had just ar- 
rived — the director of the Zwer- 
gwelt stations. Dr. Boris Magnit- 
sky, and his aircar pilot. The 
elderly scientist spent most of 
his time at Main Base in the 
central highlands, but visited the 
three outlying field stations regu- 
larly. The four buildings were the 
only human habitations on the 
planet. The dwarfs had been 
declared intelligent and the planet 
had been proscribed except for 
rigidly controlled scientific work. 

“Did you finish today, Con- 
science?” the director asked, 
after picking delicately at his food. 
His voice was deep and pleasant, 
but had a slight quaver of age. A 
faintly sardonic smile touched 
his wrinkled face. “I’ll be returning 
to Main tomorrow if you need 
a ride.” 



Allan decided to meet the chal- 
lenge head-on. “Doctor Magnitsky, 
1 haven’t uncovered one fact that 
invalidates the observations your 
people have made of the natives’ 
intelligence,” he said slowly. “Still, 
I’m not willing to reverse a prior 
decision without an intensive in- 
vestigation of my own. I’m going 
to stay here a few more days.” 

“Then you’ll have to catch the 
regular supply run next week. We 
can’t spare the aircar for a special 
trip,” said the director, rising. He 
was a tall man stooped with age, 
the first scientist past his hundredth 
birthday Allan had seen at an 
out-planet location. Magnitsky was 
also a giant in modern biology and 
when he had reported that the 
Zwergwelt dwarfs were not intel- 
ligent, as ruled by a Conscience 
some six Eryears before. Sector 
Chief Odegaard had been dis- 
patched immediately to check 
on the claim. Politicians were 
always trying to influence the de- 
cision of a Conscience, but Mag- 
nitsky’s scientific credentials were 
impeccable. There were also 
several psychologists on his staff. 

The problem on Pollux Five had 
arisen at a bad time. World Coun- 
cil elections would be held on Earth 
within sixty days and if the New 
Roman opposition could prove 
that* a highly compatible world 
like Zwergwelt had been withheld 



58 



IF 




from colonization by error, the 
embarrassment could cost the 
Conservationist Party the election. 
The Corps of Practical Philoso- 
phers had been launched with 
tremendous fanfare some thirteen 
Eryears ago to identify and save 
from exploitation worlds contain- 
ing intelligent species. It had been 
proved on Earth that when unequal 
cultures met, the higher inevitably 
eroded and eventually destroyed 
the lower. Guns, antibiotics and 
power tools were far more easily 
absorbed than mechanized agricul- 
ture, birth control and a nine-to- 
three job. The resulting strains on 
the delicate fabric of social 
organization always pulled a less 
developed culture apart. 

After interstellar travel became 
commonplace in the twenty-first 
century the Conservationist Party 
decided not to export Earth’s 
previous mistakes. Thousands of 
worlds in the Hyades group, con- 
taining Earth and the neighboring 
clusters of Ursa Major and 
Scorpio-Centaurus, had already 
been explored. No sign had been 
found of another space-traveling 
species, but millions of new life 
forms had been discovered, many 
of them in the early stages of 
intelligence. Save for being subject 
to scientific research, worlds 
containing such species were to 
remain untouched. 



The initial glow of virtue faded 
rapidly as the Practical Philoso- 
phers— or “Consciences of Man- 
kind” as they were soon dubbed— 
did their jobs. The same factors 
that had led to the development of 
intelligence on Earth dominated 
similar worlds, with the result 
that planet after planet suitable 
for colonization was ruled ineligi- 
ble. Now even the Conservationists 
found the P.P. Corps a hindrance. 
But the party and its most glamor- 
ous agency had become firmly 
welded in the public mind and 
must stand or fall together. Allan 
had been informed^ by Siggi Wilson, 
P.P. Corps administrator, that it 
was vitally important that the 
original decision regarding the 
dwarfs’ intelligence be proved 
correct. Unfortunately, to date 
he had no proof that would enable 
him so to rule.

T he five men and three women 
finished their meal and started 
drifting into the common room for 
the night’s entertainment. The 
director had brought some new 
Tri-D tapes. 

“Going to watch the Olympics 
with us. Conscience?” asked Mar- 
garete Olmedo, a pretty, olive- 
skinned girl who had been more

than casually friendly toward Allan 
during his short stay. 

He was tempted. He had put 
in a long day crouching in his blind 
and whether or not he liked sports 
was immaterial— the tapes showed 
Earth. But he also needed to start 
extracting the Figures that were 
going to build to an inconclusive 
statistic, and tomorrow he wanted 
to get an early start and construct 
an observation post near the female 
dwarf that had attacked him. She 
had launched herself from an over- 
head branch when he had made a 
move toward the hidden cave and 
it was not simply a coincidence 
that when he had hurled her away 
from him she had landed against 
the opening. Regretfully he 
declined. 

In the small cubicle that had been 
assigned to him Allan sat on the 
foamfab bunk and patiently as- 
sembled his data into class orders. 
He ran a preliminary analysis in 
all classes for central value and 
compared the result with the 
established intelligence scales used 
by all P.P.’s. As he had expected, 
the dwarfs were a borderline case 
with a slight bias on the lower 
side. Apparently the previous 
Conscience had been influenced by 
the creatures' biological classifica- 
tion as hominids and their demon- 
strated competence. Allan could 
not believe his predecessor had seen 



the hidden grotto and its god 
figure — the air of untouched antiq- 
uity had been too strong. 

Borderline was not good enough 
—according to P.P. guidelines 
intelligence had to be positively 
demonstrated. Allan sighed and ran 
a comparison check between his 
own data and the refined statistics 
gathered by station personnel and 
correlated by Magnitsky. The two 
were almost identical when ob- 
tained under similar conditions. 
Unless the more detailed studies 
were faked, which seemed highly 
improbable, Magnitsky’s case was 
practically proven. 

The idea of delaying a decision 
until after the next election occured 
to Allan, but he discarded it 
immediately. The commitment of 
mankind to the avoiding of old 
errors had to be considered a 
lasting one, not subject to changing 
conditions, to mean anything at 
all. 

Zwergwelt had a nineteen-hour 
day and he worked through half 
the short night before tumbling 
into bed. He slept dreamlessly 
until called for breakfast. 

He lingered over a second cup 
of stimcaf with Magnitsky, who 
was preparing to leave. The aged 
scientist seemed to have something 
on his mind. Finally he pulled a 
flimsy from a pocket and said, 
“I received an interesting rumor 



60 



IF 




on the daily activity report from 
Main Base this morning, Allan. 
The word is out that you’re sched- 
uled to leave for Earth and become 
Siggi Wilson’s deputy administra- 
tor. Also that you just might break 
a short tradition and replace Wil- 
son when he retires next year.” 

Magnitsky chuckled. Allan re- 
alized his face must have shown 
his surprise. The present deputy 
administrator was leaving and 
Allan had been offered the job, 
but the thought that he might be 
groomed to replace Wilson was 
new. In its short life the Corps 
had had three administrators, all 
of them retired space service 
general officers. Since the Corps 
was a semi-military agency and 
all accredited agents held reserve 
rank in the space service, the short 
tradition had seemed likely to be- 
come a long one. 

What Magnitsky could not know 
was that Allan planned to decline 
the promotion. He has signed up 
for the P.P. Corps at its inception. 
In his sixteen years in the field, 
eleven as a Conscience and the 
last five as one of three sector 
chiefs, he had found a life more 
rewarding than anything crowded 
Earth had to offer. He liked 
spending three-quarters of his 
time in spaceships. And while 
gathering data on a subject 
species was often dull and tedious 



it also offered unique adventures, 
high moments of excitement and 
danger, the thrill of discovery, 
that no desk-bound job could 
possibly match. 

The two men shook hands and 
Allan slipped on his backpack. 
At the door he was stopped by 
Victoria Gant, who asked where 
he would be if they should need 
to reach him. 

“I’d rather not take a chance 
on your disturbing the subject 
under observation — except for an 
emergency,” he told her. 

“Understood. But there may be 
one. 

Allan showed her the low cliff on 
his terrain map. An hour later he 
was sitting on top of it, hidden 
behind some bushes near the edge. 
The tallest trees reached well above 
the limestone outcropping and 
he patiently scanned their upper 
levels with binoculars. He located 
the female dwarf in ten minutes. 
She had built her nest in the second 
tree away from the edge, slightly 
below the cliff top. 

The thick brush at the cliffs 
edge provided an adequate shield. 
Allan settled down to observation. 
This female had no children and, 
like the males, spent most of the 
morning napping and occasionally 
eating fruit. At noon she left and 
made a circuit of what was 
obviously her territory, but re-

turned for another nap. Allan 
began to wonder where the dwarfs 
got their muscular power — like 
male lions in the wild, they re- 
ceived hardly enough exercise to 
stay alive. 

B y the time. Pollux sank 
slowly toward the green hori- 
zon Allan was entertaining the 
hope that Victoria would send 
someone after him. It would stir 
the female into activity— she might 
exhibit protective behavior if 
strangers approached the cave. 
But nothing had happened when 
it came time for him to leave. 
Allan donned his pack and crept 
backward until he could rise and 
walk down the gentle slope to the 
north. 

He reached the game trail that 
led toward the station and started 
along it, mulling over the obviously 
high but unrealized potential of 
the dwarfs. For some reason he 
felt listless and tired, as though 
drugged by fatigue. He could think 
of no reason for his weariness — 
he had spent most of the day lying 
on the ground in reasonable com- 
fort— but the feeling persisted and 
grew stronger as he walked. 

Some instinct developed by a 
thousand brushes with death on 
primitive worlds alerted him to 
danger. He looked around care- 
fully and saw nothing unusual, 



but the uneasy feeling persisted. 
There was an abrupt bend just 
ahead in the trail and without 
conscious intent his hand drifted 
to the laser in his belt as he started 
around it. 

And then he saw the waiting 
human female. She wore a black 
hood with a front panel that hid 
her face. 

“Just stand there,” a voice said 
almost beside him and Allan turned 
to see a pistol barrel covering him 
from the shadowed bush. There was 
a crackling of brush from the 
opposite side and a second armed 
and black-hooded figure emerged. 

“Who are you? What do you 
want with me?” Allan demanded. 

“You will know shortly,” said 
the female who had waited in the 
trail and Allan could not repress 
his startled surprise. The voice 
was muffled by the hood, but he 
was almost certain it belonged to 
Victoria Gant. 

She turned and started back 
down the trail and one of the two 
men removed Allan’s laser and 
gestured for him to follow. He 
experienced a slight dizzy spell, 
but recovered and walked after her. 

The masked woman led the way 
toward the station at a brisk walk, 
but turned into an intersecting trail 
after less than a kilometer. Allan 
had to force himself to meet her 
pace. Two hundred meters down 



62 



IF 




the new trail she turned into the 
brush. Allan followed for a short 
distance, the ^wo guards at his 
elbows, and emerged into a grassy 
clearing bordered on one side 
by a small swift river. Three other 
masked figures, one of them a 
woman, were sitting on the grass 
a few meters from the bank. 

When he stopped walking Allan’s 
legs almost betrayed him. He sat 
down and rested a moment, then 
looked up at the woman and said, 
“This is an odd game — and I 
don’t really want to play.” 

“It is not a game and your 
participation is mandatory,” the 
woman replied, her voice cold. 
“This is a Safeguard Squad, 
Conscience Odegaard.” 

Allan felt a small thrill of 
horror. He had heard the vaguest, 
most fleeting rumors about a 
secret society recently active on 
the outlying worlds and the word 
“Safeguard” had been whispered. 
He had not believed the rumors 
or put credence in hints that the 
recent deaths of two Consciences 
had been something more than the 
accidents they appeared to be. The 
thought that some of the people he 
knew and worked with- could don 
masks and become killers was 
insupportable. The horror he felt 
now was not for his own safety — 
it came from the realization that 
the unacceptable was true. 



“I have heard of you, but only 
vaguely,” he said aloud. “Tell 
me more.” 

“In good time. Conscience. At 
the moment we have more urgent 
business. Please sign this.” 

She extended a single page. 
Allan took and read it in the 
gathering twilight. It was the usual 
preliminary report filed over the 
subradio when a Conscience 
reached a decision — it imitated 
his writing style reasonably well. 
It stated that the dwarfs of Zwer- 
gwelt were definitely below the 
minimum intelligence level and 
that the decision of the previous 
Conscience was reversed. Zwer- 
gwelt was to be opened to full 
colonization. Allan’s name and 
rank of sector chief had been 
typed in. 

“I may very well file a similar 
report when I’m satisfied it’s the 
truth, but not before — and I’ll 
never sign under duress,” he said, 
handing it back. 

“You will sign — and promptly,” 
said the voice he now was certain 
was Victoria’s. “I have a hypnotic 
and its antidote in this medical 
case. If I must I will drug you, 
order you to sign and then admin- 
ister the antidote. But in your 
present weakened condition the 
double drug dose might be fatal. 
I advise you to sign.” 

“Why are you trying to force 



THE DWARFS OF ZWERGWELT 



63 




me when this is probably the 
decision I’m going to reach any- 
way?” he asked. 

“Even if you were willing to 
overrule your mistaken predeces- 
sor, which we doubt, you made it 
perfectly clear in talking to Magnit- 
sky that you intend to delay a 
decision until it’s too late to 
affect the coming elections. We 
can’t wait. This will be just what 
the New Romans need to throw 
the idiot Conservationists out of 
power at long last. Now sign - 
or take your chances with the 
drugs.” 

She again extended the paper 
to Allan. He shrugged, accepted 
it and signed. As he handed it 
back Allan said, “I don’t under- 
stand the rules of the game. What’s 
to prevent me from repudiating this 
the moment I reach a subradio?” 

“If you are found innocent of 
Crimes Against Mankind in the 
trial you are about to undergo 
you will be kept isolated in a 
nearby cave until after the elec- 
tion,” said the woman, her voice 
even and very formal. “If found 
guilty as charged — you will be 
executed.” 

T he horror came back, prick- 
ling at the skin of Allan’s 
forehead. He had been seconds 
away from death on many occa- 
sions and had been frightened 



every time. But now it was not 
fear that sent cold chills down 
his back — it was the knowledge 
that he was dealing with self- 
appointed executioners. These 
people were willing to sit in judg- 
ment of him for what they alone 
considered crimes. He had thought 
such barbarism gone from human 
society — today it was a recognized 
form of insanity. 

Victoria slipped the report into 
her jacket. In measured tones she 
said, “Conscience Odegaard, you 
are charged with Crimes Against 
Mankind— specifically, with for- 
bidding the colonization of doz- 
ens of worlds perfectly suited for 
human growth and expansion. You 
may speak in your own defense and 
I shall appoint a counselor for you. 
I suggest you take time to consult 
with him before the trial begins. 
I warn you fairly. If you are con- 
victed by this jury—” she swept 
a hand toward the woman and two 
men who had been waiting for 
them — “you will be summarily 
executed. This is not a game, 
as you referred to it earlier — 
for you the situation could hardly 
be more serious.” 

Allan raised a hand. “A moment 
ago you referred to my ‘weakened 
condition.’ How did you know I 
was not feeling well?” 

A short laugh came from behind 
the black mask. “The salve Vic- 



64 



IF 




toria Gant used on your wounds 
yesterday contained a new drug, 
discovered here on Zwergwelt, It 
acts slowly and weakens without 
killing. We had already planned 
to take you prisoner today and 
the drug lowered your ability to 
resist.” 

Allan was so physically weak it 
was ^n effort to hold his head 
erect. His mind was clear, though, 
and he caught the illogic at once. 
“Then you had intended to force 
me to sign that false report even be- 
fore you heard the conversation 
with Magnitsky. Right, Victoria?” 

There was a short silence. Then 
she said, “Your guess as to my 
identity is not important— think 
just what you wish. And yes, we 
had planned to take this action 
even before we overheard the 
conversation that gave away your 
intentions. But enough talk. The 
jury and I will withdraw. The man 
on your right is the prosecutor. 
I appoint the one on the left as your 
counsel. The trial begins in ten 
minutes and I repeat — if found 
guilty you die. Prosecutor, you 
may move out of hearing distance. 
I think he is now too weak to run.” 

The man on Allan’s right 
followed Victoria and the two 
stood talking in low tones a few 
meters away. The other one turned 
to Allan and said, “Conscience, 
this trial is real, not just an excuse 



to execute you. If we win you’ll 
be kept on the drug for a couple 
of months and released after the 
elections, just as the judge said. 
What you do then won’t matter 
because our friends will be in 
power. Now, the best way to beat 
this charge is to show what you’ve 
done for Mankind to counteract 
the bad. I’ve read the folder on you 
and it shows many cases in which 
you ruled ‘questionable’ species un- 
intelligent, opening up several 
worlds to colonization. We’ll 
throw those at the jury.” 

“Are you saying I can’t defend 
the work of the P.P, Corps in 
totoT" asked Allan. 

“Certainly not. That’s a sure 
way to lose. The Corps as a whole 
has done more to hold Man back 
from his rightful place in the 
galaxy than any organization in 
history. Some muddle-brained 
Consciences and their bleeding- 
heart supporters have ruled us 
away from worlds that could be 
colonized tomorrow. And why? 
Because some dumb animal just 
might develop intelligence a mil- 
lion years from now! That’s what 
the Safeguard Squads have been 
organized to fight. Conscience. You 
know as well as I do that we need 
those worlds. But look, let’s save 
it for the jury. Will you do this 
my way?” 

“For the moment,” Allan agreed. 



THE DWARFS OF ZWERGWELT 



65 




His body felt as if it had been 
ravaged by a long illness, but he 
still thought clearly. Evidently the 
drug did not effect the nervous 
system. And his defender, probably 
one of the station personnel, 
sounded sincere. Night would fall 
in a few minutes. Allan had already 
decided to play for time— if he 
could overcome his debilitating 
weakness he might find a chance 
to escape. 

T he defense counsel called 
to the judge and prosecutor. 
Allan struggled to his feet and 
walked slowly toward the jury 
near the riverbank. His appointed 
attorney followed and the other 
two moved to intercept him, but 
slowed when they saw he was 
making no effort to escape. Allan 
stopped in front of the woman 
and her two male companions. 
He noted that he was now less 
than fifteen meters from the water. 

“The court is now in session,” 
Victoria said. “Is the prosecution 
ready? And the defense?” 

The two men mumbled an as- 
sent— apparently neither was 
accustomed ta his role. Allan had 
been studying the three jurors 
in the fading light and was con- 
vinced the second woman was 
pretty Margarete Olmedo. The 
two women at the local station who 
had been kindest to him were co- 



conspirators. He was equally 
certain he had not met the two 
male jurors. Something in the 
way they moved — they displayed 
the easy but sure physical re- 
actions of men accustomed to 
changing gravities — said space 
service. Allan had a sudden grim 
hunch that one of those two 
would play a second role if the 
verdict were guilty — that of execu- 
tioner. And if he enjoyed such 
tasks, which seemed likely, there 
was little chance he would vote 
for acquittal. 

The prosecutor began his presen- 
tation and Allan listened carefully. 
The first words might have been 
lifted directly from a hot speech 
by a New Roman politician— 
they created a familiar blend of 
fact, prejudice and distortion. 
The diatribe was directed not as 
much against Allan as against the 
Conservationists in general and 
the P.P. Corps in particular. The 
charge that the Corps had denied 
human access to hundreds of 
worlds was accurate. It was also 
true that no species had been 
found with a civilization compar- 
able to Earth’s. Man was appar- 
ently alone in the galaxy and it 
was ridiculous and wasteful to 
refrain from relieving Earth’s 
burdensome population when the 
means of transport and the empty 
worlds were available. The Con- 



66 



IF 




servationists had taken advantage 
of mistaken idealism — and the 
gullibility of billions of voters to 
maintain their hold on power — at 
a cost to the future development of 
Man that was incalculable. Since 
they had succeeded in duping a 
majority of the voting public until 
now, a group dedicated to operat- 
ing in secret for the benefit of 
Mankind had been organized. It 
supported the New Roman party 
but was not a part of it. The 
Safeguard Squads were its en- 
forcement arms and had the 
vested power to bring known crimi- 
nals to trial and execute sentence 
upon them. 

The last few items were not part 
of the New Roman dogma, but 
Allan felt certain higher-up party 
officials must be aware of the exis- 
tence of the Safeguard Squads. It 
was hard to operate in space with- 
out the active connivance of some 
members of. the space service 
hierarchy. Allan felt a sudden 
numbness of spirit when he re- 
membered encountering, the year 
before, a brigadier general who 
had tried to have him killed. At 
the time he had thought the incident 
an isolated one, the work of a 
frustrated officer nearing retire- 
ment who was willing to swap his 
honor for high political office. Now 
he was not so certain. The general 
had been forced out of the service. 



but had been immediately ap- 
pointed to a functionary’s post in 
government. The New Romans 
were either actively supporting this 
extralegal society or passively 
condoning it. 

Darkness had fallen. The judge 
produced a light and placed it on 
the grass, focused on Allan. Behind 
the glare Victoria Gant became a 
dim and lumpy figure, squatting on 
crossed legs. Only the prosecutor 
and defense counsel stood. 

“Your honor, I have a question 
of legality,” Allan said when the 
prosecutor finished. “Am I to 
understand that the only possible 
punishment in the event of a 
guilty verdict is death? Why are 
there no lesser sentences? And if 
someone is found innocent, what 
keeps him from reporting you to 
the officials?” 

After a short wait Victoria 
answered and it was obvious she 
was speaking carefully. “There 
have been only two trials to date 
and both accused were found 
guilty. If found innocent they would 
have been placed on one of the 
habitable worlds their own people 
caused to be isolated. As for the 
death sentence’s being the sole 
penalty for guilt, 1 would like to 
remind you that killing a Con- 
science is the one crime for which 
the space service is authorized to 
hold a field trial and execute upon 



THE DWARFS OF ZWERGWELT

conviction. It seems only fair that 
you be subject to the same penalty.” 
“Thank you for the enlightening 
comparison, your honor.” 

“The jury will note the defen- 
dant's remarks. Defense counsel?” 
Allan’s counsel said, “I’m happy 
to be able to defend Conscience 
Odegaard — he is certainly one of 
the better members of his club. I 
can name at least a dozen worlds 
where he made the decision that a 
questionable species was unintelli- 
gent, opening the way to coloniza- 
tion. A recent one was Beauty, 
where he overruled one of his 
fellows and declared the planet 
okay after the stupid idiot had 
ordered the colonists off. He forced 
one of our friends in the space 
service to retire on that deal, but 
at least we got the planet. On 
Misery — not one of the better 
planets for sure — he gave permis- 
sion for the local spice processing 
company not only to continue its 
work but to expand. The company 
is supposed to leave later, when the 
humanoids there develop a little 
further. Even on many worlds that 
he ruled ineligible for colonization, 
like the silicon-life planet Crystal, 
he okayed the installation or expan- 
sion of scientific stations. I 
maintain that his record as a 
Conscience is unusually good and 
that he should be spared and freed 
after the election.” 



“The defense counsel makes 
some good points,” said the 
prosecutor without waiting for 
judicial permission to speak. 
“Odegaard is admittedly one of the 
less soft-headed members of his 
profession. But 1 deny that his 
record is really that great— he 
has followed the standard line in 
ruling humans off any world where 
the local animals could so much as 
throw stones. If he is less guilty 
than most, it’s strictly a matter of 
degree. I say we have no choice 
but to find this man guilty as 
charged.” 

The defense counsel took a step 
forward and began a rebuttal. Both 
men had become wrapped up in 
their role-playing and were working 
hard — each seemed equally sincere. 
For the first time since the start of 
this wild trial Allan could almost 
believe that it was real. 

The two court opponents argued 
for almost an hour. Zwergwelt 
had no moon and a light mist in 
the air hid the stars. Allan had been 
squinting away from the light for 
some time to accustom his eyes 
to darkness. He felt he had rested 
enough to be capable of at least a 
short spurt of explosive action. 

“The jury will vote immediately, 
since we judge by majority decision 
and consultation is not permitted,” 
,said the judge, picking up the light 
and swinging it toward the three 



68 



IF 




seated figures. “All who vote 
‘guilty’ please raise your right 
hand,’’ 

One hand, that of the man on the 
left, shot up immediately. Allan 
guessed that he was staring at his 
intended executioner. The other 
man made no move. Margarete 
hesitated, started to raise a hand 
and then nervously lowered it. Her 
agitation was apparent even 
through the shielding hood. The 
judge waited a moment. AlJan 
thought he heard relief in her voice 
when she finally said, “Vote noted. 
All innocent, same sign.’’ 

The man on the right raised his 
hand and the woman followed 
suit. The one on the left muttered 
something under his breath. 

“The verdict is innocent,’’ said 
Victoria, her voice neutral again. 
She swung the light back to Allan. 
“Conscience Odegaard, you will 
be held in custody for sixty days 
and then released, provided we win 
the election. I am sorry we must 
detain you . .’’ she went into a 
lengthy apology, but Allan was no 
longer listening. 

H e dove for the light, snatched 
it up, rolled to his feet and 
hurled it at the left-hand juror. It 
caught the man in the face, knock- 
ing him down, then spun into some 
low growth. In the sudden darkness 



Allan stiff-armed Victoria, sending 
her sprawling, and ran for the 
water, crouching and zigzagging. 

A laser beam, aimed low, flashed 
past his legs. Allan threw himself 
at the ground, hit rolling, scram- 
bled to his feet and hurled himself 
forward in a long flat dive. In 
midair he felt a surge of weak- 
ness so overwhelming he almost 
blacked out. The sudden tremen- 
dous exertion against the deadening 
effect of the drug had brought him 
to the edge of physical collapse. 

The third laser beam burned him 
across the left thigh as his head hit 
water. 

He felt the shock of the wound 
even through the faintness. The 
water was unexpectedly cold and 
jarred him back to full conscious- 
ness. Momentum carried him into 
the strong central current and he 
felt it pulling him down. He vented 
his breath slowly and managed a 
feeble stroke or two to keep him- 
self under. Even that small effort 
brought blackness washing back 
over his mind. He hovered on the 
verge of awareness for a long 
moment, and then felt air on his 
face — his still inflated lungs had 
brought him back to the surface. 
He emptied them and sucked in 
air in a great gasp. Light swept 
over his ^ead, came back and a 
laser beam burned the air a few 
centimeters in front of his eyes. 



THE DWARFS OF ZWERGWELT 



69 




The water beyond exploded into a 
cloud of steam. 

He managed a feeble stroke that 
took him down, but again lost 
his hold on consciousness. For a 
timeless interval he hovered in the 
grip of shadows, eyes closed, 
moving as the current took him, 
and again broached the surface. 
The light found him immediately, 
but from farther away. When the 
laser beam came it boiled the 
water where he had just ducked— 
he felt the heat before the current 
dragged him away. 

When he came up for the third 
time he was past the point where 
the light was effective. The ac- 
cumulated need for air was so 
great he had to take several deep 
breaths. The mist had lifted and 
bright starlight revealed that the 
fast water had taken him around a 
bend. 

The sound of someone crashing 
heavily through the brush reached 
Allan from the near bank and he 
managed a few strokes to push 
himself farther out. He had sub- 
merged by the time the light swept 
the surface again. This time he 
managed to stay down for almost 
a minute and when he came up 
again he knew he was safe. 

It took a minimum of effort for 
him to keep afloat in the swift but 
smooth current. Allan gingerly felt 
over his burned leg and for the 



first time discovered he was bleed- 
ing heavily. The beam had taken 
away some upper muscle tissue 
was well as skin. Function seemed 
unimpaired, but the wound was 
nasty. 

After another half kilometer a 
natural eddy swept Allan toward 
the bank. He recognized the area 
and realized there was a place of 
refuge close at hand. When his feet 
touched bottom he fought the 
current to stand erect, finally 
staggered ashore. The effort 
spent him again and he had to 
lean against a tree. When he re- 
covered he went on, hoping he was 
not leaving a bloody trail in the 
grass. He had no idea how long it 
took him to reach the rocky hill 
and the limestone cliff. If the fe- 
male dwarf was now on the prowl 
she would find an easy victim. But 
only the noises of the smaller ani- 
mal population disturbed the night 
and he found the rock face and its 
concealed cave with no difficulty. 

After carefully pulling the vines 
together behind him Allan 
struggled up the slight incline to 
the grotto. In the pitch darkness 
inside he sat down and finished 
ripping off the trouser leg partly 
burned by the laser. Unable to 
make a tourniquet, he compro- 
mised by wrapping the cloth 
tightly around the wound, placing 
his left palm over it and lying with

IF 




the weight of his body on the hand. 

Instead of sleep he felt the 
familiar black fingers again 
closing around his mind — he must 
have lost a lot of blood. His 
imprisoned hand was swiftly 
growing numb and Allan could 
not tell if the bleeding had slowed 
or was carrying him toward death. 
But he knew with absolute cer- 
tainty that he could not rise from 
the powdered limestone floor, 
that he must live or die on what he 
had managed to that point. The 
blackness deepened and Allan 
surrendered his hold on life and 
let the fingers pluck him up and 
cast him into a wider, stronger 
river, where he floated toward a 
more lasting darkness. 

HI 

iipT£Y ALLAN TRUE- 
Jn HEART, wake up there." 

He opened his eyes and shrank 
back from the incredible coun- 
tenance bending over him. The 
huge flattened lips that extended 
ten centimeters beyond the lumpy 
nose twisted into a grin. “Come 
on, Keeper-of-the-Earthman’s- Bur- 
den, on your feet. We’re going for 
a little walk." The voice was high 
and peremptory, hauntingly famil- 
iar to Allan. What he saw he could 
not believe. The rough clay statue 
had come to life and was kneeling 



beside him, one crude arm extended 
to help him up. 

Allan closed his eyes to the night- 
mare, but it refused to go away. 
Instead he felt a large hand pulling 
him up and he reluctantly rose to 
his feet. The effort made his head 
swim and he staggered — only the 
supporting clay arm kept him from 
falling. He opened his eyes again, 
and saw that the little circular 
cavern was lighted by a dim blue 
radiance. He glanced at the roughly 
outlined face towering a foot above 
his head — and quickly looked 
away. The sight was unacceptable 
to the senses. He had to be 
delirious. 

“Come on, fella, let’s take a little 
stroll and say hello to your friends 
in the Safeguard Squad. They’re 
looking for you." 

One grainy arm moved across 
Allan’s back and a huge hand 
clasped him under the right arm- 
pit. As the ponderous body urged 
him forward he instinctively grip- 
ped the supporting shoulder and 
was partly carried to the low 
tunnel. The living statue had to 
stoop to miss the ceiling. As they 
walked down the gentle slope 
Allan felt the rough clay under his 
hand. The surface did not move and 
shift to indicate internal muscular 
activity. With thumb and fore- 
finger he tried to pinch off some 
material but could not.

“Leave off trying to steal my 
corporeal substance there, fella," 
said the slightly high but pleasant 
voice that Allan knew from long 
ago, but still could not place. They 
reached the vine curtain and care- 
fully maneuvered through it. 
Pollux was almost overhead, its 
yellow rays highlighting another 
day on a nearly perfect world. 

Allan had revived slightly, 
though dizziness was a constant 
menace, waiting a chance to 
pounce. He recognized the now 
familiar effect of the drug as a 
deep and abiding lassitude, but he 
was also feverish and not fully 
recovered from the shock of a 
serious wound. As he and the statue 
started through the woods, moving 
faster in the open, the exertion 
brought blackness swirling toward 
him. Just before it hit Allan finally 
remembered why the statue’s voice 
was familiar. 

“Clay," he gasped. “Clay 
Forrester—" And then conscious- 
ness retreated and hovered, taunt- 
ing him, just outside his skull. 
When the dark clouds lifted his 
companion was chuckling aloud. 

“Straight on, fella, straight on. 
This is of Clay talking, or at 
least his personality as you saw 
it when you knew him." 

“But — but why?" Allan asked, 
feeling helpless and lost. “If you 
aren’t human — ’’ 



“You’d have a hell of a time 
communicating with me in my 
elemental form, junior. And that 
would be a pretty good yuk if you 
understood it, ’cause it happens I 
am an elemental. And I chose 
Clay’s personality out of the 
several I could have formed from 
your memory ’cause this body 
I’m activating is made of the stuff 
and that’s just the type of campy 
joke he’d like. It also fits in with 
the fact I’ve got to lay a few heavy 
words on you, and Forrester 
never dug anything more than 
displaying his superior erudition. 
So just call me Qay." 

That description of his former 
college friend was accurate 
enough. Allan remembered Clay 
with fondness, though he had an 
exasperating affectation of using 
colloquial horrors of speech that 
had enjoyed a brief popularity and 
then died into history. Clay had 
remained a reacher when Allan 
joined the P.P. Corps and, to the 
best of Allan’s knowledge, had 
carved out a successful career for 
himself on Earth. 

They had reached the game 
trail and Allan heard voices around 
a bend ahead— one was Victoria 
Gant’s. 

“Yeah, they’re lookin’ for you, 
daddyo," said Clay, the wide flat 
lips grinning in earthy mockery. 
“Stand to the side and I’ll hide us 



72 



IF 




by casting a spell that'll dazzle 
the minds of men." 

N ightmare or delirium, 

the experience was terri- 
fyingly real. Allan clung to a sturdy 
bush and waited. Clay standing by 
his side. Victoria and two men 
Allan did not recognize rounded 
the bend. These strangers had to 
be the male members of the jury. 
One had a plastiskin strip across 
his forehead. As they passed, the 
bandaged man turned and looked 
directly at Allan, In two cold and 
remote gray eyes Allan read a 
lingering fascination with— and 
hunger for inflicting on any prey 
available— the finality of death. 
A hunter’s madness. 

Up to this point Allan had ac- 
cepted the unacceptable with 
numbed acquiesence. When the 
killer looked through him and 
continued to search the woods on 
both sides, it finally became too 
much to bear. He waited until the 
three hunters had passed out of 
hearing and said, “1 can’t believe 
this any more.’’ 

Clay chuckled, a light, pleasant 
sound. “It took a pretty good 
tolerance for you to come this 
far, dad. But brace yourself — the 
worst is yet to come." 

“If you can keep them from 
seeing us,’’ Allan said slowly, 
“can’t you do something about my 



physical weakness? Lend me some 
of the strength you’ve got animat- 
ing that clay figure?’’ 

“Could, but ain’t gonna— want 
you just as you are for reasons of 
mental health you’ll understand 
better later. Let’s follow your 
dedicated friends for the moment. 
And go ahead and talk— they 
can’t hear us.’’ 

They stepped into the trail and 
started after the three humans. 
“Who are you?’’ Allan demanded. 
“Or what are you?’’ 

“I told you what 1 am, Allan— 
an elemental. We were around be- 
fore your ancestors swung that 
first bone club and will be here 
after your descendants have 
mutated themselves up the ladder. 
But just to keep from making this 
too simple, only a small part of my 
consciousness is in this sloppy 
form supporting you. Most of it is 
back on the old home grounds, 
Mother Earth and environs” 

“God is a concept alien to — ’’ 
Allan began. 

“Naw, that’s too simple also, 
Allan, baby. There’s nothing 
anthropomorphic about me in my 
basic form.’’ 

It was too much. Allan’s logic 
and reason failed and his trained 
mind was useless. And then with 
a flash of insight he saw his way 
clear — and accepted the fact he 
was dealing with matters beyond 



THE DWARFS OF ZWERGWELT 



73 




logic and reason. A soft chuckle 
came beside him and he realized 
that Clay was reading his thoughts 
as they formed. 

“Yeah, keerect, dad. Logic and 
reason do have to be expressed, 
though, before you can place me 
in context. Not even I can follow 
the subprocesses that eventually 
produce a mental verbalization.” 

For a moment Allan had man- 
aged to forget his physical weak- 
ness. He was reminded when 
dizziness again assailed him and 
his legs abruptly buckled. Clay 
supported him without slackening 
his pace. After some moments of 
foot-dragging the spell passed and 
Allan could walk again. 

“I think I’ve made the quantum 
jump,” he said aloud. “Okay, 
I’m in a new universe. But I’m lost. 
Guide me.” 

“That’s what I’m here for. Tell 
me, Allan, when you were a small 
child and looked at the sun, what 
did you see?” 

Allan thought for a moment, then 
said, “A big white ball in the sky 
that hurt my eyes.” 

“And when you were a teenager 
in Preparatory — what was the sun 
then?” 

“A mass of gases heated by 
atomic processes in a central core, 
the source of all energy in the solar 
system and probably of all matter. 
The sun was an incredibly complex 



mechanism and only specialists 
understood it in depth.” 

“And when you became to a 
degree a specialist during your 
astronomy courses in college?” 

“I moved from external large 
basics into fundamentals, more 
details. I learned how and why the 
hydrogen-into-helium fusion pro- 
cess works, how other elements are 
created, the complete life cycle of 
a star. I also learned there’s a 
great deal we still don’t know and 
may never know.” 

“Right. And during these years 
that was the same sun sitting out 
there, not changing to any ap- 
preciable degree. Your grasp, 
your understanding of it changed. 
Now as to what I am — you’re just 
at the small child stage, Allan. 
You’ve got a long way to go to 
reach Preparatory, much less 
college.” 

“Then you’re a higher intelli- 
gence? I’ve found a more advanced 
life form than man — you?” Even as 
he spoke Allan realized his words 
sounded distorted, as though they 
missed the real point. 

Clay sighed. “No, damn it. I’m 
above intelligence and evolution. 
Those concepts are meaningless 
when applied to me. I told you — 
I’m an elemental, as much a part 
of Earth and the sun as the 
gravitic force that binds them 
together. Use the previous analogy 



74 



IF 




but substitute intelligence for the 
sun and you’ll have a better idea 
of what you really know on the 
subject.” 

That hurt. Allan found his reason 
rebelling, but the conviction that 
he had just heard an unyielding 
truth slowly swelled and grew until 
it overwhelmed him. His voice 
was dull when he finally acknow- 
ledged the bitter fact. “Then — my 
life has been wasted. I’ve special- 
ized in the study of intelligence 
and made hundreds of decisions 
that vitally affect entire species 
—based on what I thought we 
knew.” 

“Wrong again. When the sun 
hurt your eyes you learned as a 
child not to stare directly at it— 
that was learning by immediate 
personal experience. In school you 
switched to new learning techni- 
ques, the manipulation of symbols 
and concepts. The process lost im- 
mediacy, but the volume of learning 
grew tremendously because of the 
nature of the working medium, 
the ability of symbolical represen- 
tation to condense tremendous 
amounts of knowledge into forms 
that can be quickly absorbed. In 
dealing with intelligence. Homo 
sapiens is still in the personal 
experience area and is going to be 
there for some time. You learn as 
you grow, doing the best you can 
with what you know at the partic- 



ular moment. You can't refuse to 
act simply because you know a 
deeper understanding will come 
after you’ve advanced to an en- 
tirely new technique of knowing 
and learning.” 

T he changes in Allan's personal 
orientation were coming too 
rapidly, were too profound for 
absorption. He had not yet fully 
accepted the testimony of his senses 
about the reality of what was 
happening. 

“Then why are you telling me 
about heights I’m never going to 
reach? What do you want?” 

“Well, laddiebuck, now that 
we’ve cut the watermelon rind we 
get down to the juicy heart. You’ve 
finally strayed from the straight 
and narrow by making a wrong 
decision and you’re about to com- 
pound the error by following it with 
a second one. I’m here to change 
your mind on both, if that can be 
done without actual interference. 
We elemental have our own rules 
—there’s no such thing as total 
freedom anywhere in the universe 
—and one is that we don’t interfere 
with ‘lower’ iffe forms. Sound 
familiar? But if you choose a new 
path when we finish our walk, 
especially considering that you’re 
not going to believe this conversa- 
tion tomorrow anyway, then I 
haven’t bothered you any more 



THE DWARFS OF ZWERGWELT

than your research stations bother 
the dwarfs. And to hit ’em in 
reverse order, that’s the second 
wrong decision you’re about to 
make, that our short look-alikes 
aren’t intelligent. They are.” 

“Not as 1 understand intelligence 
at my child’s level,” said Allan 
stubbornly. 

“Technically and temporally 
you’re quite right, but you’ve got 
a short-term perspective. I was on 
this planet about forty thousand 
years ago for reasons that are none 
of your business. At that time the 
dwarfs would have passed your 
tests. Your own ancestors were 
scavenging carrion for a living 
back then, incidentally. That’s 
when these long-toothed shorties 
made this statue of the form I took. 
1 kinda’ liked it and told the clay 
to hang together. Then this world 
warmed up a little and turned 
entirely too lush. The result was 
that earning a meal became too 
easy and the dwarfs regressed. 
All they really need are some hard 
times and those are coming within 
a thousand of their years. This 
continent is going to dry out and 
wrinkle up like an old apple. Five 
thousand years after that they’ll 
be finding some of your artifacts 
and writing learned papers on the 
unexpected metallurgical abilities 
of their primitive ancestors.” 

“I don’t have any choice but to 



accept that— as I accept you — ” 

They had caught up with Victoria 
and her two companions, who were 
standing at the river’s edge, 
discussing the possibility that he 
had survived the swift water. He 
learned they knew the laser beam 
had caught him and considered it 
likely he had drowned. Two other 
squadsmen had launched a raft 
upriver and were poling it toward 
them, searching the banks for his 
body. 

Allan had reached a temporary 
equilibrium between drug and 
fever and for the moment was 
having no difficulty clinging to 
consciousness. 

“What’s the first mistake, the 
one I’ve already made?” he asked 
the hulking figure beside him. 

Clay sighed again. “Now we get 
down to the real nitty-gritty, 
Allan. Brace yourself, ’cause you 
ain’t heard nothin’ yet.” 

Allan had already heard more 
than enough, but he tried to 
compose himself to accept the 
worst. 

“You've already made a firm de- 
cision to reject that deputy admin- 
istrator’s job,” Clay said slowly, 
apparently picking his words with 
care. “You did this for a purely 
selfish reason — the fact that the 
life you lead now is a hell of a lot 
more exciting and interesting than 
anything Earth can offer. I want

IF 




you to change your mind. The P.P. 
Corps will need you in that top 
spot when Siggi Wilson leaves and 
with all its faults it’s a good organi- 
zation. Some of my fellow elemen- 
tal in other systems— including 
this one — want the work you’re 
doing to continue. And on the 
personal level — you’re about 

spoiled for field work anyway. 
Take the bigger job and quit while 
you’re ahead.” 

The world turned dark again for 
Allan, but this time he recognized 
the encroaching blackness as a 
frantic defense against believing 
what he had Just heard. He forced 
back the tempting oblivion. 

“What do you mean I’m spoiled 
for field work?” 

“I’m sorry this has to be hard to 
take, Allan, but keep in mind that 
the cut a surgeon makes to operate 
could kill a man if that were the 
intent. Instead it’s the first step in 
the healing process. You have more 
than a touch of arrogance in you. 
It’s a common fault of the compe- 
tent. With all the good intentions 
possible, you’re beginning to think 
and act too much like these Safe- 
guard cats looking for you — like 
a man who knows for sure he’s 
right. It’s a dangerous and unfor- 
giving attitude. I think you’d 
better move on up the ladder and 
let a younger and more idealistic 
person take your place.” 



Clay turned and began walking 
back down the trail, still supporting 
Allan. “I don’t think they’re going 
to find you in my little hideaway 
and when the fever eases you won’t 
have much trouble getting food 
and water. They’ll be guarding the 
shuttle from Main Base next 
week, but you should manage to 
sneak aboard somehow. Com- 
petency is a virtue as well as a vice. 
In any case, it’s your problem.” 
Allan was silent on the short trip 
back to the cavern, trying to 
digest what he had learned. It 
was too much to be absorbed at 
once. Being on his feet for almost 
an hour had finally drained his 
strength, and he was losing his 
precarious hold on full conscious- 
ness. Despite the confusion in his 
mind he remembered at the cliff- 
side to ask a final question. “How 
will I find you on Earth? You 
can’t just show yourself to us and 
then disappear. Where are you in 
our solar system?” 

Clay chuckled. “Man, you’re 
centered on the geographical and 
temporal location bit — look, dad, 
I don’t want you hunting for me 
and this little conversation has to 
be strictly confidential — not 
that anyone would believe you 
anyway. Mankind has to grow 
up to us — not just find and try to 
exploit us. Think about that. And 
when you recover remember this as 



THE DWARFS OF ZWERGWELT

just a vivid fever dream, where 
maybe you gleaned a few pearls 
of wisdom from the submerged 
iceberg part of you.” 

They passed through the vine 
curtain and it was the last thing 
Allan saw for two days. 

H e awoke to a knowledge 
of serious bodily dehydration, 
but his mind was clear and the 
fever had run its course. He 
staggered outside, hoping that 
the female dwarf was not at home. 
After drinking from a forest pool 
and eating some thoroughly ripened 
fruits he felt much stronger and re- 
turned to the cavern. In the dark- 
ness he made his way to the clay 
figure at the rear and carefully 
felt over it. The statue was as 
lifeless as when he had first 
examined it, but seemed to have 
shifted its position slightly. With 
only memory to guide him he could 
not be sure. Without a light he 
could not even check the floor for 
large flat footprints, nor could he 
find the source of the blue light he 
remembered had illuminated the 
cavern during his fever experience. 
Still, he had not the slightest 
doubt of the reality of the 
experience. 

Four days later he crouched 
behind a thick bush only a few 
meters from the charged fence 



protecting the station. The aircar 
from Main Base was just settling 
to the ground and Allan saw with 
approval that it was going to 
shield him from the laser-armed 
gardener working at the rear of 
the building. When the pilot step- 
ped outside and was also hidden 
behind the aircar, Allan picked 
up the heavy stile he had made and 
walked rapidly to the fence. 

Without cutting tools or power 
Allan had been forced to use 
dead branches and vines to con- 
struct the inverted-V stile, but it 
would get him over the two-meter 
high wire. He held it by one leg 
and carefully manhandled the other 
over the top strand. Each leg had 
lashed side braces to hold it erect. 
He moved carefully up the vine- 
tied crosspieces and had just 
reached the top when a low voice 
called, “Nice try. Conscience.” 

He froze, then slowly turned, 
keeping his hands carefully in 
sight. The out-of-uniform space 
serviceman with the murderer’s 
eyes was standing a few meters 
away, laser rock-steady on Allan’s 
chest. 

The two men looked at each 
other. In the coldly controlled face 
below him Allan saw all he needed 
to let genuine fear show on his 
face. The killer drank it in, his 
mouth opening slightly. When he 
began to smite in anticipation 



78 



IF 




Allan hurled himself to the side in 
horizontal dive over the fence. 

He felt the burning touch of 
death in the air above his ribs. 
He landed on top of a young green 
bush, his next course of action 
already thought out. 

It took five seconds for a small 
laser crystal to cool between 
pulses. Three of those were gone by 
the time the breaking branches had 
cushioned Allan’s descent to 
the ground. He had curled into 
fetal position during the last stages 
of his drop and he landed almost 
on his feet. He left them again 
instantly in another long dive into 
a shallow ditch he had spotted from 
the stile. Briefly out of the killer’s 
sight, he opened his mouth and 
yelled. 

A surprised face appeared in the 
nearest window of the aircar. The 
face of his intended executioner 
rose simultaneously above the 
top of the stile. The man hesitated, 
looking from Allan to the copilot 
of the aircar and back again. He 
seemed to realize it would be 
impossible for him to hide the fact 
of naked murder. He stepped 
down from the stile and silently 
faded into the woods. 

For a moment Allan remained 
where he was. The copilot of the 
aircar had swung to the ground 
and was approaching him at a trot. 
Allan recognized him as Jacques 



Flomain, the civilian flyer who had 
delivered him here two weeks 
before. He was carrying a laser in 
one hand. 

Jacques kept his gaze on the 
quiet woods outside the fence and 
called, “Run for the aircar. 
Conscience — I’ll cover.” 

On a world where a Safeguard 
Squad existed and at least two 
space servicemen out of uniform 
roamed at will and one killed 
on command, it was impossible to 
know friend from foe. Allan had 
planned to try to reach Magnitsky, 
of whose honesty he felt certain, 
without trusting another person. 
Now he had to chance Jacques’ 
and the other pilot’s being 
trustworthy. 

Jacques had advanced to the 
head of the shallow ditch, where he 
stood with his pistol pointed at 
the woods. Allan pushed erect 
and, crouching low, ran for the 
far side of the aircar. 



DON’T understand,” 
X Magnitsky said sharply. 
“You’re sure the masked judge 
was Victoria. Yoii are reasonably 
sure one juror was Margarete 
Olmedo and you think you know 
both the prosecutor and your 
assigned ‘counsel.’ Why won’t 
you prefer charges?” 

“Lack of any proof better than 



THE DWARFS OF ZWERGWELT 



79 




my word against theirs,” replied 
Allan, The aircar pilots had 
brought him to Main Base im- 
mediately and were seated in 
Magnitsky’s comfortable office. 
“Besides, my prosecuting Victoria 
and her immature crew would only 
make them happy. Fanatics are 
always willing to ‘die’ for their 
‘cause,’ not that these people would 
draw anything like a death penalty. 
1 think it was Wilhelm Stekel who 
said it best two-hundred Eryears 
ago: A mature man wants to live 
humbly for what he believes. If 
you had been at the trial you’d have 
seen how little Margarete and 
Victoria wanted to kill me, even 
though the roles they had adopted 
have forced them into it. 1 suggest 
you transfer all of them back to 
Earth, where they can work for the 
New Romans in legitimate ways. 
I’m more concerned with the space 
service officer responsible for 
those two roving ‘jurors.’ After 
the election we have to start rooting 
out the bureaucrats and officers 
who support these extralegal 
activities.” 

“Of course I’ll send Victoria and 
the rest back if you won’t prose- 
cute,” said Magnitsky. “In the 
past I’ve had some reservations 
about the mission of the P.P. 
Corps, but now that I see what 
would happen if exploiters like the 
New Romans took power. I’ll 



certainly vote Conservationist.” 
“So will a few billion others when 
Earth hears about the Safeguard 
Squads,” said Allan, rising. “And 
1 am filing charges against the 
two spacers. We can’t have 
killers like that gray-eyed fellow 
roaming loose. Service HQ is 

preparing a gallery of all military 
personnel assigned to this solar 
system and I’ll point out the ones 
1 saw unmasked. We have 
Flomain’s word to back mine on 
the ambush at the fence. From 
those two the Inspector General 
can work his way up.” 

They shook hands, Allan headed 
for the landing field, where a 

planetary shuttle waited to lift 
him to the neverlander just 
entering orbit overhead. At the 

entrance port he paused for a last 
look at the lush and verdant 
woods of Zwergwelt, wondering 
how often he would be able to 
escape his new office and walk 
again through such primeval 
beauty. Not frequently, once the 
bureaucracy got him in its grip. 

Allan gazed in the direction of 
a small hidden grotto, where a 

crude clay figure sat in lonely but 
majestic splendor. There was still 
no doubt in his mind of the 
authenticity of his experience 
there. “I hope to God you’re 
satisfied,” he murmured and 
entered the shuttle. •

At last the 



DAVID MAGIL 




N O ONE knew when it had 
started — some time in pre- 
history — and it had never stopped. 
It had always been, had always 
gone on. The only pauses had been 
for moving. When the destruction 
had become too great for Tyne the 
same positions were set up on 



Skoob. Skoob had protested, so 
the armies had moved to Semreh 
— and then it had been the planet 
Drith and then Narb, Adnap, 
Raeb and on and on from planet 
to planet, farther and farther from 
Tyne, from home. And no one 
knew how it had started, no one 



83 





knew why they were Tighting, no 
one knew any way to end it. No 
one but Sergeant WaDyTyne. 

He was not with his troops. He 
had deserted them. He was crawl- 
ing along a jungle path, five hun- 
dred yards in front of his front 
lines. He had gone. mad. He kept 
telling himself so. It was necessary 
that he be mad. Otherwise all hope 
was lost. He told himself that he 
was simply insane, had been 
driven insane by the years on the 
island, by the war. He crawled 
along slowly, hoping and praying 
that he had lost his mind. If he 
had, he thought he might do some- 
thing. If not— he knew that he was 
going to die. 

He was out alone for the first 
time. It was terrible. He knew the 
jungle temperature was suffocat- 
ing, yet his blood felt as if it were 
freezing. But he kept moving. He 
had to keep moving. 

If he were right— if he had lost 
his reason— he would end every- 
thing. He would end the war. 

The smells of the jungle were 
nauseating— they were the odors 
of death, of rotting and of killing. 
Crawling, listening, trying not to 
let the sound of his breathing be 
heard, he slowly inched along. He 
had to do it. Even if he failed he 
had to try. Even if he failed because 
his commanders were too stupid to 
take advantage of what he planned. 



But they would not let him down. 
After centuries, after millennia, 
the one thing they were all poised 
to do was take advantage of ad- 
vantage— any advantage. 

He moved along. He hadn’t 
thought about his path. He hadn’t 
allowed his brain to think of any- 
thing. He was a raving lunatic. Be- 
cause of that he would do what 
was necessary. He would have 
only minutes, but minutes would 
be enough to at last end the war. 

He held his breath. He heard the 
Zytynes. They were directly in 
front of him. He waited, listened. 
Had they heard him? They had 
not. They were still talking. 
Slowly he regained his breath and 
then, very silently, slithered 
around and crawled past the 
Zytyne advance point. 

He was going to do it. He knew 
he was going to do it. Because he 
was mad. But was he behaving 
madly? No. Crawling was sane. 
He should not crawl, not if he 
truly had gone mad. But if he 
stood they would shoot him down. 
Or would they? 

H e stood up and waited for 
the blast that would kill him. 
None came. He walked upright 
and then remembered that no one 
walked upright. He let himself 
slouch and stumbled along. At 
first he forgot about stumbling, 



84 



IF 




but then he remembered. This was 
not a smart army — neither army 
was smart. No one stayed in a 
state of war as long as these men 
and remained military. So he 
slouched and he stumbled and 
kept on the path, not off it. 

The night was dark. He kept 
his eyes lowered. He had trouble 
breathing, but he made himself 
breathe. He walked through them. 
He rubbed shoulders with a patrol 
going out. No one said anything to 
him. He went on. He stumbled, al- 
most tripping over a Zytyne with 
dysentery. The soldier swore at 
him. But he kept moving, past 
them, away from them, into them. 
He kept getting closer. 

And then he saw it. 

It was housed in the big dome. 
He had never seen theirs before. 
But it was the same. Both sides had 
the same. 

He thought about going into the 
jungle again, getting it from the 
rear, but then he reminded himself 
that he was not sane. He walked 
straight toward it. He took a gre- 
nade out of his belt and pulled the 
pin. Only his thumb kept the fuse 
from going. If he had to go with 
it, he would. He was crazy. But he 
was going to end the war. 

The guards were just doing a 
normal sentry pattern. He took his 
gun out and held it ready. He 
would try to get as close as he 



could. All he had to do was knock 
it out, jar it. Even a few minutes— 
just minutes— would be enough. 

He was going to do it. He 
actually was going to do it. 

He kept walking — the crouching, 
stumbling, weary walk of a soldier. 
A hundred yards to go. No chal- 
lenges yet. Seventy-five yards. He 
really was going to make it. Fifty 
yards. Twenty-five yards. No 
challenges. 

He was going to take out their 
War Machine. 

There were eight billion Tynians. 
The War Machine had them all on 
tape. The War Machine could pre- 
dict an attack as fast as one could 
be planned. The War Machine 
could counter a counter-attack as 
fast as one could be mounted. All 
through history neither army had 
ever advanced, had ever gained an 
advantage because of what the War 
Machine knew. It knew the brain 
patterns of every Tynian who had 
ever been born. 

Twenty yards. Even if he stopped 
or was shot down he was close 
enough. He was close enough to 
stop the machine for a second. 
Just a second, maybe — but even a 
second would be enough. 

“There’s a truce on, Dy.” 

He froze. 

“There’s a truce on. You want 
to blast, go ahead. But there’s a 
truce on,” the sentry said to him. 



THE WAR MACHINE 



85 




“I got here," WaDyTyne said. 
“You lost. Even if you hit me I’ll 
take it with me. I fall, it goes. 
Look." 

“I know. You think we haven’t 
been watching you? The readout 
said you’d be here." 

“No!" . 

“Sure. You know you can’t beat 
it. Nobody ever has." 

“What else did it say?" 

“You’re a sergeant. Stupid 
Dytyne name, Wahrdytyne or 
something. Said you’re pretending 
you’re mad. Look. The truce just 
went in. We’re supposed to tell you 
that we’ll provide transportation 
back to your lines." 

He knew it was so. The War 
Machine knew. The War Machine 
always knew. 

“Look. The thing said you’re 
not going to blast. Here, walk on 
up to it. Go in if you want." 

He looked at the sentry. It was 
so, but it wasn’t so. He believed it, 
but he couldn’t believe it — he 
didn’t want to believe it. He walked 
right up to the dome. If he lifted 
his thumb. If he just lifted his 
thumb, standing right there. 

“Why a truce?" 

“I think it’s over. Your guys and 
our guys are having a big staff 
conference on it: Right now." 

“A staff conference? Together?" 

“The way I heard it there was a 
revolution back home." 



“So?" 

“So they decided, it’s not worth 
it. The new guys don’t want the 
war any more." 

“You’re lying." 

“Listen. Do you hear any fight- 
ing, any artillery? There hasn’t 
been any in a long time now." 

“It’s over?" 

“Yeah. The way I hear it, it’s 
over." 

“We’re going home?" 

“No, Dy. Not home. They 
don’t want us." 

“I don’t understand." 

“Too expensive and they don’t 
think we could reintegrate. No 
carriers to take us home. They’re 
not going to send any carriers for 
any of us." 

“What are we going to do?" 

“The War Machine is trying to 
figure it out." 

“Yeah? Look. If you’re not ly- 
ing, you’ll let me go in." 

“Go ahead. Hey, and call out 
what it says, huh? I can’t leave my 
post, truce or no truce. You 
know?" 

H e went inside to the read- 
out screen of the not very big 
machine. He recycled the printer. 
And then, still holding his thumb 
in place of the grenade pin, he 
carefully watched. 

The War Machine was still. The 
printout read: 



86 



IF 




IMPOSSIBLE REJECT REJECT RE- 
JECT NOT POSSIBLE REJECT RE- 
CYCLE RECYCLE RECYCLE UNDER- 
STOOD 

And then there was a gap. 

He waited and watched the 
screen. It wasn’t a gap. There was 
nothing. He pushed the accelerate 
lever — it was clearly marked on the 
control panel. Nothing happened. 

“What’s it say,” the sentry 
shouted in. 

He got up and slowly walked 
outside. 

“It says that it understands. 
Maybe it’s dead. Maybe peace 
kills them. Maybe it’s really over,” 
he said, troubled, upset, searching, 
finding, pulling the pin from his 



pocket and slowly, carefully fitting 
it back into the grenade’s safety. 

“You know what I think,” the 
sentry said. “1 think we’ll get 
back.” 

“How’s that?” 

“First we take this planet and 
we use it to hop one step closer 
and then the next planet and then 
the next. Maybe a thousand years, 
but we’ll get back.” 

“And then what? 1 know. We 
land back home at the Spaceport 
and set up our positions and then 
our War Machine goes up against 
the other War Machine. 

“Never thought of it like that. 
Makes you wonder. Maybe that’s 
the way the whole thing started.”#

THE WAR MACHINE 



87 






88 




A BLOW was coming. Tleth 
tasted it in the pre-dawn wind 
that hissed across the top of the 
dune, snapping his robe and flat- 
tening it against his thin reptilian- 
looking body. It would reach them 
tonight at the latest, he judged — a 
full ripsand. 

He looked south, scalp furrowing 
in displeasure. Dakshan was still 
more than a day away. He should 
never have agreed to take the pas- 
sengers, If the caravan had been on 
schedule to Moveen instead of 
off-routing to leave polesman 
Kreesh and his shes at Dakshan, 
it could have sheltered in scale- 
rock hills by midday. Now it faced 
the chance of meeting the blow in 
open desert. 

Below him the shiffeners were 
starting to unroll and make the 
first meal over their fire pots. The 
hobbled shiffen spread beyond 
them, long heads and necks snaking 
out in search of the wiry clumps 
of dune grass. Kreesh and his shes 
still slept, three bright humps of 
fabric on the sand beside their huda 
and packs. 

Tleth stared broodingly at the 
scene, tasting the wind again, then 
plunged down the dune in a slide of 
sand and pebbles. 

“Rig up,” he shouted. 

The shiffeners turned heads, yel- 
low eyes querying. 

“Ripsand coming,” Tleth said. 



Their elliptical pupils dilated. 
They scrambled to unfasten hob- 
bles and clip reins to the nose rings 
of their animals. The reptiles tried 
to dodge, hissing shrilly in angry 
protest. Their long tails lashed at 
the shiffeners with vicious accuracy 
and an occasional broad foot struck 
out as it was unhobbled. 

Tleth toed Kreesh. 

“Wake up.” 

The polesman rolled over and 
sat up blinking groggily. 

“Caravanmaster,” he muttered 
in greeting. 

“Get your shes ready to travel.” 

Kreesh peered at the sky. 

“It isn’t yet dawn,” he com- 
plained. 

“We’ll need every extra hour if 
we’re to make Dakshan before the 
blow.” 

“Blow?” Kreesh stiffened. “A 
bad one?” 

Tleth suppressed a hiss. As 
though any other kind would con- 
cern an experienced caravanmaster. 

“I doubt my caravan and I can 
withstand it in open desert — cer- 
tainly neither you nor they can,” 
Tleth replied, jerking his head 
toward the shes peeking sleepily 
from under their hoods. “We leave 
as soon as we have our meal.” 

The caravanmaster turned away, 
trying to hide his dislike of Kreesh 
only because the latter might mis- 
take it for prejudice. 



90 



IF 




Tleth did not subscribe to the 
belief that just because the pole 
tribes had vestigial scales on their 
scalps and spines in contrast to the 
smooth yellow skins of mid world 
tribes, they must necessarily be 
backward and barbaric. But neither 
would he respect any male irre- 
sponsible enough to bring egg- 
heavy shes across the desert in 
blow season. Kreesh must be aware, 
even coming from the quiet deserts 
of the poles, that if the shes were 
brought to nest out here there 
could be no protection and any 
wind above a stirsand could erode 
the shells before they hardened. 

T he protests of the shiffen sub- 
sided gradually as the animals 
resigned to being loaded. A few 
tails still lashed, but sullenly, no 
longer aimed at any target. Tleth 
checked each animal, making sure 
the load was balanced and the rig 
straps lying flat between the shiff s 
spines. He paid particular attention 
that the two halves of the huda were 
secured snugly and that the padding 
was unwrinkled between them and 
the shifPs hide. Only when the cara- 
van was ready to travel did he 
accept the mug Shiah, his head 
shiffener, poured for him. 

Normally there would have been 
conversation and joking in this 
pause before the day began. Today 
they washed down biscuits and 



hurriedly packed the pots. Kreesh 
and his shes were lifted into their 
huda and the shiffeners scrambled 
onto their animals, into the space 
at the junction of the reptile’s neck 
and trunk. 

The caravan moved out in a long, 
shambling line. Tleth set the course 
and a pace as fast as the shiffen 
could manage at this temperature 
and let Shiah maintain it while he 
ranged his more lightly laden shiff 
back along the line, keeping it in 
order. He checked the sky often. If 
they kept moving they might have 
a few hours’ margin to make 
Dakshan. 

Dawn came not long after they 
left the sleeping ground. The sky 
had been lightening gradually 
along the horizon but there was 
no more prelude than that. Sud- 
denly the sun was there — small, 
white and bright. 

The shiffen felt the heat almost 
immediately. Tossing their heads, 
they hummed softly in welcome. As 
their blood warmed they were 
able to move faster and a few, feel- 
ing good, nipped at animals ahead. 

Tleth moved in to break up an 
impending fight between a bull and 
a castrate who mistook the male’s 
playfulness for amorous advances. 
The caravanmaster snapped his 
lash at the castrate’s sensitive muz- 
zle. The reptile hissed but straight- 
ened around in line. There was no 



CARAVAN 



91 




need to discipline the bull — he was 
busy licking the gouge the cas- 
trate’s teeth had left on his neck. 

“Watch him,” Tleth told the 
shiffener in line behind the bull. 
“Get between them if he acts up 
again.” 

W "ITH day and warmth the des- 
ert’s pre-dawn quiet vanished. 
Small reptiles appeared on the 
dunes to sun themselves or hunt 
smaller creatures in quick, darting 
chases. Flyers swooped through 
the sky to circle above the caravan 
with a beat of leathery wings and 
occasional hoarse cries. Tleth 
watched them. Flyers meant the 
air masses were still not too 
turbulent. When the dhanzals and 
ganra grounded, it would be time 
to hunt cover. 

As the morning passed and the 
heat increased, the color of the sky 
paled until it was bleached nearly 
the same gray-white as the sands 
beneath it. But otherwise it re- 
mained clear. Even the horizon 
was unmarked by clouds or sand 
spouts. 

“Are you sure there’s a blow 
coming?” Kreesh asked irritably 
when Tleth paused beside him 
briefly. 

The caravanmaster regarded him 
without expression. 

“Yes.” 

Beyond Kreesh, in the other half 



of the huda, the shes rode silently, 
their faces set against the jar of 
every step. Tleth’s mouth thinned 
as he studied them. If he had seen 
them before he accepted Kreesh’s 
money, he would never have agreed 
to take them. How could the poles- 
man be so insensitive? 

“If you’re worried about making 
Dakshan, why don’t we cross those 
flats rather than follow the dunes?” 
Kreesh demanded. 

Tleth did not bother to look in 
the direction the other was pointing. 

“Those flats are sink sand,” he 
said. 

One of the shes sat up in 
astonishment. 

“All the area?” 

“Most. It is the main reason 
blows are so dangerous here,” 
Tleth explained. “Sandwaves are 
quite common with the greater 
winds.” 

The shes paled. Even Kreesh 
looked uneasy. 

Tleth regretted frightening the 
shes. To distract them, he pointed 
out a long gray mound like a very 
low dune in the middle of the sink 
sand. 

“I don’t believe you have tarrays 
at the poles. They’re species of 
swimmer, but larger than any you 
have. They are^ the biggest animal 
in the world.” 

The shes stared wide-eyed at the 
gray shape. 



92 



IF 




“How big?” one asked. 

“That one is about a hundred 
meters long. I’d estimate. Average 
for the species. The jets are closed 
but if you look closely just above 
the sand you can see its body fin 
moving to keep it on the surface. 
They come up several times a day 
to sun and saturate their blood 
with oxygen. This one will probably 
dive again soon.” 

They regarded it with caution. 

“Will it attack us?” 

He shook his head reassuringly. 
“No. Tarrays prefer the sink areas 
to the denser sand of dunes and 
normally eat just small swimmers 
and burrowers. We have to worry 
only if we make so much noise 
it thinks its territory is being 
invaded.” 

As he spoke the tarray rippled 
once and sank out of sight, leaving 
a fine spray of sand in the air be- 
hind it. A wave slid along the sur- 
face in the direction the tarray had 
taken, diminishing quickly until 
only expert eyes could distinguish 
any motion in the sand. 

Tleth glanced at the shes. They 
were watching, fascinated, their 
discomfort momentarily forgotten. 

“Will it come up again soon?” 
one asked. 

“Probably not, but another may. 
This sink is large enough to support 
many tarrays. You’ll hear it first, 
a rumble like thunder. Then the 



ground will begin to shake and—” 
“Tleth!” came a shout. 

T he caravanm aster looked up. 

Shiah was waving at him. 
Tleth flicked his shifPs neck with 
his lash, pushing it into a rough 
trot, and rode forward to his head 
shiffener’s side. 

“Trouble,” Shiah muttered, 
pointing with his lash at dhanzals 
circling to the south and east of 
them. 

Tleth’s forehead wrinkled. 

“It could be another caravan,” 
he said judiciously. 

“No ganra,” the shiffener 
pointed out. 

The small flyers were fond of 
mites that commonly infested 
shiffen hides. Wherever shiffen 
were, ganra appeared. The furrows 
in Tleth’s forehead deepened. 

“So we may assume we’re being 
tracked by raiders.” 

“Must be desperate to be out 
now.” 

“Or clever. Their timing has 
certain advantages, provided they 
have shelter somewhere near,” 
the caravanmaster said. “No one 
in Dakshan will worry if we don’t 
arrive before the blow. And by the 
time it occurs to someone to search 
for us after it, no signs will be left 
of where we were attacked or of the 
shiffen taken. Our bodies would be 
in the sink.” 



CARAVAN 



93 




“What shall we doT’ Shiah asked 
calmly. “We can’t group and fight 
with that ripsand coming. And if 
they’re riding zhazen we can’t 
outrun them.” 

TIeth twisted to look back over 
the caravan and at the horizon 
behind them, then quickly scanned 
the desert around them. Caught 
between raiders and a blow, one 
made defense against the other all 
but impossible. All but. He rubbed 
a neck spine on his shifT absently. 
There was one possibility. 

“We can increase their difficulty 
in attacking us,” he said slowly, 
weighing the danger, “and maybe 
cut the distance to Dakshan in the 
process.” It was not an ideal solu- 
tion. A^ny other time he would not 
even have attempted it with shes 
along. “We’ll cross the sink.” 

Shiah’s pupils dilated, but he 
nodded in acknowledgment and 
turned his shiff away from the bot- 
tom of the dunes toward a narrow 
gray strip stretching out into the 
slightly paler sink sand. 

The nearest shiffener behind 
him sat up in alarm. 

“What — ” he began, staring at 
TIeth. 

Silently the caravanmaster 
pointed out the flyers across the 
dunes. The shiffener’s question 
died and he guided his animal after 
Shiah. 

TIeth was not worried about his 



shi^eners. Not all ranked as mem- 
bers' of his regular crew but all had 
had enough caravan experience to 
confine themselves to handling 
their animals, trusting the caravan- 
master to route them safely. 

Kreesh was the one who might 
try to cause trouble. 

T LETH took his shiff alongside 
the passengers before they no- 
ticed the new direction. 

“We’re taking a cut route,” he 
told them in his most casual voice. 
“It’s across the sink but there’s; no 
danger. There are avenues where 
the grass holds the surface together 
enough to support our weight.” 
“Then why haven’t we crossed 
before?” Kreesh asked with a flash 
of suspicion. 

It was time for lie number two. 
“Because we couldn’t bed down 
on it. There are too few safe areas 
large enough.” 

The polesman did not look con- 
vinced but TIeth could not spend 
more time on him. The caravan- 
master had no intention of men- 
tioning the raiders. He wanted 
very much to avoid the undesirable 
effect stress often had on shes so 
close to nesting. 

In the sink there would be only 
two possible directions from which 
the raiders could attack. Three 
guards should be enough to with- 
stand them initially two at the 



94 



IF 




back, another up front, in case the 
raiders found a path into the sink 
that intersected the caravan route. 
Zahl and Hriss were excellent with 
skims, he remembered, and he had 
heard that Manth, new this trip, 
was also good. 

Reining bade his shiff, he paced 
it briefly beside each of the three in 
turn while he explained the situa- 
tion in short terse sentences. They 
fell out of line obediently and took 
position, Zahl and Hriss at the 
rear, the new shiffener up with 
Shiah. Unobtrusively they reached 
back and shifted their skim pouches 
from the customary carrying place 
under the edge of the rig frame to 
easier access inside their robes. 

Tleth regarded them with satis- 
faction. The raiders would not find 
it easy taking the caravan now. 
Nothing surpassed skims as weap- 
ons when thrown by strong, accu- 
rate arms in open-sand combat. 
The raiders would have skims, too, 
of course, but they would have to 
ride in attack, not ambush the 
caravan from stationary positions, 
and their accuracy would be spoiled 
by the fast, choppy gait of their 
zhazen. 

The avenue of firm sand nar- 
rowed as they followed it deeper 
into the sink. At points it would 
have crowded two riders abreast. 
Tleth edged bis shiff into line just 
ahead of Zahl. 



He looked back at the dunes they 
had left. The dhanzals had not yet 
changed position. It would take 
the raiders a while to realize the 
caravan had changed course, but 
then they would waste no time 
altering their plan of attack. He 
fully expected to see them appear 
behind before a handsbreadth of 
the sun’s passage. 

From the dhanzals his eyes AiA 
almost automatically to the north- 
ern sky. Still clear. Or was it? 
Tleth squinted. He thought he 
made out what might be a trace of 
hazing just at the horizon. 

Facing front again, Tleth whis- 
tled shrilly. Far ahead, Shiah 
twisted around inquiringly. The 
carav^nmaster made a snapping 
motion with his wrist. 

Acknowledging with a wave, the 
shiffener flicked his animal with 
his lash. The reptile’s narrow head 
snaked irritably. Shiah touched it 
again. It flung its head up, then 
broke into a reluctant trot. One 
by one the shiffen in line behind 
it also changed gait. Tleth knew 
they could not sustain the pace very 
long but he reasoned that a tired 
shiff was minor compared to the 
other hazards abounding in the 
desert today. 

He watched the line ahead 
closely. A trot was not the ideal 
gait for control of the leggy rep- 
tiles. Not that he could help if one

got into trouble; the avenue here 
was too narrow. 

W HAT he feared was not long 
in happening. One loose 
shiff, its stride longer than that of 
the animal ahead, overtook and 
rammed into the other. The one in 
front came around hissing. It also 
swung out and stepped backward, 
gathering for a charge. The thinner 
sand at the edge crumbled under its 
weight, dropping its hindquarters 
into the sink sand. 

Tleth whistled but the signal was 
unnecessary. The shiffeners in line 
nearest the stricken beast vaulted 
off their animals and raced to its 
aid. Grabbing the edge of the rig 
frame on each side, they pulled, 
shouting and whistling encourage- 
ment to it. The shiff scrabbled with 
its forelegs, heaved forward and 
dragged its hindquarters back onto 
firm sand. It was shoved back into 
line and the shiffeners climbed 
again onto their mounts. The line 
stretched briefly into a fast trot 
until it caught up with the rest, 
who had not stopped. 

Tleth wished he could feel re- 
lieved. Instead he found his eyes 
raking the surface of the sink sand 
repeatedly. How much subsurface 
vibration had the shifFs struggle 
caused? He saw Zahl also looking 
out across the sand, forehead 
deeply furrowed. An irregular 



movement up the line told the 
caravanmaster other shiffeners 
were doing the same. 

The shiffen sensed the increase 
in tension. Their heads swung un- 
easily and they rumbled deep in 
their chests. Shiffeners abruptly 
began soothing their animals be- 
fore the rumbles could become 
roars. Tleth whistled at Shiah- 
short blasts down-toned at the end 
that meant hold the line, keep them 
moving. 

“Tarray,” Zahl murmured. 

Tleth’s eyes followed his point- 
ing hand. Far out the sand rippled 
slightly. One of the big swimmers 
was coming to see what had fallen 
into its territory. In imagination 
Tleth felt the creature erupting 
beneath him but he resisted the 
urge to push his shiff into a run 
and carefully held it to an easy trot 
a tail's length behind the animal in 
front. 

He did, however, let himself 
watch the low wave that marked 
the tarray’s passage. It was headed 
straight for the spot where the 
shiff had fallen. While he watched, 
it slowed. It stopped completely 
several hundred meters out and 
waited motionless for several 
minutes. Finally stirring again, 
the ripple turnedi and began fol- 
lowing a course that paralleled the 
avenue of firm sand. 

Tleth let his breath out gently. 



96 



IF 




The tarray .was only curious, not 
defensive. It would stand off watch- 
ing them for a while or, more 
accurately, reading' the vibrations 
that came down to it from them. 
If the caravan did nothing to arouse 
its anger or make itelf appear a 
food source, the beast would even- 
tually leave. 

Until it lost interest, however, the 
creature made another problem for 
the caravanmaster to watch. There 
was a virtue in having so much to 
think about, though. He realized 
with some surprise that he had not 
worried about Kreesh or the shes 
for some time, 

H e checked the sky again. 

The change of color on the 
horizon was more pronounced; 
there was no question now. He 
whistled for Shiah to slow to a walk 
again. Why tire the shiffen now? 
Speed might be desperately needed 
later. 

Presently the avenue widened 
once more and he pulled out of line 
to ride forward beside Shiah. 

“How do you make our travel- 
age?“ he asked. 

“We’re on a much straighter 
course for Dakshan than the dune 
route,” Shiah replied. “We’ve 
probably cut the distance by a 
third.” He looked across at the car- 
avanmaster keenly. “We might 
make Dakshan by late afternoon. 



provided the avenue continues.” 

Tleth did not miss the emphasis 
on the last part of the sentence. He 
was only too aware that running 
out of path was the most prevalent 
danger in crossing the sink. 

“We’re reaching midday,” Shiah 
said, changing the subject. 

“We can’t stop. Keep the pace. 
Trot when you feel we can afford 
it.” 

“You’ll see to rations?” 

The stores were on Tleth’s shiff. 
Turning and kneeling on its back, 
he opened one of the packs. There 
was no way to brew drink but this 
would not be the first time they had 
eaten dry. He handed several bis- 
cuits and thin strips of dried panne 
meat to Shiah and Manth, then 
worked back down the line, giving 
each shiffener a like portion. He 
also shared with Kreesh and the 
shes, since their supplies were out 
of reach in their packs on another 
shiff. It was to be expected that 
the polesman would not have 
thought to hold out enough for the 
midday meal. 

Kreesh complained about hav- 
ing nothing to drink. Ignoring 
him, Tleth moved on. The shes, at 
least, he noticed, knew enough to 
be grateful for their portions. 

After Zahl and Hriss had been 
given rations, Tleth held out some 
for himself and began closing the 
pack. 



CARAVAN

“Is the tarray still watching 
us?” he asked as he worked. 

Hriss nodded. 

“It has moved farther out, but 
it’s there yet. And look what else is 
watching us,” he said. 

He gestured back along the ave- 
nue. 

Tleth looked only because he 
wanted to count. There were about 
a dozen beings in the group fol- 
lowing them, all mounted on zha- 
zen, as he had surmised. They did 
not seem to be hurrying, except 
as beings might who were anxious 
to reach cover before the blow. 
As they might be. Outwardly and 
at this distance, there was no way 
to differentiate them from area 
tribesmen. Until they came close 
enough for Tleth to see the weave 
pattern of their robes, he could not 
discount the possibility that they 
were merely Dakshas coming home 
from a hunt or a puberty rite. 

“Don’t show skims until you’re 
sure of them,” he said. 

“What if they just ask to pass, 
then attack when they can back 
the whole line against the edge of 
the avenue?” Hriss asked. 

“You’ll be able to study their 
robes before that.” 

“And if they’re wearing Daksha 
robes?” Zahl put in, 

“If in doubt knock down one of 
your shiffen and block the avenue. 
Pretend you can’t get the animal 



up. And call me. If they’re raiders, 
being stuck behind you while the 
caravan goes on will force them 
to take overt action.” 

“Such as sink skims in our 
throats,” Hriss said darkly,, then 
grinned, adding; “If mine don’t 
end in theirs first.” 

They watched the group gain on 
them. The small stocky reptiles 
the others rode were faster than 
shiffen and should be overtaking 
the caravan more quickly if the 
riders were intent only on finding 
shelter. 

Tleth reached back for the skims 
in his own shifTs load. The outline 
of the triangular blades in the 
pouch felt reassuring as he slid 
them into his robe. 

“Estimate they’ll overtake in 
half a handsbreath,” Zahl said. 

The caravanmaster agreed, 
frowning. 

“1 wonder why they’re waiting 
so long. I think I’ll look ahead.” 



W HIRLING his shiff, he 
flicked it into a fast trot. 
Passing the line quickly, he rode 
ahead of it down the avenue. He 
wished he knew more about the 
sink. His only knowledge of it came 
from two trips made as head shif- 
fener under another caravan- 
master years before. What advan- 
tage lay ahead that the raiders were 



98 



IF 




so carefully timing their overtake to 
use? 

It did not take him long to find 
his answer, literally run across 
it. The trap lay only a kilometer 
ahead. Swearing, he wheeled the 
shiff and lashed it back toward the 
caravan. 

“We run out of avenue ahead,” 
he snapped in reply to the inquir- 
ing lift of his head shiffener’s fore- 
head. “There’s a full twenty- 
meter break before firm sand 
resumes.” 

“We can’t go back,” Marith ex- 
claimed in dismay. 

“No,” Tleth agreed. “We’ll have 
to swim.” 

The two shiffeners stared. 

“Tleth—” Shiah began. 

“I’ve seen it done before,” Tleth 
cut in. Once, he added mentally. 
“Move out. Get these animals up 
there as fast as you can. Unrig and 
swim the shiff. Drag the rigs. Rig 
up again on the far side. And hurry. 
The raiders are going to overtake 
while we’re in the middle of the 
operation.” 

“The tarray?” Shiah asked. 

Tleth swore. He had forgotten 
that beast. He checked the distant 
sand. His mouth tightened. The 
tarray was moving out, finally 
losing interest, but that interest was 
going to revive quickly when the 
shiffen started thrashing their way 
through the sink sand. 



He thought fast. 

“Keep two men on each side, orie 
pair to unrig, the other to rig. 
They’ll send each shiff on as they 
finish. Keep moving. We’ll just 
have to try to get as many across as 
we can before the swimmer gets 
here.” 

The pupils of the men were so 
large only a thin rim of yellow re- 
mained around them. Even expe- 
rienced shiffeners rarely at- 
tempted anything as dangerous 
as this. But years of caravaning 
had made obedience a habit. Even 
if they had been terrified, as they 
might well be, they would do their 
best to carry out any orders their 
caravanmaster thought would get 
to their destination the largest 
number of animals and handlers 
and above all cargo. They lashed 
the shiffen into a trot and kept them 
at it until the end of the avenue 
forced them to stop. 

Tleth vaulted off his shiff, tore 
at the bujckles of the rig. With 
Shiah lifting from the other side, 
a quick flip cleared the cross straps 
of the spines. The rig landed heavi- 
ly on the sand behind tl^ reptile. 
They quickly repeated the opera- 
tion with Shiah’s and Manth’s ani- 
mals. Then Tleth tore the rarely 
used picket line out of his pack 
and threaded it through the three 
rigs, finally handing one end to 
Shiah.

‘‘Hang onto the shiffen’s necks,” 
he directed, “and keep as flat on 
the top of the sand as you can. You 
won’t sink far if you spread your 
body weight across a large area. 
Be sure to brush off the animals’ 
hides on the far side before you 
rig up.” 

The shiffen slid into the sink 
^rthore willingly than the shiffen- 
ers. Tleth remembered, from the 
other time he had helped swim a 
caravan, that their broad feet 
worked rather efficiently as fins. 
The animals left the end of the 
avenue, reaching out with their 
forelegs in powerful lunges. As 
they crossed the sink they gradually 
sank until only their necks, tails, 
and spines were visible. The necks 
and tails spread out to help keep 
them up while, as Tleth could tell 
from the violent motion of the 
spines near their shoulders, their 
legs were working hard. On the far 
side they scrambled up and shook 
themselves, much calmer than the 
anxious shiffeners they had dragged 
with them. 

Manth and Shiah pulled up the 
rigs, brushed off the shiffen and 
reloaded the beasts. Then Shiah 
tossed back one end of the line. By 
that time Tleth and another shiff- 
ener had the rigs off three more 
reptiles and the operation was re- 
peated. 

“Car a vanm aster ! ” 



T leth tried to ignore Kreesh’s 
annoying, strident voice. 
“Caravanmaster — I must talk to 
you!” 

Tleth sighed. Letting a shiffen- 
er take over his immediate 
chore, he stalked back to where the 
three passengers were standing 
beside their animal. 

“What are you doing?” Kreesh 
demanded. “A shiffener said 
we’re going to swim across the 
sink. Are you mad? You can’t ask 
us to do that, certainly not with my 
shes in their condition.” 

Tleth regarded the polesman 
icily through pupils drawn to 
hairline slits. 

“It’s a pity you didn’t consider 
their condition before dragging 
them out here,” he snapped. His 
voice thinned to, “You insisted 
on coming, however. That makes 
you subject to my orders — and 
you’ll obey like every other being 
in this caravan. Shiffen can’t swim 
carrying weight and I intend, above 
all else, to save my equipment and 
animals. Of course, if you don’t 
like my orders, if you prefer to stay 
here and wait for the raiders — ” 
“Raiders?” 

“ — coming behind us, I won’t 
try to prevent you from doing so. 
You have until we reach your ani- 
mal to decide.” 

“When did you — ” 

Snapping around, Tleth ignored 



100 



IF 




the polesman and marched away, 
robe billowing out behind him. 

He found he was no longer 
needed up front. The shiffeners 
understood what was to be done 
and were doing it as efficiently 
as though they swam every trip. 
Tleth was relieved and let them 
work while he kept the caravan 
moving up to the break. He paid 
no further attention to Kreesh, 
except that he did notice some 
time later that all three passen- 
gers were on the far side. 

Hriss yelled, “Raiders — “ 

The raiders were coming at a 
hard gallop. Tleth checked the 
caravan. Less than half was across. 
Resisting an urge to look for the 
tarray — there was nothing he could 
do if it were coming, anyway— he 
ran for the rear. 

“Dismount,” he called. “Send 
up your animals.” And as he 
reached them, panting, he added: 
“We’ll meet them. Try to hold 
them until the shiffen are over.” He 
reached into his robe. “I have ten 
blades.” 

“Ten,” Zahl said. 

“Twelve,” Hriss said. 

“Aim for riders.” 

They nodded. 

He looked over his shoulder once 
more to see how the swimming was 
progressing. The shiffeners were 
working frantically, jerking rigs 
off on one side, shoving shiffen into 



the sink, barely taking time to 
brush them off on the other side 
before rigging up again. There 
would be sore hides tonight from 
twisted straps and sand abrasion, 
Tleth reflected. He caught himself 
ruefully. Always the caravan- 
master. He faced back toward the 
raiders. 

Then he heard a distant rumble 
like thunder. The sand trembled 
slightly beneath his feet. 

“Tarray.” 

Zahn’s upper body moved wryly. 

“We might save half.” 

“All,” Tleth said firmly. He 
smiled thinly. He would use the 
tarray. “Aim for zhazen.” 

“On the ground their aim will 
be—” 

“Aim for their mounts/’ the car- 
avanm aster repeated. 

T he leaders were bearing down 
on them, sun gleaming on the 
blades in their hands. Tleth reached 
into his pouch. 

The skim was smooth and cool 
in his fingers. He drew back his 
arm, threw with a snap of his wrist 
and dropped to hands and knees on 
the sand. 

He felt the tug of a skim catching 
at his robe. The leading zhaze 
shrieked. It reared and staggered 
backward, three blades protruding 
from its broad chest. The rider 
jumped clear as the reptile crashed 



CARAVAN 



101 




sidewise. The rider braced himself 
to throw, then went down himself, 
one of Hriss’s skims in his throat. 

Tleth threw again. Another 
zhaze fell, this time into the path 
of two more riders. The reptile’s 
convulsive movements and scream- 
ing panicked the other zhazen. 
They shied, hissing. One stepped 
too close to the edge of the avenue 
and went into the sink with its 
rider. 

The stocky reptile was not built 
to handle itself well in such fine 
sand. Zhaze and rider went under, 
screaming and struggling uselessly. 

The shiffeners hit two more zha- 
zen. The animals were only 
wounded, not knocked down, but 
their fright and pain left them un- 
manageable. They bolted back- 
ward, compounding the confusion 
in the main body of raiders. A 
second zhaze went into the sink. 

A raider threw. Hriss gasped and 
folded, arms clutched across his 
stomach. Tleth reached for him 
with a free hand while snapping off 
another skim. This time the blade 
only sliced a raider’s shoulder and 
deflected, fell into the sink. 

The sand rumbled more notice- 
ably beneath the caravan. 

“Back,” Tleth ordered crisply. 

The raiders stiffened on their 
mounts, pupils dilating, throwing 
arms arrested in mid-motion. The 
caravan was forgotten. Skims were 



shoved abruptly into robes and the 
riders fought to control and turn 
their frantic, terrified animals. 

“Run,” Tleth said. 

Hriss managed only one step 
before his knees gave way. Zahl 
kept him from falling by grabbing 
him under an arm. Tleth and Zahl 
dragged the wounded being after 
the caravan. 

The last of the shiffen were 
ploughing through the sink, rigs 
dragging, driven by fear and the 
shouts of their handlers. The two 
shiffeners on the far side added 
their whistles, watching something 
beyond Tleth. 

The caravanmaster did not look 
to see what it was, simply ran faster. 

At the edge of the sink sand he 
and Zahl leaped out, Hriss between 
them. The sand slammed up into 
them, momentarily taking away 
their breath. They reached for the 
trailing straps of the rigs with their 
free hands and locked tight on 
them. They were dragged for what 
seemed hours, the sand filling their 
robes, eyes and noses and shaking 
as though about to engulf them. 

Tleth’s hand began to tire and 
his fingers slipped on the strap. He 
dug in his nails but the fingers 
slipped farther — farther — until the 
strap jerked completely out of his 
grasp. He snatched for it again. 

Instead of the strap, however, 
he found another hand. It hauled 



102 



IF 




him forward and up, onto firm 
footing again. 

The rumble was growing louder. 
Tleth wiped his eyes clear and 
looked back. On the other side of 
the gap the sand erupted. A violent 
gray-white fountain sprayed into 
the pale, glaring sky, carrying 
zhazen and riders with it like so 
many insignificant pebbles. While 
the caravanmaster watched with 
grim satisfaction, the huge form of 
the tarray emerged from the sub- 
siding sand to investigate the 
strange invaders of its territory. 

“I thought it was headed for us,” 
a shiffener said weakly. 

“It was,” Tleth said, shaking 
sand out of his robe, “until the 
wounded zhazen distracted it.” 

AUTOMATICALLY he checked 
xV the sky again as he spoke, but 
this time he did not simply make 
note of its condition in passing. He 
saw more. The air above him was 
empty. Some time during the con- 
fusion of swimming the shiffen and 
fighting the raiders, the flyers had 
gone. At the same time the sky it- 
self had been changing. The hazing 
on the northern horizon had be- 
come a wide black belt dividing the 
glare of the sky from the glare of 
the desert. 

“Rig up,” he ordered sharply. 

The shiffeners obeyed without 
looking. They did not even take

time to mount, once their animals 
were loaded. Except for Hriss, who 
was almost unconscious from shock 
and blood loss, they stayed afoot, 
trotting ahead of the shiffen and 
pulling on the reins to keep the 
reptiles moving quickly. A distant 
gray line that marked the edge of 
the sink held their attention. 

Tleth looked back every few 
minutes but only to determine- what 
their pace must be to reach those 
dunes before the blow reached 
them. He estimated they did not 
have long. The stir and stringsand 
that preceded the glow were already 
swirling along the top of the sink. 

The caravan was spread out ir- 
regularly from Shiah to Tleth, but 
none of the shiffen, even those with- 
out any handlers near, were fighting 
or straying. They smelled the blow 
now, too, and did not have to be 
urged into a trot. They wanted 
cover as intensely as the shiffeners 
did. 

A gust of wind lifted a thin sheet 
of sand off the top of the sink and 
sent it spraying across the avenue, 
stinging Tleth’s ankles. The cara- 
vanmaster checked the sky again. 
The band of black was closer, blot- 
ting out a full fifth of the sky, and 
he could see several distant dancing 
columns carried by small spin- 
winds. He pulled more vigorously 
on the reins of the shiff he led. 

They could reach the dunes ahead 



IF 




of the blow, probably, for what 
good that would do. Mere dunes 
could not give them adequate pro- 
tection against a ripsand. They 
needed a windbreak, preferably 
the solid walls of a settlement, but 
at least the partial protection of a 
thick outcropping of rock. 

“Tleth!” 

The cry reached him faintly over 
the rising wind. He looked ahead. 
A shiffener was waving at him, 
motioning forward. Following the 
direction of the being’s hand, he 
saw a flickering light at the front 
of the line. Shiah was signaling 
back with a sunflash. 

S . C . A . L . E . 
R...O...C...K...A...H... 
E ... A ... D, the caravanmaster 
read. 

Scalerock? He squinted against 
the brightness of the sand, strain- 
ing to distinguish detail in the rol- 
ling land beyond the sink. Yes. The 
hills looked higher than the rolling 
dunes they had left, also somewhat 
steeper. Their faces were blotched 
with patches of near-black that 
caught the sun in glints. Scalerock. 

He reached for the sunflash 
hanging on a cord around his neck 
and sent back; F . A . S . 
T . E . R. 

Shiah acknowledged. Moments 
later Tleth saw the foremost shiffen 
stretch out. Gradually the others 
followed until the entire line was 



moving at a trot so fast it was just 
short of a gallop. The shiffeners 
could not hope to keep pace with 
their long-legged animals. They 
had to vault on, using the reptiles’ 
momentum to lift them into place. 

Tleth wished they did not have to 
burden the animals. The shiffen 
were tiring fast. It was abusive to 
expect them to hold this kind of 
pace and carry riders, too. 

N evertheless, he drove 

his own shiff harder yet and 
brought it up briefly beside Hriss’s 
while he peered at the shiffener. 
The being lay limp in the straps 
that kept him on, his eyes closed, 
the face slack. Tleth could not tell 
whether Hriss was dead or merely 
unconscious. The caravanmaster’s 
mouth set. Hriss was an excellent 
shiffener. Losing him would be. 

Tleth stifled the unhappy twist 
inside him and looked back to 
check the blow’s progress again. 

The twist sharpened abruptly 
into pure fear. Half the sky was 
black now. The wall of darkness 
towered above the desert, oblit- 
erating everything behind it, its 
raging foot touching the paleness 
of sink sand. But that was not 
what brought him snapping around 
to yell harshly at his crew as he 
lashed his animal across the neck. 
At the foot of the blackness, the 
sink sand it touched was not merely

being picked up and churned or 
spiraled into spinwind columns. 
The sand was being pushed and 
lifted and itself packed up into a 
wall, a sand wall that grew a meter 
in height for every five forward. 

“Sandwave,” he warned. 

The wind whipped his shout for- 
ward. Heads turned for the brief- 
est fractions of seconds. Then arms 
wielded lashes. The entire caravan 
broke into a flat gallop, every ani- 
mal and rider straining toward the 
protection of the scalerock hills. 
Even the loose shiffen ran in panic, 
all weariness forgotten. 

Tleth clutched the reins and kept 
his head tucked tight against his 
shiffs neck, his nictitating mem- 
branes were drawn against the 
particles of sand carried by the 
wind. The layer lifted off the sink 
and, carried with each gust, hazed 
the ground, blurring color and de- 
tail until Tleth could no longer dis- 
tinguish the edges of the avenue. 
He was forced to stop guiding the 
reptile and trust its instinct for 
footing. 

The hills loomed nearer, but so 
did the double wall of blackness 
and sand. Tleth could feel the 
ground trembling — worse, he 
could feel the shiff shaking with 
exhaustion. 

Thankfully he noticed that the 
ground was rising. The caravan 
was reaching the base of the hills. 



Strides later the leaders passed 
the first small outcropping of the 
slick layered rock that made up 
the bones of the planet. They were 
out of the sink. 

They leaped from their animals 
to climb the steep narrow trails up 
the side of the hill between cliff- 
like faces of scalerock. The men 
went up on hands and feet, claw- 
ing for purchase in the treacherous 
combination of rock shards and 
loose sand. The shiffen lunged 
in uneven, tired heaves, pulled and 
pushed by their handlers. They fell 
often and heavily, sliding back- 
ward, losing ground. Shiffeners 
cursed through rasping gasps and 
lashed the animals mercilessly to 
their feet again. 

A part of Tleth’s mind vaguely 
thought the shapes of the rock 
faces were somehow familiar but 
he did not take the time to try to 
analyze that familarity. He felt 
as though he were carrying his 
shiff up the hill. It stumbled on 
every other stride. Pebbles show- 
ered backward from the scramble 
of its broad feet to sting the cara- 
vanmaster's exposed arms and 
legs. Tleth dug in his toes and 
leaned against the shifPs quarters, 
then almost fell when the animal 
found footing and lunged up the 
hill away from him. He climbed 
tiredly after it, hoping it would 
not stumble again.

IF 




T he sound of the wind was 
reaching a shrill scream when 
he staggered over the crest. Gulping 
air into lungs that seemed afire, he 
stopped to see what kind of shelter 
the scalerock was going to afford 
them, To his shock, the shiiTeners 
were not laying their animals down 
at all but were still moving, pushing 
across the rocky hill. Disbelief 
stunned him. The sandwave would 
reach them in minutes. He could 
feel it at his back now. If they did 
not take cover immediately . 

The thought remained unfin- 
ished as his eyes, angrily seeking 
Shiah, suddenly recognized the 
sandscape. Approaching from a 
slightly different direction subtly 
altered the relationships and 
shapes of the landmarks but the 
deep desert instinct in him finally 
identified them despite that. 
Dakshan, he knew beyond ques- 
tion, lay just beyond the next hill. 

He whistled at his shiff, urging 
it after the rest of the caravan. 

“A little farther,” he sang at the 
weary animal. Their route across 
the sink had brought them straight 
to the settlement’s rear gate. Shove 
on, old egg. Just a little farther,” 
The reptile moved slower and 
slower, every line of its dragging 
legs and drooping neck and tail 
announcing its intention to lie 
down very soon and ignore' both 
Tleth and the blow. Sighing, Tleth 



used his whip. But even then the 
animal slogged up the hill only 
fast enough to stay ahead of the 
lash. Then, at the crest, its head 
came up abruptly. It squealed and 
hurled itself down the other side. 
The labyrinth of high gray walls 
and scale roofs that was Dakshan 
spread below them. Even in ex- 
haustion the shiff recognized a 
settlement and knew it meant food. 

Just as suddenly the wind 
stopped roaring in Tleth’s ears. It 
dropped to the whisper of drift- 
sand. Tleth jerked his hood more 
tightly about his head and forced 
his aching legs to run faster. Dak- 
shan’s entry maze was still almost 
a half-kilometer away. 

Into the silence came a single 
sound — low, barely audible. It 
did not remain low but swiftly 
crescendoed to a roar so great it 
reached beyond hearing. The 
pseudo-silence lasted a heartbeat 
and then was torn apart by the 
crashing explosion of the sandwave 
smashing into the high scalerock 
faces. 

Tleth lurched, almost falling. 
He caught himself on the shiffs 
rig and ran on. The walls were only 
a quarter-kilometer away now. 

The broken wave reached him as 
a fine haze of silvery particles 
sifting down from the sky like 
the dawn drizzle of the wet season. 
Another heartbeat, however, and 



CARAVAN 



lO?-' 




the blow struck. The drizzle be- 
came, suddenly, driving death. 
The grains, propelled by the 
mighty wind, pierced the tough 
fabric of Tleth’s robe to stab him 
like countless tiny skims. He felt 
no pain, though. Only numbness. 

Running blindly beside his shiff, 
he hoped they were still on course 
for the gate. He did not dare open 
his hood and expose his face. Much 
longer in the ripsand could be fatal 
to both caravanmaster and reptile. 
The flesh would be scoured from 
their bones. 

He risked one hurried peek, fi- 
nally. They were just six shiffen 
lengths from the entry maze. 

As though realizing it was about 
to lose its prey, the blow slashed 
furiously at them. But the caravan- 
master utilized the added force of 
the wind to swing through the gate. 

The wind screamed in frustra- 
tion, unable to reach him beyond 
the protective angles of the maze. 
Sand still fell in Dakshan, dropping 
from the blow as it passed over, 
but the walls shut out the wind. 

Inside the settlement, Tleth ran 
swift, probing eyes over the heav- 
ing shiffen and the equally out-of- 
breath shiffeners sagging beside 
them — over the two shes and their 
sick-huddled husband — over Hriss. 
The shiffener hung on his mount 
in the unmistakable slackness of 
death. The caravanmaster totaled 



the loss tiredly — one man, no 
cargo, no shiffen. Any reptiles that 
were lamed would be sound again 
by the time the ripsand subsided 
and the caravan could continue to 
Moveen. Objectively, it was a suc- 
cessful crossing. 

“Unrig,” he ordered when he 
had his breath back enough to 
talk again. His voice was hoarse 
with weariness. “I want every 
animal checked for strap rubs, 
sand burns and lameness and 
treated before any shiffeners leave 
the stable area.” 

The shiffeners groaned. 

Shiah regarded Tleth with 
concern. 

“Shall I find you a physician?” 

Tleth looked down at himself. 
His robe was shredded and blood- 
stained. His skin must be raw be- 
neath it. But he shook his head. 

“Later.” 

A pity, came a casual thought 
as he reached for the buckles of 
his shiffs rig, that the tarray de- 
stroyed so much of the avenue. 
The route had saved them more 
than half a day. It might be pro- 
fitable to explore the sink and chart 
if for future use. It was certainly 
worth considering — later. Pre- 
ferably, he decided firmly, filing 
the idea away, while in a state of 
intoxication in a pleasant tavinn 
garden under a clear, more 
benevolent sky. •

T here was a time when 
watching the development of 
science fiction was a breathtaking 
hobby. Here was a field where 
growth and change were violently 
explosive compared to the petty 
progress of other literatures. 



Science fiction began as a distinct 
category in 1926. It was then a 
clanking mess of thinly disguised 
lectures on technology, almost 
entirely lacking in style, character- 
ization and anything but the most 
rudimentary plotting. After a mere 
five years, however, science fiction 
had discovered space opera to give 
it scope, and new writers had lifted 
it nearly to the level of the general 
pulp writing of the time. When the 
field was a decade old, Stanley G. 
Weinbaum, Raymond Z. Gallun 
and Don A. Stuart had turned the 
bug-eyed evil monsters into alien 
friends and had replaced the won- 
ders of pure gadgetry with the im- 
pact of emotional development. 
By 1941, an influx of new writers 
had introduced style and character- 



110 




ization better than could be found 
in most magazine fiction and sci- 
ence fiction had become a literature 
of human ideas, struggles, values 
and dreams. 

Since then most of its develop- 
nnent has been much slower and 
some has been along a side-trail 
that parallels the crawling main- 
stream. Some experimentation has 
improved the field, though much 
has been simply ipecac-frosting on 
the cake. 

Probably such trends are in- 
evitable, since there must be a 
limit to how much improvement is 
possible in commercial literature. 

But because of the progress of 
the field, I was particularly in- 
terested in Ultimate World, by 
Hugo Gernsback (Walker, $5.95). 
Gernsback set the model for the 
original form of science fiction 
with his technological, predictive 
and endlessly explanatory Ralph 
124C 41 back in 1911, and 
many of the earliest stories might 
have been modeled on that. Ulti- 
mate World was written in 1958- 
1959, long after the major evolu- 
tion of the field had been achieved. 
How much had the changes af- 
fected his work? 

Gernsback was an alert, intel- 
ligent man of amazing ability, as 
his work of publishing in the 
electronics field proved. And, aside 
from the profit motive that in- 



fluenced his science-fiction publish- 
ing, he genuinely loved the type of 
fiction he had founded. It seemed 
to me that if anyone could change 
with the times, he could. 

I was wrong. The later “novel” 
differs greatly from the earlier one. 
But the changes suggest attitudes 
caused by age and our troubled 
society, not those derived from the 
premises of science fiction. In- 
stead of emphasizing gadgets that 
might bring the millennium — 
gadgets Gernsback knew as well 
as any man could— he evidently 
had accepted the stand that gad- 
gets had failed and decided in this 
work to try to save the world by an 
alien invasion and by preaching his 
personal theories of how man and 
society must be changed. For re- 
markable technical insight he 
substituted a human insight that is 
no more remarkable than that of 
any other dabbler with social 
theories. 

The style is somewhat better 
than that of Ralph, but that is 
damning with the faintest praise. 
The plotting, development, use of 
anything resembling human char- 
acters, etc., are certainly no better 
and may be worse. 

It’s a bad book. This is its first 
publication — out of deep respect 
for Gernsback and consideration 
for all readers, I hope it’s also the 
last publication.

A SCIENCE-FICTION novel 
^ that dates back to 1897 must 
set some kind of record for a First 
publication in English. To add to 
the novelty, the book is brought out 
by Southern University Press. 
Science Fiction obviously is attract- 
ing serious academic consideration 
now — provided it is ancient enough 
for the professional students of the 
genre to have mulled it over and 
reached some kind of decision on 
it. 

The title of the work is Two 
Planets. By Kurt Lasswitz, it is a 
novel that had a strong influence 
on the members of the German 
Rocket Society. To some extent it 
may have accelerated the beginning 
of the space program. The price is 
high — S 10.00 for less than 400 
pages of the original novel — but 
probably within the reach of 
enough completist collectors and 
libraries to acceptable. In fact, 
if this really were a full translation 
of Lasswitz’s two-volume work the 
rather high price certainly would 
be justiFied. 

Unfortunately, this is not a full 
translation of Auf zwei Planeten. 
Around 1948, Erich Lasswitz made 
an abridgement of his father's 
work. Now, the curtailed version 
has been used for the translation by 
Hans Rudnick, with some additions 
from the original — wherever the 
translator decided the material was 



"'pertinent to today's achievements 
— " which means that the reader 
has no way of checking it for errors 
in predictions or science, or of look- 
ing back to Find developments in 
our future that were pertinent or 
wrong in the book. 

The writing in the original 
seemed fairly good. That may be 
because the German language 
seldom reads as easily and quickly 
as English or because I was much 
less critical when the book was 
lent to me in 1934. The English 
version seems duller — the stilted 
prose makes the preachiness stand 
out more strongly. I suspect this is 
due to a somewhat too close trans- 
lation if not to a lack of literary 
fluency on the part of the 
translator. 

Still, despite almost 75 years of 
scientiFic advances, the plot is still 
reasonably plausible. And eyen 
though it is far more a morality 
novel — or a philosophical one — the 
search for Utopia does not keep it 
from being far better in its plotting 
and development than much cur- 
rent writing. It has a good basic 
situation — men discover that the 
Martians have a base on Earth, 
after which the Martians slowly 
take over Earth, initially with the 
kindest motives. But power cor- 
rupts and Earth has to Fight Mars 
before establishing a modus vivendi 
at the end. Some of the political 



112 



IF 




scenes are badly marred by extreme 
anti-British prejudice, a trend 
common in German fiction after 
Disraeli’s quenching of some of 
Bismark’s ambitions. 

If you can stand the price you 
might find the book fascinating- 
reading it is like traveling through 
time to learn the attitudes of the 
past. 

However, I cannot avoid thinking 
that the present version shows a 
marked lack of judgment on the 
part of the translator and publisher. 
Instead of being Lasswitz, this is 
the bowdlerization of his book — a 
cropped 1948 book that has now 
been stuffed with odd bits to make 
it fit 1971. That is bad scholarship. 
It is unfair to readers who might 
want to possess the original in Eng- 
lish — and grossly unfair to Lass- 
witz, who can stand — or fall — on 
his own. 

N othing can be proved 
about the development of 
science fiction from only two 
books, of course. If anything, the 
two examples seem simply to indi- 
cate that good work is more a 
matter of the caliber of the writers 
interested in the field than of the 
time in which they write. If so, 
perhaps we should pay more at- 
tention to the twists and turnings 
of interest and the evolution in the 
talents of our authors. 



One of the most interesting cases 
in this respect is Philip Jose 
Farmer. In almost a quarter of a 
century, he has tackled more dif- 
ferent types and levels of science 
fiction than anyone else I can 
remember.' He has been a master 
of the fresh idea, the straight 
adventure and the utterly wacky 
— but convincing. He has ridden a 
host of hobbies in his work. And 
as the years have gone by, he has 
become one of our most prolific 
authors. Like most of us, he has 
had a few books that were less 
than successes, but in general his 
work has scored well. 

His second novel in the “River- 
world” series is now in print. The 
Fabulous Riverboat (Putnam, 
$5.95), originally serialized in IF, 
has been expanded into a longer 
novel. 

This time we are following Mark 
Twain, revived in company with 
all people who have died on Earth. 
On a strange planet, where all life 
clings to the banks of a river that 
winds for millions of miles, he has 
gone back to his old interest, the 
river steamer. The story line deals 
with Mark Twain’s building of a 
riverboat that will go down the 
river to find the beings who are 
responsible for Riverworld and 
for humanity’s resurrection. 

Less attention is paid to those 
beings in this volume than in the 



THE READING ROOM 



113 




first of the series. But in some 
ways this is a stronger novel. 
Twain’s efforts before he achieves 
his boat, the politics that cannot 
be avoided, the societies and 
cultures that have developed along 
the river give ^epth to the story — 
the triumphs and defeats are 
marvelously real. The events in the 
book have an inevitablity — yet it is 
a delight to discover each happen- 
ing as Farmer tells it. 

Like the previous Riverworld 
book, this is a major piece of 
fiction. The next novel in the 
series will bring Burton and Twain 
together in a search down the 
river. I look forward to it. 

The latest of Farmer’s works to 
be published is wildly different. 
This is Farmer pursuing one of his 
private delights to its ultimate end. 
He has been busily working to 
prove the reality of a number of 
supposedly fictitious — and fabu- 
lous — characters and to trace their 
lives beyond the limits of the fic- 
tion in which they were involved. 

Timers Last Gift, by Philip Jose' 
Farmer (Ballantine, 95^), is super- 
ficially a time-travel story dealing 
with the distant past and our 
primitive ancestors. But in reality, 
it’s a what-ever-became-of . 

After a number of failures at 
time travel a final attempt is made. 
But now the crew includes a 
mystery member who seems to 



have bought and forced his way in. 
Yet, when the time barrel lands 
thousands of years in the past 
the rest of the crew is dismayed to 
find that he not only assumes 
leadership but that they let him do 
so. Gribardsun also seems quick to 
assume practical leadership of the 
primitives they meet and his ability 
to survive as they do is remarkable. 

There is also an odd romance 
and a fresh handling of the time 
paradox— but enough. Best if you 
figure things out for yourself. It’s 
part of the fun. In fact, the whole 
book is fun. 

I have only one. quibble with 
Farmer. No, Phil, you can’t get 
rid of Gribardsun that way. Sure, 
the first time the similarity pre- 
vented the time barrel’s going back 
to where he had been. But cells re- 
place themselves — never com- 

pletely in our short lives, of course, 
but continually. Over the course 
of millennia, this would mean that 
no molecule of his body was the 
same at the beginning of his trip. 
There would be no conflict — no 
two things appearing at the same 
time. Gribardsun would go on, 
perhaps out to the stars, perhaps 
forever. 

And that’s a quibble readers will 
have to buy the book to understand. 

F red HOYLE is another 
writer who has always fas- 



114 



IF 




cinated me. He’s an honest-to-God 
scientist of the top echelon, whom 
no one should expect to write about 
anything other than abstract 
mathematics. Every time I read of 
some major new theory in stellar 
formation or behavior, or about 
a postulate regarding the nature 
of the universe, Fred Hoyle seems 
to be given credit for much of the 
mathematical theory behind it. 
He’s familiar with it long before 
Isaac Asimov writes a book 
about it — which is known as being 
a pioneer. 

When he wrote a book of science 
fiction, I bought it only but of 
curiosity. I’d seen other attempts 
by top-flight scientists to do novels 
and I had grave doubts. But The 
Black Cloud was a superb piece 
of science fiction. It had the 
quietly effective style of a good 
English novelist and might have 
been the mature work of a top- 
flight writer. Then he did several 
other books that proved his 
ability. 

But now we have Rockets in 
Ursa Major, by Fred Hoyle and 
Geoffrey Hoyle (Fawcett, 75^). 
Okay, it carries a bit of warning. 
Geoffrey is Fred Hoyle’s son, 
working in television, and the 
novel is “based on the play of 
that title by Fred Hoyle.’’ The 
credit line suggested this was a re- 
worked television thing. But Hoyle 



had done other television work 
and had converted it into a good 
suspense book. 

Not this time. The basic gim- 
mick isn’t too bad. Earth has sent 
ships to the stars and they have 
simply vanished. Now, much too 
late, one comes back — but there 
is no crew and a message scrawled 
inside warns that if this ship re- 
turns mankind will be in deadly 
peril. 

People have to find out what the 
peril is. But no, don’t worry, gentle 
reader. Comes a ship with aliens 
(human enough to carry on ro- 
mance with Earthmen) who tell 
all. They are good guys. Out there 
are bad guys who want to sub- 
jugate Earth. But the good guys 
will save us all. And from there on 
— ho-hum. You’ve seen it all be- 
fore, but much better. Big battles 
in space where the hero (Earthman) 
must show his value by fixing a 
short in the antenna. He fails, 
which is the mark of his heroism. 
The battles are pretty bad, though 
they may be the best thing in the 
book. 

The shock really comes from the 
writing. From his past performance 
we can take it for granted that Fred 
Hoyle writes damned well. But this 
material is sad-sack writing made 
worse by an attempt to give it 
emotional punch by sticking an 
adverb after every verb. Con-

sider: Hero had just told the ship 
commander that since the radio 
won’t work to identify the ship, 
it will have to land through a bar- 
rage of almost certainly deadly 
missiles. He finishes thus: “ ‘Yes,’ 

I said laughing. ‘It’s not your 
trip.’” Ha-ha. If.it is a simple 
statement someone makes it slyly. 
If a character is worried about 
danger, he/she says it enthusias- 
tically. When all else fails, they say 
it to each other aloud. Sensible, 
that. 

I finished the book gagging. 

On a more pleasant note, I 
turn to Orn, by Piers Anthony 
(Avon, 75i). This is somewhat of 
a sequel to Omnivore — the same 
aliens are present, along with 
some of the characters of the 
earlier book. But the new novel can 
stand on its own and in many ways 
it is a better book. 

The basic situation is that a small 
crew is sent back into either the 
past or an alternate world similar 
to Earth but more primitive. 
There’s a trio — two men and a girl, 
with a fairly complicated and in- 
teresting problem laid out for her 
— she must resolve the conflict 
between her emotional and her 
intellectual responses to the two 
men. The real difficulty involving 
all three seems to be that they 
cannot be sure whether the locus of 
action is Earth of the past or a good 



facsimile. They have to determine 
the answer to gain any hope of 
survival. 

Whichever it is — it’s a world in 
upheaval and the trio is caught in 
the savagery of this. The characters 
also discover dinosaurs during a 
period in evolution when Earth’s 
dinosaurs must have been extinct 
—or must they? 

There are some good descrip- 
tions of the behavior of the dino- 
saurs, too. Anthony has obviously 
done his homework here. He has 
avoided the usual mistaken 
cliches about the ancient saurians. 
A highlight of the book is a duel 
between a scientist and a tyranno- 
saurus. The man loses his weapon 
early in the proceedings and it is 
man against saurian as nature 
made them. A good scene honestly 
resolved. 

There’s also some fine work on 
the girl’s brave, warm, and some- 
how pitiful attempt to save the egg 
of a strange bird. The cooperation 
between bird and human is told 
effectively and makes a gripping 
and effective part of the story. 

But the real interest of the book 
centers on Orn, the odd bird whose 
story this is. He represents a 
strange byroad of evolution, a race 
that developed racial memory in 
place of intelligence. 

I found this the most enjoyable 
book by Anthony I’ve yet read. •

* More of a threat was the fact 
that he did not have the force pistol 
with him. If he met something too 
large for the one-shot specimen 
gun he would be in real trouble 
without the force pistol. But since 
it was one of the few pieces of 
equipment that was really heavy 
— and its battery and cable would 
have taken up too much weight 
and space in the specimen cart — 
he had deliberately left it at base 
camp. After all, he had been here 
three months without encountering 
any animal larger than a lapdog. 
Why sweat over a dinosaur-swatter, 
then? A Buck Rogers type blaster, 
if such a thing existed, yes. A 
quarter of a ton of bulky, rarely 
used hardware, no. 

Bell — called “Bronze” by the 
few who could bear to look upon 
his outrageous ugliness — swept 
his gaze over the surrounding 
peaks, jagged and furred with deep- 
green alien vegetation. The terrain 
sloped sharply to the west, where 
his base camp -lay. Even without 
supplementary oxygen, surely the 
return would be manageable. 
Tough, maybe, but he had handled 
worse. He tried to distract him- 
self from the clicking noise by 
impressing the scenery on^ his 
memory for later description to 
Sylvia Chayams. He smiled and 



glanced at his watch. In fifty-two 
and a quarter hours he would hear 
her call on the transwave and 
would make his formal report. It 
would do no harm if the report 
were vivid as well as formal for 
the benefit of his beautiful blind 
date — actually blind, poor lovely. 

Sylvia’s image faded from his 
mind as an animal hardly as large 
as a mouse hopped along the 
ground a dozen meters ahead, 
sporting a ridiculously long tail 
and a relatively oversized chest. 
Bronze studied it a monient, chose 
a tiny hypodart from the selection 
in his belt pouch, dropped it into 
the breech of the fragile specimen 
rifle and brought the mouseling 
down with a practiced snap shot. 
The creature chittered angrily, 
plucked at the tiny needle in its 
side, then slumped helplessly to 
the ground. Bronze picked it up 
carefully with gloved fingers, and 
his lumpy face behind the breath- 
ing mask broke mto a smile as he 
noted the comically worried eyes 
of the little beast. 

“Take it easy, little fella,” he 
said. “You’ll wake up tomorrow 
without even a hangover.” 

As the anesthetic took effect, 
the little animal’s eyes closed. 
The big gentle-handed man eased 
the limp body into a plastic cylinder 
of the right size, carefully tucked 
in the disproportionately long

tail, clicked home the tube’s per- 
forated lid. 

As he moved back up the trail 
to his light two-wheeled specimen 
cart, Bronze hummed a snatch of 
dance music in deep, resonant tones 
that set his oxygen mask vibrating. 
The tune was one that had been 
played by the orchestra in Houston 
three months ago and fifty-three 
light-years away. For a moment 
Sylvia Chayams was again in his 
arms. 

B ronze thought of that dance 
frequently. It was not often 
that any girl was willing to be seen 
with him in public — and Sylvia 
was impossibly beautiful. Long 
slender legs, firm but womanly 
hips, a trim waist, high and per- 
fectly formed breasts, a cascade of 
warm brown hair, a cameo face 
adorned by huge blue eyes with 
abundant dark lashes set under 
straight brows. What a pity those 
lovely eyes were blind. 

But if she were able to see she 
would never have looked at him. 
His broken lumpy features were 
overlaid with puckered, indelibly 
blackened scars — mementoes of 
a quarry explosion. 

That night of dinner and dancing 
had been both a delight and a 
torture. Delight because Sylvia, 
radiant, had moved in his arms 
like a strain of the music itself. 



Torture because of his own feelings. 
He had wanted desperately to tell 
her how beautiful she was, to 
reach across the table and hold her 
fingers in his blunt hard hand. 
But such things were among the few 
Bronson Bell would not dare. Not 
with any girl. Least of all Sylvia. 
He could not take advantage of 
her blindness, knowing that he 
was the ugliest man she might 
ever meet. 

His conversation had been con- 
fined to descriptions of the Starfire 
Club and the people in it. At that 
he had been fluent and she had 
listened eagerly. When he had 
wanted to say anything more 
personal — or when she had asked 
him about himself — his words had 
become short and gruff. When 
he had said goodbye to her at the 
door of her apartment she had 
apologized. 

“I hope it wasn’t too tiresome — 
taking out a sightless girl?” 

“That doesn’t matter.” 

She had slipped away from him 
then. The kiss he had almost 
offered had become impossible. 

She had replied with her first 
trace of coolness, “It matters a 
great deal to me.” 

He had been able to think of 
nothing at all to say to that, 
although he had thought of a 
thousand things since. But now 
he was hearing her voice every

four days on the transwave, fifty- 
three light-years away at her Ex- 
plorers’ Monitor and Control Con- 
sole in Houston, Texas. 

S YLVIA, despite her handicap, 
held one of the most responsible 
positions in the multibillion-dollar 
program for the biological explora- 
tion of the cosmos. In addition to 
a mind that had command of a half- 
dozen disciplines of twenty-second 
century science, her miraculously 
acute hearing was a priceless asset 
in dealing with the whisperings 
of scouts’ reports amid the thunders 
of millions of continuously explod- 
ing stars — and her slender fingers 
could play the console’s myraid 
controls with unmatched deftness 
and surety. For the hundredth 
time Bronze wondered if Sylvia 
had been assigned to him or had 
deliberately chosen to monitor 
his exploration mission among 
the dozen or so that any one opera- 
tive could carry. However it might 
be, he was grateful for the luck 
that brought him — precisely every 
fourth day at local sunset — Sylvia’s 
clear voice saying, “Houston Con- 
trol calling Bell, Aldebaran IV. 
Chayams here. Come in. Bell.” 
And then less formally, “Hello, 
Bronze. Silver here. How was it?” 

T he going was tricky here, 
requiring lowering the cart 



down a jumble of rocks and steep 
bluffs, one or two of which were 
fifteen- or twenty meters high. 
Inching over the lip of one of 
these after letting the cart down 
on a line, he almost put his hand 
on the animal. 

Although obviously a worm, 
it was somewhat larger than the 
mouselike specimen he had shot 
with a dart. He had never seen 
anything like it before. It moved 
sluggishly as worms do, and its 
body was covered with a gray 
pitted shag like the bleached bark 
of an old birch. He gathered it 
up in a gloved hand and prepared to 
continue his downward climb when 
the thing elongated its body and 
writhed violently. The head end 
struck his wrist where his exertions 
had pulled an inch of sleeve out of 
his gauntlet and he felt a pinprick 
on the bared flesh. As he stuffed 
the worm into a zippered pocket 
and reached with his free hand for 
an antiseptic swab he carried in 
his shirt — the planet suddenly 
lurched and swirled like smoke 
about him. 

Hurriedly he flung himself down 
on a narrow ledge, his feet hanging 
over a ten-meter drop. The 
ground was tilting and he suddenly 
found himself clinging to a ceiling 
of stones, gazing down a long drop 
to an empty sky. Illogically he 
grasped knobs of rock at his sides 



120 



IF 




and held them with a force that 
made his fingers ache. He closed 
his eyes and waited for the effect 
of the venom to wear off. When 
he felt the planet tip to horizontal 
again he opened his eyes carefully, 
only to find that the colors of every- 
thing he saw were reversed. The 
dark-green forests had become 
wine-red, the sky had taken on a 
yellow-orange tinge and his khaki 
shirt and trousers were a nauseating 
dirty green. He waited again for 
a while, then carefully completed 
his climb down the escarpment to 
stand, panting, beside his laden 
specimen cart. 

The exertion of the descent ap- 
parently had speeded his return 
to normal. Surfaces were resuming 
their customary hues and the 
dizziness had passed. He counted 
his pulse and found it slightly 
slowed. He gave himself a mild 
stimulant by injection and ex- 
amined the bitten spot on his 
wrist. 

That Bronze-and-Siver bit had 
come about when they had ex- 
changed names during the date. 
Bronze grinned at it now and 
regarded his cart, too heavily 
loaded for its fragile wheels and 
flimsy body. Every item an ex- 
plorer scout used had to save the 
ultimate gram of weight since it had 
to be brought down out of orbit 
from the roving mother ship. 



Darwin — and returned to the 
Darwin eventually— by rockets 
burning precious reaction mass. 
The ship’s trans-light drive was 
much too massive and too expen- 
sively triggered with tritium to 
use for landing scouts. For that 
matter, even the Darwin could not 
afford to carry the echo-modulated 
transwave communicator— fueled 
at astronomical cost by the same 
tritium— that punched the stand- 
ing transwave across the light- 
years. Science had indeed broken 
the light-speed barrier, but nothing, 
apparently, could break the eco- 
nomic laws that demanded a huge 
expenditure of money for a cor- 
responding expenditure of energy. 
Money and energy were two names 
for the same thing — hence only 
one lone scout to millions of square 
kilometers of planetary surface 
and communications only through 
Houston. 

Bronze checked his specimens. 
These same economic laws made 
ridiculous any attempt at inter- 
stellar mining, commerce of even 
transport of objects. Only know- 
ledge, pouring back to Earth 
along the standing transwave, was 
worth the cost. And the most 
valuable knowledge was locked 
in the cells of alien protoplasm 
which, like its counterparts on 
Earth, was capable of infinite 
variation in response to challenges 



SILVER TO BRONZE— OVER 



121 




of alien environment. In the skin, 
glands or intestines of the long- 
tailed mouse-thing he had just 
captured might lie the cure for 
cancer, an antidote for heroin 
addiction, a longevity drug — or 
something that might restore sight 
to Sylvia’s eyes. 

H e tested the bindings on 
the cart and stood for a 
moment with the shafts in his 
hands, drinking in the beauty of 
the rugged scenery around him. 
If he could not restore her sight 
he could at least make the scene 
live for her — describe the line of 
midnight blue at the horizon, the 
smell of unfamiliar resins from the 
nearly black foliage of the trees, 
the chirps, whistles and deep- 
toned buzzings of the small wildlife, 
the touch of icy crystal water 
from melting snows untouched by 
the soot of chimneys, the fragrance 
of carpets of tiny blood-red flowers 
and even the tang of the berries 
and bitter roots he had cautiously 
nibbled. 

Soon he would have to prepare 
and eat his own prosaic evening 
meal and he wanted to be at Camp 
One by nightfall. The following 
day he would have an easy trek 
from Camp One to base, which 
would leave him time to arrange 
his specimens for identification, 
classification and, if new in any 



respect, storage in the memory 
banks of the giant computers at 
Houston Control. His portable 
micro-bio analyzer would auto- 
matically transmit the structure 
of the most complex molecules to 
Houston for later study and at- 
tempts at synthesis. Only those 
substances that could not readily 
be synthesized would call for the 
transport aboard the Darwin of 
the plant or animal that^'contained 
them. The other specimens would 
be disposed of or set free again. 

He checked his rough map for 
landmarks and started down the 
flank of the mountain between 
the shafts of his cart, humming 
his snatch of dance music and 
planning things to say to Sylvia, 
knowing that they would not be 
said as planned. Seemingly nothing 
could prevent his being gauche 
when the talk approached the 
banalities normal between a man 
and a woman. 

His humming stopped as the 
valve supplying a trickle of sup- 
plementary oxygen to his face 
mask again clicked and this time 
cut off the flow for an instant. 
He took off the mask and examined 
the valve while breathing the thin 
perfume of the ambient atmos- 
phere. Nothing was obviously 
wrong. At the base he had tools 
to take the valve apart, but base 
camp was twelve hours’ march 



122 



IF 




from here. If the valve failed en- 
tirely he would be reduced to a 
crawl. He resumed the mask and 
went on, the tune temporarily 
forgotten in favor of calculations 
of the time required to reach base 
by his reporting hour if he were 
obliged to cut his pace. If neces- 
sary he could travel all night, since 
he was not particularly tired. That 
would certainly be better than 
risking the automatic rescue mis- 
sion by the Darwin that would 
follow his failure to answer Sylvia’s 
call. The reaction of Admiral Beane 
to such an astronomically expensive 
waste would not bear thinking 
about. 

He was three hundred meters 
above Camp One, only three 
kilometers by trail from it and 
the oxygen valve giving no 
trouble, when he found the worm. 

The place bore a small circle of 
pinpricks surrounded by a red 
patch of irritated skin. He sucked 
at the punctures until a bit of 
blood oozed from them, spat on 
the ground, swabbed the wound, 
disinfected it and applied a circlet 
of sterile plaster. Then, with a 
long-handled wire clamp, he fished 
the worm carefully out of the 
zippered pocket and looked at it 
wryly. 

“I think you’re going to have 
something interesting for the com- 
puters, my friend,” he told it. 



pushing it into a cylinder of appro- 
priate size and stowing it beside 
the recently captured mouse. 

II 

H e picked up the shafts 
of the cart and started to- 
ward a narrow ravine that crossed 
the plain ahead of him. By the time 
he reached it he had all but for- 
gotten the bitten wrist. Humming 
his dance melody, he lowered the 
cart to the bottom of the steep- 
sided declivity, scrambled down 
after it and tossed the coil of line 
attached to the cart up the opposite 
slope. He began to climb after the 
line and had nearly reached the 
top when he was in blackness and 
falling. When sight and sensation 
returned he was sprawled an arm’s 
length from his cart. His left 
ankle was sending frantic pain sig- 
nals— alternate stabs of ice and 
fire. 

He unlaced the boot and pulled 
down the heavy sock to examine 
the injury. The ankle had already 
begun to swell and was suffusing 
with a brownish tinge of blood. 

Man, that looks nasty, he 
thought. Going to be rough making 
the base in time to call in. 

He wriggled his toes cautiously, 
vaguely remembering that if he 
could do so the ankle was not 
broken. He found he could move 



SILVER TO BRONZE— OVER 



123 




the toes, but the cost in pain dis- 
couraged further testing. He laced 
the boot again, pulling the laces 
as tight as he dared. It wouldn’t 
do to cut off the circulation, but 
the ankle must be immobilized. 
When he tried to stand he almost 
fell again. It took some further 
bracing of the boot with straps and 
a short-handled prospecting ham- 
mer before he was able to hobble. 
Then, to his dismay, he found that 
it would be impossible for him to 
haul the specimen cart out of the 
ravine. 

The bottom of the ravine was 
growing dark by the time he had 
made a cache of the vegetable 
specimens, improvised a make- 
shift knapsack and fashioned 
crutches from the shafts of the 
cart. He released the animal 
specimens, most of which scuttled 
off among the stones and brush. 
Only the long-tailed mouse seemed 
to have adopted its captor and 
showed a tendency to follow 
Bronze about. The big man leaned 
down to the creature and with 
gentle hands pointed its nose into 
some tall grass and tapped it on its 
little rump with a forefinger. 

“Run off, Mickey — or Minnie, 
as the case may be. I’m not going 
to have time to play with you,” 
he said. 

As the tiny creature took refuge 
in the clump of grass. Bronze 



shouldered his pack, slung the 
specimen rifle over it and started 
painfully up the side of the minia- 
ture valley. Halfway to the top 
the laboring valve of his breather 
mask gave one sharp, final click 
and refused to supply oxygen. 

S YLVIA CHAYAMS sat at 
' the console of her transwave 
communicator, her padded ear- 
phones not yet in place. Her slender 
fingers drifted in a^ghostly dance 
over the dials and switches. A 
lilting dance tune went through her 
mind as she worked, and her fin- 
gers moved in unconscious rhythm 
with the music. What a wonderful 
evening that had been with the 
big spaceman. Bronze Bell. His 
calling her Silver had been a 
delightful touch, too. If she 
married him people would probably 
call her Silver Bell. 

Her mind shied away from the 
thought. This was going too fast! 
Still, the only flaw in the precious 
hours she had spent with him had 
come at the end when she had so 
clumsily mentioned her blindness. 
There had been an element of self- 
defense in her doing so and she 
hated herself for it. She had known 
from the balance of his body and 
the slight tenseness of the fingers 
that held her hand that he had been 
about to kiss her and she had 
blurted her stupid remark to keep 



124 



IF 




him from doing so. She wished 
fervently now that she had accepted 
the kiss. She was sure, somehow, 
that Bronze would not have been 
like the others, the succession of 
men who had dated her, telling 
her monotonously that she was 
beautiful, then groping with thick 
fingers at the buttons of her blouse 
or the zipper of her skirt. Like 
the slob who had insisted on taking 
her to a movie— a movie, of all 
things! — and, with his arm around 
her shoulders and one hand finger- 
ing the under-curve of her breast, 
had handled himself with the other. 
He had thought that because she 
was blind she could not tell what he 
was doing. Ugh! 

Bronze was not like that. For the 
first time she had felt like a normal 
girl on a normal date. His hand on 
her back as they danced had felt 
cool and firm. Her head had 
fitted so comfortably in the hollow 
between his neck and shoulder as 
they moved about the floor and, 
though the floor had been crowded, 
he had protected her so easily and 
deftly that they had never come into 
contact with any of the other 
dancing couples. 

There were other things about 
him, too. What other man she 
had ever met had known how to 
make things vivid in her darkness? 
What was it he had said at last 
transwave contact, describing a 



velvet-petaled flower fifty-three 
lights from Houston? 

... a red like the taste of burnt 
orange peel . 

Sylvia was smiling to herself as 
Kate Hoggins clumped by on her 
canes on the way to her own 
console. 

“Hi, Sylvia. Dreaming about 
a spacer? Who’s your contact this 
shift? Bell?” 

Sylvia’s smile became a friendly 
grin. Kate always asked questions 
in groups of three. 

“Yes to your first question,” 
she said. “I was dreaming — sort 
of. About the contact, it’s Hashi- 
moto’s report from Aldebaran II 
tonight. Bell’s not due to report 
in until — ” Sylvia’s fingers strayed 
briefly to a clock set in her console 
and touched the exposed hands— 
“twenty-three hours, thirteen min- 
utes from now.” 

“Got him timed to the minute, 
hey? A little bird told me Bell 
took you to the Starfire Club the 
last time he was on leave, right? 
Did you have a good time?” 

“Wonderful.” 

“You like to dance, don’t you? 
Did you dance? How was he as a 
dancer?” Kate’s voice changed to 
a wistful note. “I’d give my soul to 
be able to dance again!” 

Sylvia frowned. Kate was inviting 
a break in their unvoiced rule 
against mutual commiseration 



SILVER TO BRONZE— OVER

and admission of handicaps. 

“At least you can enjoy a show 
with your date and see what he 
looks like.” 

“Yeah. There is that.” Kate 
dropped her hand lightly on 
Sylvia’s shoulder, then hobbled 
to a place in the line pf consoles. 

Sylvia smiled after her. Like 
most blind persons she did not 
like to be touched, but she had 
come to expect — and not not mind 
— Kate’s friendly fingers. 

Sylvia checked the clock again, 
pulled the phones over her ears, 
delicately reset a dial and began 
her evening’s stint. 

“Houston Control calling Hashi- 
moto, Aldebaran II. Chayams 
here. Houston Control calling 
Hashimoto, Aldebaran II. Chay- 
ams here. Come in. Hash. Over.” 



B ronze struggled to the lip of 
the ravine, his breather mask 
dangling uselessly on his chest. 
The shortage of oxygen, the exer- 
tion of the climb, the agony of the 
twisted ankle— these combined to 
pour trickles of sweat down his 
forehead and into his eyes. He 
dashed away perspiration with a 
forefinger and sourly looked at the 
oxygen mask. The fall had prob- 
ably damaged it beyond repair. 
He put it to his face and inhaled 
strongly. Nothing came from it 



but a slight odor of plastic and oil. 
He tapped the valve lightly. Some- 
thing cracked and the canister ex- 
hausted its contents in one hissing 
burst, leaving a thin frost on the 
inside of the mask. 

That was it. No oxygen. 

How long could a man live on 
this planet without supplementary 
oxygen? Quite a while if he didn’t 
exert himself. Not very long if he 
did. The planet’s animals were all 
oxygen breathers. But they had 
disproportionately large lungs and 
their respiration rate was more 
rapid than that of Earthly animals. 
He would have to increase his own 
breathing rate. And rest more 
frequently than even his damaged 
ankle demanded. Instead of ten or 
twelve hours it would take him all 
day and all night to make base 
camp. He checked his watch and 
the lowering sun and resumed his 
slow, painful progress. 

Two hours later he estimated 
that he had made only two-and-a- 
half kilometers. The local sun was 
already touching the horizon. The 
pain in his ankle had settled to an 
enormous, hammering throb. He 
paused on a slight rise, panting 
rapidly and heavily, and looked 
about him. The reason might have 
been the advancing twilight, but 
the landmarks looked oddly un- 
familiar. He set down his pack and 
balanced on one crutch while he 



126 



IF 




rummaged for his map. It was not 
in the pack. 

Neither was his compass. He 
had probably left both in the speci- 
men cart back in the ravine. The 
compass was the lesser loss as the 
planet’s magnetic field was weak 
and variable, but the lack of his 
map was serious. He looked 
about him carefully, trying to rec- 
ognize some landmark as it might 
appear from an unfamiliar angle. 
The sun’s disk was half below the 
horizon now and the long, brown- 
ish shadows emphasized the ir- 
regularities of the terrain. Directly 
ahead loomed a jumble of rocks, 
a formation he could not recall 
from the outward trip. His dam- 
aged ankle would force him to 
skirt that obstacle. But should he 
go north of it — or south? No sense 
bothering with Camp One now. He 
had no time to rest. All he could be 
sure of was that base camp lay 
generally westward. Perhaps tlie 
landmarks would become more 
easily recognizable ' as he ap- 
proached it. 

With the sun below the horizon 
it would be difficult for him to be 
sure of continued progress west- 
ward, however, and this planet 
had no moon. On the plus side was 
the fact that fifty-three light-years 
made little difference in the fa- 
miliar constellations. But he would 
have to remember that because of 



the planet’s orientation, Formal- 
haut was its pole star. Suddenly 
the effort to recall which of the 
constellations, therefore, would 
rise east and set west or vice 
versa made his head whirl. Pain- 
fully he reshouldered his pack and 
started toward the fading glow of 
sunset, angling south of the jumble 
of rock ahead. As he did so a deep, 
coughing rumble like the grunt of a 
hunting lion came faintly to his 
ears. 

Bronze stood motionless for a 
moment, then resolutely reminded 
himself that a loud or deep-toned 
noise did not necessarily mean a 
large animal. There were Louis- 
iana bullfrogs whose deep- 
throated roar could be heard for 
miles. He wondered if he could 
describe to Silver what he had 
just heard in terms of bullfrogs and 
decided that he could not. There 
it was again! The rumbling sound 
tensed the muscles of his back and 
sent cold thrills racing along his 
nerves. It did not help to remind 
himself that so far no large pred- 
ators had been found on the 
planet. 

He unslung his rifle and, while 
some dim light remained, loaded it 
with the most powerful anesthetic 
needle he could find in his stock. If 
the animal turned out to be as 
large and hostile as it sounded he 
might never make it to base camp 



SILVER TO BRONZE— OVER 



127 




at all. Thinking of base camp and 
of Silver’s low, sweet voice detach- 
ing itself from the crackling 
thunder of the stars, he strained 
his eyes to check the remaining 
hours until report time. The alien 
beast grunted again, closer, and 
Bronze noted that a light breeze 
was blowing in his direction from 
the rocks. Panting his laboring 
lungs full of the unsatisfying air, 
he resumed his tottering march 
westward. 

S YLVIA CHAYAMS removed 
her headset and sat back in 
her chair, gently massaging the 
muscles of her neck. She replayed 
the last few inches of Hashimoto’s 
tape to make sure of the quality 
and recording level. But she was 
thinking not of Hash and his 
amusing, deliberately Japanese- 
English descriptions of the finds 
of his trip, but of Bronze Bell. She 
touched the dial of her console 
clock. Sixteen hours and four 
minutes and she would begin 
calling Bronze. 

Her shift was over. She checked 
the almost inaudible hum of the 
standing transwave, which was 
never allowed to die, and shut down 
the rest of her board. She would 
go to her apartment, bathe, dial 
her favorite meal from the auto- 
chef. Thank heaven for that warm, 
kitchen-smelling machine which 



made it possible for her to eat at 
home without having someone in 
to prepare and serve her meals! At 
the Starfire Club, Bronze had not 
made the usual mistake of handing 
her the menu or attempting to read 
it to her. He had confidently or- 
dered for her instead and his 
choice had been marvelous. Bland, 
aromatic quenelles in a thick 
sauce. Spicy bits of toast buttered 
with beef marrow that one was ex- 
pected to eat with the fingers. 
Nothing that had to be cut with 
knife and fork or pursued about 
a slippery plate. A delicious des- 
sert of chirimoya ice cream. She 
had eaten with the same assur- 
ance as the sighted diners around 
her while listening to his deep 
velvety voice commenting on the 
club and the other diners without 
seeming to describe them, but 
giving her, nevertheless, a sharp 
picture of the scene. Some of the 
women at Control had commented 
in her hearing on Bell’s astonish- 
ing ugliness, but this big, gentle 
and thoughtful man would never 
be ugly to her. God protect him and 
bring him home safe from his 
strange and dangerous job. 

Suddenly she had a vision such 
as only the blind can know, A huge, 
loathsome beast, rough-furred, 
long-fanged, with enormous eyes. 
Its forelimbs were armed with foot- 
long, curving talons and It scur-

ried through a dim purple light 
with terrifying and sure-footed 
agility. Then the image vanished. 

Sylvia shook herself lightly, re- 
trieved her purse from a drawer 
and left the Center, softly and 
somewhat tremulously humming 
a snatch of dance tune as though it 
had some mystic but uncertain 
power to protect Bronze. 

Ill 

T he beast was angling outward 
from the jumble of rocks on 
Bronze’s left in a path evidently 
intended to intercept him. He 
could hear its deep^ booming grunts 
coming closer. Night had fallen, 
but the atmospheric glow and the 
light of the stars made it possible 
for him to see obstacles in his 
path and outlined the hill against 
the faintly luminous horizon. What 
was the size of the animal? It was 
obviously stalking him, so it must 
be large enough to have confidence 
in its own powers. Ignoring the 
pain, which was now lancing up his 
leg and left side. Bronze forced a 
slight increase in his hobbling 
pace. 

His stalker had miscalculated 
the interception point— Bronze 
heard the beast some hundred 
meters behind him, as well as he 
could judge the distance. He wished 
he could hold the specimen rifle 



in his hands, but he could not 
manage both rifle and crutches. 
Still more he wished that he could 
see the thing— form some idea of 
its size and appearance. It might 
be some harmless herbivore fol- 
lowing him out of simple animal 
curiosity. His imagination in- 
sisted, however, that the thing was 
a predator and considered him 
prey. 

He remembered that in rummag- 
ing for the forgotten map he had 
found a couple of firelighters in 
his pack. One of these might pro- 
vide enough light as it burned to 
make the creature visible if it came 
closer — perhaps enough to give 
him a reliable shot at it with the 
rifle. He took the time to find and 
hand one of the firelighters at his 
belt, then resumed his march, re- 
solved not to attempt a showdown 
with the beast unless and until it 
came too close for safety. 

The exertion of hoisting the pack 
to his back increased his already 
frantic breathing rate and for a 
moment he felt a return of the 
dizziness that had preceded his 
tumble in the ravine. The sensa- 
tion passed quickly but left him un- 
certain of his direction. The stars 
did not look as they had a minute 
ago— or had it been an hour? Or 
two? Was that Scorpio off there to 
the right? And if so, what was it 
doing there? He puzzled over it. 



SILVER TO BRONZE— OVER

but the problem seemed insoluble. 
He was about to shrug it off — 
then brought himself up short. 

“Wait a sec. Bronze, my friend,” 
he told himself out loud. “You 
can’t just laugh this off. This is 
serious. Anosh — anoxia — that’s 
what’s making you so offhand 
about this. Take a deep breath.” 

He took a dozen in rapid suc- 
cession, straining his lungs to their 
utmost capacity. Then he stood 
still and studied the stars until he 
was correctly oriented again. 

He heard the coughing roar 
close behind him. The lumbering 
stalker had come perceptibly 
nearer. Bronze hurried on. The 
muscles of his chest and abdomen 
were aching from the unaccus- 
tomed strain of rapid and continued 
deep breathing. And still he was 
not getting enough oxygen. If only 
he could keep ahead of the brute 
until dawn, being a nocturnal 
hunter maybe it would abandon 
the chase. 

He almost made it to the first 
glow of daylight, but an incautious 
swing of his improvised crutches 
tangled in some weeds and Bronze 
came crashing to the ground in a 
blaze of agony. 

Behind him the hunter increased 
its pace. 

B ronze could actually hear 
the animal’s padded footfalls 



before he found the firelighter at 
his belt and ignited it. The sight of 
the beast paralyzed him for a mo- 
ment, then he grabbed the rifle 
and swung it in the thing’s 
direction. 

Larger than a terrestrial buf- 
^falo, it was feline in general ap- 
pearance. A shaggy mane about 
the shoulders increased massive 
aspect of a huge chest and upper 
body. The face was hideously ugly. 
Worse than my own. Bronze 
thought fleetingly. 

He raised the rifle and in the 
uncertain light of the sputtering 
flare drew a bead on the neck— 
fired. As he did so the beast low- 
ered its head, began a charge. The 
dart lodged in its wet, tender- 
looking muzzle. It emitted such a 
shriek of pain and fury that Bronze 
cowered. The creature halted, 
pawed ineffectually at the dart, 
looked straight into its tor- 
mentor’s eyes across the dying 
flare. Then it began a deliberate 
advance much more menacing than 
any wild charge. 

With fingers made stiff and 
clumsy by hours of gripping the 
improvised crutches. Bronze at- 
tempted to reload. The needle 
cracked in the chamber and the 
gun was hopelessly jammed. 
Meanwhile the beast continued 
to move steadily forward. 

Balanced on one leg. Bronze 



130 



IF 




raised the rifle by the barrel for a 
last-ditch and certainly inef- 
fectual defense. The monster was 
within leaping distance when the 
anesthetic took partial effect. It 
collapsed. 

Bronze looked down at it. 

It was panting hugely and its 
eyes still followed his every move- 
ment. The semi-paralysis obvi- 
ously would not last long. The 
beast was much too big to be 
felled for long by just one of 
Bronze’s charges. He looked about, 
the sweat cooling on his body. 
Not a stone or stick in sight- 
nothing he could use to finish the 
thing off. The rifle and the crutches 
were too light for the job. 

“Something tells me, my pretty,” 
Bronze said aloud, “that I’d better 
put some distance between us be- 
fore that shot wears off.” 

He chose direction by the stars, 
hobbled away. The giant’s 
clouded eyes still followed him. 

S YLVIA returned on shift unac- 
countably tense. She had slept 
badly, disturbed by vague dreams 
of undefined disaster. Kate Hog- 
gins’ habitual pat on the shoulder 
made the blind girl jump ner- 
vously. She ran fingers over the 
board for the daily check but near 
the end could not remember if she 
had tested every switch and dial. 
In exasperation she checked again 



—and a third time to be sure. The 
stubby hands of her glassless clock 
told her she still had twenty 
minutes before contact with 
Bronze. The moments dragged 
interminably as she waited. 

Bronze would be on time, of 
course. He always was. But what 
would she do if he were not? What 
if something had happened to him? 
She thrust ' that worry aside for 
another, less immediate. Would 
he call her again when he returned 
to Houston in six months? Prob- 
ably not. One date with a blind 
girl was all you could expect of any 
man, however charitable. Mean- 
while she could content herself by 
contact with him through the trans- 
wave twice a week. Perhaps it 
would be better if she didn’t an- 
nounce herself to his “Bronze” with 
that silly name of “Silver.” Over 
the months it might come to seem 
embarrassingly intimate. She 
began her call a full minute ahead 
of schedule. 

“Houston Control calling Bell, 
Aldebaran IV. Chayams here. 
Come in. Bell. Houston Control 
calling Bell, Aldebaran IV. Chay- 
ams here. Come in. Bell. Houston 
Control . .” 

D aylight on Aldebaran 
IV did not, as Bronze had 
hoped, discourage the giant cat- 
thing. He could see it in the dis-

tance, apparently fully recovered 
from the anesthetic, humping along 
with a determination as great as 
his own but not with the speed of 
Earth cats. Nor was it trying to hide 
its presence. He could hear its re- 
peated rumbling roar. There was 
an angry quality, to the sound. 
Evidently the creature was one 
that held a grudge. The anesthetic 
had given Bronze only a kilometer’s 
start and now he was tiring. He 
took a moment to lighten his 
pack, leaving a little pile of odds 
and ends on the trail behind him. 

When the cat came up to the 
discarded equipment it paused long 
enough to rip the stuff to shreds: 
During this exercise in malice 
Bronze gained a hundred meters 
and berated himself for not having 
dropped the things one at a time. 
He resumed his march, his lungs 
laboring painfully and his foot 
sending stabs of agony up his side 
clear to the neck with each step. 

The brute behind him had cut 
the lead to less than five hundred 
meters when Bronze saw the 
stream. It was both a welcome 
and a dismaying sight. It told him 
roughly where he was in relation 
to base camp. The stream ran 
well south of the camp and he now 
knew he would have to turn north. 
He glanced at his watch and esti- 
mated the probable distance he 
had covered. Assuming that he 



had passed Camp One in the 
night, it would be necessary for 
him to veer northwest. He noted 
the angle of the sun over his 
shoulder and headed for the 
stream, looking back anxiously to 
see if the cat would make directly 
for him across the angle rather 
than follow his footsteps. It turned 
directly toward him, ignoring the 
scent of his steps, and before 
Bronze had reached the water the 
cat had gained a hundred meters. 

Now the unpleasant part of hav- 
ing a river in front of him came 
into play. The morning was bit- 
terly cold and Bronze was shiver- 
ing in his clothes despite his exer- 
tions. From previous experience 
he knew that the stream came 
from a snowfield and would 
scarcely melt ice. Worse, a chilly 
breeze was blowing and it would 
multiply the effect of sodden cloth- 
ing. If he could take off his shirt 
and trousers and somehow keep 
them dry during the crossing it 
would help — but the beast was too 
close. Maybe the water would stop 
the thing or at least slow it up. In 
any case, nothing was to be gained 
by lingering on the bank. Stretch- 
ing his tortured lungs to their 
limit, he plunged into the green 
water, armpit deep. 

F ording the stream was the 
worst ordeal yet. Slippery 



132 



IF 




stones wrenched at his injured 
ankle. The cold drove the breath 
from his lungs and made it impos- 
sible to fill them fully again. Once 
he stepped into a hole and the 
swiftly moving water closed over 
his head. For a moment the idea 
flashed across his mind of breath- 
ing in the icy torrent and letting 
nature take its course, but he 
struggled to the surface, losing the 
now useless gun and one of his 
precious crutches in the process. 

He made it across, but barely. As 
he struggled up the opposite bank 
he cursed himself for having tried to 
cling to his pack. It now weighed 
more than he could lift in his 
weakened state. He squirmed out 
of the straps and let it lie on the 
ground, pouring a stream of water 
over his leg. It hardly seemed 
worth the trouble to get to his 
feet. Suddenly he saw a vivid men- 
tal image of Sylvia Chayams. She 
was looking at him with disdain, 
as if she did not like what she saw. 

“Bronze, my friend,” he said to 
the air around him, “I don’t think 
she’d appreciate it if you quit on 
her. The gal likes to dance, remem- 
ber? She can’t see how ugly you 
are—” 

With infinite care he climbed to 
his feet, tucking the one remaining 
crutch under his left arm. He 
looked at his watch, still running. 

Time? Damn, it was time to 



make his report. Silver’s voice 
would be riding the transwave 
now. Would she give him a couple 
of hours’ leeway before calling the 
starship? If he became a billion- 
dollar rescue case because of a 
lousy sprained ankle, would she 
ever dance with him again? Neither 
of them would be able to hear the 
music for the snickering. Mean- 
while her voice was calling. 

At the top of his lungs he roared 
an answer. An echo reached him 
from the other side of the stream. 
He looked back at the beast and 
grinned. 

“You ugly bastard. I hope you 
can’t swim.” 

The hope was quickly blasted. 
Already the creature was reaching 
its forepaws into the water, yowl- 
ing angrily and inching in deeper 
until only its head and massive 
shoulders were visible. Then, with 
a grunt of fury, it launched itself 
into the current and began 
paddling. 

It was not a good swimmer. The 
current began to drag it down- 
stream. Bronze turned upstream, 
heading for a low rock-covered 
hillock some distance to the north, 
dragging his pack. If he could get 
to those boulders maybe he would 
find some small enough to throw 
yet big enough to do damage. It 
was a chance. Bronze left the pack 
on the ground near the stream and 



SILVER TO BRONZE— OVER 



133 




wrenched himself toward the 
rocks, gasping his answers to 
Silver, telling her to wait — keeping 
time with his gasps. 

Behind him, three hundred 
meters to the south, the cat mon- 
ster climbed out of the stream, its 
shaggy fur clinging to its flanks. 
Instead of making directly for him 
it turned blindly upstream, sniffing 
for his scent. At last it turned 
north. When it found his pack. 
Bronze gained another hundred 
meters while the beast ripped 
everything to ribbons. Then it took 
up the trail again, inexorably. 

AT HOUSTON Control Sylvia 
XX Chayams’ voice was growing 
slightly hoarse. 

“Houston Control calling Bell, 
Aldebaran IV, Chayams here. 
Come in. Houston Control . .“ 

/ wonder if he's hurt .

Chayams . .” 

Or dead? God, please don't let 
him be dead . 

“Come in. Bell. Houston Con- 
trol calling . .” 

Maybe he's just forgotten his ‘ 
schedule. That's what it is. He's 
forgotten, the overgrown idiot. / 
wonder if I should call the star- 
ship? No, not yet. He'd kill me if 
it weren't a real emergency. But, 
damn him, why doesn't he answer? 

While the call was going out 



Sylvia’s slim fingers were ghosting 
over the control panel, checking 
and rechecking. Everything was 
functioning. 

“Houston Control calling 
Bell . .” 

A little crowd was gathering be- 
hind her, watching the panel for 
some external sign of Bronze’s 
reply. No one spoke. One never 
spoke to a transwave operator when 
the phones were in place. 

“Houston Control . .” 

Bronson Bell, if you've simply 
slept through your watch— boy, 
am I going to give you a piece of 
my mind! Let it be that, God. He's 
just asleep. That has to be it, the 
big lummox! 

Houston Control calling B . .” 

C LIMBING the rocky hum- 
mock cost Bell heavily in ef- 
fort. Nothing on it that he could 
lift or wrench loose would serve 
to keep the cat-beast at bay, much 
less cripple or kill it. But the hill 
had other advantages. From its 
summit he could see the mast of 
the transwave with the glittering 
little aluminum shack at its base. 

Bronze gave a hoarse cheer and 
began to scramble down the other 
side of the hill toward base camp. 

Only twenty minutes behind call 
time. You might make it. Bronze. 
In another half-hour. If the 
Grunting Wonder back there

doesnt make a meal of you first . 

He was keeping quiet, but as if 
in reply the voice of the beast 
thundered from the rocks behind 
him. He threw himself forward 
and rolled down the slope. 

Soon Bronze was only a hundred 
and fifty meters from the shack. 
But the great shaggy animal was 
again nearly within leaping dis- 
tance. Bronze faced it and threw a 
handful of gravel. It flinched, 
probably remembering the dart, 
but stood its ground, snarling. 
Bronze tore off his sodden shirt 
and threw it down. While the brute 
ripped the shirt to tatters its 
quarry made another thirty 
meters. The trousers went next, 
torn from his body without his 
trying to pull them over the boots. 
Then his underclothing. Each time 
the respite was shorter, the repul- 
sive monster closer. At last, as 
Bronze stood naked save for his 
shoes, his improvised crutch snap- 
ped in two. He flung the pieces like 
lances and dropped to his hands 
and knees, scrambling painfully 
over the rocky soil. 

His knees bloody ribbons, his 
eyes fogged by a red film, his ears 
filled with the roaring of the pur- 
suing beast. Bronze snatched open 
the door to the base shack and 
tumbled in. 

While the beast rasped its heavy 
claws at the doorframe and the 



flimsy walls shook. Bronze turned 
a petcock on the shack’s oxygen 
tank and breathed the gas into his 
lungs in great starved gulps. 

He was instantly in a state of 
euphoria. Childish giggles escaped 
him as he switched on his trans- 
mitter and shouted, “Bell to 
Houston Control.” Another giggle. 
Then: “Bronze to Silver. I love 
you, my Silver Bell!” 

The clearest thing to come to 
Houston over the whispering 
transwave, cutting through the 
thunder and hiss of the exploding 
stars, was the giggle. 

Sylvia was stunned. Bronze, the 
big ... the .. the mess, was not 
dead, not hurt, but simply un- 
speakably drunk! 

“Love me, do you? Well then, 
prove it, damn it. Report.” 

On Alderbaran IV the shack 
shuddered under attack from 
without. Bronze wiped a bloody 
hand on the battery case of the 
force pistol and mumbled, “I’ll 
tend to you later, kitty--” then 
turned to the set. 

“What do you mean, prove it?” 
he bellowed. “I got to the goddam 
phone, didn’t I?” 

“Report,” Sylvia snapped and 
two heavy tears rolled down her 
cheeks. She hated him — the big, 
sloppy, drunken bastard! 

But her ridiculous heart was 
singing. •

but also gave it life and death pow- 
ers over him. The voice continued 
to brief him. His amnesia, caused 
by a concussion during the De- 
stroyer raid on Onaris, was com- 
plicated by the fact that, before 
starting on his mission, he had been 
hyp no-conditioned to represent 
himself as a leading Onarian 
scientist, Syncretist ANDER 
HALTERN, whom the Destroyers 
were known to be looking for. 

The voice in Brons head was 



sometimes that of JAYCEE, an 
acid-tongued but attractive female 
commando; of DR. VEEDER, 
Group medical officer; and of 
GENERAL ANANIAS, its mili- 
tary member. Under the Group* s 
direction Bron duly fell into the 
hands of the Destroyers and was 
taken aboard the enemy spacefleeTs 
flagship, commanded by the De- 
stroyers* leader CANA, who 
received him cordially, believing 
him to be Ander Haltern. Cana*s 



137 




lieutenant. COLONEL MARTIN 
DAIQUIST. however, suspected 
Bron/Halterns credentials and 
subjected him to a test. With the 
aid of the real Ander Hal ter ns 
coaching through the transfer link, 
Bron easily passed the test and was 
given restricted freedom of the ship 
by Cana. 

As Cana*s ** guest** Bron/ Hal tern 
witnessed— from space — the total 
destruction of Onaris by a ''hell- 
burner** missile, whose arrival 
Cana had accurately anticipated. 
The event matched the Destroyers* 
reputation for planetary destruc- 
tion — Cana, however, disclaimed 
all responsibility. The hellburner 
missiles always followed Destroyer 
raids and were of unknown origin, 
according to Cana, and this last 
one had undoubtedly been intended 
to kill Ander Haltern — it had 
struck Onaris at exactly the spot 
where the Destroyers had seized 
Bron/ Haltern. 

To prove his innocence Cana 
invited Bron/Haltern, as a master 
syncretist and expert on the "pat- 
terns of chaos** — which Canas 
own scientists had used to compute 
the arrival of the hellburner — to 
check all data available on the 
ship. Bron/Haltern did so and also 
used his freedom of the ship to 
compute the course of Canas fleet 
back to the Destroyer*s baseworld 
— information Earth wanted and 
Bron transmitted to the Group via 
the transfer link. His activities, 
however, reawakened Daiquist*s 



suspicions and he was transferred 
from the flagship to another vessel, 
the Tantalus — a former Terran 
laboratory ship long since captured 
by the Destroyers and now part of 
Canas fleet. 

Aboard the Tantalus Bron made 
a startling discovery — the ships 
entire instrumentation had been 
exactly reversed: dials read from 
right to left, etc. Checking back, 
Bron also found that the Tantalus 
had once been commanded by 
General Ananias, who had aban- 
doned her and presumably her crew 
in space. When he confronted 
Ananias with the information via 
the transfer link the latter tried to 
kill him. Jaycee saved Brons life. 

Under the coaching of the real 
Ander Haltern via the transfer link 
Bron/Haltern established himself 
as an expert on the patterns of 
chaos with Cana*s own expert, 
LAARIS, who now captained the 
Tantalus. Studying the patterns 
, with Laaris, Bron learned that the 
Tantalus was doomed to destruc- 
tion via the same agency that de- 
molished Onaris — a finding that 
tended to support Canas theory 
that some mysterious force in the 
universe was determined to kill 
Bron. 

Of more immediate concern to 
Bron, however, was his growing 
conviction that General Ananias 
had sold out to Cana. While the 
Destroyer fleet was making a sub- 
space Jump homeward Bron suc- 
ceeded in secretly launching 



138 



IF 




Tantalus’ hell burner torpedoes at 
what he believed to be the Des- 
troyers* base- world. Subsequent 
events proved him wrong on all 
counts — too late he tried to warn 
Cana, whose men beat him mer- 
cilessly. Bron came to on the planet 
he had doomed, to discover that 
Ananias had been rebroadcasting 
the supposedly secret transfer-link 
communications on Canas wave- 
length and that Cana now knew 
who Bron really was. 

The rebroadcasts actually helped 
Bron to convince Cana of the im- 
minent arrival of the Tantalus 
hellburners in time for the latter to 
evacuate most of his men — he had 
merely used the planet as a stop- 
over base during raids. The 
hellburners arrived before the 
evacuation was completed — the 
entire planetary system was des- 
troyed and Cana lost heavily in 
men and materiel. Tantalus was 
demolished in the holocaust as 
predicted by the chaos patterns 
and Cana remained convinced of 
Brons value to him as a ** chaos 
catalyst.** He not only let Bron 
live but permitted him to try to 
manipulate chaos events to alter 
their patterns when these seemed 
to doom some of the remaining 
Destroyer ships. Brons success 
was partial but spectacularly un- 
precedented — and when the pat- 
terns of chaos suddenly predicted 
the imminent arrival of an ap- 
parently invincible attacking alien 
fleet from outside the galaxy, Bron 



— at Canas insistence — was named 
to command the combined Terran 
and Destroyer forces summoned 
to repel it.

ii AND that’s the score at the 
X\. moment.” Ananias’s voice 
came wearily over the FTL radio. 
“An advance party of about a 
hundred alien vessels is already 
within the confines of the Milky 
Way. This appears to be the spear- 
head of the main attack force still 
moving in from the void.” 

“Didn’t the advance party show 
up on chaos analysis?” 

“Yes, but we couldn’t determine 
the significance of our readings. 
Some activity was apparent in the 
direction of the Space Dependen- 
cies, but we couldn’t plot its posi- 
tion accurately — we were working 
with too short a baseline. Now 
that we have access to the De- 
stroyer chaos records we can cor- 
relate with a fair degree of 
accuracy.” 

“Now is too late,” said Bron. 
“It should have been done five 
years ago.” 

“Agreed. You and Cana and I 
know that, but Terra couldn’t be 
bothered to listen. How do you 
want to play this, Bron?”

fleet. Prepare six battle cruisers 
to make a direct attack on the 
smallest grouping of alien ships 
you can locate.” 

“Why not use the whole fleet?” 

“Because any ship of ours that 
goes into that battle may notx^ome 
out again. I want the maximum 
amount of information from the 
minimum number of ships at risk. 
All data on weapons effectiveness, 
both positive and negative, are to be 
transmitted via FTL radio and re- 
corded for analysis.” 

“Engaged.” 

Ananias cut transmission. Bron 
relaxed slightly and looked along 
the Skuas bridge, which had be- 
come his command post and had 
been virtually his home during the 
past thirty-six hours. All the com- 
munications posts were fully 
manned by the extrovert but none- 
theless efficient Destroyer tech- 
nicians. His assumption of 
Daiquist’s former position had 
gone smoothly. Bron had the feel- 
ing that his somewhat unusual 
status as a master syncretist, plus 
his obvious familiarity with battle, 
command procedure, had already 
created around him something of 
a legend. Certainly he could have 
asked no more in the way of respect 
and willing obedience from the 
tough Destroyer shipmen. 

The Skua and a hastily regrouped 
assortment of seven Destroyer 
ships had left the comforting rim- 
line of the extremities of the Milky 
Way and were now engaged in 



their own exploratory run, similar 
to the one being undertaken by 
General Ananias and the Com- 
mando fleet well within the Rim. 
Bron could feel the weight of a 
great loneliness— it beset the mind 
as his ship carved deeply into the 
terrifying void between the great 
galactic clusters. The eight were 
on the trail of a lone alien straggler, 
which purely random chance had 
detected as a solitary, isolated pin- 
point in the wastes of extra- 
galactic space. 

The detectors had already located 
and confirmed the course of the 
alien and soon the screens were 
beginning to pull in the first indica- 
tions of electronic contact. The 
weapons crews were busily setting 
up their missile programs, but 
Bron decided not to call for a 
chaos analysis of the outcome of 
the attack. He preferred to go into 
battle still full of the undimmed 
hope that an adverse analysis 
would have destroyed. The eight 
vessels all had a specific pattern 
of weapons to employ and the 
directive was simple — after per- 
forming the allocated task they 
were to withdraw out of attack 
range and stand by for further 
orders. 

S OON the alien was clear upon 
the screens, a trimmer, more 
acutely wicked craft than the one 
that had destroyed the Jubal. This

weapon points or merely a 
peculiarity of the hull plating. As 
he watched the critical registers 
run toward battle-zero, Bron 
again sensed the quieting of the 
alien tongues in his head— the 
hushed expectancy. The babble fell 
to a low moan, a tense anticipation. 
Anticipation of what? One does 
not anticipate defeat or victory 
with quiet expectation — only the 
springing of a trap! 

Instantly he was on his feet and 
running toward the communica- 
tions point, shouting with such 
urgency that all eyes turned to him. 

“Abort the attack! All ships 
abort the attack and drive clear. 
Crash emergency!” 

The image on the screens drop- 
ped out of focus as the Skua swung 
into a violent turn that almost 
broke her spine. The great ship 
fled in the tightest arc its gravitic 
compensators would allow it to 
follow without destroying the 
crew. Even so, a lack of compensa- 
tion of several gravities subjected 
the men to a stress component 
many times that to which they 
were accustomed. But as the 
screens came back into focus, the 
sounds of complaint died im- 
mediately. 

Bron’s outburst had been 
justified. 

The alien ship blew up. It split 
in one incredible second to form a 
fireball that became a raging 
quasi-stellar inferno and finally 
a quasi-star. The shipboard radia- 



tion detection systems screened 
warnings of impending break- 
down of the biological protection 
screens. Then the mad sun col- 
lapsed and died, its energy con- 
sumed and dissipated in its short 
but fantastic life. 

Bron called in his companion 
ships. Not one had suffered serious 
damage. Their captains were 
grateful — though still bewildered 
by the orders that had brought 
them out of the maw of a searing 
death. Another part of the Bron 
legend had been added to the 
Destroyer chronicles. 

B ron was unable to explain. 

He was having an increasingly 
difficult time hearing normal con- 
versation above the rising level of 
angry goose-snarl and bicker the 
futile loss of the alien ship-weapon 
had evoked. When his head-noise 
finally quieted he called Com- 
mando Control. 

“Are you there, Jaycee?” 

On-line Bron. 

“Anything to report from your 
end?” 

They re having trouble with 
noise in the Antares receiver. 
Sounds like somethin boilin in a 
pot. They re Jilterin it out now, but 
it was bad a short while ago. That 
was quite a fireworks display you 
just had. 

“They used to serve a drink with 
a comparable effect in a little bar 
at the back of Europa Commando 
Base. Six shots and you woke

three days later with radiation 
sickness instead of a hangover. 

I could do with a bottle right now.” 
Jaycee began to laugh. Sounds 
like the old Bron memory might 
be returnin. 

“It is, in little unconnected bits. 
But most of what comes back Fd 
as soon not remember. And I still 
can’t remember you. Should I?” 
That's classified information, 
Bron. I cant give you an answer. 
“Damn it, I demand an answer.” 
''You're not getting one. While 
we're coupled on a mission, we're 
part of a psychologically matched 
team. We don't dare do anything 
to upset that, Bron — if it goes out 
of balance the linkage becomes 
quite intolerable. Especially for 
you. 

“And for you, Jaycee?” 

I don't count. I have to solve my 
problems my own way. But you 
can tolerate me in your head for 
such long periods of time only be- 
cause I supply somethin' your per- 
sonality needs. You may be a 
warlord to Cana and the General 
Staff, but I know you're a Godlost 
louse and it's my job to make sure 
you never forget it. 

“Thanks for nothing. But you’ve 
given me something I’m going to 
work on. Did you get me any an- 
swers from Ander yet?” 

He^s in the viewing room feeding 
maths into the computer terminal 
like he was payin' the rent out of 
his own pocket. Do you want him 
on-line? 



“Not if he hasn’t finished. Just 
add the tapes of that last alien 
encounter to the stuff he’s already 
working through. Might give him 
something new.” 

Are you on to somethin', Bron? 
“I have a feeling that the aliens 
aren’t going to be defeated by con- 
ventional weapons. If they’ve 
studied our chaos patterns over 
the ages, they’ll know all too well 
the limitations of our present arms 
technology. If they’re the master 
technologists they seem to be, 
they’ll already have made sure that 
their fleet is relatively immune to 
our diffract-meson and other 
particulate reactions. Yet we must 
have acquired something that’s 
worrying them, I believe, or they 
wouldn’t have moved so suddenly 
against us at this particular time.” 
And you think you have a line on 
what our worry factor is? 

“All the evidence points to this — 
it has something to do with chaos. 
They tried to stop Cana from ac- 
quiring chaos men. They tried to 
stop me on Onaris. They used a 
sort of chaos non-event weapon on 
the Jubal. It begins to look as if 
chaos itself holds the key to the 
battle. But how to fight a physical 
spacewar using a mathematical 
abstraction is something 1 don’t 
begin to understand.” 

^^TJECEIVING you, Ananias. 
-l\-How did it go?” 
“Diabolically, Bron. We lost all 
six ships to the weirdest space

IF 




strategy I ever saw. The aliens 
rammed them.” 

“They what?” 

“Rammed our ships in straight 
collision courses — in one-for-one 
exchanges. Whichever way our 
ships turned, one of those damned 
aliens swooped on it and exploded. 
I’m worried, Bron. When we battle 
that fleet coming in from the void, 
we won’t have the numbers to fight 
them on such a basis. And our 
weapons don’t touch them at all.” 

“You’ve met them in space be- 
fore, on the Tantalus. Tell me 
about that time.” 

“That was different. The Tanta- 
lus was on a deep-space exploratory 
voyage. We dropped out of sub- 
space about nineteen parsecs out 
from the Rim to establish real- 
space bearings. To out astonish- 
ment we immediately picked up 
readings of a ship closeby. We 
know now that they must have been 
aliens using a chaos prediction on 
our drop-out point, but in those 
days chaos to us was scarcely more 
than a toy. The coincidence of 
another vessel’s being so close to us 
after our casual drop-out seemed 
remarkable. We tried to make con- 
tact, but received no answer to our 
signals. Next the alien came 
straight at us on a crash course. 
There was an explosion or some- 
thing — I’ve never quite been able to 
remember what — and I blacked 
out, probably for a long time. 
When I came around, the crew was 
dead and the whole ship seemed 



foreign and strange. It took me 
quite a while to accept that both 
the ship and 1 had undergone lateral 
inversion. At first I was convinced 
that it was purely a trick of eye- 
sight. I don’t know what killed the 
remainder of the crew, but it 
seemed to be some sort of shock.” 

Ananias paused for Bron’s re- 
action. Bron said nothing. Ananias 
went on. 

“I drifted for days. I had no crew 
to run the ship and not much of it 
would have functioned in any case. 
It took all my effort just to stay 
alive, patching a life-support 
system onto a rather inadequate 
emergency supply. Finally Cana’s 
long-range detection system must 
have spotted the Tantalus — they 
sent out a patrol to investigate. 

“Cana wanted the warning about 
the reality of the aliens conveyed to 
Terra in no uncertain terms. I 
agreed to take back his message. 
He had me put on a tramp ship at 
the freeport on Stere and I returned 
to Terra and told the story straight. 
It was interpreted as an elaborate 
lie to save my skin — with the sug- 
gestion that I’d sold the Tantalus 
to the Destroyers. 1 was officially 
reprimanded — but unofficially I 
had a few friends who took the 
warning seriously. One of them was 
you — ” 

“All right— we’ll go into that 
later. First let’s see if we can wring 
some sense out of what we know 
about the aliens thus far,” Bron 
cut in. “We’ve already seen them

use four different modes of de- 
structive or disruptive space attack 
—the non-event destruction of the 
Jubal, the ramming of your six 
ships, the explosive destruction 
of the one I attacked, and 
the lateral-inversion shock on 
the Tantalus. None of these modes 
involved weapons as such — the 
aliens may not have evolved any. 
They appear to rely on the use of 
their ships, kamikaze fashion, as 
destructive instruments. But all 
these modes involve materials and 
methods that belong to an order of 
science well beyond our present 
grasp of physics. Additionally, all 
four are completely different. Since 
the incidents were well separated in 
time and space it seems reasonable 
to suppose that we haven’t yet seen 
the full spectrum of the enemy’s 
destructive effects.” 

“Would they employ variation 
for variation’s sake?” asked 
Ananias. “Or do you suspect some 
other significance?” 

“1 suspect deeper significance. 
They’ve spent millions of years 
experimenting with chaos analysis. 
I’ve already proved that if you can 
provide an effective substitute for 
a predicted event — you can chejit 
the chaos prediction. But there’s 
a limit to the range of substitute 
effects we can manufacture. I think 
they’ve analyzed this coming battle 
many times over and stacked the 
deck heavily in their favor, knowing 
we can’t match them on their tac- 
tics. We don’t have enough ships.” 



“Which means we’re damned 
from the start.” 

“Not necessarily. There’s a log- 
ical consequence to that line of 
reasoning that may be the piece 
missing from the puzzle.” 

“I’m damned if I can see it,” said 
Ananias. “But then I seldom could 
follow the deviations of your 
tortuous mind.” 

T OOK at it this way, Ananias. 

Suppose you were playing 
a computerized war game. Having 
taken a sound theoretical beating, 
you would reconsider your tactics, 
evolve a new strategy, and submit 
your revised program for a re-run. 
Given enough imagination and 
sufficient computer time, you could 
ultimately evolve a technique that 
predicted a high probability of 
victory against any odds.” 
“Agreed. But I don’t see how it 
applies in this case.” 

“Suppose the aliens played a war 
game on the coming battle, using 
chaos to analyze the results. Sup- 
pose they saw they would lose it, 
went back and tailored the embryo 
designs of their fleet. Then they re- 
ran and kept tailoring until they 
thought they had the right answers. 
Don’t you see the logical inference?” 
“Frankly, no.” 

“Then I’ll tell you. It means that 
chaos predictions are not fixed and 
immutable. There must be parallel 
alternate tracks where the final 
resultant is dependent on some 
branching in the chain of causality. 



144 



IF 




There are actual decision points 
that can change the entire structure 
of future history. Perhaps that’s the 
role of a chaos catalyst. Perhaps he 
alone can break the predetermined 
web and shift the future to a new 
track.” 

“My God, Bron! If you’re 
right—” 

“I have to be right, Ananias, 
because if I’m wrong there won’t 
be much hope for Homo sapiens 
when that armada gets through.” 
“How do you plan to make use 
of the idea?” 

“By inserting some of the Bron 
brand of chaos into the general 
situation to give us time to breathe. 
I want to try playing the system 
against itself. You’ve got a transfer 
link transceiver in your radioship?” 
“Yes, but I don’t see—” 

“Hook up the receiver to your 
most powerful FTL radio trans- 
mitters and have all ships lock on 
to that. On ther transfer link you’ll 
find an alien signal. Antares is 
having trouble with it, so you must 
be able to receive it. When you’re 
approaching a battle situation 
during which the aliens get tense, 
you’ll find the signal quiets down. 
When they sound hushed and ex- 
pectant — worried — that’s the time 
to get out fast.” 

“How will that help?” 

“Past performance tends to in- 
dicate that a percentage of the 
aliens will destroy themselves at 
that critical point. We can avoid 
some of the disasters by making use 



of this realtime feedback on when 
to quit. They’ll probably catch on 
to the tactic soon enough— but 1 
think we’ll have them worried for 
a while — ” 

The clangor of the battle alarm 
tore Bron from the hand-set and 
sent him racing for the screens. As 
yet nothing was visible, but the 
computer output terminal was 
angry with coordinates and course 
predictions of ships that seemed to 
occupy a mammoth arc in space. 
To judge from the activity, miany 
hundreds of alien ships were ap- 
proaching from the void. A large 
number of them were exhibiting 
chaos shockfronts that foretold of 
ultra-violent entropic changes. 

Bron had a sudden change of 
mind. He ran from the bridge to the 
ship’s chaos complex, calling for a 
forward scan of the patterns con- 
taining the Skuas own red shipline 
trace. The computation was hastily 
set and the long graph of chaos 
ripples that surrounded the ship’s 
existence began to issue from the 
plotter. For a sweep extending 
several hours ahead, the red trace 
ran unwaveringly down the center 
of the chart, showing no deviations 
despite the turbulence of the pat- 
terns in the near continuum. Then, 
at a particular point, the red trace 
leaped to a maximum— and fled 
immediately to zero. 

A startled murmur rose from the 
assembled technicians as the pre- 
diction of the end of their own 
existence was registered only a few 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

hours away in time. Bron cut in 
curtly. 

“Run that scan again to the same 
point. As soon as you reach the fall- 
off, reset and start again. Let me 
know as soon as you obtain a dif- 
ference between two consecutive 
scans.” 

H e became aware that Cana 
had entered the complex and 
was taking an acute interest in the 
proceedings. 

“What are you up to, Syncretist? 
Are you still trying to prove that 
the future doesn’t necessarily have 
to happen?” 

“I submit there’s a flaw in chaos 
theory and I’m determined to prove 
it.” 

“With all those alien ships com- 
ing in you’ll need a miracle more 
than a theory. You have about four 
hours to disprove the tenets of a 
complete science.” 

“Chaos is neither complete nor 
science,” said Bron. “Think about 
it. The aliens wouldn’t have tried 
to stop me on Onaris if they had 
seriously believed I was going to 
fall four hours from this moment.” 
Back on the bridge the screens 
were now showing myriad points 
of unresolved light — the alien ar- 
mada was crowding in from the 
void. A chill tension governed the 
actions of the crew — even with the 
Commando fleet to back them, the 
defenders were hopelessly out- 
numbered. The further knowledge 
that they had no effective weapons 



superimposed on the tension a sort 
of dumb fatalism quieter than panic 
and strangely, not entirely devoid 
of hope. 

“Jaycee, get me Ander. Urgent.” 

Vve got him on-line, Bron. I 
thought youd need him around 
about now. 

“Good girl. Ander — I suspect 
there’s a flaw in chaos theory. I’m 
suggesting that a future event 
established by chaos analysis 
doesn’t necessarily have to happen. 
I submit that cause and effect may 
be made to diverge and that the 
initially recorded resultant may not 
in fact be the final one.” 

It*s part of Yohanns multi-field 
theory. The idea is well supported 
by mathematics but has never been 
verified. 

“I think I may have that verifi- 
cation. You’ve been going through 
the tapes, so you’ll recall I cheated 
chaos a little by arranging a sub- 
stitute explosion in lieu of the de- 
struction of the Anne Marie. Was 
that not a divergence of the causal 
chain?” 

Only a slight deviation. Another 
ship, the Jubal, was destroyed 
instead. 

“Yes, but destroyed at a later 
point in time. What if in that bor- 
rowed time something in the sit- 
uation had given rise to a new chain 
of causality? The new chain could 
not have existed had not the orig- 
inal one diverged.” 

A brilliant bit of theorizing, 
Bron. But there's no proof Un- 



146 



IF 




fortunately nothing happened to 
initiate a new chain in that bor- 
rowed time. 

“Oh, but it did, Ander. In that 
time I made the decision to ask you 
to check the tapes of the incident, 
and a direct consequence of my 
having done so is this present 
conversation — and any actions I 
may take because of it. If the orig- 
inal chain had not diverged, this 
particular conversation could never 
have occurred.” 

A silence ensued while Ander 
thought the situation through. 

Point conceded, Bron! The full 
implications are too big to be 
swallowed at one gulp, but I would 
say you have produced valid proof 
of a deliberate redirection of 
history. 

“That’s all I wanted to know,” 
said Bron. “I’m going to play that 
angle, if necessary, until the uni- 
verse breaks up.” 

He broke off as an excited chaos 
technician came up, waving a 
chartstrip at him. 

“She impossible, but ’ave ’ap- 
pened. Shipline does no’ go zero 
any more. Is what you call bloody 
magic! Is insane!” 

“Insane or not,” said Bron, “it’s 
the way things are going to be from 
now on. From now on I’m taking a 
hand in deciding what the resul- 
tant’s going to be. But I’ll tell you 
one thing, I doubt the universe will 
ever be the same again.” 

You re not only a Godlost louse, 
you re a Godlost egotistical louse. 



Jaycee said bitchily deep inside his 
head. Cut loose like that again and 
Til tell you things about your 
mother that will make you wish 
youd been born from an egg-case.** 

XVIII 

A NANIAS, did you get that 
MM. alien signal on FTL trans- 
mission yet?” 

“About two minutes ago, Bron. 
We’re currently raising a radio 
alert to make sure all fleetships lock 
on to the transmission and relay 
it for the captain’s attention.” 
“Good. Make sure the captains 
know how to use it. I’ve ordered 
the Destroyer fleet to lock on to 
the same frequency. Since there’s 
only one signal, we’d better try 
to phase our attacks so that 
we don’t have two in progress 
simultaneously. I’m gambling on 
the fact that the aliens may 
not have FTL radio — so they won’t 
suspect how they’re being antici- 
pated. Use normal weaponry 
during the attacks in order to dis- 
guise out change of tactics.” 
“Engaged, Bron. Do you want 
us to move straight in?” 

“As soon as you’re ready. We’re 
just mustering formation. Then 
we’re going to move straight down 
the centerline and have a crack 
at anything that comes.” 

“I’ll say one thing for you,” 
commented Ananias. “When it 
comes to backing hunches, you 
back yours in a big way.” 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



147 




Bron broke the connection then 
called Cana on the shipboard com- 
municator. The span of alien ships 
now swam large on the screens. 

“We’re set to attack in about ten 
minutes. I’d be happier if you’d 
consent to board a corvette heading 
out of battle range.” 

“Why?” asked Cana. “What had 
you in mind?” 

“We’re going to try a technique 
that may upset the balance of chaos 
to a point where we can’t rely on 
analysis for our answers. We’ve 
no means of telling whether this 
ship — or any ship — will survive the 
battle. I’d prefer to see you headed 
safely toward baseworld.” 

“If we lose this battle,” said 
Cana, “the aliens will come 
straight through anyway. There 
won’t be any baseworld to be safe 
on. Thank you, but I’ll stay aboard 
the 5/cwa.” 

“As you wish. I merely thought 
I’d let you know the odds.” 

“Bron, in the short time I’ve 
known you I’ve lost every certainty 
I ever had about life and the nature 
of the universe. You don’t play the 
odds — you bend them to fit the 
way you want to go. You’re one 
of the most terrifying characters 
I’ve ever met.” 

ril second that! said Jaycee 
archly. 

Lightly at first, then with an 
increasingly sonorous thunder, 
the mighty gravitic drives bit into 
the fabric of space and hurled 
their charges toward the alien 



horde. Ahead of the great ships, 
like a miniature fleet in itself, 
drove a wave of diffract-meson 
torpedoes, px)tential minature 
novae running like avid hounds be- 
fore a hunt. The images on the 
screens lost their multiplicity and 
began to concentrate on narrower, 
more detailed fields as the De- 
stroyer fleet flung itself straight 
at the unknown enemy. 

A chorus of alien voices rose in 
a complex wave inside Bron’s 
head — he detected patterns of 
rising alarm, of jubilation, of 
expectancy and fear.The speaker 
at his elbow repeated the diversity 
of sounds — but though he had 
control of the speaker’s volume, 
he had no such power to protect 
himself from the sounds within 
him. 

Then came the first contact. The 
abortive flare of diffract-meson 
warheads hazed the screens mo- 
mentarily. When they cleared again 
it was to reveal three Destroyer 
ships concentrating on an alien 
pacemaker. The ships dived in a 
perfectly conventional attack ma- 
neuver and the alien signal fell 
to a hushed moan. At its ultimate 
atonal expression of expectancy 
the Destroyer ships pulled clear. 
For an instant nothing happened — 
then the alien was engulfed by a 
flame that stripped its very atoms 
of cohesion and scattered an 
impossible bloom of unknown 
ionization broadly across deep 
space. 



148 



IF 




I N Bron's head the alien voices 
sang their wrath large and 
venomously. He was not dismayed. 
He had already calculated a 
method of keeping their complaints 
within a tolerable range. With 
sure fingers on the console keys, 
he signaled the next sortie. 

Two Destroyer corvettes, dis- 
playing an admirable turn of speed, 
shot straight toward a configura- 
tion of three alien vessels on what 
was apparently a deliberate crash 
course. For once the aliens seemed 
to falter. Two made hasty course 
corrections as if to avoid the im- 
pudent aggressors. The third stuck 
doggedly to its route and Bron 
suspected that it was yet another 
gutted container. 

With a precision beautiful to 
watch the corvettes bore down 
mercilessly upon their prey. 
Though Bron had planned the 
maneuver, even he was caught by 
the suspense of the action, was 
seized with a sudden fear that the 
plan had misfired. Both craft 
approached their targets to in- 
credibly narrow limits before they 
vanished abruptly from the sky. 
Only the voices of their captains 
still reciting tachyon coordinates 
on the subspace radio convinced 
him that all had gone as intended 
and that the corvettes had slipped 
safely into the subspace continuum. 

Disappointingly, the alien ships 
did not immediately perform their 
suicidal role. They clung for several 
seconds to their crash-evasion 



courses, apparently not convinced 
that their attackers had actually 
gone. One, however, had adopted 
a setting that took it too close to 
the undeviating “container” ship. 
They touched, and both ships broke 
apart with the same type of event- 
less energy reaction that had de- 
stroyed the Jubal. The trajectory 
of the remaining vessel took it 
lazily through the fringes of the 
crumbling flotsam before it, too, 
fell apart like tin held in too hot 
a flame. 

An almost complete silence now 
quelled the alien voices. It was un- 
typical, warning Bron that some 
new factor was entering the battle. 
Immediately he had a suspicion 
that the fight was not destined 
to be one-sided. Vainly he hunted 
across the screens, trying to identify 
the threat. He saw the pattern too 
late to figure out its portent. 
Seven alien ships were involved, 
one centrally and the rest ranged 
in regular array in a vast ring a 
half-million kilometers in diameter 
— which included nearly half the 
compass of the Destroyer fleet. 
Superficially nothing was different 
about these vessels except that they 
kept station in this unusual forma- 
tion with completely mathematical 
precision. 

The alien mutter fell below the 
audible threshold. Plainly some 
diabolical purpose lay behind the 
strange formation, whose function 
Bron found impossible to imagine. 
Unfortunately he did not have time 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



149 




to search for an answer. A De- 
stroyer battle cruiser, reading no 
significance in the design, at- 
tempted to pass between the hub- 
ship and the exterior ships of the 
ring. The cruiser was vaporized 
instantly — some unknown molecu- 
lar lightning had flashed between 
the hub-ship and one of the ring- 
ships. The fact that this unlikely 
pulse was a quarter of a million 
kilometers in length did not seem to 
attenuate its effects. 

Bron winced and closed his eyes 
as the major disaster struck his 
fleet. Fully thirty Destroyer vessels, 
unable to identify their particular 
danger or unable to maneuver in 
time, were caught by the grisly 
lightning. The blazing lines of fire 
cut a wide core through the De- 
stroyer ranks. 

The alien expectancy noise now 
was up full. Above its tones Bron’s 
orders were rapid and articulate. 
Ships on the fringps of the fleet 
were ordered to attack the alien 
ring-ships by approach from outside 
the ring’s circumference. Two ships 
misjudged the relevant positions 
and were consumed. Then came a 
stroke of genius — a cruiser’s cap- 
tain put an unmanned pinnace on a 
crash course with a ring-ship. The 
alien vessel exploded in a blaze of 
pure energy. Unbalanced, the re- 
maining ring-ships discharged their 
bolts at each other as well as at the 
hub-ship. The disk within the ring 
became a blaze of energy of a type 
that should never have existed out- 



side of the structure of an atom. 
Bron held his head as the ring col- 
lapsed. He strove to restrain a 
scream as wave after wave of alien 
reaction threatened to swamp his 
reason and drive the logic from his 
head. 

After a quarter of an hour the 
bitter outcry quieted. Bron began 
to receive reports of the cost of the 
operation to the Destroyer fleet. He 
had lost more than fifty ships and 
another twenty had taken precipi- 
tate jumps into subspace. A few 
might one day return. His con- 
fidence shaken and his forces dan- 
gerously depleted, Bron could only 
stare at the oncoming armada and 
wonder what the end was going to 
be. 

He felt lonely and inadequate. 

ON*T think fm cry in for 
you, said Jaycee brutally. I 
always knew you were a congenital 
loser, Fve got Ander on-line, Hes 
not only a man — he's got ideas, 
“I’ve got ideas, too. One day I’m 
going to beat hell out of you Jaycee. 
But I could use something con- 
structive right now. What’s the 
readout, Ander?” 

I was puzzled by that shell of a 
ship, Bron, I ran a chaos analysis 
back to its origin. It's contempo- 
rary with the Onaris hellburner — in 
fact the whole fleet is. They've all 
been in space for seven hundred 
million years and made the whole 
journey at sublight speed, 

“Hell— are you sure?” 




150 



IF 




There s no doubt of it. The theory 
accounts for the throw-away con- 
tainers. According to my calcula- 
tions better than ninety-nine percent 
of that fleet must be now consist of 
gutted provision ships. 

“That puts a slightly different 
complexion on things,” said Bron. 
“At least Fm now only looking for 
a few dozen manned ships in the 
whole outfit.” 

Probably fewer than that. Any- 
way, you have the great psycholog- 
ical advantage. 

“How do you compute that?” 

Self-evident. Meeting you is the 
climactic point of some seven 
million centuries of endeavor. No 
life-form, whatever its psychology, 
could regard that point lightly. In 
fact, you re the reason the fleet 
exists! There s no evidence to show 
whether its builders are a race with 
exceptional longevity or whether 
theyve bred through many genera- 
tions on the journey — but either 
way, you re a super-legend. Would 
you dare to take on God Almighty? 

“Frankly, Fd cringe at the 
thought — if I were convinced he 
existed.” 

Precisely. But they are convinced 
that you exist. That’s why I think 
the raid is defensive rather than 
offensive. 

“Defensive? You have to be jok- 
ing, Ander.” 

Not at all. Lacking .subspace 
access, not one of those ships can 
ever return. There’s no point in 
their engaging in a destructive 



attack — unless it’s a sort of last- 
ditch defense. No, Bron. This is a 
one-way suicide mission, hell-bent 
on trying to divert some aspect of 
chaos-predicted future history. 

' “If that diversion includes the 
destruction of the Destroyer space- 
force, then they’re close on target. 
Even their empty container ships 
are pretty formidable weapons.” 
Quite deliberately, intended as 
such, I suspect. For that sort of 
journey every atom of payload 
would have to worth its weight in 
potential. Knowing in advance the 
physical effects available to us, the 
aliens would have engineered 
virtually every molecule in the fleet 
both to withstand our destructive 
capability and to destroy in ways 
against which we’d have no defense. 

“What you’re postulating sub- 
stantially agrees with what we’re 
finding. Even the empty hulks are 
immune to particulate and nuclear 
reactions. Their only weak point 
seems a susceptibility to self- 
destruction initiated by near or 
complete contact . Jupiter! 
Ander, I think you may have given 
me an answer. The function of a 
catalyst is not to cause a reaction 
but to accelerate a reaction already 
latent. In fact, to outplay the 
system at its own game.” 

T he next moments saw Bron 
running across the bridge, 
calling for the weapons master and 
the ship’s armorer. He outlined his 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

new tactics to them, set them mov- 
ing on the double to make the 
necessary modifications in Skuas 
torpedo warheads. He instructed 
the ship's captain to locate a suit- 
able target for an experiment, then 
spent a few fleeting instants advis- 
ing Jaycee of his view of her place 
in the lower Firmament. Having 
done this last he felt much better. 

Already the aliens apparently 
sensed the new excitement. The 
waves of muttering grew shorter in 
period and a spreading panic 
seemed to be expressing itself in a 
volume of sound steadily rising 
toward some thixotropic crescendo 
it never actually attained. Bron 
could even detect quick and urgent 
voices, individuals calling and re- 
sponding, a nervously increasing 
tension that hinted of fear and 
anger and terrible resentment. He 
could almost picture the aliens 
crowded in darkness, dripping with 
moisture, smelling of unknowable 
fluids because of too close confine- 
ment with impossible engines. He 
thought he could read their leaning 
toward violent death as a Final 
escape from a foredoomed and 
long-suffered incarceration. 

His target chosen, Bron waited 
for the armorer’s clearance on the 
weaponry. He did not get the go- 
ahead until his ship had entered 
battle range. There were only 
seconds to go before the critical 
registers would run to zero. Know- 
ing that he was now committed, he 
keyed his confirmation and allowed 



the computers to take over battle- 
control. 

With the alien target ship clear 
upon the screens, he watched the 
long slim space-torpedoes slide out. 
Their progress across the space 
vector seemed maddeningly slow. 
The tension rose audibly among the 
Destroyer crew. 

As the torpedoes crawled toward 
their target the magnification of the 
screens increased to provide a 
close-up of the area where the 
actual strike would take place. 
Normally a strike’s reaction bril- 
liance overloaded the screens and 
precluded any viewing of the exact 
moment of impact — but when 
Bron’s modified torpedoes hit no 
energy was released from the pro- 
jectiles themselves. Instead, the 
stricken alien put out crazy spirals 
of some unknown mode of energy 
discharge. The screens remained 
clear. 

For a tense moment the alien 
craft developed long, coruscating 
helixes of purple fire, like some 
surrealistic porcupine. These dis- 
crete rays of energy lengthened to 
peacock-tail configurations and 
could easily have enveloped any 
closely attacking ship. Then the 
curious emanation collapsed and 
died, leaving only ion-contaminated 
vacuum to mark the place where 
the ship had been. Almost- the 
entire mass of the alien ship had 
been converted to controlled-release 
radiation — a fantastic technical 
potential, the purpose of which had 



152 



IF 




been thwarted by Bron’s modified 
weapon. 

T hroughout the entire epi- 
sode the goose-mutter had been 
subdued and anxious. This time 
there was no returning roar, only a 
continuing murmur of despondency 
and fear. Bron ordered another 
target ship to be found, and he 
relayed details of the new technique 
to several companion ships. He 
sensed that somehow the aliens 
could read the consequences of his 
decision-making. The steady de- 
pression in their voices convinced 
him that his present course of 
action was going to swing the battle 
decisively in his favor. 

A second successful sortie rein- 
forced his conviction that he was on 
a winning streak. Soon two other 
fleetships reported enthusiastically 
that the method worked. The prom- 
ise of again being able to attack 
with long-range weaponry galva- 
nized the Destroyer fleet into 
action. It was for this type of space- 
war that the crews had been trained 
and the magnificent ships equipped. 
Now they were again the Destroy- 
ers in a truly literal sense. 

Bron winced as he saw a hundred 
of his ships simultaneously engage 
the enemy. The bronze-hued ships 
moved like fireflies, weaving in- 
tricately slow patterns against the 
vast backdrop of the void. The dark 
alien vessels maintained the metic- 
ulously straight, lonely courses of 
the damned. Soon the aliens were 



erupting into futile suicidal re- 
actions in half a hundred different 
modes of physical disruption. Great 
wastes of space became momentary 
suns or were lit with vast tracts of 
impossible ionization. Sometimes 
these reactions were so fierce and 
numerous that a new galaxy 
seemed-being born beyond the 
shores of the Milky Way. 

“Ananias. Come in, Ananias.*' 

“On-line, Bron. We can see you 
now. That looks like quite a party 
you’re having.” 

“Yes. We’ve found their Achilles’ 
heel. Their vessels are not suscep- 
tible to destructive reaction, but 
they destruct themselves if sub- 
jected to physical contact. Our 
normal space missiles had proxim- 
ity fuses, so they never made physi- 
cal contact before they actuated. 
All we’re doing is taking the fuses 
out of the warheads.” 

“But if you withdraw the fuses, 
the warheads can’t activate!” 

“They don’t need to. The entire 
alien fleet is on a suicide run. Every 
damn atom of it is programed for 
catastrophic destruction. All you 
have to do is trigger it.” 

Space blossomed before the Skua 
with a hundred fleeting suns. Ion 
trails glowed like neon bars. Red, 
violet and yellow fire pockets 
sprouted like fantastic flowers in 
space. An insane landscape of in- 
substantial radiation effects was 
emerging plainly on the broad 
canvas of nothingness. The alien 
voices were now a continuous 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



153 




scream of fear without perceptible 
inner-modulation or separation of 
components — but rapidly becoming 
thinner, as though the members of 
the unholy choir were sinking one 
by one and drowning in their ter- 
rible pool of fire. 

XIX 

F inally the alien voices faded 
and died, the last traces linger- 
ing like smoke after a summer’s 
fire. As the Commando fleet cut 
through to join the Destroyers it 
was already apparent that Bron was 
going to win the battle. Soon the 
ships from the combined fleets 
simply ranged wide through space, 
seeking and destroying stragglers. 
Ultimately there was a silence in 
Bron’s head. 

He felt a compelling wave of 
fatigue sweep over him. He had 
not slept for better than thirty 
hours. When the trailing fringes 
of the battle no longer demanded 
his immediate attention he quit his 
desk, went to his bunk and fell 
instantly asleep. 

After a while it seemed that a 
gentle rocking motion aroused him 
to a semiconscious dream state. A 
part of his mind realized that this 
was an illusion produced within 
sleep, yet some analytical faculty 
remained intrigued by the detail 
inherent in the recurring nightmare. 
Instead of rejecting the situation 
and forcing himself awake, he 
allowed himself to follow the fan- 



tasy. It started with an almost com- 
plete absence of tactile sensation, 
as though his mind had become 
insulated from his body or his body 
from reality. Yet he was aware of 
the ripple and eddy of a gentle tide 
that bore him over black waters. 

The impression deepened until it 
achieved the status of reality. There 
was no light, but the fidelity with 
which the elements of the pattern 
came together was so consistent 
as to be perfectly believable. He 
could hear the slight wash and lap 
of small ripples against the tunnel 
walls and the quick near-ultrasonic 
echoes that gave proportion to the 
dark tunnel down which he was 
being drawn. Somewhere ahead a 
phantom goose was piping through 
a layer of slime with a plaintive 
concern that had no human 
associations. 

A sudden bend in the impossible 
river made itself clearly felt as his 
imaginary raft fouled some jagged 
corner and swung him around be- 
fore allowing the dark sluice to 
carry him on. Somewhere on his 
way the solitary glutinous goose 
was joined by another and then by 
an increasing number to raise a 
harrowing hymn that filled him 
with a cold horror. Another bend, 
and this time he clearly felt the 
bump against the bank. .felt the 
bump. .on his suit. 

Suit? His shocked fingers ex- 
plored, found slight seams in the 
inner lining of heavy gloves. His 
whole body confirmed the sug- 



154 



IF 




gestion that his earlier lack of 
sensation had been the combined 
effect of his being confined in the 
padded recesses of an exceptionally 
heavy-duty spacesuit and of a 
numbness of the flesh, presumably 
from his having lain in one position 
overlong. These factors, plus a light 
gravity and the buoyancy of the 
fluid in which he floated face up, 
explained his lack of tactile sensa- 
tion and his appreciation of the 
direction and motion of the tide. 
Nothing explained, though, why he 
was conscious of the detail of so 
unlikely a situation — or what dia- 
bolical things were waiting for him 
around those stygian bends. 

The goose-mutter rose into a 
braying scream, a chorus of dissent, 
accusation, rebuke. The quality of 
the dreadful sound alone would 
have been sufficient to make him 
flee from the encounter had he been 
able to control his actions. As it 
was, floating on his back in a nearly 
unmaneuverable suit, he had no 
more power to resist his journey 
than if he had been an upturned 
beetle in a racing gutter stream. 
Hundreds of millions of years of 
fear and hatred were being vocally 
compressed into a jarring anthem 
of complaint and the bitterest of 
reproaches by something that 
waited for him around the final 
turn of the river. 

Panic swamped his reason. He 
struggled against the encumbering 
suit, fretting at his inability to move, 
his arms. Restrained and helpless. 



he waited with dreadful anticipa- 
tion as the inexorable tide bore him 
around the curve. Overhead a mil- 
lion pressures leaned their dark 
depressions on the tunnel roof. The 
air he was breathing was hot and 
moist with the sweat from his fear 
and so tainted by metal and plastic^ 
that it soured his tongue. At any 
moment now he would emerge to 
face persecutors who had planned 
his murder at a time when life on 
Terra had still been struggling for 
an identity separate from the non- 
living elements of the primeval 
soup. 

H e had no idea of what their 
faces or forms would be like, 
but he doubted that his sanity 
would stand the revelation. The 
scolding choir was now so near 
that he felt he ought to be able to 
stretch out and touch the violent 
and anguished creatures. He felt 
there ought to be a light— but he 
could discern none at all. Then 
another voice crept in, quieter at 
first, but gradually pulling at him 
with such urgency that he had to 
turn toward it regardless of suit or 
geese or the drag of the unknown 
tide. 

Perhaps in the sordid cells of 
some inhuman inquisition a spirit 
snapped. 

“Jaycee, help me!” 

... the mind mazed not by the 
sear in steel, the nibblin nerve. 

“Jaycee, for God’s sake, get me 
out of here!”

. but by a vaster wound. 
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT 
GOD IS DYIN' . DYIN' . 

“Jaycee, I don’t know a blessed 
thing abdut God, but get me out 
of this.” 

You're coming out, Bron. Hold 
on a little longer. Your metabolism 
is improvin' fast and your heart- 
beat's almost back to normal. 

Bron opened his eyes. An oxygen 
mask was pressed across his face 
and beyond it the concerned 
eyes of a medic were watching him 
anxiously. As he focused his vision 
he found he was no longer in his 
bunk but on an operating table in 
the Skua's medical bay. 

“What happened, Jaycee?” 

You went into a coma about 
seventeen hours ago. The medics 
tried to pull you out but were un- 
successful. Finally I had to use the 
semantic trigger to force you 
around, because your body pro- 
cesses were running dangerously 
low. I've been in contact with 
Ananias and we were about to 
authorize a heart massage. 

“I had that dream again, Jaycee. 
The one where I’m floating in a 
tunnel and the aliens are waiting 
for me. I’ve got one more curve to 
go before I meet whatever they 
are — ” 

The aliens haven't given up yet, 
Bron. You've beaten their fleet, but 
they've established some other 
method of gettin at you. Somehow 
they're workin on your mind. 

“Those alien signals on the 



transfer link. Can you still hear 
them?” 

Stronger than ever. Antares is 
filterin' them out for us, but they're 
still cornin' in. 

“The alien fleet signals faded 
toward the end of the battle. What 
we’re getting now must be long- 
range stuff from the alien’s point 
of origin. It’s some sort of encoded 
imagery transmitted as sound. It 
seems to be their form of commu- 
nication. I can even grasp pictures 
from it myself at times. But when 
I’m relaxed the effect can be quite 
hypnotic.” 

That computes. Your coma was 
consistent with the effect of ultra- 
deep hypnosis. That explores levels 
of consciousness down to about 
what we used for the Haltern char- 
acter synthesis. It's dangerous 
territory to leave exposed to the use 
of an enemy. 

“I don’t feel this as an attack. 
I feel it^s some attempt at 
communication.” 

They're just tryin to kill you, 
Bron. Plain old-fashioned murder. 

“No. It’s more than that, Jaycee. 
That dream place is real — it’s a 
projection of an actual physical 
situation. To survive there requires 
a heavy-duty spacesuit — which sug- 
gests that it’s a very hot place. The 
gravity is only about half Terra- 
normal. It has an atmosphere — I 
could hear transmitted sounds. It 
also has a hydrosphere — I was 
floating on some of it. I didn’t 
dream those things, Jaycee. They 



156

were communicated to me. It’s an 
actual place— somewhere.” 

If it does exist it*s in Messier 
thirty-one — right across the void. 
But I dont see why its existence is 
in any way important. 

“It is, though. I’ve got to go 
there, Jaycee. That dream was a 
sample of visualized chaos. My 
journey down that tunnel is an al- 
ready established part of future 
history.” 

Youve altered chaos trends 
before, Bron, so what makes this 
one immutable? 

“Because all we’ve beaten out 
here is a few dozen individuals and 
an uncommonly antique spacefleet. 
The real enemy is still untouched 
and probably just as virulent as 
ever. If they could put a hellburner 
down on Onaris, they could as 
easily put one on Terra or any of 
the other prime worlds. In fact, 
those burners may already be on 
their way. If we’re ever to win 
totally I have to carry the fight to 
them. And that dream, Jaycee, is 
a prediction of some part of the 
result of my doing just that.” 



ANANIAS, how many ships 
have you with the potential 
subspace capability to take them to 
Messier thirty-one?” 

Ananias whistled as he caught the 
implications of the question. “It’s 
never been done, Bron. Not right 
across the void. The Tantalus went 
farther out than any other vessel 



ever did before— and even that was 
only a fraction of the distance.” 
“This time I want to go right 
across. Give me details of any 
Commando ship with a known 
subspace-jump capability of better 
than ten kiloparsecs.” 

“But you’re talking about six 
hundred kiloparsecs. No ship has 
that capability.” 

“No ship has attempted it, so we 
don’t know. I want ships, as well 
as volunteer crews to man them. 
We’ve carried out a review of all 
Destroyer ships and we think we 
may have three with that sort of 
subspace potential. I’d prefer to 
have thrity.” 

“Engaged, Bron. I’ll run a com- 
puter check immediately. If we’ve 
any candidates I’ll let you know.” 
“Jaycee, are you there?” 

No. Doc on-line. Deep-space 
Research Labs have just returned a 
verdict that there* s barely a two 
percent possibility of any ship of 
known design reaching Messier 
thirty-one. After about fifteen 
kiloparsecs the subspace dropout 
determination becomes so impre- 
cise that dropout probability ap- 
proaches null infinity. There s no 
record of anything* s having jumped 
more than fifteen kiloparsecs and 
having returned to real-space. 

“At two percent possibility it’s 
still a risk I’m prepared to take. If 
necessary we’ll take the distance in 
a number of small jumps.” 

That won^ help. You cant fix 
dropout coordinates in an area 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



157 




M^here there are no stars to use as 
reference points, 

“We’ll manage somehow. Doc. 
It’s got to be done.” 

I still dont see what you expect 
to achieve if you get there. You 
cant take an army with you and the 
star population of Andromeda is 
even larger than that of our own 
galaxy. The odds are several 
hundred thousand million to one 
against your even locating the right 
primary, let alone the alien 
homeworld. 

“I’m taking a chaos crew with 
me. It’s estimated that we can get a 
fair chaos fix from examining the 
origins of the alien fleet. That 
should give us some idea of the 
sector. From there it will be a 
matter of making astronomical 
correction for galactic drift and 
rotation.” 

You re in charge, Bron. If you 
want to try it we cant stop you. 
But from where we*re sitting it 
seems a foolish waste of mqn and 
ships. 

“Objection noted, Doc. But I 
have to play the game my way. Is 
Jaycee there?” 

Shes off duty. Want me to put 
out a call? 

“No. Just describe her to me.” 

You know I cant do that, Bron. 
You dont really expect an answer. 

“I fail to see what’s so damn 
secret about the description of 
someone who spends half her life 
practicing bitchiness inside my 
head.” 



The information s secret for the 
specific reason that we dont want 
you to know. The two of you were 
psychologically paired to establish 
a strongly antagonistic relationship. 
As anticipated, youve achieved 
a high degree of rapport — one 
not complicated by common 
sentiment. It makes you two the 
best operating team we\e got. 
That's why we wont allow anything 
to upset it. 

Bron was amused. “Like falling 
in love, for instance?” 

Don't underestimate the power 
of the coupling between you two, 
Bron. You're more tightly keyed 
together, except physically, than 
two people could be in any normal 
relationship. You wouldn't get a 
weld that thorough even in a clqssic 
love match. 

“Tell me more. Doc.” 

I've told you too much already. 
From now on questions about 
Jaycee won't be answered. I just 
wanted to show you how delicate 
the balance is. 

“I think you’ve shown me a 
whole lot more than that. I think 
you’ve just reshaped a big piece of 
future history.” 

Bron moved across the Skua's 
bridge to a computer input termi- 
nal. His fingers sought their posi- 
tions on the keyboard, but his eyes 
avoided watching wfiat his fingers 
were conveying to the keys. His 
gaze remained firhily fixed on the 
instruments across the room. 

What are you doing, Bron? I 



158 



IF 




think we ought to have a record of 
that. 

“Stay out of my hair, Doc. This 
whole assignment’s out of your 
control. Regardless of your advice, 
I’m going to Messier thirty-one. 
And if I survive I’m coming back to 
tackle the galaxy’s other great 
enigma.” 

And what the hell is that? 

“Doc, I’m coming back for 
Jaycee. And it’ll take more than the 
Stellar Commando to stop me.” 

D eftly, subtly, the thunder 
of the gravity drives died and 
the six ships jumped into the 
dimensionless corridors of tachyon 
space. Every time they reached the 
quiescent phase of a jump, Bron 
quit the jump harness and began to 
plot more detail into his new ven- 
ture, The Destroyer corvette 
Nemesis was only a fraction of the 
size of the Skua, but its subspace 
installation was the most powerful 
in the fleet. Alongside, but invisible 
now, two other Destroyer ships and 
three from the Commando fleet 
sang their eerie way through the 
superluminal continuum. 

Down in the hastily conceived 
chaos complex of the Nemesis, a 
volunteer crew of technicians 
worked steadily at the task of pin- 
pointing with increasing definition 
the origin of the alien armada. 
The grinning imp in charge of the 
fantastic improvisation was none 
other than Academician Laaris, 
formerly of the Tantalus, who 



presided with troll-like exhilaration 
over the most detailed and exacting 
chaos determination ever made. 

Lacking the usual stars for sub- 
space reference, the coordinates 
set up in the subspace grids were 
based on Laaris’s increasingly 
hardening chaos values for the 
path of the alien fleet as he back- 
tracked it through space and time. 
Bron was keeping his fingers 
crossed. When setting up subspace 
coordinates, the use of theoretical 
chaos positions instead of a replica 
star matrix was a risky and untried 
procedure. So far the six ships had 
taken seven leaps of fifty thousand 
parsecs and had arrived virtually 
simultaneously and without inci- 
dent. This was so far at variance 
with the statistical odds of such 
long-range subspace operations 
that all those involved were con- 
scious of living on borrowed time. 

It was Laaris who first noted a 
peculiarity in the chaos-predicted 
routing. Refusing to accept Bron as 
anything other^ than Haltern the 
master syncretist, he continually 
brought to him the most obscure 
chaos problems for explanation. 
Partly with Ander’s help and partly 
from his own improving under- 
standing of chaos mechanisms, 
Bron usually managed to produce a 
satisfactory answer. This time 
Laaris knew that he had found a 
problem to end all chaos problems, 
and his delight at the finding was 
equalled only by his concern for its 
possible consequences.

^^Mastership 'altern, this you ’ave 
to explain to me/' He unrolled a 
dozen chartstrips on the table 
and waited with impatient expec- 
tancy while Bron examined them in 
detail. 

“What's the problem?" asked 
Bron. 

“This divergence." Laaris indi- 
cated the computer comments 
running down the edge of the strip. 
“The farther we go, the more our 
course diverges from a straight 
line." 

“Which surely only indicates 
that the path of the alien fleet was 
similarly curved?" 

“Not so! We should be proceed- 
ing down straight coinciden' axis 
from resultant to origin. This is a 
geocentric line — he got no damn 
right to bend.” 

“What about the time factor?" 
asked Bron. “With the rotation and 
drift of the Andromeda galaxy 
through the years, surely our 
course must curve as we backtrack 
the alien ships through time. The 
best fix we can expect chaos to 
achieve is the position of the point 
of origin as it was seven hundred 
million years ago." 

Laaris hopped from one foot to 
the other in sheer exasperation. 

“I already 'ave explained. Chaos 
axis always straight line. You 
confuse it with space-time where 
you can 'ave your curvature. In 
chaos all shock-spheres are 
spherical and all axes straight. She 
don’ work no other way." 



Bron examined the chartstrips 
again, noting the computed tensor- 
ial factors thronging the margin of 
the record. 

“Since it does appear axiomatic 
that all chaos axes are straight, 
while our course is not, the logical 
inference would seem to be that the 
factors we are feeding into our 
computers are not true chaos 
determinations." 

“Do you doubt our detectors?" 
Laaris was immediately on the 
defensive. 

“Of course not. I know you — 
and you would have checked them 
before you brought this to me. 
It’s the entropic data itself that I 
suspect. How possible is it that 
we’re being fed a signal our detec- 
tors Find indistinguishable from the 
ripples of a real event?" 

Laaris rubbed his brow. “It’s 
only a question of signal strength. 
Any signal indistinguishable from a 
true event process would be handled 
as though it were an event process. 
If it swamped the original signal 
we might never know of substitu- 
tion. Why you ask?" 

“Because it has just occured to 
me," said Bron, “that we perhaps 
aren’t searching for the aliens — 
we’re being led to them."

Vve had Ander on-line since 



160 



IF 




Laaris came to see you. He says 
modified entropic transmission 
techniques are both feasible and 
actually in use for instantaneous 
communications over galactic 
distances. In fact, a form of entro- 
pic transmission is used in the 
transfer link itself. 

“Then we could be riding down 
some alien homing beam we are 
mistaking for an event axis?” 

Affirmative, Bron. With their 
technology anythin is possible. 

The break-jump alert signaled 
termination of the present traverse 
through subspace, and shortly Bron 
was immersed in the intricate 
agonies of re-entry. A sudden en- 
counter with a burst of startled 
alien goose-mutter filled him with 
apprehension. Since his induced 
coma aboard the Skua the voices 
had not been raised to a detectable 
level, though he always now took 
anti-hypnotic drugs before he slept 
as an insurance against recurrence. 

It took the ship’s radio officer 
scant seconds to identify the at- 
tendant catastrophe. Two of their 
companion ships had failed to 
make the dropout. A slight pos- 
sibility existed that the missing 
ships would revert to real-space at 
some point in the near future and in 
some place far removed from their 
intended destination. More prob- 
ably they had joined that lost 
legion of ships doomed to spend 
forever in the weird, dimensionless 
corridors of the subspace mode. 

Bron called a radio conference 



of his ships’ captains while the 
next jump was being programed. 
At their present rate, four more 
subspace jumps of fifty kiloparsecs 
each were required to complete the 
journey to the fringes of the 
Andromeda galaxy. Each jump 
bore its own possibility of failed 
dropout. The statistical odds of 
survival had already been stretched 
heavily. Bron decided to try the 
last two hundred kiloparsecs in 
one jump. Nobody dissented, 
though they all knew that they were 
playing in an area of physics where 
they had no qualifications whatever. 

Laaris soon produced evidence 
of a pure entropic transmission 
of such an intensity that it com- 
pletely obliterated his normal 
chaos determinations. Although 
the trap was now painfully obvious, 
Bron ordered the indicated route to 
be set up in the subspace grids. 
Where there was an alien beacon, 
he reasoned, there also would be 
the most likely place to find aliens. 
All coordinates were double- and 
triple-checked, and the four ships 
jumped into subspace. 

When she finally reached the 
dropout point, the Nemesis was 
alone, 

B ron had to admit to curiously 
mixed feelings as his lone 
craft hit real-space at the edge of 
the great galaxy of Andromeda. 
Fear, anxiety and regret for the loss 
of his companion ships were para- 
mount, but wonder was not the 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



161 




least of his emotions. He had 
ranged broadly through the Milky 
Way and knew something of the 
infinite variety of its stars. Super- 
ficially these stars in Andromeda 
were of similar range in size, type, 
spectrum and density of distribu- 
tion. Yet never could his own eyes 
have convinced him that these were 
the stars of home. In some in- 
definable way the magnificent 
array seemed ineffably unique 
and foreign. 

Perhaps Andromeda indeed 
was different — among all the 
stars and planets in the Milky 
Way only Terra had detectably 
produced intelligent life. Now, on 
the edge of another galaxy, he 
was destined to meet the alien 
equivalent of Man. His fleet now 
trimmed to a solitary ship by 
precalculated circumstance, he 
knew that when he came around 
that last bend in the tunnel he 
would be both defenseless and 
alone. Alone before a life form 
that had acquired space capability 
back when the first alarms of 
life had begun to shrill on Terra. 

“Listen, you out there,” he said, 
suddenly struck by the thought 
that the aliens probably could 
intercept his transfer link. “I 
know you’re listening.” 

The goose-mutter rose to 
audibility, then descended again 
below threshold value, almost as 
if in answer. 

Bron continued, “I’m coming 
down to meet you. You’ve des- 



troyed many of our worlds without 
apparent reason. If I wanted I 
could destroy many more of yours, 
since I have access to ships that 
can cross the void in mere fractions 
of a lifetime. Therefore I come 
out of strength, n,ot out of weak- 
ness. I shall not bear weapons, but 
if I or my ship comes to harm the 
rest of my kind will know of it and 
you will be destroyed because of 
it.” 

Again the goose-mutter rose like 
the waves of an angry sea, then 
hushed to a background noise like 
surf on a distant shore. 

Laaris came in with his latest 
calculations. He was now able to 
pinpoint the source of entropic 
noise. It appeared to originate from 
a system only two kiloparsecs in 
from the alien Rim. Bron 

authorized the jump and, after the 
computers had run an astronom- 
ical survey to establish a true 

replica star matrix, the Nemesis 

slid into subspace on her terminal 
jump. 

It emerged in the vicinity of a 
perfectly ordinary K5 primary of 
about eighty percent of the mass 
of Sol. It had only one planet, 
which was smaller than Terra. 

Telescopic examination of what 
little could be seen of the planet’s 
surface revealed nothing signifi- 
cant. It was a craggy rock-ball, 
cloudbound, apparently lifeless, 
and with a boiling and turbulent 
hydrocarbon atmosphere. The 
temperature of its surface was in 



162 



IF 




excess of two hundred degrees 
Celsius. The alien entropic signal 
was originating from some region 
of the unfriendly terrain, but the 
limited discrimination of the jury- 
rigged scanners on the Nemesis 
failed to resolve the location except 
in the broadest terms. 

The Nemesis carried only one 
scoutcraft, a pinnace. Bron ordered 
heavy-duty spacesuits to be broken 
out and called for two volunteers 
to accompany him. The volunteers 
came readily. When Bron in- 
spected the suit with which he had 
been provided, he knew that his 
journey down that dreadful 
tunnel was all too soon to become 
reality. 

H aving been built primarily 
for deep-space work, the 
pinnace was unhappy in any kind 
of atmosphere. It proved especially 
so in the vapor-laden hydrocarbon 
storms it now entered. Unable to 
use its thrust motors efficiently 
at such low speeds and having an 
inadequate aerodynamic form 
for achieving stability in boiling 
multi-fractioned mineral-oil vapors, 
the craft stalled, balked and was 
buffeted by sidewinds, convection 
currents and wax-laden down- 
draughts. 

Occasionally, through a hail 
of platelets of crystalline higher- 
paraffin snow, Bron saw the surface 
of the planet. He gazed with amaze- 
ment at the vicious rocky crags 
swept by an oily, droplet-loaded 



wind and at the sullen swell of a 
liquid metal sea. The land masses 
were spitefully fragmented, broken 
islands and torn peaks reflecting 
the atrocious vehemence of un- 
earthly Nature. Here and there 
vast mountain ranges seemed to 
have been torn out by the roots 
and tossed sideways to shatter 
into razor-sharp rocks and black, 
impenetrable fissures. Nowhere 
was there any sign of the restora- 
tionvof order that would indicate 
intelligent intervention. 

Bron and his volunteers made 
three sorties in the pinnace, re- 
turning to the Nemesis to rest, 
recalibrate their instruments and 
discharge their records for process- 
ing. Laaris was operating all the 
computer power he had at his 
command, trying to equate the 
varying alien signal strength with 
some aspect of the geometry of the 
planet. The information from their 
low-level nights was beginning to 
match up to a pattern of coinci- 
dences, indicating at first a point on 
the southern hemisphere, then 
gradually tightening to a particular 
land mass and finally to coordi- 
nates indicating an area a bare 
kilometer in diameter. 

Bron called for aerial photo- 
graphs and both high- and low- 
level sets were matched to give a 
reasonable facsimile of the area. 
Bron’s hands were shaking as he 
took the finished prints. Some alien 
description of the place he had not 
admitted to his consciousness sud-

denly burst into recognition. He 
knew instinctively how to interpret 
the patterns of light and darkness. 
He realized that all this had been 
described to him in the deep hyp- 
notic coma he had experienced on 
the Skua. On his awakening he had 
remembered only the traumatic 
moments leading to the point where 
he had been torn away from the 
encounter just before the climax. 
Now he was back at the beginning 
of the journey — and this time he 
felt sure he was destined to go right 
through to the end. 

“Jaycee!” 

Readin you, Bron. 

“Give me a readout of the secon- 
dary circuits on the transfer link.” 
Why? You thinkin of takin a 
holiday? 

“I said read them, Jaycee.” 

Very well. Catatonic Withdrawal. 
Anesthesia with Maintained Con- 
sciousness, Punishment, Death. 
What you meanin , Bron? 

Bron held up a print and pointed 
to- a shadowed area that bore no 
detail. 

“That’s the entrance to the 
tunnel, Jaycee. I’m going down 
there. Unless I miss my guess it’s 
going to be a rough journey. You’ve 
got six hours to prepare. Get some 
rest. Once we start. I’ll be needing 
all the back-up you give me.” 

XXI 

T he pinnace made a precarious 
touchdown on the only avail- 



able flat space in the area. The 
landing was a classic example of 
triumph over bitter odds. All the 
way down through the troposphere, 
the heavy methane winds had buf- 
feted the craft and repeatedly sent 
it keeling dangerously off course. 
Storm-walls — sheets of condensing 
hydrocarbon polymers — wrapped 
themselves around the optical navi- 
gation systems and made nonsense 
of the readings of the laser altim- 
eters. The embarrassingly high 
charge of static the pinnace had 
acquired had to be carefully bled 
away with sodium plasma before 
the craft dared approach closely the^ 
eutectic metal sea. 

Finally, however, the landing was 
achieved. Flexing slightly on its 
cushioned legs under the pressures 
of the storm, the craft stood with 
nose pointed longingly toward the 
quietude of space. Its carefully 
chosen position was atop a black 
flat-topped rock that protruded like 
a miniature island from the dull 
metallic sea. From the incidence of 
surrounding rocks it was obvious 
that the ocean here was actually no 
more than the fringes of a tide 
eroding a broken coastal shelf. 

The sweeping metal surf ham- 
mered the black rock with an 
inertial insistence unnerving to 
contemplate. The shock of the wave 
impact was easily felt inside the 
shuddering ship. A tide with a 
density of eight, and a temperature 
of two hundred degrees Celsius, 
was no mean wash. 



164 



IF 




A hundred meters away, a moun- 
tain cavern opened like a black 
mouth in a twisted misshapen head. 
By some mechanism yet to be 
explained, a strong tidal current 
entered the cavern but was subject 
to no apparent reverse of flow. 
Whatever entered the dark galleries 
tended to remain. 

Your aptitude for most of the 
weaknesses of the flesh is proven 
beyond doubt. Jaycee was darkly 
critical. Unfortunately your capac- 
ity for successful suicide has never 
yet been established. Is that the 
place? 

“We know the signals are coming 
from this area and the stream enter- 
ing the cave seems to equate with 
the dream.” 

So what do you plan to do? 

“I’m going in there, Jaycee.” 

With a task force? 

“No. Just me, with you along.” 

I dont get your motive, Bron. 
It*s a suicide trip even without 
aliens. Look at the strength of that 
current. What you tryin to prove? 

“My journey down there is al- 
ready part of history. I have to 
know what’s beyond that last 
bend.” 

Level with me, Bron. You re no 
martyr and you re not riskin your 
fool neck in the interests of inter- 
stellar relationships. It isnt hero- 
ism and ifs not just idle curiosity. 
You re too damn egotistic and self- 
centered to care about the rest of 
the universe. If you re going down 
that tunnel ifs because you’ve a 



pretty good idea there’s something 
you think you want at the end of it 
and you’re reasonably sure you’re 
goin to be able to take it with you. 
I can’t see how you figure it, but as 
sure as hellJ’m curious. 

“You know what your trouble is, 
Jaycee? You’ve got no soul.” 

And you know what your trouble 
is, Bron? You’re runnin remark- 
ably short of future. 

B ron watched the fearful scene 
for many minutes before he 
began to make his move. At last he 
quit the pinnace. The terrifying 
pressures outside stiffened the heat 
resistant suit and made it even more 
cumbersome, especially since he 
had to walk'across the broken rocks 
above the tide-race without being 
able properly to see the areas to 
which he committed his feet. 

His journey through the terrible 
atmosphere was like that of a deep- 
sea diver caught in some undersea 
vortex. It was a moot point as to 
whether his own volition or the 
barbarous physics of the place was 
most responsible for taking him 
into the entrance to the cave, but he 
had a distinct feeling that even the 
wind was conspiring to make him 
enter. 

Keep goin’, Bron. I’m ridin with 
you. Jaycee’s voice was a welcome 
touch of reality in the nightmare. 

“How are the life-support sys- 
tems doing, Jaycee?” 

The suit appears adequate for 
about ten hours if you don’t dam- 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS

age it. We* re not as certain that you 
can stand that length of confine- 
ment. If you get claustrophobic 
youll likely do yourself some 
damage. 

“You know how to quiet me if 1 
get that bent.” 

It would be a pleasure — and not 
for the first time. You always were 
a psychological mess. Her words 
carried the edge of disgust. 

He was well inside the cavern 
mouth now, trying to use the suit’s 
inbuilt lighting to define his way. 
The jet-black of the rock refused to 
throw back any useful definition 
and only the racing metal stream 
showed up as a wide, glittering tide 
under a roof that progressively 
lowered toward an enigmatic 
somewhere. 

Then he heard it. The goose- 
mutter, this time coming via the 
suit phones, not the transfer link. 
From somewhere impossibly far 
away he could hear the glutinous 
cries and knew from their urgency 
that they had detected his coming. 
He also heard Jaycee draw a sharp 
breath of anxiety. 

Shortly he was forced to stop. 
The jagged bank on which he had 
been painfully clambering came to 
an end with the gradual closing of 
the tunnel’s mouth. Experimentally 
he tested the racing stream, hoping 
to strike bottom, but such was its 
depth and density that he was un- 
able to apply sufficient weight to 
force his foot down to the under- 
lyingrock. As if he had extended 



his leg into a torrent of quicksilver, 
the heavy liquid drag tore him loose 
from the precarious handholds and 
with a cry he slipped and fell on his 
back into the eutectic tide. 

As he fell he heard the headlamp 
strike a spiteful point of rock. This 
should not have been able to dam- 
age the lamp, but somehow it 
caused it to cease its solid-state 
illumination. For the first time 
since he had entered the tunnel he 
experienced panic as a full appreci- 
ation of his animal helplessness 
closed about his thinking. He was^ 
being carried face-up along this 
fantastic tunnel that murmured and 
whispered with the ripple and eddy 
of the unalterable metal flood. 

Are you all right, Bron? 

Her voice brought back objectiv- 
ity. “I’m still afloat — if you’re 
awarding any points for buoyancy. 
But that’s about the sum of my 
assets at this point.” 

Believe me, you re not jokin. 
Aliens or no aliens, you know 
youve got no chance of ever gettin 
back out of there. So precisely what 
you up to, Bron? 

“Would you believe that I’m not 
up to anything?” 

No! I know you for the scheming 
wretch you are. 

“Then I’ll tell you what’s on my 
mind. I’m accepting that dream 
imagery as being a piece of visual- 
ized chaos. I regard it as proof that 
I did — will — somehow penetrate 
right into this place. Right up to 
the point where the aliens are.” 



166 



IF 




But you dont know what hap- 
pens beyond that point. 

“No, except that it’s axiomatic 
that this expedition must be 
successful.’’ 

Where in space did you conjure 
that piece of wishful thinking? 

“My dear Jaycee, it’s been im- 
plicit in everything the aliens have 
done. The hellburners, the armada, 
were all in some way aimed at 
lessening the probability of this 
contact’s ever being made. All 
those years ago they tried to avert 
the happening that is soon to take 
place. They would scarcely have 
gone to those lengths to prevent 
something that was going to 
fail anyway. Therefore it has to 
succeed.” 

/ dont see it that way, Bron. I 
think theyve tried every way they 
know to destroy the chaos factor 
you represent. All their long-range 
attacks failed because of miscal- 
culation, so theyve induced you to 
come to them. I think you re in a 
one-way chaos disposal unit. As I 
read it, theyve got you in a trap 
that will become increasingly lethal 
until the chaos potential you rep- 
resent is utterly destroyed. 

“I don’t agree, Jaycee. But even 
if you’re right, they’ve already 
failed.” 

What you meanin, Bron? 

“A point you and they may have 
overlooked. I’m not just an individ- 
ual. Through the transfer link I’m 
a composite being, a gestalt synthe- 
sis of me, you, your computing and 



communications complex and such 
characters as Doc, Ander and 
Ananias. The aliens might destroy 
me, but the rest of the gestalt 
remains with all the original knowl- 
edge and purpose untouched. Get 
yourself a new agent and nothing 
has been lost but a few kilos of 
replaceable protein. You see, it 
isn’t just me who’s the catalyst, but 
the whole system of which I happen 
to be a part.” 

Quit talkin, Bron. Vm turnin up 
the audio gain. Sounds like a 
waterfall or rapids ahead. Whafs 
the current like? 

“Seems to be pulling harder, but 
there’s not much I can judge it by.” 
See if you can strike a bank and 
wedge on it. Accordin to our 
instruments, that fall ahead is 
really vicious. 

“How vicious?” 

We could be well adrift because 
we dont know the full range of 
physical parameters, but we* re 
readin a probable drop ap- 
proachin* three kilometers. 

“Jaycee — ” 

Yes? 

“Nothing. What are the chances 
of surviving that?” 

If you were a jelly I*d rate the 
prospect at one percent. However, 
as a vertebrate — 

“Will the suit hold?” 

Depends what you hit. Most 
probably not. Some of the life- 
support systems wont stand that 
sort of deceleration anyway.

He felt a bump. In an agonized 
reappraisal of the sensations that 
reached his cocooned form he knew 
he was in free fall and plunging 
through a dark hiatus that seemed 
to be limited only by eternity. From 
somewhere far below, the angry 
sound of violently agitated fluids 
rushed up to meet him. Un- 
ashamedly he screamed and, as he 
continued to fall, the scream be- 
came frozen on his lips.

and yet others in an inhuman 
anthem distilled from terror and 
corrodingly bitter reproaches. 

Overhead, the pressures of 
seven hundred million years of 



evolution leaned against the 
tunneled rock. His lungs were 
refusing to accept the tainted, 
metal-tasting air and he could hear 
his own sweat dripping about his 
ears. The inability to feel or move 
his arms and legs brought him 
quickly to the verge of hysteria. 
Another bend and this time he 
clearly felt the bump against the 
bank. .felt the bump. .on his

Rid in with you, Bron. 

“The fall didn’t kill me, then?” 

We threw you into catatonic 
shock. You went down easier that 
way. Actually it wasnt quite as bad 
as we thought. The height was 
broken by a cascade of about 
seventeen falls. You re about three 
kilometers deep now and the level 
is still fallin. Weve got you under 
conscious anesthesia at the moment 
because we didnt know how badly 
you may have been mashed by the 
falls. 

“Lift the anesthesia, Jaycee, I’d 
like to find out.” 

A transparent hum filled his head 
for a moment, then painful feeling 
flooded into his limbs. 

How you feelin, Bron? 

“Doubt if I’ve an unstrained joint 
anywhere, but nothing seems to be 
broken.” 

Apparently the suit was becomin 
more rigid as the depth-pressure 
increased. Ifs more of a casin now. 
Talk about the devil lookin after

“Can you hear the aliens, Jay- 
cee?” 

We*ve been plottin sound inten- 
sities. Accordin to our calculations 
you re goin to be meetin them in 
about seven minutes. 

The goose-mutter grew into a 
vast, brassy braying, a throbbing 
crescendo of sound that struck back 
from the tunnel walls in a rippled 
anacamptic roar. The scolding 
choir was now so near that he felt 
he was almost in its midst. Another 
bump and he knew he had rounded 
the last of the dreadful bends. This 
time he was in no dream. There was 
no possibility of recall from the 
edge of nightmare. 

This was reality. 

He felt the stream slacken and 
heard echoes become attenuated by 
distance, as though he had entered 
a larger cavern. And then came 
light, a dim luminescence, straight 
glowing bars along level walls — and 
a sudden terrifying silence. 

His back came to rest against an 
inclined tracery grille in which he 
found he could catch his heel and 
force himself up out of the eutectic 
sluice. He looked about him in dim 
amazement, warily prepared to 
meet his persecutors, no matter 
how terrible their form. But he 
found he was shockingly alone. 

The metallic stream ran between 
straight and artificial banks, inter- 
rupted only by the fret on which he 
had laboriously climbed. Looking 
about, he found himself in a vast 
chamber whose distant and com- 

PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



plex walls were covered by a thou- 
sand unguessable patterns that 
might have been either decorative 
or functional. Tall machines lurked 
like mute watchers in alcoves, the 
designs of which were mind- 
wrenching in the unearthly tenets 
of their forms. The machines were 
huge, silent and completely alien 
to him in purpose and concept. 
They were frightening in their 
strangeness. 

H e froze in horror at a 
movement from within the 
ranks of dark and unknown mech- 
anisms. A familiar and plaintive 
cry rang out and chilled him to the 
marrow. Alien living shapes, dark 
in the sparse light, goose-stepped 
out from some unanticipated place 
and moved in profiled files — delib- 
erately to the stream to drink. 

He watched them curve horny 
bills incuriously into the metal 
stream — and just as incuriously 
waddle past his silent form, pro- 
testing some unknown indignity but 
oblivious to his presence. With 
mounting horror and increasing 
comprehension, he watched them 
go— degenerate, blind, ugly, leath- 
ery, alien and completely stupid 
quasi-aviforms — they nested, fed 
and presumably br^ in this trea- 
surehouse of a lost culture. Even 
their prehensile hands had atro- 
phied in favor of a broad bill and a 
long, thrusting neck. 

The whole chamber had the 
feeling of a cathedral — but in honor 



169 




of what dead gods? There were a 
million clues but no answers. Bron 
realized the irony and incongruity 
of the announcing choir of voices. 
Once their hyms had held much 
meaning. Now their race neared an 
evolutionary end and their personal 
complaint had dwindled from cos- 
mic considerations to a local spat 
about the infrequency of worms. 
While an alien phonograph had 
piped something from the pinnacle 
of their once-held greatness. 

With returning confidence Bron 
started to explore. Some of the 
mechanisms had strange lights 
playing inside them, the lumi- 
nescence even yet moving as though 
to perform some intelligent func- 
tion even though the whole place 
was possessed by the stamp of in- 
credible age. One machine, as he 
approached it, began to speak in 
a welter of the familiar goose- 
mutter, but softly, as if its resigned 
and sibilant speech were now a 
message of acquiescence, ar» apol- 
ogy for its previous paeans of hate. 
He regarded it uneasily, sensing 
that it was conscious of his presence 
and knowing that this was the voice 
that had menaced his dreams and 
probably directed the attack detail 
of the alien fleet. Now the machine 
acknowledged his mastery, but he 
felt no sense of triumph. 

Where are the aliens, Bron? 

“The kind we came to meet don’t 
exist any more, Jaycee. They’re 
extinct.” 

But they attacked us! 



“The far ancestors of these crea- 
tures did, but they faded and forgot 
us many millions of years ago. Per- 
haps there were a few live carcasses 
in the fleet, but they had long since 
lost their sense of purpose. Only 
machines carried out that nearly 
mindless battle.” 

can you be so sure the aliens 
dont exist? 

“Evolution, Jaycee. The fact that 
they achieved intelligence is a proof 
that they were evolving organisms. 
It took only about four million 
years for man to swing out of the 
trees and boost himself into space. 
With the possibility of that rate of 
progress, have you any idea where 
a further six hundred and ninety- 
six million years might take us? 
One thing is certain, we’ll no longer 
be the dominant Homo sapiens. 
The same thing will have happened 
to us as has already happened to 
these aliens.” 

/ hadnt thought of us that way. 

“The development of intelligence 
is a kind of evolutionary critical 
reaction. It’s unstable. The useful- 
ness of intelligence as a long-term 
survival factor is questionable. It’s 
probably not valid for much over 
five million years.” 

But what about the entropic 
beacon that brought you here? 

“The aliens’ ancestors made good 
machines, Jaycee — designed them 
to last an eternity, probably not 
realizing they would have forgotten 
how to use them long before the 
machines wore out. It’s possible the

beacon was their own deep-space 
cominunications link, or perhaps 
it was set up by some latter-day 
alien philosopher to invite anyone 
with the technology and compe- 
tence to come and partake of the 
things they left behind. A sort of 
final memorial. This place — what 
is it? Some kind of museum de- 
signed to demonstrate their techno- 
logical peak to any life form with 
the intelligence and the ability to 
gain admission.” 

But why did they send the armada 
and the hellburners? 

“That’s easily explained. Early 
in their evolution this place may 
have been something special to 
them. Then they read through their 
version of chaos analysis that one 
day an alien creature would stand 
in their special hall and pick it 
clean like a robber at a grave. Not 
realizing they would ultimately 
welcome the approach, they did all 
in their power to stop it. But what- 
ever they did, that creature still 
remained, a positive future specter. 
They didn’t know that their own 
failure — and not we — would de- 
stroy them.” 

You suspected all this before you 
went into the cavern, didnt you? 
Jaycee began to read new meanings 
into Bron’s insistence on finding 
the alien homeworld. 

“I knew they couldn’t survive 
their own evolution over such a 
great period of time. Despite the 
apparent evidence to the contrary, 
there couldn’t still be a functioning 



alien menace. Therefore there had 
to be something else.” 

And that*s the thing you were 
after? 

“Jaycee, these people were tech- 
nologically far in advance of us in a 
great many fields. They could engi- 
neer molecules in the same way 
that we engineer machines. They 
used entropy as competently as we 
use electromagnetism. Imagine a 
fusion of their science with ours. Is 
there anything in the universe that 
would be denied us?” 

And it all belongs to Bron! Jay- 
cee’s bitterness etched every syllable 
with acid. 

“That’s right, Jaycee. One day 
I’m coming back with enough men 
and equipment to open up this 
place and carry away as much of it 
as we have the ability to under- 
stand.” 

Someone may go back, Bron, 
but it wont be you. Youve less 
than three hours* air left in that 
suit. Do you really think you stand 
a chance of getting out of there 
alive? 

“Jaycee, there has to be a way 
out, for the same reason that there 
was a way in. All I need is sufficient 
intelligence to find it in time.” 

O N THE far side of the chamber 
he chanced upon a vast trans- 
parent tank. It was filled with a 
liquid whose misty blueness was 
haunting. His attention caught, he 
studied it more carefully, noting 
the myriad pinpoints of light that 



PATTERNS OF CHAOS 



171 




burned briefly and randomly 
through the faint haze. Occasion- 
ally he detected a slight trail be- 
tween the flickering events and 
realized that he was watching an 
alien analogue of Ander’s model 
of chaos. This was the Rosetta 
stone that could bridge two com- 
pletely alien cultures. Its discovery 
was probably the most potentially 
important entropic event in history. 
If he could grasp its use the science 
of physics would be reborn. 

He gazed with fascination into 
the misty field of the fluid, wonder- 
ing if this were a model of the actual 
universe and if it operated in real- 
time. If so — one of those bright 
sparks might well represent him- 
self. One particularly bright flare 
long illuminated a whole corner of 
the tank, but whether this had sig- 
nificance he would probably never 
know. He had two-and-a-half hours 
of air left and no bbvious way to 
get out. 

Finding the planet, entering the 
chamber via the cavern, compre- 
hending the nature of what he had 
found — all struck Bron as tests to 
determine the qualifications of 
those who sought what the chamber 
contained. The last test was to get 
out alive. Since he had passed the 
others it seemed logical to him that, 
given the right facilities and the 
right knowledge, the last was also 
achievable. Except that here his 
facilities were nil and his knowledge 
was precariously slight. This test 
was perhaps designed to measure 



the assets of the individual and, 
with his failing air supply, it car- 
ried a barbarous time penalty. The 
aliens were choosing their succes- 
sors with meticulous care. 

He turned away from the tank, 
confident in the certainty that a 
way out had to exist. All he had to 
do was find it. To go back against 
the stream was ijnpossible. Equally, 
at a depth of better than three 
kilometers and with a dwindling 
supply of air, he had no hope that 
those he had left on the surface 
would be able to get down to him 
in time. Perhaps, after all, this was 
a one-way disposal unit. 

Bron! Jaycee’s voice came in with 
a sudden burst of alarm. Whafs 
Cana doin with his task force? 

“Exactly what I asked him to, I 
hope.” 

Antares reports a Destroyer task 
force in close orbit. Did you order 
that? 

“Stay off my back, Jaycee. I’ve 
got worries enough as it is.” 

He returned to the study of his 
problem. The metallic stream 
moved on beyond the grille and fell 
smoothly into the bowels of the 
planet. No escape seemed possible 
by that route. 

Bron. A dozen Destroyer heavy 
cruisers are enterin the solar 
system and Space Defense reports 
another fifty on the way. Does 
Cana reckon on attackin’ Terra? 

Bron ignored her. His searchings 
had taken him back toward the 
middle of tlie chamber. The center- 



172 



IF 




piece was a broad and featureless 
pillar rising up to and probably 
into the solid roof. It was unique 
among the exhibits in its lack of 
complexity. In its base was a 
simple hatch opening internally 
and the sheer solidity of the tubular 
walls made him speculate as to 
what sort of pressures the structure 
was made to contain. 

Bron, mil you listen to me, damn 
you? 

“I’m listening, Jaycee.” 

/ know your brand of chaos. Vd 
recognize it anywhere. Did you 
order the destruction of the Antares 
base? 

“Not its destruction, Jaycee — 
only its capture.” 

/ guessed it. But why? 

“It handles the transfer link. If 
I have Antares, Terra has lost 
control over me.” 

You won t get away with it, Bron. 
This is treason and you cant hope 
to win. The Stellar Commando 
will beat Cana clean out of space. 

“The main Commando fleet Is 
out with Ananias. T^y telling that 
to him.” 

T he singular simplicity of the 
pillar set it radically apart from 
the rest of the mechanisms and he 
could see now that its central posi- 
tion made it difficult to miss. The 
contrasts pointed to its enjoying 
some significance, the recognition 
of which trans^cended any mere 
differences in physiology or origin 
of knowledge^ ;|fe w something 

PATTERNS Of^.^HAOS 



designed to appeal uniquely to 
sheer intelligence, however derived. 

For the first time since he had 
entered the cavern Bron permitted 
himself to smile. 

Damn you! Damn you! Jaycee’s 
vehemence cut like a white-hot 
knife. Youve got this all sewn up, 
haven t you? Ananias has taken the 
Commando fleet so far out into the 
void that we cant contact it by 
normal FTL radio. Our only 
chance is by transfer link to the 
Intelligence Radioship — 

“ — and Ananias has control of 
that.” Bron finished the sentence 
for her. “Let’s face it, Jaycee, 
Terran dominance is finished.” 

You re goin to destroy Terra? 
Her voice rose high with incredulity. 

“Quite the contrary. I need her— 
and the other prime worlds. But in 
their proper perspective. -Not as 
fumbling imperial powers, but as 
members of a total union of in- 
habited planets. It’s all part of the 
agreement between Ananias and 
Cana. Terra, her Rim Dependencies 
and the planets of the Destroyer 
Federation, are going to be welded 
into one entity. Terra isn’t going to 
like it, but that’s the way history 
has to go. There’s too much space 
to conquer for mankind to be 
divided.” 

He turned and entered the shaft, 
examining the hatch. It had a 
simple pressure device to hold it 
shut. If there were alien instructions 
regarding its use, he could not dis- 
cern them, but he moved now with 

173 




the blind faith that its function was 
what logic claimed it to be. He 
closed the hatch behind him. 

Immediately a rush of liquid 
metal swirled about his feet and 
began to lift and raise him bodily 
up the shaft. Higher and higher the 
wave lifted him until he began to 
think that the shaft was limitless 
and that by some trick of physics 
he would continue to rise forever. 
Only the occasional brush of his 
suit against the black encasement 
assured him that he was still 
moving upward. 

Bron, Antares has surrendered 
and landing parties are being set 
down. That makes you a traitor. 
Do you know of any reason why I 
shouldnt press the murder button? 

“If you feel you want to you’ll 
have to be quick, Jaycee. The first 
task of that landing party is to 
destroy the transfer-link aerials. 
But if you fail — do you know 
what’s going to happen? I’ll be 
coming back to Terra specifically 
for you — and regardless of the cost. 
I’ve acquired one hell of an empire, 
and when the task of running it 
becomes a little rough — believe me. 
I’m going to need all the help I can 
get. Don’t tell me the role of First 
Lady of the Universe is something 



that doesn’t appeal?’’ 

You know what you are, Bron — 
you re a Godlost egotistical louse. 

“1 figure that makes us two of a 
kind, Jaycee. As I begin to recall it, 
you’re sort of damned yourself.’’ 

Finally there came a change, 
almost undetectable among the 
poor sensations that reached inside 
the suit. Something akin to an 
instinct warned him that he had 
reached his destination. Initially 
nothing appeared to be different. 
Then, on searching carefully, he 
noticed faint points of light over- 
head. In a shock of reorientation he 
knew that he was looking at the 
stars. Somewhere, one of those 
points of light was the galaxy of 
the Milky Way and he was floating 
on his back on a flooding rock-pool 
of liquid metal under the stillness 
of an alien night. 

He switched on the suit’s radio 
beacon and, while he waited for the 
pinnace to arrive, looked about at 
the starry pointers of his new 
empire. And a woman’s sobbing 
heard from six hundred thousand 
parsecs reminded him that he was a 
creature with human weaknesses 
as well as special strengths. Some- 
how nothing was ever going to be 
quite the same again. ^

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Having read Miss Hilary fVit- 
kins letter'^ concerning The Moun- 
tain Movers in the October If I 
am obliged to admit that geology 
is a subject that I know little or 
nothing about. As a master mariner 
I am aware that rock is hard and 
it will put a hole in a ships side. 
All that is required of me is that 
I avoid rocks. 

In extenuation, however, I must 
say that the driver of the tourist 
coach in which I traveled to Ayers 
Rock — the remarkable granite 
monolith that gave me the inspira- 
tion for the story — told his passen- 
gers that it was an extrusion. He 
was not a geologist. None of us 
was a geologist. 

My own theory, advanced at the 
time, was that Ayers Rock was 
a huge meteorite that somehow 
had survived its passage through 
the atmosphere intact. This would 
account for its dissimilarity to 
Mount Connor, to the east, and to 
Mount Olga, to the west. 

Nobody took me seriously. I 



very much fear that Miss Wit kin 
wont, either.

Dear Editor: 

The October issue looked prom- 
ising enough at first glance — two 
long novelettes by Keith Laumer 
and Harry Harrison, two top-flight 
writers known for their ability to 
tell a good story, both examples 
of the kind of action-adventure 
type of story sf readers are always 
asking for, both presenting 
characters the authors have written 
about before. Both stories, un- 
fortunately, turned out to be 
disappointing. 

I have been reading Keith 
Laumer almost since he first began 
writing and have enjoyed most 
of his stories, including the many 
adventures of Retief However, 
enough is enough! The All- 
Together Planet was a bad novel. 



CORRECTION— In The Gods 
Themselves (jointly published 
by IF and GALAXY), the 
sentence beginning on the 12th 
line from the bottom, left col- 
umn, on page 20 of GALAXY 
March 1972, should have 
read: But with every atomic 
nucleus of plutonium- 1 86 sent 
to us, our Universe ends 
up with twenty fewer electrons.

I 





I still admire Laumer when he is 
at the top of his form as he was in 
the June issue when you published 
The Right To Revolt/The Right 
To Resist, but Retief has led a 
long and honorable life — cant 
he be retired? 

As for The Stainless Steel Rat 
Saves The World, it was a shoddy 
novel written at the bottom of 
Harrisons form and a complete 
bore from beginning to end. I have 
nothing against the well told action 
type of story, but feeble stories 
like this only hurt their author s 
reputations. I hope you are not try- 
ing to turn Slippery Jim deGriz 
into another series character along 
the lines of James Retief— if so, 
please forget them.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Although I have been an avid 
reader of science fiction for many 
years, my literary abilities incline 
me more toward poetry than the 
fictional art form. This being so, / 
will never be able to enter your 
forum as a writer but, as a poet, / 
would like to venture my opinion, 
in all modesty, of what the condi- 
tion of the planet earth will be by 
the year 2000. 

Isnt it about time we all 
realized that the planet earth in 
the year 2000 will be exactly what 



we, as Men, made it — or failed 
to make it? 

The winds of our Beings flow 
once from womb to tomb, and we, 
as individuals and as a race of 
beings, have the opportunity to 
make our mark upon the All. No 
doubt there are other sentient 
races in the universe, and no 
doubt some of them blew them- 
selves to hell and some of them 
evolved the ethical systems to con- 
trol technology and are now ex- 
ploring the universe. 

Which will be the fate of the race 
of Men? / believe it could be 
summed up in one couplet: Al- 
ternatives . 

Forsake ego’s ugly guise; 

Or before the Infinite 
in ashes lie! 

Richard Palmer

Starting in the next issue of 
If will be a new two-part serial. 
The Book of Rack The Healer, by 
Zach Hughes, a strong newcomer 
to these pages. It deals with Earth’s 
tomorrows with powerful impact— 
and more than touches on poetry 
in both its prose and content.
