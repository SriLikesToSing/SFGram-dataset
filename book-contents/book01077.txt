WHAT KIND OF FICTION? 



VER read this one? 

“Lancelot Buckmeister 
climbed the long stairs to the obser- 
vation platform of the ancient, 
abandoned Empire State Building 
and scanned the skies. There it 
was! The faint glint of light that 
was far Alpha Centauri, where hu- 
manity’s last surviving hope swung 
in orbit around a strange new star.” 
We did, but we sent it back to 
the writer with a polite note that 
said, “If Lancelot wanted a closer 
look at Alpha Centauri, he would 
have done better to climb the long 
stairs down to the ancient, aban- 
doned 34th Street Station of the 
BMT. He would have had to look 
directly through a few thousand 
miles of Earth in any case. Centau- 
rus is a southern constellation.” 
Plowing as we do through some 
millions of words each year to find 
the right number of serials, novel- 
las, novelets and shorts to fill 
GALAXY, we hit this sort of thing 
with distressing frequency. It isn’t 
always as bad as this. Sometimes 
(all too often!) it is far worse. 
Why? What keeps writers, espe- 

6 



cially new writers, from doing 
enough reading in the subjects they 
are writing about to avoid blund- 
ers? 

Nothing. And yet— the incoming 
manuscript heap is constantly hip- 
high with rockets that won’t move 
once they are out in space (because 
there’s no air for them to push a- 
gainst), bombs “dropped” from 
satellites (why not “drop” a bomb 
from Mars?), and so — endlessly — 
on. 

That’s an editor’s job, of course, 
and we do our best. But there’s 
another problem where the editor 
can’t help much — a much worse 
problem in terms of the eternal 
struggle to find enough first-class 
stories. 

That problem is the aridity of 
ideas. 

Here, more than anywhere else, 
is where writers must learn to do 
their homework. There are stories 
to be written that cannot be con- 
jured up out of last decade’s text- 
books, stories that come out of 
today’s latest fruits from the lab- 
oratories and the institutes. 

GALAXY 




TA OZENS of magazines and 
technical journals keep us 
up to date on what is new in mod- 
ern science, invention and tech- 
nology. What is new is a very great 
deal. Take only one magazine — 
the current issue of Industrial Re- 
search, say — and thumb through it. 
Page 12 tells about the astonish- 
ing new “aqua-therm” — a “pipeless 
pipe” that conducts water through 
water in a way, and with a preci- 
sion, that must be seen to be be- 
lieved. It melts ice, it keeps fish 
alive, it helps unbury buried trea- 
sure at the bottom of the sea. Is 
there a story there? Probably a 
dozen of them — ranging from an 
ice-free Arctic to, perhaps, a whole 
new concept of underwater farm- 
ing. 

Page 28 opens up a new world 
of lighting based on the phenome- 
non of electroluminescence, includ- 
ing such attractive notions as “see- 
through” windows that emit light 
on both sides without obstructing 
vision. 

Page 84 designs half a dozen 
new spacecraft for us, licking the 
acute problems involved in getting 
rid of the heat of re-entry by such 
diverse schemes as shedding hot 
sparks, “sweating,” “heat-sinks” and, 
most provocative of all, the mag- 
neto-hydrodynamic screen which 
keeps ship and air from contact in 
the first place. It tells us that “man 
will orbit the Earth by the end of 
1959” (did he? It may be happen- 
WHAT KIND OF FICTION 



ing while this issue is on the press! ) 
And it completes the schedule of 
conquering space as follows: “Land 
on the Moon by 1965; be on Mars 
and Venus three years later; and 
travel almost as fast as light, that 
is, 670 million mph, within 40 
years.” 

That is — Alpha Centauri before 
we are out of the 20th century. 

Maybe Lancelot Buckmeister 
will have something to look for 
after all! 

That’s only one issue of one 
magazine, and only the barest quick 
scanning of its contents. There 
must be many stories here; there’s 
no way of telling, given fertile im- 
agination and writing skill, what 
line on what page might produce 
a great new story. But the pity is 
that the stories won’t write them- 
selves. 

With about one technical gradu- 
ate in four going into research, with 
the nation’s Research 8s Develop- 
ment spending running to hundreds 
of millions of dollars a month, the 
laboratories are turning out mate- 
rial enough for all our plot-provok- 
ing needs. And science-fiction writ- 
ers are the logical pipeline between 
the scientists and the public, as far 
as the interpretation (not the mere 
reporting) of new ideas is con- 
cerned. It is the imagination in 
depth of a first-rate science fiction 
writer that can flesh out a dry tech- 
nical report and show us in human

Meeting of the Minds 



By ROBERT SHECKLEY 




What mission had the Quedak been given? 
Even he couldn't remember any more— but 
he refused to die till it was completed! 



Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



PART ONE 

T HE Quedak lay on a small 
hilltop and watched a slen- 
der jet of light descend 
through the sky. The feather-tailed 
jet was golden, and brighter than 



the sun. Poised above it was a glis- 
tening metallic object, fabricated 
rather than natural, hauntingly 
familiar. The Quedak tried to 
think what it was. 

He couldn’t remember. His 
memories had atrophied with his 



GALAXY MEETING OF THE MINDS

functions, leaving only scattered 
fragments of images. He searched 
among them now, leafing through 
his brief scraps of ruined cities, 
dying populations, a blue-water- 
filled canal, two moons, a space- 
ship . 

That was it. The descending ob- 
ject was a spaceship. There had 
been many of them during the 
great days of the Quedak. 

Those great days were over, 
buried forever beneath the pow- 
dery sands. Only the Quedak re- 
mained. He had life and he had a 
mission to perform. The driving 
urgency of his mission remained, 
even after memory and function 
had failed. 

As the Quedak watched, the 
spaceship dipped lower. It wob- 
bled and side jets kicked out to 
straighten it. With a gentle explo- 
sion of dust, the spaceship settled 
tail first on the arid plain. 

And the Quedak, driven by the 
imperative Quedak mission, 
dragged itself painfully down from 
the little hilltop. Every movement 
was an agony. If he were a selfish 
creature, the Quedak would have 
died. But he was not selfish. Que- 
daks owed a duty to the universe; 
and that spaceship, after all the 
blank years, was a link to other 
worlds, to planets where the Que- 
dak could live again and give his 
services to the native fauna. 

He crawled, a centimeter at a 
time, and wondered whether he 

10 



had the strength to reach the alien 
spaceship before it left this dusty, 
dead planet. 



APT AIN JENSEN of the 
spaceship Southern Cross was 
bored sick with Mars. He and his 
men had been here for ten days. 
They had found no important ar- 
cheological specimens, no tantaliz- 
ing hints of ancient cities such as 
the Polaris expedition had discov- 
ered at the South Pole. Here there 
was nothing but sand, a few weary 
shrubs, and a rolling hill or two. 
Their biggest find so far had been 
three pottery shards. 

Jensen readjusted his oxygen 
booster. Over the rise of a hill he 
saw his two men returning. 

“Anything interesting?” he 
asked. 

“Just this,” said engineer Vayne, 
holding up an inch of corroded 
blade without a handle. 

“Better than nothing,” Jensen 
said. “How about you, Wilks?” 

The navigator shrugged his 
shoulders. “Just photographs of the 
landscape.” 

“OK,” Jensen said. “Dump 
everything into the sterilizer and 
let’s get going.” 

Wilks looked mournful. “Cap- 
tain, one quick sweep to the north 
might turn up something really—” 

“Not a chance,” Jensen said. 
“Fuel, food, water, everything was 
calculated for a ten-day stay. That’s 
three days longer than Polaris had. 



GALAXY 



We’re taking off this evening.” 

The men nodded. They had no 
reason to complain. As the second 
to land on Mars, they were sure 
of a small but respectable footnote 
in the history books. They put 
their equipment through the ster- 
ilizer vent, sealed it, and climbed 
the ladder to the lock. Once they 
were inside, Vayne closed and 
dogged the hatch, and started to 
open the inside pressure door. 
“Hold it!” Jensen called out. 
“What’s the matter?” 

“I thought I saw something on 
your boot,” Jensen said. “Some- 
thing like a big bug.” 

Vayne quickly ran his hands 
down the sides of his boots. The 
two men circled him, examining 
his clothing. 

“Shut that inner door,” the cap- 
tain said. ‘Wilks, did you see 
anything?” 

“Not a thing,” the navigator said. 
“Are you sure, Cap? We haven’t 
found anything that looks like ani- 
mal or insect life here. Only a few 
plants.” 

“I could have sworn I saw some- 
thing,” Jensen said. “Maybe I was 
wrong . Anyhow, we’ll fumigate 
our clothes before we enter the 
ship proper. No sense taking any 
chance of bringing back some kind 
of Martian bug.” 

The men removed their clothing 
and boots and stuffed them into 
the chute. They searched the bare 
steel room carefully. 

MEETING OF THE MINDS 



“Nothing here,” Jensen said at 
last. “OK, let’s go inside.” 

Once inside the ship, they sealed 
off the lock and fumigated it. The 
Quedak, who had crept inside ear- 
lier through the partially opened 
pressure door, listened to the dis- 
tant hiss of gas. After a while he 
heard the jets begin to fire. 

The Quedak retreated to the 
dark rear of the ship. He found a 
metal shelf and attached himself to 
the underside of it near the wall. 
After a while he felt the ship 
tremble. 

THE QUEDAK clung to the shelf 
during the long, slow flight through 
space. He had forgotten what 
spaceships were like, but now mem- 
ory revived briefly. He felt blazing 
heat and freezing cold. Adjusting 
to the temperature changes drained 
his small store of vitality, and the 
Quedak began to wonder if he was 
going to die. 

He refused to die. Not while 
there was still a possibility of ac- 
complishing the Quedak mission. 

In time he felt the harsh pull of 
gravity, and felt the main jets fir- 
ing again. The ship was coming 
down to its planet. 

A FTER a routine landing, Cap- 
tain Jensen and his men were 
taken to Medic Checkpoint, where 
they were thumped, probed and 
tested for any sign of disease. 

Their spaceship was lowered to 

11 



a flatcar and taken past rows of 
moonships and ICBMs to Decon- 
tamination Stage One. Here the 
sealed outer hull was washed down 
with powerful cleansing sprays. By 
evening, the ship was taken to De- 
contamination Stage Two. 

A team of two inspectors 
equipped with bulky tanks and 
hoses undogged the hatch and en- 
tered, shutting the hatch behind 
them. 

They began at the bow, metho- 
dically spraying as they moved 
toward the rear. Everything 
seemed in order; no animals or 
plants, no trace of mold such as the 
first Luna expedition had brought 
back. 

“Do you really think this is nec- 
essary?” the assistant inspector 
asked. He had already requested 
a transfer to Flight Control. 

“Sure it is,” the senior inspector 
said. “Can’t tell what these ships 
might bring in.” 

“I suppose so,” the assistant said. 
“Still, a Martian whoosis wouldn’t 
even be able to live on Earth. 
Would it?” 

“How should I know?” the sen- 
ior inspector said. “I’m no botan- 
ist. Maybe they don’t know, either.” 

“Seems like a waste of — hey!” 

“What is it?” the senior inspec- 
tor asked. 

“I thought I saw something,” the 
assistant said. “Looked a little like 
a palmetto bug. Over by that shelf.” 

The senior inspector adjusted 



his respirator more snugly over his 
face and motioned to his assistant 
to do the same. He advanced slow- 
ly toward the shelf, unfastening a 
second nozzle from the pressure 
tank on his back. He turned it on, 
and a cloud of greenish gas sprayed 
out. 

“There,” the senior inspector 
said. “That should take care of your 
bug.” He knelt down and looked 
under the shelf. “Nothing here.” 

“It was probably a shadow,” the 
assistant said. 

Together they sprayed the entire 
interior of the ship, paying particu 7 
lar attention to the small box of 
Martian artifacts. They left the 
gas-filled ship and dogged the hatch 
again. 

“Now what?” the assistant asked. 

“Now we leave the ship sealed 
for three days,” the senior inspec- 
tor said. “Then we inspect again. 
You find me the animal that’ll live 
through that.” 

T I 1 HE Quedak, who had been 
clinging to the underside of the 
assistant’s shoe between the heel 
and the sole, released his hold. He 
watched the shadowy biped figures 
move away, talking in their deep, 
rumbling, indecipherable voices. 
He felt tired and unutterably 
lonely. 

But buoying him up was the 
thought of the Quedak mission. 
Only that was important. The first 
part of the mission was accom- 



12 



GALAXY 



plished. He had landed safely on 
an inhabited planet. Now he need- 
ed food and drink. Then he had 
to have rest, a great deal of rest 
to restore his dormant faculties. 
After that he would be ready to 
give this world what it so obviously 
needed — the cooperation possible 
only through the Quedak mind. 

He crept slowly down the shad- 
owy yard, past the deserted hulls 
of spaceships. He came to a wire 
fence and sensed the high-voltage 
electricity running through it. 
Gauging his distance carefully, the 
Quedak jumped safely through one 
of the openings in the mesh. 

This was a very different section. 
From here the Quedak could smell 
water and food. He moved hastily 
forward, then stopped. 

He sensed the presence of a man. 
And something else. Something 
much more menacing. 

“WHO’S THERE?” the watchman 
called out. He waited, his revolver 
in one hand, his flashlight in the 
other. Thieves had broken into the 
yards last week; they had stolen 
three cases of computer parts 
bound for Rio. Tonight he was 
ready for them. 

He walked forward, an old, keen- 
eyed man holding his revolver in 
a rock-steady fist. The beam of his 
flashlight probed among the car- 
goes. The yellow light flickered 
along a great pile of precision ma- 
chine tools for South Africa, past a 

MEETING OF THE MINDS 



water-extraction plant for Jordan 
and a pile of mixed goods for 
Rabaul. 

“You better come out,” the 
watchman shouted. His flashlight 
probed at sacks of rice for. Shang- 
hai and power saws for Burma. 
Then the beam of light stopped 
abruptly. 

“I’ll be damned,” the watchman 
said. Then he laughed. A huge and 
red-eyed rat was glaring into the 
beam of his flashlight. It had some- 
thing in its jaws, something that 
looked like an unusually large 
cockroach. 

“Good eating,” the watchman 
said. He holstered his revolver and 
continued his patrol. 

A large black animal had seized 
the Quedak, and he felt heavy 
jaws close over his back. He tried 
to fight; but, blinded by a sudden 
beam of yellow light, he was be- 
trayed by total and enervating con- 
fusion. 

The yellow light went off. The 
black beast bit down hard on the 
Quedak’s armored back. The Que- 
dak mustered his remaining 
strength, and, uncoiling his long, 
scorpion-jointed tail, lashed out. 

He missed, but the black beast 
released him hastily. They circled 
each other, the Quedak hoisting his 
tail for a second blow, the beast un- 
willing to turn loose this prey. 

The Quedak waited for his 
chance. Elation filled him. This 



13 



pugnacious animal could be the 
first, the first on this planet to ex- 
perience the Quedak mission. 
From this humble creature a start 
could be made. 

The beast sprang and its white 
teeth clicked together viciously. 
The Quedak moved out of the way 
and its barb-headed tail flashed 
out, fastening itself in the beast’s 
back. The Quedak held on grimly 
while the beast leaped and squirm- 
ed. Setting his feet, the Quedak 
concentrated on the all-important 
task of pumping a tiny white crys- 
tal down the length of his tail and 
under the beast’s skin. 

But this most important of the 
Quedak faculties was still dormant 
Unable to accomplish anything, the 
Quedak released his barbs, and, 
taking careful aim, accurately 
drove his sting home between the 
black beast’s eyes. The blow, as the 
Quedak had known, was lethal. 

The Quedak took nourishment 
from the body of its dead foe; re- 
gretfully, for by inclination the 
Quedak was herbivorous. When he 
had finished, the Quedak knew that 
he was in desperate need of a long 
period of rest. Only after that could 
the full Quedak powers be re- 
gained. 

He crawled up and down the 
piles of goods in the yard, looking 
for a place to hide. Carefully he 
examined several bales. At last he 
reached a stack of heavy boxes. 
One of the boxes had a crack just 



large enough to admit him. 

The Quedak crawled inside, 
down the shiny, oil-slick surface of 
a machine, to die far end of the 
box. There he went into the dream- 
less, defenseless sleep of the Que- 
dak, serenely trusting in what the 
future would bring. 

PART TWO 
I 

r I ^ HE big gaff-headed schooner 
was pointed directly at the reef- 
enclosed island, moving toward it 
with the solidity of an express train. 
The sails billowed under powerful 
gusts of the northwest breeze, and 
the rusty Allison-Chambers diesel 
rumbled beneath a teak grating. 
The skipper and mate stood on the 
bridge deck and watched the reef 
approach. 

“Anything yet?” the skipper 
asked. He was a stocky, balding 
man with a perpetual frown on his 
face. He had been sailing his 
schooner among the uncharted 
shoals and reefs of the Southwest 
Pacific for twenty-five years. He 
frowned because his old ship was 
not insurable. His deck cargo, how- 
ever, was insured. Some of it had 
come all the way from Ogdensville, 
that transshipment center in the 
desert where spaceships landed. 

“Not a thing,” the mate said. He 
was watching the dazzling white 
wall of coral, looking for the gleam 



14 



GALAXY 



of blue that would reveal the nar- 
row pass to the inner lagoon. This 
was his first trip to the Solomon 
Islands. A former television repair- 
man in Sydney before he got the 
wanderlust, the mate wondered if 
the skipper had gone crazy and 
planned a spectacular suicide 
against the reef. 

“Still nothing!” he shouted. 
“Shoals ahead!” 

“I’ll take it,” the skipper said to 
the helmsman. He gripped the 
wheel and watched the unbroken 
face on the reef. 

“Nothing,” the mate said. “Skip- 
per, we’d better come about.” 

“Not if we’re going to get through 
the pass,” the skipper said. He was 
beginning to get worried. But he 
had promised to deliver goods to 
the American treasure-hunters on 
this island, and the skipper’s word 
was his bond. He had picked up the 
cargo in Rabaul and made his usual 
stops at the settlements on New 
Georgia and Malaita. When he fin- 
ished here, he could look forward 
to a thousand-mile run to New 
Caledonia. 

“There it is!” the mate shouted. 

A thin slit of blue had appeared 
in the coral wall. They were less 
than thirty yards from it now, and 
the old schooner was making close 
to eight knots. 

A S the ship entered the pass, the 
skipper threw the wheel hard 
over. The schooner spun on its keel. 



Coral flashed by on either side, 
close enough to touch. There was 
a metallic shriek as an upper main- 
mast spreader snagged and came 
free. Then they were in the pass, 
bucking a six-knot current. 

The mate pushed the diesel to 
full throttle, then sprang back to 
help the skipper wrestle with the 
wheel. Under sail and power the 
schooner forged through the pass, 
scraped by an outcropping to port, 
and came onto the placid surface of 
the lagoon. 

The skipper mopped his fore- 
head with a large blue bandanna. 
“Very snug work,” he said. 

“Snug!” the mate cried. He 
turned away, and the skipper 
smiled a brief smile. 

They slid past a small ketch rid- 
ing at anchor. The native hands 
took down sail and the schooner 
nosed up to a rickety pier that 
jutted out from the beach. Lines 
were made fast to palm trees. From 
the fringe of jungle above the beach 
a white man came down, walking 
briskly in the noonday heat. 

He was very tall and thin, with 
knobby knees and elbows. The 
fierce Melanesian sun had burned 
out but not tanned him, and his 
nose and cheekbones were peeling. 
His horn-rimmed glasses had brok- 
en at the hinge and been repaired 
with a piece of tape. He looked 
eager, boyish, and curiously naive. 

One hell-of-a-looking treasure- 
hunter, the mate thought. 



MEETING OF THE MINDS

“Glad to see you!” the man called 
out. “We’d about given you up for 
lost.” 

“Not likely,” the skipper said. 
“Mr. Sorensen, I’d like you to meet 
my new mate, Mr. Willis.” 

“Glad to meet you, Professor,” 
the mate said. 

“I’m not a professor,” Sorensen 
said, “but thanks anyhow.” 

‘Where are the others?” the 
skipper asked. 

“Out in the jungle,” Sorensen 
said. “All except Drake, and he’ll 
be down here shortly. You’ll stay a 
while, won’t you?” 

“Only to unload,” the skipper 
said. “Have to catch the tide out of 
here. How’s the treasure-hunting?” 
“We’ve done a lot of digging,” 
Sorensen said. “We still have our 
hopes.” 

“But no doubloons yet?” the 
skipper asked. “No pieces of eight?” 
“Not a damned one,” Sorensen 
said wearily. “Did you bring the 
newspapers, Skipper?” 

“That I did,” Sorenson replied. 
“They’re in the cabin. Did you hear 
about that second spaceship going 
to Mars?” 

“Heard about it on the short 
wave,” Sorensen said. “It didn’t 
bring back much, did it?” 

“Practically nothing. Still, just 
think of it. T wo spaceships to Mars, 
and I hear they’re getting ready to 
put one on Venus.” 

The three men looked around 
them and grinned. 



Well,” the skipper said, “I guess 
maybe the space age hasn’t reach- 
ed the Southwest Pacific yet. And 
it certainly hasn’t gotten to this 
place. Come on, let’s unload the 
cargo.” 

HIS place was the island of 

Vuanu, southernmost of the 
Solomons, almost in the Louisade 
Archipelago. It was a fair-sized vol- 
canic island, almost twenty miles 
long and several wide. Once it had 
supported half a dozen native vil- 
lages. But the population had be- 
gun to decline after the depreda- 
tions of the blackbirders in the 
1850s. Then a measles epidemic 
wiped out almost all the rest, and 
the survivors emigrated to New 
Georia. A ship-watcher had been 
stationed here during the Second 
World War, but no ships had come 
this way. The Japanese invasion 
had poured across New Guinea and 
the upper Solomons, and further 
north through Micronesia. At the 
end of the war Vuanu was still de- 
serted. It was not made into a bird 
sanctuary like Canton Island, or a 
cable station like Christmas Island, 
or a refueling point like Cocos- 
Keeling. No one even wanted to 
explode alphabet bombs on it. 
Vuanu was a worthless, humid, 
jungle-covered piece of land, free 
to anyone who wanted it. 

William Sorensen, general man- 
ager of a chain of liquor stores in 
California, decided he wanted it. 



16 



GALAXY 



Sorensen’s hobby was treasure- 
hunting. He had looked for Lafitte’s 
treasure in Louisiana and Texas, 
and for the Lost Dutchman Mine 
in Arizona. He had found neither. 
His luck had been better on the 
wreck-strewn Gulf coast, and on an 
expedition to Dagger Cay in the 
Caribbean he had found a double 
handful of Spanish coins in a rot- 
ting canvas bag. The coins were 
worth about three thousands dol- 
lars. The expedition had cost very 
much more, but Sorensen felt amp- 
ly repaid. 

For many years he had been in- 
terested in the Spanish treasure 
galleon Santa Teresa. Contempor- 
ary accounts told how the ship, 
heavily laden with bullion, sailed 
from Manila in 1689. The clumsy 
ship, caught in a storm, had run 
off to the south and been wrecked. 
Eighteen survivors managed to get 
ashore with the treasure. They 
buried it, and set sail for the Phil- 
lipines in the ship’s pinnacle. Two 
of them were alive when the boat 
reached Manila. 

The treasure island was tenta- 
tively identified as one of the Solo- 
mons. But which one? 

No one knew. Treasure-hunters 
looked for the cache on Bougain- 
ville and Buka. There was a rumor 
about it on Malaita, and even On- 
tong Java received an expedition. 
But no treasure was recovered. 

Sorensen, researching the prob- 
lem thoroughly, decided that the 



Santa Teresa had sailed complete- 
ly through the Solomons, almost to 
the Louisades. The ship must have 
escaped destruction until it crashed 
into the reef at Vuanu. 

His desire to search for the 
treasure might have remained only 
a dream if he hadn’t met Dan 
Drake. Drake was also an amateur 
treasure-hunter. More important, 
he owned a fifty-five-foot Hanna 
ketch. 

Over an evening’s drinks the 
Vuanu expedition was born. 

Additional members were re- 
cruited. Drake’s ketch was put into 
seagoing condition, equipment and 
money saved or gathered. Several 
other possible treasure sites in the 
Southwest Pacific were researched. 
Finally, vacation time was syn- 
chronized and the expedition got 
under way. 

They had put in three months’ 
work on Vuanu already. Their 
morale was high, in spite of inevit- 
able conflicts between members. 
This schooner, bringing in supplies 
from Sydney and Rabaul, was the 
last civilized contact they would 
have for another six months. 

YY7HILE Sorensen nervously su- 
'' pervised, the crew of the 
schooner unloaded the cargo. He 
didn’t want any of the equipment, 
some of it shipped over six thou- 
sand miles, to be broken now. No 
replacements were possible; what- 
ever they didn’t have, they would 



MEETING OF THE MINDS

have to do without. He breathed 
out in relief when the last crate, 
containing a metals detector, was 
safely hoisted over the side and 
put on the beach above the high- 
water mark. 

There was something odd about 
that box. He examined it and 
found a quarter-sized hole in one 
end. It had not been properly 
sealed. 

Dan Drake, the co-manager of 
the expedition, joined him. “Whaf s 
wrong?” Drake asked. 

“Hole in that crate,” Sorensen 
said. “Salt water might have gotten 
in. We’ll be in tough shape if this 
detector doesn’t work.” 

Drake nodded. “We better open 
it and see.” He was a short, deeply 
tanned, broad-chested man with 
close-cropped black hair and a 
straggly mustache. He wore an old 
yachting cap jammed down over 
his eyes, giving his face a tough 
bulldog look. He pulled a big screw- 
driver from his belt and inserted 
it into the crack. 

“Wait a moment,” Sorensen said. 
“Let’s get it up to the camp first. 
Easier to carry the crate than 
something packed in grease.” 

“Right,” Drake said. “Take the 
other end.” 

The camp was built in a clearing 
a hundred yards from the beach, 
on the site of an abandoned native 
village. They had been able to re- 
thatch several huts, and there was 
an old copra shed with a galva- 



nized iron roof where they stored 
their supplies. Here they got the 
benefit of any breeze from the sea. 
Beyond the clearing, the gray- 
green jungle sprang up like a solid 
wall. 

Sorensen and Drake set the case 
down. The skipper, who had ac- 
companied them with the news- 
papers, looked around at the bleak 
huts and shook his head. 

“Would you like a drink, Skip- 
per?” Sorensen asked. “Afraid we 
can’t offer any ice.” 

“A drink would be fine,” the 
skipper said. He wondered what 
drove men to a godforsaken place 
like this in search of imaginary 
Spanish treasure. 

Sorensen went into one of the 
huts and brought out a bottle of 
Scotch and a tin cup. Drake had 
taken out his screwdriver and was 
vigorously ripping boards off the 
crate. 

“How does it look?” Sorensen 
asked. 

“It’s OK,” Drake said, gently 
lifting out the metals detector. 
“Heavily greased. Doesn’t seem 
like there was any damage — ” 

He jumped back. The skipper 
had come forward and stamped 
down heavily on the sand. 

“What’s the matter?” Sorensen 
asked. 

“Looked like a scorpion,” the 
skipper said. “Damned thing 
crawled right out of your crate 
there. Might have bit you.” 



18 



GALAXY 



S ORENSEN shrugged. He had 
gotten used to the presence of 
an infinite number of insects dur- 
ing his three months on Vuanu. 
Another bug more or less didn’t 
seem to make much difference. 
“Another drink?” he asked. 
“Can’t do it,” the skipper said 
regretfully. “I’d better get started. 
All your party healthy?” 

“All healthy so far,” Sorensen 
said. He smiled. “Except for some 
bad cases of gold fever.” 

“You’ll never find gold in this 
place,” the skipper said seriously. 
“I’ll look in on you in about six 
months. Good luck.” 

After shaking hands, the skip- 
per went down to the beach and 
boarded his ship. As the first pink 
flush of sunset touched the sky, the 
schooner was under way. Sorensen 
and Drake watched it negotiate the 
pass. For a few minutes its masts 
were visible above the reef. Then 
they had dipped below the horizon. 

“That’s that,” Drake said. “Us 
crazy American treasure-hunters 
are alone again.” 

“You don’t think he suspected 
anything?” Sorensen asked. 

“Definitely not. As far as he’s 
concerned, we’re just crackpots.” 
Grinning, they looked back at 
their camp. Under the copra shed 
was nearly fifty thousand dollars 
worth of gold and silver bullion, 
dug out of the jungle and carefully 
reburied. They had located a part 
of the Santa Teresa treasure dur- 



ing their first month on the island. 
There was every indication of 
more to come. Since they had no 
legal title to the land, the expedi- 
tion was not eager to let the news 
get out. Once it was known, every 
gold-hungry vagabond from Perth 
to Papeete would be heading to 
Vuanu. 

“The boy’ll be in soon,” Drake 
said. “Let’s get some stew going.” 
“Right,” Sorensen said. He took 
a few steps and stopped. “That’s 
funny.” 

“What is?” 

“That scorpion the skipper 
squashed. It’s gone.” 

“Maybe he missed it,” Drake 
said. “Or maybe he just pushed it 
down into the sand. What differ- 
ence does it make?” 

“None, I guess,” Sorensen said. 

II 

TJ DWARD EAKINS walked 
through the jungle with a long- 
handled spade on his shoulder, 
sucking reflectively on a piece of 
candy. It was the first he’d had in 
weeks, and he was enjoying it to 
the utmost. He was in very good 
spirits. The schooner yesterday 
had brought in not only machinery 
and replacement parts, but also 
candy, cigarettes and food. He had 
eaten scrambled eggs this morning, 
and real bacon. The expedition was 
becoming almost civilized. 

Something rustled in the bushes 



MEETING OF THE MINDS 



19 



near him. He marched on, ignoring 
it. 

He was a lean, sandy-haired man, 
amiable and slouching, with pale 
blue eyes and an unprepossessing 
manner. He felt very lucky to have 
been taken on the expedition. His 
gas station didn’t put him on a 
financial par with the others, and 
he hadn’t been able to put up a full 
share of the money. He still felt 
guilty about that. He had been ac- 
cepted because he was an eager 
and indefatigable treasure-hunter 
with a good knowledge of jungle 
ways. Equally important, he was a 
skilled radio operator and repair- 
man. He had kept the transmitter 
on the ketch in working condition 
in spite of salt water and mildew. 

He could pay his full share now, 
of course. But now, when they were 
practically rich, didn’t really count. 
He wished there were some way he 
could — 

There was that rustle in the 
bushes again. 

Eakins stopped and waited. The 
bushes trembled. And out stepped 
a mouse. 

Eakins was amazed. The mice 
on this island, like most wild ani- 
mal life, were terrified of man. Al- 
though they feasted off the refuse 
of the camp - when the rats didn’t 
get it first — they carefully avoided 
any contact with humans. 

“You better get yourself home,” 
Eakins said to the mouse. 

The mouse stared at him. He 



stared back. It was a pretty little 
mouse, no more than four or five 
inches long, and colored a light 
tawny brown. It didn’t seem afraid. 

“So long, mouse,” Eakins said. “I 
got work to do.” He shifted his 
spade to the other shoulder and 
turned to go. As he turned, he 
caught a flash of brown out of the 
corner of his eye. Instinctively he 
ducked. The mouse whirled past 
him, turned, and gathered itself for 
another leap. 

“Mouse, are you out of your 
head?” Eakins asked. 

The mouse bared its tiny teeth 
and sprang. Eakins knocked it 
aside. 

“Now get the hell out of here,” 
he said. He was beginning to wond- 
er if the rodent was crazy. Did it 
have rabies, perhaps? 

The mouse gathered itself for 
another charge. Eakins lifted the 
spade off his shoulders and waited. 
When the mouse sprang, he met it 
with a carefully timed blow. Then 
carefully, regretfully, he battered 
it to death. 

“Can’t have rabid mice running 
around,” he said. 

But the mouse hadn’t seemed 
rabid; it had just seemed very de- 
termined. 

Eakins scratched his head. Now 
what, he wondered, had gotten into 
that little mouse? 

In the camp that evening, 
Eakins’ story was greeted with 
hoots of laughter. It was just like 



20 



GALAXY 



Eakins to be attacked by a mouse. 
Several men suggested that he go 
armed in case the mouse’s family 
wanted revenge. Eakins just smiled 
sheepishly. 

T WO days later, Sorensen and 
A1 Cable were finishing up a 
morning’s hard work at Site 4, two 
miles from the camp. The metals 
detector had shown marked activ- 
ity at this spot. They were seven 
feet down and nothing had been 
produced yet except a high mound 
of yellow-brown earth. 

“That detector must be wrong,” 
Cable said, wiping his face wearily. 
He was a big, pinkish man. He had 
sweated off twenty pounds on 
Vuanu, picked up a bad case of 
prickly heat, and had enough treas- 
ure-hunting to last him a lifetime. 
He wished he were back in Balti- 
more taking care of his used-car 
agency. He didn’t hesitate to say 
so, often and loudly. He was one 
member who had not worked out 
well. 

“Nothing wrong with the detec- 
tor,” Sorensen said. “Trouble is, 
we’re digging in swampy ground. 
The cache must have sunk.” 

“It’s probably a hundred feet 
down,” Cable said, stabbing angrily 
at the gluey mud. 

“Nope,” Sorensen said. "There’s 
volcanic rock under us, no more 
than twenty feet down.” 

“Twenty feet? We should have a 
bulldozer.” 



“Might be costly bringing one 
in,” Sorensen said mildly. “Come 
on, Al, let’s get back to camp.” 
Sorensen helped Cable out of 
the excavation. They cleaned off 
their tools and started toward the 
narrow path leading back to the 
camp. They stopped abruptly. 

A large, ugly bird had stepped 
out of the brush. It was standing on 
the path, blocking their way. 

“What in hell is that?” Cable 
asked. 

“A cassowary,” Sorensen said. 
“Well, let’s boot it out of the way 
and get going.” 

“Take it easy,” Sorensen said. 
“If anyone does any booting, it’ll 
be the bird. Back away slowly.” 
The cassowary was nearly five 
feet high, a black-feathered ostrich- 
like bird standing erect on power- 
ful legs. Each of its feet was three- 
toed, and the toes curved into 
heavy talons. It had a yellowish, 
bony head and short, useless wings. 
From its neck hung a brilliant wat- 
tle colored red, green, and purple. 
“It is dangerous?” Cable asked. 
Sorensen nodded. “Natives on 
New Guinea have been kicked to 
death by those birds.” 

“Why haven’t we seen it be- 
fore?” Cable asked. 

“They’re usually very shy,” Sor- 
ensen said. “They stay as far from 
people as they can.” 

“This one sure isn’t shy,” Cable 
said, as the cassowary took a step 
toward them. “Can we run?” 



MEETING OF THE MINDS 



21 



“The bird can run a lot faster,” 
Sorensen said. “I don’t suppose you 
have a gun with you?” 

“Of course not. There’s been 
nothing to shoot.” 

TRACKING away, they held 
their spades like spears. The 
brush crackled and an anteater 
emerged. It was followed by a wild 
pig. The three beasts converged on 
the men, backing them toward the 
dense wall of the jungle. 

“They’re herding us,” Cable said, 
his voice going shrill. 

“Take it easy,” Sorensen said. 
“The cassowary is the only one we 
have to watch out for.” 

“Aren’t anteaters dangerous?” 

“Only to ants.” 

“The hell you say,” Cable said. 
“Bill, the animals on this island 
have gone crazy. Remember Ea- 
kins’ mouse?” 

“I remember it,” Sorensen said. 
They had reached the far edge of 
the clearing. The beasts were in 
front of them, still advancing, with 
the cassowary in the center. Behind 
them lay the jungle — and what- 
ever they were being herded 
toward. 

“We’ll have to make a break for 
it,” Sorensen said. 

“That damned bird is blocking 
the trail.” 

“We’ll have to knock him over,” 
Sorensen said. ‘Watch out for his 
feet. Let’s go!” 

They raced toward the casso- 



wary, swinging their spades. The 
cassowary hesitated, unable to 
make up its mind between targets. 
Then it turned toward Cable and 
its right leg lashed out. The partial- 
ly deflected blow sounded like the 
flat of a meat cleaver against a 
side of beef. Cable grunted and col- 
lapsed, clutching his ribs. 

Sorensen stabbed, and the honed 
edge of his spade nearly severed 
the cassowary’s head from its body. 
The wild pig and the anteater were 
coming at him now. He flailed with 
his spade, driving them back. Then, 
with a strength he hadn’t known he 
possessed, he stooped, lifted Cable 
across his shoulders and ran down 
the path. 

A quarter of a mile down he had 
to stop, completely out of breath. 
There were no sounds behind him. 
The other animals were apparent- 
ly not following. He went back to 
the wounded man. 

Cable had begun to recover con- 
sciousness. He was able to walk, 
half-supported by Sorensen. When 
they reached the camp, Sorensen 
called everybody in for a meeting. 
He counted heads while Eakins 
taped up Cable’s side. Only one 
man was missing. 

“Where’s Drake?” Sorensen 
asked. 

“He’s across the island at North 
Beach, fishing,” said Tom Recetich. 
“Want me to get him?” 

Sorensen hesitated. Finally he 
said, “No. I’d better explain what 



22 



GALAXY 



we’re up against. Then we’ll issue 
the guns. Then we’ll try to find 
Drake.” 

“Man, what’s going on?” Re- 
cetich asked. 

Sorensen began to explain what 
had happened at Site 4. 

F ISHING provided an impor- 
tant part of the expedition’s 
food and there was no work Drake 
liked better. At first he had gone 
out with face mask and spear gun. 
But the sharks in this corner of 
the world were numerous, hungry 
and aggressive. So, regretfully, he 
had given up skin diving and set 
out handlines on the leeward side 
of the island. 

The lines were out now, and 
Drake lay in the shade of a palm 
tree, half asleep, his big forearms 
folded over his chest. His dog, Oro, 
was prowling the beach in search 
of hermit crabs. Oro was a good- 
natured mutt, part airdale, part 
terrier, part unknown. He was 
growling at something now. 

“Leave the crabs alone,” Drake 
called out. “You’ll just get nipped 
again.” 

Oro was still growling. Drake 
rolled over and saw that the dog 
was standing stiff-legged over a 
large insect. It looked like some 
kind of scorpion. 

“Oro, leave that blasted — ” 
Before Drake could move, the 
insect sprang. It landed on Oro’s 
neck and the jointed tail whipped 



out. Oro yelped once. Drake was 
on his feet instantly. He swatted 
at the bug, but it jumped off the 
dog’s neck and scuttled into the 
brush. 

“Take it easy, old boy,” Drake 
said. “That’s a nasty-looking 
wound. Might be poisoned. I better 
open it up.” 

He held the panting dog firmly 
and drew his boat knife. He had 
operated on the dog for snake bite 
in Central America, and in the 
Adirondacks he had held him down 
and pulled porcupine quills out of 
his mouth with a pair of pliers. The 
dog always knew he was being 
helped. He never struggled. 

This time, the dog bit. 

“Oro!” Drake grabbed the dog at 
the jaw hinge with his free hand. 
He brought pressure to bear, para- 
lyzing the muscles, forcing the dog’s 
jaws open. He pulled his hand out 
and flung the dog away. Oro rolled 
to his feet and advanced on him 
again. 

“Stand!” Drake shouted. The 
dog kept coming, edging around to 
get between the ocean and the 
man. 

Turning, Drake saw the bug 
emerge from the jungle and creep 
toward him. His dog had circled 
around and was trying to drive him 
toward the bug. 

Drake didn’t know what was 
going on, and he decided he’d 
better not stay to find out. He 
picked up his knife and threw it at 



MEETING OF THE MINDS 



23 



the bug. He missed. The bug was 
almost within jumping distance. 

Drake ran toward the ocean. 
When Oro tried to intercept him, 
he kicked the dog out of the way 
and plunged into the water. 

He began to swim around the 
island to the camp, hoping he’d 
make /It before the sharks got him. 

Ill 

A T the camp, rifles and revolvers 
were hastily wiped clean of 
cosmoline and passed around. Bin- 
oculars were taken out and adjust- 
ed. Cartridges were divided up, 
and the supply of knives, machetes 
and hatchets quickly disappeared. 
The expedition’s two walkie-talk- 
ies were unpacked, and the men 
prepared to move out in search of 
Drake. Then they saw him, swim- 
ming vigorously around the edge 
of the island. 

He waded ashore, tired but un- 
injured. He and the others put 
their information together and 
reached some unhappy conclusions. 

“Do you mean to say,” Cable 
demanded, “that a bug is doing all 
this?” 

“It looks that way,” Sorensen 
said. “We have to assume that it’s 
able to exercise some kind of 
thought control. Maybe hypnotic 
or telepathic.” 

“It has to sting first,” Drake said. 
“That’s what it did with Oro.” 

“I just can’t imagine a scorpion 



doing all that,” Recetich said. 

“It’s not a scorpion,” Drake 
said. “I saw it close up. It’s got a 
tail like a scorpion, but its head is 
damn near four times as big, and 
its body is different. Up close, it 
doesn’t look like anything you ever 
saw before.” 

“Do you think it’s native to this 
island?” asked Monty Byrnes, a 
treasure-seeker from Indianapolis. 

“I doubt it,” Drake said. “If it is, 
why did it leave us and the animals 
alone for three months?” 

“That’s right,” Sorensen said. 
“All our troubles began just after 
the schooner came. The schooner 
must have brought it from some- 
where. Hey!” 

“What is it?” Drake asked. 
“Remember that scorpion the 
skipper tried to squash? It came 
out of the detector crate. Do you 
think it could be the same one?” 
Drake shrugged his shoulders. 
“Could be. Seems to me our prob- 
lem right now isn’t finding out 
where it came from. We have to 
figure out what to do about it.” 

“If it can control animals,” 
Byrnes said, “I wonder if it can con- 
trol men.” 

HEY were all silent. They had 
moved into a circle near the 
copra shed, and while they talked 
they watched the jungle for any 
sign of insect or animal life. 

Sorensen said, “We’d better 
radio for help.” 




24 



GALAXY 



“If we do that,” Recetich said, 
“somebody’s going to find out about 
the Santa Teresa treasure. We’ll 
be overrun in no time.” 

“Maybe so,” Sorensen said. “But 
at the worst, we’ve cleared ex- 
penses. We’ve even made a small 
profit.” 

“And if we don’t get help,” Drake 
said, “we may be in no condition 
to take anything out of here.” 
“The problem isn’t as bad as all 
that,” Byrnes said. “We’ve got guns. 
We can take care of the animals.” 
“You haven’t seen the bug yet,” 
Drake said. 

“We’ll squash it.” 

“That won’t be easy,” Drake 
said. “It’s faster than hell. And how 
are you going to squash it if it 
comes into your hut some night 
while you’re asleep? We could 
post guards and they wouldn’t even 
see the thing.” 

Brynes shuddered involuntarily. 
“Yeah, I guess you’re right. Maybe 
we’d better radio for help.” 

Eakins stood up. “Well, gents,” 
he said, “I guess that means me. I 
just hope the batteries on the ketch 
are up to charge.” 

“It’ll be dangerous going out 
there,” Drake said. “We’ll draw 
lots.” 

Eakins was amused. “We will? 
How many of you can operate a 
transmitter?” 

Drake said, “I can.” 

“No offense meant,” Eakins said, 
“but you don’t operate that set 



of yours worth a damn. You don’t 
even know Morse for key trans- 
mission. And can you fix the set if 
it goes out?” 

“No,” Drake said. But the whole 
thing is too risky. We all should 
go” 

Eakins shook his head. “Safest 
thing all around is if you cover me 
from the beach. That bug probably 
hasn’t thought about the ketch yet.” 

Eakins stuck a tool kit in his 
pocket and strapped one of the 
camp’s walkie-talkies over his 
shoulder. He handed the other one 
to Sorensen. He hurried down the 
beach past the launch and pushed 
the small dinghy into the water. 
The men of the expedition spread 
out, their rifles ready. Eakins got 
into the dinghy and started rowing 
across the quiet lagoon. 

They saw him tie up to the 
ketch and pause a moment, looking 
around. Then he climbed aboard. 
Quickly he slid back the hatch and 
went inside. 

“Everything all right?” Soren- 
sen asked. 

“No trouble yet,” Eakins said, 
his voice sounding thin and sharp 
over the walkie-talkie. “I’m at the 
transmitter now, turning it on. It 
needs a couple of minutes to warm 
up.” 

Drake nudged Sorensen. “Look 
over there.” 

On the reef, almost hidden by 
the ketch, something was moving. 
Using binoculars, Sorensen could

25 



see three big gray rats slipping into 
the water. They began swimming 
toward the ketch. 

“Start firing!” Sorensen said. 
“Eakins, get out of there!” 

“I’ve got the transmitter going,” 
Eakins said. “I just need a couple 
of minutes more to get a message 
off.” 

T> ULLETS sent up white splash- 
es around the swimming rats. 
One was hit; the other two man- 
aged to put the ketch between 
them and the riflemen. Studying 
the reef with his binoculars, Soren- 
sen saw an anteater cross the reef 
and splash into the water. It was 
followed by a wild pig. 

There was a crackle of static 
from the walkie-talkie. Sorensen 
called, “Eakins, have you got that 
message off?” 

“Haven’t sent it,” Eakins called 
back. “Listen, Bill. We mustn’t 
send any messages! That bug 
wants — ” He stopped abruptly. 

“What is it?” Sorensen asked. 
“What’s happening?” 

Eakins had appeared on deck, 
still holding the walkie-talkie. He 
was backing toward the stern. 

“Hermit crabs,” he said. “They 
climbed up the anchor line. I’m 
going to swim to shore.” 

“Don’t do it,” Sorensen said. 
“Gotta do it,” Eakins said. 
“They’ll probably follow me. All of 
you come out here and get that 
transmitter. Bring it ashore.” 



Through his binoculars, Soren- 
sen could see a solid gray carpet of 
hermit crabs crawling down the 
deck and waterways of the ketch. 
Eakins jumped into the water. He 
swam furiously toward shore, and 
Sorensen saw the rats turn and fol- 
low him. Hermit crabs swarmed off 
the boat, and the wild pig and the 
anteater paddled after him, trying 
to head him off before he reached 
the beach. 

“Come on,” Sorensen said. “I 
don’t know what Eakins figured 
out, but we better get that trans- 
mitter while we have a chance.” 

They ran down the beach and 
put the launch into the water. Two 
hundred yards away, Eakins had 
reached the far edge of the beach 
with the animals in close pursuit. 
He broke into the jungle, still cling- 
ing to his walkie-talkie. 

“Eakins?” Sorensen asked into 
the walkie-talkie. 

“I’m all right,” Eakins said, pant- 
ing hard for air. “Get that trans- 
mitter, and don’t forget the bat- 
teries!” 

The men boarded the ketch. 
Working furiously, they ripped the 
transmitter off its bulkhead and 
dragged it up the companionway 
steps. Drake came last, carrying a 
twelve-volt battery. He went down 
again and brought up a second bat- 
tery. He hesitated a moment, then 
went below for a third time. 

“Drake!” Sorensen shouted. 
“Quit holding us up!” 



26

Drake reappeared, carrying the 
ketch’s two radio direction finders 
and the compass. He handed them 
down and jumped into the launch. 

“OK,” he said. “Let’s go.” 

r 1 1 HEY rowed to the beach. 

Sorensen was tryin to re-estab- 
lish contact with Eakins on the 
walkie-talkie, but all he could hear 
was static. Then, as the launch 
grounded on the beach, he heard 
Eakins’ voice. 

“I’m surrounded,” he said, very 
quietly. “I guess I’ll have to see 
what Mr. Bug wants. Maybe I can 
swat him first, though.” 

There was a long silence. Then 
Eakins said, “It’s coming toward 
me now. Drake was right. It sure 
isn’t like any bug I’ve ever seen. 
I’m going to swat hell out of — ” 

They heard him scream, more 
in surprise than pain. 

Sorensen said, “Eakins, can you 
hear me? Where are you? Can we 
help?” 

“It sure is fast,” Eakins said, his 
voice conversational again. “Fast- 
est damned bug I’ve ever seen. 
Jumped on my neck, stung me and 
jumped off again.” 

“How do you feel?” Sorensen 
asked. 

“Fine,” Eakins said. “Hardly felt 
the sting.” 

“Where is the bug now?” 

“Back in the bush.” 

“The animals?” 

“They went away. You know,” 






Eakins said, “maybe this thing 
doesn’t work on humans. Maybe—” } 
“What?” Sorensen asked. “What’s I 
happening now?” 

There was a long silence. Then i 
Eakins’ voice, low-pitched and 
calm, came over the walkie-talkie, j 
“We’ll speak with you again 
later,” Eakins said. “We must take 
consultation now and decide what 
to do with you.” 

“Eakins!” 

There was no answer from the 
other end of the walkie-talkie. 

IV 

T> ETURNING to their camp, 
the men were in a mood of 
thorough depression. They couldn’t 
understand what had happened to 
Eakins and they didn’t feel like 
speculating on it. The ravaging af- 
ternoon sun beat down, reflecting 
heat back from the white sand. The 
damp jungle steamed, and appeared 
to creep toward them like a huge 
and sleepy green dragon, trapping 
them against the indifferent sea. 
Gun barrels grew too hot to touch, 
and the water in the canteens was 
as warm as blood. Overhead, thick 
gray cumulus clouds began to pile 
up; it was the beginning of the 
monsoon season. 

Drake sat in the shade of the 
copra shed. He shook off his leth- 
argy long enough to inspect the 
camp from the viewpoint of de- 
fense. He saw the encircling jungle 



as enemy territory. In front of it 
w as an area fifty yards deep which 
they had cleared. This no man’s 
land could perhaps be defended 
for a while. 

Then came the huts and the 
copra shed, their last line of de- 
fense, leading to the beach and the 
sea. 

The expedition had been in com- 
plete control of this island for bet- 
ter than three months. Now they 
were pinned to a small and pre- 
carious beachhead. 

Drake glanced at the lagoon be- 
hind him and remembered that 
there was still one line of retreat 
open. If the bug and his damned 
menagerie pressed too hard, they 
could still escape in the ketch. 
With luck. 

Sorensen came over and sat 
down beside him. “What are you 
doing?” he asked. 

Drake grinned sourly. “Planning 
our master strategy.” 

“How does it look?” 

“I think we can hold out,” Drake 
said. “We’ve got plenty of ammo. 
If necessary, we’ll interdict the 
cleared area with gasoline. We 
certainly aren’t going to let that 
bug push us off the island.” He 
thought for a moment. “But it’s 
going to be damned hard digging 
for treasure.” 

Sorensen nodded. “I wonder 
what the bug wants.” 

“Maybe we’ll find out from Ea- 
kins,” Drake said. 

MEETING OF THE MINDS 



T HEY had to wait half an hour. 

Then Eakins’ voice came, sharp 
and shrill over the walkie-talkie. 
“Sorensen? Drake?” 

“We’re here,” Drake said. “What 
did that damned bug do to you?” 
“Nothing,” Eakins said. “You are 
talking to that bug now. My name 
is the Quedak.” 

“My God,” Drake said to Soren- 
sen, “that bug must have hypno- 
tized him!” 

“No. You are not speaking to a 
hypnotized Eakins. Nor are you 
speaking to a creature who is 
simply using Eakins as a mouth- 
piece. Nor are you speaking to the 
Eakins who was. You are speaking 
to many individuals who are one.” 
“I don’t get that,” Drake said. 
“It’s very simple,” Eakins’ voice 
replied. “I am the Quedak, the 
totality. But my totality is made 
up of separate parts, which are 
Eakins, several rats, a dog named 
Oro, a pig, an anteater, a cas- 
sowary—” 

“Hold on,” Sorensen said. “Let 
me get this straight. This is not 
Eakins I’m speaking to. This is the 
— the Quedak?” 

“That is correct.” 

“And you control Eakins and the 
others? You speak through Eakins’ 
mouth?” 

“Also correct. But that doesn’t 
mean that the personalities of the 
others are obliterated. Quite the 
contrary, the Quedak state is a 
federation in which the various 



28 



GALAXY 



29 



member parts retain their idiosyn- 
crasies, their individual needs and 
desires. They give their knowledge, 
their power, their special outlook 
to the Quedak whole. The Quedak 
is the coordinating and command 
center; but the individual parts 
supply the knowledge, the insights, 
the special skills. And together we 
form the Great Cooperation.” 
“Cooperation?” Drake said. “But 
you did all this by force!” 

“It was necessary in the begin- 
ning. Otherwise, how would other 
creatures have known about the 
Great Cooperation?” 

‘Would they stay if you released 
your control over them?” Drake 
asked. 

“That is a meaningless question. 
We form a single indivisible entity 
now. Would your arm return to you 
if you cut it off?” 

“It isn’t the same thing.” 

“It is,” Eakins’ voice said. ‘We 
are a single organism. We are still 
growing. And we welcome you 
wholeheartedly into the Great 
Cooperation.” 

“To hell with that,” Drake said. 
“But you must join,” the Quedak 
told them. “It is the Quedak Mis- 
sion to coordinate all sentient 
creatures into a single collective 
organism. Believe me, there is only 
the most trifling loss of the indi- 
viduality you prize so highly. And 
you gain so much more! You learn 
the viewpoints and special knowl- 
edge of all other creatures. Within 



the Quedak framework you can 
fully realize your potentialities—” 

“No!” 

“I am sorry,” the Quedak said. 
“The Quedak Mission must be ful- 
filled. You will not join us wil- 
lingly?” 

“Never,” Drake said. 

“Then we will join you,” the 
Quedak said. 

There was a click as he turned 
off the walkie-talkie. 

17 ROM the fringe of the jungle, 
several rats appeared. They 
hesitated, just out of rifle range. A 
bird of paradise flew overhead, hov- 
ering over the cleared area like an 
observation plane. As the men 
watched, the rats began to run 
forward in long zigzags. 

“Start firing,” Drake called out. 
“But go easy with the ammo.” 

The men began to fire. But it 
was difficult to sight on the quick- 
moving rats against the grayish- 
brown clearing. And almost imme- 
diately, the rats were joined by a 
dozen hermit crabs. They had an 
uncanny knack for moving when 
no one was watching them, darting 
forward, then freezing against the 
neutral background. 

They saw Eakins appear on the 
fringe of the jungle. 

“Lousy traitor,” Cable said, rais- 
ing his rifle. 

Sorensen slapped the muzzle of 
the rifle aside. “Don’t do it.” 

“But he’s helping that bug!” 



30 



GALAXY 



“He can’t help it,” Sorensen said. 
“And he’s not armed. Leave him 
alone.” 

Eakins watched for a few mo- 
ments, then melted back into the 
jungle. 

The attack by the rats and crabs 
swept across half of the cleared 
space. Then, as they came closer, 
the men were able to pick their 
targets with more accuracy. Noth- 
ing was able to get closer than 
twenty yards. And when Recetich 
shot down the bird of paradise, the 
attack began to falter. 

“You know,” Drake said, “I think 
we’re going to be all right” 

“Could be,” said Sorensen. “I 
don’t understand what the Quedak 
is trying to accomplish. He knows 
we can’t be taken like this. I should 
think—” 

“Hey!” one of the men called 
out. “Our boat!” 

They turned and saw why the 
Quedak had ordered the attack. 
While it had occupied their atten- 
tion, Drake’s dog had swum out to 
the ketch and gnawed through the 
anchor line. Unattended, the ketch 
was drifting before the wind, mov- 
ing toward the reef. They saw it 
bump gently, then harder. In a 
moment it was heeled hard over, 
stuck in the coral. 

There was a burst of static from 
the walkie-talkie. Sorensen held it 
up and heard the Quedak say, “The 
ketch isn’t seriously damaged. It’s 
simply immobilized.” 



“The hell you say,” Drake 
growled. “For all you know, it’s got 
a whole punched right through it. 
How do you plan on getting off 
the island, Quedak? Or are you 
just going to stay here?” 

“I will leave at the proper time,” 
the Quedak said. “I want to make 
sure that we all leave together.” 

V 

T HE wind died. Huge gray 
thunderheads piled up in the 
sky to the southeast, their tops lost 
in the upper atmosphere, their 
black anvil bottoms pressing the 
hot still air upon the island. The 
sun had lost its fiery glare. Cherry- 
red, it slid listlessly toward the 
flat sea. 

High overhead, a single bird of 
paradise circled, just out of rifle 
range. It had gone up ten minutes 
after Recetich had shot the first 
one down. 

Monty Byrnes stood on the edge 
of the cleared area, his rifle ready. 
He had drawn the first guard shift. 
The rest of the men were eating a 
hasty dinner inside the copra shed. 
Sorensen and Drake were outside, 
looking over the situation. 

Drake said, “By nightfall we’ll 
have to pull everybody back into 
the shed. Can’t take a chance on 
being exposed to the Quedak in 
the dark.” 

Sorensen nodded. He seemed to 
have aged ten years in a day’s time. 



MEETING OF THE MINDS 



31 



“In the morning,” Drake said, 
“we’ll be able to work something 
out. We’ll . What’s wrong, Bill?” 

“Do you really think we have a 
chance?” Sorensen asked. 

“Sure we do. We’ve got a damned 
good chance.” 

“Be realistic,” Sorensen said. 
“The longer this goes on, the more 
animals the Quedak can throw 
against lis. What can we do about 
it?” 

“Hunt him out and kill him.” 

“The damned thing is about the 
size of your thumb,” Sorensen said 
irritably. “How can we hunt him?” 

“We’ll figure out something,” 
Drake said. He was beginning to 
get worried about Sorensen. The 
morale among the men was low 
enough without Sorensen pushing 
it down further. 

“I wish someone would shoot 
that damned bird,” Sorensen said, 
glancing overhead. 

About every fifteen minutes, the 
bird of paradise came darting down 
for a closer look at the camp. Then, 
before the guard had a chance to 
fire, he swept back up to a safe 
altitude. 

“It’s getting on my nerves, too,” 
Drake said. “Maybe that’s what 
it’s supposed to do. One of these 
times we’ll—” 

He stopped abruptly. From the 
copra shed he could hear the loud 
hum of a radio. And he heard A1 
Cable saying, “Hello, hello, this is 
Vuanu calling. We need help.” 



Drake and Sorensen went into 
the shed. Cable was sitting in front 
of the transmitter, saying into the 
microphone, “Emergency, emer- 
gency, Vuanu calling, we need—” 
“What in hell do you think 
you’re doing?” Drake snapped. 

ABLE turned and looked at 
^ him, his pudgy pink body 
streaked with sweat. “I’m radioing 
for help, that’s what I’m doing. I 
think I’ve picked up somebody. 
But they haven’t answered me 
yet.” 

He readjusted the tuning. Over 
the receiver, they could hear a 
bored British voice saying, “Pawn 
to Queen four, eh? Why don’t you 
ever try a different opening?” 
There was a sharp burst of static. 
“Just move,” a deep bass voice 
answered. “Just shut up and move.” 
“Sure,” said the British voice. 
“Knight to king bishop three.” 
Drake recognized the voices. 
They were ham radio operators. 
One of them owned a plantation 
on Bougainville; the other was a 
shopkeeper in Rabaul. They came 
on the air for an hour of chess and 
argument every evening. 

Cable tapped the microphone 
impatiently. “Hello,” he said, “this 
is Vuanu calling, emergency call—” 
Drake walked over and took the 
microphone out of Cable’s hand. 
He put it down carefully. 

“We can’t call for help,” he said. 
“What are you talking about?” 



32 



GALAXY 



Cable cried. “We have to!” 

Drake felt very tired. “Look, if 
W e send out a distress call, some- 
body’s going to come sailing right 
in — but they won’t be prepared 
for this kind of trouble. The Que- 
dak will take them over and then 
use them against us.” 

‘We can explain what the 
trouble is,” Cable said. 

“Explain? Explain what? That 
a bug is taking over the island? 
They’d think we were crazy with 
fever. They’d send in a doctor on 
the inter-island schooner.” 

“Dan’s right,” Sorensen said. 
“Nobody would believe this with- 
out seeing it for himself.” 

“And by then,” Drake said, “it’d 
be too late. Eakins figured it out 
before the Quedak got him. That’s 
why he told us not to send any 
messages.” 

Cable looked dubious. “But why 
did he want us to take the trans- 
mitter?” 

“So that he couldn’t send any 
messages after the bug got him,” 
Drake said. “The more people 
trampling around, the easier it 
would be for the Quedak. If he had 
possession of the transmitter, he’d 
be calling for help right now.” 
“Yeah, I suppose so,” Cable said 
unhappily. “But, damn it, we can’t 
handle this alone.” 

‘We have to. If the Quedak ever 
gets us and then gets off the island, 
that’s it for Earth. Period. There 
won’t be any big war, no hydrogen 



bombs or fallout, no heroic little 
resistance groups. Everybody will 
become part of the Quedak Co- 
operation.” 

‘We ought to get help somehow,” 
Cable said stubbornly. We’re 
alone, isolated. Suppose we ask for 
a ship to stand offshore—” 

“It won’t work,” Drake said. 
“Besides, we couldn’t ask for help 
even if we wanted to.” 

Why not?” 

“Because the transmitter’s not 
working,” Drake said. “You’ve been 
talking into a dead mike.” 

“It’s receiving OK,” Cable said. 

D RAKE checked to see if all the 
switches were on. “Nothing 
wrong with the receiver. But we 
must have joggled something tak- 
ing the transmitter out of the ship. 
It isn’t working.” 

Cable tapped the dead micro- 
phone several times, then put it 
down. They stood around the re- 
ceiver, listening to the chess game 
between the man in Rabaul and 
the man in Bougainville. 

“Pawn to queen bishop four.” 
“Pawn to king three.” 

“Knight to Queen bishop three.” 
There was a sudden staccato 
burst of static. It faded, then came 
again in three distinct bursts. 

“What do you suppose that is?” 
Sorensen asked. 

Drake shrugged his shoulders. 
“Could be anything. Storm’s shap- 
ing up and—” 



MEETING OF THE MINDS 



33 



He stopped. He had been stand- 
ing beside the door of the shed. As 
the static crackled, he saw the bird 
of paradise dive for a closer look. 
The static stopped when the bird 
returned to its slow-circling higher 
altitude. 

“That’s strange,” Drake said. 
“Did you see that, Bill? The bird 
came down and the static went on 
at the same time.” 

“I saw it,” Sorensen said. “Think 
it means anything?” 

“I don’t know. Let’s see.” Drake 
took out his field glasses. He turned 
up the volume of the receiver and 
stepped outside where he could 
observe the jungle. He waited, 
hearing the sounds of the chess 
game three or four hundred miles 
away. 

“Come on now, move.” 

“Give me a minute.” 

“A minute? Listen, I can’t stand 
in front of this bleeding set all 
night. Make your—” 

Static crackled sharply. Drake 
saw four wild pigs come trotting 
out of the jungle, moving slowly, 
like a reconnaissance squad prob- 
ing for weak spots in an enemy 
position. They stopped; the static 
stopped. Byrnes, standing guard 
with his rifle, took a snap shot at 
them. The pigs turned, and static 
crackled as they moved back into 
the jungle. There was more static 
as the bird of paradise swept down 
for a look, then climbed out of 
range. After that, the static stopped. 



Drake put down his binoculars 
and went back inside the shed. 
“That must be it,” he said. “The 
static is related to the Quedak. I 
think it comes when he’s operating 
the animals.” 

“You mean he has come sort of 
radio control over them?” Soren- 
sen asked. 

“Seems like it,” Drake said. 
“Either radio control or something 
propagated along a radio wave- 
length.” 

“If that’s the case,” Sorenson 
said, “he’s like a little radio sta- 
tion, isn’t he?” 

“Sure he is. So what?” 

“Then we should be able to lo- 
cate him on a radio direction 
finder,” Sorensen said. 

Drake nodded emphatically. He 
snapped off the receiver, went to 
a corner of the shed and took out 
one of their portable direction find- 
ers. He set it to the frequency at 
which Cable had picked up the 
Rabaul - Bougainville broadcast. 
Then he turned it on and walked 
to the door. 

HP HE men watched while Drake 
rotated the loop antenna. He 
located the maximum signal, then 
turned the loop slowly, read the 
bearing and converted it to a com- 
pass course. Then he sat down with 
a small-scale chart of the South- 
west Pacific. 

“Well,” Sorensen asked, “is it 
the Quedak?” 



34 



GALAXY 



“It’s got to be,” said Drake. “I 
located a good null almost due 
south. That’s straight ahead in the 
jungle.” 

‘You’re sure it isn’t a reciprocal 
bearing?” 

“I checked that out.” 

“Is there any chance the signal 
comes from some other station?” 
“Nope. Due south, the next sta- 
tion is Sydney, and that’s seven- 
teen hundred miles away. Much 
too far for this RDF. It’s the 
Quedak, all right.” 

“So we have a way of locating 
him,” Sorensen said. “Two men 
with direction finders can go into 
the jungle-” 

“—and get themselves killed,” 
Drake said. “We can position the 
Quedak with RDFs, but his ani- 
mals can locate us a lot faster. We 
wouldn’t have a chance in the 
jungle.” 

Sorensen looked crestfallen. 
‘Then we’re no better off than 
before.” 

‘We’re a lot better off,” Drake 
said. “We have a chance now.” 
What makes you think so?” 
“He controls the animals by 
radio,” Drake said. We know the 
frequency he operates on. We can 
broadcast on the same frequency. 
We can jam his signal.” 

“Are you sure about 'that?” 

“Am I sure? Of course not. But 
I do know that two stations in the 
same area can’t broadcast over the 
same frequency. If we tuned in to 
. 

MEETING OF THE MINDS 



the frequency the Quedak uses, 
made enough noise to override his 
signal—” 

“I see,” Sorensen said. “Maybe 
it would work! If we could inter- 
fere with his signal, he wouldn’t be 
able to control the animals. And 
then we could hunt him down with 
the RDFs.” 

“That’s the idea,” Drake said. 
“It has only one small flaw— our 
transmitter isn’t working. With no 
transmitter, we can’t do any broad- 
casting. No broadcasting, no jam- 
ming.” 

“Can you fix it?” Sorensen asked. 

“I’ll try,” Drake said. “But we’d 
better not hope for too much. 
Eakins was the radio man on this 
expedition.” 

We’ve got all the spare parts,” 
Sorensen said. “Tubes, manual, 
everything.” 

“I know. Give me enough time 
and I’ll figure out what’s wrong. 
The question is, how much time is 
the Quedak going to give us?” 

The bright copper disk of the 
sun was half submerged in the sea. 
Sunset colors touched the massing 
thunderheads and faded into the 
brief tropical twilight The men 
began to barricade the copra shed 
for the night 

VI 

"TkRAKE removed the back from 
the transmitter and scowled 
at the compact mass of tubes and 



35 



wiring. Those metal boxlike things 
were probably condensers, and the 
waxy cylindrical gadgets might or 
might not be resistors. It all looked 
hopelessly complicated, ridicu- 
lously dense and delicate. Where 
should he begin? 

He turned on the set and waited 
a few minutes. All the tubes ap- 
peared to go on, some dim, some 
bright. He couldn’t detect any 
loose wires. The mike was still 
dead. 

So much for visual inspection. 
Next question: was the set getting 
enough juice? 

He turned it off and checked 
the battery cells with a voltmeter. 
The batteries were up to charge. 
He removed the leads, scraped 
them and put them back on, mak- 
ing sure they fit snugly. He checked 
all connections, murmured a pro- 
pitiatory prayer, and turned the 
set on. 

It still didn’t work. 

Cursing, he turned it off again. 
He decided to replace all the 
tubes, starting with the dim ones. 
If that didn’t work, he could try 
replacing condensers and resistors. 
If that didn’t work, he could al- 
ways shoot himself. With this 
cheerful thought, he opened the 
parts kit and went to work. 

The men were all inside the 
copra shed, finishing the job of 
barricading it for the night. The 
door was wedged shut and locked. 
The two windows had to be kept 



open for ventilation; otherwise 
everyone would suffocate in the 
heat. But a double layer of heavy 
mosquito netting was nailed over 
each window, and a guard was 
posted beside it. 

Nothing could get through the 
flat galvanized-iron roof. The 
floor was of pounded earth, a 
possible danger point. All they 
could do was keep watch over it. 

The treasure-hunters settled 
down for a long night. Drake, with 
a handkerchief tied around his 
forehead to keep the perspira- 
tion out of hTs eyes, continued 
working on the transmitter. 

A N hour later, there was a buzz 
on the walkie-talkie. Soren- 
sen picked it up and said, “What 
do you want?” 

“I want you to end this senseless 
resistance,” said the Quedak, speak- 
ing with Eakins’ voice. “You’ve 
had enough time to think over the 
situation. I want you to join me. 
Surely you can see there’s no other 
way.” 

“We don’t want to join you,” 
Sorensen said. 

“You must,” the Quedak told 
him. 

“Are you going to make us?” 
“That poses problems,” the Que- 
dak said. “My animal parts are not 
suitable for coercion. Eakins is an 
excellent mechanism, but there is 
only one of him. And I must not 
expose myself to unnecessary dan- 



ger. By doing so I would endanger 
the Quedak Mission.” 

“So it’s a stalemate,” Sorensen 

said. 

“No. I am faced with difficulty 
only in taking you over. There is 
no problem in killing you.” 

The men shifted uneasily. 
Drake, working on the transmitter, 
didn’t look up. 

“I would rather not kill you,” the 
Quedak said. “But the Quedak 
Mission is of primary importance. 
It would be endangered if you 
didn’t join. It would be seriously 
compromised if you left the island. 
So you must either join or be 
killed.” 

“That’s not the way I see it,” 
Sorensen said. “If you killed us— 
assuming that you can — you’d 
never get off this island. Eakins 
can’t handle that ketch.” 

‘There would be no need to 
leave in the ketch,” the Quedak 
said. “In six months, the inter- 
island schooner will return. Eakins 
and I will leave then. The rest of 
you will have died,” 

re Sorensen said. 

•What makes you think you could 
kill us? You didn’t do so well to- 
day.” He caught Drake’s attention 
and gestured at the radio. Drake 
shrugged his shoulders and went 
back to work. 

“I wasn’t trying,” the Quedak 
said. “The time for that was at 
night. This night, before you have 
a chance to work out a better sys- 



tem of defense. You must join me 
tonight or I will kill one of you.” 
“One of us?” 

“Yes. One man an hour. In that 
way, perhaps the survivors will 
change their minds about joining. 
But if they don’t, all of you will be 
dead by morning.” 

Drake leaned over aad whis- 
pered to Sorensen, “Stall him. 
Give me another ten minutes. I 
think I’ve found the trouble.” 
Sorensen said into the walkie- 
talkie, “We’d like to know a little 
more about the Quedak Coopera- 
tion.” 

“You can find out best by join- 
ing.” 

‘We’d rather have a little more 
information on it first.” 

46 T T is an indescribable state,” 
the Quedak said in an urgent, 
earnest, eager voice. “Can you 
imagine yourself as yourself and 
yet experiencing an entirely new 
series of sensory 'you 

woulH, *~ r exam pi ej experience the 
world through the perceptors of a 
dog as he goes through the forest 
following an odor which to him— 
and to you — is as clear and vivid 
as a painted line. A hermit crab 
senses things differently. From him 
you experience the slow interaction 
of life at the margin of sea and 
land. His time-sense is very slow, 
unlike that of a bird of paradise, 
whose viewpoint is spatial, rapid, 
cursory. And there are many oth- 



36

MEETING OF THE MINDS 



37 



ers, above and below the earth and 
water, who furnish their own spe- 
cialized viewpoints of reality. Their 
outlooks, I have found, are not 
essentially different from those of 
the animals that once inhabited 
Mars.” 

“What happened on Mars?” 
Sorensen asked. 

“All life died,” the Quedak 
mourned. “All except the Quedak. 
It happened a long time ago. For 
centuries there was peace and pros- 



perity on the planet Everything 
and everyone was part of the Que- 
dak Cooperation. But the dominant 
race was basically weak. Their 
breeding rate went down; catastro- 
phes happened. And finally there 
was no more life except the 
Quedak.” 

“Sounds great,” Sorensen said 
ironically. 

“It was the fault of die race,” the 
Quedak protested. “With sturdier 
stock — such as you have on this 



planet— the will to live will remain 
intact. The peace and prosperity 
will continue indefinitely.” 

“I don’t believe it What hap- 
pened on Mars will happen again 
0 n Earth if you take over. After 
a while, slaves just don’t care very 
strongly about living.” 

“You wouldn’t be slaves. You 
would be functional parts of the 
Quedak Cooperation.” 

“Which would be run by you,” 
Sorensen said. “Any way you slice 



it, it’s the same old pie.” 

“You don’t know what you’re 
talking about,” the Quedak said. 
“We have talked long enough. I 
am prepared to kill one man in the 
next five minutes. Are you or are 
you not going to join me?” Soren- 
sen looked at Drake. Drake turned 
on the transmitter. 

Gusts of rain splattered on the 
roof while the transmitter warmed 
up. Drake lifted the microphone 
and tapped it, and was able to hear 




38 



GALAXY 



MEETING OF THE MINDS 



39 




the sound in the speaker. 

“It’s working,” he said. 

A T that moment something flew 
against the netting-covered 
window. The netting sagged; a 
fruit bat was entangled in it, glar- 
ing at them with tiny red-rimmed 
eyes. 

“Get some boards over that 
window!” Sorensen shouted. 

As he spoke, a second bat hur- 
tled into the netting, broke through 
it and tumbled to the floor. The 
men clubbed it to death, but four 
more bats flew in through the open 
window. Drake flailed at them, 
but he eouldn’t drive them away 
from the transmitter. They were 
diving at his eyes, and he was 
forced back. A wild blow caught 
one bat and knocked it to the floor 
with a broken wing. Then the oth- 
ers had reached the transmitter. 

They pushed it off the table. 
Drake tried to catch the set, and 
failed. He heard the glass tubes 
shattering, but by then he was busy 
protecting his eyes. 

In a few minutes they had killed 
two more bats, and the others had 
fled out the window. The men 
nailed boards over both windows, 
and Drake bent to examine the 
transmitter. 

“Any chance of fixing it?” Soren- 
sen asked. 

“Not a hope,” Drake said. “They 
ripped out the wiring while they 
were at it.” 



“What do we do now?” 

“I don’t know.” 

Then the Quedak spoke to them 
over the walkie-talkie. “I must 
have your answer right now.” 
Nobody said a word. 

“In that case,” the Quedak said, 
“I’m deeply sorry that one of you 
must die now.” 

VII 

R AIN pelted the iron roof and 
the gusts of wind increased 
in intensity. There were rumbles 
of distant thunder. But within the 
copra shed, the air was hot and 
still. The gasoline lantern hanging 
from the center beam threw a 
harsh yellow light that illumi- 
nated the center of the room but 
left the corners in deep shadow. 
The treasure-hunters had moved 
away from the walls. They were 
all in the center of the room facing 
outward, and they made Drake 
think of a herd of buffalo drawn 
up against a wolf they could smell 
but could not see. 

Cable said, “Listen, maybe we 
should try this Quedak Coopera- 
tion. Maybe it isn’t so bad as—” 
“Shut up,” Drake said. 

“Be reasonable,” Cable argued. 
“It’s better than dying, isn’t it?” 
“No one’s dying yet,” Drake 
said. “Just shut up and keep your 
eyes open.” 

“I think I’m going to be sick,” 
Cable said. “Dan, let me out.” 

GALAXY 



“Be sick where you are,” Drake 
said. “Just keep your eyes open.” 

“You can’t give me orders,” 
Cable said. He started toward the 
door. Then he jumped back. 

A yellowish scorpion had crept 
under the inch of clearance be- 
tween the door and the floor. Rece- 
tich stamped on it, smashing it to 
pulp under his heavy boots. Then 
he whirled, swinging at three hor- 
nets which had come at him 
through the boarded windows. 

“Forget the hornets!” Drake 
shouted. “Keep watching the 
ground!” 

There was movement on the 
floor. Several hairy spiders crawled 
out of the shadows. Drake and 
Recetich beat at them with rifle 
butts. Byrnes saw something crawl- 
ing under the door. It looked like 
some kind of huge flat centipede. 
He stamped at it, missed, and the 
centipede was on his boot, past it, 
on the flesh of his leg. He screamed; 
it felt like a ribbon of molten metal. 
He was able to smash it flat before 
he passed out. 

Drake checked the wound and 
decided it was not fatal. He 
stamped on another spider, then 
felt Sorensen’s hand clutching his 
shoulder. He looked toward the 
corner Sorensen was pointing at. 

Sliding toward them were two 
large, dark-coated snakes. Drake 
recognized them as black adders. 
These normally shy creatures were 
coming forward like tigers. 

MEETING OF THE MINDS 



T HE men panicked, trying to 
get away from the snakes. 
Drake pulled out his revolver and 
dropped to one knee, ignoring the 
hornets that buzzed around him, 
trying to draw a bead on the slen- 
der serpentine targets in the sway- 
ing yellow light 

Thunder roared directly over- 
head. A long flash of lightning sud- 
denly flooded the room, spoiling 
his aim. Drake fired and missed, 
and waited for the snakes to strike. 

They didn’t strike. They were 
moving away from him, retreating 
to the rat hole from which they had 
emerged. One of the adders slid 
quickly through. The other began 
to follow, then stopped, half in 
the hole. 

Sorensen took careful aim with 
a rifle. Drake pushed the muzzle 
aside. “Wait just a moment.” 

The adder hesitated. It came 
out of the hole and began to move 
toward them again . 

And there was another crash of 
thunder and a vivid splash of 
lightning. The snake turned away 
and squirmed through the hole. 
“What’s going on?” Sorensen 
“Is the thunder frightening 

them?” 

“No, it’s the lightning!” Drake 
said. “That’s why the Quedak was 
in such a rush. He saw that a storm 
was coming, and he hadn’t con- 
solidated his position yet.” 

“What are you talking about?” 
“The lightning,” Drake said. 

41 



40 



“The electrical storm! It’s jamming 
that radio control of his! And when 
he’s jammed, the beasts revert to 
normal behavior. It takes him time 
to re-establish control.” 

“The storm won’t last forever,” 
Cable said. 

“But maybe it’ll last long 
enough,” Drake said. He picked 
up the direction finders and 
handed one to Sorensen. “Come 
on, Bill. We’ll hunt out that bug 
right now.” 

“Hey,” Recetich said, “isn’t there 
something I can do?” 

“You can start swimming if we 
don’t come back in an hour,” Drake 
said. 

T N slanting lines the rain drove 
down, pushed by the wild 
southwest wind. Thunder rolled 
continually and each flash of light- 
ning seemed aimed at them. Drake 
and Sorensen reached the edge of 
the jungle and stopped. 

“We’ll separate here,” Drake 
said. “Gives us a better chance 
of converging on him.” 

“Right,” Sorensen said. “Take 
care of yourself, Dan.” 

Sorensen plunged into the jun- 
gle. Drake trotted fifty yards down 
the fringe and then entered the 
bush. 

He pushed forward, the revolver 
in his belt, the radio direction 
finder in one hand, a flashlight in 
the other. The jungle seemed to 
be animated by a vicious life of its 

42 



own, almost as if the Quedak con- 
trolled it. Vines curled cunningly 
around his ankles and the bushes 
reached out thorny hands toward 
him. Every branch took a special 
delight in slapping his face. 

Each time the lightning flashed, 
Drake’s direction finder tried to 
home on it. He was having a diffi- 
cult time staying on course. But, 
he reminded himself, the Quedak 
was undoubtedly having an even 
more difficult time. Between flash- 
es, he was able to set a course. The 
further he penetrated into the 
jungle, the stronger the signal 
became. 

After a while he noticed that the I 
flashes of lightning were spaced I 
more widely apart. The storm was I 
moving on toward the north, leav- 
ing the island behind. How much 
longer would he have the protec- 
tion of the lightning? Another ten 
or fifteen minutes? 

He heard something whimper. 
He swung his flashlight around and 
saw his dog, Oro, coming toward 
him. 

His dog - or the Quedak’s dog? 

“Hey there, boy,” Drake said. 
He wondered if he should drop the 
direction finder and get the re- 
volver out of his belt. He wond- 
ered if the revolver would still 
work after such a thorough soak- 
ing. 

Oro came up and licked his 
hand. He was Drake’s dog, at least 
for the duration of the storm. 

GALAXY 



They moved on together, and 
the thunder rumbled distantly in 
the north. The signal on his RDF 
was very strong now. Somewhere 
around here . 

He saw light from another flash- 
light. Sorensen, badly out of breath, 
had joined him. The jungle had 
ripped and clawed at him, but he 
still had his rifle, flashlight and 
direction finder. 

Oro was scratching furiously at 
a bush. There was a long flash of 
lightning, and in it they saw the 
Quedak. 

D RAKE realized, in those final 
moments, that the rain had 
stopped. The lightning had 
stopped, too. He dropped the di- 
rection finder. With the flashlight 
in one hand and his revolver in the 
other, he tried to take aim at the 
Quedak, who was moving, who had 
jumped— 

To Sorensen’s neck, just above 
the right collarbone. 

Sorensen raised his hands, then 
lowered them again. He turned 



toward Drake, raising his rifle. His 
face was perfectly calm. He looked 
as though his only purpose in life 
was to kill Drake. 

Drake fired from less than two 
feet away. Sorensen spun with the 
impact, dropped his rifle' and fell. 

Drake bent over him, his re- 
volver ready. He saw that he had 
fired accurately. The bullet had 
gone in just above the right collar- 
bone. It was a bad wound. But it 
had been much worse for the 
Quedak, who had been in the direct 
path of the bullet. All that was left 
of the Quedak was a splatter of 
black across Sorensen’s chest. 

Drake applied hasty first aid 
and hoisted Sorensen to his 
shoulders. He wondered what he 
would have done if the Quedak 
had been standing above Soren- 
sen’s heart, or on his throat, or on 
his head. 

He decided it was better not to 
think about that. 

He started back to camp, with 
his dog trotting along beside him.

MEETING OF THE MINDS 43 



The Nuse Man 

If you ever dig Ur and find one 
man buried seven times — here is 
the nastily simple explanation. 

BY MARGARET ST. CLAIR 
Illustrated by WOOD 



1 DON’T know why, really, the 
nuse man comes to call on me. 
He must realize by now I’ll 
never order a nuse installation or 
an ipsissifex from him; I consider 
them as dangerous as anything our 
own lethal age has produced. Nuse, 
which is a power source that the 
nuse man describes as originating 
on the far side of 3000 AJD., is the 
worse of the two, but the ipsissifex, 
a matter duplicator, is bad enough. 



And though I listen to the nuse 
man’s stories, I can hardly be con- 
sidered a sympathetic audience. I 
suppose he drops in because I can 
always be depended on for a cup I 
of tea and some toast and marma- 1 
lade. 

“Hello,” he said as I answered I 
the bell. “You’ve aged in the last | 
six months.” 

Before I could wrap my tongue 
around the obvious et tu (he was 

GALAXY 



looking terrible— his clothes looked 
as if they had been slept in by 
machinery, and there were bruises 
and cuts and lumps all over his 
face) he had pushed past me into 
the living room and was sitting 
down in my husband’s easy chair. 
The dachshunds, who have never 
liked the nuse man, were growling 
at him earnestly. He put his feet up 
on the fireplace and lay back in 
the chair on his spine. 

“Ahhhhhh!” he sighed, and then, 
to me, “Put more butter on the 
toast than you did last time.” 
When I came back with the tea, 
he was standing by one of the book- 
cases looking at Woolley’s little 
book, Ur: The First Phases. 

“Silly book,” he grumbled. “That 
stuff about the plano-convex bricks 
is all wrong.” 

“What do you know about it?” 
I asked him. 

“I sold a nuse installation to 
King Nebu-kalam-dug of Ur of the 
Chaldees on this last trip.” 

“Oh, yes? Well, the home office 
ought to be pleased with you. Per- 
haps they’ll give you a vacation 
back in your own time.” 

The nuse man made no direct 
answer, but his battered, lumpy 
face grew dark. He bit into a slice 
of toast so savagely that I feared 
for his iridium alloy teeth. 

“Don’t tell me that something 
went wrong with the nuse again!” I 
cried. 

This time he couldn’t have an- 
THE NUSE MAN 



swered if he had wanted to. He had 
choked over some toast crumbs, 
and I had to beat him on the back 
and pour tea down him before he 
could speak. 

“Why are you so prejudiced 
against nuse?” he demanded at last. 
“The nuse had nothing to do with 
it. It was the king and the priests 
that birded it up.” 

“I’ll bet.” 

HP HE nuse man’s face turned 
even redder. It was a shade 
or two darker than the lapels 
around the waist of his trousers. 
“I’ll tell you all about it!” he said 
passionately. “You be the judge!” 
“Oh, Lord.” There was no polite 
way of getting out of it. “All right,” 
I said. 

“Everything was going fine,” the 
nuse man began, “until the old 
King, Nebu-kalam-dug, died. I’d 
sold him a nuse installation—” 
“General or special?” 

“Special, of course. Do I look 
like fool enough to put a general 
nuse installation into the hands of 
a lot of 3000 B.C. yaps? I sold him 
a special nuse installation in ex- 
change for a stated number of Su- 
merian gold artifacts, so many on 
installation and so many each lunar 
month until the price was paid.” 
“What were the artifacts?” 

“Gold wreaths and necklaces and 
jewelry. Of course, gold’s nothing. 
Only good for lavatory daises. But 
the workmanship was interesting 



44 



45 



and valuable. I knew the home of- 
fice would be pleased. Then the old 
yoop died.” 

“What killed him?” 

“His son, Nebu-al-karsig, poi- 
soned him.” 

“Oh.” 

“Everybody in the court knew 
it, but of course nobody would talk 
about it. I was sorry the old king 
died, but I wasn’t worried, because 
I thought I could work out the 
same sort of deal with the new king. 
Even when I saw how scared the 
court ladies looked when they were 
getting ready for the funeral, I 
didn’t apperceive. And then the sol- 
diers came and arrested me!” 
“What had you done?” I asked 
suspiciously. 

“Nothing. They were short little 
tzintes with big muscles, and they 
wore sort of skirts out of sheep- 
skin with the wool twisted into 
bunches to look elegant. They 
wouldn’t say a word while they 
were arresting me. Then I found 
out I was supposed to be strangled 
and put in the royal tomb with the 
dead king.” 

“Why?” 

“Because I’d been one of the old 
man’s special friends. At least, that 
was what young Nebu-al-karsig 
said. The prime minister and two 
or three of the councilors were be- 
ing strangled along with me.” 
“Gosh.” 

“I argued and argued, and talked 
and talked. I told the young king 

46 



we hadn’t been such good friends 
as all that. And finally he said, very 
well, I could go with the court 
ladies in the death pit.” 

“Were you scared?” 

“Of course I was scared,” the 
nuse man said irritably. “I didn’t 
have my chronnox— they’d arrested 
me in too much of a hurry for that 
—so I couldn’t get into another time. 
And I had no way of getting in 
touch with the home office. Cer- 
tainly I was scared. And then there 
was the indignity — somebody from 
when I come from, to be killed by 
a lot of primitive button heads. It 
made me sore.” 

TTE slurped at his tea. “When we 
got to the pit,” he continued, 
“they were just closing the old 
king’s tomb up. You understand, 
the tomb was at the bottom of the 
pit, and there was a ramp leading 
down into it. They hung matting 
over the sides of the pit, to cover 
the earth, and then they backed 
old Nebu-kalam-dug’s war chariot 
down the ramp; he’d want his 
chariot in the next world. Then the 
rest of us went down the ramp into 
the pit.” 

“Who was ‘us’?” I asked curious- 
ly- 

“Oh, harpists and singers and 
court ladies and slaves and soldiers 
and attendants. If anybody didn’t 
want to go, the soldiers had spears 
they used for prodding. I counted, 
and there were fifty-eight of us.” 



GALAXY 



“Pretty barbarous,” I said sym- 
pathetically. 

“Nobody from your period has 
any right to call anything barba- 
rous,” the nuse man said severely. 
“I’ve seen some bad ages, but 
yours — ! Anyway, there we were. 

“The funeral services began. The 
harpists twanged on their harps and 
the singers sang in high falsetto 
voices. It sounded awful. The 
priests chanted prayers from the 
edge of the pit above. The soldiers 
passed' around an opiate in little 
bronze cups for us to drink. The 
priests prayed some more. It was 
beginning to get dark. Then they 
started shoveling earth in on us.” 

“Were you sorry for the others?” 
I asked. 

“I was more sorry for myself. It 
was their era, and if they wanted 
to die in it, that was their business. 
After all, they thought that when 
they woke up they’d go on serving 
old Nebu-kalam-dug in the next 
world. I didn’t — and even if I had, 
he was nobody I’d want to serve.” 

“How did you get out?” I asked 
quickly. I did not like the thought 
of the scene in the death pit, even 
if it had taken place so many thou- 
sands of years ago. 

“I got under the car of the chariot 
to shelter myself from being 
crushed. After a long while, the 
earth stopped coming in and I de- 
cided the mourners had gone away. 

I didn’t have my chronnox, and, as 
I told you, I couldn’t get in touch 

THE NUSE MAN 



with the home office. But I was 
wearing an ipsissifex. I started ma- 
terializing myself up through the 
earth of the pit.” 

“You didn’t!” I said incredulous- 
ly- 

“I did, though. Each ‘me’ was a 
little farther up through the earth 
layer of the pit.” 

“You mean there are five or six 
‘you’s buried back there in Ur of 
the Chaldees?” 

“Seven. Of course they weren’t 
really alive — you know how an ip- 
sissifex is.” 

TT was the first time I had ever 
heard the nuse man admit that 
one of the devices he was peddling 
might have a flaw. 

“I clawed my way up through 
the last few inches of dirt without 
any more materializations,” he 
said, “and started walking up the 
ramp. There was a soldier on guard 
at the top. When he saw me, his 
spear began to shake. It shook so 
much he could hardly hold it. The 
moon was coming up, and my 
shadow fell in front of me on the 
ramp. 

“He licked his lips and swal- 
lowed before he could say anything. 
‘Get back in the pit and die,’ he 
said finally. ‘What are you doing 
out here? You’re supposed to serve 
our lord Nebu-kalam-dug in the 
other world. Go on back and be 
dead.’ 

“I didn’t say anything. I just 

47

GALAXY 



kept walking closer to him. When I 
w as about two feet away, he 
dropped his spear and ran. 

“I didn’t have any trouble get- 
ting in at the palace, either. Young 
Nebu-al-karsig was playing check- 
ers on a fiddle-shaped board with 
one of his girls when I walked into 
the great hall. When he saw me, 
he jumped up and the board fell 
to one side and the pieces rolled 
over the floor. I said, ‘My lord 
Nebu-al-karsig, I am harder to kill 
than your noble father was.’ 

“He had turned a dirty green- 
ish tan. He said, ‘I saw — I saw — ’ 

“I sat down on the floor in front 
of him and bumped my head on it 
a couple of times to show I was 
going to be polite. Then I said, in 
a deep, serious voice, ‘A magician 
cannot die until his time has come, 
my lord. Shall we discuss extend- 
ing the nuse installation I made for 
your respected sire?’ And he said, 
‘Yes, let’s.’” 

“It’s a wonder he didn’t try to 
poison you,” I commented. 

“Scared to,” the nuse man said 
briefly. “Anyhow, we agreed I was 
to increase the nuse installation by 
one third, and in return Nebu-al- 
karsig was to pay me twice as many 
gold artifacts each lunar month as 
his father had, and for half again 
as long. It took a lot of figuring and 
explaining by the royal scribes be- 
fore the king could understand the 
terms of the agreement, but he fi- 
nally was satisfied with the arith- 



metic. Oh, and I got my old rooms 
in the palace back.” 

“What did the special installa- 
tion do?” I poured the last of the 
tea into the nuse man’s cup and 
went out to the kitchen to put water 
on to heat for more. 

“It made bricks,” he said when I 
came back. “Beautiful, even, true, 
symmetrical mud bricks. Nebu- 
kalam-dug had been crazy about 
those bricks, and even Nebu-al- 
karsig thought they were pretty 
neat. You should have seen the 
adobe junk the brickmakers had 
been turning out by hand — sloppy, 
roundish affairs, all different sizes, 
with straw sticking out of them. 
Yes, my installation made bricks.” 

“What did they use the bricks 
for?” I asked. 

“For ziggurats — stepped temple 
pyramids. They made the first 
story black, the second white, the 
third red, and the last blue. Some- 
times, just for a change, they’d do 
an all-blue or an all-red pyramid. 

“For a while, everything was fine. 
Ziggurats were going up all over 
the place, and the skyline of Ur 
altered rapidly. The priests were 
pleased because all those ziggurats 
meant more priests were needed. 
Nebu-al-karsig was pleased because 
he was going down in history as the 
greatest ziggurat builder of his 
dynasty. And I was pleased be- 
cause I was getting a lot of elegant 
artifacts. Then things started to 
go sour.” 



THE NUSE MAN 



49 



“The nuse,” I murmured. “I 
knew it.” 

r I ''HE nuse man glared at me. 

“It . was . not . the . 
nuse!” he said, biting off the words. 
“What happened was the brick- 
makers started to get sore. They 
were out of jobs, you see, because 
of the nuse. And the bricklayers 
were almost as badly off. They 
were working twelve hours a day, 
seven days a week, without any 
overtime, trying to use up all the 
bricks. Pretty soon there would be 
riots in the streets. 

“Nebu-al-karsig asked me what 
I thought he ought to do. I told him, 
let the brickmakers into the brick- 
layers’ guild. That way he’d have 
twice as many men to build zig- 
gurats. So he issued a decree. And 
then there were riots in the streets. 

“ ‘What,’ said the bricklayers, ‘let 
those dirty sheep’s livers into our 
union? When they haven’t served 
a seven years’ apprenticeship?’ 
What,’ said the brickmakers, ‘be 
forced to give up our noble art, 
sacred to Nintud since time im- 
memorial, in exchange for slicking 
mud paste over heartless mechani- 
cal bricks?’ Then both sides 
shrieked ‘Never!’ and barricades, 
made out of brick baskets and cob- 
blestones, began to go up every- 
where. 

“I suppose the fuss would have 
died down in time. People— as your 
age has learned — can get used to 



anything. But Nebu-al-karsig was 
sleeping badly. Palace gossip had it 
that he’d wake up screaming from 
dreams about his father. He asked 
the priests what the cause of the 
trouble was, and they told him that 
some of the minor gods, those who 
hadn’t got ziggurats yet, were mad 
at him. The people in Ur had about 
four thousand gods. So he decided 
to have the nuse installation turn 
out more bricks. 

“Every morning, as soon as it 
was daylight, a bunch of shave- 
headed priests would file into the 
nuse factory. They’d stand in front 
of the installation, concentrating, 
for an hour, and then a new batch 
of priests would come. They kept 
that up all day. Nuse, of course, is 
basically a neural force. By the end 
of the day, bricks would be simply 
pouring out of the brick hoppers. 
Even to me, who had nothing to do 
with laying them, seeing all those 
mountains and mountains of bricks 
was very discouraging. 

“I tried to argue with Nebu-al- 
karsig about it. I told him as polite- 
ly as I could that he was endanger- 
ing his throne. But he’d never liked 
me, and after the episode of the 
brickmakers’ guild, he hadn’t 
trusted me. He wouldn’t listen. I 
decided it was time I got out of Ur. 

“I had one more installment of 
artifacts due me. I would collect 
that and then leave. By now the 
chest of artifacts in my bedroom 
was almost full. 



50 



GALAXY 



“The day of the installment 
came and went, and no artifacts. I 
mentioned it to Nebu-al-karsig and 
he showed his teeth at me. But on 
the next day, ten or twelve priests 
came to my rooms with a little box. 
The head priest opened it and gave 
it to me. In it were the missing arti- 
facts. 

“They weren’t quite what my 
contract called for, but I was glad 
to get them. I thanked the head 
priest for them as nicely as I knew 
how, and he smiled and suggested 
that we have a drink. I said fine, 
and he poured it out One of the 
minor priests was carrying goblets 
and the wineskin. I put out my 
hand for the cup and the head 
priest — did I tell you I’d put a 
small general nuse installation in 
my rooms?” 

1 THOUGHT back. “No, you 
didn’t.” 

“Well, I had,” said the nuse man. 
“I wasn’t going to be bothered 
with slow, stupid slaves waiting on 
me. I put out my hand for the cup 
and the priest went sailing up in the 
air. He hit on the ceiling with a 
considerable thump. Then he went 
around the room, floating just at 
eye-level, and whacked solidly 
against each of the four corners. He 
hit the fourth corner harder and 
faster than he had the first. I could 
see that his mouth was open and 
he looked scared. 

“There was a kind of pause 



while he hovered in the air. Then 
he went up and hit the ceiling, came 
down toward the floor, up to the 
ceiling, down again, up, hovered, 
and then came down on the floor 
for the last time with a great crash- 
ing whump! He landed so hard I 
thought I felt the floor shake. I 
knew he must be hurt. 

“I stood there frozen for a mo- 
ment. I couldn’t imagine what had 
happened. Then it came to me. 
The drink in my cup had been 
poisoned. I suppose Nebu-al-karsig 
hadn’t had nerve enough to do it 
himself. And the nuse installation 
in my room hadn’t let the head 
priest get away with it. 

“A nuse never makes a mistake. 
‘The airy servitor. Don’t think, use 
nuse.’ The more I sell it, the more 
I’m convinced that it’s wonderful 
stuff. This time it had saved my 
life. I couldn’t help wishing for a 
minute, though, that it had just 
tipped over the poisoned cup quiet- 
ly, because banging a priest around 
like that was sure to be sacrilege. 

“The other priests had been as 
surprised as I was. Now they began 
to mutter and heft the clubs they 
were carrying. The nuse might be 
able to handle all of them at once, 
but I didn’t wait to find out. I made 
a dash into the next room and 
bolted the door. 

“I was wearing my chronnox. All 
I had to do was grab my chest of 
artifacts and go to some other time. 
I made a dive under the bed for 



THE NUSE MAN 



51 



the chest. And it wasn’t there.” 

“Stolen?” I asked helpfully. 

The nuse man shook his head. 
“No, I don’t think so. Not with a 
nuse installation on guard. I think 
the nuse had levitated the chest to 
some safe place for extra security. 
I concentrated on getting the nuse 
to bring the chest back, and I did 
hear noises, levitation noises, as 
though it were trying to obey me. 
But it had all it could do to handle 
the priests in the next room. 

“By now there was a consider- 
able commotion in the palace. 
Doors were opening, people were 
shouting, I heard soldiers outside 
in the hall. Thumps and bumps 
from my sitting room showed that 
the nuse was still doing what it 
could with the priests, but several 
people were throwing themselves 
as hard as they could against the 
connecting door. I didn’t know how 
much longer the bolts would hold. 

“I tried concentrating on getting 
the nuse to abandon the priests and 
bring me my chest. I’m sure it 
would have worked in another 
minute. But then there was a lot of 
yelling and they began using a ram 
on the door. One of the panels 
busted. The hinges were sagging. I 
had to go.” 

'T’HE nuse man looked so de- 
pressed that I poured him out 
more tea. Just as I had suspected 
in the beginning, the nuse — always 
incalculable, always tricky, the es- 



sence of unreliability — the nuse 
had been at the bottom of his 
troubles. It always was. I had too 
much sense to say so, though. 

“What was the point you were 
making about the- plano-convex 
bricks?” I finally asked. 

The nuse man looked even more 
gloomy. I wished I hadn’t men- 
tioned it. He picked a leaf out of 
his tea with his spoon and frowned 
savagely at it. 

“I went back to Ur,” he said final- 
ly. “I wanted to see what had hap- 
pened about the bricks, and of 
course I wanted my chest. I picked 
a time about ten years later.” 

“Well?” 

‘ The first thing I noticed was 
the skyline. Every one of the zig- 
gurats Nebu-al-karsig had put up 
was gone. I walked up to where 
one of them had been, and there 
was nothing but a heap of bricks, 
and the bricks looked as if people 
had pounded them with hammers. 

I walked on to the center of 
town where the royal palace had 
been. It was gone, too, and what 
looked like a new royal palace was 
going up to the north of it. It was 
plain what had happened. There 
had been a revolution, Nebu-al- 
karsig had been overthrown, Ur 
had a new king. I ought to have 
gone then. But I was still curious 
about my chest. 

“The nuse factory had been just 
outside the palace walls. It had 
been razed too — my beautiful in- 



52 



GALAXY 



stallation! — but I could see peo- 
ple working around where it had 
been. I went over to talk to them. 

“When I got up to them, I saw 
they were making bricks. Making 
them by hand, in the dumb, ineffi- 
cient, old-fashioned way. But these 
weren’t rectangular bricks, the way 
the ones before my nuse bricks 
had been. These were rectangular 
on the sides and bottom, but they 
had round tops, like loaves of 
bread.” 

“In other words,” I said, “plano- 
convex bricks.” 

“Yes. It was the most impracti- 
cal idea in the world. Their chang- 
ing to such a silly shape made me 
realize how much the brickmakers 
had hated the nuse bricks. By the 
way — I know how curious you are 
— you’ll be interested to learn that 
walls made with bricks of that kind 
don’t look especially different from 
ordinary walls.” 

64 i~kH,” I said. “I’d been wonder- 
ing about that.” 

“I thought you’d be glad to 
know,” said the nuse man. “Well, I 
went up close to one of the brick- 
makers and watched him working. 
The pace he was going, he’d be 
lucky if he got ten bricks done in 
a day. He smoothed his brick and 
rounded it and patted it. He put 
more mud on it and stood back to 
watch the effect. He pushed a wisp 
of straw into the surface with the 
air of an artist applying a spot of 

THE NUSE MAN 



paint. He just loved that brick. 

“I cleared my throat, but he 
didn’t seem to hear me. I said, ‘Say, 
I heard where they found a chest 
with gold and jewels in the ruins 
of the old palace yesterday.’ 

“ ‘Another one?’ he answered, 
without looking up. ‘You know, 
they found one on the south side of 
the palace about five years ago. Full 
of treasure. Some people have all 
the luck. Me, I never find any- 
thing.’ 

“The south side of the palace 
was where my rooms had been. I 
made a sort of noise. 

“Up to then the worker had been 
too busy patting his round-topped 
brick to pay any attention to me. 
Now he looked up. His eyes got 
wide. His jaw dropped. He stared 
at me. ‘Aren’t you — are you — he 
said doubtfully. 

“Then he made up his mind. 
‘Brothers! Brothers!’ he shouted. 
‘It’s the foreign magician, come 
back to curse us again! Hurry! Kill 
him! Kill him! Kill the stinking 
sheep liver! Quick!’ 

“You wouldn’t have thought that 
people who were working as slow- 
ly as they were could move so 
quick. As soon as they heard the 
words ‘foreign magician,’ they went 
into action, and before he got to 
the second ‘Kill him!’ the sir was 
black with flying bricks.” 

“So that’s how your face—” 

“Y es. Of course, not all the bricks 
were dry. If they had been _ but

even a wet brick can be painful.” 

“And you never got your chest 
back.” 

“No. All I got was the artifacts 
the priest brought me just before 
the nuse levitated him. Would you 
like to see them?” 

He sounded as if he wanted to 
show them to me. I said, “Yes, I’d 
like to.” 

He got out a little box and 
opened it. Inside was a piece of 
lapis lazuli that he said was a whet- 
stone, two crude gold rings with 
roughly cabochon cut blackish 
stones, and a handsome gold neck- 
lace with lapis lazuli beads and 
gold pendants shaped like some 
sort of leaf. 

“Very pretty,” I said, examining 
them. 

“You should have seen the stuff 



I had! But this is better than noth- 
ing. The home office will be glad 
to see it. I don’t usually get even 
this much.” 

' I ’ HIS was true, and he looked so 
A depressed when he said it that 
I felt a burst of sympathy for him. 
I didn’t know what to say. 

He picked up the last piece of 
toast on the plate and looked at it. 

“Burned,” he said sourly, “and 
one of the other slices was, too. 
Listen, why don’t you let me put 
in a nuse installation for you? 
Then your toast would never be 
burned. It’s this housework that’s 
getting you down. You might get 
so you didn’t look any older than 
your real age if you used nuse.” 
“You should live so long,” I said.

ways by the time they got to me. 
I knew them well. 

“Mr. Sol Jones?” 

“That’s right,” I said, watching 
the would-be dragon smuggler be- 
ing marched away. A very amateur 
job. I could have told him. There 
are only two ways to smuggle a 
dragon nowadays. 

“Any livestock to declare, Mr.

FORECAST 

The curtain-raiser for the April Galaxy is a joyous interstellar frolic by 
that young-hearted oldtimer, George O. Smith. Smith has set himself (and 
his bewitched and bewitching characters) a whole constellation of light- 
minded but absolutely urgent problems: the job is the colonization of the 
Universe, and the tactics are . well, the tactics are what you will learn 
when you read THE TROUBLEMAKERS. This one is full novella length and a 
joy from beginning to end. 

The second position in this all-star lineup is a stirring and sharply drawn 
voyage through strangeness by no less brilliant a tale-spinner that Cord- 
wainer Smith. (No relation to George). At novelet length, it packs in more 
solid emotion and dynamic drive than many a full-length book — but then 
that's only to be expected from both the Smiths in the first place, isn't it? 
The title is THE LADY WHO SAILED THE SOUL. You won't forget her!

“I have no livestock on my per- 
son or in my baggage, nor am I ac- 
companied by any material pro- 
hibited article,” I said carefully, 
for I saw they were recording. 

The little pink, bald inspector 
with a charred collar looked at his 
colleague. 

“Anything known?” 

His colleague looked down at me 
from six feet of splendid physique, 
smiled unpleasantly, and flipped 
the big black record book. 

“‘Sol Jones,’” he read. “‘Lama- 
vic four-star offender. Galactic 
registration: six to tenth power: 
763918. Five foot ten inches, Earth 
scale. Blue eyes, hair variable and 
usually nondescript brown, ear 
lobes and cranial . .’ You’re not dis- 
puting identity, Mr. Jones?” 

“Oh, no. That’s me.” 

“I see. ‘Irrevocable Galactic citi- 
zenship for services to family of

of asteroid fungus, subsequent Sen- 
atorial amnesty confirmed, previ- 
ous sentences therefore omitted.

cording turtle, operatic fish, giant 
mastodon.’ Mr. Jones, you seem to 
have given us trouble before.” 
“Before what?” 

56 



“Before this — er— ” 

“That,” I said, “is an Unconsti- 
tutional remark. I am giving no 
trouble. I have made a full declara- 
tion. I demand the rights of a Gal- 
actic citizen.” 

He apologized, as he had to. This 
merely made both inspectors angry, 
but they were going to search me 
anyway. I knew that. Certainly I 
am a smuggler, and I had in fact 
a little present for my girl Florence 
— a wedding present, I hoped — 
but they would never find it. This 
time I really had them fooled, and 
I intended to extract maximum 
pleasure from watching their 
labors. 

SAW the Lamavic records 
once. The next leading offender 
has only two stars and he’s out on 
Ceres in the penal colony. My four 
stars denote that I disapprove of all 
these rules prohibiting the carry- 
ing of livestock from one planet to 
another. Other people extend the 
Galactic Empire; I extend my 
Galactic credit. You want an amus- 
ing extraterrestrial pet to while 
away the two-hour work week, I 
can provide one. Of course, this pet 
business was overdone in the early 
days when any space-hopper could 
bring little foreign monsters back to 
the wife and kiddies. Any weird 
thing could come in and did. 

“You are aware, Mr. Jones, that 
you have declared that you are not 
trying to bring in any prohibited 

GALAXY 



life-form, whether animal, mineral, 
vegetable, or any or all of these?” 
“I am,” I said. 

“You are further aware of the 
penalties for a false declaration?” 
“In my case, I believe I could 
count on thirty years’ invigorating 
work on a penal planet.” 

“You could, Mr. Jones. You cer- 
tainly could.” 

“Well, I’ve made my declara- 
tion.” 

“Will you step this way?” 

Very polite in Philadelphia 
Spaceport. I followed the inspec- 
tors into the screening cubicles. 
There was a nasty looking device 
in the corner. 

“I thought those things were il- 
legal,” I said. 

“Unfortunately, Mr. Jones, you 
are, as you know, quite right. We 
may not employ a telepath instru- 
ment on any unconvicted person.” 
They looked sorry, but I wasn’t. 
A telepath would have told them 
immediately where I had Flor- 
ence’s pet, and all about it. I smiled 
at them. They paid no attention, 
took my passport and began turn- 
ing up the Lamavic manual on An- 
timony IX, Livestock of, Prohib- 
ited Forms. I had just come from 
there and so had Florence’s little 
diver, which I had brought as a hap- 
py surprise. I sat down. The two 
inspectors looked as if they were 
going to say something, then con- 
tinued flipping pages of their 
manual. 

DUMBWAITER 



“Here it is — Antimony IX” 

One of them read out the prohibi- 
tions and the other tried to watch 
me and the reflex counter behind 
me at the same time — a crude in- 
strument which should be used, in 
my professional view, only to de- 
termine a person’s capacities for 
playing poker with success. 

“Ants-water, babblers, bunces, 
candelabra plants, catchem-fel- 
lers, Cythia Majoris, divers, 
dunces, dimple-images, drakes, 
dunking dogs, dogs-savage, dogs- 
water, dogs - not - otherwise - pro - 
vided-for, unspec., elephants-mini- 
ature, fish-any . .” 

They went on. Antimony IX is 
teeming with life and almost every 
specimen is prohibited on other 
planets. We had passed the divers, 
anyway. I smiled and gave the re- 
flex counter a strong jerk just as 
the smaller inspector was saying 
“Mammoths.” They looked at me 
in silence. 

“Funny man,” one said, and they 
went on reading. 

“Okay,” the large inspector said 
at last. “We’ll examine him for 
everything.” 

OR the next three hours, they 
took blood specimens to see if 
I had microscopic livestock hidden 
there, they X-rayed me and my 
baggage, fluoroscoped everything 
again, put the baggage through an 
irritator life-indexer, investigated 
my orifices in detail with a variety 

57 



of instruments, took skin scrapings 
in case I was wearing a false layer, 
and the only thing they found was 
my dark glasses. 

“Why don’t you wear modern 
contact lenses?” 

“It’s none of your business,” I 
said, “but these old-style spectacles 
have liquid lenses.” 

There was a flurry and they sent 
away for analysis a small drop from 
one of the lenses. There were no 
signs of prohibited life in the liquid. 

“I could have told you that,” I 
said. “It’s dicyanin, a vegetable ex- 
tract. Diminishes the glare.” 

I put the glasses on my nose and 
hooked on the earpieces. The ef- 
fect was medieval, but I could see 
the little diver now. I could also see 
disturbing evidence of the inspec- 
tors’ mental condition. A useful lit- 
tle device invented by Dr. W. J. 
Kilner (1847-1920) for the study 
of the human aura in sickness and 
health. After a little practice, which 
I was not going to allow the Lama- 
vic inspectors, the retina became 
sufficiently sensitive to see the 
micro-wave aura when you looked 
through the dicyanin screen. As 
was true of most of these psi pio- 
neers at that time, nothing was 
done to further Kilner’s work when 
he died. I noticed, without surprise, 
that the inspectors had a mental 
field of very limited extent and that 
the little diver had survived the 
journey nicely. 

“Can I go now?” I asked. 



“This time, Mr. Jones.” 

When I left, the repair staff was ; 
building a new inspection barrier to ! 
replace the parts the dragon hadi 
got. Such an amateur performance! j 
Leave smuggling to professionals 
and we’d have Lamavic disbanded 
from boredom in ten years. I near- 
ly slipped on the fine silica dioxide 
which had fused in the air when . 
the dragon got annoyed. Nasty, j 
dangerous pets. 

The one for Florence was the! 
only contraband I was carrying this ! 
trip, which was purely pleasure, j 
She was waiting for me in her 
apartment, tall, golden, luscious, | 
and all mine. She thought I was j 
in import-export, which in a sense i 
was true. 

“I’ve missed you so much, Sol,” 
she said, twining herself on me and 
the couch like a Venusian water- 
nymph. “Did you bring me a pres- 
ent?” 

I lay back and let her kiss me. I 
“Of course I did. A small but 
very valuable present.” 

I let her kiss me again. 

“Not — a Jupiter diamond, Sol?” 
“Much rarer than that, and more 
useful.” 

“Oh. Useful.” 

“Something to help you in the 
house when we’re married, honey. 
Now, don’t pout so prettily, or I’ll 
never get around to showing you.” 
My homecoming was not devel- 
oping quite as I planned, but I put 
this down to womanly, if not exact-

ly maidenly, quirks. When she 
found out what I had brought her, 
I was sure she would be all over 
me again. I put on my dark glasses 
so that I could see where the diver 
was. 

“Would you like a drink, 
honey?” I asked. 

“I don’t mind,” she said sulkily. 

T LOOKED at the diver, concen- 
-*• trated hard on the thought of 
a bottle from the cabinet, two 
glasses and a pitcher of ice from 
the kitchen. He went revolving 
through the air obediently and the 
items came floating out neatly. 
Florence nearly shattered the win- 
dows with her screams. 

“Now calm down, honey,” I said, 
catching her. “Calm down. It’s just 
a little present I brought you.” 

The bottle, glasses and pitcher 
dropped gently onto the table be- 
side us. 

“See?” I said. “Service at a 
thought. Remote control. The end 
of housework. Kiss me.” 

She didn’t. 

“You mean you did that, Sol?” 
“Not me, exactly. I’ve brought 
you a little baby diver, honey, all 
the way from Antimony IX, just for 
you. There isn’t another one on 
Earth. In fact, I doubt if there’s an- 
other one outside Antimony IX. I 
had a lot of trouble securing this 
rare and valuable present for you.” 
“I don’t like it. It gives me the 
creeps.” 

60 



“Honey,” I said carefully, “this 
is a little baby. It couldn’t hurt a 
mouse. It’s about six inches in diam- 
eter, and all it is doing is to tele- 
port what you want it to teleport.” 
“Then why can’t I see it?” 

“If you could see it, I wouldn’t 
have been allowed to bring it for 
you, honey, because a whole row of 
nasty-minded Solar Civil Servants 
would have seen it too, and they 
would have taken it from your own 
sweet Sol.” 

“They can have it.” 

“Honey, this is a rare and valu- 
able pet! It will do things for you.” 
“So you think I need something 
done for me. Well! I’m glad you 
came right out and said this before 
we were married!” 

The following series of “but — 
but—” from me and irrelevance 
from Florence occupied an hour, 
but hardly mentioned the diver. 
Eventually I got her back into my 
arms. 

My urges for Florence were 
strictly biological, though intense. 
There were little chances for intel- 
lectual exchanges between us, but 
I was more interested in the broad 
probabilities of her as a woman. 
I could go commune with wild and 
exotic intelligences on foreign plan- 
ets any time I had the fare. As a 
woman, Florence was what I 
wanted. 

“Back on Antimony IX,” I ex- 
plained carefully, “life is fierce and 
rugged. So, to keep from being

eaten, these little divers evolved 
themselves into little minds with 
no bodies at all, and they feed off 
solar radiation. Now, honey, minds 
are not made of the same stuff 
brains are made of, good solid tis- 
sue and gray matter and neural 
cortex—” 

“Don’t be dirty, Sol.” 

“There is nothing dirty about the 
body, honey. Minds are invisible 
but detectable in the micro-wave- 
lengths on any sensitive counter, 
and look like little glass eggs when 
you can see them— as I can, by us- 
ing these glasses. In fact, your diver 
is over by the window now. But, 
having evolved this far, they 
came across a little difficulty and 
couldn’t evolve any further. So 
there they are, handy little minds 
for teleporting whatever you want 
moved, and reading other people’s 
thoughts.” 

S HE gasped. “Did you say read- 
ing other people’s thoughts? 
“Certainly,” I said. “As a matter 
of fact, that’s what stopped the 
divers from evolving further. If 
they brush against any thinking 
creature, they pick up whatever 
thought is in the creature’s con- 
scious mind. But they also pick up 
the subliminal activity, if you fol- 
low me — and down at that level 
of a mind such as man’s, his 
thoughts are not only the present 
unconscious thoughts but also a 
good slice of what is to him still the 
DUMBWAITER 



future. It’s one of those space-time 
differences. The divers are not real- 
ly on the same space-time refer- 
ence as the physical world, but that 
makes them all the more useful, be- 
cause our minds aren’t either.” 
“Did you say reading other peo- 
ple’s thoughts, like a telepath?” she 
persisted. 

“Exactly like a telepath, or any 
other class of psi. We’re really liv- 
ing on a much wider scale than 
we’re conscious of, but our mind 
only tracks down one point in 
time-space in a straight line, which 
happens to fit our bodies. Our sub- 
liminal mind is way out in every 
direction, including time — and 
when you pick up fragments of 
this consciously, you’re a psi, that’s 
all. So the divers got thoroughly 
confused— that’s what it amounts 
to— and never evolved any further. 
So you see, honey, it’s all perfectly 
natural.” 

“I think you’re just dirty.” 
“Eh?” 

“Everyone hates telepaths. You 
know that.” 

“I don’t.” 

“Oh, you go wandering all over 
the Galaxy — but my friends — 
what could I say to my friends if 
they learned I had something like 
a telepath in the apartment?” 

“It’s only a baby diver, I keep 
telling you, honey. And anyway, 
you’ll be able to tell what they’re 
really thinking about you.” 

Florence looked thoughtful.

A plump little man, leaning back 
in a chair by the door, got slowly 
up, looking Pulcher over. 

“In back,” he said shortly. 

He led Pulcher behind the store, 
to a three-room apartment. The liv- 
ing room was comfortable enough, 
but for some reason it seemed un- 
balanced. One side was somehow 
heavier than the other. Pulcher no- 
ticed the nap of the rug, still flat- 
tened out where something heavy 
had been, something rectangular 
and large, about the size of a Tri-V 
electronic entertainment unit 

“Repossessed,” said Lasser. “Sit 
down. Dickon called you a minute 
ago.” 

“Oh?” It had to be something im- 
portant. Dickon wouldn’t have 
tracked him down for any trivial 
matter. 

“Don’t know what he wanted, 
but he said you weren’t to leave 
till he called back. Sit down. May’ll 
bring you a cup of tea.” 

Pulcher chatted while the wom- 
an fussed over a teapot and a plate 
of soft cookies. He was trying to get 
the feel of the home. He could un- 
derstand Madeleine Gaultry’s des- 
peration. He could understand the 
Foltis boy, a misfit in any society 
anywhere. What about Jimmy Las- 
ser? 

The elder Lassers were both 
pushing sixty. They were first-gen- 
eration Niners, off an Earth colon- 
izing ship. They hadn’t been bom 
on Earth, of course — the trip took 



nearly a hundred years, physical ! 
transport. They had been born in I 
transit, had married on the ship. As 
the ship had reached maximum 
population level shortly after they 
were born, they were allowed to 
have no children until they landed. 
At that time they were about forty. 

May Lasser said suddenly; 
“Please help our boy, Mr. Pulcher! 

It isn’t Jimmy’s fault. He got in 
with a bad crowd. You know how 
it is, no work, nothing for a boy to 
do.” 

“I’ll do my best.” 

T>UT it was funny, Pulcher 
thought, how it was always 
“the crowd” that was bad. It was 
never Jimmy — and never Avery, 
never Sam, never Walter. 

Pulcher sorted out the five boys 
and remembered Jimmy: nine- 
teen years old, quite colorless, po- 
lite, not very interested. What had 
struck the lawyer about him was 
only surprise that this rabbity boy 
should have the enterprise to get 
into a criminal conspiracy in the 
first place. 

“He’s a good boy,” said May Las- 
ser pathetically. “That trouble with 
the parked cars two years ago 
wasn’t his fault. He got a fine job 
right after that, you know. Ask his 
probation officer. Then the Icicle 
Works closed—” She poured more 
tea, slopping it over the side of the 
cup. “Oh, sorry! But — but when he 
went to the unemployment office 



Mr. Pulcher, do you know what 
they said to him?” 

“I know,” said Pulcher. 

‘They asked him would he take 
a job if offered,” she hurried on, un- 
heeding. “A job. As if I didn’t know 
what they meant by a job! They 
meant renting!” She plumped the 
teapot down on the table and be- 
gan to weep. “Mr. Pulcher, I 
wouldn’t let him rent if I died for 
it! There isn’t anything in the Bible 
that says you can let someone else 
use your body and not be respon- 
sible for what it does! You know 
what tourists do! ‘If thy right hand 
offend thee, cut it off.’ It doesn’t 
say, ‘Unless somebody else is us- 
ing it.’ Mr. Pulcher, renting is a 
sin!” 

“May.” Mr. Lasser put his tea- 
cup down and looked directly at 
Pulcher. “What about it? Can you 
get Jimmy off?” 

The attorney reflected. He 
hadn’t known about Jimmy Las- 
ser’s probation before. If the coun- 
ty prosecutor was holding out on 
information of that sort, it meant 
he wasn’t willing to cooperate. 
Probably he would be trying for a 
conviction with maximum sen- 
tence. Of course, he didn’t have to 
tell a defense attorney anything 
about the previous criminal records 
of his clients. But in a juvenile case, 
where all parties were usually will- 
ing to go easy on the defendants, 
it was customary . 

“I don’t know, Mr. Lasser,” Pul- 



cher said. “I’ll do the best I can.” 
“Damn right you will!” barked 
Lasser. “Dickon tell you who I am? 
I was committeeman here before 
him, you know. So get busy. Pull 
strings. Dickon will back you or 
I’ll know why!” 

Pulcher managed to control him- 
self. “I’ll do the best I can. I already 
told you that. If you want strings 
pulled, you’d better talk to Dickon 
yourself. I only know law. I don’t 
know anything about politics.” 

The atmosphere was becoming 
unpleasant. Pulcher was glad to 
hear the’ ringing of the phone in the 
store outside. May Lasser answered 
it and said: “For you, Mr. Pulcher. 
Charley Dickon.” 

Pulcher gratefully picked up the 
phone. Dickon’s rich, political 
voice said sorrowfully: “Milo? 

Listen, I been talking to Judge 
Pegrim’s secretary. He isn’t gonna 
let the kids off with a slap on the 
wrist. There’s a lot of heat from the 
mayor’s office.” 

TJULCHER protested desperate- 
ly: “But the Swinburne kid 
wasn’t hurt! He got better care with 
Madeleine than he was getting at 
home.” 

“I know, Milo,” the committee- 
man agreed, “but that’s the way it 
is. So what I wanted to say to you, 
Milo, is don’t knock yourself out 
on this one, because you aren’t go- 
ing to win it.” 

“But—” Pulcher suddenly be-

“And what they’ve been doing?” 
“Sometimes they will do what 
they think they’ll do. And some- 
times they don’t make it But it’s 
what their subliminal plans to have 
happen, yes.” 

She kissed me. “I think it’s a 
lovely present Sol.” 

She snuggled up to me and I con- 
centrated on bringing the diver 
over to her. I thought I’d read her, 
just for a joke, and see what she 
had in mind. I took a close look. 
“What’s the matter, Sol?” 

“Oh, honey! You beautiful crea- 
ture!” 

“This is nice — but what made 
you say that?” 

“I just got the diver to show me 
your mind, and bits of the next two 
weeks you have in mind. It’s go- 
ing to be a lovely, lovely vacation.” 
She blushed very violently and 
got angry. “You had no right to 
look at what I was thinking, Sol!” 
“It wasn’t what you were think- 
ing so much as what you will be 
thinking, honey. I figure in it quite 
well.” 

“I won’t have it, Sol! Do you 
hear me? I think spying on people 
is detestable!” 

“I thought you liked the idea of 
tagging your friends?” 

“That’s different. Either we go 
somewhere without that whatever- 
it-is, or you can marry someone 
else. I don’t mind having it around 
after we’re married, but not before, 
Sol. Do you understand?”

I was already reaching for the 
video yellow pages. 

T TURNED on the television- 
wall in the apartment before we 
left and instructed the diver to stay 
around and watch it. They are very 
curious creatures, inquisitive, al- 
ways chasing new ideas, and I 
thought that should hold the diver 
happily for several days. Mean- 
while, I had booked adjoining 
rooms at the Asteroid-Central. 

The Asteroid-Central advertised 
in the video yellow pages that it 
practiced the Most Rigid Discrimi- 
nation-meaning no telepaths, clair- 
voyants, clairaudients or psycho- 
metrists. Life was hard on a psi 
outside Government circles. But 
life was much harder on the rest of 
the world seeking secluded privacy 
and discretion. The Asteroid-Cen- 
tral was so discreet, you could 
hardly see where you were going. 
Dim lights, elegant figures passing 
in the gloom, singing perfumes of 
the gentlest kind, and “Guaranteed 
Psi-Free” on every bedroom door. 

I was humming idly in my room, 
with one eye on the communicat- 
ing door through which, were she 
but true to her own mind, Florence 
would shortly come, and I turned 
on the television-wall only to see 
how less fortunate people were 
spending their leisure. An idle and 
most regrettable gesture. 

There was a quiz-game on Inter- 
national Channel 462, dull and 
GALAXY 



just finishing. All the contestants 
seemed to know all the answers. In 
fact, the man who won the trip 
around the Rings of Saturn, did 
so by answering the question be- 
fore the Martian quiz-master had 
really finished reading it out. When 
the winner turned sharply on the 
other contestants and knocked 
them down, yelling, “So that’s what 
you think of my mother, is it?” the 
wall was blacked out and we were 
taken straight to the Solar Party 
Convention. 

The nominee this decade was hu- 
man. He seemed to be speaking on 
his aims, his pure record and altru- 
istic intentions. The stereo cameras 
looked over the heads of the dele- 
gates. Starting in the row by the 
main aisle, each delegate shot to 
his feet and started booing and 
jeering. It rippled down' the rows 
like a falling pack of cards, each 
delegate in turn after the man in 
front of him, and each row picking 
up where the back of the previous 
row left off. It was as if someone 
were passing a galvanizing brush 
along the heads of the delegates, 
"■■w bv row. 

X V_» T . __ 

Or as if a divef refreshing 
the delegates with a clear pictlLT e 
of their nominee’s mind. 

I groaned and called Florence. 

“Look,” I said when she came. 
“That damned pet has followed the 
program back to the cameras from 
your apartment, and there he is 
lousing up the Convention.” 
DUMBWAITER 



“I vote Earth,” she told me indif- 
ferently. 

“That isn’t the point, honey. I’ll 
have to bring the diver here, and 
quickly.” 

“You do that, Sol. I’ll be at home 
when you get rid of it.” 

By the time the diver picked up 
my thoughts and came flickering 
into the room through the walls, 
Florence had left. 

I felt the diver off the back of 
my head, made my thoughts as 
kindly as possible, and went down- 
stairs to the largest, longest bar. 

T^HE evening passed profitably 
because I was invited to join 
a threesome of crooks at cards. 
With the aid of the little diver, I 
was able to shorten the odds to a 
pleasant margin in my favor. But 
this was doing nothing about Flor- 
ence. A not altogether funny re- 
mark about teleporting the cards 
did, however, suggest the answer. 

After the transaction was over, 
I sent the diver off to a friend on 
the faculty of Luke University, 
where they had a long history of 
psi investigation and where the 
diver could be guaranteed to be 
kept busy rolling dice and such. 

was easy to fix by a video call. 
There had been !i mes ^ the past 
when certain services to the 
terrestrial Zoology and Botanical 
Tanks had made me discreetly pop- 
ular with the faculty, and anyway 
they thought I was doing them a 

63 



favor. They promised to keep the 
little diver busy for an indefinite 
period. 

I reported to Florence, and after 
a certain amount of feminine shall- 
I-shan’t-I, she came back to the As- 
teroid-Central. 

This time I did not turn on the 
television-wall. I lay still. I said 
nothing. I hardly thought at all. 
And after several years compressed 
themselves into every minute, my 
own true honey, Florence, slid 
open the communicating door and 
came into the room. 

She walked shyly toward me, 
hiding modestly within a floating 
nightgown as opaque as a very clear 
soap bubble. 

I stood up, held out my arms and 
she came toward me, smiling — 
and stopped to pick up something 
on the carpet 

“Ooo, Sol! Look! A Jupiter dia- 
mond!” 

She held up the largest and most 
expensive diamond I have ever 
seen. 

I was just going to claim credit 
for this little gift when another ap- 
peared, and another, and a long 
line marching over the carpet like 
an ant trail. They came floating in 
under the door. 

No w^ love is for '"cations, and 

betwee*- m y Qwn sweet Fi orenC e 

and a diamond mine there is no 
comparison. I put on my dicyanin 
glasses and saw the baby diver was 
back and at work teleporting. I said 

64 



so, but this time there were^ no 
hysterics from Florence. 

“I was just thinking of him,” she 
said, “and wishing you had brought 
me a Jupiter diamond instead.” 

‘Well, honey, it looks as if you’ve 
got both.” 

I watched her scrambling on the 
carpet, gathering handfuls of dia- 
monds and not in the least inter- 
ested in me. 

On Antimony IX, the little 
divers switched from one space- 
time point to another simultaneous- 
ly, and the baby diver had come 
back from the Solar Party Conven- 
tion the same way. I thought of it 
and it came; Florence had just 
thought of it and here it was. But 
now it seemed to be flitting lightly 
from Earth to Jupiter and back 
with diamonds, so perhaps there 
was no interplanetary distance to 
a mind. 

This had a future. I could see 
myself with a winter and a summer 
planet of my own, even happily 
paying Earth, Solar and Galactic 
taxes. 

“Well, honey, don’t you worry,” 
I said. “You don’t like divers, so 
I’ll take it back and you some _ 
thinv '’ ise j us t leave it to Sol.” 

“Take your foot off that dia- 
mond, Sol Jones! You gave me this 
dear little diver and he’s mine!” 

CHE sat back on her heels and 
^ thought. The evidence of her 
thinking immediately came trick- 

GALAXY 



ling through the door — Venusian 
opals set in a gold bracelet half a 
pound heavy, Martian sleeze furs, 
spider-web stockings, platinum 
belts. The room was beginning to 
look like a video fashion center, a 
Galactic merchandise mart. And 
after Florence put on a coat and 
opened the door, her ideas began 
to get bigger. 

“This is fun!” she cried, teleport- 
ing like mad. “Why, I can have any- 
thing in the Galaxy just by think- 
ing about it!” 

“Now, honey, think of the bene- 
fits to humanity! This is too big to 
be used for personal gain. This 
should be dedicated—” 

“This is dedicated to me, Sol 
Jones, so just you keep your fin- 
gers off it. Why, the cute little 
thing — look, he’s been out to Sat- 
urn for me!” 

I made a decision. Think wide 
and grand, Sol Jones, I said. Sac- 
rifice yourself for the greater good. 

“Florence, honey, you knojv I 
love you. Will you marry me?” 

That stopped her. “You mean 
it, Sol?” 

“Of course.” 

“It’s not just because of this 
diver?” 

‘Why, honey, how could you 
think such a thing? If I’d never 
brought it in for you. I’d still want 
to marry you.” 

“You never said so before,” she 
said. “But okay. If you do it now. 
Right now, Sol Jones.” 
DUMBWAITER 



So the merchandise stopped 
coming in while we plugged into 
the video and participated in a 
moving and legal ceremony. The 
marriage service was expensive, but 
after all we could teleport in a few 
thousand credit blanks from the 
Solar Treasury. Immediately after 
we had switched off, we did so. 

. “Are you sure you married me 
for myself, Sol?” 

“I swear it, honey. No other 
thought entered my head. Just 
you.” 

1 made a few notes while Flor- 
ence planned the house we would 
have, furnished with rare materials 
from anywhere. I thought one of 
the medium asteroids would do for 
a base for Sol Jones Intragalactic 
Transport. I could see it all, vast 
warehouses and immediate deliv- 
ery of anything from anywhere. I 
wondered if there was a limit to the 
diver’s capacity, so Florence de- 
sired an encyclopedia and in it 
came, floating through the doorway. 

“It says,” she-read, “not much is 
known about Antimony IX divers 
because none have ever been 
known to leave their planet.” 
“They probably need the stimu- 
lus of an educated mind,” I said. 
“Anyway, this one can get dia- 
monds from Jupiter and so on, and 
that’s what matters.” 

¥ KISSED the wife of the Presi- 
dent of Sol Jones Intragalactic 
and was interrupted by discreet 

65 



tapping on the door. The manager 
of the Asteroid-Central beamed at 
us. 

“Excuse,” he said. “But we un- 
derstand you have just been mar- 
ried, Mr. and Mrs. Jones.” 
“Irrevocably,” I said. 
“Felicitations. The Asteroid- 
Central will be sending up compli- 
mentary euphorics. There is just a 
small point, Mr. Jones. We notice 
you have a large selection of valu- 
able gifts for the bride.” 

He looked round the room and 
smiled at the piles of stuff Florence 
had thought of. 

“Of course,” he went on, “we 
trust your stay will be pleasant and 
perhaps you will let us know if you 
will be wanting anything else.” 

“I expect we will, but we’ll let 
you know,” I said. 

“Thank you, Mr. Jones. It is 
merely that we noticed you had 



emptied every showcase on the 
ground floor and, a few moments 
ago, teleported the credit contents 
of the bar up here. Not of impor- 
tance, really; it is all charged on 
your bill.” 

“You saw it and didn’t stop it?” 
I yelled. 

“Oh, no, Mr. Jones. We always 
make an exception for Antimony 
IX divers. Limited creatures, real- 
ly, but good for our business. We 
get about one a month — smuggled 
in, you know. But the upkeep 
proves too expensive. Some women 
do shop without more than a pass- 
ing thought, don’t they?” 

I saw what he meant, but Mrs. 
Sol Jones took it very philosophi- 
cally. 

“Never mind, Sol — you have 
me.” 

“Or vice versa, honey,” I said.

T HE wind was cold, pink 
snow was falling, and Milo 
Pulcher had holes in his 
shoes. He trudged through the pink- 
grey slush across the square from 
the courthouse to the jail. 

THE DAY THE ICICLE WORI 



Illustrated by DILLON 

The turnkey was drinking cof- 
fee out of a vinyl container. “Ex- 
pecting you,” he grunted. “Which 
one you want to see first?” 

Pulcher sat down, grateful for 
the warmth. “It doesn’t matter. Say, 
what kind of kids are they?” 

The turnkey shrugged. 

S CLOSED

“I mean, do they give you any 
trouble?” 

“How could they give me 
trouble? If they don’t clean their 
cells, they don’t eat. What else they 
do makes no difference to me. 
Which one you want to see?” 

Pulcher took the letter from 
Judge Pegrim out of his pocket and 
examined the list of his new clients. 
Avery Foltis, Walter Hopgood, 
Jimmy Lasser, Sam Schlesterman, 
Bourke Smith, Madeleine Gaultry. 
None of the names meant anything 
to him. 

“I’ll take Foltis first,” he guessed, 
and followed the turnkey to a cell. 

The Foltis boy was homely, pim- 
ply and belligerent. “Cripes,” he 
complained shrilly, “are you the 
best they can do for me?” 

Pulcher took his time answering. 
The boy was not very lovable; but, 
he reminded himself, there was a 
fifty-dollar retainer from the coun- 
ty for each one of these defend- 
ants, and conditions being what 
they were, Pulcher could easily 
grow to love three hundred dollars. 

“Don’t give me a hard time,” he 
said amiably. “I may not be the 
best lawyer in the Galaxy, but I’m 
the one you’ve got.” 

“Cripes.” 

“Tell me what happened. All I 
know is that you’re accused of con- 
spiracy to commit a felony, specifi- 
cally an act of kidnapping a minor 
child.” 

“Yeah, that’s it,” the boy agreed. 



“You want to know what hap- 
pened?” He bounced to his feet, 
then began acting out his story. 
“We were starving to death, see?” 
Arms clutched pathetically around 
his belly. “The Icicle Works closed 
down. Cripes, I walked the streets 
nearly a year, looking for some- 
thing to do. Anything.” Marching 
in place. “I even rented out for a 
while, but — that didn’t work out.” 
Scowling and fingering his pimply 
face. 

Pulcher nodded. Even a body- 
renter had to have some qualifica- 
tions. The most important one was 
a good-looking, disease-free, strong 
and agile physique. 

“So we got together and decided, 
the hell, there was money to be 
made hooking old Swinburne’s son. 
So I guess we talked too much. 
They caught us.” The boy gripped 
his wrists, like manacles. 

Pulcher asked a few more ques- 
tions, and then interviewed two of 
the other boys. He learned nothing 
he hadn’t already known. The six 
youngsters had planned a reason- 
ably competent kidnapping, and 
talked about it where they could 
be heard, and if there was any hope 
of getting them off, it did not make 
itself visible to their court-ap- 
pointed attorney. 

T> ULCHER left the jail and went 
up Ihe street to see Charley 
Dickon. 

The committeeman was watch- 
GALAXY 



ing a three-way wrestling match on 
a flickery old TV set. 

“How’d it go, Milo?” he greeted 
the lawyer, keeping his eyes on the 
wrestling. 

Pulcher said: “I’m not going to 
get them off, Charley.” 

“Oh? Too bad.” Dickon looked 
away from the set for the first time. 
“Why not?” 

“They admitted the whole thing. 
Handwriting made the Hopgood 
boy on the ransom note. The others 
had fingerprints and cell-types all 
over the place. And besides, they 
talked too much.” 

Dickon said with a spark of in- 
terest: ‘What about Tim Lasser’s 
son?” 

“Sorry.” 

The committeeman looked 
thoughtful. 

“I can’t help it, Charley,” the law- 
yer protested. 

The kids hadn’t been even rou- 
tinely careful. When they planned 
to kidnap the son of the mayor, 
they had talked it over, quite loud- 
ly, in a juke joint. The waitress 
habitually taped everything that 
went on in her booths. Pulcher sus- 
pected a thriving blackmail busi- 
ness, but that didn’t change the fact 
that there was enough on tape to 
show premeditation. 

The kids had picked the mayor’s 
son up at school. He had come with 
them perfectly willingly — the girl, 
Madeleine Gaultry, had been a 
babysitter for him. The boy was 



only three years old, but he couldn’t 
miss an easy identification like that 
And there was more: the ransom 
note had been sent special delivery, 
and young Foltis had asked the 
post office clerk to put the postage 
on instead of using the automatic 
meter. The clerk remembered the 
pimply face very well indeed. 

“You’d think they wanted to get 
caught,” Pulcher complained. 

The committeeman sat politely 
while Pulcher explained, though it 
was obvious that most of his atten- 
tion was on the snowy TV screen. 
“Well, Milo, that’s the way it goes. 
Anyway, you got a fast three hun- 
dred, hey? And that reminds me.” 

Pulcher’s guard went up. 

“Here,” said the committeeman, 
rummaging through his desk. He 
brought out a couple of pale green 
tickets. “You ought to get out and 
meet more people. The Party’s 
having its annual Chester A. Arthur 
Day Dinner next week. Bring your 
girl.” 

“I don’t have a girl,” said Pul- 
cher. 

"Oh, you’ll find one. Fifteen dol- 
lars per,” the committeeman said, 
handing over the tickets. 

Pulcher sighed and paid. Well, 
that was what kept the wheels oiled. 
And Dickon had suggested his 
name to Judge Pegrim. Thirty dol- 
lars out of three hundred still left 
him a better week’s pay than he 
had had since the Icicle Works 
folded. 



THE DAY THE ICICLE WORKS CLOSED 



70 



71 



The committeeman carefully 
folded the bills into his pocket, with 
Pulcher watching gloomily. Dickon 
was looking prosperous, all right. 
There was easily a couple of thou- 
sand in that wad. Pulcher supposed 
that Dickon had been caught along 
with everybody else on the planet 
when the Icicle Works folded. 
Nearly everybody owned stock in 
it, and certainly Charley Dickon, 
whose politician brain got him a 
piece of nearly every major enter- 
prise on Altair Nine — a big clump 
of stock in the Tourist Agency, a 
sizable share of the Mining Syndi- 
cate — certainly he would have had 
at least a few thousand in the Icicle 
Works. But it hadn’t hurt him 
much. 

Dickon said, “None of my busi- 
ness, but why don’t you take that 
girl — that Madeleine Gaultry?” 

“She’s in jail.” 

“Get her out. Here.” He tossed 
over a bondsman’s card. 

Pulcher pocketed it with a scowl. 
That would cost another forty 
bucks, he estimated; the bondsman 
would naturally be one of Dickon’s 
club members. 

Pulcher noticed that Dickon was 
looking strangely puzzled. “What’s 
the matter?” 

“Like I say, it’s none of my busi- 
ness. But I don’t get it. You and the 
girl have a fight?” 

“Fight? I don’t even know her.” 

“She said you did.” 

“Me? No. I don’t know . Wait 



a minute! Is Gaultry her married 
name? Did she used to be at the 
Icicle Works?” 

Dickon nodded. “Didn’t you see 
her?” 

“I didn’t get to the women’s wing 
at the jail. I—” Pulcher stood up, 
oddly flustered. “Say, I’d better run 
along, Charley. This bondsman, he’s 
open now? Well — ” He stopped 
babbling and left. 

Madeleine Gaultry! Only her 
name had been Madeleine Cossett. 
It was funny that she should turn 
up now — in jail and, Pulcher ab- 
ruptly realized, likely to stay there 
indefinitely. But he put that 
thought out of his mind. First he 
wanted to see her. 

T HE snow.was turning lavender 
now. Pink snow, green snow, 
lavender snow — any color of the 
pastel rainbow. It was nothing un- 
usual. That was what had made 
Altair Nine worth colonizing in the 
first place. 

Now, of course, it was only a way 
of getting your feet wet. 

Pulcher waited impatiently at 
the turnkey’s office while the turn- 
key shambled over to the women’s 
wing and, slowly, returned with the 
girl. She and Pulcher looked at 
each other. She didn’t speak. Pul- 
cher opened his mouth, closed it, 
and silently took her by the elbow. 
He steered her out of the jail and 
hailed a cab. That was an extrava- 
gance, but he didn’t care. 

GALAXY 



Madeleine shrank into a corner 
of the cab, looking at him out of 
blue eyes that were large and shad- 
owed. She wasn’t hostile. She 
wasn’t afraid. She was only remote. 

“Hungry?” 

She nodded. 

Pulcher gave the cab driver the 
name of a restaurant. Another ex- 
travagance, but he didn’t mind the 
prospect of cutting down on 
lunches. He had had enough prac- 
tice at it. 

A year before, this girl had been 
the prettiest secretary in the pool 
at the Icicle Works. He dated her 
half a dozen times. There was a 
company rule against it, but the 
first time it was a kind of school- 
boy’s prank, breaking the headmas- 
ter’s regulations, and the other 
times it was a driving need. Then- 

Then came the Gumpert Process. 

That was the killer, the Gum- 
pert Process. Whoever Gumpert 
was. All anybody at the Icicle 
Works knew was that someone 
named Gumpert (back on Earth, 
one rumor said; another said he 
was a colonist in the Sirian system) 
had come up with a cheap, practi- 
cal method of synthesizing the rain- 
bow antibiotic molds that floated 
free in Altair Nine’s air, coloring 
its precipitation and more impor- 
tant, providing a priceless export 
commodity. The Galaxy had de- 
pended on those rainbow molds, 
shipped in frozen suspensions to 
every inhabited planet by Altamy- 
THE DAY THE ICICLE WORK 




cin, Inc. — the proper name for 
what everyone on Altair Nine 
called the Icicle Works. 

When the Gumpert Process 
came along, suddenly the demand 
vanished. 

Worse, the jobs vanished. 

Pulcher had been on the corpora- 
tion’s legal staff, with an office of 
his own and a faint hint of a vice- 
presidency someday. He was out. 
The stenos in the pool, all but two 
or three of the five hundred who 
once had handled the correspon- 
dence and the bills, they were out. 
The shipping clerks in the ware- 
house were out, the pumphands at 
the settling tanks were out, the 
freezer attendants were out. Every- 
one was out. The plant closed 
down. 

There were more than fifty tons 
of frozen antibiotics in storage and, 
though there might still be a faint 
trickle of orders from old-fashioned 
diehards around the Galaxy (back- 
woods country doctors who didn’t 
believe in the new-fangled syn- 
thetics, experimenters who wanted 
to run comparative tests), the ship- 
ments already en route would 
much more than satisfy them. 

Fifty tons? Once the Icicle 
Works had shipped three hundred 
tons a day — physical transport, 
electronic rockets that took years 
to cover the distance between stars. 
The boom was over. And of course, 
on a one-industry planet, every- 
thing else was over too. 

S CLOSED

Pulcher took the girl by the arm 
and swept her into the restaurant. 

“Eat,” he ordered. “I know what 
jail food is like.” 

He sat down, firmly determined 
to say nothing until she had fin- 
ished. 

OUT he couldn’t. Long before 
she was ready for coffee, he 
burst out: “Why, Madeleine? Why 
would you get into something like 
this?” 

She looked at him but did not 
answer. 

“What about your husband?” 
Pulcher didn’t want to ask it, but 
he had to. That had been the big- 
gest of all the unpleasant blows that 
had struck him after the Icicle 
Works closed. Just as he was get- 
ting a law practice going — not on 
any big scale but, through Charley 
Dickon and the Party, a small, 
steady handout of political favors 
that would make it possible for him 
to pretend he was still an attorney 
--the gossip reached him that Mad- 
eleine Cossett had married. 

The girl pushed her plate away. 
“He emigrated.” 

Pulcher digested that slowly. 
Emigrated? That was the dream of 
every Niner since the Works closed 
down. But it was only a dream. 
Physical transport between the 
stars was ungodly expensive. More, 
it was ungodly slow. Ten years 
would get you to Dell, the thin- 
aired planet of a chilly little red 



dwarf. The nearest good planet was 
thirty years away. 

What it all added up to was that 
emigrating was almost like dying. 
If one member of a married couple 
emigrated, it meant the end of the 
marriage. 

“We got a divorce,” said Made- 
leine, nodding. “There wasn’t 
enough money for both of us to go, 
and Jon was unhappier here than 
I was.” 

She took out a cigarette and let 
him light it “You don’t want to 
ask me about Jon, do you? But you 
want to know. All right. Jon was an 
artist. He was in the advertising de- 
partment at the Works, but that 
was just temporary. He was going 
to do something big. Then the bot- 
tom dropped out for him, just as it 
did for all of us. Well, Milo, I didn’t 
hear from you.” 

Pulcher protested: “It wouldn’t 
have been fair for me to see you 
when I didn’t have a job or any- 
thing.” 

“Of course you’d think that. But 
I couldn’t find you to tell you it was 
wrong, and then Jon was very per- 
sistent. He was tall, curly-haired, he 
had a baby’s face — do you know, 
he only shaved twice a week! Well, 
I married him. It lasted three 
months. Then he just had to get 
away.” 

She leaned forward earnestly. 
“Don’t think he was just a bum, 
Milo! He really was quite a good 
artist. But we didn’t have enough 



money for paints, even, and then it 
seems that the colors are all wrong 
here. Jon explained it. In order to 
paint landscapes that sell, you have 
to be on a planet with Earth-type 
colors. They’re all the vogue. And 
there’s too much altamycin in the 
clouds here.” 

Pulcher said stiffly, “I see.” But 
he didn’t, really. There was at least 
one unexplained part If there 
hadn’t been enough money for 
paint, then where had the money 
come from for a starship ticket, 
physical transport? It meant at 
least ten thousand dollars. There 
just was no way to raise ten thou- 
sand dollars on Altair Nine, not 
without taking a rather extreme 
step . 

The girl wasn’t looking at him 

Her eyes were fixed on a table 
across the restaurant, a table with 
a loud, drunken party. It was only 
lunch time, but they had a three- 
o’clock-in-the-morning air about 
them. They were stinking. There 
were four of them, two men and 
two women, and their physical 
bodies were those of young, 
healthy, quite goodlooking, perfect- 
ly normal Niners. The appearance 
of the physical bodies was entirely 
irrelevant, though, because they 
were tourists. Around the neck of 
each of them was a bright golden 
choker with a glowing red signal- 
jewel in the middle — the mark of 
the Tourist Agency - the sign that 
the bodies were rented. 



Milo Pulcher looked away 
quickly. His eyes stopped on the 
white face of the girl, and now he 
knew how she had raised the money 
to send Jon to another world. 

II 

T^ULCHER found the girl a 
A room and left her there, though 
that was not what he wanted. What 
he wanted was to spend the even- 
ing with her and to go on spending 
time with her, until time came to an 
end. But there was the matter of 
her trial. 

Twenty-four hours ago he had 
got the letter notifying him that the 
court had appointed him attorney 
for six suspected kidnappers and 
looked on it as a fast fee, no work 
to speak of, no hope for success. He 
would lose the case, certainly. Well, 
what of it? 

But now he wanted to win! 

It meant some fast, hard work if 
he was to have even a chance — 
and at best, he admitted to him- 
self, the chance would not be good. 
Still, he wasn’t going to give up 
without a try. 

The snow stopped as he located 
the home of Jimmy Lasser’s par- 
ents. It was a sporting goods shop, 
not far from the main Tourist 
Agency; it had a window full of 
guns and boots and scuba gear. He 
walked in, tinkling a bell as he 
opened the door. 

“Mr. Lasser?”

came aware of the Lassers just be- 
hind him. “But I think I can get an 
acquittal,” he said, entirely out of 
hope, knowing that it wasn’t true. 

Dickon chuckled. “You got Las- 
ser breathing down your neck? 
Sure, Milo. But you want my ad- 
vice, you’ll take a quick hearing, 
let them get sentenced and then 
try for executive clemency in a 
couple months. I’ll help you get it. 
And that’s another five hundred or 
so for you, see?” 

The committeeman was being 
persuasive; it was a habit of his. 
“Don’t worry about Lasser. I guess 
he’s been telling you what a power 
he is in politics here. Forget it And, 
say, tell him I notice he hasn’t got 
his tickets for the Chester A. Ar- 
thur Day Dinner yet. You pick up 
the dough from him, will you? I’ll 
mail him the tickets. No — hold 
on, don’t ask him. Just tell him 
what I said.” 

The connection went dead. 

Pulcher stood holding a dead 
phone, conscious of Lasser standing 
right behind him. 

“So long, Charley,” he said, 
paused, nodded into space and said, 
“So long,” again. 

Then the attorney turned about 
to deliver the committeeman’s mes- 
sage about that most important 
subject, the tickets to the Chester 
A. Arthur Day Dinner. 

Lasser grumbled: “Damn Dick- 
on. He’s into you for one thing after 
another. Where’s he think I’m going 



to get thirty bucks for tickets?” 
“Will, please.” His wife touched 
his arm. 

Lasser hesitated. “Oh, all right. 
But you better get Jimmy off, 
hear?” 

Pulcher got away at last and hur- 
ried out into the cold, slushy street. 

At the corner he caught a 
glimpse of something palely glow- 
ing overhead and stopped, trans- 
fixed. A huge sky trout was swim- j 
ming purposefully down the ! 
avenue. It was a monster, twelve 
feet long, at least, and more than 
two feet thick at the middle. It 
would easily go eighteen, nineteen i 
ounces, the sort of lunker that 1 
sportsmen hiked clear across the , 
Dismal Hills to bag. Pulcher had ; 
never in his life seen one that size, i 
In fact, he could only remember 
seeing one or two fingerlings swim 
over inhabited areas. 

It gave him a cold, worried feel- 
ing. 

The sky fish were about the only 
tourist attraction Altair Nine had 
left to offer. From all over the 
Galaxy sportsmen came to shoot i 
them, with their great porous flesh 
filled with bubbles of hydrogen, real 
biological zeppelins that did not fly 
in the air but swam it. Before hu- 
man colonists arrived, they had 
been Altair Nine’s highest form of 
life. They were so easy to destroy 
with gunfire that they had almost 
been exterminated in the inhabited 
sections. Only in the high, cold hills 
GALAXY 



had a few survived. And now . 

Were even the fish aware that 
Altair Nine was becoming a ghost 
planet? 

T HE next morning Pulcher 
phoned Madeleine but didn’t 
have breakfast with her, though he 
wanted to very much. 

He put in the whole day work- 
ing on the case. In the morning he 
visited the families and friends of 
the accused boys; in the afternoon 
he followed a few hunches. 

From the families he learned 
nothing. The stories were all about 
the same. The youngest boy was 
Foltis, only seventeen; the oldest 
was Hopgood at twenty-six. They 
all had lost their jobs, most of them 
at the Icicle Works; they saw no 
future, and wanted off-planet. Well, 
physical transport meant more 
money than any of them had a 
chance of getting in any legitimate 
way. 

Mayor Swinburne was a rich 
man and his three-year-old son was 
the apple of his eye. It must have 
been an irresistible temptation to 
try to collect ransom money, Pul- 
cher realized. The mayor could cer- 
tainly afford it, and once the money 
was collected and they were aboard 
a starship, it would be almost im- 
possible for the law to pursue them. 

Pulcher managed to piece to- 
gether the way the thing had 
started. The boys all lived in the 
same neighborhood, the neighbor- 



hood where Madeleine and Jon 
Gaultry had had a little apartment. 
They had seen Madeleine walking 
with the mayor’s son — she had a 
part-time job now and then, taking 
care of him. The only aspect that 
was hard to believe was that Made- 
leine had been willing to take part 
in the scheme, once the boys ap- 
proached her. 

But Milo, remembering the ex- 
pression on the girl’s face as she 
looked at the tourists, decided that 
wasn’t so strange after all. 

For Madeleine had rented. 

Physical transport was expen- 
sive and eternally slow. 

But there was a faster way for 
one to travel from planet to planet 
— practically instantaneous, from 
one end of the Galaxy to the other. 
The pattern of the mind is elec- 
tronic in nature. It can be taped, 
and it can be broadcast on an elec- 
tromagnetic frequency. What was 
more, like any electromagnetic sig- 
nal, it could be used to modulate 
an ultrawave carrier. The result: 
instantaneous transmission of per- 
sonality, anywhere in the civilized 
Galaxy. 

The only problem was that there 
had to be a receiver. 

The naked ghost of a man, 
stripped of flesh and juices, was no 
more than the countless radio and 
other waves that passed through 
everyone all the time. The trans- 
mitted personality had to be given 
form. There were mechanical re- 



THE DAY THE ICICLE WORKS CLOSED 



78

ceivers, of course — computerlike 
affairs with mercury memory cells 
— where a man’s intelligence could 
be received, and could be made to 
activate robot bodies. But that 
wasn’t fun. The tourist trade was 
built on fun. 

Live bodies were needed to satis- 
fy the customers. No one wanted to 
spend the price of a fishing trip to 
Altair Nine in order to find him- 
self pursuing the quarry in some 
clanking tractor with photocell eyes 
and solenoid muscles. A body was 
wanted, preferably a rather attrac- 
tive body; one which would be firm 
where the tourist’s own, perhaps, 
was flabby, healthy where the 
tourist’s own wheezed. Having such 
a body, there were other sports to 
enjoy than fishing. 

Oh, the laws were strict about 
misuse of rented bodies. 

But the tourist trade was the 
only flourishing industry left on Al- 
tair Nine. The laws remained 
strict, but they remained unen- 
forced. 

P ULCHER checked in with 
Charley Dickon. “I found out 
why Madeleine got into this thing. 
She rented. Signed a long-term 
lease with the Tourist Agency and 
got a big advance on her earnings.” 
Dickon shook his head sadly. 
“What people will do for money,” 
he commented. 

“It wasn’t for her! She gave it 
to her husband so he could get a 
80 



ticket to some place off-world.” 1 
Pulcher got up, turned around and 1 
kicked his chair as hard as he could. 
Renting was bad enough for a maa 
For a woman it was— 

“Take it easy,” Dickon sug- 
gested, grinning. “So she figured she 
could buy her way out of the con- 
tract with the money from Swin- 
burne?” 

“Wouldn’t you do the same?” 
“Oh, I don’t know, Milo. Rent- 
ing’s not so bad.” 

“The hell it isn’t!” 

“All right, the hell it isn’t. But 
you ought to realize, Milo,” the 
committeeman said stiffly, “that if 
it wasn’t for the tourist trade, we’d 
all be in trouble. Don’t knock the 
Tourist Agency. They’re doing a 
perfectly decent job.” 

“Then why won’t they let me see 
the records?” 

The committeeman’s eyes nar- 
rowed and he sat up straighten 
“I tried,” said Pulcher. “I got 
them to show me Madeleine’s lease 
agreement, but not till I threatened 
them with a court order. Why? 
Then I tried to find out a little 
more about the Agency itself — in- 
corporation papers, names of share- 
holders and so on. They wouldn’t 
give me a thing. Why?” 

Dickon said, after a second; “I 
could ask you that too, Milo. Why 
did you want to know?” 

Pulcher said seriously: “I have 
to make a case any way I can, 
Charley. On the evidence, they’re 



guilty. But every one of them went 
into this kidnapping stunt in order 
to stay away from renting. Maybe 
I can’t get Judge Pegrim to listen 
to that kind of evidence, but 
maybe I can. It’s my only chance. 
If I can show that renting is a form 
of cruel and unusual abuse — if I 
can find something wrong in it, 
something that isn’t allowed in its 
charter — then I have that chance. 
Not a good chance, but a chance. 
And there’s got to be something 
wrong, Charley, because otherwise 
why would they be so secretive?” 

Dickon said heavily: “You’re 
getting in pretty deep, Milo. Ever 
occur to you you’re going about 
this the wrong way?” 

“Wrong how?” 

“What can the incorporation pa- 
pers show you? You want to find 
out what renting’s like. It seems to 
me the only way that makes sense 
is to try it yourself.” 

“Rent? Me?” Pulcher was 
shocked. 

The committeeman shrugged. 
“Well, I got a lot to do,” he said, 
and escorted Pulcher to the door. 

The lawyer walked sullenly 
away. Rent? But he had to admit 
that there was a certain amount of 
sense . 

He made a private decision. He 
would do what he could to get 
Madeleine and the others out of 
trouble. Completely out of trouble. 
But if, in the course of trying the 
case, he couldn’t magic up some 



way of getting her out of the lease 
agreement as well as getting an 
acquittal, he would make damn 
sure that he didn’t get the acquittal. 

Jail wasn’t so bad. Renting, for 
Madeleine Gaultry, was consider- 
ably worse. 

Ill 

TVTEXT morning Pulcher marched 

’ into the unemployment of- 
fice with an air of determination far 
exceeding what he really felt. Talk 
about loyalty to a client! But he 
had spent the whole night brood- 
ing about it, and Dickon had been 
right. 

The clerk blinked a him and 
wheezed: “Gee, you’re Mr. Pul- 
cher, aren’t you? I never thought 
I’d see you here. Things pretty 
slow?” 

Pulcher’s uncertainty made him 
belligerent. “I want to rent my 
body. Am I in the right place or 
not?” 

‘Well, sure, Mr. Pulcher. I mean, 
you’re not, if it’s voluntary, but it’s 
been so long since they had a vol- 
untary that it don’t make much dif- 
ference, you know. I mean, I can 
handle it for you. Wait a minute.” 
He turned away, hesitated, glanced 
at Pulcher and said: “I better use 
the other phone.” 

He was gone only a minute. He 
came back with a look of deter- 
mined embarrassment. “Mr. Pul- 
cher. Look. I thought I better call

Charley Dickon. He isn’t in his of- 
fice. Why don’t you wait until I 
can clear it with him?” 

Pulcher said grimly: “It’s al- 
ready cleared with him.” 

The clerk hesitated. “But — Oh. 
All right,” he said miserably, scrib- 
bling on a pad. “Right across the 
street Oh, and tell them you’re a 
volunteer. I don’t know if that will 
make them leave the cuffs off you, 
but at least it’ll give them a laugh.” 
Pulcher took the slip of paper 
and walked sternly across the street 
to the Tourist Rental Agency, Pro- 
curement Office, observing without 
pleasure that there were bars on the 
windows. 

A husky guard at the door 
straightened up as he approached 
and said genially: “All right, son- 
ny. It isn’t going to be as bad as 
you think. Just gimme your wrists 
a minute.” 

“Wait,” said Pulcher quickly, 
putting his hands behind him. “You 
won’t need the handcuffs for me. 
I’m a volunteer.” 

The guard said dangerously: 
“Don’t kid with me, sonny.” Then 
he took a closer look. “Hey, I know 
you. You’re the lawyer. I saw you 
at the Primary Dance.” He 
scratched his ear. He said doubt- 
fully: “Well, maybe you are a vol- 
unteer. Go on in.” 

But as Pulcher strutted past, he 
felt a heavy hand on his shoulder, 
and click, click, his wrists were cir- 
cled with steel. He whirled. 



“No hard feelings,” said the 
guard cheerfully. “It costs a lot of 
dough to get you ready, that’s all. 
They don’t want you changing your 
mind when they give you the 
squeeze, see?” 

“The squeeze? All right,” said 
Pulcher, and turned away again 
uneasily. 

The squeeze. It didn’t sound so 
good, at that. But he had a little too 
much pride left to ask the guard for 
details. Anyway, it couldn’t be too 
bad, he was sure. Wasn’t he? After 
all, it wasn’t the same as being 
executed. 

An hour and a half later he 
wasn’t so sure. 

They had stripped him, weighed 
him, fluorographed him, taken sam- 
ples of his blood, saliva, urine and 
spinal fluid; they had thumped his 
chest and listened to the strangled 
pounding of the arteries in his left 
arm. 

“You pass,” said a forty ish 
blonde in a stained nurse’s uniform. 
“You’re lucky today — openings all 
over. You can take your pick — 
mining, sailing, anything you like. 
What’ll it be?” 

“What?” 

“While you’re renting. What’s 
the matter with you? You got to be 
doing something while your body’s 
rented. You can have the tank if 
you want to, but they mostly don’t 
like that. You’re conscious the 
whole time, you know. It gets kind 
of boring otherwise.” 



P ULCHER said honestly: “I 
don’t know what you’re talking 
about.” 

But then he remembered. While 
a person’s body was rented out, 
there was the problem of what to 
do with his own mind and person- 
ality. It couldn’t stay in the body. 
It had to go somewhere else. “The 
tank” was a storage device, only 
that and nothing more; the dis- 
placed mind was held in a sort of 
pickling vat of transistors and cells 
until its own body could be re- 
turned to it. He remembered a 
client of his boss’s, while he was 
still clerking, who had spent eight 
weeks in the tank and had then 
come out to commit a murder. No, 
not the tank. 

He said, coughing: “What else 
is there?” 

The nurse said impatiently: 
“Golly, whatever you want, I guess. 
They’ve got a big call for miners 
operating the deep gas generators 
right now, if you want that. It’s pret- 
ty hot is all. They burn the coal 
into gas, and of course you’re right 
in the middle of it. But I don’t 
think you feel much. Not too much. 
I don’t know about sailing or rock- 
eting, because you have to have 
some experience for that. There 
might be something with the taxi 
company, but usually the renters 
don’t want that, I ought to tell you, 
because the live drivers don’t like 
seeing the machines running cabs. 
Sometimes if they see a machine- 



cab they tip it over. Naturally, if 
there’s any damage to the host ma- 
chine, it’s risky for you.” 

Pulcher said faintly: “I’ll try 
mining.” 

He went out of the room in a 
daze, a small bleached towel 
around his middle his only gar- 
ment, and hardly aware of that. His 
own clothes had been whisked 
away and checked long ago. The 
tourist who would shortly wear his 
body would pick his own clothes; 
the haberdashery was one of the 
more profitable subsidiaries of the 
Tourist Agency. 

Then he snapped out of his daze 
as he discovered what was meant 
by “the squeeze.” 

A pair of husky experts lifted 
him onto a slab, whisked away the 
towel, unlocked and tossed away 
the handcuffs. While one pinned 
him down firmly at the shoulders, 
the other began to turn viselike 
wheels that moved molded forms 
down upon him. It was like a sec- 
tional sarcophagus closing in on 
him. 

Pulcher had an instant childhood 
recollection of some story or other 
— the walls closing in, the victim 
inexorably squeezed to death. 

He yelled: “Hey, hold it! What 
are you doing?” 

The man at his head, bored, said : 
“Oh, don’t worry. This your first 
time? We got to keep you still, see? 
Scanning’s close work.” 

“But-”

“Now shut up and relax,” the 
man said reasonably. “If you wiggle 
when the tracer’s scanning you, you 
could get your whole personality 
messed up. Not only that, we might 
damage the body an’ then the 
Agency’d have a suit on its hands, 
see? Tourists don’t like damaged 
bodies . Come on, Vince. Get 
the legs lined up so I can do the 
head.” 

“But—” said Pulcher again, and 
then, with effort, relaxed. 

It was only for one day, after all. 
He could stand practically any- 
thing for a day, and he had been 
careful to sign up for only that long. 

“Go ahead,” he said. “It’s only for 
twenty-four hours.” 

“What? Oh, sure, friend. Lights 
out, now. Have a pleasant dream.” 

And something soft but quite 
firm came down over his face. 

He heard a muffled sound of 
voices. Then there was a quick rip- 
ping feeling, as though he had been 
plucked out of some sticky sur- 
rounding medium. 

Then it hurt. 

Pulcher screamed. It didn’t ac- 
complish anything. He no longer 
had a voice to scream with. 

UNNY, he had always thought 
of mining as something that was 
carried on underground. He was 
under water. There wasn’t any 
doubt of it. He could see vagrant 
eddies of sand moving in a current. 
He could see real fish, not the 



_ 




hydrogen zeppelins of the air. He 
could see bubbles, arising from 
some source in the sand at his feet— 

No! Not at his feet. He didn’t 
have feet. He had tracks. 

A great steel bug swam up in 
front of him and said raspingly: 
“All right, you there, let’s go.” 

Funny again. He didn’t hear the 
voice with ears — he didn’t have 
ears, and there was no binaural 
sense — but he did, somehow, hear. 
It seemed to be speaking inside his 
brain. Radio? Sonar? 

“Come on!” growled the bug. 

Experimentally, Pulcher tried to 
walk. 

“Watch it!” squeaked a thin lit- 
tle voice, and a tiny, many-treaded 
steel beetle squirmed out from un- 
der his tracks. It paused to rear 
back and look at him. “Dope!” it 
chattered scathingly. A bright flame 
erupted from its snout as it 
squirmed away. 

The big bug rasped: “Go on, fol- 
low the burner, Mac.” 

Pulcher thought of walking, 
rather desperately. Yes, something 
was happening. He lurched and 
moved. 

“Oh, God,” sighed the steel bug, 
hanging beside him, watching with 
critical attention. “This your first 
time? I figured. They always give 
me the new ones to break in. Look, 
that burner — the little thing that 
just went down the cline, Mac! 
That’s a burner. It’s going to burn 
the hard rock out of a new shaft. 



84 



GALAXY 



THE DAY THE ICICLE WORKS CLOSED 



85 







You follow it and pull the sludge 
out. With your buckets, Mac.” 
Pulcher gamely started his 
treads and lurchingly followed the 
little burner. All around him, vis- 
ible through the churned, silty 
water, he caught glimpses of other 
machines working. There were big 
ones and little ones, some with 
great elephantine flexible steel 
trunks that sucked silt and mud 
away, some with wasp’s stingers 
that planted charges of explosive, 
some like himself with buckets for 
hauling and scooping out pits. The 
mine, whatever sort of mine it was 
to be, was only a bare scratched-out 
beginning on the sea floor as yet. 
It took him — an hour? a minute? 
he had no means of telling time— 
to learn the rudiments of operating 
his new steel body. 

Then it became dull. 

Also it became painful. The first 
few scoops of sandy grime he car- 
ried out of the new pit made his 
buckets tingle. The tingle became 
a pain, the pain an ache, the ache 
a blazing agony. He stopped. Some- 
thing was wrong. They couldn’t ex- 
pect him to go on like this! 

“Hey, Mac. Get busy, will you?” 
“But it hurts.” 

“Godamighty, Mac, it’s supposed 
to hurt. How else would you be able 
to feel when you hit something 
hard? You want to break your 
buckets on me, Mac?” 

Pulcher gritted his not-teeth, 
squared his not-shoulders, and went 
86 



back to digging. Ultimately the 
pain became, through habit, bear- 
able. It didn’t become less. It just 
became bearable. 

TT was tiresome, except when 
once he did strike a harder rock 
than his phosphor-bronze buckets 
could handle, and had to slither 
back out of the way while the 
burner chopped it up for him. But 
that was the only break in the 
monotony. Otherwise the work was 
strictly routine. It gave him plenty 
of time to think. 

That was not altogether a boon. 

I wonder, he thought, with a 
drowned clash of buckets, I wonder 
what my body is doing now. 

Perhaps the tenant who now oc- 
cupied his body was a businessman, 
Pulcher thought prayerfully. A man 
who had had to come to Altair Nine 
quickly, on urgent business — get a 
contract signed, make a trading 
deal, arrange an interstellar loan. 
That wouldn’t be so bad! A busi- 
nessman would not damage a 
rented property. At the worst, a 
businessman might drink one or 
two cocktails too many, perhaps eat 
an indigestible lunch. All right. So 
when — in only a few hours now — 
Pulcher resumed his body, the 
worst he could expect would be a 
hangover or dyspepsia. Well, what 
of that? An aspirin. A dash of 
bicarb. 

But maybe the tourist would not 
be a businessman. 



GALAXY 



Pulcher flailed the coarse sand 
with his buckets and thought ap- 
prehensively : He might be a sports- 
man. Still, even that wouldn’t be so 
bad. A sportsman might walk his 
body up and down a few dozen 
mountains, perhaps even sleep it 
out in the open overnight. There 
might be a cold, possibly even pneu- 
monia. There might also be an ac- 
cident — tourists did fall off the 
Dismal Hills; there could be a 
broken leg. But that was not too 
bad. It was only a matter of a few 
days’ rest, a little medical atten- 
tion. 

But maybe, Pulcher thought 
grayly, ignoring the teeming agony 
of his buckets, maybe the tenant 
will be something worse. 

He had heard queer, smutty 
stories about rented bodies, each 
one against the law. But you kept 
hearing the stories. All of them 
were unpleasant. And yet in a 
rented body, where the ultimate 
price of dissipation would be borne 
by someone else, who might not try 
any or all pleasures and lusts? For 
there was no physical consequence 
to the practitioner. If Mrs. Lasser 
was right, perhaps there was not 
even a consequence in the here- 
after. 

Twenty-four hours had never 
passed so slowly.

with the burners. The scoops 
quarreled with the dynamiters. All 
THE DAY THE ICICLE WORK 



the animate submarine mining ma- 
chines constantly irritably snapped 
at each other. But the work was 
getting done. 

It seemed to be a lot of work to 
accomplish in one twenty-four hour 
day, Pulcher thought wearily. The 
pit was down two hundred yard 9 
now, and braced. New wet-setting 
concrete pourers were already lay- 
ing a floor. Shimmery little spider- 
like machines whose limbs held 
chemical testing equipment were 
now sniffing every load of sludge 
that came out for richness of ore. 
The mine was nearly ready to start 
producing. 

After a time Pulcher began to 
understand the short tempers of 
the machines. The minds in these 
machines were not able to forget 
that, up topside, their bodies were 
going about unknown errands, risk- 
ing unguessed dangers. At any 
given moment that concrete pour- 
er’s body, for instance, might be dy- 
ing . might be acquiring a disease 
. might be stretched out in nar- 
cotic stupor, or might gayly be risk- 
ing dismemberment in a violent 
sport. Naturally tempers were 
touchy. 

There was no such thing as rest, 
as coffee breaks or sleep for the ma- 
chines; they kept going. When fi- 
nally Pulcher remembered that he 
had had a purpose in coming here, 
that it was not merely some pun- 
ishment that had come blindly to 
him for a forgotten sin, he began 
SCLOSED 87 



to try to analyze his own feelings 
and to guess at the feelings of the 
others. 

The whole thing seemed un- 
necessarily mean. Pulcher under- 
stood quite clearly why anyone 
who had had the experience of rent- 
ing would never want to do it again. 
But why did it have to be so un- 
pleasant? Surely conditions for the 
renter-mind in a machine-body 
could be made more bearable; the 
tactile sensations could be reduced 
from pain to some more support- 
able feeling without loss of sensa- 
tion enough to accomplish the de- 
sired ends. 

He wondered wistfully if Made- 
leine had once occupied this par- 
ticular machine. 

Then he wondered how many of 
the dynamiters and diggers were 
female, how many male. It seemed 
somehow wrong that their gleam- 
ing stainless-steel or phosphor- 
bronze exteriors should give no hint 
of age or sex. There ought to be 
some lighter work for women, he 
thought idly, and then realized that 
the thought was nonsense. What 
difference did it make? You could 
work your buckets off, and when 
you got back topside you’d be 
healthy and rested . 

And then he had a quick dizzy- 
ing qualm, as he realized that that 
would be the thought in the mind 
of the tourist now occupying his 
own body. 

Pulcher licked his not-lips and 



attacked the sand with his buckets 
more viciously than before. 

“All right, Mac.” The familiar 
steel bug was alongside him. “Come 
on, back to the barn,” it scolded. 
“You think I want to have to haul 
you there? Time’s up. Get the 
tracks back in the parking lot.” 

Never was an order so gladly 
obeyed. 

But the overseer had cut it rather 
fine. Pulcher had just reached the 
parking space, had not quite 
turned his clanking steel frame 
around when, rip, the tearing and 
the pain hit him . 

And he found himself struggling 
against “the squeeze.” 

ELAX, friend,” soothed a 
distant voice. Abruptly the 
pressure was removed from his face 
and the voice came nearer. “There 
you are. Have a nice dream?” 

Pulcher kicked the rubbery ma- 
terial off his legs. He sat up. 

“Ouch!” he said suddenly, and 
held his eye. 

The man by his head looked 
down at him and grinned. “Some 
shiner. Must’ve been a good party.” 
He was stripping the sections of 
rubbery gripping material off Pul- 
cher as he talked. “You’re lucky. 
I’ve seen them come back in here 
with legs broken, teeth out, even 
bullet holes. Friend, you wouldn’t 
believe me if I told you. Especial- 
ly the girls.” He handed Pulcher 
GALAXY 



r another bleached towel. “All right, 
you’re through here. Don’t worry 
about the eye, friend. That’s easy 
two, three days old already. An- 
other day or two and you won’t 
even notice it” 

“Hey!” Pulcher cried suddenly. 
“What do you mean, two or three 
days? How long was I down there?” 
The man glanced at the green- 
tabbed card on Pulcher’s wrist. 
“Let’s see, this is Thursday. Six 
days.” 

“But I only signed up for twen- 
ty-four hours!” 

“Sure you did. Plus emergency 
overcalls. What do you think, 
friend— the Agency’s going to evict 
some big-spending tourist just be- 
cause you want your body back in 
twenty-four hours? Can’t do it. You 
can see that. The Agency’d lose a 
fortune that way.” 
Unceremoniously, Pulcher was 
hoisted to his feet and escorted to 
the door. 

“If only these jokers would read 
the fine print,” the first man was 
saying mournfully to his helper as 
Pulcher left. “Oh, well. If they had 
any brains, they wouldn’t rent in 
the first place. Then what would 
me and you do for jobs?” 

Six days! Pulcher raced through 
medical check-out, clothes redemp- 
tion. payoff at the cashier’s window. 

“Hurry, please,” he kept saying, 
“can’t you please hurry?” He 
couldn’t wait to get to a phone. 

THE DAY THE ICICLE WORK 



But he had a pretty good idea 
already what the phone call would 
tell him. Five extra days! No won- 
der it had seemed so long down 
there, while up in the city time had 
passed along. 

He found a phone at last and 
quickly dialed the private number 
of Judge Pegrim’s office. The judge 
wouldn’t be there, but that was the 
way Pulcher wanted it. He didn’t 
want to face the judge. 

He got Pegrim’s secretary. “Miss 
Kish? This is Milo Pulcher.” 

Her voice was cold. “So there 
you are. Where have you been? 
The judge was furious.” 

“I—” He despaired of explaining 
it to her. He could hardly explain it 
to himself. “I’ll tell you later, Miss 
Kish. Please. Where does the kid- 
nap case stand now?” 

“Why, the hearing was yester- 
day. Since we couldn’t locate you, 
the judge had to appoint another 
attorney. After all, Mr. Pulcher, an 
attorney is supposed to be in court 
when his clients are coming up for 
trial.” 

“I know that, Miss Kish. What 
happened?” 

“It was open and shut. They all 
pleaded non vult — the whole thing 
was over in twenty minutes. It was 
the only thing to do on the evi- 
dence, you see. They’ll be sen- 
tenced this afternoon— around three 
o’clock, I’d say. If you’re inter- 
ested.”

TT was snowing again, blue this 
time. Pulcher paid the cab 
driver and ran up the steps of the 
courthouse. As he reached for the 
door, he caught sight of three air 
fish solemnly swimming around the 
corner of the building toward him. 
Even in his hurry, he paused to 
glance at them. 

It was past three, but the judge 
had not yet entered the courtroom. 
There were no spectators, but the 
six defendants were already in their 
, seats, a bailiff lounging next to 
them. Counsel’s table was occupied 
by — Pulcher squinted — oh, by 
Donley. Pulcher knew the other 
lawyer slightly. He was a youngster, 
with good political connections — 
that explained the court’s appoint- 
ing him for the fee when Pulcher 
didn’t show up — but without much 
to recommend him otherwise. 

Madeleine Gaultry looked up as 
Pulcher approached, then looked 
away. One of the boys caught sight 
of him, scowled, whispered to the 
others. Their collective expressions 
were enough to sear his spirit. 

Pulcher sat at the table beside 
Donley. “Hello. Mind if I join 
you?” 

Donley twisted his head. “Oh, 
hello, Charley. Sure. I didn’t ex- 
pect to see you here.” He laughed. 
“Say, that eye’s pretty bad. I 
guess—” 

90 



He stopped. 

Something happened in Donley’s 
face. The soft young cheeks be- 
came harder, older, more worried- 
looking. Donley clamped his lips 
shut. 

Pulcher was puzzled. “What’s 
the matter? Are you wondering 
where I was?” 

Donley said stiffly: “Well, you 
can’t blame me for that.” 

“I couldn’t help it, Donley. I was 
renting. I was trying to gather evi- 
dence — not that that helps much 
now. I found one thing out, though. 
Even a lawyer can goof in reading 
a contract. Did you know the Tour- 
ist Agency has the right to retain 
a body for up to forty-five days, re- 
gardless of the original agreement? 
It’s in their contract I was lucky, I 
guess. They only kept me an extra 
five.” 

Donley’s face did not relax. 
“That’s interesting,” he said non- 
committally. 

The man’s attitude was most 
peculiar. Pulcher could understand 
being needled by Donley — could 
even understand this coldness if it 
had been from someone else — but 
it wasn’t like Donley to take mere 
negligence so seriously. 

But before he could try to pin 
down exactly what was wrong, the 
other lawyer stood up. “On your 
feet, Pulcher,” he said in a stage 
whisper. “Here comes the judge!” 
Pulcher jumped up. 

GALAXY 



He could feel Judge Pegrim’s 
eyes rake over him. They scratched 
like diamond-tipped drills. In an 
ordinarily political, reasonably cor- 
rupt community, Judge Pegrim was 
one man who took his job serious- 
ly and expected the same from 
those around him. 

“Mr. Pulcher,” he purred. “We’re 
honored to have you with us.” 
Pulcher began an explanation, 
but the judge waved it away. “Mr. 
Pulcher, you do know, don’t you, 
that an attorney is an officer of the 
court? And, as such, is expected to 
know his duties — and to fulfill 
them?” 

“Well, Your Honor, I thought I 
was fulfilling them. I—” 

“I’ll discuss it with you at an- 
other time, Mr. Pulcher,” the judge 
said. “Right now we have a rather 
disagreeable task to get through. 
Bailiff! Let’s get started.” 

Donley made a couple of rou- 
tine motions, but there was no ques- 
tion about what would happen. It 
happened. Each of the defendants 
drew a ten-year sentence. The 
judge pronounced it distastefully, 
adjourned the court and left. He 
did not look at Milo Pulcher. 

Pulcher tried for a moment to 
catch Madeleine’s eye. Then he 
succeeded. Shaken, he turned away, 
bumping into Donley. 

“I don’t understand it,” he mum- 
bled. 

‘What don’t you understand?” 

THE DAY THE ICICLE WORK 



“Well, don’t you think that's a 
pretty stiff sentence?” 

Donley shrugged. He wasn’t 
very interested. Pulcher scanned 
the masklike young face. There was 
no sympathy there. It was weird 
in a way. This was a face of flint; 
the plight of six young people, each 
doomed to spend a decade of their 
lives in prison, did not move him 
at all. 

Pulcher said dispiritedly: “I 
think I'll go see Dickon.” 

‘Do that,” said Donley curtly, 
and turned away. 

"D UT Pulcher couldn’t find 
Dickon. He wasn’t at his of- 
fice, wasn’t at the club. 

“Nope,” said the garrulous re- 
tired police lieutenant who was the 
club president — and used the club 
headquarters as a checker salon. 
“I haven’t seen him in a couple of 
days. Be at the dinner tonight, 
though. You’ll see him there.” 

It wasn’t a question, whether 
Pulcher would be at the dinner or 
not; Pop Craig knew he would. 
After all, Dickon had passed the 
word out. Everybody would be 
there. 

Pulcher went back to his apart- 
ment. 

It was the first time he had sur- 
veyed his body since reclaiming 
it. The bathroom mirror told him 
that he had a gorgeous shiner in- 
deed. Also certain twinges made 

S CLOSED 91 



him strip and examine his back. 
It looked, he thought gloomily, 
staring over his shoulder into the 
mirror, as though whoever had 
rented his body had had a perfectly 
marvelous time. He made a mental 
note to get a complete checkup 
someday soon, just in case. Then 
he showered, shaved, talcumed 
around the black eye without much 
success, and dressed. 

He sat down, poured himself a 
drink and promptly forgot it was 
there. Something was trying to 
reach the surface of his mind. 
Something perfectly obvious that 
he all the same couldn’t quite put 
his finger on. It was annoying. 

He found himself drowsily think- 
ing of air fish. 

Damn, he thought grouchily, his 
body’s late tenant hadn’t even 
troubled to give it a decent night’s 
sleep! But he didn’t want to sleep, 
not now. It was still only early 
evening. He supposed the Chester 
A. Arthur Day dinner was still a 
must, but there were hours yet be- 
fore that. 

He got up, poured the untasted 
drink into the sink and set out. 
There was one thing he could try 
to help Madeleine. It probably 
wouldn’t work. But nothing else 
would either, so that was no reason 
for not trying it. 

TP HE mayor’s mansion was 
ablaze with light; something 
was going on.

r 

I r 



Pulcher trudged up the long, cir. 
cling driveway in slush that kept 
splattering his ankles. He tappei 
gingerly on the door. 

The butler took his name doubt- 
fully and isolated Pulcher in a con- 
tagion-free sitting room while he 
went off to see if the mayor would 
care to admit such a person. He 
came back looking incredulous. 
The mayor would. 

Mayor Swinburne was a healthy 
lean man of medium height, show 
ing only by his thinning hair that' 
he was in his middle forties. 

Pulcher said: “Mr. Mayor, I 
guess you know who I am. I repre- 
sent the six kids who were accused 
of kidnapping your son.” 

“Not accused, Mr. Pulcher. Con- 
victed. And I didn’t know you still 
represented them.” 

“I see you know the score. All 
right. Maybe, in a legal sense, I 
don’t represent them any more. But 
I’d like to make some representa- 
tions on their behalf to you tonight 
— entirely unofficially.” He gave 
the mayor a crisply worded, brief 
outline of what had happened in 
the case, how he had rented, what 
he had found as a renter, why he 
had missed the hearing. “You see, 
sir, the Tourist Agency doesn’t give 
its renters even ordinary courtesy. 
They’re just bodies, nothing else. 
I can’t blame those kids. Now that 
I’ve rented myself, I’ll have to say 
that I wouldn’t blame anybody who 
did anything to avoid it.” 



The mayor said dangerously: 
“Mr. Pulcher, I don’t have to re- 
mind you that what’s left of our 
economy depends heavily on the 
Tourist Agency for income. Also 
that some of our finest citizens are 
among its shareholders.” 

“Including yourself, Mr. Mayor. 
Right.” Pulcher nodded. “But the 
management may not be reflecting 
your wishes. I’ll go further. I think, 
sir, that every contract the Tourist 
Agency holds with a renter ought 
to be voided as against public poli- 
cy. Renting out one’s body for a 
purpose which well may be in vio- 
lation of law — which, going by ex- 
perience, nine times out of ten does 
involve a violation of law — is the 
same thing as contracting to per- 
form any other illegal act. The con- 
tract simply cannot be enforced. 
The common law gives us a great 
many precedents on this point, 
and-” 

“Please, Mr. Pulcher. I’m not a 
judge. If you feel so strongly, why 
not take it to court?” 

pULCHER sank back into his 
chair, deflated. “There isn’t 
time,” he admitted. “Besides, it’s 
too late for that to help the six per- 
sons I’m interested in. They’ve al- 
ready been driven into an even 
more illegal act in order to escape 
renting. I’m only trying to explain 
it to you, sir, because you are their 
only hope. You can pardon them.” 
The mayor’s face turned beet 



red. “Executive clemency from me 
— for them?” 

“They didn’t hurt your boy.” 

“No, they did not,” the mayor 
agreed. “And I’m sure that Mrs. 
Gaultry, at least, would not willing- 
ly have done so. But can you say 
the same of the others? Could she 
have prevented it?” He stood up. 
“I’m sorry, Mr. Pulcher. The an- 
swer is no. Now you must excuse 
me.” 

Pulcher hesitated, then accepted 
the dismissal. There wasn’t any- 
thing else to do. 

He walked somberly down the 
hall toward the entrance, hardly 
noticing that guests were beginning 
to arrive. Apparently the mayor 
was offering cocktails to a select 
few. He recognized some of the 
faces — Lew Yoder, the county tax 
assessor for one; probably the 
mayor was having some of the 
white-collared politicians in for 
drinks before making the obligatory 
appearance at Dickon’s fund-rais- 
ing dinner. Pulcher looked up long 
enough to nod grayly at Yoder and 
walked on. 

“Charley Dickon! What the 
devil are you doing here like that?” 

Pulcher jerked upright. Dickon 
here? He looked around. 

But Dickon was not in sight. 
Only Yoder was coming down the 
corridor toward him, was looking 
straight at him! And it had been 
Yoder’s voice. 

Yoder’s face froze.

The expression on Yoder’s face 
was a peculiar one, but not un- 
familiar to Milo Pulcher. He had 
seen it once before, that day. It 
was the identical expression he had 
seen on the face of that young 
squirt who had replaced him in 
court, Donley. 

Yoder said awkwardly: “Oh, 
Milo, it’s you. I, uh, thought you 
were Charley Dickon.” 

Pulcher felt the hairs at the back 
of his neck tingle. Something was 
odd here. Very odd. 

“It’s a perfectly natural mistake,” 
he said. “I’m six feet tall and Char- 
ley’s five feet seven. I’m thirty-one 
years old and he’s fifty. I’m dark 
and he’s almost bald. I don’t know 
how anybody ever tells us apart.” 
“What the devil are you talking 
about?” Yoder blustered. 

Pulcher looked at him thought- 
fully for a second. “I’m not sure. 
Are you?” Yoder spun and walked 
angrily away. 



V 

S OME things never change. 

Across the entrance to the New 
Metropolitan Cafe & Men’s Grille, 
a long scarlet banner carried the 
words: VOTE THE STRAIGHT 
TICKET! Big poster portraits of 
the mayor and Committeeman 
Dickon flanked the door itself. A 
squat little sound truck parked out- 
side the door blared ancient 
marches of the sort that political 



conventions had suffered through 
for more than two centuries back 
on Earth. 

It was an absolutely conven- 
tional political fund-raising dinner. 
It would have the absolutely con- 
ventional embalmed roast beef, the 
one conventionally free watery 
Manhattan at each place and the 
conventionally boring after-dinner 
speeches. (Except for one.) 

Milo Pulcher, stamping about 
in the slush outside the entrance, 
looked up at the constellations 
visible from Altair Nine and won- 
dered if those same stars were look- 
ing down on just such another thou- 
sand dinners all over the Galaxy. 
Politics went on wherever you 
were. The constellations would be 
different, to be sure; the Squirrel 
and the Nut were local stars and 
would have no shape at all from 
any other solar system. But . 

He caught sight of the tall, thin 
figure he was waiting for and 
stepped out into the stream of 
small-time political workers, ignor- 
ing their greetings. “Judge. I’m 
glad you came.” 

Judge Pegrim said frostily: “I 
gave you my word, Milo. But 
you’ve got a lot to answer for if this 
is a false alarm. I don’t ordinarily 
attend partisan political affairs.” 

“It isn’t an ordinary affair, 
Judge.” 

Pulcher conducted him into the 
room and sat him at the table he 
had prepared. Once it had held 
GALAXY 



94 



place cards for four election-board 
workers from the warehouse dis- 
trict, who now buzzed from table to 
table angrily; Pulcher had filched 
their cards. 

The judge was grumbling: “It 
doesn’t comport well with the 
bench to attend this sort of thing, 
Milo. I don’t like it.” 

“I know, Judge. You’re an honest 
man. Thafs why I wanted you 
here.” 

“Mmm.” 

Pulcher left him before the 
Mmm could develop into a ques- 
tion. He had fended off enough 
questions since the thoughtful half- 
hour he had spent pacing back and 
forth in front of the mayor’s man- 
sion. He didn’t want to fend off 
any more. As he skirted the tables, 
heading for the private room 
where he had left his special guests, 
Dickon caught his arm. 

“Hey, Milo! I see you got the 
judge out. Good boy! He’s just 
what we needed to make this din- 
ner complete.” 

“Complete— yes, I hope so,” said 
Pulcher and went on. He didn’t 
look back. There was another fine 
potential question-source; and the 
committeeman’s would be even 
more difficult to answer than the 
judge’s. Besides, he wanted to see 
Madeleine. 

The girl and her five accomplices 
were where he had left them. The 
private bar where they were sitting 
was never used for affairs like this. 
THE DAY THE ICICLE WORK 



You couldn’t see the floor from it. 
Still, you could hear well enough, 
and that was more important. 

The boys were showing nervous- 
ness in their different ways. Al- 
though they had been convicted 
hardly more than a day, had been 
sentenced only a few hours, they 
had fallen quickly into the convict 
habit. Being out on bail so ab- 
ruptly was a surprise. They hadn’t 
expected it. It made them edgy. 
Young Foltis was jittering about 
to himself. The Hopgood boy was 
slumped despondently in a corner, 
blowing smoke rings. Jimmy Las- 
ser was making a castle out of 
sugar cubes. 

Only Madeleine was relaxed. 

As Pulcher came in, she looked 
up calmly. 

“Is everything all right?” 

He crossed his fingers and nod- 
ded. 

“Don’t worry,” she said. 

Pulcher blinked. Don’t worry. It 
should have been he who was say- 
ing that to her, not the other way 
around. It came to him that there 
was only one possible reason for 
her quiet confidence. 

She trusted him. 

D UT he couldn’t stay. The ball- 
room was full now, and irri- 
table banquet waiters were crash- 
ing plates down in front of the 
loyal Party workers. He had a 
couple of last-minute things to at- 
tend to. He carefully avoided the

eye of Judge Pegrim, militantly 
alone at the table by the speaker’s 
dais and walked quickly across the 
room to Jimmy Lasser’s father. 

He said without preamble: “Do 
you want to help your son?” 

Phil Lasser snarled: “You cheap 
shyster! You wouldn’t even show 
up for the trial! Where do you get 
the nerve to ask me a question like 
that?” 

“Shut up. Do you or don’t you?” 
Lasser hesitated, then read 
something in Pulcher’s eyes. “Well, 
of course I do,” he grumbled. 

‘Then tell me something. It 
won’t sound important, but it is. 
How many rifles did you sell in the 
past year?” 

Lasser looked puzzled, but he 
said. “Not many. Maybe half a 
dozen. Business is lousy all over, 
you know, since the Icicle Works 
closed.” 

“And in a normal year?” 

“Oh, three or four hundred. It’s a 
big tourist item. You see, they need 
cold-shot rifles for hunting the air 
fish. A regular bullet’ll set them on 
fire-touches off the hydrogen. I’m 
the only sporting-goods merchant 
in town that carries them and — 
say, what does that have to do with 
Jimmy?” 

Pulcher took a deep breath. 
“Stick around and you’ll find out. 
Meanwhile, think about what you 
just told me. If rifles are a tourist 
item, why did closing the Icicle 
Works hurt your sales?” 

RKS CLOSED

He left. 

But not quickly enough. Dickon 
scuttled over and clutched his arm, 
his face furious. “Milo, what the 
hell! I just heard from Sam Apfel 
— the bondsman — that you got 
that whole bunch out of jail again 
on bail. How come?” 

“They’re my clients.” 

“Don’t give me that! How could 
you get them out when they’re con- 
victed, anyway?” 

“I’m going to appeal the case,” 
Pulcher said. 

“You don’t have a leg to stand 
on! Why would Pegrim grant 
bail?” 

Pulcher pointed to Judge Pe- 
grim’s solitary table. “Ask him,” he 
invited, and broke away. 

He was burning a great many 
bridges behind him, he knew. It 
was an exhilarating feeling. Chancy 
but tingly; he decided he liked it. 
There was just one job to do. As 
soon as he was clear of the com- 
mitteeman, he walked by a circu- 
lar route to the dais. Dickon was 
walking back to his table, turned 
away from the dais; Pulcher’s 
chance would never be better. 

“Hello, Pop,” he said. 

Pop Craig looked up over his 
glasses. “Oh, Milo. I’ve been going 
over the list You think I got every- 
body? Dickon wanted me to intro- 
duce all the block captains and 
anybody else important You 
know anybody important that ain’t 
on this list?” 



“That’s what I wanted to tell 1 
you, Pop. Dickon said for you to ! 
give me a few minutes. I want to 
say a few words.” 

Craig said agitatedly: “Aw, 

Milo, if you make a speech, they’re 
all gonna want to make speeches! j 
What do you want to make a 
speech for? You’re no candidate.” 
Pulcher winked mysteriously. 
“What about next year?” he asked 
archly, with a lying inference. 

“Oh. Oh -ho.” Pop Craig nodded 
and returned to his list, mumbling. 
“Well. In that case. I guess I can 
fit you in after the block captains, 
or maybe after the man from the 
Sheriff’s office—” 

But Pulcher wasn’t listening. He 
was already on his way back to the 
little private bar. 

M AN had conquered all of 
space within nearly fifty light- 
years of dull, yellow old Sol, but 
out in that main ballroom political 
hacks were talking of long-dead 
heads of almost forgotten countries 
centuries in the past Pulcher was 
content to listen — to allow the 
sounds to vibrate his eardrums, at 
least, for the words made little 
sense to him. If, indeed, there was 
any content of sense to a political 
speech in the first place. But they 
were soothing. 

Also they kept his six fledglings 
from bothering him with questions. 
Madeleine sat quietly by his 
shoulder, quite relaxed still and 



98

smelling faintly, pleasantly, of 
some floral aroma. It was, all in 
all, as pleasant a place to be as 
pulcher could remember in his re- 
cent past. It was too bad that he 
would have to go out of it soon. 

Very soon. 

The Featured Guest had droned 
through his platitudes. The Visit- 
ing Celebrities had said their few 
words each. 

Pop Craig’s voluminous old voice 
took over again. “And now I wanta 
introduce some of the fine Party 
workers from our local districts. 
There’s Keith Ciccarelli from the 
Hillside area. Keith, stand up and 
take a bow!” Dutiful applause. 
“And here’s Mary Beth White- 
hurst, head of the Women’s Club 
from Riverview!” Dutiful applause 
- and a whistle. Surely the whistle 
was sardonic; Mary Beth was fat 
and would never again see fifty. 
There were more names. 

Pulcher felt it coming. He was 
on his way to the dais even before 
Craig droned out: “That fine 

young attorney and loyal Party 
man — the kind of young fellow 
our Party needs - Milo Pulcher!” 

Dutiful applause again. That 
was habit, but Pulcher felt the 
whispering question that fluttered 
around the room. 

He didn’t give the question a 
chance to grow. He glanced once 
at the five hundred loyal Party 
faces staring up at him and began 
to speak. 



“Mr. President. Mr. Mayor. Jus- 
tice Pegrim. Honored Guests. La- 
dies and gentlemen.” That was 
protocol. He paused. “What I have 
to say to you tonight is in the way 
of a compliment. It’s a surprise for 
an old friend, sitting right here. 
That old friend is — Charles 
Dickon.” He threw the name at 
them. It was a special political sort 
of delivery, a tone of voice that 
commanded: Clap now. 

They clapped. That was im- 
portant, because it made it difficult 
for Charley to think of an excuse 
to interrupt him — as soon as Char- 
ley realized he ought to, which 
would be shortly. 

“Way out here, on the bleak 
frontier of interstellar space, we 
live isolated lives, ladies and 
gentlemen.” 

There were whispers; he could 
hear them. The words were more 
or less right, but he didn’t have the 
right political accent; the audience 
knew there was something wrong. 
The true politician would have 
said: This fine, growing frontier in 
the midst of interstellar space’s 
greatest constellations. He couldn’t 
help it; he would have to rely on 
velocity now to get him through. 

“How isolated, we sometimes 
need to reflect. We have trade 
relations through the Icicicle 
Works — now closed. We have 
tourists in both directions, through 
the Tourist Agency. We have ul- 
tra-wave messages — also through 



THE DAY THE ICICLE WORKS CLOSED 



99 



the Tourist Agency. And that’s 
about all. 

“That’s a very thin link, ladies 
and gentlemen. Very thin. And I’m 
here to tell you tonight that it 
would be even thinner if it weren’t 
for my old friend there — yes, 
Committeeman Charley Dickon” 

TTE punched the name again 
and got the applause — but it 
was puzzled and died away early. 

“The fact of the matter, ladies 
and gentlemen, is that just about 
every tourist that’s come to Altair 
Nine this past year is the personal 
responsibility of Charley Dickon. 
Who have these tourists been? 
They haven’t been businessmen — 
there’s no business. They haven’t 
been hunters — ask Phil Lasser 
over there; he hasn’t sold enough 
fishing equipment to put in your 
eye. Ask yourselves, for that mat- 
ter. How many of you have seen 
air fish right over the city? Do you 
know why? Because they aren’t 
being hunted any more! There 
aren’t any tourists to hunt them.” 

The time had come to give it to 
them straight. “The fact of the 
matter, ladies and gentlemen, is 
that the tourists we’ve had haven’t 
been tourists at all. They’ve been 
from right here on Altair Nine. 
Some of them are in this room! 
I know that because I rented my- 
self for a few days — and do you 
know who took my body? Why, 
Charley Dickon did. Charley 



Dickon himself rented my body!” ; 

He was watching Lew Yoder 
out of the corner of his eye. The 
assessor’s face turned gray; he 
seemed to shrink. Pulcher enjoyed 
the sight, though he had a certain 
debt to Lew Yoder; it was Yoder’s 
slip of the tongue that had finally 
started him thinking on the right 
track. 

He went on hastily: “And what 
it all adds up to, ladies and gentle- 
men, is that Charley Dickon and 
a handful of his friends in high 
places — most of them right here 
in this room — have cut off com- 
munication between Altair Nine 
and the rest of the Galaxy!” 

There were yells, and the loud- 
est yell came from Charley 
Dickon. “Throw him out! Arrest 
him! Craig, get the sergeant-at- 
arms! I don’t have to sit here and 
listen to this maniac!” 

“And I say you do!” said the 
cold courtroom voice of Judge 
Pegrim. The judge stood up. “Go 
on, Pulcher!” he ordered. “I came 
here tonight to hear what you have 
to say. It may be wrong. It may 
be right. I propose to hear all of 
it before I make up my mind.” 

Thank heaven for the cold old 
judge! Pulcher cut right in before 
Dickon could find a new point of 
attack; there wasn’t much left to 
say anyway. “The story is simple, 
ladies and gentlemen. The Icicle 
Works was the most profitable 
corporation in the Galaxy. We all 



know that. Probably everybody in 
this room had shares of stock. 
Dickon had plenty. 

“But he wanted more. And he 
didn’t want to pay for them. So he 
used his connection with the Tour- 
ist Agency to cut off communi- 
cation between Nine and the rest 
of the Galaxy. He spread the word 
that Altamycin was worthless now 
because some fictitious character 
had invented a cheap new substi- 
tute. He closed down the Icicle 
Works. And for the last twelve 
months he’s been picking up stock 
for a penny on the dollar, while 
the rest of us starve and the Alta- 
mycin that the rest of the Galaxy 
needs stays right here on Altair 
Nine and—” 

He stopped, not because he had 
run out of words but because no 
one could hear them any longer. 
The noises the crowd was making 
were no longer puzzled, they were 
ferocious. It figured. Apart from 
Dickon’s immediate gang of ma- 
nipulators, there was hardly a man 
in the room who hadn’t taken a 
serious loss in the past year from 
the collapse of the Works. 

It was time for the police to 
come rushing in, as per the phone 
call Judge Pegrim had made, pro- 
testingly, when Pulcher urged him 
to attend the dinner. They did - 
barely in time. They weren’t 
needed to arrest Dickon so much 
as keeping him from being 
lynched. 

THE DAY THE ICICLE WORK: 



11/T UCH later, escorting Made- 
leine home, Milo was still 
bubbling over. “I was worried 
about the mayor! I couldn’t make 
up my mind whether he was in it 
with Dickon or not. I’m glad he 
wasn’t, because he said he owed 
me a favor, and I told him how he 
could pay it. Executive clemency. 
The six of you will be free in the 
morning.” 

Madeleine said sleepily: “I’m 
free enough now.” 

‘And the Tourist Agency won’t 
be able to enforce those rental 
contracts any more. I talked it 
over with Judge - Madeleine, 
you’re not listening.” 

She yawned apologetically. “It’s 
been an exhausting day, Milo. 
Anyway, you can tell me all about 
it later. We’ll have plenty of time.” 
Years and years,” he promised. 
He stopped talking. Peeking 
over his shoulder at them, the 
cab driver grinned sentimentally. 
Youth, he thought. Love. He stif- 
fened, slammed on the brakes, 
leaped out and raced shouting to 
a cab rank, where a machine- 
driven cab stood with its motor 
quaking. 

It seemed like no time before 
there were a dozen human drivers 
threatening the machine, and the 
racket of their retribution was 
deafening, but Madeleine never 
noticed. And neither did the hap- 
piest man on Altair Nine.

ONE PLANET, ONE LANGUAGE 

I REMEMBER a time in the 
history of science fiction when 
it was taken for granted that 
in the near future the United Peo- 
ples of Earth would all talk one 
language. More, since all Earthmen 
would speak the same language, 
they would spread it through the 
Galaxy, or at least through our 
solar system. Maybe the Martian 
villains still whispered to each other 
in “low Martian” (again the same 
assumption: all Mars would speak 
one language), but when it came 



GALAXY 



to discussing business with Earth- 
men and Venusians, they all spoke 
the Earthman’s language. 

Of course there is no “Earth lan- 
guage,” but many people still feel 
that it would be nice if there were. 
And some wonder whether there 
will be. Well, if past history is any 
guide, the answer is a resounding 
no. Even if past history had been 
different, the answer would still 
be no. 

Let us take the Roman Empire 
as an example. From the north 
shore of Africa to the Limes in 
West Germany and to the “Wall” 
in England, there was (approxi- 
mately) one set of laws. There was 
one system of measurements. The 
silver denarius and the gold soli- 
dus were accepted all over and 
bought the same goods everywhere, 
except that the big cities were natu- 
rally somewhat more expensive to 
live in. One empire, one law, one 
system of weights and measures, 
one coinage. If they had progressed 
to postage stamps, then it would 
also have been the same. But one 
language? Don’t be silly. 

The Egyptians spoke Egyptian 
and the Greeks spoke Greek. Pal- 
estine spoke Hebrew and Aramaic. 
The Germanic tribes growled their 
own dialects, and while I don’t 
know what was spoken on the Iber- 
ian peninsula, I am certain that it 
was not Latin. The upper crust of 
the Empire, in Rome itself, spoke 
—Greek! After all, one couldn’t just 
FOR YOUR INFORM AT ION 

J I 



talk Latin like any gladiator in the 
arena! 

11/r AYBE it is the example of the 
^ Roman Empire that gave us 
a poor start. But what might have 
happened if the Roman Empire 
had continued? Chances are that 
the number of spoken languages 
would not have decreased. But all 
printed matter, all written lan- 
guage, would have been reduced 
not to one, but to two, Latin and 
Greek, in the confines of that imagi- 
nary continued Roman Empire. 
There would have been no reason 
for the Chinese to give up their 
own language(s) and switch to 
Latin and Greek, which probably 
would have seemed insipid and 
lacking in flavor to them. 

India would not have converted 
either. 

The only later empire which 
could match the Roman Imperium 
in area was the one inefficiently 
ruled by the Czar of all the Rus- 
sias. All the Russians spoke Rus- 
sian, to be sure, but that does not 
mean that the Russian Empire did. 
To begin with, the Ukrainians had 
their own version of Russian which, 
in their opinion, was far superior. 
The Polish section of the Russian 
Empire spoke Polish. The Cau- 
casus had its own language. And 
virtually every place else. And in 
the capital of the empire, St. Peters- 
burg, you did not climb very high 
if, in addition to impeccable Rus- 



102 



103 



sian (with St. Petersburg pronun- 
ciation, substituting a “V” for an 
“L” whenever possible), you did 
not speak equally impeccable 
French and German. 

But now times have changed. 
People travel more. We have rapid 
communications. And all of the 
North American continent speaks 
the same language with the excep- 
tion of Mexico and the French sec- 
tion of Canada, comparatively 
small areas compared to the whole. 

Correct. 

I am the first to acknowledge 
that this is so. But that is no reason 
for “extrapolating” an English- 
speaking Earth. At this moment 
probably more people speak Eng- 
lish than speak Russian, but both 
together do not even match the 
number of people who speak Chi- 
nese. 

And in spite of much and easy 
travel and rapid communications, 
the number of languages has ac- 
tually increased. Maybe it would 
have been easier for the Republic 
of Eire to continue to speak Eng- 
lish. For strong psychological rea- 
sons, they elected not to do so. 
Weird as it may sound, if “sim- 
plicity” alone counted, the lan- 
guage of Israel should be German. 
Many thousands of the immigrants 
spoke German since birth and 
many thousands more spoke the 
closely related Yiddish. But ob- 
viously the adoption of German as 
the official language was an im- 



possibility for Israel, and Hebrew 
is now back as a living tongue. 

At this point somebody is like- 
ly to repeat a reasoning that has 
been offered before. People are 
evidently reluctant to give up their 
own language in favor of somebody 
else’s. There should be no such 
psychological objection to a lan- 
guage which is not somebody else’s 
language, though, but one which 
has been constructed for the pur- 
pose. 

J . M. SCHLEYER thought so in 

1880 and published a “uni- j 
versal language” called Volapiik. 

It died around 1890. In 1897 L .L, . 
Zamenhof published another one j 
called Esperanto. Twenty years ‘ 
later Louis de Beaufront published , 
an improved version of Esperanto j 
which was called Ido. Of these 
early attempts — no Esperantist J 
would admit, of course, that Ido 1 
was an “improved” Esperanto — 1 
only Esperanto had some success, j 
The Esperantists themselves say 
that it is spoken by 1,500,000 peo- 
ple. 

If I suddenly announced at home 
that I was going to learn Finnish, 
my wife would probably inform me 
that good translations of the Kale- 
vala into other languages are avail- 
able. Some of my friends would 
either keep politely quiet or point 
out that educated Finns are like- 
ly to speak German, English, j 
French or Russian. But if I did 
GALAXY 



learn Finnish, I could still talk to 
three times as many people than 
if I learned Esperanto. (Besides, 
most of them can probably speak 
something else that I can under- 
stand.) 

To put it plainly and simply 
(and at the risk of making a 
few enemies), artificial languages 
do not work. Some twenty years 
ago I started reading a journal in 
Esperanto. I could not finish it; it 
looked and sounded too silly. Very 
recently I thought that linguistics, 
like any other science, must cer- 
tainly have advanced since 1887 
and maybe one of the more re- 
cent creations in this field would be 
better. 

I read through the “vocabulary” 
of Basic English. If I had to ex- 
press myself in that vocabulary, 
I’d be a wreck because of frustra- 
tion. (After that, using Basic Eng- 
lish, I could not even say that I 
was a wreck. That word is missing 
as unimportant.) Ah, now, maybe 
I’m just prejudiced. We have, for 
scientific purposes, the new cre- 
ation of Interlingua which is ad- 
vertised as follows: “You can read 
Interlingua if you had no more 
than one semester of high school 
French or Spanish or Latin and 
flunked it.” After due consideration 
I would reword this as reading that 
you can read Interlingua ONLY 
if you flunked. If you didn’t you 
get a toothache first. 

Let me prove that. In an issue of 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



Science News Letter which is ly- 
ing around on my desk there is one 
page of Interlingua. It begins with 
a section on Physica Atomic. My 
eyes already hurt. If you have 
Physica it is darned obvious that 
the second word must be Atomica. 
But no, adding this esthetically ne- 
cessary “a” would be “grammar” 
and that is supposed to frighten 
people. Another paragraph begins 
with the words Le oceanos es vaste 
reservoirs . and my eye is imme- 
diately insulted by having what is 
decidedly a singular article in front 
of a word which is just as decided- 
ly a plural. 

Yes, English does well without 
having a plural article (and Latin 
and Russian manage without any 
articles), but why pick the one 
which everybody knows as the 
French masculine singular article? 
Why not one which is neutral-look- 
ing, if the introduction of a plural 
article is deemed too much? 

Then I read Le Statos Unite ha 
sex submarinos atomic in servicio 
e 27 al teres in preparation. 

This is not a language — this is 
hash! If the six are in servicio, why 
aren’t the other 27 in preparatio? 

T KNOW that the very name 
“United States” offers certain 
linguistic problems, because if we 
want to say that something is of or 
belongs to the United States, we 
have to say that it is “American.” 
And there are, geographically 

105 



104 



speaking, many “Americans” who 
are not of the United States. But I 
find this problem, misleading as it 
might be under certain conditions, 
superior to the Interlingua “solu- 
tion” of talking about the U.S. 
Academy of Sciences as the — be- 
lieve it or not — statounitese Aca- 
demia National de Scientia. 

Since artificial languages are 
likely to be repulsive to the lin- 
guist and won’t be learned by those 
who are not, the artificial language 
is obviously no answer at all. It 
cannot compete with a real lan- 
guage, which may have some diffi- 
culties but makes up for them in 
tradition and versatility and the 
fact that it is alive. A marble statue 
of Miss Universe cannot compete 
with the living original. 

Well, we cannot all agree on 
somebody else’s living language 
and cannot possibly construct a 
satisfactory artificial language, so 
how about a dead language? With 
nobody actually speaking Latin 
nowadays, nobody can have feel- 
ings of jealousy or envy, not for na- 
tionalistic reasons and not for the 
reason once stated by an Austrian 
diplomat to his Russian mistress: 
“You should thank God every 
morning that you grew up speak- 
ing Russian — you don’t have to 
learn it.” 

The only candidate would be 
Latin, since Greek, which might 
otherwise compete, has a different 
alphabet. And for many centuries 
106 



Latin came close to being what is 
called an “international language,” 
one used by many people in many 
nations. I have often wondered why 
Latin came into disuse; it was such 
a simple expedient for internation- 
al science. 

The answer, given by an Eng- 
lish linguist and philosopher whose 
name I can’t remember right now, 
is that Latin, even when it was in 
international use, was just a “male” 
language. 

The man who had just finished 
writing a long letter in Latin to a 
colleague in another country would 
ask his wife in Dutch, French, Ger- 
man or English what they would 
have for supper or whether the 
tailor had delivered his new cloak. 
Likewise he would speak to his 
children (at least to his daughters) 
in their “native” tongue. In other 
words, Latin, while it was in inter- 
national use, but was no longer 
spoken by a people, had acquired 
a certain artificiality. It lacked the 
flaws of the constructed languages, 
yet it was not one in which you 
would argue with your wife about 
the grocery bill. 

Well, what’s the answer? 

I don’t think there is one. Eng- 
lish is doing fine as an “interna- 
tional language” nowadays, and is 
probably doing better than its po- 
litical competitor, Russian, because 
the latter has the handicap of an 
alphabet of its own. But English 
will not replace any other language.

THE EXTINCTION OF 
THE DINOSAURS 

T HE question of why the dino- 
A saurs finally became extinct, af- 
ter having been the ruling group of 
animal life on Earth for more than 
a hundred million years, is about 
as perennial a question as the one 
about the cause of the Ice Age. 

Unfortunately there is no sim- 
ple answer, at least not an answer 
of the type which might be written 
on the back of a postage stamp. It 
is very much a case like that of the 
downfall of the Roman Empire — 
no single cause can be found, but 
you can easily write 500 pages on 
the various causes and reasons 
which for once worked in the same 
direction, instead of canceling each 
other out. 

For certain types of dinosaurs 
and other large reptiles of the past 
— I hope you remember from a for- 
mer column that not every big rep- 
tile which ever lived was a dino- 
saur— the reasons have been known 
for quite some time. The marine 
reptiles, for example, which are col- 
lectively called ichthyosaurs, grad- 
ually shed their teeth; the custom- 
ary explanation is that their main 
food was, or became, soft octopi, 
and that the ichthyosaurs, in order 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



to obtain their food, needed speed 
rather than armament. But then 
other large marine animals came 
into existence — the mosasaurians, 
the ancestors of the whales of to- 
day, and several gigantic sharks — 
which were big, hungry, well- 
toothed and presumably fast 
enough to take off after the ichthyo- 
saurs. 

The extinction of some types of 
land-dwelling dinosaurs has been 
blamed on other much smaller 
saurians who made a diet of the 
eggs of the bigger ones. Finally 
there is the rather generally ac- 
cepted theory of the “heat death.” 

Reptiles can stand cold weather 
fairly well, much better than the 
layman is likely to believe. The 
worst that cold will normally do 
to a reptile is immobilize it. But 
since reptiles have no sweat glands, 
they overheat easily and literally 
die of heat stroke. The desert rep- 
tiles of today are forever burrow- 
ing in the sand or else seeking 
cracks in the rocks. If there is 
enough water around, they simply 
stay in the water, like any contem- 
porary alligator. 

Applied to the dinosaurs, this 
theory of the “heat death” makes 
the Sun responsible for the extinc- 
tion of just the largest types. They 
lived in shallow waters of endless 
marshes and swamps. They moved 
around in forests. If something hap- 
pened that drained the swamps or 
the forests died of drought, the 

107 



enormous reptiles lacked protec- 
tion. They could not burrow in 
sand because of their bulk. They 
could not find cracks in the rock 
large enough to protect them. The 
Sun killed them off. 

1 AM repeating here what I have 
written in the past elsewhere 
because recently two Russian sci- 
entists came up with still another 
theory. It is also a sun which pro- 
fessor Krassovski and Shkevski 
hold responsible for the extinction 
r'f the dinosaurs, but not our sun. 
They blame a star in the vicinity 
of our solar system, a star not more 
than ten or twelve light-years away. 
That star, they theorize, turned into 
a supernova sixty million years ago, 
at the end of the Cretaceous Period. 
The supernova sent incredible 
amounts of hard radiation into 
space, radiation just as nasty as 
that emanating from a nuclear 
bomb explosion. 

Well, if so, why didn’t that radi- 
ation kill off the small mammals 
too? We know they were around 
at the time. In Canada the skeleton 
of an early opossum (hardly dis- 
tinguishable from the current type) 
has been found associated with the 
bones of a large saurian. 

Krassovski and Shkevski an- 
swer that question by saying that 
the radiation from the supernova 
probably was not powerful enough 
after penetrating our atmosphere 
to kill directly. But it was, they 



theorize, powerful enough to cause 
genetic damage. Such damage is 
cumulative. Now small mammals 
like that early opossum, and small ' 
animals in general, like birds, liz- 
ards of assorted sizes and so forth, 
reproduce within a year, counting 
from their own birth. They did not 
have time to accumulate genetic 
damage. 

But the large saurians were 
doomed by their long life span. It 
has been accepted among paleon- 
tologists since the beginning of the 
current century that the full life 
span of one of the large saurians 
like brontosaurus was probably 
about a thousand years. Of course 
we do not know how soon they ma- 
tured sexually, but for an animal 
with a thousand-year life span, sex- 
ual maturity at fifty sounds some- 
what early. Eighty to a hundred 
years is more probable. 

Now, Krassovski and Shkevski 
say, during this long “pre-marital 
period” the dinosaurs accumulated 
so much genetic damage from the 
radiations coming from space that 
their rate of “effective propagation” 
was severely curtailed. The term 
“effective propagation” means pre- 
cisely what it implies. The animals 
presumably mated as frequently as 
had their ancestors before that star 
turned into a supernova. The num- 
ber of eggs they laid was probably 
the same too. But the number of 
offspring which was capable of 
propagating in turn was not. 

GALAXY 



I offer this theory as a fascinat- 
ing idea. I don’t know whether it 
is right or wrong. In fact, I don’t 
know whether we know enough yet 
about radiation-induced genetic 
damage to be able to say that things 
could have worked that way. But 
it is an idea which should be kept 
in mind for later reference. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

The Other End of 
the Flashlight Beam. 

T> OTH in print as well as in pri- 
vate, I have been moaning that 
I rarely get a question that has not 
been asked a dozen times before. 
(About 80 per cent of the letters 
still deal with the paradoxes of 
the theory of relativity and I am 
most thoroughly tired of them.) 
Well, I did get a new one from a 
gentleman in Washington whose 
name I shall not mention because 
he did not state that I could print 
it. 

At any event, this is the ques- 
tion. Supposing somebody shines 
a flashlight into the sky in the di- 
rection of a star which is several 
light-years away. The man with the 
flashlight waits until his light beam 
gets there; we’ll assume that the 
batteries last long enough and we’ll 
also forget about the fact that the 
Earth turns. When the beam does 
get there, the flashlight wielder 
moves the flashlight and directs it 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



at another star, same distance from 
the Earth, but several light-years 
away from the first star. 

What happens to the other end 
of the beam? It cannot possibly 
travel over several light-years in 
half a second. My correspondent 
closed with the remark, “What have 
I forgotten?” 

I told him by mail that he for- 
got a light beam is not a steel rod. 
When the “originating end” on 
Earth is shifted, the “terminating 
end” does not have to follow. But 
I think, as I also wrote to my cor- 
respondent, that the problem is 
easier to understand if he does not 
think of a flashlight but of a ma- 
chine gun with infinite range. It 
is quite obvious that the bullets, 
once they have left the muzzle, will 
continue to travel in the direction 
in which they were originally 
aimed. If, at a later time, you raise 
or traverse the barrel of the ma- 
chine gun, the bullets still to be 
fired will travel in the new direc- 
tion. 

An Overlooked Danger 
of Space Travel? 

JR EADER N. A. Paige of Toron- 
to, Ontario, writes that he 
hopes this is a new question and 
then goes on: “I have an idea that 
one of the extreme dangers the 
first man in space will face will be 
that of nausea with vomiting while 
in a spacesuit and under free-fall 



108 



109 



conditions. It seems likely that, 
without gravity to help him, an in- 
dividual would drown in his own 
juices very rapidly.” 

Well, this is not a question which 
can be answered yes or no. It is a 
rather complicated question, in 
fact, and I am .fortunate that the 
medical branch of the U. S. Air 
Force recently published a report 
which provides some information 
along these lines. 

To begin with, weightlessness 
(over the short periods that can be 
produced in airplane flights: about 
half a minute) has not by itself 
caused nausea. Secondly, if a man 
vomits when weightless, the mat- 
ter is rather forcibly ejected, but 
of course it would cause trouble if 
it were caught by the face plate 
of a space helmet. 

Now the answer to this one is 
that spacemen will not wear suit 
and helmet (at least not a closed 
helmet) inside the ship, just as sub- 
mariners do not wear a diving suit. 
At the same time, it must be ad- 
mitted that the first astronauts in 
orbit probably will wear a pres- 
sure suit just in case something goes 
wrong. I do not know whether this 
has been decided yet. One might 
argue that if something does go 
wrong, it will be so thorough that 
a spacesuit won’t help. 

The Air Force studies dealt 
with the problem of eating and 
drinking while weightless. As was 
to be expected, it proved impos- 

110 



sible to drink from a glass. The j 
test subjects not only splashed ■ 
water all over themselves, they also ' 
“inhaled” it into the nasal passages ’’ 
and complained that they felt as 
if they were drowning. One man 
even managed to get his sinuses 
drowned. I can’t quite figure out 
how he did that, but if the medical 
researchers say he did, I simply 
have to take their word for it. 

Drinking through a straw should 
work, but those who tried it made 
almost as bad a mess of it as they 
did with an open container. I can 
only conclude that this takes a lit- 
tle practice, and thirty seconds of 
weightlessness is not long enough 
to acquire practice. 

What did work was to squirt the 
liquid into the mouth from a plas- 
tic bottle. These experiments did 
not teach the most elegant way of 
drinking while under zero-g, but 
they did show that it could be done. 

The next problem was eating. 
There weightlessness displayed a 
lot of nasty tricks. For example, if 
the man bit into a cracker or a bis- 
cuit, the dry fragments, being 
weightless, managed to float up 
into the nasal passages, which is 
one of the most unpleasant sensa- 
tions a person can have. But eating 
under zero-g worked fine as long as 
whatever was eaten was somewhat 
moist or had a pasty consistency. 

In other words, what was eaten 
had to be of such a nature that it 
did not crumble but held together. 

GALAXY 



But now, as Professor Ehrenhaft 
used to say, comes the moment 
where the frog into the water 
jumps. Several test subjects, imme- 
diately after drinking (water only), 
did vomit. A few people will say 
that this was due to the fact that 
they had been given water to drink, 
but the medical researchers do not 
agree with this hypothesis. They 
don’t know just what caused it. The 
men to whom it happened claimed 
unanimously that they vomited be- 
cause they leaned against the 
(rather tight) seat belt. 

To go back to the original let- 
ter: no case has occurred where 
weightlessness brought on vomit- 
ing all by itself, but after drinking 
it did occur, presumably because 
of a constricting seat belt. But it is 
now known that there is a certain 
danger factor and further studies 
are no doubt under way. 

The Australian Shoe 
Size Puzzle. 

T'HE only feature which brought 
more mail in the history of this 
column than the one on the shoe 
size puzzle was the one, way back, 
on prime numbers. Of course I 
knew the explanation as I wrote it, 
but I did not mention it on pur- 
pose. I wanted to see how many 
readers could puzzle it out. A few 
did, but I got other mail too. 

If you remember, the example 
used dealt with a “Miss S,” age 30, 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



shoe size 5. No Miss S of the given 
age and size wrote in directly to 
ask whether I had been speaking 
about her, but two ladies got males 
to write in and ask this question. I 
don’t recall ever having met either 
of them, but in one case “Miss S” 
was Sylvia Cohn and in the other 
case “Miss S” was Carolyn Sonder- 
berg, both of whom herewith re- 
ceive mention and the assurance 
that they are not the “real” Miss S. 

One young lady in San Antonio, 
Texas (wrong age, wrong size and 
no capital S to her name), startled 
me by stating that the arith- 
metic seemed to miscarry in her 
case. She always came out a year 
older than she actually is, which in- 
cidentally won’t matter in her case 
for many years to come. I went 
over the figures twice and found 
that she was right — she did come 
out one year too old. Fortunately 
she had given me all the particulars 
in her letter, and after a while it 
dawned on me that she had been 
born in December. Yes, if you are 
born at the tail end of a year, you’ll 
come out one year too old; you 
have to assume that your birthday 
is already past on the day when 
you do your private arithmetic. 

Another aspect that had not oc- 
curred to me was pointed out by 
First Lieutenant David R. Barr of 
the U. S. Air Force. To quote his 
letter: “Let z be the shoe size and 
let x be the largest integer less than 
or equal to z; then z = x-\-y, where 

111 



y is either zero or V 2 . After 
doubling z. Miss S. will obtain 
2z = 2x + 2y where 2y must be 
either zero or one. If 2z is even, 
then 2y is zero, and Miss S leaves 
it alone; if 2z is odd, then 2y is one 
and Miss S subtracts one. In either 
case, she is looking at the number 
2x when this step is completed. 
The addition of 39 and the subse- 
quent multiplication by 5 yields 
(2x + 39) • 5 = lOx + 195. 
When Miss S tacks a nine onto it, 
like another digit, she is, in effect, 
multiplying by ten and adding nine. 
This will give her lOOx + 1959. 
The subtraction of the year of her 
birth will yield lOOx plus age, pro- 
vided Miss S is less than 100 years 
old.” 

Well, this is the explanation, of 
course, but I had never thought of 
the provision which I have put in 
italics. If Miss S were 130 years 
old and still wore a size 5, the re- 
sult would be 630 instead of the 
530 to be expected otherwise. The 
puzzle turns out to be rather po- 
lite — it will still insist that the age 
is 30, but merely increase the shoe 
size by one. 

The Hairs on Your Head. 

S INCE the' shoe size puzzle 
found such a response, I yield 
to the temptation to add one more 
of the same type. Supposing you 
live in a town which has 220,000 
inhabitants, or any number larger 



than that. Now you pick your favor- 
ite girl (or yourself, if you are a 
girl) and carefully count the hairs 
on her (or your) head. 

What is the probability that 
there is another girl in the same 
town who, at that moment, has the 
identical number of hairs on her 




head? 

I’ll just add one word of expla- 
nation, the reason for specifying 
“girl.” It is quite simple; in the case 
of a man, there could always be an 
argument of where, near the tem- 
ples, the “hair” stops and the 
“beard” begins. 



“New” Invention. 



By ZENNA HENDERSON 




N O, this is not in reply to any 
question. I just feel like add- 
ing it. 

In one of the German magazines 
I read an interesting ad about a new 
type of shower. To invigorate your 
skin, it says, the shower will inter- 
sperse the temperature for which 
you have adjusted it with “sharp 
stinging sprays of ice cold water.” 
Interesting. 

But my own shower has been do- 
ing that for years, acting on the ran- 
dom hot-water use on the lower 
floor of my house by my wife, two 
daughters and, occasionally, the 
maid. Any time the manufacturer 
of that new type of shower wants 
a strongly negative testimonial, he 
has only to ask for it.

of the world? Maybe not. Maybe 
it’s like asking do you remember 
the Dark Ages. Except what would

the Dark Ages? I knew plenty 
about prices in the Depression. 

If you had a quarter — first find 
your quarter — and five hungry 
kids, you could supper them on two 
cans of soup and a loaf of day-old 
bread, or two quarts of milk and 
a loaf of day-old bread. It was fill- 



112 



113 



ing and — in an after-thoughty kind 
of way — nourishing. But if you 
were one of the hungry five, you 
eventually began to feel erosion 
set in, and your teeth ached for 
substance. 

But to go back to eggs. Those 
were a precious commodity. You 
savored them slowly or gulped 
them eagerly — unmistakably as 
eggs — boiled or fried. That’s one 
reason why I remember Mrs. Klev- 
ity. She had eggs for breakfast! And 
every day! That’s one reason why 
I remember Mrs. Klevity. 

I didn’t know about the eggs the 
time she came over to see Mom, 
who had just got home from a 
twelve-hour day, cleaning up after 
other people at thirty cents an 
hour. Mrs. Klevity lived in the 
same court as we did. Courtesy 
called it a court because we were 
all dependent on the same shower 
house and two toilets that occu- 
pied the shack square in the middle 
of the court. 

All of us except the Big House, 
of course. It had a bathroom of its 
own and even a radio blaring No- 
body’s Business and Should I Re- 
veal and had ceiling lights that 
didn’t dangle nakedly at the end 
of a cord. But then it really wasn’t 
a part of the court. Only its back 
door shared our area, and even that 
was different. It had two back 
doors in the same frame — a screen 
one and a wooden one! 

Our own two-room place had a 



distinction, too. It had an upstairs. 
One room the size of our two. The 
Man Upstairs lived up there. He 
was mostly only the sound of foot- 
steps overhead and an occasional 
cookie for Danna. 

A NYWAY, Mrs. Klevity came 
over before Mom had time to 
put her shopping bag of work 
clothes down or even to unpleat 
the folds of fatigue that dragged 
her face down ten years or more of 
time to come. I didn’t much like 
Mrs. Klevity. She made me un- 
comfortable. She was so solid and 
slow-moving and so nearly blind 
that she peered frighteningly wher- 
ever she went. She stood in the 
doorway as though she had been 
stacked there like bricks and a 
dress drawn hastily down over the 
stack and a face sketched on be- 
neath a fuzz of hair. Us kids all 
gathered around to watch, except 
Danna who snuffled wearily into 
my neck. Day nursery or not, it 
was a long, hard day for a four- 
year-old. 

“I wondered if one of your girls 
could sleep at my house this week.” 
Her voice was as slow as her steps. 

“At your house?” Mom mas- 
saged her hand where the shop- 
ping-bag handles had crisscrossed 
it. “Come in. Sit down.” We had 
two chairs and a bench and two 
apple boxes. The boxes scratched 
bare legs, but surely they couldn’t 
scratch a stack of bricks.

“No, thanks.” Maybe she couldn’t 
bend! “My husband will be away 
several days and I don’t like to be 
in the house alone at night.” 

“Of course,” said Mom. “You 
must feel awfully alone.” 

The only aloneness she knew, 
what with five kids and two rooms, 
was the taut secretness of her in- 
ward thoughts as she mopped and 
swept and ironed in other houses. 
“Sure, one of the girls would be 
glad to keep you company.” There 
was a darting squirm and LaNell 
was safely hidden behind the sway- 
ing of our clothes in the diagonally 
curtained corner of the Other room, 
and Kathy knelt swiftly just be- 
yond the dresser, out of sight. 

“Anna is eleven.” I had no place 
to hide, burdened as I was with 
Danna. “She’s old enough. What 
time do you want her to come 
over?” 

“Oh, bedtime will do.” Mrs. 
Klevity peered out the door at the 
darkening sky. “Nine o’clock. Only 
it gets dark before then—” Bricks 
can look anxious, I guess. 

“As soon as she has supper, she 
can come,” said Mom, handling my 
hours as though they had no value 
to me. “Of course she has to go to 
school tomorrow.” 

“Only when it’s dark,” said Mrs. 
Klevity. “Day is all right. How 
much should I pay you?” 

“Pay?” Mom gestured with one 
hand. “She has to sleep anyway. It 
doesn’t matter to her where, once 
SOMETHING BRIGHT 



she’s asleep. A favor for a friend.” 
I wanted to cry out: whose favor 
for what friend? We hardly passed 
the time of day with Mrs. Klevity. 
I couldn’t even remember Mr. 
Klevity except that he was straight 
and old and wrinkled. Uproot me 
and make me lie in a strange house, 
a strange dark, listening to a 
strange breathing, feeling a strange 
warmth making itself part of me 
for all night long, seeping into 
me . 

“Mom—” I said. 

“I’ll give her breakfast,” said 
Mrs. Klevity. “And lunch money 
for each night she comes.” 

I resigned myself without a 
struggle. Lunch money each day — 
a whole dime! Mom couldn’t af- 
ford to pass up such a blessing, such 
a gift from God, who unerringly 
could be trusted to ease the pinch 
just before it became intolerable. 

“Thank you, God,” I whispered 
as I went to get the can opener to 
open supper. For a night or two I 
could stand it. 

J FELT all naked and unpro- 
tected as I stood in my flimsy 
crinkle cotton pajamas, one bare 
foot atop the other, waiting for Mrs. 
Klevity to turn the bed down. 

“We have to check the house 
first,” she said thickly. ‘We can’t 
go to bed until we check the house.” 
Check the house?” I forgot my 
starchy stiff shyness enough to 
question. “What for?”

Mrs. Klevity peered at me in the 
dim light of the bedroom. They 
had three rooms for only the two of 
them! Even if there was no door 
to shut between the bedroom and 
the kitchen. 

“I couldn’t sleep,” she said, “un- 
less I looked first. I have to.” 

So we looked. Behind the closet 
curtain, under the table — Mrs. 
Klevity even looked in the portable 
oven that sat near the two-burner 
stove in the kitchen. 

When we came to the bed, I was 
moved to words again. “But we’ve 
been in here with the doors locked 
ever since I got here. What could 
possibly—” 

“A prowler?” said Mrs. Klevity 
nervously, after a brief pause for 
thought. “A criminal?” 

Mrs. Klevity pointed her face 
at me. I doubt if she could see me 
from that distance. “Doors make 
no difference,” she said. “It might 
be when you least expect, so you 
have to expect all the time.” 

“I’ll look,” I said humbly. She 
was older than Mom. She was near- 
ly blind. She was one of God’s Also 
Unto Me’s. 

“No,” she said. “I have to. I 
couldn’t be sure, else.” 

So I waited until she grunted and 
groaned to her knees, then bent 
stiffly to lift the limp spread. Her 
fingers hesitated briefly, then 
flicked the spread up. Her breath 
came out flat and finished. Almost 
disappointed, it seemed to me.

She turned the bed down and I 
crept across the gray, wrinkled 
sheets and, turning my back to the 
room, I huddled one ear on the 
flat tobacco-smelling pillow and lay 
tense and uncomfortable in th e 
dark, as her weight shaped and re- 
shaped the bed around me. There 
was a brief silence before I heard 
the soundless breathy shape of her 
words, “How long, O God, how 
long?” 

I wondered through my auto- 
matic Bless Papa and Mama — and 
the automatic back-up because 
Papa had abdicated from my speci- 
fic prayers — bless Mama and my 
brother and sisters — what it was 
that Mrs. Klevity was finding too 
long to bear. 

After a restless waking, dozing 
sort of night that strange sleeping 
places held for me, I awoke to a 
thin, chilly morning and the sound 
of Mrs. Klevity moving around. 
She had set the table for break- 
fast, a formality we never had time 
for at home. I scrambled out of 
bed and into my clothes with only 
my skinny, goosefleshed back be- 
tween Mrs. Klevity and me for 
modesty. I felt uncomfortable and 
unfinished because I hadn’t brought 
our comb over with me. 

I would have preferred to run 
home to our usual breakfast of 
canned milk and shredded wheat, 
but instead I watched, fascinated, 
as Mrs. Klevity struggled with 
lighting the kerosene stove. She

bent so close, peering at the burn- 
ers with the match flaring in her 
hand that I was sure the frousy 
brush of her hair would catch fire, 
but finally the burner caught in- 
stead and she turned her face to- 
ward me. 

“One egg or two?” she asked. 

“Eggs! Two!” Surprise wrung the 
exclamation from me. Her hand 
hesitated over the crumpled brown 
bag on the table. “No, no!” I cor- 
rected her thought hastily. “One. 
One is plenty.” And sat on the edge 
of a chair watching as she broke 
an egg into the sizzling frying pan. 

“Hard or soft?” she asked. 

“Hard,” I said casually, feeling 
very woman-of-the-worldish, din- 
ing out — well, practically — and for 
breakfast, too! I watched Mrs. 
Klevity spoon the fat over the egg, 
her hair swinging stiffly forward 
when she peered. Once it even 
dabbled briefly in the fat, but she 
didn’t notice and, as it swung back, 
it made a little shiny curve on her 
cheek. 

f ? 4 REN’T you afraid of the 
fire?” I asked as she turned 
away from the stove with the fry- 
ing pan. “What if you caught on 
fire?” 

“I did once.” She slid the egg out 
onto my plate. “See?” She brushed 
her hair back on the left side and 
I could see the mottled pucker of 
a large old scar. “It was before I got 
used to Here,” she said, making 



Here more than the house, it 
seemed to me. 

“That’s awful,” I said, hesitating 
with my fork. 

“Go ahead and eat,” she said. 

“ Y our egg will get cold.” She turned 
back to the stove and I hesitated a 
minute more. Meals at a table you 
were supposed to ask a blessing, 
but ... I ducked my head quickly 
and had a mouthful of egg before 
my soundless amen was finished. 

After breakfast I hurried back to 
our house, my lunch-money dime 
clutched securely, my stomach not 
quite sure it liked fried eggs so 
early in the morning. Mom was 
ready to leave, her shopping bag 
in one hand, Danna swinging from 
the other, singing one of her baby 
songs. She liked the day nursery. 

“I won’t be back until late to- 
night,” Mom said. “There’s a quar- 
ter in the corner of the dresser 
drawer. You get supper for the kids 
and try to clean up this messy 
place. We don’t have to be pigs just 
because we live in a place like 
this.” 

“Okay, Mom.” I struggled with 
a snarl in my hair, the pulling mak- 
ing my eyes water. “Where you 
working today?” I spoke over the 
clatter in the other room where the 
kids were getting ready for school. 

She sighed, weary before the day 
began. “I have three places today, 
but the last is Mrs. Paddington.” 
Her face lightened. Mrs. Padding- 
ton sometimes paid a little extra or 
GALAXY 



118 



gave Mom discarded clothes or 
left-over food she didn’t want. She 
was nice. 

“You get along all right with 
Mrs. Klevity?” asked Mom as she 
checked her shopping bag for her 
work shoes. 

“Y eah,” I said. “But she’s funny. 
She looks under the bed before she 
goes to bed.” 

Mom smiled. “I’ve heard of peo- 
ple like that, but it’s usually old 
maids they’re talking about.” 

“But, Mom, nothing coulda got 
in. She locked the door after I got 
there.” 

“People who look under beds 
don’t always think straight,” she 
said. “Besides, maybe she’d like to 
find something under there.” 

“But she’s got a husband,” I cried 
after her as she herded Danna 
across the court. 

“There are other things to look 
for besides husbands,” she called 
back. 

“Anna wants a husband! Anna 
wants a husband!” Deet and La- 
Nell were dancing around me, teas- 
ing me sing-song. Kathy smiled 
slowly behind them. 

“Shut up,” I said. “You don’t 
even know what you’re talking 
about. Go on to school.” 

“It’s too early,” said Deet, dig- 
ging his bare toes in the dust of the 
front yard. “Teacher says we get 
there too early.” 

“Then stay here and start clean- 
ing house,” I said. 

SOMETHING BRIGHT 



They left in a hurry. After they 
were gone, Deet’s feet reminded 
me I’d better wash my own feet 
before I went to school. So I got a 
washpan of water from the tap in 
the middle of the court and, sitting 
on the side of the bed, I eased my 
feet into the icy water. I scrubbed 
with the hard, gray, abrasive soap 
we used and wiped quickly on the 
tattered towel. I threw the water 
out the door and watched it run 
like dust-covered snakes across the 
hard-packed front yard. 

I went back to put my shoes on 
and get my sweater. I looked at the 
bed. I got down on my stomach and 
peered under. Other things to look 
for. There was the familiar huddle 
of cardboard cartons we kept things 
in and the familiar dust fluffs and 
one green sock LaNell had lost last 
week, but nothing else. 

I dusted my front off. I tied my 
lunch-money dime in the corner 
of a handkerchief and, putting my 
sweater on, left for school. 

PEERED out into the windy 
A wet semi-twilight. “Do I have 
to?” 

“You said you would,” said 
Mom. “Keep your promises. You 
should have gone before this. She’s 
probably been waiting for you.” 

“I wanted to see what you 
brought from Mrs. Paddington’s.” 
LaNell and Kathy were playing in 
the corner with a lavender hug-me- 
tight and a hat with green grapes on

it. Deet was rolling an orange on 
the floor, softening it preliminary 
to poking a hole in it to suck the 
juice out. 

“She cleaned a trunk out today,” 
said Mom. “Mostly old things that 
belonged to her mother, but these 
two coats are nice and heavy. 
They’ll be good covers tonight. It’s 
going to be cold. Someday when I 
get time, I’ll cut them up and make 
quilts.” She sighed. Time was what 
she never had enough of. “Better 
take a newspaper to hold over your 
head.” 

“Oh, Mom!” I huddled into my 
sweater. “It isn’t raining now. I’d 
feel silly!” 

“Well, then, scoot!” she said, her 
hand pressing my shoulder warm- 
ly, briefly. 

I scooted, skimming quickly the 
flood of light from our doorway, 
and splishing through the shallow 
run-off stream that swept across the 
court. There was a sudden wild 
swirl of wind and a vindictive splat- 
ter of heavy, cold raindrops that 
swept me, exhilarated, the rest of 
the way to Mrs. Klevity’s house 
and under the shallow little roof 
that was just big enough to cover 
the back step. I knocked quickly, 
brushing my disordered hair back 
from my eyes. The door swung 
open and I was in the shadowy, 
warm kitchen, almost in Mrs. Klev- 
ity’s arms. 

“Oh!” I backed up, laughing 
breathlessly. “The wind blew—” 



“I was afraid you weren’t com- 
ing.” She turned away to the stove. 
“I fixed some hot cocoa.” 

I sat cuddling the warm cup in 
my hands, savoring the chocolate 
sip by sip. She had made it with 
milk instead of water, and it tasted 
rich and wonderful. But Mrs. Klev- 
ity was sharing my thoughts with 
the cocoa. In that brief moment 
when I had been so close to her, I 
had looked deep into her dim eyes 
and was feeling a vast astonish- 
ment. The dimness was only on top. 
Underneath — underneath — 

I took another sip of cocoa. Her 
eyes — almost I could have walked 
into them, it seemed like. Slip past 
the gray film, run down the shiny 
bright corridor, into the live young 
sparkle at the far end. 

I looked deep into my cup of 
cocoa. Were all grownups like that? 
If you could get behind their eyes, 
were they different, too? Behind 
Mom’s eyes, was there a corridor 
leading back to youth and sparkle? 

I finished the cocoa drowsily. It 
was still early, but the rain was 
drumming on the roof and it was 
the kind of night you curl up to if 
you’re warm and fed. Sometimes 
you feel thin and cold on such 
nights, but I was feeling curl-uppy. 
So I groped under the bed for the 
paper bag that had my jammas in 
it. I couldn’t find it. 

“I swept today,” said Mrs. Klev- 
ity, coming back from some far 
country of her thoughts. “I musta

pushed it farther under the bed.” 

I got down on my hands and 
knees and peered under the bed. 
“Ooo!” I said. “What’s shiny?” 

Something snatched me away 
from the bed and flung me to one 
side. By the time I had gathered 
myself up off the floor and was rub- 
bing a banged elbow, Mrs. Klevity’s 
bulk was pressed against the bed, 
her head under it. 

“Hey!” I cried indignantly, and 
then remembered I wasn’t at home. 
I heard an odd whimpering sob 
and then Mrs. Klevity backed slow- 
ly away, still kneeling on the floor. 

“Only the lock on the suitcase,” 
she said. “Here’s your jammas.” 
She handed me the bag and pon- 
derously pulled herself upright 
again. 

We went silently to bed after she 
had limped around and checked 
the house, even under the bed 
again. I heard that odd breathy 
whisper of a prayer and lay awake, 
trying to add up something shiny 
and the odd eyes and the whisper- 
ing sob. Finally I shrugged in the 
dark and wondered what I’d pick 
for funny when I grew up. All 
grownups had some kind of funny. 

HP HE next night Mrs. Klevity 
-*■ couldn’t get down on her knees 
to look under the bed. She’d hurt 
herself when she plumped down on 
the floor after yanking me away 
from the bed. 

“You’ll have to look for me to- 
SOMETHING BRIGHT 



night,” she said slowly, nursing her 
knees. “Look good. Oh, Anna, look 
good!” 

I looked as good as I could, not 
knowing what I was looking for. 

“It should be under the bed,” she 
said, her palms tight on her knees 
as she rocked back and forth. “But 
you can’t be sure. It might miss 
completely.” 

“What might?” I asked, hunker- 
ing down by the bed. 

She turned her face blindly to- 
ward me. “The way out,” she said. 
“The way back again—” 

“Back again?” I pressed my 
cheek to the floor again. “Well, I 
don’t see anything. Only dark and 
suitcases.” 

“Nothing bright? Nothing? Noth- 
ing—” She tried to lay her face on 
her knees, but she was too unbendy 
to manage it, so she put her hands 
over her face instead. Grownups 
aren’t supposed to cry. She didn’t 
quite, but her hands looked wet 
when she reached for the clock to 
wind it. 

I lay in the dark, one strand of 
her hair tickling my hand where 
it lay on the pillow. Maybe she was 
crazy. I felt a thrill of terror fan out 
on my spine. I carefully moved my 
hand from under the lock of hair. 
How can you find a way out under 
a bed? I’d be glad when Mr. Klev- 
ity got home, eggs or no eggs, dime 
or no dime. 

Somewhere in the darkness of 
the night, I was suddenly swim- 

121 



ming to wakefulness, not knowing 
what was waking me but feeling 
that Mrs. Klevity was awake too. 

“Anna.” Her voice was small and 
light and silver. “Anna—” 

“Hummm?” I murmured, my 
voice still drowsy. 

“Anna, have you ever been away 
from home?” I turned toward her, 
trying in the dark to make sure it 
was Mrs. Klevity. She sounded so 
different. 

“Yes,” I said. “Once I visited 
Aunt Katie at Rocky Butte for a 
week.” 

“Anna.” I don’t know whether 
she was even hearing my answers; 
her voice was almost a chant 
“Anna, have you ever been in 
prison?” 

“No! Of course not!” I recoiled 
indignantly. “You have to be aw- 
fully bad to be in prison.” 

“Oh, no. Oh, no!” she sighed. 
“Not jail, Anna. Prison, prison. The 
weight of the flesh — bound 
about—” 

“Oh,” I said, smoothing my 
hands across my eyes. She was 
talking to a something deep in 
me that never got talked to, that 
hardly even had words. “Like when 
the wind blows the clouds across 
the moon and the grass whispers 
along the road and all the trees 
pull like balloons at their trunks 
and one star comes out and says 
‘Come’ and the ground says ‘Stay 5 
and part of you tries to go and it 
hurts—” I could feel the slender 
roundness of my ribs under my 

122 



pressing hands. “And it hurts—” 

“Oh, Anna, Anna!” The soft, 
light voice broke. “You feel that 
way and you belong Here. You 
won’t ever—” 

The voice stopped and Mrs. 
Klevity rolled over. Her next 
words came thickly, as though a 
gray film were over them as over 
her eyes. “Are you awake, Anna? 
Go to sleep, child. Morning isn’t 
yet.” 

I heard the heavy sigh of her 
breathing as she slept. And final- 
ly I slept too, trying to visualize 
what Mrs. Klevity would look like 
if she looked like the silvery voice- 
in-the-dark. 

SAT savoring my egg the next 
morning, letting thoughts slip 
in and out of my mind to the 
rhythm of my jaws. What a funny 
dream to have, to talk with a sil- 
ver-voiced someone. To talk about 
the way blowing clouds and windy 
moonlight felt. But it wasn’t a 
dream! I paused with my fork 
raised. At least not my dream. But 
how can you tell? If you’re part of 
someone else’s dream, can it still 
be real for you? 

“Is something wrong with the 
egg?” Mrs. Klevity peered at me. 

“No — no — ” I said, hastily 
snatching the bite on my fork. 
“Mrs. Klevity—” 

“Yes.” Her voice was thick and 
heavy-footed. 

“Why did you ask me about be- 
ing in prison?” 



GALAXY 



“Prison?” Mrs. Klevity blinked 
blindly. “Did I ask you about 
prison?” 

“Someone did — I thought — ” I 
faltered, shyness shutting down on 
me again. 

“Dreams.” Mrs. Klevity stacked 
her knife and fork on her plate. 
“Dreams.” 

I wasn’t quite sure I was to be at 
Klevity’s the next evening. Mr. 
Klevity was supposed to get back 
sometime during the evening. But 
Mrs. Klevity welcomed me. 

“Don’t know when he’ll get 
home,” she said. “Maybe not until 
morning. If he comes early, you 
can go home to sleep and I’ll give 
you your dime anyway.” 

“Oh, no,” I said, Mom’s teach- 
ings solidly behind me. “I couldn’t 
take it if I didn’t stay.” 

“A gift,” said Mrs. Klevity. 

We sat opposite one another 
until the silence stretched too thin 
for me to bear. 

“In olden times,” I said, snatch- 
ing at the magic that drew stories 
from Mom, “when you were a lit- 
tle girl—” 

“When I was a girl—” Mrs. Klev- 
ity rubbed her knees with reflec- 
tive hands. “The other Where. The 
other When.” 

“In olden times,” I persisted, 
“things were different then.” 

“Yes.” I settled down comfort- 
ably, recognizing the reminiscent 
tone of voice. “You do crazy things 
when you are young.” Mrs. Klevity 
leaned heavily on the table. 
SOMETHING BRIGHT 



Things you have no business do ing . 
You volunteer when you’re young.” 
I jerked as she lunged across the 
table and grabbed both my arms. 
“But I am young! Three years isn’t 
an eternity. I am young!” 

I twisted one arm free and pried 
at her steely fingers that clamped 
my other one. 

“Oh.” She let go. “I’m sorry. I 
didn’t mean to hurt you.” 

She pushed back the tousled 
brush of her hair. 

“Look,” she said, her voice was 
almost silver again. “Under all this 
— this grossness, I’m still me. I 
thought I could adjust to anything, 
but I had no idea that they’d put 
me in such—” She tugged at her sag- 
ging dress. “Not the clothes!” she 
cried. “Clothes you can take off. 
But this—” Her fingers dug into her 
heavy shoulder and I could see the 
bulge of flesh between them. 

“If I knew anything about the 
setup maybe I could locate it. 
Maybe I could call. Maybe—” 

Her shoulders sagged and her 
eyelids dropped down over her 
dull eyes. 

“It doesn’t make any sense to 
you,” she said, her voice heavy and 
thick again. “To you I’d be old 
even There. At the time it seemed 
like a perfect way to have an odd 
holiday and help out with research, 
too. But we got caught.” 

CHE began to count her fingers 
^ mumbling to herself. “Three 
years There, but Here that’s — 

123 



eight threes are—” She traced on 
the table with a blunt forefinger, 
her eyes close to the old, wornout 
cloth. 

“Mrs. Klevity,” My voice scared 
me in the silence, but I was feel- 
ing the same sort of upsurge that 
catches you sometimes when 
you’re playing-like and it gets so 
real. “Mrs. Klevity, if you’ve lost 
something, maybe I could look for 
it for you.” 

“You didn’t find it last night,” 
she said. 

“Find what?” 

She lumbered to her feet. “Let’s 
look again. Everywhere. They’d 
surely be able to locate the house.” 
“What are we looking for?” I 
asked, searching the portable oven. 

“You’ll know it when we see 
it,” she said. 

And we searched the whole 
house. Oh, such nice things! Blan- 
kets, not tattered and worn, and 
even an extra one they didn’t need. 
And towels with wash rags that 
matched — and weren't rags. And 
uncracked dishes that matched! 
And glasses that weren’t jars. And 
books. And money. Crisp new- 
looking bills in the little box in the 
bottom drawer — pushed back un- 
der some extra pillow cases. And 
clothes — lots and lots of clothes. 
All too big for any of us, of course, 
but my practiced eye had already 
visualized this, that and the other 
cut down to dress us all like rich 
people. 

124 



I sighed as we sat wearily look- 
ing at one another. Imagine having 
so much and still looking for some- 
thing else! It was bedtime and all 
we had for our pains were dirty 
hands and tired backs. 

I scooted out to the bath house 
before I undressed. I gingerly 
washed the dirt off my hands un- 
der the cold of the shower and 
shook them dry on the way back to 
the house. Well, we had moved 
everything in the place, but noth- 
ing was what Mrs. Klevity looked 
for. 

Back in the bedroom, I groped 
under the bed for my jammas and 
again had to lie flat and burrow 
under the bed for the tattered bag. 
Our moving around had wedged 
it back between two cardboard car- 
tons. I squirmed under farther and 
tried to ease it out after shoving the 
two cartons a little farther apart. 
The bag tore, spilling out my jam- 
mas, so I grasped them in the bend 
of my elbow and started to back 
out. 

Then the whole world seemed to 
explode into brightness that pul- 
sated and dazzled, that splashed 
brilliance into my astonished eyes 
until I winced them shut to rest 
their seeing and saw the dark in- 
versions of the radiance behind my 
eyelids. 

I forced my eyes open again 
and looked sideways so the edge 
of my seeing was all I used until 
I got more accustomed to the glory. 

GALAXY 



1 

Between the two cartons was an 
opening like a window would be, 
but little, little, into a wonderland 
of things I could never tell. Colors 
that had no names. Feelings that 
made windy moonlight a puddle of 
dust. I felt tears burn out of my 
eyes and start down my cheeks, 
whether from brightness or wonder, 
I don’t know. I blinked them away 
and looked again. 

Someone was in the brightness, 
several someones. They were lean- 
ing out of the squareness, beckon- 
ing and calling — silver signals and 
silver sounds. 

“Mrs. Klevity,” I thought. 
“Something bright.” 

I took another good look at the 
shining people and the tree things 
that were like music bordering a 
road, and grass that was the song 
my evening grass hummed in the 
wind — a last, last look, and began 
to back out. 

I scrambled to my feet, clutch- 
ing my jammas. “Mrs. Klevity.” 
She was still sitting at the table, as 
solid as a pile of bricks, the 
sketched face under the wild hair 
a sad, sad one. 

“Yes, child.” She hardly heard 
herself. 

“Something bright ...” I said. 

XTER heavy head lifted slowly, 
her blind face turned to me. 
“What, child?” 

I felt my fingers bite into my 
jammas and the cords in my 
SOMETHING BRIGHT 



neck getting tight and my stom- 
ach clenching itself. “Something 
bright!” I thought I screamed. She 
didn’t move. I grabbed her arm and 
dragged her off-balance in her 
chair. “Something bright!” 

“Anna.” She righted herself on 
the chair. “Don’t be mean.” 

I grabbed the bedspread and 
yanked it up. The light sprayed out 
like a sprinkler on a lawn. 

Then she screamed. She put both 
hands up to her heavy face and 
screamed, “Leolienn! It’s here! 
Hurry, hurry!” 

“Mr. Klevity isn’t here,” I said. 
“He hasn’t got back.” 

“I can’t go without him! Leo- 
lienn!” 

“Leave a note!” I cried. “If 
you’re there, you can make them 
come back again and I can show 
him the right place!” The upsurge 
had passed make-believe and 
everything was realer than real. 

Then, quicker than I ever 
thought she could move, she got 
paper and a pencil. She was scrib- 
bling away at the table as I stood 
there holding the spread. So I 
dropped to my knees and then to 
my stomach and crawled under the 
bed again. I filled my eyes with the 
brightness and beauty and saw, 
beyond it, serenity and orderliness 
and — and uncluttered cleanness. 
The miniature landscape was like 
a stage setting for a fairy tale — 
so small, so small — so lovely. 

And then Mrs. Klevity tugged at 

125 



my ankle and I slid out, reluctant- 
ly, stretching my sight of the bright 
square until the falling of the 
spread broke it. Mrs. Klevity 
worked her way under the bed, her 
breath coming pantingly, her big, 
ungainly body inching along awk- 
wardly. 

She crawled and crawled and 
crawled until she should have come 
up short against the wall, and I 
knew she must be funneling down 
into the brightness, her face, head 
and shoulders, so small, so lovely, 
like her silvery voice. But the rest 
of her, still gross and ugly, like a 
butterfly trying to skin out of its 
cocoon. 

Finally only her feet were stick- 
ing out from under the bed and 
they thrashed and waved and didn’t 
go anywhere, so I got down on the 
floor and put my feet against hers 
and braced myself against the 
dresser and pushed. And pushed 
and pushed. Suddenly there was a 
going, a finishing, and my feet 
dropped to the floor. 

There, almost under the bed, lay 
Mrs. Klevity’s shabby old-lady 
black shoes, toes pointing away 
from each other. I picked them up 
in my hands, wanting, somehow, to 
cry. Her saggy lisle stockings were 
still in the shoes. 

Slowly I pulled all of the clothes 
of Mrs. Klevity out from under the 
bed. They were held together by a 
thin skin, a sloughed-off leftover of 
Mrs. Klevity that only showed, 



gray and lifeless, where her bare 
hands and face would have been, 
and her dull gray filmed eyes. 

I let it crumple to the floor and 
sat there, holding one of her old 
shoes in my hand. 

The door rattled and it was gray, 
old, wrinkled Mr. Klevity. 

“Hello, child,” he said. “Where’s 
my wife?” 

“She’s gone,” I said, not looking 
at him. “She left you a note there 
on the table.” 

“Gone—?” He left the word 
stranded in mid-air as he read Mrs. 
Klevity’s note. 

r T , HE paper fluttered down. He 
yanked a dresser drawer open 
and snatched out spool-looking 
things, both hands full. Then he 
practically dived under the bed, 
his elbows thudding on the floor, 
to-hurt hard. And there was only 
a wiggle or two and his shoes 
slumped away from each other. 

I pulled his cast-aside from un- 
der the bed and crawled under it 
myself. I saw the tiny picture frame 
— bright, bright, but so small. 

I crept close to it, knowing I 
couldn’t go in. I saw the tiny per- 
fection of the road, the landscape, 
the people — the laughing people 
who crowded around the two new 
rejoicing figures — the two silvery, 
lovely young creatures who cried 
out in tiny voices as they danced. 
The girl-one threw a kiss outward 
before they all turned away and

ran up the winding white road to- 
gether. 

The frame began to shrink, fas- 
ter, faster, until it squeezed to a 
single bright bead and then blinked 
out. 

All at once the house was empty 
and cold. The upsurge was gone. 
Nothing was real any more. All 
at once the faint ghost of the smell 
of eggs was frightening. All at once 
I whimpered, “My lunch money!” 

I scrambled to my feet, tum- 
bling Mrs. Klevity’s clothes into a 
disconnected pile. I gathered up 
my jammas and leaned across the 
table to get my sweater. I saw my 
name on a piece of paper. I picked 
it up and read it. 

Everything that is ours in this house 
now belongs to Anna-across-the-court f 
the little girl that’s been staying with 
me at night. 

Ahvlaree Klevity 

I looked from the paper around 
the room. All for me? All for us? 
All this richness and wonder of 
good things? All this and the box in 
the bottom drawer, too? And a pa- 
per that said so, so that nobody 
could take them away from us. 

A fluttering wonder filled my 
chest and I walked stiffly around 
the three rooms, visualizing every- 
thing without opening a drawer or 
door. I stood by the stove and 
looked at the frying pan hanging 




above it. I opened the cupboard 
door. The paper bag of eggs was on 
the shelf. I reached for it, looking 
back over my shoulder almost 
guiltily. 

The wonder drained out of me 
with a gulp. I ran back over to the 
bed and yanked up the spread. I 
knelt and hammered on the edge 
of the bed with my clenched fists. 
Then I leaned my forehead on my 
tight hands and felt my knuckles 
bruise me. My hands went limply 
to my lap, my head drooping. 

I got up slowly and took the 
paper from the table, bundled my 
jammas under my arm and got the 
eggs from the cupboard. I turned 
the lights out and left. 

I felt tears wash down from my 
eyes as I stumbled across the famil- 
iar yard in the dark. I don’t know 
why I was crying — unless it was 
because I was homesick for some- 
thing bright that I knew I would 
never have, and because I knew I 
could never tell Mom what really 
happened. 

Then the pale trail of light from 
our door caught me and I swept in 
on an astonished Mom, calling soft- 
ly, because of the sleeping kids, 
“Mom! Mom! Guess what!” 

VTES, I remember Mrs. Klevity 
because she had eggs for break- 
fast! Every day! That’s one of the 
reasons I remember her.

CRYING JAG 



By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 



Solitary lushes are not the worst kind. The 
worst are aliens like this— because of what 
they tank up on — and right in public, too! 



Illustrated by WOOD 



I t was Saturday evening and 
I was sitting on the stoop, 
working up a jag. I had my 
jug beside me, handy, and I was 
feeling good and fixing to feel bet- 
ter, when this alien and his robot 
came tramping up the driveway. 

I knew right off it was an alien. 
It looked somethirig like a man, 




but there weren’t any humans got 
robots trailing at their heels. 

If I had been stone sober, I 
might have gagged a bit at the idea 
there was an alien coming up the 
driveway and done some arguing 
with myself. But I wasn’t sober — 
not entirely, that is. 

So I said good evening and asked 
him to sit down and he thanked 
me and sat. 

“You, too,” I said to the robot, 
moving over to make room. 

“Let him stand,” the alien said. 
“He cannot sit. He is a mere 
machine.” 

The robot clanked a gear at him, 
but that was all it said. 

“Have a snort,” I said, picking 
up the jug, but the alien shook 
his head. 

“I wouldn’t dare,” he said. “My 
metabolism.” 

That was one of the double- 
jointed words I had acquaintance 
with. From working at Doc Abel’s 
sanitorium, I had picked up some 
of the medic lingo. 

“That’s a dirty shame,” I said. 
“You don’t mind if I do?” 

“Not at all,” the alien said. 

So I had a long one. I felt the 
need of it 

I put down the jug and wiped 
my mouth and asked him if there 
was something I could get him. It 
seemed plain inhospitable for me 
to be sitting there, lapping up that 
liquor, and him not having any. 

“You can tell me about this 



town,” the alien said. “I think yo u 
call it Millville.” 

“That’s the name, all right. What 
you want to know about it?” 

“All the sad stories,” said the 
robot, finally speaking up. 

“He is correct,” the alien said, 
settling down in an attitude of 
pleasurable anticipation. “Tell me 
about the troubles and the tribu- 
lations.” 

“Starting where?” I asked. 
“How about yourself?” 

“Me? I never have no troubles. 
I janitor all week at the sanitorium 
and I get drunk on Saturday. Then 
I sober up on Sunday so I can 
janitor another week. Believe me, 
mister,” I told him, “I haven’t got 
no troubles. I am sitting pretty. I 
have got it made.” 

“But there must be people . 
“Oh, there are. You never saw 
so much complaining as there is 
in Millville. There ain’t nobody 
here except myself but has got a 
load of trouble. And it wouldn’t 
be so bad if they didn’t talk about 
it” 

“Tell me,” said the alien. 

CO I had another snort and then 
^ I told him about the Widow 
Frye, who lives just up the street. 
I told him how her life had been 
just one long suffering, with her 
husband running out on her when 
their boy was only three years old, 
and how she took in washing and 
worked her fingers to the bone to 



support the two of them, and the 
kid ain’t more than thirteen or 
fourteen when he steals this car 
and gets sent up for two years to 
the boys’ school over at Glen 
Lake. 

“And that is all of it?” asked the 
alien. 

“Well, in rough outline,” I said. 
“I didn’t put in none of the flour- 
ishes nor the grimy details, the 
way the widow would. You should 
hear her tell it.” 

“Could you arrange it?” 

“Arrange what?” 

“To have her tell it to me.” 

“I wouldn’t promise you,” I told 
him honestly. “The window has a 
low opinion of me. She never 
speaks to me.” 

“But I can’t understand.” 

“She is a decent, church-going 
woman,” I explained, “and I am 
just a crummy bum. And I drink.” 
“She doesn’t like drinking?” 

“She thinks it is a sin.” 

The alien sort of shivered. “I 
know. I guess all places are pretty 
much alike.” 

“You have people like the Wid- 
ow Frye?” 

“Not exactly but the attitude’s 
the same.” 

“Well,” I said, after another 
snort, “I figure there is nothing else 
to do but bear up under it.” 

“Would it be too much bother,” 
asked the alien, “to tell me another 
one?” 

“None at all,” I said. 

CRYING JAG 



So I told him about Elmer Trot- 
ter, who worked his way through 
law school up at Madison, doing 
all kinds of odd jobs to earn his 
way, since he had no folks, and 
how he finally got through and 
passed the bar examination, then 
came back to Millville to set up an 
office. 

I couldn’t tell him how it hap- 
pened or why, although I had al- 
ways figured that Elmer had got a 
belly full of poverty and grabbed 
this chance to earn a lot of money 
fast. No one should have known 
better than he did that it was dis- 
honest, being he was a lawyer. But 
he went ahead and did it and he 
got caught. 

“And what happened then?” 
asked the alien breathlessly. “Was 
he punished?” 

I told him how Elmer got dis- 
barred and how Eliza Jenkins gave 
him back his ring and how Elmer 
went into insurance and just 
scraped along in a hand-to-mouth 
existence, eating out his heart to 
be a lawyer once again, but he 
never could. 

“You got all this down?” the 
alien asked the robot. 

“All down,” the robot said. 

“What fine nuances!” exclaimed 
the alien, who seemed to be much 
pleased. “What stark, overpower- 
ing reality!” 

I didn’t know what he was talk- 
ing about, so I had another drink 
instead.

131 



T HEN I went ahead, without 
being asked, and I told him 
about Amanda Robinson and her 
unhappy love affair and how she 
turned into Millville’s most gen- 
teel and sorriest old maid. And 
about Abner Jones and his endless 
disappointments, but his refusal to 
give up the idea that he was a 
great inventor, and how his family 
went in rags and hungry while he 
spent all his time inventing. 

“Such sadness!” said the alien. 
“What a lovely planet!” 

“You better taper off,” the ro- 
bot warned him. “You know what 
happens to you.” 

“Just one more,” the alien 
begged. “I’m all right. Just one 
more.” 

“Now, look here,” I told him, “I 
don’t mind telling them, if that is 
what you want. But maybe first 
you better tell me a bit about 
yourself. I take it you’re an alien.” 
“Naturally,” said the alien. 

“And you came here in a space- 
ship.” 

‘Well, not exactly a spaceship.” 
“Then, if you’re an alien, how 
come you talk so good?” 

“Now, that,” the alien said, “is 
something that still is tender to 
me.” 

The robot said scornfully: 
“They took him good and proper.” 
“Y ou mean you paid for it.” 
“Too much,” the robot said. 
“They saw that he was eager, so 
they hiked the price on him.” 



“But I’ll get even with them,” 
the alien cut in. “If I don’t turn a 

profit on it, my name isn’t » 

And he said a word that was long 
and twisted and didn’t make no 
sense. 

“That your name?” I asked. 

“Yeah, sure. But you can call me 
Wilbur. And the ~ robot, you may 
call him Lester.” 

‘Well, boys,” I said, “I’m mighty 
glad to know you. You can call 
me Sam.” 

And I had another drink. 

We sat there on the stoop and 
the moon was coming up and the 
fireflies were flickering in the li- 
lac hedge and the world had an 
edge on it. I’d never felt so good. 

“Just one more,” said Wilbur 
pleadingly. 

So I told him about some of the 
mental cases up at the sanitarium 
and I picked the bad ones and 
alongside of me Wilbur started 
blubbering and the robot said: 
“Now see what you’ve done. He’s 
got a crying jag.” 

But Wilbur wiped his eyes and 
said it was all right and that if I’d 
just keep on he’d do the best he 
could do get a grip himself. 

“What is going on here?” I asked 
in some astonishment. “You 
sound like you get drunk from 
hearing these sad stories.” 

“That’s what he does,” said Les- 
ter, the robot. ‘Why else do you 
think he’d sit and listen to your 
blabber.” 



132 



GALAXY 



“And you?” I asked of Lester. 
“Of course not,” Wilbur said. 
“He has no emotions. He is a mere 
machine.” 

T HAD another drink and I 
*■ thought it over and it was as 
clear as day. So I told Wilbur my 
philosophy: “This is Saturday 

night and that’s the time to howl. 
So let’s you and I together—” 

“I am with you,” Wilbur cried, 
“as long as you can talk.” 

Lester clanked a gear in what 
must have been disgust, but that 
was all he did. 

“Get down every word of it,” 
Wilbur told the robot. “We’ll make 
ourselves a million. We’ll need it 
to get back all overpayment for 
our indoctrination.” He sighed. 
“Not that it wasn’t worth it. What 
a lovely, melancholy planet.” 

So I got cranked up and kept 
myself well lubricated and the 
night kept getting better every 
blessed minute. 

Along about midnight, I got fall- 
ing-down drunk and Wilbur maud- 
lin drunk and we gave up by a 
sort of mutual consent. We got up 
off the stoop and by bracing one 
another we got inside the door and 
I lost Wilbur somewhere, but 
made it to my bed and that was 
the last I knew. 

When I woke up, I knew it was 
Sunday morning. The sun was 
streaming through the window and 
it was bright and sanctimonious, 



like Sunday always is around here. 

Sundays usually are quiet, and 
that’s one thing wrong with them. 
But this one wasn’t quiet. There 
was an awful din going on outside. 
It sounded like someone was throw- 
ing rocks and hitting a tin can. 

I rolled out of bed and my mouth 
tasted just as bad as I knew it 
would be. I rubbed some of the 
sand out of my eyes and started 
for the living room and just out- 
side the bedroom door I almost 
stepped on Wilbur. 

He gave me quite a start and 
then I remembered who he was 
and I stood there looking at him, 
not quite believing it. I thought at 
first that he might be dead, but I 
saw he wasn’t. He was lying flat 
upon his back and his catfish mouth 
was open and every time he 
breathed the feathery whiskers on 
his lips stood straight out and flut- 
tered. 

I stepped over him and went to 
the door to find out what all the 
racket was. And there stood Les- 
ter, the robot, exactly where we’d 
left him the night before, and out 
in the driveway a bunch of kids 
were pegging rocks at him. Those 
kids were pretty good. They hit 
Lester almost every time. 

I yelled at them and they scat- 
tered down the road. They knew 
I d tan tneir hides. 

I was just turning around to go 
back into the house when a car 
swung into the drive. Joe Fletcher, 



CRYING JAG 



133 



our constable, jumped out and 
came striding toward me and I 
could see that he was in his best 
fire-eating mood. 

J OE stopped in front of the 
stoop and put both hands on 
his hips and stared first at Lester 
and then at me. 

“Sam,” he asked with a nasty 
leer, “what is going on here? Some 
of your pink elephants move into 
live with you?” 

“Joe,” I said solemn, passing up 
the insult, “I’d like you to meet 
Lester.” 

Joe had opened up his mouth 
to yell at me when Wilbur showed 
up at the door. 

“And this is Wilbur,” I said. 
’Wilbur is an alien and Lester is 
a . .” 

‘Wilbur is a what!” roared Joe. 
Wilbur stepped out on the stoop 
and said: “What a sorrowful face. 
And so noble, too!” 

“He means you,” I said to Joe. 
“If you guys keep this up,” Joe 
bellowed, “I’ll run in the bunch 
of you.” 

“I meant no harm,” said Wilbur. 
“I apologize if I have bruised your 
sensitivities.” 

That was a hot one — Joe’s 
sensitivities! 

“I can see at a glance,” said 
Wilbur, “that life’s not been easy 
for you.” 

“I’ll tell the world it ain’t,” Joe 
said. 



“Nor for me,” said Wilbur, sit- 
ting down upon the stoop. “It 
seems that there are days a man 
can’t lay away a dime.” 

“Mister, you are right,” said 
Joe. “Just like I was telling the 
missus this morning when she up 
and told me that the kids needed 
some new shoes . .” 

“It does beat hell how a man 
can’t get ahead.” 

“Listen, you ain’t heard nothing 
yet . .” 

And so help me Hannah, Joe 
sat down beside him and before 
you could count to three started 
telling his life story. 

“Lester,” Wilbur said, “be sure 
you get this down.” 

I beat it back into the house and 
had a quick one to settle my stom- 
ach before I tackled breakfast. 

I didn’t feel like eating, but I 
knew I had to. I got out some eggs 
and bacon and wondered what I 
would feed Wilbur. For I sud- 
denly remembered how his met- 
abolism couldn’t stand liquor, and 
if it couldn’t take good whisky, 
there seemed very little chance 
that it would take eggs and bacon. 

A S I was finishing my breakfast, 
Higman Morris came busting 
through the back door and straight 
into the kitchen. Higgy is our 
mayor, a pillar of the church, a 
member of the school board and a 
director of the bank, and he is a 
big stuffed shirt. 



“Sam,” he yelled at me, “this 
town has taken a lot from you. We 
have put up with your drinking 
and your general shiftlessness and 
your lack of public spirit. But this 
is too much!” 

I wiped some egg off my chin. 
“What is too much?” 

Higgy almost strangled, he was 
so irritated. “This public exhibi- 
tion. This three-ring circus! This 
nuisance! And on a Sunday, too!” 
“Oh,” I said, “you mean Wilbur 
and his robot.” 

“There’s a crowd collecting out 
in front and I’ve had a dozen calls, 
and Joe is sitting out there with 
this — this—” 

“Alien,” I supplied. 

“And they’re bawling on one 
another’s shoulders like a pair of 
three-year-olds and . Alien!” 
“Sure,” I said. “What did you 
think he was?” 

Higgy reached out a shaky hand 
and pulled out a chair and fell 
weakly into it. “Samuel,” he said 
slowly, “give it to me once again. I 
don’t think I heard you right.” 
“Wilbur is an alien,” I told h im, 
“from some other world. He and 
his robot came here to listen to sad 
stories.” 

“Sad stories?” 

• “Sure. He likes sad stories. Some 
people like them happy and others 
like them dirty. He just likes them 
sad.” 

“If he is an alien,” said Higgy. 
talking to himself. 

CRYING JAG 





“He’s one, sure enough,” I said. 

“Sam, you’re sure of this?” 

“I am.” 

Higgy got excited. “Don’t you 
appreciate what this means to Mill- 
ville? This little town of ours — the 
first place on all of Earth that an 
alien visited!” 

I wished he would shut up and 
get out so I could have an after 
breakfast drink. Higgy didn’t drink 
especially on Sundays. He’d have 
been horrified. 

“The world will beat a pathway 
to our door!” he shouted. He got 
out of the chair and started for the 
living room. “I must extend my 
official welcome.” 

I trailed along behind him, for 
this was one I didn’t want to miss. 

J OE had left and Wilbur was sit- 
ting alone on the stoop and I 
could see that he already had on a 
sort of edge. 

Higgy stood in front of him and 
thrust out his chest and held out 
his hand and said, in his best offi- 
cial manner: “I am the mayor of 
Millville and I take great pleas- 
ure in extending to you our sincer- 
est welcome.” 

Wilbur shook hands with him 
and then he said : “Being the mayor 
of a city must be something of a 
burden and a great responsibility. 

I wonder that you bear up under 
it.” 

“Well, there are times . .” said 
Higgy. 



134

“But I can see that you are the 
kind of man whose main concern 
is the welfare of his fellow crea- 
tures and as such, quite naturally, 
you become the unfortunate target 
of outrageous and ungrateful ac- 
tions.” 

Higgy sat down ponderously on 
the stoop. “Sir,” he said to Wilbur, 
“you would not believe all I must 
put up with.” 

“Lester,” said Wilbur, “see that 
you get this down.” 

I went back into the house. I 
couldn’t stomach it. 

There was quite a crowd stand- 
ing out there in the road — Jake 
Ellis, the junkman, and Don My- 
ers, who ran the Jolly Miller, and a 
lot of others. And there, shoved 
into the background and sort of 
peering out, was the Widow Frye. 
People were on their way to 
church and they’d stop and look 
and then go on again, but others 
would come and take their place, 
and the crowd was getting bigger 
instead of thinning out. 

I went out to the kitchen and 
had my after-breakfast drink and 
did the dishes and wondered once 
again what I would feed Wilbur. 
Although, at the moment, he didn’t 
seem to be too interested in food. 

Then I went into the living room 
and sat down in the rocking chair 
and kicked off my shoes. I sat there 
wiggling my toes and thinking 
about what a screwy thing it was 
that Wilbur should get drunk on 



sadness instead of good red liquor. 

The day was warm and I was 
wore out and the rocking must 
have helped to put me fast asleep, 
for suddenly I woke up and there 
was someone in the room. I didn’t 
see who it was right off, but I knew 
someone was there. 

It was the Widow Frye. She was 
all dressed up for Sunday, and 
after all those years of passing my 
house on the opposite side of the 
street and never looking at it, as if 
the sight of it or me might con- 
taminate her— after all these years, 
there she was all dressed up and 
smiling. And me sitting there with 
all my whiskers on and my shoes 
off. 

?? CAMUEL,” said the Widow 
^ Frye, “I couldn’t help but 
tell you. I think your Mr. Wilbur 
is simply wonderful.” 

“He’s an alien,” I said. I had 
just woke up and was consider- 
able befuddled. 

“I don’t care what he is,” said 
the Widow Frye. “He is such a 
gentleman and so sympathetic. 
Not in the least like a lot of 
people in this horrid town.” 

I got to my feet and I didn’t 
know exactly what to do. She’d 
caught me off my guard and at a 
terrible disadvantage. Of all peo- 
ple in the world, she was the last 
I would have expected to come 
into my house. 

I almost offered her a drink,

but caught myself just in time. 

“You been talking to him?” I 
asked lamely. 

“Me and everybody else,” said 
the Widow Frye. “And he has a 
way with him. You tell him your 
troubles and they seem to go 
away. There’s a lot of people 
waiting for their turn.” 

“Well,” I told her, “I am glad 
to hear you say that. How’s he 
standing up under all this?” 

The Widow Frye moved closer 
and dropped her voice to a whis- 
per. “I think he’s getting tired. I 
would say — well, I’d say he was 
intoxicated if I didn’t know bet- 
ter.” 

I took a quick look at the clock. 

“Holy smoke!” I yelled. 

It was almost four o’clock. Wil- 
bur had been out there six or 
seven hours, lapping up all the 
sadness this village could dish 
out. By now he should be stiff 
clear up to his eyebrows. 

I busted out the door and he 
was sitting on the stoop and tears 
were running down his face and 
he was listening to Jack Ritter— 
and Old Jack was the biggest liar 
in all of seven counties. He was 
just making up this stuff he was 
telling Wilbur. 

“Sorry, Jack,” I said, pulling 
Wilbur to his feet. 

“But I was just telling him . .” 

“Go on home,” I hollered, “you 
and the others. You got him all 
tired out.” 



“Mr. Sam,” said Lester, “I am 
glad you came. He wouldn’t lis- 
ten to me.” 

The Widow Frye held the 
door open and I got Wilbur in 
and put him in my bed, where 
he could sleep it off. 

HEN I came back, the 
Widow Frye was waiting. “I 
was just thinking, Samuel,” she 
said. “I am having chicken for sup- 
per and there is more than I can 
eat. I wonder if you’d like to come 
on over.” 

I couldn’t say nothing for a 
moment. Then I shook my head. 

“Thanks just the same,” I said, 
“but I have to stay and watch over 
Wilbur. He won’t pay attention to 
the robot.” 

The Widow Frye was disap- 
pointed. “Some other time?” 

“Yeah, some other time.” 

I went out after she was gone 
and invited Lester in. 

“Can you sit down,” I asked, “or 
do you have to stand?” 

“I have to stand,” said Lester. 

So I left him standing there and 
sat down in the rocker. 

“What does Wilbur eat?” I 
asked. “He must be getting hun- 
gry” 

The robot opened a door in the 
middle of his chest and took out 
a funny-looking bottle. He shook 
it and I could hear something rat- 
tling around inside of it. 

“This is his nourishment,” said 




138 



GALAXY 



Lester. “He takes one every day.” 
He went to put the bottle back 
and a big fat roll fell out. He 
stooped and picked it up. 

“Money,” he explained. 

“You folks have money, too?” 
“We got this when we were in- 
doctrinated. Hundred-dollar bills.” 
“Hundred-dollar bills!” 

“Too bulky otherwise,” said 
Lester blandly. He put the money 
and the bottle back into his chest 
and slapped shut the door. 

I sat there in a fog. Hundred- 
dollar bills! 

“Lester,” I suggested, “maybe 
you hadn’t ought to show anyone 
else that money. They might try 
to take it from you.” 

“I know,” said Lester. “I keep 
it next to me.” And he slapped his 
chest. His slap would take the 
head right off a man. 

» 

sat rocking in the chair and 
■*- there was so much to think 
about that my mind went rocking 
back and forth with the chair. 
There was Wilbur first of all and 
the crazy way he got drunk, and 
the way the Widow Frye had 
acted, and all those hundred- 
dollar bills. 

Eespecially those hundred-dol- 
lar bills. 

“This indoctrination business?” 
I asked. “You said it was bootleg.” 
“It is, most definitely,” said 
Lester. “Acquired by some mis- 
guided individual who sneaked in 



and taped it to sell to addicts.” 
“But why sneak in?” 

“Off limits,” Lester said. “Out- 
side the reservation. Beyond the 
pale. Is the meaning clear?” 

“And this misguided adventurer 
figured he could sell the informa- 
tion he had taped, the — the—” 

“The culture pattern,” said Les- 
ter. “Your logic trends in the cor- 
rect direction, but it is not as sim- 
ple as you make it sound.” 

“I suppose not,” I said. “And this 
same misguided adventurer picked 
up the money, too.” 

“Yes, he did. Quite a lot of it.” 
I sat there for a while longer, 
then went in for a look at Wilbur. 
He was fast asleep, his catfish 
mouth blowing the whiskers in 
and out. So I went into the kitchen 
and got myself some supper. 

I had just finished eating when 
a knock came at the door. 

It was old Doc Abel from the 
sanitarium. 

“Good evening, Doc,” I said. “I’ll 
rustle up a drink.” 

“Skip the drink,” said Doc. “Just 
trot out your alien.” 

He stepped into the living room 
and stopped short at the sight of 
Lester. 

Lester must have seen that he 
was astonished for he tried immed- 
iately to put him at ease. “I am the 
so-called alien’s robot Yet despite 
the fact that I am a mere machine, 
I am a faithful servant. If you wish 
to tell your sadness, you may relate 



CRYING JAG 



139 



it to me with perfect confidence. I 
shall relay it to my master.” 

Doc sort of rocked back on his 
heels, but it didn’t floor him. 

“Just any kind of sadness?” he 
asked, “or do you hanker for a 
special kind?” 

“The master,” Lester said, “pre- 
fers the deep-down sadness, al- 
though he will not pass up any 
other kind.” 

“Wilbur gets drunk on it,” I said. 
“He’s in the bedroom now sleeping 
off a jag.” 

“Likewise,” Lester said, “confi- 
dentially, we can sell the stuff. 
There are people back home with 
their tongues hanging to their knees 
for this planet’s brand of sadness.” 

D OC looked at me and his eye- 
brows were so high that they 
almost hit his hairline. 

“It’s on the level, Doc,” I as- 
sured him. “It isn’t any joke. You 
want to have a look at Wilbur?” 

Doc nodded and I led the way 
into the bedroom and we stood 
there looking down at Wilbur. 
Sleeping all stretched out, he was 
a most unlovely sight. 

Doc put his hand up to his fore- 
head and dragged it down across 
his face, pulling down his chops 
so he looked like a bloodhound. 
His big, thick, loose lips made a 
blubbering sound as he pulled his 
palm across them. 

“I’ll be damned!” said Doc. 

Then he turned around and 



walked out of the bedroom and I 
trailed along behind him. He 
walked straight to the door and 
went out. He walked a ways down 
the driveway, then stopped and 
waited for me. Then he reached 
out and grabbed me by the shirt 
front and pulled it tight around 
me. 

“Sam,” he said, “you’ve been 
working for me for a long time now 
and you are getting sort of old 
Most other men would fire a man 
as old as you are and get a younger 
one. I could fire you any time I 
want to.” 

“I suppose you could,” I said, 
and it was an awful feeling, for I 
had never thought of being fired. 

I did a good job of janitoring up 
at the sanitorium and I didn’t mind 
the work. And I thought how ter- 
rible it would be if a Saturday 
came and I had no drinking money. 

“You been a loyal and faithful 
worker,” said old Doc, still hang- 
ing onto my shirt, “and I been a 
good employer. I always give you 
a Christmas bottle and another one 
at Easter.” 

“Right,” I said. “True, every 
word of it.” 

“So you wouldn’t fool old Doc,” 
said Doc. “Maybe the rest of the 
people in this stupid town, but not 
your old friend Doc.” 

“But, Doc,” I protested, “I ain’t 
fooling no one.” 

Doc let loose of my shirt. “By 
God, I don’t believe you are. It’s 



1 

like the way they tell me? He sits 
and listens to their troubles, and 
they feel better once they’re 
through?” 

“That’s what the Widow Frye 
said. She said she told him her 
troubles and they seemed to go 
away.” 

“That’s the honest truth, Sam?” 
“The honest truth,” I swore. 
Doc Abel got excited. He 
grabbed me by the shirt again. 

“Don’t you see what we have?” 
he almost shouted at me. 

“We?” I asked. 

"D UT he paid no attention. “The 
greatest psychiatrist,” said 
Doc, “this world has ever known. 
The greatest aid to psychiatry any- 
one ever has dredged up. You get 
what I am aiming at?” 

“I guess I do,” I said, not having 
the least idea. 

“The most urgent need of the 
human race,” said Doc, “is some- 
one or something they can shift 
their troubles to — someone who 
by seeming magic can banish their 
anxieties. Confession is the core 
of it, of course — a symbolic shift- 
ing of one’s burden to someone 
else’s shoulders. The principle is 
operative in the church confes- 
sional, in the profession of psy- 
chiatry, in those deep, abiding 
friendships offering a shoulder that 
one can cry upon.” 

“Doc, you’re right,” I said, be- 
ginning to catch on. 



“The trouble always is that the 
agent of confession must be hu- 
man, too. He has certain human 
limitations of which the confes- 
sor is aware. He can give no certain 
promise that he can assume the 
trouble and anxiety. But here we 
have something different. Here we 
have an alien — a being from the 
stars— unhampered by human lim- 
itations. By very definition, he can 
take anxieties and smother them 
in the depths of his own non- 
humanity . .” 

“Doc,” I yelled, “if you could 
only get Wilbur up at the sanitor- 
ium!” 

Doc rubbed mental hands to- 
gether. “The very thing that I had 
been thinking.” 

I could have kicked myself for 
my enthusiasm. I did the best I 
could to gain back the ground I’d 
lost. 

“I don’t know, Doc. Wilbur 
might be hard to handle.” 

“Well, let’s go back in and have 
a talk with him.” 

“I don’t know,” I stalled. 

“We got to get him fast. By 
tomorrow, the word will be out 
and the place will be overrun with 
newspapermen and TV trucks and 
God knows what. The scientific 
boys will be swarming in, and the 
government, and we’ll lose control.” 

“I’d better talk to him alone,” I 
said. “He might freeze up solid if 
you were around. He knows me 
and he might listen to me.”

Doc hemmed and hawed, But 
finally he agreed. 

“I’ll wait in the car,” he said. 
“You call me if you need me.” 

H E went crunching on down the 
driveway to where he had the 
car parked, and I went inside the 
house. 

“Lester,” I said to the robot, “I’ve 
got to talk to Wilbur. Its impor- 
tant.” 

“No more sad stories,” Lester 
warned. “He’s had enough today.” 
“No. I got a proposition.” 
“Proposition?” 

“A deal. A business arrange- 
ment.” 

“All right,” said Lester. “I will 
get him up.” 

It took quite a bit of getting up, 
but finally we had him fought 
awake and sitting on the bed. 

“Wilbur, listen carefully,” I told 
him. “I have comething right down 
your alley. A place where all the 
people have big and terrible 
troubles and an awful sadness. Not 
just some of them, but every one 
of them. They are so sad and 
troubled they can’t live with other 
people . .” 

Wilbur struggled off the bed, 
stood swaying on his feet. 

“Lead me to ’em, pal,” he said. 
I pushed him down on the bed 
again. “It isn’t as easy as all that. 
It’s a hard place to get into.” 

“I thought you said—” 

“Look, I have a friend who can 



arrange it for you. But it might 
take some money—” 

“Pal,” said Wilbur, “we got a roll 
of cash. How much would you 
need?” 

“It’s hard to say.” 

“Lester, hand it over to him so 
he can make this deal.” 

“Boss,” protested Lester, “I 
don’t know if we should.” 

“We can trust Sam,” said Wil- 
bur. “He is not the grasping sort. 
He won’t spend a cent more than 
is necessary.” 

“Not a cent,” I promised. 

Lester opened the door in his 
chest and handed me the roll of 
hundred-dollar bills and I stuffed 
it in my pocket 

“Now you will wait right here,” 
I told them, “and I’ll see this 
friend of mine. I’ll be back soon.” 
And I was doing some fast arith- 
metic, wondering how much I 
could dare gouge out of Doc. It 
wouldn’t hurt to start a little high 
so I could come down when Doc 
would roar and howl and scream 
and say what good friends we were 
and how he always had given me 
a bottle at Christmas and at Eas- 
ter. 

I turned to go out into the living 
room and stopped dead in my 
tracks. 

For standing in the doorway was 
another Wilbur, although when I 
looked at him more closely I saw 
the differences. And before he 
said a single word or did a single 

GALAXY 



thing, I had a sinking feeling that 
something had gone wrong. 

“Good evening, sir,” I said. “It’s 
nice of you to drop in.” 

He never turned a hair. “I see 
you have guests. It shall desolate 
me to tear them away from you.” 

T1EHIND me, Lester was mak- 
ing noises as if his gears were 
stripping, and out of the corner of 
my eye I saw that Wilbur sat stiff 
and stricken and whiter than a fish. 

“But you can’t do that,” I said. 
‘They only just showed up.” 

“You do not comprehend,” said 
the alien in the doorway. “They 
are breakers of the law. I have 
come to get them.” 

“Pal,” said Wilbur, speaking to 
me, “I am truly sorry. I knew all 
along it would not work out” 

“By this time,” the other alien 
said to Wilbur, “you should be 
convinced of it and give up trying.” 
And it was plain as paint, once 
you came to think of it, and I 
wondered why I hadn’t thought of 
it before. For if Earth was closed 
to the adventurers who’d gathered 

the indoctrination data 

“Mister,” I said to the alien in 
the doorway, “there are factors 
here of which I know you ain’t 
aware. Couldn’t you and me talk 
the whole thing over alone?” 

“I should be happy,” said the 
alien, so polite it hurt, “but please 
understand that I must carry out 
a duty.” 

CRYING JAG 



“Why, certainly,” I said. 

The alien stepped out of the 
doorway and made a sign behind 
him and two robots that had been 
standing in the living room just 
out of my line of vision came in. 

“Now all is secure,” said the 
alien, “and we can depart to talk. 
I will listen most attentively.” 

So I went out into the kitchen 
and he followed me. I sat down at 
the table and he sat across from 
me. 

“I must apologize,” he told me 
gravely. “This miscreant imposes 
upon you and your planet.” 

“Mister,” I told him back, “you 
have got it all wrong. I like this 
renegade of yours.” 

“Like him?” he asked, horrified. 
“That is impossible. He is a 
drunken lout and furthermore 
than that—” 

“And furthermore than that,” I 
said, grabbing the words right 
from his mouth, “he is doing us an 
awful lot of good.” 

The alien looked flabbergasted. 
“You do not know that which you 
say! He drags from you your an- 
xieties and feasts upon them most 
disgustingly, and he puts them 
down on record so he can’t pull 
them forth again and yet again to 
your eternal shame, and further- 
more than that—” 

“It’s not that way at all,” I 
shouted. “It does us a lot of good 
to pull out our anxieties and show 
them—” 



142 



143 




“Disgusting! More than that, 
indecent!” He stopped. “What was 
that?” 

“Telling our anxieties does us 
good,” I said as solemnly as I 
could. “It’s a matter of confession.” 

T HE alien banged an open palm 
against his forehead and the 
feathers on his catfish mouth stood 



straight out and quivered. 

“It could be true,” he said in 
horror. “Given a culture so primi- 
tive and so besodden and so 
shameless . .” 

“Ain’t we, though?” I agreed. 

“In our world,” said the alien, 
“there are no anxieties — well, not 
many. We are most perfectly ad- 
justed.” 



144 



GALAXY 




“Except for folks like Wilbur?” 
“Wilbur?” 

“Your pal in there,” I said. “I 
couldn’t say his name, so I call him 
Wilbur. By the way . .” 

He rubbed his hand across his 
face, and no matter what he said, 
it was plain to see that at that 
moment he was loaded with an- 
xiety. “Call me Jake. Call me any- 

CRYING JAG 



thing. Just so we get this mess re- 
solved.” 

“Nothing easier,” I said. “Let’s 
just keep Wilbur here. You don’t 
really want him, do you?” 

“Want him?” wailed Jake. “He 
and all the others like him are 
nothing but a headache. But they 
are our problem and our respon- 
sibility. We can’t saddle you.” 



145 




“You mean there are more like 
Wilbur?” 

Jake nodded sadly. 

“We’ll take them all,” I said. 
“We would love to have them. 
Every one of them.” 

“You’re crazy!” 

“Sure we are,” I said. “That is 
why we need them.” 

“You are certain, without any 
shadow of your doubt?” 

“Absolutely certain.” 

“Pal,” said Jake, “you have 
made a deal.” 

I stuck out my hand to shake on 
it, but I don’t think he even saw 
my hand. He rose out of the chair 
and you could see a vast relief 
lighting up his face. 

Then he turned and stalked out 
of the kitchen. 

“Hey, wait a minute!” I yelled. 
For there were details that I felt 
we should work out. But he didn’t 
seem to hear me. 

I jumped out of the chair and 
raced for the living room, but by 
the time I got there, there was no 
sign of Jake. I ran into the bed- 
room and the two robots were 
gone, too. Wilbur and Lester were 
in there all alone. 

“I told you,” Lester said to Wil- 
bur, “that Mr. Sam would fix it.” 

“I don’t believe it, pal,” said 
Wilbur. “Have they really gone? 
Have they gone for good? Is there 
any chance they will be coming 
back?” 

I raised my arm and wiped off 



my forehead with my sleeve. “They 
won’t bother you again. You are 
finally shut of them.” 

“That is excellent,” said Wilbur. 
“And now about this deal.” 

“Sure,” I said. “Give me just a 
minute. I’ll go out and see the 
man.” 

1 stepped out on the stoop and 
stood there for a while to get 
over shaking. Jake and his two 
robots had come very close to 
spoiling everything. I needed a 
drink worse than I had ever 
needed one, but I didn’t dare take 
the time. I had to get Doc on the 
dotted line before something else 
turned up. 

I went out to the car. 

“It took you long enough,” Doc 
said irritably. 

“It took a lot of talking for 
Wilbur to agree,” I said. 

“But he did agree?” 

“Yeah, he agreed.” 

“Well, then,” said Doc, “what are 
we waiting for?” 

“Ten thousand bucks,” I said. 
“Ten thousand . .” 

“That’s the price for Wilbur. 
I’m selling you my alien.” 

“Your alien! He is not your 
alien!” 

“Maybe not,” I said, “but he’s 
the next best thing. All I have to 
do is say the word and he won’t 
go with you.” 

“Two thousand,” declared Doc. 
“That’s every cent I’ll pay.” 



146 



GALAXY 



We got down to haggling and 
we wound up at seven thousand 
dollars. If I’d been willing to spend 
all night at it, I would have got 
eighty-five hundred. But I was all 
fagged out and I needed a drink 
much worse than I needed fifteen 
hundred extra dollars. So we set- 
tled on the seven. 

We went back into the house 
and Doc wrote out a check. 

“You know you’re fired, of 
■course,” he said, handing it to me. 

“I hadn’t thought about it,” I 
told him, and I hadn’t. The check 
for seven thousand in my hand and 
that roll of hundred-dollar bills 
bulging out my pocket added up to 
a lot of drinking money. 

I went to the bedroom door and 
called out Wilbur and Lester and 
I said to them: “Old Doc here has 
made up his mind to take you.” 

And Wilbur said. “I am so happy 
and so thankful. Was it hard, per- 
haps, to get him to agree to take 
us?” 

“Not too hard,” I said. “He was 
reasonable.” 

“Hey,” yelled Doc, with murder 
in his eyes, “what is going on here?” 

“Not a thing,” I said. 

“Well, it sounds to me . .” 

“There’s your boy,” I said. “Take 
him if you want him. If it should 
happen you don’t want him, I’ll be 
glad to keep him. There’ll be 
someone else along.” 

I held out the check to give 
it back to him. It was a risky thing 



to do, but I was in a spot where I 
had to bluff. 

T~k OC waved the check away, but 
he was still suspicious that he 
was being taken, although he 
wasn’t sure exactly how. But he 
couldn’t take the chance of losing 
out on Wilbur. I could see that he 
had it all figured out — how he’d 
become world famous with the 
only alien psychiatrist in captivity. 

Except there was one thing that 
he didn’t know. He had no idea 
that in just a little while there 
would be other Wilburs. And I 
stood there, laughing at him with- 
out showing it, while he herded 
Wilbur and Lester out the door. 

Before he left, he turned back 
to me. 

“There is something going on,” 
he said, and when I find out about 
it, I am going to come back and 
take you apart for it.” 

I never said a word, but just 
stood there listening to the three 
of them crunching down the drive- 
way. When I heard the car leave, 

I went out into the kitchen and 
took down the bottle. 

I had a half a dozen fast ones. 
Then I sat down in a chair at the 
kitchen table and practiced some 
restraint. I had a half a dozen 
slow ones. 

I got to wondering about the 
other Wilburs that Jake had 
agreed to send to Earth and I 
wished I’d been able to pin him 



CRYING JAG 



147 



down a bit. But I had had no 
chance, for he had jumped up and 
disappeared just when I was ready 
to get down to business. 

All I could do was hope he’d 
deliver them to me— either in the 
front yard or out in the driveway— 
but he’d never said he would. A fat 
lot of good it would do me if he 
just dropped them anywhere. 

And I wondered when he would 
deliver them and how many there 
might be. It might take a bit of 
time, for more than likely he would 
indoctrinate them before they 
were dropped on Earth, and as to 
number, I had not the least idea. 
From the way he talked, there 
might even be a couple of dozen 
of them. With that many, a man 
could make a roll of cash if he 
handled the situation right. 

Although, it seemed to me, I had 
a right smart amount of money 
now. 

I dug the roll of hundred-dollar 
bills out of my pocket and made 
a stab at counting them, but for 
the life of me I couldn’t keep the 
figures straight. 

Here I was drunk and it wasn’t 
even Saturday, but Sunday. I 
didn’t have a job and now I could 
get drunk any time I wanted. 

So I sat there working on the 
jug and finally passed out. 

r I ^ HERE was an awful racket 
and I came awake and won- 
dered where I was. In a little while 



I got it figured out that I’d been 
sleeping at the kitchen table and 
I had a terrible crick in my neck 
and a hangover that was even 
worse. 

I stumbled to my feet and 
looked at the clock. It was ten 
minutes after nine. 

The racket kept right on. 

I made it out to the living room 
and opened the front door. The 
Widow Frye almost fell into the 
room, she had been hammering on 
the door so hard. 

“Samuel,” she gasped, “have 
you heard about it?” 

“I ain’t heard a thing,” I told 
her, “except you pounding on the 
door.” 

“It’s on the radio.” 

“You know darn well I ain’t got 
no radio nor no telephone nor no 
TV set. I ain’t got no time for 
modern trash like that.” 

“It’s about the aliens,” she said. 
“Like the one you have. The nice, 
kind, understanding alien people. 
They are everywhere. Everywhere 
on Earth. There are a lot of them 
all over. Thousands of them. May- 
be millions . .” 

I pushed past her out the door. 
They were sitting on front steps 
all up and down the street, and 
they were walking up and down 
the road, and there were a bunch 
of them playing, chasing one an- 
other, in a vacant lot. 

“It’s like that everywhere!” cried 
the Widow Frye. “The radio just

said so. There are enough of them 
so that everyone on Earth can 
have one of their very own. Isn’t 
it wonderful?” 

That dirty, doublecrossing Jake, 
I told myself. Talking like there 
weren’t many of them, pretending 
that his culture was so civilized 
and so well adjusted that there 
were almost no psychopaths. 

Although, to be fair about it, he 
hadn’t said how many there might 
be of them — not in numbers, that 
is. And even all he had dumped 
on Earth might be a few in relation 
to the total population of his par- 
ticular culture. 

And then, suddenly, I thought of 
something else. 

I hauled out my watch and 
looked at it. It was only a quarter 
after nine. 

‘Widow Frye,” I said, “excuse 
me. I got an errand to run.” 

I legged it down the street as 
fast as I could. 



f)NE of the Wilburs detached 
himself from a group of them 
and loped along with me. 

“Mister,” he said, “have you got 
some troubles to tell me?” 

“Naw,” I said. “I never have no 
troubles.” 

“Not even any worries?” 

“No worries, either.” 

Then it occurred to me that 
there was a worry — not for me 
alone, but for the entire world. 

For with all the Wilburs that 
Jake had dumped on Earth, there 
would in a little while be no human 
psychopaths. There wouldn’t be a 
human with a worry or a trouble. 
God, would it be dull! 

But I didn’t worry none. 

I just loped along as fast as I 
could go. 

I had to get to the bank before 
Doc had time to stop payment on 
that check for seven thousand dol- 
lars.

T HE first thirty years of 
Henry Talbot’s life were 
the most promising. He was 
a bright student through high 
school, and in college his fellow stu- 
dents often used the word “bril- 
liant” in discussing his mentality; 
occasionally even his instructors 
echoed them. 



of all people. Dr. Talbot! 

DICK FRANCIS 

Upon receiving his bachelor’s de- 
gree, he went to graduate school 
and eventually received his Ph.D. 
as an experimental nuclear physi- 
cist. He applied for and got a re- 
search position at Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory, in the Elec- 
tronuclear Research Division. 

Dr. Henry Talbot, brilliant 
GALAXY 



■ •young scientist, began his career 
I enthusiastically, and ran into a 
brick wall. 

Rather, he crawled up to and 
against it, for it took several years 
for him to discover that his life’s 
route lay not on an unobstructed 
downhill slide. Those years slith- 
ered past before he looked up and 
Realized that he had not revolution- 
ized the scientific world; he had 
discovered no principle of relativi- 
ty, no quantum theory. 

He stopped working for a mo- 
ment and looked around. All his 
colleagues were enthusiastic and 
brilliant young scientists. Where at 
school, where throughout his life, 
he had been outstanding, now he 
was one of the crowd. What had 
passed for brilliance before was 
now merely competence. 

Henry Talbot felt a vague need 
which he perceived liquor might 
fill. That afternoon he left work 
early for the first time since he had 
arrived at Oak Ridge. He had to 
buy the vodka from a bootlegger, 
Oak Ridge being in a dry county. 
But, as in most dry counties, that 
presented no problem. He stopped 
by Shorty’s cab stand, across the 
street from the police department, 
and asked Shorty for a bottle. Shor- 
ty reached into the glove compart- 
ment and, for fifty cents over list 
price, the vodka changed hands. 
Henry didn’t like to patronize the 
bootleggers, but he did feel the 
need for a quick one just this once. 
EAST IN THE MORNING 



After drinking for several hours 
in his apartment, Henry Talbot 
took stock of himself and came to 
two conclusions: 

1. He was satisfied with him- 
self and his life. He had always 
taken for granted that he would 
one day be a famous figure in some 
scientific field, true, but this was 
actually not so important as, upon 
casual inspection, it might seem. He 
liked his work, otherwise he could 
never have been so wrapped up 
in it, and he saw no reason for dis- 
continuing it or for becoming des- 
pondent over his lack of fame. 
After all, he reasoned, he had never 
been famous and yet had been al- 
ways perfectly content. 

2. He liked vodka. 

nr HE next thirty years of Henry 
Talbot’s life, now devoid of 
promise, were fulfilling and con- 
tent. He worked steadily and drank 
as the mood fell upon him, publish- 
ing on the average one paper a 
year. These papers were thorough, 
the experiments well worked out, 
without contrived results or var- 
nished sloppiness. The publications 
were accepted everywhere as solid 
research papers. 

Henry Talbot’s name became fa- 
miliar in the nuclear field. He did 
not find his face on the cover of 
Time, nor was he ever invited to 
participate as an “expert” on any 
television quiz programs, yet he 
was well known to nuclear re-

searchers— at least those in his own 
country. He was honored with a 
banquet on his fiftieth birthday. 
Person to Person once tentatively 
proposed to visit him, but the idea 
was squelched, a visit to a more 
buxom personality being substi- 
tuted. 

Sex never reared its ugly head. 
He had not had time for it when 
young, and so had never fallen into 
the habit. 

At the age of sixty-five he re- 
tired. He canceled his subscription 
to the Physical Review, bought a 
fishing rod, subscribed to the New 
Yorker, and tried Florida. He 
started at Tallahassee and fished 
his way down to Ocala. By the time 
he had reached St. Petersburg, he 
had decided to try California. 

In California he took up golf. He 
bought a hi-fi set and a dozen pro- 
gressive jazz records, advertised as 
unbreakable. They proved not to 
be, although in fairness to the ad- 
vertiser it must be said that Henry 
Talbot had to exert himself. 

He decided to try a world cruise. 
He left the scheduled tour in Japan 
and visited the Institute for Theo- 
retical Physics in Tokyo, spending 
some time there just generally 
chewing the bilingual rag. When he 
returned to the United States, he 
renewed his subscription to the 
Physical Review, canceled his sub- 
scription to the New Yorker, and 
looked around for another position. 

He went to work for the Arnold 



Research Corporation on a part- 
time, semi-retired basis. But he had 
his own lab, his hours were his own, 
and in a few weeks he was working 
full time. No one was disturbed by 
this, he did not apply for more 
money or recognition, he kept to 
himself, and he began publishing 
his one paper each year. 

On the tenth year afterward his 
paper was missing, though not 
missed. He began to spend less 
time in his lab and more in the 
library and behind his desk, scrib- 
bling on scraps of paper or staring 
into space. He was forgotten by the 
Arnold Research Corporation. He 
was content with his books and his 
monthly check. 

In his seventy-fourth year, Hen- 
ry Talbot published a paper in the 
Philosophical Magazine on what he 
called the “Warped Field Theory.” 
The theory was entirely his own, 
from beginning to end, and con- 
stituted — in his opinion — the first 
real breakthrough in theoretical 
physics since Albert Einstein’s lit- 
tle idea in 1905. The day the article 
came out he sat behind his desk all 
day, puffing on his pipe, not mere- 
ly content but really happy for the 
first time in his life. 

T IFE continued undisturbed for 
three more months. Then Lar- 
ry Arnold, Jr., came into his office, 
carrying a copy of the Philosophi- 
cal Magazine. Larry Arnold, Jr., 
was not a scientist but, as he put it, 
GALAXY 



154 



he was scientifically minded and 
was general overseer, public rela- 
tions man, and coordinator of co- 
ordinators of research. 

He humphed a few times, 
groaned as he sat down across the 
desk from Henry, wheezed twice, 
smiled once, and said, “Good morn- 
ing, Dr. Talbot.” 

“Good morning,” Henry replied, 
folding his hands and trying to look 
humble yet brilliant. 

“I read your article,” Arnold 
said, feebly waving the magazine 
around before him, “and I don’t 
mind admitting I didn’t understand 
a word of it. Well, I’m not a man 
to hide his lack of knowledge so 
I went right out and asked some 
of the men working here about it. 
They didn’t understand it either. 
I called up a few people around the 
country. I — Dr. Talbot, I don’t 
know how exactly to say this to 
you. I don’t know what you in- 
tended with this article, but it’s got 
people laughing at us and we can’t 
have that.” 

Henry kept the same humble 
look on his face; he fought to keep 
the same expression. He didn’t 
know what his face might look like 
if he relaxed for a moment. 

“We didn’t expect much research 
from you when we hired you. Well, 
we know we’re not paying you 
much, and we don’t mind if you 
don’t put out much work. Hell, we 
don’t care if you don’t put out any 
work. We get our money’s worth in 

EAST IN THE MORNING 



good will when people know we’ve 
got an old pro like you on our pay- 
roll; the young kids can see we 
won’t kick them out when they’re 
all used up. But when you put out 
papers like this one — ” and here he 
waved the magazine a bit more vio- 
lently, getting warmed up — “when 
you do this, and it says Arnold Re- 
search Corporation right here un- 
der your name, people don’t just 
laugh at you. They laugh at the 
whole organization. They think 
that this whole place is going 
around doing fantastic research 
like this — this warped field.” 

He stopped when he saw the 
look slip a bit from Henry’s face, 
and he saw what was there beneath 
it. He dropped his eyes and 
wheezed twice, then heaved his 
bulk out of the chair. 

“I didn’t mean to slam into you 
that way, Dr. Talbot. You know it’s 
an honor to have you associated 
with the firm. We were even think- 
ing of giving you a testimonial ban- 
quet next week on your seventy- 
fifth birthday ... It is next week, 
isn’t it? Well, what I mean to say 
is — I mean we all appreciate the 
good solid research you’ve been 
doing all these years. It’s just that 
— well, you won’t fool around like 
this any more, now will you? And 
we’ll just forget all about it. No 
hard feelings.” 

He left quickly, and the door 
closed behind him. 

For the first time in seventy-five 

155 



years, or in the last sixty-nine at 
least, Henry Talbot cried. 

After he cried, he became angry. 
He wanted to shout, so he left the 
office early and hurried to his 
apartment where he could shout 
without disturbing anyone, which 
he did. He then took out the vodka, 
settled Bucephalus, his cat, on his 
lap and began to pour. 

Several hours later Henry Tal- 
bot sprawled in the armchair and 
took stock of himself. He came to 
two conclusions: 

1. At his age, what did he care 
about fame? He knew his theory 
was sound, and if the people in his 
own country didn’t appreciate it, 
what difference did it make? Now, 
free from rancor, he could under- 
stand how they must have received 
his paper. They all knew old Dr. 
Talbot — seventy-five and not dead 
yet. What a ridiculous age for a 
nuclear physicist! Now he’s turn- 
ing theoretical, they must have 
chuckled. So they started his paper. 
And when they came to the first 
unorthodox assumption, when they 
reached the first of the many 
mathematical complexities and in- 
deed paradoxes, they must have 
closed the magazine and had a good 
laugh over a cup of coffee. 

Had the article been written by 
some unknown twenty-five-year- 
old, they would all hail him as 
a new genius. But coming from old 
Henry Talbot, the article was 
ludicrous. 



Well, he didn’t care. Abroad, he 
was not so well known. Some coun- 
tries would not have heard of him 
at all. They’d read the article 
seriously, one or two men would 
understand it. They’d run some ex- 
periments to confirm or deny the 
hypotheses and Henry was confi- 
dent the experiments would prove 
him right. He had only to wait Of 
course he hadn’t much time left, 
but perhaps they would do it in a 
year or two, and perhaps he’d still 
be here to see it and have the last 
laugh. 

2. He still liked vodka. 

T T was nineteen years before two 
-*• Finish physicists, Arkadt and 
Findrun, ran the necessary experi- 
ments. Of the many who had read 
the article, some knew Talbot and 
thus laughed it off, some could not 
understand it, and some understood 
it and waxed enthusiastic. Even- 
tually the enthusiasm spread to the 
Finnish Institute for Applied Re- 
search where the essential equip- 
ment was available. The experi- 
ments were an unqualified success. 

As soon as the experiments were 
confirmed, Arkadt sent a telegram 
to Dr. Henry Talbot, in care of the 
address which had appeared with 
his original article, informing him 
of the happy developments. He and 
Findrun were still celebrating their 
spectacular success a week later, 
this time with Dr. Arrhenial, direc- 
tor of the institute, when Arkadt 
GALAXY 



156 



mentioned that he had sent such a 
telegram and had received as yet 
no answer. 

Arrhenial smiled into his vodka. 
“Didn’t you know? Talbot was sev- 
enty-five years old when he wrote 
that article. I’m afraid you were a 
little too late for him.” 

“I didn’t know,” Arkadt replied. 

“A shame,” Findrun murmured. 
“It would have made him so hap- 

py” 

The telephone rang and Arkadt 
answered it His wife was calling, 
with unusual news. He had just re- 
ceived a letter from America. 
Imagine that. From a Henry Tal- 
bot. 

TTENRY Talbot saw his face on 
the cover of Time magazine. 
He refused a request to appear on a 
television quiz program. (The con- 
testant the network had had in 
mind to appear with Henry won his 
money nevertheless, in the cate- 
gory Theoretical Physics, by cor- 
rectly naming the year in which 
Einstein first published his Theory 
of Relativity, the number of papers 
which comprised the entire theory, 
the language in which it was first 
published, die magazine in which 
it was first published, the year in 
which the magazine was first 
printed, the name of the first 
printer of the magazine, and the 
year in which he died.) Henry Tal- 
bot was termed “The Dean of 
American Men of Science” by the 

EAST IN THE MORNING 



New York Times, which paper tri- 
umphantly reported that only thir- 
teen people in the world under- 
stood his Warped Field Theory. 
When asked if there was now any- 
thing else for science to do, he re- 
plied, “Indubitably.” When pressed 
for more details, he said that his 
housekeeper always removed his 
vodka from the refrigerator at 
three-thirty, and that if he did not 
immediately return home, it would 
become unbearably warm. 

On the occasion of his ninety- 
fifth birthday, he was given a gi- 
gantic testimonial banquet by the 
Arnold Research Corporation, “un- 
der whose auspices the entire re- 
search which culminated in the 
justly famous Warped Field 
Theory was conducted.” 

The next week, when he re- 
quested the use of their massive 
cyclotron to run an experiment, he 
was told that the machine was in 
use at the time. A week later, his 
request was again shunted off. This 
happened twice more, and Henry 
went to see Larry Arnold, Jr. 

The coordinator was affable, and 
told Henry that he had checked 
himself, and that unfortunately the 
machine was in use and that of 
course since he, Talbot, was actual- 
ly at the lab on only a part-time 
basis, he could not expect to usurp 
the machine from full-time re- 
search workers. 

Henry asked what kind of re- 
search was being done.

Larry wheezed twice and told 
him it was investigating certain as- 
pects of the Warped Field Theory. 

“I invented the goddam theory 
and I can’t even get at the ma- 
chine?” Henry shouted. 

“Please, Dr. Talbot. Let’s be 
reasonable. You discovered that 
theory twenty years ago. I mean, 
after all. You’re an older man now, 
and that’s an expensive piece of 
machinery—” 

Henry slammed the door as he 
walked out, was not satisfied with 
the effect, came back and slammed 
it again, this time shattering the 
glass. He felt a little better, strode 
down the hall, and resigned the 
next day, quietly and undramati- 
cally. 

He disappeared into retirement 
Reports of his death were printed 
occasionally. They were never de- 
nied. They stopped after several 
years, were taken to be final, and 
his name was not often mentioned 
by the newspapers. 

One hundred and three years af- 
ter his birth, the Nobel Prize was 
awarded to Henry Talbot for his 
Warped Field Theory. The com- 
mittee decided not to look into the 
matter of discovering Dr. Talbot’s 
heirs until after the ceremony, ex- 
pecting that someone would turn 
up to claim the award in his name. 

Henry Talbot accepted the me- 
dallion and check himself from the 
hand of the King of Sweden, mak- 
ing his acceptance speech in hur- 
EAST IN THE MORNING 



riedly learned but understandable 
Swedish. The newspapers of the 
world devoured him and made big 
news of the fact that he had been 
practically fired nine years before. 
He was deluged with offers of em- 
ployment, most of which sought 
him as a public-relations man. He 
accepted the offer of the Institute 
for Advanced Study in Princeton, 
New Jersey. His duties here were 
non-existent. He would be paid, 
cared for. He was to think, as much 
or as little as he pleased. The Insti- 
tute was apologetic that they had 
not been aware of his unemploy- 
ment previously. He was invited to 
stay with them for as long as he 
liked. Henry Talbot settled back 
finally, in comfort. 

The research upon which he now 
embarked was so deep, so complex, 
that he did not intend to come to 
any publishable conclusions in his 
lifetime. He desired no experimen- 
tation now; he- wanted only to 
think, to think in purely mathe- 
matical terms of the universe as an 
entity. He withdrew into the sanc- 
tity of his study, thankful to Prince- 
ton for the peace and tranquility it 
offered. 

Several years later a notice of 
his death was published in the New 
York Times. Henry did not read 
the New York Times, but the treas- 
urer at the Institute evidently did. 
His checks stopped coming. Henry 
did not complain. He had saved a 
lot of money and his tastes were 

159 



simple. He did not have to pay a 
bootlegger’s price in Princeton. 

In his hundred and eighty-first 
year, Henry first became seriously 
aware of the possibility that he 
might not die. 

night during his two hun- 
dred and forty-fifth year — 
it began to seem to him purpose- 
less, but he still kept accurate count 
— Henry pushed back from his desk 
and sighed. 

Outside the window, in the gen- 
tly falling snow, the campus of 
Princeton looked exactly as it had 
when he had first come, but things 
were different. No one now at the 
Institute knew him; he had known 
no one there for seventy-five years 
now. Probably at no other place in 
the country than at the Institute 
for Advanced Study could he have 
kept his study for so long, could he 
have been left so alone. And it was 
good, but now he was lonely. Lone- 
ly, bored by his solitude, aware of 
his boredom and utter lack of 
friends. 

He had realized long ago the 
compensation demanded for eter- 
nity. When he had first begun to 
think of the possibility that he 
might not die, he had realized that 
it would mean leaving his friends, 
his family, and continuing alone. 
When he had first begun to specu- 
late on his seeming immortality, 
how it had come about and why, he 
had known he would be lonely.

This is the way to the Ubermensch, 
This is the way to the Ubermensch, 
This is the way to the Ubermensch, 
Not in a crowd, but alone. 

Nearly every great mind within 
the past hundred years had pointed 
out the difficulty of man’s accom- 
plishing anything in his brief hun- 
dred years of life, had pointed out 
the necessity of immortality to a 
great mind. And what is necessary 
will be. But this is the way of evo- 
lution: not in a crowd, but alone. 
One man in a million, then another, 
then another. 

It was statistically improbable 
that he was the first. So there must 
be others. But so far, in two hun- 
dred and forty-five years, he had 
not met any that he knew of. Then 
again, there was no way of knowing. 
Anyone passing him on the street 
would not know, and he meeting 
another would not know. 

A purring broke through into his 
reverie and, looking down, he be- 
came aware of Bucephalus, his cat, 
rubbing against his legs. He 
laughed, bent down and picked her 
up. Here was the exception, of 
course. Old Bucephalus. He 
laughed again, shaking his head in 
wonder. He had had Bucephalus 
for the past hundred and fifty years. 

“Now what justification does a 
cat have for living forever?” he 
wondered aloud, holding her at 
arm’s length and smiling at her. She 
lifted one paw and dabbed at his 
face. He put her down and went to 

GALAXY 



get her milk. “And how did we ever 
find each other?” Perhaps there 
was some subliminal way of know- 
ing. Perhaps, without knowing, the 
immortals knew. 

While Bucephalus lapped at her 
milk, Henry Talbot walked out for 
a breath of air. He wandered off the 
campus, finally pausing in front of 
a candy-and-soda store. He felt a 
vague curiosity and went in to look 
at the newspapers. After reading 
through one, he stood back and 
sighed. The same old thing, always 
the same old thing. The new wave 
of immigrants — he looked again to 
see where they were from this time; 
he didn’t recognize the name of the 
place, but it didn’t matter— the new 
wave of immigrants was a disgrace 
to New York, was destroying real 
estate values, was a burden to so- 
ciety, to the last wave of immi- 
grants who had by now made their 
place. The President said we would 
fight, if necessary, one last war to 
make the world safe for democracy. 
Statistics showed that juvenile de- 
linquency was on the increase; it 
was traced to a lack of parental 
authority in the home. 

Always the same old thing. 

Only his work was new, always 
changing. But now, after nearly a 
hundred and fifty years of thought, 
he felt he was in over his head. It 
was getting too abstract. He needed 
some good solid experimental re- 
search, he felt. Something concrete, 
down-to-earth. He wanted to play 
EAST IN THE MORNING 



with a hundred-channel analyzer, 
measure some cross sections, deter- 
mine a beta-decay scheme. But he 
couldn’t ask them here for a lab. He 
didn’t dare tell them who he was. 
Too much commotion, notoriety. 
The newspapers again. Good God, 
no. 

He turned to go back to his 
study, and then stopped dead. He 
couldn’t go back there. His brain 
was spinning without a clamp; he 
needed to fasten to something and 
orient himself in this vast universe. 
His fingers itched to get at some ex- 
periment. He couldn’t go back to 
his study. 

He decided to take a vacation. 
He had never gotten as far as 
Miami Beach, he remembered. 
The sun would feel good, and he 
could do with a bit of a tan. 

He flew down that night. 

After he had checked in at the 
Sea Lion, and as he was following 
the bellboy across the high and 
wide lobby to the elevator, a wom- 
an crossed his path. In her late 
twenties, perhaps early thirties, she 
was simply stunning. Dark hair, 
light skin, blue eyes almost purple 
with a Eurasian slant to them, long 
firm legs and slim ankles. For the 
first time in many a year, Henry 
stopped to look at a woman. 

The bellboy realized that he had 
walked on alone and returned to 
Talbot. 

“That woman is beautiful.” Hen- 
ry gestured toward her back. 



161 



The bellboy smirked. Henry fol- 
lowed him to his room. 

TTENRY lay in the sun for two 
weeks and grew younger day 
by day. His skin tanned, his muscles 
became hard with the exertion of 
lengthy swims, the creases in his 
face smoothed out. Still he felt 
vaguely dissatisfied, empty. He lay 
on the beach, gazing into the ocean, 
and knew that something was miss- 
ing. 

The woman he had seen that first 
night crossed between him and the 
ocean and continued down the 
beach. Henry watched her out of 
sight. 

“That woman is beautiful,” he 
thought. 

Sex, he thought. I wonder if that’s 
what’s missing. There was another 
aspect to be considered, of course. 
Two hundred and forty-five. And 
then a blonde young lady in a bikini 
wavered by him and he knew in 
that moment that he could. 

He stood up and walked after 
her. 

“I wonder if I might walk a bit 
with you,” he said. 

She looked him over carefully 
and then shrugged her shoulder, not 
quite dislodging the upper portion 
of her suit. “Suitcha self.” 

After a while she asked, “What 
business ya in?” 

“I’m sort of retired,” he ex- 
plained, finding her very charming 
and refreshing to talk to. “I had a 
162 



modest income a while ago. I in- 
vested wisely, or prudently at least, 
and the interest has built up into 
quite a fortune by now.” 

“Really,” she said. 

They walked down the beach, 
hand in hand. 

Tj 1 IVE nights later he got out of 
bed when she fell asleep. He 
dressed and walked despondently 
down to the lobby. This was not 
it, not it at all. God, but her conver- 
sation was absolutely impossible. 
He couldn’t stay with her another 
minute. 

His problem was still unsolved. 
He wanted to get back to work, he 
wanted company, he wanted life 
again. As he came into the lobby, 
the woman of the first night passed 
by him again. She looked at him as 
she came, and smiled as she passed. 

That, he thought, is a lovely 
woman. He stared at her back. How 
old would you say she is? Late 
twenties, not a day over thirty. Yet 
with a serenity in the eyes, in the 
smile somehow, that gives the im- 
pression of lifetimes of living. Yet 
not a day over thirty, surely no 
older than that. 

That, he thought, is what I need. 
A woman like that to sleep with 
and, yes, to be with, even to talk 
with. She would not be like the one 
upstairs. But, he thought, one does 
not buy a woman like that One 
marries her. Somehow, without 
knowing, he knew that. 



GALAXY 



And why not? 

Why not, indeed? 

He returned to his own room, 
stripped and consulted the mirror. 
Dye his hair, that was really all he 
needed. He smiled into the mirror. 
Forty, he thought, even thirty-five. 
Certainly, with this tan and slim 
body and his hair dyed, thirty-five 
at the most. 

He went to bed, happily making 
plans. A new life opened up for 
him. 

He would take a new name; he 
would liveagain. There was nothing 
to stop him. 

That night, in the Sea Lion Hotel 
in Miami Beach, Henry Talbot 
died. 



r F'WO months later Arnold Bot- 
tal, an experimental nuclear 
physicist of perhaps thirty-five, and 
his charming wife — with exquisite, 
nearly purple Eurasian eyes — 
joined the new country club in 
Lincoln Hills, New York, where 
Bottal had newly joined the Ap- 
plied Physics Division of the Car- 
bide Nuclear Company. 

This Arnold Bottal was not a 
brilliant physicist, but he was cer- 
tainly competent in his job. The 
company was satisfied with him. He 
and his wife bought a bubble home 
in the suburbs of Lincoln Hills and, 
together with their cat Bucephalus, 
lived happily ever after.

OSSIAN’S RIDE by Fred Hoyle. 
Harper & Bros., N.Y., $3.00 

IN ACCOLADING last year’s The 
Black Cloud by the famous cos- 
mologist, I hoped that he would 
occasionally go on forsaking his 
telescope for the typewriter. He 
did. And his new book is an even 
happier event in some ways than 
its startling predecessor. Hoyle’s 
story writing skill, technique and 
dialogue have improved tremen- 
dously since his first effort, which 
was notable mainly for its humor 
and rich imagination. 

Here he has turned out a sci- 



ence-mystery-spy story that has no 
apparent forebear in the SF reper- 
tory. In fact, John Buchan and E. P. 
Oppenheim are the spiritual god- 
fathers of this action-crammed 
thriller. 

The basic idea is novel— a brand- 
new industrial complex, only ten 
years old, secreted in a remote and 
intensely guarded corner of Ire- 
land, already overshadowing the 
giant industrial nations and dedi- 
cated to maintaining its mystery. 
The secret is finally uncovered by a 
resourceful young Cambridge stu- 
dent, one of the most unorthodox 
spies in SF history, after some

GALAXY, THE FOURTH GAL- 
AXY READER, edited by H. L.

TWO ANTHOLOGIES of stories

remark on. 

ENCOUNTER by J. Hunter Hol- 
ly. Avalon Books, N.Y., $2.75 

HOLLY, the newest addition to 
the Avalon stable of rapid-reading, 
action-packed authors, is even 
rapider and more fully packed 
than the average. His yam of an 
alien castaway marooned on Earth 
is spattered with the blood of some 
twenty murders. 

Appears as if the alien has pow- 
er to absorb knowledge directly 
from other brains, but only at the 
cost of gruesomely exploded crani- 
ums. He can sense emotion, al- 
though not a true telepath, and can 
control all animal life except fe- 
lines. A being like that could rule 
the world if he wants to and he 
wants to. 

However, we’re a pretty tough 
species when our and our cats’ backs

PURPLE PIRATE by Talbot 
Mundy. Gnome Press, Hicksville, 
N.Y., $4.50 

SINCE SEQUELS almost invari- 
ably are diminished returns, and 
with Tros of Samothrace the prede- 
cessor, any successor would seem 
foredoomed to mediocrity. How- 
ever, Purple Pirate, rescued by 
Gnome from a quarter-century of 
oblivion, is fully its equal in plot 
audacity, skill of execution and 
characterization. 

Tros’s story reopens in Egypt 
shortly after the death of his erst- 
while bitter enemy, Caesar. He is 
kept busy rescuing Cleopatra’s 
chestnuts while she maliciously 
holds his Norse crew hostage, fore- 
stalling his dream of circumnavi- 
gating the globe. 

Tros has all of Conan’s attributes 
plus one: though a superman, he 
is only human. Conan never has 
inner thoughts or fears; Tros is 
plagued by them. Additionally, 
each chapter head holds pearls of 
wisdom from his introspection, as 
did the former book, that constitute 
a culture’s code of ethics in them- 
selves.

GIANTS FROM ETERNITY by 
Manly Wade Wellman. Avalon 
Books, N.Y., $2.75 



165 



QUAINTNESS IS the keynote of 
this yarn, brought back from the 
dust of decades, like its titled 
Giants. 

Earth is threatened by the un- 
leashed growth of an alien life-form 
that absorbs and transmutes all 
substances into its own matter 
type. However, a gaseous essence 
of the substance has the power to 
revivify the dead. To solve the 
problem of man’s survival, Oliver 
Norfleet recalls Tom Edison, Lou 
Pasteur, Charlie Darwin, Ike New- 
ton and Cutie Curie. 

The naivete of the fairytale plot 
is refreshing, if viewed as a device 
for getting five delightful oldtimers 
back into circulation — and if fairy- 
tale logic and dismissal of inconven- 
ient facts don’t irritate you.

LORD OF THE FLIES by Wm. 
Golding. Capricorn Books, N.Y., 
$1.25 

ONE OF civilization-harassed 
mankind’s oldest dreams is the 
tropic isle, plentifully stocked with 
accessible goodies and free from 
human and animal predators. Gold- 
ing unloads his band of sub-teen- 
ers on such an island paradise, vic- 
tims of an unnamed and unde- 
scribed war. 

For the first time free of adult 
supervision, the instinct of the Brit- 
ish youngsters is to revel. However, 
for rescue, a signal fire must be 
166 



tended, argues twelve-year-old 
Ralph who gets elected leader of a 
democracy. From that point on, 
Golding paints a truly terrifying 
picture of the decay of a miniscule 
society. 

Well on its way to becoming a 
modern classic, this ’55 hard-cover 
is welcome in its Putnam-Capri- 
corn reissue.

THE STARS ARE TOO HIGH 
by Agnew H. Bahnson, Jr. Random 
House, Inc., N.Y., $3.95 

THE REVERSE of Divide and 
Conquer must be Frighten and 
Unite. History holds many exam- 
ples and SF several notable ones, 
most of them meant to avert global 
war with phony extraterrestrial 
threat. 

Bahnson’s UFO does nearly 
every maneuver accredited to bona 
fide saucers, only it was secretly 
built in Nevada by private citizens. 
In early SF, this was standard, but 
half a thought will show what a 
tiger’s tail such a situation is. 

To solve their dilemma, the 
three builders enlist the aid of the 
scientific adviser to the Air Force 
Chief of Staff, to help determine 
disposal of the super-machine to 
the best interests of all humanity. 
Enter idealism: all humanity will 
be united by means of impressive 
displays of power over Moscow and 
Washington by supposed ETs. 

GALAXY 



Bahnson, though, hews close to 
reality and some best-laid plans go 
mighty agley. He proposes a solu- 
tion that unfortunately relies on the 
foresight, a sadly lacking ingredi- 
ent, of present world leaders.

THE INVOLUNTARY IM- 
MORTALS by Rog Phillips. 
Avalon Books, N.Y., $2.75 

DESPITE PHILLIPS’S story, im- 
mortality isn’t dead yet, not when 
tackled by craftsmen like Heinlein 
or Simak. 

Phillips picks up his protagonists 
a few years hence, in the second 
century of their existence. A shared 
but unknown experience back in 
1848 produced several hundred 
immortals. They have since scouted 
for stragglers and experimented for 
the source of their longevity. 

Unlike the aforementioned mas- 
ters, Phillips doesn’t permit his 
people the wisdom of their years. 
They act as well as look like peren- 
nial teenagers.

THE SCIENCE FICTION 
NOVEL. Advent: Publishers, P.O. 
Box 9228 Chicago 90, 111., $3.50 

ROBERT A. HEINLEIN, C. M. 
Kornbluth, Robert Bloch and Al- 
fred Bester each delivered a lec- 
ture on the worth of science fiction 
early in 1957 at the U. of Chicago. 
Basil Davenport has added a gen- 
uinely catalytic introduction to 
these, so that the contradictori- 
nesses and mutual exclusions com- 
bine in a way that the authors 
never meant them to, for each, of 
course, has his own set of ingre- 
dients, his own measures, his own 
way of mixing. Davenport likes 
them all, and so do we. 

THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN 
THE NIGHT by Louis C. Jones. 
Hill & Wang, N.Y., $3.75 

DURING A six-year period at the 
N.Y. State College for Teachers, 
Dr. Jones collected a huge quan- 
tity of lore, legend and phenomena. 

167 



Though documented, his book is 
pegged for entertainment value; 
Dr. Jones admits to blending 
stories for enhancement. 

His haunts range from early 
colonial to post-WW II, from 
screamers to bumpers, from do- 
gooders to no-goodniks. 

THE ATOM AND THE ENER- 
GY REVOLUTION by Norman 
Lansdell. Philosophical Library, 
N.Y., $6.00 

IN OUR civilization, individuals 
consume more power than entire 
townships did not too many years 
ago. Demands upon our power re- 
sources are therefore prodigious — 
and extrapolation indicates an ut- 
terly fantastic increase in the close 
future. Moreover, fossil fuels, aside 
from increasing scarcity, must be 
reserved for chemical use. Other 
energy sources must be found. 

Lansdell’s study, though primari- 
ly concerned with nuclear energy, 
includes the latest actual and con- 
jectural data on many other 
sources.

DEATH’S 

WISHER 

BY JIM WANNAMAKER 



Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



F LINN took the seat that 
Wilmer indicated, dropped 
his overnight bag beside it, 
and tried to relax. He’d had five 
hours of inactivity on the plane, 
but the peremptory manner with 
which he had been routed out of 
his California apartment and con- 
veyed to Washington, D. C., had 
so filled his mind with unanswered 
questions that he still found rest 
to be impossible. He had been 
told simply that the government 
needed him; and when federal 
wheels started turning, there 
wasn’t much a private citizen 
could do to stop them. 

He watched the tall, lean, dark- 
haired man, who had been intro- 
duced as Dr. Jackson Wilmer, nu- 
clear physicist, disappear through 
a door. 

170 




to disarm a bomb — be at least 
a step ahead of it — 
but what if it's always 
at least a step 
ahead of you? 



Flinn looked around. 

The room in which he sat — 
comparatively small, one of hun- 
dreds in the vastness of the Penta- 
gon-seemed to be a sort of minor 
office. At least there were several 
desks and filing cabinets. Besides 
himself, there were now only two 
other men in the room. 

One, a complete stranger, sat at 
a desk across the room with his 
back turned toward Flinn. 

The other leaned against the 
wall near the door. All Flinn knew 
about him, despite the fact that 
they had been as close as boy and 
dog for the past seven hours, was 
that his name was Hayes and that 
he was a special agent of the Fed- 
eral Bureau of Investigation. 
There was a muscular hardness 
about this young man that be- 



171 



trayed an athletic background. He 
was about thirty, had a craggy face 
beneath short brown hair, hard 
gray eyes, and his nose had been 
broken at least once. There was a 
light trace of beard beginning to 
show on the agent’s face, but his 
brown summer suit still looked 
neat, and the man himself seemed 
something less than tried. 

Looking at him, Flinn felt a 
sense of his own shabbiness. He 
needed a shave as badly as his 
slacks and sports jacket needed 
pressing. 

At forty-two, Flinn was some- 
what taller than average and 
slightly underweight from over- 
work and the irregularities of a 
bachelor existence. His black hair, 
beginning to recede a little, was 
peppered with silver, and his nor- 
mally relaxed face was now tight, 
and the whites of his hazel eyes 
were bloodshot. 

T HE door beside Hayes opened 
and Wilmer entered, carrying 
a brown folder. He was in his 
shirtsleeves, his necktie pulled 
down and his collar open, and, as 
he approached, Flinn noted that 
the deeply tanned face of the 
physicist was as stubbled and 
tired-looking as his own felt. He 
was about the same age as Flinn. 

Wilmer tossed the folder on the 
desk in front of Flinn and then 
perched on one corner of the 
desk. He gazed at the parapsy- 



chologist for a long few seconds, 
his eyes startingly ice-blue in his 
dark face. 

“Well,” he said presently, “I 
guess you’re wondering what this 
is all about” 

“Yes, I guess I am,” Flinn said 
wryly. “This bird dog—” he indi- 
cated Hayes with a nod of his 
head, and the agent retaliated with 
a flash of teeth— “hauls me away 
from an important experiment, 
loads me on an Air Force jet, and, 
after a high-altitude flight at God 
only knows what kind of fantastic 
speeds, I find myself in the holiest 
of holies, surrounded by MPs and 
— yes, you might say I’m wonder- 
ing what this is all about.” 

Wilmer nodded patiently and 
rubbed one hand across his eyes. 

“When you find out, you’ll un- 
derstand the reason for the secre- 
cy.” He faced Hayes. “How long 
have we been on this thing now, 
Fred? It seems like weeks.” 

“Ten days,” the FBI man an- 
swered. 

Wilmer shook his head slowly, 
then reached for the folder, 
opened it, and took out several sci- 
entific journals that Flinn recog- 
nized instantly. The physicist 
opened one of them. 

“ ‘Advanced Experiments in TP, 
by Patrick Flinn,’” he read. He 
laid the publication aside and 
picked up another. “ ‘A Monograph 
on the Probabilities of TH,’ same 
author.” 



172 



GALAXY 



He quoted at random from the 
introductory page: “‘It is there- 
fore my belief, based upon recent 
preliminary experimentation, that 
not only can one mind be used to 
scan the thoughts of another, but 
that ideas and suggestions may be 
implanted upon another’s mind 
without the knowledge of the re- 
ceptor. This is not to be confused 
with simple telepathic ‘sending,’ 
where the receptor is completely 
aware of the other’s transmission. 
This to which I refer may, at least 
in one phase, be described as hyp- 
notic in effect. The possibilities 
of such influence over the mind- 
matter of another are more than 
somewhat considerable . .’” 

He paused, lowered the journal 
and gazed speculatively at Pat- 
rick Flinn. “Telepathy, telehyp- 
nosis,” he said, rolling out the 
words as if they left a strange 
taste in his mouth. “Very interest- 
ing. Just how much truth is there 
in all this stuff? I mean, how far 
along are you, really?” 

"C 1 LINN considered the question 
for a few seconds. It was one 
he had heard often, especially 
from his colleagues at the small 
California college where he held 
an assistantship in psychology. But 
after twenty years of skepticism— 
he had first discovered his rudi- 
mentary telepathic abilities just 
after graduating from college, and 
had been experimenting and ad- 



vancing ever since — he had be- 
come immune to criticism. 

“Very few people bother to 
read my articles,” Flinn said 
evenly, “and still fewer under- 
stand them, and the fewest believe. 
But I can tell you I’m far enough 
along in my research to know that 
the human mind has latent powers 
that are, to quote my article, more 
than somewhat considerable.” 
Wilmer and Hayes exchanged 
glances. 

“That’s fine,” Wilmer said, “but 
abstruse, wouldn’t you say? What 
I’m getting at is, I want to see a 
practical demonstration.” 

“Put up or shut up, eh?” Flinn 
said. 

“I’d rather call it an examining 
of credentials,” the physicist coun- 
tered. 

“All right. I don’t see any con- 
nection between my work and 
nuclear physics, but what do you 
want me to do? First, though, I’d 
better explain that I might fail. 
I’m really just on the threshold.” 
“Granted. So I’ll make it easy. 
Suppose — ” He looked over his 
shoulder, faced Flinn again, and 
continued in a low voice: “Sup- 
pose you tell me what the man at 
the far desk is thinking.” 

Flinn glanced past the physi- 
cist at the stranger across the 
room. The man seemed complete- 
ly unaware of the others. He was 
poring over some papers that were 
spread out upon the desk. 



DEATH'S WISHER 



173 



Flinn focused his eyes upon the 
man’s head. His mind was really 
too steeped in fatigue for this sort 
of thing, but it was a chance not 
to be missed, a chance to demon- 
strate his talents in the presence 
of a responsible scientist, so he 
willed himself into a gradually 
deepening concentration. His eyes 
seemed to go myopic, out of focus. 
A gray, ethereal haze came into 
his consciousness, like swirling 
smoke. Easy? But presently a pic- 
ture began to form, blurred at first, 
then fragmentary, then coming into 
identifiable clarity. 

Flinn held it for a moment, be- 
fore snapping back into objective 
consciousness. He was grinning 
slightly as his eyes refocused and 
came to rest on Wilmer. 

“Well?” the physicist asked. 

“What’s his name?” Flinn said. 

“Barnes. Robert Barnes.” 

“Say, Bob!” Flinn called out 
The smallish, partially bald man 
at the far desk looked up and 
swiveled around to face him. “Tell 
me something, Bob,” Flinn went 
on. “Do you act that way with all 
women, or just blondes?” 

Barnes’ placid face suddenly un- 
derwent a marvelous transforma- 
tion. First he blushed furiously. 
Then his jaw dropped open and 
the high color began to drain 
away. He stared across the room, 
his face pallid. 

“My God!” he managed to blurt 
in a stricken voice. 



r 1 1 HERE was dead silence in the 
room as Wilmer and Hayes 
looked from Barnes’ shocked face 
to Flinn’s smiling one. 

“I think it’s obvious—” Hayes 
started to say. 

“Me, too,” Wilmer agreed. He 
looked sharply at Flinn. “Can you 
tell what I’m thinking at this 
moment?” 

Flinn shrugged. “Not without a 
special effort, and I’m not going to 
make that effort unless I have to.” 
The physicist sighed and his 
tanned face relaxed a little. He 
looked at Flinn with a new respect. 
“I guess I’d better put you in the 
picture.” He reopened the folder 
and extracted several newspaper 
clippings. “What I’m about to di- 
vulge is so unbelievable that — 
well, I’d best break it to you 
gradually. You know my job. That 
fact and this tan—” he pointed to 
his face — “should give you an 
inkling of what I’ve been up to 
the last few weeks.” 

Flinn thought, and nodded. “I’m 
to assume that you’ve been out in 
the Pacific, is that right?” 

“Yes,” Wilmer said. “Eniwetok. 
Have you been following our 
progress in the papers?” 

“Not really. I’ve been a little 
too busy, I’m afraid.” 

“No matter.” The physicist 
handed the clippings to Flinn. 
“Read these.” 

Flinn scanned the first clipping. 
It bore a recent date.

read aloud, “ ‘report that a civilian,

He read the second. It was date-

that there were “no casualties,” all 
official sources are silent today 
concerning the news leak of the 
failure of a nuclear device in our 
Pacific Test Area. It has been un- 
derstood that this device, the third 
in a series of thermonuclear test 
shots, failed to detonate. Since this 
test was scheduled to have been a 
“tower shot,” under rigid instru- 
mental control, much speculation 
has arisen . 

Flinn looked up hopelessly. “I 
don’t understand. Does this con- 
cern you? I mean—” 

“It concerns all of us,” Wilmer 
said grimly. “But I know what 
you’re getting at. No, I’m not the 
man they mention. I was in charge 
of that particular test.” 

Hayes cleared his throat abrupt- 
ly and Wilmer nodded. 

“I want you to understand, Mr. 



Flinn, before we go any further, 
that everything you hear and see, 
and have heard and seen from the 
time Fred first contacted you, is 
to be held in the strictest confi- 
dence. Is that clear?” 

“Yes.” 

“All right. How much do you 
know about atomic physics?” 

LINN spread his hands. “I’m 
somewhat past the Democritus 
stage, but I don’t claim to be an 
expert.” 

“Well, basically, in a thermo- 
nuclear explosive device, hydro- 
gen is transformed into helium,” 
said Hayes. “In the process there 
is a loss of mass. This loss results 
in a tremendous and sudden re- 
lease of energy. Are you familiar 
with the energy-mass relationship, 
E = MO?” 

Flinn nodded. 

“Okay. In other words, the 
nuclei of hydrogen atoms are fused 
under the influence of great heat, 
resulting in a different element, 
less mass, a release of energy, and 
an explosion.” 

“I’m with you so far,” Flinn said. 

“Then you realize that once 
this fusion process commences, 
nothing in God’s great universe can 
stop it?” 

“Yes.” 

“And that after certain things 
are done, fusion must result?” 

“Surely.” 

“Well, so all of us believed, too.

But we were wrong about it.” 

“I don’t understand. You just 
said—” 

“So I said. But let me try to de- 
scribe to you the situation as it 
happened.” He paused, not for 
dramatic effect, but to take a mo- 
ment to force himself to recall 
what Flinn could see must have 
been a very painful experience. 

“We are on the command ship,” 
Wilmer continued, “at a safe dis- 
tance from the atoll. Everything is 
in readiness, checked and double- 
checked by me, personally. The 
automatic firing process is in prog- 
ress. The last countdown has com- 
menced. Five, four, three, two, one, 
zero. Nothing happens. 

“I’ll simplify the subsequent 
chain of events. After a reason- 
able interval, a volunteer pilot and 
myself and one other man fly by 
helicopter to the atoll. We climb 
the tower. I’m sweating and so are 
the others. We’re standing beside 
a live hydrogen bomb. I discon- 
nect the power sources and do 
various things to render the device 
safe. Then we check. Everything 
— everything— is in working order. 
There is absolutely no reason why 
the thing failed to detonate. Yet it 
did fail. 

“We fly back to the command 
ship. We hold an emergency con- 
ference. We’re sitting there star- 
ing at each other. Then this — this 
man, Dobbs, starts to laugh. We 
think it is hysterics, due to the tre- 



mendous strain that everyone has 
been under. But apparently it isn’t. 
He laughs and laughs and laughs. 
Finally he manages to say: ‘You 
can’t figure it out, can you? Well, 
I know. Old Dobbsie knows. It 
didn’t explode because I willed it 
not to!’” 

Flinn’s mind was almost too 
tired to accept what he had heard. 
“Are you trying to tell me—” 

“Figure it out for yourself,” Wil- 
mer said flatly. “It’s your field. 
Telepathy, telehypnosis, and 
what’s left?” 

“Psychokinesis,” Flinn said in a 
stifled voice. 

“Right Psychokinesis. Mind 
over matter.” 

/"ORDINARILY, Patrick Flinn 
would have used the morning 
ride over Washington’s broad 
avenues to good advantage — this 
was his first visit to the nation’s 
capital — but his mind was too 
filled with the preceding day’s 
revelations to permit anything 
save minimal sightseeing. 

“I hate to keep repeating my- 
self,” Wilmer was saying, “but I 
must be certain you understand 
what’s at stake here.” 

“I know,” Flinn answered with 
some impatience. “I’m not to re- 
veal, under any circumstances, the 
fact that I have telepathic powers.” 

“Correct.” The physicist sat in 
the seat beside Flinn, and Hayes 
was in front beside the driver.

“Your job is to find out just how 
much this man can do. We’d like 
to know the way he does it, too, 
but that’s secondary.” 

“It strikes me,” Flinn mused, 
“that anyone who can influence a 
fusion bomb can do anything.” 
“That’s what we’re afraid of.” 
Wilmer looked soberly at the para- 
I psychologist. “I think I can un- 
derstand what’s going on in your 
mind. This is your special love 
I and you’re finding it difficult to 
divorce yourself from pure clini- 
i cal investigation. You want, really, 
i to talk to Dobbs as one scientist 
to another. But I must warn 
you that this is impossible. If he 
gets the least inkling that you’re 
t a special mind, something disas- 
trous may result. As long as he 
gets what he wants, fine, but rub 
him the wrong way and—” 

“And yet you have him a vir- 

i tual prisoner and he doesn’t ob- 
ject?” 

“Well, at least not strenuously,” 
Wilmer said. “I don’t profess to un- 
| derstand a warped mind, but ap- 
parently Dobbs realizes that his 
' confinement is mostly protective 
custody. It’s to his own advantage. 
After all, he doesn’t have to stand 
up at a public forum and shout 
| threats. All he has to do is contact 
the few to reach the many. And if 
he has the powers he says he has, 
full use of them would result in 
his own destruction. And he 
doesn’t want that. He’s too inter- 



ested, right now, in satisfying his 
own animal appetites. But faced 
with losing everything—” 

“Our biggest immediate worry,” 
Hayes said from the front seat, “is 
keeping all this from the public. 
That’s why we put Dobbs out of 
sight in a hurry. There have been 
some leaks already, but so far most 
people consider the papers’ theo- 
ries as just so much wild specula- 
tion. And thank God for that. You 
can understand why all recogniz- 
able public figures are keeping as 
far away from Dobbs as possible.” 

LINN nodded; it was self-evi- 

dent. There were other phases 
of the problem that bothered him 
more. He was still vaguely and, as 
it seemed, illogically worried about 
the several questions he had raised 
the day before. 

The fact that Dobbs might 
have read his articles and hence 
might put two and two together, 
despite a cover identity, was the 
least of them. Flinn had never 
lectured in public, his efforts had 
received no publicity except in 
specialized psychological circles, 
and his latest monograph on TH 
had been published when Dobbs 
was working at the atoll. 

Wilmer, Hayes, and others had 
managed to assuage reasonable 
fears on the other point. Flinn had 
always assumed thas psychokinesis 
would be the logical result of ad- 
vanced telepathy, that they were

links in the same chain. Now it 
seemed that a person could be one 
without the other. Either you pos- 
sessed a latent ability to scan 
mind-matter, or an affinity for ma- 
terial substance, but not neces- 
sarily both. 

Earlier, Wilmer and Hayes had 
devised a test to check the possi- 
bility that Dobbs was an advanced 
telepath. They had mentally vili- 
fied him beyond the ability of even 
an accomplished actor to resist, 
over prolonged periods of time, 
and yet Dobbs had shown not the 
least indication that he had inter- 
cepted their thoughts. But there 
was one additional point. 

“You used the expression 

‘warped mind’ in describing 

Dobbs,” Flinn said to Wilmer. “Is 
it your opinion then that he is 
definitely psychopathic? The rea- 
son I ask is that scanning a con- 
fused mind may prove to be more 
than I can handle.” 

“I used that expression for want 
of a better,” Wilmer answered cau- 
tiously. “Put it this way — suppose 
you suddenly found you were able 
to control, even in a minor way, 
the stuff of the universe; would 
you use those powers for the bene- 
fit of mankind, or would you leap 
over the traces and reach for all 
the things that had been denied 
you over the years for moral, or 
legal, or whatever reasons?” 

“You paint a lurid picture,” 
Flinn said. 



They turned down a side street 
in a residential district and drew 
up in front of what appeared to be 
a large two-story private home. 

Flinn took a deep breath. He 
was rested now, but still uncertain 
whether he was up to what lay 
ahead. 

After the preliminary discussion 
with Wilmer, Hayes, and Barnes— 
the latter had proved to be a mili- 
tary intelligence man — the pre- 
vious afternoon, Flinn had been 
closeted immediately with a num- 
ber of generals, admirals, and high- 
ranking civilians from both houses 
of Congress, the Defense Depart- 
ment, the Department of State, 
and various security agencies. 

There had been the usual skep- 
ticism until he had performed 
some simple but histrionic “mind- 
reading” feats, and then there had 
been much talk about the respon- 
sibilities that had now become in- 
cumbent upon him and how per- 
haps even the fate of the nation 
was in his hands. It had left him 
wandering in a jungle of doubts 
and fears. Yet he had managed to 
sleep. 

“The wonderful ability of the 
human mind to reject unpleasant- 
ness,” he had told himself. 

As a matter of fact, he had fallen 
into deep, untroubled unconscious- 
ness within an hour of the time his 
head had first touched the pillow 
in the comfortable hotel room the 
government had provided. Hayes 



178

had been with him. “Security,” 
Hayes had said. 

And now, clean-shaven, his 
clothes neatly pressed, the sub- 
stantial breakfast still warm in his 
stomach, and fatigue no longer in 
his muscles and nerves, Flinn told 
himself that he was as ready as he 
would ever be. 

' I ^ HEY got out of the conserva- 
-*■ tive, unmarked sedan and ap- 
proached the house. There was a 
man mowing the lawn, another 
clipping hedges, and still another 
polishing a car that was parked 
in the driveway just outside the 
spacious garage. 

“How’s it going?” Hayes said to 
the hedge trimmer. 

“All quiet,” the man answered 
without looking up. 

They went around the house 
and entered unchallenged through 
a side door. It was all very casual, 
yet Flinn did not have to be told 
that they were under constant 
scrutiny. 

The room in which he found 
himself was just off the kitchen. 
Three men in working clothes sat 
around a table, drinking coffee. 
They looked up and nodded. They 
seemed to be cut from much the 
same cloth as Fred Hayes, even to 
the expression. 

“Well, well,” one of them said, 
“the brain trust.” He surveyed 
Flinn with frank interest, then 
faced Hayes. “Say, buddy, how 



does a man get a transfer out of 
this outfit?” 

Hayes grinned his wolfish grin. 
“All in good time, partner.” He 
pointed with his chin upstairs and 
raised his eyebrows. 

The man who had spoken, a 
large, broad-shouldered youngster 
with an affably homely face, got 
up, stepped back from the table, 
and went into a vaudevillian trav- 
esty of a bow. “The great man has 
been prepared and awaits your 
presence.” Then his expression 
changed. “What a party! I never 
saw so much liquor in my life! It’s 
a lucky thing the rumpus room is 
soundproof.” 

“And girls!” one of the seated 
men said. “Man, oh, man!” 

Flinn looked at Wilmer, and 
Wilmer shrugged as if to say, 
“That’s the way it is.” 

“Just don’t forget what you’re 
here for,” Hayes said harshly. 

“Don’t fret,” the big man said. 
“None of us touched a drop.” 

“Neither did Dobbs,” one of the 
seated men interjected. “I guess 
that’s the only reason he’s alive 
today.” He guffawed loudly and 
suggestively. 

Hayes leading, they entered a 
hallway and turned toward a flight 
of stairs. 

“Your boys seemed very off- 
hand about all this,” Flinn said to 
the government agent 

“Don’t kid yourself,” Hayes re- 
plied. “They’re as nervous as cats.”

it OME in, gentlemen,” Dobbs 

^ called amiably from the 
rear of the spacious bedroom. 
There was an unobtrusive man in 
a dark suit with him, but he left 
immediately. 

Now that he was face to face 
with the enigmatic Mr. Dobbs, 
Flinn felt a momentary sense of 
disappointment. 

Malcolm Dobbs sat in a straight- 
backed chair beside the large bed. 
Next to him was a table laden with 
empty breakfast dishes. Dobbs was 
dressed in an ordinary bathrobe. 
He appeared to be in his mid-for- 
ties and had a full head of dark 
hair, slightly gray at the temples. 
His mild, undistinguished face was 
only slightly less tanned than Wil- 
mer’s, and he was of average size 
and weight. His dark eyes were the 
only things that belied the man’s 
composed exterior; they were in- 
telligent, interested, and intently 
watchful. A tiny smile lingered 
upon Dobbs’ lips, as if he were 
sharing only with himself some 
form of immensely funny but emi- 
nently private joke. 

Flinn’s total impression of the 
man was that he was not the sort 
one would look at twice in a 
crowded room — under different 
circumstances. 

“Another delegation?” Dobbs 
asked. “Hello, Jack, Hayes.” 

“Mai this is Mr. Dugan,” Wil- 
mer said, indicating Flinn. “He’s 
from the government.” 



Even as he acknowledged the 
introduction, Flinn paused momen- 
tarily over the casual familiarity 
between the physicist and the ap- 
parent psychokinetic, until he was 
reminded that they were both nu- 
clear physicists and had been to- 
gether for weeks at the atoll. Flinn 
found himself wondering how close 
they had been and what thoughts 
must be going through Wilmer’s 
mind at the moment. But he 
squelched his curiosity. He was 
here to scan Dobbs’ mind, nobody 
else’s. 

“Be unobtrusive,” he had been 
warned. “Stay in the background 
as much as possible and let Wilmer 
and Hayes carry the ball. And do 
the job quickly.” 

Dobbs looked Flinn over care- 
fully, then seemed to dismiss him 
from his mind, as if he had decided 
Flinn was of no particular impor- 
tance — or no immediate threat. 

“You boys should have been 
here last night,” Dobbs smiled. “We 
had quite a party.” His smile faded 
and he added petulantly: “The 
only thing — some of the girls 
weren’t as cooperative as I had 
hoped.” 

“We’ll be more selective next 
time,” Hayes promised quickly. 

“See to it,” Dobbs said. 

They seated themselves, Hayes 
and Wilmer close to Dobbs, and 
Flinn just far enough away to seem 
deferential without raising suspi- 
cion.

“Now, what can I do for you?” 
Dobbs queried. “Another demon- 
stration, I assume?” 

“That’s right,” Wilmer said. 
“How about that disappearance 
thing again?” 

OBBS sighed. “You boys just 
can’t get it through your 
skulls that what I do isn’t some 
sort of trick, can you? Even faced 
with the evidence of the bomb.” 
Wilmer raised his hands. “It’s 
not that so much, although what 
you can do, you’ll have to admit, is 
rather unbelievable. It’s the fact 
that Mr. Dugan here has never seen 
any evidence of your powers, and 
the report he will deliver to his 
superiors may cause even more 
commotion in high places — to your 
advantage.” 

Flinn was amazed that such a 
flimsy appeal to the appetites and 
ego of a man as intelligent as Mal- 
colm Dobbs could be successful. 
Yet it not only could, it was, 

Dobbs looked again at Flinn, the 
strange smile playing upon his lips; 
then he reached across the table, 
picked up an opaque glass water 
carafe, poured out its remaining 
liquid into an empty cereal bowl, 
and replaced it on the table. 

“We don’t want water spilled 
over everything, do we?” he said. 

Wilmer slipped one arm behind 
the back of his chair and signaled 
urgently to Flinn. 

Since entering the room, Flinn 



had been gathering all his resources 
for a quick and powerful effort, and, 
at the sight of Wilmer’s waving fin- 
gers, he began. 

He was startled that, despite the 
interaction and interference of the 
other thought patterns in the room, 
he was able to make so quick a con- 
tact. Just before reaching Dobbs’ 
mind, the thought impressed itself 
upon Flinn that the reason was the 
immense mental power that was 
building within, and generating 
from, Dobbs. It was the simplest 
piece of telepathic scanning with 
which Flinn had ever been in- 
volved. 

For a matter of seconds, nothing 
happened. Then the water carafe 
abruptly disappeared, its passage 
into apparent nothingness coinci- 
dent with a faint “pop” as the air 
of the room rushed in to fill the 
vacuum. 

Dobbs turned triumphantly and 
saw Flinn still in the trancelike 
stupor of the telepath-in-contact. 
Hayes stood up to screen him, but 
Flinn shook his head and managed 
to clear his mind quickly. 

“Your friend seems somewhat 
astounded,” Dobbs chuckled. 

“My God!” was all Flinn could 
say. 

Wilmer and Hayes looked at 
him questioningly, and Hayes mut- 
tered: “I think he’s seen enough. 
Let’s get out of here.” 

“Come back anytime, gentle- 
men,” Dobbs said. 



182 



GALAXY 



His laughter followed them as 
they retreated through the door and 
down the hall to the stairs. 

U' W ELL? ” Wilmer said. 

” They sat around the table 
in the room just off the kitchen, 
steaming cups of coffee in front of 
them. The three security agents 
who had been in the room were 
gone now to their respective duties. 

Flinn gazed down into the dark 
depths of the coffee, trying to or- 
ganize his thoughts; trying to inter- 
pret and evaluate what he had seen. 

Wilmer and Hayes sipped their 
coffee, waiting with forced patience 
for the parapsychologist to speak. 

Presently, Flinn shivered and 
looked up at them. “If he says he 
can control a critical mass, or erase 
Washington, D. C., or destroy the 
nation, you’d better believe him.” 

“He’s telling the truth then,” 
Hayes said grimly. 

“Yes,” Flinn answered. “Here 
are my findings. Somehow Dobbs 
has established rapport with the 
atom. Any atom. Probably any 
number of atoms. I doubt if he 
can move one single mass in the 
ordinary conception of psycho- 
kinesis. That is, I doubt if he can 
cause a pebble, say, to shift one 
millimeter. What he can control 
are the forces that bind atoms 
into molecular structures, or that 
hold nuclei together. Do you un- 
derstand what I mean? For ex- 
ample, what he did up there just 



now was to get rid of the space 
between atoms in the molecules of 
that water carafe. I saw it clearly; 
there’s no mistake. The space 
ceased to exist, the atoms crashed 
in upon each other, and the carafe 
seemed to disappear. The mass is 
the same. It’s simply in a different 
form.” 

He paused and scanned the 
numb faces of the government 
agent and the nuclear physicist be- 
side him. 

“Let’s get down to specifics,” he 
continued. “What’s his trump card? 
What is it he’s holding over our 
heads?” 

“The atmosphere,” Wilmer said 
painfully. 

“Oxygen,” Flinn mused. “Sup- 
pose Dobbs concentrated upon the 
oxygen atoms all around us and 
caused their nuclei suddenly to 
fuse. What would happen?” 

“Nobody on the face of the 
Earth would know what hit him,” 
Wilmer said. “The Moon would 
probably be blasted out of its or- 
bit. And if there is any intelligent 
life on Mars, they’d be treated to 
a sight they’d never forget — if they 
survived it.” 

“Well, then,” Flinn said, “we’ve 
done what we came here to do. 
What’s the answer?” 

Hayes’ face set into a hard 
mask. “There’ll be a meeting of 
the brass, of course. But I can tell 
you what the result will be. I’ll be 
assigned to kill him.” 



DEATH’S WISHER 



183 



A BUZZ of excited conversa- 
tion filled the Pentagon con- 
ference room. Flinn sat in one of 
the several dozen chairs between 
Wilmer and Hayes and looked at 
a glass ashtray that lay on the part 
of the long table just in front of 
him. One day perhaps he, too, 
might be able to influence the 
molecular structure of such an 
object. Or, more likely, one of his 
descendants, because he would 
never be able to discover the 
short-cuts now. 

Planned murder. All the re- 
sources and brains of the govern- 
ment, the champion of the rights 
and dignity of the individual, 
gathered together to plot the de- 
liberate destruction of one man. 

It filled Flinn with sadness. It 
was inevitable. It had to be done. 
No one had the right to put him- 
self above the rules of social con- 
duct and the welfare of several 
billion innocent souls. And yet— 

He found himself wondering 
what the Founding Fathers would 
think of such a move. all men 
are endowed by their Creator with 
certain unalienable rights . Life, 
Liberty and the pursuit of Hap- 
piness.” Executions of criminals 
were the result of lengthy legal 
processes, during which all the 
rights of the individual were 
scrupulously observed. But this— 
was he also one of the judges? Let 
the punishment fit the crime. 
What about the judging? 



“Isn’t there some other way?” 
Wilmer broke into his thoughts. 
“That’s what you’re thinking, cor- 
rect?” 

Flinn managed a faint smile. 
“And I’m supposed to be the tele- 
path.” 

“Lef s be entirely rational about 
it,” Wilmer said. “Dobbs is a bril- 
liant man, granted. But he is also 
a lecher and a coward.” 

“There’s some of the pig and 
the wolf in every man,” Flinn said. 

“Depends on the extent,” Wil- 
mer went on. “Dobbs is way over- 
board. And he’s a craven. I know 
it’s hard to picture a man who 
voluntarily crosses a bridge into 
the unknown as anything but 
brave. I suppose there is a sort of 
bravado in it. But when he turns 
that bridge into a club to threaten 
the rest of mankind — is this 
courage?” He turned to the FBI 
man. “What do you think about it, 
Fred?” 

Hayes pulled himself out of the 
shell of disciplined impassivity 
into which he had retreated short- 
ly after passing his own unofficial 
death sentence upon Dobbs. He 
looked at the physicist and the 
parapsychologist. 

“Nothing,” Hayes said bluntly. 
“Absolutely nothing. I’m just one 
of the expendables.” 

“Aren’t we all?” Wilmer said. 
He shrugged at Flinn. “That’s why 
we were chosen originally. Me be- 
cause I was there at the atoll when 



184 



GALAXY 



all this started, and was acquainted 
with Dobbs, and capable of under- 
standing the implications of his 
acts. Hayes because—” 

“Because I’ve a good enough 
record to be above suspicion, and 
because I’m young enough not to 
be missed,” the agent said. 

“And you, Pat,” the physicist 
said to Flinn, “because of your 
unique talents. But now we’re all 
under the gun.” 

HP HERE was a lapse in the 
background noise, and the 
three turned to see the President’s 
representative rise and signal for 
order. He was a tall, graying man, 
beautifully dressed, and, as he 
spoke, there was a note of sad 
resignation in his voice. 

“So, gentlemen, since reasoning 
with Dobbs has proven to be use- 
less, we find ourselves in agree- 
ment. All that remains is to select 
the time and the method. And, 
by the way, Mr. Hilliard—” he 
nodded at the Director of the FBI 
— “has assured me there is no 
need to deviate from our original 
plan, at least so far as the human 
element is concerned. Agent 
Hayes will remain our — messen- 
ger. He seems to be ideally suited 
for the job.” 

There was a visible stir down 
the length of the table as the top 
men from the government tried 
not to look at Fred Hayes. None 
of them succeeded. Under then- 



brief, self-conscious but probing 
scrutiny, Hayes’ hard face be- 
trayed not a flicker of emotion. 

“And now the time and the 
method.” The Presidential assis- 
tant cleared his throat and scanned 
the faces of the men before him. 
“I should think as soon as pos- 
sible.” A murmur of assent swept 
the room. “There remains the 
problem of method. Dr. Wilmer 
cautions that it must be done very 
efficiently. If Dobbs even suspects 
that his life is to be forfeit at a 
predictable time — well, I hardly 
need tell you the danger. Director 
Hilliard suggests that we leave it 
up to Agent Hayes, since he 
knows his own capabilities better 
than anyone else. Mr. Hayes?” 

The tall, athletic agent rose, 
reached under his coat to his right 
hip and produced a short-barreled 
revolver. He held it up. “With 
this,” he said laconically. “In the 
head. Death will be instantaneous.” 

There were sudden protests 
from the military representatives. 

Hayes holstered the revolver 
and looked at his chief. Hilliard 
nodded, and Hayes walked to the 
end of the room. From a carton, 
he lifted a small bullet trap and 
placed it against the wall. The 
safe area inside the trap was about 
the size of an opened magazine. 
Then he moved to the conference 
table, picked up one of the ash- 
trays, returned to the trap, and 
propped the tray against it. 



DEATH'S WISHER 



185 



Appropriately, the tray was 
about the width of a man’s head. 

Agent Hayes stood up, buttoned 
his coat and began walking lei- 
surely away from the trap. At 
twenty paces, he whirled. It was 
almost too fast for the eye to fol- 
low, but the individual actions 
were these: 

With his left hand, Hayes un- 
buttoned his coat. With his right, 
he swept open the coat, turned in 
a crouch, simultaneously drew the 
revolver, and fired. The ashtray 
assumed a new identity — a scat- 
tered pile of broken glass. 

It all happened in measurably 
less than a second. 

There was a collective expira- 
tion of breath from the men around 
the table. 

"D EFORE breakfast the next 
-■-* morning, there wasn’t a single 
one of the small group of men in- 
timately involved with the top- 
priority problem who did not 
know that Hayes had failed. 

This was shocking enough in 
itself, but what made it even more 
so was the fact that Hayes was 
still alive to tell it— and that any- 
one else was there to hear him. 

“I came as close as hell to 
swearing,” Hayes said dully to 
Wilmer and Flinn. 

Neither of them needed any 
special powers of observation to 
see that the young agent was 
shaken. The three sat in the small 



Pentagon office. Coffee had been 
served, and they were waiting now 
for a quorum of the governmental 
officials to gather. 

“I had it lined,” Hayes con- 
tinued. “I’d waited half the night 
for everything to be just right. I 
was in a good position, close and 
to one side. Dobbs was as relaxed 
as I’ve ever seen him. I was just 
telling myself ‘Now 1 when Dobbs 
looked directly at me and grinned. 
‘If you’re planning on doing any- 
thing rash, my friend, don’t. You 
can’t possibly kill me swiftly 
enough to keep from destroying 
yourself, every person in this 
room, every man, woman, and 
child in this city, and every living 
thing on the face of this Earth.’ 
What could I do?” 

“Thank God you didn’t figure 
it was just a bluff!” Wilmer ex- 
claimed. “Pulling that trigger 
would have been the greatest blun- 
der in history.” 

“Move and countermove,” Flinn 
mused. “It was our gambit and 
we were checked before we 
started.” 

“So I got on the open line and 
told the boys to fetch Flinn as 
quickly as possible,” Hayes went 
on. “But I still don’t understand. 
I’d swear that man read my mind.” 

“I don’t think so,” Flinn said. 
“I’ve had two mental contacts with 
Dobbs, and neither time did I get 
the least suggestion that he was 
telepathic.”

GALAXY 



“No need for him to be,” Wil- 
mer said. “It doesn’t take a smart 
man to put two and two together 
and arrive at four. And this man 
is more than merely smart.” 

“I suppose you’re right,” Hayes 
said, “but it sure knocked the 
props out from under me.” 

r 1 1 HEY were all in attendance, 
most of them looking rumpled 
and gritty from lack of sleep and 
the realization that they had been 
beaten. 

“I just don’t know,” a senator 
said wearily. “First a man who 
can influence matter, then one 
who reads minds, and now the lat- 
ter tells us the former is inviol- 
able. It’s too much for me.” 

“I refuse to accept defeat!” a 
fleet admiral thundered, bringing 
his fist down upon the table explo- 
sively. He was an erect, bristling 
man with an aggressive combat 
record in two wars. “We’ve lost 
the first round — so what? There 
will be others.” 

“I quite agree,” the Presiden- 
tial assistant said. “This man must 
be destroyed. Already he’s begin- 
ning to make impossible demands.” 
“But how do we go about it?” a 
congressman said. “Personally, I 
think we’re licked. As far as I 
can see, the best thing to do is let 
him have his head and hope for 
the best.” 

“Hope for the best?” a man 
from a security agency echoed in- 



credulously. “It’s power Dobbs 
wants — recognized power. He 
wants to be feared and worshipped. 
Sooner or later he’ll let everyone 
know. His egotism will force it 
Can you conceive of what that 
would mean? For myself, I’d 
rather see the entire human race 
disappear in one flash of fire with- 
out ever knowing what hit it than 
live under the thumb of the fear 
of destruction!” 

“Gentlemen!” The Presidential 
assistant rapped for order. “Let’s 
examine the situation rationally 
and seek out the flaws. There must 
be some somewhere. Nothing in 
the mind of man is perfect.” 

“Well, this comes as close as 
anything,” Wilmer interjected. 
“You ask what’s wrong with the 
direct approach — why not shoot 
him while he sleeps? Well, I’ll an- 
swer with some questions. Have 
any of you died as the result of a 
bullet in the brain? Have you 
ever questioned anyone who has 
been killed in that manner? Then 
how do we know there isn’t a 
microsecond of awareness before 
life is extinguished? And even — 
or especially — on the subcon- 
scious level, isn’t this enough time 
for a preset signal? What’s the 
time-lag between countdown zero 
and the explosion of a thermo- 
nuclear bomb?” 

“Apparently he has us blocked 
in every way,” Flinn picked up 
Wilmer ’s argument. “Asleep or 



DEATH’S WISHER 



187 



awake. Conscious or unconscious. 
It’s all the same. Think of it as a 
special circuit in his mind. Destroy 
Dobbs, the circuit shorts, and 
this preset signal to the oxygen 
atoms is sent, their nuclei fuse, 
and that’s the end of everything.” 

He scanned the faces of the 
men around the conference table. 
“Or think of it as a hypnotic sug- 
gestion. Under hypnosis, an indi- 
vidual is given a certain order that 
he is to carry out whenever a cer- 
tain set of circumstances or stimuli 
occurs. No matter when this hap- 
pens, no matter what he is doing 
or thinking when the moment ar- 
rives, the subject reacts according 
to the order buried in his sub- 
conscious.” 

“But for every move there is a 
countermove,” the admiral argued. 
“This is a situation. A fantastic 
one, but a situation. There has to 
be an answer.” 

“I think there is,” Flinn said 
carefully, “but it could be very 
risky.” 

I T was up to the committee now. 

The decision rested squarely 
in the lap of the United States 
Government. Flinn had stated his 
ideas, presented his plan, and 
tried to give the odds — although 
in his heart he knew that was im- 
possible — so it was now out of 
his hands. 3 

Or was it? 

The parapsychologist lay on 



the bed in his hotel room, trying 
to relax, trying to store up energy 
for the ordeal that might be im- 
minent. Hayes and Wilmer were 
in the room, too, awaiting word 
from the heavily guarded confer- 
ence chamber in the Pentagon. 

The thin physicist paced up and 
down, his tanned face a study in 
strain. Wilmer had been with this 
as long as anyone, except Dobbs, 
and Flinn found himself wonder- 
ing what deep inner resources the 
man had tapped to retain his 
sanity. 

The big federal agent slouched 
in a chair, looking at nothing. He 
had lapsed again into the welcome 
protection of training and disci- 
pline. 

Several times during the past 
thirty hours, since presenting his 
plan, Flinn had had to restrain 
himself from probing the minds 
of his two associates. At a time 
like this, no one had the right to 
invade another’s privacy. And 
curiosity had to give way for an- 
other reason — just one look into 
either of their minds might be 
enough to weaken or shatter his 
own resolve. 

The classic dilemma. Do noth- 
ing and face a living hell. Act and 
court destruction. The very sim- 
plicity of the alternatives made 
the problem intolerable. 

Telehypnosis — the untried hy- 
pothesis. 

Good Lord! Flinn told himself. 



188 



GALAXY 



I’m not even proficient as a tele- 
path yet! 

Outside, he could hear the mur- 
mur of the city — the traffic, the 
people, moving along their sepa- 
rate paths to their own destina- 
tions in the humid afternoon heat. 

Well, anyway, once the com- 
plete curtain of security had fallen, 
there had been no more leaks. 
Proving that if a secret was big 
enough, it could be kept. 

Another classic problem. Do 
the people have the right to be 
informed? Does forewarned really 
mean forearmed? And how about 
the other nations of the world? 

4 N hour after the dinner dishes 
had been cleared away by 
the government agent dubbing as 
a room-service waiter, the tele- 
phone rang with an awful insis- 
tency. 

Wilmer was the closest, but 
Hayes beat him to it by a full 
stride. 

After identifying himself, Hayes 
listened in silence. Then he said, 
“All right,” and replaced the re- 
ceiver. 

He nodded at Wilmer and 
Flinn. 

“It’s go ahead.” He paused and 
his face seemed to change— to re- 
lent somehow. “And they wanted 
me to relay this message: The 
President says, ‘May God be with 
you.’ ” 

Flinn felt very alone and very 



close to something terrible. 

In the gloom of the darkened 
bedroom that adjoined Dobbs’, he 
could see Wilmer silhouetted 
against the meager light that came 
through the curtained window 
from the street lamp outside and 
Hayes was out in the hall. But 
the knowledge of the proximity of 
the two men did nothing to lessen 
Flinn’s loneliness. The committee 
had even couched it as an order, 
trying to relieve him of that small 
burden, but if he failed, who would 
remain to accept the blame? 

A few times in his forty-two 
years had Flinn wondered how it 
would feel to have the fate of the 
world riding upon his shoulders. 
Now he knew and wished he 
didn’t. 

The door opened silently and 
Hayes eased in. 

“He’s asleep,” the agent 
breathed in a barely audible voice. 
“You can start anytime now.” 

The plan was simple, decep- 
tively so. 

Since Dobbs’ block was a kind 
of self-hypnotic thing, why not 
countermand it with a deeper 
hypnotic suggestion introduced by 
telepathy? If it could be done 
and was strong enough, the second 
would counteract the first. At least 
for a short time. 

There were terrifying flaws — 
the first one obvious, the second 
not so easily seen. 

Suppose Dobbs’ block had in- 



DEATH’S WISHER 



189 




herent within it an anti-disturb- 
ance feature that might react to 
any interference, including hyp- 
notism in any form? Then the re- 
sult would be an immediate 
“short-circuit” and — disaster. 

Trembling with the responsi- 
bility that was upon him, Flinn 
forced himself into a deep con- 
centration, an almost cataleptic 
trance. All details of the room 



faded from his consciousness. 
There was the familiar gray, 
swirling mist, and, for what 
seemed an intolerably long time, 
he fought to make contact with 
the sleeping man’s mind. He al- 
most sobbed aloud from the ef- 
fort. 

Then at last he found it, en- 
tered, and gradually pushed down 
through the subconscious. 

GALAXY 



H E was seeking now, probing 
for the deep-seated level of 
the block that he had discovered 
the second time he had investi- 
gated Dobbs’ mind. 

It was very difficult with the 
sleeping man and, before he found 
it, more than once he felt himself 
standing on the precipice of the 
unknown, close to slipping away 
into a fright-filled nothingness. 

DEATH’S WISHER 





Finally, he had it, clear and 
cold. The strange, unhuman, in- 
scrutable area that was in dia- 
bolical rapport with the basic stuff 
of one element of the atmosphere. 
Flinn lingered there for a while, 
wondering again why he could 
not read it completely, then 
forced himself on and on, deeper 
and deeper, until at last he felt 
the limit had been reached. 



190 



191 






His own warning thought in- 
truded, telling him that this was 
the place. And the time for the 
first test was at hand. He could 
not afford the luxury of another 
pause. His resolve might crack... 

The thought arced like a high- 
voltage spark, the preamble of the 
counter-suggestion: You are to do 
nothing. No matter what happens, 
no matter what is done to you, 
you are to take no action whatso- 
ever. You are not to react. You are 
to do nothing. You are to disre- 
gard every thought but this. 

The battle had been joined. 
The interference had bridged the 
gap — yet the block remained 
dormant! 

The first hurdle had been 
cleared. 

For the better part of three 
hours, Flinn continued to transmit 
the counter-suggestion. Although 
he was not aware of it, sweat 
rolled from every pore of his body 
and his nerves spasmed in unfelt 
agony. 

Something happened. 

Flinn lost contact as a shrill of 
warnings welled through Dobbs’ 
mind. 

A second later, the door opened 
and Hayes’ voice hissed: “He’s 
awake!” 

Flinn returned to awareness 
slowly. First he was conscious only 
of how tired he was, and then he 
knew that a voice was trying to 
reach him, and he felt a handker- 



chief swabbing at his face. 

Wilmer bent over him in the 
gloom. 

Hayes said in Flinn’s ear: 
“Dobbs is awake. He knows some- 
thing’s wrong. He’s moving around 
in there.” 

“Then go ahead,” Flinn heard 
his voice say. “There won’t be a 
better time.” 

“Maybe we should wait,” Wil- 
mer cautioned. 

“No! Do it now. Hurry!” 

The agent stiffened, stepped 
back, and disappeared. 

They heard the door to Dobbs’ 
room open and close and the 
sound of voices. 

There was an exclamation, then 
Dobb’s voice shouting: “What are 
you doing? Are you crazy? I warn 
you, I’ll take every one of you 
with me!” Then a sudden explo- 
sion, muffled, but still shocking- 
ly loud, and the thump of a heavy 
object falling. 

Flinn could not bring himself 
to move a muscle. 

HP HE silence seemed absolute. It 
was as if even the house itself 
were listening, straining, prepar- 
ing itself for the inevitable. 

One second passed. 

Two. 

Five. 

Ten. 

Nothing happened. 

Abruptly, Wilmer shouted: “It’s 
all over!” 



192 



GALAXY 



Flinn heard footfalls upon the 
stairs and the sound of excited 
voices. 

Hayes burst into the room and 
turned on the light, the .357 mag- 
num still in his hand. His face was 
pale; his mouth worked, but no 
sound emerged. 

Flinn found that his muscles 
would obey him now, and he stood 
up and headed for the door. He 
felt numb, drained. He stepped 
out into the hall. Every special 
agent and security man on the 
premises was crowded there. 

Flinn turned back to Hayes. 

“I never thought to ask before,” 
Flinn said. “Dobbs — did he have 
any close living relatives? A wife? 
Children?” 

Hayes shook his head. 

“Thank God for that!” Flinn 
said. 

He started down the hall toward 
the stairs. The men there grew si- 
lent as he approached and moved 



soundlessly out of his way. 

He went down the stairs, 
through the room off the kitchen, 
and outside to the driveway. He 
looked up at the dark sky. 

It’s over, he told himself. And 
now I’m a murderer. All of us are. 
A guilt shared by the few to save 
the many. But the few are the 
product of the many, just as each 
individual is, so where are we to 
place the blame? 

Twenty years of research, and 
where had it led? 

Somewhere he had failed as so- 
ciety had failed, and, even in suc- 
cess, Flinn could feel no flush of 
victory. 

The Earth was safe, but every 
human upon it had died a little 
without even knowing it. 

Yes, ifs over, Flinn thought fi- 
nally. For now. Until the next time. 

He could see no stars. In a 
while it would be dawn.

terms what these gifts of the labora- 
tory will mean. 

Who’s going to try it? 

How about you? 

F OR there is a turnover in maga- 
zines that seems to run in a five 
or ten-year cycle. Every magazine 
knows it. Sometimes the period is 
longer, sometimes less; but over a 
few years there will be almost a 
whole new body of readers and a 
corresponding change in the names 
appearing on the contents pages. 

Science fiction is peculiarly for- 
tunate in hanging onto some of its 
best people — Clifford D. Simak 
and Murray Leinster, who go back 
almost to the very beginning of 
magazine science fiction; Heinlein, 
Asimov, Pohl and a number of 
others with more than twenty years 
of service. But these are the excep- 
tions. The magazine of a decade 
ago will show a major fraction of 
names which no longer appear on 
any contents page in the field. 

Some go on to other fields, turn- 
ing to writing books or even turn- 
ing away from writing altogether. 
Some just don’t have the stamina 
or the ingenuity to keep up. A few 
(including, in the recent past, some 
of the very best, like Kuttner and 
Kornbluth) are lost to us through 
death. 

Tomorrow’s writers come from 
today’s readers. We know that in 
any given month from ten to a 

194 



hundred readers will sit down at a 
typewriter, shrug, say, “Why not?” 
and plunge ahead. 

Why not, indeed? But let’s make 
it easy on both of us. There’s ideas 
enough for a million stories (give 
or take a few hundred thousand) 
in the new developments of today’s 
exploding technology. Let’s use 
them! 

"D IPELESS pipes and screens of 
magneto-hydrodynamic force, 
lighting from windows, interstellar 
travel. Sound familiar? They do to 
oldtimers, for that sort of thing oc- 
curred in the science fiction stories 
of a few years back. Now that 
we’ve got them, let’s find out what 
they’re going to do to our way of 
life . and then let’s go on to the 
things that aren’t in the labora- 
tories yet. 

For science fiction has to stay 
ahead of fact. Once we’ve absorbed 
the technical reports, we have to 
extrapolate to the next big jump. 
It aqua-therms work in water, can 
something of the sort work to pro- 
vide spacemen with air? If we can 
get light from windowpanes, can’t 
we get it from the ambient atmo- 
sphere itself? 

And then— what hapens to the 
people involved, their habits and 
their conflicts? 

That’s the question — and our 
writers, old and new, have to pro- 
vide the answers!
