Concerning Worms and Serpents 



S ome years ago If published a 
story by James McConnell called 
Learning Theory. It had to do with 
a man who finds himself running a 
maze; he has been abducted from 
Earth by some more potent and in- 
telligent creatures whose principal 
interest in Earthmen is in seeing 
if we are intelligent at all. So they 
put our hero to the standard tests 
that we humans give to guinea 
pigs, mice and worms. 

It was a good story. Indeed, it 
had every reason to be. Not only 
was (and is) McConnell a firsb- 
elass writer, but in his incarnation 
as Dr. James V. McConnell he is 
professor of psychology at the Men- 
tal Health Research Institute at the 
University of Michigan — and thus 
an old maze runner from way back. 

McConnell’s mazes are most usual- 
ly being run by planarian worms; 
in fact, you might say that every 
bit of the stature and dignity that 
planarian worms have in the eyes 
of science today is due to the efforts 
of Jim McConnell. Until a few 
years ago, nobody paid much at- 
tention to planarians. They are 
neither particularly pretty nor par- 
ticularly smart. But they do learn 
— sort of. At least, they are capable 
of acquiring a Pavlovian reflex if 
you know how to go about handling 
them. 

Suppose, for example, you give 
a planarian a mild electric shock. 



He will respond by contracting 
slightly. 

If you simultaneously apply elec- 
tric shock and bright light, and 
repeat them together often enough 

— oh, let’s say forty or fifty times 

— then something happens in the 
worm’s nervous system that is some- 
thing like learning. He begins to 
associate shock and light, and 
reaches a point where he will con- 
tract if you give him just the light. 
He has learned a response. 

All right; so far so good; but 
Pavlov did the same thing with 
dogs and bells half a century ago. 
What makes the planarian the celeb- 
rity he is today is that if you 
then take a highly trained, light- 
reacting planarian; chop him up 
into small pieces; feed him to an- 
other, totally untrained planarian 
. • and if you then give the second 
planarian, the cannibal one, the 
same series of stimuli . why, 
then the second planarian learns 
the shrinking lesson in only per- 
haps a dozen tries instead of forty 
or fifty. 

In other words, some part of the 
“memory” of the cannibal planarian 
was acquired through his digestive 
system. He has eaten himself an 
education. 

This is fact, not joke. But there 
are jokes in Jim McConnell too, and 
one of the evidences of his sense 
of humor is the scientific journal 



4 





he has been publishing on and off 
for nearly ten years, called The 
Worm Runner* 8 Digest, 

The Digest may not be the most 
important technical periodical being 
printed today, but it may well be 
the most widely read. It's certainly 
the funniest. And what brings all 
this to mind at this time is that 
the publishing firm of Prentice 
Hall has just had the wisdom to 
get McConnell to put together an 
anthology of the best from The 
Worm Runner* 8 Digest, 

The title of the book is The Worm 
Re-Tums, We enjoyed it. You will 
too! 

M cConnell's planarians are an 
example of scientific fact that 
sounds like a hoax. A gallery of 
scientific hoaxes that sound like 
fact, on the other hand, is in Robert 
Silverberg's Scientists and Scoun- 
drels, just out from Crowell. 

As Silverberg says in his intro- 
duction, ‘^This is, in a way, a book 
of science fiction — or at any rate, 
a book of fictional science." Among 
his scientists and scoundrels are 
accounts of Atlantis-hunters and 
sculpture-forgers; of the Great 
Moon Hoax that had all America 
looking toward alien intelligences in 
the sky a century before science- 
fiction magazines ever appeared ; 
and of that most impressive of flim- 
flams, the Piltdown Man. If you 
are going to play a practical joke, 
that is the scale to play it on! 
Whoever joined man's cranium to 
ape's jaw, pickled the mixture in 
aging solution and passed it off as 
an authentic fossil, is surely still 
laughing in some unmarked grave. 

Still, we would enter a demurrer 
or two against some of Silverberg's 
charges. Item: Silverberg says flat- 
ly that Dr. Cook never reached the 



North Pole and that it was all a 
hoax concocted for the sake of fame 
and profit. We're not so sure. (Wo 
should point out, by the way, that 
the Frederick J. Pohl mentioned in 
Silverberg's book as snppor^g 
Cook's claims is not the undersigned, 
but an older and undoubtedly wiser 
Pohl; coincidentally, we are more 
of this other Pohl's view on this 
matter than of Silverberg's.) 

And this same Frederick J. Pohl, 
as it happens, introduced us some 
years ago to a man named Hjalmar 
Holand, who Silverberg thinks was 
a well meaning but credulous char- 
acter, taken in by some forged ar- 
cheological evidence and persuaded 
that the Vikings a thousand years 
ago left carved runes on a stone 
in Minnesota. 

Holand may well have been 
wrong. It is hard to see just how 
Vikings could have got that far in- 
land — or why — or what became of 
them if they did. But credulous 
Holand was not, nor was he any- 
body's dupe. 

As to how the Vikings got there, 
Holand wrote a fictional account of 
their journey in a wondrously in- 
teresting novel which we read in 
manuscript and hope someone will 
sooner or later have the wit to 
publish. 

As to what they were doing 
there — well, we know one thing 
about the Vikings: Anywhere they 
could go, they did go. And as to 
what became of them . that's 
hard to say; but one thing Holand 
told us that bears on that is the 
persistent, and otherwise inexplic- 
able, Minnesota tradition of a tribe 
of blue-eyed Indians who lived in 
that area in the early nineteenth 
century! 

But Silverberg's book is fun any- 
how ... — THE EDITOR

B arbara Ellington felt the touch 
as she straightened up from 
the water cooler. It was the lightest 
of touches, but quite startling — 
momentary, tiny flick of some- 
thing ice-cold against the muscle of 
her right arm at the shoulder. 

She twisted quickly and rather 
awkwardly around from the cooler, 



& JAMES H. SCHMITZ

then stared in confusion at the small 
well-dressed, bald-headed man who 
stood a few feet behind her, evi- 
dently awaiting his turn for a drink. 

“Why, good afternoon, Barbara,” 
he said pleasantly. 

Barbara was now feeling embar- 
rassment. “I . ” she began incoher- 
ently. “I didn’t know anyone else 
was near. Dr. Gloge. I’m finished 
nowl”

She picked up the briefcase she 
had set against the wall when she 
stopped for a drink and went on 
dong the bright-lH corridor. S3ie was 
a tall, lean-^odied gkl — perhaps a 
little too taH but, with her serious 
face and smooth, brown hdr, not 
unattractive. At the moment, her 
cheeks burned. She knew she walked 
with wooden, self-conscious stiff- 
ness, wondering if Dr. doge was 
peering after hex, puzzled bjr her 
odd behavKM* at the water cooler. 

''But something did touch nie,^ 
she thought. 

At the turn of the anridor, she 
glanced back. Dr. Gk>ge had had 
his drink, and was wdking off un- 
hurriedly in the opposite direction. 
Nobody else was in sight. 

After die’d turned the comer, 
Barbara reached up with her left 
hand and rubbed the area of her 
upper arm where she had felt that 
tiny, noomeiriary needle of ice. Had 
Dr. doge been responsible for — 
well, for whaterer it had been? She 
frowned and riiook her head. She’d 
worked in Qk>ge’s office for two 
weeks immecfiatdy after riie’d been 
employed here. And Dr. Henry 
Gloge, head of the bicdogy secti<m 
at Research A%)ba, while invariably 
polite, even courteous, was a cold, 
quiet, withdrawn character, com- 
pletely devoted to his work. 

He was not at all the kind of man 
who would consider it humorous to 
play a prank on a stenographer. 

A nd it hadn’t, in fact, been a 
prank. 

From Dr. Henry Gloge’s point of 
view, the encounter with Barbara 



Ellington in the fifth floor hallway 
that afternoon had been a very 
fortunate accident. A few weeks 
earlier he had selected her to be 
one of two unwitting subjects for 
Point Omega Stimulation. 

His careful plans had included a 
visit to her bedroom apartment when 
she was not there. He had installed 
equipment that might, be of value 
later in his experiment. And it was 
not until these preliminaries were 
accomi^ished that he had headed 
for the steno pool, only to find that 
Barbara had been transferred out 
of the department. 

Gloge dared not risk inquiring 
about her. For if the experiment 
had undesirable results, no one must 
suspect a connection between a low- 
ly typist and himself. And even if 
it were successful, secrecy mi^t 
continue to be necessary. 

Gloge chafed at the delay. When 
on the fourth day of his search for 
her he suddenly recognized her 
walking al<mg a hallway fifty feet 
ahead of him, it seemed as if fate 
was on his side after all. 

As the girl paused at a water 
cooler, he came up behind her. 
Quickly, he made sure that no one 
else was in view. Then he drew the 
needle jet gun and aimed it at her 
shoulder muscles. The gun carried 
a gaseous compound of the Omega 
serum, and tfie only sign of a dis- 
charge, when he fired it, was a thin 
line of mist from the needle end to 
her skin. 

His task then accomplished, Gloge 
hastily slipped the Instrument into 
the holster inside his coat and but- 
toned his coat.

B arbara, still carrying her brief- 
case, presently came to tibe 
offices of John Hammond, special 
assistant to the president of Research 
Alpha, which lay on the fifth floor 
of what was generally considered 
the most important laboratory com- 
plex on Earth. Alex Sloan, the 
president, was on the floor above. 

Barbara paused before the mas- 
sive black door with Hammond’s 
name on it. She gazed possessively 
at the words Scientific Liaison and 
Investigation lettered on the panel. 
Then she took a small key from her 
briefcase, slipped it into the door 
lock and pressed to the right. 

The door swung silently back. 
Barbara stepped dirough into the 
outer office, heard the faint click 
as the door closed behind her. 

There was no one in sight. The 
desk of Helen Wendell, Hammond’s 
secretary, stood across the room 
with a number of papers on it. The 
door to the short haH which led to 
Hammond’s private office was open. 
From it Barbara heard Helen’s 
voice speaking quiedy. 

Barbara EHmgton had been as- 
signed to Hammond — actually, to 
Helen Wendell — only ten days be- 
fore. Aside from the salary increase, 
part of her interest in the position 
had been the intriguing if somewhat 
alarming figure of John Hammond 
himself, and an expectation that she 
would find herself in the center of 
the behind-the-scene operations of 
Scientific Liaison and Investigation. 
In that, she had so far been dis- 
appointed. 

Barbara walked over to Helen 
Wendell’s desk, took some papers 



from her briefcase, and was putting 
them into a basket when her eye 
caught the name of Dr. Henry 
Gloge on a note in the adjoining 
basket. Entirely on impulse — be- 
cause she had seen the man only 
minutes before — she bent over the 
paper. 

The note was attached to a re- 
port. It was a reminder to Hammond 
that he was to see Dr. Gloge today 
at three-thirty in connection with 
Gloge’s Omega projfect. Barbara 
glanced automatically at her watch; 
it was now five minutes to three. 

Unlike most of the material she 
handled, this item was at least partly 
understandable. It referred to a 
biological project, “Point Omega 
Stimulation.” Barbara couldn’t re- 
member having heard of such a pro- 
ject while she was working under Dr. 
Gloge. But that was hardly surpris- 
ing — the biological section was one 
of the largest in Research Alpha. 
From what she was reading, the pro- 
ject had to do with “the acceleration 
of evolutionary processes” in several 
species of animals, and the only real 
information in the report seemed to 
be that a number of test animals 
had died and been disposed of. 

Was the great John Hammond 
spending his time on this sort of 
thing? 

Disappointed, Barbara put the 
report back into the basket and 
went on to her own office. 

A s sfhe sat down at her desk, 
Barbara noticed a stack of 
papers which hadn’t been there when 
she had left on her errand. Attached 
to them was a note in Helen’s large.

dear handwriting. The note said: 
Barbara, 

This came in unexpectedly and 
must be typed today. It obvi- 
ously win require several hours 
of overtime. If you have made 
special arrangements for the 
evening, let me know and 111 
have a typist sent up from the 
pool to do this extra woric. 

Barbara felt an instant pang of 
possessive jealousy. This was her 
job, her office! She definitely did not 
want some other girl coming in. 

Unfortunately, she did have a 
date. But to keep an intruder from 
taking her place in John Hammond’s 
office, even if only for a few hours, 
was the more important matter. 
That was her instant decision, need- 
ing no second thought. But she sat 
still a moment, biting her lip; for 
that moment she was a woman con- 
sidering how to put off a male who 
had a quick temper and no patience. 
Then ^e picked up the telephone 
and dialed a number. 

For some months now, Barbara 
had settled her hopes for &e future 
on Vince Strather, a tedmician m 
the photo lab. When his voice came 
on the telephone, she told hfan what 
had happened, finished contritely, 
“I’m afraid I can’t get out of it very 
well, Vince, so soon after starting 
here.” 

She could almost feel Vince ab- 
sorbing the impact of the denial she 
was conununicating; she had dis- 
covered quickly in their brief ro- 
mance that he was trying to move 
her towards premarital intimacy, a 



step she was wholly determined not 
to take. 

She was relieved now, when he 
accepted her explanation. She re- 
place the receiver, feeling very 
warm toward him. “I really do love 
him!” she thought 

It was a few moments later that 
she suddenly felt dizzy. 

T he feeling was peculiar, not like 
her usual headaches. She could 
f^l it build up, a giddy, light 
swirling which seemed both within 
and without her, as if she were 
weightless, about to drift out of the 
chair, turning slowly over and over. 

Almost simultaneously, she be- 
came aware of a curious exhilara- 
tion, a sense of strength and well- 
being, quite unlike anything she 
could remember. The sensations con- 
tinued for perhaps twenty seconds 
. then they faded and were gone, 
almost as abruptly as they had come. 

Confused and somewhat shaken, 
Barbara straighteeaed up in her 
chair. Foi a moment she considered 
taking aspiiln. But there seemed no 
reason for that. She didn’t feel ill. 
It even seemrd to her that she felt 
more awake and s;)(ert. 

She was about to return to her 
typing when she became aware of a 
movement out of the comer of her 
eye. She looked up and saw that 
John Hammond had paused in the 
doorway of her little office. 

Barbara froze, as she always did 
in his presence, then sdowly she 
turned to face him. 

Hammond stood th^e, staring at 
her thoughtfully. He was a man 
about six feet t^, wi^ dark brown

rials to the storeroom at this hour. 

Peering through the slats of a 
crate. Dr. Gloge watched Strather’s 
approach. He was, he realized, much 
more tense and nervous now than he 
had been when he had given Barbara 
the injection. Of himself, Vincent 
Strather was not the kind of subject 
Dr. Gloge would have chosen — the 
young man was too angry, too bitter. 
But the fact that he was Barbara’s 
friend and that they spent their 
spare time together, should be useful 
in the further steps of the experi- 
ment — so it seemed to Dr. Gloge. 

Sliding his hand under his coat 
where the jet gun rested, he moved 
quickly out into the passage and 
across it toward Vince Strather 

Even as he pressed the trigger, he 
knew his nervousness had betrayed 
him. 

The needle tip of the gun had 
been too far away from Strather; 
a foot; almost two feet too far. At 
that greater distance the jet stream, 
emerging from the needle at nearly 
a thousand miles an hour, had time 
to spread and slow down. It caught 
Strather high up on the shoulder 
blade and tugged at his skin as it 
entered. For Strather, the sensation 
must have been that of a sharp 
impact. He jumped and cried out, 
then stood shuddering, as if in 
shock — long enough for Gloge to 
slip the little gun back into its holster 
and close up his coat. 

But that was all. Vince Strather 
whirled. His hands caught Gloge by 
the arms, and his angry face glared 
down into the Doctor’s. 

“You damn jerk!” he shouted. 
“What did you hit me with just now? 



Who the hell arc you, anyway?" 

For a moment. Dr. Gloge fdl 
appalled. Then he tried to twist out 
of Strather’s hard grip. "I don*t 
know what you’re talking about!” he 
said breathlessly. 

He stopped. He saw that Vince 
was gazing past his should^. The 
young man’s grip relaxed suddenly, 
and Gloge was a^le to free hknself. 
He turned and looked behind him. 
He felt a stunned, incredulous dis- 
may. 

J ohn Hammond was coming 
along the passage, gray eyes 
fastened questioningly upon them. 
Gloge could only hope desperately 
that he had not been in sight when 
the gun was being fired. 

Hammond came up and said in a 
tone of easy authority: “Dr. Gloge, 
what’s going on here?” 

“Doctor!” Vince Strather repeated, 
in a startled voice. 

Gloge put puzzled indignatkm in 
his tone: “This young man appears 
to be und^ the impression that I 
struck him just now. Needless to 
say, I did nothing of the kind and 
don’t imderstand what gave him such 
an idea.” 

He looked ftownin^y ba<± at 
Strather. Strathcr’s gaze shifted un- 
certainly between them. He was 
obviously abated by John Ham- 
mond’s presence and Gloge’s tide 
but not yet over his anger. 

He said sadenly, “Well, something 
hit me. At least k felt that wajrl 
When I looked around, he was 
standing there. So I thought he’d 
done it.” 

“I was passing you,” Dr. Gloge 

ir 



12 




corrected him. “You exclaimed some- 
thing and I stopped.” He shrugged, 
smiled. “And that’s all I did, young 
man! I certainly had no reason to 
strike you.” 

Strather said grudgingly, “I guess 
I was mistaken.” 

Dr. Gloge said promptly, “Then 
let’s call it an error and forget it!” 
He held out his hand. 

Strather reached out reluctantly 
and shook it, then looked at Ham- 
mond. When Hammond remained 
silent, he turned away in obvious 
relief, took one of the boxes from 
the truck and disappeared into the 
storeroom with it. 

Hammond said, “I was on my way 
to your office. Doctor, where I 
expect to have an interview with 
you in a few minutes on the Omega 
project. I presume you were heading 
m that direction.” 

“Yes, yes.” Gloge fell into step 
beside the bigger man. He was 
thinking: “Did he see anything?” 
His companion gave no sign. 

A few minutes later, as he gazed 
across the gleaming desk of 
his private office at John Hammond, 
Gloge had the uneasy feeling of a 
criminal confronted by the law. It 
had always amazed him that this 
man — Hammond — could make 
him feel at very least like a small 
boy. 

Yet the discussion that now de- 
veloped began with a reassuring 
statement from the bigger man: 
“This is a completely informal 
conversation. Doctor. I am not 
representing President Sloan at the 
moment — even less the Board of 



Regents. That has been deliberately 
arranged. It will make it possible for 
both of us to speak quite frankly.” 
Dr. Gloge said, “Have there been 
complaints about my work here?” 
Hammond nodded. “You can’t 
have remained entirely unaware of 
it. Doctor. You’ve been asked to 
amplify your project reports, make 
them more detailed and specific, 
three times within the last two 
months alone.” 

Gloge was reluctantly deciding 
that he would have to tell some of 
his data. 

He said with apparent openness, 
“My reluctance to communicate has 
been due to a strictly scientific 
dilemma. Things were happening in 
the experiment but their meaning 
was not clear to me until very re- 
cently.” 

“There is a feeling,” said Ham- 
mond in his steady voice, “that your 
project is failing.” 

Dr. Gloge said sharply, “The 
accusation is unworthy!” 

flammond looked at him, said, 
“No accusations have been made — 
as yet. That’s why Fm here today. 
You have reported no successes 
within the past six months, you 
know.” 

“Mr. Hammond, there have been 
many failures. Within the limited 
framework of the present stages of 
the project experiments, that is ex- 
actly what should be expected.” 
“Limited in what way?” 

“Limited to the lower, less com- 
plicated forms of animal life.” 
“That,” said Hammond mildly, 
“is a limitation you yourself have 
imposed on the project.”

Dr. Gloge agieed. '*1 rue. The 
conclusions I’ve been able to form 
at such lower levels have been in- 
valuable. And the fact that the 
results of the experiments have been 
almost invariably negative, in the 
sense that as a usual result the 
subject animals evolyed into non- 
viable forms, is completely unimpor- 
tant.” 

“As a usual result,” Hammond 
repeated. “Then not all of them died 
quickly?” 

Gloge bit his lip. That was not an 
admission he had intended to make 
at this initial stage in the discussion. 

He said, reluctantly, “In a respect- 
able percentage of the cases, the 
subject animals survived the first 
injection.” 

“And the second?” 

Gloge hesitated. But there was no 
turning back. “The survival percent- 
age drops very sharply at that 
point,” he said. “I don’t recall the 
exact figures.” 

“And the third?” 

H e was really being forced to 
make revelations. Dr. Gloge 
said, “To date, three animals have 
survived the third injection. All three 
were of the same species — Crypto- 
hranchus^ 

“The hellbender,” said Hammond. 
“Well! A large salamander . Now, 
the third injection, according to your 
theory, should advance an animal 
along the evolutionary line stimu- 
lated in it to a point which might be 
reached through half a million years 
of natural evolution. Would you say 
such a result was achieved in these 
three cases?” 

14 



Dr. Gloge said, “Since Crypto- 
branchus might be considered with 
some reason to be a species in which 
evolutionary development is at a 
practical standstill, I should say that 
much more was achieved.” 

“What were the observable 
changes?” 

Gloge had been bracing himself 
as he made one admission after 
another. He was striving to decide 
exactly when he could start resisting 
the interrogation. 

Nowl he thought. 

He said aloud, trying to appear 
frank, “Mr. Hammond, I’m begin- 
ning to realize that I was in error 
in not making more positive reports. 
I can’t believe that you are really 
interested in these superficial ac- 
counts. Why not let me summarize 
my observations for you?” 

Hammond’s gray eyes were clam 
and steady. “Go ahead,” he said in 
an even tone. 

Gloge outlined his conclusions, 
then. The interesting features were 
two-fold, probably equally impor- 
tant. 

One of these was that there re- 
mained in all life forms a wide 
evolutionary choice. For reasons that 
were not yet clear, the Omega serum 
stimulated one oi these potential de- 
velopments and no subsequent 
stimulation could alter the mutation- 
al direction. Most of these develop- 
ments led to extnetion. 

“The second feature,” said Gloge, 
“is that the chances for success in- 
crease as the life form becomes more 
highly evolved.” 

Hammond said, interested, “What 
you’re saying is that when you finally 

IF 




start working with the more active 
mammals and eventually monkeys, 
you expect more and better results?” 

“I have no doubt about it,” said 
Dr. Gloge, firmly. 

A secondary aspect — Gloge con- 
tinued — was that brain areas which 
controlled the inhibition of simple 
reflexes often seemed to be the 
source of new neural growth and of 
sensory extension. The serum appar- 
ently intensified these effort points, 
increasing their operational flexi- 
bility. What went wrong was that 
all too often such one-sided inhib- 
itory amplification ended in non- 
survival. 

However, in Cryptobranchus, the 
roof of the mouth developed small 
functional gills. The hide thickened 
into segmented, horny armor. Short, 
grooved fangs were acquired and 
connected to glands that produced 
a mild hematoxic venom. The eyes 
disappeared, but areas in the skin 
developed sight-level sensitivity to 
light. 

Gloge shrugged, finished: “There 
were other changes, but these would 
seem the most dramatic ones.” 

“They sound sufficiently dramat- 
ic,” said Hammond. “What happened 
to the two specimens which were 
not dissected?” 

Dr. Gloge realized that his diver- 
sion had not worked. “They were 
given the fourth injection, of 
course,” he said resignedly. 

iC'T^he one,” Hammond asked, 
A “which was to advance them 
to a point a million years along the 
evolutionary line tocy were foUow- 
ing — 

RESEARCH ALPHA 



“Or,” Dr. Gloge said, “to the 
peak-point of that evolutionary line. 
The equating of the four stages of 
the stimulation process to the pass- 
ing of specific periods of normal 
evolutionary development — ^twenty 
thousand years, fifty thousand, five 
hundred thousand, and one million 
years — is, of course, hypothetical 
and generalized. My calculations 
indicate that in many species of 
which we have knowledge in that 
area the two points might be ap- 
proximately the same.” 

Hammond nodded. “1 understand. 
Doctor. And what happened after 
your evolved Cryptobranchus re- 
ceived the fourth injection?” 

“I cannot give you a precise an- 
swer to that, Mr. Hammond. In 
appearance it was a very rapid 
breakdown of the entire structure. 
Within two hours, both specimens 
literally dissolved,” Gloge answered 
tensely. 

“In other words,” Hammond said, 
“Point Omega Stimulation directs 
Cryptobranchus and, in fact, every 
species to which it has been applied 
into one of the many blind alleys 
of evolution.” 

Dr. Gloge said curtly, “So far h 
has done that.” 

Hammond was silent, then: “One 
more point,” he said. “It’s been 
suggested that you might consider 
taking on a sufficiently qualified 
assistant in this work. Research 
Alpha probably could obtain Sir 
Hubert Roland for a project of such 
interest.” 

Dr. Gloge said coldly, “With all 
due respect for Sir Hubert Roland’s 
accomplishments, I would regard 

15 




him as a meddler here! If the at- 
tempt is made to force him on me, 
I shall resist it.” 

‘‘Well,” Hammond said easily, 
“let’s not make any unalterable 
decisions at the moment. As I men- 
tioned, this has been a completely 
informal discussion.” He glanced at 
his watch. “I’m afraid we’ll have to 
terminate it now. Would you have 
time to see me in my office one week 
from today at ten o’clock, Doctor? 
I wish to carry this matter a little 
further, and that will be my first 
free time.” 

Dr. Gloge had difficulty restrain- 
ing his feeling of triumph. Today 
was Wednesday. He had selected it 
as his starting time because he had 
wanted his subjects to be away from 
Iheir place of work over the week- 
end. 

Between now and Saturday, he 
oould undoubtedly accomplish the 
first two injections on the young 
couple. 

By the following Wednesday, 
the third, perhaps even the fourA 
riiot would have been administered 
and all strong reactions either taken 
care of or the experiment termi- 
nated. 

To cover up his elation, Gloge 
said in the tone of one making a 
concession, “As you wish, Mr. Ham- 
mond.” 

m 

D r. Henry Gloge was awake 
much of the night, vacillating 
between hopes and fears of what 
he would find when he went to 
check on the first results of Point 



Omega Stimulation in human beings. 
If they were obviously negative, ho 
would have only one choice. 

It could be called murder. 

Dr. Gloge approached that sub- 
ject in a detached, undisturbed frame 
of mind. He had several times in 
his work secretly carried on a more 
advanced experiment while, osten- 
sibly, following the step-by-step sci- 
entific method. Thus fortified by 
special knowledge, he had in the 
past been able to plan lower-step 
work with the sometimes intuitive 
insights gained from his unpublicized 
private investigation. 

The importance of the Omega 
project to him justified a similar 
expedient. Objectively considered, in 
the light of such a goal, the lives 
of the two young people he had 
chosen for the experiment were, of 
no value. Their destruction, if it 
became necessary, would be in the 
same category as the slaughter of 
other experimental subjects. 

With human beings there was, of 
course, an element of personal risk 
mvolved for himself. It was that 
realization that trouUed him, now 
that he had made the first injection. 
Time and again. Dr. Gloge awak- 
ened out of a nightmare-riddled 
half-sleep, to quail anew at the 
knowledge and to lie sweating with 
anxiety until he slid back into ex- 
hausted slumber. 

When four o’clock came, it was 
almost with relief that he arose, 
fortified himself with several tablets 
of a powerful stimulsmt, made a last 
check of his preparations, and set 
out across town toward the house 
where the Ellington girl had a room. 



16 



IF 




He drove in a black panel truck 
that he had bought and equipped 
for his experiment. 

He arrived at his destination 
about a quarter past five. It was a 
quiet residential street, a tree-lined 
avenue in one of the older sections 
of the city, approximately eight 
miles west of the Research Alpha 
complex. Two hundred yards from 
the house. Dr. Gloge pulled the 
small truck up to the curb on the 
opposite side of the street and 
shut off the motor. 

F or the past week, a miniature 
audio pickup-recorder, insert- 
ed under the bark of a sycamore tree 
across the street from the house, 
had been trained on Barbara Elling- 
ton’s second-floor room, its protrud- 
ing head cunningly painted to re- 
semble a rusty nail. Dr. Gloge now 
took the other part of the two-piece 
instrument from the dashboard com- 
partment of the truck, inserted the 
plug in his ear, and switched it on. 

After perhaps half a minute of 
twisting the tuning dial back and 
forth, he felt his face whiten. He 
had tested the instrument at night 
on two occasions during the past 
week. It was quite sensitive enough 
to pick up the sounds of breathing 
and even the heartbeat of anyone 
in the room; and so he knew with 
absolute certainty ^at Barbara El- 
lington’s room had no living occu- 
pant at this moment. 

Quickly, he attached the recording 
playback mechanism to the little 
device, turned it back one hour, and 
put the plug into his ear again. 
Almost at once, he relaxed. 



Barbara Ellington had been in 
that room, asleep, an hour ago 
breath even and undisturbed, heart 
beat strong and slow. Dr. Gloge had 
listened to similar recordings of too 
many experimental animals to have 
the slightest doubt. This subject had 
moved up successfully, unharmed, to 
the first stage of Point Omega 
Stimulation! 

The impact of his triumph after 
the ghastly fears of the night was 
very strong. Dr. Gloge needed sev- 
eral minutes to compose himself. 
Finally, he was able to move the 
recorder by ten-minute steps to a 
point where the Ellington girl obvi- 
ously was awake and moving about 
the room. He listened with absorbed 
fascination, feeling almost able to 
visualize from moment to moment 
exactly what she was doing. At one 
point, she stood still for some 
seconds and then uttered a low, 
warm laugh which sent thrills of 
delight through the listening scien- 
tist. Perhaps a minute later, he 
heard a door being closed. After 
that, there was only the empty, 
Kfeless silence which had startled 
him so badly. 

B arbara Ellington had awakened 
that Thursday morning with a 
thought she had never had before. 
It was: “Life doesn’t have to be 
serious!” 

She was contemplating this frivo- 
lous notion with the beginning of 
amazement when a second thought 
came which she had also never had 
in her entire previous existence. 
“What is this mad drive to enslave 
myself to a man?” 



RESEARCH ALPHA 



17 




The thought seemed natural and 
obviously true. It had no general 
rejection of men in it. She still — it 
seemed to her — loved Vince . but 
differently. 

Thought of Vince brought a smile. 
She had already noted in one of 
numerous, quick, darting glances 
around the room that it was nearly 
two hours before her usual rising 
time. The sun was peering through 
her bedroom window at that almost 
horizontal angle which, in the past, 
had seemed to her a horrifying 
threat that she would be robbed of 
precious sleep. 

Now, it struck her: “Why don’t I 
call Vince and we’ll go for a drive 
before I have to go to work?” 

She reached for the phone, then 
considered and drew back. Let the 
poor man sleep a little longer. 

She dressed swiftly, but with more 
than usual care. When she glanced 
at the mirror, it occurred to her 
that she was better looking than she 
had realized. 

. Very much better looking! she 
decided an instant later. Intrigued, 
for a moment amazed, she went up 
to the mirror, studied the face in it. 
Her face, familiar. But also the face 
of a radiant stranger. Another 
awareness came and the bright, 
glowing, blue mirror-eyes holding 
hers seemed to widen. 

“I feel twice as alive as I ever 
have before!” 

. Surprise . pleasure . and sud- 
denly: “Shouldn’t I wonder w/zy?” 

The mirror-face frowned slightly, 
then laughed at her. 

There had been a change, a won- 
derful one, and the change was not 



yet complete. There was a sense of 
shifting deep inside her, of flows of 
brightness along the edges of her 
mind. Curiosity had stirred, but it 
was light, not urgent or anxious. 
“When I want to know, I will know!” 
Barbara told herself . and, with 
that, the trace of curiosity was 
dismissed. 

“And now.” 

She glanced once more around the 
little room. For over a year, it had 
held her, contained her, sheltered 
her. But she didn’t Want shelter now. 
The room couldn’t hold her todayl 

She decided, smiling, “I’ll go and 
wake up Vince.” 

S he rang Vince’s doorbell five 
times before she heard him 
stirring inside. Then his voice called 
harshly, thickly, **Who is that?” 
Barbara laughed. “It’s me!” 
“Good God!” 

The lock clicked back and the 
door opened. Vince stood staring at 
her with bloodshot eyes. He’d pulled 
a robe on over his pajamas; his 
bony face was flushed and his red 
hair tangled. 

“What are you doing up at this 
hour?” he demanded as Barbara 
stepped past him into the apartm^t. 
"It’s half-past five!” 

“It’s a wonderful morning. I 
couldn’t stay in bed. I thought Fd 
get you to go for a drive with me 
before I went to work.” 

Vince pulled the door shut, 
blinked at her incredulously. “Go 
for drive!” he repeated. 

Barbara asked, “Aren’t you feeling 
well, Vince? You look almost as if 
you’re running a fever.” 



18 



IF 




Vince shook his head. don’t 
feel feverish, but I sure don’t feel 
well either. I don’t know what’s the 
matter. Come on and sit down. 
Want some coffee?” 

“Not especially. I’ll make some for 
you, if you like.” 

“Nah, don’t bother. I’m sort of 
nauseated right now.” Vince sat 
down on the couch of the little 
living room, fished cigarettes and 
matches from a pocket of his robe, 
lit a cigarette and grimaced. “That 
doesn’t taste too good either!” He 
scowled at Barbara. “Something 
pretty damn funny happened yester- 
day! And I’m not sure — ” 

He hesitated. 

“Not sure of what, Vince?” 

“That that isn’t why I’m feeling 
this way.” Vince paused again, 
shook his head, muttered, “Sounds 
crazy, I guess. You know that Dr. 
Gloge you worked for once?” 

It seemed to Barbara as if whole 
sections of her mind lit up in bril- 
liance at that instant. She heard 
Vince start Co tdl his story. But — 
except for J<^ Hammond’s inter- 
vention — k was something she 
already knew. 

Part of a much bigger story . 
She thought: Why, that impudent 
little mani What a ^d, wonderful, 
terrific thing to do! 

Excitement raced through her. 
The paper she had seen lying on 
Helen Wendell’s desk flashed into 
her mind, every word sharp and 
distinct — and not only the words! 

Now she understood. What they 
meant, what they implied, the pos- 
sibilities concealed behind them — 
for herself, for Vince. 



Another feeling awoke. Sharp 
wariness. 

There was danger somewhere 
here! JcAn Hammond . Helen . 
the hundreds of little impressions 
she’d received all suddenly flowed 
together into a picture clear but 
puzzling — of something supra-nor- 
mal, she decided, amazed. 

Who were they? What were they 
doing? In a dozen different ways, 
they didn’t really fit in an organi- 
zation like Research Alpha. But they 
had virtually complete control. 

Not that it mattered immediately. 
Yet she was certain of one thing. 
They were opposed to what Dr. 
Gloge was attempting through Point 
Omega Stimulation, would stop it if 
they could. 

“But they can’t!” she told herself. 
What Dr. Gloge had begun was 
right. She could fed the rightness 
of it like a song of triumph in every 
aspect of her being. She would have 
to make sure that it wasn’t stopped 
at this point. 

But she would need to be careful 
— and act quickly! It was incredibly 
bad luck that John Hammond had 
arrived almost while Dr. Gloge was 
giving Vince his first shot. 

“Do you think I dK>nld lepoft 
it?” Vince asked. 

“You’d look a Htde foofidi if k 
turned out that you were coming 
down with the flu, wouldn’t you?” 
Barbara said lightly. 

“Yeah.” He sounded hesitant. 

“What does it fed like, aside from 
the nausea?” 

Vince described his symptoms. 
Not unlike her own — and she’d had 
a few bad moments before she went 



RESEARCH ALP1HA

to sleep last night. Vince was going 
through an initial reaction period 
more prolonged and somewhat more 
severe than hers. 

She was aware of a fond impulse 
to reassure him. But she decided it 
would be unwise to tell him what 
she knew. Until he came out of his 
physical distress, such information 
might disturb him dangerously. 

She said urgently, ‘'Look, you 
don’t have to go to work until 
tonight. So the best thing for you 
is to get a few more hours of sleep. 
If you start feeling worse, and would 
like me to take you to a doctor, 
give me a call and I’ll come and get 
you. Otherwise, I’ll phone at ten.” 

Vince agreed immediately. “I’m 
really awfully groggy. That’s a big 
part of it. I’ll just stretch out on 
the couch instead of going back to 
bed.” 

When Barbara left a few minutes 
later, her thoughts quickly turned 
away from Vince. She began to con- 
sider various methods she might use 
to approach Dr. Gloge this very day. 

G loge reached the street where 
Vincent Strather lived and was 
looking for a parking place, when 
suddenly he saw Barbara Ellington 
emerge from the area of the apart- 
ment building and start across the 
street ahead of him. 

The girl was perhaps a hundred 
yards away. Dr. Gloge braked the 
panel truck hastily, pulled it in to 
the curb, rolled up behind another 
car parked there and stopped. He 
sat there, breathing hard at the 
narrow margin by which he had 
avoided being seen. 



Barbara had hesitated, glancing in 
the direction of the approaching 
truck, but now she was continuing 
across the street. Watching her 
swift, lithe stride, the proudly erect 
carriage of her body — comparing 
that picture with the frozen awk- 
wardness he had observed in all her 
movements the day before — Dr. 
Gloge felt his last doubts resolve. 

It was in the human species that 
Point Omega Stimulation would 
achieve its purpose. 

His only regret now was that he 
had not arrived even as much as ten 
minutes earlier. The girl obviously 
had come to see Strather, had been 
with him until now. If he had found 
them together examination on a 
comparison basis could have been 
made of them simultaneously. 

The thought did not in the least 
diminish the tingling excitement that 
filled him as he watched Barbara’s 
brown car pull out into the street 
and move away. He waited until her 
car was out of sight, then drove the 
truck down to the alley beside the 
apartment building and turned in to 
it. His intention was to give Strather 
a careful physical examination. 

A few minutes later. Dr. Gloge 
watched a pointer in the small in- 
strument he was holding drop to the 
zero mark on the dial. Pulling off the 
respirator clamped over his mouth 
and nose, he stood looking down at 
the body of Vincent Strather 
sprawled on the living room couch. 

Vincent Strather’s appearance was 
much less satisfactory than he had 
expected. Of course, the young man’s 
reddened face and bloodshot eyes 
■light be due to the paralyzing gas 



20 



IF 




Dr. Ologe had released into the 
apartment as he edged open the 
back door. But there were other 
signs of disturbance; tension, dis- 
tended blood vessels, skin discolora- 
tion. By comparison with Barbara 
Ellington’s vigor and high spirits, 
Strather looked drab and unimpres- 
sive. 

Nevertheless, he had survived the 
first shot. 

Gloge straightened, studied the 
motionless figure again, then went 
about the apartment quietly closing 
the window he had opened exactly 
one minute after releasing the in- 
stantly effective gas. The gas had 
dissipated now. When its effect on 
Strather wore off an hour or so 
from now, there would be notMng 
to tell the subject that anything had 
occurred here after Barbara King- 
ton had left. 

Tomorrow he woidd return and 
give Strather the second ^ot 

As he locked the back door be- 
hind him and walked over to the 
panel truck, Dr. Ologe decided that 
he would have to come back and 
check both his subjects that night. 

He felt extremely confident It 
seemed to him that before anyone 
found out that it had been started, 
the Point Omega Stimulation ex- 
periment on human beings would 
have run its course. 

IV 

H ammond heard the be^ sound 
as he was shaving in the bath- 
room of his living quarters whidi 
were located behind his office. He 
paused, then deliberately put down 



RESEARCH ALPHA 



his razor and activated a hidden 
microphone in the wall. 

“Yes, John?" Helen’s voice came. 

“Who came in?” 

“Why — only Barbara.” She sound- 
ed surprised. “What makes you ask?” 

“The life range indicator just now 
registered an over-six read.” 

“On BarbaraV* Helen sounded in- 
credulous. 

“On somebody,” said Hammond. 
“Better have Spe^ Servicing check 
the indicator out Nobody else came 
in?” 

“No.” 

“Well — che<* k.” He broke the 
connection and finished shaving. 

The buzzer sounded in Barbara’s 
office a little later — the signal 
that she was to report with her 
notebook to Hammond’s office. She 
went, curious, wondering if he would 
notice any change in her. Much 
more important was her own desire 
to take a closer look at this strange, 
powerful man who was her boss. 

She walked into Hammond’s of- 
fice and was about to sit in the 
dhair he motioned her to, when 
something in his manner warned her. 
Barbara made an apologetic gesture. 

“Oh, Mr. Hammond — excuse me 
a moment.” 

She hurried out of the office and 
down the hall to the washroom. The 
moment she was inside, ^e dosed 
her eyes and’ mentally re-lived her 
exact feelings at the instant she had 
sensed ^ — whatever it was. 

Not Hammond at all, she realized. 
It was the chair that had given 
forth some kind of energy flow. 
Eyes still closed, she strove to per- 
ceive what within herself had been 



affected. There seemed to be an 
exact spot in her brain that respond- 
ed each time she reviewed the mo- 
ment she had started to sit down. 

She couldn’t decide what the 
response was. But she thought: “I 
don’t have to let it be affected now 
that I know.” 

Relieved, she returned to Ham- 
mond’s office, seated herself in the 
chair and smiled at Hammond where 
he sat behind his great, gleaming, 
mahogany desk. 

“I’m sorry,” she said. “But I’m 
ready now.” 

D uring the half hour that fol- 
lowed, she took shorthand 
with a tiny portion of her mind, 
and with the rest fought off a steady, 
progressively more aware battle 
against the energy pressure that 
flowed up at her in rhythmic waves 
from the chair. 

She had by now decided it was 
a nerve center that reacted to hyp- 
notic suggestion, and so when Ham- 
mond said suddenly, “Close your 
eyes, Barbara!” she complied at 
once. 

“Raise your right hand!” he com- 
manded. 

Up came her right hand, with the 
pen in it. 

He told her to place it back in 
her lap; and then swiftly put her 
through several tests — which she 
recognized as being of a more im- 
portant kind. 

What interested her even more 
was that she could let the center 
respond and monitor the parts of 
the body that he named — without 
losing control. So that when he 



22 



IF 




commanded her hand to be numb 
and suddenly reached over and stuck 
a needle into it, she felt no sensa- 
tion; and so she did not react. 

Hammond seemed satisfied. After 
normalizing the feeling in her hand, 
he commanded: “In just a moment, 
Fm going to tell you to forget the 
tests we’ve just been doing, but you 
will remain completely imder my 
control and answer truthfully any 
questions I ask you. Understand?” 
“Yes, Mr. Hammond.” 

“Very well, forget everything 
we’ve done and said since I first 
asked you to close your eyes. When 
the memory has completely faded, 
open your eyes.” 

Barbara waited about ten sec- 
onds. She was thinking: “What 

roused his suspicions so quickly? 
And why would he care?” She sup- 
pressed an excited conviction that 
she was about to discover something 
of the secret life that went on in 
this office. She had never heard of 
a hypnotizing chair. 

She opened her eyes. 

She swayed — an act — then 
caught herself. “I beg your pardon, 
Mr. Hammond.” 

Hammond’s gray eyes regarded 
her with deceptive friendliness. “You 
seem to be having problems this 
morning, Barbara.” 

“1 really feel very well,” Barbara 
protested. 

“If there’s anything in your life 
that has changed recently,” he said 
quietly, “I want you to confide in 

^ if 

me. 

That was the beginning of an 
intensive questioning into her past 
history. Barbara answered fiwly. 



Apparently Hammond was finally 
convinced, for he presently politely 
thanked her for the conversation 
and sent her off to type the letters 
he had dictated. 

As she sat at her desk a few 
minutes later, Barbara glanced up 
through the glass and saw Helen 
Wendell walking along the hall to- 
ward Hanunohd’s office, disappear 
into it. 

H ammond greeted Helen: “All 
the time I talked to Barbara, 
the life range indicator showed 
eight-four, above the hypnotizable 
range. And she told me nothing.” 
“How is it registering on me?” 
Helen asked. 

He glanced down at his right to 
the instrument in an open desk 
drawer. 

“Your usual eleven-three.” 

“And you?” 

“My twelve point seven.” 
“Perhaps only the middle ranges 
are out of order,” Helen said, and 
added, “Special Servicing will make 
their check after day-time office 
hours. All right?” 

Hammond hesitated, thoi agreed 
that there seemed to be no reason 
for breaking the rules of caution by 
which they operated. 

During the lunch hour, Barbara 
experienced a brief return of the 
dizziness. But she was alert now to 
the possibilities. Instead of simply 
letting it happen, she tried to be 
aware of every nuance of the feel- 
ing. 

There was a — shifting — taking 
place inside her. 

She sensed a flow of energy par- 



RESEARCH ALPHA 



23 




tides from various points in her 
body to other points. A specific spot 
in her brain seemed to be monitor- 
ing the flow. 

When the pulsations ceased — as 
abruptly as they had started — she 
thought: “That was more change 
taking place. I grew in some way 
in that minute.” 

She sat very still there in the 
restaurant, striving to evaluate what 
had changed. But she couldn’t de- 
cide. 

Nonetheless, she was content. Her 
impulse had been to seek out Dr. 
Gloge some time during the day 
in the hope that he would be want- 
ing to give her a second injection 
That ended. Obviously, all the 
changes from the first shot had not 
yet taken place. 

She returned to Scientific Investi- 
gation and Liaison, 

The bell sound, as Barbara enter- 
ed, caused Hammond to glance at 
the indicator. He stared at it for a 
long moment, then buzzed Helen 
WendeU. 

“Barbara now reads nine point 
two!” he said softly. 

Helen came to the door of his 
office. “You mean her reading has 
gone up?” She smiled. “Well, that 
settles it. It is the instrument.” 

“What makes you say that?” Ham- 
mond seemed strangely unsure. 

“In all my experience,” Helen 
said, “I’ve never seen anyone change 
for the better. There’s the slow drop 
as they grow older, but — ” she 
stopped. 

The strong face was relaxing. Yet 
after a moment Hammond said, 
“Still — we never take chances, so 



I think I’ll keep her with me to- 
night. Do you mind?” 

“It’s a nuisance,” she said, “but aH 
right.” 

“Fll give her the conditioning that 
overwhelms twelve point 0 and 
higher. She’ll never know what hit 
her.” 

V 

I t was shortly after dark when 
Dr. Henry Gloge parked his 
black van near Barbara’s home. He 
promptly tuned in on the audio 
device attached to the tree and 
adjusted the volume for pickup. 

After thirty seconds of silence, he 
began to frown. “Not again!” he 
thought; then, wearily, “Well, maybe 
she’s over at her boy friend’s.” 

He started the motor and pres- 
ently drew up at the curb opposite 
Strather’s apartment. A quick check 
established that the lanky redhead 
was there — but alone. 

The young man was awake and 
in an angry state. As Gloge listened 
in, Vince savagely picked up the 
phone and dialed what must have 
been Barbara’s number, for present- 
ly he slammed the receiver down 
and muttered, “Doesn’t she know 
I’ve got to go to work tonight? 
Where can that girl be?” 

That, in rising alarm, was a ques- 
tion which Gloge asked himself as 
the evening wore on. He returned 
to the vicinity of Barbara’s boarding 
house. Until eleven P.M. the 
phone in her room rang periodi- 
cally, testifying to Vince’s concern. 

vi^en it had not rung for an 
hour, Gloge presumed that Strather 



24 



IF 




had gone off to night duty. It was 
not a fact that could be left to 
surmise. He drove back to Vince’s 
apartment No sounds came from 
it 

Gloge accordingly returned to the 
street where Barbara lived. 

He was tired now, so he rigged 
up an alarm system that would 
buzz hkn if Barbara entered her 
room; then, wearily, he crawled onto 
the cot ki the back of the van and 
quickly fell into a de^ deep. 

E arlier, as Barbara sat in her 
office a few minutes before 
closing time, she swayed and almost 
blacked out 

Greatly alarmed, she emerged 
from her office and reported the 
feeling to Helen Wendefl. She did 
not question the logic of seeking the 
help of Hammond’s blonde aide. 

The secretary was sympathetic, 
and promptly took her in to John 
Hammond. By this time Barbara 
had experienced several more brief 
blackouts. So she was grateful when 
Hammond unlocked the door be- 
hind his desk, led her through a 
luxurious living room and into what 
he called the ‘‘spare bedroom.” 
She undressed, slipped under the 
sheets and promptly went to sleep. 
Thus, subtly, she was captured. 

During the evening, Hammond 
and Helen Wendell took turns look- 
ing in on her. 

At midnight, the Special Servicing 
expert reported that the life range 
indicator was working properly and 
he himself checked the body of the 
sleeping girl. “I get nine two,” he 
said. “Who is she? New arrival?” 



The silence that greeted his re- 
mark abruptly startled him. “You 
mean she’s an Earther?” 

“At least,” said Helen WendeU 
after the man had departed, “there’s 
been no further change.” 

Hammond said, “Too bad she’s 
above the hypnodzable stage. Mere 
conditioning is actually a. sorry sub- 
stitute for what we need here — 
truth.” 

“What are you going to do?” 
Hammond did not make up his 
mind about that until after day- 
break. 

“Since nine two is no real threat 
to us,” he said then, “we merely 
return to routine and keep aware 
that maybe somebody is doing some- 
thing that we don’t know about 
Perhaps we might even use a little 
ESP on her occasionally.” 

“Here — at Alpha?” 

Hammond stared thoughtfully at 
his beautiful aide. Normally, he 
trusted her reactions in such matters. 

She must have sensed what he was 
thinking, for she said quickly, “The 
last time we used extended percep- 
tion, about 1800 Earthers tuned in 
on us. Of course, they thought of it 
merely as their imagination, but 
some of them compared notes. It 
was talked about for weeks, and 
some awfully important things were 
close to being revealed.” 

“We-1-1-1, okay, let’s be aware of 
her then.” 

“All right. On that basis I’ll wake 
her up.” 

A s soon as she was in her office, 
Barbara phoned Vince. There 
was no answer. Which was not sur-

prising. If he had worked the night 
shift, he would be dead to the world. 
She hung up and checked with the 
photo lab, and was much relieved 
when the night work list showed 
that Vince had signed in and out. 

As she sat at her desk that morn- 
ing, Barbara felt extremely grateful 
to Hammond and his secretary for 
having been so helpful to her. But 
she was also slightly guilty. She sus- 
pected that she had been affected 
again by the injection that Gloge had 
given her. 

It was disconcerting to have been 
so strongly affected. “But I feel all 
right now!” she thought as she typed 
away at the pile of work Helen 
Wendell had put in her basket. Yet 
her mind was astir with plans. At 
ten o’clock, Helen sent her out with 
the usual morning briefcase full of 
memos and reports. 

Elsewhere — 

Gloge had awakened shortly after 
seven. Still no Barbara. Baffled, he 
sliaved with his electric razor, drove 
lo a nearby business thoroughfare 
and ate breakfast. 

He next went back to the street 
wiiere Strather lived. A quick check 
established that the man was home. 
Gloge triggered his second charge 
of gas — and a few minutes later 
was in the apartment. 

The young .man had changed 
again to his pajamas, and he lay 
stretched , out once more on the 
settee in his living room. If anything, 
die angry expression on his face was 
more pronounced. 

Gloge, needle in hand, hesitated. 
He was not happy with this subject. 
Yet he realized that there was no 



turning back at this stage. Without 
further pause* holding the point 
almost against Strather’s body, he 
squeezed the trigger. 

There was no visible reaction. 

As he headed for his office at 
Research Alpha, Gloge’s thought 
was on the girl. Her absence was 
unfortunate. He had hoped to inject 
the serum into his two subjects at 
approximately the same time. Evi- 
dently that was not going to happen. 

VI 

A few minutes after he returned 
to his office. Dr. Gloge’s 
phone rang. His door was open, and 
he heard his secretary answer. The 
woman looked up over the receiver. 

“It’s for you. Doctor. That girl 
who worked here for a while — 
Barbara Ellington.” 

The shock that went through 
Gloge must have shown as disap- 
proval, for the woman said hastily, 
“Shall I tell her you’re not in?” 
Gloge quivered with uncertainty. 
“No.” He paused; then, “I’ll take the 
call in here.” 

When he heard the clear, bell-like 
voice of the girl. Dr. Gloge felt 
tensely ready for anything. 

“What is it, Barbara?” he asked. 
“I’m supposed to bring some pa- 
pers over to you,” her voice trilled 
in its alive, vital way. “Fm to give 
them to you only, so I wanted to 
make sure you would be there.” 

. Opportunity! 

It seemed to Gloge that he 
couldn’t have asked for a more 
favorable turn. His other subject 
would now come to his office where 



26 



IF 




he could fire the second infection 
into her and deal personaBy with 

any reaction. 

As it devdoped, there was no 
reaction that he coidd detect. She 
had turned away after delivering the 
papers to him, and that was when 
he fired the needle gun. It was a 
perfect shot. The girl neither jumped 
nor swung about; she simply kept 
going toward the door, opened k, 
and went through. 

Barbara did not return to Ham- 
mond’s office. She expected a strong 
physiological distuihance from the 
second injection, and she wanted to 
be in the privacy of her own room 
when it happened. It had cost her 
an effort not to react in front of 
doge. 

So she stayed in her bedroom, 
waited as long as ^e thought wise, 
and then phoned and told Helen 
Wendell that she was not well. 

Helen said sympathetically, “Wdi, 
I suppose it was to be expected after 
tfie bad night you had.** 

Barbara answered quickly, “I be- 
gan to have dizzy spells and nausea. 
I panicked and rushed home.” 
“You’re home now?” 

“Yes.” 

“I’ll tell Mr. Hammond.** 

Barbara hung up, unhappy with 
those final words. But there was no 
way to stop his learning about her 
condition. She had a feeling she was 
in danger of losing her job. And 
it was too soon. Later, after the 
experiment, it wouldn’t matter, she 
thought uneasily. 

Perhaps she had better take the 
“normal** precautions of an employ- 
ee. “After all,** she thought, “I prob- 



ably show symptoms.** She called her 
doctor and made an appointment for 
the foBowing day. Barbara replaced 
the receiver feeling a strange glee. 
“I ought to be in foul shape by 
tomorrow,** she thought, “from the 
second injection.** 

What Hammond did when he 
returned to his office late* that after- 
noon was to sit in thought for a 
while after Helen reported to him 
Barbara’s situation. 

Then: 

“It doesn’t add up. Helen. I should 
have asked you before. Have you 
examined her file?” 

The blonde young woman smiled 
gravely. “I can tell you everything 
that’s in it, right from the top of 
my head. After all, I security- 
checked her. What do you want to 
know?” 

“You mean there’s nothing?” 
“Nothing that I could find.” 
Hammond hesitated no longer. He 
was accustomed to trusting Helen 
Wendell. Abruptly he threw up his 
hands. “All right. She’s got the 
whole weekend to be sick in. Call 
me when she comes in to work 
again. Did that report arrive from 
New Brasilia?** 

“It was sent to Manila Center.** 
“Are you serious? Let me talk to 
Ramon. There must be a reason!** 
Quickly he was absorbed in his new 
tasks. 

B arbara slept. When she awak- 
ened her clock said twelve 
after seven. 

It was daylight, early morning. 
She found that out in a sensational 
fashion. She went outside and 



RESEARCH ALPHA 



27 




looked . without moving from the 
bed! 

There she was lying in her bed- 
room; and there she was out in the 
street. 

Simultaneou^y. 

Involuntarily, she held her breath. 
Slowly, the outside scene faded, and 
she was back in the bed, wholly 
indoors. 

With a gasp, she started breathing 
again. 

By cautious experimentation, she 
discovered that her perception ex- 
tended about a hundred yards. 

And that was all she learned. 
Something in her brain acted like 
an invisible eye stalk that could 
reach through walls and bring back 
visual images to the light-interpre- 
tation centers. The ability remained 
completely stable. 

Presently she became aware that 
a small black van was parked down 
the street and that Dr. Gloge was 
m it. She realized that he had an 
instrument with an earplug with 
which he seemed to be listening in 
on her. 

His face was intent, his small 
eyes narrowed. Something of the 
determination of this little, bald- 
headed scientist seeped through to 
her, and Barbara suddenly felt un- 
easy. She sensed remorselessness, an 
impersonal quality that was entirely 
different from her own light-hearted 
participation in his experiment. 

To Gloge — she realized suddenly 
— his subjects were like inanimate 
objects. 

In human terms the viciousness 
of it was infinite. 

As she continued to perceive him. 



Gloge shut off his instruments, 
started the motor of his car and 
drove off. 

Since 'Wnoe was again on the 
night shift, presumably Gloge was 
heading home. 

She phoned Vince’s apartment to 
make sure; when there was no an- 
swer, she called the photo lab. 

‘‘No, Strather didn’t come in last 
night,” the administrative assistant 
of that department told her. 

Barbara replaced the receiver un- 
happily, recalling that Vince had 
not responded well to the first shot. 
She suspected the biologist had given 
him his second shot also, and that 
he was not responding favorably to 
it either. 

She dressed and drove over to hk 
apartment. As she came near, she 
could see him inside, so when he 
showed no sign of replying to her 
ring, she let herself in with her 
key — and found him on the living 
room couch, tossing and turning. He 
looked feverish. She felt his fore- 
head; it was dry and hot to the 
touch. 

He stirred and opened his cyet, 
looked up with his sick brown eyes 
into her bright blue ones. She 
thought unhappily: “I’m so well and 
he’s so ill. What can be wrong?** 

Aloud, anxiously, she said, “Yon 
need a doctor, Vince. Wlurt's the 
name of that man who gave you a 
checkup last year?” 

‘T’ll be all right,” he mumbled. He 
sank back to sleep. 

Sitting there on the settee beside 
him, Barbara felt something in her 
lungs. Her instant, amazed thought 
was: “Gas!” But she was too slow. 



28 



IF 




S he must have blacked out in- 
stantly — because her next 
awareness was of lying on the floor, 
and of Gloge bending over her. 

The scientist was calm, efficient, 
seemed satisfied. Barbara caught 
his thought: “She’ll be all right.” 
She realized that he was stepping 
past her to Vince. “Hmmm!” Gloge 
seemed critical and unhappy. “Still 
not good. Let’s see if tranquilizer 
will help him.” 

He made the injection, then 
straightened, and there was a 
strange, hard thought in his mind: 
“By Monday night, it’ll be time for 
the third injection and I’ll have to 
decide what to do.” 

So clear was the thought that 
came from him, it was almost as if 
he spoke aloud. What his thought 
said was that he intended to kill 
them both, if either failed to develop 
as he desired. 

Shocked, Barbara held herself 
very still; and at that moment an 
entirely different growth process 
occurred in her. 

It began with a veritable flood 
of suppressed information suddenly 
rising to the surface of her mind. 

. About the reality of what 
people were ' like ... the dupes, the 
malingerers and the weaklings on 
the one hand, and, on the other, the 
angry and the distorted, the worldly 
wise and the cjmics. She recognized 
that there were well-meaning people 
in the world who were strong, but 
she was more aware of the destruc- 
tive at this instant ... by the mil- 
lion, the swindlers and betrayers — 
all self-justified, she saw now. But 
she realized also that they had mis- 



read their own bitter experiences. 
Because they were greedy and lusl^ 
ful and had lost their fear of punish- 
ment, earthly or unearthly; becauao 
they resented being thwarted m 
their slightest whim; because — 

A forgotten scene flashed into 
her mind from her own past, of a 
minor executive in her first job, who 
had fired her when she refused to 
come up to his apartment. 

All her life, she had been taught 
and she had tried not to be awaio 
of such things. But now, at samo 
level of neural computation, she 
permitted all that data to be calcu- 
lated into the main stream of her 
awareness. 

The process was still going on a 
few minutes later when Gloge de- 
parted as silently as he had come. 

After he had left, Barbara tried 
to get up and was surprised that she 
could not even open her eyes. The 
realization that her body was still 
unconscious presently enthralled her. 

What a marvelous ability! 

As time passed, it began to be 
disconcerting. She thought: “Fm 

really quite helpless.” It was early 
afternoon before she was finally 
able to move. She got up, subdued 
and thoughtful, warmed a can of 
soup for Vince and herself and 
forced him to drink it from a cup. 

Immediately after, he stretch^ 
out again on the couch and fefl 
asleep. Barbara left the apartment 
to keep her appointment with her 
own doctor. 

As she drove, she could feel a 
stirring inside her. More change? 
She decided it was. Perhaps there 
would be many such between now

and Monday. Yet her intuition wm 
diat she would not be able le 
dominate this situation with the 
changes from the first and second 
shots only. 

“Somehow,” she thought, “I’ve fot 
to get that ^ird shot” 

vn 

A t noon Monday, after he had 
dictated some letters to a girl 
from the steno pool, Hammond 
came out of his office. 

“What’s the word from Nine-two?" 
Helen looked up with her flashing 
smile. “Barbara?” 

“Yes.” 

“Her doctor called in this morning 
at her request. He said he saw her 
Saturday. She appears to have a 
mild temperature, is subject to dizEf 
spells, and a variety of unmention- 
able ailments like diarrhea. How- 
ever, there’s one unexpected things 
the doctor said — evidently his own 
comment. Interested?” 

“Of course.” 

“He said that in his opinion Bar- 
bara has had a major personafity 
diange since he last checked her 
about a year ago.” 

Hammond shook his head dowly. 
“Merely confirms our own observa- 
tion. Well, keep me in touch.” 

But about four o’clock, when the 
long distance screen was finally 
silent, he buzzed Helen Wendell. *1 
can’t get that girl out of my mind, 
it's premonition level stuff, so 1 
can’t ignore it. Phone Barbara.” 

She called to him a minute later: 
“Sorry, there’s no answer.” 

“Bring her file to me,” said Ham- 




mond. ‘‘I’ve got to assure myself I’m 
not missing something in this un- 
usual matter.” 

As he scanned the typed pages a 
few minutes later, he came pres- 
ently to the photograph of Vince 
Strather. He uttered an exclamation. 

“What is it?” Helen asked. 

He told her what had happened 
the previous week between Dr. 
Gloge and Vince Strather. 

He finished, “Of course, I didn’t 
connect Barbara with that young 
man. But this is his picture. Get 
Gloge’s file.” 

4 1 A pparently the change started 
when his sister died two 
months ago,” Helen Wendell said 
presently. “One of those sudden and 
dangerous shifts in personal moti- 
vation.” She added ruefully, “I 
should have watched him on that. 
The death of a near relative has of- 
ten proved important.” 

She was seated in die main room 
of Hammond’s living quarters at 
Research Alpha. The door to Ham- 
mond’s private office behind them 
was closed. Across the room, a large 
wall safe had been opened, reveal- 
ing a wide double row of thin, 
metal-bound files. Two of the files 
— Henry Gloge’s and Barbara El- 
lington’s — lay on the table before 
Helen. Hammond stood beside her. 

He said now, “What about that 
trip he made back east early in the 
month?” 

“He spent three days in his home 
town, purportedly to make arrange- 
ments to sell his sister’s and his 
property there. They had a house, 
complete with private laboratory. 



untenanted, on the grounds of an 
old farm. The perfect location for 
unsupervised experimentation. On 
primates? Not likely. They’re not 
easy to obtain secretly and, except 
for the smaller gibbons, they should 
make potentially quite dangerous 
subjects for Dr. Gloge’s project. So 
it must be humans he planned to 
work on.” 

Hammond nodded. 

There was an almost sick expres- 
sion on his face. 

The woman looked up at him. 
“You seem very anxious. Presum- 
ably, Barbara and Vince have now 
had two injections each. That wifl 
take them to 50,000 years from now 
on some level. It doesn’t seem des- 
perately serious to me.” 

The man smiled tautly. “Don't 
forget that we’re dealing with one 
of the seed races.” 

“Yes — but only 50,000 years so 
far.” 

He stared at her sympathetically, 
“You and I,” he said, “are still far 
down on the ladder. ^ it’s hard for 
us to conceive of the evolutionvy 
potential of the Genus homo gokc- 
ticus.^^ 

She laughed. “I’m content with my 
lowly lot — ” 

“Good conditioning,” he murnMir- 
ed. 

“ — but I’m willing to accept your 
analysis. What do you intend to do 
with Gloge?” 

Hammond straightened decisively. 
“This experiment on humans has to 
be stopped at once. Call Ames and 
have him put special security men 
at every exit. For the next hour, 
don’t let Gloge out of this building. 



RESEARCH ALPHA 



31 




And if Vince or Barbara try to 
enter the complex, tell him to hold 
them. When you’ve done that, start 
cancelling my appointments for the 
rest of the day and evening.” 

He disappeared into his bedroom, 
came out presently dressed for the 
street. 

Helen Wendell greeted him with: 
called Ames, and he says ‘Check!* 
But I also phoned Gloge’s office. He 
left about an hour ago, his secretary 
says.” 

Hammond said quickly, “Sound a 
standby alert. Tell Ames to throw 
a guard around the homes of both 
of those young people!” 

“You’re going where?” 

“First Barbara, then Vince. I only 
hope I’m in time.” 

A look must have come into 
Helen’s face, because he smiled 
tensely and said, “Your expression 
says I’m getting too involved.” 

The beautiful blonde woman 
smiled with understanding, said, 
“Every day on this planet thousands 
of people are murdered, hundreds of 
thousands are robbed and countless 
minor acts of violence occur. People 
are struck, choked, yelled at, de- 
graded, cheated — I could go on. 
If we ever opened ourselves to that, 
we’d shrivel away.” 

“I kind of like Barbara,” Ham- 
mond confessed. 

Helen was calm. “So do I. What 
do you think is happening?” 

“As I see it, Gloge gave them the 
first injection last Wednesday and 
the second on Friday. That means 
the third one should be given today. 
That I’ve got to stop.” 

He departed hastily. 



Vffl 

G loge had become nervous. A* 
Monday wore on, he kept 
thinking of his two specimens; and 
what bothered him was that he did 
not have them under observation on 
this last day. 

What a ridiculous situation, he 
told himself. The greatest experiment 
in human history — and no scientific 
person watching it through to a 
conclusion of the key second injec- 
tion. 

There was another feeling, also. 
Fear! 

He couldn’t help but remember 
the young man. It seemed to Gloge 
that he had seen too many animals 
^ow in their fashion the symptoms 
he had observed in Vince. Failure 
to respond well to the serum, the 
signs of internal malaise, the sick 
appearance, the struggle of the cells 
visibly reflecting defeat in the ef- 
fwts and chemistry at the surface 
of the skin. 

And there was — he had to admit 
it — a further anxiety. Many of the 
imsuccessful animal specimens had 
developed tough fight-back charac- 
teiktics. It would be wise to be 
prepared for emergencies of that 
nature. 

He thought grimly: “No use fool- 
ing myself. I’d better drop every- 
thing and take anoAer look at those 
two.” 

That was when he left his office. 
He took it for granted Aat Bar- 
bara was all right. So he drove to 
Vince’s apartment, and first checked 
with his audio pickups to make sure 
he was there and alone. 



32 



IF 




He detected at once movements; 
the sound of labored breadiing, an 
occasional squeak of the springs of 
the couch. These noises came 
screeching through the hyper-sensi- 
tive receiver, but Gloge had the vol- 
ume on them turned down so that 
they were not actually painful in his 
ears. 

Gloge’s spirits had already drop- 
ped even more, for the sounds he 
was hearing confirmed his fears. 

Suddenly, all the justified scienti- 
fic attitude that had motivated him 
until now came hard against the 
reality of the failure that was here. 

By his previous reasoning, he 
would now have to kill Vince. 

And that meant, of course, that 
he would also have to dispose of 
Barbara. 

His state of funk yielded after 
what must have been many minutes 
to a strictly scientific thou^t: Mere 
sounds were not enough data for so 
basic a decision, it seemed to him. 

He felt intense disappointment. 

Now, he must go and make his 
decision from an actual meeting 
with Vince. It would be improper 
to dispose of his two human subjects 
without a face to face interrogation. 

A s Gloge climbed out of his car 
and headed for the apartment 
building, Vince had a dream. 

He dreamed that the man — what 
was his name? — Gloge, with whom 
he had quarreled a few days before 
in the corridor at Research Alpha, 
was coming here to his apartment, 
with the intention of killing him. At 
some deep of his being, anger began. 
But he did not awaken. 



The dream — product of his own 
disturbed, strange evolutionary de- 
velopment — continued. 

From some vantage point, he 
watched Gloge approach his back 
door. He felt no surprise when the 
small, bald-headed man produced a 
key. Tense with fear, Vince watched 
as Gloge stealthily inserted the key 
into the lock, slowly turned it and 
quietly opened the door. 

At that point, Vince’s body was 
impelled by his extreme anxiety to 
defensive action. Millions of tiny, 
shining, cream-colored energy bun- 
dles were emitted by his nervous 
system. They resembled very short 
straight lines. And they passed 
through the wall that separated the 
living room from the kitchen, and 
they struck Gloge. 

Great masses of the energy units 
unerringly sought out nerve ends in 
Gloge’s body and darted in thdr 
scintillating fashion up to the man*s 
brain. 

The energy units were not 
the result of conscious analytical 
thought. They were brought into 
being solely by fright and carried 
pressor messages. They pushed at 
Gloge mentally, urging him to leave, 
to go back to where he had come 
from — 

Dr. Gloge came to his senses with 
a start. He was back in his van. Ha 
remembered running in precipitant 
flight. He had a vague recollection 
of complete panic. 

He sat now, trembling, breathing 
hard, trying to recover from the 
most dis^aceful act of fear that he 
had ever experienced in his whole 
life.

And he knew that he had to go 
back. 

Twice more, the sleeping Vince 
emitted enough energy bundles to 
compel Gloge to run. Each time the 
power available was less and Gloge 
retreated a shorter distance before 
stopping and forcing himself to go 
back again to the apartment. 

On Gloge’s fourth approach, the 
brain mechanism in Vince was able 
to manufacture only a small energy 
discharge. Gloge felt the fear rise 
in him, but he fought it — success- 
fully. 

He moved silently across the kitch- 
en floor toward the door of the 
living room. 

He still did not realize that the 
sleeping body and he had fought a 
battle — which he had now won. 

M oments later, Gloge looked 
down at the exhausted form of 
his male subject. The sleeping body 
had perspired excessively. It trem- 
bled and moaned, and, as Gloge 
watched, jerked fitfully. 

Unmistakably — Gloge decided 
— a failed experiment. 

He wasted no time. He had come 
prepared. He pulled a pair of hand- 
cuffs from his pocket, carefully 
slipped one over Vince’s farthest 
away arm and softly clicked it 
shut. He lifted the arm as carefully 
toward the other wrist and clicked 
that handcuff on also. 

Gloge next successfully tied 
Vince’s legs together, and then lash- 
ed together the hands and feet. 

The victim continued his restless, 
feverish sleep. 

Gloge brought out a gag. As he 



had anticipated, forcing it into the 
closed mouth was more disturbing. 
Under him, the body grew rigid. 
Wild eyes flicked open and glared 
up at him. 

In a single, convulsive effort 
Vince tried to bring up his arms 
and simultaneously struggled to get 
to his feet. 

But Gloge had done his prelimi- 
nary work well. The victim’s intense 
effort subsided. Dr. Gloge realized 
that his control of this situation was 
complete. He removed* the gag and 
said: “What I want to know is, how 
do you feel?” 

The half-crazy, rage-filled eyes 
snapped with the impulse to vio- 
lence. Vince cursed in a shrill voice. 
He kept this up for several minutes. 
Then he seemed to realize some- 
thing. 

“Y-you did something to me last 
week.” 

Gloge nodded. ‘T injected you 
twice with a serum designed to 
accelerate cellular evolution, and 
Fve come here to find out how you 
are.” 

His gray eyes were steady, his 
bald head gleamed in the reflection 
of the light he had turned on. His 
face was serious. “Why not teU me 
exactly how you feel?” he asked 
earnestly. 

This time Vince’s cursing subsided 
after about a minute. He lay, then, 
staring at his captor, and something 
about the pale, tense face of the 
scientist must have convinced him. 
“I feel — awful,” he said uneasily. 

“Exactly how?” Gloge persisted. 

Slowly, by dint of determined 
questioning, he drew from his reluc- 



34 



IP 




tant victim the fact that he felt 
weak, exhausted and numb. 

It was the fateful combination 

that had so often shown in the 
animals; and Gloge knew that it was 
decisive. 

Without another word, he bent 
down and started to force the gag 
into Vince’s mouth. Vince twisted, 
wiggled, turned his head, and sev- 
eral times tried to bite. But inex- 
orably Gloge pushed the gag all the 
way into the other’s mouth and 

knotted it firmly behind his head. 

He now went outside and drove 
the van into the driveway opposite 
the back door of Vince’s apartment. 
Wrapping the young man’s body in 
a blanket, he carried him boldly 
outside and into the van. 

A few minutes later he was 

heading for the home of one of his 
subordinates. The man was on loan 
to an eastern laboratory and his 
house and yard were unoccupied. 

If he had paused, if he had 

stopped moving, if he had even 
taken his foot off the accelerator, 
Gloge might have faltered in his 
grisly plan. But his only slowdown 
was when he finally brought the car 
to a stop at his destination. And 
that, in its meaning, was a 
continuation of the plan. 

Its final moments. 

L aboriously, he dragged the 
gagged, handcuffed and boimd 
Vince across the sidewalk, throu^ 
a gate, and over to the deep end 
of the swimming poc4. And stMl 
without pausing he shoved the tense 
body over the edge and mto the 
water. 



He straightened from his terrible 
act, stood there gasping for breath, 
exhausted, watching the trail of 
bubbles that roiled the dark surface. 
Abruptly terrified that he might be 
seen, he turned and staggered away. 

As he half-fell, half-crawled into 
his car, the first opposing thought 
came, as much a feeling of horror 
as an idea: “My God, what have I 
done?” 

But there was no opposing motion 
in that reaction. He did not go back. 
Instead, he sat there, bracing to the 
realization that a few feet away a 
man was still in process of drowning. 

When there was no longer any 
doubt; when the subject of his 
experiment was by all laws of life 
dead, Gloge sighed, and stirred. 
There was no turning back. One 
gone, one to go. 

Next — the girl! 

From a phone booth a few 
blocks away, Gloge dialed Barbara 
Ellington’s boarding house. The 
voice of an elderly woman answered 
and told him Barbara had gone out. 

The vcHce added, “She certainly 
is a popular giii today.” 

Gloge said uneasily, “How do you 
mean?” 

“Several men came by a little 
while ago and asked for her, but of 
course I had to tell them also that 
she wasn’t here.” 

A sharp fear struck through 
Gloge. “Did they give their names?” 
he asked. 

“A Mr. Hammond,” was the reply. 

Hammondl The chill of that 
froze Gloge. “Thank you,” he gulped, 
and hung up. 

He returned shakily to his car,

tom between two impulses. He had 
intended to return after dark to the 
pool, fish Vince’s body out of it, 
take off all the bindings and dispose 
of it. He had a strong feeling now 
that he should do that at once. On 
the other hand, he had a desperate 
conviction that he must return to 
bis office and remove the rest of 
the serum from the safe there. 

That last suddenly seemed the 
more important thing to do, and the 
safest at this hour. The sun had gone 
down below the western hills, but 
the sky was still bright blue. The 
dying day had too much light in it 
for the gruesome task of getting 
rid of a dead body. 

IX 

A t ten minutes past seven, Dr. 

Gloge unlocked the door that 
led directly from the corridor to his 
office in the biology section of 
Research Alpha. He went in, closed 
the door behind him, walked quickly 
around the big, bare desk in the 
center of the room, and stooped 
down to unlock the desk drawer 
where he kept a key to one of the 
safes. 

“Good evening. Dr. Gloge,” a 
woman’s voice said behind him. 

For an instant Dr. Gloge seemed 
unable to move. The words, the 
tone, sent an electrifying hope 
through him He could scarcely be- 
Heve his luck: that the second person 
he had to dispose of had come to 
where he could best deal with her. 

He straightened slowly, turned 
around. 

Barbara Ellington stood in the 



open door to the adjoining library, 
watching him, face serious and 
alert. 

At no tiine in ^at followed did 
Gloge have any other conscious 
awareness than that this was Barbara 
Ellington. 

But the very instant that he saw 
the girl, at some depth of his being 
neural readjustments took place. 
Millions of them. And from that 
instant, subconsciously, she was his 
dead sister. But she was not dead 
any more. She was reassuringly 
alive in the person of Barbara. 

A look passed between them. It 
was one of complete understanding. 
It occurred to Gloge that it was 
scientifically wrong to kill this suc- 
cessful experimental victim. He even 
had a feeling that she was on his 
side and would cooperate with him. 
He suppressed a fleeting impulse to 
pretend not to know why she was 
here. 

He said, matter-of-factly, “How 
did you get in?” 

“Through the specimen room.” 

“Did any of the night workers see 
you?” 

“No.” Barbara smiled slightly. 

Gloge was examining her with 
quick evaluative looks. He noted the 
way she stood, almost motionless 
but lightly and strongly balanced — 
a pose of contained, absolutely pre- 
pared energy. He saw in her eyes 
bright, quick intelligence. 

The thought came to him: Noth- 
ing quite like this was ever on Earth 
before! 

Barbara said suddenly, “You took 
a long chance on us, didn’t you?” 

The words that burst from Dr. 



36 



IF 




Gloge surprised him: “I had to do 
it.” 

“Yes, I know.” Again she spc^e 
matter-of-factly, moved forward in- 
to the room. Dr. Gloge felt a surge 
of alarm, a sharp, cold prickling of 
the skin. But she turned from him 
to the left, and he watched silently 
as she sat down in a chair against 
the wall and placed the brown 
purse she carried on the armrest of 
the chair. She spoke first. 

“You must give me the third in- 
jection of the serum immediately,” 
she told him. “Ill watch you do it. 
Then 111 take the instrument and a 
supply of the serum to Vince. 
He — ” 

She paused; blue eyes kindling 
with abrupt comprehension, as she 
studied Dr. Gloge’s expression. “So 
you’ve drowned him I” she said. She 
sat there, thoughtful, then: “He’s not 
dead. I sense him to be still alive. 
Now, what is the instrument you 
use? You must still have it with 
you.” 

“I do,” Dr. Gloge admitted hoarse- 
ly. “But,” he went on quickly, “it is 
advisable to wait till morning before 
administering the third shot. The 
chances of a further favorable de- 
velopment would be increased by 
doing it. And you must stay here! 
Nobody should see you as you are. 
There should be tests . you will 
tell me...” 

H e halted, realizing he was stam- 
mering. Barbara’s eyes hadn’t 
turned from his face. And in the 
same way that her knowledge of 
Vince’s fate had not disturbed him 
— somehow, he took it for granted 



that she realized and appreciated 
why and what he had done — so 
now her expression reassured him. 

She said quietly, “Dr. Gloge, there 
are several things you don’t under- 
stand. I know I can assimilate the 
serum. So give me the shot — and 
the serum — at once.” 

Barbara Ellington arose and 
started over toward him. She said 
nothing, and her face revealed no 
emotion, but his next awareness was 
of holding the jet gun out to her on 
his open palm as ^e came up. 
“There’s only one charge left.” 

She took the gun from his pdm 
without touching him, turned it over, 
studied it, laid it back in his hand. 
“Where is your supply of the serum?” 
Dr. Gloge nodded at the entrance 
to the library behind her. “The 
larger of the two safes in there.” 
Her head had turned m the di- 
rection he indicated. Now she re- 
mained stMl for a moment, gaze 
remote, lips parted, in an attitude 
of intent listening; then she looked 
back at him. 

“Give me the injection,” she told 
him. “Some men are coming.” 

Dr. Gloge lifted the gun, put the 
point against her riioukler, pulled 
the trigger. Barbara drew her breath 
in riiarply, took the gun from him, 
opened her purse, dropped the gun 
kiside and snapped the purse shut. 
Her eyes shifted to die office door. 
“Listen!” she said. 

After a moment. Dr. Gloge heard 
footsteps coming along the narrow 
corridor from the main laboratory. 
“Who is ky* he asked anxiously. 
“Hammond,” she said. “Three 
other men.”

Dr. Gloge made a stifled sound 
of despair. “We ve got to get away. 
He mustn’t find either of us here. 
Quick — through there.” He waved 
toward the library. 

Barbara shook her head. “This 
place is surrounded. All passages 
are guarded.” She frowned. “Ham- 
mond must think he has all the 
evidence he needs against you — but 
don’t help him in any way! Admit 
nothing! Let’s see what I can do 
with my — ” As she spoke she 
moved back to the chair on which 
she had been sitting. She settled into 
it, her face composed. “Maybe 1 can 
handle him,” she said confidently. 

The footsteps had reached the 
door. There came a knock. 

Gloge glanced at Barbara. His 
thoughts were whirling. She nodded, 
smiled. 

“Come in!” Dr. Gloge said harshly, 
too loudly. 

Hammond entered the room. 
“Why, Mr. Hammond!” Barbara ex- 
claimed. Her face was flushed, she 
looked embarrassed and confused. 

Hammond had stopped, as he 
caught sight of her. He sensed a 
mental probing. His brain put up a 
barrier, and the probing ceased. 

Their eyes met; and there was a 
flicker of consternation in hers. 
Hammond smiled ironically. Then he 
said in a steely voice: 

“Stay where you are, Barbara, 
ni talk to you later.” His voice went 
up. “Come on in, Ames!” he called. 

There was threat in his tone; and 
Dr. Gloge sent a quick, desperate, 
appealing glance at Barbara. She 
gave him an uncertain smile. The 
look of earnest, fumbling innocence 



with which she had greeted Ham- 
mond had left her face, leaving it 
resigned but alert. 

Hammond gave no sign of being 
aware of the change. 

“Ames,” he said to the first of the 
three men who came in through the 
library from the specimen room — 
Dr. Gloge recognized Wesley Ames, 
the chief of Research Alpha’s se- 
curity staff — “this is Barbara El- 
lington. Take charge of that hand- 
bag she’s holding. Allow no one to 
enter this office. Miss' Ellington is 
not to leave and is not to be per- 
mitted to touch any object in this 
room. She is to stay in that chair 
until 1 return with Dr. Gloge.” 
Wesley Ames nodded. “Under- 
stood, Mr. Hammond!” He glanced 
at his men, one of whom went to 
the office door and locked it while 
Ames turned to Barbara. She handed 
him her purse without comment 
“Doctor, come with me,” Ham- 
mond said curtly. 

D r. Gloge followed him into the 
library. Hammond closed the 
door behind them. 

“Where’s Vince?” he said in an 
inexorable voice. 

“Really, Mr. Hammond,” Gloge 
protested. “I don’t — ” 

Hammond stepped toward him 
abruptly. The movement seemed a 
threat. Dr. Gloge cringed, expecting 
to be manhandled. Instead, the 
bigger man firmly caught his arm 
and pressed a tiny metal object 
against his bare wrist. 

“Tell me where Vince is!” Ham- 
mond commanded. 

Gloge parted his lips to deny any 

IF 



38 




knowledge of Barbara’s boy friend. 
Instead, die confession of what he 
had done poured forth from him. 
As he realized what he was admit- 
ting, Gloge tried desperately to 
himself from talking. He had already 
divined that the metal touchidg hk 
skin was some kind of a hypnottc 
device, and so he tried to pull hk 
arm from Hammond’s grasp. 

It was a vain effort. 

**How long ago did you drown 
him?” Hammond asked. 

“About an hour ago,” said Dr. 
Gloge, hopelessly. 

At that instant shouts came from 
the adjoining office. The door was 
pulled open. Wesley Ames stood 
there, ashen-faced. 

“Af r. Hammond — she*s goneV* 

Hammond darted past him into 
the office. Dr. Gloge hiHried aft^, 
legs trembling. As he reached the 
door, Hammond already was coming 
back into the office w^ one of the 
security men from die hidl on the 
other side. Ames and the other men 
stood in the colter ol the office, 
k)okmg about with stupefied es^ires- 
sions. 

H ammond dosed the door, said 
to Aflits, “Quickly, nowl What 
happen^?” 

Ames threw his hands up in a 
gesture of furious frustration. 

“Mr. Hammond, I don’t know. 
We were watching her. She was 
diere in the chair . then she was 
not there, that’s all. He — ” he in- 
dicated one of the men — “was 
standing with his back to the door. 
When we saw she was gone, he was 
sitting on the floor next to the door! 



The door was open. We ran into the 
hall, but die wasn’t there. Then I 
call^ you.” 

“How long had you been watching 
hCT?” Hammond asked sharply. 

“How long?” Ames gave him a 
dazed look. “I had just taken my 
mother down the hall to the eleva- 
tor— ” 

He stopped, blinked. “Mr. Ham- 
mond, what am I saying? My moth- 
er’s been dead for eight years!” 

Hammond said softly, “Sk> that’s 
her little trick. She reached to that 
deep of the heart where the pure, 
unsullied dead are enshrined. And I 
thought she was only trying to read 
my mind!” 

He broke off, said in a dear, 
commanding voice: 

“Wake iq>, Ames! You three have 
been gone from the world for a 
couple of minutes. Don’t worry 
about how Miss Ellington did it 
Get her description to the exits. If 
riie’s seen approaching by a guard, 
tell him to keep her at a distance 
at gun point” 

As the three hurried from the 
office, he indicated a chair to Dr. 
Gloge. Gloge sat down, senses swim- 
ming, as Hammond took a pencil- 
shaped device from his pocket, 
pressed it and stood waiting. 

On the fifth floor of the Research 
Alpha complex, Helen Wendell 
picked up the small private phone 
at the side of her desk, said, “Go 
ahead, John.” 

“Switch all defense and trap 
screens on immediately!” Ham- 
mond’s voice told her. “Gloge’s 
drowned Strather — as an experi- 
mental failure. But the other one’s

awake and functioning. It’s hard to 
know what she’ll do next, but she 
may find it necessary to get to my 
office as a way of getting out of 
this building fast.” 

Helen pressed a button. “Not this 
way she won’t!” she said. “The 
•creens are on.” 

X 

O utside, it grew darker on that 
tense Monday night. 

At eight-eighteen, Helen Wendell 
again picked up the small phone 
purring at the side of her desk 
in the Research Alpha complex, 
glanced over at the closed office 
door, and said into the receiver, 
“Go ahead, John.” 

“I’m here at the pool,” John Ham- 
mond’s voice told her. “We’ve just 
fished his body out. Helen, the 
fellow is alive, ^me reflex prevent- 
ed any intake of water. But we’ll 
need an oxygen tent.” 

Helen’s left hand reached for 
another telephone. “You want the 
ambulance?” she asked, starting to 
dial. 

“Yes. You have the street number. 
Tell them to pull up at the side 
gate. We have to act swiftly.” 

“Police uniforms, also?” Helen 
asked. 

“Yes. But tell them to stay in the 
cab unless needed. We’re out of 
sight, behind a high fence. And it’s 
dark. I’ll come back with them. Has 
Barbara been apprehended?” 

“No,” Helen said. 

“I really didn’t expect she would 
be,” Hammond said. “I’ll question 
the guards when I get there.” 



B arbara had allowed Ames to es- 
cort her to the nearest elevator, 
while she continued to have hni 
think that she was his mother. 

Once in the elevator she pushed 
the up-button and came out present- 
ly on the roof. As she had already 
perceived, a helicopter was sched- 
uled to take off. And, though she 
was not an authorized passenger, 
the pilot took her along believing 
her to be his girl friend. Her sudden 
arrival seemed perfectly logical to 
him. 

A little later, he set her down 
on the roof of another building. And 
that, also, seemed the most natural 
act to him, her reason for going 
there obvious. 

He flew off and promptly forgot 
the episode. 

The hasty landing was an urgent 
necessity for Barbara. She could fed 
the new injection beginning to work. 
So in her scanning of the building* 
flitting by below, she perceived one 
in which the upper floors were un- 
occupied. 

“I’ll try to make it down to some 
office,” she thought. 

But she didn’t get beyond the top 
floor. She actually began to stagger 
as she went down the first steps 
from the roof. And there was no 
mistaking the out-of-control state 
of her body. To her left, a door 
opened into a warehouse-like loft. 
She weaved through it, closed it be- 
hind her, and bolted it. Then she 
half-lowered herself, half-fell to the 
floor. 

During that evening and night 
she never quite lost consciousness. 
Blackout was no longer possible for 



40 



IF 




her. But she could feel her body 
changing, changing, changing — 
The energy flows inside her took 
on a different meaning. They were 
separate from her. Presently they 
would be controllable again, but in 
another fashion entirely. 

Something of Barbara seemed to 
disappear with that awareness. 

“I’m still me!” the entity thought 
as it lay there on the floor. “Flesh, 
feeling, desire — ” 

But she had the distinct realiza- 
tion that “me” even in these early 
stages of the five hundred thousand 
year transformations was ME PLUS. 

Exactly how the self was becom- 
ing something more was not yet 
clear. 

The slow night dragged by. 

XI 

uesday. 

Shortly before noon, Helen 
Wendell came along the hallway 
that led from John Hammond’s 
quarters to the main office. Ham- 
mond was sitting at the far side of 
her desk. He glanced up at her as 
she approached. 

“How are the patients?” he asked. 
“Gloge is role-perfect,” Helen said. 
“I even allowed him to spend part 
of the morning talking to his assis- 
tants here. He’s already had two 
conversations by Telstar with Sir 
Hubert about his new task overseas. 
I’ve put him to sleep again, but he’s 
available. When did you come in?” 
“Just now. How’s Strather?” 

Helen tapped the recorder. “I 
checked with the MD machine on 
him twenty minutes ago,” she said. 



“It gave me its opinion in detail. I 
took it all down. Do you want tc 
hear it?” 

“Sum it up for me.” 

Helen pursed her lips; then: “The 
MD verifies that he didn’t swallow 
any water, that some newly devel- 
op^ brain mechanism shut off 
breathing and kept him in a state of 
suspended animation. Vince himself 
has no conscious memory, of the ex- 
perience, so it was evidently a sur- 
vival act of the lower brain. MD 
reports other developments are tak- 
ing place in Vince, regards them as 
freakish in nature. It’s too soon to 
tell whether or not he can survive 
a third injection. He*s under seda- 
tion.” 

Hammond looked dissatisfied. 
“All right,” he said after a moment. 
“What else do you have for me?” 

“A number of transmitter mes- 
sages,” Helen said. 

“About Gloge?” 

“Yes. New Brasilia and Manila 
agree with you that there are too 
many chances of a revealing slip-up 
if Dr. Gloge remains at Research 
Alpha any longer than is absolutely 
necessary.” 

“You said Gloge is role-perfect.” 

Helen nodded. “At the moment. 
But he is a highly recalcitrant sub- 
ject and naturally I can’t give him 
the kind of final conditioning he’d 
get at Paris center. That’s where 
they want him. The courier, Arnold, 
will take him aboard the Paris-jet 
at 5:10 tonight.” 

“No!” Hammond shook his head. 
“That’s too early! Gloge is our bait 
to catch Barbara. His experiments 
indicate that she won’t be able to 




RESEARCH ALPHA 



41 




function until some time this eve- 
ning. 1 calculate that somewhere 
around 9 o’clock will be a good time 
to let Gloge out from behind the 
defense screens.” 

Helen was silent a moment, then 
*aid, “There seems to be a general 
feeling, John, that you’re over-esti- 
mating the possibilities of any really 
dangerous evolutionary develop- 
ments in Barbara Ellington.” 
Hammond smiled tautly. “I’ve 
seen her. They haven’t. Mind you, 
for all I know, she may be dead or 
dying of the effects of the third shot 
by now. But if she’s capable of 
cominp., 1 think she'll come. She’ll 
want that fourth injection. She may 
start any time looking for the man 
who can produce the serum for her.” 

B y Tuesday, a new awareness 
had come to Barbara. 

She had developed brain mechan- 
isms that could do things with 
space — do them on an automatic 
level, without her conscious mind 
knowing what, or how. Fantastic 
things ... 

As she lay there, a new nerve 
eenter in her brain reached out and 
scanned a T<dume of space 500 light- 
years in diameter. It touched and 
eompreheBded douds of neutral hy- 
drogen and bright young 0-type 
stars, measured ^e swing of binaries, 
took a cdisus of comets and ice 
asteroids. Far out in the constella- 
tion of Ophiuchus a blue-white giant 
was going nova, and the new, strange 
linkage in Barbara’s mind observed 
its frantic heaving of spheres of 
radiant gas. A black dwarf emitted 
its last spray of infra-red light and 



sank into the radiationless pit of 
dead stars. 

Barbara’s mind encompassed it 
all, and reached farther . reached 
out effortlessly until it touched a 
specific Something . and withdrew. 

Brimming with ecstasy, Barbara 
cried out in her mind. What did I 
touch? 

She knew it had been something 
the brain mechanism was program- 
med to search for. But no conscious 
perception was involved. All she 
could be sure of was that the nerve 
center seemed satisfied, and ceased 
its scanning. 

But she sensed, in an intensely 
happy way, that it remained aware 
of What it had contacted. 

She was still savoring the joy a 
while later when she became aware 
that the shifting energy flows inside 
her had resumed. 

Gradually, then, she permitted her 
body and mind to sink into a recep- 
tive state. 

Midsummer heat built up over the 
city throughout the day. In the 
locked room on the vacant top floor 
of the multi-storied building three 
miles from Research Alpha, the heat 
grew stifling as the sun shifted 
overhead, began to beat in through 
closed, unshaded windows. Barbara, 
curled on her side on the dusty 
floor, did not move. Now and then 
^ uttered a moaning sound. Sweat 
ran from her for a long, long time, 
as the heat increased; then the skin 
of her face dried and turned dirty 
white. She made no more sounds. 
Even a close study would not have 
been able to prove that she still 
breathed.

By four o’clock, the sunblaze had 
^lifted past the windows, and the 
locked room lay in shadows. But it 
was another hour before the tem- 
perature in it gradually began to 
drop. About six, the curled figure 
moved for the first time. 

She straightened her legs slowly, 
dien, with a sudden, convulsive mo- 
tion, rolled over on her back, lay 
flat, arms flung loosely to the sides. 

The right half of her face was 
smeared grotesquely with thick dust 
caked in drying sweat. She breathed 
— lay quiet again. Several minutes 
later, her eyelids lifted. The eyes 
were a deep, brilliant blue, seemed 
oddly awake and alert, though they 
remained unfocused and did not 
riiift about the room. After a while, 
the lids slowly closed and remained 
closed. 

T he day darkened; the city’s 
lights awoke. The empty ware- 
house stood silent. More than an 
hour passed before the figure in the 
room on the top floor moved again. 

Tliis time, it was motion of a 
different order. She rose suddenly 
and quickly to her feet, went to the 
nearest window and stood looking 
cut through flie dirt-stained glass. 

The towering Research Alpha 
complex was a glow of white light 
to the west. Ihe watcher’s eyes 
turned toward it . 

A second of time went by. Then 
the mind that directed the eyes 
moved on an entirely new level 
extended perception. 

Night-shift activities in the re- 
search complex were not essentially 
different from those of the day; but 



there were fewer people around as 
the awareness that was Barbara 
drifted along familiar, lighted hall- 
ways, about corners, dropped sud- 
denly to a sublevel which contained 
the biology section. Here she flicked 
through the main laboratory and up 
a narrow corridor, pausing before 
the door to Dr. Gloge’s office. 

She moved through the door, 
paused in the dark and- silent office, 
then moved on into the library. She 
remained a minute or two above the 
big safe in a corner of the library. 
Then she knew. 

The safe was empty — and 
trapped. 

The awareness flicked out of the 
library, shifted to the fifth floor of 
the complex, drifted toward a great, 
black door showing the words: Sci- 
entific Liaison and Investigation. She 
stopped before it. 

Minutes passed as she slowly and 
carefully scanned the outer walls of 
John Hammond’s offices and living 
quarters. Here was something new 
. something that seemed very dan- 
gerous. Within the walls and doors, 
above the ceiling, below the flooring 
of this section, strange energies 
curled and crawled like twisting 
smoke. 

She could not pass through that 
barrier. 

But though she could not enter, 
her perceptions might, to some ex- 
tent. 

She must avoid, she decided, both 
the front entry door and the secret 
elevator which led directly to Ham- 
mond’s living quarters in the rear of 
the section. As the most obvious 
points for an intruder to consider. 



RESEARCH ALPHA 



43 




they were also the most formidably 
shielded. 

She shifted back along the hall 
to a point some twenty feet away 
from the massive black door, wcU 
back from the wall between her and 
the front office. She waited. Grad- 
ually a picture began to form . 

This was an unfamiliar room, the 
inner office of the section. There was 
no one in it, nothing of interest ex- 
cept a closed door across from the 
one n hich opened on the corridor. 

The inner office disappeared . 
and what came next was no picture, 
but a surge of savage, demanding 
hunger. 

Startled, shocked, already feeling 
the pull that in a moment would 
hurl her into the murderous barriers 
about the section, the searching 
awareness instantly broke the thread 
of visual perception, went inactive 
to allow herself to stabilize. 

Nevertheless, she now knew where 
the serum was — in a strongroom 
of Hammond’s quarters, heavily 
screened, seemingly inaccessible. 

Perception cautiously opened 
again. Another section of the living 
quarters appeared, hazy with hos- 
tile energies. The other — the male 
counterpart — was here. Alive. 

Here, but helpless. Here, but un- 
conscious, in a cage of dark force 
which permitted no more than bar- 
est identification by the searcher. 
She was very glad he had been 
rescued. 

M inutes later, she knew there was 
no one else in Hammond’s 
locked quarters. She withdrew visual 
perception from there, and let the 



picture of the main office develop. 
The blurred image of a woman — 
Helen Wendell — now seemed to ba 
speaking into an instrument connect- 
ed with the apparatus before her. 

A second band of perception 
opened, and voices became indis- 
tinctly audible. 

Ganin Arnold, the New Brasilia 
courier, was making his final call 
from the city jetport, nine miles 
south of the Research Alpha com- 
plex. 

“The doors are being secured,” ha 
said. He was speaking into a dis- 
guised microphone clamped over his 
mouth and nose, which had the 
appearance of the tranquilizing res- 
pirators many of the other jet pas- 
sengers were using now in the last 
moments before lift-off. Even to 
anyone within inches of him, hk 
voice would have remained com- 
pletely inaudible. In John Ham- 
mond’s office, it emerged clearly 
from the device on Helen Wendell’s 
desk. 

“Lift-off for the nonstop jet to 
Paris,” Arnold went on, ‘Svill follow 
— ” he glanced at the watch on his 
wrist — "in two minutes and thirty 
seconds. All passengers and every 
member of the crew have passed at 
least once through the measurement 
radius. Nothing which may have 
preceded or followed myself and our 
biologist aboard registers life energy 
levels significantly above the stan- 
dard Earther range — that is, of 
course, below six. 

“To sum it up, we definitely are 
not being accompanied to Park by 
any abnormally high human ev<^ 
tionary form. Dr. Gloge’s behavior 



44 



IF 





has been excellent. His tranquilizer 
has begun to take effect and he is 
showing signs of drowsiness. Un- 
doubtedly, he will sleep soundly 
throughout the trip.” 

Arnold paused, apparently waiting 
for comment. When there was none, 
he resumed, “As soon as the lift- 
field goes on, communication by 
this means, of course, will be im- 
possible. Since nothing is likely to 
go wrong 'from this moment on, I 
suggest, if it’s satisfactory to Mr. 
Hammond, that I end my report 
now.” 

Helen Wendell’s voice, seeming to 
speak from a point just within the 
left side of the courier’s skull, told 
him pleasantly, “Mr. Hammond pre- 
fers you to remain alert and avail- 
able for final instructions until the 
lift has begun.” 



xn 

I n the locked room on the top 
floor of the empty warehouse 
a few miles east of Research Alpha, 
the woman-shape standing at the 
window stirred suddenly out of the 
tranced immobility it had main- 
tained for the past minutes. The 
head lifted, gaze sweeping the softly 
glowing night-sky above the city. A 
hand moved, touching the thick 
windowpane probingly. The glass 
fell away like a big drop of melting 
ice. 

Dust swirled as cool air rushed 
in. 

Barbara waited, then moved clos- 
er to the opening. 

Her gaze swung to the west again, 
remained there. She listened. The 
myriad noises of the city were clear 



45 



RESEARCH ALPHA 



and distinct now. Overlying them 
was a thin fountain of sky-sound as, 
every thirty seconds — at this hour 
— a jet lifted vertically from the 
city port, cut in its engines and 
vanished up into the night with a 
whistling shriek. Her head shifted 
quickly briefly following the chang- 
ing pattern of the sound. Then it 
steadied. 

Her gaze rose slowly, slanting to 
the north, following a moving, dis- 
tant point in the night, eyes nar- 
rowed with intentness. 

On board the Paris jet which had 
left the city port a few minutes 
before, Dr. Henry doge now had a 
very curious experience. Drowsily, 
almost on the verge of sleep, he had 
been contemplating the pleasant 
significance of his assignment today 
to Sir Hubert Roland’s Paris Proj- 
ect. Suddenly, then, there was a 
sensation of coming partly awake. 

He gazed around him with a 
rising sense of alarm, looking first 
of all at his seat companion. 

The fellow was big, heavily built. 
He looked like a police detective, 
and Gloge knew that the man was 
his guard. The curious thing was 
that he was slumped back in the 
seat, head lolling forward, eyes 
closed . typical indications of a 
tranquilized stupor. 

Gloge thougiht; “Why is he 
asleep?” He had a strong conviction 
that it was he who should be un- 
conscious. There was a clear mem- 
ory of a device — an instrument 
totally unfamiliar to him — which 
the Wendell woman had used to 
implant a complete, compelling set 
of delusions in his mind. He had 



come willingly aboard the jet And 
he had, at the suggestion of his 
guard, inhaled enough tranquilizing 
gas from the seat respirator to have 
kept him somnolent until the jet 
touched down in Paris, 

Instead, minutes later, he httl 
come awake, the delusions of the 
day slipping from his mind! 

There must be an explanation 
for these apparently contradictory 
events. 

The thought ended. A feeling of 
blankness held him for a moment 
Then came a churning wave of 
terror. 

Somewhere a voice had said: 

“Yes, Dr. Gloge — there is an 
explanation for this!” 

Slowly, against his every inclina- 
tion but completely unable to with- 
stand the impulse, Dr. Gloge turned, 
looked back. There was someone in 
the seat behind him. 

For an instant, it seemed to be 
a complete stranger. Then the eyes 
opened. They fixed on him, glowing 
brilliant demon-blue, even in the 
muted light of the jet. 

The woman spoke, and it was the 
voice of Barbara Ellington. “We 
have a problem. Dr. Gloge. There 
seems to be a group of extra-ter- 
restrials on this planet, and I still do 
not have any clear idea of what they 
are doing here. That’s our immediate 
task — to find out.” 

44XTOU are whereT Helen Wen- 
A dell said sharply. 

Her hand flicked to the right, 
snapped a switch. A small view- 
screen on the right side of the desk 
m up. She said, “John — quick!** 



46 



IF 




In the inner office, John Ham- 
mond turned, saw the lit screen on 
the desk behind him. An instant 
later he was listening to the words 
tumbling hoarsely from the tele- 
phone speaker on his left. He said 
to Helen’s tense, pale profile in the 
screen to the right, “Where is he?” 
“At the Des Moines jetport! The 
Paris jet put down for emergency 
repairs. Now nobody seems to 
understand just what was wrong with 
it or what repairs are needed. But 
the passengers have been disem- 
barked, are to be transferred to 
another jet. Arnold’s in a state of 
confusion and shock. Listen to him!” 
“ — there was a woman with him,” 
the courier’s voice babbled. “At the 
time, I thought it was one of the 
passengers who had come off the 
jet with us. Now I’m not sure. But 
I simply stood there and watched 
Ae two of them walk out of the 
hall together. It never occurred to 
me to ask myself why this woman 
was with Gloge, or to stop them, 
or even to wonder where they were 
going . 

Hammond twisted a dial, dimming 
the voice. He spoke to Helen Wen- 
dell. “When did the jet come down?” 
“From what Arnold said first,” 
Helen told him, “it must have been 
over half an hour ago! As he puts 
k, it didn’t occur to him to call us 
about it until now.” 

"'Half an hourV' Hammond came 
to his feet. “Helen, drop everything 
you’re doing! I want an off-planet 
observer sitting in on this, preferably 
within minutes.” 

She gave him a startled look. 
“What are you expecting?” 

RESEARCH ALPHA 



“I don’t know what to expect.” 
She hesitated, began: “The War- 
dens ...” 

“Whatever can be done here,” 
Hammond said, “I can do myself. I 
don’t need anyone else for that. The 
defense screens on the northern side 
will go off for exactly forty seconds. 
Now move!” He snapped off. the 
screen, reached under the desk, 
threw over another switch. 

I n the main office, Helen Wen- 
dell stared at the blank screen 
for a moment. Then she jumped to 
her feet, ran across the room to the 
entry door, pulled it open and slip- 
ped out into the hall. The door 
swung shut behind her. 

Some moments later, John Ham- 
mond entered the room behind hit 
private office where Vincent Stra- 
ther lay enclosed by a trap screen, 
Hammond went to the wall, turned 
the trap controls there halfway to 
the off point. 

The screen faded into smoky 
near-invisibility, and he stared for a 
few seconds at the shape stretched 
out on the couch within it. He 
asked aloud, “There have been no 
further internal changes?” 

“None within the past two hours,” 
the MD machine’s voice said from 
the wall. 

“This form is viable?” 

“Yes.” 

“He would awaken if I released 
the screen?” 

“Yes. Immediately.” 

Hammond was silent a moment, 
then asked, “You have calculated 
the effects of a fourth injection of 
the serum?” 

4J 




“Yes,” the machine said from the 
wall. 

“In general, what are they?” 

“In general,” the machine said, 
“there would be pronounced changes 
end at an again greatly accelerated 
rate. The evolutionary trend remains 
the same, but would be very much 
advanced. The resultant form would 
stabilize within twenty minutes. It 
would again be a viable one.” 
Hammond turned the trap screen 
controls full over to the left. The 
screen darkened once more into a 
dense, concealing shroud. 

It was too soon to make the 
decision to give the fourth shot. 
Perhaps — mercifully — it could be 
avoided altogether. 

xm 

A t half past ten, the long-distance 
signal sounded from the tele- 
phone screen. Hammond glanced 
around from the portable control 
box on the desk, simultaneously 
pressed the answer button and the 
stud which would leave him unseen 
if the caller’s instrument was equip- 
ped with a viewscreen, and said, 
“Go ahead!” 

The screen remained dark, but 
somebody made a gasping sound of 
relief. “Mr. HammondV* It was a 
reedy, quavering voice, but it was 
distinctly the voice of Dr, Gloge. 

There were two sharp clicks from 
one of the instruments lying on the 
desk — a signal from Helen Wen- 
dell, in the observer boat standing 
off Earth, that she was recording 
llie conversation. 

“Where are you, Doctor?” 



“Mr. Hammond . something 
terrible . that creature . Bar- 
bara Ellington — ” 

“She took you off the jet, I know,” 
Hammond said. “Where arc yon 
now?” 

“My home — in Pennsylvania.” 
“She went there with you?” 

“Yes. There was nothing I could 
do.” 

“Of course not,” Hammond said. 
“She’s gone now?” 

“I don’t know where she is. I took 
the chance of phoning. Mr. Ham- 
mond, there was something I didn’t 
know, didn’t remember. But she 
knew. I . .” 

“You had some Omega serum in 
that farm laboratory?” Hammond 
asked. 

“I didn’t think of it as that,” Dr. 
Gloge’s voice told him. “It was an 
earlier experimental variant — one 
with impurities which produce a dan- 
gerously erratic reaction. I was un- 
der the impression I had destroyed 
my entire stock. But this being knew 
better! It brought me here, forced 
me to give it what was left of the 
serum. The quantity was small — ” 
“But enough for a standard fourth 
shot of the series?” Hammond said. 

“Yes, yes, it was sufficient for the 
fourth injection.” 

“And she has now taken it as an 
injection?” 

Dr. Gloge hesitated, then he said, 
“Yes. However there is reason to 
hope that instead of impelling the 
evolutionary process in what I now 
regard as a monstrous creature on 
to its next stage, the imperfect serum 
will result in its prompt destruction.” 
“Perhaps,” said Hammond. “But 



IF 




almost since you first launcbed Bar- 
bara Ellington into Ibis process, she 
appears to have been aware of what 
was possible to her. I can’t believe 
she’s made a mistake now.” 

“I . ” Dr. Gloge paused again, 
went on: “Mr. Hammond, I realize 
the enormity of what I’ve done. If, 
in any way, I can help avert the 
worst consequences, I shall cooper- 
ate to the fullest extent. I — ” 
There was a sharp click as the 
connection was broken, a pause, 
then Helen Wendell’s voice whisper- 
ed into Hammond’s ear, “Do you 
think Barbara let him make that 
call, then cut him off?” 

“Of course.” 

Helen made no further comment, 
simply waited; and presently, softly, 
Hammond continued: “I think she 
wants us to know that she’s coming 
here.” 

“I think she’s there now,” said 
Helen. “Good-by.” 

XIV 

J ohn Hammond glanced at the 
control box on the desk, and 
saw the flickering indicators. He also 
saw a wholly unexpected reaction: 
A condition of non-energy that ac- 
tually canceled energy. 

“Helen,” he said. “This woman has 
gone up somewhere out of our 
reach! What you’re seeing is energy 
trying to maintain itself against anti- 
energy. I received recognition drill- 
ing on such things, but I’ve never 
seen it before in an actual situation.” 
Helen Wendell, eyes fixed on a 
duplicate check screen in the distant 
observer boat, did not reply. A 

RESEARCH ALPHA 



shifting electronic storm was bla- 
zing through the check-screen indi- 
cators; it showed that the defensive 
forces enclosing Hammond’s office 
and living quarters were coming un- 
der a swiftly varying pattern of 
attack . presently that they were 
being tested alniost to the limit. 

It held that way for over a min- 
ute — every reading almost impos- 
sibility high, barely shifting. 

“John Hammond!” the desk top 
said softly to Hammond. 

He jerked slightly away, eyes 
flicking down to it. 

“John Hammond!” the chair whis- 
pered beside him . 

“John Hammond!” “John Ham- 
mond!” “John Hammond!” “John 
Hammond . .” 

His name sprang at him from 
every i>art of the office, in a swirling, 
encircling pattern. Because of his 
special supervisory position, Ham- 
mond knew the pattern and its dan- 
ger. It had never been considered 
probable, but nevertheless they had 
taken the possibility into account 
and so he had outside power avail- 
able to deal with this emergency. 

He looked hurriedly about on the 
desk for an instrument he had laid 
down among the others there. For 
an instant, he seemed unable to 
recognize it, and there was an icy 
touch of panic. Then he realized he 
already held it in his hand. He ran 
a knob up along its side with his 
thumb, locked it into place, laid the 
instrument back on the desk. 

A rasping came from it. Not only 
a sound, but a vibration, a rough, 
hard shuddering of the nerves. The 
voice-ghosts sank to a whisper, 

4t 




flowed from the room. Helen Wen- 
dell’s tiny, distant voice stabbed at 
Hammond’s ear like a needle: 

“The check screen! She’s leaving!** 
Hopefully. 

“You’re certain?** 

“Not really.” Alarm whipped at 
him through Helen’s voice. “What 
does your screen show?** 

“A subjective blur at the moment. 
It’s clearing.’* 

“What happened?” 

“I think she felt above us and so 
she took it for granted that she 
could walk all over us. Accordingly, 
she’s just had the surprise of her 
brief existence as a sub-galactic 
super-woman. She didn’t realize we 
represent the Great Ones.” 

“Is she damaged?” 

“Oh, I wouldn’t say that. She’s 
learned too much. But . details 
later.” Hammond blinked at the 
check screen, swimg around toward 
the door of the adjoining room, 
pulled it open. 

4 4 A dminister the final injection to 
-^the subject!” he said sharply 
into the room. “Acknowledge!” 

“The fourth and final injection of 
the Omega Stimulation series will be 
administered to the subject,” the 
machine replied. 

“Immediately!” 

“Immediately.” 

Helen’s voice reached Hammond 
again as he drew the door shut and 
came back to the desk. “At mo- 
ments,” she said, “the anti-energies 
were holding the ninety-six point of 
overload. Within four of the theore- 
tical limit. Did she get to you at the 
energy balance?” 



“Very nearly,” Hammond told her. 
**A very high-energy, pseudo-hypno 
trick that didn’t quite work. And 
she’ll be back. I still have some- 
thing she wants!” 

On his desk, the telephone screen 
blurred. When he turned it on, the 
voice of Dr. Gloge sounded in his 
ears. 

“We were cut off earlier, Mr. 
Hammond.” The biologist’s voice 
was strongly even and controlled. 

“What happened?” Hammond ask- 
ed warily. 

“Mr. Hammond, I have finally 
analyzed what evolution really is. 
The universe is a spectrum. It needs 
energies in motion at all levels. This 
is why those at the higher levels do 
not interfere directly with individual 
activities at the lower. But this is 
also why they are concerned when a 
race reaches the point where it can 
begin to manipulate large forces.** 
Hammond said steadily, “Barbara, 
if the purpose of this call is to find 
out if I’ll let you in, yes, I will.” 
A pause, then a click. Then there 
was a tiny, momentary flickering in 
one of the check screen indicators. 
Then, in a different section, another. 

“What’s happening?” Helen asked 
tautly. 

Hammond said, “She’s coming 
through the screens, with my per- 
mission.” 

“Do you think it’s a trick?” 

“In a way. For some reason, she 
hasn’t let herself reach that theore- 
tical, final million-year point on Dr. 
Gloge’s evolutionary scale. That may 
come a little later.” 

“And you’re actually letting her 
in, believing that?”

IF 




**0f course.** Helen dkl not answer 
him. 

A minute went past in silence. 
Hammond shifted so that he faced 
the door, moved a few stqps away 
from the control box and the desk, 
and stood waiting. 

A small light burned red in a 
corner of the check screen. Some- 
thing had come into the main office. 

The heavy sHence continued for 
some seconds. Then, on the hard 
flooring at the far end of the cor- 
ridor, Hammond heard footsteps. 

H e coiddn*t have said what he 
had been expecting . but 
certainly nothing so commonplace as 
the sound of a woman’s high-heeled 
shoes coming l»iskly toward the 
inner office. 

She appeared in the doorway, 
stopped there, loc^dng at him. Ham- 
mond said nothing. All outer indi- 
cations were diat this was the Bar- 
bara Ellington he had seen sitting 
in a chair in Dr. Gloge’s office the 
night befm. Nothing had changed 
either in her looks or in her clothing; 
even the brown purse she held in 
one hand seemed the same. Except 
for the air of radiant vitality, the 
alertness of her stance, the keen 
intelligence in her face, this also was, 
in fact, the awkward, overanxious, 
lean girl who had worked in the 
outer office for less than two weeks. 

And therefore, Hammond thought 
it was a phantom! Not a delusion; 
he was protected now against any 
attempt to tamper with his mind in 
that manner by barriers which would 
break only if he died. The shape 
standing in the door was real. The 



instruments recorded it. But it was 
a shape created for this meeting — 
not that of Barbara Ellington as she 
was at this hour. 

He was unsure of her intention in 
assuming it. Perhaps it was designed 
to throw him off guard. 

She came into the room, sniiling 
faintly, and glanced about. Ham- 
mond knew then that he hadn’t been 
mistaken. Something had come in 
with her . something oppressive, 
spine-tingling; a sense of heat, a 
sense of power. 

The curiously brilliant, blue eyes 
turned toward him; and the smile 
deepened. 

“I’m going to have to test why 
you’re still here,** she said carelessly. 
“So defend yourself!** 

There was no sound; but a cloud 
of white light filled the air between 
them, enveloping them; faded; 
flared silently; faded again. Both 
stood unmoving, each watching the 
other. Nothing in the office had 
changed. 

“Excellent!** the woman said. “The 
mystery behind you begins to reveal 
itself. I know the quality of your 
race now, John Hammond. Your 
science could never control the 
order of energies that are shielding 
you mentally and physically here! 

“There should be other indications 
then that in extreme necessity you 
are permitted to employ devices 
created by beings greater than your- 
self — devices which you do not 
yourself understand. And where 
would such devices be found at the 
moment? . Over there, I believe!** 

She turned toward the door of the 
adjoining room, took three steps,

and halted. A rose-glowing haze 
had appeared before the door and 
the surrounding sections of wall and 
flooring. 

“Yes,” she said. “That comes from 
the same source! And here — ” 

She turned, moved quickly toward 
the control box on the desk, checked 
again. A rose haze also enveloped 
the box now. 

“The three points you must con- 
sider vital here!” she said nodding. 
“Yourself, the being in that room 
and the controls of the section. You 
may safeguard these at the expense 
of revealing a secret you would 
otherwise least want to reveal. Now 
I think it is time for us to exchange 
information.” 

She came back to Hammond, 
stopped before him. 

“I discovered suddenly, John Ham- 
mond, that your kind are not native 
to Earth. You are superior to Earth’s 
humanity, but not sufficiently supe- 
rior to explain why you are here. 
You have an organization on this 
world. But it is a curious organiza- 
tion. It does not appear to serve the 
purposes of conqueror or exploiter 
. But let’s leave It at that. Don’t 
try to explain it. It doesn’t matter. 
You are to release the human male 
who was to have received the series 
of serum injections with me. You 
and the other members of your race 
stationed here will then remove 
yourselves promptly from this plan- 
et. We have no further use for you.” 

Hammond shook his head. 

iiTT^e might be forced off the 

Vy planet,” he said. “But that 
would make Earth an active danger 

12 



spot. The Great Galactics whom I 
represent do have servant races who 
carry out military assignments for 
them. It would not be to your ad- 
vantage if such a race were to 
occupy or quarantine Earth to make 
sure that the seedling race here 
continues to receive the necessary 
degree of supervision.” 

“John Hammond,” the woman- 
shape said, “whether the Great Ga- 
lactics send military servants to 
Earth or come here themselves is a 
matter that does not concern me in 
the least. It would be very unwise 
of them to do either. Within hours 
from now, the Omega serum will be 
available in limitless quantities. 
Within days, every man, woman, 
and child of Earth will have gone 
through the full evolutionary se- 
quence. Do you think Earth’s new 
humanity could still be supervised by 
any other race?” 

“The Omega serum will never be 
used again,” Hammond said. “I’ll 
show you why . .” 

Hammond turned, went to the 
control box on the desk. The rose 
haze faded before him, appeared 
behind him again. He threw a switch 
and the haze vanished. He turned 
away from the controls. “The energy 
fields that kept you out of that room 
are being shut off,” he said. “In a 
moment, the door will open. So see 
for yourself — the barriers are off.” 
Except for the blazing blue of the 
eyes, her face was a cold mask. 
Hammond thought she must already 
know what was there. But she turn- 
ed, went to the open door, and 
stood looking into the room. Ham- 
mond moved to the side of the desk 



IF 




where he could look past her . 

The energy trap enclosing the 
couch in the room had vanished. 
The dark thing on the couch was 
just sitting up. It shook its head 
dazedly, rolled over and came up on 
all fours. 

Its huge, dull-black eyes stared at 
them for an instant; then it straight- 
ened, rose to its full height . 

To a full height of twenty-two 
inches I It swayed imsteadily on the 
couoh — a hairy little figure with 
a wide-mouthed, huge-eyed gob- 
Mn head. 

Its eyes blinked in vague recogni- 
tion. The mouth opened. It cried in 
a thin, bleating voice: 

“Bar-ba-ral” 

XV 

T he woman wheeled, turning 
away. She did not look back 
at the grotesque little figure. a 
faint smile touched her lips as she 
gazed at Hammond. “All right,” she 
said, “there goes my last tie with 
earth. I accept what you said. I 
gather dKit the Omega serum is a 
unique development and that it 
hasn’t shown up elsewhere in the 
galaxy.” 

“That is not a Ht^al truth,” said 
Hammond. 

She nodded toward the ac^oining 
room. “Then perhaps you can tdl 
me what went wrong.” 

Hammond told her Gloge’s two- 
fold theory: that at this stage of 
man’s evolution many possibilities 
remained for evolvement, and that 
appsuently the serum stimulated one 
of these and thereafter was bound 



by natural law to follow that line 
of development. 

As he talked, he waif watching 

her, and he was thinking: *This prob- 
lem isn’t resolved. How are we 
going to deal with herV* 

He sensed an almost incredible 

strength, an actual, palpable force. 
It poured from her in a steady 

stream of power. 

He continued tensely: “The Great 
Galaotics, when planting their seed 
on a new planet, have never inter- 
fered with the basic characteristics 
of the various races that live there. 
They interject selected bundles of 
their own genes by grafting into 

thousands of men and women on 
every continent. As the generaticms 
go by, these bundles intermix by 
chance with those that arc native to 
the people of the planet. Apparently, 
the Omega serum stimulates one of 
these mixtures and carries it for- 
ward to whatever it b capable of, 
which, because of the singularity 
factor, usually leads to a dead end.” 

“The singularity factor — ?” Her 
words were a question. 

Men, Hammond explained, were 
born of the union of a man and a 
woman. No one person carried more 
than a portion of mankind’s genes. 
As time passed, the interaodon and 
mterrelation of ril the genes oc- 
curred; the race progressed because 
bfllions of chance mteimixings of 
different bundles took place. 

In Vince, one such bundle had 
been stirred, been whipped up to its 
cdtunate point by repeated Omega 
Stimulation — but evidently that 
particular bundle had strictly lim- 
ited possibilities, as would always be 



RESEARCH AL^HA 



53 




the case when a single person was 
bred, so to speak, with himself . 
the singularity factor. 

And that was what had happened 
to Vince and herself. They were 
products of the most fantastic in- 
breeding ever attempted — life sur- 
viving through one line, a kind of 
incest carried to some ultimate 
sterility, fantastic, interesting, freak- 
ish. 

ii'VT^ou are wrong,” said the wom- 
I an-shape softly. “I am not 
a freak. So what has happened here 
is even more improbable than I have 
realized. In myself, it was the ga- 
lactic seedling bundle of genes that 
was stimulated. Now, I understand 
what it was I contacted out in space. 
One of them. And he let me. He 
understood instantly.” 

She added, ''One more question, 
John Hammond. Omega is an un- 
usual term. What does it mean?” 
"... When man becomes one with 
the ultimate, that is Point Omega.” 
It seemed to Hammond that, even 
as he finished speaking, she was 
growing remote, withdrawing from 
him. Or was it that it was he who 
was withdrawing? Not only from 
her but from everything — drifting 
away, not in any spatial sense, but, 
HI some curious fashion, away from 
the reality of the entire universe? 
The brief thought came that this 
Aould be an alarming and disturb- 
ing experience. Then the thought 
itself was forgotten. 

"There is something occurring,” 
her voice was telling him. “In the 
small thing behind the door, the 
Omega evolutionary process is com- 



pleted, in its fashion. In me, it is 
not completed — not quite. 

“But it is being completed 
now . 

H e was nowhere and nothing. 

New word-impressions, new 
thought impressions came suddenly 
and swept through him like the 
patter of rain. 

The impressions took form. It was 
later in time. He seemed to be 
standing in the small room next to 
his office, looking down at the 
lanky, redheaded young man sitting 
groggily on the edge of the couch 
holding his head. 

“Coming out of it, Vince?” 
Hammond asked. 

Vincent Strather glanced uncer- 
tainly up at him, ran his hand over 
the jagged rent in the sleeve of his 
jacket. 

“I guess so, Mr. Hammond,” he 
muttered. “I . what happened?” 
“You went for a drive tonight,” 
Hammond told him, “with a girl 
named Barbara Ellington. You’d 
both been drinking. She was driving 
. driving too fast. The car went 
off a highway embankment, turned 
over several times. Witnesses drag- 
ged you to safety minutes before the 
car burst into flames. The girl was 
dead. They didn’t attempt to save 
her body. When the police informed 
me of the accident, I had you 
brought here to Research Alpha.” 
As he spoke, he had the stunning 
realization that everything he was 
saying was true. The accident had 
happened late that evening, in ex- 
actly that manner. 

“Well ...” Vince began. He broke

oft, sighed, shook his head. 

Fa was an odd gbl. A wfld one! I 
was pretty fond of her oooe, Mr. 
Hanunond. Lately, I’ve been trying 
to break off with her.” 

Hammond received the ki^>re8- 
sion that much more had happened. 
Automatically, he looked back 
through the open door as the private 
telephone in the inner office sig- 
naled. “Excuse me,” he said to Vince. 

As he flicked on the instrument, 
Helen Wendell’s face appeared on 
the phone screen. She gave him a 
brief smile, asked, “How is Strath- 
er?” 

Hammond didn’t reply at once. 
He looked at her, feeling cold, eerie 
crawlings over his scalp. Helen was 
seated at her desk in the outer 
office. She was not in a ^aceboat 
standing off die planet. 

He heard himself say, “He’s all 
right. There is veiry little emotional 
shock . How about you?” 

'T’m disturbed by Barbara’s 
death,” Hden admitted. “But now 1 
have Dr. Gioge on the phone. He’s 
qmte anxious to talk to you.” 
Hammcmd said, “All right. Put 
him on.” 

“hfr. Hammond,” Dr. Gloge’s 
voice said a moment later, *^this is 
in connectidn with the Point Omega 
Stimulation project. I’ve been going 
over all my notes and conclusions 
on these experiments, and I’m con- 
vinced that once you understand the 
extraordinary dangers which might 
result if the details of my experi- 
ments became known, you will agree 



dutt the project should be closed out 
and any records referring to it de- 
stroyed at once.” 

After switching off the phone, he 
remained for a while at the desk. 

S o that part of the problem also 
had been solved! The last 
traces of the Omega scrum were 
being wiped out, woidd.soon linger 
only in his nxtnd. 

And for how long there? Perhaps 
no more dian two or three hours, 
John Hammond dcdkled. The mem- 
ory pictures were paling; he had a 
feeling that sections of tt^m already 
had vanished. And there was an odd, 
trembling uncertainty about what 
was left . thin, colored mind-oan- 
vas being tugged by a wind whkii 
presently would carry it off — 

He had no objections, Hanunood 
told himsdf. He had seen one of 
the Great Ones, and k was not a 
memory that it was good for a 
lesser being to have. 

Somehow, it hurt to be so much 
less. 

He must have slept For he awoke 
suddenly. He f^ vaguely bewfl- 
dered, for no reason that he could 
imagine. 

Helen came in, smiling. “Don’t 
you think it’s time we closed up for 
the night. You’re working too long 
hours again.” 

“You’re right,” Hammond nodded. 
He got iq> and went into the room 
next to the office to tell Vincent 
Strather he was free to go home.

THE 

LAST 

EARTHMAN 

E gon lashed the tiller but let the 
little atomic jet go on driving 
the heavy dugout slowly toward the 
morning sun. He stood up, breathing 
in deeply, feeling the muscles ripple 
under his drying deerhide clout. 

The wind was rich with sea tang 
and the savory smell of the fish that 
Cala was frying over a brazier. His 
mouth was already watering as he 
went forward to take a plate from 
her. 

In the bow, old Herndon was 
nibbling with more relish than he 
had shown for months. The mark of 
approaching death was heavy on the 
emaciated face of the last earthman, 
but it was relaxed now, as if the 
pain from the malignancy had fi- 
nally ceased. He made room for 
Egon beside him, shredding the fish 
with a willow fork. 

“The seas are fertile again, like 
the land. Only we — ” He sighed, 



by LESTER del REY 



He was the last Earthman of 
all — even though he came 
from the farthest of starsl 



then made a tired shrug. “Could any 
world be as beautiful or bountiful 
as this mother planet, Egon?” 

“No, Herndon. Certainly not 
bountiful.” 

But it was Egon’s turn to sigh as 
he remembered the red winds over 
the plains of Dale and the forests 
beyond that had gleamed pale in 
the double moonlight. And there 
were the roofed cities filled with 
people who had gone a thousand 
years beyond the final culture of the 
Earth. Yet his words had been true; 
there was no bounty to Dale or the 
other settled planets. The seeds men 
had carried with them had all died 
before means could be found to 
make them adapt. The native 
growths were poisonous or foul. 
Food had to be synthesized there 
from the raw elements. 

It was almost twenty years since 
Egon had climbed out of the wreck- 



56 





age of lib Mb ptanet-pfospecdfig 
flihip after tiie exf^osion of his motor 
had forced him to land here. And 
even now, his night dreams were 
filled with the people and cities of 
Dale and the synthetic feasts at his 
mother’s table. 

H erndon had stopped toying whh 
his food and sat watching the 
faint wake where the little tender 
bobbed along on a line behind them. 
“And you say they’ve forgotten 
earth out there, Egon? They’ve mis- 
laid the world that bore them?” 
“There’s a vague legend of a 
mother world, but we’re taught it 
was destroyed completely,” Egon 
told him for the hundreddi time. “I 
suppose the location was forgotten 
during the first centuries of taming 
the new planets.” 

The old man swung about to face 
forward where he could sweep his 
eyes over die deserted sea. He nod- 
ded sadly to himself. “Yes, they must 
have forgotten. If they remembered 
only a Mtde of this, they’d be back.” 
Egon went aft to the tiller while 
the guUs swooped down and fought 
over what Gala scraped frcMn the 
plates. The atomic jet purred on. It 
was one of die few things he had 
been able to make from the salvage 
of Ms wrecked ^p. The ^ore was 
a smudge behkid them and ahead he 
thought he could just see the ruined 
Ember Stake projecting from the 
sea that had buri^ it so long ago. 

Ahead, Herndon was telling bits 
of the past to the ever-silent Gala, 
and Egon filled it in from all the 
times he had heard the tale. 

The stories he’d learned as a cMld 



were at least partly true. A thousand 
years before, a key discovery made 
fastcr-than-light travel to the stars 
simpler than rocket flight to the 
moon and also showed a simple way 
to convert mass dkectly to energy. 
A million colonists went out to the 
stars within a decade, and the Great 
Age began. 

It ended. An unthinkable global 
war broke out, powered by material 
energy. Its violence was enough to 
change the climate permanently, 
until now the polar ice was gone 
and the former coast ]mc lay more 
than three hundred feet below sea 
level. 

Despite the legends of Dale, Earth 
survived and most of its life went 
on. Only man faied. Somehow, tens 
of thousands survived and were 
gathered together to start anew. But 
the old fccimdity Ind been destroyed 
by some mutatioa that revealed 
itself slowiy as too few viable chil- 
dren were bom. 

When Egon landed, only nine 
adults and a chfld named Gala were 
left to find him. Now there was only 
Gala. 

The sun rose steadily as the dug- 
out drove on. Ahead of him, Egon 
could see clearly the wreck of Em- 
ber Stake and the projections of 
other buddings tfaaf had once tow- 
ered Mgh over a dty called New 
York. Hie saw Gala open her mouth 
silently now as if to intone old 
chants. She began to genuflect as 
they drew nearer. 

She was doing the tm<htional rev- 
erence to the Guardian, without 
seeming to care that old Herndon 
beside her was the Bving man her 



THE LAST EARTHMAN 







people had worshipped so long. He 
was the Cold Sleeper provided by 
the scientists after the holocaust, 
meant to revive from his suspended 
animation high in Ember Stake and 
bring mankind back to its ancient 
glories. He was the man who slept 
for a thousand years — until Egon 
accompanied the annual pilgrimage 
and found the faulty mechanism that 
had failed and repaired it. Now, 
after nineteen years of futility, he 
was going back to his ancient resting 
place only to die. 

He was the last earthman, sitting 
beside a sterile girl. 

E gon shut off the jet and let the 
dugout drift to a stop as the 
ancient pile of ruin reared high 
above him. He could not trust the 
boat too close where jagged metal 
girders might lie below the surface. 
Then he sat for a moment staring 
at the tip of the building, trying to 
picture it as it had been described. 

Earth had been proud once, he 
thought. Men had never built like 
this elsewhere. Even when lower 
gravity might have made it easier. 

He pulled the little tender up and 
turned to help Herndon as the old 
man moved back to the stern. But 
the earthman shook his head, mo- 
tioning to Cala, whose eyes were 
burning eagerly. 

“Let her go first,” he said. “Now 
that we’re here. I’m in no hurry. 
And my presence would only make 
mockery of her ritual.” 

Egon nodded. “Go ahead, Cala.” 
She was over the side of the dug- 
out at once, carrying her little 
bundle of tribute. Then she began 



paddling toward the entnmce hole 
in a slow, ancient rhythm. She stop- 
ped from time to time to make 
obeisance and mouth silent chants. 
It seemed to take her forever to 
cover the first hundred feet. 

There was a fond but wry smile 
on the old man’s pale face as he 
watched her. “Maybe I’m no better, 
Egon. But sentimentality grows as 
the hours shorten. I’ve come back 
to worship the past in my own way 
and die among my relics.” 

“I understand,” Egon' told him. 
But there would be no friend to 
ferry him back to the ashes of his 
fathers and the altars of his gods 
on Dale when his time came. There 
was no star-spanning dugout ready 
for him. 

He shook off his thoughts and 
went forward for his fish spear. By 
the time the girl returned, they 
would all be hungry again. He 
checked the wire wrapping of the tip 
and the well-greased shaft automati- 
cally, then leaped lightly overboard. 

Swimming had been a horror to 
him at first, a thing unknowable on 
dry Dale. But now he caught his 
breath without thinking and went 
downward into the clear green 
depths, driving himself with easy, 
powerful strokes of his legs. The 
water slid over him, resisting him 
and buoying him as free fall could 
never do. He turned and rose, caught 
his breath, and dropped again. It 
was only after several minutes that 
he bothered to look for prey. 

The waters were rich. He found 
his choice almost at once. A moment 
later he was over the rail with his 
prize. 



58 



IF 




He saw the thing before Herndon’s 
scream registered on his ears. It was 
high above the Ember Stake, slanting 
majestically through the air with a 
metallic glint in the sunlight. 

A spaceship for colonists, here on 
Earth! 

T he dugout suddenly lurched into 
motion toward the tower, al- 
most throwing Egon overboard. He 
twisted, to see Herndon pounding at 
the controls and screaming protests. 
But the old man wasn’t looking at 
the ship. He was staring at the tip 
of the ruined tower. 

There was movement there. Some- 
thing thin and sharp slid from a 
hidden opening and was swinging out 
to point at the ship. Then it found 
its aim and came to rest. 

Nothing seemed to emerge from 
the weapon. But the engine room 
of the ship at the rear suddenly 
exploded outwards and bits of mo- 
tors began blowing away and down. 
The ship lurched into a tumbling 
dive, before the little atmospheric 
ion jets could cut on. 

“Automatic missile killer — seeks 
and triggers material energy motors,” 
Btemdon cded as Egon grabbed the 
controls. “I .thought they were all 
rained. My fault, Egon, my faultl” 
“They aren’t dead yet,” Egon 
shouted back. He was driving for 
the tower, paying no attention to 
any submerged danger. The ship was 
onAy tumbling slightly now, but it 
would land too far west for him to 
see clearly, except from the higher 
tower. 

He knew now what must have 
wrecked his own ship, though he 



had been higher when it happened. 
And from his own experience, he 
knew that the weapon was harmless 
against living tissue. 

He grounded the dugout carelessly 
against the entrance to the Ember 
Stake and sprang through the 
breached wall to the old stairway 
the pilgrims had used. He shouted 
for Herndon to wait, but heard the 
old man puffing behind him. Then 
he was in the Guardian room, staring 
westward. He could just make out 
the great splash as the ship touched 
water, then heard Herndon beside 
him and felt binoculars thrust into 
his hand a minute later. 

The ship was floating, though it 
could not remain up long. But like 
most colonist ships, it was equipped 
better than freighters. Through the 
binoculars, Egon saw inflated rafts 
thrown out, and tiny figures begin- 
ning to emerge. There were twenty 
of the rafts paddling toward the dis- 
tant northern shore when the great 
ship finally went under. 

“They’re alive — at least most of 
them,” he reported. 

He heard Herndon’s breath catch 
in a choking gasp, felt the old man 
relax back away from him. “Thank 
GodI” he heard. 

When he finally looked back from 
the retreating rafts, the last earth- 
man was dead, still smiling through 
a froth of blood, slumped against 
the mechanism that had kept him 
frozen for a millenium. And Gala 
had come to them, staring in shock 
and doubt. 

There was little Egon could do for 
this oldest and longest friend of his. 
He wiped the emaciated face, com- 



THE LAST EARTHMAN 



59 




posed the limbs, and began moving 
the body into die freezer-sarcopha- 
gus. Seeing this, Gala seemed to 
reorient herself and began helping. 
Egon turned on the freezer, bent his 
head, and felt a wordless sob tear 
in his throat as his only farewell. 
Gala began backing from the room, 
and he joined her without thinking, 
genuflecting at the door with her. 

Then there was no time for any 
thoughts except for the rafts and the 
men there. Egon caught Gala’s hand 
and drew the mute girl with him 
back to the dugout. Getting back 
through the near wreckage took 
longer than the heedless trip in. It 
was a quarter hour before the boat 
was moving west again at full speed, 
heading for where the rafts had left 
the spaceship. The sun was already 
beginning to sink again. There was 
a wind from the shore, bringing a 
faint smdl of pine to enrich the tang 
of the sea. 

T here was almost no sign of the 
ship, now probably lying in 
fifty fathoms of water. Only a few 
tiny bits of meaningless wreckage 
were still afloat. Gala caught one 
up suddenly, and he saw that it was 
a thin plastic bag. At her puzzle- 
ment, he reached forward and 
opened it. It must have been hastily 
packed by one of the intended colo- 
nists, then somehow dropped. There 
was a dental gilder, a box, and a 
small book of color pictures. 

Dale! The scenes were of Dale, 
Egon saw. Then he frowned, almost 
doubting his own identification as he 
stared at the drab plains’ sunset and 
the scenes of men and women in the 



almost familiar urban surroundings. 
Dale seemed changed, the people 
thin and lackluster in spite of the 
garish new fashions. Then he real- 
ized his error and grunted in self- 
disgust. In twenty years, his mental 
picture had chang^. He had even 
added beards and bulging muscles to 
the friends in his mind, conditioned 
by what he had grown to accept 
here. 

Gala leafed through the pictures 
and tossed the book overboard be- 
fore he could stop her. She opened 
the box and smelled its contents 
doubtfully. 

“Food,” Egon told her. “It’s good 
food, very nourishing. Try it.” 

She obeyed at once as he reached 
for one of the lozenges he had 
remembered so long and longingly. 
For a moment, his childhood rush^ 
back as it began dissolving on his 
tongue. 

Gala gagged and spat, bending 
over to rinse her mouth with sea 
water. The box followed the pictures 
into the Atlantic. 

Egon started to protest, then 
shrugged. Adults could never recap- 
ture the experience of childhood, it 
seemed. The lozenge was cloying 
with sweetoess and too spicy. He 
sucked it a few seconds more, then 
let it fall into the sea. They drove 
on silently after the rafts. 

It was early twilight when they 
reached the shore and the crescent 
moon was rising in the east. For a 
moment, sorrow for his old friend 
alone out there struck at Egon, but 
he forced it aside and began docking 
the dugout at the little shelter he 
and the last earthman had built. He 



60 



IF 




drew his bow and quivers from oiled 
leather cases and moved with Gala 
toward the woods that bordered the 
tiny beach here. 

There was no sign of the rafts, 
of course. 

They had been driven by paddles 
in unfamiliar hands, and the sea 
drift must have carried them almost 
a mile from his dock. 

The wind was fragrant with the 
acrid scent of damp oak leaves and 
the fainter cleanness of maple as he 
found the old path that led to the 
other cove. They came on wild 
strawberries, and he stooped with 
Gala to gather a few, letting the 
musky, tempered sweetness dissolve 
on his tongue. 

Somewhere an owl hooted, early 
awake and probably hungry. Further 
back in the hills there was a cough 
that could only be a cougar, moving 
with feline grace. He felt his own 
blood surge a bit, and his feet 
moved silently against the fragrant 
earth as he approached the. path 
where deer sometimes came down 
to the little rivulet. The stranded 
colonists would have to be fed, he 
remembered, though that was no 
problem on Earth. 

He was in .luck. A young buck was 
drinking as Egon came up so quietly 
that the animal never startled. The 
bow tautened with life and then 
snapped forward resonantly as the 
arrow sped true and deep. The buck 
gave a single bound before Gala was 
on it, slitting its throat. Egon dressed 
it hastily and tossed the heavy load 
over his shoulder to resume his 
course at a steady trot, breathing 
evenly and deeply. 



T he men were camped where he 
had expected. There were 
perhaps a hundred in male dress 
and twice as many women, enough 
to start a new colony on some far 
world, and there was evidence m 
their foppish fashions to show that 
they all were from Dare. 

They watched the woods with 
scared eyes, but there were m 
guards. No one spotted Egon anil 
Gala against the trees. Most were 
slumped on the ground, and he 
heard their complaints over fatigue 
at the few hours of rowing and 
their desperation at being stranded 
without supplies. They seemed a 
hopeless lot, already giving up. 

But a few, with some in uniform, 
had started a sickly fire and were 
obviously taking a tally of provisions. 
Egon headed for them, drawing 
startled cries from those who saw 
him. He walked past the outskirts, 
carrying the buck, to face a man 
in captain’s jacket who was just 
getting to his feet. 

“You’ll need a better fire and 
some decent food,” Egon told the 
man. “I’ve brought meat. Gala will 
show you how to cook it while I go 
back for another. But you can stop 
worrying about starving here.” 

The captain let his half-drawn 
weapon slide back and came closer, 
staring with a mixture of faint hope 
and disgust at the deer. “Where are 
we?” he asked. “And who are you?” 
“This is Earth,” Egon told him. 
And suddenly he smiled as he swept 
his eyes across the dark forest and 
toward the moon over the sea. 
“Earth. And I am the last earthman. 
Welcome home!” END

This was what Mars was fike

T he sand car r<^ed to a stop at 
the edge of the sand flat. So- 
berly, the driver looked out over the 
broad, bright expanse of sand. He 
had walked the deserts of Earth and 
had seen the deserts of Mercury, but 
he had never lost his feeling of 
wonder at these deserts which, but 
for these few midday hours, were 
deadly cold. 

There was a flutter of movement

at his breast pocket and a flat, 
silky head popped out, peering up 
with bright, intelligent eyes. Tlio 
man smiled. 

“Thirsty, youngster?” 

The yoimgster wriggled. It was a 
rock puppy, orphaned by someone’s 
careless or callous heat blast the day 
before, hi^ on the rim of the last 
deep. The man poured a few drops 
of water into the palm of his hand 
and the silky head nuzzled and 
drank. Then they both peered out at

the yellow expanse of sand. This 
flat could be crossed. He knew the 
way. But it would be reckless, and 
moss hunters are reckless only in 
their dealings with each other. Going 
around would mean two full days of 
rtop-and-go, draining power and 
letting it build up again. Frowning, 
he lifted his mask. A moss hunter, 
long exposed to this thin air between 
the deeps, could do that and stay 
alert, for a few minutes. 

The man scowled, checking power 
and oxygen. ‘‘The odds are long,” he 
muttered finally. “Let’s play it safe.” 

But he continued to stare, frown- 
ing thoughtfully, and finally he 
leaned back. 

“On the other hand, Buster, I’ve 
a hunch we can make it. I might 
have to walk some, but you don’t 
weigh much.” 

He pressed a thumb to the switch 
plate. The motor whined and the 
sand car lurched, its big, meter-wide 
balloons sloughing flabbily over the 
sand. The man relaxed, thinking of 
hot rum and low laughter at First 
Landing. Now and then he checked 
the dials. No power, now, even to 
the compressor which charged his 
oxygen flask. That could wait for 
richer air, in the low country. And 
he was almost warm. Sundown 
would bring cold — real cold. But 
now he was, for a moss hunter, al- 
most comfortable. And his hunch 
they would make it without trouble 
was strong. 

T^resently he dozed, ignoring the 
-a chill that gradually seeped 
through his coverall. He used as 
little oxygen as would keep him 



awake, as little in proportion as the 
orphan in his pocket was using from 
its own organically stored supply. So 
it was nearly an hour before he 
was certain that the figure ahead — - 
the figure that wavered, rose and fell 
— was not just illusion but a man, 
a man walking and so doomed 
certainly to die. 

He locked radar on the staggering 
figure. The silky head again popped 
out of his coverall pocket. The 
figure fell again and lay prone, and 
the front balloon had covered a 
booted foot when the radar cut the 
switch. He backed clear and propped 
the figure against the balloon. It was 
then that he saw it was not a man 
but a woman — hardly, by what he 
could see through her mask, more 
than a girl. And she was new to the 
deserts and the deeps. Hands and 
face were still unmarked by sand 
burns and dessication. And it would 
have taken a well grown woman 
with earth-gravity strength to have 
walked this far into the desert. 

He fed her a dollop of oxygen, 
and her laboring lungs quieted. He 
shook his head at the pleading look 
after the first quick swallows of 
water. 

“Later. We’ll breathe deep and 
drink deep when we get to low 
ground.” 

The girl nodded, smiling weakly. 

“Up on the seat with you,” he 
said. “I’ll walk as much as 1 can 
and ride the step to rest. There’ll 
be power to get us to low air.” 

Soon he lost track of time. Again 
and again he stumbled, slow to re- 
cover, and the car rolled on until 
the switch, keyed to his heart beat,

cut out. He would not set the con- 
trols to circle and return. Back on 
the step he would ride and rest, 
until the blurred reserve power dial, 
rocking toward the red, forced him 
to grip his mouthpiece and step off. 
He was staggering, nearly exhausted, 
when finally the sand car stopped 
again, this time with the panel 
beeping quietly and the radar wink- 
ing '‘On Objective.” 

Their oxygen was nearly gone, but 
the power dials gave them a margin, 
slim, but a margin. He even cut in 
the heaters for a few costly seconds. 
The girl’s head lifted and she open- 
ed her eyes. He saw anxiety in her 
look, but he pointed to a break in 
the rim where a clear path angled 
down* deep into the canyon. The air 
thickened, and finally was rich and 
breathable. 



They were too tired to talk. But 
die girl looked again and again back 
up the path. At the floor of the 
deep, thousands of feet below the 
rim, they came to a shelter, built 
around an as yet unfrozen spring. 

"We made it,” the man said 
tiredly. "Relax. We’re all right now.” 

The girl was silent, but she had 
a cracked, painful smile for the rock 
puppies who watched, bright eyed, 
but soon scampered, chittering, out 
of the shelter, ducking their heads 
and rolling like ermine soccer balls 
out of sight into the rocks. The man 
lifted the baby from his pocket. It 
clung for a moment to his wrist and 
then it, too, tucked nose and feet 
out of sight and rolled away after 
the others. He punched the charge 
buttons to throw the full output of 
the car’s pile into the power pack. 





^ He handed the girl a tid>e of bum 
lotion and motioned to the spring. 

“After you’ve washed off the 
sand,” he said. “And we’ll have some 
hot concentrate in a few minutes.” 

The girl took the tube, watching 
every move. The man shrugged ir- 
ritably. 

“For pete’s sake, relax! We’re out 
of it!” 

Presently she returned, to lean 
back against the softness of the sand 
car balloon. Warm and thick, hot 
concentrates made them drowsy 
even as it built up their strength. 
Abruptly, it was dark. 

n 

A t first light the man was rub- 
bing his eyes, yawning, when 
a sharp “snick-click” brought him 



fiilly alert. He looked up, straight 
into the black muzzle of an old issue 
automatic. The girl stood by the 
sand car, looking white and deter- 
mined, but her band was steady. He 
sat very still. 

“All right,” he said. “You do the 
talking.” 

“I need the sand car,” she said. 

“And this, of course, is out of 
sheer gratitude!” 

The girl flushed. “I am grateful. 
But 1 have to go on, alone. So don’t 
make me shoot.” 

He watched, speculating. He car- 
ried a lot of weapon for this gravity. 
Not many with Mars-muscles could 
handle an Earth weight heat gun 
with any speed. Reaction time would 
— probably — let him snap off a 
broad beam which could not miss 
and still roll aside before she fired. 




THE Fua PEOPLE 



Her eyes were wide, frightened. 
•*Don’t make me shoot, please I” The 
“please” was only implied, but it was 
there. ‘T’ve already hurt one man, 
possibly killed him. I don’t want to 
do it again.” 

‘‘This is the same — just slower.” 

She shook her head. “You won’t 
be alone here long.” 

Carefully he put his weapon on 
the ground, rolled clear and came 
to his feet. At her gesture he stepped 
back. His eyes went over her, head 
to boots. She wore a new coverall 
of some improved plastic, new type 
oxygen mask slung at her throat. 
There was no holster. The clips at 
her belt were obviously for tools. 

“You’re not a moss hunter,” he 
said flatly. “And the only women 
hijackers 1 know of stay inside the 
domes. Who are you?” 

“My name wouldn’t mean any- 
thing to you. But I’m an archeolo- 
gist.” 

“Not right now I Who are you 
running from?” 

She flushed. “I’m not a thief. And 
I’m running from some of your 
friends. And from you. You all look 
alike.” 

“We all get that broiled look,” he 
said wryly. “But we’re not all alike.” 

She steadied the gun. “No! Why 
should you help me. Anyway, there 
are a dozen of them, so what could 
two of us do? Now will you fix that 
switch?’' 

He grinned “So you’ve tried it!” 

He was aware, vaguely, that the 
rock puppies were back — a grow- 
ing, bright-eyed circle, watching 
silently He pushed through them 
absently and they scampered aside, 



to close in after him, curious as 
chipmunks. At the sand car he 
looked at the girl and measured the 
distance to the nearest cover. The 
rock puppies chittered, and one little 
one bounced to the seat of the car 
and then to his wrist. He shrugged, 
placed a thumb over the switch, 
turning a dial with the other hand. 
A hinged plate dropped. He took a 
key from his coverall and turned an 
inner lock. 

“I’m the only one who could have 
done that. The panel would have 
flared and taken off your hand. But 
you can use it now.” 

H e stepped away and the giri 
started the car down the path, 
the big balloons slapping on the loose 
shale. The rock puppies scampered 
and bounced after her. After a few 
yards she stopped and placed the 
man’s gun and oxygen flask on a 
rock by the path. 

“I’ll leave the car at First Landing, 
if I get that far.” 

When she was gone he retrieved 
his weapon and waited. Presently 
the rock puppies returned, to roll 
into a brightly expectant circle 
around him. 

“Bucket heads!” he grumbled at 
them. But they only wriggled and 
ohittered, and presently he started 
flipping pebbles at them. They scam- 
pered and rolled, returning always to 
roll back the pebbles and reform 
their circle. He watched them ab- 
sently. Bxcept for men, and now, 
he thought wryly, women, they were 
the only warm-blooded life in the 
deeps. And unlike men, they harmed 
no one. Why was it, he wondered. 



66 



IF 




that no matter where you went, the 
fur people were, by and large, 
usually nicer than the skin people? 
And why couldn’t these little guys, 
who harmed no one, be protected? 

Territorial Government, he knew, 
talked of policing the deeps, to stop 
the hijacking and protect the pup- 
pies. But Pearsall said flatly it wasn’t 
practical yet. It would take too many 
men, too much rocket-freighted ma- 
terial, both needed urgently else- 
where. So, for the foreseeable future, 
the Bureau would simply continue 
to buy moss, no questions asked, so 
long as the moss hunters took their 
credits and spent them with moder- 
ately good behavior at the domes 
before dropping back into the deeps. 

So, but for the technicians and 
archeologists who worked the mines 
and the ruins in the high deserts, 
the moss hunters were still the only 
Marsmen. 

The moss hunters had come early. 
When the first of the silvery ships 
had thundered in, the men at the 
screens saw only the rioting beauty 
of the deserts, hinted but not re- 
vealed by the photographs sent back 
years before when the probes drif- 
ted silently past. Then the men 
moved out from the ships and found 
the rainbow sands were deadly. It 
was a long time before they learned 
to live outside the ships and the 
first, primitive domes. But there was 
a way . 

For slashed across the lands lay 
the pattern of the deeps — wide- 
flung gorges which within them- 
selves, in places, contained deserts 
and mountains. And in the deepest 
sections, in the cuts of ancient 



rivers and the coves of ancient 
lakes, the deeps held breathable air 
and springs of clear water. 

So while the men fanning out from 
the domes found only ruins in the 
deserts, in the deeps they found 
life — green, clinging life — low- 
branched, leafy life — furry, scam- 
pering life. And with the clinging 
life they found the lichens, clinging 
here and there to the crinison rocks 
of the deeps. 

The lichens brought the moss 
hunters. From them, purified but so 
far impossible to synthesize, came a 
substance which would lengthen the 
days of life. So, drawn by promise 
of gain or seeking a way and a 
place to hide, the moss hunters came 
and stayed and searched. 

A nd from the beginning the 
search took on a strange and 
inexplicable pattern. For most found 
little. Yet some had luck in abun- 
dance and a few, luck which was 
phenomenal. No one knew why. The 
lucky ones shrugged. Playing hunch- 
es they said, and believed it. But 
the lucky ones had had to learn to 
hold what they found in any way 
they could. The deeps were without 
law, and there was, for the lucky 
and unlucky alike, small chance of 
return. Once committed to low 
gravity and no law, most of the 
moss hunters lived out their <^^ays in 
the deeps. 

And that, the man reflected, was 
a lonely way of life. And even if a 
heat blast or the high deserts didn’t 
get you, it was likely to be a short 
life. Men died in inexplicable falls 
and rock slides. And some just dis-

appeared. He, himself, he thought 
wryly, was on borrowed time. Lucky 
Hansen, they called him. But his 
luck couldn’t hold forever. 

He waited, flipping pebbles idly 
with the scampering rock puppies, 
and ruffling the fur of one youngster 
who clung, a chattering ball of 
silky fur, to his wrist. He grinned at 
them. He called them bucket heads, 
but they had the beaver’s instinct 
for engineering. They couldn’t move 
much uphill. But he had seen where 
they had moved fabulous weights 
down hill placed as precisely as a 
beaver fells a tree. He liked them. 
More than once, it seemed, they had 
brought him luck. 

Presently the band scattered, and 
the little fellow at his wrist, whom 
he suspected was Buster, let go, 
tucked nose and feet out of sight, 
and bounced swiftly away. Soon the 
man, too, heard the crush of bal- 
loons on the path. 

There were a dozen of them, moss 
hunters, bitter old pros with burned, 
wrinkled faces and dried out skins. 
They watched suspiciously, looking 
around for his equipment. A big man 
with a beefy face and wide shoul- 
ders hawked and spat and growled, 
“You alone?” The man nodded. 

“Where’s your sand bug?” 

“Hijacked.” 

“Girl, with a baby face and Earth- 
side muscles?” 

“She looked it. I didn’t reach past 
her gun to see.” 

The wide-shouldered man snorted. 
“We’ve been trailing you. It doesn’t 
figure. An old mossback picks her 
off the high ground but then lets her 
hijack him I” 



The man smiled and shrugged. 
“So I’m a liar. You can say that^ 
once. Maybe even twice. But I 
notice your friend there is nursing a 
broken arm, and by the looks of his 
throat I’ll bet he took a judo chop.” 
The injured man grimaced, made 
a strangling sound, and dropped his 
good hand. 

T he big man turned. “I’ll handle 
this,” he grated. Then he 
turned back, looking the man over 
from head to boot. “I’ve seen you 
around the domes,” he went on. “By 
your looks, you’ve been in and out 
of these deeps a long time. But you 
haven’t let your belly sag from high 
living in low gravity. You just might 
be Bart Hansen.” 

The man nodded. “I might.” 
There was a stir, and someone 
guffawed. “Lucky Hansen! Waylaid! 
Probably the other way around, 
Spear, and he just sent her on the 
way. She’s the kind could ...” 
Hansen smiled coldly, and his 
hand moved with unhurried cer- 
tainty to his belt. 

“I’ve been called a liar twice now.’* 
It became very still. Spear 
scowled blackly. But presently he 
brought empty hands into sight. 

“All right. All right. You’re Han- 
sen, and the lady stole your sand 
car.” 

There was little talk, although 
they all watched Hansen furtively as 
he sat unmoving by the shelter. 
Some took quick pulls at flasks of 
concentrate, but mostly they just 
rested. One, spotting an old rock 
puppy perched on a boulder across 
the path reached for a short-barreled

itfle. He found himself staring into 
flie faintly glowing grid of Hansen’s 
hand gun. 

“Let him alone or you’ll lose the 
rifle and maybe your hand!” 

There was the start of an uproar. 
Spear squelched it, bellowing, “Dam- 
mit, there’ll be time for target 
practice later! Waste of ammunition 
anyway. Let’s go!” 

Hansen put away his weapon. 
“Your trigger happy friend here has 
a new model car.” 

Spear nodded. “Out of the last 
shipment pushed up from Vanden- 
berg. New type pile. More range.” 
“I could ride the step on that one. 
I’d like to get my own back.” 
Spear frowned. 

“I won’t slow you down. And I 
know the way.” 

Speculatively- Spear nodded. “I 
hear you do. This a dead end deep?” 
“It leads out, eventually, if you 
know the forks, to First Landing. 
It narrows considerably before the 
climb.” 

Spear rubbed his chin. “You’re one 
of the lucky ones, Hansen. Maybe 
the luckiest of all. You could rub 
some of it off on us. The boys and 
I work together. We pool our moss, 
and we keep trespassers out of the 
deeps we* work. It might be easier 
for you to join us than to buck us. 
Interested?” 

Hansen surveyed the dozen hard 
faces. 

“I’d have to think about it.” 
Spear waved expansively. “Do 
that. Aside from puppy popping and 
a few other such habits Squinty here 
isn’t a bad guy. Ride the step with 
him and think on it.” 



F or most oi the day they traveled 
in silence. Here and there the 
trace of the girl’s sand car showed. 
Hansen was relieved to see that at 
the only turn off where there could 
be real doubt as to her direction she 
had taken the proper fork. She was 
keeping ahead of them, but she was 
moving too fast for economy. Pres- 
ently, Hansen nudged the man 
Squinty and motioned for him to 
pull up front, beside Spear. 

“Spear,” he asked, over the slough- 
ing of the balloons. “Why do you 
want this girl? There are women at 
First Landing.” 

Spear laughed harshly, and Squin- 
ty snickered. “None like her!” 

Then Spear’s mouth hardened and 
he scowled. “You saw what she did 
to Squinty, here. And there wasn’t 
any need for it!” 

Hansen laughed. “I’ll bet! And the 
poor, defenseless girl was so freshly 
one G she didn’t know her own 
strength!” 

Spear scowled and blustered. “No- 
body, man or dame, makes a fool 
out of me or my boys. I lock after 
my boys!” 

Hansen’s retort was cut short as a 
shot cracked thinly. Rock chips from 
a spot six inches from Spear’s head 
showered into their faces. Spear 
swore and sprawled. Hansen laugh- 
ed, but he, too, rolled like a rock 
puppy to a vantage point behind a 
rock. Another shot cracked and 
spattered as Spear crawled up be- 
side him. Hansen grinned. 

“Here’s where you start looking 
after your boys again.” 

Spear only muttered, peering up 
the gorge. Hansen went on.

“There’s my sand bug up ahead. 
Power pack is down, or she wouldn’t 
have stopped. But I’ll bet the water 
tank is dry, too, and my thermos is 
with her, full. She’ll be up beyond 
that talus slope with nothing to lose 
by staying right there.’* 

Spear glared at him. “She’ll stay. 
Even with one G muscles she can’t 
get far on foot. She knows that much 
by now, anyway.” 

Another shot cracked, and again 
Spear ducked and blinked. Hansen 
brushed dust from his eyes. 

“She knows something else, too, 
Spear. How to use that old issue 
automatic of hers. In a steady hand 
they’re more useful here than heat.” 
The others had all scattered to 
cover. Spear sat still, cursing and 
watching. He stared at Hansen’s 
sand car, sitting apparently undam- 
aged up the path. 

“How do you know she’s got water 
and food?” 

“I don’t. And I’m not about to 
walk over there and check. But a 
woman would have to be several cuts 
over average, mental and physical, 
to be sent up here for her kind of 
work. So she’s smart and she’s as 
strong as any two of us. And if she 
disappears, or you keep her here, 
there will be questions asked sooner 
or later. She isn’t just another broken 
down crewman, hoping to get rich. 
Be sensible, man! Let her alone!” 

S pear only cursed. Hansen 

watched and listened, knowing 
well the type. Pride and face were 
involved now. Hansen surveyed the 
rocky slope above. 

“You’re in for a siege, Spear. Want 



me to see if I can talk her out of 
it?” 

Spear grunted suspiciously, and 
shook his head. “I got a score to 
settle with that high-headed snob!” 
“So what? If 1 try and get shot 
you’re no worse off than now!” 

Spear surveyed the talus slope, 
his face working with frustration. 
“We sure could rush her!” he mut- 
tered. 

“You sure could. And she’d sure 
charge admission!” 

Spear let out his breath. “All 
right. Try, if you’re fool enough. She 
hasn’t made you look any too bright, 
either. You talk her down from there 
and we’ll work out something.” 
Hansen’s heart pounded as he 
pushed back the hood of his cover- 
all. He called out, “Listen! I’m the 
man from the sand flat. I want to 
talk!” Then he spread empty hands 
and rose slowly to his feet. The first 
seconds would tell. But there was 
no shock from a hollow-point bullet, 
nor the “who-o-withhhh” of a near 
miss. She was willing to talk, or she 
was no longer there. He hoped she 
would talk. If she had run, little 
could be done. But he had the 
glimmer of a plan, a vague hunch 
forming out of nowhere in the back 
of his mind. 

He moved slowly, his hands in 
sight. He thought he knew where she 
had chosen to hide. If he was right 
she had chosen well. He made for 
it, looking back now and then. 
Spear's crew was well hidden back 
down the path, but there was no 
way up except in the open, and no 
way around. He froze when a voice 
snapped, “Far enough!”

Hansen kept his voice low. **Could 
you use some help?” 

“You still look just like the rest 
of them!” 

“Of cx)urse I do! And in most 
ways, I am! But listen to me. Do 
you know Andrews, from the Uni- 
versity of California? He dug last 
summer in the southern catacombs.” 
“Yes. I know him.” 

“Well, I took him there, and 
brought him back.” 

“You’re Lucky Bart Hansen?” 
“I’m Hansen, and I have to come 
in there with you, or go back to 
them, now!” 

Her whisper barely reached him. 
“Come in, Mr. Hansen, please.” 

Ill 

H e scrambled up beside her. SShe 
had thrown back the hood of 
her coverall and thick, dark hair 
hung to her shoulders. Her oval face 
was streaked with dirt, but it was a 
handsome face, and strong, with 
high cheek bones and a firm chin. 
Fear showed only in her eyes. 
“Why didn’t you tell me?” 

“You held the gun and you were 
determined to run. Would you have 
listened?” 

“No, .1 guess not. I was close to 
panic. I still am. This whole thing 
is insane. Things like this just don’t 
happen. I feel like I was in the 
middle of a Tri-D Video thriller!” 
Hansen sobered. “It’s happening, 
all right, for real. But we’ll find a 
way out.” 

He looked around. She had, in- 
deed, chosen well. She had found a 
rock puppy arena, a play area, flat. 



ringed with boulders. He could see 
where the larger ones had been 
rolled in from above, placed pre- 
cisely. The narrow rollways between 
the boulders allowed a wide field of 
vision. The immaculate little beasts 
had cleared away dirt and rubble, 
leaving a clean, flat floor. 

He smiled at her. “Nice place. 
Homey.” 

She smiled back, tautly at first 
Then the smile spread and was lost 
in her eyes. 

“I like it. Might spend the rest of 
my life in it. But the rock puppies 
moved out. They scolded at me for 
a while, when I was thinking things 
over. Then they scattered, all but 
that big fellow over there. He just 
watches me.” 

Then, thinly, Spear’s coarse beL 
low drifted up to them. 

“Hansen! She there?” 

“She’s here.” 

“Well? What’s she have to say?” 

“Says she likes it here. So do I.” 

There was an angry buzz of talk. 
Spear’s bellow lifted above it. 

“Heard a lot about you, Hansen. 
But I never heard it said you were 
stupid. I can’t blame you for playing 
up that one. But we’ll take you. 
Both of you!” 

A shot spattered dust, and a heat 
ray glowed redly. Spear called again. 

“You’ll get thirsty, Hansen. And 
cold. Think on that!” 

The girl’s eyes were questioning. 
“He’s right, isn’t he? If they keep 
us here?” 

Hansen nodded. “He’s right. If 
they keep us here.” 

“But how can we get away. It’s 
not possible.”

‘'Maybe it is. If we’re careful, 
and if we’re lucky.” 

He was staring down the talus 
slope as if memorizing it. “There’s a 
way, 1 think. But we’ll have to wait 
until early morning, when some of 
these moons set. There’s a new 
model car down there that will out 
distance any of the others.” 

“But ...” 

He waved her aside. “I’ve a hunch 
we can get it. Rest now. I’ll watch.” 

T he girl protested, but finally 
leaned back and relaxed. 
Darkness brought cold. Not killing 
cold, for there in the deep the air 
and rocks held some heat — or what 
passes for heat on Mars. Even so, 
Hansen found himself wishing he 
could roll up in a ball, like the rock 
puppies. He watched the sky. Die- 
mos would not rise for another 
hour. Phobos, orbiting in less than 
eight, would plunge below the hori- 
won in another thirty minutes. After 
a while he touched the girl’s shoul- 
der. She sat up tensely. “Are they 
coming?” 

“No. They have to rest, too, re- 
member. And they’re sure of us. 
That’s why the odds are in our 
favor. They’re warm and comfort- 
able, plugged into their car power 
packs. Now help me out of this 
coverall.” 

“You’ll freeze!” 

“Huh-up. I know to the minute 
how long I can function in light 
insulation. And 1 have to move 
quickly and quietly. Now hand me 
that knife.” 

The girl fumbled for the knife. 
Hansen looked up at the sky. 



“Be dark soon, when Phobos dives. 
Now listen! This will take me twenty 
minutes or forever. If it’s more than 
twenty minutes, you shoot whoever 
comes over this wall. It won’t be 
me!” 

Abruptly, it darkened. Hansen 
went over the wall and the girl 
whispered, “Be careful.” There was 
only a soft rustle in the shale and 
then he was gone. She waited, anxi- 
ety growing, but there was no sound, 
no flash or glow of gun or heat. 
Time seemed to race by, and there 
were only two left of the twenty 
minutes when she heard his low 
whisper and he tumbled, panting, 
over the rim. She worked furiously 
to help him back into his coverall. 
She fed him a breath of oxygen. 

“I’d give you brandy, but Spear’s 
pets rifled my kit. That was a long 
— or a short-eighteen minutes, Bart 
Hansen. — I’m — I’m glad you’re 
back!” 

Hansen huddled, shivering. But 
his head was turned, listening. 

“I’m glad, too. Now, get ready. 
There’s a big sand car down there, 
in the clear. Squinty’s. Remember 
it?” 

“Yes.” 

“I’ll follow you in my own bug, 
in a few minutes. Now, no matter 
what, you keep going. Radar will 
keep you on the path. Now go!” 

Ilie girl hesitated, shaking her 
head. Hansen snapped, “Dammit, get 
moving, before it gets any lighter. 

I know what I’m doing!” 

“All right. But will that car run 
for me?” 

Hansen put his knife back in his 
belt. “It’ll run. The locks weren’t

keyed to his heart beat. Only to his 
thumb.” 

The girl caught her breath, but 
she turned to the wall. Hansen all 
but pushed her over the rim. She 
clung to his. hand for a moment. 
Then she was gone. Tensely, he 
listened. The sound of her descent 
faded. There was no other sound, 
no alarm from the sleeping men 
down the path. Then he heard a 
light rustling, which grew louder and 
nearer, and then her hoarse whisper 
reached him. “Hansen! It’s me. Help 
me in.” 

C oursing solidly, he all but pulled 
^ her over the wall. “What’s 
wrong with you. It’ll be light in a 
few minutes. You’re as stupid as the 
puppies!” 

She sat limply, staring up at him. 
“I — I don’t know what it is. But 
something is wrong. Something tells 
me not to go. It’s — it’s just a 
feeling I have. 1 don’t under- 
stand ...” 



“Nuts! You panicked!” 

“No! Tm scared. But I didn’t pan- 
ic. And — and you weren’t going, 
were you? Your power pack isn’t 
charged. I didn’t set it up. So you 
were going to stay here in the 
middle of this crazy Tri-D show, 
holding off the bad guys! It won’t 
do, Bart Hansen!” 

Hansen crouched silently, listen- 
ing. “Well,” he said finally, “to tell 
you the truth, I’m scared too!” 

For a long moment in the growing 
light they stared at each other. Then 
she touched his arm. “Do you feci 
it, too?” 

He nodded. 

“I’m not angry-scared,” she went 
on, “like I am of those men down 
there. That I could live through if 
I had to. It would only make me 
sick. This is deep-scared, of some- 
thing I don’t understand.” 

Hansen sat beside her. It was 
nearly light, now, too late for either 
of them to run. He put an arm 
around her. Even through the heavy

coverall he could feel her shiverinf 
with cold. 

“I don’t understand it, either. I’ve 
had hunches, strong hunches. But, 
this is — is compelling. We’re not 
under control. I’m sure of that. But 
we’re being told, somehow, to stay 
here!” 

The light grew stronger. Hansen 
looked to his gun and charge clips. 
One thing was sure, he thought sar- 
donically. If Spear’s crew did try to 
rush them, as well they might if they 
lost their heads when they found 
Squinty, they would turn this thing 
into a regular scalp-tingler of a Vid 
show! He started, raising his gun, 
at a rustling sound on the slope. But 
it was only a rock puppy rolling in 
along the top of the talus. It bounced 
in through one of the roll ways, un- 
folding itself and sitting up, bright 
eyed, chittering musical play-noises. 
In spite of himself, Hansen laughed. 
“Look, bucket head. We’ve no time 
to play. Roll! You’re liable to get 
hurt.” 

The puppy only wriggled, and 
rolled over by the girl to peer out 
down the slope. There was a shout 
from the rocks below. 

“They’ve found Squinty,” Hansen 
muttered. 

There was another shout, and a 
shot, and a blind, prolonged play of 
heat from someone angry enough to 
risk burning up his projector. 

Then, as they ducked away from 
the open rollways, they heard a faint 
rumble, and then the growing cra^ 
of rolling rocks. Hansen tensed, his 
eyes darting around. “Rock slide,” 
he muttered. “Both sides of us and 
across! But what started it?” 



A bruptly the rumble grew to a 
roar. There was one piercing 
cry from the gorge below them. 
Then all sound was drowned and 
sight blanked by a roiling cloud erf 
reddish dust. They stared, unbeliev- 
ing, as the sound died away and the 
dust slowly thinned and settled. A 
section of the rocky path below was 
filled now with rock .and rubble. The 
two slides, starting simultaneously 
on each side, had covered Spear’s 
precise area, no more. Out in front, 
untouched, were the two sand can, 
Hansen’s where the girl had aban- 
doned it, and Squinty *s, where Han- 
sen had, an hour before, pushed it. 

The girl whispered, “That — that 
didn’t just happen, Bart! It — it was 
planned!” 

Hansen stood dazed, like a man 
in shock. He turned to stare at ibe 
little rock puppy which still sat, un- 
moving, looking out the roU vav 
Others were appearing now, fr ^m 
beside them and from across the 
gorge. One little fellow rolled up and 
bounced into the girl’s arms and 
clung tightly to her wrist. Hansen 
shook his head and leaned limply 
against the wall. 

“It’s hard to believe,” he said 
finally. “Hunches! The rock puppiesi 
Some of us were lucky, some un- 
lucky. And some just disappeared, 
like Spear!” 

He turned to the girl, and tht 
little fellow who was burrowing his 
way into the breast pocket of hef 
coverall. “Maybe,” he mused, “that’s 
why against all logic I took that 
short cut where I found you.” 

At the foot of the hill, when they 
were ready to start, the girl turned

suddenly to Hansen. “Is it true that 
Territorial Government thinks it’s 
too soon to start policing the deeps?” 
Hansen looked startled. “Where 
did you hear that?” 

She shrugged. “Gossip, I suppose. 
But it’s true, isn’t it?” 

“It’s true. Pearsall say he hasn’t 
the men, or the material.” 

“Well, if he would just come out 
and get acquainted with the rock 
puppies. I’ll bet he’d change his 
mind.” 

Hansen looked around at the cir- 
cle of silky faces peering up at him 
and for the first time since the rock 
slide he laughed. “You know, I 
think he might. But he won’t leave 
the domes. Says he hasn’t the time.” 
“But if we took Buster, here, with 
us when we talked with him ...” 
Hansen laughed again. “OK, Bus- 
ter. You’re the ambassador.” 

At midafternoon Hansen stopped 
at a fork. He pointed. “This is the 
turn-off, but down there a mile is 
a shelter, a good one. Built it my- 
self. We could stay there tonight. 



get some rest, and recharge these 
packs. Would you like that?” 

The girl met his eyes. Her lips 
parted and she looked quickly away. 
Her voice was carefully casual. 
“Why — yes. That would be nice.” 
Then she straightened in her seat, 
blushing. “Nol” she said indignantly. 
“Of all the ... ” But, of a sudden, 
her words were lost in her own 
laughter. Hansen laughs too, and 
they both looked accusingly at the 
flat, silky head which , had popped 
out of her breast pocket. Buster 
peered from one to the other and 
wriggled happily. The girl choked 
off her laughter. 

“This one,” she said positively, “is 
definitely not a baby!” 

Ruefully, Hansen sighed. “ We 
might as well go on then.” 

The girl’s lip pushed out stubborn- 
ly. But she ruffled the flat, silky 
head and her lips quirked at the 
comers. 

“Some things,” she said firmly, “a 
girl wants to decide for herself!”

IF ® Short Story 



IN OUR BLOCK 

by R. A. LAFFERTY 



They were new people in town 
— Of new something^ anywayl 



T here were a lot of funny people 
in that block. 

“You ever walk down that street?” 
Art Slick asked Jim Boomer, who 
had just come onto him there. 

“Not since I was a boy. After the 
overall factory burned down, there 
was a faith healer had his tent 
pitched there one summer. The 
street’s just one block long and it 
deadends on the railroad embank- 
ment. Nothing but a bunch of shan- 
ties and weed-filled lots. The shan- 
ties looked different today, though, 
and there seem to be more of them. 



I thought they pulled them all down 
a few months ago.” 

“Jim, I’ve been watching that first 
little building for two hours. There 
was a tractor-truck there this morn- 
ing with a forty foot trailer, and it 
loaded out of that little shanty. 
Cartons about eight inches by eight 
inches by three foot came down that 
chute. They weighed about thirty- 
five pounds each from the way the 
men handled them. Jim, they filled 
that trailer up with them, and then 
pulled it off.” 

“What’s wrong with that. Art?” 



77 




"Jim, I said they filled tliat trailer 
up. From the drag on it it had about 
a sixty thousand pound load when it 
pulled out. They loaded a carton 
every three and a half seconds for 
two hours; that’s two thousand car- 
tons.” 

“Sure, lots of trailers run over the 
load limit now days. They don’t 
enforce it very well.” 

“Jim, that shack’s no more than a 
cracker box seven feet on a side. 
Half of it is taken up by a door, and 
inside is a man m a chair behind a 
small table. You couldn’t get any- 
thing else m that half. The other 
half is taken up by whatever that 
chute comes out of. You coidd pack 
six of those little shacks on that 
trailer.” 

“Let’s measure it,” Jim Boomer 
said. “Maybe it’s bigger than it 
looks.” The shack had a sign on it: 
Make Sell Ship Anything Cut Price, 
Jim Boomer measured ^ building 
with an old steel tape. The shack 
was a seven foot cube, and there 
were no hidden places. It was set up 
on a few piers of broken bricks, and 
you could see under it. 

“Sell you a new fifty-foot steel 
tape for a dollar,” said the man in 
the chair in the little shack. “Throw 
that old one away.” The man pulled 
a steel tape out of a drawer of his 
table-desk, though Art Slick was sure 
it had beeo a plain flat-top table 
with no place for a drawer. 

“Fully retractable, rhodium plated, 
Don glide, Ramsey swivel, and it 
forms its own carrying case. One 
dollar,” the man said. 

Jim Boomer paid him a dollar for 
it. “How many of them you got?” 



“I can have a hundred thousand 
ready to load out in ten minutes,” 
the man said. “Eighty-eight cents 
each in hundred thousa^ lots.” 
“Was that a trailer-load of steel 
tapes you shipped out this morning?” 
Art asked the man. 

“No, that must have been some- 
thing else. This is the first steel tape 
I ever made. Just got the idea when 
I saw you measuring my shack with 
that old beat-up one.” 

A rt Slkk and Jim Boomer went 
to the run-down building next 
door. It was smaller, about a six foot 
cube, and die sign said Public Ste- 
nographer. The datter of a type- 
writer was coming from it, but the 
noise stopped when they opened the 
door. 

A dark, pretty girl was sitting in a 
diair before a small tade. There 
was nodiing else in the room, and no 
typewriter. 

“I thought I heard a typewriter in 
here,” Art said. 

“Oh, that is me,” the girl smiled. 
“Sometimes I amuse mysdf make 
typewriter noises like a public ste- 
nographer is supposed to.” 

“What would you do if someone 
came in to have some typing done?” 
“What are you think? I do it of 
course.” 

“Could you type a letter for me?” 
“Sure is can, man friend, two bits 
a page, good work, carbon copy, 
envelope and stamp.” 

“Ah, let’s see how you do it. I will 
dictate to you while you type.” 
“You dictate first. Then I write. 
No sense mix up two things at one 
time.”

IF 




Art dictated a long and involved 
letter that he had been meaning to 
write for several days. He felt like 
a fool droning it to the girl as she 
filed her nails. is public ste- 

nographer always sit hling her 
nails?” she asked as Art droned. 
“But I try to do it right, file them 
down, grow them out again, then 
file them down some more. Been 
doing it all morning. It seems silly.” 

“Ah — that is all,” Art said when 
he had finished dictating. 

“Not P.S. Love and Kisses?” the 
girl asked. 

“Hardly. It’s a business letter to a 
person I barely know.” 

“I always say P.S. Love and Kisses 
to persons I barely know,” the girl 
said. “Your letter will make three 
pages, six bits. Please you both step 
outside about ten seconds and I 
write it. Can’t do it when you 
watch.” She pushed them out and 
closed the door. 

Then there was silence, 

“What are you doing in there, 
girl?” Art called. 

“Want I sell you a memory course 
too? You forget already? I t)rpe a 
letter,” the girl called. 

“But I don’t hear a typewriter 
going.” 

“What is? You want verisimilitude 
too? I should charge extra.’^ There 
was a giggle, and then the sound of 
very rapid typing for about five 
seconds. 

T he girl opened the door and 
handed Art the three page let- 
ter. It was typed perfect, of course. 

“There is something a little odd 
about this,” Art said. 



“Oh? The ungrammar of the let- 
ter is your own, sir. Should I have 
correct?” 

“No. It is something else. Tell me 
die truth, girl, how does the man 
next door ship out trailer-loads of 
material from a building ten times 
too small to hold the stuff?” 

“He cuts prices.” 

“Well, what are you people? The 
man next door resembles you.’' 

“My brother-uncle. We tell every 
body we are Innominee Indians.” 
“There is no such tribe,” Jim 
Boomer said flatly. 

“Is there not? Then we will have 
to tell people we are something else. 
You got to admit it sounds like 
Indian. What’s the best Indian to 
be?” 

“Shawnee,” said Jim Boomer. 
“O.K. then we be Shawnee In- 
dians. See how easy it is.” 

“We’re already taken,” Boomer 
said. “I’m a Shawnee and 1 know 
every Shawnee in town.” 

“Hi cousin!” the girl cried, and 
winked. “That’s from a joke I learn, 
only the begin was different. See 
how foxy I turn all your questions.” 
“I have two-bits coming out of my 
dollar,” Art said. 

“I know,” the girl said. “1 forgot 
for a minute what design is on the 
back of the two-bitser piece, so I 
stall while I remember it. Yes, the 
funny bird standing on the bundle of 
fire wood. One moment till I finish 
it. Here.” She handed the quarter to 
Art Slick. “And you tell everybody 
there’s a smoothie public stenog- 
rapher here who types letters good.” 
“Without a typewriter,” said Art 
Slick. “Let’s go, Jim.”

^P.S. Love and Kisses,” tibe giri 
called Mfttr diem. 

T he Cool Man Club was next 
door, a small and shabby beer 
bar. The bar girl could have been a 
sister of the public stenographer. 

“We’d like a couple of Buds, but 
you don’t seem to have a stock of 
anything,” Art said. 

“Who needs stock?” the girl asked. 
“Here is beers.” Art would have 
believed that she brought them out 
of her sleeves, but she had no 
sleeves. The beers were cold and 
good. 

“Girl, do you know how the fellow 
on the corner can ship a whole 
trailer-load of material out of a 
space that wouldn’t hold a tenth of 
it?” Art asked the girl. 

“Sure. He makes it and loads it 
out at the same time. That way it 
doesn*t take up space, like if ha 
made it before time.” 

“But he has to make it out of 
something,” Jim Boomer cut in. 

“No, no,” the girl said. “I study 
your language. I know words. Out 
of something is to assemble, not to 
make. He makes.” 

“This is funny,” Slick gaped. 
“Budweiser is misspelled on this 
bottle, the i before the e.” 

“Oh, I goof,” the bar girl said. “I 
couldn’t remember which way it 
goes so I make it one way on one 
bottle and the other way on the oth- 
er. Yesterday a man ordered a bottle 
of Progress beer, and I spelled it 
Progers on the bottle. Sometimes I 
get things wrong. Here, I fix yours.” 
She ran her hand over the label, 
and then it was spelled correctly. 



“But that thing is engraved and 
then reproduced,” Slick protested. 

“Oh, sure, aU fancy stuff like 
that,” the girl said. “I got to be more 
careful. One time 1 forget and make 
Jax-taste beer in a Schlitz bottle and 
the man didn’t like it. I had to swish 
swish change the taste while I pre- 
tended to give him a different bottle. 
One time I forgot and produced a 
green-bottle beer in a brown bottle. 
It is the light in here, it just makes 
it look brown,’ I told the man. Hell, 
we don’t even have a light in here. 
I go swish fast and make the bottle 
green. It’s hard to keep from making 
mistake when you’re stupid.” 

“No, you don’t have a light or a 
window in here, and it’s light,” 
Slick said. “You don’t have refrig- 
eration. There are no power lines to 
my of the shanties in this block. 
How do you keep the beer cold?” 

“Yes, is the beer not nice and 
cold? Notice how tricky I evade your 
question. Will you good men have 
two uK>re beers?” 

“Yes, we will. And I’m interested 
In seeing where you will get them,” 
Saick said. 

“Oh look, is snakes behind youl” 
the girl cried. 

“Oh how you startle and jump I” 
she laughed. “It’s all joke. Do you 
think I will have snakes in my nice 
bar?” 

But she had produced two more 
beers, and the place was as bare as 
before. 

“How long have you tumble-bugs 
been in this block?” Boomer asked. 

“Who keep track?” the girl said. 
“People come and go.” 

“You’re not from around here,” 



SO 



IF 




Slick said. “You’re not from any- 
where I know. Where do you come 
from? Jupiter?” 

“Who wants Jupiter?” the 
seemed indignant. “Do business with 
a bunch of insects there is all! Freeze 
your tail too.” 

“You wouldn’t be a kidder, would 
you girl” Slick asked. 

“I sure do try hard. I learn a lot 
of jokes but I tell them all wrong 
yet. I get better, though. I try to be 
the witty bar girl so people will come 
back.” 

“What’s in the shanty next door 
towards the tracks?” 

“My cousin-sister,” said the girl. 
“She set up shop just today. She 
grow any color hair on bald-headed 
men. I tell her she’s crazy. No busi- 
ness. If they wanted hair they 
wouldn’t be bald-headed in the first 
place.” 

“Well, can she grow hair on bald- 
headed men?” Slick asked. 

“Oh sure. Can’t you?” 

T here were three or four more 
shanty shops in the block. It 
didn’t seem that there had been that 
many when the men went into the 
Cool Man Club. 

“I don’t remember seeing this 
shack a few minutes ago,” Boomer 
said to the man standing in front of 
the last shanty on the line. 

“Oh, I just made it,” the man said 
Weathered boards, rusty nails . , • 
and he had just made it. 

“Why didn’t you — ah — make a 
decent building while you were at 
it?” Slick asked. 

“This is more inconspicuous,” the 
man said. “Who notices when an old 



building appears suddenly? We’re 
new here and want to feel our way 
in before we attract attention. Now 
I’m trying to figure out what to 
make. Do you think there is a mar- 
ket for a luxury automobile to sell 
for a hundred dollars? I suspect I 
would have to respect the local 
religious feeling when I make them, 
though.” 

“What is that?” Slkk asked. 

“Ancestor worship. The old gas 
tank and fuel system still carried as 
vestiges after natural power is avail- 
able. Oh, well. I’ll put them in. I’ll 
have one done in about three min- 
utes if you want to wait.” 

“No. I already got a car,” Slick 
said. “Let’s go, Jim.” 

That was the last shanty in the 
block, so they turned back. 

“I just got to wondering what was 
down in this block where nobody 
ever goes,” Slick said. “There’s a lot 
of odd corners in our town if you 
look them out.” 

“There were some queer guys in 
the row of shanties that were here 
before this bunch,” Boomer said. 
“Some of them used to come up to 
the Red Rooster to drink. One of 
them could gobble like a turkey. 
One of them could roll one eye in 
one direction and the other eye the 
other way. They shoveled hulls at 
the cotton-seed oil float before it 
burned down.” 

They went by the public stenog- 
rapher shack again. 

“No kidding, honey, how do yoo 
type without a typewriter?” Slick 
asked. 

“Typewriter is too slow,” the girl 
said.

asked How, not Why,” Slick 

laid. 

"I know. Is it not nifty the way 
I turn away a phrase? I t^k I will 
have a big oak tree growing in front 
of my shop tomorrow for shade. 
Either of you nice men have an 
acorn in your pocket?” 

“Ah — no. How do you really do 
the typing, girl?” 

“You promise you won’t tell any- 
body.” 

“I promise.” 

“1 make the marks with my 
tongue,” the girl said. 

They started slowly on up the 
block. 

“Hey, how do you make the 
carbon copies?” Jim Boomer called 
back. 



“With my other tongue,** the girl 

said. 

T here was another forty-foot 
trailer loading out of the first 
shanty in the block. It w^as bundles 
of half-inch plumbers* pipe coming 
out of the chute — in twenty foot 
lengths. Twenty foot rigid pipe out 
of a seven foot shed. 

“I wonder how he can sell 
trailer-loads of such stuff out of a 
little shack like that,” Slick puzzled, 
still not satisfied. 

“Like the girl says, he cuts prices,” 
Boomer said. “Let’s go over to the 
Red Rooster and see if there’s any- 
thing going on. There always were 
a lot of funny people in that block.”

Industrial Revolution 

W hen Seaton and Crane had 
begun to supply the Earth 
with ridiculously cheap power, they 
had expected an economic boom 
and a significant improvement in 
the standard of living. Neither of 



them had any idea, however, of the 
effect upon the world’s economy 
that their space-flights would have; 
but many tycoons of industry did. 

They were shrewd operators, those 
tycoons. As one man they licked 
their chops at the idea of interstellar 
passages made in days. They gloated 
over thoughts of the multifold in- 
crease in productive capacity that

What Has Gone Before — 

T1i« most deadly rivals in the universe are Richard Seaton and Mare C. DuQuesne. Nr 
■lore than a year Seaton has written DuQuesne off as no longer a threat, since in a titanlt 
battle DuQuesne was disembodied and, in the form of a pure mentality, placed in m 
time skids which Is expected to last unchanged for countlets billions of years, lut as ear 
story opens a greup of Norlaminlan scientists have just discovered that there is a flow 
in the mothematics and DuQuesne will be free at any moment. 

Seaton and the Norlaminians resolve to send out a thought message which will alert 
all human races throughout the universe to the danger and to the need for all persons 
of good will to band together. 

Meanwhile DuQuesne in fact is freed and, through the workings of certain other dis- 
embodied intelligences. Is reincarnated in his own body, in a spaceship countless parsecs 
away from Earth. He is ottacked without womlng by unknown forces. He manages to get 
away, but realizes he cannot survive another attack — and that the mere fact of his ex- 
istence, means that the unknown enemy will sooner or later hunt him down. 

There is only one thing to do. Marc DuQuesne builds a powerful transmitter and trans* 
mits a call for help — to Richard Seaton, his deadliest enemyl 



would have to be made so soon; as 
soon as commerce was opened up 
with dozens and then with hundreds 
of Tellus-type worlds, inhabited by 
human beings as human as those of 
Earth. And when they envisioned 
hundreds and hundreds of unin- 
habited Tellus-type worlds, each 
begging to be grabbed and exploited 
by whoever got to it first with enough 
stuff to hold it and to develop it 
. they positively drooled. 

These men did not think of money 
as money, but as their most effec- 
tive and most important tool: a tool 
to be used as knowledgeably as the 
old-time lumberjack used his axe. 

Thus, Earth was going through 
convulsions of change more revolu- 
tionary by far than any it had ex- 
perienced throughout all previous 
history. All those pressures building 



up at once had blown the lid com- 
pletely off. Seaton and Crane and 
their associates had been working 
fifteen hours a day for months train- 
ing people in previously unimagined 
skills; trying to keep the literally 
exploding economy from degenerat- 
ing into complete chaos. 

They could not have done it 
alone, of course. In fact, it was all 
that a thousand Norlaminian “Ob- 
servers” coidd do to keep the situa- 
tion even approximately in hand. 
And even the Congress — mirabile 
dictu ! — ^welcomed those aliens with 
open arms; for it was so hopelessly 
deadlocked in trying to work out 
any workable or enforceable laws 
that it was accomplishing nothing 
at all. 

All steel mills were working at 
one hundred ten per cent of capa-

city. So were almost all other kinds 
of plants. Machine tools were in 
such demand that no estimated time 
of delivery could be obtained. Are- 
nak, dagai, and inoson, those won- 
der-materials of the construction in- 
dustry, would be in general supply 
some day; but that day would not 
be allowed to come until the change- 
over could be made without disrupt- 
ing the entire economy. Inoson es- 
pecially was confined to the space- 
ship builders; and, while every pre- 
tense was being made that produc- 
tion was being increased as fast as 
possible, the demand for spaceships 
was so insatiable that every hulk 
that could leave atmosphere was out 
in deep space. 

Multi-billion-dollar corporations 
were springing up all over Earth. 
Each sought out and began to de- 
velop a Tellus-type planet of its own, 
to bring up as a civilized planet cm- 
merely to exploit as it saw fit. Each 
was clamoring for — and using every 
possible artifice of persuasion, lobby- 
ing, horse-trading, and out-and-out 
bribery and corruption to obtain — 
spaceships, personnel, machinery 
light and heavy, office equipment, 
and supplies. All the employables of 
Earth, and many theretofore con- 
sidered unemployable, were at work. 

Earth was a celestial madhouse 



I t is no wonder, then, that Seatcm 
and Crane were haggard and w<MH 
when they had to turn their jobs over 
to two upper-bracket Norlaminians 
and leave Earth. 

Their situation thereafter was not 
much better. 



The first steps were easy — any- 
way, the decisions involved were 
easy; the actual work involved was 
roughly equivalent to the energy 
budget of several Sol-type suns. It 
is an enormous project to set up a 
line of defense hundreds of thou- 
sands of miles long; especially when 
the setters-up do not know exactly 
what to expect in the way of attack. 
They knew, in fact, only one thing: 
that the Norlaminians had made a 
probabilistic statement that Marc C. 
DuQuesne was likely to be present 
among them before long. 

That was excuse, reason and 
compulsion enough to demand the 
largest and most protracted effort 
they could make. The mere preli- 
minaries involved laying out axes of 
action that embraced many solar 
systems, locating and developing 
sources of materials and energies 
tibat were enough to smother a 
hundred suns. As that work began 
to shape up, Seaton and Crane came 
face to face with the secondary line 
of problems . and at that point 
Seaton suddenly smote himself on 
the forehead and cried: “Dunark!” 

Crane looked up. “Dunark? Why, 
yes, Dick. Quite right. Not only is 
he probably die universe’s greatest 
strategist, but he knows the enemy 
almost as well as you and I do.” 

“And besides,” Seaton added, “he 
doesn’t think like us. Not at all. And 
that’s what we want; so I’ll call him 
now and we’ll compute a rendez- 
vous.” 

Wherefore, a few days later, Du- 
nark’s Osnomian cruiser matched 
velocities with the hurtling worldlet 
and began to negotiate its locks.

Seaton ^ved the Valeron^s air- 

pressure, cut down its gravity, and 
reached for the master thermostat. 

“Not too hot, Dick,” Dorothy 
•aid. “Light gravity is all right, but 
make them wear some clothes any 
time they’re outside their special 
quarters. I simply won't run around 
naked in my own house. And I won’t 
have them doing it, either.” 

Seaton laughed. “The usual eighty- 
three degrees and twenty-five per 
cent humidity. They’ll wear clothes, 
all right. She’ll be tickled to death 
to wear that fur coat you gave her — 
•he doesn’t get a chance to, very 
often — and we can stand it easily 
enough,” and the four Tellurians 
went out to the dock to greet their 
green-skinned friends of old: Crown 
Prince Dunark and Crown Princess 
Star of Osnome, one of the planets 
of the enormous central sun of the 
Central System. 

Warlike, bloodthirsty, supremely 
•ble Dunark; and Sitar, his lovely, 
vivacious — and equally warlike — 
wife. He was wearing ski-pants (Os- 
nome’s temperature, at every point 
on its surface and during every min- 
ute of every day of the year, is one 
hundred degrees Fahrenheit), a heavy 
sweater, wool socks, and fur-lined 
moccasins. She wore a sweater and 
slacks under her usual fantastic array 
of Osnomian jewelry; and over it, as 
Seaton had predicted, the full-length 
mink coat. Each was wearing only 
one Osnomian machine-pistol instead 
of the arsenal that had been their 
customary garb such a short time 
before. 

The three men greeted each other 
warmly and executed a six-hand 



handshake; the while the two white 
women and the green one went into 
an arms- wrapped group; each talk- 
ing two hundred words to the min- 
ute. 

A couple of days later, the Nor- 
laminian task-force arrived and a 
council of war was held that lasted 
for one full working day. Then, the 
defense planned in length and in 
depth, construction began: Seaton 
and Crane sat in the two master-con- 
trol helmets of the Brain. Rovol 
worked with the brain of the Norla- 
minian spaceship. Dozens of other 
operators, men and women, worked 
at and with other, less powerful de- 
vices. 

O n the surface of a nearby planet, 
ten thousand square miles of 
land were leveled and paved to form 
the Area of Work. Stacks and piles 
and rows and assortments of hun- 
dreds of kinds of structural members 
appeared as though by magic. Gigan- 
tic beams of force, made visible by a 
thin and dusty pseudo-mist, flashed 
here and there; seizing this member 
and that and these and them and 
those and joining them together with 
fantastic speed to form enormous 
towers and platforms and telescope- 
like things and dirigible tubes and 
projectors. 

Some of these projectors took con- 
tainers of pure force out to white 
dwarf stars after neutronium. Others 
took faidons — those indestructible 
jewels that are the sine qua non of 
higher-order operation — out to the 
cores of stars to be worked into lens- 
es of various shapes and sizes. Out 
into the environment of scores of 



SKYLARK DuQUESME 



87 




millions of degrees of temperature 
and ot scores of millions of tons per 
square inch of pressure that is the 
only environment in which the faidon 
can be worked by any force known 
to the science of man. 

The base-line, which was to be 
builr of enormous, absolutely rigid 
beams ot force, could not be of 
planetary, or even of orbital dimen- 
sions. It had to extend, a precisely 
measured length, from the core of 
a star to that of another, having as 
nearly as possible the same proper 
motion, over a hundred parsecs away. 
Thus it took over a week to build 
and to calibrate that base-line; but, 
once that was done, the work went 
fast. 

ITie most probable lines of ap- 
proach were blocked by fourth-, 
fifth-, and sixth-order installations of 
tremendous range and of planetary 
power: less probable ones by de- 
fenses of somewhat lesser might; su- 
persensitive detector webs fanned out 
everywhere. And this work, which 
would have required years a short 
time before, was only a matter of a 
couple of weeks for the gigantic con- 
structor-projectors now filling the en- 
tire Area of Work. 

When everything that anyone 
could think of doing had been done, 
Seaton lit his pipe, jammed both 
hands into his pockets, and turned to 
his wife. “Well, we’ve got it made — 
now what are we going to do with 
it? Sit on our hands until Blackie Du- 
Quesne trips a trigger or some Good 
Samaritan answers our call? I’d give 
three nickels to know whether he’s 
loose yet or not, and if he is loose, 
just where he is at this moment.” 



**I’d raise you a dime,” she said; 
and then, since Dorothy Seaton con- 
cealed an extremely useful brain un- 
der her red curls, she added slowly, 
“And maybe . you know what the 
Norlaminians deduced: that, upon 
liberation, he’d be rematerialized? 
That he’d have a very good space- 
ship. That, before attacking us, he 
would recruit personnel, both men 
and women, both from need of their 
help and from loneliness . wait up 
— loneliness! Who — a girl, probably 
— would he get loneliest for?” 

Seaton snapped his fingers. “I 
can make an awfully good guess. 
Hunkie de Marigny.” 

“Hunkie de Who? Oh, I remem- 
ber. That big moose with the black 
hair and the shape.” 

Seaton laughed. “Funny, isn’t it, 
that such an accurate description can 
be so misleading? But my guess is, if 
he’s back she knows it ... I think 
it’d be smart to flip myself over to 
the Bureau and see what I can find 
out. Want to come along?” 

“Uh-uh; she isn’t my dish of tea.” 

S eaton projected his solid-seeming 
simulacrum of pure force to dis- 
tant Tellus, to Washington, and to 
the sidewalk in front of the Bureau. 
He mounted the steps, entered the 
building, said “Hi, Gorgeous” to the 
shapely blonde receptionist, and took 
an elevator to the sixteenth floor; 
where he paused briefly in thought. 

He hadn’t better see Hunkie first, 
or only: Ferdinand Scott, the 

world’s worst gossip, would talk about 
it, and Hunkie would draw her own 
conclusions. He’d pull Scotty’s teeth 
first.

Wherefore he turned Into the lab- 

oratcry beside the one that once had 
been his own. “Hi, Scotty,” he said, 
bolding out his hand, “Don’t tell me 
they’ve actually got you working for 
1 change.” 

Scott, a chunky youth with straw- 
colored hair that needed cutting, 
jumped off of his stool and shook 
hands vigorously. “Hi, Dickie, old 
top! Alla time work. ‘Slavey’ Scott; 
that’s me. But boy oh boy, did I goof 
on that ‘Nobody Holme’ bit! You 
and that bottle of waste solution, that 
you stirred the whole world up with 
like goulash! Why can’t anything like 
that ever happen to me? But I s’pose 
I’d’ve blown the whole world to 
hellangone up instead of just putting 
h into the God-awful shape it’s in 
now, like you and Blackie DuQuesne 
did. Wowy what a mess!” 

“Yeah. Speaking of DuQuesne — 
seen him lately?” 

“Not since tihe big bust. The Nor- 
laminians probably know all about 
him.” 

“They don’t. I asked. They lost 
him.” 

“Well, you might ask Hunkie de 
Marigny. She’ll know if anybody 
does.” 

“Oh — she still here?” 

“Yeah. Most of us are, and will 
be.” 

Seaton chatted for another minute, 
then, “Take it easy, guy,” he said; 
and went up the corridor to Room 
1631. The door was wide open, so 
he went in without knocking. 

“Park it. Be with you in a mo- 
ment,” a smooth contralto voice 
said, and Seaton sat down on a chair 
near the door. 



The woman — ^Doctor Stephanie dc 
Marigny, nuclear physicist and good 
at her trade — kept both eyes fas- 
tened on a four-needle meter about 
eighteen inches in front of her nose. 
Her well-kept hands and red-nailed 
fingers, working blind with the sure 
precision of those of a world-cham- 
pion typist, opened and closed 
switches, moved sliders and levers, 
and manipulated a dozen of so ver- 
nier knobs in tiny arcs. 

There was nothing to show any 
uninformed observer what she was 
doing. Whatever it was that she was 
working on could have been behind 
that instrument-filled panel — or down 
in some sub-basement — or at the 
Proving Grounds down the Potomac 
— or a million miles or parsecs out 
in space. Whatever it was or where- 
ever, as she worked the four needles 
of the master-meter moved closer 
and closer together as each needle 
approached the center-zero mark of 
the meter’s scale — 

Until finally the four hair-thin flat 
needles were exactly in line with each 
other and with the hair-thin zero 
mark. Whereupon four heavy plung- 
ers drove home and every light on 
the panel flashed green and went 
out. 

“On the button,” she said then, 
aloud. She rose to her feet, stretched 
as gracefully and luxuriously and un- 
selfconsciously as does a cat, and 
turned toward her visitor. 

“Hi, Hunkie,” Seaton said. “Can 
you spare me a minute?” 

“Nice to see you again, Dick.” She 
came toward him, hand outstretched. 
“I could probably be talked into 
making it two minutes.”

^"T^he word *'big”, while true, was 
both inadequate and misleading. 
Stephanie de Marigny was tall — five 
feet ten in her nylons — and looked 
even taller because ol her three-inch 
heels, her erect posture, and because 
of the mass of jet-black hair piled 
high on her head. 

Her breasts jutted; her abdomen 
was flat and hard; her wide, flat hips 
flared out from a startlingly narrow 
waist; and her legs would have made 
any professional glamour-photogra- 
pher drool. And her face, if not as 
beautiful as her body, was fully as 
striking. Her unplucked eyebrows, as 
black as her hair, were too long and 
too thick and too bushy and grew too 
nearly together above a nose that 
was as much of a beak as DuQuesne’s 
own, TTie lashes over her deep brown 
eyes were simply incredible. Her 
cheekbones were too large and too 
prominent. Her fire-engine-red mouth 
was too big. Her square chin and her 
hard, clean line of jaw were too out- 
standing; demanded too much notice. 
Her warm, friendly, dimple-display- 
ing smile, however, revealed the 
charm that was actually hers. 

Seaton said, “As always, you’re 
really a treat for the optic nerve.” 
She ignored the compliment. “You 
aren’t; you look like a catastrophe 
looking for a place to happen. You 
ought to take better care of yourself, 
Dick. Get some sleep once in a 
while.” 

“I’m going to, as soon as I can. 
But what I came in for — have you 
heard anything of Blackie lately?” 
“No. Not since he got delusions 
of grandeur. Why? Should I have?” 
“Not that I know of. I just thought 



maybe you two had enough ot a 
thing on so you’d keep in touch.” 
“Uh-uh. 1 ran around with him a 
little, is all. Nothing serious. Of al 
the men 1 know who understand ami 
appreciate good music, he’s tha 
youngest, the best-looking, and tha 
most fun. Also the biggest. I can wear 
high heels and not tower over him, 
which 1 can’t do with most men . .” 
She paused, nibbling at her lower lip, 
then went on, “My best guess is that 
he’s out on one of the new planeti 
somewhere, making several hundred 
thousand tax-free dollars per year. 
That’s what I’m going to be doing as 
soon as 1 finish Observers’ School 
here.” 

“You’re the gal who can do it, toa 
Luck, Hunkie.” 

“Same to you, Dick. Drop is 
again, any time you’re around.” 

And aboard the Skylark of Voter* 
on, Seaton turned to Dorothy with a 
scowl. “Nobody’s seen him or heard 
anything of him, so he probably isa*t 
loose yet. I hate this waiting. Corn- 
found it, 1 wish the big black ape 
would get loose and start something!” 
Although Seaton did not know it, 
DuQuesne had, and was about to. 

It happened that night, after Sear 
ton had gone to bed. 

T he message came in loud and 
clear on Seaton’s private all- 
hours receiver, monitored and direct- 
ed by the unsleeping Brain: 

“. Seaton reply on tight beam 
of the sixth stop DuQuesne calling 
Seaton reply on tight beam of the 
sixth stop DuQuesne calling . .” 
Coming instantly awake at the 
sound of his name, Seaton kicked

IF 




off the covefs, thought a light on, 

and, setting hands and feet, made 
a gymnast’s twisting, turning leap 
over Dorothy without touching her. 
There was plenty of room on his own 
side of the bed, but the direct route 
was quicker. He landed on his feet, 
took two quick steps, and slapped the 
remote-control helmet on his head. 

‘Trace this call. Hit its source with 
a tight beam of the sixth,” he thought 
into the helmet; then took it off and 
said aloud, “You’re coming in loud 
and clear. What gives?” 

“Lx)ud and clear here. All hell’s 
out for noon. I just met the damn- 
dest alien any science-fiction fan ever 
imagined — teeth, wings, tail — the 

works. Klazmon by name; boss of 
two hundred forty-one planets full of 
monsters just like him. He’s decided 
that all humanity everywhere should 
be liquidated; and it looks as though 
he may have enough stuff to do just 
that.” 

Dorothy had sat up in bed, sleep- 
ily. She made a gorgeously beautiful 
picture, Seaton thought; wearing a 
wisp of practically nothing and her 
hair a tousled auburn riot. As the 
sense of DuQuesne’s words struck 
home, however, a look of horror 
spread over her face and she started 
to say something; but Seaton touched 
his lips with a forefinger and she, 
wide awake now, nodded. 

“Nice summary, DuQuesne,” Sea- 
ton said then. “Now break it down 
into smaller pieces, huh?” and Du- 
Quesne went on to give a verbatim 
report of his interview with Llanzlan 
Klazmon of the Realm of the Llurdi. 

“So much for facts,” DuQuesne 
said. “Now for inferences and deduc- 



tions. You know how, when you’re 
thinking with anyone, other informa- 
tion, more or less relevant and more 
or less clear, comes along? A sort of 
side-band effect?” 

“Yeah, always. I can see how you 
picked up the business about the 
stranger ships that way. But how sure 
are you that those seventeen ships 
were Fenachrone?” 

“Positive. That thought was clear. 
And for that matter, there must be 
others running around loose some- 
where. How possible is it, do you 
think, to wipe out completely a race 
that has had spaceships as long as 
they have?” 

“Could be,” agreed Seaton. “And 
this ape Klazmon figured it that we 
were the same race, basically, both 
mentally — savage, egocentric, homi- 
cidal — and physically. How could he 
arrive at any such bobbled-up, cock- 
eyed conclusions as that?” 

“For him, easily enough. Klazmon 
is just about as much like us as we 
are like those X-planet cockroaches. 
Imagine a man-sized bat, with a 
super-able tail, cat’s eyes and teeth, 
humanoid arms and hands, a breast- 
bone like the prow of a battleship, 
pectoral muscles the size of forty- 
pound hams, and — ” 

“Wait up a sec — this size thing. 
His projection?” 

“That’s right. Six feet tall. He 
wasn’t the type to shrink or expand 
it.” 

“I’ll buy that. And strictly logical 
— with their own idea of what logic 
is.” 

“Check. According to which logic 
we’re surplus population and are to 
be done away with. So I decided to

warn you as to what the human race 
is up against and to suggest a meet- 
ing with you that we know can’t be 
listened in on. Check?” 

Definitely. We’ll lock our sixths 
on and instruct our computers to 
compute and effect rendezvous at 
null relative velocity in minimum 
time. Can do?” 

“Can do — am doing,” DuQuesne 
said; and Seaton, donning his helmet, 
perceived that the only fifth- or 
sixth-order stuff anywhere near the 
Skylark of VaJeron — except what she 
was putting out herself, <rf course — 
was the thin, tight beam that was the 
base-line. 

Seaton thought into his helmet for 
a few seconds; then, discarding it, 
he went around the bed, got into it 
on his own ade, and started to kiss 
Dorothy a second good night. 

“But, Dick,” she protested. “That 
DuQuesne! Do you think it’s safe to 
let him come actually aboard?” 

“Yes. Not only safe, but necessary 
— we don’t want to be blabbing that 
kind of stuff all over a billion parsecs 
of space. And safe because I still say 
we’re better than he is at anything he 
wants to start, for fun, money, chalk, 
or marbles. So good night again, ace 
of my bosom.” 

“Hadn’t you better notify some- 
body else first? Especially the Nor- 
laminians?” 

“You said it, presh; I sure should.” 
Seaton put on his helmet; and it was 
a long time before either of the 
Seatons got back to sleep. Long for 
Dorothy, heroically keeping eyes 
closed and breathing regularly so that 
her husband would not know how 
shaken and terrified she really was; 



long for Seaton himself, who lay 
hour upon endless hour, hands linked 
behind his head, gray eyes staring 
fiercely up into the darkness. 

It had been a long time since Rich- 
ard Ballinger Seaton and Marc C. 
DuQuesne had locked horns last. This 
galaxy — this cluster — this whole First 
Universe was not large enough for 
the two of them. When they met 
again one of them would dispose of 
the other. 

It was as simple as th^t. Yet Sea- 
ton had accepted a call for help. The 
whole enormous complex of defenses 
diat he had labored so hard and long 
to erect against DuQuesne would now 
be diverted to another, perhaps even 
a greater, threat to the safety of civ- 
ilization. It was right and proper that 
thk should be so. 

But Seaton knew that whatever the 
best interests of dvilization in this 
matter, there could and would never 
be any greater personal threat to 
himself than was incarnate in the 
cold, hard, transcendentaHy logical 
person of Blackie DuQuesne.

Among the Jelmi 

A nd half a universe away other 
events were moving to fruition. 
As has been said, the eight hundred 
Jelmi aboard the ship that had once 
been a Llurdan cruiser were the se- 
lected pick of the teeming billions of 
their race inhabiting two hundred 
forty-one planets. The younger ones 
had been selected for brains, ability, 
and physical perfection; the older 
ones for a hundred years or more of

•tftstanding sdentific achievement. 
And of the (^der group, Tammon 
itood out head and shoulders above 
afl the rest. He was the Einstein of his 
race. 

He looked a vigorous, bushily 
gray-haired sixty; but was in fact two 
hundred eleven Mallidaxian years 
old. 

Tammon was poring over a com- 
puted graph, measuring its various 
characteristics with vernier calipers, 
a filar microscope, and an integrat- 
ing planimeter, when Mergon and 
Luloy came swinging hand in hand 
into his laboratory. Both were now 
fully recovered from the wounds they 
had suffered in that hand-to-hand 
battle with the Llurdi on now-far- 
distant Llurdiax. Muscles moved 
smoothly under the unblemished 
bronze of Mergon’s skin; Luloy’s 
swirling shoulder-length mop of 
gleaming chestnut hair was a turbu- 
lent glory. 

“Hail, Tamm,” the two said in 
unison, and Mergon went on: “Have 
you unscrewed the inscrutability of 
that anomalous peak yet?” 

Tammon picked up another chart 
and scowled at a sharp spike going 
up almost to the top of the scale, 
“This? Tm not exactly sure yet, but 
I may have. At least, by recomput- 
ing with an entirely new and more- 
than-somewhat weird set of deter 
minors, I got this,” and he ran his 
fingertip along the smooth curve on 
the chart he had been studying. 

Mergon whistled through his teeth 
and Luloy, after staring for a mo- 
ment said, “Wonderful! Expound, oh 
sage, and elucidate.” 

“It had to have at least one com- 



ponent in the sixth, on the levd of 
thought, but no known detcrminori 
would affect it. Therefore I applied 
the mathematics of symbolic logic to 
a wide variety of hunches, dreams, 
Fve - been - here - or - done - thb- 
befores, premonitions, intuitions . 

“Llenderllon’s eyeballs!” Luloy 
broke in. “So that was what you ran 
us all through the wringer for, a whilo 
back.” 

“Precisely. Using these new deter- 
minors in various configurations — 
dictated not by mathematical reason- 
ing, but by luck and by hunch and 
by perseverance — I finally obtained 
a set of uniquely manipulable deter- 
minants that yielded this final smooth 
curve, the exactly fitting equation of 
which reduces beautifully to . 

“Hold it, Tamm,” Mergon said, 
“you’re losing me,” and Luloy add- 
ed, 

“You lost me long ago. What does 
it meatiT 

“It will take years to explore its 
ramifications, but one fact is clear: 
the fourth dimension of space does 
actually exist. Therefore the conclu- 
sion seems inescapable that ...” 

“Stop it!” Luloy snapped. “This is 
terribly dangerous stuff to be talk- 
ing about. That terrific kind of a 
breakthrough is just exactly what 
Klazmon — the beast! — has been af- 
ter for years. And you know very 
well that we’re not really free; that 
he has us under constant surveil- 
lance.” 

“But by detector only,” Mergon 
said. “A full working projection at 
this distance? Uh-uh. It might be 
smart, though, to be a little on the 
careful side, at that”

D ays lengthened into weeks. The 
ex-Llurdan cruiser, renamed the 
Mallidax and converted into a Jelman 
worldlet, still hurtled along a right- 
line course toward the center of the 
First Universe, at a positive-and-neg- 
ative acceleration that would keep 
her — just barely! — safe against col- 
lision with intergalactic clouds of gas 
or dust. 

The objective of their flight was a 
small sun, among whose quite undis- 
tinguished family of planets were a 
moderate-sized oxygen-bearing world 
and its rather large, but otherwise un- 
interesting companion moon. 

Tammon, hot on the trail of his 
breakthrough in science, kept his 
First Assistant Mergon busy four- 
teen or sixteen hours per day design- 
ing and building — and sometimes in- 
venting — new and extremely special 
gear; and Mergon in turn drove 
Luloy, his wife and Girl Friday, as 
hard as he drove himself. 

Tammon, half the time, wore ar- 
mor and bdlion-volt gloves against 
the terribly lethal forces he was toss- 
ing so nonchalantly from point to 
point. Mergon, only slightly less 
powerfully insulated, had to keep his 
variable-density goggles practically 
opaque against the eye-tearing fre- 
quencies of his welding arcs. And 
even Luloy, much as she detested the 
feel of clothing against her skin, was 
as armored and as insulated as was 
either of the- men as she tested and 
checked and double-checked and op- 
eratedi with heavily gloved flying fin- 
gers, the maze of unguarded contit^ 
that was her constructor station. 

And all the other Jehni were work- 
ing just as hard; even — or especially? 



— Master Biologist Sennlloy: who, 
with her long, thick braids of Norse- 
goddess hair piled high on her head 
and held in place by a platinum-fili- 
gree net, was delving deeper and ever 
deeper into the mystery of life. 

A ny research man worth his ssdt 
must not be the type to give up: 
he must be able to keep on butting 
his head against a stone wall indef- 
initely without hoisting the white flag. 
Thus, Tammon developed the theory 
after theory after theory for, and 
Mergon and Luloy built model after 
model after model of, mechanisms to 
transport material objects from one 
place to another in normal space by 
moving them, through the fourth di- 
mension — and model after model af- 
ter model failed to work. 

They failed unfailingly. Unani- 
mously. Wherefore Mergon had run 
somewhat low on enthusiasm when he 
and Luloy carried the forty-ninth 
model of the series into Tammon’s 
laboratory to be put to the test. WHiile 
the old savant hooked the device up 
into a breadboard layout of gadget- 
ry some fifteen feet long, Mergon 
somewhat boredly picked up as 
empty steel box, dropped six large 
ball-l^arings into k, closed and 
hasped its cover, grasped it firmly in 
his left hand, and placed an empty 
steel bowl on the bench. 

“Now,” Tammon said, and flipped 
a switch — and six heavy steel balls 
clanged into the bowl out of nowhere. 

“Huh?” Mergon’s left hand had 
jumped upward of its own accord; 
and, fumbling in his haste, he opened 
the box in that hand and stared. Jaw 
actually agape, at its empty interior.

“Llenderllon’s eyeballs!” Luloy 
shrieked. ''This one works!” 

“It does indeed,” a technician 
agreed, and turned anxiously to Tam- 
mon. “But sir, doesn’t that fact put us 
into a highly dangerous position^ 
Even though Klazmon can’t operate 
a full working projection at this dis- 
tance, he undoubtedly has had all 
his analytical detectors out all this 
time and this successful demonstra- 
tion must have tripped at least some 
of them.” 

“Not a chance,” Mergon said. 
“He’ll never find these bands — it’d 
be exactly like trying to analyze a pat- 
tern of fifth-or sixth-order force 
with a visible-light spectroscope.” 

“It probably would be, at that,” the 
technician agreed, and Luloy said, 
“But what I’ve been wondering about 
all along is, what good is it? What’s 
it for? Except robbing a bank or 
something, maybe.” 

“It reduces theory to practice,” 
Tammon told her. “It gives us price- 
less data, by the application of which 
to already-known concepts we will 
be able to build mechanisms and de- 
vices to perform operations hitherto 
deemed impossible. Operations un- 
thought-of, in fact.” 

“Maybe we should be pretty care- 
ful about it, though, at that,” Mergon 
said. “To do very much real develop- 
ment work, we’ll have to be using a 
lot of fairly unusual sixth-order stuff 
that he can detect and analyze. That 
will make him wonder what we’re up 
to and he won’t stop at wondering. 
He’ll take steps.” 

^'Big steps,” Luloy agreed. 
Tammon nodded. “That is true 
. and we must land somewhere to 



do any worthwhile development 
work, since this ship is not large 
enough to house the projectors we 
will have to have. Also, we are short 
of certain necessities for such work, 
notably neutronium and faidons . 
and the projectors of these ultra- 
bands will have to be of tremendous 
power, range, and scope . you are 
right. We must find a solar system 
emanating sixth-order’ energies. 
Enough of them, if possible, to mask 
completely our own unavoidable em- 
anations. We now have enough new 
data so that we can increase tremen- 
dously the range, delicacy, and ac- 
curacy of our own detectors. See to 
it, Mergon, and find a good landing- 
place.” 

“Yes, sir!” and Mergon went, with 
enthusiasm again soaring high, to 
work. 

R ebuilding and re-powering their 
detector systems did not take 
very long; but finding the kind of 
landing place they needed proved to 
be something entirely else. 

They had more or less assumed 
that many galaxies would show as 
much sixth-order activity as did their 
own, but that assumption was wrong. 
In three weeks they found only three 
galaxies showing any at all; and not 
one of the three was emanating as 
much sixth-order stuff as their own 
small vessel was putting out. 

After another week or so, however, 
the savant on watch asked Mergon to 
come to his station. “There’s some- 
thing tremendous up ahead and off 
to starboard, Merg. That spot there.” 
He pointed. “It’s been there for al- 
most half an hour and it hasn’t in-

creased by a thousandth of what 1 
expected it to. 1 would have said that 
at that distance nothing could possi- 
bly register that high.” 

“Did you check your circuits?” 
Mergon asked. 

“Of course; everything’s on the 
green.” 

“Main Control!” Mergon snapped 
mto a microphone. “Mergon speak- 
iof. FMp one eighty immediately. 
Deoel max.” 

*Wp one eighty,” the speaker said, 
iHld the vessel turned rapidly end for 
CBcL . ON the mark and decel- 
imdng at max.” 

Mergon whirled around and sprint- 
ed for Tammon’s laboratory. He 
yanked the door and reported, con- 
cluding, “It’s apparently emanating 
thousands of times as much as our 
whole galaxy does, so we’d better 
sneak up on it with care.” 

“Can we stop in time or will we 
have to overshoot and come back to 
it from the other side? That may af- 
fect course, you know.” 

Mergon hadn’t thought of that 
point, but he soon found out. They 
couldn’t stop quite in time, but the 
overshoot would be a matter of less 
than a day. 

“See to it, Mergon,” Tammon 
said, and resumed his interrupted 
studies. 

The approach was made. Surprise 
turned to consternation when it was 
learned that practically all of that 
emanation was coming from one 
planet instead of a thousand; but since 
that condition was even better than 
any that had been hoped for, they 
shielded everything that could be 
shielded and sneakeid up on that ex- 



traordinary world — the third planet 
of a Type G sun. It had an un- 
usually large satellite . and ideal 
location for their proposed operation 
. there were two small clusters of 
dome-shaped structures . aban- 
doned . quite recently . with 

advanced technology all such things 
and procedures would of course be 
abandoned . and there were bits 
and pieces of what looked like wreck- 
age. 

Seaton — who had not yet seen at 
close up any part of the moon! — 
would have recognized at a glance 
the American and the Russian Lunar 
outposts, and also what was left of 
Ranger Seven and of several other 
American and Russian moon-rockers. 

As a matter of fact, the Jelmi 
could deduce, within fairly narrow 
limits, what had happened on Earth’s 
moon. 

But all they cared about was 
that, since the moon was not inhabit- 
ed at that time, they would probably 
not attract undue attention if they 
landed on it and, thoroughly and 
properly screened, went to work. And 
Klazmon could not possibly detect 
them there. 

Luna’s mountains are high and 
steep. Therefore, after ^e Mallidan 
had come easily to ground at the foot 
of one such mountain, it took only a 
day for the Mallidan*s mighty con- 
struction-projectors to hollow out and 
finish off a sub-Lunar base in that 
mountain’s depths. 

And next day, early, work was 
begun upon the tremendous new 
superdreadnought of the void that 
was going to be named the MaU 
lidaxian.

Jelmi on the Moon 

M iss Madlyn Mannis — nee Gret- 
chen Schneider — stood in the 
shade of a huge beach umbrella 
(perish forbid that any single square 
inch of that petal-smooth, creamily 
flawless epidermis should be exposed 
to Florida's fervent sun!) on Clear- 
water Beach. She was digging first 
one set of red-nailed toes and then 
the other, into the soft white sand, 
and was gazing pensively out over 
the wavelets of the Gulf. 

She was a tall girl, and beautifully 
built, with artistically waved artisti- 
cally red hair: and every motion she 
made was made with the lithe grace 
of the highly trained professional 
dancer that she in fact was. She was 
one of the best exotic dancers in the 
business. As a matter of box-office 
fact, she was actually almost as good 
as she thought she was. 

She was wearing the skimpiest neo- 
bikini ever seen on Clearwater Beach 
and was paying no attention what- 
ever, either to the outraged glares of 
all the other women in sight or to 
the distinctly unoutraged glances of 
the well built, deeply tanned, and 
highly appreciative young man who 
was standing some twenty feet 
away. 

She was wondering, however, and 
quite intensely, about the guy. He’d 
been following her around for a 
couple of weeks. Or had he? She’d 
seen him somewhere every day — 
but he couldn’t possibly have followed 
her here. Not only she hadn’t known 
she was coming here until just before 



the started, but she had come by 
speedboat and had found him on the 
beach when she arrived! 

And the man was wondering, too. 
He knew that he hadn’t been follow- 
ing her. Without hiring an eye, he 
wouldn’t know how to. And the idea 
that Madlyn Mannis would be follow- 
ing him around was ridiculous ~ it 
really stunk. But how many times in 
a row could heads turn iip by pure 
chance alone? 

He didn’t dare move anv closer, 
but he kept on looking and he kept 
on wondering. Would she slug him 
or just slap him or maybe even ac- 
cept it, he wondered, if he should 
offer to buy the Miss Mannis a 
drink . 

M iss Mannis was also being 
studied, much more intensively 
and from much closer viewpoints, by 
two Jelmi in an immense new space- 
ship, the Mallidaxian, on the moon; 
and the more they studied the Man- 
nis costume the more baffled they 
became. 

As had been said, the Jelmi had 
had to build this immense new space- 
ship because the comparatively tiny 
Mallidan, in which they had escaped 
from the Realm of the Llurdi, had 
proved too small by far to house the 
outsized gear necessary for accurate- 
ly controlled intergalactic work of 
any kind. The Mallidaxian, however 
— built as she was of inoson and 
sister-ship as she was to the largest, 
heaviest, and most powerful space- 
sluggers of the Realm — was not 
only big enough to carry any instru- 
mentation known to the science of 
the age, but also powerful enough to 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



97 




cope with any foreseeable develop- 
ment or contingency. 

The Jelman sub-Lunar base had 
been dismantled and collapsed. Its 
every distinguishing feature had been 
reduced to moon-dust. The Malli- 
daxian's slimly powerful length now 
extended for a distance of two and 
one half miles from the mountain’s 
foot out into the level-floored crater: 
in less than an hour she would take 
off for Mallidax, the home world of 
Tammon, Mergon, Luloy, and several 
other top-bracket Jelmi of the fugi- 
tive eight hundred. 

The vessel’s officers and crew 
were giving their instruments and 
mechanisms one last pre-flight check. 
Tammon was still studying the of- 
fensive and defensive capabilities of 
Cape Kennedy; Mergon and Luloy — 
among others — had been studying 
the human beings of this hitherto un- 
known world. Everyone aboard, of 
course, had long since mastered the 
principal languages of Earth. 

That Madlyn Mannix should have 
been selected for observation was not 
very astonishing. Some thousands of 
Earthmen — and Earthwomen, Earth- 
children, even Earthdogs and cats — 
had been. There was that about 
Madlyn Mannix, however, and to a 
lesser degree about the male with 
whom she seemed in some way as- 
sociated, that seemed to deserve spe- 
cial study. For one thing, the Jelmi 
had been ■ totally unable to deduce 
anv shred of evidence that might 
indicate her profession — not so 
surprising, since the work of a strip- 
per must seem pure fantasy to a 
world which habitually wears no 
clothes at all! Madlyn, although used 



to being talked about, would have 
been quite astonished to learn how 
interestedly she was being discussed 
on the far side of the moon. 

"Oh, let’s bring her up here, 
Merg,” Luloy said in disgust. “I want 
to talk to her — find out what this 
idiocy means. We’d better bring that 
fellow along, too: she’d probably be 
scared out of her wits — if any — 
alone.” 

"Check,” Mergon said, and the two 
Tellurians appeared, standing close 
together, in the middle of the room. 

nphe girl screamed once; then, her 
A eyes caught by the awesome 
moonscape so starkly visible through 
the transparent wall, she froze and 
stared in terror. ITien, finding that 
she was not being hurt, she fought 
her terror down. She took one fleet- 
ing glance at Mergon, blushed to the 
waist, and concentrated on Luloy. 
"Why, you must . you do go 
naked!” she gasped. ‘M// the time! 
How utterly, utterly shameless!’’ 

"Shameless?” Lulov wrinkled her 
nose in perplexity. "That’s what I 
want to talk to you about, this ‘shame’ 
concept. I can’t understand it and its 
dictionary definition is senseless to 
the point of unsanity. I never heard 
of a concept before that so utterly 
lacked sense, reason, and logic. What 
significant difference can there pos- 
sibly be between nakedness and one 
ribbon and two bits of gauze? And 
why in the name of All-Seeing 
Llenderllon wear any clothing at all 
when you don’t have to? Against cold 
or thorns or whatever? And especially 
when you swim? And you take off 
your clothes too .

“I do no such thing!” The dancer 
drew herself up haughtily. “I am an 
artiste. An exotic dancer’s disrobing 
is a fine art, and I am Madlyn Man- 
nis, the exotic dancer.” 

“Be that as it may, just answer one 
question and we’ll put you back 
where you werf', on the beach. What 
possible logical, reasonable, or even 
comprehensible relationship can there 
be between clothing and sex?” 

While the girl was groping for an 
answer, the man took one step for- 
ward and said, “She can’t answer 
that question. Neither can I, fully, 
but I can state as a fact that such a 
relation .hip is a fact of our lives; of 
the lives of all the peoples — even 
the least civilized peoples — of our 
world. It’s an inbred, ages-old, world- 
wide sexual taboo. Based, possibly 
or even probably, upon the idea ‘out 
of sight, out of mind*. ” 

“A sexual taboo?” Luloy shook her 
head in complete bafflement. “Why, 
I never heard of anything so com- 
pletely idiotic in my whole life! Will 
you wear these thought-caps with me 
for a moment, please, so that we may 
explore this weird concept in depth?” 
The girl flinched away from the 
helmet at first, but the man reached 
out for his, saying, “I’ve always 
claimed to have an open mind, but 
this I’ve got to see.” 

Since complete non-comprehension 
of motivation on one side met funda- 
mental ignorance on the other, how- 
ever, thoughts were no more illumi- 
nating than words had been. 

“Neither she nor I know enough 
about the basics of that branch of 
anthropology,” the man said, handing 
the helmet back to Luloy. “You’d 



better get a book. Mores and Cus- 
toms of Tellus, by David Lisser, in 
five volumes, is the most complete 
work I know of. You can find it in 
any big bookstore. It’s expensive, 
though — it costs seventy-five dol- 
lars.” 

“Oh? And we haven’t any Ameri- 
can money and we don’t steal . 
but I’ve noticed that highly refrac- 
tive bits of crystalline carbon of cer- 
tain shades of color are of value 
here.” 

T burning her back on the two 
Tellurians, Luloy went to the 
laboratory bench, opened a drawer, 
glanced into it, and shook her head. 
She picked up a helmet, thought into 
it, and there appeared upon the palm 
of her hand a perfectly cut, perfectly 
polished, blue-white diamond half the 
size of an egg. 

She turned back toward the two 
and held out her hand so that the 
man could inspect the gem, saying, 
“I have not given any attention at 
all to your monetary system, but this 
should be worth enough, I think, to 
leave in the place of the book of five 
volumes. Or should it be bigger?” 
Close up, the man goggled at blue- 
white fire. **BiggerI Than that rock? 
Lady! Are you kidding? If that thing 
will stand inspection it’ll buy you a 
library, buildings and all!” 

“That’s all I wanted to know. 
Thank you.” Luloy turned to Mer- 
gon. “They don’t know any more 
than . .” 

“Just a minute, please,” the man 
broke in. “If diamonds don’t mean 
any more than that to you, why 
wouldn’t it be a good idea for you

make her some? To alleviate ^e 
Aock she has just had? Not as big, 
of course; none bigger than the end 
of my thumb.” 

Luloy nodded. *T know. Various 
sizes, for full-formal array. She’s just 
about my size, so eleven of your 
quarts will do it.” 

“My God, no. Madlyn be- 
gan, but the man took smoothly over. 

“Not quite. Miss Luloy. Our ladies 
don’t decorate their formals as lav- 
ishly as you apparently do. One 
quart, or maybe a quart and a half, 
will do very nicely.” 

“Very well,” Luloy looked direct- 
ly at the man. “But you won’t want 
to be lugging them around with you 
all the rest of the day — they’re 
heavy — so I’ll put them in the 
right-hand top drawer of the bureau 
in your bedroom. Good-by,” and 
Mergon’s hands began to move to- 
ward his controls. 

“Wait a minute!” the man ex- 
claimed. “You can*t just dump us 
back where we were without a word 
of explanation! While spaceships 
aren’t my specialty — I’m a petro- 
chemical engineer tee eight — I’ve 
never imagined anything as big as 
Ais vessel actually flying, and I’m 
just about as much interested in that 
as I am in the way we got here — 
which has to be fourth-dimensional 
translation; it can't be anything else. 
So if everything isn’t top secret, how 
about showing us around a little?” 
“The fourth-dimension device is 
top secret; so much so that only three 
or four of us know anything about it. 
You may study anything else you 
l^ease. Bearing in mind that we have 
only a few seconds over three of your 



minutes left, where woidd you like to 
begin?” 

“The engines first, please, and die 
drives.” 

“And you. Miss Mannis? Arts? 
Crafts? Sciences? There is no dancing 
going on at the moment.” 

The dancer’s right hand flashed 
out, seized her fellow Earthman’i 
forearm and clung to it. “Wherever 
he goes I go along!” she said, very 
positively. 

Since neither of the two Earthpeo- 
ple had ever been projected before, 
they were both very much surprised 
at how much can be learned via pro- 
jection, and in how short a ti ne. They 
saw tremendous receptors und gen- 
erators and propul sors; they saw the 
massed and banked and tiered key- 
boards and instrumentation of the 
control stations; they saw how the 
incredibly huge vessel’s inoson struc- 
tural mambers were trussed and lat- 
ticed and braced and buttressed to 
make it possible for such a titanic 
structure to fly. 

Since everything aboard the origi- 
nal Jelman vessel had been moved 
aboard this vastly larger one before 
the original had been reduced to 
moon-dust, the dancer and her com- 
panion also saw beautiful, splendid, 
and magnificent — if peculiarly un- 
earthly — paintings and statues and 
tapestries and rugs. They heard 
music, ranging from vast orchestral 
recordings down to the squeakings 
and tootlings of beginners learning to 
play musical instruments unknown to 
the humanity of Earth. 

And above all they saw people. 
Hundreds and hundreds of people; 
each one completely naked and each

one ot a physical perfection almost 
never to be found on Earth. 

At time zero minus twenty seconds 
M ergon cut off the projectors and 
the Earthman looked at Luloy. 

She not only had swapped the dia* 
mond tor the five- volume set of 
books, she had already read over a 
hundred pages of Volume One. She 
was flipping pages almost as fast as 
hei thumb and forefinger could 
move, and she was absorbing the full 
content of the work at the rate of one 
glance per page. 

“You people seem to be as human 
as we are,” Madlyn said, worriedly, 
“but outside of that you’re nothing 
like us at all in any way. Where did 
you come from anyway?” 

“1 can’t tell you,” Mergon said, 
flatly “Not that I don’t want to, I 
can’t. We’re what you call human, 
yes; but our world Mallidax is a 
myriad of galaxies away from here — 
so far away that the distance is com- 
pletely incomprehensible to the mind. 
Good-bv.” 

A nd Madlyn Mannis found herself 
— with no lapse of time and with 
no sensation whatever of motion — 
standing in her former tracks under 
the big umbrella on the beach. The 
only difference was that she was 
now standing still instead of digging 
her toes into the sand. 

She looked at her fellow moon- 
traveler. He, too, was standing in 
the siame place as before, but he now 
looked as though he had been struck 
by lightning. She swallowed twice, 
then said, “Well, I’m awfully glad 
I wasn’t alone when that hap . .” 
she broke off abruptly, licked her 



lips, and went on in a strangely al- 
tered tone, “Or am I nuttier than a 
fruit-cake? Vos you dere, Shar-lee?” 
“1 vas dere, Madlyn.” He walked 
toward her. He was trying to grin, 
but was not having much success 
with it. “And my name is Charley — 
Charles K. van der Gleiss.” 

“My God! That makes it even 
worse — or does it?” 

“1 don’t see how anything could; 
very well or very much ... but I 
need a drink. How about you?” 
Brother! Do I! But we’ll have to 
dress. You can’t get anything on the 
beach here that’s strong enough to 
cope with anything like that!'' 

“I know. City owned. Teetotal. 
I’ll see you out in front in a couple 
of minutes. In a taxi.” 

“Make it five minutes, or maybe 
a bit more. And if you run out on 
me, Charles K. van der Gleiss, I’ll 
. I’ll hunt you up and kill you 
absolutely dead, so help me!” 
“Okay, I’ll wait, but make it snap- 
py. I need that drink.” 

She had snatched up her robe and 
had taken off across the sand like a 
startled doe; her reply came back 
over one shoulder. need a

teough die medium of TV or 
Ispefax. A thousand worlds had 
been photographed by Tellurian 
cameramen and reporters; the sto- 
ries of the Osnomians, the Fena- 
chrone, the Valeronians, even the 
Chlorans and the other weirdly non- 
human races of the outer void were 
a matter of public record. 

Nevertheless, it is a far different 
thing from knowing that other races 
exist to find yourself a guest of one 
of them, a quarter of a million miles 
from home; wherefore Madlyn and 
Charley's expressed intentions took 
immediate and tangible form. 

Madlyn Mannis and Charles K. 
van der Gleiss were facing each 
other across a amah table in a cnr- 
tained booth; a table upon which a 
waiter was placing a pint of bonded 
hundred-proof bourbon and the 
various items properly accessory 
thereto. As soon as the curtain feh 
into place behind the departing 
waiter the girl seized the bottle, 
raised it to her mouth, and b^ed 
down a good two fingers — as much 
as she could force down before her 
coughing, choking, and strangjing 
made her stop. 

‘*Hey! Take it easy!” the man 
protested, taking the bottle from h« 
hand and putting it gently down on 
the table. “You’re not used to guz- 
zling it like that; that’s for plain 
damn sure.” 

She gulped and coughed a few 
times; wiped her streaming eyes. 
“I’ll tell the world I’m not; two little 
wies is always my limit, ordinarily. 
But I needed that jolt, Charley, to 
keep from flipping my lid complete- 
ly. Don’t you need one, too?” 



“I certainly do. A triple, at least, 
with a couple of snowflakes of ice 
and about five drops of water.” He 
built the drink substantially as speci- 
fied, took it down in three swallows, 
and drew a profoundly deep breath. 
“You heard me tell them I’m a 
petrochemical engineer, tee eight. So 
maybe that didn’t hit me quite as 
hard as it did you, but bottled cour- 
age helps, believe me.” He mixed 
another drink — a single — and 
docked an eyebrow at the girL 
“What’ll you have as a chaser for 
that God-awful belt?” 

“A scant jigger — three-quarters, 
about — in a water glass,” she said, 
promptly. “Two ice-cubes and fill it 
vnp with ice-water.” He mixed the 
drink and she took a sip. “Thanks, 
Charley. This is much better for 
drinking purposes. Now maybe I can 
talk about what happened without 
blowing my top. I was going to 
wonder why we’ve been running into 
each other all the time lately, but 
that doesn’t amount to anything 
compared to ... I actually thought 
... in f^t, I know very well ... we 
were on . weren’t we? Both of us?” 

“We were both on the moon,” he 
said flatly. “To make things worse, 
we were inside a spaceship that I still 
don’t believe can be built. Those are 
factsr 

“Uh-uh; that’s what I mean. 
Positively nobody ever went to the 
moon or anywhere else off-Earth 
without being in something, and we 
didn’t have even the famous paddle. 
And posi-c/flmn-tively nobody — but 
nobody] — ever got into and out of 
a tightly closed, vacuum-tight space- 
ship without anybody opening any 



SKYURK DuQUESNE 




doors or ports or anything. How do 
you play them tunes on your piccolo, 
friend?” 

“1 don’t; and the ship itself was 
almost as bad. Not only was it 
impossibly big; it was full of -tuff 
that makes the equipment of the 
General Hoyt S. Vanderberg look 
like picks and shovels.” She raised 
an eyebrow questioningly and he 
went on, “One of the missile-tracking 
vessels — the hairiest hunks of elec- 
tronic gadgetry ever built by man. 
What it all adds up to is a race of 
people somewhere who know as 
much more than even the Norlamin- 
ians do as we do than grasshoppers. 
So I think we had better report to 
the cops.” 

“The copsV' she spat the word out 
like an oath. “Me? Madlyn Mannis? 
Squeal to the fuzz? When a great 
big gorilla slugs me in the brisket 
and heists fifteen grands’ worth of 
diamonds off of me and I don’t 
get . ” 

S he broke off suddenly. Both had 
avoided mentioning the dia- 
monds, but now the word was 
accidentally out. She shook her head 
vigorously, then said, “Uh-uh. They 
aren’t there. Who ever heard of 
diamonds by the quart? Anyway, 
even if that Luloy could have done 
it and did. I’ll bet they evaporated 
or something.” 

“Or they’ll turn out to be glass,” 
he agreed. “No use looking, hardly, 
I don’t think. Even if they are there 
and are real, you couldn’t sell ’em 
without telling where they came 
from — and you can’t do that.” 

“1 couldn’t? Don’t be naive. Char- 



ley. Nobody ever asks me where I 
got any diamonds I sell — I’d slap 
his silly face off. I can peddle your 
half, too, at almost wholesale. Not 
all at once, of course, but a few at 
a time, here and there.” 

“Half, Uh-uh,” he objected. “I was 
acting as your agent on that deal. 
Ten per cent.” 

“Half,” she insisted; then grinned 
suddenly. “But why argue about half 
of nothing? To get back onto the 
subject of cops — the lugs! — they 
brushed my report off as a stripper’s 
publicity gag and I didn’t get even 
one line in the papers. And if I 
report this weirdie they’ll give me a 
one-way, most-direct-route ticket to 
the nearest funny-farm.” 

“You’ve got a point there.” He 
glowered at his drink. “I can see us 
babbling about instantaneous trans- 
lation through the fourth dimension 
and an impossible spaceship on the 
moon manned by people exactly like 
us — except that the men all look 
like Green Bay Packers and all the 
girls without exception are stacked 
like . like ...” Words failed him. 

Madlyn nodded thoughtfully. “Uh- 
huh,” she agreed. “They were cer- 
tainly stacked. That Luloy . that 
biologist Sennlloy, who was studying 
all those worms and mice and things 
. all of ’em. And they swap 
hundred-carat perfect blue-white 
diamonds for books.” 

“Yeah. We start blabbing that kind 
of stuff and we wind up in wrap- 
arounds.” 

“You said it. But we’ve got to do 
something^' 

“Well, we can report to an Ob- 
server — ”

"Trt got a better idea. Let’s tie 
€iie reaily on.” 

N either of them remembered very 
much of what happened after 
fbat, but at about three o’clock the 
following afternoon Charley van der 
Gleiss struggled upward through a 
million miles of foul-tasting mo- 
lasses to consciousness. He was lying 
on the couch in his living room; 
fully dressed, even to his shoes. He 
worked himself up, very carefully, 
to a sitting position and shook his 
head as carefully. It didn’t quite 
explode. Good — he’d probably live. 

Walking as though on eggs, he 
made cautious way to the bedroom. 
She was lying, also fuhy dressed, on 
his bed. On the coverlet As he sat 
gingerly down on the side of the 
bed she opened one eye, then the 
other, put both hands to her head, 
and groaned; her features twisting 
in agony. “Stop shaking me, you . 
please,^' she begged. “Oh, my poor 
head! It’s coming clear off , , , right 
«t the neck ...” 

Then, becoming a little more con- 
scious, she went on, “It didn’t go 
back into the woodwork, Charley, 
did h? I’ll see that horrible moon- 
scape and that naked Li^y as long 
as I live.” 

“And I’ll see that nightmare of a 
spaceship. While you’re taking the 
tot shot at the bathroom I’ll have 
’em send up a gallon of black coffee, 
a couple of quarts of orange juice, 
and whatever the pill-roller down- 
stairs says is good for what ails us. 
In the meantime, would you like a 
hair of the dog?” 

“My God, no!” She shuddered 



visibly. “I never got drunk in my 
life before — I have to keep in 
shape, you know — and if I live 
through this I swear I’ll never take 
another drink as long as I live!” 
When they began to feel better 
Madlyn said, “Why don’t you peek 
into that drawer, Charley? There 
just might be something in it.” 

He did, and there was, and he 
gave her the honor of lifting the 
soft plastic bag out of the drawer. 

“My God!” she gasped. “There’s 
four or five pounds of them!” She 
opened the bag with trembling fin- 
gers and stood entranced for half a 
minute, then took out a few of the 
gems and examined them minutely. 

“Charley,” she said then, “if I 
know anything about diamonds — 
and I admit that I know a lot — 
these are not only real, but the 
finest things I have ever seen. I’m 
almost afraid to try to sell even the 
littlest ones. Men just simply don’t 
give girls rocks like that. I’m not 
even sure that there are very many 
others like those aiound. If any.” 
“Well, we would probably have 
had to talk to an Observer anyway, 
and this makes it a forced putt. 
Let’s go, Maddy.” 

“In this wreckage?” Expression 
highly scornful, she waved a hand 
at her rumpled and wrinkled green 
afternoon gown. “Are you complete- 
ly out of your mind?” 

“Oh, that’s easy. I’ll shave and 
put on a clean shirt and an intelli- 
gent look and then we’ll skip over 
to your place for you to slick up and 
then we’ll go down to the Observer’s 
office. Say, have you got a safe- 
deposit box?” 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE

“No, but don’t worry about that 
for a while, my friend. We haven’t 
got ’em past the Observer yet!” 

A n hour later, looking and feel- 
ing almost human again, the 
two were ushered into the Observer’s 
heavily screened private office. They 
told him, as nearly as they could 
remember, every detail of every- 
thing that had happened. 

He listened attentively. He had 
been among the Tellurians only a 
few short months; in the cautious 
thoughtful way of Norlaminians, he 
was far from ready to claim that he 
understood them. These two in par- 
ticular seemed quite non-scientific 
and un-logical in their attitudes . 
and yet, he thought, and yet there 
was that about them which seemed 
to deserve a hearing. So he heard. 
Then he put on a headset and saw. 
Visually he investigated the far side 
of the moon; then, frowning slightly, 
he increased his power to micro- 
scopic magnification and re-examin- 
ed half a dozen tiny areas. He then 
conferred briefly with Rovol of Rays 
on distant Noriamm, who in turn 
called Seaton into a long-distance 
three-way. 

“No doubt whatever about it,” 
Seaton said. “If fliey hadn’t been 
hiding from somebody or something 
they wouldn’t have ground up that 
many thousands of tons of inooon 
into moon-dust — that’s a project, 
you know — and I don’t need to tell 
you that inoson does not occur in 
nature. Yes, we definitely need to 
know more about this one. Coming 
in!” 

Seaton’s pn^'ection a{^>eared in 



the Observer’s office and, after 
being introduced, handed thought- 
helmets to Madlyn and Charley. “Put 
these on, please, and go over the 
whole thing again, in as fine detail 
as you possibly can. It’s not that 
we doubt any of your statements; 
it’s just that we want to record and 
to study very carefully all the side- 
bands of thought that can be made 
to appear.” 

The two went over their stories 
again; this time being interrupted, 
every other second or two, by either 
Seaton or the Observer with sharp- 
ly pertinent questions or suggestions. 
When, finally, both had been wrung 
completely dry, the Observer took 
off his helmet and said: 

“Although much of this material 
is not for public dissemination, I will 
tell you enough to relieve your 
minds of stress; especially since you 
have already seen some of it and I 
know that neither of you will talk.” 
Being a very young Norlaminian, 
just graduated from the Country of 
Youth, he smiled at this, and the two 
smiled — somewhat wryly — back. 

“Wait a minute,” Seaton said. “I’m 
not sure we want their minds re- 
lieved of too much stress. They both 
ring bells — loud ones. I’d swear I 
know you both from somewhere, 
except I know darn well I’ve never 
met either of you before . it’s a 
cinch nobody could ever forget 
meeting Madlyn Mannis ...” He 
paused, then snapped a finger sharp- 
ly. “Idiot! Of course! Where were 
you, both of you, at hours twenty- 
three fifty-nine on the eighteenth?” 

“Huh? What is this, a gag?” van 
der Gleiss demanded. 



106 



IF 




“Anything else but, believe mc,“ 
Seaton assured him. “Madlyn?” 

‘‘One minute of midnight? That 
would be the finale of my first 
show . Oh-ohl Was the eighteenth 
a Friday?” 

“Yes.” 

“That’s it!” the girl was visibly 
excited now. “Something did happen. 
Don’t ask me what — all I know is 
I was just finishing my routine, and 
I got this feeling — this feeling of 
importance about something. Why, 
you were in it!” She stared at 
Seaton’s projection incredulously. 
“Yes! But — you were different 
somehow. I don’t know how. Like 
a — like a reflection of you, or a 
bad photograph ...” 

Through his headset Seaton 
thought a quick, private three-way 
conference with Rovol and the 
Norlaminian on Earth: “ — clearly 
refers to our beacon message — ” 
“ — yes, but holy cats, Rovol, what’s 
this about a ‘reflection’? — ” “ — 
conceivably some sort of triggered 
response from another race — ” 
It took less than a second, then 
Seaton continued with the girl and 
her companion, who were unaware 
that any interchange had taken 
place. 

“The ‘something important’ you’re 
talking about, Madlyn, was a mes- 
sage that we broadcast. You might 
call it an SOS; we were looking for 
a response from some other race 
or civilization with a little more on 
the ball than we have. We’ve been 
hoping for an answer; it’s just pos- 
sible that, through you, we’ve got 
one. What was that ‘reflection’ like?” 
“I’d call it a psychic pull,” said 



Madlyn promptly. “And now that 
you mention it, I felt it with these 
Jelmi too. And — ” Her eyes widen- 
ed, and she turned to stare at Char- 
ky. 

Seaton snapped his fingers. “Look, 
Madlyn. Can you take time off to 
spend with us? I don’t know what 
you’ve got into — but I want you 
nearby if you get into it again!” 
“Why, certainly, Mr. Seaton. I 
mean — Doctor ^aton. I’ll call 
Moe — that’s my agent — and can- 
cel Vegas, and — ” 

“Thanks,” grinned Seaton. “You 
won’t lose anything by it.” 

“I’m sure I won’t, judging by . 
but oh, yes, how about those dia- 
monds — if they are?” 

“Oh, they are,” the Norlaminian 
assured her, “and they’re of course 
yours. Would you like to have me 
sell them for you?” 

She glanced questioningly at van 
der Gleiss, who nodded and gave 
the jewels to the Observer. Then, 
“We’d like that very much, sir,” 
Madlyn said, “and thanks a lot.” 
“Okay,” l^aton said then. “Now, 
how about you, Charley. What kind 
of a jolt did you get at one minute 
of twelve that Friday night?” 

“Well, it was the first time I 
caught Madlyn’s act, and I admit 
it’s a sockeroo. She has the wallop 
of a piledriver, no question of that. 
But if you mean spirit-message 
flapdoodle or psychic poppycock, 
nothing. I’m not psychic myself — 
not a trace — and nobody can sell 
me that anybody else is, either. That 
stuff is purely the bunk — it’s strictly 
for the birds.” 

“It isn’t either. Mister Charles K.

▼an der Gleiss!” Madlyn exclaimed. 
“And you are too psychic — very 
strongly so! How else would we be 
stumbling over each other every- 
where we go? And how else would 
I possibly get drunk with you?” She 
spread her hands out in appeal to 
the Observer. he psychic?” 

“My opinion is that he is unusually 
sensitive to certain forces, yes,” the 
Norlaminian said. “Think carefully, 
youth. Wasn’t there something more 
than the mental or esthetic appreci- 
ation of, and the physical-sexual 
thrill at, the work of a superb exotic 
dancer?” 

“Of course there was!” the man 
snapped. “But . but . oh, I don’t 
know. Now that Madlyn mentions 
it, there was a sort of a feeling of a 
message. But I haven’t got even the 
foggiest idea of what the goddam 
thing was!” 

“And that,” Seaton said, “is about 
the best defimtion of it I’ve ever 
heard. We haven’t either.”

DuQuesne and the Jelmi 

D uQuesne, who had not seen 
enough ot the Skylark of VaU 
eron to realize that it was an inter- 
galactic spacecraft, had supposed 
that Seaton and his party were still 
aboard Skylark Three, which was of 
the same size and power as DuQues- 
ne’s own ship, the Capital D. There- 
fore, when it became clear just what 
it was with which the Capital D was 
making rendezvous, to say that Du- 
Quesne was surprised is putting it 
very mildly indeed. 



He had supposed that his vessel 
was one of the three most powerful 
superdreadnoughts of space ever 
built — but this\ This thing was not 
a spaceship at all! In every impor- 
tant respect it was a world. It was 
big enough to mount and to power 
offensive and defensive armament of 
full planetary capability . and if he 
knew Seaton and Crane half as well 
as he thought he did, that monstros- 
ity could volatilize a world as easily 
as it could light a firecracker. 

He was second. Again. And such 
an insignificantly poor second as to 
be completely out of the competi- 
tion. 

Something would have to be done 
about this intolerable situation . 
and finding out what could be done 
about it would take precedence over 
everything else until he did find out. 

He scowled in thought. That 
worldlet of a spaceship changed 
everything — radically. He’d been 
going to let eager-beaver Seaton 
grab the ball and run with it while 
he, DuQuesne, went on about his 
own business. But now — could he 
take the risk? Ten to one — or a 
hundred to one? — he couldn’t touch 
that planetoid’s safety screens with 
anything he had. But it was worth 
his while to try . 

Energizing the lightest possible 
fifth- and sixth-order webs, he 
reached out with his utmost delicacy 
of touch to feel out the huge globe’s 
equipment; to find out exactly what 
it had. 

He found out exactly nothing; and 
in zero time. At the first, almost 
imperceptible touch of DuQuesne’s 
wch the mighty planetoid’s every 



108 



IF 




defense flared instantaneously into 
being. 

DuQuesne cut his webbing, the 
defenses vanished, and Seaton said, 
“No peeking, DuQuesne. Come in- 
side and you can look around all 
you please, but from outside it can’t 
be done.” 

“I see it can’t. How do I get . 
inside?” 

“One of your shuttles or small 
boats. Go neutral as soon as you 
clear your outer skin and I’ll bring 
you in.” 

“I’ll do that,” — and as DuQuesne 
in one of his vessel’s life-boats tra- 
versed the long series of locks 
through the worldlet’s tremendously 
thick shell he kept on wrestling with 
his problem. 

No, the idea of letting Seaton be 
the Big Solo Hero was out like the 
well-known light. Seaton and his 
whole party would have to die. And 
the sooner the better. 

He’d known it all along, really; 
his thinking had slipped, back there, 
for sure. With that fireball of a 
ship — flying base, rather — by the 
time Seaton got the job done he 
would be so big that nothing could 
ever cut him down to size. For that 
matter, was there anything that 
could be done about Seaton and his 
planetoid, even at the size they 
already were? There was no vulner- 
ability apparent ... on the outside, 
at least. But there had to be some- 
thing; some chink or opening; all 
he had to do was think of it — like 
the time he and “Baby Doll” Coring 
had taken over a fully-manned 
superdreadnought of the Fena- 
chrone. 



The smart thing to do, the best- 
tliing for Marc C. DuQuesne, would 
be to join Seaton and work hand 
in glove with him — for a while. Un- 
til he had a bigger, more powerful 
worldlet than Seaton did and knew 
more than all the Skylarkers put 
together. Then blow the Skylark of 
Valeron and everyone and every- 
thing in it into impalpable dust 
and go on about his own business; 
letting Civilization worry about it- 
self. 

To get away with that, he might 
have to give his word to act as one 
of the party, as before. 

He never had broken his word 
... so he wouldn’t give it, this time, 
unless he had to . but if he had 
to? If it came to a choice — break- 
ing his word or being Emperor Marc 
the First of a galaxy, founder of a 
dynasty the like of which no civili- 
zation had ever seen before? 

Whatever happened, come hell or 
high water, Seaton and his crew 
must and would die. He, DuQuesne, 
must and would come out on top! 

A s soon as DuQuesne’s lifeboat 
was inside the enormous hol- 
low globe that was the Skylark of 
Valeron, Seaton brought it to a 
gentle landing in a dock behind his 
own home and walked out to the 
dock with a thought-helmet on his 
head and its mate in his hand. 

DuQuesne opened his lifeboat’s 
locks and Seaton joined him in the 
tiny craft’s main compartment. 

Face to face, neither man spoke 
in greeting or offered to shake 
hands; both knew that there was 
nothing of friendship between them 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE

or ever would be. Nor did DuQuesne 
wonder why Seaton was meeting 
him thus; outside and alone. He 
knew exactly what the women, es- 
pecially Margaret, thought of him; 
but such trifles had no effect what- 
ever upon the essence of Marc C. 
DuQuesne. 

Seaton handed DuQuesne the 
spare headset. DuQuesne put it on 
and Seaton said in thought, “This, 
you’ll notice, is no ordinary mechan- 
ical educator; not by seven thou- 
sand rows of Christmas trees. I 
suppose you know you’re in the 
Skylark of Valeron. Study it, and 
take your time. I’ll give you her 
prints before you go — if we’re 
going to have to be allies again you 
ought to have something better than 
your Capital D to work with.” 

Seaton thought that this surprise 
might make DuQuesne’s guard slip 
for an instant, but it didn’t. Du- 
Quesne studied the worldlet inten- 
sively for over an hour, then took 
off his headset and said: 

“Nice job, Seaton. Beautiful; es- 
pecially that tank-chart of the First 
Universe and that super-computer 
brain — some parts of which, I see, 
this headset enables me to operate. 
The rest of it, I suppose, is keyed 
to and in sync with your own mind? 
No others need apply?” 

“That’s right. So, with the prints, 
you’ll have everything you need, I 
think. But before you go into detail, 
I may know a thing that you don’t 
and that may have a lot of bearing, 
one place or another. Have you ever 
heard of any way of getting into or 
through the fourth dimension except 
by rotation?” 



••No. Not even in theory. How 
sure are you that there is or can be 
any other way of doing it?” 

“Positive. One that not even the 
Norlaminians know anything about,” 
and Seaton gave DuQuesne the full 
picture and the full story and all 
the side-bands of thought of every- 
thing that had happened to Madly n 
Mannis and Charles van der Gleiss. 

A t the sight of Mergon and Luloy 
— two of the three Jelmi 
whom the monstrous alien Klazmon 
had been comparing with the Fena- 
chrone and with the chlorine- 
breathing amoeboid Chlorans and 
with DuQuesne himself — it took 
every iota of DuQuesne’s iron con- 
trol to make no sign of the as- 
tounding burst of interest he felt; 
for in one blinding flash of reveal- 
ment his entire course of action 
became pellucidly clear. He knew 
exactly where and what Galaxy 
DW-427-LU was. He knew how to 
get Seaton headed toward that 
galaxy. He knew how to kill Seaton 
and all his crew and take over the 
Skylark of Valeron. And, best of all, 
he knew how to cover his tracksl 
Completely unsuspicious of any of 
these thoughts, Seaton went on, 
“Now we’re ready, I think, for the 
fine details of what you found out.” 
After giving a precisely detailed 
report that lasted for twenty min- 
utes, DuQuesne said, “Now as to 
location. I have a cylindrical chart 
— a plug-chart, you might call 
it — of all the galaxies lying close 
to the line between the point in 
space where your stasis-capsule 
whiffed out and the First Galaxy. 



110 



IF 




Those four reels there.” He pointed. 
“But I have no idea whatever as to 
where that plug lies in the universe 
— its universal coordinates. But 
since you know where you are and I 
know how I got here, it can be 
computed — in time.” 

“In practically nothing flat,” 
Seaton said. “As fast as you can run 
your tapes through your scanner 
there.” Seaton put his headset back 
on; DuQuesne followed suit. “They 
don’t even have to be in order. When 
the end of the last tape clears the 
scanner your plug will be in our 
tank.” 

And it was: a long, narrow cyl- 
inder of yellowish-green haze. 

“Nice; very nice indeed.” Du- 
Quesne paid tribute to performance. 
“I started my trip right there.” He 
marked the spot with a tiny purple 
light. It was a weird sensation, this; 
working, with that gigantic brain, in 
that super-gigantic tank-chart, with 
only a headset and at a distance of 
miles! 

“With my artificial gravity set to 
exact universal north as straight up,” 
DuQuesne went on, “I moved along 
a course as close as possible to the 
axis of that cylinder to this point 
here.” The purple point extended 
itself into a long line of purple 
light and stopped. “Klazmon’s tight 
beam hit me at that point there, 
coming in from eighty-seven point 
four one eight degrees starboard and 
three point nine two six degrees 
universal south.” 

D uQuesne’s mind, terrifically 
hard held for that particular 
statement, revealed not the faintest 



side-band or other indication of what 
a monstrous lie that was. The figures 
themselves were very nearly right; 
but the fact that the beam had 
actually come in from the port and 
the north made a tremendous dif- 
ference. The purple line darted off 
at almost a right angle to itself and 
DuQuesne went on without a break: 

“You’ll note that there are two 
galaxies on that line; one about 
half way out to the rim of the 
universe — ” this galaxy actually 
was, in Klazmon’s nomenclature, 
Galaxy DW-427-LU— “the other 
one clear out; right on the rim itself. 
Under those conditions no reliable 
estimate of distance was possible, 
but if we assume that Klazmon’s 
power is of the same order of 
magnitude as ours it would have to 
be the first one. However, I’m 
making no attempt to defend that 
assumption.” 

“Sure not; but it’s safe enough. I’d 
say, for a first approximation. So, 
making that assumption, that galaxy 
is where the Realm of the Llurdi 
is — where the Llurdi and the Jelmi 
are. Where the folks that built that 
big battlewagon on the moon came 
from.” 

“While the data do not prove it, 
by any means, that would be my 
best-educated guess. But my next 
one — that that’s where they’re go- 
ing back to — isn’t based on any- 
thing anywhere near that solid. Side- 
bands only, and not too many or 
too strong.” 

“Yeah, I got some, too. But you’re 
having first cut at this; go ahead,” 
Seaton said. 

“Okay. First, you have to dig up 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



111 




some kind of an answer to Hie 
question of why those Jelmi came 
such an ungodly long distance away 
from home to do what was, after 
all, a small job of work. We know 
that they didn’t do it just for fun. 
We know that Hie whole race of 
Jelmi is oppressed; we know that 
those eight hundred rebelled. We’re 
fairly sure that Earth alone is, right 
now, putting out more sixth-order 
emanation than all the rest of the 
First Universe put together. 

“Okay. There were some indica- 
tions that Tammon worked out the 
theory of that fourth-dimensional 
gizmo quite a while back; but they 
had to come this tremendous dis- 
tance to find enough high-order 
emanation to mask their research 
and development work from His 
Nibs Llanzlan Klazmon the Fifteen- 
th. 

“Now, My argument gets pretty 
tenuous at this point, but isn’t it a 
fairly safe bet that, having reduced 
the theory of said gizmo to prac- 
tice and having built a ship big 
enough to handle it like toothpicks, 
they’d beat it right back home as 
fast as they could leg it, knock the 
living hell out of the Llurdi — they 
could, you know, like shooting fish 
in a well — and issue a star-spangled 
Declaration of Independence? It 
does to me.” 

“Check. While I didn’t get there 
by exactly the same route you did, 
I arrived at the same destination. So 
it’s not only got to be investigated; 
it’s got to be Number One on the 
agenda. Question; who operates? 
Your baby or mine?” 

“You know the answer to that. I’ll 



have oHier fiih to hy; quite poa- 
sibly until after you have the Jelman 
angle served.” 

“My thought exactly.” Seatoo 
assumed that DuQuesne’s first, most 
urgent job would be to build a 
worldlet of his own; DuQuesne did 
not correct this Hiought. Seatoo 
went on, “The other question, then, 
is — do we join forces again, or 
work independently ... or maybe 
table the question temporarily, un- 
til you get yourself organized and 
we will have made at' least a stab 
at evaluating what this Llurdan 
menace actually amounts to?” 

“The last ... I think.” DuQuesne 
scowled in thought, then his face 
cleared; but at no time was there 
the slightest seepage of side-bands to 
the effect that he, DuQuesne, would 
see to it that Seaton would be dead 
long before that. Or that he, Du- 
Quesne, did not give a tinker’s damn 
whether anything was ever done 
about the Llurdan menace or not 
The two men discussed less im- 
portant details for perhaps ten min- 
utes longer; then DuQuesne took his 
leave. And, out in deep space again, 
with his mighty Capital D again 
boring a hole through the protesting 
ether, DuQuesne allowed himself a 
contemptuous and highly satisfac- 
tory sneer. 

B ack in their own living room, 
Seaton asked his wife, “Dottic, 
did you smell anything the least bit 
fishy about that?” 

“Not a thing, Dick. I gave it 
everything I had, and everything 
about it rang as true as a silver bell. 
Did you detect anything?” 



112 



IF 




"Not a thing — curse it! Even 
helmet to helmet — as deep as I 
could go without putting the screws 
on and blowing everything higher 
than up — it was flawless. But 
you’ve got to remember the guy’s 
case-hardened and diamond finished 
. But you’ve also got to remember 
that I came to exactly the same 
conclusions he did — and complete- 
ly independently.” 

“So every indication is that he is 
acting decently. He’s been known to, 
you know.” 

“Yeah. It’s possible.” Seaton did 
not sound at sold on the possi- 
bility. “But I wouldn’t trust that big 
black ape as far as I could drop- 

kick him I’d like awfully well 

to know whether he’s pitching us a 
curve or not . and if he is, what 
the barb-tailed devil it can possibly 
be ... so what we’ll have to do, pet, 
is keep our eyes peeled and look a 
little bit out all the time.” 

And, still scowling and still scan- 
ning and re-scanning every tiniest 
bit of data for flaws, Seaton set 
course for Galaxy DW-427-LU, 
having every reason to believe it the 
galaxy in which the Realm of the 
Llurdi lay. Also, although he did not 
mention this fact even to Dorothy, 
that course “felt right” to some 
deeply buried, unknown, and impos- 
sible sense in which he did not, could 
not, and would not believe. 

For Seaton did not know that 
Galaxy DW-427-LU was in fact 
going to be highly important to 
him in a way that he could not 
foresee; if he had known, would not 
have believed; if he had believed, 
would not have understood. 



For at that moment in time, not 
even Richard Ballinger Seaton knew 
what forces he had unleashed with 
his “cosmic beacon.” 

xm 

DuQuesne and Sennlloy 

I n the eyes of Blackie DuQuesne, 
Seaton was forever and help- 
lessly trapped in the philosophy of 
the “good guy”. It was difficult for 
DuQuesne to comprehend why a 
mind of as high an order of excel- 
lence as Seaton’s — fully the equal 
of DuQuesne’s own in many respects, 
as DuQuesne himself was prepared 
to concede — should subscribe to 
the philosophy of lending a helping 
hand, accepting the defeat of an 
enemy without rancor, refraining 
from personal aggrandizement when 
the way was so easily and temptingly 
clear to take over the best part of 
a universe. 

Nevertheless, DuQuesne knew 
that these traits were part of Sea- 
ton’s makeup. He had counted on 
them. He had not been disappointed. 
It would have been child’s play for 
Seaton to have tricked and destroy- 
ed him as he entered that monster 
spaceship Seaton had somehow ac- 
quired. Instead of that, Seaton had 
made him a free gift of its equal! 

That, however, was not good 
enough for Blackie DuQuesne. See- 
ing how far Seaton had progressed 
had changed things. He could not 
accept the status of co-belligerent. 
He had to be the victor. 

And the one portentous hint he 
had gleaned from Seaton of the ex- 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



113 




istence of a true fourth-dimensiond 
system could be the tool that would 
make him the victor; wherefore he 
set out at once to get it. 

Since he had misdirected Seaton 
as to the vector of the course of 
the Jelmi, sending him off on what, 
DuQuesne congratulated himself, 
was the wildest of wild-goose chases, 
DuQuesne need only proceed in the 
right direction and somehow — any- 
how; DuQuesne was superbly con- 
fident that he would find a means 
— get from them the secret of what 
he needed to know. His vessel had 
power to spare. Therefore he cut 
in everything his mighty drives 
could take, computed a tremendous 
asymptotic curve into the line that 
the Jelmi must have taken, and took 
out after the intergalactic flyer that 
had left Earth’s moon such a short 
time before. 

DuQuesne was aware that force 
would be an improbably successful 
means of getting what he wanted. 
Guile was equally satisfactory. Ac- 
cordingly he took off his clothes 
and examined himself, front and 
back and sides, in a full-length 
mirror. 

He would do, he concluded. There 
would be nothing about his physical 
person which would cause him any 
trouble in his dealings with the 
Jelmi. Since he always took his 
sun-lamp treatments in the raw, his 
color gradation was right. He was 
too dark for a typical Caucasian 
Tellurian; but that was all right — 
he wasn’t going to be a Tellurian. 
He would, he decided, be a native 
of some planet whose people went 
naked ... the planet Xylmny, in a 



galaxy ’way out on the Rim some- 
where . yes, he had self-control 
enough not to give himself away. 

B ut his cabin wouldn’t stand in- 
spection on a usually naked 
basis, nor would any other private 
room of the ship. All had closets 
designed unmistakeably for clothing 
and it wasn’t worth while to re- 
build them. 

Okay, he’d be a researcher who 
had visited dozens of planets, and 
everybody had to wear some kind 
of clothing or trappings at some 
time or other. Protectively at least. 
And probably for formality or for 
decoration. 

Wherefore DuQuesne, with a hel- 
met on his head and a half-smile, 
half-sneer on his face, let his imagi- 
nation run riot in filling closet af- 
ter closet with the utilitarian and 
the decorative garmenture of world 
after purely imaginative world. Then, 
after transferring his own Tellurian 
clothing to an empty closet, he de- 
voted a couple of hours to designing 
and constructing the apparel of his 
equally imaginary native world Xy- 
lmny. 

In due time a call came in from 
the spaceship up ahead. “You who 
are following us from the direction 
of the world Tellus: do you speak 
English?’^ 

“Yes.” 

“Why are you following us. Tel- 
lurian?” 

“I am not a Tellurian. I am from 
the planet Xylmny; which, while 
very similar to Tellus, lies in a 
distant galaxy.” He told the caller, 
as well as he could in words, where 



114 



IF 




Xylmny was. "I am a Seeker, Scv- 
ance by name. I have visited many 
planets very similar to yours and to 
Tellus and to my own in my Seeking. 
Tcllus itself had nothing worthy of 
my time, but 1 learned there that 
you have a certain knowledge as yet 
unknown to me; that of operating 
through the fourth dimension of 
space instantaneously, without be- 
coming lost hopelessly therein, as is 
practically always the case when 
rotation is employed. Therefore I of 
course followed you.” 

“Naturally. I would have done the 
tame. I am Savant Tammon of 
the planet Mallidax — Llurdiaxorb 
Three — which is our destination. 
You, then, have had one or more 
successes in rotation? Our rotational 
tests all failed.” 

“We had only one success. As a 
Seeker I will be glad to give you 
the specifications of the structures, 
computers, and forces required for 
any possibility of success — which 
is very slight at best.” 

“This meeting is fortunate indeed. 
Have I your permission to come 
aboard your vessel, at such time as 
we approach each other nearly 
enough to make the fourth-dimen- 
sional transfer feasible?” 

“You certainly may, sir. Fll be 
very glad indeed to greet you in the 
flesh. And until that hour. Savant 
Tammon, so long and thanks.” 

S ince Mergon braked the MaU 
lidaxian down hard to help 
make the approach, and since the 
two vessels did not have to be close 
together even in astronomical terms, 
it was not long until Tammon stood 



facing DuQuesne m the Capital D's 
control room. 

The aged savant inhaled deeply, 
flexed his knees, and said, “As I 
expected, our environments are very 
similar. We greet new friends with 
a four-hand clasp. Is that form 
satisfactory?” 

“Perfectly; it’s very much like our 
own,” DuQuesne said; and four 
hands clasped briefly. 

“Would you like to come aboard 
our vessel now?” Tanmnon asked. 

“The sooner the better,” and they 
were both in Tammon’s laboratory, 
where Mergon and Luloy looked 
DuQuesne over with interest. 

“Seeker Sevance,” Tammon said 
then, “these are Savant Mergon, my 
first assistant, and Savant Luloy, 
his . well, ‘wife’ would be, I think, 
the closest possible English equiva- 
lent. You three are to become 
friends.” 

The hand-clasp was six-fold this 
time, and the two Jelmi said in 
unison. “I’m happy that we are to 
become friends.” 

“May our friendship ripen and 
deepen,” DuQuesne improvised the 
formula and bowed over the cluster 
of hands. 

“But Seeker,” Luloy said, as the 
cluster fell apart, “must all Seekers 
do their Seeking alone? I’d go stark 
raving mad if I had to be alone 
as long as you must have been.” 

“Ture Seekers, yes. While it is 
true that any normal man misses the 
companionship of his kind, espe- 
cially that of the opposite sex — ” 
DuQuesne gave Luloy a cool, con- 
tained smile as his glance traversed 
her superb figure — “even such a 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



115 




master of concent rar ion as a true 
Seeker must be can concentrate 
better, more productively, when ab- 
solutely alone.” 

Tammon nodded thoughtfully. 
“That nay well be true. Perhaps I 
shall try it 'myself. Now — we have 
some little time before dinner. Is 
there any other matter you would 
like to discuss?” 

For that question DuQuesne was 
well prepared. A Seeker, after all, 
needs something to be Sought; and 
as he did not want to appear ex- 
clusively interested in something 
which even the unsuspicious Jelmi 
would be aware was a weapon of 
war, he had selected another sub- 
ject about which to inquire. So he 
said at once: 

“A minor one, yes. While I am 
scarcely even a tyro in biology, I 
have pondered the matter of many 
hundreds — probably many millions 
— of apparently identical and quite 
possibly inter-fertile human races 
spaced so immensely far apart in 
space that any possibility of a 
common ancenstry is precluded.” 

“Ahl” Tammon’s eyes lit up. “One 
of my favorite subjects; one upon 
which I have done much work. We 
Jelmi and the Tellurians are very 
far apart indeed in space, yet cross- 
breeding is successful. In vitro, that 
is, and as far as I could carry the 
experimeqt. I can not synthesize a 
living placenta. No in vitro trial was 
made, since we of course could not 
abduct a Tellurian woman and not 
one of our young women cared to 
bear a child fathered by any Tel- 
lurian male we saw.” 

“From what I saw there I don’t 



blame them,” agreed DuQuesne. It 
was only the truth of his feelioga 
about Tellurians — with one impor- 
tant exception. “But doesn’t your 
success in vitro necessitate a com- 
mon ancestry?” 

“In a sense, yes; but not in the 
ordinary sense. It goes back to the 
unthinkably remote origin of all 
life. You can, I suppose, synthesize 
any non-living substance you please? 
Perfectly, down to what is appar- 
ently its ultimately fine structure?” 

“I see what .you mean.” DuQuesne, 
who had never thought really deeply 
about that fact, was hit hard. “Steak, 
for instance. Perfect in every respect 
except in that it never has been 
alive. No. We can synthesize DNA- 
RNA complexes, the building blocks 
of life, but they are not alive and 
we cannot bring them to life. And, 
conversely, we cannot dematerialize 
living flesh.” 

“Precisely. Life may be an extra- 
dimensional attribute. Its basis may 
lie in some ordei deeper than any 
now known. Whatever the truth may 
be, it seems to be known at present 
only to the omnipotence Who we of 
Mailidax call Llenderllon. All we 
know about life is that it is an 
immensely strong binding force and 
that its source — proximate, I mean, 
of course, not its ultimate origin — 
is the living spores that are drifting 
about in open space.” 

“Wait a minute,” DuQuesne said. 
“We had a theory like that long ago. 
So did Tellus — a scientist named 
Arrhenius — but all such theories 
were finally held to be untenable. 
Wishful thinking.” 

“I know. Less than one year ago, 

IF

I however, after twenty yean of 
' search. I found one such spare. Its 
. descendants have been living and 
I evolving ever since." 

D uQuesne’s jaw dropped. “You 
don’t say! That I want to see!" 
Tammon n^ded. “I have rigorous 
proof of authenticity. While it is 
entirely unlike any other form of 
life with which I am familiar, it is 
very interesting." 

“It would be, but there’s one other 
objection. What is the chance that 
on any two worlds humanity would 
have reached exactly the same stage 
of evolution at any given time?" 

“Ah! That is the crux of my 
theory, which I hope some day to 
prove; that when man’s brain be- 
comes large enough and compl«t 
enough to employ his hands effici- 
ently enough, the optimum form of 
life for that environment has been 
reached and evolution stops. Thence- 
forth all mutants and sports are un- 
able to compete with Homo Sapiens 
and do not survive.” 

DuQuesne thought for a long 
minute. Norlamin was very decided- 
ly not a Tellus-Type planet. “Some 
Xylmnians have it, ‘Man is the ul- 
timate creation of God.’ On Tellus 
it’s ‘God created man in his own 
image.’ And of course the fact that 
I’ve never believed it — and I still 
think it’s unjustifiable racial self- 
glorification — does not invalidate 
it.” 

“Of course it doesn’t. But to revert 
to the main topic, would you be 
willing to cooperate in an in vivo 
experiment?” 

DuQuesne smiled at that, then 



chuckled deeply. "I e^akily would, 
sir; and not for purely scientific 
reasons, either." 

“Oh, that would be no problem. 
Nor is your present quest — it will 
take only a short time to install the 
various mechanisms in your vessel 
and to instruct you in their us^. If 
my snap judgment is sound, how- 
ever, this other may very well be- 
come' of paramount importance and 
require a few days of time.” He 
touched a button on an intercom 
and said, “Senny." 

“Yes?” came in a deep contralto 
from the speaker. 

“Will you come in here pi ease? 
It concerns the in vivo experiment 
we have been discussing.” 

“Oh? Right away, Tamm,” and in 
about half a minute a young woman 
came striding in. 

DuQuesne stared, for she was a 
living shield-maiden — a veritable 
Valkyrie of flesh and blood. If she 
had had wings and if her pale 
blonde hair had been flying loose 
instead of being piled high on her 
head in thick, heavy braids, Du- 
Quesne thought, she could have 
stepped right out of Wagenhorst’s 
immortal painting Ragnarok. 

Tammon introduced them. “Seek- 
er Sevance of Xylmny, Savant Senn- 
lloy of Allondax, you two are to 
become friends.” 

“I’m happy that we are to become 
friends,” the girl said, in English, ex- 
tending her hands. DuQuesne took 
them, bowed over them, and said, 
“May our friendship ripen and deep- 
en. 

She examined him minutely, from 
the top of his head down to his 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



117 




toenails, in silence; then, turning to 
Tammon, she uttered a long sen- 
tence of which DuQuesne could not 
understand a word. 

“You should speak English, my 
dear,” Tammon said. “It is inurbane 
to exclude a guest from a conver- 
sation concerning him.” 

“It is twice as inurbane,” she 
countered in English, “to insult a 
guest, even by implication, who does 
not deserve it.” 

“That is true,” Tammon agreed, 
“but I have studied him to some 
little depth and it is virtually cer- 
tain that the matter lies in your 
province rather than mine. The 
decision is, of course, yours. Caps-on 
with him, please, and decide.” 

S he donned a helmet and handed 
its mate to DuQuesne. Ex- 
pecting a full-scale mental assault, 
he put up every block he had; but 
she did not think at him at all. 
Instead, she bored deep down into 
the most ab 3 rsmal recesses of his 
flesh; down and down and down 
to depths where he — expert though 
he was at synthesizing perfectly any 
tangible article of matter — could 
not follow. 

Eyes sparkling, she tossed both 
helmets onto a bench and seized 
both his hands in a grip very dif- 
ferent from the casual clasp she had 
used a few minutes before. “I am 
glad ~ very,' very glad, friend Seek- 
er Sevance, that we are friends!” 
Although DuQuesne was amazed 
at this remarkable change, he played 
up. He bowed over her hands and, 
this time, kissed each of them. “I 
thank you, Lady Sennlloy. My 



pleasure is immeasurable.” He smiled 
warmly and went on, “Since 1 am a 
stranger and thus ignorant of your 
conventions and in particular of 
your taboos, may I without offense 
request the pleasure of your com- 
pany at dinner? And my friends 
call me Vance.” 

She returned his smile as warmly. 
Neither of them was paying any 
attention at all to anyone else in 
the room. “And mine call me Senny. 
You may indeed, friend Vance, and 
I accept your invitation with joyous 
thanks. We go out that archway 
there and turn left.” 

They walked slowly toward the 
indicated exit; side by side and so 
close together that hip touched hip 
at almost every step. In the corridor, 
however, Sennlloy put her hand on 
DuQuesne’s arm and stopped. “But 
hold, friend Vance,” she said. “We 
should, don’t you think, make this, 
our first meal together, one of full 
formality?” 

“I do indeed. I would not have 
suggested it but I’m very much in 
favor of it.” 

“Splendid! We’ll go to my room 
first, then. This way,” and she 
steered him into and along a corridor 
whose blankly featureless walls were 
opaque instead of transparent. 

Was this his cue? DuQuesne won- 
dered. No, he decided. She wasn’t 
the type to rush things. She was 
civilized . more so than he was. 
If he didn’t play it just about right 
with this girl, who was very evidently 
a big wheel, she could and very 
probably would queer his whole 
deal. 

As they strolled along DuQuesne 

IF

MW that the walls were not quite 

featureless. At about head height, 
every twenty-five feet or so, there 
was inset a disk of optical plastic 
perhaps an inch in diameter. Stop- 
ping, and turning to face one of 
these disks, Senniloy pressed her 
right forefinger against it, explaining 
as she did so, “It opens to my 
fingerprints only.” 

There was an almost inaudible 
hiss of compressed air and a micro- 
mctrically fitted door — a good sev- 
en feet high and three feet wide 

moved an inch out into the hall and 
slid smoothly aside upon tracks that 
certainly had not been there an in- 
stant before. DuQuesne never did 
find out how the thing worked. He 
was too busy staring into the room 
and watching and hearing what the 
girl was doing and saying. 

She stepped back a half-step, 
bowed gracefully from the waist, 
and with a sweeping gesture of both 
hands invited him to precede her 
into the room. She started to say 
something in her own language — 
Allondaxian — but after a couple of 
words changed effortlessly to En- 
lish. “Friend Seeker Sevance, it is 
in earnest of our friendship that I 
welcome you into the privacy of my 
home” — and her manner made it 
perfectly clear that, while the 
phraseology was conventionally for- 
mal, in this case it was really meant. 

And DuQuesne felt it; felt it so 
strongly that he did not bluff or 
coin a responsive phrase. Instead: 
“Thank you. Lady Senniloy. We of 
Xylmny do not have anything com- 
parable, but I appreciate your wel- 
come and thank you immensely.” 



I nside the rocMn, DuQuesne stared. 

He had wondered what this 
girl’s private quarters would be 
like. She was a master scientist, true. 
But she was wannly human, not 
bookishly aloof. And what would 
seventy thousand years of evolution 
do to feminine vanity? Especially to 
a vanity that apparently had never 
been afflicted by false modesty? Or 
by any sexual taboos? 

The furniture — heavy, solid, 
plain, and built of what looked like 
golden oak — locked ordinary and 
utilitarian enough. Much of it was 
designed for, and was completely 
filled with and devoted to, the tools 
and equipment and tapes and scan- 
ners of the top-bracket biologist 
Senniloy of AUondax in fact was. The 
floor was of mathematically figured, 
vari-colored, plastic tile. The ceiling 
was one vast sheet of softly glowing 
white light. 

Three of the walls were ordinary 
enough. DuQuesne scarcely glanced 
at them because of the fourth, which 
was a single canvas eight feet high 
and over thirty feet long. One paint- 
ing. What a painting! A painting of 
life itself; a painting that seemed 
actually to writhe and to crawl and 
to vibrate with the very essence of 
life itself! 

One-celled life, striving fiercely 
upward in the primordial sea toward 
the light. Fiercely striving young 
fishes, walking determinedly ashore 
on their fins. Young about-to-be- 
come-mammals succeeding in their 
various climbings of evolution’s tre- 
mendous ladder. Striving young 
mammals developing tails and climb- 
ing up into trees — losing tails, with

of the trees — the ever-enlarging 
brain resulting in the appearance of 
true man. And finally, the develop- 
ment and the progress and the his- 
tory of man himself. 

And every being, from unicell to 
man, was striving with all its might 
upward; toward THE LIGHT. Up- 
ward! Upward!! UPWARD!!! 

At almost the end of that heart- 
stopping painting there was a por- 
trait of Sennlloy herself in the arms 
of a man; a yellow-haired, smooth- 
shaven Hercules so fantastically 
well-drawn, so incredibly alive- 
seeming. that DuQuesne stared in 
awe. 

Beyond those two climactic fig- 
ures the painting became a pure 
abstract of form and of line and 
color; an abstract, however, that 
was crammed full of invisible but 
very apparent question marks. It 
asked — more, it demanded and it 
yelled — **What is coming nextT' 

D uQuesne, who had been holding 
his breath, let it out and 
breathed deeply. “And you painted 
that yourself,” he marveled. “Milady 
Sennlloy, if you never do anything 
else as long as you live, you will 
have achieved immortality.” 

She blushed to the breasts. 
“Thanks, friend Vance. I’m very 
glad you’ like it: I was sure you 
would.” 

“It’s so terrific that words fail,’' 
he said, and meant. Then, nodding 
at the portrait, he went on, “Your 
husband?” 

She shook her head. “Not yet. He 



has not the genes the Lluidi wish 
to propagate, so we could not marry 
and he had to stay on Allondax 
instead of becoming one of this 
group. But he and I love each other 
more than life. When we Jelmi .a- 
board this Mallidaxian have taught 
those accursed Llurdi their lesson, 
we will marry and we’ll never be 
parted again. But time presses, 
friend Vance; we must consider our 
formalities.” 

Walking around the foot of her 
bed — the satin covejlet of which 
bore, in red and gold, a motif that 
almost made even DuQuesne blush 
— she went to a bureau-like piece 
of furniture and began to pull open 
its bottom drawer. Then, changing 
her mind, she closed it sharply; but 
not before the man got a glimpse 
of its contents that made him catch 
his breath. That drawer contained 
at least two bushels of the most 
fantastic jewelry EhiQuesne had ever 
seen! 

Shaking her head, Sennlloy went 
on, “No. My formality should not 
influence yours. The fact that you 
appreciate and employ formality 
implies, does it not, that you do not 
materialize and dematerialize its ma- 
terial symbols, but cherish them?” 

“Yes; you and I think very much 
alike on that,” DuQuesne agreed. He 
was still feeling his way. This hadn*t 
been a cue; that was now abundantly 
certain. In fact, with Sennlloy so 
deeply in love with one man, she 
probably wouldn’t be in the business 
herself at all ... or would she? Were 
these people advanced enough — if 
you could call it advancement — 
different enough, anyway — to re- 



120 



IF 




gard sex-for-love and sex-for-kn- 
provement-of-race as two entirely 
different matters; so completely un- 
related as not to affect each other? 
He simply didn’t know. Data insuf- 
ficient. However the thing was to 
go, he’d played along so far; he’d 
still play along. Wherefore, without 
any noticeable pause, he went on: 
“I intended to comply with your 
conventions, but I’ll be glad to use 
my own if you prefer. So I’ll ask 
Tammon to flip me over to my own 
ship to put oli^^my high-formal gear.” 
“Oh, no; I’ll do it” Donning the 
helmet that had been lying on the 
beautifully grained oak-like top of 
the bureau, she took his left hand 
and compared his wristwatch briefly 
with the timepiece on the wall. “I’ll 
bring you back here in . in how 
many of your minutes?” 

“Ten minutes will be time 
enough.” 

“In exactly ten minutes from — ” 
She waited until the sweep hand of 
his watch was exactly at the dot of 
twelve o’clock. “Mark,” she said 
Aen, and DuQuesne found himself 
standing in his own private cabin 
aboard the Capital D. 

H e picked up shaving cream aiKl 
brush; then, asking aloud, 
“How stupid can you get, fool?” he 
tossed them back onto the shelf, put 
on his helmet, and thought his 
whiskers off flush with the surface 
of his skin. Then, partly from habit 
but mostly by design — its riddy 
masculine, heady scent was supposed 
to “wow the women” — he rubbed 
on a couple of squirts of after-shave 
lotion. 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 




Opening closet doors, he looked 
at the just-nicely-broken-in trap- 
pings he had made such a short time 
before. How should he do it, jeweled 
or plain? She was going to be 
gussied up like a Christmas tree, so 
he’d better go plain. Showy, plenty; 
but no jewels. And, judging by that 
spectacular coverlet and other items 
in her room, she liked fire-engine 
red and gold. Okay. 

Taking off his watch and donning 
one exactly like it except for the 
fact that it kept purely imaginary 
Xylmnian time — that had been a 
slip; if she’d noticed it, she’d have 
wondered why he was running on 
Tellurian time — he dressed himself 
in full panoply of Xylmnian finery 
and examined himself carefully in a 
full-length mirror. 

He now wore a winged and crest- 
ed headpiece of interlaced platinum 
strips; the front of the crest ridging 
up into a three-inch platinum disk 
emblazoned with an intricate heral- 
dic design in deeply inlaid massive 
gold. A heavy collar, two arm- 
bands, and two wristlets, all made 
of woven and braided platinum 
strands, each bore the same symbolic 
disk. He wore a sleeveless shirt and 
legless shorts of gleaming, glaringly- 
red silk, with knee-length hose to 
match — and red-leather-lined bus- 
kins of solid-gold chain mail. And 
lastly, a crossed-strap belt, also of 
massive but’ supple gold link, with 
three platinum comets on each 
shoulder, supported a solid-platinum 
scabbard containing an extremely 
practical knife. 

He drew the blade. Basket-hilted 
and with fifteen inches of heavy, 



wickedly curved, peculiarly shaped, 
razor - edged and needle - pointed 
stainless-steel blade, it was in fact 
an atrocious weapon indeed — and 
completely unlike any item of formal 
dress that DuQuesne had ever heard 
of. 

All this had taken nine and one 
half minutes by his watch — by his 
Earth-watch, lying now upon his 
dresser. The time was now zero 
minus exactly twenty-eight seconds. 

XIV 

Seeker Sevance of Xylmny 

P recisely on the tick of time Du- 
Quesne stood again in Senn- 
lloy’s room. He glanced at her; then 
stood flat-footed and simply goggled. 
He had expected a display, but this 
was something that had to be seen 
to be believed — and then but bare- 
ly. She was literally ablaze with 
every kind of gem he had ever seen 
and a dozen kinds completely new 
to him. Just as she stood, she could 
have supplied Tiffany and Cartier 
both for five years. 

Yet she did not look barbaric. 
Blue-eyed, with an incredible cas- 
cade of pale blonde hair cut squarely 
across well below her hips, she look- 
ed both regal and virginal. 

“Wow!” he exclaimed finally. 
“The English has — not a word for 
it, but a sound,” and he executed a 
long-drawn-out wolf-whistle. 

She laughed delightedly. “Oh? I 
did not hear that on Tellus; but it 
sounds . appreciative.” 

“It is. Milady. Very.” He took her 
hands and bowed over them. “May 



122 



IF 




I say, Lady Senny, that you are the 
most beautiful woman 1 have ever 
seen?” 

“‘Milady.’ ‘Lady.* I have not told 
you how much I like those terms, 
friend Vance. I’m wonderfully 
pleased that you find me so. You’re 
magnificently handsome yourself 
. and you smell nice, too.” She 
came squarely up to him and sniffed 
approvingly. “But the . the blade 
of formality. May I look at it, 
please?” 

She examined it closely, then went 
on, “Tell me, Vance, how old is 
your recorded history? Just roughly, 
m Tellurian years?” 

This could be a crucial question, 
DuQuesne realized; but, since he 
didn’t know the score yet, he hadn’t 
better lie too much. “Before I answer 
that; you’re a biologist, aren’t you, 
and in the top bracket?” 

“Yes. In English it would have to 
be ‘anthropological biologist’ and 
yes, I know my specialty very well.” 

“Okay. For better or for worse, 
here it is. Xylmny’s recorded history 
goes back a little over six thousand 
Tellurian years.” 

“Oh, wonderful!” she breathed. 
“Perfect! That’s what I read, but I 
could scarcely believe it. A young 
race. Mature, but still possessing the 
fire and the power and the genius 
that those accursed Llurdi have been 
breeding out of all us Jelmi for many 
thousands of years. They want us to 
produce geniuses for them, but they 
kill or sterilize all our aggressive, 
combative, rebellious young men. A 
few of us women carry all the 
necessary female genes, but without 
their male complements, dominant 



in heredky, we all might exactly at 
well have none of them.” 

“I see . but how about Tam- 
mon?” 

“He’s sterile, since he was a genius 
before he became a rebel. And ho 
kept on being a genius; one of the 
very few exceptions to the rule. But 
since the Llurdi are insanely logical, 
one exception to any rule invalidates 
that rule.” She glanced at the clock. 
“It’s time to go now.” 

Walking slowly along the corridor, 
DuQuesne said, “ ‘Insanely logical’ is 
right. I knew that there was a lot 
more to this than just an experiment, 
but I had no idea it was to put new 
and younger blood into an entire 
race. But with mothers such as you 
have in mind — ” 

“Mothers?” She broke in. “You al- 
ready know, then?” 

“Of course. I am sufficiently fa^- 
miliar with your specialty to know 
what a top-bracket biologist can do 
and how you intend to do it. With 
mothers of your class some of our 
sons may make genius grade, but 
what’s to keep them alive?” 

“We will.” Sennlloy’s voice and 
mien became of a sudden grim. 
“This fourth-dimension device that 
Tammon is going to give you was 
developed only a few weeks ago, 
since we left Llurdiax. The Llurdi 
know nothing whatever of it. When 
we get back to our own galaxy with 
it, either the Llurdi wfll grant us our 
full freedom or we will kill every 
Llurdi alive. And* being insanely 
logical, they’ll grant it without a 
fight: without even an argument, 
Sancil bum their teeth, wings, and 
tails!”

D uQuesne did not tdl tbe gW 
how interested he was m ibc 
LIurdi; especiafly in Llanzlan Klaz- 
mon the Fifteenth. Instead, **Tliat 
makes a weird kind of sense, at that,” 
he said. “Tell me more about these 
LIurdi,” and she told him about 
them all the rest of the way to the 
dining hall. 

They went through an archway, 
stepped aside, and looked around. 
Three or four hundred people were 
in the hall already, and more were 
streaming in from all sides. Some 
were eating, in oon^les or in groups 
of various mimlbers, at tables of 
various sizes. Dress varied from 
nothing at all op to several spec- 
taculars as flamhoyant as Sennlloy’s 
own. Infonnal, semi-formal, and 
formal; and the people themselves 
were alike in orfy one respect — 
that of physical perfection. Du- 
Quesne had never seen anything like 
it and said so; and Sennlloy ex- 
plained, conchicfiog: 

“So, you see, we eight hundred 
are the v^ pick of two hundred 
forty-one planetr, which makes this 
an ideal primary situation. The 
reason I wanted you to look around 
carefully is that perhaps I should not 
be the only Prime Operative.” She 
paused: it was quke evident that she 
was not at all in favor of the idea. 

“Why not?” DuQuesne wasn’t in 
favor of it, either; even though he 
couldn’t begin to understand cither 
her attitude or her behavior. How 
could any woman possibly be as 
deeply in love with one man as 
Sennlloy very cvidentiy was, and yet 
act as she was acting toward such 
a complete stranger as himsdf? It 



baffled him completely, but he’d 
still play along — especially since he 
was si^ering no pain at all. “It 
won’t make any difference in the 
long run, will it?” 

“Of course not. I just thought 
maybe you would relish diversity,” 
Seiinlloy said. 

“You can unthink it. I wouldn’t. 
There’s no tomcat blood in me — 
and remember what I said?” 

“Do you think I don’t? But you’ve 
seen some really beautiful women 
now. Mudh prettier than I am.” 

“You know what they call that 
technique in English? ‘Fishing’,” 
grinned DuQuesne. “Prettier or 
not, Milady, you top them all by a 
country mile.” 

'*1 Imow about fishing. I was fish- 
ing a little, perhaps.” She laughed 
happily and hugged hk arm against 
her breast. “But it did get you 
to say it again, and it means ever 
so much nK>re, now that you’ve seen 
the competition.” 

She steered him to a table for two 
against a waB, where he seated her 
meticulously — a gesture that, while 
evidently new to her, was evidently 
liked. 

“You order,” she said handing 
him the hrimet **You invited me, 
you know.” 

“But I don’t know what you like 
to eat.” 

“Oh, I like almost everything, 
really; and if there should be any- 
thing I don’t like I won’t eat it. 
Okay?” 

“Okay,” and DuQuesne proceeded 
to set die taWe widi fine linen and 
translucent china and sterling silver 
and sparkling cut glass.

IF 




T he first coarse was a thin, dear 

soup; which Sennlloy liked. 
She also liked the crisp lettuce with 
Roquefort dressing; the medium rare 
roast beef with mushroom sauce and 
the asparagus in butter and the 
baked Idaho potato stuffed with 
sour cream; and she especially en- 
joyed the fruits-and-nuts-filled Nes- 
selrode ice cream. She did not, how- 
ever- like his corrosively strong, 
black, unsweetened coffee at all. 
Wrinkling her nose, she sniffed at 
it, then took a tiny sip, which she 
let flow back into the cup. 

“How can you possibly drink such 
vile stuff as that?” she demanded, 
and replaced it with a tall glass of 
fizzy, viscous concoction that looked 
like eggnog and reeked of something 
that was halfway between almond 
and lemon. 

After dinner — DuQuesne want- 
ed to smoke, but since no one else 
was doing anything of the kind he 
could and would get along without 
it as long as he was aboard the 
Mallidaxian — they milled about 
with the milling throng. She intro- 
duced him right and left and showed 
him off generally; especially to over 
a hundred stunning young women, 
with whom she discussed the “pro- 
ject” in American English with a 
completely uninhibited frankness 
that made DuQuesne blush more 
than once. 

After something over an hour of 
this the crowd broke up; and as the 
two left the hall Sennlloy said, “Hal 
We’re free now, my Vance, to go 
about our business!” 

Arms tightly around each other, 
savoring each contact and each 



motion, they walked slowly and in 
silence to ^nnlloy’s room. 

T hree Mallidaxian days later, 
DuQuesne took his leave. Of 
Sennlloy last, of course. She put her 
arms around him and rubbed her 
cheek against his. “Good-by, friend 
Vance. I have joyed our associa- 
tion tremendously. Scarcely ever be- 
fore has work been such pleasure. 
So much so that I feel guilty of 
selfishness.” 

“You needn’t. Milady. That was 
exactly the way I wanted it, remem- 
ber?” 

“I remember with joy; and I have 
wondered why.” 

“Because you are the only one of 
your class aboard this ship,” Du- 
Quesne said. 

“You said that, but still — well, 
I am the only Allondaxian aboard, 
which may account for our great 
compatibility. And there should be, 
as there has been, something more 
than the purely physical involved.” 
DuQuesne was very glad she had 
said that; it gave him one last chance 
to explore. “Definitely,” he agreed. 
“Liking, respvect, appreciation, admi- 
ration — you’re a tremendous lot of 
woman. Milady Sennlloy. But not 
love. Naturally.” 

“Of course not. 1 have my love 
and my work and my planet; you 
have yours; it would be terrible for 
either of us or any of ours to be 
hurt. 

“Our rememberings of each other 
should be and will be most pleasant. 
Good-by, friend Vance; may AU 
Powerful Llenderllon guard you and 
aid you as you Seek.”

XV 

DuQuesne’s Assassins 

N ot even Marc DuQuesne was 
able — quite! — to put his 
rather astonishing, and totally plea- 
surable, experiences with the Jelmi 
— and with one Jelm in particular! 
— out of his mind without a second’s 
hesitation. In another man, his mood 
as he set a minimum-time course and 
began to speed back to Earth, might 
have been called nostalgic . even 
sentimental. 

But as the parsecs fled by his 
thoughts hardened. And just in time; 
for some very hard things indeed 
had to be done. 

First and foremost, his deal with 
Seaton was utterly, irrevocably and 
permanently off. He no longer need- 
ed it. With the information he had 
received from the Jelmi, he had no 
further reason to worry about Sea- 
ton’s offensive capabilities. 

Of course, there was no reason 
for Seaton to know that. Or not 
until it was entirely too late to do 
Seaton any good. Let Seaton go on 
dawdling toward this Galaxy DW- 
427-LU. Seaton would be traveling 
at only normal max; DuQuesne 
would have time to make his ar- 
rangements, transact his business 
and act while Seaton was still on 
the way. 

He did not intend to go to Earth, 
only to within working distance of 
it. Eveu so, he had a certain amount 
of time to spend He spent k, all 
of it, in studying and operating the 
new device, whidi was called by the 
Jcim a mune winch SennSoy had 

126 



told him corresponded roughly to 
“quad”. 

And immediately he ran headlong 
into trouble. 

To DuQuesne’s keen disappoint- 
ment, the confounded thing was both 
more and less useful than he had 
hoped. More: Its range was enor- 
mous, much more than he had ex- 
pected. Less: — well, it simply didn’t 
do any of the normal things that 
any machine could be made to do. 
And he could not tell why. He had 
received too much knowledge too 
fast; it took time to nail down all 
the details. 

He could send himself anywhere, 
but he could not bring himself 
back. He had to be at the controls. 
Remote control wouldn’t work and 
he couldn’t find out why not. The 
thing — in its present state of devel- 
opment, at least — couldn’t handle 
a working projection; and he could- 
n’t explain that fact, cither. There 
was no way at all, apparently, of 
coupling the two transmitters to- 
gether or of automating the controls 
— which was absurd on the face of 
it. There were job lots of things it 
couldn’t do; and in no case at all 
could he imderstand why not. 

That condition was, however, 
perfectly natural. In fact, it was 
inevitable. For, as has been pointed 
out, the laws of the fourth-dimen- 
sional region are completely inex- 
plicable in three-dimensional terms. 
Obvious impossibilities become com- 
monplace events; many things that 
are incvkable in our ordinary con- 
timium become starkly impossible 
there. 

Twmmon had told DuQuesne just 

IF 




that; Seaton had told him the same, 
and much more strongly for having 
been there in person; but DuQuesne 
could not help but boggle at such 
information. Of the three men, he 
was far and away the least able to 
accept an obvious impossibility as a 
fact and go on from there. 

So Blackie DuQuesne, his face 
like a steel-black thundercloud, me- 
thodically and untiringly worked 
with his new device until he was 
quite sure that of all the things he 
could make it do, he could make it 
do all of them very well. 

And that would be enough. Never 
mind the things it wouldn’t do. What 
it would do would be plenty to get 
rid of Richard Ballinger Seaton once 
and for all. 

W ithin range of Earth at last, 
DuQuesne set about the first 
step in that program. 

The simplest and crudest methods 
would work — backed by the weird 
fourth-dimensional powers of the 
quad. And DuQuesne knew exactly 
how about recruiting the assistance 
he needed in those methods. 

He launched a working projection 
of himself to the Safe Deposit De- 
partment of the First National 
Bank. He signed a name and counted 
out a sheaf of currency from a box. 
He then took a taxi to the World 
Steel Bulding and an elevator up 
to the office of the President. 

Brushing aside private secretaries, 
vice presidents, and other small fry, 
he strode through a succession of 
private offices into the sanctum 
sanctorum of President Brookings 
himself. 



The tycoon was, as usual, alone. 
If he was surprised at the intrusion 
he did not show it. He took the big 
cigar from his mouth, little-fingered 
half an inch of ash from the end 
of it into a bronze tray, put it back 
between his teeth, and waited. 

‘‘Still thinking your usual devious, 
petty-larceny, half-vast thoughts, eh, 
Brookings?” DuQuesne sneered. 

“I didn’t think that even you. 
Doctor, would have the sublime gall 
to show up around here again,’* 
Brookings said, evenly. “Even via 
projection, after the raw stuff you 
pulled and the ungodly flop you 
made of everything. Especially after 
the way your pal Seaton dragged 
you out of here with your tail be- 
tween your legs. Incidently, it 
took everything you had coming to 
repair the damage you did to the 
building on your way out.” 

“Stupid as ever, I see. And the 
galaxy’s tightest penny-pincher. But 
back pay and the law of contracts 
and so forth are of no importance 
at the moment. What I’m here about 
is: with all these Norlaminian so- 
called ‘observers’ looking down the 
back of your neck all the time, 
Perkins’ successor and his goon 
squads must be eating mighty low 
on the hog.” 

“We haven’t any — ” At Du- 
Quesne’s sardonically contemptuous 
smile Brookings changed instantly 
the sense of what he had been 
going to say — “work for them, to 
speak of, at that. Why?” 

“So six of your best and fastest 
gunnies would be interested in ten 
grand apiece for a month’s loaf and 
a minute’s work.” 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE

“Don*t say mine. Doctor. Pleasel 
You know very well that I never 
have anything to do with anything 
like that.” 

“No? But you know who took 
over the Perkins Cafe and the top- 
mobster job after I killed Perkins. 
So 1 want six off the top downstairs 
in the lobby at sixteen hours Eastern 
Daylight time today.” 

“You know I never handle — ” 
“Shut up! I’m not asking you — 
I’m telling you. You’ll handle this, 
or else.” 

Brookings shrugged his shoulders 
and sighed. He knew DuQuesne. 
“If you want good men they’ll have 
to know what the job is.” 

“Naturally. Dick and Dorothy 
Seaton, Martin and Margaret Crane, 
and their Jap Shiro and his wife — 
Apple Blossom or whatever her 
name is. Seaton’s fast, for an ama- 
teur, but he’s no pro. Crane is slow 
— he thinks and aims. And the 
others dcm’t count. I’ll guarantee 
complete surprise enough for one 
clear shot at Seaton. Anybody who 
is apt to need two shots I don’t 
want. So — no problem.” 

“I’ll see what I can do.” 

Since DuQuesne knew that was 
as close as Brookings ever came to 
saying “yes”, he accepted it. “In 
advance, of course.” Brookings held 
out his hand. 

“Naturally.” DuQuesne took a 
rubber-band^ sheaf of thousand- 
dollar bills out of his inside coat 
pocket and tossed it across the desk. 
“Count ‘em.” 

“Naturally.” Brookings picked the 
sheaf up and riffled throug}i k. 
“Correct. Good-by, Doctor.” 



“Good-by,” DuQuesne said, and 
the projection vanished. 

A t four o’clock that afternoon 
DuQuesne picked up his goons 
— through the fourth dimension, 
which surprised them tremendously 
and scared them no little, although 
none of them would admit that 
fact — and headed for the galaxy 
toward which the Skylark of Valeron 
had been flying so long. The Capitd 
D was of course much faster than 
the gigantic planetoid; and the actual 
difference inspeed between the two 
intergalactic flyers was much greater 
than the rat^ one because Du- 
Quesne was driving with all his 
engines at absolute max — risking 
burn-out, tear-out, and unavoidable 
collision at or near the frightful 
velocity of turnover — which Seaton 
of course was not doing. He didn’t 
want to endanger the Valeron, 

In the target galaxy — Galaxy 
DW-427-LU, according to Klaz- 
mon’s chart — there was only one 
solar system showing really intense 
sixth-order activity. Almost all of 
that activity would be occurring on 
one planet; a planet whose inhabi- 
tants were highly inimical to (prob- 
ably) all other forms of intelligent 
life. 

Klazmon’s side-bands of thought 
had been very informative on those 
points. 

Thus it was by neither accident 
nor coincidence that DuQuesne 
came up to within long working 
range of the Skylark of Valeron well 
before that flying worldlet came 
within what DuQuesne thought was 
extreme range of a planet that Du- 



128 



IP 




Queme knew to be a ¥ery dangerous 
planet indeed. 

He had wanted it that way; he 
had risked his ship and his life to 
make it come out that way. When 
the Valeron came within range of 
the target planet she would be Du- 
Quesne’s not Seaton’s. And Du- 
Quesne was calmly confident that he 
and a Valeron re-tuned to his own 
mind could cope with any possible 
situation. 

As a matter of fact, they couldn’t. 
It was not, however, DuQuesne’s 
error or fault that made it so; it 
was merely the way Fate’s mop 
flopped. Neither he nor Seaton had 
any idea whatever of the appalling 
magnitude of the forces so soon to 
be hurled against Seaton’s supposedly 
invulnerable flying fortress, the Sky- 
lark of Valeron, 

Operating strictly according to 
plan, then, DuQuesne called his 
goons to attention. “You’ve been 
briefed and you’ve had plenty of 
practise, but I’ll recap the essential 
points. 

“Guns in hands. They’ll be eating 
dinner, with their legs under the 
table. Sitting ducks for one shot. But 
for one shot only. Especially Seaton 
— for an amateur he’s fast. So work 
fast — land and shoot. I’ll give you 
the usual three-second countdown, 
beginning, now — Seconds! Three! 
Two! One! Mark!” and the six men 
vanished. 

A nd in the dining room of the 
Seaton’s home in the Skylark 
of Valeron six forty-five-caliber au- 
tomatics barked viciously, practi- 
cally as one.

The CMorans 

W hile imich work had been done 
on a personal gravity control, 
to provide for the comfort of suck 
visitors as Dunark and Sitar, it .was 
still in the design stage when the 
Skylark of Valeron neared Galaxy 
DW-427-LU. Wherefore, when the 
Skylarkers sat down to dinner that 
evening in the Seaton’s dining room* 
that room was almost forty per cent 
undergrav. And wherefore, when 
DuQuesne’s six hired killers fired 
practically as one, all six bullets went 
harmlessly high. 

For, at low gravity, two facts of 
marksmanship — unknown to or not 
considered by either DuQuesne or 
any of his men — became dominant. 
First, a pistol expert compensates 
automatically for the weight of his 
weapon. Second, the more expert 
the marksman, the more automatie 
this compensation is. 

And one shot each was all those 
would-be killers had. Dunark and 
Sitar as has been said, went armed 
even to bed; and Osnomian reflexes 
were and are the fastest possessed 
by any known race of man. Each 
of their machine pistols clicked 
twice and four American hoodlums 
died, liquescent brains and com- 
minuted Skulls spattering abroad, be- 
fore they could do anything mors 
than begin to bring their guns bad^ 
down into line for their second shots. 

The other two gangsters also died; 
if not as quickly or as messily, just 
as dead. For Shiro and his bride 
were, for Earthmen, very fast in-

deed Their chairs, too, flew away 
from the table the merest instant 
after the invaders appeared* and 
both took off in low, flat dives. 

Lotus struck her man with her 
left shoulder; and, using flawlessly 
the momentum of her mass and 
speed, swung him around and put 
her small but very hard knee exactly 
where it would do the most good. 
Then, as he doubled over in agony, 
she put her left arm around his head, 
seized her left wrist with her right 
hand, and twisted with all the 
strength of arms, shoulders, torso 
and legs — and the man’s neck 
broke with a snap audible through- 
out the room. 

And Shiro took care of his man 
with equal dexterity, precision, and 
speed; and of the invaders, then 
there were none. 

Seaton was a mi<^osecond slower 
than either the Osnomians or the 
two Japanese; but he was fast 
enough to see what was happening, 
take in the fact that the forces 
already engaged were enough to 
handle the six hoodlums and, in mid- 
flight, divert his leap toward the 
remote-control headset. He was 
blindingly certain of one thing: It 
was Marc DuQuesne who had un- 
leashed these killers on them. And 



he was equally certain of that fact’s 
consequence: The truce was off. 
DuQuesne was to be destroyed. 

Wherefore what happened next 
astonished him even more than if it 
had occurred at another time. 

A strident roar of klaxons filled 
the room. It was the loudest sound 
any human had ever heard — with- 
out permanent damage; it was cal- 
culated to come right up to the 
threshold of destruction. There was 
to be no chance that anyone would 
fail to hear this particular signal. 

His hand on the headset, Seaton 
paused. The bodies of the six gun- 
men had not yet all reached the 
floor, but the other Skylarkers were 
staring too. They had never expected 
to hear that sound except in test. 

It was the dire warning that they 
were under attack — massive attack 
— attack on a scale and of a per- 
sistence that they had never expected 
to encounter in real combat, with 
whatever forces. 

For that klaxon warning meant 
that under the fierce impact of the 
enemy weapons now so suddenly 
and mercilessly beating down on 
them* the life of the Valeron’s de- 
fensive screens was to be measured 
only in seconds — and very few of 
them!
