GROWHt PAMS -AND PlEASIRES 



T here was a time when we 
thought we would get Skylark 
DuQuesne into three installments. 
Doc Smith, though, is a man who 
thinks on a huge scale. Kiloparsecs 
are only short jaunts for the Sky- 
larkers, and kilowords are just 
enough room to get started in for 
the stories of their adventures. We 
gave up the three-installment idea 
early. 

Then we were pretty sure weM be 
able to do it in four. But other 
stories kept coming in. A long one 
by Van Vogt and Schmitz that 
we wanted to bring you right away; 
shorter ones by a half dozen other 
writers; the regular features . 
anyway, we found ourselves out of 
room. So this third installment of 
Skylark DuQuesne isn^t the last. 
Neither is next month’s fourth in- 
stallment. It will take five in all, 
eoncluding in our October issue. 
(Positively!) 

This was frankly a little embar- 
rassing to us, and it caused us to do 
a lot of thinking and reappraising 
of some things we had been taking 
for granted about our production 
procedures. In fact, it started in 
train a pretty complex series of 
events . but, we think you will 
agree, one with a happy ending. 

You see, when you come right 
down to it, a hundred and thirty-two 
pages isn’t really enough space for 
a magazine like If, 

We do what we can, of course. 
We managed to get more words into 



If than you’ll find in nearly any 
other magazine of its size — by using 
a more compact type, by running 
very little advertising matter, by 
a variety of stratagems. Still and 
all, we’ve always felt a little 
cramped. 

This has made an editorial prob- 
lem that we’ve never been quite con- 
fident of solving. It’s a classic di- 
lemma. On the one hand, we think 
a magazine should have a variety 
of stories in it — and you can’t have 
a variety unless you print at least 
half a dozen stories, preferably 
more than that. On the other hand 
it seems to be the nature of the 
beast tnat the longer sf stories are 
usually more fun to read than the 
short ones. (Oh, sure, there are 
honorable exceptions. But just for 
fun, make your own list of the 
twenty best science-fiction stories 
you’ve ever read. See how many run 
novelette length or longer.) 

This problem has been with us 
for years — relieved a little bit when 
we changed format, because the new 
type meant a little extra wordage; 
relieved again when we went month- 
ly, because that made it easier to 
use serials — but still a problem. 

However, we think we’ve licked it 
now. 

Starting next month, there will 
be thirty-two more pages in If, 
Enough to run about two extra 
novelettes — or four or five short 
stories — or . an additional complete 
short novel — or an extra installment

«Kf a serial. That is in addition to 
what weVe been running all along, 
of course — so that if a typical issue 
has contained six or seven stories, 
about half of them novelettes or 
serial installments or other long 
pieces, the issue from now on will 
contain all of those things plus what 
we can get into the thirty- two extra 
pages. One of the minor side-effects, 
for instance, will probably- be that 
Hue & Cry will show up in every 
issue, instead of being squeezed out 
from time to time when the story 
pressure gets too heavy. But the 
principal effect will be that we will 
have room to give you more stories 
in each issue — which we think will 
mean a better balance of stories. 

Now, this is all stop-press news, 
as this editorial is written. In fact, 
the decision was made just 48 hours 
ago, and we spent all day yesterday 
redesigning our September cover, 
titles and so on to make it all pos- 
sible. (Onee the publisher gave us 
the go-ahead we didn’t want to 
waste any time putting it into ef- 
fect!) Some thing^s we didn't have 
time to do. For example, for one 
reason and another it was impos- 
sible to reschedule Doc Smith's 
Skylark any more, so it will still 
run to five parts, concluding in Oc- 
tober. But we did have time to send 
out a Qouple of additional novelettes 
— stories that you would have had 
to wait at least another month for 
otherwise; and probably, for make- 
up reasons, considerably longer than 
that. 

And, oh, yes, one thing more. 

The more case-hardened and fre- 
quently shot-over among our read- 
ers are already rattling coins in 
their pockets, thinking grim 
thoughts about inflation and rising 



prices, and wondering just what all 
this is leading up to. Increasing the 
price to a dollar a copy, maybe? 

Matter of fact, we aren't increas- 
ing it at all. 32 more pages . 
which means adding 26% to the body 
of the magazine and actually some- 
what more than that to its story 
contents . and the price stays 
right where it is. 

Now, there*s a fantastic story for 
you! 

But it's true. Pick up a copy next 
month and see for yourself. 

I ncidentally, filling the new big- 
ger If will mean we'll have to be 
buying a couple hundred thousand 
extra words every year, so this is 
as good a time as any to mention 
again that we are permanently on 
the lookout for good new stories and 
good new writers. As you old-timers 
know, for several years now we 
have been publishing at least one 
‘‘First” story in each issue — ^by a 
writer never previously published. 
It isn't a contest. The stories are 
bought at our regular rates, and 
we're perfectly willing to publish 
more than one an issue if we get 
enough good ones. The only “rules” 
are those that apply to writing stor- 
ies for any magazine anywhere: 
Stories must be original; they must 
be typed, double-spaced on white 
paper; they must come with 
stamped, self-addressed return en- 
velope . and they must be good 
enough to publish! (All you have to 
worry about is competing with Rob- 
ert A. Heinlein, A. E. Van Vogt, 
Hal Clement, Keith Laumer, Poul 
Anderson, Edward E. Smith, Fritz 
Leiber and a few others like that. 
But — after all, that's exactly how 
they started too) —THE EDITOR

The conquering Krultch had little to fear 
from Retief's outcast band of mountebanks 
— so, fearlessly, they lost their empire! 



7 



A large green-yolked egg splat- 
tered across the flexglas panel 
as it slammed behind Relief. Across 
the long, narrow lobby, under 
a glare-sign reading HOSTELRY 
RITZ-KRUDLU, the Gaspierre 
room clerk looked up, then came 
quickly around the counter, long- 
^died, short-legged, an expression 
as of one detecting a bad odor on 
his flattened, leathery-looking face. 
He spread six of the eight arms 
attached to his narrow shoulders like 
a set of measuring spoons, twitching 
the other two in a cramped shrug. 

“The hotel, he is fill!” he wheezed. 
“To some other house you convey 
your custom, yes?” 

“Stand fast,” Relief said to the 
foqr Terrans who had preceded him 
through the door. “Hello, Strupp,” 
he nodded to the agitated clerk. 
“These are friends of mine. See if 
you can’t find them a room.” 

“As I comment but now, the 
rooms, he is occupy!” Strupp 
pointed to the door, “Kindly facili- 
ties provide by management to 
place selves back outside use!” 

A narrow panel behind the regis- 
tration desk popped open; a second 
Gaspierre slid tlu-ough, took in the 
situation, emitted a sharp hiss. 
Strupp whirled, his arms semaphor- 
ing an unreadable message. 

“Never mind that, Strupp,” the 
newcomer snapped in accentless 
Terran. He took out a strip of 
patterned cloth, mopped under the 
breathing orifices set in the sides 
of his neck, looked at the group 
of Terrans, and then back at Relief. 
“Ah, something I can do for you, 
Mr. Relief?” 



“Evening, Hrooze,” Relief said. 
“Permit me to introduce Mr. Julius 
Mulvihill, Miss Suzette La Flamme, 
Wee Willie and Professor Fate, 
just in from cut-system. There seems 
to be a room shortage in town. I 
thought perhaps you could accom- 
modate them.” 

H rooze eyed the door through 
which the Terrans had enter- 
ed, twitched his nictating eyelids in 
a nervous gesture. 

“You know the situation here. 
Relief!” he said. “I have nothing 
against Terries personally, of course, 
but if I rent to these people — ” 

“I was thinking you might fix 
them up with free rooms, just as a 
sort of good-will gesture.” 

“If we these Terries to the Ritz- 
Krudlu admit, the repercussions 
political out of business us will put!” 
Strupp expostulated. 

“The next ship out is two days 
from now,” Relief said. “They need 
a place to stay until then.” 

Hrooze looked at Relief, mopped 
his neck again. “I owe you a favor, 
Relief,” he said. “Two days, though, 
that’s all!” 

“But — ” Strupp began. 
“Silence!” Hrooze sneezed. “Put 
them in twelve-oh-three and four!’^ 
He drew Relief aside as a small 
bell-hop in a brass-studded harness 
began loading baggage on his back. 

“How does it look?” he inquired. 
“Any hope of getting that squadron 
of Peace Enforcers to stand by out- 
system?” 

“I’m afraid not; Sector HQ seems 
to feel that might be interpreted by 
the Krultch as a ' war-like gesture.”

IF 




“Certainly it would! That’s exactly 
what the Krultch can under- 
stand — ” 

“Ambassador Sheepshorn has 
great faith in the power of words,” 
Retief said soothingly. “He has a 
reputation as a great verbal karate 
expert; the Genghis Khan of the 
conference table.” 

“But what if you lose? The cabi- 
net votes on the Krultch treaty 
tomorrow! If it’s signed, Gaspierre 
will be nothing but a fueling station 
for the Krultch battle fleet! And 
you Terries will end up slaves!” 
“A sad end for a great oral 
athlete,” Retief said. “Let’s hope he’s 
in good form tomorrow.” 

I n the shabby room on the 
twelfth level, Retief tossed a 
thick plastic coin to the baggage 
slave, who departed emitting the 
thin squeaking that substituted in 
his species for a jaunty whistle. 
Mulvihill, a huge man with a 
handlebar mustache, looked around, 
plumped his vast, bulging suitcase 
to the thin carpet, and mopped at 
the purple-fruit stain across his red 
plastiweve jacket. 

“I’d like to get my hands on the 
Gasper (hat threw that,” he growled 
in a bullfrog voice. 

“That’s a mean crowd out there,” 
said Miss La Flamme, a shapely red- 
head with a tattoo on her left 
biceps. “It was sure a break for us 
the Ambassador changed his mind 
about helping us out. From the look 
the old sourpuss gave me when I 
kind of bumped up against him, I 
figured he had ground glass where 
his red corpuscles ought to be.” 



“I got a sneaking hunch Mr. 
Retief swung this deal on his own, 
Suzie,” the big man said. “The Am- 
bassador’s got bigger things on his 
mind than out-of-work variety acts.” 
“This is the first time the Marve- 
lous Merivales have ever been flat 
out of luck on tour,” commented a 
whiskery little man . no more than 
three feet tall, dressed in an old- 
fashioned frock coat and a check- 
ered vest, in a voice like the yap of 
a Pekinese. “How come we got to 
get mixed up in politics?” 

“Shut up, Willie,” the big man 
said. “It’s not Mr. Retief s fault wc 
came here.” 

“Yeah,” the midget conceded. “1 
guess you fellows in the CDT got 
it kind of rough too, trying to pry 
the Gaspers outa the Kniltch’s hip 
’pocket. Boy, I wisti I could see the 
show tomorrow when the Terry 
Ambassador and the Krultch brass 
slug it out to see whose side the 
Gaspers’ll be neutral on.” 

“Neutral, ha!” the tall, cadaverous 
individual looming behind Wee Wil- 
lie snorted. “I caught a glimpse of 
that ferocious war vessel at the port, 
openly flying the Krultch battle- 
flag! It’s an open breach of inter- 
world custom — ” 

“Hey, Professor, leave the speech- 
es to the CDT,” the girl said. 

“Without free use of Gaspierre 
ports, the Krultch plans for expan- 
sion through the Gloob cluster 
would come to naught. A firm 
stand — ” 

“Might get ’em blasted right off 
the planet,” the big man growled. 
“The Krultch play for keeps.” 
“And the Gaspers aim to be on 

9 



TRICK OR TREATY 




the winning side,” the midget piped. 
“And all the smart money is on the 
Krultch battle wagon to put up the 
best argument.” 

“Terries are fair game around 
here, it looks like, Mr. Retief,” 
Mulvihill said. “You better watch 
yourself going back.” 

Retief nodded. “Stay close to 
your rooms; if the vote goes against 
us tomorrow, we may all be looking 
for a quick way home.” 

II 

O utside on the narrow elevated 
walkway that linked the gray 
slab-like structures of the city, thin- 
featured Gaspierre natives shot wary 
looks at Retief, some skirting him 
wiJely, others jostling him as they 
crowded past. It was a short walk 
to the building where the Terrestrial 
delegation occupied a suite. As 
Retief neared it, a pair of Krultch 
sailors emerged from a shop, turned 
in his direction. They were short- 
coupled centauroid quadrupeds, with 
deep, narrow chests, snouted faces 
with businesslike jaws and fringe 
beards, dressed in the red-striped 
livery of the Krultch Navy, com- 
plete with side-arms and short 
swagger sticks. 

Retief altered course to the right 
to give th^m passing room; they 
saw him, nudged each other, and 
spaced themselves to block the walk. 
Retief came on without slowing, 
started between them. The Krultch 
closed ranks. Retief stepped back 
started around the sailor on the 
left. The creature sidled, still block- 
ing his path. 



“Oh-hoh, Terry loose in street,” 
he said in a v<Hce like sand in a 
gear-box. “You lost, Terry?” 

The other Krultch crowded Re- 
tief against the rail. “Where you 
from, Terry? What you do — ?” 
Without warning, Retief slammed 
a solid kick to the shin of the 
Krultch before him, simultaneously 
wrenched the stick from the alien’s 
grip, cracked it down sharply across 
the wrist of the other sailor as he 
went for his gun. The weapon 
clattered, skidded off the walk and 
was gone. The one whom Retief 
had kicked was hopping on three 
legs, making muffled sounds of 
agony. Retief stepped quickly to 
him, jerked his gun from its holster, 
aimed it negligently at the other 
Krultch. 

“Better get your buddy back to 
the ship and have that leg looked 
at,” he said. “I think 1 broke it.” 
A ring of gaping Gaspierre had 
gathered, choking the walk. Retief 
thrust the pistol into his pocket, 
turned his back on the Krultch, 
pushed through the locals. A large 
course-hided Gaspierre policeman 
made as if to block his way; Retief 
rammed an elbow in his side, chop- 
ped him across the side of the neck 
as he doubled up, thrust him aside 
and kept going. A mutter was rising 
from the crowd behind him. 

T he Embassy was just ahead 
now. Retief turned off toward 
the entry; two yellow-uniformed 
Gaspierre moved into sight under 
the marquee, eyed him as he came 
up. 

“Terran, have you not heard of 

IF 



10 




Ifac curfew?” one demanded in shrill 
but accurate Terran. 

“Can’t say that I have,” Retief 
replied. “There wasn’t any, an hour 
•go.” 

“There is now!” the other snapped. 
“You Terries are not popular here. 
If you insist in u^aming the popu- 
lace by walking abroad, we cannot 
be responsible for your safety — ” 
he broke off as he saw the Krultch 
pistol protruding from Retiefs 
pocket. 

“Where did you get that?” he 
demanded in Gaspierran, then 
switched to pidgin Terran: “Where 
you-fella catch um bang-bang?” 

“A couple of lads were playing 
with it in the street,” Retief said in 
the local dialect. “I took it away 
from them before someone got 
hurt.” He started past them. 

“Hold on there,” the policeman 
snapped, “We’re not finished with 
you yet, fellow. We’ll tell you when 
you can go. Now ...” He folded 
his upper elbows. “You’re to go to 
your quarters at once. In view of 
the tense interplanetary situation, 
you Terries are to remain inside 
until further notice. I have my men 
posted on all approaches to, ah, 
provide protection.” 

“You’re putting a diplomatic 
mission under arrest?” Retief in- 
quired mild-ly. 

“I wouldn’t call it that. Let’s just 
say that it wouldn’t be safe for 
foreigners to venture abroad. ’ 

“Threats too?” 

“This measure is necessary in 
order to prevent unfortunate inci- 
dents!” 

“How about the Krultch? They’re 



foreigners; are you locking them in 
their bedrooms?” 

“The Krultch are old and valued 
friends of the Gaspierre,” the police 
captain said stiffly. “We — ” 

“I know; ever since they set 
an armed patrol just outside Gas- 
pierran atmosphere, you’ve, devd- 
oped a vast affection for them. Oi 
course, their purchasing missions 
help too.” 

T he captain smirked. “We Gas- 
pierre are nothing if not 
practical.” He held out his claw-like 
two-fingered hand. “You will now 
give me the weapon.” 

Retief handed it over silently. 
“Come; I will escort you to your 
room,” the cop said. 

Retief nodded complacently, fol- 
lowed the Gaspierre through the 
entry cubicle and into the lift. 

“I’m glad you’ve decided to be 
reasonable,” the cop said. “After all, 
if you Terries should convince the 
cabinet, it will be much nicer all 
around if there have been no inci- 
dents.” 

“How true,” Retief murmured. 
He left the car at the 20th floor. 
“Don’t forget, now,” the cop said, 
watching Retief key his door. “Just 
stay inside and all will yet be well.” 
He signalled to a policeman stand- 
ing a few yards , along the corridor. 

“Keep an eye on the door, 
Klosta.” 

Inside, Retief picked up the 
phone, dialed the Ambassador’s 
room number. There was a dry 
buzz, no answer. He looked around 
the room. There was a tall, narrow 
window set in the wall opposite the 



TRICK OR TREATY 



11 




door with a hinged section that 
swung outward. Retief opened it, 
leaned out, looked down at the 
dizzying stretch of blank facade that 
dropped sheer to the upper walkway 
seventy yards below. Above, the 
wall extended up twenty feet to an 
overhanging cornice. He went to the 
closet, yanked a blanket from the 
shelf, ripped it in four wide strips, 
knotted them together, and tied one 
end to a chair which he braced 
below the window. 

Retief swung his legs outside the 
window, grasped the blanket-rope, 
and slid down. 

The window at the next level was 
closed and shuttered. Retief braced 
himself on the sill, delivered a sharp 
kick to the panel; it shattered with 
an explosive sound. He dropped 
lower, reached through, released the 
catch, pulled the window wide, 
knocked the shutter aside, and 
scrambled through into a darkened 
room. 

“Who’s there?” a sharp voice 
barked. A tall, lean man in a 
ruffled shirt with an unknotted 
string tie hanging down the front 
gaped at Retief from the inner 
room. 

“Retief! How did you get here? 
I understood that none of the staff 
were to be permitted — that is, I 
agreed that protective custody — er, 
it seems ...” 

4 4'"T^he whole staff is bottled up 
A here in the building. Mr. 
Ambassador. I’d guess tbc^ mean to 
keep us here until after the Cabinet 
meeting. It appears the Krultch have 
the fix in.” 



“Nonsense! I have a firm com- 
mitment from the Minister that no 
final commitment will be made 
until we’ve been heard — ” 
“Meanwhile, we’re under house 
arrest — just to be sure we don’t 
have an opportunity to bring any 
of the cabinet around to our side.” 
“Are you suggesting that I’ve 
permitted illegal measures to be 
taken without a protest?” Ambas- 
sador Sheepshorn fixed Retief with 
a piercing gaze which wilted, and 
slid aside. “The place was alive with 
armed gendarmes,” he sighed. “What 
could I do?” 

“A few shrill cries of outrage 
might have helped,” Retief pointed 
out. “It’s not too late. A fast 
visit to the Foreign Office — ” 

“Are you out of your mind? Have 
you observed the temper of the 
populace? We’d be torn to shreds!” 
Retief nodded. “Quite possibly; 
but what do you think our chances 
are tomorrow, after the Gaspierre 
conclude a treaty with the Krultch?” 
Sheepshorn made two tries, then 
swallowed hard. “Surely, Retief, you 
don’t — ” 

“I’m afraid I do,” Retief said. 
“The Krultch need a vivid symbol 
of their importance — and they’d 
also like to involve the Gaspierre in 
their skulduggery, just to insure 
their loyalty. Packing a clutch oi 
Terry diplomats off to the ice mines 
would do both jobs.” 

“A great pity,” the Ambassador 
sighed. “And only nine months to 
go till my retirement.” 

“I’ll have to be going now,” Re- 
tief said. “There may be a posse of 
annoyed police along at any mo- 



12 



IF 




ment, and I’d hate to make it too 
easy for them.” 

“Police? You mean they’re not 
even waiting until after the Cabi- 
net’s decision?” 

“Oh, this is just a personal matter; 
I damaged some Krultch Naval 
property and gave a Gaspierre cop 
a pain in the neck.” 

“I’ve warned you about your 
personality, Retief,” Sheepshorn ad- 
monished. “I suggest you give your- 
self up, and ask for clemency; with 
luck, you’ll get to go along to the 
mines with the rest of us. I’ll per- 
sonally put in a good word!” 
“That would interfere with my 
plans. I’m afraid,” Retief said. He 
went to the door. “I’ll try to be 
back before the Gaspierre do any- 
thing irrevocable. Meanwhile, hold 
the fort here. If they come for you, 
quote regulations at them; I’m sure 
they’ll find that discouraging.” 
“Plans? Retief, I positively forbid 
you to — ” 

Retief stepped through the door 
and closed it behind him, cutting 
off the flow of Ambassadorial wis- 
dom. A flat policeman, posted a 
few feet along the corridor came 
to the alert. 

“All right, you can go home now,” 
Retief said, in brisk Gaspierran. “The 
chief changed his mind; he decided 
violating a Terran Embassy’s quar- 
ters was just asking for trouble. 
After all, the Krultch haven’t won 
yet.” 

The cop stared at him, then 
nodded. “I wondered if this wasn’t 
kind of getting the rickshaw before 
the coolie ...” he hesitated. “But 
what do you know about it?” 



“I just had a nice chat with the 
captain, one floor up.” 

“Well, if he let you come down 
here, I guess it’s all right.” 

“If you hurry, you can make it 
back to the barracks before the 
evening rush begins.” Retief waved 
airily and strolled away along the 
corridor. 

ni 

B ack at ground level, Retief went 
along a narrow service pas- 
sage leading to the rear of the 
building, stepped out into a deserted- 
looking courtyard. There was an- 
other door across the way. He went 
to it, followed another hall to a 
street exit. There were no cops in 
sight. He took the sparsely peopled 
lower walkway, set off at a brisk 
walk. 

Ten minutes later, Retief survey- 
ed the approaches to the Hostelry 
Ritz-Krudlu from the shelter of an 
inter-level connecting stair. There 
was a surging crowd of Gaspierre 
blocking the walkway, with a scat- 
tering of yellow police uniforms 
patrolling the edge of the mob. 
Placards lettered TERRY GO 
HOME and KEEP GASPIERRE 
BROWN bobbed above the sea of 
flattened heads. Off to one side, a 
heavily braided Krultch officer 
stood with a pair of age-tarnished 
locals, looking on approvingly. 

Retief retraced his steps to the 
debris-littered ground level twenty 
feet below the walkway, found an 
eighteen-inch wide airspace leading 
back between buildings. He inched 
along it, came to a door, found it

into Reliefs hand. “Sit down and

“Glad you came to us, Relief,” 
Wee Willie piped. 

Relief took the offered chair, 
sampled the drink, then outlined the 
situation. 

“What I have tn mind could be 
dangerous,” he finished. 

“What ain’t?” Willie demanded. 

“It calls for a delicate touch and 
some fancy footwork,” Relief add- 
ed. 

The professor cleared his throat. 
“I am not without a certain dex- 
terity — ” he started. 

“Let him finish,” the redhead said. 

“And I’m not even sure ifs pos-

“There’s a lot of things that look

“How are we going to get out 
past that crowd out front?” Mulvi- 
hill inquired. “I’ve got a feeling 
they’re ready for something stronger 
than slogans.” 

“We’ll try the back way.” 

There was a sudden hubbub from 
the far end of the corridor; half a 
dozen Gaspierre burst into view, 
puffing hard from a fast climb. 
They hissed, pointed, and started 
for the Terrans at a short-legged 
trot. At the same moment, a door 
flew wide at the opposite end of 
the hallway; more locals popped 
into view, closed in. 

“Looks like a neck-tie party,” Wee 
Willie barked. “Go get ’em, Julie!” 
He put his head down and charged. 
The on-coming natives slowed, 
skipped aside. One, a trifle slow, 
bounced against the wall as the mid- 
get rammed him at knee level. The 
others whirled, grabbing at Wee 
Willie as he skidded to a halt. Mul- 
vihill roared, took three giant steps, 
caught two Gaspierre by the backs 
of their leathery necks, lifted them 
and tossed them aside. 

The second group of locals, emit- 
ting wheezes of excitement, dashed 
up, eager for the fray. Retief met 
one with a straight right, knocked 
two more aside with a sweep of his 
arm, sprinted for the door through 
which th6 second party of locals 
had appeared. He looked back to 
see Mulvihill toss another Gaspierre 
aside, pluck Wee Willie from the 
melee. 

“Down here, Julie!” The girl 
called. “Come on. Professor!” 

The tall, lean Terran, backed 
against the wall by three hissing 



locals, stretched out a yard-long 
aim, flapped his hand. A large white 
pigeon appeared, fluttered, squawk- 
ing and snorting. Professor Fate 
plunged through them, grabbed the 
bird by the legs as he passed, dashed 
for the door where Retief and the 
girl waited. 

There was a sound of pounding 
feet from the stairwell; a fresh 
contingent of locals came charging 
into view on stub legs. Retief took 
two steps, caught the leader full in 
the face with a spread hand, sent 
him among his followers, as Mulvi- 
hill appeared. Wee Willie over his 
shoulder yelling and kicking. 

“There’s more on the way,” Re- 
tief called. “We’ll have to go up.” 

The girl nodded, started up, thn^e 
steps at a time. Mulvihill dropped 
the midget, who scampered after 
her. Professor Fate tucked his bird 
away, disappeared up the stairs in 
giant strides, Mulvihill and Retief 
behind him. 

O n the roof, Retief slammed the 
heavy door, shot the massive 
bolt. It was late evening now; cool 
blue air flowed across the unrailed ^ 
deck; faint crowd-sounds floated up 
from the street twenty stories be- 
low. 

“Willie, go secure that other 
door,” Mulvihill commanded. He 
went to the edge of the roof, looked 
down, shook his head, started across 
toward another side. The redhead 
called to him. 

“Over here, Julie ...” 

Retief joined Mulvihill at her 
side. A dozen feet down and twenty 
feet distant across a narrow street 




was the slanted roof of an adjacent 
building. A long ladder was clamped 
to brackets near the ridge. 

“Looks like that’s it,” Mulvihill 
nodded. Suzette unlimbered a coil 
of light line from a clip at her 
waist, gauged the distance to a pro- 
jecting ventilator intake, swung the 
rope, and let it fly. The broad loop 
spread, slapped the opposite roof, 
and encircled the target. With a 
tug, the girl tightened the noose, 
quickly whipped the end around a 
four-inch stack. She stooped, pulled 
off her shoes, tucked them in her 
belt, tried the taut rope with one 
foot. 

“Take it easy, baby,” Mulvihill 
muttered. She nodded, stepped out 
on the taut, down-slanting cable, 
braced her feet, spread her arms, 
and in one smooth swoop, slid along 
the line and stepped off the far end, 
turned and executed a quick curt- 
sey. 

“This is no time to ham it up,” 
Mulvihill boomed. 

“Just habit,” the girl said. She 
went up the roof, freed the ladder, 
rdeased the catch that caused an 
extensible section to slide out, then 
came back to the roofs edge, deft- 
ly raised, the ladder to a vertical 
position. 

“Catch!” she let it lean toward 
Mulvihill and Retief; as it fell both 
men caught it, lowered it the last 
foot. 

“Hey, you guys,” Willie called, “I 
can’t get this thing locked!” 

“Never mind that now,” Mulvi- 
hill rumbled. “Come on, Prof,” he 
said to the lean prestidigitator. “You 
first.” 



The professor’s Adam’s apple 
bobbed as he swallowed. He peered 
down at the street far below, then 
threw his shoulders back, clambered 
up onto the ladder, and started 
across on all fours. 

“Don’t look down Professor,” 
Suzie called. “Look at me.” 

“Let’s go, Willie!” Mulvihill called 
over his shoulder. He freed the 
rope, tossed it across, then stepped 
up on the ladder, started across, one 
small step at a time. “This isn’t my 
strong suit,” he muttered, teeth to- 
gether. The Professor had reached 
the far side. Mulvihill was half way. 
There was a sudden yelp from Wil- 
lie. Retief turned. The midget was 
struggling against a door which was 
being forced open from inside. 

44 T Tey!” Mulvihill boomed. Suzie 
squealed. Retief sprinted 
for the embattled midget, caught 
him as he was hurled backward as 
the door flew open, disgorging three 
Gaspierre who staggered for bal- 
ance, and went down as Retief 
thrust out a foot. He thrust Wee 
Willie aside, picked up the nearest 
native, pitched him back inside, 
followed with the other two, then 
slammed the door, and tried the 
bolt. 

“It’s sprung,” he said. “Let’s go, 
Willie!” He caught up the small man, 
ran for the ladder where Mulvihill 
still stood, halfway across. 

“Come on, Julie!” The girl cried, 
“It won’t hold both of you!” 

There were renewed breathy yells 
from the site of the scuffle. The 
door had burst open and more Gas- 
pierre were spilling from it. Mulvi-

hill snorted, finished the crossing in 
two jumps, scrambled for footing on 
the slanting roof. Retief stepped out 
on the limber ladder, started across, 
Willie under his arm. 

‘Took out!” Suzette said sharp- 
ly. The rungs jumped under Retiefs 
feet. He reached the roof, dropped 
the midget, and turned to see a 
huddle of Gaspierre tugging at the 
ladder. One rendered reckless in 
his zeal, started across. Retief picked 
up the end of the ladder, shook it; 
tile local squeaked, scrambled back. 
Retief hauled the ladder in. 

“Up here,” the girl called. Retief 
went up the slope, looked down at 
an open trap door in the opposite 
slope. He followed the others down 
tiirough it into a musty loft, latched 
it behind him. The loft door opened 
into an empty hall. They followed 
k, found a lift, rode it down to 
ground level. Outside in a littered 
alley, the crowd noises were faint. 

“We appear to have outfoxed the 
ruffians,” Professor Fate said, ad- 
justing his cuffs. 

“The Gaspers ain’t far behind,” 
Wee Willie shrilled. “Let’s make 
tracks.” 

“We’ll find a spot and hide out 
until dark,” Retief said. “Then we’ll 
make our try.” 

IV 

A faint gleam from Gaspierre’s 
three bright-star-sized moons 
dimly illuminated the twisting alley 
along which Retief led the four 
Terrans. 

“The port is half a mile from the 
city wall,” he said softly to Mulvi- 



hill at his side. “We can climb it 
between watchtowers, and circle 
around and hit the ramp from the 
east.” 

“They got any guards posted out 
there?” the big man asked. 

“Oh-oh, here’s the wall ...” The 
barrier loomed up, twelve feet high. 
Suzette came forward, looked it 
over. 

“I’ll check the top,” she said. 
“Give me a boost, Julie.” He lifted 
her, raised her to arm’s length. She 
put a foot on the top of his head, 
stepped up. 

Mulvihill grunted. “Watch out 
some Gasper cop doesn’t spot you.” 

“Coast is clear.” She pulled her- 
self up. “Come on, Willie, I’ll give 
you a hand.” Mulvihill lifted the 
midget, who caught the girl’s hand, 
and scrambled up. Mulvihill bent 
over, and Retief stepped in his 
cupped hands, then to the big man’s 
shoulders, and reached the top of 
the wall. The girl lowered her rope 
for Mulvihill. He clambered up, 
swearing softly, with Retief’s help 
hoisted his bulk to the top of the 
wall. A moment later the group was 
moving off quietly across open 
ground toward the south edge of 
the port. 

Lying flat at the edge of the ramp, 
Retief indicated a looming, light- 
encrusted silhouette. 

“That’s her,” he said. “Half a 
million tons, crew of three hundred.” 

“Big enough, ain’t she?” Wee Wil- 
lie chirped. 

“Hsst! There’s a Krultch!” Mul- 
vihill pointed. 

Retief got to his feet. “Wait until 
I get in position behind that fud

IF 




monitor/’ He pointed to a dark 
shape crouching fifty feet distant. 
“Then make a few suspicious noises.” 
“I better go with you, Retief,” 
Mulvihill started, but Retief was 
gone. He moved forward silently, 
reached the shelter of the heavy 
apparatus, watched the Krultch sen- 
tinel move closer, stepping daintily 
as a deer on its four sharp hooves. 
The alien had reached a point a 
hundred feet distant when there 
was a sharp ping! from behind 
Retief. The guard halted; Retief 
heard the snick of a power gun’s 
action. The Krultch turned toward 
him. He could hear the cli-clack, 
cli-clack of the hooves now. At a 
distance of ten feet, the quadruped 
slowed, came to a halt. Retief could 
see the vicious snout of the gun 
aimed warily into the darkness. 
There was another sound from Mul- 
vihill’s position. The guard plucked 
something from the belt rigged 
across his chest, and started toward 
the source of the sound. As he 
passed Retief he shied suddenly, and 
grabbed for his communicator. Re- 
def leaped, landed a haymaker on 
die bony face, and caught the mic- 
rophone before it hit the pavement. 
The Krultch, staggering back from 
the blow, went to his haunches and 
struck out with knife-edged forefeet. 
Retief ducked aside, chopped hard 
at the collar bone. The Krultch 
collapsed with a choked cry. Mul- 
vihill appeared at a run, seized the 
feebly moving guard, pulled off the 
creature’s belt, trussed his four legs 
together, and then, using other 
straps to bind the hands, he gagged 
the powerful jaws. 



“Now what?” Wee Willie inquired. 
“You gonna cut his throat?” 
“Shove him back of the monitor,” 
Mulvihill said. 

“Now let’s see how close we can 
get to the ship without getting 
spotted,” Retief said. 

T he mighty Krultch war vessel, 
a black column towering into 
the night, was ablaze with vari- 
colored running and navigation 
lights. Giant floods mounted far up 
on the ship’s sleek sides cast puddles 
of blue-white radiance on the tar- 
mac; from the main cabin amid- 
ships, softer light gleamed through 
wide view windows. 

“All lit up like a party,” Mulvihill 
growled. 

“A tough party to crash,” Wee 
Willie said, looking up the long 
slant of the hull. 

“I think I see a route, Mr. Retief,” 
the girl said. “What’s that little 
square opening up there, just past 
the gun emplacement?” 

“It looks as though it might be a 
cargo hatch. It’s not so little. Miss 
La Flamme! it’s a long way up — ” 
“You reckon I could get through 
it?” 

Retief nodded, looking up at the 
smooth surface above. “Can you 
make it up there?” 

“They used to bill me as the 
human lady-bug. Nothing to it.” 
“If you get in,” Retief said, “Try 
to find your way back down into 
the tube compartment. If you can 
open one of these access panels, 
we’re in.” 

Suzette nodded, took out her 
rope, tossed a loop over a projec-

tion fifteen feet above, and clam- 
bered quickly up the landing jack to 
its junction with the smooth metal 
of the hull. She put her hands flat 
against the curving, slightly in- 
slanting wall before her, planted 
one crepe-soled shoe against a tiny 
weld seam and started up the sheer 
wall. 

Ten minutes passed. From the 
deep shadow at the ship’s stern, 
Retief watched as the slim girl 
inched her way up, skirting a row 
of orange glare panels spelling out 
the name of the vessel in blocky 
Krultch ideographs, taking advan- 
tage of a ventilator outlet for a 
minute’s rest, then going on up, up, 
thirty feet now, forty, forty-five . 

She reached the open hatch 
raised her head cautiously for a 
glance inside, then swiftly pulled up 
and disappeared through the open- 
ing. 

Julius Mulvihill heaved a sigh of 
relief. “That was as tough a climb 
as Suzie ever made,” he rumbled. 

“Don’t get happy yet,” Wee Willie 
piped up. “Her troubles is just 
starting.” 

“I’m sure she’ll encounter no 
difficulty,” Professor Fate said anx- 
iously. “Surely there’ll be no one on 
duty aft, here in port.” 

More minutes ticked past. Then 
there was a rasp of metal, a gentle 
clatter. A few feet above ground, a 
panel swung out: Suzie’s face ap- 
peared, oil streaked. 

“Boy this place needs a good 
scrubbing,” she breathed. “Come on; 
they’re all having a shindig up 
above, sounds like.” 

Inside the echoing, gloomy vault 



of the tub compartment, Retief 
studied the layout of equipment, the 
placement of giant cooling baffles, 
and the contour of the bulkheads. 

“This is a Krultch-built job,” he 
said. “But it seems to be a pretty 
fair copy of an old Concordiat 
cruiser of the line. That means the 
controls are all the way forward.” 
“Let’s get started!” Wee Willie 
went to the wide-runged catwalk 
designed for goat-like Krultch feet, 
started up. The others followed. Re- 
tief glanced around, reached for the 
ladder. As he did, a harsh Krultch 
voice snapped, “Halt where you are, 
Terrans!” 

R etief turned slowly. A dirt- 
smeared Krultch in baggy 
coveralls stepped from the conceal- 
ment of a massive ion-collector, a 
grim-looking power gun aimed. He 
waited as a second and third sailor 
followed him, all armed. 

“A nice catch, Udas,” one said 
admiringly in Krultch. “The captain 
said we’d have Terry labor to do 
the dirty work on the run back, but 
I didn’t expect to see ’em volun- 
teering.” 

“Get ’em down here together, 
Jesau,” the first Krultch barked, ffli 
partner came forward, motioned 
with the gun. 

“Retief, you savvy Fustian?” Mid- 
vihill muttered. 

“Uh-huh,” Retief answered. 
“You hit the one on the left; FH 
take the bird on the right. Pro- 
fessor — ” 

“Not yet,” Retief said. 

“No talk!” the Krultch barked ia 
Terran. “Come downl” 



20 



IF 




The Terrans descended to the 
deck, stood in a loose group. 

“Closer together!” the sailor said; 
he poked the girl with the gun to 
emphasize the command. She smiled 
at him sweetly. “You bat-eared son 
of a goat, just wait till I get a 
handful of your whiskers!” 

“No talk!” 

Professor Fate edged in front of 
the girl. He held out both hands 
toward the leading Kruitch, flipped 
them over to show both sides, then 
twitched his wrists, fanned two sets 
of playing cards. He waved them 
under the astounded nose of the 
nearest gunman, and with a flick 
they disappeared. 

The two rearmost sailors stepped 
closer, mouths op^n. The professor 
snapped his fingers; flame shot from 
the tip of each pointed forefinger. 
The Krultch jumped. The tall Ter- 
ran waved his hands, whipped a 
gauzy blue handkerchief from no- 
where, swirled it around; now it was 
red. He snapped it sharply, and a 
shower of confetti scattered around 
the dumbfounded Krultch. He dou- 
bled his fists, popped them open; 
whoofed into the aliens’ faces. A 
final wave, and a white bird was 
squawking in the air. 

“Now!” Retief said, and took a 
step, uppercut the leading sailor; die 
slender legs buckled as the creature 
went down with a slam. Mulvihill 
was past him, catching Krultch 
number two with a roundhouse 
swipe. The third sailor made a sound 
like tearing sheet metal, brought his 
gun to bear on Retief as Wee Willie, 
hurtling forward, hit him at the 
knees. The shot melted a furrow 



TRICK OR TREATY 



in the wall as Mulvihill floored the 
hapless creature with a mighty 
Wow. 

“Neatly done,” Professor Fate 
said, tucking things back into his 
cuffs. “Almost a pity to lose sucli 
an appreciative audience.” 

W ith the three Krultch securely 
strapped hand and foot in 
their own harnesses, Retief nudged 
one with his foot. 

“We have important business to 
contract in the control room,” he 
said. “We don’t want to disturb 
anyone, Jesau, so we’d prefer a 
nice quiet approach via the back 
stairs. What would you suggest?” 
The Krultch made a suggestion. 
Retief said, “Professor, perhaps 
you’d better give him a few more 
samples.” 

“Very well.” Professor Fate step- 
ped forward, waved his hands; a 
slimrbladed knife appeared in one. 
He tested the edge with his thumb, 
which promptly dripped gore. He 
stroked the thumb with another 
finger; the blood disappeared. He 
nodded. 

“Now, fellow,” he said to the 
sailor. “I’ve heard you rascals place 
great store by your beards; what 
about a shave?” He reached — 

The Krultch made a sound like 
glass shattering. “The port catwalk!” 
he squalled. “But you won’t get 
away with this!” 

“Oh, no?” The professor smiled 
gently, made a pass in the air, 
plucked a small cylinder from no- 
where. 

“I doubt if anyone will be along 
this way for many hours,” he said. 



“If we fail to return saf^y in an 
hour, this little device will detonate 
with sufficient force to distribute 
your component atoms over approx- 
imately twelve square miles.” He 
placed the object by the Krultch, 
who rolled horrified eyes at it. 

“Oh — on second thought, try the 
service catwalk behind the main 
tube,” he squeaked. 

“Good enough,” Retief said. 
“Let’s go.” 

V 

T he sounds of Krultch revelry 
were loud in the cramped 
passage. 

“Sounds like they’re doing a little 
early celebrating for tomorrow’s 
big diplomatic victory,” Mulvihill 
said. “You suppose most of them 
are in there?” 

“There’ll be a few on duty,” 
Retief said. “But that sounds like a 
couple of hundred out of circulation 
for the moment — until we trip 
something and give the alarm.” 

“The next stretch is all right,” 
Professor Fate said, coming back 
dusting off his hands. “Then I’m 
afraid we shall have to emerge into 
the open.” 

“We’re not far from the command 
deck now,” Retief said. “Another 
twenty feet, vertically, ought to do 
it.” 

The party clambered on up, 
negotiated a sharp turn, came to an 
exit panel. Professor Fate put his 
ear against it. 

“All appears silent,” he said. 
“Shall we sally forth?” 

Retief came to the panel, eased

it open, glanced out; then he stepped 
through, motioned the others to 
follow. It was quieter here; there 
was deep-pile carpeting underfoot, 
an odor of alien food and drug- 
smoke in the air. 

“Officers’ country,” Mulvihill mut- 
tered. 

Retief pointed toward a door 
marked with Krultch lettering. 
“Anybody read that?” he whispered. 

There were shakes of the head 
and whispered negatives. 

“We’ll have to take a chance.” 
Retief went to the door, gripped the 
latch, and yanked it suddenly wide. 
An obese Krultch in uniform belt 
but without his tunic looked up 
from a brightly colored magazine 
on the pages of which Retief 
glimpsed glossy photos of slender- 
built Krultch mares flirting saucy 
derrieres at the camera. 

The alien stuffed the magazine in 
a desk slot, came to his feet, gaping, 
than whirled and dived for a con- 
trol panel across the narrow passage 
in which he was posted. He reached 
a heavy lever and hauled it down 
just as Retief caught him with a 
flying tackle. Man and Krultch hit 
the deck together; Relief’s hand 
chopped; the Krultch kicked twice 
and lay still. 

“That lever — you suppose — ” 
Wee Willie started. 

4 4 “probably an alarm,” Retief 

A said, coming to his feet. 
“Come on!” he ran along the cor- 
ridor; it turned sharply to the right. 
A heavy door was sliding shut be- 
fore him. He leaped to it, wedged 
himself in the narrowing opening, 



braced against the thrust of the steel 
panel. It slowed, with a groaning of 
machinery. Mulvihill charged up, 
grasped the edge of the door and 
heaved. Somewhere, metal creaked. 
There was a loud clunkl and a 
clatter of broken mechanism. 

The door slid freely back. 

“Close,” Mulvihill grunted. “For a 
minute there — ” he broke off at 
a sound from behind hirh. Ten feet 
back along the passage a second 
panel had slid noiselessly out, sealing 
off the corridor, Mulvihill jumped 
to it, heaved against it. 

Ahead, Retief saw a third panel, 
this one standing wide open. He 
plunged through it; skidded to a 
halt. A braided Krultch officer was 
waiting, a foot-long purple cigar 
in his mouth, a power gun in each 
hand. He kicked a lever near his 
foot. The door whooshed shut be- 
hind Retief. 

“Ah, welcome aboard, Terran,” 
the captain grated. “You can be the 
first of your kind to enjoy Krultch 
hospitality.” 

“I have been observing your pro- 
gress on my inspection screen here,” 
the captain nodded toward a small 
panel which showed a view of the 
four Terrans pushing fruitlessly 
against the doors that had closed to 
entrap them. 

“Interesting,” Retief commented. 

“You are surprised at the sophisti- 
cation of the equipment we Krultch 
can command?” the captain puffed 
out smoke, showed horny gums in a 
smile-like grimace. 

“No, anybody who can steal the 
price can buy a Groaci spy-eye 
system,” Retief said blandly. “But I

find it interesting that you had to 
spend all that cash just to keep an 
eye on your crew. Not too trust- 
worthy, eh?” y 

“What? Any of my crew would 
die at my command!” 

“They’ll probably get the chance, 
too,” Retief nodded agreement. 
“How about putting one of the guns 
down — unless you’re afraid of a 
misfire.” 

“Krultch guns never misfire.” The 
captain tossed one pistol aside. “But 
I agree: I am overprotected against 
the paltry threat of a single Terran.” 
“You’re forgetting — I have 
friends.” 

T he Krultch made a sound like 
fingernails on a blackboard. 
“They are effectively immobilized,” 
he said. “Now, tell me, what did 
you hope to accomplish by intruding 
here?” 

“I intend to place you under 
arrest,” Retief said. “Mind if I sit 
down?” 

The Krultch captain made laugh- 
ing noises resembling a flawed drive 
bearing; he waved a two-fingered 
claw-hand. 

“Make yourself comfortable — 
while you can,” he said. “Now, tell 
me, how did you manage to get 
your equipment up to my ship with- 
out being seen? I shall impale the 
slackers responsible, of course.” 
“Oh, we have no equipment.” 
Retief said breezily. He sniffed, 
“That’s not a Lovenbroy cigar, is 
it?” 

“Never smoke anything else,” the 
Krultch said. “Care for one?” 
“Don’t mind if I do,” Retief ad- 



mitted. He accepted an eighteen- 
inch stogie, lit up. 

“Now, about the equipment,” the 
captain persisted. “I assume you 
used fifty-foot scaling ladders, 
though I confess I don’t see how 
you got them onto the port — ” 
“Ladders?” Retief smiled comfort- 
ably. “We Terrans don’t need lad- 
ders; we just sprouted wings.” 
“Wings?” 

“Oh, we’re versatile, we Terries.” 
The captain was wearing an ex- 
pression of black disapproval now. 
“If you had no ladders, 1 must con- 
clude that you breached my hull at 
ground level,” he snapped. “What 
did you use? It would require at 
least a fifty K-T-Second power 
input to penetrate two inches of 
flint-steel — ” 

Retief shook his head, puffing out 
scented smoke. “Nice,” he said. “No, 
we just peeled back a panel bare- 
handed. We Terrans — ” 

“Blast you Terrans! Nobody 
could.” The captain clamped his 
jaws, puffed furiously. “Just outside, 
in the access-control chamber you 
sabotaged the closure mechanism. 
Where is the hydraulic jack you 
used for this?” 

“As I said, we Terrans — ” 

4 4'\7'ou entered the secret access 
1 passage almost as soon as 
you boarded my vessel!” the captain 
screeched. “My men are innoculated 
against every talk-drug known! 
What did you use on the traitor who 
informed you!” 

Retief held up a hand. “We Ter- 
rans can be very persuasive, Cap- 
tain. At this very moment, you

IF 




yourself, for example, are about to 
be persuaded of the futility of trying 
to out-maneuver us.” 

The Krultch commander’s mouth 
opened and closed. “Me!” he burst 
out. “You think that you can divert 
a Krultch officer from the perform- 
ance of his duty?” 

“Sure,” a high voice piped from 
above and behind the captain. 
“Nothing to it.” 

The Krultch’s hooves clattered as 
he whirled, froze at the sight of 
Wee Willie’s small, round face 
smiling down at him from the 
ventilator register above the control 
panel. In a smooth motion, Retief 
cracked the alien across the wrist, 
and twitched the gun from his 
nerveless hand. 

“You see?” he said as the officer 
stared from him to the midget and 
back. “Never underestimate us 
Terrans.” 

The captain drooped in his chair, 
mopping at his face with a polka- 
dotted hanky provided by Wee Wil- 
lie. 

“This interrogation is a gross il- 
legality!” he groaned. “I was assvu*ed 
that all your kind did was talk — ” 

“We’re a tricky lot,” Retief con- 
ceded. “But surely a little innocent 
deception can be excused, once you 
understand our natures. We love 
strife, and this seemed to be the 
easiest way to stir up some action.” 

“Stir up action?” the Krultch 
croaked. 

“There’s something about an ap- 
parently defenseless nincompoop 
that brings out the opportunist in 
people,” Retief said. “It’s a simple 
way for us to identify trouble- 



TRICK OR TREATY 



makers, so they can be dealt with 
expeditiously. I think you Krultch 
qualify handsomely. It’s convenient 
timing, because we have a number 
of new planet-wrecking devices 
we’ve been wanting to field-test.” 
‘'You’re bluffing!” the Krultch 
bleated. 

Retief nodded vigorously. “I have 
to warn you, but you don’t have to 
believe me. So if you still want to 
try conclusions — ” 

T here was a sharp buzz from the 
panel; a piercing yellow light 
blinked rapidly. The captain’s hand 
twitched as he eyed the phone. 

“Go ahead, answer it,” Retief 
said. “But don’t say anything that 
might annoy me. We Terrans have 
quick tempers.” 

The Krultch flipped a key. 
“Exalted One,” a rapid Krultch 
voice babbled from the panel. 
“We have been assassinated by cap- 
tives! I mean, captivated by assas- 
sins! There were twelve of them — or 
perhaps twenty! Some were as high 
as a hundred-year Fufu tree, and 
others smaller than hoof-nits! One 
had eyes of live coals, and flames 
ten feet long shot from his hands, 
melting all they touched, and an- 
other — ” 

“Silence!” the captain roared. 
“Who are you? Where are you? 
What in the name of the Twelve 
Devils is going on here!” He whirled 
on Retief. “Where are the rest of 
your commandos! How did they 
evade my surveillance system? 
What — ” 

“Ah-ah,” Retief clucked. “I’m 
asking the questions now. First, I’ll 

26 



have the names of all Gaspierre 
officials who accepted your bribes.” 
“You think I would betray my 
compatriots to death at your hands?” 
“Nothing like that; I just need 
to know who the cooperative ones 
are so I can make them better 
offers.” 

A low brackk! sounded; this time 
a baleful blue light winked. The 
Krultch officer eyed it warily. 

“That’s my outside hot line to the 
Foreign Office,” he said. “When 
word reaches the Gaspierre govern- 
ment of the piratical behavior you 
allegedly peaceful Terries indulge in 
behind the facade of diplomacy — ” 
“Go ahead, tell them,” Retief 
said. “It’s time they discovered they 
aren’t the only ones who understand 
the fine art of the triple-cross.” 
The Krultch lifted the phone. 
“Yes?” he snapped. His expression 
stiffened. He rolled an eye at Re- 
tief, then at Wee Willie. 

“What’s that?” he barked into the 
communicator. “Flew through the 
air? Climbed where? What do you 
mean, giant white birds!” 

“Boy,” Wee Willie exclaimed. 
“Them Gaspers sure exaggerate!” 
The captain eyed the tiny man in 
horror, comparing his height with 
Retief’s six-three. 

He shuddered. 

“I know,” he said into the phone. 
“They’re already here . ..” He 
dropped the instrument back on its 
hook, glanced at his panel, idlv 
reached — 

it'T^hat reminds me,” Retief said. 

A He pointed the gun at the 
center of the captain’s chest. “Order 



IF 




all hands to assemble amidships,” 
he said. 

“They — they’re already there,” 
the Krultch said unsteadily, his eyes 
fixed on the gun. 

“Just make sure.” 

The captain depressed a key, 
cleared his throat. 

“All hands to the central feeding 
area, on the double,” he said. 

There was a moment’s pause. 
Then a Krultch voice came back: 
“All except the stand-by crews in 
power section and armaments, I 
guess you mean. Exalted One” 

“I said all hands, damn you!” the 
officer snarled. He flipped off the 
communicator. “I don’t know what 
you think you’ll accomplish with 
this,” he barked. “I have three hun- 
dred fearless warriors aboard this 
vessel; you’ll never get off this ship 
alive!” 

Two minutes passed. The com- 
municator crackled. “All hands as- 
sembled, sir.” 

“Willie, you see that big white 
lever?” Retief said mildly. “Just pull 
it down, and the next one to it.” 

The captain made as if to move. 
The gun jumped at him, Willie went 
past the Krultch, wrestled the 
controls down. Far away, machin- 
ery rumbled. A distinct shock ran 
through the massive hull, then a 
second. 

“What was that?” Willie asked. 

“The disaster bulkheads, sliding 
shut,” Retief said. “The three hun- 
dred fearless warriors are nicely 
locked in between them.” 

The captain slumped, looking 
stricken. “How do you know so 
much about the operation of my 



vessel?” he demanded. “It’s classi- 
fied ...” 

“That’s the result of stealing 
someone else’s plans; the wrong 
people may have been studying 
them. Now, Willie go let Julius and 
the rest of the group in; then I 
think we’ll be ready to discuss sur- 
render terms.” 

“This is a day that will live in 
the annals of treachery,” the cap- 
tain grated hollowly. 

“Oh, I don’t think it needs to get 
into the annals,” Retief said. “Not 
if we can come to a private under- 
standing, just between gentlemen.” 

VI 

I t was an hour past sunrise when 
the emergency meeting of the 
Gaspierre Cabinet broke up. Ambas- 
sador Sheepshorn, emerging from 
the chamber deep in amiable con- 
versation with an uncomfortable- 
looking Krultch officer in elaborate 
full dress uniform, halted as he 
spied Retief. 

“Ah, there, my boy! I was a trifle 
concerned when you failed to return 
last evening; but, as I was just 
pointing out to the Captain here, 
it was really all just a dreadful 
misunderstanding. Once the Krultch 
position was made clear — that they 
really preferred animal husbandry 
and folk dancing to any sort of 
war-like adventures, the Cabinet 
was able to come to a rapid and 
favorable decision on the Peace-and 
-Friendship Treaty, giving Terrans 
full Most Favored Nation status.” 
“I’m glad to hear that, Mr. Am- 
bassador,” Retief said, nodding to

27 




the stoney-faced Krultch comman- 
der. “I’m sure we’d all rather en- 
gage in friendly competition than 
have to demonstrate our negotiating 
ability any further.” 

There was a stir at the end of 
the corridor; a harried-looking 
Krultch officer with a grimy 
Krultch yeoman in tow appeared, 
came up to the captain, and saluted. 

“Exalted One, this fellow has just 
escaped from some sort of magical 
paralysis.” 

“It was that one,” the sailor in- 
dicated Retief. “Him and the others.” 
He looked reproachfully at Retief. 
“That was a dirty trick, telling us 
that was a bomb you were planting; 
we spend a rough night before we 
found out it was just a dopestick.” 
“Sorry,” Retief said. 

“Look, Exalted One,” the sailor 
went on in a stage whisper. “What 
I wanted to warn you about, that 
Terry — the long one, with the 
pointed tail and the fiery breath; 
he’s a warlock; he waves his hands 
and giant white flying creatures 
appear — ” 

“Silence, idiot!” the captain bel- 
lowed. “Have you no powers of 
observation? They don’t merely 
produce birds; any fool could do 
that\ They transform themselves! 
Now get out of my sight! I plan 
to enter a monastery as soon as we 
return home, and I want to get 
started on my meditating!” He nod- 
ded curtly and clattered away. 

4C/^dd sort of chap,” Sheepshorn 
commented. “I wonder 
what he was talking about?” 

“Just some sort of in-group joke. 



I imagine,” Retief said. “By the way, 
about that group of distressed ter- 
rans I mentioned to you — ” 

“Yes. I may have been a bit 
abrupt with them, Retief; but of 
course I was busy planning my 
strategy for today’s meeting. Per- 
haps I was hasty. I hereby authorize 
you to put in a good word for them.” 
“I took the liberty of going a 
little farther than that,” Retief said. 
“Since the new treaty calls for Ter- 
ran cultural missions, I signed a six 
months contract with them to put 
on shows here on Gaspierre.’* 
Sheepshorn frowned. “You went 
a bit beyond your authority, Retief,” 
he snapped. “I’d thought we might 
bring in a nice group or two to read 
classic passages from the Congres- 
sional Record, or perform some of 
the new silent music; and I had 
half-way promised the Garoci Min- 
ister I’d have one of his nose-flute 
troupes — ” 

“I thought it might be a good 
idea to show Terr an solidarity, just 
at this juncture,” Retief pointed out. 
“Then, too, a demonstration of 
sword-swallowing, prestidigitation, 
fire-eating, juggling, tight-rope walk- 
ing, acrobatics and thaumaturgics 
might be just the ticket for drama- 
tizing versatility.” 

Sheepshorn considered with pur- 
sed lips, then nodded. “You may 
have a valuable point there, my 
boy; we Terrans are a. versatile 
breed. Speaking of which, I wish 
you’d been there to see my hand- 
ling of the negotiation this morning! 
One moment I was all fire and 
truculence; the next, as smooth as 
Yill silk.”

IF 




“A brilliant performance, 1 uarc- 
say, Mr. Ambassador.” 

“Yes, indeed,” Sheepshorn rubbed 
his hands together, chuckling. “In a 
sense. Relief, diplomacy itself might 
be thought of as a branch of show 
business, eh? Thus, these performers 
might be considered colleagues of 
a sort.” 

“True, but I wouldn’t mention it 
when they’re within earshot.” 

“Yes, it might go to their heads. 
Well, I’m off, Retief. My report on 
this morning’s work will become a 
classic study of Terran diplomatic 
subtlety.” 

He hurried away. A Gaspierre 



with heavy bifocal lenses edged up 
to Retief. 

“I’m with the Gaspierre Morning 
Exhalation/' he wheezed. “Is it true, 
sire, that you Terries can turn into 
fire-breathing dragons at will?” 

A second reporter closed in. “I 
heard you read minds,” he said. 
“And about this ability to walk 
through walls — ” 

“Just a minute, boys,” Retief held 
up a hand. “I wouldn’t want to be 
quoted on this of course, but just 
between you and me, here’s what 
actually happened, as soon as the 
Ambassador had looked into his 
crystal ball . .” END

Having two thousand inhabited 
planets to supervise, anybody

F or such a racket to come from 
the anteroom on the far side 
of the door which bore the discreet 
gold-lettered warning SUPERIN- 
TENDENT OF GALACTIC REC- 
ORDS was unprecedented. It was 
rare enough for anyone to raise his 
voice at all here on Galrex — its 
mile-square, mile-deep computer- 
banked halls made it the effective 
center of power for the entire Lens, 
and the sensation that history was 
looking over your shoulder inspired 
an awed hush. 

Right now, though, someone was 
actually shouting, so loudly that 
Superintendent Motice Bain could 
hear the words without activating his 
desk communicators. A man, almost 
hysterical, was crying out over and 
over. 



“But I must see him! Something 
must be done! The human race k 
in danger!” 

A crank? Frowning over the loo- 
facile explanation — for it woiikl 
take an incredibly persistent crank to 
get to the very peak of the Galrex 
hierarchy — Bain switched on the 
TV pickups and inspected the scene 
beyond the door. Three harassed 
androids and a half-frantic human 
aide were trying to quiet a wild- 
faced man in clothing that suggested 
he might hail from one of the 
Bondageworlds: a rough brown shirt 
and a black kilt with knee-boots. 
But he had black hair all over the 
place, a brush-stiff beard and bushy 
eyebrows, whereas the Bondsmen 
usually shaved their entire bodies. 

The human race in danger, hrr^

Bain quirked up the corners of his 
thin-lipped mouth and raised the 
gain on the communicators to full. 

"What is it Ivor?” he demanded 
of the aide in the anteroom. 

T here was a moment of shocked 
silence. Ivor broke it with an 
accusing exclamation. 

"Now see what you’ve done! 
You’ve interrupted Super-Galrex!” 
"That’s what I’ve been trying to 
do!” the bearded man bellowed, un- 
repentant. But this final stab of de- 
fiance was the most he could man- 
age; one more second, and he had 
subsided into a frightened half- 
cringe, matching Ivor’s own. 

"Well?” Bain rapped. 

"Sir, forgive the disturbance, but 
really we have done our best to 
prevent him . .” Ivor hesitated, 
wiping his forehead with the back 
of a nervous hand. "He’s a fanatic, 
sir, that’s all. I’ve sent for a medic, 
and we’ll get him to the hospital 
as quickly as we can.” 

"I’m not crazy, damn it!” the 
bearded man exploded. "And here 
are the figures to prove it!” He 
reached to the hip pocket of his 
kilt and flourished a sheaf of docu- 
ments under Ivor’s nose. 

"But the computers say you’re 
wrong,” Ivor countered, and added 
to Bain, "I’m extremely sorry, sir, 
but he’s got some notion in his head 
about the computers having been 
tampered with, to stop them giving 
the right answer to the problem he 
brought with him.” 

"One second.” Bain rubbed his 
chin, considering. "Ivor, am I to 
understand that this man has come 



all the way to Galrex especially to 
put a private problem?” 

"Yes, I have,” the bearded man 
declared. 

"Hmmm . That makes you un- 
usual, my friend. Star travel is ex- 
pensive, to begin with, and the hire 
of Galrex computers isn’t cheap 
either.” 

"But your facilities are supposed 
to be public property,” the bearded 
man snapped. "Anyone can use them 
if he wants!” 

"Granted, granted. In fact, though, 
planetary governments are our reg- 
ular customers. There’s nothing spe- 
cial about the computers here — we 
simply have more of them than any- 
one else in the galaxy, because of 
the immense quantities of data we 
have to process.” Out of the corner 
of his eye, Bain noted with hidden 
amusement Ivor’s astonishment at 
seeing Super-Galrex make light con- 
versation with an obvious fanatic. 
"So tell me why you needed to use 
our facilities, and not those available 
on any civilized planet, Mr. — ?” 

"Falkirk,” said the bearded man. 
The frenzy had gone out of him, to 
be replaced by exaggerated defer- 
ence. Ivor was apparently much im- 
pressed by that fact, but Bain had 
small respect for his aide’s ability 
to deal with human beings. He was 
good with computers, but he lacked 
insight. One glance should have told 
him that Falkirk was honestly angry, 
and therefore accessible to reason. 

"Go on,” he invited. 

Falkirk took a deep breath. 

"I had to come here, sir, because 
nowhere else could I obtain all the 
information likely to be required in

evaluating the solution. There are 
factors involved which cover nearly 
a dozen star-systems.” 

“A personal problem of virtually 
galactic scope?” Bain measured hu- 
morous skepticism into his voice. 
Ivor pounced on this return to some- 
thing like his chief’s normal be- 
haviour. 

“Yes, sir. You see, Falkirk has — ” 
“Shut up.” Bain reached a quick 
decision. “Bring Falkirk in here. I 
can spare him two minutes to con- 
vince me he’s not a crank, and 
twelve minutes more if he succeeds. 
Is that fair, Mr. Falkirk?” 

“Yes, sir!” said the bearded man, 
and dived for the door as it slid 
aside. 

^t'T^his will give you an idea of 
A the scale of the thing I’ve 
stumbled on,” he said as he perched 
gingerly on the edge of the chair 
facing Bain. He couldn’t quite meet 
the piercing gaze of the Superinten- 
dent, but glanced at him sidelong, 
seeming to pay more attention to 
the artificial view of grassy meadows 
and far blue mountains projected on 
the outside of the window behind 
the desk. 

He handed over the top page from 
his sheaf of documents, and Bain 
scanned it as he put some further 
questions. It was nothing but a table 
of figures, as well known to him as 
his own name. 

“Are you from one of the Bond- 
ageworlds, Mr. Falkirk?” 

“No, sir. Don’t be misled by these 
clothes. I had to hock my thermo- 
suits on Fenris to make up the 
balance of the fare here.” 



Approx, total of inhabited planets 
at present: 2x103. 

“Your professional background? 
Clearly, you’re an educated man, and 
you must have done moderately well 
in some highly skilled job to even 
consider bringing your problem here 
to Galrex.” 

Approx, human population at pre- 
sent: 2 . 1 x 10 ^ 2 ^ 

“Yes, sir. By training I’m a cosmo- 
archeologist.” 

Bain’s nape prickled ever so faint- 
ly. He read on — Approx, total of 
starships in service: 4.3x10"^. 

“You’re not a mathematician, 
then,” he suggested. 

Falkirk bridled. “Sir, there’s noth- 
ing wrong with the figures I’ve com- 
piled, in spite of the fact that the 
computers here refused to give me 
a rational solution — ” 

Average number in crew of ship: 

101 . 

That was as far as Bain could 
be bothered to read. He pushed the 
table of figures across the slick sur- 
face of the desk, and it skidded 
several inches in Falkirk’s direction. 

“Let me make an enlightened 
guess,” he said. “You’ve noted the 
occurrence of an event against 
which the odds appear inconceivably 
large. You feel it ought to be investi- 
gated. Am I correct?” 

With unconcealed respect, Fal- 
kirk stared at him. “Exactly, sir. But 
this is no ordinary event in any 
case, regardless of the actual odds 
. .” He nerved himself for the 
final plunge. 

“What would you say if you were 
told that the entire crew of one 
single interstellar ship had wound up 



32 



IF 




in positions of fantastic power and 
influence within a few years of their 
simultaneous decision to retire from 
space?” 

‘‘Interesting,” was all Bain allowed 
himself to say. “Your two minutes 
are nearly up. Give me a few more 
details, and I’ll decide whether you 
can have your extra time.” 

“Among them are the Premier of 
Nokomis, the Autarch of Ling, the 
richest man on Quetzal, the chief 
priest of the state religion on Thum- 
mim — ” 

“An impressive roster!” Bain 
broke in. “Very well, Mr. Falkirk, 
ni concede your sincerity, if nothing 
more. Now, from the beginning and 
in full, if you please — but stick to 
the point, because I am a very busy 
man.” 

W e’re so far from being the first 
intelligent inhabitants of the 
galaxy (Falkirk said) that there’s no 
shortage of subjects for investigation 
by cosmoarcheologists, even making 
allowance for the fact that it’s not 
a popular discipline, so funds for 
jobs like the study of relics on non- 
terrestrial planets are hard to come 
by. 

So you might think it silly of me 
to have decided right at the outset 
of my career that there was precise- 
ly one predecessor species I wanted 
to devote my life to: those who used 
to inhabit the world we call Gorgon. 

On the face of it, there wasn’t 
anything so remarkable about those 
creatures. Physically they must have 
had a great deal in common with 
us, so the biologists aren’t very in- 
terested, and they never achieved 



spaceflight, so the psychologists haw 
dismissed them as rather dull. What’s 
more, their entire body of relics was 
concentrated on a small island in 
Gorgon’s southern hemisphere, which 
argues that they were singularly un- 
enterprising. 

On the Other hand, when I was 
still in school I ran across a story 
about them. I can’t remember exact- 
ly where. But it fascinated me, even 
though it was no more than an ill- 
documented legend. According to the 
traditions, they’d developed as the 
final flowering of their culture a 
dynamic training technique whi(A 
would enable any remotely similar 
creature to get the optimum per- 
formance from its nervous system 
by bringing under conscious control 
the faculty we refer to as “luck”. 
I don’t know how this was supposed 
to be done — possibly by developing 
an intuitive awareness of the most 
probable course of large-scale events. 
And this, allegedly, was the root 
of their eventual downfall : uniformly 
fortunate, they bored themselves into 
extinction. 

Since this must have happened 
at least several centuries before we 
discovered a stardrive, you’ll ask how 
it is the legend got into circulation. 
Well, according to what I recall from 
this source — I wish I could locate it 
again! — the discoverer of Gorgon 
was one of the great pioneering 
starscouts, a man named Morgan 
Wade. Morgan — Gorgon: you see 
he gave the planet a name which 
rhymed with his own. 

Sorry, I’m digressing. The point 
is, this scout was supposed to have 
found a key to the dead race’s

methods among the relics they’d left. 
Of course, this was in the early 
days of space exploration, three or 
four hundred years back, and find- 
ing alien remains wasn’t the com- 
monplace event it later became. So 
he spent several months investigat- 
ing, and finally worked out the de- 
tails of this training technique of 
theirs. 

Whereupon he went home and 
quit spacing for good. He turned his 
attention to the acquisition of wealth 
and power, and in a few years he’d 
become one of the richest and most 
important men alive. True, you 
might argue this was sheer chance — 
a famous pioneering starscout, decid- 
ing to switch careers, would have 
a good deal in his favor to begin 
with; the prestige of his reputation, 
for example. 

Nonetheless, I’m certain there was 
more to it than shows on the sur- 
face, and here’s why. 

It had always been my intention 
to devote myself to the definitive 
study of the Gorgon remains. Dur- 
ing my early work in cosmoaoheol- 
ogy I saved as much as I possibly 
could from my salary, with the sole 
purpose of financing an independent 
expedition to Gorgon and settling 
this — this myth that haunted me, 
once and for all. 

I was • extremely worried that I 
might not achieve my goal, be- 
cause as you know Gorgon has been 
open for colonization for nearly half 
a century, and I had visions of some 
blockhead sitting a cement factory 
on top of the alien relics. So, as 
soon as I could afford it, I went 



out there to survey the ground and 
perhaps reserve the digging rights if 
I could find a helpful government 
official. 

What I found was so much worse 
than a mere cement factory I can 
hardly bring myself to think about 
it. 

About eight or nine years ago, a 
starship in distress broke from hy- 
per and had to put down on Gorgon 
for repairs. They came in on a 
southerly orbit, and the island with 
the relics was the easiest place for 
them to land. I imagine they were 
furious at failing to make the main 
colonial base, not that it would have 
made much difference to the length 
of their stay. For when they radioed 
the main base for some major spare 
part they needed, it turned out not 
to be in stock, and had to be flown 
in from another star-system. 

So — they waited. And it’s my 
belief that, having nothing better to 
do, they set about deciphering the 
records left by the vanished aliens. 
It had been done once already — 
perhaps they even found some notes 
left by Morgan Wade; I don’t know. 

What I do know is that a month 
or five weeks went by, and the spare 
part arrived and was flown out from 
^e colonial base, and away they 
went. 

Laying the entire island waste with 
their drive as they took off. 

I’ve been there. I’ve seen it. It 
haunts my dreams, and I wake up 
crying with rage and frustration. 
There’s nothing left now but a pile 
of calcined rubble on a bare plat- 
form of rock sticking out of the 
sea. I’m certain it wasn’t an accident,

IF 




though that’s what they tried to tell 
me on Gorgon. They maintained that 
the repairs must have been inade- 
quate; the engineers are supposed to 
have overlooked some fault more 
serious than the one they spotted. 
But this implies that the engineers 
were incompetent, and I’m just not 
buying that. Does an incompetent 
man almost immediately set himself 
up as the head of a private army 
on Brocken and overthrow the gov- 
ernment, becoming virtual dictator 
a few months later? 

That’s what happened to the chief 
engineer! 

I was so heartbroken at this ruin- 
ation of my lifelong ambitions that 
my first thought was this: I ought 
to make them pay for what I re- 
garded as an unforgivable crime. I 
had some vague notion of suing the 
crew for the value of the items 
they’d destroyed — I told one of the 
planetary councilmen that I could 
get a museum on Earth to certify a 
value for him, and though he per- 
sonally didn’t give a damn about 
alien relics he liked the idea of a 
windfall to the treasury. So he got 
the government to stake me the fare 
to the ship’s latest recorded port of 
call. 

Well, I caught up with her. Only 
to find that every last one of her 
crew who’d been aboard when she 
landed on Gorgon had done the 
same as Morgan Wade and quit 
space for good. 

Following their separate trails was 
naturally more difficult and more 
expensive. I was often tempted to 
give up and content myself with 
grubbing on some other planet after 



some far less interesting species than 
the Gorgon race, especially when the 
Gorgon government decided they 
were throwing good money after 
bad and withdrew the retainer they’d 
been paying me. Worse yet, the chief 
engineer had become dictator of 
Brocken, as I said, and thus put 
himself effectively beyond reach of 
a private suit against him; and the 
ship’s MO had joined the priestly 
hierarchy on Thummim, where he 
enjoyed legal immunity, and — 

But that was when I spotted the 
incredible coincidence. It defied be- 
lief that these crewmen, all from 
the same ship, none of whom had 
displayed any extraordinary talents 
hitherto, should turn out overnight 
to be great leaders. I stopped worry- 
ing about compensation for the dam- 
age they’d wantonly committed on 
Gorgon, and began to worry very 
hard indeed about their impact on 
the human race. If they’d become 
masters of whole planets within a 
couple of years of acquiring the Gor- 
gon secrets, what would they do 
next? They’d conquer the galaxy, 
separately or together — and if sep- 
arately, then the process of conquest 
was going to be indescribably dread- 
ful for us poor untalented victims! 

I spent everything I’d saved to 
finance my work on Gorgon. I ex- 
hausted what I’d accumulated by 
packing my expense claims against 
the Gorgon government. I bank- 
rupted myself with interstellar fares, 
got credit by sheer bluster and spent 
it and left for some other system 
just ahead of the law. I believe I’m 
wanted on at least three planets for 
dishonored debts. But I don’t care. 



AGAINST THE ODDS 



35 




What counts is that I’ve finally 
brought my discovery to someone 
in a position to act against these — 
these exploiters of ordinary human- 
ity! 

B ain grunted. “I see. You’ve listed 
these former spacemen, have 
you?” 

“Yes, I have full details of their 
recent careers right here, and what 
little 1 could pick up about their 
earlier lives. They seem to be cov- 
ering their tracks deliberately, get- 
ting rid of as many existing records 
as—” 

Bain snapped his fingers impatient- 
ly. “Don’t waste time talking about 
it — let me read for myself.” 

“I’m sorry,” Falkirk apologized 
sheepishly, and handed over the rest 
of his fat bundle of documents. 

When Bain had been silent for a 
good half-minute, he could endure 
the waiting no longer. He forced 
out, “Well, Mr. Bain, what do you 
think?” 

“I think it’s a pity you weren’t 
given a full mathematical education,” 
Bain muttered, turning up the last 
of the many pages before him. 
“What? But—!” 

“Mr. Falkirk,” Bain said with 
great deliberation, “you’ve submitted 
these findings for computer analysis, 
haven’t you?” 

“Yes.” Falkirk’s voice dropped 
almost to a whisper. “But I’m con- 
vinced someone got to the computers 
first. Because the results I got were 
ridiculous^ 

“Just a second.” Bain raised a 
hand. “What you hoped for, I im- 
agine, was that the computers would 



pump out some astronomically long 
odds, and you’d be able to approach 
me with this as proof of the reality 
of the secrets found on Gorgon: 
correct?” 

“Why, yes. But — ” 

“Now here we have the odds as 
calculated by the computers,” Bain 
continued imperturbably. “Naturally, 
using the unique memory banks here 
at Galrex, they did a far more 
thorough analysis than any unaided 
individual — with all respect to your- 
self, Mr. Falkirk. And I see the 
print-out reads 402,962 over 861,304 

— in round numbers, about eight- 
seventeenths.” 

“Yes!” Falkirk was beside him- 
self with excitement. “And that’s 
obviously absurd, because — ” 

“Please!” Bain said sharply. “Mr. 
Falkirk, where do you come from 
originally?” 

“From Isis, but I don’t sec 
what — ” 

“You will. On Isis, if I recall 
right, they still adhere to the an- 
cient tradition of celebrating birth- 
days, don’t they?” 

“As a matter of fact, they do, 
but — ” 

“Counting Year Day, there are 
365 days in a standard year. Sup- 
pose you have two dozen people 
in a room : what are the odds 

against two of them, or more, shar- 
ing their birthdays?” 

Falkirk put his hand to his fore- 
head. If Bain hadn’t been Super- 
Galrex, doubtless he’d have refused 
to waste time on such a jejune ques- 
tion. With great effort he muttered, 
“Oh . Twenty-four, two twelves 

— call it thirty-six, three twelves. 



36 



IF 




times ten . two out of thirty . 
About fifteen to one!” 

Bain shoc^ his head heavily. “It 
is a pity you weren’t trained as a 
mathematician. The actual odds are 
rf>out 27 over 50, or better than 
evens.” 

“They can’t be,” Falkirk said, 
staring. “If there are 365 days in 
a year — ” 

“There’s one chance in 365 that 
a given person’s birthday will coin- 
cide with someone else’s. For every 
additional person the odds against 
coincidence reduce by one; when 
you get to the two-dozenth person 
it’s down to 342. Now multiply all 
your fractions together — 364 over 
365, 363 over 365, and so on down 
to 342 — and cancel. When you’ve 
done that, you’ll find that there re- 
main only about 23 chances out of 
50 that the next person you try will 
have a birthday not already on your 
list. I’m sorry, but there it is. You 
find it equally extraordinary that out 
of the entire population of the galaxy 
ten men should suddenly and simul- 
taneously prove to be great states- 
men, leaders, business wizards — but 
that’s because you’re making an in- 
tuitive assessment, nothing better 
than a guess. Examining the situation 
rationally, the computers have con- 
tradicted you.” 

“But how?” Falkirk demanded. 
“How can this be true?” 

B ain sighed. “Look, Mr. Falkirk, 
suppose you ring for a cab, and 
cab license number 1 turns up. You’d 
say how remarkable that was, but 
this is nonsense. It was a sheer 
damned certainty that a cab would 



turn up — excluding breakdowns and 
so forth, naturally. In precisely the 
same way, you mustn’t only consider 
factors like the galactic population 
and the number of ships a-space 
when working out your problem. 
You have to figure in the compen- 
sating factors that go the other way, 
such as that at any given time it’s 
a hundred per cent certain somebody 
will be top dog on each of our two 
thousand-plus planets. Is it any more 
surprising that the dictator of Brock- 
en should be an ex-spaceman than 
that — well, that I, out of two times 
ten to the twelfth living people, 
should sit in this chair?” 

“Yes, but every last one of the 
crew . .” 

Doubt was creeping into Falkirk’s 
voice now. Sensing it, Bain leaned 
forward to hammer his point home. 

“Mr. Falkirk, I do sympathize 
with you. I recognize your sincerity 
— but for that. I’d not have accorded 
you so much of my time, which is 
rather valuable. Believe me, though, 
you’ve fallen into an elementary trap 
which must be over a thousand years 
old.” 

“What am I going to do?” whis- 
pered Falkirk brokenly. 

“If you want my advice, you’d 
best forget all about this obsession of 
yours and go back to cosmoarcheol- 
ogy. There are too few good men in 
that field to waste someone with 
your persistence and drive — and 
who can say? Maybe you’ll turn up 
something as interesting as these 
‘Gorgon secrets’.” 

“Yes, but I have no money, and 
I told you I’m wanted for debt on 
at least three planets!” 



AGAINST THE ODDS

"Mr. Falkirk,” Bain said frigidly, 
"Fm afraid that’s trouble you’ve 
brought on your own head. You can 
hardly expect me to set things right 
for you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, 
I have a lot of work to do.” 

Head bowed, moving like a man 
in a daze, Falkirk rose numbly and 
went out, not bothering to reclaim 
the precious sheaf of documents on 
which he’d based his belief in a 
threat to the human race. Bain 
gathered them together, and once 
more his thin mouth quirked into a 
smile. 

"Sir, the way you handled Falkirk 
was magnificent!” Ivor purred from 
the desk communicator. "He’s walk- 
ed off as meek as a lamb!” 

"Hm? Oh yes. I was going to tick 
you off about that, Ivor. You should 
have reasoned with him, not tried 
to throw him out. He was well- 
meaning enough, and if his thinking 
had been a bit less confused he 
might even have had a valid point. 
Now shut up and don’t disturb me 
till I say so.” 

"Yes, sir,” Ivor muttered, and the 
communicator fell silent. 

As it was, of course, Bain reflect- 
ed, Falkirk had overlooked the valid 
point completely. He punched for 
a circuit to master computer control, 
and uttered crisp orders. 

"Get me all available data on the 
following persons! The new dictator 
of Brocken; the high priest on Thum- 
mim; the Autarch of Ling; the Pre- 
mier of Nokomis . .” 

Doing well, considering. But they’d 
never do any better, because the 
odds against them were too great. 



One against ten, to be precise. In- 
surmountable odds, when you figur- 
ed in the crucial factor of control of 
Galrex. 

"The data are extensive. Super- 
intendent,” the machine said with 
sweet mechanical regret. "They will 
take about five minutes to print out 
in full.” 

"I can wait,” Bain grunted. He 
looked around the office, absorbing 
the aura of power it breathed. Yes, 
he’d been right from the very begin- 
ning — he’d realized, even before 
leaving Gorgon, that in Galrex lay 
the key to the entire Lens. It had 
taken him a long time to get here, 
but that was of no consequence. 
Among the other achievements of 
the race that formerly inhabited 
Gorgon, they’d extended their mental 
control of probability to the maximi- 
zation of individual lifespans. 

And he’d done nothing so crude 
as destroying the alien relics — why, 
that misguided action had been so 
conspicuous, an idiot like Falkirk had 
come within an ace of explaining 
the reason for it! 

Though, as was inevitable, he’d 
brought his discovery to the person 
uniquely fitted to explain it away 
again . 

Bain pursed his lips. He’d been 
worried for two centuries that some- 
one might connect him and Morgan 
Wade. It had finally happened, and 
here he was, safe and sound. Really, 
they must have been amazing crea- 
tures, there on Gorgon! It looked as 
though it would take him another 
century to get really used to what 
he’d learned from them. END

Of Men

He hunted the most deadly 
prey on Earth — the men 
who long ago had ruled HI 



I 

A movement high on the wall 
caught his eye, and Edmond 
Reud pushed back the hair that 
usually protected him from the sun, 
but which was now a danger to his 
vision. 

Face and hands smeared the same 
ochre color as the sky, a man 
leaped from the wall with a rusty 
blade. Edmond sent a crossbow reed 



low, into the belly of the 
scalper, and the wounded body 
whistled by. Dust rose even to where 
Edmond was sitting on his whudey. 
The whudey sneezed. 

Another reed sang from Edmond’s 
crossbow, piercing the fallen man 
in the throat. 

The whudey grunted when Ed- 
mond dismounted, but was patient 
as he bent over and cut around the 
hair-line of the corpse. After a tug 



39 



and a rip, the scalp came free and 
Edmond sprinkled sand across its 
bloody side. 

That makes five, which means fifty 
pellets on exchange, Edmond mused 
as he tucked the hair into a bulg- 
ing pouch. 

On the horizon behind him rose 
the Minced Mountain and its metal 
stalk which seemed to hold up the 
sky. To his left were barren moun- 
tains on which the sky merely rest- 
ed, and to the right, rose jagged 
peaks. 

At that moment the inexplicable 
mind-prickling began to plague him 
again. Edmond groaned, but looked 
toward the city and the pellets for 
which he would soon feel a need. 
Ahead, sandblasted and emaciated, 
but still succeeding in holding the 
mouth of the subterranean city open, 
towered two walls, which gradually 
sank into the sand and left a gaping 
hole for anyone who would enter the 
city. Although the darkness seemed 
menacing, Edmond Reud knew it 
was actually the safest place in the 
world. 

Part of it was respect for fair 
play and humanity that kept men 
from scalping each other in the city 
itself. The city was a safety zone — 
the only safety zone. In one of its 
sand and dirt rooms sat an Ex- 
changer with the pellets, the stimuli 
that made rhen hunt each other. 

Sure, there were a few who tried 
to violate safety respect in the city, 
but they ended up facing the anger 
of tveryone there, instead of just 
one man, as they would outside. 
The odds were better outside in the 
sun. 



I n the stables the whudey whined 
in fear of being left alone. Ed- 
mond gave it a rough pat and a back 
scratch, but continued on foot in the 
direction of his room. 

He passed through the darkness 
into the strangely lighted chambers, 
and passageways, the crossbow 
dangling on his fingertips. Why take 
chances? You learned that it was 
better to be pessimistic and end con- 
tented if nothing happened, than op- 
timistic and very disappointed if 
something did. 

Edmond squinted at the crudely 
lettered sign at the fork in the cor- 
ridor, and glanced at the arrows 
pointing to the respective rooms. 
Ernev, Bob, Rundal. Some names 
had been taken down. The owners 
were, no doubt, lying bleached in 
the sun somewhere. 

It had been a long time since he 
had last been to the city. He had 
left enough food and pellets for 
Cathy, but he feared he knew she 
wouldn’t be waiting in his room. 
She wouldn’t have left on her own, 
but there were other men with that 
certain pellet wealth that appealed 
to Cathy. 

His room was empty. It had been 
empty a long time, for cobwebs 
rounded off the corners of the wood- 
beam ceiling. ‘T’m sorry,” began the 
message scribbled on the doorbeam. 
“But I thought you might be dead. 
God bless you. Love, Cathy.” Ed- 
mond laughed aloud, but the laugh 
kind of hurt his ears. That was 
Cathy, all right. He wanted to laugh 
again, but it just didn’t come out. 

No reason for him to stay 
around. Best get rid of the scalps

and head for the sun again. And 
hope the mind-prickling didn’t re- 
sume its fury. 

Exchange the scalps . Edmond 
was beginning to pant heavily, and 
his muscles ached. He was already 
beginning to need the pellets. 

‘‘Scalps,” said the usual sign on 
the usual doorway of the room where 
light streamed from the usual crys- 
tal and metal object on the wall, il- 
luminating the usual Exchanger. 

A larger sign at the man’s feet 
shouted: “Women: 20. Men: 10.” 
The exchange for a female scalp 
has risen ten pellets. Some men 
would find it in them to collect . 
but Edmond had never wanted to 
try it. Respect again . 

Cross-legged, the palid Exchanger 
sat in a trance. Edmond pulled out 
his pouch, spread the clumps of hair 
across the sand floor, and waited. 

When he slipped back to reality, 
the Exchanger glanced down and in 
two smooth motions swept up the 
scalps and handed Edmond two 
handfuls of pellets. Edmond looked 
into his eyes: often he had felt him- 
self hating this man, but respect for 
the safety zone had prevented him 
from killing and taking all the pel- 
lets. A fear of not being able to ob- 
tain pellets later on entered into his 
restraint also, he realized. 

One last backward glance as Ed- 
mond left the room showed him the 
Exchi'ingcr opening his mouth slowly 
and in it placing a large oblong 
pellet that looked impossible to 
swallow. 

Edmond had never thought of a 
second kind of pellet existing, but 
tile Exchanger had just taken one.

Some human colonists are trapped 
under charge field with Judicians. 
We believe all Judician weapons on

and Judicians are a physically weak 
race so Judicians should not be any 
great threat to Tinni colonists in

they may be killing humans we do

cue Tinni colonists. Politics says we 
must rescue them or else.

T he whudey nuzzled its flared 
nose into the hot sand, shifting 



its weight on heavy feet and scratch- 
ing its rump on a cactus-reed leaf. 
It then emitted a sigh of pleasure. 

Edmond awoke from his comfort- 
able position on the slope of the 
animal’s largest hump and imme- 
diately grew aware of the prickling 
inside his cranium. It made him want 
to scream, but he recognized it, 
and remembered with annoyance 
and a little terror that this was just 
the beginning. The mild part. 

He just didn’t understand this 
thing in his head. The prickling had 
occurred over a dozen times before, 
always growing softer as he neared 
the Minced Mountain and the metal 
stalk. After a few days of soothing 
sensation, the feeling had always 
stopped, allowing Edmond to resume 
his search for men and their scalps. 

Edmond echoed the sigh of the 
whudey. This meant that he would 
have to go back to the Mountain 
and bear the whole process once 
again. But first — 

He dropped from the equinine 
camel and slashed with a rusty blade 
at the reeds that had sheltered him 
from observation the night before. 

Slicing off the pulpy, thorned 
leaves, he gathered the bare stems 
into a bundle, and resumed his 
perch on the whudey. The shaping 
of new reeds should kill enough time 
to* take the monotony from the trip 
ahead. 

Besides the city, the next safest 
place was the mid-desert, where you 
could survey 150 square kilometers 
and no human movement could es- 
cape you. Any would-be scalper 
would be noticed far enough ahead 
for time to shoot some food, roast it

over a fire and shape any reeds you 
might need when he finally did ar- 
rive. Edmond laughed. If you want- 
ed to live a life of sun and safety, 
dig a hole or erect a tent right where 
he was. That is, if you didn’t need 
the pellets in the city; and Edmond 
doubted that anyone didn’t need the 
pellets sometime. 

Wincing at the thought of no 
pellets, Edmond remembered the 
violent spasms that had hit him when 
he had waited too long without 
them. 

The prickling continued and Ed- 
mond found himself automatically 
scratching his head as if for fleas. 
Everything was becoming more and 
more incomprehensible as the days 
passed. Especially his memory: it 
was as if he had been born with 
plush facial hair — his memory ex- 
tended back no further than that. 

The more he thought about it 
consciously, the more Edmond 
found that something had drained 
importance from his life. There was 
constant depression — perhaps be- 
cause there was no memory of a 
past life on which to base the de- 
grees of happiness. Or was the de- 
pression merely from his lack of 
understanding of the world? 

No significance to life ... ex- 
cept a pride in that respect for fair- 
I^ay in most men. Respect that did 
not belong to a degenerate world of 
blood and pellets. 

Perhaps he didn’t belong either — 
he had that respect. 

S wishing its forked tail to ward off 
insects that had accompanied 
it from the city, the whudey began 



to blink in a twitch. It gazed out 
across the desert. Edmond rose in 
the slick saddle and observed that 
his whudey stood on the border 
between a barren land peppered with 
individual weeds and plants, and 
that hypnotic world of animated 
sands. 

Like the whudey, Edmond wanted 
to blink the sandy inferno away; but 
it was there with him, as were the 
innumerable pins under his skull. 
He felt like splitting open his cran- 
ium and scratching. 

The whudey half trotted, half 
loped toward the large speck that 
called Edmond to the horizon. 

The area around the well was quite 
exposed from attack from the near- 
by rocks, but both man and beast 
needed water. This time, Edmond 
had to be optimistic. 

He again parted the hair hanging 
in his face and stared into the water- 
hole. It was too narrow, too smooth 
and deep to have been dug by 
shovels, and it looked old. A glance 
at the well caused Edmond to think 
of the sky that seemed to rest on the 
mountains, but he dismissed the as- 
sociation for its pointlessness. 

If he could only remember back, 
things would be clear. 

Having pulled the twin water bags 
from the whudey’s lower hump, he 
lowered them simultaneously into 
the well and awaited the splash. 

When it did come, so did a human 
shadow to his right. 

Fool! he shouted silently to him- 
self. So busy meditating, he hadn’t 
even bothered keeping the crossbow 
beside him. 

Edmond pretended not to see the 



IP 




figure watching him, and through 
peripheral vision searched for an 
opportune position for a dash to 
the saddle. He felt foolish. If his 
would-be scalper had a knife, he 
would throw it; with a crossbow, 
he would get Edmond no matter 
what. A knife, Edmond hoped. 

The buzzing of a thousand insects 
made Edmond unconsciously look 
to the right. The advancing scalper 
had also stopped and turned in the 
direction of the sound: 

Behind the scalper a flat metal 
circle skipped across the dunes, and 
dipped toward him. It couldn’t be 
possible, but Edmond thought he 
could see the Exchanger’s face on 
the circle — which was now resem- 
bling a platform — and beside it an- 
other face, gray, unfamiliar. 

The passengers of the flying plat- 
form saw the scalper without notic- 
ing Edmond, who flattened himself 
behind the scattered rocks around 
the well. The platform dipped again 
and flashed by the dumbfounded 
scalper. The rim of its floor struck 
his head, and he staggered, falling. 
One temple began to shine red in the 
sun. 

After a last dip for inspection of 
the lifeless human, the platform was 
gone. 

Ill 

T here had never been death like 
that before: machine against 
man, and Edmond tried to shake it 
away with a shiver of his shoulders. 
There had been no battle at all — ^but 
a man had been killed. In such mur- 
der there was no respect for equal 



opportunity, no respect for Man the 
Fighter. 

And Edmond knew the platform 
would have killed him, too, had it 
seen him. 

Freeing the body of its scalp was 
messy and slow for Edmond. A 
sloppy job; Edmond realized he was 
disturbed by small nagging notions 
in his head. Too m^ny confusing 
things were happening lately. The 
platform, the grayish figure beside 
the Exchanger, the metal stalk, the 
Minced Mountain, no memory. He 
developed a quick headache. 

Thank God it wasn’t the windy 
season, he sighed, starting to scale 
the infinity of boulders — ^the pieces 
of the shattered mountain called 
Minced Mountain. 

Edmond Reud craned his neck 
up the 300 meters of rocks and up 
the other 300 meters of metal pole. 
Both mountain and pole didn’t be- 
long here. They had not been born 
with the land; and, with more con- 
fusion, they attached themselves 
to his mind in association with the 
flying platform that had seemed to 
be traveling from the city in the 
direction of the Mountain. 

The prickling had waned slightly 
with each step up the mountain. By 
now it was soft and satisfying, but 
Edmond wasn’t satisfied. 

It would take him at least ten 
days to search the shadows of the 
boulders for whatever was calling 
him with the prickling and whisper- 
ing in his head. But assuming that 
the closer he got to it, the more 
soothing the prickling would be- 
come, the search would neither be 
impossible nor unbearable.

The whudey would not accompany 
him. Edmond would have to find a 
place for it and hope the animal 
didn’t snort and betray itself if any- 
one came near. 

No — something besides hope 
could be done about the snorting. 

An oblong boulder rested on a low 
cliff and another long towering rock, 
forming a natural stall. Edmond led 
the reluctant animal into the crag’s 
darkness, allowed the whudey five 
drinks of water, and then tied a 
piece of rivul skin around its head 
loosely, but so that it would permit 
no braying or wheezing. The whudey 
stood quietly, completely subdued; 
Edmond gave it a reassuring pat be- 
tween its silky ears. 

Edmond started and stared at 
the water bags. He hadn’t noticed 
that before ... or had he? The two 
bags were not animal skin, and what 
they were, he didn’t know. He sigh- 
ed a second time, as he realized that 
as the metal platform associated 
itself with the Minced Mountain in 
his mind, so did these water holders 
— which were blue, slick and easily 
wrinkled — associate themselves with 
the city, the metal and crystal city 
lights, and human beings. 

Two categories of life seemed to 
be forming in his mind. 

Logic told him that whatever 
called him . at intervals was not nat- 
ural, so he wondered to himself 
what it would associate itself with 
when and if he finally reached it. He 
made its discovery his goal — some- 
thing important to life — even 
though he was tired of the whole 
situation; and he made curiosity his 
stimulus. 



Since there was no wind to erase 
his footprints, he tore a large brush 
from a crevace and swished it in 
a fury on the ground at the mouth 
of the whudey’s “stall” and across 
his own tracks as he proceeded to- 
ward his goal. 

On the rocks he would have no 
worry of being tracked . 

N o worry of being tracked, un- 
less, as he realized after a few 
hours of scrambling and frequent 
slipping, he left a trail of blood. 
With knuckles torn and screaming 
quietly in agony from repetitious 
scrapings, Edmond strove toward 
the sky, noticing an ever so slight 
change in the sensation on his brain. 
Were there any others being called 
to this place, or was he alone? If 
there were, they would be trying to 
stay hidden from his vision, so he 
shouldn’t expect to see anyone in 
any case. 

Edmond fumbled. His crossbow 
clattered against the gray rock; a 
few reeds rolled out and fell down 
the slope. He swore and for the 
first time allowed himself to stand 
and to stretch, a perfect target for 
any weapon nearby. He just could 
not go on without breaking the mo- 
notony for his legs and back. 

The pole glittered above him. Ed- 
mond couldn’t analyze his deduction 
logically, but his eyes told him 
that the pole touched the “sky” as 
did the mountains to the east and 
west. Perhaps it was the minute 
dark tops that made it seem so. 

Whatever it was, Edmond felt 
trapped on earth. Mixed emotions 
flashed over him with each attempt 



46 



IF 




deep thought, so he did as little 
as possible. 

When he closed his eyes, he could 
still see the ominous boulders around 
him. This was a new inferno of gray 
and the bleached and the yellow- 
white heat of the sky. 

Four days had passed, and noth- 
ing .. Cut and festering hands 
and shins took all annoyance from 
the dust that covered his skin. 

With a groan he stretched again, 
and then stopped. An inky darkness 
different from the usual gray shad- 
ows stared at him ten meters 
away. 

Darkness meant depth, and depth 
was seclusion and mystery. His 
hopes were increased as the mind- 
prickling decreased even more. 

Half falling, he rushed into the 
mouth of the cave, and cried out 
as he almost collided with a man 
seated on the floor. Edmond stared, 
heart sounding in his ears. The man’s 
leg was bent at an incredible angle, 
and what of the man’s skin that 
could be seen through caked dirt 
was pale and creased. Edmond had 
seen similar skin once before. Pale 
and wrinkled from need of pellets. 

XTormaJly Edmond would have 
killed the man automatically, 
but he was not out on the desert 
now; he was in the unnatural Minc- 
ed Mountain, and he found it easier 
to ally himself with the cripple than 
with his environment. 

Neither spoke. The man on the 
floor probably awaited death at Ed- 
mond’s hands. Edmond awaited an 
explanation. 

Rows of small metal containers on 



wooden shelves stretcher back into 
the cave. Edmond again sensed that 
these were related to the city and 
not to the flying platform. 

Confusion was mounting — with 
frustration, and impatience. 

“I’m not going to kill you,” Ed- 
mond said, then felt the absurdity 
of the statement. 

The man’s face upturned. His 
snarled hair and beard were graying. 
Lord, he was old, Edmond realized 
with a start. Edmond had only seen 
one Other old man before, a thou- 
sand or more days before, the body 
lying dehydrated and scalped in the 
desert. 

“Speak. What is all this?” Again 
his words sounded foolish, but his 
words could only echo his thoughts. 
One seldom found occasion to talk 
these days. These days? Had there 
been time before when one had 
found occasion to talk a lot? 

The old man was quiet, staring 
at Edmond. 

“Sit down,” he finally command- 
ed tiredly, and Edmond did so, ly- 
ing his crossbow aside without hesi- 
tation. “You really want to know? 
You are curious?” 

Edmond nodded. 

The old man mumbled something 
about hope, and sighed. “Then I 
will tell you and you will have to 
listen long. There’s a lot to say. But 
since you want to know ...” 

Edmond awaited, finding himself 
momentarily envisioning the old 
man, Edmond himself and the whole 
situation a bit insane. The old man 
whispered to himself, seeming to 
chose and arrange the words he 
would use. Edmond wanted to scream

at him to hurry and say something, 
anything, to break the craziness of 
the moment. 

IV 

44T am, I think, Richard Cordaro. 

X My leg,” the old man said, 
stroking it as if it were a separate 
animal, “was broken badly and it’s 
been this way for I don’t know how 
many hundred days. I fell into the 
cave from a scuffle on the rocks 
above the cave’s opening. It was 
the second guy who tried to kill me 
while I had been in the cave. You’ll 
find their skeletons somewhere out- 
side, and their animals’ somewhere, 
too. Probably starved to death,” The 
old man was almost babbling. “I 
can only crawl and I can barely 
even talk. I’ve wanted to talk so 
much, but no one to talk to all that 
time. I remember I came here be- 
cause something called me in my 
head.” 

As Edmond’s eyes jerked in rec- 
ognition, the old man nodded heav- 
ily. “I thought that is why you’re 
here, too. Later we might talk about 
what calls us here. We have time.” 
He cleared his throat, and resumed. 
“Since there was nothing for me to 
lean on to get out, I haven’t left, 
but nor do I want to.” 

The old man gestured at the 
metal containers. “I have all the food 
and water I need. Brought them 
here from a storage room in the 
city. So much stuff in that room, but 
I broke my leg and got stranded 
here before I could bring it all here, 
to my home, the place that calls me 
so much.” Trying to pull himself 



along, the old man began to move 
toward the shelves. 

Scrambling to his feet, Edmond 
motioned him to stay still. He felt 
a new respect — or a pity — for this 
man named Cordaro. “Do you want 
some of the containers?” Edmond 
asked. 

The old man nodded again. 

It looked like water in the crystal 
containers, Edmond observed as he 
sat metal and crystal ones down 
before Richard Cordaro, who pulled 
a rusty metal thing from a cranny 
in the wall. This new metal thing 
was related to the containers and 
the city, came the immediate analy- 
sis from Edmond’s subconscious. 

With a few jerky motions from 
the old man’s hand, one of the metal 
containers was opened and wonder- 
ful odors hit Edmond in the face. 

“Go on — have some,” Cordaro 
said. “There’s enough for an army 
here.” He shoved the container to- 
ward Edmond, who wrinkled his 
nose and stuck his fingers into the 
food. The moisture of the stuff was 
pleasantly cool to his mouth. 

With food floating in his jowls, 
Edmond still managed to blurt, 
“You do have food and water, but 
how do you get any pellets. How 
long have you lacked them? I have 
some if you need — ” 

“God no!” the old man interrupt- 
ed. “Let me go on explaining. No 
more pellets, ever! I — ” 

“But look what’s happening to 
your — ” 

The old man interrupted again, 
“I asked you to let me go on.” 

Edmond was silent. 

“I have a bad memory.” 



48 



IF 




Again Edmond started, but said 
nothing. 

C4T have a bad memory, but I 
X can remember everything that 
has happened to me since I stopped 
swallowing the pellets, a long time 
ago, many memories ago. The pain 
of no pellets was bad for twenty 
days, but it left . You can’t re- 
member that far back for yourself. 
But then you have been eating the 
pellets; they have everything to do 
with a man’s memory.” Cordaro 
stared into Edmond’s face. 

“And I think it is because I 
haven’t had the pellets that I can 
remember faint things that happen- 
ed before I first took the pellets. 
I’ve written those feelings and mem- 
ories down on the racks I built 
to hold up the food.” He pointed 
to a wooden board holding up the 
shelves. “Would you mind reading 
them to me, and to yourself?” 

As Edmond neared the inscrip- 
tions, he saw they were numbered. 
“Number one: ‘There is something 
wrong in the world, for there are 
no flying animals in the sky.’ ” 
“Stop,” Cordaro motioned to him. 
“Have you noticed that?” 

After a thought back into what 
of his life he could remember, Ed- 
mond agreed. “Yes, I suppose. The 
only one I did see, fell to pieces 
when it flew too high. It hit the 
sky . .” 

The old man smiled for the first 
time. “It hit the sky. The sky is 
very close; you’ve noticed that, too. 
Read the next one.” 

“ ‘There is something wrong in 
the world, because my mind tells me 



that at night there should be moons 
and stars in the sky.’ ” Edmond’s 
mouth fell open slightly. “Stars” 
and “moons.” As soon as the two 
new words appeared in his mind, he 
knew the statement was correct. 
“Go on,” Cordaro said. 

“‘There is something wrong in the 
world, because my mind tells me 
that someone is trying to get into 
the world.’ ” Edmond had never 
felt that; he read on, “Number four: 
‘There is something very wrong, be- 
cause my mind tells me sqmeone is 
trying to kill all men in the world.’ ” 
Edmond stopped himself. “Of 
course!” he announced in a frus- 
trated voice. “Men are trying to kill 
men.” 

“Yes, but why?” coached the old 
man. 

“For pellets. They’re a necessity.” 
“Not to me.” 

“But the pain, and your skin . .” 
“I have no pain now. The pellets 
are a habit out of men’s weak- 
nesses.” Cordaro closed his eyes to 
think. “And as you yourself know, 
the pellets hurt your memory.” 
Edmond read on without urging: 
“‘There is something wrong in the 
world, for my mind tells me that 
men shouldn’t forget things as they 
do.’” 

A ll at once these new revelations 
were too much for Edmond’s 
brain. He sank to the floor and put 
his face in his hands. 

“You don’t have to accept it all,” 
said the old man. “But don’t dis- 
card it all, either. Try to fit it into 
your own logic and observations. 
And please listen to the next two

49 




words with all you have.” Richard 
Cordaro then proceeded to succinctly 
pronounce: ‘‘Beautiful women.” 

A feeling of contentment and ap- 
preciation followed as Edmond heard 
the two words. He told Cordaro his 
emotions. 

“Your feelings about women are 
mine,” Cordaro remarked. “But re- 
member the sign in the city tells us 
to kill them for pellets. Our happi- 
ness and contentment at the thought 
of women cannot be a freak of 
opinion and thought, so most men 
must feel the way we do. And still 
the sign says kill women! The Ex- 
changers are men, so basically they 
must feel as we do. There must be 
something behind the Exchangers, 
scalps and pellets, which is not 
Man.” 

Edmond discovered himself think- 
ing, for the first time in his mem- 
ory. “You’re assuming too much,” 
he objected. “You’re not being logi- 
cal because you just dismissed the 
possibility of the two of us being 
freaks. Aren’t we the only ones be- 
ing called to the mountain. That’s 
freakish. And you can’t dismiss the 
possibility of the Exchangers being 
freaks either.” 

“I see the reasoning in your ar- 
guments. My ‘logic* is based mostly 
on memory feelings, and I’ll have 
to be shown one way or another 
that we, and not the pellet-bounties 
offered on scalps, are freaks to this 
world, before I’ll abandon my feel- 
ings. I know of men who have kill- 
ed women for the pellets, men who 
would rather do that than bear pain, 
but still they’ve had good feelings 
deep inside for women. They are 



merely men without respect and 
pride, I think.” The old man was 
calm; he seemed tired. 

It gradually sank into Edmond. 
Respect again and again. “Yes . 
I won’t forget that, no matter what 
else the pellets make me forget. I 
will remember the respect.** Ed- 
mond started to move toward the 
outside, “I’ll have to return to the 
city before I can have any peace in 
my mind. I want understanding.” 

“A minute, please . your name?” 
Cordaro asked. 

“Edmond Reud.” 

“Edmond, go to the writing on 
the shelves again, and read the two 
columns of words you missed. Cov- 
er the right-hand column with your 
hand, read the left-column words to 
yourself, and then read the right 
column.” 

“Tinni,” Edmond read to him- 
self. He had never heard the word 
before — never before in what life 
he could remember, so he could not 
know what it meant. But the word 
“Tinni” made him feel proud and 
close to whatever Tinni was. Ed- 
mond looked at the right-hand col- 
umn. 

E ight words were etched there: 
“The feeling of being near and 
dear.” Exactly what Edmond had 
felt. He closed his eyes; the old man, 
he concluded, was right about the 
wrongness of loss of memory. 

The next word, or two words, was 
“Earth-Terra”. “Earth” brought 
nothing, but “Terra” filled Edmond’s 
mind with the memory sensation of 
something far away, watching him 
always, somehow. 



50 



IF 




The corresponding sentence in the 
right-hand column said: “Far away, 
but important.” 

The third word: “Starship.” An 
admiration - pride - fear - awe - joy 
slapped him immediately across the 
brain, and the corresponding sen- 
tence turned out to be the words 
“Pride and Power”. 

The last word — no, there were 
eight words. Edmond’s heart rocked 
inside his chest. It kicked and push- 
ed him. The words were: “Death of 
Tinni and all men on Tinni.” 

With a cry, he collapsed and 
moaned. Depression-honor-sense-of- 
immediacy-futility-terror swept over 
him, flogging him. 

Edmond was panting when he 
finally rose and stared at the old 
man — the prophet, the wizard of 
words. Edmond understood what 
Tinni was; he looked at the right 
column, which said accordingly and 
appropriately: “More terrible to me 
than even my own death.” 

“I hope I haven’t given you too 
much,” the old man said. “As I said 
before, something is wrong in this 
world of ours. Hold tight.” 

“I’m going back to the city to 
find the Exchanger. I’ll do some- 
thing.” 

“You’ll do something,” Cordaro 
mused, “for curiosity. It is so for 
me also. And also for something 
more than curiosity . 

“Out of respect for men in our 
world,” Edmond said. 

“It seems so. I want to know 
what is happening in the world, be- 
cause I have nothing else to do. I 
cannot move, to scalp, and take 
pellets, as other men do.” 



“1 want to know what is happen- 
ing,” Edmond returned, “because I 
have nothing else to do except scalp 
and take pellets, as other men do.”

way. Say little at all. Urgent. Bureau 
is debating whether to support the 
dismantling of the action dept. Our

To Crux Orbit 1 Terra: Check. 
To Base Roquefort Orbit 24 Tin- 
ni: Double check it damn! 

To Bureau of MWU Ship Trajec- 
tory 2677: Greetings. Do you de- 
sire to talk with Base Roquefort? 

To Base Roquefort Orbit 24 Tin- 
ni: Of course. This is interview for 
Bureau of MWU Terran monthly 
bulletin. Very important that you 
have answers to questions. We de- 
sire to know what is being done to 
open planet Tinni. We have interest 
in developing Tinni into monument 
dedicated to colonist tenacity in 
overwhelming odds if Tinni colonists 
are still alive. If colonists are not 
alive then a monument for those 
brave colonists who died serving 
mankind. Clear? 

To BMWU Ship Trajectory 2677 : 
Yes clear. In fifteen hours a volun- 
teer brother of Tinni colonist will 
leave Base Roquefort in latest ship

veloped on Tinni by our bureau. 

To BMWU Ship Trajectory 2677: 
Don’t really know. Perhaps Judician

To BMWU Ship Trajectory 2677: 
Sorry. Underground cities. Very 
primitive. Would the fact that the

dal suspension of atmospheric par- 
ticles in charge field make good 
plavup point for bulletin? 

To Base Roquefort Orbit 24 Tin-

E dmond slapped his whudey 
fiercely, and then calmed him- 
self feeling foolish for taking his 
frustration out on the animal. He 
spoke to it with softer words, talk- 
ing at the same time to himself 
about respect, Cathy, Tinni, Heaven 
and Hell. 

Once again the Minced Moun- 
tain rose behind him. Night was 
approaching cancer-like from the 
west, and the flame-red sunset en- 
couraged his anger at the Exchang- 
ers and at whomever or whatever 
was offering the bounties on scalps. 

Edmond Read searched the sky 
for stars and moons. None, of 
course. No, there did seem to be 
one. A sparkling white fire spot. 
But stars were not supposed to grow 
larger as you watched them. In a 
few seconds this spot was greatly 
larger, and then in a shower of 
light it stopped increasing. It glowed 
for a moment, seemed to wax in 
brilliance, and shattered into pieces, 
which, Edmond noticed in surprise, 
began to grow larger themselves. 
The pieces were falling to earth. 

He sent the whudey galloping 
toward the likely spot where the 
broken “star” would strike the 
world.

IF 




Some hunks were large. Some 
small. Some metal and some meat. 
All the meat was in small chunks. 

“There is something wrong in the 
world, for my mind tells me that 
someone is trying to get in.” Ed- 
mond remembered the prophet’s 
words. Did “get in” mean by foot 
or by whudey from a world on the 
other side of the “sky”. No . not 
by foot or whudey. By platform 
then? Perhaps. 

The “star” must have been a fly- 
ing platform or something. The im- 
mediate conclusion that came to 
Edmond’s mind was that the meat 
pieces were of a flying animal that 
had hit the platform. It would have 
had to have been a big bird to 
shatter a platform, wouldn’t it? The 
pieces of both were so scattered 
around an extensive area that Ed- 
mond could not judge the respective 
sizes. 

He gathered dry bushes, molded 
them into a ball, and retrieved an 
armful of meat pieces. They would 
taste good over a fire, he thought 
as he lit the brush with a match. 
He looked at the miniature torch in 
his fingers as it burst into flame, and 
began to think — where did it come 
from? — but was distracted by 
thoughts of the taste of flying ani- 
mal. 

Edmond enhaled the aroma of the 
roasting meat and suddenly a chill 
made him nauseous. His appetite 
left and he could only think of the 
new words and emotions in him. 
The chill hit him again. 

As he mounted his animal, the 
pieces of meat were burning, some 
turning to ash. Edmond didn’t look 



back. He no longer felt the pieces 
of meat were from a bird. 

J akesu was gesturing wildly and 
shouting, as Edmond entered the 
room behind his back. Jakesu, wild 
and carefree manhunter, couldn’t 
still be alive! But he was there, and 
his beard was graying. Edmond 
smiled to himself and started to 
shout a hello, and hesitated. 

The city rooms were all small, 
and this one was cramped with 
wide-eyed listeners, so at first Ed- 
mond had not seen what his bois- 
terous friend was holding up. One 
of the listeners moved aside and 
Edmond could then see the odd gray 
scalp dangling in Jakesu’s hand. The 
same gray color as had been on the 
flying platform with the Exchanger. 

“They cannot be men, or they 
would not want to kill women.” 
The old man’s thoughts again re- 
turned to Edmond. A flame began 
to roar inside Edmond. 

Pushing and shouting louder than 
anyone, Edmond Reud made his 
way to the scalp. “Where did you 
get that!” 

Jakesu turned. “Edmond! Best 
friend among many friends.” He 
winked. “You mean this fine scalp? 
A strange one, no?” 

“Yes, of course. Where did you 
get it?” Edmond was frantic. 

“Well . .” he pulled Edmond 
over to the side of the crowd, which 
had turned its attention to another 
teller of tales. “I’ll let you in on 
my fortune. There’s more where this 
scalp came from. I heard the clat- 
tering and saw a hundred of them 
near that broken-up mountain.”

Edmond wasn’t sure that Jakesu 
could be trusted, but he had no 
choice really. ‘‘Well, old friend,” 
he said, forcing a smile to match 
Jakesu’s jovial mood, “we should 
show this scalp to the Exchanger.” 
“Just what I was going to do. 
How many pellets do you think?” 
As Edmond threw the scalp to 
the floor, the Exchanger cried out 
and fell backward. Edmond grab- 
bed him by the neck, shaking him, 
and motioned back Jakesu, who was 
stepping forward. “I’m not going to 
hurt him. Wait here,” he told Jakesu 
impatiently, “while I ask him some 
questions.” 

The pale Exchanger’s form was 
limp in Edmond’s hands, and be- 
came limper when Edmond shouted, 
“You recognize this scalp! It be- 
longed to that thing in the platform 
with you, didn’t it? It was flying be- 
side you when you killed that man 
with the platform!” 

The Exchanger began to whine, 
but Edmond went on, finding no 
sympathy for him, “Jakesu says 
there are others with scalps like this. 
They’re not human are they! They 
are not men,” Edmond sneered, “but 
they offer the damned pellets so 
men will kill each other. They 
aren’t men — no respect for the men 
and women we are. You are the 
same as they are, pellet peddler. I 
should vomit the pellets in your 
face.” 

The Exchanger’s eyes lolled and 
breathing slowed. Edmond let him 
fall. 

“Jakesu, I’ve forty pellets. You’ll 
have them if you guide me to the 
other gray scalps, but I don’t plan 



to take any scalps.” Edmond almost 
pleaded, “Believe me. I’m not in- 
terested in them, in scalps or pellets. 
It’s what’s under the scalps.” 
Jakesu looked at Edmond, puz- 
zled, “You’re not interested in pel- 
lets? You’re crazy! You’d die if you 
didn’t have them. You can say you 
don’t need pellets now because 
you’re not in pain, but men change 
once they’re outside the city and 
feeling the cramps and shakes.” 
“No,” Edmond sighed, “I know 
someone who doesn’t need pellets. 
He is alive, he isn’t in pain, and he 
has a memory which we don’t. And 
he is a man!” 

“Forty pellets . .” Jakesu looked 
'thoughtful, even though still con- 
fused. 

“Forty pellets,” Edmond repeated. 
“But as you said, men change once 
outside the city. I’ll give you the 
pellets after we’ve arrived at the 
gray-scalp things.” 

VI 

B oth whudeys pounded the ground 
with bristly hooves, and the 
men grunted rhythmically from the 
jolts. Edmond hurried them on. 

He glanced to the left and saw 
the metal stalk and Mountain near. 
If Edmond had to, he would be 
able to reach Cordaro quickly. 

Jakesu was quiet and fidgety, al- 
ways falling behind. Edmond could 
see the doubt in his colleague’s face. 

“There!” Jakesu finally pointed to 
an abrupt dip in the desert, sur- 
rounded by infrequent large boul- 
ders. 

Why had he nevei come by here 

IF

before? Edmond wondered, and 
then noticed the deep gorges be- 
tween the Minced Mountain and 
^e dip. Only a long exaggerated 
route would allow men to get here 
from the city or the Minced Moun- 
tain because of the gorges. For 
Edmond it had always been direct 
travel between the Mountain and 
the city, back and forth, as both 
the Mountain and the need for 
pellets had called him in turn. 

Both men dismounted and crept 
behind one of the rock giants that 
spotted the area. 

The mind-prickling and tingling 
was starting again. Edmond cursed. 

Up close, the dip was not really 
a dip, but rather an immense nat- 
ural hole in the desert. Seven meter 
high cliffs were the walls of the 
hole. A cave opening — twice the 



size of the one where Edmond had 
found Cordaro — blackened the far 
end of the hole. 

Edmond squinted. Gray figures 
scurried here and there; and the 
flying platform rested near the cave 
entrance. 

“Jakesu, how did you get down 
there?” It was hard for Edmond to 
whisper when he wanted to shout. 

Jakesu stared at him in puzzle- 
ment again, and shook his head 
slowly. He reluctantly pointed to a 
natural shelf on the cliff near the 
cave opening. “I slipped down to 
that, and roped the gray-scalp one 
when he was getting off that round 
metal contraption.” Jakesu hesitat- 
ed, but then went on. “Rivul skin 
rope is strong. I hauled him up to 
the ledge, and killed him. He’s prob- 
ably still there. Rotting.” 



WE HUNTERS OF MEN 



55 




It took fifteen minutes to move 
from boulder to boulder and to the 
cliff edge above the shelf without 
being seen. 

Edmond turned to the graying 
beard behind him. “Here are the 
forty pellets.” He shoved them into 
Jakesu's hand. “I’m going down 
there now. If you want, you can 
join me " Edmond fitted a reed into 
the cro.ssbovv. and shifted it to his 
right hand. 

J akesu said nothing at firsts but 
then began moving toward him. 
“You must be crazy.” Jakesu seem- 
ed determined. “All your talk, crazy 
talk. Edmond, 1 can’t chance you 
messing up this set-up; it’s a for- 
tune in pellets. Don’t go down there, 
iriease.’^ Jakesu had lost his humor. 

Edmond glared at him, silently 
and Jakesu advanced, facial features 
contorting as he grabbed at Ed- 
mond’s neck. 

Edmond Reud dropped the cross- 
bow, grasped one of Jakesu’s el- 
bows and sleeve, rolled back, sank 
a foot into Jakesu’s stomach, and 
pitched a bewildered Jakesu over the 
ledge. 

The scalper’s spine cracked loud- 
ly as Jakesu struck the ledge and 
continued falling. 

The gray non-humans dashed 
about clumsily, as Edmond hid. 

Without being noticed he slipped 
down to the ledge, and shot five 
of the creatures with reeds. A high 
shrilling, seeming to come from 
their own mouths, trailed after the 
fleeing forms. Edmond found an 
opportunity to drop down the last 
four meters of cliff wall. 



Legs aching from impact, he re- 
trieved the reeds, wiped off the 
almost “human” blood and entered 
the cave at a run. 

About twenty of them stood there, 
motionless. Edmond killed two, but, 
seeing that they were not about to 
attack, stopped and cautiously walk- 
ed through them. 

Something hit him from behind, 
but he was ready and he turned, 
swinging a fist. A cranium caved in 
under his hand to Edmond’s sur- 
prise and the lifeless body of the 
brave gray-scalp thing fell back into 
the group. It had been so soft. So 
weak. Edmond shuddered . and 
surprised himself by turning and 
taking out his insecurity on the 
creatures that huddled before him. 

The blood from the twenty non- 
humans was so thick on the reeds 
he didn’t even bother to clean it 
off. 

The animals at his feet, he con- 
cluded, were neither especially in- 
telligent nor physically strong. They 
had seemed to be merely doing the 
work and not supervising it when 
Edmond had first seen them. He 
couldn’t believe that they were the 
bounty offerers. He knew, as he 
seemed to know so many other 
things lately — perhaps through a 
life he couldn’t remember — that 
these creatures were but the slaves 
or servants of the real bounty of- 
ferers. What Edmond wanted was 
not the “slave”, but rather the 
“slave-owner”, and if the slaves 
were at work, the slave-owner would 
be at rest. In the cave . 

The Minced Mountain still called, 
but he remembered an obligation to 



56 



IF 




Tinni. He wanted to find those who 
were for ‘‘the death of Tinni and 
all men.” His goal had changed, he 
realized; or had it? 

Someone coughed. Edmond whirl- 
ed in the semi-darkness and watched 
a second Exchanger he had seen 
in the city, amble by unaware. 

“Traitor.” Edmond whispered 
hoarsely. The caves echoed slightly. 

The Exchanger’s knees bent, as 
he almost collapsed against the cave 
wall. Quickly Edmond slipped a 
reed from the bundle and pressed 
it hard against the man’s throat. “I 
won’t kill you now,” Edmond an- 
nounced, “if you tell me enough, 
and ‘enough’ is everything you 
know.” 

The man squirmed under the 
reed; Edmond let up a little. 

“I’ve taken the pellets,” Edmond 
spoke again. “So I don’t have much 
of a memory, but I know enough 
to know when you’re lying.” He 
pressed down on the reed. 

A gasp, and then slowly: “I could 
not help it.” The Exchanger 
seemed to fall apart, eyes watering. 
“Do you know what a Judician is?” 
Edmond felt the word “Judician” 
and the gray things he had just 
killed associate themselves. He nod- 
ded. 

“The Judicians put the field 
around Tinni. Then the Judician 
Centurion — the commander of the 
weak ones — found me wrecking 
their weapons. I managed to get to 
all the weapons except one, but 
they couldn’t use it. They’re too 
weak and disorganized to get it on 
the sand foil and move it.” 



As each new word was spoken, 
it became old and fell into place 
in Edmond’s mind. Pieces of mem- 
ory filled his head with a light and 
a confusion. 

The Exchanger mumbled on, pa- 
thetically, even to Edmond. “They 
kept me a prisoner in the cave. I 
had to eat what they gave me — 
I didn’t know it was a narcotic, that 
it would give me hallucinations. 
They ate it, too, so I didn’t have 
any idea I would get addicted. 
Please believe me!” 

“And the pellets you give men 
are narcotics, too?” Edmond had a 
grim line for a mouth. 

The Exchanger nodded slowly. 
“But the pellets they made me hand 
out to men make human beings lose 
memory association. The Judicians 
had studied the effects of narcotics 
on men a long time before. They 
knew men would kill each other to 
get the pellets, if they put a pellet 
price on a human scalp, and mad : 
men forget most of their lives. The 
Judicians are trying to kill all men 
on Tinni. They have high prices on 
women’s scalps so we won’t repro- 
duce — so we’ll die off. I didn’t 
know what the Judicians were doing 
until too late. I couldn’t do any- 
thing about it. The Centurion said 
I wouldn’t get any more of their 
food if I didn’t start the pellets 
around, exchange them for scalps 
after men were addicted and turn 
the scalps I got into him. I haven’t 
killed anybody like everybody else 
has.” The Exchanger was panick- 
ing. “Even you’ve killed a lot of 
men. I couldn’t help it. Even if I 
had refused the Centurion and died. 



WE HUNTERS OF MEN 



57 




the Judicians would have found 
someone else to take my place as 
an Exchanger. You want to live, too. 
I didn’t want to die.” The Exchang- 
er’s voice was at a ridiculously high 
pitch when he finally stopped. 

Edmond looked at him, feeling 
empty of most emotion. ‘‘You 
wouldn’t have died . but you 
didn’t know that . Edmond 
realized he was half talking to him- 
self, but didn’t care. “I should kill 
you and the other Exchanger. I 
should throw your scalps at the 
feet of the Centurion, but I am too 
sick of you to touch you.” 

The Exchanger was in a pile on 
the cave floor, and Edmond stood 
over him. “What is the metal stalk 
on the shattered mountain?” 

“It’s the conductor for the charge 
field generators inside the moun- 
tain. It holds up the field.” 

“Why,” Edmond asked, “didn’t 
you go to it and try to wreck or 
turn off the generators?” He didn’t 
listen for an answer. The Exchang- 
er would say something about the 
Centurion having the food he need- 
ed and that he would have died if 
he hadn’t gotten the food. 

Edmond began to shutter. He 
needed pellets. There were some on 
Jakesu’s body, but he loathed to 
touch it. He swore at the pellets 
along with • the continuous mind- 
prickling that added to the torture 
of frustration and advancing pain. 
Now was not the time to be dis- 
abled by spasms and cramps . 

He had to find the Centurion. 

A rhythmic sliding was coming 
down the passageway of the 



cave. Edmond set the reed deli- 
cately in his weapon and waited. 

The Judician Centurion rumbled 
incoherently when It saw him. Iti 
massive stomach, which was being 
pushed along on a leathery callous, 
bounced to a stop. 

“Greetings!” cried the alien, and 
Edmond laughed with a new hatred. 
The thing was completely non- 
human. 

Edmond retorted, ‘ “Is death 
worth greeting?” 

He followed the thought of the 
Centurion’s brain when the Judi- 
cian said, “I will give you anything 
you want. You will sit alone above 
all men in the world. I am strange 
and powerful, so I can give you 
all that you want — even those lit- 
tle round things you need so bad- 
ly. I — ” 

A gurgling interrupted. Edmond 
shot the reed at an angle through 
the soft belly, and reloaded the 
crossbow. There was a thump as 
he sank another shaft into it be- 
yond sight. 

Without warning, Edmond was 
enveloped from behind. He only 
had time to scream once and see 
the face of a second Centurion 
looking down at him with long 
thin lips. 

The sides of the cave room drip- 
ped minerals, and were encrusted 
with a rainbow of colors. 

A syrup seemed to be flowing 
through Edmond’s stomach. He 
glanced sideways at the second Cen- 
turian, which was holding some long 
pellet in its multi-segmented fin- 
gers and was attempting a human 
smile. 



IF 




Edmond recognized the pellet as 
one like the Exchanger in the city 
had swallowed and the kind of pel- 
kt the other Exchanger had just 
talked about as being a hallucina- 
tion inducer. 

Edmond was prepared when the 
syrupy feeling swelled and the hal- 
lucinations began . 

When the hallucinations passed, 
Edmond didn’t want to think about 
them. They had involved death of 
Tinni and all men, over and over 
again. 

He realized how stupid he had 
been to assume the existence of only 
one Centurion just because the Ex- 
changer had mentioned only one. 

No worse error could have been 
made. And within only a few hours 
of success. All it would have tak- 
en to open the skies and save what 
was left of Tinni was a quick ride 
in the sand foil — it would have 
been easy enough to control — and 
then a search of Cordaro’s cave for 
the passageway to the generators. 
Only a few hours and the sky would 
have fallen for good. 

Edmond kicked himself mental- 
ly. He was too excited to become 
depressed, so crying was not among 
his plans. Plans? He had no plans! 



The Centurion came forward 
with another pellet. It held a 
screaming Edmond Reud down with 
its heavy stomach, poked him in the 
groin to make him open his mouth 
wider, and forced the “food” down 
his throat. 

Edmond sprang away, and stuck 
his own fingers down his throat, 
vomiting the pellets up. As tears 
rolled down his cheeks, he cried 
out in victory. If he could help it, 
he would not be addicted to an- 
other kind of pellet. For God’s 
sake, not another habit! 

H is actions had stumped the 
Centurion. It looked so con- 
fused — even more confused by Ed- 
mond’s actions than Edmond had 
ever been by Judician behavior — 
that Edmond almost laughed. If the 
alien could use pellets and hal- 
lucinations against him, he could 
do the same back. 

The Centurion sat in front of the 
doorway and partially closed its 
eyes. Edmond pretended to sleep, 
and almost fell asleep before the 
alien finally let its own lids com- 
pletely shut. 

With a leap from the floor Ed- 
mond reached the Judician, grabbed

the pellets from its fingers and 
jammed them down its throat al- 
most to his stomach. 

The alien burped terribly, cough- 
ed and tried another smile: “Very 
fine food.” 

Edmond could have screamed 
and wept. He feared for his sani- 
ty: how absurd could human logic 
be. If the pellets were alien food, 
then they wouldn’t be a narcotic 
for the aliens, too. He wouldn’t 
accomplish anything with warped 
logic, he told himself. 

The Centurion still sat blocking 
the cave-room doorway. Was it 
waiting for something or some- 
body? 

Edmond decided to make a play 
on its waiting, if that’s what the 
Centurion was doing. 

He shuffled over to a bulge in 
the rock floor, and braced his 
foot against it, the squatting alien 
out of eyesight of the movement. 

The Centurion stared at him un- 
blinkingly. Edmond tried to act 
nonchalant, but then caught him- 
self again. What was nonchalant to 
a human wouldn’t be nonchalant 
to an alien. Edmond allowed him- 
self to act nervous. It wasn’t hard. 

“Who’s that!” Edmond shouted 
as loud as he could, and pointed 
abruptly through the doorway down 
the corridor’s shadows. The alien 
strained its neck to see, unbalanc- 
ing itself by resting on a flimsy 
arm. 

Edmond pushed off from the 
bulge in the floor and toppled the 
Centurion, mashing its face into 
the wall. With a kind of joy he 
trampled its face and neck. 



After an exploration of metal 
sticks and buttons on the sand foil, 
and a dash across the gorges and 
desert, Edmond Reud found Cor- 
daro waiting for him at the cave. 
A quick greeting, and Edmond left 
the puzzled man as he ran into the 
intestines of the mountain. 

Edmond was awed when there 
was no great rumbling or bang as 
he pulled on the generator switch 
and cut off the charge field around 
his planet. 

VII 

T he beardless young man with 
the straw-colored hair and neat 
pale-blue uniform announced him- 
self as Lieutenant Commander 
Charles Finglebower of Base Roque- 
fort, which was presently orbiting 
Tinni, and that he had come to 
help Tinni recuperate from its or- 
deal. Edmond and Cordaro greet- 
ed him by the Minced Mountain. 

Edmond Reud and the Lieuten- 
ant Commander found four hours 
and forty-seven minutes the mini- 
mum length of time to discuss the 
status of things in general on Tin- 
ni and in the Universe. At the end 
of that time, Edmond’s memory 
had returned to him, in all its 
beauty. Even the ugly events had 
a special beauty of presence. His 
head was bursting with answers 
to the questions he had carried with 
him so long. Questions about the 
well, which the Colonization Super- 
visors had dug fifty years before 
. the water bags the Supervisors 
had stocked the city with . the 
tops of the mountains which had

IF 




been dark because the force field 
had obscured them . 

The Lieutenant Commander men- 
tioned the unsuccessful attempt of 
volunteer Sam Cordaro to enter 
the charge field during the night. 
Edmond remembered with a fami- 
liar chill the night when it had 
seemed a “platform” had hit a 
“bird” ... he remembered how he 
had almost eaten the savory meat 
scattered around. Edmond grew 
sick for a moment and realized he 
would always have a secret from 
his friend Richard Cordaro. Ed- 
mond finally managed a smile. 

“Don’t worry,” said Lieutenant 
Commander Finglebower. “We have 
known about the narcotic effect 
of the Judician food upon humans 
for just as long as the Judicians. 
Injections can be given to eradi- 
cate the addictions of the colonists. 
No trouble at all.” 

Edmond felt a needle slip into 
his arm, and a woman — a wom- 
an! — in pale blue smiled at him. 

“I would like to do some of the 
injections myself,” Edmond found 
himself saying to a surprised Lieu- 
tenant Commander Finglebower. 
“I’ll find what men and women 
are left in the cities and give ^em 
the medicine. You could give me 
the needles and a few light shock- 
ers to calm the scalp hunters, and 
a little instruction for the injec- 
tions ...” 

Finglebower shrugged his shoul- 
ders and nodded, “Fine. The nurse 
will show you the proper proce- 
dure soon. But now I want you to 
meet a person who’ll be very im- 
portant to Tinni very soon. He’s 



a representative of the Bureau of 
the Million Wonders of the Uni- 
verse, and he wants to talk to you 
and Richard very much. He’ll be 
out of the ship in a minute.” 
Something uneasy stirred in Ed- 
mond’s mind at the memory of thd 
Bureau of MWU. The uneasiness 
grew. He remembered what the 
Bureau had done to other planets 
and men.

▼ ▼ soon as possible to make 
Tinni a monument,” announced the 
Bureau representative enthusiastical- 
ly. “I’ll give you the details tomor- 
row when I bring the big BMWU 
ship down. Each of the remaining 
colonists will be given a job as 
guide or lecturer. Both men and 
women. Many female tourists — a 
lot of Suffrage Succeeders — will 
flock here; and perhaps an artifi- 
cial lake can be put In to make 
Tinni a real riviera. Historical, ad- 
venturous, wonderful. All adjec- 
tives describing Tinni. Can’t you 
see the picture of it now?” 

“As a commercialized touristic 
pot,” Edmond retorted. 

“Well, there is no dishonor in 
that, you know. A hundred plan- 
ets are that way: they show men 
and women how great Mankind has 
been and always will be. For in- 
stance, Sasham’s World ...” 
Edmond didn’t hear any more. 
He began to think about things that 
were just now returning to him .

women making another Terra, or 
at least trying awfully hard. Laugh- 
ter — perhaps the greatest memory. 
Pride. Respect for each other, for 
Tinni. 

The Respect towered in his mind. 

He remembered sunsets and furry 
whudeys silhouetted on the deserts. 
Whudeys with soft humps and flat- 
tened noses nuzzling the warm sand. 

But as he thought of the BMWU, 
the sunsets became marred by 
shapes of a thousand starships. 
Some fat, some thin, some fast, 
some sluggish, some looking preg- 
nant, almost in caricature of the 
millions of people the ships were 
carrying in their bowels. The 
BMWU turned the whudeys into 
animals, laughed at, teased, jabbed, 
penned up until Edmond’s mind 
screamed. 

F rom a rather omnipotent view- 
ing place high on Minced Moun- 
tain, Edmond Reud and Richard 
Cordaro watched the lone Base 
Roquefort ship grumble, belch and 
rise. 

Another Tinni sunset was begin- 
ning, and there was enough sun- 
light for Edmond to extend an im- 
aginary hand over the boxes that 



the ship had left, with plans of 
returning the next day with sur- 
veyors and with the BMWU ship. 
The boxes contained shockers, 
canned food, water to be added to 
the Minced Mountain stores, nee- 
dles and serum, and gleaming metal 
equipment to aid Tinni’s renaissance. 
Edmond nodded the ship a thank 
you. 

He turned with a sigh to Cor- 
daro. “There is something I remem- 
ber now. It was etched on something 
long ago on Terra, almost like your 
words on the shelves. It was a 
question, and I wish now that I 
had asked it of the Bureau man: 
‘Is there no respect of place, per- 
sons, nor time in you?’ There didn’t 
seem to be any in the Bureau man, 
or in the rest of them either.” 

Cordaro looked at him. “They 
should neither touch nor have Tin- 
ni, should they?” 

Edmond smiled. 

Leaning on Edmond’s shoulder, 
Cordaro hobbled beside him, as 
they began a walk toward the quiet 
generator switch. Perhaps in a 
hundred generations, or whenever^ 
someone on Tinni decided to open 
the field again. Mankind might have 
changed. Edmond hoped so. END

H/s real business was insurance. 
But the goings-on in the crater 
had to be everybody's business! 



I 

J ohnathon Andrews was work- 
ing. Two hundred credit 
marks a day plus expenses testified 
that Marine Surety Inc. sanctioned 
his activities and remembered him, 
at least on payday. Glancing at his 
watch, he paid the waiter and walk- 
ed leisurely across the flagstone 



terrace behind the hotel toward 
Waikiki Beach. 

The waiter stood looking after 
him thoughtfully for a moment, 
then hurried to a small table just 
behind the door of the inside bar. 

‘^Can I bring you anything else, 
sir?” He smiled professionally and 
dried the watermark under an empty 
glass.

The large man at the table stared 
at him impassively but didn’t answer. 

The waiter produced a carved 
swizzle stick and laid it in the 
center of the table. 

“The beach is beautiful this time 
of evening,” the waiter said, and 
bustled away into the kitchen. 

The large man stood up, looked 
around the room and brushed 
against a solitary customer at the 
end of the bar as he headed out 
the door. The man at the bar paid 
no attention, but very shortly he, 
too, got up and walked out toward 
the beach. 

Through a slit in the shutter of 
a dressing cabana Johnny Andrews 
watched the two come single file 
across the terrace. They looked up 
and down the nearly deserted beach 
and then settled into solitary chairs 
on opposite sides of the terrace. 

This hunch is paying off, Johnny 
thought as he changed into a bath- 
ing suit. Hunches are poor substi- 
tutes for facts, but there were no 
facts. At least there were none to 
justify the expense account Marine 
Surety’s fair-haired investigator had 
run up the last four days. 

Making a down payment on 
Diamond Head was hardly the con- 
ventional route of inquiry into a 
series of hi-jackings — but these hi- 
jackings were- hardly conventional. 

F irst, the sheer size of the take 
was like heisting the west 
wing of Fort Knox. Second, these 
robberies were happening entirely 
outside the atmosphere. Third, no 
one had any better ideas. 

Those two spectators on the 



terrace were the first indication that 
someone might be interested in him 
besides the comptroller back in the 
home office. Maybe he could follow 
them home. In any event it was 
now six forty five and the sight he 
came to see was due very soon. 

He left his clothes in the cabana 
and stepped out into the soft 
Hawaiian twilight. Picking a power- 
board from the stack beside the 
cabana, he trotted down to the 
water. 

Johnny was old fashioned and 
basically disapproved of the cigar- 
sized power units stuffed into most 
surf boards nowadays. Any over- 
weight office manager could glide 
effortlessly out to where the really 
large rollers broke and usually found 
them more than he could cope with. 
Right now, though, a powerboard 
was exactly what he needed. 

The fading sunset had switched 
on a few dim stars, but most of 
the sky was still glowing with left- 
over daylight. The tide was nearly 
in, but the sea was so quiet that 
the first thousand yards were only 
waist deep. He flopped down onto 
the board and opened the finger 
throttle half way, heading straight 
out to sea away from the lights. 

About fifteen hundred yards out 
there was a shallow depression in 
the bottom where the tall breakers 
coming from over the night horizon 
rounded off for a moment before 
their last long crashing run into the 
hotel beaches. He stopped the board 
in this quiet area and twisted over 
onto his back to watch the northern 
sky. He checked his watch; two 
minutes still to go.

IF 




T wo shipments in a row of high- 
grade irillium had vanished 
without a trace. Two more like that 
and his net assignment would be 
locating a cheap wholesale source 
of bulk red ink — and with no ex- 
pense account. 

Marine Surety had become the 
giant of commercial cargo insurance 
by backing long shots, but a single 
shipload of irillium would top the 
national budget of half the nations 
on the planet. Somewhere out be- 
yond the fading twilight three more 
cargoes were inbound. 

The first one was due tonight. 
His watch showed the time had 
run down and he concentrated on 
the north end of the vanishing sun- 
set. Moving slowly, two dim pin- 
pK>ints of light detached themselves 
from the afterglow and crawled 
steadily up the sky growing brighter 
as they approached the dark zenith. 

Guessing right was a profession 
with Johnny Andrews and this trip 
looked like a better guess all the 
time. It had to be here. Out be- 
yond the parking orbit zone a dif- 
ference of a minute or so in de- 
parture time would throw the track 
of an interplanetary transverse tra- 
jectory a million miles either way, 
but they all had to come down the 
" Pie chute to get home. This was 
the chute — the only place a 
planned intercept really could take 
place. 

The two points of light drew 
closer together as they reached the 
top of the sky. Retrofire position 
to put the cargo ship into the North 
African docks would be about half 
way down the eastern sky from 



Hawaii, but the two points had 
merged long before that. 

That second ship had made an 
incredibly accurate rendezvous. 

At least he had a starting place 
now. First, get ashore and confirm 
with the home office that the com- 
pany was about one national budget 
closer to bankruptcy; then find out 
where those two oversized oeach- 
boys went when they weren’t loung- 
ing around expensive terraces look- 
ing ominous. 

H e paddled the board around to 
point in the general direction 
of downtown Honolulu and used the 
power switch to move quietly par- 
allel with the swells about a hundred 
yards to one side of the terrace. 
Then, staying flat on the board to 
keep his silhouette low, he ope ned 
the throttle and slid into the 
trough behind the biggest wave he 
could find. 

The board kicked forward leaving 
a froth of white water which he 
hoped wouldn’t be too noticeable so 
far out. Very shortly the sea bottom 
began to shallow and shove the big 
swell up into a long curling crest 
of surf that thundered nearly half 
a mile straight in to the beach. 

Johnny hung on with full power, 
hidden right behind it. With a little 
kick he hoped the gallery on the 
terrace would still be gazing out to 
sea waiting for him to appear 
sliding grandly down the front of a 
wave where surf boards belong. 

He slid up a backwash of froth 
onto a stretch of beach where the 
dark palms grew almost down to 
the high tide. Just behind the first 



THE CRATER

row of trees the underbrush was 
expensively natural. Except for an 
indignant couple who had bargained 
for a little more privacy in the 
shadow of a tree, he thought he 
was unobserved. 

He left the powerboard and 
slipped into the tangled vegetation. 

Nowhere in the world but Ha- 
waii could a man parade through 
the bushes without clothes in solid 
comfort. Things that stung, bit or 
scratched had never been tolerated, 
even during the brief interlude when 
the early missionaries had managed 
to get clothes on the natives. 

Staying about ten feet inside the 
dark undergrowth he felt his way 
carefully back toward the terrace. 
Now that he was free of his 
watchers the next step posed a 
problem in etiquette. He needed to 
contact McComb back in the home 
office in Kansas City to confirm the 
hi-jacking he thought he’d just 
seen — and those two interested 
parties on the terrace needed some 
serious attention. Knowing who 
they worked for could save weeks 
of blind stumbling. But a dripping 
swimsuit is a bit conspicuous after 
dark, even in Honolulu, 

II 

T hey . were still tliefe, sitting 
stolidly at each corner of the 
terrace. The heavy one had ordered 
a drink. Johnny looked him over 
for future reference. He weighed 
about 230 and perhaps 40 pounds 
of it was excess. Even without the 
fat he’d be barrel-shaped, with a 
neck that was a visual protest 



against the custom of wearing col- 
lars. Straight, light brown hair and 
suit to match — Johnny couldn’t get 
an eye color from this distance, but 
the layer of flesh on high cheek 
bones pushed them nearly out of 
sight anyway. 

The other man was thin, brunette 
and faced away from him. His left 
ear lobe was missing. 

Johnny moved back through the 
tangle of vines to the edge of the 
side lawn of the hotel where bogan- 
villia had been planted to make 
certain the guests knew they were 
in Hawaii. Here, out of sight of the 
terrace, he marched stiffly across 
the lawn to the side entrance like 
any other newly arrived malahini 
determined to go native comfort- 
ably. 

Ten minutes later with dry 
clothes on, the situation appeared 
much less complex. It’s remarkable 
how a pair of trousers increases a 
man’s self-confidence, he reflected 
on the way back down the elevator. 
Simply get a video tape of these two 
gentlemen and transmit it to the 
home office. From then on help 
could be as close as the nearest 
police station in case he lost them. 

He stopped at the terrace bar for 
some sort of unpronounceable con- 
coction served in a bulky coconut 
shell. Then he sauntered out onto 
the terrace holding a pocket-sized 
tape-camera behind the drink. This 
was too easy. Just sit down, lean 
back, take a healthy sip pointed 
toward each one and they’d be re- 
corded for posterity. 

The first sip was the longest. He 
had cautiously avoided looking

IF 




around before he sat down and aim- 
ing for the sknny one he got a long 
picture of an empty chair. He 
glanced quickly at the other corner. 

T he big man was still there. He 
knew the eye color now. So 
light gray they were almost white, 
they stared impassively at his pecu- 
liar method of holding a coconut 
shell. 

Johnny had two more gulps than 
he intended before he could get 
the glass down. 

Now what? he thought. If he 
didn’t see the camera, it’s his turn 
next. If he did see it, there’s nothing 
to lose, so it’s still his turn next 
He looked blandly around the 
terrace and then aimed a healthy 
pull on the coconut shell at White 
Eyes. 

By now the terrace had taken 
on a misty, unreal appearance that 
probably had something to do with 
his hurried draughts from that coco- 
nut. He’d watched the bartender 
insert two kinds of rum, some vod- 
ka, raw coconut milk and crushed 
pineapple and hadn’t seriously in- 
tended to drink the thing. 

He heaved himself to his re!u'\.nt 
feet and ambled across the terrace. 
There was a not-so-cleverly dis- 
guised phone booth near the beach 
cabanas In the shape of a miniature 
polynesean temple, from which he 
could still see the terrace while he 
called McComb. 

Moving around made him feel 
a little better as he left the lighted 
terrace to enter the phone-temple 
from the beach side. It opened on 
the water so the customers got the 



full benefit of the Waikiki surf 
background roar when they called 
back home. 

He inserted the tape magazine 
from his camera into the video- 
phone recepticle and turned off the 
light in the booth in order to see 
the terrace better. White Eyes had 
turned around and was looking 
down across the darkened beach. 

“I wonder where his skinny part- 
ner went?” he said to himself as he 
started dialing. 

He found out between the fourth 
and fifth digits. There was a glimpse 
of rapid motion just behind him and 
to one side. He whirled directly into 
a small but thoroughly profes- 
sional leather sap laid just above his 
left ear. The last thing he remem- 
bered was wondering inanely how 
this guy lost his left ear lobe when 
he was obviously left-handed. 

T he bartender looked up and 
shook his head in rueful profes- 
sional pride as he watched his latest 
Muana Loa Special customer being 
helped by two friends as he stum- 
bled across the terrace toward the 
side lawn of the hotel. He signaled 
a busboy to go out and retrieve the 
coconut shell. 

Johnny had a hard head, but was 
realistic enough to sit quietly and let 
it throb when things came back into 
focus. He was wedged into a tube- 
car seat designed for two between 
White Eyes and Lefty. As his vision 
cleared slowly, he felt the gentle 
jostle of the capsule-like car as it 
sped along an airless steel tube a 
thousand feet below the surface of 
the Pacific.

IF 




Judging from the advertisements 
around the walls this was one of 
the inter-island locals that fed com- 
muters and money into Oahu from 
ah the surrounding islands. 

Wherever they were headed he 
didn’t have much time because 
these vacuum cars shot all the way 
to the last island in the chain in 
less than twenty minutes. 

He began slowly raising a hand 
to feel his head, but the big man 
beside him fastened a paw on his 
arm that felt like a steel claw. 
Lefty also shifted his weight warn- 
ingly and he subsided to look 
around the car. 

They were at the rear. It was 
nearly empty. The commuter rush 
was over and people in town for 
the evening were still there. Well, 
he’d wanted to know where they 
lived. 

“Are you gentlemen always so 
attentive to lonely tourists?” he 
ventured. 

“We’ll talk later, Mr. Andrews,” 
White Eyes rumbled. His voice had 
a gurgling quality that left the im- 
pression that he didn’t use it very 
often. His big hand tightened again 
on Johnny’s arm in a way that left 
the impression that he used it a lot. 

The cdr began slowing and two 
or three of the passengers stood up 
and started back toward the exit at 
the rear. Johnny and his escort sat 
quietly until the car stopped, but 
when the last passenger was out he 
was hurried to his feet and out 
onto the platform just before the 
door hissed shut. The last of the 
passengers was disappearing up an 
escalator marked WAILUKU as die 



three of them crossed the deserted 
platform to follow. 

T he street at the top was not 
much better. Wailuku may be 
the “capital” of the island of Maui, 
but things get pretty quiet in a 
farm community when the sun goes 
down. No traffic was moving. They 
started down the street toward the 
only sign of life, a forlorn estab- 
lishment with a single car parked 
in front. The lighted sign dangling 
precariously across the sidewalk 
read, “Fenner’s Grill”. 

“Want me to drive?” Lefty said 
as they approached the car. 

“It talks!” exclaimed Johnny, and 
then winced from the increased 
pressure on his left arm from that 
vice-like hand. His fingers were 
beginning to numb. 

“I’ll do it,” White Eyes said. “Get 
in the back and lay him out again 
if he moves a muscle.” 

They were in front of the little 
restaurant now and Lefty opened 
the back door of the car. Lettering 
from the last half of a gold sign on 
the side of the car could be seen on 
the front door as White Eyes re- 
laxed his grip to reach for the car 
door. Johnny’s arm sagged helpless- 
ly, but the other one was still 
intact. 

It’s now or nothing, he thought, 
and drove his good right arm into 
Lefty’s midsection about two inches 
past the waist. He felt White Eyes 
clutch at his coat and miss as he 
whirled away and dove for the door 
to “Fenner’s Grill”. 

Leaning against the door from the 
inside he tried to remember whether

ftere was a special phrase rtiedieval 
fugitives were supposed to use to 
claim sanctuary in a cathedral. A 
•mall round Chinese bartender sat 
behind a tiny bar on one side of 
the room still holding the paper he’d 
been reading. 

‘‘How about a beer,” Johnny said 
finally, nothing else coming to mind. 

Outside, he heard the car start 
and looked back as he walked over 
to the bar stool. It was a station 
wagon, he could see now, with a 
symbol consisting of two concentric 
circles painted on the side. White 
Eyes was driving with Lefty 
slumped down in the back seat. 
As they pulled away gold letters 
reading “Crater Ranch” flashed 
briefly over the symbol in the light 
of Fenner’s sign. 

Ill 

4 C A re you from the Crater?” 
asked the bartender hand- 
ing him a glass. His stiff hair was 
crew cut to a gray stubble and a 
heavy un-Chinese beard threatened 
to westernize his clean shaven plump 
cheeks. 

“No, I’m here on a vacation,” 
Johnny sighed as he sat down and 
began rubbing some circulation back 
into his left arm. “What’s the 
Crater?” • 

“In that case you’ve found the 
best Mexican food in the islands. 
The second booth is empty,” the 
bartender beamed. All of the tables 
were inclosed in booths with walls 
clear to the ceiling Chinese style 
with curtains across the front. 

“Thanks — just the beer, ’ Johnny 



said. All the booths were probably 
empty; not just the second one. The 
place was quiet as a desert. “What’s 
the Crater?” 

“We don’t often get tourists. Ihey 
hang around Honolulu and Oahu 
and never see the real Hawaii,” 
the little bartender pressed a button 
behind the counter and an even 
rounder, almond-eyed girl came 
scuttling from a back room with a 
clean table cloth and utensils. 

“I’m not hungry nowl” Johnny 
protested still rubbing nis arm. 
“What’s the Crater?” 

“Oh, just a cattle ranch. Did you 
know the mountain valley you can 
see right out that window is where 
it rains two hundred inches a year? 
There’s not any decent Mexican 
food in Honolulu, you know.” 
“Where is it?” 

“Right in the second booth. Car- 
lotta’s bringing your Ming tea. It’s 
our specialty with chalupas and . .” 
“The cattle ranch. Where’s the 
cattle ranch? I really couldn’t eat 
a thing.” 

“Carlotta, just bring some tosta- 
dos to the bar, then,” the bartender 
sighed and opened another beer — 
apparently for himself. “Haleak.ala.” 
“Cheers. Where’s the ranch?” 
“That’s where it is — Ha-ie-a-ka- 
la. That’s the name of the moun- 
tain. Most of my customers are 
local — a few commuters and lately 
that crowd from the Crater. Straight 
across out the front door you can 
see part of Molokai Island. There’s 
one place there you can see nearly 
fifty waterfalls at the same time 
coming down the side of a three 
thousand foot cliff.”

IF 




“Then the Crater’s new,” Johnny 
tried again. 

44/^h no, that’s where the whole 
island of Maui came from. 
Haleakala’s a volcano.” 

“I mean the ranch.” 

“Well, the Haleakala crater’s been 
used to graze cattle over a hundred 
years. It’s the biggest volcanic 
crater in the world about twenty 
miles across. It’s extinct. You can 
see it right out the kitchen window. 
Most tourists get sunburned at 
Waikiki and take a ride over the 
Pali and think they’ve seen the 
islands. You can’t get up there now, 
though.” 

“To the crater, you mean.” 

“That’s right. Some big outfit 
leased it last summer and put up a 
gate house on the only road up the 
mountain. It’s hard to see how 
they’re going to make any money, 
though. They’ve hauled almost as 
many people up there as they have 
cattle.” 

Johnny almost congratulated him. 
It wasn’t any harder than extract- 
ing a tooth, he thought. Aloud he 
asked, “Is there a phone booth 
around?” 

“Yes sir. The first booth is a 
phone booth. The second one is set 
up for your dinner whenever you’re 
ready. Try a tostado while I get you 
another beer.” 

“Thanks,” Johnny said, too spent 
to argue. He took his first beer, 
still full, and went over to the first 
booth. Behind the curtains was the 
glass door of an oversize videophone 
set-up complete with a chair and 
small table. He dialed McComb, 



wincing instinctively between the 
fourth and fifth digits. 

There was a tapping at the glass 
as McComb’s face appeared on the 
screen and looked past his shoulder 
with skeptical disapproval. The little 
Chinese was still talking on the 
other side of the soundproof glass 
brandishing the plate of tostados. 

“Just a minute, Mac,” Johnny said 
and opened the door. 

“You forgot your tostados,” the 
bartender said. “TeU your friend on 
Maui it’s Fenner’s.” 

“Thank you, he ... ” but the door 
was closed and the curtains pulled 
shut. 

44Tt’s nice to see a man en- 
X joying his last fling,” Mc- 
Comb said drily. 

“You wouldn’t believe it anyway.” 
“We just lost another ship.” 

“I know — I watched.” 

“From there?” 

“Mac, it has to be from here. 
There’s no other place they could 
make an intercept. Could you see 
anything on the screen?” 

“Maybe. There were some scat- 
tered static returns just behind the 
ship right after it came into range 
that could have been a merging 
ship. Anyway it went right by with- 
out firing the retro rockets just like 
the others.” 

“Where is it now?” 

“Vanished. Once they’re out of 
orbit they’re gone unless they an- 
swer a radio call.” McComb looked 
defeated. 

“That’s exactly why I’m sure 
someone’s controlling an intercept 
from here. This is the only place

where a returning ship has to pass 
through part of a predictable earth 
orbit in order to hit the dock area. 
You can’t get into the garage with- 
out using the driveway. This is the 
driveway.” 

‘‘Well, did you call me to recom- 
mend the tostados?” 

“They’re made of poi. We need 
a check on a skinny black-haired 
guy about 35 with a missing left 
ear lobe. He’s working with a heavy, 
brown-haired partner — very light 
gray eyes.” 

“Not much to go on. How about 
a picture?” 

“1 had one but your phone num- 
ber’s too long.” 

McComb looked as if he were 
about to switch off so Johnny 
hurried to fill him in on the past 
two hours’ activity. 

“ ... so I mean to stay right here 
until you can round up a sheriff’s 
posse to escort me up to this 
‘Crater Ranch’,” Johnny finished. 

“It won’t work,” McComb said. 

“If it doesn’t, I won’t work either.” 

4 4 Tohnny, you wouldn’t look 

J natural without a fresh 
lump on your head. The police will 
agree with them. It’s no crime to 
take pity on a passing drunk. Be- 
sides, if there is anything to your 
idea, you won’t find it by parading 
through the gate with a carload of 
local police.” 

“Maybe they know a side door.” 
His sore arm hurt when he tried 
to feel his sore head with it. 

“I’ll pass this on to the United 
Control Authority but they’re in 
such a flap right now it’ll be days 



before they can get around to it 
unless we can give them something 
more definite,” McComb said. 

“I know it,” Johnny sighed. Evi- 
dence, nailed down and document- 
ed, is what it would take to get 
the powerful forces of the United 
Government moving. 

“Let me know when you have 
something,” McComb said. “I’ll be 
here at least all night. Where’re you 
going now?” 

“To the next booth. Carlotta’s 
impatient.” 

“Who?” 

“It may be noon in Kansas, Mac, 
but the Hawaiian moon is on the 
Maui surf. I’ll check back with you 
before midnight your time.” 

McComb looked resigned and 
was already reaching for another 
phone connection when Johnny 
switched off. 

“Why not try a squid taco with 
your beer?” said the bartender as 
Johnny disentangled himself from 
the curtains. 

“No thanks. Where can I rent a 
car?” 

“Oh, you won’t need to. This is 
the taxi stand. My cousin, Enrico’s 
out on a long run now though. You 
have plenty of time for dinner.” 

“I should have guessed,” Johnny 
said. “Did you say squid?” 

“Sure. Carlotta makes them. She 
says she gets tired of beef.” 

“Maybe I’d better have that 
dinner now.” It seemed the only 
way out. 

Carlotta popped through the 
swinging half-door from the kitchen 
like an animated beach ball and 
opened the curtains and door to

IF 




booth Dimiber two. The food was 
not really as bad as he had feared, 
although he skipped the tacos. Sev- 
eral attempts to elicit information 
from Carlotta on a variety of sub- 
jects from the Crater Ranch to a 
shrimp tail protruding from his 
enchalada resulted only in parox- 
ysms of giggles. 

F inally the bartender came over 
and offered helpfully, “Carlotta 
was raised the old way, you know. 
She never learned English until she 
was twelve and still doesn't speak 
it very well. We Portugese value 
tradition — she’ll make some one a 
fine wife.” 

More titters from the kitchen. 
“Portugese!” 

“Sure. This latin cuisine doesn’t 
come from a can.” 

“I knew the blood lines had mixed 
out here,” said Johnny, watching the 
girl clearing the table blushing round 
and pink. She squeaked another 
stifled giggle and the dancing eyes 
all but disappeared in two slanted 
slits. “I guess I should have noticed 
the name.” 

“Yes sir, mine’s Manuel.” He set 
a milk-colored liqueur on the table. 

Johnny examined the glass dubi- 
ously. He needed someone fast who 
knew the island intimately and this 
irregular little oriental at least had 
the advantage of being available. 
Aloud he said, “A latin accent can 
be very attractive in a girl.” 
Another choked shriek came 
from the kitchen and even Manuel 
looked surprised. “Oh no. Like all 
Fenner ladies for generations Car- 
lotta was taught only Hawaiian.” 



“Like you said, most tourists 
never get to see the real Hawaii,” 
Johnny said. “When will the taxi be 
back?” 

“Enrico had a fare to a little 
town on the other side of the island 
and there’s only the coast road 
because you can’t go over the 
mountain. Another two hours, may- 
be.” 

“You must make captives of 
quite a few customers then.” 

“Oh no!” Manuel looked really 
distressed seeing the reputation of 
his “real” Hawaii at stake. “I only 
have the delivery truck parked 
around back, but I’ll be glad to take 
you to our hotel.” 

Johnny considered a moment and 
leaned across the table. “Manuel, 
I’ll give you the price of a new 
delivery truck if you can get me on- 
to the Crater Ranch.” 

M anuel’s oblong eyes seemed to 
tilt a little more. “I have a 
delivery to make there tomorrow. 
My cousin has a food store . .” 

“I mean now.” 

“Tonight?” 

“You can pick out the truck.” He 
finally had Manuel’s total attention. 

The little bartender picked up a 
towel and slowly wiped the already 
spotless bartop. He inspected a clean 
glass and set it back on the shelf. 

“I got a cousin who has a car 
agency in Honolulu ...” 

“Fine, we’ll get the best truck he 
has — custom-made if you like.” 
“You know somebody up at the 
Crater?” asked Manuel, watching 
Johnny intently. 

“I just met a couple of guys from 

73 



THE CRATER 




there today in Honolulu. I want to 
surprise them.” 

“Carlotta,” Manuel called over hk 
shoulder still looking at Johnny. “I 
have to make a delivery. If any 
customers come in just serve them 
ar)d be pleasant.” 

‘She will,” said Johnny and an 
answering squeak floated back from 
the kitchen. 

IV 

A full moon flooded the island 
with twilight as they bounced 
out of the town in a little box- 
shaped truck with “Fenner’s Fine 
Foods” in faded red letters on the 
side. Johnny had been prepared for 
more sales resistance from the little 
Chinese, but Manuel had not said 
a word since he told Carlotta they 
were leaving. 

The enormous bulk of the moun- 
tain filled the sky ahead as they 
left the trees of the town behind 
and rolled through the flat sugar 
cane fields that filled the sea-level 
plains. The road sloped upward like 
a giant ski-jump, but the pitch here 
was so gradual that it was percep- 
tible only from the laboring truck 
engine. 

After a few miles the cane and 
the climate switched abruptly. The 
air was cooler and row after endless 
rov/ of squat pineapple plants 
stretched away in all directions. 
Now Johnny could see the whole 
island outlined with a necklace of 
lights around the water’s edge. The 
cane fields and beach made a base 
barely large enough to hold Halea- 
kala looming above them. 



After the pineapple fields, a few 
scraggly trees appeared that quickly 
gave way to low bushes and grass- 
land, as the pitch of the slope 
steepened and the road began to 
wind. It was already uncomfortably 
cool when they hit a layer erf 
scattered clouds about two thirds 
of the way up. Before coming out 
the top of the cloud, Manuel 
switched off the lights and slowed 
to a blind crawl. 

“Where are we?” Johnny asked. 

“The gate house is about ten miles 
ahead, but from here on cattle 
trails go all around the mountain. 
The floor of the crater is good 
grazing land, but no grass grows at 
the rim; so cattle inside never try 
to get out. There’s a trail along 
here somewhere that’ll take us up 
to the rim about half way around. 
You’ll have to walk from there, 
though.” 

They came out of the cloud and 
the road stretched away bright 
again in the moonlight. After a few 
hundred yards, Manuel turned sud- 
denly through the shallow ditch and 
bound off across an open field 
broken here and there by huge 
boulders that towered over the 
truck. 

“I don’t see any trail,” shouted 
Johnny over the rattle. He clutched 
at the side of the cab to stay in 
his seat. 

“Oh sure. Lived here all my life. 
We used to camp up here when we 
were kids. Just ken more minutes.” 

T wenty minutes later the truck 
bumped to a stop against an 
outcropping of rock and black lava

that not even Manuel was willing 
tc attempt. The truck sighed and 
wheezed gently as he shut off the 
engine. 

“Oh well, you’re getting me a 
new one,” said Manuel with satis- 
faction. “Come on,” and he got out 
and started up the lava flow. 

“Manuel,” Johnny hung back. 
“This is as far as you go. You must 
have gathered I’m not an invited 
guest here.” 

“But we’re not there yet.” The 
little Chinese stopped and looked 
back. 

“This is close enough. Here’s 
your new delivery truck,” Johnny 
said and held out a note he’d 
scribbled to McComb. 

Manuel scrambled back down the 
rocks and held the note close to 
read in the moonlight. He looked 
back at the rim of the crater once 
or twice and again at Johnny. 

“Who’s McComb?” he finally said. 

“He’s an official in the company 
I work for. That note will make 
sure your truck goes on my expense 
account.” 

“Mr. Andrews, I know those two 
‘cowboys’ you left in front of my 
place. I got a plate glass window, 
you know. They’ve been in before. 
Even Carlotta stays quiet. They 
wouldn’t know a steer from a wall- 
eyed fence post.” 

“If you were watching, why’d 
you’d come up here? Doesn’t Wai- 
luku have any police?” 

“Sure, my cousin Roberto. I’ll tell 
him about it tomorrow. Anyway, 
all I saw was you folding up that 
skinny guy and by me that’s a 
public service.” 



^'Listen, that big man is no sc^t 
touch, Manuel. If you’re caught up 
here with me, you could end up 
actually looking Portugese. I only 
want to see what kind of ranch gets 
hidden on top of a mountain with 
more people than cattle.” 

“I am Portugese.” Manuel paused 
and looked back past the jutting 
boulders at the ring of lights around 
Maui that twinkled up through the 
scattered cloud layer. 

“Mr. Andrews,” he said finally, 
“this is my island. We’ve been here 
since 1832 when an Irish ancestor 
was forced to leave Macao hur- 
riedly. Now four months ago these 
people just move in, put up gate 
houses, keep us out of our crater 
because they say they want to keep 
their breed pure. Why, this is the 
only place around here you can get 
away from that blasted Hawaiian 
eternal springtime! I’m curious, too.” 

M anuel slipped the note into his 
pocket with an air of finality 
and addressed himself again to the 
tumbled rocks. His shape appeared 
designed to portray, one of those 
small oriental gods of happiness in 
a spring pageant; but he bounced 
up the rocks like a basketball and 
Johnny was scrambling to keep up. 

They reached the narrow rim 
without warning and Johnny was 
not prepared for the sheer size of 
the view. The slick black lava fell 
away steeply from their feet but 
soon became grass as the curve of 
the gigantic bowl flattened out into 
a vast meadow broken here and 
there by dark house-sized cinder 
cones; mute ghosts of the last an-

IF 




cient dying breaths of the long dead 
volcano. 

Gleaming sparsely under the rim 
to their left, a lonely cluster of 
lights outlined the main ranch house. 
A few head of cattle huddled dark 
and motionless directly below them. 

“See. The cattle can’t cross the 
pahoehoe,” Manuel said. 

“That ought to keep the breed 
pure.” 

“Of course.” 

“Manuel, I just happen to know 
‘pahoehoe’ is slick lava, not a vow 
of celibacy. Skip the travelogue and 
let’s get closer.” 

They slid down the hard pahoe- 
hoe and started across the grass 
toward the distant lights. As they 
moved through some scattered 
cattle, Johnny noticed that two had 
lost most of the hair on one side 
as though from a radiation burn. 

About a hundred yards from the 
lighted compound they were stopped 
by a huge slab of concrete rising 
waist high from the ground and 
extending nearly to the compound. 
It was painted a dark color they 
couldn’t identify in the moonlight 
and hadn’t been noticeable until 
they walked up to it. Part way down 
the length of the slab sat a large 
pile of cinders looking pretty much 
like the rest of the cinder cones 
scattered over the valley floor. 

“They over-did the lanai,” John- 
ny said. “Was this here before?” 

“I don’t remember it. The ship- 
ping corral used to be along here.” 

T hey moved quietly along the 
smooth concrete closer to the 
ranch buildings. About the center 



of the slab a series of heavy con- 
duits extended from the edge and 
disappeared into the ground. At the 
end nearest the ranch house the 
earth was dug away to a depth of 
about ten feet, but the concrete 
apparently extended deeper than 
that. 

Near one corner of this pit some 
steps led down to a door in the end 
of the slab. 

Johnny paused part way down 
the steps where they could still see 
the ranch buildings, their eyes level 
with the top step. 

“All asleep,” muttered Manuel 
after a moment. 

The heavy steel door was held 
shut by a sliding latch bar but had 
no lock and opened easily when 
Johnny tried it. They entered an 
enormous corridor nearly the length 
of a football field, dimly lit from 
panels in the ceiling. The set-up was 
about what Johnny had expected to 
find somewhere around the islands, 
but infinitely larger than anything 
he had ever heard of. 

“What is it?” asked Manuel eyeing 
the rows of control panels with 
glowing jewel lights that stretched 
almost out of sight. 

“This is how you de-rail a space 
ship, my Latin friend. It’s the 
grandaddy of all radars. Those pipes 
we saw coming out of the slab must 
lead to an antenna laid along the 
ground. This whole crater is a giant, 
dish-shaped radar antenna! It’s so 
big they’re using an atomic pile for 
power. You ever heard of Marine 
Surety Incorporated?” 

“No, I already got insurance. My 
cousin ...” 



THE CRATER 



77 




“No matter, no matter. How 
about irillium hi-jaoking?” 

“Sure. It’s been in all the news 
for weeks. There was another one 
tonight.” Manuel looked apprehen- 
sive. “That what this is?” 

“That’s exactly what this is.” John- 
ny walked along to the main panel 
in the center of the corridor. “This 
monster ought to generate a pulse 
big enough to overpower a servo- 
signal five hundred miles away — 
and the ships are only about a 
hundred miles up when they come 
over here on the way in.” 

“I’m not as curious as I was.” 
Manuel edged toward the door. 

“Jus: a minute. I’ll leave a calling 
card.” He studied the rows of 
switches for a moment and then 
activated the main radar power-on 
toggle. The power indicator dial 
next to it stayed dead on zero. 

“I thought you only came to 
look,” Manuel said over his shoul- 
der. 

“Yes, I’m coming.” Johnny lin- 
gered at the big central control 
panel. Manuel was right. He did 
have what he came for. But Marine 
Surety didn’t pay salaries like his 
just for information. Besides, there 
was only one more step. 

Along the top of the control 
panel lay a row of positioning knobs 
glowing .with dull ferocity in the 
dim light. The row was labeled 
“Neutron Supress” and the pointer 
on each knob was turned to “Posi- 
tive Insert”. 

Johnny turned one toward “Ex- 
tract” and a rumbling buzz began 
under their feet. 

“This ought to do it,” he said and 



quickly flipped all the knobs over 
to full “Extract”. 

“Let’s do it outside, then,” said 
Manuel already at the door by then. 

“We should have at Icist ten 
minutes before anything goes,” 
Johnny said stepping through the 
door after him. 

V 

44XTOU ought to have more time 
I than that,” said a familiarly 
hoarse voice from the top of the 
steps. White Eyes stepped back 
from the center of the walk where 
he’d been standing and the moon- 
light glinted off the snout of a 
small hand gun almost lost in his 
over-sized fist. 

“Come on up.” It sounded almost 
hospitable. 

Johnny followed the small Chi- 
nese up the steps with the unhappy 
calculation that the two of them 
added together would not quite 
equal the big man even without the 
gun. 

“How’d you get here, anyway?” 
White Eyes asked as they reached 
the top. 

“Over the pahoehoe,” Johnny said 
indicating the center of the crater 
with his thumb. 

“The what?” White Eyes glanced 
out across the crater. 

By now they were in front of 
him. White Eyes was still looking 
across the moonlit crater from the 
top of the steps. Suddenly a rumble 
sounded through the open door they 
had just left. Reacting fast, Manuel’s 
almond eyes seemed to grow round 
with fear, and he screamed toward 



78 



IF 




an imaginary ally, “Run Roberto!” 
In spile of himself the big man 
turned and Johnny was in the air. 
He planted both feet on the man’s 
left kidney and snapped his legs 
straight. 

It felt like kicking a tree, but 
White Eyes was on his way down 
the steps as Johnny landed rolling. 
It wasn’t much of a head start, but 
it was enough. 

Johnny looked for Manuel and 
found him out in front already 
rounding the corner of the slab. By 
the time Johnny drew even with 
him they had left the slab behind 
and were racing across the floor 
of the crater. 

. .can’t outrun . nuclear 
blast!” Manuel panted. 

. won’t explode . just heat,” 
Johnny began to draw ahead. 

“. then . what’s the hurry?” 
“. we’re on . antenna . 
high power . before burns out 
. just run!” 

T hey raced through the motion- 
less cattle, leaving small flurries 
of startled activity. Glancing back, 
Johnny caught the flash of head- 
lights turning through the trees 
around the ranch house and shortly 
the hum 'of an automobile engine 
made a background to their pound- 
ing feet. 

The car zigzagged in their general 
direction avoiding livestock and 
probing with the thin white finger 
of a spotlight. Johnny, his breath 
coming now in long gasps was sur- 
prised to find Manuel still keeping 
up. 

The spotlight flashed across their 



backs, paused and snapped back to 
flood them with wavering splashing 
light as the car bounced around to 
head toward them. Wild arm and 
leg shadows leapt crazily ahead 
across the grass until they stabi- 
lized in silhouettes against the sharp- 
ly rising pahoehoe. Only a few steps 
more. 

A sharp snapping sound at his 
car and splinters of lava erupted 
from beside his shadow up ahead. 
Now nearly all the shadow climbed 
up on the wall of lava as they got 
closer. 

He drove his aching legs with 
all the strength he had left and 
watched the ridiculous shadow- 
dance on the wall like a soldier 
running in place and getting no- 
where. 

Another snap near his head and 
more lava shattered. The rapid 
tempo of Manuel’s drumming feet 
behind him increased even higher. 
Manuel took shorter steps but, 
seeming to have an inexhaustible 
supply of them, he went by like a 
motorboat. 

The pahoehoe here was cut by 
deep clefts; and they flung them- 
selves like flying rag dolls into the 
darkest one. 

Suddenly the hum of the car 
engine stopped. Johnny heard shouts 
and tried desperately to control his 
gasping breath enough to hear the 
words. Manuel lay propped on one 
arm. “Let’s go,” he wheezed. 

“No, wait. I think it’s coming!” 
Johnny said. 

“Well, I don’t want it. Let’s go,” 
and Manuel started crawling up the 
crevice. 



THE CRATER 



79 




"I mean we made it. Look!” 
Johnny was peering back over the 
edge of the pahoehoe. 

T he lights were out now on the 
car where it had stopped 
about a hundred yards away, shining 
black in the moonlight. Across the 
great bowl of the crater stretching 
away out of sight in the misty 
darkness wisps of smoke were be- 
ginning to appear making regular 
twenty foot squares as the grass 
charred black and here and there 
licked into flame. 

“But it’s extinct!” Manuel cried. 
“That isn’t the volcano — it’s, the 
antenna! I told you the wh^!^ crater 
is an enormous radar antenna. They 
just laid cables under the grass. It 
already had the right shape.” 

“I never saw a radar antenna do 
that.” 

“You never saw one get that 
much power. We left that nuclear 
pile out of control and going wild,” 
There was a flash from the car 
and bits of flying pahoehoe show- 
ered over them. The doors opened 
and two figures piled out. Johnny 
and Manuel ducked. 

Ihey heard a scream that died 
away quickly as if the screamer had 
lost interest part way through. No 
more shots. Johnny tried another 
cautious look and saw why. 

Now the black lines had all 
turned red and gave off a bluish 
glow. In the eerie light the two 



figures from the car lay scattered 
about halfway between the wall 
and the car. One lay where he had 
fallen across a cable and the red 
line of the cable appeared solidly 
unbroken where his chest had been. 
The other had dragged himself into 
the middle of a square; but his legs 
were ten feet away on the other 
side of the fiery red line. 

A heavy rumble came from the 
concrete slab which split open with 
a burst of smoke as they watched. 
Instantly the glowing checkerboard 
of the crater went dark. 

They crawled up the cleft in the 
wall keeping as much pahoehoe as 
possible between them and the 
crater, Johnny having begun to 
wonder how much radiation they 
might have picked up from the 
antenna display even before the 
power plant blew. 

“The company will kick through 
with a lot more than just a delivery 
truck for this night, Manuel,” John- 
ny said as they bumped back down 
the mountain. The old truck sagged 
a bit more than it had, but it ran 
rather well downhill. 

“Oh, it wasn’t for money. You’re 
just lucky you happened onto me. 
My cousin Renaldo says in the old 
days I should have been a sailor. 
Maybe I ought to go into space. 
Renaldo says I’m just the adven- 
turous type.” 

Johnny sighed, ^‘Probably it’s 
your Viking ancestors.” END

IF ♦ Short Story 



Patron of the Arts 

by FRED SABERHAGEN 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



The Berserkers loathed life — 
but life had the power of doing 
them one unduplicable service! 



A fter some hours’ work, Herron 
found himself hungry, and 
willing to pause for food. Looking 
over what he had just done, he 
could easily imagine one of the sy- 
cophantic critics praising it: A huge 
canvas, of discordant and brutal 
line, aflame with a sense of en- 
gulfing menace! And for once, Her- 
ron thought, the critic might be 
praising something good. 

Turning away from his view of 
easel and blank bulkhead, Herron 
found that his captor had moved 
up silently to stand only an arm’s 
length behind him, for all the world 
like some human kibitzer. 

He had to chuckle. ‘T suppose 
you’ve some idiotic suggestion to 
make?” 

The roughly man-shaped machine 
said nothing, though it had what 
might be a speaker mounted on 
what might be a face. Herron 



shrugged and walked around it, 
going forward in search of the 
galley. This ship had been only a 
few hours out from Earth on 
C-plus drive when the berserker 
machine had run it down and cap- 
tured it; and Piers Herron, the only 
passenger, had not yet had time to 
learn his way around. 

It was more than a galley, he 
saw when he reached it — it was 
meant to be a place where arty 
colonial ladies could sit and twitter 
over tea when they grew weary of 
staring at pictures. The Franz Hals 
had been built as a traveling muse- 
um; then the war of life against 
berserker machine had grown hot 
around Sol, and BuCulture had 
ineptly decided that Earth’s art 
treasures would be safer if shipped 
away to Tau Epsilon. The Franz 
was ideally suited for such a mis- 
sion, and for almost nothing else. 



81 




Looking further forward from 
the entrance to the galley, Heiron 
could see that the door to the crew 
compartment had been battered 
down, but he did not go to look 
inside. Not that it would bother him 
to look, he told himself; he was 
as indifferent to horror as he was 
to almost all other human things. 
The Franz's crew of two were in 
there, or what was left of them after 
they had tried to fight off the 
berserker’s boarding machines. 
Doubtless they had preferred death 
to capture. 

Herron preferred nothing. Now 
he was probably the only living 
being — apart from a few bacteria 
— within half a light year; and he 
was pleased to discover that his 
situation did not terrify him, that 
his long-growing weariness of life 
was not just a pose to fool himself. 

H is metal captor followed him 
into the galley, watching while 
he set the kitchen devices to work. 
‘'Still no suggestions?” Herron asked 
it. “Maybe you’re smarter than I 
thought.” 

“I am what rtien call a berserker,” 
the man-shaped thing said to him 
suddenly, in a squeaky, ineffectual- 
sounding voice. “I have captured 
your ship, and I will talk with you 
through this small machine you see. 
Do you grasp my meaning?” 

“I understand as well as I need 
to.” He knew his captor was an 
utterly alien and inanimate thing, 
built in some segment of time and 
space beyond human ken, built to 
fight in some ancient war between 
races who had never heard of 
82 



Earth, and who perhaps were long 
dead themselves. Now the berserker 
machines’ war was against all the 
life of the galaxy. 

Herron had not yet seen the 
berserker itself but he knew it 
would be a sphere the size of a 
planetoid, now a few miles away, 
or perhaps a few hundred or a thou- 
sand miles, from the ship it had 
captured. Captain Hanus had tried 
desperately to escape it, diving the 
Franz into a cloud of dark nebula 
where no ship or machine could 
move faster than light, and where 
the advantage in speed lay with the 
smaller hull. 

The chase had been at speeds up 
to a thousand miles a second. 
Forced to remain in normal space, 
the berserker could not steer its 
bulk among the meteoroids and 
gas-wisps as well as the Franz's 
radar-computer system could ma- 
neuver the fleeing ship. But the 
berserker had sent an armed launch 
of its own to take up the chase, 
and the weaponless Franz had had 
no chance. 

Now, dishes of food, hot and cold, 
popped out on a galley table, and 
Herron bowed to the machine. “Will 
you join me?” 

“I need no organic food.” 

Herron sat down with a sigh. “In 
the end,” he told the machine, 
“you’ll find that lack of humor is 
as pointless as laughter. Wait and 
see if I’m not right.” He began to 
eat, and found himself not so 
hungry as he had thought. Evidently 
his body still feared death — this 
surprised him a little. 

“Do you normally function in the 

IF 




operation of this ^ip?” the machine 
asked. 

“No,” he said, making himself 
chew and swallow. “I’m not much 
good at pushing buttons.” A pecu- 
liar thing that had happened was 
nagging at Herron. When capture 
was only minutes away, Captain 
Hanus had come dashing aft from 
the control room, grabbing Herron 
and dragging him along in a tearing 
hurry, aft past all the stored art 
treasures. 

“Herron, listen — if we don’t 
make it, see here?” Tooling open a 
double hatch in the stern compart- 
ment, the captain had pointed into 
what looked like a short padded 
tunnel, the diameter of a large drain 
pipe. “The regular lifeboat won’t get 
away, but this might.” 

“Are you waiting for the Second 
Officer, Captain, or leaving us 
now?” 

“There’s room for only one, you 
fool, and I’m not the one who’s 
going.” 

“You mean to save me? Captain, 
I’m touched!” Herron laughed, 
easily and naturally. “But don’t put 
yourself out.” 

“You idiot. Can I trust you?” 
Hanus lunged into the boat, his 
hands flying over its controls. Then 
he backed out, glaring like a mad- 
man. “Listen. Look here. This but- 
ton is the activator; now I’ve set 
things up so the boat should come 
out in the main shipping lanes and 
start sending a distress signal. 
Chances are she’ll be picked up 
safely then. Now the controls are 
set, only this activator button needs 
to be pushed down — ” 

PATRON OF THE ARTS 



The berserker’s launch had at- 
tacked at that moment, with a roar 
like mountains falling on the hull of 
the ship. The lights and the artificial 
gravity had failed and then come 
abruptly back. Piers Herron had 
been thrown on his side, his wind 
knocked out. He had watched while 
the Captain, regaining his feet and 
moving like a man in a' daze, had 
closed the hatch on the mysterious 
little boat again and staggered for- 
ward toward his control room. 

4C'll^hy are you here?” the ma- 
▼ V chine asked Herron. 

He dropped the forkful of food 
he had been staring at. He didn’t 
have to hesitate before answering 
the question. “Do you know what 
BuCulture is? They’re the fools in 
charge of Art, on Earth. Some of 
them, like a lot of other fools, think 
I’m a great painter. They worship 
me. When I said I wanted to leave 
Earth on this ship, they made it 
possible. 

“I wanted to leave because almost 
everything that is worthwhile in any 
true sense is being removed from 
Earth. A good part of it is on this 
ship. What’s left behind on the 
planet is only a swarm of animals, 
breeding and dying, fighting — ” he 
paused. 

“Why did you not try to fight 
or to hide when my machines board- 
ed this ship?” 

“Because it would have done no 
good.” 

When the berserker’s prize crew 
had forced their way in through an 
airlock, Herron had been setting up 
his easel in what was to have been 

83 




a small exhibition hall, and he had 
paused to watch the uninvited visi- 
tors file past. One of the man- 
shaped metal things, the one through 
which he was being questioned now, 
had stayed to stare at him through 
its lenses while the others had moved 
on forward to the crew compart- 
ment. 

“Herron!” the intercom had shout- 
ed. “Try, Herron, please! You know 
what to do!” Clanging noises fol- 
lowed, and gunshots and curses. 

What to do, Captain? Why, yes. 
The shock of events and the prom- 
ise of imminent death had stirred 
up some kind of life in Piers Herron. 
He looked with interest at the alien 
captor, the inhuman cold of deep 
space frosting over its metal here 
in the warm cabin. Then he turned 
away from it and began to paint 
the berserker, trying to catch not 
the outward shape he had never 
seen, but what he felt of its in- 
wardness. He felt the emotionless 
deadlines of its watching lenses 
boring into his back. The sensation 
was faintly pleasurable, like cold 
spring sunshine. 

iCTI^hat is good?” the machine 
▼ ▼ asked Herron, standing over 
him in the galley while he tried to 
eat. 

He snorted. “You tell me.” 

It took him literally. “To serve 
the cause of what men call death 
is good. To destroy life is good.” 

Herron pushed his nearly full 
plate into a disposal slot and stood 
up. “You’re almost right — but even 
if you were entirely right, why so 
enthusiastic? What is there praise- 
84 



worthy about death?” Now his 
thoughts surprised him as his lack 
of appetite had. 

“I am entirely right,” said the 
machine. 

For long seconds Herron stood 
still, as if thinking, though his mind 
was almost entirely blank. “No,” he 
said finally, and waited for a bolt 
to strike him. 

“In what do you think I am 
wrong?” it asked. 

“ni show you.” He led it out of 
the galley, his hands sweating and 
his mouth dry. Why wouldn’t the 
damned thing kill him and have 
done? 

The paintings were racked row 
on row and tier on tier; there was 
no room in the ship for more than 
a few to be displayed in a con- 
ventional way. Herron found the 
drawer he wanted and pulled it open 
so the portrait inside swung into full 
view, lights springing on around it 
to bring out the rich colors beneath 
the twentieth century statglass 
coating. 

“This is where you’re wrong,” 
Herron said. 

The man-shaped thing’s scanner 
studied the portrait for perhaps 
fifteen seconds. “Explain what you 
are showing me,” it said. 

“I bow to you!” Herron did so. 
“You admit ignorance! You even 
ask an intelligible question, if one 
that is somewhat too broad. Explain, 
you say. First, tell me what you 
see here.” 

“I see the image of a life-unit, 
its third spatial dimension of negli- 
gible size as compared to the other 
two. The image is sealed inside a

protective jacket transparent to the 
wavelengths used by the human eye. 
The life-unit imaged is, or was, an 
adult male apparently in good func- 
tional condition, garmented in a 
manner I have not seen before. 
What I take to be one garment is 
held before him — ” 

“You see a man with a glove,” 
Herron cut in, wearying of his bitter 
game. “That is the title, Man With 
A Glove. Now what do you say it 
means?” 

There was a pause of twenty 
seconds. “Is it an attempt to praise 
life, to say that life is good?” 

L ooking now at Titian’s eight 
hundred year old more-than- 
masterpiece, Herron for the mo- 
ment hardly heard what the machine 
was saying; he was thinking help- 
lessly and hopelessly of his own 
most recent work. 

“Now you will tell me what it 
means,” said the machine without 
emphasis. 

Herron walked away without 
answering, leaving the drawer open. 

The berserker’s mouthpiece walk- 
ed at his side. “Tell me what it 
means or you will be punished.” 

“Tf you can pause to think, so can 
I.” 3ut Herron’s stomach had knot- 
ted up at the threat of punishment, 
seeming to feel that pain mattered 
eyen more than death. Herron had 
great contempt for his stomach. 

His feet took him back to his 
easel. Looking at the discordant and 
brutal line that a few minutes ago 
had pleased him, he now found it 
IS disgusting as everything else he 
had tried to do in the past year.

The berserker asked: “What have 
you made here?” 

Herron picked up a brush he had 
forgotten to clean, and wiped at 
it irritably. 

“It is my attempt to get at your 
essence, to capture you with paint 
and canvas as you have seen those 
humans captured.” He waved at the 
storage racks. “My attempt has 
failed, as most do.” 

There was another pause, which 
Herron did not try to time. 

“An attempt to praise me?” 

Herron broke the spoiled brush 
and threw it down. “Call it what 
you like.” 

This time the pause was short, 
and at its end the machine did not 
speak, but turned away and walked 
in the direction of the airlock. Some 
of its fellows clanked past to join 
it. From the direction of the air- 
lock there began to come sounds 
like those of heavy metal being 
worked and hammered. The inter- 
rogation seemed to be over for the 
time being. 

Herron’s thoughts wanted to be 
anywhere but on his work or on 
his fate, and they returned to what 
Hanus had shown him, or tried to 
show him. Not a regular lifeboat, 
but she might gel away, the captain 
had said. All it needs now is to 
press the button. 

Herron started walking, smiling 
faintly as he realized that if this 
berserker was as careless as it 
seemed, he might possibly escape 
it. 

Escape to what? He couldn’t 
paint any more, if he ever could. 
All that really mattered to him now 

IF 




was here, and on other ships leaving 
Earth. 

Back at the storage rack, Herron 
swung the Man With A Glove out 
so its case came free from the rack 
and became a handy cart. He 
wheeled the portrait aft. There 
might yet be one worthwhile thing 
he could do with his life. 

T he picture was massive in its 
statglass shielding, but he 
thought he could fit it into the boat. 

As an itch might nag a dying man, 
the question of what the captain 
had been intending with the boat 
nagged Herron. Hanus hadn’t seem- 
ed worried about Herron’s fate, but 
instead had spoken of trusting Her- 
ron . 

Nearing the stern, unwatched by 
the machines, Herron passed a 
strapped-down stack of crated stat- 
uary, and heard a noise, a rapid 
feeble pounding. 

It took several minutes to find 
and open the proper case. When he 
lifted the lid with its padded lining, 
a girl wearing a coverall sat up, her 
hair all wild as if standing in terror. 

“Are they gone?” She had bitten 
at her fingers and nails until they 
were bleeding. When he didn’t an- 
swer at once, she repeated her 
question again and again, in a rising 
whine. 

“The machines are still here,” he 
said at last. 

Literally shaking in her fear, she 
climbed out of the case. “Where’s 
Gus? Have they taken him?” 
“Gus?” But he thought he was 
beginning to understand. 

“Gus Hanus, the captain. He and 



I are — he was trying to save me, 
to get me away from Earth.” 

“I’m quite sure he’s dead,” said 
Herron. “He fought the machines.” 
Her bleeding fingers clutched at 
her lower face. “They’ll kill us, too. 
Or worse! What can we do?” 

“Don’t mourn your lover so deep- 
ly,” he said. But the girl seemed 
not to hear him; her wild eyes 
looked this way and that, expecting 
the machines. “Help me with this 
picture,” he told her calmly. “Hold 
the door there for me.” 

She obeyed as if half-hypnotized, 
not questioning what he was doing. 

“Gus said there’d be a boat,” she 
muttered to herself. “If he had to 
smuggle me down to Tau Epsilon 
he was going to use a special little 
boat — ” She broke off, staring at 
Herron, afraid that he had heard 
her and would steal her boat. As 
indeed he was going to do. 

When he had the painting in the 
stern compartment, he stopped. He 
looked long at the Man With A 
Glove, but in the end all he could 
seem to see was that the fingertips 
of the ungloved hand were not 
bitten bloody. 

Herron took the shivering girl 
by the arm and pushed her into the 
tiny boat. She huddled there in her 
dazed terror; she was not good- 
looking. He wondered what Hanus 
had seen in her. 

“There’s room for only one,” he 
said, and she shrank and bared her 
teeth as if afraid he meant to drag 
her out again. “After I close the 
hatch, push that button there, the 
activator. Understand?” 

That she understood at once. He 

87 



PATRON OF THE ARTS 




dogged the double hatch shut, and 
waited. Only about three seconds 
passed before there came a soft 
scraping sound that he supposed 
meant that the boat had gone. 

XTearby was a tiny observation 
J ^ blister, and Herron put his 
head into it and watched the stars 
turn beyond the dark blizzard of 
the nebula. After a while he saw 
the berserker through the blizzard, 
turning with the stars, black and 
rounded and bigger than any moun- 
tain. It gave no sign that it had 
detected the tiny boat slipping away. 
Its launch was very near the Franz 
but none of the commensal machines 
were in sight. 

Looking the Man With A Glove 
in the eye, Herron pushed him for- 
ward again, to a spot near his 
easel. The discordant lines of 
Herron’s own work were now worse 
than disgusting, but Herron made 
himself work on them. 

He hadn’t time to do much 
before the man-shaped machine 
came walking back to him; the 
uproar of metalworking had ceased. 
Wiping his brush carefully, Herron 
put it down, and nodded at his 
berserker-portrait. “When you des- 
troy all the rest, save this painting. 
Carry it back to those who built 
you, they deserve it.” 

The machine-voice squeaked back 
at him: “Why do you think I will 
destroy paintings? Even if they are 
attempts to praise life, they are dead 
things in themselves, and so in 
themselves they are good.” 

Herron was suddenly too fright- 



ened and weary to speak. Looking 
dully into the machine’s lenses, he 
saw there tiny flickerings, keeping 
time with his own pulse and breath- 
ing, like the indications of a lie- 
detector. 

“Your mind is divided,” said the 
machine. “But with its much greater 
part you have praised me. I have 
repaired your ship, and set its 
course. I now release you, so other 
life-units can learn from you to 
praise what is good.” 

Herron could only stand there 
staring straight ahead of him, while 
a trampling of metal feet went past, 
and there was a final scraping on 
the hull. 

After some time he realized he 
was alive and free. 

At first he shrank from the dead 
men, but after once touching them 
he soon got them into a freezer. 
He had no particular reason to 
think either of them Believers, but 
he found a book and read Islamic, 
Ethical, Christian and Jewish burial 
services. 

Then he found an undamaged 
handgun on the deck, and went 
prowling the ship, taken suddenly 
with the wild notion that a machine 
might have stayed behind. Pausing 
only to tear down the abomination 
from his easel, he went on to the 
very stern. There he had to stop, 
facing the direction in which he 
supposed the berserker now was. 

“Damn you, I can change!” he 
shouted at the stern bulkhead. His 
voice broke. “I can paint again. I’ll 
show you ... I can change. I am 
alive.” END

SKYLARK 

DuQUESNE 

by EDWARD E. SMITH, Ph.D. 



Illustrated by MORROW 



Across the great galaxies Seaton and 
DuQuesne battled — whole races their 
pawns — and the universe their prize! 



S eaton, halfway to the headsets, 
paused, stunned. That strident 
roar of klaxons was a noise he had 
not expected ever to hear except in 
test. It was the dire warning that 
the life of the Valeron's defensive 
screens was to be measured in sec- 
onds and but few of them. 

**Yipe!” he yelled then. “Control- 
room fastV^ His voice of course went 



unheard in the clamor of the horns; 
but his yelling had been purely re- 
flexive, anyway. While uttering the 
first syllable he was energizing 
beams of force that hurtled all eight 
of the party through ultra-high-speed 
locks that snapped open in front of 
them and crashed shut behind them 
— down into the neutral-gray cham- 
ber at the base of the giant Brain.

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE — 



The deadliest enemies in the universe are Richard Seaton and Marc C. DuQuesn# 
• . but they have patched together their feud in order to join against strange enemies 
from space. 

Seaton enters the partnership with open eyes: He knows that Blackie DuQuesne is his 
enemy. But he also knows that, next to Seaton himself, he is perhaps the ablest human 
being alive — and his brains and fighting fury will be needed. DuQuesne, on the other 
hand, has lost to Seaton too many times before to risk a move against him without every 
advantage he can get. It was Seaton who imprisoned him in a stasis of pure force, from 
which he escaped only through the combination of fortune and the superhuman skills of 
the disembodied intelligences who were his fellow exiles. The partnership is as un&table at 
mercury fulminate; but while they are together, Seaton and DuQuesne are a team that 
has no equal in the cosmos. 

And they need all their resources. For space is filled with races driven by their 
destinies into conflict with humanity — the Jelmi, strange humans from another galaxy; the 
Liurdi, their batlike overlords . and an enemy stranger and more deadly still. 

But DuQuesne has completed his plans. With the aid of a new fourth-dimensional 
translator invented by the Jelmi he is confident he can take Seaton. He sends six hired 
gunmen through the fourth dimension to kill Seaton and his friends. 

But the gunmen fail. In that same moment, another enemy strikes: At fantastically 
long range an undetected spaceship is attacking them with destroying rays . and their 
defenses are going downl 



Seaton rammed his head into his 
master controller and began furious- 
ly but accurately to think . and 
as he sat there, face harsh and white 
and strained, a vast structure of 
inoson, interlaced with the heaviest 
fields of force generable by the 
Valeron's mighty engines, came into 
being around the Brain and the other 
absolutely vital components of the 
worldlet’s core. 

After a few minutes of fantastic 
effort Seaton sighed gustily and tried 
to grin. “We’re holding ’em and 
we’re getting away,” he said, “But 1 
had to let ’em whittle us down to 
just about a nub before I could 

90 



spare power enough to grab a lunch 
off of them while they were getting 
a square meal off of us.” 

He spoke the exact truth. The at- 
tack had been so incredibly violent 
that in order to counter it he had had 
to apply the full power of the Val~ 
eron, designed to protect a surface 
of over three million square kilom- 
eters, to an area of less than thirty 
thousand. 

“But what was it, Dick?” Dorothy 
shrieked. “What could it have been 
— possibly?” 

“I don’t know. But you realize, 
don’t you, that it was two separate, 
unrelated attacks? Not one?” 

IF 




“Why, I ... I don’t think I realize 
anything yet.” 

“Those guns were Colts,” Seaton 
said, flatly. “Forty-fives. Made in 
the U. S. A. So that part of it was 
DuQuesne’s doing. He wanted — still 
wants — the Valeron. Bad. But those 
super-energy super-weapons were 
definitely something else — as sure as 
God made apples. No possible ship 
could put that much stuff out, let 
alone DuQuesne’s Capital D. So the 
question rises and asks itself — ” 

“Just a minute, Dick!” Crane 
broke in. “Even granting so extra- 
ordinary a coincidence as two sep- 
arate attacks — ” 

“Coincidence, hell!” Seaton snar- 
led. “There is no such thing. And 
why postulate an impossibility when 
you’ve got Blackie DuQuesne? He 
sucked me in, as sure as hell’s a 
mantrap — you can bet your case 
buck on that. And he outfoxed him- 
self doing it, for all the tea in 
China!” 

“What do you mean, Dick?” Dor- 
othy demanded. “How could he 
have?” 

“Plain as the nose on . plainer! 
He got it from somewhere, the son 
of a — ” Seaton bit the noun savage- 
ly off — “probably from Klazmon, 
that Galaxy DW-427-LU up ahead 
there that we were heading for is 
full of bad Indians. So he honeyed 
up to the Jelmi, got that fourth-di- 
mensional gadget off of them and 
tried to kill us with it. And he would 
have succeeded, except for the pure 
luck of our having lowered our 
gravity so drastically on account of 
Dunark and Sitar.” 

“I see,” Crane said. “And the In- 



dians jumped us when he pulled the 
trigger — perhaps attracted by his 
use of the ‘gadget’.” 

“That’s my guess, anyway,” Sea- 
ton admitted. “DuQuesne thought 
he was allowing plenty of leeway in 
both time and space for his oper- 
ation. But he wasn’t. He had no 
more idea than we did. Mart, that 
any such forces as those could pos- 
sibly be delivered at such extreme 
tange. And one simple, easy lie — 
the coordinates of the Llurdan gal- 
axy — was all he had to tell me and 
defend against my probe.” 

D uQuesne’s attention was wren- 
ched from his timer by a glare 
of light from a visiplate. He glanced 
at it, his jaw dropping in surprise; 
then his hands flashed to the con- 
trols of his fourth-dimensional 
transmitter and his six men ap- 
peared — four of them gruesomely 
headless. For a moment all six stood 
stiffly upright; then, as the sup- 
porting forces vanished, all six bod- 
ies slumped bonelessly to the floor. 

DuQuesne, after making quickly 
sure that the two were in fact as dead 
as were the four, shrugged his shoul- 
ders and flipped the bodies out into 
deep space. Then, donning prac- 
tically opaque goggles, he studied 
the incandescently glaring plate — 
to see that the Skylark of Valeron 
now looked like a minor sun. 

Involuntarily he caught his breath. 
The Vale ran* s screens were failing 
— failing fast. Course after course, 
including her mighty zones of force, 
her every defensive layer was flaring 
into and through the violet and go- 
ing black. 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



91 




DuQuesne clenched his fists; set 
his teeth so hard that his jaw-muscles 
stood out in bands and lumps. Any- 
thing to put out that much of that 
kind of stuff would have to be vast 
indeed. Incredibly vast. Nothing 
could be that big — nothing even per- 
taining, as far as DuQuesne knew, 
to any civilization or culture of the 
known universe. 

Relaxing a little, he assembled a 
working projection, but before send- 
ing it out he paused in thought. 

Seaton hadn’t attacked; he wasn’t 
the type to. He wouldn’t have, even 
if he could have done so at that 
range. So the strangers, whoever or 
whatever they might be, were the ag- 
gressors, with a capital “A”. Guilty of 
unprovoked and reasonless aggres- 
sion; aggression in the first degree. 
So what Tammon had told him about 
that galaxy being dominated by ‘'in- 
imical life-forms” was the under- 
statement of the year. And he, Du- 
Quesne himself, had triggered the at- 
tack; the fact that it had followed his 
own attack so nearly instantly made 
that a certainty. How had he trig- 
gered it? Almost certainly by the use 
of the fourth-dimensional transmit- 
ter .. 

But howl He didn’t know and he 
couldn’t guess . and at the mo- 
ment it didn’t make a lick of differ- 
ence. He hadn’t used any sixth-order 
stuff since then and he sure wouldn’t 
use any now for a good while. If he 
did anything at all, he’d pussyfoot 
it, but good. He didn’t want any part 
of anything that could manhandle 
the Skylark of Valeron like that. His 
Capital D was small enough and far 
enough back — ^he hoped 1 — to avoid 



detection. No he wouldn’t do a single 
damn thing except look on. 

F ascinated, DuQuesne stared into 
the brilliance of his plate. All 
the Valeron's screens were down 
now. Even the ultra-powerful inner- 
most zone — the wall shield itself, the 
last line of defense of the bare syn- 
thetic of the worldlet’s outer skin — 
was going fast. Huge black areas ap- 
peared, but they were black only 
momentarily. Such was the power of 
that incredible assault that thou- 
sands of tons of inoson flared in an 
instant into ragingly incandescent 
vapor; literally exploding; exploding 
with such inconceivable violence as 
to blast huge masses of solid inoson 
out of the Valeron’s thick skin and 
hurl them at frightful speed out into 
space. 

And the Valeron was not fighting 
back. She couldn’t. 

This fact, more than anything 
else, rocked DuQuesne to the core 
and gave him the measure of the 
power at the disposal of the “inimi- 
cal” entities of that galaxy. For he, 
knowing the Valeron's strength, now 
knew starkly that she was being at- 
tacked by forces of a magnitude 
never even approximated by the 
wildest imaginings of man. 

Scowling in concentration, he kept 
on watching the disaster. Watched 
while those utterly unbelievable 
forces peeled the Valeron down like 
an onion, layer after kilometer-thick 
layer. Watched until that for which 
he had almost ceased to hope finally 
took place. The Valeron, down now 
to the merest fraction of her original 
size — burned and blasted down to 



92 



IF 




the veriest core — struck back. And 
that counterstroke was no love-tap. 
The ether and all the subethers 
seethed and roiled under the ve- 
hemence of that devastating bolt of 
energy. 

The Skylark of Valeron vanished 
from DuQuesne’s plate; that plate 
went black; and DuQuesne stood up 
and stretched the kinks out of his 
muscles. Seaton could of course flit 
away on the sixth; but he, Du- 
Quesne, couldn’t. Not without be- 
ing detected and getting burned to 
a crisp. Against the forces that he 
had just seen in action against the 
Skylark of Valeron, DuQuesne’s own 
Capital D didn’t stand the proverbial 
chance of the nitrocellulose dog 
chasing the asbestos cat in hell. 

If the Skylark of Valeron had been 
hurt, half-demolished and reduced 
to an irreducible core of fighting 
muscle before it could mount one 
successful counter-blow against this 
new and unexpected enemy, then the 
Capital D would be reduced to its 
primitive gases. DuQuesne rapidly, 
soberly and accurately came to the 
conclusion that he simply did not 
own ship enough to play in this 
league. Not yet . 

Wherefore he pussyfooted it away 
from there at an acceleration of only 
a few lights; and he put many par- 
secs of distance between himself and 
the scene of recent hostilities before 
he cut in his space-annihilating sixth- 
order drive and began really to 
travel. He did not know whether 
Seaton and his party were surviv- 
ing; he did not care. He did not 
know the identity of the race which 
had hurt them so badly, so fast. 



What DuQuesne knew was that, as 
a bare minimum, he needed some- 
thing as big as the Valeron, plus the 
fourth-dimensional tricks he had 
learned from the Jelmi, plus a highly 
developed element of caution based 
on the scene he had just witnessed. 
And he knew what to do about it, 
and where to go to do it; wherefore 
his course was laid for the First Gal- 
axy and Earth. 

H undreds of thousands, of parsecs 
away from the scene of disas- 
ter, Seaton cut his drive and began 
gingerly to relax the terrific power 
of his defensive screens. 

No young turtle, tentatively pok- 
ing his head out of his shell to see 
if the marauding gulls had left, was 
more careful than Seaton. He had 
been caught off base twice. He did 
not propose to let it happen again. 

Another man might have raged 
and sworn at DuQuesne for his 
treachery; or panicked at the fear 
inspired by the fourth-dimensional 
transmitter DuQuesne had come up 
with, or the massive blow that had 
fallen from nowhere. Seaton did not. 
The possibility — no, the virtual cer- 
tainty — of treachery from DuQuesne 
he had accepted and discounted in 
the first second of receiving Du- 
Quesne’s distress call. He had ac- 
cepted the risks, and grimly calcu- 
lated that in any encounter, how- 
ever treacherous, DuQuesne would 
fail; and he had been right. The 
sudden attack from out of nowhere, 
however, was something else again. 
What made it worse was not that 
Seaton had no idea of its source or 
reason. The thing that caused his 



94 



IF 




eyes to narrow, his face to wear a 
hard, thoughtful scowl was that he 
in fact had a very good idea indeed 
— and he didn’t like it. 

But for the moment they were 
free. Seaton checked and double- 
checked every gauge and warning 
device and nodded at last. 

“Good,” he said then, “I was 
more than half expecting a kick in 
the pants, even way out here. The 
next item on our agenda is a coun- 
cil of war; so cluster ’round, every- 
body, and get comfortable.” He 
turned control over to the Brain, sat 
down beside Dorothy, stroked his 
pipe, and went on: 

“Point one; DuQuesne. He got 
stuff somewhere — virtually certain- 
ly from the Jelmi — at least the 
fourth-dimensional transmitter and 
we don’t know what else, that he 
didn’t put out anything about. Nat- 
urally. And he sucked me in like 
Mary’s little lamb. Also naturally. 
At hindsight I’m a blinding flash 
and a deafening report. I’ve got a 
few glimmerings, but you’re the 
brain. Mart; so give out with analy- 
sis and synthesis.” 

Crane did so; covering the essen- 
tial points and concluding: “Since 
the plug-chart was accurate, the 
course was accurate. Therefore, be- 
sides holding back vital information, 
DuQuesne lied about one or both of 
two things: the point at which the 
signal was received and the direc- 
tion from which it came.” 

“Well, you can find out about 
that easily enough,” Dorothy said. 
“You know, that dingus you catch 
light- waves with, so as to see exact- 
ly what went on years and years ago. 



Or wouldn’t it work, this far away?” 

Seaton nodded. “Worth a try. 
Dunark?” 

“I say go after DuQuesne!” the 
Osnomian said viciously. “Catch him 
and blow him and his Capital D to 
hellangone up!” 

Seaton shook his head. “I can’t 
buy that — at the moment. Now that 
he's flopped again at murder, I don’t 
think he’s of first importance any 
more. You see, I haven’t mentioned 
Point Two yet, which is a datum I 
didn’t put into the pot because I 
wanted to thrash Point One out first. 
It’s about who the enemy really are. 
When I finally got organized to 
slug them a good one back, I fol- 
lowed the shot. They knew they’d 
been nudged, believe me. So much 
so that in the confusion I got quite 
a lot of information. They’re Chlor- 
ans. Of, if not exactly like the Chlor- 
ans of Chlora, that we had all the 
trouble with, as nearly identical as 
makes no difference.” 

a^hlorans!” Dorothy and Mar- 
garet shrieked as one, and 
five minds dwelt briefly upon that 
hideous and ultimately terrible race 
of amoeboid monstrosities who, liv- 
ing in an atmosphere of gaseous 
chlorine, made it a point to enslave 
or to destroy all the humanity of all 
the planets they could reach. 

All five remembered, very vividly, 
the starkly unalloyed ferocity which 
one race of Chlorans had attacked 
the planet Valeron; near which the 
Skylark of Valeron had been built 
and after which she had been named. 
They remembered the horrifyingly 
narrow margin by which those ChlcM*- 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



95 




ans hftd been defeated. They also re- 
membered that the Chlorans had 
not even then been slaughtered. The 
Skylarkers had merely enclosed the 
planet Chi ora in a stasis of time and 
sent ii back — on a trip that would 
last, for everyone and everything 
outside that stasis, some four hun- 
dred years — to its own native solar 
system, from which it had been torn 
by a near-collision of suns in the 
longgone past. The Skylarkers 
should have blown Chlora into im- 
palpable and invisible debris, and 
ihe men of the party had wanted to 
do just that, but Dorothy and Mar- 
garet and the essentially gentle Val- 
eronians had been dead set against 
genocide. 

Dorothy broke the short silence. 
“But how could they be, Dick?” she 
asked. “ ‘Way out here? But of 
course, if we human beings could 
do it — ” She paused. 

“But of course,” Seaton agreed 
sourly. “Why not? Why shouldn’t 
they be as widespread as humanity 
is? Or even more so, if they have 
killed enough of us off? And why 
shouldn’t they be smarter than those 
others were? Look at how much 
we’ve learned in just months, not 
millenia, of time.” 

Another and longer silence fell; 
which was broken by Seaton. “Well, 
two things are certain. They’re rab- 
idly anti-social and they’ve got — 
at the moment — a lot more stuff 
than we have. They’ve got it to sell, 
like farmers have hay. It’s also a 
dead-sure cinch that we can’t do a 
thing — not anything — ^without a lot 
more data than we have now. It’ll 
take all the science of Norlamin 



and maybe a nickel’s worth besides 
to design and build what we’ll have 
to have. And they can’t go it blind 
Nobody can. And we all know 
enough about Chlorans to know that 
we won’t get one iota or one of 
Peg’s smidgeons of information out 
of them by remote control. At the 
first touch of any kind of a high- 
order feeler they’ll bat our ears down 
. to a fare-thee-well. However, 
other means are available.” 

And he glanced at a monitor 
where for some minutes a display 
had shown a planet of the galaxy 
from which their recent attacker 
had come. 

D uring this fairly long — for Sea- 
ton — speech, and during th6 
silence that had preceded it, two 
things had been happening. 

First the controlling Brain of the 
ship had been carrying out a pro- 
gram of Seaton’s Star by star, sys- 
tem by system, it had been scan- 
ning the components of the nearest 
galaxy to the scene of their encoun- 
ter. It had in fact verified Seaton’s 
conclusions: the galaxy was domi- 
nated by Chlorans. Their works 
were everywhere. But it had also 
supported a — not a conclusion; a 
hope, more accurately — that Sea- 
ton had hardly dared put in words. 
Although the Chlorans ruled this 
galaxy. There were oxygen-breath- 
ing, warm-blooded races in it too 
— serfs of the Chlorans of course, 
but nevertheless occupying their own 
planets — and it was one such 
planet that the Brain had finally 
selected and was now displaying on 
its monitor.

The other thing wes that the au- 
burn-haired beauty who was Mrs. 
Richard Ballinger Seaton had been 
eyeing her husband steadily. At first 
she had merely looked at him 
thoughtfully. Then look and mien 
had become heavily tinged, first with 
surprise and then with doubt and 
then with wonder; a wonder that 
turned into an incredulity that be- 
came more and more incredulous. 
Until finally, unable to hold herself 
in any longer, she broke in on him. 

“Dick!” she cried. “You wouldn't! 
You know you wouldn’t!” 

“I wouldn’t? If not, who . .?” 
Changing his mind between two 
words, Seaton cut the rest of the 
sentence sharply off; shrugged his 
shoulders; and grinned, somewhat 
shamefacedly, back at her. 

At this point Crane, who had been 
looking first at one of them and 
then at the other, put in: “I real- 
ize, Dorothy, that you and Dick 
don’t need either language or head- 
sets to communicate with each other, 
but how about the rest of us? What, 
exactly, is it that you’re not as sure 
as you’d like to be that he wouldn’t 
do?” 

Dorothy opened her mouth to 
reply, but l^aton beat her to it. 
“What I would do — and will be- 
cause I’ll have to; because it’s my 
oyster and nobody else’s — is, after 
we sneak up as close as we can 
without touching off any alarms, 
take a landing craft and go get the 
data we absolutely have to have in 
absolutely the only way it can be 
gotten.” 

“And that’s what I most emphat- 
ically do not like!” Dorothy blazed. 



“Dick Seaton, you are not going ta 
land on an enslaved planet, alone 
and unarmed and afoot, as an in- 
vestigating Committee of One! F&r 
one thing, we simply don’t have the 
time! Do we? I mean, poor old 
Valeron is simply a wreck! We’ve 
got to go somewhere and — ” 

But Seaton was shaking his head. 
“The Brain can handle that by it- 
self,” he said. “All it needs is time. 
As a matter of fact, you’ve put your 
finger on a first-rate reason for my 
going in, alone. There’s simply not 
much else we can do until the VaU 
eron is back in shape again.” 

“Not your going in.” Dorothy 
blazed. “Flatly, positively no.” 

Again Seaton shrugged his shoul- 
ders. “I can’t say I’m madly in love 
with the idea myself, but who’s any 
better qualified? Or as well? Be- 
cause I know that you, Dottie, aren*lt 
the type to advocate us sitting on otjt 
hands and letting them have all the 
races of humanity, wherever sit- 
uate. So who?” 

“Me,” Shiro said, promptly if un- 
grammatically. “Not as good, but 
good enough. You can tell me what 
data you want and I can and will 
get it, just as well as . 

“Bounce back, both of you, you’ve 
struck a rubber fence!” Dunark 
snapped. “That job’s for Sitar 
and me.” The green-skinned princess 
waved her pistol in the air and 
nodded her head enthusiastically 
her warlord went on, “You and 1 
being brain-brothers, Dick, I’d knr w 
exactly what you want. And she and 
I would blast — ” 

“Yeah, that’s what 1 know danm 
well you’d do.” Seaton broke in.

only to be interrupted in turn by 
Crane — ^who was not in the habit of 
interrupting anyone even once, to 
say nothing of twice. 

‘'Excuse me, everyone,” he said, 
“but you’re all wrong, I think. My 
thought at the moment, Dick, is that 
your life is altogether too import- 
ant to the project as a whole to be 
risked as you propose risking it. As 
to you others, with all due respect 
for your abilities, I do not believe 
that either of you is as well qualified 
for this kind of an investigation as 
I am—” 

Margaret leaped to her feet in pro- 
test, but Crane went quietly on: “ — 
in either experience or training. 
However, we should not decide that 
point yet — or at all, for that matter. 
We are all too biased. I therefore 
suggest, Dick, that we feed the Brain 
everything we have and keep on 
feeding it everything pertinent we 
can get hold of, until it has enough 
data to make that decision for us.” 

**That makes sense,” Seaton said, 
and both Dorothy and Margaret 
nodded — but both with very evi- 
dent reservations. “The first time 
anything has made sense today!” 

XV 

Ky-El Mokak the Wilder 

T he first thing Seaton and Crane 
had to do, of course, was to 
figure out how to get back some- 
where near Galaxy DW-427-LU, 
within fourth-order range of that 
one particular extremely powerful 
Chloran system, without using 
enough sixth-order stuff to touch 



off any alarms — ^but still enough to 
make the trip in days instead of in 
months. Some sixth-order emana- 
tions could be neutralized by prop- 
erly phased and properly placed 
counter-generators; the big question 
being, how much? 

The answer turned out to be, ac- 
cording to Crane, “Not enough” 
— but, according to Seaton, “Satis- 
factory”. At least, it did make the 
trip not only possible, but feasible. 
And during the days' of that trip 
each Skylarker worked — with the 
Brain or with a computer or with 
pencil and paper or with paint or 
India ink and a brush, each accord- 
ing to his bent — on the problem of 
what could be done about the Chlor- 
ans. 

They made little headway, if any 
at all. They did not have enough 
data. Inescapably, the attitude of 
each was very strongly affected by 
what he or she knew about the 
Chlorans they had already encoun- 
tered. They were all smart enough 
to know that this was as indefen- 
sible as it was inevitable. 

Thus, while each of them devel- 
oped a picture completely unlike 
anyone else’s as to what the truth 
probably was, none of them was 
convinced enough of the validity of 
his theory to defend it vigorously. 
Thus it was discussion, not argu- 
ment, that went on throughout the 
cautious approach to the forbidden 
territory and the ultra-cautious in- 
vestigation of the Tellus-type planet 
the Brain had selected through 
powerful optical telescopes and by 
means of third- and fourth-order 
apparatus. Then they fell silent, ap-

palled; for that world was inhab- 
ited by highly intelligent human be- 
ings and what had been done to it 
was shocking indeed. 

T hey had seen what had been 
done to the planet Valeron. 
This was worse; much worse. On 
Valeron the ruins had been recog- 
nizable as having once been cities. 
Even those that had been blown up 
or slagged down by nuclear energies 
had shown traces of what they had 
once been. There had been rem- 
nants and fragments of structural 
members, unfused portions of the 
largest buildings, recognizable out- 
lines and traces of thoroughfares and 
so on. But here, where all of the big 
cities and three-fourths or more of 
the medium-sized ones had been, 
there were now only huge sheets of 
glass. 

Sheets of glass ranging in area 
from ten or fifteen square miles up 
to several thousands of square miles, 
and variously from dozens up to 
hundreds of feet thick: level sheets 
of cracked and shattered, almost 
transparent, vari-colored glass. The 
people of the remaining cities and 
towns and villages were human. In 
fact, they were white Caucasians — 
as white and as Caucasian as the 
citizens of Tampa or of Chicago 
or of Portland, Oregon or of Port- 
land, Maine. Neither Seaton nor 
Shiro, search as they would, could 
find any evidence that any Oriental 
types then lived or ever had lived 
on that world — to Shiro’s lasting re- 
gret. He, at least, was eliminated as 
a spy. 

‘‘Well, Dottie?” Seaton asked. 



She gnawed her lip. “Well ... I 
suppose we’ll have to do something 
— but hey!” she exclaimed, voice and 
expression changing markedly. “How 
come you think you have to go down 
there at all to find out what the 
score is? You’ve snatched people 
right and left all over the place with 
ordinary beams and things, long be- 
fore anybody ever heard of that 
sixth-order, fourth-dimensional giz- 
mo. 

Seaton actually blushed. “That’s 
right, my pet,” he admitted. “Once 
again you’ve got a point. I’ll pick 
one out that’s so far away from 
everybody else that he won’t be 
missed for a while. Maybe two’d be 
better.” 

Since it was an easy matter to 
find isolated specimens of the hu- 
manity of that world, it was less 
than an hour later that two men — 
one from a town, one found wan- 
dering alone in the mountains — 
were being examined by the Brain. 
And what an examination! Every- 
thing in their minds — ^literally every- 
thing, down to the last-least-tiniest 
coded “bit” of every long-chain pro- 
teinoid molecule of every convolu- 
tion of their brains — everything was 
being transferred to the Valeron^s 
Great Brain; was being filed away 
in its practically unfill able memory 
banks. 

When the transfer was complete, 
Sitar drew her pistol, very evidently 
intending to do away with the na- 
tives then and there. But Dorothy of 
course would not stand for that. In- 
stead, she herself put them back into 
a shell of force and ran them through 
the Valeron*s locks and down into 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



99 




m mountain cave^ which she then 
half-filled with food. “I’d advise you 
tv. o,” she told them then, in their 
own language, “to stay put here for 
a few days and keep out of trouble. 
If you really want to gel yourselves 
killed, though, that’s all right with 
me. Go ahead any time.*’ 

When Dorothy brought her at- 
tention back into the control room, 
tibe Brain had finished its analysis 
of the data it had just secured from 
the natives, had correlated it with 
all their pertinent data it had in its 
banks, and was beginning to put out 
its synthesized report. 

T hat report came in thought; in 
diamond-sharp, diamond-clear 
thought that was not only super-in- 
telligible and super-audible, but al- 
so was more starkly visible than any 
possible tri-di. It gave, as no possible 
other form of report could give, the 
entire history of the race to which 
those two men belonged. It described 
in detail and at length the Chlorans 
amd the relationship between the two 
races, and went on to give, in equal 
detail, the most probable course of 
near-term events. It told Seaton that 
he should investigate this planet 
Ray-See-Nee in person. It told him 
in fine detail what to wear, where to 
go, and. practically every move to 
make for the ensuing twenty-four 
hours. 

At that point the report stopped, 
and when ^aton demanded more in- 
formation, the Brain balked. “Data 
insufficient,” it thought, and every- 
one there would have sworn that the 
Great Brain actually had a con- 
sciousness of self as it went on, “This 



construct — ” it actually meant “1” 
— “is not built to guess, but deals 
only in virtual certainties; that is, 
with probabilities that approximate 
unity to twelve or more nines. With 
additional data, this matter can be 
explored to a depth quite strictly 
proportional to the sufficiency of 
the data. That is all.” 

“That’s the package, Dottie,” 
Seaton said then. “If we want to 
reach the Chlorans .without them 
reaching us first, there’s how. That 
makes it a force, wouldn’t you say?” 
Dorothy wasn’t sure. “For twen- 
ty-four hours, I guess,” she agreed, 
dubiously. “After which time I think 
I’ll be screaming for you to come 
back here and feed that monster 
some more data. So be mighty dam 
sure to get some.” 

“I’ll try to, that’s for sure. But 
the really smart thing to do might 
be to take this wreckage half a dozen 
galaxies away and put the Brain to 
work rebuilding her while I’m down 
there investigating.” 

“D’you think I’ll sit still for thatV* 
Dorothy blazed. “If you do, you’re 
completely out of your mind!” 

And even Crane did not subscribe 
to the idea. “Why?” he asked, “Just 
to tear her down again after you’ve 
found out what we’ll have to have?” 
“That’s so, too.” Seaton thought 
for a moment, gray eyes narrowed 
and focused on infinity, translating 
the imperatives of the Brain into 
practical measures. Then he nodded. 
“All right. I admit I’ll feel better 
about the deal with you people and 
the Brain standing by.” 

And Seaton, now lean and hard 
and deeply tanned, sat down in his

master controller and began to man- 
ufacture the various items he would 
need; exactly as the Brain told him 
to make them. 

And next morning, as the sun be- 
gan to peer over the crest of the 
high mountain ridge directly below 
the Skylark of Valeron, Seaton came 
to ground, hid his tiny landing-craft 
in a cave at the eighteen-thousand- 
foot level, and hiked the fifteen miles 
down-mountain to the nearest town. 

H e now looked very little indeed 
like the Doctor Richard B. 
Seaton of the Rare Metals Labor- 
atory. He was almost gaunt. His skin 
was burned to a shade consistent 
with years of exposure to wind and 
weather. His hair had very evident- 
ly been cut — occasionally — with 
shears by his own hand; his beard 
had been mowed — equally occasion- 
ally — with those same shears. 

He wore crudely made, heavy, 
hobnailed, high-laced boots; a pair 
of baggy, unsymmetrical breeches of 
untanned deerskin; and a shapeless, 
poor-grade-leather coat that had 
been patched crudely and repeat- 
edly at elbows and shoulders and 
across the back. He also wore what 
was left of a hard hat. 

As he strode into the town and 
along its main street, more than 
one pair of eyes looked at him and 
then looked again, for the people 
of that town were not used to seeing 
anyone walk purposefully. Nor was 
the sloppily uniformed guard at the 
entrance to City Hall. This wight — 
who couldn’t have been a day over 
fifteen — opened his eyes, almost 
straightened up and said: 



“Halt, you. Who’a you? Whatcha 
want?” 

“Business,” Seaton said, briskly. 
“To see the mayor, Ree-Toe Prenk.” 

“Awri’; g’wan in,” and the youth 
relapsed into semi-stuporous lean- 
ing on his ratty-looking rusty rifle. 

It was easy enough to find His 
Honor’s office, since it was the only 
one in the building doing any busi- 
ness at all. Seaton paused just inside 
the doorway and looked around. Ev- 
erything was shabby and neglected. 
The wall-to-wall carpet was stained 
and dirty, worn through to the floor, 
in several places. The divider-rail 
leaned drunkenly, forward here, 
backward there. The vacant recep- 
tionist’s desk was as battered and 
scarred as though it had been 
through a war. The place hadn’t 
been cleaned for months, and not 
very thoroughly then. 

And the people in that office were 
in perfect sync with their surround- 
ings. Half a dozen melancholy-look- 
ing people, men and women, sat 
listlessly on hard, straight-backed 
chairs; staring glumly, fixedly at 
nothing; completely disinterested, 
apparently, in whether they were 
ever called into the inner office or 
not. 

And the secretary! She was dressed 
in what looked like a gunny-sack. 
She was scrawny. Her unkempt, 
straight, lank hair was dirty-mouse 
brown in color. She didn’t look very 
bright. She was, however, the only 
secretary in sight, so Seaton strode 
up to her desk. 

“Miss What’s-your-name!” he 
snapped. “Can you, without rup- 
turing a blood-vessel, come to life 



102 



IF 




long enough to do half a minute’s 
work?” 

The girl jumped, started to rise 
to her feet at her desk, and blushed. 
“Why, yes . yes, sir, I mean. 
What can we do for you. Mister — ?” 
“I’m Ky-El Mokak. I want to talk 
to Hizzonner about turning myself 
in.” 

T hat brought her to life fast. 

“About whatT she cried, and 
her half-scream was followed instant- 
ly by a deeper, louder voice from 
the intercom. 

His honor had not been asleep 
after all. “You what? All right, Fy- 
Ly, send him in; but be sure he 
hasn’t got a gun first.” 

“Gun? What would I be doing 
with a gun?” Seaton patted his 
pockets, shucked off his dilapidated 
coat, and made a full turn to show 
that he was clean. Then, seeing no 
coat-rack or hangers, he pitched the 
coat and hat into a corner and 
strode into the inner office. 

It was, if possible, in even worse 
shape than the outer one. The man 
behind the desk was fifty-odd years 
old; lean and bald. He looked wor- 
ried, dyspeptic and nervous. He held 
a hand-weapon — which was not the 
least bit rusty — in workmanlike 
faaihion in a competent-looking right 
hand. It was not pointed directly at 
Seaton’s midsection. It evidently 
did not have to be, 

“What I’d ought to do right now,” 
the man said quietly, “is blow your 
brains out without letting you say a 
word. You’re another damn rat. A 
fink — a spy — maybe a rewer or an 
undergrounder, even. You don’t look 



like any wilder I ever saw brought 
in.” 

The Brain had not dumped Seaton 
on a strange and dangerous new 
planet without providing him with a 
full “knowledge” of its history, its 
mores and even its dialects. Through 
the educators Seaton had received 
enough of Ray-See-Nee’s cultural 
patterns to be able to carry off his 
role. He knew what His Honor was 
thinking about; he knew, even, very 
accurately just how far the man 
could be pushed, where his real 
sympathies lay, and what he could 
be counted upon to do about it. 

Wherefore Seaton said easily: “Of 
course I don’t. I’ve got a brain. 
Those lard-headed chasseurs couldn’t 
catch me in a thousand years. None 
of ’em can detect a smell on a skunk. 
And you won’t shoot me, not with 
the bind you’re in. You aren’t a 
damn enough fool to. You wouldn’t 
shoot a crippled kid on crutches, let 
alone a full-grown, able-bodied 
man.” 

Prenk shivered a little, but that 
was all. “Who says I’m in a bind? 
What kind of a bind?” 

“I say so,” Seaton said, flatly. 
“You’re hitting bottom right now. 
You’re using half-grown kids: girls, 
even. How many weeks is it going 
to be before you don’t make quota 
and your town and everything and 
everybody in it get turned into a 
lake of lava?” 

Prenk trembled visibly and his 
face turned white. “You win,” he 
said unsteadily, and put his pistol 
back into the top right-hand drawer 
of his desk. “Whoever you are, you 
know the score and aren’t afraid to 



8KYURK DuQUESNE 



103 




talk about it. You’d have no papers, 
of course — on yoii, at least . Let’s 
see your arm.” 

“No number.” Seaton rolled up 
his left sleeve and held his forearm 
out for examination. “Look close. 
Scars left by good surgery are fine, 
i Lit they can’t be made invisible.” 
“I know they can’t.” His Honor 
looked very closely indeed, then drew 
a tremendously deep breath of re- 
lief. “You are a wilder! You mean 
to say you’ve been up in the hills 
ever since the Conquest without get- 
ting caught?” 

“That’s right, i told you I’m 
smart, and the brains of a whole 
platoon of chasseurs, all concentrat- 
ed down into one, wouldn’t equip 
a half-witted duck.” 

“But they’ve got dogs^ 

“Yeah, but they aren’t smart, 
either. Not very much smarter than 
the chasseurs are. Hell, I’ve been liv- 
ing on those dogs half the time. 
Pretty tough, fried or roasted, but 
boiled long enough they make mighty 
tasty stew.” 

“Mi-Ko-Ta’s beard! Who are you, 
really, and what were you,, before?” 
“I told you, I’m Ky-El-Mokak. I 
am — was, rather — a Class ‘Twelve 
Fellow of the Institute of Mining 
Engineers. Recognize the ring?” 
Seaton went to the desk and placed 
his left hand flat on its surface. 

P renk studied the massive orna- 
ment. It had been fabricated, 
in strict external accord with the 
Brain’s visualization of what it should 
have been, from synthesized meteo- 
ric metal — metal that had actually 
never been in open space, to say 



nothing of ever having been any- 
where near the gray-lichened walls 
of the revered Institute that Seaton 
had never seen. 

Having examined the ring min- 
utely, Prenk looked up and nodded; 
his whole manner changed. “I recog- 
nize the ring and I can read the 
symbols. A Twelve! It’s a shame to 
register and brand you. If you say so 
I’ll let it drop.” 

“I’ll say so. I’m not committing 
myself that deep yet.” 

“All right, but why did you come 
in? Or is it true that whatever un- 
dergrounds spring up are smashed 
flat in a week?” 

“I don’t know. I couldn’t find 
any. Not one, and I searched every 
square mile for a thousand miles 
north, east, south, and west of here. 
And I didn’t find anybody who 
wasn’t too dangerous to travel with, 
and I’m gregarious. Also, I don’t 
like caves and I don’t like camp 
cooking and I don’t like living off 
the land — and I do like music and 
books and art and educated people 
and so on — in other words, I 
found out that I can’t revert to 
savagery. And, not least, I like 
women and there aren’t any out 
there. What few ever make it up 
there die fast.” 

“I’m beginning to believe you.” 
A little of the worry and harass- 
ment left His Honor’s face. “One 
more question. Why, knowing the 
jam we’re in, did you come here in- 
stead of going somewhere where 
you’d be safe?” 

“Because, on the basis of stuff I 
picked up here and there, you and I 
together can make it safe here. I

IF 




can fix your mining machinery easi- 
ly enough so you can make quota 
every week with no sweat; so the 
town won’t get flagged down; not 
right away, anyway. You aren’t a 
quisling, and my best guess is that 
most of the spies and storm-troop- 
ers have sneaked out or have been 
pulled out because of what’s sup- 
posed to be about to happen here,” 
Seaton said. 

Prenk stared thoughtfully at Sea- 
ton. “You don’t appear to be the 
suicidal type. But you know as well 
as I do that just making quota won’t 
be enough for very long. What have 
you really got in mind, Ky-El- 
Mokak?” 

Seaton thought for a moment. 
Then, shrugging his shoulders, he 
dug down into his baggy breeches 
and brought out two closely folded 
headsets. 

“Put one of these on. It isn’t 
a player or a recorder; just a kind 
of super-telephone. A fast way of 
exchanging information.” 

Prenk wore it for a couple of 
minutes, then took it off, staring sus- 
piciously in turn at it and at Sea- 
ton. “Why didn’t I ever hear of any- 
thing like that before?” he demanded. 
Seaton didn’t answer the question 
and Prenk went on, “Oh; secret. 
Okay. But what makes you think 
you can set up an underground right 
out here in the open?” 

“There’s no reason in the world 
why we can’t,” Seaton declared. 
“Especially since we’d just be re- 
vmng one that everybody, including 
the Premier and you yourself, thinks 
is smashed flat and is about to be 
liquidated.” 



T his was the second really severe - 
test Seaton had made of the 
Brain’s visualizations, and it too 
stood solidly up. All Prenk said 
was, “You’re doing the talking; 
keep it up,” but his hands, clench- 
ing tightly into fists, showed that 
Seaton’s shot had struck the mark. 

“I’ve talked enough,” Seaton said 
then. “From here on I’d be just 
guessing. It’s your turn to talk.” 

“All right. It’s too late now. I’m 
afraid, for anything to make any 
difference. Yes, I was the leader of 
a faction that believed in decent, 
humane, civilized government, but 
we weren’t here then, we were in the 
capital. Our coup failed. And those 
of us who were caught were exiled 
here and arrangements were made 
for us to be the next wipe-out.” 
“Some of your party survived, 
then. Could you interest them again, 
do you think?” 

“Without arms and equipment, 
no. That was why we failed.” 
“Equipment would be no prob- 
lem.” 

“It wouldn’t?” Prenk’s eyes began 
to light up. 

“No.” Seaton did not elaborate, 
but went on, “The problem is peo- 
ple and morale. I can’t supply peo- 
ple and we have to start here, not 
over in the capital. Self-preservation. 
We’ve got to make quota. Your 
people have been hammered down 
so flat that they don’t give a whoop 
whether they live or die. As I said, 

I can fix the machinery, but that 
of itself won’t be enough. We’ll have 
to give ’em a shot in the arm of 
hope.” 

“Okay, and thanks.” 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



105 




no one in the outer office, 
not even the secretary, so much as 
looked up as the two men, talking 
busily, walked out. 

D uQuesne, en route to Earth, 
knew just what a madhouse 
Earth was, and in just what respects. 
He knew just how nearly impossi- 
ble it was to buy machine tools 
of any kind. He also knew just 
what an immense job it was going 
to be to build a duplicate of the 
Skylark of Valeron. Or, rather, to 
build the tools that would build the 
machines that would in turn build 
the planetoid. With his high-order 
constructors he could build most of 
those primary machine tools him- 
self; perhaps all of them in time; 
but time was exactly what he did 
not have. Time was decidedly of the 
essence. 

DuQuesne’s ex-employer. The 
World Steel Corporation, had bil- 
lions of dollars’ worth of exactly 
the kind of tooling he had to have. 
They not only used it, they manu- 
factured it and sold it. And what 
of it they did not manufacture they 
could buy. 

How they could buy! As a result 
of many years of intensive, highly 
organized, and well directed snoop- 
ing, Brookings of Steel had over a 
thousand very effective handles 
upon over' a thousand very import- 
ant men. 

And he, DuQuesne, had a per- 
fect handle on Brookings. He was 
much harder and ruthless than 
Brookings was, and Brookings knew 
it. He could make Brookings buy 
his primary tooling for him — 



enough of it to stuff the Capital D 
to her outer skin. And he would do 
just that. 

Wherefore, as soon as he got with- 
in working range of Earth, he 
launched his projection directly in- 
to Brookings’ private office. This 
time, the tycoon was neither calm 
nor quiet. Standing behind his desk, 
chair lying on its side behind him, 
he was leaning forward with his 
left hand flat on the top of his desk. 
He was clutching a half-smoked, 
half-chewed cigar in his right hand 
and brandishing it furiously in the 
air. He was yelling at his terrified 
secretary; who, partly standing in 
front of her chair and partly 
crouching into it, was trying to mus- 
ter up courage to run. 

Tl^hen DuQuesne’s projection ap- 
peared Brookings fell silent 
for a moment and goggled. Then 
he screamed. “Get out of here, you!” 
at the girl, who scuttled frantically 
away. He hurled what was left of 
his cigar into his big bronze ash- 
tray, where it disintegrated into a 
shower of sparks and a slathery mess 
of soggy, sticky brown leaves. And 
finally, exerting everything he had 
of self-control, he picked his chair 
up, sat down in it and glared at 
DuQuesne. 

“Careful of your apoplexy. Fat,” 
DuQuesne sneered then. “I’ve told 
you — you’ll rupture your aorta 
some day and that will just about 
break my heart.” 

Brookings’ reply to that was un- 
printable; after which he went on, 
even more bitterly, “This is all it 
lacks to make this a perfect day.” 



106 



IF 




“Yeah,” DuQuesne agreed, cal- 
lously. “Some days you can’t lay 
up a cent. I suppose you’ve been 
eager to know why I didn’t return 
your goons to you.” 

“There’s nothing in the world I’m 
less interested in.” 

“ni tell you anyway, for the rec- 
ord.” DuQuesne did not know what 
had actually happened, but Brook- 
ings was never to know that. “They 
each got one free shot, as I said they 
would. But they missed.” 

“Skip that. Doctor,” Brookings 
said, brusquely. “You didn’t come 
here for that. What do you want 
this time?” 

DuQuesne reached over, took a 
ball-point out of Brookings’ pocket, 
tore the top sheet off of the memo- 
randum pad on Brookings’ desk, and 
wrote out an order for one hundred 
twenty-five million dollars, payable 
to the World Steel Corporation, on 
a numbered account in a Swiss bank. 
He slid the order across the glass 
top of the desk and said: 

“You needn’t worry about wheth- 
er it’s good or not. It is. I want ma- 
chine tools and fast deliverys.” 
Brookings glanced at the paper, 
but did not touch it. His every 
muscle tensed, but he did not quite 
blow itp again. “Machine tools,” 
he grated. “You know damn well 
money’s no good on them.” 

“Money alone, no.” DuQuesne 
agreed equably. “That’s why I’m 
having you apply pressure. You’ll 
get the details — orders, specs, 
times and places of delivery, and 
so forth — by registered mail to- 
morrow morning. Shall I spell out 
the ‘or else’ for you?” 



Brookings was quivering with 
rage, but there wasn’t a thing is 
the world he could do about the 
situation and he knew it. “Not for 
me,” he managed finally, “but I’d 
better record it for certain people 
who will have to know.” 

“Okay. Any mistake in any detail 
of the transaction or one second 
more than twenty-four hours’ delay 
in any specified time of delivery will 
mean a one-hundred-kiloton super- 
atomic on North Africa Number 
Eleven. Good-by.” 

And DuQuesne cut his projec- 
tion. To Brookings, he seemed to 
vanish; to DuQuesne himself, he 
simply was back in his own Capital 
D, far out in space; and DuQuesne 
allowed himself to smile. 

Things were going rather well, 
he thought. Seaton was tangled up 
with whoever the new enemy had 
turned out to be; might well be 
dead; at any rate, was not a factor he, 
DuQuesne, needed currently to take 
into his calculations. By the time 
Seaton was back in circulation Du- 
Quesne should have his new ship 
and be ready to handle him. And 
from then on . 

From then on, thought DuQuesne, 
it was only a short step to his right- 
ful, inevitable destiny: His universe. 
No one able to contest his mastery. 
— So thought DuQuesne, who at 
that point in time knew nearly every 
factor that bore upon his plans, 
and had carefully and correctly 
evaluated them all. He knew about 
the Llurdi and the Jelmi; he knew 
that Seaton and the Chlorans were, 
from his point of view, keeping 
each other neutralized; he knew that 

lor 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 




the Norlaminians, even» were un- 
likely to cause him any trouble. Du- 
Quesne really knew all the relevant 
facts but one — or, you might say, 
two. These two facts were a very 
long distance away. One was a young 
girl. The ether was her mother. 

Two individuals out of a universe! 
Why, even if DuQuesne had known 
of their existence, he might have 
discounted their importance com- 
pletely. In which he would have 
been — completely — wrong. 

XVI 

Humanity Triumphant, Not Inc 

S ince Seaton as Ky-El Mokak was 
not the least bit fussy, he ac- 
cepted the first house that Prenk 
showed him. His honor offered al- 
so — with a more than somewhat 
suggestive expression — to send 
him a housekeeper, but Seaton de- 
clined the offer with thanks; ex- 
plaining that that could wait until 
he got himself organized and could 
do a little looking around for him- 
self. 

Prenk gave Seaton a handful of 
currency and a ground-car — one 
of Prenk’s own, this; a beautifully 
streamlined, beautifully kept little 
three-wheeled jewel of a ground- 
car — told him where the shopping- 
centers were, and went back to City 
Hall; 

Seaton bought a haircut and a 
shave, a couple of outfits of cloth- 
ing, and some household supplies, 
which he took out to his new home 
and stowed away. 

By that time it was the local 



equivalent of half-past three, and the 
shifts changed at four o’clock; 
wherefore he drove his spectacular 
little speedster six miles up-canyon 
to the uraninite mine that was the 
sole reason for the town’s existence. 
Since he did not want to be shot 
out of hand, he did not dare to be 
late or to do anything unusual, ei- 
ther during the five-mile train-ride 
along the main tunnel or during the 
skip-ride down to the eighty-four- 
hundred-foot level where he was 
to work. 

Once in the stope itself, however, 
he stopped — exactly thirteen feet 
short of the stiffly erect young over- 
seer — and stood still while his 
shiftmates picked up their tools and 
started for the hanging wall — the 
something-more-than-vertical face 
of the cavernous stope — to begin 
their day’s work. 

The overseer was a well-fed young 
man, and the second native Seaton 
had seen who looked more than 
half alive. His jacket, breeches and 
boots were as glossily black as his 
crash-helmet was glossily white. He 
'vas a very proud young man, and 
arrogant. His side-arm hung proud- 
ly at his hip. His bull-whip coiled 
arrogantly ready for instant use. 

This wight stared haughtily at Sea- 
ton for a moment, and began to swell 
up like a pouter pigeon. Then, as 
Seaton made an unmistakeable ges- 
ture at him, he went into smoothly 
violent action. 

“Oh, you’re the wilder!” he snarl- 
ed, and swung the heavy blacksnake 
with practised ease. 

But Seaton had known exactly 
what to expect and he was ready for 



108 



IF 




it He ducked and sidestepped with 
the speed and control of the trained 
gymnast that he was; he handled 
ibe short, thick club that had been 
m his sleeve as though it were the 
wand of the highly skilled prestigita- 
tor that he was. Thus, in the instant 
that the end of the lash curled sav- 
agely around the hickory he swung 
it like a home-run hitter swings a 
bat — and caught the blacksnake’s 
heavy, shot-loaded butt on the fly 
in his right hand. 

The minion went for his gun, of 
course, but Seaton’s right arm was 
already swinging around and back, 
and as gun cleared holster the bull- 
whip’s vicious tip snapped around 
both gun and hand with a pistol- 
sharp report. The trooper stared, 
for an instant stunned, at the blood 
spurting from his paralyzed right 
hand; and that instant was enough. 
Seaton stepped up to him and put 
his left fist deep into his midsection. 
Then, as the half-conscious man be- 
gan to double over, he sent his right 
fist against its preselected target. Not 
the jaw — he didn’t want to break 
his hand — the throat. Nor did he 
hit him hard; he didn’t want to kill 
tihie guy, or even damage him per- 
manently., 

A s the man fell to the hard-rock 
floor — writhing in agony, 
groaning, strangling and gasping hor- 
ribly for breath — the men and 
women and teen-agers looking on 
burst as one into clamor. “Stomp 
‘im!” they shrieked and yelled. 
“Give ’im the boots! Stomp’im! Kill 
^im! Stomp ‘is head clean off! Stbmp 
*im right down into the rock!’’ 




109 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



“Hold it!” Seaton rasped, and 
the miners fell silent; but they did 
not relapse into their former apathy. 

Seaton stood by, waiting coldly 
for his victim to be able to draw a 
breath. He picked the overseer’s pis- 
tol-like weapon up and looked it 
over. He had never seen anything 
like it before, and casual inspection 
didn’t tell him much about how it 
worked, but that could wait. He 
didn’t intend to use it. In fact, he 
wasn’t really interested in it at all. 

When the overseer had partially 
recovered his senses, Seaton jammed 
a headset onto his head and thought 
viciously at him; as much to give him 
a taste of real punishment as to find 
out what he knew and to impress 
upon his mind exactly what he had 
to do if he hoped to keep on living. 
Then Seaton made what was for him 
a speech. First, to the now complete- 
ly deflated officer: 

“You — you slimy traitor, you 
stinking turncoat, you quisling! 
Know now that a new regime has 
taken over. Maybe I’ll let you live 
and maybe I’ll turn you over to 
these boys and girls here — you 
know what they’d do to you. That 
depends on how exactly you stick to 
what I just told you. One thought 
of a squeal — if you ever get one 
milli-meter out of line, and you’ll 
be under surveillance every second of 
every day — you’ll die a long, slow, 
tough death. And I mean tough!” 

He turned to the miners; studied 
them narrowly. His “shot in the 
arm” had done them a lot of good. 
Excitement was still high; none of 
them had relapsed into the apathy 
that had affected them all such a 



short time before. In fact, one close- 
clustered group of men was eyeing 
Seaton and the overseer in a fashion 
that made it perfectly clear that, 

had it not been for Seaton’s mien 
and the gun and the whip, there 

would have been a lynching then and 
there. 

“Take it easy, people,” Seaton 
told them. “I know you all want to 

tear this ape apart, but what good 

would it do? None. Not a bit. So 
I won’t let you do it, if I have to 
use the whip and even the gun to 
keep you from it. But I don't intend 
to use either whip or gun and I 
don’t think I’ll have to, because this 
is the first bite of a fresh kettle of 
fish for every civilized human being 
of this world. I won’t go into much 
detail, but I represent a group of 
human beings, as human as your- 
selves, called HUMANITY TRIUM- 
PHANT. I’m a fore-runner. I’m here 
to bring you a message; to tell you 
that humanity has never been con- 
quered permanently and never will 
be so conquered. Humanity has tri- 
umphed and will continue to triumph 
over all the vermin infesting all the 
planets of alj the solar systems of 
all the galaxies of all surveyed space. 

“HUMANITY TRIUMPHANT’S 
plans have been made in full and are 
being put out into effect. Humanity 
will win here, and in not too long 
a time. Every Chloran in every solar 
system in this region of space will 
die. That’s a promise. 

“Nor do we need your help. All 
we ask you is that you produce the 
full quota of ore every week, so 
that no Chloran warship will come 
here too soon. And that production 



110 



IF 




•win be no problem very shortly, 
since I can repair your machinery 
and will have it all back in working 
order by one week from today. So in 
a very few weeks you women can 
go back to keeping house for your 
families; you youngsters can go back 
to school; and half of you men will 
be able to make quota in half a shift 
and spend the other half of it playing 
penny-ante. And you, Brother Rat 
— ” he turned back to the deposed 
overseer — “you can peel that pretty 
uniform. You’re going to work, right 
now. You and I are going to be part- 
ners — and if you so much as begin 
to drag your feet I’ll slap your face 
clear around onto the back of your 
neck. Let’s go!” 

T hey went. They picked up a 
drill — which weighed all of 
three hundred pounds — and lugged 
it across the rough rock floor to the 
foot of the face; which, translated 
from the vernacular, means the 
lower edge of the expanse of high- 
grade ore that was being worked. 

It was a beautiful thing, that face; 
a startlingly high and wide expanse 
of the glossly, lustrous, submetallic 
pitch black of uraninite; slashed and 
spattered and shot through at ran- 
dom with' the characteristic violent 
yellows of autunite and carnotite and 
the variant greens of torbernite. 

But Seaton was not particularly 
interested in beauty at the moment. 
What he hoped was that he could 
keep from giving away the fact that 
this was the first time he had ever 
handled a mining machine of any 
kind or type. He thought he could, 
however, and he did. 



For, after all, there are nr.ly so 
many ways in which holes can be 
made in solid rock. Second, since 
the hard-rock men who operate the 
machinery to make those holes are 
never the greatest intellects of any 
world, such machinery must be es- 
sentially simple. And third, the 
Brain’s visualizations had been very 
complete and Richard Seaton was, 
as he had admitted to Prenk, an ex- 
ceptionally smart man. 

Wherefore, although Seaton unob- 
trusively let the ex-overseer take the 
lead, the two men worked very well 
together and the native did not once 
drag his feet. They set up the heavy 
drill and locked it in place against 
the face. They slipped the shortest 
“twelve-inch” steel into the chuck 
and rammed it home. They turned 
on the air and put their shoulders to 
the stabilizing pads — and that mon- 
strous machine, bellowing and thun- 
dering under the terrific urge of two 
hundred pounds to the square inch 
of compressed air, drove that heavy 
bit resistlessly into the ore. 

And the rest of the miners, fired 
by Seaton’s example as well as by 
his “shot in the arm”, worked as 
they had not worked in months; to 
such good purpose that when the 
shift ended at midnight the crew had 
sent out almost twice as much high- 
grade ore as they had delivered the 
night before. 

I t need hardly be mentioned, per- 
haps, that Seaton was enjoying 
himself very much. Although he was 
not, in truth, the “big, muscle-bound 
ape — especially between the ears” 
he was wont to describe himself as, 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



111 




there was certainly a pleasure in be- 
ing up against the sort of problem 
that muscle and skill could settle. 
For a time he was concerned about 
the fact that events elsewhere might 
be proceeding at a pace he could 
not control; but there was not a min- 
ute spent on the surface of this 
planet that was not a net gain in 
terms of the automatic repair of the 
Valeron, That great ship had been 
hurt. Since there was at the moment 
very little that Seaton could do ef- 
fectively about DuQuesne, or direct- 
ly about the Chlorans, or the Fena- 
chrone — and was a great deal he 
could do here on the surface of 
Ray-See-Nee — he put the other mat- 
ters out of his mind and did what 
had to be done. 

And enjoyed it enormously! 

Seaton went “home” to the empty 
and solitary house that was his tem- 
porary residence and raised the over- 
size ring to his lips. “Dottie,” he 
said. 

“Oh, Dick!” a tiny scream came 
from the ring. “I wish you wouldn’t 
take such horrible chances! I thought 
I’d diel Won’t you, tomorrow morn- 
ing, just shoot the louse, out of hand? 
PleaseT 

“I wasn’t taking any chances. Dot; 
a man with half my training could 
have done it. I had to do something 
spectacular to snap these people out 
of it; they’re dead from the belt- 
buckle up, down, and back. But I’ve 
done enough, I think, so I won’t 
have any more trouble at all. It’ll get 
around — and howl — and strictly on 
the Q and T. All those other apes 
will need is a mere touch of fist.” 

“You hope. Me, too, for that mat- 



ter. Just a sec, here’s Martin. He 
wants to talk to you about that ma- 
chinery business,” and Crane’s voice 
replaced Dorothy’s. 

“I certainly do, Dick. You say you 
want two-hundred-fifty-pound Sul- 
livan Sluggers, complete with var- 
iable-height mounts and inch-and- 
a-quarter — that’s English, remember 
— bits. You want Ingersoll-Rand 
compressors and Westinghouse gen- 
erators and Wilfley tables and so on, 
each item by name and no item re- 
sembling any of their own ma- 
chinery in any particular. Since you 
are supposed to be repairing their 
own machinery, wouldn’t it be bet- 
ter to have the Brain do just that, 
while you look on, make wise mo- 
tions, and learn?” 

“It might be better, at that,” Sea- 
ton admitted, after a moment’s 
thought. “My thought was that since 
nobody now working in the mine 
knows anything much about either 
mining or machinery it wouldn’t 
make any difference, as long as the 
stuff was good and rusty on the out- 
side, and I know how our stuff 
works. But I can learn theirs and 
it will save a lot of handling and 
we’ll have the time. They’re work- 
ing only two shifts in only one stope, 
you know. Lack of people. But nine- 
tenths of their equipment is as dead 
as King Tut and the rest of it starts 
falling apart every time anybody 
gives any of it a stern look — I was 
scared spitless all shift that we’d be 
running out of air or power, or both, 
any minute. So we’ll have to do one 
generator and at least one compres- 
sor tonight; so you might as well 
start getting the stuff ready for me.”

IF 




“It’s ready. HI send it down as 
soon as it gets good and dark. In 
the meantime, how about Brother 
Rat? Have you anyone watching 
him?” 

“No, I didn’t think it was neces- 
sary. But it might be, at that. From 
up there, would you say?” 

“Definitely. And Shiro and Lotus 
haven’t much to do at the moment, 
ni make arrangements.” 

“Do that, guy, and so long ’till 
dark.” 

“Just a sec, Dick,” Dorothy said 
then. “I’m not done with you yet. 
You remembered the no-neighbors 
bit, I think?” 

“I sure did, Honey-Chile. No 
neighbors within half a mile. So, 
any dark of the moon, slip down here 
in one of the fifteen-footers and all 
will be well.” 

“You big, nice man,” Dorothy 
purred. “Comes dark, comes me! 
an’ you can lay to that.” 

C ountless parsecs away, DuQuesne 
made proper entry into the 
Solar System, put his Capital D into 
a parking orbit around Earth, and 
began to pick up his tremendous or- 
der of machine tools and supplies. It 
went well; Brookings had done his 
job. There was, however, one job 
DuQuesne had to do for himself. 
During the loading, accordingly, he 
went in person to Washington, D.C., 
to the Rare Metals Laboratory, and 
to Room 1631. 

That room’s door was open. He 
•tapped lightly on it as he entered 
the room. He closed the door gently 
behind him. 

“Park it,” a well-remembered con- 



tralto voice said. **Bc with you in a 
moment.” 

“No rush.” DuQuesne sat down, 
crossed his legs, lighted a cigarette, 
and gazed at the woman seated at 
her electronics panel. Both her eyes 
were buried in the light-shield of a 
binocular eyepiece; both her hands 
were manipulating vernier knobs in 
tiny arcs. 

“Oh! Hi, Blackie! Be with you in 
half a moment.” 

“No sweat, Hunkie. Finish your 
obs.” 

“Natch.” Her attention had not 
wavered for an instant from her in- 
struments; it did not waver then. 

In a minute or so she pressed a 
button, her panel went dark, and 
she rose to her feet. “It’s been a long 
time, Blackie,” she said, stepping 
toward him and extending her hand. 

“It has indeed.” He took her hand 
and began an encircling action with 
his left — a maneuver which she 
countered, neatly but still smilingly, 
by grasping his left hand and holding 
it firmly. 

Tsk, tsk,” she tsked. “The mer- 
chandise is on display, Blackie, but it 
is not to be handled. Remember?” 

“I remember. Still untouchable,” 
he said. 

“That’s right. You’re a hard-nosed, 
possessive brute, Blackie — any man 
to interest me very much would have 
to be, I suppose — but no man bom 
is ever going to tell me what I can 
or can’t do. Selah. But let’s skip 
that.” She released his hands, waved 
him to a chair, sat down, crossed her 
legs, accepted the lighted cigarette 
he handed her, and went on, 
“Thanks. The gossip was that you

were all washed up and had, as 
Ferdy put it, ‘taken it on the lam.’ 
I didn’t believe it then and I don’t 
believe it now, I've been wanting to 
tell you; you’re a good enough man 
so that whatever you’re really after, 
you’ll get.” 

This woman could reach Du- 
Quesne as no other woman ever had. 
“Thanks, Hunkie,” he said; and, 
reaching out, he pressed her right 
hand hard then dropped it. “What 1 
came up here for — have you a date 
for Thursday evening that you can’t 
or won’t break?” 

Her smile widened; her two lovely 
dimples deepened. “Don’t tell me; 
let me guess. Louisa Vinciughi in 
Lucia:' 

“Nothing else but. You .like?” 

“I love. With the usual stipula- 
tion — we ‘Dutch’ it.” 

“Listen, Hunkie!” he protested. 
“Aren’t you ever going to get off of 
that ‘Dutch’ thing? Don’t you think 
a man can take a girl out without 
having monkey-business primarily in 
mind?” 

S he considered the question 
thoughtfully, then nodded. “As 
stated, yes. Eliding the one word 
‘primarily’, no. I’ve heard you called 
a lot of things, my friend, but ‘stupid’ 
was never one of them. Not even 
once.” 

“I know.” DuQuesne smiled, a 
trifle wryly. “You are not going to 
be obligated by any jot or iota or 
tittle to any man living or yet to be 
born.” 

Her head went up a little and her 
smile became a little less warm. 
“That’s precisely right, Marc. But 



I’ve never made any secret of the 
fact that I enjoy your company a 
lot. So, on that basis, okay and 
thanks.” 

“On that basis, then, if that’s the 
way it has to be, and thanks to you, 
too,” DuQuesne said, and look his 
leave. 

And Thursday evening came; and 
all during that long and thoroughly 
pleasant evening the man was, to the 
girl’s highly sensitive perception . 
well, different, although very subtly 
so. He was not quite, by some very 
small fraction, his usual completely 
poised and urbane self. Even Vin- 
ciughi’s wonderful soprano voice did 
not bring him entirely back from 
wherever it was he was. Wherefore, 
just before saying goodnight at the 
door of her apartment, she said: 

“You have something big on your 
mind, Blackie. Tremendously big. 
Would it help to come in and talk 
a while?” This was the first time in 
all their long acquaintance that she 
had ever invited him into her apart- 
ment. “Or wouldn’t it?” 

He thought for a moment. “No,” 
he decided. “There are so many 
maybes and ifs and buts in the way 
that talking would be even more 
futile than thinking. But I’d like 
to ask you this: how much longer 
will you be here in Washington, do 
you think?” 

She caught her breath. “The Ob- 
server says it’ll take me a year and 
and half to get what I should have.” 

“That’s fine,” DuQuesne said. His 
thoughts were racing, but none of 
them showed. What were those ob- 
servers doing? And why? He knew 
the kind of mind Stephanie de Mar-

IF 




igny had — they were feeding with a 
teaspoon a mind fully capable of 
gulping it down by the truckload . 
why? Whyl So as not to play fav- 
orites, probably — ^that was the only 
reason he could think of. DuQuesne 
was playing for very high stakes; he 
could not afford to overlook any pos- 
sibility, however remote. Had his in- 
terest in Hunkie de Marigny been 
deduced by the Norlaminians? Was 
it, in fact, possible — even likely — 
that he was under observation even 
now? Was their strange slowdown 
in her training meaningful? He could 
not answer; but he decided on cau- 
tion. He went on with scarcely a 
noticeable pause, “I’ll see you well 
before that — if I may?” 

“Why, of course you may! Fd get 
an acute attack of the high dudgeons 
if you ever came to Washington 
without seeing me!” 

He took his leave then, and she 
went into her apartment and closed 
the door . and stood there, mo- 
tionless, listening to his receding 
footsteps with a far-away, brooding 
look in her deep brown eyes, 

XVII 
The Coup 

A s the days had passed, more and 
more of the Skylarkers had 
come to ground in Seaton’s tempor- 
ary home on the planet Ray-See- 
Nee; until many of them, especially 
Dorothy, were spending most of 
their nights there. On this particular 
evening they were all there. 

Since the personal gravity-con- 
trols had been perfected long since, 



Dimark and Sitar were comfortable 
enough as far as gravity was con- 
cerned. The engineers, however, had 
not yet succeeded in incorporating 
really good ambient-atmosphere 
temperature-controllers into them; 
wherefore he was swathed in wool 
and she wore her fabulous mink 
coat. They each wore two Osndm- 
ian machine pistols instead of one, 
and they sat a couple of feet apart 
— in instant readiness for any action 
that might become necessary. 

Lotus and Shiro, a little closer to- 
gether than the two Osnomians but 
not enough so to get into each 
other’s way, sat cross-legged on the 
floor. He was listening intently, while 
she wasn’t. Almost everything that 
was being said was going completely 
over her head. 

Dorothy, Margaret, and Crane sat 
around a small table, fingering tall 
glasses in which ice-cubes tinkled 
faintly. 

Seaton paced the floor, with his 
right hand in his breeches pocket 
and his left holding his pipe, which 
he brandished occasionally in the 
air to emphasize a point. 

“Considering that we can’t do any- 
thing at all on unmuffled high-order 
stuff except when an ore-scow is 
here, masking our emanations,” 
Seaton was saying, “we haven’t done 
too bad. However, I wouldn’t won- 
der if we’d just about run out of 
time and we’re right between the 
devil and the deep blue sea. Mart, 
what’s your synthesis?” 

Crane sipped his drink and cleared 
his throat. “You’re probably right 
in one respect, Dick. They appar- 
ently make a spectacle of these de-

•tructions of cities; not for the 
Chlorans’ amusement — 1 doubt very 
much if they enjoy or abhor any- 
thing, as we understand the term — 
but to keep the rest of the popula- 
tion of this world in line. Whether 
or not the quisling dictator of this 
world arranged for this city to be the 
next sacrifice, it is certain that we 
have interfered with the expected 
course of events to such an extent 
that the powers-that-be will at least 
investigate. But I can’t quite see the 
dilemma.” 

“I can,” Dorothy said. “They 
have to have a grisly example, once 
every so often; and since this one 
didn’t develop on schedule maybe 
they’ll go crying to mama instead of 
trying to handle us themselves. You 
see, they may know more about us 
than we think they do.” 

“That’s true, of course — ” Crane 
began, but Seaton broke in. 

“So I say it’s time to let Ree-Toe 
Prenk in on the whole deal and add 
him to our Council of War,” he de- 
clared, and talk went on. 

They were still discussing the sit- 
uation twenty minutes later, when 
someone tapped gently on the front 
door. 

T he Osnomians leaped to their 
feet, pistols in all four hands. 
The two Japanese leaped to their 
feet and stood poised, knees and 
elbows slightly flexed, ready for ac- 
tion. Forty-five-caliber automatics 
appeared in the hands of the three 
at the table, and Crane flipped his 
remote control helmet onto his head. 
Seaton, magnum in hand, snapped 
on the outside lights and peered out 



through the recently installed one- 
way glass of the door. 

“Speak of the devil,” he said in 
relief. “It’s Hizzoner.” He opened 
the door wide and went on, “Come 
in, Your Honor. We were just talk- 
ing about you.” 

Prenk came in, his eyes bulging 
slightly at the sight of the arsenal 
of armament now being put back 
into holsters. They bulged still more 
as he looked at the Japanese, and 
he gulped as he stared fascinatedly at 
the green-skinned Osnomians. 

“I knew, of course, within a 
couple of days,” Prenk said then, 
quietly, “that you who call yourself 
Ky-El Mokak were not confining 
your statements to the exact truth. 
No wilder could possibly have done 
what you were doing; but by that 
time I knew that you, whoever you 
were, were really on our side. I had 
no suspicion until this moment, how- 
ever, that you were actually from an- 
other world. I thought that your 
speech to the miners was what you 
said it was going to be, ‘a shot in 
the arm of hope’. It now seems more 
than slightly possible that you were 
talking about the very matters I 
came here tonight to see you about. 
Certain supplies, you will remem- 
ber.” 

“I remember. I lied to you, yes. 
Wholesale and retail. But how else 
could I have made the approach, 
the mood you were in, without blow- 
ing everything higher than up?” 

“Your technique was probably the 
best possible, I admit.” 

“Okay. Yes, we’re from a galaxy 
so far away from here that you 
could barely find it with the biggest

IF 




telescope this world ever had. Our 
business at the moment is to wipe 
out every Chloran in this region of 
space, but we can’t do it without — 
among other things — a lot more 
data than we now have. And we’ll 
need weeks of time, mostly else- 
where, for preparation. 

“But before we go too deeply in- 
to that you must meet my assoc- 
iates. People, this is His Honor Ree- 
Toe Prenk; what you might call the 
Mayor of the City of Ty-Ko-Ma of 
the Planet Ray-See-Nee. You know 
all about him. Ree-Toe, this is Hi-Fi 
Mokak, my wife — Lo-Test and Hi- 
Test Crane, husband and wife — ” 
and he went on with two more pairs 
of coined names. 

“Hi-Fi indeedl’' Dorothy snorted, 
under her breath, in English. “Just 
you wait ‘til I get you alone tonight, 
you egregious clown!’’ 

“Wha’d’ya mean ‘clown’?” he re- 
torted. “Try your hand sometime at 
inventing seven names on the spur 
of the moment!” 

S eaton then put on a headset, 
slipped one over Prenk’s head, 
and said in thought: “This is what is 
left — the residue, you might say 
— of our mobile base the Skylark 
of Valeron,^^ and went on to show 
him and to describe to him the 
Great Brain, the immense tank- 
chart of the entire First Universe, 
the tremendous driving engines and 
even more tremendous engines 
of offense and of defense. 

Prenk was held spellbound and 
speechless, for this “residue”, hun- 
dreds of kilometers in diameter and 
hundreds of millions of tons in 



weight, was so utterly beyond any 
artificial structure Prenk had ever 
imagined that he simply could not 
grasp its magnitude at all. And 
when Seaton went on to show him a 
full mental picture of what that base 
had been before the battle witfi 
the Ghlorans and what it would 
have to be before they could begin 
to move against the ChJorans — 
the one-thousand kilometer control- 
circles, the thousands of cubic kilo- 
meters of solidly packed offensive 
and defensive gear, the scores of 
fantastically braced and buttressed 
layers of inoson that composed the 
worldlet’s outer skin — he was so 
strongly affected as to be speechless 
in fact. 

‘T . .1 see. That is ... a little, 
maybe . .” he stammered, then sub- 
sided into silence. 

“Yes, it is a bit big to get used to 
all at once,” Seaton agreed. “It needs 
a lot of work. Some we’re doing; 
some of it can’t be done anywhere 
near here; but we don’t want to leave 
without being reasonably sure that 
you and your people will be alive 
when we get back. So we want a 
lot of information from you.” 

“I’ll be glad to tell you every- 
thing I know or can find out.” 

“Thanks. Ideas, first. How much 
do you think the quisling Big Shots 
actually know? What do you think 
they’ll do about it? What do you 
think His Magnificence the Dictator 
will do? And what should we do 
about what he thinks he’s going to 
do? In a few days we’ll want all 
the information you can get — 
facts, names, dates, places, times, 
and personnel. Also one sample copy

«f each and every item of equipment 
desired; with numbers wanted and 
limes and places of delivery. Brother 
Frenk, you have the floor.” 

“One advantage of a small town 
tnd a group like ours,” Prenk said, 
slowly, “is that everybody knows 
everybody else’s business. Thus, we 
all knew who the spies were, but 
the people were all so low in their 
minds that they simply did not care 
whether they lived or died. We had 
done our best and had failed; most 
of us had given up hope complete- 
ly. Now, however, the few remain- 
ing spies have been locked up and 
are under control. They and the 
overseers are still reporting, but — ” 
he smiled wolfishly — “they are say- 
ing precisely and only what 1 tell 
them to say. This condition can’t 
last very long; but, after what you 
just showed me. I’m pretty sure I 
can make it last long enough. We 
have organized a really efficient 
force of guerilla fighters and our 
plans for the capital are . .” 

A couple of weeks later, then, 
three hundred fifty-eight high- 
ly trained men and one highly 
trained woman set out. 

A woman? Yes. Dorothy had pro- 
tested vigorously. 

“But Sitar! You aren’t going, sure- 
ly? Surely you’re staying home?” 
“Staying homeV* the green girl 
had blazed. “The First Wife of a 
prince of Osnome goes with her 
prince wherever he goes. She fights 
beside him, at need she dies beside 
him. Would you have him die fight- 
ing and me live an hour? I’d blow 
myself to bits!” 



“My God!” Dorothy had gasped, 
and had stared, appalled. 

“That’s right,” Seaton had told 
her. “Their ethics, mores and cus- 
toms differ more than somewhat 
from ours, you know.” And nothing 
more had been said about Sitar being 
a member of the Expeditionary 
Force. 

Prenk’s guerrillas had infiltrated 
the capital city by ones and twos; 
no group ever larger than two. Each 
one wore the costume of an easily 
recognizable class of citizen. They 
were apparently artisans and work- 
men, soldiers, sailors, clerks, busi- 
nessmen, tycoons of industry. Nor 
were the watches they all wore on 
their wrists any more alike than 
were their costumes — except in 
one respect. They all told the same 
time, to the tenth of a split second, 
and they all were kept in sync by 
pulses from a tiny power-pack that 
had been hidden in a tree in the 
outskirts of the city. 

At time zero minus thirty minutes, 
three hundred fifty-nine persons be- 
gan to enter into and to distribute 
themselves throughout an immense 
building that resembled a palace or 
a cathedral much more than the 
Capitol building even of a world. 

At time zero minus four sec- 
onds all those persons, who had in 
the meantime been doing inconspicu- 
ous this and innocuous that, changed 
direction toward or began to walk 
toward or kept on walking toward 
their objectives. 

At time zero on the tick, three 
hundred fifty-nine knives came out 
of concealment and that exact num- 
ber of persons fell. 



118 



IF 




S ome of the guerrillas remained on 
guard where their victims lay. 
Others went into various offices on 
various businesses. On the top-most 
floor four innocent-looking visitors 
blasted open the steel door of Com- 
munications and shot the four opera- 
tors then on duty. The leader of the 
four invaders stepped up to the mas- 
ter-control desk, shoved a body aside, 
flipped three or four switches, and 
said: 

“Your attention, please! These 
programs have been interrupted to 
announce that former Premier Da- 
Bay Saien and his sycophants have 
been executed for high treason. Pri- 
mier Ree-Toe Prenk and his loyal- 
ists are now the government. Busi- 
ness is to go on as usual; no new 
orders will be issued except as they 
become necessary. That is all. Sched- 
uled programs will now be resumed.” 
It was not as easy everywhere, 
however, as that announcement in- 
dicated. By the very nature of things, 
the information secured by the 
counterspies was incomplete and 
sometimes, especially in fine detail, 
was wrong. Thus, when Seaton took 
his post on the fifteenth floor, stand- 
ing before and admiring a heroic- 
size bronze statue of a woman 
strangling a boa constrictor whose 
coils enveloped half her height, he 
saw that there were four guards, in- 
stead of the two he had expected to 
find, at the door of the office that 
was his objective. But he couldn’t — 
wouldn’t — call for help. They 
hadn’t had man-power enough to 
carry spares. He’d trip the S O S if 
necessary, but not until it became 
absolutely necessary — but that of-

fice had to be put out of business 
time zero plus fifteen seconds. 
He’d just have to act twice as fast, 
was all. 

Cursing silently the fact that his 
magnum was not to be used during 
the first few silent seconds of the 
engagement, he watched the four 
men constantly out of the corners 
of his eyes, planning every detail 
of his campaign, altering those de- 
tails constantly as the guards chang- 
ed ever so slightly their positions 
and postures. He could get three 
of them, he was sii^e, before any 
one of them could fire; but he’d 
have to be lucky as well as fast to 
get the fourth in time — and if the 
ape had time to take any kind of aim 
at all it would be very ungood. 

On the tick of zero time Seaton 
shed his businessman’s cloak and 
took off. Literally. His knife swept 
through the throat of the nearest 
guard before that luckless \^ight had 
moved a muscle. He kicked the sec- 
ond, who was bending over at the 
moment, on and through the temple 
with the steel-lined toe of one high- 
ly special sure-grip fighting shoe. 
He stabbed the third, whose throat 
was protected at that instant by an 
upflung left arm, through the left 
side of the rib-cage, twisting his 
blade as he pulled it out. 

Ultra-fast - as Seaton had been, 
the fourth guard had had time to lift 
his weapon, but he had not had time 
to aim it, or even to point it prop- 
erly. He fired in panic, before his 
gun was pointed even waist-high. If 
Seaton had stayed upright the bullet 
would have missed him completely. 
But he didn’t. He ducked and side- 



stepped and twisted — and the 
heavy slug tore a long and savage 
wound across the left side of his 
back. 

One shot was all the fellow got, of 
course. Seaton kicked the door open 
and leaped into the room, magnum 
high and ready. The noise of that 
one shot might have tom it, but 
good. 

''Freeze, everybody!” he rasped, 
and everyone in the big room froze. 
“One move of any finger toward 
any button and I blast. This office 
is closed temporarily. Leave the 
building, all of you; right now and 
fast. Just as you are. Come back in 
here after lunch for business as us- 
ual. Scram!” 

T he office force — some non- 
chalantly, some wonderingly, 
some staring at Seaton in surprise 
— “scrammed” obediently. AH, that 
is, except one girl who came last; 
the girl who had been sitting at an 
executive-type desk beside the door 
of the inner office. She was a fairly 
tall girl; with hazel eyes and with 
dark brown hair arranged in up-to- 
the-second “sunburst” style. Her 
close-fitting white nylon i^pcr gar- 
ment and her even tighter fire-en- 
gine-red tights displayed a figure 
that could not be described as being 
merely adequate. 

Instead of passing him as the oth- 
ers had done she stopped, held out 
both hands in indication of having 
nothing except peaceable intentions, 
and peered around his left side. 
Then, bringing her eyes back to his, 
she said, “You’re bleeding terribly, 
sir. It doesn’t seem to be very deep

IF 




— entrance and exit holes in your 
shirt are only four or five inches 
apart — but you’re losing an awful 
lot of blood. Won’t you let me give 
you first aid? I’m a quite competent 
nurse, sir.” 

**What?'' Seaton demanded, but 
whatever he had intended to add 
to that one word was forestalled by 
a bellow of wrath from behind the 
just-opening door of the inner office. 

“Kay-Lee! You shirking slut! How 
much more of this do you think you 
can get away with? When I buzz 
you you jump or I’ll cut your bloody 
— ” The man broke off sharply and 
goggled at what he saw. He was a 
pasty-faced, paunchy man of forty; 
very evidently self-indulgent and as 
evidently completely at a loss at 
the moment. 

“Come in, Bay-Lay Boyn,” Sea- 
ton said. “Slowly, if you don’t want 
your brains to decorate the ceiling. 
Did you ever see a man shot in the 
head with a magnum pistol?” 

The man gulped and licked his 
lips. The girl broke the very short 
silence. “Whatever you do to that 
poisonous slob, sir, I hope it’s noth- 
ing trivial. I’d love to see his brains 
spattered all over the ceiling and 
I’d never let them be washed off. 
I’d look up at them week after 
week and gloat.” 

“Kay-Lee dear, you don’t mean 
that! You can't mean it!” the man 
implored. “Do something! Please do 
something! I’ll double your salary 

— I’ll make you a First — I’ll give 
you a diamond necklace — I’ll — ” 

“You’ll shut your filthy lying 
mouth. Your Exalted'^ she said — 
quietly, but with an icily venemous 



contempt that made Seaton stare. 
“I’ve taken all the raps for you I’m 
ever going to.” She turned to Seaton. 
“Please believe, sir, that no matter 
who your people are or what you 
do, any possible change will be for 
the better. And I remind you — 
if you don’t want to fall flat on your 
face from weakness you’ll let me 
dress that wound.” 

“I wouldn’t wonder,” Seaton ad- 
mitted. “Blood’s running down in- 
to my shoes already and it’s begin- 
ning to hurt like the devil. So get 
your kit. But before you start on 
me we’ll use some three-inch ban- 
dage to lash that ape’s hands around 
that pillor there.” 

T hat done, Seaton peeled to the 
waist and the girl went expert- 
ly to work. She sprayed the nasty- 
looking wound, which was almost 
but not quite a deep but open 
groove, with antiseptic and with 
coagulant. She cross-taped its ragged 
edges together with blood-proof ad- 
hesive tape. She sponged most of 
the liquid blood off of his back. 
She sprinkled half a can of cura- 
tive-antiseptic powder; she taped on 
thick pads of sterile gauze. She 
wrapped — and taped into place — 
roll after roll of three-inch bandage 
around his body and up over his 
shoulder and around his neck. Then 
she stood back and examined her 
handiwork, eyes narrowed in con- 
centration. 

“That’ll do it for a while,” she 
decided. “I suppose you’ll be too 
busy to take any time today, but 
you’ll have to get that sewed up 
not later than tomorrow forenoon.” 



SKYURK DuQUESNE

“m do that. Thanks a million, 
lady; it feels a lot better already,” 
and Seaton bent over to pick up his 
shirt and undershirt. 

‘‘But you can't wear those bloody 
rags!” she protested, then went on, 
“But I don’t know of anything else 
around here that you can wear, at 
that.” 

Seaton grinned. “No quandary — 
I’ll go the way I am. Costume or 
the lack of it isn’t important at the 
moment.” He glanced at his watch 
and was surprised to see how very 
few minutes had elapsed. 

“Shall I go now, sir?” 

“Not yet.” Seaton was used to 
making fast decisions, and they were 
usually right. He made one now. “I 
take it you were that ape’s confiden- 
tial secretary.” 

“Yes, sir, I was.” 

“So you know more about the 
actual workings of the department 
than he does and can run it as well. 
To make a snap judgment, can run 
it better than he has been running 
it.” 

“Much better, sir,” she said, flat- 
ly. “I’ve covered up for his drunken 
blunderings twice in the last two 
months. He passed the buck to me 
and I took it. A few lashes are much 
better than what he revels in doing 
to people; especially since he can’t 
touch me now. He knows that after 
taking his floggings I’d go under 
hypnosis and tell everything I know 
about him if he tried to lay a finger 
on me.” 

“Lashes? Floggings? I see.” Sea- 
ton’s face hardened. “Okay, you’re 
it.” He took a badge out of his 
pocket, slid its slip out of its holder. 



and handed the slip to Kay-Lee. 
“Type on this your name and his 
rating and title and turn your re- 
corder on.” 

She did so. He glanced at the 
slip, replaced it in its holder, and 
pinned the badge in place just above 
the girl’s boldly outstanding left 
breast. “I, Ky-El Mokak, acting for 
and with the authority of Premier 
Ree-Toe Prenk, hereby make you, 
Kay-Lee Barlo, an Exalted of the 
Twenty-Sixth and appoint you Head 
of the Department of Public Works. 
I hereby charge you. Your Exalted, 
to so operate your department as to 
prevent, not to cause, the destruc- 
tion of persons and of property by 
those enemies of all mankind the 
Chlorans.” He stepped to the desk; 
cut the recorder off. 

F or the first time, the girl’s taut 
self-control was broken. “Do 
you mean I can actually clean this 
pig-sty up?” she demanded, tears 
welling into her eyes. “That you 
actually want me to clean it up?” 
“Just that. You’ll be briefed at a 
meeting of the new department 
heads late this afternoon. In the 
rueantime start your house-cleaning 
as soon as you like after your peo- 
ple get back from lunch; and I 
don’t have to tell you how to act. 
Have you got or can you get a 
good hand-gun?” 

“Yes, sir, there’s a very good one 
— his — in his desk. I was trying to 
get up nerve enough to ask you for 
it.” 

“It’s yours as of now. Can you 
use it? That’s probably a foolish 
question.” 



122 



IF 




“I’ll say I can use it! I made 
Pistol Expert One when I was elev- 
en and I’ve been improving ever 
since.” 

“Fine!” He glanced again at his 
watch. “Go get it, be sure it’s loaded, 
buckle it on and wear it. Show your 
badge, play the recording and lay 
down the law. If there’s any argu- 
ment, shoot to kill. We aren’t fool- 
ing.” He glanced at the prisoner. 
“He’ll be out of your way. I’m tak- 
ing him downstairs pretty soon to 
answer some questions.” 

“I — I thank you, sir. I can’t 
tell you how much. But you — I 
mean . well, I — ” the girl was 
a study in mixed emotions. Her nos- 
trils flared and her whole body was 
tense with the beyond-imagining 
thrill of what had just occurred; but 
at the same time she was so acutely 
embarrassed that she could scarcely 
talk. “I want to tell you, sir, that 
I wasn't trying to curry . .” She 
broke off in confusion and gulped 
twice. 

“Curry? I know you weren’t. You 
aren’t the toadying type. That’s one 
reason you got it — but just a sec- 
ond.” 

He looked again at his watch and 
did not put it down; but in a few 
seconds raised the ring to his lips and 
asked, “Are you there, Ree-Toe?” 
“Here, Ky-El,” the tiny ring-voice 
said. 

“Mission accomplished, includ- 
ing selection and installation of de- 
partment head.” 

“Splendid! Are you hurt?” 

“Not badly. Scratch across my 
back. How’re we doing?” 

“Better even than expected. The 



Premier is dead, I don’t know yet 
exactly how. All your people are 
all right except for some not-too- 
serious wounds. Ours, only ten dead 
reported so far. The army came 
over to a man. You have earned a 
world’s thanks this day, Ky-El, and 
its eternal gratitude.” 

Seaton blushed. “Skip it, chief. 
Any change in schedule?” 

“None.” 

“Okay. Off.” Seaton, lowering 
his hand to his side, turned to Kay- 
Lee. 

She, who had not quite been able 
to believe all along that all this was 
actually happening to her, was star- 
ing at him in wide-eyed awe. “You 
are a biggie!” she gasped. “A great 
big biggie. Your Exalted, to talk to 
the Premier himself like that! So 
this unbelievable appointment will 
stick!” 

“It will stick. Definitely. So chin 
high and don’t spare the horses, 
Your Exalted; and I’ll see you at 
the meeting. Until then, so-long.” 

Seaton cut his prisoner loose and 
half-led, half-dragged him, gibber- 
ing and begging, out of the room. 
Almost Seaton regretted it was over; 
the work on Ray-See-Nee had been 
pleasurable, as well as useful. 

But — now he had his base of 
operations, unknown to the Chlo- 
rans, on a planet they thought safely 
their own. Now he could go on 
with his campaign against them. 
Seaton was well aware that the uni- 
verse held other enemies than the 
Chlorans, but his motto was one 
thing at a time. 

However, it is instructive now to 
see just what two of those inimical

DuQuesne and Fenachrone 

B efore the world of the Fenach- 
rone was destroyed by Civili- 
zation’s superatomic bombs it was 
a larger world than Earth, and a 
denser, and with a surface gravity 
very much higher. It was a world 
of steaming jungle; of warm and 
reeking fog; of tepid, sullenly steam- 
ing water; of fantastically lush vege- 
tation unknown to Earthly botany. 
Wind there was none, nor sunshine. 
Very seldom was the sun of that 
reeking world visible at all through 
the omnipresent fog, and then only 
as a pale, wan disk; and what of its 
atmosphere was not fog was hot and 
humid and sulphurously stinking 
air. 

And as varied the worlds, so var- 
ied the people. The Fenachrone, 
while basically humanoid, were re- 
pulsively and monstrously short, wide 
and thick. They were immensely 
strong physically, and their men- 
talities were as monstrous as their 
civilization was many thousands 
of years older than that of Earth; 
their science was equal to ours in 
most respects and ahead of it in 
some. 

Most monstrous of all the facets 
of Fenachrone existence, however, 
was their basic philosophy of life. 
Might was right. Power was not 
only the greatest good; it was the 
only good. The Fenachrone were the 



MASTER RACE, whose unquestion- 
able destiny it was to be the unques- 
tionable masters of the entire space- 
time continuum — of the summated 
totality of the Cosmic All. 

For many thousands of years 
nothing had happened to shake any 
Fenachrone’s rock-solid conviction 
of the destiny of their race. Progress 
along the Master-Race line had been 
uninterrupted. In fact, it had never 
been successfully opposed. The 
Fenachrone had already wiped out, 
without really extending them- 
selves, all the other civilizations 
within a hundred parsecs or so of 
their solar system. But up to the 
time of Emperor Fenor no ruler 
of the Fenachrone had become con- 
vinced that the time had come to 
set the Day of Conquest — the day 
upon which the Big Push was to 
begin. 

But rash, headstrong, egomaniacal 
Fenor insisted upon setting The Day 
in his own reign — which was why 
First Scientist Fleet Admiral Sleem- 
et had set up his underground so 
long before. He was just as patriotic 
as any other member of his race; 
just as thoroughly sold on the idea 
of the inevitable ultimate supremacy 
over all created things wherever 
situated; but his computations did 
not indicate that success was as yet 
quite certain. 

How right Sleemet was! 

He knew that he was right after 
hearing the first few words of Sac- 
ner Carfon’s ultimatum to Emperor 
Fenor: that was why he had pushed 
the panic button for the eighty-five- 
thousand-odd members of his fac- 
tion to flee the planet right then. 



124 



IF 




He knew it still better when, after 
Fenor’s foolhardy defiance of Sac- 
ner Carfon, of the Overlord, and of 
the Forces of Universal Peace, his 
native planet became a minor sun 
behind his flying fleet. 

Even then, however, Sleemet had 
not learned very much — at least, 
nowhere nearly enough. 

A t first glance it might seem in- 
credible that, after such an ex- 
perience, Sleemet could have so 
lightly destroyed two such highly 
industrialized worlds about which he 
knew so little. It might seem as 
though it must have been impressed 
upon his mind that the Fenachrone 
were not the ablest, strongest, wisest, 
smartest, most highly advanced and 
most powerful form of life ever 
created. Deeper study will show, 
however, that with his heredity and 
conditioning he could not possibly 
have done anything else. 

Sleemet probably did not begin 
really to realize the truth until the 
Llurd Klazmon so effortlessly — 
apparently — wiped out sixteen of 
his seventeen superdreadnoughts, 
then crippled his flagship beyond 
resistance or repair and sent it 
hurtling through space toward some 
completely unknown destination. 

His first impulse, like that of all 
his fellows, was to storm and to 
rage and to hurl things and to fight. 
But there was no one to fight; and 
storming and raging and hurling and 
smashing things did not do any good. 
In fact, nothing they could do elicit- 
ed any attention at all from their 
captors. 

Wherefore, as days stretched out 



endlessly and monotonously into 
endless and monotonous weeks, all 
those five-thousand-odd Fenachrone 

— males and females, adults and 
teen-agers and children and babies 

— were forced inexorably into a 
deep and very un-Fenachronian 
apathy. 

And when the hulk of the flag- 
ship arrived at the Llanzlanate on far 
Llurdiax, things went immediately 
from bad to worse. The volume of 
space into which the Fenachrone 
were moved had a climate exactly 
like that of their native city on their 
native world. All its artifacts — its 
buildings, and its offices and its 
shops and its foods and its drinks 
and its everything else — were 
precisely what they should have 
been. 

Ostensibly, they were encouraged 
to live lives even more normal than 
ever before (if such an expression 
is allowable); to breed and to de- 
velop and to evolve; and especially 
to perform break-throughs in science. 

Actually, however, it was prac- 
tically impossible for them to do 
anything of their own volition; be- 
cause they were being studied and 
analyzed and tested every minute of 
every day. Studied coldly and 
logically and minutely; with an utter- 
ly callous ferocity unknown to even 
such a ferocious race as the Fenach- 
rone themselves were. 

Hundreds upon hundreds of the 
completely helpless captives died — 
died without affecting in any small- 
est respect the treatment received 

by the survivors and as their 

utter helplessness struck in deeper 
and deeper, the Fenachrone grew 



SKYLARK DuQUESNE 



125 




steadily weaker, both physically and 
mentally. 

This was no surprise to their cap- 
tors, the Llurdi. Nor was it in any 
sense a disappointment. To them 
the Fenachrone were tools; and they 
were being tempered and shaped to 
their task . 

O n Earth, leaving Stephanie de 
Marigny’s apartment, Du- 
Quesne went back to the Capital D 
and took off on course one hundred 
seventy-five Universal — that is, five 
degrees east of Universal South. 
He went that way because in that 
direction lay the most completely 
unexplored sector of the First Uni- 
verse and he did not want company. 
Earth and the First Galaxy lay on 
the edge of the First Quadrant. 
Llurdiax and its Realm lay in the 
Second. So did the Empire of the 
Chlorans and his own imaginary 
planet Xylmny. The second galaxy 
along that false line, which might 
also attract Seaton, lay in the Third. 
He didn’t want any part of Richard 
Ballinger Seaton — yet — and this 
course was mathematically the best 
one to take to get out of and keep 
out of Seaton’s way. Therefore he 
would follow it clear out to the 
Fourth Quadrant rim of the First 
Universe. 

As the Capital D bored a hole 
through the protesting ether Du- 
Quesne took time out from his think- 
ings to consider women. First, he 
considered Stephanie de Marigny; 
with a new and not at all unpleas- 
ant thrill as he did so. He considered 
Sennlloy and Luloy and some un- 
attached women of the Jelmi. They 



all left him completely cold; and he 
was intellectually honest enough to 
know why and to state that “why” 
to himself. The Jelmi were so much 
older than the humanity of Earth 
that they were out of his class. He 
could stand equality — definitely; 
in fact, that was what he wanted 
— but he could not live with and 
would not try to live with any 
woman so demonstrably his super- 
ior. 

But Hunkie — ah, there was a 
man’s woman! His equal; his perfect 
equal in every respect; with a brain 
to match one of the finest bodies 
ever built. She didn’t play hard to 
get, she was hard to get; but once 
got she’d stay got. She’d stand at a 
man’s back ’till his belly caved in. 

Slowed to a crawl, as Universal 
speed goes, the Capital D entered 
the outermost galaxy of the Rim 
of the Universe and DuQuesne en- 
ergized his highest-powered projec- 
tor. He studied the Tellus-Type 
planets of hundreds of solar systems. 
Many of these planets were inhab- 
ited, but he did not reveal himself 
to the humanity of any of them. 

He landed on an uninhabited 
planet and went methodically to 
work. He bulldozed out an Area 
of Work. He set up his batteries of 
machine tools; coupling an automa- 
tic operator of pure force to each 
tool as it was set up. Then he started 
work on the Brain; which took longer 
than all the rest of the construction 
put together. It was an exact dupli- 
cate of that of the Skylark of Valer- 
on; one cubic mile of tightly packed 
ultra-miniaturized components; the 
most tremendous and most tremen- 



126 



IF 




dously capable super-computer 
known to man. 

While the structure of the two 
brains was identical, their fillings 
were not. As has been said, there 
were certain volumes — blocks of 
cells — in the Valeron's brain that 
DuQuesne had not been able to un- 
derstand. These blocks he left in- 
operative — for the time being. 
Conversely, DuQuesne either had or 
wanted powers and qualities and 
abilities that Seaton neither had nor 
wanted; hence certain blocks that 
were as yet inoperative in Seaton’s 
vast fabrication were fully opera- 
tive in DuQuesne’s. 

I t is a well-known fact that white- 
collar men, who sit at desks and 
whose fellowship with machines is 
limited to week-end drives in auto- 
mobiles, scoff heartily at the idea 
that any two machines of the same 
make and model do or can act dif- 
ferently from each other except by 
reason of wear. With increasing 
knowledge of an acquaintance with 
machines, however — especially 
with mechanisms of the more com- 
plex and sophisticated sorts — this 
attitude changes markedly. The men 
and women who operate such ma- 
chines swear unanimously that those 
machines do unquestionably have 
personalities; each its unique and 
peculiar own. 

Thus, while the fact can not be 
explained in logical or ‘‘common” 
sense terms, those two giants brains 



were as different in personality as 
were the two men who built them. 

Nor was DuQuesne’s worldlet, 
which he named the DQy very much 
like the Skylark of Valeron except 
in shape. It was bigger. Its skin 
was much thicker and much denser 
and much more heavily armed. The 
individual mechanisms were no 
larger — the Valeron" s . were the 
biggest and most powerful that Du- 
Quesne knew how to build — but 
there were so many of them that 
he was pretty sure of being safe 
from anyone. Even from whoever it 
was that had mauled the Valeron so 
unmercifully — whom he, Du- 
Quesne, did not intend to approach. 
Ever. 

It was, in fact, his prayerful 
hope that both mauler and maulee 
— Seaton himself — would ultimate^ 
ly emerge from that scuffle whittled 
down to a size where he would not 
have to consider them again. 

He did not, in fact, consider them; 
nor did he consider the captive 
Fenachrone in the pens of Llurdiax; 
nor the Jelmi; nor — and this, per- 
haps, was his greatest mistake — 
did he consider, because he did not 
know about, a mother and daughter 
of whose existence neither he nor 
any other Tellus-type human being 
had yet heard. 

He simply built himself the most 
powerspace vessel he could imagine, 
armed it, launched it . and set 
out to recapture the Universe Sea- 
ton had once taken away from him.

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet . 



Dear Editor: 

I’m afraid this is going to be an- 
other of those rambling commentar- 
ies on just about everything — so 
brace yourself. 

I’m glad to see you’ve finally 
started Skylark DuQuesne. Af- 
ter reading the first installment I 
conclude it was worth the wait. I 
was quite relieved to see that Smith 
is writing in the same general style 
as the other three Skylarks; it be- 
comes Seaton and his N-order forc- 
es. Not to mention adding continuity 
even after a lapse of more than 25 
years. One thing I’ve always ad- 
mired about Smith (not to mention 
Heinlein, Cordwainer Smith and a 
few others) is his skill at making 
his civilizations detailed. Burroughs 
did it, but clumsily, Heinlein does it 
in bits and snatches, and very few 
others do it. If makes the story more 
real if it seems to have a history 
behind it, and this adds to my en- 
joyment of a story. Others may find 
it a waste of words, which is fine 
with me — it’s a free country. 

Which brings up a question. What 
would you advise to a person with a 
detailed and realistic civilization. 



with a detailed history and culture, 
who lacks skill to write a really good 
story around it? 

I’m afraid I’ve become a Gree fan. 
The series is very Interesting^ and 
if it keeps up its standards it should 
become a Retief-type mainstay of 
the magazine (or has it already?). 
The first story of the four was the 
best; I’d like to see more of Jen. He 
sparks up the stories a little, and 
makes a much better protection than 
a ‘^Gunner’s Uniform” when in a 
hive. Unless I’m mistaken, there 
will soon be an announcement of a 
novel, and in this novel Earth will 
be taken. Or will that be their Holy 
Grail? I should think Gree’s forces 
will eventually wise up to Duke’s 
(thrice-used) method and there 
ought to be some really good stories. 

As to your ‘‘Out of the Idiot Box” 
editorial : What makes you think 
that by the time UHF is big and 
strong it won’t be just as bad as 
VHF? UHF is not a cure-all for the 
ills of TV. Even at the present there 
are very few stations which do not 
rely on thrown away VHF shows 
and movies plus a few inexpensive 
local telecasts. It would take a 



128 




■trong, wealthy organization to have 
the kind of network (it would have 
to be a network) you suggest. They 
would need to be strong to absorb 
the losses they would incur until the 
public sensed the superiority of 
their programming. Another dis- 
advantage that must be overcome is 
reception. The UHF adaptors now 
included on TV sets bring in UHF 
poorly, at best. (Possibly this is a 
local condition, but I doubt it.) The 
ultimate responsibility lies with the 
general viewing public, and from 
past performance they are not go- 
ing to be any help. The only thing 
that could be done now is national- 
ization, but that is not much of a 
practical solution. 

The only difference between VHF 
and UHF is frequency, and frequen- 
cy doesn^t make a station good. 

As for the lettercol, don^t expand 
it, just print it in the microscopic 
type of the old days. That way 
you'd get more letters in, and 
wouldn't offend those who are 
against letters. 

The rating space suggested in the 
June issue would be great, it's got 
my vote. 

More Cordwainer Smith (who is 
he, for real?), more Laumer, more 
MacApp, more Leinster, more new- 
comers (best idea in sf history), and 
more you ( ! ) . 

In response to David Lyon, could 
it be C.H. Fontenay's Silk and the 
Song he's after? They seem to be 
the same story. Maybe Crystal 
Tower was a long adaption of it? 

If you could improve your covers 
you'd improve your circulation. I 
think you ought to keep the style 
you had on the Jan. 1964 issue as 
a permanent fixture. At least keep 
a white border around the illo, and 
let Morrow do more of those — he's 
the best illustrator I've seen in

Ct., Rockville, Md. 20852. 

# If you've got a good idea for a 
story, there's only one thing to do. 
Write it. It's really the only way 
. unless you happen to know a 
writer who's short on ideas. But 
with most sf writers they'd rather 
think up their own. — Editor,

Dear Editor: 

I bought the April issue of If a 
few days ago, the first I'd seen in 
a couple of years. I must say that 
it is much improved. Gree*s Hellcats 
was very good; how about some 
more by C. C. MacApp? Did he 
write The Slaves of Creel Also, is 
it possible to get some back issues of 
//?— John W. Cook, Box 211, Har- 
lem, Georgia 30814. 

• Yes, MacApp wrote all the Gree 
stories — including Greeks P'^r.ined 
Ones, coming up next month. And 
you can get back copies of If, Galaxy 
or Worlds of Tomorrow at 50c a 
copy, regardless of original cover 
price, by writing our Back Number 
Department care of this magazine. 
Only issues for the years 1959-1964 
inclusive are available at present. —

axy for a couple of years now and

Kenosha, Wisconsin.

Dear Editor: 

I just finished your two-parter. 
The Altar at Asconel, and thought 
it was fine. Let's have more of this 
type of story, the adventure type 
as made famous by Burroughs, 
Howard and others of their school. 
Keep up your good work. Inciden- 
tally, if anyone is interested I have 

129 




a fairly large stock of science-fiction 
magazines I would like to sell — Bill 
Franklin, P.O. Box 1823, Hickory, 
North Carolina. 

♦ ♦ ♦ 

Dear Editor: 

IVe seen how readers try to locate 
stories through Hue and Cry and 
IVe helped two in finding them. 
Now I wonder if somebody might be 
able to help me. 

I'm trying the first sf magazines 
I ever read. One of them had a cover 
showing a large, glittering diamond 
on which two women were fighting. 
The story concerned a plot by other- 
dimensional beings to kidnap hu- 
mans by luring them into “dia- 
monds” by sexual enticements. Once 
one of these “diamond” gateways is 
used, it takes on the look of a burnt- 
out fuse. An agent from a top sec- 
ret intelligence organization enters 
the other dimension and rescues the 
prisoners but leaves the gate open 
to await a time when the aliens can 
be destroyed. 

Another had a story called Pink 
Pu/ppy Dog which dealt with aster- 
oid mining. As I recall the same 
magazine carried stories about two 
men in some horrible future war 
killing each other over a last bit of 
beauty (a flower) and a time when 
the Earth is dying and almost de- 
populated and one person goes kill- 
crazy. 

There was one about a time when 
the population explosion was so 
great that the forests were removed 
to house people. The hero is arrested 
on suspicion of killing an old man 
because he owned some wood but it 
develops that the hero could explain 
having wood because he had been 
growing a tree in secret. 

Another was about the reactions 
of a spaceship crew to the new cap- 



tain: a woman. Space travel is pic- 
tured as almost slavery. I recall that 
the radiation had made everybody 
on the ship bald. — James Edward 
Turner, Box 161, Pilot Knob, Mis- 
souri 63663.

Dear Editor: 

Retief was the 'cause of me buy- 
ing If regularly. By what lucky 
chance did you get Laumer to sell 
the Retief stories to you exclusive- 
ly? — Arthur W. Jordin, 711 McCal- 
lis Avenue, Chattanooga, Tennes- 
see 37403. 

# No chance about it, friend! We 
saw the first one, we liked it, we 
demanded more — and Laumer, who 
is an obliging soul, has just quit his 
Air Force captaincy to devote full 
time to turning them (and other 
first-rate science fiction) out; so 
there'll be more in the future! 

That would seem to be about as 
far as the type stretches this issue. 
As you Old Hands know, in each is- 
sue of If we bring you a story by a 
New Hand, a writer who hasn't ever 
before been published and who looks 
to us like someone who should be. 
This month's is J.M. McPadden, ex- 
naval officer and someone you'll be 
seeing again. (That's an easy pre- 
diction for us to make this time: 
We already own another of McFad- 
den's stories, called Mercuryy up- 
coming soon.) 

And speaking of Firsts, next 
month we start something that 
strikes us as a First. If you don't 
know yet what it is you obviously 
skipped the editorial this issue. Take 
a look at it. We think you'll agree 
that if not totally unprecedented, it 
is at least an unusual thing for a 
magazine to do — and a pleasant one !
