Do you have 
a restless urge 
to write? 



If you do, here is an opportunity 
for you to take the first 

Bennett Cerf, the distinguished 

important step to success in writing fhe^uw^ng S 

the Famous Writers School. 




There’s something different about peo- 
ple who feel the urge to write. They have 
a spiritual hunger that sets them apart — 
even from family and friends. 

If you have known this burning need 
to write, you, too, may have the gift suc- 
cessful authors possess. 

They know that this restless urge for 
self-expression is perhaps the most im- 
portant ingredient of writing success. 
But, they realize it can waste away if 
you don’t know how to get started writ- 
ing, or if you hesitate to try. 

Several years ago a group of famous 
authors including Rod Serling, Faith 
Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, Bruce Catton, 
and several others joined forces to start 
the Famous Writers School. They poured 
everything they know about writing into 
a remarkable new kind of professional 
training course which trains you at home 
in your spare time. You begin with the 
fundamentals of all good writing. Then 
you get advanced training in the specialty 
of your choice. 

Each of your assignments is examined 
by an instructor who is a professional 
writer or editor. He goes over your work 
word by word, blue-penciling changes 
right on your manuscript. Then he re- 
turns it to you with a long letter of ad- 



vice on how to improve your writing. 

This training works well. Our students 
have sold their writing to hundreds of 
publications. 

Free Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you, too, have writing 
ability worth developing, send for the 
School’s revealing Aptitude Test. If you 
test well, or offer other evidence of writ- 
ing aptitude — you may enroll. However, 
there is no obligation to do so.

WHAT HAPPENED ON 
18 DECEMBER 1955? 

FREDERIKPOHL 



WE’VE MENTIONED before in 
these pages the hun.dreds of hunks 
of hardware in orbit around 
Earth. Artificial satellites. Boos- 
ters. Pieces and bits that became 
detached from same. The debris 
resulting when unexpended fuel 
exploded or was made to explode. 
‘a few years ago we visited the 
headquarters of the international 
Sky Watch at the Harvard-Smith- 
sonian Astrophysical Observatory 
in Cambridge, Mass., and 
watched the computers chug- 
ging out the orbital courses of all 
those space objects. It was an im- 
pressive sight, a lot like observing 
the occupants of a nursery school 
all diligently adding 2 to 2 to get 
4. One did not feel that anything 
very exciting would come of it, al- 
though, to be sure, it was some- 
thing that obviously ought to be 
done. 

Something rather interesting 
has come of it now. 

Consider the observations of 
that particular celestial chunk 



called Explorer 26. Like all the 
others, it was watched carefully 
and the parameters of its orbit 
noted. Inclination to the equator: 
a little over 19.9 degrees. Apogee: 
about 26,060 kilometers. Perigee: 
about 260 kilometers. Until De- 
cember, 1965. (That’s nineteen 
sfx/y-five. We haven’t come to 
nineteen JiJtyAwe yet.) 

All of a sudden, in that Decem- 
ber, the parameters changed. The 
orbit flattened, the apogee shrank, 
the perigee expanded. Not much. 
The change in the inclination was 
less than a tenth of a degree. At 
its farthest, the satellite reached 
less than a hundred kilometers 
closer than it had before (out of 
better than 26,000 kilometers); at 
its closest, it approached Earth to 
a point only 40 kilometers farther 
away than before. 

But all three changes happened 
at once — changes in apogee, per- 
igee and inclination. Moreover, 
similar changes were observed, at 
other times, in th6 orbits of other 
satellites. 



Now, what does that suggest? 

Well, for one thing it might in- 
dicate an application of the kind 
of reasoning that led Leverrier in 
1846, and Lowell early in this 
century, to suspect the existence 
of the planets we now call Nep- 
tune and Pluto. If a body in a 
regular orbit is deflected out of 



2 



GALAXY 



that orbit, there has to be a rea- 
son. If you can’t find any other 
reason, you start looking for some 
body in orbit whose gravitational 
pull may have done the job. And 
if you have enough observations to 
work on, and the time and pa- 
tience to do the work, you can cal- 
culate where that body ought to be 
and even get some rough idea of 
its orbit and mass. 

John Bagby of Hughes Air- 
craft thought along those lines. 
Writing in the spaceflight journal, 
Icarus, he described what hap- 
pened next. There are about 150 
cases of changes in satellite orbits; 
unfortunately no one “undiscov- 
ered” body can account for all of 
them, but if you assume that per- 
haps ten such bodies exist, you 
can pretty well fit all the data. 

The next job was to look for the 
bodies. 

Last year a through photogra- 
phic search was made. Two such 
bodies did turn up on the plates, 
— right where the data promised 
they would be. 

So it would seem from the evi- 
dence that there are satellites of 
Earth other than the Moon or the 
ones we humans put aloft. 

But that’s not the end of the 
story. 

Once you know the elements of 
a body’s orbit, you can of course 
predict its future or trace its past. 
Tracing the past of the orbits of 
the newly discovered bodies show- 



ed something most interesting, in- 
deed. Their orbits intersected. On 
December 18, 1955, they had all 
been in the saime place. 



Fine. What happened on De- 
cember 18,1955? 

What it looks like is that there 
was a much larger body which di- 
vided into ten or so smaller ones. 

The presently discovered satel- 
lites are not very big; they run 
around a hundred feet in diame- 
ter. The parent satellite which 
broke up to produce them would 
of course have been larger — per- 
haps a little over 200 feet in dia- 
meter if all the bodies were 
spheres, even grossly imperfect 
spheres. 

It is more than a century since 
Roche showed mathematically 
that any natural satellite ap- 
proaching too close its planet 
would break up. That’s what is 
called “Roche’s limit.” It ac- 
counts for the rings of Saturn. 
You can view the phenomenon 
either way, depending on which 
theory of planet formation you 
like: either a large natural satel- 
lite breaks up to produce rings, or 
the little chunks of debris that 
fall together to produce large na- 
tural satellites are prevented from 
doing so. Either way, within 
Roche’s limit natural satellites, if 
above a certain size, cannot exist;

C REEPING from the con- 
gested traffic on the Holly- 
wood Freeway, Kendy’s bus 
crawled along the Harbor Free- 
way through the sunshine-tinted 
smog and finally inched down 
an off-ramp. On Exposition Boul- 



evard he blinked at the ancient 
Coliseum, still surrounded by 
barbed wire. Everything south 
was in Nairobi. 

He walked north. The Nation- 
al Guardsman at the entry gate 
to the University merely glanced 
at his thick plastic preregistra- 
tion card and motioned him on 



5 



without searching his suitcase. 
Kendy’s smile relaxed. Infiltrat- 
ing U.S.C. seemed so easy. 

Sometimes his world seemed 
like a satire and ' he looked 
around cautiously. Mr. Smith 
had told him there were fewer 
National Guardsmen here than 
at other universities this size. 

All you have to do is blend 
with the freshmen. Never let 
them know you’re from National 
University. Simply penetrate 
security. Photograph the centri- 
fuge. Then enjoy the rest of the 
semester. Learn to get along with 
strangers. Who knows? You're 
young. Maybe during your life- 
time — maybe you’ll be the one 
chosen to meet those galactic 
beepers face to face'. Assuming 
they have faces . 

Kendy squinted in the after- 
noon sunlight. 

His cheeks burned faintly as 
he strode along University Boul- 
evard, an impressive pedestrian 
mall through the campus. The 
pavement seemed to vibrate un- 
der his feet. The low hedge along 
its center strip failed to conceal 
green-painted ventilators shaped 
like duncecaps. He guessed they 
led down into the building he 
sought. 

Mr. Smith had said the Con- 
gressional Research and Devel- 
opment Building extended be- 
neath University Boulevard for 
five blocks — a horizontally bur- 
ied skyscraper. Kendy wondered 
what was so important about its 
biochemical centrifuge. 

Don’t get caught. They’ll stuff 



you and mount you in Heritage 
Hall. If they catch you, you 
flunk. If you get a few pics of 
the centrifuge — mail them quick. 
You pass. U.S.C. will have 
flunked the test. They will have 
let their security be violated. We 
want to get the captain of their 
Campus National Guard re- 
placed by a younger and more 
forceful officer. You will have 
done your job. You can relax, en- 
joy your Federal Premarital Sub- 
sidy. That’s what you wanted 
isn’t it? 

Not quite . 

Kendy walked faster, feeling 
more nervous than excited. He 
tried to imagine what she would 
be like. He supposed a compat- 
ibility computer would not make 
a bad mistake. But he had 
learned how devious Mr. Smith 
was. 

If you get restless after you’ve 
photographed the centrifuge and 
played house — rub on some 
Passblack and visit Nairobi . 

To do so seemed a stupid way 
to get mobbed or arrested. To 
infiltrate Russia might be easier. 
Kendy wondered what kind of 
education Mr. Smith had been 
trying to give him. He had 
learned Russian, not Swahili, at 
National U. The world was con- 
fusing. But at least he was almost 
free. 

A t the busy intersection of 
■ University Boulevard with 
Childs Way he peered down into 
the subwaylike entrance to the 
Congressional Research and De- 



6 



GALAXY 



velopment Building. Through a 
glass door he could see a Guards- 
man seated at a metal desk. On 
its side was stenciled: SHOW 
YOUR F PASS. Apparently 
Mr. Smith expected him to fig- 
ure out how to get past the door 
guard. 

But not today. 

He turned away. At the oppo- 
site corner of the intersection 
stood Tommy Trojan. Up there 
on his stone pedestal the bronze 
warrior was clutching his shield 
and sword. Kendy felt confront- 
ed for an instant — but he noticed 
Tommy was glaring past him. 
The statue seemed to be looking 
across University Boulevard to- 
ward Campus National Guard 
Headquarters. 

The low, concrete-block build- 
ing crouched on the lawn in front 
of the ornate old Doheny Li- 
brary. Like an invader? Kendy 
knew conflicting feelings. He 
could see the clash of architec- 
tural styles between the head- 
quarters and other campus struc- 
tures. But he had been taught 
that the Guardsmen were here to 
defend the university. 

He walked toward their com- 
munity relations car and smiled 
with curiosity. Three corroded 
nozzles protruded from its turret. 
He wondered what aerosols they 
had squirted during the first 
years of the Emergency. With 
his thumbnail he scraped corro- 
sion from the metal louvers that 
protected its radiator. 

Nine — no, ten years had 
passed since the National Emer- 



gency began. He had been only 
seven. Now it was difficult for 
him to imagine what the coun- 
try had been like before his fa- 
ther was — he winced and stopped 
that thought. 

He was not sure how he felt to- 
ward the permanent campus Na- 
tional Guard. There were no 
Guardsmen at National — the 
only university without them. 
The place had been designed and 
sociologically structured after 
the National Emergency had 
been declared. 

He touched a sun-aged tire of 
the armored car. Obviously these 
Guardsmen no longer drove it 
much. He had never seen one of 
these old armored cars in action 
or even on newscasts. It was as 
if they did not exist. " 

Yesterday he had been shown 
a huge new rocket. It gleamed 
impressively in his television 
screen. Some day it would blast 
off for Mars. Our ship. 

The Russians were strange, he 
thought. After their landing on 
Phobos, Mars’ inner moon, they 
had retreated. They were search- 
ing our Moon like madmen. 
They had found something and 
had inflated a dome over it. And 
they were sabotaging radio-tele- 
scopes all over the world. They 
seemed afraid someone would be 
able to translate the space beeps 
— and even more afraid that 
someone would succeed in answer- 
ing the beepers. 

Kendy considered his universe 
confusing. This old -armored car 
seemed almost prehistoric. But 



TOMORROW CUM LAUDE

it was here, where he was. And 
on its tire some student trouble- 
maker had chalked the enigmatic 
word: HORSE. 

' , Kendy blinked. 

Most of these Trojans didn’t 
seem to notice the National 
Guardsmen or him. He watched 
an amorous couple amble past 
as he once more lifted his suit- 
case. With a nervous smile of ex- 
pectation he strode along Childs 
Way, looking for his assigned 
dorm tower. 

He supposed Federal Premari- 
tal and Marital Subsidies were in- 
tended to keep the students inter- 
ested in each other instead of 
politics. 

He saw a Guardsman walking 
to-ward him, carring a police-type 
shotgun by its top handle. Even 
though he had a minicamera 
concealed in his suitcase, he felt 
at ease and smiled. The stubby 
shotgun made him feel at home. 
He had trained with one in the 
armory at National University, 
had learned how to disassemble 
one in the dark. 

He had felt revulsion and ex- 
citement. The weapon was a 
cutie. It was only twenty-seven 
inches long because its eighteen- 
inch barrel and receiver extended 
through the stock to within a few 
inches of the butt plate. He re- 
membered its many skull-rattling 
blasts, its twelve-gauge shotgun 
shells exploding so close to his 
cheek. 

Power. 

Although he knew it had been 
manufactured for police forces 



8 



GALAXY 



since before the Emergency, it 
looked weirdly futuristic to him. 
The plastic bulge above the bar- 
rel — in front of the carrying han- 
dle — contained a focusable flash- 
light. 

At night this Guardsman 
could aim its beam of light and 
the pattern of buckshot would ex- 
actly fill the bright circle — bam, 
bam. bam. Kendy thought it more 
than adequate for silencing noisy 
students. 

He grinned and shrugged. Mr. 
Smith had told him that U.S. C. 
enjoyed more permissive free- 
dom than most universities. Per- 
haps this was because it had been 
a private school before the Dec- 
laration of National Emergency. 
Guardsmen had indiscriminately 
occupied all universities in order 
to protect the government’s in- 
vestment in research facilities 
when the Emergency began. And 
ten years later the Guardsmen 
were still here. 

W HEN he crossed Hoover — 
the street, not the boule- 
vard — he was astonished to see a 
Black Man. A plastic-green pass 
was pinned on his white coveralls. 
Kendy blinked. That was an F on 
the pass. The Black Man walked 
unchallenged into a building. The 
door guard never even glanced at 
him. 

Before Kendy could get over 
that shock he saw a second Black 
Man. This one wore a gray flan- 
nel suit and carried a book. Ken- 
dy felt off balance and not from 
the weight of his suitcase. There 



hadn’t been a single Black at Na- 
tional University. As several 
more walked by he felt more — 
uncomfortable. He wondered 
what they were thinking. He sup- 
posed they returned each night 
to Nairobi-Watts. 

Here came one in a flamboy- 
ant robe. Kendy looked away. 
He was having disturbingly hap- 
py recollections of playing with 
children who must have been 
Negroes. Of course, that had 
been before the National Emer- 
gency. 

Three more strolled toward 
him. One of them was a girl. He 
realized his reaction was naive, 
perhaps laughable. He was feel- 
ing uneasy, yet fascinated. Nat- 
urally their clothing looked 
strange to him. His teevee could 
not receive the Black Channels 
and suddenly he felt as if he were 
the one who had been isolated. 
And he was afraid. He felt as 
strange as if he and they were 
from different planets. He did 
not know what to believe about 
recent U.S. history. 

He crossed McClintoek Ave- 
nue and saw his dorm tower — 
Premarital A-2. He hoped he 
would be able to adjust to all this 
pre-Emergency type confusion 
and freedom at U.S.C. 

Nervously he took out his pre- 
registration card and approached 
the portcullis of the concrete 
dorm. 

He shoved his card into the 
slot. The iron door clicked open. 
As he entered the hallway he 
heard the door close behind him. 



TOMORROW CUM LAUDE

He stood in front of the AD- 
MINISTRATION BOX, con- 
fronted the IDENTIFICATION 
LENS. He saw his own reflec- 
tion. 

Something buzzed. He sup- 
posed he had better hurry and 
insert his plastic card into the 
REGISTRATION SLOT. This 
stopped the buzzing. He heard a 
clank and hoped all his preregis- 
tration forms — which Mr. Smith 
had mailed from a counterfeit 
prep school — were properly re- 
corded. He had thought they 
were. U.S.C. had mailed back 
this preregistration card to his 
nearest National Guard Head- 
quarters, so everything should be 
all right. 

He heard a rattling sound. A 
brass key slid out. He grabbed 
it, expecting to find his room 
number assignment on one side 
or the other. The key was blank. 
Perhaps the room keys were not 
numbered as a security measure. 
A lost key was less a liability that 
way. 

The box buzzed and disgorged 
his card. As his fingers closed 
on it he saw it had been altered. 
The letters PRE, formerly im- 
bedded in its semiliquid core, had 
been dispersed, leaving him with 
a completed REGISTRATION 
CARD. He locked its chain 
around his neck and peered 
through its integral lens into its 
plastic depths, hunting for his 
room assignment. 

He saw his thumbprint still 
sparkling inside the card. Its 
whorls were shaped from metal- 



lic dust. Within a flattened uni- 
verse of glittering specks his facial 
galaxy grinned at him. Above it 
shimmered the flecks of gallium 
arsenide in ^shich his falsified aca- 
demic records had been recorded. 
Although he had spent last year 
as a freshman at National Univer- 
sity, this card innocently showed 
he had been a senior at a prep 
school which did not exist. 

He watched the metalized he- 
lixes of his more basic informa- 
tion quivering. Below them was 
a new array of microscopic glitter 
arranged into words and he 
smiled. It uas his class schedule. 
All three courses had been con- 
firmed. Stiffening with excite- 
ment, he found the number 943 
gleaming in the room space. His 
room was on the ninth floor 
of Premarital Dorm A-2. Room 
Number 943. 

F eeling both homy and 
frightened, he lurched across 
the entry hall to the bank of ele- 
vators and pressed the button for 
the ninth floor. Up there in the 
smoothly carpeted hallway, with 
admirable cool, be ambled to his 
assigned room. He smoothed 
back his blond hair. Taking a 
last deep breath, he thrust his 
key into the lock, twisted it. The 
door popped open. 

At her dressing table, the girl 
turned around with a startled 
smile. 

“What room are you looking 
for?” she asked, standing up 
with an audible swish of her 
black-and-gold malkia robe.

“This one, I thought.” 

He felt his cheeks burning as 
he took a backward step, won- 
dering how she had managed to 
get into the wrong room. 

“That old computer must have 
made a mistake on your card,” 
she said. “I guess we both can see 
that I’m expecting somebody 
else!” 

“Yeah, I’m sorry. I thought 
this was my room.” 

“Give me your card and I’ll 
find out what your room number 
should be.” Rising, with her hair 
frothy-black and silver-sequined 
in a towering natural that made 
her seem as tall as he was, she 
reached for his card with slender 
fingers. “Bahati — ema,” the girl 
sighed, poking his card into the 
administrative slot in the wall. 
She altered her soft voice to the 
distinct computspeak accent the 
system could understand and 
asked for his room number. 
“Photofaxed, please.” 

She turned her head. Her hair 
seemed to float like a weightless 
crown. Shyly Kendy smiled be- 
cause he was fascinated. She 
seemed so different from Helen, 
the only girl with whom he had 
ever made love. 

The photofaxer extended its pa- 
per tongue. The Black frowned. 
Kendy felt embarrassed. On the 
white paper, printed below his 
Birth Security Number was this 
room number, 943. 

“I’m sorry,” she murmured. 
“I didn’t realize I’d — wait a 
minute.” 

She inserted her own card in

SEPTEMBER, and the mad, wild 
beauty of the St. LouisCorv is over 
(but won't be actually by the 
time you read this). Never mind. 
Traditionally, in publishing, Sep- 
tember is a good reading month. 
Summer doldrums are over, the 
Icids are back in school, everyone 
is thinking in a serious-minded 
way about the long, hard, in- 
tellectual winter ahead. So Sep- 
tember is a big, big publishing 
month.

WE are celebrating it with 
George MacDonald's very kooky 
Kafkaesque fantasy LILITH. What 
is almost as extraordinary as the 
novel itself is the idea that 
anything as modern as this was 
written back in the I890's by a 
Scottish (sometime) minister of 
advanced years. You'll recognize 
it by the superb Gervasio cover 
of a man in an attic. 



AND in September, s.f.'s maior 
novel of the year — ^STAND ON 
ZANZIBAR, by John Brunner. Not 
an easy book to read (clearly a 
bit beyond those mainstream re- 
viewers). This is a jagged, frac- 
tionated, panoramic view of over- 
populated times to come — ^the 
style itself expressive of the ex- 
plosive tensions generated by too 
goddamned many people. The 
theme is well known to all of us. 
The handling is very special in-

THIS month also — O happy 
month — Larry Niven's volume of 
short stories which we titled THE 
SHAPE OF SPACE. Because it 
occurred to us that of all the new 
young writers, Larry's worlds are 
probably the most ingeniously 
specific. The shape of his par- 
ticular space is very definite, very 
much his own. Thank whatever 
gods there may be that he is also 
a very good writer, so we can 
all enjoy. 

SEPTEMBER is TOLKIEN month 
too — a promotion yet — although 
he is our candidate for the author 
than whom no one needs promo- 
tion less; and a peculiar wisp of a 
book titled THE BEGAHING OF 
A PRESIDENT. It's very in to be 
anti-Nixon. Not that we're terri-

the communications slot and 
asked the same question about 
herself. The paper tongue ex- 
tended a little farther, revealing 
the same room number. 

“That’s impossible.” She 
laughed angrily. “Listen, you — 
machine. My first name happens 
to be Amani. Amani Johnson. 
Try again. What’s my room 
number?” 

The system kept repeating 
943. It would not admit error. 
Neither would she. 

“One of us is in the wrong 
room.” 

Kendy lifted his suitcase. 

“Sorry to bother you,” he 
muttered and backed into the 
empty hall. • 

“Maybe you’re supposed to be 
in another tower,” she called. 
“I’m going to phone my rafiki. 
She’s a sophomore. She’ll know 
how to find out what room you’re 
really assigned to. You wait in 
the rec room. It’s at the end of 
the hall.” 

He glanced at the elevator as 
he retreated along the hall. At- 
tention was what he did not want 
to attract. His falsified records 
had been accepted by the com- 
puter. To be questioned now by 
a live administrator was some- 
thing he wanted to avoid. He 
could hear Amani’s suddenly 
plaintive voice addressing the 
phone. He hoped the wires were 
not being monitored. 

He stared through the west 

! window of the rec room at the 
fiery glare of sunset behind the 
silhouetted buildings. It made

him think of a terrifying night 
he had known as a small boy. 
He looked down. He did not see 
many students in the gloom on 
Childs Way. He supposed most 
freshmen would not move in un- 
til Sunday night — or Monday, 
when classes would begin. 

Maybe he should hide in an 
empty room until then. He was 
sweating. He felt unsure — he 
was not yet used to feeling like 
a spy. 

Every time he heard the ele- 
vator stop at this floor he was 
afraid it was delivering a Guards- 
man. If they searched his suit- 
case, they’d never let him out of 
the Detention Camp. Feeling 
paranoid, he hurried toward the 
elevator. 

He heard voices from Amani’s 
room, a giggling voice and an 
angry voice. The angry voice was 
hers. He scowled and raised his 
knuckles to knock but changed 
his mind. The door opened any- 
way. 

H e looked past the girl 
standing in the doorway. 
Amani glared at him from across 
the room. 

“Ooh, he is,” the other girl gig- 
gled. She was much lighter com- 
plexioned than Amani and very 
pretty, Kendy thought. Her hair 
had been straightened into limp 
bangs and there was nothing 
Nairobian about her pants-suit. 
‘ ‘Ki valuana-eupe — ’ ’ 

She giggled toward Amani and 
her hand covered her mouth. 
She slid past him into the hall. 



her eyebrows rising as if she were 
properly horrified. Her giggles 
reached him from the elevator. 

He felt like a fool. 

“Either come in or go out,” 
Amani said. “I’m leaving.” 

“I didn’t mean to — ” 

“You’re not. I’m coming back 
on Monday to tell those admin- 
istrators to fix it. Someone didn’t 
tell the computer. Charlene says 
he’s transferred to Cal Tech. He 
didn’t even have the decency to 
tell me. Anyway there’s some- 
thing wrong with their com- 
puter.” 

He, Kendy thought. Apparently 
she had expected to be matched 
with her own Main Man, as if it 
were prearranged. For an instant 
Kendy wondered if Mr. Smith 
had mixed things up, rearranged 
room assignments. But he was un- 
able to understand why. 

“I’m sorry.” 

“Not your fault,” she said, 
folding a flamboyant robe and 
laying it in her opened suitcase. 
“I’m going home.” 

“Nairobi?” 

“Where do you think I live? 
Beverly Hills?” 

“It’s already after five 
o’clock,” Kendy blurted. 

“If you think I’m worried 
about getting home through a 
little old border curfew — you’re 
right. But I’m going home.” 

Kendy picked up his suitcase. 

“No, you’re not. I’m going to 
find another room.” 

He descended to the ground 
floor, scowling. 

His suitcase felt as heavy as if

it were full of pre-Emergency 
bricks. The dorm cafeteria was 
closed and probably would not 
open before Monday. He could 
walk back along Childs Way to 
eat at the Commons. But he 
needed a place to hide his suit- 
case and noticed a downward 
slanting hall. 

He reached a basement door 
in semi-darkness. With an intui- 
tive movement, instinctive with 
great burglars, he reached up 
and slid his fingers along the 
ledge above the door. He found 
the key. 

A basement downstep toppled 
him forward, sent him staggering 
through a net of cobwebs. The 
place had not been used for a 
long time. The narrow beam of 
his tiny penlight slashed through 
a jungle of insulated pipes. In 
the middle of the concrete floor 
sat a bulky garbage disposal 
unit. It resembled a hippopota- 
mus with a lever to open its jaws. 
It sat on a sewer manhole. Above 
it, like an arboreal cobra, dan- 
gled a thick electric cord. Its 
three-fanged 220-volt head was 
not plugged in. 

He supposed this- dorm had 
been built soon after the Nation- 
al Emergency began — while 
there were still a lot of garbage 
strikes. The disposal looked big 
enough to swallow a man. 

He noticed a sink in the far 
corner. Above it was an empty 
light socket. Something moved 
in front of him like an ectoplas- 
mic flash as he groped forward. 
He winced. The movement was 



his reflection in a dusty mirror. 
He turned the tap. Water gur- 
gled. He remembered the story 
about the U.C.L.A. sophomore 
the Guardsman caught near 
some leaflets. The authorities 
had cancled his housing subsidy 
— and the student had hidden in 
a campus broom closet for the 
next three years, graduating 
with honors. 

II 

L ife was not easy, Kendy de- 
Icided after his first night on 
that concrete floor. Bleary-eyed, 
clutching his hip in pain, he 
wandered around the weekend 
campus. He was afraid that on 
Monday — if he went to the ad- 
ministrators to complain about the 
computer’s mismatch — someone 
would decide to investigate him. 

He discovered subversive ele- 
ments on this campus, as Mr. 
Smith had warned he would. Un- 
concealed in a flower bed near the 
National Guard Building lay a lit- 
tle handmade sign: LAWN OR- 
DER. Kendy tripped when he 
took a short cut through the hedge 
in the middle of University Boule- 
vard. His groping hand discovered 
a nearly invisible fishing leader 
strung tautly within the hedge. He 
glanced at the subwaylike entrance 
to the Congressional Research and 
Development Building — if he had 
been running away from there the 
line would have pitched him head- 
long. But it had been intended for 
pursuing Guardsmen. Students 
would know. Kendy frowned.

GALAXY 



He wanted to reconnoiter the 
building. He had acquired an F 
pass last night in the wooden shed 
where the maintenance men 
changed out of their white cover- 
alls. They had left them hanging 
there, complete with F passes. He 
had reached in, snagged one. 

He stood above the C.R.A.D. 
Building, the pass pinned to his 
shirt, but lost his nerve and wan- 
dered away along the boulevard 
toward Founders Hall. His lips 
moving, he stared at one of the 
three inscriptions on the modern 
base of the ancient, broken stone 
column. 

Hector and Paris saw me 
at Troy.

of Agamemnon.

Brushed me with her sleeve. 

His mouth twisted. His own Hel- 
en had been pale and dark-haired 
and was probably still working at 
National University’s biochem 
lab. 

To hell with you . 

He aimed his sudden rage and 
frustration at her but it curved 
back upon himself. He straight- 
ened, walked back to the entrance 
of the C.R.A.D. Building and down 
its iron steps. He pushed aside the 
glass door, caught a stale odor of 
cigar smoke. 

The Guardsman did not bother 
to look out from behind his news- 
paper. 

His voice drawled, “Hold it. 



Building’s closed. This is Satur- 
day.” 

“I forgot a book.” 

“Building’s closed on weekends 
and at night.” 

“I was sent to get an important 
book.” 

“Building’s closed unless you 
have a one-shot weekend pass 
from the Captain. Even then it’s 
closed to you, kid.” ^ 

The Guardsman made the last 
word sound like an insult. Janitors 
along the hall were shouting above 
the roar of a floor polishing ma- 
chine and Kendy raised his voice. 

“I have an F pass. And I need 
that book.” 

“The building’s closed.” 

Wispy smoke writhed above the 
newspaper. Kendy suspected that 
cigar smokers were even more 
stubborn than the surviving ciga- 
rette smokers. 

“Please, sir, if 1 — ” 

“You act like this building be- 
longs to you. You Goddamn stu- 
dent — get the hell out of here. And 
I’ll remember you — ” 

The Guardsman’s muffled voice 
pursued Kendy as he retreated up 
the iron stairway. He glanced back 
through the glass door. The 
Guardsman had tipped back his 
chair, had propped up both boots 
on his desk. He took up enough 
space to block the passage of any- 
one but an invisible man.

felt he could barely walk. He

GALAXY 



Smyert’s office was down in the 
Congressional Research and De- 
velopment Building. 

The coincidence was interesting. 
Having suffered through the inten- 
sive Russian course at National 
University, Kendy knew what the 
word smyert meant — and more. 
Dr. Magadan Smyert was the es- 
capee who had been E. Valilov’s 
teacher. Kendy began to feel ex- 
citement. Vavilov was the Soviet 
biochemist cosmonaut who failed 
to land on Mars. He had stopped 
on its moon, Phobos, and re- 
turned, reportedly in disgrace. 
Yet old Dr. Smyert was the one 
who had fled to the United States. 

K endy walked unchallenged 
past the Guardsman at the 
door and knew that Mr. Smith 
had arranged this meeting. 

Dr. Smyert peered up at him 
through rimless glasses. 

“KhtoT Whol 

Kendy tried out his Ukranian 
accent as he identified himself and 
the haggard man’s eyes widened. 
Dr. Smyert seized Kendy’s arm. 
He began to complain about his 
treatment here. 

Apparently, Dr. Smyert ex- 
pected him to serve as interpreter, 
errand boy and ghost writer for 
dull lesson plans. Dr. Smyert was 
supposed to be teaching Soviet lab 
procedures to four non-Russian- 
speaking undergraduate students. 
And he despised the task. He con- 
sidered teaching undergraduates 
an insult to his past biochemical 
prowess. 

“Pochemul" 



He iterated that his academic 
field was pure research and clung 
to Kendy’s arm. The door creaked 
and Dr. Smyert’s eyes widened. 
He whispered that he wished he 
were already safe at National Uni- 
versity. Here security was so weak 
that anyone could sneak down- 
stairs and murder him. 

When Kendy plodded back to 
his dorm he knew his tutorials 
with Dr. Smyert would be sheer 
misery. He had been a little sur- 
prised that a Russian escapee 
would be assigned an office in a 
restricted building. But maybe 
there was a reason for everything. 

He was heading for his base- 
ment hideout when a door banged 
in the dorm. He flinched. Exhaus- 
tion was making him a paranoiac. 
He wished himself invisible. 

No luck. 

“Hi,” a girl’s soft voice said be- 
hind him. “I haven’t seen you 
since Friday. I guess you had 
enough pull to get another room.” 

“Huh?” 

“Are you sick or something?” 
Amani’s voice leaped a little. 
“They told me to fill out a missing 
person form. They didn’t really 
listen to me. Like — maybe they’re 
going to take away my room.” 

“Don’t know — ” 

Wearily he became aware that 
two more Blacks were standing be- 
hind her. The man was scowling 
at him. The girl was the giggler, 
Charlene — giggling. 

Amani was telling him in sud- 
den anger, “Listen, listen — I stood 
all morning in that stinky line at 
their Administration Building. 



TOMORROW CUM LAUDE

When I got, to the head of the line 
they told me that if their comput- 
er matched us for the same room 
then that’s how it was going to be. 
If I didn’t like it I could drop out 
because there’s a long waiting list. 
They don’t want to understand.” 

Kendy was so tired he had dif- 
ficulty following her words. The 
whole conversation began to seem 
disjointed to him. 

“Who?” 

“How’d you,” Amani asked, 
“get your new room?” 

He said nothing, not wanting to 
admit where he had been sleeping. 

“You’d better,” the Black Man 
stated mysteriously and ominous- 
ly, “move your trash out of her 
room.” 

“He’s — ” Amani began. She 
changed course. “His stuff has 
never been in my room.” 

The giggler whooped, covering 
hor face. 

“I’m talking about his suit- 
case,” Amani said angrily. 

The giggler subsided. Her hand 
dropped, exposing teeth. Straight 
hair framed her lovely honey- 
brown face and contrasted with 
Amani’s stormy darkness. 

“These are my friends,” Amani 
said sharply to him. “Don is Char- 
lene’s roommate.” 

“The room is Amani’s,” the 
slender, conservatively dressed 
young Black stated, eyeing Kendy 
as if estimating his height and 
weight. “I hope you’re not think- 
ing of — ” 

“Don, he hasn’t tried to take 
my room,” Amani cut in. “I 
haven’t even seen him since Fri- 



day.” She laughed with embarrass- 
ment as sudden as her earlier an- 
ger. “Why don’t you two just 
shake hands and act friendly.” 

“All I meant was — ” Don 
glanced at Amani as he clamped 
down on Kendy’s hand. “If he — ” 
“He’s got a room,” Amani re- 
peated. “He’s got a better room 
assignment. What would he be do- 
ing around here if he didn’t have 
a room? Don, stop worrying about 
his taking my room. He’s already 
shown he’s got more influence 
than we have. He’s got a room. 
Where’s your room?” 

Kendy opened his mouth. 

“What I meant, was,” Don in- 
terrupted, dropping Kendy’s hand 
and rushing his voice at Amani, 
“if anyone bothers you, anybody 
at all, you just remember that 
Charlene and I are in the dorm 
across the street. You phone.” He 
stepped closer to Amani. “I’ll 
come.” 

“We’re your friends, honey,” 
Charlene drawled. 

“Fine friends,” Amani flared at 
her. “Didn’t you hear you-know- 
who was transferring to Caj^Tech? 
Why didn’t you tell me he’s left 
me the only Black Woman in this 
tower?” 

“We hadn’t heard,” Don pro- 
tested. “I didn’t know till yester- 
day when Charlene told me.” 
“Honey, I didn’t know,” Char- 
lene squeaked. “By the time I 
knew — I thought those stupid ad- 
ministrators had found someone 
else for you. I didn’t think their 
machine would make mistakes 
like this.” 



18 



GALAXY 



She glanced at Kendy and again 
her fingers screened her face. She 
giggled. 

Abruptly Amani turned her 
back to both of them. 

“Amani,” Don was pleading. “I 
don’t believe in giving advice to 
people. But you know the admini- 
strators won’t let you keep that 
whole room for yourself. Every- 
body else in your dorm’s already 
matched by now, so they'll just as- 
sign any old honk — well, anybody 
who registers late — to your room, 
no matter what his compatibility 
profile is.” 

“Honey, we think you should 
go home,” Charlene giggled. 

"TaJadhalV." Amani exclaimed, 
whirling at her. “Let me run my 
own life.” She scowled at Kendy. 
“What administrator did you see 
to get your room assignment 
changed?” 

“Didn’t,” he muttered. “I been 
sleeping in the — in a rec room.” 

Charlene emitted a whoop. 

“I don’t want any more of your 
noise,” Amani said. 

Charlene seized Don’s arm. 

“Let’s go,” she said firmly, al- 
most dragging her man out of the 
building. 

“I didn’t mean to put you in an 
embarrassing situation,” Kendy 
muttered to Amani. “I’ll go to the 
administrators if you — ” 

“I couldn’t be any more embar- 
rassed and humiliated than I al- 
ready am. I don’t mean by you — 
I just feel so angry at everybody.” 
Her voice rose. “Tomorrow you go 
to the administrators. Where’s 
your suitcase!” 



“In the — none of your biz.” He 
laughed groggily. “I been sleeping 
on a concrete floor.” 

“What rec room is that?” she 
asked with suspicion. “The ones 
I’ve seen are carpeted. You’re put- 
ting me on.” 

“Too sleepy,” he muttered. 
“Can’t even lie straight.” 

“Very funny — but I’m not 
laughing.” 

O PENING Room 943, she 
pointed at the blue line in the 
checkerboard linoleum. “Over 
there is your half. We’ll straighten 
out the rest tomorrow morning.” 
Kendy was feeling happier. 
“Little problem tonight. Bath- 
room’s in your half.” 

“Do tell? Well, I’ll give you 
this square here — and that square 
— and you can get there in two 
jumps. What’s your major.” 

“Don’t shoot. I thought it was 
biochemistry.” He sighed, feeling 
dizzy again. “But that’s not why 
I’m so hung over. Pardon me if I 
lie down on my bed. I’ve been 
sleeping on — ” 

“A concrete floor? I’ll bet? 
Aren’t you going to go look for 
your-suitcase? Or is it pawned?” 
“Tell me your major instead.” 
“Elementary Education with 
minors in Art and Creative Dance. 
If you’ll excuse me now — I have 
a date.” 

“Thanks,” he mumbled, his 
eyes closing again. 

When he awoke the room was 
dark and empty. 

He went down to the dorm 
cafeteria too late and had to hike 



TOMORROW CUM LAUDE

along Childs Way to Commons to 
get anything to eat. Later he wan- 
dered around the night campus, 
procrastinating. He found himself 
drawn to the Congressional- Re- 
search and Development Build- 
ing. At this hour the only ones go- 
ing down were maintenance men 
in their white coveralls. All of 
them seemed to be Black. He 
wondered why he was so nervous. 
When he finally went back to the 
dorm the room was dark. 

Amani seemed asleep. 

He changed hurriedly — in the 
bathroom — into his basketball 
warm-up suit, although at Nation- 



al U. he had slept in his jockey 
shorts. He slipped between the 
sheets of his bed and became 
wide awake. Pipes gurgled. Ele- 
vators hummed. People laughed 
in the hall. Doors closed. Toilets 
flushed. He had to go to the bath- 
room and was not amused.

cool, except the Student Repre- 
sentative of the National Guard, 
who did a double-take and scur- 
ried away to telephone. Amani 
did not seem to notice. And he 
began to realize that she was more 
relaxed and secure within herself 
than any girl he had known. 

“Please pass the chumvi," she 
whispered mischievously and he 
learned his second word of Swa- 
hili, salt. The first word had been 
Amani. She explained; “I was only 
eight when I named myself. 
That’s one nice thing about Nairo- 
bi. You’re free to choose your 
own name when you have your 



eighth birthday. When I was a 
little girl — right after we were at- 
tacked by your National Emer- 
gency — I guess all I wanted was 
peace. So that’s what I named my- 
self, peace.” Amani smiled, her 
teeth flashing. “I’m not so peace- 
ful now.” 

In the afternoon — as he walked 
toward the entrance to ‘the Con- 
gressional Research and Develop- 
ment Building, dreading his next 
“tutorial” with Dr. Smyert — a 
lean National Guardsman joined 
him stride for stride. 

“You’re Dorm A-two, room 
nine-four-three-B, aren’t you?” 



TOMO RROWCUAALAUDE 



21 




The voice was soft and trying 
to be pleasant. 

Kendy forced a smile. 

“That’s right.” 

“I’m Captain of the Guard 
here.” The bony face seemed al- 
most as old and weary as a full- 
professor’s. “I wonder if I might 
look at your registration card.” 

“Be my guest.” 

Kendy watched the other peer 
into the lens of the card and felt 
numb. 

But the captain smiled in recog- 
nition. 

“Preempt Prep. Glad to meet 
you, Ken. My student assistant 
last semester was from the same 
school. So you know him.” 

Was the captain playing games? 
Mr. Smith had been infiltrating 
students to U.S.C. for several 
years. Like Kendy, they had been 
given counterfeit academic rec- 
ords from that nonexistent prep 
school. Like Kendy, they were 
really from National U. They had 
been sent to test U.S.C.’s security, 
to test the National Guard. 

The captain was chatting cheer- 
fully: “I wondered how you hap- 
pened to get such an — inappropri- 
ate compatibility assignment in 
Dorm A-two. But I realize it must 
be a computer error and no re- 
flection on your political back- 
ground. Errors like this cause 
unrest. They’re what I try to pre- 
vent or correct. I’ll go with you to 
Administration and help you get 
assigned to a different room- 
mate.” 

“I’m happy with what I’ve — ” 

Kendy caught himself. He 



shivered — but not from fear. He 
wanted to hit this bone-faced 
man. 

“Maybe you’re right,” the 
captain said thoughtfully. “They 
do a job on you kids at Preempt 
Prep. Not doing anything may be 
safest in this case. If I corrected 
your room-mate assignment now, 
certain trouble-makers might mis- 
take my motives as prejudice. 
Maybe there’s a reason for the 
computer error.” The captain 
winked. “At least you’ll be in a 
position to note who her friends 
and contacts are. So keep in touch 
with me. And maybe I can help 
you some time.” 

Kendy could not speak. His 
face contorted in a toothy grim- 
ace. Evidently the captain 
thought it a smile. He grinned 
at Kendy, turned and left. 

K endy was stlll on the re- 
bound when he reached the 
C.R.A.D. Building. He tried to 
keep from exploding at Dr. Smy- 
ert. The lonely old Ukranian kept 
regurgitating his life story. Kendy 
managed to last him out and later 
wandered into the hall. 

He prowled until he thought he 
knew where the ultra-centrifuge 
was kept. He saw an outer room 
that contained several humming 
centrifuges no larger than basket- 
balls inset in washing machines. 
An inner room was kept locked — 
faculty members with keys used 
them, entering and leaving. 

The last departing graduate 
student locked the door of the 
outer room. But the maintenance

GALAXY 



men, arriving with their push- 
carts and brooms, unlocked all the 
doors along the hall. 

Kendy waited for his chance. 
He walked into the outer room 
and noted the make of lock on the 
inner door. He hurried out, not 
wanting to be trapped if someone 
closed the outer door. He met a 
Guardsman ambling along the 
hall, shooing the last students out 
of the building. 

“Time to go home. Building’s 
closed.” 

The next day Kendy tried to 
stay late. A Guardsman discovered 
him crouched under Dr. Smyert’s 
desk. 

“Don’t let me catch you in here 
after hours again, kid,” the 
Guardsman said. “I should report 
you to the Captain.” 

Kendy realized that only 
Guardsmen and maintenance 
Blacks enter and leave the build- 
ing at night. 

He bought six locks of the same 
make as the inner door’s. In his 
basement hideaway he practiced 
with his little burglar pick and L- 
shaped tension bar. Inserting the 
pick, he released the tumbler pins 
and tried to hold them up with 
his tension bar. He discovered he 
needed three hands and more pa- 
tience. 

Late that night Amani teased 
him as he came in. 

“How’s your girl friend?” 

“You’re my only friend.” 

“Not that kind .of friend, 
whitey-whitey-white boy.” 

Amani laughed and walked into 
the bathroom to change for bed. 



“Guess what,” he called. “Dr. 
Smyert requisitioned a desk for 
me today — like I’m a grad stu- 
dent. My own desk. I filled out 
the form and he signed it. He 
didn’t believe they’d really let 
him have it. He’s always com- 
plaining how miserly the adminis- 
tration is. I guess he hates our 
bureaucrats as much as the ones 
he ran from.” 

“Good for him.” 

“He’s a misanthrope.” 

“What?” She was rustling the 
shower curtains. 

“Picture an old Ukranian bio- 
chemist so bitter he renames him- 
self smyert. That’s the Russian 
word for death.” 

The shower roared, stopped. 
Amani came out in an immensely 
concealing housecoat. Her arms 
darted from huge sleeves and she 
began to rub her head with a tow- 
el. 

“Amani, the really important 
thing about Dr. Smyert is that he 
knows E. Vavilov. He was Vavi- 
lov’s teacher.” 

“Ooh, my hair’s wilted. Why 
don’t you invent a waterproof 
hairspray.” 

“Don’t you ever pay any atten- 
tion to what’s going on in the 
world? E. Vavilov was trained to 
become the first biochemist to set 
foot on Mars. For some reason he 
decided not to land there.” 

“Maintaining a natural hairdo 
can get damned difficult.” 

“Instead of descending from 
Phobos in the landing module. 
Vavilov stayed fussing around on 
that little moon as if he’d dis- 



TOMO R ROW C UM LAU DE

covered something more impor- 
tant than Mars. Didn’t you pay 
attention to the space coverage?” 

“More likely I was taking a 
dancing lesson or doing something 
else meaningful to me.” Amani 
laughed. “Seems like all my life 
teevee has been counting down 
and blasting off. In Nairobi, at 
least, we don’t waste money that 
way. But lecture me if it makes 
you feel superior.” 

“The telepics showed him 
crawling around on Phobos in his 
shiny suit. I suppose you know 
Phobos is the Greek word for fear. 
Did I say it’s Mars’ inner moon? 
Very small. But it looked enor- 
mous. Their little ship attached it- 
self as planned. E. Vavilov was 
supposed to crawl into the landing 
module and separate himself and 
land on Mars — but he didn’t. He 
embarrassed the Soviet P.R. 
men.” 

“Am I supposed to ask why?” 

“The ship returned to some- 
place like Engelsistan. E. Vavilov 
seemed to be in disgrace and was 
kept incommunicado. His military 
pilot read from a prepared state- 
ment. Officially a minor technical 
difficulty prevented the Mars 
landing. But Dr. Smyert thinks 
they brought something back 
from Phobos. And lately the Rus- 
sians have begun frantically 
searching our Moon. Maybe 
they’ve discovered the same thing 
there?” 

“Am I supposed to ask what? 
All right. An Easter egg?” She 
laughed. “Or a Chinese cosmo- 
naut?” 



“Seriously, Dr. Smyert says he 
doesn’t know what’s under the 
dome they inflated on our Moon. 
He claims the Party started perse- 
cuting him because he was E. Va- 
vilov’s teacher. Anyway, Moscow 
canceled Dr. Smyert’s research 
grant. They demoted him to 
teaching lab procedures in some 
Ukranian technical school. What 
really bugs him: he was demoted 
but now they’ve permitted E. Va- 
vilov to return to the research in- 
stitute on Lake Baikal.” Kendy 
frowned. “Sometimes I think the 
real rea.son they sent Dr. Smyert 
away from his Lake Baikal insti- 
tute and took away his grant was 
because he’s gotten old. Some- 
times he seems confused. He con- 
tradicts himself. The man I’d like 
to meet is Vavilov. I want to ask 
him what happened.” 

“That would be a little diffi- 
cult,” she said. “Russia?” 

H arder than visiting Nairo- 
bi?” 

“We wouldn’t let you through 
the barricades.” 

“I’ve got a bottle of Passbiack.” 
He laughed. “Ed only walk in a 
little way, holding your hand.” 

“1 think you’re studying to be 
either a provocateur or a honk 
vigilante spy. You? My room- 
mate? Even if our Security Patrol 
rescued you from a lamppost we’d 
still hold you for the next prisoner 
exchange. Nairobi’s where you’re 
not going.” . 

“Just trying to learn,” he said, 
“about my country.” 

“Yours? There’s no room for 



24 



GALAXY 



you in Nairobi,” she said, “and 
for me Nairobi is a cop-out. For 
me its Nairobiclaustrophobia. I’ve 
come out to enjoy the rest of my 
country.” 

She sat down in front of her 
mirror, unwinding the towel from 
her hair. 

“Have you told your mother 
about me?” 

“You kidding? She thinks I’m 
in an all-girls dorm.” 

Her gaze dropped and her 
quick hands laid out a row of 
straight clamps on her dressing 
table. 

He wanted to say — something. 

“My mother was what they 
used to call — a hippy,” he blurt- 
ed. “So I’ve tried to be the oppo- 
site. What’s that big squeeze-bot- 
tle of gunk?” 

“None of your business.” 

She opened a drawer. He 
watched the bending column of 
her neck. Rising again, the dark 
cloud of her natural floated high 
above the bright red collar of her 
housecoat. 

Not only did she persist in con- 
cealing herself in that flamboyant 
tent, he thought with poignancy, 
she slept in an immense cotton 
Kanga that hid her in a quivering 
of printed blossoms. He had never 
had a good tom-peep at her, al- 
though her various pink bras, 
white bras, black bras festooned 
the drying line over the tub and 
interfered with his right elbow 
when he was shaving. 

She had beautiful hands, much 
smaller than his. His first pair of 
cotton gloves had been too small 



for him. He had soaked them in 
the bathroom and tried to stretch 
them — they had shrunk instead. 
Amani had seized them for her* 
own because another weird course 
she was taking was Woodworking. 
She would not tell him why. And 
he could not tell her he had 
bought the gloves in order not to 
leave fingerprints in the C.R.A.D. 
Building. 

She always tried to dress in the 
bathroom. Or she changed inside 
her Kanga. The garment was as 
voluminous as a mu-mu. Some- 
times she would flow out of it in 
black leotards. 

She would stretch and bend 
sinuously on her side of the room, 
practicing her dancing. She 
whirled and leaped when he 
teased her. She could land with- 
out a sound and, without crossing 
the blue line on the linoleum, 
tower above him on tiptoes, her 
hair quivering like a magic bee- 
swarm. 

N OW she fidgeted indecisively 
at her dressing table. She 
would never resemble one of 
those golden ads for Cleopatra 
suntan lotion, he thought. She 
looked as she should — like herself. 
He wanted to say as much and to 
tell her what he was feeling. But 
he was afraid she would laugh 
and reject him. He watched her 
hand rise to her hair again. Her 
eyes were looking at him from the 
mirror and he grinned with em- 
barrassment. 

“What,” he blurted, “are you 
doing with all that junk?”

“There are times when a girl 
needs a little privacy.” Her reflec- 
tion smiled at him. “Hint-hint.” 
“Okay,” he said awkwardly. “I 
was going out anyway.” 

He had planned to stay. He had 
been postponing his attempt to 
violate the security of the Con- 
gressional Research and Develop- 
ment Building. His life had be- 
come strangely, exotically beauti- 
ful when he was near Amani arid 
he had found himself reluctant to 
risk being caught and spoiling 
their relationship. He guessed 
spies should not fall in love. May- 
be the best thing was . to get his 
task over with. Try to write off 
Amani’s sorcery. He had figured 
out a way to become an invisible 
man on this campus. 

He went down to his basement, 
relocked the door behind him and 
groped to the sink. Reaching up, 
he turned on his light bulb and 
blinked into the dusty mirror. He 
reached under the sink and took 
out the rolled-up white coveralls. 

They drooped on his lanky 
frame. The janitor who had 
thrown them away must have 
been both tall and fat. Kendy was 
merely tall and nervous. 

He rubbed Passblack on his 
cheeks and saw his identity dis- 
solve in the mirror. He tried a 
smile, found himself expressing 
fright. He pulled on new white 
cotton workgloves, a larger size. 
The others had been too small. 
These were too large. 

He stuffed a rag into the sag- 
ging pocket of his coveralls to hold 
down his minicamera. He did not 



want it bouncing out if he had to 
run. He looked at the disposal. 

He hoped it would be able to 
grind up his stolen plastic toolbox. 
The box held an electric repair 
kit, fuses, pliers, tape, pencil and 
requisition forms in triplicate. He 
had decided on the identity of an 
electrical repairman complete 
with toolbox and signed work or- 
der. Wondering if he had forgot- 
ten anything, he pinned the F 
pass on his coveralls. 

His worries increased as he 
walked along Childs Way, bright- 
ly illuminated by “emergency” 
lights. He changed his mind and 
circled north, finally reaching 
University Boulevard near Found- 
ers Hall. By now he was breathing 
too hard, beginning to sweat — he 
could rouse suspicion. He paused 
beside the broken marble column 
to calm down. 

He kneeled to read the inscrip- 
tion at the base of the column. 

Ye parent gods! who rule 
the fate of Troy. 

Still dwells the Dardan spirit 
in the boy; 

When minds, like these, in 
striplings thus ye raise; 

Yours is the godlike act, be 
yours the praise. 

The poem made him feel un- 
comfortable. The broad buildings 
loomed around him, thousands of 
lighted windows glaring from 
emptied classrooms, awaiting the 
janitors. He pulled the bill of his 
janitor’s cap lower over his eyes. 
The C.R.A.D. Building nearby

breathed warmth up its stairway 
against his face as if he were en- 
tering the jaws of a dragon. He 
clumped down the iron steps, 
pushed open the glass door. The 
stench of dead cigar smoke wrin- 
kled his nose. He glanced toward 
the desk. The Guardsman there 
seemed asleep under the newspa- 
per spread like a shroud over his 
face. 

But the newspaper rustled as 
Kendy walked past the desk. He 
continued down the hall, ambled 
past Dr. Smyert’s office. He heard 
the clunk of a wastebasket being 
emptied. But he saw no one in the 
hall and managed to slip into the 
room he had scouted earlier. 

He thrust his burglar’s pick into 
the lock of the inner door. His 
hands were shaking. He dropped 
the tension bar. It took him nearly 
fifteen minutes to turn the lock. 

The narrow beam from his pen- 
light showed him so little of the 
inner room at any one time that 
he was unable to visualize it as a 
whole. He hoped he would recog- 
nize the centrifuge. 

IV 

H e heard a click ahead of him 
and switched off the pen- 
light. He stood in darkness, listen- 
ing, doubting whatever he was 
doing here. 

If he were caught and convicted, 
Mr. Smith had assured him, he 
would never land in the Federal 
Penitentiary. To show that he had 
been testing security for another 
government agency would present 



no problem. But a revelation of 
his activities could end his useful- 
ness as an agent. 

No further sound came from 
the darkness around him. He 
again turned on the penlight, saw 
disordered shapes and shadows. 
He found it difficult to orient him- 
self both physically and spiritual- 
ly. His early indoctrination had 
become diluted by what he felt for 
Amani and by exposure to a more 
multifaceted existence than the 
one he had known at National 
University. 

Yesterday Amani had needled 
him about his being white. Whites 
were insistent on the continuation 
of the National Emergency. He 
had argued weakly that the Emer- 
gency still was only a temporary 
measure. 

Temporary for you, permanent 
for us. But you white innocents 
are prisoners, too . 

He put her out of his mind and 
tried to concentrate. The room 
seemed so cluttered with equip- 
ment that he was afraid he would 
photograph the wrong centrifuge. 
A row of them gleamed along one 
wall, one-eyed and silent. 

His penlight beam found an im- 
perfectly closed vacuum-seal lid 
in the floor and under it a round 
pit. He smiled with excitement. In 
the pit was a planetoid shape — it 
had to be the rotor of the centri- 
fuge. It was big. He had never 
imagined a titanium rotor of this 
diameter. He did not see how it 
could endure the centrifugal stress 
from the rumored hundred and 
fifty thousand revolutions per 



TOMORROW CUM LAUDE

minute. The enclosing pit was 
probably insurance in case it 
burst. 

He took out his minicamera. It 
was a hard little world, he thought. 
Biochemistry had become impor- 
tant to the Defense Department. 
Necessarily they were trying to 
overtake the Russians. There were 
many military applications for 
biological centrifuges. He ad- 
justed the microflash on the cam- 
era, assuring himself that he was 
a good guy, a counterspy helping 
to defend his country, his tribe. 
What he defended might not be 
perfect but it was his. His life was 
part of his tribe’s. To think other- 
wise was to consider self-destruc- 
tion. 

Sometimes, in moments of un- 
happiness, he had daydreamed of 
taking action to improve his tribe. 
He would change it from within. 
But it seemed ready to burst apart. 
To think of changing it beyond 
recognition seemed as frightening 
as lobotomizing himself. 

Clumsily his fingers operated 
the gadgets on his camera. The 
microflash blinked. He took an- 
other picture. 

Curiosity overcame him. He 
dropped into the pit to examine 
the rotor. It was shaped like a 
double boiler. He unbolted and 
raised its upper hemisphere. The 
hinge creaked. 

Instead of being divided into 
four pie-slice compartments like 
the zonal rotor he had used in the 
lab at National University, the 
interior of this giant was divided 
into eight sectors. It would whirl 



\ 

\ 



with tremendous centrifugal 
force. He noticed alternate sectors 
were designed to r-emain empty of 
fluid in order to minimize weight 
and structural strain. Its very long 
radius provided a long gradient. 
The contents of ruptured human 
cells would be spread a long way 



GALAXY 



TOMORROW CUM LAUDE 



through the sucrose gradient. He 
supposed the different organic 
molecules would be separated 
from each other more effectively 
in this big rotor. 

The laminated edges made him 
think the metal was not titanium. 
It seemed to be a composite — per- 



haps a metal-epoxy sandjvich, 
light and strong. He guessed its 
basic technology was another spin- 
off from jet-engine rotor-compres- 
sor research. 

He shrugged, feeling slightly 
disappointed and wondering what 
all the secrecy was about. He saw 



no breakthrough in centrifuge de- 
sign here. He closed the upper 
hemisphere. It was simply a big 
zonal rotor whose outer edge 
could spin more forcefully. It of- 
fered molecular biologists and 
their mixed-up molecules a little 
more centrifugal separation. 

He locked the inner door behind 
him, peered down the hall. Dis- 
tance diminished the Guardsman 
— he seemed of no consequence. 
The newspaper was spread like a 
privacy screen. 

Sleep, sleep, sleep. 

T he odor of cigars was stale. 

Dead. The limp newspaper 
shrouded the face and chest. The 
boots were propped up on the 
desk. Their leather soles con- 
fronted Kendy. They waggled 
sleepily, rested their heads togeth- 
er. They made him think of an odd 
little couple from another planet, 
alike in shape but mirror images 
of each other. They waggled again 
as if soundlessly communicating 
with each other as he tiptoed past. 
• “What you stealing, boy?” 

Kendy stopped. The glass door 
ahead seemed so near. He could 
see that its magnetically-activated 
bolt was open. The newspaper 
rustled. 

“Boy, why don’t you answer me 
whert I speak to you?” 

Kendy swallowed. He imagined 
the Guardsman’s finger reaching 
toward the door-locking button on 
his desk. Kendy forced a foolish 
grin and held open his hinged 
plastic toolbox for inspection. Like 
a loose tooth, a screwdriver 



dropped to the floor. He bent to 
pick it up and more tools spilled 
from his box. He scrambled to re- 
trieve them, playing the fool, leav- 
ing until last the ones which had 
rolled toward the door. He crawled 
toward them, clumsily picking 
them up one by one. 

The Man laughed. 

With an inward sigh of relief, 
Kendy snapped his box shut. He 
rose, one step from the door. 

“Where you going, boy?” 

Kendy’s feet felt glued down 
while his body swayed toward the 
door. 

“Come over here, boy. That 
bulge in your pocket ain’t your 
snotrag.” 

Kendy turned his head. He 
was frightened and unaccustomed 
to being addressed in this tone of 
voice. The man’s face remained 
concealed behind his newspaper. 

“Come here, boy.” 

Kendy’s knuckles hardened 
around the handle of the toolbox. 
The door still seemed near. He 
imagined the Guardsman’s yellow- 
stained finger hovering above the 
lock button. 

“You hear me, boy? Show me 
what you stole.” The man’s finger 
would be descending on the but- 
ton. “You hear me?” 

Kendy hurled the toolbox. It hit 
the newspaper with a solid thunk. 
Both boot soles rose from the desk, 
up and over as the chair tipped 
over. 

Kendy fled. 

He bounded up the stairs and 
knew he was being pursued. His 
foot missed the curb. He fell flat 



30 



GALAXY 



on the pavement and sprang up. 
As he hurdled the hedge dividing 
University Boulevard he heard 
the Guardsman’s voice. 

“I’ll shoot—” 

Kendy ran. He heard a crash 
and knew the Guardsman had 
reached the hedge and tripped 
over the transparent fishline. A 
shot came, a yelp of pain. Ken- 
dy hunched his shoulders and ac- 
celerated. He had not believed 
anyone would really shoot. He 
dodged like a rabbit, expecting 
another bullet and aware that the 
angry yells behind him were be- 
coming fainter and more distant. 

Kendy made a skidding turn 
past Tommy Trojan and sprinted 
along Childs Way. He lost his cap. 
He could hear distant shouts con- 
verging as he dashed into his 
dorm. 

Other Guardsmen had taken up 
the pursuit. He darted through 
the entry hall, past the mail slot 
and the elevators. He popped into 
his basement like a rabbit into its 
hole. 

He collapsed on the concrete 
floor, tried to listen for Guards- 
men’s footsteps. He heard nothing 
and sighed with relief. 

Removing the film cassette 
from his camera, he sealed it in 
the prepared mailer. 

H e stared at his dark face 
in the mirror. It seemed to be 
accusing him of something. He 
seized the white bottle, poured 
neutralizer over wadded cotton. 
His cheeks stung as he rubbed off 
the Passblack. 



He was amazingly pale. Fish- 
belly white. 

He stepped out of his coveralls, 
kicked them toward the disposal. 
He pressed its lever. Its lid 
opened, revealing rusty teeth. He 
dropped in his camera, the cover- 
alls, the bottles of Passblack and 
neutralizer, the stained cotton, the 
cotton gloves. He twisted the fau- 
cet handle. Water roared into the 
iron hippopotamus. He grabbed 
the thick wire and plugged it into 
the disposal’s electric motor. 

A grinding, crunching, terrify- 
ing sound rose. He thought it 
might awaken the whole dorm 
and unplugged the machine. He 
looked in. The evidence had 
vanished. 

Feeling safer in his own clothing 
and holding the incriminating 
film, he walked into the entry hall. 
A Guardsman approached him. 
Kendy reached the mail slot, 
leaned against the wall and unob- 
trusively inserted the mailer. 

He pushed away from the wall 
and started toward the elevator. 
The Guardsman followed him, 
stood waiting silently until the 
elevator came. 

The Guardsman nodded, waited 
for Kendy to enter. 

Kendy pressed the button for his 
floor. The Guardsman said noth- 
ing. When the elevator opened, 
Kendy let the Guardsman precede 
him. The latter strode directly to 
the door of Room 943. Kendy 
heard Amani’s protesting voice 
as the Guardsman entered. He 
glimpsed two others in the corner 
of the room. 



TOMORROW CUM LAUDE

He stood in the elevator, his 
eyes blurring. 

Amani’s voice cried, “I tell you 
I don’t have any coveralls.” 

A Guardsman pulled open a 
drawer of her dressing table. An- 
other — Kendy recognized the cap- 
tain — moved to stand between her 
and the doorway. Kendy stepped 
carefully out of the elevator. 

“We have witnesses,” the cap- 
tain was saying to her. “You’re 
the only Black in this building. 
All we had to do was look in the 
registration file downstairs and 
find your room number. Let me 
see your card. A Guardsman saw 
you run into this building.” 

“Witnesses to what? To what?” 
Amani cried in outrage. 

“You don’t match your pic- 
' ture,” the captain’s voice stated 
as he peered into her translucent 
Registration Card. He glanced up 
at her face. “Trying to disguise 
yourself?” 

“No! Are you crazy?” She 
seemed somehow shorter, shrunk- 
en, and Kendy realized her mag- 
nificent natural was gone. 

She had plastered her hair down 
with straighteners and gunk. She 
] had also cut it like Charlene’s. In- 
stead of her robe, she was wearing 
a straight knit dress. Her dark face 
trembled on the verge of tears. “I 
just tried to change my hair-do. 
I’m still the same. What are you 
talking about?” 

“We have the cap,” the captain 
said, holding up the cap Kendy 
had lost. “You hid your shortened 
hair in order to look even more 
like a Janitor. This cap fell off 



while you were running. See, it fits 
your head. You’re not the first 
Black girl who — ” 

Kendy shoved past the captain 
into the room. 

“Let me into my own room.” 

“I know you.” The captain 
smiled and extended a bony hand. 
“I just realized this is your room. 
You’ve been living with trouble. 
Without knowing it, I hope.” 
-“Kendy. Kosa — mistake!” Then 
Amani cried, “I didn’t do any- 
thing.” Kendy nodded at the cap- 
tain. 

That’s right. She didn’t.” 

“Do what?” challenged the cap- 
tain, staring at him. 

Kendy smiled nervously. He 
wished he’d kept his mouth shut. 

Amani yelled, backing away 
from the squatter Guardsman, 
"Don’t you touch me — ” 

“She hasn’t done anything — ” 
Kendy shouted. 

“Son, you don’t know what 
she’s done,” the captain said. 
“We found her gloves in the bath- 
room. So we know she tried to 
sneak into the C.R.A.D. Building. 
She was wearing gloves then. 
When we find the coverall part of 
her disguise, we won’t bother you 
any more.” 

“She didn’t do it,” Kendy 
bleated, almost confessing. 
“Those aren’t her gloves.” 

“Then whose are they?” 

“Mine.” 

“See they’re too small for your 
hands. I understand your pur- 
pose,” the captain said. “You feel 
you ought to defend your room- 
mate-even though you don’t 



32 



GALAXY 



know what she has done.” He 
rested his hand on Kendy’s arm. 
“You should have a higher loyal- 
ty. As I recall, the motto of 
preempt Prep is Loyalty — mean- 
ing nothing small. Last year when 
he was my student assistant. 
Chuck gave me one of your blue- 
and-gold banners. You must have 
been a friend of his. I can’t be- 
lieve you’re involved in this im- 
moral — business.” 

“This what?” Amani’s voice 
cried in outrage. 

The captain laughed. 

“All right. You tell me why 
you’ve been sneaking into the 
C.R.A.D. Building at night.” 

“I never have — ” 

The captain glanced from 
Amani to Kendy. “Do you realize 
that one of our Guardsmen has 
been seriously injured?” 

Kendy insisted thickly, “She — 
she didn’t do anything.” 



T he captain said gravely, “I 
admire your attitude toward a 
roommate — but you could be 
starting to obstruct officers of — ” 
Amani grabbed the phone, 
yelled, “Help!” 

A Guardsman seized her arm. 
The captain whirled. He extended 
his fountain pen toward her face. 
There was a hiss. He turned his 
helmeted head away. His trans- 
parent visor had dropped over his 
face. 



the captain’s foot shoved in front 
of him. 

“It’s a harmless gas, medically 
approved.” The captain’s free 
hand opened, fingers spread like a 
tattered white flag of peace. “Son, 
if you understood our problems 
you’d support us in this investiga- 
tion. The fact she is Black has 
nothing to — ” 

“Get out of our room,” Kendy 
wheezed. 

It was difficult for him to 
breathe. All three Guardsmen 
were masked by visor filters. 

“ — has nothing to do with this 
arrest — except that her color 
helped us to identify her,” the 
captain was saying as if from a 
great distance. “If you weren’t an 
alumnus of Preempt Prep I might 
have doubts about you, the way 
you’re interfering here. 1 could or- 
der you detained for interroga- 
tion, polygraphic questioning. Af- 
ter ten years in command. I’ve 
learned how dangerous it is to 
trust students.” 

“You trigot,” Kendy gasped in 
campus jargon, labeling the cap- 
tain as prejudiced against white 
students as well as Black. “Listen 
I did it”’ 

“You must be abnormally sen- 
sitive to cannibogen gas,” the 
captain murmured. “Don’t panic. 
It will wear off in a few minutes. 
Step out into the hall. Now 
breathe deeply. We’ll take her to 
the ambulance so that the

Kendy yelled wordlessly at the “I did it,” Kendy repeated, fol- 
captain and collided with a chair^owing them. Each slow move-

ment of his legs felt a mile long. 
“I did it — ” ' 

He laughed in confusion. 

“Try to restrain yourself,” the 
captain said disgustedly. “The 
gas will wear off. You’re under- 
going a reversal reaction — a 
harmless side-effect. Try to re- 
strain any irrationally guilty feel- 
ings. They won’t last.” 

“But I did do what you’re ac- 
cusing Amani — ” 

“At the moment you’d confess 
to anything.” The captain 
laughed. “Fight it.' It’s merely 
chemical arousal of your early 
childhood guilt experiences. It 
spreads upward in time. Proba- 
bly by now you’re even feeling 
guilty because Blacks exist. But 
don’t get noisily masochistic or 
we’ll suspect you have liberal 
tendencies.” 

“But — I — did — it,” Kendy re- 
peated. “I — did — ” 

“Be quiet,” the captain said. 
“You’re disturbing serious stu- 
dents.” 

Kendy blinked at the concern- 
ed faces in the doorway along 
the hall. 

The captain’s voice said loudly, 
“You’re both detained. This is a 
marijuana investigation. Why 
I can smell it!” 

Pale faces vanished from the 
doorways. 

V 

T he elevator dropped. Kendy’s 
blurred gaze shifted from the 
captain’s face to Amani’s. 



She smiled as if intoxicated. 

“Want to go home?” she asked. 

“I did it,” Kendy repeated to 
the captain, who shrugged and 
glanced at Amani. 

“I believe you.” Amani 
laughed bitterly. “I understand 
you. I understand too much,” she 
yelled with explosive rage. “I 
hate, I hate, I hate you!” 

She wasn’t looking at the cap- 
tain. 

“It will wear off,” the captain 
muttered to Kendy and tried hus- 
tling her out of the elevator. 

The campus seemed bright with 
riot lights. The sidewalk was emp- 
ty except for a Guardsman lean- 
ing against the armored car and 
idly stroking his stubby automatic 
shotgun. Above him the turret of 
the armored car aimed its three 
nozzles and its two open-mouthed 
but silent loudspeakers toward the 
dorm. Someone coughed. The tur- 
ret swiveled suspiciously. 

The captain guided Amani to 
the rear of the ambulance. Her 
body was swaying. Kendy looked 
into the ambulance and saw a 
Guardsman lying on a stretcher. 
He was clenching a dead cigar be- 
tween his teeth and looked as if he 
were suffering more from anger 
than pain. A bandage around his 
foot was dark with blood. 

“Recognize her?” asked the 
captain. 

“Her?” 

The injured Guardsman sat up 
in surprise. 

“You said she was wearing 
coveralls,” the captain reminded 
him. “And a janitor’s cap. Here’s 



34 



GALAXY 



the cap.” The captain gingerly 
placed the white cap on Amani’s 
bent head. “Now you identify 
her? She was wearing the gloves.” 
“Her?” The Guardsman’s eyes 
widened and his cigar wobbled. 
“His — her coveralls was too big, 
baggy, but—” 

“Then you do identify her?” 

“My foot’s killing me,” the 
Guard mumbled evasively, sink- 
ing back. 

“We’ll detain her for a poly- 
graph,” the captain stated. “Now 
that you’ve made a tentative iden- 
tification — ” 

“Are you blind?” Kendy ex- 
claimed, leaning in at the Guards- 
man. “Look at me. Don’t you rec- 
ognize me?” 

The Guardsman glanced from 
Kendy’s face to the captain’s. 

“I told you it was a Black boy 
— not a — ” 

Kendy shouted, “I was wearing 
Passblack, you bigoted idiot — ” 
“I’m not all that stupid,” the 
Guardsman retorted, closing his 
eyes. “At least I can still tell 
black from white.” 

“How?” Kendy shouted. “You 
had a newspaper over your face. 
You were asleep behind your 
newspaper when I walked in." 

The Guardsman glanced at the 
captain. 

“Look at me,” Kendy yelled. 
“Don’t you remember me? Your 
feet were on your desk. Didn’t 
you even look out from behind 
your newspaper when you stopped 
me on the way out?” 

The Guardsman sat up straight. 
He spat out his cigar. 



“Sir, I never seen this kid be- 
fore in my life.” 

“Look at me,” Kendy shouted. 
“I hit you with my toolbox.” 

The Guardsman’s hand rose to 
his chest. 

“Sir, this kid’s lying in order to 
make me — make us look bad. No 
one got in past me. She tried to 
sneak in. I sent her back. I told 
her to halt when she ran back up 
the stairs. But she ran like she’d 
been doing something. So I chased 
her. Into an ambush — ” 

Kendy realized the Guardsman 
was so embarrassed at having 
tripped at the hedge that he 
hadn’t even mentioned being hit 
by the toolbox. 

“Captain, if you would listen to 
me — ” Kendy began. 

“Sir, do we have to listen to 
this liar?” the Guardsman 
blurted. “He’s a campus trouble- 
maker. I identify her. I recognize 
her face.” 

Kendy supposed the toolbox 
was still lying behind the Guard’s 
desk and that there ought to be 
other ways he could prove that 
Amani was innocent. 

“Listen — ” 

“Put her in the car,” the cap- 
tain said. 

“Hold it,” Kendy said. “L con- 
fess.” 

“Not again,” the captain pro- 
tested, turning away. “Put her in 
the armored car. Students are con- 
greeting.” 

Kendy noticed three students 
standing at a safe distance. 

“I’ll give you all sorts of proof 
that I — ” he yelled following the

captain toward the front of the 
armored car. 

“Then where are her cover- 
alls?” the captain challenged. 

“I ground them up in the dis- 
posal under the dorm — ” 

The engine of the armored car 
started with a stuttering roar. 

“That proves you’re lying to 
protect her,” the captain shouted 
over the noise. I personally order- 
ed all the old basement garbage 
disposals disconnected over a year 
ago.” 

He glared triumphantly at 
Kendy and stepped back up to the 
curb. His arm rose and his wrist 
flipped forward in a limp military 
signal. 

The armored car growled for- 
ward. Kendy jumped in front of 
it, grabbed its upper radiator lou- 
vers as the lower ones hit his hip. 
His beels dragged along the pave- 
ment. 

The captain screamed, “Hold 
it—” 

The armored car’s engine in- 
haled and died. Kendy clung to 
the steel slats which had been de- 
signed to protect its radiator from 
the populace. 

“Goddamn Trojan Horse — ” 

A stentorian voice electronical- 
ly augmented to heroic volume 
boomed against his eardrums. 

“SON-OF-A-BITCHING EN- 
GINE’S FLOODED AGAIN,” 
the invisible Achilles bellowed 
through the car’s loudspeakers. 
“SAM, I TOLD YOU AND 
TOLD YOU TO CHECK THE 
CARBURETOR.” 

Silence. Then a click as the 



Guardsman realized his mike had 
been live. 

The captain’s suddenly minia- 
ture voice yelled, “No — no need 
to radio for reinforcements.” 

H IS hand closed on Kendy’s 
shoulder. The captain tried 
with his other hand to disengage 
Kendy’s fingers from the armored 
car. 

But the captain was not strong 
enough. He was no Achilles. 

“Let her go,” Kendy said thick- 
ly, feeling high and low at the 
same time. 

“Then let go of our car,” the 
captain retorted. “We wouldn’t 
be here if it weren’t for trouble- 
makers like you. Let go. I don’t 
think you intend to be an agita- 
tor. It’s her fault. You’d better 
realize it and cooperate with me. 
I have the power of so many al- 
ternatives I’d prefer not to react 
at all. Return to your room.” 

“Let Amani go.” 

Kendy noticed a timid crowd of 
four students had assembled up- 
wind. 

“But I’ve already committed 
myself,” the captain was explain- 
ing. “I have to detain her for 
questioning. So let go of our 
armored car.” 

The captain’s hand slid into his 
jacket. Kendy struck out and 
clamped down on the captain’s 
wrist, preventing him from ex- 
tracting the gas pen from his 
pocket. 

The captain bent down to say 
quietly, “Look up. Our man in 
the turret has his choice of three 



36 



GALAXY 



aerosol sprays. If I signal him 
you get one in the face.” 

Kendy thought the nozzles 
could not be depressed enough to 
spray him directly. The captain’s 
face was close to his. Kendy tried 
to dislodge the captain’s protec- 
tive visor with his shoulder. 

“We want to maintain our len- 
ient image,” the captain said 
softly. “One aerosol would make 
you vomit. Another would cause 
you to lose control of your bowels. 
The third would make you cry 
like a baby. No one wants to be 
made ridiculous.” 

“That includes you,” Kendy 
grunted, looking around. 

“Even if you run for it — ” the 
captain pretended calm reason — 
“there are many ways we can get 
you. A squirt of invisible dye — 
and every time you passed a se- 
curity streetlight in Greater L.A. 
the ultraviolet component in the 
light would cause your skin to 
glow purple.” 

“Great.” 

“But you can’t escape. Look up 
at the biggest tube in the turret. 
It ejects blobs of quick-drying 
epoxy mixed with chemically 
shrinking polyester strings. If we 
used it you’d be flopping around 
in a glued cocoon. The parabolic 
mike on the turret would catch 
your shrieks of claustrophobia be- 
fore your jaw was pulled shut. 
That voice-print might provide 
supplementary identification at 
the morgue — unless someone 
used a pencil point to open your 
nostrils.” 

Kendy laughed confusedly. 



“Why don’t you just arrest me?” 
“I want to give you amnesty — 
you innocent fool!” 

“Amani?” 

“If she’s innocent — of course. 
What do you think we are? We 
don’t need trouble. I don’t want 
trouble — ” 

“Neither do I.” Kendy let go 
and flinched. 

H e expected the captain to 
spray him with the gas pen. 
But the other shook his hand cer- 
emoniously, as if before an audi- 
ence of students. Bushes rustled 
in the momentary silence. 

“Let’s walk over to my little 
command car”’ the captain said. 
Kendy’s knees were rubbery. 
“Where?” 

“You can walk,” the captain 
said. “Concentrate on walking. 
That whiff of gas in the room 
should have worn off by now. 
Come on. Your symptoms are 
mainly psychosomatic ones now. 
You’ve stopped fighting it. That’s 
why you feel like collapsing.” 
Kendy felt so suddenly relaxed 
and dizzy he wanted to laugh. He 
realized he had wanted the cap- 
tain to disbelieve his confession.^ 
His emotions flip-flopped. He 
wanted to cry because he under- 
stood himself too well. If he had 
really wanted the captain to listen 
to him he would have described 
the centrifuge. He would have 
told the captain about the pic- 
tures. But he hadn’t been able to 
make a total confession — not even 
to save Amani. 

What am I? 



TOMORROW CUM LAUDE

He felt disillusioned with him- 
self. 

The motor of the armored car 
roared. The antique growled past 
him, carrying Amani away. 

“Wait—” 

While the captain helped him 
into the command car Kendy 
chattered frantically to himself. 

“Never confess to anything. 
There are mofe^prag — pragmatic 
choices than guilt or innocence. 
Are you listening? Don’t drive so 
slow! Fast? You won’t find her 
fingerprints in the — why should I 
tell you? She’ll pass your lie de- 
tector test. Ooooooooeeeeh — ” 

“You’ll bump your head.” The 
captain steered his command car 
to University Boulevard. “You’re 
naive, son. I hate to disillusion 
you about her.” 

“But she’s innocent,” Kendy 
murmured. “And you’ll lose 
your — I’m sorry,” he moaned, 
“for what I’ve done.” 

“Like what? I’m sorry that you 
were accidentally assigned as her 
roommate,” the captain stated. 
“I might as well explain to you 
while you’re so gassed and recep- 
tive. She’s not the first to dress 
up in coveralls and sneak into a 
building to visit her boy friend.” 

“Boy friend?” 

“Probably a campus mainte- 
nance employee. Probably that’s 
the reason she tried to enter the 
C.R.A.D. Building. It’s not a 
serious offense if that was her 
reason.” 

“You’re crazy.” 

Kendy laughed and felt rage 
seeping into his consciousness. 



“I understand them,” the cap- 
tain earnestly pontificated, “bet- 
ter than they understand them- 
selves. Last year we had a case 
like this. A custodial employee 
sneaked his girlfried into a re- 
stricted area. I understand these 
— people.” 

“You’re lumping them all to- 
gether.” Kendy laughed unevenly. 
“When I say them I’m doing it, 
too.” He clutched the captain’s 
arm and the car swerved. “Don’t 
squeeze us together,” Kendy 
cried. “Our faces — her face is dis- 
appearing. I don’t want you do 
that to Amani. She’s Amani all 
by herself. That’s who she is — 
Amani.” He blurted, “You won’t 
have a face, you — faceless uni- 
form.” 

The command car turned into 
a sunken driveway. The Cam- 
pus National Guard Building 
crouched behind floodlights. 
Above it, towering against the sky, 
was the dim majesty of ‘the Do- 
heny Library. 

Kendy laughed. 

“Your own fault,” the captain 
retorted, “that we’re here to keep 
the schools open.” 

“But I was just a little kid ten 
years ago — when the emergency 
was declared.” 

“You need us. The schools were 
burning.” 

“You were shooting — ” 

“Who do you think headed off 
the white vigilantes? We did. The 
National Guard. Sniped at from 
both sides.” 

“I don’t want either side,” Ken- 
dy muttered. “I want Amani.”

T he garage doors clanged shut 
behind the automobile. The 
Captain parked next to the arm- 
ored car. Kendy stepped out of 
the car, looked down at the cap- 
tain’s helmet and felt dizzy. 

“I’m a helluva lot bigger than 
you are.” 

“I have the authority, how- 
ever,” the captain replied. “Go in 
there and sit down.” 

Kendy stumbled into a recep- 
tion room. He looked for Amani, 
bumped his leg against a low ta- 
ble. Its coffee urn hissed. 

“Sit down, please.” Behind the 
counter, facing a switchboard, 
was a uniformed young lady with 
a sharp nose and chin. “Sit down, 
please.” 

“I protest.” 

She pointed to the coffee urn. 
“Serve yourself,” her voice said 
mechanically. 

“To sober me up? I’ll pour it 
on the couch.” 

“You’re being filmed and the 
film will be sent to your parents.” 
“Where’s Amani?” 

He saw that the room had no 
windows but the wall facing Uni- 
versity Boulevard featured a row 
of steel-capped — peepholes? 

“I do not have that informa- 
tion,” the young woman said 
tonelessly. 

“I refuse!” he shouted. 

“Refuse what?” she asked, 
glancing at him and becoming 
slightly human as she unplugged 
the electrical connection from 
her ear. 

“To take a lie detector test.” 
“No one asked you.” 



Her switchboard buzzed and 
she turned away. 

“Where’s Amani?” he- repeat- 
edly demanded from the couch 
while his dizziness from the spray 
diminished and finally his mount- 
ing indignation helped him rise 
again. “I want Amani. I’m going 
to get her.” 

“Go ahead.” The captain was 
standing behind the counter, 
scowling at him. “Go in.” 

Through the partly open door 
he glimpsed a dentist’s chair or 
an electric chair on a chair 
equipped with a polygraph, a lie 
detector unit. He walked past it. 

“Amani?” 

She was standing in front of a 
steel-framed mirror, one hand 
clawing back her limp hair. Her 
expression was one of distaste — - 
for her hair? She turned, her gaze 
narrowing. 

He thought they were alone and 
pushed the door shut behind him 
with his foot. 

“Amani?” 

“Endal” she said in a strangely 
harsh voice. "Panya mwana- 
funzi” 

He realized she was telling him 
to go away — and worse. 

“I guess this room is bugged,” 
he muttered, unable to accept any 
other reason for her speaking to 
him this way. 

He knew the word mwanajunzi 
meant student. He thought panya 
meant rat. 

He reached out his hand, want- 
ing to touch her. 

“Amani, I — ” 

"Panya mdogol" For some

reason she was e\en refusing to 
speak English to^ him. '"Panya 
mdogo mdogo." 

Her mouth twisted. Now she 
was calling him a smaller rat of 
maybe a mouse. 

“Amani,” he tried again but 
heard the door opening behind 
him. 

“I’m ready to leave,” she said 
in cold English but not to him. 

She spoke past him, as if he 
weren't there. 

The uniformed young woman 
from the switchboard or a similar 
one was standing in the doorway 
with a bored expression. 

“Go on. You can go.” 

Amani swished past him and 
out into the reception room. She 
hurried toward the steel exit door 
at the front of the building. 

Kendy glimpsed the captain 
leaning against the counter and 
heard his apologetic voice. He 
was speaking into the telephone, 
apparently trying to explain 
something. He was blind to Ken- 
dy. 

Kendy ran after Amani without 
asking if he could leave. She had 
pushed open the outer door. It 
swung back in his face. He shoved 
it outward, lurched into the glar- 
ing night. For an instant Amani 
was silhouetted by floodlights 
guarding buildings on the other 
concrete path. She turned left 
along the pedestrian Boulevard, 
as if trying to leave the campus. 

He saw the mob had increased 
to five students and a cat, loung- 
ing beside the statue of Tommy 
Trojan, watching them. 



“Wait, Amani, let me explain 
why I — ” 

He thought he could corner her 
at the National Guard booth, 
which defended the entrance to 
the University. But its barbed- 
wire gate was ajar. It had been 
opened for her. 



S HE ran toward the roaring traf- 
fic on Exposition Boulevard. 
On the other side loomed the 
immense bulk of the old Los An- 
geles Memorial Coliseum. Beyond 
lay Nairobi. Buses roared. He 
grabbed her arm as she stepped 
off the curb. 

“Wait for the light. I mean — 
don’t go.” 

“Don’t touch me, you lying — 
what are you? You were the one 
who tried to sneak into that build- 
ing past that Guardsman. So why 
did those pigs arrest me?” 

“Amani, I had no idea this 
would happen. I didn’t think — ” 
“You had a bottle of Passblack. 
Didn't you? I thought about tel- 
ling those bayonet pigs to hunt 
for it.” 

“I threw it away.” 

“They found those cotton 
gloves in our bathroom. They 
said they were mine. I should 
have said they were yours— you — 
what are you anyway?” 

“I didn’t think.” 

“I think you were using us,” 
she blurted. “Why else would 
you fake yourself Black? You 
tried to burglar into that build- 
ing. Didn’t you know you’d make 
trouble for every Black on this

campus? When anything is bad 
they blame us all — ” 

“I didn’t think — ” 

She studied him, her gaze 
gentling. 

“I can’t believe you’re a racist 
provocateur,” she murmured. 
“You weren’t trying to start the 
whites shooting at us again — ” 

His jaw sagged. He felt horri- 
fied at what she had suggested 
— and equally at his own innocence 
and stupidity. He had known so 
little about his own country. 

“Amani, no — ” 

“I signed a confession,” she 
cried. 

“What?” 

He couldn’t believe it. 

“It was because — at least you 
were an enemy of the Guardsmen. 
Otherwise why would you be 
breaking into their building? Ken- 
dy, I didn’t tell them about your 
bottle of Passblack. I didn’t ex- 
plain about the gloves because — I 
think, I hope you’re a member of 
the Underground. If they found 
out — those Guardsmen would 
have detained you, sent you to a 
camp. You are against them, 
aren’t you?” 

Kendy swayed dizzily. He 
couldn’t tell her the truth. She 
would hate him totally if he did. 

“You were innocent,” he pro- 
tested. “What did you sign?” 

“Nobody should be innocent,” 
she said angrily, “so 1 signed their 
Number Three confession. It says 
I failed to cooperate during an in- 
vestigation. It’s funny. I did co- 
operate. I sat down in their elec- 
tric chair. They asked me why I 



tried to sneak into a building at 
night. They tried to tell me why. 
Supposedly I have a main man 
who works in there.” Her teeth 
flashed. “Maybe I should be flat- 
tered. But I told the machine the 
truth. I don’t. It believed me.” 

“Kendy muttered, “They’re all 
insane.” 

“When their machine kept be- 
lieving me,” she said, “the Man’s 
face got pale — such an ugly color. 
He said he was going to question 
me all night if necessary. So I 
signed that confession. Kendy, I 
wanted to go home. I want to go 
home — but I feel ashamed. At 
least my confession says I didn’t 
cooperate,” she laughed unevenly. 
“At least you’re a member of the 
Resistance.” 

Kendy winced. He felt terribly 
guilty and not guilty. He would 
never be able to tell her the truth. 
He was — had been — a spy from 
National University, the govern- 
ment’s own training school. He 
had enrolled at U.S.C. to test 
campus security. What he had 
done was test the National Guard, 
to improve its security proce- 
dures, to strengthen it. He 
couldn’t tell her that. She would 
think he was her enemy. But he 
wasn’t. 

“Wait, Amani — I love you.” 

“I don’t love you, Kendy. Let 
go of me.” ' 

She dodged away through the 
screeching traffic on Exposition 
Boulevard. He ran after her 
across the midnight lawns around 
the Coliseum. He heard a bound- 
ary Guardsman blowing his whis-

tie. She wriggled expertly through 
the barbed wire fence. It snagged 
him. 

“Get back to your own side of 
the street,” she gasped. “I’ll send 
Don for my things. I can’t come 
back to S.C. But I’ll come back 
somewhere else — because it’s my 
country. I want to be a whole per- 
son, a dancer or teacher or — I 
don’t know what. I’m not running 
away — ” she cried as she walked 
away from him into shadows that 
moved. ^ 

Confronted by the ^gleaming 
rifle barrels of Black Security 
Patrolmen, he didn’t climb 
through their fence. He watched 
her pass through their Nairobi 
Checkpoint. 

“Go home, kid,” said the white 
Guardsman beside him, on his 
side of the fence, “or I’ll arrest 
you for a troublemaker.” 

Kendy’s fist tightened on the 
wire. 

“Sure.” 

He felt his heart pounding like 
a war drum as he crossed Exposi- 
tion Boulevard. He thrust his 
thick plastic card at the Guards- 
man at the entrance to the Univ- 
ersity. He strode along University 
Boulevard. He looked up at the 
bronze statue of Tommy Trojan. 

Wake up, stupid. 

H igh above Tommy’s crested 
helmet stars were gleaming. 
Suddenly the distance in time be- 
tween the City of Troy — buried 
three thousand years beside the 
Dardanelles — and the decaying 
newness of Los Angeles seemed 



encouragingly short to 
Across each- hundred years he 
visualized three generations of 
men. He smiled because the his- 
torical distance from Troy to L.A. 
was only ninety men lined up in 
time-changed costumes. It was 
a short time in which to expect 
men to awaken. But he walked 
faster. 

“1 will,” he murmured, feeling 
as if his life were a momentarily 
glowing .spark. 

He had to hurry. 

He thought of Mr. Smith at 
National University intricately 
plotting his future. Mr. Smith 
might never know what a blun- 
dering spy Kendy had been. He 
smiled wryly at the way he had 
confessed and confessed. He 
v^ouldn't do that again. 

He would continue his tutorial 
with Dr. Smyert. Now he really 
wanted to learn. What was it like 
on the other side? He wanted to 
see. If they didn’t shoot him, he 
thought bemusedly, the exper- 
ience might help him grow. 

Toward what? 

He cocked his head, eyeing the 
stars. The power was out there, 
signaling across a billion years, 
beeping into the surviving radio- 
telescopes in the United States. 
It seemed untranslatable — but 
perhaps there were undiscovered 
Rosetta Stones? The Russians 
. had discovered something on 
Phobos and retreated. Frantically 
they had begun searching our own 
Moon. They had something there 
beneath a fragile plastic dome 
and were afraid.

But not afraid of power? 

They’re afraid of change. 

He wasn’t. 

Of course, you never knew 
about change — what it was going 
to be or where it would take you. 
Something had changed him late- 
ly- 

As he strode along Childs Way 
his thoughts ran back to Amani. 
His throat hurt. He felt incom- 
plete. His personal world had 
been so small. And he knew Nai- 
robi would never satisfy Amani. 
Nor would any other city-state. 
The whole world seemed to be 
hardening while people struggled 
to fit into it. 

He considered himself and was 
ashamed. 

But nobody’s impossible. 
He looked up. 

Even diamonds come from 
muck. 

He grimaced. He was growing 
up, whatever that meant. He 
smiled, still feeling gassed. Like 
a fool he wanted power — but not 
to change the world, exactly. He 
inhaled, imagining a world free 
to change itself in every direction 
for everyone. He walked faster, 
visualizing a world diversifying 
to fit each person. 

Like worlds growing for every- 
one. 

With youthful resiliency he ran 
through the night. 

Beautiful worlds. To fit us, 
Amani. Changing as we 
change. 

As he leaped through the daz- 
zling darkness he felt his worlds 
overlap. 

Dance beautifully, Amani. •

T he thing was, Nick Russell 
told himself irritably, he had 
not been that drunk. He remem- 
bered coming back to the hotel, 
hanging up his clothes, piling into 
bed. So why was his collar too 
tight and what in God’s name was 
he doing in a chair? 

He opened one eye, wincing 
at the light. What he saw made 
no sense, and he closed the eye 
again. 

He had been to two of thpse 
places in Pig Alley where the girls 
took off everything except their 
hats. Next had come that little 



bar on the side street and the 
snooty brunette in the low-cut 
dress — boy, he had told her off — 
then he had said the hell with it 
and had gone to bed. 

Now he had on all his clothes 
and the damn things were too 
tight. He grunted, opened both 
eyes. The walls were funny. TV 
screens, gadgets everywhere. He 
tried to get up but could not. 

He stared incredulously at him- 
self. Broad white straps crossed 
his chest and thighs. Under them 
he wore a brown sports Jacket 
and the pants of his good blue 



45 




suit, a red necktie and a bright 
yellow sports shirt. 

“Is this supposed to be fun- 
ny?” he asked out loud. He pulled 
at the straps. They would not give. 
He filled his lungs. 

“Hey, let me out of here.” 

A voice at his left elbow made 
him jump. 

“Wer spracht? Was . ist los 
hier?” 

Another voice came from his 
right. 

“Qu’est-que-c'est que se passe? 
Qui parle? Laissez-moi, je vous 
en prie. ’ ’ 

“Talk English, dammit.” 

His necktie was choking him. 
It was in some kind of crazy knot 
he had to untie it to get off the 
tie. He squirmed around in his 
chair as far as he could but it was 
not far enough. The buckles must 
be in back. 

His heart was thumping. 

“Listen,” he said loudly, “I’m 
an American citizen and if I don’t 
get out of here pretty damn quick 
there’s going to be hell to pay.” 
This little room, no door, yellow 
walls, all those gadgets. “You out 
there, you hear me?” 

The other voices started again. 
They seemed to come from grilles 
in the walls — under the two big 
TV screens. 

"Je suis ingenieur du R.T.F. 
On me cherchera, je vous assure 
si je n ’irai pas d mon travail. 
Pourquoi m’avez-vous enleve?" 



"Wer spracht, ich hab’ Sie 
gefragt! Sprechen Sie nichi 
Deutsch?" 

Both voices sounded as upset 
and bewildered as Russell himself 
felt. Could there be three of them, 
tied down to chairs in little rooms 
like this one? And if so, what for? 
Russell stared around, trying to 
figure it out. The wall in front of 
him was curved, like part of an 
upright cylinder only about a yard 
wide. The cylinder was covered 
with gadgets. The wall behind him 
was curved, too — he could just 
make it out by straining around 
in the chair. The two side walls, 
the ones with the TV screens, 
slanted toward each other. The 
room was shaped like a wedge 
of cheese, with a hunk cut off at 
the point. Put three rooms just 
like this one together and what 
would you get? A disk, with a 
cylinder in the middle. 

“Flying disk,” he said aloud. 
“Oh, God.” 

“Comprends pas. Je ne parle 
ni I’anglais ni I’aUemand. Parlez 
frangais, nom de Dieut" 

Parlay fransay, he knew that 
much. And du vang, and voolay 
voo cooshay avec mwah? That was 
all you needed to get along in 
Paris— the Frogs all spoke English, 
anyhow. 

"Ich verlange das Sie—’’ 

The German voice cut off and 
Russell grabbed the arms of his 
chair. All the wall gadgets had just 



46 



GALAXY 



lit up. Red ones, yellow, green. 
The TV screen at the right showed 
a picture of the Earth, a green- 
and-yellow ring around it. There 
was a yellow blip where the green 
and yellow met and after a mo- 
ment he could see that the blip 
was moving slowly. The screen 
to his left was divided into three 
segments, with a bunch of colored 
dots in each one, Now what? The 
dots seemed to be arranged in the 
same pattern as the gadgets in 
front of him. 

“Green, red, yellow,” he said. 
At the sound of his voice, one 
segment of the screen blinked yel- 
low. “That’s funny.” 

It blinked again. 

"Was bedeutet das Licht?” 

One of the other segments 
blinked, 

"C’est bizarre, ga — ’’ Now the 
third segment blinked. "Attention, 
c’est nous! Nous trois! Id le boche, 
la I’americain ...” 

In the other screen, the yellow 
blip had advanced a little farther, 
trailing its green line, eating up 
the yellow line ahead of it. 

Russell cleared his throat. 

“Look, you two guys. My 
name is Russell- Nick Russdl. 
Dorr’t either one of you speak 
any English?” 

"Content de faire votre con- 
naissance. Monsieur Russell. Per- 
mettez que je me presente aussi: 
je m’appelle Duvoisin. Mais, a re- 
pondre a votre question — non, je 



n’ai que quelques mots d’anglais. 
Parlons francais?’’ 

"Ich sprache nur Deutsch. Das 
ist fiir mich genug. Ich heisse 
Kalbmann. ’’ 

“Kalbmann? Glad to know 
you.” 

"Enchante. ’’ 

“Look, I don’t know what 
this is all about but it seems like 
we’re all in it together. There’s 
got to be some way to get out of 
this thing, if we just — woop!” 

A distant roaring, more felt 
than heard. A heavy weight was 
pressing him back into the chair. 
It lasted for a few seconds, then 
cut off abruptly. He felt himself 
swing forward against the straps 
again. In the right-hand screen, 
the track of the yellow blip was 
no longer traveling in a circle. 
The yellow line dipped down in a 
long curve until it touched the 
Earth. The blip began to travel 
along it. 

"Attention, pour I’ amour de 
Dieu! Nous tombons!’’ 

Russell stared at one screen, 
then the other. In the left-hand 
screen dots in two of the seg- 
ments were blinking urgently— yel- 
low in one, green in the other. 

"Versteh ’ nicht. Verst eh’ nicht. 
Warum dann —’’ 

Yellow, that was the one that 
was blinking as the German talked. 
Green must be the Frenchman, 
In his own segment, the bottom 
one, nothing was happening.

"Mais pourquoi attendez-vous? 
Appuyez sur les boutons, mon 
Dieu!” 

T he right-hand screen’s blip 
was sliding down its yellow 
arc. Russell began to feel alarmed. 
Could that mean what he thought 
it meant? He swung to the left- 
hand screen again. A yellow but- 
ton and a green one, the same 
as the gadgets in front of him. 
He leaned forward and tried to- 
press them but they wouldn’t go 
in. Must be the other two people 
were supposed to press them — so 
why didn’t they? 

“Hey, you guys, press the but- 
tons!’’ 

The yellow blip was sliding 
inexorably down its arc. Now the 
other two were both yelling. He 
put his hands over his ears and 
tried to think. His own segment 
remained blank. They were sup- 
posed to push the buttons — a hor- 
rible thought. Suppose their seg- 
ments were blank, too, and 
Russell knew which buttons they 
were supposed to press but they 
didn’t. And they knew — the dots 
of color went on blinking. 

“Jesus Christ,’’ he said. “Lis- 
ten, you what’s-your-name, the 
Frenchy! Push the green button, 
the one in the third row, you 
understand me? Push the green 
button!” 

“Monsieur, c’est absolument

“Warum konnen Sie nichtspra-

“Listen to me, for God’s sake.

button, you hear me? The one on 
top! Push it, you .dumb Kraut!” 
“Monsieur Russell, je vous en 
prie — appuyez — ” 

“Don’t keep talking Frog to

pain— just press the green button

“Lasst mich auch etwas sagen.

Mike’s bronzed skin and ath- 
letic build contrasted oddly with 
his brother’s clerical pallor and 
soft, well-manicured hands. 

“I knew you were going to 
say that, John, before I came 
here.” 

“Each of us has always known 
what the other would say. So of 
course you won’t go to the police?” 
Mike impatiently brushed back 
a lock of black hair. 

“I can’t, John. Bergan’s boys 
will swear I killed Judy. And she 
was shot with my gun. I could 
be convicted of murder.” 

“Haven’t you overlooked one 
thing? You have enough evidence 
of dozens of other crimes your 
associates have committed to be- 
come state’s witness — bargain for 
your life.” 

“Even an innocent man can’t 
bargain away murder— once the 
case is in the courts. I can’t get 
near the police without being ar- 
rested. I can’t stay much longer 
in Jax, either. I don’t have a 
car and Bergan’s men are watch- 
ing the airports and other means 
of transport. I’m being hunted. 
I shouldn’t even be herewith you.” 
“Let me take your evidence to 
the police,” John said. 

“You know I can’t let you do 
that. Do you think the people 
you call my associates—” Mike 
paused and grinned again — “would 
stop at killing a man of God?” 
“I’m not afraid.” 



“Look, John. Just get me out 
of town. That’s all I ask — for now, 
anyhow. I shouldn’t even ask that 
much but I have to get away some- 
where while I figure this thing out. 
I’ll think about giving you the 
stuff later, maybe.” 

“Do you have any money?” 
Mike shrugged sardonically. “I 
just sold my body to City General 
Hospital for their tissue bank. One 
hundred bucks. We’ll pick it up 
on the way. I’ll make out. Just 
get me out of town.” 

“You sold your body?” 

“Sure. What’s wrong With 
that?” 

“Nothing, I guess. The soul 
survives.” 

J OHN stood at the gothic frame 
of the rectory window. Gaz- 
ing out into the north-Florida spring 
morning he looked the classic pic- 
ture of the man of God. When he 
turned he had reached a decision. 

“Before I do try to get you 
away from here, Michael, I want 
you to tell me about this heroin 
thing. Were you guilty of smug- 
gling drugs into this country? How 
did you get into this dirty business?” 
“Yes. I was guilty. I’ll tell you 
the story again. I didn’t know 
what I was smuggling. Beating 
the law was kind of exciting — 
and profitable. When I found out 
what the packages I was bringing 
in contained I tried to break away 
from the gang. They killed Judy

as a warning to me to stay away 
from the police — and to get me to 
leave town. They’ll kill me if I’m 
caught. They may kill me anyway. 
Bergan’s the man behind the smug- 
gling— and Bergan runs this town.” 

Mike finished. His brother eyed 
him quietly, then took a hat from 
the mantel. 

“All right, Mike. Meet me 
in the little street in back. I’ll 
go out the front. You go out 
through here.” He indicated a 
door leading to the rear of the 
rectory. “Give me just five minutes 
to bring the car. We’ll go by the 
hospital.” 

Alone in the room, Mike sur- 
veyed it briefly, then took a thick, 
unmarketl envelope from his coat 
pocket and stuffed it among some 
untidy papers in the back of the 
center drawer of his brother’s desk. 
Once or twice while waiting the 
required five minutes he started 
toward the desk as if to retrieve 
the envelope. Then, with a doubtful 
grimace at his watch, he left it 
there and made his way out to 
the alley. 

The brothers saw no one when 
they left the street behind the 
rectory but Mike gave directions 
for a pattern of turns which he 
hoped would throw off any trailers. 
As he crouched deep in his seat 
tension made pain in his back and 
neck. From time to time he stole 
glances at his brother’s serene, 
assured figure, upright in the 



driver’s seat. For a moment he 
felt a wave of tenderness for the 
stern, gentle body beside him, so 
much like his own. But he could 
never have lived John’s kind of 
life. 

They approached the emergency 
entrance of the City General Hospi- 
tal-. A dark sedan skidded out of 
a side street and pulled level with 
them on the driver’s side. Mike 
had time only to see the machine- 
gun and grab John’s clerical collar 
and slam him down on the seat, 
then leap out of the car. 

The bullets caught him as he 
scrambled up the hospital steps. 
He felt a monstrous -shock in his 
spine just above the collar as blood 
and white chips of bone sprayed 
the lower panel of the door marked 
EMERGENCY. 

Then he felt nothing. 

N othing. Then, slowly, an 

awareness of the passage of 
time. Months? Years? Cold. Deadly 
cold, iron hard. A cold not felt 
but only known. 

Silence. No sound. Not even 
the dull drumming of blood in 
the ears one hears when listening 
to nothing. No movement, no ris- 
ing and falling of the diaphragm, 
no shifting of the eyes beneath 
closed lids, no imperceptibly 
balancing muscles. Darkness. Ab- 
solute darkness. Nothing but an 
impossibly thin thread of conscious- 
ness.

I’m Mike Kerling and I’m alive. 
Hang on to' that, Mike, boy. You’re 
alive . 

T WO interns in white pushed 
open the door marked CRYO- 
GENIC STORAGE. They carried 
thick, padded gloves. A puff of 
cold air, electric with dryness, came 
out as the door closed behind them. 

The first intern scanned a row 
of receptacles like huge file drawers 
in^ the wall. He ran a chrome and 
rubber trolley up under one of 
them. 

“C-15,” he said. 

He donned his gloves and turned 
a chromed wheel, raising the trolley 
to the exact level of the lower 
edge of the vault. A light tap 
with a rubber hammer broke the 
thin seal of frost at its edges 
and the door swung open with a 
puff of searing cold air. 

“Who was this joker? Do you 
know?” 

“Yeah. A guy some gangster 
shot right in front of Emergency 
years ago. Bullets took out a four- 
inch section of his cervical verte- 
brae. They had him in here in 
minutes. He’d only signed donor’s 
papers a day or two before.” 
“Kind of rushing things, 
weren’t they? Was he legally dead? 
Or medically dead for that matter?” 
“Who knows? But at the then 
state of the art there was sure 
as hell no favorable prognosis for 
him.” 



A bright metal cylinder a yard 
in diameter rolled out onto the 
trolley. A twist of a wrench in 
gloved hands split the tube longi- 
tudinally, revealing the white body 
of a man, crisp black hair faintly 
powdered with frost, a determined, 
full-lipped mouth framed in deep 
vertical creases. The thorax gaped 
open, revealing a cavity where the 
heart once beat, cut ends of veins 
and arteries indicating missing kid- 
neys, oddly geometrical patches 
of vanished skin showing pale mus- 
cular tissue beneath. 

“Suppose he wasn’t dead. 
Could he have known what was 
happening to him? When they were 
cooling the body down, I mean.” 
“Pretty damned unlikely.” 
“Yeah. But suppose he did 
know? Nobody ran an EEG on 

him, did they?” 

“Don’t suppose so.” 

“Could have had some brain 
action for months — even after they 
froze him. When they do cryogenic 
brain surgery the alpha rhythm 
never even falters. Wonder what 
he thought when they did the first 
transplant from him?” 

“Shut up, why don’t you?” 
The second intern grinned and 
went on needling while the first 
continued careful preparations to 
raise the body above the level 
of its hemicylindrical coffin. 

“He might even feel those pieces 
of skin when someone accidentally 
sticks a pin in them. You know, 



GOD OF COOL

like some amputees claim they 
can feel an itch in a missing arm?” 
“Lay off, for Christ’s sake.” 
“You’re going in for neuro- 
surgery. You ought to think about 
these things. How about that thing 
Birnbaum did a while back. You 
remember the frog bit? Touch a 
severed frog leg with a galvanic 
probe and it kicks. Birnbaum stimu- 
lated the frog’s brain and the leg 
kicked even when it was fifty yards 
away in another room. How about 
that? Suppose 
“Shut up.” 

Silence fell for a time. One 
intern wore a faint grin, the other 
a frown. With infinite care — to 
avoid chipping the ice-hard flesh 
or touching it with bare hands — 
they worked with sterile, motor- 
driven saws to section the right 
arm above the elbow. As it came 
away the first intern asked a serious 
question. 

“Who gets this?” 

“A guy who used to be a pretty 
good surgeon until the AM A tossed 
him out for keeping bad company,” 
the other said grudgingly. “They 
say he patches up people the police 
shoot up and keeps his mouth 
shut. Nosy today, aren’t you?” 
The arm was laid carefully into 
a metal tray on another trolley. 
The huge tube was resealed and slid 
carefully into its vault. Valves, 
tubes and meters carrying liquid 
nitrogen were checked. 

The interns left, pushing the 



small trolley with the arm. The 
cryogenic storage room was silent, 
save for the whispering hum of 
tireless motors. 



¥ ACKING stimulus of any kind, 
^ the spidery thread of cryogenic 
consciousness that was Mike Ker- 
ling roamed the edges of madness. 
A man’s vivid memories are piti- 
fully few. In the endlessness of 
black, silent, and immeasurable 
time Mike recreated them not once 
but many times. 

He recalled that the days of 
John’s illness with polio had been 
a period of misery for the little 
boy who hovered between his 
strangely lifeless toys and the door 
to his brother’s room. Sometimes 
he had been sure he could feel 
John’s pain in his own thin body. 
Then John was learning to walk 
again, his flabby arm around Mike’s 
sturdy shoulders. There had also 
been the day when their father, 
a huge, patient and grave man, 
had taken them to a neighbor’s 
pool. John had been the first to 
learn to swim without the support 
of Dad’s big hand. 

Mike tried often to picture his 
father’s face but it would not 
come clear. His mother he could 
not recall at all. Both had died 
long ago in a car crash. The 
orphanage had been mostly a gray 
iron double bunk, John’s bed be- 
low, his own above.

Mike remembered the first girl 
he had ever kissed, a brown-eyed 
precocious beauty with a pageboy 
bob. He had kissed her hurriedly 
and clumsily in the orphanage pan- 
try. The memory of that kiss was 
sweet now. 

Then there had been the time 
just before he went north to take 
up his college scholarship and his 
first job, when, at the Kiwanis 
beach picnic, he had slipped his 
fingers under his girl’s sweater, 
touching the soft, naked curve of 
her young breast. She had hesitated 
a heart-thundering moment before 
she had wriggled out of his arms 
and run back to join the others 
at the campfire.- He could no longer 
remember her name. 

His graduation was only rows 
of black cap-and-gowned figures 
seen from behind in the auditorium. 
The day John was ordained was 
more vivid in his memory than 
his own graduation— he had felt 
derision, envy. 

Mike’s succession of post-col- 
lege jobs furnished his present dark- 
ness only with brief, disconnected 
flashes, some of them meaningless. 

Then the army. His first ex- 
perience of the Orient and his 
first taste of combat. He had wet 
his fatigues while admiring his 
courage. He had killed — and had 
found he liked the men he slew. 

These memories Mike lived over 
and over in his near-mad awareness 
in the unseen darkness. His con- 



sciousness shut out memories of 
his wife, Judy, as too painful. He 
had been the cause of her death — 
and would find a way to avenge 
them both if ever a moment of 
true consciousness were granted 
him. But for now she was simply 
dead. 

Once, after the uncounted 
thousandth repetition of his tattered 
string of memories, Mike was con- 
scious of words forming in his 
mind, the substance of a sermon. 

John’s voice. 

. in an age when men have 
learned to replace a human heart, 
failing organs, crushed limbs, even 
nerves — and soon, they say, eyes 
that will see again. In an age, / 
say, when dedicated men are la- 
boring to make death almost un- 
necessary, other men are stalking 
the streets of this city, murdering 
with impunity. 

John — oh, John, you fool. 
Stop — they 'll kill you . 

Mike knew fear. 

His effort to reach John some- 
how — to silence him — stretched the 
impalpable fiber of his own exist- 
ence until, for the first time, Mike 
felt pain. A mounting tower of 
shriveling fire. Death, final and 
irrevocable, lay just beyond a snap- 
ping strand of spider’s web. 



S MOKE from a cheap cigar hung 
in the air, palely outlining an 
anemic ray of sun which crept

horizontally into the dim basement 
apartment. Two men sat there. 
One, gray and bloated, sat in a 
straight chair before a small table 
scattered with surgical instruments. 
His sleeves were rolled to the el- 
bow. The left forearm was thick 
and hairy, the right pale and clean- 
lined. Hewas making short, delicate 
incisions in a strip of brown wrap- 
ping paper, pausing occasionally 
to sip from a glass. 

The second man, narrow-eyed 
and flashily handsome, stirred rest- 
lessly and gestured with the cigar. 

“How’s it going. Doc?” he 
said in a flat, disinterested voice. 

Dr. O’Byme grunted sourly. 

“Okay, I guess. It doesn’t re- 
spond quite normally yet. I get 
a sort of burning in it sometimes 
— like the room was suddenly on 
fire. Nerves still mending, I sup- 
pose. Twitches, too, now and then, 
as if it weren’t my own.” 

The younger man tapped a 
gray gob of ash onto the greasy 
carpet and spread it with the 
pointed toe of his shoe. 

“It ain’t. It belongs to that 
punk, Mike Kerling, that tried 
to rat on Bergan a couple of 
years back. That’s comical. If 
Kerling knew who was using it 
now — and what for — them fingers 
would be around your throat some 
night.” 

O’Byme flung down the scalpel 
with a snarl. 

“Damn you to hell, Rionna. 



Some day I’ll take a hunk of lead 
out of you down here and you’ll 
learn not to be so wise.” 

I N CRYOGENIC STORAGE the 
eternally whispering pumps tire- 
lessly circulated the liquid nitrogen 
and Mike Kerling searched for 
new images to add to his meager 
chaplet of memories. From time 
to time the more impassioned pas- 
sages of John’s sermons entered 
Mike’s black cave of consciousness 
with almost the effect of light. 
At other times thoughts of Judy 
and revenge brought flashes of 
fiery torture Mike shrank from 
— then returned to, like a child 
prodding a bruise. 

One day Mike felt his right 
arm. It moved, apparently of its 
own volition, the hand and fingers 
doing something at once firm and 
delicately precise. He considered 
it, then cautiously attempted to 
control its motions. Instantly it 
was alive with fire and Mike re- 
coiled, gibbering, from the true 
darkness of death. 

Never do that again . 

Here was a danger not to be 
prodded. Let the arm recover move- 
ment and sensation in its own way. 
That way lay hope. 

The spark of hope brought 
its own burning but less intense 
and requiring no effort of will 
to quench it. But to John’s ser- 
mons and his own visions of things 
past Mike added a subjective in-

terest in the movements of a hand 
and arm — and forcecL hovering 
madness back another inch. 

I N THE kitchen surgery of Doc 
O’Byrne’s basement apartment 
Bergan’s gunman, Rionna, lay 
squealing on a high white table. 
He was calling on a whole calen- 
dar of saints. A white cloth cover- 
ing his nose and mouth was 
stained by the overflowing pool 
of blood brimming from his eye- 
sockets. 

“Mary, Holy Mother! The pain 
— I can’t stand the pain. Doc 
— do something — give me a shot 
of something—” 

O’Byrne plunged a needle into 
Rionna’s arm and watched im- 
passively as the gunman began 
to relax. Rionna took a deep 
shuddering breath. 

“Doc. Am I gonna be blind?” 
“I reckon.” Doc shrugged. 
“Piggy’s razor sliced through both 
eyeballs. You should have left his 
woman alone.” 

“Stuff that. Can’t you do some- 
thing? Give me a couple new eyes? 
I seen in the paper it can be done 
riow. You’ll doit, won’t you Doc?” 
“Not me. Even if I had the 
use of the hospital facilities I can’t 
trust this hand. It burns me some- 
times and I have to drop the 
scalpel. Maybe Bergan can get 
City General to do something. I 
don’t know. He’s got influence 
at City Hall.” O’Byrne chuckled. 



“Kerling’s stiff’s still got eyes. 
Blue ones. How’d you like those?” 
“No. Not him. Not him. Doc.” 
Rionna’s voice, despite the heavy 
sedative, rose to a scream. “Doc, 
them burning pains you got. He 
does that. The eyes — Jesus — think 
what he’d do with the eyes.” 

“Superstitious bastard. Better 
Kerling’s eyes than peddling pen- 
cils on some lousy street corner. 
I’m going to call Bergan, you 
hear?” 

No response. Rionna had 
fainted. 

I NEXORABLE black time crawled 
slowly. Mike Kerling knew the 
presence of his eyes. He was aware 
of the movements of eyeballs, the 
pressure of eyelids. Darkness still 
— but real darkness with real light 
beyond. Then came light — blind- 
ing pinwheels of red and orange, 
masked momentarily as eyelids 
blinked. 

Then a face. Bergan’s. 

What are you doing here, Ber- 
gan? Come to finish the job? 

Bergan’s lips moved. What was 
he saying? Mike could hear no 
sound. Fury stirred in him. And 
defiance. 

All right, make your play, 
Bergan. Get it over with . 

But the eyelids fell and again 
he knew darkness, silence and 
memories — one of them new. The 
silently speaking face of Bergan. 
The next time and the time

after that when the eyes opened 
Mike saw nothing but the pale 
gray walls of a room, a white 
sheet. He tried cautiously to move 
the eyes by his own will. The 
fire came again, worse than ever 
before. Leave well enough alone. 
Enjoy seeing. 

^ A white enameled night stand. 
A glass with some pink liquid in 
it. Hands, palm upward on a 
white blanket. One hand turning 
over. 

Not mine. They’ve given me 
someone else's hands. But I can 
feel my hand — somewhere else — 
doing something different. That’s 
Frankie Rionna’s hand, with the 
silver dollar tattooed on the back. 
I’ve got . hands . eyes . I’ve 
...he’s... RIONNA ’S GOT MY 
EYES! Oh, God... 

Understanding at last what had 
been done to him, Mike’s con- 
sciousness fled down an endless 
corridor. 

F our men sat around the 
carved rosewood desk in 
Harry Bergan’s downtown office. 
Bergan leaned back in a leather- 
covered swivel chair. Doc O’Byme 
sat in a matching piece a few 
feet away. Frankie Rionna occupied 
a straight chair. Piggy Butz another. 

In his strange world of liquid 
nitrogen Mike saw what Rionna 
saw — Bergan’s well-manicured 
hands and immaculate cheviot jack- 
et, O’Byrne’s face with an untidy 



string of pewter hair falling over 
a bloodshot eye. Piggy’s bulbous 
nose, heavy jowls and eyes sunk 
in rolls of fat, watching Rionna 
coldly. In that distant day when 
the scattering of Mike’s body had 
begun, Piggy and Rionna had been 
in the overtaking car. Piggy driv- 
ing. 

Mike made no attempt to con- 
trol the eyes Rionna was darting 
at Piggy or the others or to stop 
the maddening fidgeting of Doc’s 
right hand. Fiery pain and loom- 
ing eternity had conditioned him 
merely to watch. Even when Ber- 
gan slapped a newspaper down on 
the desk and jabbed a slim finger 
at a photo of John Kerling in 
his pulpit, he controlled all re- 
action. The paper’s headline read: 
PASTOR PROMISES EVI- 
DENCE SOON AGAINST UN- 
DERWORLD FIGURES. 

Bergan’s face was suave, im- 
passive. The manicured finger 
jabbed viciously as he spoke' to 
Rionna. There was death in the 
set of his mouth. 

Rionna made gestures of pro- 
test. He put his hands briefly to 
his eyes. Bergan’s poker face took 
on a tinge of disgust. He turned 
to Piggy. ' 

Piggy glanced down at the news 
photo, looked contemptuously at 
Rionna. Then, in a ripple of flab- 
by chins, he nodded once. 

The effort of following every 
move without the control of his 



58 



GALAXY 



eyes and without the use of his 
ears — as Piggy led Rionna and 
O’Byrne to a parked car in the 
street — was both terrifying and 
nauseating for Mike. But he re- 
sisted with every atom of his force 
the impulse to flee to the dark 
comforting cold. There was a mo- 
ment when Doc O’Byme would 
have turned away from the car 
but, braving the torment of fire, 
Mike set his hand firmly on the 
car’s door handle, forced him to 
enter. 

The car swung away from the 
curb and pulled up a few minutes 
later in front of John’s parish 
house. Rionna hurried to the back 
and Mike saw nothing but the 
alley until Piggy appeared at the 
back door, the housekeeper’s ter- 
rified face peering over his shoulder. 
The two men rejoined O’Byrne in 
the car and drove off in the direc- 
tion of the docks. 

When they pulled up behind 
an aged, parked car Mike recog- 
nized as John’s, Mike seized 
Rionna’s will and violently 
crossed his eyes. Rionna evidently 
made some outcry. Piggy slashed 
him fiercely across the face with 
the back of his hand. Mike felt 
the pain and his vision blanked 
out. This would not do. He must 
use the eyes to see what the trio 
intended to do. 

T he three found John in an alley 
between two deserted ware- 



houses. He was walking in the 
direction of a group of shacks on 
the edge of the river, carrying a 
paper grocery bag. When he heard 
the thugs behind him he turned 
and faced them calmly. Piggy 
showed tiny yellow teeth ifi a 
mirthless grin and slipped a straight 
razor out of his coat pocket. John’s 
face stiffened. He had always had 
an unreasonable fear of knives, 
even when he and Mike had been 
boys in school. But he held his 
ground. 

Don’t be a fool, John. Run, 
for God’s sake. Run — 

John whirled awkwardly, as if 
obeying. He dropped the bag, which 
burst at his feet. A large can 
rolled down the alley. Piggy 
snatched it up and hurled it wjth 
terrible force at the back of John’s 
head. John dropped to the ground, 
a bundle of twisted clothing and 
twitching limbs. 

Piggy stooped over the body 
and the razor in his hand flashed. 
It was then Mike wrenched Rion- 
na’s eyes around and fastened them 
on Piggy with an icy, frozen will. 
Rionna tried to turn away, then 
screamed and screamed. His gun 
was in his right hand. He tried 
once more to turn, then raised 
the gun and fired. The top of 
Piggy’s head exploded and he 
crashed over the body of his vic- 
tim, whose throat sprayed a foun- 
tain of blood. 

For a heartbeat O’Byrne, his 



GOD OF COOL 



59 



face blank, moved away from the 
welling blood. Then the muzzle of 
Rionna’s gun came up and fixed 
him with its vicious black eye. 

“You gotta do something, 
Doc. Come on, move. The Blessed 
Virgin’s on his side.” 

O’Byme started to say some- 
thing placating about superstition, 
then his right arm blazed in fiery 
agony and the words became a 
whimper. Hardly knowing what 
he was doing, he stumbled to the 
two bodies. Thrusting Piggy’s 
ruined head aside, he tore away 
John’s clerical collar and, with 
instruments from his coat pocket, 
went to work with more surety 
than he had ever known. As he 
finished stemming the flow of 
blood he raised his head and lis- 
tened. 

“Sirens— the fuzz. Come on, 
Rionna, let’s get out of here.” 
O’Byrne snatched his instru- 
ment case and ran. 

Rionna raised his arm hesitantly 
then placed the muzzle of the pistol 
between his oddly blue eyes. 

For Mike Kerling the darkness 
was a cool refuge. 

T he two white-swathed figures 
in Cryogenic Storage were no 
longer interns. One was a surgeon 



now, the other a neurologist. The 
eyes of the neurologist crinkled in 
a smile above his mask. 

“Our old friend C-15. Did you 
know C-15 and the Reverend Ker- 
ling were brothers?” 

“Yes. Twins, in fact. That’s 
why I picked him. The new tech- 
nique fortransplanting neural tissue 
needs all the help it can get, es- 
pecially for the motor center of 
a brain. So, with identical genes 



T he nurse was so stiff with 
starch she seemed brittle. The 
telephone was sooty black in her 
hands. 

“You said to call you. Doctor, 
when Reverend Kerling began to 
regain consciousness.” 

“That’s right. Nurse. Any 
mobility?” 

“Yes sir. He moved his right 
hand, opened his eyes and spoke.” 
“Speech as well? Splendid! 
What did he say?” 

“He looked as if he were meet- 
ing someone he knew. Then he 
said, ‘Yes, I found the envelope.’ 
Then he waited a little and said, 
‘In thy Father’s house there are 
many mansions. Welcome home.’ ”

Few would question randomness 
in the Big Bong. But Cytheron, 
olive scant eons, was too .young 
and reckless to give a damn! 



bob SHAW 



T he summons was far from 
welcome. 



Only that morning Cytheron 
had turned the world to glass. 
Not objectively, although he would 
one day reach the stage where it 
would have been possible, but sub- 



jectively— by modifying his vision 
to utilize neutrinos. He had at- 
tempted the same thing without 



success some centuries earlier. The 
memory of the previous failure was 
contributing to his present en- 
chantment because it made him 
aware of the processes of his own 
maturation. His body was trans- 
parent now, sensed only as an 
interaction of its elements with the 
mesons of the cosmic ray bom- 
bardment, moving across the face 



61 




of a crystal globe within which 
geological strata writhed like lum- 
inous vapors. 

Above him the sky was strange. 
His eyes could peer into the hearts 
of giant red suns, yet were aware 
of no other stars. He was exalted, 
inhaling reality and breathing it 
out as a liquescence of music, 
poetry and magic. 

A day, a year, a decade — all 
would have been as one in the 
new sensory configuration. But it 
seemed that only seconds had 
passed when the summons arrived, 
written on daylight, keyed to the 
singularities of his own cerebral 
rhythms so that no other denizen 
of this world could be aware of it 
except, perhaps, as an impression 
that a fleeting cloud had crossed 
the sun. Cytheron readjusted his 
eyes and found himself on a slop- 
ing plain where dry snow like 
flakes of amethyst swirled down 
from a green sky, not to lie dor- 
mant, but to flow and coalesce 
with the currents of invisible mag- 
netic rivers. Beyond the plain was 
a mountain range of milk-white 
rock, riven by fitfully fluorescing 
glaciers. 

He was able to orientate him- 
self by it. ' 

Cytheron reached outward wi'th 
his mind and skorded. In an in- 
stant he was standing on another 
plain far across the world, close 
to a group of eight elder thanii, 
members of his own species. There 



was no snow here— instead a warm 
amethyst rain paraded in regular 
curtains and broke in translucent 
archways above the group’s indi- 
vidual screens. A herd of indige- 
nous six-legged animals cropped 
the lacy grass all around. But so 
that the beasts would not be 
alarmed or disturbed in any way 
the thanii were permitting light 
to pass through their bodies. Cy- 
theron immediately adopted the 
same mode. 

/ answer your summons, he 
thought. fVhy did you call? 

You must know. The eight eld- 
ers thought as with one mind — 
a unison which never failed to fill 
Cytheron with dread. You have 
come of age, and the group mind 
is ready to receive you. 

But — Cytheron’s protest re- 
mained stillborn as he realized the 
truth of what was being said. He 
had come of age. A thousand 
years and more glimmered in his 
memory like a dissolving dream. 
I’m not ready. 

You are ready. The group voice 
was kind but inflexible. And we 
are ready for you. 

I have no doubt that you are 
prepared to receive me— but what 
shall I gain in exchange for my 
youth? 

Your racial heritage of experi- 
ence and wisdom. 

Which means I shall become 
old, doesn’t it, elder thanii? 

You cannot conceive what you 



62 



GALAXY 



shall become, Cytheron — and there 
lies the source of your apprehen- 
sion. You must have faith in the 
ways of our kind. You must believe 
that we know best — and now pre- 
pare to be assimilated. 

Never! 

Cytheron skorded as he formed 
the thought and at once he was 
haloed by amethyst flakes of des- 
sicated snow. The distant moun- 
tains wavered slightly. Then the 
thanii were with him again, in- 
vading his mind with cool tendrils. 
He cried aloud and skorded at 
random — brown riverbed darkly 
rolling, amber spires of an amber 
city sipping the morning sun, a 
blue forest’s introspective hush — 
but the elders held to him easily 
and his fear grew. 

A strange peacefulness bur- 
geoned within him. He knew a 
subtle loosening and realized he 
had almost surrendered his identity 
to the group, had almost yielded 
his individuality. His despair took 
him outward from the face of the 
planet. He paused briefly on the 
third moon but the shattered silver 
daggers of the horizon began to 
waver and he knew he had not 
escaped. Another leap — a giant 
world’s saffron sands under crim- 
son sky; leap — white hell, heart of 
moribund sun; leap — sentient hill 
of black Jelly shifting restlessly 
beneath alien stars. 

And all the time the elder 
thanii’s hold grew firmer. 



Cytheron experienced a single 
moment of insanity. Before fully 
understanding what he was doing 
he had skorded to the one place 
in that region of the galaxy where 
nobody— in his opinion not even 
the thanii — could reach him. 

H aving endured the fantastic 
death throes peculiar to its 
species, the quasar was at peace. 
The process of extinction had be- 
gun eons earlier, when the incredi- 
bly massive body exhausted its 
nuclear energy potential and start- 
ed collapsing radially. Density in- 
creased during the contraction un- 
til the attendant gravitic field 
became so fierce as to imprison 
all radiation and the quasar’s own 
light began to orbit around it. 
But the same contraction brought 
a spasmodic renewal of life: gravi- 
tational energies became available, 
wracking the still-vast sphere with 
explosions repeatedly pushing its 
radius back outside the limit where 
radiation can be trapped. 

For ten times a thousand years 
the quasar fluctuated between two 
diameters — one above and one be- 
low the critical dimension. Since 
there is no way of communicating 
with or receiving information from 
an object which imprisons its 
emanations, the quasar could be 
considered as periodically entering 
and leaving the normal continuum. 
Finally, however, even the fund of 
gravitic energy was depleted. The 



ELEMENT OF CHANCE 



63 



quasar folded the stuff of space- 
time in around itself &nA—phtt!—* 
vanished. 

Only a silent black hole of 
gravity marked its position in the 
stellar concourse. 

C ytheron realized the enormity 
of his mistake almost at once. 
The surface of the quasar was 
an inferno of introverted, recircu- 
lated energy — but the thanii had 
long ago learned the secret implicit 
in the universal truth that without 
resistance there can be no force 
and he was physically at ease. 
It was a short and relatively simple 
step from making his body trans- 
parent to light to allowing all 
forms of radiation pass through 
It unhindered. The concern he felt 
sprang from the discovery that he 
was trapped. 

His ability to skord was unim- 
paired but its effectiveness was 
canceled by the awesome distor- 
tions the quasar had wrought in 
the geometries of reality. Cytheron 
could skord any imaginable dis- 
tance — but only in a straight line— 
and in the vicinity of the dead 
quasar a straight line was a circle. 
He could reach any point on its 
surface instantaneously but he 
could conceive of no way to leave 
it. 

All at once, union with the 
elder thanii — so repugnant a short 
time earlier — seemed infinitely de- 
sirable. It came to Cytheron that 



he was little more than a child and 
had behaved with a child’s arro- 
gance and intolerance. The summit 
of his conceit had come when he 
had accused the elders of trying 
to take from him. In the anguish 
of selfknowledge he screamed — 
and came close to allowing the 
laminar flow of pent energy to 
scatter his body to the white winds 
of hell. 

Be calm, Cytheron, the elder 
thanii’s corporate thought said. 
That is not the way. 

You’ve found me. 

Cytheron was overwhelmed 
with relief as he turned and saw 
the group of eight, looking heart- 
eningly familiar and composed. 

It was not difficult. You have 
much to learn. 

I know, I know. He abased 
himself fervently. May I suggest 
that the first thing you show me 
is the method of skording through 
this barrier of gravity? I have no 
desire to remain here any longer. 

That is understandable — but 
there is no way to skord through 
such a barrier. 

What? Then I— all of us are 
trapped. 

That is not the case. We will 
destroy the barrier. 

The multiple thought of the 
elder thanii was calm and Cyther- 
on began to get his first real ink- 
ling of the magnitude of their 
combined intellect. 

But how can it be done? 



64 



GALAXY 



Part of the matter comprising 
this sphere must be reconstituted 
as antiparticles — the annihilation 
energy resulting will be sufficient 
to scatter its mass over a large 
volume of space, thus dispersing 
the gravitic field. 

You can do this? 

We can. The process has al- 
ready begun. 

The vastness of the opera- 
tion appalled Cytheron. It will 
be the equivalent of a nova, a su- 
pernova. Nearby star systems could 
be triggered off — worlds with life 
on them might be engulfed. I would 
pr^er not to be freed — to die rath- 
er than cause the death of another 
being. 

Do not be alarmed. We elders 
have lost none of our reverence 
for the counter-entropic force. Had 
freeing you meant the destruction 
of life, of even one individual, we 
would have been forced to leave 
you on this sphere. However, you 
were lucky. There will be the equiv- 
alent of a supernova but the only 
star close enough to be triggered 
off is without planets. 

But the cosmic ray bombard- 
ment, the neutron flux, is bound 
to flood the entire region. Will no 
inhabited worlds be affected? 

None. As we said, you have 
been very lucky, ^ Cytheron. We ex- 
amined all the stars in this neigh- 
borhood and have found only one 
solar system. It has nine evolving 
worlds — but is in a very early stage 



of development and life will not 
begin there until long after the 
violence of the explosion has 
abated. 

I see. I’m glad. 

Cytheron sought a way to ex- 
press his gratitude but all his 
powers of thought were lost tem- 
porarily as antimatter was created 
at the hands of the thanii and the 
outraged universe fell on itself 
in a blaze of attritive fury. 

T he elders had been correct in 
their analysis of his fears, Cy- 
theron realized. He had not been 
able to conceive what he would 
become after assimilation into the 
group mind. Nothing in his previ- 
ous state of separateness could 
have prepared him for the trans- 
lation into the adult state of being, 
its sense of completeness and be- 
longing, its transcendental peace! 
The sapience and experience of a 
thousand centuries surrounded him 
like a luminous cloud, modifying 
and yet at the same time establish- 
ing and reasserting his uniqueness. 

He paused briefly near a medi- 
um-sized sun with nine planets — 
the solar system closest to the 
stellar holocaust the thanii had 
engineered on his behalf. The sun 
and its retinue of nascent worlds 
swam undisturbed in the galactic 
tide, unaware of the cosmic storm 
approaching them at almost the 
speed of light. 

As you see, Cytheron, the 



ELEMENT OF CHANCE 



65 



group mind thought. There is no 
life here. The planetary masses 
are in an early stage of formation. 

I do see. He indicated a globe 
with an usually large moon, third 
from the sun. / imagine that this 
one will best approximate the opti- 
mum conditions for intelligent life. 

We agree. 

I must eventually return here, 
Cytheron thought. / can’t help 
feeling some curiosity about the 
way in which life will develop on 
this world. I also feel a certain 
responsibility. 

Responsibility? 

Yes. There is no life here yet 
but I dread the thought that the 
consequences of my behavior may 
have some adverse effect on its 
future course. After all, the very 
structure of the planet will be 
changed when it encounters the 



neutron flux from the supernova. 

You worry unduly, Cytheron, 
the group mind informed him with 
amusement tempered by its thou- 
sand centuries of wisdom. The 
only physical effect the explosion 
will have on this world is that there 
will be a high degree of neutron 
capture, leading to the formation 
of rather heavier elements than are 
normally found on a world of that 
type. 

As he sensed the elder thanii’s 
amusement and was drawn deeper 
into the group mind, Cytheron 
felt his unformed fears lessen and 
vanish. He could find nothing in 
that limitless fund of knowledge 
to suggest that the development 
of an intelligent species could be 
affected — in any noticeable way — 
by the 'presence of heavy metals, 
such as gold. Or uranium. •

Lieutenant Grimes was caught 
in a war of psyches, neither 
of them his own — or human . 



¥’M AFRAID, Lieutenant,” 
*said Commodore Damien, 
“that your passenger, this trip, 
won’t be able to help out in the 
galley.” 

“As long as he’s not another 
assassin, he’ll do for me,” said 



Grimes. “But I’ve found, sir, that 
anybody who likes to eat also 
likes, now and again, to prepare 
his own favorite dishes.” 

“This one does. All the time.” 
Grimes looked at his superior 
dubiously. He suspected the com- 



67 




tnodore’s sense of humor. The 
older man’s skull-like face was 
stiffly immobile but the pale gray 
eyes held a sardonic glint. 

“If he wants galley privileges, 
sir, it’s only fair that he shares, 
now and again, what he hashes 
up for himself.” 

Damien sighed. 

“I’ve never known officers so 
concerned about their bellies as 
you people in the Adder. All you 
think about is adding to your 
weight.” 

Grimes winced — as much be- 
cause of the unfairness of the im- 
putation as in reaction to the pun. 
The Couriers - small, fast ships - 
did not carry cooks, so their offi- 
cers, obliged to cook for them- 
selves, were more than usually 
food-conscious. Adder’s crew was 
no exception to this rule. 

Damien went on, “I’ve no 
doubt that Mr. Adam would be 
willing to share his — ah — nutri- 
ment with you. But I don’t think 
that any of you, catholic as your 
tastes may be, would find it palat- 
able. Or, come to that, nourishing. 
But who started this particularly 
futile discussion?” 

“You did, sir.” said Grimes. 
“You’ll never make a diplo- 
mat, Lieutenant. It is doubtful 
that you’ll ever reach flag rank in 
this service, rough and tough 
spacemen though we be, blunt and 
outspoken to a fault, the glint of 
honest iron showing through the 



work-worn fabric of our velvet 
gloves — ah — where was I?” 

“Talking about iron fists in 
velvet gloves, sir.” 

“Before you side-tracked me, 

I mean. Yes, your passenger. He 
is to be transported from Lindis- 
farne Base to Delacron. You just 
dump him there; then return to 
base forthwith.” The commodore’s 
bony hand picked up the heavily 
sealed envelope from his desk, ex- 
tended it. “Your orders.” 

“Thank you, sir. Will that be 
all, sir?” 

“Yes. Scramble!” 

G rimes did not exactly scram- 
ble. But he walked briskly 
enough to where his ship, the 
Serpent Class Courier Adder, was 
berthed. Dwarfed as she was by 
the bigger vessels about her, she 
still stood tall, proud and gleam- 
ing. Grimes knew that she and 
her kind were referred to, dispar- 
agingly, as “flying darning needles” 
but he loved the slenderness of her 
lines, would not have swapped 
her for a hulking Dreadnought. 
In a Dreadnought, of course -he 
constantly reminded himself— he 
would have been no more than 
one of many junior officers. Adder 
was his. 

Ensign Beadle, his First Lieu- 
tenant, met him at the airlock 
ramp, saluted. He reported mourn- 
fully— nobody had ever heard 
Beadle laugh and he smiled but 



68 



GALAXY 



rarely — “All secure for lift-off. 
Captain.” 

“Thank you. Number One.” 
“The passenger’s aboard.” 
“Good. I suppose we’d better 
extend the usual courtesy. Ask 
him if he’d like the spare seat in 
Control when we shake the dust 
of base off our tail vanes.” 

“I’ve already done so. Cap- 
tain. It says that it’ll be pleased 
to accept the invitation.” 

“It, Number One? It? Adam 
is a good Terran name.” 

Beadle actually smiled. 
“Technically speaking. Cap- 
tain, one could not say that Mr. 
Adam is of Terran birth. But he 
is of Terran manufacture.” 

“And what does he eat?” ask- 
ed Grimes, remembering the Com- 
modore’s veiled references to the 
passenger’s diet. “A.C. or D.C.? 
Washed down with a noggin of 
light lubricating oil?” 

“How did you guess. Cap- 
tain?” 

“The Old Man told me — in a 
roundabout sort of way. But — a 
passenger? Not cargo? There must 
be some mistake.” 

“No mistake. Captain. It’s in- 
telligent, all right, and it has a 
personality. I’ve checked its papers, 
and officially it’s a citizen of the 
Interstellar Federation, with all 
rights, privileges and obligations.” 
“I suppose our masters know 
best,” said Grimes resignedly. 

I T WAS intelligent and it had a 
personality. Grimes found it 
quite impossible to think of Mr. 
Adam as a machine. This robot 



was representative of a type of 
which Grimes had heard rumors 
but it was the first one that he had 
ever seen. Only a very few of its 
kind existed, in all the worlds of 
the Federation — and most of those 
few were on -Earth itself. To be- 
gin with, they were fantastically 
expensive. Secondly, their creators 
were scared of them, were plagued 
by nightmares in which they saw 
themselves as latter-day Franken- 
steins. Intelligent robots were not 
a rarity — but intelligent robots 
with imagination, intuition and in- 
itiative were. They had been de- 
veloped mainly for research and 
exploration and could survive in 
environments that would be al- 
most immediately lethal to even 
the most heavily and elaborately 
equipped man. 

Mr. Adam sat in the spare 
chair in the control room. He had 
no need at all to sit but he did 
so — in an astonishingly human 
posture. Perhaps, thought Grimes, 
he could sense that his hosts would 
feel more comfortable if something 
that looked like an attenuated 
knight in armor were not looming 
tall behind them, peering over their 
shoulders. His face was expres- 
sionless. It was a dully gleaming 
ovoid without features. But it 
seemed to Grimes that there was 
the faintest flicker of luminosity 
behind the eye lenses that could 
betoken interest. His voice, when 
he spoke, came from a diaphragm 
set in his throat. 

He was speaking now. 

“This has been very interest- 
ing, Captain. And now, I take it. 



THE SOULMACHINE

we are on trajectory for Dela- 
cron.” 

The voice was a pleasant bari- 
tone, not quite mechanical. 

“Yes, Mr. Adam. That is the 
Delacron sun there — at three 
o’clock from the center of the 
cartwheel sight.” 

“And that odd distortion, of 
course, is the resultant of the tem- 
poral precession field of your 
Drive—” Adam hummed quietly 
to himself for several seconds. “In- 
teresting.” 

“You must have seen the same 
sort of thing on your way out to 
Lindisfarne from Earth.” 

“No, Captain. I was not a 
guest, ever, in the control room 
of the cruiser in which I was trans- 
ported.” The shrug of his gleam- 
ing metal shoulders was almost 
human. “I — I don’t think Captain 
Grigsby trusted me.” 

That, thought Grimes, was 
rather an odd way of putting what 
he himself felt. But he knew Grigs- 
by, had served under him. Grigs- 
by, as a naval officer of an earlier 
age on Earth’s seas, would have 
pined for the good old days of 
sail, of wooden ships and iron 
men — and by “iron men” he 
would not have meant anything 
like this Mr. Adam. 

“Yes,” the robot went on mus- 
ingly, “I find this not only interest- 
ing, but amazing.” 

“How so?” asked Grimes. 

“It could all be done — the lift- 
off, the setting of trajectory, the 
delicate balance between accelera- 
tion and temporal precession — so 
much faster by one like myself.” 



You mean “better” rather than 
“faster” but you’re too courteous 
to say it. 

“You’re flesh and blood crea- 
tures, Captain, evolved to suit the 
conditions of just one world out of 
all the billions of planets. Space 
is not your natural environment.” 

“We carry our environment 
around with us, Mr. Adam.” 
Grimes noticed that the other of- 
ficers in Control— Ensign von Tan- 
nenbaum. Navigator; Ensign 
Beadle, First Lieutenant; Lieuten- 
ant Slovotny, Radio Officer— were 
following the conversation’closely 
and expectantly. He would have 
to. be careful. Nonetheless, he had 
to keep up his end. He grinned. 
“And don’t forget,” he said, 
“that Man, himself, is a quite 
rugged, self-maintaining, self-re- 
producing, all-purpose robot.” 

“There are more ways than 
one of reproducing,” said Mr. 
Adam quietly. 

“I’ll settle for the old-fashioned 
way,” broke in von Tannenbaum. 

Grimes glared at the burly, 
flaxen-headed young man — but 
too late to stop Slovotny’s laugh- 
ter. Even Beadle smiled. 

John Grimes allowed himself 
a severely rationed chuckle. 

Then: “The show’s on the 
road, gentlemen. I’ll leave her in 
your capable hands. Number One. 
Set Deep Space watches. Mr. 
Adam, it is usual at this juncture 
for me to invite any guests to my 
quarters for a drink and a yarn—” 

Mr. Adam laughed. 

“Like yourself. Captain, I feel 
the occasional need for a lubri- 



70 



GALAXY 



cant. But I do not make a ritual 
of its application. I shall, however, 
be very pleased to talk with you 
while you drink.” 

“I’ll lead the way,” said 
Grimes resignedly. 



I N A small ship passengers can 
make their contribution to the 
quiet pleasures of the voyage — or 
they can be a pain in the neck. 
Mr. Adam, at first, seemed pathet- 
ically eager to prove that he could 
be a good shipmate. He could 
talk — and he did talk on anything 
and everything. Mr. Beadle re- 
marked about him that he must 
have swallowed an encyclopedia. 
Mr. McCloud, the engineering of- 
ficer, corrected this statement, say- 
ing that he must have been built 
around one. And Mr. Adam could 
listen. That was worse than his 
talking — Grimes had the impres- 
sion of invisible wheels whirring 
inside that featureless head, of 
information either being discarded 
as valueless or added to the robot’s 
data bank. He could play chess, 
of course — and on the rare oc- 
casions when he lost a game it 
was strongly suspected that he had 
done so out of politeness. It was 
the same with any card game. 

Grimes sent for Spooky Deane, 
the Psionic Communications Of- 
ficer. He had the bottle and the 
glasses ready when the tall, fragile 
young man seeped in through the 
doorway of his day cabin, looking 
like a wisp of ectoplasm decked 
out in Survey Service uniform. He 
sat down when invited, accepted 



the tumbler of neat gin that his 
captain obligingly poured for him. 

“Here’s looking up your kilt,” 
toasted Grimes coarsely. 

“A physical violation of pri- 
vacy, Captain,” murmured Deane. 
“I see nothing objectionable in 
that.” 

“And just what are you hint- 
ing at, Mr. Deane?” 

“I know. Captain, that you 
are about to ask me to break the 
Rhine Institute’s Privacy Oath. 
And this knowledge has nothing 
to do with my being a telepath. 
Every time we carry passengers 
it’s the same. You always want 
me to pry into their minds to see 
what makes them tick.” 

“Only when I feel that the 
safety of the ship might be at 
stake.” 

Grimes refilled Deane’s glass, 
the contents of which had some- 
how vanished. 

“Are you frightened of our 
passenger?” 

Grimes frowned. Frightened 
was a strong word. And yet man- 
kind has always feared the robot, 
the automation, the artificial man. 
A premonitory dread? Or was the 
robot only a symbol of the ma- 
chines— the mindless machines 
that every year were becoming 
more dominant in human affairs? 

Deane said quietly, “Mr. 
Adam is not a mindless machine.” 

Grimes glared at him. He al- 
most snarled. How the hell do you 
know what I’m thinking? 

The query died unuttered. Not 



THE SOULMACHINE 



71 



that it made any difference. 

The telepath went on, “Mr. 
Adam has a mind as well as a 
brain.” 

“That’s what I was wonder- 
ing.” 

“Yes. He broadcasts, Captain, 
as all of you do. The trouble is 
that I haven’t quite got his -fre- 
quency.” 

“Any hostility toward hu- 
mans?” 

Deane extended his empty 
glass. Grimes refilled it. The tele- 
path sipped daintily. 

Grimes said, “I don’t think 
so. But his mind is not human. 
Does he feel contempt? Not quite. 
Pity? Yes, it could be. A sort of 
amused affection? That’s it.” 

“The sort of feelings that we’d 
exhibit for — say, a dog capable 
of coherent speech?” 

“Yes.” 

“Anything else?” 

“I could be wrong. Captain. 

I most probably am. This is the 
first time that I’ve eavesdropped 
on a nonorganic mind. Adam 
seems to emit a strong sense of 
mission.” 

“Mission?” 

“Yes. The pattern reminds me 
of that priest we carried a few 
trips back — the one who was 
going out to convert the heathen 
Tarvarkens.” 

“A dirty business,” comment- 
ed Grimes. “Wean the natives 
away from their own and quite 



satisfactory local gods — so that 
they stop lobbing missiles at the 
trading post.” 

“Father Cleary didn’t look at 
it that way.” 

“Good for him. I wonder what 
happened to the poor bastard?” 
“Should you be talking like 
this. Captain?” 

“No. But with you what I 
say doesn’t matter. You know 
what I’m thinking, anyhow. But 
this Mr. Adam, Spooky. A mis- 
sionary? It doesn’t make sense.” 
“That’s just the feeling I get. 
I’m not trying to make sense.” 
“All right. Perhaps you do 
make sense. The robots of Adam’s 
class are designed to be able to go 
where Man himself cannot go. In 
our own planetary system, for ex- 
ample, they’ve carried out explor- 
ations on Mercury, Jupiter and 
Saturn. A robot missionary on 
Tarvark would have made sense, 
being impervious to poisoned ar- 
rows, spears and the like. But 
on Delacron, an Earth colony? 
Why?” 

“The feeling I have doesn’t 
extend beyond Adam.” 

“There are feelings and feel- 
ings,” Grimes told him. “This is 
a nonorganic mind that you’re 
prying into. Perhaps you don’t 
know the code, the language - 
the answer has to have been built 
into him.” 

“Codes and languages don’t 
matter to a telepath.” Deane con- 



72 



GALAXY 



trived to make his empty glass 
obvious. Grimes refilled it. “Don’t 
forget. Captain, that there are ma- 
chines on Delacron — intelligent 
machines. They don’t show a very 
high order of intelligence, I ad- 
mit. But you must have heard 
of the squabble between Delacron 
and its nearest neighbor, Mul- 
doon — ” 

Spooky let the thought dangle. 

Grimes had heard of the trou- 
ble. Roughly midway between the 
two planetary systems was a sun 
with only one world in close orbit 
about it. The solitary planet was 
a fantastic treasurehouse of radio- 
active ores. Both Delacron and 
Muldoon had laid claim 4o it. 
Delacron wanted the rare metals 
for its own industries, the less 
highly industrialized Muldoon 
wanted them for export to other 
worlds of the Federation. 

And Mr. Adam? Where did 
he come into it? Officially, ac- 
cording to his papers, he was a 
programmer, on loan from the 
Federation’s Grand Council to the 
Government of Delacron. A pro- 
grammer was a teacher of ma- 
chines. An intelligent machine to 
teach other intelligent machines? 
To teach other intelligent ma- 
chines what? 

And who had programmed 
Adam? Or had he^imply, as it 
were, happened? 

A familiar pattern — vague, in- 
distinct — was beginning to emerge. 



It had all been done before, this 
shipping of revolutionaries into 
places where they could do the 
most harm by governments abso- 
lutely unsympathetic toward local 
aspirations. 

“Even if Mr. Adam had a 
beard,” said Deane, “he wouldn’t 
look much like Lenin.” 

And Grimes wondered if the 
driver who brought that train into 
the Finland Station knew what he 
was doing. 

G rimes was merely the engine 
driver. Mr. Adam was the 
passenger, and Grimes was tied 
down as much by the Regulations 
of his Service as was that long-ago 
railwayman by the tracks upon 
which his locomotive ran. Grimes 
was blessed — or cursed — with 
both imagination and a conscience. 
And a conscience is too expensive 
a luxury for a junior officer. 

Grimes actually wished that in 
some way Mr. Adam were en- 
dangering the ship. Then he. 
Grimes, could take action, drastic 
action if necessary. But the robot 
was less trouble than the average 
human passenger. Adam made no 
complaints about monotonous 
food, stale air and all the rest of 
it. About the only thing that could 
be said against him was that he 
was far too good a chess player. 
But just about the time Grimes 
began to find excuses for not play- 
ing with him, Adam made what 



THE SOULMACHINE 



73 



appeared to be a genuine friend- 
ship. He began to prefer the com- 
pany of Mr. McCloud to that of 
any of the other officers. 

“Of course, Captain,” said 
Beadle, “they belong to the same 
clan.” 

“What the hell do you mean. 
Number One?” 

Deadpan, Beadle replied, “The 
Clan MacHinery.” 

Grimes groaned, then, reluc- 
tantly laughed. 

He said, “It makes sense. A 
machine will have more in com- 
mon with an engineer than with 
the rest of us. Their shop talk 
must be fascinating.” He tried to 
imitate McCloud’s accent. “An’ 
tell me, Mr. Adam, whit sorrt o’ 
lubricant d’ye use on yon ankle 
joint?” 

Beadle, having made his own 
joke, was not visibly amused. 

“Something suitable for heavy 
duty I should imagine. Captain.” 
“Mphm. Well, he’s out of our 
hair for the rest of the trip if 
Mac keeps him happy.” 

“He’ll keep Mac happy, too. 
Captain. He’s always moaning 
that he should have an assistant. 

“Set a thief to catch a thief,” 
cracked Grimes. “Set a machine 
to — what?” 

“Work a machine?” 

Those words would do, thought 
Grimes. But after Beadle had left 
him he began to consider the im- 
plications of what had been dis- 



cussed. McCloud was a good en- 
gineer-but the better the engineer, 
the worse the psychological short- 
comings. The machine had been 
developed to be Man’s slave but 
ever since the twentieth century a 
peculiar breed of Man had prolif- 
erated — a species all too ready 
and willing to become the ma- 
chine’s servants, far too prone to 
sacrifice human values on the altar 
of efficiency. 

Instead of machines’ being 
modified to suit their operators, 
men were being modified to suit 
the machines. And McCloud? He 
would have been happier in in- 
dustry than in the Survey Service, 
with its emphasis on officer-like 
qualities and all the rest of it. As 
it was, he was far too prone to 
regard the ship merely as the plat- 
form that carried his precious en- 
gines. 

Grimes sighed. He did not like 
what he was going to do. It was 
all very well to snoop on passen- 
gers, on outsiders — but to pry 
into the minds of his own people 
was not gentlemanly. 

He got out the gin bottle and 
called for Mr. Deane. 

Y es, Captain?” asked the tele- 
path. 

“You know what I want you 
for. Spooky.” 

“Of course. But I don’t like 
it.’,’ 

“Neither do I.”

GALAXY 



Grimes poured the drinks, 
handed the larger one to Deane. 
The Psionic Communications Of- 
ficer sipped in an absurdly genteel 
manner, the little finger of his 
right hand extended. The level of 
the transparent fluid in his glass 
sank rapidly. 

Deane asked, his speech ever 
so slightly slurred, “And you think 
that the safety of the ship is jeop- 
ardized?” 

“I do.” 

Grimes poured more gin. But 
not for himself. 

“If I have your assurance. Cap- 
tain, that such is the case.” 

“You have.” 

Deane was silent for a few 
seconds. He seemed to be looking 
through rather than at Grimes, 
staring at something — elsewhere. 

Then: “They’re in the com- 
puter room. Mr. Adam and the 
Chief. I can’t pick up Adam’s 
thoughts but I feel a sense of — 
rightness? I can get into Mac’s 
mind ... ” The grimace of extreme 
distaste was startling on Deane’s 
featureless visage. “I don’t under- 
stand.” 

“You don’t understand what. 
Spooky?” 

“How a man, a human being, 
can regard a hunk of animated 
ironmongery with such reverence.” 

“You’re not a very good psy- 
chologist, Spooky, but go on.” 

“I’m looking at Adam through 
Mac’s eyes. He’s bigger, somehow. 



and he seems to be self-luminous. 
There’s a sort of circle of golden 
light around his head.” 

“That’s the way that Mac sees 
him?” 

“Yes. And his voice. Adam’s 
voice. It’s not the way that we 
hear it. It’s more like the beat of 
some great engine. And he’s say- 
ing, ‘You believe and you will 
serve.’ And Mac has just answer- 
ed, ‘Yes, Master. I believe and I 
will serve.’ ” 

“What are they doing?” Grimes 
demanded urgently. 

“Mac’s opening up the com- 
puter. The memory bank, I think 
it is. He’s turned to look at Adam 
again. A panel over Adam’s chest 
is sliding away and down. I see 
some sort of storage bin in there — 
rows and rows of pigeonholes. 
Adam has taken something out of 
one of them — a ball of grayish 
metal or plastic, with connections 
all over its surface. He’s telling 
Mac where to put it in the mem- 
ory bank and how to hook it up.” 

Grimes, his glass clattering un- 
heeded to the deck, was out of his 
chair. He paused briefly at his 
desk to snatch open a drawer and 
take from it his .50 automatic. 
He snapped at Deane, “Get on the 
intercom. Tell every officer off 
duty to come to the computer 
room, armed if possible.” He ran 
through the door out into the 
alleyway, then fell rather than 
clambered down the ladder to the 



THE SOULMACHINE

next deck — the next one and the 
next. At some stage of his descent 
he twisted his ankle painfully but 
kept on going. 

The door to the computer room 
was locked from the inside but 
Grimes, as Captain, carried always 
on his person the ship’s master 
key. With his left hand - the pistol 
was in his right — he inserted the 
convoluted sliver of metal into 
the slot, twisted it. The panel slid 
open. 

McCloud and Adam stared at 
him, at the weapon in his hand. 
He stared back. He allowed his 
gaze to wander, but briefly. The 
cover plate had been replaced over 
the memory bank — but surely that 
heavily insulated cable leading to 
and through it was something that 
had been added, was an addition- 
al supply of power, too much 
power, to the ship’s electronic 
bookkeeper. 

McCloud smiled — a vague sort 
of smile, yet somehow exalted, 
that looked odd on his rough- 
hewn features. 

He said, “You and your kind 
are finished. Captain. You’d bet- 
ter tell the dinosaurs. Neanderthal 
Man, the dodo, the great auk and 
all the others to move over to 
make room for you.” 

“Mr. McCloud,” Grimes said, 
his voice— not without effort on 
his part — steady. “Switch off the 
computer. Then undo whatever it 
is that you have done.” 



It was Adam who replied: “I 
am sorry, genuinely sorry, Mr. 
Grimes, but it is too late. As Mr. 
McCloud implied, you are on the 
point of becoming extinct.” 

Grimes was conscious of the 
others behind him in the alley- 
way. 

“Mr. Beadle?” 

“Yes, Captain?” 

“Take Mr. Slovotny with you 
down to the engine room. Cut 
off all power to this section of 
the ship.” 

“You can try,” said Mr. 
Adam. “But you will not be al- 
lowed. I give notice now — I am 
the Master.” 

“You are the Master,” echoed 
McCloud. 

“Mutiny,” stated Grimes. 

“Mutiny?” repeated Adam, 
iron and irony in his voice. 

He stepped towards the cap- 
tain, one long, metallic arm up- 
raised. 

Grimes fired. He might as well 
have been using a peashooter. He 
fired again and again. The bullets 
splashed like pellets of wet clay 
on the robot’s armor. Grimes re- 
alized that it was too late for him 
to turn and run. He awaited the 
crushing impact of the steel fist 
that would end everything. 

A voice said, “No — no — ” 

Was it his own? Dimly, he 
realized that it was not. 

The voice came again: “No — ” 

Adam hesitated - but only for 



76 



GALAXY 



a second. Again he advanced. And 
then, seemingly from the comput- 
er itself, arced a crackling dis- 
charge, a dreadful, blinding light- 
ning. Grimes, in the fleeting instant 
before his eyelids snapped shut, 
saw the automaton standing there, 
arms outstretched rigidly from his 
sides, black amid the electric fire 
that played about his body. He 
toppled to the deck, making a 
metallic crash. 

When, at long last. Grimes 
regained his eyesight he looked 
around the computer room. Mc- 
Cloud was unharmed — physically. 
The engineer huddled in a corner, 
his arms over his head, in a foetal 
position. The computer, to judge 
from the wisps of smoke still trick- 
ling from cracks in its panels, was 
a total write-off. And Adam, liter- 
ally welded to the deck, still in 
that attitude of crucifixion, was 
dead. 



Dead? thought Grimes numbly. 
Dead? Had Adam ever lived in 
the real sense of the word? 

But the ship, he knew, had 
been briefly alive, had been aware, 
conscious, after that machine who 
would be God had kindled the 
spark of life in her electronic brain. 
And a ship, unlike other machines, 
always has personality, a pseudo- 
life derived from her crew, from 
the men who live and work, hope 
and dream within her stalwart metal 
body. 

This vessel had known her brief 
minutes of full awareness — but her 
old virtues had persisted, among 
them loyalty to her rightful des- 
tiny. 

Grimes wondered if he would 
dare to put all this in the report 
that he would have to make. It 
would be a pity not to give credit 
where credit was due.

Is 300 feet large enough to be

mine Roche’s limit? Scientists 
don’t know, but they suspect not. 

And if not — then what was the 
original object, and what in the 
world — or out of the world, more 
likely, made it break up on De- 
cember 18, 1955? 



Of course, we are not suggest-

probe, charged with the observa- 
tion of Earth on behalf of the citi- 
zens of Alpha Centauri VIII, at 
that date split itself into ten or a 
dozen exploration modules. We 
wouldn’t suggest anything. 

But it’s kind of interesting to

At odds of a

everything is fair-

a stranger's life! 



R esting his front pair of legs, 
the Referee silently listened to 
Therdon air his rage. Therdon 
called up images of every ancestor 
in Arman’s nest and drove them 
forth with wild invective. Arman 
stroked his aphid absently and 
slowly sucked the cool ooze from 
its back. Eventually Therdon tired 
and fell silent. 

Passing the equivalent of a sigh. 



GEORGE C. WILLICK 

the Referee restated his position 
for the hundredth time. 

“There are no rules that force 
an opponent to resign from the 
game. The Referee may only call 
a game where both Movers claim 
victory upon the death of a Player. 
Beyond this I am not allowed to 
interfere in any way with the play.” 
Therdon sulked behind a black- 
ening silence. Arman should have 



78 



been the one who was disturbed, 
for he was losing the game. The 
game was in its forty- second year 
and Arman should have resigned 
twenty years ago. But he had 
another hunch and, like ail gamblers 
who heed hunches, he knew the 
next one was the winner. Arman 
'needed another foul and Therdon 
was in the mood to commit one 
very soon. 

•J'HOMAS GREEN and Adam 
^ Heitz were created on the same 
day forty-two years ago and placed 
into- human environmental circum- 
stances that were relatively equal. 
Both Players were given the same 
mental and physical qualities and 
the nonplaying humans with whom 
they wereplaced had acquired about 
the same amount of wealth and 
social bearing. From this point on 
the Mover, Arman, was responsible 
for Adam Heitz and Therdon was 
responsible for the Player Thomas 
Green. 

And from this point on the 
game was never even. 

The people who knew Thomas 
Green swore he was silverspoon 
and could do no wrong. Every- 
thing he touched seemed to flourish 
and turn into gold. He had built 
his father’s small grocery store on 
the lower East Side into a multi- 
million dollar produce distributing 
company. The occasional incidents 
of trouble fate visited upon him 



were always ended to his satisfac- 
tion and success. 

He lived on Long Island, on one 
of those exclusive estates at the 
end of a private lane that connected 
to a semiprivate, paved road. Thirty 
rooms of house and forty acres of 
lawn overlooked a private inlet and 
marina. The house itself was accept- 
ably horrible in a French Gothic/ 
Early American sort of way. The 
building inspired Green and he 
delighted in decorating with Span- 
ish Mediterranean furniture, Per- 
sian rugs and modern art. 

His children by several mar- 
riages were plac^ in the best 
schools in Massachusetts. His pres- 
ent wife was twenty-four years old 
and had been recruited from the 
dancers in one of his downtown 
clubs. She was ravingly beautiful, 
polished and completely paid for. 

Green was listed in Who’s Who 
and considered to be governor tim- 
ber by the right party. His appear- 
ance was unusually youthful. His 
thinning hair maintained its original 
line and his figure was kept trim 
by bouts on the tennis court with 
his mistresses. He played handball, 
polo and sailed alone from his 
private marina on deep-sea fishing 
ventures. 

But his friends, of which he 
had many, were starting to show 
concern over his often eccentric 
behavior. He would go into fits of 
rage that always ended up with his 
nearly killing himself on some fast- 



79 



moving machinery. A psychiatrist 
had been moved quietly into the 
circle but could find nothing wrong 
with Green. 

What Thomas Green did not 
have he did not want. What he 
did not do he had done brfore or 
did not care to do. For forty-two 
years he had silently wondered 
when it would all end but it never 
did and be began to know that only 
death would stop it. 

A rman felt a wash of content- 
ment as Therdon finished with a 
flourish his series of moves. 

“Foul,” he claimed. The Ref- 
eree bent forward to study the 
board while Therdon exploded in 
a flurry of oaths and wriggling 
obscenities. Arman watched his op- 
ponent with a certain amount of 
pity. He had withheld victory from 
Therdon for twenty years and the 
win would have allowed his op- 
ponent to take his seat among the 
Elder Workers. Frustration had 
caused Therdon to play carelessly 
and this foul was the final one. 

After several moments the Ref- 
eree returned to his former position 
and stated, “The claim of Foul is 
allowed in this” case by reason of a 
violation of rule four-fifteen, which 
provides that no Mover may use 
his Player in such a way as to 
endanger the life of a nonplayer, 
directly or indirectly. I therefore 
decree that the penalty of a for- 



feited turn is incurred by the Mover 
Therdon.” 

Arman bowed in acknowledg- 
ment to the award. 

He said, “The Mover Arman 
declines the penalty by reason of 
exercising his right to invoke Er- 
salz’s rule.” 

S ensible people avoided Adam 
Heitz as they would a black 
cat. Adam was a first-class loser. 
If he touched a machine it would 
break. If he bought fruit at the 
street stand it would be rotten or 
wormy. If he got on an elevator he 
sneezed three times. He had been 
sued once for trespassing while 
trying to complain about a dog 
bite. He tried to help a lady across 
a busy intersection and she broke 
her ankle slipping off the curb. 

Adam lived in South Philadel- 
phia on the fifth story of a walk- 
up overlooking the rail yards. His 
wife weighed two hundred pounds 
and had been his cousin when 
they were forced to get married. 
They had six kids and had not 
touched each other in more than 
three years. The children slept 
with their mother in the one bed- 
room while Adam stayed on the 
couch where his asthmatic coughing 
would not bother anyone. 

After his release from the re- 
formatory Adam had sold his 
father’s dry-goods business and 
used the money to pay off gambling 



80 



GALAXY 



debts. He had managed to keep 
enough money to buy an old gar- 
bage truck and eked out a living 
from a minor downtown route 
that no one else bothered with. 

The apartment was decorated 
in early nineteen-forties graffiti and 
broken by plaster holes to offset 
the falling ceiling strips. Adam 
spent most of his time lounging 
before the TV in his shorts and 
T-shirt and drinking warm beer. 
He had trained himself to hear the 
set’s speakers without distortion 
from his wife’s constant nagging 
and the children’s screaming. 

Heitz had been a hunch player 
all his life and had somehow man- 
aged to lose on every one. He had 
wanted to give up ages ago, as 
his hair and stomach had done, 
but something drove him on. May- 
be prosperity was right around the 
corner in the next garbage can. 
Maybe the next hunch would cop 
the Irish Sweepstakes. Maybe. 



fflHE game chamber was almost 
A empty of sound after Arman’s 
announcement. Even the preening 
aphids stood still. Suddenly the 
Referee busied himself counting the 
allowed claims of foul to ascertain 
that the proper number had been 
committ^. Therdon, whose fea- 
tures had contorted during the 
pause, swallowed and grinned, then 
finally laughed in tremendous relief. 



“It’s finally over.” 

Arman agreed, “Yes, in one 
way or another.” 

“You can’t be serious. The 
odds are a million to one,” Ther- 
don said. 

“Exactly,” nodded Arman. 

The Referee spoke, “The count 
of the Mover Arman is correct, as 
twenty-five claims of foul have been 
allowed. Rule three-o-one, sub- 
section three, states that any Mover 
against whom twenty-five or more 
fouls have been committed may 
exercise rule three hundred. Rule 
three hundred, popularly known as 
Ersalz’s Rule, states that a Mover 
may call for the Rotater in an at- 
tempt to reverse the positions of 
the Players in respect to theirphys- 
ical environment. If the petitioning 
Mover is successful the game will 
continue. If unsuccessful, the game 
is terminated. Do both Movers 
understand the situation?” 

“We understand,” they an- 
swered formally. 

The Rotater was rolled out by 
several slaves and moved into posi- 
tion beside the Referee. Therdon 
felt like a participant in a pistol 
duel who is forced to stand fire 
from a blind man. It wasn’t likely 
he would be hit but there was still 
that chance, that one chance in a 
million. The Rotater was a make- 
shift device of sixteen variously 
sized wheels aligned on a common 
shaft. Each wheel had different 



ERSAL'S RULE 



81 



combinations of red and white 
marks on the circumference and 
a marking line ran horizontally 
across the face of all wheels. 

With a kick of his 1^ the 
Referee tripped the spring clamp 
and all the wheels spun into a 
pinkish motion. Arman felt that 
hunch with all his being. It would 
work this time. He would win. 
All white or all red — either would 
win. It had only happened once 
and that was over two thousand 
years ago, when Ersalz did it. The 
first wheel slowed to a stop on 
white. Ersalz had won on red. 

Often, without either’s being 
^ aware of the coincidence, both 
Players would do their basic chores 
together — eating or sleeping or 
working. At the moment they were 
shaving. Adam was waving his 
straightedge back and forth across 
the strap in a vain effort to hone 
the steel. A nick under his chin 
bled profusely as he watched his 
face freeze up in the peeling mirror. 
He lifted the razor, gritted his 
teeth and took the stroke. 

Thomas admired himself before 
his bronze-trimmed mirror as the 
sounds of his electric razor echoed 
off the marble walls of the bath- 
room. He liked to shave in the 
nude and his tanned body attested 
to the fact that he enjoyed swim- 
ming that way, too. He could hear 
his wife washing in her own bath 
and let his mind dwell on the 



image as he worked the razor 
about his jaw. 

T he last wheel slowed and stop- 
ped on white — sixteen in a 
row. Therdon’s confident grin was 
gone, replaced by an indescribable 
expression. Arman felt something 
crawl in his mind and he wanted 
to scream. The Referee flicked the 
lock on the Rotater to set the 
machine for validation. 

Then, calmly, the Referee or- 
dered the switch of environments. 

A dam jerked back as the elec- 
tric razor touched his face. He 
slammed it violently down into the 
sink, where it shattered and flew 
into pieces about the room. He 
most have screamed then, because 
after a while his wife, Thomas’s 
wife, came running. She found him 
with one hand touching the mirror 
while the other was exploring his 
body. She ran to him and just held 
on, a woman’s sense telling her this 
was all that was needed. 

Adam knew it was a dream. He 
did not understand how it could 
happen this way but he knew it 
was a dream. Tingling chills run- 
ning through him from the body 
contact of the woman made him 
urgently aware that he had better 
get on with it before he awoke. 

Thomas was not as fortunate. 
He laid open his face with the 
straight razor. As he jerked back 
to see what had happened his 
eyes focused for the last time as 



82 



GALAXY 



a sane man. He screamed, too, but 
he did not stop screaming. He 
ran from the bathroom, stumbling 
about until he found the door that 
led into the hallway. Then he 
charged down the stairs to the 
street, wearing only a towel about 
his waist and dripping blood from 
his arms and chest. 

Thomas Green ran in circles in 
front of the apartment house, sim- 
ply screaming and waving his blood- 
stained razor. Women were fainting 
in little heaps here and there and 
finally a policeman arrived. He 
could only analyze what he saw and 
no one blamed him later for draw- 
ing his gun and trying to disable 
the beserk citizen. But Thomas 
had, at long last, inherited Adam’s 
luck and the single bullet caught 



him through the heart. He fell 
dead across a garbage can, Adam’s 
can. 

A rman stared at the board in 
disbelief. The Players had been 
beyond the control of the Movers. 
His Player was alive and the obvi- 
ous winner. Minutes ago he was 
the worst loser to ever disgrace the 
games. It was fantastic, unbeliev- 
able. 

“Unfair,” said Therdon in 
tears, “It’s unfair- unfair!” 

Arman wanted to agree but 
could find no words. 

The Referee regarded Therdon 
coolly. 

“My dear_ Mover,” he said. 
“At odds of a million to one, 
everything is fair.” ^

W ATER to a reluctant sponge, 
consciousness seeped impla- 
cably into the brain, mind, soul 
and person of Amos A, Appleby. 
It was like an incoming tide lap- 
ping around a child’s sand castle, 
abandoned on the beach because 
the time had become cold and dark 
and everyone had gone back to the 
hotel, leaving behind, along with 
the castle, the odd yellow bucket 
and red shovel, tools of wanton, 
unformed engineers. Consciousness 
was now one of the lesser desires 
of Amos Appleby. A look into his 



ERNEST KEITH TAVES 

unconscious would find some am- 
bivalence about His ever wanting 
to be conscious again. 

Let me sleep just one -week 
more. 

But the tide takes away the 
turrets and in the end you wake 
and see how.it is, where you are. 
Baby, you say, this is it. 

Amos Appleby, fighting the 
opening of his eyes, called forth 
the memory, imagery, thought of 



84 



GALAXY 



the girl at his side a million or two 
years ago, her flesh against his, 
the world outside the way it had 
been for a while, with orange 
juice and croissants and coffee for 
breakfast, they in robes of many 
but familiar colors. 

Her flesh against his, yes, the 
warmth of her skin on his. Dp 
you remember knowing this touch 
for the first time— what it was, how 
it felt? You have thought of this? 
All right, then, cancel all that. 
Think you might never know it 
again, not ever. 

Amos fought. But you can 
sleep only so long, no matter how 
seductive or urgent the prospect. 
Amos opened his eyes. 

S AND the hell all over, dunes, 
and no oasis in sight. Sport 
jacket for a pillow and no blanket. 
The night before when he had 
(what do you say — landed, ar- 
rived?) come here, the stars had 
confirmed, roughly, his idea of 
where he was. And what they had 
suggested about the when hadn’t 
been too bad. He had been worse 
off before. The where had to be 
the expanse of nothing called the 
Sahara — and the when seemed 
within reasonable limits. 

It’s not as bad as it could be. 
I will eventually push the right 
button. 

He tried to huddle back into 
sleep but he was awake and knew 
it. He wore the trousers of how- 



ever many years ago, or ahead, 
and he reached into the left front 
pocket. The jeweler’s screwdriver 
and the hex wand in the leather 
pouch were still there. He felt in 
other pockets and found that the 
notebook was secure, as was the 
device— that small object about the 
size of a pack of cigarettes which 
had once been as innocuous and 
familiar as his toothbrush standing 
in the glass where he washed his 
face before he went to bed, but 
which now seemed as alien as, say, 
a pear in a partridge tree. 

Sand the hell all over, dunes, 
and no oasis in sight. 

There was enough light now 
and Amos Appleby brushed aside 
the remnants of sleep and faced 
up to doing what he had to do. 

T ake the a train, yes. There’s 
been some music about that. 
Incomparable Duke. Take the A 
train from One Twenty-Fifth to 
Eighth Street, or the MTA from 
Park Street Under to Harvard 
Square, and see what’s there when 
you take the UP escalator. Go 
down the steps at Piccadilly Cir- 
cus, and come up at Green Park, 
expecting April sunshine but find- 
ing bleak December rain. Enter 
any door, Amos thought, at your 
peril. 

The beginning had been quite 
simple. And it hadn’t been on the 
A train or the MTA but on the 
Paris-Barcelona. Express B train? 



TAKE THE STRAIN 



85 



I (AMOS) pushed the button about 
half an hour out of Austerlitz. 

I was feeling fine, I wanted a 
drink and I’d given the porter 
enough time to get himself squared 
away. My wife, Helen, and I were 
headed eventually for Madrid, 
where she would visit an old friend 
and I would buy a guitar (a 
Ramirez . In the meantime we 
would spend a few days in Bar- 
celona, where I had laid on a few 
appointments with fellow physicists 
and where we had a date with 
Luis and Sonia Fonseca and garlic 
soup and cochinillo. 

I was feeling fine because my 
laboratory and classes were thou- 
sands of miles behind. I’d miss 
them soon enougn. But for now 
nostalgia was no problem. I was 
feeling fine because I was clicking 
through the night south of Paris 
in a mellow wagon-lit, one of the 
remaining means of travel worth 
mentioning. 

The porter tapped on the door. 
Neither Helen nor I thought much 
of drinking whiskey or gin in 
France. I ordered a bottle of Hen- 
nessey and Perrier. The porter was 
back in a minute and I made the 
drinks. 

We sat on the lower bed, I 
next to the window. This was 
understood, T had the greater in- 
terest. I sat by the window in 
planes too. I like to see what’s 
going on outside. We were well 



into the gentle farnv country of 
Loiret, nothing to see but tht 
trucks going toward and away 
from Paris on the grande route, 
which here paralleled the railroad. 
The clusters of red, white and am- 
ber lights were soothing— ambula- 
tory Christmas trees going here 
and there in the wrong season. 

I moved my head from the 
window, looked at Helen. 

“This,” I said, “is great. Why 
don’t we have trains like this in 
the States any more? You’re en- 
joying the trip?” 

There was a nagging, a pulling 
at me somewhere, making me won- 
der if I was doing all I was sup- 
posed to. I touched her knee ten- 
tatively. 

She was already into a paper- 
back but she raised her head, that 
head I knew so well, and we sat 
there — somewhere near Orleans, 
must have been — looking at each 
other. She was pleasant enough, 
sort of there, not making any fuss. 

“Did you bring aspirin or 
Empirin or something?” she asked. 

I reached for my flight bag, 
rummaged about, taking things 
out, putting them back. Not the 
neatest packer in the world am I. 
But I get along. I found the as- 
pirin, gave her two. 

, Helen had been watching me. 

“For Christ’s sake,” she said. 

“What?” 

She reached into my bag and 
pulled out something. 



86 



GALAXY 



“I will be damned,” she said, 
“if that isn’t the most stupid thing 
in God’s world to be carrying 
around Europe. Amos. Just what 
the hell is the big idea?” 

Helen talked like that now and 
then. I filled my glass. 

“When I closed the garage 
door on the way to the airport I 
was so — excited at the idea of 
meeting you in Paris I put the 
thing in my pocket instead of leav- 
ing it in the car. It’s all right.” 
I felt in the wrong, errant 
fourth-grader standing once more 
on cork tile before the principal’s 
tacky desk. Helen did that to me 
sometimes. My fault as much as 
hers — for letting it happen, that 
is — but still she did it. 

What I was inadvertently carry- 
ing around Europe was the trans- 
mitter that opens the door of my 
side of the garage in Cambridge. 
Big deal. I put it back in the bag, 
made Helen another drink which 
she acknowledged — though she 
was again into the paperback — 
with an air of suffering fools pa- 
tiently but without pleasure. I 
drank the Hennessey and Perrier 
and watched the lights on the road 
and in the occasional small station 
we disdainfully rattled through, not 
stopping. 

So what if I’d brought along 
the garage-door opener? I’m a 
professor, after all, and the quality 
of absence of mind is not unknown 
to my kind — nor to me, specif- 



ically and individually, though I 
am younger than most of my con- 
freres. Big deal. I pulled the gad- 
get again from the bag, looked at 
my wife, as if daring her to say 
something. 

She doesn 't know me. She 
doesn ’t know me at all ... 

For the hell of it I pushed 
the switch panel, having a wild 
thought of my garage door duti- 
fully rising on Foster Street in 
Cambridge. Home is the hunter, 
the door says, but it has been 
tricked by flea-power milliwatts 
bouncing too many times between 
E layer and Earth. If the door 
opens, my Belvedere— my eight- 
track stereoed companion and 
friend — will not be waiting on the 
ramp. It waits unprotected but not 
alone in the jungle of Logan air- 
port. 

This I was thinking. What hap- 
pened was something else. Helen’s 
figure blurred, then sharpened. 
And she had changed her dress. 

That was the first thing I no- 
ticed. She had been wearing a 
rather severe suit I won’t attempt 
to describe. Now she wore a tweed, 
skirt and yellow cashmere sweater. 
Her Hennessey and Perrier, I saw 
next, had changed to Pernod. Her 
hair was the same lustrous brown 
I had always liked — but it was 
done altogether differently. 

And this Helen was not reading. 
She was sitting there dozing and 
I knew she was ready for bed. 



TAKE THE STRAIN 



87 



I did not believe what I saw, 
of course, but I began to have 
some notion of what I was deal- 
ing with. I replaced — with great 
care, gently — the instrument in the 
flight bag. 

“Helen?” I said. 

M y wife, wearing clothes I 
had never seen before, open- 
ed sleepy eyes and looked into 
mine. And I looked into hers for 
whatever I could find. Nothing 
new right off— business as usual. 
“I’ve been asleep?” she asked. 
“For a few minutes. Ready for 
bed?” 

What, I wondered, did I think 
I was asking here— and of whom? 
I was still I. There was no dis- 
continuity in my history that I 
knew anything about. But Helen, 
somewhere, some time, had taken 
a different track. What if I asked 
her about the gray suit she had 
been wearing five minutes ago? 

“Did you bring the gray suit 
this time?” I asked. 

“I told you I wouldn’t bring 
any suits this time, Amos. And 
I don’t have a gray one. You 
can be so damn silly. What do 
you know about women’s clothes 
anyway?” 

I sat by the window. Not 
much, I said to myself, as Helen 
slipped out of her garments. That 
lovely body was the same, damn 
if it wasn’t, but there was some- 
thing different about non-body 



Helen, my wife. I saw it, felt it, 
somehow .tuned in on it, though I 
could not put my finger on it. I 
wondered whether to probe the 
past or the present. 

A flimsy black nightgown I 
had never seen dropped first over 
her shoulders and then over the 
rest of her. She dug into her toilet 
things, preparing for ritual. We 
slowed for a rustic station. I pulled 
down the shade and got ready for 
bed myself. As it worked out, I 
was ready before she was and 
crawled into the lower berth, won- 
dering. The trails were clicking 
smoothly beneath this bed, and 
there came toward me a woman I 
did not know but whose breasts 
and stomach and bottom and all I 
could describe with inflammatory 
detail 

“You expect me to climb up- 
stairs?” she asked, not altogether 
unkindly. 

“We could both be here for 
a while.” 

“You know I don’t like to 
make love in trains,” she said. 
“And anyway, I’m still sore from 
the last time.” 

She was on a different track, 
all right. 

There we were, this strange and 
desirable woman and, in what I 
thought was one of the few re- 
maining romantic situations — and 
she wanted me the hell out of her 
berth and aloft into mine. 

So aloft I went, there to brood.

GALAXY 



My wife, Helen, I had (with my 
door-opener and inadvertently) 
thrust somewhere into time and 
space. And here I was with, say, 
Helen A, who would have nothing 
of me, not now, though our situa- 
tion was attractive and I had done 
nothing to offend. My flight bag 
was on the rack near my head 
and as we slipped through the 
night I thought to retrieve the 
transmitter, push once, and see 
what Helen B was like. 

Or would she go back to plain 
Helen again? Not that she was 
plain, you understand. 

I resisted the impulse as a 
scientist and, instead, cast myself 
adrift upon a sea of fantasy. Then 
the clickety-click of the wheels on 
the rails and the gentle swaying 
of the car took over and I slept 
all the way to Perpignan. 

II 

B arcelona, a town worth 
visiting, knowing. I spent most 
of the first day there with col- 
leagues, interested in what some of 
them were up to but distracted by 
thoughts of Helen. Helen A. We 
were to be taken out that evening 
for garlic soup and cochinillo, I 
had extracted that promise from 
the Fonsecas before leaving Cam- 
bridge. The last of my several 
confrontations with colleagues had 
been duller than could have been 
expected and, with untidy excuses. 



I got out of there at five. I was 
near enough our hotel, the Colon, 
to walk back. I strolled along the 
Ramblas, a little worried about the 
girl I was approaching. I stopped 
and bought for Helen a bunch of 
what I took for marigolds. 

I stopped again to buy gin 
and vermouth. I thought to ply 
my wife, whoever she was, with 
drink, if necessary, before getting 
ready for the evening. 

When I got back to the Colon 
oui'room was empty. No cause for 
alarm. If Helen A were anything 
like Original Helen she would be 
out shopping. I rang for ice, then 
ran a bath, made a magnificent 
martini and settled into the hot 
tub. 

There was a clicking and turn- 
ing of a key in the hall door. The 
bathroom door was open — I had 
deliberately left it so — but it did 
not face the room. I could hear 
what was going on. Helen A was 
back with enough packages to 
need a boy’s assistance to get them 
into the room. She thanked him 
in impeccable Spanish and I heard 
the door close. 

“Hi,” I called. 

She came in, looked at me in 
the tub. 

“How did it go?” she asked. 

“Fine. You?” 

“I bought a couple of things. 
Nice things. The people in the 
stores are so polite.”

“You want a martini? I bought 
gin and vermouth. For practically 
nothing, by the way.” 

“All right.” 

“Have a sip of mine. I’ll be 
out in a rninute and make more.” 
more.” 

“That tastes good for a 
change.” 

“Yes.” 

The sound track goes about 
tike that but it doesn’t communi- 
cate. Original Helen and I had had 
our troubles, God knows, but now 
I wanted her back, because what 
Helen A was communicating, 
though not via the sound track, 
was — indifference. Distance. De- 
fense against intimacy. There I 
was, with all due immodesty, 
spreadeagled in the tub and Helen 
A’s reaction was remote— a voice 
saying nothing, coming my way 
from a far space. Original Helen 
would have done something, said 
something, reacted this way or 
that, whether she had any notions 
for the immediate future or not. 

“I want to show you what I 
bought.” 

Well, she was female anyway. 

“All right. I’ll be out shortly.” 
I wanted to think a minute. “Will 
you make?” 

I handed her my empty glass. 

I was thinking about time. This 
Helen brought me a martini al- 
most as good as the one I’d made. 

“What year were we married?” 
I asked. “I always forget the 
year.” 

90 



“Amos.” 

She started to say more, to ask 
a question, whatever. Then she 
told me and went back to her 
packages. Her year was two years 
earlier than mine. So I knew Helen 
A had been on a different road 
from Original Helen’s for at least 
ten years, maybe more. And where 
was Original Helen now? Where, 
for that matter, was the I Helen A 
had married? Though the conse- 
quences of my pushing the switch 
in the train had been totally un- 
foreseeable, I suddenly felt guilty. 
I got out of the tub, threw on 
a robe and, making interested 
sounds, looked at things bought. 

“I need a bath, too,” Helen 
said. “Do we have to hurry?” 

I looked at my watch. 

“No. Time for another martini, 
maybe two.” 

I had not, I realized, aban- 
doned all hope. When she was 
undressed I came close and en- 
veloped her from behind. If there 
was any Original Helen in her at 
all she would have to respond to 
this. 

She did. 

“For God’s sake, Amos,” she 
said, withdrawing. 

With finality. 

She even closed the bathroom 
door. 

My demands are not great but 
I’ve never tolerated frustration 
graciously. I was excited and I was 
rejected. My guilt feelings were 



GALAXY 



conveniently receding as well and 
I pulled the gadget from my flight 
bag. Am I, I stopped to ask, a 
responsible scientist or am I not? 
The hell with it. I jabbed the panel 
as if it were a punching bag. 

“Amos?” 

“Yes?” 

“Why did you close the door? 
I need you.”' 

Gentle reproach in her voice. 
And love, lots of love. 

I’ll be damned, I said to my- 
self. 

“I’m coming,” I answered to 
Helen B. 

OHE was blond. She was lovely. 
^ There was a look in her eyes, 
a look Helen A could not have 
come up with in a hundred years. 

“I need you,” she said, “to 
wash my back.” 

“Your wish is my command,”* 
I said. Shook I was, reduced to 
cliche. 

Wash it I did, not stopping 
with the back either. Things were 
looking up. 

“Ummm,” this girlsaid. “How 
soon do we have to be ready?” 

“I’m ready now.” 

“I’d noticed.” 

“We have time.” 

My goodness. Rembrandt, or 
whoever it was, - was wrong and 
wrong by orders of magnitude, 
with that crack about knowing all 
women if you know one. A painter 
he was but when the woman boat 



sailed away he was standing behind 
on the shore. I had known all 
along that he had been wrong but 
a postgraduate refresher course 
does no harm. 

Lovely, }ovely. Lovely. 

Then the Fonsecas were due. 
Neither of us, this Helen or I, 
wanted to go out for the night, 
cochinillo notwithstanding. But we 
live in a world of obligation and 
we had to dress and I had to think 
of Original Helen. Where was she? 
I could dispense with Helen A — 
she did not seem my responsibility,, 
somehow. I knotted my tie, then 
zippered this Helen up the back. 
She could do more for a zipper 
than most girls could for a ward- 
robe. 

These girls were all Helens, 
you know. They had all started 
out as the same girl, had all been 
launched a bit back there from the 
same genetic pad. (Yes, Helen B’s 
natural hair color was the same as 
that of the other two.) Now I’d 
known three of them (in respect 
to Helen A, I don’t mean that in 
the biblical sense), and they were 
the same and so different. Weird. 
And all I had to do was push the 
button. Feeling like God’s younger 
brother, I carefully stowed the gad- 
get where it would not be disturbed 
when the girl came in to make up 
the bed. 

The Fonsecas were below, then, 
and while they were coming up 
to the room my mind’s eye scan- 



TAKE THE B TRAIN

ned a dazzling and mixed array of 
Helens C through Z, and on into 
AA and ZZ, continuing — and I 
knew I had to be with Helen B 
and the hell with all those others, 
whoever or whatever they were. 
And Original Helen was still there, 
too, poking around inside my 
head, crying to be let out. 

Being a scientist, I resolved the 
problem for the moment, gave my- 
self some borrowed time by prom- 
ising that as soon as I was back 
in Cambridge I would study the 
gadget — in great secrecy, of course 
— and play it by ear from there. 

I was not about to change any- 
thing right then. 

“Tell me, Luis,” I said, “with 
all due respect to dear Sonia, if 
you could change one thing about 
her, just one, and a small thing 
at that, what would you do? 
Which button would you push?” 

We talked about that, then 
about how silly I was to bring up 
such a question. 

“Luis,” I said later, “tell me 
something else. Do you think that 
Sonia knows you?” 

I looked from one to the other, 
then to my wife. She understood, 
somehow, exactly what was in my 
head. She knew me. 

“Yes,” said Luis, after some 
consideration and a searching 
glance at his wife. “Yes, she 
does.” 

Sonia’s smile showed that this 
was so. 

After that we went out for 

92 



dinner. In the elevator my wife 
touched my wrist all the way 
down. She did not hold it or any- 
thing, just touched it. Something 
generous in me wept for all the 
poor bastards out there who could 
never know that touch. And the 
ungenerous counterpart said. Keep 
away, friend, far away - she’s 
mine .... 

T he rest of Barcelona was «an 
idyll. So was the train to 
Madrid. So was Madrid. I found 
a Ramirez which had obviously 
been made for me alone. It had 
been patiently waiting for me in 
the varnish-scented atelier of a 
man of genius. It leaped instantly 
into my grasp and later I played 
passionately for my wife -‘and in 
a Villa-Lobos Prelude (the Third) 

I was sure I heard Segovia. With 
fhis instrument, I said, I can truly 
talk to God. As - being his young- 
er brother — why not? A time like 
that. 

H uman error is what you have 
to watch for. Maxims of 
Amos A. Appleby, quoted by per- 
mission. 

I wrapped the gadget in cotton 
wool and carried it aboard the 
Madrid-Boston aircraft as though 
it, the gadget, were the true Grail. 
We had a lovely flight most of 
the way, my wife sitting by the 
window, her touch on me from 
time to time. And mine on her. 
We ran into turbulence about 
GALAXY 



an hour out of Logan. The belt 
sign flashed on and the girls toured 
the aisle, checking. I was checking 
dear Helen B when we went into 
a sickening drop which lasted too 
long. I should, of course, have 
been tending to my flight bag. It, 
along with all of us, was in free 
fall during the drop but we were 
restrained and it was not. And 
whatever it was, the gadget was 
■sensitive. 

The fall ended drastically with 
at least a 2-G tug. My unattended 
bag hit the floor. I heard it. I un- 
buckled my belt and dove for it 
but too late. 

Human error. 

Yep. Helen A again. I won- 
dered if the girls would notice the 
different clothes. I certainly did. 
She was back to skirt and sweater. 

“You all right?” I asked, 
knowing dark hypocrisy within my 
soul. 

Yes, I’m all right. I hope we 
don’t do that again. Don’t you 
want to sit by the window now?” 

“It doesn’t matter.” 

Some voice told me to push 
the button and keep pushing until 
Helen B came back. But some- 
thing else, another voice, warned 
me. 

That way lies disaster .... 

I listened, although disaster 
was already mine. I was silent, 
thinking, the rest of the way into 
Logan. 

Except for a few seconds. 

“How do you like my Rami”- 

take the B TRAI N 



rez?” I asked. 

■ “It sounds all right,” she said. 
“You didn’t play it much.” 

Ill 

WHEN we came to the garage 

■» on Foster Street I stopped 
the car on the ramp, got out and 
opened the garage door with the 
key meant to be used when the 
transmitter failed. 

“Where’s the opener?” this 
wife asked. 

In my suitcase somewhere. 
This is simpler.” 

She sighed. 

“You carry that thing all 
around Europe — where you can’t 
do a damn thing with it — and 
when you get back home where 
you can use it, you don’t have it.” 

“Yes, dear,” I said. 

I think she missed the tone. 

I didn’t feel safely home, warm 
and snug, after perilous travels. 

I felt that perilous travels were 
about to begin. 

“You’re irritable,” I said un- 
necessarily. “I devoutly hope you 
will feel better tomorrow.” 

She was silent. 

I carried the bags into the 
house. I was very careful with the 
flight bag and with the Ramfrez. 
Before bed I secreted the gadget 
in my shop/ lab in the basement 
and released my Ramfrez from its 
case, put it on a stand in my 
study. My lovely Ramfrez, my 
lovely Helen. One I had, the other 

93 



I had not. The Ramirez wanted 
to be played, I could tell. A guitar 
with which you can talk to God 
is more than a little like a loving 
woman. I apologized for not be- 
ing able to do it then and touched 
it softly once — for my comfort. 

Tomorrow, I said to my Rami- 
rez, I said to my very deepest self. 
Tomorrow and tomorrow .... 

Uneasy sleep, I think, is often 
worse than none. And uneasy sleep 
was, a matter of course, my lot 
that night. 

The next day was Saturday. I 
had time to myself. No need to 
go to my office or lab. By seven, 
Saturday morning, I sat on a high 
stool at my familiar workbench, 
regarding the gadget. Side by side 
with it was the opener for the 
other garage door, Helen’s. 

I really was a scientist now. 
Have you noticed that when you 
go to a good doctor with, say, a 
swollen thumb, he looks at the 
good thumb first? That gives him 
a base. Thus I examined Helen’s 
transmitter first, not the bomb 
which was mine. 

Cheap plastic case, model and 
serial numbers on a silver label, 
which also bore a statement of 
certification about Part 15 of FCC 
rules. Same legend on both of 
them —different serial numbers. I 
saw how the device was meant to 
be opened. I opened Helen’s. 

Simple and straightforward. 




Two tunable inductances, a tiny 
variable air capacitor, a dozen 
miniature resistors, a miniantenna, 
three transistors and so on — ordi- 
nary components mounted on a 
printed circuit and powered by a 



22Vi volt battery. A pocket-size 
broadcasting station. No problem. 

With great care I then opened 
the device that had started this 
caper and then there were prob- 
lems galore. Someone had put a 



ringer into my Belvedere compan- 
ion— a basic datum which, at this 
point, came on as no surprise. 
Problems, yes. Who? How? When? 
Above all, why? And what was I 
going to do about answers?

What I saw when I opened 
the case was a small black cube, 
fixed irremovably to one side of 
the case, not occupying much 
space. A twisted pair of delicate 
wires led from the cube to the 
switch panel. A pair of minute 
brass screws protruded from one 
side of the cube. A single similar 
screw was on the opposite side. 
And through an oval aperture in 
the face between, I made out a 
tunable slug, obviously meant to 
be adjusted with a tiny hex wand. 

And that was all. No battery. 
No visible power source. 

In my necessarily gentle tests 
the cube appeared impermeable, 
impregnable. I could find no way 
to take it apart or open it up. I 
set my multimeter to medium 
range, thinking to measure the 
potential across the two poles of 
the open switch. My meter blew, 
emitting a gentle puff of smoke. 

I had even more respect for the 
cube after that. 

I N THE end there was nothing 
there for me to understand or 
not understand - nothing for me 
to do except push or not push the 
switch. With or without accom- 
panying adjustments of one or 
more or all of the four adjustable 
elements. 

I replaced the cover carefully 
and resecreted the device in a safe 
place. Safe? Hearing the word 
rattling round inside my head I 



wondered who I kidded. Where 
did I think safety lay? 

I needed to talk. I went up 
to my study and approached my 
Ramfrez. She was receptive. We 
did not know each other well as 
yet but we would. Many are the 
faces of intimacy. Bach was talk- 
ing to both of us when the door 
to my study opened. Helen A, 
in dudgeon. 

“I was sleeping,” she said. 

The door closed behind her, 
and the walls of my study rattled. 

I’m not much good at flamenco 
but I played as wildly as I could 
for a few minutes. I’m not always 
proud of everything I do. At last 
I gently replaced the Ramirez and 
got down to business. 

I could, I thought, leave things 
as they were. But to do nothing 
would leave me troubled about 
what I had done to Original Helen, 
forgetting for the moment — im- 
possible — about Helen B. 

Original Helen and I had never 
really gotten together. My days 
with Helen B had brought my 
awareness of what I had missed 
to razor sharpness. But Original 
Helen had never been mean or 
malicious — we had made do with 
what we had and, in a fashion, 
we had gotten along. I had cast 
her adrift, God knew where, 
through no fault of mine. But 
what I did — or did not — from 
here on I couldn’t sweep that un- 
der the rug. 



96 



GALAXY 



Impossible to leave matters as 
they were. 

I could push the button a num- 
ber of times and see what hap- 
pened. I had known only three 
Helens so far. Maybe three were 
all that existed. If I got Original 
Helen back I could fold the opera- 
tion right there. I would not feel 
guilty about consigning Helen A 
permanently to a different track 
in her own uptight limbo. But 
then I thought of Barcelona and 
Madrid — and of lovely Helen B, 
who knew me. And it did not 
seem fair to Original Helen to 
bring her back and stop there. 
Not much of my heart would be 
in whatever came after. 

And there was the question of 
the available adjustments in the 
transmitter — what about them? 

Does my problem begin to 
emerge? 

Relatively minor puzzle: who 
put the ringer in my car and why? 
Why my car and what was the 
name of the game? Intelligence 
test? Tired old game being played 
by superior folks who were using 
me like a black rook in a galactic 
chess game? I did not know. I 
touched my Ramirez once more 
and went out to mow lawn, won- 
dering if Helen A was still trying 
to go back to sleep. 

F or a week I did nothing and 
that was as long as I could 
stand it. 



We were lying in bed, reading. 
I had made up my mind earlier 
in the day and the transmitter 
was hidden under a pile of papers 
on my bedside table. Being a 
scientist, I had a plan. I meant 
to push the switch ten times exact- 
ly, with only enough time between 
clicks to see what happened — a 
provision designed to prevent dal- 
liance. If either Original Helen or 
Helen B came back I would stop 
the experiment at that point and 
think about things a while. For 
in the back of my head was a 
thought that — if there were not 
too many Helens out there — I 
might discover a rotation by whose 
employment I might happily avoid 
Helen A, yet still discharge my 
responsibilities to Original Helen, 
Helen B and myself. 

“Good night— and good luck,” 

I had the courtesy to say. 

My wife turned to see what 
was wrong with me now and I 
pushed the switch. 

Eight women Joined me in bed. 
Original Helen did not appear. 
Neither did Helen A, which was 
pleasing, nor Helen B, which was 
not. Some Helens dyed their hair, 
some did not. In the first eight 
were two blonds and a redhead. 
The redhead was- number eight and 
I was taken aback for the moment, 
almost departing from scientific 
plan. 

My heart ‘belonged to Helen B 
but I said to this apparition. 



TAKETHE STRAIN

“Ready for, uh, bed yet, dear?” 

“Any time you are, tiger,” she 
said and began to move in. 

Wildly conscientious, possibly 
to the point of insanity, I pushed 
the switch the ninth time,; knowing 
infinite virtue, feeling like an idiot 
child. 

As it turned out I had second 
thoughts about letting the appari- 
tion go — because when I pushed 
the switch the ninth time I was 
suddenly alone in bed. No blond, 
no redhead, no nothing. Gone to 
the bathroom? 

“Helen,” I shouted, beginning 
to tremble. 

Nothing. 

Well, I thought, perhaps all 
was not lost, though such was the 
appearance at the moment. With 
enough Helens it was bound to 
happen. I’d gotten onto a Helen- 
track where she had died some- 
where back there — been killed, 
something. A hairy situation in 
any case. The room was quiet 
and 1 was alone. I could see my- 
self strangling in some Kafkaesque 
inquiry into the disappearance of 
my wife. 

Well, it’s like this, sir. I had 
this garage door opener, see, and . 

1 could see it, all right. Hear 
it, taste it. 

I pushed the switch again, 
bravely wondering who would 
show up. Nobody showed up. For- 
getting my plan, I flicked that 
switch again and again until I had 



demonstrated to my inquiring and 
now desperate mind that there' 
were not going to be any more 
Helens. 

Not unless something changed 
drastically. 

I thought of the three tiny 
brass screws and the tunable slug 
in the black cube. The experiment 
would have to proceecj on a dif- 
ferent track. I had to think, to 
talk, and I went up to my Ramf- 
rez, my steps echoing in what 
seemed to me now a strangely 
empty house. There’d been eight' 
lovelies in a row, by God, and 
now I had none. 

I was in deep trouble, possibly 
catastrophic. And I knew it. But 
part of me could not get the red- 
head out of my mind. I was cer- 
tain that I had missed something 
there. 

I clutched my Ramfrez and 
sought answers to mysteries. 

P LAN B went into effect the 
next day. I did two things 
which should be noted. I bought 
a small bound notebook of the 
kind used by scientists (loose-leaf 
won’t do, for obvious reasons); 
and I asked my department head 
for — and got — a week’s leave of 
absence. After that I thought for 
about twenty-four hours between 
snatches of sleep and random bits 
of food. 

Late the next night I opened 



98 



GALAXY 



the transmitter and placed it and 
the notebook on the bench beside 
my jeweler’s screwdriver and elec- 
tronic technician’s tuning wand. 

Earlier — in the bedroom, which 
somehow seemed the proper site — 
I had pushed the switch a few 
more times. Nothing had hap- 
pened. Now, at my bench, the 
countdown stood at zero. 

I made an entry — the first — 
in the notebook of what I was 
about to do, made a micrometric 
clockwise adjustment of the iso- 
lated tiny screw, muttered some- 
thing to someone or something out 
there, clutched the noteboo'k and 
tools in my hand and closed the 
switch. 

Nothing. 

Duly recorded. 

I turned the same screw in the 
same direction through as few de- 
grees of arc as I could manage 
and went through the same rou- 
tine. I felt something— like a sub- 
liminally perceived earthquake. I 
was scared but the operative 
thought was — this bird is going 
to get off the ground. 

One more micrometric nudge 
of the screw, another closing of 
the switch, a singularly unpleas- 
ant vertiginous moment of nausea, 
and I sat in the abandoned ruin 
of the basement of what had been 
my house, my home. 

I had loved this place and now 
it was dead, long dead by the look 
of things. And I was afraid, yes. 



but I thought I knew what I was 
up to. Fear, excitement, anticipa- 
tion and nostalgic sentiment were 
running neck and neck as I sat 
in the crumbling ruins. 

I had thought about the pos- 
sibilities, potentialities and dangers 
before opening the case and fid- 
dling with the screw. I had wan- 
dered up and down many un- 
disciplined alleys, strolled along a 
formal boulevard or two and 
wound up on a quiet residential 
village street -by which I mean 
that I had achieved a formulation 
reduced to basic simplicity but 
leaving a number of open ques- 
tions. 

Being a scientist, I confronted 
the unknown across a field of 
hypotheses. 

One — the device is not ter- 
restrial. Where it comes from 
eludes my grasp and for the mo- 
ment I abandon interest in that. 
Two — I am a test case, a subject, 
a rat in a maze, a chimp in a 
cage, trying to reach a banana. 

I have no hypothesis about what 
hangs in the balance. Three - 
granting hypothesis two, the test 
is twofold — can I discover how 
to make the device do my bidding 
and, if so, what will I tell it to do? 

BEGINNING in the ruins of 
" my once house, then, I be- 
gan to bend that black cube to 
my will, to show it who would 
win. My inquiry was exhaustive 



TAKE THE STRAIN

and meticulous. I made discover- 
ies. The two tiny screws close 
together were space (Cartesian co- 
ordinates), the solitary screw was 
time and the tunable slug was 
people. Simple? No - they inter- 
acted and when you changed one 
you changed them all and had to 
find a new balance. 

I went back and forth a lot — 
and here and there a lot. The time 
went as far forward or backward 
as I cared to think. The space 
was limited to Earth, apparently, 
but that still left plenty of room 
to get lost in. Little turns on the 
tuning slug brought people into my 
life, people in whom I had no 
interest. I thrust them out with 
my hexagonal wand. I could not 
find a position that brought Helens 
back — any Helen — so I left the 
slug in a null position. 

With the three screws, then, I 
sought a target - and the target 
was the Paris-Barcelona Express 
about thirty minutes before this 
caper had begun. The trouble was 
that the screws were sensitive in 
the extreme and subject to a cer- 
tain amount of backlash. In addi- 
tion, my hands were not steady. 

Understandable? 

Hence my undesired appearance 
in the Sahara. 

I was tired as anything and 
fought off waking as long as I 
could. But as soon as I knew I 
was awake I wanted to get on 
with it. I opened my eyes. Sand 



the hell all over, dunes, and no 
oasis in sight. All right, I had 
missed by bigger margins before 
and I felt I was bracketing the 
target. Baby, I said, this is it. 
Once there, back on the Paris- 
Barcelona Express, I thought to 
retrace the path. There was enough 
light now. I checked the last nota- 
tions in the notebook, opened the 
plastic case once more and reached 
for the screwdriver. 

A mos APPLEBY made it. Not 
■without incident — but he 
madejt. 

Original Helen reached into his 
bag and pulled out something. 

“I will be damned,” she said. 
“If that isn’t the most stupid thing 
in God’s world to be carrying 
around Europe. Amos. Just what 
the hell is the big idea?” 

He had the big idea, all right. 
The question of the eventual dis- 
posal, quietus, of the gadget was 
one he hoped to be able eventually 
to solve. Put the big idea just now 
was that when he and Helen B 
ran into turbulence over the west- 
ern Atlantic, Amos Appleby - 
with foreknowledge (his wife sitting 
there by the window) - would be 
well and truly prepared. 

It was not easy, later, think- 
ing ahead, to go to sleep that 
night, but finally the clickety-click 
of the wheels on the rails took 
over and he slept all the way to 
Perpignan. •

S ometimes a fairly minor in- 
cident succeeds in being re- 
membered all through life. The 
one I have in mind deals with a 
cold day and a newspaper clipping. 

When I was in high school it 
so happened that I had to leave 
the house before the delivery man 
brought the morning paper. A 
classmate of mine who liv^ some 
distance away and presumably had 
another delivery man did get the 
morning paper in time to read it 
before he left for school. One day 
he brought a clipping along which 
had the headline: “Nitrogen notan 
Element?” and reported that an 
English scientist, Lord Rutherford 
of Nelson, had found that bom- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 

u 



bardment with small atoms had 
shown that nitrogen seemed to 
consist of oxygen and hydrogen. 

As soon as our science teacher 
entered the classroom we raced. up 
to the desk and showed him the 
clipping. Dr. Borchert, who Appar- 
ently also did not get his morning 
paper in time, read it, shook his 
head and said: “Professor Ruther- 
ford is one of the greatest living 
scientists, but I know that nitrogen 
is an element.” 

No further discussion ensued. 
I never forgot that episode. 

Many years later I learned what 
had actually happened. The “small 
atoms” of the newspaper story 
had been alpha particles, the nu- 

101 



clei of helium atoms. The bom- 
bardment of nitrogen atoms with 
these alpha particles had resulted 
in the first transmutation caused 
by man. Rutherford had succeeded 
in transmuting a few nitrogen atoms 
into oxygen atoms with leftover 
hydrogen atoms. But nitrogen was 
still an element. 

Since then atoms have been 
split into two roughly equal halves 
to release their energy, and atoms 
of elements that do not exist in 
nature have been made. And a lot 
of new facts have been learned 
during the last few years. 

For those who do not conscious- 
ly deal with atoms every day a 
short refresher course is in order. 

The chemical elements are num- 
bered from # 1, which is hydrogen, 
to # 104, named Kurtchatovium 
after the Russian atomic physicist 
Igor Vassilyevitch Kurtchatov, who 
died in 1960. The numbers are 
neither in the order of discovery, 
as a student of mine once 
guessed, nor are they just arbitrar- 
ily chosen for filing purposes. They 
are based on a property of the 
nucleus. 

The nucleus of an atom is 
formed of protons, which carry a 
so-called positive charge, and of 
neutrons which have the same mass 
as the protons but do not carry an 
electric charge. Element § 33 (arse- 
nic) has this number because there 
are 33 protons in its nucleus. But 
there are also 42 neutrons present 



so that arsenic has the number 33, 
but the mass 75. For a slightly 
more complicated case let us look 
at copper. Its number is 29 because 
of the 29 protons in its nucleus. 
But the number of neutrons is not 
always the same; 69 per cent of all 
copper atoms have 34 neutrons in 
their nucleus— hence their mass is 
63. The other 31 per cent have 36 
neutrons in their nucleus — their 
mass is 65. There is no chemical 
difference at all between these two 
types of copper atoms; they belong 
in the same place in the table of 
the elements, under number 29. 
Greek for “same place” is eisos 
topos, which is the reason why the 
two kinds of copper atoms are 
called the two stable isotopes of 
copper. 

Bombardment with subatomic 
particles can produce unstable (i.e., 
radioactive) isotopes of any ele- 
ment. But they usually do not 
survive long and do not interest 
us here. The heaviest elements that 
still have stable isotopes are # 82, 
lead, and # 83, bismuth. The bis- 
muth atom with 126 neutrons in its 
nucleus, or Bi-209 is the heaviest 
stable isotope. Everything heavier 
is unstable and slowly falls apart. 
It may shoot out an alpha particle 
which consists of two protons and 
two neutrons. The nucleus that 
has just lost an alpha particle ob- 
viously is now four units lighter 
and two number lower in the scale. 
This is called the “alpha decay.” 



102 



GALAXY 



The next thing that was dis- 
covered was that there is also a 
“beta decay” which involves a 
change in one of the neutrons in 
the nucleus. A neutron may shoot 
out an electron which carries one 
negative charge. The result is that 
the formerly chargeless neutron has 
turned into a positively charged pro- 
ton. There is no change in mass 
(the electron does not count) but 
the element is now one number 
higher since it has one more proton 
in its nucleus. 

One more possibility is that 
immediately after “beta deeay,” 
which raises the atomic number by 
one, an alpha particle is thrown 
out, shifting the number down by 
two. Sometimes two alpha particles 
are shot out, so that the total shift 
in atomic number amounts to three 
numbers. Keeping these various 
possibilities in mind, Polish-born 
Kasimir Fajans developed what 
became known as “Fajans’ rule” 
which said that a transformation in 
the nucleus results in a shift (usu- 
ally downward) of one or two, in 
some exceptional cases of three 
numbers. 

Since everybody believed firmly 
in Fajans’ rule, atomic fission, when 
it took place, was not recognized at 
first. Nobody thought that an atom 
could split in two, resulting in shifts 
of 46 or even 48 numbers, in vio- 
lation of Fajans’ rule. Fajans him- 
self, incidentally, insisted that his 
rule had not been violated and that 



it still held true. Fission, he said, 
was something else. 

T he statement that bismuth. 

with the mass 209, is the heav- 
iest stable isotope seems to imply 
that radioactive isotopes of element,' 
with a number smaller than 83 
should all be artificial. However, 
there are a few exceptions— there 
are two elements with lower num- 
bers that have no stable isotopes. 
One of these two violators is = .tj, 
technetium (Tc) which is located in 
the atomic table below the well- 
behaved and stable element = 25. 
manganese. Technetium has 20 dif- 
ferent isotopes, all of them unstable, 
though I find the statement in the 
isotope list that technetium of mass 
97 has a half-life of 2.6 million 
years — which is pretty stable when 
compared to the human lifespan. 

The other violator in the region 
below # 83 where one expects atom- 
ic stability is one of the rare-earth 
elements, # 61, named promethium. 
It has 13 unstable isotopes, the one 
with the longest half-life is pro- 
methium of mass 145. Its half-life 
is 18 years. 

Now we come to the atomic 
heavyweights with more than 83 
protons in their nuclei. Interest- 
ingly enough, their masses can be 
less than that of the stable Bi-209. 
The lightest isotope of the next 
element after bismuth, # 84, polo- 
nium, has a mass of only 196, 
with a half-life of 1.9 minutes.

NOTE: Nos. 89-103 form the ‘family” of the actinides. 



All the elements from # 84 to 
104 have one thing in common — 
they have no stable isotopes. They 
are not alike otherwise. Chemically 
speaking # 94, plutonium, differs 
considerably from # 88, radium. 
In sequence we have five radio- 
active elements, from # 84, polo- 
nium, to # 88, radium, that differ 
from each other chemically, just 
as the lower-numbered stable ele- 



ments differ from each other chem- 
ically. Then we have a “family,” 
from# 89, actinium, to # 103, law- 
rencium, which Glenn T. Seaborg 
called the “actinides” from the 
name of their first member. These 
fifteen elements are chemically 
much alike, in the same manner 
as the fifteen “lanthanides” or 
rare-earth elements are chemically 
much alike. Element # 104, Kurt- 



104 



, GALAXY 



chatovium, is right now the only 
known element beyond the ac- 
tinides. 

The question is, of course, 
whether there are more elements 
beyond Kurtchatovium, but an- 
other term must be explained first. 
All the elements with numbers 
larger than 92, uranium, are called 
“synthetic elements” 1) because 
they are not found in nature but 
had to be made in the laboratory 
by shooting comparatively light 
nuclei into heavy nuclei, hoping 
that a still heavier nucleus would be 
the result. The term “synthetic” 
ignores the question of whether the 
element is a member of the acti- 
nide family or not. It simply points 
out that these elements do not exist 
in nature. Some, or all, may have 
existed in nature in the past. 

A glance at the table shows 
that the half-lives beyond # 97, 
berkelium, shrink rapidly. For# 98 
the longest half-life known is still 
800 years,, for # 99 it is down to 
140 days. For # 100 it is about half 
of # 99, namely 71 days, for # 101 
it is only 61 days. The next one, 
# 102 is down to 3 minutes, # 103 
to 45 seconds and # 104 to 5 sec- 
onds. Does that mean that # 105, 
when it is made, will show a half- 
life of maybe half a second? 

Very likely — but not necessar- 
ily. 

But a few words must be said 
about # 104 before we can discuss 
the elements numbered beyond it. 



The Russians who claim to have 
made # 104 first and who have 
named it (the name is not yet 
internationally accepted) apparent- 
ly found isotope Ku-260 which had 
a half-life of one third of a second. 
The other three isotopes with mass- 
es of 257, 258 and 259 were made 
at the Lawrence Radiation Labora- 
tory at Berkeley. Of these^ the 
isotope with mass 258 has a half- 
life of one hundredth of a second. 
Th^ one of mass 257 decays into 
# 102, nobelium, by emitting an 
alpha particle; its half-life is be- 
tween 4 and 5 seconds. The one 
with mass 259 also turns into 
nobelium (another isotope of it) 
by alpha decay; its half-life is be- 
tween 3 and 4 seconds. 

In the investigation of the heavy 
synthetics an interesting and new 
phenomenon was observed: spon- 
taneous fission. The well-known 
fission of uranium-235 and of plu- 
tonium is brought about by neutron 
bombardment: the nucleus that ab- 
sorbs a neutron falls apart. For 
heavier dements the fission process 
occurs without a known cause — 
but nature has provided an inter- 
esting hint. Those isotopes where 
both the number of the protons 
and of the neutrons are even are 
most susceptible to spontaneous 
fission. The list we now have, no 
doubt incomplete, reads: 

^ Numbers 43, technetium; 61, pro- 
methium; 85, astatine and 87, franc- 
ium, are synthetic elements, too.

ACTINIDES AND HIGHER 



The numbers to the left ore the atomic numbers (number of protons in the nucleus] 
while the top row of figures gives the numbers of neutrons in the nucleus. Block 
dots in the squares indicate that the isotope has been identified; blackened squares 
give the isotope with the longest half-life of each element. 



Cm-250 96 protons, 154 neutrons 

Cf-254 98 protons, 156 neutrons 

Fm-256 100 protons, 156 neutrons 

Ku-258 104 protons, 154 neutrons 

Ku-260 104 protons, 156 neutrons 

If the list is meaningful, ele- 
ment # 106 with mass 262 should 
be especially short-lived because of 
spontaneous fission, because its 
nucleus must contain 106 protons 
and 156 neutrons. 

That any isotope of the elements 
from # 102 to § 108 will have a 



half-life of even one day is most 
unlikely (one does not say “im- 
possible” any more). But beyond 
# 108 an area of relative stability 
might be reached again, though 
these elements would still be radio- 
active. 

The second table shows how the 
bottom rows of the Periodic Table 
are now arranged. It shows how 
the actinides correspond to the 
lanthanides (rare earths) and how 
the elements # 104 to #118 are 
expected to correspond to the ele- 
ments # 72 to # 86 above them in 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



107 



the Periodic Table. Glenn T. Sea- 
borg expects that if experimenters 
ever progress beyond # 118, the next 
bottom row will begin with # 119 
and # 120, corresponding to Franc- 
ium and radium and that a series 
of “super actinides” will follow. 

As for the still undiscovered, or 
rather not yet made, elements in 
the current bottom row a few 
things can be said. Element# 118 
will be one more member of the 
family of the “noble gases.” West 
German researchers expect that 
eka-platinum might have a rea- 
sonably stable isotope of mass 269. 
But hopes run highest for # 114 
below lead. It should be quite 
stable which in this case means a 
half-life of a hundred years or so. 

The Russians are engaged in an 
interesting hunt for this element 
right now. In nature, elements that 
are neighbors in the Periodic Table 
often occur in association, which 
means that lead might contain 
traces of # 1 14. It would, of course, 
have decayed, but such decay leaves 
traces in suitable materials — glass is 
one of them. Therefore the Russians 
are looking for old leaded church 
windows, old lanterns where lead 
was used to hold glass in place. 
They are not examining the lead 
but the glass for traces of the 
decay of element # 1 14 that may 
have been present in the lead. So 
far the search has not been suc- 
cessful. 



But surprises are possible any 
day of the week, including Sundays. 

• 

Sometimes I feel that the public 
does not have too much trouble 
swallowing the Space Age but that 
it chokes on the vocabulary. Re- 
cently a radio announcer, in dis- 
cussing the flight of Apollo # 10, 
must have used the term “albedo” 
with regard to the moon and a 
listener wrote to me asking what it 
meant, adding that it sounded like 
an Arabic word. 

Now not every word beginning 
with “al” is Arabic; in this case 
the root word is straight Latin, 
namely which means “white” 
(hence albino). The term means 
the “whiteness” of an astronomical 
object that is without luminosity of 
its own. 

Albedo is defined as the ratio 
of the amount of light reflected to 
the observer to the amount of light 
received by the diffusely reflecting 
object. The word “diffuse” is nec- 
essary here because the term albedo 
does not apply to a mirror or 
mirrorlike surface. Such reflection 
would be “specular” reflection, 
from Latin speculum, which means 
mirror. 

Now that we have the definition 
behind us, let us get down to a 
few cases. The brightest of the

STELLA 



No man, saw farther than Ermish, 
found a girl lovelier than Stella, 
or gave a gift so priceless . 

DANNIE PLACHTA 



E rmish stood at the farthest 
tip of the Nether Cape in the 
Land of Many Names, his head 
raised into the ebony wind, remem- 
bering long remembrances of an 
amber-tinted star framed in softest 



velvet, which had once stood cast- 
ing gentle shadows onto polished 
emerald eyes and which had been 
the most beautiful thing he had 
ever known. 

It had been a full hundred turns 



109 




since he had seen the Last Star 
and • he waited patiently now in 
this late turn of the Second Sea- 
son, knowing that the ancient charts 
were never wrong. Lerna would 
not join him in the traditional 
Firstwatch and he pondered upon 
her strange behavior. Six times 
she had shared with him the first 
sighting of the Last Star as it 
had arced above the forever invis- 
ible horizon and each time he 
had turned to see the first light- 
ing of her eyes. 

“Not this time,” she had said 
and she had meant it. 

He remembered, too, so many, 
many turns ago — when he had 
seemed no taller than the shim- 
mering patches of wild flicker- 
lilies that had occasionally colored 
the inland hills — how he had seen 
yet another star rise above the 
cape. That star had never returned 
but he knew that it had been very 
bright and very, very blue. 

“How strange,” the watchers 
had said, for no one had ever 
seen it before and it had never 
been found on the charts. 

“Lema saw it, too,” Ermish 
whispered into the wind and won- 
dered what the blue shadows might 
have done to her eyes. 

Those eyes would now be lidded 
by the weight of heavy purple 
lashes, he was just thinking, when 
his comset tinkled against thewhir- 
ring of the wind. 

“Ermish speaks,” he said, pull- 



ing the jeweled box from his belt 
and raising it near his face. 

The tiny comset hummed, 
crackled and said, “Has it come?” 
“Oh? The Last Star?” 

“No,” said the box, laughing 
quietly. “Your Blue Star.” 

His eyes squinted, swept a black 
area that might have held a hori- 
zon. He relaxed. 

“The world remains dark.” 
“Then may your Blue Star cast 
early shadows.” 

“Lema, why aren’t you sleep- 
ing?” 

“I tried,” she said. “There 
was a news report earlier. Some- 
thing about technical difTiculties 
at the Surface Sourceplant.” 

He laughed. 

“They’ve been having technical 
difficulties there since the First 
Turn.” 

“Yes, but if anything ever did 
go wrong with anything up there 
...” A pause within his hand 
hummed quietly. “Perhaps you 
should come back down.” 

“Such a serious Lerna,” he 
said, smiling. Then, solemnly: “It’s 
here.” 

A point of amber stabbed the 
wind. 

“Come down!” 

“Lerna, I do wish you were 
here.” 

“Now!” 

“Don’t be silly, Lema.” He 
was about to add: I’ll be down 
in a little while... until he sud-

denly realized that the comset was 
dead within his hand. 

Women are like the Five 
Winds ... 

He sighed, slipping the box 
into his belt. 

Without removing his gaze from 
the Last Star he sat down upon 
the shallow sand of the cape. The 
star was as exquisite as the hun- 
dred-turn memory he had held 
but he was vaguely saddened by 
ghostly thoughts of polished emer- 
alds. 

His head tilted back slowly 
as the lonely star climbed. 

A CRUNCHING of sand came 
at his side and Ermish turned 
his head in the dark. 

“You did well to find me with- 
out a torch.” He felt the sand 
shift slightly and reached out a 
hand. “Yes, please sit by me — 
I wish to see your eyes, as sleepy 
as they might be.” 

A small hand clutched his but 
his narrowed eyes searched in vain 
for twin pinpoints of amber at 
his side. 

“You really must be sleepy,” 
he said, as the sand slipped again 
and their bodies touched. 

“Hello,” said a voice in Er- 
mish’s ear so softly that it was 
almost swept away by the wind. 
“I’m Stella.” 

“Oh,” said Ermish. 

He tried to free his hand but 
somehow could not. The wind 



was slow thunder within his ears. 

‘‘‘You don’t know me,” cau- 
tioned the voice, perhaps more 
softly than before. 

“I’m'afraid I don’t,” he said. 
“The wind increases,” he added. 

“I came from very far,” the 
voice whispered, “to see you.” 
“From beyond the inland 
hills?” 

“Far beyond.” 

“Perhaps from the Denizen 
Dens, to better view the First- 
watch?” 

“From far beyond the Denizen 
Dens — to see you.” 

The air was suddenly calm. 
“Well,” said Ermish, wonder- 
ing. “And from what source did 
you learn of me?” 

“I learned of you just tonight.” 
“What is ‘tonight’?” 

“It doesn’t matter. I learned 
of you just this late turn.” 

“Then — are you from the Land 
of Many Names?” 

“My land has but one name 
and its name is ‘Old’.” 

“I’m afraid I’ve never heard 
of it.” 

“You would like it, I know.” 
Her voice was more distinct and 
the wind was a tender whisper. 
“Sometimes it’s all amber, with 
emerald tiles to walk upon.” 

“Oh,” said Ermish. 

“You would like it,” she said 
again. 

“Now tell me about yourself.” 
“I am just lately a woman and

they say that I am fair and my 
hair is long and of velvet.” ’ 

She whispered a laugh or, per- 
haps, a giggle. 

Ermish smiled and found that 
her hand was held more tightly 
within his own. 

“And why did you journey 
this far to see me?” 

“To ask you for your source- 
box.” 

The wind stirred, shifted, grew 
stronger. 

“I cannot survive for long with- 
out it.” 

“Yes, I know.” 

“A small portion of a turn at 
best.” 

“I shall return it soon— if only 
I can.” 

“Ever since our Lord Sun died, ' 
so many turns ago.” 

“It isn’t just for me.” Her 
hand gripped his very tightly. “We 
just want to see it — if only we 
had known sooner.” 

Ermish tore his hand free from 
the girl’s. He reached into his 
belt. Suddenly there was light. 

He looked to his side. He saw 
nothing there but the sand of 
the cape, quiet in the wind. 

Reaching out, he felt the girl’s 
warm arm. Listening carefully he 
heard her short breathing, barely 
audible above the wind. 

“You shouldn’t have done 
' that,” she said. And: “I’m sorry.” 

Ermish felt for her hand, found 

I it. 



“I don’t understand.” 

“There isn’t time.” She was 
quietly pleading. “Please, Ermish, 
your sourcebox.” 

With his free hand he reached 
back and slowly unscrewed the 
sourcebox at the nape of his neck 
and he felt the wind chill his 
spine. Swiftly but carefully he 
pushed the box toward the invis- 
ible girl. The wind stirred at his 
side and the crystal cone disap- 
peared. 

“Thank you. I hope that there 
is time.” 

_ “May this sourcebox wear well 
with you.” 

He shut off the torch, returned 
it to his belt. 

The girl, took her hand out 
of his. 

“I’ll try to return soon.” 

Her lips touched his cheek, 
softly and yet firmly. With a 
rustle of the wind he knew that 
she was gone. 

He looked up and saw the 
Blue Star. He blinked and it was 
gone. 

Ermish was staring at the Last 
Star when his comset sounded. 

“Ermish speaks.” 

“Are you all right?” 

Lerna, I gave my sourcebox 
away. To a lovely young girl. I’m 
sorry.” 

“The Blue Star.” 

“Yes.” 

*T felt — a feeling,” said the 
night within his hand. 



112 



GALAXY 



“She was — beautiful.” 

“I know.” 

“She may return in time,” he 
murmured into the wind. 

“I’ll give you mine.” 

“No.” 

“Then may your Blue Star cast 
early shadows.” 

“May your sourcebox wear well 
with you.” He held the comset 
more tightly, more closely, near 
his face. “And now I think that 
I shall — wait here.” 

There was a long moment of 
whispered crackling, almost the 
sound of shattered spray in the 
wind, or that of the flicker-lilies 
when they had twinkled upon the 
inland hills, until he realized that 
only the whirring of. the wind 
remained. 

He breathed the air as if par- 
taking of the ancient ceremonial 
Breathing of Smoke and, craning 
his neck, looked upward. 

The Last Star was nearly at the 
zenith when it suddenly flared, 
flickered, faded and was gone. 

Ermish stood at the furthest 
tip of the Nether Cape in the 
Land of Many Names, his head 
bowed into the ebony wind, remem- 
bering long remembrances of a 
velvet-haired girl, framed in softest 
amber, who had once stood cast- 
ing gentle shadows onto polished 
emerald tiles, and who had been 
the most beautiful girl he had 
ever known. •

Venus is not the planet with the 
highest albedo. It is, surprisingly, 
Uranus with 0.93. The next highest 
albedo is that of Neptune with 
0.84. Venus runs third with 0.76. 
Then comes Saturn with 0.69 and 
Jupiter with 0.67. 

The albedo of the earth is 0.40 
and that of Mars 0.16. Our moon, 
no matter how bright it may look 
in the night sky, has an albedo of 
0.07 — it reflects only 7 percent of 
the light it receives from the sun. 

But while the low albedo of our 
moon may be surprising to many, 
this does not mean that all moons 
have a low albedo. The albedo of 
the larger moons of the outer

The Island Under the Earth, 

Avram Davidson 

Out of the Mouth of the Dragon, 
Mark S. Geston 



F or one reason or another, 
lately. I’ve been thinking about 
what I’m doing. This is something 
of a step for me, since I did go a 
consid erabl e ti me without ev er stop- 
ping to wonder systematically about 
what makes a book — and then what 
it is that a person such as myself 
does in relation to it. Time having 
come around to this particular 
graduation, however, I thought I 
would share some of my attendant 
thoughts. , 



114 



GALAXY 



Well, first of all I naturally 
mean “novel” when I say “book.” 
If I mean anything else, I habit- 
ually follow the custom of mod- 
ifying in particular, as in “This is 
a non-fiction book,” or “This is 
a book of short stories.” If some- 
one hands me a plain brown 
wrapper containing what he calls 
a book, I expect a novel. 

I think this is because most of 
us are educated to think of a 
book as something more ^lan cas- 
ual; a physical format denoting 
special merit acquired through 
notable rffort, if you will. And in 
science fiction, or in any other 
class of imaginative literature, we 
tend to ^uate notability and serial 
complexity. (John Collier’s short 
stories are “clever.” Stephen Vin- 
cent Benet’s breathtaking star is 
already sinking below the popular 
literary horizon. Henry James, 
however, is reputed a noteworthy 
literary figure. Yet among these 
three men whom I’d consider well 
matched in most qualities of mind, 
learning, and skill, James remains 
considerable as the —usually un- 
read-creator of The Turn of the 
Screw, while Collier remains 
“clever” ibid, and Benet remains 
largely in the hearts of even some 
few of those who’ve read James 
Shore’s Daughter.) What I mean 
to say is that I can’t escape the 
syndrome either. If it’s short and 
complicated it’s one thing, and if 
it’s long and complicated it de- 



serves a thousand words of as- 
siduous inchworming, at my hands 
or at least at somebody’s. Yet 
there is more in “Jacob and The 
Indians” than there is in all we 
know of James Fenimore Cooper 
(not that I hope to shock you), 
and “The Devil George and Rosie” 
vaporizes most of Nathaniel Haw- 
thorne, to name another barreled 
fish. 

Furthermore, you and I have 
but to look at the sf reading list 
over any length of time to discover 
that a great many books are being 
published as novels which are in 
fact excuses'for broadsiding a cover 
with a price engraved on it. You 
know this, I know this. And yet 
with each new novel yet another 
fifty or sixty thousand words come 
into this world -with a little freight 
of stolen prestige and pre-empted 
bona fides. 

Why is this, you ask. And what 
does it all mean to us here? 

Well, this is because ifke all 
people we confuse the expression 
with the inspiration. We look at 
the novel and we can see the long 
series of encodings; the blips, ar- 
ranged in order of precedence, with 
which the laboring creator spells 
out his version of what flashed into 
his mind when the lightning struck 
him. Think, you say to yourself, 
of the potential for error; for getting 
some of the signals wrong, or for 
getting their precedence out of 
whack. Consider the chances of 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



115 



losing focus on the thread of sense 
being unreeled through the laby- 
rinth of options. What a task! 
/V»d what a triumph when ac- 
complished! 

And yet — think, now. When the 
lightning strikes the short-story 
writer, does it take less time than 
a split second? And when the 
novelist holds the mirror up to 
his flash, is his task really qual- 
itatively different from that faced 
by the fabulist? 

'' The thing that happens to any 
creator, it seems to me, happens 
in an instant. The rest is trans- 
lation. This fact makes a well-told, 
meaningful novel a thing of great 
merit, for the creator is then a 
master craftsman as well as an 
artist. A well-told tale of nothing 
special is something else again and 
a fumblingly told tale of something 
wonderful tends to cast grave doubt 
on the quality of the wonder. 

What does all this mean to us 
here, ibid? 

Well, I haven’t formed an opin- 
ion worthy of graving in tablets 
of stone, but we all know, I think, 
the constant pressure in modern 
sf to produce books, meaning 
novels. We can see, I think, the 
books by creators who feel com- 
pelled to describe arbitrarily the 
lightning flash at length, and the 
books by craftsmen who, having 
no other present recourse, appear 
to be working with tired fireflies 
in a jelly jar. 



I would not tell you the novel 
is inconsiderable. The novel is the 
pinnacle of our heritage in litera- 
ture. I would not tell you that short- 
story writing ought to be better 
supported or that it isn’t well 
supported now. It should be and 
I guess it is. I would address the 
paradox on another level; thusly: 
A being qualified to live with 
lightnings ought to respect the sole 
source of its consciousness. 

A VRAM DAVIDSON’S The Is- 
land Under the Earth (Ace 
Special # 37425, 754;) is the first 
volume in a trilogy and one ought 
to reserve judgment. But it’s un- 
likely Ace will issue the three- 
volume set in any practical length 
of time and, besides, I enjoyed all 
but a very few things in this book, 
notably the ending. The ending 
is very poor — a blatant copout on 
a one-line gag which, one hopes, 
will some day be erased in some 
beneficial cataclysm. Surely it has 
nothing to do with what went oh 
in Avram’s mind when this creation 
first struck its crystal hooves upon 
the sharp flints of his talent. I 
guarantee your disappointment. 

However, (and I’ve found that 
I’ve said this too many times, about 
too many books, now, but here 
is the Everest of these Himalayas) 
the source of this real grudge 
against the book is the book’s 
captivating excellence. 

Its locale is that place below 



116 



GALAXY 



the Earth — or maybe perhaps be- 
low the world, the distinction being 
the same as the distinction between 
the brain and the mind — where the 
stars form constellations of webbed 
lines and the inhabitants are not 
quite sure of which life is master 
of Creation. Certainly there’s sharp 
rivalry between the six-limbed folk 
and a form of life which closely 
resembles human beings. But 
there’s a harpy who’d grumble 
quite convincingly that there’s more 
to it than centaurs. Or you could 
always go ask the homophage. 

This is a fine old adventure 
story. In common with all other 
men. Captain Stag is aware that 
things are a little beyond him. 
Captain Stag being an uncommon- 
ly able man, however, it angers 
him that, no matter what, things 
are always a little bit beyond him 
and yet he lacks the excuse of 
ineptitude. So he seeks the answer 
to what makes things the way they 
are. In seeking it he runs counter 
to or across the purposes of simi- 
larly motivated folk of various 
persuasions and shoe sizes. And of 
course some of his moves win him 
extra turns, while others impose 
penalties. And so we follow him 
in his search for the legendary 
Cap of Grace and attempt to 
guess ahead of him, and of kindly 
Uncle Av, what will befall him 
and us next. 

The difference between one of 
these stories and the next is always 



in the soul of the creator. The 
storyline is as simple as it is 
Grimm, and especially lately there 
is no shortage of publishers for it. 
Too, it’s almost uniquely true that 
the degree of the reader’s eventual 
enjoyment is in direct and swift 
relationship to the author’s degree 
of loving involvement as he spins 
out the yarn. Since the landscape 
has no counterpart in reality, and 
the odd bits of stock legend and 
standard education cannot be bor- 
rowed too blatantly or too con- 
tinuously, what else has the writer 
to draw on but the vista of his 
dreams? I say it thus takes a 
rich, wise man to write one of 
these things properly, and then one 
generous enough to share his 
wealth. 

Gee, what a crummy ending! 
Bad ending, Avram. Say, T*erry, 
that’s a disappointing ending on 
The Island Under the Earth. 

It’s a good book. Good. Good 
novel. Waiting for the rest of it. 
Yes. Wish you had brought it out 
all in one. Suspect it would be 
superb. 



KAY. From one legendary for- 
^ mat to another. Hey, presto. 

It will certainly happen. In the 
end we will grow so weary of it 
that we’ll believe we’re damned 
unless we stage the conclusive 
Armageddon. And so, to save our 
souls, we will flog ourselves to

weary death, leaving the survivors 
to curse their ineptitude. 

This world and mood are 
brought to —I was going to say 
‘life,’ was I? — by Mark S. Geston, 
who used to be the author of Lords 
of the Starship and is now the 
author of Out of the Mouth of 
the Dragon. (Ace # 64460. 60<t) 

The easy way to explain Ges- 
ton’s evolution between these two 
books is to recall that he’s young. 
That makes it easy. Whereas Star- 
ship was episodic, fantastic in pre- 
cisely the same way as a C.L. 
Moore story from the Northwest 
Smith days, and compulsive, this 
book concentrates quite well on 
one individual and his viewpoint, 
but is still a little choppy. As far 
as I can determine there is no 
fantasy in it— there is, instead, some 
nightmarish technology— and more 
than a passing evocation of the 
younger Philip K. Dick. Somehow, 
this calls to mind the effect on 
C.L. Moore’s stories of her mar- 
riage to Henry Kuttner, and this, 
in turn, makes me realize one 
could write a pretty monograph 
on the debt Phil Dick owes to 
Kuttner. What I’m saying— again— 
is that Geston immediately makes 
you start thinking in terms of very 
good company. 

But now back to our message. 

Compulsive. In Starship, you 
will recall, the generations-long ef- 
fort to rebuild the relic of the 
past is frustrated in a climactic 



wassail of destruction which the 
book explicitly ascribes to the in- 
fluence of the Forces of Evil. 

Now, this is fine in terms of 
a young writer seeing a vision and 
wanting an excuse for it. But what 
is made plain in Dragon is that 
you don’t need any such simplistic 
explanation; the necessary impulses 
are to be found quite near the 
bone in even the holiest of men. 
One can only assume Geston has 
been growing up. He explicitly in- 
corporates the Starship episode in 
the history he relates here, but he 
also explicitly denies the malign 
phantasms of the earlier book. He 
does this latter thing in two ways, 
one stunning and the other accept- 
able; 

First of all, Amon VanRoark, 
the viewpoint character, encounters 
repeated examples of prosthetic 
technology so fine that the dead 
don’t clearly die; for instance, one 
of his principal mentors in his 
wanderings around the war-blasted, 
hag-ridden, self-devouring world of 
interminable erosion is a man who 
begins to make even more sense 
after his brain rots and his arti- 
ficial larynx is free to speak at 
random. Apart from being a piece 
of invention that anyone might 
envy, this is pretty obviously in- 
tended to be an author’s signal 
to the discerning reader that qll 
the ghost stuff in Starship is here- 
by superseded. I can make this 
brilliant and arbitrary literary

judgment because Geston also 
fills his book with other signals 
that tell us he believes in signaling 
the reader. 

I won’t weary you with a list of 
the symbols placed throughout this 
work. (Not having kept one. Lazy.) 
The brilliant beetle that expresses 
itself by eating its own bowels will 
do as well as any single instance 
would, I guess, although you might 
prefer the lizard that has gotten 
into priestly garments by the 
straightforward expedient of eat- 
ing its way into them. 

(So who told you this was a 
book for the little old lady in 
Bettendorf?) 

Anyway. This gray odyssey fol- 
lows Amon VanRoark from his 
youth in a particular decaying city 
through a series of episodes around 
the twitching, ghastly world of the 
future and finds him returning, a 
neither more nor less sad but not

THEMERRIER! 

In last month's GALAXY, it 
was stated that Dune Messiah 
would be concluded in this is- 
sue. That announcement was 
overly optimistic. When you 
start reading on the following 
page, you will eventually dis- 
cover that the current install- 
ment does not take you to the 
conclusion of the novel. Actu- 
ally, it will conclude in GAL- 
AXY'S November issue. 

This situation came about be- 



even wiser man to the abandoned 
ruins of his maturity. He is mad 
as a hatter, of course; the ques- 
tion is whether he was sane even 
when we first glimpsed him, and 
I suppose the larger question then 
is whether the world was ever 
sane, even as far back in his past 
as our lime. 

One might hope that Geston is 
not going to spiral up his own 
geist. One might point out that a 
good thing to try next time would 
be to write a story in which the 
\iewpoint character has at least 
a slight influence on the events 
around him, rather than simply 
turning out the lights after work. 
'But this book too is a novel, 
and Geston is a creator, and that, 
my friends, is item # large in my 
continuing list of proof that we’ve 
got a reriaissance going here. Fun- 
ny it should involve a book like 
this. Where have all the flowers 
gone? • 

cause a wealth of material 
reached your editor's desk all 
at once. Rather than deprive 
readers of any of it, the decision 
was made to finish The Dune 
Messiah in two installments 
rather than one — thus making 
space for the inclusion of de- 
serving stories that otherwise 
would have been crowded out. 

By the way, this marvelous 
Dune novel will shortly be ap- 
pearing as a hardcover book

DUNE 
MESSIAH 



WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

Dune was an arid planet, in- 
habited by gigantic sandworms and 
wild Bremen whose customs were 
based on water scarcity. Its only 
resource was melange, an addic- 
tive drug produced by the worms.- 
This “spice” aided longevity and 
gave an adept visions of the future. 

After the murder of his noble 
father, PAUL ATREIDES was 
dumped into the desert, together 
with his pregnant mother, the 
LADY JESSICA, who had been 
trained by the Bene Gesserit — a 



120 



female order devoted to mental 
arts and the control of genetic 
lines to produce a “kwisatz had- 
erach, ” a messiah capable of using 
psi powers. Paul was to be their 
key to this. 

In learning to live with the Fre- 
men, Paul wai forced to take an 
overdose of drug. This opened his 
mind permanently to the future — 
or futures. Lady Jessica also took 
an overdose with the result that 
ALIA, Paul’s sister, was born with 
full knowledge of all her mother 
had known. 

Paul, also' known as MUAD’ 
DIB, eventually led the Fremen 
against the Harkonnen rulers and 
their Sardaukar soldiers. In the 
battle, Paul’s old friend and teach- 
er, DUNCAN IDAHO, was killed. 
As ruler, Paul took the Harkon- 
nen heir, PRINCESS IRULAN, as 
his consort. But he refused to con- 
summate the marriage, remaining 
true to the Fremen woman 
CHANI. 

Now twelve years later, Paul 
has made the desert bloom and he 
rules a mighty empire of stars. 
He has become almost a god to 
the Qizarate, a cult built around 
his visions. Against it, the other 
quasi-political, quasi-religious forces 
of humanity have just begun to 
unite. 

Among these is the Bene Ges- 
serit, headed by the Reverend 
Mother GAIUS HELEN MO- 
HIAM, working through the weak 
help of their trainee. Princess Iru- 
lan. More or less with them is 
the Bene Tleilax, supposedly 
amoral scientists; their representa- 



tive is the Tleilaxu Face Dancer 
SCYTALE, who can look like any 
man or woman. The two groups 
have the aid of the Spacing Guild, 
which must control the melange 
trade, since only spice visions make 
interstellar navigation possible. 
Their Steersman EDRIC is more 
fishlike than human and must live 
in a tank. His main function is to 
obscure Paul’s visions with his own 
gift so their plotting will not be 
detected. 

They send Princess Irulan back 
to Paul to demand he give her an 
heir; she has so far kept Chani 
sterile by adding drugs to the Fre- 
men woman’s food. Paul refuses. 
He is filled with bitter visions, un- 
sure but that he is the very in- 
strument of the future he tries to 
avoid. He is sure, however, that a 
royal heir by Irulan will destroy 
all hope. 

Paul detects the Reverend 
Mother on Edric’s ship and has 
her arrested. But Scytale and 
BIJAZ, a created Tleilaxu dwarf, 
escape. 

Scytale secretly visits a Fremen 
quarter to gain information. He 
leaves Bijaz behind but takes with 
him the semuta-addicted daughter 
of OTHEYM, a bitter old desert 
fighter. Her name is LICHNA. 

During an interview with Edric, 
Paul learns nothing. The presence 
of the Steersman muddies all his 
future visions. It also upsets STIL- 
GAR, his minister of state, and 
KORBA, head of the Qizarate. 
Paul can only determine that the 
Reverend Mother has suggested 
that Princess Irulan have Chani 



ELEMENTOF CHANCE 



121 



killed, since Paul’s mate now re- 
fuses the food containing the steril- 
ity drug. 

Edric then makes Paul a shock- 
ing present - something that looks 
like Duncan Idaho, except for me- 
tallic eyes. It is a ghola - Duncan’s 
body has been regrown from its 
cell patterns by Tleilaxu science. 
But it has no memories from its 
former life and is now named 
HA YT. Paul is disturbed by the 
fact that he saw no vision of Dun- 
can’s return. He asks the purpose 
of the gift, and Hayt answers: “I 
have been sent to destroy you. ” 
But Hayt does not know how it will 
come about. He tells Paul to send 
him away — but Paul cannot, since 
Duncan was once so close to him. 

Alia is sent to study the body 
of a girl found in the desert. She 
can learn little, except that the 
corpse shows signs of semuta-ad- 
diction, but she is sure it indicates 
some grave danger. On the way 
back, Hayt reveals signs of being 
the real Duncan Idaho, and she 
is attracted to him in spite of 
herself. When he kisses her, she 
protests; but he tells her he only 
did what she wanted— and she 
realizes he is right. 

On the verge of new struggles 
of empire, Paul finds nothing go- 
ing well. There are reports of trea- 
son among the Fremen and an at- 
tempt to steal a worm and develop 
melange on another world — but 
which world Paul cannot see. He 
grows more worried as his visions 
grow more and more confusing. 
He constantly sees a moon falling- 
some highly personal symbol of 



disaster; the meaning eludes him. 

Paul sees the Reverend Mother 
Mohiam and tells her that Chani 
is now pregnant. For peace from 
her, he promises that Irulan may 
have a child by artifical insemina- 
tion— but not an heir to the throne. 
Upset, she agrees to wait while 
she consults her order. 

But it is no. victory. Paul admits 
to the ghola — who is becoming 
more and more Duncan Idaho — 
that he knows birth of an heir 
means Chani 's death; there are 
problems because of the years of 
secret contraceptive.. But he can 
do nothing. 

Otheym’s daughter Lichna — 
really Scytale in her form —appears 
with a message that Otheym asks 
Paul to come to him, since he has 
information on the traitor Fremen. 
Paul knows it is Scytale, but the 
future demands he act as if it 
were really Lichna. He is not en- 
couraged when he visits one of 
Alia’s religious ceremonies for the 
pilgrims; under an overdose of me- 
lange, she sees what he fears. 

At Otheym’s house, he meets 
Bijaz — and gets another shock, 
since there was no dwarf-ghola in 
his vision! Otheym speaks bitterly 
of treason, but says the dwarf 
knows the names of the disloyal. 
He gives Paul the dwarf as Paul 
leaves. Outside, Paul turns Bijaz 
over to Stilgar and begins directing 
the search for the traitors. 

Then a blast of radiation strikes 
the searching troops. It is a for- 
bidden “Stone Burner’’— an atomic 
bomb in which the type of radia- 
tion can be adjusted.

T he ground grew hot. Paul 
heard the sounds of running 
stop. Men threw themselves down 
all around him, every one of them 
aware that there was no point 
in running. The first damage had 
been done; and now they must 
wait out the extent of the stone 
burner’s potency. The thing’s radia- 
tion, which no man could outrun, 
already had penetrated their flesh. 
The peculiar result of stone burner 
radiation already was at work in 
them. What else this weapon might 
do now lay in the planning of 
the men who had used it in de- 
fiance of the Great Convention. 

“Gods. a rotten stone burn- 
er,’’ someone whimpered. “I don’t 
. want . to be . blind.” 

“Who does?” It was the harsh 
voice of a trooper. 



“The Tleilaxu will sell many 
eyes here,” someone near Paul 
growled. “Now, shut up and 
wait!” 

They waited. 

Paul remained silent, thinking 
what this weapon implied. Too 
much fuel in it and it would cut 
its way into the planet’s core. 
Dune’s molten level lay deep, but 
the more dangerous for that. Such 
pressures released and out of con- 
trol might split a planet, scatter- 
ing lifeless bits and pieces through 
space. 

“I think it’s dying down a bit,” 
someone said. 

“It’s just digging deeper,” Paul 
cautioned. “Stay put, all of you. 
Stilgar will be sending help.” 

“Stilgar got away?” 

“Stilgar got away.” 

“The ground’s hot,” someone 
complained. 

“They dared use atomics!” a 
trooper yelled furiously. 

“The sound’s diminishing,” 
someone down the street said. 

pAUL ignored the words and 
^ concentrated on his fingertips 
touching the street. He could feel 
the rolling-rumbling of the thing — 
deep . deep . 

“My eyes!” someone cried. “I 
can’t see!” 

Someone closer to it than I 
was, Paul thought. He still could 
see to the end of the cul-de-sac 
when he lifted his head, although 
there was a mistiness across the 
scene. A red-yellow glow filled 
the area where Otheym’s house 



DUNE MESSIAH 



123 



and its neighbor had been. Pieces 
of adjoining buildings made dark 
patterns as they crumbled into the 
glowing pit. 

Paul climbed to his feet. He 
felt the stone burner die, leaving 
silence beneath him. His body was 
wet with perspiration against the 
stillsuit’s slickness — too much for 
the suit to accommodate. The air 
in his lungs carried the heat and 
sulfur stench of the burner. 

As he looked at the troopers 
beginning to stand up around him, 
the mist on Paul’s eyes faded into 
darkness. He summoned up his 
oracular vision of these moments, 
then turned and strode along the 
track that Time had carved for 
him, fitting himself into the vision 
so tightly that it could not escape. 
He felt hirtiself grow aware of 
this place as a multitudinous pos- 
session, reality welded to pr^ic- 
tion. 

Moans and groans of his 
troopers arose all around him as 
the men realized their blindness. 

“Hold fast!” Paul shouted. 
“Help is coming!” And, as the 
complaints persisted, he said: 
“This is Maud’dib! I command 
you to hold fast! Help comes!” 

Silence. 

Then, true to his vision, a 
nearby guardman said: “Is it truly 
the Emperor? Which of you can 
see? Tell me.” 

“None of us has eyes,” Paul 
said. “They have taken my eyes 
as well, but not my vision. I can 
see you standing there, a dirty 
wall within touching distance on 
your left. Now, wait bravely. Stil- 



gar comes soon with our friends.” 
The thwock-thwok of many 
’thopters grew louder all around. 
There was the sound of hurrying 
feet. Paul watched his friends 
come, matching their sounds to 
his oracular vision. 

“Stilgar!” Paul shouted, wav- 
ing an arm. “Over here!” 

“Thanks to Shai-hulud,” Stil- 
gar . cried, running up to Paul. 
“You’re not...” In the sudden 
silence, Paul’s vision showed him 
Stilgar staring with an expression 
of agony at the ruined eyes of his 
friend and emperor. “Oh, m’ 
Lord,” Stilgar groaned. “Usui. 
Usui . Usui ...” 

“What of the stone burner?” 
one of the newcomers shouted. 

“It’s ended,” Paul said, rais- 
ing his voice. He gestured. “Get 
up there now and rescue the ones 
who were closest to it. Put up 
barriers. Lively now!” He turned 
back to Stilgar. 

“Do you see, m’Lord?” Stil- 
gar asked, wonder in his tone. 
“How can-you see?” 

For answer, Paul put a finger 
out to touch Stilgar’s cheek above 
the stillsuit mouthcap, felt tears. 
“You need give no moisture to 
me, old friend,” Paul said. “I 
am not dead.” 

“But your eyes!” 

“They’ve blinded my body, but 
not my vision,” Paul said. “Ah, 
Stil, I live in an apocalyptic dream. 
My steps fit into it so precisely 
that I fear most of all I will grow 
bored reliving the thing so 
exactly.” 

“Usui, I don’t, I don’t...” 



124 



GALAXY 



“Don’t try to understand it. 
Accept it. I am in the world 
beyond this world here. For me, 
they are the same. I need no hand 
to guide me. I see every move- 
ment all around me. I see every 
expression of your face. I have 
no eyes, yet I see.” 

S TILGAR shook his head sharp- 
ly. “Sire, we must conceal your 
affliction from ...” 

“We Hfde it from no man,” 
Paul said. 

“But the law...” 

“We live by the Atreides Law 
now, Stil. The Fremen Law that 
the blind should be abandoned 
in the desert applies only to the 
blind. I am not blind. I live in 
the cycle of being where the war 
of good and evil has its arena. 
We are at a turning point in the 
succession of ages and we have 
our parts to play.” 

In a sudden stillness. Paul 
heard one of the wounded being 
led past him. “It was terrible,” 
the man groaned, “a great fury 
of fire.” 

“None of these men shall be 
taken into the desert,” Paul said. 
“You hear me, Stil?” 

“I hear you, m’Lord.” 

“They are to be fitted with 
new eyes at my expense.” 

“It will be done, m’Lord.” 
Paul, hearing the awe grow in 
Stilgar’s voice, said: “I will be 
at the Command ’thopter. Take 
charge here.” 

“Yes, m’Lord.” 

Paul stepped around Stilgar, 
strode down the street. His vision 



told him every movement, every 
irregularity beneath his feet, every 
face he encountered. He gave or- 
ders as he moved, pointing to 
men of his personal entourage, 
calling out names, summoning to 
himself the ones who represented 
the intimate apparatus of govern- 
ment. He could feel the terror 
grow behind him, the fearful 
whispers. 

“His eyes!” 

“But he looked right at you, 
called you by name!” 

At the Command ’thopter, he 
deactivated his personal shield, 
reached into the machine and took 
the microphone from the hand of 
a startled communications officer. 
He issued a swift string of orders 
and thrust the microphone back 
into the officer’s hand. Turning, 
Paul summoned a weapons spe- 
cialist, one of the eager and bril- 
liant new breed who remembered 
sietch life only dimly. 

“They used a stone burner,” 
Paul said. 

After the briefest pause, the 
man said: “So I was told. Sire.” 

“You know what that means, 
of course.” 

“The fuel could only have been 
atomic.” 

Paul nodded, thinking of how 
this man’s mind must be racing. 
Atomics. The Great Convention 
prohibited such weapons. Dis- 
covery of the perpetrator would 
bring down tlie combined retribu- 
tive assault of the Great Houses. 
Old feuds would be forgotten, dis- 
carded in the face of this threat 
and the ancient fears it aroused.

“It cannot have been manufac- 
tured without leaving some 
traces,” Paul said. “You will as- 
semble the proper equipment and 
search out the place where the 
stone burner was made.” 

“At once. Sire.” With one last 
fearful glance, the man sped away. 

“M’Lord,” the communications 
officer ventured from behind him. 
“Your eyes ...” 

Paul turned, reached into the 
’thopter and retuned the com- 
mand set to his personal band. 
“Call Chani,” he ordered. “Tell 
her . tell her I am alive and will 
be with her soon.” 

Now the forces gather, Paul 
thought. And he noted how strong 
was the smell of fear in the per- 
spiration all around.

—The Moon Falls Down 
Songs of Muad’dib 

A fter seven days of radiating 
■ fevered activity, the Keep took 
on an unnatural quiet. On this 
morning, there were people about, 
but they spoke in whispers, heads 



close together, and they walked 
softly. Some scurried with an odd- 
ly furtive gait. The sight of a 
Guard detail coming in from the 
forecourt drew questioning looks. 
Frowns greeted the noise these 
newcomers raised with their tramp- 
ing about and stacking of weapons. 
The newcomers caught the mood of 
the interior, though, and began 
moving in furtively. 

Talk of the stone burner still 
floated around: “He said the fire 
had blue-green in it and a smell 
out of hell.” 

“Elpa is a fool! He says he’ll 
commit suicide rather than take 
Tleilaxu eyes.” 

“I donU like talk of eyes.” 

“Muad’dib passed me and he 
called me by name!” 

“How does He see without 
eyes?” 

“People are leaving, had you 
heard? There’s great fear. The 
Naibs say they’ll go to Sietch 
Makab for a Grand Council.” 

“What have they done with the 
Panygerist?” 

“I saw them take him into the 
chamber where the Naibs are meet- 
ing. Imagine Korba a prisoner!” 

Chani had arisen early, awak- 
ened by a stillness in the Keep. 
Turning, she had found Paul sit- 
ting up beside her, his eyeless 
sockets aimed at some formless 
place beyond the far wall of their 
bedchamber. What the stone burn- 
er had left with its peculiar af- 
finity for eye tissue, all that ruined 
flesh, had been removed. Injections 
and ungents had saved the stronger 
flesh around the sockets, but she 



126 



GALAXY 



felt that the radiation had gone 
deeper. 

Ravenous hunger seized her as 
she sat up. She fed on the food 
kept by the bedside— spicebread, 
a heavy cheese. 

Paul gestured at the food. “Be- 
loved, there was no way to spare 
you this. Believe me.” 

Chani stilled a fit of trembling 
when he aimed those empty sock- 
ets at her. She’d given up asking 
him to explain. He spoke so odd- 
ly. “I was baptized in sand and it 
cost me the knack of believing. 
Who trades in faiths any more? 
Who’ll buy? Who’ll sell?’’ 

What could he mean by such 
words? 

He refused even to consider 
Tleilaxu eyes, although he bought 
them with a lavish hand for the 
men who shared his affliction. 



H unger satisfied, Chani slip- 
ped from bed. She glanced 
back at Paul, noting his tiredness. 
Grim lines framed his mouth. The 
dark hair stood up, mussed from a 
sleep that hadn’t healed. He ap- 
peared so saturnine and remote. 
The back and forth of waking and 
sleeping did nothing to change 
this. She forced herself to turn 
away and whispered: “My love. 
my love ...” 

He leaned over, pulled her 
back into the bed and kissed her 
cheeks. “Soon we’ll go back to 
our desert,” he whispered. “Only 
a few things remain to be done.” 
She trembled at the finality in 
his voice. 



He tightened his arms around 
her. He murmured: “Don’t fear 
me, my Sihaya. Forget mystery 
and accept love. There’s no mys- 
tery about love. It comes from 
life. Can’t you feel that?” 

“Yes.” 

She put a palm against his 
chest, counting his heartbeats. His 
love cried out to the Fremen spirit 
in her— torrential, outpouring, 
savage. A magnetic power enve- 
loped her. 

“I promise you a thing, be- 
loved,” he said. “A child of ours 
will rule such an empire that mine 
will fade in comparison. Such 
achievements of living and art and 
sublime. ” 

“We’re here now!” she pro- 
tested, fighting a dry sob. “And . 
I feel we have so little ... time.” 

“We have eternity, beloved.” 

“You may have eternity. I have 
only now.” 

“But this is eternity.” He 
stroked her forehead. 

She pressed against him, lips 
on his neck. The pressure agitated 
the life in her womb. She felt 
it stir. 

Paul felt it, too. He put a hand 
on her abdomen. “Ahh, little ruler 
of the universe, wait your time. 
This moment is mine.” 

She wondered then why he al- 
ways spoke of the life within her 
as singular. Hadn’t the medics 
told him? She searched back in 
her own memory, curious that 
the subject had never arisen be- 
tween them. Surely, he must know 
she carried twins. She hesitated 
on the point of raising this ques- 



DUNE MESSIAH 



127 



tion. He must know. He knew 
everything. He knew all the things 
that were herself. His hands, his 
mouth - alt of him knew her. 

Presently, she said: “Yes, love. 
This is forever ... this is real.” 
And she closed her eyes tightly 
lest sight of his dark sockets stretch 
her soul from paradise to hell. 
No matter the Rihani magic in 
which he’d enciphered their lives, 
his flesh remained real, his caresses 
could not be denied. 

When they arose to dress for 
the day, she said: “If the people 
only knew your love ...” 

But his mood had changed. 
“You can’t build politics on love,” 
he said. “People aren’t concerned 
with love; it’s too disordered. They 
prefer despotism. Too much free- 
dom breeds chaos. We can’t have 
that, can we? And how do you 
make despotism lovable?” 

“You’re not a despot!” she 
protested, tying her scarf. “Your 
laws are just.” 

“Ahh, laws,” he said. He 
crossed to the window and pulled 
back the draperies as though he 
could look out. “What’s law? 
Control? Law filters chaos and 
what drips through? Serenity? Law 
—our highest ideal and our basest 
nature. Don’t look too closely at 
the law. Do, and you’ll find the 
rationalized interpretations, the le- 
gal casuistry, the precedents of 
convenience. You’ll find the seren- 
ity, which is just another word 
for death.” 

Chani’s mouth drew into a 
tight line. She couldn’t deny his 
wisdom and sagacity, but these 
moods frightened her. He turned 

128 



upon himself and she sensed in- 
ternal wars. It was as though he 
took the Fremen maxim. Never 
to forgive — never to forget!, and 
whipped his own flesh with it. 

She crossed to his side and 
stared past him at an angle. The 
growing heat of the day had be- 
gun pulling the north wind out 
of these protected latitudes. The 
wind painted a false sky full of 
ochre plumes and sheets of crystal, 
strange designs in rushing gold and 
red. High and cold, the wind broke 
against the Shield Wall with foun- 
tains of dust. 

P AUL felt Chani’s warmth be- 
side him. Momentarily, he 
lowered a curtain of forgetfulness 
across his vision. He might just 
be standing here with his eyes 
closed. Time refused to hold still 
for him, though. He inhaled dark- 
ness-starless, tearless. His afflic- 
tion dissolved substance until all 
that remained was astonishment 
at the way sounds condensed his 
universe. Everything around him 
leankl on his lonely sense of hear- 
ing, falling back only when he 
touched objects — the drapery, 
Chani’s hand ... He caught him- 
self listening for Chani’s breaths. 

Where was the insecurity of 
things that were only probable? 
His mind carried such a burden of 
mutilated memories. For every in- 
stant of reality there existed count- 
less projections, things fated never 
to be. An invisible self within him 
remembered the false pasts, their 
burden threatening at times to 
overwhelm the present. 

Chani leaned against his arm. 

GALAXY 



He felt his body through her 
touch — dead flesh carried by time- 
eddies. He reeked of memories 
that had glimpsed eternity. To see 
eternity was to be exposed to eter- 
nity’s whims, oppressed by endless 
dimensions. The oracle’s false im- 
mortality demanded retribution. 
Past and Future became simultan- 
eous. 

Once more, the vision arose 
from its black pit, locked onto 
him. It was his eyes. It moved 
his muscles. It guided him into the 
next moment, the next hour, the 
next day ... until he felt himself 
to be always there\ 

“It’s time we were going,” 
Chani said. “The Council ...” 
“Alia will be there to stand 
in my place.” 

“Does she know what to do?” 
“She knows.” 

A LIA’S day began with a Guard 
squadron swarming into the 
parade yard below her quarters. 
She stared down at a scene of 
frantic confusion, clamorous and 
intimidating babble. The scene be- 
came intelligible only when she 
recognized the prisoner they’d 
brought — Korba, the panygerist. 

She made her morning toilet, 
moving occasionally to the win- 
dow, keeping watch on the pro- 
gress of impatience down there. 
Her gaze kept straying to Korba. 
She tried to remember him as the 
rough and bearded commander of 
the Third Wave in the Battle of 
Arrakeen. It was impossible. Kor- 
ba had become an immaculate fop 
dressed now in a Parato silk robe 



of exquisite cut. It lay open to 
the waist, revealing a beautifully 
laundered ruff and embroidered 
undercoat set with green gems. 
A purple belt gathered the waist. 
The sleeves poking through the 
robe’s armhole slits had been tai- 
lored into rivulet ridges of dark 
green and black velvet. 

A few Naibs had come out to 
observe the treatment accorded a 
fellow Fremen. They’d brought on 
the clamor, exciting Korba to pro- 
test his innocence. Alia moved 
her gaze across the Fremen faces, 
trying to recapture memories of 
the original men. The present blot- 
ted out the past. They’d all become 
hedonists, samplers of pleasures 
most men couldn’t even imagine. 

Their uneasy glances, she saw, 
strayed often to the doorway into 
the chamber where they would 
meet. They were thinking of 
Muad’dib’s blind-sight, a new 
manifestation of mysterious pow- 
ers. By their law, a blind man 
should be abandoned in the desert, 
his water given up to Shai-hulud. 
But eyeless Muad’dib saw them. 
They disliked buildings, too, and 
felt vulnerable in space built above 
^the ground. Give them a proper 
cave cut from rock, then they 
could relax — but not here, not 
with this new Muad’dib waiting 
inside. 

As she turned to go down to 
the meeting, she saw the letter 
where she’d left it on a table by 
the door — the latest message from 
their mother. Despite the special 
reverence held for Caladan as the 
place of Paul’s birth, the Lady 
Jessica had emphasized her refusal 



DUNE MESSIAH 



129 



to make her planet a stop on the 
HajJ. 

“No doubt my son is an ep- 
ochal figure of history,” she’d writ- 
ten, “but I cannot see this as an 
excuse for submitting to a rabble 
invasion.” 

Alia touched the letter, experi- 
encing an odd sensation of mutual 
contact. This paper had been in 
her mother’s hand. Such an ar- 
chaic device, the letter — but per- 
sonal in a way no recording could 
achieve. Written in the Atreides 
Battle Tongue, it represented an 
almost invulnerable privacy of 
communication. 

Thinking of her mpther afflict- 
ed Alia with the usual inward 
blurring. The spice change that 
had mixed the psyches of mother 
and daughter forced her at times 
to think of Paul as a son to whom 
she had given birth. The capsule- 
complex of oneness could present 
her own father as a lover. Ghost 
shadows cavorted in her mind, 
people of possibility. 

A lia reviewed the letter as she 
walked down the ramp to the 
antechamber where her guard Am- 
azons waited., 

“You produce a deadly para- 
dox,” Jessica had written. “Gov- 
ernment cannot be religious and 
self-assertive at the same time. 
Religious experience needs a spon- 
taneity which laws Inevitably sup- 
press. And you cannot govern 
without laws. Your laws eventually 
must replace morality, replace con- 
science, replace even the religion 
by which you think to govern. 
Sacred ritual must spring from 

130 



praise and holy yearnings which 
hammer out a significant morality. 
Government, oa the other hand, 
is a cultural organism particularly 
attractive to doubts, questions and 
contentions. I see the day coming 
when ceremony must take the 
place of faith and symbolism re- 
place morality.” 

The smell of spice coffee greet- 
ed Alia in the antechamber. Four 
Guard amazons in green watch- 
robes came to attention as she 
entered. They fell into step behind 
her, striding firmly in the bravado 
of their youth, eyes alert for trou- 
ble. They had zealot faces un- 
touched by awe. They radiated 
that special Fremen quality of vio- 
lence;. they could kill casually with 
no sense of guilt. 

In this, I am different. Alia 
thought. The Atreides name has 
enough dirt on it without that. 

Word preceded her. A waiting 
Page darted off as she entered the 
lower hall, running to summon the 
full Guard detail. The hall stretch- 
ed out windowless and gloomy, 
illuminated only by a few subdued 
glowglobes. Abruptly, the doors 
to the parade yard opened wide 
at the far end to admit a glaring 
shaft of daylight. The Guard with 
Korba in their midst wavered into 
view from the outside with the 
light behind them. 

“Where is Stilgar?” Alia de- 
manded. 

“Already inside,” one of her 
Amazons said. 

Alia led the way into the cham- 
ber. It was one of the Keep’s more 
pretentious meeting places. A high 
balcony with rows of soft seats 

GALAXY 



occupied one side. Across from 
the balcony, orange draperies had 
been pulled back from tall win- 
dows. Bright sunlight poured 
through from an open space with 
a garden and a fountain. At the 
near end of the chamber on her 
Vight stood a dais with a single 
massive chair. 

Moving to the chair. Alia 
glanced back and up, to see the 
gallery filled with Naibs. 

Household Guardsmen packed 
the open space beneath the gal- 
leiy, Stilgar moving among them 
with a quiet word here, a com- 
mand there. He gave no sign that 
he’d seen Alia enter. 

Korba was brought in, seated 
at a low table with cushions beside 
it on the chamber floor below 
the dais. Despite his finery, the 
panygerist gave the appearance 
now of a surly, sleepy old man 
huddled up in his robes as against 
the outer cold. Two Guardsmen 
took up positions behind him. 

Stilgar approached the dais as 
Alia seated herself. 

“Where is Muad’dib!” he de- 
manded. 

“My brother has delegated me 
to preside as Reverend Mother,” 
Alia said . 

Hearing this, the Naibs in the 
gallery began raising their voices 
in protest. 

“Silence!” Alia commanded. In 
the abrupt quiet, she said: “Is it 
not Fremen law that a Reverend 
Mother presides when life and 
death are at issue!” 

A S THE gravity of her state- 
ment penetrated, stillness came 

DUNE MESSIAH 



over the Naibs, but Alia marked 
angry stares across the rows of 
faces. She named them in her 
mind for discussion in Council — 
Hobars, Rajifiri, Tasmin, Saajid, 
Umbu, Legg . The names carried 
pieces of Dune in them — Umbu 
Sietch, Tasmin Sink, Hobars 
Gap . 

She turned her attention to 
Korba. 

Observing her attention, Korba 
lifted his chin. “I protest my in- 
nocence.” 

“Stilgar, read the charges,” 
Alia said. 

Stilgar produced a brown spice- 
paper scroll and stepped forward. 
He began reading, a solemn flour- 
ish in his voice as though to hid- 
den rhythms. He gave the words 
an incisive quality, clear and full 
of probity — 

"... that you did conspire with 
traitors to accomplish the destruc- 
tion of our Lord and Emperor; 
that you did meet in vile secrecy 
with diverse enemies of the realm; 
that you ...” 

Korba kept shaking his head 
with a look of pained anger. 

Alia listen^ broodingly, chin 
planted on her left fist, head cock- 
ed to that side, the other arm ex- 
tended along the chair arm. Bits 
of the formal procedure began 
dropping out of her awareness, 
screened by her own feelings of 
disquiet. 

“. .". venerable tradition . sup- 
port of the Legions and all Fre- 
men everywhere . violence met 
with violence according to the Law 
. majesty of the Imperial Person 
. forfeit all rights to ... ” 



131 



It was nonsense, she thought. 
Nonsense! All of it — nonsense . 
nonsense . nonsense . 

Stilgar finished: “Thus the is- 
sue is brought to judgment.” 

In the immediate silence, Kor- 
ba rocked forward, hands grip- 
ping his knees, veined neck stretch- 
ing as though he were preparing 
to leap. His tongue flicked be- 
tween his teeth as he spoke. 

“Not by word or deed have 
I been traitor to my Fremen vows! 
I demand to confront my accuser!” 

A simple enough protest, Alia 
thought. 

And she saw that it had pro- 
duced a considerable effect on the 
Naibs. They knew Korba. He was 
one of them. To becpme a Naib, 
he’d proved his Fremen courage 
and caution. Not brilliant, Korba, 
but reliable. Not one to lead a 
Jihad, perhaps, but a good choice 
as supply officer. Not a crusader, 
but one who cherished the old 
Fremen virtues: The Tribe is para- 
mount. 

Otheym’s bitter words as Paul 
had recited them swept through 
Alia’s mind. She scanned the gal- 
lery. Any of those men might see 
himself in Korba’s place— some 
for good reason. But an innocent 
Naib was as dangerous as a guilty 
one here. 

Korba felt it, too. “Who ac- 
cuses me?” he demanded. “I have 
a Fremen right to confront my ac- 
cuser.” 

“Perhaps you accuse yourself,” 
Alia said. 

Before he could mask it, mys- 
tical terror lay briefly on Korba’s 



face. It was there for anyone to 
read: With her powers. Alia had 
but to make accusations, saying 
she brought the evidence from the 
shadow region, the alam al-mythal. 

“Our enemies have Fremen al- 
lies,” Alia pressed. “Water traps 
have been destroyed, qanats blast- 
ed, planting poisonal and storage 
basins plundered ...” 

A nd now — they’ve stolen a 
worm from the desert, taken 
it to another world!” 

The voice of this intrusion was 
known to all of them — Muad’dib. 
Paul came through the doorway 
from the hall, pressed through 
the Guard ranks and crossed to 
Alia’s side. Chani, accompanying 
him, remained on the sidelines. 

“M’Lord,” Stilgar said, refus- 
ing to look at Paul’s face. 

Paul aimed his empty sockets 
at the gallery, then down to Kor- 
ba. “What, Korba — no words of 
praise?” 

Muttering could be heard in 
the gallery. It grew louder, isolated 
words and phrases audible: “ . 
law for the blind . Fremen way 
. .in the desert. .who breaks. .” 
“Who says I’m blind?” Paul 
demanded. He faced the gallery. 
“You, Rajifiri? I see you’re wear- 
ing gold today, and that blue shirt 
beneath it which still has dust on 
it from the streets. You always 
were untidy.” 

Rajifiri made a warding ges- 
ture, three fingers against evil. 

“Point those fingers at your- 
self!” Paul shouted. “We know 
where the evil is!” He turned 



132 



GALAXY 



back to Korba. “There’s guilt on 
your face, Korba.” 

“Not my guilt! 1 may have 
associated with the guilty, but 
not...” He broke off, shot a 
frightened look at the gallery. 

Taking her cue from Paul, Alia 
arose, stepped down to the floor 
of the chamber and advanced to 
the edge of Korba’s table. From a 
range of less than a meter, she 
stared down at him, silent and in- 
timidating. 

Korba cowered under the bur- 
den of eyes. He fidgeted. He shot 
anxious glances at the gallery. 

“Whose eyes do you seek up 
there?” Paul asked. 

“You cannot see!” Korba 
blurted. 

Paul put down a momentary 
feeling of pity for Korba. The man 
lay trapped in the vision’s snare 
as securely as any of those present. 
He played a part, no more. 

“I don’t need eyes to see you,” 
Paul said. And he began describ- 
ing Korba, every movement, every 
twitch, every alarmed and plead- 
ing look at the gallery. 

Desperation grew in Korba. 

Watching him. Alia saw that 
he might break any second. Some- 
one in the gallery must realize 
how near he was to breaking, she 
thought. Who? She studied the 
faces of the Naibs, noting small 
betrayals in the masked faces . 
angers, fears, uncertainties... 
guilts. 

Paul fell silent. 

Korba mustered a pitiful air 
of pomposity to plead: “Who ac- 
cuses me?” 



“Otheym accuses you,” Alia 
said. 

“But Otheym’s dead!” Korba 
protested. 

“How did you know that?” 
Paul asked. “Through your spy 
system? Oh, yes! We know about 
your spies and couriers. We know 
who brought the stone burner here 
from Tarahell.” 

“It was for the defense of the 
Qizarate!” Korba blurted. 

“Is that how it got into traitor- 
ous hands?” Paul asked. 

“It was stolen and we...” 
Korba fell silent, swallowed. His 
gaze darted left and right. “Every- 
one knows I’ve been the voice of 
love for Muad’dib.” He stared 
at the gallery. “How can a dead 
man accuse a Fremen?” 

“Otheym’s voice isn’t dead,” 
Alia said. She stopped as Paul 
touched her arm. 

O THEYM sent us his voice,” 
Paul said. “It gives the 
names, the acts of treachery, the 
meeting places and the times. Do 
you miss certain faces in the Coun- 
cil of Naibs, Korba? Where are 
Merkur and Fash? Keke the Lame 
isn’t with us today. And Takim, 
where is he?” 

Korba shook his head from 
side to side. 

“They’ve fled Arrakis with the 
stolen worm,” Paul said. “Even 
if I freed you now, Korba, Shai- 
hulud would have your water for 
your part in this. Why don”t I 
free you, Korba? Think of all 
those men whose eyes were taken, 
the men who cannot see as I see.

They have families and friends, 
Korba. Where could you hide 
from them?” 

“It was an accident,” Korba 
pleaded. “Anyway, they’re getting 
Tleilaxu ...” Again, he subsided. 

“Who knows what bondage 
goes with metal eyes?” Paul asked. 

The Naibs in their gallery be- 
gan exchanging whispered com- 
ments, speaking behind raised 
hands. They gazed coldly at Kor- 
ba now. 

“Defense of the Qizarate,” 
Paul murmured, returning to Kor- 
ba’s plea. “A device which either 
destroys a planet or produces J- 
rays to blind those too near it. 
Which effect, Korba, did you con- 
ceive as a defense? Does the Qi- 
zarate rely on stopping the eyes 
of all observers?” 

“It was a curiosity, m’Lord,” 
Korba pleaded. “We knew the 
Old Law said that only Families 
could possess atomics, but the Qi- 
zarate obeyed . obeyed ...” 

“Obeyed you,” Paul said. “A 
curiosity, indeed.” 

“Even if it’s only the voice 
of my accuser, you must face me 
with it!” Korba said. “A Fre- 
men has rights.” 

“He speaks truth. Sire,” Stil- 
gar said. 

Alia glanced sharply at Stilgar. 

“The law is the law,” Stilgar 
said, sensing Alia’s protest. He 
began quoting Fremen Law, inter- 
spersing his own comments on 
how the Law pertained. 

Alia experienced the odd sen- 
sation that she was hearing Stil- 
gar’s words before he spoke them. 



How could he be this credulous? 
Stilgar had never appeared more 
official and conservative, more in- 
tent on adhering to the Dune 
Code. His chin was outthrust and 
aggressive. His mouth chopped. 
Was there really nothing in him 
but this outrageous pomposity? 

“Korba is a Fremen and must 
be judged by Fremen Law,” Stil- 
gar conclude. 

A lia turned away, looking out 
at the day shadows dropping 
down the wall across from the 
garden. She felt drained by frustra- 
tion. They’d dragged this thing 
along well into mid-morning. Now, 
what? Korba had relaxed. The 
panygerist’s manner said he’d suf- 
fered an unjust attack, that every- 
thing he’d done had been for love 
of Muad’dib. She glanced at Kor- 
ba, surprising a look of sly self- 
importance sliding across his face. 

He might almost have received 
a message, she thought. He acted 
the part of a man who’d heard 
friends shout: “Hold fast! Help is 
on its way!*’ 

For an instant, they’d held this 
thing in their hands — the informa- 
tion out of the dwarf, the clues 
that others were in the plot, the 
names of informants. But the criti- 
cal moment had flown. Stilgar? 
Surely not Stilgar. She turned to 
stare at the old Fremen. 

Stilgar met her gaze without 
flinching. 

“Thank you, Stil,” Paul said, 
“for reminding us of the Law.” 
Stilgar inclined his head. He 
moved close, shaped silent words 



134

in a way he knew both Paul and 
Alia could read. “I'll wring him 
dry and then take care of the mat- 
ter.” 

Paul nodded, signaled the 
Guardsmen behind Korba. 

“Remove Korba to a maxi- 
mum security cell,” Paul said. 
“No visitors except counsel. As 
counsel, I appoint Stilgar.” 

“Let me choose my own coun- 
sel!” Korba shouted. 

Paul whirled. “You deny the 
fairness and judgment of Stilgar?” 

“Oh, no, m’Lord, but. ” 

“Take him away!” 

The Guardsmen lifted Korba 
off the cushions and herded him 
out. 

With new mutterings, the Naibs 
began quitting their gallery. At- 
tendants came from beneath the 
gallery, crossed to the windows 
and drew the orange draperies. 
A gloom took over the chamber. 

“Paul,” Alia said. 

“When we precipitate vio- 
lence,” Paul said, “it’ll be when 
we have full control of it. Thank 
you, Stil; you played your part 
well. Alia, I’m certain, has identi- 
fied the Naibs who were with him. 
They couldn’t help giving them- 
selves away.” 

“You cooked this up between 
you?” Alia demanded. 

“Had I ordered Korba slain 
out of hand, the Naibs would 
have understood,” Paul said. “But 
this formal procedure without 
strict adherence to Fremen Law — 
they felt their own rights threaten- 
ed. Which Naibs were with him. 
Alia?” 



“Rajifiri for certain,” she said, 
voice low. “And Saajid, but ...” 
“Give Stilgar the complete 
list,” Paul said. 

A lia swallowed in a dry throat, 
sharing the general fear of 
Paul in this moment. She knew 
how he moved among them with- 
out eyes, but the delicacy of it 
daunted her. To see their forms 
in the air of his vision! She sensed 
her person shimmering for him 
in a sidereal time whose accord 
with reality depended entirely on 
his words and actions. He held 
them all in the palm of his vision! 

“It’s past time for your morn- 
ing "audience. Sire,” Stilgar said. 
“Many people — curious ... 
afraid ...” 

“Are you afraid, Stil?” 

It was barely a whisper. “Yes.” 
“You’re my friend and have 
nothing to fear from me.” Paul 
said. 

Stilgar swallowed. “Yes, 
m’Lord.” 

“Alia, take the morning audi- 
ence,” Paul said. “Stilgar, give 
the signal. 

Stilgar obeyed. 

A flurry of movement erupted 
at the great doors. A crow'd was 
pressed back from the shadowy 
room to permit entrance of offi- 
cials. Many things began happen- 
ing all at once — the Household 
Guard elbowing and shoving back 
the press of supplicants, garishly 
robed Pleaders trying to break 
through shouts, curses. Pleaders 
waved the papers of their calling. 
The Clerk of the Assemblage 



DUNE MESSIAH 



135 



strode ahead of them through the 
opening cleared by 'the Guard. He 
carried the List of Preferences, 
those who’d be permitted to ap- 
proach the Throne. The Clerk, a 
wiry Tremen named Tecrube, car- 
ried himself with weary cynicism, 
flaunting his sha\en head and 
clumped whiskers. 

Alia moved to intercept him, 
giving Paul time to slip away with 
Chani through the private passage 
behind the dais. She e.xperienced 
a momentary distrust of Tecrube 
at the prying curiosity in the stare 
he sent after Paul. 

“I speak for my brother to- 
day,” she said. “Have the Sup- 
plicants approach one at a time.” 

“Yes, nTLady.” He turned to 
arrange his throng. 

“I can remember a time when 
you wouldn’t have mistaken your 
brother’s purpose here,” Stilgar 
said. 

“I was distracted,” she said. 
“There’s been a dramatic change 
in you, Stil. What is it?” 

Stilgar drew himself up, shock- 
ed. One changed, of course. But 
dramatically? This was a particular 
view of himself that he’d never 
encountered. Drama was a ques- 
tionable thing. Imported entertain- 
ers of dubious loyalty and more 
dubious virtue were dramatic. Ene- 
mies of the Empire employed 
drama in their attempts to sway 
the fickle populace. Korba had 
slipped away from Fremen virtues 
to employ drama for the Qizarate. 
And he’d die for that. 

“You’re being perverse,” Stil- 
gar said. “Do you distrust me?” 



The distress in his voice soften- 
ed her e.xpression, but not her 
tone. “You know I don’t distrust 
you. I’ve always agreed with my 
brother that once matters were in 
Stilgar’s hands we could safely 
forget them.” 

“Then why do you say I’ve. 
changed?” 

“You’re preparing to disobey 
my brother,” she said. “I can 
read it in you. I only hope it 
doesn’t destroy you both.” 

The first of the Pleaders and 
Supplicants were approaching now. 
She turned away before Stilgar 
could respond. His face, though, 
was filled with the things she’d 
sensed in her mother’s letter — the 
replacement of morality and con- 
science w'ith law. 

“You produce a deadly para- 
dox. ’ ’

Y OU are Bijaz,” the ghola 
said, entering the small 
charhber where the dwarf was held 
under guard. “I am called Hayt.” 
A strong contingent of the 
Household Guard had come in 



136 



‘ GALAXY 



with the ghola to take over the 
evening watch. Sand carried by 
the sunset wind had stung their 
cheeks while they crossed the out- 
er yard and made them blink and 
hurry. They could be heard in the 
passage outside now, exchanging 
the banter and ritual of their tasks. 

“You are not Hayt,” the dwarf 
said. “You are Duncan Idaho. I 
was there when they put your 
dead flesh into the tank and I was 
there when they removed it, alive 
and ready for training.” 

, The ghola swallowed in a 
throat suddenly dry. The bright 
glowglobes of the chamber lost 
their yellowness in the room’s 
green hangings. The light showed 
beads of perspiration on the 
dwarf’s forehead. Bijaz seemed a 
creature of odd integrity, as though 
the purpose fashioned into him by 
the Tleilaxu was projected out 
through his skin. There was power 
beneath the dwarf’s mask of cow- 
ardice and frivolity. 

“Muad’dib has charged me to 
question you to determine what it 
is the Tleilaxu intend you to do 
here,” Hayt said. 

“Tleilaxu, Tleilaxu,” the dwarf 
sang. “I am the Tleilaxu, you 
dolt! For that matter, so are you.” 

Hayt stared at the dwarf. Bijaz 
radiat^ a charismatic alertness 
that made the observer think of 
ancient idols. 

“You hear that guard out- 
side?” Hayt asked. “If I gave 
them the order, they’d strangle 
you.” 

“Hai! Hail” Bijaz cried. 
“What a callous lout you’ve be- 



come. And you said you came 
seeking truth.” 

Hayt found he didn’t like the 
look of secret repose beneath the 
dwarf’s expression. “Perhaps I on- 
ly seek the future,” he said. 

“Well spoke,” Bijaz said. 
“Now, we know each other. When 
two thieves meet they need no in- 
troduction.” 

“So we’re thieves,” Hayt said. 
“What do we steal?” 

“Not thieves, but dice,” Bijaz 
said. “And you came here to 
read my spots. I, in turn, read 
yours. And lo! You have two 
faces!” 

“Did you really see me go into 
the Tleilaxu tanks?” Hayt asked, 
fighting an odd reluctance to ask 
that question. 

“Did I not say it?” Bijaz de- 
manded. The dwarf bounced to 
his feet. “We had a terrific struggle 
with you. The flesh did not want 
to come back.” 



H ayt felt suddenly that he 
existed in a dream controlled 
by some other mind, and that he 
might momentarily forget this to 
become lost in the convolutions 
of that mind. 

Bijaz tipped his head slyly to 
one side and walked all around 
the ghola, staring up at him. “Ex- 
citement kindles old patterns in 
you,” Bijaz said. “You are the 
pursuer who doesn’t want to find 
what he pursues.” 

“You’re a weapon aimed at 
Muad’dib,” Hayt said, swivelling 



DUNE MESSIAH 



137 



to follow the dwarf. “What is it 
you’re to do?” 

“Nothing!” Bijaz said, stop- 
ping. “I''give you a common an- 
swer to a common question.” 
“Then you were aimed at 
Alia,” Hayt said. “Is she your 
target?” 

“They call her Hawt, the Fish 
Monster, on the outworlds,” Bijaz 
said. “How is it I hear your blood 
boiling when you speak of her?” 
“So they call her Hawt,” the 
ghola said, studying Bijaz for any 
clue to his purpose. The dwarf 
made such odd responses. 

. “She is the virgin-harlot,” Bi- 
jaz said. “She is vulgar, witty, 
knowledgeable to a depth that ter- 
rifies, cruel when she is most kind, 
unthinking while she thinks, and 
when she seeks to build she is as 
destructive as a corealis storm.” 
“So you came here to speak 
out against Alia,” Hayt said. 

“Against her?” Bijaz sank to 
a cushion against the wall. “I 
came here to be captured by the 
magnetism of her physical beauty.” 
He grinned, a saurian expression 
on the big-featured face. 

“To attack Alia is to attack 
her brother,” Hayt said. 

“That is so clear it is difficult 
to see,” Bijaz said. “In truth. 
Emperor and sister are one per- 
son back to back, one being, half 
male and half female.” 

“That is a thing we’ve heard 
said by the Fremen of the deep 
desert,” Hayt said. “And those 
are the ones who’ve revived the 
blood sacrifice to Shai-hulud. How 
is it you repeat their nonsense?” 



“You dare say nonsen.se?” Bi- 
jaz demanded. “You,_ who are 
both man and mask? Ahh, but 
the dice cannot read their own 
spots. I forget this. And you are 
doubly confused because you serve 
the Atreides double-being. Your 
senses are not as close to the an- 
swer as your mind is.” 

“Do you preach that false rit- 
ual about Muad’dib to your 
guards?” Hayt asked, his voice 
low. He felt his mind being tangled 
b> the dwarf’s words. 

“They preach to me!” Bijaz 
said. “.And they pray. \\'hy should 
they not'? All of us should pray. 
Do we not live in the shadow of 
the most dangerous creation the 
universe has eser seen?” 
“Dangerous creation?” 

“Their own mother refuses to 
live on the same planet with 
them!” 

W HY don't you answer me 
straight out?" Hayt demand- 
ed. "You know we have other 
ways of questioning you. VV'e'll 
get our answers . one way or 
another." 

“But I have answered you! 
Have I not said the myth is real? 
Am I the wind that carries death 
in its belly? No! I am words! 
Such words as the lightning which 
strikes from the sand in a dark 
sky. I have said: 'Blow out the 
lamp! Day is here!’ And you keep 
saying: ‘Give me a lamp so I can 
find the day.’ ” 

“You play a dangerous game 
with me,” Hayt said. “Did you 
think I could not understand these 



138 GALAXY 



k 



Zensunni ideas? You leave tracks 
as clear as those of a bird in 
mud.” 

Bijaz began to giggle. 

“Why do you laugh?” Hayt 
demand^. 

“Because I have teeth and wish 
I had not,” Bijaz managed be- 
tween giggles. “Having no teeth,. 
I could not gnash them.” 

“And now I know your tar- 
get,” Hayt said. “You were aimed 
at me.” 

“And I’ve hit it right on!” 
Bijaz said. “You made such a big 
target, how could I miss?” He 
nodded as though to himself. 
“Now, I will sing to you.” He 
began to hum a keening, whin- 
ing monotonous theme repeated 
over and over. 

Hayt stiffened, experiencing 
odd pains that played up and 
down his spine. He stared at the 
face of the dwarf, seeing youth- 
ful eyes in an old face. The eyes 
were the center of a network of 
knobby white lines which ran to 
the hollows below his temples. 
Such a large head! Every feature 
focused on the pursed-up mouth 
from which that monotonous noise 
issued. The sound made Hayt 
think^ of ancient rituals, folk mem- 
ories,"old words and customs, half- 
forgotten meanings in lost mutter- 
ings. Something vital was happen- 
ing here — a bloody play of ideas 
across Time. Older ideas lay 
tangled in the dwarf’s singing. It 
was like a blazing light in the 
distance, coming nearer and near- 
er, illuminating life across a span 
of centures. 



“What are you doing to me?” 
Hayt gasped. 

“You are the instrument I was 
taught to play,” Bijaz said. “I am 
playing you. Let me tell you the 
names of the other traitors among 
the Naibs. They are Bikouros and 
Cahueit. There is Djedida, who 
was secretary to Korba. There is 
Abumojandis, the aide to Banner- 
jee. Even now, one of them could 
be sinking a blade into your Muad’ 
dib.” 

Hayt shook his head from side 
to side. He found it too difficult 
to talk. 

“We are like brothers,” Bijaz 
said, interrupting his monotonous 
hum once more. “We grew in the 
same tank; I first and then you.” 

Hayt’s metal eyes inflicted him 
with a sudden burning pain. Flick- 
ering red haze surrounded every- 
thing he saw. He felt he had been 
cut away from every immediate 
sense except the pain, and he 
experienced his surroundings 
through a thin separation like 
wind-blown gauze. All had become 
accident, the chance involvement 
of inanimate matter. His own will 
was no more than a subtle, shift- 
ing thing. It lived without breath 
and was intelligible only as an 
inward illumination. 

W ITH A clarity borne of des- 
peration, he broke through 
the gauze curtain with the lonely 
sense of sight. His attention focus- 
ed like a blazing light upon Bijaz. 
Hayt felt that his eyes cut through 
layers of the dwarf, seeing the little 
man as a hired intellect, and be-

neath that, a creature imprisoned 
by hungers and cravings which 
lay huddled in the eyes — layer 
after layer, until finally, there was 
only an entity-aspect being mani- 
pulated by symbols. 

“We are upon a battleground,” 
Bijaz said. “You may speak of 
it.” 

His voice freed by the com- 
mand, Hayt said: “You cannot 
force me to slay Muad’dib.” 

“I have heard the Bene Ges- 
serit say,” Bijaz said, “that there 
is nothing firm, nothing balanced, 
nothing durable in all the uni- 
verse — that nothing remains in its 
state, that each day, sometimes 
each hour, brings change.” 

Hayt shook his head dumbly 
from side to side. 

“You believed the silly Em- 
peror was the prize we sought,” 
Bijaz said. “How little "you un- 
derstand our masters, the Tlei- 
laxu. The Guild and Bene Ges- 
serit believe we produce artifacts. 
In reality, we produce tools and 
services. Anything can be a tool — 
poverty, war. War is useful be- 
cause it is effective in so many 
areas. It stimulates the metabolism. 
It enforces government. It diffuses 
genetic strains. It possesses a vital- 
ity such as nothing else in the uni- 
verse. Only those who recognize 
the value of war and exercise it 
have any degree of self-determina- 
tion.” 

In an oddly placid voice, Hayt 
said: “Strange thoughts coming 
from you, almost enough to make 
me believe in a vengeful provi- 
dence. What restitution was exact- 



ed to create you? It would make 
a fascinating story, doubtless with 
an even more extraordinary epi- 
logue.” 

“Magnificent!” Bijaz chortled. 
“You attack — therefore you have 
will power and exercise self-deter- 
mination.” 

“You’re trying to awaken vio- 
lence in me,” Hayt said in a 
panting voice. 

Bijaz denied this with a shake 
of the head. “Awaken, yes; vio- 
lence, no. You are a disciple of 
awareness by training, so you have 
said. I have an awareness to awak- 
en in you, Duncan Idaho.” 

“Hayt!” 

"“Duncan Idaho. Killer extraor- 
dinary. Lover of many women. 
Swordsman soldier. Atreides field 
hand on the field of battle. Duncan 
Idahoi” 

“The past cannot ever be 
awakened.” 

“Cannot?” 

“It has never been done!” 

“True, but our masters defy 
the idea that something cannot 
be done. Always, they seek the 
proper 4ool, the right application 
of effort, the services of the 
proper ...” 

“You hide your real purpose! 
You throw up a screen of words 
and they mean nothing!” 

“There is a Duncan Idaho in 
you,” Bijaz said. “It will submit 
to emotion or to dispassionate 
examination, but submit it will. 
This awareness will rise through 
a screen of suppression and selec- 
tion out of the dark past which 
dogs your footsteps. It goads you 



140 



GALAXY 



even now while it holds you back. 
There exists that being within you 
upon which awareness must focus 
and which you will obey.” 

“The Tleilaxu think I’m still 
their slave, but I. ” 

“Quiet, slave!” Bijaz said in 
that whining voice. 

Hayt found himself frozen in 
silence. 



N OW, we are down to bedrock,” 
Bijaz said. “I know you feel 
it. And these are the power words 
to manipulate you ... I think 
they will have sufficient lever- 
age.” 

Hayt felt the perspiration pour- 
ing down his cheeks, the trembling 
of his chest and arms, but he was 
powerless to move. 

“One day,” Bijaz said, “the 
Emperor will come to you. He 
will say: ‘She is gone.’ The grief 
mask will occupy his face. He will 
give water to the dead, as they 
call their tears hereabouts. And 
you will say, using my voice: 
‘Master! Oh, Master!’ ” 

Hayt’s jaw and throat ached 
with the locking of his muscles. 
He could only twist his head in a 
brief arc from side to side. 

“You will say, ‘I carry a mes- 
sage from Bijaz.’” The dwarf 
grimaced. “Poor Bijaz, who has 
no mind... poor Bijaz, a drum 
stuffed with messages, an essence 
for others to use . pound on Bi- 
jaz and he produces a noise...” 
Again, he grimaced. “You think 
me a hypocrite, Duncan Idaho! 
I am not! I can grieve, too. But 



the time has come to substitute 
swords for words.” 

A hiccough shook Hayt. 

Bijaz giggled. “Ah, thank you, 
Duncan, thank you. The demands 
of the body save us. As the Em- 
peror carries the blood of the 
Harkonnens in his veins, he will 
do as we demand. He will turn 
into a spitting machine, a biter 
of words that ring with a lovely 
noise to our masters.” 

Hayt blinked, thinking how the 
dwarf appeared like an alert little 
animal, a think of spite and rare 
intelligence. Harkonnen blood in 
the Atreides? 

“You think of Beast Rabban, 
the vile Harkonnen, and you 
glare,” Bijaz said. “You are like 
the Fremen in this. When words 
fail, the sword is always at hand, 
eh? You think of the torture in- 
flicted upon your family by the 
Harkonnens. And, through his 
mother, your precious Paul is a 
Harkonnen! You would not find 
it difficult to slay a Harkonnen, 
now would you?” 

Bitter frustration coursed 
through the ghola. Was it anger? 
Why should this cause anger? 

“Ohhh,” Bijaz said. “Ahhhh, 
hah! Click-click. There is more 
to the message. It is a trade the 
Tleilaxu offer your precious Paul 
Atreides. Our masters will restore 
his beloved. A sister to yourself — 
another ghola.” 

Hayt felt suddenly that he 
existed in a universe occupied only 
by his own heartbeats. 

“A ghola,” Bijaz said. “It will 
be the flesh of his beloved. She 



DUNE MESSIAH 



141 



will bear his children. She will 
love only him. We can even im- 
prove on the original if he so de- 
sires. Did ever a man have greater 
opportunity to regain what he’d 
lost? It ' is a bargain he will leap 
to strike.” 

B IJAZ nodded, eyes drooping 
as though tiring. Then: “He 
will be tempted . and in his dis- 
traction, you will move close. In 
the instant, you will strike! Two 
gholas, not one! That is what 
our masters demand!” The dwarf 
cleared his throat, nodded once 
more and said: “Speak.” 

“I will not do it,” Hayt said. 

“But Duncan Idaho would,” 
Bijaz said. “It will be the moment 
of supreme vulnerability for this 
descendant of the Harkonnens. Do 
not forget this. You will suggest 
improvements to his beloved — per- 
haps a deathless heart, gentler 
emotions. You will offer asylum 
as you move close to him — a 
planet of his choice somewhere 
beyond the Imperium. Think of 
it! His beloved restored. No more 
need for tears, and a place of idyls 
to live out his years.” 

“A costly package,” Hayt said, 
probing. “He’ll ask the price.” 
“Tell him he must renounce 
his godhead and discredit the Qi- 
zarate. He must discredit himself, 
his sister.” 

“Nothing more?” Hayt asked, 
sneering. 

“He must relenquish his 
CHOAM holdings, naturally.” 
“Naturally.” 

“And if you’re not yet close 



enough to strike, speak of how 
much the Tleilaxu admire what 
he has taught them about the 
possibilities of religion. Tell him 
the Tleilaxu have a department of 
religious engineering, shaping re- 
ligions to particular needs.” 

“How very clever,” Hayt said. 

“You think yourself free to 
sneer and disobey me,” Bijaz said. 
He cocked his head slyly to one 
side. “Don’t deny it ... ” 

“They made you well, little 
animal,” Hayt said. 

“And you as well,” the dwarf 
said. “You will tell him to hurry. 
Flesh decays and her flesh must 
be preserved in a cryological 
tank.” 

Hayt felt -himself floundering, 
caught in a matrix of objects he 
could not recognize. The dwarf 
appeared so sure of himself! There 
had to be a flaw in the Tleilaxu 
logic. In making their ghola, 
th^’d kqy^ him to the voice of 
Bijaz, but . .But what? Logic/ ma- 
trix/object ... How easy it was to 
mistake clear reasoning for correct 
reasoning! Was Tleilaxu logic dis- 
torted? 

Bijaz smiled, listening as 
though to a hidden voice. “Now, 
you will forget,” he said. “When 
the moment comes, you will re- 
member. He will say: ‘She is 
gone.’ Duncan Idaho will awaken 
then.” 

The dwarf clapped his hands 
together. 

Hayt grunted, feeling that he 
had been interrupted in the middle 
of a thought ... or perhaps in the 
middle of a sentence. What was 



142 



GALAXY 



it? Somethinjg about . targets? 

“You think to confuse me and 
manipulate me,” he said. 

“How is that?” Bijaz asked. 

“I am your target and you 
can’t deny it,” Hayt said. 

“I would not think of deny- 
ing it.” 

“What is it you’d try to do 
with me?” 

“A kindness,” Bijaz said. “A 
simple kindness.” 

XX 

The sequential nature of actual 
events is not illuminated with 
lengthy precision by the powers of 
prescience except under the most 
extraordinary circumstances. The 
oracle grasps incidents cut out of 
the historic chain. Eternity moves, 
ft inflicts itself upon the oracle 
and the supplicant alike. Let 
Muad’dib’s subjects doubt his ma- 
jesty and his oracular visions. Let 
them deny his powers. Let them 
never doubt Eternity. 

—The Dune Gospels 

H ayt watched Alia emerge from 
her temple and cross the plaza. 
Her guard was bunched close, fierce 
expressions on their faces to mask 
the lines moulded by good living 
and complacency. 

A heliograph of ‘thopter wings 
flashed in the bright afternoon 
sun above the temple, part of 
the Royal Guard with Maud’dib’s 
fist symbol on the fusilage. 

Hayt returned his gaze to Alia. 
She looked out of place here in 



the city, he thought. Her proper 
setting was the desert — open, un- 
trammeled space. An odd thing 
about her came back to him as 
he watched her approach — Alia 
appeared thoughtful only when she 
smiled. It was a trick of the eyes, 
he decided, recalling a cameo 
memory of her as she’d appeared 
at the reception for the Guild 
Ambassador— haughty against a 
background of music and brittle 
conversation among extravagant 
gowns and uniforms. And Alia 
had been wearing white, dazzling, 
a bright garment of chastity. He 
had looked down upon her from 
a window as she crossed an inner 
garden with its formal pond, its 
Buting fountains, fronds of pampas 
grass and a white belvedere. 

Entirely wrong ... all wrong. 
She belonged in the desert. 

Hayt drew in a ragged breath. 
Alia had moved out of his view 
then as she did now. He waited, 
clenching and unclenching his fists. 
The interview with Bijaz had left 
him uneasy. 

He heard Alia’s entourage pass 
outside the room where he waited. 
She went into the Family quarters. 

Now he tried to focus on the 
thing about her which troubled 
him. The way she’d walked across 
the plaza? Yes. She’d moved like 
a hunted creature fleeing some 
predator. He stepped out onto 
the connecting balcony and walked 
along it behind the plasmeld sun- 
screen, stopping while still in con- 
cealing shadows. Alia stood at 
the balustrade overlooking her 
temple.

He looked where she was 
looking— out over the city. He 
saw rectangles, blocks of color, 
creeping movements of life and 
sound. Structures gleamed and 
shimmered. Heat patterns spiraled 
off the rooftops. There was a 
boy across the way bouncing a 
ball in a cul-de-sac formed by 
a buttressed massif at a corner 
of the temple. Back and forth 
the ball went. 

A lia, too, watched the ball. 

• She felt a compelling identity 
with that ball — back and forth . 
back and forth. She sensed her- 
self bouncing through corridors 
of Time. 

The potion of melange she’d 
drained just before leaving the 
temple was the largest she’d ever 
attempted — a massive overdose. 
Even before beginning to take ef- 
fect, it had terrified her. 

Why did I do it? she asked 
herself. 

One made a choice betv/een 
dangers. Was that it? This was 
the way to penetrate the fog spread 
over the future by that damnable 
Dune Tarot. A barrier existed. 
It must be breached. She had 
acted out of a necessity to see 
where it was her brother walked 
with his eyeless stride. 

The familiar melange fugue state 
began creeping into her awareness. 
She took a deep breath, experienc- 
ing a brittle form of calm, poised 
and selfless. 

Possession of second sight has 
a tendency to make one a dangerous 
fatalist, she thought. Unfortun- 



ately, there existed no abstract 
leverage, no calculus of prescience. 
Visions of the future could not be 
manipulated as formulae. One had 
to enter them, risking life and 
sanity. 

A figure moved from the harsh 
shadows of the adjoining balcony. 
Theghola! In her heightened aware- 
ness, Alia saw him with intense 
clarity — the dark, lively features 
dominated by those glistening metal 
eyes. He was a union of terrifying 
opposites, something put together 
in a shocking, linear way. He was 
shadow and blazing light, a product 
of the process which had revived 
his dead flesh . .and of something 
intensely pure. innocent. 

He was innocence under siege! 

“Have you been there all along, 
Duncan?’’ she asked. 

“So I’m to be Duncan,’’ he 
said. “Why?” 

“Don’t question me,” she said. 

And she thought, looking at 
him, that the Tleilaxu had left 
no corner of their ghola unfinished. 

“Only gods can safely risk per- 
fection,” shesaid. “It’s a dangerous 
thing for a man.” 

“Duncan died,” he said, wish- 
ing she would not call him that. 
“I am Hayt.” 

She studied his artificial eyes, 
wondering what they saw. Obsers'ed 
closely, they betrayed tiny black 
pockmarks, little wells of dark- 
ness in the glittering metal. Facets! 
The universe shimmered around 
her and lurched. She steadied her- 
self with a hand on the sun-warmed 
surface of the balustrade. Ahhh, 
the melange moved swiftly. 



144 



GALAXY 



“Are you ill?” Hayt asked. He 
moved closer, the steely eyes opened 
wide, staring. 

Who spoke? she wondered. Was 
it Duncan Idaho? Was it the mentat- 
ghola or the Zensunni philosopher? 
Or was it a Tleilaxu pawn more 
dangerous than any Guild steers- 
man? Her brother knew. 

Again, she looked at the ghola. 
There was something inactive about 
him now, a latent something. He 
was saturated with waiting and 
with powers beyond their common 
life. 

“Out of my mother, I am 
like the Bene Gesserit,” she said. 
“Do you know that?” 

“I know it.” 

“I use their powers, think as 
they think. Part of me knows 
the sacred urgency of the breed- 
ing program . and its products.” 

S HE blinked, feeling part of 
her awareness begin to move 
freely in Time. 

“It’s said that the Bene Ges- 
serit never let go,” he said. And 
he watched her closely, noting how 
white her knuckles were where 
she gripped the edge of the bal- 
cony. 

“Have I stumbled?” she asked. 
He marked how deeply she 
breathed, with tension in every 
movement, the glazed appearance 
of her eyes. 

“When you stumble,” he said, 
“you may regain your balance 
by jumping beyond the thing that 
tripped you.” 

“The Bene Gesserit stumbled,” 
she said. “Now, they wish to 



regain their balance by leaping 
beyond my brother. They want 
Chani’s baby ... or mine.” 

“Are you with child?” 

She struggled to fix herself in 
a time/ space relationship to this 
question. With child? When? 
Where? 

“I see . my child,” she whis- 
pered. 

She moved away from the bal- 
cony’s edge, turning her head to 
look at the ghola. He had a facet 
of salt, bitter eyes — two circles of 
glistening lead . and, as heturned 
away from the light to follow 
her movement, blue shadows. 

“What ... do you see with such 
eyes?” she whispered. 

“What other eyes see,” hesaid. 
His words rang in her ears, 
stretching her aw'areness. She felt 
that she reached across the universe 
— such a stretching . out . out. 
She lay intertwined with all Time. 

“You’ve taken the spice, a 
large dose,” he said. 

“Why can’t I see him?” she 
muttered. The womb of all crea- 
tion held her captive. “Tell me, 
Duncan, why I cannot see him.” 
“Whom can’t you see?” 

“I cannot see the father of 
my children. I’m lost in a Tarot 
fog. Help me.” 

Mentat logic offered its prime 
computation, and he said: “The 
Bene Gesserit want a mating be- 
tween you and your brother. It 
would lock the genetic ...” 

A wail escaped her. “The egg 
in the flesh,” she gasped. A sensa- 
tion of chill swept over her, fol- 
lowed by intense heat. The unseen 



DUNE MESSIAH 



145 



mate of her darkest dreams! Flesh 
of her flesh that the oracle could 
not reveal — would it come to that? 

“Have you risked a dangerous 
dose of the spice?” he asked. 
Something within him fought to 
express the utmost terror at the 
thought that an Atreides woman 
rnight die, that Paul might face 
him with the knowledge that a 
female of the royal family had 
departed. 

“You don’t know what it’s like 
to hunt the future,” she said. 
“Sometimes I glimpse myself. 
but I get in my own way. I can- 
not ^ee through myself.” She 
lowered her head and shook it 
from side to side. 

“How much of the spice did 
you take?” he asked. 

“Nature, abhors prescience,” 
she said, raising her head. “Did 
you know that, Duncan?” 

H e spoke softly, reasonably, as 
to a small child: “Tell me 
how much of the spice you took.” 
He took hold of her shoulder 
with his left hand. 

“Words are such gross machin- 
ery, so primitive and ambiguous,” 
she said. She pulled away from his 
hand. 

“You must tell me,” he said. 
“Look at the Shield Wall,” she 
commanded, pointing. She sent 
her gaze along her own outstretched 
hand, trembling as the landscape 
crumbled in an overwhelming vision 
— a sandcastle destroyed by in- 
visible waves. She averted her eyes 
and was transfixed by the appear- 
ance of the ghola’s face. His fea- 



tures crawled, became aged, then 
young . aged . young. He was 
life itself, assertive, endless. She 
turned to flee, but he grabbed her 
left wrist. 

“I am going to summon a 
doctor,” he said. 

“No! You must let me have 
the vision! I have to know!” 

“You are going inside now,” 
he said. 

She stared down at his hand. 
Where their flesh touched, she 
felt an electric presence that both 
lured and frightened her. Shejerked 
free to gasp: “You can’t hold the 
whirlwind!” 

“You must have medical help!” 

“Don’t you understand?” she 
demanded. “My vision’s incom- 
plete, just fragments. It flickers 
and jumps. I have to remember 
the future. Can’t you see that?” 

“What is the future if you die?” 
he asked, forcing her gently into 
the Family chambers. 

“Words .. .words,” she mut- 
tered. “I can’t explain it. One 
thing is the occasion of another 
thing, but there’s no cause... no 
effect. We can’t leave the universe 
as it was. Try as we may, there’s 
a gap.” 

“Stretch out here,” he com- 
manded. 

He is so dense! she thought. 

Cool shadows enveloped her. 
She felt her own muscles crawling 
like worms — a firm bed that she 
knew to be insubstantial. Only 
space was permanent. Nothing else 
had substance. The bed flowed 
with many bodies, all of them her 
own. Time became a multiple sen- 



146 



GALAXY 



sation, overloaded. It presented 
no single reaction for her to ab- 
stract. It was Time. It moved. 
The whole universe slipped back- 
ward, forward, sidewise. 

“It Jias no thing-aspect,” she 
explained. “You can’t get under 
it or around it. There’s no place 
to get leverage.” 

There came a fluttering of people 
all around her. Many someones 
held her left hand. She looked 
at her own moving flesh, followed 
a twining arm out to a fluid mask 
of face — Duncan Idaho! His eyes 
were . wrong, but it was Duncan 
— child-man-ad olescent-child-man- 
adolescent . Every line of his 
features betrayed concern for her. 

“Duncan, don’t be afraid,” she 
whispered. 

He squeezed her hand and nod- 
ded. “Be still,” he said. 

And he thought: She must not 
die! She must not! No Atreides 
woman can die! He shook his head 
sharply. Such thoughts defied 
mentat logic. Death was a neces- 
sity that life might continue. 

T he ghola loves me, Alia 
thought. 

The thought became bedrock to 
which she might cling. He was a 
familiar face with a solid room 
behind him. She recognized one of 
the bedrooms in Paul’s suite. 

A fixed, immutable person did 
something with a tube in her throat. 
She fought against retching. 

“We got her in time,” a voice 
said, and she recognized the tones 
of a Family medic. “You should 
have called me sooner.” There was 



suspicion in the medic’s voice. 
She felt the tube slide out of her 
throat — a snake, a shimmering 
cord. 

“The slapshot will make her 
sleep,” the medic said. “I’ll send 
one of her attendants to ... ” 

“I will stay with her,” the 
ghola said. 

“That is not seemly!” the medic 
snapped. 

“Stay . Duncan,” Alia whis- 
pered. 

He stroked her hand to tell 
her he’d heard. 

“M’Lady,” the medic said. “It 
would be best if . ” 

“You do not tell me what is 
best,” she rasped. Her throat ached 
with each syllable. 

“M’Lady,” the medic said, 
voice accusing, "you know the 
dangers of consuming too much 
melange. I can only assume some- 
one gave it to you without ...” 

“You are a fool,” she rasped. 
“Would you deny me my visions? 
I knew what I took and why.^’ 
She put a hand to her throat. 
“Leave us. At once!” 

The medic pulled out of her field 
of vision. He said: “I will send 
word to your brother.” 

She felt him leave and turned 
her attention to the ghola. The 
vision- lay clearly in her awareness 
now, a culture medium in which 
the present grew outward. She 
sensed the ghola move in that play 
of Time, no longer Coptic, fixed 
now against a recognizable back- 
ground. 

He is the crucible, she thought. 
He is danger and salvation. 



DUNE MESSIAH

And she shuddered, knowing 
she saw the vision her brother had 
seen. Unwanted tears burned her 
eyes. She shook her head sharply. 
No tears! They wasted moisture 
and, worse, distracted the harsh 
flow of vision. Paul must be stop- 
ped! Once, just once, she had 
bridged Time to place her voice 
where he would pass. But stress 
and mutibility would not permit 
that here. The web of Time passed 
through her brother now like rays 
of light through a lens. He stood 
at the focus and he knew it. He 
had gathered all the lines to him- 
self and would not permit them 
to escape or change. 

“Why?” she muttered. “Is it 
hate? Does he strike out at Time 
itself because it hurt him? Is that 
it . hate?” 

TTiinking he heard her speak 
his name, the ghola said: 
“M’Lady?” 

“If I could only bum this thing 
out of me!” she cried. “I didn’t 
want to be different.” 

“Please Alia,” he murmured. 
“Let yourself sleep.” 

“I wanted to be able to laugh,” 
she whispered. Tears slid down her 
cheeks. “But I’m sister to an em- 
peror who’s worshipped as a god. 
People fear me. I never wanted 
to be feared.” 

H e wiped the tears from her 
face. 

“I don’t want to be part of 
history,” she whispered. “I just 
want to be loved . and to love.” 
“You are loved,” he said. 
“Ahhh, loyal loyal Duncan.” 



“Please don’t call me that.” 
“But you are,” she said. “And 
loyalty is a valued commodity. It 
can be sold . not bought, but 
sold.” 

“I don’t like your cynicism,” 
he said. 

“Damn your logic! It’s true!” 
“Sleep,” he said. 

“Do you love me, Duncan?” 
“Yes.” 

“Is that one of those lies,” she 
asked, “one of the lies that are 
easier to believe than the tmth? 
Why am I afraid to believe you?” 
“You fear my differences as 
you fear your own.” 

“Be a man, not a mentatV' 
she snarled. 

“I am a mental and a man.” 
“Will you make me your wom- 
an, then?” 

“I will do what love demands.” 
“And loyalty?” 

“And loyalty.” 

“That’s where you’re danger- 
ous,” she said. 

Her words disturbed him. No 
sign of the disturbance arose to 
his face, no muscle trembled — 
but she knew it. Vision-memory 
exposed the disturbance. She felt 
she had missed part of the vision, 
though, that she should remember 
something else from the future. 
There existed another perception 
which did not go precisely by 
the senses, a thing which fell into 
her head from nowhere the way 
prescience did. It lay in the Time 
shadows — infinitely painful. 

Emotion! That was it — emo- 
tion! It had appeared in the vision, 
not directly, but as a product 



148 



GALAXY 



from which she could infer what 
lay behind. She had been pos- 
sessed by emotion — a single con- 
striction made up of fear, grief 
and love. They lay there in the 
vision, all collected into a single 
epidemic body, overpowering and 
primordial. 

“Duncan, don’t let me go,” 
she whispered. 

“Sleep,” he said. “Don’t fight 
it.” 

“I must ... I must. He’s the 
bait in his own trap. He’s the 
servant of power and terror. Vio- 
lence. .deification is a prison en- 
closing him. He’ll lose ... every- 
thing. It’ll tear him apart.” 

“You speak of Paul?” 

“They drive him to destroy 
himself,” she gasped, arching her 
back. “Too much weight, too much 
grief. They seduce him away from 
love.” She sank back to the bed. 
“They’re creating a universe where 
he won’t permit himself to live.” 
“Who is doing this?” 

“He is! Ohhh, you’re so dense. 
He’s part of the pattern. And it’s 
too late . too late . too late ...” 
As she spoke, shefelt her aware- 
ness descend, layer by layer. It 
came to rest directly behind her 
navel. Body and mind separated 
and merged in a storehouse of 
relic visions — moving, moving . 
She heard a fetal heartbeat, a child 
of the future. The melange still 
possessed her, then, setting her 
adrift in Time. She knew she had 
tasted the life of a child "not yet 
conceived. One thing certain about 
this child — it would suffer the same 
awakening she had suffered. It 



would be an aware, thinking en- 
tity before birth.

There exists a limit to the force 
even the most powerful may apply 
without destroying themselves. 
Judging this limit is the true artist- 
ry of government. Misuse of power 
is the fatal sin. The law cannot 
be a tool of vengeance, never a 
hostage, nor a fortification against 
the martyrs it has created. One 
cannot threaten any individual and 
escape the consequences. 

. — Muad’dib on Law 
The Stilgar Commentary 



C HANI stared out at the morn- 
ing desert framed in the fault 
cleft below Sietch Tabr. She wore 
no stillsuit, and this made her 
feel unprotected here in the desert. 
The sietch grotto’s entrance lay 
hidden in the buttressed cliff above 
and behind her. 

The desert ... the desert . She 
felt that the desert had followed 
her wherever she had gone. Com- 
ing back to the desert was not so 
much a homecoming as a turning 
around to see what had always 
been there. 

A painful contraction surged 
through her abdomen. The birth 
would be soon. She fought down 
the pain, wanting this moment 
alone with her desert. 

Dawn stillness gripped the land. 
Shadows fled among the domes 
and terraces of the Shield Wall 
all around. Daylight lunged, over 
the high scarp and plunged her

up to her eyes in a bleak land- 
scape stretching beneath a washed 
blue sky. The scene matched the 
feeling of dreadful cynicism which 
had tormented her since the mo- 
ment she’d learned of Paul’s blind- 
ness. 

Why are we Acre.!’ she wondered. 

It was not a hajra, a journey 
of seeking. Paul sou^t nothing 
here except, perhaps, a place for 
■her to give birth. He had sum- 
moned odd companions for this 
journey, she thought — Bijaz, the 
Tleilaxu dwarf; the ghola, Hayt, 
who might be Duncan Idaho’s 
revenant; Edric, the Guild steers- 
man-ambassador; Gains Helen 
Mohiam, the Bene Gesserit Rever- 
and Mother he so obviously hated; 
Lichna, Otheym’sstrangedaughter, 
who seemed unable to move beyond 
the watchful eyes of guards; Stil- 
gar, her uncle of the Naibs, and 
his favorite wife, Harah . and 
Irulan . Alia . 

The sound of wind through the 
rocks accompanied her thoughts. 
The desert day had become yellow 
on yellow, tan on tan, gray on 
gray. 

Why such a strange mixture 
of companions? 

“We have forgotten,” Paul had 
said in response to her question, 
“that the word ‘company’ origi- 
nally meant traveling companions. 
We are a company.” 

“But what value are they?” 

“There!” he said, turning his 
frightful sockets toward her. 
“We’ve lost that clear, single-note 
of living. If it cannot be bottled. 



beaten, pointed or hoarded, we give 
it no value.” 

Hurt, she’d said: “That’s not 
what I meant.” 

“Ahhh, dearest one,” he’d said, 
soothing, “we are so money-rich 
and so life-poor. I am evil, ob- 
stinate, stupid ...” 

“You are not!” 

“That, too, is true. But my 
hands are blue with time. I think . 
I think I tried to invent life, not 
realizing it had already been in- 
vented.” 

And he’d touched her abdomen 
to feel the new life there. 

DEMEMBERING, she placed 
both hands over her abdomen 
and trembled, sorry that she’d 
asked Paul to bring her here. 

The desert wind had stirred up 
evil odors from the fringe plant- 
ings which anchored the dunes at 
the cliff base. Fremen superstition 
gripped her — evil odors, evil times. 
She faced into the wind, to see 
a worm appear outside the plant- 
ings. It arose like the prow of 
a demon ship out of the dunes, 
threshed sand, smelled the water 
deadly to its kind and fled be- 
neath a long, burrowing mound. 

She hated the water then, in- 
spired by the worm’s fear. Water, 
once the spirit-soul of Arrakis, had 
become a poison. Water brought 
pestilence. Only the desert was 
clean. 

Below her, a Fremen work gang 
appeared. They climbed to the 
sietch’s middle entrance, and she 
saw that they had muddy feet. 



150 



GALAXY 



Fremen with muddy feet! 

The children of the sietch began 
singing to the morning above her, 
their voices piping from the upper 
entrance. The voices made her feel 
time fleeing from her like hawks 
before the wind. She shuddered. 

What storms did Paul see with 
his eyeless vision? 

She sensed a vicious madman 
in him, someone weary of songs 
and polemics. 

The sky, she noted, had become 
crystal gray, filled with alabaster 
rays, bizarre designs etched across 
the heavens by windbome sand. 
A line of gleaming white in the 
south caught her attention. Eyes 
suddenly alerted, she interpreted the 
sign; “White sky in the south; 
Shai-hulud’s mouth.” A storm 
coming, a big wind. She felt the 
warning breeze, a crystal blowing 
of sand against her cheeks. The 
incense of death came on the wind 
— odors of water flowing inqanats, 
sw'eating sand, flint. The water — 
that was why Shai-hulud sent his 
Coriolis wind. 

Hawks appeared in the cleft 
where she stood, seeking safety from 
the wind. They were brown as the 
rocks and with scarlet in their 
wings. She felt her spirit go out 
to them. They had a place to 
hide; she had none. 

“M’Lady, the wind comes!” 

She turned and saw the ghola 
calling to her outside the upper 
entrance to the sietch. Fremen 
fears gripped her. Clean death and 
the body’s water claimed for the 
tribe, these she understood. But 



...something brought back from 
death ... 

Windblown sand whipped at her 
and reddened her cheeks. She 
glanced over her shoulder at the 
frightful band of dust across the 
sky. The desert beneath the storm 
had taken on a tawny, restless ap- 
pearance as though dune waves 
beat on a tempest shore the way 
Paul had once described a sea. 
She hesitated, caught by a feeling 
of the desert’s transience. Measured 
against eternity, this was no more 
than a caldron. Dune surf thun- 
dered against cliffs. 

The storm out there had be- 
come a universal thing for her — 
all the animals hiding from it . 
nothing left of the desert but its 
own private sounds — blown sand 
scraping along rock, a wind surge 
whistling, the gallop of a boulder 
tumbled suddenly from its hill ^ 
then, somewhere out of sight, a 
capsized worm thumping its idiot 
way aright and slithering off to 
its dry depths. 

It was only a moment as her 
life measured time, but in that 
moment she felt this planet being 
swept away — cosmic dust, part of 
other waves. 

W E must hurry,” the ghola said 
from right beside her. She 
sensed fear in him then, concern 
for her safety. 

“It’ll shred the flesh from your 
bones,” he said, as though he 
needed to explain such a storm 
to her. 

Her fear of him dispelled by

his obvious concern, Chani allowed 
the ghola to help her up the rock 
stairway to the sietch. They entered 
the twisting baffle which protected 
the entrance. Attendants opened 
the moisture seals and closed them 
behind. 

Sietch odors assulted her nos- 
trils. The place was a ferment 
of nasal memories — the warren 
closeness of bodies, rank esthers of 
the reclamation stills, familar food 
aromas, the flinty burning of 
machines at work . and through it 
all, the omnipresent spice — me 
lange everywhere. 

She took a deep breath. 
“Home.” 

The ghola took his hand from 
her arm and stood aside, a patient 
figure now, almost as though turned 
off when not in use. Yet... he 
watched. 

Chani hesitated in the entrance 
chamber, puzzled by something she 
could not name. This was truly 
her home. As a child, she’d hunted 
scorpions here by glowglobe light. 
Something was changed, though . 

“Shouldn’t you be going to 
yourquarters, m’Lady?” the ghola 
asked. 

As though ignited by his words, 
a rippling birth constriction seized 
her abdomen. She fought against 
revealing it. 

“M’Lady?” the ghola said. 

“Why is Paul afraid for me 
to bear our child?” she asked. 

“It is a natural thing to fear 
for your safety,” the ghola said. 

She put a hand to her cheek 
where the sand had reddened it. 



“And hedoesn’tfearforthechild?” 
“M’Lady ... he cannot think of 
the child without remembering that 
your firstborn was slain by the 
Sardaukar.” 

She studied the ghola — flat face, 
unreadable mechanical eyes. Was he 
truly Duncan Idaho, this creature? 
Was he friend to anyone? Had he 
spoken truthfully now? 

“You should be with the 
medics,” the ghola said. 

Again, she heard the fear for 
her safety in his voice. She felt 
abruptly that her mind lay un- 
defended, ready to be invaded by 
shocking perceptions. 

“Hayt, I’m afraid,” she whis- 
pered. “Where is my Usui?” 
“Affairs of State detain him,” 
the ghola said. 

S HE nodded, thinking of the 
government apparatus which 
had accompanied them in a great 
flight of ornithopters. Abruptly, she 
realized what puzzled her about the 
sietch — outworld odors. The clerks 
and aides had brought their own 
perfumes into this environment, 
aromas of diet and clothing, of 
exotic toiletries. They were an un- 
dercurrent of odors here. 

Chani shook herself, concealing 
an urge to bitter laughter. Even 
the smells changed in Muad’dib’s 
presence! 

“There were pressing matters 
which he could not defer,” the 
ghola said, misreading her hesita- 
tion. 

“Yes... yes, I understand. I 
came with that swarm, too.” 



152 



GALAXY 



Recalling the flight from Ar- 
rakeen, she admitted to herself now 
that she had not expected to sur- 
vive it. Paul had insisted on piloting 
his own ‘thopter. Eyeless, he had 
guided the machine here. After that 
experience, she knew nothing he did 
could surprise her. 

Another pain fanned out 
through her abdomen. 

The ghola saw her indrawn 
breath and the tightening of her 
cheeks. He said: “Is it yourtime?” 
“I . .yes, it is.” 

“You must not delay,” hesaid. 
He grasped her arm and hurried 
her down the hall. 

She sensed panic in him. She 
said; “No need to rush.” 

He seemed not to hear. “The 
Zensunni approach to birth,” he 
said, urging her along faster, “is 
to wait without purpose in the 
state of highest tension. Do not 
compete with what is happening. 
To compete is to prepare for fail- 
ure. Do not be trapped by the 
need to achieve anything. This 
way, you achieve everything.” 
While he spoke, they reached 
the entrance to her quarters. He 
thrust her through the hangings 
and cried out: “Harah! Harah! 
It is Chani’s time. Summon the 
medics!” 

His call brought attendants run- 
ning. There was a great bustling 
of people in which Chani felt her- 
self an isolated island of calm . 
until the next pain came. 

H ayt, dismissed to the outer 
passage, took time to wonder 



at his own actions. He felt fixated 
at some point of time where all 
truths were only temporary. Panic 
lay beneath his actions, he realized. 
Panic centered not on the pos- 
sibility that Chani might die, but 
that Paul should come to him 
afterward . filled with grief ... his 
loved one . gone . gone. 

Something cannot emerge from 
nothing, the ghola told himself. 
From what does this panic emerge? 

He felt that his mentat faculties 
had been dulled and let out a long, 
shuddering breath. A psychic sha- 
dow passed over him. In the emo- 
tional darkn^s of it, he felt him- 
self waiting for some absolute sound 
— the snap of a branch in a jungle. 

A sigh shook him. Danger had 
passed without striking. 

Slowly, marshaling his powers, 
shedding bits of inhibition, he sank 
into mentat awareness. He forced 
it — not the best way — but some- 
how necessary. Ghost shadows 
moved within him in place of 
people. He was a transshipping 
station for every datum he had 
ever encountered. His being was 
inhabited by creatures of possibil- 
ity. They passed in revue to be 
compared, judged. 

Perspiration broke out on his 
forehead. 

Thoughts with fuzzy edges 
feathered away into darkness — un- 
known. Infinite systems! A mentat 
could not function without realizing 
he worked in infinite systems. Fixed 
knowledge could not surround the 
infinite. Everywhere could not be 
brought into finite perspective. In- 
stead, he must become the infinite

— momentarily. 

In one gestalten spasm, he had 
it, seeing Bijaz seated before him 
blazing from some inner fire. 

Bijaz! 

The dwarf had done something 
to him! 

Hayt felt himself teetering on the 
lip of a deadly pit. He projected 
the mentat computation line for- 
ward, seeing what could develop 
out of his own actions. 

“A compulsion!” he gasped. 
“I’ve been rigged with a com- 
pulsion!” 

A blue-robed courier, passing as 
Hayt spoke, hesitated. “Did you 
say something, sirra?” 

Not looking at him, the ghola 
nodded. “I said everything.” 

xxn 

There was a man so wise. 

He jumped into 

A sandy place 

And burnt out both his 
eyes! 

And when he knew his 
eyes were gone. 

He offered no complaint. 

He summoned up a vision 

And made himself a saint. 

—Children’s Verse 
from History of Muad’dib 

P AUL stood in darkness outside 
the sietch. Oracular vision told 
him it was night, that moonlight 
silhouetted the shrine atop Chin 
Rock high on his left. This was 
a memory-saturated place, his first 
sietch, where he and Chani . 

/ must not think of Chani, he 
told himself. 



The thinning cup of his vision 
told him of changes all around — 
a cluster of palms far down to the 
right, the black-silver line of a 
qanat carrying water th jugh dunes 
piled up by that morr ig’s storm. 

Water flowing in the desert! He 
recalled another kind of water flow- 
ing in a river of his birthworld, 
Caladan. He hadn’t realized then 
the treasure of such a flow, even 
the murky slithering in a qanat 
across a desert basin. Treasure. 

With a delicate cough, an aide 
came up from behind. 

Paul held out his hands for 
a magnaboard with a single sheet 
of metallic paper on it. He moved 
as sluggishly as the qanat’s water. 
The vision flowed, but he found 
himself increasingly reluctant to 
move with it. 

“Pardon, Sire,” the aide said. 
“The Semboule Treaty — your sig- 
nature?” 

“I can read it!” Paul snapped. 
He scrawled Atreides Imper. in the 
proper place and returned the 
board, thrusting it directly into 
the aide’s outstretched hand, aware 
of the fear this inspired. 

The man fled. 

Paul turned away. Ugly, barren 
land! He imagined it sun-soaked 
and monstrous with heat, a place 
of sandslides and thedrowned dark- 
ness of dust pools, blowdevils un- 
reeling tiny dunes across the rocks, 
their narrow bellies full of ochre 
crystals. But it was a rich land, too 
— big, exploding out of narrow 
places with vistas of storm-trodden 
emptiness, rampart cliffs and tum- 
bledown ridges. 



154 



GALAXY 



All it required was water 

and love. 

Life changed those irascible 
wastes into shapes of grace and 
movement, he thought. That was 
the message of the desert. Contrast 
stunned him with realization. He 
wanted to turn to the aides massed 
in the sietch entrance, to shout 
at them; If you need something 
to worship, then worship life — 
all life, every last crawling bit 
of it! We’re all in this beauty 
together! 

They wouldn’t understand. In 
the desert, thQ' were endlessly 
desert. Growing things performed 
no green ballet for them. 

He clenched bis fists at his 
sides, trying to halt the vision. 
He wanted to flee from his own 
mind. It was a beast come to 
devour him! Awareness lay in him, 
sodden, heavy with all the living 
it had sponged up, saturated with 
too many experiences. ^ 

D esperately, Paul squeezed 
his thoughts outward. 

Stars! 

Awareness turned over at 
thought of all those stars above him 
— infinite volume. A man must 
be half mad to imagine he could 
rule even a tear drop of that 
volume. He couldn’t begin to ima- 
gine the number of subjects his 
Imperium claimed. 

Subjects? Worshipers ... and 
enemies more likely. Did any 
among them see beyond rigid be- 
liefs? Where was one man who’d 
escaped the narrow destiny of his 
prejudices? Not even an Emperor 



escaped. He’d lived a take-every- 
thing life, tried to create a uni- 
verse in his own image. But the 
exultant universe was breaking 
across him at last with its silent 
.waves. 

I spit on Dune! he thought. 
I give it my moisture! 

This myth he’d made out of 
intricate movements and imagina- 
tion, out of moonlight and love, 
out of prayers older than Adam, 
and gray cliffs and crimson sha- 
dows, laments and rivers of martyrs 
— what had it come to at last? 
When the waves receded, the shores 
of Time would spread out there 
clean, empty, shining with infinite 
grains of memory and little else. 
Was this the golden genesis of 
man? 

Sand scuffed against rocks told 
him that the ghola had joined him. 

“You’ve been avoiding me to- 
day, Duncan,” Paul said. 

“It’s dangerous for you to call 
me that,” the ghola said. 

“I know.” 

“I . came to warn you, 
m’Lord.” 

“I know.” 

The story of the compulsion 
Bijaz had put on him pour^ from 
the ghola then. 

“Do you know the nature of 
the compulsion?” Paul asked. 

“Violence.” 

Paul felt himself arriving at a 
place which had claimed him from 
the b^inning. Hestood suspended. 
The Jihad had seized him, fixed 
him onto a glidcpath from which 
the terrible gravity of the Future 
would never release him. 



DUNEMESSIAH

“There’ll be no violence from 
Duncan,” Paul whispered. 

“But, Sire. ” 

“Tell me what you see around 
us,” Paul said. 

“M’Lord?” 

“The desert — how is it to- 
night?” 

“Don’t you see it?” 

“I have no eyes, Duncan.” 
“But...” 

“I’ve only my vision,” Paul 
said, “and wish I didn’t have 
it. I’m dying of prescience. Did 
you know that, Duncan?” 

“Perhaps ... what you fear 
won’t happen,” the ghola said. 

“What? Deny my own oracle? 
How can I when I’ve seen it ful- 
filled thousands of times? People 
call it a power, a gift. It’s an 
affliction! It won’t let me leave 
my life where I found it!” 

“M’Lord,” the ghola muttered, 
“I . it isn’t . young master, you 
don’t ... I ... ” He fell silent. 

Paul sensed the* ghola’s con- 
fusion. He said: “What’d you call 
me, Duncan?” 

“What? What? I ... for a mo- 
ment, I . .” 

“You called me ‘young mas- 
ter’.” 

“I did, yes.” 

“That’s what Duncan always 
called me.” Paul reached out and 
touched the ghola’s face. “Was 
that part of your Tleilaxu training?” 
“No.” 

Paul lowered his hand. “What, 
then?” 

“It came from . me.” 

“Do you serve two masters?” 
“Perhaps.” 



“Free yourself from the ghola, 
Duncan.” 

“How?” 

“You’re human. Do a human 
thing.” 

“I’m a ghola!” 

“But your flesh is human. Dun- 
can’s in there.” 

"Something’s in there.” 

“I care not how you do it,” 
Paul said, “but you’ll do it.” 
“You’ve foreknowledge?” 
“Foreknowledge be damned!” 
Paul turned away. His vision 
hurtled forward now, with gaps in 
it, but it wasn’t a thing to be 
stopped . 

“M’Lord, if you’ve. ” 

• “Quiet!” Paul held up a hand. 
“Did you hear that?” 

“Hear what, m’Lord?” 

P AUL shook his head. Duncan 
hadn’t heard it. Had he only 
imagined the sound? It’d been his 
tribal name called from the desert 
— far away and low: “Usui... 
Uuuussssuuuullll ...” 

“What is it, m’Lord?” 

Paul shook his head. He felt 
watched. Sopiething out there in 
the night shadows knew he was 
here. Something? No — someone. 

“It was mostly sweet,” hewhis- 
pered, “and you were the sweetest 
of all.” 

“What’d you say, m’Lord?” 
“It’s the future,” Paul said. 
That amorphous human uni- 
verse out there had undergone a 
spurt of motion, dancing to the 
tune of his vision. It had struck 
a powerful note then. The ghost- 
echoes might endure. 



156 



GALAXY 



“I don’t understand, m’Lord,” 
the ghola said. 

“A Fremen dies when he’s too 
long from the desert,” Paul said. 
“They call it the ‘water sickness.’ 
Isn’t that odd?” 

“That’s very odd.” 

Paul strain^ at memories, try- 
ing to recall the sound of Chani 
breathing beside him in the night. 
Where is there comfort? he won- 
dered. All he could remember, was 
Chani at breakfast the day they’d 
left for the desert. She’d been 
restless, irritable. 

“Why do you wear that old 
jacket?” she’d demanded, eyeing 
the black uniform coat with its 
red hawk crest beneath his Fre- 
men robes. “You’re an Emperor!” 
“Even an Emperor has his fa- 
vorite clothing,” he’d said. 

For no reason he could explain, 
this had brought real tears to 
Chani’s eyes — the second time in 
her life when Fremen inhibitions 
had been shattered. 

Now, in the darkness, Paul 
rubbed his own cheeks and felt 
moisture there. Who gives mois- 
ture to the dead? he wondered. 
It was his own face, yet not his. 
The wind chilled the wet skin. 
A frail dream formed — and broke. 
What was this swelling in his breast? 
Was it something he’d eaten? How 
bitter and plaintive was this other 
self, giving moisture to the dead. 
The wind bristled with sand. The 
skin, dry now, was his own. But 
whose was the quivering which 
remained? 

They heard the wailing then, 
far away in the sietch depths. It 



grew louder . louder . 

The ghola whirled at a sud- 
den glare of light — someone fling- 
ing wide the entrance seals. In the 
light, he saw a man with a raffish 
grin — no! Not a grin, but a grim- 
ace of grief! It was a Fedaykin 
lieutenant named Tandis. Behind 
him came a press of many people, 
all fallen silent now that they saw 
Muad’dib. 

“Chani ...” Tandis said. 

“Is dead,” Paul whispered. “I 
heard her call.” 

H e turned toward the sietch. 

He knew this place. It was 
a place where he could not hide. 
His onrushing vision illuminated 
the entire Fremen mob. He saw 
Tandis, felt the Fedaykin’s grief, 
the fear and anger. 

“She is gone,” Paul said. 

The ghola heard the words out 
of a blazing corona. They burned 
his chest, his backbone, the sockets 
of his metal eyes. He felt his right 
hand move toward the knife at his 
belt. His own thinking became 
strange, disjointed. He was a pup- 
pet held fast by strings reaching 
down from that awful corona. He 
moved to another’s commands, to 
another’s desires. The strings jerked 
his arms, his legs, his jaw. Sounds 
came squeezing out of his mouth, 
a terrifying repetitive noise— 
“Hrrak! Hraak! Hraak!” 

The knife came up to strike. 
In that instant, he grabbed his 
own voice, shaped rasping words: 
“Run! Young master, run!” 

“We will not run,” Paul said. 
“We’ll move with dignity. We’ll

do what must be done.” 

Theghola’s muscles locked. He 
shuddered — swayed. 

“. what must be done!” The 
words rolled in his mind like a 
great fish surfacing. “. what must 
be done!” Ahhh, that had sounded 
like the old Duke, Paul’s grand- 
father. The young master had some 
of the old man in him. “. what 
must be done!” 

The words began to unfold in 
the ghola’s consciousness. A sen- 
sation of living two lives simul- 
taneously spread out through his 
awareness: Hayt/ Idaho/ Hayt/ 
Idaho . He became a motionless 
chain of relative existence, singular, 
alone. Old memories flooded his 
mind. He marked them, adjusted 
them to new understandings, made 
a beginning at the integration of a 
new awareness. A new persona 
achieved a temporary form of inter- 
nal tyranny. The masculating syn- 
thesis remained charged with po- 
tential disorder, but events pressed 
him to the temporary adjustment. 
The young master needed him. 

It was done then. He knew 
himself as Duncan Idaho, remem- 
bering everything of Hayt as though 
it had been stored secretly in him 
and ignited by a flaming catalyst. 
The corona dissolved. He shed the 
Tleilaxu compulsions. 

“Stay close to me, Duncan,” 
Paul said. “I’ll need to depend 
on you for many things.” And, as 
Idaho continued to stand entranced: 
“Duncan!” 

“Yes, I am Duncan.” 

“Of course you are! This was 
the moment when you came back.

I DAHO fell into step besidePaul. 

It was like the old times, yet 
not like them. Now that he stood 
free of the Tleilaxu, he could ap- 
preciate what they had given him. 
Zensunni training permitted him to 
overcome the shock of events. The 
mentat accomplishment formed a 
counterbalance. He put off all fear, 
standing above the source. His 
entire consciousness looked out- 
ward from a position of infinite 
wonder. He had been dead; he 
was alive. 

“Sire,” the Fedaykin Tandis 
said as they approached him, “the 
woman, Lichna, says she must see 
you. I told her to wait.” 

“Thank you,” Paul said. “The 
birth ...” 

“I spoke to the medics,” Tan- 
dis said, falling into step. “They 
said you have two children, both 
of them alive and sound.” 

“Two?” Paul stumbled, catch- 
ing himself on Idaho’s arm. 

“A boy and a girl,” Tandis 
said. “I saw them. They’re good 
Fremen babies.” 

“How... how did she die?” 
Paul whispered. 

“M’Lord?” Tandis bent close. 
“Chani?” Paul said. 

“It was the birth, m’Lord,” 
Tandis replied. “They said her 
body was drained by the speed of 
it. I don’t understand, but that 
is what they said.” 

“Take me to her,” Paul whis- 
pered.

the space MERCHANTS by Frederik Pohl and 
C. M. Kornbluth. Two major advertising agencies 
are nghting for the Venus account — nothing less 
man total control of the Venus economy and mar- 
kets will do. It is completely unimportant that 
Venus IS a harsh, barren, uninhabited planet. 
According to the mentality of Mitchell Courtenay 
of Fowler Schocken Associates, the trick is to per- 
suade colonists to go to Venus, and once there, 
they will have to survive as best they can. One of 
the most savage and devastating attacks on mod- 
ern consumer society and the advertising agents 
tv ho are its high priests, The Space Merchants is 
uncomfortably prophetic.
