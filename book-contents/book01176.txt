"Arthur has done it again — proved that the chief 
ingredient of superior science fiction is story. His sense 
of presence and of real people involved in real 
experiences is unfailing.” Frank Herbert 

"What an absolute pleasure. .Imagine, an astronomical 
story by someone who knows astronomy It was delightful 
to be presented with a scene to stagger the imagination 
and yet have it described so exactly and meticulously 
as to know you have been there.” Isaac Asimov 

"Solid... written so that everyone can enjoy it.. ..As always, 
Arthur C. Clarke pulls some totally unexpected and mighty 
fat rabbits out of the hat. ..while staying meticulously with 
known facts and future possibilities." Robert Heinlein

An Editorial Appeal 

Commencing with the June issues, Galaxy and Worlds of If 
will begin to fully show the results of an entirely new editorial 
policy. For example, the combined author line-up for June reads 
like a Who’s Who of the field: Isaac Asimov, James Blish, Alexei 
and Cory Panshin, Fred Pohl, Lester del Rey, Mack Reynolds, 
Fred Saberhagen, James H. Schmitz, Robert Silverberg, Ted 
Sturgeon, Jack Williamson — and more! No mean list, I think 
you’ll agree. 

Check the contents-pages (themselves so changed as to be 
virtual new features) and you will find several additions. 

Galaxy: Forum, a platform for sf and/or science notables who 
feel they have something important — and interesting! — to convey 
to the readership; Interface, an intermittent series of interviews 
cum thumbnail biographies by Ted Sturgeon (scheduled to begin 
in July with an interview of Roger Elwood); Showcase, (also 
scheduled for July) a non-verbal feature — a new piece of sf-art 
by an acknowledged master, which has as its only justification 
that its creator thinks it’s something special. And of course Book- 
shelf, Directions and Galaxy Stars will continue to flourish as of 
yore — more than yore, in fact. 

Worlds of If: The Alien Viewpoint, an insider’s view of sf. 
Crusty, hard-bitten, cynical old Dick Geis (Editor/Publisher of 
The Alien Critic) lays it on the line — his opinions are not neces- 
sarily those of the management! Ars Gratia, much like Galaxy 
Showcase, but for Up-and-Comers ; Future Perfect, next issue’s 
goodies — at least some of them; The Editor’s Page in June is 
devoted to my personal favorite among the many past editors of 
Worlds of If. In future, it will be what the name implies — the 
editor’s page. And, as with Galaxy, all the old features will re- 
main in residence. 

But all of this takes money, a good deal of it — and the profit 
motive remains an operant factor in the publishing industry. To 






SINCE the writings of Jules Verne and 
H. G. Wells, science fiction— often 
termed “future fiction"— has fasci- 
nated alert minds. Not only has it en- 
tertained. It has predicted much of 
the far-ranging scientific and social 
change now upon us. 

In both GALAXY and IF, the finest 
authors of the genre continue to spec- 



ulate, to predict, to tackle the prime 
problems already shaping tomorrow. 
Ecology— space exploration— nuclear 
promise and threat— energy— social 
evolution and biological revolution— 
these and other fields are probed by 
imaginative stories uniquely exciting 
and rewarding. So let your fancy run 
free. Subscribe now!

ARSEN DARN AY 



I 

O n his twenty-fifth birthday, 
Grom Gravok left Vizillo to go 
on his Maturity Trip. A delegation 
ol elders saw him off, mostly 
younger men; but his father and 
uncles were also in the group, and 
so were his mother, two sisters, and 
Marushka, his bride-to-be. The 
men were misty-eyed and choked 
up at departure time. The women 
cried. Marushka cried most of all. 
Grom was off to the Splendid Free- 
dom. Would he come back to her? 
Grom felt a catch of sadness in his 
throat as he embraced them all, 
Marushka last. Her face was salty, 
her lips soft, and her breath sweet. 
He tore himself away and ran to the 
mouth of the tunnel that fed the TC 
Liner Mulinov. Before he ducked 
into the tube, he turned and waved 
once more. On his shoulder hung a 
red bag labelled Time Collapse In- 
tragalactica. 

The night before the entire go- 
rushkii had gathered to celebrate 
his coming of age. Three hundred 
souls, not counting children, filled 
the basement of Miriam Church on 
38th Level. The tables groaned with 
eighty-five species of fish. Wine 
and cicillo flowed. The flat, the 
deep-bellied, and the triangulated 
ba/ulaikos resounded with the tre- 
molo. By midnight the men formed 
circles and danced the squat-kick 
csanlasnok. slowly at first, hands 
on hips; then faster and faster; the 
watchers clapped their hands and 
cried “Hay! . Hay! . Hay!” 



with every kick. Faces grew red, 
then purple. Total strangers came 
up to Grom and kissed him with 
tears in their eyes. “We’ll miss you 
on the heights,” they said. "Re- 
member us in the Splendid Free- 
dom.” “The mountains,” they said; 
"the prairies blowing in the wind. 
The solid land.” Under the tables 
and in corners little children slept 
with rosy cheeks. The gorushka 
celebrated until dawn. 

He crossed fifty parsecs in three 
weeks. Then Malinov broke from 
Time into Present off the moon. 
They landed within hours. Grom 
took a number for the shuttle and 
checked into El-tuna, the tourist 
class lunar transit hotel. His room 
was two meta wide and four meta 
long. One end had a door, the other 
a curved space-glass window. It 
looked out over the bright gray 
solidity of craters. On the third day 
earth rose over the stark horizon, a 
blue-gray spherical magnificence, 
its face obscured by a tattered veil 
of clouds. 

Every twenty minutes El-tuna 
shook from its foundations up as 
the catapault discharged another 
ship toward the earth. The shuttle 
never rested; seventy-two shots a 
day, without interruption, a thou- 
sand souls a shot for the cheap 
gravity trip to the Mother planet. 
Despite frequent departures, Grom 
waited a week to make the final leg 
of the journey. The station teemed 
with humanity. 

He spent his time in surface ex- 



7 




ploration. El-tuna rented space- 
suits for the purpose and sold maps 
with excursion hikes marked in a 
dotted red line. The space port 
facilities put him off. Luna station 
never slept. It had a worn, soiled, 
grimy look. In the eating places the 
grilles never cooled; the coffee pots 
forever bubbled; the plastic booths 
had an oily feel. He didn’t dare go 
to the shows, even if they had been 
cheap. The Discipline forbade such 
frivolities, and the Splendid Free- 
dom did not begin until his feet 
touched terran soil. 

He liked the vast, solid empty- 
ness of the moon. He took to the 
space-suit in no time at all. It was 
clumsier by far than the grav-suits 
he was so used to. The principles of 
motion were the same. In minutes 
he could run off the horizon and 
leave Luna station behind. Then 
he’d stop and stare at the solidity of 
rock dust. Sometimes he fancied he 
saw the surface move like a wave. 
Sometimes a crater lip threatened 
to spill over like surf. For a man 
from a water planet, the lunar sur- 
face wouldn’t hold still, not unless 
he concentrated on it. 

On the sixth day the red light on 
the intercom was on. A recorded 
voice gave his departure time the 
following day. 

Splendid Freedom, here I come. 

G rom gravok was a structure 
guard. His twenty-fourth year 
was the last year of his apprentice- 
ship. His training had begun at age 



live. When he returned — if he re- 
turned — he’d be a journeyman. He 
wasn’t sure at all that he’d return. 
Some men stayed. Some men left 
Luna for other places after their 
Maturity Trip. Grom had seen re- 
cruiting booths in the lobby of El- 
tuna. Structure men were in de- 
mand all over Milky Way. Not 
everywhere was the Discipline 
strict. He’d even heard of men who 
worked alone. How, he didn’t 
know. But then the elders didn’t 
tell all, by any means. The foreign 
pay was very good if you could be- 
lieve the posters. 

A structure guard worked on 
structures. He built them, he re- 
paired them, and took them apart. 
Above all, he listened to them; he 
listened to them even when he had 
nothing else to do. 

The job called for men who had 
no fear of heights. A good-sized 
structure on Vizillo reached two 
mils into the sky. The topmost 
levels basked in sunshine most of. 
the time, above the clouds. The 
rich lived there. The lower stories 
were nearly always under a leaden 
sky. Vizillo was a water planet. It 
had virtually no land at all, and 
those few tatters carried structures. 
Vizillo circled near the sun and 
solar heat boiled the southern 
ocean up to the sky, and the winds 
drove the water north. The land 
was in the north. In the equatorial 
zone ship-cities floated lazily 
around the globe. The Boaters of 
the South! They knew how to live.

GALAXY 




Grom didn’t know a single struc- 
ture man who didn’t swear he’d re- 
tire on a Floater. But none ever did. 
It hurt to leave the structures or the 
< ’onishka , especially in old age. 

A guard lived by the Discipline. 
They told you From the time you 
were knee-high: without the Discip- 
line you can’t survive in the job. 
Whether on the outside of a struc- 
ture, tloating free above the 
ocean — whose ceaseless motion 
froze into lizzard-skin stillness from 
great height — or in the deep, dark 
internal chasms where the gravitron 
vibes hummed undamped, a man 
had to listen with a psychic ear. 
Everyone heard the gross vibra- 
tions. Only guards “heard” the 
subtle tones of grav. It wasn’t a 
hearing in the ordinary sense. It 
was a knowing. You listened for the 
“little ones,’’ the “lisping.” When 
the lisping stopped, gravitron fail- 
ure threatened. If left unheeded, it 
could lead to structure collapse. 

A structure held at least five 
million people. Grom had heard of 
structures that held three times 
that many, but Vizillo had no 
“giants.” Structure guards were 
much revered. When a guard enter- 
ed a bar, he drank on the house. 
Guards had to cultivate humility. 
Pride made you deaf to the “little 
ones.” 

He began service in a grav-suit 
made for a child. Loose straps tied 
him to his father like twin umbilli- 
cal cords. He overcame his terror in 
a week. A few days later he’d learn- 



ed to stay upright. He held tools for 
his father. By age twelve he heard 
the lisping. The gontshka council 
tested him with a little black box. 
Sometimes it lisped, sometimes it 
just hummed. He passed the test, 
and there was a celebration. 

Discipline flowed from the go- 
ntshka. Vizillo was an Anglo world, 
but all the guards were Slaviros. 
Grom spoke both languages well. 
The Anglos called gorushkas 
“tribes,” and they were that; but 
they were more than that. As the 
grav-drums in the structure gener- 
ated gravitron, so the gontshka 
generated bal. Bal was that subtle 
unity, that sense of hearing, that 
ear for lisping. It came from 
obedience, humility, and brother- 
hood. What the gontshka demand- 
ed of its members was defenseless 
openness. Without it a man went 
deaf. He couldn’t hear his own suit 
fail. He plunged into the depths. 

Twice in his life a guard sailed 
off into the Splendid Freedom — at 
twenty-five, at fifty-five. Away from 
the tribe, stripped of the rules, a 
man could taste life as it was, un- 
constrained. He could test his lust 
for individualized existence, alone, 
free. At twenty-five they went to 
earth at the gorushka's expense. To 
earth, for earth was the supreme 
place of freedom. To earth, be- 
cause earth had mountains, 
prairies, deserts. Land, land. And 
there civilization had created the 
ultimate in human choice. There a 
man could try everything. “ Splen - 



THE SPLENDID FREEDOM

did freedom,” the elders all said. 
“Oh, how magnificent is earth! 
You haven’t lived until you’ve seen 
Terra. It’s the beginning, Grom, 
and it’s the end. Vizillo . why, 
it’s a backwater.” 

The trip cost a hundred and 
eighty thousand dulls, most of that 
for the Time Collapse journey — a 
staggering sum, a great gamble for 
the tribe. The gonishka worked a 
year to pay off the loan. Each man 
gave a tenth of his share. If the man 
didn’t return, the sum was lost. If 
two or three went, the year was 
lean. Lean years, however, were 
part of the Discipline. But so was 
the Maturity Trip. Without it no 
man could become an elder. 

all this went through Grom’s 
r%. head as the shuttle ship, 
lobbed into space by the catapault, 
began its noiseless journey down — 
or was it up? — to earth. UP and 
then down. It was a long trip. The 
qorushka had sent him tourist 
class. 

“They owe it to me,’’ Grom 
thought. He wasn’t there yet, but 
the Splendid Freedom touched his 
face lightly, like an awakening 
breeze. He felt a bit defiant. He 
stretched inner muscles. “They owe 
it to me, and I owe nothing in re- 
turn. I’ve worked on the structures 
twenty years. I’ve listened to the 
song of gravitron. I've slaved some- 
times twenty, thirty, fifty hours on 
the drums without sleep. Many a 
time. I’ve floated in the darkness. 



I’ve floated in the light, right side 
up, wrong side around, above the 
clouds, below them. Once we took 
a section out in the middle of a 
storm. The lightning flashed all 
around us. I think I’ve had enough 
of that life. Who wants to float an- 
other twenty years before he can es- 
cape again? Heeey, freedom. Hey, 
hey! Brothers and sisters, see this 
guard /7v!” 

Then he turned once more to his 
much handled folder, prepared for 
him by the travel agency. In the 
upper right corner they’d printed 
his name in gold letters: Grom Gra- 
vok. He liked that. He’d never had 
anything that was quite his own, 
other than clothes. 

He opened the folder and read at 
random: “. entrusted to the 
care of an experienced Terran 
family, knowledgeable about the 
planet’s resources, sensitive to your 
needs, a guide ever on hand ... or 
not. Cozy Pak gives you the maxi- 
mum flexibility to structure your 
trip your way.” 

He closed the folder. He knew 
the words by heart. “Structure your 
trip . .” Structures kept intrud- 
ing. Thank the Cosmos they had no 
structures on earth. 

The ship plunged into the ocean 
at night. It became a submarine 
and made for the Northanglo con- 
tinent. He was asleep when they 
docked. An attendant shook him 
awake. Sir, sir. 

Welcome to Earth, the Planet of 
Opportunity. The local time is

GALAXY 




three a.m., oh-three-hundred for 
you lucky Space Marines. 

They stumbled down the aisles, a 
little groggy. The attendants stood 
by the exits. They smiled and said 
good morning over and over again. 

Grom found himself in an enor- 
mous hall: shaped concrete walls, 
tiled floors, and an echoing of 
sounds. The letters of the alphabet 
were hung on long rods from the 
ceiling against one side. They flash- 
ed on and off. Many voices, all 
different, called mechanically. “All 
B’s step near.” “All F’s step near.” 
He followed the sultry contralto 
urging the G’s. He stopped at a 
booth beneath the letter. Near the 
booth on a bench sat young men 
and women. He showed his pass- 
port to the girl in the booth. The 
girl turned to the bench. “Gravok,” 
she called. “Anybody here for Gra- 
vok?” 

A young woman in slacks and a 
black silk blouse stirred and put 
out a cigarette. She blew smoke 
from painted lips and came to him. 
She had black, curly hair, green 
earrings shaped like half moons, 
green-tinted eyelids, and long red 
nails. She had a strong fragrance. 

“Grom Gravok?” she asked. 
“Cozy Pak Plan? Hi. I’m the 
daughter of the house. My name’s 
Ebullia, but call me Billy. Say, your 
name isn’t really Grom, is it? Cluny 
name. Makes me think of a guy 
burping. You know, sort of under 
his breath.” 

“Beg your pardon?” 



“Oh, never mind, Grom-sock. 
Pleased to meet you. Let’s get out 
of here and get some sleep. You 
sure picked a time.” 

“My luggage . .” 

“Never mind that. It’ll come by 
vaccutube. We’re all set for tourists 
around here, Grommy. Say, let me 
call you Grommy, kay?” 

And she led the way out. 

Here it was. the Splendid Free- 
dom. Three in the morning, the city 
still hummed with life and ma- 
chinery. It was not unlike a struc- 
ture, seen from the inside, but 
there was no gravitron song here. 
Nothing hung in the sky. All rested 
on rock, vast, solid, endless con- 
tinents of rock. 

They caught a cab. ‘‘Let’s 
splurge,” Billy’d said. The cab 
roared through a tunnel. 

‘‘Let me see your folder, 
Grommy. We just got the fax on 
you last night, no paper work.” 
After a moment’s examination — 
she held up the folder to see by the 
light of neons spaced at intervals 
along the tunnel wall — she gave it 
back to him. ‘‘Shouldn’t have 
splurged,” she stated. ‘‘My, 
Grommy, you’re cutting it tight. 
This is earth, Grom-kid. Say, 
you’re not one of those structure 
guards, are you?” And when he 
nodded: “Boy, will Pop be happy. 
Zoowishy. Zoo-zoowishy.” 

He awoke late the next morning 
in a tiny cubicle. He turned on the 
light and looked about. His bag- 
gage had arrived while he’d slept. 



THE SPLENDID FREEDOM 



11 




The two bags stood next to the 
narrow cot, beside the red shoulder 
bag with white letters that said 
Time Collapse Intragalactica. He 
saw his jump suit draped over what 
now turned out to be an old wash- 
ing machine. He hadn’t noticed 
that the night before. Next to it 
stood a stand with old clothing 
shrouded in plastic. He got up and 
pulled up the shade over the little 
window. But outside it was as dark 
now as it had been when he’d gone 
to bed. He checked his watch. It 
was ten in the morning — ten-hun- 
dred, you lucky Space Marines. He 
had expected to see land, trees. 
Those flying creatures that chirped 
should be about. The blowing grass 
of the prairie. Or something like 
that. 

At the door he hesitated, hearing 
conversation and an unaccustomed 
tone. The bath was to his left. 
“Sand box,” Billy had called it. He 
meant to ask her why. The voices 
came from the right. One of them 
was Billy’s. He listened with the 
door handle in his hand. 

“Bully. Bully. Really bully! Fifty 
thou. Forty-nine five, to be exact. I 
say that’s bully. That’s supposed to 
cover overhead? An A- 14 Cozy 
Pak. Y’ever hear of such a thing? 
They’re not supposed to sell those 
any more, facryn! I’ll ring his neck, 
I will.” 

By the sound that followed, a fist 
rattled china and silver on a table. 

“It’s not his fault, Pops. He 
doesn’t know from nothing.” 



“1 don’t mean him. Peter, that 
rat. Wait till I get hold of little 
Pete. Goddam, Billy, three weeks 
on fifty thou. That’s not a lot of 
activities. What’re we going to do 
with him? Jeez, bird, it’s nothing. 
Peter radded us but good.” 

“You asked him to send us some- 
thing, anything. I heard you on the 
visi.” 

Silence. 

“Fifty thou!’’ The voice was 
incredulous but resigned. For a 
moment no sound penetrated two 
doors and a hallway. Grom smelled 
fried food. “Structure guards!” the 
voice said, in an intonation that 
didn’t signify approval. 

Grom had heard enough to be 
puzzled and disturbed. Fifty thou- 
sand dulls was a fortune on Vizillo. 

He opened the door and went to 
the bath, the shoulder bag in his 
hand. 

When he emerged a door opened, 
and Billy said Hi and asked him to 
meet Pop. Pop wore an undershirt. 
He was bald w ith a crown of hair 
above the ears. He smiled at Grom 
painfully past soiled plates that had 
held fried bird eggs. Grom recog- 
nized the sight and smell from the 
El-tuna eateries. Pop didn’t rise. 
He dabbed ashes from a dead 
cigar. 

“Hya, stranger. I’m the father of 
the house. Just call me Pop, cozy 
like. Ready for your first joy trip, 
are you? Billy!” he called, as a 
master calls a servant, “breakfast 
for the young gentleman. Sit

down . eh . Mr. Grom . 
eh. Gravok.” Pop had Grom’s 
folder to his left and read the name 
on the cover. “Well, how d’you like 
it so far? Billy! Continental break- 
fast, remember? Mr. Grom . 
Gravok is on A-14. A-14, Mr. 
Grom.” He nodded, as if in ap- 
proval. “Healthy and frugal. Fru- 
gality. Very important.” He smiled 
again, as if bothered by a pain. 

“You don’t think fifty thousand 
dulls is a lot of money,” Grom said. 

Pop’s eyes narrowed. Then he 
threw up his hands. “You structure 
guards are all alike. All alike. Jeez, 
you come right out with it, don’t 
you? Pow! Bang! Between the 
eyes.” He lowered his head and 
looked at the yellow smears on his 
plate. He looked up. “Nossir. Fifty 
thou’s chicken feed, if you must 
know. This is earth, Mr. Grom, not 
a cake sale. What’m I gonna do 
with you? Take you on walks? 
Window shopping? Look at it from 
my side a sec. I’m supposed to put 
you up, give you three changes of 
bed linen, feed you, give you a 
guide, and keep you entertained for 
three weeks. Billy here, she can 
earn fifty kay a day with a flusher, 
facryn! 1 don’t know why they do 
this to me.” 

Billy served the continental 
breakfast: two slices of bread, a pat 
of butter, a disk of jam, a cup of 
coffee. 

“Maybe I can stay in a hotel?” 
Grom suggested. He had a distinct 
sense that something was amiss. 



“Zow!” Pop cried. “Oh, zow! 
Are you ever green, kid. Ten kay a 
night in a cheap place. No food. 
Five days and you’re flat.” 

“It may be better to spend five 
days on my own than to impose on 
you.” 

Now Pop’s eyes narrowed again. 
He leaned back and searched for 
matches in his trouser pocket. He 
said: 

“Well, Mr. Grom, I might be 
exaggerating a little, too. It’s not so 
bad, fifty thou. Frugal, but 
enough. Right, Billy?” 

Billy turned from the sink. 
“Sure, Pops.” 

“We’ll show you a nice time, Mr. 
Grom. Just like it says here in the 
contract.” He tapped the folder 
with a thick linger. “You keep your 
side of it, and we keep ours.” 

“In other words,” Grom said, 
“it’s better to have fifty thousand 
than nothing.” 

Pop shook his head. Then he lit 
his cigar. Puffing, he said: “They 
ever teach you about diplomacy, 
kid? Pow,” he said, and he shook 
his head again. 

“I’d like to be on my way,’’ 
Grom said. “We're in the middle of 
a city here. I’d like to get out and 
see something.” 

“Billy, come here. Mr. Grom 
wants to plan his day.” Billy joined 
them at the table. She pushed some 
plates aside and put her chin up on 
her hand. 

“Well, sir?” Pop asked, “what’s 
your pleasure? Sports? Hunting? 



THE SPLENDID FREEDOM 



13 




Historical battles? Mountain climb- 
ing? You name it, we got it . 
while the dulls last, that is. Want to 
ride an elephant? Shoot a tiger? 
Dive for sponge? What’s your thing 
outdoors?” 

“All that around here?" 

"Where else? Just a short trip by 
the undercrust.” 

"Well, for a start I’d just like to 
look around,” Grom said. "I come 
from a water planet. I’d just . 
oh, maybe look at the prairie . 
birds . .” 

“Nature,” Pop said matter-of- 
factly. He looked at the ash on his 
cigar. He gestured with it. "Very 
good choice. Excellent. Frugal. 
Sensible. Yessir. You keep that up, 
Mr. Grom, and we might just 
skinny by. Billy, you heard the 
gentleman. Nature it is. Take him 
to his first activity.” 

Grom asked: “How long a trip is 
that? Should I be ready for an over- 
night stay?” 

"Nothing like that. Five minutes 
from here.” 

"Five minutes? Prairies around 
here? I thought we were quite a 
ways north-east.” 

Pop looked at Grom with some 
puzzlement. “I don’t get you,” he 
said. “We’ve got everything around 
here. Prairies, jungles, deserts, 
mountains, rivers, marshes. You 
name it, kid, we’ve got it . Just 
don’t worry about it,” he continu- 
ed, seeing Grom’s frown. He put 
his cigar down and slapped the 
table with both hands. "Off you go, 



children. The father of the house 
must go to work. I work at the py- 
ramids. Ought to come see them. A 
nice, frugal activity, the pyramids.” 
With that he rose. "Cheeruu,” he 
called, and he waddled out, a 
short, fat little man. 



T hey rode the undercrust toward 
the prairies. The crowded train 
rattled in a narrow tunnel creaking 
and squealing at the turns, now 
slow, now fast. People sat on 
benches, people stood. He and she 
hung on straps and swayed along 
with the car. He chewed beetle 
gum. Billy had insisted it was a real 
thrill and perkpopped you up scoo- 
roolishly in the ayem. It tasted 
sweet, then bitter. And judging by 
its effect on Billy, it colored the 
tongue red. It didn’t perkpop him 
up, scrooroolishly or otherwise. 

He was still puzzled by the geo- 
graphical question. He thought he 
understood something about earth 
geography. Like all others before 
him, he’d studied an old atlas in 
the gorushka library. This vast 
warren was the city of Eastcoast. 
The prairies began a thousand mils 
southwest of here, in the Great 
Plains. Would he see a real prairie 
or just grasslands in the suburbs? 
Pop didn’t inspire him with confi- 
dence. Was this a ruse to save 
money? He decided he’d see. Land 
was land. He needed to orient 
himself. 

The undercrust was very old and 



14 



GALAXY 




rickety. It bumped and rocked. 
The lights went out for seconds at a 
time. But now the lights went out 
altogether, and the train ground to 
a halt; they were surrounded by 
eerie silence. 

“Zoowishy,” he heard Billy say. 
“A zonking power failure . Get 
your paws off me, fatso,” she yelled 
at someone, and he heard a 
slapping sound; then there was a 
sound of motion. ‘‘Runs his hams 
up my leg, the pig. Never fails, 
Grommy . Say, Grommy, you 
interested in Sensuality? It’s cheap, 
you know, what with all the Space 
Marines around here. More Sensy 
shops than any other. Go to a sensy 
shop, fatso!” she yelled at some- 
one; “that's where you should go, 
not molesting working chicks.” 

He waited until her attention 
was, presumably, back on him. 
Then he asked: “What is Sensual- 
ity? What’re you talking about?” 
“Jeez,” she cried, “are you 
people sheltered! You mean it? 
You don’t know? Oh, wow! Half 
the trade that comes to earth comes 
for the Sensy shops, and you want 
to see a prairie!” 

“Tell me,” he said. “You’ve 
aroused my curiosity.” 

“It’s an activity, silly,” she said. 
“You know, sensuous experience. 
If you’re worried about it being a 
sin, forget it, Grommy. It ain’t. All 
fifteen hundred major churches 
have filed exemptions. You don’t 
do anything, but its scooroolish 
fun. I go sometimes on Sundays.” 



“But,” he insisted, “what is it?” 

Some of the people who stood 
around them, people who had en- 
joyed the exchange in silence, now 
snickered. He noticed a rise in the 
temperature. The cooling system 
had cut out. They must be deep 
underground. 

“They sit you down and wire you 
up, you know, just like for a tiger 
hunt, or something, and then you 
can have a grand old time. Girls 
with girls, boys with boys, girls with 
boys, girls with dogs or bulls or . 
you know. They even have an alien 
booth. And it’s only two hundred a 
sesh.” 

“They wire you up,” he said 
flatly. 

“Yeah. Right into your nervy- 
sys. You feel it like you’re it. Wow! 
It’s scooroolish good.” 

The lights came on and the car 
lurched into motion. 

“There he is, see him? That fat 
pig. Yeah, fatsy, turn your head. 
Ought to be ashamed of yourself, 
pawing a decent chick.” 

The object of her anger, a small 
portly man — Grom remembered 
seeing him seated in front of Billy — 
now stood some ways farther up. 
He hid himself behind a newspaper. 
The people around them smiled. 

Grom was puzzled, disoriented. 
He meant to ask her more about 
this business. He’d never heard of 
such a thing and much of what 
she’d said was incomprehensible. 
He’d understood the girls with 
girls, boys with boys part of it. The 



THE SPLENDID FREEDOM

rest was obscure. He waited for the 
screeching wail of wheels to stop. 
The train rounded a curve and ran 
into a station. It rushed past wait- 
ing people on a platform, then 
came to a halt. 

“We’re there,” she said. “Keep 
with me.” 

She elbowed her way through the 
crowd, through the crush of people 
trying to get in. She waited on the 
platform while he followed. Then 
she led the way. He dropped his 
beetle gum into a pole-mounted 
basket as they passed it by. 

They walked in a huge tunnel of 
concrete with a crowd of sullen, 
preoccupied people. Pipes passed 
overhead, and puddles of water or 
oil had accumulated at intervals. 
At spaced distances along the walls 
he saw uniform posters. Each said: 
“Pretty.” 

He pointed. “Those signs. 
What’s the significance of that?” 

“Sublimi ads.” His puzzled face 
made her continue. “You think 
pretty, and the place is pretty.” 

“But this place is ugly,” he pro- 
tested. “Just look at it. Old pipes, 
puddles, dirty walls.” 

“You don’t get it,” she said. 
“It’s pretty, don’t you see? There. 
It says so,” and she pointed to the 
signs. 

Grom didn't know if he should 
take her seriously or not. She was a 
lively lass, but a little on the odd 
side. He expected that “Pretty” was 
a brand name, one she didn’t 
know. 



They walked in silence for a mo- 
ment. Then he spotted, among the 
monotonous “Pretty” signs, one 
that said “Ugly,” 

“And that?” he asked. “What’s 
that?" 

“That’s for variety, silly. Noth- 
ing’s just pretty. That’s not rea- 
listic.” 

F rom the large tunnel they 
passed into a shopping arcade. 
And from the arcade she led the 
way into a side street. She stopped 
before the entrance of a large, non- 
descript building. She looked in her 
purse at a slip of paper, inspected 
the sign above the entrance. It said, 
HOLOCOLOMBO N-58. 

“Here we are,” she announced, 
and she pushed her way into a re- 
volving door beckoning Grom to 
follow. “Wait here,” she said when 
they were inside the place. The 
foyer had red carpeting, wood- 
paneled walls, and dim yellow light 
from a chandelier. She was at a 
booth negotiating with a lady in 
glasses. Presently she was back, 
pointed to the left, and they were in 
motion. 

Was this, he wondered, an ele- 
vator to the surface? He hadn’t 
noticed that they had gained alti- 
tude since disembarking from the 
train. Nor, now that he thought 
about it, had he seen the sky since 
his arrival on earth. That would 
now be corrected. 

Indeed, she led him into an ele- 
vator. She pushed some chits into a 



16 



GALAXY 




slot. The doors closed and they 
surged up. Then the doors opened, 
and there was the prairie, just a 
hallway away, behind glass, an im- 
mense expanse. 

“Let’s take a walk,” she said. 
She opened a glass door, held it for 
him, and he passed out under the 
sky. 

The sun was bright and the wind 
blew with some force. It bent the 
knee-high grass. It chased a few 
clouds across the sky. The' smell 
was overpowering and sweet. He 
didn’t know the names of these 
plants, but there was a profusion of 
them, and their scent was some- 
thing very new. 

He walked out a ways, brushing 
the grass with his hands. Land. So 
much open land. He’d never seen 
solidity from here to the horizon, a 
gentle rolling landscape, some 
small hills in the distance, a little 
village, tall storage tanks of some 
sort, and a truck on the highway 
half a mil to the left. He looked 
back at the glass-fronted building 
they’d just left, a one-story struc- 
ture above the surface. To look at 
it, Grom couldn’t have guessed the 
enormous underground complex 
below. 

Billy had joined him, and he 
turned to her now. 

“Beautiful,” he said, “really 
lovely. I’ll take you up on it. Let’s 
go on a hike.” 

He strode out to his left, toward 
the highway. First he’d explore a 
bit. Then he’d collect some flowers

Blessings on the heads of science-fiction 
fans. They are the marvelous people who 
supply true and valuable scholarship in the 
field. While the academic types are analyz- 
ing such things as average number ofwords 
per sentence in Asimov's writings or find- 
ing new meaningless labels to fit sf in into 
the mainstream, the fans arc publishing 
indices, concordances and mammoth en- 
cyclopedias — and these are the works that 
will be useful for generations. 

One such is A GUIDE TO MIDDLE 
EARTH, by Robert Foster, which we are 
publishing this month. Here is the “one" 
book every devoted Tolkien reader needs, 
indeed has to have — a complete guide to 
Tolkien's fantastic universe. Ail the 
people, places and events in THE LORD 
OF THE RINGS— from Adaldrida 

Brandybuck to Zirak-Zigil — are identified 
and described in detail. 

Best of all, we think, page references to 
LOTR are for the Ballantine edition of the 
trilogy. Our beautiful Tim Kirk cover is 
really a preview of the 1975 TOLKIEN 
CALENDAR — featuring thirteen full color 
paintings by Kirk of scenes from the Tol- 
kien masterpiece. A collector’s item if ever 
we saw one!

Ballantine’s marvelous sf titles are on 
sale wherever paperback books are sold — 
And especially in two terrific stores that 
sell only sf and fantasy. In Los Angeles 
there is something called CHANGE OF 
HOBBIT [1101 Gayley Ave.] . Sherry 
Gottlieb is the lady in charge there. And 
north of the border in Toronto, you’ll find 
BAKKA [282 & 284 Queen Street W.[,

for Marushka. Billy might know if 
the little village had a place to eat. 
They could have lunch there — 
Grom suddenly found himself 
surrounded by darkness. 

The shift was so sudden he 
caught his breath with a small ex- 
clamation. A sense of terror filled 
him, but it was dispelled when he 
heard Billy. 

"Oh, croak,” she cried. “An- 
other power failure. Oh, Grommy, 
you should make them pay for this. 
They owe you double your money 
back and a free activity. All you 
have to do is fill out the forms. And 
your first time, too!” 

His eyes became accustomed to 
the darkness. The darkness was not 
total. He could now make out glow- 
ing signs in four places. They said, 
emergency exit. The placement 
of the signs told him he was in a 
large room, but not very large. Per- 
haps thirty meta in width, fifty 
long. He reached down to touch the 
vegetation. It was still there, but 
the wind had stopped blowing, and 
he could already sense the growing 
heat. 

"Get me out of here, Billy,” he 
said. "Let’s go somewhere where 
we can see and talk. And then you 
tell me all about it. Every last bit.” 
"Zoowishy,” she said, genuinely 
disappointed. "Zoo-zoowishy. I’m 
sorry, truly sorry. Your first activ- 
ity. What a zonk.”

understand. Or maybe it’s Cozy 
Pak Plan I don’t understand. Or 
maybe you don’t understand me.” 
They sat in a coffee shop at a 
two-seater table, she on the uphol- 
stered plasti-leather bench, he on 
the chair. The management pro- 
vided a candle in a glass, whether 
for atmosphere or to anticipate 
power failure he didn’t know. Prob- 
ably the latter. For atmosphere the 
place relied on sublimi ads above 
the purple bench-backs: “Pleasant 
Service, Friendly Feeling.” On 
either side of them were many two- 
man tables occupied by people eat- 
ing lunch. 

Billy smoked a cigarette she’d lit 
on the candle in the glass. It was 
oval in shape and very long and 
blended strictly for working chicks, 
the reason she didn’t offer him one; 
besides she guessed he didn’t 
smoke. They were called “Oh- 
Vuumbs.” 

“No," he said, when she began 
with “Jeez — ,” “don’t tell me. Let 
me ask you some questions. But 
just answer the questions? Please?” 
“It’s your nicky, Grom-kid.” 
“What did 1 see back there?” He 
gestured vaguely. 

“A nature activity.” 

"How’d they make it so real?” 
“Holograph projections. Oh, 
Grom my, don’t you know'? Where 
did you come from, anyway?” 

“Just answer the questions, Billy. 
Pretend I’m stupid. Why did you 
take me to that . activity? Why 
not to a real prairie or park?” 

THE SPLENDID FREEDOM 



“Real?” she asked. 

“Real. Real grass, real sky, real 
sun. Is it because you don’t earn a 
commission on the real thing?” 

She was offended, angry. Who’d 
he think he was, insulting a work- 
ing chick, etc., etc. plus a set of 
slangy exclamations and expletives. 
The real thing! Where’d he think 
he was? On a new planet? This is 
earth, Grom-kid. 

“What do you mean . this is 
earth?” 

“Kay,” she said. “You are dumb. 
Ain’t been any real thing on earth 
for centuries. You think our big 
skulls invented all this marvel stuff 
for fun? You realize what one Sensy 
booth costs to build? Forty-eight.” 
She flicked ash angrily and fixed 
him with those green-lidded eyes. 
“Million. Four eight. Million. 
That’s what. You can see it all 
here. Everything that’s ever been 
on good old Mother Earth. All the 
old battles, all the sights. Pop told 
you he was Pyramids! Didn’t you 
hear him? You can do it all, 
Grom my. Fight the battles, thirst 
in the Sahara, sleep with Merrily- 
roe, eat a shark, be eaten by a 
shark. You can eat a thousand 
meals and never take on a single 
calo. You want to be drunk and not 
be hung over? Milk a cow? Fall into 
a volcano? You can do it here, feel 
it, see it. The whole thing, 
Grom my, and you want the real 
thing!” 

She was very offended. 

“Zillion zillion trillion billion 

19 




dulls or something. That’s what it 
cost to build all this.” Her hand 
swept around to indicate ‘all this.’ 
“Why’d you come here if you think 
it’s all . nothing. The real 
thing!” 

“I didn’t say it was ‘nothing,’” 
he soothed her. ‘‘I didn’t know, is 
all. It’s a custom in my tribe not to 
tell us what it is. Earth, I mean.” 
“Didn’t anybody tell you? On the 
ship?” 

“I hung about with other struc- 
ture guards. 1 heard this and that, 
but I didn’t put it together. I’m a 
simple man, Billy. Vizillo is a 
small, backward planet . Tell 
me, Billy. Is all of earth like this? 
An underground city? Does any- 
body live up on the surface?” 
“Surface? Naw. It’s dangerous 
up there. No life at all.” 

“And Africa, Euras, Astra? 
Cities like this on those continents? 
All with these activity theaters?” 
She shook her head and turned 
to a serving girl who had appeared 
and stared at them grimly. Her 
starched apron had rust stains; her 
black skirt was short over fat 
rumps. “A skinnibug and a glass of 
Mu for me. Chick. Grommy? The 
same.” The waitress left, having 
said nothing at all. 

“Nothing on the other con- 
tinents?” 

“The only city on earth is East- 
coast, and Eastcoast has everything 
that’s ever been. Only better.” 
“Excuse me. Mister, I overheard 
you say you come from Vizillo. I 



meant to ask you — ” 

“Hands off, freak, he’s mine by 
contract. Back to your soupy-soup 
and mind!” 

Billy spoke sharply to the man at 
the neighboring table, a skinny 
fellow in a turtleneck. He had a 
day’s growth of beard. He’d leaned 
over, had put a hand on their table. 

‘‘I’m sure the gentleman can 
speak for himself, chick.” 

‘‘Oh, no you don’t!” Billy 
bristled. “Nossir! Grom-sock, tell 
this mooch to skoot off.” 

Grom shrugged and looked at 
the man. “I don’t know the cus- 
toms here. I don’t mean to offend, 
but . skoot off.” 

“Scavengers!” Billy scolded. 
“Not enough to go around as it is, 
for decent folk. Eight million 
people, three million visitors, less 
than one for three, if you read me, 
Grommy. And the big tour shops 
steal most of those. Little people 
can’t make it any more. There’s 
talk of advertising all the activities. 
They say there’ll be directories and 
all. Pop and I couldn’t make it 
then.” 

“ There is no Mom?” 

“Mom couldn’t take it. She 
blasted off-planet when I was a 
sock.” 

“How do you make a living?” 
“It’s like this, you see,” she said. 
“Only the guides know where all 
the places are. We take the 
mark — ” She stopped and gave him 
a glance, started over. “We take 
the guest to the places where he 



20 



GALAXY 




wants to go. We get a little cut. But 
the big tour shops are taking over. 
They bring a hundred people at a 
crack, cut the commissions. We get 
squeezed. And you can’t just blaze 
oft' like that. What’d we do off- 
planet? Pop and 1? All we know is 
the activities. And guys like this cut 
in on you, tell the guest they know 
some place the guides don’t know 
about. You get it both ways. Pow! 
like Pop says. Between the eyes.” 
Grom sensed her dilemma and 
began to feel sad for her, but he 
rose up above the emotion out of 
old habit. Pity destroyed bal. 

“Y’ou’re a super guide, Billy. 
You'll make it,” he said. 

“Jeez,” she cried, pleased. “How 
can you say that? Your first activity 
and I blew it.” 

“You’re great at explaining and 
you know everything," he said. 
“Tell me, Billy, of my fifty thou- 
sand, how much will you earn?” 
“Six hundred and ninety-six,” 
she said at once. “The ninety-six is 
for your keep, the six hundred is 
commissions.” 

“And what if l don't go to any 
activities?” 

Her face fell. "Zoowish, ’’ she 
cried, “What’d you do?” 

“I don’t know, but I want to ask, 
you that too. Would you get some 
money, commissions?” 

"How?” she asked. “No activity, 
no commission. It’s your nicky, 
Grom my. You spend it, you keep 
it. It’s up to you.” 

She was very gloomy. 



“I don’t have any money. You’ve 
got it. A letter of credit, I think 
they called it in the folder.” 

“It’s still yours. You can cash it 
all in, if you want to. Any office of 
Banco Galactico will give you the 
loot in bills.” 

He mused over that for a second. 

"You don’t want to do that, 
Grom-sock. You won’t have any- 
thing to do. You’ll wander through 
the pretty corridors and look at 
shops just like those you’ve got at 
home . .” Her voice was small. 
She dug into her purse for Oh- 
Vuumbs. 

“I expect to have plenty to do,” 
he said. “And I’ll make sure that 
you’re not hurt, no matter what I 
do.” 

She was unsure. She looked away 
from him. "Where are those 
skinnies?” she asked. “I’m starv- 
ed ... I blew it,” she said, and she 
blew smoke at the candle. “Your 
first activity, and they short it out. 
Oh, mush.” 

He reached out and touched one 
of her hands. "Listen, Billy. It 
wasn’t your fault. And besides, I 
didn’t come to earth to go to 
movies." 

“They aren’t movies!” she pro- 
tested, but he cut her off, squeezing 
her hand. 

“Listen, Billy. Movies, holo- 
grams, it’s all the same. I want to 
go to the surface.” 

“Wow,” she cried. “You must be 
reeling.” 

The expression on her face was 



THE SPLENDID FREEDOM 



21 




so astonished, he decided to drop 
the subject for the moment. 

I nstead, to give her a pleasure, 
Grom agreed to try another ac- 
tivity in the afternoon. 

This time nothing would go 
wrong. 

They’d get away from Nuyo 
burrow where the power always 
failed. Wadicy station was much 
better, she suggested. Did he know? 
Wadicy had been a great capital in 
the ancient days. It’d been called 
The Great American Dream, 
though search her why an empire 
would be called that. All that was 
left of the ancients was part of a 
radiation bunker. And guess what? 
Billy’s eyes lit up. She warmed to 
the subject. She displayed her 
know-how with evident pleasure. In 
a glass case in the bunker Grom 
could see the last surviving imperial 
book; not a fax, not a reconstruct, 
the real thing. It was the report of a 
commission on some important 
subject. “See,” she said, “I know 
some things that aren’t activities. 
But first we’ll take in something 
real scooroolish, kay?” 

They discussed what he should 
do munching the skinnies and 
sipping Mu through straws. Grom 
was used to fish fare and life-pro- 
duced protein. The skinny tasted 
like space-ship food and had been 
grown in a yeast tank. He didn’t 
want to disappoint his guide by 
asking any questions about its 
origins. 



First she explained the difference 
between static and dynamic. She 
used one hand, holding a bite-dis- 
figured skinny, to indicate the one; 
the other hand, which held the Mu, 
to indicate the other. 

Static was what he’d already 
seen. You walked about in them 
and looked. 

Dynamic was where they wired 
you up. 

Dynamic was what he’d have to 
try. She insisted on it. 

In the midst of a long listing of 
different activities, to each of w'hich 
he reacted neutrally at best, she 
suddenly cried: 

“I’ve got it, Grom-kid! I’ve got 
it. I’ll take you to a potpourri!” But 
then her face fell. “Aw, I guess 
not — it’ll run you a mint. Pops’ll 
skin me.” Then her face brightened 
again. “But its the greatest zap- 
peroo there is, Grom. If you like 
Dynamic, that is.” 

“If you say so, Billy, I’ll take you 
to a potpourri.” 

“Me?” she protested. “You can’t 
do that. That’ll wipe you out.” She 
lowered her eyes. “I’ve never been 
to one before. Cause of that.” She 
looked up. “Ten,” she said, fixing 
him with green-lidded eyes. “Thou- 
sand. For you and me. Together.” 

Grom laughed. “It’s only money, 
Billy. Let’s go.” 

Wadicy was an hour away. They 
got there in a much better train. It 
rode on air, went deeper and faster, 
and they had to strap themselves 
into cushioned seats. All the way 



22 



GALAXY 




there, Billy fluctuated between de- 
licious dread at the prospect and 
eager expectation. Grom gathered 
that potpourri was not only scoo- 
roolish, it was also zanyshivereeee! 

The show lasted long hours, and 
in the process the day tied. They 
emerged in the early evening. They 
were both silent for a long time. 

“I’ve never been through this be- 
fore,” she said at last. They stood 
on the platform waiting for the 
train. “You were sweet to buy me a 
chit. Potpourri is a trip. A real trip. 
But 1 don’t think I'd ever do it 
again. It’s too much. It makes you 
feel old. Afterwards, you know.” 

He nodded but didn’t say any- 
thing. 

In the Wadicy potpourri theater, 
you could relive the entire life of a 
man, a woman. The specialty was 
ancient history. You could be the 
man, the woman of that time. It all 
began with birth and ended in 
death. In the four hours that inter- 
vened came the cargo of a lifetime’s 
feeling, a flashing of vast events — 
loves, hatreds, strivings, failures, 
the hubris of success, the dread of 
loneliness and neglect, infirmity, 
sickness, destitution, charity, 
senility, the end. 

Grom had been a journalist 
who’d become a soldier, then a 
general in a terrible war. He was in 
China and Arabia, in Washington, 
in Paris, all around the globe. He 
negotiated a peace that wouldn’t 
hold. He had sweethearts and a 
wife and a child killed by napalm in 



a campus riot. He wrote a book. He 
was member of a cabinet. A mad- 
man gunned him down in front of a 
court house but he recovered with 
one arm lame. A committee investi- 
gated him for corruption; he was 
guilty, found blameless, yet forced 
to resign. He became religious and 
rose high in the ranks of a new 
church; but he lost all of his con- 
version love in vicious hierarchical 
fights. He was banished to an is- 
land and ministered to primitives. 
A shark bit off his lower legs when 
he dived for sponges to supplement 
his income. As he grew old, a native 
matron ruled him and ruled in his 
name with small-eyed cruelty. He 
tried to escape and on the fourth try 
succeeded. He died on a raft on the 
ocean in an ecstasy. He thought he 
was God. 

Grom had left the building 
empty. He was not himself. The 
calm sense of bal was gone or 
stirred to such an extent he couldn’t 
orient himself in the world. Like 
water in a jostled bucket, so his 
emotions slapped the sides of his 
soul and spilled over. He was two 
people: Grom Gravok, structure 
guard, and that strange adventur- 
er, so filled with titanic desire, John 
Singer of the potpourri. The two 
couldn’t be reconciled. The tension 
lamed him. 

The real thing? Whatever it was 
that he’d experienced, it was the 
equivalent of reality. 

He didn’t know who Billy had 
been or what she had experienced; 



THE SPLENDID FREEDOM 



23 




but the effect of the potpourri on 
her was much the same. 

They rode home in silence, 
strapped into cushioned seats, lost 
in ancient yet very recent memories. 

G rom went to bed in the 
narrow room, next to the de- 
commissioned washing machine, 
the stand with old clothing, certain 
that by morning he would be 
normal again. He awoke eight 
hours later still disturbed by the 
very real presence within him of an- 
other person, John Singer. His ner- 
vous system couldn’t distinguish 
between the two sets of memory. 
But Grom Gravok, the structure 
guard, had gained a little strength. 
He knew he had to get away from 
here somehow. He had to find him- 
self again. He yearned for the 
serenity of bal , trembled with basic 
anxiety. No gravitron drums turned 
anywhere on earth. Still he knew 
that he couldn’t have heard the 
“little ones.’’ And that knowledge 
made him extremely nervous. His 
body shuddered with dread. Struc- 
ture collapse could be advancing all 
around him, without his knowledge. 

A strangely serious, taciturn Billy 
took him to a branch of the Banco 
Galactico. She said nothing while 
he cashed in his letter of credit; not 
a word of protest escaped her. She 
had also changed her appearance. 
Her lips, eyelids were no longer 
painted. She had washed the curls 
from her hair. She wore a wide skirt 
and a sweater. She had neglected to 



squirt perfume behind her ears, in 
the crook of her arms. 

Thirty-three thousand dulls were 
left in his account. He folded the 
blue bills away into a zippered 
pocket of his suit. 

Over breakfast in an eatery, he 
told her what he wanted to do. 

She took note of it, thought for a 
moment, checked her watch; then 
she explained how they would pro- 
ceed. They went home and packed 
over night bags; she left a recorded 
message for Pop; then they caught 
an undercrust local to another sta- 
tion and arrived just in time for the 
only transcontinental train of the 
day. He put their bags in the 
overhead rack, her blue one next to 
his red one with the stencilled 
words — Time Collapse Intragalac- 
tiea. They strapped themselves in 
and were soon in motion. A very 
slow start, almost a creeping, be- 
came a headlong rush as the train 
descended very deep into the bed- 
rock on its air-cushioned course. 

J ohn singer had experienced 
his conversion in a small cabin, 
in an out-of-the-way valley of the 
Rocky Mountains, near a town 
called Henderson, in what had then 
been called the State of Colorado. 

He had retired there for a long 
vacation after his ouster from the 
government. He went there to lick 
his wounds, to think things over. 
The cabin belonged to a friend of 
his. It was remote and primitive. 
Singer had to fetch his water from a 



24 



GALAXY 




well and to burn wood in a stove to 
keep warm. 

Grom Gravok had experienced 
Singer’s conversion as if it had been 
his own. For a few months, a very 
lew months. Singer had felt what 
Grom considered a natural state, 
the peace of but. although Singer 
had called it by another name. 
That segment of experience united 
the two personalities. Singer caught 
in the gossamer threads of spirit 
and Grom Gravok in his natural 
state were basically the same man. 

When Grom had awakened the 
morning after his experience of the 
potpourri, two distinct urges had 
impelled him to go to the surface. 
He wished to be free of Singer’s 
oppressive psychic presence, and to 
do so he thought he must see for 
himself the spot where God’s finger 
had touched that ancient. At the 
same time, Grom wished to see 
earth, the real earth, not an under- 
ground city. Eastcoast and struc- 
tures had too much in common. 
Grom longed above all for the sus- 
taining, subtle support of the go- 
rushku. If he couldn’t get that, he 
wanted solitude. 

He learned from Billy that one 
could still go to the mountains. 
Earth had its outposts all about this 
and the other continents — small 
groups of people who watched the 
planet and charted the storms that 
raged above, sampled the atmos- 
phere, measured crust tremors, 
dipped probes into the sea. Slowly 
chaos pressed in upon the remnant 



of humanity. The outposts watched 
the steady progress of the inevi- 
table. 

Someday, Billy had said, there 
would be no more people on earth. 
The oxygen will have been fixed. 

They hurtled toward one of these 
outposts. Den Station in the Ro- 
range. 

The train drove deeply under the 
continent in a tunnel carved by 
plasma and shaped like a slack 
hose, one end attached to Eastcoast 
the other to the underside of the 
mountains. The train fell down, 
almost, moved by gravity. The in- 
ertial energies of the fall carried 
them up again toward the surface 
as the tunnel turned up. 

“So they did learn to do it after 
all." John Singer thought, thinking 
with Grom’s mind; or was this 
Grom’s thought reflecting Singer’s 
memories? In Singer’s day such 
trains were seen as utopian dreams. 
“Some utopia,’’ John Singer 
thought, reflecting on Grom Gra- 
vok’s memories. Or was it the other 
way about? 

Grom found it confusing to be 
two men. But Singer’s memories 
were useful. He understood a great 
deal now he hadn’t grasped before. 

They fell for two hours and rose 
for two hours. 

Grom felt no discomfort. His 
body w as accustomed to all kinds of 
gravitational effects. Billy seemed 
unwell on the way down, but she 
stirred into life on the ascent when 
the natural gravity bit into their 



THE SPLENDID FREEDOM 



25 




bodies and they could unstrap and 
move about. 

“You’re my last visitor,” she an- 
nounced suddenly after a long si- 
lence, stirring coffee a girl had 
brought them on a tray. 

“Oh?” 

“I haven’t lived,” she said 
seriously; her entire manner was 
different now. She was resolute and 
determined. “1 didn’t know it be- 
fore, but now I do. I’m leaving 
earth and heading outward, just 
like Mom.” 

“How’ll you do that? I thought 
you were ...” Grom didn’t want 
to say “poor.” 

“I’ll find a way,” she stated. 
“Mary always did!” 

“Mary?” 

“Mary O'Gronsky. Mary never 
hesitated. She’d just step right out, 
right into the darkness. Something 
always happened.” 

“I take it Mary O’Gronsky was 
the girl whose life you . .?” 

She nodded, lips over a raised 
cup. She set the cup down and took 
a puff on her cigarette. 

“I’m very big,” she said. “I’ve 
seen many things. Earth is too 
small for me. Jeez, Grom,” she 
cried, and the momentary flash of 
enthusiasm recalled for a second 
the Billy he knew, “you’ve no idea 
how big the world is. And here I 
was, hustling in a very narrow 
track, day after day — vaccu the 
place Saturday mornings, a Sensy 
show on Sunday afternoon, and 
grinding, grinding on the old cir- 



cuit. I’m twenty-eight,” she said; 
he didn’t know if it was an accusa- 
tion, a boast, or a statement. 
“Never!” she said. “Never again.” 
She looked at him as if she expect- 
ed contradiction. 

But Grom said nothing. Her 
stare recalled another woman, his 
wife (John Singer’s wife), who on 
the occasion of her twenty-eighth 
birthday (they were flying to the 
Bahamas for a vacation) had quar- 
relled with him (with John Singer) 
about the number of children 
they’d have — she’d wanted none. 
Joan had been a criminal lawyer. 
She’d divorced him after she gave 
birth to Annie. Marushka wanted 
five children, all boys. 

He fell into a reverie about Joan 
and Marushka and Annie all inter- 
twined while Billy went on, assert- 
ing her own future, expanding its 
proportions, explaining the many 
alternate paths that lay before her 
still, each beckoning for explora- 
tion, despite the fact that she had 
nothing, was twenty-eight, and 
couldn’t possibly imagine the first 
step toward her goal. But Mary 
never let herself be stopped. Mary 
blasted rock when the way was 
barred. Yessir! 

Den Station in the Rorange re- 
ceived them with suspicion. They 
had been the only passengers on the 
train to disembark there. A man 
had to unlock a gate to let them 
into the building from the plat- 
form. He asked them to come to his 
office, which they did; Grom 



26 



GALAXY 




carried their bags — her blue one 
and his red one. The man sat down 
behind the desk, took off his 
glasses, polished them, and asked 
what their business was here. They 
stood before him, hadn’t been ask- 
ed to sit down. 

Grom felt strong, overpowering 
irritation. He was John Singer, not 
Grom Gravok. Grom would have 
suppressed such emotions long be- 
fore they could gather force. 

“I want to take a look at the sur- 
face," he said with a voice devoid of 
any supplication. 

Well, now, the man replied. 
Slowly, a little slowly, here. Did 
Mr . .? Mr. Gravok have the 
requisite permits from DOS? 
(DOS, Billy whispered, was the De- 
partment of Safety.) Without such 
a permit, of course, the trip had 
been wasted. The man breathed on 
the lense of his glasses and, polish- 
ing, looked up. 

"I don’t have any permits, so I 
guess you’ll just have to make them 
out, here and now.” 

"Me?" the man said, incredu- 
lous. He put on his glasses to see 
this person better. "Me? Mr. Gra- 
vok, you labor under an immense 
delusion — ’’ 

Grom turned purple. "Get on 
your feet, creep!” he thundered, 
entirely possessed by another. 
“Who do you think you’re address- 
ing, anyway? Can’t you recognize a 
cabinet official when you see one? 
Start writing or you’ll regret you 
ever laid eyes on me.” 



The little man, whom John 
Singer (if not Grom Gravok) had 
recognized as a minor bureaucrat, 
came to his feet. Behind the eyes 
now showed fear. He murmured 
apologies. He hesitated. Then he 
sat down again, dove into a drawer 
for some forms, and began to write 
hastily. It was his job to act 
quickly. Discrete inquiries could be 
made afterward or, better yet, not 
at all. 

Minutes later, armed with forms 
and instructions about the where- 
abouts of lifts, Grom and Billy were 
in yet another concrete corridor. 
Grom’s face was still an angry 
frown. 

"Cabinet official?” Billy asked. 

He looked at her. He was jolted, 
confused. "I . I . .” He gave it 
up and simply shook his head. In 
truth he was mortified by his ag- 
gressive behaviour, and his body 
pulsed with the unaccustomed dis- 
charge of hormones he hadn’t 
known he had, and he longed to be 
rid of John Singer and the terrifying 
slavery of John Singer’s compulsive 
drive. Was this what they called 
freedom? 

From a large encavement on 
which numerous buildings fronted 
and from which other corridors led 
in all directions, they took a right- 
hand path to a smaller square. 
Here they entered a facility where 
attendants equipped them with 
suits, masks, and auxiliary oxygen 
devices. They signed for small 
homing radios, were given maps. 



THE SPLENDID FREEDOM 



27 




They affixed their signatures to lia- 
bility waivers that freed Den Sta- 
tion of any responsibility should 
they be lost. They paid the lift fee of 
five-fifty each. Then they were 
shown to the elevators and went up, 
very high up, in Grom’s estimation; 
which was a way of saying that 
they’d been very deep undercrust. 
And then, from a dark and narrow 
concrete bunker, he stepped out to 
the surface — the real surface this 
time, not a holographic mirage. 

and he saw nothing at all. 

Or rather, he found himself in 
a violent wind storm. The wind 
blew, blasted, raced, cut, shrieked 
by him at an unbelievable velocity. 
It tugged him, pulled him, jerked 
him and yet pressed him back. The 
wind was laden with very fine 
yellow dust. In seconds it powdered 
over his suit and visor. Despite the 
tightness of the suit, a bitter taste 
formed in his mouth. He wiped his 
visor and saw yellow, hurtling 
yellow all about him. 

Grom turned back. He barely 
saw Billy in her dark blue suit. She 
stood uncertainly in the low 
bunker’s rectangular opening. He 
stepped back and took her hand. 
Then, together, they pressed into 
the wind. 

He felt her resistance almost at 
once. Her body seemed to tremble, 
and the trembling came to him 
through her hand, through the 
glove. He held her left. With her 
right hand she fumbled on the 



buttons of her belt-mounted com- 
munications pack. The noise was so 
great that unaided speech was im- 
possible. 

Static crackled. “Oh, Grom, I’m 
scared!" he heard her say. 

“Hold tight. You’re safe. This 
wind must be gusting. It should 
relent. Let’s walk a little.” 

He pulled her along, carefully 
feeling his way over rough, rocky 
terrain while she repeated that she 
was terrified. 

The wind was gusting. From 
time to time its intensity subsided, 
and then they saw churning clouds 
and swirls of yellow dust laced with 
brown dust and whitish dust and 
black spirals of dust. 

Whenever the wind took a breath, 
she seemed to relax a little. 

They walked on, slowly, and as 
time passed he felt the wind die. 
Suddenly it stopped. It left vast 
tons of dust in the air which now 
began to settle slowly like a very 
fine misty rain. 

As fog lifts so the dust settled. 
Minute by minute the view cleared. 
At first they saw dark, grey rock to 
the right. Then more rock piled 
behind that, and rock above that. 
It rose higher and higher. It was 
wild, eroded, chiseled rock, moun- 
tains sliced thin and ground to cir- 
cular posts, flat tables, intricate 
traceries that recalled hot lead 
poured into water. 

But it was the endless plain to 
their left which caused Billy to 
panic. Like Grom she had watched 



28 



GALAXY 




the dust veil drop over the rem- 
nants of Rorange. Then they both 
turned in the other direction. Here 
was a limitless expanse of dust ar- 
ranged in fantastic, numberless, 
sharp-edged dunes. Very far in the 
distance a falling veil of dust per- 
cipitated down from a yellow sky. 

And from that direction they now 
saw the lightning-rapid advance of 
another fist of wind. It punched 
through the veil and ripped 
through the dunes. It came toward 
them, a dark ball of elemental 
force, driving planetary sediment. 

Billy screamed, turned, and ran 
toward the bunker, whose roof was 
unevenly laden with dust as if with 
snow. She stumbled and fell. She 
clawed herself upright. Grom heard 
her sobbing panic over the radio. 
She ran for the safety of the little 
concrete outjutting. He followed 
her slowly, already battered by the 
wind. 

Billy cowered, sobbing, by the 
elevator, her clumsy gloves placed 
in pleading on the door. 

He tried to coax her back to 
rationality, but she was beside her- 
self, incoherent, and utterly 
panicked. At last he rang for the 
lift. When it arrived he half pulled, 
half carried her on. 

They went back down. 

T he following morning Grom 
said good-bye to Billy at the 
train station. 

They shook hands, and he hand- 
ed her the little blue overnight bag. 



On an impulse she embraced him 
and pecked a kiss on his cheek. Her 
eyes glistened. 

“I’ll never forget you, Grom- 
kid,” she said; her voice was husky. 
‘‘You’ve given me a new life.” 

He shook his head. “God be with 
you, Billy. I gave you and you gave 
me. Such is life. Now follow 
through. Do it. Get away.” 

“I will,” she sobbed. 

“Like Mary would. Courage. 
Don’t be held up by anything.” 

“I promise.” 

A girl-attendant at the train’s 
door beckoned. Billy looked at him 
again. She shook her head, filled 
with emotion. Then she turned and 
got on. She waved to him as the 
train pulled away. 

“Zoowishy,” he murmured to 
himself, smiling. “Zoo-zoowishy.” 

Then he went back to the hotel. 

He inspected the gear he had 
bought the day before, following 
that abortive stay on the surface: a 
tent, a mattress, a carrypack; food 
rations, a moisture-capture, a 
stove; rope, heavy socks, thermal 
underwear; a compass, maps, a 
strong radio; and various other 
odds and ends suggested by John 
Singer’s memories or a store clerk 
torn between pleasure at Grom’s 
big purchase and wonder at the 
visitor’s overvaulting madness. 

Grom packed his gear, shoulder- 
ed the load, and set out for the 
surface again. 

He had resolved to spend his re- 
maining time up there, in the awe- 



THE SPLENDID FREEDOM 



29 




some wilderness of the surface. 
He’d known he’d do it in that mo- 
ment of stillness when the dust had 
settled revealing the Mother Plan- 
et’s ravaged face. Alone, up there, 
seeking bal. 

He had bought the gear alone, 
unaided. Billy had been hysterical. 
He’d taken her to a room in Den 
Station’s only hotel aided by a 
heavyset matron with warts and a 
nearly full mustache. And when the 
officious, suspicious matron had at 
last left them alone, he’d consoled 
Billy in a way John Singer would 
have approved and that Mary 
O’Gronsky had known how to 
appreciate. He’d told Billy of his in- 
tentions as they lay together watch- 
ing an artificial sunset projected on 
the wall. Then he’d gone shopping. 
After breakfast the next morning, 
he gave her twenty-five thousand 
dulls — so that she might get free 
and fulfill her dream, or Mary 
O’Gronsky’s dream, or both. Grom 
didn’t care. In his life money didn’t 
matter; nor did John Singer give a 
damn. Singer had created fortunes 
and he’d lost them, like the snap of 
a finger. To Singer money was a 
means. Grom kept enough to get 
home. He already had a ticket. Or 
if he chose to wander, enough for a 
start somewhere. The rest would 
manifest somehow. 

Whether he’d go back to Vizillo 
or head out for parts unknown — 
that was the question he’d answer 
up there. 

Bal would tell him. If he couldn’t 



find bal, he probably wouldn’t 
come back down again. 

T he wind howled and then it 
settled again. It rolled up ten 
thousand carpets of dust and flung 
them into the sky. Sometimes it was 
still for days on end. In the sky tiny 
particles of silicate drew sunshine 
into multichrome reflections. 
Sometimes water clouds filled the 
sky and it rained; it mudded. Tor- 
rents of mud ran. Rivers of mud; 
angry, yellow-foamed rivers that 
bared the rock, that boiled and 
roared and fell over the cliffs with a 
thunder of a few hours and a slow, 
oozing drip of days. 

Grom wandered. 

He went up, into the Rorange. 
He saw forests of petrified wood. 
He saw art so strange only the 
unencumbered freedom of wind 
blast could create it over centuries. 
He saw lakes and pools whose water 
was bitter. He saw tough, rocklike 
vegetable scum clinging for dear 
life to rock, to occasional mudriver 
beds. He saw needles of stone and 
spires of stone and temples of 
stone. He saw boulders balanced on 
needles of stone and needles bal- 
anced on boulders. 

He wandered, but with a system. 
He sought with compass and 
map the spot where John Singer 
had been touched by the Divine 
finger. There was no practical sense 
in the search. Since Singer’s day 
the Rocky Mountains had been so 
utterly changed Grom didn’t recog- 



30 



GALAXY 




nizc the place nor the maps that 
^ave him an overview. He couldn’t 
he sure where that spot was. There 
was no common point of reference 
except Den Station, in Singer’s day 
a major city. One point. Not 
enough except to aid a guess. Yet 
Grom searched. He knew he’d 
know the spot. And if it wasn’t 
really that spot, it didn’t matter. 
( Jod was everywhere. He interpene- 
trated this dimension. The value of 
(lie exercise was that it gave Grom 
things to do — map study in the tent 
at night, compass readings in the 
day time, measuring and charting 
with a grease pencil on a plastic 
overlay. 

He reached the spot on the tenth 
day out. He camped near the edge 
of a funnel-shaped valley, a triple 
column of stone behind him, the 
remnants of Tomichi mountain (he 
guessed). Across the funnel was a 
wall of rock. It seemed he remem- 
bered that wall. In Singer’s days it 
had been higher and pines had run 
like a line of soldiers right to the 
edge of it. An over-eager soldier or 
two had tumbled down and caught 
himself in cracks and crevices. 
That red was the ancient red. That 
grey with a nose shape the ancient 
nose. 

He stayed for three weeks. Or 
possibly only for three days. Time 
was meaningless here. He wander- 
ed about. He ranged far from his 
camp. Slowly, very slowly, he began 
to feel like himself again. 

After ten days, or possibly two, 



he got the notion that he’d find a 
souvenir for Marushka. This mis- 
sion began to fill his waking hours. 
He searched and searched. Some- 
thing very, very ancient. Something 
of real value. Something they’d en- 
case in clear glass and place next to 
the gorushka shrine in their cubo- 
home. Something that would be a 
memento of his Maturity Trip and 
yet a gift from him to her. Some- 
thing they’d show to the five 
children Maruska wanted, all five 
of them boys, all five structure 
guards with clear ears for the lisp of 
gravitron. 

He wandered about with a small 
pick axe and dug here and there, 
lifting and piling the dust — loose 
on top, packed deeper, then almost 
the solidity of rock down below. For 
a long time he found nothing. 

Then one day he lifted a flat- 
pressed cake of dust and saw the 
corner of a something with a dull, 
metallic sheen. He freed the some- 
thing. It was a piece of light, 
maleable metal ironed flat by pres- 
sure. Aluminum, by the feel and 
look. Once it might have been cy- 
lindrical in shape. It was only part 
of a cylinder, torn from a cylinder. 
The pressure had forced wrinkles 
into the surface. 

He carried his find to the tent. 
He washed it with sweet water from 
the moisture-capture. He polished 
it with one of his heavy socks. He 
examined it in the beam of a flash- 
light. With tremendous joy and ex- 
citement he then saw the faded 



THE SPLENDID FREEDOM

trace of very ancient letters. 
Singer's memories allowed him to 
decipher the sound. The letters, a 
mere discoloration on the metal, a 
faint but unmistakeable impression 
or chemical change on the surface, 
said “Coca ola.’’ Faintly Grom 
seemed to recall the significance of 
the words, but his Singer-self was 
receeding. The new yet ancient 
memories did not come as readily 
any more. All that was left of 
Singer was a feeling — a strange, 
troubled, sad feeling of something 
that had longed, hated, suffered, 
and passed on. 

He wrapped the metal in one of 
his shirts. He tied a rope about the 
shirt to secure the metal. He placed 
the shirt at the bottom of his pack. 
Then he cooked himself a meal on 
the stove and went to bed on his 
mattress. 

The next day he awoke with 
dawn. The day was still. The sun 
gleamed in the silicate suspension 
of the air. 

Grom distinctly felt in his heart 
the peace of bal. A limpid har- 
mony. 

He broke camp and set out for 
home. 

T he rest was a movement in re- 
verse. A long journey through 
the wilderness. A descent into the 
underworld. A train ride in a 
tunnel shaped like a slack hose. 

He called Billy by visiphone. A 
recorded voice told him she was no 
longer listed at that code. 



He splurged on a cab ride to the 
space port. 

El-tuna received him. He hopped 
about on the lunar surface for a 
day. Then the TC Liner Bel fort unit 
carried him over fifty parsecs from 
Earthmoon to Vizillo. 

At the space port a delegation of 
the t’oritshka waited to receive him, 
all elders, mostly of his own age. 
His father and uncles were among 
them. His mother, sisters, and Ma- 
rushka were there, but they stood 
back, away from the men. 

He looked at the elders and saw 
anxious expectation on their faces. 
He ran toward them, a red bag over 
his shoulder with the words Time 
Collapse Intragalactica stenciled on 
it in white. He embraced them and 
shook hands and greeted them. 
One of the men said: 

“Grom, brother. So good to have 
you back. But tell us, what did you 
think of . earth? The big world? 
What was it like?’’ 

Grom examined his questioner 
and sensed worry in the man’s 
voice. He realized then that he too 
must act like an elder and say the 
traditional words, the words that 
hid so much agonizing experience 
under a blessing. 

“Splendid,” he said. “Splendid 
freedom. Oh, earth is magnificent. 
The land, the mountains, the 
prairies. It’s the beginning, Tush- 
ka, and it’s the end.” 

The elders beamed. Grom broke 
through them and ran to Ma- 
rushka. +

NATURE’S 

CHILDREN 



—or, as ye reap, 
so shall ye sow! 



Doris Piserchia 



alphonse Durham didn’t turn in- 
JnL to a pig overnight. The trans- 
formation came about gradually. 
Tall, portly and easy-going, he 
sometimes worked hard at his job 
in the lumber mill five miles down 
the road from his small farm. For 
some unknown reason, he started 
to shrink a bit in stature. He put on 
a great deal of weight, made it a 
practice to snap at his family and 
began demanding breakfast in bed 
when he ought to have been out 
punching a time-clock. 

Everyone in the family, especially 
Lovina, his wife, wondered out loud 
if Alphonse was becoming a lazy 
hog. Part of the truth was that he 
was afraid to get out of bed and go 
to work. He wasn’t sure he recog- 
nized anybody at the lumber mill 
now. Within a period of a few 
weeks all his friends there had be- 
come strangers. They didn’t behave 
the same nor did they even look the 
same. Alphonse suspected that they 
were no longer quite human. In- 
stead of talking they grunted, and 
instead of eating their bag-lunches 
in a civilized manner they dumped 
the food in the sawdust, made an 
outer circle with their fat rears and 



had a communal-type repast. 

It didn’t make sense and Al- 
phonse was doubly perplexed when 
no one in the household mentioned 
that the town was occupied by a lot 
of funny people who walked around 
on all fours. This might have been 
accounted for by the fact that his 
family seldom went into town. Al- 
phonse stayed in bed, worried, ate 
ravenously, snapped at his wife and 
children and generally endured his 
existence. 

Now that he had so much leisure 
time, he could see how the farm 
had gone to pot. Lovina obviously 
wasn’t carrying her share of the 
load. The house looked like a pig- 
sty, the fence around the property 
needed repairs, the animals weren’t 
being fed on time, the crops were 
ready for harvesting while autumn 
storms threatened — the damned 
place was going to the dogs. 

“Oink, oink,’’ said Alphonse. 

Take himself, for instance: He 
was being neglected. Lovina had it 
in her to be an excellent cook, but 
she was feeding him slop. At 
dinnertime he lay in his bed (which 
was getting smaller by the day) and 
agonized over the odors drifting in 



34 




from the kitchen. Every evening he 
waited in anticipation for his share 
of the farm booty, and just as faith- 
fully Lovina bore in a scrub bucket 
filled to the brim with potato and 
carrot parings, corn cobs, chunks 
of fat meat, wormy apples and dish- 
water. 

“I want some decent food!” he 
finally bellowed, whereupon Lovina 
brought him a mirror and invited 
him to look at himself. 

‘‘I don’t care what I look like, I 
want to eat like a man!” he yelled. 

She brought him man food and 
he found it impossible. The beef- 
steak felt like rocks in his mouth 
and tasted rotten, the gravy smelled 
to high heaven, the ice cream hurt 
his teeth. He couldn’t eat any of it. 

“Give me back my slop,” he 
said, and got it, and enjoyed it. 

Eventually he grew so fat he had 
(rouble turning over in bed. When 
(he springs broke and the mattress 
landed on the floor he didn’t bother 
trying to fix them, just slept the way 
he was and found it comfortable. 
He discovered that looking in a 
mirror was an interesting way to 
spend his time. Once in a while he 
tried to shave but the bristles on his 
jowls were too tough and ruined his 
razor. He ran out of toothbrushes 
because he couldn’t resist eating 
them when they were laden with 
sweet toothpaste. Only rarely did it 
occur to him that he was getting 
sloppy and disgusting, and then he 
would lie and stare at the wall and 
wonder what was happening to 



him. In the meantime he was 
plagued with a terrible desire: He 
wanted to join the pigs in the pen in 
back of the house. 

The sanitation problem in his 
room grew so bad that his children 
no longer came in to say hello or 
goodnight or to borrow money. Al- 
phonse didn’t mind. His esthetic 
tastes were altering along with his 
body, and, much as he hated to ad- 
mit it, he liked what pigs liked. 

O ne day he broke through a wall 
of his bedroom and joined the 
pigs in the pen. They all rushed 
over to inspect him. A huge black 
and white sow named Gertrude 
leaped astraddle him and bit his 
neck. A small gray boar who had 
been trying to immobilize the sow 
against the fence knocked her off 
Alphonse and attacked him. Bigger 
than all of them, Alphonse beat the 
boar into a whimpering hulk after 
which he located Gertrude who was 
hiding beneath the feed trough. He 
made her come out and then he 
took a good look at her. He knew 
what he wanted to do but he wasn’t 
enough of a pig to go ahead. 
Rutting wasn’t the only thing in the 
world, surely, even for a pig, and 
besides this was the most revolting 
female he had ever seen in his life. 
As he turned away from her, he was 
confident that nothing in the uni- 
verse could make him mount that 
creature. Five minutes later he did. 
He couldn’t help himself. There 
were eight sows and five boars in 



35 




the pen. He beat up five and 
mounted eight. 

He found the psychology of pigs 
easy to understand. Being uncouth 
and spiteful was practically the only 
way they could find diversion. A 
sow might be lying on a dry piece of 
ground, basking in the sun and 
minding her own business, when a 
boar came along and rolled her in 
the muck. Later, as the boar was 
having a snack at the trough, she 
might very likely climb into it and 
crap it up. Invariably he waited un- 
til she decided to try a little sun- 
bathing again at which time he 
promptly rolled her in the muck. 

Alphonse had gotten into the pen 
by crawling under the fence. He got 
out the same way at nightfall, went 
back through the broken wall of the 
house and slept on his fallen 
mattress. 

In the morning Lovina brought 
him his breakfast. “Where were 
you yesterday? I couldn’t find you 
anyw'here.” 

Alphonse merely said, “Oink, 
oink.” 

He ran into a problem later in 
the day when he went to join the 
pigs in the pen. Overnight he must 
have gained a few more pounds and 
now he was too fat to crawl under 
the fence. He solved his dilemma by 
hunting until he found a weak 
place, crashed through and was 
safe inside with Gertrude and the 
rest of his friends. A while later 
Lovina came out, saw the pigs 
running around loose, chased them 



back into the pen with the help of 
Spark, the dog, and then she ran 
barbed wire along the broken areas. 
Alphonse couldn’t get out to go 
back to his room. 

The next morning Lovina came 
out to the pen and stood for the 
longest time, staring in at the pigs. 

“No one would blame me if I said 
I didn’t know which was you,” she 
said. 

“Don’t play games,” said Al- 
phonse. 

“If there’s any man left in you, 
you’d better talk. You think I 
didn’t see what you did yesterday? 
You should be ashamed.” 

“Come on, be a sport and let me 
out of this sty. I’ve had enough for 
today.” 

Lovina rested her elbow on the 
top of the fence, supported her chin 
in her hand and stared at the huge 
white boar who stood in the muck 
and stared back at her through ugly 
little eyes. 

“You can’t talk, can you?” she 
said. “All you can do is grunt. Hell, 
that’s all you ever did anyway.” 
With Spark close beside her to keep 
the boars away, she let herself into 
the pen, walked to the big white 
pig, grabbed his ear and led him 
outside. 

After he had gotten comfortable 
on his mattress, Alphonse said, 
“I’m sorry, I really am. It’s the first 
time I’ve been unfaithful to you.” 

“Oink, oink, that’s all I hear,” 
said Lovina. Starched white apron, 
starched red shirt, jeans, dark hair

in a tight bun, dark eyes flashing 
warning signals from the smoulder- 
ing mind behind them, she stayed 
by the door as if loathe to come 
near the snorting wheezing animal 
whose rump made a dent in the 
wall while its hoofs pointed 
straight at her. 

“You’re a pig,” she said. “Nod 
your head if you understand me. 
Good. I was sure you could. The 
other pigs understand English; the 
ones who used to be human. It’s 
happening all over the world, even 
to most of the older children. Latest 
estimates say about one percent of 
grown males haven’t changed.” 
“Oink, oink,” Alphonse said 
wearily. He was interested in what 
she said but he was tired, hungry, 
disgusted, despairing, and — he was 
exultant when he thought of other 
happy days in the pen. He liked 
being a pig more than he had liked 
being a man. But such a thought 
was dangerous. 

“Help me, Lovina, I’m failing 
last,” he said. 

“Everything is going to hell. The 
world might stabilize eventually, 
since lot of women can do their 
men’s jobs. And maybe it only ap- 
pears that everything is in an up- 
roar. There’s a possibility all this is 
an hallucination. Most of the ex- 
perts say so.” 

“Oink, oink, they’re wrong.” 
“Don’t shake your head. What 
can a pig know?” 

“Pigs are intelligent.” 

“Try to stay in your room,” she

said. "Don’t go back out there.” 
"Is that all you can do to help 
me? Just talk? What if I told you 
this thing with Gertrude is getting 
out of hand? For God's sake, I 
think I’m falling for her.” 

Lovina couldn’t understand him. 
As soon as she left, Alphonse went 
out to the pen. Lifting the bar of 
the gate with his snout, he let him- 
self inside, hit the gate with his rear 
so that it slammed shut and made 
the bar fall. So relieved was he to be 
free of the stuffy house that he de- 
cided not to fight with the boars, 
even had kind words for them. 
They had been born to be slaught- 
ered , they were harmless and not at 
all bad-natured; they were friend- 
lier to him than people had ever 
been and they weren’t critical bas- 
tards who strove for success by 
climbing across bodies. 

"You make me sick,” said Lo- 
vina, when she came out and found 
him there. “I try to be objective but 
it doesn’t work. I don’t know what 
my reaction will be when Gertrude 
has her litter.” 

S he kept him posted on what was 
happening outside his small, 
carnal universe. Approximately one 
percent of mature human males 
were not pigs. They couldn’t do 
much to assauge the world’s pain 
because they weren’t leader-types. 
To a man, their personalities for- 
bade the public limelight. They 
couldn’t even be relied upon to 
attend important meetings. They 



were maddeningly independent 
and, though willing to help the 
women in any way possible, they 
mostly stood around and confessed 
they didn’t know what the hell to 
do. 

Big business had failed; small 
business was stumbling along. 
Each community took care of itself 
and expected others to do the same. 
In big cities the pigs were corralled 
in public squares and details of 
women kept them fed and watered 
while other details took charge of 
supermarkets and rationed out 
food. A mass exodus west before 
the snows came was planned. The 
pigs would be the first to go, in 
trains and trucks. Large details of 
women would accompany them, 
settle them down on abandoned 
farms. Later the other women 
would join them and everyone 
would try to survive and establish 
some kind of workable society. 

The problem of food was always 
present in every group. In open 
country it wasn’t too serious. Most 
human pigs were identifiable by 
tags pinned to their ears. A person 
or group desperate for food chose 
untagged pigs for slaughtering and 
hoped they weren’t doing away with 
somebody’s relative. Certain people 
said only injured or aged pigs 
should be used for food. Others 
objected and after much discussion 
it was decided that a man was a 
man whether he was old or damag- 
ed, young or whole. Dinner pieces 
were selected at random and only

when the diners were satisfied that 
the victim was a stranger. 

Psychologists were vocal, specu- 
lated publicly and privately: Men 
had turned into pigs because of a 
virus; the transformation was an 
illusion; visitors from outer space 
were responsible; someone had con- 
taminated the world’s water sys- 
tems with a drug that altered 
chromosomes; the situation was a 
psychosomatic phenomenon. End- 
less causes, but no cures were 
mentioned. 

Alphonse Durham changed back 
into a man because he decided he 
didn’t want to be a pig. The fall 
days on the farm were perfect, as 
far as the weather was concerned. 
The food trough was always full be- 
cause Lovina was generous and 
conscientious. The pen was warm 
and fragrant, the sows were amo- 
rous and pregnant with Alphonse’s 
children. But he missed his human 
children, his four daughters, his 
disappointments; he had always 
wanted at least one son. But he 
missed his daughters who had run 
away from home weeks before. 
Lovina missed them too. They were 
big girls and able to take care of 
themselves but they were hers and 
every day she told Alphonse how 
much she wanted them back. 

The transformation of pig into 
man began when he realized how 
unnecessary his complex mind was 
becoming. What pig needed so 
much intelligence? The murdering 
knife was the man-made destiny of 



swine, the sun and the trough and 
mucking were their pleasures, and 
they had no use for much of any- 
thing else. 

Once he started thinking about 
Lovina, he couldn’t get her out of 
his mind. Had he been human and 
carried on an adulterous affair, he 
surely would have done it in secret. 
Here he was, mucking around with 
eight holey swine while his wife 
worked hard to keep him alive. 
When she had been compelled to 
slaughter one of the animals for 
food, she hadn’t taken Gertrude, 
nor had she chosen any of the sows. 
Instead she took the gray boar Al- 
phonse disliked. 

As for Gertrude, she had no 
couth, was ready to roll or eat or 
sunbathe with the same enthu- 
siasm. She didn’t care if she were 
doing one or the other or all three 
simultaneously. Stupendous feats 
were within her capacity, but 
mostly because she was all gut and 
no brains. 

Alphonse didn’t think he had 
lost any of his reasoning power. 
Probably he had but it didn’t seem 
to matter. He could still figure 
things out. A pig wasn’t a human in 
any way, shape or form. Living in a 
pen was boring. Satisfying the 
appetite got monotonous after a 
while and there had to be virtue in 
cleanliness and order, no matter 
how alluring filth and slovenliness 
appeared. Pigs simply didn’t do 
anything important. 

“What are you doing in here?” 



NATURE’S CHILDREN

said Lovina, walking into the bed- 
room that evening. It had been 
clean when Alphonse came in ear- 
lier but now it wasn’t. 

T he repaired bed had been 
broken again. 

“Oink, help.” 

“You spoke!” she cried. 

“Oink, ugh, my God, oink, oink, 
1 wish I could die.” 

Total reversion from pig to man 
took place within a few days, a 
much more rapid change than the 
original which had been slow and 
insidious. 

Men began popping up all over 
the world, not a great many but 
enough to convince women that the 
male of the species was again going 
to be significant. Radio stations 
and TV programs recounted the 
stories of the reborn. They were 
horror stories. Nervous, shivering 
males told the world it was hell to 
be a pig. They described how 
desperately they clung to the 
memory that they had once been 
human, that when the final vestiges 
of humanness began to disappear 
in their thoughts, they rebelled. 
What kind of revolt was it? Oddly 
enough it started in the viscera, a 
nauseous sensation that progressed 
to a complete rejection of their en- 
vironment. Thoughts of the sun, 
the filth and their companions 
made them sick. They had found- 
ered on satisfaction. Conscience, or 
reason, clamored. They were what 
they were, no matter how they 



looked, and when facade threat- 
ened to supercede reality an inner 
defense mechanism punctured the 
fog and the desire to return to man- 
hood was activated. 

Alphonse was a man. “I’m never 
going to be a pig again,” he said to 
Lovina. “If you can forgive me I’ll 
do everything I can to make you 
happy.” 

“I never knew one person could 
make another happy. It sounds like 
a lot of output on one side and in- 
take on the other.” 

“Do you forgive me?” 

“I don’t know, but it probably 
doesn't matter. If you weren’t 
special I never would have married 
you. Now that you’re human again, 
I realize how much 1 missed you. 
You’re a handsome man, Alphonse, 
and you’re fairly well built. I like 
the way you walk, and there are 
other things.” 

“But those things aren’t the rea- 
son you’re glad I’m back.” 

“The main reason is sex appeal, 
whatever that is.” 

Whatever it was, the second 
honeymoon didn't last long. Al- 
phonse made himself into a rug and 
Lovina walked on him, reluctantly 
at first and then contemptuously 
and then brazenly. The mill wasn’t 
operating so he took over the farm- 
work — all of it. And all of the 
housework. He did everything; he 
even served Lovina her meals in 
bed. 

“You’re going too far,” she said. 
“I’ll never be a pig again.”

“There’s a variety of animals on 
this planet.” 

Gertrude was traded to a farmer 
in the next town for a black boar 
named Max. The seven remaining 
sows were also traded for strangers. 
Alphonse felt better about slopping 
the pigs after that. 

Every day he sprinkled Lovina’s 
body with oil and gave her a thor- 
ough massage. She did no work 
that might have strained her in any 
way, but he didn’t take that into 
consideration. He was a changed 
man. 

“You’re a very equal person,” he 
said, patting her fanny. “In fact, 
you’re so equal I’m actually in- 
ferior.” 

“You’re beginning to make me 
uneasy. Can’t you just be plain old 
Alphonse and stop worrying about 
pigs?” 

Shuddering, he stroked her back. 
“This thing isn't over yet. I want us 
to survive. I think we really and 
truly love each other and something 
tells me that’s important.” 

“You’re sounding more like a 
simpleton every day. Don’t rub so 
hard and use a little less oil.” 

“Civilization has about had it. 
We might all cash in our chips if 
more men don’t come back. Two 
hundred million, scattered over the 
world, aren’t enough to repopulate, 
let alone help rebuild.” 

“Sounds like a lot to me,” said 
Lovina. 

“Not when a big percentage of 
them are young boys. The others

have got to come back. Women 
need men.” 

“And vice versa.” 

He bent and kissed her neck. 
‘‘Go away now so I can have a 
nap,” she said. “Don’t forget to 
take care of the hay, cotton, 
chickens, pigs, goats, and milk the 
cows, feed the cats and dogs, make 
the butter and ice cream, and for 
God’s sake clean the house a little, 
won’t you?” 

W hen he brought in her dinner 
tray one evening, she inspect- 
ed the food with a scowl. “Don’t we 
have any potato parings?” 

Nearly dropping the tray, he 
stared at her in astonishment. “Say 
that again.” 

“This stuff gives me indigestion. 
Why can’t you fix anything decent? 
1 have a craving for peelings and 
corncobs and maybe some chunks 
of fat meat and some wormy apples 
all mixed in dishwater.” 

The first thing Alphonse did was 
to hurry into town and try to find a 
doctor. He needed help. Someone 
had to come out to the house and 
stop Lovina from becoming some- 
thing else. 

The doctor was in her office, but 
she was a pig. The ticket-taker at 
the seedy theater on the corner was 
also a pig. So were the checkout 
clerks in the town’s only store. So 
were a lot of other women. So was 
Lovina, as he discovered when he 
went home. 

“Oink, oink, help!” 



“Fight it,” said Alphonse. “Do 
something before it takes hold.” 

“You did it. It’s your fault. 
Oink, oink, oink!” 

“There’s no one to help me. All 
the women are turning into pigs 
and there are about two hundred 
men in the whole damned state! 
Christ, there won’t be anybody 
left!” 

He was almost right. About one 
percent of mature women remained 
human while approximately twenty 
percent of the human male pigs 
had reverted, so about twenty one 
percent of the formerly-human 
population were now walking 
around on two legs. Even faster 
than before, the world skidded 
down the slide toward another 
Stone Age. 

It didn’t take Lovina long to 
leave the bedroom and make her 
initial pilgrimage to the pigpen. Al- 
phonse did what he could to 
prevent it; the outsides of the bed- 
room walls were latticed with two- 
by- fours. He regretted his lack of 
imagination when she exited the 
house via the hall, taking several 
doorframes with her. She might 
have earned a record for being the 
fattest pig in the world. Alphonse 
was six feet tall and weighed two 
hundred pounds. Lovina used to be 
five-ten and had weighed one-sixty. 
As a pig Alphonse had tipped the 
scales at nine hundred. Lovina was 
every bit of eleven hundred pounds, 
the biggest, whitest hog Alphonse 
had ever seen.

He stayed by the fence and stood 
guard. Whenever the boars tried to 
approach his wife he fired his rifle 
into the ground in front of them. 
This procedure consumed most of 
the afternoon and he was forced to 
think of the coming night. Would 
l.ovina return to the house or stay 
here? Finally he lassoed her around 
the neck with a thick rope and tried 
to haul her through the gate. She 
backed up and pulled him into a 
mud puddle. 

Max, the black beast Alphonse 
had acquired from the farmer down 
the road, immediately mounted 
Lovina. The five other boars got in 
line behind him. As Alphonse 
staggered toward the rifle, Max 
abandoned his amorous position 
and charged, reached the rifle first, 
grabbed the stalk between his teeth 
and broke it. Giving Alphonse a 
glare from his ugly little eyes, the 
big boar returned to Lovina and 
proceeded to beat back his com- 
petitors. Max was no pig. He was a 
man who looked like a pig. A black 
man. 

It wouldn’t have mattered if Max 
had been white. The fact that he 
was a man-pig was what enraged 
Alphonse. Plus the fact that Lovina 
was so enthusiastic about being had 
by everything in the pen. 

Alphonse got a club and started 
beating heads. Most of the pigs ran 
through the open gate and headed 
across the open fields. Lovina and 
Max stayed inside, coupling. Al- 
phonse went after them. Before he 



reached them, he turned into a pig. 
His rage had blown his mind. He 
was all emotion now and wasn’t 
aware of his transformation as he 
leaped through the air and sank his 
tusks into Max’s shoulder. 

The black boar screamed and fell 
onto his back. Alphonse tried to 
gore him in the stomach. Max took 
one look at the size of his opponent, 
leaped to his feet and sped out of 
the pen. 

Alphonse gored Lovina’s thigh, 
tried to knock her down, bit her, 
shrieked in pain when she took his 
large scrotum in her teeth. Aban- 
doning that vulnerable spot, she 
raked her teeth across his chest, left 
bloody furrows. 

They battled in earnest, jowl to 
jowl, eyes engorged and furious, 
their grunts and growls not mere 
threats but savage promises. He 
tried to down her but she downed 
him. She attempted to break his leg 
with her teeth but he escaped by 
goring a deep hole in her side. He 
went in for his kill and she ripped 
away a large chunk of his throat. 
Their blood soaked the ground, 
mixed with the mud, clouded their 
vision, sprayed the air, but they 
didn’t stop fighting. 

He knocked her flat, saw her 
head crash into a crimson pool. She 
ripped at him until he fell beside 
her, his body leaking red from a 
dozen gashes. 

“I’m trying to kill her,” he 
thought dazedly. “My wife. We’re 
trying to kill each other.”

“Alphonse,” she whispered 
weakly. 

He crawled until his nose touch- 
ed hers. He wept and his tears 
mingled with hers. They sobbed be- 
cause of their own wounds and be- 
cause of the wounds they had given 
each other. She licked his throat 
where she had given him a nearly- 
fatal bite, he licked the hole in her 
side. Exhausted, bleeding, they lay 
and tried to comfort one another. 

alphonse felt a consuming desire 
to kiss his wife. He raised his 
snout and found himself staring 
into a human face. Lovina had 
turned back into a person. So had 
he. The damage they had sustained 
was still with them. Both were weak 
and bleeding and torn. 

Neither of them could walk. 
They crawled to the house, closed 
the front door, lay for hours on the 
living room floor until they re- 
gained enough strength to tend to 
one another’s wounds. They didn’t 
speak, avoided glances, touched re- 
luctantly and by and by Alphonse 
went into one of the bedrooms and 
Lovina didn’t follow. She went into 
a room of her own. When they shut 
the doors they shut more than just 
two panels of wood. 

Alphonse wasn’t certain as to 
exactly when he turned back into a 
pig. It might have been a week 
later, it might have been longer. 
The first several days were hazy and 
pain-filled for him. He slept a great 
deal and occasionally forced him- 



self to go out to the kitchen for 
food. Lovina stayed out of sight. He 
washed his wounds every day, 
changed the bandages, staggered to 
his bed and slept some more. All 
the while he listened for some 
sound she might have made, but he 
rarely heard anything. Like he, Lo- 
vina was keeping mostly to her 
room. 

And then one day he turned into 
a pig. He wasn’t expecting it. His 
niind had begun to function again 
and he thought more about his own 
situation than he thought of what 
had happened. Eventually he re- 
sented his solitude, his fear and his 
discomfort. It had to be at least 
partly Lovina’s fault. 

A week later he stood on all fours 
in the opening of a cave and stared 
down into the valley where the farm 
sat. There was no movement, the 
house was dark, no smoke came 
from the chimney. He knew Lovina 
couldn’t be down there. She had 
turned into a pig, too, at about the 
same time he did. Both of them ran 
into the hills. She was probably in 
one of the caves on the other side of 
the valley. 

Tears leaked down his face. 
There was no place to go. He had 
already tried the town. A few 
people lived there but he was afraid 
to approach them. As for the pigs 
everywhere, he often saw them but 
they ran away from him and each 
other. No doubt they were all like 
him now, terrified and lonely and 
beginning to suspect that the end of

(he nightmare lay inside them- 
selves. 

Alphonse stared down at the 
farmhouse. Was it possible hu- 
manity was an imaginary figment? 
Where was the proof that there 
really had been such a thing as the 
human race? The people in the 
lown? No, that wasn’t proof. 

“Oink.” He said it, and it scared 
him. 

“Don’t be a fool,” he told him- 
self. “Of course there’s a human 
race. You were once part of it and 
you can be again. All you have to 
do is find your human self.” 

In the middle of the night he be- 
came a man. He had been lying 
with his snout pointed toward his 
home and wishing he had someone 
lo talk to. 

A while later, he turned the door- 
knob and walked into his house. He 
lit a lantern and set it by the front 
window. Wandering from room to 
room was comforting. He touched 
things as he had never touched 
(hem before. The books on the 
shelves in his room were real be- 
cause he understood them. His 
hands enjoyed the feel of paper and 
cloth. The bed felt soft to his thighs 
when he sat on it. He liked the way 
his feet met the floor as he walked. 
The air he breathed was good, food 
w as soft and tasty and revitalizing, 
silence was — no good. 

S he scratched at the door 
about midnight the next eve- 
ning.

“The light. I saw it and knew you 
were here. I don’t know what I’d 
have done if I hadn’t seen it.” 
“You don’t have to whisper,” he 
said. “Come in.” 

She hesitated. “It’s because I’m 
afraid.” 

“So am I. Let’s have dinner to- 
gether.” 

She was naked. Going into her 
room, she shut the door and stayed 
away a long time. When she came 
out, she was dressed. 

“What took you so long?” he 
said. 

“I was looking at everything. It’s 
new and different, isn’t it?” 

“Yes.” 

They had a meal together. Star- 
ing at him over her coffee cup, she 
reached out and laid her hand on 
his. 

“We’re in danger,” she said. “It 
can happen again.” 

“I know.” 

“Why?” 

He shook his head. “That I don’t 
know. I think it’s probably simple. 
We either get along together or 
we’ll be back up in those hills.” 
She shivered. “We’ve been living 
together for thousands of years. 
Scientists say for millions of years. 
We built a civilization together. No 
matter what anybody says, we 
stand or we fall together. There 
can’t be any other way.” 

“You don’t think it’ll be dif- 
ferent some day? Maybe science 
will fix it so women won’t have 
babies any more. Maybe men and 



women will be exactly the same.” 

“No,” she said. “We’re two of a 
kind but we’ll always be different. 
Why does that have to mean we’ll 
tight?" 

“That’s too hard for me to 
answer.” 

He knew he would have to 
answer it some day. He knew it 
then and he knew it a month later 
when he stood on all fours in the 
cave opening and stared down at 
the house. The lantern in the front 
window was lit. Lovina was down 
there, telling him to come home. 

How long would this go on? 
Would they keep changing into 
pigs? They met, ate together, even 
made love, talked, talked, talked, 
and it was the damned talk that 
kept making pigs of them. Because 
they couldn’t speak without think- 
ing. So it was the mind that had to 
grow up. 

It didn't just happen when he 
was with Lovina. He had met a man 
and their conversation changed 
them both into grunting swine who 
ran away from each other. Just a 
brief talk with a man. How to 
think, how to bring the human to 
top level, how to be master of one’s 
own soul — a condition to live for. 
Do it or die squealing that the 
world was a puddle of muck. 

H e stared down at the bright 
window and he wept. “We’ll 
do it!” he cried. “We have to do it 
right, Lovina. If we don’t, we’re 
finished.” *

U ntil he heard the leopard 
cough there had been only the 
pain of his broken arm, firmly 
pinned by the crotch of the drift- 
wood that had sheltered and carried 
him across a hundred miles of veldt 
before the flash flood had sunk 
enough to let it ground. Now, there 
was pain and panic. He moaned in 
I error, flailing at the branches, 
starting a fresh flow of blood from 
the torn flesh. Either the blood 
helped, lubricating the skin and 
bark, or he had grown more des- 
perate. His arm slipped, still 
trapped, but turning in the taper of 
(he fork. 

The terror still lay upon him, but 
the panic had ebbed. He turned 
farther, whimpering as much in 
fear as from the agony in his 
Crumpled arm. Finally, by twisting 
as much as possible, he could just 
Hip a foot against the far bough of 
(he trap — then he could walk up 
until his back was to the main 
trunk, and both legs were bent 
double overhead, feet pressed 
against the pinning branches. It 
look almost his full height before 
he could overcome the spring of the 
wood, force loose the wooden jaws; 
then he was free, falling back 
against the trunk. 

He lay for a moment before 
rolling over in the direction from 
which the sound had come. A quar- 
ter of a mile away, the cat was mov- 
ing, silhouetted against the gold- 
washed evening sky. It was heading 
away from him, moving in an easy 



lope along the far bank of the wide 
arroyo. 

The light breeze carried the 
faint, musky stench of the cat to 
him. It had neither seen nor scent- 
ed him — but he knew that if the 
wind changed, the blood-odor 
would bring it back. Worse, it was 
almost dark — things other than 
leopards hunted the haunted night. 
He could not stay in the tree, and 
there was nowhere else to go. The 
limestone caves where the hunting 
packs bedded safe in their numbers 
were a hundred miles distant — even 
farther than the spot where he had 
gained the trees scant yards ahead 
of the cloudburst-fed wall of water 
that had come snarling down the 
ravine. 

But he could not stay in the tree; 
he dropped onto the gravel of the 
streambed, stood trembling for a 
moment, shaken by the drop. 

I n three million years his chil- 
dren would be men. He foreshad- 
owed those years so well that his de- 
cendants would argue whether he 
should be named Australopithecus 
hahilis, the last of the not-quite- 
men — or Homo habilis, the first of 
the true men. He stood upright, 
nearly hairless, and below the 
heavy eyebrows, the face was star- 
tlingly human. 

The effect was strongest in his 
dark eyes, alive now with fear and 
pain, flickering over the rocky waf.s 
as they sought shelter or weapon.

The too-heavy chin, the abrupt 
curve of the forehead, were muted 
by the heavy shock of hair and 
beard, while the thick black curls 
on limbs and torso accented the 
brown skin without covering it. 

He had no name— it was still too 
early for individual designations. 
Not quite Adam — that honor went 
to others, earlier — but Adam’s 
firstborn. Let us call him Cain — as 
good a name as any. 

Cain, then, stood in the bed of 
the wash. The thirsty sun and 
greedy sands had sucked away the 
Hood, but a few pools remained, 
and he knelt to drink, cupping the 
water in his good hand as he 
watched for the leopard. The wash 
was paved with stream rounded 
pebbles, mixed with jagged chunks 
pounded from larger stones, and he 
chose one with a fairly sharp edge. 
Should the leopard — or worse, a 
lion or hyena pack — appear, it 
would be a feeble weapon. But 
better than none. 

He was climbing the bank when 
he saw the bone. Longer than his 
forearm, ending in a heavy double 
joint, the half-buried leg joint was a 
weapon — the weapon of his kind. 
He lusted for it, and clambered 
over the shifting sand to pull it free. 
He was swinging it, testing the feel, 
when the hunting cat returned. 

Cain screamed in terror as it 
snarled and leapt, the bank adding 
momentum to its flight. Rolling 
away from the slashing claws, he 
flailed wildly with the bone club, 



then there was a tearing at his 
back — not the smashing blow he 
expected, but a futile grasp for 
footing, and the bone was gone, 
wrenched from his hand. From the 
bottom of the bank came choking 
roars, as terrifying as if the cat were 
still upon him, and he lay, his face 
pressed earthward, until the sounds 
died and he could nerve himself to 
look. 

Not quite yet a leopard — larger, 
fiercer — the cat lay sprawled at the 
bottom of the arroyo, the first 
rigors of death touching paws that 
still clawed at the bone club 
jammed down its throat with the 
full force of the spring. Scrambling 
down, Cain cautiously bounced a 
pebble off the spotted hide, then 
another, before gaining the courage 
to approach the carcass. He would 
have fled, but the lure of the club 
was too great. 

I t was slow work to free the club, 
and it was almost dark when he 
succeeded. He had to find shelter. 
He was too sick to travel far but the 
club was at least psychological sup- 
port. His homing instinct turned 
him back up the wash. The leopard 
had made enough noise to draw any 
predators within miles, and he was 
alert for any sign that the cat’s 
death howls had brought a lion or a 
second leopard. He was not pre- 
pared for what came instead. 

He did not see the line of heads 
until it had grown to a row of up-

right, five foot forms, shadowed 
against the fading golds and glow- 
ing purples of the sky, atop the 
bank. There was time to run a 
dozen paces, then a well thrown 
rock caught him behind one ear, 
sending him crashing, face down, 
into an almost dry puddle. Con- 
sciousness remained only long 
enough for him to sense the ap- 
proach of the line down the slope 
toward him. 

He woke with the panic still upon 
him, too weak from loss of blood to 
do more than whimper and toss 
feebly. It was day, but the light was 
shattered into a dance of shadows, 
and he slowly realized that he lay 
beneath a large thorn bush, the 
light flickering as the canopy of 
leaves fluttered in a gentle breeze. 
The blood had been licked from his 
torn arm, and he had been placed 
in a hollow scooped from the sand 
and lined with coarse grasses and 
leaves. 

The panic passed slowly, to be 
replaced by fever, pain, and an 
ever-growing thirst. As the morning 
passed into the heat of afternoon 
his fever deepened. He could smell 
water nearby, but he w'as too ill to 
attempt finding it. 

The female came at evening, 
bending over him to spit a sip of 
lukew arm water into his dry mouth. 
He almost gagged on the sudden 
gush of liquid, then managed to 
swallow. She waited patiently to 
finish passing the mouthful of 
water, then left. Weakened beyond 



fear, Cain could only whimper after 
her. She returned with a second 
mouthful, cooler than the first, and 
an over-ripe fruit. He took the 
water, but pushed the fruit away. 
She grunted, ate it, then withdrew, 
leaving him to lapse back into a 
fevered sleep. 

The fever worried at him for 
three days, trying to tug away the 
slender thread of life, then slunk 
off, defeated, to leave him to two 
days of healing sleep. The female 
came two or three times a day, lick- 
ing his wounds, or picking out the 
maggots after the flies found him. 
It was not mercy — the maggots 
w'ere promptly eaten with great 
relish — but it aided his healing. 
The rest of the time he slept, wak- 
ing only to accept water. The 
broken arm was mending. If he 
lived until it healed, it would be 
crooked, but useable. 

On the sixth day, he had recov- 
ered enough to become aware of his 
surroundings. The thorn bush 
reached the ground about him, 
hollowed in the center, with a single 
opening kept stoppered with a ball 
of dead branches. It had enough 
worth as a shelter to permit a fright- 
frozen Cain to lie and peer through 
the leaves as a lioness prowled 
through the clump of bushes, un- 
able to do more than snuffle and 
growl in frustration. 

His hosts — or captors — were al- 
most as human as he. Any of the 
several children or younger females 
would have passed easily enough in

the caves — although their faces 
were flatter, with longer jaws and 
more sharply canted foreheads. But 
the two males he had seen were 
giants — a foot taller than Cain, 
who was tall for a hunter — and the 
muscles of their unbearded jaws 
were so heavy they formed visible 
ridges as they worked at chewing 
the heavy roots and tubers that 
were the staples of their diet. There 
were no signs of serious hunting, or 
even of meat eating — a good sign, 
though he could not interpret it. It 
made it less likely that he was to be 
eaten. 

S eventeen million years before, 
the Miocene jungles had 
stretched to Lake Victoria in a 
chain of swamps interspersed with 
open savannahs and forested park- 
lands. Here, long before Adam, 
other, earlier ancestors had brows- 
ed the shores and forests of Eden, 
or waded into the swamps after 
worms and shellfish. Somehow, one 
had changed. Perhaps moving into 
deeper waters forced him upright, 
hair that could catch clogging mud 
falling away, hands to capture slip- 
pery mollusks developing. 

Later, when the fiery sword of 
the Pliocene had dried the lands, 
sending those early hominidae forth 
from Eden to labor in the sweat of 
their brows, there had been a 
second change. Lost in a past so 
distant as to be beyond comprehen- 
sion, a beast had bent to pick up a 
stone. 



A beast had bent. Adam arose. 

And Adam had two sons: Cain, 
the first born — a hunter of the 
beasts of the field. And Abel. 

He came on the eighth day, fol- 
lowing the female into the ring of 
thorns to squat in silence while she 
licked Cain’s wounds clean and 
gave him a small, sour fruit. Larger 
and heavier than Cain, Abel shared 
the same bright gift of intelligence. 
He, too, carried a weapon — a fist- 
sized chunk of rock, roughly hack- 
ed to a point, and loosely carried in 
one massive hand. When the fe- 
male finished Abel rose to a crouch 
and began to prod and pull Cain 
toward the entrance. Resisting at 
first, then slowly crawling on one 
hand, the smaller man followed the 
female down the short tunnel while 
Abel brought up the rear. 

Once they were both in the open 
the giant helped the hunter to 
stand. Cain swayed for a moment, 
sick and dizzy, half blinded by the 
unfiltered sunlight. Abel waited for 
him to recover, then urged him for- 
ward between two bushes into an 
open stretch of gravel-strewn sand, 
in the center of which was a small, 
spring-fed water hole surrounded 
by plants. Kneeling, Cain drank, 
eyeing the other cautiously as he 
did so. Abel merely stood by, silent- 
ly watching. The female was gone. 

Reassured, Cain studied his sur- 
roundings. Two of the bushes 
facing the spring were hollowed, 
but empty. Farther down the small 
stream that ran from the spring to 



52 



GALAXY 




vanish in the sand, a group of fe- 
males and children were grubbing 
at the vegetation that lined the 
banks. He could not count them — 
his concept of number stopped at 
three — but they were not many. 
There was no sign of the second 
male he had seen earlier, nor of the 
female, who had tended him. 

When he had drunk enough, he 
stood, and Abel approached, push- 
ing him back toward the bush. The 
larger man did not follow him with- 
in the ring, but closed the entrance 
from without, leaving Cain in soli- 
tude. There were several roots on 
the ground beside the sleeping nest 
— coarser stuff than he had been 
given before, and he put them 
aside. A quick circle of the bush 
brought a low mewl of pleasure as 
he found the bone club where it had 
been carelessly discarded. The feel 
of the heavy bone restored his con- 
fidence and spirits as he squatted 
beside the hollowed nest, scouring 
the weapon with a handful of sand. 

He did not wait for Abel or the 
female to appear the next morning, 
but pushed the plug aside himself 
and crawled into the open, drag- 
ging the club behind him in his 
rapidly mending left hand. Moving 
behind a bush, he scraped a hole in 
the sand and relieved himself, then 
walked down to the water hole to 
drink. He was bent at the edge of 
the spring when Abel and the sec- 
ond male emerged from the shelter 
nearest the clearing, hand-stones 
grasped easily in their fists. 



Shifting the club to his right 
hand, Cain tensed, but there was 
no sign of hostility from the giants, 
nor any sign that they found his 
presence disturbing. They reached 
the water a few feet away, one 
drinking while the other stood, 
then changed places. When Abel 
rose, Cain rose also, falling in be- 
side his brother, but leaving a re- 
spectful ten feet between them. 
Abel continued to ignore him, and 
the other male watched for a 
moment, then lost interest and 
walked off. 

They passed through the ring of 
shelters (avoiding the children be- 
ing herded out by the females) and 
into the desert beyond. Although 
shorter, Cain easily matched Abel’s 
waddling stride. Cain’s children 
would one day be men — Abel’s 
never. 



already, Abel had taken a wrong 
/V turning, moving into the bush- 
lands to live on the roots and tubers 
he found there — while Cain had re- 
mained on the open veldt, turning 
hunter to survive. Now the drought 
struck into the heart of the bush- 
lands, drying streams into washes, 
replacing lusher vegetation with the 
hardy thorn bush and cactus. 

Roots and tubers became 
scarcer, tougher to chew. Jaw 
muscles changed to meet new de- 
mands, body chemistry to wrest 
nourishment from lower-grade 
food. The drying-death continued 



INCIDENT 



53 




with calm, steady ferocity as the 
millennia of the Pliocene slowly un- 
wound; the bush had become a 
trap. Abel and his kind were dying. 

Cain did not realize they were 
hunting until they actually flushed 
game — a small rodent that darted 
from cover to scamper across the 
open sand toward its burrow. There 
was a flash of motion as Abel slung 
the stone in a sidearm throw, send- 
ing up a shower of sand a few 
inches ahead of the cony. The ro- 
dent gained its nest and went to 
ground, and Abel grunted and 
went to retrieve his throwing stone. 

When he returned, Cain was 
searching through the groundcover 
beyond the burrow, and the smaller 
man grunted, pulling aside a bush 
to reveal a second entrance. As 
Abel came to watch, Cain rose, 
barking a command that could be 
roughly translated as ‘watch the 
hole’. The giant made a soft sound, 
but did not move. Cain repeated 
the command, then gave it up. He 
lacked the sophistication to realize 
that there might be differences in 
language, but he could tell the other 
did not understand. He changed to 
sign language, patting the ground 
and acting out what the other must 
do. 

Abel watched the performance 
impassively, then his eyes lit and 
flickered to the first hole, and he 
knelt. Returning to the entrance, 
Cain began to pound the ground 
with his club, tracing the windings 
of the hidden burrow. He was half- 

54 



way to Abel when the hyrax emerg- 
ed from the bolt-hole in a flurry of 
motion, and Abel swung his stone. 
He came to his feet, holding the 
bloody rodent, his face a mass of 
ridges and hollows as the heavy 
muscles folded into a grin. Cain 
grinned back, then both men 
chuckled and moved off toward the 
water hole — still separated, but by 
five feet rather than ten. 

A second male was recruited and 
trained, and at day’s end they had 
perfected the technique of clearing 
burrows. The entire colony gath- 
ered an hour before sunset to 
feast — meat enough for even chil- 
dren to taste. For Cain, whose jaws 
were never meant for chewing bulbs 
and roots, it was survival. 

The drought had been no kinder 
to the smaller beasts than to the 
larger. The conies were eaten raw, 
and nothing wasted — but there was 
little meat. Cain would need many 
more to regain his strength — to get 
them, he must greatly improve 
Abel’s hunting skills. 

He could not gather a full hunt- 
ing pack — even including the fe- 
males and children, there were not 
enough of the gentle giants to work 
after the manner of his kind. But 
there were other ways, and he had 
seen signs of easy game around the 
water hole. The problem lay in 
communicating with Abel. 

He began the lessons the follow- 
ing morning, leading them after a 
larger burrower that would some- 
day be an aardvark. The technique 

GALAXY 




was a variant of the one already 
taught, and he was content to lead, 
leaving the killing to the two giant 
males. They returned in triumph 
with their prey, and Cain was 
mildly interested to note that the 
giants skinned out the aardvark 
with the same hand-stones used for 
the kill — a task which he would 
have done with the knife-like lower 
jaw of a small antelope or deer. 

Flushed with the success of the 
hunt, and with the heat of noon 
upon them, Abel demurred from 
any further effort, leaving Cain to 
his own devices. Restless, he wan- 
dered through the camp, exploring. 
The females were again digging 
along the stream, using the hand 
stones — this time as picks. Pointed 
chunks of rock were common 
enough in stream beds — he used 
them himself for simple tasks if 
they were at hand. But these were 
strangely sharp, and he was vaguely 
puzzled to notice that they were all 
of a size and shape. The stones 
added force to a blow, and the 
giants could throw them with fair 
accuracy, but he dismissed them as 
generally inferior to the club as a 
hunting weapon — but the stones 
had other uses. 

H e came upon the female who 
had nursed him working alone 
at a thorn bush. The thorn-ring 
sprang from a central stem, and 
she was using one of the hand- 
stones to hack away the tough 
deadwood clogging the space be- 



neath the arching boughs, slicing 
the stems free and discarding them. 
She stopped as she saw Cain, smil- 
ing shyly. He instinctively recoiled 
as she approached, extending the 
stone to him, but she smiled again 
and repeated the offer. 

Dropping the club, he accepted 
the hand-ax, turning it to examine 
the edge. The picks he had seen 
were hacked to points — this had a 
row of jagged edges, stained now 
with sap. The material was shiny 
where chipped, and cool to his 
grasp — heavy, but not awkward. 

The female made a soft sound, 
her smile widening into a grin, and 
mimicked the action of cutting. 
Tentatively, he swung at the tangle. 
The stone turned in his hand and 
glanced away, leaving the branch 
unmarked. He tried again, harder, 
with the same result, and she 
laughed and took the hand-ax, 
holding it by one edge, and showed 
him how to slice across the branch, 
then handed it back. 

It took a few tries to get the feel 
of the thing, then he was slicing 
with increasing skill at the tough 
wood. The sharpness of the edge 
was startling — the branches parted 
with clean, open cuts, and he soon 
discovered the knack of making 
two cuts meet in a vee. He was 
happily practicing his new art when 
the female placed a hand on his 
arm, indicating that they had clear- 
ed enough. Reluctantly, he handed 
back the ax. 

Looking from his face to the ax, 



INCIDENT 



55 




she giggled, then motioned for him 
to follow. Leading him back 
through the brush to an outcrop- 
ping of rock, she stooped, moving 
her hand over the stones. Selecting 
one at last, she handed it to Cain. 
He turned it as he had the hand-ax. 
There were a few chipped places — 
but nothing to match the edge of 
the ax. Puzzled, he returned the 
fist-sized rock. Her next act added 
to his puzzlement — picking up a 
second stone, she squatted, ham- 
mering the two together. The action 
seemed purposeless, but when she 
again offered the rock, there was a 
row of sharp chips down one side — 
sharper than the edge of the hand- 
ax had been. 

To the credit of his man-bound 
wit, he grasped the idea almost im- 
mediately. The ground was littered 
with similar chunks, and he knelt 
and chose one, bringing it down on 
another without perceptible result. 
He swung again, harder. This time, 
both stones broke and crumbled, 
producing only a few flakes of de- 
composed granite. Giggling again, 
the girl knelt beside him, moving 
her hand over the rocks as she had 
done at first. 

It took much gesturing to make 
Cain apprehend that rough, pitted 
rocks were unsuitable, and teach 
him to choose hard, brittle flints 
from the similarly iron-stained 
granites. When they had found 
several, he tried again. The stone 
fractured into two unequal halves 
on the first swing, without produc- 



ing a sharp edge. The girl shook 
her head negatively, and took one 
of the chunks. This time, he 
watched closely as she hammered 
delicately at the sharp lip, flaking 
off smaller chips. At the end of the 
demonstration, he shrugged and 
rose. The process took two good 
hands. 

He hunted again toward dusk — 
alone, more for the solitude of it 
than for food. He found a lizard, 
and, by luck, another hyrax, and 
the skies were already deepening 
into the purples of twilight before 
he returned to the sleeping-bush. 
He had lived there alone since the 
morning of the first hunt. Now 
there was movement within. He 
dropped the game and grasped his 
club, the sun-warmed bone reas- 
suring to his hand, and slipped 
silently to the entrance, ready to 
fight. Instead, he found the girl, a 
few fruits laid beside her, in a 
second nest adjoining his own. 

She was young — younger than he 
had thought — not yet heavy with 
child, or worn from childbirth. He 
expected some show of resentment 
from the two males, but there was 
none. For Cain’s kind, pairing was 
a matter of life — and death. Only 
the strongest and most jealous kept 
more than one mate. The easy-go- 
ing polygamy of the giants baffled 
him. He put it aside; the woman 
was his — that was enough. 

I n the next two weeks they great- 
ly diminished the easier game in 



56 



GALAXY 




the neighborhood of the water hole. 
The time was one of healing — at its 
end, his left arm was strong enough 
to grasp and carry, and he had 
learned three things; to throw the 
stones, to chip the edge of a flint 
to razor keenness, and to com- 
municate — after a fashion — with 
Abel. 

Abel, in turn, had come to enjoy 
unprecedented plenty. Cain requir- 
ed flesh to survive — Abel regarded 
it as a palatable luxury. He con- 
tinued to eat his usual diet of tubers 
and grew almost sleek — and defi- 
nitely lazy. Now the easy meat was 
nearly gone the time had come to 
hunt larger stuff. 

It took two days of prodding — 
complicated by the lack of a com- 
mon language or background — be- 
fore the easy-going giants grasped 
what he was about — at first with re- 
luctance, then with childlike enthu- 
siasm. 

The game was large — an eland, 
with four-foot horns that could 
slash or impale — but the technique 
was one that had been tested well; 
over a million years of experiment 
had gone into its devising. 

Normally, there would have been 
twenty harriers — the young males 
of the pack — while the rest, fe- 
males, older males, and children, 
waited in the ambush. And the prey 
would have been a herd, not a 
single animal. There were not 
enough of the giants for that. He 
must harry alone. 

The stalk was tediously simple. 



The antelope had little enough rea- 
son to fear the near-men. When 
one of them rose a few yards distant 
and began to shout, it merely 
nodded its massive head in annoy- 
ance and moved away. Exasper- 
ated, Cain came closer. Again, the 
mountain of meat moved daintily 
off. In his anger, he threw the 
hand-stone. By luck the sharp edge 
bit into the shining flank of the 
eland, and it’s head jerked up, eyes 
wide. 

Grasping at success, Cain bent 
and scooped up a stone. The un- 
edged rock hit with enough force to 
bruise, and as Cain screamed in 
imitation of a leopard, the defiance 
in the beast’s eyes changed to fear, 
and it bolted directly away from 
him. He followed, stopping only to 
retrieve the hand-stone, loping 
easily after the eland. It could out- 
run him, but he did not wish to 
catch it. At bay it would be too 
dangerous to face. It was running 
in the right direction, he would 
make sure that it kept running 
until he was too late. 

The eland ignored the bush to 
either side, leaping with flat bounds 
any that stood in its path. A 
movement at one side nearly be- 
trayed the trap, then the terrified 
beast was within the half-ring of 
waiters. Suddenly instead of one 
man-thing running after at a dis- 
tance, it was being mobbed by 
them. Stones whizzed from all 
sides, thudding from lathered 
flanks or skittering noisily off, and 



INCIDENT 



57 




it broke stride and swung about, 
seeking only escape. 

The circle closed inward about it, 
the din increasing. There was still a 
gap, and the antelope ran blindly — 
straight over the edge of the narrow 
ravine concealed in a fold of the 
gently rolling ground. There was 
the rotten-stick snap of breaking 
bone and the eland went down, 
both forelegs shattered. The giants 
gathered on the bank, watching it 
thrash, until Cain arrived, moving 
with the easy grace of the hunter. 

He paused beside Abel, studying 
the situation, then slid down into 
the draw, the bone club in his right 
hand. The eyes of the crippled 
eland were alive with pain and fear, 
and the horns swung toward him, 
threatening disembowelment if 
he should come within reach. Circ- 
ling warily out of range until the 
animal’s head turned, Cain darted 
suddenly, club swinging to crack on 
the antelope’s skull. Too light to 
crush or shatter, it rebounded. He 
danced away as the horns slashed 
at him, then moved in again, bone 
meeting bone. 

To kill, he must strike at the 
neck with enough force to crack the 
vertebrae. There should have been 
a circle, keeping the beast under 
constant attack. For one hunter, it 
was a ticklish job. The second 
male — perhaps thinking Cain too 
feeble to strike a killing blow — end- 
ed the impasse — tragically. 

What passed in the giant’s mind 
was unclear. Without even rudi- 



mentary caution he flung himself 
down the bank, hand-stone raised 
for the coup. His logic was nearly 
correct — the skull which had turn- 
ed the club shattered beneath the 
stone — and the stabbing scimitar of 
horn, driven by the death reflex, 
drilled his shoulder. Only Cain’s 
desperate, last moment shove kept 
it from piercing the lung, and 
killing. The wound was painful and 
disabling, but not crippling. 

There was no question of moving 
the eland to the water hole intact, 
nor of staying in the open where 
predators could find them. The 
carcass was butchered where it lay, 
the women hacking it into bloody 
quarters with their stones, wasting 
nothing. Even the huge head was 
carried back in triumph. For the 
near-men, starvation was a constant 
companion. There was never 
enough to eat, and what the day 
brought was eaten without thought 
of the future — tomorrow must 
bring its own food or one starved. It 
was that simple. 

Now there was food in abund- 
ance — the logical result of applying 
techniques designed to meet the 
minimum needs of a hundred- 
member hunting pack to a twelve- 
member foraging society. Faced 
with more food than they could 
possibly eat at a single sitting, they 
glutted themselves trying. 

That any was saved was due to 
accident. They had carried the 
meat for miles, leaving a broad trail 
of blood to lure other predators. 



58 



GALAXY 




The hyenas came at twilight, skulk- 
ing through the bush, reluctant to 
attack the man-pack. A lion was 
next, ending the feast as the colony 
scattered to shelter, dragging the 
meat with them for one last try at 
gorging it all down. 

Later, in the fitful, uncomfort- 
able sleep of his first experience 
with indigestion, Cain dreamed — 
strange, disquieting dreams of 
pounding futilely at a lion with the 
bone club, of the stone in the 
giant’s hand crashing through the 
eland’s skull, of elands that trans- 
formed into leopards to hunt him. 
He awoke unrested, but with the 
nagging germ of an idea. 

The girl awoke to find him sit- 
ting, the club in his right hand, the 
hand-ax in his left, staring from 
one to the other. With pragmatic 
insight, she left him to his puzzle- 
ment, crawling out to seek water. 
The entire colony was gripped in a 
massive hangover from the feast — 
yet there was still enough food to 
afford them the undreamt luxury of 
a day of rest. 

He continued to nag at the 
puzzle through the morning. Its 
terms were clear enough: the club 
extended the reach, but lacked the 
mass to kill effectively — the hand- 
stone had the weight to kill even 
large game, but required a fool- 
hardy closeness. The stones could 
be thrown, but had no advantage 
over an unedged rock unless the 
cutting edge chanced to strike true. 
Cain could feel the solution near at 



hand, but it eluded him, and he 
gave up at last and went to the 
water to drink. 

Abel and the rest lay sprawled 
about, lazing in the sun. After 
failing in a half-hearted attempt to 
interest the larger man in a short 
hunt, Cain joined him beneath the 
bush, tinkering with the two wea- 
pons again. Abel watched as he 
tapped the ground, first with the 
club, then with the ax, but lost 
interest after a few moments, as the 
girl had. 

The effort was extraordinary. He 
had spent hours upon the problem, 
rather than minutes. The final 
solution took the perseverance of 
genius, and was elegantly simple — 
if the bone was not heavy enough, 
nor sharp enough, place the stone 
at the end of the bone, gaining 
weight and edge, keeping the ad- 
vantage of reach. 

He experimented for two days 
before he managed to wedge the 
hand-ax into the end of the femur 
of the eland. By then the food was 
gone, and they had been forced to 
hunt again. He had taken his new 
weapon, but bone, he quickly dis- 
covered, was brittle. When they 
had trapped the aardvark at last, 
its skull had shattered quite satis- 
factorily. So had the shaft of the 
new ax. Disgusted, he almost gave 
up. 

It was the second male’s wounded 
shoulder that ended the impasse. 
The sight of the raw flesh recalled 
his own torn arm, and he touched 



INCIDENT 



59 




the white scar. The leap was pro- 
digious — for any near-man to recall 
a single incident after nearly two 
months was an incredible feat of 
mind. To equate a forked branch 
that had held his arm so tightly that 
he could not move it with the 
problem at hand was genius of the 
first order. 

It was not lovely. Of necessity, 
the thorn branch was chosen for 
the proper fork, rather than for the 
proper shaft — but it worked. The 
edged stone now ended a three-foot 
club, tightly wedged by the spring 
of two curved twigs that passed 
around and beyond it. Others had 
used what nature provided, im- 
proving at times, but keeping to the 
natural form. This was something 
entirely new — an artifact, an object 
without natural analogue. There 
would be improvements over three 
million years, but no one would 
better the basic idea until the last, 
brief tick of recorded history. 

In his monomania, he bullied the 
giants into another hunt for eland. 
The kill was swift, even though the 
animal had suffered only a broken 
leg, and could still hobble and slash. 
He had continued to experiment, 
slashing one haunch into bloody 
ribbons, until Abel finally object- 
ed — mildly at first, then heatedly. 
If the inventor wished to play with 
sticks and stones, that was his 
business — this was a pragmatic 
matter of wasting good food. 
Smarting and angry, Cain returned 
to the water hole. 



It ended, as it had begun, with 
the girl. She was not in the shelter 
when he returned, and he left the 
ax, took his bone club, and went to 
seek her. Perhaps, had he not been 
angry, he would have understood. 
She had come to him freely. Should 
she tire of him, she could leave as 
freely — it was the way of the giants. 

It was not Cain’s way. The 
hunters mated, if at all, for life — a 
matter of survival, for a nursing 
female could not hunt. But status 
depended upon possession, and 
fights over females were common- 
place. To have, and hold a woman, 
one must be strong — ready to chal- 
lenge any who would take her. The 
stealing of a woman meant battle — 
or shame. When Cain found the 
girl with the second male, there was 
but one interpretation. 

The bewildered giant nearly died 
at the first onslaught. The primitive 
hunting instinct aroused, Cain 
moved in for the kill, swinging the 
bone with wicked force and skill. 
Had one of the hunting folk receiv- 
ed the blow, it would have shatter- 
ed his skull — the giant, protected 
by the heavy ridge of jaw muscles, 
was only stunned. The resistance as 
the club struck triggered Cain’s 
memory, and he turned, sprinting 
for his shelter to retrieve the ax — 
and kill. 

It triggered something else. 
There was no precedent to guide 
him — none of his kind had yet met 
another culture, and survived. Yet 
the shock of experience had taught 



60 



GALAXY 




him to think — the touch of the ax 
reinforced his new habits, bringing 
him to a stop. These were not his 
kind, and a sudden wave of aliena- 
tion and homesickness swept over 
him. He had overstayed his time. 

H e was well enough to travel. 

The coming of the girl, without 
;i bitter fight to claim her, had been 
strange. He would accept her leav- 
ing as another strange, natural 
phenomenon among the giants. 
The first glimmering of under- 
standing was not easy — it warred 
with ingrained patterns — but to his 
credit, instead of returning to the 
light, he left the camp, heading 
toward the foothills — and home. 

There was no need for prepara- 
tion or delay — the ax was the sum 
of his possessions. To carry food 
would only make him tempting to 
predators — he would live on what 
lie found along the way. He had 
covered three miles by dusk, alert 
for the big cats, when he heard 
something moving behind him. 

It was Cain the hunter, instincts 
alert, who slipped to the shelter of a 
boulder to watch the trail. What- 
ever was trailing him made too 
much noise for a cat, and his eyes 
narrowed as he caught a glimpse of 
a massive, upright form against the 
darkling purples of the sky. Bitter- 
ness filled him. He had thought it 
different among the giants. He was 
evidently wrong. 

The end came swiftly. His killing 



instincts flooding back, Cain left 
his ambush, moving silently — 
stalking the other with incompar- 
able skill. The giant did not hear 
Cain come behind him, nor did he 
sense the fall of the ax. The edged 
stone struck his neck, severing 
jugular and carotid arteries, only 
the thick muscles preventing total 
decapitation. Too late, Cain recog- 
nized Abel. 

The larger man stared up at him 
with amazement and disbelief, then 
his eyes clouded with a pain that 
passed into the glaze of death. The 
hand-stone had fallen from one 
fist, but the other remained clench- 
ed, and Cain gently prised it open. 
Perhaps Abel had meant to give a 
parting gift, perhaps he had want- 
ed to tempt Cain back. In the 
hand, like a silent reproach, lay 
three of the small, not quite ripe 
fruits the giants prized so dearly. 

Cain had slain without thought, 
without mercy, without compunc- 
tion. He had done so before. He 
would do so again. Yet, dimly com- 
prehending that the giant had felt 
no malice, he knew this slaying to 
be different. He lacked the words 
or concepts to name guilt or re- 
morse — but he had slain his friend, 
his brother. Murder had been born. 



A moment further he stood, the 
inexpressible sorrow pressing in 
at him, then turned away, to re- 
sume the long, dangerous trek to 
the hills — and manhood.

The war, if you could call it that, 
was three days old. But prepara- 
tions in Washington had been 
ongoing two months. Readiness 
had become imperative when an 
environmental-resources satellite, 
had begun making guesses that a 
large oil field might be overlapping 
defunct U.S. and active Japanese 
oil concessions bordering Abu Dha- 
bi. Confirmation of lower creta- 
cious oil had come quickly, if 
quietly. And shortly afterward cer- 
tain vocal locals had expressed dis- 
satisfaction with their government 
and its policy of all-Japanese oil ex- 
port. Gaining momentum, the 
separatists had laid claim to a fifty- 
kilometer square of desert roughly 
encompassing the newly discovered 
field. 

In a transport of selfless zeal, the 
U.S. had thereupon presented the 
secessionists with limited air-sup- 



port. In the air that support soon 
encountered some dust and smoke 
and a few polite Japanese fighter- 
planes. Not much was happening 
on the ground. 

Cooper’s radarmap told him time 
to IP: nearly eight minutes. He 
could see the circular blips repre- 
senting his double escort, watched 
one slowly move out in front while 
the other dropped back to cover his 
ass. The computer facsimile screen, 
correlating data from the phased 
array radar, started to show targets 
out front — tiny white triangles with 
quadrant identifying codes: RF1, 
RF2, and so on. The horizon line 
split the screen. In the present 
mode, only closing targets were dis- 
played. Cooper took a few deep 
breaths and tried to relax. 

Time to IP: five minutes. 

He busied himself with his 
cameras, watching the status lights 
come up: preheat, lock release, 
cam doors open, exposure to auto. 
Two variable-position wing gun 
cameras relayed stereo video via the 
secure satellite datalink to base in 
Darwin, Australia. Beneath the 
fuselage there was a color 16mm 
movie camera set at 96 fps. Two 
still 35mm cameras shooting at al- 
ternate quarter seconds, one with 
tri-x b/w, the other with b/w in- 
frared also hung ready — plus a 
70mm panoramic still camera 
shooting color infrared at variable 
speed. All film was inflight-pro- 
cessed. 

IP in three.

His flightseat began to vibrate 
according to the whims of the 
Attention Augmentor. The AA was 
supposed to keep a pilot alert as the 
situation around his plane became 
more demanding. Some airmen 
found it annoying. Most found it 
restful. Cooper generally ignored, 
when possible, its intrusion on his 
concentration. 

He counted six targets up there, 
ranging from white to a deep blush. 
The redder they got, the closer they 
were. He could designate any four 
of them and get a radar or laser 
lock-up for his camera-control. As 
they came into range of one or an- 
other armament, the target tri- 
angles would flash as would the 
code designation of the optimum 
weapon. The computer made the 
selection; the pilot made the kill. 

Not Cooper, of course. His recon 
plane flew unarmed. The only thing 
he could do was run — but he could 
do that impressively. Just over 
Mach three where the air thinned 
out; two point two plus on the deck. 

IP in one. 

He switched momentarily to 
visual. The nose camera gave him a 
fisheye view. Even at one mile up, 
his speed of nearly half a mile a 
second caused the sandstone 
ground features to blur. He made 
out nothing of consequence directly 
ahead though the IP was surely in 
sight. 

He switched back to compfac 
and heard the reduce-speed beeper. 
On the third beep he was throttled 



back to Mach 1.2 automatically, 
still matched by his cover. The lead 
plane was now two klics out front, a 
weak, pointless flak-suppressor. 

IP — now. 

The cameras turned over for five 
seconds then shut down. The flak- 
suppressor dropped back a thou- 
sand meters, his job complete. 
There had been no flak to soak up 
and no gun positions to smoke. The 
radarmap now read IP2: two 

minutes plus. Cooper held his 
speed steady, took a cautious 
breath, just to break the monotony. 

By this time the screen in front of 
him showed eight targets, four of 
them blinking. Nobody was shoot- 
ing, however. That was to be ex- 
pected. 

He zeroed in on one hostile with 
the gun cameras and got a laser 
lock-up. The target made a flyby at 
ten klics high, exposing its armed 
belly. 

The Japanese fighters, code 
name Zato-Ichi, nosed around and 
sometimes buzzed recon missions. 
All quite friendly — so far. But no 
one knew how long the honeymoon 
would last. The groom was getting 
restless. If the secession stuck, the 
U.S. stood to gain exclusive rights 
to the new field when it came on- 
stream. Otherwise the field would 
be exploited by the Japanese as was 
the Murban-Bu Hasa field less than 
sixty kilometers to the west. And if 
they stood for this, they might 
stand for some more. It was impos- 
sible to say for sure, yet nobody

GALAXY 




doubted the importance of Persian 
Gulf oil to a nation that required 
lour or five billion barrels of crude 
every year. 

At IP2 the Persian Gulf coast 
was hastily photographed, but 
Cooper didn’t have time to inspect 
the results. The cameras ran an- 
other five and one-half seconds 
before the recall order came 
through. They were approaching 
the Fateh offshore field. 

Wait . 

Something was happening out 
there. The lead cover plane was 
peeling left, dropping fast. Cooper 
went to visual, found the stubby 
black delta- wing a thousand meters 
out and down, gaining speed, its 
water-charged after-burners lit. 

“What the hell,” he said. 

He impulsively gripped the stick 
and dived after the leader. Below 
he saw the flat blue water and the 
long gray pencil-shape of a mega- 
I anker tied up at deepwater berth. 
In the sea just beyond her forecastle 
lay a storage tank, its dome some 
hundred meters across, containing 
perhaps 600k barrels down to the 
underwater rimline. 

The lead plane swung wide 
around and dived on the tanker, 
apparently intent on blasting her. 
Two long dark pods separated from 
the wings. Empty drop tanks. The 
pilot obviously wanted more speed. 

Who the hell was that? Willis? 
Baker? Of course. Baker! What the 
hell— 

“Baker. Baker?” he yelled on the 



intercom. “Break off, break off!” 

“Shut up, Cooper.” 

“God damn it, Baker, you’re out 
of your mind.” 

He glanced at the screen; the 
lead plane had armed several HE 
air-to-surface missiles. 

Jesus, Baker! 

Capt. Cooper throttled up, strok- 
ed the burners and cut across the 
chord of his curving pursuit, simul- 
taneously pickling his own empty 
wing tanks. He passed Mach two — 
point one, point two, point four, his 
G-reaction suit squeezing him in 
craft-stress warning. 

A buzzer sounded and the comp- 
fac screen indicated a target closing 
fast on Cooper’s own tail — bright 
red, blinking furiously. Where the 
hell was Willis? 

Decelerating to Mach two-oh in 
one and a half seconds, he caught 
up a mile from the tanker and 
planted himself below and in front 
of the cover plane. 

“Damn you,” Baker said as they 
flew formation a hundred meters 
over the tanker. 

The Zato-Ichi pulled out at the 
last second, climbing left and de- 
celerating. 

Cooper accelerated right, climb- 
ed and gained a post above and be- 
hind Baker. 

Best I could do, thought Baker. 
Still, the shock waves alone would 
have caused enough damage to pro- 
voke a strong Japanese protest to 
DeeCee. What the hell was going 
on? 



TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY

II 

I t was evening in Darwin as they 
helped Cooper out of his G-suit. 
He walked moodily to the med- 
center and sat on a plastic bench to 
wait his turn at debriefing. Some- 
body grabbed his shoulder and 
spun him around. 

“Cooper, you idiot,” Baker said. 
“Me?” 

“Let me tell you something, 
Cooper.” Baker was savagely rip- 
ping the velcro seams of his G-suit. 
“You just stay the hell away from 
me. Understand?” 

“Baker, you got bubbles in your 
brain. You tried to smoke that 
tanker!” 

“Tried, my left nut. I’d have 
done it if you hadn’t busted in. Let 
me give you a piece of advice, 
Cooper. Don’t pull a stunt like that 
on me again. Ever!” 

A medical officer walked up to 
them. “Next.” 

Colonel Baker said, “Debrief 
this insubordinate bastard. I’ll be 
back in half an hour when I cool 
off. Going to the Club.” 

When they were alone the doc 
said, “He’s blowing smoke on your 
little tushy again. You must be 
doing something right.” 

Cooper just shook his head. 
“That guy may be an idiot,” the 
doc went on, “but he’s got a piece 
of paper that says he owns your ass. 
You’d better lighten up.” 

“Me? I don’t believe this! If he 
goes on like he’s been going, we’ll 



be up to our ears in a shooting-war 
with the Japs — and nothing that’s 
happened in the last ten years justi- 
fies that.” 

“True.” 

“Makes you wonder.” 

“What?” 

“That guy’s a colonel with fifteen 
years in grade. They know he’s a 
good pilot but they don’t trust 
him.” 

“Yeah, but he’s the boss, 
Cooper.” 

“That’s what scares me.” 
“Racist.” 

“Screw you.” 

O ne hour later in the officer’s 
mess. 

“Cooper? The CO wants to see 
you.” 

“Can’t you see I’m eating my 
supper?” 

The sergeant merely stood siient 
by the table. Cooper had a ten- 
dency to eat alone. He liked to 
think it was not his choice but he 
was beginning to wonder. 

“All right. Be with you in a 
minute.” 

The sergeant turned his head an 
inch toward the door, his eyes still 
on Cooper’s. 

The captain threw down his fork 
and made a lot of noise getting to 
his feet. 

“My pleasure.” 

The sergeant followed closely in 
the corridor, clicking the linoleum. 
He escorted Cooper to the door,

opened it, closed him inside. 

In fresh fatigues, Baker was 
sitting behind his desk reading a 
paperback mystery novel. He look- 
ed once at Cooper, then went on 
reading for five minutes while 
Cooper watched. Baker had kept 
himself fit into his middle fifties. A 
career flier who had passed his 
forty-fourth birthday in the air over 
Nam during the celebrated Christ- 
mas bombings prior to the cease- 
lire. He was proud of that. They 
called him Super J inker because of 
the way he twisted, climbed and 
swiveled his Phantom 4C coming 
out of a bomb run. A bona fide 
terror of the airways. 

He finished a chapter, said, “Ha. 

I knew' it.” He flung the book down 
split on the desktop. 

“Cooper, Cooper, Captain 
Cooper, what do you think? You 
think I’m the big black bogieman 
out to gobble up your tender white 
butt?” 

“No, sir. You’re not so big,” 

“Ha?” 

“You’re—” 

“Shut up. Cooper. I’m going to 
set you straight right now. And get 
this, Cooper. If you’re not straight, 
absolutely straight, after our little 
talk, if you still harbor any niggling 
doubts about anything — then from 
now on your life is going to be aw- 
fully complicated.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Shut up, Cooper. Hear this. 
The world runs on oil, right? You 
can forget your silly pipe-dreams of 



unlimited nuclear power, at least 
for the next ten or twenty years. 
Things just haven’t worked out in 
that area. So we gotta get that oil. 
This year the good citizens of North 
America would surely like to get 
their milts on a billion and a half 
tons of the stuff — tons, I said. But 
the funny thing is, those fine people 
have dug and sniffed around the 
continent and have come up with 
only about eight hundred million 
tons, shale oil and all . 

“Colonel, sooner or later the 
North Slope oil will — ” 

“Later, not sooner. The first fifty 
million tons of that Alaskan crude 
got itself contaminated. The oil 
companies won’t touch it, say it’s 
too hot to refine at present. Mean- 
while our good buddy Japan has 
been getting a steady flow from the 
Middle East. LNG, too. They were 
also getting some stuff from our 
other good buddy, Russia. They 
went and built the trans-Siberian 
pipeline so they could load up off- 
shore at Nochodka. But some time 
ago the Soviets said they’re plenty 
sorry, they’ve got mechanical diffi- 
culty on that pipeline. The Russian 
oil just dried up. And remember 
that deal with Canada to dig into 
the Athabasca tar sands? Fell 
through, for reasons which should 
be obvious. Point is, Cooper, they 
just can’t afford to lose this thing 
near Abu Dhabi. They got a fleet of 
megatankers doing nothing but 
making the run to and from the 
Gulf. Each ship hauls nearly a mil-

lion tons of crude, making nine or 
ten round trips a year. Yet right 
now Japan has only a sixteen-day 
reserve at home. Sixteen days! 
They’re tearing their hair out by the 
roots.” 

‘‘Sir, I don’t see what bearing 
that has on — ” 

‘‘Shut up.” Baker rose and strode 
to a wall-map, pointed at the Malay 
Peninsula. ‘‘More than ten years 
ago they went and blocked the 
Strait of Malacca and the Singa- 
pore Strait for themselves by build- 
ing supertankers. Now they got the 
megatankers. Half a klic long and, 
fully loaded, more than sixty-five 
feet of draft. The Straits aren’t 
deep enough to be navigated by 
ships that low in the water. Well, 
neither were most of the ports. 
Some the Japan boys dug out. In 
general though, except in crowded 
shipbuilding harbors like I.H.I. at 
Yokohama, they did what every- 
body else was doing — put down off- 
shore deepwater single-point moor- 
ings. And to kick this Malacca 
Strait problem, they merely set up a 
pair of berths on opposite sides of 
the Isthmus of Kra, here at the nar- 
rowest point of the peninsula. They 
built ten million-barrel storage 
tanks at either end and rescheduled 
their tanker routes. These days 
about a third of their megatankers 
make the run between the Gulf and 
the tanks, the rest running north to 
the Islands. Their only hang-up is 
that fifty-inch pipeline between the 
mountains of the Isthmus. It’s even 



more vulnerable than the Straits.” 

“I heard they mean to dig a 
canal.” 

‘‘Can’t set up permission from 
either Thai government. So that 
pipeline will be the big show for at 
least another ten years. And if it 
ever springs a leak, they simply 
haven’t got enough shallow-draft 
tankers to pick up the slack by 
negotiating the Straits. They’d have 
to run their megatankers at half 
load, and that would eat them up in 
fuel consumption. It costs them 
seventy-five hundred tons of low- 
sulphur diesel oil every round trip.” 

Baker sat back down. Cooper re- 
mained standing in front of the 
desk. 

‘‘Cooper, none of this is news to 
you . I’m sure some sleepy lieutenant 
dumped this load on you weeks, 
maybe months ago. The point you 
seem to be missing is what the 
situation has to do with our actions 
in the field. The Japs are pressed so 
hard against the well-known wall 
they can feel the other side. Which 
isn’t surprising, considering it’s us 
on the other side — leaning against 
them. This planet isn’t rich enough 
to support us both with all our in- 
dustry, or even most of it. We’re 
both of us in the same goddamn 
hole and now we’re getting ready 
for a fight over the ladder. And two 
things are important. One, that 
they should start it — and two, that 
we should win it.” 

“All this should be clear to you; 
if they haven’t got the guts they 



68 



GALAXY 




showed at Pearl Harbor we’ll just 
have to prod them a bit. So today I 
made my little pass at a mega- 
tanker in the Gulf. The Zato-Ichi 
on my tail might have been spooked 
enough to take a shot at me, but 
your interference was so obviously a 
saving gesture that he knew he 
could just sit up there and watch 
you make a fool out of both of 
us. This will not happen again.” 

‘‘And what if we do it — what if 
we win it and the oil lifeline just 
stops? What will the Japanese do 
then?” 

‘ Take a short cut to the Stone 
Age I suppose — what the hell do I 
care? Go back to your soyasteak, 
Cooper.” 

“Sir.” 

‘‘Tell you something, Cooper. 
We don’t get this oil, we might as 
well hang it up. In the spring of 
forty-five I was humping it in the 
South Pacific, fighting Japs. I was 
seventeen goddamn years old, 
Cooper, busting my black ass to 
beat those yellow bastards. And we 
did beat’ em, beat’ em bad. So thirty 
years later they were tearing the 
guts out of our economy — and two 
years ago they went number two in 
the world! All the while they’ve 
been getting their oil steady from 
the Arabs while we’ve been getting 
hind teat and a boot in the butt. 
God damn it. Cooper, we owe it 
to’em.” 

“Sir.” 

“Go back to your soyasteak, 
Cooper.” 



Cooper wandered down the halls. 
Okay, now he was straight. 

Ill 

T hey rousted him at four, flash- 
light in his eyes, rough hands on 
his back. 

“Cooper? Outta the sack. Go get 
a preflight, get suited, and get to 
the duty room at five. That’s five! 
You got a mission.” 

“I flew yesterday!” 

“Hit it.” 

Ten minutes later Cooper pushed 
open the door of the medcenter. It 
was virtually deserted. 

“What the hell,” he said. “We 
flew yesterday.” 

“No shit,” Willis said. “We must 
be good.” 

“I wonder,” Cooper responded 
gloomily. 

The sergeant who came in next 
looked as if he had been up all 
night. Probably he had. He began 
to give Willis the preflight physical. 

“Wait a minute,” Cooper said. 
“Where’s the doc?” 

“In dreamland.” 

“Why isn’t he here?” 

“He was on call last night, so 
he’s off today.” 

“Everybody’s off today but us.” 
“Me, too,” the sergeant said. 
“I’m off today, too.” 

“What the hell kind of war we 
running here?” That from Willis. 
“Unscheduled.” 

“Don’t you believe it,” Cooper 
said. 



TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY 



69 




The two pilots sat in the duty 
room from five until five-thirty, 
then Baker came in. Suited up, he 
gave out with his special preflight 
everything’s-in-the-bag-baby grin. 

“Don’t eat breakfast,” he said. 

They groaned. Who could eat? 

Baker winked. “Got here a spe- 
cial flight for my special aces. Let 
me give you some background.” 

He paused to light up a preflight 
cigar and to pull down a map of 
Southeast Asia. Japanese shipping 
routes were lined in red, the cross- 
peninsula pipeline in black. He 
grabbed a pointer and indicated a 
spot in the Indian Ocean. 

“Right there, as of half an hour 
ago, is a Jap carrier. She’s mother- 
ing at least forty Zato-Ichis, five to 
seven of which are constantly air- 
borne. Mainly they cover the Gulf 
and the pipeline. Yesterday we frol- 
icked at the Zone of Conflict and 
over the Gulf. This morning we’re 
going to do a number on the pipe- 
line. Yes, Cooper, we’re really 
going to do it.” 

“Why?” 

“Shut up, Cooper. Any more 
questions? No? Good. Listen up. 
We strongly suspect the Japs have 
nuclear weapons stored on that 
carrier and deploy them on those 
planes. Pictures you made yester- 
day showed something new slung 
under the wings.” 

“Where’d they get them?” Willis 
asked. 

“Good question. Probably from 
France. But they might even be 



homemade — their professed aver- 
sion to atomics never made any 
sense to me. Their right-wing has 
been pushing quietly for nuke 
capability since the late sixties. 
They claimed a tactical-nuke ar- 
senal necessary for the Self-Defense 
Forces — and I have to agree with 
them there. In the early seventies 
Japan was on N-2 status, which 
meant they could develop the hard- 
ware within two years of go. Five 
years later they were at N-l, and 
two years ago we clocked them at 
N-O.5. Well, they’ve had the time 
and they sure as hell have had the 
incentive! — ” 

“That doesn’t mean they’re go- 
ing to use them.” 

“Good point, Cooper. You’re 
right — there’s a disturbing possi- 
bility they might manage to restrain 
themselves. This mission is design- 
ed to eliminate that possibility.” 

“How?” 

“Simple. The Japanese can’t 
afford a break in that pipeline. 
Under any circumstances. So it’s 
reasonable to assume they’ll defend 
it to the bitter end. If Willis were to 
buzz it, they would certainly be 
looking to blast him out of there. 
Fact is, though, they could do it 
with conventional high explosives, 
and for our purposes that’s not 
good enough. We need a Tonkin 
that can’t be doubted. The hope is 
that with an unarmed recon plane 
along they’ll think we’re just on 
another snapshot session, so they’ll 
hesitate. When they do see it’s a 



70 



GALAXY 




bomb run going down they’ll be 
committed to a large kill radius — 
larger than HE can produce — large 
enough to make nuke imperative.” 
“Cute,” Cooper conceded. 

“So that’s it,” Baker said, rolling 
the cigar in his mouth. “Willis goes 
up in one big-ass fireball and you, 
Cooper, catch all this Oriental 
villainy on film.” 

“Yeah, cute,” said Willis. 

Baker strolled out, and on down 
the corridor to Operations to check 
the weather. 

Cooper looked at Willis. “You 
think he’s serious? Think he’d 
really set you up like that?” 

Willis smiled. “Don’t know. That 
damned plane of mine cost ten 
million, stripped.” 

IV 

M ore delays. Fueling problems. 

And the question hardened in 
Cooper’s mind: is this mission 
authorized? 

Baker finally came back, looking 
sour. 

“Okay, we’re set.” 

No more questions. 

By 0300Z they were two miles 
over Singapore. It was midmorning 
local. Trees mounted the slopes of 
the peninsular range. The forma- 
tion swung right, heading closer to 
due north to avoid the higher peaks 
and possible turbulence. They 
would approach the pipeline from 
the southeast, from the Gulf of 
Siam. 



Cooper returned to compfac 
mode and watched for targets. He 
was brooding about Baker’s orders. 
How much of this mission was of- 
ficial — and how much was the re- 
sult of an old soldier’s tortuous 
reading of his government’s secret 
wishes? It was clear he meant to 
risk valuable government property. 
Risk, hell. He meant to destroy a 
plane. And where would that leave 
Willis? 

IP in twelve minutes — mark. 

The rear target alarm buzzed. 
Cooper checked it out. The bogie 
was out of range, closing for a 
minute or so then breaking off. 
Ahead the sky stretched clear. 

Soon, though, Zato-Ichis would 
collect around them. Most likely 
that rear target would request con- 
firmation of what was guessed 
about the mission; the resulting 
scramble might bring out a pretty 
fair number of defenders. Wait and 
see. 

IP in eight. 

Baker came on the line. “Coop- 
er, I’m going to follow you all the 
w'ay in this time. In a minute or two 
Willis is going up front. Keep him 
in your cameras at all times — close- 
up on the video, wide angle with the 
movie camera. When we reach IP, 
I’ll direct your flight according to 
ambience. If more than a single 
Zato tails Willis, you might have to 
draw one off. The more conven- 
tional firepower they have avail- 
able, the less likely they are to go 
nuke. Check?” 



TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY 



71 




“Check,” Willis said. 

“Check?” 

“Yeah,” Cooper muttered. 

Glancing at his camera-status 
lights, he obtained a radar lock-up 
on Willis and tied the 16mm to the 
fire-control system. Because he 
figured to do the video on manual, 
he activated a monitor beside the 
radarmap. After a few seconds he 
changed his mind and tied the 
video cameras into the IFC net. 

IP in five. 

Then, happening to look, Cooper 
was startled by six steady pink 
triangles clustered left on the 
screen. When he concentrated he 
could hear the faint target-up warn- 
ing hum. His Attention Augmentor 
seemed out of action. He hoped 
Baker was paying enough atten- 
tion — then he realized how silly it 
was to give a thought to Baker’s 
combat acuity. Ironically, he felt 
safe with Baker behind him. Noth- 
ing could happen to Cooper, only to 
Willis. For a moment he felt light- 
headed. What a joke. 

He recalled Rule Number One. 
Anyone who isn’t completely terri- 
fied doesn’t fully understand the 
situation. 

The triangles began to blink, 
growing redder steadily. The comp- 
fa c screen bathed them all in a pink 
aura, printing out in white letters 
the optimum weapon for use 
against any one of them. He saw 
that Baker had the proper system 
armed: a video air-to-air missile. 
Then Cooper noted the designated 



warhead code: not HE, but XS — a 
small (0.5 kt) tactical nuke. 

IP in three. 

Two more triangles entered the 
screen directly ahead of them. As 
he watched they went from steady 
white to red and flashing, then 
veered right. The circle of the lead 
plane pulled slowly ahead and took 
up a position some two thousand 
meters in front of his plane. 

“Follow him in,” Baker ordered. 

“1 am!” 

Cooper looked at the compfac. 
They were back over the forest now. 
He saw the black delta-wing of 
Willis's plane centered in the video 
monitor cross-hairs, the light from 
his twin exhausts fuzzing the pic- 
ture. 

IP in one. 

“Close up! Close up!” 

He nudged the throttle and shor- 
tened the gap to one klic. The rear 
target buzzer was eating itself up. 
Three flashing red triangles raced 
two klics behind Baker. 

IP . now! 

“Cameras? Cameras?” 

“Negative. We break. Drop your 
tanks. Everybody go two-oh on 
three. One-two-//m'e. ” 

They maneuvered. 

In a moment they were over the 
Gulf again, flying due east at Mach 
two. 

“What happened?” Cooper ask- 
ed. 

"Weren’t enough takers on that 
one," Baker said. “We’ll have to go 
around again.”

“Jesus Christ.” 

“Shut up, Cooper.” 

They Hew halfway to Pointe de 
Camau then did three-sixty. The 
computer compared inertial guid- 
ance with the Doppler radar, and 
both against a navaid pulse from 
(he local 13.1 kHz Omega xmtr, 
then set up a new course back to IP. 

“We better make it good this 
time,” Baker said. “We’re running 
out of juice. I don’t want to have to 
buy fuel on the way back.” 

Yeah, thought Cooper. Might be 
embarrassing to order up a tanker 
(o wet-nurse some birds that 
weren’t supposed to be Hying. 

“ This time Cooper hangs back. 
Let the lead plane look good and 
mean and maybe they’ll get the 
idea. We’ll come in on the length of 
(he pipeline this time, from the 
northeast. Willis, you get in close 
and let loose an HE Sleuth. But 
keep an eye out. I want you to have 
time to send your shot wild before 
they make the kill. I don’t think it 
would be a good idea to harm that 
pipeline during our friendly recon 
mission. Check?” 

They checked. 

IP in three. 

All right targets were back on the 
screen, now' evenly dispersed over 
(he horizon in front of them. Look- 
ed as if the Japanese were aroused 
(his time. 

Cooper checked the board again. 
Willis was still in the cross-hairs, 
all cameras greentime. 

IP was the east end of the pipe- 

TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY 



line. Tough visually camouflaged, 
its heat-signature was unmistake- 
able. When they reached it there 
were three red bogies on their tails, 
the closest barely a thousand meters 
behind Baker. 

“Stay clear, Cooper.” 

They throttled back and gained 
altitude until the lead plane w>as ob- 
viously on its own. The three Zatos 
passed beneath them, following 
Willis down to the pipeline. 

“Okay, Cooper, go in there and 
pull one of those guys out. I’ll take 
the other one. Start north then cut 
back to the pipeline and be ready to 
snap the action.” 

They dived on the triangles. 
When Baker made a feint at the 
pipeline, one of the defenders 
broke off and slid back to cover 
him. Both drifted to the south. 

Cooper saw them go and tried to 
pull the same trick. He was now in 
the all-target mode, and one of the 
Hashing red triangles, his target, 
seemed to hesitate. The R code was 
blinking as the Japanese plane 
stopped receding and verged on 
closing when Cooper slowed. It was 
curious about the plane’s actions. 
It wanted to investigate but was not 
sure it should. Both defenders were 
five hundred meters behind Willis, 
obviously watching him closely. 
They considered corraling that lead 
American plane imperative but one 
of them. Cooper’s target, began to 
slow noticeably. 

“Come on, sucker — ” 

Just then Willis fired his mis- 

73 




sile — too early! Purposely he fish- 
tailed it to leave no doubt he was 
flying it himself via the secure tv 
datalink. That made it amply clear 
to one and all that downing Willis 
would be no mere act of after-the- 
fact revenge. That standoff missile 
snaking its way toward the precious 
pipeline was controlled from trans- 
mitters contained in his plane and 
nowhere else. 

Both triangles settled down for 
the kill. 

Cooper saw there was no point in 
trying to lure away any of those 
fighters now. It suddenly occurred 
to him that his obvious lack of ar- 
maments made him a rather pathe- 
tic judas goat. Nothing to do now 
but roll the cameras. 

Willis was stuck fast in the cross- 
hairs of the monitor, locked in by 
skin-track radar. Cooper was ready 
to take pictures as soon as the 
fighters — 

There! 

One of the Zatos had fired a mis- 
sile, triggering the cameras. Willis 
abruptly pulled up and tried to 
evade but — 

“Damn it!” Baker said. 

The white circle of the lead plane 
vanished from the compfac screen. 

“Damn it!” 

Cooper went to nose camera and 
saw a cloud of debris floating down 
toward the brushland. 

“Damn it!” 

The radiation curve was flat. 

“Cooper! Shut down your 
cameras.” 

74 



No fireball. 

He went back to compfac. The 
Sleuth that Willis had fired was 
curving peacefully toward the 
mountainside, locked on a hapless 
bush. There were no targets in 
front of Cooper though the rear- 
target warning was on. For some 
reason his AA had come back on 
the air and was now' prodding him 
vigorously. He swore at it. The re- 
maining white circle. Baker’s, drift- 
ed in from the south, joined forma- 
tion at Cooper’s wingtip. 

“Now what?” Cooper asked. 

“Let me think.” 

“We blew it, right?” 

“Shut up!” 

They were back out over water, 
headed west across the Andaman 
Sea. The screen seemed to vibrate 
in Cooper’s face. Damned AA! 

“You’re still armed,’’ Cooper 
said. 

“I know.” 

“Nuke warheads.” 

“So what?” 

“You’re supposed to go to SAFE 
as soon as all targets-of-opportunity 
are out of the system.” 

There was a long pause, then 
Baker said, “What would you know 
about it, you crummy recon?” 
Cooper shut up for a second, 
wondering what would happen 
next. Baker was desperate. He 
needed a fireball this noon, and 
was just crazy enough to go to any 
length to get it. 

As if on cue the white circle 
broke off to the south, climbing. If 

GALAXY 




lie was right, Baker would try to get 
a clear shot at him, probably from 
behind. 

"Damn you, Baker!” 

No response. 

Cooper’s fingers tightened on the 
stick. 

Okay. 

He banked left and hit the 
burners. He’d have to climb onto 
Baker's tail and stay there. It was 
the only way to prevent him from 
bring. 

Cooper was turning, climbing, 
accelerating so fast the wing-stress 
lights Bashed and the max-G 
alarms went off deafeningly. The 
wing skin-temp passed 200 degrees 
C at 10 Gs. He was close to tearing 
the wings off the bird but that 
wasn’t worrying him now. He was 
getting some unexpected results, 
though; his AA suddenly crapped 
out, apparently convinced he was 
paying the situation ample atten- 
lion. 

The nose camera showed his pro- 
gress, the twin tailpipes of Baker’s 
plane growing larger and brighter 
until proximity alarms sounded. 
Then Cooper cut back and matched 
speed ten meters from nose to tail. 

Baker suddenly twisted down 
and right, and Cooper was practi- 
cally alone in space. 

Damn it, that bastard can fly. 
Super linker. 

Cooper went back to compfac to 
find him, then got a radar lock-up. 
ganged in with the video cameras 
and shut down the wing camera- 



mount servos. As the gun cameras 
snapped to the front zero position 
the plane lurched, trying to catch 
up. Now the computer would ma- 
neuver the whole aircraft to main- 
tain both camera and radar lock- 
up at the same time. He would be 
able to follow Baker’s moves auto- 
matically, no matter how hairy, ac- 
celerating however much necessary 
to hug the colonel’s tail. Till fuel 
ran out. 

Within half a minute Baker’s 
plane was twenty-five meters out 
front, and Cooper got set to have 
his plane towed around the sky for 
a while. 

After three stress-filled minutes, 
during which all the warning 
lights — engine temp, wing-skin 
temp, max-G, hydraulic pressure, 
turbine coolant, power supply 
ripple, low fuel, among others — 
came on and stayed on, Baker 
stopped his maneuvers and settled 
down. They were some five minutes 
west of the pipeline, having made 
several three-sixties in the progress. 
Cooper grabbed some air and 
wiped the sweat out of his eyes. 

Then it happened, without sur- 
prise. 

"Baker, you idiot.” 

No answer, just the XS Sleuth 
heading out straight and smooth, 
now curving slightly to the right, 
moving lazily. 

Cooper could not say anything. 
He knew that missile would be 
coming up his tailpipes in a few 
minutes, after its leisurely circuit. 



TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY

Baker was willing to take them 
both down to gain his bloody fire- 
ball. 

Bastard leaves me no choice, he 
thought, ripping at his harnesses 
and plugs. Does he really think I'm 
going to sit still for this? 

He punched DROP TRACK, re- 
leasing the plane from its duty to 
tail Baker. Then he pulled free 
from the gyro-flightchair, dropped 
his headset, and sent the plane off 
south toward the Indian Ocean. 

He pulled open the door and ran 
out into the hall, skipped past arm- 
ed MPs and paper-carrying clerks. 

“Is the mission over?” someone 
barked. 

“Not yet!" 

He sprinted ten meters up the 
hall to Baker’s room, found Willis 
out front smoking and joking with 
the guard. 

“Out of the way!” 

He had to hit the guard before he 
could get the door open. Baker was 
hunched up over the compfac 
screen, watching the insert video 
monitor as the Sleuth closed on the 
recon ship, Cooper’s ship, a kic and 
a half away. 

He came down on the friend 
switch and Baker’s jaw simultane- 
ously, then he felt the hands on his 
shoulders wrenching him out of 
there. There was just enough time 
to chop the colonel behind the neck 
and end the mission for sure. The 
Sleuth was busy shredding itself 
with TNT, and now maybe some- 
one could jump in and bring both 



the drones home. 

V 

H e drowsed alone in his cell. 

The new Leavenworth Annex 
was quiet. Only five weeks had 
gone by since the raid on the pipe- 
line, when the two drones had been 
left cruising alone over the Indian 
Ocean. They told him Baker’s 
plane had been retrieved electronic- 
ally, rendezvoused with a tanker, 
then Mown back to the American 
carrier south of Java. His plane, 
they said, had dived too low and 
couldn’t be reached before sliding 
into the sea three nautical miles 
north of the Japanese carrier. It 
was probably true. The monitor 
computer considered the facts and 
made its historic judgment: pilot 
captured. 

“It wouldn’t be fair to the spirit 
of war,” Baker had said, a brand- 
new cigar stuck in his mouth. 
“Granted one purpose of RPVs is 
to avoid the POW problem, to keep 
an enemy from gaining hostages — 
but the fact remains they have every 
right to expect a downed pilot not 
be allowed back into the game. 
You’ll be looked after by neutrals 
back in the States. No sweat." 

No sweat. 

Right. 

Besides, it was unpatriotic to 
complain; the war with Japan, you 
know . 

Remember Pearl Harbor! 

Wasn't she a singer?

Cooper droused. Best way to 
spend internment. Then suddenly, 
noise. He opened his eyes. They 
were bringing a visitor into his cell. 
“Back from the dead?” 

“That’s right.” Willis said. 

The guard locked up and went 
off down the empty corridor. 

“You my new roommate?” 
Willis shook his head. “You 
don’t need a roomie.” 

“I’m too self-sufficient?” 

Willis smiled. “Cooper, you need 
all the discipline you can get, but 
you’ll have to look elsewhere for it. 
You’re free.” 

“Free? 1 don’t understand.” 
“Two things. The war’s over — ” 
“Over? Already?” 

“And second, Baker made a mis- 
take putting you under arrest. Your 
plane didn’t go down. It seems he 
invented this POW thing to avoid 
an investigation of the events lead- 
ing up to the, ah, misunderstand- 
ing with Japan.” 

“Mis—” 

“Let me finish!” Willis told him 
how certain complaints about 
Baker had begun to reach the 
upper strata of Air Force authority, 
and how the Inspector General had 
been persuaded to look into the 
matter. 

“You? From the I.G.?" 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” Willis 
said. “I’m a pilot. I know LG. per- 
sonnel who sleep with their shoes 
on ‘cause they can’t get the knots 
out of their shoestrings. And they're 
going to pose as pilots? Anyway, 



the I.G. office got hold of me, 
asked for help. Seems Baker was 
losing computer tapes of certain 
key missions. They needed substan- 
tial proof before they could act, so I 
gave’em tapes of the pipeline mis- 
sion.” 

The I.G. had finally acted, but 
slowly, with the solemnity befitting 
the busting of a Full Colonel. That 
slowness had given Baker time to 
ship Cooper to the States with some 
intriguing data appended to his 
records: Cooper, Bertram Albert. 
Captured 3 Dec 85 during armed 
robbery of WUlowbrook S & L. 
Pratt, Kansas. Convicted 15 Dec 
85. Fourth of fense. No parole. Life. 

Super Jinker. 

“How could he hope to get away 
with it?” 

Willis shrugged. “In a world 
where records speak louder than 
people . .” 

“Where is he now? In jail?” 

“Are you kidding? He resigned 
his commission and his pension 
and started work for a company 
that makes some of the armament 
we haul around in the name of 
peace. He’s a vice president, as a 
matter of fact.” 

Super Jinker. 

And anyway the incipient War, 
the Incident, the Misunderstand- 
ing, was over. Oil Bowed both east 
and west now, giving both nations a 
bit of breathing room as they 
struggled to invent the technology 
that would power the twenty-first 
century. *

WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

DEMETRIOS was born, under 
the name Adam Freeman, in 1980 
at Hestenhlle, Missouri, 13 years 
before the 20-Minute War and the 
following plagues which destroyed 
his family. Adam fell in with a 
party who believed things were 
better in the east. They traveled 
through heat and torrential rains to 
a place called Nuber, in the Cat- 
skills. During the journey a hoy 
Adam loved. Demetrios Makarios, 
destroyed himself unable to endure 
the collapse of his world. The boy's 
mother refused to believe him dead 
and "mistook" Adam for him; he 
supported her delusion by taking 
the name Demetrios, and kept it 
ever after. 

Forty- seven years later, still at 
Nuber, he has become a streetcor- 
ner yarn-spinner, earning the rest 
of his living as janitor in a respect- 
able sex-house in the ‘‘Outer City ", 
Inner City is reserved Jbr the aris- 
tocracy, the new rulers who support 
an uneasy monarchy and call the 
city-state a “King’s Republic". The 
water level has risen in a warming 
climate: wilderness has returned 
over most of North America where 
the sea has not. 



After giving some of his long-ago 
experiences as a streetcorner tale, 
and making a few radical remarks, 
Demetrios is informed by a police- 
man that he must get a license for 
storytelling at Town Hall before he 
can do it again. The little crowd 
breaks up, but two members of it, 
ANGUS BRIDGEMAN, a young 
aristocrat, and GARTH, a stable- 
boy, will go with Demetrios to the 
ends of the earth, and Angus’ wolf- 
hound Brand will be another com- 
panion. In a private conversation in 
the city park, Demetrios learns 
something of Angus’ life in Inner 
City, which is precarious. He also 
recognizes the boy’s quality and 
loves him. They agree to meet to- 
morrow in the same place. 

Demetrios returns to the sex- 
house run by MAM ESTELLE on 
Redcurtain Street. He shares a room 
there with his two closest com- 
panions, THE PROFESSOR [a 
lute-player who never speaks) and 
SOLITAIRE, a girl Demetrios 
found wandering after her loss of 
memory. Mam Estelle and her 
helper BABETTE are also close 
friends of Demetrios, and he some- 
times helps entertain in the Parlor 
with his stories. It is a pleasant life. 



except that everything in Nuber is 
under the shadow of a medievalism, 
a returning dark age. Demetrios 
was the son of a doctor, and re- 
members an age when reason might 
have had a chance. 

In the morning Demetrios goes 
to the Town Hall to see about a 
license, and learns it costs more 
than he can afford. There is an im- 
pending shake-up: the Nuber 
authorities are worried by a new 
sect, the A bramites — and all story- 
tellers and other uncommon people 
are regarded as potential subver- 
sives. The Abramites are followers 
of the prophet Abraham, martyred 
at Nuber 17 years before — the ever- 
recurrent Christ figure who de- 
clares the earth must make way for 
the kingdom of heaven. In the past 
Demetrios has made a streetcorner 
stoiy of the martyrdom — (he saw it 
happen himself) — and is suspected 
of being an A bra mite. 

Inserted here is an excerpt from 
a diaiy kept by Mam Estelle, (and 
others will appear later). She 
rambles considerably, concerned 
with her own past as well as the 
present. She also was born in Old 
Time, indeed is somewhat older 
than Demetrios. In the 20-Minute 
War she lost her lovers and her 
babv whom she adored; she drifted 
to Nuber. worked in the sex- house 
and later inherited the management 
of it. 

(And occasionally you will en- 
counter remarks by “the one who 
writes this book ” and who doesn't 



quite seem to be Pangborn — don’t 
worry about it.) 

After his disturbing interview 
with a police lieutenant who specifi- 
callv warns him against ever telling 
the story of Abraham again, Deme- 
trios goes to the park to meet 
Angus, who is not there. In his dis- 
appointment, and anger at the 
license thing, Demetrios gets a bit 
drunk, and defies fate by drawing a 
crowd and telling the stoiy of Abra- 
ham, as it truly happened. The 
policemen appear as he is finishing, 
and he has a glimpse of Garth ar- 
riving, but not Angus.

The Happenest Day of My Life 

Many heroes lived before Aga- 
memmon, but all are submerg- 
ed in the long night unwept, un- 
known, because they lacked a 
sacred poet. 

—Horace. ODES. IV: 9. 

T he two in dark uniforms ap- 
proached casually — no distur- 
bance wanted — a few yards behind 
Garth’s innocent grin; the boy had 
not caught on. Demetrios let his 
walnut stick tumble at Garth’s feet, 
and stooped for it as he did — he 
would of course, bless him! When 
their heads w'ere close Demetrios 
mumbled: “Keep clear so you can 
help — lose yourself in the crowd, 
fast!’’ A moment of shock, and 
Garth understood; he became a 
blue-eyed fox peering through the

bush of a fat woman’s frizzed-out 
hair ten feet away. 

“Got a license?” They were offi- 
cers Demetrios did not know; but 
they knew him. What have I done? 
What can I prove except my own 
stupid anger? O Solitaire ! — 

He should have thought of her 
before. “License?” 

“Come on,” said the beefy one. 
“You can explain it to Brome.” 

“Cossack!” shouted the woman 
with frizzy hair. “He didn’t do 
nothing only talk about holy Abra- 
ham.” 

“Just keep back, folks. Mind 
your own business.” She did, like 
the rest of the gazing crowd; the 
lean one secured Demetrios’ arm, 
his hands heavy with uneasiness. 

“Why, I’m coming quietly. Mind 
my stick there, it’s a palindrome. 
Lose that or mishandle it and you’ll 
be the sickest man alive.” 

“A what?” 

“Palindrome. At least carry it 
upside down, man, so the power 
won’t flow into your arse cross- 
ways.” 

“Maybe he — uh — better carry it, 
Cass? If it’s one of them what he 
said?” 

“Well, I guess not,” said beefy 
Cass; but on the long walk down 
across the Meadows to the town 
lock-up, Cass held the stick at 
arm’s length, and upside down so 
far as he could without quite know- 
ing which end was the top. 

“Aren’t we going to the Town 
Hall?” 



“Brome is busy, Mister,” said 
Cass. Demetrios saw the pursed 
smile of a bully not quite sure of his 
powers. ‘‘Put up with our hos- 
pitality a while, Mister.” The lean 
one’s hands now held no more than 
a token grip. “Be our guest, Mis- 
ter,” said Cass. 

The lock-up was a one-story 
lump of mortared stone at the end 
of an alley from which a path 
straggled up into the Meadows. 
Oak trees spread green sadness 
over lesser growth by the little jail, 
over its yard with one bench, one 
upright post. Rings on the post 
served for hitching horses, or 
people. No other building stood in 
sight. No sunshine, no breeze — yes, 
there was a breeze, a whish-hush of 
the upper leaves underlining si- 
lence. Daylight, but to Demetrios’ 
mind came the taste of perpetual 
evening. 

The one-eyed stubble-faced 
jailor, his bundle of keys too large 
for him, gazed up at Demetrios 
with the distrustful pleasure the 
man with the club might show be- 
fore a haltered bull. “Cass, what’ve 
you brung me? This ain’t no lazy 
idle beggar. What you done for 
your country, Mister? Been into the 
till? Raped some little twist? Kind 
of forgot your old self in public? 
Hey?” 

“Put him in the tight one,” said 
Cass, “and keep your thoughts in- 
side your brains, Putney. No fra- 
ternizing. Brome says.” 

“1 have news for you, Mister 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY

Cass. We may appeah to live a re- 
tired life heah, but all my three 
apartments is full. Mister Cass, 
and what do you think of that?” 
“Put him in with Bosco then, it’ll 
make a pair of em. But no frater- 
nizing with this’n. Oh, and keep 
this some place.” Cass set the stick 
respectfully in a corner of the room 
that served Putney as reception 
hall, office, kitchen, bedroom; a 
chamber-pot stood out from under 
the bed doubling as spittoon. The 
inner door gave on a corridor serv- 
ing the three cells; Putney liked to 
keep it closed, enjoying his privacy 
and his own flavors. 

Demetrios was relieved of his 
tinder-box and the few coins he had 
salvaged from his cap. Cass and the 
lean man departed as soon as 
Demetrios stood safe and harmless 
on the wrong side of Cell 2’s metal 
door. Putney lingered. “I’ll tend to 
your comfort. No talking, mind.” 
He opened a door down the corri- 
dor on a storage shed. 

“He says no talking,” said the 
bear-like man cross-legged on a 
heap of straw. “It’s kind of like his 
cough. I’m Bosco.” 

“Demetrios. How do?” 

“Fair to shitty. Glad to know y’.” 
“No talking!’’ Putney bustled 
back with straw on a pitchfork. 

“He has this problem,” said Bos- 
co. “How to unlock the fucking 
door without putting down the 
straw. Give it up. Putney?” 

“Up yours too.” Putney set down 
the load and worked the key. 



“Stand back. This here’s a self-ser- 
vice reform school, Mister Fancy — 
you make your own bed.” He flung 
the straw to the free side of the cell, 
and leaned on the fork, dim and 
droopy in the watery light from one 
barred window high in the north 
wall. “That all the money you 
had?” 

“Ayah. When do I get to see 
Lieutenant Bronte?” 

“Can't figure the way you people 
come snorting and piss-assing in 
here without no money. You a’n’t 
that stupid, you’d ought to know it 
costs like any place else. Don’t 
worry about Bronte.” Putney back- 
ed off fretfully, his key rattled in 
the wards, and he spoke from be- 
hind the gate’s protection. “Cass or 
Jack’ll get word to your people 
after-while, likely. We’re good 
about that.’’ He giggled. “We 
a’way-s notify the next of skin.” A 
fine, no doubt, and Mam Estelle 
would feel obliged to pay it. Trouble 
walks with me. “No talking now,” 
said Putney, and he trotted off to 
his own burrow.

“One beat up and could be dead

for a hundred and not too lively — 
you might hear him sing, or ask for 
vitaminds, whatever they be. Care 
for a marawan candy? Can’t light 
up nothing in there, account of the 
straw.”

“Thanks, Bosco.” Demetrios 
chewed the aromatic trifle; a light 
sedative would be welcome. “Been 
here a while?” 

“Long enough to get three days 
older.” Settled on the not uncom- 
fortable straw, Demetrios consider- 
ed his companion — smooth-flowing 
muscle, upper arms like a bear’s 
hams. Bosco was hairy but neat, 
the brown shag of his head some- 
what combed. He smelled sweaty 
but not rancid; probably liked to 
wash when he got the chance. 
“Misunderstanding and hard luck 
brung me low, Demetrios. See, 
there was this sucking pig come up 
to the fence when 1 happened to be 
leaning over, and I could see he was 
the one too many in the litter, hav- 
ing a hard time. So 1 picks him up, 
and I was going happy down the 
road planning a short life and a 
merry one for the dear little fella, 
when these two cops come out of 
the bushes, rot them. Same two 
bastards that brung you in, and 
don’t it beat all Christ the way they 
hunt in pairs? — Cass alone I 
could’ve handled, no trouble. 1 got 
my little friend tucked out of sight, 
but he tickled me working his feet 
around, the way 1 couldn’t help 
laughing like somebody’d left me 
money. This Cass he says, ‘I de- 
clare to God 1 think you got a shoat 
under your coat.’ Why, I told the 
son of a bitch, I says, ‘I’m just 
taking him to his mother, a'n’t that 
all right?’ They never believe you if 
you’re from out of town. Then in 



the follering argument the thin 
one — that’s Jack Jellicoe, meaner’n 
a cat turd, you want to keep away 
from him — he leaned his club on 
the back of my head. I still got the 
lump, been here three days waiting 
for the Public Defender to come 
back from wherever he’s resting his 
arse amongst the lilies, and they got 
the pig. See, I’d come to think of 
him as my little pig. Bugger me 
blind if I think the original owner 
ever saw hide or trotters of him 
again, and they call this a King’s 
Republic?” 

“They do for a fact. From out of 
town, you said?” 

“Born and raised amongst the 
Ramblers. I might be one of Boss 
Gammo’s own get — of course he 
said that about every promising 
sprout in the gang, said it’d been 
sired by the blunt end of a hurri- 
cane and the hurricane was him. 
Ever hear of Boss Gammo?” 
“Why, a caravan gang that 
called themselves Ramblers came 
here to Nuber eight years ago. That 
name rings a bell.” 

“Do say!” Bosco’s heavy face 
grew alert; sad, too. “Boss Gammo 
he never cut his hair, tied it behind 
him with a hempen string. Said it 
was his strength, like this Simpson 
or Sampson or somebody.” 

“That’s the man. They only put 
on one show. Good entertainment I 
thought — I’m a storyteller by trade 
myself — but then some crud started 
a riot, heads got cracked, the police 
ran them out of town. Since then all

Ramblers have been turned away 
from the Nuber border posts.” 

‘‘If that a’n’t just like a King’s 
Republic! Eight years ago? Four 
years after I left’em. Was his hair 
a-whitening? Gammo?” 

‘‘Pepper-and-salt. But I got only 
a glimpse of him, Bosco.” 

“Aye-so.” The big man rocked 
himself back and forth on the 
straw, assailed by grief. ‘‘Eight and 
four is twelve, a’n’t it? And I must 
be crowding thirty, like. Why, I 
could lick Boss Gammo now, if I’d 
ever catch up with the lot. See, 
Demetrios, I figured to lick him 
when I was eighteen, but that was 
too soon, and when the stars quit 
twinkling inside my brains so’s I 
could get up off the ground. Boss 
Ganimo he says to me, ‘Bosco, 
there a’n’t no room for you and me 
both. You’d come up ahint me one 
day,’ he says. I won’t say I 
wouldn’t’ve. Picked on me, that 
man did, oncet he prac’ly grabbed 
off a girl right out from under me. 
‘Come back,’ he says, ‘when you 
think you’re big enough and dam- 
fool enough, we’ll talk about it 
some more.’ Why, I could lick him 
now for sure, only I can’t find’em. 
Last year I chased a rumor up into 
Adirondack Island. I been here and 
there — Jasus, I’ve even lived honest 
now and then. With a lumber gang, 
and up to the iron mines at Hallo- 
way, oarsman a while onto the 
Albany ferry — that’s nearabout 
slavery, that is.” 

“1 hear there are several Rambler 



gangs nowadays.” 

‘‘But Gammo’s is the one and 
only original. Boss Gammo he 
think up the whole idear — mule- 
wagons, singers, tumblers, news- 
carrying, fortune-telling, the whole 
bit. Them others don’t amount to 
shit alongside Gammo’s. I could’ve 
joined one if I wanted. It’s like laid 
onto me, I got to catch up with 
Gammo’s. Sometimes I get think- 
ing, O Jasus, what if Gammo he’s 
gone and died on me, the way I’ll 
never have no other chance to beat 
up on the old son of a whore. They 
'wouldn’t change the name, bound 
to be still Gammo’s Ramblers. 
What if it was Bosco’s, hey? Bos- 
co’s Ramblers, how’s that sound?” 

‘‘Sounds great.” 

Through the waning of the after- 
noon Bosco talked on about a world 
that Demetrios knew of as though it 
hung like a distorting curtain be- 
tween him and the vanished other 
truths of Old Time. There are pi- 
rates in the little islands of Moha 
Water who take an almost fixed 
percentage of the trade between 
Adirondack Island and the republic 
of Moha that precariously owns it. 
Angus, could you not come to me? 

Except when they steal children 
or women, or torture a captain for 
information about other shipping, 
that’s almost a comfortable sort of 
piracy there in Moha Water, like a 
god-damn tax, nothing like the 
vicious operations in the southern 
Hudson Sea. Down there the buc- 
caneers have virtually closed the 



84 



GALAXY 




area to all vessels except the most 
swift and well-armed, and so now 
the pirates range in search of vic- 
tims far up and down the coast, 
and some time soon the King’s Re- 
public will have to clean them out, 
which means a navy and likely a 
small war. Some say the people of 
Conicut are hand in glove with’em. 
Solitaire . Puesan ... Yet the 
world that Bosco was idly holding 
up for him to see had its own 
power, its own pull. 

Red bear are seen more and 
more often these days on Adiron- 
dack Island. Bosco himself had 
been shown the pelt of one at a 
settlement called Saubel, and it 
covered the whole floor of a twelve 
by fifteen room, no lie . In Vair- 
mount they are plagued by a kind 
of wolf like nothing anyone heard 
of before, monstrous, black, long 
in the leg and [folk say] supernatu- 
ral ly clever as the Devil himself . 
Bosco had heard — but was not sure 
he believed the tale — of an isolated 
family somewhere in Hampsher 
completely destroyed by a swarm of 
the small red-brown rats, that 
acted like a swarm of ants ... In 
Main, or anyhow somewhere in 
eastern New England, there’s a 
tribe that worships the brown tiger, 
calling him Eye of Fire . 

Slowly in gray-green light the 
afternoon perished, dwindled from 
the barred window. Putney brought 
a dinner of stew and flabby tea. In 
Cell 3, soft snoring shifted to 
tremulous ancient song: 



“I hope to read my title clear 
To mansions in the skies — ” 

— and again, without change, and 
again. When Putney set food in 
there, the old voice pleaded: “I 
want my vitamins. I want my vita- 
mins. I want my vitamins.” 

On the far side of the corridor, 
well beyond any reach from the 
cells, Putney placed two tallow 
candles that might sputter half the 
night. “I want my vitamins . .” 
No sound came from Cell 1. Putney 
hastily slapped down a plate in 
there and backed out muttering 
something Demetrios could not in- 
terpret. 

“Some day, Put,” said Bosco, 
“you better give Gran’dad his vita- 
mins. What be they anyhow?” 
“None of your mothering busi- 
ness,” said Putney in an evil tem- 
per, and slammed the door again 
between his privacy and theirs. 

an hour faded, and the barred 
window high in the wall was 
giving on a darkness profound and 
starless, yet there must have been a 
field of brilliance beyond the shroud 
of the oaks. Demetrios and Bosco 
had shoved their dirty plates under 
the door, where Putney collected 
them in glum silence; the old man 
in Cell 3 was snoring, the other cell 
as dead in quiet as before; Putney’s 
door slammed again and no more 
was heard from him. A breeze drift- 
ed through the window, cooling the

85 




cell, touching the candles in the 
corridor with a restlessness. Their 
warm small light, abandoning 
Bosco to the shadows, shone on the 
verticals of the bars with illusion of 
softness. You could push your hand 
clear through them. Someone had. 

Two hands, rather small. The 
fingers curled over the metal, pale 
separate lights. A face was pressing 
close to the barricade deeply sha- 
dowed by it, and it was rounded 
like Garth’s with heavy eyebrows 
under yellow hair, but more deli- 
cate, with a certain sweet reckless- 
ness that Garth had left behind or 
perhaps never allowed himself. 
“Ssst! Hey! Demetrios!” 

By standing on tiptoe Demetrios 
could bring his eyes level with the 
boy’s. “You must be Frankie.” The 
eyes sparkled with the delights of 
danger. 

“Garth’s here too. I’m like sitting 
on his neck.” 

“I can’t hardly gosemplace any- 
where without the Plague coming 
along,” said Garth, unseen. “Be 
you by lone, Demetrios?” 

“You’d be lost without me, 
Clunk. You know I’m the brains of 
the outfit. No, there’s another ga 
with him.” 

“You can trust me, kid,” said 
Bosco, moving on silent bear-feet to 
the door of the cell where he could 
watch the corridor. “I’ll keep 
looksy, Demetrios — go ahead and 
talk to your friends.” 

Frankie frowned a question 
about him; Demetrios nodded — 



Bosco wouldn’t peach on a fellow 
jailbird. Demetrios strained higher, 
trying to see Garth; the sill was too 
wide. Close at his ear Frankie mur- 
mured: “Going to spring you, 
duck-soupy it is.” 

“Lordy! I’d have to get out of 
town then.” 

“We all go,” whispered Frankie. 
“You, me , the Clunk — me and the 
Clunk got nothing but hell at home 
since Ma died, the way he keeps 
bringing home them dirty pigs and 
never sober — ” 

“Come on. Plague, he don’t want 
to hear about that. But that’s how 
it is, Demetrios, we all want out. 
Mister Angus he’s shook up — ” 

“God, you’ve seen him?” 

“Sure have. Listen, there’s a 
purge going in Inner City. His 
mother — oh, he’ll tell you about it. 
They’re after him too. He slipped 
out the north gate last night, him 
and the dog, had to knock out a 
guard. By daylight he worked 
around through the woods to the 
Redcurtain Street side, took a 
chance asking his way to Mam Es- 
telle’s, you was gone when he got 
there. Mam Estelle hid him up 
safe. I talked to him there after I 
seen what happened at the Mea- 
dows. Mister Angus come, see, for 
to tell you it’s worse for you than 
you thought. Heard people talking 
about you. Calling you an Abram- 
ite and a foreign spy. It’s the 
Abramites they’re purging, only 
that ain’t all.” 

Then Angus — Angus — “A spy 



86 



GALAXY 




from Missouri no doubt.” 

“Huh? Oh — yeah. This purge is 
the big one, he said to tell you. We 
better all get out, nothing else to 
do.” 

“What was it about his mother?” 
“She — I druther he told you, 
Demetrios. She’s, like, with them 
people doing the purge. They’re— 
killing the Abramites, in Inner 
City. And some others they don’t 
like. Well, Mister Angus didn’t 
want to risk drawing trouble on 
Mam Estelle, so he’ll be out in the 
woods now, him and the dog, and 
the Professor, and your woman. Me 
and Frankie come here to get the 
layout of this place. Only that one 
old fart minding it tonight?” 

“Only him,” said Bosco, turning 
his head. “Couldn’t help listening. 
It's dead as a tomb here all night 
long. Count on me, boys — I’ll lend 
a hand. Nobody wants out more’n I 
do.” 

“Me and Angus will be back.” 
“And me,” said Frankie. 
“Okay,” said Demetrios to all of 
them, feeling frightened and old, 
and shaken by the miracle of love 
redeemed. “Okay.” 

“After we spring you,’’ said 
Garth, “we join your woman and 
the Professor and Frankie at a 
place I know on the South Road.” 
“No, I come back with you and 
Mister Angus to spring him,” said 
Frankie. His hands jumped from 
the bars. “Hey! Clumsy!” 

“We’ll see. Le’ go my hair, 
Plague.” 



“Balls to we’ll see. You got to 
have the brains of the outfit with 
you. Besides, this is the happenest 
day of my life.” 

“We’ll see, " said Garth, and 
Frankie’s face receded in darkness, 
a candle going out. 

Bosco said: “You really got 
friends.” He spoke with envy. 

“You’ll come with us? We could 
do with another friend.” 

“I’m your man. Where will you 
go, you think?” 

“West — ah, I don’t know. We 
must all decide. I dream of going 
west — and yet it’ll all be under 
water, the places I knew.” 

“Like Gammo’s Ramblers — into 
my head all the time and won’t let 
go. You be an Old-Timer?” 

“Thirteen when the bombs fell. 
Loved one world, feel lost in the 
other. But the old one’s gone. 
Downstream with time.”

Angus the son of Stephen came to

lie Entertainment Facility like any 
tradesman or beggar, and was ad- 
mitted by the girl named Solitaire, 
who saw how grief and anger were 
clawing his heart and chewing his 
vitals, and weariness riding him 
like the black ape, and his own 
great gray hound could not protect 
him. It busies me and worries me — 
the passions always do — / ought to 
be carving cherrystones with the 
Lord’s Prayer, but God, there's no 
living in it. 

“Will he come in then?’’ says 
Solitaire, and he did, into the kit- 
chen where Mam Estelle was sitting 
with some innocent morning tea — 
no corn spirit neither, just her last 
peaceful cup of the day — came in 
with a backward look for the alley 
like a man pursued, and he asked 
for Demetrios, and was told man 
Demetrios had gone to the Town 
Hal! hours since and was not re- 
turned. “ That's bad, " said Angus. 

Solitaire was looking into him, 
she in her slavey’s smock, gray 
smudge on her cheek, turban of 
grubby doth about her hair, and 
she said: “He is scratched with 
brambles. One time Solitaire was 
scratched with brambles and she 
saw a hole in the brook that had no 
bottom, the water ran black out of 
the heart of the earth — will he come 
sit down and rest, himself it is?’’ 
And Angus saw through his own 
pain that she was concerned for 
him in a way that (he thought) no 
one before had ever been con- 
cerned. 



She touched Brand s head. The 
dog whined gently and leaned his 
shoulder against her little thigh, 
too polite to fling up his paws on 
her slenderness. “He likes you,'’ 
said Angus. “Don’t be afraid of 
him or me. " The slavey 's disguise 
was a nothing to be sure, a curtain 
for other people. He looked through 
it. scarce aware of it. discovering 
the heart of strangeness. 

She said: “Solitaire is not afraid. 
Oh. she found lovingkindness here 
a while ago. But what happened to 
hurt him?” 

She could astonish him. Through 
shock and exhaustion after the 
night of violence — after all we 
know, and you might as well also, 
that his mother had bedded Senator 
Pry, the coming man of the hour 
and King Brian 's instrument in the 
purge, which was somewhat like 
pissing on his father’s memory \ and 
for Angus the graciousness of life in 
Inner City had been ripped away 
like the cover from a sewer — 
through his misery’ Angus under- 
stood that Solitaire was asking 
about himself. “Oh. ’" he said. “I 
saw the black waters too. I knew 
they were there, l must have known 
it. ’ ’ 

“Well, “ said Mam Estelle, “sit 
down, sit down. Pull up a chair for 
some tea, and what do you want 
with our man Demetrios?” 

“I must warn him.” Soon they 
had the necessary information out 
of him — his name, his place in the 
crazy world, his meeting with De-

metrics — or I should say that Mam 
Estelle did. for Solitaire asked no 
questions, only moved about watch- 
ing him. now from the light, now 
from the sun-shadow. You might 
have thought her transparent, a 
ghost of smudged beauty blown 
here and there, a captive light 
driven by the turning of a mirror. 

She saw a boy with red-brown 
hair, who wore no white tunic now 
though surely born to it but a gray 
iacket like a workman's, a gray 
loincloth, luxurious sandals. On his 
wrist was a fantastic little watch, 
clearly of Old Time, at his belt a 
leather-sheathed knife; at his back 
he carried no bow nor quiver, but 
one of those long carry-alls — where 
l come from uv call them bac-pacs. 
She saw a face of beauty and 
gravity — boy, man, angel, no need 
to wonder — coming to her out of 
nowhere, in trouble and in need of 
her. 

He saw a girl wearing innocent 
secrets like protective garments; so 
he would always think of her, even 
when secrets were put aside. 

Forgive me if I rush you along so. 

I do promise to fill you in on all the 
Facts that you so clearly have a 
right to know in all their bustling 
factiness. But to me your novelist 
the essential thing is what Mam Es- 
telle saw; that Solitaire was no 
wraith at all but a woman in love. It 
can happen to anyone — pity we are 
so seldom warned. And Mam Es- 
telle saw it had happened to Angus 
at the same time — one of the rarest 



coincidences in this world, in most 
of the worlds l know. 

part of the west you 
VV from, Demetrios?” 

“Missouri. They called it mid- 
west in those days. Have you 
traveled much in that direction?” 

"Not much. Couple years ago I 
got as far as the coast of the Fresh- 
water Sea — that’s what the trappers 
call it; 1 was with a party of them, 
for the season. Our base camp was 
near a puny little settlement called 
Shatawka, goddamn natives. They 
called the Sea Lake Erie and said 
you could drink it. I tried it — try 
anything once — Jasus! Never trust 
a native. Inland though, the brooks 
and springs are pretty fair. It’s bad 
earthquake country. No heavy 
shocks but small ones day after day 
like God or somebody couldn’t quit 
growling to himself. They say one 
day he’ll throw a big one. The 
beaver don’t mind — real thick 
around there and north of there. 
We got silver fox too, and marten — 
of course the damned red rats rob 
your traps all-a-time. Game’s easy 
to get. There was a brown tiger 
scare while we was there — robbed a 
village to the north, but we never 
saw him. I never have seen him, 
wonder sometimes if he’s folk- 
say ...” 

A casual, throaty voice, an inno- 
cent-seeming, blunt, thirtyish face 
in the candlelight — Demetrios 

warmed to him. Himself unsure 
and tense, as if already gone forth

to dare the roads and the wilder- 
ness with diminishing strength and 
no sight of a goal, he found Bosco’s 
talk sustaining. Bosco was no story- 
teller: he knew these things directly 
with his senses and with very little 
imagination — the feel of an enslav- 
ed hand on the oar; the gloom, 
acrid stench, the peril of a mine; 
the stillness of jungle that is no still- 
ness but a teeming of life, a passion 
latent in the overabundance, a 
patience like a serpent’s hot slow 
patience, a waiting that may break 
forth in a roaring or a cry, but only 
for a reason. It made the hour 
pass — 

“I hope to read my title clear 

To mansions in the skies — ” 

“He ever sing anything else?” 

“Not since 1 been here, just them 
two lines. That and his vitamins. 
He’s got like a home here. Putney 
says — ever’ time they turn him 
loose he quick does something dirty 
so to get himself back in. You 
know — nourishing stew, no worries 
except about his vitamins, whatever 
they be. Cell 1 — that’s different. 
They brung that man in late last 
night, flung him there — he couldn’t 
hardly walk. Not a sound out of 
him except breathing for a while. I 
hollered to him and pounded on the 
wall, no good, nor I couldn’t get 
anything out of Putney, just gibber- 
ing. Ha’n’t even heard the breath- 
ing since about the time they brung 
you in. That dish Put took away 



hadn’t been touched. They let 
people die accidental-apurpose, 
here at Nuber?” 

“I never thought so.” What do 
von know about anything, Deme- 
trios, you who filled your mind with 
fancies and farewells while another 
world grew up around you — 
“Maybe it’s just Put. Real 
burrow-cat, that man. The ga in 
there could be dead for days while 
Put waits for the brass to tell him 
what to do. Hark! — ” 

A muffled disturbance in Put- 
ney’s room — in a moment the 
door opened, releasing stronger 
candlelight and a glimpse of Putney 
himself, pop-eyed on his cot, bound 
and gagged. A dog, a boy, and a 
man hurried to the cell door, while 
Garth remained on guard over 
Putney. Angus shoved his stocking 
mask in his gray jacket. Stiff legged 
beside him with lifted hackles. 
Brand studied the dark, sorted the 
smells. “Damn this thing!” Angus 
was struggling with the key. 

“That’n' maybe,” said Frankie 
correctly. Angus flung open the 
door. “Brains of the outfit,” said 
the boy in the mask. 

Angus caught Demetrios in a 
quick embrace. “1 was afraid for 
you. Have they — ” 

“No, nothing bad, I’m all right.” 
Dizziness swirled in him. Whoever 
knows joy or pain in the moment of 
their presence? Only the differing 
intensities of light; later, remem- 
bering, we give them names. “This

is Bosco, who wants to come with 
us. He knows wilderness, and the 
roads, places we never heard of.” 

“Step closer, Bosco, will you? 
I’m nearsighted.” Bosco moved 
into the field of ruthless inspection. 
Angus the polite, confused boy of 
yesterday was surely not gone, but 
merely hidden in Angus the com- 
mander because there was no time 
for him. “All right — good. Come 
with us.” There seemed no ques- 
tion of challenging Angus’ right to 
decide. In this crisis someone must 
be ready with swift rational aye or 
no: let it be Angus, who said that 
power stinks, but who understood 
the exercise of it. 

“I’m in for ripping off a sucking 
pig, Mister.” 

“Maybe I'll ask you to teach me 
how it’s done. Got any left?” 

“Cops got it.” Bosco was looking 
into Cell 1 and as Demetrios was 
about to join him there he muttered 
from his mouth-corner: “Keep the 
kid out of here.” 

The man in Cell 1 sprawled 
naked on the floor, mouth open, 
his clotted wounds untended; his 
chest was motionless, and Deme- 
trious knew him. Demetrios turned 
away and slipped his arm over 
Frankie’s shoulders. “We’ll go talk 
to Garth.” Passing Angus, he indi- 
cated Cell 1 with a motion of his 
eyes. “Holman Shawn.” 

In Putney’s room Garth stood 
watch by the outer door, the eye- 
holes of his mask a blue sparkle. 
"Okay, man Demetrios?” 



“Okay, Garth.” 

“About your dream, my aunt 
said — ” Garth glanced at Putney’s 
flushed listening face. ‘‘Well, 
later.” 

“I want my vitamins. I want my 
vitamins.” 

‘‘You’ll get your vitamins, o’ 
man,” said Bosco’s genial voice. 

“Will I then? God bless you. 

“I hope to read my title clear 
To mansions in the skies — ” 

From the curve of Demetrios’ 
arm Frankie looked up, demanding 
answers. “What was it in t’other 
cell you didn’t want me to see?” 

Demetrios could remember: at 
twelve only a fool doesn’t know that 
the other side of the coin is sorrow; 
and Frankie would never be a fool. 
“A dead man, Frankie. He was an 
Abramite. They left him there after 
a beating, they let it happen.” 
Frankie stared, eyes bottomless; 
the ocean is not concerned with for- 
giveness. “It’s the other side, 
Frankie. The other side of the hap- 
penest day of our lives.”

ways ready with his rusty’, trusty, 
snaggletooth hacksaw. 

— DEMETRIOS. 



A mist often rises from the ground 
L in the nights at Nuber, flowing 
about the houses, which stand 
lonely — houses always do: islands 
that people have shoveled together 
for resting-places of the journey. 
The mist absorbs the earth-loving 
touch of footsteps, the sound of 
laughter under the breath, whis- 
pered love and courage. The mist is 
ambiguity and marvel. One 
breathes it in as vapor and be- 
comes — let us say, wiser: at least a 
blurred wisdom is to be found in 
the fog, an ability to say what might 
never be said in daylight or under 
the extravagant invitations of the 
moon. 

Along alleys and avenues where 
even the trees were drowsing, the 
ground mist joined a vapor that 
rolled in through an eastern gap in 
the hills. Night smelled of salt air, 
of wild ocean loneliness. Fog 
yielded sometimes to persuasion of 
a late candle in a window, or 
thinned to reveal the thrust of a 
building’s corner, a hitching post, a 
front yard fence. In all this passage 
Garth and Frankie were the guides. 
To Demetrios they conveyed an in- 
timation of the medieval; their ash 
bows and quivers were part of 
them, practical as any 20th Century 
soldier’s rifle. Both knew every 
turning as a fox knows his own hill- 



side, knew every step from the sad 
shack where they had been born, in 
the shadow of King Brian’s Wall, 
to the Great South Road. That sec- 
tion where the Meadows end, allow- 
ing the city to heave up against the 
Wall, is called Outer Wall Street; 
some of the shacks lean three-sided 
against the mass itself, and rain 
trickles through the haphazard 
joining. The boys’ father, when he 
worked, was a street-scavenger, 
selling the manure to farmers at 
starveling prices. 

Demetrios walked behind, now 
and then touching their shirts or 
hip satchels for comfort. The wal- 
nut stick satisfied his right hand. 
Behind him came Angus, Brand, 
and Bos co. 

“Nave we far to go tonight?” 
Having spoken, Demetrios was dis- 
gusted by that elderly querulous 
noise from his throat. Angus could 
not have slept at all during the past 
night, when the purge began; he 
would have been traversing the rim 
of hell while Demetrios lay with 
Solitaire and the Professor snug in 
bed. 

“Not far, Demetrios.” Angus 
spoke gently. “We thought, when 
we’ve joined the others we’ll go on 
to the hant-house off the South 
Road and rest there, till first-light 
anyway. I hear nobody goes near it 
for fear of getting bespooked.” 

“Good enough.” 

“We mustn’t stay there long, 
Mister Angus,” said Garth. “They 
could set hounds on Demetrios’ 



92 



GALAXY 




trail, or yours, the way dogs won’t 
usu’ly stop for spooks, nor men 
won’t by daylight maybe.” 

‘‘There are even some in Inner 
City who don’t believe in’em.” The 
undercurrent in Angus’ voice was 
not all amusement. ‘‘Like me.” 

“Aye-so?” Garth’s voice was 
troubled, the trouble echoed by an 
uncertain throat-noise from Bosco 
back there in the dark — not so deep 
a dark: a moon was exerting power 
above the mist, so that the travelers 
might feel like swimmers rising to 
the surface into new dimensions of 
breath and motion. ‘‘Man Deme- 
trios, my aunt asked the book 
about your dream. It said the rail- 
road was a dream-speech — see, 
that’s the science of the — the sub- 
conscience, and the real road is 
going to go over water for sure on a 
long journey. The book did say 
that, each time she let it fall open, 
and she read it right out to me — 
that is, I don’t mean read, but any- 
how she knowed that was what it 
like meant.” 

‘‘My thanks to her,” said Deme- 
trios, remembering the age of 
science. For more than a century it 
had been able to hold in check, 
somewhat, the human compulsion 
to accept the dithering of primitive 
magic as revelation and mystic 
truth. It could not teach its method 
of approach except to the very 
few — (how hard did it try? — Deme- 
trios wasn’t sure); nor could it sup- 
press the corruption generated by 
the gifts that science itself had 



tossed to fools possessed of power — 
how hard did it try? By the time 
computers were being employed in 
the commercial development of as- 
trology, tarot, witchcraft, all the 
rest of the dreary sludge — by that 
time, long before 1993, maybe we 
were already done for. ‘‘We shall 
cross water,” said Demetrios, ‘‘and 
grow older.” He hoped that Garth’s 
love-sensitive ear would not catch 
the sarcasm and anger that had 
threatened to erupt through his 
words like a belch from an acid 
stomach. 

Garth is kind, lovable, good. 
Didn 't he just help me get out of a 
stinking jail? When was I appoint- 
ed to turn him into a 20th Century 
rationalist, in an age that hates rea- 
son, supposing / knew how it could 
be done? All the same — 

What is there to hope j or? What 
can we do? Accept the new dark 
age as inevitable in the rhythm of 
history'? 

Periods of special enlightenment 
do tend to be short — Greece, the 
European Renaissance — and then 
the poor startled human race must 
go pottering back into the cave to 
digest. False analogies: the human 
race is not a person, and jorget- 
fulness is hardly digestion. 

So — we hope, we make believe 
that reason can somehow nourish 
light in private places, through 
more long dismal centuries when 
nothing is certain except the power 
of unreason? What else? 

The moonlight explaining the

face of Frankie grew tender. 

Why, damn it. Garth is teach- 
able. as teachable as Frankie, or 
Angus. What if l AM appointed? 
Self -appointed — it’s for me to say. 
Sort out your own brains first. 
Demetrios: beginning now. 

“This’ll be the South Road,” 
said Garth. The mist, no higher 
than their knees, ran as a river of 
silent whiteness channeled between 
walls of maple and evergreen and 
oak, and the blue-black summits of 
leaves were sprinkled and sparkling 
with stars. 

Men wanted those: dreamed of 
approaching them. They did reach 
the moon and Mars: they did send 
astounding gadgets to the wastes of 
Venus, Mercury, Jupiter to listen 
and scan and crackle reports back 
to the home planet where they were 
playing with tarot cards and nerve 
gas and leaky nuclear toys. 

Axiom in man-made ethics: 
Human beings choose their own 
purposes, according to whatever 
complex of desire and information 
dominates their thinking. Corol- 
lary The purposes will be good (by 
whatever standard of “ good " is 
being employed) in so far as the de- 
sire is good and the information 
sound. Conclusion (one of many): 
An old man possessed of relatively 
trustworthy information cannot be 
lightly excused from the obligation 
to teach . Define “trustworthy”. 
Define “ obligation ” . Oh. I am 
bumbling. 

I am getting old . 



T he ventriloquial laughter-like 
noise of a screech-owl trilled out 
of milky obscurity ahead of them at 
the side of the road, two calls close 
together. The sound was im- 
mediately answered — from all 
around him, it seemed to Deme- 
trios, but he saw Frankie’s lips in 
slight motion, and then the 
strengthening half-moon displayed 
the bounty of Frankie’s grin. He 
whispered: “Solitaire did that?” 
“Learnt her this afternoon,” said 
Frankie. “(Brains of the outfit.)” 
He called softly: “Everything’s 

okay. It’s us.” 

A three-bodied shadow emerged, 
into the mist that seemed about to 
dissolve yet never did, quite, as 
though something of it — a softness, 
a blurring of vision like the myopia 
of Angus Bridgeman or the hesita- 
tions of Demetrios, would always 
accompany the travelers, quieting 
the human lust for certainties — and 
became three separate souls, carry- 
ing small packs, daring night and 
wilderness, young and not young. 
Here was small sweet Solitaire, and 
the Professor carrying his lute 
close-wrapped against the damp- 
ness; a thicker, heavier shape turn- 
ed to the moon the watchful face of 
Babette. 

Angus spoke under his breath. 
"You know these friends. Brand.” 
Brand lowered his ears, trotting 
forward smoke-silent. Solitaire 
reached, to speak to him with her 
hand. The company was eight. 

“O Demetrios!” Solitaire did not 



94 



GALAXY 




kiss him. She pressed her face on 
his chest and held him fast, making 
his lank body a refuge. “Demetrios, 
Dcmetrios, sacred to the earth.” 

‘‘My name — you knew that, 
love?” 

‘‘Demetrios forgets what he’s 
told her. Solitaire never forgets any- 
thing.” Frankie and Garth watched 
the road in both directions — no one 
ever travels the roads at night, even 
the Great South Road: almost no 
one; no one respectable. “Solitaire 
has a thing to tell — not now — 
soon — some time. Demetrios will 
make a happiness out of it, could 
be. Solitaire wants to carry a stick 
like Demetrios. The Professor is 
thinking somebody will cut a stick 
for Solitaire to carry.” 

“Somebody better,” said Bab- 
ette. “Man Demetrios, bless you, I 
only come to see you on your way, 
then I got to go back to my Mam, 
the way she wouldn’t last three days 
without me.” 

The company was, in a way, 
seven. But more than that still, for 
one of the amazing aspects of love 
is the traffic it carries on with 
memory — now I know this for true. 
I who write this book, for once 
upon a time an ancient man, I be- 
in q then not much bigger than a 
tJv-speck. took me on his lap and 
said: "Here's a howdy- do! What's a 
howdv-do? A howdy-do's a little 
one. a howdy-do's a pretty one. and 
here's a howdy-do!" I reached and 
qot me a list fid of white beard with 
a kiss in it. Now the love of my 



father and mother and some others 
had surrounded me the way the sea 
moves in perfection around a little 
fish, but in that moment with 
Whitebeard — (/ haven't a notion 
who he was. never did know ) — / 
discovered how the universe holds 
separate beings who can open their 
own countries of love to let you in a 
while. So Whitebeard goes with me; 
but those l couldn't like — why, / 
treat'em hatefully: l forget’ cm. 

Demetrios would carry Babette in 
himself the whole way, whatever 
that way was (even now wondering, 
Shall I ever see her again after to- 
night?) — her broad bosom, her 
cheerful directness, round face, 
open smile. 

Angus asked: “May I borrow the 
hatchet?” 

“For sure,” said Garth, watch- 
ing the road. “Any time. Mister 
Angus, yourself it is. Frankie — ?” 

Frankie unslung from his belt 
the small camp-ax of Old Time. He 
removed the leather guard, and the 
blade's edge became under the 
moon an arc of fierce frost. It was 
evident, in the language of 
Frankie’s hands, that to him the 
care of the Hatchet was a most holy 
trust; also that he did not under- 
stand why Mister Angus and not 
himself or Garth should make use 
of it. 

“Man Garth,” said Angus, “let 
it be Mister Angus no more. I have 
no place in the Inner City nor want 
none, nor any place I know of at all 
except in this company.” 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY 



95 




Garth watched the road. “Aye- 
30 , Angus. Try the oak yonder, 
where it leans out a branch.” 
Frankie set the Hatchet in Angus’ 
hand, and went with him, pulling 
down the branch for Angus to cut, 
staying close at his side while 
Angus trimmed it with a natural 
bend for a handle, and then re- 
turned the Hatchet. 

Then Frankie must rub the edge 
of it with his shirt. “That Hatchet,” 
said Angus, “has had good care.” 
Frankie nodded, speechless, find- 
ing it no occasion for a grin, only 
for a different sort of smile that 
glowed and vanished in the white 
light. Angus brought the stick to 
Solitaire. She moved out of Deme- 
trios’ arms to take it and weigh it in 
her hand. “It’s green,” said Angus. 
“It will ripen.” 

“Everything does,” she said. 
“The stones, and the stars. Now 
Solitaire can lean on a staff if she’s 
tired or lazy or cross.” 

“We must get on,” said Garth. 
“Frankie, watch with me for the 
wood-road to the hant-house. I 
might miss it.” 

“The white stone, remember?” 
But when the Company had moved 
on a few hundred slow paces along 
the open misty channel of the South 
Road, it was Frankie who said: 
“There it be. Leave me take front, 
the way I see best in the dark. You 
link up one and one behind.” 

“It’s more’n an hour you ha’n’t 
called me Clunk.” 

Many moments later (not a 



measurable time) as the Company 
moved ahead through what was for 
Demetrios a tunnel of unbroken 
darkness, his finger hooked in 
Garth’s belt. Solitaire’s in his, the 
other links a chain of nerves that 
made them (for a while) one body, 
Frankie’s small treble reached 
Demetrios: “It’ll be never again 
you call me Plague.” Then some- 
times Frankie’s voice was warning, 
clear enough so that Bosco at the 
end of the line would hear it: “Stick 
in the path crossways.” Or: 
“Briers, briers.” Or: “Fallen log, 
don’t nobody tumble.” Then at last 
(clearly not a measurable time): 
“Brains of the outfit sees moonlight 
ahead — ” at which a fleet ripple of 
laughter ran through the Company, 
since Frankie himself had sent the 
remark down the line with a 
chuckle in it. 



E ntering the pallid clearing be- 
hind Garth and Frankie, Deme- 
trios did not immediately see the 
hant-house, for it crouched at the 
darkest edge of the moonlit space 
where the forest had flung around 
it wanton arms of wild grape, and 
pushed through its front courtyard 
the shaft of a pine now twice the 
height of the building, but could 
not quite capture the ancient 
thing — not altogether, not yet. His 
eyes discovered a splash of moon- 
light on a surface of slate that 
nature had never arranged, and 
three eyes of glassless windows 



96 



GALAXY 




above the mute scream of a door- 
less doorway. Garth said reflective- 
ly: “It’s them stone floors inside. 
Been no place for seeds to find a 
crack, or they’d ‘a’ done it like that 
pine wherever a mite of sun come 
through.” 

“Colonial?” said Demetrios. “By 
God I think so. I never knew it was 
here. I could have dreamed a story 
for it.” 

“No reason to know,” said 
Garth. “We’re more’n a mile from 
the South Road now and nobody 
comes here. What’s Colonial?” 

“Old Old-Time, before the — call 
it the age of marvels. This house 
may have -been erected more than 
three hundred years ago.” 

“There’s Colonial house in the 
Inner City,” said Angus. “It’s been 
kept in repair. They call it the 
Dutch Museum.” 

“Dutch,” said Bosco — “that was 
another name for them bloody 
Injans. Nay, I seen an old house at 
Albany, I think they called it Co- 
lonial, only the gov’ment don’t let 
you go into it.” 

Solitaire shivered in the crook of 
Demetrios’ arm; Babette had made 
the sign of the Wheel. “Ah, they 
were all just people,” said Deme- 
trios, “and long gone; and this is 
just a building that didn’t fall apart 
easily.” A barn owl blurted his call 
and came Boating out of an upper 
window to carry a shadow across 
the moon. “How good are the walls, 
Garth?” 

“Good — stone. With what’s left 



of a wood and plaster finish onto 
the inside, only people must’ve took 
to stealing bits and pieces till there 
a’n’t much left. Roof slates too, 
they be near-about gone at the 
back — nay, Frankie, don’t!” — for 
Frankie had swaggered near the 
black doorway and was talking like 
an owl: “You who hoo-hoo! Any- 
body to ho-huh-home?” At Garth’s 
protest he demanded: “A’n’t we 
going in?” 

The hant-house stood calm in its 
three hundred years. They heard 
aeolian murmurs, a rustling of 
whatever modest life had chosen in 
this century to make a home here. 
The Professor joined Frankie pro- 
tectively by the doorway. Bosco was 
grumbling: “We got anything for 
lights? I wouldn’t mind the place 
with a bit of light.” 

“Got some pine torches and 
carrier in my pack,” said Garth. 

“Solitaire could light one,” said 
Solitaire. 

“All right.” All of them includ- 
ing himself, Demetrios realized, 
had been waiting on that approval 
from Angus. In the shelter of 
Angus’ spread jacket Solitaire won 
a flame from her tinder-box. Two 
golden faces confronted one an- 
other on their own island of light. 
So deeply tranced was Solitaire in 
her discoveries that Garth must 
touch her hand, reminding her of 
the torch he held waiting. 

These are good inventions in 
their way, pine sticks with a tight 
binding of rag sometimes impreg- 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY

nated with pine oil — turpentine if 
you insist. The stick is whittled so it 
may be inserted in a slotted device 
like a candlestick, which can be 
stuck in the ground or in a wall- 
bracket; around the slot is a guard 
like the hilt of a rapier, intended to 
protect the carrying hand. A good 
torch will burn prettily and rather 
calmly for quite a while. The age of 
electricity could easily have mass- 
produced these foodiddles for sale 
as antiques, but history says that to 
its everlasting loss it didn’t — some- 
thing about fire underwriters. 

Garth held up his good torch. 
The Company followed him into 
the quiet place.

if I can teach you to be patient — 

Those very ones who believe 
that everything has been said 
and done, will greet you as new 
and yet will close the door be- 
hind you. And then they will say 
again that everything has been 
and done. — Eugene Delacroix, 
JOURNAL. 1824. 



G arth’s pine torch, its bracket 
wedged into a firedog of the 
hearth, shone on the face of Angus, 
who sat with Brand stretched out 
beside him. Demetrios watched 
that dear image with drowsing eyes. 
What of the poison of jealousy, the 
making of demands, the sin of pos- 



sessiveness? Surely an old man 
might keep his heart clear of those 
follies, at least among these gentle 
few. Must grief inevitably burn be- 
cause there is one who loves and 
one who is loved? One compen- 
sates. For Angus and Solitaire it 
was a little different: for a time they 
would be caught in the same fever. 
He remembered how something 
like this had once glowed for him 
and Elizabeth of Hartford, and 
might still hold warmth if she had 
not died. Death had blown it away, 
and now he found he could not 
quite recall the color of her eyes. 

The Professor’s lute sent ques- 
tions into cobwebbed corners, driv- 
ing out echoes to play hide-and- 
seek. The small torch opened the 
ceiling of the big room to in- 
finity. Solitaire sat by Demetrios on 
their blanket, and Babette was 
cross-legged on his other side, her 
plump shadow dancing on the wall 
with the shadows of Angus and 
Solitaire; Demetrios could see her 
broad kind face if he turned his 
head. He was going to miss her, if 
they went west through the wilder- 
ness. He would miss Mam Estelle, 
the girls, even Nuber itself, having 
consigned forty-seven years of his 
life to the peculiar place. 

Bosco, ready to grab comfort 
anywhere, had rolled up in Garth’s 
blanket while Garth and Frankie 
took first watch. After it Angus and 
Bosco would watch until first-light, 
and then, Angus had suggested, 
they might as well follow a wood- 



98 



GALAXY 




road that wound southwest from 
the hant-house, paralleling the 
Great South Road in its beginning. 
The South Road itself would ,be un- 
safe for fugitives, up to the border 
of Katskil. Garth and Frankie had 
once tried that wood-road for a 
mile, running away from home. 
Their mother was still living then: 
love and conscience drove them 
back. 

Before the last Bower of the torch 
had fallen Demetrios entered sleep. 
Westward chugged the homely lo- 
comotive. the woodburner with 
bulging stack, westward past 
Aberedo, clattering, coughing dirt. 
It halted at a water-tower, where a 
man with Abel Kane embroidered 
on his overalls warned the engine- 
driver: “Careful, man, the water 
shortage is terrible. Thing is They 
got to cover the earth with it, and 
that don’t leave much. Can’t turn 
back the clock to Noah, no sir. 
Likely won’t nobody know where 
he’s at till They’ve done the — uh — 
hydraulic finalizing.” 

(/ vour novelist know quite well 
where I'm at. My problem is to 
know where I’m at n’t.) 

The woman with the market- 
basket leaned across Demetrios to 
ask a deaf farmer: “What’d the 
man say?” A sad little girl with ade- 
noids and a goiter in the seat op- 
posite watched with never a smile. 
Demetrios replied for the deaf 
man, or wanted to: “We’re going to 



Hesterville to see the Water Short- 
age.” She wasn’t listening. The sad 
child’s mother stared through 
Demetrios with dislike. But here al- 
ready was Hesterville — All out for 
Hestervi-i-lle! 

No way out except down into flat 
green water, down and down, since 
the station loomed there below. 
The train puffed along an embank- 
ment, the passengers floated out 
and down like Demetrios, off the 
open carriage with the wicker 
seats — open air, smoky air, lost 
air — into green water deep and 
slow. White shapes stood tranquil 
in green water-air; darker shapes 
roved up with unknown intent — we 
all live in darkness, don’t we? — and 
in gross darkness the people — 

££ w^emetrios.” Solitaire spoke 
I w gently. “Demetrios made 
noises.” She rubbed his forehead 
softly, a service she had done before 
when nightmare trod on him. Con- 
fusion drained away. The silly 
dream was a face gone in a crowd. 
Ambiguous light was entering the 
hant-house* whether from dawn or 
a descending moon he could not 
tell. The face of Angus he could not 
lind. Where it had been a scar in 
the wall appeared: plaster had 
fallen from lath in a patch the 
shape of North America, and in 
front of this hung a spider, a good 
gray scavenging citizen nursing her 
drop of poison and her own torch of 
life. Frankie was lying with his 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY

head in Solitaire’s lap, looking in 
sleep more like nine years old than 
twelve. “Angus and Bosco K 
watching outside.’’ 

“Is it moonlight?” 

“No, day begins. A bird called. 
Talk soft so Love can sleep. 

“Redbird it were,” said Babette, 
her voice as low as Solitaire’s in awe 
of Frankie’s slumber. “lean see my 
way home soon spite of fog.” 
“Can’t come with us? — nay, I 
know. The Mam needs you.” 
“Wouldn’t last a day and me not 
there. Will 1 tell her you’ll come 
back? — oyah, of course 1 will, I 
mean, will there be truth in it?” 
“How can I say? Do old men ever 
come back?” 

“Shame on you, Dimmy!” said 
Babette, and shook him. “Shame 
on you for a gloomer! Come on, 
come out of the bad dreams!” 
Demetrios sat up, accepting the 
morning chill. “Yes — yes, we must 
find a place where they don’t re- 
quire a license for storytelling.” 
Light was showing him the shape of 
the ancient structure, once maybe a 
reception room for gentry in wigs 
and knee breeches. A stairway 
curve broke into darkness short of 
the second floor; the upper landing 
had dropped, likely decayed by 
years of leakage from the roof. A 
heap of plaster and rotted wood lay 
below the break. “We must look 
for a place where things can be 
made better without making them 
worse.” 

Solitaire’s fingertips spoke love 



to Frankie’s curls, not waking him. 
He moved, a vague thrust of hips 
against the blanket, and quieted, 
his parted mouth a poem of Eros. 
“Solitaire has a thing to tell . 
Solitaire is pregnant.” 

“Oh—” 

“By Demetrios,” she said, smil- 
ing at him in the growing light. 
“She planned it. She knows her 
calendar.” The lute chuckled from 
a shadowed place. “For a month 
she and Professor only played 
games outside the door. Paesan is 
saying he planned it with her. So 
there’d be seed of Demetrios.” 

Elizabeth of Hartford, her wast- 
ed agony, the horror of the birth 
and double death — yet there was 
that half-chance, that bloodless 
statistical encouragement: Eliza- 

beth’s own genes might have been 
the ones to carry the 20th Century 
damnation. Most births are still 
normal — three out of Jive, isn’t that 
what they say? — when they occur at 
all — otherwise who would try to 
prolong the days before extinction? 
“Solitaire — my love Solitaire — two 
months? Three?” 

“Nearer three,” said Solitaire 
with pride. 

“We’ll get out of Katskil, settle 
in a safe place to wait your time.” 
Safe place ! — where is that? “Bab- 
ette, stay away from the Abramites. 
At Town Hall I was questioned 
about Abramites at Mam Estelle’s. 
Told’em nothing of course. Fran 
ought to get out of town.” 

“Leave it to me. Don’t worry?"

She added quaint Old-Time words 
that folk still deprecatingly used: 
“Do your own thing, Dimmy.” 
Angus came in with light around 
him, rousing Garth, kneeling by 
Frankie and Solitaire, silently ask- 
ing: Is it well with us? It was the 
how-boy blind with sleep whose 
shoulder he kissed, Frankie whose 
hair he rudely rumpled, Demetrios 
of whom he asked gently: “Shall we 
go by the wood-road?” 

Solitaire kindled a small fire in 
the hearth, where Babette toasted 
bread and bacon. She had brought 
along other more practical food to 
start the journey — dried corn and 
Iruit, smoked meat, hard meal- 
cakes, a flask of wine. Angus had 
money with him; Garth and Bosco 
and Frankie claimed skill at hunt- 
ing and fishing. All the same Bab- 
ette cried a little, watching them 
go, in the morning fog that was 
both confusion and a shelter, down 
that road which might turn in any 
direction, maybe toward nowhere. 
She watched them go — sharp-eyed 
Garth and Frankie, her old weird 
Demetrios, sweet mad Solitaire 
with her branch of oak gaily 
mimicking the old man’s staff — in- 
deed she, with maybe the most to 
lose, seemed to be the happiest to 
be going; (but how old was Soli- 
taire, really? — Babette had never 
lelt sure) — and dark-browned An- 
gus with the gray hound who was 
more like a part of himself than a 
servant, and the massive soft-footed 
stranger Bosco who — Babette con- 



sidered him tricky: his watchful 
face was telling nothing of his in- 
ward life. Babette watched them 
go, gave her nose a last wipe on the 
back of her arm, disconsolately 
plodded back to her share of the 
work of the world. 

( But much later she rejoined us, 
as I will tell if I can teach you to he 
patient with me.) 

[Saturday, July 20] 

S o they went off into the Fog, 
Babette says, about sun-up, 
and from what The Boy told us 
when he come here in Trouble, I 
better not write what way they 
went, nor his name neither. People 
might come and try to read my

straight at him, and got hurt some 
in the Head, I mean my Trucker 
did, but got out and walked away 
from it, froze fish all over the Road. 
We was together a few days, walk- 
ing west because he said he had 
people to Rochester and what's the 
difference, anything to be on the 
move. When he wanted it he would 
pull me down side of the Road and 
do it no matter somebody might go 
by, I didn't care either, I'd just 
keep still looking at the sky till he 
finished, all as he ever wanted was 
On and Off. He found food for me, 
and fought off a couple-three Gunes 
that wanted to Share the Wealth. 
In Beacon they shot him for loot- 
ing. I crossed the River in a Motor- 
boat with some Crazies that thought 
it was the Sea of Galilee and they'd 
see the Savior walking onto it, they 
wrecked the Boat landing in a Rain- 
storm and went off north ways with 



their Ass dragging. I’d had it with 
them, up to here. 

I say I won 't write about a Thing, 
right off I go to doing it. Anyhow l 
come to Nuber chancelike, not car- 
ing. Already the Founders had got 
the Place in order, a regular Camp 
with Officers to tell People where to 
go, what to do. You can always feel 
the Difference when People got 
something to work on, not just 
flopping around like Crazies on the 
Sea of Galilee. Mister Fleur he was 
one of those Officers, working di- 
rect under Simon B ridgeman. / 
helped with refugees, the Hot Soup 
and Bandages bit, and in a couple - 
three months when Bridgeman’s 
Goverment wanted tostablish some 
sex- houses. Mister Fleur's was the 
first. Mister Fleur used to say his 
friend Simon was the only Savior of 
Mankind that ever noticed his 
People had Balls. 

The Sex- house had boys, and 
some way-outs of various kinds. 
Simon B ridgeman, and his Word 
was the same as God's in Nuber, 
allowed all sex was good so long as 
nobody was getting damaged. Most 
people had come to feel that way in 
those days, we did in Raeford, only 
I guess the other kind of idears 
went on as usual too, lately I been 
watching Nuber get more sick-ass 
prudish year by year. Most of all 
Mister Fleur wanted to make sure 
everything was clean, even the 
towels. I heard tell he'd been a 
Doctor before the Crash, though I 
never heard it from him, he never

talked much about Past Time. 
While I was doing the Hot Soup 
Thing, I must of caught his eye, be- 
cause he come over and asked me, 
" Will you fuck for a living, my 
Honey?" And I said, “ Why not?” 

Mister Fleur was kind to me, and 
a Friend too. He didn't want 
women but he liked them. Maybe 
it’s easier to like them if you don't. 
He'd say things like it wasn't too 
bad of an Idear to have two Sexes 
because it made for interesting 
Arguments that People would never 
have to settle because they couldn t. 
1) sometimes talks kind of like 
Mister Fleur, account of Both was 
Educated. 

Mister Fleur was a little sparrowy 
man. shorter than me but I had a 
great Respect for him, and he said I 
had a Good Business Head and a 
Sense of Order. Once-twice Eve 
seen him pull the Switchblade he 
always carried to keep Peace in the 
House, but I never did see him 
obliged to use it. People got the 
Message right off and simmered 
down. 

When Simon B ridgeman was 
murdered I thought it might have 
n earn bout done for Mister Fleur. 
He was Tore Up. He might laugh 
some at B ridgeman s I dears, and 
criticize, but nobody else better, 
they was Friends and I guess he 
really thought S. Bridgeman was 
God. which I never noticed him 
thinking that about anybody else. 
He went on a two- week Drunk. 
Afterward he was like beat out. 



gone slack inside. He said the 
World wasn’t worth a Packet of 
Shit — Present Company excepted 
of course, he was always Polite. 
Well, he straightened out after- 
while, but wasn't never again like 
when Bridgeman was living. 

Sometimes he wanted to get me 
talking about the customers Fd ser- 
viced. He’d laugh, it would give 
him some kind of High, not the 
Thing itself but hearing me talk 
about it. I didn't mind. 

ft went on like that several years. 
Mister Fleur kept things Nice. 
People would come to us uptight — 
you’d be surprised how often the 
Y ticks don’t want to do nothing but 
talk and maybe collect some Sym- 
pathy about Things they can't 
change like wives and so forth and 
likely wouldn't if they could. They'd 
go away feeling better, anyhow 
quieter. Mister Fleur would say 
things like how Idealistic it was to 
work for a Public Utility that was 
actually in the Public Interest. 

In Year 11 smallpox hit Nuber. I 
suppose somebody brang it in from 
Outside. Mister Fleur said all Bad 
Things come from Outside, the In- 
side is always Sinless like Desert 
Islands. I don't know all what he 
meant. Two of our girls died, and a 
Boy that Mister Fleur loved special 
come through the Sickness with his 
face looking for ever- after like a 
cheese-grater — and couldn't stand 
it neither but ran away from us, out 
of Nuber likely, for Mister Fleur 
broke his heart trying to find him 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY 



103 




and never could. Mister Fleur said 
once that condemning the Human 
Race was perfectly all right only too 
fucking hard on Individuals. Dur- 
ing that Smallpox he went away a 
lot into the City helping care for the 
sick and seeing them die. I guess 
he'd been a Doctor all right in Old 
Time though he never would say. 
and anytime he had to give his 
name he'd straighten right up to his 
five foot two and say. “I am Mis- ter 
Fleur. " making the Mister sound 
like ice tinkling the edge of a glass. 

After the Smallpox was over you 
could see how Old Time was riding 
Mister Fleur more than ever — it 
was always on his mind, but worse 
after that, and the Boy Shawn that 
ran away. well, that was a Knife 
into him he couldn't ever pull out. 
He didn't want me to Talk any 
more about the Customers, but he's 
ask me Things about Raeford, and 
Sam and Stevie and Leda, and 
sometimes about Marcus. He'd sit 
by me whiles / talked, and pet me if 
I got to crying. Then one night he 
told me he'd fixed his Will so as I 
was to have the House if anything 
was to happen to him, I only had to 
go to the Town Hall the way it was 
all on record, no trouble, and he 
would appreciate it if I would keep 
the small room he slept in the way it 
was, with the pictures Shawn paint- 
ed. and not use it for the custo- 
mers, and of course I said I would 
and always have, the pictures are 
kind of Weird. One is a great stud 
horse like climbing a rainbow that 



Shawn painted him all purple and 
yellow, you can't think how a Horse 
would get to look like That. Once I 
showed Demetrios that room, and 
he said, "God Almighty, Stell, what 
became of the Boy?" All's I could 
tell him was, he went away, we 
couldn 't ever find him. 

So Mister Fleur said that about 
the Will, and then he said I had a 
Good Head, and I wasn’t to cry any 
more about Marcus because that 
was the kind of cry that did me no 
Good and I must make it like the 
Scar on my Leg — well, Jesus God, 
vou can't do that, but he meant it 
kind. He went off to bed Peaceful, I 
remember, without no Drink in 
him. Come morning we found he'd 
gone to bed perfectly natural and 
then rammed the Switchblade in 
under his ribs. 

He wasn 't old, nor Sick or any- 
thing. / don't Understand how a 
Person could do that no matter how 
Things hurt — I suppose it gets to be 
like not caring, maybe, but 
wouldn 't they always want to know 
what happens Next? 

all day the wood-road led the 
Company south and south- 
west, in a prodigious quiet for 
which Demetrios’ ears were not 
ready. At Nuber, even in the slack 
dead of night, one heard at least a 
contracting of house timbers, rustle 
of mice, drop of spent coals in a 
fireplace, dog or cat noises, a mur- 
mur, a footstep; by day the con- 
tinual street sounds — wagon 



104 



GALAXY 




wheels, clop of hoofs, bray of don- 
keys, peddlers’ cries. Here, not 
even wind. All day the fog never 
Iruly lifted, merely thinning to 
admit watery light and a sufficieht 
view of the road. At the noontime 
halt — the Company sensed rather 
than saw that the sun was over- 
head — Demetrios asked Bosco if 
wilderness always imposed this 
quiet. “My ignorance shames me,’’ 
Demetrios said. “No wilderness 
existed in Old Time except very far 
IVoni the places I knew, and then I 
was spending all my time in Nuber, 
that hot-house, while wilderness 
grew back around us and all I knew 
of it was folk-say.” 

“Where there’s a road,” said 
Bosco, “even a wispy one like this, 
it a’n’t wilderness exactly. Real 
wilderness, you work from tree to 
tree, and remember your back 
trail. Some kinds of jungle, like 
western Moha near the Ontara, you 
got to cut your way. I don’t under- 
stand this road myself. Never seen a 
woods road go this long without 
getting no place. Nor like you say, 
this quiet. There’d ought to be 
animal sounds, not just them birds 
now and then. I believe it’s the fog, 
and the ’umidity. Our sweat smells, 
see, and the critters catch it and 
keep still. Like everything was 
afraid of man, a’n’t it strange?” 

“Funny deer-tracks back-along,” 
said Frankie. 

Bosco tolerantly regarded him 
and his brother. “Wa’n’t deer- 
tracks, Frankie. Them was boar. 



and a big feller.” Sitting weary be- 
tween Angus and the Professor, 
Solitaire shivered; she could not 
have done this much walking in a 
whole day since the time when 
Demetrios found her, and her first 
enthusiasm had dimmed in fatigue; 
Bosco saw it. “Not to worrit,” he 
said. “Boar a’n’t likely to bother 
you unless he thinks you’re hurting 
him, or you go crashing into some 
place he figures is his’n. Besides, 
them sign was made yesterday.” 

Angus nodded, watching her. 
“Brand wasn’t interested. He 
would have been hot for work if the 
smell had been fresh, in spite of 
picking up that rabbit for breakfast 
this morning.” 

“The little thing.” Yet Solitaire’s 
hand moved in affection over 
Brand’s ferocious head. 

“He must kill to live,” said 
Angus, in futile distress because 
the world could not harmonize with 
what he saw of this woman’s 
nature. 

“Solitaire knows that,” she said. 
“People too. Meat is good. Beasts 
all, all beasts,” said Solitaire; and 
hearing her small, disturbed laugh, 
Demetrios dreaded the next mo- 
ments, for she would be weeping 
uncontrollably, almost silently, her 
hands palms upward in her lap as if 
waiting for alms that no one knew 
how to give. 

The Professor heard that laugh 
too, and before the flood of tears 
began he took her lightly in his 
arms as anyone might take a child

in trouble. Angus stared at Deme- 
trios in amazed distress. But words 
could not be used while her trouble 
was on her, and if he went aside 
with Angus to explain how this 
would pass, how it was a thing one 
accepted if one accepted Solitaire, 
she would see them go, and a rage 
might follow. For she had her rages 
too, though no one was ever hurt by 
them except in spirit: would Angus 
still worship after witnessing one of 
those? 

Garth and Bosco were looking 
away in heavy embarrassment, but 
Frankie, after his first moment of 
alarm, searched rapidly in his hip 
satchel. He brought out a fragment 
of admirable carving — it was apple- 
wood, Demetrios thought. A fawn 
lay curled like a sleeping kitten but 
with open eyes. The treasure was no 
bigger than that Japanese netsuke 
of a laughing old woman which had 
been one of the marvels on the desk 
of Dr. Isaac Freeman, very long 
since. Frankie laid the fawn on 
Solitaire’s open palm. “Garth done 
it,’’ he said. “You might like to 
look at it. I a’n’t no good at them 
things myself.” 

The tears stopped, the fingers 
closed. “Frankie — O the eyes of 
him!” 

“You can keep it if you want,” 
said Frankie. “I got about a thou- 
sand more. He does’em all the 
time, my brother does . .” 

I n early evening the Company 
reached a spot where the wood- 



road touched the remnant of an 
Old-Time paved surface, the kind 
the ancients called blacktop. Dimly 
beyond the junction the wood-road 
continued. The Old-Time road was 
so desolate, so far from any sense of 
intelligent creation, it seemed less 
like evidence of humanity than the 
trail they had been following. On 
that they could at least find, though 
intermittently, the dint of wagon- 
wheels gone by a week or two be- 
fore, but the Old-Time road offered 
no more than a long vanishing aisle 
under dense growth, a surface of 
black dull patches nearly hidden by 
grass and weeds that had pressed 
through tiny cracks, started by 
frost or earthquake or time, and 
made them big. Here and there 
seedling trees were pushing into 
light; these in a few more years 
would do away with even the 
memory of the road. And nowhere 
in the green cover could the Com- 
pany find any human mark. Ani- 
mals would have been crossing it re- 
peatedly, the grass springing up be- 
hind them, but had formed no 
visible trails down the length of it; 
possibly any human creatures who 
looked along the desolate way 
would have chilled themselves with 
the thought of ghosts and wanted 
no part of it. But Angus said: “I 
have in my head a sort of compass. 
I think it speaks true mostly. Spin 
me around, I still know somehow 
where the west is, if there’s any day- 
light or moonlight — it doesn’t help 
me in real darkness. I used to 



106 



GALAXY 




astonish my family with it when I 
was a boy. Well, my compass says 
lli is wood road has been trending a 
little bit east for the last hour, as if 
il meant to angle back toward the 
( ireat South Road where we daren’t 
show our faces. But the Old-Time 
l liing is pointing clear west.” He 
shook his dark hair behind his 
shoulder; one of his rare smiles 
touched Demetrios. “I smell the 
Pacific in front of my nose, three 
thousand miles away.” 

Maybe, thought Demetrios, that 
was how it would be for all of the 
journey, and how it ought to be: 
Angus, the wisest of the young, 
would be the true maker of de- 
cisions and giver of directions, but 
he would employ his uncanny tact 
and he would seek the old man’s 
counsel. Under such conditions, 
possibly a little democracy of seven 
souls could be made to function 
without doing too much violence to 
seven patterns of need. A democ- 
rey of seven plus Brand, who 
might take occasion to vote now 
and then after his fashion. 

This was probably the moment, 
voitr novelist supposes, when 
Demetrios- sacred- to- the- Earth de- 
cided to found his own republic, if 
he could keep it. A republic needs 
mothers to breed its sons and 
daughters. He knew that. 

r HE company covered better 
than a mile of the Old-Time 
road, finding no change in its 



quality, and camped comfortably 
beside it before dark. It seemed 
safe to build a good lire. In this 
quiet and loneliness — the fog was 
with them still, faint in the air but 
sad like all memories of antiquity — 
the thought of pursuit from Nuber 
appeared ridiculous, even to Angus. 
“The powers of Inner City,” he 
said, “have nothing against me ex- 
cept my existence. They are rewrit- 
ing history, by the way, did I tell 
you? My uncle Simon may have to 
appear as an arch-villain, Anti- 
christ, whatever, instead of a saint. 
Saints can be a mite inconvenient 
to a King’s Republic — sooner or 
later some crackpot is going to in- 
sist on imitating them, and that 
means more damn work for the 
cops.” He laid gently on the little 
furnace of fhe fire the stick he had 
been using to stir it up. “My disap- 
pearance ought to suit them almost 
as well as — say, a sudden fatal ill- 
ness or a stiletto in the back. Of 
course it may worry them a bit, 
can’t help that.” 

“Will Angus go back there some 
time?” 

He gazed at Solitaire a long time 
across the fire. “Nay, I think not. 
Vengeance is nothing but a sick- 
ness, and what other reason would 
I have? To save the Abramites from 
persecution? — they are already 
under the wheels, and I have no 
power.” 

“One day,” said Demetrios, “the 
Abramites will themselves be the 
oppressors. An old rhythm of his- 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY

tory, another punishment by nature 
of those who were too busy rewrit- 
ing history to read it.” 

“I think I understand you,” said 
Angus. “No — no, I won’t go back.” 
He leaned toward the fire, seeking 
to bring her face nearer to his eyes. 
“I’ve no wish for any place where 
you couldn’t safely come with me.” 
From his quiet speech no one could 
have said whether “you” meant 
only Solitaire or all the Company; 
but the Professor’s lute broke out in 
a sudden music, and Frankie came 
quickly around the fire to kneel by 
him and watch his sovereign fingers 
on the strings. They were carrying a 
familiar melody in and out of 
shadows, letting it play beatific 
games with itself. On the exact mo- 
ment, as the Professor nodded to 
him, Frankie sang, shy at first but 
then with the assurance of an 
angel, the air, said to have been 
composed by a streetcorner musi- 
cian of Brakabin in recent years, 
his name no more known than the 
name of Demetrios, certainly not a 
music of Old Time: 

Before the dark falls 
your flesh is amber fire 
to warm my midnight. 

Before a light spreads 

your mouth gives solace of night 

to cool my noontime. 

1 have not wondered 

that flame and coolness perish: 

to love is mortal.

all of the next day, and the next, 
the ruined road led the Com- 
pany west and a little south. The 
fog was a burden, full of sounds. It 
seemed to Demetrios that he was 
hearing out of the mist what could 
never be heard again, absurd with 
antiquity. Wasn’t that a police 
siren beyond fog-shrouded trees? — 
not the full scream but the yow-yow- 
yow patrol cars used to make to 
clear traffic out of their way? 
“Durn parrots,” said Bosco. 
“Them little whitey ones.” 

“Ayah,” said Angus. "My 
mother keeps one in a cage.” 

An hour later the siren made its 
other fearful cry, the one for acci- 
dent, disaster, fire. “Durn-by 
damn," said Bosco. “Don’t often 
hear catamount sound off like that 
in the daytime.”

GALAXY 




“Overcast days,” said Garth. 
‘‘Or if he’s horny.” 

‘I hearn one last night,” said 
Frankie. “Same, likely.” 

Demetrios could accept it. When 
in time another shrillness sounded, 
taint and small with distance, he 
could scold himself for hearing the 
noon whistle of a factory or town 
siren. But he asked the boy with the 
Old-Time wrist-watch: “What’s the 
lime, Angus?” 

“Noon straight up, man Deme-

Auto horns — the afternoon in

I lie mist itself generating this mad- 
ness? It had seemed in the last 
half-hour to be lifting. Now and 
I lien Demetrios had glimpsed the 
sun’s white blur, finding it too 
si rong to look on directly. Moose or 
deer trumpeting? A daytime owl? 
lie saw Garth frown and Frankie 
look at him with inquiry, but no 
one spoke of it, and presently it 
ceased. 

They noticed a sign saying DEAD 
IND. 

“Crossroads, huh?” said Bosco. 

“God," said Garth, “I wish I 
could read.” 

Bosco caught Demetrios’ eye. “I 
don’t know as that’s what it says, 
but you can see another road 
coming in here, north and south.” 

The placard was of ancient 
metal, raised letters partly oblit- 
erated. Beyond it the black patches 
and disorderly green cover of the 



Old-Time road continued. Brand 
sniffed at the sign and raised his 
leg. “Sure I’ll teach you and 
Frankie to read,” said Angus. “Or 
Demetrios will, or both of us.” 
“Solitaire can teach some,” said 
the frail pregnant lady. “Solitaire 
had the books a little, once.” 
“Books makes folk discontenter- 
ed,” said Bosco. 

“I don’t mind discontent,” said 
Demetrios. Bosco shrugged, 
amiable, finding it not worth an 
argument. “Let’s go on west. If it’s 
really a dead end we can turn 
back.” 



T he old blacktop went on more 
firmly if anything. Perhaps 
someone had played a joke, long 
forgotten; or the road had been ex- 
tended after the sign was placed; or 
whoever was carrying the sign got 
sick of it and rammed it in the 
ground just there — it’s a crazy 
world. When later the Company 
began to hear a vague roaring, felt 
in the feet and knees and guts, 
Demetrios refused to think of heavy 
trucks pelting down a highway 
through air blue with poison to feed 
a monstrous city. “Must be a real 
old man of a waterfall somewhere,” 
said Bosco. 

The road was veering slightly 
south. The noise diminished. When 
it came time to camp for the night 
they still felt its booming in the 
ground but hardly thought about 
it. 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY

Once long ago, a day or two be- 
fore A beredo, I dreamed my father 
was living, and it dismayed my wit- 
less dream-self though I had loved 
him. though we were friends in an 
easier, kindlier way than son and 
father ordinarily can be, because he 
was not vain. If with a wand or a 
prayer I could make Old Time re- 
turn, what would I do? . 

Demetrios also brooded on his 
memory of Old-Time maps. They 
could meet no great river before the 
Delaware. Were they already ap- 
proaching it? The sound droned 
on, chaos talking in its sleep. 

Angus was taking the first two- 
hour watch. Garth with Frankie 
would have the next, then Bosco; 
Demetrios with the Professor would 
take the last, that led into dawn. 
Demetrios sought his blanket but 
feared sleep — he did not wish to 
dream of Hesterville. On the other 
side of the fire Solitaire and the 
Professor sat talking. Her lips 
moved, close to his ear; his face ex- 
pressed innumerable changes of 
doubt, assent, agreement, brood- 
ing. He had put away his lute. He 
seldom made explanatory motions 
of his hands, but his fingers often 
danced on the bridge of his right 
arm, and Solitaire watched that. 
Ah. Paesan! Maybe you don't 
speak because you don 't want to. I f 
voices reach you, if a certain few 
love you and discover your answers, 
it is enough? 

The dark was lightened by a 
blurred moon; overhead Vega, a 



few other eternal lights. A tran- 
sitory music disturbed Demetrios, 
appallingly like the noise made by 
the radio of a quiet car driving by in 
the distance; he heard or imagined 
muted motor noise, passage of tires 
along damp pavement. It happened 
again. He could see now, in the 
night depth, part of the configura- 
tion of the Great Bear. The mist was 
surely dissolving under a breeze; he 
saw the wavering of the black lace- 
work of summer branches. So, in 
among them the wind rubbed a Few 
together and whined its musical 
breath across them . Solitaire 
was kneeling by him. “Angus 
spread his blanket by the spruce 
tree,” she said, “before he went on 
watch.” 

“Yes.” Her hand was soft, a little 
heavy on his arm. 

“Nothing comes between Deme- 
trios and Solitaire.” 

“Nothing.” 

“Paesan knows too. It’s a need.” 

“Understood.” 

“Angus is gentle. The child will 
be safe under his loving.” 

“Go to him. This isn’t Old 
Time.” 

“What about Old Time, man 
Demetrios?” 

“Ah, nothing. Go to him, love. 
He had not been certain until then 
that his love for Angus was firm 
enough to let him say it. Old myth- 
ologies die painfully; but she would 
understand in her own fashion: 
there was no measuring the 
strength or direction of her wisdom

which was so much like her mad- 
ness (said Mam Estelle once) that it 
was silly to draw lines betwxen 
them. 

Perhaps the blue ice of Vega was 
not quite clear of mist. He beard 
and felt the waterfall, continuing 
not forever, only till the next earth- 
quake, next shift of climate in the 
four-billion-year time clock — or 
whatever the estimate was when 
science ceased to be heard. He 
roused heavily from sleep. Bosco 
was refreshing the fire with new 
wood. “Is it my watch?” 

“Nay, only midnight. I’m going 
on. Sorry I disturbed you.” 

“No matter. All quiet?” 

“Quiet enough. Garth and 
Frankie heard a wolf — w'a’n’t close 
by. Might’ve been just k’yote-dog, 
Garth says.” 

“Too deep for that,” said 
Frankie, and he spread his blanket 
by Demetrios. “It were a wolf, by 
lone.” 

“A’n’t he a pisser? Now if he was 
my little brother — ” 

“Think what I missed!” Frankie 
chirped, and settled himself for 
slumber, Garth rolled up on his 
other side; but Frankie was rest- 
less, and soon whispered: “Deme- 
trios, be you much asleep? Would I 
talk you into telling me a story?” 
“Don’t bother the man,” Garth 
yawned.

Asat up in his blanket. The 
night held an unseasonable forest 



chill, and his bones were aching, 
not adapting well to sleeping on the 
ground. “You might, Frankie. It’s 
only the truth there was a young

Mister Jon and he wished to paint 
heroes.” 

“Is painting like singing?” 

“Somewhat yes, someway no.” 
He drew Frankie into the hollow of 
his arm; his left hand fed the fire 
with little twigs; warmth quieted 
pain. “More like than unlike, and 
storytelling is like both. Mister Jon 
(who wasn’t much older than you) 
had no ambition except to be the 
greatest painter who ever lived. He 
consulted Bald Ape-Man (the most 
respected critic in Peranelios) about 
this, and Bald Ape-Man asked 
him: ‘Do you want to be the great- 
est painter who ever lived, or do you 
want to paint?’ Being in a sense the 
brains of the outfit. Mister Jon got 
the point, and set before Bald Ape- 
Man a nice ripe melon he had 
brought, to acknowledge the fact 
that he had so much more sense 
than most critics. You always bring 
something if you consult him; a lot 
depends on whether he eats it or 
throws it at you. Then Mister — ” 

“Well, which?” 

“Which what?” 

“Did he eat it or throw it at 
him?” 

“Oh. Some say one, some say

another — the kind of thing a story- 
teller runs into constantly. Mister 
Jon, as 1 said, wished to paint 
heroes because he thought they 
were interesting. I don’t know why 
exactly, but in Peranelios, same as 
anywhere, the problem is to find 
them.” 

“Where’s Peranelios?’’ 

“Other side of the Never-Today 
Mountains.” 

“1 thought prob’ly. Like the 
fairytales my aunt tells, things 
always happen where you can’t go. 
But,” said Frankie, warm and 
drowsy, “I’d rather listen to one 
any time than go to sleep. Any 
time.” 

“So would I. Mister Jon asked 
his father if he knew where to find 
any heroes. Mister Jon’s father had 
fought in the wars against the pi- 
rates, was in fact aboard the flag- 
ship when the fleet crept before 
dawn through the Narrows of Gor 
to attack the pirates’ secret harbor. 
He had no idea where Mister Jon 
could find any heroes, and was 
cross with him for interrupting a 
glass of beer. Mister Jon drew a 
sketch of him looking cross, and 
left home that night to look for 
heroes. The picture bothered him 
by looking more like himself than 
like his father, but much later, 
when he was hard up, he managed 
to sell it to an Admiral who had 
known his father, for the price of a 
night’s lodging and a bowl of soup. 

“On his first day away from 
home he came on a brawny young 



armored horseman with a lance 
confronting a fearsome fiery dra- 
gon, which was just what he was 
looking for. He asked the noble 
youth: ‘Would you just hold that 
lance a mite more slantwise? — 
okay, that’s it. By the way, aren’t 
you fighting over something, maid- 
en or whatever?’ 

“‘Well, we sent for her,’ said the 
dragon, ‘but the little misery is late. 
She always is.’ 

“‘Dunnowhat gets into maidens 
nowadays,’ said the hero, who was 
older than Mister Jon had thought. 
‘ I hey aren’t what they were. Let’s 
not wait. Have I got this right, with 
the lance?’ 

“‘Fine,’ said Mister Jon. 

“‘My other profile is better,’ said 
the dragon. They fixed that, and it 
turned out to be his most salable 
painting — he did several, with im- 
provements and maidens and so 
on — but Mister Jon wasn’t satis- 
fied: the hero, and sometimes the 
dragon, always looked like himself. 
He hunted up other types of hero, 
and had the same difficulty. The 
subjects couldn’t see it — they were 
looking of course only for their own 
selves and (of course) always found 
them — but Mister Jon saw it. It still 
bothered him when he arrived at 
the capital. 

“There he consulted the Great 
Stone Face, which stands in a fine 
plaza in the capital of Peranelios 
and is the rnv’cc-as-much respected 
critic in the whole nation, since it 
never says anything at all. Its

manner of never saying anything 
conveyed to Mister Jon that the 
hero thing itself might be causing 
the trouble. Instead of heroes per- 
haps he ought to paint only the 
most noble, brave, and beatific 
people he could find. He tried that, 
earning somewhat less than before, 
though a number of nice people 
had nice things to say. You see, the 
trouble was — the trouble was — ” 
“They all looked like him,” said 
Frankie. “But the people he paint- 
ed couldn’t see it, right?” 

“Right. He could. After a while 
he found out why it was.” 

“Guess you better tell me.” 

“He himself was the only person 
of any kind he actually knew. He 
could love others, and paint them 
too, but never know. He was hero, 
thief, beggar, dragon, saint. I for- 
got to tell you his last name was 
Everyman. Mister Jon Everyman.” 
“1 guess it’s a sort of a sad 
story.” Frankie yawned. 

“I suppose. Might not be all that 
sad after a good sleep.” 

“Might not.” Frankie burrowed 
back into his blanket, where pre- 
sently a large sigh tapered off in a 
small snore. 

M y novelist’s privilege is to 
say that as he sat on there 
watching the lire and feeding it 
little twigs, until Bosco came to give 
him the wristwatch for his tour of 
guard duty with the Professor, 
Demetrius composed other endings 
for that story\ some of them more 



suited to Frankie s youth — [ how 
smart we think we are!) — and some 
not. I could give you a few, but I’m 
afraid of making you even more im- 
patient. Not that / blame you too 
much — here we are into Chapter 
Eleven and I haven't even reached 
the point where I appear as a char- 
acter. Never mind — better times 
coming. 

I n the morning the mist had 
grown deep once more, and it 
was under the mist that the Com- 
pany found the Old-Time road im- 
proving, becoming a decent small 
thoroughfare. Grass and weeds were 
beaten down though not destroyed, 
the more threatening saplings had 
been chopped off — road work, for 
which we may hope somebody got 
paid. The noise of waterfall dimin- 
ished, subtly changed, as the Com- 
pany moved on west: it was more 
like the protest of a river forced be- 
tween narrow banks, and Deme- 
trios could feel it as deeply as ever, 
a vibration in the ground. 

Another crossroad angled in; 
half a mile further on, another, 
from the south. Along this, loom- 
ing big and blurred in the mist, 
then sharpening to natural outlines, 
came a graying couple with a 
golden bird in a cage. They nodded 
politely to the Company, and the 
man asked: “Be you on your way to 
the Ferry?” 

“If that’s w'here the road goes,” 
said Demetrios — for this morning 
Angus, drowsy and absent-minded

from a night of tender games, ap- 
peared to want Demetrios to be 
leader and decision-maker. 

The stranger woman didn’t like 
that answer. “Where else would it 
go?” she demanded, and she may 
have thought Demetrios or her hus- 
band deaf, for she repeated: “I say 
where else could it go?” Her man 
carrying the cage — they had no 
other baggage — smiled placatingly. 

Solitaire left her place by Angus 
and chirped her lips at the bird, 
who broke into wild caroling under 
her gaze. “Give him here,” said the 
woman, “I say give him here.” She 
took the cage — no doubt the man 
really was deaf — and covered it 
with a gray cloth she had been 
carrying tucked under her belt. The 
singing ceased. “We’ll walk a ways 
behind you good folk,” she said. 
“That way he won’t make so much 
trouble.” 

Frankie fell back presently to 
make friends with them, but they 
were embarrassed or afraid — (was 
it possible to be afraid of 
Frankie? — yes) — covering the bird 
again hastily because its music 
burst forth at his mere approach. 
Demetrios glimpsed his efforts, 
which won only tight-mouth 
mumbles from the woman, dim 
smiles from the man. Soon Frankie 
gave it up and rejoined the Com- 
pany, battled and rather angry; but 
whatever he said was for Garth’s 
ears only. The couple plodded on 
ten yards or so behind, and no one 
else had turned up when they all 



came down a long stony slope to the 
ferry-house. 

It stood between fog-laced trees. 
Fog held the waters beyond it to in- 
finity. The Company was hardly 
aware of the presence of the stream 
until they had reached the ferry- 
house itself; then here, magnified 
by the high bank, the slow great 
noise of it was all around them. As 
on the previous days, the fog ap- 
peared to be thinning off, yet never 
did, quite; or if it did, this was no 
more than the tantalizing lift of a 
curtain which for clumsy reasons of 
its own must come down one more 
time — 

I F you ever got stuck with a part 
in amateur theatricals ( which 
haven't improved noticeably since 
the original carry-on among the 
Swiss lake-dwellers) you 'll have 
noticed the mess we invariably run 
into with the damned curtain — 
sticks, comes down too soon on the 
tenor's neck, works any way except

some try to get along without one, 
tr\’ to smuggle the cast in behind a 
screen till called for, and the fat 
one drops his spear, clank, dongle, 
and when he stoops for it his ass 
knocks the screen over and there 
they be — (the Swiss lake-dwellers 
always used a curtain) — what I’m 
wishing to convey is that if you've 
had this Experience it just might 
give you some sympathy with a 
novelist obliged to deal with the fog

T he ferry-house stood gray 
and old, the pier worn with 
traffic (yet no one else was coming 
now) and green in its sheltered 
parts with water-weed and mold. 
The furled sail of the ferry dripped 
condensing fog. But a cheerful 
lamp was visible through the in- 
shore window of the ferry-house. 
The Manager could be seen sopping 
up a lunch of fried egg with a piece 
of bread, wiping a gray mustache. 
His name appeared on a sign above 
the door: 

DELAWARE CROSSING 
(Washinton Slep here) 

R.C. Noah, Mgr. 
CUSTOM SAILINGS 10c 

Mr. Noah flung wide the door be- 
fore they could enter, a gray titan 
dwarfing Bosco’s mass and Deme- 
trios' height. Brand cringed as 
Demetrios had never yet seen him 
do, recovering his courage swiftly 
but making no overtures of friend- 
ship though Mr. Noah was beam- 
ing after his grim fashion. “So 
wha’d’y’ want?” He was just a big, 
rude, noisy old man in a gray loin- 
cloth, with egg smears on his mus- 
tache. 



“We’re traveling west,” said 
Angus. “When’s your next trip?” 
“Any time. I don’t run no God- 
damn timetable. What’s nice 
people like you want to go west 
for?” 

“I came from there,” said Deme- 
trios. 

“That’s no reason. Nothing now 
except wilderness, after Penn.” 
“We don’t like it where we are,” 
said Bosco. “See? By the way, Mis- 
ter, you seen or heard anything of 
an outfit called Gammo’s 
Ramblers?” 

“No.” 

“We’re separate,” said the 
woman with the bird-cage. “Here, 
take it while I get out the change.” 
But she had to shake her husband’s 
arm to get his attention. “I say take 
the cage while I get out the 
change.” 

“Needn’t to be in no such rush, 
ma’am,” said Mr. Noah. “We ain’t 
gosemplacing no place till I been to 
the John and back.” 

“Disgusting fellow!’’ But she 
said that under her breath, and 
after Mr. Noah had ducked back 
into his diminutive ferry-house. 

“He ain’t so long on politeness, 
it’s a fact,” said Bosco. “All’s I 
done was ask a fair question.’’ 
Solitaire too had shown a flare of 
anger, but at the touch of Angus’ 
arm around her she relaxed, look- 
ing up at him in a haze of confi- 
dence. Bosco added: “Y’ know, I 
ain't sure I could take that guy.” 
Frankie laughed. Demetrios said: 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY 



115 




“Don’t try, man.” Frankie ceased 
laughing and moved nearer to 
Garth, who was at that moment the 
calmest of the Company. 

Mr. Noah returned and strode 
down the narrow wharf, blocking 
access to his miserable boat by 
standing there with an open palm. 
The stranger woman moved in 
ahead, glaring at Angus though he 
had already stepped back for her. 
She placed a dime in Mr. Noah’s 
hand. “We only got half of your 
outrageous fare. Supposed to be a 
nickel.” 

“For half I can take you half-way 
across,” said Mr. Noah. 

“I never heard such nonsense!” 

“Or I’ll take the bird in pay for 
the other half. Nice little bird like 
that would brighten up the joint.” 

“Well — all right. Give him the 
cage.” Her husband smiled on 
gently into the fog. “I say give him 
the cage.” She snatched it from 
him herself and gave it to Mr. 
Noah, who lifted away the cloth. 

The bird cocked an eye at Mr. 
Noah and tenderly sang. “There!” 
said Mr. Noah. “There now!” He 
was still admiring his acquisition 
when Angus paid, but was attentive 
enough to notice the eight dimes. 
He gave one back. “Won’t charge 
the dog nothing. He kills a rat or 
two it’ll more’n pay his fare.” 
Demetrios saw a red-gray slick- 
moving shape scuttle under a 
thwart as the stranger couple stum- 
bled forward in the boat looking for 
the driest place to sit. “Be he a 



good ratter? The rats is awful 
lately.” 

“Oh, lie’s death on rats,” said 
Angus. 

“By God I could do with a good 
ratter around the place.” 

“1 could never sell him.” 

“Didn’t much think you would. 
He can still ride for free.” They 
got no more conversation from Mr. 
Noah. He spread the soggy sail, 
pushed off, took the tiller, and 
whistled up a breeze — well, it had 
actually begun to. blow, and favor- 
ably, about five minutes before he 
whistled, thinning out the fog into 
lazy-floating ghosts and spirits of 
sadness that made way for the ad- 
vancing sail above gray water — 

F or there was always plenty 
of ham in Mr. Noah, other- 
wise the Delaware Crossing Corpo- 
ration could hardly have kept him 
in that job as long as they have, and 
H he chose to make it appear that a 
a minor shift of surface meteorolo- 
gical conditions came about in re- 
sponse to his whistle, his personal 
egg-eating will, / suppose he can he 
allowed that little vanity ; especially 
since / am almost done with this 
part of the book, the fog part. On 
the whole you ve been very > patient, 
veiy nice. Thank you. 

B rand did kill that rat, and the 
golden bird did sing — vigor- 
ously, after the sun came through 
enough to show evergreens and 
willows on the approaching bank.

A great river, though not the 
widest; the shore the travelers had 
left behind was not visible when 
they disembarked, but that was be- 
cause of the fog lingering over 
there, evidently characteristic of 
this part of the world. The Com- 
pany watched Mr. Noah reentering 
that fog-bank; Demetrios thought 
he heard the golden bird still sing- 
ing. 

Beyond the landing the Old- 
Time road continued, in better re- 
pair. No more fog. Every branch, 
every little stone and weed was 
washed in the clean warmth of 
afternoon. At the first cross-road 
the stranger woman said: “We go 
this way.” She tugged at her hus- 
band’s arm. He nodded diffidently 
to Demetrios; they were gone. 

The Company had moved on a 
quarter of a mile, each heart follow- 
ing its own course in solitude, when 
Solitaire stopped in her tracks, eyes 
dilated. She had been walking with 
Angus, lovingly though without 
touching him. She swung about 
and ran back down the road a short 
way, and hurled her oaken stick 
savagely in the direction the stran- 
ger couple had taken. “Fools! 
Idiots!" She tried to shout more, 
but it strangled on the weeping in 
her throat. 

Demetrios reached her first and 
held her lightly; sometimes in her 
rages she had torn her clothes, 
raked her arms with her nails. He 
felt her shrink, and again when 
Angus took her hands, but she 



made no effort to break free. 
“What if the bird dies?” 

“I suppose,” said Angus, “some 
would say he was their bird.” 

“He was. But he sang for Soli- 
taire. He sang for Frankie.” 
“Solitaire — ” 

“What do you mean? Who is 
Solitaire? O Demetrios, Demetrios, 
what if Solitaire lost her madness? 
What could Solitaire do without 
her madness? There wasn’t any 
gang-rape, Demetrios. Why- — why, 
she just strayed from Brakabin, got 
lost, the stupid thing, all the way 
from Brakabin because her stupid 
fucking mother told her to walk the 
stupid fucking dog, she would have 
had to go past the house where 
my — my — the house where my — ” 
She watched her tight hands re- 
lax as Angus rubbed them. He 
said: “The bird was singing when 
the ferryman sailed with him.” 

She nodded and smiled, bril- 
liantly, rationally. But memory 
closed the door that some passion 
had briefly blown open. That was 
all the Company ever did learn of 
whatever world had made Solitaire 
whatever she was. Frankie recover- 
ed the oak branch and she accepted 
it. “O Brains of the Outfits,” she 
said, “we start learning letters at 
the next halt, and it won’t be easy.” 
“So what’s easy?” 

“That’s my friend. Now Solitaire 
wants music.” 

As they walked on she swung her 
stick in rhythm with the old man’s, 
having linked arms with Demetrios 



THE COMPANY OF GLORY

as a free and independent spirit, 
and the Professor fell in behind 
them plinking a sassy march. 
Frankie darted in before them as a 
drum major, beating on the tin dish 
from his sack with his pewter 
spoon, and caroling ancient and 
venerable words in response to the 
Professor’s tune: 

“Mademoiselle from Armen- 
tieres, parlez-vous? 

Mademoiselle from Armen- 
tieres, parlez-vous — 

She’s hard to curry above the 
knees 

But falls on her back with the 
greatest of ease. 

Hinky-dinky, parlez-vous!” 

(Some verses have survived that 
even Frankie didn’t know.) Garth 
whistled and sang a bit himself. 
Angus blasted away at a glass- 
blade set between his thumbs. 
Bosco pounded his chest and 
slapped his thighs, now and then 
going boom! for a bass drum, and 
Brand frisked about in astonished 
admiration, making dog noises off 
pitch. Thus it was that the Com- 
pany came down in fine though in- 
formal style on the peaceable, pros- 
perous, somewhat conservative 
Penn town of Trottersville. 

The Old-Time road had petered 
out; through the trees could be seen 
a better, modern dirt road, with 
reasonable hoof-prints, sandal- 
marks, wagon tracks. As Mademoi- 
selle brought them out on this they 



saw, quite near, rooftops on lower 
ground, pasture fences, a church 
spire catching sunlight. Demetrios 
described for Angus the spectacle 
of men and dogs driving a herd of 
shoats down to the village, on the 
other side of town where a low hill 
lifted the road. Trottersville was a 
pigs and chickens town. A rooster 
crowed. Bosco smiled. 

Trottersville, as everyone knows, 
was founded ages ago by a family 
named Trotter (or Trotters), but 
the only statue on the green is that 
of a pig, done in one of the late 20th 
Century styles to look like an egg- 
beater except from the south. The 
inscription in the pedestal reads 
MY THING, but this has been 
filled with putty and painted, so 
maybe it shouldn’t be discussed, 
though it does keep showing 
through. From the south The Little 
Hog looks more like a pair of 
scissors upside down. Every weath- 
ervane in town is a gilded cock. 

The Company made for the inn, 
Angus confident of the value of his 
Katskil money. The hostel dis- 
played a sign of a boar’s head, and 
carried medieval tradition further 
by placing an evergreen branch to 
project from the doorway and tell 
the illiterate that drinks were to be 
had here. Angus’ money was good 
indeed, the loft was available with 
room for everyone including Brand, 
and the drinks were drinkable. 

Best of all, Sawyer Finn’s Circus 
was in town.

R eaders of this column may 
have been led to believe that, 
due to my preoccupation with the 
growing edge of sf, I lack reverence 
for the hard core, the “pure” 
science fiction which derives from 
the pure sciences. If so, I can 
understand it, but must assert that 
my philosophic posture in the 
matter is only one facet of my way- 
of-thinking about all things. The 
growing edge is a life manifesta- 
tion, dynamic and changing, as is 
common to all living things. The es- 
tablished, the conventional, is sub- 
ject only to refinement, and refine- 
ments of refinements, an activity 
suitable to the keepers of monu- 
ments and the polishers of tombs. 
To my mind, this is the province of 



technologists and engineers, not of 
science and scientists. “Science” 
derives from the Latin scientia, 
which means knowledge. The 
seekers of knowledge come first, 
the devisers follow. Intuition (a 
species of creativity) precedes 
theory, theory plus reason produces 
hypothesis, hypothesis plus experi- 
ment produces hardware. Sf which 
is obsessed by hardware often ex- 
trapolates into the future by re- 
fining refinements, which is most 
gratifying to those who admire 
human ingenuity, who are, for 
example, awestruck by the legend 
of the American watchmaker who 
sent the “world’s finest hairspring” 
to Geneva for the amazement of the 
Swiss, who sent it back by return 



119 




mail with five hundred holes drilled 
in it. Nevertheless, the extrapola- 
tion of hardware into the future 
makes it easy to commit the error of 
a 1900 artist who drew a city scene 
of that distant year 1950. Among 
towering skyscrapers not unlike 
contemporary ones, he had power- 
ed aircraft moving. The aircraft 
were blimps, the power-train, end- 
ing in quite creditable propellors, 
began with a tethered horse gal- 
loping on a treadmill. The word for 
that is (along with ‘ingenious’ and 
‘logical’ and, considering the ar- 
tist’s difficulties, ‘credible’ and ‘ad- 
mirable’) “quaint.” So too is much 
of the celebrated sf of sf s most 
golden years; so too is much of the 
hard-core sf being written today. 

Sf people — the very best writers, 
editors, and the top-level readers — 
long ago ceased to live in bio- 
graphical time (the era in which 
“I” was born) and in historical 
time, but operate with geological 
and astronomical and cosmological 
perspectives. Such perspectives, 
though they may honor the cuckoo- 
clock ingenuity of the perpetrators, 
instantly wince at the presence of 
knobs, dials, and wiring in far- 
future devices. Reaction engines of- 
fend them, as do certain concepts 
of royalty and commercial profit 
extended into the far future. Such 
sf people do not know precisely 
what will replace these things, but 
they have enough grasp of evolution 
in all its aspects (including its 
ability to progress unevenly from 



time to time) to know intuitively 
that they are as quaint as a horse on 
a Hying treadmill. 

Yet the monuments stand, and 
should be reverenced. If it were not 
for those who have gone before, the 
discovery that a stone can be 
thrown to kill something edible be- 
yond arm’s reach may have been 
made as recently as my father’s 
time, and 1 might never know of it 
except that I had seen him do it. 
The same discovery may have been 
made twelve hundred times over 
twelve hundred generations, and 
might need to be discovered yet 
again a thousand times, were it not 
for my forebears and their ability to 
preserve knowledge and devise ways 
to transmit it. However tall we may 
be, our feet are on the shoulders of 
our predecessors, and it takes an 
especially disgusting kind of fool to 
pride himself on his altitude as if it 
were his alone. Therefore I view the 
reappearance of old hard-core, and 
the appearance of new hard-core, 
through a filter colored more with 
ancestor-worship than with mere 
nostalgia. My own personal debt to 
the old-timers of sf can hardly be 
assessed, and I am most pleased to 
acknowledge it.

pearance of two huge volumes

graphical introductions by Isaac 
Asimov, and The Mote in God’s 
Eve (Simon and Schuster, $9.95) by 
Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, a 
brand-new novel. 

Before the Golden Age is 
uniquely and delightfully Asimov. 
Primarily, if I may override the 
good Doctor’s astonishing (but, I 
hasten to add, utterly justified) 
ability to illuminate himself like a 
public building (and believe me, 
friends, there is no energy shortage 
that can darken those arcs) — pri- 
marily, then, the book is a much- 
wanted aggregate of the long-re- 
membered, mostly long-lost mas- 
terpieces of ragged-pulp sf which 
fired up so many of the writers who, 
in their turn, gave their gold to the 
Golden Age of John Campbell’s 
Astounding. How many who read 
these words recall the stirring of 
their blood, that special shimmer- 
ing of the mind brought to them by 
Edmond Hamilton, Clifford W. 
Simak, Donald Wandrei? Remem- 
ber Raymond Z. Gallun, Charles 
R. Tanner and the early John W. 
Campbell, Jr.? These and other of 
the great old giants (many of 
whom, by the way, are writing 
today) are represented here to re- 
kindle the old sense of wonder in 
those who knew them when, and to 
show latecomers where it all came 
from. The big book is stitched to- 
gether by interpolations of the 
almost eidetic Asimov’s biographi- 
cal recollections. He remembers, 
and shares the memory vividly and 



touchingly — and at times hilarious- 
ly — where he was, who he was, 
what he was doing and thinking 
and feeling as he encountered each 
of these 26 fine old stories. One can 
only be grateful. If you can’t spring 
for the price — even though it’s 
worth every penny — agitate your 
local library to put it in. 

And now for The Mote in God’s 
Eve. Let me say at the outset that I 
recommend it heartily as one of the 
most engrossing tales I have en- 
countered in years. Anything this 
size runs the risk, purely by its 
capacity, of carrying more flaws 
than a slighter work, and it carries 
them all right. But the overall pace 
of the book, the sheer solid story of 
it, excuses everything. What fasci- 
nates me, what makes the book so 
well worth writing about, is that the 
skilled and knowledgeable Messrs. 
Niven and Pournelle know about 
the Haws, and in the course of the 
narrative excuse them all — all but 
one, that is, and that one is up to 
the reader’s credence. 

This is a First Contact story, and 
fully measures up to one of John 
Campbell’s most seminal — and 
most difficult — challenges: write 
me a story about something that 
can think as well as a human, but 
not like a human. This they have 
done, and beautifully. Their 
“Moties” are as unusual an e-t as 
anything ever done in the field. I 
am not going to spoil your surprise 
at discovering their most outstand- 
ing physical uniqueness, but the

rationale for it is clear and com- 
pelling. All the hard science is 
good — the astronomy, the physics, 
the mathematical infrastructure. 
About the sociology I cannot be 
quite as accepting, and it is in the 
area of biology, so important to the 
sociological situation, that I cavil 
the most — and it is on a biological 
factor that the social and political 
and military situations absolutely 
pivot. I must ask the question: in a 
species so knowledgeable about its 
own terrible history and the causes 
of its terror, and at the same time 
so adept in the biological sciences — 
especially genetic engineering — 
why could they not have found a 
solution to their dreadful problem? 
The authors simply say they could 
not; and on that fact hangs the 
whole complex structure of the 
book. You believe this or you don’t. 
Even if you don’t, you are going for 
quite a ride. 

So you see that the old, or Old 
Wave, or traditional sf is not dead. 
It can be resurrected and it can be 
re-done, and when these things 
happen, it can be deeply enjoyed. 
Let notice be served, then, that a 
predeliction for the growing edge 
does not in itself downgrade the 
importance of past majesties. To 
point out who it is that polishes the 
monuments is not at all the same 
thing as saying they should not be 
polished. 

H ere 1 commit something I 
have never done before: rec- 



ommend a book I have not yet 
finished reading. If I finish reading 
it now I’ll jeopardize my deadline. 
It’s D.G. Compton’s The Unsleep- 
ing Eve, which so far seems to be 
the very finest thing this remark- 
able writer ( Chronocules , The Steel 
Crocodile, Synthajoy, and Farewell 
Earth's Bliss) has done to date. I 
promise a full report in my next, 
but you mustn’t wait a month, or a 
minute, to get into this beautifully 
written book. It’s from DAW, at 
$1.25. 

U njustly briefs: Due to a 
change in publishers. Orbit 13 
(Putnam’s, 250 pp., $5.95) and 
Orbit 14 (Harper & Row, 210 pp., 
$6.95) arrived on this desk close to- 
gether. All originals by writers old 
and new, they are Best Buys when- 
ever they appear. The Damon 
Knight name on them is like the

Without Future, by Jacques Stern- 
berg (Seabury Press, 210 pp.,

worth buying for a single long 
novelette, Fin de Siecle, which not 
only predicts horrors far surpassing 
anything Orwell ever thought of, 
but is cognizant of the probability 
of some now-unknown technology 
which can — will — affect the entire

Post-war Awakening, and The

DICK HOAGLAND calls himself a 
“communicator,” a science interpreter 
for the layman. In various planetaria 
he has held posts such as Curator of 
Astronomy and Space Science; Direc- 
tor of Public Programming; and re- 
cently, Coordinator of Public Affairs 
and Special Events at the American 
Museum-Hayden Planetarium 

He is the creator and director of the 
“Voyage Seminars” — cruise/confer- 
ences at sea. The first, "Voyage Be- 
yond Apollo,” incuded offshore view- 
ing of the night-launch of Apollo 17. 
In January of this year the two-week 
“Voyage of the Comet” provided opti- 
mum viewing of the elusive Kohoutek. 

Dick held the post of Science Ad- 
visor to CBS Special Events during the 
Apollo Program and worked closely 
with Walter Cronkite from 1968-1971. 



He also worked with Arthur Clarke on 
a TV film based on Mr. Clarke’s book, 
“Promise of Space.” As Project Scien- 
tist he arranged for experiments con- 
ducted by Sheila Scott on herEquator- 
to-Equator Across-the-Pole flight in 
1971 . Also in 1971 he co-fathered "the 
plaque”— Man’s first interstellar mes- 
sage, en route out of the solar system 
aboard Pioneer 10. 

Dick is unmarried and lives pres- 
ently in Norwalk, Conn. Asked if he 
has any hobbies, Dick says, “Only 
changing the world.” Pressed further, 
he replies that he enjoys music (he 
was once a professional singer, re- 
corded on Columbia Records), flying, 
sailing, and considers himself to be “a 
pretty good painter.” Dick has also re- 
cently been named Science Editor for 
Worlds of IF.

i 

^nEE what’s on TV, Norman.” 
Ij Jean settled in her chair with 
a pile of flowered fabric on her lap 
and the old button box. Norman 
obediently went to the console, 
fiddled with dials. A troupe of 
hyperactive blue people in some 
sort of native costume appeared on 
the screen. He adjusted the color. 

“That’s fine.” There was a si- 
lence filled only by the swirring 
sound of balalaika. Norman leafed 
through the program guide. “Hey! 
There’s an interview with Habib on 
Channel 11.” 

"Norman, Momma’s enjoying 
the dancing. Aren’t you. Momma?” 

The old lady sitting straight up in 
the easy chair smiled bravely. 

“Never mind about me, dear, I'll 
get along somehow,” she said, 
smoothing the patterned material 
of her dress. 

“It’s those Russian dancers,” 
Jean stage-whispered unnecessarily. 
“Won’t they do as well as that 
Arab, dear?” 

Norman said, “Okay, okay,” 
and tried to achieve something ap- 
proaching equilibrium in the rock- 
ing chair. He reorganized himself 



several times, then got up and went 
to the kitchen for a can of beer. 

“Want some, anybody?” he of- 
fered . 

“No, thanks,” said Jean. “Don’t 
forget Momma’s ginger ale,” she 
called after him. 

Norman fetched the ginger ale 
with the requisite two ice cubes, 
which naturally meant getting out 
the ice tray, running water on it to 
loosen the cubes, replacing it in the 
freezer compartment, opening the 
bottle with the sealed screw-top 
which invariably cut his finger; 
nursing his wound he sat down 
again. He looked wistfully through 
the TV program guide. He thought, 
“Well, the paper will report the 
interview tomorrow if he says any- 
thing important . Goddamn it, 
why can’t she watch her own TV 
set? When she moved in it was all ‘I 
won’t be any trouble’ and ‘I’ll stay 
in my own little room upstairs and 
not bother you, you’ll hardly know 
I’m here’ . We bought her the 
set so we could have ours to our- 
selves ... I wonder if she ever 
turns it on . I’d feel funny to go 
and turn on her set uninvited. If I 
ask there’ll be a scene . Come to 
think of it, did we ever invite her to 



125 




look at ours every night? She just — 
arrived. Oh, well, I suppose 
she needs company . Somehow 
we don’t seem to go up to visit her 
much . Hell, we don’t need to. 
She’s always here.” He drew at his 
beer. Momma pursed her lips. The 
battle of “Norman’s drinking” had 
been joined but never fought; 
Momma knew exactly when not to 
press an issue. She merely stopped 
whatever she was doing and Listen- 
ed to the beer being poured. 

Jean, catching Momma’s eye, an- 
nounced hastily, “Momma, it’s 
eleven o’clock. Shall I see you up to 
bed?” 

“When you’re as decrepit as I am 
you have to keep busy or you can’t 
STAND it,” said Momma. 

“Now, Momma, it’s getting 
late.” 

'“There’s nothing left for me but 
my family. I just have to depend on 
you, dear. And Norman.” 

Jean rose and helped her to the 
staircase. “Momma, we’re not go- 
ing anyplace. Goodnight now.” 

“I have nothing to look forward 
to, that’s all.’’ Momma’s voice 
dwindled off. 

Norman was standing, politely. 
“Good night, Momma.” He dash- 
ed to the TV and pushed the button 
for Channel 11; too late, of course. 
He sighed and switched to a news- 
cast; there might be a recap. If 
Habib had agreed to come to the 
White House, the Arab oil bloc’s 
complacent monopoly might yet be 
broken. 



“Honey, turn it down a little.” 
Jean picked up the pile of sewing. 

“Are you making something?” 

“Just buttons on Momma’s 
dress.” 

“Oh.” 

The newscast reported nothing 
on the Middle East; the war in 
Malaysia was, as usual, bloody. 
Some scientists had announced a 
new development in memory cells. 
He didn’t catch it. 

“There seems to be more news in 
automation,” he said. 

Jean looked up. “Anything 
wrong at work, dear?” 

“No, no. Just wondering in 
general. Might affect us, from what 
little I heard . Unemployment’s 
up again.” 

“So they’ll step up the war. They 
always do.” 

“Mmm.” 

Jean put aside the dress. “I’m 
sorry you missed the interview,” 
she said. “But . .” 

“I understand,” said Norman. 
“I’m still understanding, so far.” 
She smiled at him tiredly and car- 
ried her things toward the door. 

“Bedtime?” 

“I’ll be along.” He wanted an- 
other beer. 



at the office there was a rumor 
that the business was either 
going to fold — or convert. Nor- 
man’s job didn’t bring him close to 
management; he shrugged. Engi- 
neering had been the field of the 



126 



GALAXY 




future; here was the future and he 
often suspected it was beyond him. 
The computers for which he had 
been trained had been obsolete be- 
fore he’d finished his degree. Now 
they were talking about the sixth 
stage, colloids no less. It sounded 
as if you’d have to have a biology 
degree to be an engineer next. 

On the way home he stopped at a 
bar. What had he to look forward 
to at home, anyway? He couldn’t 
even hold hands with his wife until 
after 1 1 o’clock. 

“Rye and ginger, please.” Tran- 
sistors he understood. He might as 
well be into vacuum tubes. Micro- 
synchs had taken him two years on 
the job to master; and now this. 

“Just what is it the damn things 
can do now that they couldn’t do 
before?” said a bellicose voice be- 
hind him. 

“They judge,” was the reply. 
Was the whole damned office in 
this bar? “Make decisions. Compli- 
cated decisions. Like whether or 
not to fire a man.” 

“Oh, God.” A chair scraped the 
floor. “It was bad enough when we 
had psychologists all over the place. 
It was bad enough when we all got 
cards that onfy IBM and God 
understood. It was bad enough 
when half the business spoke dia- 
lects that the rest of us couldn’t 
understand. I tell you the union 
won’t stand for this.” 

“It won’t matter. By the time 
they’ve got the kinks out nobody 
will need union men. The Black 



Box will be running us all, buddy, 
men are too damned expensive. All 
they’ll need will be designers and 
rock singers. We’ll be getting plas- 
tic imitation gold-leaf doohickeys 
on our car doors ...” 

Norman finished his drink. He 
wondered glumly how long it would 
take for this apparently universally 
widespread information to sift 
through the company to him. The 
typists probably knew already, they 
always did. He’d really be in the 
soup if he were fired. He wondered 
if they would do him the courtesy of 
a personal interview after eleven 
years, or if it would just be the blue 
paycheck instead of the yellow . 
they’d all be in the soup. He found 
himself visualizing breaking the 
news to Momma with intense, per- 
verse delight. 

“You’re very late, aren’t you?” 
Jean was surrounded by pieces of 
paper, writing busily. “I’ll just 
finish this month’s statement and 
get you some dinner. We ate hours 
ago.” 

“Isn’t that Momma’s check- 
book? Can’t she do that herself?” 

Jean laughed. “She hasn’t been 
able to add since she flunked 
second grade. Poor dear, there’s 
not enough in the account to risk 
mixing up the decimal places, till 
her dividend checks come in.” 

“Hmph.” He really ought to 
have liberated a desk calculator 
when he had the chance, he 
thought. Probably wouldn’t ever 
have another opportunity. 



FAMILY PROGRAM 



127 




There was a stomping at the 
door. 

“Hello, Momma, how was the 
bridge club?” 

“When you’re as decrepit as I am 
you have to keep busy or you can’t 
STAND it,” said Momma, shaking 
her umbrella over the hall rug. 

“What’s the matter? Did you 
lose or something?” 

“Sometimes I think you don’t 
care if I’m here or if I’m dead,” 
said Momma, tossing her raincoat 
inaccurately at the coatraek. 
“Well, I won’t be around much 
longer.” 

“Are you going someplace?” He 
wondered if his bank account could 
bear another Florida vacation. He 
had managed to make the last one 
appear to have come out of 
Momma’s own account “to save her 
feelings”, but this time, with every- 
thing so uncertain . 

Momma sank reproachfully into 
the armchair. 

“Here’s your checkbook. Mom- 
ma.” Jean collected the papers and 
put them away. She turned on the 
TV. 

Norman wandered around, bor- 
ed with Doctor Kildare. The women 
were glued to, their seats. The fif- 
teenth handsome young man to 
have essayed that part in its long 
history smiled bravely as he pulled 
on his rubber gloves. 

“Jean, I want to go for a walk.” 

“Okay, dear.” she replied, not 
taking her eyes off the screen. “It’s 
cleared up outside.” 



Norman looked at her hopefully; 
would she offer to join him? It ob- 
viously hadn’t occurred to her. Oh, 
well. 

“Uh ... I won’t be long.” 

Jean waved absently. 

N ext morning each of the desks 
bore a sealed memo. There 
was a subdued kerfuffle as the en- 
velopes were torn open. Row after 
row of heads looked up and around, 
the few smiles vanishing as the 
smilers took in the stricken expres- 
sions on the faces of their col- 
leagues. Nobody spoke. The union 
men rose in a body and left the bull 
pen. 

Norman had been chosen. He 
would be retained. He would not be 
joining the Great Obsolesced — not 
yet. The union men . what use 
was it to strike if you weren’t 
needed? 

For the next six weeks classes 
would be held daily. In any case 
there was going to be a lag in orders 
while the customers waited to see 
what the new development would 
offer. 

He was right about the biology. 
This molecular data storage system 
was an offshoot of DNA/RNA re- 
search. The capacity of the colloid 
was astronomically greater than 
that of transistors, and geometri- 
cally greater than that of micro- 
synchs. The programming would 
require no coding — the colloids 
could easily accommodate a voca- 



128 



GALAXY 




bulary in any number of languages. 
Once the black boxes had been told 
what to do, no further program- 
ming would be required. 

And he, Norman, was allocated a 
special code number for access to 
the Big C, the central computer 
which served not only his company, 
but all the U.S. Government offices 
as well. Security clearance, secret 
phone numbers, private telephone 
hookup to the Big C itself. He was 
on top of the world. It must be a 
sign; his luck had turned. He had 
been chosen and now he would see 
what he was made of. 

He tried to explain it to Jean. She 
didn’t really seem to take it aboard. 
But in his euphoria he felt he could 
cope with anything. And the train- 
ing was fascinating . 

“I’m so glad you’re enjoying it, 
dear,’’ she said. 

“I wish you had more to enjoy,’’ 
he said generously expansive. 
“You’re always doing some damn 
thing for Momma.” 

“Well, she’s my mother after all. 
Besides, where else could she go?” 

Norman sighed. Unanswerable. 

He did try to be kind. But his 
mind had become sensitized to re- 
petitiveness. You only had to tell 
the black box once, and thereafter 
it would do or say the same thing 
over and over, or cause the same 
operation to be performed. While 
Labor was screaming its head off 
about human dignity, it was daily 
demonstrated that that particular 
quality was industrially unneces- 



sary. He listened with new ears to 
the evening’s conversation. 

“Don’t you want any cutlets, 
Momma? I tried a new recipe.” 

“You young people just don’t 
understand the distress I’m having 
with mv bowels.” 

“Did you take your medicine 
today?” 

“You just don’t understand the 
distress I’m having.” 

“Gee, I’m sorry, Momma. I 
made it special, no onions or any- 
thing.” 

“There’s nothing left for me but 
my family. I have to depend on you 
for everything, dear. And Nor- 
man.” 

“Well, would you like some 
milk?” 

“Oh, never mind about me. I’ll 
get along somehow.” 

Norman got the milk. 

“I just don’t seem to have any 
appetite.” Jean placed a bowl of 
custard in front of Momma. 

“How was the office, dear?” 

“Pretty good. I may have to do 
some traveling soon. I might even 
be transferred. There aren’t many 
of us who know how to handle these 
things. Did I tell you . .” 

A plaintive “Why does everything 
have to happen to me?” interrupted 
him. 

“But Momma,” said Jean. 
“Nothing is happening to you. It’s 
happening to Norman, and he only 
said maybe.” 

“There’s nothing left for me but 
my family,” said Momma tearfully.

“I have to depend on you for every- 
thing, dear. And Norman.” 

The baleful look accompanying 
this speech penetrated Norman’s 
concentration. ‘‘Why, she doesn’t 
like me either!” he thought. He had 
assumed that her gratitude, though 
ill-expressed, was real. 

Jean said, “Well, we’re right 
here. Momma.” 

‘‘I don’t think you really care if 
I’m here or if I’m dead. Well, I 
won’t be around much longer.” 

‘‘Oh, Momma, don’t talk like 
that.” 

“I have nothing to look forward 
to, that’s all.” 

‘‘Where might you go, Nor- 

? » <i 

He replied absently, “Oh, I don’t 
know yet. Possibly California, may- 
be only Delaware. Depends.” 
“When you are as decrepit as I 
am you have to keep busy with 
something or you can’t STAND it.” 
“I’ll play cards with you later. 
Momma.” Jean cleared the table, 
loaded the dishwasher. Norman re- 
mained in the dining room, his 
notebook open. He glanced at his 
mother-in-law. A bright eye stared 
around the handkerchief, instantly 
resuming its pathos as he looked 
up. Jean came in, opened a deck of 
cards, dealt. Norman unfolded the 
evening paper. Habib was coming 
after all; the headlines were “oil 

DEAL MAY GO THROUGH”: “NEW 
HOPE FOR THE FUEL CRISIS”; the 

editorial was eloquent on the sub- 
ject of warm winters. He wondered 



if he might catch a glimpse of the 
Arab’s car on Constitution Avenue. 
They needed oil now, not next year 
when the Alaskan pipeline might 
be finished. 

The silence was punctuated by 
sniffs. 

“It’s not as if I were any trouble 
to you. I stay in my little room up- 
stairs and don’t bother you at all.” 

Jean sighed gently. “Your deal, 
Momma.” 

Later, in their bedroom, he said, 
“Jean, there’ll be a banquet affair 
at the end of this course. Full dress 
and all. Want to go?” 

“What about Momma?” 

“Oh, for God’s sake, she’s only 
sixty-five and perfectly healthy.” 

“1 know, but I’d worry. And be- 
sides, we’d never hear the end of 
it.” 

Norman muttered, “She sure has 
it made, the old — ” Louder, “You 
plan to come along and we’ll get 
someone in.” 

“I’d like that.” 

“I’ll tell her tomorrow.” He felt 
pretty good. It’s amazing what a 
little self confidence will do for a 
man, he thought. All this time I’ve 
been afraid . 

Carefully, he explained that 
someone would be in to keep her 
company. Carefully, he pointed 
out that Jean hadn’t had a night 
out for months. Nevertheless . 

“I don’t think you care if I’m 
here or if I’m dead. Well, I won’t 
be around much longer . there’s 
nothing left for me but my family. I 



130 



GALAXY 




have to depend on you for every- 
thing, dear. And Norman. Oh, why 
does everything have to happen to 
me?” 

Norman said, slowly and care- 
fully and very clearly, “We are 
going out, Momma. On the tenth 
of October. Four weeks from Fri- 
day. Period.” 

He opened the paper with a 
snap. Jean offered milk, custard 
and cards to no avail. Momma 
stomped off upstairs for the first 
time that Norman could remember. 

He smiled in silent triumph. His 
eye lit on an elaborate advertise- 
ment. 

DO YOU REMEMBER NANNIE? 

HAVE A NIGHT OUT WITH NO 
WORRIES 

SHE LIVES IN — NEEDS NO ROOM 
OF HER OWN! 

COSTS ONLY PENNIES IN ELEC- 
TRICITY 

Robodqlls, INC. 

SEND US A PORTRAIT OF GRANNIE 

WE GUARANTEE TO MATCH It! 

He stared at it for a long, long time. 

Of course he sent for the bro- 
chure. Apparently this company 
had seized on the colloids before 
anyone else and, playing on the 
yearning of a democratic people for 
servants, had incorporated it into 
lifelike dolls programmed to tend 
babies, buttle, clean, wait on 
tables. Nannies were complicated; 
they had to respond to visual cues, 
make decisions as to whether feed- 
ing or changing was wanted, do 
highly controlled lifting. These of 



course really needed only the most 
minimal form, but mothers would 
never accept raw machinery as 
babysitters; hence the Nannie. The 
price was colossal. Norman sent for 
one on approval. He enclosed 
several photographs of Momma. 

When the package arrived — at 
the office — he unpacked it in pri- 
vate during lunch hour. It was as 
advertised; a perfect replica of his 
mother-in-law. They had even cap- 
tured the malicious glitter of her 
black eyes. He wondered why he 
hesitated to show it to Jean; it 
would be an ideal companion for 
Momma on the upcoming, and god 
willing, many other, nights out. 
Nothing pleased Momma more 
than Momma; she ought to be de- 
lighted. 

But he did not take it home. In- 
stead he opened the sealed mechan- 
ism, thus committing himself to 
interminable payments, and re- 
moved its voice-response spool. On 
the way home he bought a tape- 
recorder. This he did show Jean. 
And Momma. 

After the usual “Oh, I don’t 
want to . .” and “Do I sound like 
THAT?” “Come on, say any- 
thing . .” and the false starts, af- 
fected voices and all the fussing, at 
least he was able to leave it on for 
an evening without anybody caring. 
The usual conversational arab- 
esques resumed their normal 
course. 

“Do you want some meat, 
Momma?”

“You young people just can’t 
understand the distress I’m having 
with my bowels. I just don’t seem to 
have any appetite.” 

“Would you like some pudding?” 
“Never mind about me. I’ll get 
along somehow.” 

Norman listened, and recorded. 
In the office he fiddled with the 
tape recorder and the voice-re- 
sponse spools, and managed to get 
all ten of Momma’s lines of dia- 
logue on the spool in random order. 
He put them on several times, vary- 
ing the sequence, enough to play 
for three-hour intervals. It was just 
like having Momma at the office. 
For some reason this amused him. 
He made the doll walk around, 
carried on long conversations with 
it in which he bombarded it with all 
his stored-up answers, arranged it 
to take in a certain amount of 
food — which of course would have 
to be emptied when no one was 
looking. Mostly it just sat and 
whined its lines. He still didn’t take 
it home. 

One night Jean was dressed in 
her hat and coat when he came in. 

“Oh, Norman, Mrs. Judd is 
having the baby, Mr. Judd is out of 
town and she can’t get anybody to 
mind the kids. I have to go help 
out. Can you cope with Momma? 
Just tonight?” 

Sure that his new strength was 
up to an evening with his mother- 
in-law Norman assured her that all 
would be well. “I’ll do dinner and 
all,” he promised. “Don’t worry.” 



“I may not get back till morn- 
ing,’’ Jean warned him. “God 
knows when Mr. J. will get home.” 

“Don’t worry. Go do your good 
deed,” said Norman. 

“Dinner’s in the oven, anyway,” 
she said and dashed distracted out 
into the evening. 

“Well, Momma,” said Norman 
cheerfully. “We’re on our own, 
eh?” 

"It’s not as if I were any trouble 
to you,” she said flatly. “I stay in 
my little room and don’t bother you 
at all.” 

"How about a little supper?” He 
carefully removed the casserole. 

“I just don’t seem to have any 
appetite.” 

“You are gracious, aren’t you?” 
said Norman. 

“There’s nothing left for me but 
my family. I have to depend on you, 
dear, for everything.” 

The evening wore on and on. He 
found himself less patient than he 
had expected. Even the reminis- 
cence of all the backtalk he was 
giving the doll was of less suste- 
nance than he had hoped. He 
found his control slipping badly. 

“When you are as decrepit as I 
am you have to keep busy or you 
can’t STAND it,” she began. 

“Busy at what?” roared Nor- 
man. "You don’t do a damn thing, 
you let Jean wait on you all the 
time, and as for decrepit there’s not 
a thing wrong with you.” 

Shocked, Momma opened her 
mouth. She suddenly seemed to re- 



132

collect that Jean was absent, and 
cried, “Oh, why does everything 
have to happen to me?” 

“And nothing happens to you at 
all. You have happened to us and 
happened to us and happened to 
us, and you are just about ruining 
any life we might have had ...” 
But she had flounced off up to 
her room. Just in time, thought 
Norman. 1 might have ... I might 
have ... he sat down to think 
about what he might have. 

Jean called in the morning. She 
would be home in time to see to 
Momma. Mr. Judd had arrived. 
Norman went to work with a good 
deal on his mind. He hoped Jean 
wouldn’t have to go out again. 

But three days later, on the third 
of October, Mrs. Judd was still in 
the hospital, Mr. Judd fell and 
broke his leg, and the kids couldn’t 
get a train for Grandma’s until late 
the next morning. Jean packed her 
overnight bag and swooped off. 

This time, Norman came home 
with his large package. 

“Momma, I’d like you to meet 
somebody,” he called from the bed- 
room, after a while. 

Momma came in and shrieked. 
Norman watched with satisfaction 
as she took in the details of the doll. 
It must be like looking into a 
mirror. He remembered that the 
mirror reverses the face; perhaps it 
was even more disconcerting to see 
one’s image straight. Or would it be 
the same? . Except that the doll 
did not echo Momma’s gestures of 



dismay. 

“Why does everything have to 
happen to me?” said the doll. 

Momma toppled over in a faint. 
Alas, it was, it transpired, a fatal 
attack. 

Norman was nonplused. He had 
not expected quite so — final a re- 
action. He went downstairs to think 
it over. He would have to call the 
doctor, the police, the undertakers; 
he would have to explain. They 
would find the doll. They would 
think him mad. 

He’d better have a drink; it 
might help to clear his mind. He 
poured a good stiff whisky and sat 
down in the easy chair. It wasn’t as 
if he were about to grieve; this 
would be a relief. Momma was go- 
ing to leave them everything, wasn’t 
she? Jean had said there wasn’t 
much, but at least she would stop 
costing so much. But nothing would 
matter if they took him away . 

Perhaps another drink. His mind 
seemed to be going in circles . 
Upstairs there were two Mom- 
mas ... He topped up his glass. 

After a while it didn’t seem so 
bad. Nobody could fault his inten- 
tions, could they? Jean would . 
oops. He hadn’t told her about the 
robot. She would naturally be upset 
about her mother. She would ask 
him how come he had brought it 
home the night she was out. 

By the time the bottle was half 
empty, he had acquired the courage 
to go, perhaps not exactly walking, 
back upstairs. The doll was still 



FAMILY PROGRAM 



133 




sitting in the chair where he had 
left it. 

“You young people just don’t 
understand the distress I’m having 
with my bowels.” 

On the floor lay . yes. He 
looked at it for some time deep in 
thought. If he could get rid of that, 
Jean would never know. He could 
leave the doll in Momma’s place. 
Would she know? He had never 
heard what they said to each other 
during the day ... He reached for 
the thing on the floor. His eyes said 
it was nearer than it seemed to be. 
He knelt down and groped. Cold. I 
must have been drink — I mean 
thinking a long time, he thought. 
He stared at the body again. What 
can one do with a body? If, that is, 
one does not want to call attention 
to it. He wished he had read more 
detective stories. He understood 
that this form of literature was 
filled with ingenious methods of 
disposal. He supposed bitterly that 
there wouldn’t even be one in the 
house. Trust Momma to be unco- 
operative, even to her taste in read- 
ing. Mad scientists had bubbling 
vats of acid handily about, he re- 
called. Perhaps he was a mad scien- 
tist, but unfortunately he was not 
properly equipped. He shook his 
head sadly. All his life they had not 
appreciated him; now at this cru- 
cial moment he didn’t even have 
any vats of acid. 

Regretfully he abandoned this 
line of reasoning. He could dis- 
member the thing with an axe and 



put it in a public sanitation facility, 
if he had an axe. This suggested 
journalism; the phrase “appre- 
hended” came to mind. That was 
what he wanted to avoid. Any fur- 
ther apprehension could be su- 
perfluous. 

Could he bury it in the back 
yard? He eyed the corpse doubt- 
fully. He thought not. And there 
were the neighbors . 

The doll said, “I just don’t seem 
to have any appetite.” 

He stumbled over and switched it 
off. He had now switched off all the 
Mommas. That called for a drink. 
He went downstairs again and saw 
to it. 

He made his way uncertainly up 
the stairs again. A powerful convic- 
tion that the difficulties were more 
amenable to solution downstairs 
than up here swept over him. He 
would adjourn the conference to 
the sitting room. 

“One step at a time,” he said. 
The ambiguity struck him as ex- 
quisitely funny. He pulled the body 
by the arm and staggered unevenly 
over the door sill. “Bump-bump- 
bump, here comes Momma down 
the stairs . .” he murmured. 
“Sometimes she thinks there’s an- 
other way to . .” Halfway down 
he stopped. Time for a little think. 
There wasn’t much in that bottle. 
Depression times, everyone was 
giving less. Pay for a full fifth, and 
what do you get? A fourth. No, a 
sixth. He propped Momma against 
the wall and sat down on the land- 



134 



GALAXY 




ing, closing his eyes for a moment. 
Now, where was he? Oh, yes, 
getting Momma downstairs. He 
clambered back up and went into 
the bedroom. Yes, there she was. 
Slightly haunted by a nagging sense 
of deja-vu. he picked her up, threw 
her limply over his shoulder, and 
reeling from wall to wall of the cor- 
fidot achieved the staircase. He 
negotiated the top step, tripped, 
and Momma tumbled off his lurch- 
ing shoulder and rolled to the land- 
ing. 

Norman blinked. He seemed to 
be involved with a sea of Mommas. 
One, two, three ... no more 
whisky for him tonight. There was 
one old lady sitting placidly against 
the wall and another old lady . 
or were there two? sitting placidly 
against the banisters . 

It all came back to him. Of 
course, the doll. He picked his way 
down to the two lay figures, cling- 
ing to the railing. 

“Well, Ladies, we must get on.” 

There was no response. How like 
them. 

“Come, come,” he said, very 
courteously. “Do shake a leg. We 
are all going downstairs now and 
have a little drink.” 

Reclining indolently, the Mom- 
mas ignored him. He seized the one 
on the left by the shoulders and 
hauled her to her feet. 

“Come on" he said, standing 
her up; but as soon as he let go she 
slithered to the floor again. 

The other one did the same. 



He lay them side by side along 
the edges of the steps, feet pointing 
downwards. One by one he pulled 
them by their little black-shod feet. 

Eventually he got them propped 
up side by side on the sofa. Wiping 
his dewy forehead on his sleeve, he 
rooted about in the cabinet and 
finally unearthed a small bottle of 
brandy. He offered first one and 
then the other the glass, to which 
neither paid the slightest attention. 

He was hurt. “After all this 
trouble,” he said reproachfully, 
“the least you could do is join me in 
a snifter.” Weil, since they refused 
to be sociable, he would have all the 
more. 

He lit a cigarette and thought the 
matter over. 

. One of these is a corpse and 
the other a very expensive robot. 
One of them has fallen down the 
stairs. If it was the corpse it hardly 
matters. If it was the doll, it may 
have been damaged. Then it cannot 
be returned even if I replaced its 
original voice spools, and no matter 
what I will have to pay for it. There- 
fore I had better check the doll and 
see . 

My, how logically the brain 
worked when encouraged. He took 
a minute off for a silent tribute to 
the wonder of human conscious- 
ness. 

“But there is a time for thinking 
and time for doing. First we must 
establish which of you is the real 
Mrs. Frebish.” 

He rolled up his damp shirt-

sleeves, drew sustaining smoke into 
his lungs, and opened, the dress of 
the Momma on his right. Memories 
of happier occasions upon which he 
had opened the dresses of ladies 
seated on this very sofa flitted 
through his mind. Ah, those had 
been the days . when mother-in- 
law jokes were still funny . Back 
to business. Under the armpit he 
located the spring that opened the 
body cavity wherein he had passed 
so many entertaining hours with 
screwdriver and pliers. Yes. This 
one was the doll. The other was 
therefore the — er — Problem. 

You wouldn’t think it would be 
difficult to dispose of so small an 
object, would you. His mind was a 
desert of planlessness. 

He paced. He lit another ciga- 
rette. He had another drop of the 
brandy, hoping for a recurrence of 
that moment of lucidity that had 
visited him so long ago. 

As an answer to prayer, it came. 
He was a privileged employee with 
security clearance, wasn’t he? He 
had a private telephone connection 
to the Big C, didn’t he? He even 
had an emergency override code, 
and this was for damn sure an 
emergency. The Big C, crammed to 
the gills with all the information in 
the world, would save him; he 
loped to the hall phone. Fifteen 
digits to be dialed very carefully. 
Thank god he knew them by heart, 
the first twelve were his social 
security number. Lots of room for 
a slip in the last three, though . 



but there was the signal. He spoke 
the word that would compel the 
thing to speak English. Then — 
“Hello there.’’ 

“Good eve-ning, sir.’’ 

“Er ... is it?’’ said Norman, 
momentarily shaken by the pleas- 
ant baritone, which sounded like 
somebody. 

“The temp-er-a-ture is 18°, hu- 
mid-it-y 40 %, wind vel-oc-it-y 
10 . .’’ 

Norman cut off this delightful 
weather report in midspate. 
“Thanks.” 

“Not at all.” 

The thing had better manners 
than anyone at the office. Briefly 
Norman wondered who had record- 
ed its responses ... No. But that 
Harvard accent . 

“I wonder if you can help me.” 
“What is the na-ture of your 
prob-lem?” 

“1 seem to have this body.” 

“It is a com-mon phe-nom-e- 
non." 

“I mean somebody else’s.” 

“Do you mean you have trans- 
ferred your con-scious-ness in-to a- 
noth-er bod-y than your own?” 
“No, no!” Where would a com- 
puter get a notion like that? “I 
mean a dead body.” 

“The cus-tom-ar-y pro-ced-ure is 
to call the po-lice and the med-i-cal 
ex-am-in-er for your count-y.” 
“Yes, but I’d rather not. For rea- 
sons I don't care to discuss. How 
can 1 get rid of it?” 

The smooth, courteous voice 



136 



GALAXY 




ceased momentarily. Had it no 
answer? Oh, god, it would be re- 
cording this chat as it recorded 
everything. He must be sure to 
erase it, and that it was irretriev- 
ably gone. 

“There is a cus-tom of bur-i-al.” 

“Wont do.” 

“Al-ter-na-tive-ly man-y per-sons 
opt for cre-ma-tion.” 

Norman thought rapidly. The in- 
cinerator? The neighbors again. 
The furnace was oil-tired and had 
an opening about six inches square. 
Set the house afire? Every feeling 
revolted. 

“How?” 

“You could con-suit the cre-mat- 
or-i-um.” 

“No, no, they would bring in the 
police and all that. Try again!” 

“Do you have an o-ven?” 

The implications made his blood 
run cold. He took a largish gulp 
from the glass he seemed to be 
holding. This discussion was be- 
coming entirely too macabre. 

“Never mind,” he said, and 
hung up. 

He started toward what he took 
to be the sitting room door. Eras- 
ing! He had forgotten to cancel the 
recording! Hastily, he dialed again. 
This time there was a different 
voice. 

“Yeah?” 

“927-31-7253-444-934 Cancel 
program recorded from 2018 hours 
through, um, 2032,” said Norman 
clearly. 



“927-31-7253-444-934 Cancel 
program recorded between 2018 
hours and 2032,” he said very 
slowly and distinctly. 

“Whaddaya some kyna nut?” 
said the voice, slamming down the 
receiver. 

Sweating, he tried again. This 
time he did get the pleasant bari- 
tone. The Big C acknowledged the 
erasure, and thereafter emitted 
only silence when he asked for a 
replay. 

Feeling rather pleased with re- 
membering to cover his tracks, he 
started again for the living room. 
His feet were behaving oddly; the 
left kept heading toward the kit- 
chen, while the right appeared to 
desire nothing more than a hasty 
exit from the front door. It took 
considerable sustained effort to get 
them both pointed in the right di- 
rection. 

When he had negotiated the 
carpet he raised his eyes from his 
recalcitrant extremities. The two 
Mommas were still there. One, 
two. Between them on the central 
cushion of the sofa there had ap- 
peared a Hole. 

Norman rubbed his eyes. It was 
still there. Growing. 

“I don’t remember that,” he 
said. He drew nearer and peered at 
it. Something was eating the 
cushion from the inside. The Hole 
grew deeper as he stared, the edges 
of the shiny upholstery turning 
brown and crisp. Whatever it was 
was hungry. 



FAMILY PROGRAM 



137 




His cigarette! He had dropped it 
somewhere when he went to the 
phone. Fascinated, he sat down on 
the coffee table and refilled his 
glass. The Hole went on growing. 
The cushion was now merely a rim, 
like a square tire. A very small 
thread of smoke had appeared. 

“I am having a Fire,” he thought 
foggily. There was something one 
ought to do when having a Fire . 
what was it? He looked around the 
room, hoping for a clue. Ah! The 
shades on the windows were up! 
The neighbors would see that he 
was on fire. He would have to take 
steps about that; he stumbled to 
the window and pulled down the 
blind. That would take care of 
them. 

Solemnly he drank a toast to the 
strangeness of Life, and then pour- 
ed the little remaining in his glass 
into the Hole. Pretty blue flames 
leapt out of it. Lovely. Oh, yes, 
water, not alcohol. He needed the 
alcohol more than it did. He bore 
his empty glass unsteadily to the 
kitchen, allowing his kitchen- 
oriented foot its head. He turned on 
the tap and meditatively filled the 
glass, rinsing it carefully. Balanc- 
ing it with the utmost attention he 
wandered back to the sofa. Yes, it 
was certainly still burning. He 
poured the water in. It hissed. Very 
satisfactory. First visuals, now 
sound effects. 

Perhaps it would speak again. 
He went back to the kitchen. An- 
other brandy-glassful followed the 



first. Terrific! And the Hole 
stopped expanding. He put his 
hand into it. Something bit him. 
More water . 

After the fifth libation he felt 
satisfied that his Fire was out. He 
could now pull up the blinds. And 
get back to his Problem. 

He contemplated the Mommas. 
Fortunately he had left the chest 
plate open on the robot. It was the 
other one, then . 

Wisps of smoke seemed to be 
everywhere. Surely he had not lit 
another cigarette? He thought, 
deeply. A glimmering of light hov- 
ered on the outer edge of aware- 
ness . yes. It appeared that the 
garments of the Problem had too 
closely proximated the Hole. Per- 
haps the cremation question would 
solve itself without his intervention. 
Perhaps if he went to sleep now, the 
whole evening would turn out to be 
a bad dream. In the morning it 
would be all right. The more he 
thought about that the better he 
liked it. He pulled the shades 
again, just in case. 

There wasn’t much left in the 
brandy bottle. He might as well 
finish it up, first. He put some in 
the glass and some unintentionally 
on the table, and sat down to 
watch. It would be a shame not to 
know how the dream came out. 

Maybe he had better pour some 
more water on it. He looked around 
for the glass. He’d had it a minute 
ago. Oh. Brandy in it now. Well, 
that was easily solved. He emptied 



138

it and went to fetch some water. 
Then he sat comfortably on the 
coffee table and lit a cigarette. 

It was really becoming quite cre- 
puscular. Little promontories of 
emptiness edged with red light 
flickered over the clothing of the 
Problem. At the back of his mind 
there was something lurking that 
he refused to recognize. It had 
something to do with the oven, and 
there was a horror that would come 
of this . a smell. There would be 
a smell. There was a smell. Burning 
hair? Nylon? Very nasty; he didn’t 
want to think about whatever was 
coming next ... he fought back 
the intrusive, unidentifiable antici- 
pation . There definitely was a 
smell. Like the handle of a sauce- 
pan left too long on the stove, like 
the old bathroom cup that had 
fallen into the incinerator . 
plastic . PLASTIC? 

He dashed the cold water over 
the shimmering, smoke-shrouded 
figure. He stumbled to the kitchen, 
filled a bowl and threw it at the 
thing. 

Something had given way. The 
chest cavity of the Problem had 
sprung open, revealing a familiar 
pattern of wiring, microsynchs and 
black boxery. 

He backed off, muttering. He 
seized the empty brandy bottle and 
upended it in his mouth. Suddenly 
he was cold sober. 

The two robodolls, one rather 
damaged, stared at him over their 
opened chests. 



“I have such distress in my 
bowels,” said a familiar voice. 

“I think I’ve gone mad,” said 
Norman conversationally, to him- 
self. Then, ‘‘this is one lousy 
dream.” He prodded the undam- 
aged doll tentatively. 

‘‘It’s not as if I were any trouble 
to you,” it said. 

“When you are as decrepit as I 
am you have to keep busy with 
something or you can’t STAND it,” 
said the scorched one, with a tra- 
vesty of a smile on its mutilated 
face. It closed its chest and rose to 
its feet. 

“I just don’t seem to have any 
appetite,” said the other, closing its 
chest and rising to its feet. 

The hair on Norman’s neck 
bristled. He backed away. How did 
you turn them off? He had turned 
them off — hadn’t he? He couldn’t 
remember . Side by side the 
dolls began moving toward him. 

“I don’t think sometimes you 
care if I’m here or if I’m dead . .” 

“Well, I won’t be around much 
longer . , .” 

Bright-eyed, the Mommas 
marched sedately after him as he 
tied. 

The light tap-tapping of little old 
ladies’ shoes persisted, up the 
stairs, along the corridor ... he 
locked the bedroom door and push- 
ed a chair under it. 

Where had it come from? How 
long . Where was . JEAN! 
His head was hammering. 

“Why does everything have to

happen to me?” fluted the voices in 
chorus, outside the bedroom door. 

”1 have nothing to look forward 
to, that’s all.” 

“You know I’ll leave you every- 
thing.” 

The sound of cackling laughter 
echoed and re-echoed chillingly. He 
had recorded no laughter on that 
tape . the handle of the door 
turned, resisted and suddenly spun 
loosely. The door scraped open. 

Duralloy framework; Synthasteel 
muscles; mere flesh and blood far 
too weak to oppose such strength. 
They tripped in unison over the 
doorsill, the door drooping on 
broken hinges; laced black shoes 
marching over the roses of the 
carpet, each step bringing them 
nearer to the corner where Norman 
cowered against the wall, sobbing 
with terror. 

“There’s nothing left for me but 
my family ...” 

“1 have to depend on you for 
everything, dear ...” whined the 
tapes. 

Everything went black. 

* * * 

T he quality of the darkness 
gradually changed. He was 
probably dead. Dragging his con- 
sciousness partly back from the 
hole into which it had escaped, he 
became aware that the darkness 
was actual. He wasn’t dead. Very 
slowly and in mortal panic he felt 
himself for injuries. He was in bed. 



naked . No, not naked. Some- 
thing had been fastened on him 
with safety pins. Safety pins? . 
Nannies. He had changed the 
voices; he hadn’t meddled with the 
actions. He had cried and they had 
changed him and put him to bed. 

He began to laugh, and laugh, 
and laugh . 

* * * 

When a rather shaken Jean came 
to visit him at St. Elizabeth’s, he 
stared at her wildly, and said only, 
“Go away. I don’t know you. Don’t 
tell me what you are, I don’t want 
to know.” 

She couldn’t even interest him in 
the big news, although she left the 
newspaper with the headlines “oil

TELEVISION: NEVER-NEVER LAND 
AND CLARKE’S THIRD LAW 






DICK HOAGLAND 



G ene roddenberry once told a 
group of us assembled for 
breakfast at New York’s Explorers’ 
Club, “Television’s sole reason for 
existence is to sell something, any- 
thing!” 

And this writer, several years 
later, told another group, this time 
an assembly of NASA types, science 
fiction writers, and social scientists 
gathered for an Information Inter- 
actions Conference, “As of now in 
the United States, about 90% of 
everybody gets about 90% of every- 
thing (information) through tele- 
vision!” 

Combining these two assessments 
of the largest mass medium in the 
history of Man, one arrives at the 
inescapable conclusion that to be 
the Delphic oracle to so many, tele- 



vision must have stumbled upon 
some magic formula. And it has. It 
is called, by those in the trade, the 
LCD — Lowest Common Denomi- 
nator. 

And just what, pray tell, do 25 
million people (a nominally re- 
spectable prime-time audience) 
have in common, one with the 
other? My answer to this probably 
cannot be printed upon these 
august pages, but I’ll give you a 
hint. Mr. Whipple occasionally 
succumbs to temptation over it. 

It is not my purpose here to assail 
television programming, its banal- 
ity, its superfluity, or its constant 
interruptions by “a word from our 
sponsor.” That has been accom- 
plished elsewhere and by critics 
better qualified, at least in the area 



141 




of “mainstream television.” My ob- 
jective is to wield an electron beam 
or two and direct them at a little 
recognized subtlety of broadcast 
communication and entertainment: 
Television, science fiction, and 
reality. In the context of this maga- 
zine, Reality I interpret to mean 
anything having to do with science, 
technology, and future-cum-pres- 
ent. That’s where television is most 
interesting — and most dangerous! 

Television as a medium is quite 
unlike any other invented for the 
communication of information or 
misinformation. Unlike books or 
even radio, little imagination is re- 
quired to be totally convinced of a 
given reality presented over “the 
tube.” And, unlike movies which 
require a conscious effort to par- 
take of (at least a trip to the 
theatre), TV is an omnipresent 
commodity, so universal that its 
very ubiquity is taken for granted. 
Television IS — in almost every liv- 
ingroom, bar, train station, air- 
port, university commons, or loca- 
tion where there is human traffic. It 
is a universal eye upon the world, 
an ever present commentator upon 
all that is living or unfolding. If it 
isn’t on television, it doesn’t exist. 
It is Life reduced to a 19-inch 
screen (measured diagonally, of 
course), and conveniently placed 
Everywhere. 

It used to be a favorite pet peeve 
of mine (alongside my pet pere- 
grine) that educators would speak 
glowingly of the educational value 



of National Educational Television. 
Their idea of “educational” tele- 
vision was to take one bona fide ex^ 
pert and place before one expen- 
sive-looking blue curtain. Add a 
blackboard and, perhaps, a point- 
er to complete the concept (theirs 
and, obviously, the producer’s) of 
how to educate with a television set. 
The fact that it produced deadly- 
dull television programming and 
set back the idea of television as an 
educational adjunct by about 
twenty years seems to have escaped 
their attention. 

Out of this inept beginning to the 
use of TV as an educational device, 
grew a pervasive feeling that ETV 
had to be dull or it wasn’t edu- 
cating! It wasn’t until the beginning 
of the Nixon Administration and 
the advent of a rather innovative 
head of HEW, Robert Finch, that a 
new perspective, voiced by a na- 
tional leader in education publicly 
proclaimed what many people had 
privately long been aware of: Any 
television educates — noneducation- 
al TV (then) best of all — by pro- 
viding a simulated reality which 
allows the viewer to identify, role- 
play, and absorb. 

Mr. Finch compared the six 
hours of enforced boredom spent in 
many a classroom to the nine hours 
spent daily before and after school, 
and came to the inescapable con- 
clusion that children today are 
learning far more about the world 
through the random portrayal of 
TV than through the structured 



142 



GALAXY 




environment of formal education. 
What he did not add, however, was 
the fact that, on the average, adults 
watch far more television than their 
children! What are they learning? 
And, equally important, who’s 
teaching them? 

In a broad survey of the world’s 
religions, one finds a fascinating 
variety of names for the Creator: 
Jehovah, The Supreme Being, God, 
Allah, Tao, etc. Arthur Clarke 
once collected a significant number 
of these in a horrifying little work 
titled The Nine Billion Names of 
God. A group of monks (it seems) 
in an obscure monastery set high in 
the Himalayas (where else?) hire 
the services of an electronic com- 
puter to aid in the tabulation of all 
the known forms of address for the 
Deity. They succeeded, and in so 
doing, encountered a most unex- 
pected eventuality. For those who 
haven’t read this piece, I won’t di- 
vulge the ending except to say that I 
don’t think it would have worked. 
For nowhere, either in Clarke’s 
enumeration or that of the monks 
did 1 see the word Producer. And 
without it, the monks’ (and Ar- 
thur's) lists cannot be complete. 

P roducers are the gods of tele- 
vision. Nothing gets written, 
photographed, scripted, cast, shot, 
or aired without the expressed ap- 
proval of these obscure but su- 
premely powerful entities. A CBS 
producer, in my presence, once 
beat a telephone to death because 



an operations-man cut thirty sec- 
onds on the clock and removed our 
program from the air prematurely. 
Another producer, out of a per- 
sonal belief that living on the Moon 
was an impossibility, refused to air 
a guest whose technical authority 
and national standing would have 
given weight to the opposite per- 
spective: If gods are regarded as 
whimsical, arrogant, biased and, in 
the end, all-powerful Invisibilities, 
then television Producers stand fill 
the description. 

Talk about power! In what other 
profession can one man’s (or 
woman’s) concept of Reality be- 
come the model of thirty million 
other human beings? In what other 
profession can an entire Universe 
be controlled, from set to actors, 
from dialog to direction, and pre- 
senting through a medium tailor- 
made to convey the feeling of reality 
to so many — and from the safety 
(or sanctity?) of such anonymity! 
Quick — name the Producers of five 
of the leading prime-time network 
shows this evening. Now, name the 
Executive Producers! Not even the 
President of the United States has 
such power. 

A few years ago, John Campbell 
voiced a slight amendment to the 
familiar saw, “Power corrupts, ab- 
solute power corrupts absolutely.” 
John argued that it isn’t so much 
power that leads to corruption as it 
is immunity. A powerful individual 
whose very existence is unrecogniz- 
ed by all but a few is, by John’s 



FORUM 



143 




definition, corrupt. It was appar- 
ently a situation present in the 
White House and it is a situation 
present today in the never-never 
land of Television. 

Having laid this background, it 
is now time to examine some 
specific examples of the synergistic 
effect of television omniscience, 
producer omnipotence, and public 
ignorance. 

A few years ago, in an article 
dealing with science education in 
America, a science writer remarked 
that deliberate science instruction 
of the general public a la educa- 
tional TV was a dismal failure. 
“On the other hand,” he main- 
tained, “give me a good writer, the 
cooperation of the producer of the 
Beverly Hillbillies, and a fictitious 
trip by that national phenomenon 
to Brookhaven or Oak Ridge, and 
I'll teach thirty million people more 
about nuclear physics in one week 
than ‘ Discovery ’ has in ten years!” 

I don’t recall the Beverly Hill- 
billies ever visiting Brookhaven or 
(thank God) even an observatory. 
But, if they had, I am sure the 
script would have come out some- 
thing like this: 

granny: Jed, woudja lookit thet 
water heater! Kin ye imagine chop- 
pin’ enough wood fer that on a 
Saturday night?” 

jed: Granny, thet ain’t no water 
heater. The feller in the white 
coat . 

granny: You mean the funny 
doctor-feller with his prunes? 



jed: Yeah, that’s the one. He 
says thet ain’t no water heater atall. 
Thet’s an “accel-er-ator” . 

jethro: . Aw, Jed, he must be 
a foolin’. They cain’t be no accele- 
rator. 

jed: And why not? 
jethro: ‘Cause he says it shoots 
prunes, thet’s why. And besides, 
where’d they ever git a truck big 
enough fer an accelerator like thet? 

You get the idea. 

The problem, of course, is that if 
ever the “Hillbillies” had been set 
in a nuclear research laboratory, 
amid the huge coils of a proton ac- 
celerator, the last thing on the pro- 
ducer's mind would have been the 
enlightenment of the viewing audi- 
ence as to the workings, purpose, 
or excitement of high-energy phy- 
sics. It is even probable that the 
“acceleration of prunes” would 
have been taken quite seriously as a 
hilarious coincidence to be capi- 
talized upon, but certainly not ex- 
plained. 

“But,” I can hear you object, 
“the Beverly Hillbillies is not a 
show even remotely connected with 
science or technology. Of course, it 
wouldn’t have given an accurate 
portrayal of life in a national re- 
search institution. That is not its 
purpose. It is supposed to enter- 
tain, not educate!” 

Alas — my point, precisely. What 
my fictitious visit by Granny, Jed, 
et al. could have done for the image 



144 



GALAXY 




of serious science in one show, has 
been done, quite inadvertently, to 
everything from the city govern- 
ment of Beverly Hills to the arcane 
art of banking itself. The point is 
not that the Beverly Hillbillies are 
going to destroy the credibility of 
these institutions . .Ample public 
contact is available to provide feed- 
back to counter that TV image 
(something, incidentally, which 
would be lacking in a show laid at 
Oak Ridge). The point is that tele- 
vision, especially through entertain- 
ment, shapes our total vision of so- 
ciety at a level so subliminal that 
most of us aren’t even aware of it. 
Try driving through “beautiful 
downtown Burbank” without smil- 
ing the next time you’re in Southern 
California! 

Naturally, I am not really con- 
cerned by such obvious satire as the 
“Hillbillies.” It is the “serious” 
television shows, particularly those 
with an integral scientific or tech- 
nical foundation, which I believe 
we should examine. It is here, 
within the framework of a synthetic 
reality that I believe permanent 
damage to our society is being 
done. It is in this artificial Uni- 
verse, created by the Word of the 
Producer, at whose Right Hand 
sitteth the Science Consultant 
(sometimes), that I believe the 
public is losing its ability, feeble as 
it has always been, to tell the real 
from the unreal, the possible from 
the impossible, and the present 
from the future. We have entered 



the realm of Clarke’s Third Law: 
“Any sufficiently developed tech- 
nology is indistinguishable from 
magic.” And Producers are the 
magicians. 

In a civilization in which most 
participants have only the most dis- 
tant awareness of science, while, at 
the same time, science has almost 
totally prescribed their lives, the 
blurring of public reality when it 
comes to science or technology is 
not merely annoying; it is frighten- 
ing. Our society is basically divided 
by its schooling, into two cultures, 
according to Toynbee — the Sciences 
and the Humanities. The latter far 
outnumber the former, incidental- 
ly, in case you didn’t suspect. It is 
from the latter that most of the so- 
called “intelligent” television view- 
ers are drawn. It is also from this 
Humanities category that the over- 
whelming number of television pro- 
ducers springs. 

This division, which begins in 
High School and rapidly becomes 
more pronounced in college, affects 
all who pursue any degree of higher 
education. It means that, at the 
top, society is split perhaps 80-20% 
against any real ability to evaluate 
scientific authenticity on television. 
But that’s only the beginning. This 
top level is only about half of all 
television viewers, even in 1974. 
These citizens, with only a passing 
exposure to science (mostly in the 
form of a general science class) 
have virtually no foundation upon 
which to base a judgment of tech-

nical surroundings, props, or prem- 
ises of television entertainment. 
And it is in this vast sea of ignor- 
ance that the developing tsunami of 
television science fiction is build- 
ing. Producers have discovered, at 
last, the source of an infinity of 
plots — the Universe. 

Heaven help us. 

The following is, of necessity, in- 
complete. It is not in any particular 
order, nor is it catalogued accord- 
ing to network. All are equally 
guilty, although I keep remember- 
ing the story from CBS when 
Roddenberry got a turndown for 
Startrek with the line, “We already 
have a science-fiction series, very 
similar, really. Called Lost in Space 
or something, I believe.” It is 
merely a beginning. 

Over ten years ago, I was intro- 
duced to the term “Cyborg” by a 
rather skittish (I thought) NASA 
Spacemobile (remember those?) 
teacher as we were being led on a 
mini-tour of one of NASA’s chief 
contractors. What made me quite 
curious was the fact that, after ap- 
parently letting slip the fact that 
NASA was seriously considering 
such a thing, my guide refused to 
discuss the subject further. Need- 
less to say, upon my return to the 
museum where I was a curator, I 
called a few people in Washington 
and dug out the complete story. 

For those at my level of ignor- 
ance, a “Cyborg” is verbal short- 
hand for cybernetic organism. 



NASA’s idea was, simply, that 
there might be some environments 
which, in the future, it might want 
to explore where Man in his present 
form would be unfitted for on-site 
inspection. The solution, according 
to NASA thinking, was to marry 
the human brain with sufficient 
technology to carry that brain per- 
sonally into any such environment, 
be it the Moon’s surface or deep 
into the Jovian atmosphere. Thus 
the “Cyborg.” 

It was a very touchy subject. The 
spectre of “Frankenstein” lurks in 
the wings (thanks to that other set 
of gods, movie directors. But that’s 
another article.) If the public, in 
the days when we were terrified 
about killing one normal astronaut, 
had gotten hold of the idea that 
NASA was seriously considering re- 
moving the brain of a man and 
placing it within a machine . 

Now, it is 1973 (when the show 
begins) and, wonder of wonders, 
ABC has discovered the cyborg, 
NASA and all! Only, there have 
been a few changes, some good 
(thank our lucky stars) and some 
not so good. Enter “Steve Austin” 
astronaut and cyborg. 

The Six Million Dollar Man, as 
our hero is called, starts every show 
as a normal astronaut, veteran of a 
lunar mission (remember those?) 
and now pilot of an experimental 
reentry vehicle. So far, so good. In 
fact, too good. Remember those 
overwhelming numbers of TV 
watchers whose closest approach to 



146 



GALAXY 




science was a chapter on “Central 
Heating and Air Conditioning” in 
high school? They know we’ve sent 
men to the Moon (Walter told them 
so) and they know, now, that we’re 
not sending men to the moon any 
more, that NASA has put them to 
work flying other things, right? 
Therefore, as Steve Austin gets 
into trouble, turns his flying bath- 
tub upside down and tumbles 
across the screen (again, with 
actual NASA footage!), our unsus- 
pecting audience falls gently over 
the cliff between today and tomor- 
row as (off-camera, over quick cuts 
of an operating theatre and various 
pieces of sensational hardware — an 
arm, a leg, etc.), we hear a voice 
suspiciously like that of Steve’s 
future boss, Oscar Golman, intone 
authoritatively, “We have the tech- 
nology. We can rebuild him . 
Better than before . .” Cue music 
wind-up. Cut to Austin lifting a 
couple of tons, outrunning the 
Streamliner and, in general, look- 
ing very much as he did before. 
Freeze image over color diffraction 
pattern. Fade to first commercial. 

Why am I disturbed? 

Because Steve Austin is impos- 
sible. Now. And for many years to 
come. You know that, and I know 
that; but thirty million viewers who 
faithfully tune in every Friday night 
to see him put together just to 
knock over another building or 
derail another locomotive do not 
know that. It is irrelevant that the 
stories for this series seem to be re- 



jects from Hertz rent-a-plot. The 
heart of the matter is technology. 

Consider: Hundreds of thou- 
sands of veterans and an equal 
number of children live in the 
United States who are desperately 
in need of a breakthrough in pros- 
thetics. People wanting to lead use- 
ful, productive lives and unable to 
because of the state-of-the-art that 
is too primitive to be anything but a 
clumsy imitation of nature — and is 
too expensive even so. Research in 
this and virtually every other area 
of science has all but passed from 
the private into the public domain, 
both in the U.S. and elsewhere. If it 
is not government research, directly 
supported by the tax dollars of 200 
million “bosses,” it is research 
funded through public campaigns, 
such as the March of Dimes. Con- 
sider the problem generated by 
Steve Austin’s existence every week 
on network television, to a doctor 
working on advanced prosthetics. 
As he appeals to the public for in- 
creased monies to continue work in 
this urgently needed area of tech- 
nology, he is confronted by a popu- 
lar wisdom which sincerely believes 
that what he is attempting to ac- 
complish already exists! They see it 
every Friday night. On television. 

To the more skeptical viewer, the 
evidence that Steve Austin’s one 
bionic arm, two bionic legs, and 
one bionic eye (infrared, twenty-to- 
one zoom!) actually exist can be in- 
ferred from past history. NASA it- 
self has consistently tried to justify

147 




its own existence partially on its 
“fallout” of advanced technology in 
other areas of human need. It is 
common knowledge that “atomic” 
batteries exist — why, (for the really 
astute) they’re even powering that 
thing which just passed Jupiter, or 
something. Artificial arms and 
legs? Hell, you know what happens 
when you turn those NASA guys 
loose on a problem. After all, he is 
an astronaut, hero and all; NASA 
would certainly take care of its 
own, now wouldn’t it? 

Thus, through clever cloaking of 
the show’s basic premise in the im- 
mense credibility of NASA (“the 
difficult we do immediately; the im- 
possible takes a little longer”), we 
are left with a misapprehension: 
the military-industrial complex has 
developed a technology, with tax- 
payers’ money, vitally needed by so 
many thousands and yet, apparent- 
ly, unavailable to any save a select 
few' . 

Fantastic? Improbable? So was a 
flight to the moon. And Watergate. 
And they took place on television, 
too. 

ut let us go on. 

One of my favorite examples of 
this telecasting of Clarke’s Third 
Law' began with an offbeat creation 
called The Man From U.N.C.L.E. 
(followed, predictably, by The Girl 
From U.N. C.L.E. ) U.N.C.L.E. was 
an acronym standing for The Unit- 
ed Network Command for Law En- 
forcement, a passable addition to 



Interpol , Smersch, etc., at the 
height of the Bond era. 

The setting was contemporary — 
“Somewhere.” Somewhere in New 
York, Somewhere in London, 
Somewhere in the Arabian de- 
sert . UNCLE agents were the 
good guys, saving the world from 
the evil connivings of THRUSH 
(The Russians?). Week after week 
saw Napoleon Solo, hero with an 
unflappable air of cool detachment 
and Ilya Kuriakin, blond, Russian, 
and excitable, matching wits and 
hardware with the other side and 
winning. It was not the wits that 
worried me (or the lines, many of 
which were quite funny), but that 
hardware! It was the beginning of 
my foreboding over television's 
discovery of science fiction, al- 
though Asimov’s term “future fic- 
tion” would perhaps be more ap- 
propriate. In fact, one of the major 
reasons for my misgivings then — 
and now — was the implied “pre- 
sent” (not future and, certainly, 
not science fiction). TV Guide, that 
bible of the channel switchers, al- 
ways carefully labels these and 
other efforts which I will mention, 
as “adventure.” Science fiction? 
Certainly not! 

U.N.C.L.E.'s problem came 
down to one thing: communica- 

tions. Each week, amid a flurry of 
exotic weapons (dart guns, I’ll buy) 
and damnably noisy infrared snip- 
erscopes (after all, if it doesn’t 
w hine, how’re you going to know it 
isn’t a normal telescopic sight?),

Napoleon and Ilya chatted back 
and forth, sometimes separated by 
whole continents, in dungeons, in 
airplanes, in submarines and — 
and — in the middle of the Green- 
land icesheet, halfway around the 
world! And they never had battery 
problems. 

Not once, between Napoleon’s 
romantic escapades, Ilya’s propen- 
sity for getting into trouble, and 
Mr. Waverley's attempts to under- 
stand the situation from UNCLE 
headquarters back in New York 
over those incredible communica- 
tors was it ever explained how they 
worked. And in a city where a 
phone call across town was equiva- 
lent to electronic Russian roulette 
(sor-r-ry, the number you have 
reached will not exist until tomor- 
row . .), viewers began to wonder 
why this great invention, certainly 
far superior to anything the phone 
company was peddling, was being 
suppressed. 

They are still wondering. 

Alter the demise of UNCLE, tele- 
vision seemed to recede from the 
spectre of future/present hanky 
panky and delved headlong into re- 
writing the technological history of 
a different era — the Past. A name 
totally unsung in the pages of the 
growth of the United States (con- 
sidering how many inventions he 
whipped up in the nick of time to 
foil an equal number of malevolent 
plots to do us in, aided by equally 
ingenious technology) is that of 
Artemus Gordon, secret agent ex- 



traordinair. The name of the show 
may have been Wild Wild West, 
but the real star was the techno- 
logical razzle-dazzle dreamed up 
each week by Artie to get West out 
of one impossible situation after an- 
other. 

This constant rewrite of history 
would have been too much for one 
lone science writer to stand, had it 
not, eventually, been for a pure 
stroke of genius on the part of 
someone (anyone but the Producer, 
that is). 

In one of the later episodes, the 
indefatigable Dr. Lovelace, evil 
genius that he is, discovers a way 
into another dimension via a series 
of especially prepared works of art. 
Only at the end of the show are we 
show n that this alternate dimension 
is in actuality a series of alternate 
times. It then becomes obvious 
w here Artie and the enemies of the 
young United States are getting 
their miraculous post-1880’s tech- 
nology — from the future; perhaps, 
even, from television itself! 

By now television had discovered 
that spies, girls, gimmicks, and gall 
would stand even odds in beating 
the opposition in the frenetic rat- 
ings race.

This show, premiered initially as 
an NBC something Night at the 
Movies, was called, as a pilot, 
PROBE. In the series, this was 
changed to SEARCH. I will care- 



FORUM 



149 




fully refrain from the overwhelming 
temptation to term both titles apt 
description of a program looking 
for a reason to exist. 

Of all the miscarriages of tech- 
nical mayhem, I think Search (or 
Probe) was my favorite. For one 
thing, the sets reminded me of good 
old CBS Space Headquarters where 
1 and a few dozen other television 
people got all the Apollo guys safely 
to and from the Moon. For an- 
other, Search had as a very visible 
star a somewhat crusty character 
played by Burgess Meredith who, 
for all the world, reminded me of 
someone I had known or worked 
with . Then it hit me. The 
anonymous had become visible. 
Ego will out! Meredith — argumen- 
tative, demanding, didactic, and 
often unreasonable (“I don’t care if 
you’re hanging off a cliff, give me a 
scan of that beach, Murdoch, 
NOW!”) — was the alter ego of 
Search's Producer, whipping his 
team into line, driving toward an 
objective which would shower him 
with glory, sometimes at the ex- 
pense of his team, not to mention 
that poor guy hanging over the 
cliff. Meredith reminded me re- 
markably of my old producer. All 
that was missing was the cigar. 

The premise was simple. Probe 
Control, a sort of cross between 
NASA and the FBI, would hire out 
its services to investigate thefts or 
protect property from attempted 
theft by dispatching one or more 
Probe agents to the scene. Each 



Probe agent, through a simple sur- 
gical operation, was fitted with an 
implant, a device permitting verbal 
communication back to Probe Con- 
trol. So far, it all sounds like an 
improved version of UNCLE, com- 
plete with the new model com- 
municator worn inside the ear this 
year instead of concealed in your 
pen. But Probe (or Search) was 
only beginning. 

Search (or Probe) had beat the 
bandwidth problem. In addition to 
the implant, each Probe agent car- 
ried with him (or her; but I can’t 
seem to recall ever seeing a “her” 
Probe agent . .) a classy little de- 
vice cleverly called by the lab boys a 
“scanner.” A combination color 
television camera, infrared sensor 
(video), and vital signs detector 
(blood pressure, electrocardiagram, 
and Alpha, Beta, and Gamma 
wave sensor), this handy little 
gadget managed to transmit all this 
information back to Probe Control, 
yet was small enough to be worn as 
a ring when it wasn’t being worn as 
a pendant. Incidentally, since the 
majority of Probe fugitives were 
jewel thieves, the first thing to go 
whenever someone captured a 
Probe agent was (you guessed it), 
the scanner — that unobtrusive 100- 
carat bauble our hero was wearing 
inconspicuously. 

This development always seemed 
to put a severe crimp in the even- 
tempered Mr. Meredith who, pac- 
ing back and forth between the 
red-lit consoles of the Mission Con- 



150 



GALAXY 




trol-like set, would alternately 
reprimand the rest of the Probe 
team (which spent most of the show 
eavesdropping on our hero’s ro- 
mantic efforts via — you guessed 
it — the scanner) and our hero for 
getting the damn’ thing stolen, 
again. 

Hugh O’Brian as Probe agent 
Murdoch was forever getting into 
trouble as any good Probe agent 
was supposed to. Only, instead of 
letting Probe Control, via its com- 
puters, predictions, and interpreta- 
tion of data, scanner-relayed, tell 
him what to do, Murdoch would 
often as not go off on his own. 
Having decided that a particular 
Probe Control instruction was idi- 
otic, Murdoch would take off the 
scanner (a device somehow capable 
of beaming back to Control through 
solid rock, from the other side of 
the world, and in color), place it in 
his pocket and promptly cut off all 
signal from it and him until he 
chose to take it out again! 

An eighth of an inch of breast 
pocket material capable of doing 
what 8,000 miles and several giga- 
tons of granite were incapable of 
doing . All those weeks while 
our attention was on that scanner, 
it should have been on O’Brian’s 
suit! That stuff would have made a 
great reactor-shield! 

Again, nowhere was a mention 
made of how this hardware did 
what it did, although you got 
several quick shots of an AZUZA 
antenna on Ascension Island, im- 



plying, I guess, that satellites were 
somehow involved. 

I could go on. Oh, could I go on! 
But I believe you get the drift. Each 
of these shows, in its own right, 
could be very exciting, funny, and 
even educational. And that is my 
point. To untold millions of Ameri- 
cans, totally unsophisticated in the 
trap of Clarke’s Third Law, the in- 
tricate gadgets, technical tomfool- 
ery, and foundation of super- 
science have been taken at face 
value. The line between the capa- 
bility of our technology today and 
its promises for tomorrow is in the 
process of being irrevocably blurr- 
ed. It is all too easy to envision a 
scenario in the not-too-distant fu- 
ture, when some dedicated genius 
Finally succeeds in perfecting the in- 
credibly complex technical achieve- 
ment of matter transmission. The 
announcement, made on the eve- 
ning news, is greeted by hoots and 
catcalls from the inventor’s unseen 
audience. They have, after all, seen 
this before — on Star Trek. 

Another thought: the other day I 
was idly thinking about when all 
our greatest re-runs would hit the 
Far East markets — Hong Kong, 
Japan, Viet Nam, India, etc. — 
when a funny coincidence struck 
me. The re-runs of Search/Probe 
started in Hong Kong just about 
the time of Henry’s first check-in at 
the Peking-Hilton. 

What do you suppose “Clarke’s 
Third Law’’ looks like in Chi- 
nese . .? *

JERRY POURNELLE, Ph.D. 

BRAINPOWER: TWO REVOLUTIONS 



F or my sins I have (or will have 
by the time this is published) 
just finished a year as President of 
the Science Fiction Writers of 
America. Now that’s a great honor, 
and one I appreciate, but it’s also a 
lot of work. Unlike many writers’ 
organizations, SFWA does not have 
a staff of professional organization 
operators. It’s run by working 
writers, which is probably why it’s 
as effective as many larger and 
better-financed associations. It’s 
also why it burns up its officers. 

One of the tasks of the President 
is to organize the annual Nebula 
Awards Ceremony. As part of 
Nebula Day we have a big program, 
and this year I managed to inveigle 
a number of scientists and astro- 
nauts to come talk to us. It seemed 
like a good idea at the time: get 
men who had been to the Moon to 
talk about “what it’s like out 
there”; get important scientists to 
talk about “where do we go from 
here?” and have science fiction 



writers as the audience. 

It worked, but I didn’t get to 
hear much of the program. I was 
too busy keeping it running. Conse- 
quently, this isn’t a convention re- 
port. although I'll confess I’d hoped 
to get this month’s column as a fall- 
out of Nebula Day. 

I did notice one thing, though: 
the scientists were gloomier than 
the science fiction writers. Col. Al- 
fred Worden, Command Module 
Pilot of Apollo 15 and an active 
duty astronaut loaned to us by 
NASA for the day, read poetry: his 
own, about the end of Apollo. 

Dr. Harrison Brown, whose 
Challenge of Man’s Vast Future 
has influenced me for 15 years, 
gave a brilliant talk about problems 
of the developing world — and how 
unlikely we are to solve them. 

Even Bruce Murray, Cal Tech’s 
man in charge of the imaging ex- 
periments for the Mariner/Venus- 
Mercury probe, had some down- 
beat notes in his talk.

The theme was “where do we go 
from here?”, but there were times 
when it sounded a little like “Is 
there anywhere we can get from 
here?" 1 may exaggerate, but not a 
lot . 

The last key-note speaker was 
Robert Heinlein: and away went 
the gloom. Man will survive. Here, 
elsewhere; in this galaxy or another, 
on this planet or another or on no 
planet at all, we’re going to be 
around a long time. Mr. Heinlein 
has been writing that message for 
35 years, of course; and he hasn’t 
changed it. 

All very well, but why are science 
fiction writers more hopeful than 
scientists? And have we any right to 
lie hopeful? 

* * * 

Rick up any popular science 
magazine and you’ll see marvels, 
not only in the articles, but in the 
advertisements. Things science fic- 
tion writers didn’t dare put into 
stories taking place before the turn 
of the century are now for sale at 
prices we can afford. An endless 
stream of marvels, mostly available 
to the common man (at least the 
Western common man) pours out 
of technology’s cornucopia. 

But, some say, it can’t last: we’ll 
run out of energy. Yet there are 
many ways we can eliminate fossil 
fuels and still have all the non-pol- 
luting energy we’ll ever need. They 
only lake money and determination 



to have them. I’ve discussed a few 
before, but it’s worth reciting the 
list again: 

Geothermal power 
Power from warm water in the 
Tropics 

Solar screens on Earth 
Solar screens in space with trans- 
mission of power to Earth 
Windmills 
Fission 
Fusion. 

Of these, my favorite is the space- 
based system. Large solar screens 
intercept sunlight that would have 
fallen on Earth to begin with. We 
turn that light into electricity. 

There are several ways to do this. 
One is direct conversion with solar 
panels. There are increasingly more 
complex ways up to and including 
intercepting the light with alumi- 
nized mylar mirrors, focusing it 
onto sodium reservoirs, and using 
hot sodium to boil water for con- 
ventional turbines in orbit. 

We get the power down to Earth 
as micro-waves. I’ve seen designs 
for receiving antennae which run 
several miles on a side. They’re a 
grid of wire mesh with holes about 
a meter square, held up three or 
four meters from the ground. The 
energy flux is low enough that 
cattle can graze under the antenna. 

The elegant part about this sys- 
tem is that we’ve added no total 
energy to the Earth; we’ve merely 
had it arrive in a more useful form. 
We can even balance the total 
energy received: since our system is 



153 




not 100% efficient, we intercept a 
calculated amount of sunlight that 
would not have reached the Earth, 
enough to counter the energy we in- 
tercepted but didn’t send down. 

A solar screen orbital energy sys- 
tem would be a big project but of 
no greater magnitude than, say, 
covering North America with free- 
ways. For local situations we might 
also need fission or fusion plants, 
and some of the other alternatives 
such as warm water Tropical power 
plants; the point is, we have the 
technological capability to generate 
all the non-polluting power we 
want. 

That’s one revolution; let’s look 
at another. 

* * * 

As one event of Nebula Day, Cal 
l ech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
loaned us Dan Alderson, an astron- 
omer/programmer who has been 
mentioned before in this column. 
He brought along his Big Brain, the 
JPL computer that guides probes to 
distant planets and unscrambles 
the signals sent to Earth by the 
spacecraft. 

It’s quite a brain. It’s also indica- 
tive of one of the most fantastic 
stories of the decade. Back in 1965, 
Mariner 4 transmitted twenty-one 
pictures at a rate of 8 bits/second. 
A bit is, as most of you know, a 
two-valued signal: either a one or a 
zero. To send a picture you break it 
into dots, and there’s either dark or 



light at the dot. Each dot is a bit; it 
look a long time for Mariner to 
send back each photo. 

NASA then specified that 
Mariner 6 & 7 would have an im- 
proved capability: 256 bits/second. 
This wasn’t good enough for the 
JPL people and their associates at 
Boeing, TRW, etc., and Mariner 6 
llew with a “communications ex- 
Deri men t” capable of transmitting 
back data at 16 thousand bits/sec- 
ond. The “experiment” worked, 
and that was the normal transmis- 
sion mode. It could be risked be- 
cause on-board computers were 
good enough to let the spacecraft 
controllers back on Earth switch 
from the “experimental” mode to 
the regular 256/second rate if 
necessary. 

That’s where Mariner 9 was 
when it orbited Mars: 16,000 bits/ 
second. Mariner 10, the Venus- 
Mercury probe, got zero funds for 
equipment development; it had to 
go for the same price as the last 
one. But again Cal Tech and the 
others weren’t happy, and played 
around with the system within the 
fixed price budget they were given. 
They succeeded in a normal mode 
of 22 thousand bits/second — and 
an augmented rate of 117,000. The 
faster rate has worked fine, and as 
a result Mariner 10 has sent back 
from flyby’s as many frames of data 
as Mariner 9 got in nine months of 
orbiting Mars. 

The computer at JPL has to un- 
scramble that information. By the 



154 



GALAXY 




way, the signal from the spacecraft 
is 20 watts. If you’re reading this at 
night you’re probably using a 100 
watt lightbulb. The spacecraft uses 
1/5 of that to send 117,000 bits/ 
second over 100 million miles 
through space. 

Each frame of data contains 
more information than the human 
eye can appreciate. The computer 
at JPL plays with the “pictures” 
(actually, of course, they’re merely 
strings of numbers) to generate 
several presentations, some of them 
showing more features than an as- 
tronaut without a computer could 
see at the same distance from the 
target as the probe. 

That’s the computer Dan Alder- 
son, courtesy of JPL, brought to the 
Nebula Banquet. Of course he 
didn’t actually pack it up into his 
suitcase and bring it to the Century 
Plaza, but he might as well have. A 
couple of ordinary telephone lines 
to Pasadena, an ordinary TV set, 
and some black boxes to hook 
things to the telephone; add an 
electric typewriter much like the 
one I'm using now, and we had all 
the power of JPL’s Big Brain at our 
disposal. 

Most of the writers used it to play 
a Star Trek war-game, of course. 

The point is, though, that no 
place on Earth is so remote that all 
i he information available to West- 
ern Civilization (or Eastern, for 
that matter) can’t be made instantly 
available there as needed. NASA 



will shortly launch a satellite system 
lor India that will, for the first time 
ever, put the central government 
into communication with the re- 
mote villages. 

Within a very few years the entire 
world will be linked in one vast 
global-village network. At the mo- 
ment the Soviet Union insists on re- 
taining jamming capabilities and 
spends a lot of money each year to 
keep outside ideas from penetrat- 
ing, but that’s probably a lost 
cause. Incidentally, the Soviets in- 
sist that no nation has a right to 
broadcast anything another nation 
can possibly receive without the 
prior approval of the recipient 
nation’s government. 

One suspects that attitude is not 
going to last. 

In the 50’s I once had a desk 
calculator, courtesy of the Univer- 
sity of Washington (and courtesy of 
the US Navy which was funding the 
project we worked on). It was the 
most expensive and complete desk 
calculator in the world. About forty 
undergraduates including myself 
blinded ourselves for several hours 
a day multiplying numbers with 
those beasts. We were doing some- 
thing unique in history: inverting a 
60 by 60 matrix. 

We had to invert the matrix to 
get the equations for predicting 
grades. It worked, incidentally: we 
did invert the matrices, and the 
Grade Prediction program does 
predict grades. You crank in cer- 



ASTEP FARTHER OUT 



155 




tain inputs such as high school 
grades and test results, and out 
come predictions of your four-year 
average given that you elect any one 
of about 40 majors. That’s right: a 
different prediction for each major, 
and the blasted things are pretty 
accurate, or were when I was there. 
The prediction can be upset by 
determination and hard work, or 
by the discovery of wild night-life 
and the game of bridge, but by and 
large if the prediction said you’d 
flunk out majoring in math, you’d 
better find another major. 

In the 60’s an aerospace outfit 
provided me with another desk cal- 
culator. This marvel clanked and 
clattered, but it was very fast, and 
had several memory cells as well as 
automatic square root and other 
goodies. The purchasing officer as- 
sured me it was the most advanced 
thing of its kind. The only thing 
better was a “real computer” which 
was way beyond my section’s bud- 
get. As 1 recall, this thing was 
about a foot wide and two long, and 
stood over a foot high. Some of that 
was the tape printer, but most was 
the electro-mechanical brain. It 
cost over a thousand dollars. 

Yesterday Hewlett-Packard beg- 
ged me to buy at a recently cut 
price a pocket-sized machine that 
will do fifty times what my friendly 
monster would, and do it fast; or, if 
I liked, I could invest $800 or so 
and get a programmable pocket 
calculator that will not only deliver 
logs and exponents and trig func- 



tions but also decisions and branch- 
ing; and it comes with a package of 
programs and a subscription to a 
programmer catalog. 

Or, if I like, I can send to MITS 
(not MIT; a company in Albu- 
querque) and for $400 I can buy 
two kits: one kit builds a desk 
calculator similar to the best non- 
programmable Hewlett-Packard, 
and the other builds a 256-step 
programming kit to attach to it. 
For $400 I get something like the 
“real computer” my purchasing of- 
ficer couldn’t buy nine years ago. 

I fully expect within a year to buy 
for under a thousand dollars a 
desk-sized computer that will equal 
the IBM 650 I learned on and 
which rescued us from myopic cal- 
culator-punching. The 650 took 
about nine hours to invert a big ma- 
trix, and had to store intermediate 
answers on punched cards; the 
gidgit I’ll probably buy won’t even 
have to do that. 

In less than 20 years, brainpower 
has become both physically and 
economically within the reach of 
nearly anyone. 

* * * 

Given energy and computing 
power it’s hard to think of any real 
bottleneck that can’t be avoided 
with rational planning — and we’ve 
the computers to help us do the 
rational planning. 

Food? With plentiful energy 
comes all the food we’ll need for a 



156 



GALAXY 




long time. First effect will be fer- 
tilizer: it takes nitrogen (well, nit- 
rates) to grow miracle crops, and 
nitrogen fixing takes energy (or a 
lot of time to let legumes do it by 
photosynthesis.) We’ve known how 
to fix nitrates for a long time, of 
course: the first time the Federal 
Government got in the dam-build- 
ing business was in order to power a 
big nitrogen-fixing plant at Muscle 
Shoals. Of course, the nitrates were 
to be used for explosives . 

After a few years of plentiful 
energy we can dispense with most 
croplands entirely. Artificial photo- 
synthesis, the actual construction 
of edibles from air, water, a few 
chemicals, and energy, isn’t very 
far away. At the AAAS meeting in 
San Francisco last spring there 
were several very hopeful reports. 

Building materials? It’s true 
enough that we’ve used up most of 
the easily available ores, but we’ve 
only started with deep mines. The 
South Africans are mining at two 
and three miles down right now. 

For that matter, why are we so 
concerned with iron and steel? 
Aluminum is one of the most plen- 
tiful substances on Earth. Mag- 
nesium is in plentiful supply. 
Modern composite materials such 
as fiberglass and the plastics 
haven’t even begun to be exploited. 
(Mostly, they can’t: building codes 
haven’t caught up to technology.) 

It takes only energy, and perhaps 
some complex manufacturing pro- 
cessing, to get building materials. 



Come to that, it takes only 
energy and some complex manu- 
facturing processing to put together 
nearly anything we’d ever want. 

* * * 

We’ve work ahead to lick the 
energy shortage, but there are no 
real technological breakthroughs 
needed; only economic ones, and 
perhaps the determination to do it. 

Even now, we have energy and 
computation power available to the 
masses in the US and much of 
Europe. Very few' science fiction 
writers of the ’40’s dared predict 
such a world at all — and I can 
think of none who could envision 
such capabilities for 1974. 

So. Why are the scientists 
gloomy? Why is there so much 
crepe-hanging when, looked at ob- 
jectively, we have capabilities that 
as late as 15 years ago would have 
been thought impossible before 
2000, if then? 

That question has to be either 
stupid or rhetorical, right? What 
we worry about is endless: we’ve got 
the ability to Pasteurize the planet. 
The streets aren’t safe any more. 
We’ve lost control of the govern- 
ment. The people who make the 
basic decisions about our lives are 
far away from us, and they don’t 
listen, nor will they leave us 

ALONE. 

In other words, suddenly I’m not 
writing about science any more, but 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



157 




about politics, and I’ve sworn a 
mighty oath to keep politics to a 
minimum in this column. 

I will suggest that for Americans, 
at least, we’ve got more control over 
our lives than any people ever had 
throughout history. After all, an 
Athenian boy could expect to turn 
out to defend his City every summer 
from the time he was 17 until he 
was 60; and in the years when there 
were no campaigns he could expect 
to work from dawn to dark getting 
food, shelter, and clothing. Many 
people still do. 

And as to our technological mar- 
vels not working very well, I often 
hear such complaints as: “Why it 
takes an hour to complete a cross- 
country phone call!” “What with 
traffic jams and tower foulups we 
couldn’t get from New York to Los 
Angeles in less than nine hours!” 

And I remember the Good Old 
Days and just how long it took to fly 
from Seattle to Huntspatch (Hunts- 
ville, Alabama on the map) in a 
gooney bird, and making appoint- 
ments for long-distance calls, and 
perhaps 1 don’t see things the way 
some younger people do. 

When you come down to it, many 
of our complaints stem from so 
many people being so well off. You 
can’t afford servants nowadays: the 
servant class can make too much 
money doing something else (or 
nothing at all.) Many places for- 
merly reserved to the rich are 
crowded because everyone can not 
only get to them, but afford the 



time to go. And so forth. 

Leaving politics out, the world is 
in pretty good shape when the low- 
est paid members of the working 
class have marvels available that 
the wealthiest and most powerful 
kings of history never dreamed of: 
rapid transportation, instant com- 
munications, computing power, 
enough light to see by even in the 
dead of night . 

The Industrial Revolution, even- 
tually and after setting human free- 
dom back quite a ways at first, 
eventually gave leisure, shelter, and 
clothing to the masses. The energy 
and computer revolutions make it 
possible to give nearly everyone 
more actual freedom than anyone 
ever had before this Century.* 

Is that what scares us? 

*1 include in modern freedoms: 
spectacles to free us from myopia; 
medical science so we don’t have to 
accept bad teeth, constant nagging 
backache, consumption (17 of my 
granduncles and aunts died of con- 
sumption in the period 1900-1915), 
ague, rheumatism, etc., all regard- 
ed as inevitable even for the wealthy 
not so long ago; and, for some of us 
at least freedom from constant 
worry about feeding our families. 

If you like you can add: stereo re- 
cordings, cheap books, cameras we 
can afford, etc., and generate a list 
of marvels that Grandfather would 
have regarded as magic. I wonder 
what he’d have done with such 
things? *

T im heard the first shock before 
he felt it. It began like the 
rumble of a distant train. Then as it 
grew louder he saw the trees begin 
to sway and the earth start to 
shake. He was frightened. 

L uz had been damn mad when he 
j had to cancel out on their trip 
together. She hurled a great string 
of Spanish curses at him over the 
phone when he called on Thursday 
to say that on Saturday the day 
they’d planned to meet in Portland, 
he’d be in Anchorage. 

“But you’ve done the same 
thing,” he retorted. “Remember 
that weekend when I had tickets to 
the jazz festival?” 

“That was different. It was a 
medical emergency. They needed 
me at the hospital! All you’re going 
to do is muck around with some evil 
underground test.” 

It was an old argument. He was a 
geologist and she was a doctor. And 
she could not see how nuclear tests 
designed to tap pools of natural gas 
or to harness heat from inside the 
earth to generate electricity could 
compare with a cardiac arrest of 
some kid at the county hospital in 
Reno where she was on the pedia- 
trics staff. 

He started to explain to her just 
how important and humanitarian 
what he was doing was, how neces- 
sary these last minute adjustments 
would be to the success of the 
Arctic Energy project, and just 



what the project would mean to the 
welfare of millions of people. But 
she wasn’t listening. 

“No,” she shouted over the 
phone. “Shut up. I don’t want to 
hear any more. Do what you damn 
please. I’ll go someplace where I’m 
wanted. After all it is the only vaca- 
tion I’ve had since I started medical 
school.” And she slammed down 
the receiver. 

Okay, if that’s the way she wants 
it, he told himself. After all she 
wasn’t the only woman around. He 
should have known better than get 
mixed up with a Latin anyway. 
Spoiled and headstrong, even if she 
was damn smart. And if that 
weren’t enough, she came from a 
family of Chilean left-wingers so 
every other week she was moaning 
about the current government role 
in Chile and how the U.S. had 
helped overthrow Allende and his 
Commie friends in 1973. 

He put down the telephone re- 
ceiver carefully, resisting the temp- 
tation to throw it across the room. 
He'd been warned, he knew. He 
had met her right after the right- 
wing takeover in Chile and she had 
been carrying on about how her 
father had supposedly died of a 
heart attack in that stadium where 
they’d held everybody. What a fool 
he’d been! But at the time he’d 
been touched by her volatile Latin 
sorrow. 

So he settled his affairs at his 
private office, arranged things at 
the university where he taught part-

time, and caught a San Francisco- 
Anchorage flight. Serve her right if 
she didn’t know where to get in 
touch with him. 

$ 4 ! * * * * 

T he first tremor wasn’t too bad. 

A couple of tree limbs came 
crashing to the ground, but from 
his window Tim didn’t see flames 
shoot in the air which would have 
signaled gas-line breaks. After a 
few seconds the rumbling started 
again. 

* * * * * * 

T he problem he’d been called in 
on was tough. Somebody had 
shown that for optimum effect the 
underground test ought to be locat- 
ed on an island fifteen miles to the 
east and five to the south — so the 
UN Atomic Testing Supervisory 
Team authorized a shift in the ex- 
periment even though it was only 
about three weeks before the auth- 
orized test date. The Atomic Energy 
Commission and Arctic Energy, the 
consortium of companies, had to 
bring in one hundred fifty highly 
trained construction workers and 
electronic technicians — all with 
Top Secret clearances — to make 
the actual shift. It was going to take 
them right up to the night before 
the test date to complete the new 
installation and hook up all the 
monitoring equipment. 

Tim wasn’t involved with that of 
course, but he spent a lot of time 
wandering around the construction 



site, thinking about the work he 
was presented with. The questions 
were fairly straight forward — ones 
about how the blast would affect 
the adjacent oil field and what 
variations in air pressure and tides 
would do to the blast. Tim wonder- 
ed briefly why they hadn’t all been 
done before the decision to shift the 
test had been made, but then he got 
caught up in trying to get adequate 
computer facilities to solve them. 
The officials wouldn’t let him tie 
into the Livermore complex or even 
the University of Alaska com- 
puter — something about security — 
so he had to crank them out on the 
antiquated model the AEC’s ex- 
pedition ship carried. 

He walked around the five square 
miles of the little scab they called 
an island, watching the men work 
and figuring out how to pose his 
questions so the computer could 
answer them. It was July, too, and 
he’d never seen the Arctic summer 
before, so some of the time he ad- 
mired the little flowering plants 
that clung to the rocks, and the 
birds, and the long, long days. 

When he got back to Oakland on 
August 4th there was a huge pile of 
mail on his desk. Reports, letters 
about his last consulting job on the 
trans-Atlantic oil pipeline, jour- 
nals. But as he flipped through the 
stack a post card showing an in- 
credibly white beach with an unbe- 
lievably blue ocean in the back- 
ground stopped him. He turned it 
over: “Miss you,’’ it said in Luz’s 



THE AUGUST REVOLUTION

nearly illegible doctor’s scrawl. The 
postmark was San Jose, Costa 
Rica, where her mother and young- 
er sisters lived now, having fled 
Chile. 

He had to smile. She was quite a 
girl, all right. Bull-headed and hot- 
tempered — definitely not the sort of 
woman he ought to think about 
marrying, even on those rare oc- 
casions when mortality weighed 
and the thought of dynasty became 
seductive. Besides it wouldn’t be 
sensible to become too attached to- 
someone whose background and 
politics were so different. Not that 
he cared that much about politics — 
they bored him — but Luz did and 
therein lay the problem. 

But, well, they really did enjoy 
each other’s company. And other 
things. He started to call her, but 
the long distance operator was al- 
ready there. 

“Person to person call for 
Timothy Harvey.’’ 

It was Luz. 

“Look, come up this weekend,” 
she said after the preliminaries. 

“Love to,” he said. “I’m feeling 
horny too.” 

Instead of laughing she sounded 
angry, frightened. “No, not that. I 
want to talk to you.” 

H er face broke out in a grin, 
though, when he loped up the 
hospital steps, late Friday after- 
noon. She ran out to greet him, 
something she’d never done before. 
Tim surprised himself, too, be- 



cause when he saw her coming he 
threw out his arms to catch her, 
picked her up and whirled her 
around. When he sat her down he 
noticed she was blushing. 

“Sorry, Doctor,” he said. 
“Didn’t mean to make a spec- 
tacle.” 

“That’s okay,” she said. “It’s 
good to see you.” And then she 
clung to him a second longer. 

Yes, there really was something 
bothering her, he decided as he 
watched her sit silently beside him 
in the car as they headed south to a 
campground on the eastern side of 
the Sierras. But they had set up 
camp and eaten dinner before she 
said anything. The sun had set be- 
hind the mountains, which rose 
abruptly to the west, and the sky 
was the pale transparent blue of 
twilight. 

T here were other people in the 
campground but the willows of 
the stream-bottom shielded them. 
Tim was tending the fire. Luz 
huddled next to it, shivering and 
sipping her wine from a metal cup. 

He reached over to give her a 
hug. “Hey, you’re freezing. Didn’t 
you bring a jacket, Doctor?" 

She looked up at him as if she 
didn’t see him. 

“There’s a sweatshirt on the 
back seat if you want it,” he added, 
turning to poke the fire. 

She stood up and walked slowly 
over to the car. Just as slowly she 
opened the door, reached in and

pulled out the sweatshirt. She 
started to pull it on, but when she 
had pushed her head through she 
stopped, stood looking at the 
mountains. Her face looked more 
solemn than before. 

“Can you predict earthquakes?” 
she asked abruptly. 

“What’s the matter, Doc? Afraid 
the mountains will tumble, Gibral- 
tar will — er — fall?” he replied, ex- 
pecting a grin. 

“No, be serious for a minute. 
Can scientists predict earth- 
quakes?” 

He looked at her carefully. He’d 
seen her angry fairly often but she 
rarely looked as she did now. She 
was one of the least alarmist people 
he’d ever known. A doctor, for 
god’s sake; trained to handle emer- 
gencies. Even if it seemed a stupid 
question, he couldn’t dismiss it if it 
bothered her so much. 

“No,” he said. “Not with any ac- 
curacy. Some guys claim they can 
tell you there’ll be one here during 
a given three month period or 
something, but they, aren’t very 
accurate.” 

“Nobody can tell you there’ll be a 
quake of such and such a size to- 
morrow at 10 a.m. in such and such 
a place?” Her black, snapping eyes 
riveted him. 

“No,” he said. “ — not that I 
know of.” 

She sat down heavily on a log and 
stared for a few minutes at the fire. 
Her silence weighed on him. 

“Why do you want to know? 



What’s eating you?” he asked. 

She looked up as if she were sur- 
prised he was there. “Oh,” she 
said, coming to her senses. “It’s 
nothing.” Then she stopped and 
considered. “No, damn it. It’s 
more than that.” She reached out 
and touched him on the arm. “Can 
you keep a secret?” 

His first thought was to laugh 
and tell her that his security clear- 
ance was higher than hers would 
ever be, but then he realized that 
might be just what she was con- 
cerned about. 

“Is it something about Chile?” 
he asked, without thinking. 

“Yes,” she said softly. “I should 
have kept quiet. The others would 
have fits if they knew I was talking 
to you about earthquakes. She 
looked at him straight in the eye; 
“Can I trust you?” 

Trust: what a word. He had 
never met another woman he liked 
as much or fit with so well. But he 
was what he was, and he had cer- 
tain responsibilities to — well, it 
sounded maudlin, but to his coun- 
try. And obviously a lot of things 
Luz believed in blinded her to what 
was best for his country — and for 
the world. 

‘‘I can, can’t I? You won’t 
start ...” She watched his face 
carefully, then her voice trailed off. 

“Yeah,” he said, with sudden 
decision. “You can trust me. What 
is it?” 

He walked up and down in front 
of the fire while she told him. How

she’d met a group of Chileans in 
Costa Rica who were planning an 
uprising on Tuesday, August 11 at 
6:10 a.m. local time. How the date 
and hour were picked by Professor 
Ernesto Mendez, the Chilean geo- 
physicist who now resided in Mexi- 
co City; because an earthquake of 
5.9 on the Richter scale would oc- 
cur in Santiago at that time. How 
the uprising had been planned to 
take advantage of the chaos the 
quake would bring. How they had a 
two-year plan to bring democracy 
and socialism back. And how Luz 
was leaving on the Sunday flight 
from San Francisco so she could 
help. 

“It’s going to be a slaughter if 
the earthquake doesn’t occur but 
then they’ll need me even more be- 
cause they have hardly any medical 
personnel at all,” she said. “I 
wanted to know what you thought, 
though. Just so I’d be prepared.’’ 

He stopped in front of her. She 
picked up a stick and threw it in the 
tire. “I also wanted to say goodbye 
to you,’’ she said, very softly.

as the second tremor hit, Tim 
if\. heard someone scream and 
then the pounding of running feet, 
as the someone tried to get out- 
doors. That was silly, his benumbed 
mind told himself. Better to stay in- 
side in a solid structure than get hit 
by falling cornices and chimneys. 
But he had a hard time pushing 



down the panic inside himself. And 
another part of his mind told him 
that it probably wouldn’t matter 
where you were because the demons 
in the earth would get you anyway. 

T hat night after they had made 
love in their tents Tim lay won- 
dering if he would have Luz’s cour- 
age. It was foolish; she was burning 
all her bridges, walking out like 
that. He ought to try to talk her out 
of it. What cause was worth throw- 
ing away your life? Besides, the new 
conservative government had things 
firmly under control, the news- 
papers all said. The only thing that 
kept him from arguing with her was 
the thought that he would like to be 
as determined as she. 

So they spent Saturday and most 
of Sunday just being. It was fine 
August mountain-weather, cool in 
the evening, crisply warm during 
the day. They hiked most of the 
day. Saturday, carrying their lunch 
with them and stopping to eat it 
and nap by the side of a little lake 
surrounded by red and silver peaks. 
Young mountains, like the Andes, 
Tim caught himself thinking. Evi- 
dence of the strain that followed the 
shoreline of the Pacific from Tierra 
del Fuergo to the Aleutians, and 
then around through Japan and be- 
yond. But he forced himself not to 
think about that, watched Luz curl- 
ed up on a rock, dozing as if she 
had not a care in the world.

After breakfast Sunday — eggs 
and bacon and fried potatoes cook- 
ed over the open fire — they started 
back to Reno, where they stopped 
to pick up her suitcase, and then 
drove on to San Francisco airport. 
He could think of little to say as 
they stood waiting for the gate to 
open. He asked her if she wanted a 
drink, but she shook her head with- 
out speaking and stood looking out 
at the runway where the jet was 
being readied for passengers. She 
would arrive in Santiago early the 
next morning, after changing 
planes in Mexico City. 

“Look,” he said while she stood 
in the line for the anti-hijack 
search. “Be careful, will you?” He 
swallowed. “I’d hate to have any- 
thing happen to you.” 

She looked up at him and smiled 
tensely, as if she were afraid she’d 
start to cry. “Sure,” she said. 
“Don’t worry about me.” 

He leaned over and kissed her 
quickly. “ Vayit con Dios,” he said, 
and turned and walked away. 

He didn’t think about the under- 
ground test until he woke up the 
next morning. It was scheduled for 
Tuesday, too. 

One of the guys from the AEC 
called in the afternoon to see if Tim 
had keys to the earth-sciences 
building at the university. He want- 
ed to watch the seismograph reader 
there record the shock waves from 
the underground explosion, but the 
building was usually locked after 
midnight, and the blast was sup-

posed to go off shortly before 2 
a.m., he said. 

Two? Tim wondered. Of course, 
they’d been talking about a blast 
time shortly before midnight in 
Alaska; there was a two-hour time 
difference. Sure, he’d fix it so they 
could get in the building, he said, 
as he doodled with time zones on a 
sheet of paper. Two in California, 
midnight in Alaska, and 6 a.m. in 
Chile. 

Six a.m. in Chile! That’s when 
the earthquake was supposed to 
happen. He stopped. Coincidence 
again? Suppose . suppose Men- 
dez was right. He had a good repu- 
tation. It was just barely possible 
that he might know something 
about the faults there that nobody 
else did. 

It took Tim about two hours to 
make all the calculations, and even 
then it was all strictly back-of-the- 
envelope. But it certainly appeared 
that the harmonics of the shock 
waves from the underground test 
would be placed precisely to am- 
plify a quake occurring twenty- 
three minutes later halfway around 
the world, to make a 5.9 quake into 
an 8.9 one — into a major disaster. 

Poor Luz. 

No, it couldn’t be. There had to 
be a mistake. 

Then he remembered the change 
in the test site. Another coinci- 
dence? But there was no question 
about it. Assuming he wasn’t mak- 
ing a major methodological error, 
the shift of the few miles from the 



first site made a huge difference in 
terms of alignment with stress- 
lines and faults in the Earth’s crust. 
The angles were just enough dif- 
ferent so that a quake in Chile, if 
there were one, would go unaffect- 
ed by the underground test. 

It looked like more than a coin- 
cidence. Somebody wanted a huge 
quake in Chile. Somebody who 
knew' about the plans for the up- 
rising? A disaster would be a great 
excuse for martial law, for taking 
over a country. 

No, that couldn’t be — he’d been 
around Luz too long. It simply was 
an accident, one of those terrible 
coincidental accidents that could 
mean the death of thousands and 
thousands of people. 

He called up his friend at the 
A EC, to ask him if he knew who 
was in charge up at the test site. 
There’d been some kind of foul-up 
in the work he’d done earlier, he 
said, and he’d just come up with 
something the head man ought to 
see. 

“What sort of thing?” his friend 
asked warily. 

“Oh, something about seismic 
waves . .” Tim said, trying to 
think of a way to protect Luz. 

“And earthquakes?” the friend 
asked. 

“Yeah,” Tim answered without 
thinking. “How’d you know?” 

“Look, Tim, forget about it. 
Don’t stick your head in where 
you’re not wanted.” And he hung 
up.

T im’s desk started to slide across 
the floor on the third shock. It 
was quiet now in the corridor, but 
from the distance he heard the fire 
sirens, and, yes, it was unmistake- 
able, an air raid alarm. A lot of 
good that’s going to do, he thought. 
When things quieted momentarily 
he looked out the window again. 
There was a lot of smoke now and it 
looked like a part of the building 
next door had collapsed. And then 
the rumbling started again. 

T im sat paralyzed for half an 
hour after the phone call, whis- 
pering to himself that it couldn’t 
be. Then he decided that he had to 
get through to test headquarters 
anyway, to stall them for a few 
minutes, to postpone things just 
long enough to change the pattern 
of the waves echoing through the 
earth. For Luz, for all the others. 
And for himself. But the long dis- 
tance operator, even though she 
tried for three hours, couldn’t get 
through; all the lines to the test in- 
stallation were tied up and the An- 
chorage operator had instructions 
only to let through top-priority 
military calls. 

So he tried an old college buddy 
who'd enlisted in the Air Force and 
was stationed at the Pentagon, but 
the bastard hung up on him. Nor 



could he reach the university’s geol- 
ogy-department chairman whom he 
thought might have some contacts 
high up in Arctic Energy. And even 
his Congressman, his last resort, 
was on a fishing trip and wouldn’t 
be back until next Friday. 

It was nearly midnight by then 
and the only other thing he could 
think of doing was to warn Luz. It 
might be dangerous to try to locate 
her, but if she and her friends could 
tip people off, some of the death 
might be avoided as people went for 
higher ground or to the country. 

All he had was an uncle’s name, 
Felipe Sanchez, so he had the long 
distance operator try all of them in 
Santiago. While he waited he kept 
reminding himself that even if he 
did connect with her uncle there 
was no guarantee he’d contact Luz, 
too. 

The eleventh Sanchez, unbeliev- 
ably, was Luz's uncle, and even 
more unbelievably, she was there. 

“Hello, Doctor,” Tim said, not 
trusting himself to say more. 

“Tim!” she cried. But immed- 
iately frost came into her voice. 
“What do you want?” 

“I called to warn you,” he start- 
ed out but she interrupted. 

“Thanks a lot,” she said bitterly. 
“We know all about it.” 

“How?” 

“Mendez is no dummy. He heard 
about the movement of the test a 
couple of days ago, and put things 
together. We’re looking for who 
tipped off the Americans about the 



THE AUGUST REVOLUTION 



167 




coup.” There was suspicion in her 
voice. 

“Oh, Jesus, Luz, it wasn’t me. 
I’ve been trying to see if the test 
can’t be stalled. I had no idea that’s 
what I was working on . .” 

“Sure, sure. You were just doing 
your job.” She sounded as if she 
were trying to keep her voice hard, 
but she choked in spite of herself. 
“Rebuilding will be like starting 
the Twentieth century over again, 
you know.” 

“1 know,” Tim said. “How can I 
say how sorry I am? I’d never do 
anything to hurt you, if I could help 
it.” 

“But you did.” She had control 
of her voice again. “Oh, go take 
some measurements or something. 
We’ve got work to do here — to save 
lives.” 

“Luz, forgive me,” he broke in. 

There was a silence at the other 
end of the phone. 

“I want to see you again when it’s 
all over.” 

The silence continued for a few 
seconds more. Then: “We’ll see,” 
she said. There was another slight 
pause. “Goodbye,” and she hung 
up. 

There was nothing more to do. 
He’d exhausted all the possibilities 
he could think of, so about one he 
went over to start his vigil by the 
seismograph. It was a gorgeous, 
moonlit night, and as he walked 
across the deserted campus he saw 
three separate showers of meteors 
race across the sky from the hills to 



the bay. Falling stars; they were 
supposed to be lucky, weren’t they? 
Then he remembered: fine scientist 
you are, grasping at straws like 
that, looking for lucky signs. They 
were just part of the August meteor 
showers. Came every year; perfectly 
good, scientific explanation for 
them. And then irony of being a 
good scientist hit him; good enough 
to help destroy thousands of inno- 
cent people, including Luz. 

His friend was already in the 
building, watching. “Hi,” he said, 
cautiously. 

Tim grunted. 

“You know it had to be,” the 
friend said. “National security. 
Can’t allow a bunch of Commies 
like that to be successful. Look 
what happened in Cuba. The boys 
have set it up so it’ll be just a big 
enough quake so things will be just 
enough screwed up so we’ll have to 
send in the Marines to rebuild and 
keep order. Minimum involvement. 
Minimum loss of life. The military 
people think it’s a major break- 
through in strategy.” 

Tim glared at him and then 
turned back to the seismograph. 
The needle bounced back and forth 
gently, making lines like the little 
waves at the edge of a lake. Then 
there was a shock and the needle 
jumped. It was only 1:30 a.m. 

Tim laughed out loud. My god, 
maybe things would be all right 
after all. Maybe somebody else had 
figured out what was happening 
and had been as shocked as he was 



168 



GALAXY 




and had succeeded in short-circuit- 
ing something. 

The man from the AEC looked 
worried. “Very strange,” he said. 
“The blast isn’t due for another 
seventeen minutes.” He went into 
the office next to the reader to call 
someone. Tim stood grinning at the 
revolving drum and the bobbing 
needle without listening to the con- 
versation. There still would be 
problems with Luz, but at least it 
wasn’t as bad as it was. There 
would be a chance they might get 
together again. He loved her, he 
realized suddenly. 

Then at 1:47 a.m. the needle 
took another sideways jump, this 
time completely off the drum. The 
time, Tim remembered, would be 
exactly right if the blast had gone 
off as scheduled, and not earlier. 

“Hey,” Tim shouted. “Come 
look at this.” 

The other man came out of the 
office, looking worried. “What is 
it?” he asked. There was anger and 
age in his voice. 

“There was another shock,” Tim 
said. “What’s going on?” 

“The boys say the first one was 
an impact shock from a pretty 
good-sized meteorite that hit down 
in Iceland.” 

“So?” 

“You figure it out.” The man 
fished in his pants pocket for a 
match, and lit a cigarette he’d been 
holding in hand. “Bloody cosmic 
accident.” 

“More amplification?” 



“Yeah. This time we out-smarted 
ourselves.” 

* * * * * * 

B y the time the fourth shock hit, 
Tim was surprised at how calm 
he’d grown. What would be neat, 
he thought, would be to be in a 
satellite and watch the whole pano- 
rama. A couple hundred million 
years of geological history occurring 
in a couple of days. It had taken 
about five hours for the movement 
to reach California, and before the 
electricity had been cut he’d heard 
on the little radio in his office that a 
fissure running the length of Ice- 
land had opened and was pouring 
forth lava, while a row of volcanos 
had erupted, from Peru to Mexico. 

Of course it had been an in- 
credible oversight that nobody had 
figured in the effect a meteor would 
have — especially when the test oc- 
curred right in the middle of a 
yearly meteor shower. The big ones 
weren’t that common — they usually 
burned up before impact. But when 
you’re playing around with the 
planet’s internal structure you 
ought to remember that meteor 
falls in the past have been asso- 
ciated with reversals in the earth’s 
magnetic field. The earth may be a 
diamond: a tap there, a tap here — 
and the whole thing falls apart. 

Ordinarily the plates of the 
earth’s crust, wedged tightly to- 
gether, release pent-up energy only 
in the relatively tiny kerks we call 
earthquakes. But this time the 



THE AUGUST REVOLUTION 



169 




combination of blast, natural 
quake and meteor impact had 
suddenly set the plates free. Before 
the movement had pushed and 
shoved its way north, Tim had a 
chance to figure out roughly where 
things would end up. South Ameri- 
ca’s western shoreline would wind 
up a couple of hundred miles fur- 
ther west — even though the current 
coast region would be sucked back 
into the earth as the plate of the 
earth’s crust carrying the continent 
was forced down as it met another 
plate carrying part of the ocean 
floor. The whole of California west 
of the San Andreas fault would 
move 430 miles north. Africa would 
swing around, touch Europe once 
again, closing off the western end 
of the Mediterranean. The Red Sea 
would become a mini-ocean. All 
low-lying cities, whether they were 
touched by quakes or not, would be 
completely wiped out by tidal 
waves. Some new islands would ap- 
pear around the Hawaiian and Jap- 
anese archipelagoes. And volcanos 
all over the world, long thought ex- 
tinct, would erupt. 

God, what an exciting prospect! 
It would be great to be around 
when all the continents came to 
rest, to see what it was like. Of 
course it had all happened hun- 
dreds of times before since the 
breakup of the ancestral super-con- 
tinent, but probably never as 
quickly, not even a thousandth as 
quickly. 

But there was no way to escape 



the Bay Area, of course. The guys 
at the University of Sasketchewan 
and the University of Manitoba, 
and the ones in Australia and parts 
of Africa would be luckier. They 
were in the stable interior of con- 
tinents, rooted to the oldest rocks 
in the world, and they probably 
wouldn’t be directly touched by any 
of the destruction. Things would be 
a mess for 10 or 15 years; all the 
supply routes and communication 
centers would be wiped out, not to 
mention hydroelectric lines and oil 
and gas pipelines. But they’d sur- 
vive. It shouldn’t be too hard for 
them to pick up the pieces and see 
if the theories of continental drift 
and plate tectonics were valid. 

Tim stood at the window and 
watched the eighteen-story building 
across the road sway, then crumble. 
Well, he thought, I’m going to be 
as dead as Luz, if that’s any conso- 
lation for her. He grinned at the 
grimness of the thought. Such a 
nice girl . She wouldn’t blame 
him, not really. 

And then he laughed out loud. 
Because to the list of areas which 
would be relatively safe he suddenly 
remembered you’d have to add the 
interior of the USSR and a good 
part of China, not to mention 
Siberia. Boy, won’t the boys in the 
Pentagon just shit over that — if 
they have enough time to figure it 
out before the tsunami hits! 

Oh, Luz, Luz . 

And then came the fifth and (for 
him) final shock. *

Dear Jim, 

I’ve been reading Galaxy and If 
for about 15 years (it doesn’t seem 
like that long). I say reading, but 
that doesn’t mean reading from 
cover to cover. For the last couple 
of years, since Fred stepped down 
as editor, I’ve just been reading the 
features and pretty much ignoring 
the fiction. These two June issues 
are like waking from a bad dream. 

I can read the whole magazine 
again! Thanks Jim. 

Yours truly,

What can I say ? 

This letter directs itself to Jerry’s 
column in the May issue. Jerry's 
reply follows. 

Dear Jerry, 

Don’t give up on the Belt yet! 
Heinlein’s Rolling Stones had a 
pretty fair picture of a Belt civiliza- 
tion using hydrogen-burning NER 



VA vehicles, back in 1952. It had 
no capitol; each rock or cluster of 
rocks governed itself. But the clus- 
ters were not isolated; they had 
radio, and today would have com- 
munications-lasers. They did not 
sell their ores through any given 
rock such as Ceres, but through 
whatever large rock happened to be 
conveniently located at the time, 
which is a whole ‘nuther ball game. 

As for Larry Niven’s one-gee-ac- 
celeration ships and their enormous 
delta-vees, sure they could land on 
any planet they want. The point is 
that these are free-fall people who 
don’t especially want to. 

Yes, it would be chaper in fuel to 
have the capitol on Earth, but that 
missed the point entirely. Earth 
conditions are not asteroid condi- 
tions, and when somebody in the 
New York front office is making de- 
cisions for somebody else in a pres- 
sure suit, it is going to cost not only 
dollars, but lives, as that ignorant 
flatlander makes bad decisions 
simply because he doesn’t know the 
territory. Far better to have the 
boss be a seasoned Belter located 
on an asteroid before somebody 
gets killed. 

Pat Mathews

Albuquerque, NM 87112 

Good point. Obviously there 
could be many Belter civilizations, 
and my article said so; but any cen- 
tralization is likely to have Earth as 
its focal point. 



171 




Of course my column was partly 
done as a tongue-in-cheek jibe at 
my friend and collaborator, Larry 
Niven, particularly his Bottom of a 
Hole ; if you want to postulate that 
asteroid miners like it out there 
without gravity, and that we’ve 
physiologically developed ways to 
let them live like that, then of 
course another set of premises gov- 
ern. Most science fiction stories, 
though, have simply assumed that 
celestial mechanics make the Belter 
Civilization more profitable, and 
indeed inevitable, and my article 
was directed at that. 

As to government from afar, 
alas, I see little relaxation of cen- 
tralizing trends. Colonial adminis- 
trators found themselves chained to 
orders from Whitehall as soon as 
the undersea cable was invented; 
the war in Viet Nam was conducted 
on orders from Washington, just as 
the telegraph hamstrung soldiers in 
the last century. I agree that the 
man on the spot usually has a better 
idea of what’s going on, but after 
all, the hordes of officials staffing 
the home office bureaus must have 
something to do .

not see her or any other women rep- 
resented in your magazine. Nor do 



I see any mentioned among all of 
the glorious AWARDS you people 
give out to each other. So what’s 
the story? 

Dianna Prinette 

Hmmm ... it would seem that 
perhaps I have been a bit biased — 
four and one half of the eight stories 
in this issue were written by women. 
The cover is by Wendy Pini — as 
was the last Galaxy cover {her first 
two pro-mag covers ). Let me quote 
my reply to a similar letter from 
June Worlds of If {which, by the 
way, was almost entirely male): 
"... I plan to publish what I 
consider to be the best of those 
manuscripts submitted. Period. 

Dear Editor: 

Nominations are needed! I’m 
currently compiling an anthology of 
already published science or specu- 
lative fiction short stories to be- 
come a college textbook for training 
vocational counselors and thera- 
pists at the master’s and doctoral 
level. These stories should help po- 
tential counselors become more 
future oriented. 

I would appreciate receiving 
from anyone nominations of inter- 
esting science fiction short stories 
which depict: alternative life styles, 
the impact of change, the meaning 
of work or leisure, or any other con- 
cept or setting that will stimulate 
and enhance the preparation of vo- 
cational counselors and therapists.

GALAXY 




John Borden, Ph.D.

Well, THE DISPOSSESSED, by 
Ursula K. Le Guin, is not a short 
star v — but, aside from length, l 
can think of nothing more appro- 
priate. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I have been a subscriber to 
Galaxy for six or seven years, with a 
few gaps when I was out of the 
country, and for the first time I am 
moved to write to congratulate you 
on an issue and an apparent direc- 
tion. For style, energy, and quality, 
the July Galaxy is unexcelled in my 
memory. 

My favorite: J. A. Lawrence’s 
“Opening Problem.” Pournelle is 
marvelous though this month’s 
catalog of wonders is diffuse com- 
pared to previous articles. Is it pos- 
sible that the new Galaxy is ready 
to break out of the pulp cocoon and 
undergo the transformation to slick 
butterfly Panshin speaks of in “Di- 
rections?” I would pay more — pro- 
vided the quality sf to fill it can be 
found. If your first few issues are an 
indication, Mr. Baen, then you are 
the man to find it.

Dear Galaxy, 

I read the other day in Locus that 



a new editor was moving in, and 
was interested in new manuscripts 
by heretofore unpublished no- 
bodies, such as myself. 

I like the way Galaxy has been 
going, too. Doris Piserchia, R. A. 
Lafferty, Robert Sheckley, Joanna 
Russ, Sonya Dorman, and (most of 
all) Ted Sturgeon. I enjoyed Chris- 
topher Priest’s Inverted World, 
too. 

A couple of hopes: Fritz Leiber 
used to make frequent appearances 
in Galaxy. Has he devoted himself 
totally to Fafhrd and The Gray 
Mouser? Algis Budrys, where have 
you gone? Samuel R. Delany was 
never a Galaxy regular, but he, too, 
has disappeared. I miss the three of 
them very much. 

I also like Ursula K. LeGuin, 
Harlan Ellison, Philip Jose Farmer, 
and James Tiptree, Jr. ,when they 
make their infrequent appearances. 

Also, I note with pleasure that 
Jack Gaughan is doing covers 
again. Hooray! 

Anyway, please read the story. 

Jeff Hudson 

As per our previous conversation, 
your {revised) story is being run in 
August IF — as a collaboration with 
Dr. Isaac Asimov. 

You will find Fritz Lieber in 
August IF, while Ursula, of course, 
has been represented in the pre- 
vious issue . As for the other 
people you mention — I'm a fan of 
practically every one of them! +
