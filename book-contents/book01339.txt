ON DOING BETTER 



E ach year at the World Science 
Fiction Convention an award is 
given for excellence in the various 
fields of science fiction. The awards 
are called ‘‘Hugos”, after the late 
Hugo Gremshack, who started the 
whole thing in 1926; and the most 
recent batch were handed out at the 
New York convention, Labor Day 
weekend. 

For the second straight year, the 
“best magazine” Hugo went to If. 
We’re pleased about it, of course. We 
were even more pleased to note that 
all the awards in our categories came 
from either If or Galaxy — best 
novel was Robert A. Heinlein’s The 
Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (If), best 
novelette Jack Vance's The Last 
Castle (Galaxy), best short story 
Larry Niven’s Neutron Star (If) . 
while the award for best profession- 
al artist went to our longtime rejgu- 
lar contributor, who is also Art Edi- 
tor of our new companion magazine. 
International Science Fiction, Jack 
Gaughan. 

There is something pretty soul- 
satisfying about making a clean 
sweep, and we would be lacking in 
candor if we denied a considerable 
feeling of pride. But the same can- 
dor makes us want to try to take an 
objective look at just how good a 
“best” science-fiction magazine is 
. and to try to think of ways to 
make it better. 

T o begin with, science-fiction 
magazines appeal, after all, to 
only a relatively small percentage 
of the population — well under one 
per cent — and, in an age of mass- 



production giantism, that places us 
all under a heavy handicap before 
we leave the post. A science-fiction 
magazine may put out 100,000 copies 
of each issue on the newsstands — 
but there are upwards of 400,000 
newsdealers in the United States 
alone; if we put out only one copy 
on each stand, we would be unable 
to cover as much as 25% of the 
outlets. In practice, even that is 
impossible because it’s not eco- 
nomically feasible to put a single 
copy in a newsstand; and we wind 
up with, at best, perhaps one news- 
dealer in ten carrying a few copies 
of Galaxy or If. So getting the 
magazines out where it’s possible 
for you to find them is a complex 
game, made more difficult by the 
fact that we don’t always buy in 
the same place. A handy way 
around this trouble would be to sell 
the magazines by subscription. 
We’re always glad to do that, of 
course; but with a mobile popula- 
tion, a lot of people hesitate to try 
to predict where they’ll be six 
months or a year in the future. And 
our subscription prices are relative- 
ly high: the major slick magazines 
will spend $5 to wheedle you out 
$2.99 for a subscription, which they 
can manage because they are sub- 
sidized by advertisers. We can’t. 

The point of this is that science- 
fiction magazines are relatively 
small potatoes in the publishing 
patch, and it seems they are likely 
to stay that way. Which, in turn, 
means that we can’t compete in pay- 
ments to authors and so on with 
the larger media. 



4 




And yet we do! Funnily enough, 
writers who are i>erfectly capable 
of earning five or ten times the 
word-rate they can get from a sci- 
ence-fiction magazine will neverthe- 
less spurn the offers of the big 
slicks to produce work for us. 

Anybody capable of making a liv- 
ing out of writing science-fiction is, 
invariably, capable of making at 
least twice as much by writing 
something else. Dozens of top sci- 
ence-fiction writers have proved 
this, performing brilliantly and 
lucratively in TV and screen writ- 
ing, in selling to the large-circula- 
tion slicks, in the writing of adver- 
tising copy, publicity, all the blue- 
chip areas of literary craftsmanship. 

Yet we still keep our writers, and 
the question is, why do they stay 
with us? Not for the money; not 
for the prestige. 

As a matter of fact, you are the 
reason science-fiction writers will 
take time out from fat assignments 
to produce a story for If or Galaxy, 
What we have that no other media 
can offer is an audience composed 
exclusively of people like you. In 
terms of I.Q., in terms of alertness 
and knowledgability, in terms of 
general high quality of readership, 
science-fiction readers are the class 
of the publishing field. And that’s 
what writing is all about: communi- 
cation with people who can under- 
stand what the writer is saying. 

S o what we try to do is keep the 
interest of people like you, be- 
cause that’s how we can keep the 
good writers who have developed 
in the science-fiction field and will 
stay with it just exactly as long as 
you do. 

Over the next few months we 



hope to add a few new features to 
If — because we think you’ll enjoy 
them. One thing we’re sure of — if 
you don’t, you’ll let us know. We 
wouldn’t have it any other way .... 

And, of course, we’ll continue to 
do the best we can to find and print 
for you the top science fiction avail- 
able, by the best writers, old and 
new, in the field. Have you been 
noticing, by the way, how many new 
writers v/e’re finding these days? 
The reason is simple : we’ve been ac- 
tively looking for them. For five 
years now we’ve had at least one 
‘‘first” story in each issue of If. We 
started the program with a certain 
amount of apprehension; we weren’t 
a bit sure that we could keep it up 
for more than a couple of months. 
But several do^n stories later, we’re 
pleased to report that the supply 
of “first” stories is healthier now 
than ever, and even more pleasant 
is the discovery that a lot of the 
new writers we’ve attracted have 
stayed with the field. Our first of 
all firsts was Joseph Green, now 
the author of a fair number of 
magazine stories and novels. Larry 
Niven was a first three years ago; 
now he’s got a Hugo of his own. And 
we expect much the same for half 
a dozen others we can think of off- 
hand .... 

And that’s another thing you — 
the collective “you” that reads If 
and Galaxy and the other science- 
fiction magazines: You not only 
read and understand science fiction, 
a number of you go on to write It. 
In fact, there’s hardly a science- 
fiction writer who didn’t begin as a 
reader — 

Doesn’t that suggest anything to 
you? 

— Frederik Pohl

THE 

PEACEMAKERS 

by JOHN RANKINE 



Illustrated by FINLAY 



Easy job! All they had to do was 
invade a planet, steal its secrets, 
destroy its power — without a war! 



I 

C ommunications One 'asked for a 
repeat; and the tone of his voice, 
even filtered throu^ the intercom, 
was unmistakably critical. 

Its harmonic of doubt was echoed 
in every head on the net; but there 
was no other ^oken comment when 
Fletcher’s coldly clear repetition 
came back. 



There was every reason for doubt. 
Petrel, after a major refit, was hom- 
ing in deep space on the squadron 
to which she had been assigned. The 
distant ships were coming up in the 
zoom lens of the main scanner. 

Five craft: silver beads on a black 
velvet display pad. Europa in the 
center, a capital ship, a major unit 
in the Inter-Galactic Organization’s 
peace-keeping force. Outriding in a 



6 




protective screen, four pencil-slim 
corvettes, like Petrel herself, seem- 
ingly motionless as they kept station 
with the cruiser. 

Joining the squadron and taking 
her designated place was a complex 
maneuver for Petrel, All hands were 
at action stations, sealed up and 
buckled into deep-foam acceleration 
couches. The course changes involv- 
ed would mount as much G as a 
primary blastoff from a planetary 
pad and would rate infinitely more 
subtle calculation. 

Commander Dag Fletcher, swing- 
ing on his gymbal-mounted couch on 
the corvette’s tiny command island, 
said again, “Hold fast on the auto 
chain. I’ll take her in on manual.” 

He had been with Petrel for two 
weeks, having taken over as his first 
independent command after the long 
refit had been completed. Her crew 
had been together, except for three 
new men, through the action which 
had almost destroyed her and which 
had killed her captain. They were 
a powerful in-group and accepted the 
new top man with many reservations. 

Fletcher knew it would be so and 
accepted the challenge. No body of 
men which had endured what they 
had been through could avoid the 
group feeling which had emerged 
from it. They would have liked to 
see one of their own number put up 
to the command slot. Sam Cotgrave, 
in fact, who was swinging next to 
Fletcher in the co-pilot seat on the 
command island. That was natural 
enough. He would have felt that way 
himself. But he recognized the basic 
wisdom of the I.G.O. staff in bring- 
ing in someone from outside. 



Command was, after all, not a 
friendly game. He was likely to have 
to make decisions which would bal- 
ance the lives of every one of them 
against some theoretical gain for the 
authority they served. Nobody could 
afford to risk a commander who 
might have to say, “Shall I send my 
friend Joe or my friend Fred?” 

But from the beginning, he would 
have it clear that they had drawn a 
spaceman who knew what it was 
all about. One who could handle the 
ship with or without benefit of mech- 
anical aids. 

T he duty officer in Europa's con- 
trol room had picked up the 
tiny speck of the hurrying corvette 
and was feeding deliberate observa- 
tions to his tracking computers. 
Linked on the same net, Falcon, 
Drake, Heron and Hawk trainedi 
major armaments in concert. 

When Petrel was still a pea-sized 
globule, she was the focus of such 
a concentration of destructive power 
that she could have been dispersed 
as a faint nimbus of glowing gas 
before her commander had time to 
call a course change. Five computer- 
based tracking systems lock^ on 
and monitored the oncoming craft. 
An exchange of coded recognition 
signals cleared the air; and McCool, 
Euro pa's duty officer, took his finger 
from the button which would have 
called the squadron to battle stations 
Then he was looking incredulously 
at an empty screen and, by reflex, 
thumibing down the stud that sent 
urgent alarm bleeps to every corner 
of the cruiser. 

Admiral P. J. Varley, first into the 



PEACEMAKERS 



7 




ccmmand center, still sealing up, 
with his visor hinged back, said, 
"mat is it, Jock?” 

“New corvette joining the squad- 
ron, Admiral.” 

“So?” 

“Recognition checked okay; but 
now she’s slipped the tracking gear.” 

“You believe she could be a hos- 
tile?” 

In every command center of the 
squadron, the same speculation 
about PetreVs uncharacteristic behav- 
ior was repeated. Consequently there 
was a full audience to see the cor- 
vette appear as though 'by sleight of 
hand out of the single narrow blind 
vector on Europa*s port quarter and 
take up her station with a flamboy- 
ant course change which must have 
put her crew on the extreme edge 
of G tolerance. 

Her commander’s level tones came 
up on every net. They said simply, 
“I.G.O. corvette Petrel reporting for 
service with Red Squadron. Request 
instructions.” 

Varley, mastering anger, said 
thickly to Europa's captain, for all 
to hear, “Get that fool along to see 
me. Commander. Stand down, if you 
please.” 

O n Petrel herself there was a sus- 
pension of criticism. Probably 
only the navigators, Bennett, Slu- 
man. Hale and the co-pilot himself 
could fully appreciate what the new 
commander’s performance was all 
about. To the rest it was simply a 
spectacular maneuver which could 
have been misinterpreted by the 
ships they were coming to join. 
There was, however, a certain pride 



in it. Petrel was in business again 
and showing that she was a crack 
outfit. 

Only one man was positively an- 
tagonized by it. One of the new men 
— Dave Hocker, Power Two — 
had already crossed the new com- 
mander and was ready to swing into 
positive enmity. He thought, but did 
not put into audible speech, “The 
crazy fool. Playing to the gallery. 
Looking for a pat on the head from 
'blood — and — gut Varley. All 
right Mister Clever-bloody-Fletcher. 
Watch it, that’s all, watch it.” 

But when the summons came, as 
Fletcher knew it would, and he was 
moving into the pressure lock. Cot- 
grave said, “Good luck. Command- 
er.” The calculated risk had paid off. 
Whatever Varley had to say about it 
was unimportant against the fact 
that he was one step closer to solid- 
arity with the crew of Petrel, The 
sooner they were integrated as a 
team which would jump when he 
said jump, the better for one and all. 

His own face looked back at him 
through its transparent visor from 
the polished bulkhead of the pres- 
sure lock. It seemed the greatest ir- 
relevance of all. Elongated by the 
curvature, even longer and thinner 
than nature had devised, it showed 
gray-green eyes, fair hair cut very 
short, grim-looking mouth. 

Outside Europa's lock, he hooked 
on and uncouple the thin nylon line 
which had tethered him like an um- 
bilical cord to his own ship. He saw 
it whip back, spring-loaded, over the 
divide and he went inside, carrying 
with him a panoramic view of a 
backdrop of infinite violet-black

IF 




depth, glittering with multicolored 
sequins of distant light. Incurably 
introspective, his computer mind 
filled with his own minute impor- 
tance against that backdrop. It was 
difficult in that setting to give any 
value to human action at all. 

II 

V arley said, “I am bound to tell 
you, Commander, that your un- 
3rthodox method could have had 
serious consequences. Quite apart 
from the danger to the squadron if 
you had hit a collision course. I 
see your point and I hope you were 
justified. But no more of it. Under- 
stand? There’ll be action enough in 
the very near future to shake your 
crew down into a combat team. 
There’s a squadron conference in 
fifteen minutes. Take a look round 
and get to know what Euro pa's con- 
trol center has to offer. I’ll reserve 
judgment.” 

Dag Fletcher was relieved that 
Varley had gone no further. But he 
was under no illusion about the fu- 
ture. Every new commander was al- 
lowed one mistake; this was his. He 
had used up his slack. Next time 
he would be out, and that would 
mean no other command experience 
in his I.G.O. service and could carry 
its smear over to the civil space cor- 
poration to which he would return, 
if he did return, when the compul- 
sory stint was done. 

R ound the conference table, Var- 
ley had seven attentive listeners. 
T here was his own staff lieutenant. 
Grant Crowford, a dark, muscular 



type, looking like an intellectual 
weight-lifter in his gray-ribbed inner 
suit; Group-Commander Frazer, 
captain of Europa, hair clipped short 
so that he seemed prematurely balJ. 
In a semi-circle facing him, Simpson 
of Falcon, dark, predatory, whose 
prototype might have sailed with 
Morgan; Cooper of Drake, round- 
faced, usually smiling in a rictus of 
facial muscle which had nothing to 
do with benevolence; Driscoll of 
Heron, heavy shoulders hunched for- 
ward, hands out in front of him on 
the table-top. Cameron of Hawk, a 
huge rawboned Scot with red hair 
cut back to a rusty stubble. 

Fletcher, the newcomer, had been 
angled into the center seat so that 
Varley’s eye naturally rested on him; 
and the address seemed to be de- 
livered as a tete-a-tete. 

In point of fact a great deal of it 
concerned him, and he began to rea- 
lize that chance had cast Petrel for 
a very dicey role. 

Varley said, “The object of the 
exercise, then, is to release certain 
I.G.O. nationals interned on Gara- 
mas. A cutting-out expedition, if 
you like. With the force at our dis- 
posal it would be possible to demand 
what we want, and no sane govern- 
ment could deny it; but there is 
more to it than that.” 

He paused for a count of five 
as though marshalling the data in his 
mind, as he must have done often 
enough, before summoning the con- 
ference. He looked his part. Square 
jowled. Graying. Half a lifetime of 
command decisions had left a set- 
tled residue in the set lines of his 
face and his disillusioned eyes.

“In the first place, Garamas is a 
neutral planet. You can see why its 
government has tried to keep that 
status. Right on the frontier of 
J.G.O. space, they are in line for 
any retaliation that the Outer Gal- 
actic Alliance might make. The way 
they have played it over the years, 
O.G.A. are no more anxious than 
we are to force the issue. It’s useful 
to have Garamas as a point of con- 
tact. Nearly every major planet has 
a consulate there; it’s a meeting 
point. 

“Moreover, there is a delicate po- 
litical situation. The present govern- 
ment has majority support; but there 
is a very powerful fascist element 
waiting for any opportunity to seize 
control. If the government showed 
weakness in foreign policy that could 
be the pretext they are waiting for.” 

Frazer, as a privileged listener, 
interposed with a question. “I take 
it there’s been a request for release 
at diplomatic levels?” 

“Certainly. But the Garamas gov- 
ernment will not move. They can't, 
with Scotia and Chrysaor represent- 
ed there and watching for an oppor- 
tunity to claim repatriation for their 
own nationals. TTiere’s a Scotian 
ship impounded. They’d have trouble 
enough if they moved a centimeter 
from strict neutrality. 

“But there’s another thing, and I 
needn’t remind you that this is top- 
line, classified material. Amongst 
our people in the internment sector 
is an I.G.O. agent who had been 
working in Fingalna and got out on 
a Garamasian freighter just before 
the O.G.A. powers drew together in 
their present venture. He has a re- 



port which must be gotten away. 

“Basically, that is all we are in- 
terested in as a military expedition. 
Recovery of the personnel is a use- 
ful cover, and we’ll do what we can 
for them. But I say to you now that 
if any one of them has to be ditched, 
that is the way of it. You understand 
me?” 

Nods from round the table came 
without enthusiasm, but he knew he 
had made his point. 

“Now the cover for the squadron 
is that we are paying a courtesy call 
on a neutral planet. Showing the 
flag, you might say. I have no doubt 
that our intensions were signaled 
ahead. Europa and four corvettes 
have clearance to enter the gravi- 
sphere of Gramas in thirty-six hours 
from now, rationalized time. Four 
corvettes, checked and named on 
the visa. But las you see we have 
five.” 

S even pairs of eyefe tracked briefly 
round to focus on Fletcher, then 
Varley was off again. 

^'Petrel left her refit base ostensi- 
bly for a home posting. She changed 
course on sealed orders when she 
was well beyond the reach of prying 
eyes. She is a bonus which alters 
the balance in our favor, so this is 
what I propose.” 

Varley used micro switchgear on 
the small console let into his desk 
top, and one wall of the cabin was 
filled by two circular projections of 
Garamas. 

Left was a large central land mass, 
which petered out towards the cir- 
cumference in an archipelago like 
a bead chain. The right was almost 



PEACEMAKERS 



n 




empty, except for a roughly oblong 
continental mass lying along the 
equator. 

Varley moved a stylus on the atlas 
page before him. A dot moved in 
sympathy on the large-scale map. 
It came to rest as an asterisk over 
a population center on the left-hand 
circle. 

He said, “That is the capital city 
of Garamas. Cristinobyl. Half the 
population of the planet is concen- 
trated there. The space port at Cris- 
tinobyl is about twenty kilometers 
outside the city. They have first-class 
equipment and will pick us up as 
soon as we cross the gravisphere 
line. At that time they would find 
out Petrel has joined the squadron. 

“I propose at that time to emit 
a succession of cobalt flares. When 
we arrive it can be explained that 
this was an accidental discharge. But 
for at least thirty minutes their mon- 
itoring gear will be unable to give 
them precise data.” 

Dag Fletcher felt a sudden tight- 
ening of the nerves which he knew 
as a sixth-sense nudge that his num- 
ber was coming up. He did not have 
long to wait. 

Varley went on, “Precisely at that 
time, Petrel will detach from the 
squadron and set course for this 
point.” He stabbed at the center of 
the land mass in the right hand hem- 
isphere, and an asterisk glowed to 
mark the spot. 

“She will set down there with 
minimum time loss and put up a 
total screen so that she can not be 
detected.” 

Fletcher said, “Local people, Ad- 
miral?” 



“There are none. This is desert. 
You will know why when you get 
there. Nobody can live outside a ship 
without a life-support system. You 
will have to be very careful indeed.” 

Fletcher thought, “That’s going to 
make their day on Petrel. They had 
a long run of that on their last mis- 
sion.” But he said only, “Check.” 

“The squadron will put down at 
Cristinobyl, and I will pay the usual 
courtesy calls. Simpson will find out 
where the interned personnel are be- 
ing held and in twelve hours we shall 
be ready to act.” 

Simpson lifted his dark, conspira- 
tor’s face and gave unsmiling ac- 
knowledgment. 

Varley quickened his tone, having 
come to the vital part of the exposi- 
tion. “Fletcher will wait that twelve 
hours and then seek out and sever 
the equatorial energy ring which 
generates all the power used on Gar- 
amas. The confusion in the city will 
be total. It is estimated that their 
robot fault-finding gear will take a 
minimum of forty-five minutes to 
bring in temporary services. A cut- 
ting-out party will make its way into 
the prison quarter and effect the 
release of the internees. Certain 
agents in the city will take care of 
them and pass them along an escape 
line. We are only concerned with 
the I.G.O. agent. 

‘Timing will be important. There 
is a detailed schedule prepared. 
Withdrawal will be as arrival. The 
visit is only scheduled for twenty- 
four hours. As we leave, we will 
jam the tracking gear long enough 
for Petrel to lift off. Any questions?” 



12 



IF 




P etcher, conscious that as junior 
man he sihould have nothing to 
say but “yes,” put an awkward one. 
“Will not Garamas Security immedi- 
ately connect your visit with the 
power failure? Once down on the 
pad, the squadron will be limited to 
a defensive role. What is to stop 
them refusing clearance and insist- 
ing on a detailed search?” 

Varley gave him a straight look. 
“The report is basically what we 
came for. As you will understand, 
the agent does not have it with him. 
He will have to collect it from where 
it is hidden. That will be an added 
complexity. In the event which you 
describe, the agent would have to 
be destroyed. Once identified as an 
agent he would be open to inter- 
rogation methods which no one can 
resist. He will be prepared for that. 
You know the score. Commander. 
Do I have to spell it out?” 

If Fletcher was nettled by the im- 
plication, he did not show it. His 
face was impassive as he went on, 
“That is what I thought; but with 
Petrel available as a shuttle, not sub- 
ject to search, would it not be pos- 
sible to pick up the agent by scout 
car and take him out to R.V. with 
my car outside the city? Looking at 
the map there, I would say that a 
scout car could do the overland 
journey in three hours. In fact, we 
could take more of the escapees.” 
“Don’t let’s complicate this issue. 
Commander. What you suggest is 
possible. We will look at it. For one 
only, though: the I.G.O. agent. The 
rest can disperse as planned. It is 
less than six hours before Petrel 
should detach from the squadron 



and take independent course. You 
can work on your amendment with 
my staff.” 

He looked round the circle for any 
further query. There was none. 
“Very well. One more thing. Gara- 
mas is technologically advanced. As 
far as we know we can screen the 
ships from monitoring devices; but 
don’t count on it. Anything with a 
slant on this mission, however angl- 
ed, should be kept on maximum se- 
curity. Even inside a ship.” 

W ith the squadron dwindling on 
the port quarter, space seemed 
hugely empty again on the miniature 
scanner in Fletcher’s cabin. Its lone- 
liness found an echo in his own iso- 
lation in the hurrying corvette. Mo- 
mentarily his computer mind imagin- 
ed itself as a nucleus at the center 
of an infinity of Chinese boxes; a re- 
gression into nonexistence which was 
frightening. He forced himself to 
consider the detail of the mission 
ahead. 

After the course change, he had 
given Cotgrave a stand-down for 
two hours. That meant the crew 
could unseal and relax before the 
long chore at action stations which 
preceded a planetfall. There would 
be long enough confinement in suits 
if the weather in the streets on the 
desert side of Garamas was as Var- 
ley said. 

Final details had been hammered 
out in a long session with Varley 
and Frazer. They had agreed his plan 
and marked up an R.V. just outside 
the northeastern suburbs, where a 
green belt of parkland separated the 
city from its support zones. It would

13 




be a long run for PetreVs tiny scout 
car. Once he had fixed the sabotage 
angle he would take that chore him- 
self. 

Lying back on his acceleration- 
couch bimk he ran through the crew 
list. Cotgrave, his co-pilot, must 
stay with the ship. Bennet, Sluman 
and Hale in navigation were all good 
men. Bennet would go on the breach- 
ing job, then. He’d need an engineer 
— Hocker would do there. Power 
Two. Together with Engels and him- 
self that would be four. 

Once the decision was made his 
mind went into a freewheeling 
phase, and he slept deeply until the 
bleeps of a stations call brought him 
back to instant readiness. 

When he was circling slowly on 
his miniature command island with 
the corvette streaking in for a plan- 
etfall, he recognized that it had been 
the most difficult navigational task 
of his career. Without a prelimin- 
ary orbit and with no help from the 
ground, every bit of data had been 
won in microseconds by their own 
observation. Split second re-appraisal 
of course vectors had become an un- 
easy norm. 

Petrel flamed down in darkness 
like a glowing meteorite. In spite of 
the supposed human vacuum in the 
desert, Fletcher ran it as a standard 
military landing. Coolant gas billow- 
ed out to damp down thermal agi- 
tation before the corvette had flexed 
back on her hydraulic rams. Two 
minutes after planetfall, six men 
were fanned out on the ground and 
reporting back that the pad was 
clean. 

Farnley’s voice came precise, la- 



conic, making an objective assess- 
ment of a locale which could stand 
in for a traditional picture of hell: 
“Surface, shale and pumice. No veg- 
etation. Gauges reading fifty-six. 
Suggest limit of extra-vehicular ac- 
tivity at ten minutes.” 

Fletcher said, “Check. Come in, 
Alf.” 

Ill 

D awn on the desert side of Gar- 
amas was not held up by any 
contour. It flooded in as a quick- 
moving cadium-yellow tide over flat 
reaches of gravel to a circular hori- 
zon. 

Petrel was the sole physical fea- 
ture in the landscape, a gnomon on 
an immense sundial dish sitting as- 
tride a faint line of discoloration 
which was the only indicator of the 
buried generator ring. 

Dag Fletcher checked times and 
had his small scout car launched 
from its bay. Heat gauges began to 
bake. 

Bennet said, “Where do we cut 
the ring?” 

“Not here. If the power is any- 
thing like what they claim, there 
could be a local upheaval which 
would threaten the ship. Give it 
about ten kilometers. We breach it 
at 0800. Then the car has three 
hours to R.V.” 

They followed the marker line in 
a sprint to the horizon, with the draft 
of their passage throwing up a swirl 
of fine dust below the hurrying car 
and gauges marginally dropping 
back under ventilation. 

Bennet said, “Nothing to choose. 

IF 



14 




Only distance. Ten kilometers should 
be enough.” 

Hocker said, “Tlie chart shows a 
ravine like Grand Canyon. What’s 
happened to that, then?” 

“It was never an LG.O. survey. 
Could be a hundred kilometers either 
way.” 

Fletcher turned to Engels at the 
console. “Take her up to maximum 
height, and we’ll see what we can 
see.” 

The car went up like a free-stand- 
ing elevator, and the horizon reeled 
back to a smudgy bar. 

“That’s it.” 

Hovering over the gorge, they 
could appreciate the immensity of 
the project which powered Garamas. 

All of five kilometers wide, the 
vast gorge was spanned by a huge, 
striding viaduct. Its upper surface 
was the power ring itself, a tube 
twenty meters in diameter. It ran 
on the equatorial line all round the 
planet, like a hula hoop. Mere force 
of spin was enough to accelerate free 
particles in its composition into a 
centrifugal surge of energy. Simple 
but effective. 

Here, in the open, it was painted 
white. It was the painting that trig- 
gered off the alarm in Fletcher’s 
mind. Keeping it in that dazzling 
trim meant regular maintenance. 
And maintenance meant men; some- 
where down there would be an out- 
post for servicing personnel. 

He saw the squat, heat-insulated 
building built under the near rim of 
the gorge at the instant that Engels 
brought them down in a tightly 
banked turn on the desert. 

There was only one narrow slit of 



window looking directly out on to 
the gorge. At this time of day, un- 
less there was a deliberate watch 
kept, there was no reason to suppose 
that they had been seen. 

On the other hand, mere common 
sense dictated that they should as- 
sume that they had been. 

At the edge there was a change 
in texture noticable even through 
the thick foam-rubber of their boots. 
There was an apron of fine ashlar 
paving and the beginning of a ramp. 

It was a superbly engineered en- 
trance which melted into the lip of 
the gorge in complete camouflage. 
Zigzagging back under an overhang 
to the left, it led down to the blank 
face of a thickly insulated block- 
house. 

Already the suits were fighting a 
rearguard against the heat. Sweat 
running into his eyes, Fletcher said, 
“There has to be a way in. Look 
for a recessed lever.” 

Engels stumbled on it, banging 
the toe of a clumsy boot on a six- 
centimeter stub. He knelt down to 
get the full picture in direct vision 
through his visor. Then he squatted 
back on his heels like a hound dog 
and pointed at it with a bulky gaunt- 
leted fist. 

Fletcher said, “Okay, Alf, give it 
a shove.” 

They waited to a count of ten, 
facing the blank yellow wall. 

W hen the opening appeared, they 
were not immediately aware 
of it. By instinct they had expected 
it to be central, but it appeared at 
the far left, against the wall of the 
cliff. It was a low narrow slit, lead- 



PEACEMAKERS 



15 




ing into yellow depths, a miserly 
break in insulation. 

They dropped into a routine pat- 
tern of fire cover and movement, 
and by its logic Bennett arrived 
first at the center. 

Impression of a cool spacious 
chamber, as though deep in a natural 
cave. Panoramic view of the gorge 
through a long horizontal slit of win- 
dow, triple glazed in great depth to 
conserve refrigeration. Fully auto- 
mated system with two walls covered 
with computer units in serried ranks. 
Below the window, a long presenta- 
tion table and high stools. 

Engel checked the air and found 
it good. Suit gauges had dropped to 
twenty-four centigrade. With visors 
hinged back, they took stock. 

Bennett said, “After all, it’s only 
a couple of hours from Cristinobyl 
in a fast shuttle. No need for a per- 
manent detail.” 

Engels had been giving the equip- 
ment a professional eye. “Neat. Very 
neat. Tliere’s a half hoop sprayer 
running out with bearings grooved 
into the parapet of the duct. All 
done by mirrors.” 

They watched through the obser- 
vation window and saw a three- 
meter broad hoop with a flat plat- 
form like a howdah ride out from a 
point just below them. Engels stop- 
ped it and brought it back. “It’ll get 
you to the center span in under five 
minutes.” 

He was within seconds in his es- 
timate. Although used to having an 
infinity of space beneath their ship, 
there was something different about 
this naked contact with vertical free 
fall. Movement was slow and delib- 



erate, with the shiny shell of the 
tube below like a skating rink. 

One refinement of control which 
eluded the distant Engels was how 
to shut down the paint-spraying 
function. Driven with tremendous 
penetrative force, paint was atomiz- 
ed and surrounded the slowly mov- 
ing hoop in a fine mist. Suits turned 
from silver gray to a dazzling white 
carapace which made movement a 
hazard. 

Bennett, anchored by his lifeline 
and moving with infinite labor, used 
a vibrator to excavate an oblong 
cavity from the parapet. 

Then it was done. A calculated 
charge would lift out a ten-meter 
length of tube on a radio signal 
from Petrel. 

Fletcher called the ship. “She’s all 
set, and we’re coming in. Detonate 
on eleven hundred, whether we’re 
back or not. Expect us in fifteen 
minutes.” 

Why he put in that last gloss he 
could not tell. Everything was going 
according to plan. Better, in fact, 
than he had any right to expect, and 
it was there that the nudge of a 
sixth sense told him that it was prob- 
ably too well. 

Confirmation came when they 
climbed back into the blockhouse, 
and Engels soused them with a sol- 
vent he had found. When their visors 
were transparent again, he said, 
“Take a look at this inspection chart. 
If the periodicity is as I read it, 
we’re due for a visit today. No times. 
But I’d bet it would be early on. 
Give them a full day for whatever 
they have to do.” 

Bennett said slowly, *Tetrel will 

IF 



16 




be in sight on any reasonable ap- 
proach line from Cristinobyl.” 

It had already occurred to Fletch- 
er. She would be there all day, stuck 
up like a sore thumb through a 
sheet of brown paper. 

T he answer came as they were 
homing into the docking collar 
of the carport. Fie gave it to Cot- 
grave as though it had been there 
all the time. 

Fie said, “Call action stations, if 
you please, Mr. Cotgrave. Blast off 
as soon as you can make it. A short 
inter-continental flip to the coast. 
Northwest. Shortens the trip to R.V. 
and takes us out of line. As soon as 
you like.” 

“Inform Euro pa?'* 

“No.” 

“Varley expects us to be on this 
ref.” 

“Fie docs not expect us to give 
our presence away to the Garamas- 
ians.” 

IV 

F rom the coast, Fletcher pulled the 
plug on his bomb. Engels turned 
a startled face from his console. 
“Negative, Commander.” 
“Negative?” 

“It has not fired.” 

“You are sure?” 

“Believe me, at this distance a 
bursting paper bag would show up.” 
Fletcher checked times. “We can 
spare fifty-three minutes and still 
hit the R.V.” FFe called Bennett. 
“Car away. You, Engels, Flocker and 
myself. We can save time by going 
straight on from there.” 



Arrow swift, the small car had 
reeled back two hundred kilometers 
before Engels spoke again. Then he 
said, “It’ll be the paint.” 

“What’ll be the paint?” Bennett 
was genuinely puzzled. 

“Going out along the viaduct, that 
spraying gear put a new coat over 
the tube. You sited the device on the 
viaduct, right?” 

“Right.”^ 

“When we left there would be a 
drain back of surplus paint. Cover 
the whole bag of tricks.” 

“But it was closed.” 

“Very delicate gear that. Stagger- 
ed vents at the back to avoid in- 
creases in pressure due to heat. Paint 
vapor could get in there. Just enough 
goo to hold back a feather-light re- 
lay. But it will be ready to blow. 
A slight jar should do it.” 

“Like opening the box to see 
what’s going on.” 

“Like that.” 

Fletcher said mildly, “Well, just 
get thinking about it. There’s always 
a way round.” He was looking ahe^ 
in the miniature scanner and went 
on without a change of voice, “At 
the same time you can think about 
how to get past a large troop shuttle 
and a maintenance tender. They’re 
both down there by the block 
house.” 

Bennett said, “So the gear there 
was more sensitive than we knew. 
It called out a posse.” 

“Not while we were there.” En- 
gels was positive. “I got a line on 
every working unit in the setup. All 
very functional and busy with the 
power ring. I’d swear there was no 
monitor.”

Fletcher said, “Either way, they’re 
there, present, now. Put us down 
just below their horizon. Then cam- 
ouflage the car and go in at ground 
level.” 

E ngels took them down in a long 
glide and, before deceleration 
was total, Hocker was outside tug- 
ging at shift bars to alter micro- 
grooving in the outer skin and match 
the car’s color with the desert. From 
twenty meters out, standing in swirls 
of baking dust, Bennett ran a prag- 
matic check on his efforts and raised 
his arm to signal that the car had 
blended into its background. 

Then they were running forward 
at ground level like a smooth invisi- 
ble rat toward the two Garamasian 
shuttles. 

At half a kilometer, and still mov- 
ing in without a challenge, Fletcher 
took the firing grip of the laser tube 
which ran the whole length of the 
axis of the small car. He knew that 
what he had to do must constitute 
an act of war and would be death 
to the purpose of the mission, unless 
it was a hundred per cent successful. 

He called for height, and Engels 
took them up in a steep climb. Then 
he said, “Right along the spine,” 
and they went down like a mosqui- 
to homing on a succulent flank. 

Belatedly, two guards spilled out 
from the transport, both in clumsy 
refrigeration gear like a collection 
of oblong boxes. Carbine fire using 
glowing tracer lifted lazy lines which 
the car crossed in a succession of 
hammer blows, then the laser was 
breaking up the shuttle. 

It appeared to melt, plates turn- 



ing to molecular scrap. A puff of 
black smoke came from its rounded 
bows, laced immediately with ver- 
milion flame. 

Fletcher switched to a wide-scat- 
ter paralyzing ray and sprayed the 
area. 

Engels was down beside the main- 
tenance tender. They spilled out, 
spoiling the effect of special branch 
cops making a raid by the comic 
clumsiness of their bulky suits. 

The tender was empty. Hocker 
sprayed a line of holes through its 
console. 

Fletcher went forward on hands 
and knees, like a fat grub, and shov- 
ed out an extensor periscope to look 
over the rim. Down below, the nar- 
row door was shut; but two high- 
shouldered Garamasians stood on 
either side of the ramp, with squat 
carbines held incongruously across 
their chests. 

He appeared briefly in their limit- 
ed visual field and, as the muzzles 
were lifting towards him, sprayed 
them once on a wide angle. They 
leaned back on the block-house wall, 
too stiffly clad to fall down. 

Bennett shoved over the stub lever, 
and the heavy door began its ponder- 
ous swing back. 

A round-headed Garamasian en- 
gineer. out of his salamander kit, 
showing the typical, lanky high- 
shouldered development of his eth- 
nic stock, was making a wide gesture 
with narrow hands which made it 
clear even to an observer from an- 
other world that he was telling them 
that he knew there had been intrud- 
ers in the hive. 

He was still working at it when 

IF 



18 




the beam fixed him that way like a 
butterfly on a pin. 

Fletcher said, “Shovel them over 
to the back wall and clear that spray- 
ing line. Where does it load with 
paint?” 

Engels the expert said, “It doesn’t 
need any more paint. It only did 
half the crossing. It’s got a fair load 
still on board.” 

“Empty it out. Fill it with solvent. 
Set it to move out. We can be on 
the way to the R.V. before it frees 
the relay.” 

Hocker asked, “Suppose it doesn’t 
work?” 

“Keep your fingers crossed. Be- 
cause if it doesn’t you’ll have to go 
out yourself and tap it with a ham- 
mer.” 

“Why me?” 

“I’ll overlook that, Hocker, this 
one time. For now you can go up 
top and keep an eye on the desert. 
Don’t question anything that moves. 
Just blast it.” 

“Check, Commander.” 

W orking methodically, Engels 
had cleared the sprayer and 
was rinsing its saddle tanks with sol- 
vent. When it was refilled he ran it 
for ten meters and then brought it 
back. 

“Solvent goes out faster than 
paint. But paint capacity is enough 
for a full trip, so I reckon this will 
make the center. All set. Command- 
er.” 

“Let it go, then. How long do 
you say?” 

“Five minutes.” 

“I can’t afford to risk the car. 
We’ll get over the horizon and head 



back immediately after the blowout” 
As the car rose, they could see 
the length of the viaduct, an engin- 
eering marvel in its own right, car- 
rying the glistening white tube across 
the gorge. Fletcher imagined it go- 
ing on below the land surface, cros- 
sing seas, the patient work of skilled 
men. 

It was the first time he had been 
cast in the role of saboteur, and it 
went against the grain. Whatever re- 
port was to be brought out, it would 
need to be red-hot to justify their 
action. On the other hand, there 
was something about the snug neu- 
trality of Garamas which was un- 
acceptable. No planet could be un- 
committed. Those that were not 
strong for the law were in reality 
working against it. 

He recognized that he was find- 
ing excuses. Every human mind has 
a built-in necessity to think well of 
itself. This was his rationalization. 
Short-circuiting the internal debate 
he said, “That’s far enough. Put her 
down. One minute to go.” 

When it came it was different 
from any other explosive sound he 
had ever heard — even allowing for 
the filter effect of the listening gear. 

There was a high-pitched scream 
rising and cutting off as it passed 
beyond audio frequency. Seconds 
later the car rocked in a Force Nine 
gust, bringing a hail of dust and 
small trash. Every dial on the con- 
sole went into a crazy spin as though 
under a freak magnetic storm. Then 
there was silence. 

Fletcher said, “Back, then,” and 
the car went up in a steeply banked 
turn.

For a hundred meters from the 
point of fracture, the huge tube had 
peeled free from its supporting via- 
duct. On the far side, the force had 
thrown the broken end down, and the 
tube sagged away towards the floor 
of the gorge. The block-chouse end 
had reared up like an elephant’s 
trunk and was holding an uneasy 
stability as a high, swaying tower. 

Only two or three meters of the 
center span of the viaduct had been 
breached. It was a neat job of dem- 
olition. But Fletcher saw it as a 
wound in the ring of solidarity forg- 
ed by professional men. He felt like 
a murderer who would now give 
much to staunch the flow of blood. 

V 

XTobody in the block-house ap- 
peared to have moved. Engels 
said, “They’ll have pinpointed that 
break as of now. There’ll be a trou- 
ble-shooting gang on the way.” 

They left the Garamasians parked 
round the walls like ritual sacrifices 
in a mast aba. Hocker, last out, took 
a minute to pose the end one in a 
nose-thumbing gesture towards the 
open door. Then they were streak- 
ing over hot, brown desert for the 
R.V. 

With just over two thousand kilo- 
meters to go Engels locked the car 
on its maximum speed just below 
the sonic ceiling, and its auto-pilot 
took over. 

Now they were across the first 
strait, leapfrogging a chain of islands 
that were not much more than atolls, 
with a still magenta sea washing 
white crystal beaches. 



The car raced on, a slight, hurry- 
ing shadow across empty shores. En- 
gels said, “Mainland coming up. 
Commander. If the chart tells no lie 
there’s nothing on this course except 
automated farm spreads.” 

Even they were enough. An un- 
familiar machine crossing the home- 
stead would be enough to have the 
resident agricultural engineer grab- 
bing for a video. 

“Level out. Set for half a meter 
over hedge height. They’ll have some 
trouble with identification at this 
speed.” 

Now it was useless to look for 
topographical features. So close to 
the ground, they were virtually fly- 
ing blind in a dizzying welter of 
melting shapes. 

With fifteen minutes to go, Engels 
dropped them neatly in an irrigation 
ditch, where they sat across the gap 
like a custom-built bridging plug. 
The chart showed less than five kilo- 
meters to R.V., but they were now 
moving into the outer ring of com- 
muter development. Top executive 
country, isolated house units sur- 
rounded by private parkland. 

They took time off to unseal, 
methodically stacking the gear in 
roof slots above each seat. The tiny 
car seemed to double in inside room. 
Even then there was only a cubic 
meter of space in the loading bay 
for their passenger. 

With ten minutes to go Fletcher 
said, “Okay. Take it up. Steady now, 
pick your way through the trees.” 

Almost at once, they found an 
outer-ring monorail and crossed it, 
hugging the ground beneath a hun^ 
dred-meter span. There were four 



20 



IF 




kilometers of rolling parkland with- 
out sight of human life before En- 
gels swept over a long gentle rise to 
meet the monorail again, hidden in 
a shallow valley, the next spiral in. 

They were on to it before he could 
alter course. Too late he saw two 
stationary shuttles dead ahead, with 
Garamasian top people looking out 
from a row of crystal viewing ports. 

Round heads set like ornamental 
roundels on narrow, high-shouldered 
trunks. Blue tunics of the top exec- 
utive grade, with narrow stand-up 
collars which completely covered 
rudimentary necks. Lidless eyes, 
dark disks of polished obsidian mis- 
sing nothing. Except one, facing the 
window in sleep with optical facets 
turned away and dull gray blanks 
presented to the familiar view. 

As Engels dropped them down in 
a crash stop where their microgroove 
skin texture would give them almost 
complete camouflage, the bulletlike 
silver shuttles began to move. 

F etcher said, “They’ve cleared the 
fault. Smart work that. Must 
have sent a big party out to the 
desert. They’ll be looking round for 
who did them dirt. Now this lot will 
be falling over each other to get to 
a video. Move it along, Alf. Don’t 
worry about being seen,” 

Engels took them up to a meter 
over tree-top height, and for a 
moment the car was as still as 
though it had been painted there. It 
began to turn as he lined it up on the 
direction beam. Then they were 
homing at full thrust on the tiny 
glowing mark of the R.V. set up on 
the miniature navigation spread. 



Fletcher had time to think that 
technological refinements were all 
right, but when you came right down 
to it, you got no greater accuracy 
than you fed in. If Bennett was a 
fraction out in his original plot, they 
might very well be going all out for 
a local gendarmerie. 

The thought led him to take a 
checking run along the co-ordinates, 
Bennett’s voice brought him back 
to direct vision. 

Now they were amongst buildings. 
Blind to the road in the Garamasian 
fashion, grouped round inner courts, 
inward-looking. Typical of a desert- 
founded ecology. 

“There she is!” 

A small scout car identical with 
•the one they were in was sliding to 
a halt beside a group of eucalyptus 
trees. 

Engels said, “That’s Hawk*s car.” 

Then they were alongside, and 
Cameron himself was crossing the 
gap in full space gear with his visor 
binged back. 

His hair seemed more aggressively 
red in Garamasian daylight, and 
there was no doubting the urgency 
in his voice. “Nice, Fletcher. Right 
on the button. As well, too. There’s 
a big thing on. Our ploy worked out, 
the agent’s here; but there’s border- 
line revolution in the city. Fascist 
lot taking over. Very dicey situation 
all round. Just as well you’re taking 
this agent out; we’ve already had a 
check from security, and they’ll be 
back. Anyway, see you.” 

While he spoke a small figure, 
bulky in an I.G.O. suit with the 
identity flashes of a communications 
lieutenant, had taken Bennett’s hand 



22 



IF 




and been hauled up into the cubic 
meter of cargo space. 

Fletcher said, “Right, Jock. We’ve 
been seen, by the way, so the hunt 
will be on. For the record you could 
claim to have been out to the outer 
mono rails on a sight-seeing trip. See 
you.” 

Engels was moving them out be- 
fore the hatch closed. 

They saw Hawk^s car spin on its 
axis and beat away in a dragonfly 
flash of iridescence; then they were 
running on a direct course at maxi- 
mum thrust, ten meters above the 
highest building. 

Hocker was concentrating on a 
circular scan to check for Garamas- 
ian atmosphere craft. Engels was 
fully committed with the pilotage 
chore. Bennett began a recheck of 
his navigational set for the home 
run, reasonably concerned that they 
should make a first-time hit. Con- 
sequently it was Fletcher, the drone, 
who had time to chat up the inmate 
of the loading pen. 

He turned in his bucket seat, pre- 
pared to knock on the man’s helmet 
to signal this civil intent and stopped 
with his clenched fist two centimet- 
ers from a neat, platinum blonde 
head. 

C opying the style of her new 
crewmates, a silvery Fingalnan 
girl had wriggled, chrysalislike, out 
of her borrowed gear. She was sit- 
ting crosslegged in the lotus suit, 
wearing a taut, lime-green inner suit 
which could have been sprayed' on 
by a miserly makeup man, who had 
to do a couple of hundred of them 
with one small can. 



Making a display of her cosmo- 
politan expertise, she leaned forward 
with outstretched hand in Earth-style 
greeting. He automatically took it, 
reminded at once that the Fingalnian 
metabolism kept its children’s blood 
a good five degrees hotter than his 
own. It was like holding a warm 
polystyrene glove. 

She said in English, “Xenia, Com- 
mander. Delighted to meet you, I 
think.” 

Low-pitched and husky, contriv- 
ing to build communication on a 
carrier-wave of warm enthusiasm as 
though she had only been bom for 
this day, her voice triggered a quite 
disproportionate reaction. 

Three more heads whipped round, 
and the car banked sharply under 
Engels’s convulsive grip. 

Gallant Hocker said, “Stone me, 
it’s a she-male. Sitting on that ribbed 
floor is no good for a delicate spirit. 
Come and sit with me.” 

He even held out his hands to 
lift her over. 

“That is very thoughtful of you, I 
think. But I am still on duty. Some 
other time, I think. Meanwhile, hel- 
lo.” 

Her wide open green eyes had 
never left Fletcher’s, and what she 
saw there seemed to bring her to a 
decision. 

Hocker was ready to go on with 
his ploy, but Fletcher said coldly. 
“Save it. Lieutenant. Get on with 
that scan, or there may not be an- 
other time.” 

To Xenia he said, “Forgive us for 
being surprised. We were expecting 
a man. It is not easy to believe that 
anyone so beautiful is an agent.”

•*Is that complimentary or not, 
Coanmander? Espionage is necessary. 
This weport I have may save many 
lives, I thinik.” 

He remembered that Fingalnians 
had particular difficulty with the “r” 
in Earth languages. In Xenia’s hands 
the defect was a positive gain, but 
it made it even harder to take her 
seriously. 

“Of course, I was not under-valu- 
ing your work. You have the re- 
port?” 

An amused gleam in the green 
eyes told him that she appreciated 
what considerations had triggered 
off that question. “Yes, it is vewy 
small** 

It would need to be, and any 
confusion was entirely on his side. 

“Don’t fwet about the weport, 
Commander. It’s been on my mind a 
long time. I haven’t lost it yet. How 
much time do we have?” 

“Three hours to reach the ship. 
Then we wait for the signal to lift 
off. Perhaps two hours after that. 
Has to key in with a jamming trans- 
mission from the squadron so that 
Petrel can get out unnoticed by their 
monitoring stations.” 

They had crossed ithe first mono- 
rail circuit and were well inside the 
executive belt. She said, “This we- 
port could be made out of date any- 
way by your action in getting it out. 
The fascists have been waiting for 
a national cwisis, and you’ve made 
it. I know you had to do it this 
way; but it’s just what they wanted** 

Fletcher said, “Perhaps the gov- 
ernment will believe that they chose 
the Squadron visit as an opportune 
time and engineered the breakdown 



themselves — hoping that I.G.O. 
would get the blame.” 

“You are clever. Commander. 
That could happen. So it would pay 
them to see that you get away. Per- 
fect scapegoat for them. If they 
get power, they’ll definitely take 
Gawamas into the O.G.A. sphere of 
influence v/hether they declare it 
openly or not.” 

“And the more dangerous if not 
openly.” 

“Exactly so, I think.” 

“Who are the fascist leaders?” 
“Mainly fwom this awea. Indus- 
twialists with something to lose if 
Gwamas adopts the full I.G.O. char- 
ter on human wights, I think. Their 
headquarters is the Gawamasian Ag- 
wicultuwal Club. That will be the 
command post for any putsch,**

F etcher turned away. Outside, they 
were crossing the last of the 
suburban belt, and the precisely 
squared out food-production areas 
rolled away to the distant horizon. 
Spaced with mathematical exacti- 
tude, the headquarter buildings of 
each section stood out like plotted 
quantities on a lattice. One of them 
would hold the action group which 
wanted Garamas to move back to 
medieval political thinking. 

It would be easy to take the view 
that it was no business of his. He 
had a clear mission and no man- 
date to move a centimeter outside it. 
Indeed, any move other than to get 
Xenia and her report to a place of 
safety was definitely against orders. 
He could be executed for failure. So

what? What indeed was he thinking 
of? Xenia’s fragile beauty dedicated 
to a dangerous trade had presented 
him afresh with the issue of responsi- 
bility which was never far below the 
surface of his mind. 

A gloss from a theology tape of 
his college era quoted itself in the 
clear tones of a female recording 
clerk. Not dissimilar from Xenia’s 
— which was probably the grapnel 
which had dredged it up. No lisp 
though and a lot less sexy. “To him 
that knows to do good and does not 
do it. To that man, that is sin.” 

Xenia’s warm, light hand on his 
shoulder supplemented the commun- 
ication possibilities of her voice, now 
as intimate as it could well get. They 
might have been alone in the car. 

She said, “Exactly so.” 

Bennett, the only one listening, 
looked puzzled by an apparent non 
sequitur, Dag Fletcher met her eyes, 
and the tiny nod of her head con- 
firmed his questioning look. In ad- 
dition to her more outstanding 
charms, she was a telepath. He won- 
dered briefly how she had reacted 
to unspoken speculation about where 
she was keeping the report. Saw her 
smile again and deliberately fell back 
on learned skills to keep thought out 
of the transfer areas of his mind. 

His success in so doing got him 
a credit. She said, “You’re vewy 
quick, Commander. But too late. I 
agree with your position. It comes 
down to individual wesponsibility. 
You can’t twust any wuling clique. 
Not one. That’s what I like about 
I.G.O., mainly staffed by civilians 
like yourself doing their stint. Going 
back to ordinawy jobs, so they know 



they’ll be at the weceiving end of 
any wegulations they make. Here, 
now, there’s a chance for us to do 
something about the setup.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I know where the Agwicultiiral 
Club is. You could dwop a small 
neutwalizer on it.” 

She read his instinctive rejection 
and its grounds. “You’re thinking 
about me again. I can look after 
that old weport. If we do this, it 
won’t be so important anyway.” 

“If it’s their command center, 
they’ll have guards and some mili- 
tary potential. It would be an un- 
justifiable risk.” 

“Individual wesponsibility, com- 
mander. Now you know the oppor- 
tunity we have, you can’t just shwug 
it off.” 

He saw that they were deep in 
the food-producing belt. Not even a 
collection center in sight in any di- 
rection. He was acting at an instinc- 
tive level when he said, “Take us 
down. There by the purple hedge.” 

A giowing asterisk on the chart 
spread marked their position. 
Xenia leaned tautly forward and ex- 
tended a slim silvery aim to point 
out the location of the headquarters. 

Hocker had not said a word, but 
she said, ‘To save you wasteful use 
of time. Lieutenant, the answer is 
no. Just concentwate on the mis- 
sion.” 

He was visibly taken aback; but 
the look she got needed no telepathic 
power to interpret. She had not made 
a good friend. 

Bennett, who had pieced enough 
together to know that a detour was

being considered, said, “That’s two 
hundred kilometers. Not all loss; 
triangulated from there it only means 
about another one-fifty on the total 
journey. Minutes only. It depends 
what has to be done when you get 
there.” 

Dag Fletcher faced the personal 
decision at a level not accessible to 
Xenia’s interception. She waited with 
the rest for it to receive a clothing 
in words. He said, “Alter course. 
Take a look at that reference. Make 
the last ten kilometers at ground 
level.” « 

She had the general drift of it, 
however, when the first two words 
were out in overt speech, and warm 
arms went quickly round his neck 
in a brief hug that left an impression 
of unexpected strength and a linger- 
ing trace of an exotic and unfamili- 
ar scent. 

It took less than five minutes be- 
fore Engels set them down in the 
shelter of a squat irrigation unit 
housed in a white adobe cube. They 
could hear the rhythmic beat of a 
pump working like an isolated heart. 

Fletcher sent up a pencil-slim per- 
iscope and took a long look at the 
blank wall of the club premises. It 
was indistinguishable from any other 
headquarter building which sat in the 
center of each precisely calculated 
admin district. It lay half a kilometer 
distant, across a fidd carrying a 
mauve, heatherlike crop of protein- 
rich erichthonius plant. 

The field went all the way round 
on the right flank. Left, a low hedge 
ran directly to the corner, dividing 
off another production area, lying 
fallow and showing up as a tidy 



spread of yellow ochre corrugations. 

A darker line amongst the furrows 
claimed his attention, and he was de- 
ciding that it was a surface road 
leading to the house, when Xenia 
said, “All these places have direct 
access underground to the monorail 
circuit. Supplies come in and pwo- 
ducts go out that way.” 

Movement from the distant road 
made a period. A long, olive-drab 
hovercar, slug-shaped, flying a ma- 
roon pennant, appeared briefly on 
the periphery of vision and swept 
out of sight at the side of the build- 
ing. 

There was an urgency about it 
which confirmed in his mind that 
they were at the right place. If that 
was so, however, the small scout car 
would hardly be allowed to hover 
overhead choosing a good target 
for a depth charge. No doubt at all, 
the plain brick facade would con- 
ceal a fortress. 

Fletcher 'flicked the eyepiece shut 
and set his periscope to retract. Be- 
fore the tip had clicked softly into 
its housing, he knew what he had to 
do. He said quietly, “Hocker, get 
yourself outside and cut a hole in 
this wall. Go in and top the pump.” 

When Hocker was busy making 
a circular incision with a vibrator 
from the car’s external tool rack, 
he went on, “Whatever else they do 
here, they must keep the district 
working.”- 

'Hocker disappeared through his 
seal hole. Xenia was leaning forward 
breathing warmly down Fletcher’s 
neck, a distracting intimacy which 
made him too much aware of her 
physical presence; uncomfortably

underlined by the knowledge that 
she knew he knew she knew. 

The pump went out. Two minutes 
later a clumsy, angular silver^gray 
maintenance tender was rounding the 
blind corner of the facing wall. 

Engels said, “Efficient, whatever 
else.” 

The tender was lightly made, with 
huge inflated wheels. It rolled over 
the crop without causing damage. It 
stopped on the opposite side, and 
they watched the scanner for a close- 
grain picture of the developing 
scene. 

T wo Garamasians jumped down 
from the high seat. A comedy 
partnership. One very tall, the other 
shorter, a geometric design of two 
balancing spheres. Gray coveralls 
with maroon armbands to show 
membership of the nationalist party. 
Breast-pocket flashes to show status 
as agricultural engineers. The fat 
one carried a cranked key like a 
winding handle and shoved the busi- 
ness end home in a slot which was 
invisible to the watchers. Then he 
began to turn it. 

Dag Fletcher had seen enough. 
He was moving silently out before 
the man had completed one revolu- 
tion. They saw him check the setting 
of his laser for its wide-angle stun- 
ning beam, and then he was through 
the hole in a smooth flow of effort. 

Whatever the inside of the pump 
room was like, it could not have 
been immediately obvious that there 
was a hole in its protective shell, be- 
cause both men went in. On the 
count of five Hocker reappeared at 
the hole. 



“Stay here with the car. WeTe 
going to have a look inside.” He 
pulled a strap pouch from its ceiling 
clip and put in it two charges from 
the rack. “If we’re not back in fif- 
teen minutes you’re to set a course 
for Petrel. Take off according to 
schedule.” 

He was sliding hack the hatch 
when Xenia hazarded vivisection by 
slipping through the narrowing gap 
to join him. 

Standing at ground level, the top 
of her head was well below his 
shoulder — a miniature Boucher, 
now seen to be wearing a broad flex- 
ible metallic belt over her minimal 
green tights with a short, narrow- 
bladed knife hanging from it in an 
elect rum sheath. 

“Not you, midget.” 

The knife was pricking into his 
navel before he could lift a hand. 
Something very clear in her green 
eyes warned him that she would just 
as soon push it right in as not. He 
thought, “Why should I sweat? Let 
clever bloody Fletcher sort her out.” 
He simply shrugged and finished 
closing the port. 

Hocker said, “That little silver 
hint followed me out. I told her to 
get back. I reckon she must have 
thought better of it and done that.” 

“Okay. Let’s get on.” 

Sitting on a high bench seat, Dag 
Fletcher found that he was facing 
a completely unfamiliar set of instru- 
mentation. The buggy was however 
quietly vibrating, so its power pack 
was in service. 

Out from a plain bulkhead under 
the windshield, two rods, one white 
and one black, curved out and seem-

ed to fall naturally to the hands of 
anyone in the driving seat. 

Methodically checking out possi- 
bilities he tried to move them up, 
then left, then right. It was not until 
he pulled them both down that there 
was a soft click of engagement, and 
they were moving straight forward. 
Now he could feel lateral play and 
tried moving his left hand out. The 
buggy swung on its tracks turning 
right. 

Then he got the trick of it. Both 
down for straight on. Left or right, 
feed power into the drive on that 
side, so that the buggy spun on the 
slowing wheels and went in the con- 
trary direction to hand movement. 
Once grasped, it was easy; and he 
made a fast run across the field to 
the house wall. 

From underneath, it was a tower- 
ing slab of masonry. Solid as a cliff. 
Too huge to be so featureless. They 
rounded the corner in a controlled 
spin and trundled on. Precisely in 
the center of the side, the approach 
road ran into the thickness of the 
building as though into a mine, 

Fletcher spun the buggy into the 
entrance, and they saw fifty meters 
of oblong section tunnel lit by brilli- 
ant lighting ports in the roof and 
painted white. There was no opera- 
tor in sight, but as they approached 
a maroon and white check barrier 
began to lift like a portcullis. 

The buggy was obviously recog- 
nized and given official welcome by 
a scanning eye. 

At the end of the run they came 
out into a central courtyard. The 
external severity of design was be- 
lied by a profusion of color. 



The entire floor was paved with 
red and white squares of ridged tile. 
In the center was an oblong pool 
with violent color patches of merope 
bushes apparently growing from its 
indigo surface. Entirely of translu- 
scen brick, the inner wall glowed 
with light. At ground level open 
colonnades led from the courtyard 
into the building. Right, the olive- 
drab car was drawn up at a semi- 
circular entrance port. Left, a more 
utilitarian working area was laid out 
with parking space for farm plant. 
Beyond the pool, a number of mili- 
tary^-dcsign hovercars with the ma- 
roon pennant of the organization 
were drawn up. 

F letcher swung around to join the 
farm vehicles. A round head 
lifted from some desk-bound chore 
and watched incuriously as he ran 
into an empty bay. But he could hot 
expect that they would get far with- 
out a challenge. 

In answer to a question framed 
only at mental level, Xenia’s voice 
came from beneath the buggy. 
“Their operations room is under the 
main block. Through that portico 
and down.” 

She wriggled free from the an- 
gled chassis members which had 
supported her and stood beside 
them. 

It was useless to make anything 
of it. Fletcher said, “You seem to 
know all about it.” 

She appreciated his realistic ac- 
ceptance and went on. “These 
places are all on the same plan. If 
you’ve seen one, you’ve seen the lot. 
And they all have an underground 



28 



IF 




complex. Stowage and civil defense. 
The internment building was just 
like this.” 

“And of course you had the run 
of it,” Hooker said. 

“I was a very pwivileged pwison- 
er.” 

“I’ll bet you were.” 

“All we have to do is to get 
inside the building. Anywhere at 
all. I can show you.” 

Only twenty-five meters distant, 
the farm office block was the ob- 
vious target. 

Reading Fletcher’s line of thought, 
Xenia said, “You want a diversion. 
Why not send one of these bug- 
gies over the yard to cwash into 
that tidy line? The end one. When 
I was underneath I could see the 
contwols move. I’ll do it from un- 
derneath.” 

His conditional agreement was 
still unspoken, when she had slipped 
away under the wheels. Seconds 
later they heard the end buggy be- 
gin its destructive run. 

It skirted the edge of the pool, 
picking up speed until it was wad- 
dling along at a good thirty kilo- 
meters in the hour. Then it was do- 
ing its best to climb over the mid- 
dle car of the waiting line. 

Reaction was immediate and posi- 
tive. Suddenly the courtyard was full 
of high-shouldered Garamasians. 
Conformation that this was no simple 
farm center came at the same time: 
All the new arrivals were in mili- 
tary uniform and carried machine 
pistols. 

With all the movement in the 
direction of the crashed vehicle, 
Xenia led the way under the colon- 



nade and through the nearest en- 
trance. They were in a circulation 
corridor which ran all the way round 
the building. Without hesitation, she 
picked an arched opening leading 
off and went through it like a silver 
rabbit on the home run. Ramp on 
a spiral leading down, lit by oval 
ceiling ports. 

At the second turn, a Garamasian 
hurried up and was blasted by Hoc- 
ker with a yell frozen in his gullet. 
They left him leaning against the 
wall with his eye disks rolled to 
gray blanks. 

Xenia said, “Each floor follows 
the same plan. We need to be over 
the other side.” 

They were running now, foot- 
steps beating a light tattoo on the 
parquet. At the second corner, she 
said, “Round this one there will be 
a beam barrier.” 

If there was it was not apparent. 
Smooth white walls ran away to 
a darker-hued distant rectangle 
where a right-angled turn brought in 
the opposite wing. 

Hocker said, “Stalemate, then,” 
and crumpled forward to the tiled 
floor. 

Xenia’s lips were framing, “Don’t 
worry about that weport,” but it was 
never uttered. Men in olive-drab 
uniform, moving like trained sol- 
diers, were swarming in the corri- 
dor where sentry niches set in the 
walls had sliced open. 

Many hands made light work of 
carrying the aliens to a point half- 
way down the corridor where a wide 
opening on the left led to the 
underground operations room they 
had come to seek. They passed a 



PEACEMAKERS 



29 




low-ceilinged crush hall and were 
taken into the lofty nei*ve center 
itself. 

Round the walls, men in green 
uniforms looked round indifferent- 
ly before turning again to the wink- 
ing lights of a communication net- 
work. Operators, shoving magnetized 
disks along route lines on a wall- 
sized operations map, rested on their 
billiard cues. But it was left for a 
select group round the board-room 
table in the middle of the floor to 
take executive action. A paunchy 
type at the head of the table looked 
up and said in a harsh, grating 
voice, “Set them in the analyzer. 
Quickly now. There is no time to 
waste.” 

VII 

W hen his head cleared, and the 
convoluted, white mists roll- 
ed back to extend his vision out- 
ward from a still black center, Dag 
Fletcher was on the specimen’s side 
of a large lens looking up into the 
eye of a busy researcher. He was 
lying in a convenient coffin-shaped 
box with his neck on a padded 
rest. Then centimeters from his face 
the curved glass of the lens filled 
the aperture from edge to edge. 
Electrode plates pressing on his 
skull both prevented any movement 
and set up a tension Which was on 
the threshold of destructive pain. 

It was, with all its strangeness, 
recognizable enough. Any advanced 
culture in the galaxy could set it up, 
one way or another. He was hooked 
to a bug that could tap the inmost 
secrets of his mind. Whatever he 



thought, bawdy, humorous, treadier- 
ous, kindly, cruel, picayime or full 
of ultimate truth as an egg, was all 
there for them to see. A mind nake<P 
and ashamed. 

Working at it, however, he filled 
its surface channels with frivolity. 
Xenia, since she was nearest at 
hand in experience. He set himself 
to do an identikit portrait which 
they could throw on their screen if 
they liked. Straight, aristocratic nose, 
level brows, serious mouth of a 
voluptuary, small round chin. Being a 
mathematician he recognized that 
like nature she was profoundly sym- 
metrical and proportionate. A num- 
ber sequence. 1. 2. 3. 5. 8. 13. 21. 
34. 55 developed as he considered the 
claims of her body structure to 
satisfy the strict requirements of 
the Golden Section. 

A grating voice penetrated the 
privacy of his box, speaking in Gara- 
masian. 

From somewhere left he heard 
Xenia herself giving a helpful word. 
“Are you thinking about me, Dag? 
That’s nice.” 

Then the harsh commentator once 
more, this time in the lingua franca^ 
of the galaxy, “It is no use. Com- 
mander. We already know all about 
your ship. Your lieutenant has given 
us all we need to know. Unfortun:^ 
ately I do not think we can catch 
up with your patrol car, but there 
is still time to have the ship in- 
tercepted.” 

Xenia said, speaking quickly, “But 
they can’t do that, Dag. It would 
show their hand too soon. We have 
only ourselves to worry about and 
that . .” Her voice cut off in 



30 



IF 




an involuntary screen. Some linguist 
had caught the drift of her argu- 
ment and used direct means to cut 
it off. 

More Garamasian gobbledcgook, 
and he felt the container he was in 
was beginning to move. 

From being horizontal, he was 
now tipping forward, pivoting at 
a point somewhere near shoulder 
level. Finally he was upright, with 
weight taken largely on his feet, but 
a certain spinestretching tension still 
present from the head stall. Now he 
could see the operations room 
through the distorting lens in front 
of him, like a view through the 
wrong end of a binocular. 

At the head of the table, seem- 
ingly at the end of a long tunnel, 
the man who was calling the shots 
looked like a piranha. Underslung 
jaw, open, rubbery mouth, bland 
noseless face, bloated trunk stretch- 
ing away below the shiny table top. 

I t was not a lot better when the 
glass screen was swung away and 
he saw that the man was less than 
ten meters distant. Sitting next to 
him like an A.D.C. was a lean, blue- 
white Scotian, motionless, reptilian 
eyes looking away left, no doubt at 
the more rewarding tableau of 
Xenia. On the table in front of 
them was the pouch with their 
charges. 

Fletcher said, “Garamas enjoys 
neutral status. You have no right 
to imprison I.C.O. personnel. If you 
have any charges to make, your 
government will deal with the mat- 
ter.” 

“I can tell you, since you will 



have no use for the information, 
that we are the government. The 
neutral status you speak of will 
not be of long duration. There is no 
future for Garamas with the mealy- 
mouthed I.G.Q. alliance. I am 
sure our Scotian friends will be very 
glad to have two serving officers 
with knowledge of I.G.O. affairs. 
They are very skilled at breaking 
down reluctant contributors. De- 
structive, but thorough.” 

Mind-racing to find any small ad- 
vantage, Fletcher was only half 
listening. Under pressure, heightened 
by stress he thought he heard Xenia 
whispering quietly from somewhere 
left. Then he recognized that the 
voice was in his own mind. 

“Dag. We’re on the same fre- 
quency. Think with me. These mind 
taps are very finely balanced. To- 
gether we can send a surge back 
up the spout that might wreck the 
box. Think with me. Very angry. 
Destroy. Destroy.” 

Piranha-face was going on. An- 
other quickly choked gasp of pain 
from Xenia brought all the anger 
Fletcher could feel into his mind. 
That and admiration for her which 
was involuntary and independent of 
sex. 

Silence from the floor and sud- 
den quick movement from beside 
his box. Movement that was too 
late to throw a circuit balancer and 
stop a surge back along the deli- 
cate wiring of the cephelograph. 

There was a small plosive pop 
and an acrid smell of a burned-out 
dielectric. Fletcher was at the same 
time conscious of a bonus which 
they had not planned for. The fail- 



PEACEMAKERS 



31 




ing circuit had tripped the relay 
which fed magnetic grips holding 
heir wrists and ankles. He sensed 
simultaneously that Xenia too had 
recognized it, and he said directly 
:o her mind, “Good girl. Now! Both 
together — out and grab for King 
Log!” 

He had a confused impression of 
many heads turned inward to watch 
the developing scene and the move- 
ment of one guard quicker off the 
mark than the others. Tlien he dived 
for the shiny table top and went 
along it on a sliding tackle that 
brought him to its head. 

Piranha-face had opened his fish 
mouth and had struggled to his feet 
when the Earthman’s arm clamped 
round his neck. Fletcher heard a 
confused struggle behind him and 
expected at any moment to feel the 
hammer thump of an old-fashioned 
slug tearing into his back. But he 
had twisted round his victim and got 
his own shoulders against a solid 
wall before anything had a chance to 
develop. 

He saw that Hocker, slower off 
the mark, had been grabbed by two 
Garamasian guards. While he watch- 
ed, one of them brought up a ma- 
chine pistol and clubbed it on the 
side of his head. Hocker went limp, 
and they let him fall. 

Xenia, a flash of quicksilver, was 
beside him. Her lime-green inner 
suit had been reduced to a fragmen- 
tary monokini, and blood welled 
from two long incisions from throat 
to navel. In her hand she carried 
her own small knife, stained to the 
hilt with blood which was not all 
her own. 



L eaning against the cephelograph 
box she had left, was a tall 
Scotian. He was still moving slowly 
and turning as he fell. Reptilian in 
metabolism though he was, he need- 
ed air, and he was currently trying 
to get his ration through a severed 
throat. When the circuit blew he 
had been looking elsewhere for in- 
structions and had left Xenia’s use- 
ful knife sticking in the fleshy part of 
her shoulder. 

Pulling it free and putting it to 
instant use had been pure therapy 
to the silvery Fingalnan, and she was 
actually grinning like a pleased cat 
when she joined Fletcher. 

Her knife pricking into the skin 
over the Garamasian’s heart was a 
better argument than Fletcher’s neck 
: lock. It also allowed freedom of 
speech. She said, “Tell them to stay 
where they are or you will surely 
die.” 

“What do you hope to gain? If 
you kill me you will die yourselves. 
If you do not you will only delay 
your deaths for a little time. There 
is no escape for you.” 

Fletcher reached out for the strap 
of the pouch and swung it clear of 
the table. 

Movement toward them was very 
gradual, and Xenia sensed it as a 
mental thing before it was physically 
obvious. She said, “Tell them to 
stand still,” and shoved the blade a 
few millimeters towards its beating 
goal. 

Dag Fletcher was fumbling in the 
pouch bag and came out with one 
of the demolition charges. Then he 
hung the bag by its strap on the 
back of the leader’s chair.

speaking in the lingua franca he 
said, “I have set this now for im- 
pact detonation. I only have to 
drop it. Unless I can take it with 
me, we shall all go up.” 

Cold, black eye disks held his 
own for a long pause. Xenia said, 
“That’s all wight, Dag. But I’m sor- 
ry it had to end like this.” 

“Don’t be. Not many people have 
such an opportunity to go good.” 
“To that man that is sin?” 
“Something like that.” 

But under the surface of his mind, 
that structure which could present 
a thousand units of information in 
any living second, there was a ma- 
jority voice that was less than satis- 
faction and viewed the move into 
oblivion as an unqualified evil in it- 
self. Not least in this self-preserva- 
tion lobby was the fifth-column, 
flank-turner Eros. 

Without deviating pressure at the 
knife point she put a warm hand 
on his arm and said incomprehen- 
sibly to those who could follow the 
Earth language, “1 wegwet it too.” 

P iranha-face stirred uncomfortably. 

He spoke out in the lingua 
franca, “Let them go. They can not 
get far. The bomb might just as 
well go off outside.” 

Fletcher backed towards the exit 
making unmistakable mime that any 
attempt to rush him would cause 
his ten-centimeter cube to hit the 
deck. 

Xenia seemed to take her knife 
out of its pincushion with real re- 
luctance. At the door, Fletcher 
stopped and said, “Can we do any- 
thing for Hocker?” 



She said, “I’ll twy. But frankly 
he does nothing for me. You’d be 
better without that one.” 

There was one undamaged carafe 
on the conference table. She took 
it and poiued it over Hocker’s head. 
When he stirred, she said without 
any womanly sympathy, “On yoin 
feet, Lieutenant. This is no time 
for lying about. Quickly. Quickly 

He allowed himself to be led out 
like a dumb ox, shaking his head 
from side to side and seeing only a 
confused double-image view of the 
set. 

In the corridor they were watched 
out by a double row of silent guards. 
The word had gone ahead that the}' 
were to have free passage. 

As they 'began to go up the ramp. 
Hocker stumbled once against 
Fletcher’s shoulder, and a sigh of 
audience participation went up from 
the spectators. 

Fletcher steadied the box and cen- 
tered it afresh on his flat palm. 
Xenia said sharply, “Watch him, 
Dag. That was partly intentional. 
They tried a two-way feed on me. 
Maybe they planted some ideas on 
our fwiend.” 

Up in the courtyard, Fletcher 
quickened his pace. When they 
reached the line of waiting cars he 
was going at a jog trot and his sil- 
very A.D.C. running with a pennant 
of blonde hair flying back. 

He took the first car in line and 
spent a count of ten looking at its 
instrument console. Then he was 
moving it off its pad to the entrance. 

Hocker said, “What’s the hurry?” 

“We have aboout fifteen seconds 
to get out.”

“How come? What’s the trouble?” 
“The second demolition mine. I 
set it down there in the bag. Give 
or take a second.” 

They were at the beginning of the 
tunnel. Hooker slid open the hatch 
and was out, running back across 
the courtyard. 

He shouted, “I must warn them. 
The plan will fail.” 

Fletcher looked back. Three cars 
had sidled out of the line and were 
following up. There was no time 
to go back. Xenia was out. She 
steadied herself against the side of 
the machine, and her arm flicked like 
a whiplash. Hocker fell forward, face 
down on the tiles, with her knife 
sticking out of his back. 

Then she was inside again, and 
they were surging down the narrow 
way with the portcullis lifting to let 
them through. 

Outside he gave it the gun, and 
they circled behind the sabotaged 
pump house to check that PetreVs 
car had indeed gone. They saw an- 
other green shuttle storm out of the 
narrow cleft, then a circular puff of 
fragmented debris rose from the in- 
visible center of the building com- 
plex. A seismographical ripple tra- 
versed the purple field of erichthon- 
ius. The pump house took it like a 
dinghy hitting the wake of a hydro- 
foil and rocked to its foundations. 

Xenia said, “Look. Dag. We did 
it.” 

H e spared a second’s vision from 
a struggle to get full power out 
of the unfamiliar machine and saw 
that it was indeed so. The great walls 
were fissured from top to bottom 



and leaning in. Even as he looked, 
a widening rent began to spill out 
a ragbag of artifacts. The single fig- 
ure of a man appeared momentarily' 
like a scrabbling beetle on its crum- 
bling surface before a rising dust 
pall obscured the site. 

A line of holes punched through 
the fabric of their car just above 
head height. That brought him back 
to the business in hand. The Gara- 
masian car had used time to gain 
height, and was coming in from the 
port quarter in a murderous power 
dive. 

Dag said, “Lie down on the 
floor!” He flung them in a steeply 
banked turn which brought the car 
to the edge of its potential. The 
other pilot was committed to his 
dive, and they had a broadside view 
with a face in every lateral port 
looking up. 

The clatter of a machine pistol 
at his back brought Dag’s head 
round to the inside of his own steep- 
ly tilted car. Xenia had found it in 
a ceiling clip and was swiveling in 
a tail-end-Oharlie gunner’s seat. He 
thought, “She’s unbreakable. I’d 
rather have her at my back than 
any man I know.” 

Into his mind her voice said di- 
rectly, “Only at your back? That’s 
not very complimentary.” And he' 
knew that the heightened awareness 
of shared danger had put the tele- 
pathic link on a two-way net. 

But habit dies hard. He asked 
aloud, “That report. You still have 
it safe?” 

Falling in with ihis choice of medi- 
um, she said, “You do go on about 
that weport. I haven’t got it at all. 



34 



IF 




It’s in that little car of yours. I 
hope they don’t cwash it or any- 
thing.” Then she was raking the 
following car in bursts of fire that 
put molten metal asterisks along its 
bluff bows. 

“Any luck?” 

“No. Armor there in fwont. Only 
the woof vulnerable, I expect. Still, 
it will make them more careful,** 

Four lengths separated the hurry- 
ing cars. Already they were crossing 
out of the farm belt. Dag Fletcher 
put everything out of mind except 
the navigational chore, and Xenia 
could pick up only fragmentary clues 
of the high-speed calculations that 
were going on in his private compu- 
ter. 

Professional to the ends of her 
fingertips, she knew better than to 
interfere in a task which only he 
could perform. Except for an occa- 
sional transmission of a kind which 
she thought might be good for his 
morale, she kept out of his mind. 

Using a formidable visual mem- 
ory, he projected on to the unfamil- 
iar chart blank all the mathematical 
detail which had cluttered the pre- 
sentation table of the scout car. In 
ten minutes he had pin-pointed Pet- 
rel and set up a course line. 

Some of the gear was very good. 
Absorbed in the technology angles, 
he made notes of some features 
which could well be incorporated in 
the I.G.O. scout cars. As a final act 
of confidence, he brought in the au- 
topilot and after a full minute, with 
the car holding course at undimin- 
ished speed at its ceiling of eighty 
meters, he left the pilot’s seat to 
take a look at the view. 



As he went down the center aisle 
between the seats, he realized with 
a sudden feeling of guilt that he had 
not heard from her for some time. 
When he got there, he knew why. 

X enia had strapped herself in to 
the swivel chair and blood from 
the Scotian’s long, exploratory dig 
had welled out in bright slow rivu- 
lets. Head back, so that her silky, 
blonde hair hung straight away from 
her neat head. Throat round and 
firm. A small pulse beating in a 
taut hollow below her collar bone. 
Breasts a pale silvery tumescence 
against the harness. She was uncon- 
scious. 

He loosened the straps and laid 
her flat in the aisle. 

The pursuing craft was still there, 
a good ten lengths astern and five 
meters below. Assuming the cars 
were equal, he would have the edge, 
because Garamasian had a capacity 
crew. Ten at least. Best part of a 
thousand kilograms. He took a look 
at the console and found the auto 
pilot was holding the course without 
a microsecond’s deviation. 

Above each pair of seats he found 
a shallow locker recessed in the roof 
and methodically worked his way 
round the car. Medical kit, water 
tubes, ration packs. He spill^ them 
out on to the seats. No clothing. 
But it was warm enough and would 
be warmer before they reached the 
ship. Fingalnans anyway were not 
clothes conscious and only wore 
them for decorative possibilites. 

With a pad of lint and some luke- 
warm water he bathed away congeal- 
ed blood and drew the delicate sil-

very skin together with continuous 
strips of skin-graft strapping. He 
broke out enough lint pads to cush- 
ion her against the ridged floor and 
as a refinement, on purely esthetic 
grounds, spread her hair in asym- 
metrical fan like a pale aureole. 

She was as well out of it for a 
time. Transfusion of plasma could 
be carried out in Petrel* s minute sick 
bay. That would be a treat for Sholto 
Quinn, the ship’s medicine man. 

The car hurried on. Now he was 
checking for seconds of leeway in 
the schedule. Cotgrave would give 
him every chance, wait to the last 
minute before taking Petrel up; but 
he was bound by his orders and no 
return could reasonably be expected. 
They were over the desert, and heat 
was notching up. It was providential 
that he had moved the ship to the 
coast; a short journey from the car 
might just be tolerable at the coast 
site. At the viaduct even seconds 
without a life-support system would 
have been too long. 

Then another thought struck him. 
Cotgrave would see the approach of 
two Garamasian craft as a threat. 
A ship was very vulnerable at the 
instant of liftoff. Even small-arm 
fire could upset her delicate balance. 
The co-pilot would be inclined to 
blast them as soon as they were in 
range of the main armament. 

W hen Petrel showed up, a slend- 
er spire on the horizon, they 
had a two-minute lead on the follow- 
ing car. Above the maroon pennant, 
Dag Fletcher had broken out an im- 
provised wihite rectangle. He slip- 
ped control out of the autopilot’s 



capable hand and began to circle the 
ship, noticing the wreathing steam 
spiraling from heating rocket tubes 
and willing Bennett to wait one 
minute more. 

Then he was going down in a 
steep dive and ploughing into soft 
sand twenty meters from the tripod 
legs. 

Even in the hurrying car, making 
its own ventilating draft, and refrig- 
eration doing its best, it was hot. 
Sweat was glistening on his bare 
arms and running unchecked down 
his face. He saw the freight hatch 
open and a small elevator platform 
begin its descent with a bulky figure 
in full gear which could be Engels. 

Cotgrave, with his finger on the 
button to blast the car, saw its hatch 
slide back and Fletcher’s tall figure 
step out onto the burning sand. 
Across his arms, like a drugged vic- 
tim being delivered for a burnt of- 
fering to Baal, was the limp, silvery 
figure of a Fingalnan girl. Bennett 
from the navigation console said, 
“That’s the agent, believe it or not. 
It looks as though she’s bought it.” 

Dag Fletcher forced himself on. 
Behind him he heard the disintegrat- 
ing roar of the Garamasian car, 
caught by Farnley as a plumb target 
on the hairlines of his main laser. 
But he was walking through fire 
and heard it as an irrelevance from 
another world. It was the furnace 
mouth. Heat that was shriveling his 
skin. Boiling his blood. 

Then hands were holding him up, 
and the elevator was retracting. 
Slowly, slowly. Too slowly. He was 
fighting for breath. 

It seemed only seconds later that 



36 



IF 




he was Stirring in his own accelera- 
tion couch in his cabin and calling 
the command island. “Commander 
to One. Course detail.” 

Cotgrave said, “Glad to have you 
back on the net, Commander.” 

A miniature of the main scanner 
glowed above Fletcher’s head, and he 
saw Garamas as a plate-sized disk 
with the land masses in clear defini- 
tion. 

Cotgrave said, “Sixteen hours to 
R.V. Permission to stand down.” 
“Check. Carry on.” 

VIII 

S ixteen hours. Xenia would have 
to transfer to Euro pa. Facilities 
there for an extra body. And a very 
popular body she would be. 

When he went into the sick bay, 
Quinn said,“ She’s doing very well. 
I’d say she was just about indestruc- 
tible. Anyway I’ll leave you to talk 
to her; she tells me there is classified 
material to discuss. But don’t excite 
her, now.” 

When he had backed out of the 
tiny crucible, Xenia sat up in her 
narrow cot. In the familiar surround- 
ings of his ship, her silvery nudity 
was a greater surprise. Too late he 
remembered that his thoughts were 
not his own. 

She said, “So you think the warn- 
ing about excitement ought to have 
been given to me? That’s nice. Six- 
teen hours. That isn’t long. I have 
to give you a big thank you.” 
Nobody in that cubicle could be 
far away from any other occupant, 
and it was easy for her to reach out 
and put her arms round his neck. 



“How do you feel?” He was do- 
ing his best to keep a conversation 
going. 

“I feel fine. You feel fine, too. 
I do like you, Dag. Will you come 
and see me when you have a fur- 
lough?” 

“Where will you be?” 

“I have to do a session at I.G.O. 
headqaurters. It will be a long time 
before I go out on another mission. 
Prepawation takes a long time.” 

“Certainly I’ll come and see you. 
I owe you a lot, Xenia, and so does 
the service. That was your show and 
you did well.” 

“You sound like a schoolmaster 
pwaising a pupil.” 

Before he could reply, her lips, 
very warm and soft, had effectively 
closed his. But the mental link be- 
gan to open, and he found that he 
could follow her argument in a com- 
munication that used no words, but 
made sense at one remove from con- 
ventional, overt symbols. 

It went something like, this is a 
military unit. You are putting me in 
an impossible position. 

There is no such thing as an im- 
possible position. Just a greater chal- 
lenge to ingenuity. 

Quinn said you were not to be ex- 
cited. 

I know better than any Earthman 
about whether I want to be excited 
or not. 

Don’t wriggle about, you’ll start 
bleeding again. 

Lock the door. 

No. 

Then I’ll get up and do it. 

He opened the door and looked 
out. Quinn coming back along the

corridor. Fletcher said, “She’s okay, 
Doc. ni sit with her until she goes 
to sleep.” 

Then he went inside and thought-.^ 
fully dropped the toggle on the 
catch. 

T he squadron was moving like a 
silver chain on a velvet display 
pad, in line astern, with Europa in 
the center of her corvette screen. 
Petrel came up on the microsecond. 
“Permission to rejoin.” 

“Permission granted. Admiral re- 
quests Commander Fletcher and I.G. 
O. agent to proceed aboard flag- 
ship.” 

The beginning of the end. Swing 
out over vacant interstellar space 
with Xenia beside him on the line, 
already an anonymous figure. Re- 
port delivered in the command cab- 
in. Xenia indifferent of the impact 
she made, coldly professional again. 
Even the smallest coveralls found on 
Petrel were sloppy on that small 
figure. 

Valley said, “Success must carry 
a certain commendation. But I am 
bound to tell you. Commander, that 
your actions could have had serious 
repercussions. I must ask you in 
the future to stay within your brief.” 
He fingered the small gray capsule 
which contained Xenia’s report. “We 
have succeeded in our mission, and 
there is a bonus in the destruction 
of the fascist nerve center. Govern- 
ment forces have re-established con- 
trol, and it is given out that the de- 
struction of the power ring was part 
of the takeover plan. I shall men- 
tion your part in it in my dispatch. 
We are bound now for I.G.O. H.Q. 



A short leave for all personnel, I 
understand, before the next mis- 
sion.” 

Swinging back over the black 
depths to his ship, Dag Fletcher rec- 
ognized her mind penetrating the 
vacuum to speak to him. Tenuous 
at this distance it was no more than 
a warm promise, a feeling of well- 
being, a frail human alliance at this 
instant of time in the immensity of 
galactic space. Time indeed was still 
on their side with another meeting, 
and that, when rightly considered, 
was as far as any reasonable man 
would wish to. go into the future. 

He sent back as a signal, the sig- 
nal, the single, ubiquitous service 
word for acceptance of any situation. 

“Check.” END

DISTANT EARTH 



by BASIL WELLS 

Naron might not be 
such a bad planet — if 
•.only it weren't invisible! 



iC A planet without vegetation, 
surface water, or life. A 
leaky spacelighter without fuel. 
Food for six months and half that 
much oxygen.” 

Mai Harker shook his head hope- 
lessly. 

If that doesn’t spell murder, Es- 
me,” he went on tonelessly, “name 
what it is.” 

The yellowish dusty wastes of 
Naron, fourth planet of Kyor 
Twelve, were coming up swiftly to 
meet them. The outer shell of the 
clumsy (little craft was warming 
rapidly, so steep was their course; 
but they had no spare retro fuel for 
a second approach. 

Esme Jannot’s pleasant round face 
was placid. In all their four years to- 
gether aboard the planet-mapping 
Von Ark, he had never seen her up- 
set or excited. His partner, Ilda 
Nolan, had nicknamed her “Doll.” 
She was blonde, blue-eyed and tall. 

It angered Harker that she seemed 
so little concerned. 



The small spacelighter was being 
tossed about now by the outer shreds 
of atmosphere despite the measure of 
stabilization afforded by the rudi- 
mentary wings. 

“There is atmosphere, Mai,” said 
Esme. “Somewhere there may be a 
rift or oasis that will support life. We 
have three, perhaps six, months to 
find it. Remember, we did not map 
aU Naron.” 

“And in the meantime Dorn Tate 
will be light-years distant — with 
my partner!” 

Harker beat his fist against the 
cramped cabin’s insulated green mat- 
ting of resilient synthetics. 

“That is the heart of the matter,” 
said (the big woman strapped into 
the control seat at his side. “Tate 
has stolen your parner. It is not the 
loss of the Von Ark or being exiled 
here that troubles you most. It is 
the ithou^t of Ilda alone with Tate.” 

“Yes,” Harker agreed savagely. 

“You knew that he too loved 
Ilda,” she said calmly. “You could 



40 




have avoided this ugly crisis by free- 
ing her at the last six-months’ part- 
nering.” 

“We neither of us wanted that.” 
He scowled over at Esme Jannot. 
“The thought of her partnering with 
Tate was revolting to us both.” 

“And to me as well, Mai. Yet I 
was his partner for these four years 
past. It was for the good of the 
ship and its personnel. Men and 
women need companionship and un- 
derstanding. We understood that 
when we signed for the voyage.” 

“I realize that. What I, what we 
both feel, is not anything logical. It 
is something atavistic I suppose. We 
love one another.” He struggled for 
words. “We belong.” 

The ship, under semi-automatic 
controls, leveled off, cooling its su- 
perheated skin. They saw the dead 
yellow surface now from a height of 
less than a score of miles. And there 
were no gaping wide canyons or 
sunken depressions visible where they 
might eke out a miserable existence 
for a time. Only jutting ridges of 
barren black rock, some of them 
thousands of feet in height, marred 
the waterless wastelands below. Es- 
me Jannot’s voice cut across a long 
silence. 

“And because of your selfishness, 
and Ilda’s as well, we were drugged 
and put adrift near this dead 
world.” 

She smiled. “I am not condemning 
you, Mai. I only wish someone, 
sometime, had loved me in the same 
way.” 

Harker glanced quickly over at 
the big woman’s face. He had caught 
a trace of wistfulness, perhaps of re- 



gret, in her voice. And then he re- 
alized that they must ground on 
the surface witMn a scant handful 
of minutes. 

“What do you say?” he asked. 
“Should we land on one of the mesas 
or near its base?” 

“Water goes down, Mai. I vote 
for the lowest area possible.” 
“Agreed,” cried Harker. 

T heir final goal was a huge mass 
of stone, perhaps a hundred 
miles across and roughly star shaped 
— a seven-pointed star. The dark 
bulk was flattened on top, and a 
mile-wide rift cut it into a larger 
and a smaller segment. Here, Hark- 
er reasoned, there might be possible 
openings into a subterranean cavern 
or caverns. 

The tiny spaceligbter came down 
across an upeurving bed of pale 
sand, heading toward the split moun- 
tain that would be their final resting 
place. The sand’s friction would slow 
them, he hoped, but not too much. 

The ship met resistance, a hun- 
dred feet or so labove the sea of sand. 
There was a hissing burbling rush 
of sound. He felt the ship slowing. 
And now the sand was closer under 
them. Fifty feet and then twenty. 
They felt the sand bite into the hull. 
The lighter shuddered. 

Sand sprayed outward and up- 
ward, obscuring their vision momen- 
tarily. Yet there was no sound trans- 
mitted through the ship’s tough 
outer skin. It was like plowing 
through a dense fog. 

Came a rending crash. They were 
thrown forward in their resilient 
harnesses. Harker regretted not hav-

ing Esme don the lone spacesuit, a 
battered, much-patched outfit. If the 
lighter was holed they might die al- 
most at once. 

And the ship was broken. The 
alien atmosphere was seeping into 
the cabin, diluting the stale stench 
of the air trapped there. 

“It’s good!” cried Esme in a 
strangled voice. “Smells fresh and 
ciean! Green growing things! Fresh 
earth!” 

Harker released his pent-up breath. 
Deadly gases might be masked by a 
pleasant smell, he knew, but he had 
to breathe. And he took a second 
deep breath, savoring to the full a de- 
ceptive sweet fragrance. 

In a moment they might both be 
dead or dying, but for the moment 
he relaxed and was thankful for their 
safe grounding. He forgot Dora 
Tate, the arrogant graying astrogator, 
and his tiny, darkly beautiful part- 
ner, Ilda Nolan, a captive aboard 
the spacer. 

The sound of Esme Jannot’s unzip- 
ping and unpopping (the contrd 
chair’s harnesses aroused him from 
this pleasant lethargy. He set about 
freeing himself. 

Golden light from the sandy 
waste outside poured through the 
broken transparency of the nose blist- 
er. He went to the sealed entrance 
port and spun the safety lock’s hand- 
wheel. 

The round laminated thickness of 
the first lock, and of the second, this 
a trifle warped and sticking, slid into 
their grooves; and the way outside 
was open. 

“It feels,” said Esme, as they 
gained the outside, “hke Mother 



Earth after a summer rainstormi Yet 
this is desert. Dead!” 

Underfoot the sand felt springy 
and almost sticky. Harker looked 
down, puzzled, and then looked over 
at the woman’s comfortable dark 
shoes. Like his own their soles rode 
an inch or better above the gritty- 
looking soil. 

Something invisible and compressi- 
ble covered the dead land here at 
the base of the star-splattered loom 
of the mountain! Something like 
this had caught at them as they were 
coming in for a landing! 

And the air was rich and heady 
with the scent of moisture and grow- 
ing things! He heard the breeze whis- 
pering! 

Harker bent over, his hands prob- 
ing into the nothingness beneath. He 
felt the crispness of grasslike growth 
— the coolness of recently watered 
roots and stems. A hoarse bird sang. 

“There is vegetation here, Esme!” 
he cried out. “Why we cannot see it 
I do not know.” 

E sme was lying on her stomach 
when he turned, her face buried 
in the invisible sod and her fingers 
digging into the seeming emptiness. 
She sat up, an unwonted excite- 
ment in her deep blue eyes, her 
cheeks flushed. Harker saw her, as 
though for the first time, as a vital 
attractive woman. Why had he 
thought her dull and bovine aboard 
ship, he wondered? That other Esme 
Jannot, placid and uncomplaining, 
bad been a mummer’s masking. 

“There must be water, animals, 
edible plants,” she said, her eyes 
glowing. “After a time we may be 

ib;

able to see them — to live off the 
country.” 

“I don’t know, Esmc.” He frown- 
ed. “Plant life that cannot be seen. 
It must be too alien in structure for 
our bodies to assimilate. It may not 
even be carbon-based.” 

His tongue was clumsy he knew. 
Words and thoughts tangled together 
and spilled out. He knew that it was 
the delayed shock of losing his part- 
ner, being exiled forever here on 
Naron and now the discovery of pos- 
sible reprieve from eventual starva- 
tion and thirst that made it so. 

“But we have a fighting chance 
now, Esme!” he cried out. “That 
must have been water, or something 
akin to it, that the lighter plowed 
through. Let’s analyze some of it.” 

The big woman smiled agreement. 
Side by side, their light rocket rifles 
outthmst like a blind man’s probing 
cane, they went down the easy slope 
below the ship. Twice Harker tripped 
over an unseen jut of brushy growth, 
once with a painful raking and pierc- 
ing from the thorns or needles of 
the Naronese plant. The roar of 
pounding surf strengthened. 

Before them the ydlow sand 
darkened and seeincd firmer in tex- 
ture. They were walking on a hard- 
packed beach of grassless sand. And 
they saw sand that moved. Now it 
came uphill, and now it slipped back- 
ward. Into this moving sand Harker 
stepped and felt fluid come swirling 
up about his ankles. He scooped up 
a palmful of the receding wave and 
tasted it. Definitely saline. He spat 
it cut. 

A larger wave staggered him, and 
he started to fall. He caught himself. 



after a bit of ungraceful arm waving 
and hopping, and rejoined the 
woman. 

“We’re in business — I think,” he 
said. “It feels like sea water. Once 
we have tested it and distilled a few 
gallons, we will know better.” 

W as it only four days? Four days 
on Naron meant a few minutes 
over eighty hours — the day being 
approximately twenty hours long — 
but it seemed much less. 

They had repaired the gaping 
wounds of the spacelighter as best 
they could and found a second day- 
time refuge from Naron’s great 
golden primary in a cliff-sheltered 
valley. Here they had found a small 
stream and a pool of fresh water, 
with several stands of straight-boled 
timber along the creek. It was here, 
on the three or four hundred acres 
of arable land, that they decided to 
settle to await an improbable rescue. 

With improvised hooks and lines, 
baited with bits of promine steaks or 
colored lures, they had fished the 
pool — hooking three and four 
pounders. Unhooking an invisible 
fish has its problems they had learn- 
ed; but later on, the fried beauties 
taldng on a misty reality with their 
coatings of synthameal and cooking 
oils, they had earned a tasty reward. 

Esme’s specialty, photography, had 
proved invaluable. The dozens of 
pictures, taken at random, revealed 
a fertile land of forests, meadows and 
a horizonless sea to the east. They 
had discovered slender deerlike ani- 
mals and fat, gray-haired brutes, hog- 
sized, that fed on roots and nuts 
under the smooth-boled trees. 



FROM DISTANT EARTH

Even yet, familiar as he was with 
the half-mile trail from the ship, 
Harker was continually running into 
low boughs or crashing into the 
trunks of trees along the way. And 
it was disconcerting to step on a 
writhing, snakelike something and 
leap backward. Yet your eyes re- 
vealed only a sere yellow wasteland. 

He tried to put Dda from his mind. 
When he imagined her alone with 
Dorn Tate, his anger and despair 
sickened him. Yet he knew there 
was nothing he could do. They were 
millions of miles distant by now. 
And they would never return. He 
and Tate’s discarded partner must 
end their lonely days here on this 
mysteriously veiled planet of Naron. 

Esme was an understanding wom- 
an. She respected his grief and 
could keep her silence. She left him 
to his own brooding thoughts and 
did not interfere in any way while 
he was steeped in bitter self pity. He 
realized what a pouting child he must 
appear and forced himself to labor 
harder. 

A cabin had to be built and a 
stockade across the narrow 
mouth of the valley to keep out the 
hidden animals of the ghostly forests. 
Experiment showed that wet mud 
from the pool, smeared on trees or 
leaves, remained to mark their 
presence. He experimented with 
sprays, outlining their immediate sur- 
roundings. He used dyes to stain 
the water, the resultant contents of 
the valley pool having an unreal 
cottony appearance. And he set out 
generous cuttings of the edible, 
oxygen-freeing hybrids that the 



space! ighter’s air-reclamation system, 
utilized. They grew luxuriantly, 
Harker was busy and, increasing- 
ly, almost happy. He knew that the 
buxom woman who shared his exile 
often felt the same. He caught her 
singing softly as she worked, not 
once, but a dozen times. The sun 
was coloring their skin, and its 
warmth caused them to shed the 
superfluous burdens of emergency 
coveralls, standard aboard ^ip, and 
don shorts and brief tunics. 

He discovered that Esme was a 
big woman, yes, but beautifully pro- 
portioned and strong. Ihere was 
nothing flabby or needlessly sagging 
about her body. To most men, he 
thought, she would be very attractive. 
But not to Mai Harker. He loved 
Ilda Nolan — and he always would 
be faithful to her. 

H e was spraying the trees about 
the little clearing where they 
had decided to build. The spray was 
a fine mist of aluminum paint and 
carbon scraped from the tubes. It 
outlined, in a darkly silver sort of 
shadow-image, the immediate sur- 
roundings. Silvery sward underfoot 
and silvery trunks and leaves arch- 
ing overhead. His supply of the paint 
was strictly limited; only the heart 
of his projected farm could be 
marked. But there were substitutes. 

“Mai!” screamed Esme from the 
direction of the pool. 

He could not see her, the rocky 
lip of the pool’s edge was nine or ten 
feet above it, but he knew she had 
gone there for a bath and, perhaps, 
to hook a fish later. 

He ran, the improvised hand 

IF 



44 




Bprayer yet in his grip. Now he saw 
her clothing, abandoned at the pool’s 
invisible edge, and then, across the 
hundred-foot bowl, he saw her 
struggling, her kicking body being 
impelled up the rocky slope. She was 
fighting an unseen something, or 
things, as savagely as her great 
strength allowed. 

Harker’s needle-spitting hand gun 
was at his hip, its needles armed 
with paralyn. If he fired Esme might 
well absorb several of the paralyzing 
slivers. More than five or six meant 
death. And the metabolism of the 
unseen raiders might remain unaf- 
fected by the drug. 

He ran swiftly after Esme, cir- 
cling the pool and tripping over 
hidden undergrowth as he did so. 
As he neared her contorted body, 
something that sounded heavy and 
vicious went hurtling past his ear. He 
ducked, stumbled and was aware of 
the tank of compressed air and the 
nozzle and paint cylinder that bump- 
ed ground before he recovered. 

He depressed the stud, showering 
Esme’s naked body and 'the invisible 
enemy equally with an aluminum 
mist. The spray caught three hulking 
shapes, humanoid in general shape 
but larger, thicker and wider. One 
of the trio held Esme’s arms locked 
behind her, but the other two were 
advancing on Harker. Both imper- 
fect shells of animated silver swung 
huge clubs, and a savage roar of 
anger and savagery went up. 

A lashing club grazed his shoulder. 
He had the needier out by that time 
and was sewing metallic slivers across 
their middles. The other club struck 
the ground, so quickly had the 



paralyn acted, and the two kidnap- 
pers were helpless. Harker rubbed at 
his left shoulder’s numbness, feeling 
the sting of bruised flesh, and 
sidled around Esme and her captor 
seeking a clear shot. 

The bulky biped hurled Esme 
aside, bellowing, and rushed Harker. 
An unseen fist slapped the needier, 
even as it started to spew out its 
deadly hail, from Harker’s grip. He 
felt a huge, strangely hard body 
slam into his own; 'and he went 
down. A snarling mouth came down 
at his throat. He jabbed an elbov/ 
into emptiness, and the barely dis- 
cernable head fell away momentarily. 

He pumped his fists, he had 
dropped the sprayer even before the 
hand gun, into the springy armor- 
like body of the aborigine. He heard 
Esme panting out words of courage. 
Then the needier hummed, close at 
hand, and his Naronese assailant col- 
lapsed upon him. 

“Mall” she was crying as she roll- 
ed the helpless creature out of the 
way. “Mai, are you hurt?” 

H arker grunted, raising himself to 
a sitting poslurel He moved his 
neck and arms — stretched. His 
shoulder felt numb, and be was gasp- 
ing for breath; but he was unbanned. 
He saw surprised tears in Esme’s 
eyes — although after her close es- 
cape that mi^t be expected. 

“Yeah ” he managed “I’m fine.” 
She was examining his bruised 
shoulder, forgetful of her own undod 
state. He could see that it was an 
ugjy bndse, wiith blood oozing 
through <the abrasions, but his arm 
was not too badly affected. 



FROM DISTANT EARTH 



45 




“Thanks be,” Esme said. “I was 
so afraid that you would be killed. 
And I couldn’t face that.” She 
shivered. “This horrible place — 
these unseen monsters — the desert!” 

She was sobbing her arms 
around his neck, her tears wet on 
his bared shoulder. Gone was the 
calm, almost robotic, crew member 
he had known for several years 
aboard the Von Ark, This was a 
warm-blooded, sympathetic queen of 
a woman. Her tanned fair flesh was 
warm and soft against him . 

Harker pushed at her gently. He 
stood up. 

“We had best get back to the 
lighter,” he said. “No telling how 
many more of these brutes are prowl- 
ing about.” 

Esme shook her ithick chestnut 
curls into order with a toss of her 
head. With the back of her hand 
she brushed the surplus tears away. 
She was smiling again, suddenly, her 
usual calm capable self — and this 
despite her recent outburst. Harker 
was proud of her. 

While Esme went for her garments 
around the pond’s rim Harker spray- 
ed one of die helpless creatures more 
completely. Its color was of course 
not apparent, but it appeared to be 
four-to^, rather than five-toed, and 
its hands boasted an equal number 
of digits. 

The apishly thick-bodied brute 
was close to seven feet tall and com- 
pletely hairless. The legs were short, 
thick and bowed. The huge-jawed 
skull, capped by six flexible crestings 
of fin-like ridges, was equipped with 
the huge, flat-slabbed teeth of an 
herbivore. 

46 



Harker understood now the ap- 
parent hardness of the native’s body! 
The external body covering was a 
natural and flexible coating of bony 
plates almost chitinous in character. 
This strange carapace of linked 
plates gave way to more normal 
flesh on arms and legs, but even this 
was coarse and scaly. 

“Ready,” called Esme. “Let’s go 
to the ship.” 

“One minute,” Harker cried, 
gathering up the sprayer and one of 
the crude, hide-wrapped splinters of 
igneous rock that the natives car- 
ried for weapons. 

“We must come back with a 
camera,” he said as he reached her 
side, “before they recover . .” 

T he lowest level of the city was a 
hundred yards above the plain. 
The city was the product of centuries 
of boring into a drum-shaped mesa’s 
softer rock layers. Now the city’s 
avenues and passages honeycombed 
the mesa’s several miles of diameter. 

Four elderly Naronese, in an ex- 
terior chamber on the thirtieth and 
topmost level, linked minds amicably. 

“Unless we free their eyes,” one 
declared, “both aliens will be destroy- 
ed by the Lynks or the tagants. And 
a new defence against aliens should 
be devised. They see through pic- 
tures.” 

“We must not let the offlings 
die,” agreed a second, “but the 
mother ship did go away, suspecting 
nothing. These two were left behind 
to die. So I say let us release these 
two from their visual blackout but 
retain the planet-wide shielding.” 

“I agree with Hedl,” the third 

IF 




native’s more deliberate thoughts 
came through. Retain the desert plan- 
et mirage, but free the two cast- 
aways.” 

“They are much too interesting 
specimens to permit their wanton 
destruction,” the last of the quartet 
agreed. “I too vote with Hedl. Yet 
I also agreed with Adro that a sec- 
ond line of defense against possible 
future invasions be considered. The 
next aliens may not be as primitive 
and peaceful as these Earthmen. Nor 
as amenable to mental suggestion.” 

“Even with these aliens our only 
complete success has been with their 
vision.” The thoughts were flooding 
together now. “Natural blocks 
against control like the brutish Lynks 
of the forests . Yet we can read 
their thoughts . Not control 
them . Children in many respects 
and cruel as only the young . • . 
They can be taught wisdom, Hedl 
. And they can teach us as 
well . .” 

Thoughts battered, splashed and 
churned. Eventually an agreement 
was reached, and the word went out 
to the scattered millions of ' Naro- 
nese spread thinly across the globe. 
The male and the female alien were 
to be permitted full vision at once. 

That a few isolated citizens mis- 
understood or were asleep or mental- 
ly disturbed was to be expected. To 
them can be ascribed the vague sense 
of unreality felt by Esme and Mark- 
er at first . 

T hey were entering the lighter’s 
outer lock when the curtain 
was abruptly lifted. 

The sward underfoot was a blend- 



ing of purple and green, the tightly 
curled underleaves a paler hue. The 
trees of the forest were paler, on 
the whole, than Terrestrial vegeta- 
tion; but then the pale golden tinge 
of the heavens, opposed to the blue 
of Earth, made for strange lighting 
effects. They saw for the first time 
— excluding the color films Esme 
had taken, the grazing herds on the 
plain to the sea’s red-sanded brink. 
“What happened?” cried Esme. 
“Like scales dropping from our 
eyes,” mused Marker. “Some ancient 
writer wrote that. And it is so.” 
Unconsciously diey had come to- 
gether, arms interlocked and bodies 
touching. It was a need for mutual 
reassurance — a fear of the unknown 
that needed to be faced jointly. 

“See those creatures, like tigers 
or lions, prowling along the ridge,” 
Esme cried. “Covered with blue fur, 
or hair, large as a horse! And the 
ruminants. Like bison but bigger . .” 
“The cat beasts are called tagants. 
The ruminants are satas. And the 
brutish bipeds you defeated so clever- 
ly are called Lynks, They are de- 
graded offshoots of our own race,” 
There was no voice. Marker was 
sure of that. He turned about, peer- 
ing. Esme was not smiling nov/, her 
face pale. There was a sound of 
footsteps on the grassy cushion at 
the spacelighter’^ stam; and two gi- 
ants, scarlet-plated with shading to 
a delicate yellow and white along the 
belly and chest, strode into view. 

“Forget your weapons, Mai Mark- 
er and Esme Jannot,” the bodiless 
voice cautioned. “We could have 
destroyed you long ago had we de- 
sired.” 



FROM DISTANT EARTH 



47 




Harker nodded somewhat ruefully. 

“I expect you could,” he agreed, 
his eyes taking in the finely fitted 
harness of leather and metal and the 
sword and the dagger hanging from 
it. 

“We do not kill needlessly, Mai 
Harker,” the alien thoughts came. 
“Only the Lynks and a species of 
sea serpent resist our control. The 
weapons are for them and for mis- 
guided men of our own race.” 

“And what of us?” Harker de- 
manded. “Are we your prisoners? 
Now that we can see you, what is 
to happen to us?” 

“You are offered this valley and 
the others surrounding. You can 
never return to Earth. You have 
been deserted by your leader. Here 
you 'and your children can dwell in 
comfort.” 

Harker swore half-heartedly and 
spluttered. Esme reddened. 

“We are not partners or mates,” 
he said. “My partner was stolen. I 
am faithful to her. There will be no 
children.” 

The thoughts of the Naronese 
were amused. 

“Wait -and see,” they advised. And 
then: “we will come again tomor- 
row.” 

They turned and walked swiftly 
back the way they had come. Harker 
and Esme looked at one another 
uncertainly. A small doubt was gnaw- 
ing at Barker’s brain. The two 
Naronese apparently knew something 
that he did not suspect. He recalled 
how Esme had flushed and looked 
away. 

Forget it, he told himself, and 
get to work on the stockade and the 



cabin and at the planting. Now that 
you can see your surroundings your 
sprayer is not needed. WorkI 

But there was something whole- 
some and fine about Esme . 

T hat night he was battling with 
Dorn Tate. It was a hopeless 
battle from the first. Tate was older 
stronger and more experienced. And 
watching, laughing mockingly at his 
feeble efforts, was his eight-term 
partner, lovely, dark Ilda Nolan. 
In utter despair he cried out and 
heaved the crushing bulk of Dorn 
Tate from him — and awoke! 

The hopelessness of that nightmare 
battle carried over into his waking 
thoughts. Helpless here on Naron, 
while his beloved Ilda was born light- 
years away. What good to live on? 
There was no hope of rescue. The 
first colonizing expeditions to follow 
the route they were blazing would 
come a century or so later, and this 
desert -planet would be avoided. He 
groaned aloud. 

“Is something wrong?” Esme ask- 
ed softly. 

“Everything, Esme,” he said. In 
the pale light of Naron’s larger moon 
he saw her across the control cabin, 
sitting up in her emergency shock 
hammock. “Why go on living?” 
Esme swung -herself out of the 
hammock and came over to his im- 
provised cot of cushions and web- 
bing. She was angry, he saw as she 
switched on the ship’s side lights. 
He had never seen her like this be- 
fore. Her hair all tousled and her 
face . 

“For four years,” she said sharp- 
ly, “you kept one partner aboard 

IP 



48 




ship. You were faithful to her as our 
code of ethics requires you to be.” 
“You know that, Esme. You were 
the only other woman aboard the 
Von Ark/* 

“Had Ilda partnered with Dorn 
Tate you would have respected that 
relationship?” she demanded. 

“Why, of course, Esme,” Marker 
agreed, “but Ilda would never have 
partnered with him. We were — 
are in love.” 

“I would never had spoken of 
this, Mai, had we returned safely 
to Earth. Believe me. But now I 
cannot let you go on destroying 
yourself ... I love you too much 
to let you . .” 

“You — me?” 

“Since we first boarded ship, Mai. 
But I knew how hopeless it was. 
Ilda wanted you, as well as Tate.” 
“What?” Marker’s hands clamp- 
ed Esme’s firm shoulders. “You say 
she wanted — Tate?” 

“And had him. They were lovers 
from take-off, Mai. You never sus- 
pected. You trusted them. And I 
knew the ship’s mission came first. 
What good to hurt you?” 

“You lie, Esme!” He shook her 
savagely. “This is a story you manu- 
factured. You lie!” 

His fist knotted. He drew it back 
and struck at Esme’s face. But his 
blow went wild, somehow, missing 
her completely. Instantly he was 
ashamed and shocked at. his instinc- 
tive brutality. 

“You invented it?” He was plead- 
ing. 

“It is true, Mai. Think. You must 



realize I am not lying. Ilda knew 
that you would obey the code if she 
were partnered with Tate. But he 
was not that honorable. 

“Until he changed and demanded 
that she leave you. It was after that 
that we w^ere set adrift near Naxon. 
She had lost her control over him.” 
“I will not believe.” 

“You must.” It was a powerful in- 
ner voice. “She tells the truth. We, 
of Naron, know the truth. Believe!” 
And Marker believed. There was 
utter conviction in the thoughts that 
had come through so strongly. A 
thousand memories came briefly to 
him confirming the ugly truth of 
his partner’s calculated unfaithful- 
ness. 

Dimly he sensed the withdrawal 
of the mental linkage with the Naro- 
nese. His mind was a dull ache 
within his skull, a bruised numbness 
slowly wearing through pain to a 
measure of peace. 

Esime was beside him, her arms 
tender about him, her voice soft. 
Gone was his anger at her. He felt 
shame and bitterness. His love for 
Ilda, her professions of love — all 
mirages, even as the desert world 
of Naron had been false. The reality 
was better. 

The operation had been clean 
and complete. Instead of a sickly 
dream he possessed something real 
and lasting at last. 

He took his partner in his arms, 
the moonlight of that alien world 
bright upon them, and it seemed 
that this was a homecoming to their 
own bit of a distant Earth . END

mote areas to collect. Demand ex- 
ceeding supply. Still no new seedlings. 
No success in transplanting. No suc- 
cess in locating seeds. Help. Usher.” 
“There’s our problem,” Conners 
said when Skroot looked up from 
the message. “The planet Gloomer 



has only one valuable resource, name- 
ly, Tastybushes. We have over a hun- 
dred collectors out there now, and 
we should probably send another 
fifty to keep up with the demand. 
But, you re^ it for yourself. We’re 
running out of Tastybushes. 



51 



R. V. Humphrey, author of this 
month's "first" story, is a field ar- 
chaeologist, photographer and lab 
technician at the University of Cali- 
fornia, where he is studying for his 
doctorate in Archeology. When not 
digging in prehistoric coastal Indian 
sites, our author enjoys shark fishing. 



“What’s even worse! Tastybush- 
blossom extract has become our big- 
gest product, and if the things dis- 
appear we’ll probably go bankrupt. 
Three or four more years like this, 
and we’ve had it.” Tiny tears rolled 
down Conners’ cheeks as he gravely 
considered bankruptcy. “That’s why 
we called you, Skroot. Find out why 
they’re dying off and fix it. If you 
can save them, you can almost name 
your own price.” 

Skroot read the message over again 
and queried, “Just what is this 
Tastybush-blossom extract used for?” 

“About ten years ago we began 
marketing it as a soft drink flavor. 
We never dreamed it would become 
so popular — or so profitable. Our 
sales doubled every year, and up to 
now we’ve expected to make some 
real money on it. We’re the only 
suppliers, you know. But last year we 
discovered that no young Tastybushes 
were sprouting in any of our collect- 
ing areas. The old bushes died off, 
and there weren’t any new ones to 
take their place. Now we have to go 
out into the swamps to find them, 
and that gets expensive, believe me. 

Skroot took his dog-eared notebook 
from its holster and began taking 
notes. 

“You know,” Conners continued. 



“This is the first new flavor in several 
hundred years. Before they finished 
exploring Earth, every time they dis- 
covered a new continent or some- 
thing a new flavor came with it. 
Like chocolate, when they discovered 
America. Since then, nothing until 
the Tastybushes. This is the only 
really new one that hasn’t turned out 
to be either poisonous or habit form- 
ing.” Conners grinned and chortled, 
“And we’re the only suppliers.” 
Skroot nodded his head in agree- 
ment. 

“Everybody loves it,” Conners an- 
nounced. “Some people drink six or 
seven bottles a day. And every bottle 
is worth a profit of three and a half 
cents.” He leaned back into his chair 
with evident satisfaction, but his 
smile turned into a scowl as the 
thought of bankruptcy returned. 
“But, as goes the Tastybush, so goes 
Planetrade Corporation.” 

S kroot removed his glasses and 
thoughtfully cleaned them on the 
front of his shirt. “My fee,” he 
said quietly, “will be one cent per 
bottle, for a one year period, com- 
mencing one year from the comple- 
tion of my task.” 

“What?” Shrieked Conners, half 
rising from his chair. “That’s rob- 
bery!” 

“Well now,” Skroot replied placid- 
ly with a shrug of his shoulders, “It’s 
not as bad as all that. If I don’t 
solve your problem, naturally, there 
will be no charge for my services.” 
Conners’ voice increased in volume 
and pitch. His face became redder 
with every second. “Do you realize 
how much money that is?”

IF 





“Yes, indeed I do, Mr. Conners,” 
replied Skroot, not the least perturbed 
by the outburst. “And it’s cheap at 
the price. Of course, there are other 
alternatives. You could engage some- 
one else or pay me a flat fee whether 
I should succeed or fail or you could 
put some of your staff people to 
work on the problem, or you could 
always just sit and go bankrupt.” 
Conners winced at the thought. 
“You bandit,” he said. “You know 
very well there’s no one else with 
your qualifications, and we’ve had 
our staff on it for two years already 
with no success, and we figure that 
you’ll probably fail too.” 

“I’m really too old to go hopping 
about on the planets at all, you know. 
I should have retired many years 
ago.” 

“With the fees you charge you 
could retire after a single job.” Con- 
ners deliberated for a moment, 
rapidly calculating on his fingers. 
“Okay, one cent per bottle it is, but 
only if you completely and perman- 
ently solve the problem.” 

“ni have my attorney draw up 
the contract,” Skroot said, “Of course, 
I am assuming that all of your rec- 
ords on the planet will be made 
available to me.” 

“Certainly,” Conners responded 
with no hesitation. “Anything that 
might help. But unfortunately there 
isn’t much we can give you.” 

Skroot looked puzzled. “It was my 
understanding that Planetrade Cor- 
poration always made complete and 
systematic surveys of the grass under 
its jurisdiction.” 

“Well, yes,” Conners said slowly. 
“That’s true. But there were, well, 



certain problems involved here. We 
really weren’t able to accomplish 
very much.” 

“Exactly what problems are you 
referring to, Mr. Conners?” 

C onners noticed Skroot’s suspicion 
and hastily said, “There’s 
nothing dangerous there, you under- 
stand. No hostile aborigines or large 
carnivores or anything like that.” 
Skroot’s eyes narrowed. “Are you 
attempting to conceal something?” 
“No, no, certainly not,” came the 
denial. “It’s just that the situation 
there is difficult to explain. It’s the 
weather. You might say it gets, well, 
a little thick sometimes.” 

“Thick?” asked Skroot. “Thick?” 
“Well, yes,” explained Conners, 
pursing his lips and looking at the 
ceiling. “No violent electrical storms 
or hurricanes or even a breeze for 
that matter. It’s just . thick.” He 
thought for a moment then\ added, 
“Precipitation is high; the visibility 
is correspondingly low.” 

“That doesn’t sound like much of 
a problem.” 

“On Gloomer it’s a problem, take 
my word for it.” Conners leaned for- 
ward and cupped his chin in his hand. 
“For instance, our radar survey of the 
planet clearly showed a small range 
of mountains about 2500 feet high 
not more than twenty miles from 
our trading post. They represent the 
highest point in the whole hemisphere. 
But would you believe it, a crew of 
geologists looked for the things for 
three months and couldn’t find them.” 
“Couldn’t find them?” Skroot 
asked incredulously. “Indeed? An en- 
tire mountain range? Most unusual.” 



THE TASTE OF MONEY

“That’s what I thought at the 
time.” 

“Well, then,” Skroot inquired, 
“what about a biological survey? 
Plants? Animals? That sort of thing.” 

“We’re not much better off there. 
Planetrade Corporation made a big 
grant to a university to send a crew 
of experts out to Gloomer to make 
a complete survey. We wanted an- 
other Challenger Expedition. And be- 
sides, it’s tax deductible.” 

“What happened?” 

4 4^^1^ell,” began Conners, “it took 
VV three years to organize the 
thing. There were thirty specialists 
and enough gear to keep them going 
for five years. 

“The geologists quit first. Right 
off the bat there was that thing with 
the mountain range; then it was an- 
other two months before they found 
even one little stone to work on. 
And that one turned out to be a piece 
of concrete that was accidentally 
transported from Earth. 

“Another one of the crew was an 
ornithologist. One of the world’s lead- 
ing authorities on woodpeckers. But 
as it turned out, there weren’t any 
woodpeckers on Gloomer, so he spent 
the rest of his time sitting and writ- 
ing his memoirs. 

“The ichthyologist had a better 
time of it. For a while, at least. Out 
on Gloomer, with all that rain and 
all, there are sluggish rivers scattered 
all over the place. We don’t know 
where they come from, or where 
they go, or how wide they are; but 
there are fish or something that live 
in them. 

“So he tried to catch a few with 



a net, which didn’t work. Then he 
tried a hook and line, but that didn’t 
work either. He lost his tackle as 
fast as he could throw it in. One day 
he became desperate and rigged a 
line out of some 3000-pound test 
towing cable with a hook the size of 
a small anchor on it. He baited 
the thing with five frozen chickens 
and tied the end to a big concrete 
monument the surveyors put in. 
Whatever it was that he hooked took 
the line, survey monument and all. 

“Poor guy,” Conners said sadly. 
“After all that time and effort, he 
didn’t even see one of the things. He 
couldn’t so much as publish a pre- 
liminary report. He finally had a 
nervous breakdown. 

“Then the surveyors quit. They 
were furious when they found out 
about that monument. After months 
of work it was the only thing they 
had managed to map.” 

Skroot listened with genuine sym- 
pathy. “Did the botanists accomplish 
anything?” 

“Yes and no,” explained Conners. 
“They began by describing and 
classifying the marsh grasses. Then 
they disagreed about which family 
one of the species belonged to and 
spent the rest of their time on the 
planet arguing about it.” 

“They didn’t work on the Tasty- 
bushes?” asked Skroot. 

“No, they wanted to finish the 
grass first. As far as I know they’re 
still arguing about it. After about six 
months, the whole crew got tired 
of the place and left.” 

“Well,” Skroot concluded, “at least 
I won’t have to spend several months 
reading academic papers.” He rose 

IF

from his seat as though he expected 
to hear a loud creaking noise from 
his back. “When do I leave?” 

n 

T he trip and touchdown were un- 
eventful. When Skroot stepped 
out of the ship’s elevator to the plan- 
et, its perpetual blanket of fog and 
mist closed in around him. 

“Mr. Skroot?” called a tall, bony 
man, wearing a hooded plastic jacket 
and waders, who loomed suddenly in- 
to his ten-foot range of vision. 

“Yes, as a matter of fact I am,” 
Skroot replied, squinting as though 
it would somehow help him in peer- 
ing through the soupy air. 

“I’m Felix Usher, superintendent 
of the Planetrade Corporation trad- 
ing post. Welcome to Gloomer.” His 
clenched jaw and deep-set eyes over- 
hung by shaggy black brows gave 
him an angry look. His normally 
snarling tone of voice completed the 
impression. “The chief beamed me 
that you were on your way. Here’s 
your oversuit.” 

Skroot took the plastic jacket and 
waders and began to pull them over 
his clothes as he peered myopically 
into the fog. “If I had suspected 
that the place was as bad as this, I 
would have demanded a larger fee.” 
“Don’t get all encouraged, Skroot,” 
Usher sneered, “this is the best day 
we’ve had in three weeks, and this 
is the dry season.” He led the way 
down a narrow path marked by flags 
on both sides. “When are you going 
to get to work?” 

“I just arrived a few minutes ago,” 
Skroot reminded him. “But I would 



like to have a look at these Tasty- 
bushes I’ve heard so much about. Is 
there time to do it today? It looks 
as though it’s almost nightfall.” 

“NightfaU, hell,” Usher growled, 
“it’s barely noon.” They stepped off 
the hard surface of the landing pad 
and promptly sank ankle deep into 
the spongy surface of the planet. “We 
can drive over into the swamp right 
now.” 

“How far is it?” Skroot asked. 

“A couple of miles,” Usher 
answered. “Be careful to stay on the 
path. We don’t want to lose you this 
quickly.” They trudged along for a 
few more paces when suddenly, a 
huge vehicle appeared through the 
mist. 

“This is how we get around. We 
call them swamp-cats. We have nine 
of them out here. No, eight,” he 
corrected. 

The sudden reduction piqued 
Skroot’s curiosity. “What happened 
to the ninth?” 

“Some clown came over to the 
trading post for a cup of coffee and 
forgot where he parked it. That was 
two weeks ago.” 

“You mean it’s within walking dis- 
tance of your trading post and you 
still can’t find it?” 

“This is Gloomer, remember?” re- 
sponded Usher. “It’s not only with- 
in walking distance, I could stand 
on the front porch and hit it with a 
stone, if I had a stone and knew 
which way to throw it. It’s nothing 
to worry about. We’ll find it sooner 
or later. We always do,” 

T hey clambered into the swamp- 
cat, and Usher pressed the

switch to turn the engine over. It 
growled and sputtered^ but nothing 
happened. ‘Ignition wet,” mumbled 
Usher. Finally it caught, and they 
moved ponderously down a road 
marked by posts spaced a few feet 
apart and painted fluorescent yellow. 
^ “I ordered waterproof ignition 
systems for all nf them,” Usher ex- 
plained. “Two years ago.” 

‘Two years?” asked Skroot in 
amazement. “Are you sure they 
haven’t forgotten?” 

“Oh, no,” he responded. “We’ve 
been corresponding about it quite 
regularly. Almost every mail delivery 
has something about it. The mail 
sacks aboard the ship you came on 
probably have three or four more 
letters for me on the ignition sys- 
tems alone.” 

“Isn’t two years a long time to 
wait?” 

“Not really. It’s not bad once you 
get used to the system. After all, the 
request had to go through three dif- 
ferent departments. Besides, I have 
plenty of mail to keep me busy,” 
“But two years?” 

“That’s not bad. The man I re- 
placed ordered some waterproof 
signal flares three and a half years 
ago, and they still haven’t come.” 
“Why on earth should it take 
that long?” 

“Special order. Waterproof signal 
flares aren’t regulation equipment, 
* and the corporation storehouse 
doesn’t stock them.” 

“Oh,” Skroot said, unable to im- 
agine an appropriate comment. “How 
soon win we reach the Tastybushes?” 
“Any time now.” Usher drove 
silently along. “Ah. There they are.” 



The swamp-cat sloshed to a stop just 
off the trail, in view of a small 
thicket of waist-high bushes and 
enormous thom-studded tree trunks 
which disappeared upward into the 
mist. 

Usher pointed to the bushes, 
scowling. “They used to be that 
thick all the way across that plain 
we just crossed. Now there’s nothing 
at all there except that lousy swamp 
grass.” 

“Is this the swamp?” queried 
Skroot. “It doesn’t look much differ- 
ent than the plain. Or around the 
spaceport, for that matter.” 

“It isn’t any different,” Usher 
growled. ‘The whole lousy planet 
is a swamp. You should see the trad- 
ing post.” 

The persistent and saturating mist 
had found its way into the closed cab 
of the swamp-cat, covering every 
surface with a thin gloss of tiny 
water droplets. Skroot watched in 
fascination as they merged to form 
little rivulets which flowed to the 
floor. When they climbed from the 
vehicle a small waterfall accompanied 
them out the door. 

T hey walked over to the clump 
of Tastybushes, Usher mumbling 
under his breath and stomping small, 
lavender-colored things under the heel 
of his waders. “Here’s what’s giving 
us all the trouble,” he snarled. 
“Caterpillars.” 

“Let’s have a look.” Skroot fell 
to his knees with a splash to examine 
the caterpillars Usher had missed. 
As he watched, he noticed the crush- 
ed remains of the victims slowly 
assuming their normal spherical 



56 



IF 




shapes. Soon they began creeping 
toward the Tastybushes again, like 
hairy little golf balls. 

“They’re tough to kill. You can’t 
just squash them,” Usher explained, 
tromping another to illustrate. “But 
you can blow them out — like this!” 
With that he snatched a long, rusty 
knife from its scabbard with a grace- 
ful swoop and threw it with a grunt 
at another of the caterpillars which, 
as he predicted, blew out with a 
liquid pop. Its reddish purple con- 
tents spewed out and immediately 
soaked into the ground. The cater- 
pillar shrank into an object which 
resembled a fuzzy pea. 

Skroot examined the carcass with 
great interest as Usher explained, “We 
tried killing them for a while, but it 
took so long that we finally just gave 
the collectors big bags to stuff them 
into. Then we dump them into the 
nearest river, and the fish — or 
whatever they are — eat them.” 

“Very interesting,” murmured 
Skroot. “The caterpillars, then, are 
killing your bushes?” 

“No, hell no,” Usher exclaimed. 
“They just eat the flowers before we 
can pick them.” He reached out and 
snatched a fuzzy lavender lump off 
the nearest bush and flung it to the 
ground, where he ground it under his 
heel. As they watched, it resumed 
its shape and continued its march. 

“It’s not too tough to keep them 
under control in our major collecting 
areas. We have a crew of men 
patrolling the place catching the 
caterpillars as soon as they climb 
down out of the Thorn trees. That’s 
where they come from, you know. 
Out of the Thorn trees.” 



“Out of the Thorn trees? You 
don’t say.” Skroot examined the near- 
est Thorn tree with new interest. 
Sure enough, four lavender caterpil- 
lars were threading their way down 
the trunk, detouring around the thick 
bases of the long, sharp thorns. 
While he wrote furiously in his book 
he asked, “If not the caterpillars, 
what, then, do you believe to be 
killing your Tastybushes?” 

“Old age, probably,” Usher said, 
kicking caterpillars away from a bush 
as though they were tiny soccer balls. 
“They die off in a couple of years, 
but there always used to be new 
plants to replace the dead ones. But 
lately there just haven’t been any 
young ones at all.” 

“Good heavens,” exclaimed Skroot, 
“I’m soaked to the skin, even with 
my oversuit on. Isn’t there some way 
to stay dry out here?” 

“That suit is standard corporation 
rain apparel, Skroot, that’s all there 
is. But don’t feel badly,” Usher con- 
soled, “everyone else is soaked too. 
You get soaked the day you arrive 
and you don’t dry out again until 
after you leave. On Gloomer the only 
time you can even smoke is when a 
ship is in the port. You can crawl 
into the cargo hold and seal all the 
hatches.” 

S kroot gazed intently at a Tasty- 
bush. “If the life span is only 
two years or so, they must mature 
fairly rapidly.” 

“They do,” Usher commented. 
“Everything does around here.” He 
pointed toward a Thom tree. “Even 
those things. They grow up and out 
of sight in two months.”

"My word,” exclaimed Skroot 
"How tall are they?” 

"Hell, I don’t know,” retorted 
Usher. "No one has ever seen the 
top of one.” 

"Very interesting,” Skroot murmur- 
ed, peering upward to the point where 
the thorny trunk disappeared into the 
gloom. Rivulets of water trickled 
down the frames of his glasses into 
his ears and evenutally dripped off 
his earlobes. Skroot tipped his head 
to one side and shook it violently. 
Although the procedure did get rid 
of the water on the left side, it 
caused the water to run further into 
his right ear. 

Usher laughed. "In a few days 
you’ll learn to pay no attention to 
things like that, Siioot. Or you’ll go 
mad. It’s a toss-up, I think.” 

"Indeed?” commented Skroot, 
watching yet another caterpillar 
swimming across a small puddle 
toward a Tastybush. "Have you tried 
less violent means to kill your cater- 
pillars?” 

"We’ve tried everything we could 
think of,” Usher said disgustedly. 
"We’ve tried insecticides of every 
description, irritants, repellents — 
you name it. The big problem is that 
whatever you use, if it touches the 
bushes they drop all their leaves, 
and the flowers to boot. And most 
of the time it doesn’t bother the 
caterpillars at all.” 

"You don’t say,” Skroot answered. 
"They just fall off? My word.” 
Usher pointed a scrawny index 
finger toward the smaU thicket. 
"Those lousy Tastybushes are more 
sensitive than the crew,” he growled, 
"and they’re terrible.” 



Skroot bent over a Tastybush, at- 
tempting to examine a leaf with his 
pocket magnifying ^ass. Its lens was 
completely beaded over with water. 

"We can’t even transplant the 
things,” complained Usher. "As soon 
as you touch them the leaves fall 
off; then the whole bush collapses.” 
"Collapses? Indeed? How do you 
mean?” 

"They just go limp,” shrugged 
Usher. "Then they fall on the ground. 
Some of them get up again, but 
mostly they don’t.” 

"According to the reports I’ve seen, 
there isn’t anything left to try,” 
Skroot agreed, smearing a finger 
across his glasses. They were now not 
only wet, but muddy. "It’s time to 
start on an entirely new line of in- 
vestigation.” 

"Whatever we do it had better be 
fast,” Usher commented. "If we 
don’t come up with an answer soon 
we stand to lose a pile of money.” 
"So I understand,” Skroot said, ob- 
serving that the mist had begun fall- 
ing more heavily. He groped his way 
back to the swamp-cat and opened 
the door. Another flood of water 
poured out of it. When he was seated, 
he opened his notebook and began 
scribbling urgently. 

"Why doesn’t that thing fall apart?” 
"It’s waterproof,” explained Skroot. 
"Just a plain, old fashioned water- 
proof field notebook.” 

"I ordered some a year ago,” 
Usher said, wistfully eyeing the book. 
"Accounting department turned them 
down. Too expensive.” 

"Good heavens. Usher, what do 
you write on? Ordinary paper would 
fall apart in five minutes.”

“I don’t write on anything. In 
fact, I haven’t written a word since 
I got to Gloomer.” 

Skroot .self-consciously tucked the 
dripping book back into its soggy 
holster. On the way back to the trad- 
ing post. Usher clearly outlined his 
©pinions of the planet (rotten), the 
weather (worst anywhere), the crew 
(a bunch of lazy misfits) and money 
(this he liked). 

‘The only reason I’m here,” 
Usher explained, “is because I can 
earn enough in a single five-year 
hitch to retire to Bathsheba. Now 
there’s a planet.” 

T hey finally reached the trading 
post, and Skroot was not really 
surprised to see a small waterfall gush- 
ing over the doorsill. 

“It’s a lot better now than it used 
to be,” Usher commented. “We japk- 
ed up one end of the building, so 
now the water runs out. It used to 
be terrible.” 

The floor was canted sufficiently 
to make Skroot uncomfortable. The 
tilt of the room was made more 
obvious by the pictures and graphs 
tacked to the walls. They hung 
straight, but at a distinct angle to 
the floor. 

“You know,” Skroot offered, “this 
is just like a fun house at an amuse- 
ment park.” 

“Skroot,” Usher observed coldly, 
“if there’s anything this place isn’t, 
it’s a fun house.” 

“I must say, it’s difficult for one 
to become adjusted to it. It’s as 
though one of my legs were shorter 
than the other.” 

“We argued that out long before 



you got here, Skroot. We decided that 
it feels as though one leg were 
longer. You’re outvoted.” Usher 
sluiced most of the water off his 
chair and sat down at his desk. 
“Where’s my briefcase?” he asked 
rhetorically, looking about the room 
for it. “Oh, there it is. Skroot, how 
about handing it to me?” 

Skroot’s gaze followed Usher’s 
pointing finger until he spotted the 
briefcase jammed into a pile of rub- 
ble at the low end of the room 
where it had been swept to by the 
sheet of water which slid rapidly 
across the floor. He noticed that 
several holes had been cut through 
the floor where cabinets and desks 
impeded the water’s flow, and each 
hole was surrounded by a tiny gurg- 
ling whirlpool. 

“Thanks,” Usher grunted as Skroot 
handed him the briefcase. “Now let’s 
get down to business. What do you 
think?” 

“As yet it is difficult to say,” 
Skroot began, “I’ve hardly had an 
opportunity to investigate, but I in- 
tend to begin immediately.” 

He consulted his notebook. “To 
begin with,” he said, “I shall need 
two men to assist me in my investi- 
gations, a swamp-cat and free access 
to your tools and equipment. In ad- 
dition, I will set aside an area with 
its Tastybushes intact and will per- 
mit no collecting where my work is 
being conducted.” 

“You want what?” shouted Usher 
explosively. “Do you also want my 
left arm and all my money?” Drop- 
lets of water flew from his finger as 
he shook it at Skroot. “Do you have 
any idea what that will cost me? 



THE TASTE OF MONEY

Personally? My commissions come 
out of the net profit of this trading 
post. And now you want me to 
give you expensive equipment and 
fuel and take two men off their 
collection routes? And take a bunch 
of Tastybushes out of production? 
Skroot, you’re out of your mind I” 
Skroot sat placidly with his hands 
folded in his lap, water dripping 
rapidly off the tips of his fingers. 
When Usher finished his tirade, 
Skroot outlined alternatives until 
there was grudging agreement. 

ni 

E arly the next morning Skroot and 
his two assistants departed for 
the chosen area with a load of tools 
and miscellaneous gear. “Gentlemen,” 
he explained, “my task is to prevent 
the loss of flavor extract to Planetrade 
Corporation. I intend to accomplish 
this as quickly and as simply as 
possible.” 

“I figured it was something like 
that,” said Jake. 

“So did I,” added Harry, “only 
first. I mentioned it to Jake while 
we were waiting for you,” he ex- 
plained to Skroot. 

‘That don’t mean you thought of 
it first, you bum,” Jake shouted. 

“Gentlemen,” soothed Skroot, “if 
you do exactly as I say, quickly and 
efficiently, our work will soon be 
completed.” 

‘That’s a laugh,” chortled Harry. 
“The reason Usher sent Jake out 
with you is because he ain’t done 
nothing quickly or efficently since 
he got to Gloomer.” 

“You should talk,” countered 



Jake. “Usher sent Harry out here 
because he’s the clumsiest so-and-so 
on the planet. The only reason he’s 
still here at all is because he ain’t 
worth the cost of shipping back to 
Earth.” 

The swamp-cat mushed to a stop in 
view of two or three Tastybushes and 
a pair of thick, spiny Thorn trees. 
“Gentlemen,” Skroot began again, as 
though he hadn’t heard their exchange 
of insults, “our first task is to dis- 
cover whether we can recover the ex- 
tract of the Tastybush more efficent- 
ly than by collecting their blossoms. 
This is the most simple solution to 
the caterpillar menace. Our second 
task, to discover why there are no 
young Tastybushes, wDl begin short- 
ly.” 

Jake and Harry slowly climbed 
down from the swamp-cat and stood 
quietly, glumly watching the lavender 
caterpillars meandering slowly across 
the ground. 

“If we are to maintain my experi- 
mental schedule, we must begin im- 
mediately,” Skroot announced. “Our 
first task is to attempt to recover 
sap from the trunk of a Tastybush 
for analysis. I understand we must 
be delicate in the process.” 

“Delicate ain’t the word for it, 
Skroot, it won’t work,” Jake said 
flatly. “We already tried it.” 

“Indeed?” asked Skroot? “V/hen?” 

“Well, actually I didn’t personally 
try it, but somebody or other did a 
few years ago, and he said it didn’t 
work.” Jake remained convinced that 
further attempts would be hopeless. 

Harry commented, “I know the 
guy that tried it. That clod is about 
as delicate as a bomb.”

‘‘Do either of you gentlemen have 
any idea of the technique he used,” 
Skroot asked patiently. 

“Yeah,” responded Harry. “He told 
me that the boss wanted some sap 
to test, but he didn’t say how to get 
it. So he walked up to a bush and 
stepped on it to bend it over. Then 
he took a cut at it with his knife.” 
“With what result?” 

“Just what you might expect. As 
soon as he touched the thing, it gave 
a good shake, and all the leaves fell 
off. Then it went limp and collapsed. 
But it didn’t get cut up too badly, 
so a few days later it came up again.” 
“It seems obvious,” Skroot explain- 
ed, “that one must use extreme deli- 
cacy with a plant which is sensitive 
to tactile stimulii. We will be much 
more gentle.” 

“I know more about them things 
than you do, Skroot,” Jake an- 
nounced, “and it ain’t going to 
work.” 

“It is entirely possible that it will 
not,” Skroot replied patiently, “but 
we must exclude all possibilities.” 

S kroot shook the water out of the 
dissection kit which he carried and 
slowly crept beneath the branches of 
a Tastybush, being very careful to 
avoid touching them. Very gently he 
pushed aside the grass which sur- 
rounded the trunk, and very tender- 
ly he made a small incision about 
four inches above the ground. 

The Tastybush reacted as Jake had 
predicted; it began to shake vigorous- 
ly, its foliage dropping to the ground 
in a flurry. Immediately the branch- 
lets began to sag, then the major 
branches, and finally the entire plant 



collapsed before their eyes into a 
small ghostly pile. 

“I say there,” Skroot exclaimed in 
surprise, untangling the flaccid 
branches which had somehow become 
entangled in his eyeglass frames. “It 
did indeed collapse. How extraordi- 
nary.” 

“You can’t say I didn’t tell you 
so,” Jake shouted triumphantly, nod- 
ding his head vigorously in affirma- 
tion. 

“It appears, then,” Skroot ponder- 
ed, “that the Tastybush is similar to 
the caterpillars in that their shapes 
are maintained through turgidity. The 
pressure of their internal fluids 
causes them to fill out their shapes,” 
Skroot frantically entered the new in- 
formation into his notebook. 

“Next,” Skroot announced, “since 
it appears that the Tastybush causes 
its fluids to flow into the root sys- 
tem for protection, thus causing to 
bush to collapse, we must use other 
means to extract a sample. Harry, 
get the first-aid kit from the swamp- 
cat. You. Jake, select a bush which 
has few branches near the ground.” 

As the two disappeared into to 
mist in opposite directions, Skroot 
removed his glasses and wiped them 
on his wet plastic oversuit, leaving 
them no cleaner or dryer. 

“Here’s a good bush over here, 
Skroot,” called Jake, as Harry re- 
turned with the first-aid kit. 

“Where, Jake?” Skroot shouted 
peering uselessly into the fog. 

“Over here,” Jake answered help- 
fully, “about fifteen feet or so.” 

Skroot opened to lid of the kit 
and pushed a half dozen floating 
bottles of salt tablets aside, groping 



THE TASTE OF MONEY

among the objects which had sunk 
to the bottom. “Salt tablets?” he ask- 
ed. 

“It’s a regulation corporation first- 
aid kit,” Harry explained. 

“Aha!” Skroot said. “Got it. Gen- 
tlemen, this may be our answer.” He 
dredged up a tourniquet, tangled in- 
to two sodden rolls of gauze and 
some adhesive tape. 

“Come on, Skroot, what are you 
talking about?” asked Harry in a dis- 
gusted tone of voice. 



“Essentially this, gentlemen.” He 
swung the wet tourniquet like a garot- 
te. “We impede the flow of the sap 
returning to the root system. Thus, 
with the sap trapped in the branches 
of the plant, we will be able to ex- 
tract our sample for analysis.” 

Jake shook his head negatively. 
“Usher ain’t going to like this, Skroot. 
That Tastybush is going to die just 
sure as anything.” 

Skroot paid no attention, crawling 
beneath the dripping bush clutching

the tourniquet. He passed it gently 
around the short trunk and with a 
quick jerk pulled it tight and twisted. 

As the tourniquet constricted the 
trunk of the tree, it began to quiver 
and shake, and a cloud of leaves fell 
to the ground. The tips of the de- 
nuded branchlets went limp, and the 
major branches began to droop. 

Skroot nervously watched a bulge 
form in the trunk above the tourni- 
quet. The tastybush twitched and 
sagged, and the bulge steadily grew 

THE TASTE OF MONEY 



in size until it was fully five or six 
times the diameter of the trunk. 

“Jump back, Skroot!” Harry 
shouted, “If that thing blows it’ll take 
your head clean off.” He and Jake 
hit the ground with a splash as 
Skroot tenaciously clung to the final 
twist of the tourniquet. 

S kroot opened one tightly clenched 
eye and squinted through a 
watery lens at the bulge in the trunk, 
which was now shrinking to its 

63 





normal size. The upper branches near 
the trunk became turgid again, and 
the bush took on an almost normal 
appearance. “Jake,” he shouted, 
“come over here and hold this tourni- 
quet while I make the incision.” 

Jake fearfully crawled under the 
bare branches of the Tastybush and 
took hold of the tourniquet. “What- 
ever happens,” Skroot ordered, 
“don’t let go.” 

“Harry,” Skroot shouted, “bring 
me that plastic bucket from the 
swamp-cat. And hurry.” 

Harry sluiced the water out of the 
bucket as he slogged rapidly back 
to the bush. Skroot seized one of the 
stiff branches and lunged at it with 
his scalpel. The branch immediately 
went limp; but the branches on the 
opposite side bulged out and shook. 

Skroot held the flaccid branch in 
his hand. “Give me the bucket and 
go shake up the other side of the 
bush. That should cause the fluid 
to flow again to this side.” 

Harry grabbed a major branch in 
each hand and began alternately 
shaking and twisting them. Soon 
Skroot’s branch began to stiffen. 
“Aha!” he shouted triumphantly and 
plunged the scalpel into it. The 
branch cringed as he sat down on 
the ground with the bucket between 
his knees. The fluid began to squirt 
noisily into it. “Keep shaking, Harry.” 
Skroot encouraged the flow by 
squeezing the branch near the trunk 
and sliding his fingers toward the tip 
of the branch. Each stroke brought a 
spurt of liquid into the frothy bucket. 
The three paid no attention to the 
sound of a swamp-cat mushing to a 
stop a short distance away. 



U sher’s mouth dropped open as the 
scene unfolded through the fall- 
ing mist. Jake continued to cling to 
the tourniquet while Harry shook 
the limp branches to force the fluid 
to Skroot, who sat intently aiming 
spurts of sap at the bucket. “Just 
what in hell are you doing to that 
bush?” he screamed, his face turning 
pale. “You’re killing it!” He seized 
Jake’s legs and began to tug at 
them, trying to drag him away from 
the Tastybush. 

“Let go of my legs,” Jake yelled, 
hanging grimly onto the tourniquet. 
“Skroot, make him let go of my 
legs.” 

“I was better off with the lousy 
caterpillars!” Usher screamed, giving 
Jake’s legs a final tug. Jakes fingers 
slipped, and his chin ploughed a fur- 
row through the ground as Usher 
dragged him backward. The furrow 
rapidly filled with water as the bush 
collapsed. Harry stood there, tenta- 
tively shaking two spaghettilike 
branches, while Skroot’s dangled 
limply into the bucket. 

Water ran out of Usher’s sleeve as 
he shook a knobby fist at Skroot. “I 
thought you came out here to find 
out what’s killing the bushes — not 
to start slaughtering them yourself.” 
Skroot approached him, bucket in 
hand. “1 would deeply appreciate it, 
Usher, if you would not interfere 
with my work or with my staff.” 
“That’s telling him, Skroot,” 
cheered Jake. 

Skroot handed the bucket to Usher. 
“Here is a sample of the plant’s 
internal fluid. Please have it com- 
pletely analyzed.” The intended 
severity of his words was somewhat 



64 



IF 




diluted by the water which trickled 
off the end of his nose. 

Usher grabbed the bucket angrily 
and without further comment he 
stalked back to his swamp-cat, spac- 
ing his steps to flatten the caterpillars 
in his path. By the time he reached 
the swamp-cat, all of them had bal- 
looned out again and were creeping 
toward the Tastybushes as though 
nothing had happened. 

“I told you he’d be mad,” Jake 
said. 

“Gentlemen,” Skroot said, ignor- 
ing him, “we have completed phase 
one of my experimental design. We 
will immediately begin phase two.” 
He began writing in his dripping but 
still stiff notebook, ignoring the trick- 
le of water which ran dowfi the bar- 
rel of his pen, into little puddles 
across the words he wrote. 

“Jake, I want you to climb one 
of the Thorn trees to see if you can 
discover the source of the caterpillars. 
When you reach the top I want you 
to shout down to me and describe 
what you see.” 

“You’re out of your head, 
Skroot,” Harry diagnosed, “Jake can’t 
climb one of them trees. There ain’t 
nobody who can climb one.” 

“Why, may I ask?” 

“Just take a look at them thorns,” 
Jake said. “Every one pointed down. 
Even the caterpillars don’t crawl back 
up. Only down. Besides, how do I 
know how far I have to climb? I 
might get up there three or four 
hundred feet, and I wouldn’t be able 
to yell loud enough for you to hear 
me. On top of that, how do I know 
what else might be up there? No, 
sir. I might get up there, and no one 



would ever see me again. Like one 
of them Indians rope tricks.” 

Skroot inspected one of the thorns 
and tested its sharpness with the tip 
of a finger. “You’re quite correct, 
Jake. It would indeed be difficult 
to climb one of these trees.” 

“You bet it would be tough,” 
Jake agreed. “You can’t do it.” 
“Nevertheless, we must observe the 
source of the caterpillars. Harry, 
bring an axe from the swamp-cat 
and chop it down.” 

“You’re insane, Skroot,” Harry 
gasped. “That thing is a good three 
feet thick, and who knows how tall. 
And you want me to chop it down?” 
“Let us face facts,” Skroot ex- 
plained patiently. ^ “It is, after all, 
a part of phase two. No one has ever 
observed the place of origin of the 
caterpillars. Further, no one has ever 
observed a caterpillar climbing back 
upl” 

“Hell, no,” retorted Jake, “nothing 
can get up one of them trees.” 
“Phase two must begin,” Skroot in- 
sisted. “Harry, get the axe.” 

As Harry sullenly plodded toward 
the vehicle, Skroot reached into his 
gadget bag, displacing several ounces 
of water which splashed to the 
ground. His hand emerged holding a 
small can of fluorescent yellpw paint. 

“Jake, take this and place identi- 
fying marks on several caterpillars as 
they climb down the trunk of a 
Thom tree. Then watch them care- 
fully to observe their activities. And 
be careful not to disturb them in 
any way.” 

Harry reappeared through the mist 
carrying a double-bit axe with a rust- 
ed head. Jake shouted, “Start chop- 



THE TASTE OF MONEY

ping, Harry, while I go paint cater- 
pillars. Ha.” 

F or the first time since his arrival, 
Skroot began to show signs of 
impatience and anger; he glowered 
at Jake and demanded, “Harry, give 
me the axe!” 

Harry viewed Skroot with suspicion 
as Jake quickly disappeared into the 
gloom without another word. “Give 
me the axe,” Skroot repeated. He 
placed his foot atop a deadfall, raised 
the axe and took careful aim at it. 

“Jake,” Harry shouted, “come here 
and take a look at this. Skroot 
flipped. He’s going to chop off his 
foot.” 

Jake approached warily to see if 
what Harry said was true. “You can’t 
do that, Skroot. Them waders is 
corporation property. You can’t go 
chopping them up with an axe.” 
Gentlemen,” Skroot said calmly, 
“as corporate employees you may 
be enjoined from damaging corporate 
property. But I am not” With that 
he brought the axe down sharply, 
cleanly severing the toe of his rein- 
forced plastic wader. Three or four 
gallons of water gushed out and im- 
mediately disappeared into the 
ground. He repeated the process with 
his right wader, but somewhat less 
gracefully. 

“Jake, Skroot warned, “you are 
not observing the caterpillars as I 
asked you to.” Jake shook his head 
and disappeared into the mist. 
“Harry, take the axe and chop down 
a Thom tree.” 

Usher’s swamp-cat slurped to a 
stop nearby and soon he appeared 
through the gloom. “What are you

clowns up to now?” he asked. “I 
just passed Jake crawling on to 
hands and knees following caterpil- 
lars with faces painted on them. 
Skioot, what in hell is going cm?” 

“Well,” explained Skroot, “we’re 
in phase two of my research plan: 
Jake is observing the behavior of 
several caterpillars, and Harry is 
about to cut down this Thorn tree.” 

“He’s what? Oh, no!” Usher shout- 
ed. “Harry, stop!” But Harry’s axe 
had already begun its swing. In at- 
tempting to stop it he merely lost his 
balance and fell to the ground with 
a splat. 

Usher turned to run as the axe 
bit into the trunk of the Thorn tree, 
but it was too late. The trunk split 
open. The reddish purple liquid 
spurted out in a solid stream, passing 
over the prostrate Harry. It caught 
Usher full in the back, propelling 
him a full twenty feet, out of sight, 
into a clump of Tastybushes which 
promptly began shaking and dropping 
their leaves. 

Skroot observed with great inter- 
est, watching hundreds of gallons of 
fluid pouring out the rent in the 
trunk. He could hear Usher’s cursing 
above the roaring and splashing of 
the torrent. 

The stream slowed down as the 
great Thorn tree slowly shrank and 
collapsed upon itself hke an enor- 
mous concertina. Usher eventually 
clambered out of the thicket of de- 
nuded and collapsed Tastybushes and 
shouted, “Skroot, you madman. Are 
you trying to kill us all?” Four or 
five caterpillars clung to him, which 
he angrily threw to the ground as he 
stalked forward. 



“And look at the toes on your 
oversuit 1 You’re going to pay for 
those things. This is the end. I don’t 
care what headquarters has to say. 
It’s either you or me. This is abso- 
lutely the end.” 

“In a manner of speaking, you 
may be at least partially correct, you 
know,” Skroot answered happily. 
“We may indeed be nearing the end. 
In your right pocket you have ap- 
proximately a liter of the liquid fiom 
the Thorn tree. In your left you will 
discover a caterpillar.” 

Usher winced. “Please conduct an 
analysis of both,” Skroot continued, 
“and compare the results with the 
sample from the Tastybush. Then in- 
form me of the result immediately.” 

U sher was unable to speak a word, 
but the expression on his face 
conveyed this emotions. He turned 
abruptly and disappeared in the di- 
rection of his swamp-cat. 

Skroot walked over to the former 
Thorn tree, the top of which was 
now perched atop a large pile of 
ghostly trunk skin studded ^th sharp 
spikes. “Harry, come over "here and 
observe this,” Skroot said. Slowly and 
with great effort, Harry trudged over 
and stood next to the remains of the 
Thorn tree. With each step he sunk 
almost knee deep into the ground. 

“Look, Harry, here are great clus- 
ters of caterpillars actually growing 
out of the top of the Thorn tree!” 
“I’ll be darned. I never saw any- 
thing like that around here before.” 
“My word,” Skroot said. “Here’s a 
cluster of immature ones still at- 
tached by tiny stalks. Good heavens, 
I must, publish a description.” 



THE TASTE OF MONEY

“Hey, Skroot!” Jake shouted from 
somewhere out in the ^oom. “These 
here caterpillars just crawled into a 
Tastybush.” 

“Surprise, surprise,” shouted Harry 
in response. “What did you expect 
them to do?” 

“Don’t touch them, Jake watch 
them,” cautioned Skroot. “Where are 
you?” 

“Over here,” came the helpful 
answer. “In this clump of Tasty- 
bushes,” Skroot and Harry could see 
neither Jake nor the Tastybushes, but 
they followed the sound of his voice 
until they reached a clump with 
water-filled hand and knee prints 
pointed into it. “I’m in here,” Jake 
shouted again, “and the caterpillars 
are eating flowers.” 

“Keep watching them,” Skroot re- 
peated, “but don’t touch them.” 

“Quit yelling,” Jake responded. 
“I’m only ten feet away — I think.” 
Harry sank further into the ground 
with each moment that passed, mak- 
ing slurping noises every time he 
moved. “Harry,” Skroot asked curi- 
ously, “what on earth is the matter 
with you?” 

“Nothing at all,” Harry answered 
calmly. “It’s just that my waders 
filled up with Thorn tree sap, and 
they’re kind of heavy.” 

“Why don’t you chop off the toes 
and allow the liquid to escape?” 

“You crazy?” demanded Harry. 
“And have to pay for them?” He lay 
down on his back and with great ef- 
fort, lifted his legs into the air. The 
contents of his waders flushed out, 
almost drowning him. “That’s just 
as good,” he sputtered, “and cheap- 
er” 



“Hey, Skroot,” came Jake’s call 
from the Tastybushes. ‘The caterpil- 
lars finished the flowers, and they’re 
climbing down off the bush.” 

“Aha I” exclaimed Skroot “Don’t 
lose track of them.” Skroot leafed 
back and forth through the pages of 
his notebook, frequently sluicing the 
water off his glasses, “Aha!” he re- 
peated. 

4 4 Qkroot, here’s one of them paint- 
^ ed ones,” called Harry. As they 
watched, a caterpillar with a snaggle- 
toothed face painted on its smoothed- 
down fur crawled from the bushes and 
crept across the ground. 

“Jake, I asked you to watch them,” 
shouted Skroot in annoyance. 

“Don’t worry, Skroot, there’s stiH 
five of them in here.” 

Skroot carefully observed the prog- 
ress of the colorful little caterpillar. 
It stopped. 

“What do you suppose the thing’s 
going to do now?” Harry asked. 

“Well,” Skroot began, “according 
to one of my working hypotheses . .” 
“Look at the thing!” exclaimed 
Harry in surprise. “It’s digging a hole. 
It’s burying itself!” 

“Aha!” cried Skroot triumphantly. 
“I thought so!” He watched until the 
tiny hole filled in with water and the 
caterpillar was no longer visible. 
“Jake,” Skroot shouted toward the 
Tastybushes, “come out instantly. 
We’re off for the trading post.” 

“Fat chance,” Jake complained. 
“I can’t move. I’m stuck. I’ll probably 
starve to death in here.” 

“Those are all Tastybushes,” in- 
structed Skroot, “just grab a couple 
and start shaking them.” Jake did so, 

IF

and immediately several of them 
dropped their leaves and collapsed. 
Jake walked unimpeded from the 
center of the thicket. 

Water cascaded from the front seat 
of the swamp-cat as Skroot opened 
the door. They clambered aboard and 
proceeded at a breakneck pace, send- 
ing up a small bow wave in the soak- 
ed and porous ground. 

They mushed to a stop in front 
of the trading post, the cataract of 
water still pouring out its front door. 
Skroot sloshed into the building, his 
waders followed by tiny wakes as he 
crossed the floor to Usher’s desk.

U sher was seated there, searching 
for something in his lower left 
drawer, which was filled to the top 
with water. “I wish I could con- 
vince the supply department that I 
really need things that float. Oh, 
well, if I did, I probably couldn’t 
convince the accounting department 
that it was worth the extra cost. Half 
of our equipment sinks out of sight 
somewhere on the first day after it 
gets here.” Usher continued to feel 
around in the bottom of the water 
filled drawer. 

“Why don’t you punch holes in 
the bottom?” asked Skroot, consider- 
ing that the simplest solution to the 
problem. 

“Because it’s corporation property, 
that’s why,” sneered Usher, “and I’d 
have to pay for it.” He grimaced 
angrily at Skroot. “Is that all you ever 
think of? Damaging corporation pro- 
perty? What do you want now, you 
vandal?” 



Unperturbed, Skroot said pleasant- 
ly, “I was curious to know whether 
those samples have been analyzed.” 
“Yes, they have,” Usher replied, 
“and I’m sorry to say it, but you hit 
pay dirt. Tastybush juice is loaded 
with flavor; Thorn- tree juice is loaded 
with flavor, and even that lousy cater- 
pillar juice is loaded with flavor.” 
“Aha! Excellent, excellent,” chor- 
tled Skroot. 

“Now we don’t have to worry 
about those lousy Tastybushes dying 
off. We’ll start on the Thorn trees 
first. They’re the easiest, and they 
grow just as fast. Then if we need 
more we’ll go after the caterpillars.” 
“Well, no,” responded Skroot. 
“I’m afraid you can’t do that.” 
“Skroot, you nut, of course we 
can. We know it’s possible now.” 
“It’s not as simple as that,” ex- 
plained Skroot. “You see, there is 
a somewhat complex ecological and 
reproductive cycle involved here.” 
“Explain,” demanded Usher. 
“Well,” he began, “on Earth a 
similar situation exists in certain 
plants which we refer to as “dio- 
ecious,” from the Greek roots dis, 
meaning two, and oikos, meaning 
house. In effect, it means two 
houses.” 

“So what?” Usher interrupted, 
pounding his fist on the desk, shower- 
ing tiny droplets of water across the 
room. “Greek roots be damned. 
What’s going on?” 

Refusing to be interrupted, Skroot * 
continued. “You see, dioecious plants 
actually have two sexes. Very simply, 
we have boy plants which produce 
pollen and girl plants which produce 
blossoms.” He cleared his throat. 



THE TASTE OF MONEY

“The pollen floats through the air, 
blown to the flowers of the female 
plants of the same species. The pol- 
len fertilizes the blossoms, and seeds 
develop within them. When the seeds 
mature, they are distributed in various 
ingenious ways.” 

“So much for the lecture, Skroot. 
What are you trying to say?” 
“Simply that the plants you refer 
to as Thorn trees and Tastybushes 
are in fact merely male and female 
plants of the same species.” 

“Aw, come on, Skroot, they don’t 
look anything at all alike.” 

S kroot tsk-ed at him. “Don’t allow 
external appearances to deceive 
you. On Earth, for example, several 
genera display sexual dimorphism to 
an amazing extent.” 

“To hell with that, Skroot,” Usher 
demanded. “Get on with it. What 
about the caterpillars?” 

“Ah, yes, the caterpillars. An in- 
teresting adaptation. The environ- 
ment here simply isn’t conducive to 
the distribution of airborne pollen — 
the lack of wind and the constanl 
mist, you know. 

“So. just as in the cases of certain 
plants on Earth, the reproductive cells 
have become highly mobile. The spe- 
cies has evolved a form of pollen 
which propels itself down the trunk 
of the male plant and across the 
ground to the female plant, the Tasty- 
bush.” 

“I’ll be darned.” exclaimed Usher. 



“Why then do they eat the flowers?” 
“Actually, they don’t really eat 
them. I doubt whether they eat at 
all. The mobile pollen grains merely 
migrate to the Tastybushes to fertilize 
themselves by absorbing the blossoms. 
Then, after fertilization, they can 
truly be called mobile seeds.” 
“Seeds?” asked Usher in astonish- 
ment. “You mean to tell me that all 
these years we’ve been feeding Tasty- 
bush seeds to the fish, or whatever 
they are?” 

“Indeed you have been,” chuckled 
Skroot. “Of course, some of them 
would grow into Thorn trees to pro- 
vide a new male generation.” 

“Then if we plant caterpillars, they 
will grow into Thorn trees and Tasty- 
bushes?” 

“Indeed they will, Usher, indeed 
they will. I suggest you begin train- 
ing your crew to begin replanting im- 
mediately. In a few months from 
now you should be able to harvest 
your first crop. I would personally 
appreciate it if you would hurry. Af- 
ter all, my commissions begin only a 
year from now.” 

U sher, Jake and Harry stood to 
the side of the ship to view the 
departure of Charles Darwin Skroot. 
He slogged aboard the loading ele- 
vator. emptied the water from his 
equipment bag, smeared the rivulets 
from his glasses with a wet finger 
and waved good-by as he disappeaied 
upward into the hold. END

L ast time, if you I'emember, 
we were talking about the fact 
that neither science fiction itself nor 
science-fiction fandom are exclusive- 
ly American phenomena. Fans, fan 
clubs, conventions and fanzines are 
found all over the globe, including 
some places where you would never 
expect to find them. 

Down in South Africa, there’s a 
fan named Roger Clegg ... in 
Stockholm, Sweden, there’s Carl 
Brandon ... a fan named Osvaldo 
Elliff lives in La Plata, Argentina 
. in Certh, Scotland, there’s Brian 
Hill . Tokyo, Japan, boasts of a 
fan named Yukiko Yesuoka . 
then there’s Leland Shapiro in Sas- 
katoon, Canada . Jannick Storm 
in Denmark . Walt Willis in Ire- 
land . Tom Schluck in Hanover, 
West Germany, Jack Wodhams in 
Queensland, Australia . Ugo 



Malaguti in Bologna, Italy . Jack 
Knight in New Zealand . and — 
well, I guess you get the idea! 

What kind of fan activities go on 
in other countries? Quite a vaiiety, 
actually. In Hannut, Belgium, Mi- 
chael Feron publishes a monthly 
bilingual fanzine called Early Bird. 
A sample of the contents: news 
about the 1966 science-fiction fan 
convention in Vienna, reviews of 
sf mags published in France and 
a look at a Canadian science-fiction 
movie. - 

On May 29, 1966, the fcuith an- 
nual meeting of Japan’s only sf fan 
club met in Tokyo with more than 
sixty fans attending. Among the 
items thrashed out in open discus- 
sion were the nature of the club’s 
forthcoming fanzine (the Japanese 
word for ‘Tanzine,” by the way, 
seems to be “Uchukiryu.” Remem-

ber, you read it first in //!) and 
plans for the annual national 
science-fiction convention which 
was held in Nagoya, one of the 
bigger cities in east Japan. 

Down in South America, the news 
of the hour is that The Hohhit (as 
*'El Hobito”) has just been pub- 
lished there. Spanish-speaking fans 
south of the border are now hope- 
fully awaiting the full Lord of the 
Rings trilogy. Also, Fve heard on 
the fannish grapevine that a fan- 
zine called Argentine SF Review has 
been published. As I haven’t actual- 
ly seen a copy, I can’t announce it 
for certain. 

In Trieste, the annual science- 
fiction film festival audience watch- 
ed an ambitious color film from 
Yugoslavia called Sedrni Kontinent 
(“Seventh Continent”), a directorial 
first by the noted and prize-winning 
Yugoslav animator, Dusan Vukotic, 
which Variety, the American show- 
biz weekly newspaper, thought was 
an uneven but stimulating attempt 
to blend satire and fantasy into a 
film for both kids and adults. 

And in Calcutta, India, of all 
places, there’s a lively and boom- 
ing science-fiction fan club with 
over fifteen hundred members 
(“and a long waiting list,” reports 
The New Yorker), Star member of 
the Calcutta fandom is the brilliant, 
internationally celebrated Bangali 
film director, Satyajit Ray {Father 
Panchali, Aparajito, The World of 
ApUy etc.), who is not only a wild- 
ly enthusiastic sf fan and reader, 
but author as well — in India he 
writes juvenile sf for teen-agers. Fur- 
thermore, Mr. Ray is reportedly now 
72 



at work on a new science-fiction 
film, a joint Bengali-American pro- 
duction whose working title h The 
Alien, which is supposed to star 
Peter Sellers as an Indian business- 
man who discovers a flying saucer 
or something. The script, last I 
heard, was also a joint effort — 
between Arthur C. Clarke and Mr. 
Ray. 

But of all the countries in which 
sf fandom is active, the most in- 
teresting to us Americans would 
be Great Britain, which reads much 
of the same fiction we get over here 
and which also has an annual con- 
vention. In fact, let’s take a look 
at the British 1967 convention. 

The Bristol Convention 

Over the Easter holidays this year, 
the eyes of British fandom were 
fixed on Bristol, a large (41 square 
miles), ancient (founded in the 
reign of the Saxon king, Aethelred 
the Unready, 978-1016 A.D.) city 
with about a half million inhabitants. 

To Bristol’s Hawthorn Hotel 
flocked science-fiction authors, edi- 
tors, artists, fans, collectors and just 
plain readers. Guest of Honor was 
John Brunner, whose name you 
must have seen in If and on the 
paperback stands many, many times 
(he’s written 21 novels that I can 
think of, and probably I’ve missed 
a few). He gave a lucid speech on 
unauthorized mucking-about with an 
author’s stuff as done by some pub- 
lishers in America. As a case in 
point, he mentioned his recent novel 
The Production of Time (I’m not 
sure whether he said the editors 

IF 




had made fifty changes on the first 
page or just in the first chapter) ^ 
then went on to develop the theme 
that far too many sf writers of 
today seem to be firmly 19th Cen- 
tury so far as their choice of plots 
goes. He said they didn’t seem to 
be really aware of the enormous 
possibilities open to those of us who 
work within the science-fiction field, 
where plot and setting are capable 
of literally infinite variety. 

Besides John Brunner, a host of 
other writers attended the Bristol 
con: James White (author of All 
Judgment Fled) and Judith Merrill, 
on hand to represent the American 
writers, not to mention Michael 
Moorcock. The convention opened 
with a bang when Brian W. Aldiss 
made all the Big Names present 
stand up and look sheepish while 
he “introduced” them. 

The convention program had a 
delightful variety of entertainment 
and business. There were movies, 
including a showing of sf cover 
artist Ed Emsh’s Underground mo- 
vie, Relativity. There was a sherry 
& cider party for informal icebreak- 
ing. There was a mock-Medieval 
pagent whereat some local celebri- 
ties were initiated into The Loyal 
and Ancient Order of St. Fantony 
(the patron saint of science fiction 
fans, you know), attended by some 
60 spectators. And there was the 
giving out of the British Fantasy 
Awards, the English equivalent of 
our own Hugos. One of our boys 
figured large in this, when Philip 
K. Dick won for his novel. The 
Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch. 
Another award went to Michael 
FOREIGN FANDOM 



Moorcock for his valiant efforts in 
the behalf of British science-fiction 
publishing, though which he man- 
aged to keep Britain’s only home- 
grown sf magazine still surviving. 
New Worlds, alive by means of a 
British Arts Council grant. On the 
second day of the convention, Mike 
Moorcock told how he got the grant 
that will help keep that magazine’s 
(mast) head above water. He also 
showed around a dummy of the 
forthcoming first issue in its new 
format. The main theme of Moor- 
cock’s speech, however, was about 
“revolution and evolution in science 
fiction” — that is, the forces and 
people who change the shape of 
science fiction, not the plot-4hemes 
of ev. & rev. 

Moorcock’s example of a revolu- 
tionary force in modern science fic- 
tion is J. G. Ballard. To his way 
of thinking, Ballard is doing some- 
thing entirely new in sL This point 
was challenged by someibody in the 
audience who rebutted Ballard, say- 
ing all he had done was to put a 
few new twists on the old James 
Joyce “stream-of-consciousness” nar- 
rative technique. 

There’s one in eveiy crowd. 

Can't Anyone Help Denmark? 

For contrast, let’s turn from the 
lively state of science fiction and 
fandom in Great Britain to the dole- 
ful state of things in Denmark. 

The land of Hans Christian An- 
derson has one, count ’im, one 
active and go-getting science-fiction 
fan, Jannick Storm. Jaimick is con- 
ducting a virtually single-handed 

73 




fight to get some fannish activity 
going in his country, and he hasn’t 
had much luck. 

Now, Jannick says there are cer- 
tainly enough readers of science 
fiction in Denmark — but where are 
all the fans? Most of the major 
science-fiction writers are translated 
into Danish and published over 
there. Two publishing houses, at 
least, do a thriving business in sf 
— Hasselbalch and Skrifola. Ray 
Bradbury has been represented in 
Denmark by The Martian^ Chronic 
dcs, October Country, The Ulus- 
t rated Man. Poul Anderson’s Brain 
Wave has been done over there, 
and so have books by John Wynd- 
baaTi, Fred Hoyle, Pohl & Kombluth 
aiid most of the classics, such as 
Verne and Wells, Karel Capek and 
Oi'v/ell and Huxley. 

In fact, there are even a couple 
of native Danish science-fiction 
writers around: Niels E. Nielsen and 
Eiler Jorgensen. Harry Harrison has 
translated some of Nielsen’s stuff 
into English, but Jorgensen is un- 
known to me. And there have been 
some homegrown Danish sf antholo- 
gies, published. Jorgen Rothenborg 
did one called The Other Side of The 
Moon, and Tage la Cour edited 
Stories From Other Worlds, and 
tliey were rather good anthologies, 
with stories by Bradbury and Van 
Vogt, Asimov and Stanley G. Wein- 
baum and Katherine McLean and 
other well-known American writers. 

But where in the name of smor- 
gasbord are all the fans? 

Jannick has tried just about every- 
thing. Last year he lectured on 
science fiction to an audience of 



about 18 young readers at a meet- 
ing held in die town of Ringsted, 
Sealand. And he collaborated with 
a small Danish cinema society, or- 
ganizing an open showing of some 
recentish science-fiction movies like 
The Incredible Shrinking Man, The 
Mysterians and Village of the 
Damned. Some 80 people showed 
up, but nothing much seems to have 
happened, fan-wise. 

Jannick Storm went to the Swed- 
ish SF Congress at Malmo, last 
year, hoping that a big event like 
this, held in a nearby country, might 
stimulate the Danish fans into com- 
ing out of hiding. 

Only two fans showed up to rep- 
resent all of Denmark. 

But Jannick isn’t discouraged, and 
the small handfull of sf-minded 
Danes he has managed to either 
discover or convert, may be the 
foundation of a full-fledged local 
fandom in years to come. In the 
meanwhile, I understand he keeps 
in touch with them via correspond- 
ence and encourages them to cor- 
respond with each other by the same 
medium, as they seem to be scat- 
tered too thinly about the country 
for anything like a local fan club. 

I have just heard that this Our 
Man In Fandom column has worked 
up such a storm of interest in 
science fiction and fandom that Don 
Blyly of Peoria has been able to 
found a fanclub of //-readers in his 
local high school, and they’ve just 
started a fanzine called Science Fic~ 
tion Newsletter. Don’s adress is 825 
W. Russell Street, Peoria, Illinois, 
61606. His Newsletter publishes 20 
issues a year and will cost you $2.50 

IF 



74 




if you’d like to subscribe. It main- 
ly consists of book reviews and ar- 
ticles on sf writers like Asimov and 
Zelazny. Our Man In Fandom must 
be pretty popular in Peoria, be- 
cause Don tells me he sold 150 
copies of his second issue! (As far as 
I know, this is the first fanclub and 
the first fanzine that got started 
purely because Our Man In Fandom. 
Any others? Please let me know.) 

Now, if this can happen in Peoria, 
how about Denmark? 1 don’t know 
how many Danish citizens subscribe 
to Worlds of If, but if anyone in 
Denmark is reading this column, 
why not get in touch with Jannick 
Storm and get things going? Jan- 
nick’s address in Ejbyveh 142, Rod- 



ovre, Denmark. Let me know what 
happens — okay? 

At The World Con 

Next time, we’ll take a look at 
what happened over the Labor Day 
weekend at New York City’s Hotel 
Statler-Hilton, where I’ll take you 
on a guided tour of Nycon 3, the 
25th World Science Fiction Con- 
vention. Among Other things, we’ll 
talk about the authors and artists 
and magazines that received the 
1967 Hugos, and we’ll find out 
which city is to be the host for the 
26th World Science Fiction Conven- 
tion in 1968.

T he network of spacolights is 
spread throughout the Galaxy, 
its orbit pacing the stars; it has not 
yet comi^eted one twenty-millionth 
of that orbit. There are holes in it, 
where Galactic Federation has not 
yet reached, but where it is establish-

cant; there is a lot of blackness be- 
yond it, and it is known as “the 
one on the edge of nowhere.” But, 
second only to Base, it contains the 
biggest information bank in the sec- 
tor. From local traffic and the near- 
est station it receives, stores, relays, 
answers five hundred requests during 
every twenty-four So 1 3 / Standard 
hours — requests for maps, co- 
ordinates, medicines, doctors, plas- 
ma, whole blood, ship parts, human- 



77 



body paits, police, repair men, 
prints, data from every branch of 
^ence, art and history — from a 
thousand races; humanoid, arthro- 
pod, arachnid, avian, ichthyoid — 
whatever classification there is. 

And it answers them all, unless 
something goes wrong. 

Five-nincty-nine was invisible in 
the dimlit sky. 

If it could have been seen from 
the supply ship, it would have seem- 
ed a huge black ball like an anarch- 
ist’s bomb, with a complex fuse of 
antennas for radar, maser and radio. 

Bugasz closed with it as if it were 
a bomb. Every once in a while, in a 
tic, he lifted a hand and bit skin 
from the sides of his nails. He was 
a big man with crisp yellow hair 
and a face red and veinwebbed 
from the unshielded glare of a thou- 
sand suns, no-one’s idea of a nervous 
wreck. 

“Take it easy, Bugasz,” Stannard 
said. 

“I can’t. I dunno what’s wrong 
there, and I’m scared.” 

“The signal’s eccentric; that means 
the antenna, and it probably knocked 
out the radio with it. What else can 
be wrong?” 

“Crazy signal, dead radio? What 
else does it have to be?” 

“They could be out checking the 
antenna.” 

“She docs that. He wouldn’t 
know how to go near an antenna. 
He’s a computer man.” 

“Maybe she ran out of oxygen 
and got him to bring her a fresh 
tank. For God’s sake!” 

“They can do that from the in- 
side . why didn’t they use the 



boat’s radio to call 588, at least? 
Not a word!” 

“Look, Bugasz, will you shut up 
already? The Hendrickses can take 
good care of themselves. There’s 
about three hundred yells for help 
backed up in that computer, and 
Base is howling blue blazes. That’s 
what Vm worried about. So call it 
off! Anyway, we’ll be there in fif- 
teen minutes.” 

D r. Ramcharan quietly folded 
and put away the gauzy silk 
square she had been embroideiing 
with gold thread and bent over to 
open her instnunent case and check 
the contents. 

Stannard blinked at her. “Now 
don’t tell me you’ve forgotten some- 
thing.” 

She smiled and said in a gentle 
voice, “I never forget. It is like, you 
say, always with a woman? If I 
sometimes wonder, oh, did I remem- 
ber to turn off all the robots when 
I came from home?” A small beau- 
tiful woman, she had leak-colored 
skin and blueblack hair coiled in a 
knot at the base of her neck. 
Though she wore the ciisp white 
redcrossed surcoat and narrow tious- 
ers of Med/ Tech, there was always 
a small glint of gold about her: in 
the cloth of her inner sleeves, in her 
filigree earrings, her sandals. 

The ship moved gently against 
the spaceli^t; the magnetic grapples 
clamped on its flanks with a reas- 
suring klungf and the entrance shaft 
connected onto the lock with a bare- 
ly perceptible suction thump. Bugasz 
handed out suits. Dr. Ramcharan 
squeezed her sandals into a small 

IF 



78 




chamois bag and hung them around 
her neck. 

Stannard dragged on his suit and 
immediately started to sweat. Li^t 
made him sweat; heat made him 
sweat. He was a middle-sized man 
with thinning brown hair and 
glacier chips for eyes. He did not 
cai'e for the outdoors or convivial 
company or comfortable travel. On 
a ship he was happiest when he was 
looking for the source of the trou- 
ble below decks where the wiring- 
boards were racked. Sometimes he 
whistled to himself a bit in the dark 
pits of orbital stations and space- 
lights, back of the glittering multi- 
eyed panels where the questions 
were asked and answered. Especial- 
ly if there was a good refrigeration 
system cooling the air around him. 
On leave at Base he looked for no 
other society than that of a silent 
embittered old decontamination-man, 
an ex-spaceman, with whom he play- 
ed endless games of go, his only 
recreation. 

He picked up a bag much bigger 
than Dr. Ramcharan’s. “Come on, 
let’s get over. I don’t want to cook 
in this thing.” 

T he locks closed behind them 
and opened before. Their boots 
vibrated silently against their feet 
in the dark cavern of the antecham- 
ber. They stepped before the inner 
door. 

“It’s supposed to light up in here 
when these doors open,” Stannard 
said. 

“Yeah.” They turned questingly 
in a silence broken by the faint 
rustle of static at the earphones* 



Bugasz peered at the fluorescent 
manual-control panel. “That’s fun- 



ny. 



“What? Air’s coming in; gravity’s 



Earth-normal.” 

Bugasz muttered, “I dunno . 

“Try the switches.” 

Bugasz pulled down OPEN, 
LIGHT, ALARM. Nothing happen- 
ed. He plunged them back ;and forth, 
without result. “The grapples work- 
ed, so did the outside door,” Stan- 
nard said, 

“I used the ship’s controls for 
that.” He got out his flash and 
aimed the beam at the contrd panel. 
“Look. There’s a couple scratches 
and dents around the edge there. I 
could see black marks on the fluores- 
cent. There.” He switched the flash 
off and on. “Looks hke it was pried 
off and put back ... I bet the 
wires are ripped behind that 
thing . .” 

Dr. Ramcharan’s breath quicken- 
ed. Stannard felt hairs rising in a 
prickling wave up his legs and back 
and a drench of sweat running down 
to meet it. He squatted and opened 
his bag. “Find me the serial num- 
ber on that panel.” 

“Here — 7X724.” 

“Get the light down here.” He 
pulled out one of a dozen neatly 
racked miniature controlboards, 
pressed a stud, and the out-lock door 
slid open again. “Get back in the 
shaft. I don’t know what’s in there, 
but if it isn’t anything good we’re 
getting out of here fast.” 

They backed away. 

“Ready?” Stannard touched an- 
other stud. 

Thie inner door opened. There 



ROGUE'S GAMBIT 



79 




was a short hallway and yet one 
more door of clear Incite panels be- 
fore them. Light blazed in their faces 
from the room beyond. There was 
nothing in it but a man crumpled 
on the floor and a computer hum- 
ming softly to itself. 

N early twelve hours before, they 
had set out from 601, a much 
bigger spacelight with enough crew 
to maintain a social structure that 
included several families. Stannard 
had (been overseeing the maintenance 
staff on a tricky repair problem; he 
was a travelling trouble-shooter and 
did not live there. News of the ir- 
regular signal and the unanswered 
SOS’s had relayed back to Base on 
a long chain of lights and out again 
to Stannard, along wih microfiles 
on all aspects of 599, including its 
occupants, a married couple. This 
last because Stannard doubled in a 
police capacity — he reported to 
hundreds of GalFed agencies on 
jurisdictional and insurance matters. 
He loathed the extra work; but space 
is vast, and lives by comparison are 
few and short. There was a chronic 
lack of manpower whether it came 
from Sol or Betelgeuse. 

The job involved endless duplica- 
tions of forms he sweated filling out 
under hot lights with a pen gripped 
awkwardly in his wire-threader’s 
fingers. There was rarely any excite- 
ment. Once he had subdued ,a crew- 
man who had gone spacemad and 
was laying about him with a wrench: 
but he never spoke of the incident, 
principally because it made him un- 
easy that a good, level-headed man 
could go wild working in the cool, 



quiet conditions he himself loved so 
welL 

He had taken the risk of delaying 
a couple of hours to send for infor- 
mation about Bugasz, because the 
supply-man was the only person who 
visited 599 regularly and knew it and 
its occupants well. He had been on 
601 when the call came, with his 
ship fuelled and ready about to take 
off for his next stop. He had been 
more than willing to change course 
for 599. 

Stannard had spent a couple of 
hours with the microreader on the 
way out, so he knew the contents 
of the three dossiers. And the sub- 
ject of one of them was lying dead 
on the floor. 

‘That is Cornelius Hendricks, 
isn’t it, and he is dead?” 

Dr. Ramcharan was kneeling be- 
side him. “Very much so, I am 
afraid.” 

O nce they had checked that gravi- 
ty was Earth-normal inside and 
air and temperature were standard, 
Bugasz had ripped off his helmet 
and run throu^ the station yelling, 
“Iris! Iris!” There was no answer, 
and he came back with his shoulders 
sagging, his face both anxious and 
defeated. “She’s not here! Where 
can she be?” 

Stannard muttered, “We’ll find 
her. Don’t worry . .” He was 
looking at the body of Cornelius 
Hendricks. Age fifty-three, a quiet 
solitary, like Stannard, who had mar- 
ried Iris Cullen, a girl in her twen- 
ties, two years before. Now he was 
lying dead, with an empty spray can 
of deadly vermicide in his hand.

IF 




Startnard decided that he was never 
going to make either of those mis- 
takes. “How long?” 

“He is very stiff. Twelve hours, 
perhaps?” 

“That’s five-six hours after the 
signal started going ...” So Hen- 
dricks had been alive when they got 
the news. And he had delayed. But 
nothing would have sav^ Hen- 
dricks; he had sprayed the stuff in- 
to his mouth, and death must have 
come in a few minutes. 

Dr. Ramcharan picked up the can 
by the nozzle. “Excelthion. This kills 
all the vermin in the local sector — 
but I won’t allow it on 601 because 
of the children. You cannot go into 
a room for six hour after you use 
it.” 

“I got some on board,” Bugasz 
said. 

“Get rid of it. There are other 
effective things you can use with 
less trouble.” 

Stannard was thinking of those 
twelve hours. But from 601 to 599 
it took just over twelve hours, and 
there was no shorter way. And he 
was thinking of Dr. Ramcharan. It 
was Bugasz who had suggested she 
come, just as they were leaving; 
she lived on 601, one of a huge team 
of resident spacelight doctors who 
rotated every two years. What kind 
of trouble had be foreseen, that he 
wanted her here? 

Dr. Ramcharan was packing her 
instruments. “Are we to leave him 
here?” 

“Did you get pictures?” 

“Yes.” 

“Wrap him up and we’ll take him 
along.” 



She took a thin transparent plas- 
tic sack out of her bag, unfolded 
it and began pulling it over the 
body. “Did the stuff do that to his 
face?” Stannard asked. 

“Just the purple,” Bugasz said. 
“That’s what his face was like.” 
Even discounting the cyanosed 
skin, the dead man was peculiarly 
ugly. Not in the features themselves, 
but in a certain asymmetry and lack 
of alignment. It was as if a noble 
marble head had been smashed by a 
child and glued together to escape 
detection. One eye, one brow were 
lower than the others, the nose 
twisted, the mouth jagged into a 
sneer. “It doesn’t tell what he was 
like, really,” said Dr. Ramcharan. 
“What was he like, Bugasz?” 

“I didn’t have much to do with 
him. I didn’t know him that well.” 
“Doesn’t look like we will, either,” 
Stannard said. “I better look at the

do you call from here, 588?” 
“Yeah. It’s as far as we can 
get. They relay.” 

' It was a sm^ place, 599, a space- 
light for two. The communications 
room was next door. 

4CT)ugasz!” Stannard yelled. Bu- 
-D gasz came running. “Why 
didn’t you tell me about this?” 

The radio was smashed, staved in, 
a wreck of coils and wires. It look- 
ed as if the madman with the 
monkey wrench had been at it. 
There was in fact a wrench on the 
floor. 

Bugasz gaped. “Honest to God, 
Stannard, I didn’t even see that. All 
I was looking for was her.”

Stannard had bent over to stare 
at la red-lit indicator on a panel 
beside the radio. “The boat’s not in 
dock. It’s gone.” 

“Do you think she — ” 

“How far could she get in that?” 
“Only to 588. But the lock con- 
trols are bust!” 

“Not from the inside. I checked.” 
“I can call 588 from the ship — ” 
“Not yet.” 

“But Stannard — ” 

“She’ll keep, Bugasz! I’m worried 
about the orbit now! All this smash- 
ing, if the pile’s been touched — ” 
“But that’s sealed! Even you 
haven’t got high enough clear- 
ance — ” 

“He did all this. Someone did. If 
he wanted to foul up the pile bad 
enough he could manage that too. 
Let’s look at the antennas.” He 
trotted down the short hallway to 
the antenna-control room. It was a 
small, narrow place with one end 
wall taken up by instruments, and 
the other by a little spiral staircase 
leading to the hatch that gave ac- 
cess to the antennas. The antennas 
themselves folded into recesses with 
translucent walls in the center of the 
spaceiight. Now they were partially 
retracted, the switches jammed. 
“God, what a mess! That louse didn’t 
leave much,” Stannard said. ‘This is 
going to be a hell of a repair job. 
Try the locks . they’re gone too?” 
“You can use the remote to open 
them — ni go out and see what’s 
doing.” 

“No, wait a minute.” He was re- 
luctant to let Bugasz out of his sight. 
Mrs. Hendricks was gone, and so 
was the boat; Bugasz was edgy and 



overeager. He wanted to know if 
these facts were connected. “If she 
did leave the boat, is there any place 
she could have got to besides 588?” 
“Hell, no. This light’s out in the 
butt end of nowhere. Hendricks 
wasn’t any ordinary dispatcher or 
lighthousekeeper. He was a research 
man with special grants. All he want- 
ed was to be alone with his compu- 
ter.” 

“And his wife,” Stannard added, 
startling himself because he hadn’t 
meant to speak. Bugasz hadn’t even 
heard; he was staring up at the an- 
tenna hatch, Stannard si^ed. “Got- 
ta get that machine going, if he 
didn’t bust it too. Come on, let’s un- 
suit, I’m boiling.” 

“I’d like to have a look — ” 
“Leave it lalone! You don’t know 
which way it’ll collapse if you touch 
it. Come on.”

D r. RanKharan was using a small 
pump to extract air from the 
bag before she sealed it. Stannard 
took a last look at the face half 
obscured by plastic folds. “A girl 
twenty-six? Why’d she marry him?” 
“Maybe she thou^ no one else 
would have her,” Bugasz said. 

Stannard took his own and 
Bugasz’s suits and hung them in the 
locker near the doorway. “There’s 
only one suit here. It must be bis. 
Well, doctor, if you’re through with 
that I’ll call the drone.” He used 
one of his control boards; the locks 
opened again, and a small squat 
loading wagon trundled in from the 
ship to pick up the body.

“I’ll wash up now,” Dr. Ram- 
charan said and went off to find 
the bathroom. After a moment she 
came to the doorway and said, 
“Bugasz, there’s a three-d portrait 
here, is it Mrs. Hendricks?” 

“Yes.” He went over, and Stan- 
nard followed him into the bedroom, 
hesitantly crossing the threshold in- 
to privacy. 

The bedroom was spare as a 
monk’s cell, what one would have 
expected of Hendricks. But on a 
small table there was a Incite block, 
measuring perhaps a foot each way, 
and containing a three-dimensional 
portrait photograph, head and shoul- 
ders, of an extremely beautiful 
woman. Her hair was long and so 
fair it was almost white, shading 
deeper into gold nearer the scalp. 
Her features were classic and regu- 
lar, and everything else humanity 
calls beautiful, but the truest beauty 
was in the joyousness and vitality 
of her laughter, even in the frozen 
silence in which it had been pre- 
served. 

Dr. Ramcharan said slowly, “Why 
would she think no one else would 
have her?” 

“That was before,” Bugasz said. 
“She got sick.” 

Stannard said, “I heard of that. 
She dropped out of sight for a cou- 
ple of years, didn’t she? Nobody 
said what it was, though,” 

Bugasz shut his mouth stubbornly 
and turned back into the computer 
room. 

“Not going to get much out of 
him.” Stannard stood looking at it 
a minute, then left the bedroom. 
Past the doorway he stopped dead 



in his (trades. There was no one in 
the computer room. Bugasz was 
gone. 

4 4T) tigasz! Bugasz! Damn the man, 
-D what — ” 

The drone was gone; the ksek 
doors were closed. Stannard had a 
sick glimpse of himself and Dr. Ram- 
charan stranded here without ladio, 
Bugasz flown with the evidence. He 
ran to the locker. Bugasz’s suit was 
still there, but he would not need 
it simply to get into the ship; he 
could risk leaving without it. 

Stannard grabbed his own suit, 
fumbled it on, sealed it, sweating, 
and dragged at the lock contid. al- 
most praying. The door slid aside. 

Bugasz was standing in the shaft, 
the open ship behind him. He w^as 
suitless, weaponless, shamefaced. His 
arms hung at his sides. 

Stannard snarled, “What the hell 
you think you’re doing?” 

“I had to . .” Bugasz mutteicd. 
“I had to radio 588 ... to see if . .” 
“What is it? Hey?” 

Bugasz shook his head and hek- 
ed his lips. “The boat reached 
there . empty. They’re sending it 
back.” 

Stannard looked at him. Bugasz 
swept an arm back toward the shaft 
“It’s the truth. Call them yourself 
if you want.” 

Stannard hesitated a moment and 
said, “I’ll take your word.” 
“Thanks.” 

Anger mounting, Stannard wiench- 
ed at his suit-clamps. “Just don’t, 
Bugasz, don’t try it again!” He was 
humiliatin^y laware of how ludicnous 
he looked when he was angry: red

aidotcbes flecked out on liis white 
skin. “You hear me? Don^ try it!” 
He hung up the suit once more. “We 
stick together till we find out what’s 
up here. You understand?” 

H e turned and stood staring at 
the computer; it hummed, the 
ready light pulsed; the stillness be- 
yond it was heavy. 

“There it is. Everything’s gone 
but that. It’s the only thing that 
didn’t get bashed in. Why?” 

“Maybe it’s booby-trapped.” 

“It’s a nice thought.” 

“Or — he didn’t leave any note 
. maybe he left a message in it.” 
“Yeah.” He went over, reached 
out a hand toward the microphone, 
and let it fall. 

“You scared, Stannard?” 

“What do you think, you fool!” 
Dr. Ramcharan said quickly, 
“Stannard, if you have any doubt, 
seal this place and let us leave. The 
police will take care of it.” 

“Right now Vm the police,” 
Stannard said. “I have to see this 
thing gets working, if I can; I have 
to get that back-up cleared, because 
there’ll be pveople lost or dead; they 
may be already, because he didn’t 
get the stuff out to them.” He wiped 
a hand over his face. “I don’t know 
everything that’s been done here. 
The man was mad. If he’s monkeyed 
with the pile and the orbit’s shifted, 
we may really find out where no- 
where is when making an attempt to 
take off.” 

“If the orbit had changed we’d 
never have got here.” 

“He could have timed it to veer 
off at a certain point. He could have 



booby-trapped it, like you say, or 
even timed it to blow up . , 
“Then why don’t we just — ” 
“Look, you don't imderstand! If 
this place blows up we’re not only 
short one spacelight, we’ll have hot 
asteroids busting out aU over. It’s 
a godawful hazard to anything run- 
ning in this district! Use your head!” 
“I don’t want it blown off!” 
Bugasz yelled. “You’re the police, 
the Tech/ man, the authority — you 
get us out of this!” 

“All right! Take the doctor and 
get on board ship. Take her out a 
thousand miles and pace the light. If 
nothing happens in two hours, you 
can come down with your head in- 
tact. Okay?” 

Dr. Ramcharan said, “Please, 
Stannard, let us not have heroics. If 
we were to blow up, I think we 
would have done so as soon as die 
locks were opened. I don’t think it 
was meant to happen.” 

Stannard considered a moment. 
“Yeah. I guess you’re right.” He 
swallowed, picked up the miCTO- 
phone and said, “Paul Stannard, 
GF/Tech Supervisor, Sector 3284, 
Security clearance B.” 

The machine said, in a machine’s 
voice, “IDENTIFY.” 

Stannard allowed himself one 
breath of relief and pressed his 
■thumb against a small sensitive plate. 
“PROCEED.” 

“What is your orbit, number, 
class, generation?” 

“MY GENERATION IS THIRD; 
MY CLASS IS LV MOD 85; MY 
NUMBER 1526, AND MY ORBIT 
IS THE NINTH CIRCLE OF 
HELL.”

S tannard jerked back; Bugasz 
gulped, and Dr. Ramcharan’s 
breadi shuddered between her teeth. 
The computer s^een flashed to life, 
suddenly, in a flickering pattern of 
concentric circles. 

“What in hell’s going on here?” 
Stannard hung up the microphone 
and stepped back, shivering a little. 
Then he grabbed at it in a fierce 
snatch. “I said, give me your orbit, 
your position!!” 

“THE QUESTION IS ALREADY 
ANSWERED. MY ORBIT IS THE 
NINTH — ” 

“Shut up! Stop!” Stannard knew 
his face by now was brindled as a 
Biblical c^f. He said through his 
teeth, “Ask a stupid question, you 
get a stupid answer.” 

“Stannard — ” Dr. Ramcharan 
hesitated, then and said, “Tell him 
— tell it — is it speaking for Hen- 
dricks, do you think?” 

“Looks like it — I wish I knew 
why. What did you want?” 

“If it is Hendricks, tell him — 
tell him he is not in the Ninth Cir- 
cle, but in Circle Seven, Ring Two.” 
Stannard blinked at her. “Why?” 
“Please. I think it will do no 
harm.” 

Stannard picked up the mike 
slowly and said, “You are in Circle 
Seven, Ring Two, not the Ninth.” 
The machine hummed a moment, 
and said, “I STAND CORRECT- 
ED.” 

Stannard said to the woman, “I 
gather we’re talking about Dante 
and the Inferno^ but I don’t get what 
that was all about.” 

“Circle Seven, Ring Two is 
where the suicides are.” 



Stannard grunted. “That means he 
set all this up before he died. He 
went to a lot of trouble.” 

“He meant to hinder us. This is 
his booby-trap.” 

“Yeah, but why? Breaking every- 
thing I can understand; that’s anger, 
and it took a lot of anger for him 
to kill himself . but this? It’s 
stupid. He didn’t even know . .” He 
had been going to say “us,” but 
stopped. Hendricks had known 
Bugasz. He resisted an impulse to 
turn and look at Bugasz. He didn’t 
want to start another fight. Not 
right now. He spoke into the mi- 
crophone again. “All right. What 
game do you think you’re playing?” 
“WHAT KIND OF GAME DID 
YOU WISH TO PLAY? CHESS? 
GO? TOSS FOR WHITE?” The 
screen swirled into the image of a 
coin, spinning dizzily. 

Stannard hung up in disgust. 
Bugasz muttered, “He was a com- 
puter nut.” 

“I gathered that.” He tried again. 
“Does your memory contain the co- 
ordinates of the present orbit of 
599?” 

“YES.” 

“What is the orbit?” 
“CORRECTED ORBIT: CIRCLE 
SEVEN, RING TWO.” 

“Forget the theology. I am not 
concerned with the orbit of Cor- 
nelius Hendricks but of 599.” 

“NO INFORMATION AVAIL- 
ABLE.” 

“But is the information contained 
in the memory store?” 

“YES.” 

“Good. Do you have a protect on 
that information?” 



ROGUE'S GAMBIT

“YES.” 

“I S32. Is that information avail- 
able with the use of a code-word?” 

“YES.” 

“Hah. I’m just one rung too low 
to clear the code by priority. Let’s 
sec, signal started going eccentric be- 
tween twenty and twenty-two hours 
. were all requests answered 
ajid dispatched up to day 226, hour 
twenty ?” 

“ALL REQUESTS ANSWERED 
AND DISPATCHED UNTIL DAY 
226, HOUR SIXTEEN.” 

“He must have been doing a lot 
of sitoing around brooding . were 
no questions answered at all after 
hour twenty?” 

“QUESTIONS ANSWERED, 
BUT NOT DISPATCHED UNTIL 
HOUR TWENTY.” 

“I guess he started laying about 
then. That means nothing’s been 
coming in since twenty hours, if the 
radio wasn’t working. All right, give 
me a printout of all requests and 
answers between hours sixteen and 
tjweaty.” 

“REQUESTS ARE AVAILABLE; 
ANSWERS ARE NOT.” 

“Hm, we could have been sending 
the stuff out by ship radio . that 
guy really knew how to hold 
a grudge. Tell me, are the answers 
tied to the code-word?” 

“YES.” 

“Give me a memory map.” 

T he map spread itself out on the 
>ereen, beautifully marked and 
spaced. He searched it. There was 
one huge area of blank spaces, with 
no indication of what was stored in 
it, no hint to allow him access. And 



he was afraid to tamper with it. 

“That does it, Hendricks was the 
only one who would have known 
the code-word, and Hendricks is 
dead.” He bit his lip. “Damn, there 
must be something we can do . 
give ime hard copy on your undis- 
patched questions. At least I’ll know 
what’s been going on.” 

The printer started racketa-tacket- 
ing, and a tongue of paper began to 
extrude from the slot. Stannard 
switched on the monitor-recorder, 
and the transcoded voices whispered 
across space: 

Urgent alert GalFedPol SOO kilos

“They’d be landed by the time 
we got that one out.”

Dr. Ramcharan shivered, and they 
were silent 

Kaghouro Clearing Company an- 
nounces completion of program as

Stannard groaned to himself. The 
careful phrases meant that after nine 
years of laboring the Kaghouri had 
finally composed a program to trans- 
late the language of the alien raiders 
who had been stripping them for 
twenty-five years; there would be 
plenty for GalFed to do about that. 
He couldn’t even mention it to the 
others because it was highly classi- 
fied, and he was the police, the 
Security man or what passed for one 
. and the answers were sitting 
there in the machine. He tore off the 
printout and scanned it. He couldn’t 
read the encoded program, but he

knew something of what it involved: 
thousands of lives, uncounted wealth, 
millions of hours of desperate, 
patient drudgery. He could feel his 
whole skin twitching at the thought, 
and he had to keep his mouth shut. 
And he had to have the code. 

He started when Bugasz asked, 
“Why all this fancy business with 
code-words?” 

“That I don’t know, but he could 
have erased the whole thing, answers, 
orbit and all . he could have 
done a dozen different things to de- 
stroy us if he’d wanted, but he didn’t. 
Dr. Ramcharan was right — that 
wasn’t the idea. But there’s some- 
thing else behind this, and I’d sure 
like to know what it is.” 

“What are you going to do for 
us now, Stannard?” 

“1 think it’s a matter of what 
you’re going to do, Bugasz. You 
knew the man, at least to some ex- 
tent. What do you think he’d have 
chosen for a code-word?” 

“You crazy? What do I know 
about computers?” 

“You knew a computer nut. Did 
he have any favorite expressions or 
mottoes?” 

“None I ever heard. He was so 
closemouthed I never even heard him 
say gee whiz.” 

“I need that thing. We’ve got to 
get past this .... maybe we can 
work around him, try another sub- 
ject . .” 

“Ask him where Iris Hendricks 
is, for a start. I’d like to know that.” 
“Fat lot that’s — I guess it won’t 
hurt to try.” He raised the mike. 
“Where is Iris Hendricks?” 

“IRIS HENDRICKS IS WHERE 



IRIS HENDRICKS SHOULD BE.” 

Bugasz whispered, “I don’t like 
that.” 

“I’m not loo keen on it mysdf. 
Fifteen/twentysix, is Iris Hendricks 
alive?” 

“IRIS HENDRICKS WAS 
ALIVE WHEN LAST SEEN BY 
CORNELIUS HENDRICKS.” 

“Is Iris Hendricks now alive?” 
Stannard pressed. 

The machine blared, “FAIIH- 
LESS, FAITHLESS, FAITHLESS

stars of pain. Pause, click, whir. “NO 
INFORMATION ON THAT SUB- 
JECT.” 

T he three of them looked at one 
another. Stannard said again, 
urgently, “Is Iris Hendricks still 
alive?” 

“NO INFORMATION ON THAT 
SUBJECT.” 

“What happened there?” 

“I’m not sure. I think it’s seme 
kind of automatic switchoff . I’m 
scared to monkey around with any- 
thing, because I don’t know how he’s 
got it set up here, and I might wipe 
off something we need.” He stared 
at the humming mass for ,a nK>ment, 
thinking of the Kaghouri waiting for 
the results of their nine years’ ef- 
fort. “Maybe . His fingers tight- 
ened on the mike. He said in a rea-

of tension, “Paul Staimard, GF/

“Cross your fingers.”

“What is your number, class,

“MY GENERATION IS THIRD,

“Fifteen-twentysix, will you play

“CERTAINLY. WHAT KIND

on the screen. 

“Go,” said Stannard. 

Bugasz snarled, “Stannard, what 
do you think you’re doing?” 

“Playing go.” 

Bugasz glared at him, and Dr. 
Ramcharan said with a touch of dry- 
ness, “I didn’t know you played 
games, Stannard.” 

“It’s the only one I know,” said 
Stannard, and he addressed the ma- 
chine: “I’ll take a white.” 

“YOU ARE THE PAUL STAN-

GZX OF EUROPA AT THE PAN-

“Yes ” 

“I AM NOT PROGRAMMED

Stannard grunted. “Done his

ed to the others. “I wanted to get 
back my access to the memory store, 
or the part of it we were dealing 
with when it cut off. The part he 
kept for himself, to play around 
with. This was the only way I could 
think of to do it. This part . 
looks like he implanted a bit of his 
personality into it some way . 
it’s not uncommon, I guess, with 
people who love computers . 



“Do you do that, Stannard?” the 
woman asked. 

“It’s not one of my games.” 

Ill 

B ugasz moved restlessly. “What’s 
that got to do with the orbit, 
or where Mrs. Hendricks is?” 

“Mrs. Hendricks certainly has to 
be tied in with his personal life — 
and the rest is, in some way, too. 
I’m sure of it. I know we won’t 
get the orbit till we find out how. 
Now ... if you have any better 
ideas, spit them out.” 

“The machine won’t play,” said 
Dr. Ramcharan. 

“That doesn’t matter. It was wip- 
ing to talk about playing, and that 
was all I needed to get back to where 
I wanted to be.” He went back to 
the microphone. “Do you have in- 
formation on Iris Hendricks?” 

“YOU WISH VITAL STATIS- 
TICS?” 

“I guess so.” 

“CLARIFY.” 

“Yes, go ahead.” A picture of 
Iris Hendricks flashed on the 
screen, and he waited glumly while 
the machine reeled off everything 
he already knew. When it stopped, 
he asked, “Can you tell me where 
she is now?” 

“LAST SEE LEAVING 599, NO 
DEFINITE INFORMATION ON 
PRESENT WHEREABOUTS.” 

“I think this thing’s waffling.” 

Dr. Ramcharan said, “You may 
find out something if you ask about

“I’ll try it — but we’ll have to

“Yeah, I — I mean, go ahead.”

and the madiine began, “CORNE-

“Hey, wait a minute!” Stannard 
yelled. “Who’s that guy in the pic- 
ture supposed to be?” 

“THAT IS A REPRESENTA- 
TION OF CORNELIUS HEN- 
DRICKS.” 

Regular handsome features? Firm 
clean jawline? Perfectly arched 
brows? 

“The hell you say! That’s not 
Hendricks!” 

“Yes it is,” Dr. Ramcharan said 
softly. “It is.” 

It wasn’t, and it was. Each brow, 
each half of the mouth, each eye 
belonged to Hendricks. To the hand- 
some man he would have been if his 
well shaped but badly arranged fea- 
tures had been squared off and sym- 
meti'ical. “It’s the way he wanted to 
think of himself,” she said. 

Stannard sighed. “Yeah ... I 
guess so . He remembered the 
dead empurpled face and set it be- 
side the vital Greek ideal. 

“How’d he do it?” Bugasz asked. 

“Oh . probably fed the ma- 
chine a picture of himself and told 
it to beautify or dc-uglify or sym- 
metrize him or something.” 

Dr. Ramcharan said, “You think 
it is disgusting.” 

Stannard shrugged uncomfortably. 
“I dunno . something .

“Yeah,” Stannard said. “Better

machine again. “Did Hendricks say 
he was going to kill himself?” 
“YES.” 

“Why?” 

“CLARIFY.” 

“All right. Why did he kill him- 
self?” 

There was a blank hum for a mo- 
ment, and the wait was long. The 
machine said with a subtle but defi- 
nite change of intonation, “BE- 
CAUSE I WAS BETRAYED.” 

T he others moved away a little, 
and Stannard broke into an- 
other sweat. He swore to himself. 
Hendricks, damned fool, tangling 
himself up with his machine. People 
crying out of space for help. I, I, I. 
Hendricks, the I, was dead. Hen-

twisting his absurd obscene passion 
for ,a beautiful young woman into 
the clean skeins of wires and transis- 
tors that belonged to Stannard. And 
to the urgencies of a thousand races. 
“Who betrayed you?” he asked. 

The machine said in its curi- 
ous stilted voice, “MY WIFE

It was out, what he had been 
waiting for. The explanation for all 
of Bugasz’s moods, nerves, surliness. 
The missing piece that fit only to 
add greater complexities.

“PLOTTING, PLOTTING, THEY

waited for the sudden shift of the 
cut-off, hut there was none, only 
the silence around the hum. He 
hung up and turned to Bugasz. 

“You have anything to say?”" 

Bugasz was almost speechless. 
“Say?” His face was magenta, his 
voice strangled in his throat. “You 
think that mad fool is telling the 
ti’uth?” 

“I’d say . he’s telling some 
kind of truth — what it looks like 
to him. I know he was nuts. I can’t 
take his word. But you’ve been a 
moss of nerves; you been running 
ajwnd yelling for Iris Hendricks

“Say? What can I say when Vm

Stannard turned back to the mike. 
“How were they plotting? What did 
they intend to do?” 

“THEY WERE GOING TO 
LEAVE ME . WITH NOTHING 
TO DO BUT KILL MYSELF, BE- 
CAUSE SHE WAS ALL MY LIFE. 
NOW THEY ARE GONE, AND 
THERE IS NOTHING TO DO BUT 
DIE.” 

“Bugasz is here,” Stannard said 
dryly. 

“STATEMENT INCOMPRE- 
HENSIBLE.” 



“Here, Bugasz, speak for your- 
self.” 

Bugasz grabbed the mike and 
yelled, “Hendricks, you goddamn 
liar — ” 

••IDENTIFY.” 

Bugasz’s lip curled, but he con- 
trolled himself long enough to 
answer, “Laszlo Bugasz, Supply 
Agent 72. Sector 3284, Security 
clearance C3,” and jabbed the plate 
with his thumb as if he were gouging 
an eye. 

T he machine stammered, “BU- 
GASZ? BUGASZ? NO, NO, 
NOT COMPREHENSIBLE, NO 
ANSWER POSSIBLE, DATA ARE 
NOT, NOT, NOT, N . .” The 
screen flickered with a thousand mad 
images, blanked, and finally, “DO 
YOU WISH TO PLAY A GAME?” 
the co-in spun. 

“Hang up,” Stannard said. “I 
don’t think we better try anything 
else for a while.” 

“Stannard — ” Bugasz choked. 
“You really believe that — that — ” 
Stannard found a chair, sat on it 
and let his hands drop between his 
knees. Dr. Ramcharan gave him a 
long look and said gently, “Bugasz, 

I think he would like to know what 
was between you and Mrs. Hen- 
dricks.” 

“Nothing.” 

Stannard raised his head. 

“I’m not lying. I haven’t even 
spoken to her since I started servic- 
ing this light.” 

“Then where the hell’d he get all 
his crazy ideas? Tell me that?” 
Bugasz shook his head. “I don’t 
know.”

“But you knew iher before, back 
on Base! Well enough to call her by 
her first name — ” 

“All right! But that was back on 
Base. This is different!” 

“Whatever it was, it was enough 
to send Hendricks off his nut. What 
happened back ithere, then?” 

Bugasz sat down. “I did love her, 
once.” 

“Once! It looks like that’s all Hen- 
dricks needed!” 

The red-veined face twisted. “I 
wasn’t in love with her, you fool! 
I loved her. Everybody did. You 
saw what she looked like.” 

“But you knew her very well — ” 
“You saw the dossier. She was in 
starship communications, and I’d 
just joined up with GalFed ... we 
took a couple of courses together 
in emergency procedures, shipboard 
stuff.” 

“Shipboard stuff? And she came 
here?” 

“She’d been going out to Tau 
Ceti — before she got sick.” 

“Go on.” 

“With what?” Bugasz shrugged. 
“She married Hendricks and came 
out here.” 

“And stopping here every two 
months, you never saw her? Not 
once?” 

“A blink of her, going round a 
corner. That’s all.” 

“Hendricks wouldn’t let you . .” 
“He had nothing to do with that.” 
“But you said you’d loved 
her . .” he swallowed. “Didn’t you 
even take her out, ask her to marry 
you, anything?” 

“You kidding? She had all those 
young guys hot out of the academies 



crowding around her; she was hav- 
ing a good time. Look at me,” he 
slapped his chest. “What would she 
want with me? My big dumb head? 
My ugly red face? My pilot’s pay? I 
was ten years older, I had no fu- 
ture . .” 

“And Hendricks made all this mess 
out of that? Come on, Bugasz! And 
if age mattered, Hendricks was twice 
her age.” 

“That was after she got sick.” 

“So she was sick. But she got 
better. What’s that got to do with 
all this?” 

Bugasz sighed and shook his head. 
“She didn’t get better. She had 
Schoebl’s disease.” 

“I never heard of it.” 

“It didn’t have a name when she 
got it. And they kept it off the rec- 
ords as much as they could. Just 
said ‘unspecified disease’ without 
even a description.” 

“Why?” 

“It’s — it’s a horrible, godawful 
— if it leaked out they’d have had 
a panic blowup and maybe have had 
to close down half the lights in the 
sector.” 

“But you knew — with your se- 
curity rating?” 

“I knew. I used to have lunch 
with her about once a week. One 
day she didn’t turn up, so I asked 
around for her and got all kinds of 
dumb excuses . maybe they 
thought I was a deadhead, but a 
supply man gets to know all kinds 
of people, all kinds of things. So I 
found out.” 

S tannard crossed his arms. “Bu- 
gasz this sounds like a lot of — ”

Dr, Ramdiaran interrupted, “I 
know of SchoebL An alien-para- 
sitologist I studied from one of his 
texts, but I never knew he had a 
disease named after him.” 

“You’ll hear about it. They named 
it after him because he isolated the 
parasite and found a cure — three 
weeks ago. This doctor, a young guy 
who told me about it first, back then 
on Base, well he got kicked out for 
shooting his mouth off — not about 
this, just generally; and he was sent 
out to the sticks. I ran into him, 
and he tipped me off they had a 
cure ... a couple weeks ago. Still 
shooting his mouth off, I guess.” 

“It sounds plausible,” Dr. Ram- 
charan said. 

“It would if we knew who this 
guy was.” 

“You’re not gonna, I don’t want 
to get him bumped again.” 

“What kind of disease was it, 
Bugasz?” she asked. 

“You know that tropical Earth 
disease, something about an ele- 
phant?” 

“Elephantiasis?” 

“Yeah. The one where you swell 
up in the feet, and — ” 

“Yes. That is also a parasite. 
Filaria. It blocks the lymph glands, 
sometimes causes lumps under the 
skin . .” 

“But that’s mostly the feet, or . .” 
he rubbed his forehead. “This one 
— this one you can get anywhere 
. shoulder, hand, lips, cheeks, 
nose . His face screwed up like 
a child’s who was about to cry. “I 
saw her ... I got in and saw her.” 

“Your blabbermouth doctor 
friend,” Stannard said. 



“Yeah. But nobody saw her after 
that. She didn’t want people to . .” 
Dr. Ramcharan said, “I believe 
the disease exists. I heard rumors 
of it, but it had no name then.” 
“It’s got one now. Schoebl’s dis- 
ease. They caught three cases of it 
on Base, altogether, and isolated 
them before it got around; but they 
didn’t know what it was.” 

“You went to see her — you 
might have caught it.” 

“It stops spreading when the 
nodes ripen. I didn’t know that then. 
But I saw her.” He put his head in 
his hands. 

“But Hendricks never kept you 
away from her when you dropi>ed 
off supplies,” Stannard said. 

“No, but she wouldn’t look at 
anybody. She — ” 

“Bugasz! Did you know you had 
two unauthoriz^ visits marked 
down on your record in the last two 
weeks?” 

Bugasz jerked up. “Hendricks!” 
he snarled. “He said he’d tell on 
me, that louse!” He slumped again. 
“There’s my job.” 

“So you’ve been lying all along.” 
“Damn you, I never lied! Not 
once!” 

IV 

S tannard poured a sweat of fury 
and impatience and frustration. 
“Then why were you out here!” 

“I wanted to tell him, for God’s 
sake! Can’t you understand? I want- 
ed to tell him she could be cured! 
He wouldn’t even let me in. I 
thought, so help me God, I thought 
he’d be glad; I thought he’d be

jumping up and down dheering his 
head off! He wouldn’t even let me 
ini 1 had to talk to him on the 
radio. I was ydling at him — ” 
Bugasz held his hands before him, 
stretched and trembling, “yelling at 
him, ‘Hendricks, I only want to tell 
you they got a cure for the damn 
thing; it’s Schoebl’s disease, some 
kind of bug, if you’ll only take her 
into Base they can — his hands 
fell to his knees. “He cut me off. I 
couldn’t even get him to talk to 
me. I came back a week later and 
tried again, and he said he’d report 
me. That’s it.” 

“This cure could be only a ru- 
mor.” 

“No. I checked with another guy 
I know. It’s classified, but it’s no 
rumor.” 

“Huh. I didn’t know Security was 
that full of holes.” 

“I wouldn’t tell you if my job 
wasn’t shot.” 

“This makes everything even more 
complicated.” 

“No, Stannard . .” Dr. Ramcha- 
ran shook her head sadly. “That poor 
man . you remember, he took 
her when she was hideous. He was 
ugly; perhaps there was no one else 
in the world, he thought, who would 
have him . such a man would be 
an ugly person inside, too, I think ?’* 
She looked at the blank screen where 
the picture had flashed Hendricks’s 
idealization. “Or too shy and self- 
conscious . or he would see that 
ugly people also live and are loved 
in the world. It was his mistake that 
he took her because she had been 
beautiful. But he took her, and she 
was grateful, and perhaps even loved 



him for it . .” She ran her eyea 
over the plated walls. “You have 
this garden, a place for two, like in 
the silly songs, only lined in steeL 
And then Bugasz, the outside 
world, comes pounding on the door 
with the news that she will be beauti- 
ful again, with a miraculous cure, 
like being freed from an evil spell — 
and he is only an ugly man. Would 
she look at him after that? And as 
an irrational man, would he not be 
angry at Bugasz and do his best to 
strike back?” 

“He might,” said Stannard. “And 
Bugasz could have explained some 
of this before, too.” 

“How could I? He swore he’d 
have my job. There’s nothing in the 
universe I’m fit for except shoving 
this old scow back and forth, and 
now I haven’t even got that. rU end 
up in decontamination spraying Ex- 
celthion on Schoebl’s bugs, and if 
there’s a leak in the dickey-suit HI 
get my lungs burnt out like Hen- 
dricks got his.” 

44X^eah, it’s sad,” Stannard said 
X and watched Bugasz stiffen. 
“If all this is true, if there is such a 
disease, if she had it, if Schoebl 
found a cure for it, why in hell did 
you come out here if you knew it 
meant your job? Whatever it was, 
something about your coming out 
here triggered him. Why didn’t you 
just sit tight and wait and let the 
news of the cure leak out, through 
the news reports? Having radio con- 
tact, he couldn’t have missed them. 
Even if he was such a hermit and 
didn’t listen to news, the Base hos- 
pital, knowing her case, would have

gotten in touch with him. He 
couldn’t’ have avoided it. And then 
he’d have had to do ^mething, prob- 
ably something constructive because 
he’d have gotten a slow solid push 
— he couldn’t have ducked out; 
he’d have been ashamed. But he 
wouldn’t have flung himself around 
and smashed everything up.” 

“I know it was dumb.” Bugasz 
cracked his knuckles. “I didn’t want 
him to — I didn’t do it to make 
him act like that. I didn’t know it 
would happen . .” 

“You were the one who wanted 
Dr. Ramcharan to come.” 

“Sure, I figured if there was some- 
thing wrong with the antenna, he’d 
have to let us in — and if I had a 
doctor with me I could force him to 
let her examine Iris and maybe 
make a case out of treating her. I 
didn’t know my coming here before 
would have started — ” He moved 
his hands helplessly. 

“Then why — ” 

“Give me a minute, for God’s 
sake! It’s hard to say this.” He 
fumbled in Ms pockets for a pack of 
(thin cigars land lit one. “I could 
have married her, after she got sick. 
She would have had me. I’m better 
looking than Hendricks, anyway, 
and younger. Women don’t scrunch 
their faces up when they look at me, 
and I’ve had what I wanted — all 
except her. She’d have come to love 
me, and I’d have loved her, because 
there was nothing twisted about her, 
inside. But I got in to see her . 
and they hadn’t even let her have a 
mirror — and — and she looked at 
me, and — the look in my eyes told 
her what the thing had done.

IF 





looked her right in the face, 
and he married her. I could have 
had faith a cure’d be found ... it 
was a parasite, not a thing like can- 
cer. Cures for this kind of thing 
turn up fast enough when they’re 
needed as much las this one was.” 

“You cannot blame yourself for 
choosing not to marry an ugly 
woman,” Dr. Ramcharan said. “It 
has happened a few times before. 

“But he gave her his love and a 
marriage . all I gave her was 
the sick look in my eyes that told 
her for the first time what a horri- 
ble, godawful thing she’d turned in- 
to.” He raised his head. “That’s 
why I came out. I wanted to be the 
one to give her the news, like giving 
her back her beauty . because I 
felt I was the one who took it away. 
I wanted to make up . 



“But she’s gone,” Stannard said. 
“Even granting Hendricks was nuts, 
and I grant it willingly, there’s 
nothing to prove you didn’t lift her 
off this place and leave her some- 
where, having a good idea what Hen- 
dricks would do, and then come back 
with us, all innocent, bringing Dr. 
Ramcharan so she could testify he 
killed himself. You could even have 
smashed the radio yourself, so he 
couldn’t send out a call and head 
you off. You could have dispatched 
the boat to 588 so he couldn’t get 
out of here and have ripped off the 
outside controls — or even rigged 
the antennas so we couldn’t reach 
here very easily. 

“And there’s nothing to prove 
Mrs. Hendricks was deformed, even 
if she did have something wrong 
with her at one time. You may not

have known Hendricks very well, 
but you knew enough of him to pre- 
dict Ihe might just kill himself if you 
were trying to take his wife away 
from him or if he thought you 
were . why didn’t you blow up 
the pile already, Bugasz? Then there 
would have been no evidence at all.” 

C 4 "\rou crazy fool!” Bugasz hurl- 
I ed his cigar at the wall and 
screamed, “That’s what .that louse 
wants you to think! You’re playing 
right into his hands!” 

“Maybe I am.” Stannard turned 
to the humming machine. “But I 
don’t trust that thing any more. 
Whatever kind of nut Hendricks was, 
he made his biggest mistake when he 
got that computer tangled up with 
his feelings. I’m going to shut this 
whole operation down and take you 
with me to Base. Let those poor 
fools out there answer their own 
questions — it’s better than having 
them trust people like you and Hen- 
dricks. And we’ll take the tapes and 
recordings and let the police listen 
to them and ask you their questions 
and knock their heads over what to 
do about the whole thing. I don’t 
want to touch it any more. I’m 
tired.” 

“Stannard, if you do that we’ll 
never find her! Stannard! She’ll stay 
lost somewhere out here. I don’t 
know where she is, I swear! I haven’t 
done any of the things you think. 
And I haven’t touched this machine, 
you know I have C3 clearance — 
it’d shut off, I couldn’t get near it. 
I couldn’t have gotten near the pile 
even if I’d wanted to; I couldn’t 
have monkeyed with the orbit — 



I’m a pilot, and all I can do with 
machinery is pull switches — maybe 
I can tighten ,a screw, but even then 
I wreck the thread.” He slapped the 
console. “Hendricks set things up to 
make this happen — it’s the way he 
figured he’d get even. Stannard!” he 
begged. “Please! Ask him! Ask him 
if she had Schoebl’s disease. It’s the 
only way I can think of that’U prove 
I told you the truth.” 

“Why should he have put that in?” 
“I don’t know! Chances are he 
didn’t, and it’s just one more damn 
dumb idea — but I’m willing to 
take even a one-in-a-million chance. 
Please!” 

Stannard regarded the machine 
with loathing. Madness in its twist- 
ed wires. He got up slowly, his 
shoulders weary. He went over and 
picked up the microphone. “More 
damn idiotic . Hendricks — ” 
The screen stayed blank. “NO 
DATA, NO DATA, NO DATA — ” 
“Stop.” He swabbed his forehead. 
“I don’t know if I can get anything 
out of this thing now . He be- 
gan wearily for the last time, “Paul 
Stannard, GF/Tech Supervisor ...” 
and went through the rigmarole. 
“No, I do not want to play a game. 
I want to know if Cornelius Hen- 
dricks knew that his wife had 
Schoebl’s disease.” 

“I READ YOU, TECH/ MAN. 
THE PROTECT IS DISSOLVED. 
ALL DATA ARE NOW ACCESSI- 
BLE.” 

T hey stared at it in silence for a 
full minute, and Stannard whis- 
pered, “Is SchoehVs disease the 
code-word?” 



96 



IF 




“YES.” 

Taldng no chances, Stannard 
grabbed his bag and pulled out his 
own recorder. “Give me the orbit! 
Gimme the stores!” 

Bugasz yelled, “Ask him where 
Iris is, goddamnnit, ask him!” 

“AH right, give me a minute! 
Now, Hendricks, you damn well 
better tell me where your wife is!” 
The screen flashed in mad suc- 
cession with the picture of Iris, the 
reconstructed image of Hendricks, 
the go-board, the spinning coin, the 
concentric circles, a nebula, a map 
oi the spacelight network, the 
memory-map — now filled, an un- 
specified flow-diagram, a monster — 
real or imagined — a hideous cari- 
cature of Hendricks’s actual face. 

The sound rose blaring till the 
metal voice rebounded endlessly 
from the steel walls. 

“DEAD, DEAD, DEAD, YOU 
FOOL! UNDER THE ANTEN- 
NA! DEAD! NOBODY WILL 
HAVE HER! NOBODY!” The 
voice died abruptly into a wail. “OH 
IRIS IRIS IRIS, I DIDN’T MEAN 
IT, IRIS, FORGIVE ME, IRIS I 
DIDN’T MEAN IT — IRIS IRIS 
IRIS IRIS . .” 

On and on and on — but Bugasz, 
with a cougar’s ripple of movement, 
had slid into his suit, grabbed Stan- 
nard’s Gag, and was racing for the 
antenna room before Stannard could 
as much as turn around and blink. 

The machine went on, “IRIS 
IRIS IRIS — ” but Stannard made 
no move to shut it up. He stood 
v/aiting till a few minutes later when 
Bugasz came back, carrying the 
v/oman’s limp body. He took her in- 



to the bedroom and laid her gently 
on the bed. Dr. Ramcharan was in 
there already, and Stannard came 
after. 

She started to undo the spacesuit, 
but as they moved closer, she said, 
“Please don’t look.” 

Stannard went back to where the 
machine was still wailing. Bugasz 
knocked back his helmet and ran 
after him, twitching him round by 
a push at the shoulder. He roared, 
“You! You wouldn’t let me check 
the antennas!” and swung a back- 
hand blow to the side of the head 
that sent Stannard flying. 

“IRIS IRIS IRIS — ” 

After a moment, Stannard 
dragged himself up, staggered over, 
pulled down the mike. “Stop it,” he 
said. “You can stop now. She’s 
alive.” 

V 

S tannard ran diagnostic tests and 
satisfied himself that fifteen/ 
twenty-six was no longer a jealous 
liar. There was nothing wremg with 
the orbit; the answers for hours six- 
teen to twenty were there for the 
picking. And Iris Hendricks was 
alive, but only just. In gasping 
whispers she was able to add the 
few details they needed to know. 
Hendricks had sent her out to check 
the antennas and simply retracted 
them. Although they moved very 
slowly, not in one quick collapse, 
there was no way for her to escape. 
The hatches were locked, and she 
couldn’t dodge out of the way with- 
out ripping her air-hose; she had no 
oxygen tanks. She had been carrying 



ROGUE'S GAMBIT 



97 




a heavy lantern; all she coidid do 
was jam it under the an^e of one 
of the descending aims and lie 
trapped in the narrow space it left 
her. She had lain there eighteen 
hours. “I thought it was a mistake 
at first — I was going to call him 
through the suit-radio . but he 
started screaming things — he 
thought I was dead — and — and 

5 > 

Dr. Ramcharan drugged her into 
relieved sleep, and Bugasz called in 
the drone. 

“Will she live?” Stanhard asked. 
“Oh, yes. She would have weak- 
ened and died soon if we had not 
found her, but now she is only 
bruised.” She turned to Bugasz. 
“How will they cure her?” 

“The way I heard it, there’s drugs 
to kill the parasites and dissolve die 
nodes. Some of them will probably 
have to be cut out. She won’t be — 
everyittung she was, but . .” he 
watched the drone trundling toward 
the shaft with its burden, and Dr. 
Ramcharan gave her attention to 
Stannard’s battered cheekbone and 
the cut on the comer of his mouth. 

“You are determined to stay?” 
Stannard winced a little at her 
touch. “It is not good for men to be 
alone in these places.” 

“The police will be here within 
a day, and I can clear things up 
faster. I’m not a lonely type. Be- 
sides, I won’t even be ;alone.” He 
cocked his head at the machine, and 
grimaced. “I’ve got him.” 

Bugasz tore his eyes away from 
the disappearing drone, came over 
to Stannard and gave a couple of 
preliminary swallows. “I’m sorry.” 



Stannard, bruised, thin-haired and 
cold-eyed, feeling a little sorry for 
himself and ridiculing himself for 
it, looked up at Bugasz and took 
one small flicker of enjoyment from 
the big man’s humility. “Forget it.” 

B ugasz, with a slumping of the 
shoulders, went into the ship. 
“The poor man will lose his job,” 
Dr. Ramcharan said. 

Stamiard said, “Not through me. 
I’ll do my best to help him keep it. 
But he took a swing at me, and l”m 
not gonna let him off the hook.” He 
grinned at the expression on her face, 
even though it hurt his mouth. 
“You’ll tell him, anyway, as soon 
as you get on board.” 

“You are hard on the feelings of 
a person, Stannard.” 

“I’m a Tech /man. I never wanted 
to be a policeman.” 

She took his chin in her hand 
and looked down so there was no 
escaping her eyes. The shadow of 
her sleeve glittered with gold, and 
her fingers laced his jaw like hot 
gold wire. “You are not lonely and 
you do not need to be loved. I think 
someone forgot to teach you bow.” 
He sat unmoving, hands resting on 
bis knees. “Are you lonely, Dr. 
Ramcharan?” 

“My husband is treating tentacle 
paralysis on Barnard IX, and my 
children are home in New Bombay 
with my mother. But I will have a 
sabbatical soon, and I hope to see 
(them ,all.” 

“Good luck,” he said. 

She packed her bag quietly and 
left, going down the shaft with the 
slipping glide of a woman who has 

IF 



98 




learned to keep a sari from sliding 
off her shoulder. 

The locks closed. 

S tannard called for a tape print- 
out of the Kaghouri data first 
and then for the rest of the answers, 
it would save time ifor the police, 
and he would have at least one 
neat package to hand over to them. 
Then he turned down the thermo- 
stat, dimmed the lights and sat down 
and lit a cigarette. He began to shape 
in his mind the explanations he 
would have to lay out; but there 
was plenty of time for that, and he 
left it. He meditated briefly on the 
complexities of men and the ma- 
chines that served them. His 
thoughts, his eyes, drifted back to 
the computer. He sighed. 

Part of Hendricks’ tormented 
spirit was still twined in its guts. 
The man had had no right to do 
that, to force his machine to lie, de- 
ceive, conceal, accuse • . but it had 



been done. The Psych /police would 
unreel the situation hour by hour 
from its stores, would report, judge 
and close the case. Still unresolved 
forever because a machine may not 
expiate nor a man absolve it. 

He got up very slowly, went over 
and picked up the mike. 

“Fifteen/ twenty-six, this is Stan- 
nard again . will you play a game 
of go with me?” 

“I AM NOT PROGRAMMED 
TO PLAY WITH A FIFTH-CLASS 
PLAYER.” 

“That’s all right,” he said. “I’ll 
take white and give you a four-stone 
handicap. It’ll even us out okay . .” 

He waited, almost tensely, and 
after a moment the go-board ap- 
peared, white-hatched against gray, 
black-dotted at the D and Q ccoss- 
points of 4 and 16. 

“Fine.” He took a deep breath. 
“My first move is R 14 . .”

it charm the strange berserkers of Hell? 



F orcing the passage through the 
dark nebula Taynarus cost the 
humans three fighting ships, and 
after that they took the casualties 
of a three-day battle as their board- 
ing parties fought their way into 
Hell. 

The Battle Commander of the 
task force feared from the begin- 
ning to the end of the action that 
the computer in command on the 
berserker side would destroy the 
place and the living invaders with 
it, in a last Gotterdammerung of 
destructor charges. But he could 
hope that the damped-field projec- 
tors his men took with them into the 
fight would prevent any nuclear 
explosion. He sent living men to 
board because it was believed that 
Hell held living human prisoners. 
His hopes were justified; or at least. 



for whatever reason, no nuclear ex- 
plosion came. 

The beliefs about prisoners were 
not easily confirmed. Ercul, the 
cybernetic psychologist who came 
when the fighting was over to in- 
vestigate, certainly found humans 
there. In a way. In part. Odd or- 
gans that functioned in a sort-of 
way, interconnected with the non- 
human and the non-alive. The or- 
gans were most of them human 
brains, which had been grown in 
culture through use of the tech- 
niques that berserkers must have 
captured with some of our hospital 
ships. 

Our human laboratories grow 
the culture-brains from seedlings of 
human embryo-tissue, grow them to 
adult size and then dissect them as 
needed. A doctor slices off a pre- 



100 



frontal lobe, say, and puts it into 
the skull of a man whose own cor- 
responding brain-part has been 
destroyed by some disease or vio- 
lence. The culture-brain material 
serves as a matrix for regrowth, raw 
material on which the old person- 
ality can re-impress itself. The cul- 
ture-brains, raised in glass jars, are 
not human except in potential. Even 
a layman can readily distinguish one 
of them from a normally developed 
brain by the visible absence of the 
finer surface convolutions. The 
culture-brains cannot be human in 
the sense of maintaining sentient 
human minds. Certain hormones and 
other subtle chemicals of the body- 
environments are necessary for the 
development of a brain with per- 
sonality — not to mention the need 
for the stimuli of experience, the 
continual impact of the senses. In- 
deed some sensory input is needed 
if the culture-brain is to develop 
even to the stage of a template us- 
able by the surgeon. For this in- 
put music is commonly employed. 

The berserkers had doubtless 
learned to culture livers and hearts 
and gonads as well as brains, but it 
was only man’s thinking ability that 
interested them deeply. The berserk- 
ers must have stood in their com- 
puter-analogue of awe as they re- 
garded the memory-capacity and the 
decision-making power that nature 
in a few billion years of evolution 
had managed to pack into the few 
hundred cubic centimeters of the 
human nervous system. 

Off and on through their long 
war with men the berserkers had 
tried to incorporate human brains 



into their own circuitry. Never Bad 
they succeeded to their own satis- 
faction, but they kept dying. 

The berserkers themselves of 
course named nothing. But 
were not far wrong in calling this 
center of their research Hell. This 
Hell lay hidden in the center of the 
dark Taynarus nebula, which in turn 
was roughly centered in a triangle 
formed by the Zitz and Toxx and 
Yaty systems. Men had known for 
years what Hell was and approxi- 
mately where it was, before they 
could muster armed strength enough 
in this part of their sector of the 
galaxy to go in and find it and 
root it out. 

C4T certify that in this container 

X there is no human life,” said 
the cybernetic psychologist, Ercul, 
under his breath, at the same time 
stamping the words on the glassite 
case before him. Ercul’s assistant 
gestured, and the able-bodied space- 
man working with them pulled the 
power-connectors loose and let the 
thing in the tank begin to die. 

This one was not a culture-brain 
but had once been the nervous sys- 
tem of a living prisoner. It had 
been greatly damaged, not only by 
removal of most of its human body, 
but by being connected to a mass 
of electronic and micromechanical 
gear. Through some training pro- 
gram, probably a combination of 
punishment and reward, the ber- 
serker had then taught this brain 
to perform certain computing oper- 
ations at great speed and with low 
probability of error. It seemed that 
every time the computations had 



STARSONG 



101 




been finiished the mechanism in the 
case with the brain had immediately 
reset aJl the counters to zero and 
once more presented the same in- 
puts, whereupon the brain’s task 
had started over. The brain now 
seen>ed incapable of anything but 
going on with the job; and if that 
was really a kind of human life, 
which was not a possibility that Er- 
cul was going to admit out loud, it 
was in his opinion a kind that was 
better terminated as soon as possi- 
ble. 

“Next case?” he asked the space- 
men. Then he realized he had just 
made a horrible pun upon his judge’s 
role. But none of his fellow harrow- 
ers of Hell seemed to have noticed 
it. But just give us a few more 
days on the job, he thought, and we 
will start finding things to laugh at. 

Anyway, he had to get on with 
his task of trying to distinguish 
rescued prisoners — two of these 
had been confirmed so far and might 
some day again look human — 
from a collection of bottled, though 
more cc less functioning organs. 

When they brought the next case 
before him, he had a bad moment, 
bad eveai for this day, recognizing 
some of his own work. 

The story of it had started more 
than a standard year before, on the 
not-far-off planet of Zitz, in a huge 
hall that had been decorated and 
thronged for one of the merriest of 
occasions. 

CCTJappy, honey?” Ordell Calli- 
AJ.son asked his bride, having 
a moment to take her hand and 
speak to her under the tumult of 
102 



the wedding feast. It was not that 
he had any doubt of her happi- 
ness; it was just that the banal two- 
word question was the best utter- 
ance that he could find — unless, 
of course, he were to sing. 

“Ohhh, happy, yes I” At the 
moment Eury* was no more arti- 
culate than he. But the truth of her 
words was in her voice and in her 
eyes, marvelous as some song that 
Ordell might have made and sung. 

Of course he was not going to be 
allowed to get away, even for hia 
honeymoon, without singing one 
song at least. 

“Sing something, Ordell!” That 
was Hyman Bolf, calling from across 
the vast banquet table, where he 
stood filling his cup at the crystal 
punch-fountain.. The famed multi- 
faith revivalist had come from Yaty 
system to perform the wedding cere- 
mony. On landing, his private ship 
had misbehaved oddly, the hydro- 
gen power lamp flaring so that the 
smoke of burnt insulation had caused 
the reverend to emerge from his 
cabin with irritated eyes; but after 
that bad omen, everything had gone 
w^ell for the rest of the day. 

Other voices took it up at once. 
“Sing, Ordell!” 

“Yes, you’ve got to. Sing!” 

“But it’s m’own wedding, and I 
don’t feel quite right — ” 

His objections were overwhelm- 
ingly shouted down. 

The man was music, and indeed 
his happiness today was such that 
he felt he might burst if he could 
not express it. He got to his feet, 
and one of his most trusted man- 
servants, who had foreseen that Or- 

IF 




dell would sing, was ready to bring 
him his self-invented instrument. 
Crammed into a small box that Or- 
dell could hang from his neck like 
an accordion was a speaker sys- 
tem from woofer to tweeter, plus 
a good bit of electronics and audi- 
onics; on the box’s plain surface 
there were ten spots for Ordell’s ten 
fingers to play upon. His “music 
box,” he called it, having to call 
it something. Ordell’s imitators had 
had bigger and flashier and better 
music boxes made for them; but 
surprisingly few people, even among 
girls between twelve and twenty, 
cared to listen to Ordell’s imitators. 

So Ordell Callison sang at his own 
wedding, and his audience was en- 
thralled by him as people always 
were; as people had been by no 
other performer in all the ancient 
records of Man. The highbrowed 
music critics sat rapt in their places 
of honor at the head table; the cul- 
tured and not-so-cultured moneyed 
folk of Zitz and Toxx and Yaty, 
some of whom had come in their 
private racing ships, and the more 
ordinary guests, all were made hap- 
py by his song as no wine could 
have made them. And the adolescent 
girls, the Ordell fans who crowded 
and huddled inevitably outside the 
doors, they yielded themselves to his 
music to the point of fainting and 
beyond. 

A couple of weeks later Ordell 
and Eury and his new friends 
of the last fast years, the years of 
success and staggering wealth, were 
out in space in their sporty one- 
seater ships playing the game they 
STARSONG 



called Tag. This time Ordell was 
playing the game in a sort of 
reversed way, dodging about in one 
corner of the reserved volume of 
space, really trying to avoid the 
girl-ships that fluttered past in- 
stead of going after them. 

He had been keeping an eye out 
for Eury’s ship and getting a little 
anxious about not being able to find 
it, when from out of nowhere there 
came shooting toward Ordell an- 
other boy-ship, the signals of emer- 
gency blazing from it across the 
spectrum. In another minute every- 
one had ceased To play. The screens 
of all the little ships imaged the 
face of Arty, the young man whose 
racer had just braked to a halt be- 
side Ordell’s. 

Arty was babbling: “I tried, Or- 
dell — Tmean I didn’t try to — I 
didn’t mean her any harm — they’ll 
get her back — it wasn’t my fault 
she — ” 

With what seemed great slowness, 
the truth of what had happened be- 
came clear. Arty had chased and 
overtaken Eury’s ship, as was the 
way of the game. He had clamped 
his ship to hers and boarded and 
then thought to claim the usual 
prize. But Eury of course was mar- 
ried now; and being married meant 
much to her, as it did to Ordell, who 
today had only played at catching 
girls. Somehow both of them had 
thought that everyone else must see 
how the world had changed since 
they were married, how the rules of 
the game of Tag would have to be 
amended for them from now on. 

Unable to convince Arty by 
argument of how things stood. Eury 

103 




had had to struggle to make her 
point. She had somehow injured 
her foot, trying to evade him in the 
little cabin. He kept on stubbornly 
trying to claim his prize. It came 
out later that he had only agreed 
to go back to his own ship for a 
first-aid kit (she swore that her 
ship’s kit was missing) after her 
seeming promise that he could have 
what he wanted when he returned. 

But when he had gone back to his 
ship, she broke her own racer free 
and fled. And he pursued. Drove 
her into a comer, against the boun- 
dary of the safety zone, which was 
guarded by automated warships 
against the possibility of berserker 
incursions. 

To get away from Arty she 
crossed that border in a great 
speeding curve, no doubt meaning 
to come back to safety within ten 
thousand miles or so. 

She never made it. As her little 
racer sped close to an outlying wisp 
of dark Taynarus, the berserker 
machine that had been lurking 
there pounced out. 

O f course Ordell did not hear the 
story in such coherent form, 
but what he heard was enough. On 
the screens of the other little ships 
his tace at first seemed to be turned 
to stone by what he heard; but then 
his look became suddenly wild and 
mad. Arty cringed away, but Or- 
dell did not stop for a moment for 
him. Instead he drove at racer’s 
speed out where his wife had gone. 
He shot through the zone of the 
protective patrols (which were set 
to keep intruders out, not to hold 

104 



the mad or reckless in) and plunged 
between outlying dustclouds to ea- 
ter one of the vast crevices that led 
into the heart of Taynarus, into the 
maze where ships and machines 
must all go slow and from which 
no living human had emerged since 
the establishment of Hell. 

Some hours later, the outer 
sentries of the berserker came 
around his little ship, demanding 
in their well learned human speedi 
that he halt and submit to capture. 
He only slowed his little ship still 
further and began to sing to the 
berserker over the radio, taking his 
hands from his racer’s controls to 
put his fingers on the keys of his 
music box. Unsteered, his ship 
drifted away from the center of the 
navigable passage, grazing the neb- 
ular wall and suffering the pocking 
blasts of microcollisions with its gas 
and dust. 

But before his ship was wrecked, 
the berserker’s sentry-devices gave 
up shouting radio commands and 
sent a boarding party of machines. 

Through the memory banks of 
Hell they had some experience of 
insanity, of the more bizarre forms 
of human behavior. They searched 
the racer for weapons, searched Or- 
dell — allowed him to keep his 
music box when it too had been ex- 
amined and he kept on struggling 
for it — and passed him on as a 
prisoner to the jurisdiction of the 
inner guards. 

Hell, a mass of fortified metal 
miles in diameter, received him and 
his racer through its main entrance. 
He got out of his ship and found 
himself able to breathe and walk 

IF 




and see where he was going; the 
physical environment in Hell was 
for the most part mild and pleas- 
ant, because prisoners did not as a 
rule, survive very long, and the com- 
puter-brains of the berserker did not 
want to impose unnecessary stresses 
upon them. 

The berserker devices having im- 
mediate control over the routine 
operations in Hell were themselves in 
large part organic, containing cul- 
ture-brains grown for the purpose 
and some re-educated captured 
brains as well. These were all ex- 
amples of the berserker’s highest 
achievements in its attempt at re- 
verse cybernation. 

Before Ordell had taken a dozen 
steps away from his ship, he was 
stopped and questioned by one of 
these monsters. Half steel and cir- 
cuitry, half culture-flesh, it carried 
in three crystal globes its three po- 
tentially-human brains, their too- 
smooth surfaces bathed in nutrient 
and woven with hair-fine wires. 

“Why have you come here?” the 
monster asked him, speaking 
through a diaphragm in its mid- 
section. 

Only now did Ordell begin at all 
to maike a conscious plan. At the 
core of his thought was the knowl- 
edge that in the human laboratories 
music was used to tune and tone 
the culture^brains and that his own 
music was as superior for that pur- 
pose as it was by all other standards. 

T o the three-headed monster he 
sang very simply that he had 
come here ody to seek his young 
wife, pure accident had brought her, 
STARSONG 



ahead of time, to the end of her 
life. In one of the old formal 
languages in which he sang so wdl 
of deep things, he implored the 
power in charge of this domain of 
terror, this kingdom of silence and 
unborn creatures, to tie fast again 
the thread of Eury’s life. If you 
deny me this, he sang, I cannot 
return to the world of the living 
alone, and you here will have us 
both. 

The music, that had conveyed 
nothing but its mathematical ele- 
ments to the cold computer-brains 
outside, melted the trained purpose 
of the inner, half-fleshly guardians. 
The three-brained monster passed 
him on to others, and each in turn 
found its set aim yielding to the 
hitherto unknown touch of beauty, 
found harmony and melody calling 
up the buried human things that 
transcended logic. 

He walked steadily deeper into 
Hell, and they could not resist. His 
music was leaked into a hundred ex- 
periments through audio-inputs, vi- 
brated faintly through the mountings 
of glassite cases, was sensed by tor- 
tured nerve-cells through the chang- 
es in inductance and capacities that 
emanated rhythmically from Or- 
dell’s music box. Brains that had 
known nothing but to be forced to 
the limit of their powers in useless 
calculation — brains that had been 
hammered into madness with the 
leakage of a millimicrovolt from an 
inserted probe — these heard his 
music, felt it, sensed it, each with 
its own unique perception, and re- 
acted. 

A hundred experiments were in- 

105 




(Erupted, became unreliable, were 
totally ruined. The overseers, half 
flesh themselves, failed and fumbled 
in their programmed purpose, com- 
ing to the decision that the asked-for 
prisoner must be brought forth and 
released. 

The ultimate-controlling, pure 
berserker computer — pure metallic 
cold, totally immune to this strange 
jamming that was wreaking havoc in 
its laboratory — descended at last 
from its concentration on high stra- 
tegic planning to investigate. And 
then it turned its full energy at 
once to regaining control over what 
was going on within the heart of 
Hell. But it tried in vain, for the 
moment at least. It had given too 
much power to its half-alive crea- 
tions; it had trusted too much to 
fickle protoplasm to be true to its 
conditioning. 

Ordell was standing before the 
two linked, potentially-human brains 
which were under the berserker it- 
self, the lords and superintendents 
of Hell. These two like all their less- 
er kind had been melted and de- 
flected by Ordell’s music; and now 
they were fighting back with all the 
electric speed at their command 
against their cold master’s attempt 
to reaffirm its rule. Hiey held mag- 
netic relays like fortresses against 
the berserker; they maintained their 
grip on the outposts that were fer- 
rite cores; they fought to hold a 
frontier that wavered through the 
territory of control. 

“Then take her away,” said the 
voice of these refoeUious overseers 
to Ordell Callison. “But do not stop 
singing, do not pause for breath for 
106 



more than a second, until you are in 
your ship and away, clear of Hell’s 
outermost gate.” 

Ordell sang on, sang of his new 
joy at the wonderful hope that they 
were giving him. 

A door hissed open behind him, 
and he turned to see Eury com- 
ing through it. She was limping on 
her injured foot, which had never 
been taken care of, but he could 
see that she was really all right. The 
machines had not started to open 
her head. 

“Do not pause!” barked the voder 
at him. “Go!” 

Eury moaned at the sight of her 
husband and stretched out her arms 
to him, but he dared do no more 
than motion with his head for her 
to follow him, even as his song 
swelled to a paean of triumphant 
joy. He walked out along the nar- 
row passage through which he had 
come, moving now in a direction 
that no one else had ever traveled. 
The way was so narrow that he had 
to keep on going ahead while Eury 
followed. He had to keep from 
even turning his head to look at 
her, to concentrate the power of 
his music on each new guardian 
that rose before him, half-alive and 
questioning; once more each one in 
turn opened a door. Always he 
could hear behind him the sob- 
bing of his wife and the dragging 
stepping of her wounded foot. 

“Orddl? Ordell, honey, is that 
really you? I can’t believe ’tis.” 
Ahead, the last danger, the three- 
brained sentry of the outer gate, rose 
to block their way, under orders to 

IF 




prevent escape. Ordell sang of the 
freedom in living in a human body, 
of running over unfenced grass 
through sunlit air. The gatekeeper 
bowed aside again, to let them pass. 

“Hooey? Turn an’ look at me, 
tell me this is not some other trick 
they’re playin’. Honey, if y’love me, 
turn?” 

Turning, he saw her clearly for 
the first time since he had entered 
Hell. To Ordell her beauty was such 
that it stopped time, stopped even 
the song in his throat and his fing- 
ers on the keys of music. A moment 
free of the strange influence that 
had perverted all its creatures was 
all the time that the berserker need- 
ed to re-establish something close 
to complete control. The three- 
headed shape seized Eury and bore 
her away from her husband, car-^ 
ried her back through doorway 
after doorway of darkness, so fast 
that her last scream of farewell 
could scarcely reach the ears of 
her man. “Good-bye . love . .” 

He cried out and ran after her, 
beating uselessly on a massive door 
that slammed in his face. He hung 
there on the door for a long time, 
screaming and pleading for one more 
chance to get his wife away. He sang 
again, but the berserker had re- 
established its icy control too firm- 
ly — it had not entirely regained 
power, however, for though the half- 
living overseers no longer obeyed 
Ordell, neither did they molest him. 
They left the way open for him to 
depart. 

He lingered for about seven days 
there at the gate, in his small ship 
and out of it, without food or sleep, 
STARSONG 



singing uselessly until no voice was 
left him. Then he collapsed inside 
his ship. Then he, or more likely his 
autc^ilot, drove the racer away from 
the berserker and back toward free- 
dom. 

The berserker defenses did not, 
any more than the human, question 
a small ship coming out. Probably 
they assumed it to be one of their 
own scouts or raiders. There were 
never any escapes from Hell. 

B ack on the planet Zitz his man- 
agers greeted him as one risen 
from the dead. In a few days’ time 
he was to give a live concert, which 
had long been scheduled and sold 
out. In another day the managers 
and promoters would have had to 
begin returning money. 

He did not really co-operate with 
the doctors who worked to restore 
his strength, but neither did he op- 
pose them. As soon as his voice 
came back he began to sing again; 
he sang most of the time, except 
when they drugged him to sleep. 
And it did not matter to him wheth- 
er they sent him onto a stage to do 
his singing again. 

The live performance was billed 
as one of his pop concerts, which in 
practice meant a hall overflowing 
with ten thousand adolescent girls, 
who were elevated even beyond their 
usual level of excitement by the 
miracles of Ordell’s bereavement, 
resurrection and ghastly appearance. 

During the first song or two the 
girls were awed and relatively silent, 
quiet enough so that Ordell’s voice 
could be heard. Then — well, one 
girl in ten thousand would scream 

107 




it aloud: “You’re ours again!” There 
was a sense in which his marriage 
had . been resented. 

Casually and indifferently looking 
out over them all, he smiled out of 
habit and began to sing how much 
he hated them and scorned them, 
seeing in them nothing but hopeless 
ugliness. 

For a few moments the currents 
of emotion in the great hall balanced 
against one another to produce the 
illusion of calm. Ordell”s deadly voice 
was clear. But then the storm of 
reaction broke, and he could no 
longer be heard. The powers of hate 
and kist, rage and demand bore all 
before them. The ushers who al- 
ways labored to form a barricade 
at a Callison concert were swept 
away at once by ten thousand girls. 

Ihe riot was over in a minute, 
ended by the police. 

Ordell himself was nearly dead. 
Medical help arrived only just in 
time to save the life in the tissues 
of his brain. 

N ext day the leading cybernetic- 
psychologist on Zitz was called 
in by Ordell Callison’s doctors. They 
were saving what remained of Or- 
dell’s life, but they had not been 
able to open any bridge of com- 
munication with him. 

Ercul, the psychologist, sank probes 
directly into Ordell’s brain, so that 
this information could be given him. 
Next he connected the speech cen- 
ters to a voder device loaded with 
recordings of Or dell’s own voice, so 
that the tones that issued were the 
same as had once come from 
his throat. And — in response to the 
1C8 



crippled man’s first request — to 
the motor-centers that had con- 
trolled Ordell ’s fingers went probes 
connected to a music box. 

After that he at once began to 
sing. 

They took him to the spaceport. 
With his life-support system of tubes 
and nourishment and electricity, 
they put him aboard his racer. And 
with the autopilot programmed as 
he commanded, they sent him out, 
fired along the course that be had 
chosen. 

E rcul knew Ordell and Eury 
when he found them, together 
in the same experimental case. Re- 
cognizing his own work on Ordell, 
he felt certain even before the elec- 
troencephalogram patterns matched 
with his old records. 

There was little left of either of 
them. 

“Dols only two points above nor- 
mal bias level,” chanted the psy- 
chologist’s assistant, taking routine 
readings, not guessing whose pain 
it was he was attempting to judge. 
“Neither of them seems to be hurt- 
ing. At the moment, anyway.” 

In a heavy hand, Ercul lifted his 
stamp and marked the case. / cer- 
tify that in this container there is 
no human life. 

The assistant looked up in mild 
surprise at this quick decision. 
“There is some mutual awareness 
here, I would say, between the two 
subjects.” He spoke in a business- 
like, almost cheerful voice. He had 
been enough hours on the job now 
to start getting used to it. 

But Ercul never would. END

INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL 
AND ETERNAL LIFE 

by R. C. W. Ettinger 



C ertain primitives recognize only 
three numbers: one, two, and 
many. Other primitives — present 
company not excepted — can cate- 
gorize life spans in only three ways: 
normal, extended, and greatly ex- 
tended. 

There is little psychological dis- 
tinction between life spans of a 
thousand years, a million years or 
eternity, for obvious reasons. A thou- 
sand years will almost certainly pro- 
duce such vast and profound changes 
that we can scarcely speculate on 
what will interest us then; it is even 
possible that Destiny will have been 
fulfilled. Nevertheless, just for the 
fun of it, we may conjecture about 
the chance of individuals living 
literally forever. To many, this is an 
“obvious” impossibility; but what is 
“obvious” is often wrong, and ap«^ 
pears to be in this case. 

Oddly related to the question of 
immortality, as we shall see, is that 
of interstellar travel; in fact, the 
former appears to be necessary for 
the latter. 

At first thought, the obstacles to 



Robert Ettinger Is the non who, a few 
years ago, electrified America by pro- 
posing seriously what most of us had 
thought was only a "sdenc^ficHon'' Idea 
— f.e.. Immortality by means of freezing. 
Now he turns his attention to some of 
the consequences of that kind of im- 
mortality — and what It means to some 
other major science-fiction Ideas! 



interstellar journey are impressive. 
The human life span is short, and 
human tolerance of acceleration 
small; interstellar distances are vast; 
the limiting velocity of light can be 
approached only by enormous ex- 
penditure of energy. 

What of it? Human life may be ex- 
tended, or astronauts frozen (which 
would increase their acceleration 
tolerance as well), or robots may be 
used; we will soon have fusion en- 
ergy and later possibly total-an- 
nihilation energy. Many writers have 
assumed the difficulties will be over- 
come. 

For example, in Planets for Man 



109 





(Random House, 1964) Dole and 
Asimov anticipate flight at a large 
fraction of the velocity of light, “al- 
though the expenditure of energy 
needed for accelerating to such 
velocities are enormous.” They note 
that, “If one is willing to spend 20 
years en route, then trips to start 4 
light-years away (the nearest) could 
be made at one-fifth the speed of 
light (37,000 miles per second); 
trips to stars 10 light-years away 
could be made one-^half the speed of 
light (93,000 miles per second); 
trips to stars 15 light-years away 
could be made at three-quarters the 
speed of light (140,000 miles per 
second) ; and so on.” They also 
point out that relativity theory be- 
comes important at speeds close to 
light, and that subjective time of 
travel in this case would be greatly 
reduced for the astronauts; they 
would age much more slowly than 
the stay-at-^homes. 

This sounds very nice, but it is 
much too vague. Others have looked 
more closely and found the picture 
not so rosy. For example. Sebastian 
von Hoerner has contributed a hori- 
fying little analysis in a compendium 
called Interstellar Communication 
(W. A. Benjamin, 1963, ed. A. G. W. 
Cameron) . 

First, he notes that if a live, un- 
frozen crew is used, and if they can- 
not tolerate permanent acceleration 
of more tthan 1 g (Earth normal), 
then long subjective times and ex- 
tremely long objective times are re- 
quired to reach lany but the nearest 
stars. 

If 10 years pass for the crew, the 
observers on Earth will measure 



24 years for the round trip, and the 
range will be only 3 parsecs. To 
reach to 5400 parsecs (roughly only 
a tenth of the diameter of the galaxy) 
would require 36,000 years, which 
would feel like 40 years to the crew 
for the round trip. How very dis- 
couraging! 

But the energy considerations are 
even more discouraging. In fact, they 
rule out everything except total an- 
nihilation fuel and photon thrust; 
and when the acceleration require- 
ment is added, the power demands 
are simply absurd. According to von 
Hoemer (and others) to produce 1 g 
acceleration by emitting radiation in 
the backward direction requires — 
hold on! — 100 million horse- 
power per ounce of loaded rocket! 
Furthermore, this power must be 
gotten rid of. A technology capable 
of this would have to be able to 
build an engine as powerful as an 
auto engine (200 horsepower) 
weighing a tenth as much as a paper 
clip and also able to radiate energy 
about as fast as a 100 kilowatt bat- 
tery of searchlights; all this before 
even beginning to consider payload 
and fuel. 

Avenues of Interstellar Flight 

G eorge Gallup, the renowned poll- 
ster, reviewing 30 years of opin- 
ion-sampling, has point^ out that the 
public often has remarkably good 
judgment — frequently better than 
that of the experts in their own 
fields! (The people wanted air power 
built up long before the military 
agreed, e/c., etc,) And it has often 
been pointed out that in American 



110 



IF 




histary the only realist is the optimist. 
A “mere, vague” optimism about fu- 
ture progress is probably a better 
Iguide to interstellar prospects than 
von Hoemer’s carefully documented 
pessimism. 

But fortunately, we have more 
than vague optimism to go on. Un- 
der certain assumptions, long trips 
might be acceptable, and if human 
passengers are desired and genera- 
tions are not to pass, they could be 
frozen for most of the trip, with a 
few thawed out from time to time 
to stand watch ... as all science- 
fiction readers are aware. It is also 
possible to beat down the obstacles 
by sheer brute force: when intelli- 
gent, self-repairing and reproducing 
robots are made, considerations of 
cost will virtually disappear, and it 
may not be beyond the bounds of 
reason to build a ship of planetary 
size, if necessary, to carry a small 
payload; in other words, we need 
not be limited by “reasonable” fuel- 
load ratios. 

Finally, of course, there is the 
possibility of new breakthroughs in 
principle producing a whole new ball 
game with Einstein replaced as um- 
pire, as Newton was before him. But 
there exist presently only the most 
tenuous hints of this, and we will 
not count on it. 

For now the most reasonable 
attitude, I believe, is that inter- 
stellar flight will not be impossi- 
ble even for relatively crude tech- 
nology, and will not be easy or triv- 
ial even for highly advanced tech- 
nology. 

How this relates to immortality 
we shall see. 



Indefinitely Extended Life 

B efore asking whether one can live 
forever, we must ask whether 
one can live indefinitely — i.e., 
whether “natural death” can be 
eliminated. And the first question 
in this category is whether senility 
can be prevented or/and cured. 

In general terms, it seems obvious 
that it can: given a sufficient de- 
gree of tedinical skill, one can pre- 
vent or correct the disorders and 
malfunctions that make the body 
and brain decrepit. 

Indefinitely extended life is even 
possible for our generation, through 
either cryogenic interment or sus- 
pended animation. At present the 
only hope is cryogenic interment — 
freezing the newly dead in the hope 
of eventual revival and rejuvenation. 

Statistics and Expansion 

A pparently most scientists assume 
that eternal life is impossible 
for fundamental physical and mathe- 
matical reasons, which have been 
made explicit by James S. Hayes. 
(In “Technological Routes to Im- 
mortality,” The Scientist Speculates, 
Basic Books, 1962.) However, I think 
Prof. Hayes is wrong, both in his 
reasons for giving up on unlimited 
life in the full and in the limited 
substitute he suggests. 

He says, first, that if there is any 
chance at all of accidental death in 
a normal life span, then in the long 
run death is certain; second, that 
even if fatal accidents were somehow 
completely eliminated, any birth rate, 
however small, would eventually re-

suit in population pressures that even 
emigration at the speed of light could 
not relieve; third, that in any case 
an immortal could not retain all his 
memories, since the physical storage 
requirement would eventually 'bring 
the day when a solid sphere of or- 
ganized matter expanding at the velo- 
city of light would not be adequate. 

He then suggests that the accident 
problem be met 'by sharing one’s 
identity with several others in several 
bodies, and the storage problem by 
culling memories periodically to keep 
only those most valued: “Since per- 
sonal identity, like life itself, clearly 
consists of an ordered structure of 
information, a ‘message,’ and since 
messages can be replicated indefi- 
nitely many times, there is no rea- 
son why any one personal identity 
could not be simultaneously made 
available to several brains and be 
said to inhabit simultaneously many 
bodies .... By the use of many 
bodies the probability of the acciden- 
tal extinction of a personal identity 
can be made as small as we please. A 
time may come when almost every 
person one meets will have at least 
some part of his identity in com- 
mon with oneself. Under these con- 
ditions the death of a body would 
not be a reason for grief, as now 
death is a reason for grief.” 

Perhaps we might not object too 
strongly to periodic weeding out of 
excess baggage in our memories, 
since selection and loss occur rou- 
tinely in our ordinary lives anyway, 
willynilly. But few, I imagine, will 
agree that personal identity “clearly” 
(!) consists of an “ordered struc- 
ture of information.” Elsewhere (in 



The Prospect of Immortality, Dou- 
bleday, 1964) I have considered the 
problem of identity in chapter length 
and concluded that it is very far 
from solved. It will suffice here to 
point out, in Prof. Hayes’s own 
words, what most people will con- 
sider a reductio ad absiirdiini'. “If 
identity resides in ordered informa- 
tion, the distinction between the 
metaphorical immortality of a man 
in his work and his literal personal 
■immortality is one of quantity rather 
than (or as the Marxists would say, 
transforming into) one of quality. It 
is merely a matter of a difference 
of a few orders of magnitude in the 
amount of information transmitted.” 
Rejecting his solution, we must 
find loopholes in his mathematics, 
and then a way to crawl through 
the loopholes. 

T he first is not difficult, because 
his ajithmetic is based on a false 
premise, v/z., that the probability of 
death in a year (say) must have a 
lower bound. For non-mathcmatical 
readers we can illustrate the point, 
and also illuminate an old riddle, by 
explaining Zeno’s Paradox. 

Zeno asked how can I get from 
here to there? Obviously, I must first 
cover half the distance, and to do 
that I must first cover 1/4 the dis- 
tance, etcr, he journey may be 
mentally broken down into an in- 
finite number of finite segments, 
each requiring finite time; since the 
sum of an infinite number of non- 
zero intervals is infinite — is it not? 
— infinite time must be required to 
move any distance. 

The answer is that the sum of 




an infinite numt>er of non-zero 
quantities is not necessarily infinite. 
(This is obviously so, since a two- 
inch line can be divided into an in- 
finite number of segments, but the 
total of those segments is still two 
inches, not infinity. The sum Vz + 
V2 + V2 . is infinite; the sum 
V2 + V3 + V4: ... is infinite; but the sum 
V2 + V 4 : + ^ . .= 1. The sum of an 
infinite series can be finite, if the 
terms of the series diminish fast 
enough. 

Now we see how, in principle, 
Hayes’ second and third obstacles 
can be overcome. We need never 
give up breeding altogether (although 
it will not be required for evolu- 
tion); we need only reduce the rate 
of reproduction fast enough, indef- 
initely, without ever reaching zero. 
And we need sacrifice no memories 
(although we will have plenty to 
spare. We need only regulate their 
rate of accumulation. Note careful- 
ly that we do not even have to ac- 
quire memories more slowly — only 
more slowly as a percentage incre- 
ment per unit time per unit volume 
of space. The annual percentage 
growth in brain tissue will have to 
decrease, but not the tonnage. 

Now, a reader of decent sensibili- 
ties will be stunned by the word 
“tonnage.” Tons of brain tissue? Of 
course, there is a certain apparently 
irreducible minimum amount of 
matter, in mass and volume, re- 
quired to store a unit of informa- 
tion, and if we jettison no memories, 
eventually we must become gigantic. 
Even storing “our” memories in a 
separate mechanical store or comput- 
er, plugged in at will, cannot avoid 

INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL & ETERNAL LIFE 



giantism, for several reasons. In any 
case, we do not want to avoid gian- 
tism — it is our salvation with re- 
spect to the accidental death bogey. 

T here is a certain risk of catastro- 
phe per year per cubic yard, 
and we can hardly expect to keep 
reducing this risk fast enough, for- 
ever; hence any ordinary individual 
must expect a fatal accident sooner 
or later. But a society, if it spreads 
out fast enough, can have a non- 
zero probability of infini te life. 

Can an individual do the same? 
Certainly! To begin with, we may 
think of ourselves as located at a 
point in space. But we are not: each 
of us occupies an appreciable 
volume, and can sacrifice consider- 
able material without disaster. For 
example, rays from radioactive ele- 
ments constantly damage or kill cells 
of our bodies — thousands daily — 
but we replace them and carry on, 
and in fact do not even notice it. 

Of course, it is absurd to think 
we can just grow huge and keep this 
up indefinitely. Neither can we 
stomach the notion of submerging 
ourselves in a “hive” organism, with 
individuals playing the role of cells 
in a super-being; we do not want 
to be reduced to the status of bees 
or ants or anything similar. The 
answer is that we will develop a 
new type of body, the parts of which 
will not be physically glued together. 

It is simply a matter of communi- 
cation. The hemispheres of a brain, 
for example, in principle ought to be 
capable of integration by wires, or 
even radio, rather than nerves; and 
the same thing is true of smaller 

113 




components. We must envisage a 
race of titans, each multicorporeal, 
bis body divided into myriad com- 
ponents attenuated over a large and 
increasing volume of space, inte- 
grated by something like radio waves. 
If a star goes nova, only a few 
planets may be lost — a trifle, a 
toenail. 

As always, there will be a price. 

In particular, ithe giants will live 
slowly, of necessity. M you are spread 
over a trillion cubic light-years, and 
your nervous system signals from one 
part of you to anotlher at the speed 
of light, it will take you a long while 
to think and act. It is interesting to 
speculate, however, that this may 
explain the mysterious absence of 
emissaries from 'higher civilizations: 
any civilization much beyond the 
present human stage enters the mac- 
ro-cosmic phase and is completely 
cut of touch. 

In addition to size and slowness, 
the giants might have another bizarre 
quality: intermingling of bodies. If 
the purpose of giantism is immortali- 
ty, avoiding catastrophe 'by having 
one’s parts scattered over immense 
volumes, any smaO volume (say a 
planet) would not have to be re- 
served for a single individual. Thus 
a galaxy, say, might support billions 
of individuals, each one scattered on- 
to billions of planets and each planet 
supporting parts of billions of differ- 
ent people. 

People? Beings, rather. Or even 
gods. They could hardly be much 
like ourselves, whose psychology and 
culture are strongily dependent on 
the physical character of our bodies. 
Ibeir lives would not necessarily be 



entirely mental, but they would in- 
deed be strange. They could not 
stand, sit, walk, talk or even have a 
definite location in any easily under- 
stood sense. 

An obvious nasty conjecture is that 
the (giants are alr^dy in our region 
of space, and in fact we, all unwit- 
ting, are their “cells”; that our or- 
ganization, from our point of view, 
is inefficient and often unpleasant 
may interest them not at all. 

An even nastier conjecture is that 
we are not yet cells, but will shortly 
be taken over for that purpose, when 
we reach an appropriate stage of 
development. But “they” would hard- 
ly work in such a sloppy manner, 
nor use fully self-conscious cells. 

I hope it is understood that I am 
not postulating nor predicting the 
existence of Giants. I think any such 
development unlikely in the extreme; 
-instead, I think it nearly certain that 
new discoveries and ways of thinking 
will appear in the next few cen- 
turies to outmode all such questions. 

I cannot conceive that we will ever 
seriously worry about eternal life as 
contrasted with life “merely” extend- 
ed for thousands or tens of thousands 
of years. I doubt very much that 
the present “limiting” laws of phys- 
ics — those of relativity and quan- 
tum mechanics — will retain thei 
supposed fundamental character for- 
ever. The purpose of the little exer- 
cise above, other than having some 
fun, is just to put in their places 
those who take smug and narrow 
views concerning what can and can- 
not happen, in the indefinite future.

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

/ n the Spring of 1978 an object nals nor replies in any detectable 

which later proves to be an alien fashion to the signals being directed 

spaceship enters the solar system and toward it, 

takes up a near-circular orbit some The decision is taken to divert and 
sixty million miles from the Sun, sacrifice the Jupiter Probe, an un~ 

Every radio and optical telescope manned observation satellite then on 

which can be brought to bear is di- its way to the Jovian system, in an 

rected at the Ship, but it neither sig- attempt to gather information on th9 








intruder. As a result there is relayed 
back to Earth a series of low-defini- 
tion pictures of a vessel shaped like a 
blunt torpedo with a pattern of bulges 
around its mid-section. The Ship is 
half a mile long. 

Silently and, some think, implac- 
ably the Ship orbits like some vast 
battleship cruising off the coast of 
a tiny, backward island. Inevitably 
there are natives who want an even 
closer look, and two small, sophisti- 
cated dugout canoes are modified 
and readied for launching. 

Choosing men for the Prometheus 
Project is no easy task. If the human 
race is to derive the maximum bene- 
fit from this first contact with a 
highly advanced alien culture — al- 
ways assuming, of course, that the 
extraterrestrial crew is friendly — 
the six men must represent the widest 
possible spread of the social and 
physical sciences. The men must also 
be capable of surviving the longest 
and most hazardous voyage in human 
history and of asking the right ques- 
tions at the end of it. And so, des- 
pite the hundreds of eminent and re- 
spected scientists who volunteer for 
the trip, the final decision lies with 
the space medics who insist on send- 
ing six men unknown in the higher 
scientific circles and respected only 
by their friends — four experienced 
astronauts and two who are still un- 
der training. These six will, it is 
thought, stand a fairly good chance 
of bringing home the bacon. 

It is perhaps significant that none 
of the six chosen to crew the P- 
ships are married. 

In P-Two there is McCUL- 
LOUGH, a doctor and nominally a 



lieutenant colonel who has been un- 
dergoing training for MOL service, 
and veteran pilots Captain BERRY- 
MAN and Major WALTERS, P- 
One*s crew consists of Colonel MOR- 
RISON, leader of the expedition and 
Major DREW, both of whom are 
trained astronauts and Captain HOL- 
LIS, a physicist engaged on ion drive 
experiments. On Earth the project 
is headed by General BRADY, 
During the first few days of the 
voyage McCULLOUGH is worried 
about the psychological effects of liv- 
ing continually within inches of his 
two companions for a year or more, 
not to mention the loneliness and 
boredom of such an extended trip in 
space. But he soon discovers that 
the series of lectures — they are sub- 
jected to three or four per day, fol- 
lowed by searching oral examinations 
— designed to prepare them for the 
widest possible contact with the aliens 
leaves them no time to feel lonely 
or bored, BERRYMAN and WAL- 
TERS help him over his occasional 
bad spots until he is able to adjust 
to P-ship conditions. 

On P-One the atmosphere is not 
quite so happy, however. At the re- 
quest of MORRISON, McCul- 
lough undertakes an extended 
period of EVA involving a fifty- 
mile trip to the other ship in order 
to treat the physicist HOLLIS, who 
is suffering from a very painful and 
unsightly skin condition, 

McCullough becomes disori- 
ented during the trip across and is 
almost lost. When he discovers that 
HOLLIS* trouble is mainly psycho- 
somatic and self-inflicted, due in part 
to the behavior of MORRISON and 



116 



IF 




DREW, he becomes very angry with 
all three of them but manages to 
conceal it. By the generous applica- 
tion of lanolin cream and some very 
rule-of-thumb psychology he is able 
to straighten out the situation on P- 
One, but he is very glad to return 
to the relaxed and relatively happy 
atmosphere of his own ship. 

During their final approach to the 
alien vessel a few weeks later every- 
thing they do and see is relayed to 
Prometheus Control, who in turn re- 
lays it to the radio networks of the 
whole world. Practically every adult 
member of the human race is listen- 
ing for the results of this first con- 
tact, and excitement is intense. Gen- 
eral BRADY tries to direct opera- 
tions from Earth, but because of the 
radio time-lag and the various politi- 
cal pressures being brought to bear 
on him regarding contact procedure, 
his instructions are confused and self- 
contradictory. 

The men in the P-ships, however, 
have no need to be reminded of the 
importance of what they are about 
do or of the necessity for caution. 
They have already discussed contact 
procedure among themselves in great 
detail. Their approach to the Ship 
is slow and open; they advertise their 
presence by radio signals and flares, 
and they continue in this fashion for 
the best part of a day until MORRI- 
SON, realizing that the aliens either 
won't or can't reply to their signals, 
orders McCULLOUGH and WAL- 
TERS to board the Ship. 

Entrance is effected through a per- 
sonnel lock set into what appears to 
be a large cargo hatch — after first 
opening and closing the seal scores 



of times to acquaint the alien crew 
of their presence. During their 
subsequent investigation of the lock 
chamber WALTERS and McCUL- 
LOUGH are able to ignore the worry- 
ing out loud being done by BRADY 
and Control and even to forget the 
countless millions of listeners hanging 
on their every word. For the lock 
chamber's lighting, manual controls 
and fittings gives valuable data on 
the visual range, manipulatory ap- 
pendages and technical capability of 
the aliens and their planet of origin. 

In the hope of gathering samples 
of the aliens' atmosphere they se- 
cure permission from MORRISON 
to close the lock's outer seal and ob- 
tain air samples from the adjoining 
empty corridor. The alien crew — 
the two men have begun to doubt 
whether the Ship has a crew! — con- 
tinues to ignore them. Closing the 
outer seal causes them to lose radio 
contact with the P-ships. WALTERS 
is about to investigate the corridor 
when a dimly seen, alien something 
makes a vicious attack on him 
and slashes his spacesuit. McCUL- 
LOUGH helps him back to the safety 
of the lock chamber, but discovers 
that the Ship atmosphere is at a 
higher pressure than their suit air 
pressure, and it is forcing its way 
inside, 

WALTERS begins to cough. 



IX 

44T feel an awful fool,” said Mc- 
A CuUough, looking apologetical- 
ly at Walters. “I should have re- 
alized it in the Ship. At very least 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



117 




I should have suspected it when I 
examined him here.” 

^'Granted that changing suits in 
the corridor would have been easier 
on Walterfs throat and eyes, I doubt 
if you would have been allowed to 
complete the operation when the 
aliens arrived. So you have nothing 
to reproach yourself with, and those 
photographs you took .... Well, 
altogether it was a very nice job** 
“And Vm not complaining,” said 
Walteis. 

For the analysis of the air sample 
taken in the corridor had shown that 
the alien atmosphere was not harm- 
ful to human beings and was, in 
fact, much less toxic than the air 
of an average city. But the sample 
taken in the lock chamber contained 
a quantity of vaporized liquid which 
could only have come from the leak 
in the hydraulic system. Apparently 
the stuff Walters had breathed was 
about as damaging as a similar 
quantity of tear gas. 

But McCullough had conducted his 
examination of the hapless pilot as 
if he had been engaged on a slight- 
ly premature post-mortem. 

*‘Now we must decide what to 
do next. Vd like the doctor and Ma- 
jor Walters to put forward any sug- 
gestions they may have. After all, 
you two have more Ship experience 
than anyone else. How do you see 
the situation now?** 

“I can’t see anything,” Walters 
said hoarsely. “My throat is too 
sore.” 

There was an irritated, over- 
amplified sigh from the speaker 
grill. McCullough nodded quickly to 
Walters, then began to speak. 



S o far as he was concerned the trip 
inside the alien vessel had not 
answered any of the major questions 
regarding its ori^ and purpose. It 
remained a hulking brute of a ship 
nearly half a mile long, orbiting the 
Sun at a distance of one hundred 
and sixty million miles, seemingly in 
a powered-down condition, and refus- 
ing to acknowledge all signals. The 
precision with which it had been in- 
serted into orbit, together with the 
reactions of what must have been a 
damage control party of its crew, 
seemed to rule out the earlier theory 
that the Ship was in a derelict or 
distressed condition. 

Present indications were that it was 
deliberately refusing contact because 
it was here merely to conduct a sur- 
vey of some description. Perhaps they 
did not want contact with an inferior 
race or had orders forbidding such 
contact. McCullough was very care- 
ful to use the word “survey” rather 
than “reconnaissance,” but he was 
afraid the people at home would 
jump to conclusions no matter which 
word he used. 

So far as the physical structure 
of the Ship was concerned, photo- 
graphic and other observations made 
it clear that it had not been design- 
ed to withstand massive accelerations 
or even a take-off from an average 
planet. However, if the netting they 
had observed covered all the corri- 
dors in the ship, it was unlikely that 
they had gravity control either inside 
the ship or as a means of propulsion. 
Since there were no rocket venturis 
or any other visible signs of conven- 
tional reaction propulsion capable of 
moving such a massive vessel, it 



118 



IF 




seemed obvious that whatever method 
of propulsion was being used the 
ship remained in the weightless con- 
dition whether it was under power 
or not. 

Where the crew of the alien ship 
was concerned they had a little more 
to go on. 

“In addition to the physiological 
details in the photographs,” McCul- 
lough went on, “which will tell us a 
lot when we have a chance to study 
them properly, we know that the 
crew is composed of three distinct 
species. The alien with the white fur 
or clothing seemed to be in a posi- 
tion of authority or influence over 
the others. Even though their curiosi- 
ty regarding us must have been in- 
tense, the others left the area as 
soon as type Three appeared.” 

McCullough went on. “The sec- 
ond type, which we encountered first 
when Walters was attacked, is much 
more aggressive or impulsive than 
Type Three. As I see it, the Three 
is their equivalent of an officer while 
the Twos are a damage control party 
of crew members who were angered 
by the damage to their lock’s hy- 
draulic system and expressed their 
anger by taking a swipe at Walters. 
But if we assume that their orders 
were to ignore us and let the repairs 
wait until after we had gone away, 
and the Type Three arrived on the 
scene to remind the others of their 
orders in no uncertain terms and 
chase them off . 

“They followed the Three,” Wal- 
ters put in. “It didn’t chase them.” 

“I don’t think that matters,” said 
McCullough, then continued: “Tak- 
ing a swipe at one of us is, in the 



circumstances, an understandable re- 
action. It is not a friendly reaction, 
of course, but it does show that we 
have certain emotional responses in 
common which could form a basis 
for a wider understanding in time — 
if we are allowed to maintain con- 
tact with them. 

“I, personally, do not think we 
will be. 

“For there can be no doubt that 
they know we are here,” McCullough 
ended seriously. “Perhaps they have 
known about us from the moment we 
left Earth. But we are not welcome 
here and we should leave before they 
take more positive steps to discourage 
us.” 

F or a long time there was silence, 
then Berryman said, “Surely 
we’ve come too far to just turn and 
run. We can investigate and photo- 
graph those hyperdrive blisters, or 
whatever they are, without actually 
entering the Ship. I agree it is good 
sense to run away. But make it to- 
morrow or sometime next week.” 
“/.../ agree,** said Hollis from 
P-One. The over-amplification which 
made the colonel’s voice sound 
authoritive simply magnified the 
physicist’s timidity. ** Accurate photo- 
graphs of those generators — which 
must be connected with their propul- 
sion system — might not give us 
everything we want to know, but they 
would at least keep our people from 
following too many useless avenues 
of research. 

**At the same time I agree with 
the doctor. We should not go into the 
ship again if we aren*t welcome.** 
There came a sound of Morrison’s 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



119 




throat being cleared, and Hollis 
broke off. Obviously the colonel was 
willing for the other to speak so 
long as he said the right things. Talk- 
ing about leaving was not one of the 
right things, so it was equally ob- 
vious that the colonel also wanted to 
stay. 

Walters found his voice suddenly 
and said, “We made a mistake by 
damaging their lock mechanism, but 
that doesn’t necessarily mean they 
will chase us away like small boys 
caught robbing an orchard! That 
would be too . too petty an act 
for a race capable of interstellar 
flight.” 

“I’d like to think so, too,” Mc- 
Cullough said sharply. “But I keep 
remembering the petty things we did 
in the sailing ship and stagecoach 
era and how many of us are still 
doing them.” 

“But we’re unarmedl” Berryman 
broke in. “Our ships are downright 
primitive by their standards. And in 
a sense we belong to the same club. 
Space travel is not as dangerous for 
them as for us, of course, but . .” 

“But you feel,” McCullough fin- 
ished for him, with a sarcastic edge 
to his voice, “that the alien captain 
should pipe the plucky primitives 
aboard with full honors. Don’t you 
think it possible that this sort of 
thing may have happened many times 
to this particular ship? Maybe they 
are a little tired of primitives busting 
a gut to get out to look over their 
ships. So much so, perhaps, that they 
w on’t even toss a metaphorical coin 
into the water to see us do tricks 
for them because of the danger of us 
fouling their metaphorical propellers.” 



“Walters’s idea of the alien might 
be too noble,” Berryman protested, 
“but yours is too base and cynical. 
This isn’t like you. Doctor.” 

“No, indeed,” said Walters, stifling 
a cough. “And aren’t we forgetting 
that practically all of this is sheer 
guesswork? They might not be noble 
or base. They might not even be all 
that far advanced technically, judging 
by their ship’s construction. And I 
don’t think we should run away until 
we at least know what we are run- 
ning away from. 

“As for the doctor,” he ended 
bitingly, “I think the blood circula- 
tion to his feet is beginning to fail. 
They are growing quite cold.” 

“/ asked for your views on the 
present situation^ not about each 
other. Calm down, gentlemen. We 
are not going to leave, not immedi^ 
ately and not even next week. It 
seems Control has been keeping us 
in the dark — for our peace of mind, 
they say — about certain new de- 
velopments which make it necessary 
for us to stay put. The period men- 
tioned was a minimum of three weeks, 
**You see, our people were a little 
late in cutting the transmission to the 
networks when things became excit- 
ing at the ship, and the political side- 
effects have yet to be evaluated. At 
the present time I am receiving new, 
modified, amended or downright con- 
tradictory orders on an average of 
three times a day.** 

The incident on the Ship had gone 
out in its entirety, via translators 
or commentators where non-English 
speaking nations were concerned, to 
practically everyone on Earth. Pro- 
metheus had wanted to cut transmis-

sion, but a quite incredible amount 
of pressure had been brought to bear 
on them to continue relaying the sig- 
nals from the Alien — it was 
ready being capitalized and used in 
";he same sentences with words like 
Invader and Enemy — and so far 
as the colonel knew they would still 
receive everything he sent. He had 
used his discretion, however, regard- 
ing the signals recently received from 
P-Two. 

Already there was talk of trebling 
NASA’s appropriation, building an 
armada, knitting warm sweaters — 
public reaction was fluid and still 
somewhat confused, but the general 
feeling was that something positive 
should be done. It was being suggest- 
ed that the US and Russia pool their 
space capability against the common 
enemy. 

**The Russians would already be 
out here with us if they hadn't jump- 
ed the gun by launching that rather 
ambitious manned Venus Orbiting 
Station just before the Ship appeared. 
Their present capability may be 
stretched to the limit keeping it sup- 
plied. However, if our stay out here 
becomes extended, Biakonur have of- 
fered Prometheus the use of two of 
their high-acceleration supply ve- 
hicles, with no strings attached other 
than that they must not, be used to 
carry weapons. 

*'You will appreciate the poltical 
implications which have grown out 
of our handling of this situation — 
cur bungled handling of the first 
contact, some say. The UN is being 
quite critical. 

**But now we must try to devise 
tactics to cover this situation. You 



are all free to interrupt and offer 
suggestions at any time.” 

T he first interruption came within 
seconds, from Berryman, who 
suggested very strongly that it would 
be a criminal waste of opportunity 
to run away without trying to find 
out a little more about alien science 
and, if possible, culture, adding that 
any tactics used against the aliens 
must be purely defensive. Hollis, Wal- 
ters and McCullough interrupted to 
agree with this, and Drew said that 
considering the relative sizes of the 
vessels concerned they had no choice. 

Irritated, Morrison replied that he 
had no intention of declaring war on 
anybody, and would they all please 
make their suggestions more construc- 
tive and less general in nature. 

Finally it was decided that P-One 
and P-Two would be joined together 
nose-to-nose. There was provision for 
doing this in design, and the result 
would be that Walters would have 
access to both command modules 
without having to don a spacesuit. 
There would also be a saving in 
power by having one life-support sys- 
tem serve two ships, since it might 
come about that the other men would 
be absent on the alien Ship for ex- 
tended periods of time. The duties 
of this single watch-keeping officer 
would be to maintain contact with the 
men investigating the alien vessel and 
Prometheus Control and report prog- 
ress. 

Drew had a lot to say on the sub- 
ject of defensive weapons. They had 
no intention of hurting, much less 
killing, anyone on the alien ship. But 
if they did re-enter the vessel they 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



121 




would have to have a means of pro- 
tecting themselves and their irreplac- 
able spacesuits from injury. With the 
aid of the doctor’s as yet incomplete 
physiological data on the known 
alien life-forms they devised and built 
a prototype weapon, rather like a ski- 
stick, which would fend off aliens 
and prick them lightly if they be- 
came too persistent. 

They discussed alien motivation 
and possible methods of communi- 
cation at great length, and somehow 
it became an accepted, although not 
formally agreed, fact that they would 
go aboard the alien ship again. 

Many hours later while they were 
closing with P-One for the docking 
operation, Walters said hoarsely, “I’m 
sorry for what I said back there, Doc- 
tor. I should not have criticized your 
feet, not after what you did for me 
on the Ship. But you put up such a 
good, sensible case for leaving I 
thought the colonel might decide 
there and then to do just that, and 
this is such a unique opportunity for 
... for ... .” 

“Getting clobbered?” Berryman 
asked, grinning. He went on, “But I 
wouldn’t apologize, Walters, if I were 
you. It seems to me that if your mind 
was capable of reaUy devious think- 
ing, and if you weren’t just an am- 
ateur psychologist, you would have 
realized by now that he was indulg- 
ing in a piece of psychological 
sleight-of-hand. Probably he had it 
all worked out with the colonel in ad- 
vance — talking good, sound com- 
mon sense, verbalizing all our own 
secret fears and survival instincts, 
then making us argue against them 
to show how superior we thought we 



were to him. In short, and to mix a 
metaphor slightly, propping up our 
weakening resolve with an obviously 
broken reed. 

“Not that he is likely to admit 
any of this, of course.” 

They were both staring at him. 

McCullough felt his face burning, 
but deep inside him there was an- 
other and much more pleasant feel- 
ing of warmth. It occurred to him 
suddenly that there were none so 
blind as those who could see per- 
fectly, but shut their eyes because 
they happened to be looking at a 
friend. 

“It’s a thought,” said McCullough. 
To himself he added, A happy after- 
thought. 

X 

A s the only member of the expe- 
dition with both a spacesuit and 
first-hand alien experience, McCul- 
lough was placed in charge of the 
second boarding party. Those were 
the reasons given by Morrison and, 
without actually saying so, the others 
gave McCullough the impression that 
they considered it a sensible arrange- 
ment. 

Five minutes after leaving the P- 
ships, however, Morrison was no 
longer even pretending that McCul- 
lough was in charge. 

The entry point chosen was a per- 
sonnel lock about one hundred yards 
aft of the first one. McCullough 
operated the seal mechanism and en- 
tered, followed by the colonel, Berry- 
man, Hollis and Drew. This time he 
did not slam the door or test the hy- 
draulic actuator to destruction. In-

IF 




side he demonstrated the working of 
the light switches. The chamber dif- 
fered only in detail from the pre- 
vious one, but this time they were 
going to examine the fine details. 

There were no aliens in the lock 
chamber or in the corridor outside. 

Morrison had brought a spotlight 
from P-One. Using the access doors 
on four sides of the chamber and the 
large transparent panels set into 
them he snapped the space between 
the Ship’s double hull while Drew 
kept watch on the corridor and re- 
ported progress to Walters on P-Two. 
Berryman, Hollis and McCullough 
scoured the place for identification 
numbers. 

realize,” said Berryman during 
the first few minutes of the examina- 
tion, “that robust construction to- 
gether with simplicity of design is 
supposed to reduce the danger of 
component failure, but this angle 
bracket is so simple it is downright 
crude!” 

But the badly finished support 
bracket, like all the other small 
structural members they were ex- 
amining, possessed the expected sym- 
bols of identification. 

Their idea was simply that any 
piece of machinery beyond a certain 
degree of complexity — from a car or 
light airplane up to and including 
spaceships half a mile long — re- 
quired an enormous amount of prior 
design work, planning and tooling 
long before the first simple parts and 
sub-assemblies became three-dimen- 
sional metal on someone’s workbench. 
The number of general assembly and 
detail drawings, material specification 
charts, wiring diagrams and so on 



for a vessel of this size must have 
been mind-staggering, and the pur- 
pose of all this paperwork was sim- 
ply to instruct people of average in- 
telligence in the manufacture and fit- 
ting together the parts of this gigan- 
tic three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle. 

If normal human practice was ob- 
served, and the aircraft engineers who 
had lectured them on the trip out in- 
sisted that there was no easier way 
short of waving a magic wand, then 
these drawings together with the com- 
ponents they described must include 
exact instructions for the placing of 
these parts within the jigsaw. 

It was possible that the aliens 
had some exotic method of identifying 
components — such as impressing 
each part with a telepathic identity 
tag or tactile coding systems instead 
of using visible printed symbols. But 
considering the size of the project 
and the tremendous number of parts 
to be identified they were fairly sure 
that the aliens would do it the easy 
way, which was to mark the surface 
material of the component with sym- 
bols which could be read at a glance. 

The system used on the Ship 
seemed to be some kind of vibro- 
etch technique. It was nice to know 
that, in the philosophy of aircraft 
and spaceship construction at least, 
the e-ts and humans thought alike. 

“You notice there are no curved 
lines in these symbols,” said Hollis 
at one point. “The result of having 
pincers instead of fingers and an 
opposable thumb, would you say?” 

“Not necessarily,” said McCul- 
lough. “If we had continued to use 
Roman instead of Arabic numer- 
als

“Discuss your findings later, gen- 
tlemen,” said Morrison impatiently. 
“We will take a quick look along 
the corridor. Berryman and I will 
move aft, Hollis and McCullough 
forward, and Drew will guard the lock 
chamber. Go only as far as the first 
intersection — that should make it im- 
possible for any of us to be cut 
off. Make a map showing door po- 
sitions and anything else of interest. 
If the doors have transparent pan- 
els, sketch in room dimensions and 
contents. 

“Be as quick as you can,” he 
ended. “If you meet anything, re- 
treat or defend yourselves without 
hurting it. All right, Drew, crack the 
seal.” 

T hey split up as directed, McCul- 
lough keeping slightly ahead of 
Hollis so as not to prod him with 
his ridiculous weapon. Since the Ship 
seemed to be designed for free-fall 
conditions there was no clearly de- 
fined floor, ceiling or walls in the 
corridor. The netting was supported a 
few inches out from each wall and 
stretched taut and was interrupted at 
regular intervals by the entrances to 
what seemed to be storerooms. Being 
cautious men, they shone their lights 
only into the rooms whose doors had 
transparent panels in them and left 
the others alone even though they 
would have opened at a touch — 
they were simple, sliding doors rather 
than pressure seals. Every door bore 
two sets of identifying symbols placed 
upside down to each other so as to 
be easily read whatever the direction 
of approach. 

Lifting fixtures and switches were 



set at intervals along the corridor, but 
McCullough did not turn them on. 
The torches of Hollis and himself 
gave enough light at short range and 
there was no point in letting the 
aliens in their control-room know 
that the humans had moved into the 
corridor. 

At the intersection one corridor 
continued forward while another 
curved away in each direction, follow- 
ing the lateral curvature of the hull 
so that they could see only twenty 
yards or so along it. Just at the limit 
of vision in each branch there were 
the mouths of two other corridors 
paralleling their own. 

“If we went back along one of 
them,” said Hollis, pointing, “and 
then took the first outboard turning, 
we should meet up with the colonel 
and Berryman.” 

“Do you want to try it?” said Mc- 
Cullough. 

“No,” said Hollis. 

The physicist busied himself with 
his sketch pad while McCullough 
kept watch in four directions. But 
they were not disturbed by anything 
until the colonel’s voice ordered them 
back to the lock chamber. 

Ten minutes later they were out- 
side the Ship again and heading for 
a lock close to one of the big trans- 
parent blisters. Hollis was literally 
babbling with excitement over the 
prospect of tinkering with a real live 
— Walters on P-Two warned that 
it was probably several million volts 
live — hyperspatial generator. Mc- 
Cullough said nothing and thought 
seriously about Colonel Morrison’s 
voice. 

Morrison had the irritating habit 

IF 



124 




of using too much volume during 
transmission and sounding like a 
short-tempered hurler of thunderbolts 
rather th^ the simple voice of au- 
thority. But now the doctor was be- 
ginning to wonder if the over-ampli- 
fication and, perhaps, the judicious 
use of the tone control to make it 
sound deeper as well as louder, was 
the sole reason for Morrison’s stern- 
sounding, authoritive tone. Certainly 
the difference in his natural and 
radio voice was amazing. McCullough 
had the uncomfortable feeling that 
every time the colonel opened his 
mouth in ordinary face-to-face con- 
versation he nibbled away a little 
of his own authority. 

It was becoming obvious that the 
Colonel Morrison who Berryman, 
Walters and himself knew as a voice 
from P-One was not necessarily the 
same person that Drew and Hollis 
knew on the colonel’s own ship. It was 
becoming much easier to believe 
Morrison capable of gossiping like 
an old woman to Drew while ex- 
cluding Hollis and allowing the physi- 
cist to get into the sorry state Mc- 
Cullough had found him in when he 
was shot across to the other ship. 

At the same time McCullough 
knew that he must guard against 
a too-sudden reversal of feeling. One 
unexpected weakness — especially in 
an area so susceptible to misinterpre- 
tation as a tone of voice — did not 
mean that the colonel was auto- 
matically weak, ineffectual and un- 
suited to wield authority and had, 
therefore, no right to their obedience. 

McCullough worried about the 
colonel all the way to their next 
point of entry. 



This time they stayed only a few 
minutes in the lock chamber and did 
not go into the corridor at all. 
Access to the space between outer 
and inner hulls was by a simple, un- 
pressurized sliding door, and the air 
on the other side of it was at corridor 
pressure. Masses of cable conduits, 
plumbing and enigmatic cabinets 
sprouted among a forest of girders on 
all sides, except where a narrow lad- 
der of netting stretched forward 
through a tunnel cleared in the 
metallic jungle. At the other end of 
the ladder the colonel’s splotlight 
showed the entrance, if their calcula- 
tions were correct, to one of the 
blisters. 

“Use our own lighting,” Morrison 
said, “and don’t wander away from 
the net. We might accidentally short- 
circuit something and kill ourselves.” 

“I don’t think so, sir,” said Berry- 
man, “The cables all seem to be 
well insulated.” 

“I agree,” said Hollis, “but we 
should examine the markings on 
cables entering the blister to help us 
separate lighting and instrumentation 
circuits from power lines.” 

“Be careful anyway!” said the 
colonel sharply. “Drew, guard the 
lock chamber. The rest of you follow 
me.” 

Two days ago Berryman might 
have argued against the colonel like 
that, McCullough thought, but not 
HoUis. 

T he atmosphere remained tense 
until they entered the blister 
through an airlock. Inside they 
found no atmosphere at all. This did 
not surprise, Hollis, who said that he 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



125 




had expected the generators to oper- 
ate in a vacuum. A few minutes later 
they discovered that the vacuum was 
maintained by having the blister open 
to space, although the openings in 
the transparent canopy were too nar- 
row to allow passage to a man or, 
McCullough suspected, an alien. Sun- 
light flooded through the transparent 
plastic, throwing dazzling highlights 
off the bare metal and pale blue 
ceramics all around them. The two 
P-ships were clearly visible in the 
black sky and the canopy was no 
barrier to communications. 

“There are bare power lines in 
this room,” said the colonel stiffly, 
“so be careful.” 

“Yes, sir,” said Hollis quickly. 
“But I don’t think there will be any 
danger from them — the generator 
isn’t switched on. At the same time, 
it will take weeks to study this place 
properly and I should like to make 
absolutely sure of our safety while 
doing so.” 

His idea was to short the power 
lines where they entered the blister. 
He was fairly sure that the genera- 
tor’s design incorporated protective 
fusing and similar fail-safe devices so 
that the valuable generator itself 
would not be destroyed. If he was 
building the thing, that was how Hol- 
lis would do it. There was perhaps 
no need for him to point out that 
this intricate piece of equipment was 
not a crudely built structure — it 
looked as if it had been put together 
by watchmakers. 

It was also possible that the genera- 
tor would not operate if foreign 
bodies, themselves, were present in 
the blister. At the same time Hollis 



said he would feel much more com- 
fortable investigating the place when 
he was less likely at any moment 
to be struck by alien lightning. 

“You’re the physicist,” said the 
colonel. “But it occurs to me that 
spiking one of their generators will 
make them feel annoyed. Even more 
annoyed than slamming an airlock 
door!” 

Instead of netting, a light plastic 
ladder arrangement curved around 
and through the masses of equipment 
projecting into the blister, twisting 
and widening out into an outsize ten- 
nis-racket shape where it was ob- 
vious that more than one alien was 
meant to work on it. Hollis did not 
talk during the investigation except 
for the single occasion when he told 
McCullough with great fervor that 
his camera contained the most valu- 
able pictures ever taken. 

But McCullough was only half 
listening to him. He had the feeling 
that they were all being too enthusias- 
tic, not worrying nearly enough about 
the people of the Ship and what they 
would think of all this, and generally 
tending to forget where they were. 
Maybe they wanted to forget where 
they were, of course, and the en- 
thusiasm and lack of proper thought 
were aids to accomplishing this. But 
McCullough had the awful feeling 
that they should all stop and have a 
good, long think. 

He wished Morrison would take a 
firm grip on the situation and make 
them stop and think! 

The colonel’s last remark had 
brought back to his mind the name 
of the old-time author responsible 
for a story called First Contact, He 



126 



IF 




had also written one entitled The 
Ethical Equations and, during the 
trip out they had talked over these 
and a great many other fictional 
first contacts — science-fictional 
data being the only kind available to 
them — and the ethical equations had 
been very thoroughly discussed. 

They had all gained, McCullough 
now realized, much comfort from 
them. 

In substance the equations stated 
that if one did a person or alien a 
good turn an equal reward would ulti- 
mately be forthcoming, and that the 
same would apply if someone did 
something wrong. Eventually an ex- 
act balance of punishment or re- 
ward would occur. Assuming then 
that the crew of the alien Ship did, 
after their own fashion, subscribe to 
this ethic, what had the human 
boarding party done that was in- 
herently, basically wrong? 

They were guilty of blundering in- 
to a situation which they did not un- 
derstand. They had damaged alien 
property and they were guilty of tres- 
pass. TTieir intentions had not been 
evil, of course, but that fact would 
not be apparent to the aliens. How- 
ever, an intelligent extraterrestrial 
species capable of crossing interstellar 
space should possess enough under- 
standing or empathy to credit an- 
other intelligent species with the 
normal amount of scientific curiosity, 
and the sins of trespass and minor 
property damage were venial to say 
the least. 

B ut in the deeper recesses of his 
brain, in the levels of mind 
which operated on hunches and guess- 



work and insufficient data, McCul- 
lough refused to be reassured or even 
comforted. To the contrary his fear 
mounted steadily with every hour 
which passed. And when Walters’s 
voice sounded suddenly in his phones 
he started so violently that he almost 
lost his camera. 

**Sirr said the pilot. ''Drew re- 
ports activity in the corridor outside 
his position. Five Type Twos along 
the corridor in the direction of your 
blister. He had the lock chamber 
lights switched on and saw them clear- 
ly, though they didn't see him." 

“Everybody out!” said the colonel. 
“Hurry it up! We’ll go back the way 
we came, avoiding the corridor. I . 
I don’t think we should attempt a 
formal contact just yet . .” 

"He also says there is something 
like a Type One in the inter-hull 
space, clinging to the netting.” 

“We’ll ignore it,” said Morrison, 
“and hope it does the same. Hollis, 
move!” 

They went through the blister lock 
and along the net, with Morrison 
leading, Hollis and McCullough fac- 
ing each other on opposite sides of the 
netting and Berryman bringing up the 
rear. They pulled themselves hand 
over hand towards Drew and the 
opened lock chamber while their eyes 
searched the dark spaces between the 
cabinets and masses of plumbing on 
all sides of them. 

“Doctor!” 

Morrison’s spotlight had picked out 
a small, bristling alien, something 
like a Siamese twin porcupine, which 
was flip-flopping along the net away 
from them. McCullough still could 
not see what it used for hands. 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



127 




“Got it,” he said, replacing his 
camera and hurrying on. 

Drew had taken up a classic de- 
fensive position outside the open 
door, crouching with one leg hooked 
into the net to steady himself. The 
shaft of his ski-stick was wedged 
against the wall plating with the busi- 
ness end pointing back the way they 
had come. A little self-consciously 
Morrison took up a similar position 
on the other side of the opening tmd 
waved the others through. 

McCullough entered first, then 
Hollis. They turned to assist Berryman 
then and had a hand under each 
armpit when it happened. 

His radio went into a howl of 
oscillation as four voices tried to 
use it at the same time, and Mc- 
Cullough saw aliens swarming 
towards them out of the dark spaces 
between the supposedly solid masses 
of equipment. Morrison and Drew he 
could not see at all. The colonel had 
lost his spotlight, and Berryman was 
being pulled away from them. 

One of the aliens had anchored it- 
self to the combing with two of its 
tentacles while the other two were 
wrapped around the pilot’s feet. An- 
other e-t had swarmed onto his back, 
its sting jabbing furiously — Mc- 
Cullough could hear it clanking 
against Berryman’s air tanks. He 
knew that it had only to shift its 
position by a few inches for the pilot 
to be very horribly dead.

could do nothing except stare in 
fascination at the colonel’s spotlight

as it was sent spinning to and fro by 
the struggling^ colliding bodies around 
the entrance. Lit by that wildly ro- 
tating beam» the scene took on the 
flickering, unreal quality of an old- 
time silent film. The spotlight was 
blinding and confusing the men as 
much as the aliens, because it was 
some time before McCullough re- 
alized that Beiryn^ had freed one 
foot and was using it to kick at the 
tentacle holding the other — he had 
been viewing the operation as a se- 
ries of disconnected stills. 

Hollis was mouthing at him — 
the suit radio still emitted a con- 
stant howl of oscillation because too 
many people were trying to use it 
at the same time — and pointing at 
the wall net. The physicist was on 
his knees beside the sliding door 
and had worked his feet and lower 
legs between the net and the wall. 
McCullough got the idea and did 
the same, and together they took a 
firm, two-handed grip on each of 
Berryman’s arms and pulled hard. 

Berryman came free of the first 
alien so suddenly that his visor 
cracked against the edge of the open- 
ing, and the force of the pull sent 
him shooting past so quickly that 
they had to grab his feet. The sec- 
ond alien was still clinging to his 
back, still stabbing at his air tanks. 

A pair of legs were coming 
through the opening. McCullough 
gave one of them a tug to help who- 
ever it was on their way. There were 
long tears in the fabric covering one 
leg, and blood was oozing out of one 
of them. 

The constant howling made it dif- 
ficult to think. 

129 




They pulled Berryman down be- 
tween them, hooked his legs into 
the netting, then concentrated their 
efforts on the alien clinging to his 
back. Its tentacles were still wrapped 
tightly around the pilot’s chest, and 
Hollis pushed the butt of a ski-stick 
between the alien’s underbelly and 
Berryman’s back and tried to lever it 
away. The alien jerked violently — 
he must have prodded a sensitive area 
— but did not let go. Then McCul- 
lough discovered the answer. If they 
reached under Berryman’s chest and 
gripped the tentacles by their tips 
they could be peeled back relatively 
easily. 

There was a muffled clang. Mc- 
Cullough looked round quickly and 
saw that everyone was inside. Drew 
was slotting his weapon into the pip- 
ing which ran along both sides of 
the sliding door and through the 
ring handle so as to form a bar. Pos- 
sibly the aliens could open it, but 
not without tearing out a chunk of 
their hydraulic system. 

The howling in his earphones was 
beginning to break into fragments of 
words and sentences. 

“. My suit’s torn. I’m losing 

air Get it off me! Get it off ... 

Shut up, all of you, and .... Stop 
it wriggling or it will stab .... My 
leg, dammit, where’s the doctor? Off 
your radio and open your visors .... 
Quiet, and open your helmets . .!” 

McCullough kept quiet as ordered, 
realizing suddenly that he himself 
had been contributing as much as 
everyone else to the uproar. But he 
did not open his visors because his 
hands were full of alien tentacles. 

For the few minutes it took to pull 



the twisting, heaving body off Berry- 
man’s back, McCullough had a really 
close look at the alien. There was a 
shallow recess between the roots of 
its tentacles, set so low as to be al- 
most on the edge of its underbelly, 
and in it there was the soft, wet gleam 
of something which could only be an 
eye. The opening and closing me- 
chanism seemed to be a double- 
lid arrangement operating vertically 
rather than horizontally and the eye 
was quite definitely looking at him. 
The ends of its tentacles quivered as 
they tried to pull away, and for some 
odd reason McCullough was remind- 
ed of the big, stupid, friendly dog 
he had had once and of the time 
he had tried to teach it to shake 
hands. 

But this creature certainly was not 
friendly — at least, not as human 
beings understood the word — and 
neither was it stupid. Unless .... 

He was unable to finish the thought 
because Berryman had wriggled from 
beneath the alien and the creature 
was bouncing up and down between 
them as it tried furiously to curl and 
then uncurl its tentacles. Berryman 
snatched a weapon which was floating 
nearby and slid it under the being. 
He pushed it away as Hollis and 
McCullough let go, and the alien went 
spinning helplessly into the center of 
the chamber. 

‘‘But I wanted to put it with its 
friends in the corridor,” said Hollis 
when he had his visor open. “In 
here, outnumbered five to one, it 
might panic and injure itself — ” 

“Are you sure this air is breath- 
able?” Berryman broke in, speaking 
through his smashed visor. There was 



130 



IF 




a long incised wound across his nose 
and one cheek. 

“Doctor,” said the colonel. “Have 
a look at Drew’s leg. And my shoul- 
der .. .” 

** Hollis! Behind you!” 

T he alien had made contact with 
the wall net, steadied itself and 
then launched itself furiously towards 
the physicist. Berryman got his ski- 
stick up in time and the alien struck 
it squarely but did not stop. The butt 
of the weapon was driven back 
against the wall, but still the being 
did not stop. The metal collar piece 
holding the plate which kept the tip 
of the weapon from penetrating more 
than half an inch slipped backward 
along the shaft. The point, with the 
alien’s considerable velocity and iner- 
tia thrown against it, drove into its 
body until stopped by the interior of 
its carapace. 

It began to slap the shaft of the 
weapon with its tentacles, violently 
at first, then more slowly. Suddenly 
its tentacles tried to tie themselves 
in knots and it became completely 
still. 

McCullough launched himself 
towards the alien, knowing that he 
was in no danger from it now. He 
gripped one tentacle where it joined 
the body and gently withdrew the 
ski-stick. 

This was much worse than a little 
property damage or trespass. Much, 
much worse. 

For a long time nobody spoke. 
McCullough looked slowly around 
at the other four men, trying des- 
perately not to think. The spacesuits 
of Morrison, Drew and Berryman 



were torn or otherwise rendered use- 
less. The colonel and Drew were in- 
jured, perhaps seriously. And, as an 
added complication, their wound? 
might well become infected with alien 
micro-organisms — an infection 
against which their bodies could have 
no defence. In any case they should 
be moved out of his place, and 
quickly. But there were only two 
useable spacesuits, the physicist’s and 
his own. Hollis’s would fit only Hol- 
lis. McCullough’s might, at a pinch, 
fit Drew but nobody else. He was 
afraid to consider all the implica- 
tions — they were too terrible. But 
more than anything he did not want 
to think about the contorted alien 
shape he was holding and the fright- 
ful things which must surely happen 
as a result of its death. 

“Doctor,” said the colonel in a 
voice harsh with pain, “you’re sup- 
posed to know how to treat human 
beings. Leave that thing alone, it’s 
dead anyway.” 

He was glad to be able to give 
his undivided attention to the injured, 
but somehow the alien cadaver seem- 
ed always to be in sight whenever 
he looked up from a patient, and it 
became more and more difficult not 
to think about it. The blood of both 
species was the same color, a fact 
which should not have surprised him 
considering their closely similar at- 
mospheric requirements, and the 
droplets filled the compartment like 
dark, frozen rain. The absence of 
gravity, as well as making it difficult 
to control bleeding, made it com- 
pletely impossible to deal quickly 
with even a simple wound. 

Even with the patients cooperating

by being their arms or feet into the 
wall netting, and Hollis doing his best 
to held McCullough in positions while 
he treated them, it took a long time. 

Morrison was in bad shape. An 
alien had tried to fasten itself onto 
his head and chest, but the colonel 
had been able to interpose his elbow 
just in time. His forearm was a little 
longer than the full extension of the 
alien’s horn, so that while his helmet 
had been hammered into so much 
scrap metal and his shoulder and up- 
[>er arm were a mass of punctured 
: nd incised wounds, he had escaped 
with his life. Drew, apparently, had 
discarded his ski-stick in favor of his 
feet, and one leg had suffered in 
conse^juence, although the injuries 
were much lighter than the colonel’s. 
Berryman had a badly lacerated face, 
caused by running it against the edge 
of his broken visor. 

But it was the spacesuits which 
had suffered worst of all, first from 
the attacks of the aliens and now 
at the hands of McCullough. 

Cutting and extending the tears in 
the fabric of the suits, pulling back 
the plastic and metal foil and the 
tubing of the air-conditioning sys- 
tems, affected him much more deep- 
ly at times than probing and cleaning 
the wounds. If they were not already 
fatally infected the wounds would 
heal — the human body was self- 
repairing to a fantastic degree. But 
increasing the damage to a suit which 
was not reparable was to inflict a 
wound of a much more serious na- 
ture. In space the suit was much 
more than a protective skin. Wal- 
ters, who was in a position to know, 
had insisted that it was analogous to 



both womb and placenta and that 
losing it prematurely could give rise 
to a really drastic form of birth 
trauma. 

The thought of being without his 
own suit in this place was enough 
to drive McCullough to the edge of 
panic, and he hated to think of how 
the others would feel when the shock 
of their injuries wore off and they 
realized the full extent of what had 
happened to them. 

H is thoughts had taken a Freudian 
and definitely morbid turn by 
the time he had finished with them. 
He found himself staring at the dead 
body of the Two and wondering if 
any of them would see home again. 

The colonel spoke suddenly. His 
voice sounded very weak, and either 
he was not using his suit radio or 
the Two’s horn had wrecked it. He 
said, “You will have to report our . 
our predicament, Doctor. And tell 
Walters to send the technical material 
and photographs at the same time. 
Hollis will have to help you with this 
— he is the only one of us capable 
of understanding what he saw in the 
blister and passing it on. When all 
this has been done you will maintain 
continous radio contact with us until 
something has been worked out. 

“We will have to move into the 
corridor while you are leaving,” Mor- 
rison ended, launching himself slowly 
towards the inner seal, “so don’t waste 
time.” 

“It might be better if I stayed,” 
said McCullough awkwardly. “None 
of you are completely fit, and if they 
attacked again while you were in the 
corridor . .” 



132 



IF 




“I can’t risk losing another space- 
suit,” said the colonel as he checked 
his slow flight with his feet and good 
arm. “Drew will organize our de- 
fenses. He’s very good at that sort 
of thing.” 

“And the first thing we do,” said 
Drew savagely, “is take the guards 
off these stickers! Anything that 
comes at us again will get six or 
eight inches of metal in its guts in- 
stead of a harmless httle jab. Cold 
steel has a very demoralizing effect 
on human beings — that’s why 
bayonet charges have retained their 
popularity through the ages — and 
maybe — ” 

“No!” McCullough protested. 
“We’ve killed one of them already — 
by accident, of course — and we 
can’t even imagine the trouble that 
will cause. But if we start killing 
them deliberately ... I mean, we 
must all think very carefully about 
this before we make another move 
which might be misunderstood.” 

“And / think we’ve been thinking 
too much!” Drew said, his voice ris- 
ing almost to a shout. More quietly 
he went on, “If a person acts like 
a wild animal then that is how he 
should be treated! And I think we 
should dump that . that car- 
cass. The damn thing gives me the 
creeps!” 

“While quietly bleeding to death,” 
said Berryman hastily, in an obvious 
attempt to restore peace, “I have 
given serious thought to this problem. 
It seems to me that there are just 
three things we can do. The first 
is to return the body to its friends 
by leaving it in the corridor — a 
course which might very well anger 

ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



them even more. The same applies if 
we keep it in here where they may 
be able to see it through the lock 
window. Or lastly, we can hide it 
from them, with little probability of 
them ever finding it, by having the 
doctor and Hollis take it away. 

“I favor the last alternative,” 
Berryman concluded, “because, whUe 
the aliens may feel fairly certain that 
it is dead, they cannot be absolutely 
sure of this — they may assume, or 
hope, that their friend is a prisoner. 
If they do not actually see the dead 
body there might be enough doubt in 
their minds to make them proceed 
more cautiously against us.” 

“My thinking exactly,” said the 
colonel. “Take it to P-Two, Doctor, 
and find out what makes it tick.” 

“You have to know your enemy,” 
said Drew viciously, “inside and 
out.” 

“Surely you are not suggesting ” 

began McCullough aghast, then 
stopped. He was trying hard to tliink 
as they must be thinking. He had not 
had his arm and shoulder gored by 
an alien’s horn or had his leg torn 
by alien claws. He was not aware, 
not as personally and subjectively 
aware as they were, that his space- 
suit was useless, with everything 
which that fact implied. McCul- 
lough’s skin, and his even more pre- 
cious spacesuit, was still in one piece. 
He had been exposed to, but had 
not suffered, violence. 

But violence was a chain reaction 
with a positive K-factor. Once be^n 
it quickly became self-sustaining. 
From the outset it had been the 
aliens who had acted violently, or 
reacted violently, towards the hu- 

133 




mans. Now the situation had deteri- 
orated to the point where it was be- 
coming uncontrollable because both 
sides were using violence. 

If the aliens reacted violently to 
the venial sin of trespass, how might 
they react to one of their people be- 
ing murdered and dissected? 

XII 

I n the general confusion of the past 
few hours McCullough had for- 
gotten one very important fact, and 
that was the effect of explosive de- 
compression on an unprotected hu- 
man or unhuman body. As soon as it 
was exposed to space the soft, al- 
most flat underside of the e-t swelled 
like a great, lumpy football and 
burst wetly. Nothing he could have 
done in the way of a post mortam 
could have made the alien look worse 
than it did just then, and by the 
time he reached P-Two with it he 
was looking forward to investigating 
this completely strange life-form. 

But there were more urgent mat- 
ters to be attended to first. 

It was not until they had pro- 
cessed the fihn, and the pictures 
taken in the blister were on their way 
pulse by pulse to Earth, that they 
were able to fully satisfy Walters’s 
curiosity about the fight in the ship. 
And then it was only by having him 
listen while McCullough made his 
repcit to Prometheus Control. The 
physicist, meanwhile, had returned to 
the Ship with a supply of food and 
water for Morrison and the others. 

Before leaving, Hollis reminded 
them that the water he was taking 
would be permanently lost to them. 



for without the P-Ship’s reclamation 
system there was no chance of them 
being able to use it again. He apolo- 
gized for mentioning this fact but 
thought that somebody should bear 
it in mind in case they were con- 
templating a lengthy stay. 

McCullough agreed and added yet 
another unpleasant datum to his re- 
port. 

“. That is the situation in de- 
tail,” McCullough said a few min- 
utes later. “Our most urgent need 
is for spacesuits to evacuate the in- 
jured men, or if they cannot be evacu- 
ated, food and water to extend our 
staying time on the Ship until evacu- 
ation is possible. There is also the 
possibility that their wounds may be- 
come infected with alien bacteria, 
against which their bodies may have 
no defense, and they will die. How- 
ever, it seems to me that the chances 
are about even of the alien pathogens 
running rampant throughout their 
systems and killing them in a matter 
of hours or alternately, of them hav- 
ing no effect whatsoever because the 
human body is too strange and alien 
an environment for the e-t pathogens 
to survive in it. There is also the 
possibility that our antibiotics will be 
as effective against e-t infections as 
they are against — ” 

**Brady here** a voice from Con- 
trol broke in. It was a gruff, impatient 
yet concerned voice belonging to the 
person on whose shoulders the re- 
sponsibility for the Prometheus Pro- 
ject and the combined weight of eight 
stars did not rest lightly. It went on, 
**You are in a mess. Doctor, I agree. 
Have you considered moving one of 
the P-ships into the lock, taking the 



IF 




men on board in shirt-sleeve con- 
ditionSy leaving one man with a suit 
to operate the lock mechanism?’* 

“Tlie lock is too small to take a 
complete P-ship without wrecking 
it!” McCullough broke in. “Berry- 
man had that idea, too. But I’ve al- 
ready told about it at the beginning 
of my report.” 

. , If this idea isn’t workable,” 
the general was continuing, **your 
only hope is to elicit the aid of the 
alien ship’s crew in getting them out. 
Are you sure they are as aggressive 
as you say?” 

“But I’ve already told you . I” 
began McCullough, then stopped. It 
occurred to him that the distant gen- 
eral was reacting only to the first few 
sentences of the report and, as Mc- 
Cullough remembered them, they had 
not been particularly coherent. 

**Stop talking, McCullough, while 
I’m trying to . I” said the general 
irritably, then in an aside to some- 
one, '*Yes, yes. I’d forgotten the 
time lag. Now let’s see ,, , McCul- 
lough!” 

“Yes, sir,” said McCullough, out 
of sheer force of habit. Holding con- 
versation with a half-hour delay be- 
tween each line of dialogue took 
some getting used to. 

Walters, who was tuned to Berry- 
man’s suit frequency, said quietly, 
“The aliens have gone. Both corridor 
and inter-hull space are empty. 
Berryman says their wounds are pain- 
ful but so far are not unduly in- 
flamed.” 

**Since the material in your report 
is urgent and may require a quick de- 
cision at any time,” the general 
went on briskly, “/ propose listening 



with one ear to your report as it 
comes in while at the same time fill- 
ing you in on the rather delicate po- 
litical situation which is developing 
here. Colonel Morrison is aware of 
the position as of last night, fifteen 
hours ago, to you, but it has changed 
since then. It changes every time you 
open your mouth. Doctor, and I 
wish you would remember that and 
speak accordingly, 

^'Briefly, the position is this , . 

E very transmission made from the 
area of the alien Ship had been 
relayed in its entirety by all the ma- 
jor networks. The same applied to 
the pictures taken during the approach 
and examination of the first airlock 
and the shots McCullough had taken 
of the aliens. The reason for such 
widespread coverage was simple. 
Public support and Interest in space- 
flight was on the wane because of 
the tremendously expensive hardv/are 
needed — especially when pushing 
out beyond the orbit of Mars — 
and a blow-by-blow illustrated ac- 
count of the first meeting between 
humanity and an extra-terrestrial cul- 
ture should revive it if any thing 
could. But now that the meeting had 
degenerated into violence, had be- 
come literally a blow-by-blow affair, 
the idea had backfired. 

People were no longer just inter- 
ested, they were choosing sides and 
becoming fanatical. 

At first Prometheus had tried to 
wrap a security blanket around the 
whole incident, but they realized the 
uselessness of this when they were 
reminded that the P-ships’ signals 
could be received by relatively unso- 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



135 




phisticated equipment; and the stills, 
although a little more difficult, re- 
quired only a moderately sized radio 
telescope coupled to the resources of 
any large newspaper office. 

That was why McCullough was 
being urged to choose his words care- 
fully when reporting to Control. If at 
all possible he was advised to play 
down the seriousness of any given 
event or development — the people 
at Control would realize the true 
gravity of the situation and act ac- 
cordingly, he was assured — and 
at all costs avoid displays of fear 
or anger. It would be an even better 
practice if McCullough could re- 
hearse his report briefly before trans- 
mitting it so as to remove all emo- 
tionally loaded words and phrases. 

“But sir — I” began McCullough, 
then stopped. A picture of Brady 
sitting in Control drifted in front of 
his mind’s eye to be replaced by one 
of Berryman, Morrison and Drew, 
frightened and injured and hiding 
from an alien threat fifty-odd million 
miles from home, and the thought 
came to him that Brady must be 
stupid or he, McCullough, was sup- 
posed to be that way. He did not see 
liow their situation could be described 
in anything but emotionally loaded 
language without making it sound 
farcical. If someone was to die, or if 
the three men in the Ship were to 
succumb to an alien infection, how 
was he supposed to report that? As a 
spot of trouble, perhaps? Or a Bad 
Show? If the general was really 
serious in what he had said McCul- 
lough might not be allowed to re- 
port a death at aU! 

. One good point is that the 



eavesdropping is strictly one-way. 
They can hear every word you say 
but they can't pick up our messages 
to you. However, I cannot at the mo- 
ment give you detailed instructions re- 
garding your present situation. Since 
you are on the spot you must use 
your own judgment. Just be careful 
not to ... " 

While the general was talking Mc- 
Cullough became aware of another 
voice in the background — a tiny, 
harsh, nervous-sounding voice which 
fought against a constant rattle of in- 
terference. He realized suddenly that 
the voice was his own, speaking the 
words he had spoken thirty minutes 
earlier. He could even hear Brady 
interrupting him again, so that for a 
few seconds there was one McCul- 
lough and two General Bradys talk- 
ing. It struck him as being wildly 
funny and he began to laugh. 

Walters looked worriedly at him 
but remained silent. Not so the gen- 
eral. 

“. With the whole world listen- 
ing to every word you say, you must 
realize that political capital can be 
made out of the lightest, unconsidered 
word. So don't even say 'Good 
morning' without thinking about it 
first . ... " 

T he general went on to say that 
as the next officer in line of 
seniority to Colonel Morrison, Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel McCullough should 
be prepared at any time to take full 
control of the expedition. Should 
casualties occur, should McCullough 
be forced to assume command, he 
must be very careful in the matter 
of wording his reports. The general 



136 



IF 




was not suggesting that he conceal 
the fact that casualties had occurred. 
He must use his own discretion in 
this, or perhaps a simple verbal code 
could be worked out which would al- 
low the co mmuni cation of sensitive 
material. The next-of-kin had the 
right to know, naturally — but Mc- 
Cullough had no idea how each sim- 
ple incident at the Ship was being 
blown up out of all proportion by the 
news media. 

. While I don*i approve of 
the emotional frenzy they are whip- 
ping up over this, one good point 
about it is that the supplies you need 
will be forthcoming. I don*t mean to 
suggest that we would not have sent 
them anyway even if you did not 
have the support and sympathy of 
billions of people^ but if you stop to 
consider how much it will cost to send 
you just one extra spacesuit, or the 
price of even a few sips of 
water ....*' 

“If you’re really worried,” said 
McCullough sarcastically, “we might 
be able to steal water from the Ship! 
This would mean us forcing ourselves 
to overcome a certain . repugnance, 
shall we say. But have you forgotten 
that we have an aversion to using 
even a fellow astronaut’s reclaimed 
water, and for that reason the psy- 
chologists insist that our waste fluids 
are individually recycled — ” 

McCullough broke off. He was 
supposed to be careful of everything 
he said and this was, after all, one 
of the less-publicized aspects of space- 
travel .... 

His sarcasm would take just over 
sixteen minutes to reach General 
Brady and the same time for the 



other’s reaction to bounce back again. 
But it seemed suddenly as if the pro- 
ject’s Chief was telepathic and that 
thought travelled much faster than 
light because Brady went on apolo- 
getically, *We are not counting the 
pennies on this however, or even the 
millions of dollars, so there is no rea- 
son for concern over this aspect of 
the situation. Just take it easy, do 
your best and, before you open your 
mouth, remember all those listening 
millions who are ready to jump to 
wrong conclusions. 

**And now we will consider the 
matter of urgent supplies. 

These will reach you via a modi- 
fied high-acceleration probe in forty- 
one days — a five-day countdown, 
which has already started, and thirty- 
six days for the trip. We will discuss 
rendezvous procedure later. Right 
now / must tell you that the payload 
is an integral part of the vehicle and 
ask that you give urgent thought to 
its composition. Should priority be 
given to food, water, replacement 
spacesuits or weapons, and in what 
proportion? 

**No doubt you will want to talk 
about this with the men on the Ship, 
so III sign off now. Good hick to all 
of you?' 

T he general was followed by a 
McDonnell man who talked end- 
lessly about the weight and size limi- 
tations of their supply vehicle and 
the rendezvous problems. McCul- 
lough left Walters to listen to him 
while he relayed a shortened version 
of Brady’s instructions to the men in 
the Ship. He spoke to Drew because 
everyone else was asleep. Drew did 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



137 




not want to wake the colonel and 
McCullough agreed that the matter 
could wait for a few hours. But the 
mention of sleep made him pause 
for a moment to calculate how long 
it had been since he had any, and 
the immediate result of his calcula- 
tions was a jaw-wrenching yawn. He 
told Drew that Walters, Hollis and 
he now would stand radio watch in 
turn while the others caught up on 
their sleep and asked to be called 
if there was the slightest change in 
the condition of their wounds, or any 
other emergency. 

Hollis returned while he was talk- 
ing. As if his arrival was the cue a 
dry, pedantic voice replaced that of 
the McDonnell man. From the physi- 
cist’s expression McCullough knew 
that questions of a highly specialized 
and technical nature were about to be 
directed at Hollis. He wanted to avoid 
another delayed-action dialogue start- 
ing up while they were all so tired, 
so he broke in to say that they all 
needed rest and would resume con- 
tact, unless there was a sudden emer- 
gency, in twelve hours. 

To Walters and Hollis he suggested 
— McCullough did not fe^ com- 
fortable about giving orders, ^spite 
his technically superior rank — that 
they get some rest while he stood first 
watch. 

The physicist nodded and began 
struggling out of his suit prior to 
strapping in. Walters, who was al- 
ready strapped into his couch, linked 
fingers behind his neck and elaborate- 
ly closed his eyes. Shortly afterward 
the pilot was asleej) and Hollis had 
his eyes closed, pretending. He was 
scratching surreptitiously at the side 



of his neck turned away from Mc- 
Cullough. Despite himself the doc- 
tor felt his own eyes closing. 

Obviously he was going to 
need something more strenuous than 
worrying about the physicist’s men- 
tal health to keep him awake, and 
his first thought was the investigation 
of the alien cadaver. But he could 
not work here — it would be stretch- 
ing even Walters’s sense of humor 
to the breaking point if the pilot was 
to wake up to find the module filled 
with drifting alien entrails — and the 
lock where he had left the specimen 
was too cramped. The best thing 
would be for him to move to P-Two’s 
command module, which he would 
have all to himself, and use the other 
ship’s radio to listen for trouble 
developing at the bridgehead. 

After listening to Brady and Drew, 
he thought irritably, even Vtn be- 
ginning to think like a general! 

But as his examination of the 
e-t proceeded McCullough’s tiredness 
was forgotten. He had begun by as- 
suming that the alien’s vital organs, 
including its brain, would be housed 
high under the protective carapace, 
and his assumption proved correct. 
He was able to identify and isolate 
the lungs, the odd-looking muscular 
pump which was the heart and the 
mechanism of ingestion, digestion and 
excretion. At easy major steps in the 
examination he took photographs. 

There were puzzles at first, but 
one by one they were solved as he 
charted the digestive, respiratory and, 
so far as he was able with the instru- 
ments available to him, the nervous 
system. Tracing the connections to 
the eyes, ears and to the vicious 



138

XllI 



weapon projecting from its underside 
was relatively easy — the thing was 
simply a curved horn with a small 
degree of mobility and not, as he 
had at first thought, a sting. But there 
were a few puzzles which refused to 
be solved. The being’s reproductive 
system was a completely closed book 
to him. 

He still had no idea what sort of 
environment could cause a creature 
shaped as this one was to evolve, 
and there were points which bothered 
him about angles of vision and the 
degree of control the being exercised 
over all four tentacles. There was no 
evidence of specialization in any of 
the appendages. 

He wondered if ambidextrous was 
the right word to use for a being 
with four hands, but he was too 
weary to solve that puzzle as well. 
He began to tidy away the grisly 
pieces of alien which floated about 
the command module, thinking that 
he would have to waken Walters so 
that he, McCullough, would have a 
chance to sleep on his many prob- 
lems. 

But when he did go to sleep, there 
were no solutions waiting to rise out 
of his subconscious. Instead he 
dreamed only of Berryman, Morrison 
and Drew and of the nightmarish 
fates which could befall them, cul- 
minating in one which involved a 
fungus growing out of their wounds 
and spreading over their whole bodies 
until they became great, livid, mobile 
sponges which mewed and gobbled 
appealingly ^t him while they chased 
him along the bright, net-covered cor- 
ridors of the alien ship. 

That one woke him up screaming. 



S ix days went by, and none of the 
men on the Ship died or even 
became infected. Perhaps their bodies 
were too alien an environment for 
extra-terrestrial micro-organisms to 
survive in them, or it may have been 
that Earthly medication and antibio- 
tics were a match for most germs 
regardless of origin. McCullough’s 
pleasure and relief over this was in- 
tense, but the feeling was banished 
shortly afterward by his row with 
the general. 

McCullough had evolved a number 
of theories about the alien Type Two, 
but he wanted to have his conclu- 
sions regarding some of the more 
puzzling aspects of its physiology 
vetted by someone more eminent in 
the field. He prepared, and had Wal- 
ters transmit, a group of eight photo- 
graphs taken during the alien’s post- 
mortem before commencing his verbal 
report, and in the thousand-odd sec- 
onds it took for the signal to reach 
Earth and for the general’s first re- 
action to come back, he said quite a 
lot. 

Too much, obviously. 

**SilenceI Stop talking at oncer 
Brady’s voice roared at him sud- 
denly. *Tor God's sake, STOP 
TALKINGr 

But so far as the general was con- 
cerned there was nothing that could 
stop McCullough’s voice arriving for 
at least another half an hour, and 
Brady quickly realized this. He was 
still angry but his tone became al- 
most resigned as he went on, **You 
are supposed to be very careful of 
every word you say, McCullough, If 



AU JUDGMENT FLED 



139 




you do or say anything wrong, it re- 
flects on all of us. Not just on you 
people out there or on the project 
personnel, our whole country and its 
ideology suffers as a consequence! 
Don*t you realize that what you*ve 
just done will cause a storm of criti- 
cism and censure from inside as well 
as outside the country, that a large 
section of the world*s population is 
going to feel angry and ashamed of 
what you have done out there? 

**Every time you open your mouth, 
McCullough, you lose friends and 
we lose support! Think, dammit, be- 
fore you talk! 

**There are some who will be 
pleased with what you are doing,'* 
the general went on bitterly. **The 
biologists who are too interested in 
finding out what makes an alien tick 
to think of ethical and political side- 
effects. And there are the various 
groups advocating that a stronger line 
should be taken against these un- 
friendly aliens. But even you must 
be aware of how much trouble is 
caused by people who object to dis- 
section practiced on domestic animals 
and pets, and now YOU have to 
start cutting up a member of an in- 
telligent extra-terrestrial species!** 

And so it went on. 

McCullough remained silent with a 
considerable effort. A lot had happen- 
ed during the six days since the fight 
with the aliens. From Earth the first 
high-acceleration supply vehicle had 
been launched, preceded, accom- 
panied and followed by thousands 
of words of cautious advice. In 
P-Two McCullough had completed 
his examination of the alien and 
had passed his thoughts about it 



to the three men marooned on 
the Ship. His chief reason for doing 
this had been to give them something 
else to think about other than their 
wounds — wounds from which they 
had not really expected to recover. 
But now that recovery was simply 
a matter of time, it was a little em- 
barrassing for McCullough that his 
theory had been accepted in toto by 
everyone but himself. 

The reason for that, of course, was 
that it made them feel less guilty over 
some of the things they h^ done. 

But it was, after all, only a theory, 
and the facts on which it was based 
could be interpreted several ways. 
McCullough had transmitted a group 
of pictures and a number of verbal 
facts before the general had started 
having hysterics. He had not even 
mentioned his theory. Apparently 
Brady did not want to hear it. Brady 
did not want to hear anything! 

“Doctor,” said Walters in a whis- 
per. “You’ve been tapping that mike 
with your finger for the past ten 
minutes. When the general gets 
around to hearing it he will think 
something terrible is happening.” 

“Something is,” said McCullough, 
“I’m losing my patience.” 

He paused, then choosing his 
words with great care, went on. 
“Since I am forbidden to discuss my 
findings on the Type Two alien’s 
physiology, or draw conclusions from 
them or even ask questions regarding 
them from people who are more 
knowledgeable than myself, there is 
nothing more to say except this. The 
photographs and verbal report trans- 
mitted so far represent facts, and 
both my theory and the questions 



140 



IF 




arising from it are implicit in these 
facts if you bring them to the at- 
tention of the right people. Message 
ends.” 

The general was still complaining 
bitterly. McCullough tuned him down 
to a whisper and knocked off the 
transmit switch. He picked up the 
Ijength of modified tubing Walters 
and he had been working on, then 
told the pilot that he was going to 
the Ship and that he would send 
Hollis back as soon as he arrived 
there. If the general or any lesser 
light from Control wanted to hear 
from them, they should talk about 
hyperdrive generators and nothing 
else. 

H e entered the lock chamber a 
few minutes later and Hollis left 
it, closing the outer seal behind him. 
Immediately there was a rush of air 
entering from the corridor which was 
quickly followed by the three maroon- 
ed men. Even though there were no 
aliens outside the chamber, the men’s 
movements were fast, precise and 
economical — a complex, well prac- 
ticed drill. Outwardly at least they 
were adapting to conditions inside 
the Ship. Before McCullough could 
speak Drew dived towards him, 
checked himself expertly against a 
lashing point and said, “Is that the 
new weapon?” 

McCullough nodded and with ob- 
vious reluctance handed it over. 

“I know how you feel. Doctor,” 
said Drew. “You are worried about 
this new form of frightfulness you 
are about to unloose on our little 
world. But this isn’t a mass destruc- 
tion weapon. We will be discriminat- 



ing in its use and only kill aliens who 
are trying to kill us — ” 

“But they are aliens!” said McCul- 
lough angrily. “My theory could be 
completely wrong.” 

“I think not,” said Colonel Morri- 
son, joining them. “In any case we 
are badly in need of a Two-stopper, 
and it looks as if you’ve given us 
one.” 

When a Two was stabbed with one 
of the existing spears it was still 
possible for it to inflict considerable 
damage before it died, so the weapon 
had been shortened slightly so as to 
make it handle like a sword. At the 
business end the tubing had been cut 
diagonally in the manner of a hypo- 
dermic needle and the tip flattened 
and given a razor edge on both sides. 
A few inches back from the tip the 
blade curved through an angle of 
about thirty degrees so that it looked 
a little like a bull-fighter’s sword. 

The effect would be to inflict a 
deep punctured wound, after which 
the damage could be multiplied and 
compounded by giving the weapon a 
quick, semi-circular twist before tug- 
ging it free. The thought of the 
frightful internal devastation a prop- 
erly delivered thrust and twist would 
inflict on the victim’s body made Mc- 
Cullough feel physically as well as 
mentally uncomfortable. He was still 
not sure how he had become a part 
of this thing. 

Hippocrates and Aesculapius, he 
thought, would not have approved 
of his behavior in this matter. 

His only real excuse for producing 
the weapon was an unsatisfactory one 
even to himself, the fact that the 
Two’s horn was also a cruel and 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 



141 




deadly instrument of destruction. 
There was also the fact that the 
damage it would inflict on vital or- 
gans, the massive hemorrhaging it 
would cause, would paralyze the alien 
with shock and cause death within a 
few seconds, so that in a way it was 
almost humane. 

The colonel’s voice broke in on his 
thoughts, giving him a welcome 
change of mental subject. Morrison 
said. “What I really want to know 
is how much freedom of action I 
am allowed. Can we use your own 
initiative regarding the local situation 
and the problems rising out of it, or 
must all our thinking be done from 
the Cape?” 

“Our thinking is being done,” said 
McCullough with a deliberate lack 
of inflection in his voice, “by the 
Russians, the Buddhists, the United 
Nations and the Society for the Pre- 
vention of Cruelty to Animals.” 

They were all watching him very 
intently. 

Morrison’s shoulder and arm were 
still giving him pain, McCullough 
knew, and the other two were by no 
means comfortable. They had all lost 
a good deal of blood and been under 
constant strain with inadequate sleep 
since being marooned on the Ship. 
The bright blue lighting made it im- 
possible to conceal subtle changes of 
expression or variations of facial pal- 
lor. 

They were all staring at him so 
intently that the thought uppermost 
in his mind must have been plain for 
?!1 of them to see. 

I want to go home! 

“Go on, Doctor,” said Morrison 
harshly. 

142 



44T 7ery well, sir,” said Mc- 
V Cullough. “Our problem, or 
rather your problem, is this. We are 
being told what to do by people who 
do not know all the facts and who 
don’t want to be told them because 
of the effect the telling might have 
on public opinion. Their instructions 
to us, if you could call them instruc- 
tions, are so general in nature and 
so hedged around with qualifiers and 
warnings that they don’t really seem 
to mean anything. We need help. 
Not only are we not getting it, we 
are being ordered not to ask for it! 

“I, personally, would like corro- 
boration of my findings in the Two 
autospy,” McCullough went on, an- 
ger gradually replacing the fear in 
his voice. “Moral support, if you 
like, for a theory and a decision I 
am too much a coward to take alone. 
Instead of giving me the necessary 
support, Brady nearly had a fit and 
would not let me finish explaining 
the situation! I don’t know what has 
happened to them back there. They 
act as if they are having an emer- 
gency instead of us!” 

“In a sense, they are — ” began 
Morrison. 

“I think you’re being too unselfish, 
sir,” said McCullough bitingly. “It 
is my considered professional opin- 
ion, for which I do not need moral 
support, that the mental and physical 
stresses involved in coping with the 
local situation are severe enough 
without also making us responsible 
for possible changes in the political 
situation at home. 

“The whole idea is ridiculous! We 
are in the limelight as no other group 
of men has ever been, we know 



IF 




this. In a ^ense we may be standing 
trial for our whole race. But our 
work here will be more valuable, or 
reactions more honest if you like, if 
we don’t allow ourselves to be par- 
alyzed with stage fright! 

“I would like permission, sir,” Mc- 
Cullough ended less vehemently, “to 
request information and assistance 
from Control without having to con- 
sider mass audience reactions.” 

“You have a point. Doctor,” said 
Morrison, after a short pause. “At 
the same time, we can’t afford to 
ignore public opinion completely.” 
“But that’s the way Brady talks!” 
“I’ll think about it, Doctor,” said 
Morrison sharply. “Right now we 
must discuss the food and water situ- 
ation, weapons, tactics and . and 
a change of base. While we are here 
we may as well find out as much as 
possible about the Ship. And while 
we’re talking, Doctor, I’d like you to 
look at my dressings.” 

McCullough wondered if the 
colonel was looking for sympathy, 
then immediately felt ashamed for 
thinking such a thing. Morrison’s in- 
jury was painful and inflamed, al- 
though not infected, and it was only 
one of his many problems. For his 
physical impairment had seriously un- 
dermined his authority. With one 
arm virtually useless he was depen- 
dent on his inferior officers not only 
for protection but for the kind of 
assistance which was more common 
in a nurse-pqtient relationship. And 
cut off as he was from direct contact 
with Control, he could no longer 
speak with all the authority of Earth 
behind his words. As well, the pro- 
ject had come thoroughly unstuck. 



At the present the colonel must be 
feeling frightened and impotent and 
pretty much a total loss to himself 
and everyone else, and as a doctor 
McCullough should not be aggravat- 
ing these feelings. 

It was a time for applying oil to 
the siutation, or perhaps butter. Not 
broken glass. 

AyTcCuUough stayed on the Ship 
IVA three days. In that time their 
“bridgehead” was moved twice, on 
both occasions to compartments close 
to the generator blister so as to 
facilitate the work of Hollis. Despite 
the Twos which attacked them at fre- 
quent but irregular intervals, and at 
times kept them pinned down in their 
base for hours on end, the work of 
gathering information about the Ship 
went on. 

When friction developed, which 
was frequently, he applied oil. Mc- 
Cullough was sure that his bedside 
manner had never had such a strenu- 
ous workout in all its long life. But 
his charm did not work very well 
on the colonel. Despite the arguments 
on the necessity of gathering further 
data to either support or disprove his 
theory, Morrison would not allow 
him to attempt communication with 
the Twos. 

Twos, the colonel had said .... 

Some time later McCullough was 
showing geometrical drawings to one 
of the white, furry Threes while 
Drew kept reluctant watch. Before 
he could get anywhere with the alien 
flying carpet they were attacked sud- 
denly by a pair of Twos. Drew killed 
one of them, and McCullough would 
certainly have died or been very 

143 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED 




seriously injured if his furry alien had 
not attacked the other Two. He was 
even more fortunate to escape with 
a whole spacesuit. 

If anything, the incident had in- 
creased his uncertainty about the 
Twos. 

Were they highly intelligent beings 
caught in the grip of a xenophobia so 
intense that they attacked all strangers 
blindly, without thought? Were they 
less intelligent types, some kind of 
slave class, perhaps, who were cap- 
able of only a limited degree of men- 
tation and whose reactions were little 
above those of an animal? Or was 
his theory, wild and largely unsup- 
ported as it was, correct? 

Was the extraterrestrial life-form, 
Type Two, sentient, nor not? 

XIV 

D uring his next report to the gen- 
eral, McCullough’s voice was as 
neutral and unemotional as any hu- 
man voice could be ... to begin 
with, anyway. 

“In the light of additional data 
gathered within the past few days,” 
he said carefully, “we may have to 
considerably modify our thinking re- 
garding the purpose of the alien ship 
and its crew. 

“Firstly, the Ship — ” 

The alien vessel had made a con- 
trolled approach and had been in- 
serted into an orbit which showed 
every indication of being pre-calcu- 
lated, McCullough went on, after 
which it had taken no action of any 
kind. This, however, did not preclude 
the possibility that it was gathering 
data, since the forward section con- 



tained a number of transparent pro- 
tective blisters which might very well 
house sensory equipment of some 
kind. In fact, the primary — per- 
haps the only — purpose of the 
Ship was the gathering of such data. 

Where the Ship’s construction was 
concerned, and here McCullough had 
to admit that they had investigated 
only a very small fraction of the 
vessel’s enormous volume, they had 
come to certain fairly definite con- 
clusions. 

The way they now saw it, the 
Ship’s construction was based on a 
design philosophy in which weight 
was of little or no importance. Ap- 
parently its source of power was so 
efficient that there was no necessity 
to save an ounce or a pound here 
and there by putting lightening holes 
in structural members or designing 
down an angle bracket so that it 
would take only the amount of stress 
necessary to its function plus a frac- 
tional safety overlap. 

All the indications pointed to the 
fact that the Ship had been built 
in space, probably in an extra-Solar 
asteroid belt or close to a small 
moon where metal and the means of 
working it were at hand. The more 
sophisticated power, control and life- 
support systems had almost certainly 
been built on the home planet and 
transported piecemeal to the hull. 
What little they had seen of the lay- 
out of corridors, wall-nets and 
numerous access points to the Ship’s 
interior made them certain that all 
this had been desgined to assist 
the vessel’s builders rather than its 
crew. 

They may have been guilty of 



144 



IF 




grossly overestimating the intelligence 
capabilities of the crew as well. 

“We have complete data on only 
one of these three life-forms,” Mc- 
Cullough went oh, “and that is the 
tentacled, starfish-shaped Type Two. 
During all our meetings with them 
these beings have been completely 
and uniformly aggressive, so much so 
that after the second alien attack 
Drew remarked that if they behaved 
like wild animals they should be 
treated as such. My subsequent physi- 
ological investigation of the Two re- 
vealed a brain structure and nervous 
system which appeared unusually 
small and uncomplicated and a lack 
of fine control in the appendages, 
facts which suported Drew’s theory. 

“We are all now of the opinion 
that we have been trying to estab- 
lish intelligent communication with 
the alien equivalent of guinea pigs!” 

Their current theory was that the 
Ship was an interstellar probe of some 
kind carrying experimental animals 
which had escaped and overrun the 
ship and killed its crew. There was 
also a strong possibility that they did 
not, and had never had, a crew and 
that the life-support system and in- 
ternal lighting was initially for use 
during the vessel’s construction and 
was subsequently being used by the 
animal passengers. This being the case 
they felt free to fight a defensive war 
against the alien life-forms infesting 
the Ship while they mapped, photo- 
graphed and learned everything they 
could about the vessel’s equipment 
and function. 

Priority, however, would be given 
to finding a method of patching in- 
to the alien life-support system. The 



reason for this, as had been already 
explained, was that the water used 
by the marooned men was almost 
completely lost since only a fraction 
was recoverable to be put through 
the P-ship’s recycling system. 

“Our water is being carefully 
rationed,” McCullough continued, 
“and at the present rate of consump- 
tion the supply will last for thirty- 
two days. This will take us three days 
past the arrival time of the supply ve- 
hicle, but it will carry only a forty- 
day supply of water: A few minutes 
simple computation will show that 
unless we can return the marooned 
men to the P-ships where the water 
supply can be recycled properly, our 
supply problem is logistically insolu- 
ble. 

“We have already drawn heavily 
on the food meant for the return 
trip,” McCullough ended grimly, 
“and if we don’t find a local source 
of water we can never come home.” 

A bout the only thing McCullough 
did not have to worry about 
was General Brady’s reaction to this 
latest report. Earth and Prometheus 
Control were only a few weeks off 
the time when they would pass be- 
hind the Sun; the relay vehicle de- 
signed to circumvent this difficulty 
was not yet in operation, and incom- 
ing messages were rendered almost 
unintelligible by interference. 

Not completely unintelligible, of 
course. By asking Control to repeat 
every sentence anything up to ten 
times Walters was usually able to 
piece together a complete message. 
Unlike McCullough, however, Wal- 
ters had nothing better to do, and 



ALL JUDGMENT FLED

^mehow a signal lost a good deal of 
its urgency and emotional content 
when it had to be repeated so many 
times. 

Precisely on time the high-ac- 
celeration supply rocket homed in on 
P-One’s beacon and was taken 
aboard the alien ship. It contained, 
in addition to the promised water, a 
twenty-day supply of food, film, pa- 
per and a collapsed, carefully pack- 
ed spacesuit. Some well-wisher had 
tucked a .45 automatic inside the 
spacesuit, probably on impulse and 
without taking time to think about 
packing it properly, and the forty-G 
acceleration of the supply vehicle had 
caused the heavy gun to tear a large 
hole in the hip and leg sections, ren- 
dering the suit completely useless. 

They had lost a spacesuit and 
gained an automatic pistol for which 
there was no ammunition. 

T heir search pattern took the form 
of a flat spiral which wound 
slowly around the lateral axis of the 
Ship while moving even more slowly 
forward. At regular intervals a tem- 
porary base was set up with a search 
radius of twenty-five yards or more, 
depending on the available accommo- 
dation and the hostility and numbers 
of the local population. When com- 
pleted the search pattern would still 
leave a long, empty core of unex- 
plored territory in the three-dimen- 
sional map they were constructing. 

They found only storerooms and 
compartments packed with equip- 
ment whose shapes and purpose were 
slowly becoming familiar to them, and 
the ever-present netted corridors 
linking them together. It seemed ob- 



vious that the crew’s quarters, if any, 
as well as the life-support system and 
other essential services were deep in 
the as yet unexplored center of the 
Ship. 

“It is very bad tactics to cut our- 
selves off from the outer hull and 
contact with our ships,” said the 
colonel as they paused, between 
sorties, to fill in another small sec- 
tion of their map, “but it seems to 
me that there are certain periods 
when the risk is lessened. You must 
all have noticed the regular decrease 
in alien activity and numbers which 
seems to occur every five or six 
hours. If we assume this to be due to 
periodic feeding we can, at these 
times, push the search deeper into 
the Ship. Or we might try following 
some of the e-ts — at a safe dis- 
tance, of course — in the hope of 
them leading us to the source of the 
food and water.” 

Hollis said, “The absence of e-ts 
is not entirely regular, sir. There 
seems to be a longer absence, pos- 
sibly due to a sleep period, between 
every few meals. This could be an 
important datum in calculating the 
length of their day and the rotation 
of their home planet.” 

“Personally,” said Drew impatient- 
ly, “I am more interested in gather- 
ing data which will aid our survival. 
For instance, if one of us should 
lose his weapon, is there enough 
known about their physical makeup 
for us to use an e-t form of karate 
on them? Or put another way, Doc- 
tor, where is the dirtiest spot I can 
plant my boot?” 

Reluctantly, McCullough told him. 

They did not deliberately try to 




kin the aliens, doing so only when 
the Twos attacked them — which 
was always. Once they came on a 
dead Two whose condition suggested 
that it had been partially eaten. This 
was another important datum, Hol- 
lis said, which gave strong support 
to McCullough’s theory that the e- 
ts were experimental animals running 
wild rather than sentient beings. 

This did not comfort McCullough 
as much as it should have done, be- 
cause he was developing a new 
theoiy. It rested on the premise that 
the Ship had suffered some kind of 
non-material catastrophe — the psy- 
chological pressures of a too lengthy 
voyage, perhaps — which had driven 
the crew insane so that the Twos 
were either the survivors or descen- 
dants of the original personnel now 
reduced to little more than animals. 

But he did not mention his new 
theory to the others because it would 
have made them unhappy and uncer- 
tain again. 

Hollis and Berryman were becom- 
ing expert at identifying and tracing 
power and control lines without 
actually knowing what it was the lines 
powered or controlled. It should be 
possible, they insisted, to utilize one 
of these currently dead circuits to 
carry radio messages from deep in- 
side the Ship to the metal of the 
outer hull. In effect the circuit or 
section of plumbing would be an ex- 
tension of their suit antennae. And, 
since the signals would be in the 
form of radio frequency impulses 
rather than a flow of current, there 
was little danger of them inadvert- 
ently switching on one of the alien 
controls or mechanisms. 



In order to test this idea and also 
to get a line on the whereabouts of 
the Twos’ feeding place, the next base 
was established some forty yards in- 
board. 

I t was a large gray-walled compart- 
ment filled with disciplined masses 
of plumbing and the usual sealed 
cabinets growing out from all six 
sides. A quick search showed it to 
be empty, and McCullough guarded 
the only entrance, which was a slid- 
ing door rather than the airtight seals 
found under the hull area. Hollis, 
Berryman and Drew were bunched 
together with Morrison floating close 
by, started to argue about a Two 
they had killed and whether or not 
they had defended themselves before 
or after it had actually attacked. 
They began talking loudly, vehe- 
mently, obviously feeling safe in this 
bright alien cupboard, when the Two 
which had been hiding somewhere in 
the compartment landed among them. 

There were shouts, curses and a 
scream that jerked on and off regular- 
ly, as if someone was trying to hold 
a high note while his back was being 
clapped. McCullough swung round 
and raised his weapon, but the center 
of the room was a confused mass of 
twisting, struggling bodies which were 
rapidly becoming obscured by a 
growing red fog, and there was noth- 
ing he could do. The Two had 
wrapped its tentacles around someone 
and was furiously disembowelling him 
with its horn while the others tried 
to tear it loose and kick and stab it 
to death. 

When they finally succeeded in 
pulling it away, McCullough launch- 




ed himself towards the man, grabbed 
him around the waist and held him 
tightly face to face so that he would 
not be able to see his terrible wounds. 
Then he told the man lies in a gentle, 
reassuring voice until Drew separated 
them, saying harshly that the colonel 
was dead. 

Berryman, Hollis and Drew were 
watching him, obviously waiting for 
instructions or possibly for some in- 
dication that he was unwilling to ac- 
cept his responsibility. McCullough 
squeezed his eyes shut in an attempt 
to obliterate the sight of Morrison’s 
body from his mind’s eye as well as 
from normal vision. He tried to pic- 
ture the colonel alive, as he had been 
a few days or hours ago, but great 
soft balls of coagulating blood like ' 
tacky grapes drifted against his face 
as a reminder that all images of 
Morrison alive would inevitably lead 
to the one he was trying to blot out 
of Morrison dead. It was impossible 
for McCullough to think of the 
colonel without seeing the grisly 
thing which spun slowly beside him 
like a bloody Catherine wheel. Be- 
cause it had once been Morrison it 
inhabited every second of the past as 
well as the present. It was only in 
the futuree that the colonel did not 
really exist. 

T here was a feverish sort of logic 
about that thought, McCullough 
told himself. He must think only of a 
time when the colonel did not exist. 
To avoid bringing up memories of 
him, he must think only of the fu- 
ture. But there were a number of 
futures and they began flickering 
past his mind’s eye like pictures from 



the Black Museum. A drowning 
man was supposed to see his past life 
passing before his eyes, but McCul- 
lough was seeing an endless succes- 
sion of future deaths, so he opened 
his eyes and stared back at the others. 

He said, “Berryman, find an 
empty tool locker or something and 
put the colonel’s body in it. Wire or 
wedge the fastening so’s those ani- 
mals won’t be able to get at him. 
When you’ve finished go to the near- 
est hull lock chamber and report 
what has happened to Walters. To- 
day we planned to follow the Twos to 
their food and water supply, and that 
is still at the top of our list of pri- 
orities. 

“However,” he concluded, “if you 
hear a disturbance, don’t come charg- 
ing to our rescue. Stay in a safe 
place until the next lunch break and 
then make your way back here. Un- 
derstand?” 

Berryman looked from Hollis to 
Drew and then back to McCullough. 
Despite the differences in rank and 
the military discipline which was sup- 
posed to bind them, this, McCul- 
lough knew, was something in the na- 
ture of an election. From his ex- 
pression it was obvious that Hollis 
was voting a timid positive; Drew’s 
features registered an angry negative, 
and Walters’s opinions, since he was 
no longer directly involved in the 
Two-human running battle which 
was being waged in the Ship, were 
not being considered. It was Berry- 
man, therefore, who had the casting 
vote in this election, and while the 
silence dragged on McCullough won- 
dered what qualities this normally 
light-hearted pilot thought important

M a leader, and if his qualifications 
were insufficient how exactly Berry- 
man would let him know about it. 

He would be an extremely tactful 
and kindly mutineer, McCullough 
thought. 

Finally Berryman nodded and said 
drily, “The colonel is dead. Long 
live the lieutenant colonel.” 

It had been Morrison’s intention 
to probe the Ship as deeply as possi- 
ble today and to follow the aliens 
to their feeding place despite the risk 
of the Earth party ending up being 
surrounded by practically every Two 
in the Ship. McCullough’s instructions 
were not unexpected, and they prob- 
ably thought that he was carrying 
on as planned out of respect for 
their dead colonel. Or, if they were 
feeling cynical, because he could 
think of nothing better to do. 

As he led them into the corridor 
McCullough wondered why it was so 
important to him that he should get 
as far away from the colonel’s body 
as possible. In the past he had treat- 
ed automobile accident cases and 
examined the pulverized remains of 
jet pilots who had hit the deck at 
close to Mach One, so that Morri- 
son’s body was not by any means 
the worst sight he had had to witness 
in his life. He had even seen a mata- 
dor gored repeatedly by a bull on 
one occasion, and while he had felt 
clinical concern for the unfortunate 
man, some detached portion of his 
mind — a group of rebel brain cells, 
perhaps, which had abstained when 
the majority were taking the Hippo- 
cratic Oath — had been glad that 
on this occasion the bull had been 
able to hit back. 



It was just that in some obscure 
fashion the colonel’s had been such 
a dirty death. McCullough did not 
want to think about it at all. 

They spotted a Two about ten 
minutes later and trailed it at a dis- 
tance of twenty yards or less, de- 
pending on the turns and twists of 
its route. At intervals they wrapped 
pieces of paper around the netting 
so that they would be able to find 
their way back again. But the Two 
ignored them, either because it did 
not see them or because it had some- 
thing more important on its mind. 
A few minutes later it was joined by 
another of its kind, then three more, 
none of which showed any interest 
in their pursuers. The men were push- 
ing deeper and deeper into the Ship 
now, and large stretches of the cor- 
ridors were permanently lit — they 
did not have to switch on the corridor 
lighting here and could not even see 
the switches which controlled it. 
They also became aware of a low, 
moaning sound which rose and fell 
and changed pitched constantly but 
erratically and grew steadily louder. 

S uddenly there were three aliens 
following them and gaining 
steadily. 

Before they became sandwiched too 
tightly between the two groups of e- 
ts McCullough led his party into the 
next empty compartment. Its sliding 
door had a large window so he did 
not switch on the room lights. While 
waiting for the second group to pass 
he had a few minutes to look around, 
and he discovered something which 
almost made him call off the search 
for a water supply. 



150 , 



IF 




This compartment was different 
from the others they had examined. 
Even the light which filtered in from 
the corridor made that very plain. 
The cable runs and ducting were ab- 
sent or hidden behind flush wall pan- 
els, and the objects occupying the 
room had the unmistakable, finished 
look of items of furniture. In the 
center of the room there was sus- 
pended a long cylindrical shape 
which could very well be a free-fall 
hammock. 

“They’ve gone past,” said Drew, 
opening the sliding door. “We’ll have 
to hurry — they’re turning into an 
intersection.” 

Very carefully McCullough mark- 
ed the position of the compartment 
on his map, then left with the 
others. He still felt that he should 
have made them stop until they had 
examined and considered all the im- 
plications of the room they had just 
left. 

A lab animal would not require a 
furnished room. Which meant that 
there were intelligent extraterrestrials 
on the Ship. 

He needed time to think. The 
search for water could be postponed 
for a few hours or days while they 
decided what was the best thing to 
do. McCullough was the boss and 
he would order a return to base. 

But McCullough did not give the 
order because everything began hap- 
pening at once. 

They turned into a corridor unlike 
any they had seen before. One wall 
was made up of heavy wire mesh 
through which they could see a large 
compartment filled with Twos while 
other Twos fought and wriggled their 



way through gaps in the mesh. In- 
side the enclosure the fighting and 
jockeying for position was so vicious 
that several of the e-ts were dead. 
The object of the fighting seemed to 
be to gain a position near a long 
plastic panel running along one wall 
of the enclosure. From the panel 
there sprouted a large number of 
open, small diameter pipes and a 
similar number which terminated in 
rubbery swellings. The fighting which 
was going on made it difficult to see 
what exactly it was that was oozing 
out of them. 

“Semi-liquid food from the pipes, 
I think,” said Hollis excitedly, “and 
what looks like water from the nip- 
ples!” 

He broke off as a single, deafening 
chime reverberated along the corri- 
dor, and they heard their first alien 
voice. 

I t could have been his imagination, 
but McCullough felt sure that the 
sound was subtly unlike the alien 
gobblings of the Twos. The word- 
sounds seemed more complex and 
meaningful, somehow, and there was 
almost a quality of urgency about 
them. He knew that it was ridiculous 
to read meanings into a completely 
alien sequence of sounds, but his feel- 
ing of being warned remained strong. 
Each time the voice paused the sin- 
gle, tremendous chime was repeated 
— or perhaps the voice was speaking 
quickly between chimes. 

The Twos on the other side of 
the mesh became more agitated when 
a chime sounded, but they did not 
stop either eating or fighting each 
other.

Drew said something about Pav- 
lov to Hollis, and McCullough un- 
strapped his tape-recorder. Drew 
swung his weapon to point at a 
nearby speaker grill, where it would 
be possible to get a recording with- 
out too much interference from the 
feeding animals, but he never com- 
pleted the movement. There was a 
blinding double flash as the spear 
touched the mesh and the corridor 
wall. 

E>rew jerked violently, then became 
motionless except for a slow, lateral 
spin. 

A second alien voice joined the 
first one and the meaning sounds 
increased in intensity. 

The new voice seemed to be 
speaking the same language. Very 
often it repeated the same word- 
sounds as the first voice, but it spoke 
over or around it and did not pause 
for the chimes. Sometimes it spoke 
quickly and at other times the words 
were dragged out and their pitch, 
volume and inflexion varied so wide- 
ly that it seemed to be trying to 
sing. McCullough felt confused and 
stupid as he blinked away the green 
after-image of the flash and tried 
to make some kind of sense out of 
what was happening. He needed time 
to think. 

But he was given no time to think, 
because Berryman was coming back 
and shouting at them from the other 
end of the corridor.

generator blisters are beginning to

He walked along the thoroughfare, 
his way empty of everything save 
for the echoes of his footsteps, the 
buildings turned to black, himself. 

The signs were there only for his 
benefit. He moved past them, follow- 
ing their instructions: 

MOUNT THIS STAIR 
ENTER HERE 

He moved through the enormous 



building, breathing heavdy. The stair- 
way without had been far too large 
for one of his kind to negotiate with 
ease. 

As he entered, he felt something 
like release — from the pressure of 
all the eyes, or whatever they called 
them, that had been fixed upon him 
from invisible positions of security. 
He cursed, then chuckled. 

Absolutely alone now, he continued 
to follow ^e signs. They led him 
into a gigantic room, indicated his 
destination. 

He pursued them through the 
carnage, across the black floors, past 
the stage, still set, until he stood 
above the remains that lay beneath 
the sign that said HERE, with an 
arrow pointing downward. 

Then he saw what remained, and 
he unfolded the thing that he bore 



153 




and began filling it with that which 
had died. 

S he stirred. She sucked in the night 
air, sighed, opened her eyes. She 
lay upon a hillside, and the net of 
the sky hung heavy above her with 
its bright catch of stars. She wore 
an asphodel in her long, dark hair. 
When she felt strong enough, she 
sprang to her feet, prepared to flee. 

“Please wait,” said a voice, and 
she turned, waiting, for it was hu- 
man. 

“Yes?” she finally said, in the 
same strange language in which she 
had been addressed. 

“I aroused you and I mean you 
no harm. Don’t flee — please.” 

The figure of a small man moved 
into view, features indistinct. 

She waited until he drew near. 
“Who are you?” she asked. 

“My name is Eric, Eric Weiss,” 
he said. “I helped you to escape.” 
“Escape?” 

“ — From the place where they 
had you confined,” he finished. 
“You speak their language . ” 
“So do you. We all do.” 

“All? I don’t understand. They 
told me I was going to sleep. Why 
did you arouse me?” 

“I was lonely. I have friends, but 
I was lonely nevertheless. Yours 
seemed a lovely and sympathetic 
face.” 

“I understand. Can you tell me 
what is happening, and why?” 
“Perhaps,” he said. “I’U try.” 

A s he drew the shroud up over 
the shoulders of the dead man, 
Francois continued to glance about 



the enormous room. The place was 
filled with corpses, but the one he 
tended was the only human body 
among them. He did not let his gaze 
dwell long upon the shapes of the 
others. There had been as much 
violence on the floor as upon the 
stage that he viewed. 

Shuddering, he hurried. But he 
whistled while he worked. 

T hey walked along the crest of the 
hill, and she looked down upon 
the field of people, caught like ants 
in amber, standing within their 
towers, there in the starlight. 

“What is your name?” he asked 
her. 

“Sappho,” she said. 

“Did you write poetry?” 
“Sometimes.” 

“And live on an isle called Les- 
bos?” 

“Yes.” 

“I had no idea,” he said, “though 
I suspected that everyone down there 
was once noted for something. If it 
will please you to know it, portions 
of your poetry survived for thou- 
sands of years. You are a legend. 
Would you care for a drink of 
water?” 

“Yes, please.” 

“Here. I’ve some fresh fruit also. 
I gathered it in a grove farther to 
the north.” 

“Thank you.” 

“I believe that some sort of end 
is in sight,” he said. 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“I was awakened once, from out 
of my tower of jelly, and asked to 
do a job for our — owners. Some- 
thing in the jelly — DNA, I believe.

is what a friend called it — gives 
us a common tongue which they un- 
derstand. They had, before awaken- 
ing me, come into possession of an 
entire world which was locked to 
them.” 

“Locked?” 

“Yes, it was an artificial planet 
which served as an enormous vault. 
They could not enter it, with all their 
machines and scientists, so they 
aroused me to open it for them. I 
did it with a small file, some wax 
and a length of copper wire. Then 
they returned me to this place, my 
usefulness being a thing of the past. 
Only I resolved to escape, and I did. 
Were you ever so used by them?” 
“Yes. They aroused me and they 
spoke to me, saying: ‘Sappho, we 
need you to seduce a matriarchy with 
your song’ — and I did this thing, 
for 1 thought they were gods. Are 
they not?” 

“No,” said Weiss, “not at all. In 
my day I was considered a great seek- 
er after things beyond mortality, and 
I know that they are not gods. They 
are a race of creatures possessed of 
an interstellar culture far exceeding 
an)^hing mankind ever developed. 
They inherited us and they used us.” 
“What do you mean?” 

“Another race collected us. Re- 
cently the others lost a war to this 
one, who found us here and de- 
cided to use us to exploit their win- 
nings. I feel that there is much con- 
cerning the sciences of the older race 
which they do not understand.” 
“Why do we permit them to do as 
they would with us?” 

“Madam, the human race is ex- 
tinct.” 



“How can that be? We are here. 
I do not understand .•••*’ 

“Nor do I, fully. I am told, 
though, that it killed itself off in a 
great atomic holocaust. I only just 
recently learned what ‘atomic’ means, 
and I appreciate the fact that this is 
probably what happened.” 

“I’m sorry. You’re going too fast 
for me.” 

“We’re dead, that’s what I’m try- 
ing to say. Every creature that lived 
on the planet Earth is dead, save for 
the samples. From among these, we 
have been revived.” 

He gestured at the others, encased 
in the jellies that nourished and sus- 
tained them. 

“Do you know that if you were 
to die again, this night, and if ages 
from now someone were to find a 
bone here upon this hilltop and stick 
it into one of those towers, it would 
reconstruct you — molecule by mole- 
cule, cell by cell — so that you 
could one day be awakened, possessed 
of everything you now possess, ar- 
ranged in precisely the fashion you 
are now arranged, and including the 
last thought that flickered through 
your mind before you died? They 
have the power to regenerate a crea- 
ture from any fragment. I had to re- 
pick the flower you wear in your 
hair, for a full-grown plant hovered 
above your head when I freed you. 
Portions of our corpses were obtain- 
ed; we were rebuilt in this fashion.” 
“I remember,” she said, “my pass- 
ing. I wept and I cried out. It was 
strange to reawaken aboard one of 
their vessels. So they preserved the 
dead and they make them to live 
again . .”

''They didn’l. It was the race they 
destroyed that preserved us. 1 doubt 
that this one even understands the 
process involved. Possibly that first 
race thought we might be worth 
studying sometime, but never got 
around to it. That’s only a guess. 
They rifled our graves and they pre- 
served in their towers of jelly those 
whom they thought represented cer- 
tain worthwhile qualities of the race. 
Apparently, they had been watch- 
ing us for thousands of years.” 

“And they thought me worth pre- 
serving?” 

“The fact that you’re here is 
answer to that. I think they made a 
good choice.” 

“I find it unbelievable,” she said, 
“despite my experience on the world 
of the mothers. I was never that 
popular.” 

He shrugged. 

“I was. But I never thought that 
anyone would care to save me in 
this fashion.” 

The night was cool, silent about 
them. 

F rancois bore the remains down 
the gigantic stair and back along 
the thoroughfare in the direction 
from which he had come. Even the 
robots did not come to aid him. The 
entire thing was in his hands, upon 
his head. They all stayed out of his 
way, and they watched as he left the 
city turned to black. 

In the distance, he saw the ship. 

T he stars shone less brightly as 
dawn began in the east. 

“After they had fought and won 
their war,” Weiss told her, “they 



discovered us. They weren’t sure 
what sort of spoils we were, but 
they’d come into posession of some 
kind of record of this place, so they 
knew what we could do. We had been 
neatly filed and tabulated. They knew 
our talents, our abilities. So they be- 
gan awakening us and asking us to 
do things for them — quite polite- 
ly, I must add.” 

“What were you,” she asked, “that 
you unlocked a world?” 

She saw the whiteness of his smile 
within the morning shadows. 

“Eric Weiss,” he said. “I can es- 
cape from anything anybody can put 
me into, including a mound of living 
gelatin. At your service, lovely lady.” 
And he bowed. “They knew I could 
unlock a world for them, but they 
made the mistake of thinking they 
could reconfine me afterwards.” 
“Why do you think that the end 
is in sight? You said that earlier.” 
“I feel that some catastrophe may 
soon occur, that is true,” he told her. 
“1 can return you to your sleep, if 
you wish. I had thought . .” 
“No,” she said, “1 wish to remain 
awake. Tell me the rest of the 
story.” 

“All right. They recently sent for 
one of our kind, to go to their home 
world for purposes of staging a spe- 
cial entertainment for their rulers. I 
managed to speak with him for some 
time, from where I had hidden my- 
self near their vessel. I learned what 
they wanted of him, and I made him 
aware of many of the things I had 
learned concerning this race. He 
based his ’decision upon what I told 
him — though I tried to dissuade 
him. You see, beyond that high ridge

to the north there is a small colony 
of those I have freed, of which our 
owners so far know nothing. Thus 
have I gained the counsel of many, 
as weU as information from those few 
who had been awakened and em- 
ployed. Now another man has been 
sent for. Machiavelli, who analyzed 
the situation, thinks that we may be 
doomed.” 

“Why?” 

“Well,” said Weiss, “if the politi- 
cal situation is truly what he guessed 
it to be, and the man with whom 
I spoke is now dead, as I fear he 
must be . .” 

F rancois entered the ship and call- 
ed out the words he had been 
told to say. The hatches closed be- 
hind him, and the vessel rose into 
the air. He locked his burden in 
one of the cabins. 

There was a great silence about 
him. 

He sat and watched stars through 
the viewport for the entire journey. 

He realized that there was no real 
need to have locked the cabin. 

CCX/'ou see, the first race — the 
I one that did the thing — is 
dead,” said Weiss, “and now they 
have done it. If what Machiavelli 
thinks might happen happens, then 
they will probably destroy such a 
menace as the remaining sample — 
ourselves.” 

“What’s that?” She pointed. 

He looked up. The great, wedge- 
shaped vessel cruised silently above 
the valley, its many fins slicing the 
brightening air as it descended, drew 
nearer. 

HE THAT MOVES 



“That,” he said, “is the ship bear- 
ing the last man to depart here. Its 
design is the same. He should be re- 
turning with the remains of the play- 
er. I am convinced that he can tell 
us our fate, if he is not in restraint 
or dead himself.” 

F rancois stepped down from the 
vessel, which closed itself behind 
him and rose immediately into the 
air. He placed the corpse upon the 
ground and watched the ship climb 
at a great speed. Suddenly, it was re- 
placed by an orange-gold fireball, and 
after a time there came a sound as 
of thunder. 

In the distance, he saw two fig- 
ures advancing toward him. He wait- 
ed for them to approach. 

“What is the verdict?” Weiss call- 
ed out. 

“We live,” he replied. “They told 
me of their fears and asked for par- 
don before I did this thing. It would 
seem that it was indeed as had been 
rumored there and guessed here. In 
order to gain his position, their last 
head of state slew his gens-brother 
and married his wives. The son of 
the slain Lord suspected this, but had 
no evidence. He slew his stepfather, 
however, after witnessing his reactions 
to the play. The entire court per- 
ished in the uprising that followed.” 
“Then why — ?” 

“It is difficult to conceive of a 
race sufficiently advanced to con- 
quer an interstellar empire, yet as 
gullible as this. But they based their 
conclusion on a sort of logic. Each 
of us who has been aroused has 
demonstrated a great ability along 
some line. They now consider these 

157 




divine attributes. The first race had 
disturbed him and died. Their ruler 
disturbed him also, and carnage was 
wrought within his court, and he per- 
ished. They are now convinced that 
we are the gods of the old race, and 
they fear our wrath. They quaran- 
tined the palace until one of us 
could be gotten to remove the body. 
Now they would have no more to 
do with us. As you witnessed, they 
even destroyed the ship that was in- 
volved in the act. 

“If I gave a damn about life or 
death, I might even fear the curse 
myself,” said Francois, hefting the 
body and bearing it toward the valley 
of the mounds, whistling as he went. 

After a time, Sappho touched 
Weiss’ arm. He smiled at her and 
stared into her dark eyes. 

“What are those little trays be- 
fore each mound?” she asked. 

“I don’t know. I’ve never been able 
to figure that out.” 

“They are like,” she said, “the 
offering trays my people laid before 
the gods, in the old days of Earth.” 
“You mean — ?” 

“I believe that we were indeed 
the gods of the first race. For some 
reason, they worshipped the greatest 
among men and preserved them here 
in eternal slumber. I know that man 
behind you — the one with the neck- 
lace and the war-tattoo. He is Aga- 
memnon.” 

Ahead of them, Francois removed 
the shroud and began the task of 
placing the broken body back into 
its mound of preservative. They 
moved to join him. 

“A race that sought its gods from 
among another race?”

“It is no more foolish than to 
seek them anywhere else, is it?” 
They watched Francois at his task. 
“That poor man,” she said. “The 
one v;ho saved us.” And there were 
tears in her eyes as she spoke. 

“If that first race thought he 
was a god, they took a hell of a 
chance when they moved him,” said 
Francois. 

“Perhaps,” said Weiss, “they 
thought that moving him to honor 
him would absolve them of the curse 
he had promised.” 

“And the conquerors did not be- 
lieve in the gods of those whom 
they had vanquished — until now,” 
said Francois. “We’re free. This 
world is ours. They’ll never bother 
us again. 1 — Damn!” 

Weiss rushed to his side, but it 
was too late. He had slipped upon 
a portion of the gelatinous substance, 
and his temple had struck against 
the only rock in sight. He lay very 
still. 

They raised him and placed him 
within another mound. 

I don’t believe it’s what it seems,” 
said Weiss. “It was only coincidence. 
It had to be.” 

“At least he’ll recover, won’t he?” 
“Yes, I should think so. We will 
all recover from death or injury, for 
so long as this jelly lasts — which 
should be long enough to get the 
human race back on its feet again.” 
“What are those words on the 
piece of stone he struck? Are they 
of your language?” 

“Yes,” and he read, silently: 

GOOD FRIEND FOR lESVS SAKE

“It says that he would resent being 
disturbed” be told her. 



“His face is so kind,” she said. 
“Who was he?” 

“Nobody really knows for sure,” 
he said. 

Sapj^o removed an ancient flower 
from her hair and placed it at the 
feet of the broken man in the capsule. 

Eric Weiss turned away from her 
strange, sad eyes, prisoner once more 
in the barless cage of himself. END

HE THAT MOVES jf59 




HUE 

AND 

CRY 



Dear Editor, 

Where has your magazine been 
all my life? 

I started reading science-fiction 
at the age of eleven, and it took 
me to the advanced age of fifteen 
before I discovered //. Man! It was 
electrifying, almost as exciting as 
discovering girls. 

I don’t know why it took me so 
long. Perhaps it’s where If is lo- 
cated on the newsstands. Being sur- 
rounded by Playboy and True De- 
tective doesn’t make it any easier 
to get noticed even with your great 
covers. 

As for your content, you run 
more good stories than anybody else 
on the market. I especially liked 
your serials Spaceman and Faust 
Aleph Null. While we’re on the sub- 
ject, how about one by Andre Nor- 
ton? I’d like to see more of her in 
your magazine. 

I also enjoy “Our Man in Fan- 
dom” which is much better than a 
science article would be. After all, 
there are plenty of books on science 
in the library, but none on Fandom. 

“Hue and Cry” is also very good. 
It gives your readers a chance to 
express their ideas and is almost 
always entertaining I say almost 
always because you keep printing 

i ) 



letters that remind us how great 
science-fiction was in the “thrifty 
thirties”, “facetious forties” and 
“flabbergasting fifties”. Well, from 
where I’m sitting the “swinging 
sixties” are even better. So how 
about running more information on 
current trends in s-f instead of all 
that reminiscing. 

Remember. Writing styles are not 
the only thing that has changed 
about science-fiction over the years. 
The reader has too. Today’s teen- 
age fan will be just the right age 
to colonize the moon, be on the first 
expeditions to Mars and Venus, 
build underwater cities, and a lot 
more if the world doesn’t go to pot 
first. In any case I’ll keep writing 
if you keep putting out such a good 
magazine. And who know^s? You 
may be the first one to get a fan 
letter from the moon. — Bill Bur-

Dear Editor: 

Faust Aleph-Null is a put-on. Of 
its seventy pages of actual text, 
nineteen are concerned with meti- 
culous and boring details of con- 
juration. Even Blish realizes that 
this is a little much and telescopes 
the summoning of eleven demons in- 



160 




to a single paragraph in Part 3 
(after spending, four pages sum- 
moning nineteen others) . per- 
haps in recognition of the growing 
weariness of his Tanists.” (Part 3, 
page 147) Me, too. 

It has an idiot plot as well. Only 
by assuming that both Ware and 
Baines, as well as Baines’s assis- 
tants, are amoral and insane can 
the reader even begin to accept what 
is going on. Baines has no motiva- 
tion for setting loose all the demons 
of Hell except curiosity and the 
sadistic streak that he denies is part 
of his personality. He says, “I in- 
vented it, I called it into being, I’m 
paying for it — and no matter how 
else you describe it, I made it, and 
ifs mine** (Part 3, page 155) The 
man is a megalomaniac. Ware, 
knowledgeable as he is in arcane 
doings, refuses to believe that 
Baines’s scheme is as destructive as 
it obviously is. Since . Armaged- 
don requires the prior appearance 
of the Antichrist,” (Part 3, page 
135) and he is sure no Antichrist 
yet exists, he doesn’t worry. He 
doesn’t stop to think that anything 
less than Armageddon can spoil his 
precious search for knowledge. 
World War Three — or simply some 
large-scale, imnamed social, political 
or economic upset — need not be 
Armageddon, yet it can make Ware’s 
money worthless and make it im- 
possible for him to procure the tools 
which are crucial to his conjura- 
tions. And if he thinks the loosed 
demons won*t wreak as much havoc 
as they can, even though it must be 
short of Armageddon, then he’s an 
idiot. 

And the rest are idiots to believe 
that Ware will protect them any 
longer than is necessary for the 



cashing (if possible) of that five 
million dollar check. Since he’s 
amoral and a magician (and they 
are not magicians), he has a hold 
over them, not vice versa. 

The only enjoyable part of the 
story is Blish’s faannish digs at 
other writers: Fr. Anson (Hein- 
lein), Fr. Bonfiglioli, Fr. Boucher, 
Fr. Vance, Fr. Selahny (Zelazny, 
or perhaps Delaney) and himself as 
Fr. Atheling. But is If a fanzine? 

As for the rest — well, I can 
read a good part of it in Ceremonial 
Magic by Arthur Edward Waite. I 
don’t think that any kind of story 
ought to serve primarily as a ve- 
hicle for the author’s research. 
Faust Aleph^Null was tedious and 
unsatisfying; occasional good fan- 
tasy would be a welcome variation 
in the If bill of fare, but the Blish 
piece definitely does not fit in that 
category. — Phyllis Eisenstein,

Dear Editor: 

First things first. For the last two 
years or so, you have had a report, 
in the December issue, on the pre- 
ceding World Science Fiction Con- 
vention (in ’65, a special feature by 
Robert Bloch; in '66, an editorial by 
yourself). Question: will you con- 
tinue this practice this year? I cer- 
tainly hope so. 

I was sorry to see WOT go, al- 
though I was never able to afford 
both it and If at the same time, my 
affluence being more than somewhat 
limited. Still, I’m glad to see that If 
now ihas Sam Moskowitz’s articles 
on sf’s history. Incidentally, I was 
rather puzzled by the omission, in 
‘‘When Women Rule,” of the matri- 
archy described in Search the Sky. 



HUE & CRY 



161 




This seems to be a mucTi more logi- 
cal one tihan many of those discussed 
in the article. Of course, it was only 
dealt with in a portion of the book, 
and so might have easily been over- 
looked. 

Now that Worlds of Tomorrow 
has been combined with //, it be- 
comes more and more obvious that If 
and Galaxy are simply extensions of 
the same malgazine, especially fea- 
ture-wise. If (has Lin Carter’s series 
on fandom and Mr. Moskowitz’s his- 
tory lessons; Galaxy has Willy Ley’s 
science articles and Aigis Budrys’ 
book reviews. Boooo, as long as 
they’re practically one and the same 
anyway, why not combine them into 
one extra-large bl-monttily? 

I can see it 'all now. You could call 
it V/orlds of If hi Tomorrow's GaU 
axy or Tomorrow's Galaxy of Ifs, or 
possibly even If: A Galaxy of To- 
morrows (so as ito fit all three titles 
in). It would ihave about 460 pages 
— which is about how many pages 
we get now in two Ifs and a Galaxy 
every two months — allowing plenty 
of room for all the current features 
and maybe a new one or two. 
There’d bo lots of room for fiction, 
and you might even run a full-length 
novel in each issue, as well as short 
stories. The price would be rather 
high — $1.75 to $2.00 — but when 
you come right down to it, we’re 
already paying that much for the 
equivalent. 

Besides, there’s another way 
around the cost. New readers are 
bound to think it’s a book at first, 
so you could work up an arrange- 
ment with, say Ballantine Books 
and go into simultaneous hard and 
soft cover editions. Subscribers could 
pay a few dollars more and get hard 

U2 



cover magazines delivered right to 
their door. 

And it’s sure to attract new read- 
ers, many of whom will think it’s a 
new series of books comparable to 
Judith Merril’s “Year’s Best SP” or 
Ace’s “World’s Best Science Fiction : 
19so-and-so”. Who knows? It may 
even be reviewed in other magazines. 

Well, back to reality. Internation- 
al Science Fiction sounds good. I 
just hope that the British writers, 
who already have a fairly large 
readership in the U.S., do not mon- 
opolize the magazine. Not that I 
want the British banned entirely, 
of course, but if the purpose of the 
magazine is to familiarize American 
readers with foreign authors — put 
it this way, what American science 
fiction fan needs to be introduced to 
Arthur C. Clarke? 

I favor some identification of the 
“Firsts” in each issue. After all, 
they’re often the people to watch. 
Look at Larry Niven. — John Bor- 
ger. Box 66, Rt. 4, Parkersburg, W. 
Va. 26101.

Dear Editor of 3, almost 4, SF Mags: 

In this corner, all green on IN- 
TERNATIONAL SCIENCE FIC- 
TION. Will buy. Sounds like a good 
idea — but you should spend more 
time writing SF than editing it. I 
suppose most of the authors will be 
British, but of the French, German, 
etc., authors, have you given any 
thought to publishing an occasional 
story in its native language? Some 
of us language nuts might appreci- 
ate it. (The material in Quinto 
Lingo is rather dull.) 

Good luck on your first new mag- 
azine in four years. — Stanley Per- 
rin, 1919 Dobson Street, Evanston,

“We want to test 
your writing aptitude” 



By Gordon Carroll 

Director, Famous Writers School. Former 
editor, Reader’s Digest, Time, Inc., Coronet 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
I would like to test your writing aptitude. 
We’ll help you find out if you can be 
trained to become a successful writer. 

Several years ago, we started the 
Famous Writers School. Our aim was to 
help qualified people acquire the skills 
they need to break into print. We poured 
everything we knew about writing into 
a new kind of professional training 
course, which you take at home and in 
your free time. After a solid grounding 
in fundamentals, you get advanced train- 
ing in the specialty of your choice— Fic- 
tion, Non-Fiction, Advertising or Busi- 
ness Writing. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers or editors. 
Your instructor spends up to two'^ours 
analyzing your work. He blue-pencils 
corrections right on it — much as an 
editor does with established writers. 
Then he returns it to you with a long 
personal letter of advice and specific 
recommendations. 

This training works well. Our students 
have sold their writing to more than 100 



publications including Reader s Digest, 
True, Red hook. 

Stephen Novak of Wayne, N. J., says, 
‘T just received a check from Ellery 
Queen s Mystery Magazine. That’s 1 1 
stories sold in six months.” Doris Steb- 
bins of S. Coventry, Conn., who has sold 
six stories to Woman’s Day for $2,050 
writes, “Taking your Course has made 
it all possible.” 

Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you can benefit from this 
training, send for the School’s Aptitude 
Test. If you test well, or offer other evi- 
dence of writing ability you may enroll. 
But there is no obligation to do so.
