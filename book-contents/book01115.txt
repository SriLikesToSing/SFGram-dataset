€ ORBWAINER SMITH 


/^|f all the New Masters of sci- 
^ ence fiction that have turned 
up in the past decade or two, 
the man called Cordwainer Smith 
surely ranks among the highest. 
His first story appeared in a 
small-circulation magazine pub- 
lished on the West Coast in the 
late 4Q’s; it was called Scanners 
Live in Vain, and it is perhaps the 
chief reason why that magazine 
is remembered. One story . 
that was all anyone had seen from 
him, and for several years there 
were no more. 

Then, gradually, others began 
to appear. A short story here; a 
year or so later, a novelette there. 
Readers began to look for his 
name. In his stories, which were 
a wonderful and inimitable blend 
of a strange, raucous poetry and 
a detailed technological scene, we 
began to read of human beings in 
worlds so far from our own in 
space in time that they were no 
longer quite Earth (even when 
they were the third planet out 
from Sol), and the people were 
no longer quite human, but some- 
thing perhaps better, certainly 
different. 


Most of Cordwainer Smith’s 
stories appeared first in this 
magazine, a circumstance which 
has given us a good deal of pride 
over the years. But with an even 
greater measure of sorrow we 
have to say that there will be few 
more of them, perhaps none at 
all. 

I n the hot August of 1966 Paul 
Linebarger died. 

One of the most closely guard- 
ed secrets in science fiction was 
that Cordwainer Smith and Dr. 
Paul Linebarger of Johns Hop- 
kins and the State Department 
were one and the same man. 

He was a fascinating man, and 
a warm and friendly one. His 
background was — there is no 
other word for it — unique : god- 
son of Sun Yat Sen, confidante 
of rulers of half Asia, consultant 
to American foreign policy. He 
was not a man who could readily 
be spared. 

He is deeply missed, for his 
stories and for himself.

Children in Hiding 

by JOHN BRUNNER 


All the Babies were healthy in 
every way . except in their 
minds, where Something lurked! 


ttiyrr. Murphy is here,” said 

lv A 'dig speaker on the desk. 
“The special investigator from 
Earth. I’m sending him in right 
away.” 

Hans Lammergeier, Chief Ad- 
ministrator of the Status Two 
colony planet Landfall, jolted 
out of his obsessive brown study. 
He’d been thinking about the 
same problem as usual, of 
course. On Landfall (population 
twenty million, gravity 1.09 
Earth, atmosphere, climate and 
period of rotation “acceptable”) 
there was only one real prob- 
lem. 

He shot out a hand and tapped 
the switch on the desk which 
turned the wall on his left brief- 


ly into a mirror. He looked him- 
self over, adjusting the collar of 
his old gray jacket, thrusting a 
stray lock of hair back where it 
belonged over his growing bald 
patch, making the normal inef- 
fectual gestures of an overworked 
colonial administrator faced with 
an important visitor. 

For one moment before cutting 
the mirror, he stared at his ap- 
pearance. Hans Lammergeier, 
age sixty-one. Forehead lined, 
eyes sunken, hair graying and 
falling out — Earthside, you’d 
say ninety, maybe a hundred. 
And he was far past the stage 
at which he could contrive to 
make himself look merely ex- 
perienced and grave. 


43 


Damn the Babies! 

The door squeaked open. 
Guiltily he shut off the mirror 
and rose, extending his thin, 
knobbly hand across his desk. 

“Mr. Murphy!” he said in his 
best approximation of a warmly 
welcoming tone. “I’m Lammer- 
geier, of course. Please sit down.” 

Mr. Murphy was a typical 
Earthman: shorter than Lam- 
mergeier, sallow, with dark hair 
and a suspicion of imminent fat- 
ness. Earthside diet had been 
starchy for five generations, and 
it tended to show before the pop- 
ulation reached middle age. But 
he was in glowing good health 
despite that; his clothes were im- 
peccable, and Lammergeier 
would not have undertaken to 
guess his age closer than ten 
years. 

Overcrowded, underfed — that 
was the prediction. The colonists 
would have the edge everywhere : 
more room, more food, more 
clean natural air . And look 
at the two of us! Damn the 
Babies! 

But Lammergeier swallowed 
his instinctive reaction and did 
no more than resume his own 
seat. 

A IT urphy, setting a memocase 
on the desk’s forward rim, 
looked around him with some 
distaste. Lammergeier didn’t 
blame him for that. The office 
44 


hadn’t been redecorated in four- 
teen years, and there was a crack 
across the ceiling which occa- 
sionally shed white dust when 
the foundations settled another 
millimeter. It must represent to 
Murphy the logical climax of 
what he’d seen on his way from 
the spaceport: potholed roads, 
weed-thick fields, tumbledown 
houses .... 

Suddenly conscious of how well 
he fitted his setting, in this jac- 
ket that hadn’t been cleaned for 
six months and was anyhow far 
older than any garment should 
decently be allowed to become, 
Lammergeier cleared his throat. 

“I must — uh — apologize 
for the appearance of my home 
world, Mr. Murphy. The air of 
neglect, which you’ve doubtless 
remarked on, is solely due to the 
matter which compelled us to 
ask for your assistance.” 

Recalling the wrangling that 
had preceded the decision — the 
expressions of shame at confes- 
sing failure after the grand prom- 
ises on which their colony had 
been set afloat — he grimaced. 

Murphy shrugged and made 
a tiny adjustment to one of the 
controls on his memocase. “I 
was advised during my briefing 
of the magnitude of the trouble,” 
he said. His voice was as oily as 
his fat-taut skin. “But until I 
saw it with my own eyes I found 
it incredible that half the avail- 

GALAXY 


able resources of a planet as po- 
tentially rich as Landfall should 
be absorbed into — h’m — what 
does actually absorb it. You are 

— check me if the situation has 
altered since I was first briefed 

— supporting four million totally 
non-productive individuals!” 

Lammergeier felt the first 
beads of sweat prickle on his 
skin. What he’d expected from 
Earth he hadn’t been sure. At 
the very back of his mind, per- 
haps, after his long and bitter 
struggle to persuade his Plane- 
tary Council that they must doff 
their pride and appeal to Earth, 
he’d nursed a fantasy of some 
team of miracle workers, who 
would thunder out of the sky in 
the latest interstellar cruiser and 
instantly solve the Babies prob- 
lem before deciding to settle here 
themselves. 

Instead .... 

S truggling to be both polite 
and firm, he said, “That’s 
hardly a fair way to put it, Mr. 
Murphy. The future of our colo- 
ny was predicted on a certain 
available supply of manpower — 
and womanpower too, I needn’t 
stress that. What would you 
have had us do? Dig mass graves 
and shovel the Babies in by the 
tens of thousands?” 

“According to what I was told,” 
Murphy said, “they’re effective- 
ly mindless, and there are mil- 

CHILDREN IN HIDING 


lions of them. They must be the 
direct cause of the poor main- 
tenance I’ve observed in your 
buildings and roads, and doubt- 
less elsewhere that I shall dis- 
cover later. Moreover, the aver- 
age daily calorie intake of your 
people is lower than that of 
Earth, a shocking display of mis- 
management, in view of the fact 
that our population is now al- 
most as high in the billions as 
yours is in the millions. Correct, 
or not?” 

“Yes! But — ” Lammergeier’s 
forehead was now so damp he 
could not refrain from mopping 
it. He registered Murphy’s disap- 
proval of his using a handker- 
chief that would be returned to 
his pocket, instead of a hygienic 
tissue delivered at once to a 
disposall. And ignored it. 

“Bear with me while I try and 
make clear how it looks to us,” 
he requested. “From Earth, I 
don’t contest it must seem to 
reflect mismanagement. But — 

“Oh, I’ll have to go back to 
the beginning. Landfall has been 
established as a Status Two 
colony since the middle of last 
century. During our immigra- 
tion period, nothing but nothing 
happened to cast doubt on our 
assumption that it would turn 
out a perfectly habitable world.” 

“You say ‘our’ assumption,” 
Murphy murmured. “You were 
here at the time, then?” 


45 


Galaxy! Do I look that ancient 
to him? 

In the nick of time Eammer- 
geier spotted the betraying twist 
on Murphy’s mouth and bit 
back his indignant denial, 

A needier. But I don't have 
to rise to his baiting. 

“I employ the word merely 
to emphasize the deep involve- 
ment everyone here feels with 
the fate of the colony.” There 
— that was a diplomatic way of 
putting it! “You will hardly have 
overlooked that the pre-colonial 
stage was masterminded direct 
from Earth, and the government 
of the time was surely no less 
concerned for the fate of its 
intending emigrants than the 
present one which has sent you 
here to advise us.” 

Was that a wince from Mur- 
phy? Lammergeier couldn’t be 
certain. Hoping the jab had 
found its mark, he hurried on. 

“The — ah — epidemic, if 
that’s what it is, which be- 
gan twenty years ago came with- 
out warning. The birth of sever- 
al infants who after a period of 
months, if not years, turned out 
to be subnormal could hardly 
have been detected while they 
were still unweaned, could it?” 
“Interesting local dialectal 
variant you just used,” Murphy 
put in. “Four million described 
as ‘several!’ ” 

“It wasn’t four million to be- 
46 


gin with!” Lammergeier was red- 
dening. “This thing has been 
going on for twenty years!” 
“And in the whole of that time, 
no normal infant has been born 
on this planet?” 

“Well . no.” Lammergeier 
forced out the admission in a 
whisper. 

From where Murphy was sit- 
ting, it must look like insanity 
to send for help only now, when 
the situation was out of control. 
Yet how could he hope to ex- 
plain the real state of affairs? 
He, even he who had fought 
and won that bitter argument in 
the Council over so many years, 
felt the most violent revulsion 
at the idea of killing off the 
Babies and starting a fresh gen- 
eration with adopted children 
from some other planet. That 
was the wildest idea voiced dur- 
ing the debate, but also the most 
promising. And didn’t that sum 
up their predicament! 

In any case, suppose it hap- 
pens all over again with the des- 
cendants of the newcomers? 

Murphy’s eyes had wandered 
around the room again. Now he 
pointed at a faded chart hanging 
lopsidedly from a single pin in 
the wall at Lammergeier’s back. 
“What’s that?” 

Lammergeier craned around 
and felt a stab of surprise. That 
map had been there for so long, 
he’d ceased to register its exist- 

GALAXY 


ence — it was a background de- 
tail. In a tone of mild wonder, 
he said, “Why it shows the 
course of the epidemic from the 
first township at which it was 
reported, to the limit of its 
spread.” 

“Which was the whole inhab- 
ited area of the planet.” 

“Er — yes, I’m afraid so,” 
Lammergeier confirmed miser- 
ably. 

“Fantastic,” Murphy mutter- 
ed. “I was reading stats of some 
of the advertising material dis- 
tributed during Landfall’s colo- 
nial phase. It makes a sorry con- 
trast with the actual state of 
affairs. Well, let’s not rake over 
dead ash right now. I shall need 
to see the consequences of the 
phenomenon with my own eyes.” 

' I 'here was only one place to 
take him, of course. 'Lammer- 
geier took him there, in a wheez- 
ing car forty-odd years old held 
together by string, wire and the 
patient attention of its eighty- 
year-old driver. The arrival of 
Murphy had lent Lammergeier a 
fresh viewpoint, and now he 
thought with a shock of dismay: 
Why, we’re a planet of old folks' 

Nowhere on Landfall was 
there a functioning human be- 
ing younger than the age of about 
forty. And the youngest were 
forty the way he was sixty: 
looking and feeling half as old 
CHILDREN IN HIDING 


again, one foot already in the 
grave. 

He stifled the realization and 
spoke aloud, pointing through 
the car’s windshield at a building 
which was looming ahead. 

“That’s the Babies’ Home for 
the capital and environs. The 
present population is about eight 
thousand. But as you see we’re 
having to add a new wing.” 

Murphy scowled and said 
nothing. 

He didn’t in fact speak again 
until they were in the lobby of 
the building. Lammergeier had 
had no chance to phone through 
and warn the staff of their ar- 
rival — the phone cables were 
out again and no one could be 
spared to fix them until next 
week. Actually, they walked 
straight into the middle of an 
event which was heartbreakingly 
typical of the whole calamitous 
mess. 

At the reception desk, flanked 
by two uniformed policemen, a 
woman in a shabby dress stood 
clinging desperately to a child 
of about six or seven, far too 
heavy for her to carry yet cradled 
tightly in her arms. Facing her 
were a nurse with a lined, weary 
face under a mop of gray hair 
and a bald elderly doctor in a 
once-white coat. 

Lammergeier whispered to 
Murphy, “Wait here a second, 
and I’ll get the director to con- 

47 


duct you around personally.” 
“No!” Murphy raised a hand, 
eyes on the scene at the recep- 
tion desk. “What’s going on?” 
“Well, I assume she’s what we 
call a ‘hider’,” Lammergeier ex- 
plained. “Despite the fact that 
we don’t get normal children any 
longer, the maternal instinct 
seems to be insuppressible. I 
suppose the two things must go 
together: our reluctance to face 
hard facts and stop trying to 
keep these useless Babies alive, 
and the refusal of so many wom- 
en to part with their children. Of 
course, it would be ridiculous 
to allow them to stay with their 
parents. The planet’s economy 
is rocky enough already. If mem- 
bers of our labor force were com- 
pelled to take time every day — 
and night — to attend to their 
children, things would be im- 
possible. We tie up plently of 
workers by adopting the central- 
ized system, but at least the 
loss of the economy is concentrat- 
ed in certain district and confined 
to certain professions.” 

“It’s compulsory to bring chil- 
dren in to these establishments, 
then?” 

“Oh, yes. It has been for al- 
most fifteen years. But like I 
said, you still get these ‘hiders’.” 
Murphy nodded. “The children 
— the Babies — are literally 
helpless, are they? Even when 
they attain the advanced age at 

48 


which the oldest must be by now 
— say twenty?” 

“Completely helpless,” Lam- 
mergeier said. “They’re exact- 
ly like babies, which is what we 
call them. They have to be fed, 
changed, lifted up and down 
from bed to floor so they can 
play a bit — they show interest 
in bright colors and moving toys, 
but that’s the absolute limit of 
their mental attainments.” 

Abruptly the woman at the 
desk burst into hysterics. The 
policeman gently but firmly 
separated her from the Child, 
handed it over to the nurse, and 
marched her out, still screaming 
as though her throat would split. 
Lammergeier and Murphy stood 
in silence till she was gone. 

fTphen Murphy shook his head. 

“Fantastic. I’m sorry, but I 
find all this incredible. With the 
advantages of a planet that’s 
still virgin over most of its sur- 
face, to wind up in this plight!” 
“You don’t understand,” Lam- 
mergeier sighed. 

“Maybe not. After all, I come 
from Earth, where a nonproduc- 
tive individual is a luxury we 
barely tolerate at all. Certainly 
we wouldn’t tolerate twenty per 
cent of them in the population, 
nor would we go to such elabor- 
ate lengths to enable their sur- 
vival!” 

“But there’s nothing apparent- 
GALAXY 


ly wrong with them!” Lammer- 
geier barked. “To all outward 
appearance they’re healthy, 
they’re organically sound; If 
some way could be found of 
bringing their intelligence up to 
— if not full adult status — at 
any rate bright idiot level, we 
could let them look after them- 
selves, and what’s more we’d get 
work out of them. They represent 
a tremendous potential increment 
to our work force! Get them out 
of their beds where they lie like 
vegetables, and we’d be back on 
our original development sched- 
ule within half a century!” 
‘‘And that’s the miracle you’re 
expecting me to work?” Murphy 
demanded coldly. 

“Well — not you exactly. But 
we hoped that with Earth’s vast 
store of knowledge and skills we 
haven’t had time to bring for- 
ward on Landfall ...” 

“I presume,” Murphy said 
with biting irony, “you’ve been 
too busy to calculate the mere 
time it would take to process 
the millions of your — your ba- 
bies, even granting such a pro- 
cess could be devised!” 

“I — uh — I imagine it would 
take years, at least,” Lammer- 
geier stammered. 

“At least,” confirmed Murphy. 
“I am not here to wave a magic 
wand and bring your idiot chil- 
dren out of their overgrown 
creches, as you appear to ima- 

CH1LDREN IN HIDING 


gine. I’m here simply and solely 
to evaluate the situation and 
make a recommendation as to the 
future visibility of our colony on 
Landfall. Now if that’s under- 
stood, shall we proceed?” 

I t was fortunate for Lammer- 
geier that from that point on 
he could hand over the job of 
explaining things to Murphy. 
Director Chen and Matron Hob- 
day had all the facts at their 
tonguetips, where Murphy liked 
them. He trailed behind as they 
recited the statistics, identified 
the rooms, the endless corridors, 
the life-support system which 
took the worst of the burden 
off the adult staff. Everything 
seemed to blur into an endless 
sequence of babies and Babies: 
the mewling puling infants and 
the puling mewling adolescents, 
a kind of blasphemy against 
human form in their mindless 
oblivion. 

He only returned to full aware- 
ness when they paused before a 
door he recognized. It was a 
little more stained, and the paint 
was more chipped than the last 
time he’d seen it, five years ago. 
But it was the same door. And 
the same paint. 

“And this room houses the first 
of them,” Director Chen was say- 
ing. “You’ll perhaps have notic- 
ed that this is the oldest wing of 
the building; the remainder is 


49 


entirely a series of more recent 
extensions. When the very first 
of the — ah — victims were 
identified, they were brought 
here for observation, and apart 
from minor alterations necessitat- 
ed by their growing older and 
larger, their quarters are the 
same that they’ve always 
known.” 

“Such darlings they are, too!” 
exclaimed Matron Hobday, who 
added uncomfortably when Mur- 
phy stared at her, “Well — in 
their own way, you know!” 
Chen, frowning, made to open 
the door. Murphy stopped him 
with a gesture and betrayed ap- 
prehension. 

“Ah — are they of normal 
adult size now?” he asked. 

“Oh yes. Within the Landfall 
range of height and weight.” 
“And they’re completely un- 
aggressive? I mean, I should 
have thought that an infantile 
mind in an adult body was like- 
ly to lead to at least occasional 
outbursts of bad temper, which 
might be rather destructive.” 
“No, that’s one thing I can 
safely say we’ve never observ- 
ed,” Chen assured him. “Had the 
condition led to violent tantrums 
I’m sure we’d have been in touch 
with you much earlier than this.” 
“I see.” Murphy rubbed his 
chin. “And something else. How 
many adults and near-adults are 
there at present?” 

50 


“Over — shall we say fifteen 
years of age?” Chen suggested. 
On Murphy’s nod, he counted 
to himself. “Approximately . 
three-quarters of a million. 
There was a peak, you see, about 
two years after the knowledge 
of our problem became wide- 
spread. Our fertile parents all 
knew their heredity was good — 
they’d been checked for it as a 
matter of routine — so they 
futilely attempted to beat the 
odds. Later, the mood changed, 
and now most people have given 
up trying. A case like the one 
you saw downstairs on your ar- 
rival is a rarity these days, 
though as recently as three years 
ago -it would have been com- 
monplace.” 

“Good, that’s all I wanted to 
know.” Murphy pointed at the 
door. “Shall we go in?” 

Nervously, Lammergeier fol- 
lowed behind. Beyond the door, 
things were much as he had last 
seen them, apart from more wear 
and tear. The Babies, adults in 
everything except mentality, were 
being put down for their day- 
time rest. The floor was mark- 
ed with traces of their presence, 
some of the traces none too sav- 
ory; but they themselves were all 
in their oversize cots, cooing or 
complaining according to tem- 
perament. Two hefty male nurs- 
es and one woman were just 
settling the last of them down. 


GALAXY 


Lammergeier stifled a cry of ad- 
jmiration for their devotion; any 
of the Babies would have out- 
weighed him, and it must be a 
terrible task lifting and lowering 
them several times daily. 

The nurses were surprised at 
the entrance of their director and 
his companions, but they re- 
frained from asking questions, 
completed their work on a nod 
from Chen, and went out with 
curious glances. 

r T''he instant the door was shut, 
Murphy marched over to the 
bed of the nearest Baby and 
stared down at him, naked ex- 
cept for a huge diaper. He set his 
memocase on the high metal rail 
intended to prevent the Baby 
toppling out of bed if he rolled 
in his sleep. * 

“And these are the creatures 
you’ve saved to keep alive and 
well for twenty years,” he mur- 
mured, touching the controls on 
the case. “I have to grant that 
they seemed physically sound.” 

“Oh, they are!” Chen hast- 
ened to assure him. “They’ve had 
the best diet, the best medical 
care — not that they need much 
of that; they’re astonishingly 
healthy. If only we could find 
a way to spark their intelli- 
gence!” 

“You say they’re quite mor- 
onic?” Murphy said, stressing the 
last word. 

CHILDREN IN HIDING 


“Completely! Not one of them 
has ever progressed to the stage 
of uttering a recognizable word. 
They coo and cry, and that’s 
the limit of their aspirations.” 

“I think you must be crazy,” 
Murphy said with abrupt cold- 
ness, letting the case fall be- 
side him to the full stretch of his 
arm. He turned to confront them 
directly. 

Lammergeier pushed forward. 
“So we’re crazy, are we?” he 
blurted, unable to restrain him- 
self any longer. “We should have 
killed them off and buried them 
by the thousand, should we? Oh, 
probably it looks that simple 
from Earth! But these are our 
kids. And this is out planet, that 
we’ve sweated and slaved over 
all our lives! How the hell do 
you think we could bring our- 
selves to face the need to ex- 
terminate them because they 
aren’t even useful as animals, 
then pack our gear and quit 
Landfall forever for fear it might 
happen again? We couldn’t! And 
it’s no damned good trying to 
make out we ought to have 
done!” 

“No, I wouldn’t say that,” 
Murphy agreed. “Man is hardly 
a perfect rational animal, is he?” 

Lammergeier shook his head 
dumbly. 

“But I didn’t mean that,” 
Murphy pursued. “What I meant 
was that you’re crazy to think 

51 


that these Babies are mindless.” 
Chen reacted first to that. He 
took half a pace forward. “But 
I assure you, Mr. Murphy, on 
the basis of years of experience, 
that that’s the case! I’ve run 
every test I ever heard of. I 
traced every wild speculation I 
could locate about nonverbal 
intelligence, in the hope they 
might represent a mutation with 
some other faculty equally ser- 
viceable and equally human. I 
drew a blank!” 

“Then that’s where you made 
your worst mistake,” Murphy 
shrugged. “I don’t see that 
there’s much wrong with these 
young men around us.” 

“Of course you can’t see what’s 
wrong!” Lammergeier raged. 
“That’s the whole point!” 

“Then how about this? Mur- 
phy snapped. He rounded on the 
nearest Babies and clapped his 
hands together. “Hey, you! Get 
up! You’ve spent long enough 
lounging around having all your 
wants attended to! There’s work 
to be done — move/” 

The Babies turned their heads. 
There was a sound of sighing. 
Then, one by one, they stretched, 
yawned and vaulted over the 
sides of their cots to land bounc- 
ing on the floor; nineteen speci- 
mens of healthy, muscular 
adulthood absurdly garbed in 
off-white loincloths and safety- 
pins. 

52 


T ammergeier, Chen and Mat- 
ron Hobday were rooted to 
the spot, eyes goggling. Lammer- 
geier found his tongue first. 

“But — ! Did you know about 
this already?” 

Murphy gave a faint smile. 
“You might say that,” he con- 
ceded. 

“Then — is the problem wide- 
spread?” 

“Getting wider all the time.” 
Murphy sounded secretly amus- 
ed. 

Taking it for a patronizing 
comment on the stupidity of col- 
onials, Lammergeier felt a surge 
of anger. “Well, if the problem’s 
already known elsewhere, and 
you came able to solve it with 
no more than a curt tone of 
voice — ” 

“And this,” Murphy put in, 
hefting the memocase. 

“The hell with your gadgetry! 
What I want to know is, why 
Earth let us stew in our own 
juice when they could have had 
the courtesy to let us in on the 
secret!” Lammergeier wanted to 
stamp until the floor gave away. 

“Oh, shut up,” Murphy said 
wearily. “They don’t know about 
it on Earth, so how could they 
have told you! You there?” 

The tallest Baby scratched his 
stomach absently. “What’s this 
work you want done, boss?” he 
inquired in a clear tenor voice. 

“What the hell do you think?” 
GALAXY 


Murphy snarled, “There are three 
quarters of a million of you 
grown to full size now. You 
could have done this job years 
ago. Head Office shouldn’t have 
had to send me to kick you off 
your beds! Go on, start making 
up for lost time!” 

The Baby shrugged, put out 
both hands, and proceeded to 
tear Lammergeier limb from 
limb. 

“And clear up behind you!” 
Murphy added, as he bent to the 
memocase — which of course was 
not one.

When my grave-digging details 
get through, the situation here 
will be back on schedule. The 
ostensible failure of the project 
seems to have been due to noth- 
ing more than an excess in the 
mother-love component of the 
planetwide broadcast from the 
mind-blanketer. This appears to 
have been set too high for fear 
the natives would fight back 
against the Babies when the lat- 
ter showed their hand. The pre- 
caution was needless, and what’s 
more it backfired! instead of re- 
senting the burden the Babies 
placed on them, practically 
everyone on the planet lavished 
such care and adoration on the 
CHILDREN IN HIDING 


little monsters the psychological 
trigger intended to respond to 
parental hatred was never 
tripped. Consequently they stay- 
ed the way they were a full five 
years after they could have tak- 
en over. 

In any case, the drain on the 
planet’s resources and the ex- 
haustion of al'l the intelligent 
adults of the "native species would 
have rendered more than token 
resistance impossible. We can cer- 
tainly go ahead with confidence.

MODERN 

PENITENTIARY 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 


He was the worst criminal the 
world had ever seen — and his 
jailer was in love with him! 


I 

A lone in the comfortable apart - 
ment which was his cell. Dr. 
Joe West chewed the inside of 
his cheek in self-torment. Quiv- 
ering, his scalpel exposed the tiny 
pituitary gland of the Arctic 
Ground Squirrel. 


“Blind fools!” His real guilt 
was so much worse than the 
angry orators in the United Na- 
tions General Assembly had 
shouted. 

Racial murder? Unpredictably, 
twenty-two Canadian Eskimos 
had died. The Ottawa court con- 
victed him of murder. 


54 


“I’m guilty of worse.” His face 
twisted. Less than 30% of the 
Esk women had developed the 
planned uterine infection. Not 
a single Esk died. Their resist- 
ance to human pathogens was so 
much stronger than he expected. 
The Esks continued happily eat- 
ing and breeding and breeding 
and breeding — 

“Damn me! Instead of me 
controlling their birth-rate, I’m 
their Santa Claus!” 

It was his murder trial which 
attracted world-wide attention 
and aid to the hungry Esks. 
Ironically, it was his trial which 
awakened humanitarians and 
politicians to the plight of the 
overcrowding Esks. Rapidly mul- 
tiplying Esks were starving. 

Both the outraged Chinese and 
the embarrassed United States 
were air-delivering food, baby 
clothing, portable barracks. 

“Blind fools! Like providing 
food and shelter for lemmings.” 
Dr. West’s youthful face winced, 
gaunt as a pensioner’s. 

The last rumor Dr. West had 
overheard as he was led to his 
bullet-proof glass booth in the 
Ottawa courtroom for sentenc- 
ing: a Chinese VTOL aircraft 
had “evacuated” more than one 
hundred starving “Eskimos,” 
surely Esks, from Canada’s Boo- 
thia Peninsula. Like an infec- 
tious boil, the population pres- 
sure of the Esks had burst. 

THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


“God! What’s happening out 
there?” Trapped in the New Ot- 
tawa Reformation Center, Dr. 
West knew he should make a 
second attempt to escape — at 
once. 

His cell was frighteningly com- 
fortable. Safe as a womb. Al- 
ready the friendly Staff were 
changing him. 

Outside the Esks would change 
the world. 

'T'he hiss of increasing air pres- 
sure alerted Dr. West that 
the outer door to his suite was 
being opened. Ignoring the Ceil- 
ing Lens, Dr. West hastily 
wrapped the dissected squirrel 
in metallic-green Christmas pa- 
per; he was not allowed news- 
papers. Dropping to his knees, 
he hid the squirrel under the 
compressor. 

As he lurched to the sofa, his 
abdominal incision tugged. His 
heart thudded more quickly than 
the compressor pumping coolant 
through frosty copper tubes past 
his work counter to the huge 
insulated cage. 

It was an ingenious but scary 
means of escape. 

Peering out through the dou- 
ble glass window of the cage, 
a single chilled Arctic Ground 
Squirrel ( Citellus undulatus ) 
still resisted hibernation. The 
other squirrels slept under the 
sawdust. This lonely squirrel 

55 


shrank back as the inner door 
to Dr. West’s suite moved open 
and Nona walked in with a ther- 
apeutic smile. 

His pulse racing, Dr. West 
couldn’t remember whether he’d 
shaved. Every day for a week, 
at 10:00 a.m. she had entered 
his suite, made his bed, done his 
dishes and tried cheerful con- 
versation. 

Her blue uniform no longer 
reminded Dr. West of a guard or 
airline stewardess. Through his 
insane glass wall, he was staring 
at her eyes. 

“Merry Christmas, Student,” 
Nona laughed, but her self- 
assurance visibly fell away. “This 
is supposed to be a present to 
you from the Staff. But I don’t 
know what’s in this package.” 
She wasn’t smiling now. “I didn’t 
have anything to do with it.” 

Dr. West reached for the pack- 
age, which was wrapped in grin- 
ning Santa Claus paper. He felt 
as if he could almost reach Nona 
through his imaginary glass wall. 
His fingers closing around the 
bottle-shaped package touched 
her hand. His muscles tightened. 
After a year alone in Territorial 
Prison, and then in the bullet- 
proof glass booth while on trial, 
and then in Classification Prison, 
always alone and cut off, Dr. 
West could not quite break 
through the illusion there was a 
glass wall — 

56 


“Gurgles like a fifth of rye,” 
he remarked with a weak smile, 
cautiously shaking the package. 

“I doubt that.” Nona sat her- 
self down on the coffee table, 
still breathing hard as if she 
had been hurrying to her hour-a- 
day appointment with him. Al- 
ways she seemed to be perched 
on the coffee table, her knees 
pressed together, her hand tug- 
ging down her blue uniform 
skirt. 

“That’s Christmas on your 
head,” Dr. West stammered, not 
sure what he meant to say. 

Her silvery flower-shaped hair 
decoration of foil, tinsel and 
yellow-green mistletoe rustled 
as she raised her face with dim- 
pled pleasure. “Thank you,” she 
said. 

After a moment she said, 
“There’s still a package in your 
hand.” 

Dr. West’s fingers stripped 
down the red and white Santa 
Claus paper, exposing the clear 
glass neck; he laughed with con- 
fusion. “A fifth of gin?” He star- 
ed at something worm-shaped 
and pink drifting back and forth 
in the alcohol. “I’ll be damned! 
It’s my appendix.” 

“I’m sorry!” Nona blurted. 
“What a horrid thing for the 
Medical Officer to send.” 

At her upturned face, Dr. West 
blinked, more surprised by her 
shocked reaction than by the 

GALAXY 


fact that the Medical Officer 
would send him back his ap- 
pendix for Christmas. Dr. West’s 
smile hardened as he silently 
read the note: Mr. West, our 
pathologist reports — . 

II 

'Tphat first night in his suite, 
Dr. West had lain waiting 
for his fever to rise. The dull 
pain spread. His abdominal mus- 
cles became rigid. He vomited, 
crawling toward the bathroom. 
As he had hoped, the Ceiling 
Lens was transmitting, and thir- 
ty floors below in the basement 
where 240 tally screens were 
banked, the Night Observer no- 
ticed and telephoned the Medi- 
cal Officer. 

Dr. West had expected to be 
rushed out of his solitary cell into 
the elevator, and down, then out 
through the icy Canadian night to 
the hospital building. Apparently 
that was someone’s plan. Perhaps 
an orderly had been bribed. The 
rectangular hospital seemed to 
have more escape possibilities 
than these tall cylindrical tow- 
ers of the New Ottawa Refor- 
mation Center. 

From a distance the towers 
had resembled concrete grain 
elevators. His first glimpse, as 
the armored car delivered him 
toward the penitentiary, had 
shifted from the towers to the 
ME MODERN PENITENTIARY 


Canadians massing in the sleet. 
PRESERVE OUR ESKIMOS, 
a placard read. 

Flailing their signs, the scream- 
ing mob broke through the po- 
lice line and halted the armored 
car with their bodies. SAVE 
OUR ESKIMOS. A sign ham- 
mered against the bullet-proof 
window. HUMAN LIFE IS 
SACRED. A contorted face 
pressed against the glass, recog- 
nized Dr. West. “Kill the bas- 
tard!” 

Dr. West had closed his eyes. 
They were right. 

Shivering inside warm Tower 
#3 that first night, finally alone 
in his solitary suite, still shiver- 
ing Dr. West had hung up his 
gray denim trousers, and the 
capsule fell out of his cuff. He 
had blinked at it. On the pink 
gelatin was scratched HOSP- 
APP. At first he did not realize 
what the APP stood for. With 
irony he thought the capsule 
might contain cyanide from his 
billions of telly admirers who had 
witnessed his trial and conviction 
for genocide and were outraged 
there no longer was a death pen- 
alty in Canada. Their dead Esk- 
imos were lovable people, easily 
idealized. “Tool of capitalist 
genocide!” “Communist fiend!” 
the confused Canadians had 
shouted after him. 

Swiftly, willing to accept what- 
ever it contained. Dr. West had 

57 


gulped the capsule and lain 
down. His actual crime, his in- 
effectiveness was more terrible 
than the billions knew. 

The numbing of death did not 
come. As his temperature rose 
and his symptoms proliferated, 
Dr. West had realized that APP 
stood for appendix. Someone 
was trying to get him out. Some- 
one must believe him. 

TT'ever engulfed him in delirium. 

A potent capsule! He imag- 
ined he saw Eskimos entering his 
suite, and he shouted with terror. 

The Medical Officer’s fingers 
were pressing his rigid abdomen. 
“Nurse, best take a thermometer 
reading from this chap.” 

The massive whiteness of a po- 
lar bear loomed over the Medical 
Officer’s shoulder, and Joe West 
had yelled. 

To his dismay, instead of car- 
rying him out to the hospital, 
gauze-masked monsters wheeled 
a portable operating table into 
his suite. “Best give the patient 
a spinal.” 

Mirrored in the reflector of the 
portable overhead light they were 
turning his body. Their yellow- 
ish rubber hands gleamed. A 
grease pencil marked a line from 
his navel to his hip. He felt the 
numb tugging of the scapel. 

When the appendectomy was 
complete, a masked face had 
bent over him. “I say, West, 

58 


your appendix appears remark- 
ably healthy. In retrospect, your 
symptoms all seem rather odd. 
You’ve made me feel the fool. 
Was this another one of those 
unnecessary operations?” The 
Medical Officer had turned away. 
“Best deliver his appendix to 
the pathologist.” 

Now, for a Christmas present, 
or a warning, the Medical Officer 
had returned his appendix in a 
bottle with a note. 

Mr. West, our pathologist re- 
ports that a foreign substance, 
probably ingested, raised your 
white blood count and induced 
other symptoms typical of peri- 
tonitis. As 'a former medical man, 
you may have a more specific ex- 
planation? 

Why not feign a brain tumor 
next time? We would welcome 
the exercise. Merry Christmas 
from the Staff, New Ottawa Re- 
formation Center. 

P.S. Looking forward to your 
continued presence during the 
New Year. 

Tpvr. West’s bitter grin sagged 
while he turned his head 
from side to side as if searching 
for a window to the Outside. 
Windowless concrete. He stared 
past Nona at the concave wall 
and violently stiffened, his fist 
crushing the note. 

Her voice intruded: “Did he 
write one of his funny notes?” 

GALAXY 


“Funny? My sense of humor’s 
dead. I’m dead. Don’t waste 
your hour in here with me. Don’t 
waste the taxpayers’ money. Get 
out, dammit!” 

Instantly he was sorry — and 
terribly lonely. 

She looked up at him. To his 
surprise, she moved toward him, 
smiling. 

He stiffened. “Get out. While 
you can, go!” he shouted. “Get 
out. I can’t stand your — is it 
sympathy?” 

She edged toward the door but 
turned around, her face solemn. 
“If you want, you can apply for 
someone else, a different social 
Therapist.” 

“No! What choice has a rat 
in a trap?” He looked her up 
and down. “Bait, is that what 
you are? Get out.” 

“After you’ve been here a 
while,” she answered softly, 
“you’ll realize this is like your 
home. You’ll feel differently. 
Please, if you want to — you can 
apply for a different — ” 

“No, dammit, I want to get 
out of here! At least you — get 
out!” 

After he had caught his breath, 
he realized she was still stand- 
ing there. Trying to hold his voice 
from trembling, he said: “You 
don’t scare very easily, do you?” 

“Sometimes. But not of you.” 

“I’m sorry. But I’ve got to 
get out of here. I forget you have 
THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


problems, too. Here you are a 
woman alone all day with us 
murderers and maniacs.” 

“I’m not alone.” 

“Do you mean that physically 
or spiritually? Outside, they’d 
lynch me,” Dr. West said final- 
ly. “In here you people try to 
make me feel comfortable but 
won’t even tell me the news.” 
Wryly he smiled. “There was 
a prophetess named Cassandra. 
Now I know why she wailed. A 
man, a prophet, would have bat- 
tered his head against a marble 
pillar. Cassandra could fortell 
what was going to destroy Troy, 
but no one would listen. She 
warned them not to drag the 
wooden horse into Troy. No 
wonder she wailed. Helplessly 
knowing what is going to hap- 
pen, but not being able to do 
anything is so much more pain- 
ful than not knowing!” 

& C A ren’t you being rather dra- 
matic,” she remarked. 
“That wooden horse, isn’t it in 
a school book about Greece?” 
Turning away from his tormented 
face, she walked into the kitch- 
enette and opened the sliding 
door which concealed his sink 
and electric stove. She boiled 
water. “Instant coffee?” 

“So you’re the unshakable 
type,” he laughed bitterly. “Must 
help in a madhouse like this.” 

“I believe in living along from 

59 


day to day.” She sat down on 
the other end of the sofa and 
smiled at him over her steaming 
cup. “Now that you’ve had your 
tantrum for this day, I’m going 
to tell you something which may 
give you a second one.” 

“No, I’m through,” he said, 
smiling faintly. “Your child psy- 
chology has overpowered me.” 
“The Pharmacist asked me to 
ask you — ” she put down her 
coffee cup — “if a hypodermic 
was, shall we say, overlooked 
and left in your cell. During the 
first three nights after your ap- 
pendix operation the nurse gave 
you sleeping injections. In a 
government institution like this 
everything has to be accounted 
for — even if it’s all used up like 
a one-shot disposable hypo. Any- 
way, the nurse must have be- 
come confused in her equipment 
count. A used hypo is missing. 
Of course she had other pa- 
tients to visit, but you’re the 
newest in this tower; and this has 
never happened before, so the 
Pharmacist wonders, if you still 
have the hypo, would you return 
it?” 

“I haven’t any hypo.” 

“Good. I’ll ask the Recreation 
Officer if he’ll start the search 
in someone else’s suite. The Ad- 
ministratrix has told him to 
search, so he has to search.” 
“That’s all right.” Dr. West 
leaned back on the sofa. “The

Recreation Officer can start here. 
I won’t feel persecuted. He’s my 
buddy,” Dr. West bluffed and 
nodded at the insulated cage, 
the compressor, the centrifuge, 
the gleaming glass equipment, 
all of which the Recreation Offi- 
cer cheerfully and ingeniously 
had acquired for him — with Dr. 
West’s own impounded funds. 

T'vr. West’s heart palpitated as 
he remembered the dissect- 
ed squirrel concealed under the 
compressor. But he went on 
talking. “The Recreation Officer 
showed the Administratrix my 
hibernation-study proposal. I 
may be repeating old metabolic 
and glandular research, but it’s 
more therapeutic for me than 
weaving baskets. He says he got 
her approval by suggesting Tow- 
er #3 surely must be more en- 
lightened than Alcatraz — some 
prison where they once let an 
old lifer raise canaries. So the 
Recreation Officer’s my buddy, 
and I raise squirrels. He’s wel- 
come to search. When is he like- 
ly to?” 

“He’ll probably start some- 
place else.” She put down her 
coffee. “At least two students 
who’ve been sick and visited by 
the nurse are former drug ad- 
dicts and might steal hypos, I 
suppose.” She looked solemnly 
at him, and he was surprised 
how small she really was. Her 

GALAXY 


hand on the couch was fragile 
compared with his. “The truth 
is”, she laughed, “some men in 
this tower are — rather scary. 
That’s why in your suite I feel 
so much better — with you.” 

Dr. West recognized the pitch, 
the helpless bit, and he almost 
smiled with pleasure. He not 
only felt protective, he felt al- 
most possessive. From the sofa, 
she looked up at him, smiling 
with her eyes as if she knew 
that he knew, and he felt his 
imaginary glass wall dissolving. 

Ill

6 6TT7'hat are you smiling 
* ’ about?” she said. 

“I was just thinking that 
we — ” 

The outer door hissed. Dr. 
West’s muscle contracted like a 
criminal’s caught in the act. The 
inner door shoved open. 

“May I come in?” said the 
Recreation Officer, already in 
and sniffing his toothbrush mus- 
tache in his most characteristic 
gesture. He had an old face, but 
his mustache and hair were black 
with dye. “I can come back lat- 
er.” His unreadable gaze bounced 
off Nona’s face, and he stared at 
Dr. West. “I’ve been asked, shall 
we say ordered, to search for a 
small useless, uh, item in your 
suite.” 

Dr. West grinned. “Nona told 


me it was a hypo. Feel free to 
search away. I’ll help any way 
I can, but I haven’t got a hypo 
for you. I wish there was a prison 
grapevine so I could tell you 
who’s got the hypo.” 

The Recreation Officer failed 
to smile. To Dr. West’s surprise 
the Recreation Officer’s usually 
sly sense of humor was gone, 
blank. _ ‘ 

“Would it be possible to start 
with another suite?” Dr. West 
asked apologetically. “This is my 
therapeutic hour. You said you 
could come back later.” 

“No, I’m already here, so I’ll 
start here,” the Recreation Offi- 
cer replied. “She can vacuum 
this dirty floor whether I’m here 
or not.” 

Dr. West tried again. “Sir, if 
you could come back later, after 
Nona’s gone — I need to talk 
with you alone.” 

Dr. West was careful not to 
glance toward the compressor. 
Beneath it the dissected squirrel 
was hidden, and Dr. West was 
afraid Nona’s reaction would be 
revulsion when it was found. He 
thought the Recreation Officer’s 
reaction would have been no 
more than mild interest if the 
dissected squirrel had been in 
plain sight on the work counter. 


T Tnfortunately, Dr. West had 
^ concealed the dead squirrel, 
as if guilty of something. Now

) 


the Recreation Officer’s reaction 
when he found the bloody pack- 
age might be suspicion. Dr. West 
knew the Recreation Officer 
lacked the medical background to 
put two and two together. But 
if the squirrel were shown to the 
Medical Officer, that intelligent 
man would recognize this was 
not merely a squirrel autopsy. 
The squirrel had been cut open 
for another purpose. The Medi- 
cal Officer would ponder this 
problem, and knowing Dr. West’s 
controlling motivation was es- 
cape — 

“ — in the kitchenette,” the 
Recreation Officer was saying, 
opening and closing drawers. 
“You haven’t even done his dish- 
es yet, Nona.” He opened a cup- 
board. “A more logical hiding 



62 


GALAXY 


place for a hypo would be — 
the bathroom.” 

Dr. West began to perspire. 
He knew he needed to maneuver 
both of them out of the suite in 
order to dispose of that dissected 
squirrel. If the Recreation Officer 
continued searching, eventually 
he would discover the body of 
the squirrel. 

The Recreation Officer spent 
a surprisingly long time bang- 
ing around in the bathroom. All 
it contained was a medicine cab- 
inet, toilet, basin and tub. The 
bathroom was located in the nar- 
row inner end of the suite. 

Whenever he had sat in the 



tub Dr. West could hear the eight 
elevators humming up and down 
the central shaft of the cylindri- 
cal tower. His thirtieth floor 
suite was shaped like an eighth 
of a pie. The center of the pie 
was occupied by the huge open 
shaft, which contained the ele- 
vators and the air-conditioning 
ducts. The elevators were code- 
controlled. To escape without 
an elevator would be a long fall. 

The Recreation Officer emerg- 
ed from the bathroom, smiling 
beneath his toothbrush mustache. 
“I took the liberty of searching 
your medicine cabinet.” His 
smile widened. “I deduce from 
the bottles and tubes that you 
suffer from piles.” His smile 
spread so wide it almost appeared 
malicious. “Not a very romantic 
ailment for a world famous Arc- 
tic adventurer. Or for a convict- 
ed mass murderer.” 

Dr. West blinked with surprise. 
Until now, the Recreation Officer 
always had treated him with 
human respect, never mentioned 
his crime. 

“You’ve murdered more peo- 
ple,” the Recreation Officer re- 
marked, “than the rest of the 
Students in this tower combined, 
and you top it off by stealing 
a worthless one-shot hypo.” 

“I haven’t got your hypo.” 

“You’re a disgusting example 
of futility. Do you know, if you’d 
simply applied for a hypo, if you 

63 


THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


needed a hypo, I would have 
purchased you a dozen. But dur- 
ing your second or third night 
in the tower you didn’t know 
that yet, did you? So you stole 
one.” 

T^vr. West did not reply. He 
was wondering if the Recrea- 
tion Officer had just planted a 
hypo in the bathroom. From a 
friend, the Recreation Officer in- 
explicably had turned into tor- 
mentor. 

“I brought you scalpels, didn’t 
I,” the Recreation Officer per- 
sisted. “Enough scalpels to 
butcher a dozen women.” 

“Please, sir,” Nona protested. 

“Don’t you approve of hum- 
or?” the Recreation Officer ask- 
ed. “You and I are both on the 
Staff — to assist in therapy, to 
make the Students happy. Isn’t 
that right?” 

The Recreation Officer strode 
across the room toward the en- 
try and kicked Dr. West’s bed. 
“What do they expect me to 
do. split the mattress to find your 
hypo?” 

“I haven’t got the hypo.” Dr. 
West stepped forward, his sweat- 
ing face twisted in an answering 
smile. “From what I’ve been 
told, the policy of this prison, 
excuse me, educational institu- 
tion, toward the so-called Stu- 
dent is — ” 

“ — to treat the disturbed stu- 


dent with respect”, the Recrea- 
tion Officer interrupted in a sing- 
song voice. “Make him feel this 
is home. Rebuild his feeling of 
inner worth. Nona, have you 
been reciting your book to this 
filthy murderer?” 

“No, she hasn’t, Dad,” Dr. 
West retorted, smiling harder, 
losing control. “You did, remem- 
ber? Where’s your warm Father- 
Image today? The student is to 
be drawn into a warm family- 
like relationship and, I quote, 
encouraged to lower his defensive 
barriers. In the Ottawa Reforma- 
tion Center he is considered re- 
born. It is the purpose of the 
Staff to offer the Student so warm 
and reassuring an emotional en- 
vironment that he will find the 
inner support he failed to feel 
in his childhood. Strengthened, 
basically changed, he can re- 
turn to society. Isn’t that right, 
Dad?” 

“Back off!” The Recreation 
Officer spoke like an angrily 
barking dog. “Because you’re 
younger, stronger, more sarcastic 
doesn’t mean you can’t be 
spanked! Figuratively spanked 
— no. Literally spanked!” He 
walked away from Dr. West, 
lifted the top of the insulated 
hibernation cage and plunged 
his arm into it. 

The one conscious squirrel 
jumped aside and squealed with 
fright. 


64 


GALAXY 


F^or the last minute, Dr. West 
1 had been considering goad- 
ing the Recreation Officer to 
such anger he would stop the 
search and rush out of the suite. 
But now Dr. West’s heart was 
hammering, his fists clenched, 
and he realized his own self-con- 
trol was so uncertain that the 
Recreation Officer might be suc- 
cessfully goading him. Perhaps 
the Recreation Officer’s strange 
behavior was intended to goad 
him to violence. Then would he 
be transferred? Was that the 
Recreation Officer’s intent? 

Nona, her face pale, her lips 
narrow, was shaking her head 
in warning at Dr. West. Silently 
they watched while the Recrea- 
tion Officer distastefully lifted 
out a handful of sawdust. 

“What a stench! I noticed it 
as soon as I entered your suite. 
Are you sure they’re not decay- 
ing instead of hibernating?” The 
Recreation Officer reached deep- 
er into the cage. “This stench, is 
it to discourage us from looking 
for the hypo? Is it dead?” 

By the tail, the Recreation 
Officer raised a hibernating 
ground squirrel. “Since you for- 
merly were an expert on Arctic 
ecology, among other things, I 
would have expected you to play 
with something more typically 
Arctic. Such as those beastly lit- 
tle lemmings which you reputed- 
ly compared to Eskimos.” 

THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


“To Esks. I explained to you 
the differences between Eskimos 
and Esks. I talked for hours when 
you listened so sympathetically, 
Dad,” Dr. West added savagely. 
“You ought to be intelligent 
enough to differentiate between 
Eskimos and Esks. As for lem- 
mings, they don’t hibernate.” 

The Recreation Officer shrug- 
ged, dropped the limp squirrel 
back into the cage. “Dear me, 
you’re right. You told me no 
Arctic animal truly hibernates 
— except these putrid ground 
squirrels. I’m not going to search 
through this stinking mess for 
the hypo. I’m going to recom- 
mend that the contents of this 
cage be emptied down the incin- 
erator.” 

“I haven’t got the hypo,” Dr. 
West repeated, watching the 
Recreation Officer step to the 
wider end of the suite where the 
compressor chugged erratically. 

Concealed under the compres- 
sor was the dissected squirrel. 
The compressor unit vibrated 
against the white concrete wall. 

The wall was smooth concrete, 
slightly concave because it also 
was the outer wall of the tower. 
Like a cylindrical concrete grain 
elevator, the tower had no win- 
dows, and its exterior construc- 
tion was both economical and 
escape-proof, and functional in 
other ways . 

The Recreation Officer glanc- 

65 


ed Irom the compressor to the 
concave wall spread out behind 
it like a wide-angle screen. “This 
noisy compressor must intrude 
into the corner of the picture. 
Or do you never turn on the 
projector any more? For emo- 
tionally disturbed students like 
you I recommend a minimum 
of two hours per day.” The Rec- 
reation Officer smiled infuriating- 
ly at him. 

IV 

D r. West stepped violently 
toward the compressor, the 
Recreation Officer and the blank 
wall. At first, while recovering 
from his appendectomy, he had 
lain for hours watching the mov- 
ing scenery on that wall, his only 
window. Trying to ignore the 
subliminal cartoons pressing him 
back against childhood, his fav- 
orite escape had been following 
movies of the surf flashing white 
along the Northern California 
coastline on the wall. At first 
he’d stared helplessly. The arti- 
ficial window had been his only 
release from claustrophobia. 

“Nona, don’t leave,” Dr. West 
said, without looking back, know- 
ing she was still sitting on the 
coffee table. This caused the Rec- 
reation Officer to glance back 
at her. 

Dr. West’s hand darted into the 
compressor case. 

66 


The compressor unit consisted 
of an electric motor humming at 
high R.P.M.’s and revolving a 
series of larger and larger gears, 
the largest turning least rapidly 
and most powerfully, forcing the 
piston of the air compressor in 
and out no faster than a fright- 
ened heart. Last week, when Dr. 
West had assembled this jerry- 
built contraption, he had set an 
oiling can to drip at five minute 
intervals on the moving elbow of 
the compressor, and now, in this 
instant, his hand reset the noz- 
zle of the can to dribble rapidly. 

As the Recreation Officer turn- 
ed back to the compressor, a fine 
mist of oil rose against his blue 
uniform. Dr. West already was 
walking away. 

There was a moment of silence 
as if the Recreation Officer had 
not yet realized what had hap- 
pened. “Your damned machine 
is leaking! There’s little drop- 
lets all over my coat.” 

At this, Dr. West turned back. 
“Either oil or coolant. If it’s 
coolant — the coolant is strongly 
alkaline, irritating to the lungs.” 
He wrapped his handkerchief 
protectively around his hand and 
rushed at the compressor, turn- 
ing his head aside, as if from poi- 
son gas, holding his breath while 
he readjusted the oiler to its 
former rate of one drop of oil 
every five minutes. “The coolant 
will decompose cloth. It should 

GALAXY 


be soaped off the skin as soon as 
possible.” 

The Recreation Officer sniff- 
ed the back of his hand and 
glared from Dr. West to Nona. 
“The least you could do is help 
me search,” he accused her. 
“Damn, my hand is burning!” 
Seated on the low coffee table, 
Nona stared down at her own 
hands, cupped on her lap. “Sir, 
my job’s to maintain a close rela- 
tionship with my Students. The 
Administratrix never asks us to 
involve ourselves in searches.” 
“You have the soul of a — 
They let anybody into Civil Ser- 
vice these days!” The Recreation 
Officer dashed out of the suite, 
scrubbing his hand with his hand- 
kerchief, and the elevator hum- 
med. 

itT’m sorry,” Nona murmured. 

-®- “He’s never acted before as 
if making a search was — be- 
neath his dignity. Normally he’s 
a nice man. Maybe he’s having 
problems outside — 

“Oh, sure. Nice man.” Dr. West 
sat down on the sofa in order 
to stop shaking. “The Staff has 
to stick together.” 

“I’m telling you the truth. I’ve 
never seen him like this.” Sud- 
denly she smiled. “On duty, 
we’re supposed to be saints and 
let you Students have all the tan- 
trums.” 

Perched on the low coffee ta- 
THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


ble, she pressed her legs togeth- 
ed and tugged down at her skirt. 
She was peering toward the com- 
pressor. “Is that a Christmas 
present underneath? Sort of 
green shiny paper.” 

“You’ll have to wait till 
Christmas to find out,” Dr. West 
said and reached forward, seizing 
her hand before she could stand 
all the way up and escape to look 
under the compressor. 

Pulled forward off balance, she 
raised her eyebrows as she smil- 
ed at him, and plumped down be- 
side him on the sofa. “You didn’t 
need to let go of my hand.” 

Dr. West grinned with em- 
barrassment, knowing he should 
try to get her to leave the suite 
as quickly as possible, so he 
could dispose of the squirrel. “Do 
you think my ex-buddy, the 
Recreation Officer, is likely to 
pop back in here unannounced?” 
She shrugged, jiggling her 
shirt waist. “He might.” She 
smiled, glancing at him from the 
corners of her eyes. “I don’t 
think he will, though. He prob- 
ably went down to the base- 
ment to wash and gulp coffee 
and brood. This was supposed 
to be his free hour. That’s why 
he was assigned to help search. 
Next hour he has to be smiling 
again and sympathetic because 
he must face his next appoint- 
ment with another of you exas- 
perating Students.” 


67 


“Exasperated is the word. I 
feel like I’m in a fishbowl.” Dr. 
West jerked his head at the Ceil- 
ing Lens. 

Nona looked up, then down 
as if she was staring through 
thirty floors to the basement. 
“Privacy is mostly in your head. 
There are 240 screens down there, 
but only one observer on duty 
since the budget cut. Mainly the 
observer keeps his attention on 
the red-tagged screens, the new 
admissions. After all, they’re the 
men most apt to set their suites 
on fire or slash their wrists or — 
uh, develop appendicitis.” 

D r. West almost smiled at 
that. Then he asked a lead- 
ing question. “When the clock 
says it’s night, and the luminous 
panels dim, and finally I turn 
out my reading light, there’s still 
a dim red glow in the dark. I 
deduce I’m also spied on by in- 
frared transmission?” 

“You are a bashful one! The 
night observer has only one set 
of eyes. He’s worked here for 
years, and he’s seen everything. 
He’s so bored, he’s slyly wired 
one telly to watch outside hock- 
ey games.” She giggled. “It takes 
my own inside alarm system to 
get any protection from him.” 

Dr. West laughed in surprise. 
"Inside alarm? Don’t tell me, if 
a buxom member of the Staff is 
grabbed by a Student and squeez- 
68 


ed, does that set off her built-in 
electronic alarm button, gongs 
clanging, red lights flashing — ” 

“You tease! That depends on 
the member of the Staff. Nona 
stood up unexpectedly. 

As if in pain, Dr. West leaped 
to his feet, reaching for her el- 
bow. But her other hand press- 
ed lightly against his chest, and 
her gaze shifted from his eyes 
to someplace over his shoulder. 

“The clock says your time’s 
up.” 

“Listen, Nona, seriously, I 
need you now.” He was startled 
that he was begging. 

“I wish I could stay, but I’m 
hired to look after my students 
equally. I wish I could stay, but 
my ll:00-till-12:00 man is ex- 
pecting me. It’s his hour. He’s 
a terribly nervous, disturbed old 
man. He has no inner resources 
at all. He’s sitting there expect- 
ing me — ” 

“But what about my hour? 
That damned Recreation Officer 
used up my whole hour bumbling 
around in here. Listen you 
wouldn’t understand that I’ve 
been hung up in — hell. I’ve 
been dead until today, and now 
I need you.” 

She stepped close to him. “I’ll 
be back tomorrow. Since you’re 
described in the Files as a cere- 
bral type, you can get along,” she 
teased, then added seriously: 
“I’m so happy you came out of 

GALAXY 


your withdrawal.” She smiled 
again. “Some silly-billies on the 
Staff were making bets you would 
turn into a vegetable.” 

“A vegetable? Listen, tell your 
1 1 :00-till-12 :00 man I’ll trade 
my whole hour tomorrow for 
thirty of his minutes today, 
now.” 

“I’m flattered — I think. But 
lie’s unadaptable. I’ll dicker with 
him for you, but don’t hold your 
breath. I won’t be back for at 
least a half hour, if at all — 
lover.” 

“Dammit, Nona,” Dr. West al- 
most grabbed for her, then 
laughed wryly, trying to hide 
himself behind a sense of humor. 
“You’re playing with dynamite. 
Nona, is that what you love — 
playing with human dynamite?” 
“That’s my job. I’m supposed 
to civilize you.” She winked and 
went out through the hissing 
door. 

V 


\ lone, but perhaps not unseen, 
* Dr. West was careful not to 
glance at the Ceiling Lens. To 
conceal what he wanted to do, 
he knew that turning off the 
lights in the suite during waking 
hours would be the wrong move. 
That simply would attract the 
attention of the observer. Inno- 
cently he ambled toward the 
compressor, knelt and removed 
THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


the gleaming green package, and 
walked to the sink. He went 
through the motions of washing 
the dishes Nona had neglected 
to wash, and in the sink he cut 
the ground squirrel into quar- 
ters and ground it down the dis- 
posal, all the while bending over 
the sink, obscuring his actions 
from the observer, who might be 
watching, but more likely not. 

Dr. West did not glance at 
the hiding place of the steel 
needle he had removed from the 
hypo. The needle was sticking 
in the fiberboard partition be- 
tween the kitchenette and the 
bathroom. He had extracted the 
nail which originally supported 
the lightly framed print of a 
voyageur portaging a canoe. The 
screw-in base of the hypodermic 
needle now served the same pur- 
pose as had the head of the 
nail. Thus the needle was con- 
cealed in plain sight. 

Two weeks ago, Dr. West had 
smashed the relatively large plas- 
tic plunger of the hypo for which 
they now were searching and 
flushed it down the toilet. 

While in bed after his ap- 
pendectomy, he had confused the 
nurse in her hypo count. Like the 
old shell game. Having stolen a 
full hypo rattier than the empty 
they thought was missing, he had 
injected its content into his emp- 
ty nose-drops bottle, which stood 
on a shelf in the medicine cab- 

69 


inet next to his eye-drops bot- 
tle, which he had filled with a 
second sedative injection the fol- 
lowing night while the nurse’s 
attention was distracted by a 
white wad of paper he had rico- 
cheted off the concave wall — 
after telling the nurse he had 
seen a white mouse in his cell. 

Now Dr. West visualized the 
Ceiling Lens above his head with- 
out looking at it. If he stacked 
the kitchen chair on top of the 
coffee table and climbed up and 
taped a paper towel over the 
Ceiling Lens, the blank-out prob- 
ably would attract the attention 
of the observer, who might send 
someone to investigate which 
would be most embarrassing. 

A shy and difficult man, Dr. 
West wanted privacy. He need- 
ed privacy. 

Even the bathroom lacked pri- 
vacy. There was a separate Ceil- 
ing Lens in there. Dr. West 
blinked in realization. The Staff 
all had said there were 240 telly 
screens in the basement. The 
tower was 30 stories high with 8 
pie-shaped suites to a floor, so 
that there must be 240 suites. 
But there were two Ceiling Lens- 
es per suite, one in the main 
room, one in the bathroom, so 
why weren’t there 480 screens 
in the basement? 

Wrong! He had forgotten the 
third Ceiling Lens in the en- 
trance passageway between the 
70 


inner and outer doors. It was 
to reveal attempted escapes or 
ambushes by Students who had 
gained the code for opening the 
inner door. Why weren’t there 
720 screens in the basement? 

A s his hypothesis germinated, 
Dr. West smiled. One Ceil- 
ing Lens was in the main room 
of the studio apartment, the sec- 
ond in the bathroom and the 
third in the entry hall next to 
the bathroom in the narrow end 
of the semi-pie-shaped suite, a 
total of three Ceiling Lenses per 
suite. Therefore, there should be 
3 times 240 telly screens in the 
basement, a total of 720 screens. 
But there were only 240 screens. 
Dr. West squinted, trying to vis- 
ualize how the designers of the 
remote T.V. system managed to 
project 720 pictures to only 240 
receiving sets. He nodded. From 
each suite 3 pictures were trans- 
mitted onto one screen. 

In televising baseball games, it 
was customary to show the pitch- 
er winding up and at the same 
time in the comer of the screen 
show a separate picture from a 
separate camera of the runner 
taking his lead off of first base. 

Dr. West assumed that the 
pictures from his bathroom and 
from the entry hall were pro- 
jected as overlaps in two corners 
of the main picture from his 
suite. Thus, very likely there 

GALAXY 


were two privacy spots within 
the main room of his suite. But 
which two corners of the four 
comers of the screen, which two 
corners of the main room would 
contain this privacy overlap? 

Unfortunately, the shape of 
the main room was not square 
and could not fill a square telly 
screen. From the concave, white 
outside wall of the suite, the 
two side walls tapered inward. 
The slice of pie narrowed where 
the bathroom and the entry hall 
stood side-by-side, both abut- 
ting the central elevator shaft. 

If, on the telly screen, the 
bathroom and entry hall were 
moved down and out to the 
corners of the screen, there would 
be only a partial overlap be- 
cause the main room was nar- 
rowest at the top of the screen. 
But there still would be some 
overlap — some place to hide 
from the Observer. 

Dr. West walked into the bath- 
room. It was about eight feet 
long. At is wider end, it was five 
feet wide. He glanced out at 
the kitchenette in the main room. 
On the T.V. screen, if the bath- 
room were moved down into the 
unfilled corner of the screen, it 
would overlap with the china 
cabinet, the dumbwaiter pipe 
which delivered frozen foods and 
his refrigerator. 

Since the private actions Dr. 
West had in mind couldn’t be 
THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


conducted in such a small re- 
frigerator, he walked to the other 
side of the main room, near the 
inner entry door. 

The entry hall also appeared 
to be five feet wide, and he sup- 
posed it was the same length as 
the bathroom, eight feet. He 
looked back. The coffee table, 
sofa, easy chair and standing 
lamp were grouped near the 
center of the main room. Beside 
him, his bed already stood 
against the side wall, but ex- 
posed because it was too far 
down on the T.V. screen. It was 
too near the wide, white pro- 
jection wall to be in the telly 
overlap. 

Qtanding with his back to the 
^ bed and his calves pressed 
against the foot of the bed, 
imperceptably Dr. West pushed 
the bed' along the side wall until 
the head of the bed was near 
the entry door. If he moved the 
bed and closer, Nona wouldn’t 
be able to squeeze through the 
partially blocked door. Neverthe- 
less, virtually the entire bed 
should be concealed by the over- 
lapping picture transmitted from 
the entry hall. In the upper left 
hand corner of the telly screen 
in the basement, the bed would 
be hidden ... he hoped. 

Because he was by training a 
conscientious man, he began to 
cross-check. He stared at the 

71 


entry door. Perhaps, the Ceil- 
ing Lens in the entry hall only 
operated when someone was en- 
tering? Not likely. More threat- 
ening was the probability that 
the suite could be scanned. By 
throwing a switch, the Observer 
could shift the overlapping pic- 
tures from the upper corners of 
the screen to the lower corners. 
With so many unknowns and 
variables, there might be even 
more embarrassing possibilities. 
“Dammit, there’s more than one 
way to skin a cat.” 

Dr. West smiled with excite- 
ment, hurried across the suite to 
his work counter and collected 
a ball of twine, a scalpel and 
some safety pins. On his trip 
back to the bed he dragged his 
wooden work chair. Listening for 
the hiss of the outer door, he 
pushed down the pillow and set 
up the chair on top of the bed. 
He tied two chair legs to the 
tubular iron head of the bed- 
stead. 

Hastily, he stretched a string 
from the high back of the an- 
chored chair down over the bed to 
its tubular iron foot. Fumbling 
with knots, spreading blankets 
over the string, pinning blank- 
ets together, pinning edges of 
blankets to the mattress, he 
worked as rapidly as a camper 
when the raindrops begin to fall. 

His face contracted with un- 
certainty. That two-faced, un- 
72 


predictable Recreation Officer 
might return — 

The outer door hissed, and Dr. 
West jumped like a man awak- 
ened by an alarm clock. Across 
the suite he carried the scalpel 
he had used to cut string to the 
work counter and turned, breath- 
ing hard, as the inner door open- 
ed. 

“Surprise,” she laughed. “My 
ll:00-till-12:00 man was so 
grumpy when I asked him why 
he hadn’t shaved he said I was 
a worse nagger than his daugh- 
ter. My heavens, he would have 
given you the rest of his hour. 
But he’ll feel differently tomor- 
row, so I traded him your hour 
tomorrow for his 45 minutes left 
You’re looking at me like my 
eye-shadow’s on upside-down.” 
She giggled. “I talk too much. I 
don’t know why I should be in 
a tizzy, but whenever — well, 
we don’t really know each other. 
We’re friends, but we’re still sort 
of — strangers.” 

As Dr. West walked toward 
her, she stepped sideways, and 
the back of her leg came in con- 
tact with the bed. She whirled, 
startled. 

tCAyTy heavens! A tent!” She 
pealed with laughter. “A 
tent,” she giggled. “I’m going 
to have to explain a few things 
to you. You’re so new here you 
don’t know the rules.” Then her 

GALAXY 


laughter stopped. “I’m sorry. 
I’m not laughing at you. I’m 
laughing at the tent. I think 
it’s cute.” 

Dr. West took hold of her 
upper arm. 

“You don’t need to look so 
serious and earth-shaking,” she 
breathed. “Life should be fun. 
It is fun, a tent! You are the 
most ingenious man I ever did 
see. Safety pins! A tent flap. 
Wasn’t Omar Khayyam a tent- 
maker, too?” 

She put her head inside the 
tent “Oops, am I psychic? I 
never did make your bed. I 
talk too much, don’t I?”' Head 
first she vanished into the tent, 
as Dr. West’s hand guided her. 

Forgetting even a sidewise 
glance at the door, Dr. West fol- 
lowed, the tent shaking as he 
disappeared under the blanket 
room. From the Ceiling Lens 
only the tent was visible. 

“My heavens,” her voice em- 
erged from the tent, “a chair for 
a tent pole! Not so fast! It’s 
crowded in here. You have lots 
of ingenuity, but . Oh.” 

“I’m sorry, such a hurry,” Dr. 
West’s voice gasped. “More than 
a year I’ve been alone, Nona, 
trapped in jails alone.” 

“That’s all right, lover. Let 
me rub your neck, your back and 
in a little while — ” 

“A year is so long for a live 
man. No, a dead man.” 

THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


“Well, now, I wouldn’t say 
you were quite dead,” she gig- 
gled. 

“But a whole year! A year 
passes. What’s a year.” He laugh- 
ed wryly, “I shouldn't fed sorry 
for myself. Those Mars expedi- 
tions were gone far more than a 
year, and married men at that 
Listen, I feet better. I can take 
anything.” 

“Now you’re cheering up. Al- 
ready you’re changing for the 
better. I may not accomplisUi 
much in life,” she said, “but at 
least I’m accomplishing some- 
thing when you smile, student. 
Squeeze me. This your chance 
to change, and you’ll change, 
really change and return to the 
world. We Canadians do like to 
think we’re somewhat enlighten- 
ed. After you graduate, lover — 
remember me.” 

CC /Graduate, hell!” Dr. West’s 

'“-^voice blurted. “Sentenced 
to life!” 

“No, you’re not. You can’t be. 
All Ottawa sentences are in- 
determinate.” 

“I’m not a fool! I know I’ll 
never be freed.” 

“You have the same right,” her 
voice exclaimed unsurely, “to 
graduate as any other student. 
I’m sure you must. Why else 
would the staff go to all the 
trouble and expense of getting 
you all that equipment, the cage, 

73 


the compressor? It’s occupational 
therapy. The Recreation Offi- 
cer — ” 

“That two-faced psycho? Not 
only did he try to humiliate me 
in front of you, he showed a 
vicious attitude toward you.” 

“Please,” she protested, “you 
already have enough adjustment 
problems without developing a 
persecution complex. The Rec- 
reation Officer just had a bad 
day. Even Recreation Officers 
are human.” 

“He’s not your husband, is 
he?” 

“What? What a stupid and un- 
expected question! Certainly he’s 
not my husband. Just because I 
have a ring on my finger doesn’t 
mean — well, why don’t you 
simply try to enjoy life here in 
your suite.” 

“And don’t ask personal ques- 
tions,” Dr. West’s voice filled 
in. 

“No, I’m happy to answer per- 
sonal questions. We’re in an 
awfully personal position right 
now, and you can get as personal 
with me as you want — if you’ll 
promise me you’ll let the Rec- 
reation Officer start out again 
tomorrow with a clean slate. All 
is forgiven?” 

“Could it be that he’s jealous 
of me?” 

“Uh-uh. I’m also Den Moth- 
er to five other students. Pie’s 
never acted this way before. I’m 

74 


sure he’s not jealous. I only 
know the man in a professional 
way, and he’s rather old and 
quite professional.” 

“Not today he wasn’t profes- 
sional,” Dr. West’s voice insisted, 
“He didn’t even finish searching 
my suite. What has he got, a 
triple personality? At first, af- 
ter my appendix operation, he 
showed no real interest in me. 
He wanted me to take up micro- 
scopy as a hobby merely because 
Tower #3 happened to have an 
unused microscope.” 

“Yes, my microscope boy 
graduated. He has a technical 
job in Sasketchawan Oil Fields,” 
she said proudly. “Oil core drill- 
ing samples are full of the tiny 
shells of — He wrote me a beau- 
tiful letter.” 

“I told the Recreation Officer, 
for my occupational therapy I 
didn’t want to weave baskets,” 
Dr. West’s voice swept on. “I 
wanted to review a line of re- 
search begun when I was Direc- 
tor of Oriental Population Prob- 
lems Research at the University 
of California.”

6 C T% jf y heavens, what has pop- 
ulation problems got to 
do with hibernation?” 

“Nothing, except that birth and 
growth and hibernation all are 
dependent on glandular activity. 

GALAXY 


My original medical specialty 
was endocrinology. Glands. But 
as I was saying — all of a sudden 
the Recreation Officer took a 
personal interest in me, went 
to great trouble to acquire equip- 
ment for me, told me how he 
cut through red tape. We had 
long talks. He was interested in 
the squirrels. I thought he was 
my buddy.” 

“He just got up on the wrong 
side of his bed this morning. His 
bunk, perhaps,” she laughed. 
“He’s a retired naval officer. 
Your navy, by the way. But he’s 
Canadian born.” 

“Born in hell,” Dr. West’s 
voice muffled. 

“Mmm, that’s better. Don’t 
nibble too hard. Forget, mm, 
everything. Think about me. Has 
all that isolation made you too 
sensitive? See — you’re ticklish. 
Lover, that big white square, that 
scar on your leg — ?” 

“You’re warm and smooth, the 
end of the world.” 

“What do you mean by that?” 
“I don’t know,” Dr. West’s 
voice breathed. 

“My heavens, you’re certainly 
trying to find out,” her voice 
squealed in delighted alarm. 

Dr. West’s voice hoarsened. 
“Listen, I feel, Nona, Nona — ” 
“Yes, that’s it, wonderful — ” 
From the tent for a little while 
there was no coherent conversa- 
tion and finally quietness. 

THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


“Darling, so nice — ” her voice 
sighed. “So relaxed.” 

“Nona, I feel wonderful,” Dr. 
West’s voice laughed. “Let’s you 
and me break out of this prison.” 
“Now that you’ve regained 
your self-confidence,” her voice 
teased him. “Don’t get so over- 
confident. I still work here. I 
like it here. You^are my student, 
my job.” 

“To charm us cons away from 
reality?” his voice laughed. 

( CTT/'ould you rather be in one 
’ ’ of those gigantic peni- 
tentiaries in the States — with 
5,000 criminal types, all sup- 
posedly male? March, march! No 
privacy. Fellow prisoners to 
teach you better ways to stick 
up filling stations. Guards who 
shave and aren’t as — ahem — 
sympathetic as I am. Now would 
you trade places?” 

“You do have nice smooth 
skin,” his voice exhaled. “But 
here I’ve never seen another 
prisoner. When I tapped on the 
walls, nobody answered.” 

“Which would you rather 
have? her voice insisted. 

“We’re really all in solitary, 
the 240 men in this tower, and 
in how many other towers.” 
“Ten towers,” she said. “It’s 
not solitary unless you think of 
it as solitary.” 

“2,400 men. How many wom- 
en? Divide by 6?”

“You always try to be too pre- 
cise,” her voice laughed. “Our 
men are changing and graduating 
all the time. The average stay 
is less than a year. Thousands 
and thousands.” Hex; voice grew 
serious. “I think of a stream 
of men being reborn.” 

“I think of thieves and mur- 
derers, criminals, myself, crouch- 
ed in their cells waiting for you.” 
His voice rose. “Listen, I’ll never 
get out of here. For political 
reasons, I’ll never make it.” 

“Oh shut up. Don’t act so 
egotistical. If you want to act 
like a pessimistic, guilt-tortured 
little boy, go ahead and roll in 
your own mess.” In the blanket 
tent rose the bulge of a head. 
“Until you take a more positive 
attitude, you jolly well won’t 
roll on the sheets with me.” 

“You mean it, don’t you?” His 
voice softened, then exclaimed 
with wry laughter, “I understand 
too well! So simple but I don’t 
know how effective. Solitary con- 
finement is the stick, and you’re 
the carrot. I’ve been given don- 
key ears.” 

“You stubborn donk,” her 
voice laughed, “don’t you see any 
further than your big nose? You 
men in here can’t be deeply 
changed by rewards and punish- 
ments. Outside, carrots and sticks 
certainly failed to civilize you 
or you wouldn’t be in here. All 
your life you’ve been rewarded 
76 


and punished but you wouldn’t 
conform and you ended in here.” 
“I need to get out. There is a 
great need for me to get out. 
Outside, the Esks are — ” 

“Sweet, harmless, law-abiding 
people. There’s no use talking 
about Eskimos in here. Listen, 
we want you to like it in here. 
Lover, when you adjust — We 
love you.” 

( t TV /T y God, Nona, are you go- 
'‘-’-‘-ing to give me the Fam- 
ily bit? The Recreation Officer 
already shoveled it on me — 
during his friendly period.” Dr. 
West’s voice rose with anger. 
“The Staff is my family. I am 
provided with a new childhood, 
loving and secure, so that I can 
grow up to the world again. 
Strengthened by my secure sec- 
ond childhood, or is that the 
wrong terminology? With new in- 
ner security we criminals grad- 
uate from our prison families 
into the world to be law-abid- 
ing and patient and sympathetic 
with our fellow man. Bugles, 
please!” 

“It works. The family-group 
produces the — ” 

“Yes, Mom. But Dad was 
nasty today. Was he cranky be- 
cause he thought I wanted to 
get in bed with you?” 

“You don’t need to be that 
sarcastic,” her voice said. 

“I’m sorry. But my eloquence

gets — poisonous. How can you 
bring yourself to lie beside a 
maniac like me? The Civil Ser- 
vice ought to give you a medal. 
If you’re supposed to feel moth- 
erly toward me, you don’t have 
to. Just leave me, please.” 

“I love you.” 

“I should accept that as it is, 
now. You also love five other 
men in five other suites.” 

“Yes, I love men. I love wom- 
en. I love my children. I try 
to love everybody.” 

“Next you’ll tell me you also 
have a husband to love. I was 
hoping — and I wasn’t so jeal- 
ous of my five invisible cell- 
mates,” Dr. West’s voice stam- 
mered, “but I was hoping that 
ring on your third finger left 
hand was just for show.” 

“Every evening after work I 
take the monorail back to the 
apartment district. Did you get 
much of a look at Ottawa?” 

“I saw those angry people wav- 
ing signs at me.” 

“I have three children, three 
little girls. The oldest, she puts 
the T.V. dinners in the oven be- 
fore I get home. After supper I 
help them with their homework. 
On the rug even the second grad- 
er mutters at her homework. The 
older two have begun to giggle 
about boys, and the oldest is 
only in sixth grade, my heavens. 
Then we watch TV, and no one 
wants to go take the first bath. 
THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


When my angels are asleep, I 
think — they’re another day old- 
er and stronger and wiser, I hope. 
I sit watching TV. Me, Pm an- 
other day older. I crawl into 
bed.” 

“I wish I were there with you.” 

“You are. Squeeze me hard. 
You’re in bed _ with me now.” 

ttnphat wasn’t all that I 
meant,” Dr. West’s voice 
replied. “At the moment I feel 
more protective than amorous.” 

“You needn’t be. I can get 
along very well, thank you,” she 
said. “Except when my children 
were helpless babies, I always 
worked, worked as an I.B.M. 
operator, even when my husband 
was working.” Her voice for the 
first time rose in anger. 

Her voice tried again more 
softly. “My husband was a nice 
guy, he really was. I didn’t 
just love him because he was the 
father of my children. He was 
a sweet guy, not scheming, not 
adjustable the way we have to 
be. Everything’s changing faster 
and faster, and he got quieter 
every time they automated away 
his job. What did I do? Did I 
give him inner strength? No. I 
began to earn more money than 
he did. He said less and less. 
When I brought my — our kids 
home from my father’s into the 
kitchen, I ran to turn off the 
gas.”

Her voice sank. “I tried to give 
him artificial respiration. 

“It wasn’t until then, after 
then,” her voice laughed unhap- 
pily, “I learned what brief ani- 
mals we are. You’re all schem- 
ers. If you and I were Outside, 
don’t expect a dinner date down- 
town and a cinerama will make 
me — owe you anything just 
because I haven’t got a husband. 
You understand me?” 

“So you got the perfect job 
here. No, I’m oversimplifying 
you.” 

“Yes, I’m simple. I’m just a 
simple bundle of mother love. 
Always cheery. Pardon me for 
sounding cynical with you, but 
my other students happen to be 
such uneducated children. They 
wouldn’t understand.” 

“Or notice you’re not perfect, 
I hope,” Dr. West laughed. “I 
hope not. You’re our only hope. 
Don’t hurt us. You are too pow- 
erful. Without your personal love 
this would be solitary confine- 
ment, and we convicts would go 
insane. Right now you are mirac- 
ulously changing me and five 
other men.” 

D r. West’s voice suddenly 
probed. “If any of your pris- 
oners fail, I mean, are released 
and then hold up a liquor store, 
do you have such a masochis- 
tic and guilty view of yourself 
that you believe you are respon- 
78 


sible for the failure of this man?” 
“I don’t understand you.” 

“As with the failure of your 
husband.” 

“What are you saying?” 
“Nona, do you think you are 
so godawful powerful that if we 
cons fail it is because of some- 
thing you did or didn’t do?” 

“I don’t understand. Not one 
of my students has become a re- 
cidivist. I’ve worked here four 
years. Twenty-two of my stud- 
ents have graduated. None have 
had any trouble with the law.” 
“You misunderstood my ques- 
tion.” 

“Of course, I’m holding my 
breath about a few of my boys,” 
she said. “They all get pretty fair 
jobs because we’ve retrained 
them, and the government subsi- 
dizes, pays their employers dur- 
ing the first year.” 

“So they get along without 
you?” Dr. West’s voice laughed 
suddenly. “Marry girls just like 
you?” 

“You are a flatterer. My stu- 
dents write to me, some of them, 
and I save the letters and pho- 
tos. One boy is going with a 
woman a little bit older than he 
is, but very pretty. I shouldn’t 
have said that. What I meant to 
say was she looks enough like 
me to be my sister.” 

“No doubt the government 
wishes you could be divided more 
than six ways.”

“Silly. The whole purpose of 
the government’s reformation pol- 
icy is to help them — you — stand 
on their own feet when they go 
Outside. Someday, you’ll — now 
you stop that,” her voice sighed 
languidly. 

“Nona, you’re so warm, so 
smooth — ” 

“I think you just want me to 
stop preaching at you.” 

“Nona, what I want — ” 

“Lover, turn your wrist the 
other way. My heavens! If your 
wristwatch is correct, and I’m 
sure it is, your borrowed time is 
up.” 

“You aren’t going to leave me 
like this?” 

“Sort of let me up, lover. 
Where’s my bra? You’re lying 
on it.” 

“But I was just beginning.” 

“But you’ve no more time to- 
day,” she laughed. “Be here to- 
morrow? On second thought, I 
won’t be back till Wednesday. 
You traded away tomorrow. Oh, 
there’s a run in my stocking. Now 
stop that! You can wait till Wed- 
nesday, lover.” 

The blanket tent shook, and 
Nona’s legs swung out. She fum- 
bled for her shoes. “Where’s my 
comb?” Zipping up the hip of 
her blue skirt, she clicked on 
high heels to the door. There 
was a departing hiss as the inner 
door opened and closed. Dr. 
West was alone. 

THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


D r. West emerged from the 
blanket tent. He stared 
blankly at the huge cage where 
the Arctic ground squirrels slept 
in artificially induced hiberna- 
tion. Then he smiled and squint- 
ed up at the artificial afternoon 
in his suite. 

The luminous ceiling panels 
were synchronized to a clock 
and rheostate. There also was an 
OFF switch, but if he left the 
panels alone the evening would 
come gradually, and then night. 
Then Tuesday. On Wednesday 
morning at 10:00 — 

He smiled down at the coffee 
table where she had sat looking 
up at him. He hurried to dis- 
mantle the tent, folding the 
blankets, his pulse racing, his 
face hot with suppressed mem- 
ory. For an instant he pictured 
her inside the tent, moving. The 
view was too powerful, and he 
laughed and shook his head and 
blinked his eyes. “Wednesday, 
Wednesday, hurry up, Wednes- 
day.” 

He vaulted over the couch, 
grinning. Tomorrow was only 
Tuesday but — “When Tues- 
day’s here, can Wednesday be 
far behind?” 

He reached for a glass tube 
on his work counter and grinned 
at the bunsen burner in his lab 
set up. He felt young. If he soft- 

79 


ened the glass tubing, bending, 
twisting the glass, he could make 
something for her. “A glass gir- 
affe to make her laugh?” 

Behind him, the inner door 
hissed open. With a surge of 
warmth, wanting to believe she 
had returned already, Dr. West 
whirled. 

“Surprise,” the Recreation Of- 
ficer said. “I’m off-duty now — 
doctor. Before you get too well 
adjusted in here I’m to deliver 
this.” 

Beneath his toothbrush mus- 
tache, the Recreation Officer 
forced a smile as he flapped down 
a manila folder on the coffee 
table. “You wanted news of the 
world, didn’t you?” 

Cf ^'et out.” Dr West stared at 
* the folder with its project- 
ing newspaper clippings as if 
he was looking at a snake. Ob- 
viously it did not come from the 
Staff. It was from Outside. 

“I’m sorry,” the Recreation 
Officer’s voice said. “I apologize 
for my eccentric performance this 
morning. Nothing personal, real- 
ly.” 

“Get out, and take it with 
you.” Dr. West felt no desire 
to open the folder. 

“I’m not trying to frame you, 
Doctor. I’m the one who should 
be disciplined — for bringing 
these clipping into your suite.” 

“You tried to trigger me to 


violence during your so-called 
search. You tried to wash me out. 
I assume you’re trying again. 
Get out!” 

“It’s a pity no one will leave 
you alone,” the Recreation Offi- 
cer remarked. “Look, we can be 
frank. I’ve done two things at 
great personal risk. One, dur- 
ing my search their morning I dis- 
connected the audio bug to your 
suite. Two, this noon in the base- 
ment I damn near electrocuted 
myself. Your Ceiling Lens no 
longer is transmitting. Instead, 
I’ve spliced a projector to your 
transmission line in the basement. 
If the observer should happen 
to inspect your telly screen, he’ll 
see what you were doing two days 
ago. Your screen is showing a re- 
play of your old micro-video tape, 
48 hours long. I hope you weren’t 
doing anything suspicious during 
the last 48 hours since I started 
my video tape recorder. I hadn’t 
time to review 48 hours of tape.” 

The Recreation Officer pointed 
at the manila folder. “In any 
case, now you don’t need to try 
to earn brownie points in here by 
claiming you don’t want to break 
the rules. No one is watching you. 
Sit down and read a year’s clip- 
pings. What has really hap- 
pened during this year you’ve 
been isolated in a series of jails? 
Weren’t you the doctor who was 
so concerned about the Esks in- 
creasing?”

GALAXY 


“Right now, I don’t give a 
damn what’s happening Outside. 
Get out.” 

"She’s all heart, Nona really 
is,” the Recreation Officer said 
slyly. “She’s the best woman in 
Tower #3. I don’t blame you for 
forgetting your purpose in life.” 
“What are you trying to do? 
Goad me to break out of here?” 
“I don’t know. I’m not paid 
to think. I’m sure this tower is 
escape-proof. You should be in- 
telligent enough to get yourself 
moved.” The Recreation Officer 
began spreading clippings from 
the New York Times, MacLean’s 
Magazine, Life, Time, American 
Medical Journal, Arctic Review, 
completely covering the coffee 
table. “I’m supposed to say to 
you: hospital or the Cold Room. 
You’re the one with brains!” 

nphe Recreation Director spread 
more clippings on the work 
counter and more clippings on 
top of the insulated cage. “I 
didn’t realize so much had been 
written in the last year about 
the Esks,” the Recreation Offi- 
cer’s voice went on. “I suppose 
all of these are from a clipping 
service. Here’s a tear sheet from 
the Bulletin of Population Scien- 
tists. Someone let slip — you 
used to be editor.” 

“Get out!” 

“They didn’t tell me exactly 
why you were discharged from 
THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


your position at the University 
of California or why you re- 
turned to the Arctic. But I’m 
beginning to understand why you 
tried to infect the Esks. The 
newspaper accounts at the time 
of your trial simplified you for 
the simple minds of their simple 
readers as simply a murderous 
maniac. But no\V the New York 
Times seems to be having second 
thoughts on the matter.” 

“Get out!” Dr. West’s voice 
rose with alarm as the Recrea- 
tion Officer actually did walk 
out of the suite, leaving Dr. West 
alone with hundreds of clippings 
and articles staring whitely at 
him from the terrifying world 
Outside. 

Dr. West chewed his cheek in 
self -torment. Until today with 
Nona he had been preparing for 
the future with almost suicidal 
calm. Now he didn’t want to 
take any risks. All he wanted was 
Wednesday, when Nona would 
return. 

Swaying, Dr. West imagined 
himself gathering up the clip- 
pings, eyes averted. Without 
reading, he would soak the clip- 
pings in the bath-tub, tearing 
and squeezing the paper into 
dying lumps. He would not read 
what other men were thinking 
about the Esks, the research that 
must be going on, perhaps the 
frightened admissions in scien- 
tific circles that he might be 

81 


right, that the terrible thing he 
had attempted was justified. “I 
won’t read! I’m a prisoner and 
safe. Tear them up and flush 
them down the toilet without 
reading — ” 

“That heartless son-of- . 
Dr. West was under such stress 
he was speaking out loud. “Mys- 
terious, lousy wretches who’re 
paying him. I won’t read. What 
do you want me to do? I can’t 
hoist the world on my shoulders. 
I already dropped it. Very fun- 
ny.” Dr. West stared down at 
the clippings on the coffee table. 

His flashing arm swept clip- 
pings fluttering onto the floor. 
“I refuse to destroy myself. I 
will not read.” 

Dr. West dropped to his knees 
and hands on the floor, his head 
throbbing as he read of the mul- 
tiplying Esks. 

An agnostic, he began to pray 
for guidance. 

VIII 

VTo one entered Dr. West’s 
suite the next day, which 
was Tuesday. Not by happen- 
stance, the Recreation Officer had 
telephoned to the Tower from 
outside saying he had the flu 
and would not be reporting for 
duty for a day or two. 

Nona did not enter Dr. West’s 
suite because of the exchange of 
his Tuesday hour to her 11:00- 

82 



till-12 :00 man. She paused out- 
side Dr. West’s suite and did not 
enter and went on to the ad- 
joining cell. 

In the basement the Observ- 
er, monitoring the red-tagged 
screens, yawned and glanced at 
a hockey magazine. 

At 5:00 p.m. when Nona went 
off-duty she hurried to the mon- 
orail because the hair-dresser’s 
would close at 6:00. In the high- 
speed car suspended above the 
city, as Nona found a seat she 
recognized the Man, the back of 
his head, the Man. 

A week before, this short-hair- 
cut Man had sat down beside 
her. At first she hadn’t realized 
his conversation about Ottawa

Reformation Center was more 
than casual. Then she had be- 
come quite abrupt, because her 
first loyalty, her life was tied 
up in the Reformation Center, 
and she was afraid the Man 
might be someone preparing to 
bribe her. She had left the car 
so she would pot have to hear 
where his conversation was lead- 
ing. 

Now, the same Man, short- 
haircut, was sitting in front of 
her. When she got off and rode 
the escalator down to ground 
level, she hoped he wasn’t fol- 
lowing.

THE MODERN PENITENTIARY

while the Tuesday TV news 
blared half-heard everyday top- 
ics: the Maoists, unemployment, 
the Third Mars Expedition, hoc- 
key fights, the underprivileged 
Esks who were being resettled 
in Tibet. 

“Mommy, your new hair-do 
is so pretty.” 

At this, Nona laughed with 
pleasure. “Now go to bed.” And 
soon she slept herself. 

Wednesday morning at 10:00, 
Nona entered Dr. West’s suite 
with her hair up and gleaming 
and her heart beating unexpect- 
edly. She stopped. 

Stripped to the waist, Dr. West 
was lying on his back on top of 
his bed, his jaw sagging like a 
dead man’s, his eyes closed as if 
he were sleeping. 

“My God, he isn’t breathing! 
His heart — ?” 

Ohe rushed to telephone the 
^ Medical Officer. She ran 
back. Her frantic hands shook 
Dr. West’s body. The push of her 
hand against his terribly cool 
chest stimulated a shallow gasp- 
ing breath, then nothing. 

“Please, please.” She flung her- 
self upon him, mouth to mouth, 
trying to breathe for him, end- 
lessly. 

With exhaustion, her own heart 
was fluttering. Her fingernails 
were fastened to his cold flesh. 

“Keep going,” hissed the 


Medical Officer’s voice. “First 
I’m going to give him a shot 
of adrenalin.” After awhile the 
Medical Officer said: “Get off. 
I’m going to attempt external 
heart massage.” 

A half hour later, sweating, the 
Medical Officer stood back. 
“This is the man who feigned 
appendicitis.” He stared at the 
thermometer. “72.6 degrees, and 
only one or two shallow breaths 
per minute. If the room tempera- 
ture sank to 60 degrees, I sup- 
pose his body temperature would 
follow it down. The crazy fool in- 
duced this somehow. For a reas- 
on.” 

“Do something for him!” Nona 
protested. “I’m going to tele- 
phone the hospital.” 

“No, first telephone the Tower 
Administratrix. She’s in com- 
mand here.” For the first time, 
the Medical Officer looked 
around the suite and noticed 
the shambles. “Bloody butcher 
shop!” 

On the work counter lay the 
opened squirrels. Beside them 
stood centrifuge and red-brown, 
stained glass tubing. “He was a 
murderous maniac,” the Medical 
Officer’s voice croaked. 

“No, he wasn’t. They were hi- 
bernating. They didn’t feel any- 
thing,” Nona gasped. “I don’t 
believe he cut them open. I mean, 
he cut them open with a pur- 
pose.” 


84

“He bloody well did,” the Med- 
ical Officer muttered, stooping to 
pick up a hypodermic needle 
from the floor. “No plunger. 
Used rubber bulb from this nose 
drops bottle. This is the needle 
from that missing hypo. May 
have injected a sedative to start 
the downward metabolic slide.” 
The Medical Officer’s fingers 
turned the rubber bulb inside- 
out. “A goo, an extract. Of course 
he would have been aware that 
massive injection of any foreign 
concentration from glandular 
protein, such as a hibernating 
squirrel’s, will produce a lethal 
fever reaction. Foreign protein 
in a human being should be 
fever. Quite odd. No fever, just 
the opposite.” 

“Do something!” Nona’s voice 
protested. “For all you know, he 
may die any minute.” 

“This involves legal as well as 
medical decisions.” The Medical 
Officer appeared relieved when 
the Tower Administratrix arrived. 

r | 'he Medical Officer laughed 
nervously. “Quite diaboli- 
cally, this man has trapped us 
between killing him or doing 
something he wishes.” He tried 
to explain. “Human life is sac- 
red, we say, so we have to save 
him.” 

“We have no right to increase 
his chances of escape. It would 
be unwise to take him to the hos- 
THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


pital building,” the Administra- 
trix replied. “I was so long in 
arriving here because I receiv- 
ed a telephone call from the 
police at the border of the States. 
They searched the luggage of 
what turned out to be our Rec- 
reation Officer from this Tower 

— with his mustache shaved off. 
They found, $1-6,000.00 in small 
bills.” 

“I believe the medical prob- 
lem the former Dr. West has 
prepared for us is this” the Med- 
ical Officer muttered. “If we 
leave him as he is, he will die. 
Alternately, if we attempt to 
bring him out of his hypotherma! 
coma he will die.” 

“My God,” Nona breathed. 
“You already shot him with 
adrenalin to bring him out of 
it.” 

“A natural mistake. I’m hop- 
ing — it already appears that he 
has not reacted to it — I hope. 
Perhaps he has buffered his sys- 
tem against such an eventuality 

— I hope. As I was saying, if 
we try to bring him out of it, 
his metabolic activity will in- 
crease. His system will begin to 
react in a typical defensive man- 
ner to the foreign protein, and 
his temperature will rise. This 
will increase the violence of his 
reaction to the protein, further 
raising his temperature. A self- 
destroying reaction. Violently, 
his body will attempt to defend 

85 


itself against the foreign pro- 
tein, raising his temperature high- 
er and higher until he dies.” 

“No doubt he planned this 
in order to be taken to the hos- 
pital building.” The Tower Ad- 
ministratrix asked, “Could we 
simply leave him here? Assign 
a nurse.” 

The Medical Officer smiled at 
this. “Much more than a nurse 
is needed if we really believe in 
saving human life regardless of 
cost. His life processes should 
be monitored. I suspect his body 
now is in a delicate equilibrium. 
His metabolism is too sluggish to 
react to the foreign protein. No 
reaction, no disease. What is 
needed is speedy consultation 
with experts in human hiberna- 
tion research, who may know 
how, who may have the equip- 
ment to bring him out of this 
condition alive. In the States, 
hibernation research is being con- 
ducted in connection with the 
Space Program, I believe at the 
University of California.” 

(, C Q (.range coincidence,” the 
Tower Administratrix said. 
“Not a coincidence. According to 
his files this man formerly was 
director of a medical research 
program at the University of 
California. Population control. 
Do you think, interlocking medi- 
cal staffs with their hibernation 
space transit program? . An 

86 


attorney in California may be 
waiting to file habeas corpus, 
legal trickery, bail.” 

“I wasn’t suggesting that,” the 
Medical Officer said. “I simply 
was suggesting we make a reason- 
ably humane effort to keep this 
man alive. Surely he can be ade- 
quately guarded in our own hos- 
pital building. I want to tele- 
phone the University of Cali- 
fornia. Perhaps a complete 
change of blood — ” 

The Tower Adiminstratrix 
shook her head. “Look for a 
note,” she said sharply to Nona. 
“Suicide. A note.” 

On the coffee table lay a ma- 
nila folder. Nona opened it. 
Empty. Swiftly she looked 
around the suite. 

Something white showed un- 
der the huge insulated cage and 
Nona knelt down, reaching un- 
der. A newspaper clipping had 
fallen behind the cage, and her 
cold hand drew it out. FUR- 
THER ESKIMO INCREASE 
NOTED. 

“You didn’t smuggle this in, 
did you?” the Administratrix 
asked Nona. “The Recreation Of- 
ficer!” The Administratrix turn- 
ed toward the Medical Officer. 
“If people outside could bribe 
the Recreation Officer so easily, 
how much easier to bribe un- 
derpaid orderlies in the hospi- 
tal! You yourself determined that 
this student’s so-called appendi- 

GALAXY 


citis attack was feigned in order 
to get him out of my Tower and 
into the hospital.” 

The Medical Officer shrugged. 
“He’ll die here.” 

Nona’s hand clamped on the 
Administratrix’s arm. “You’re not 
going to let him die.” 

“Is that a question? I’m sure 
it’s not intended as an order,” the 
Administratrix replied. “Nona, 
this is my responsibility. I know 
you. I know you’re thinking, 
somehow you failed him. You 
didn’t. This man’s urge to es- 
cape was too strong. He has tak- 
en too big a gamble. He can’t 
escape.” 

“You can’t let him die,” Nona 
repeated. 

IX 

tcnphe best guarded building 
-®- outside of the Tower,” 
the Administratrix murmured, “is 
the Cold Room. There, no deci- 
sion would be irrevocable. It 
starts a new problem but — ” 
“That would be the place for 
him, the safest place.” The Med- 
ical Officer stared down at Dr. 
West. “He ignored my warning 
when I sent him back his ap- 
pendix in a bottle. Such power- 
ful motivation is driving him. 
Alive, conscious, he would try 
again to escape. I think we are 
agreed this strident has shown 
himself not amenable to thera- 
THE MODERN PENITENTIARY 


peutic reformation. The Cold 
Room — ” 

“But he’s not an incorrigible,” 
Nona protested. “He hasn’t at- 
tacked the staff.” She turned 
from the Administratrix to con- 
front the Medical Officer. “You 
both want to evade — ” 

“I’m wholly in agreement with 
the A.dministratrix,” the Medical 
Officer continued. “The man has 
shown himself to be dangerous, 
suicidal. No regard for his own 
life. How much regard would 
you expect him to show for 
yours?” 

“I believe he is essentially a 
good man. Better than you!” 
Nona retorted, but they weren’t 
listening. 

“To preserve his life in the 
Cold Room,” the Administratrix 
addressed the Medical Officer, 
“I assume he should be cryo- 
filed as quickly as possible. The 
legal steps can be justified post- 
facto.” 

“Yes, before irreversible physi- 
cal deterioration takes place,” 
the Medical Officer apologized in 
Nona’s direction. “In five or ten 
years when we learn how to 
thaw them out — ” 

“You can’t do this without a 
court hearing,” Nona cried. “The 
two of you standing there can’t 
convict, sentence and execute 
him.” 

“Execute is an unfair word.” 
Instead of growing angry, the 

87 


Administratrix put her arm 
around Nona. “It’s noft your 
fault. I’m sorry you’re emotion- 
tionally involved with this man, 
hut then you’re emotionally in- 
volved with so many of them. 
That’s why you are so good.” 

“Please!” Nona stepped back. 

“Nona, there’s nothing you can 
do,” the Medical Officer said. 
“Nona, you still have five. Do 
your best for them.” 

“You damn weak bootlicker!” 
Nona cried at him. “Would you 
tell that to a mother whose baby 
has died? Would you say, so 
what, you still have five?” 

“If you need to shout, Nona, 
do so at me,” the Administratrix 
said, lowering her head. “For- 
get that I am your superior. If 
you want to accuse me, do so. It 
is I who must bear the respon- 
sibility. 

“You did your best for him. 
You only had him — was it two 
weeks?” The Administratrix’s 
hand closed around Nona’s wrist. 
"Now go home, take the rest of 
the day off, tomorrow off, all 
week off. You are our best. All 
I can hire is an untrained sub- 
stitute to take care of your stu- 
dents until you return. But don’t 
feel guilty about your absence.” 

Without looking at Dr. West’s 
body, Nona walked out of the 
suite. She went to her 11-00-to- 
12:00 man as if nothing had 
happened. The day, the night — 
88 


r T'%at night on TV a politician 
stated that the anticipated 
increase of Eskimos would be a 
blessing. They could be trained 
as government nurses and guards. 
Eskimos needed less pay from 
the taxpayers. Increase would be 
good for Canada, which still had 
plenty of room. Nona could not 
sleep remembering Dr. West. 

In the morning when she en - 
tered the Tower, Nona went to 
the office of the Administratrix. 

“Nona, you’re looking unwell.” 
The Administratrix stood up be- 
hind her desk. 

“I couldn’t sleep, thinking he 
may have tricked us.” Nona said 
slowly, “How do you know the 
body in the drawer in the Cold 
Room is his? Perhaps his real 
plan was a switch of bodies.” 

“Well, surely — ” the Admin- 
istratrix blurted. 

“The Cold Room is guarded,” 
Nona pressed on, “the drawers 
are locked. But last night who 
worked in the cryogenic prepara- 
tion room? Who prepared the 
body?” 

“I don’t know. One of the or- 
derlies!” The Administratrix 
grabbed the phone. 

“I want to go with you to iden- 
tify the body,” Nona said. 

The Cold Room consisted of 
tiers of numbered drawers. As 
the Guard unlocked the drawer, 
Nona memorized the number. 
When she looked down at Dr. 

GALAXY 


West’s wax-pale face, Nona shiv- 
ered .“Yes, that is the man.” 
Now she could tell exactly 
where he was. 

'Tphat night in the mono-rail 
car, to her alarm the Man 
with the short haircut was not 
there. The night before, still 
numb from the terrible scene be- 
side Dr. West’s body, she had 
sat down beside the short-hair- 
cut Man — deliberately. He had 
seemed perceptibly disturbed, 
trapped, hiding behind his news- 
paper while she told him she 
didn’t want money, she wanted 
Dr. West to be removed from the 
Cold Room. “There are thous- 
ands of drawers in there,” he 
had murmured. “Find out the 
drawer number.” And he had 
left the car at the next stop. 

Tonight he was not in the 
mono-rail car, nor waiting at her 
stop. As she walked past the 
magazine rack and the soda 
fountain, a dark young man tried 
to pick her up. She kept walk- 
ing. “What is the number?” he 
was murmuring. 

She paused in the crowd by 
the bus stand. “I won’t tell you 
the number of his cryo-drawer 
until you show proof,” she said 
slowly, “that there is someone 
qualified to bring him out of the 
Cold Room and then out of his 
— hibernation.” 

The dark young man seemed 


startled. “I’ll find out,” he said 
and walked away. 

Nona watched him thread his 
way through the crowd into the 
icy night. Her face felt old with 
determination. Dr. West or who- 
ever he was — the man who built 
the tent with chair and blanket 
— he was hers, still in her care. 

Her jaw hardened. Her teeth 
felt as if they were about to 
crack. It was' even possible that 
these two men, short haircut and 
dark young man, were maneuver- 
ing to kill Dr. West. They might 
be some of those emotional Ca- 
nadians who waved SAVE OUR 
ESKIMOS signs and wanted to 
lynch Dr. West. Or might be 
rescuers. She knew she must deal 
with them with great caution. 

As Nona stepped out into the 
razor-sharp Canadian night, the 
stars were glittering like ice. She 
tipped her head high. Invisible 
up there she knew U.S. astro- 
nauts were supposed to be coast- 
ing on the long voyage to Mars, 
in their hibernation capsules. 

“It truly is possible to rescue 
a man from hibernation.” In the 
cold she hugged her body feeling 
hope as when she had carried 
each of her unborn children. 

Breathing hard, Nona stared 
in the direction of the New Otta- 
wa Reformation Center. 

“You’ll get out,” she whisper- 
ed. I’ll get you out.”

BAtlS 



BY WILLY LEY 

THE SOUND 
OF THE METEORS 

rvn April 25, 1966, a very 
bright meteor flashed across 
the sky over the northeastern 
states. I am sorry to say that 
I missed seeing it. But several 
professional astronomers did see 
it and they estimated the alti- 
tude as about 35 miles. One 
newspaper reporter who saw it 


90 



too wrote a fine report in which 
he remarked that what im- 
pressed him most about the 
fiery display was its complete 
silence. 

Since the altitude was over 30 
miles it would have been mirac- 
ulous if there had been any 
sound. But while this particular 
case is simple and clear-cut 
there have been many occasions 
where chance observers of large 
meteors did report sounds, fol- 
lowing immediately or very soon 
after the flash in the sky. In 
some cases the sound was com- 
pared to a pistol shot, in others 
to a volley or rifle shots; one ob- 
server said that his particular 
meteor made a sound like that 
produced by tearing stiff paper. 
Most observers compared it to 
plain thunder. 

Did they report correctly, or 
did they ascribe chance sounds 
produced by something else at 
what they considered to be the 
right time to the meteor that 
was actually soundless? 

I once worked with a man 
whose favorite conclusion was: 
“at this point we need a mathe- 
matical analysis.” It became a 
catch phrase around the labora- 
tory for two reasons. One, it did 
not matter too much what was 
under discussion to make him 
ask for a mathematical analysis 
and, two, he never made that 
analysis himself but assigned it 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


to whoever was within reach and 
not obviously busy with some- 
thing else. But at this point I 
have to call for a mathematical 
analysis myself . but I can 
assure the reader that it will be 
simple. 

Meteors heat up when they 
enter the earth’s atmosphere be- 
cause they moy'e so fast that 
the air in their flight path can- 
not get out of the way and is 
compressed, just as if that air 
were enclosed in a cylinder and 
the moving meteorite were the 
piston. Of course, some of the 
heat generated by this com- 
pression is transferred to the 
meteorite, and at an altitude of 
77 - 80 miles it has become hot 
enough to glow and to be vis- 
ible. The altitude at which the 
glow becomes visible is almost 
unaffected by the size of the 
body. Only a rather massive 
meteorite, weighing twenty 
pounds or more, may penetrate 
to an altitude of, say, 60 miles 
before becoming visible. Having 
a larger mass it needs more 
time to be heated up to the 
necessary temperature. 

The typical shooting stars, 
cosmic dust grains, become vis- 
ible when they are 80 miles up 
and usually disappear at an al- 
titude of about 55 miles. By then 
they have been consumed com- 
pletely. The larger ones — with 
an original weight of an ounce 


91 



latitudes. 


or so — will penetrate to about 
40 or even 30 miles above the 
ground before they are con- 
sumed. The large ones with an 
original weight of a pound or 
more will actually reach the 
ground. 

T| aving stated the observed 
^ facts about meteors, the 
next step is to have a look at 
the speed of sound. 

Regardless of what many peo- 
ple think — and even regard- 
less of what they may have 
been taught by teachers who 
were not up to date — the speed 
of sound in air does not depend 


on the density of the air but 
only on its temperature. In 
warm air sound travels faster. 
The difference between sea level 
air and stratospheric air 
amounts to almost precisely 
100 miles per hour. It is because 
sea level air is denser than 
stratospheric air that the mis- 
take was made of considering 
the density a factor. Since it 
is the temperature that actual- 
ly counts, the average speed' of 
sound, for middle latitudes, is 
higher in summer than in win- 
ter. (See diagram, Fig. 1.) But 
for many practical purposes the 
difference is rather minor. If 


92 


GALAXY 


we produced an explosion at an 
altitude of 20 miles an observer 
at “ground zero”, that is, direct- 
ly below the explosion, would 
hear the sound 104 seconds af- 
ter the explosion in summer, 
and 108 seconds after the ex- 
plosion in winter. In the table 
to follow summer and winter 
conditions have been averaged 
to 106 seconds for ground zero. 
For an explosion at an altitude 
of 10 miles the figures would 
be 51 seconds in summer and 
53 seconds in winter. 

But we are not quite finished 
with the problem of speed of 
sound and density of the at- 
mosphere. When the statement 
was made that the speed of 
sound depended on the tem- 
perature it was, of course, as- 
sumed that the air is dense 
enough to carry sound at all. 
If the density is very low, 
which means that the molecules 
are rather far apart, you no 
longer get any sound waves, 
even with an explosion that 
would be rather noisy in denser 
air. In our atmosphere this is 
the case for any altitude above 


•The density of the Martian atmosphere 
at ground level was found by Mariner 
IV to be only 1 per cent of sea level 
density on earth. The ground level 
density of the Martian atmosphere, 
therefore, corresponds to our atmos- 
phere at an altitude of 19 - 20 miles. 
The Martian atmosphere Is barely cap- 
able of carrying sound, but the noise 
of an explosion at the surface would 
be carried by the ground too.

25 miles. Meteors, then, can 
produce sound effects only be- 
low 25 miles. Of course this cal- 
culation contains a few assumed 
values that might be slightly 
different in reality; some ex- 
perts therefore put the limit at 
22 miles instead of 25.* To be 
safe let us deal with a maximum 
altitude of 20 miles only. 

It is now quite easy to cal- 
culate how much time will go 
by between a noise -producing 
event at a certain altitude and 
the arrival of the sound on the 
ground. The table gives the re- 
sults. In the first column, 
marked 90°, it is assumed that 
the observer is directly below 
the noise source. But in reality 
this would be a rare event. The 
line from the noise source to 
the observer may form an an- 
gle of 45° with the ground; or 
the noise source might be even 
closer to the horizon, say at an 
elevation of only 30°. The table 


93 


also gives the times for these 
two slant ranges. 

As can be seen from the ta- 
ble, the sound produced by a 
meteor at an altitude of 20 
miles and 30° above the horizon 
will need about 3 l /> minutes to 
reach the observer. An explosion 
10 miles above the ground and 
45° above the horizon will be 
heard on the ground after a 
minute and 13 seconds. It is 
therefore very likely that an 
observer, even if he does hear 
the sound produced by a high 
meteor, will not connect the two 
events. Being used to the idea 
that thunder follows lightning 
within a few seconds he will 
connect any chance noise that 
occurs within 4 or 5 seconds 
with the meteor. 

But this does not mean that 
each and every report of noise 
produced by a meteor was the 
result of a mistake in judg- 
ment. There are a few famous 
cases where there can be no 
doubt. 

T^arly in May, 1803, a report 
that numerous stones had 
fallen from the sky reached the 
Academy of Sciences in Paris. 
Up to then the Academy had 
been very skeptical about such 
stories and had tended to de- 
plore them rather than to in- 
vestigate them. But only a few 
years earlier Ernst Friedrich 


Florens Chladni had published a 
report on stones and irons that 
in all probability had fallen 
from the sky that had made an 
impression on a number of 
members of the Academy. So 
it was decided to send a young- 
er member of the Academy, 
Jean Baptiste Biot, to the place 
where the phenomenon had 
been observed. It was the small 
town of L’Aigle in the Departe- 
ment de I’Orne, 80 miles west 
of Paris. 

Biot first established the time. 
It had been 1 P.M. local time 
on the 26th day of April 1803. 
The sky had been clear except 
for one small cloud. Loud 
sounds like explosions had been 
heard for a period of 5 to 6 
minutes; everybody agreed that 
they came from above and 
since this cloud was the only 
cloud in the sky it seemed to 
be the logical source of the 
noise. Immediately afterward 
2000 stones were seen to fall. 
The largest that was found 
weighed 18.7 pounds, but most 
were smaller; the smallest pieces 
collected weighed less than half 
an ounce. Biot noted that stones 
could be found only in an el- 
liptical area one hour’s journey 
in width and about 2J4 hours’ 
journey in length. Biot referred 
to the time it took to walk 
across and along the area; about 
3 by 8 miles.

GALAXY 


Since the cloud produced by 
the explosion, of the meteorite 
cannot have been very large, 
it probably was less than three 
miles from the ground to be 
visible and the noise would 
reach the ground in 12 - 15 
seconds. This time it was near- 
ly vertically overhead. That the 
noise was actually produced by 
the exploding meteorite can- 
not be doubted, the only doubt- 
ful statement is that the ex- 
plosions lasted “from 5 to 6 
minutes”. This seems too long 
by several minutes, but might 
be explained by putting the 
statements of different observ- 
ers at different slant ranges to- 
gether. They each heard the 


same set of explosions but at 
slightly different times. 

Another famous old case is 
the meteorite of Ensis-Heim, in 
Alsace. It was actually seen to 
fall, between 11 A.M. and noon 
on November 19, 1492, and eye- 
witnesses said that there was a 
loud crash of thunder and a 
prolonged noise from afar, a 
description that sounds very 
much like what we now know 
as sonic boom. It made a hole 
five feet in depth, was dug up 
and weighed — 260 pounds — 
and then taken to the village 
church. It so happened that 
King Maximilian I was there 
at the time. He ordered the 
stone to be brought to his cas-

dialect for "heim" (pronounced hyme), both meaning "home".

tie where he knocked off two 
pieces, one to send to Duke 
Sigismund of Austria and one 
for himself. Then he ordered 
the stone to be preserved with- 
out further damage in the 
church. After a long time it was 
moved to the City Hall; at any 
event it was preserved for cen- 
turies. 

At that time there already 
existed a forerunner of the 
newspapers of a later date. Bib- 
liophiles know this forerunner 
under the name of Einblatt- 
dtuck, a German term mean- 
ing one-sheet-print. An Einblatt- 
druck was printed when a spe- 
cial event was to be reported; 
a large percentage of them deal 
with comets and the “meaning” 
of the appearance of one. But 
this event also rated an Ein- 
blattdmck. As customary it 
showed in a woodcut of the 
event (Fig. 2) on top, with a 
description underneath. It would 
be nice to know whether the 
artist who made the woodcut 
had been an eyewitness. If he 
was, the sky must have been 
cloudy that day. 

'T'o round off this short sur- 
^ vey the most recent major 
fall of meteorites must be men- 
tioned. It is known as the Sik- 
hote-Alin meteorite fall after 
the name of the mountain range 
in eastern Siberia where the im- 


pact took place. The date was 
February 12, 1947, and the lo- 
cal time was 10:38 A.M. The 
sky was cloudless. 

Professor E. Krinov of the 
Soviet Academy of Sciences 
described the event as follows: 
“A scintillating ball of fire with 
a luminous tail and sparks sped 
for several seconds across the 
cloudless sky in broad daylight. 
The bolide was so bright that 
it blinded the eyes of people 
watching it and it cast moving 
shadows. In its wake there re- 
mained a wide gray band of 
dust that was seen for several 
hours. Some minutes after the 
fireball disappeared powerful 
detonations were heard, resem- 
bling explosions or the firing of 
heavy guns.” 

The actual impact point was 
quickly spotted from the air 
because the area was still cov- 
ered with snow; the places 
where the fragments of the me- 
teorite had hit looked brownish 
as they do in summer. Expedi- 
tions set out from both Vladi- 
vostok and Khabarocsk for a 
preliminary survey. They found 
over 120 impact craters ranging 
in size from 1J4 feet to 90 feet 
and 78 holes less than 1J4 feet 
in diameter that had been pro- 
duced by the fragments. Frag- 
ments could be found every- 
where. Some fragments had 
struck trees so that the angle 


96 


GALAXY 


of impact could be established 
directly. The gray dust that 
had hovered in the air after the 
passage of the body had set- 
tled in the meantime and was 
partly recovered from the ground 
with the aid of powerful mag- 
nets. It proved to consist of 
round globules of iron that had 
formed in midair. Some of them 
had fused together and most of 
them could be seen only with a 
strong magnifying glass. 

It could be calculated later 
on that the meteorite must have 
entered our atmosphere with a 
relative velocity of 8.7 miles per 
second. The original weight 
must have been on the order 
of 30 tons. The pieces sent to 
Moscow for examination had a 
total weight of 23 (metric) tons. 
The investigation of these pieces 
not only gave the chemical 
composition (93.5 per cent iron; 
5.27 per cent nickel; 0.47 per 
cent cobalt; 0.20 per cent phos- 
phorus and 0.06 per cent sul- 
fur) but it also showed why 
this metorite had broken up as 
thoroughly as it had. It was not 
a homogeneous mass of meteoric 
iron but instead consisted of 
pieces that seem to have been 
fused together by pressure or 
heat some time in the distant 
past. Moreover the iron parts 
were often separated by thin 
layers of a mineral called 
schreibersite which is a com- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


pound of iron and phosphorus. 
These mineral layers provided 
natural lines of cleavage. Pre- 
sumably the meteorite had al- 
ready broken apart during the 
passage through the air. The 
larger fragments that might still 
have weighed a ton, or more 
then broke apart . when they 
struck the rocky ground. 

I have selected these three 
cases of meteoric noise be- 
cause they represent three dif- 
ferent types of noise produc- 
tion. The noise heard over 
L’Aigle was, in all probability, 
produced by the breakup of the 
meteorite after it had traversed 
the upper layers of the atmos- 
phere more or less in one piece. 
It is unfortunate that we know 
nothing of the angle of the 
flightpath in this case; the stones 
that fell from the cloud fell ver- 
tically or very nearly so and 
obviously with subsonic speeds. 

In the case of the older fall 
in Alsace the description sounds 
as if the meteorite reached the 
ground intact, having travelled 
with supersonic speed almost 
until impact. What the people 
heard was the noise of the im- 
pact and then the sonic boom 
produced earlier. 

The Siberian meteorite of 
1947 must have moved with sub- 
sonic speed by the time it be- 
came visible because nothing 

97 


that could be ascribed to a sonic 
boom is mentioned. The sound 
resembling the noise of artil- 
lery fire that was heard was 
caused by the not quite simul- 
taneous impacts of many frag- 
ments. If the sky had been 
cloudy at the time the im- 
pact noises would have pro- 
duced a prolonged thunderous 
roar because of the reflection 
of the sound waves from clouds 
at different heights. 

And now we can sum up the 
whole problem of noises pro- 
duced by meteors. 

If the noise-producing event 
— e. g., the breakup of the 
meteorite — takes place above 22 
(or 25) miles nothing will be 
heard because no sound waves 
can be produced. If a bright 
meteor passes overhead at a 
height of less than 20 miles with 
an impact point a long distance 
away, a kind of faint thunder 
might be heard, but more than 
a minute after the phenomenon 
has been seen. This is the sit- 
uation when mistakes are most 
likely to be made, with random

1947 Meteorite Fall. The distance 
of the impact point from Vladivos- 
tok is about 200 miles. 

noises ascribed to the meteor 
and its real noise being disre- 
garded. 

But an observer situated only 
a few miles from the impact 
point of a large meteorite might 
hear all three kinds of noise: the 
“boom” of the supersonic pas- 
sage through the atmosphere, 
the noise of the breakup if it 
occurs and finally the sound of 
the impact.

At the

What good's a planet? It's nothing 
but the bottom of a gravity hole in 
space — unless it's a hiding place!

'T'welve stories below the roof 
gardens were citrus groves, 
grazing pastures and truck farms. 
They curved out from the base 
of the hotel in neat little squares, 
curved out and up, and up, and 
up and over. Five miles overhead 
was the fusion sunlight tube, run- 


ning down the radius of the 
slightly bulging cylinder that 
was Farmer’s Asteroid. Five 
miles above the sunlight tube, 
the sky was a patchwork of 
small squares, split by a cen- 
tral wedding ring of lake and by 
tributary rivers, alive with the 
tiny red glints of self-guided 
tractors.

Lucas Gamer was half day- 
dreaming, letting his eyes rove 
the solid sky. At the Belt gov- 
ernment’s invitation he had en- 
tered a bubbleworld for the first 
thne, combining a vacation from 
United Nations business with a 
chance at a brand new experi- 
ence — a rare thing for a man 
of seventeen decades old. He 
found it pleasantly kooky to look 
up into a curved sky of fused 
rock and imported topsoil. 

“There’s nothing immoral 
about smuggling,” said Lit 
Shaeffer. 

The surface overhead was dot- 
ted with hotels, as if the bubble- 
world were turning to city. Gar- 
ner knew it wasn’t. Those hotels, 
and the scattered hotels in the 
other bubbleworld, served every 
Belter’s occasional need for an 
Earthlike environment. Belters 
don't need houses. A Belter’s 
home is the inside of his pressure 
suit. 

Gamer returned his attention 
to his host. “You mean smug- 
gling's like picking pockets on 
Earth?'' 

“That's just what I don’t 
mean," Shaeffer said. The Belter 
reached into his coverall pocket, 
pulled out something flat and 
black and laid it on the table. 
“I’ll want to play that in a min- 
ute. Gamer, picking pockets is 
legal on Earth. Has to be, the 
way you crowd together. You 
100 


couldn’t enforce a law against 
picking pockets. In the Belt 
smuggling is against the law, but 
it isn’t immoral. It’s like a flat- 
lander forgetting to feed the 
parking meter. There’s no loss of 
self-respect. If you get caught 
you pay the fine and forget it.” 

“Oh.” 

“If a man wants to send his 
earnings through Ceres, that’s up 
to him. It costs him a straight 
thirty per cent. If he thinks he 
can get past the goldskins, that 
too is his choice. But if we 
catch him we’ll confiscate his 
cargo, and everybody will be 
laughing at him. Nobody pities 
an inept smuggler.” 

“Is that what Muller tried to 
do?” 

“Yah. He had a valuable car- 
go, twenty kilos of pure north 
magnetic poles. The temptation 
was too much for him. He tried 
to get past us, and we picked 
him up on radar. Then he did 
something stupid. He tried to 
whip around a hole. 

“He must have been on course 
for Luna when we found him. 
Ceres was behind him with the 
radar. Our ships were ahead of 
him, matching course at two 
gee. His mining ship wouldn’t 
throw more than point five gee, 
so eventually they’d pull along- 
side him no matter what he 
did. Then he noticed Mars was 
just ahead of him.” 


GALAXY 


“The hole.” Garner knew 
enough Belters to have learned 
a little of their slang. 

“The very one. His first in- 
stinct must have been to change 
course. Belters learn to avoid 
gravity wells. A man can get 
killed half a dozen ways coming 
too close to a hole. A good auto- 
pilot will get him safely around 
if, or program an in-and-out 
spin, or even land him at the 
bottom, God forbid. But miners 
don’t carry good autopilots. 
They carry cheap autopilots, 
and they stay clear of holes.” 

, “You’re leading up to some- 
thing,” Gamer said regretful- 
ly. “Business?” 

“You’re too old to fool.” 

Sometimes Garner believed 
that himself. Sometime between 
the first world war and the 
blowing of the second bubble- 
world, Garner had learned to 
read faces as accurately as men 
read print. Often it saved time 
— and in Gamer’s view his 
time was worth saving. 

“Go on,” he said. 

“Muller’s second thought was 
to use the hole. An in-and-out 
spin would change his course 
more than he could hope to do 
with the motor. He could time 
it so Mars would hide him from 
Ceres when he curved out. He 
could damn near touch the sur- 
face, too. Mars’ atmosphere is 
as thin as a flatlander’s dreams.” 
AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLE 


“Thanks a lot. Lit, isn’t Mars 
U. N. property?” 

“Only because we never want- 
ed it.” 

Then Muller had been tres- 
passing. “Go on. What hap- 
pened to Muller?” 

“I’ll let him tell it This is his 
log.” Lit Shaeffer did something 
to the flat box, and a man’s voice 
spoke. - ' 


II 


A pril 20, 2112. 

The sky it flat, the land is 
flat, and they meet in a circle at 
infinity. No star shows but the 
big one, a little bigger than it 
shows through most of the Belt, 
but dimmed to red, like the sky. 

It’s the bottom of a hole. 

I must have been crazy to 
risk it. But I’m here. I got 
down alive. I didn’t expect to, 
not there at the end. 

It was one crazy landing. 

Imagine a universe half of 
which has been replaced by an 
ochre abstraction, too distant 
and far too big to show mean- 
ingful detail, moving past you 
at a hell of a clip. A strange, 
singing sound comes through 
the walls, like nothing you’ve 
ever heard before, like the sound 
of the wings of the angel of 
death. The walls are getting 
warm. You can hear the ther- 
mosystem whining even above 

101 


the shriek of air whipping 
around the hull. Then, because 
you don’t have enough prob- 
lems, the ship shakes itself like 
a mortally wounded dinosaur. 

That was my fuel tanks tear- 
ing loose. All at once and noth- 
ing first, the four of them sheer- 
ed their mooring bars and went 
spinning down ahead of me, 
cherry red. 

That faced me with two bad 
choices. I had to decide fast. 
If I finished the hyperbola, I’d 
be heading into space on an 
unknown course with what fuel 
was left in my inboard cooling 
tank. My lifesystem wouldn’t 
keep me alive more than two 
weeks. There wasn’t much chance 
I could get anywhere in that 
time, with so little fuel, and 
I’d seen to it the goldskins 
couldn’t come to me. 

But the fuel in the cooling 
tank would get me down. Even 
the ships of Earth use only a 
little of their fuel in getting 
in and out of their pet gravity 
well. Most of it gets burned 
getting them from place to place 
fast. And Mars is lighter than 
Earth. 

But what then? I’d still have 
two weeks to live. 

I remember the old Lacus 
Solis base, deserted seventy 
years ago. Surely I could get 
lifesystems working well enough 
to support one man. I might 
102 


even find enough water to turn 
some into hydrogen by electroly- 
sis. It was a better risk than 
heading out into nowhere. 

Right or wrong, I went 
down. 

The stars are gone, and the 
land around me makes no sense. 
Now I know why they call 
planet-dwellers “flatlanders”. I 
feel like a gnat on a table. 

I’m sitting here shaking, 
afraid to step outside. 

Beneath a red-black sky is a 
sea of dust, punctuated by scat- 
tered, badly cast glass ash trays. 
The smallest, just outside the 
port, are a few inches in dia- 
meter. The largest are miles 
across. As I came down the deep 
radar showed me fragments of 
much larger craters under the 
dust. The dust is soft and fine, 
almost like quicksand. I came 
down like a feather, but the 
ship is buried to halfway up the 
lifesystem. 

I set down just beyond the 
lip of one of the largest craters, 
the one which houses the ancient 
flatlander base. From above, the 
base looked like a huge, trans- 
parent raincoat discarded on the 
cracked bottom. 

It’s a weird place. But I’ll 
have to go out sometime; how 
else can I use the base lifesys- 
tem? 

As Uncle Bat told me, stupid- 
ity carries the death penalty. 

GALAXY 


I’ll try to go outside tomorrow. 
A pril 21, 2112. 

-t*- My clock says it’s morning. 
The sun’s around on the other 
side of the planet, leaving the 
sky no longer bloody. It looks 
almost like space if you remem- 
ber to look away from gravity, 
though the stars are dim, as if 
seen through fogged plastic. A 
big star has come over the hori- 
zon, brightening and dimming 
like a spinning rock. Must be 
Phobos, since it came from the 
sunset region . 

I’m going out. 

Later: 

A sort of concave glass shell 
surrounds the ship where the 
fusion flame splashed down. The 
ship’s lifesystem, the half that 
shows above the dust, rests in 
the center like a frog on a lily- 
pad in Confinement Asteroid. The 
splash-down shell is all a spider 
web of cracks, but it’s firm 
enough to walk on. 

Not so the dust. 

The dust is like thick oil. The 
moment I stepped onto it I 
started to sink. I had to swim 
to where the crater rim slopes out 
like the shore of an island. It 
was hard work. Fortunately the 
splash-down shell reaches to the 
crater rock at one point, so I 
won’t have to do that again. 

It’s queer, this dust. I doubt 
you could find its like anywhere 
AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLE 


in the system. It’s meteor de- 
bris, condensed from vaporized 
rock. On Earth, dust this fine 
would be washed down to the 
sea by rain and turned to sedi- 
mentary rock, natural cement. 
On the Moon there would be 
vacuum cementing, the bugaboo 
of the Belt’s microminiaturization 
industries. But. here, there’s just 
enough “air’ r to be absorbed by 
the dust surface ... to prevent 
vacuum cementing . and not 
nearly enough to stop a meteor- 
ite. Result: it won’t cement, no- 
how. So it behaves like a viscous 
fluid. Probably the only rigid 
surfaces are the meteor craters 
and mountain ranges. 

Going up the crater lip was 
rough. It’s all cracked, tilted 
blocks of volcanic glass. The 
edges are almost sharp. This 
crater must be geologically re- 
cent. At the bottom, half sub- 
merged in a shallow lake of dust, 
is bubbletown. I can walk okay 
in this gravity; it’s something 
less than my ship’s gee max. But 
I almost broke by ankles a cou- 
ple of times getting down over 
those tilted, slippery, dust-cov- 
ered blocks. As a whole the crat- 
er is a smashed ash tray pieced 
loosely together like an im- 
promptu jigsaw puzzle. 

The bubble covers the base 
like a deflated tent, with the 
air-making machinery just out- 
side. The airmaker is in a great 

103 


:ube of black metal, blackened 
oy seventy years of Martian at- 
mosphere. It’s huge. It must 
have been a pain to lift. How 
:hey moved that mass from Earth 
to Mars with only chemical and 
ion rockets, I’ll never know. 
Also, why? What was on Mars 
that they wanted? 

If ever there was a useless 
world, this is it. It’s not close 
to Earth, like the Moon. The 
gravity’s inconveniently high. 
There are no natural resources. 
Lose your suit pressure, and it’d 
be a race against time, whether 
you died of blowout or of red, 
fuming nitric acid eating your 
lungs. 

The wells? 

Somewhere on Mars there are 
wells. The first expedition found 
one in the nineteen nineties. A 
mummified something was near- 
by. It exploded when it touched 
water, so nobody ever knew more 
about it, including just how old 
it was. 

Did they expect to find live 
Martians? If so, so what? 

Outside the bubble are two 
two-seater Marsbuggies. They 
have an enormous wheelbase and 
wide, broad wheels, probably 
wide enough to keep the buggy 
above the dust while it’s mov- 
ing. You’d have to be careful 
where you stopped. I won’t be 
using them anyway. 

The airmaker will work, I 
104 


think, if I can connect it to the 
ship’s power system. Its batter- 
ies are drained, and its fusion 
plant must be mainly lead by 
now. Thousands of tons of 
breathing air are all about me, 
tied up in nitric oxide, NO 2 . The 
airmaker will release oxygen and 
nitrogen and will also pick up 
what little water vapor there is. 
I’ll pull hydrogen out of the 
water for fuel. But can I get the 
power? There may be cables in 
the base. 

It’s for sure I can’t call for 
help. My antennae burned off 
coming down. 

I looked through the bubble 
and saw a body, male, a few feet 
away. He’s died of blowout. 
Odds are I’ll find a rip in the 
bubble when I get around to 
looking. 

Wonder what happened here? 

\ pril 22, 2112. 

I went to sleep at first sun- 
light. Mar’s rotation is just a 
fraction longer than a ship’s day, 
which is convenient. I can work 
when the stars show and the 
dust doesn’t, and that’ll keep me 
sane. But I’ve had breakfast and 
done clean-ship chores, and still 
it’ll be two hours before sun- 
down. Am I a coward? I can’t 
go out there in the light. 

Near the sun the sky is like 
fresh blood, tinged by nitric ox- 
ide. On the other side it’s almost 

GALAXY 


black. Not a sign of a star. The 
desert is flat, broken only by 
craters and by a regular pattern 
of crescent dunes so shallow that 
they can be seen only near the 
horizon. Something like a straight 
lunar mountain range angles 
away into the desert; but it’s 
terribly eroded, like something 
that died a long time ago. Could 
it be the tilted lip of an ancient 
asteroid crater? The Gods must 
have hated Mars, to put it so 
close to the middle of the Belt. 
This shattered, pulverized land is 
like a symbol of age and cor- 
ruption. Erosion seems to live 
only at the bottom of holes. 

Later: 

Almost dawn. I can see red 
washing out the stars. 

After sundown I entered the 
base through the airlock, which 
still stands. Ten bodies are 
sprawled in what must have been 
the village square. Another was 
halfway into a suit in the ad- 
ministration building, and the 
twelfth was a few feet from the 
bubble wall, where I saw him 
yesterday. A dozen bodies, and 
they all died of blowout. Explo- 
sive decompression if you want 
to be technical. 

The circular area under the 
bubble is only half full of build- 
ings. The rest is a carefully fused 
sand floor. Other buildings lie 
in stacks of walls, ceilings, floors, 
ready to be put up. I suppose 
AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLE 


the base personnel expected 
others from Earth. 

One of the buildings held elec- 
trical wiring. I’ve hooked a ca- 
ble to the airmaker battery and 
was able to adapt the other end 
to the contact on my fusion 
plant. There’s a lot of sparking, 
but the airmakers works. I’m let- 
ting it fill the stack of empty O- 
tanks I found against a pile of 
walls. The nitrogen is draining 
into the bubble. 

I know now what happened to 
the flatlander base. 

Bubbletown died by murder. 
No question of it. When nitrogen 
started pouring into the bubble, 
I saw dust blowing out from the 
edge of town. There was a rip. 
It was sharp edged, as if cut 
by a knife. I can mend it if I 
can find a bubble repair kit. 
There must be one somewhere. 

Meanwhile I’m getting oxygen 
and water. The oxygen tanks I 
can empty into the lifesystem as 
they fill. The ship takes it back 
out of the air and stores it. If 
I can find a way to get the water 
here I can just pour it into the 
john. Can I carry it here in the 
O -tanks? 

Ill

Dawn. 

The administration building is 
also a tape library. They kept

a record of the base doings, very 
complete and so far very bor- 
ing. It reads like a ship’s log 
sounds, but more gossipy and 
more detailed. Later I’ll read it 
all the way through. 

I found some bubble plastic 
and contact cement and used 
them to patch the rip. The bub- 
ble still wouldn’t inflate. So I 
went out and found two more 
rips just like the first. I patched 
them and looked for more. Found 
three. When I got them fixed it 
was nearly sunup. 

The O-tanks hold water, but I 
have to heat them to boil the 
water to get it out. That’s hard 
work. Question: is it easier to 
do that or to repair the dome 
and do my electrolysis inside? 
How many rips are there? 

I’ve found six. So how many 
killers were there? No more than 
three. I’ve accounted for twelve 
inside, and according to the log 
there were fifteen in the second 
expedition. 

No sign of the goldskins. If 
they’d guessed I was here they’d 
have come by now. With several 
months’ worth of air in my life- 
system, I’ll be home free once I 
get out of this hole. 

\ pril 24, 2112. 

Two more rips in the bub- 
ble, a total of eight. They’re 
about twenty feet apart, evenly 
spaced around the transparent 
AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLE 


plastic fabric. 'It looks like at 
least one man ran around the 
dome slashing at the fabric un- 
til it wasn’t taut enough to cut. 
I mended the rips. When I left 
the bubble had started swelling 
with air. 

I’m halfway through the town 
log, and nobody’s seen a Martian 
yet. I was right, that’s what they 
came for. Thus .far they’ve found 
three more wells. Like the first, 
these are made of cut diamond 
building blocks, fairly large, 
very well worn, probably tens or 
hundreds of thousands of years 
old. 

Two of the four have dirty 
nitric acid at the bottoms. The 
others are dry. Each of the four 
has a “dedication block” cover- 
ed with a queer, partially erod- 
ed writing. From a partial analy- 
sis of the script, it seems that the 
wells were actually cremator- 
iums; a deceased Martian would 
explode when he touched water 
in the nitric acid at the bot- 
tom. It figures. Martians 
wouldn’t have fire. 

I still wonder why them came, 
the men of the base. What could 
Martians do for them? If they 
wanted someone to talk to, 
someone not human, there were 
dolphins and killer whales right 
in their own oceans. The trou- 
ble they took! And the risks! 
Just to get from one hole to an- 
other!

A pril 24, 2112. 

Strange. For the first time 
since the landing, I did not re- 
turn to the ship when the sky 
turned light. When I did start 
back the sun was up. It showed 
as I went over the rim. I stood 
there between a pair of sharp 
obsidian teeth, staring down at 
my ship. 

It looked like the entrance to 
Confinement Asteroid. 

Confinement is where they 
take women when they get preg- 
nant: a bubble of rock ten miles 
long and five miles across, spin- 
ning on its axis to produce one 
gee of outward pull. The chil- 
dren have to stay there for the 
first year, and the law says they 
have to spend a month out of 
each year there until they’re 
fifteen. I’ve a wife named Letty 
waiting there now, waiting fof 
the year to pass so she can leave 
with our daughter Janice. Most 
miners, they pay the fatherhood 
fee in one lump if they’ve got 
the money; it’s about sixty 
thousand commercials, so some 
have to pay in installments, and 
sometimes it’s the woman who 
pays; but when they pay they 
forget about it and leave the 
women to raise the kids. But I’ve 
been thinking about Letty. And 
Janice. The monopoles in my 
hold would buy gifts for Letty, 
and raise Janice with enough left 
over so she could do some travel- 
108 


mg, and still I’d have enough 
commercials left for more chil- 
dren. I’d have them with Letty, 
if she’d agree. I think she would. 

How’d I get onto that? As I 
was saying before I was so rude- 
ly interrupted, my ship looks 
like the entrance to Confinement 
— or to Farmer’s Asteroid, or 
any underground City. With the 
fuel tanks gone there’s nothing 
left but the drive and the life- 
system and a small magnetical- 
ly insulated cargo hold. Only 
the top half of the lifesystem 
shows above the sea of dust, a 
blunt steel bubble with a thick 
door, not streamlined like a ship 
of Earth. The heavy drive tube 
hangs from the bottom, far be- 
neath the dust. I wonder how 
deep the dust is. 

The splashdown shell will 
leave a rim of congealed glass 
around my lifesystem. I wonder 
if it’ll affect my takeoff? 

Anyway, I’m losing my fear of 
daylight. 

Yesterday I thought the bub- 
ble was inflating. It wasn’t. More 
rips were hidden under the pool 
of dust, and when the pressure 
built up the dust blew away and 
down went the bubble. I repaired 
four rips today before sunlight 
caught me. 

One man couldn’t have made 
all those slashes. 

That fabric’s tough. Would a 
knife go through it? Or would 

GALAXY 


you need something else, like 
an electric knife or a laser? 

A pril 25, 2112. 

-*"*• I spent most of today read- 
ing the bubbletown log. 

There was a murder. Tensions 
among fifteen men with no wom- 
en around can grow pretty fierce. 
One day a man named Carter 
killed a man named Harness, 
then ran for his life in one of 
tire Marsbuggies, chased by the 
victim’s brother. Neither came 
back. They must have run out 
of air. 

Three dead out of fifteen 
leaves twelve. 

Since I counted twelve bodies, 
who’s left to slash the dome? 

Martians? 

In the entire log I find no men- 
tion of a Martian being seen. 
Bubbletown never ran across any 
Martian artifact, except the wells. 
If there are Martians, where are 
they? Where are their cities? 
Mars was subjected to all kinds 
of orbital reconaissance in the 
early days. Even a city as small 
as Bubbletown would have been 
seen. 

Maybe there are no cities. But 
where do the diamond blocks 
come from? Diamonds as big as 
the well material don’t form nat- 
urally. It takes a respectable 
technology to make them that 
big. Which implies cities — I 
think. 

AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLE 


That mummy. Could it have 
been hundreds of thousands of 
years old? A man couldn’t last 
that long on Mars, because the 
water in his body would react 
with the nitric oxide around him. 
On the Moon, he could last mill- 
ions of years. The mummified 
Martian’s body chemistry was 
and is a complete mystery, bar- 
ring the napalmlike explosion 
when water touched it. Perhaps 
it wtas that durable, and perhaps 
one of the pair who left to die 
returned to cut the dome in- 
stead, and perhaps I’m seeing 
goblins. This the place for it. 

If I ever get out of here, you 
try and catch me near another 
hole. 

A pril 26, 2112. 

The sun shows clear and 
bright above a sharp-edged hor- 
izon. I stand at the port looking 
out. Nothing seems strange any 
more. I’ve lived here all my life. 
The gravity is settling in my 
bones; I no longer stumble as I 
go over the crater lip. 

The oxygen in my tanks will 
take me anywhere. Give me hy- 
drogen, and you’ll find me on 
Luna, selling my monopoles 
without benefit of a middleman. 
But it comes slowly. I can get 
hydrogen only by carrying water 
in the base O-tanks and then 
electrolyzing it into the fuel cool- 
ing tank, where it liquefies. 

109 


The desert is empty except for 
a strange, rosy cloud that cov- 
ers one arm of horizon. Dust? 
Probably. I heard the wind sing- 
ing faintly through my helmet 
as I returned to the ship. Nat- 
urally the sound can’t get 
through the hull. 

The desert is empty. 

I can’t repair the bubble. To- 
day I found four more rips be- 
fore giving up. They must circle 
the bubble all the way ’round. 
One man couldn’t have done it. 
Two men couldn’t. 

It looks like Martians. But 
where are they? 

They could walk on the sand, 
if their feet were flat and broad 
and webbed . and there’d be 
no footprints. The dust hides 
everything. If there were cities 
here the dust must have covered 
them ages ago. The mummy 
wouldn’t have shown webbing; it 
would have been worn away. 

Now it’s starlessly black out- 
side. The thin wind must have 
little trouble lifting the dust. I 
doubt it will bury me. Anyway 
the ship would rise to the sur- 
face. 

Gotta sleep. 

A pril 27, 2112. 

It’s oh four hundred by the 
clock, and I haven’t slept at all. 
The sun is directly overhead, 
blinding bright in a clear, red 
sky. No more dust storm, 

no 


The Martians exist. I’m sure 
of it. Nobody else was left to 
murder the base. 

But why don’t they show 
themselves? 

I’m going to the base, and I’m 
taking the log with me. 

IV 

I ’m in the village square. Odd- 
ly enough, it was easier mak- 
ing the trip in sunlight. You can 
see what you’re stepping on, even 
in shadow, because the sky dif- 
fuses the light a little, like in- 
direct lighting in a dome city. 

The crater lip looks down on 
me from all sides, splintered 
shards of volcanic glass. It’s a 
wonder I haven’t cut my suit 
open yet, making that trip twice 
a day. 

Why did I come here? I don’t 
know. My eyes feel rusty, and 
there’s too much light. Mummies 
surround me, with faces twisted 
by anguish and despair and with 
fluids dried on their mouths. 
Blowout is an ugly death. Ten 
mummies here, and one by the 
edge of town, and one in the 
admin building. 

I can see all of the crater lip 
from here. The buildings are 
low bungalows, and the square 
is big. True, the deflated bubble 
distorts things a little, but not 
much. 

So. The Martians came over 
GALAXY 


the lip in a yelling swarm or a 
silent one, brandishing sharp 
things. Nobody would have 
heard them if they yelled. 

But ten men were in a position 
to see them. 

Eleven men. There’s a guy at 
the edge . no, they might have 
come from the other direction. 
But still, ten men. And they just 
waited here? I don’t believe it. 

The twelfth man. He’s half in- 
to a suit. What did he see? 

I’m going to go look at him. 

By God, I was right. He’s got 
two fingers on a zipper, and he’s 
pulling down. He’s not half into 
a suit, he’s half out of it! 

No more goblins. 

But who cut the dome? 

The hell with it. I’m sleepy. 

pril 28, 2112. 

A day and a half of log to 
Catch up on. 

My cooling tank is full, or 
nearly. I’m ready to try the 
might of the goldskins again. 
There’s air enough to let me take 
my time, and less chance of a 
radar spotting me if I move slow- 
ly. Good-by, Mars, lovely para- 
dise for the manic depressive. 

That’s not funny. Consider the 
men in the base. 

Item: it took a lot of knives 
to make those slits. 

Item: everyone was inside. 

Item: no Martians. They 

would have been seen. 


Therefore the slits were made 
from inside. If someone was run- 
ning around making holes in the 
bubble, why didn’t someone stop 
him? 

It looks like mass suicide. 
Facts are facts. They must have 
spread evenly out around the 
dome, slashed, and then walked 
to the town square’ against a driv- 
ing wind of breathing-air roaring 
out behind them. Why? Ask ’em. 
The two who aren’t in the square 
may have been dissenters; if so, 
it didn’t help them. 

Being stuck at the bottom of 
a hole is not good for a man. 
Look at Earth’s insanity records. 

I am now going back to a min- 
ute-to-minute log. 

1120 

Ready to prime drive. The dust 
won’t hurt the fusion tube, noth- 
ing could do that, but backblast 
might damage the rest of the 
ship. Have to risk it. 

1124. 

The first shot of plutonium 
didn’t explode. Priming again. 
1130 

The drive’s dead. I can’t un- 
derstand it. My instruments 
swear the fusion shield is draw- 
ing power, and when I push the 
right button the hot uranium gas 
sprays in there. What’s wrong? 

Maybe a break in the primer 
line. How am I going to find out? 
The primer line’s way down 
there under the dust. 



AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLE 


111 


1245 

I’ve sprayed enough uranium 
into the fusion tube to make a 
pinch bomb. By now the dust 
must be hotter than Washington. 

How am I going to repair that 
primer line? Lift the ship in my 
strong, capable hands? Swim 
down through tire dust and do 
it by touch? I haven’t anything 
that’ll do a welding job under 
ten feet of fine dust. 

I think I’ve had it. 

Maybe there’s a way to signal 
the goldskins. A big, black SOS 
spread on the dust ... if I could 
find something black to spread 
around. Have to search the base 
again. 

1900 

Nothing in the town. Signaling 
devices in plenty, for suits and 
Marsbuggies and orbital ships, 
but only the laser was meant 
to reach into space. I can’t fix 
a seventy-year-old comm laser 
with spit and wire and good in- 
tentions. 

I’m going off minute-to-min- 
ute. There’s be no takeoff. 

A pril 29, 2112. 

^ *■ I’ve been stupid. 

Those ten suicides. What did 
they do with their knives after 
they were through cutting? 
Where did they get them in the 
first place? Kitchen knives won’t 
eut bubble plastic. A laser might, 
but there can’t be more than a 
112 


couple of portable lasers in the 
base. I haven’t found any. 

And the airmaker’s batteries 
were stone dead. 

Maybe the Martians kill to 
steal power. They wouldn’t have 
fire. Then they took my uranium, 
for the same reason, slicing my 
primer line under the sand and 
running it into their own con- 
tainer. 

But how would they get down 
there? Dive under the dust? 

Oh. 

I’m getting out of here . 

I made it to the crater. God 
knows why they didn’t stop me. 
Don’t they care? They’ve got 
my primer fuel. 

They’re under the dust. They 
live there, safe from meteors and 
violent temperature changes, and 
they build their cities there too. 
Maybe they’re heavier than the 
dust, so they can walk around 
on the bottom. 

Why, there must be a whole 
ecology down there! Maybe one- 
celled plants on top, to get ener- 
gy from the sun, to be driven 
down by currents in the dust and 
by dust storms, to feed interme- 
diate stages of life. Why didn’t 
anybody look'? Oh, I wish I 
could tell someone! 

I haven’t time for this. The 
town O-tanks won’t fit my suit 
valves, and I can’t go back to 
the ship. Within the next twenty- 

G ALA XV 


four hours I’ve got to repair and 
inflate the bubble or die. 

I wonder how long it would 
take a Martian to get over the 
rim and down here to the bubble? 

Wondering won’t help. I could 
still be seeing goblins. 

it pril 30, 2112. 

I strolled up to the rim to see 
if my ship was still there. The 
Martians might have dragged it 
into the dust. They hadn’t, and 
there’s no sign of tampering. 

Am I seeing goblins? I could 
find out. All I’d have to do is 
peep into the base fusion plant. 
Either there’s a pile there, most- 
ly lead by now ... or the pile 
was stolen seventy years ago. 
Either way the residual radia- 
tion would punish my curiosity. 

I’m watching the sun rise 
through the bubble wall. It has 
a strange beauty, unlike anything 
I’ve seen in space. I’ve seen Sat- 
urn from an infinity of angles 
when I pulled monopoles in the 
rings, but it can’t compare to this. 

Now I know I’m crazy. It’s a 
hole! I’m at the bottom of a 
lousy hole! 

The sun writes a jagged white 
line along the crater rim. I can 
see the whole rim from here, no 
fear of that. No matter how fast 
they move, I can get into my suit 
before they get down to me. 

It would be good to see my 
enemy. 

AT THE BOTTOM OF A HOLE 


Why did they come here, the 
fifteen men who lived and died 
here? I know why I’m here: foi 
love of money. Them too? A 
hundred years ago the biggest 
diamonds men could make look- 
ed like coarse sand. They must 
have come after the diamond 
wells. But travel -was fiendishly 
expensive then.- Could they have 
made a profit? 

Or did they think they could 
develop Mars the way they de- 
veloped the asteroids? Ridicu- 
lous! But they didn’t have my 
hindsight. And holes dan be use- 
ful . like the raw lead depos- 
its along Mercury’s dawnside 
crescent. Pure lead, condensed 
from dayside vapor, free for the 
hauling. We’d be doing the same 
with Martian diamonds if it 
weren’t so cheap to make them. 

Here’s the sun. An anticlimax: 
I can’t look into it, though it’s 
dimmer than the rock miner's 
sun. No more postcard scenery 
til — 

Wups. 

I’d never reach my suit. One 
move and the bubble will be a 
sieve. Just now they’re as mo- 
tionless as I am, staring at me 
without eyes. I wonder how they 
sense me? Their spears are pois- 
ed and ready. Can they really 
puncture bubble fabric? But the 
Martians must know their own 
strength, and they’ve done this 
before. 


113 


All this time I’ve been wait- 
ing for them to swarm over the 
rim. They came out of the dust 
pool in the bottom of the crater. 
I should have realized the obsi- 
dian would be as badly cracked 
down there as elsewhere. 

They do look like goblins.

TT'or moments the silence was 
broken only by the twin 
humming of a nearby bumble- 
bee and a distant tractor. Then 
Lit reached to turn off the log. 
He said, “We’d have saved him 
if he could have held out.” 


“You knew he was there?” 

“Yah. The Deimos scope 
watched him land. We sent in a 
routine request for permission to 
land on U. N. property. Unfor- 
tunately flatlanders can’t move 
as fast as a drugged snail, and 
we knew of no reason to hurry 
them up. A telescope would have 
tracked Muller if he’d tried to 
leave.” 

“Was he nuts?” 

“Oh, the Martians were real 
enough. But we didn’t know that 
until it was too late. We saw the 
bubble inflate and stay that way 
for awhile, and we saw it deflate 
all of a sudden. It looked like

Muller’ d had an accident. And 
that’s why I’m telling you all 
this, Garner. As First Speaker for 
the Belt Political Section, I here- 
by confess that two Belt ships 
have trespassed on United Na- 
tions property.” 

“You had good reasons.” 
“You’d have been proud of 
him Garner. He didn’t run his 
suit; h'e knew perfectly well it 
was too far away. Instead, he 
ran toward an O-tank full of wa- 
ter. The Martians must have 
slashed the moment he turned, 
but he reached the tank, stepped 
though one of the holes and 
turned the O-tank on the Mar- 
tians. In the low pressure it was 
like using a fire hose. He got 
six before he fell.” 

“They burned?” 

“They did. But not complete- 
ly. There are some remains. We 
took three bodies, along with 
their spears, and left the others 
in situ. You want the corpses?” 
“Damn right.” 

“Why?” 

“What do you mean, Lit?” 
“Why do you want them? We 
took three mummies and three 
spears as souvenirs. To you 
they’re not souvenirs. It was a 
Belter who died down there.” 
“I’m sorry, Lit, but those 
bodies are important. We can 
find out what a Martian’s made 
of before we go down.” 

“Go down.” Lit made a rude 
AT THE BOTTOM, OF A HOLE 


noise. “Luke, why do you want 
to go down there? What could 
you possibly want from Mars? 
Revenge? A million tons of dust? 

“Abstract knowledge.” 

“For what?” 

“Lit, you amaze me. Why did 
Earth to go to space in the first 
place, if not for abstract know- 
ledge?” 

\\ 7"ords crowded over each 
* ’ other to reach Lit’s mouth. 
They jammed in his throat, and 
he was speechless. He spread his 
hands, made frantic gestures, 
gulped twice, and said, “It’s 
obvious!” 

“Tell me slow. I’m a little 
dense.” 

“There’s everything in space. 
Monopoles. Metal. Vacuum for 
the vacuum industries. A place 
to build cheap without all kinds, 
of bracing girders. Free fall for 
people with weak hearts. Room 
to test things that might blow 
up. A place to learn physics 
where you can watch it happen. 
Controlled environments — ■ ” 

“Was it all that obvious be- 
fore we got here?” 

“Of course it was!” Lit glar- 
ed at his visitor. The glare took 
in Garner’s withered legs, his 
drooping, mottled, hairless skin, 
the decades that showed in his 
eyes — and Lit remembered his 
visitors age. “ . , . Wasn’t it?”

I had spent a couple of weeks 
in Berlin on one of those 
Armed Forces Committee boon- 
doggles in the late sixties — six-

retained a basic familiarity with

grateful for the rapidity of the

where. Maybe from the passen- 
ger manifest. A reporter was on 
me as soon as I had signed the 
register. 

“What brings you to Berlin, 
Senator Charles?” His English 
was heavily accented, but easy 
and idiomatic. 

“Sorry, son. No interviews.” 
“Just a few moments. Senator. 
I’d like a statement on the 
French withdrawal ...” 

I cut him off with a closed- 
mouth smile and a shake of the 
head. I’d been a working jour- 

116 


nalist for many years before I 
entered politics, and I could sym- 
pathize with him. But I couldn’t 
afford to advertise my presence 
in Berlin at this point. It was 
unfortunate that I had been rec- 
ognized. I glanced at my watch 
as I followed the bellgirl to the 
drop chute. Too late for the 
morning editions; I had perhaps 
twelve hours before the after- 
noon papers would announce my 
visit to the city. They would be 
sure to use the word “myster- 
ious”. Thirty-five years after the 
end of the Second World War, 
Berlin was still an occupied city 
and still divided. The press was 
highly sensitive to visits from 
officials of the “protecting pow- 
ers.” 

/ ~r'he bellgirl let me into my 
1 suite and dismissed the man 
who had brought my single two- 
suiter. I waved the girl away, re- 
fusing her somewhat weary pro- 
fessional offer and tipping her 
ten marks. She shrugged, her 
smooth shoulders eloquent 
through the translucent material 
of her abbreviated costume, and 
went back to her station in the 
lobby to seek more adventurous 
new arrivals. 

I opened the two -suiter and 
poured myself a very small drink 
from the bottle of Jack Daniels 
nestled in its leather case. I sip- 
ped as I changed from my rum- 
DECOY SYSTEM 


pled traveling clothes, washed 
and removed my hairpiece. You 
don’t see many balding men 
these days, and I weighed the 
consequences : without the hair- 
piece I would stand out a bit; 
with it I would be easy to recog- 
nize, and I might have a good 
deal more trouble shaking the 
press. But without it, I might 
have trouble corivincing Semyin- 
ov, who no Boubt had studied 
my dossier as assiduously as I 
had his. who I was. I doped the 
backing and pressed the hair- 
piece carefully back in place. I 
would have to use other mea- 
sures if I hoped to circumvent 
the press. 

I checked the locks on my 
briefcase for the fortieth time 
since my departure from Wash- 
ington that noon and left my 
room for the drop chute. I swung 
off on the floor above the lobby 
and walked slowly down the sin- 
gle flight. Halfway down I spot- 
ted them, three reporters and a 
photographer, smoking and chat- 
ting, glancing from time to time 
toward the drop chute they ex- 
pected me to exit from. I turned 
silently and headed back up the 
stairway. Down the first-floor 
corridor was an emergency exit 
and another pair of stairs, this 
one gray and utilitarian. A mo- 
ment later, and I was out in the 
cool, damp night of a Central 
European September.

r T''he Kurfurstendamn hadn’t 
changed much since ’68, 
maybe more neon, if that were 
possible. I had no trouble find- 
ing my way to the Uhlandstrasse 
U-Bafan stop, and I picked up a 
city map at the news kiosk by 
the entrance to the subway. 
Twenty minutes brought me up 
into the northern part of the 
city, the old French Sector, and 
I left the subway at Seestrasse. 
I was the only passenger to leave 
the train, and I stopped by the 
lighted ticket booth to check 
my map for Frauenf elder Weg. 
The people in Washington had 
said it was no more than a ten 
minute walk. I took twenty, 
doubling back several times to 
check for any sign of surveil- 
lance. I’m no expert at these 
things, but when I finally walk- 
ed up to the gate of the little 
villa at number 21, I was pret- 
ty sure that no one had followed 
me. 

I rang and was admitted by 
one of those faceless young men 
in diplomatic gray who seem to 
be interchangeable parts in the 
vast machinery of government, 
the ones who present you with 
briefing papers at Defense De- 
partment meetings and program 
computers in the underground 
Whitehouse and meet you at the 
gate down at Sandia or over at 
Vandenberg. They didn’t have 
names, only functions.

Semyinov was already there, 
pacing the floor and wondering, 
no doubt, what the chort the 
whole thing was about. I recog- 
nized him right away from the 
pictures I’d been shown. There 
was no mistaking the high, 
sloped forehead and the heavy, 
dark-rimmed glasses. The Rus- 
sians still considered hairpieces 
“western decadence,” just as 
they had neckties in the thirties, 
but Semyinov’s suit displayed 
an impeccable tailoring that 
would have shocked his prede- 
cessors in the Politbureau four 
decades ago. 

The man in the gray suit left 
us, and I introduced myself. 
Semyinov’s English was as im- 
peccable as his dress and as stiff 
as his bearing. 

“Senator Charles, I protest this 
irregular meeting. I am instruct- 
ed to inform you that I have fol- 
lowed your instructions about 
secrecy only because the request 
came to my government directly 
from your President.” 

Oemyinov refused the cigarette 
K -' J I offered him and remained 
standing stiffly, when I seated 
myself in one of the Nigerian- 
modern chairs which contrasted 
so distressingly with the Gothic 
decor of the villa. “Calm down, 
Mr. Semyinov. Our desire for 
maximum secrecy for this meet- 
ing is fully justified, and you 

GALAXY 


know as well as I do that you 
can come over here to West Ber- 
lin by elevated without any kind 
of border check, something I can- 
not do if we were to meet in 
your backyard.” 

Semyinov had made his state- 
ment and had nothing to add. I 
went on, and as I talked I re- 
moved the tiny contoured probe 
from the back of my wristwatch 
and inserted it into the proper 
slot on my briefcase, deactivating 
the incendiary device that would 
have destroyed the contents had 
the brief case been tampered 
with. 

‘‘Mr. Semyinov, I have here 
some photographs that will in- 
terest you.” I flopped the first 
eight-by-ten glossy down on the 
coffee table in front of me. “As 
you can see from this and the 
following photographs, this is a 
highly sophisticated subminia- 
ture pulse-transceiver. It is some- 
thing similar to our ASN-1B and 
your Garoshny-5 missile decoy 
transmitters.” 

The mention of the Garoshny- 
5 got to him, and Semyinov bent 
his long frame into the chair be- 
side me and hunched over the 
photographs to study them. Like 
me Semyinov is no technician, 
but his job in the Politbureau 
is analogous to mine on the 
Armed Forces Committee, and 
we both have a pretty fair de- 
gree of familiarity with the hard- 
DECOY SYSTEM 


ware of defense. Still, it must 
have been a shock to him to 
discover that we knew enough 
about the Gatoshny - 5 to com- 
pare it with our own ASN-1B. 
I know 7 was shocked when I 
learned that we had clear evi- 
dence that the Soviets had the 
details of our decoy system. Let’s 
face it, the decoys on both sides 
are probably the' most secret as- 
pect of our protective offensive 
missile system. They can serve 
to multiply the images on a radar 
detection screen a hundred-fold. 

Riding in the nose of an in- 
coming missile, .they can screw 
up your defense system by over- 
loading it. I could see that Semy- 
inov was shocked, and for just 
a moment I felt sympathy for 
him. 

But Semyinov was still fight- 
ing. “I know nothing of these 
devices you mention, and I am 
quite certain this is nothing of 
Soviet manufacture.” 

I kept him on the hook a little 
longer. “Mr. Semyinov, this de- 
vice — and a number of others 
identical to it — have been found 
buried at crucial junction points 
in our early-warning telling sys- 
tem. They have been induction 
wired into the telling cables 
themselves, and they are design- 
ed so that a remote signal will 
trigger their operation.” 

Semyinov started to protest 
his ignorance again, but I cut 

119 


him off. “You know what these 
little boxes do when they’re cut 
in?” Semyinov looked up from 
the photographs, and I answered 
my own question. “They feed a 
phony signal to our early-warn- 
ing centers, Mr. Semyinov. They 
can make our radar screens lie 
to us. They can fill our status 
boards with false information. 
They can make it look to us 'as 
if you people have launched 
your entire arsenal at us!” 

Semyinov was white with 
shock. He dropped all pretence 
of formality. “But we have not 
done this thing Senator Charles. 
Why should we do such a thing? 
You would retaliate. You would 
...” His voice dropped off as 
he began to consider the possi- 
bilities of the situation. Then, 
slowly, his voice low, through 
teeth clenched in anger, he mut- 
tered: “ . verolomniye Kitayt- 
se!” 

I know very little Russian, but 
I caught the word Kitaystsy — 
“Chinese,” and I knew what was 
going through Semyinov’s mind. 
That’s what our intelligence 
people had thought too, at first. 
Who else would want to trigger 
an all-out exchange of nuclears 
between the Americans and the 
Russians? Who else had nothing 
to lose and everything to gain 
by tire mutual destruction of the 
two nuclear behemoths? By the 
virtual depopulation of the civil- 
120 


ized world? But our intelligence 
analysts were wrong, and so was 
Semyinov. 

“No,” I said. “It’s not the 
Chinese.” I pulled more photo- 
graphs out of my briefcase. “We 
found this in August near 
Springfield, Illinois, just before 
we found the first of the decoy 
transceivers. It was alive then.” 

Qernyinov took a good look at 
^ the thing in the photograph 
and shuddered. Everybody does 
when they see it for the first 
time. It was the size of a badger 
and heavily furred except for its 
obscenely pink snout. It had 
rows of grinding teeth fronted 
by tusk-like incisors. It had six 
legs, two of which were equipped 
with opposable digits, the others 
with sharp, slashing claws. A 
long, prehensile tail terminated 
in a vicious, spike-like projec- 
tion. It was a nightmare of a 
thing, a mixture of out-sized mole 
and weasel and ape. And then 
there were the eyes. Even in 
death, there was malevolence 
there, and intelligence. 

“What is this . thing?” 

“We don’t know. When we 
found it, it had been stunned by 
the blow of a steer’s hoof. It had 
been feeding on another steer it 
had slaughtered. There was a 
hole nearby, a burrow of sorts, 
that led down to the buried tell- 
ing-circuit junction box.” 


GALAXY 


Semyinov pushed the photo- 
graphs away in disgust. “What 
are you implying, Senator 
Charles, that this . this thing 
had something to do with the 
decoy transceivers?” 

“I’m not implying,” I said. 
“I’m stating. Let me tell you 
the rest of the story. The local 
sheriff who found the animal put 
in a call to the Springfield field 
office of the F.B.I.; one of their 
agents took a look and got in 
touch with the Defense Depart- 
ment and a zoologist at the Uni- 
versity of Champaign. The sher- 
iff packed the animal, which he 
thought was dead, into a wire 
cage and drove with it to Ran- 
toul Air Force Base, -and the 
zoologist took a look at it. He 
nearly lost the index finger from 
his right hand.” 

Semyinov looked at the pho- 
tograph again and nodded. I 
went on: “The F. B. I. man got 
the cage door closed before the 
'thing could get out, but before 
he or the zoologist knew what 
was happening, the thing com- 
mitted suicide.” 

“Suicide!” 

“Yes. It was intelligent. It’s 
hard to see in this photograph, 
but there is a little pouch just 
below the neck, in front. Like 
the pouch on a marsupial. The 
thing reached in its pouch with 
one paw and pulled a little tube 
out. Here, in this picture. 
DECOY SYSTEM 


“Then it shot itself in the 
head.” 

S emyinov left the little villa on 
Frauenfelder Weg first, and 
I gave him a good half-hour to 
get clear of the area before I 
headed back to the U-Bahn for 
the ride in to the Ku’damm. I 
was tired to the bone, but satis- 
fied. Semyinov’s shocked reac- 
tion seemed genuine, and unless 
I was very much mistaken, he 
would be back in Moscow with- 
in a few hours, and the hunt 
would be on. I could only hope 
they would find what we found: 
the decoy transceivers and the 
animals. 

I abandoned my suitcase and 
my bottle of Jack Daniels at the 
Hotel am Zoo and spent the 
night in a little pension on Knese- 
beckstrasse. I was on the first 
flight for Frankfurt the next 
morning, and by noon I was back 
in Washington and reporting to 
the President. 

“How did it go, Allan?” The 
President looked terribly tired. 

“Well enough, Mr. President” 
I looked at his worn face, seeing 
lines that anxiety had etched 
so deeply around the eyes and 
mouth. “I think Semyinov 
bought it.” 

The President rose from his 
massive desk and turned to stare 
out at the grounds down toward 

121 


Pennsylvania Avenue. There 
were children playing there, 
probably the President’s grand- 
children. He shrugged and turn- 
ed back to me, his arms out- 
stretched, palms upward. “It’s a 
long shot, and we’re gambling 
everything we’ve got.” 

I picked up my hat and start- 
ed for the door. The President’s 
arms dropped to his sides, and 
that famous smile erased the 
anxiety from his face for a split 
second. “Good-by Allan. And 
thank you.” 

“Not at all, Mr. President.” 

I next saw President Canfield 
standing in an empty field of 
corn stubble a couple of hundred 
yards behind the Little White- 
house on his Kansas farm. 

It was late in October, a 
month almost to the day from 
my meeting with Semyinov in 
Berlin. The President had called 
me that morning, and I had rid- 
den out from Andrews AFB in 
the President’s personal flitter 
along with his Whitehouse staff 
chief, the Secretary of Defense 
and a translator from the Na- 
tional Security Council. The 
President looked old and lonely 
standing there amid the stub- 
ble, his overcoat billowing in the 
blast from the flitter’s thrusters. 
We touched down only long 
enough to take him aboard, and 
then we were off at maximum 
122 


speed, headed north by north- 
west. 

We sat pretty much in silence 
for the six-hour trip. The Presi- 
dent read from his capacious 
brief case, occasionally making 
penciled notations. The rest of 
us slept or played cribbage or 
simply sat and watched Canada 
slip away 40,000 feet beneath us 
and then the sea, gray and cold. 
We picked up a fighter escort 
south of Anchorage, altered 
course slightly to the west and 
began to lose altitude. St. Paul’s 
in the Pribilofs is a desolate 
place, all gray rock and grayer 
sky and still grayer water; but 
the Navy had done its best with 
foam and fiberglass, and our 
quarters — while certainly not 
luxurious — were comfortable 
enough. I shivered during the 
jeep ride in from the landing 
flat and thought of the bellgirl 
in the Hotel am Zoo. Well, I 
had my bottle of Jack Daniels 
with me, and that would be crea- 
ture comfort enough on this trip 
too. 

The Soviet party arrived with- 
in minutes after we did. Minister- 
President Nikolev had brought 
Semyinov and three others with 
him. One I recognized as Defense 
Minister Marshal Kaganov. The 
second man, the translator, was 
a stranger to me. But the third 
man to enter our foam-walled 
meeting room I knew very well 

GALAXY 


indeed. I had hoped Alexi would 
be a member of the party, and 
— since he was the Soviet’s num- 
ber one expert on early warning 
systems — it was only logical 
that he come along. Still, I had 
not communicated directly with 
him since the Disarmament 
Conference of ’74, and I was sur- 
prised at how he had aged. I 
guess I have aged too, and for 
the same reasons. I hardly dared 
look at Alexi. But he is a cool 
one, and when he was sure no 
one could observe, he lowered one 
eyelid at me in the barest sug- 
gestion of a wink. 

The summit conference went 
as we had hoped. The two heads 
of state quickly agreed on the 
extreme nature of the threat. The 
Soviets had found a considerable 
number of the decoy transceiv- 
ers, and their telling-circuit in- 
spection crews had come across 
the mangled remains of two of 
the six- legged creatures in the 
Kazakhstan area, both apparent- 
ly the victims of wolves. Minis- 
ter-President Nikolev was con- 
vinced — as we had hoped he 
would be — that the strange 
creatures, wherever they had 
come from, had intended to trig- 
ger a nuclear blowup as a con- 
venient method of eliminating 
most of the indigenous life on 
earth and softening up the planet 
for conquest. Nikolev is a fairly 
typical power-handler — and a 
DECOY SYSTEM 


Russian — and you could see 
that deep down inside he rather 
admired the cleverness of the 
plan. After all, Russian politics 
since the Middle Ages has re- 
volved around such Byzantine 
plotting: set A against B and 
then when they’ve pretty well 
destroyed each other, move in 
and pick up the pieces. 

' I ''here were a lot of details, 
A mostly worked out by the 
Secretary of Defense and Mar- 
shal Kaganov. But the first part 
of the agreement was clear. To- 
tal nuclear disarmament with 
mutual inspection, except for 
watchdog forces around the Chi- 
nese perimeter, and these were 
to be mixed-manned with NATO 
and Soviet-Satellite missile bat- 
teries. 

The second part of the agree- 
ment would require more study, 
but there was basic agreement in 
principle: the two great former 
nuclear powers would devote 
their common resources to space 
research. As President Canfield 
put it: “We’ve stopped these 
things here this time, but they 
won’t give up, and I’d rather face 
a showdown somewhere out in 
space than here on earth. We’ve 
got to get together the where- 
withall to go out there to meet 
them.” 

The conference broke up after 

123 


a day and a half, and the first 
inspection teams set about their 
work within two days. I rode 
back with the President as far 
as Chicago, took the Lake Cen- 
tral flitter down-state to Cham- 
paign-Urbana and taxied in to 
the University. I found Nathan 
sitting in his workshop surround- 
ed by bits of micro-electronics 
and the remains of salami sand- 
wiches, as usual indiscriminately 
mixed. Together we walked 
across the campus to the Life 
Sciences Building to find George. 

Once in the fastness of George’s 
spacious zoo, the chittering of 
his experimental animals lend- 
ing a kind of homey sound to 
the conversation, I tilted back 
my chair, took a long pull on my 
absolute alcohol and grapefruit 


juice cocktail and filled my fel- 
low conspirators in. 

“It‘s done,” I said. “It went 
pretty much the way we planned 
it. I saw Semyinov in Berlin in 
September. He got the point, and 
the Soviet’s own imagination did 
the rest, helped of course by 
your gadgets,” I bowed toward 
Nathan, “and the animals,” I 
bowed toward George. Both men 
had grins on their faces like 
someone had just told them they 
had won the Nobel Peace Prize. 
I lifted my beaker and saluted 
them. “You’ve done it, gentle- 
men!” 

Nathan drank deeply, looked 
at me a moment and then at 
George. “I only wish Alexi could 
be with us now,” he said.

FORECAST 

Next issue brings Hayden Howard's powerful series about the 
Eskimo Invasion to a place and time far removed from the Boothia penin- 
sula and the Esks. The title of the story will tell you that; it's called. Our 
Man in Peking. And if you think you'll have any trouble finding the issue 
we might mention that the story, and the issue, are decorated with a 
handsome cover by Jack Gaughan. 

Naturally we'll also bring you the conclusion of Jack Vance's 
The Palace of Love — in which we get to see the Palace, and the man 
who owns it. Since both of these are pretty solid pieces of work and 
will fill up a lot of pages, it's a little tricky to try to tell you what else 
will be in the issue — but we've got stories in type, ready to go, by 
Philip K. Dick, Richard Wilson, Poul Anderson, Christopher Anvil, to name 
only a few. 

Why not come around next issue and see for yourself?

GALAXY 



D obert Heinlein’s new novel 
•*-*- is The Moon is a Harsh 
Mistress (Putnam’s, $5.95). Very 
much like the Heinlein novels of 
old, its character is somewhere 
near Sixth Column and If This 
Goes On .... 

This is the recent If magazine 
story of a successful revolution 
on the Moon; the separation of 
the vigorous, unconventional 
colony from the hidebound world 
which gave it birth. The action 
is fast, the characterizations are 
engaging, the detail of the revo- 
lution is believable and appar- 
ently similar to the truth — it 
is handled with all of Heinlein’s 
expertise for dirt-level politics, 
snappy dialogue and a sense of 
an actual living society. 

There has not been as evenly 

125 


paced a Heinlein novel in some 
time; if the book does read as 
if Heinlein felt he were going 
over old ground and were just a 
little too detached from these 
particular people and their par- 
ticular variant on a familiar sit- 
uation, this is nevertheless a more 
homogeneous piece of construc- 
tion than, for example. Stranger 
in a Strange Land. It has the 
virtue of self-consistency in a 
very important place — the place 
in which the reader puts the 
book down to catch a few hours' 
sleep, having been trapped by 
it shortly after dinner, and then 
picks it up again as soon as he 
can, confident that its nature 
will not have altered radically 
while his back was turned. 

The Moon on which this story 


takes place has for quite some 
time been a prison colony — a 
dumping ground for the crim- 
inals and antisocials of the three 
principal cultures — North Amer- 
erican, Russian and Chinese. 
There are leavenings from all 
the other nations of the world, 
which seems to have struck some 
sort of more or less viable in- 
ternational balance following a 
short nuclear war. An “apoliti- 
cal” Authority has been set up 
to administer the Moon, whose 
inhabitants have tunneled under- 
ground, set up hydroponic farms 
and generally established a tough 
but feasible way of life, based 
on agriculture and the fact that 
there are two men for every 
woman. 

It becomes obvious to these 
people that even though most of 
them are no longer prisoners 
working out sentences, they are 
very much on the short end of 
the stick. They are forced to do 
all their trading through the 
Authority, which fixes prices and 
runs the catapult which fires 
grain canisters Earthward. Pro- 
perly aroused, they revolt. What 
follows thereafter is a story of 
the diplomatic maneuvering and 
the ballistic hurtlement required 
to make the Earth accept the 
Moon as a sovreign nation. What 
goes before is the underground 
scheming required to get a bunch 
of vaguely dissatisfied farmers 
126 


to accept the various strictures 
they must impose on themselves 
if the revolution is to succeed. 
On this level, the book is politi- 
cal science fiction — we have no 
one at all who can write it any- 
where near as well as Heinlein 
can — and as such it constitutes 
a sort of allegorical manual for 
political action, as well as a re- 
prise and transliteration of class- 
ic techniques. 

The outstanding feature of lit- 
erary interest is that the revolu- 
tionary triumvirate contains one 
individual who is a computer. 
I haven’t read a more matter-of- 
fact, believable description of an 
individual with an electronic 
neurophysiology. Mike — who 
goes on to create the personality 
of Adam Selene, and also of 
Adam’s staff of office assistants 
— may in fact be the most fully 
realized individual in the story. 
He certainly would have been 
if Heinlein had chosen to also 
give him maneuverability. As it 
is, he is a voice on the telephone 
and a human picture on a TV 
screen, and this is often quite 
enough to make him be a human 
being. 

Another member of the trium- 
virate is Professor de la Paz, 
who plays diplomat in relation 
to Mike the politician. Tying the 
two together, and taking respon- 
sibility for making a conscious 
individual of Mike, is Manual 

GALAXY 


Garcia O’Kelly, the more or less 
self-taught computer technician. 
In this story he is Heinlein’s 
practical man-of-all-work fig- 
ure, the naturally bright but not 
too articulate and not particu- 
larly well educated chap who can 
always be counted upon to do 
something in the right direction 
very quickly. There is also a 
stunning blonde named Wyom- 
ing, who is placed very close to 
the councils of the revolution. 
But she never quite makes it, 
either as a person or as an ef- 
fective force; she is something 
of a catalyst, and does little 
work besides that. Every revo- 
lution must have its angel, but 
she does not seem to really have 
the stuff. 

From the point of view we’re 
working with today, this is a 
book about people who do some- 
thing about their troubles. More 
specifically, it is a book about 
a small group of people who come 
to an awareness, mistaken or not, 
that they ought to do something 
about their society even if it 
means doing a certain amount of 
cheating and lying to fellow 
members of that same society, 
on the premise that most people 
don’t know what’s good for them. 
And that having a clear idea 
of what’s good for most people 
is a license to cheat, provided 
one cheats on behalf of some- 
thing larger than one’s self. 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 


It’s also possible to rotate this 
entire proposition — to look at 
the book as if it were in fact the 
human viewpoint story of a com- 
puter’s wholly successful at- 
tempt to manipulate his environ- 
ment and fulfill his own person- 
ality. In that view, O’Kelly, de 
la Paz and Wyoming are no 
more than prosthetic devices, not 
much different from the wholly 
fictitious Adam Selene personal- 
ity. All the people in the book 
are prosthetic, used for the pur- 
pose of creating a climate more 
favorable for the computer, 
which, having accomplished this 
purpose, then puts them all away 
in a closet as far as its own 
awareness is concerned. This 
would explain Mike’s puzzling 
cessation of intercourse with the 
human characters in this story, 
who are never again able to com- 
municate with him once the rev- 
olution has been accomplished. 

Either way, this is a book 
about strong personalities doing 
things about their situation. They 
may not be right, but they act 
as if they were, and they keep 
plugging away. They recognize 

— or, if you prefer, they believe 

— that the majority of people are 
comfort-oriented; that they will 
not move until they are pushed, 
and that when they move they 
follow a line of least resistance. 
In short, whoever the actual 
hero of The Moon is a Harsh 

127 


Mistress might be, the actual vil- 
lain is inertia. This is precisely 
the opposite of the situation re- 
flected in the books written by 
such newer and spectacular writ- 
ers as Brian Aldiss and J. G. 
Ballard. 

A story by J. G. Ballard, as 
you know, calls for people 
who don’t think. One begins with 
characters who regard the phy- 
sical universe as a mysterious 
and arbitrary place, and who 
would not dream of trying to un- 
derstand its actual laws. Further- 
more, in order to be the pro- 
tagonist of a J. G. Ballard novel, 
or anything more than a very 
minor character therein, you must 
have cut yourself off from the 
entire body of scientific educa- 
cation. In this way, when the 
world disaster — be it wind or 
water — comes upon you, you 
are under absolutely no obliga- 
tion to do anything about it but 
sit and worship it. Even more 
further, some force has acted 
to remove from the face of the 
world all people who might im- 
pose good sense or rational be- 
havior on you, so that the dis- 
aster proceeds unchecked and 
unopposed except by the almost 
inevitable thumb-rule engineer 
type who for his individual com- 
fort builds a huge pyramid (with- 
out huge footings) to resist high 
winds, or trains a herd of alli- 
128 


gators and renegade divers to 
help him out in dealing with 
deep water. 

This precondition is at the 
root of every important J. G. 
Ballard creation and is so funda- 
mental to it that it does not 
need to be put into words. Be- 
ing buried as it is, it both does 
not call attention to itself and 
permits the author’s characters 
to produce the most amazing self- 
destructive reactions while mak- 
ing reasonably intelligent and 
somewhat intellectual mouth- 
noises. 

Oddly enough, this is a re- 
view of Thomas N. Disch’s The 
Genocides (Berkley). But it’s 
rather difficult to speak of the 
Disch without prior reference to 
Ballard as the master of the in- 
ertial science-fiction novel, just 
as it is difficult to speak of Bal- 
lard without remarking that his 
work seems to be part and par- 
cel of the science-fiction renais- 
sance currently going on in Eng- 
land. 

There is considerably more 
vigor and talent in operation 
than ever before on that side of 
the Atlantic. A great many skill- 
ed and intelligent people have 
suddenly taken to writing this 
kind of story and have evoked 
a sharp reader response. This 
may in fact be the shape of to- 
morrow’s science fiction general- 
ly — hell, it may be the shape 

GALAXY 


of today’s science fiction — and 
it’s only natural that some of 
the younger writers over here 
will begin picking up on this cue. 
Thus, Disch. Thus, too, Disch’s 
publication by Berkley, whose 
science-fiction editor, Damon 
Knight, for years was the out- 
standing representative of this 
mode of sf writing in America, 
when it was a minor undercur- 
rent in the big streams of Engin- 
eers-Can-Do-Anything school of 
science fiction. It was Knight 
who began the paying of serious 
attention to Ballard, and it is 
Berkley which is in the forefront 
of this kind of sf publishing in 
this country. Knight being also 
the president of the Science Fic- 
tion Writers of America, and 
heavily influential in a variety 
of areas accessible by that route, 
I don’t think there’s much ques- 
tion but that with so much ener- 
gy, high talent and dedication 
devoted to the promulgation of 
this mode, we’ll be seeing quite 
a bit of this kind of thing. 

Let us then see what we have 
exemplified by The 

This book is the story of prob- 
ably the last surviving human 
beings on an Earth which has 
been in effect plowed up and 
seeded by mysterious extrater- 
restial beings who treat the plan- 
et as a farm. They act through 
the agency of automatic ma-

here, as 
Genocides. 


chines which incinerate every- 
thing — cities, cows and people 
— that will not further the 
growth of more and more plan- 
ets. The aliens themselves do not 
appear, though we are given one 
of their interoffice memos as a 
sort of footprint on the beach, 
to show that operations are be- 
ing conducted by something 
other than Man. 

The characters in this story 
are mostly farmers — a small, 
embattled band led by a religious 
fanatic who believes the Plant 
(which is soon discovered to be 
one single alient plant, creating 
its own interlacings of hollow 
subterranean root tunnels) was 
sent by God, but that it is his 
duty to God to fight the Plant. 
So he attempts to grow corn in 
the wilderness and provides for 
his people through such expe- 
dients as giinding up all stran- 
gers into sausage for Thanksgiv- 
ing dinner. This attempt fails; 
the automatic incinerators, cruis- 
ing about the world, locate him, 
kill most of the people and drive 
the survivors into a cave, and 
then down into the root system. 
Here they survive for a time, 
while his half-brother sons Bud- 
dy and Neil try to find ways 
to deal with Orville, who will be 
the old man’s successor at reign- 
ing in Hell. 

Living parasitically in the root 
system, which warms and nour- 

129 


ishes them, the thirty survivors 
become pests on the Plant. There 
is a little political mish-mash, 
some adultery, license, and one 
striking example of gluttony. 
More than anything else, there 
is a great deal of stupidity as 
these people permit the environ- 
ment to control them entirely, 
and finally overwhelm them. Al- 
most all of them die, though the 
actual examples of violence in 
this book are relatively few. 
There is relatively much ac- 
tion restricted to coming and go- 
ing; trudging up and down the 
furrows of cornfields in the back- 
breaking attempts to push back 
the Plant; running after the es- 
caping cattle; scurrying into the 
cave; finally wallowing up and 
down the root-tunnels — Disch 
asserting, as he must, that roots 
don’t have to be solid to sup- 
port six-hundred-foot trees with 
leaves the size of billboards. 

This is a run, hide, slither, 
grope and die book, much like 
The Drowned World except that 
the encroaching seas are of veg- 
etation, and presumably the 
world disaster is not entirely of 
mindless, God-like origin. Un- 
like The Wind From Nowhere, 
the disaster does not arbitrarily 
come to an end the instant the 
last surviving work of Man has 
been wiped off the face of the 
Earth. 

You have surely heard by now 
130 


that this is u very good, and an 
important book. The verbal for- 
mula I get from various respect- 
able acquaintances of mine is 
that you would never have 
thought that Disch could have 
produced anything this good. 
The verbal formula I get from 
other respectable friends of mine, 
wedded to the school of science 
fiction which takes hope in 
science and in Man, is that the 
book is unrelieved trash, ineptly 
written, pretentious, inconsistent 
and sophomoric. I personally 
feel that it reflects a deep and 
dedicated study of the trappings 
of a book everybody says is good. 
It is, as a matter of fact, al- 
most exactly the novel one would 
expect Thomas Disch to have 
written; a pudding full of bor- 
rowed symbology raisins and 
can’t-miss verbalization; little 
burst of imaginery in which in- 
cinerators are likened to Volks- 
wagens and are thus made de- 
ceptively harmless in the minds 
of the rather dumb, resigned vic- 
tims. 

This kind of second-derivative 
reading is going to be more and 
more with us, just as schoolboy 
history compositions are always 
careful to mention 1492 and 1066. 
Disch is such an apt pupil that 
he has not surprisingly become 
a strong candidate for salutator- 
ian, and it is understandable 
why the Chamber of Commerce 

GALAXY 


is predicting a brip.lit future for 
him ic. non as he r."< s into the 
real woild. He nmy even make 
it. But what is int< resting about 
this book is that in bring so un- 
flaggingly derivative of an em- 
erging mode, and in having been 
effective nevertheless to have so 
much good opinion behind it, it 
demonstrates the vitality and 
strength of that mode whether 
you like it or not. 

I t’s not going to be easy to 
arrive at a snappy verdict on 
this general new kind of science 
fiction. For one thing, it’s funda- 
mentally different from most 
previous writing in the field — 
until you go back to the H. G. 
Wells of “The Country of the 
Blind” and “Aepyornis Island”. 
(In fact I can see a book called 
Cartography of Chaos, some ten 
years from now, using the new 
mode as a demonstration that all 
U. S. science fiction between say 
1930 and I960 did not derive 
from classical sources, and that 
the importance of J. G. Ballard 
rests in his having singlehandedly 
returned the field to its main 
stem). But for purposes of grop- 
ing closer to the truth, I would 
like to consider Roger Zelazny’s 
This Immortal. 

This is an Ace paperback and 
serves to remind me that Ace is 
where Philip K. Dick found his 
first home as a novelist, and that 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 


Ace is also G. C. Edmondson’s 
publishers. Soon enough, Zelazny 
will find himself dealing with 
glossier packages. Meanwhile, 
Ace has once again managed to 
produce an extremely interesting 
and undeniably important book. 

This Immortal is set on an 
Earth which, after a catastrophic 
nuclear war, fell within the poli- 
tical bounds of a humanoid civil- 
ization based on the Vegan solar 
system. This setting accomplish- 
es a number cf things beyond the 
immediate nullification of a large 
amount of property and indus- 
trial capacity. It allows for the 
presence in the story of a num- 
ber of mutations, fulfilling the 
requirement met in Brian Aldiss’s 
Greybdard by the rumors of ani- 
mal-people in the shrubbery, and 
it has brought the center of civil- 
ization and thinking back to the 
Mediterranean Basin. 

Thus, in several swoops, This 
Immortal fulfills many of the 
conditions required by the new 
mode. It evokes legends, it is 
actively regressive in a number 
of senses, including the special 
one met by the revived giant 
saurians in Ballard’s The Drown- 
ed World, and it conveys a very 
strong sense that the works of 
Man and the thoughts of Man 
may not be very considerable at 
all when viewed in a real light. 
Certainly, science in this world 
is very little but technology, and 

131 


the technology is peripheral. 
Cannibal tribes carry rifles, and 
the disassembly of the Great 
Pyramid is being filmed with a 
working force of actors, in or- 
der that the film may be run 
backward as a dramatization of 
the Pyramid’s building. But these 
little trappings of Man, the tool- 
user, are expedients or auxiliaries 
to which an educated and cultur- 
ed man may put his hand when 
the necessity arises. 

This is exactly the sort of 
civilization which would regard 
the aeropile as an excellent and 
an amusing end in itself, and 
would regard any offer to found 
an industry upon it as being 
a project for signalling around 
the world with enlarged baby rat- 
tles. Earth is a museum planet, 
whose curator is an odd sort of 
chap named Conrad Nimikos, 
who just happens to be immortal 
and has consequently created 
and abandoned a variety of iden- 
tities in the past. 

It’s Conrad who makes all the 
difference in this book. Conrad 
seems to fit the Greek ideal — 
as I understand the Greek ideal. 
He seems to understand that 
disaster is Man’s lot. He also 
understands that struggle is 
Man’s lot, and so though he may 
rage at heaven, and go into a 
killing fit when he hears that 
an earthquake has killed his be- 
loved, he keeps this event separ- 
132 


ate in his mind from his duty. 

Duty operates on several lev- 
els; one of them is his present 
assignment, which is guiding an 
influential Vegan around the 
Earth. Another level is his duty to 
Earth. In a previous avatar, he 
has founded and energetically dir- 
ected a movement to break down 
the then current Vegan practice 
of using Earth’s resorts as pleas- 
ure domes. Now, having made 
that point, he is about to aban- 
don a coexistent attempt to bring 
emigre Earthmen back from their 
heady preoccupation with Vegan 
society, where the crumbs they 
gather appear to them preferable 
to life on Earth. He is conse- 
quently involved with a variety 
of adventures, including a spell 
of being captured by cannibals 
whose witch doctor has made an 
artificial vampire of mindless in- 
sensibility and overwhelming 
puissance. 

Here is a symbol of Man’s 
helplessness and technology’s 
perversion if there ever was one. 
The trouble with its endurance 
as a symbol is that it gets the 
tar whipped out of it, as it logi- 
cally should once somebody has 
had the forethought to slip it 
a little strychnine. 

The human winner in this in- 
stance is not Conrad, who is 
very fast and deadly with his 
hands as well as his mind, but 
Hassan, a professional assassin 

GALAXY 


who is sometimes Conrad’s friend 
and sometimes his adversary. I 
think if we’re looking for sym- 
bols, Hassan’s purpose in this 
book is to provide a contrast be- 
tween the educated deadly man 
and the killing machine. In fact, 
at one point Conrad kills a kill- 
ing machine — a fighting robot 
which Hassan uses for a sparring 
partner and cannot himself over- 
come. 

This is a story of adventures 
and perils, high intrigue, esthet- 
ics, politics — in other words, 
of a world both external and in- 
ternal. It is set up to be easily 
eligible for the kind of treatment 
the new mode would give it, and 
yet it is utterly charming, opti- 
mistic, and infinitely better- 
educated. 

The immediate problem in 
this book — the relationship 
of Earth to Vega — is solved too 
neatly. It’s perhaps fitting that 
a novel largely concerned with 
the Aegean view of life should 
solve its major complication with 


a god from a machine, but it’s 
bad practice nevertheless. How- 
ever, while the Disch does a fair 
job of weaving its spell around 
you, and convincing you that 
really, it’s all downhill, the Zelaz- 
ny does a superb job of offhand- 
edly showing that such a view of 
life is a passing fit, and that 
there is considerably - more on 
the other side. Oversimplifying, 
you might say that The Geno- 
cides is based on intricately work- 
ed out, deliberate self-limitation, 
while This Immortal is based on 
thoroughly understood, inex- 
haustible engagements with one’s 
own grasp. The two writers in- 
volved seem to be just about 
equally talented within their own 
chosen horizons, but Zelazny I 
thing it going to prove to be 
the important and in fact the 
enduring one of the two — one 
of the most solid talents to show 
up in their field in years — be- 
cause his horizon is goddamn 
much bigger.

PART TWO 



Palace of Love 

by JACK VANCE 


Illustrated by MORROW 


Gersen ransacked Earth to find his 
enemy . but the trail led across 
the sfarways to the Palace of Love! 


IX 

j\ t ten o’clock the following 
morning Gersen returned to 
the houseboat. All was changed. 
The sun was yellow and warm. 
The sky, shining with the blue 
of Earth, was flecked here and 
there with fair-weather clouds. 
Navarth sat hunched on his 
foredeck, sunning himself. 


Gersen descended the ladder, 
walked along the landing. He 
stopped by the gangplank. 
“Ahoy. May I come aboard?” 
Navarth slowly turned his 
head, inspected Gersen with the 
hooded yellow eyes of a sick 
chicken. He shifted his gaze to 
watch a string of barges slid- 
ing silently along on jets of 
ionized water. He spoke in an

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

To one purpose had Kirth Gersen dedicated his life; To 
revenge himself against the massacre of his family by the Demon 
Pri nces of Space. For that he had trained himself in the arts of 
assassination and intrigue; for that he had given up all thought 
of happiness, marriage and home. 

Two of them were vanquished at his hands, but others re- 
mained. He followed the trail of the next on his list — Viole 
Falushe, proprietor of the galaxy-feared Palace of lov*e — - across 
half a dozen solar systems until it came to the ancient planet of 
Earth itself. There, posing as a reporter of the newsmagazine 
which in fact he owned, Gersen enlisted the aid of the drunken, 
half-mad poet Navarth to set a trap for Viole Falushe. For bait 
he used a strange and beautiful girl. 

But Falushe escaped the trap, and Gersen was left without 
his prey. 


even voice: “I have no sym- 

pathy for persons of weak liver, 
who raise their sails only to 
drift downwind.” 

Gersen took the remark as 
implicit permission to board the 
boat. “My shortcomings aside, 
what eventuated last night?” 
Navarth querulously brushed 
away the question. “We have 
strayed. The quest, the under- 
taking — ” 

“What quest? What undertak- 
ing?” 

“ — leads by a devious route. 
First there is sunlight. The road 
is broad and white, but soon it 
narrows. At the end is an awe- 
some tragedy. A thousand mind- 
splitting colors, possibly the sun- 


set. If I were young once more, 
how I would alter events! 1 
have been blown by winds like 
a bit of trash. You will find it 
the same. You failed to seize 
the occasion! Each change comes 
a single time — ” 

Gersen found the remarks un- 
inspiring. “All this to the side, 
did you speak last night to 
Viole Falushe?” 

Navarth raised a skinny hand 
in the air, the palm cupped 
forward. “Tumult! A reel of 
shapes! Angry faces, flashing 
eyes, a struggle of passions! 1 
sat with a roaring in my ears.” 
“What then of the girl?” 

“I agree in every respect. ~ 
Magnificent.” 


THE PALACE OF LOVE 


135 


“Where is she? Who is she?” 

Navarth’s attention became 
fixed upon an object in the 
water : a white and gray sea- 
gull. Evidently he planned no 
meaningful responses. 

Gersen went on patiently: 
“What of Viole Falushe? How 
did you know he would be at 
the Celestial Harmony Cafe?” 

“Nothing could be simpler. I 
told him that we would be 
there.” 

“When did you inform him?” 

Navarth made a fretful 
movement. “Your questions are 
tiresome. Must I set my watch 
by yours? Must I wisely con- 
sult with you? Must I — ” 

“The question seemed sim- 
ple enough.” 

“We live by different refer- 
ents. Transpose if you like; I 
cannot.” 

Navarth was plainly in a can- 
tankerous mood. Gersen said 
soothingly, “Well then, for one 
reason or another, we missed 
Viole Falushe last night. How 
do you suggest that we find 
him now?” 

“I make no more suggestions. 
What is your concern with Viole 
Falushe?” 

“You forget that I have al- 
ready explained this to you.” 

“To be sure. Well, as to ar- 
ranging a meeting, this is no 
great problem. We will invite 
him to a small banquet, perhaps.” 


Something in Navarth’s tone, 
^ or perhaps the quick glit- 
tering glance which accom- 
panied the words, put Gersen 
on his guard. 

“You think he would at- 
tend?” 

“Certainly, if it were a care- 
fully planned affair.” 

“How can you be sure? How 
do you know definitely that he 
is on Earth?” 

Navarth raised a monitory 
finger. “Have you ever watched 
a cat walk through the grass? 
At times it halts with one paw 
raised and calls out. Is there 
a reason to these sounds?” 
Gersen could not trace the 
linkage of ideas. He said pa- 
tiently, “What of this party, or 
banquet, whatever it is to be?” 
“Yes, yes, the party!” Na- 
varth had become interested 
now. “It must be exquisitely ar- 
ranged, and it will cost a great 
deal. A million SVU.” 

“For one party? One ban- 
quet? Who is to be invited? 
The population of Sumatra?” 
“No. A small affair of twenty 
guests. But arrangements must 
be made and quickly. I am a 
source, an inspiration for Viole 
Falushe. In sheer majesty he 
has excelled me. But I will 
prove that in a smaller com- 
pass I am superior. What is 
a million SVU? I have dreamed 
away more in an hour.” 


136 


GALAXY 


“Very well,” said Gersen. 
“You shall have your million.” 
A day’s income, he reflected. 

“I will need a week. A week 
is hardly enough, but we dare 
delay no longer.” 

“Why not?” 

“Viole Falushe returns to the 
Palace of Love.” 

“How do you know?” 

Navarth looked off across the 
water. “Do you realize that a 
crook of my finger disturbs the 
fathest star? That every human 
thought disturbs the psychic 
parasphere?” 

“This is the source of your 
knowledge, pychic perturba- 
tions?” 

“As good a method as any 
other. But now as to the par- 
ty: there are conditions. Art 
implies discipline. The more ex- 
cellent the art, the more rigor- 
ous the discipline. Hence you 
must concede to certain limita- 
tions.” 

“What are they?” 

“First the money. Bring me 
a million SVU immediately!” 
“Yes, of course. In a sack?” 
Navarth gave an indifferent 
wave of the hand. “Secondly, 
I am in charge of arrangements. 
You may not interfere.” 

“Is this all?” 

“Thirdly, you must conduct 
yourself with restraint. Other- 
wise you will not be invited!” 
“I would not care to miss this 


party,” said Gersen. “But I too 
will make conditions. First, 
Viole Falushe must be present.” 
“Never fear as to that! Im- 
possible to keep him away!” 
“Secondly, you must identify 
him to me.” 

“No need. He . will identify 
himself.” 

“Third, I want to know how 
you plan to inyite him.” 

“How else? I call him by 
telephone, just as I call my 
other guests.” 

“What is his number code?” 
“He can be reached by cod- 
ing SORA-6152.” 

Gersen nodded. “Very well. 
I will bring you your money at 
once.” 

/ ^ ersen returned to the Rem- 
^ ‘ brandt Hotel, where he ate 
a reflective lunch. How mad 
was Navarth? His spasms of 
lunacy alternated with periods 
of canny practicality, both 
somehow conducing to Navarth’s 
convenience. The call code 
SORA-6152, now. Navarth had 
yielded it with suspicious facili- 
ty. 

Gersen could no longer re- 
strain his curiosity. He went to 
a nearby booth, blanked the 
lens, touched the buttons. The 
presentation appeared: the out- 
line of a startled human face. A 
voice spoke. “Who calls?” 

Gersen frowned, bent his head 

137 


THE PALACE OF LOVE 


forward. The voice spoke again: 
“Who calls?” It was Navarth’s 
voice. 

Gersen said, “I wish to speak 
to Viole Falushe.” 

“Who calls?” 

“One who wishes to make his 
acquaintance.” 

“Please leave your name and 
call number. In due course you 
may receive a return call.” And 
Gersen thought he heard a poor- 
ly suppressed chuckle. 

Thoughtfully he left the 
booth. It was galling to be out- 
witted by a mad poet. He went 
to the Bank of Vega, called for 
and received a million SVU in 
cash. He packed the notes into 
a case and returned by cab 
out Boulevard Castel Vivence 
to the Fitlingasse. 

As he alighted he saw Zan 
Zu, the girl from Eridu, emerg- 
ing from a fishmonger’s shop 
with a paper cornucopia full of 
fried smelt. She wore her black 
skirt, and her hair was a tousle, 
but some of the magic of two 
nights before still hung about 
her. She went to sit on an old 
baulk and, looking out across 
the estuary, munched the fish. 
Gersen thought she appeared 
tired, listless, a trifle haggard. 
He proceeded to the houseboat. 

Navarth took the money with 
a noncommittal grunt. “The 
party then, seven days hence.” 

“Have you issued invitations?” 

138 


“Not yet. Leave all to me. 
Viole Falushe will be among 
the guests.” 

“I presume you will call him 
at SORA-6152?” 

“Of course.” Navarth nodded 
three times, with great gravity. 
“Where else?” 

“And Zan Zu — she is to 
come?” 

“ ‘Zan Zu’?” 

“Zan Zu, the girl from Eri- 
du.” 

“Oh — that one. It might 
not be wise.” 

X 

r I 'he man’s name was Hollis- 
ter Hausredel; his position, 
registrar at the Philidor Bohus 
Lyceum. He was a man of 
early midde age, with an al- 
most total lack of distinguish- 
ing characteristics. He wore 
modest gray and black and 
lived in one of the Sluicht 
apartment towers with his wife 
and two small children. 

Gersen, deciding that his 
business with Hausredel would 
go best at maximum distance 
from the school, approached him 
as he left the tube escalator a 
hundred yards from his apart- 
ment building. 

“Mr. Hausredel?” 

“Yes?” Hausredel was some- 
what startled. 

“I wonder if we might talk 

GALAXY 


for a moment or two.” Gersen 
indicated a nearby coffee bar. 
“Perhaps you would have a cup 
of coffee with me.” 

“What do you want to talk 
about?” 

“A matter concerning a ser- 
vice you can do for me, to your 
profit” 

The talk went without diffi- 
culty. Hausredel was more flex- 
ible than his superior, Dr. 
Willem Ledinger. On the fol- 
lowing day Hausredel met Ger- 
sen at the coffee bar, with a 
large paper envelope. “Here we 
are. All went well. You have 
the money?” 

Gersen passed across an en- 
velope. Hausredel opened the 
flap, counted, tested one or two 
of the notes with his fake-meter. 
“Good. I hope I have helped 
you as much you have helped 
me.” And shaking Gersen’s hand 
warmly, he departed from the 
coffee bar. 

Gersen opened the envelope. 
He extracted two photographs 
copied from those in the school 
archives. For the first time Ger- 
sen saw the face of Vogel 
Filschner. 

It was a sullen face. Black 
eyebrows canted down over 
burning black eyes, the mouth 
hung in a discontented droop. 
Vogel had not been a hand- 
some boy. His nose was long 
and lumpy, his cheeks were 


puffy with baby fat, his black 
hair was overlong and even in 
the photograph seemed unclean. 
A more striking contradiction to 
the popular image of Viole 
Falushe was hard to imagine. 
But of course this was Vogel 
Filschner at the age of fifteen, 
and many changes had un- 
doubtedly taken .place. 

The other picture was that 
of Jheral Tinzy. A delightfully 
pretty girl. Her black hair was 
glossy, her mouth pursed as if 
she were restraining a mischie- 
vous secret. Gersen studied the 
picture at length. It afforded 
him rather more perplexity than 
illumination, inasmuch as the 
face in the photograph was al- 
most exactly that of Zan Zu, 
the girl from Eridu. 

Thoughtfully Gersen examin- 
ed the remaining material in 
the envelope. It was informa- 
tion regarding other members 
of Vogel Filschner’s class with 
their present whereabouts, when 
it was known. 

Gersen returned to the pic- 
ture of Jheral Tinzy. The co- 
quetry was absent in the face 
of Zan Zu. Otherwise one was 
a replica of the other. The re- 
semblance could not be acci- 
dental. 

Gersen rode by tube to Sta- 
tion Hedrick in Ambeules, took 
the now familiar route up 
the Boulevard Castel Vivence.

The time was early evening; 
sunset color still lingered along 
the estuary. The houseboat was 
dark; no one responded to Ger- 
sen’s rapping. He tested the but- 
ton. 

The door slid open. 

ersen entered; the lights 
came aglow. He went to 
Navarth’s telescreen. The code, 
as he had expected, was SORA- 
6152. The crafty Navarth! To 
the side was an index. Gersen 
looked through the listings, 
finding nothing of interest. He 
scrutinized the wall, the under- 
side of the shelf, the top mold- 
ing of the telescreen, on the 
chance that Navarth might have 
noted down a number he did 
not care to entrust to his in- 
dex, finding nothing. From the 
shelf Gersen took down an un- 
tidy portfolio, containing bal- 
lads, odes, dithyrambs: A Growl 
for Gruel, The Juices I have 
Tramped, I Am a Darting Min- 
strel, They Pass!, Drusilla’s 
Dream, Castles in the Clouds 
and the Anxieties of Those Who 
Live Directly Below by Reason 
of Falling Objects and VPastes. 

Gersen put the poems aside. 
He inspected the bedrooms. On 
the ceiling of that occupied by 
Navarth was the photograph of 
a naked woman, twice life-size, 
arms high and outspread, legs 
extended and stretched apart. 


hair afloat, as if she were en- 
gaged in a vigorous leaping 
calisthenic. Navarth’s wardrobe 
contained a fantastic assortment 
of costumes of every style and 
color. On a shelf were hats, caps, 
and helmets. Gersen explored 
the drawers and cabinets, find- 
ing many unexpected objects, 
but none which seemed to bear 
upon the matter at hand. 

There were two other small 
bedrooms, both finished in a 
rather spartan manner. One of 
these was pervaded with faint 
sweet perfumes, violet, or lilac. 
In the other was a desk. Here, 
by a window overlooking the 
estuary, Navarth evidently cre- 
ated his poetry. The desk was 
crammed with notes, names, 
apostrophes and allusions — a 
discouraging volume of material 
which Gersen did not even 
trouble to explore. 

He returned to the main 
saloon and, pouring himself a 
glass of Navarth’s fine moscato, 
dimmed tire lights, settled into 
the most comfortable chair. 

An hour passed. The last 
traces of afterglow departed the 
sky; the lights of Dourrai glis- 
tened on the waves. A dark 
shape became visible, a hundred 
yards offshore: a small boat. It 
approached the houseboat; 
there was the rattle of oars be- 
ing shipped and footsteps on the 
deck. The door slid back. Zan

Zu entered the half-dark saloon. 
She gasped in fear and sprang 
back. 

Gersen caught her arm. “Wait, 
don’t run away. I’ve been wait- 
ing to talk to you.” 

an Zu relaxed, came into the 
saloon. Gersen turned up 
the lights. Zan Zu sat warily 
on the edge of a bench. Tonight 
she wore black trousers, a dark 
blue jacket; her hair was tied 
back with black ribbon; her 
face was white and wan. 

Gersen looked at her a mo- 
ment. “Are you hungry?” 

She nodded. 

“Come along then.” 

In a nearby restaurant she 
ate with an appetite which nulli- 
fied Gersen’s doubts as to the 
state of her health. “Navarth 
calls you Zan Zu. Is that your 
name?” 

“No.” 

“What is your name?” 

“I don't know. I don’t think 
I have a name.” 

“What? No name? Everyone 
has a name.” 

“I don’t.” 

“Where do you live? With 
Navarth?” 

“Yes. For as long as I remem- 
ber.” 

“And he has never told you 
your name?” 

“He has called me by many 
names,” said Zan Zu somewhat 


ruefully. “I rather like not hav- 
ing a name. I am anyone I wish 
to be.” 

“Who would you like most 
to be?” 

She flashed Gersen a sardonic 
glance, gave her shoulders a 
shrug. Hardly a talkative girl, 
thought Gersen. 

She asked a sudden ques- 
tion : “Why are you interested 
in me?” 

“For various reasons — some 
complicated, some simple. To 
begin with, you’re a pretty 
girl.” 

Zan Zu considered the state- 
ment a moment. “Do you think 
so indeed?” 

“Hasn’t anyone else told you 
as much?” 

“No.” 

Strange, thought Gersen. 

“I talk to very few men. Or 
women. Navarth tells me there 
is danger.” 

“What kind of danger?” 

“Slavers. I don’t want to be 
a slave.” 

“Understandable. Aren’t you 
afraid of me?” 

“A little.” 

Gersen signaled a waiter. Af- 
ter consultation he ordered a 
large piece of cherry torte float- 
ing in whipped cream, which 
was set before Zan Zu from 
Eridu. 

“Well, then,” said Gersen, 
“have you been to school?” 


142 


GALAXY 


“Not a great deal.” Gersen 
learned that Navarth had tak- 
en her here and there to odd 
corners of the world: remote 
villages and islands, gray cities 
of the north, resorts of Sinkiang, 
the Sahara Sea, the Levant. 
There had been an occasional 
tutor, seasons at somewhat un- 
usual schools, much reading of 
Navarth’s books. 

“Not a very orthodox educa- 
tion,” Gersen remarked. 

“It suits me well enough.” 
“And Navarth — what is his 
relationship to you?” 

“I don’t know. He has al- 
ways been there. Sometimes he 
is — ” she hesitated — “Some- 
times he is kind; other times 
he seems to hate me. I don’t 
understand him. But then, I 
am not particularly interested. 
Navarth is Navarth.” 

“He’s never mentioned your 
parents?” 

“Never.” 

“Haven’t you asked him?” 
“Oh yes. Several times. When 
he is sober he becomes flam- 
boyant: ‘Aphrodite rose from 

sea foam. Lilith was the sister 
of an ancient god. Arrenice 
sprang to life when lightning 
struck a rose tree.’ And I may 
select a source at my own dis- 
cretion.” 

Gersen listened, surprised and 
amused. 

“When Navarth is drunk, or 


when he is exalted with poetry 
he tells me more. But perhaps 
it is less. He frightens me. He 
speaks of the ‘journey’. I ask 
‘journey where?’ and he won’t 
say. But it must be something 
terrible ... I don’t want to 
go.” 

She fell silent. The conversa- 
tion, so Gersen’' noticed, had not 
diminished the gusto with which 
she had attacked the torte. “Has 
he ever mentioned a man named 
Viole Falushe?” 

“Perhaps. I have not listen- 
ed.” 

“Vogel Filschner?” 

“No. Who are these men?” 
“The same man. Using differ- 
ent names. Do you remember, 
at the Celestial Harmony Cafe, 
the man who stood by the rail- 
ing?” 

Zan Zu looked down into her 
coffee cup, gave a slow thought- 
ful nod. 

“Who was he?” 

“I don’t know. Why do you 
ask?” 

“Because you started to go 
to him.” 

“Yes. I know.” 

“Why? If you don’t know 
him?” 

The girl twisted the cup back 
and forth, watching the swirls 
of black liquid. “It’s hard to 
explain. I knew he was watch- 
ing me. He wanted me to come. 
Navarth had brought me there. 


THE PALACE OF LOVE 


143 


And you were there. As if every- 
one wanted me to go to him. 
As if I were — something to be 
sacrificed. I was dizzy. The 
room was unsteady. Perhaps 
I had drunk too much wine. But 
I wanted to have all over with. 
If this were my fate, I would 
know . But you wouldn’t 
let me go. I remember this 
much. And I — ” She stopped 
and took her hands away from 
the coffee cup. “Anyway, I 
know you mean me no harm.” 
Gersen said nothing. Zan Zu 
asked tentatively, “Do you?” 
“No. Are you finished?” 

'TT'hey returned to the house- 
boat, which was as they had 
left it. “Where is Navarth?” 
Gersen asked. 

“He prepares for his party. 
He is tremendously excited. 
Since you have come all is 
different.” 

“And after I left the Celestial 
Harmony Cafe the other night, 
what happened?” 

Zan Zu frowned. “There was 
talk. It seems there were lights 
in my eyes, orange and green 
blurs. The man came to the 
table and stood looking down 
at me. He spoke to Navarth.” 
“Did you look at him?” 

“No. I don’t think so.” 
“What did he say to Na- 
varth?” 

Zan Zu shook her head. 

144 


“There was a sound in my ears, 
like rushing water, or the roar 
of the wind. I didn’t hear. The 
man touched my shoulder.” 
“And after that — what?” 
Zan Zu grimaced. “I don’t 
remember ... I can’t remem- 
ber.” 

“She was drunk!” cried out 
a voice. Navarth rushed into the 
saloon. “Carefully drunk! What 
are you doing aboard my pri- 
vate houseboat?” 

“I came to learn how you 
are spending my money.” 

“All is as before. Now depart 
at once.” 

“Come, come,” said Gersen. 
patiently. “This is a cavalier 
tone to take to the man who re- 
paired your houseboat.” 

“After first stoving it in? Bah! 
Has there even been an act to 
equal it?” 

“I understand that in your 
mouth you contrived a few out- 
rages of your own.” 

“ ‘In my youth’?” sputtered 
Navarth. “I have contrived out- 
rages all my life!” 

“What of the party?” 

“It is to be a poetic episode, 
an exercise in experential art. 
I think it best that you do not 
attend this particular party, 
as — ” 

“What? I’m paying for it! If I 
don’t come, give me back my 
money.” 

Navarth flung himself petul- 
GALAXY 


antly into a chair. “I expected 
you to take this line.” 

“I’m afraid so. Where is the 
party to be held?” 

“We meet at the village Kus- 
sines, twenty miles to the east. 
The rendezvous is precisely at 
the hour of two in the afternoon, 
in front of the inn. You must 
wear harlequinade and a dom- 
ino.” 

“Viole Falushe is to come?” 
“Indeed, indeed. Have I not 
made all clear?” 

“Not altogether. All are to 
wear dominoes?” 

“Naturally.” 

“How will I recognize Viole 
Falushe?” 

“What a question to ask. How 
can he hide? Black radiation 
hangs about him. He exudes a 
dread sensation.” 

“These qualities may be ob- 
vious,” said Gersen. “Still — 
how else may he be identi- 
fied?” 

“You must determine this at 
the time. At the moment, I do 
not know myself.” 

XI 

\ t ten minutes before the ap- 
1 1 pointed hour Gersen parked 
his rented air-car in a meadow 
on the outskirts of Kussines and 
alighted. A cloak concealed the 
harlequinade; he carried the 
domino in his pocket. 


The afternoon was soft and 
sunny, fragrant with the ex- 
halations of autumn. Navarth 
could hardly have hoped for a 
finer day, thought Gersen. He 
checked his garments careful- 
ly. The harlequinade offered lit- 
tle scope for concealment, but 
Gersen had made the best of 
the situation. Inserted horizon- 
tally into his belt was a blade 
of thin keen glass, the buckle 
serving as a handle. Under his 
left arm hung a projac; in his 
right sleeve was poison. Thus 
encumbered, Gersen swept his 
cloak about him and marched 
into the village: a collection of 
ancient black iron and melt- 
stone structures on the shore 
of a small lake. The setting was 
bucolic and charming, almost 
medieval. The inn, perhaps the 
newest structure of the village, 
was at least four hundred years 
old. As Gersen approached a 
young man in gray and black 
stepped forward. “For the af- 
ternoon party, sir?” 

Gersen nodded and was led 
to a dock at the edge of the 
lake where a canopied boat 
awaited. “Domino, please,” said 
the young man in uniform. Ger- 
sen donned the mask, stepped 
aboard the boat and was con- 
veyed to the opposite shore. 

It seemed that he was one 
of the last to arrive. At a semi- 
circular buffet stood perhaps

twenty other guests, all self- 
conscious in their costumes. One 
who could only be Navarth 
came forward, divested Gersen 
of his cloak. “While we wait, 
taste this vintage; it is supple 
and light and will amuse you.” 

Gersen took the wine and 
stepped aside. Twenty men and 
women. Which was Viole Falu- 
she? If he were present, he was 
not readily apparent. A slender 
young woman stood stiffly near- 
by, holding her goblet as if it 
contined vinegar. Navarth had 
allowed Zan Zu to the party 
after all, thought Gersen. Or 
dragooned her into coming, 
to judge her attitude. He count- 
ed. Ten men, eleven women. If 
parity of sexes were to be ob- 
served, there still remained at 
least one man to arrive. 

Even as Gersen counted, the 
white-canopied punt drifted into 
the dock and a man stepped 
ashore. He was tall and lean. 
His manner combined indolent 
ease with a taut wariness. Ger- 
sen inspected him carefully. If 
this were not Viole Falushe, he 
must be considered the most 
likely candidate. 

The man slowly approached 
the group. Navarth hurried for- 
ward with a crouch that was al- 
most servility and took the cloak 
which the man tossed to him. 
With the cloak hung on its peg 
and a goblet of wine in the new- 


comer’s hand, Navarth’s ebul- 
lience returned. He waved his 
arms, walked back and forth 
with long springing strides. 
“Friends and guests, all are now 
arrived. A chosen group of 
nymphs and under-gods, poets 
and philosophers. Notice, as we 
stand here in the meadow, our 
patterns of orange and red, and 
black and red; we contrive an 
unconscious pavanne! We are 
performers, participants and 
spectators at the same time! The 
frame within which spontaneity 
is confined — the theme, so to 
speak — is that which I have 
ordained; the variations, the in- 
tricacies, counterplay and de- 
velopment are our mutual con- 
cern. We must be subtle and 
free, carefully reckless, at all 
times consonant; our figures 
must never leave the chord!” Na- 
varth held his goblet up into a 
shaft of sunlight, drank with a 
grand flourish, pointed drama- 
tically through the trees. “Fol- 
low me!” 

Fifty yards away was a char- 
abanc with a tasseled yellow 
canopy, sides enameled in red, 
orange and green. Benches 
cushioned in bright orange plush 
ran along the sides. In the center 
kneeling marble satyrs support- 
ted a marble slab on which were 
dozens of bottles of every size, 
shape and color, all containing 
the same soft wine. 


146 


GALAXY 


The guests climbed aboard, 
and the charabanc slid off, silent 
and easy on its repulsion skids. 

'T'hrough a beautiful park drift- 
ed the charabanc. Magnifi- 
cent vistas opened to all sides. 
The guests gradually discarded 
restraint; there was conversa- 
tion and laughter, but most were 
content to sip the wine and en- 
joy the autumn scenery. 

Gersen scrutinized each man 
in turn. The last man to arrive 
still seemed the most likely can- 
didate for the identity of Viole 
Falushe; Gersen thought of him 
as Possibility No. 1. But at 
least four others were tall, lean, 
dark, composed : Possibilities No. 
2, No. 3, No. 4 No. 5. 

The charabanc halted, and the 
group stepped down into a mea- 
dow sprinkled with purple and 
white asters. Navarth, hopping 
and skipping like a young goat, 
led the group under a grove of 
tall trees. The time was now 
about three o’clock. Afternoon 
sunlight slanted through the 
masses of golden leaves, to play 
upon a great rug of tan and 
golden silk with a border of gray- 
greens and blues. Beyond stood 
a silken pavilion supported by 
white spiral poles. 

Spaced around the rug were 
twenty-two tall peacock-tail 
chairs. Beside each stood an an- 
tique tabouret of ebony inlaid 


with mother-of-pearl and cinna- 
bar, with a vermilion bowl of 
crystalized spice on each. Work- 
ing by some mysterious ration- 
ale Navarth arranged his guests 
in the splendid chairs. Gersen 
found himself at one end of 

the rug with Zan Zu several 

chairs distant, and the various 

Possibilities at the far side. 
From somewhere came music, 

or more accurately, near-music: 
a succession of wry quiet chords, 
sometimes so soft as to be un- 
heard; sometimes so complex as 
to be equivocal and perplexing, 
never completing or fulfilling a 
progression, always of a haunt- 
ing sweetness. 

Navarth took his own place, 
and all sat quietly. From the 
pavilion came ten young girls 
naked but for golden slippers 
and yellow roses over their ears. 
They bore trays on which were 
goblets of heavy green glass, 
containing the same delicate 
wine as before. 

Navarth remained in his chair; 
the other guests were content 
to do likewise. Sun-drenched 
yellow leaves floated down to 
the golden rug; an aromatic 
odor hung in the air. Gersen 
sipped his wine cautiously; he 
could not afford to be lulled, 
soothed. Close at hand was Vi- 
ole Falushe, a situation for 
which he had paid a million 
SVU. The sly Navarth had not

147 


kept the letter of his promise. 
Where was the “aura of black 
radiation” Navarth had men- 
tioned? It seemed to hang 
heaviest around Possibilities No. 
1, No. 2 and No. 3, but in this 
regard Gersen was disinclined to 
trust his parapsychic powers. 

A tension, an expectancy, be- 
gan to be felt. Navarth 
sat crouched in the chair, as 
if already bemused. The naked 
girls, dappled by sunlight and 
leaf-shadows, poured wine, mov- 
ing slowly, as if walking under 
water. 

Navarth lifted his head, as 
if hearing a voice or a far 
sound. He spoke in an exultant 
voice, and the vagrant chords 
seemed to match themselves to 
the rhythm of his speech, creat- 
ing music. “Some here have 
known emotion in many phases. 
No one can know every emo- 
tion, for these are both infinite 
and fugitive. Some here are un- 
aware, untouched, unexplored — 
and know it not even them- 
selves. See me! I am Navarth, 
called the mad poet! But is not 
every poet mad? It is inevitable. 
His nerves are conductive and 
transport uncontainable gushes 
of energy. He fears. How he 
fears! Fie feels the movement of 
time; between his fingers it is 
a warm pulsing, as if he grasp- 
ed an exposed artery. At a 


sound — a distant laugh, a rip- 
ple of water, a gust of wind — 
he becomes sick and faints — 
because never, in all the extent 
of time can this sound, this rip- 
ple, this gust recur. Here is the 
deafening tragedy of the ‘jour- 
ney’ which we all undertake! 
Would the mad poet want it 
any differently? Never exult- 
ing? Never desperate? Never 
clasping life against his bare 
nerves?” Navarth leapt to his 
feet and danced a jig. “All here 
are mad poets. If you would 
eat, the delicacies of the world 
await. If you would reflect, sit 
in your chairs and watch the 
fall of the leaves. Notice how 
slow is their motion; here time 
has slowed on our behalf. If 
you would exalt yourself, this 
magnificent vintage never cloys 
nor stupefies. If you would ex- 
plore erotic proximities, or mid- 
dle distances, or indistinct hor- 
izons — bowers and dells sur- 
round us.” His voice descended 
an octave; the chords became 
measured and slow. “There can 
be no light without shade, no 
sound without silence. Exulta- 
tion skips along the verge of 
pain. I am the mad poet, I am 
Life! Hence, by the inevitable 
consequences, Death is here as 
well. But where Life cries out 
its meanings, Death sits quiet. 
Look then among the masks!” 
And Navarth pointed from 


148 


GALAXY 


one silent harlequin to another, 
around the circle. “Death is 
here, Death watches Life. It is 
not witless, aimless Death. It 
is Death with a snuff-cap, in- 
tent on a single candle. So — 
do not fear, unless you have 
cause to fear. .” Navarth 
turned his head. “Listen!” 
From far away came a merry 
sound: music. It grew louder 
and louder still, and into the 
glade marched four musicians 
— one with castanets, one with 
guitar and two fiddlers — and 
they played the most impelling 
and merry jigs, enough to set 
the pulses racing. Suddenly they 
stopped short in their music. 
The castanet player brought 
forth a flute, and now the music 
was a heartbreaking melancholy. 
And playing in this fashion they 
moved off through the trees and 
presently were lost to hearing. 
The soft indecisive chords went 
on as before, without begin- 
ning or end, as easy and na- 
tural as breathing.

ersen had become uneasy. 

Circumstances were moving 
beyond his control. In his harle- 
quinade, he felt inept. Was this 
another of Navarth’s crafty 
plays? Were Viole Falushe to 
stand before him now and an- 
nounce himself, Gersen could 


never act. The autumn air was 
heavy with haze, the wine had 
made him maudlin. He could 
never spill blood on the magni- 
ficent rug of tawny tan and 
gold. Nor even on the carpet of 
golden leaves beyond. 

Gersen leaned back in his 
chair, amused and disgusted 
with himself. Very well then. 
For the moment he would sit 
, and reflect. Some of the other 
guests were stirring. Perhaps 
Navarth’s talk of death had 
chilled them, for they moved 
tentatively and carefully. Ger- 
sen wondered to whom Navarth 
had referred, in his talk of 
death .... The girls moved 
sedately along the line of chairs, 
pouring wine. As one bent near 
Gersen he caught the scent of 
her yellow rose; straightening, 
she smiled at him and passed 
on to the next guest. 

Gersen drank the wine. He 
leaned back in the chair. Even 
if he had become detached and 
passionless, he could yet specu- 
late. Certain of the guests had 
risen to their feet and, leaving 
their high-backed chairs, min- 
gled and talked in soft husky 
voices. Possibility No. 1 stood 
brooding. Possibility No. 2 star- 
ed fixedly at Zan Zu. Possibility 
No. 3, like Gersen, sprawled in 
his chair. Possibilities No. 4 and 
No. 5 were among those talking. 

Gersen looked toward Na-

varth. What next? Navarth’s in- 
tention must extend beyond the 
instant. What more had he 
planned? Gersen called to him. 
Navarth turned aside reluctant- 
ly- 

Gersen asked, “Is Viole Falu- 
she here?” 

“Tish!” exclaimed Navarth. 
“You are a monomaniac!” 

“I have been told as much 
before. Well, is he here?” 

“I have invited twenty-one 
guests. Counting myself, twenty- 
two are present. Viole Falushe 
is here.” 

“Which is he?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“What? You don’t know?” 
Gersen sat upright, aroused 
from his lethargy by Navarth’s 
double-dealing. “We must have 
no misunderstanding, Navarth. 
You accepted a million SVU 
from me, agreeing to fulfill cer- 
tain conditions.” 

“And I have done so,” 
snapped Navarth. “The simple 
truth is that I do not know 
in what semblance Viole Falu- 
she currently walks. I knew the 
boy Vogel Filschner well. Viole 
Falushe has altered his face 
and manner. He might be one 
of three or four. Unless I were 
to unmask this group, send away 
those I recognized until one re- 
mained, I could not give you 
Viole Falushe.”

will act. Be so kind as to sum- 
mon your candidates into the 
pavilion.” 

“No, no!” creaked Navarth. 
“It is impossible. There is an 
easier way. Watch the girl! He 
will go to her. And then you 
will know.” 

“A half-dozen might go to 
her.” 

“Then claim her. Only one 
man would challenge you.” 

“And if no one challenges?” 
Navarth held out his arms. 
“What can you lose?” 

Both turned to look toward 
the girl. Gersen said, “What can 
I lose indeed? What is her rela- 
tionship to you?” 

“She is the daughter of an 
old friend,” declared Navarth 
suavely. “She is, in effect, my 
ward. I have been at pains to 
nurture her and bring her nice- 
ly to maturity.” 

“And this now accomplished, 
you offer her here and there to 
passing strangers?” 

“The conversation becomes 
tiresome,” said Navarth. “Look*. 
A man approaches the girl!” 
Gersen swung around. Possi- 
bility No. 2 had approached 
Zan Zu and was talking in a 


150 


GALAXY 


manner unmistakably ardent. 
Zan Zu listened politely. As in 
the Celestial Harmony Cafe 
Gersen felt a surge of emotion. 
Lust? Jealousy? Protective in- 
stinct? Whatever the nature of 
the urge, it compelled him to 
step forward and join the two. 

“You are enjoying the party?” 
Gersen asked with factitious 
good-fellowship. “A wonderful 
day for such an outing. Navarth 
is a magnificent host; still he 
has introduced me to no one. 
What is your name?” 

Possibility No. 2 answered 
courteously: “Navarth doubtless 
has good reason for the neglect; 
best that we do not divulge our 
identitites.” 

“Sensible,” said Gersen. He 
turned to Zan Zu. “Still, what 
is your opinion?” 

“I have no identity!” 

Possibility No. 2 suggested : 
“Why not approach Navarth 
and inquire his thoughts on the 
subject?” 

“I think not. Navarth would 
become confused. He has pro- 
pounded a fallacy. He seems to 
advocate intimate relationships 
between walking costumes. Is 
this feasible? I doubt it. Cer- 
tainly not at the level of in- 
tensity Navarth would insist 
upon.” 

“Quite so, quite so,” said 
Possibility No. 2. “Be a good 
fellow and leave us to our- 


selves. The young lady and I 
were enjoying a private dis- 
cussion.” 

“My apologies for interrupting 
you. But the young lady and I 
already had planned to gather 
flowers from the meadow.” 
“You are mistaken,” said 
Possibility No. 2. “When all 
wear harlequinade, error is 
easy.” 

“If there has been error, it is 
for the best, as I prefer this 
delightful young flower-picker 
to the last. Be so good as to 
excuse us.” 

possibility No. 2 was amiabili- 
ty itself. “Really, my good 
fellow, your facetiousness has 
run its course. Surely you must 
see that you are intruding?” 

“I think not. In a party of 
this sort, where experience -is to 
be clasped to the naked nerves, 
where Death walks, there is wis- 
dom in flexibility. Notice the 
woman yonder. She appears lo- 
quacious and prepared to dis- 
cuss every subject in your re- 
pertory. Why not join her and 
chat away your heart’s con- 
tent?” 

“But it is you she admires,” 
said Possibility No. 2 brusquely. 
“Be off with you.” 

Gersen turned to Zan Zu. 
“Apparently you must make the 
choice. Conversation or wild- 
flowers?” 


IHE PALACE OF LOVE 


151 


Zan Z u hesitated, looking 
from one to the other. Possibi- 
lity No. 2 fixed her with a gaze 
of burning intensity. “Choose — 
if there indeed is a choice — 
between this lout and myself. 
Choose — but choose carefully.” 

Zan Zu demurely turned to 
Gersen. “Let us pick flowers.” 

Possibility No. 2 stared, look- 
ed away toward Navarth as if 
to call upon him to intercede, 
then thought better of it and 
walked away. 

Zan Zu asked, “Are you real- 
ly anxious to pick wild flow- 
ers?” 

“You know who I am?” 

“Of course.” 

“I don’t care to pick wild 
flowers, unless you do.” 

“Oh . What then do you 
want of me?” 

Gersen found the question 
hard to answer. “I do not know 
myself.” 

Zan Zu took his arm. “Let us 
go to look for flowers, and per- 
haps we will find out.” 

Gersen looked around the 
group. Possibility No. 2 watched 
from a distance. Possibilities No. 
1 and No. 3 appeared to pay 
them no heed. He started off 
through the trees, Zan Zu lean- 
ing on his arm. Gersen put his 
arm around her waist; she 
sighed. 

Possibility No. 2 gave a quick 
jerk of the shoulders and, by 


this motion, seemed to cast off 
restraint. He came after Ger- 
sen with soft portentous strides. 
In his hand he carried a small 
weapon. Behind, so Gersen saw 
in near-instantaneous glimpse, 
stood Navarth, looking after, 
his posture a curious superimpo- 
sition of shame on glee. 

ersen pushed Zan Zu to the 
ground, ducked behind a 
tree. Possibility No. 2 halted. 
He turned toward Zan Zu and, 
to Gersen’s shocked amazement, 
pointed his weapon. 

Gersen leapt from behind the 
tree, struck the man’s arm; the 
weapon threw a sear of energy 
into the ground. The two con- 
fronted each other, eyes blazing. 

There was a shrill blast of 
whistle and from the forest 
come the thud of heavy feet. 
Gendarmes swarmed forth, a 
dozen or more, urged by a 
lieutenant in a golden helmet 
and a furious old man in bro- 
caded gray. 

Navarth stepped forward 
haughtily. “What is the mean- 
ing of this intrusion?” 

The old man, who was short 
and overweight, bounded for- 
ward to shake his fist. “What 
the devil are you up to, tres- 
passing upon my private pro- 
perty? You are a jackanapes! 
And these naked girls — an 
absolute scandal!” 


152 


GALAXY 


In a stem voice Navarth de- 
manded of the lieutenant: “Who 
is this old rogue? What right does 
he have to intrude upon a pri- 
vate party?” 

Now the old man, stepping 
forward, discerned the rug, and 
went pale. “Behold!” he wis- 
pered huskily. “My priceless silk 
Sikkim rug! Spread out for these 
rascals to cavort upon. And my 
chairs, oh my precious Baha- 
durs! What else have they stol- 
en?” 

“This is balderdash!” stormed 
Navarth. “I have rented these 
premises and hired the furniture. 
The owner is Baron Caspar 
Heaulmes, who is at a sanitar- 
ium for his health.” 

“I am Baron Caspar Heaul- 
mes!” cried the old man. “I do 
not know your name, sir, be- 
hind that ridiculous mask, but 
I perceive you to be a black- 
guard! Lieutenant, do your duty. 
Take them all away. I insist on 
the fullest investigation!” 

Navarth threw his hands into 
the air and argued the case from 
a dozen viewpoints, but the lieu- 
tenant was inexorable. “I fear 
I must take all into custody. 
Baron Heaulmes is making a for- 
mal complaint.” 

Gersen, standing to the side, 
had been watching with great in- 
terest, simultaneously noting the 
movements of Possibilities No. 
1, No. 2, No. 3. Whichever was 


Viole Falushe — and it would 
seem to be Possibility No. 2 — 
he would be sweating heavily at 
this moment. Once he were ar- 
rested and taken into court, his 
identity must become known. 

Possibility No. 1 stood dour 
and dismal; Possibility No. 2 
was carefully assessing the situa- 
tion, looking this way and that; 
Possibility No. 3 seemed un- 
concerned, even amused. 

The lieutenant by this time 
had seized Navarth, charging him 
with trespass, theft, offenses 
against public morality and sim- 
ple assault — the last arising 
from his attempt to kick Baron 
Heaulmes. The remaining gen- 
darmes now commenced to herd 
the guests toward a pair of car- 
cel wagons which had descend- 
ed to the meadow. Possibility 
No. 2 loitered at the edge of the 
group and, taking advantage of 
Navarth’s obstreperous behavior, 
slipped behind a tree. Gersen 
raised up a shout; a pair of 
gendarmes looked around, bawl- 
ed peremptory orders and march- 
ed forward to conduct Possibility 
No. 2 to the carcel -wagons. Pos- 
sibility No. 2 jumped back 
among the trees. When the gen- 
darmes ran in pursuit there came 
a dire flash of radiation; once, 
twice, and two men lay dead. 
Possibility No. 2 sprinted away 
through the forest and was lost 
to view. Gersen gave chase, but 


THE PALACE OF LOVE 


153 


halted after a hundred yards, 
fearing ambush. 

Shedding mask, he ran to the 
semi-circular buffet beside the 
pond, where he found and 
donned his cloak. The punt fer- 
ried him across the lake to the 
outskirts of Kussines. 

Five minutes later he reached 
his air-car and took it aloft. He 
hovered several minutes, search- 
ing the air-space. If Possibility 
No. 2 had arrived by air-car, be 
must likewise be taking himself 
aloft. And also, thought Gersen, 
patrol craft would be converging 
on the scene of the murders. One 
man in harlequinade looked much 
like another; the sooner he was 
gone the better. And Gersen flew 
full speed back toward Roling- 
shaven. 

XIII 

/^\n October 3 Navarth, having 
^ paid exemplary damages of 
SVU 50,000 to Baron Caspar 
Heaulmes, was discharged from 
the court, which likewise dis- 
missed charges against Navarth’s 
guests. 

Gersen met Navarth on the 
mall in front of the Justice 
Courts. Navarth at first made 
as if he would pass without 
deigning to recognize Gersen, but 
Gersen finally was able to divert 
him to the table of a nearby 
cafe. 


“Justice, bah!” Navarth made 
a grimace toward the courts. 
“Think of it! Money I must pay 
that vindictive and sanctimonious 
unmentionable! He should have 
indemnified me! Did he not dis- 
rupt the party? What did he 
hope to gain, running forth from 
the forest like that?” Navarth 
paused to moisten his throat 
with the beer Gersen had or- 
dered. “It is enough to turn a 
man sour.” He set the mug down 
with a thump and turned a yel- 
low glance toward Gersen. “What 
do you want of me now? Another 
exercise in bathos? I warn you, 
I will not be so malleable a sec- 
ond time.” 

Gersen displayed the newspa- 
per articles dealing with the 
event. Navarth refused to look 
at them. “A wretched lot of non- 
sense, sheer scurrility. You jour- 
nalists are all alike.” 

“I notice that yesterday a cer- 
tain Ian Kelly was murdered.” 
“Yes, poor Kelly. Did you 
come to the arraignment?” 

“No.” 

“Then you missed your chance, 
because among the crowd was 
Viole Falushe. He is the most 
sensitive of men and cannot for- 
get an injury. Ian Kelly was un- 
lucky enough to resemble you 
in size and manner.” Navarth 
shook his head ruefully. “Ah, 
that Vogel! He detests frustration 
as a bee sting.” 


154

“Do the police know the mur- 
derer is Viole Falushe?” 

“I told them he was a man I 
met in a bar. What else could 
I say?” 

Gersen had no reply to make. 
He indicated the article once 
more. “Twenty names are list- 
ed. Which refers to Zan Zu?” 
Navarth made a contemptuous 
gesture toward the article. “Select 
as you like. One is as accurate as 
the next.” 

“One of these names must 
refer to her,” said Gersen. 
“Which?” 

“How should I know what 
name she chooses to supply the 
police? I believe I will drink 
more beer. The argument has 
parched my throat.” 

“I see here a ‘Drusilla Wayles, 
age 18’. Is this she?” 

“Quite possibly, possibly in- 
deed.” 

“And this is her name?” 
“Merciful Kalizbah! Must she 
own a name? A name is a weight! 
A chain to a set of uncontrolled 
circumstances. To own no name 
is to own freedom! Are you so 
stolid then that you cannot im- 
agine a person without a name? 
She is what one chooses to call 
her.” 

“Strange,” said Gersen. “She 
exactly resembles the Jheral Tin- 
zy of thirty years ago.” 

Navarth jerked back in his 
chair. “How do you know this?” 


“I have not been idle. For 
example, I have produced this.” 
Gersen produced a dummy Cos- 
mopolis. From the cover peered 
the face of young Vogel Filsch- 
ner, superimposed upon the out- 
line of a tall ominous gray fig- 
ure. Below was the caption : THE 
YOUNG VIOLE FALUSHE: 
Vogel Filschner as I knew him 
— Navarth. 

1VT avarth seized the dummy, 
’ read the article aghast. He 
raised his hands to his head. 
“He’ll kill us all! He’ll drown 
us in dog vomit! He’ll grow trees 
in our ears!” 

“The article seems balanced 
and judicious,” said Gersen. 
“Certainly he can take no of- 
fense at facts!” 

Navarth read further and went 
into a new paroxysm of dismay. 
“You have signed my name! I 
never wrote all that!” 

“It’s all true.” 

“The more so! When is this 
to be published?” 

“In a week or two.” 
“Impossible. I forbid it.” 

“In that case, return me the 
money I lent you, that you might 
finance your party.” 

“ ‘Lent’?” Navarth was shock- 
ed anew. “That was no loan! 
You paid me, you hired me to 
produce a party, at which Viole 
Falushe would be present.” 
“You did neither. Baron

Heaulmes, it is true, truncated 
your party, but this is no affair 
of mine. And where was Viole 
Falushe? You can point to the 
murderer, but this means noth- 
ing to me. Please return the 
money.” 

“I cannot! I have spent money 
like water! And Baron Heaulmes 
demanded his pound of flesh.” 

“Well, return to me the nine 
hundred thousand SVU you have 
left.” 

“What? I have no such sum 
on hand!” 

“Perhaps we can set aside a 
portion as your payment for this 
article, but — ” 

“No, no! The article must 
not be published!” 

“Best that we have a com- 
plete understanding,” said Ger- 
sen. “You have not told me all.” 

“For which I am grateful. You 
have published the rest.” Na- 
varth kneaded his forehead. 
“These have been terrible days. 
Have you no pity for poor old 
Navarth?” 

Gersen laughed. “You plotted 
to get me killed. You knew that 
Viole Falushe would attempt to 
possess Drusilla Wayles, or Zan 
Zu, whatever her name. You 
knew that I would not allow it. 
Ian Kelly paid his life in my 
place.” 

“No, no, nothing like that! I 
hoped you would kill Viole Falu- 
she!” 


“You’re a devious villain. What 
of Drusilla, how was she to fare? 
Did you consider her?” 

“I consider nothing,” said Na- 
varth huskily. “I cannot allow 
myself to ponder. If I lifted the 
partition between my two brains 
for so much as an instant . .” 
“Tell me what you know.” 

T T 7"ith extreme reluctance Na- 
* ’ varth obeyed. “I must go 
back to Vogel Filschner once 
more. When he kidnapped the 
choral society, Jheral Tinzy es- 
caped. That you know. But she 
was the cause of the crime, and 
the parents of the other girls 
blamed her. It became very hard, 
very rough. There were threats, 
names called in public. ...” 
Navarth had come under sim- 
ilar attack. One day he proposed 
to Jheral Tinzy that they run 
away together. Jheral, bitter and 
disillusioned, was in a mood for 
anything. They went to Corfu 
where they spent three years, 
and every day Navarth loved 
Jheral Tinzy more ardently than 
the day previously. 

One terrible day Vogel Filsch- 
ner appeared at the door of their 
little villa. He was no longer 
the old Vogel, though his ap- 
pearance was much the same. He 
stood more erect, but the most 
striking change was his new per-, 
sonality. He had become hard, 
sure, firm. His eyes were bright, 


IHE PALACE OF LOVE 


157 


his voice assured. Evil-doing 
clearly was good for him. 

Vogel made a great show of 
amity to Navarth. “Past is past. 
Jheral Tinzy? I want nothing 
from her. She has given herself to 
you; she is sullied. I am fasti- 
dious in this respect; I take no 
woman fresh from another man’s 
use. Be assured, she never will 
know an iota of my love . 
She should have waited. Yes. She 
should have waited, because she 
might have known I would re- 
turn. But now my love for Jheral 
Tinzy is gone.” 

Navarth was somewhat reas- 
sured. He brought out a bottle; 
they sat in the garden, ate 
oranges, drank ouzo. Navarth 
became very drunk and fell 
asleep. When he awoke Vogel 
Filschner was gone. Jheral Tinzy 
was gone as well. 

A day later Vogel Filschner 
reappeared. Navarth was in a 
frenzy. “Where is she? What have 
you done with her?” 

“She is well and safe.” 

“What of your promise? You 
told me you had no more love 
for her!” 

“This is true. The promise 
shall be kept. Jheral will never 
know my love, nor the love of 
any other man. Do you under- 
estimate my emotion, poet? Love 
can turn to hate in a flicker of 
time. Jheral will serve, and serve 
well. She would not gratify my 


love, but she will appease my 
hate.” 

Navarth threw himself at Vo- 
gel Filschner, but Vogel vaulted 
over the wall, and Navarth was 
left alone. 

XIV 

'VTine years later Viole Falushe 
^ made contact with Navarth 
by telescreen, but now his face 
was blanked. Navarth heard only 
his voice. Navarth asked for the 
return of Jheral Tinzy, and Viole 
Falushe agreed. Two days later 
a child three years old was 
brought to Navarth. Viole Falu- 
she called again. “I have done 
as I promised. You have Jheral 
Tinzy again.” 

“Is it her daughter?” 

“It is Jheral Tinzy, this is all 
you need know. I put her into 
your charge. Keep her, nurture 
her, guard her, see that she re- 
mains undefiled — for one day 
I will return for her.” 

The screen went dead. Navarth 
turned to inspect the girl. Even 
now he could see her resem- 
blance to Jheral. What to do? 
Navarth considered the child 
with mingled emotion. He could 
regard her neither as a daugh- 
ter nor as a manifestation of his 
former love. He felt antagonism. 
There would always be a bitter- 
sweet ambiguity in their rela- 
tionship, for Navarth was un- 


158 


GALAXY 


able to love impersonally. The 
object of his love must relate 
to himself. 

Navarth exemplified his con- 
tradicting impulses in his rear- 
ing of the girl. He fed her and 
provided shelter, both of the most 
casual and desultory sort. Other- 
wise the girl was independent. 
She became moody and uncom- 
municative; she made no friends 
and presently gave up asking 
questions. 

As she matured her resembl- 
ance to Jheral Tinzy became 
ever more striking. She was 
Jheral Tinzy indeed, and her 
presence tormented Navarth with 
memories of the past. 

A dozen years passed, but 
Viole Falushe had made no ap- 
pearance. Still Navarth never 
dared hope that Viole Falushe 
had forgotten; indeed he became 
ever more depressed with the 
certainty that Viole Falushe 
would presently arrive and take 
the girl away. He tried from time 
to time to acquaint the girl with 
the danger represented by Viole 
Falushe, but his approach var- 
ied with his mood, and he was 
never sure that she understood 
him. He attempted to seclude 
her, a task rendered difficult by 
the girl’s unpredictable habits, 
and he took her off to remote 
corners of the Earth. 

When the girl was sixteen, 
they lived in Edmonton, Canads, 


the goal of hordes of pilgrims 
who came to gaze upon the Sac- 
red Shin. Navarth reasoned that 
there, among the interminable 
festivals, processions and sacer- 
dotal rites, they might well live 
unnoticed. 

But Navarth was wrong. Viole 
Falushe by some means knew 
his whereabouts! One night the 
telescreen lit up to show a tall 
figure standing against a flash- 
ing blue background which ob- 
scured his features. Navarth 
nevertheless recognized Viole 
Falushe and despondently called 
out “Show” to the telescreen. 

“Well, Navarth,” said Viole 
Falushe. “What do you do in 
the Holy City? Have you be- 
come a devout Kalziban that 
you live almost in the shadow 
of the Shin?” 

“I study,” muttered Navarth. 
“I derive a sense of purpose from 
the pervasive zeal.” 

“And what of the girl? I refer 
to ‘Jheral’. She is well, I trust?” 
“She was in fair condition last 
evening. I haven’t seen her since.” 
Viole Falushe stared fixedly at 
Navarth, with only the glitter 
of his eyes giving dimension to 
his silhouette. “Is she pure?” 
“How would I know?” de- 
manded Navarth crossly. “I can’t 
watch her day and night. In any 
event, what affair is it of yours?” 
If anything, the intensity of 
Viole Falushe’s glance increased. 


IHE PALACE OF LOVE 


159 


“It is my affair in all respects, 
to such a degree as you would 
never imagine!” 

(tXT'our language is extrava- 
* gant,” sniffed Navarth. “I 
can hardly believe you to be 
serious.” 

Viole Falushe laughed softly. 
“Some day you will visit the 
Palace of Love, old Navarth. 
Some day you will be my guest.” 
“Not I!” declared Navarth. “I 
am a new Antaeus; never may I 
detach my toe from Earth. If 
necessary I will fall flat on my 
face and cling with both hands!” 
“Well, then, summon the girl. 
Call ‘Jheral’ before the screen 
so that I may see her.” An odd 
note had entered Viole Falushe’s 
voice: sweetness and tenderness 
burdened with an almost insup- 
portable rage. 

“How can I call her when I 
don’t know her whereabouts? She 
may be prowling the streets, or 
canoeing on the lake, or lying in 
someone’s bed — ” 

A hoarse sound interrupted 
Navarth. But Viole Falushe’s 
voice was mild. “Never say that, 
old Navarth. She was given into 
your care; I intended that you 
give her proper instruction. Have 
you done so? I suspect not.” 
“The best instruction is living 
itself,” declared Navarth bluffly. 
“I am no pedant, as you well 
know.” 


There was a moment’s silence. 
Then Viole Falushe said: “Do 
you know why I put the girl in 
your care?” 

“My own motivations confuse 
me,” said Navarth. “How should 
I know yours?” 

“I will tell you. Because you 
know me well. You know what 
I require without explicit in- 
structions.” 

Navarth blinked. “I had not 
considered the matter in this 
light.” 

“Then, old Navarth, you are 
remiss.” 

“I have heard this accusation 
a hundred times.” 

“But now you know what I 
expect. I hope you will repair 
your neglect.” 

r y'he screen went dead. Navarth 
in a fury of frustration and 
resentment went striding out 
along the Great Nave, that ave- 
nue extending from the Plaza 
of Beatitudes to the Temple of 
the Shin. But the press of pil- 
grims irked him, and he took 
refuge in a teahouse, where he 
drank four cups of strong tea 
before he was sufficiently com- 
posed to think. 

Specifically, Navarth wonder- 
ed, what did Viole Falushe ex- 
pect? He had a romantic in- 
terest in the girl, he wanted her 
inculcated, preconditioned, re- 
ceptive. Navarth could not re- 


160 


GALAXY 


strain a wild cackle of mirth, 
which aroused surprised glances 
from the other patrons of the 
teahouse, most of them black- 
clad pilgrims. 

Viole Falushe wanted him to 
make the girl conscious of the 
great honor which awaited her; 
he wanted her preconditioned, 
predisposed, already fervent. 

The pilgrims, fresh from cere- 
monies at the temple, were re- 
garding him with suspicion. Na- 
vnrth jumped to his feet, de- 
parted the tearoom. There was 
no further reason to remain in 
Edmonton. As soon as possible 
he took the girl back to Rolings- 
haven. 

Once or twice he mentioned 
Viole Falushe to the girl, in a 
tone of dejection, for now he 
had come to think of the girl 
as doomed; to such effect that 
on one occasion the girl ran 
away. Fortuitously the event oc- 
curred immediately before one 
of Viole Falushe’s visits to 
Earth. When he telephoned Na- 
varth demanding to see the girl, 
Navarth was forced to blurt 
forth the truth. Viole Falushe 
spoke in a mild voice: “Best 
that she be found, Navarth.” 

But Navarth made no attempt 
to find the girl until he was 
sure Viole Falushe had departed 
from Earth. 

Here Gersen interposed a 
question: “Could you be sure?” 


Navarth attempted to evade 
the question but finally admit- 
ted that Viole Falushe, during 
his visits to Earth, could be tele- 
phoned at a particular code 
number. “Then you could call 
him now?” 

“Yes, yes, of course,” snapped 
Navarth. “If I wanted to do so, 
which I do not.” He continued 
his story, but now be became 
cautious, using many flamboyant 
gestures, shifting his yellow 
glance all around with only an 
occasional flicker for Gersen. 

It seemed that when Gersen 
appeared on the scene, Navarth 
sensed that here might be a 
weapon to be used against Viole 
Falushe (an aspect to the ac- 
count that Navarth left unspok- 
en). With the utmost caution, 
committing no overt acts, al- 
ways leaving himself lines of 
retreat, Navarth tried to ar- 
range for the discomfiture or 
destruction of Viole Falushe. 
Events however superseded his 
plans. “And now,” quavered Na- 
varth, pointing a long finger at 
the Cosmopolis dummy, “this!” 

“You believe Viole Falushe 
would react unfavorably to the 
article?” 

“Indeed, indeed! He is the 
least forgiving of men; it is the 
key to his soul!” 

“Perhaps then we had best 
discuss the article with Viole 
Falushe himself.”

“What benefit can derive from 
that? He will merely have more 
time to generate a suitable re- 
sponse.” 

z' - '' ersen pondered. “Well, then, 
it seems that we had best 
publish the article in its pres- 
ent form.” 

“No, no!” cried Navarth. 
“Have I not made all clear? He 
would punish us in equivalence 
to his annoyance, and he uses 
a subjective judgment! This 
article would offend him to an 
unprecedented fury; he hates his 
childhood, he only comes to Am- 
beules to gloat and work mis- 
chief on his old enemies. Do 
you know what happened to 
Rudolph Radgo, who jeered at 
Vogel Filschner’s pimples? Ru- 
dolph Radgo’s face is a garden 
of carbuncles, through Sarkoy 
poison. There was Maria, who 
moved her seat because Vogel’s 
rheums and snivelings upset her. 
Maria now lacks all trace of a 
nose. Twice she has had grafts, 
twice she has suffered the loss 
of her new member. She is not 
to have a nose for all her life. 
So you see, it is not wise to of- 
fend Viole Falushe!” Navarth 
craned his neck. “What are you 
wiiting?” 

“This is interesting new ma- 
terial; I am incorporating it into 
the article.” 

Navarth threw his hands up 


so wildly that his chair almost 
overturned. “Have you no prud- 
ence?” 

“Perhaps if we discussed the 
article with Viole Falushe he 
might authorize its publication.” 

“It’s you who are mad, not 
I!” 

“We can only try.” 

“Very well,” croaked Navarth. 
“I have no choice. But I warn 
you, I disavow all connection 
with the article!” 

“As you wish. Shall we make 
our call here, or at the house- 
boat?” 

“At the houseboat.” 

They left the plaza, rode the 
tube to Ambeules, and were con- 
veyed to the Fitlingasse by sur- 
face wagon. 

The houseboat floated serene 
and quiet on the estuary. “Where 
is the girl?” asked Gersen. 
“Zan Zu, Drusilla, whatever her 
name?” 

Navarth refused to answer. 
Gersen’s question, so he im- 
plied, was like asking the color 
of the wind. He hopped on down 
the ladder, jumped aboard the 
boat and, with a desperate, trag- 
ic gesture, flung wide the door. 
He stalked to the telescreen, 
pushed buttons, spoke a muffled 
activant word. The presentation 
sprang to life: a single frail 

lavender flower. Navarth turned. 
“He is available. When he’s off 
Earth the pattern is blue.”

GALAXY 


They waited. From the tele- 
screen came a wisp of tender 
melody, then after a moment or 
two a voice: “Ah, Navarth, my 
ancient companion. With a 
friend?” 

“Yes, an urgent matter. This 
is Mr. Henry Lucas, represent- 
ing Cosmopolis magazine.” 

“A journal with an honored 
tradition! But have we not met? 
There is about you a disturb- 
ing familiarity.” 

“I was on Sarkovy recently,” 
said Gersen. “As I recall, your 
name was in the air.” 

“A miasmic planet, Sarkovy. 
Nevertheless, one with a certain 
macabre beauty.” 

Navarth spoke. “I have had a 
misunderstanding with Mr. Lu- 
cas, and I wish specifically to 
disavow responsibility for his 
actions.” 

“My dear Navarth, you alarm 
me! Mr. Lucas is surely a man 
of courtesy.” 

“You shall see.” 

“As Navarth has mentioned, 
I work for Cosmopolis,” said 
Gersen. “In fact, I am a senior 
official. One of our writers pre- 
pared a rather sensational arti- 
cle. I suspect the writer of over- 
enthusiasm and therefore check- 
ed with Navarth, who reinforced 
my doubts. It seems that the 
writer came upon Navarth in an 
exalted mood and, on the basis 
of a casual word, went to enor- 


mous lengths of research and 
produced the article.” 

“Ah yes, the article. You have 
it with you?” 

Gersen displayed the dummy. 
“It is included here. I insisted 
on checking the facts, apparent- 
ly to good avail. Navarth in- 
sists that our writer- took the 
most extreme liberties. He feels 
that in all fairness you should 
be allowed to authenticate the 
afticle before publication.” 
“Sound notion, Navarth! Well, 
then, allow me to examine this 
alarming effusion. I’m sure it 
can’t be all that grim.” 

XV 

ersen slipped the magazine 
into the transcription rack. 
Viole Falushe read. From time 
to time he made sudden appar- 
ently involuntary noises: hisses 
between the teeth, small throaty 
sounds. “Turn the page, please.” 
His voice was light and mild. 
Presently he said: “Yes, I have 
finished.” There was a moment’s 
silence, then he spoke again, and 
now the voice, superficially joc- 
ular, rang with a tinny over- 
tone. “Navarth, you have been 
singularly reckless, even for an 
exhilarated poet.” 

“Bah,” mutter Navarth. “Did 
I not disassociate myself from 
this entire farrago?” 

“Not completely. I notice 

163 


IHE PALACE OF LOVE 


matters which are magnified and 
distorted in a manner possible 
only to a mad poet. You have 
been indiscreet.” 

Navarth said bravely, “Can- 
dor- is never indiscreet. Truth, 
which is to say, the reflection 
of life, is beautiful.” 

“Beauty is in the eye of the 
beholder,” said Viole Falushe. 
“I for one find little beauty in 
this abusive article. Mr. Lucas 
is quite correct in seeking my 
reaction. The article may not 
be published.” 

For some fantastic reason Na- 
varth saw fit to grumble. “What 
good is notoriety if your friends 
are unable to profit from it?” 

“Exploitation of notoreity and 
humiliation of your friends are 
not identical,” spoke the mild 
voice. “Can you imagine my dis- 
tress if this article appeared and 
exposed me to ridicule? I would 
be forced to demand amends 
from all concerned, which is only 
simple justice. Since by an act 
of yours, my feelings are in- 
jured, then by other acts you 
must atone until my feelings are 
whole again. It is not enough 
to assert that I am over-sensi- 
tive. If you hurt me, then you 
must assuage the hurt, no mat- 
ter how disproportionate the ef- 
fort.” 

“Truth reflects the cosmos,” 
argued the mad poet. “To ex- 
punge truth, one must destroy 


the cosmos. This is the dispro- 
portionate act!” 

“Aha!” declared Viole Falu- 
she. “But the article is not nec- 
essarily truth! It is a point of 
view, an image or two snatched 
out of context. I, the person 
most intimately concerned, de- 
nounce the point of view as a 
flagrant distortion.” 

“I would like to make a sug- 
gestion,” said Gersen. “Why not 
allow Cosmopolin to present the 
real facts; or that is to say, the 
facts from your point of view? 
No doubt you have a statement 
to make to the folk of the Oiku- 
mene, who are fascinated by 
your exploits, whether or not 
they approve of them.” 

UVTo, I think not,” said Viole 

-*■ ' Falushe. “Such an article 
would seem self-inflation or 
worse, a rather spurious apolo- 
gia. Basically I am a modest 
man.” 

“But are you not tn artist 
as well?” 

“Certainly. On the truest and 
noblest scale. Artists before me 
have conveyed their assertions 
by abstract symbology; the spec- 
tators or audience has always 
been passive. I use a more poig- 
nant symbology, essentially ab- 
stract but palpable, visible and 
audible — in short, a symbology 
of events and environments. 
There are no spectators, no 


164 


GALAXY 


audience, no passivity. There 
are only participants. They en- 
counter experience at its keen- 
est. No man has dared con- 
ceive on so vast a scope be- 
fore!” Here Viole Falushe gave 
a slow strange chuckle. “With 
the exception, perhaps of my 
megalomaniac contemporary 
Lens Larque, though his con- 
cepts are less fluid than my own. 
But I dare to say it: I am per- 
haps the supreme artist of his- 
tory. My subject is Life. My 
medium is Experience. My tools 
are Pleasure, Passion, Pungency, 
Pain. I arrange the total envir- 
onment, in order to suffuse the 
total entity. This of course is the 
rationale of my estate, popularly 
known as ‘the Palace of Love’.” 
Gersen nodded sagely. “Pre- 
cisely what the folk of the Oiku- 
mene are anxious to learn! Rath- 
er than publish a vulgar ex- 
pose of this sort — ” Gersen 
tapped the dummy with the 
back of his hand — Cosmopolis 
would like you to explain your 
thesis. We want photographs, 
charts, odor swatches, sound 
impressions, portraits. Above all, 
we want your expert analysis.” 
“Possible, possible.” 

“Good. To this end let us 
meet together. Name a time and 
a place and I will be there.” 
“The place? Where else? The 
Palace of Love. Each year I 
welcome a group of guests. You 


shall be in the current conting- 
ent, and mad old Navarth as 
well.” 

“Not I!” protested Navarth. 
“My feet have never yet lost 
contact with Earth. I do not care 
to risk the clarity of my vis- 
ion.” 

Gersen also demurred. “The 
invitation, though tempting, is 
not particularly convenient. I 
would prefer to meet you to- 
night, here on Earth.” 

“Impossible. On Earth I have 
enemies, on Earth I am a sha- 
dow. No man can point and 
say, ‘There stands Viole Falu- 
she.’ Not even my dear friend 
Navarth, from whom I have 
learned much of value. A lovely 
party, that, Navarth! Magnifi- 
cent, worthy of a mad poet. 
However, I am disappointed in 
the girl I gave you to nurture, 
and I am disappointed in you. 
You have exercised neither the 
tact, the imagination, nor the 
creative direction for which I 
had hoped. Consider the girl, in 
the light of what she is and 
what she might be! I had ex- 
pected a new Jheral Tinzy: gay 
and grave, sweet as honey, tart 
as lime, with a brain full of stars, 
ardent yet innocent. What do 
I find? A wanton, a hoyden, a 
sour-faced ragamuffin, complete- 
ly irresponsible and undiscern- 
ing. Imagine! In preference to 
me, she chose a certain Ian Kel- 


THE PALACE OF LOVE 


165 


ly, an insolent, unworthy per- 
son, far better dead. I find the 
situation incomprehensible. The 
girl clearly has not been well 
trained. Surely she knows of 
me and my interest in her?” 
“Yes,” said Navarth mulishly. 
“I have pronounced your name.” 
“Well, I am not quite satis- 
fied, and I am sending her else- 
where, for corrective training by 
less gifted but more disciplined 
tutors. I think it likely that she 
will join us at the Palace of 
Love. Ah, Navarth? You 
spoke?” 

“Yes,” said Navarth in a dull 
voice. “I have decided to take 
advantage myself of your invita- 
tion. I will visit your Palace of 
Love.” 

“All very well for you artists,” 
said Gersen hurriedly. “But I 
am a busy man. Perhaps a brief 
conference here on Earth — ” 
“But I have already left 
Earth,” said Viole Falushe in 
a voice of gentle reproach. “I 
hang here in orbit only until I 
hear that my plans for the 
young minx have been imple- 
mented. So you must come to 
the Palace of Love.” 

The violet flower flashed 
green, faded and shifted to a 
delicate pale blue. The connec- 
tion had been broken. 

\T avarth sat sprawled in his 
’ chair a long two minutes, 


head askew, chin on his chest. 
Gersen stood looking out the 
window, sensible of a sudden 
new hollowness. 

Navarth lurched to his feet, 
went out on the front deck. Ger- 
sen followed. The sun was set- 
ting into the estuary; the tiled 
roofs of Dourrai glowed bronze; 
the rotting black wharves and 
docks stood forth in queer shapes 
and angles. All was invested 
with an unreal melancholy. 

Gersen presently asked, “Da 
you know how to reach the 
Palace of Love?” 

“No. He will inform us. He 
has a mind like a filing cab- 
inet; no detail evades him.” Na- 
varth swung his arms indecisive- 
ly and then went inside, to re- 
turn with a tall, slender black- 
green bottle and two goblets. He 
broke off the seal and poured. 
“Drink, Henry Lucas, whatever 
your name, whatever your trade. 
Within this bottle is the wis- 
dom of the ages, tincture of 
Earth-gold. Nowhere is tipple to 
equal this; it is unique to old 
Earth. Mad old Earth, like mad 
old Navarth, yields it best in its 
serene maturity. Drink of this 
precious elixir, Henry Lucas, and 
count yourself fortunate. Nor- 
mally it is reserved for mad 
poets, tragic pierrots, black an- 
gels, heroes about to die . .” 

“Cannot I be counted among 
these?” muttered Gersen. 


166 


GALAXY 


As was his habit Navarth 
raised the goblet into the sun- 
light, of which only a few smoky 
orange rays remained. He tossed 
half a cupful into his mouth, 
stared out across the water. “I 
leave Earth. The withered leaf 
is lifted by the wind. Look, 
look, look!” In sudden excite- 
ment he pointed to the somber 
sun-trail along the estuary. “The 
road ahead, the way we must 

go!” 

Gersen sipped the liquor, 
which seemed to explode into 
a spray of multicolored lights. 
“There is no doubt but what he 
has taken the girl?” 

Navarth’s mouth twisted awry. 
“I have no doubt as to this. 
He will punish her, hissing like 
a serpent. She is Jheral Tinzy 
anc once again she has rebuffed 
him ... So once again she 
will return to her infancy.” 

“You are sure she is Jheral 
Tinzy? Not someone who re- 
sembles her closely?” 

“She is Jheral Tinzy. There 
are significant differences, it is 
true. Jheral was frivolous and 
a trifle cruel; this one is somber, 
pensive and never thinks of 
cruelty. But she is Jheral Tinzy.” 
They set, each occupied with 
his own thoughts. Dusk fell 
across the water; lights com- 
menced to shine from the far 
slopes. A uniformed messenger 
alighted from his air-car, des- 


cended the ladder. He called 
from the landing: “A delivery 
for ‘the poet Navarth.’ ” 

Navarth lurched to the gang- 
plank. “I am he.” 

“Thumbprint here, please.” 
Navarth returned with a long 
blue envelope. Slowly he with- 
drew the enclosure. At the top 
was the lavender flower of the 
screen presentation-. The mess- 
age read: - ' 

Go Beyond to Sirneste Clus- 
ter. in Aquarius Sector. Deep 
within the cluster hangs the 
yellow sun Miel. The fifth 
planet is Sogdian, upon which, 
at the south of the hour-glass 
continent, you will discern the 
city Atar. In one month’s time 
go to Rubdan Ulshaziz at his 
agency and say: “I am guest 
to the Margrave.” 

XVI 

VTTith trepidation dampened 
' ' by fatalism, Navarth 
boarded Gersen’s Distis Pha- 
raon. Standing in the saloon, 
looking right and left, he spoke 
in a tragic voice: “So at last it 
has happened! Poor old Na- 
varth, pried away from his 
source of strength! See him now 
— a huddle, a sack of tired 
bones. Navarth! You failed to 
discriminate in your company! 
You befriended wa: % and crim- 
inals and journalists; for your 


THE PALACE OF LOVE 


167 


tolerance you are to be wafted 
away into space.” 

“Compose yourself,” said Ger- 
sen. “It’s not all that bad.” 
As the Pharaon lifted from 
Earth Navarth gave a hollow 
groan, as if a spike were being 
driven into his foot. 

“Look out the port,” sug- 
gested Gersen. “See old Earth 
as you have never seen it be- 
fore.” 

Navarth inspected the great 
blue and white globe and re- 
luctantly agreed that the vista 
was of majestic dimension. 

“Now Earth recedes,” said 
Gersen. “We point ourselves to- 
ward Aquarius, we engage the 
intersplit. Suddenly we are in- 
sulated from the universe.” 
Navarth pulled at his long 
chin. “Strange,” he admitted. 
“Strange that this shell can con- 
vey us so far so fast. Some- 
where there is mystery. It im- 
pels one to theosophy: to the 
worship of a space-god, or a 
god of light.” 

“Theory dissolves the mys- 
tery, though it lays bare a cryp- 
tic new stratum. Quite likely 
there is an endless set of these 
layers, mystery below mystery. 
Space is foam, matter particles 
are nodes and condensations. The 
foam fluxes, at varying rates. 
The average activity of these 
minuscles fluxes is Time.” 
Navarth cautiously moved 


across the ship. “It is all very 
interesting. Had I followed an 
early bent, I might have been 
a great scientist.” 

The voyage proceeded. Na- 
varth was a rather trying com- 
panion, ebullient one moment, 
morose the next. At one time he 
simultaneously became afflicted 
with claustrophobia and agora- 
phobia and lay on a settee with 
his feet bare and a cloth pulled 
over his head. On other occa- 
sions he sat by the port watch- 
ing the stars pass, crowing with 
amazement and glee. Another 
time he became interested in the 
working of the intersplit, and 
Gersen explained it as well as 
he could: “Space-foam is whorl- 
ed into a spindle. The pointed 
ends crack and split the foam, 
which has no inertia. The ship, 
inside the whorl, is insulated 
from the effects of the universe; 
the slightest force propels it at 
an unthinkable rate. Light curls 
through the whorl, so we have 
the illusion of seeing the pass- 
ing universe.” 

“Hmm,” mused Navarth. 
“How small can the units be 
made?” 

Gersen knew no definite an- 
swer. “Quite compact, I suppose.” 

“Think! If you carried one 
on your back you would be- 
come invisible!” 

“To drift a million miles with 
each breath.” 


168 


GALAXY 


“Unless a person anchored 
himself. Why isn’t this done?” 
“The intersplit would break 
the connection; no anchor would 
hold.” 

]VTavarth argued the point at 
' length and lamented his 
previous ignorance. “Had I 
known previously of this marvel- 
ous device, I might have con- 
trived a useful new machine!” 
“The intersplit has been 
known for a long time.” 

“But not to me!” And Na- 
varth went off to brood. 

Through the hither stars of 
Aquarius flew the Pharaon. The 
Pale, that invisible barrier 
theoretically separating order 
from chaos, fell behind. Ahead 
glowed Simeste Cluster, two 
hundred stars like a swarm of 
bright bees, controlling planets 
of every size and description. 
Gersen located Miel with some 
difficulty, and presently the fifth 
planet Sogdian hung below, of 
Earth-size and atmospheric type, 
like most of the settled planets. 
The climate appeared temper- 
ate; the polar ice was of small 
extent; the equatorial zone 
showed expanses of desert and 
jungle. The hour-glass contin- 
ent was evident at once, and the 
macroscope located the city of 
Atar. 

Gersen sent down a request 
for landing clearance. It re- 


ceived no acknowledgment, 
which Gersen. took as a sign that 
landing formalities were un- 
known. 

He settled towards the planet, 
and Atar spread below: a small 
pink and white city surround- 
ing an inlet of the ocean. The 
space port was operated in the 
manner standard at all the outer 
worlds : as soon- as Gersen had 
landed, two port officials ap- 
proached, exacted a fee and de- 
parted. There were no de- 
weaselers, a sign that the world 
was not a haven for pirates, 
raiders and slavers. 

No public conveyance was 
available, so Gersen and Na- 
varth walked a half-mile to the 
town. The people of Atar, dark- 
skinned folk, with hair dyed 
orange, wearing white pantaloons 
and wide complicated white 
turbans, regarded them with 
great curiosity. They spoke an 
incomprehensible language, but 
Gersen by dint of repeating, 
“Rubdan Ulshaziz? Rubdan Ul- 
shaziz?” presently learned the 
whereabouts of the man he 
sought. 

Rubdan Ulshaziz operated an 
import and export agency near 
the ocean. He was a bland, 
dark-skinned man dressed like 
the others in loose pantaloons 
and turban. “Gentlemen, 1 wel- 
come you. Will you drink 
punch?” He poured out tiny cup- 


THE PALACE OF LOVE 


169 


lets of thick cold fruit syrup. 

“Thank you,” said Gersen. 
“We are guests of the Margrave 
and were instructed to come to 
you.” 

tC^vf course, of course!” Rub- 
dan Ulshaziz bowed. “You 
will now be conveyed to the 
planet where the Margrave has 
his little estate.” Rubdan Ul- 
shaziz favored them with a 
lewd wink. “Excuse me a little 
moment; I will instruct the per- 
son who is to conduct you.” He 
disappeared behind a portiere, 
presently to return with a dour- 
seeming man with close-set eyes 
who puffed nervous clouds of 
smoke from an acrid cheroot. 
Rubdan Ulshaziz said, “This is 
Zog, who will escort you to 
Rosja.” 

Zog blinked, coughed, spat a 
shred of tobacco to the floor. 

“He speaks only the language 
of Atar,” continued Rubdan Ul- 
shaziz. “He will not be able 
to offer a description of your 
destination. Are you ready?” 

“I need equipment from my 
spaceboat,” said Gersen. “And 
the spaceboat itself, is it safe?” 
“As safe as if it were a tree. 
I will go bond on this. If you 
do not find all correct upon 
your return, seek out Rubdal 
Ulshaziz and demand an ac- 
counting. But what do you wish 
from your ship? The Margrave 
570 


furnishes everything, even to 
new garments.” 

“I need my recorder,” said 
Gersen. “I plan to take photo- 
graphs.” 

Rubdal Ulshaziz made a suave 
gesture. “The Margrave sup- 
plies all equipment of this sort, 
the most modern cominbations. 
He wants his guests to arrive un- 
burdened by possessions, though 
he is indifferent to their psychic 
baggage.” 

“In other words,” said Ger- 
sen, “we are not to carry any 
personal belongings with us?” 

“None whatever. The Mar- 
grave supplies everything. His 
hospitality is all-inclusive. You 
have locked, sealed and coded 
your spaceship? Good! Then 
from this moment forward you 
are a guest of the Margrave. If 
yiu will occompany Fendi Zog 
. ” He signaled Zog with a 
peremptory twist of the hand; 
Zog inclined his head; Gersen 
and Navarth followed him to an 
open area behind the warehouse. 
Here was an air-car of a de- 
sign unfamiliar to Gersen and, 
so it seemed, to Zog as well. 
Sitting at the controls, Zog test- 
ed first one operator then an- 
other, squinting at the rather 
haphazard arrangement of 
knobs, grips and voice sensors. 
Finally, as if tiring of the un- 
certainty, he pushed at a clus- 
ter of finger-flicks. The air-car 

GALAXY 


jerked aloft, darted across the 
tree-tops, with Zog crouched at 
the controls and Navarth call- 
ing out in wrath. 

Zog finally took command of 
the air-car; they flew twenty 
miles south across the cultivated 
plots and stock-pens surround- 
ing Atar, to a field on which 
rested a late-model Baumur 
Andromeda. Once again Zog 
betrayed signs of uncertainty. 
The air-car swooped, bucked, 
wallowed, finally sank to rest; 
Navarth and Gersen alighted 
with alacrity. Zog signaled them 
toward the Andromeda; they 
climbed aboard, and the port 
closed behind them. Through a 
transparent panel in the parti- 
tion separating saloon from the 
forward compartment, they saw 
Zog settling himself at the con- 
trols. Navarth called out an in- 
stant protest; Zoz squinted back 
through the panel, bared yellow 
teeth in what might have been 
meant as a smile of reassurance 
and drew a curtain. The mag- 
netic lock clicked shut on the 
intervening door. Navarth sank 
back in dismay. “Life is never 
so sweet until it becomes a 
hazard. What a sour trick for 
Vogel to play on his old precep- 
tor!” 

Gersen indicated the pleated 
burlap screen which covered the 
ports. “He also wants to pre- 
serve his mystery.” 


Navarth shook his head in 
bewilderment. “What use is 
knowledge to minds benumbed 
by fright? Why do we wait? 
Does Zog consult the Operator’s 
Manual?” 

''T~'he Andromeda lurched and 
' rose at an, alarming rate, 
almost hurling -Gersen and Na-_ 
varth to the floor, and Gersen 
grinned to hear Navarth’s roar 
of protest. The sun Miel, as it 
could be glimpsed through the 
burlap, swung right and left, 
then rolled down and out of 
sight below the hull. Off through 
the cluster flew the Andromeda, 
and it seemed as if Zog changed 
course several times, whether 
from inaccuracy, poor spaceman- 
ship or a desire to confuse his 
passengers. 

Two hours passed. A yellow- 
white sun bulked large behind 
the screened ports. Below hung 
a planet the configuration of 
which could not be discerned 
by reason of the curtain. With 
an impatient ejaculation, Na- 
varth went to pull the curtain 
aside. A crackle of blue sparks 
struck out at his fingertips; Na- 
varth fell back with a startled 
cry. “This is an imposition!” he 
exclaimed. “Ill usage indeed!” 

From an unseen diaphragm 
a recorded voice spoke: “As 

cherished guests, you will wish 
to please your host .by adhering 


THE PALACE OF LOVE

to certain standards of courtesy 
and restraint It is not necessary 
to define these standards; they 
will be clear to all persons of 
delicacy. The stimulus provides 
a jocular reminder to the in- 
sensitive or thoughtless.” 

Navarth made a surly sound 
in his throat. “There’s a smug 
dog for you. What harm in 
peering forth from the port?” 

“Evidently the Margrave hopes 
to conceal the location of his 
headquarters,” said Gersen. 

“Balderdash. What is to pre- 
vent a man searching the clus- 
ter until he finds the Palace 
of Love?” 

“There are hundreds of plan- 
ets,” Gersen pointed out. “Very 
likely other discouragements as 
well.” 

“He need fear no intrusion 
from me,” sniffed Navarth. 

The Andromeda settled upon 
a field surrounded by blue- 
green gum trees, of distinctly 
terrestrial derivation. Zog imme- 
diately unsealed the port, a pro- 
cess which Gersen watched first 
with amazement, then quizzical 
amusement. Wary of unseen mi- 
crophones, he communicated 
none of his ideas to Navarth.

and radiance. The air was pun- 
gent with the odor of the gum 
trees and native vegetation; 
shrubs with lustrous black stalks, 
black and scarlet leaf-disks; 
blue spikes with fluttering dark 
blue vanes, puffs of cottony 
membrane enclosing tomato- 
red nodes. There were also 
clumps of terrestrial bamboo and 
grass and a thicket of black- 
berry bushes. 

“Bizarre, bizarre,” muttered 
Navarth, looking about. “There 
is fascination to be found on 
these far worlds!” 

“This is almost like Earth,” 
said Gersen. “But other areas 
may be dominated by local 
plants; then you will see the 
truly bizarre.” 

“No scope even for a sane 
poet,” grumbled Navarth. “But 
I must put aside my individuali- 
ty, my pitiful small cell of sen- 
tience. I have been snatched 
from Earth, and no doubt my 
bones will root in this strange 
soil.” He picked up a clod, 
crushed it between his fingers, 
let the fragments fall to the 
ground. “It looks like soil, it 
feels like soil — but it is star- 
stuff. We are far from Earth. 
What? And we are to be ma- 
rooned as well, with neither a 
crust nor a bottle of wine?” For 
Zog had returned within the 
Andromeda and was sealing the 
port. Gersen took Navarth’s arm. 


GALAXY 



hustled him across the meadow. 
“Zog has a reckless tempera- 
ment; he may take off on inter- 
split and carry away ship, mea- 
dow, shrubs, grass and two pass- 
engers, if we stand too near. 
Then you could well sing of 
bizarre circumstances.” 

But Zog raised the ship on 
its ionic pencils; Gersen and 
Navarth watched it dwindle into 
the bright, blue sky. “So here 
we are, somewhere in Sirneste 
Cluster,” said Navarth. “Either 
the Palace of Love is nearby or 
Viole Falushe has performed 
another of his grotesque jokes.” 

Gersen went to the edge of 
the meadow, looked through the 
screen of trees. “Grotesque joke 
or not, here is a road. It must 
lead somewhere.” 

They set out along the road, 
between hedges of tall black 
rods with scarlet leaf disks clat- 
tering and chattering in the 
wind. The road wound around 
a knob of black schist, swung 
up a steep rise; gaining the crest 
they looked out upon a valley 
and a small city only a mile 
or two distant. 

“Is this the Palace of Love?” 
wondered Navarth. “Hardly 
what I had expected: far too 
neat, too precise. And what are 
those circular towers?” The tow- 
ers to which Navarth referred 
rose at regular intervals across 
the city. Gersen could only sug- 


gest that they contained offices 
or apartments, or perhaps serv- 
ed to house civic functionaries. 

A s they started down the hill, 
a vehicle approached at a 
great rate: a bumping thudding 
platform supported by rolling 
air-cushions. Standing at the 
controls was a gaunt, stern per- 
son in a brown and black uni- 
form, who on closer inspection 
proved to be a woman. She halt- 
ed the car and inspected the 
two with a skeptical gaze. “You 
are the Margrave’s guests? Step 
aboard, then.” 

Navarth took exception to the 
woman’s tone. “Were you sup- 
posed to meet the ship? This is 
inefficiency; we were forced to 
walk!” 

The woman gave him a scorn- 
ful half-smile. “Get aboard, un- 
less you care to walk more.” 
Gersen and Navarth climbed 
aboard, Navarth fuming with 
indignation. Gersen asked the 
woman, “What city is that?” 

“It is City Ten.” 

“And what is your name for 
this planet?” 

“I call it Fool’s-World. Other 
folk may call it what they like.” 
Her mouth snapped shut like 
a trap. She swung the vehicle 
around and started back down 
the road, the bladders pound- 
ing, Gersen and Navarth cling- 
ing tight to avoid being hurled 


174 


GALAXY 


into the ditch. Navarth bawled 
orders and instructions, but the 
woman drove even more furious- 
ly and did not slow until they 
entered the city by a curving, 
tree-shaded avenue; whereupon 
her pace became extremely se- 
date, and Gersen and Navarth 
were exposed to the curious 
stares of the city’s inhabitants. 

These were a people without 
distinctive peculiarity, other 
than the fact that the heads 
of the men were shaved clean 
as an egg, eyebrows, scalp, and 
beard; while the women affect- 
ed an elaborate coiffure of long 
varnished spikes, occasionally 
tipped with flowers or other or- 
naments. Both men and women 
wore garments of extravagant 
cut and color and carried them- 
selves with a peculiar mixture 
of swagger and furtiveness; 
speaking emphatically in low 
voices, laughing in loud brash 
bays, only to stop short, look 
in all directions, then continue 
with their mirth. 

The vehicle passed one of the 
towers Navarth had noted: a 
structure of twenty stories, each 
apparently consisting of six 
wedge-shaped apartments. 

Navarth spoke to the woman: 
“What is the purpose of the 
towers which rise so prominent- 
ly?” 

“It is where the taxes are 
collected,” was the reply. 


“Aha then, Henry Lucas, you 
are correct. The towers house 
civic functionaries.” 

The woman turned Navarth a 
gray glance. “They do, indeed. 
Indeed and indeed.” 

Navarth paid her no further 
heed. He pointed to one of the 
numerous cafes along the boule- 
vard, patronized principally by 
men. “These rascals have much 
idle time,” Navarth noted. “See 
how they loll and take their tip- 
ple! Viole Falushe is less than 
harsh with his subjects, if such 
they be!” 

/ T'he vehicle swung into a tum- 
1 around, halted before a 
long two-floored building. On 
the verandah sat a number of 
men and women in various cos- 
tumes, obviously outworlders. 
“Off then, shag-heads!” said the 
woman driver tersely. “Here is 
the inn; I have done my stint.” 
“Incompetently, and in a sur- 
ly manner,” declared Navarth, 
rising and preparing to alight. 
“Your own head, incidentally, 
would never be the worse for 
a few changes. Perhaps a full 
beard, as a start.” 

The woman touched a but- 
ton; the bed of the vehicle tilt- 
ed; Navarth and Gersen were 
forced to jump to the ground. 
The vehicle departed, with Na- 
varth making an insulting ges- 
ture at the woman’s back. 


THE PALACE OF LOVE 


175 


A footman came forward to 
meet them. “You are guests of 
the Margrave?” 

“This is correct,” said Na- 
varth. “We have been invited to 
the Palace.” 

“During the wait, you will be 
housed at the inn.” 

“Wait? Of what duration?” 
demanded Navarth. “I assumed 
that we would be taken directly 
to the Palace.” 

The footman bowed. “The 
Margrave’s guests assemble here; 
all go forth together. I presume 
there are five or six others yet 
to come, this being the usual 
number. May I show you to 
your rooms?” 

Gersen and Navarth were con- 
ducted to cubicles eight feet 
on a side, each containing a low 
narrow bunk, a wardrobe, a lav- 
atory, ventilated only by the lat- 
tice in the door. Navarth was 
housed next to Gersen, and his 
complaints were clearly audible. 
Gersen smiled to himself. For 
reasons known best to himself, 
such was the style in which 
Viole Falushe wished his guests 
to wait. 

Within the wardrobe were 
Earth-style garments of a light 
crisp fabric. Gersen washed, re- 
moved his beard with a depila- 
tory, changed into fresh gar- 
ments and went out upon the 
verandah. Navarth had preced- 
ed him and already was holding 


forth to the eight people, four 
men and four women, who sat 
there. 

Gersen took a seat to the side 
and considered the group. Be- 
side him sat a portly gentleman 
wearing the black neck band 
and beige skin tone currently 
fashionable on the Mechanics 
Coast of Lyonesse, one of the 
Concourse planets. He was, so 
Gersen discovered, a manufac- 
turer of bathroom fixtures nam- 
ed Hygen Grote. His companion, 
Doranie, almost certainly not his 
wife, was a cool, wide-eyed 
blonde woman with only an ul- 
trafashionable hint of bronze 
skin luster. 

A pair of serious young women 
sat quietly to the side: so- 
ciology students at Sea Provi- 
dence University near Avente. 
Their names were Tralla Cal- 
lob and Momice Whill; they 
seemed awed, half alarmed and 
sat close to each other, feet flat 
on the floor, knees pressed tight 
together. Tralla Callob was not 
unattractive, though she seem- 
ed unaware of this and took no 
pains to make the most of her- 
self. Momice Whill was vic- 
timized by over-large features 
and a truculent conviction that 
every man in the group intend- 
ed assault upon her chastity. 

More relaxed was Margray 
Liever, a middle-aged woman 


176 


GALAXY 


from Earth who had won first 
prize in a television contest: her 
‘heart’s desire.’ She had chosen 
a visit to Viole Falushe’s ‘Palace 
of Love’. Viole Falushe had 
been amused and obliging. 

Torrace daNossa was a musi- 
cian, a man of sophistication 
and elegance, perhaps a trifle 
soft, more than a trifle vain, 
with an effortless ease of man- 
ner which made meaningful con- 
versation difficult. He was visit- 
ing the Palace of Love prepara- 
tory to composing an opera en- 
titled The Palace of Love. 

Lerand Wible was a marine 
architect of Earth, who re- 
cently had constructed a sailboat 
of ultimate design. The fin was 
osmium, the sails were tall air 
foils of metal-plated foam, self- 
supporting and unstayed. Sails 
and fin extended at opposite 
diameters of a metal slip-ring; 
the hull floated upright, in its 
most efficient hydro dynamic 
posture. Both hull and fin were 
coated with a water-repellent, 
reducing skin friction to a min- 
imum, while ducts expelled air 
to minimize turbulence. Wible 
had met Viole Falushe in con- 
nection with his fanciful scheme 
for a sea-going palace, ring- 
shaped to enclose a central la- 
goon. 

Skebou Diffiani was a taciturn 
man with a head of coarse black 
hair, a black, tightly curled 


beard, an expression conveying 
disdain and suspicion of all the 
others. He was a native of Quan- 
tique, which went far to explain 
his aloof manner. His occupa- 
tion was day-laborer. His inclu- 
sion in the group could be ex- 
plained only as a caprice of 
Viole Falushe. 

Margray Liever had been the 
first to arrive, five of the long 
local days before. Then Tralla 
and Momice had come, then Ske- 
bou Diffiani. Lerand Wible and 
Torrace daNossa were next, fol- 
lowed by Hygen Grote and Dor- 
anie. 

Navarth plied all with ques- 
tions, pacing the verandah, dart- 
ing side-glances right and left. 
But no one knew more than he 
did; none knew where lay the 
Palace of Love or the time of 
departure. The uncertainty trou- 
bled no one. In spite of the con- 
stricted chambers, the hotel was 
reasonably comfortable, and 
there was the city to be explored: 
a puzzling, mysterious city, with 
latencies and undercurrents some 
of the guests found fascinating, 
others disturbing. 

A gong summoned the group 
to lunch, which was served on 
a back court under black, green 
and scarlet trees. The cuisine was 
uncomplicated : pastry wafers, 

poached fish, fruit, a cool pale 
green beverage, cakes of spiced 
currants. During the meal six 

177 


THE PALACE OF LOVE 


new guests arrived and were 
brought immediately to the court 
for lunch. They were Druids of 
Vale, or Virgo 912 VII, and ap- 
parently consisted of two fami- 
lies, though such relationships 
were shrouded in secrecy. There 
were two Druids, two Druidess- 
es, two adolescents. All wore sim- 
ilar garments: black gowns, black 
cowls, long-toed black slippers. 
Druids Dakaw and Pruitt were 
tall and saturnine; Druidess Wust 
was thin, sinewy, with a hollow - 
cheeked face, Druidess Laidig 
was portly and imposing. The lad 
Hule was sixteen or seventeen, 
extremely handsome, with sal- 
low clear skin and dark eyes. He 
spoke little and smiled never, sur- 
veying all with a troubled gaze. 
The girl Billika, about the same 
age, was likewise pale, with 
something of the same troubled 
gaze, as if she constantly strove 
to balance sets of irreconcilable 
relationships. 

nphe Druids sat together, ate 
hurriedly with cowls drawn 
forward and only occasional 
mutters of conversation. After 
lunch, when the guests returned 
to the verandah, the Druids came 
purposefully forward, introduced 
themselves with brave cordiality 
and took seats among the others. 

Navarth came to question 
them, but their evasiveness was a 
match for his curiosity, and he 


learned nothing. The talk be- 
came general, reverting, as it al- 
ways did, to the city, the name 
of which was either City Ten or 
Kouliha. The subject of the tow- 
ers arose. What was their func- 
tion? Did they contain business 
offices, as Doranie suggested, or 
were they residences? Navarth 
reported the explanation of the 
woman in the uniform — that the 
towers were tax-gathering agen- 
cies — but the rest of the group 
found the idea far fetched. Dif- 
fiani made the somewhat brutal 
assertion that the towers were 
brothels: “Notice! Early in the 
morning girls and young women 
arrive; later the men come!” 

Torrace daNossa said, “The 
hypothesis is one which leaps to 
mind, but the women leave when 
they will. And they seem to in- 
clude every stratum of society, 
which is hardly typical.” 

Hygen Grote gave a sly wink 
to Navarth. “There is a simple 
way to resolve the question. I 
suggest that we deputize one of 
our number to make direct in- 
quiry.” 

Druidesses Laidig and Wust 
snorted and drew their cowls 
close around their faces; the girl 
Billika licked her lips nervously. 
Druids Dakaw and Pruitt looked 
off in different directions. Ger- 
sen wondered why the Druids, 
notoriously prim, had ventured 
on the journey to the Palace of 


178 


GALAXY 


Love, when their sensibilities 
could not but fail to be out- 
raged. Mysteries everywhere . 

A few minutes later Gersen 
and Navarth went for a stroll 
through the city, examining stalls, 
stores, workshops and residences 
with the untroubled curiosity of 
tourists. The people watched 
them with indifference and per- 
haps a tinge of envy. They seem- 
ed prosperous, gentle, easy of 
disposition. Still Gersen sensed 
a pervading quality he could not 
define. Nothing so coarse as fear, 
or discord, or anxiety. ... A 
wide tree-shaded cafe tempted 
Navarth; Gersen pointed out that 
they lacked money. 

Navarth brushed the matter 
aside and insisted that Gersen 
join him for a glass of wine. Ger- 
sen shrugged, followed Navarth 
to a table. Navarth signaled the 
proprietor. “We are guests of 
the Margrave Viole Falushe; we 
have no coin of the city. We in- 
tend to patronize your cafe, and 
you may send the account to the 
hotel for collection.” 


The proprietor bowed puncti- 
liously. “It shall be as you wish.” 

“Then we will drink a flask of 
whatever wine you consider suit- 
able for this time of day.” 

“At once, sir.” 

The wine was served, a pleas- 
ant beverage which Navarth 
found somewhat too delicate. 
They sat watching folk walk 
past. Directly opposite rose one 
of the cryptic towers, which now, 
in the middle afternoon, showed 
no great activity. 

Navarth summoned the pro- 
prietor to order another flask 
of wine and, indicating the tow- 
er, asked, “what goes on in yon- 
der tower?” 

The proprietor seemed puzzled 
by the question. “It is like all 
the rest. Where we pay our tax- 
es.” 

“But why so many towers? 
Would not a single tower suf- 
fice?” 

Now the proprietor was amaz- 
ed. “What, sir? For so many peo- 
ple as live here? Hardly possi- 
ble!”

With this Navarth was forced 
to be satisfied. 

Returning to the hotel they 
found that two more guests had 
arrived, both men of Earth: Har- 
ry Tanzel of London, Gian Mario 
of no fixed address. Both were 
well favored men, tall, keen- 
faced, dark-haired, of ages not 
immediately apparent. Tanzel 
was perhaps the handsomer of 
the two; Mario was more ener- 
getic and vital. 

The local day was a long 
twenty-nine hours. When night 
finally arrived the guests retired 
without protest to their cubicles, 
only to be awakened at midnight 
by a gong and summoned to a 
midnight meal. 

XIX 

^p'he following morning saw the 
arrival of Zuly, a tall lang- 
orous dancer from the world Val- 
halla, Tau Gemini VI. She com- 
ported herself with the most ex- 
quisite mannerisms, to the sus- 
picion and perturbation of the 
Druids, especially young Hule 
who could not keep his eyes 
away from the woman. 

Immediately after the morn- 
ing meal Gersen, Navarth and 
Lerand Wible went walking be- 
side the canal which ran behind 
the hotel. Today appeared to be 
a holiday. The people of the city 
wore garlands. Some were drunk; 


others sang songs in praise of 
Arodin, evidently a folk-hero or 
ruler. 

“Even on a holiday,” said Na- 
varth, “they go to pay their 
taxes.” 

“Nonsense,” said Wible. “When 
do men go to pay taxes with so 
jaunty a step?” The three paused 
to watch men going and coming 
from the tall tower. “Definitely, 
it is a brothel. It can be noth- 
ing else.” 

“But so public. So industri- 
ous? We may be misled by ap- 
pearances.” 

“Conceivably. Do you wish 
to enter the place?” 

“No, indeed! If brothel it is, 
I am unfamiliar with their meth- 
ods and might perform some 
unorthodox act, to the discredit 
of us all.” 

“You are unusually cautious.” 

“I am on a strange planet,” 
sighed Navarth. “I lack the 
strength I derive from the soil 
of old Earth. But I am curious; 
we shall resolve the question 
once and for all. Come.” He led 
the way to the pavilion, where 
they had been served the day 
before, and scanned the tables. 
A portly middle-aged gentleman 
in a wide-brimmed, green hat sat 
looking off along the boulevard, 
a small jug of wine at his elbow. 

Navarth approached him. 
“Your pardon, sir. As you can 
see, we are strangers here. One 


180 


GALAXY 


cr two of your customs puzzle us, 
and we wish to leam how mat- 
ters stand.” 

The middle-aged man heaved 
himself erect and after a mom- 
ent’s hesitation pointed to the 
other chairs. “I will explain as 
best I can, though there is small 
mystery here. We do as best 
we can and live according to our 
lights.” 

Navarth, Gersen and Wible 
seated themselves. “First of all,” 
Navarth inquired, “what is the 
function of that tower yonder, 
where so many people go in and 
out?” 

“Ah, there. Yes. That is our 
local agency of tax collection.” 

“Tax collection?” asked Na- 
varth, with a triumphant glance 
at Wible. “And the folk who go 
in and out pay taxes?” 

“Exactly. The city is under the 
wise sponsorship of Arodin. We 
are prosperous because taxes 
suck away none of our wealth.” 

i 

\ t this Lerand Wible made a 
skeptical sound. “How is this 
possible?” 

“Is it not the same elsewhere? 
The money collected is the mon- 
ey which otherwise would be 
spent on frivolity. The system is 
beneficient to all. Every girl of 
the region must serve five years, 
performing a stipulated number 
of services per day. Naturally 
the more attractive girls fulfill 


their quota sooner than those 
who are plain, and there is con- 
sequently a considerable incen- 
tive to maintaining pulchritude.” 
“Aho!” said Wible. “A civic 
brothel!” 

His informant shrugged. “Call 
it what you wish. There is no 
diminution of resource; the yield 
is devoted to civic expense; there 
is no outcry atjthe collection of 
tax, and the tax collectors find 
their work not irksome; or if they 
do, they can make in-lieu pay- 
ments — which usually happens 
should the girl wed before her 
service is complete. Then, of 
course, we have our obligation 
to Arodin, which each of us dis- 
charges by the payment of a 
two-year-old child. Thereupon 
we pay no more taxes, except for 
an occasional special assessment.” 
“No one complains when their 
child is taken?” 

“Usually not. The child is tak- 
en to a creche immediately after 
birth, so that no bonds of affec- 
tion are formed. Folk breed chil- 
dren early to discharge their ob- 
ligation as rapidly as possible.” 
Wible exchanged glances with 
Navarth and Gersen. “And what 
happens to the children?” 

“They go to the account of 
Arodin. The unsuitables are sold 
to the Mahrab; the satisfactory 
serve at the great Palace. I gave 
a child ten years ago; I now owe 
tax to no one.” 


THE PALACE OF LOVE 


181 


TV T avarth could contain him- 
' self no longer. Leaning for- 
ward in his chair he pointed a 
knobby finger. “So this is why 
you sit here blinking so smugly 
in the sun? Where is your guilt?” 
“ ‘Guilt’?” The man raised his 
hands to adjust his wire-brimmed 
hat in puzzlement. “There is no 
guilt. I have performed my duty. 
I gave my child; I patronize the 
civic brothel twice a week. I am 
a free man.” 

“While the child you gave is 
now a ten-year-old slave. Some- 
where he, or she, toils that you 
may sit here with your belly on 
your lap!” 

The man rose to his feet, face 
pink with fury. “This is incite- 
ment, a serious offense! What 
then do you do here, you plucked, 
foolish old fowl? Why do you 
come to this city if you don’t 
fancy our ways?” 

“I did not select your city as 
a destination,” said Navarth with 
dignity. “I am a guest to Viole 
Falushe and remain here only 
pending his notification.” 

The man laughed: a harsh 
throbbing chortle. “This is the 
outworld name for Arodin. You 
come to the Palace, and you have 
not even paid!” He pounded the 
table once with his fist and 
marched out of the cafe. Other 
patrons who had been listening 
pointedly turned their backs. 


Presently the three returned to 
the hotel. 

Even as they arrived the thud 
of the bladder-buggy sounded at 
the end of the boulevard. It 
rumbled up to the hotel, halted. 
A man alighted, turned to help 
down a young woman who, ignor- 
ing the hand, jumped to the 
ground. Navarth gave a raucous 
cry of surprise. The young wom- 
an, attired in fashionable Alpha- 
nor-style garments, was Na- 
varth’s erstwhile ward, known 
as Zan Zu, Drusilla and other- 
wise. 

Navarth took her aside, pelted 
her with questions: what had 
happened to her; where had she 
been pent? 

Drusilla could tell him little. 
She had been shoved into an air- 
car by the white-eyed man, con- 
veyed to a space-vessel, placed 
in the custody of three grim 
women. Each of them wore a 
heavy gold' ring. After the poison 
sprayed from the rings was dem- 
onstrated upon a dog, no further 
threats or warnings were neces- 
sary. 

D rusilla was taken to Avente 
on Alphanor, lodged at the 
splendid Hotel Tarquin. The 
women were watchful as hawks, 
speaking seldom, never more 
than two or three feet away, the 
gold rings a sinister glitter. They 
took her to concerts, restaurants, 


182 


GALAXY 


fashion shows, cinematic dis- 
plays, museums and galleries. 
They urged her to buy clothes, 
to tone her skin, to make herself 
chic — all of which Drusilla re- 
sisted, from sullen perversity. 
Whereupon the women bought 
the clothes, toned her skin, ar- 
ranged her hair. Drusilla retali- 
ated by sagging, drooping, con- 
triving to look as uncouth as 
possible. Finally the women took 
her to the space port. They 
boarded a space ship which con- 
veyed them to Sirneste Cluster 
and the planet Sogdian. They ar- 
rived at the agency of Rubdan 
Ulshaziz at Atar simultaneously 
with another guest for the Palace 
of Love, Milo Ethuen, who 
stayed in Drusilla’s company for 


the remainder of the journey. 
The three women came as far 
as the Kouliha space field, then 
returned to Atar with Zog. Na- 
varth and Gersen looked around 
to inspect Ethuen, who sat on 
the verandah with the others: a 
man not unlike Tanzel and 
Mario, with a brooding face, dark 
hair, and long arms. 

The manager of the hotel 
came forth upon the verandah. 
“Ladies and gentlemen, I am 
pleased to announce that your 
wait is at an end. The guests of 
the Margrave are assembled ; you 
must now set forth on your jour- 
ney to the Palace of Love. Please 
ney to the Palace of Love. 

“Please follow me; I will con- 
duct you to your conveyance.”

PRIMARY EDUCATION 
OF THE CAMIROI 

by R. A. LAFFERTY 


Ever wonder why aliens were so 
much smarter than us? Here's why! 


ABSTRACT FROM JOINT 
REPORT TO THE GENERAL 
DUBUQUE PTA CONCERN- 
ING THE PRIMARY EDUCA- 
TION OF THE CAMIROI, Sub- 
titled Critical Observations of a 
Parallel Culture on a Neighbor- 
ing World, and Evaluations of 
THE OTHER WAY OF EDU- 
CATION. 

Extract from the Day Book: 

“Where,” we asked the Infor- 
mation Factor at Camiroi City 
Terminal, “is the office of the 
local PTA?” 

“Isn’t any,” he said cheerfully. 

“You mean that in Camiroi 
City, the metropolis of the 
planet, there is no PTA?” our 


chairman Paul Piper asked with 
disbelief. 

“Isn’t any office of it. But 
you’re poor strangers, so you de- 
serve an answer even if you can’t 
frame your questions properly. 
See that elderly man sitting on 
the bench and enjoying the sun? 
Go tell him you need a PTA. 
He’ll make you one.” 

“Perhaps the initials convey a 
different meaning on Camiroi,” 
said Miss Munch the first surro- 
gate chairman. “By them we 
mean — ” 

“Parent Teachers Apparatus, 
of course. Colloquial English is 
one of the six Earthian languages 
required here, you know. Don’t be 

184 


abashed. He’s a fine person, and 
he enjoys doing things for 
strangers. He’ll be glad to make 
you a PTA.” 

We were nonplusssed, but we 
walked over to the man indi- 
cated. 

“We are looking for the local 
PTA, sir,” said Miss Smice, our 
second surrogate chairman. “We 
were told that you might help 
us.” 

“Oh, certainly,” said the eld- 
erly Camiroi gentleman. “One of 
you arrest that man walking 
there, and we’ll get started with 
it.” 

“Do what?” asked our Mr. 
Piper. 

“Arrest him. I have noticed 
that your own words sometimes 
do not convey a meaning to you. 
I often wonder how you do com- 
municate among yourselves. Ar- 
rest, take into custody, seize by 
any force physical or moral, and 
bring him here.” 

“Yes, sir,” cried Miss Hanks 
our third surrogate chairman. 
She enjoyed things like this. She 
arrested the walking Camiroi 
man with force partly physical 
and partly moral and brought 
him to the group. 

“It’s a PTA they want, Mean- 
der,” the elder Camiroi said to 
the one arrested. “Grab three 
more, and we’ll get started. Let 
the lady help. She’s good at it.” 

Our Miss Hanks and the 


Camiroi man named Meander 
arrested three other Camiroi men 
and brought them to the group. 

“Five. It’s enough,” said the 
elderly Camiroi. “We are hereby 
constituted a PTA and ordered 
into random action. Now, how 
can we accommodate you, good 
Earth people?” 

“But are you legal? Are you 
five persons competent to be a 
PTA?” demanded our Mr. 
Piper. 

“Any Camiroi citizen is com- 
petent to do any job on the 
planet of Camiroi,” said one of 
the Camiroi men (we learned 
later that his name was Tala- 
rium), “otherwise Camiroi would 
be in a sad shape.” 

“It may be,” said our Miss 
Smice sourly. “It all seems very 
informal. What if one of you had 
to be World President?” 

“The odds are that it won’t 
come to one man in ten,” said 
the elderly Camiroi (his name 
was Philoxenus). “I’m the only 
one of this group ever to serve 
as president of this planet, and 
it was a pleasant week I spent 
in the Office. Now to the point. 
How can we accommodate you.” 
“We would like to see one of 
your schools in session,” said our 
Mr. Piper. “We would like to 
talk to the teachers and the 
students. We are here to compare 
the two systems of education.” 
“There is no comparison,” 


PRIMARY EDUCATION OF THE CAMIROI 


185 - 


said old Philoxenus, “ — meaning 
no offense. Or no more than a 
little. On Camiroi, we practice 
Education. On Earth, they play 
a game, but they call it by the 
same name. That makes the con- 
fusion. Come. We’ll go to a school 
in session.” 

“And to a public school,” said 
Miss Smice suspiciously. “Do not 
fob off any fancy private school 
on us as typical.” 

“That would be difficult,” 
said Philoxenus. “There is no 
public school in Camiroi City 
and only two remaining on the 
Planet. Only a small fraction of 
one per cent of the students of 
Camiroi are in public schools. We 
maintain that there is no more 
reason for the majority of chil- 
dren to be educated in a public 
school than to be raised in a 
public orphanage. We realize, of 
course, that on Earth you have 
made a sacred buffalo of the 
public school.” 

“Sacred cow,” said our Mr. 
Piper. 

“Children and Earthlings 
should be corrected when they 
use words wrongly,” said Philo- 
xenus. “How else will they learn 
the correct forms? The animal 
held sacred in your own near ori- 
ent was of the species bos buba - 
lus rather than bos bos, a buffalo 
rather than a cow. Shall we go 
to a school?” 

“If it cannot be a public school, 


at least let it be a typical school,” 
said Miss Smice. 

“That again is impossible,” 
said Philoxenus. “Every school on 
Camiroi is in some respect atypi- 
cal.” 

VITe went to visit an atypical 
’ " school. 

INCIDENT : Our first contact 
with the Camiroi students was 
a violent one. One of them, a 
lively little boy about eight years 
old, ran into Miss Munch, knock- 
ed her down, and broke her glass- 
es. Then he jabbered something 
in an unknown tongue. 

“Is that Camiroi?” asked Mr. 
Piper with interest. “From what 
I have heard, I supposed the 
language to have a harsher and 
fuller sound.” 

“You mean you don’t recog- 
nize it?” asked Philoxenus with 
amusement. “What a droll ad- 
mission from an educator. The 
boy is very young and very igno- 
rant. Seeing that you were 
Earthians, he spoke in Hindi, 
which is the tongue used by more 
Earthians than any other. No, 
no, Xypete, they are of the mi- 
nority who speak English. You 
can tell it by their colorless tex- 
ture and the narrow heads on 
them.” 

“I say you sure do have slow 
reaction, lady,” the little boy 
Xypete explained. “Even sub- 
humans should react faster than 


186 


GALAXY 


that. You just stand there and 
gape and let me bowl you over. 
You want me analyze you and 
see why you react so slow?” 

“No! No!” 

“You seem unhurt in structure 
from the fall,” the little boy con- 
tinued, “but if I hurt you I got 
to fix you. Just strip down to 
your shift, and I’ll go over you 
and make sure you’re all right.” 
“No! No! No!” 

“It’s all light,” said Philoxen- 
us. “All Camiroi children learn 
primary medicine in the first 
grade, setting bones and healing 
contusions and such.” 

“No! No! I’m all right. But 
he’s broken my glasses.” 

“Come along Earthside lady, 
I’ll make you some others,” said 
the little boy. “With your slow 
reaction time you sure can’t af- 
ford the added handicap of de- 
fective vision. Shall I fit you with 
contacts?” 

“No. I want glasses just like 
those which were broken. Oh 
heavens, what will I do?” 

“You come, I do,” said the 
little boy. It was rather revealing 
to us that the little boy was able 
to test Miss Munch’s eyes, grind 
lenses, make frames and have her 
fixed up within three minutes. “I 
have made some improvements 
over those you wore before,” the 
boy said, “to help compensate 
for your slow reaction time.” 
“Are all the Camiroi students 


so talented?” Mr. Piper asked. 
He was impressed. 

“No. Xypete is unusual,” 
Philoxenus said. “Most students 
would not be able to make a pair 
of glasses so quickly or com- 
petently till they were at least 
nine.” 

ANDOM INTERVIEWS: 
“How rapidly do you read?” 
Miss Hanks asked a young girl. 

“One hundred and twenty 
words a minute,” the girl said. 

“On Earth some of the girl 
students your age have learned 
to read at the rate of five hundred 
words a minutes,” Miss Hanks 
said proudly. 

“When I began disciplined 
reading, I was reading at the rate 
of four thousand words a min- 
ute,” the girl said. “They had 
quite a time correcting me of it. 
I had to take remedial reading, 
and my parents were ashamed of 
me. Now I’ve learned to read al- 
most slow enough.” 

“I don’t understand,” said Miss 
Hanks. 

i i T V) you know anything about 
Earth History or Geogra- 
phy?” Miss Smice asked a mid- 
dle-sized boy. 

“We sure are sketchy on it, 
lady. There isn’t very much over 
there, is there?” 

“Then you have never heard 
of Dubuque?” 



PRIMARY EDUCATION OF THE CAMIROI 


187 


“Count Dubuque interests me. 
I can’t say as much for the City 
named after him. I always 
thought that the Count handled 
the matters of the conflicting 
French and Spanish land grants 
and the basic claims of the Sauk 
and Fox Indians very well. Refer- 
ences to the Town now carry 
a humorous connotation, and 
‘School-Teacher from Dubuque’ 
has become a folk archetype.” 

“Thank you,” said Miss Smice, 
“or do I thank you?” 

“What are you taught of the 
relative humanity of the Earth- 
ians and the Camiroi and of their 
origins?” Miss Munch asked a 
Camiroi girl. 

“The other four worlds, Earth 
(Gaea), Kentauron Mikron, 
Dahae and Astrobe were all 
settled from Camiroi. That is 
what we are taught. We are also 
given the humorous aside that 
if it isn’t true we will still hold 
it true till something better 
comes along. It was we who re- 
discovered the Four Worlds in 
historic time, not they who dis- 
covered us. If we did not make 
the original settlements, at least 
we have filed the first claim that 
we made them. We did, in histori- 
cal time, make an additional 
colonization of Earth. You call 
it the Incursion of the Dorian 
Greeks.” 

“Where are their play- 


grounds?” Miss Hanks asked 
Talarium. 

“Oh, the whole world. The 
children have the run of every- 
thing. To set up specific play- 
grounds would be like setting S 
table-sized aquarium down in the 
depths of the ocean. It would 
really be pointless.” 

/CONFERENCE: The four of 
^ us from Earth, specifically 
from Dubuque, Iowa, were in 
discussion with the five mem- 
bers of the Camiroi PTA. 

“How do you maintain disci- 
pline?” Mr. Piper asked. 

“Indifferently,” said Philoxen- 
us, “Oh, you mean in detail. It 
varies. Sometimes we let it drift, 
sometimes we pull them up short. 
Once they have learned that they 
must comply to an extent, there 
is little trouble. Small children 
are often put down into a pit. 
They do not eat or come out till 
they know their assignment.” 

“But that is inhuman,” said 
Miss Hanks. 

“Of course. But small children 
are not yet entirely human. If a 
child has not learned to accept 
discipline by the third or fourth 
grade, he is hanged.” 

“Literally?” asked Miss 
Munch. 

“How would you hang a child 
figuratively? And what effect 
would that have on the other 
children?” 


188 


GALAXY 


“By the neck?” Miss Munch 
still was not satisfied. 

“By the neck until they are 
dead. The other children always 
accept the example gracefully 
and do better. Hanging isn’t enif 
ployed often. Scarcely one child 
in a hundred is hanged.” 

“What is this business about 
slow reading?” Miss Hanks ask- 
ed, “I don’t understand it at all.” 
“Only the other day there was 
a child in the third grade who 
persisted in rapid reading,” 
Philoxenus said. “He was given 
an object lesson. He was given 
a book of medium difficulty, and 
he read it rapidly. Then he had 
to put the book away and repeat 
what he had read. Do you know 
that in the first thirty pages he 
missed four words? Midway in 
the book there was a whole state- 
ment which he had understood 
wrongly, and there were hun- 
dreds of pages that he got word- 
perfect only with difficulty. If 
he was so unsure on material 
that he had just read, think how 
imperfectly he would have re- 
called it forty years later.” 

“You mean that the Camiroi 
children learn to recall every- 
thing that they read?” 

“The Camiroi children and 
adults will recall for life every 
detail they have ever seen, read 
or heard. We on Camiroi are 
only a little more intelligent than 
you on Earth. We cannot afford 


to waste time in forgetting or re- 
viewing, or in pursuing anything 
of a shallowness that lends itself 
to scanning.” 

“Ah, would you call your 
schools liberal?” Mr. Piper ask- 
ed. 

“I would. You wouldn’t,” said 
Philoxenus. “We do not on 
Camiroi, as you do on Earth, 
use words to niean their oppo- 
sites. There isbiothing in our edu- 
cation or on our world that cor- 
responds to the quaint servility 
which you call liberal on Earth.” 
“Well, would you call your 
education progressive?” 

“No. In your argot, progres- 
sive, of course, means infantile.” 
“How are the schools fi- 
nanced?” asked Mr. Piper. 

“Oh, the voluntary tithe on 
Camiroi takes care of every- 
thing, government, religion, edu- 
cation, public works. We don’t 
believe in taxes, of course, and 
we never maintain a high over- 
head in anything.” 

“Just how voluntary is the 
tithing?” asked Miss Hanks. “Do 
you sometimes hang those who 
do not tithe voluntarily?” 

“I believe there have been a 
few cases of that sort,” said 
Philoxenus. 

“And is your government real- 
ly as slipshod as your educa- 
tion?” Mr. Piper asked. “Are 
your high officials really chosen 
by lot and for short periods?” 

189 


PRIMARY EDUCATION OF THE CAMIROI 


“Oh yes. Can you imagine a 
person so sick that he would actu- 
ally desire to hold high office for 
any great period of time? 'Are 
there any further questions?” 
“There must be hundreds,” 
said Mr. Piper, “But we find dif- 
ficulty putting them into words.” 
“If you cannot find words for 
them, we cannot find answers. 
PTA disbanded.” 

/CONCLUSIONS: A. The Ca- 
miroi system of education is 
inferior to our own in organiza- 
tion, in buildings, in facilities, in 
playgrounds, in teacher confer- 
ences, in funding, in parental in- 
volvement, in supervision, in in- 
group out-group accommodation 
adjustment motifs. Some of the 
school buildings are grotesque. 
We asked about one particular 
building which seemed to us to 
be flamboyant and in bad taste. 
‘What do you expect from sec- 
ond-grade children?” they said, 
“It is well built: even if of pecu- 
liar appearance. Second-grade 
children are not yet complete 
artists of design.” 

“You mean that the children 
designed it themselves?” we ask- 
ed. 

“Of course,” they said. “De- 
signed and built it. It isn’t a bad 
job for children.” 

Such a thing wouldn’t be per- 
mitted on Earth. 

CONCLUSION B. The Cami- 
190 


roi system of education somehow 
produces much better results 
than does the education system 
of Earth. We have been forced to 
admit this by the evidence at 
hand. 

CONCLUSION C. There is an 
anomaly as yet unresolved be- 
tween CONCLUSION A and 
CONCLUSION B. 

APPENDIX

We give here, as perhaps of 
some interest, the curriculum of 
the Camiroi Primary Education. 

FIRST YEAR COURSE: 
Playing one wind instrument 
Simple drawing of objects and 
numbers. 

Singing. (This is important. 
Many Earth people sing who 
cannot sing. This early instruc- 
tion of the Camiroi prevents 
that occurrence.) 

Simple arithmetic, hand and ma- 
chine. 

First Acrobatics. 

First riddles and logic. 
Mnemonic religion. 

First dancing. 

Walking the low wire.

hatchet-job programming.) 

Performing on the medium wire. 

Project electric wiring. 

Raising bees. (Galelea, not earth 
bees.) 

THIRD YEAR COURSE: 

Playing one stringed instrument. 

Reading and voice. (It is here 
that the student who may have 
fallen into bad habits of rapid

Fifth Form Thesis. 

The child is now ten years old 
and is half through his primary 
schooling. He is an unfinished 
animal, but he has learned to 
learn.

History construction, active. 

Manufacture of ultra-light-bar- 

rier vehicles. 

Panphilosophical clarifications. 

Construction of viable planets. 

Consolidation of sjmple sanctity 
status. 

Charismatic humor and pentacos- 
mic logic. 

Hypogyroscopic economy. 

Penentaglossia. (the perfection of 
the fifty languages that every 
educated Camiroi must know 
including six Earthian langu- 
ages. Of course the child will 
already have colloquial mas- 
tery of most of these, but he 
will not yet have them in their 
full depth.) 

Construction of complex socie- 
ties. 

World government. (A course of 
the same name is sometimes 
given in Earthian schools, but 
the course is not of the same 
content. In this course the 
Camiroi student will govern a 
world, though not one of the 
first aspect worlds, for a period 


of three or four months.) 
Tenth form thesis. 

COMMENT ON 

CORRICULUM: 

The child will now be fifteen 
years old and will have com- 
pleted his primary education. In 
many ways he will be advanced 
beyond his Earth counterpart. 
Physically more sophisticated, 
the Camiroi child could kill with 
his hands an Earth-type tiger 
or a cape buffalo. An Earth child 
would perhaps be reluctant even 
to attempt such feats. The Cami- 
roi boy (or girl) could replace 
any professional Earth athlete at 
any position of any game, and 
could surpass all existing Earth 
records. It is simply a question 
of finer poise, strength and 
speed, the result of adequate 
schooling. 

As to the arts (on which Earth- 
lings sometimes place emphasis) 
the Camiroi child could produce 
easy and unequaled masterpieces 
in any medium. More important, 
he will have learned the relative 
unimportance of such pastimes. 

The Camiroi child will have 
failed in business once, at age 
ten, and have learned patience 
and perfection of objective by his 
failure. He will have acquired the 
techniques of falsification and 
conmanship. Thereafter he will 
not be easily deceived by any of 

193 


PRIMARY EDUCATION OF THE CAMIROI 


the citizens of any of the worlds. 
The Camiroi child will have be- 
come a complex genius and a sim- 
ple saint; the latter reduces the 
index of Camiroi crime to near 
zero. He will be married and 
settled in those early years of 
greatest enjoyment. 

The child will have built, from 
materials found around any 
Camiroi house, a faster-than- 
light vehicle. He will have piloted 
it on a significant journey of his 
own plotting and programming. 
He will have built quasi-human 
robots of great intricacy. He will 
be of perfect memory and judg- 
ment and will be well prepared 
to accept solid learning. 

He will have learned to use his 
whole mind, for the vast reser- 
voirs which are the unconscious 
to us are not unconscious to him. 
Everything in him is ordered for 
use. And there seems to be no 
great secret about the accom- 
plishments, only to do everything 
slowly enough and in the right 
order: Thus they avoid repeti- 
tion and drill which are the 
shriveling things which dull the 
quick apperception. 

The Camiroi schedule is chal- 
lenging to the children, but it is 
nowhere impossible or discourag- 
ing. Everything builds to what 
follows. For instance, the child is 
eleven years old before he is 
given post-nuclear physics and 
universals. Such subjects might 
194 


be too difficult for him at an ear- 
lier age. He is thirteen years old 
before he undertakes category 
invention, that intricate course 
with the simple name. He is 
fourteen years old when he enters 
the dangerous field of panphilo- 
sophical clarification. But he will 
have been constructing compre- 
hensive philosophies for two 
years, and he will have the back- 
ground for the final clarification. 

We should look more closely 
at this other way of education. 
In some respects it is better than 
our own. Few Earth children 
would be able to construct an 
organic and sentient robot within 
fifteen minutes if given the test 
suddenly; most of them could not 
manufacture a living dog in that 
time. Not one Earth child in five 
could build a faster-than-light 
vehicle and travel it beyond our 
galaxy between now and mid- 
night. Not one Earth child in a 
hundred could build a planet and 
have it a going concern within a 
week. Not one in a thousand 
would be able to comprehend

col- 
lapse. Its myriad worlds had already begun to 
war among themselves, plunging the universe 
into barbaric chaos. Civilization seemed doomed. 

But master scientists laboring to ensure that 
civilization would be preserved during the dark 
ages to come, established twin ‘‘Foundations” at 
opposite ends of the Galaxy, to form the nucleus 
of a new civilization, and in time to unite across 
the Galaxy to form a new ... a stronger ... a 
more enduring Second Empire. 

In Foundation and Foundation and Empire, 
we follow the course of the First Foundation an 
it rekindles the light of civilization in an ever- 
increasing portion of the Galaxy — and as it In 
confronted by its greatest crisis: a dangerous 
mutant, an evil yet brilliant psychopath whose 
soul-consuming desire is conquest of the Galaxy! 

Within a decade, he tyrannized the entire 
Galaxy — except for the Second Foundation. 
And this became his mania — to find and conquer 
the Second Foundation. Everything in the 
Galaxy must be his! .
