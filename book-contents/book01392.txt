EDITORIAL 


G reetings, Gentle Readers. I am the bearer of somber tidings. 

This is the last issue of Worlds of IF as a discrete entity — at 
least for the time being. As of January 1975, Galaxy and Worlds of 
IF will be combined into a single monthly magazine. 

The reason? A simple one: we ran out of paper — the kind of 
paper we can afford to buy, that is. We still have access to quan- 
tities sufficient for one magazine, but not two. (If we tried to put 1 
out a book with the next-higher grade we would go broke in 
nothing flat.) Subscribers: those of you with subs to both Galaxy 
and Worlds of IF will have them extended the appropriate number 
of issues. 

But be of good cheer. The rowdy, fun-loving spirit I have striven 
to infuse into this magazine will not be lost, but will sound in clear 
if muted tones in a fusion of the best of two worlds— ^the best of 
Galaxy , which has long stood for intellectual and esthetic pre- 
eminence, and the best of this magazine. And surely I don’t have to 
tell you what IF is all about! 

Here are a few of the contributions to that new magazine that 
otherwise would have appeared in Worlds of IF. The Alien View- 
point of Dick Geis will continue to delight and enrage you on a bi- 
monthly basis. The Editor's Page will also maintain a bimonthly 
presence, as will SF Calendar. Sign of the Unicom, a new Amber 
novel by Roger Zelazny (this year’s WORLDCON Guest of Honor) 
will first see print in the new Galaxy/IF. A new Mack Reynolds 
story. A new Chandler. A “Berserker.” And, (as the saying goes) 
much, much more! 

So. Life goes on, even if magazines don’t always. See you this 
January in the (new) Galaxy/(JF) — the best science-fiction 
magazine in the world! — Baen

J. A. LAWRENCE 


W hat Mellett liked about 
Knabe was that he was an 
archetype. The bulging forehead, 
vague blue eyes, the omnium 
gatherum of garments, all pro- 
claimed his Genius; which, more- 
over, he undoubtedly had. His in- 
ventions had provided him with 
sufficient funds to establish a 
private laboratory in his town 
house, complete with autoclaves, 
refrigerator-freezers, electron mic- 
roscopes, a workshop, a qualified 
assistant — and even a power plant 
installed when the professor had 
become annoyed with the inter- 
ruptions in Springfield’s electric 
power. Graduates of Springfield 
High rarely achieved such status, 
and Mellett was proud to call him 
friend. 

Regrettably, Knabe had neglect- 
ed to provide himself with the 
requisite Beautiful Daughter. How- 
ever, his assistant Miss Lockwood 
was a splendid substitute, if a little 
intimidating. 

Mellett knocked twice and 
pushed open the door leading to the 
basement laboratory. 

“Hello, Eschsholzia,” he said 
shyly. The beautiful redhead in the 
immaculate white coat glanced up 
from her microscope, smiled, and 


waved her hand toward the inner 
door. Mellett sighed. Sometimes he 
thought he might actually work up 
the courage to ask her to dinner, if 
she only indicated that she could 
spare a minute to be invited. Today 
was standard issue. 

Knobby here?’’ he asked, 
resigned. 

“Back room,” she said, concen- 
trating, one hand taking notes 
while the other adjusted the instru- 
ment. “See you later.” Aha! Things 
were looking up. With a light step 
he made his way around the desks 
piled high with dusty papers, 
crockery, astrolabes, armillary 
spheres, electro-encephalographs 
and other scientific detritus, to the 
workshop door. 

“Did you bring the transtempo- 
ral potentiometers I asked for?” 
Mellett looked for the scientist, and 
then spied him on the floor under a 
heap of wiring that filled one end of 
the room. 

“They haven’t invented them yet, 
Knobby,” he said mildly. “Sorry.” 

“Hell and damnation. Oh, well, 
I suppose I can . yes. This one 
and . there — wait a minute — 
could do the job . blast! Why do 
they make screwdrivers so badly? 
This one’s gone loose in the 


8 



haft . There!” He scrambled out 
from behind the Invention and 
drooped toward Mellett. Today his 
socks were odder than usual; one of 
his ankles was bare. 

“Aren’t you going to tell me what 
it is?” said Mellett. The last one 
had been the (M)agnetro-(A)dre- 
nalo-(K)inem-(E)lectronic Ultra- 
(P)acificator, which, when broad- 
cast over short-wave radio, had pre- 
cipitated a world-wide peace treaty 
and the voluntary propulsion of all 
weaponry into the sun. The only ill 
effect was a slight increase in the 
pulse rate due to interference with 
the sunspot pattern, which had 
lasted about thirty seconds. His 
previous achievement had been the 
Medullary Acceptor Neo-Nutrient 
Alimentory, which created a 
delicious and completely nourish- 
ing pastry out of waste plastic. 
Mellett could hardly wait. 

“All ready to go. At last. It’s 
taken much longer than I antici- 
pated — I must have been working 
on it for over six months now. 
Tch-ch.” The great scientist 
frowned. 

“I know. I’ve been counting the 
minutes.” 

“Tut, Robert, never do that. Not 
unless you were using the (C)hrono- 
(L)ymphometric (O)steo- (Orca- 
dian- (K)inesimometer — did I give 
you one?” He scratched the shin- 
ing, bald expanse of his head. 

“Yes, Knobby.” Ruefully, Mel- 
lett recollected the massive object 
in its tasteful teak casing that oc- 


cupied most of his bedroom. It kept 
subjective time and had no alarm; 
he rested his Baby Ben and hair- 
brushes on it. 

“Now, that’s time-keeping,” said 
Knabe, with simple pride. “Where 
is that girl? She’s never here when I 
want her — girl!” 

“She seems to be working. Can I 
substitute?” 

“No, no, now we celebrate. Miss 
Thing — Jones!” 

Mellett said reproachfully, 
“Really, Knobby! Her name’s 
Lockwood. Eschsholzia Lockwood. 
You ought to know it after three 
years.” 

“What d’you think I pay the girl 
for?” said the scientist irritably. 
“It’s her job to keep track of de- 
tails . ah.” 

“Yes, Dr. Knabe?” The burn- 
ished copper hair, the alabaster 
face peered through the doorway. 

“Drinks. It’s done.” I 

“It’s done?” She stood still, the 
beautiful green eyes widening. 
“Does it — does it work?” 

“Of course it will work. All my 
inventions work. Get us something 
to drink, there’s a good girl.” 

Mellett tried not to be offended, 
on her behalf, at his manner. Here 
was a girl, as intelligent as she was 
gorgeous, a Ph.D. working as sec- 
retary, receptionist, assistant and 
bottle-washer. He had seen the 
flare of resentment, quickly con- 
trolled, in the emerald eyes when 
Knabe was particularly peremp- 
tory. That she understood what the 


9 



scientist was doing, and kept the 
lab supplied with what he would be 
needing before he needed it, he 
took for granted. Sometimes 
Mellett could almost dimly perceive 
what Women’s Lib was about . 
but then, Knabe was not a Man; he 
was a Genius. 

She returned with a tray holding 
three beakers of foaming liquid. 

“Hot buttered ethanol,” she 
said, handing it around. It wasn’t 
bad. 

When they had toasted the 
success of the pile of wires, Mellett 
said, “Well, aren’t you going to tell 
me about it? Apparently Miss 
Lockwood already knows.” 

“I haven’t told anyone yet.” 
Knabe gave a deep sigh and in- 
clined his head. “You know that 
the human brain is unfinished. 
Millions of neural pathways await 
the final evolution of Man . un- 
limited potential — and what the 
brain’s capacity actually is we are 
about to discover. This — ” he 
waved his bony hand at the 
jumble — “is the prototype of the 
Maxi-Encephalo Synaptic Stimu- 
lator; it will open the doors of the 
mind of man to his ultimate 
destiny!” 

Mellett was impressed. Eschshol- 
zia broke the silence. 

“You’re sure, Dr. Knabe?” 

“Of course I’m sure.” 

“Then I want to volunteer.” 
“You?” 

“Me. Why not?” 

Why not indeed, thought Mellett 


admiringly. What a remarkable 
woman! What strength of char- 
acter! 

Knabe mused. “Well, I’d 
thought of . using a brain that 
had reached the possible op- 
timum ... I hadn’t' really ... no 
offence, but . .” 

Mellett exploded. “What’s the 
matter with you, Knobby? What 
more do you want? Miss Lockwood 
has everything — beauty, brains, 
good sense, balance — you couldn’t 
do better!” 

“Why, thank you,” said Esch- 
sholzia, blushing. 

“All right, all right. But — well, 
let’s see. Can we make it Thurs- 
day?” 

His secretary confirmed the 
appointment. 

O n the way out, Mellett said, 
“May I take you to dinner?” 
“I’d be delighted,” said the girl. 
Over the meal, he was bold. “I’ve 
been thinking it over. I don’t think 
you ought to go through with this.” 
“Why not?” she said, surprised. 
“It could be dangerous, fooling 
with your brain.” 

She laughed. “Nonsense. He was 
going to try it himself, and he 
wouldn’t risk his own head. No, 
I’m tired of being a second 
choice — ever since I discovered that 
a woman has to try twice as hard to 
get half as far. I’ve been waiting for 
a chance like this.” 

“B(it — well, I don’t like it,” said 
Mellett stubbornly. 



She sniffed. “I suppose now I get 
the line about how you don*^ want 
to change me.” 

“Well, yes. You’re almost too 
much woman now — I mean, what 
chance would I have if . .” 

“You could have the treatment 
too.” 

‘‘I — ” he stopped. Did he . 
no. He just didn’t have her guts. 

“You see?” she said. “Some of 
us have nothing to lose . Be- 
sides, what could you offer me that 
would make up for the opportunity 
to develop everything in my 
head? . Oh, don’t take it to 
heart. No mere sexual relationship 
could compete.” 

She sat starry-eyed over the 
coffee. “What will it be like, I 
wonder? The functions of the brain 
so manifold, the future evolution of 
man so mysterious ...” 


W hen the electrodes were re- 
moved from her still, partly- 
shaven head, Mellett dropped the 
copper curl he had been stroking in 
panic. 

“You’ve killed her. Oh, God, get 
a doctor . .” 

“Be quiet. She’s all right. I 
wonder if those potentiometers . 
No. She’s coming to.” 

They placed her on the decrepit 
old couch to recover. She stirred. 
Mellett watched anxiously for any 
flicker of motion in her pale face, 
while Knabe puffed serenely on his 
pipe. 


“She’s moving,” said Mellett. 

“Yes. Hmmm.” ~ 

“Oh, Eschsholzia, how do you 
feel?” Mellett dropped to his knees 
on a pile of cable beside the couch. 

“All right . My head. Feels 
funny. Leave me . alone a 
minute . ugh!” She retched. 

“What is it? She’s ill — Knobby, 
get the doctor!” 

She said faintly, “What is that 
stink?” The men sniffed; tobacco, 
ether, disinfectant, ozone; nothing 
unusual. She gasped, “Air! 
Open . window!” 

Knabe went to her, while Mellett 
wrestled with the cellar window, 
finally breaking the catch in his 
efforts to open it. Fresh air and soot 
poured in; she started to take a 
deep breath and began coughing. 

“Let’s get her upstairs. It is 
stuffy down here.” Mellett lifted 
her, still gasping, and carried her 
up to the front parlor where he laid 
her gently on the sofa. He flung 
open the casement. 

“That better?” 

Her breathing was a little easier. 
She said, “Oh, that horrible smell. 
Can’t you do something?” 

To Mellett the air seemed fresh 
and clean. There wasn’t even much 
traffic outside the house. 

“Hmm. Unanticipated effect, 
but predictable,” said Knabe inter- 
estedly. Eschsholzia seemed 
quieter, although her enchanting 
nose remained wrinkled with dis- 
gust. But she had almost stopped 
coughing.

“Would you like anything? A 
drink?” 

“Some water, please.” The 
water, eagerly swallowed, caused a 
choking fit. “It tastes like the 
smell. Funny; I suppose the process 
affected the olfactory nerves?” 

“Yes, certainly,” said Knabe. 
“All sort of connections will have 
been affected. You’ll stay here for a 
few days so we can keep complete 
notes . .” 

“Oh, no,” she said faintly. “I 
couldn’t.” 

Mellett said, “It’s all right. 
Knobby’s perfectly safe.” 

She threw him a look of sheer im- 
patience. “Oh, for heaven’s sake. 
It’s the smell, and the water. I want 
to go to my weekend place, out of 
town. I have a cottage my brother 
left me . must you smoke?” 
Knabe put down the pipe he had 
just taken from under the chair 
cushion. 

“Then, I will go with you,” he 
said. “Do you think you could get 
up yet?” 

She sat up, slowly. “Yes . it’s 
okay. My head feels woolly and 
sore . but I must get away from 
this odor.” 

Mellett’s car didn’t agree with 
her, either. 

T he next day, when Mellett 
called with a bottle of wine to 
see how she was, he found Knabe 
well into his second notebook, 
sitting at the kitchen table. 

“Fascinating, fascinating,” he 


said, waving the pencil about. 

“Had you noticed that? Is she all 
right?” ' 

“Oh, yes. Remarkably healthy 
specimen. The early effects are 
wearing off. I expect great things.” 

“Where is she?” 

“Up there.” Knabe gestured 
vaguely toward the ceiling. Assum- 
ing that he meant the upstairs bed- 
room, Mellett started to the stair- 
case. 

“Hi, Bob!” He looked around. 

“Up here.” She was hanging by 
her knees on the thick wooden 
curtain rail. 

“What are you doing up there?” 
said Mellett, swallowing nervously. 
She wore a green bikini. 

“I was having a nap, of course.” 
She dropped, landing gracefully on 
all fours. 

“A nap?” he said blankly. “On 
the curtain rod?” 

“Mmm. Much more comfort- 
able.” 

“Er — how’s the smell problem?” 

“Pretty awful — but I’ve learned 
how to turn it off with breathing a 
certain way. Otherwise I feel quite 
pleasant. I see and hear much 
better.” She padded with bare feet 
toward the kitchen. “I’ll get you 
something nice to drink. I’ve just 
discovered it.” 

Mellett watched the retreat of the 
green bikini in rapt admiration. 
Suddenly, she jumped in the air 
and came down facing the opposite 
way, her back to the comer, semi- 
crouched.

IF 



“What’s the matter?” he said, 
startled. 

Her hands dropped from the de- 
fensive position and she stood up. 
“Oh, it was just a plane passing 
over. Sorry. Be right back.” 

Knabe said as he wandered in, 
“Don’t expect alcohol. She doesn’t 
approve of it.” 

It was, in the event, milk, which 
seemed to be mostly cream. 

“Isn’t it lovely?” she said. “Oh, 
Knobby, that caudal reflex again.” 
“C-caudal reflex?” Mellett hoped 
he didn’t understand. 

“I keep wanting to move my tail, 
especially when I like something as 
much as this drink,” she said. 

“Look, just what have you done 
to her?” demanded Mellett. “What 
has her . er . tail got to do 
with the expansion of the brain?” 
“It’s still too early to tell,” said 
Knabe. “She’s very healthy. I am 
keeping complete notes.” 

“Besides, I’m having fun. I never 
felt so good,” said Eschsholzia. She 
sat, a fluid motion, her legs curling 
under her. 

Mellett discovered that the com- 
bination of milk, unexpected be- 
havior and exposed Eschsholzia 
was making him nervous. She 
seemed as intelligent as ever, and 
somehow there was a great deal 
more of her physical presence. He 
withdrew, promising to call again. 

T he next time he brought roses. 

“She’s out in the garden,” said 
Knabe, who answered the door. A

preoccupied frown had taken up 
residence between his brows. “I 
don’t mind admitting, Bob, I don’t 
quite understand it.” 

Fortunately, the garden was se- 
cluded. Eschsholzia was there, all 
of her. The bikini was nowhere to 
be seen. Eschsholzia was — “Wow!” 
said Mellett reverently. 

“Yes, yes,” said Knabe. “But — 
well, go and talk to her.” 

She was rolling in the grass on 
her back. Mellett swallowed and 
started for the back door. “I don’t 
think I can. Talk. I’m not used 
to . couldn’t she put something 
on?” 

“She won’t. She has refused to 
wear clothing for two days. She says 
it irritates her. It’s a good thing it’s 
summer.” 

In a futile attempt to dim his 
vision, Mellett donned his sun 
glasses. At least the look in his eyes 
wouldn’t embarrassxhim. She was a 
natural redhead. 


THE DESCENT OF MAN

“Hello!” she called, sitting up. 
She shook cut grass off her shoul- 
der with a spectacular wriggle. 
Mellett’s sun glasses fell off. 

“You’re turning very red,” she 
said. “Too much sun already? 
Damn! I’ve got a thorn.” She 
brought her toe to her mouth and 
pulled at it with teeth and fingers. 
Mellett fumbled with the glasses — 
the earpieces seemed to bend the 
wrong way — and finally replaced 
them on his slippery nose. 

“Er— . Hello. How is it?” 

“It’s — ” She gnawed at the toe. 
“ — great. Oof. There.” She gave 
the toe a last soothing lick and put 
it down. “Knobby’s all twitchy. He 
doesn’t like it.” 

“Doesn’t like what?” said 
Mellett cautiously. 

“What’s happened, his ma- 
chine.” She lay back and nibbled a 
long blade of grass. A hoverfly lit 
on her thigh; the skin twitched and 
it flew off, followed by the sun- 
glasses. 

“Do you know yet?” said 
Mellett, trying to keep his eyes 
closed. 

“Oh, yes. He was wrong, for 
once. He’ll never admit it though. 
He’s blaming it on the transtem- 
poral potentiometers, but that’s 
just an evasion.” 

Averting his eyes, since she was 
now stroking her nipples with the 
grass, Mellett mumbled, “What is 
it, then?” 

“All those unused portions of the 
brain ... they’re not future poten- 


tial, they’re evolutionary dis- 
cards ... I have all the reflexes, 
senses, instincts and so on that we 
lost in evolution. I can smell people 
several streets away. I expect I 
could catch fish with my hands . 
I can mo \efast. Look!” She sat up, 
her hand flashed out and closed. 
She brought it nearer to Mellett, 
who had to look, and opened it. 
Released, a gnat darted off. 

“But that means . .” 

“Poor Knobby. Yes. Man’s brain 
is evolved as far as it ever will, we’ve 
reached the end of the road. Pity. 
But there it is . What unusual 
animals men are! I’m not in heat 
just now so forget it.” 

Mellett felt himself turn bright 
scarlet; and ran. In the cottage 
Knabe was staring morosely at a 
glass of creamy milk. He said, “Did 
she tell you?” 

Mopping his streaming face, 
Mellett said, “Yes. But she says 
you don’t believe it.” 

“How can I? It’s not possible. 
The brain is designed to develop 
much further than — this . .” he 
stared helplessly at Mellett. 

“Maybe it’s not so bad. She 
doesn’t seem to be exactly suffer- 
ing .. and after 1 all, she hasn’t 
lost anything.” 

“Oh, she’s all right. A healthy 
animal. Never mind her . .” He 
lowered his voice. “I always did 
think women had limited cortical 
capacities. I meant to try it on a 
man first. That would prove me 
right.”

Mellett looked out of the window 
again. Eschsholzia was lying 
stretched out in the sun, arching 
her back to the warmth, gloriously 
desirable . 

“Me,’ he said firmly. “Now’s 
your chance. Come on.’’ Knabe 
blinked, called to Eschsholzia that 
he would be back shortly, and at 
the determined pressure of Mellett’s 
hand at his elbow allowed himself 
to be driven back to the lab. 


jty head aches. And does it 

lYX s ti n k’’’ said Mellett faintly. 
“For Christ’s sake, put out that 
pipe. Yecch.’’ 

Something had to be done about 
the air or he would be sick. 
Suddenly the process became 
obvious; he closed off the passage 
back of his nose and breathed 
through his throat. The smell sub- 
sided; but it was harder to talk. 

He rested for half an hour. 
Knabe said, “I shouldn’t leave 
Miss Jones alone much longer. 
We’ll have to get back to her 
place.*’ 

Smiling, Mellett said, “Fine. 
Let’s go.’’ He stood up carefully. 
What a mess this place was — the 
Maxi Encephalo Synaptic Stimu- 
lator all over the floor, dust, beetle 
dung, insect footprints all over the 
walls and ceiling. Ugh. 

Eschsholzia came to the door 
holding a towel. “Oh, it’s you,” she 
said, tossing it on a chair. Cau- 
tiously, Mellett re-opened his newly 


sensitive nose. She was gorgeous. 

But strangely, his feelings were 
warm, tender, admiring, without 
the tension of desire. She really 
wasn’t in heat. 

Two days later, they told Knabe. 
“We’re sorry, Knabe, but it’s true. 
Those doors in the brain open 
backward. Homo sapiens, as he 
stands in stocking feet, is it.” 

Grimly, Knabe packed up his 
eighteen filled notebooks and one 
dreadful sock. “It was the potenti- 
ometers. I know it was. No more 
makeshifts. I shall have to invent 
that and start again ...” He 
stumped off, muttering, and hailed 
a taxi. 

Together, Mellett and Eschshol- 
zia waved good-bye. “Maybe we 
should have told him about the 
water.” 

“No,’ she said. “It would have 
been too unkind. But what fun it’s 
going to be! I always wondered 
what it would be like to be amphi- 
bious!” 

“And what a way to make a 
living! That Dolphin Research 
Group is ready to pay us anything.” 

“So they should. They won’t find 
a team with our qualifications any- 
where else!” 

Laughing, they ran out into the 
garden and licked salt off each 
other’s backs, basking in the sun. 
As Mellett rolled over and nipped 
her ear, she whispered, “Hey, I 
think ... I think I’m coming into 
season.” •

STORMY WEATHER 


DANIEL DERN 


T he Thursday evening sun 
burrowed down under burning 
clouds as the autumn winds began 
to blow, and a cloak of chilled 
darkness settled over the Vermont 
horizon. In the cabin by the trail 
overlooking the field, Rachel 
puttered around, unpacking the 
bag of groceries into the cabinet 
and shaking her sleeping bag to 
fluff out the down. Matty had 
driven her there that afternoon and 
left her, plunked on the edge of the 
Appalachian' Trail. Until Matty re- 
turned on Saturday morning. 


Rachel was free, alone with moun- 
tains covered with the impossible 
riot of Vermont springtime. 
Greens, reds, purples and yellows; 
in clumps and mosaics, a sight so 
overpowering as to be unreal to eyes 
grown in the city and used to nature 
only in small doses. A row of 
bushes. A concrete-circled tree. 
Now there were no people and no 
expectations, nobody tapping their 
foot while she took time to breathe. 

She stood still and closed her 
eyes, unable to comprehend the re- 
lease that filled her. Nobody ask- 


17 



ing, nobody demanding. She could 
go to sleep when she pleased, and 
never wake up. Not feel something 
was wanted from her. Not deny her 
feelings of waiting, waiting for 
twenty-one years for someone un- 
known to give her something she 
needed, something everybody else 
had but she couldn’t see. Here no 
one watched, here she could play 
her flute, press her face to the 
grass, draw cartoons on her legs, 
wash or not wash her hair — her life 
again. 

To do anything she pleased. 

Whatever that was. 

Y esterday somebody had come 
to borrow a dictionary— a 
girl from the other end of the 
dorm, in the usual tennis shorts 
and halter. And then her room- 
mate’s boyfriend stopped in, an- 
noyed because his car needed new 
tires, and Mark had shown up 
while she was working on a paper 
and ended up dragging het to a 
mild party where he sat in a corner 
and looked depressed, so clearly 
waiting for her to talk to him, 
and — 

Somewhere it became too much, 
and she snapped. Back from the 
party, needing a shower, Rachel 
was sorting her psych notes when 
the dormline rang. She stared at 
the blrt \ ng instrument, not moving 
while it rang, waited, rang. Then 
she lunged for the closet, jerked out 
her backpack, stuffed in clothes 
and toothbrush and flute, pulled 


the straps tight over her shoulders 
and ran through the warm starry 
night to Matty’s dorm as the wind 
scraped leaves along the street be- 
hind her. 

She spent the night in mad 
dreams and cold, clammy sweat, 
and woke unsure of where she was. 
Matty announced they could 
borrow her uncle’s hill house off in 
the country, she’d called and it was 
okay. While Rachel frowned Matty 
tossed the backpack into the rear 
seat next to the grocery bags; when 
Rachel was almost decided Matty 
prodded her into the Volvo’s shot- 
gun seat, sat behind the steering 
wheel and stomped the accelerator, 
swerving through the wild-colored 
hills with manic glee. The city 
dropped away, the fields were filled 
with cows and dandelions, and then 
there was nothing of the outside 
world left save the fading putter of 
Matty’s Volvo. 

Now Rachel could sleep or sing, 
commit rash acts without listening 
for judgments. A black bird with 
red armpits had paused on the 
fence. The stream gurgled clearly 
over each patch of stones, making 
subtly different splashes in every 
place. The cows raised their rumps 
and dignifiedly trudged home. 
Rachel had napped for half the 
afternoon as the wind fanned the 
colored tips of the trees before her 
like a eunuch wielding a peacock’s 
tail. Then the clouds came, waking 
her with their shadows, and she re- 
turned to the cabin. 


18 



R achel stepped barefoot into the 
night. The sky was completely 
covered by clouds, the outlines of 
the mountains identified the 
thicker shadows. Several fireflies 
flitted about, like the spirit of some 
ancient machine released from its 
bottle. The wind blew through her 
sweater and prickled her arms. 
Branches flapped, leaves fled the 
ground in circling flocks. A peal of 
thunder broke beyond the moun- 
tains. Then the landscape lit up, 
and thunder rolled again. Rachel 
heard, then felt, rain. A wet 
kitten’s-paw batted her nose. She 
held out her arms and began to 
dance. Right forward, left side, to- 
gether, stomp; right forward, left 
side . she chanted the modal 
melody and led the line of dancers 
around in interwoven circles as the 
sky crumbled above her. 

And far beyond the storm, a man 
almost passed by. He was going 
from here to there when there was a 
disturbance, an unexpected belch 
in the fabric of complex space, and 
suddenly (as perception goes) he 
was falling into space. To us he 
would have looked unprotected, 
naked and sure to die, but he was 
not in danger for this reason. A 
mesh of energies enfolded him as a 
lobster’s shell surrounds the softer 
flesh, linked with him in proper 
manners to make space his natural 
environment; he survived, he per- 
ceived, he acted. By luck, he had 
not been killed in the exo-spatial 
earthquake. But it was closer than 


it should have been, and now he 
was in trouble. 

This — we shall call him a man, 
and then call this man Muldaur — 
he realized he was hurt, and probed 
for a place to make an emergency 
landing. Reflexes took over, feeling 
the tugs of gravity wells, smelling 
atmospheric qualities, sorting the 
cocktail-chatter babble of informa- 
tion that filled our solar system. 
Asteroids grunted and satellites 
gossiped like housewives,' the 
planets frowned and harumphed, 
and the sun chortled happily, 
throwing out streams of electro- 
magnetic confetti as it jiggled its 
plasma playtoys and watched the 
elements build. Training selected 
actions without conscious thought, 
guiding Muldaur’s fall from nether- 
space into our 3-space in a jerky 
cosmic downshift that left him 
hurtling at Earth in a roughly 
matched orbit and velocity. And 
still falling, tumbling. Muldaur 
flexed his “wings” as he whipped 
around the Moon, trying to slow 
and steady himself. He began scan- 
ning the planet “below” him* with 
his many senses. Spots on the sur- 
face registered; where we would 
have seen only vast expanses of 
cloud layers and swathes of blue 
and brown, he sensed the great 
concentrations of life, energy and 
motion. Paris . Moscow . 
Tokyo . Los Angeles, Chi- 
cago . New York. Muldaur 
didn’t know these names, of 
course. But he veered downwards. 


STORMY WEATHER

diverting energies as best he could 
to safen his fall. He glowed. Those 
who watched the sky thought they 
saw a falling star. Some old men 
heard meteor whistles of radar 
shriek in their fillings, and shook 
their heads. 

And just when Muldaur was al- 
most down, slowing himself as best 
he was able, he rode an energy 
braid into the center of the 
thunderstorm. His ionized protec- 
tive web drew half a dozen bolts of 
lightning, revealing the countryside 
with brief flickers of day. He jerked 
and twisted in midair. The bolts 
disrupted his already wavering 
neural controls so completely that 
he fell the rest of the way down, 
shot with pain and fear. 

Had he not been a bit awake 
when he hit the ground, he would 
have died. 

As it happened, he lived. And 
celebrated this success by fainting. 


R achel woke in the morning to 
the far-off lowing of the cows. 
She^pulled her arms out of the 
sleeping bag and stared at the dark 
wood beam above her. Sometime 
during the night the roof had 
stopped making rain sounds, and 
she knew without looking that it 
was going to be a bright day. She 
closed her eyes to try and recapture 
her last dream, but it was gone, so 
she pulled down the zipper and got 
out of bed. 

Quickly pulling on her shirt and 


jeans, Rachel paused in the kitchen 
only long enough to swallow some 
orange juice straight from the 
bottle. Then she ran outside. 

The grass was deep green in the 
morning sun, and the ground so 
wet as to almost be muddy. The 
stream ran with greater speed and 
bulk. Rachel moved her bare feet 
from stone to stone until she reach- 
ed a certain spot, then knelt to 
drink. As she cupped her hands, 
her eyes caught a wavy spot of mo- 
tion farther along the stream, a 
faint blurring like heat shimmer 
from an overheated car on a hot 
day. 

Muldaur, crumped on a bush, 
breathed weakly. He had not 
wakened or moved since his fall. 
The shimmering indicated that his 
automatic nerve reflexes continued 
to work. But of course Rachel did 
not know this, nor did it occur to 
her to stop and think. As soon as 
she saw the folded figure, she ran to 
it. Something told her there were 
no broken bones, and without hesi- 
tating she shouldered the uncon- 
scious body with a fireman’s carry 
and headed back to the cabin. 


M uldaur was in a basket 
woven of fire. He was held 
down by a strange gravity and filled 
with unfamiliar air. When he was 
awake enough to realize he was 
conscious he caught his breath, 
only to have his stomach muscles 
branded with pain. He gasped. 
Then he withdrew and observed. 


20 


IF 



His body was full of wrongnesses 
which blinked. They hurt, too, but 
the pains were receding. So his by- 
passes were on the job. He was tired 
and drained, bruised, battered, 
and downright miserable. However, 
that could all be cured by food and 
sleep. There seemed to be no 
damage his body could not repair. 
Given the time. 

Need signals for protein and 
energy began flashing. The aware- 
ness sent Muldaur into one of the 
sequences of checkout rituals. He 
chanted silently, touching his 
psychic frets and listening for the 
proper harmonics. His feelings of 
disorientation worried him far 
more than the wooziness; the 
energy patterns which wove his web 
and wings were his uniform and 
ship, protective device and sensory 
extension. 

The diagnostic was not good. 

Now what, he wondered. Still in 
the stretched -time quiet of contem- 
plation, Muldaur reviewed various 
lectures they had given him when 
he was first training. He had never 
been caught in so extreme an emer- 
gency. Much guesswork lay 
ahead — if luck was with him. If he 
could work safely — if he could 
find — then his thoughts broke on a 
log jam. Where? He yanked at his 
memory. Sensations of falling, 
burning, caught like a canoe in a 
a waterfall — the disturbance! — a 
blue and white disk spinning 
around a sun. Muldaur turned 
himself outwards again, still letting 


his body work without direction, 
but listening. He felt an enclosed 
space, shells of cellulose, and little 
power or metal. Then he opened his 
eyes and tried to focus. 

There was life close by. His 
adrenals were relaxed, saying, 
Safe, don't worry, okay to lie still, 
but he frantically rolled his eyes, ig- 
noring the pain, until he found a 
face, a worried face, as human as 
his own. Looking at him with un- 
certain blue eyes. The reassuring 
hue of his own familiar flesh. 

u ^lOOD morning, v Rachel 
\Jsaid. Was this real? Could 
he understand her? Why had she 
brought him in, anyway? “How are 
we today?” she prattled, as if he 
were a wounded animal. He had 
been so still, and she could see the 
pain in his face when he tried to 
move. “Am I supposed to be a 
nurse or a reporter? Here, can you 
drink this — it’s water.” She moved 
closer to Muldaur, slowly, and 
brought a glass of water into his 
sight. Then she pressed the rim to 
his lips and let him taste the water. 
He let his mouth open a bit more, 
so she tilted the glass until he had 
swallowed it all. 

What next, she wondered. I 
couldn’t have just left him. She rose 
and went into the kitchen. The 
water was too cold, and a thick 
layer of sugar remained undis- 
solved at the bottom of the glass. 
She touched a sweetened finger to 
the — what was he, anyway? He 


STORMY WEATHER 


21 



looked human, aside from the blue 
dCTiim suntan and the way the hairs 
on her arm stood out when she 
came close to him. He wasn’t much 
bigger than she was; she had lifted 
him without much effort. Maybe 
five foot eight, muscled lean like an 
acrobat, smooth -skinned face, 
gentle features. Her finger tingled 
as she pressed it to his lips; he 
closed his eyes for an instant and 
then seemed to nod for more. “You 
want this stuff?” Rachel asked, to 
make sure. The darker blue lips 
opened in answer. 

Rachel pulled up a chair and 
stared at the man after he swallow- 
ed the last of the sugar-water. 
There again — man. Was it safe to 
assume anything? Would she kill 
him quicker by her care? How 
could she communicate with this — 
this obligation? 

She looked again at his blue 
skin — no, that was like calling her 
own skin “white.” She rubbed her 
wrist absently. There was probably 
a good reason. 

Why bother at all? That was the 
real question. Hadn’t she run away 
for just that reason? Everybody 
demanding, intruding . 

But the question answered itself. 
Because he needs me. And even 
that was rationalization. He had 
been there, and she had picked him 
up. 

Rachel found herself wondering, 
where did he come from, who is he, 
what's this all about? She sat up 
suddenly as she saw his eyes look- 


ing af her. She looked back r and 
became aware of her charge as a 
person. He's been thinking also. 
Suddenly it all turned real. She 
started to back away, but he looked 
at her. He doesn't understand, 
either. She felt his uncertainty and 
his fear. Then she found herself 
moving closer, as if it would help 
understanding. She saw his 
stomach muscles moving under the 
grey-silver cloth that covered him 
like dancer’s tights. Sadness over- 
came her that they couldn’t com- 
municate, and she rested her head 
on his chest. He breathed in, and 
out, and his heart beat under her 
ear. The shirt or whatever felt sur- 
prisingly soft. There was no sensa- 
tion of static electricity on her 
head, although her arms still 
tingled. She closed her eyes. 

There was a touch on her head, 
of hands. Muldaur had raised his 
arms until he was able to touch 
Rachel’s temples with his finger- 
tips. She felt the fingers brush her 
hair and tingle in her scalp. There 
were bright spots in her mind’s eye 
at every touch, each a different 
color. The glows spread until they 
joined, and then began to hum. She 
felt herself falling, gently, drifting 
into sleep, watching herself from a 
distance as the forming images 
stopped needing her control. 
Words began to whisper in her 
ears, old lessons, lists, teachers 
pointing at blackboards, trips to 
the zoo where the tigers drowsed in 
their cages, her father calling out 


22 


IF 



the gears on the transmission, 
pages from a cookbook . 

The images began to flow faster, 
louder; the demand grew greater 
and started to pull the words out. It 
all began to spin, and Rachel grew 
afraid. Tendrils reached out into 
her, forbidden parts, and she tried 
to scream. Then another force 
reached in and twisted the flow _ 
shut, making sudden silence, and 
the world went black. 

T hen the hands stopped pressing 
and she sat up, shaking her 
head. The room was still spinning. 
Rachel closed her eyes, took a slow 
breath in and out, and looked down 
again. The red eyes blinked, and 
aquamarine lips smiled, showing 
regular, white teeth. 

“Hello,” he said to her slowly. 
“Thank you for your language. My 
name is Muldaur. Are you feeling 
correct? I am injured, but not ill. 
Perhaps there is more water? It has 
been — " 

“Please," Rachel said. “Stop.” 
What had he done? “I’ll get you 
some more water. Stay there.” 
What would she do now? She let 
the water run out of the kitchen 
tap, waiting for it to get cold. 

The first hurdle is crossed, Mul- 
daur thought. What a curious lan- 
guage ! So imprecise, yet so expres- 
sive. His training and talents had 
enabled him to probe for the 
needed knowledge and absorb most 
of it in those brief instants he con- 
tacted Rachel’s memory before his

weakened control grew too de- 
manding and forced him to 
withdraw. Now his subconscious 
would integrate the information in- 
herent in the language while he 
pondered the many objects in 
Rachel’s world. Earth, Sun, New 
York, New York, Brahms, Dang- 
ling Conversation ... he rolled the 
sounds on his tongue as the images 
and associations unwound in his 
mind’s eye. Girl, star, running, 
grass, clouds, peppermint, dan- 
druff. This must be one of the 
Tammaro colonies, long forgotten. 
She doesn't look too afraid. She’s 
young. Good reactions, for an 
aborigine. He frowned at this 
thought. That’s wrong. She is 
human. I mustn't trifle with her. 

The sugar and water had revived 
him somewhat, so he tried sitting 
up. Too soon! he thought as the 
pain forced him back down. It’s 
several — he searched for the local 
equivalent — yes, days ’ere l can 
stand. And fly away? Go to, Mali- 
dourt Muldaur Sellim’pse. Your 
energies are sore taxed, and you 
will tarry long. 

Startled, Muldaur shifted his 
thinking back into his own langu- 
age. Where did all that come from? 
Hmmrn, yes, I must have tapped 
that without noticing. I’d best be 
cautious about that; this language 
has bad thoughts buried in it. So 
many words ! 

I may as well organize all this 
while I’m resting. I'll have quite a 
report to file. Another lost colony.

Eighty-two percent standard grav- 
ity. Old sun, adolescent planet, 
exotic people. Where is my lady 
dispatcher tonight? 

Muldaur ignored the problems 
inherent in the use of the word “to- 
night.” Instead, he drifted into a 
memory of half a year ago, and 
gave himself over to his past seifs 
being. The multicolored sands 
crackled at the touch of their feet, 
tickling them with snaps of light 
and static. Her tan was dark and 
smooth* and in the water her laugh 
glinted like sunlight. The soft sea 
creatures they called to came near, 
and they mounted, avoiding the 
blowholes, racing in the slow-falling 
waters until they grew tired of the 
chase, and collapsed back on 
shore. Their love play made a 
shower of sparks and crackles, 
doused at rhythmic intervals by the 
night tide, as they moved and 
whispered and exploded . yes, 
that was us, then, that looks like 
her now, near . 

“Asleep again,"” Rachel mutter- 
ed with approval, and set the glass 
of water down on the table. 


hat shall I do with him? 
Rachel stepped outside, 
chewing on a sandwich and watch- 
ing a trio of squirrels play hop- 
scotch in the branches of a tree. 
She could just leave when Matty 
came for her in two days. No I 
couldn't. Take him with her? That 
would be good for a mess. What 


had happened? There was all that „ 
shuffling in her head, and then he 
spoke to her. Mel-darr. That's his 
name. How had he done that? 

The sky was clouding in one cor- 
ner, promising more rain. The 
squirrels dashed away. A cloud 
shadow flowed along the hillside, 
turning the treetops briefly dark. I 
wish I knew what was going on. She 
turned and went back through the 
kitchen door. There she rummaged 
around until she found several 
packages of clear soup broth, and 
set the water to boiling. When the 
soup was done, she poured it into 
two ceramic mugs and carried them 
into the room where her skyblue 
starman lay sleeping. 

H e smiled at her when he woke, 
and smelled the still-steaming 
broth eagerly. “Thank you. I could 
eat something more solid, I believe. 
Did I tell you my name?” 

“Mel-darr,” Rachel said. “No?” 
He corrected her pronunciation. 
“Mull-dour would be closer. Your 
language has the wrong phonemes. 
Your name I did not get, please?” 
“You didn’t?” 

“I only looked in your speech 
and memory centers for the langu- 
age, understand. So as not to in- 
trude. Some are touchy, without 
permission.” He grimaced. “There 
have been a few unhappy inci- 
dents . see, I acquire skill in 
your tongue with every, um, 
moment.” 

“My name is Rachel. And you

IF 



haven’t told me how bad you are 
hurt, or where you came from or 
why you’re here or — ” 

“Please.” He waved a hand. “In- 
deed, it is a tale of length I should 
tell. Sit comfortable while I un- 
ravel, and then you can ask again, 
if you have more questions.” 
“Fine,” Rachel said. She set the 
mug down and leaned back in the 
chair. “Hit it.” 

“Pardon?” 

“Take it from the top, let’er roll. 
Didn’t you get any slang? Go 
ahead.” 

Muldaur rolled his eyes. "I will 
assume you gave me leave to be- 
gin — Rachel. Yes. My full name is 
Malidaurt Muldaur Sellim’pse, 
which 'is my patron’s — no, god- 
father seems clpser — name, my 
personal name, and lineage, as well 
as the fact that my — parents — 
exercised gene selection which has 
been augmented by vo-vocational 
training and surgery. In my langu- 
age the process is called callopsei, 
from calee opesi, or destiny of 
action. I was born about, well, a 
gross and some dozens of your 
years ago — pardon, about two hun- 
dred — but I am only some seven 
doz — eighty years aged, because 
of . hmm. Ah, yes. Relativity. 
Yes, good, that’s the reason. And 
I’ve lived about one-fifth of my life 
span by now. So actually I’m but a 
little older than you, don’t you 
agree?” 

“Oh, definitely!” 

“Anyway, I’m a workingman — a 


messenger of sorts.” Muldaur 
paused. “No . I’m getting words 
like telegram, envoy, special de- 
livery, but they’re too limited. Let 
me try to explain better ...” 

after exploration (Muldaur said) 
jf\ communication and trade ac- 
counted for most of the intragalac- 
tic shuttling around. Tourist 
trades, government commissions, 
scholarly and scientific studies, all 
contributed to the constant flux of 
matter and information between 
star systems. Hauling cargoes and 
delivering messages made up the 
bulk of spatial traffic. 

Methods of getting things from 
here to there varied tremendously 
within the galaxy, depending on 
technical sophistication, distances, 
times and priorities involved. One 
centuries-old firm sent its deliveries 
out in slow asteroidal form, while 
another twin-planet system used a 
short-rang pulsed matter trans- 
mitter for local import-export busi- 
ness. And so on . 

The other problem was messages. 
Electromagnetic radiation is much 
too slow to talk between stars, and 
not reliable. Although near-instan- 
taneous communication was be- 
coming more practical as well as 
economical eve^y century, there 
was still room for improvement . 

“Meanwhile,” Muldaur said, 
making a palms-in-front-of-chest- 
and -facing gesture, “one derives 
me. And the Interstellar Pony Ex- 
press — is that right? Hold, yes, but

clumsy. Couriers. Bumblebees. 
Anagrams — crab! Do you see?” he 
asked, helplessly. 

“I get it,” said Rachel, trying not 
to giggle. “Please, go on.” 

“We’re trained,” he continued. 
“Discipline, surgery, esprit de 
corps. I am a body inside a cocoon, 
ganged to my lower cortex and as 
part of me as my arms and legs. It 
is part of me, non-material. Web, 
weaving, psycho-electric tapes- 
try ... I have roughly twenty-three 
senses above the regular nine, can 
ride the waves of space’s energy — 
you're lacking words — in space I’m 
like a fish in water, wings of power. 

I glide above space itself, between 
the — the levels, seams, quanta — 
no!” He stopped again in disgust. 
Rachel wrinkled her nose as if it 
would aid her in understanding, 
while Muldaur grimaced again. 
“As I said. I carry messages, make 
negotiations, deliver mail, monitor 
conditions, patrol welfares. We 
have a glorious life, slipping out of 
spacetime, playing a role in it, 
doing and feeling ...” His eyes 
unconsciously looked up as his 
voice trailed off. “. but I had an 
accident. I was riding the — I hit 
a . pothole? Thin spot? Hot 
bog? It surprised me . suddenly 
I was drained and snapped into 
space, and homed in on this planet 
to crashland, but then I ran 
through an ionic field — yes, a 
thunderstorm. Nearly burnt out my 
nervous system. Mara stilo, was 
that wild. Can’t remember much 


without doing a — oh. not again. I 
could, if 1 needed to. Take my word 
for it. They’ll get it out when I re- 
port. And here 1 am.” 

“Yeah. Here you are.” Rachel 
leaned closer. “That’s all pretty 
weird, you know, I guess it makes 
sense. But so what? Here you are, 
with this story, and these words 
you’ve pulled out of my skull. And 
I’ve got you here. In two days 
Matty's coming back. You going to 
be all better by then? Or will this be 
weeks and months? I can just see it. 
What am I doing, having you here? 
I don’t know anything about what 
to do. I don’t want any part of it. I 
just want — ” 

“Rachel!” Muldaur reached out 
to take her hand. She jerked back. 
“Please. You’re asking questions I 
can’t answer. This is short. 
Please.” 

But she had collapsed on his 
chest again, sobbing. He stroked 
the back of her head, ignoring the 
pain signals as best he could. 
People! Females! Was there ever 
any chance of understanding this 
particular person, of really touch- 
ing her. “What do you want me to 
say, Rachel? Tell me. I’m tired, 
and it hurts. And I don’t have these 
answers.” 

She continued to cry. Muldaur 
realized she was crying for herself. 
He had not caused the upset, only 
triggered it. After a while he re- 
treated a bit and went into the 
Griever’s Litany, hoping the mood 
would project. Relax. Don’t cry. 



Enough is gone. Quiet. Relax. 
Shhh . there you go. Relax. 
Sleep. Good, good. Quiet. Peace. 
Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. 

T he squirrels had come in by 
the open kitchen window and 
were nibbling at crumbs. Clouds 
now covered most of the sky; only 
the corner where the sun was 
setting remained clear. Rachel and 
Muldaur leaned against an oak. A 
solid meal had put him in good 
enough spirits to hobble outside, 
with Rachel’s assistance. Neither 
mentioned her outburst earlier in 
the afternoon. 

“Your weather certainly is im- 
pressive,” he said after a long 
silence. 

“Why, thank you!” 

“Do you control it?” 
“Sometimes,” she said judicious- 
ly, “we predict it correctly a day in 
advance.” 

“Oh.” 

“Is it just a job — flying from 
world to world?” Rachel asked. 
“Does it ever get dull? Don’t you — 
do you ever wish for something 
else?” 

“I could,” he answered after a 
while. “Opportunity abounds. We 
still have a — frontier. But I’m — it’s 
more than a job, Rachel. It’s life. 
Religion. Immersion. Fulfillment.” 
“But are you happy?” 

“Only rarely do I feel not happy. 
If I understand what you mean. I’m 
here. This is now. That is all. Does 
that answer?” 


“I. guess so. Muldaur?” 

“Yes?” 

“Are you — your people — beyond 

us?” 

“1 would say . based on . 
we are all equally human, Rachel. 
I’ve had more time. Other fillings. 
That makes differences. But I 
think that the gulf is only the same 
one that separates any being from 
another. Which is why we attempt 
to cross it.” 


^^-^onna rain soon. Hour, may- 
be less.” 

“How can you tell, Rachel?” 

“Smells like it. Let’s head back 
inside.” She helped Muldaur stand 
up, then put a supporting arm 
around his waist. “How are you 
feeling?” 

“Better. A power source would 
help. These matters can be speed- 
ed. I still have to rework my co- 
coon.” 

“For now, we’d better get this 
plafce rainproofed again. Buckets. 
Windows — and down you go. No 
more exercise tonight. Doctor’s 
orders.” 

“Yes, my lady.” 

“Wait — Matty’s supposed to 
come tomorrow!” 

“A friend?” 

“Yes, but — ” She sat down and 
frowned. “I don’t know.” 

“Do you have a supply of food?” 

“Why?” 

“I could — do certain things. 
Juryrig. Improvise. Liferaft? A 
fudge factor.”

“What are you trying to say?” 
“If I had enough nourishment, I 
could try and accelerate healing 
enough — ’•’ 

“I thought you needed power 
from somewhere.” 

“I do. However, there seems to 
be some radio antenna a mile or so 
distant which I could focus from. 
Plus these power lines.” 

“That’s right — the voice of 
Radio Free Bubblegum. You think 
you can do it?” 

“Like falling off a leap-pipe 
cinch.” 

Rachel giggled. “Show-off!” 
“Did I say something wrong?” 
Muldaur asked worriedly. 

R ain began to drum on the roof. 

Something’s been happening, 
Rachel thought to herself, I almost 
wish we had more time. Some- 
how . 

She looked around the room. 
Her things were piled by the wall. 

“What are you thinking about?” 
Muldaur asked. He had eaten 
several cans of tuna and a large 
salad. Now he was resting again on 
the bed. 

“I just remembered something,” 
she answered. “You’ll see in a 
minute.” She opened her flute case 
and fitted the sections together. 
“What is that?” 

“It’s called a flute. A musical in- 
strument. The flute is classified as 
a wind instrument, because I blow 
in here — ” 


“Ah.” Muldaur’s face lit up with 
comprehension. “A complex os- 
cillator of variable pitch. What 
tonal system do you — of course, the 
word tells me. Octave, eight. Pitch 
steps probably of — did I say some- 
thing wrong again?” 

“I see you paid attention in 
school.” 

“What does that mean?” 

“I was going to play you a few 
pieces, but — ” She started to pull 
the sections apart. 

“Don’t! I mean, do! Play!” Mul- 
daur make a quick gesture with his 
right hand. “Please, do play.” 

Rachel looked out the darkened 
window. “I’m sorry. It’s just that — 
okay. Let me think a minute.” She 
sat cross-legged on the floor, her 
right side turned to the bed. She 
tossed her hair back with a quick 
nod, then brought the flute halfway 
to her lips. She closed her eyes and 
frowned in thought. “This is a 
sonata by Telemann.” She took a 
hreath and began to play. Faint 
thunder sounded in the distance, 
and the wind blew across the roof. 
Rachel sat straight, her frown deep- 
ening as she reached the fast sec- 
tion of the sonata. She reached the 
end, paused only for a full breath, 
then went into a Mozart bourree. 
When that was done, she stopped, 
and muttered, “Mozart.” Muldaur 
had not moved or made a sound 
since she began playing. She 
nodded slightly, and Milhaud’s Pa- 
vanne for a Dead Princess. Then 
she began to tap her foot, and 


28 


IF 



played Flute Thing . The rhythm 
had her swaying gently by the end, 
and she went right into the Jeffer- 
son Airplane’s Cornin’ Back to Me, 
hearing the words in her mind. 
Sadness filled her, and flowed into 
the music, and her head was all but 
bowed when the last notes came. 
She let the flute drop from her lips, 
and sat silently for a while, listen- 
ing to the rain. 

44nr HANK you-” 

X Rachel sat up straight. “I 
don’t know what made me choose 
those pieces.” 

“Would you object if other 
people heard you playing?” 

“What do you mean?” 

Muldaur smiled. “I ask your per- 
mission to include your music in my 
report. And to make it available to 
the Music Libraries.” 

“But how?” 

“Memory,” he sakL tapping his 
forehead. “Storage, exact replay. 
We can work directly. Ersatz im- 
mortality.” 

“But it wasn’t that good!” 

“It is what I have.” 

Rachel was excited, yet uncer- 
tain. “Are you sure that’s what you 
want?” 

“If it will help, I would like to 
return the favor.” 

“How?” 

“It’s — hmm. It is a miracle of 
rare device. Where does that come 
from?” 

Her eyes widened. “That’s from 
a poem. Kubla Khan, by Cole- 


ridge. I haven’t read that in years!” 
“Is there more?” 

“Lots. Umm ... In Xanadu 
did — no, let me try the next to last 
stanza.” She folded her hands in 
her lap, and recited: 

A damsel with a dulcimer 
In a vision once I saw: 

It was an Abyssinian maid, 

And on her dulcimer she played, 
Singing of Mount Abora. 

Could I revive in me 
Her symphony and song, 

To such a deep delight ’twould 
win me. 

That— 

“Enough!” Muldaur had raised 
himself onto his elbows. “I’m sorry. 
You — it reminded me of someone. 
But I was about to explain. Would 
you like to go, ah, sightseeing?” 
“In this weather?” 

“No, that’s not what I mean. 
The — process that enabled me to 
learn your language. The tech- 
niques. If you are willing, it can go 
both ways.” 

“You’ll teach me Gutter Galac- 
tic?" 

“No. I can show you around in 
my memories. Places. Stars. Other 
peoples.” 

“Oh. Television.” 

“It’s more like — let it go. Here, 
sit close to me. Maybe if I sat up 
and you got on this side of the bed. 
Good. Fingers here. The hand-to- 
head contact is partly a mnemonic. 
Relax. This w ill be mostly memory, 
edited, we’ll be seeing through my 
eyes and so forth exactly as if I was

there again. Of course I can jump 
around or focus on certain parts.” 
Muldaur began running through 
the link exchanges. “Please con- 
centrate on your breathing as best 
you can, or on some sound. Every 
inward breath. Now think blue. 
The room is thinning now. Listen. 
Eyes closed. Listen.” He closed his 
eyes and went in, then reached out 
in the grayness until the bright- 
nesses touched. There. Hello. 

Hello? Bombardier to pilot? 

What? 

It's really happening! 

Yes. See, over there. That's 
where we're headed. Ready?" 

Ride 'em, cowboy. 

Muldaur assumed Rachel meant 
yes. Satisfied that her conscious 
was securely linked, he began to 
funnel toward certain memories. 

Here we go. I'm merging in, so 
we're both inside the memory- me, 
if you like. He/I is not aware of us. 

Of course. 

We' re only tracking external 
stimuli. Okay, we're in. 

Oh! 

C rimson sky hung overhead. 

Off to the sides floated orange- 
frame shapes of cloud-like texture, 
hollow, yet twirling. The ground 
was far below, a pale plain with 
windy gusts of white smoke 
spotting it. 

Those are the natives. Watch 
carefully now. 

A group of tinkertoy clouds 
drifted low', by the rippling shore of 


a translucent green. The smoke 
puffs rolled across the waters 
toward the cloud. As the edge of 
the cloud dipped in the waves, the 
green flowed up inside, carrying 
some of the smoke puffs with it. 
When the orange frame was filled 
with green, the entire structure 
floated away again, toward the 
plain. 

That’s their transport system. 

They remind me of dirigibles. It 
should say Goodyear on the side. 

What? Hang on, I’m skipping 
through. 

The w orld fell away in a series of 
flashes, and the stars came out. 
Unblinking specks in some un- 
graspable pattern, they shone while 
the dwindling world behind 
eclipsed the sun. A feeling of im- 
mensity overcame Rachel, as if she 
had melted into the fabric and was 
one with it. She felt motion as her 
body twisted, then mental move- 
ments which felt like swimming in 
air with phantom limbs. Lines of 
oars stroked from her sides, faster 
and faster, and then, like the ‘pop’ 
of a champagne bottle, she slipped 
into a new' region, where unchecked 
speed seemed beneath her atten- 
tion. Other senses spoke to her. She 
heard the muffled cries of fusing 
hydrpgen nuclei, each star calling 
out its own distinct melody. Plas- 
mas rolled and roared in the dis- 
tance. Strange animal-like motions 
zipped across her field of vision. 
She sailed the symphonic cosmos 
for untold eons, smiling upon it all,

even the sad browndark pools 
which sucked at her and tried to 
lure her to them with love. Then 
she felt a tug, as a kite feels the 
yank of its string, and she knew she 
was returning. The banshee wails 
ceased, to be replaced by the ever- 
burning stars. 

Here I am again, came Mul- 
daur’s unspoken voice. Having a 
good time? 

!!! 

This is Giddy gaddy, next. It will 
be clear why it is called that . 

Rachel felt a slowing down, and 
knew of the suns and planets ‘near- 
by,’ and not by eyesight. The closer 
the world came, the faster time 
seemed to flow. The globe was 
divided from pole to pole in colored 
crescents, and nine glowing moons 
orbited in off-center paths, whizz- 
ing madly by the fringes of the at- 
mosphere and trailing fiery tails. 

A traffic beam locked on an<J 
guided them down. I'm editing out 
the dull part. A black curtain fell 
and rose, and they were wafting 
down an endless rail on a field 
which encircled the body in an un- 
constraining net. Ahead of them, a 
quartet of birdlike mops whistled 
and hooted in syncopated twelve- 
tone. They’re arguing about where 
to eat lunch. Rachel was surround- 
ed by a panorama of whirling, 
dashing, skating, spewing, wheel- 
ing . the landscape was a carni- 
val of sentients in motion, all under 
their own power, chasing their 
diverse errands and doings in a 


complex dance which dizzied her. 
Why? she asked her guide. 

Rules, traditions, he replied. 
Quotas have replaced taxes here. 
Only transients and tourists such as 
us are exempt. With a thought, 
they detached from the touring rail 
and floated toward a golden honey- 
combed mountain. At a blue ring 
they slowed and tossed a coin at the 
attendant, a basketball with legs 
and a graceful neck which sup- 
ported a single goggle-eyed head 
with a beak that grabbed and 
swallowed the coin. Passing 
through the hoop, they were gently 
seized and directed to a small 
throng of clothed humanoids inside 
one of the honeycombs. A pleasant 
vibration filled the air, and a sweet 
perfume came from the floor. The 
people all stood around as if they 
were about to dance. 

This wouldn't make sense, Mul- 
daur said. Last stop, Third Green. 

She was standing, overlooking a 
valley. To the left, a vast pillar of 
falling water roared, dropping and 
cascading on the rocks far below. 
The pillar flowed from the moun- 
tain behind, which rose with brown 
and green crags into the clouds. 
The valley held fields of pale orange 
trees, tall thin shoots that moved 
with the wind. There were plains 
like fresh-plowed earth, and 
jumbled masses of colored birdlike 
fluffs that circled above large blue 
spheres that rested in the fields. 
This is a nature preserve. Visited 
but not lived on. 


STORMY WEATHER

It's beautiful. 

Watch. 

The sun fell rapidly as Muldaur 
edited, and the sky turned to flame. 
The bird fluffs rose toward the 
glow. Shafts of light shot through 
the water and bent with the flow, 
glittering at the waterfall’s base 
with prismatic splendor. The 
clouds blew away and the mountain 
was crowned with stars. 

Meteors began to fall, etching 
white scars on the night. The sky 
wheeled, and a pale rainbow curved 
across the heavens. The water 
glowed a phosphorescent gold. The 
rainbow folded under the horizon 
beyond the valley and, on the other 
side of the mountain, sunrise came. 
The plains were damp with soft 
greens, and the blue stones covered 
with sleeping multicolored fluffs. 
The sky lightened, and the plains 
blossomed to greet the light. Large 
beasts stirred, lumbering from tree 
to tree in search of food. The fluffs 
began circling again. Day had 
come. 

M uldaur dropped his hands 
from Rachel’s forehead. 
“That was — incredible!" she 
breathed. “Thank you.” 

“I am glad you liked it.” 

“I — well, if you think that evens 
the score, I won’t argue.” 

“Good.” 

Rachel stretched, “I think I’m 
tired. You going to try and cut out 
tomorrow?” 

“With luck.” 


Rachel looked around. “We 
didn’t figure out sleeping arrange- 
ments yet.” 

“I will be going into trance soon, 
so it does not matter. I can sit on 
the floor for the night.” Muldaur 
began to stand up. Rachel could 
see the flashes of pain in his face. 

“You’re staying here,” she said. 
“Don’t argue.” 

“What about you?” 

She looked around. 

“The bed is wide enough,” Mul- 
daur said. “I am not sure what 
might offend you. But I will be un- 
conscious.” 

Rachel tried not to feel insulted. 
That’s ridiculous, she told herself. 
Why not? It made sense. This 
wasn’t her dorm, anyway, with 
everyone watching and prying and 
keeping score. “Thank you,” she 
said. “I will.” 

T he storm grew in intensity, and 
peal after peal of thunder burst 
over the valley. Muldaur was deep 
in his trance by the time Rachel 
changed into her bedclothes. He 
had kept his tunic or whatever it 
was on, although his smooth-sur- 
faced boots stood on the floor by 
the wall. Rachel paused for. a 
moment, biting her lip, then lay 
face down next to Muldaur. She 
squirmed around trying to get com- 
fortable, and ended up with her 
right arm hanging off the edge of 
the bed. After much hesitation, she 
draped the other arm across Mul- 
daur’s chest, and hoped the

pressure wouldn’t hurt him. 

He seemed not to notice when 
she touched him. 

Muldaur had withdrawn, and 
was making “corrections” in his 
body. Time was stretched, and his 
concern encompassed myriads of 
parallel processes forced into ac- 
complishment ahead of their spon- 
taneous wont. Cells divided, repair- 
ed, transformed. Fields shifted in- 
side, and hovered at the surface. 
He was vaguely aware of Rachel’s 
getting on the mattress next to him, 
and saw a faint blueness where her 
arm lay on his chest. Then the buzz 
from her conscious faded, and she 
turned to dreams. Muldaur went 
back to work, satisfied that she was 
sound asleep. 

His injuries were healing nicely 
when the clamor in Rachel’s brain 
caught his attention. He turned, 
and was hit by waves of fright and 
running. Still inside and in slowed- 
time, Muldaur shifted control to 
the automatic level and set a watch- 
dog twitch, then turned upwards 
and let time speed up. He grew 
aware of Rachel’s arm tight around 
his chest. Then he was back and 
awake, and leaned over to grasp 
her far shoulder in his hand. 
“Rachel! Wake ujJ!” He shook her 
until she rocked back and forth. 
She lifted her face up from the 
pillow. 

“Wha — ” Her arm relaxed on his 
chest. 

“You were having a bad dream,” 
he explained. “I woke you.” 


She moved closer to him. “What 
did you — ” 

“Nothing.” He let his arm rub 
her back. “Just woke you.” 

“Oh.” Still sleepy, she moved 
her body half on top of him. “They 
were chasing me.” 

Muldaur was unsure what to do. 
It had been some time since he had 
been with a person this young and 
in need. Should he merge and re- 
direct the dreams? Trigger her 
sexual pleasure centers? It was 
simple enough to induce orgasm. 
He didn’t have the strength to 
make love, even if Rachel wanted 
to. That was strange; he could 
sense part of her wanting, and 
other dark pre- voices forbidding 
her. But that was not his business. 
He frowned and held her against 
him, chanting silent soulguides un- 
til she relaxed back into sleep. Be- 
fore he returned to his work, he 
touched her forehead, and brought 
back dreams of her voyage through 
his mind. 

R achel woke slowly, rolling onto 
her back and letting her dreams 
fade slowly. A well-rested feeling 
filled her. She threw off the sleep- 
ing bag — it had not been that cold, 
so the unzipped bag had served as a 
blanket — and went to wash her 
face. She watched herself in the 
mirror as she brushed back her 
hair. She hadn’t felt this happy 
in — Rachel frowned suddenly. How 
long? She almost would have taken 
this good feeling for granted. How

much a zombie had she made her- 
self in the dorm? What had made 
her run away? 

She found a peasant blouse and 
shorts, and put them on. Barefoot, 
she went outside looking for Mul- 
daur. Matty's coming today. And 
Muldaur is leaving. 

The field was full of cows. Near- 
by, Muldaur sat on a tree stump, 
cross-legged and arms extended. 
The shimmering she had first seen 
when she found him was thicker, 
more active. The trees beyond him 
seemed to blur. As she walked 
along the stream toward him she 
saw the phantom outline shoot up 
and out like a frog’s tongue. She 
didn’t know whether or not it was 
safe to disturb him. 

“Hello, Rachel,’’ Muldaur 
called. “It’s okay. This won’t hurt 
you.” 

She stepped through the stream. 
As she came closer the hairs on her 
arms and legs began to stand up, 
and her mouth began to tingle. 

“How long have you been out 
here?” she asked. 

“Dawn.” 

“Oh. What are you doing?” 

Muldaur pointed to the south. 
“The broadcast is over there. I 
don’t think you can see them, but 
my “wings” are, well, unfolded 
about two miles on each side. I 
can’t do much with them in that 
position, but they’re acting well 
enough as power receptors. What 
you do see is the “web.” I guess 
you’d call it a space suit, except it’s 


as much part of me as my arms and 
legs.” 

“How do you eat and breath?” 
“You mean, why don’t I carry 
quantities of food and water and air 
with me?” 

“Something like that.” 

Muldaur turned his head without 
relaxing his arms as Rachel sat 
down. “They teach us — I create a 
self-contained minimal ecosystem. 
Which means, if you don’t throw 
anything out, you’ve got enough. I 
have enough energy and control to 
remetabolize everything. In fact, I 
don’t really breathe while in flight; 
I sort of continually hold my breath 
and break the carbon dioxide and 
water and wastes back down while 
they’re still in my body.” 

“Oh. I’m not sure I’d like that.” 
“But out there is nothing. I can’t 
need anything I don’t have on me 
when I’m in nether-space.” 

Rachel remembered sailing 
through the stars. “But doesn’t it 
get lonely?” 

“Yes.” 

M uldaur shifted his arms a bit 
and became covered with 
sparks. “This is harmless,” he 
said. “I’m making it visible so you 
can watch.” 

“So you’re leaving soon.” 

“Tavo hours.” 

“Do you have to go?” Rachel 
stood up and stepped closer to Mul- 
daur. “Will I ever see you again?” 
“It is unlikely. I’m sorry.” The 
skin of sparks began to roll from 


34 


IF 



one arm to the other. “Rachel, why 
did you come out here? Before I got 
here?” 

She turned away. “Because I was 
afraid.” 

“Of what?” 

She turned and sat again, arms 
around her folded legs, and stared 
at the stump he was perched on.*“It 
was people, I guess. Everybody 
seemed to want something from 
me, and I thought there wouldn’t 
be anything left. Or- that they 
wouldn’t like me if I didn’t do it 
right, and I had no idea what to 
do.” She bowed her head between 
her knees. “And I wasn’t sure, I 
didn’t feel I knew anybody well 
enough, everybody else seemed to 
be having fun, but I wasn’t sure I — 
1 didn’t want to commit myself un- 
til I was certain it was safe.” 
“And?” 

“I couldn’t take it. Everybody 
seemed to be demanding all at 
once, and I wanted it to stop.” 
“Did it?” 

“I don’t know. 1 left.” > 

"Then why did you help me?” 
She looked up. “But — but I had 
to. You were hurt." 

“Even so.” 

She hugged her arms. “I guess it 
was because no one was looking.” 
“Does that matter?” 

“1 thought it did. Doesn’t it?” 
“Would you believe me if I said it 
doesn’t?” 

“I’m not sure.” 

“Then you have to decide for 
yourself.” 


She stood up. “Don’t leave until 
I get back. I’m going for a walk.” 

Rachel pushed away a low 
branch to keep it from hitting her 
face. How had she come to care for, 
Muldaur? Because it wasn't real. 
And I knew he’d be going away. 
Helping an unconscious body was 
no more dangerous than putting a 
fledgling back in the nest — but 
when she was being watched ... 

Graded. Judged. Were other 
people’s opinions so important? So 
important that she had to decide 
what to do on the basis of what 
people would think of her? 

A squirrel ran by her. She 
whistled, and it dashed up a nearby 
tree, hanging four feet off the 
ground and watching her. Does his 
opinion matter? O f course not. 

A yellow-and-black butterfly 
settled on a patch of moss. Does 
she care what I think? And would 
her worrying change my thoughts. 
The butterfly folded her wings to- 
gether, spread them flat, and 
fluttered away. Why should I be 
different? 

She touched her hand to the 
trunk of a white pine. The bark was 
peeling off in smooth curls. I'm as 
good as they are. And they don’t 
seem to worry what / think. 

The ground squished underfoot 
as she ran back to Muldaur. 

H e.was standing, bathed in fire. 
“You’re going!” she cried. 

“It is time,” he said. The air 
around him flashed with color.

“But I want you to stay!’’ 

“I would have to leave sometime, 
Rachel. And I am overdue.’’ The 
aurora dimmed. “I wish I could 
stay. I believe I owe you my life, 
and thank you. I will not forget. 
Remember, somewhere your music 
will be known. There is no one else 
on this planet who can claim that.” 
She stepped through the fire and 
hugged him. “That doesn’t matter. 
Oh, I’m sorry I’m the way I am.” 
“Don’t be.” 

“All right. Will you stop here 
again?” 

“I don’t know. What will happen 
when your planet is registered as 
undeterminable. You will probably 
be quarantined in a few years. 
Maybe some /Civil servant will keep 
an eye on you.” He touched the 
sides of her nose. “My time is not 
the same as yours. It would be un- 
fair to promise.” 

“I suppose. Remember me.” 

“I will. Here, close your eyes.” 
Rachel did so, and felt a fast blur 
of colors roll in. 

“There. My final gift. A small re- 
payment for what you have done.” 
“What is it?” 

“Pleasant dreams. Now I must 
go-” 

Rachel hugged him once more. 
He touched his lips to hers, and 
they looked in one another’s eyes. 
Then he let his arms drop, and 
Rachel stepped back. 

“Goodbye,” he said. “Good- 
bye.” 

“Fly away, bluebird, take your 


broken wings and learn to fly.” She 
began to wave, wishing for confetti 
to throw. 

The glow sprang back to its fully 
glory. Muldaur looked at her once 
more, then walked toward the edge 
of the mountain. The trees beyond 
shone green, gold, purple and red. 
He spread his arms and stepped off 
the edge. The fire stretched out; he 
did not fall. Then he looked up, 
and began to rise. One hand 
waved. Soon he was a bird, then a 
glowing star, and finally gone. 
Rachel ceased waving, and stared 
at the sky. 

44 f f bY, Rach, you almost 

already *° g°?” 

“Matty!” 

“I asked, are you ready to go 
back? I’ve got a term paper to 
finish. The road got rained out, 
and I had to go a different way. 
Hey, you really look good! I guess I 
was right in bringing you here, 
wasn’t I?” 

Rachel smiled sadly. “It’s just 
hard to leave here.” 

“I know, it’s so pretty here. Were 
you watching the birds? I didn’t see 
anything in that direction. Look, 
there’s a bluejay over by the dog- 
wood. They’re so graceful. Some- 
times I wish I was a bird, just so I 
could fly. Even a sparrow. 
Wouldn’t you?” 

“I don’t know.” Rachel looked 
up one last time. “Flying’s a differ- 
ent sort of life. Just being me will 
do for now.” •

entertained, it has predicted much of 
the far-ranging scientific and social 
change now upon us. 

In GALAXY, the finest authors of 
the genre continue to speculate, to 
predict, to tackle the prime problems 
already shaping tomorrow. Ecology-

LESTER DEL REY 


T his is the last book review 
column I shall be writing for IF. 
And while 1 am saddened by the 
fact that the magazine will no 
longer have an independent exist- 
ence, I feel that it may well be time 
for my own efforts of this sort to 
draw to a close. I’ve been reviewing 
now for slightly over five years, and 
inevitably some of the fine edge of 
enthusiasm begins to fade with re- 
peated efforts. 

I suspect that some of the vitriol 
is lacking in my attacks upon books 
which I consider bad enough to de- 
serve public censure. And likewise, 
some of the joy has disappeared in 
my praise of those books which 
should be read by the audience to 
whom I appeal. 

This is always the problem of a 
professional attempting to speak 
for those who do not have a profes- 
sional interest in any field. Impres- 
sions begin to formalize into a sort 
of code, and in time the code be- 
comes less flexible than it should 


be, so that new and fresh impres- 
sions cannot stand by themselves, 
but must somehow be fitted into 
that body of rules. A man may 
know that the rules are nothing but 
the summation of impressions, yet 
still find it hard to throw his mind 
open fully to new impressions. 

There is a great deal of difference 
between criticism and reviewing, of 
course. The whole purpose of 
reviewing is opposed to that of criti- 
cism. A critic basically examines a 
work to find new insight for those 
who have already read that work. 
He sees beyond the first impres- 
sion, he relates the work to other 
works, and to the whole body of 
mankind’s development within the 
field and those related to it. 

A reviewer should probably be 
called a previewer. His job is to give 
as accurate a first reading as pos- 
sible, and then to pass on his im- 
pressions to those who have not 
read the work. If he is honest, he 
attempts to examine his standards 


38 



and inform his readers as to what 
those standards are, so that they 
may judge his reviews according to 
their own standards, and determine 
how far they can follow him. Then, 
within the limits of his own taste, 
he attempts to advise the readers as 
to whether this is a book that they 
should read. 

I’ve attempted to do this by the 
introductions that have preceded 
most of my reviews, in which I have 
outlined many of the criteria (so far 
as any man can determine his own 
criteria) that lie behind my re- 
actions to books. And I’ve tried to 
approach each book afresh, as a 
normal reader might. 

But inevitably, the fact that I’ve 
been reading the book to review it 
creeps into my judgment. As a 
casual reader, I can pass over sec- 
tions that I hesitate about as a re- 
viewer — simply because those sec- 
tions make for excellent lines in a 
review. And as time goes on, and as 
I’ve found too many cases where 
the point I want to make has al- 
ready been made often in the past, 
I develop far too much interest in 
the review, too little in the book it- 
self. 

Thus jaded after five years of 
reading, I feel that a long rest and a 
return to reading as it should be 
done is highly desirable. I’ve said 
much of what I wanted to say. And 
it’s time to stop. In fact, I believe 
that I might have done better to 
stop a year or so ago. Reviewing, 
like writing or reading, should be 


an act of total enthusiasm temper- 
ed with only the correct measure of 
judgment. When the judgment in 
any field far exceeds the enthu- 
siasm, the results suffer. 

B ut I deeply regret that the 
cause of my termination should 
be the last issue of a magazine I’ve 
admired over a period of more than 
twenty years. There are too few 
good magazines left to us, and the 
loss of one is a painful thing to 
contemplate. 

This was not so when IF began, 
back in March of 1952. This was 
during the greatest boom that 
science fiction magazine publishing 
has known. I forget how many 
magazines there were-^-somewhere 
between thirty and forty. Most of 
the new ones were pretty shoddy 
affairs, of course. Their rates were 
often low, their editors far too often 
had no knowledge of science fic- 
tion — or of editing in too many 
cases. And they were started only 
because the distributors wanted 
more of the action and suggested to 
some publisher or other that he too 
should do science fiction. 

I was part of that boom. At one 
time, I edited four magazines of 
fantasy and science fiction. Nobody 
in the publishing house had any 
idea of fiction magazine contents, 
much less of science fiction. But the 
distributor wanted such magazines 
and was willing to advance the 
money (at a sizable cut in the price 
paid to the publisher). 


39 



James Quinn, who began IF, ad- 
mitted he knew little about science 
fiction. But he differed from most 
of those transitory publishers in 
having a long background in pulp 
magazines. He respected his 
readers, and he liked a good story 
more than an important name on 
bad fiction that had been rejected 
by all the knowledgeable editors. 
He was an honest and very decent 
man, aware of his ignorance of the 
field of science fiction, but deter- 
mined to bring out a good maga- 
zine and to treat his authors fairly. 
(1 met him only once, but that was 
enough to develop a strong liking 
and respect.) 

I f iim quinn had begun when 
there were less magazines to use 
up the limited money the readers 
could spend and the limited 
number of good stories the authors 
could supply, I believe he would 
have turned IF into one of the best 
magazines in the field. Even with 
the difficulties of the time, he made 
it far better than most of the others 
that began after F&SF and Galaxy. 
He paid good rates, bought good 
stories (though few memorable 
ones, since those went to the top 
three magazines), and made his 
magazine one of the most attractive 
in the field. His 1953 wraparound 
covers are still some of the most 
attractive ones ever done. He also 
began to develop an understanding 
of and love for science fiction. 
Unfortunately, perhaps, he was 


still very conscious of his lack of 
background. To remedy that, he 
turned to others who might know 
the field better. He approached me 
with a handsome offer to edit the 
magazine, but I made my biggest 
mistake by deciding not to leave the 
publisher with whom I was already 
associated. But he found a knowl- 
edgeable man indeed in Larry 
Shaw, who was an old-time fan 
with considerable experience in 
judging manuscripts. 

This should have worked well, 
but didn’t for two reasons. The 
major reason was that suddenly 
American News — the biggest dis- 
tributor of magazines, then or 
ever — went out of the distributing 
business, leaving the field in tur- 
moil that lasted for years. This 
killed many of the magazines, and 
seriously harmed the success of IF. 

T he second reason is only 
opinion on my part, but I be- 
lieve it is valid. Larry Shaw saw the 
magazine quite differently from the 
view Jim Quinn had of it. Where 
Quinn wanted simply good story 
values by pulp standards, Larry felt 
it should have prestige stories that 
would start fan discussions, upset 
taboos, and generally be controver- 
sial. He got some of those stories, 
too. He ran Malice in Wonderland, 
a story about a drug-world future, 
at a time when most readers knew 
nothing of the drugs that were to 
fill endless stories ten years later. 
He took A Case of Conscience, 


40 


IF 



whicji was a complex and dense 
story with a philosophical base; I 
had previously rejected it only be- 
cause Jim Blish wasn’t ready to do a 
sequel to tie down the philosophical 
end that was only partly resolved in 
the story. 

Those controversial stories were 
good, in themselves. But the 
readers who had followed the 
magazine for the pure story value 
Quinn had given were not adjusted 
to Shaw’s brand of science fiction; 
and the new readers attracted by 
Shaw were dissatisfied with much 
of the rest of the magazine. The two 
characteristics could have been 
blended in time, but the alteration 
was too rapid. 

Eventually, Shaw was replaced 
by Damon Knight. But again, the 
vision Damon had of the magazine 
was different from that of Jim 
Quinn. And finally, in a failing 
market, IF ran into difficulties. Its 
brief period of monthly publication 
from 1954 to 1955 had already 
ended. And in February 1959, the 
magazine stopped publishing. It 
had far outlasted most of its boom- 
time rivals, however, and it was still 
basically an interesting magazine. 

R obert guinn saw its potential. 

He had been the publisher of 
Galaxy for most of that magazine’s 
existence. Now he felt that a second 
magazine with a different approach 
to the market would be desirable. 
His editor, Horace Gold, also 
wanted a place where the good 


stories he received which were not 
quite right for Galaxy could be 
used. So IF didn’t die; it missed 
one bi-monthly issue, but was back 
on the stands with the July 1959 
issue as a sister to Galaxy. 


I ooking back with hindsight, it’s 
j easy to say that Gold never 
quite established a true character 
for the magazine. This was a period 
when most of the action science 
fiction magazines — the younger- 
oriented, adventure-slanted ones 
like Planet Stories — had gone off 
the market. At the time, that 
probably seemed like a clear warn- 
ing that such magazines were not 
wanted; but hindsight suggests that 
IF perhaps should have been the 
magazine to fill the gap, since we’ve 
since come to miss the type of fic- 
tion that drew many fans into the 
field originally. In any event, Gold 
never quite found what he wanted, 
but tended to treat IF as a place to 
unload the stories that were not 
quite up to or right for the Galaxy 
standards. 

At the time, Gold was quite ill, 
and found the task of editing grow- 
ing increasingly difficult. He finally 
resigned in 1962, and the maga- 
zines fell to the editorship of 
Frederik Pohl. 

Pohl gave IF a good deal of fresh 
character. One of his innovations 
was the policy of publishing at least 
one story by a new writer in each 
issue. This led to the discovery of 


READING ROOM 


41 



some of the best of the new writers; 
and their loyalty to Pohl added a 
great deal to the quality of writing 
to be found in both magazines. 

He was also able to go back to a 
monthly schedule of publishing in 
late 1964. This again made IF a 
major magazine in the field. It’s 
possible, of course, to publish 
serials in a bi-monthly magazine, 
but they lose most of their impact 
between issues. Yet in many ways, 
novels that appear serially establish 
the basic reputation of a magazine. 

The results of Pohl’s editing can 
be seen in one simple fact. IF won 
the Hugo award as the best profes- 
sional science fiction magazine /for 
1966, 1967, and 1968 — three con- 
secutive years. This was against 
magazines that had long been con- 
sidered the only possible contenders 
for that award. 


F rederik pohl had originally 
intended to make Galaxy into 
the best possible science fiction 
magazine, and the success of IF 
must have been somewhat surpris- 
ing and a little puzzling. He had in- 
tended IF for a somewhat younger 
and slightly less sophisticated 
audience — and then discovered 
that even the sophisticated reader 
liked to relax in pure enjoyment of 
science fiction. Somehow, the 
magazine had begun to find a char- 
acter of its own as Pohl discovered 
what he wanted it to be, and the 
readers obviously liked it. 


Then the magazines had to be 
sold. This was not the result of cir- 
culation difficulties, as most 
readers thought, but because of 
certain legal angles concerning the 
way in which a company can “go 
public” with its stock, resulting 
from other interests of Robert 
Guinn. In any event, UPD took 
over Galaxy and IF. 

And now there was another 
editor in the long list of those who 
had served IF. Ejler Jakobsson was 
employed by UPD at the time and 
he had a background of editing 
other science fiction magazines 
during the boom period, so he was 
chosen. (It was then that it was de- 
cided not to have me continue the 
science column I had been doing, 
but to turn to book reviewing.) 

Inevitably, the character chang- 
ed. No honest editqr can or should 
try to imitate another. He must es- 
tablish his own character through 
the magazine, or it will have no 
character. 

At the time of the change-over, 
there were to be four magazines. In 
addition to Galaxy and IF, there 
was to be regular publication of 
Worlds of Tomorrow and Worlds 
of Fantasy , with perhaps another 
later. That was simply too much 
work for any single editor, particu- 
larly one who was expected to do 
his work in a business office where 
every worry of a large publishing 
company obtruded on his time. 
(Later Jakobsson managed to do 
his work at home, but much of the 


42 


IF 



pattern had been set by then.) Try- 
ing to establish a separate char- 
acter for four magazines is 
difficult, as I know by experience, 
and I don’t think it can be done at 
once; each must have time to 
develop by itself before another can 
be shaped. 

I suppose it was inevitable that 
IF again became something of a 
second sister to Galaxy — which re- 
mained the prestige magazine in 
the minds of the readers, even when 
they were giving the Hugo to IF\ (I 
have large suspicions that what 
many readers seem to feel they 
should like and what they really 
like are not the same; a pity, be- 
cause what they really enjoy is 
usually better.) Under an impos- 
sible load of work and the haste of 
transition, I feel that IF again be- 
came a place where manuscripts 
not quite right for Galaxy were 
published. 

Then the decision was made to 
put IF back on a bi-monthly 
schedule, despite a slowly climbing 
circulation. And that somehow 
made it seem again like a lesser 
magazine — whether it was or not. I 
personally think it deserved better 
treatment. 

Jakobsson eventually found 
carrying both magazines more 
work than he was willing to do — 
complicated as it was by other diffi- 
culties and his growing feeling that 
he wanted to retire. And IF was 
handed over to Jim Baen, who had 
been serving as Managing Editor.

again looking back with hind- 
sight, I wish that change had 
come earlier. Baen, I feel, was the 
right editor for the magazine. He 
began with every possible handi- 
cap, since he had to depend on 
manuscripts which were not con- 
sidered right for Galaxy. But he be- 
gan with the very great advantage 
of treating IF as a potentially good 
magazine in its own right. He 
wanted it to be different from the 
more “sophisticated” magazines, 
to bring out the stories that were 
fun to read, to do the things that 
the field (other than in recent 
books) has been missing for too 
many years. 

He brought the needed effort to 
IF, and mapped out the needed 
character of its own. He gave it a 
fresh style, with new artists to give 
it variety, and he has been working 
with writers to get the kind of ma- 
terial it deserves. I don’t think he 
has fully succeeded, but from my 
talks with him and from comments 
by readers on what has been ac- 
complished, I feel he was just be- 
ginning to succeed. 

And now the magazine is at the 
end of its independent existence. 
The exigencies of publishing in a 
market of wildly increasing prices 
and erratic distribution have ap- 
parently forced this termination. I 
find it a sorry end to a magazine 
that has contributed a great deal to 
the field in twenty-two years — and 
which could have contributed a 
great deal more. 


Still, I have not wholly given in to 
despair. I’ve heard that this marks 
the beginning of the end for maga- 
zines — but I don’t believe it; there 
are too many valuable contribu- 
tions that only the magazines can 
make to the field for readers ever to 
let them vanish. 

Some day, I hope to see IF back 
on the stands. And I hope when I 
do that there will be new writers in 
it as well as old, new artists and old 
friends. I’d like to see again the 
aliens from Vega and maybe a gor- 
geous princess from far Fomalhaut 
on the arm of a rocket man — and I 
wouldn’t mind a touch of space tan 
to him, nor be disappointed to see 
that he had shaggy ears! I’d like to 
hear the little bells the women wear 
beside the canals in the old towns of 
Mars. And I’d like to find the 
stories that I can’t describe until 
some new writer thinks of them. 

As for myself, I’m glad to have 
had this chance to bring you my 
opinions of books and science 
fiction in general. I’m grateful to 
those who wrote me to express their 
opinions, and doubly-grateful to 
Ejler Jakobsson and Jim Baen for 
letting me sound off without 
tampering with my views. 

Being a reviewer was fun while it 
lasted, and some day I may try v it 
again. But for now, let me simply 
sit in the Reading Room with the 
rest of you. 

Now where did I put that latest 
book by Leigh Brackett? .

Time Deer 


45 




For the old man, and the 
young man he was, past, present 
and future became One. 


CRAIG STRETE 


T he old man watched the boy. 

The boy watched the deer. The 
deer was watched by all, and the 
Great Being above. 

The old man remembered when 
he was a young boy and his father 
showed him a motorcycle thing on a 
parking lot. 

The young boy remembered his 
second life with some regret, not 
looking forward to the coming of 
his first wife. 

Tuesday morning the Monday 
morning traffic jam was three days 
old. The old man sat on the hood of 
a stalled car and watched the boy. 
The boy watched the deer. The deer 
was watched by all and the Great 
Being above. 

The young boy resisted when his 
son, at the insistence of his bitch of 
a white wife, had tried to put him in 
a rest home for the elderly. Now he 
watched a deer beside the highway. 
And was watched in turn. 

The old man was on the way to 
somewhere. He was going some- 


place, someplace important, he for- 
got just where. But he knew he was 
going. 

The deer had relatives waiting 
for her, grass waiting for her, sea- 
sons being patient on her account. 
As much as she wanted to please 
the boy by letting him look at her, 
she had to go. She apologized with 
a shake of her head. 

The old man watched the deer 
going. He knew she had someplace 
to go, someplace important. He did 
not know where she was going but 
he knew why. 

The old man was going to be 
late. He could have walked. He was 
only going across the road. He was 
going across the road to get to the 
other side. He was going to be late 
for his own funeral. The old man 
was going someplace. He couldn’t 
remember where. 

££T'vid you make him wear the 
I f watch? If he’s wearing the 
watch he should — ”

“He’s an old man, honey! His 
mind wanders,” said Frank Strong 
Bull. 

“Dr. Amber is waiting! Does he 
think we can afford to pay for every 
appointment he misses?” snarled 
Sheila, running her fingers through 
the tangled ends of her hair. 
“Doesn’t he ever get anywhere on 
time?” 

“He lives by Indian time. Being 
late is just something you must ex- 
pect from — ” he began, trying to 
explain. 

She cut him off. “Indian this and 
Indian that! I’m so sick of your god 
damn excuses I could vomit!” 

“But—” 

“Let’s just forget it. We don’t 
have time to argue about it. We 
have to be at the doctor’s office in 
twenty minutes. If we leave now we 
can just beat the rush hour traffic. I 
just hope your father’s there when 
we arrive.” 

“Don’t worry. He’ll be there,” 
said Frank, looking doubtful. 


B ut the deer could not leave. 

She went a little distance and 
then turned and came back. And 
the old man was moved because he 
knew the deer had come back be- 
cause the boy knew how to look at 
the deer. 

And the boy was happy because 
the deer chose to favor him. And he 
saw the deer for what she was. 
Great and golden and quick in her 
beauty. 


And the deer knew that the boy 
thought her beautiful. For it was 
the purpose of the deer in this 
world on that morning to be beauti- 
ful for a young boy to look at. 

And the old man who was going 
someplace was grateful to the deer 
and almost envious of the boy. But 
he was one with the boy who was 
one with the deer and they were all 
one with the Great Being above. So 
there was no envy, just the great 
longing of age for youth. 

ttnr hat son of a bitch!” growled 
Frank Strong Bull. “The 
bastard cut me off.” He yanked the 
gear shift out of fourth and 
slammed it into third. The tach 
needle shot into the red and the 
mustang backed off, just missing 
the foreign car that had swerved in 
front of it. 

“Oh Christ— We’ll be late!” 
muttered Sheila, turning in the car 
seat to look out the back window. 
“Get into the express lane.” 

“Are you kidding? With this 
traffic?” 

His hands gripped the wheel like 
a weapon. He lifted his right hand 
and slammed the gear shift. Gears 
ground, caught hold and the Mus- 
tang shot ahead. Yanking the 
wheel to the left, he cut in front of a 
truck, which hit its brakes, missing 
the mustang by inches. He buried 
the gas pedal and the car respond- 
ed. He pulled up level with the 
sports car that had cut him off. He 
honked and made an obscene ges- 


47 



ture as he passed. Sheila squealed 
with delight. “Go! Go!” she ex 
claimed. 

T he old man had taken liber- 
ties in his life. He’d had things 
to remember and things he wanted 
to forget. Twice he had married. 

The first time. He hated the first 
time. He’d been blinded by her 
looks and his hands had got the 
better of him. He had not known 
his own heart and not knowing, he 
had let his body decide. It was 
something he would always regret. 

That summer he was an eagle. 
Free. Mating in the air. Never 
touching down. Never looking 
back. That summer. His hands 
that touched her were wings. And 
he flew and the feathers covered the 
scars that grew where their bodies 
had touched. 

He was of the air and she was of 
the earth. She muddied his dreams. 
She had woman’s body but lacked 
woman’s spirit. A star is a stone to 
the blind. She saw him through 
cripplied eyes. $he possessed. He 
shared. There was no life between 
them. He saw the stars and counted 
them one by one into her hand, that 
gift that all lovers share. She saw 
stones. And she turned away. 

He was free because he needed. 
She was a prisoner because she 
wanted. One day she was gone. 
And he folded his wings and the 
earth came rushing at him and he 
was an old man with a small son. 
And he lived in a cage and was 


three years dead. And his son was a 
small hope that melted. He was his 
mother’s son. He could see that in 
his son’s eyes. It was something the 
old man would always regret. 

But the deer, the young boy, 
these were things he would never 
regret. 

D r. amber was hostile. “Damn 
it! Now look — I can’t sign the 
commitment papers if I’ve never 
seen him.” 

Sheila tried to smile pleasantly. 
“He’ll show up. His hotel room is 
just across the street. Frank will 
find him. Don’t worry.” 

“I have other patients! I can’t be 
held up by some doddering old 
man,” snapped Dr. Amber. 

“Just a few more minutes,” 
Sheila pleaded. 

“You’ll have to pay for two visits. 
I can’t run this place for free. Every 
minute I’m not working, I’m losing 
money.” 

“We’ll pay,” said Sheila grimly. 
“We’ll pay.” 

T he world was big and the deer 
had to take her beauty through 
the world. She had been beautiful 
in one place for one boy on one 
morning of this world. It was time 
to be someplace else. The deer 
turned and fled into the woods, 
pushing her beauty before her into 
the world. 

The young boy jumped to his 
feet. His heart racing, his feet 
pounding, he tan after her with the 


48 


IF 



abandon of youth that is caring. He 
chased beauty through the world 
and disappeared from the old 
man’s sight in the depths of the 
forest. 

And the old man began dream- 
ing that — 

F rank Strong Bull’s hand 
closed on his shoulder and his 
son shook him, none too gently. 

The old man looked into' the face 
of his son and did not like what he 
saw. He allowed himself to be led to 
the doctor’s office. 

“Finally,” said Sheila. “Where 
the hell was he?” 

Dr. Amber came into the room 
with a phony smile. “Ah! The elu- 
sive one appears! And how are we 
today?” 

"We are fine,” said the old man, 
bitterly. He pushed the outstretch- 
ed stethoscope away from his chest. 

“Fiesty isn’t he,” observed Dr. 
Amber. 

“Let’s just get this over with,” 
said Sheila. “It’s been drawn out 
long enough as it is.” 

“Not sick,” said the old man. 
“You leave me alone.” He made 
two fists and backed away from the 
doctor. 

“How old is he?” asked Dr. 
Amber, looking at the old man’s 
wrinkled face and white hair. 

“Past eighty, at least,” said his 
son. “The records aren’t available 
and he can’t remember himself.” 
“Over eighty, you say. Well, 
that’s reason enough +Uc ;n,” said 


Dr. Amber. “Let me give him a 
cursory examination, just a for- 
mality, and then I’ll sign the 
papers.” 

The old man unclenched his 
fists. He looked at his son. His eyes 
burned. He felt neither betrayed 
nor wronged. He felt only sorrow. 
He allowed one tear, only qne tear, 
to fall. It was for his son who could 
not meet his eyes. 

And for the first time since his 
son had married' her, his eyes fell 
upon his son’s wife’s eyes. She 
seemed to shrivel under his gaze, 
but she met his gaze and he read 
the dark things in her eyes. 

They were insignificant, not truly 
a part of his life. He had seen the 
things of importance. He had 
watched the boy. The boy had 
watched the deer. And the deer had 
been watched by all and the Great 
Being above. 

The old man backed away from 
them until his back was against a 
wall. He put his hand to his chest 
and smiled. He was dead before his 
body hit the floor.

Dr. Amber nodded. 

The attendant approached them. 

“It’s better this way,” said

reason to live, no — ’’ 

“Where you want I should take 
the body?” asked the attendant. 

“Vale’s Funeral Home,” said 
Sheila. 

Frank Strong Bull stared straight 
ahead. He heard nothing. His eyes 
were empty of things, light and 
dark. 

“Where is it?’’ asked the 
attendant. 

“Where is what?’’ asked Dr. 
Amber. 

“The body? Where’s the body?” 

“It’s in the next room. Oh the

around his desk. He took the 
attendant’s arm and led him away 
from the couple. 

“I’ll help you put it on the

T he old man who watched the 
deer. He had dreamed his 
second wife in his dreams. He had 
dreamed that. But she had been 
real. She had come when emptiness 
and bitterness had possessed him. 
When the feathers of his youth had 
been torn from his wings. She filled 
him again with bright pieces of 
dreams. And for him, in that 
second half of his life, far from his 
son and that first one, he began 
again. Flying. Noticing the world. 
His eyes saw the green things, his 
lips tasted the sweet things and his 
old age was warm. 

It was all bright and fast and 
moving, that second life of his and

RICHARD C. HOAGLAND 

FOLLOWING YONDER STAR 


D awn. Far below, curving away 
north and south, the termi- 
nator cumulonimbus glowed bril- 
liant red against the night. A 
scattered wall of cloud arched in 
weather fronts arrayed to meet 'the 
rising of a new day’s star, crimson- 
tipped sentinels standing watch 
along the racing line separating 
night from light — the color creep- 
ing down the piled up flanks, 
yellowing, whitening, until at last a 
dazzling squadron of brilliantly 
armored men-at-arms paid homage 
to a scene repeated endlessly for 
well over three billion years. An- 
other day had overtaken Earth j . 

Murdoch watched a scene he’d 
viewed a thousand times, yet never 
tired of. However repetitious the 
process was, the detail of each new 
terrestrial sunrise seen from above 
was endlessly entrancing. The slow, 
glow-like illumination of a towering 
thunderhead as the dawnline swept 
across it from the west, the blue 
electric lightning of self-illumina- 
tion giving way to the incomparably 
brighter light of a star over ninety 
million miles away. And the sweep 
of prismatic color along flat shards 
of ice spread before a low, or the 


screen-like vertical projection of the 
entire rainbow upon a particularly 
tall convective form — that was 
beauty. An ever-changing canvas 
and a brush of light — pure color 
sprayed upon a world by the ther- 
monuclear fire of a sun, shaped by 
the refractive properties of a 
planetary atmosphere, and appre- 
ciated by a lone observer on his way 
to work. 

Murdoch was an astronomer 
who, at the moment, was about to 
start his day just as everybody back 
on the Mountain, he thought wryly, 
was about to turn in. Oh, well, he 
grinned silently, at least I’m 
looking down at those clouds. 

Clouds were the last concern of 
an astronomer out here. As Mur- 
doch’s Shuttle rose in its transfer 
ellipse to meet the LST orbiting al- 
most 1000 kilometers above the 
clouds of Earth, his thoughts 
ranged across the span of 
astronomy, from its origins beneath 
the clouds, to its limitless future in 
its element, at last — the starry, 
atmosphereless vacuum of the Uni- 
verse. 

We’ve come a long way, he 
thought, and haven’t even begun. 


129 


The LST was the first decent as- 
tronomical instrument to be placed 
in orbit. Descendant of the pio- 
neering OAO’s, this monster was a 
full-sized observatory-class tele- 
scope — 120 inches of beautiful 
glass — in an incomparable setting. 

1 wonder if Evans got his spectra 
of3C - 95, Murdock mused idly. A 
front had been threatening and 
even high thin ice could ruin an ex- 
posure of several hours duration, of 
an object that dim. That’s why this 
baby (he leaned forward in the 
couch against the restraining straps 
to peer out the double-paned 
window) is so valuable. For every 
hour we use to advantage up here, 
he thought, we waste three down 
there due to weather, the moon, or 
just plain bad seeing. 

If he shielded his eyes from the 
reflected and scattered glare of the 
sun, he thought he could make out 
a few of the brighter stars. Damn 
the fact that scattered light was 
such a problem in space. That was 
one advantage an astronomer had 
back on Earth — 8,000 miles of 
planet between him and the sun, 
and an enormous shadow to hide in 
and look out from. Out here, he 
thought, you have to baffle and 
screen, and never point the damn’ 
thing even near the sun, or differ- 
ential heating would warp it per- 
manently out of line. It was a plain 
nuisance, having to plan each ob- 
servation through a computer, just 
so some attitude jockey didn’t 
someday forget and point the entire 


LST at the sun! Yet, it had its 
compensations. No seeing prob- 
lems. The stars just sat there. 
Didn’t twinkle at all. Might as well 
have been holes in an enormous 
black blanket, like one of those 
early planetaria. 

At that moment the Captain of 
the Shuttle toned Murdoch on the 
Comm line. 

“Hey, Doc?’’ 

“Yeah, Ben!” 

“We’ve gofer in sight. Houston 
sent the button-up signal about five 
minutes ago and we caught the 
flash as she turned.” 

NASA was being very cautious. 
The LST, not counting the value of 
its incomparable research, was 
worth about a quarter of a billion 
dollars. As it was about to rendez- 
vous with a space shuttle emitting, 
among other things, interesting 
quantities of oxygen, water vapor, 
hydrazine, nitrogen, stray hydro- 
carbons and, yes, even a trace of 
ozone, NASA sent commands to 
seal every optical port — tight! — and 
orient it so the shuttle approached 
from below and behind the big tele- 
scope. Murdoch still mentally saw 
the image of the solar shield of the 
repaired skylab space-station back 
in ’74, dancing in the “wind” of the 
reaction control thrusters of the 
Apollo shuttle vehicle. The damage 
such materials could wreak imping- 
ing upon the 15-foot wide primary 
mirror of this space-jewel made 
him shudder. No, during the length 
of their visit to this distant “eye,” 


130 


IF 



its lids would be closed, its vital 
parts protected against the contam- 
ination its earthly creators inevi- 
tably brought with them, even here. 
That is why, thought Murdoch 
sadly, men may never look through 
a space telescope directly. Even the 
miniscule escaping atmosphere of 
the best suits would do permanent 
damage to the exquisite geometry 
of glass and aluminum. We’ll just 
have to be content, he thought, 
with the photographs and tele- 
vision. 

And with that last almost regret- 
ful assessment of the art of space 
astronomy, Dr. Robert Murdoch 
(Ph.D.) prepared to put on his hel- 
met and span the short distance 
separating the immobile telescope 
from the station-keeping shuttle. 
His job: to retrieve film cannisters 
loaded from two weeks constant ob- 
servation, insert new film, and re- 
place a faulty image tube with 
another. 

A thousand kilometers below, 
sunset was claiming another line of 
ruby sentinels before the splendor 
of night. 

****** 

T his scene, or something like it, 
will come to pass sometime in 
the early 1980’s. At that time, 
NASA plans to place in a medium 
earth orbit the largest optical tele- 
scope ever to leave Earth. It will 
rank, along with its earthly 
counterparts, as the world’s fourth 


largest, after the 236” in the 
Russian Crimea, the 200” on Palo- 
mar, and the 150” at Kitt Peak. 

It will beat all of them, hands 
down. 

The Large Space Telescope, as it 
will be called, will extend Man’s 
vision to the edge of the Universe. 
It will collect more light, resolve far 
greater detail, and work far more 
efficiently than even its larger ter- 
restrial counterparts. It will have, 
available to it the full range of 
radiation from the stars, unfiltered 
by the atmosphere so essential to its 
creators. It will function at the 
theoretical limit of resolving power 
for a parabolic mirror 120 inches in 
diameter, capable of detecting 
man-made artifacts as small as 
ocean liners from the moon’s dis- 
tance! Which means . nothing. 

Astronomy as a science has a 
history of making the best of an es- 
sentially bad situation. To start 
with, the things you’d like to see are 
out of reach. This means you’ll 
never (except in the case of planets) 
be able to go there and pick up a 
piece to verify what you think 
you’ve found out by looking from 
afar. Of course, someday, when 
starships are a reality . But who 
wants to wait? 

To circumvent this fundamental 
problem, astronomers have devised 
all sorts of neat and ingenious tech- 
niques for detecting, deciphering, 
and decoding the messengers of 
events so far away — light. 

The first astronomers used their 


FOLLOWING YONDER STAR 


131 



eyes (what else?). The human eye is 
not too bad as a collection device. It 
has a surprising range of re- 
sponse — about a billion to one. The 
same eye that can see comfortably 
on a blazing beach in the Carib- 
bean can also detect, after suitable 
dark adaptation, stars as faint as 
the fifth magnitude. A fifth magni- 
tude star is generally the faintest a 
human with normal sight can see 
by looking up into the night sky — 
although in clear desert air, you 
can do somewhat better. 

The naked eye, however, really 
falls down when it comes to resolv- 
ing fine detail. It can just resolve 
two objects of equal brightness if 
they’re separated by about 60 arc 
seconds. Thus, to the eye, the 
planets remain star-like images 
even though many (Jupiter, Saturn, 
Venus, even Mars) sometimes ap- 
proach apparent diameters as great 
as 60 arc seconds at their closest 
approach to Earth. Craters on the 
moon had to await detection by 
Galileo; for human eyesight, while 
capable of seeing such bright spots 
as Copernicus or Tycho, could not 
sufficiently resolve them to perceive 
their true nature. So, too, with 
positional astronomy. 

The history of astronomy, par- 
ticularly the idea that we are on a 
planet orbiting the sun instead of 
sitting still while everything moves 
around us, may have been quite 
different if the human eye could re- 
solve smaller detail. It was the 
limits of detectable errors in plane- 


tary positions occasioned by the 
limits of the human eye that put 
off, for centuries, a correct inter- 
pretation of the planetary spectacle. 

Thus, to state that the LST will 
be able to detect objects as small as 
ocean liners or things 200 feet 
across at the distance of the moon, 
does not quite convey the power 
this resolution finally gives to Man. * 
It’s in the same league as telling 
you how far away the LST could see 
a dime and tell it was a dime. Tele- 
scopes are rarely used to detect 
dimes in space or look for ocean 
liners on the Mare of Selene! 

What they are used for and what 
will be the prime target of the LST 
is the probing of the limits of the 
Universe, billions of light years 
away. The LST will produce 
images, record spectra, and make 
measurements of objects that today 
are perceived by terrestrial tele- 
scopes and even the new space- 
borne OAO’s wrongly, through 
limitations of instrument and tech- 
nique. What could come from this, 
new capability to see the Universe 
undistorted could be as fundamen- 
tal as the new cosmology finally 
made necessary by Copernicus to 
explain errors that became larger 
than the limits of the human eye. 

Under the exquisite observing 
conditions of space, the LST will 
study Quasars unhampered by the 
shimmering and filtering effect of 
Earth’s atmosphere. Long exposure 
imagery — tens and even hundreds 
of hours — will show detail hope-

IF 



lessly swamped by the variety of 
lights in Earth’s night sky- — artifi- 
cial, airglow from the air itself, 
scattered moonlight, etc. The fine- 
ness of that detail, unsmeared by 
shifting blobs of air that act like 
lenses in the atmosphere, moving 
images around at the image plane 
of the telescope, will allow detailed 
study of the structure of Quasars, 
location of suspected quasar-like 
objects within the nuclei of galaxies 
billions of light years distant, and 
emagery of quasars in wave lengths 
too long or short to penetrate to the 
ground-based sentinels of Man. 

If Quasars actually represent ob- 
jects at the dawn of creation, the 
LST will probably tell us so. 

Other objects that will hopefully 
yield up their secrets under the un- 
precedented scrutiny of a major 
telescope in space read like a 
“Who’s Who’’ of the new 
astronomy: pulsars, neutron stars, 
supernovae remnants, infrared 
sources, X-ray sources, and black 
holes. The quantum leap repre- 
sented by the use of a telescope 
capable of seeing objects 1000 
times smaller and 1 million times 
dimmer than the human eye has 
ever seen, from space, is at present 
just perceivable. If we can study 
actual images of pulsars illumi- 
nating their surrounding gaseous 
nebulae (such as the famous Crab, 
a remnant of a supernova in 1054 
a.d.) or look for the ultraviolet 
images of the now invisible com- 
ponent of Cygnus X-l (suspected to 


be the first black hole “detected”), 
or study the structure of a red-giant 
star in widely separated wave 
lengths (which will actually allow us 
to see, for the first time, the disc of 
a giant sun), then we shall be able 
to put to rest a whole series of now 
raging questions as to the funda- 
mental nature of these objects. We 
shall also raise at least ten new 
questions for each answer we 
obtain. 

M urdoch floated easily beside 
the giant. In his hands, se- 
cured by a light nylon safety line 
were the loaded film cassettes from 
the big telescope. (He grimaced, re- 
membering how they kept losing 
those gloves and Hasselblads out of 
Gemini.) Inside, ready to be put to 
work, fresh film magazines. And 
the image-tube replacement was 
also on the job, the old one return- 
ing with Murdoch for routine 
analysis. 

The LST was coming up on local 
noon, the sun to the south of the 
orbit. Below, the coast of Western 
Europe lay in summer. Murdoch 
looked for, and imagined he saw, 
the teeming beaches of the Riviera. 
He could see, farther North, the 
Channel. How different, he 
wondered, would history have been 
if that Island had been a part of the 
Continent. Or, if the ocean level 
had been lower during recorded 
history. From up here, he thought,

the British Isles did look like pieces 
of the main continent, somehow 
broken off and drifting out to sea. 
Damn funny place to build the 
world’s first observatory! 

He strained to glimpse the 
ancient circle of stones standing 
alone in the middle of the Salisbury 
Plain. One observer floating be- 
neath an intricate observatory, 
peering across 1,000 kilometers 
and 5,000 years at another .

O ur ancestors, much more 
han we, must have been in- 
tensely aware of the cyclic forces in 
their lives, the days and seasons of 
the earth. They had to be. Too 
much — everything — depended on 
knowing and following such cycles. 

Thus it is not surprising that 
Alexander Marshack, a science- 
writer turned anthropologist, 
should have discovered evidence 
that ancient people lived time- 
factored lives. What is surprising is 
his apparent discovery of the 
antiquity of such knowledge and its 
astronomical basis. 

Marshack, beginning with a 
small bone artifact of an obscure 
culture in North Africa, was led to 
the brilliant inspiration that some 
heretofore “decorative” markings 
on the 8,000 year old object were in 
fact related to some periodic phe- 
nomena in the environment. It was 
the nature of the marks that led 
him toward his fascinating dis- 


covery. They seemed to appear in 
groupings of five, followed by a se- 
quence of eight, several outstand- 
ing marks, then an inverse repeti- 
tion. 

After trying to match various 
cycles: years of good or bad rain- 
fall, seasons of good hunting, etc., 
Marshack was slowly but inexor- 
ably led toward one unique cycle 
which fit the markings: the orbit of 
the moon. Someone, millennia be- 
fore the supposed invention of 
writing, was keeping careful note of 
the phases of Selene from first cres- 
cent to first quarter, then to full, 
which appear as three approxi- 
mately equal marks (because it is 
quite difficult to tell exactly which 
night the moon is full; try it, some- 
time, without prior knowledge), 
followed by the shrinking of the 
moon back to a crescent. Even the 
days of invisibility, due to the moon 
being too close to the sun to be 
seen, were indicated! And the aver- 
aging of several cycles on the arti- 
fact revealed missing marks due, 
probably, to cloudy nights. 

Staggered by the implication of 
his simple bone relic, Marshack be- 
gan to look at other cultures which 
had briefly trod this planet, to be 
swallowed up by time. He roamed 
the museums of Europe, searching 
out forgotten implements and arti- 
facts catalogued and put away as 
“ceremonial” or “decorative.” And 
he found the moon stretching back 
through the millennia and minds of 
forever-lost craftsmen — on reindeer 


134 


IF 



antlers, and eagles’ claw, 'on 
mammoth-ivory, and painted bril- 
liantly on the walls of caves. 

In an unbroken line he discover- 
ed an awareness of the lunar cycle 
stretching back through the 
Mesolithic Azilian, the Magda- 
lenian, and the Aurignacian 
cultures, like Time’s arrow. Each 
artifact moved Man’s “developed” 
consciousness of the astronomical 
further back along the path of 
evolution, until Marshack seemed 
to find the Beginnings in the Upper 
Paleolithic, almost 40,000 years 
before recorded history — 400 cen- 
turies of watching, noting, and 
following faithfully the strange 
cycle of one of the two great lights 
of heaven — amid the ice-age snows 
of Europe. 

With this one discovery, the 
origins of art, symbolism, religion, 
political power, and even agricul- 
ture (of which we shall say more 
presently) seemed traceable to an 
awareness of the astronomical, the 
constant interplay of the forces 
which move the earth around the 
sun and the moon around the 
earth, that shape the length of the 
day and the duration of the sea- 
sons. Suddenly, Man, across tens 
of thousands of years of pre-his- 
tory, was not merely an ignorant 
savage cowering in caves in the 
dark, but the possessor of an intel- 
lect and a curiosity that could 
watch patiently the movement of 
the shadowed face of Selene 
through the night sky and leave a 


record of his first tentative attempt 
to understand. 

Each year, each generation, 
across the thousands of lifetimes 
from the Paleolithic through the 
Neolithic toward the present, saw 
minute improvements of that 
record. The observations grew 
more sophisticated and the tools 
more grandiose. A new architec- 
tural invention made its appear- 
ance, quite unlike its far-off 
descendants, yet tied together with 
the same dependence on the sky — 
the astronomical observatory. 

First, just a crude circle of earth 
to form an artificial horizon in 
which a few logs were erected to 
mark the rising and setting of the 
sun at different seasons, yet these 
beginnings of organized observa- 
tion of the astronomical would pro- 
foundly affect all future genera- 
tions. 

It is from these rude beginnings 
that the marvel of the Neolithic, the 
embodiment of all previous thou- 
sands of watchers of the day and 
night, was born. Stonehenge. On 
the flat chalk plain this monument 
to Man’s quest of Understanding 
arose, bit by bit, across a thousand 
years while the pyramids were still 
unassembled clay amid the drifting 
sands bordering the Nile, the erec- 
tion of this sophisticated observa- 
tory/computer continued on Salis- 
bury Plain. Around the brooding 
stones seeming to hang from the 
very sky itself, trade, the evolution 
of great cultures, the shift of history 


FOLLOWING YONDER STAR 


135 



to another age (the bronze age), 
and the intermingling of the people 
of a continent, took place. 

It was the highest product of the 
minds and culture which had 
fostered its construction over a 
millennium, erected on the bits of 
bone and eagle claw, the recording 
of thousands of earlier observers. 
In the inexorable fulfillment of 
geometry, as Earth spun about her 
axis and moved around the sun, as 
her companion in the night, Selene, 
drifted overhead, even across the 
sun and into the yawning shadow of 
the earth, Stonehenge watched and 
noted, its granite markers as 
eternal as the sky. Amidst pagean- 
try and ceremony its builders as- 
sembled the people to demonstrate 
their mastery of the gods them- 
selves; for, used as a computer, the 
circle of stones standing on the 
plain beneath the bowl of heaven 
could even tell when the daystar 
would be blotted out, for all to see. 

Stonehenge was the culmination 
of a process 35,000 years in the 
making. In its brooding markers 
and geometry was contained the 
sum of Paleolithic and Neolithic 
understanding of the sky and earth. 
It was a tool and symbol — as useful 
and significant to its epoch as 
Apollo is to ours. 

To achieve its creation and to use 
it well, Man had to learn of his de- 
pendence on the sky. The vast se- 
quence of agriculture, orderly 
planting, harvesting, and process- 
ing of food to support the rise of 


cities and the growth of diversified 
activities, was made possible only 
with this knowledge of astronomy. 
In a thousand interwoven threads 
the tapestry of cultural enrichment 
is traceable to the independence 
which systematic food production 
gave to chieftains, kings, and em- 
perors. It was the “fallout” of this 
wealth which made possible the 
maintenance of artists, writers, and 
musicians and the creation of the 
architectural marvels of our world.

M urdoch finished the last 
series of photographs as he 
and the LST sailed across the ter- 
minator for the second time. 
Checking the magazine ident, he 
touched the control of his backpack 
thruster unit, moving slowly up the 
length of the sealed tube. The new 
anti-UV paint was doing the job, he 
noted. His photographs would con- 
firm the lack of bubbles on the sur- 
face of the instrument. 

“I’m just about finished here,” 
he commed the shuttle now hang- 
ing patiently above the telescope — 
with reference to the dwindling 
crescent earth. “I’ll take the sunset 
series. Then give me the lights and 
I’ll come in.” 

“Anything you say, Doc. It’s 
your mission. We only serve who 
hang and wait ...” The laconic 
voice of Lt. Ben Crowder, horrible 
punster, sounded quite loud this

close to the Shuttle. Murdoch re- 
duced the volume. 

The sun touched the limb. 
Slowly, but faster than he’d ex- 
pected, the LST began to turn. Its 
elongated shape, a stark white 
cylinder against the deep of space, 
was rapidly transformed into a 
russet cigar, followed by the star- 
tling shift to kelly green. They flew 
on, he taking pictures with the 
Hasselblad, the advanced telescope 
slicing through the dispersed rays 
of the occulted sun. It was now a 
glowing blue electric wand — now 
shifting back to green, yellow, 
orange-yellow . .! 

Rapidly advancing the color film 
with always clumsy gloved hands, 
Murdoch watched as, along the 
earth’s panoramic limb beneath the 
living telescope, another light was 
spreading. The moon was rising, 
full, its familiar countenance in- 
credibly distorted by identical color 
shifts as it rose through the atmos- 
pheric layers. 

Click . Wh-r-r-r . Click , . 
He imagined he could hear, as well 
as feel through the insulating 
gloves, the vibration of the advanc- 
ing mechanism. The moon was now 
a yellow lantern, familiar seas smil- 
ing across a quarter-million miles. 
Above it, catching the last disper- 
sive rays of a rapidly disappearing 
star, the LST was a brilliant, ruby- 
colored rod. They hung there for an 
instant in the round glass, the tele- 
scope above, pointing toward In- 
finity, the moon below, and the 


softly lit limb of Earth beneath 
them both. He snapped the pic- 
ture — a perfect exclamation point 
of moon and telescope. Smiling, he 
secured the camera and began the 
short trip home.

I t is five years tonight (as I write 
this) since men first left foot- 
prints on the moon. It is the same 
moon other men watched, wor- 
shipped, and notated amid our 
ice-age origins, thus making 
possible those footprints. 

“Like a circle in a spiral, like a 
wheel within a wheel ...” 

The study of the moon makes 
possible greater study of the moon, 
makes possible visits to the moon, 
makes possible study of the Uni- 
verse Beyond . 

The LST, like astronomy itself, is 
making the best of an essentially 
bad situation. To begin with, the 
telescope will be fabricated on 
Earth. The mirror will be poured 
and figured under “normal’’ 
gravity and the design and 
construction of the entire optical 
device guided by the fact that it 
must be launched brutally into 
orbit by a large Saturn-class launch 
vehicle, subjected to accelerations, 
distortions, and vibrations down- 
right sacrilegious to an instrument 
of which is expected such exquisite 
precision. 

Even after achieving orbit, the 
LST will be subjected to environ- 


FOLLOWING YONDER STAR 


137 



mental indignities by virtue of its 
position in an orbit of the earth. 
The constant day and night, half of 
each 90-minute-plus orbit, will pro- 
duce thermal strains on precise 
pointing optics, alignment mirrors, 
and focus planes. Gravity, the 
omnipresent pull of greater “G’s” 
at the base of the telescope than at 
the top, because of the mere fact 
that the top is farther from the 
center of the earth (in certain atti- 
tudes) will place elaborate con- 
straints on long exposures, pointing 
accuracy, motor life of reaction 
wheels and electronic circuitry 
necessary to monitor these environ- 
mental anomalies. Add to this, 
radiation pressure, the baffling re- 
quirement to prevent scattered 
light, the constant interruption of a 
particular observation as the target 
goes behind the earth for 45 
minutes out of every orbit, and the 
necessity of constant resupply of 
attitude control gas (used to dump 
excess momentum caused by sta- 
bilizing an object in a weightless 
environment of many energy 
sources and no readily available 
sinks ) and you begin to perceive a 
few of the prices which must be 
paid for establishing a telescope in 
the “weightless environment of 
Earth orbit.” 

It is not surprising, therefore, 
that the descendants of the LST 
will surely be built upon the moon. 
It is there, securely rooted in the 
lunar crust, that telescopes six 
times larger than the largest terres- 


trial counterpart are possible. The 
light, one-sixth gravity of Luna will 
simplify everything from structures 
to the mirror optics themselves. It 
seems reasonable to envision opti- 
cal instruments of a thousand 
inches, built upon Selene. 

Instead of only forty-five minutes 
of darkness possible in earth orbit 
(actually still orbiting within 
Earth’s outer atmosphere of hydro- 
gen), a telescope upon the moon 
will have two weeks — fourteen 
days — of absolute darkness, the 
darkest night possible this close to 
the sun if the facility is placed on 
the Farside of the moon. This 
means two weeks uninterrupted 
imagery or other observations with 
a light-bucket capable of collecting 
100 times the light of the LST, in a 
vacuum just as good (if not better 
for some observations — above the 
last of the terrestrial hydrogen 
halo) than that found in Earth 
orbit. 

The two weeks of night (and, of 
course, day) will also allow better 
design for thermal expansion and 
contraction. Components of differ- 
ing expansion coefficients — glass 
and plastic seals, for instance — will 
have a chance to stabilize for 
several hours before serious obser- 
vations. And, depending on the 
exact location, it might even be 
possible to surround the telescope 
with a multiple layered reflector de- 
signed to keep the instrument in 
permanent shadow — an island of 
eternal night and perfect darkness

beneath even the blazing heat of 
lunar noon. 

From its vantage point on the 
airless face of Man’s familiar satel- 
lite, with its awesome thousand- 
inch diameter, what could such an 
astronomer’s dream-come-reality 
perceive across the dark light 
years? What could we see? 

We have touched briefly upon 
the cosmological questions the LST 
will seek to answer. These questions 
will also fall within the purvue of 
the Lunar Telescope. Therefore 
let’s use the remainder of this paper 
to examine the one new subject 
soon to be brought within the realm 
of stellar astronomy by the con- 
struction of these future observa- 
tories — just as its solar system 
counterpart is about to be brought 
within our grasp by Viking — the 
search for life in the Universe. 

Astronomy began with the moon, 
a quest to understand an apparent- 
ly living entity — a god — and its 
regulation of all living things on 
earth. How appropriate, therefore, 
that it is from an observatory on 
that same moon that Man will 
probably first collect irrefutable 
astronomical evidence of the exis- 
tence of interstellar life. 

To exist, life as we know it must 
have planets orbiting a stable star 
for billions of years to allow time 
for evolution; and if they are to be 
detected, they must be relatively 
close at hand (astronomically 
speaking) for us to see them at all. 

Planets, even such giants as Jupi- 


ter (ten times the size of Earth), 
shining only by the reflected light of 
their primary, are very dim com- 
pared to stars. Thus, only the 
planets of the nearest stars, those 
within twenty light years of Earth, 
would be within range of even the 
super Lunar telescope envisioned 
here. The problem: to detect the 
faint glimmerings of tiny planets 
moving around points of light 500 
million times as bright! 

At first it seems impossible. Even 
at the distance of the nearest star, 
4.3 light years away, a planet as 
large as Jupiter [a Jupiter is, of 
course, not an earth. It is useful, 
however, if detected, as it is 
thought that a Jovian-type planet 
should be accompanied in any solar 
system by smaller, more terrestrial 
types. So we start by trying to 
detect a Jupiter . .] will only be a 
point of light, never a disc, of ap- 
proximately plus 25 magnitude. 
Without getting lost in technicali- 
ties, that is the dimmest object the 
world’s largest telescope can detect 
today. And that’s only if it knows 
exactly where to look. It doesn’t 
apply to a photograph where you’re 
looking for a tiny point of light that 
moved since the photograph you 
took last week was taken. Such a 
planet search, for a dim, moving 
point of light is only practical with 
a telescope large enough so that a 
plus-25 magnitude star is ten or 
maybe twenty times its threshold 
limit. The Lunar 1200-inch should 
have a limit 100 times greater than 


FOLLOWING YONDER STAR 


139 



the 200-inch on Palomar on the 
LST (since, other things being 
equal, they will have roughly com- 
parable light gathering ability). 
The LST will still win in the resolu- 
tion category by virtue of being in 
orbit. And the Lunar Telescope will 
have ten times the LST’s resolu- 
tion . 

Thus, beginning with the LST, 
Man will move into an era when it 
becomes possible to see the planets 
of his nearest stellar neighbors — if 
they are there. A Jupiter, even an 
Earth, orbiting the nearest suns 
should be detectable by the LST, 
certainly by the Lunar Telescope. 
The problem of finding them — tiny 
points of light moving around an- 
other point millions of times as 
bright — is also relatively simple. 
An artificial eclipse. 

By hiding the parent star behind 
an occulting disc (or arranging it so 
the light of the star falls through a 
hole cut into the photographic plate 
or TV tube in a vacuum [author’s 
invention, rch], it should be pos- 
sible with both the LST and the 
Lunar Telescope to photograph 
planets orbiting stars other than 
the sun. 

But . how do we detect life 
light years away? 

For that task, after the first flush 
of success in finding visual proof 
(as opposed to the gravitational sig- 
natures certain astronomers cur- 
rently attribute to unseen planets 
orbiting certain stars) even the LST 
will probably prove too small. 


It will fall to the Lunar Telescope 
to produce spectra of new planets. 
Such spectra, analyzed for oxygen, 
methane, and perhaps even un- 
natural hydrocarbons would, if 
positive, give us strong circum- 
stantial evidence of a world like 
Earth with oxygen produced by 
biological activity, as well as 
methane. Sufficient ingenuity of 
such research might even be able to 
detect the presence of a techno- 
logical civilization upon such a 
planet if it were confronted with the 
environmental problems currently 
confronting our own. To identify 
more advanced civilizations (those 
in which technology has gone be- 
yond disturbing the natural en- 
virons) would require other tech- 
niques. 

Information on an entirely new 
aspect of stellar astronomy: the de- 
tection, cataloguing, and descrip- 
tion of the planets of other solar 
systems is perfectly possible — given 
sufficient technological advance in 
the construction of space tele- 
scopes. Even the detection of at- 
mospheric components unequivo- 
cally produced by biological activity 
is possible from an observatory on 
the Moon! It is even within the 
realm of possibility to infer the pre- 
sence of an environment-modifying 
technology and, thus, an intelligent 
species. 

B ut, as with all history — as with 
his patient nights of marking 
the changing shape of the lunar

IF 



disc, Man, once he has tasted the 
success of finding other worlds 
amid the stars, will not rest until 
they exist as more than distant 
points of light. Even as his vessels 
prepare for the distant voyage, so 
his curiosity will impel him to 
create optical descendants of even 
the Lunar behemoth. 

Thus in the feeble sunlight, il- 
luminating but not heating that 
which exists “out there’’ four 
billion miles from Earth, Man will 
construct, at the edge of the Abyss, 
the Ultimate telescope. A huge re- 
flector scores of miles across, a 
mirror capable of lighting fires at 
its focus with the collected light of 


stars! Such a creation, capable of 
imaging their planets, or peering 
beyond the dawn of time itself, will 
share few things in common with its 
ancient granite ancestor so distant 
both in space and in time, upon the 
Salisbury Plain. 

And yet, as Stonehenge once 
tried to understand the moon’s in- 
fluence over men, and Man has at 
last become an influence on the 
moon — so, perhaps, this vast 
crystalline creation, floating on the 
edge of space separating solar 
system from the interstellar night, 
shall one day see an age when Man, 
through understanding extends his 
Dominion to the Stars. •

Yes, three big Yale padlocks are 
necessary . and the heavy 
chains . and the thick steel 
bolts. One time in 1956 he got out 
and — help me lift this oak bar, 
will you? 

Now, for God’s sake, remember 
to keep your distance. If he ever 
gets his claws on you . and sinks 
in his fangs . Well, let’s just say 
I bury a lot of bones. 

I’ve got to oil those hinges one of 
these years. Hold the lantern a bit 
higher . 

There he is! The sight makes you 
suck breath in horror, doesn’t it? I 
warned you. It’s those green and 
red eyes that get most people . 


and the evil laugh. Don’t try to 
speak to him. I do all the talking. 

“Alter? You feel like talking 
science fiction today?’’ 

“Why don’t you ever bring any 
women down here, Geis?” 

“I know you too welf. No girls. 
Not now, not ever! Now, this 
adventurous gentleman wants to 
know why you hate intellectual 
science fiction.” 

“I don’t hate it, Geis, I loathe it. 
There is a fine distinction there. 
Thus I hate the so-called food you 
send down here, I loathe intellec- 
tual s-f, and I abominate you and 
your shameless commercialization 
of me. But I can do very little about 
any of these conditions, so I accept 
them . until I — ” 

“You’ll never get loose again! I 
wear the Amulet. I wear the Ring. I 
speak the Sacret Words: Yug 

Sluggoth Thunkis Fgn-thi-Ul- 
gudd ...” 

“Just because Fritz Leiber 
muttered those words at you that 
time when you visited him too early 
in the morning — ” 

“They keep you under control, 


142 





Alter. Fritz is wise. Now, in the Un- 
speakable name of Yug Sluggoth, I 
command you to respond to the 
question.” 

‘‘What was the damn question? I 
get distracted. Listen, Geis, only 
five minutes once a year with a 
sweet, young thing with big ones, a 
narrow waist, limpid blue eyes, a 
soft smile . .” 

“Intellectual science fiction, 
Alter! Why do you hate it?” 

“How about once every two 
years? Damn it, Geis, I’m horny, 
I’ve—” 

“Yug Slug-’ 

“all right! Stop the damn 
chant. If you knew what that com- 
bination of sounds does to my 
sinuses — ” 

“We’ve got to get down to busi- 
ness. I don’t have all day to humor 
you. For the last time: address 
yourself to why you loathe intellec- 
tual science fiction.” 

“I loathe it because . be- 
cause . You want the real truth? 
I loathe it because it’s mostly over 
my head. Yes, damn it, I don’t 
understand the subtle symbolisms, 
the obscure references, the ab- 
strusenesses, the ambiguities, the 
God-damned zilch endings that 
leave me baffled and angry and 
saying ‘Wha — ?’ to myself.” 

“That’s because you’re stupid, 
Alter. You are ignorant, essentially 
uneducated, and have an I.Q. of 
only 137.” 

“Yeah, that’s my point. I’ve had 
two years of college. After all my 


psychometric tests in high school I 
was told I had a big vocabulary, a 
fine sense for spacial relationships, 
and an I.Q. sufficient to allow me 
to teach at the high school level if I 
attended teach-college.” 

“Instead, you lured me into be- 
coming a kind of beatnik in Cali- 
fornia, and lured me into writing 
sex novels for a living. Eighty-four 
sex novels! My God, if that got 
out — ” 

“You want me to continue to 
work myself into a Diatribe, Geis, 
or do you want to piss and moan 
about our scandalous youth?” 
“Finish, finish. Try to say it a 
little differently this time, though, 
will you? I’ve heard it so many 
times before ...” 

“Go eat sour grapes! Now, if a 
lot of this intellectual, arty, affect- 
ed science fiction is too obscure and 
‘private’ for me to understand, how 
in hell is the average s-f reader go- 
ing to cope with it . and why 
should he have to cope with it?” 

“‘ Affected ’? Now that’s a pretty 
strong — ” 

“This stuff is a rip-off, Geis. It is 
the product, largely, of egotism and 
pride; an incestuous little band of 
arrogant phoneys — ” 

“‘ Phoneys ’ ? Now that’s a pretty 
strong — ” 

“ — who get their jollies by pre- 
tending to be ‘superior’ to 99% of 
the readers of the magazines and 
books in which their junk 
appears.” 

“‘ Junk ’? Alter—” 


143 



“Don’t stop me now, Geis, I’m 
rolling! See, these jokers maybe are 
smarter than most readers, and 
their psychology is that they are 
superior and the only way they can 
prove it is to write stuff we can’t 
understand very well unless they or 
a pipe-smoking English professor 
explains it. They hate us, Geis. 
They secretly hate us readers. They 
do! We are the ones who indirectly 
pay them. Ultimately, we have the 
power to kill them dead, money- 
wise . and probably ego-wise, 
too. They hate and fear us! That’s 
why they always snear at us and re- 
vile us as low-lifes and tasteless 
clods.” 

“You go too far, Alter!” 

“Help that guy stand up, Geis. 
So they write their arty-farty ‘ex- 
perimental’ crap that’s been 
written by intellectual writers since 
Ug first put a stick to a cave wall 
and they try to make us feel dumb 
because we don’t understand it and 
don’t like it. We sense their true 
motives, you see, and we know 
these stories and novels are de- 
liberately written unclear and 
ambiguous.” 

“There are ideas and themes and 
subtleties which cannot be cast into 
black and white narrative forms, 
Alter!” 

“Bullshit, Geis! Intellectual s-f is 
a style of writing, it’s a type of 
narrative, it’s a tool and it’s a role 
for the writer to play. Writing 
Literature and playing at being an 
Intellectual is much more satisfying 


to the ego than Hack Writer is. 
And after having been to college 
and having been exposed to all 
them Eng. Lit courses and such, no 
self-respecting young writer nowa- 
days is going to dig being a Hack 
Writer and writing Commercial 
Fiction.” 

“Alter, I can refute thee.” 

“Only because you can shut me 
up. Would you care to listen to 
what Gore Vidal wrote in the July 
18 issue of THE NEW YORK REVIEW 
of Books? I quote: ‘The American 
university has come into its terrible 
own. Departments of English now 
produce by what appears to be 
parthogenesis novels intended only 
for the classroom; my favorite dem- 
onstrated that the universe is — 
what else? — the university. Oc- 
casionally a university novel (or 
U-novel) will be read by the general 
(and dwindling) public for the 
novel; and sometimes a novel 
written for that same public 
(P-novel) will be absorbed into 
Academe, but more and more the 
division between the two realms 
grows and soon what is written to 
be taught in class will stay there 
and what is written to be read out- 
side will stay there, too. On that 
day the kingdom of prose will end, 
with an exegesis.’ 

“How did you get hold of that?” 

“You threw it down the garbage 
chute with my food yesterday. The 
only magazines you save are play- 
boy, PENTHOUSE . 

“So what is your point with that 


144 


IF 



Vidal quote?” 

‘‘The point is obvious, dumb 
one. More and more s-f writers are 
writing for the university crowd, 
and more and more editors are 
editing for the university crowd. 
We are a trendy, faddish, con- 
formist nation, and s-f writers are 
not immune, in spite of their vaunt- 
ed non-conformist pretensions.” 

“You know, Alter, if you could 
prove one single — ” 

“A symptom, a proof, if you will, 
Geis, is that six or seven years ago 
most of the thirtyish and fortyish 
writers were short-haired straight 
types. NOW ... I really have to 
snigger . they’re most of them 
long haired and dressed to the 
youth culture trend. What Asimov 
has lost on top he lets grow down 
the back of his neck, and sports 
fluffy mutton-chop sideburns, to 
boot. Harlan Ellison has adopted 
the slab look — waterfalls of straight 
hair over ears and forehead. Larry 
Niven has a full beard and hair all 
over the place. Bob Silverberg looks 
like a guru. Barry Malzberg looks 
like an older Norman Spinrad who 
in turn looks like a petulant fallen 
angel. Even Jerry Pournelle who 
two years ago was Mr. Straight, has 
capitulated and conformed to 
fashion with a long side-burned, 
shaggy mane with mustache look.” 

“That’s a low-blow personal 
attack — ” 

****************************** 
It certainly is. Alter. Besides, may- 


be it's just that now, at last, they 
feel free to be and express their 
wonderful true selves! Er . 
hello. Dr. A. Gee, I didn't know 
you were reading this! Heh, Heh. 
Oh! Hi, Larry! Jerry — what are you 
doing here!?! Hey, Guys — honest — 
I didn 't write it; I just edit around 
here. You wouldn't want me to 
censor poor Alter, would you? 
Would you? — Baen 

“If they conform so easily, Geis, 
in dress, it indicates they can and 
do write what they think will thrill 
the highbrow literary critics and the 
professors. They lust to be Re- 
spectable. And they edit to be Re- 
spectable and Accepted as Litera- 
ture.” 

“And you figure the ordinary 
reader is forgotten? You think he 
rarely gets the kind of science 
fiction that would really turn him 
on and bring him to the pocket- 
book racks and magazine racks 
screaming for more?” 

“On the nailhead, Geis! These 
people are often excellent to bril- 
liant writers, but they don’t really 
want to put their talents and skills 
to the service of readers by writing 
dynamic stories that grab us, keep 
us glued to the pages with action, 
danger, suspense and a touch of 
sex, and a heavy life-and -death 
crisis with the good guy winning in 
the end. They — ” 

“You can’t expect every story to 
conform to that formula, Alter!” 


THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 


145 



“Of course not!! The point is 
that these people are too good to 
‘prostitute' themselves to the 
masses. They want to do their 
thing, and be With It and In and 
have some graduate student or pro- 
fessor write articles and mono- 
graphs and theses on the deep 
philosophical significance of their 
work.” 

“You’re perhaps a little bit right, 
Alter, but you’re overstating and 
exaggerating all over the place.” 

“That’s the function of a Dia- 
tribe! I’m letting your hair down 
and you can’t stand it. Take a tran- 
quilizer and hold onto your hat. 
Will you please keep that geek you 
brought down here with you on his 
feet? Where was I?” 

“I refuse to tell you.” 

“You know why there’s such a 
high turnover in editors in publish- 
ing houses and magazines? It’s a 
rare editor who will learn from ex- 
perience. He usually insists on pub- 
lishing what he thinks the public 
should read. When sales go down 
or don’t improve, the publisher 
sacks him and brings in another 
guy with another slightly different 
set of pre-conceived ideas of what 
the public should read. When an 
editor does learn from the readers 
what the readers want, and gives it 
to them, he lasts thirty years and 
dies in his editorial chair, and then 
everyone calls him a genius in 
public and in private they sneer at 
him for ‘appealing to the lowest 
common denominator’.” 


“Yeah. Okay, Alter, you’ve said 
your piece. Now I’ve got to get back 
to the surface and take care of 
other matters.” 

“Not so fast, Geis! You don’t 
shut me up so easily this time! You 
started this! You wanted to display 
me, flaunt me before thousands, 
make fun of me, be superior, and 
now we’ll see how much guts you’ve 
got! I’m going to name names! How 
many enemies you want to make? 
Give me a few more pages — ” 

“Alter, the science fiction world 
is small and intimate. If I really let 
you go all the way . No, we must 
be diplomatic. We must — ” 

“Take Brian W. Aldiss, for in- 
stance. Here’s a man who wrote 
some really fine, sense-of-wonder 
s-f in the beginning of his career. I 
remember particularly the long 
AFTERNOON OF EARTH as a 
stunning view of far-future Earth, 
almost a fantasy of strangeness in a 
dominating plant world in which 
tiny tribal mankind is constantly 
struggling to survive amidst con- 
stant danger. Yet it’s an upbeat, 
triumphant story. 

“But he turned to experimenta- 
tion and self indulgence with novels 

like REPORT ON PROBABILITY A 
which sank without a trace, and the 
brilliant but narrow-of-appeal 
play-on-words and psychedelia, 
BAREFOOT IN THE HEAD. He then 
tired of s-f and said unkind, de- 
risive things about it and about 
fans. He turned to the ‘main- 
stream’ and hit it big with a mas-

turbation best-seller in England 
called hand-reared boy. But now 
he is back writing his brand of in- 
tellectual s-f — strange, eccentric 
satires and Literary games such as 

THE EIGHTY-MINUTE HOUR and 
FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND. 

“Alter, stop! Yug Suggol- 
plug . No, Yog Nuggle — ” 

“Or take a guy like Gene Wolfe. 
An excellent writer in the sense that 
he can write rings around most any- 
body in the field, but instead of 
applying that talent and skill to 
stories and novels that pin a reader, 
rattle his teeth and put him 
through a wringer, he writes techni- 
cally superb mile-long vignettes 
that drive me and others up the 
wall with puzzles and unanswered 
questions.” 

“He wins awards, Alter!” 

“So do you, Geis, and you know 
what a lot of fans think of you. 
Gene Wolfe wins awards for his 
pure writing ability, not because his 
stories are satisfying to anyone . 
except six or seven critics and a few 
professors and fellow-traveling 
editors. Most voters in these awards 
probably vote for him to avoid ad- 
mitting to themselves that they 
don’t understand his stuff. Ob- 
scurantism has its virtues in the 
Literary Game. He writes his way 
and 5% of the readers may like it or 
admire it without understanding it 
and the rest are either intimidated 
by his reputation or having once 
sampled his writing, stay clear ever 
after. He writes real-life reality,

“Because you’re obtuse and low- 
brow and were raised on the old 
pulp magazine . thud and 
blunder . .” 

“Damn right. Now tell me again 
how you understand the signifi- 
cance of Gene Wolfe’s ‘ The Fifth 
Head of Cerberus ’ and the related 
novelettes.” 

“His meanings are perfectly ob- 
vious to anyone who is willing to 
work at it. Slothful readers who 
want only to indulge themselves in 
entertainment will, of course, find 
him hard going. He demands 
thought and insight and careful, 
considered reading.” 

“You make my point, Geis. He 
writes college-course fiction. You 
have to study him. He has to be in- 
terpreted and analyzed. How 
delightful for him. He owes the 
reader nothing, right? The guy who 
pays good money gets the intellec- 
tual shaft, right?” 

“Alter, you are slipping into side 
areas. If you insist on continuing 
this Diatribe of yours — and you 
must know it isn’t new; anti-intel- 
lectuals and conservatives and 
Romantics have been making these 
same arguments for a hundred or 
more years — get back to ruining me 
among my friends. Attack some- 
body else.” 

“How about Gordon Eklund? 
He’s often as frustrating, anti-hero 


and knee-jerk anti-establishment 
and depressingly conformist in his 
intellectual s-f as most of the new 
young talented writers. You can 
add Ed Bryant, Thomas Disch, 
Geo. Alec Effinger, Vonda Mc- 
Intyre . Delaney . the list 
could go on and on.” 

“They are artists in words, 
Alter!” 

“They are giving their visions of 
reality, Geis. Which everyone does. 
But they are doing it by using the 
forms and styles of Literary Fiction, 
not reader-oriented Commercial 
Fiction. They say their way is 
superior to the commercial way, the 
reader-entertainment way, and I 
say they are affected, self-indul- 
gent, lazy, pretentious . and in 
the coming recession /depression 
the readers will triumph and these 
guys will either apply themselves to 
pleasing the readers or they’ll 
starve.” 

“You’re vicious!” 

“Damn right. The publishers 
will look at the sales charts and say, 
‘J.G. Ballard sells 2,000 copies. 
Roger Zelazny sells 200,000 copies. 
We can’t afford to carry Ballard 
anymore. Times are tough. We’ve 
got to cut these authors no one 
buys.’ In fact, that reality is be- 
ginning to appear now.” 

“Why haven’t you mentioned 
Barry Malzberg?” 

“Actually, because Barry is on 
his way out as a s-f writer. He is 
into the mainstream, if they’ll have 
him. He is so sick of s-f that his dis-

gust is nearly pathological. I must

say— 

“He wrote herovit’s world to 
express his disgust, didn’t he?’’ 

“ — a few words about that 
puffed-up frog in his Polish puddle, 
Stanislaw Lem, with his lovely cap- 
tive audiences, his inch-deep 
characterizations, his metaphysical 
novels dressed in hard-science 
clothes, his heavy-handed, over- 
written satire. 

*Groan* “Anyone else? Care to 
attack Heinlein while you’re at it?” 
“Heinlein isn’t an Intellectual 
s-f writer as I define the term. He 
incorporates large chunks of 
philosophy in his works, but he 
commits the cardinal sins of 
making himself understood and 
usually writing to entertain his 
readers. For this he is attacked. I 
haven’t thought too much of his 
last two novels, time enough for 
love has flashes of great narrative, 
but too much of it is Heinlein play- 
ing solipsistic masturbation games 
with Heinlein; it was so cute in 
places I wanted to vomit.” 

“I think you’d really better stop 
now, Alter. You’ve used up the 
whole column with your intemper- 
ate, ill-considered mouthings, and 
I did not intend for this to happen. 
Besides, my guest is shaking like a 
leaf and his skin has a strange 
pallor.” 

“Hand him a copy of Lin 
Carter’s last Thonger novel. The 
stink will—” 

“My God, Alter! You actually 


enjoy engaging authors and getting 
me into trouble, don’t you?” 

“Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. 
Life is short and ennui is long. Let’s 
say what we really think once in a 
while, with no self-censorship. 
With the clear expectation that 
we’ll get clobbered in turn. It’s fun. 
It’s good therapy to vent the spleen 
and pour icky green bile over every- 
thing every so often.” 

“I’ve spent years building an 
image of Nice Guy and you’ve de- 
stroyed it in one afternoon.” 
“There, there, Geis. Don’t 
whimper. From now on you’ll have 
a new image — you’ll be thought of 
as a combination of Jack Woodford 
and H. L. Mencken.” 

“I’m not going to visit you again, 
Alter! You’ll rot down here!” 
“You’ll be back! The next time 
you need a column written . the 
next time you need excitement in

A gristly little tale 


ARSEN DARNAY 


I ard Fatta Gut, Gourmand 
j Extraordinary, but lately re- 
turned from the Conquest of the 
Capon, unsated by victories over 
Turtle Zoup and the Filly of Mig- 
non, stood in the cavernously 
empty hall of Castle Krunch on 
Hunger Hill in Famine Plain and 
shook his round head slowly. 

“Nay, nay, my lady,” said he to 
pale, skinny Lady Diet whose shrill 
entreaties he’d endured too long, 
too long. “Leave us be, lady. 
Empty and enervating is the life of 
ease. I long for palpitating battle. 
My manly heart pines for the culi- 
nary joust.” 

And with those words he shuffled 
off slowly, his legs wide apart, for 
they didn’t call Lard Fatta Gut 
Lard Fatta Gut for nothing. His 
short, thick arms extended at an 
angle from his marvelously rounded 
trunk, and little wheezes escaped 
his parted lips. 

H is skinny lady’s bony fingers 
tore the tearstained handker- 
chief in rage. 

“Wretch, wretch,” she hissed be- 
hind him through narrow, blue 
lips, and the fire in her hollow 


sockets grew piercing. “Never more 
will 1 endure your faithless esca- 
pades. This time, my Lard, I’ll 
send my vengeance on you!” 

She ran off, wan-limbed, to her 
chamber. 

Her fingers fumbled angrily 
among her magic pills and potions. 
Kalorie killers and chalkbread 
sticks fell drily from her narrow 
table. Then with triumph she lifted 
two phials of closely sealed glass 
against the candle, and her eyes 
gleamed with bitter joy. 

“Come Vengeance Wreakers, 
come,” she hissed, and she ran to 
her laboratory where, pouring phial 
contents into an earthernware 
bowl, she whimpered incantations. 

Clouds of acid mingled with 
clouds of liquid fire, and in their 
smoky murk, coaxed by her words 
of power, the Dreadful Twins 
materialized in trembling simili- 
tude. 

“Who dares to summon the 
Double Scourge of the Columbian 
Continent?” they grated with a 
single, shardy voice. 

“It is I, the Lady Diet, immune 
to your foul works. I will release 
you on condition that you will harry 


151 



my Lard Gut until he mends his 
way. Even now he prepares to scale 
Mount Deli in Kosher Plain to test 
the mettle of Mighty Matz.” 

“Give the releasing word, my 
lady,” they rasped in eager unison. 
And she said: “McDonalds.” 
With shrieks of demonic fury, 
they streaked out through the 
vaulted window and past a weird- 
ling moon. Hunger ravens fluttered 
up weakly from the Starvation 
Oak. 


I n the empty castle courtyard six- 
teen henchmen heaved and hoist- 
ed Lard Fatta Gut up on the back 
of Bill O’Fare, his trusty steed. 

They tied magic Nap Kin be- 
neath his triple chin. They girded 
his rotundity with the jousting belt. 
On it from a leather scabbard hung 
his mighty weapon, golden Gorge- 
nor. On it from a silken thread 
hung his silver Fill Thee Cup. 

“Bon Ape Tit,” the henchmen 
cried grinning, and Bill O’Fare 
lurched out on buckling legs, sorely 
tried by my Lard Gut’s truly stu- 
pendous tonnage. 

Night cut off the last slice of day, 
and the horizon pinked like rare 
prime rib of beef. Locust swarms, 
Lard Fatta’s close familiars, 
whisked and rattled over the dry 
ground behind him. He broke into 
his mighty jousting song: 


Oh, what a glorious meal! 

Shish Kabob, ham, and tender 
young veal, 

Let us fall to with unequaled 
zeal, 

Pass the butter and slice the seal, 

And make those potatoes 
mashed. 

Eat, fellows, eat, 

Chew, fellers, cheat, 

Who minds the heat in the 
ki-i-it-chen! 

Hamburgers, hotdogs, catchup, 
and salt, 

Oh, what a glorious feast! 

Onions, pickles, and chips at the 
least, 

Fritos and cornballs and rolls full 
of yeast. 

That’s just a start for a ravenous 
beast, 

And pass that bottle of malt. 

Eat, fellows, eat, 

Chew, fellers, cheat, 

Who minds the heat in the 
ki-i-it-chen! 

He sang so long and with such 
fervor, he didn’t hear the Torture 
Twins’ shriek and cackle high up in 
the darkened sky, nor did he see 
past the flesh pillows around his 
greedy eyes the evil phosphores- 
cence of That Pair against the 
stars.

high. Pickle Palace proudly pouts 
on top. Salami columns support a 
cracker roof. Red gleams the beet 
soup in the moat. 

Thither trysted Lard Fatta Gut, 
growing nearly weightless with de- 
sire. Bill O’Fare felt his master’s 
levity and broke into a gallutton. 
They pounded down Sugar Cube 
Road and left a white dust behind 
them. Davy’s henchmen blocked 
the way, but Fatta Gut uncorked 
them all and drained their sweet 
life to the bottom. Up they 
thundered toward the palace, giddy 
with the blood of Mogan. The 
locust swarm came close behind. 

Unsheathing golden Gorgenor, 
Lard Fatta leapt from saddle just as 
Gefilte Fish cranked up the 
pumpernickel draw. 

“Yield!” cried Gut and brand- 
ished the mighty Fork. “Yield, I 
say, delicious men of Deli. Nothing 
shall daunt your Fatta Gun in his 
pursuit of Mighty Matz whom you 
dare guard in his goetic glass. Gor- 
genor has conquered many. Even 
now I come to you from the finger- 
licking haunts of Colonel Capon; 
Turtle Zoup has paid me homage; 
and I have caught the Filly of 
Mignon.” 

But the guards of Matz, the men 
of Deli, smiled behind uplifted 
hands. They knew themselves se- 
cure. Had not the Dreadful Twins 
arrived to take up posts behind the 
necromantic glass of Matz, hidden 
from sight, they and their minions? 
No more would smacking Fatta 


Gut ravage the countryside and 
make the jellies and the puddings 
quake in fear. 

“Away, you Gut profane,” they 
taunted. “Away, away.” 

“Alas,” cried he. “You won’t 
yield peacefully, I see. I pity you,” 
cried he, “for you shall feel the bite 
of golden Gorgenor.” 

And with these words he plunged 
into the moat and drank it dry in 
one, great, slurping gulp. Magic 
Nap Kin curled up to dab his 
puckered lips. 

Then did Gorgenor do deeds of 
valor. He cut, swung, jabbed, and 
skewered — guided by Lard Fatta 
Gut’s infallibly sure arm. Gefilte 
Fish fell to his blows. Hissing 
noodles curled on his prongs and 
were consumed. He blasted blintzes 
and quartered them for quick dis- 
patch. The Fork did work like 
seven forks, and though the Deli 
disgorged more warriors yet, not 
once did Gut’s sure chops and stabs 
miss an opponent. Nap Kin flapped 
madly to purify Gut’s lips and 
jowls, and on its magic surface 
deeds of courage were marked in 
gore. 

Slowly they struggled, Lard Fatta 
Gut and trusty Gorgenor, toward 
the Prize of Prizes, gigantic Matz in 
his goetic glass. There he is, up 
ahead, beyond the wrinkled pickle 
guard that now, overcome at last, 
fearfully withdraws into salami 
shadows. And our hero stands 
spread -legged before the glass, out- 
stretched arm at rest on Gorgenor’s 


GUT IN PERIL 


153 



golden handle, a smile of triumph 
on his smacking lips. 

M ighty Matz was a fat ball in- 
deed. He looked down at 
Fatta Gut with eyes of sleepy 
menace, languid and relaxed in his 
bath of rich, briny broth, for Matz 
knew what Gut didn’t. Those Two 
lurked in the gloom behind the 
glass. 

“I have cornered you at last, 
ball-shaped Matz. Uncap your jar, 
delicious friend, and come out for a 
final match of strength. As you can 
see, we’ve made a hash of your re- 
tainers, the golden Fork and I, and 
nothing guards you now.” 

“Wrong!” blurbed the blob in 
brine. “Wrong you are, my worthy 
Gut. Your battle has barely begun, 
and you’ll be bested this time.” 
Then with infernal shrieking 
noises, the Potent Pair pounced on 
our peerless Gut, one from the 
right and one from the left of the 
goetic glass, each circumswarmed 
by minions. 

Lard Fatta Gut lurched back 
under attack, his small eyes big 
with shocked surprise. 

“Gassidus Indigestus!” 

He nearly stammered as he 
pointed golden Gorgenor at one of 
the pair — a pin-eyed, evil, smoking 
wraith whose fingertips sprayed 
acid droplets toward the lard. 

“Hart Burn!” he cried, shifting 
his astonished gaze toward the 
other, a flaming replica of the 
romantic muscle on legs, whose 


fingers threw fire tongues toward a 
stumbling, retreating Gut. 

Their minions swarmed about 
him burning with liquids and 
gases. Once more Gorgenor slashed 
and stabbed — his golden prongs 
immune to acid but sweating in the 
flame — but nothing could prevail 
against the demonic fury of this 
Pair, and Lard Fatta Gut fell back 
in tottering despair. 

“Sorcery!” he cried aghast. “Un- 
fair joust. My manly honor is out- 
raged. I am undone.” 

J ust then, as luck would have it, 
as Gassidus and Hart closed in 
to kill, as Nap Kin curled brown 
with acid burn, the Locust Leader 
leaped up to perch on Fatta Gut’s 
blubbery earlobe, and in the 
scrape-tongue of the Familiar, it re- 
minded Fatta of his secret powers. 

The locust said: “Crrrp-twrrrp, 
crrp-twrrrrp, crurrp.” That is to 
say: “Look in your jousting belt, 
my lard, and remember also your 
invisible friend — for surely you are 
amply armed against the viles of 
Sorcery both by the works of 
Science and by the works of 
Nature.” 

Lard Fatta’s eyes lit up with joy. 
He moved his closed lips with one 
of his stout fingers while he emitted 
a sound. He said: “Buwlbuwlbuwl- 
buwlbuwlbuwlbuwl.” That is to 
say: “Thank you most graciously, 
Locust Leader, for reminding me of 
my superiority to Sorcery of all 
kinds, for truly I had thought my- 


154 


IF 



self undone, even while relief was a 
close as the reach of my fingers.” 

All through this exchange, of 
course, golden Gorgenor continued 
to thrust and parry, moved by 
Fatta’s unexcelled sure arm, and 
had it not been for the Fork’s un- 
daunted power. Lard Fatta Gut 
would have succumbed to Sorcery, 
for he needed a moment of respite 
to launch the devastating counter- 
attack he planned with a sly glint in 
his eye. 

Fortunately, Gorgenor’s flurry of 
gold beat back Gassid and Hart 
long enough. 

Already sensing his certain vic- 
tory, Lard Fatta Gut cried: “Not 
yet, my friends! Not yet shall you 
have your evil way with me, Dread- 
ful Scourge of Columbus’ Land!” 

And with these words, he reach- 
ed down and lifted his cup by its 
silken thread. 

“Cuplet Fill Thee,” whispered 
our stalwart, but nothing appeared 
in the silvery bottom of the con- 
tainer. His little eyes clouded with 
puzzled dismay. Again the Locust 
Leader twirped the answer, and 
Fatta Gut recalled the magic 
words. “Fill Thee Cuplet,” he 
whispered this time, and Lo! cool 
water brimmed to the top of the 
beaker. 

He took from his jousting belt’s 
secret pocket tablets shaped and 
colored like the pregnant moon. 
Into the cup they fizzed with magic 
abandon, and to the shrieking con- 
sternation of that Torturing Two, 


A1 Kasell’s pearly-white apparition 
rose from the Fill Thee Cup holding 
back six slavering acid gobblers on 
the end of a straining leash. Kasell 
released his hounds, and they 
began to consume many more acid 
minions than the Leading Dry 
Tablet that gourmands not-so- 
extraord inary used. 

Lard Fatta Gut began to rub his 
stomach with a circular motion, 
and again a shriek of anguished 
terror rose from the Terrible Twins, 
for they recognized the gesture and 
its threat. Sneaky, silent, cunning, 
and invisible, Fikel Mart — more 
dreadful than his loud-mouthed 
brothers — would even now curl in 
fhe air toward them choking off 
breath with his gaseous claws. 

They fled through the cracker 
roof with wails of impotent rage 
and disappeared, streaks of menac- 
ing phosphorescence, into the 
night. 

Mart and Kasell made short 
work of the abandoned minions, 
while Fatta Gut cast pillowed eyes 
toward the goetic glass. 

But Mighty Matz had fled his 
broth. Gut saw him roll flacidly 
between salami columns down the 
pumpernickel hall, a glistening and 
delicious ball, and Lard Fatta Gut 
hoisted Gorgenor, the golden Fork, 
for the final reckoning. 


The End.

This is absolutely the last word (J 
promise) on “ Cantor's War' 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

To one who grew up reading the 
editorials of the late John W. 
Campbell, Jr., and who, with Mr. 
Campbell’s death, had begun to 
feel that something comforting and 
predictable had gone out of life, it 
is a consolation to see that his most 
cherished supersi tion continues to 
be disseminated in the mags. I 
refer, of course, to the belief that a 
formal education consists largely in 
having Truths That Must Not Be 
Questioned Because They Were 
Discovered By Great Authorities 
shoved down one’s throat (or 
Throat) by Those Who Have The 
Proper Professional Credentials To 
Pass On The Revealed Truth. Mr. 
Christopher Anvil, a True Believer 
(as he might put it) in this hoary 
guff, goes through the old paces in 
“Cantor’s War” with enough verve 
to keep me in nostalgia till they re- 
issue the Edsel. I’m not ungrateful , 
mind, but the interests of truth 
(and of national defense, in case we 
should ever get into a war involving 
an infinite number of spaceships) 
compel me to point out that Mr. A. 
Comes a cropper over infinity. (A 


cropper, incidentally, that Dr. A, 
would never have come — value of 
professional credentials?) 

( For reasons of brevity I have 
been forced to delete here an 
exceedingly abstruse and (( accord- 
ing to a mathematical friend)) valid 
demonstration leading to the 
following conclusion. — Ed.) 

We suppose that each ship is 
capable of any finite velocity, and 
therefore, that each ship is capable 
of reaching its assigned volume in 
(drawing a figure from the story) 20 
seconds. Then, after 20 seconds, 
every one of the volumes will con- 
tain three Good Guys, though each 
contained only one before; yet the 
number of Good Guys does not in- 
crease, however hard Anvil finds 
that to swallow. So Anvil is wrong 
and Dr. Phipps is right — Ah, re- 
bellious creature of fiction! 

Oddly enough, however, Anvil is 
right — right in practice, though 
wrong in theory. That is, his rea- 
soning is wrong, but he gets the 
right strategic conclusion — that 
Dr. Phipps’s plan is worthless — by 
accident. The real problem with the 
Phipps plan is not one of troop- 
strength, as Anvil thinks, but of 
logistics. Consider the fact that 
each ship must determine where it 
is to go. The ship in volume 
number 4216, for example, must 
figure out for itself that it is to go to 
volume number 1409. It must also 
determine how far from 4216, and 
in what direction, 1409 is. To per- 
form these tasks, the ship must, of 
course, know that, at the start, it is 
in volume number 4216. Well, pre- 
sumably it does. But most of the 
ships don ’t know their own volume- 
numbers: most of the numbers are 


156 



too big for any entity this side of an 
omniscient Deity to “know.” Con- 
sider a ship whose volume-number 
contains 10 10 0 digits. How does the 
ship store such a number? Not even 
coded into the spins of all its con- 
stituent elementary particles. There 
aren’t nearly enough. And only an 
infinitesimal fraction of the 
volume-numbers are so minuscule 
as to be representable in 10 1000 or 
fewer digits. 

For Phipps’s plan to work, each 
ship would have to contain a com- 
puter capable of storing integers of 
any length, and capable of carrying 
out complex navigational calcula- 
tions with them in some fixed, 
finite period of time. That would be 
hard to believe, even in an s-f story.

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Ever since I started reading 
science fiction back in the summer 
of 1968 I have been collecting all 
the sf books and magazines I could 
get my hands on. I enjoyed Galaxy 
and //'immensely under Pohl, read- 
ing every story in every issue. 

However, after Fred Pohl 
stepped down I eventually found 
myself merely collecting the 
issues — only rarely was there 
anything worth reading. 

Now that you have taken over. 
I’ve been finding the magazines, 
once again, to be highly readable. 
The improvements so far have been 
great. The magazines, with their 
new departments, have become 
more relevant to what I feel sf is all 
about. 

I am glad that you are publishing

good sf of the Sense-of- Wonder 
variety (more of Niven!). While I 
believe in literary standards that 
are as high as possible (shades of 
Sturgeon!), I see no reason why this 
should conflict with the sense of 
wonder (look at Clarke). 

Exotic planets, infinite Cosmos, 
magnificent spaceships, mysterious 
aliens, fantastic gadgets — hell, I 
love that stuff! For me, this is what 
sf is ultimately all about. I hope you 
will keep on publishing this sort of 


sf. 


You have my best wishes (and 
moral support, for what it’s worth) 
during your editorship of Galaxy 
and If. 

Yours truly,

Dear Jim, 

Since you’ve been editing 
If/Galaxy we readers have been 
getting some real treats like the 
June All-Star issue and the new 
columns (I enjoy The Alien View- 
point tremendously). It seems 
Lester’s “Reading Room,” Ted’s 
“Galaxy Bookshelf’ and Jerry 
Pournelle’s “Step Farther Out” are 
getting better each issue but I miss 
Sf Calendar). 

I was going to suggest that you 
have a column written by writers 
about Sci/Fi (like you had Fred 
Pohl write in June IF) but I can see 
you already thought of that (the 
Forum column). I was also going to 
suggest a bio column but you 
thought of that, too (Interface). 

That is why I’m subscribing to 
IF; you thought of everything a 
reader could dream of! 


The Best of Luck, 
Michael Donnelly 
Hellertown, Pa. 

Thank you! 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Let me extend my congratula- 
tions on becoming editor of Galaxy 
and //magazines and turning them 
from being bland and lifeless fare 
into a real treat I eagerly look for- 
ward to every month. Why I’d even 
extend my subscription if I could be 
sure of regular delivery. 

You have done this primarily by 
instituting an editorial presence 
through a letters column and 
editorial expression and by special 
features which liven up interest be- 
yond strictly the fiction published. 
I’m looking at the August 1974 
issue of //'and am impressed with a 
number of things like the new 
science editors article — not • that 
I’m especially fascinated by the 
more detailed discussions of 
advances made in the physical 
sciences but I do like to know when 
anything important like impending 
fusion power comes about. 

The real treat though is Dick 
Geis’ column about typical Geisian 
things which perk up my interest a 
great deal usually no matter what 
opinion he expounds. Without be- 
ing blaringly egotistical in spouting 
off about his likes and dislikes he 
manages to present clear headed 
educated viewpoints on all manner 
of topics. While I certainly don’t 
agree with him all the time I respect 
his point of view. 

Other columns such as Del Rey’s 
Reading Room and the presenta- 
tion of a single piece of art sans 
blurb are both appreciated.

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I have noted with pleasure the 
great improvement in If since you 
became its editor. In so noting I 
have put my money where my 
mouth is and subscribed. 

There are only two minor sugges- 
tions that come to mind: 

(1) Place the subscription coupon 
back-to-back with your “Galaxy/ 
If S-F Mart” page. This would 
allow one to cut it out without 
doing any substantial damage to 
the magazine, for those of us who 
care about such things and not 
force us to resort to a Xerox 
machine. 

(2) Have a different illustration 
of “the alien” by Tim Kirk for each 
article of “The Alien Viewpoint.” 
He is undoubtedly the descendant 
of the cosmographer who appears 
on the dust jacket of “An Atlas of 
Fantasy.” He strikes a cord which 
brings much pleasure. 

Looking forward to an entertain- 
ing two years of If, I remain 

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I would like to echo the senti- 
ments of many speculative-fiction 
fans in congratulating you on the 
outstanding job you have done with 
Galaxy and If in the few short 
months you have edited these pub- 


lications. For the past few years I 
have avidly read all of the science- 
fiction magazines that I could find. 
It didn’t take me long to grow 
tired of Galaxy and If Pardon my 
frankness. 

However, since you have taken 
over, so to speak, they have become 
what 1 think are the two best maga- 
zines in science fiction. The new 
features are magnificent, especially 
Jerry Pournelle’s “A Step Farther 
Out” column. All in all, two great 
magazines. 

I would also like to comment on 
Jeff Hudson’s letter in the 
September Galaxy. I read his story 
in the August If with much delight, 
and feel that I must congratulate 
him on leaving the ranks of the 
“heretofore unpublished nobod- 
ies.” That is a clan which I am also 
attempting to depart. 

To get to the point, the thing that 
I want to comment on is the 
statement Mr. Hudson made con- 
cerning the writers he wanted to 
hear more of. He named Fritz 
Leiber, Algis Budrys, Chip De- 
laney, Ursula LeGuin, James Tip- 
tree, Jr., Philip Jose Farmer and 
the infamous Harlan Ellison. 

By some wild coincidence, all of 
the above are among my favorite 
writers, and the last two are my 
very favorites. Here’s to you, Mr. 
Hudson, you’re a man after my own 
heart! 

And here’s to you, Mr. Baen, for 
the fantastic job you’re doing with 
your two magazines. Keep up the 
good work. 

Sincerely, 
Alan Jacobs
