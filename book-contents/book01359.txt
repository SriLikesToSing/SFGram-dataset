EDITOR’S R\GE 



The Dream Keepers 



E ighteen hundred tomor- 
row’s children had finished 
eating a dead thing. The air was 
thick with dreams. Something un- 
human was alive in the room and 
the dreamers all knew it. They 
were children only in terms of to- 
morrow — tonight they were age- 
less and bright. And old and 
young. 

Whatever was alive in that room 
had come at their bidding — as 
they themselves had come. They 
had the power to evoke — like so 
many witches — not only the Un- 
known and the Things That Were 
To Be but each other. And some- 
times all three were the same. 
Now everyone attending was what 
the others had called into being — 
they were each other’s creations — 
and out of the three hundred and 
sixty-five nights of the year this 
night was theirs. 

They had shed their other reali- 
ties like outergarments before en- 
tering the room and here no one 
knew them. They themselves did 
not know. 

They were wordmasters — there- 
fore futuremasters — and words 
flew in the room. Most were spo- 
ken by one of their number who 
stood in the light. The rest sat in 
the dimness, replete with and alert 
from the dead thing they had eat- 
en, waiting for their thing, their 
nightthing, to take shape. They 
knew it was there but not how it 
looked or felt to the senses. 



The scene ending the 1969 
World Science Fiction Convention 
banquet in St. Louis wore the aura 
of a seance — except that it had 
nothing to do with ghosts. Only 
the food had been dead. The peo- 
ple present belonged to tomorrow. 
They ranged from students 
through doctors, lawyers, educa- 
tors, to scientists and — topping all, 
of course — the writers and the fans 
who are the dream-keepers. 

They had paid brief honors to 
their quick yesterdays and were 
reaching for the future where 
none of them had been. And now 
their man in the light — Harlan 
Ellison — was calling down the 
hovering unhuman who was feed- 
ing in the air thick with dreams. 

He gave it a name — and down 
it came. Words flew and clashed, 
creating energy, friction and heat 
— for tomorrow can have no name. 
The unhuman gobbled the words 
and the dreams and the night 
grew gravid with Things To 
Come. 

And before that huge alive un- 
human unborn, tomorrow’s tu- 
multuous children grew silent. We 
filed out of the vast rooms, out of 
the dimness and the light — and I 
for one had the feeling that each 
had taken the dream of the one 
and made it his and her own. 

This page is for the man in the 
light, without whom many things 
would not be. 

— JAKOBSSON

HAPPINESS IS A 

WARM 



JAMES TIPTREE, Jr. 



SPACESHIP 



Every male aboard had 
a minority problem, a 
race problem — and the 
same damn girl problemi 




T he rainbow floods were 
doused. The station band had 
left. Empty of her load of cadets, 
the F.S.S. Adastra floated quietly 
against the stars. The display of 
First Assignments in the station 
rotunda was deserted. The crowd 
had moved to the dome lounge, 
from which echoed the fluting of 
girls, the braying and cooing of 
fathers, mothers, uncles and aunts, 
punctuated by the self-conscious 
baritones of the 99th Space Com- 
mand class. 

Down below, where the Base 
Central offices functioned as usual, 
a solitary figure in dress whites 
leaned rigidly over the counter of 
Personnel. 

‘‘You’re absolutely certain 
there’s no mistake?” 

“No, it’s all in order. Lieutenant 
Quent.” The girl who was coding 
his status tabs smiled. “First offi- 
cer, P.B. Ethel P. Rosenkrantz, 
dock eight-two, departs seventeen 
thirty — that’s three hours from 




now. You have to clear Immuni- 
zation first, you know.” 

Lieutenant Quent opened his 
mouth, closed it, breathed audibly. 
He picked up the tabs. 

As he strode away a tubby man 
wearing a Gal News badge trotted 
up to the counter. 

“That lad is Admiral Quent’s 
son. What’d he get, Goldie?” 

“I shouldn’t tell you — a peebee.” 
“A what? No!” 

She nodded, bright-eyed. 
“Sweetheart, I’ll name you in 
my will!” He trotted off. 

In the medical office Quent was 
protesting, “But I’ve had all my 
standard shots a dozen times!” 

The M.O. studied a data display 
which stated, among other things, 
that Quent was a Terra-norm hu- 
man male, height 1.92 m., skin 
Cauc tan, hair Br., eyes Br., dis- 
tinguishing marks. None. The data 
did not mention a big homely jaw 
and two eyebrows which tended 
to meet in a straight line. 

“What’s your ship? Ah, the 
Rosenkrantz, Take off your 
blouse.” 

“What do I need shots for?” 
persisted Quent. 

“Two fungus, one feline mu- 
tate, basic allergens,” said the 
M.O., briskly cracking ampoules. 
“Feline what?” 

“Other arm, please. Haven’t 
you met your fellow officers?” 

“I just got this rancid assign- 
ment twenty minutes ago.” 



“Oh. Well, you’ll see. Flex that 
arm a couple of times. It may 
swell a bit.” 

“What about my fellow offi- 
cers?” Quent demanded darkly. 

The M.O. cracked another am- 
poule and cocked an eye at the 
display. 

“Aren’t you the son of Admiral 
Rathborne Whiting Quent?” 

“What’s that got to do with my 
being assigned to a clobbing pee- 
bee?” 

“Who knows. Lieutenant? Poli- 
tics are ever with us. I daresay you 
expected something like the Sir- 
ian, eh?” 

“Well, men considerably below 
me on the ratings did draw the 
Sirian"" Quent said stiffly. 

“Clench and unclench that fist 
a couple of times. No, unclench it 
too. Tell me, do you share your 
father’s, ah, sentiments about the 
integration of the Federal Space 
Force?” 

Quent froze. “What the — ” 

“You’ve been in space a year. 
Lieutenant. Surely you’ve heard 
of the Pan Galactic Equality Cov- 
enant? Well, it’s being imple- 
mented, starting with a pilot inte- 
gration program in the peebees. 
Three of your future fellow offi- 
cers were in here yesterday for 
their pan-human shots.” 

Quent uttered a wordless sound. 

“You can put on your blouse 
now,” said the M.O. He leaned 
back. “Life’s going to be a bit 



6 



IF 




lumpy for you if you share your 
father’s prejudices.” 

Quent picked up his blouse. 

“Is it prejudice to think that 
everyone should have his own — ” 

“ ‘Do you want yolir boy’s life 
to depend on an octopus?’ ” re- 
cited the M.O. wryly. 

“Oh, well, there he went too 
far. I told him so.” Quent 
wrenched his way into his dress 
blouse. “I’m not prejudiced. Why, 
some of my — ” 

“I see,” said the M.O. 

“I welcome the opportunity,” 
said Quent. He started for the 
door. “What?” 

“Your hat,” said the M.O. 

“Oh, thanks.” 

“By the by,” the M.O. called 
after him, “Ga/ News will prob- 
ably be on your trail.” 

Q uent stopped in mid-stride 
and flung up his head like a 
startled moose. A small figure was 
trotting toward him down the cor- 
ridor. His jaw clenched. He took 
off down a side corridor, doubled 
through a restricted zone and gal- 
loped into the rear of the freight 
depot. 

He shoved his tabs at a gaping 
cargoman. “My dittybox, quick- 
ly-” 

Box in arms, he clambered into 
a cargo duct, ignoring the chorus 
of yells. He made his way down 
the treads until he came to an 
exit in the perimeter docks. He 



climbed out into the spacious ser- 
vice area of the Adastra from 
which he had debarked two hours 
before. 

The inlet guard grinned. “Com- 
ing back aboard. Lieutenant?” 

Quent mumbled and started off 
around the docking ring, lugging 
his box. He passed the immacu- 
late berths of the Crux, Enter- 
prise, Sirian, passed the gleaming 
courier docks, plodded on into 
sections crowded with the umbili- 
cal tubes of freighters and small 
craft and criss-crossed with cables 
and service rigging. He stumbled 
and was grazed by a mobile con- 
veyor belt whose driver yelled at 
him. Finally he came to an inlet 
scrawled in chalk “P B ROSEKZ”. 
It was a narrow, grimy tube. No- 
body was in sight. 

He set down his box and started 
in, trying not to rub his white 
shoulders against the flex. The 
tube ended in an open lock which 
gave directly into a small ward- 
room cluttered with parcels and 
used drinking bulbs. 

Quent coughed. Nothing hap- 
pened. 

He called out. 

A confused sound erupted from 
the shaftway opposite. It was fol- 
lowed by a massive rear end clad 
in shorts and a shaggy gray parka. 
The newcomer turned ponder- 
ously. Quent looked up at an ur- 
sine muzzle set in bristly jowls, a 
large prune of a nose. 



HAPPINESS IS A WARAASPACESHIP

“Who you?” demanded the ur- 
sinoid in thick Galactic. 

“Lieutenant Quent, First Offi- 
cer, reporting,” said Quent. 

“Good,” rumbled the other. He 
surveyed Quent from small bright 
eyes and scratched the hair on his 
belly. Quent had erred about the 
parka. 

“You know refrigerate for stor- 
age?” 

“Refrigerant?” 

“Come. Maybe you make some 
sense.” 

Quent followed him back into 
the shaftway and down a dark lad- 
der. Presently they came to a light 
above an open hatch. The ursinoid 
pointed to a tangle of dripping 
tubes. 

“What’s it for?” Quent asked. 

“Make cold,” growled the oth- 
er. “New model. Should not slob- 
ber so, VerntT' 

“I mean, what’s it refrigerat- 
ing?” 

“Ants. Here, you take. Maybe 
better luck.” 

He thrust a crumpled folder 
into Quent’s hand and shouldered 
past him up the ladder, leaving a 
marked aroma of wet bear rug. 

The leaflet was titled: Temper- 
ature-Controlied Personnel Sys- 
tem Mark X5 Series D, Mod., 
Appvl. Pdg. Quent peered into the 
hatch. Beyond the pipes was a dim 
honeycomb of hexagonal cubicles, 
each containing a dark bulge the 
size of a coconut. He heard a faint. 



chittering sound. Quent began to 
examine the dialed panel beside 
the hatch. It did not seem to match 
the leaflet diagram. Somewhere 
above him the ladder clanked. 

“Futile,” hissed a voice over- 
head. Quent looked up. A thin 
gray arm snaked down and 
plucked the folder from his grasp. 
Quent had a glimpse of bulging, 
membranous eyes set in a long 
skull. The head retracted and its 
owner clambered down. It, or he, 
was a lizardlike biped taller than 
Quent, wearing a complicated 
vest. 

“You are Quent — are new first 
officer,” the creature clacked. 
Quent could see its tongue flicker 
inside the beaked jaws. “I am 
Svensk. Welcome aboard. You will 
now go away while I adjust this 
apparatus before the captain bug- 
gers it completely.” 

“The captain?” 

“Captain Imray. Hopeless with 
mechanisms. Do you intend to re- 
main here chattering until these 
ridiculous ants decongeal?” 

Quent climbed back to the 
wardroom, where somebody was 
trying to sing. The performer 
turned out to be a short, furry 
individual in officer’s whites with 
his hat on the back of his head 
and a bulb of greenish liquor in 
one brown fist. 

“// pleut dans mon coeur com- 
me il pleut dans la ville"' caroled 
the stranger.

IF 




He broke off to pop round yel- 
low eyes at Quent. 

“Ah, our new first officer, is it 
not? Permit me.” Incisors flashed 
as he grabbed Quent by the shoul- 
ders and raked sharp vibrissae 
across Quent's cheeks. “Sylvestre 
Sylla, at your service.” 

Quent exposed his own square 
teeth. 

“Quent.” 

“Quent?” Sylla repeated. “Not 
Rathborne Whiting Quent, Ju- 
nior?” 

Quent nodded, coughing. The 
wardroom seemed to reek of musk. 

“Welcome aboard, First Officer 
Quent. Welcome to the Ethel P. 
Rosenkrantz, patrol boat. Not, of 
course, the Sirian'" Sylla said unc- 
tuously, “but a worthy ship, vov- 
ons. I trust you are not disap- 
pointed in your first assignment. 
First Officer Quent?” 

Quent’sjaw set. 

“No.” 

“Permit me to show you to your 
quarters. First Officer.” 

Sylla waved Quent to the upper 
ladderway, which opened from 
the wardroom ceiling. Above the 
wardroom was a section of cubi- 
cles for the crew, each accessible 
by a flexible sphincter port. Be- 
yond these the shaftway ended in 
the bridge. 

“Here you are. First Officer,” 
Sylla pointed. “And your luggage, 
sir?” 

“I left it outside,” said Quent. 



“Doubtless it is still there,” re- 
plied Sylla and dived gracefully 
through another sphincter. 

Quent climbed down and ex- 
ited from the tube in time to res- 
cue his dittybox from a grapple. 
As he wrestled it up the shaftway 
he could hear Sylla promising to 
defeather Alouette. 

T he cubicle proved to be 
slightly smaller than his cadet 
quarters on the Adastra. Quent 
sighed, sat down on his hammock 
gimbal, took off his hat and ran a 
hand through his hair. He put his 
hat back on and took out his pock- 
et recorder. The recorder had a 
played message tab in place. 
Quent flicked the rerun and held 
it to his ear. 

Ping-ping-ping, went the offi- 
cial channels signal. He heard a 
sonorous throat-clearing. 

“Congratulations on your Acad- 
emy record. Lieutenant. Your 
mother would have been, um, 
proud. Well done. And now,, good 
luck on your first mission. One 
that will, I trust, profoundly en- 
lighten you.” 

The recorder pinged again and 
cut off. Quent’s frown deepened. 
He shook his head slowly. Then 
he took a deep breath, opened his 
dittybox and rooted through a 
bundle of manuals. Selecting one, 
he pushed out through the sphinc- 
ter and climbed up to the bridge. 

In the command chair the ur- 



HAPPINESS IS A WARAASPACESHIP

sine Captain Imray was flipping 
fuel selectors and grunting into 
the engineroom speaker. Quent 
looked around the small bridge. 
The navigator’s console and the 
computer station were empty. A 
little old man in a flowered shirt 
sat in the commo cubby. He 
glanced around and batted one 
baggy eye at Quent, without ceas- 
ing to whisper into his set. He had 
a gray goatee and yellow buck- 
teeth. 

The first officer’s chair was be- 
side the shaft ladder. Quent re- 
moved a parcel from the seat, sat 
down and opened his manual. 
Captain Imray ceased grunting. 
Quent cleared his throat. 

“Shall I take over the check, 
sir? I gather you are go through 
phase twenty-six.” 

The ursinoid’s eyes widened. 

“Some help I get,” he boomed. 
“Sure, sure, you take.” 

Quent activated his console. 

“Gyro lateral thrust, on,” he 
said, manipulating the auxiliary. 

He heard no reply from En- 
gines. 

“Gyro lateral thrust, on,” 
Quent repeated, thumbing the 
engine-room channel. 

“Morgan don’t say much,” re- 
marked Captain Imray. 

“The engineering officer?” 
asked Quent. “But — but you 
mean he would respond if the 
function were negative, sir?” 

“Sure, sure,” said Imray. 



“Gyro torque amplifiers, on,^’ 
said Quent. Silence. “Primary im- 
peller circuit, live,” he continued 
grimly and worked on down the 
check. At: “Pod eject compensa- 
tor — ” a brief moan came from 
Engines. 

“What?” 

“Morgan says don’t bother him, 
he done all that,” Imray trans- 
lated. 

Quent opened his mouth. The 
main voder suddenly began bark- 
ing. 

“Control to peebee Rosy! pee- 
bee Rosy, prepare to clear dock at 
this time. Repeat, peebee Rosy to 
station north, go! peebee Kip 
four-ten, repeat, four-ten. Con- 
trol to peebee Kip, dock eight-two 
now clearing. Repeat, peebee Kip 
green for dock eight-two.” 

“Morgan, you hear?” boomed 
Imray. “We green for go, Mor- 
gan?” 

A faint squeal from Engines. 

“But Captain, we’re only at 
check-phase thirty,” said Quent 
and ducked as Lieutenant Sylla 
hurtled out of the shaft to land in 
the navigation console with a rat- 
tle of claws. Sylla slapped the 
screens to life with one hand 
while punching course settings 
with the other. Imray and the co- 
mo gnome were yanking at their 
webs. From below came the clang 
and hiss of the disengaging lock. 
The next instant the station grav- 
ity went off. 



10 



IF 




As Quent pawed for his own 
web he heard Imray bellowing 
something. The auxiliaries let in 
and the Ethel P. Rosenkrantz 
leaped to station north. 

Q uent hauled himself down 
to his chair, trying to orient the 
wheeling constellations on the 
screens. 

“How’s she look, Morgan?” 
Imray was asking. “Green we go 
out?” 

Another hoot came from En- 
gines. Sylla was smacking course 
settings with one furry fist. 

“Svensk! Appleby! You set?” 
Imray bawled. 

“But Captain — ” Quent pro- 
tested. 

Sylla kicked the fix pedal, twid- 
dled his calibrator and dropped 
the fist. 

^'‘GespruchV' roared Imray and 
slammed home the main drive. 

Quent’s head cleared. He was 
crosswise in his seat. 

“With no web is risky, son,” 
said Imray, shaking his jowls. 

“We weren’t due to go for 
forty-five minutes!” expostulated 
Quent. He righted himself as ac- 
celeration faded. “The check is 
incomplete, sir. Control had no 
‘right-’’ 

“Apparently the first officer did 
not hear the four-ten,” said Sylla 
silkily. 

“Four-ten?” 

“Four-ten is ship in bad trouble. 



must dock quick,” Imray told him. 

“But that should be three 
-three- delta- ex- four- one- otto 
point with the vessel’s designa- 
tion.” 

“Doubtless in the star class ves- 
sels First Officer Quent is used 
to,” said Sylla. “Here he will find 
life less formal.” 

“What was the four-ten, Pom?” 
called a clear sweet voice. 

Quent twisted. Looking up from 
beside his elbow was a dazzling 
girl-face framed in copper curls. 
Quent craned further. The rest of 
her appeared to meet the wildest 
demands of a man who had spent 
the last year on a training ship. 

“Huh?” he asked involuntarily. 

“Hi,” said the apparition, wav- 
ing her hand irritably in front of 
Quent’s nose and continuing to 
gaze at the commo officer. 

“The Kip"" said the little man 
over his shoulder. “That’s the pee- 
bee Kipsuga Chomo, sir,” he wag- 
gled his goatee at Quent. “Three 
hundred hours with some con- 
taminant gas. They sealed up in 
the bridge but Ikky had to bring 
’em in by himself. Not much air 
in these here peebees.” 

He turned back to his board. 

Quent glanced around. Three 
hundred hours was over two 
weeks. He shuddered. 

“But why didn’t — ” 

“Why did not someone come to 
their rescue?” Sylla cut in. “The 
first officer forgets. Patrol boats 



HAPPI NESS I S A WA RAA SPACESH I P

are the ones that go to the rescue. 
Who comes to aid a patrol boat? 
Only another patrol boat — in this 
case ourselves, who were sitting at 
Central awaiting our new first of- 
ficer. Tant pis, they were only a 
gaggle of nonhumans — ” 

Imray swatted the air crossly. 
“Now, now, Syll.” 

“Soup’s hot,” said the girl. 
“Ooh! My jam.” 

She reached a slim white arm 
around Quent’s ankles, Quent, 
tracking closely, saw that the par- 
cel he had displaced had collided 
with the gimbals — together with 
his hat — and was exuding a rosy 
goo. 

“Tchah!” She snatched it up 
and departed down the shaft. 

Quent picked up his hat and 
shook it. Jam drops drifted onto 
his leg. 

Captain Imray was clambering 
into the shaftway. 

“The first officer will take the 
first watch, is that not correct?” 
Without waiting for an answer 
Sylla sailed past the captain and 
vanished. Only the commo officer 
remained absorbed in his inaudi- 
ble dialog. 

Q uent collected the floating 
jam in his handkerchief and 
wedged the cloth under his seat. 
Then he kicked off on a tour of 
the cramped bridge. The screens 
were, he saw, inoperative under 
drive. He pulled up to the library 
computer and signaled for their 



course data display. Instead of the 
requested data the voder came on. 

I must go down to the seas 
again, for the call of the run- 
ning tide 

Is a wild call and a clear call 

Quent reached for the erase. 

“Don’t do that, sir,” the com- 
mo man said. 

“Why not? I want some data.” 

“Yes, sir. But that’s Lieutenant 
Sylla’s setup, sir. Very fond of wa- 
ter poetry, he is. Just leave it, sir. 
Lieutenant Svensk will get what- 
ever you want.” 

Quent glared at the computer, 
which was now reciting: 

D egged with dew, dappled 
with dew. 

Are the groins of the braes . 

He switched it off. 

“Perhaps you would be so good 
as to inform me of our course and 
of the parameters of our patrol 
sector?” he asked icily. “I am 
Lieutenant Quent, First Officer.” 

“Yessir, Lieutenant.” The little 
man’s face split in a grin that sent 
his goatee pointing at his buck 
teeth. “Pomeroy here, sir. Lester 
Pomeroy, Ensign. Sure is good to 
see a fellow human aboard, sir, if 
you don’t mind my saying so.” 

“Not at all. Ensign,” said 
Quent. 

“I guess maybe you feel a bit 
put out, sir,” Pomeroy went on in 



12 



IF 




a confidential tone. “Them en- 
aitches prob’ly never even intro- 
duced themselves — right, sir?” 
“Well, I haven’t had time to 
look over the roster yet.” 

“What roster?” Pomeroy chuck- 
led. “Anything you want to know, 
sir, just ask Pomeroy. You want to 
know the gen? Well, there’s Cap- 
tain Imray, he’s from Deneb way. 
Navigator, Lieutenant Sylla — I 
don’t know exactly where he’s 
frgm. He’s what they call a lutroid. 
Puts on terrible strong when he’s 
wrought up. And Lieutenant 
Svensk, he’s Science when he’s 
set low of course, and conversely 
he’s Guns when the need arises. 
His vest, see? And then there’s 
me for Commo and Morgan for 
Engines — he don’t say much. 
Wait till you meet Morgan. And 
there’s our combat team — but 
they don’t count.” 

“Why not?” asked Quent dazed- 
ly. 

Pomeroy gave a nervous giggle. 
“They’re froze, that’s why. And 
froze they’ll stay. Nobody wants 
to get them boys out.” 

“But I know the one you’re 
itching to meet. Lieutenant. Miss 
Mellicent Appleby, Logistical 
supply. Ain’t she a treat? Cooks 
up a storm, too. But there’s one 
thing she don’t supply, I better 
warn you, sir.” His grin faded. 
“She don’t supply no Appleby. 
So far, anyhow.” 

Pomeroy paused, waited. Quent 
said nothing. 



“Now, you ask about our patrol 
beat — no, sir,” The old man broke 
off as Quent moved to the display 
tank. “No use to try that, sir. 
Svensk has it stressed up as a 
psoodospace — some crazy snake 
game. But it’s simple. We’re Sec- 
tor Twelve, like a big piece of 
cake, see?” He gestured. “Here 
we are at the point. That’s Base 
Central. First stop is right close 
in — that’s Strugglehome. If they’re 
all green we go on to Davon Two. 
If they’re not hurting we swing 
over to Turlavon and Ed. And if 
nothing comes up we dock in at 
Midbase. If they haven’t any grief 
we hang around and check Route 
Leo — service the beacons and so 
forth — and then we hit the Chun 
Complex. That’s a mess. When 
we’re through there we make< the 
long hop out to Farbase — and if 
they’re all quiet we start on 
around through Goldmine and 
Tunney and Sopwith and so on, 
back home to Central. Eighteen 
mail colonies, one route and two 
bases. Takes about a hundred and 
twenty days, provided nothing 
comes up.” 

“What sort of thing is apt to 
come up, Mr. Pomeroy?” 

“Distress calls, wrecks, jitney 
duty for some royal groundhog 
going from here to there, wonky 
beacons, exploding mail, field 
freeze-ups, ghost signals, flying 
wombats — you name it, we get it 
sooner or later.” His poached eyes 
rolled mournfully. “We’re the

boys that do the dirty. If it’s too 
clobby to mess with, lay it on the 
peebees. Take our last tour. Every- 
thing was tight till we hit the 
Chung Complex. They got a crust 
instability on a little water planet 
and both their big ships blowed 
out on the other side of the sys- 
tem. So we have to ferry the 
bleeders off — and they won’t go 
without their livestock. Thirty- 
three days hauling octopuses, 
that’s what.” 

Quent frowned 

“In a Space Force vessel?” 

“Ah, them en-aitches don’t 
care,” Pomeroy grimaced. 

Quent kicked back to his chair 
in silence. 

“Never you mind. Lieutenant,” 
the little man commiserated and 
hoisted an amber bulb, his wrin- 
kled neck working. 

He wiped the bulb with his 
shirttail. 

“Have some Leo Lightning, 
sir?” 

“Quent jerked upright. “Drink- 
ing on the bridge?” 

Pomeroy winked broadly. 

“Captain Imray don’t care.” 

“Mr. Pomeroy,” said Quent 
firmly. “I appreciate your inten- 
tions — but there will be no drink- 
ing on this bridge while I am O.C. 
Kindly stow that bulb.” 

Pomeroy stared blankly. 

“Yes, sir,” he said at last and 
turned to his board. 



The bulb remained in plain 
sight. 

Quent opened his mouth, closed 
it. Muscles flickered in his square, 
unhandsome countenance. A cla- 
mor was rising from the wardroom 
below. Svensk’s clack, Sylla’s 
waspish tenor mingled with the 
captain’s boom. The officers on 
board were clearly not a harmoni- 
ous team. Presently they subsided 
and the ladder clanked as they re- 
tired to rest. " 

Quent sighed through his teeth 
and picked up the jam-spattered 
manual. The Ethel P. Rosenkrantz, 
of which he was first officer, was in 
full star drive with twenty-three 
essential operational procedures, 
all his responsibility, unchecked. 



II 

F ive hours later the ladder 
clanked again and the hulk of 
Captain Imray heaved up to the 
bridge. He was followed by Lieu- 
tenant Sylla in free glide. The lu- 
troid landed in his console with a 
passing flick that made Pomeroy 
jump for his bulb. 

“Twenty-twenty hours. First 
Officer Quent relieved by Cap- 
tain Imray,” said Quent formally 
to the log. 

“Sure, sure, I take her, son,” 
chuckled Imray, settling himself. 
“You go look Appleby, vernt?’*

IF 




“I am going to make a prelimi- 
nary inspection of the ship, Cap- 
tain.” 

“Good.” Imray beamed. “See 
how conscience the humans, Syll? 
From them example you could 
learn.” 

""Sans doute"' snarled Sylla. “It 
is also possible that our first officer 
feels a need to familiarize himself 
with the humble patrol boat. It 
perhaps did not engage his atten- 
tion during his training as a future 
star-class admiral.” 

“Now, Syll,” growled Imray. 

“Come on Lieutenant, sir,” 
Pomeroy pulled Quent’s sleeve. 

Quent’s right fist unballed slow- 
ly. He followed the little man into 
the shaft. ^ 

In the wardroom Pomeroy 
helped himself from a net of 
wrapped sandwiches and settled 
down with his bulb at the gim- 
baled table. Quent surveyed the 
room. It was a cylinder with walls 
composed of lockers in which, ac- 
cording to his manual, were stored 
suits, tools, repair and grappling 
rigs, fuse panels and oxy supply. 
These could be checked later. On 
his left was the lock and a slave 
screen, now blank. Across from 
the lock was a pantry cubby and 
the shaftway down which he had 
first followed Imray. 

Quent hustled to the shaft and 
started aft. The next section con- 
tained the main food stores, a 



small galley-cum-infirmary, waste 
intakes and the fore quadrant of 
the regeneration system which ran 
through several sections of the 
hull. He glanced through its hatch 
panel at a lighted mass of culture 
trays and continued along the dim 
shaft, vaguely aware that his feet 
were encountering a filmy sub- 
stance. He was now passing more 
sphincters which gave access to 
cubicles for transient passengers 
and package mail. 

“Must you trample on my laun- 
dry, Lieutenant?” inquired a so- 
prano voice in his ear. 

Miss Appleby’s head protruded 
from a port behind him. Her gaze 
was directed toward his leg, which 
seemed to be wrapped in tur- 
quoise silk. 

“Oh. Sorry.” He disentangled, 
trying not to kick. “I’m doing a 
tour of the ship.” 

“Well, do your touring some 
place else, please,” she said. 
“These are my quarters.” 

“All these?” He gestured. 
“When we haven’t any tran- 
sients, I don’t see why not.” 

He parted a port at random and 
looked in. The cubicle was draped 
in fluffy stuff and the hull wall 
sparkled with holograms. Quent 
had the impression of an offen- 
sively healthy character in cease- 
less action. He moved to another 
cubicle — it proved to be full of 
bundles tied with bows. Not mail. 



HAPPINESS IS A WARM SPACESHIP

He tried another. Miss Appleby’s 
head revolving as she watched 
him. This one held what appeared 
to be a private kitchen and it 
smelled of fudge. 

“These wires,” he called back 
to the head. “Are they author- 
ized?” 

“Captain Imray never objected. 
Please get on with it. I’m trying to 
take a bath.” 

Quent peered. There were in- 
deed rainbow droplets in the curls 
around her delicate ears. He 
licked his lips. 

“Yes, ma’am,” he said absently, 
drifting toward her. 

“By the way. Lieutenant,” said 
the charming head. “Did you no- 
tice those holos in there?” 

“Very nice.” He drifted faster, 
smiling. 

“Didn’t you recognize them?” 

“Should I?” he beamed. 

“Yes, I think so,” she said calm- 
ly. “That’s my fiance. Bob Coates- 
worth. Vice Admiral Robert B.* 
Coatesworth. Think it through. 
Lieutenant.” 

With a soft sucking sound her 
head fanished back into the cubi- 
cle. 

Quent halted. He pounded his 
fist, slowly against his head — sev- 
eral times. Then he resumed his 
journey aft. 

B eyond the bulkhead he 
found emergency pod inlets, 
which would require a careful 
check, and the refrigerant storage 



quadrant he had met before. He 
peered through the view panel. 
The drip seemed to have stopped. 

The regeneration chamber 
ended here, giving room for the 
landleg stabilizers and the Rosen- 
krantzs small-weapons turrets, all 
of which he would have to go over 
in detail later on. This ship was 
old. The manual referred to it as 
a heavy-duty, primitive type, 
equipped for planetside landings. 
Was the system still operational? 
Pomeroy had told him that their 
mail exchange was normally con- 
ducted from orbit. 

Through the next bulkhead the 
shaft opened into the echoing 
gloom of the main cargo hold. 
This felf'dank, perhaps in mem- 
ory of the octopi. He made his 
way along the hull past" the airsled 
and the cradles filled with mail 
pods. He gave the main cargo 
hatch a brief check and turned to 
the engineroom hatchway. 

The hatch refused to open. 

“First officer to Engineer,” he 
said to the speaker. “Open up.” 

The engineroom was silent. 

“The first officer speaking,” he 
said more loudly. “Open the 
hatch.” 

The speaker gave a squeal that 
sounded like, “Blow.” 

“What’s wrong?” Quent shouted. 
“Open up.” 

“Blo-oo-oo-ow,” moaned the 
speaker. 

“I’m inspecting the ship. Engi- 
neer, undog this hatch.” 



16 



IF 




No reply. 

Quent pounded on the grille. 

“First Officer Quent," said 
Sylla’s voice from the hold voder. 
“The captain requests that you 
cease annoying the engineer." 

“Fm not annoying the engineer. 
He won’t let me in." 

“Better you try some other 
time, son," said Imray’s rumble. 

“But— yes, sir," Quent gritted. 

He pounded his head again, less 
gently. Then he started back 
through the hold, pursued by the 
dim sound of bagpipes from En- 
gines. The shaft was now empty of 
Miss Appleby and her laundry. 
Pomeroy was still in the ward- 
room, nursing his bulb. 

“Morgan throw you out, sir? 
Them en-aitches got no respect." 

Quent silently helped himself 
to sandwiches and a tea bulb and 
rummaged through the casette 
locker until he recognized some 
Sector Twelve names — Struggle- 
home, Turlavon, the Chung Com- 
plex. He carried the lot to his cu- 
bicle, carefully stowed away his 
stained dress whites and slung his 
hammock cocoon. The sandwiches 
turned out to be delicious. Before 
he had heard through the data on 
Turlavon his eyelids closed. 

“Wake up, Lieutenant." 

Quent came to half out of his 
cubicle and with Pomeroy hang- 
ing onto his arm. 

“You was having nightmares, 
sir." 

The little man’s left eye seemed 



to be swelling shut. Across the 
way Svensk’s bony head poked 
out. Imray and Sylla were peering 
down from the bridge. They were 
all grinning. 

“Uh— sorry." 

Quent disengaged himself and 
pulled back into his cabin. 

“Orbit in an hour, sir," Pome- 
roy called. “Strugglehome." 

I N THE twenty ship days to 
Midbase Quent acquired consid- 
erable enlightenment. At Strug- 
glehome he asked Sylla to show 
him the mail-pod exchange rou- 
tine. Here he learned that the 
slow man on a pod grapple can get 
a set of mashed fingers. The lu- 
troid apologized effusively. By 
Davon Two Quent’s hand was in 
shape to help Svensk prepare a 
shipment from the culture cham- 
ber. The big saurian became ani- 
mated in the fetid warmth and 
treated Quent to a harangue on 
phytogentics. Quent finally told 
him to go away. He then learned, 
too late^ that the chamber hatch 
controls were defective on the in- 
side. Three hours later, when Miss 
Appleby decided to investigate the 
pounding noises, Quent was pur- 
ple from breathing C02 and she 
had to help him out. 

“Wha’s girl doing on this thing 
anyway?" he gasped. 

“Oh, a lot of us log officers take 
en-aitch tours," she dimpled. “It’s 
so restful." 

Quent shuddered and clamped 

17

his big jaw. 

About Appleby herself he 
learned that she spent all her time 
in her cubicles fixing up her trous- 
seau and her hoard of stuff for her 
future home. The amount of loot 
she had astonished him. But she 
seemed to have been equally ef- 
fective in loading up the Rosen- 
krantz' T.E.— the ship bulged 
with stores. She also emerged on 
the dot with excellent meals, 
which seemed to be Captain Im- 
ray’s chief interest in life. 

During the hop to Turlavon 
Quent made two more efforts to 
get into Morgan’s domain and was 
rebuffed. He settled down to 
learning the ship bolt by bolt, 
manual in hand. 

Turlavon passed without inci- 
dent. At Ed they had to wait for 
the planet station crew to finish 
harvesting. For three whole watch- 
es Quent struggled with unstable 
orbits, until he learned that Ed 
had enormous masscons and that 
someone had disassembled the 
ship’s grav-mass analyzer. He 
bore it all stoically but his jaw was 
corded with knots which seemed 
to have been there before. He 
had, after all, been an admiral’s 
son for a long time. 

A t midbase they lay into the 
main cargo umbilical to off- 
load a flywheel for the station gy- 
ros. The delay at Ed had thrown 
them out of synch with Base time 



and the station dark-period caught 
them early. Quent used the chance 
to check over the ship’s exterior 
valve seals. He had worked back 
to the main lock when his hand 
light picked up a small gray crea- 
ture hitting past the aft fins. It 
was about a meter tall and roughly 
humanoid. 

Quent called out. The figure 
accelerated and vanished among 
the dock belts. 

Quent frowned after it and 
went into the wardroom. Captain 
Imray was grunting over his green- 
book tabs. The others were on the 
bridge, listening to the station 
newscast. 

“Morgan,” said Quent. “Would 
he be about so high — and gray?” 
Imray leaned back and rubbed 
his prune nose. 

“That's him. He go now listen 
is them gyros all right. Like a 
mother for gyros is Morgan.” 

“He must have left by the en- 
gineroom crash hatch.” Quent 
pointed to the panel. “Why isn’t 
the telltale light on?” 

“The first officer’s appetite for 
the minutest details of our hum- 
ble craft is truly admirable,” 
yawned Sylla, lounging in. “If it 
were not so tedious.” 

“Mr. Sylla, if that hatch lock — ” 
“Sure, sure,” said Imray. “But 
Morgan never leave nothing 
open. Not Morgan. He like to 
come, go, private, vernt?*' 

“Do you mean that you’ve al- 



18 



IF 




lowed Morgan to kill the telltale 
circuits. Captain?” 

“The mammalian insecurity 
syndrome,” remarked Svensk, un- 
folding himself out of the shaft. 
He was playing with a small wire 
toroid which changed shape dis- 
turbingly. “The leaky-womb 
phobia,” he creaked. 

“Captain Imray,” said Quent, 
“by regulation it’s my responsibil- 
ity to oversee the engineroom. 
With your permission, this would 
seem to be the time for me to take 
a look.” 

Imray squinted at him. 

“Morgan very sensitive being, 
son, very sensitive.” He wiggled 
his big black-nailed hands to show 
Morgan’s sensitivity. Quent nod- 
ded and started aft. 

“Nothing touch, son,” Imray' 
called after him. “Morgan — ” 

The engineroom personnel 
hatch was still dogged. Quent 
went to the hull and unbolted a 
pod cradle, revealing a duct panel 
designed to service the life-sup- 
port conduit to Engines. He un- 
screwed the panel and tugged. It 
did not move. He displaced an- 
other cradle and found a magnetic 
contraption with no discoverable 
leads. He summoned Svensk, who 
arrived unliurriedly and gave it a 
brief inspection. 

“Can you open this?” 

“Yes,” said Svensk, and started 
back through the hold. 

“Mr. Svensk, come back, I 



want you to open this lock.” 

“The semantic confusions you 
homotherms get into are beyond 
belief,” croaked Svensk. “Are you 
not aware that Morgan desires 
this to remain closed?” 

“As first officer of this ship I am 
ordering you to open it.” 

“When I said I could open it — I 
meant with the proper tools.” 
“What are the prcper tools?” 
“Linear force must be applied 
in the presence of a certain set of 
alternating pressures in a gaseous 
medium.” 

He arched his long neck. Quent 
scowled at him. 

“Pressures? Mr. Svensk, are you 
deliberately — ” Quent suddenly 
stabbed his wrench at the saurian. 
“It’s a sonic lock, isn’t it? Set for 
. Mr. Pomeroy, bring that re- 
corder in the wardroom locker 
back here. I want you to imitate 
Morgan’s voice.” 

Reluctantly Pomeroy tooted 
while Quent tugged. The panel 
slid open. Quent found himself 
looking into a pitch-dark tangle 
instead of the shining banks and 
alleyways of a normal engine- 
room. 

“What in the name of space—” 
Quent reached into the fila- 
ments. 

“Sir, I wouldn’t do that,” 
warned Pomeroy. 

“Fascinating!” Svensk’s skull- 
head came over Quent’s shoulder. 
“What is that mess?” 



HAPPINESS IS A WARAASPACESHIP 



19 




“I fancy it is part of the sensor 
system by which Morgan main- 
tains contact with the stress struc- 
ture of his mechanisms. I had no 
idea he had achieved anything so 
extensive.” 

“Just close it up, please, sir,” 
Pomeroy begged. 

Quent stared into the web. 

“I’m going in,” he gritted. 

From behind them came a 
piercing wail. Quent spun and a 
gray wraith flew at his face, spit- 
ting sparks. He reeled back, his 
arms over his eyes. The hatch 
clashed shut. 

The lights went out. The hold 
voder broke into a skirling, howl- 
ing din. Quent heard Svensk 
pounding away and stumbled af- 
ter the sound. The wardroom vod- 
er began to roar. Quent found his 
hand light and rushed to the 
bridge. The deck was a bedlam of 
noise and every console was flash- 
ing. Svensk and Sylla were yank- 
ing out computer cables. Quent 
slammed down the circuit break- 
ers. There was no effect. The 
hideous din yammered on. 

“Nothing to do but get out till 
he calms down,” Pomeroy yelled 
in Quent’s ear. “Thank the Lord 
we aren’t in space.” 

T he others had left. As Quent 
went out Miss Appleby flew 
past in a whirl of tyrquoise silk. 

“You idiot,” she raged. “Look 
at what you’ve done.” 



Imray stood glowering on the 
deck. Svensk towered at full 
height, his eyes veiled in mem- 
branes. Sylla paced with ears laid 
back and there was a decided pun- 
gency in the air. 

Quent slammed the lock but the 
uproar reverberating through the 
Rosenkrantz was clearly audible. 

“He’s got an override on those 
circuits,” Quent fumed. “I’m 
going in there and cut off his air.” 
“Asinine,” grated Svensk. “We 
are in air.” 

“His water, then.” 

“To do so would render the 
refrigerant exchange inoperative.” 
“There must be something — 
what does he eat?” 

“Special concentrates,” snapped 
Miss Appleby. “I stocked him 
with a year’s supply at Central.” 
Quent kicked a freight belt. 

“In other words, Morgan runs 
this ship.” 

Imray shrugged angrily. 

“He run it — we run it — we go,” 
he growled. 

“When Space Force Monitor 
hears about this it’ll be Morgan 
who goes,” Quent told them 
darkly. 

Sylla spat. 

“The first officer has forgotten 
the Kipsuga Chomo. Or perhaps 
he recalls the four-ten which in- 
convenienced him?” 

“What?” Quent turned on the 
lutroid. “I have forgotten nothing, 
Mr. Sylla. What has the Kip to do 



20 



IF 




with Morgan?” 

Imray shook his jowls. 

“No, Syll,no!” 

Svensk coughed. 

“Look, sir,” said Pomeroy. 
“Morgan’s fixing to make a night 
of it. He don’t quit. How’s for 
you and me to go by the office 
and see about a place to sleep?” 
Miss Appleby sniffed. 

“That would be useful.” 

The din continued unabated. 
Quent went off with Pomeroy to 
the Midbase station offices, where 
they found one billet for a female 
only. Midbase was bulging with 
colonists awaiting transfer on 
Route Leo. In the end the male 
complement of the Rosenkrantz 
settled down to doze uncomfort- 
ably on a textile shipment and to 
endure the jibes of the cargomen 
when the lights came on. 

Horrible sounds came from the 
Rosenkrantz all morning. After 
noon mess Morgan appeared to 
tire. The officers went warily back 
on board. 

“Have to give him time to cool 
down,” said Pomeroy. As if on 
cue the voders erupted briefly. A 
few minutes later they did it 
again. The others went to their 
hammocks, leaving Quent in the 
wardroom to brood. 

He was still there when Miss 
Appleby came in. 

“I’m afraid I was rude to you. 
Lieutenant Quent.” 

He looked up dully. She seemed 



to be all aglow. 

“Actually what you did was 
ever so lucky for me.” 

She smiled. She set down her 
parcel and served herself tea and 
a cookie. Instead of taking them 
to her quarters she came back and 
sat down at the table with an ex- 
cited wiggle. 

Quent’s eyes opened. He sat up. 

“That Mrs. Lee,” she confided 
happily. “You know, the colo- 
nist? She’s got twenty meters of 
Gregarin passamenterie. It took 
me all day to talk her into swap- 
ping me one meter for a petite 
suit liner and a case of bottlehots. 
I’d never have got it if we hadn’t 
been held up, thanks to you.” 

She glowed at him over the tea. 

“Well, I~” 

“It’ll make the vest of all time 
for Bob,” she sighed. “Bob loves 
vests — off duty, of course.” 

Quent put his head back on his 
fists. He had been raised with two 
older sisters. 

“That’s — great.” 

“You’re depressed,” she ob- 
served. 

Quent heaved a sigh and shook 
his head. Against his better judg- 
ment he found himself looking in- 
to her large green eyes. 

“Miss Appleby,” he blurted. 
“When I came on this ship I was 
completely unprejudiced against 
nonhumans. Completely. I wel- 
comed the chance to show my fa- 
ther that other beings were just as

fit to serve in space as — ” His 
voice faded. “Now I just don’t 
know. This mess — that insuffer- 
able Morgan — ” 

“Yours is a strange reaction. 
Lieutenant. We girls always say 
it’s much safer on a ship with one 
of Morgan’s people. They’ll do 
anything for the ship. Like the 
Kip, you know.’’ 

“What do you know about the 
KipsugaT' 

“Why, just that their engineer 
saved them. He got them to Cen- 
tral. Ikka somebody. Pom says he 
died.” 

Quent frowned. 

“Funny they didn’t tell me 
about him.” 

“Probably your father is the 
reason they keep things from you 
— don’t you think. Lieutenant?” 
She stood up, hugging her parcel. 
“They’re fine people,” she told 
him earnestly. “You just have to 
understand their ways. That’s 
what Bob says. He says a lot of 
Space Force officers are preju- 
diced without knowing it.” 

Quent looked up at her. She 
radiated Galactic amity. 

“Could be,” he said slowly. 
“Miss Appleby, maybe 1 haven’t 

“Try a little harder,” she en- 
couraged him. “That Mrs. Lee 
said a newsman was asking about 
you.” 

“It is time to eat.” 

The harsh croak cut her off. 



Svensk unfolded himself from the 
ladder. 

“Right away.” 

Appleby vanished. Svensk 
turned a suspicious eye on Quent. 

“Serpent,” jeered Sylla, bounc- 
ing down, “You reptiles did not 
understand that time existed until 
we provided you with thermal 
vests. At home we have still the 
taboo against eating lizards be- 
cause of their unfortunate tenden- 
cy to putrefy while torpid.” 

“Activity fails to correlate with 
intelligence,” Svensk clacked 
haughtily. 

“On the other hand,” Sylla 
licked his vibrissae. “Our pri- 
mates are regarded as quite palat- 
able. Braised, naturally, with just 
a rien of celery. Amusing, is it 
not. First Officer Quent?” 

Quent exhaled carefully. 

“If you feel so, Mr. Sylla.” He 
stretched his mouth sideways in a 
lifelike smile. “Excuse me, I be- 
lieve I’ll lie down.” 

The silence behind him lasted 
so long he almost wondered about 
it.

laboriously servicing beacons

which attracted dust, thus build- 
ing up electrostatic imbalances 
that distorted the beacon’s spec- 
trum and eventually its orbit. 
They had to be periodically 
cleaned and neutralized. The job 
required long hours and close co- 
operation among crewmen. By 
the fourth and last beacon 
Quent’s jaw had developed a per- 
manent ache. 

“Have you not yet finished. 
First Officer?” 

Quent was clinging awkwardly 
to the far end of the slippery kine- 
tic bleeder. Above him Sylla wrig- 
gled through the beacon grids 
with the agility of his otter for- 
bears, warping his vacuum line 
expertly as he went. 

“It is clear that the Academy 
does not contemplate its graduates 
shall endure the indignity of la- 
bor,” Sylla jibed. 

“I admit Fm inexperienced in 
this and not as fast as you are,” 
Quent said mildly. “Mr. Svensk. 
Where are you casting that sweep 
line?” 

“As per your request, down,” 
said Svensk from the far side. 
“Although it seems senseless.” 

“I meant down here — toward 
me,” Quent took a deep breath. 
“Not toward the center of gravity 
of the beacon-ship system. A 
loose way of speaking. I’m 
afraid.” 

“Lieutenant Quent, sir,” said 
Pomeroy’s voice from the ship. 



“If you wouldn’t mind sir, could 
you turn your volume down a bit? 
There seems to be some sort of 
grinding sound in your speaker 
and the Greenhill signal is awful 
weak, sir.” 

Greenhill, a colony ship out of 
Midbase, was running a check on 
the beacon calibrations as it went 
by. 

Quent swore and snapped off 
his helmet speaker. A moment 
later he felt a jerk on his lines and 
found himself revolving in space 
two meters from the end of the 
bleeder. His line had no tension. 
When he stopped his tumble he 
saw that Svensk had fouled him 
with the sweep and was departing 
over the limb of the beacon. Sylla 
was nowhere in sight. 

“Do you want your life to de- 
pend on an octopus?” Quent mut- 
tered under his breath. He 
reached for the speaker switch, 
then paused. His orbit was decay- 
ing. He straightened out and be- 
gan to breathe measuredly. 

The others had gone inboard 
and unsuited when Quent finally 
finished clearing the bleeder shaft. 
In the wardroom he stumbled into 
Miss Appleby taking a server of 
food to Imray’s cubicle. 

“I want you to know I’m try- 
ing,” he told her wearily. 

“That’s the spirit. Lieutenant.” 

She would make a super admi- 
ral’s wife, Quent realized. 

The Greenhill confirmed the

beacon calibrations and the Ro- 
senkrantz headed out to the 
Chung Complex. When she came 
out of drive her screens lit up in 
glory. The Chung was a cluster of 
colored suns, warm and inviting 
after the bleakness of Route Leo. 

“Don’t you believe it, sir.” 
Pomeroy broke the thread of his 
crochet work against his stained 
frontals. “I dread this place, I 
do.” His eyes rolled as he reached 
for his bulb. “All en-aitches here. 
Under water, too, most of ’em, 
the slimy things. Even Mr. Sylla 
hates them.” 

Despite Pomeroy’s forebodings 
the first calls passed off with only 
routine problems of mail and mes- 
sage exchange. The little man 
continued to follow Quent about, 
mumbling gloomity. He was also 
dosing himself with increasing 
quantities of Leo Lightning when- 
ever he could sneak off the bridge. 

“Let Pomeroy tell you, sir,” he 
grumbled in the night watches, 
“They’re devils down there. We 
shouldn’t have any dealings with 
things like them. Pomeroy knows. 
Pomeroy’s seen sights no Humans 
had ought to bear. Worms. 
Worms is the least of it.” His 
goatee bobbed over his scrawny 
adam’s apple. “Worms and 
worse.” 

The Chung orbits continued 
without troubles other than those 
provided by Svensk and Sylla — 
and even these two appeared to be 



letting up. Quent’s only view of 
the “worms and worse” was on 
the ship’s screens. Most of the 
alien commo officers were aquat- 
ic. A few did appear wormlike and 
two had tentacles. There was one 
truly repellent squid affair w^ith 
unidentifiable organs floating 
around its eye stalks. There was 
also a rather genial dolphinoid to 
whom Pomeroy was vitriolic. 
They were the ones who had re- 
quired transport for the octopi. 

“I’m a broadminded man, sir,” 
Pomeroy told Quent that night. 
“Tolerant, Pomeroy is. I put up 
with ’em.” He hiccuped. “No 
choice. Pomeroy’s sunk low. I 
don’t deny it. But them things 
down there — ” He shuddered and 
hitched closer confidentially. 
“They think they’re as good as 
humans, sir. Just as good as you, 
or better. What’ll happen when 
them things decides they wants to 
come in the Force, sir? Expect a 
human to take orders from a 
worm?” His bloodshot eyes bored 
anxiously into Quent’s. 

“Mr. Pomeroy. In case you are 
under the impression that I share 
my father’s views on nonhumans 
in the Space Force, you are mis- 
taken.” 

“You’re a tolerant man, sir. 
But a person can’t help wonder- 
ing—” 

“Kindly wonder to yourself in 
future, Mr. Pomeroy,” Quent 
said coldly. “For your informa-

IF 




tion, I am fully in favor of the 
integration program. If a being is 
a competent spacer, I don’t see 
that his personal appearance en- 
ters.” 

Pomeroy closed his mouth and 
turned back to his board in of- 
fended silence. Presently he paid 
a prolonged visit to the wardroom 
and returned, wiping his mouth.' 
For several watches he spoke only 
when Quent addressed him. 

A t the last Chung stop they 
picked up a short-range 
freight shuttle whose jockey 
needed a lift to Farbase. The 
jockey was a smaller version of 
Svensk. They got his shuttle 
stowed without mishap and the 
Rosenkrantz went into drive for 
the long run out to Farbase. 
Quent’s eyebrows began to un- 
knot. 

The run was made in compara- 
tive peace, for Quent. Svensk and 
the freighter pilot bankrupted 
each other at some exotic topolog- 
ical game, while Sylla occupied 
himself with trying to key a poet- 
ry-scanning function into the com- 
puter. Imray grew increasingly 
taciturn and spent long hours in 
his cubicle. Sometimes Quent 
would hear him in rumbling argu- 
ment with one of the others. 
Quent devoted himself to a dis- 
creet inspection of the ship’s wir- 
ing and managed not to upset 
Morgan. Things seemed to be set- 



tling down. 

This impression strengthened 
when they got to Farbase. They 
exchanged the mail and off-loaded 
the freight shuttle with dispatch. 
Pomeroy actually changed his 
shirt. He and the others set off to 
call on another peebee, the Jasper 
Banks, which was there en route 
to a long distance job. Miss Ap- 
pleby went after the depot officer 
who had promised her a set of 
Chung pearl glasses for herself 
and a case of fish-eggs for the 
mess. The small, bleak station of- 
fered Quent no diversion. He de- 
cided to go out and check over 
the exterior antennae. 

He was suiting up when he 
heard the others coming back on 
board. He climbed to the bridge 
to find them preparing to take off. 

“Call Appleby,” Imray grunted 
curtly. “We go now.” 

The next leg was to the sector 
rim colonies of Goldmine, Tunney 
and Sopwith. They ship lifted off 
with scarcely another word ex- 
changed by its officers. And as 
soon as they were in drive Imray 
left the bridge. 

The short run to Goldmine was 
made in thickening silence. Imray 
stayed in his cubicle. The others 
seemed on edge. Only Pomeroy 
had anything to say — he kept pes- 
tering Appleby for reports on Im- 
ray’s health. 

“He says his heart bothers him 
but he won’t let me use the medi-

cal analyzer,” she informed them. 
“His appetite’s good, though.” 

“He’s due to retire soon, sir.” 
Pomeroy shook his head. 

Imray did not appear on the 
bridge at Goldmine. When they 
were on course for Tunney he 
called Quent to his cabin. 

“Is no good,” he said hoarsely 
as soon as Quent’s head came 
through the sphincter. The ursi- 
noid’s muzzle looked haggard and 
his fur was staring. 

“You take over, son.” He ges- 
tured feebly, dislodging an empty 
server. 

“Sir, I think you should let 
Miss Appleby bring the medikit.” 

Imray groaned. 

“Medicals can nothing do for 
old age. Little pills I try. No 
good.” 

“We’ll turn back to Farbase 
hospital.” 

“What they do? Torture me 
only. I know. With my people — 
goes quick. You captain. I tell 
Morgan mind you.” 

“You’re ordering me to take 
over as acting captain, sir?” 

Imray nodded, his little eyes 
roving feverishly. 

“But—” 

“No but. You captain.” 

Imray’s eyes closed and his 
breathing became noisy. 

Quent studied him, scowling. 

“Yes, sir,” he said slowly. “I’ll 
have Pomeroy patch you into the 
record log.” 



One of Imray’s eyes glinted 
briefly and closed again. 

Quent withdrew into the shaft 
of the Rosenkrantz. His first com- 
mand. All the knots which had 
been smoothing from his face 
came back, tighter than before. 

To his surprise the others ac- 
cepted the situation without com- 
ment, beyond Sylla’s sarcastic use 
of his new title. Morgan, too, 
proved as good as Imray’s word. 
He continued silent but during the 
maneuvers at Tunney the energies 
were flawless. Quent’s frown deep- 
ened. 

He took to roaming the ship at 
odd hours, sleeping little and 
poorly. They were now at the 
farthest leg of their patrol, run- 
ning along the sector rim to Sop- 
with. On their starboard the Gal- 
axy was unpatrolled and largely 
unknown. Quent spent hours at 
the scanners. He had seen wild 
space before from the bridge of 
the mighty and virtually invulner- 
able Adastra. From a peebee with 
four srhall rockets and only mete- 
or shielding it looked decidedly 
wilder. Quent dreamed of nucle- 
onic storms and got up to check 
over the sensors again. Crawling 
back into the cocoon, he heard: 

Toujours fentends la mer 
qui fait du bruit, 

Triste comme Foiseau 
seule . 



26 



IF 




Q UENT groaned and pulled 
the cocoon flaps over his 
ears to shut out the mechanical 
drone from the bridge. Sylla was 
making the computer translate 
poetry into his native Ter-French. 
Presently the droning was re- 
placed by incomprehensible wran- 
gling. 

Quent sighed and jackknifed out 
of his cocoon. It was nearly his 
shift and they would be coming 
into Sopwith soon. 

In the shaft he found Pomeroy 
backing out of Imray’s cubicle, 
bulb in hand. 

“How is he, Mr. Pomeroy?” 

The little man wagged his head, 
bleary eyed, but said nothing. 

In the wardroom Miss Appleby 
was setting out fresh smoked ham 
she had wangled at Tunney. 

“Just coffee, thank you,” Quent 
told her. 

She smiled sympathetically at 
the standing furrow in his brow 
and vanished back to her store- 
rooms. 

Quent took his coffee up to the 
bridge, relieving Svensk and Syl- 
la, and settled wearily to hear a 
data tape. Pomeroy straggled into 
his cubby and began to doze. In 
the wardroom the other two con- 
tinued to argue fitfully. 

Suddenly Pomeroy sat up. 
“Sopwith, sir. Seems to be a 
bit of trouble.” 

“What type of trouble, Mr. 
Pomeroy?” 



“Too early to tell yet, sir. Most- 
ly noise.” 

Sopwith was a nonhuman affili- 
ated planet whose native name 
was Szolphuildhe. The native race 
was described as small, timid, 
pinkish in color, bipedal and 
probably bisexual, with a fibers- 
and-ceramics technology. It was 
human-habitable but no humans 
lived there. 

“Sounds like they been at- 
tacked by a band of marauding 
monsters,” Pomeroy reported pre- 
sently. “Says they came in a sky- 
boat — wait a minute, sir.” He 
squinted, listening. “About them 
monsters, sir. Appears like they’re 
humans.” 

“Humans?” 

“That’s how the kinds describe 
’em, sir. Like us.” 

“What are they doing to the 
Sopwithians?” 

“Seems they’re eating ’em, sir.” 
“Eating them, Mr. Pomeroy?” 
Pomeroy nodded. Quent leaned 
over the shaft and called Svensk. 
The big saurian head appeared. 

Quent asked, “What human 
spacers could have landed here 
and attacked the natives or — ah — 
exploited them as food?” 

Svensk’s raised his eye mem- 
branes reflectively. 

“Possibly you refer to Drakes?” 
“What are Drakes?” 

“The Drakes, as they call them- 
selves, are a band of humans, 
strength unknown, base unknown.

possessing not less than five “One of our little sector prob-

please. Mr. Svensk, let’s pick up 
the location of that vessel as soon 
as possible. Mr. Pomeroy, ask 
them where that sky-boat is, how 
big it is, how many attackers and 
what weapons.” 



The Sopwith commo officer be- 
lieved that the ship had come 
down somewhere northeast of the 
port city. It was bigger and 
brighter than the sun, carrying at 
least five hands of monsters. They 
spouted burning flames which 
made no noise. 

“That’s thirty of ’em,” said 
Pomeroy. “As to their weapons. 
Drakes would have lasers, flame- 
throwers, grenades and maybe a 
rocket-launcher or two, ground- 
side. Them kinks don’t know 
ships or weapons, sir. Flinging 
stones is about it, with them.” 

They still had not located the 
alien ship when the Sopwith city 
area went into night.. The Sop- 
with commo officer on the ground 
was growing balky. 

“He says the monsters are com- 
ing in again,” Pomeroy reported. 
“Listen.” 

The voder gabbled wildly, gave 
out a string of shrieks and cut off. 

“That’s it, sir. He’s taken off. 
Well, there’ll be no business here. 
We’d better log up the report and 
get on.” 



M r. svensk, what’s that 
field like?” asked Quent 
thoughtfully. 

The lizard was absorbed in his 
sensor adjustments. 

“Mr. Svensk. Is that field us- 
able?” 

Svensk reared up. 

“Very primitive.” 

“Navigator,” Quent said icily. 



HAPPINESS IS A WARAASPACESHIP 




“Landing trajectory to field, 
please.” 

Three pairs of eyes rounded on 
him. 

“Landing?” Sylla licked his 
chops. “The acting captain is per- 
haps unaware that patrol boats do 
not — ” 

“I’ve inspected our system, Mr. 
Sylla. It’s fully operational. In 
case you’re concerned, my train- 
ing has included the landing of 
comparable craft.” 

“But sir,” protested Pomeroy, 
“What about Morgan? He don’t 
like going planetside, sir.” 

Quent glanced at the voders 
and cleared his throat. 

“Mr. Morgan, there is an emer- 
gency on this planet and we must 
land. I count on your cooperation. 
Mr. Sylla, is that course ready?” 

“Set,” snapped Sylla through 
his teeth. 

Quent engaged the auxiliaries 
and started to code in the auto- 
pilot. As he touched it the famil- 
iar din cut loose from the voder. 

“Mr. Morgan.” Quent rapped 
the speaker. “Stop that racket. 
We must land, do you under- 
stand? I’m taking us down!” 

To the din was added a crack- 
ling sputter and the lights jumped. 
Svensk dived for his computer 
leads. 

“Stop that, Morgan. Stop it. 
I’m going to land or I’ll crash the 
ship. Hear that — you’ll crash us.” 

“In the name of the Path,” Im- 



ray came from the shaft. “What?” 

“It’s our duty to land, sir,” 
Quent said. “Emergency on the 
planet.” 

Imray burst onto the bridge, 
paws over his ears. He stared at 
Quent. 

“I’m committing us.” 

Quent slammed the manual 
override. 

Imray grabbed up his speaker. 

“Morgan — Morgan, boy, it’s 
me.” Imray’s voice sank to a huge 
croon. “Be good boy, Morgan — 
down we must go. I swear you, 
for little minute only — ship it will 
not hurt. Morgan! You hear, 
Morgan? Morgan boy, listen Im- 
ray — ten meters superconductors 
I get you. Beautiful.” 

The uproar dwindled to a mewl- 
ing in Imray’s speaker. 

“You let us go down nice, Mor- 
gan, vernt?” 

Silence. Imray clapped his fist 
to his chest and his head slumped. 

“Is too much, son,” he wheezed 
and retreated down the shaft. 

“Counting to autopilot,” said 
Sylla. Quent coded feverishly as 
deceleration grabbed them. On the 
screens the arid, undistinguished 
planet whirled closer. 

The autopilot took hold uncere- 
moniously and spiraled them in, 
shaken but right side up. When 
the roil cleared they looked across 
a moonlit field to a cluster of sheds 
around the antennae rig. There 
were no lights.

“They’ve all sloped off, sir,” 
said Pomeroy. “Nothing we can do 
here till morning.” 

“Mr. Pomeroy, you speak the 
native language,” said Quent. “I 
will meet you at the cargo lock. 
Have the sled ready.” 

“But sir — ” 

“Mr. Svensk, am I correct that 
we need no special masks or suit- 
ing on this planet?” 

Svensk gave a sighing exhala- 
tion. 

“No need,” he croaked. 

They followed Quent in si- 
lence while he broke out two field 
kits and two ballistic hand lasers. 
At the cargo lock he opened both 
ports and ordered Pomeroy into 
the sled. 

“Lieutenant Sylla, you will take 
over the ship. One of you will be 
on the bridge at all times. If we’re 
not back by sunrise, make what 
investigation you can without en- 
dangering the ship. If you can’t 
help us without hazard to the ship, 
lift off at once and signal the facts 
to Farbase. Understood?” 

Sylla’s eyes were popping. 
“Understood, Acting Captain!” 
He sketched a salute, 

Svensk watched in silence, his 
bony head folded to his shoulders 
in the gravity. 

Quent launched the sled out in- 
to the moonlight. The country be- 
low was flat scrubland gashed by 
a few dark arroyos, now dry. The 
city was a huddle of hive-like 



buildings with a central plaza. 
Quent hovered by a torch-lit struc- 
ture, a shrine. Nothing moved. 

“No damage visible so far. We’ll 
go down and talk to the chief.” 

“Be careful, sir.” Pomeroy 
warned uneasily. 

In the plaza they pounded and 
shouted at the door of the largest 
hive-house, k was finally opened 
by a small squat Sopwithian en- 
tirely draped in a softly gleaming 
robe. 

“Tell him we’re friends. Where’s 
the chief?” 

The doorkeeper scuttled off on 
his knuckles, robes jingling. The 
inside of the adobe hive was a 
labyrinth of basket-work passages, 
every surface bossed with bits of 
metal and colored tassels. The na- 
tive returned, beckoning, and they 
scrambled up a wicker corridor to 
a chamber where an even broader 
Sopwithian in a shinier robe sat 
impassive in a lanterned alcove. 
The ceiling was so low even Pom- 
eroy had to squat. 

He gurgled at the chief, who re- 
plied briefly, now and then flap- 
ping his long robed forelimbs with 
a sharp jangle. The raiders, Pom- 
eroy reported, had burned several 
farms northeast of town and car- 
ried off the families. Herdsmen 
had spied them roasting and eat- 
ing the captives beside their ship. 

“All right,” said Quent. He 
ducked his head to the chief and 
they scrambled out to their sled. 



HAPPINESS IS A WARAASPACESHIP

H e took off in a howling 
rush northeast. Beyond the 
town the pasture scrub stretched 
barren to a line of mesa, all bright- 
ly lit by the big moon. Here and 
there were small beehive farms set 
in irrigated gardens. 

“Where are those burned 
farms?” Quent peered. “Where’s 
that ship?” 

“Take care, sir,” Pomeroy 
pleaded. “Them Drakes’ll come on 
us like devils — ” 

Quent began to fly a low search 
pattern. As he circled a farm 
heads popped out. 

“They’re scared to death, sir. 
Think we’re Drakes. Pitiful.” 
“Frightened.” Quent frowned 
around the moonlit horizon. “Ah, 
what’s that?” 

Pomeroy writhed nervously. 
“That’s a burnt one, all right. No 
need to look farther.” 

Quent circled the blackened 
shell. Suddenly he skidded the sled 
into the farmyard and jumped out, 
kicking ashes. In a moment he was 
back and flung the sled airborne. 
He seized the speaker. 

“Quent to Rosenkrantz. I’ve 
found that ship.” 

The speaker crackled. Quent 
fended off Pomeroy’s arm, deftly 
appropriating the little man’s 
laser. 

“Do you read, Rosenkrantz?*^ 
“The ship is where. Acting 
Captain?” asked Sylla’s voice. 
“About fifty kiloms northeast of 



field, in a canyon,” Quent told 
. him. “There is also a raiding party 
in sight, headed this way. They are 
armed. They have sighted me. 
Now hear this: You will signal Far- 
base at once and prepare to lift 
ship. I’m going after these raiders. 
Repeat, signal Farbase and secure 
ship. I am now being fired on. 
Out.” 

Knocking Pomeroy into the cor- 
ner, Quent yanked out the speaker 
leads and slammed the sled at top 
speed back toward the field. 

“Sir — Lieutenant Quent, sir, 
don’t — ” 

Quent ignored him. Presently 
he cut power and glided around 
the end of the field at bush level. 
They whispered out to the ship, 
dodged behind a landleg and came 
upon Svensk and Sylla in the open 
port. 

Quent vaulted out, weapon in 
hand. 

“Have you signaled as ordered, 
Mr. Sylla?” 

The lutroid shrugged. 

“But what was one to report. 
Acting Captain?” 

“Precisely,” snapped Quent 
and started for the bridge with 
both lasers in his belt. They fol- 
lowed. 

Imray hulked in the command 
chair. He eyed Quent in silence, 
arms folded over his massive chest. 

“Feeling better, sir?” Quent 
snarled. He wheeled and thrust his 
jaw into Sylla’s muzzle. “I’ll tell

you why you failed to signal Far> 
base. And why you two were hang- 
ing out in the open lock when I or- 
dered you to secure ship. Because 
you know damn well there are no 
raiders here.” 

He had his back against the 
screens now and a laser drawn. 

“No ship! No Drakes. It’s all one 
big farce and all of you are in it. 
You, you clown Pomeroy — you. 
Captain Imray! What are you try- 
ing to hide? Smuggling? Extortion? 
Or do I have to pound it out of 
you?” 

He heard a rustle, saw Svensk’s 
hand at his vest controls. 

“No, no, Svenka,” Imray 
growled. “Battles we don’t need.” 
He shook his head heavily. I told 
you — Drake business no good.” 

“Agh, your Drakes, the whole 
thing stank from the start. Let me 
tell you something, gentlemen.” 
Ouent shook the laser at Sylla, 
“You jeer about my training but 
there’s a thing you don’t know 
about Academy life. In the years 
I’ve been a cadet I’ve been hazed 
and hoaxed and put on by experts. 
Experts.” His voice rose. “Caristo, 
what I’ve put up with. And you, 
gentlemen, are a clobbing bunch of 
amateurs. Tri-di gigs,” 

He snorted, glaring contemptu- 
ously at them. No one spoke. 

“You didn’t think I caught on 
when you handed me the ship? 
Cooking up some way to gash my 
record. Here in Sopwith — I was 



supposed to pass it up, wasn’t I? 
Oh, yes. And you — ” He stabbed 
the laser at Pomeroy — “You were 
going to bugger the log so you 
could show I refused to aid aliens 
against humans, right? Then bring 
charges? But why? I’ll be rotated 
out soon enough — why did you 
have to ruin me, too?” He scowled. 
“My father. Blackmail. You’ve 
got something going. I’m going to 
take this ship apart right here on 
the ground. It’s on record that 
you’re unfit for duty. Captain. 
You didn’t think of that when you 
got so clobbing elaborate!” 

They gaped at him. Sylla’s pu- 
pils swelled, contracted. 

“I tell you, smart boy,” Imray 
grunted. He scratched his chest. 
“Son, you mistake — ” 

A shrill mew from Engines split 
the air. ‘Imray jerked around. He 
yanked at his webs. 

“I got you, boy.” 

“Hold it,” shouted Quent. 
“Don’t try—” 

S YLLA and Pomeroy dived for 
their consoles. Svensk was van- 
ishing down the shaft. 

“I said hold it.” Quent grabbed 
the override lever. “You’re staying 
right here.” 

“Sit, son, sit,” Imray rumbled. 
“Is danger, I swear by the Path. If 
don’t go up, lose ship.” 

“That’s straight, sir. We’ll be 
killed if you don’t let us up.”

crest fur ridged. The cargo lock 
clanged. 

“If this is another — ’’ Quent 
rasped. 

He released the lever and began 
to web up one-handedly, laser 
ready. 

Imray's hand smacked down 
and several invisible mountains 
fell on them as the Rosenkrantz 
careened off-planet to full drive. 

“Back side moon, Syll,” Imray 
wheezed. 

“All right. What goes?” 

“Drakes,” said Pomeroy. 

“You trying to go on with this?” 

Svensk was scrambling out of 
the shaft, headed for his console. 
He brushed against Quent’s laser. 
On the screens the moon was bal- 
looning up. They rushed across the 
terminator into darkness. 

“Drakes is real, son,” Imray 
told him. “Catch ship on dirt — we 
finish. Is maybe judgment on us. 
Boys, they smell us?” 

“I rather think they may not.” 
Svensk’s clack seemed to have 
been replaced by a cultivated Gal 
Fed accent. “Morgan sensed them 
just below the horizon and our 
emissions should have decayed by 
the time they get around.” 

Frowning, Quent watched Imray 
braking to stability over the dark 
craters of the moon whose lighted 
side has guided his ground search. 

“They’re coming around,” said 
Pomeroy. “Listen.” 

A confused cawing filled the 



bridge. Quent made out the word 
kavrot in coarse Galactic. A kavrot 
was a repulsive small flying reptile 
that infested dirty freighters. 

“Talking about us,” Pomeroy 
grinned. His goatee no longer wag- 
gled. “Kavrots, that's us. Doesn’t 
sound like they know we’re here, 
though.” 

He cut the voder. 

“Braking emissions,” said 
Svensk. “It appears they’re going 
down.” 

Quent pushed up and moved in 
behind the lizard, laser in hand. 
Svensk did not look up. 

“If this is another gig — ” 

He studied the displays. No- 
body paid attention. 

'Captain?*’ Syria’s fist was up.

I MRAY grunted and the Rosen- 
krantz began to glide silently on 
her docking impellors down toward 
the sunlit peaks at the moon’s 
eastern horizon. Sylla’s paw beck- 
oned Imray left, pushed right, 
dipping, banking as the mountains 
rose around them. His fist chopped 
down, Imray cut power and they 
floated under a peak outlinecf in 
crystal fires. They were just shield- 
ed from the field on the planet 
below. 

“Last pass coming up,” said 
Svensk. “Splendid. They’ve blown 
up the field antennae. That elim- 
inates our trace. Sitting down.

now.” 

“From which one deduces?” 
asked Sylla. 

“From which one deduces that 
they either do not know we are 
here or do not care, or have some 
other plan. We could be going 
into a trap?” 

“First one best,” said Imray. 

“They’re going to send out a 
party.” 

Pomeroy patched in and they 
heard the harsh voices now aug- 
mented by clangings. 

Quent stowed the lasers by his 
console. 

“Are they human?” 

Imray nodded gloomily. 

“Is a judgment, boys. They 
going to mess up.” 

“Eating the natives?” 

“Maybe better so,” Imray 
growled. “No — we don’t know 
exact what they do. They come 
here once only, burn two farms, 
go quick. Why they come back?” 

“You will recall my hypothesis 
at the time,” said Svensk. 

^ Sylla made a frying sound. 

“Yes. Crude but effective.” 
Svensk nodded. “The adobe shells 
should make excellent hearths and 
the heat developed would be ade- 
quate to refine out most of the 
metals.” . 

Pomeroy caught Quent’s look. 

“You saw the metal in their 
houses? All woven in, even on 
their clothes. Every house is load- 
ed, accumulation of centuries. 



Haven’t a cat’s use for it — purely 
religious. They pick it up on ritual 
collecting trips. Spicules, nuggets, 
it’s all scattered around in grains 
in alluvial rubble. You couldn’t 
mine it. Point is, there’s tantalite, 
osmiridium, maybe some palladi- 
um. Big price around here. When 
we found those farms burned, 
Svensk noticed they’d been at the 
ashes. Metal was gone. He figured 
they’d come back for more, burn 
the town out. And the damnfool 
Sops , run in when they’re scared.” 
He grimaced, not comicafly. 

“Why wouldn’t they make the 
natives bring it to them?” 

“Never get it. Sops are diffi- 
cult. Much simpler this way. Also 
hairier, Drake style.” 

“If this is true, it’s our clear 
duty to stop it,” said Quent. 

“Son,” said Imray, “Space 
Force is long way away. We here, 
only. What they got down there, 
Svenka?” 

“Sector Ten was quite correct,” 
said Svensk. “Unmistakable. They 
have succeeded in repairing that 
A.E.V. The shield was on for a 
minute just now.” 

Quent whistled. 

“Do you mean they’ve got an 
Armed Escort Vessel? That shield 
will be a phased englobement — 
they can sense and fire right 
through it.” 

“Drake damn good spacer,” 
Imray told him. “Always watch. 
We try sneak in, we get fireball

in nose. We stuck, looks like.” 

""Je me demande'" said Sylla, 
‘‘How do they propose to con- 
flagrate the city?” 

”A good point,” Svensk 
stretched. “The farms, of course, 
were fired with portable flamers. 
This seems a slow method. Possi- 
bly irksome as well. I fancy they 
may intend to use the ship as a 
mobile torch.” 

“If they hover that low,” Quent 
said thoughtfully, “they could only 
use the top half of their shield. An 
A.E. shield forms in two hemi- 
spheres. Same for the sensor field, 
too. They can’t englobe fully much 
below a thousand meters.” 

“Ahe!” exclaimed Sylla. “One 
could thus attack them under the 
belly, non! But — we cannot get 
our ship from here to there unde- 
tected. And the sled, it functions 
only in the air . If only we pos- 
sessed a space-to-air attack pod!” 
“You do,” said Quent. 

They stared at him. 

“The aft rocket turret. Look at 
you manual.” 

“Manual,” said Imray blankly. 
“In a few early peebees, the aft 
rocket cell is demountable and 
converts to a module capable of 
limited in-atmosphere function,” 
Quent recited. “The empennage is 
sealed flush to the hull. You un- 
bolt a stabilizer fin and swivel it 
around for the delta. I checked it 
over — it’s there. Didn’t you ever 
notice the shielding and lock on 



that thing?” 

“Fantastic,” said Svensk. “Now 
you mention — but how is it pow- 
ered?” 

“You couple on an emergency 
booster and impellor unit from the 
ship’s drive after the thing is set 
up and the pilot is inside. Prefer- 
ably a spare, if you have one — 
you’ll recall that my inspections 
terminated at the engineroom 
bulkhead,” he said bitterly. 

“You sure manual say all that, 
son?” Imray demanded. “This 
thing work?” 

“Certainly,” Quent snapped. 
“How do I know if it works?” 

Sylla licked his chops. 

“Thus, one could employ the 
thrust while concealed by this 
moon, and descend without power, 
avoiding detection because of the 
small size, and brake after one is 
below their horizon. One then 
approaches silently at ground 
level, on impellors — and when 
the enemy elevates himself, 
boom.” He sprang to the shaft. 
“Let us view this marvel!” 

In the hold Quent showed them 
the old demount levers, long since 
obstructed by mail-pod racks. 

“One wonders how orthagonal a 
trajectory this thing would en- 
dure,” said Svensk. 

“T h e r m a 1 1 i u m,” Quent 
shrugged. “If the delta didn’t come 
off.” 

“Somebody going to get killed 
bad.” Imray peered suspiciously 



36 



IF 




into the turret. “For engine I must 
talk Morgan. Pfoo!” 

“You talked him into harassing 
me easily enough,” said Quent. 

“No, that natural,” grunted 
Imray, hauling over to the speaker. 

“Someday that spook will meet 
a Drake and find out who his en- 
emies are,” said Pomeroy’s voice 
from the bridge. “They have a 
party in the city now. Looting. 
Gives us some time.” 

""Allons, the suits,” called 
Sylla from the ladder. 

I N AN hour’s sweating hull- 
work they had uncoupled the 
turret and dogged it to the fin. The 
old sealant was vitrified but the 
assembly went in with surprising 
ease. 

“That stuff will burn off,” said 
Quent. “What a contraption!” 
“The aerodynamics of a rock,” 
Svensk murmured. “Pod-chutes, 
perhaps, could be attached to these 
holes? I suggest as many as possi- 
ble.” 

“The engine approaches!” Sylla 
popped out of the turret as the 
massive shape of Imray appeared 
around the Rosenkrantz’ stern, 
propelling a drive unit bundled 
in a working shield. 

“Two. gross nanocircuits must 
I get,” he grumbled as they all 
wrestled the inertia of the big 
unit. They brought it into line with 
the turret lock. Imray glanced in. 
“You check how it steers, Syll?” 



“That rather mystifying sec- 
ondary panel on the rocket con- 
sole,” said Svensk. “Perfectly ob- 
vious, once the power leads were 
exposed. I shall have no trouble.” 

His long figure contorted as he 
groped for the control of his ther- 
mal vest. Sylla slid between him 
and the turret. 

“This is no swamp for over- 
heated serpents. Desist — you will 
be worse than the ants. It is I who 
go, of course.” 

“So.” Imray turned on Quent, 
who was moving in on the other 
side. “You want go, too?” 

Quent grabbed the lock. 

“I’m the obvious choice.” 

“Good,” said Imray. “Look 
here.” 

He tapped Quent on the shoul- 
der with one oversized gauntlet 
and suddenly straightened his arm. 
Quent sailed backward into Sylla 
and Svensk. When the three sorted 
themselves out they saw that Im- 
ray had clambered into the turret, 
which he filled compactly. 

“Close up engines, boys,” he 
blared jovially into their helmets. 
“Watch tight, is hot. Syll, you set 
me good course, vernt?" 

The three lieutenants glumly 
coupled the drive unit, bolted and 
thermofoamed the extra chutes 
and piled back up to the bridge. 

“Foxed you, didn’t he?” Pom- 
eroy sobered. “They’re still tear- 
ing up the chief’s house. We may 
have them figured all wrong.” 



HAPPINESS IS A WARAASPACESHIP 



37 




The screens showed Imray’s 
vehicle lurching past on a climb- 
ing course above the dark moon- 
scape. 

“Svensk, explain to him the 
navigation.” Sylla crouched over 
his console. “He must modify to 
azimuth thirty heading two 
eighteen or he will burst into their 
faces at once. Now I devise the 
settings for his burndown.” 

“Sure, sure,” said Imray’s 
voice. They saw his rocket module 
yaw to a new course. “Svensk, 
what I do with pink button?” 

“Captain,” Svensk sighed, “if 
you will first observe the right- 
hand indicators — ” 

“At least the impellors work,” 
said Quent. 

Pomeroy fretted: “This is all 
guesswork.” 

Svensk was now relaying the 
burn configuration, which the 
ursinoid repeated docilely enough. 

“At one-one-five on your dial, 
check visual to make sure you are 
well below their horizon. Do not 
use energy of any sort until you 
are two units past horizon. Cap- 
tain, that is vital. After that you 
are on manual. Brake as hard 
as you can, observing the center 
limit display and — ” 

“After that I know,” interrupted 
Imray. “You take care ship. Now 
1 go, vernt?*' 

“You are now go,” said Sylla, 
motioning to Pomeroy. 

“Gespro-oo — ” trumpeted the 



voder before Pomeroy cut it. 

“What does that mean?” asked 
Quent. 

“I’ve never known,” said 
Svensk. “Some obscure mamma- 
lian ritual.” 

“Our Captain was formerly a 
torch gunner,” Sylla told Quent. 
“But perhaps you — ” 

“I’ve heard of them,” said 
Quent. “But I thought — ” 

“That’s right,” said Pomeroy. 
“Ninety-nine per cent casualties. 
Flying bombs, that’s all. He can 
run that thing, once he gets 
down.” 

“He will be out of the moon’s 
shadow and into their sensor field 
in fifteen seconds,” said Svensk. 
“One trusts he remembers to de- 
activate everything.” 

P OMEROY switched up. They 
heard Imray humming as he 
tore planet-ward at full thrust. 
Sylla began chopping futile cut- 
power signals. The humming rum- 
bled on. Pomeroy squeezed his 
eyes, Sylla chopped harder. Svensk 
sat motionless. 

The rumble cut off. 

“No more emissions. His 
course appears adequate,” said 
Svensk. “I suggest we retire to a 
maximally shielded position and 
signal Farbase.” 

“Impellors, Mr. Morgan,” said 
Quent. 

When Sylla put up his Jist 
Quent followed it until they 



38 



IF 




reached a deep crater which 
would block the scatter of their 
star-to-star caller. 

“If we’re in luck,” said Pom- 
eroy, “Farbase can get . their tea- 
kettle here in three days, plus or 
minus a week. All they have is a 
ferry for picking up pieces. 
Bound to be pieces — of some- 
body.” He sighed. “Let’s get 
back where we can hear ’em.” 

They tiptoed back to the hori- 
zon. The Drakes below them gave 
no sign of detecting the approach 
of Imray’s meteor. Neither did 
they reveal any intent to use their 
ship to fire the town. As the moon 
on which the Rosenkrantz was 
riding sank below the horizon of 
the field they were obliged to 
leave it and maneuver into full 
sun-blast. Quent’s eyes burned; 
he was becoming aware that he 
had scarcely slept for a week. 

“If only we could give one little 
burn planetward,” Sylla chafed. 
“How soon, my scientific friend?” 
“With their drive off — well — 
they would be able to read ship- 
sized burst from our present orbit 
for at least another hundred de- 
grees of planetary rotation,” said 
Svensk. “Don’t you agree, 
Quent?” 

Quent nodded wearily. “And 
that A.E.V. has about double our 
acceleration and six times our 
rocket range and can turn inside 
us. We wouldn’t have a prayer.” 

He had said it twice before. 



The lutroid spat dryly and put 
his elbows on his console. 
Pomeroy sat, hands cupped over 
his earphones, motionless. 

“Emission,” said Svensk sud- 
denly. “Imray is down and 
braking.’ 

“That damn ship hasn’t even 
budged,” Pomeroy said. “I can 
still hear them yakking to the 
shore party. We’re all wrong.” 

“Still braking. It just occurs 
to me, there was space for two 
more chutes.” 

“He requires rather two more 
gravity webs,” said Sylla. “He is 
mad.” 

“Torchers,” said Pomeroy. 

“There is some distortion for 
which I cannot compensate,” 
Svensk complained. “He is very 
close to their horizon — ah — I be- 
lieve he has managed to deflect.” 

“That ship isn’t going any- 
where,” Pomeroy fumed. 

“If I could suppress this 
wretched bias,” said Svensk. “He 
is on impellors now, I think. But 
moving very erratically.” 

“He finds perhaps a ravine.” 
Sylla was kneading his console. 

“Toward the field again,” said 
Svensk. “Much too near. One 
fears that he is omitting to wait 
for them to lift.” 

“The old maniac will sail right 
onto their screens,” Pomeroy 
groaned. 

“While we sit here,” Sylla mut- 
tered. 



HAPPINESS IS A WARM SPACESHIP 



39 




“If he’s in that canyon back of 
the field,” said Quent, “he might 
sneak under their shield. Pro- 
vided they weren’t looking. It’s a 
fairly broad target. Can he — ” 

Sylla’s head had snapped 
around. 

“He understands to shoot,” he 
told Quent. 

“Can I rely on that, Mr. Sylla?” 

Quent met the lutroid’s yellow 
stare. 

“Accelerating on the same line,” 
Svensk announced. “Dismal.” 

“Got it!” Pomeroy shouted. 
“Secure locks — but there isn’t 
time. Up, you bastards! Up!” 

“How long before he cuts their 
line of sight, Mr. Svensk?” 

“This detestable — at ground 
level, maximum two minutes. 
Much too close. They’re bound to 
spot him.” 

“Over to me on manual, Mr. 
Sylla,” said Quent. “If you can 
get to the wrecking lasers it’ll help 
the display. Ready, Mr. Mor- 
gan?” 

The lutroid shot over him and 
down the shaft. 

“Stay braced and warn Apple- 
by!” Quent yelled after 
him, coding for drive. “If Imray 
can hit what he shoots at, this’ll 
distract them. If not — ” 

He rammed home the lever and 
they pitched in their webs. As the 
screens faded the planet bloomed 
up and swirled crazily. 

“We’re in their sensors now,” 



gasped Svensk. “I believe — ” 

“They’re lifting.” Pomeroy was 
plastered on his board. “They see 
us.” 

Quent bent the Rosenkrantz 
into an atmosphere-grazing turn. 
Pomeroy was struggling to move 
a switch. The bridge filled with 
Drake voices, reverberating lash- 
back. A siren honked. 

The voder cut off. For a flash 
Quent thought his eardrums had 
gone but as acceleration topped 
out he heard the others fill their 
lungs. 

“Their shield does appear to 
have collapsed,” said Svensk. “I 
can’t be positive in this — ” 

“He got them!” Pomeroy 
yelled. “Power’s gone! Wait — 
they’re coming back on emer- 
gency. Listen to ‘em cry!” 

Noises blared from the Drake 
ship. 

“Where’s Imray?” 

Quent threw in the retros and 
they pitched again. Sylla came 
scrambling out of the shaft and 
hung onto Imray’s chair. 

“Where is he?” 

“I can’t at the moment,” 
Svensk protested. “The resul- 
tants — ” 

“Listen.” Pomeroy tuned the 
uproar to ululating wails. “The 
Denebian national anthem.” He 
flopped back in his seat, grinning. 
“Might as well go get him — that 
ship’s dead in the dirt. He 
cracked one up their landleg sock- 



40

et while they were gawking at us. 
Must have been bloody under 
’em!” 

Quent jolted to a thump on the 
back. Sylla climbed down, grin- 
ning. 

Svensk arched his neck — his 
bony beak was not adapted for 
expression. 

“Is he all right?” called Apple- 
by’s voice. “I fixed some hot jam 
truffles.” 

“So that was the anomaly,” 
said Svensk. “Incredible. The 
nutritive drive of the human fe- 
male.” 

“Bloody good, too,” said Pom- 
eroy. He jerked to his board. 
“Holy Space — ” 

“What is it?” 

“The Jasper just hailed us,” he 
told them, “She’s coming by. 
Five minutes earlier and we’d all 
been up the pipe.” 

He sagged again and reached 
for his bulb. 

“By the Path!” Imray howled 
on the voder. “You pick me up or 
I sprucher you too.” 

Q uent was clumsy with ex- 
haustion by the time they got 
the rocket module stowed and the 
hot drive unit back to Morgan. 
He glanced at the wrecker ports 
and then followed the others to 
the bridge where Pomeroy was 
watching the grounded Drakes. 

“I take over, son.” Imray 
sprawled in his command chair. 



wrinkling his hide luxuriously. 
“Watch tight. Bad mess they get 
loose before Farbase come.” 

He chomped a jam tart. 

“Are you all ready for the bad 
news?” Pomeroy wheeled around 
to face them. “Remember that 
Gal News man we ducked at Far- 
base? He’s on the shuttle. Coming 
here.” 

Imray choked. 

“Wants to interview you,” 
Pomeroy pointed at Quent. “And 
Appleby, too.” 

Quent shut his eyes. 

“He can — why won’t they let 
me alone?” 

Absently he fingered the laser 
by his console. 

“Admiral Quent’s son in battle 
with Drake pirates,” Pomeroy 
grinned sourly, “While Admiral 
Coatesworth’s fiancee cheers? His 
board’s all lit up.” 

“This rather cooks it,” said 
Svensk. 

Sylla was drumming his claws. 

They all looked at Quent. 

“What you tell him, son?” 

“Tell ’em.” Quent muttered ex- 
haustedly. “Why, I’ll tell ’em the 
ship stinks and your computer is 
full of mush — and the engine- 
room is a fugnest — ” his voice 
rose — “infested by a spook who 
has you so terrorized you have to 
bribe him to move ship. And my 
fellow officers are a set of primi- 
tive jokers captained by a maniac 
who has to resort to physical

force — and the only humans who 
can stand the ship are an un- 
shaven alcoholic and a madwom- 
an who buggers the sensors with 
fudge-machines and underwear.” 
He rubbed his neck. ”My first 
ship. Look, Fm going to sack out, 
right?” He pushed off for the lad- 
der. 

“You tell them that?” Imray 
demanded, beaming. “Flying 
fugnest?” 

“Hell no, why should I? It’s 
not true.” 

He pulled into the shaft and 
rammed into Imray’s hard paw. 

“Son, you got to.” 

“//wA.?” 

“Tell them can’t stand. Want 
new job. Must!” Imray was 
shaking them both for emphasis. 

“Wait — one — minute.” Quent 
disengaged himself. “That’s ex- 
actly what you were putting me 
on to think, wasn’t it? But why?” 
He frowned around at them. 
“Why? I mean, hell, I’m for inte- 
gration.” 

“Precisely the problem,” said 
Svensk. 

Imray whacked his thigh ex- 
asperatedly. 

“Who you think build this 
boat?” 

“Well, it’s a human design — ” 

“Human fix up. Is build by 
Svensk’s people, original. Was 
part their navy. Space Force say, 
indefinite loan. Little boats, you 
never hear. Space Force come 
along, make treaty. Suck up little 



boats. Even ants they got some 
type space boat, vernt, Svensk?” 
“More of a pod, I believe.” 
Svensk crossed his long legs. 

“Something, anyway. Son, you 
think like your father say, all 
en-aitch people want integrate 
with Space Force?” 

“Well, uh,” said Quent. “The 
Gal Equality party.” 

“Sure, sure.” Imray nodded. 
“Some en-aitch people want be of- 
ficer big starship, is fact. Also fact, 
en-aitch people want have say in 
Gal Council. But is different here.” 
He leaned back, folded his 
arms. 

“Here is original en-aitch space 
force, us little boats. We been on 
these boats long time. Long, long 
time. We been patrol since was 
no sector, eh, Syll? When humans 
come with us, is only individual 
humans. One here, one there. 
Pom know. But we not integrated 
with you. You is integrated with 
us.” 

“Bravo!” cried Sylla. 

“Hear, hear,” said Svensk 
gravely. 

“But, what — ” said Quent. 

“The captain means,” Pomeroy 
told him, “that he’s not about to 
get integrated with the Space 
Force. None of us are. We do our 
Job. They can stow their sociolo- 
gical programs. Their directives. 
Channels. Personnel fitness pro- 
files. Rotation and uptraining 
tours. Pisgah! If this integration 
trial business goes green, we’ve

had it. And—” he poked his fin- 
ger at Quent — “you are a prime 
test case. Lieutenant.” 

“Even Morgan they steal,” 
Imray rumbled angrily. 

Quent opened his mouth, 
closed it. 

“We were so confident,” said 
Svensk. “It did seem ideal, when 
you turned out to be Admiral 
Quent’s son. We felt it would be 
simple to impress you as being, as 
it were, quite unintegrable,” He 
sighed irritatedly. “I may say 
that your determined optimism 
has been a positive nightmare.” 

“Let me get this straight.” 
Quent scowled. “You wanted me 
to yell so hard for reassignment 
that the program would be 
shelved?” 

“Correct.” 

Sylla slapped his console. The 
others nodded. 

“What about this flimflam here 
in Sopwith?” 

“Too fancy,” grunted Imray. 

“We were getting desperate,” 
said Pomeroy. “You just wouldn’t 
discourage. So we thought maybe 
we could work it the other way, 
build up a case that would con- 
vince the Gal Eq crowd that hu- 
mans weren’t ready to, ah — ” He 
looked away. “Well, you figured 
it.” 

“I knew you were out to clobber 
me,” Quent said grimly. “Only I 
thought it was my father.” 

“It was in no way personal, 
Quent,” Sylla assured him hearti- 



ly. “Believe me, we would do the 
same for anyone, nonV 
“But this is insane!” Quent pro- 
tested. “How can you? I mean, do 
you realize my father got me as- 
signed here? He’s sure I’ll come 
around to his way of thinking and 
furnish him with political ammuni- 
tion to use against integration.” 
“That rather optimises things, 
doesn’t it?” Svensk rattled his 
neckplates. “Increased familial 
solidarity is a plus value for pri- 
mates.” 

Quent snorted. 

“What were you supposed to be, 
Mr. Spock? I knew damn well 
you’re a Gal Tech graduate. You 
should have taken the course on 
oedipal conflicts. Also the one on 
ethics,” he added acidly. “Some 
primates set quite a value on 
truth.” 

“But you’ve got to help us. Lieu- 
tenant,” Pomeroy said urgently. 

Quent was preoccupied. “How 
many languages do you speak, 
anyway? There was a Pomeroy who 
wrote some text — ” 

“Lieutenant! Look, we’ll all 
help fix up a tale of woe you can 
give them — ” 

“Are you serious?” He looked at 
them, appalled. “You expect me

Lie about you and the ship?” 
“What one little lie?” Imray’s 
voice sank to the crooning tone he 
used on Morgan. “Son, you good 
spacer. Save ship, verntl You say

finish. You not let Space Force 
mess up old Rosy, son.” 

“But goddammit,” Quent ex- 
ploded. “It’s not just one lie. It’d 
go on and on — investigations, ap- 
peals — my father smirking around 
with the Humanity Firsters trum- 
peting every word I said on one 
side — and the Gal Eq people 
reaming me from the other. I’d 
never be free of it. Never. How 
could I function as a space offi- 
cer?” 

He rubbed his head wearily. 
“I’m sorry. I’ll say as little as pos- 
sible, believe me. But I will not put 
on any act.” He turned to go be- 
low. 

“So stubborn, the humans,” 
Sylla snarled. 

Quent continued down the lad- 
der. 

“Wait, Quent,” said Svensk. 
“This publicity you dread can’t be 
escaped, you know. Suppose you 
say nothing. The facts speak for 
themselves. Gal Eq will be deliri- 
ous: Arch-racist's Son leads Non- 
human Attack on Human Pirates, 
for starters. Prolonged cheers. All- 
Gal network showing the hero and 
his en-aitch pals. I daresay they’ll 
nominate you Tor the next Amity 
award. Really, you’re just as well 
off doing it our way.” 

Quent stared at him in horror. 

“Oh, no. No.” He began to 
pound his forehead on the ladder. 
“It’s not fair.” His voice cracked. 
“I thought when I got to space 



they’d let me alone. It ’s been bad 
enough being Rathborne Quent 
Junior, but this — spending the 
rest of my life as a — a ventrilo- 
quist’s dummy for Integration 
politics. Everywhere I go! Every 
post, my whole career. How can I 
be a spacer?” 

Imray was shaking his head. 
“You natural victim social situa- 
tion, son, looks like. Too bad.” He 
exhaled noisily, and licked a piece 
of jam off his fist. “So, is settled. 
You going help us, vernt?" 

Quent lifted his head. His jaw 
set. 

“No, I told you. That’s out,” he 
said bleakly, “I didn’t come into 
the service to play games.” His 
voice trailed off. “Call me next 
watch, right? We’re all pretty 
weary.” 

“Sure, sure,” said Imray. “Syli, 
Svenka, you boys go. We got time 
think something.” 

“Forget it,” Quent told him. 
“There’s no way out of this one.” 
he sighed, hauling down the shaft. 
“I wish I could just disappear.” 

He stopped dead and looked up 
thoughtfully. 

“Ah-ah,” he said. 

He climbed back up and col- 
lected the lasers. The last thing he 
remembered was leaning back on 
his hammock fully dressed with a 
laser in his hand. 

G al newsmen yelled at him, 
crowds jostled him. The bridge 



44 



IF 




of the Adastra swarmed with kav- 
rots. Quent came groggily awake, 
sure that he had heard a lock open. 
But the ship seemed to be normal. 
He sank back and dreamed that he 
v\ras wearing a clangorous glass 
uniform. When the cocoon grab- 
bed at him Quent struggled to con- 
sciousness. The Rosenkrantz was 
going into full star drive. 

He plunged into the shaft and 
found himself nose to nose with an 
unknown girl. 

“Gah!” 

“Hello, Lieutenant,” she said. 
“Want some breakfast?” 

She was a dark girl in silver 
coveralls. 

“Who — who’re you?” 

“I’m Campbell, your new log 
off,” she smiled. 

“Drakes.” He hurled himself 
headlong for the bridge. “Where 
are they? What’s happened?” 

“Hi, there,” said Pomeroy. The 
others looked up from their con- 
soles. They seemed to be drinking 
coffee. 

“Where are we headed? Where 
did she come from?” 

“Sit, son,” said Imray genially. 
The dark girl bobbed up to place 
a bulb of coffee on his console. 

“Is she a Drake?” 

“Good heavens, no.” 

She laughed. Quent blinked. 
The conformation under the cover- 
all was interesting. 

“I’m a duck,” She vanished. 
Dazedly Quent gulped some 



coffee. 

“How long was I asleep? Farbase 
— they’ve come and gone, right?” 

“Not likely.” Pomeroy snorted. 
“They won’t get to Sopwith for 
thirty hours yet.” 

“But who’s watching the 
Drakes?” 

“The Rosenkrantz, who else?” 
said Sylla, dead-pan. 

“What? Captain Imray, what is 
going on?” 

Imray waved his paw. 

“Problem finish, son.” He 
belched comfortably. “We fix, eh, 
boys?” 

“Oh, God.” Quent squinted at 
them. He gulped some more coffee. 
“Mr. Pomeroy, you will explain 
yourself.” 

“Well, you can forget about that 
newsman and all that,” Pomeroy 
told him. “When he gets to Sop- 
with he’ll find' the Rosenkrantz and 
he’ll find Miss Appleby all right — 
but he won’t find you. Nobody’ll 
find you.” 

“Why not?” Quent , glared 
around nervously. 

“Because you are no longer on 
the Rosenkrantz,"" said Svensk. 
“Brilliant, really, your notion of 
disappearing. Since we could 
scarcely remove you from the 
Rosenkrantz, we simply removed 
the Rosenkrantz from you.” *He 
stretched pleasurably. “Solves 
everything.” 

What have you done now?** 

“Observe!” Sylla pointed to the

sealed log certificates. 

Quent pulled himself over wari- 

ly- 

“P-B 640T J-B,” he read. “But’s 
that’s wrong. That’s not — ” 

“Peebee Jasper Banks, that is.” 
Pomeroy chuckled. “We’re the 
Jasper Banks now, see?” 

“What?” Quent pawed at the 
case. “Those are official seals. 
You—” 

“Not to worry, it’s just tempo- 
rary. Jasper owed us a couple of 
favors. They were glad to oblige. 
Fact, they wanted to head back to 
Central anyway. So we just traded 
registry and log officers and gave 
them our mail. They took over the 
DrakesTsee?” 

“But that’s — ” 

“Beautiful,” Pomeroy nodded. 
“Gfl/ News can pull the Jasper 
apart, they never heard of you. No 
one ever actually saw you on Rosy, 
did they? He’ll figure it’s some gar- 
ble. Has to — there’s Appleby; all 
as advertised. And the Drakes. 
He’ll have to be satisfied with that. 

Quent took some more coffee. 
He felt like a man trying to shake 
off a bad dream. 

“And the beauty part,” Pome- 
roy went on, "'‘Jasper s an .all-Hu- 
man peebee. That’ll really befuddle 
them.” 

“No integration aspect left,” 
said Svensk. “Gal Eq will be 
dashed.” 

“It can’t work. It’s — what about 
Appleby?” 



“I hope this one as good cook,” 
muttered Imray. 

“Appleby’s fine — she never 
heard of you,” Pomeroy assured 
him. “Morgan let her have these 
crystals she’s always wanted, see?” 

“Uh. But— they’re going back 
to Central as us? What happens 
there? Personnel. My father.” 

“Personnel,” Pomeroy scoffed. 
“They’re dingled up half the time. 
They won’t get their circuits 
flushed till we’ve swapped back.” 

“But my father — ” Quent 
yelped. “When do we trade back?” 

“When we intersect, bien sure,"' 
said Sylla. 

“When’s that? Hold it. Wasn’t 
the Jasper headed on some job 
away out?” 

“That’s right,” said Pomeroy. 
“The wild sector. Thirteen-zed, 
they call it. Wasn’t due to start 
patrol there for a while but they 
got this emergency call. So they 
sent out the Jasper. That’s us, 
now.” 

“Quite remote and unexplored, 
really,” said Svensk, stretching. 
“Challenging.” 

“New patrol good job,” Imray 
grunted. “You want be spacer, 
son, verntl Nobody mess your 
career out there.” He scratched 
his broad chest contentedly. “Inte- 
gration program? Pfoo! Never 
catch.” 

“You mean we start patrolling 
out there? And they take our old 
one. When do we trade back with

JasperT^ 

“Assuming our circuit is, say, 
twice the length of theirs,” Svensk 
ruminated, “and assuming they 
keep near schedule, the perinode 
should precess around — ” 

“Spare me.” 

Quent’s big jaw began to grind 
and he breathed forcefully. The 
reaction pushed him slowly out of 
his console. He hooked one leg 
around his seat back and hung 
over them scowling. 

“My career,” he said tensely. 
“Your unspeakable solicitude. 
Sixty days on my first duty 1 find 
myself involved in an actionable 
conspiracy. First officer of a vessel 
under fraudulent certification, on 
an illegal course in defiance of or- 
ders — without one clobbing prayer 
of ever getting back into anything 
resembling legal status. My career. 
Who’d believe me? What happens 
when — gentlemen, did it never 
cross your conniving minds that 
this is a general courts offense?” 
He reached out and laid his hand 
on the emergency starcall cradled 
between him and Imray. “My only 
sane course is to bring this to a halt 
right now — regardless.” 

He yanked the caller from its 
cradle. 

They gaped at him. Sylla’s ears 
folded back. 

“Lieutenant, no,” said Pome- 
roy. , 

Quent fingered the starcall. His 
solemn face was corded. 



“What’s the nature of this emer- 
gency, Mr. Pomeroy?” 

“Some en-aitch trQuble,” Pome- 
roy spread his hands. “Signal split 
before they got much. They gave 
ihQ Jasper some stuff — ” 

“Three argon cylinders, one case 
of mudbinds, one pan-venom kit,” 
said Miss Campbell from the 
shaftway. “And an incubator.” 

She placed a breakfast server on 
Quent’s console and departed. 

“You figure it, sir,” Pomeroy 
chuckled hopefully. 

Quent’s face did not soften. He 
tapped a square nail on the star- 
call, slowly, desperately. Nobody 
moved. Sylla’s leg muscles 
bunched stealthily; Quent’s free 
hand drifted to the laser. There 
was a faint slithering sound. 
Quent’s jaw jerked around to 
Svensk. 

The big saurian’s fingers came 
away from his vest and he 
stretched ostentatiously, jogging 
the computer. 

Roll on, thou deep and dark 
blue ocean, roll! 

Ten thousand fleets 

Quent slapped it silent with the 
laser. He lifted the starcall. 

“No, son, no,” Imray protested. 

Quent drew a deep breath. For a 
moment the Jasper Banks nee 
Rosenkrantz fled on through the 
abyss in humming silence. The 
aroma of bacon drifted through

her bridge. Quent’s face began to 
work convulsively. 

""Kavrots"" he muttered. 

He let out an inarticulate howl. 

Sylla’s reflexes carried him into 
the bow grips and Pomeroy dived 
under his board. They goggled at 
Quent. He was making a wild 
whooping noise which they could 
not at first identify. 

Then Pomeroy crawled out, 
grinning, and Imray’s shoulders 



started to quake. 

Quent roared on. His face was 
astounded, like a man who hasn’t 
heard himself guffawing whole- 
heartedly in years. Invisible 
around him, ghosts of i\\Q Adastra, 
Crux, Sirian shriveled away. 

“All right,” he gasped, sobering. 
He pushed the starcall and the 
laser back in place and reached for 
his breakfast. “Kavrots. So be it. 
Who’s on watch in this fugnest?”^

pROPPED tiredly against a 
^ bank of electronic receivers 
in the tower, oozing sweat and 
scotch from his pores. Colonel 
Ward anxiously scanned the 
Manoc landing strip for General 
Metzger’s C-52. The general could 



IRWIN ROSS 



r 



49 




have only one reason for visiting 
Manoc at this time — to check on 
rumors that its commanding 
officer was derelict in his duties 
and drinking to a degree 
unbecoming an officer. 

The squawk box kept nagging 
at him. He paid little attention to 
it. Radar had picked up 
something. That something was 
streaking along at seventy 
thousand feet and at an estimated 
two thousand miles per hour. 
Should an element of jets be sent 
up? 

“Disks.” Ward sneered. 
“Meteors.” He connected radar 
and leaned over the box to give 
emphasis to his words. “Sergeant, 
if you track just one more flying 
saucer and interrupt me, I’ll — get 
on the ball, sergeant.” 

He snapped at the towerman. 
Didn’t he know that General 
Metzger was coming in? Why 
hadn’t he aborted that last flight of 
jets and cleared the runways? 

Ward slammed the door going 
out. In the jeep, on the parking 
raipp, he lit his fifteenth cigarette 
since 0700 that morning. Ashes fell 
on his immaculate uniform and he 
brushed them off angrily. The 
sharply pressed uniform was in 
atonement for the scotch. For six 
months, while his reputation 
declined, he had progressed in the 
art of being the well-dressed man. 

What was a military man, 
anyway? Did he wear the bullet 



scar, canting over a bloodshot eye 
like an extra eyebrow, as a badge 
of honor? Should he laugh at being 
grounded, physically decayed at 
forty and shelved behind a desk? 
Should he complacently accept 
the fact of his wife’s death --her 
destruction before his very eyes 
from cancer? Or did a man, even a 
military man, have a right to seek 
whatever it was that other men 
sought in bottles? 

Well, he had had it all. In- 
cluding the bottles. And now here 
was the general coming to sit in 
judgment over his conduct. 

Ward saw a C-52 go around and 
let down for landing. He started 
the jeep and moved it ahead. The 
general climbed slowly, stiffly 
from the ship. That was a bad sign. 
Adjutants in the Eighth Air Force 
had run for cover when the general 
moved with that stiff-legged walk. 
He was a large man, with a full 
head of iron-gray hair and an iron- 
gray mustache. He squeezed 
himself silently, after one puzzled 
glance at Ward’s uniform, into the 
jeep. 

S IX pilots stood stiffly at atten- 
tion in the green-plushed office 
at operations. Ward glared at 
them. 

“What are you men doing here? 
No flights are scheduled for this 
morning.” 

The general placed himself 
quietly into a corner — watching. 



50 



IF 




“It’s come back,” one of the 
pilots said. “We’d like to make a 
gunnery run on it.” 

“Sir!” Ward snapped. “What’s 
come back?” 

“The missile, sir, that radar’s 
been tracking. It buzzed the tower 
five minutes ago. They’ve plotted 
its course — it’s swinging in a 
hundred-mile circle and reducing 
speed. About mach one.” 

Ward frowned. What did they 
expect him to do? Buckle their 
harnesses for them? 

“If the thing’s circling, then it’s 
not a meteor,” he growled, 
singling out the flight leader. 
“Why didn’t you alert your ele- 
ment and take after it?” 

“Your orders were — ” 

“If you can’t think for yourself 
you’re not qualified to lead men. 
Adams, you take over the flight. 
Ruppert, you fly his wing. Now get 
out of here.” 

The general said nothing. He 
had obviously come simply to 
observe. And observe he would. 

In ten minutes the desk squawk 
box began chattering. It was the 
tower. The towerman had the 
thing in h'\s glasses, guessed it was 
traveling at about three hundred 
miles per hour. It seemed to be let- 
ting down for a landing. He could 
see Adams’ flight firing tracers 
and rockets at it, without effect. 
Yes — it was landing. About five 
miles out, on the desert. 

Ward looked at the general. The 



grilling would have to wait. This 
headache came first — something 
spotted by radar, estimated to 
travel at fabulous speeds, 
unmarked, unknown. Maybe even 
a guided missile. But who in the 
world would fire a missile at 
Manoc — when there were New 
York and Washington? 

“I’ll send out a demolition crew 
to bring it in,” he told tower. 

I T WAS neither a meteor nor a 
disk. 

It lay, not mangled from im- 
pact, lightly on the hangar floor. 
Machined as smoothly as an 
artillery shell, devoid of jutting 
airfoils or rocket tubes. 

The general touched the nose 
section, where a delicate script was 
engraved in the metal. 

“It’s a guided missile,” he said. 
“Russian, probably.” 

Ward rubbed his hand over the 
script. “Maybe,” he said. “I’ll get 
a cryptograph man over here.” 

He looked at the thing warily, 
disliking what it meant — the fuss 
and red tape it would occasion. 

Two thousand miles per hour? 
No wings? 

The sergeant cryptographer 
arrived. Ward hurried off to 
rendezvous with a bottle of scotch. 
Back at the hangar at 1755 he 
heard the sergeant through a slight 
rosy haze. 

“I can bust codes based on a 
known language. If this is a 



TO KILL A WORLD 



51 




language the U.N. ought to be 
informed. You need a philolo- 
gist.” 

Not a sound from the missile. 
Demolition experts pronounced 
that it might explode. Might not. 

“Check again,” Ward ordered. 

The general eyed him curiously. 

They said there was no other 
check they could make. 

“Bust it open,” the general 
ordered gruffly. 

Ward frowned. He was still C.O. 
here. He faced the general. 

“Hold on. We’ll get an im- 
pression of that script before 
anyone blows himself up. You can 
take it back to Washington. 
Sergeant, post a guard here and 
keep the area clear — until I say 
otherwise.” 

The general smiled wryly. By 
2100 hours he was airborne. 

Ward, feeling burned out sucked 
the bottle. The general would wire 
his request for Ward’s resignation 
from Washington. It was a fact, 
written in his eyes. Ward felt 
relieved. There was nothing now to 
hold him — he had no front to 
maintain. He opened another 
bottle. 

At 2318, slightly fuzzy, he wired 
Chicago. They said they would put 
a philologist aboard a jet. 

He was not yet drunk when, five 
hours later, the philologist arrived. 

Ward shook the old man’s hand 
somberly. 

“Had to get you here fast. Dr. 



Neuman,” he explained, “to 
decipher a script we can’t identify. 
SOP on delivered but unidentified 
packages is to check on the sender. 
It might be a bomb. You 
understand that this is top 
secret?” 

The doctor smiled ruefully. An 
hour later he had ceased smiling. 

After two days. Ward noticed. 
Dr. Neuman’s face had become 
actually grim. Ward sweated out 
the general’s TWX, drank scotch 
and played poker at the officers’ 
club with Major Vickers, Chief 
Flight Surgeon; Captain Hut- 
chinson, Assistant; and the 
bartender. 

On the third day old Dr. 
Neuman placed a paper on Ward’s 
desk. 

Ward stared at it. “We didn’t 
think it was Russian,” he said. 
“No earthly origin? Well, I’ll be 
damned,” 

C OLONEL WARD stood by 
while they opened the “can.” 
The general’s TWX had come, 
blunt, unembellished. He would 
get a jolt when, together with 
Ward’s complying notice of resig- 
nation, he received the TWX 
about the script being Martian. 
No philologist had called Martian, 
of course — simply no earthly 
origin. Alien intelligence. 

They pried open the can. 

Ward watched a mechanic peer 
inside the hole. 



52 



IF 




Then: “Jesus — God! There’s 
somebody in here.” 

It was human, all right. 
Strapped to a bulkhead, sucking 
oxygen from a metal mask. 

Medics carried it to the hos- 
pital, where it lay, unconscious. 

It was out of form, as though 
having lived in a twisted world 
— limbs swollen at the extremities 
and tapering inward toward the 
body, giving it a comic-^strip 
appearance. Head ovoid and 
smooth with features that seemed 
to be painted on like those on an 
Easter egg. And washed all over 
with an egg-yolk yellow. 

Martians looked like that, huh? 
Venusians? Who? 

No earthly origin. 

Ward returned to operations 
and smoked one cigarette off the 
end of another. Stubble adorned 
his chin. He felt better with the 
stubble and with the uniform 
rumpled. In a couple of days he 
would be out for good and able to 
slouch around in sneakers and a T- 
shirt. 

Then Hutchinson called from 
the hospital. Major Vickers, he 
said, had suddenly conked out. He 
was turning egg-yolk yellow. 

Something stirred in Ward’s 
brain. Something cold and 
nebulous formed into a premo- 
nition. 

The phone kept ringing. Within 
an hour it had informed him that 
five medics had dropped and 



turned yellow — that they vomited 
violently, then lay like dead men. 

Ward slapped a quarantine on 
the whole post. 

Captain Hutchinson jeeped 
from the hospital. Disheveled and 
exhausted, he had not wanted to 
break away. 

“You need a drink,” Ward said. 
He poured the liquor. “What do 
you think. Captain?” 

The phone jangled again. It was 
the tower — General Metzger’s 
ship was over the field, radioing 
for landing instructions. 

Ward hesitated. He plugged in a 
desk mike. 

“Sorry, General — we’ve got an 
epidemic here. Field one hundred 
per cent restricted.” 

“Metzger speaking. I’ve got 
your replacement aboard. Give me 
landing instructions. Ward — no 
nonsense.” 

Ward took a deep breath. 

“General, get this. I’ve notified 
MATS and Flight Service. If you 
touch a wheel to Manoc, I’ll have 
to slap you in the guardhouse. This 
is an emergency. The field is quar- 
antined and restricted.” 

He watched through the window 
as the General’s C-52 flew over the 
runway once, wheels up, banked 
and headed back east. He grinned 
wryly, visualizing Metzger trying 
to fit this development into head- 
quarters SOP. 

Hutchinson had poured and 
swallowed another drink. 



TO KILL A WORLD

“Colonel, we’ve worked like 
dogs and can’t stop it. It’s one of 
two things.” 

He reached for the bottle. Ward 
snatched it. 

“You’ve had enough. This is no 
time to get drunk.” 

The captain stared at him, 
tense, almost sneering. 

“Isn’t it?” 

Ward turned, chopping down his 
anger. He snapped his fingers at 
the clerk across the room. 

“Sergeant, I want you to close 
all post bars for an indefinite 
period. Absolutely no drinking.” 
He faced Hutchinson. “Let’s get 
to work. Captain. If you have any 
opinions, state them.” 

Hutchinson’s face went slowly 
white. He spoke swiftly. 

“Only theories. That thing at 
the hospital is no Terran, as they 
say in space fiction. We’ve 
established that. We find he’s 
polluted with an unknown but 
highly contagious disease. De- 
duction — wherever he comes from 
might be plagued with the 
disease.” 

“Rats leaving the sinking ship?” 

“Yes.” 

“Any alternate theory?” 

The captain looked squarely at 
Colonel Ward. 

“Disease warfare,” he said. 
“Invasion.” 

C OLONEL WARD, in his 
quarters, bent over a micro- 



scope and scrutinized the slide 
that came with the report from 
the hospital lab. After several 
minutes of concentrated effort he 
saw flat specks suspended in the 
fluid of a lung section. 

He pushed back the micro- 
scope, touched fingertips and 
brooded. His eyes rested long- 
ingly on the bed but he shook his 
head savagely to clear it, left the 
room and trudged toward 
operations. 

Martian invasion. Mars was all 
he knew of outer space. So why 
not Mars? And disease warfare — 
dreaded by all and outlawed by 
every country. Perhaps now a 
reality. It seemed incredible. Who 
would have supposed that beings 
out there would launch a ship 
packed with disease germs? Navi- 
gated by a suicide pilot — who 
himself was the bomb? 

You could not keep a thing like 
this hidden. His cryptographed 
OP messages to Washington had 
finally resulted in alarm. Even 
Metzger reversed his field and 
began slashing red tape. He organ- 
ized an airlift and had it running 
within thirty-six hours. Stuff was 
dumping into Manoc by the ton. 

Ward turned almost eagerly 
into operations. Senses a little 
sharper, brain a little freer, like 
muscles after exercise. Two days 
ago he had anticipated slipping 
away to Mexico. Now he soothed 
a frightened corporal — his ser- 



54 



IF 




geant clerk had toppled — in the 
office. He made hourly personnel- 
health checks. The latest check 
had one half of the post flat on its 
back. 

One half of Manoc’s personnel 
knocked out in thirty-six hours. 
Those were heavy casualties. How 
many enemy casualties? None. 

Hutchinson reported by phone 
at 1100. 

“This Martian doesn’t have a 
trace of rational thought. 
Colonel,” he said. “Damn 
funny — our clinical tests indicate 
he has the thought pattern of a 
low-order mammal. What’s that 
figure?” 

“To me it totals zero. Dammit, 
Hutchinson, how could an 
irrational creature navigate a 
space ship from Mars — or any- 
where — to Earth? How could a low- 
order mammal build the thing in 
first place?” 

“That’s your problem,” 
Hutchinson said. “I’m a doctor. 
I’ll run some more clinical tests.” 

What about the alien ship? 
Ward phoned the hangar and 
quizzed Morgan, flight engineer. 
Morgan sounded incredulous. 

“We’ve dismantled the thing,” 
he said. “You won’t believe 
this — it’s got an atomic propulsion 
system. An atom engine no 
bigger’n my fist. And, man, has it 
got power! Can’t even estimate. 
And we couldn’t find any controls 
aboard. No radio. No nothing.” 



Ward sighed. No controls. And 
yet the thing had been flown in at 
two thousand miles per hour. And 
it had landed perfectly. 

S OMEWHERE in his mind had 
to be some knowledge, some 
germinal fact that he could utilize 
to build a campaign against the 
egg-headed Martian and his stam- 
peding germs before the news 
broke and plunged the country into 
hysteria. All his training could not 
have been for nothing. 

But you could not bomb 
bacteria. Send troops in against 
them? Gas? Tanks? Flame 
throwers? 

Or could you? 

He dialed the phone. 
“Hutchinson? Collect every 
conceivable concoction — serums, 
antitetanus, smallpox vaccine, 
sulfa drugs, penicillin, the 
works — and squirt it at those 
bacteria. Throw the whole damn 
medical book at them.” 

But Hutchinson answered 
distractedly, as though he hadn’t 
heard. 

“Colonel, your Martian or 
whatever is convalescing. Yeah. 
Not a trace of bacteria in the last 
blood test. And that’s not all — ” 
Ward frowned in bafflement. 
Trapped behind this steel desk, he 
felt a bond with the infantryman 
who huddled helplessly in a 
foxhole while hell raged all 
around.

He grunted, “Get over here, 
Hutchinson. On the double.” 

When the captain arrived, he 
seemed to recognize Ward with 
difficulty. 

“Maybe we’d better have a 
drink. Colonel.” 

Ward poured two stiff ones. 

“We did an interesting test 
yesterday.” Hutchinson spoke 
slowly. “We ran an electroen- 
cephalograph on your Martian. 
You know, the machine that 
records electrical pulsations of 
the brain and translates thought 
processes and — ah — sensations 

electronically. Well, we got 
definite but unexpected results.” 
Ward nodded noncommitally. 
He moved a finger around the 
edge of his glass. 

“The encephalograph indicated 
that over a hundred separate brain- 
wave patterns were emanating 
from the alien.” 

Ward looked up. “What?” 

“The same as if we’d focused 
the device on a crowd. Multiple 
thought sources. Multiple brains.” 
Ward’s frown deepened. 
“Previously you reported the 
Martian was irrational. Now he 
has a multiple brain. Make sense.” 
“You figure the sense of it.” 
Hutchinson bridled. “I never 
attended Command and Staff 
School. Today we tested other sick 
patients — and each gave multiple 
brain-wave response. Then we ran 
a dozen airmen, not yet sick. 



through the encephalograph test. 
Each registered one cohesive 
thought pattern. It doesn’t make 
sense. Yesterday the Martian was 
lousy with germs and registering 
multiple thought sources. Today 
he’s germ-free and indicating a 
single source.” 

“Are you certain the en- 
cephalograph is reliable?” Ward 
asked hollowly. He brooded for a 
time, then placed a hand gently on 
Hutchinson’s shoulder. “All 
right. Captain. Thanks. I’m going 
to make a check of my own. Have 
some microscopes sent to the 
hangar. Then get some sleep. 
You’re going to need it.” 

After Hutchinson had left. 
Ward drove the jeep to Hangar 
Two. 

“Who’s in charge here — 
Morgan? Morgan, how do you 
figure this ship was navigated put 
there to Earth and landed 
safely — without controls and only 
an unconscious man aboard?” 

“It don’t figure. Colonel. Maybe 
some kind of telepathic control.” 
“Morgan, this is important. 
Dismantle the Martian ship. 
Completely. Examine every atom 
of it with a microscope.” 

“We already — ” 

“I mean literally. Get some rest 
first. I’ll send around microscopes 
from the lab. Use them and report 
what you find.” 

He drove back to operations. A 
thought was seeded on the edge of 



56 



IF 




his brain. 

T he corporal leaped up when 
Ward entered operations. 
Ward blinked. 

“What’s the matter with you, 
Corporal? Get a messenger here 
on the double.” 

The corporal tripped over his 
own feet in his haste to reach the 
door. Ward frowned at him. 

“Hold on, Corporal. Where 
you going? I meant for you to 
telephone and — ” He stopped. 
“Something’s wrong. Sick?” 

The corporal trembled. 

“N-no. But Captain Hutch- 
inson is, sir, now. And he was here 
only a few . It’s contagious. 
Maybe we’d better — ” Ward 

sighed. He had been dreading this. 

“Don’t leave this room,” he 
said. “You’re losing control of 
yourself.” 

The corporal’s expression was 
pathetic. 

“But nine-tenths of the post has 
got it. Fifty men are dead. In a 
couple of hours itil be too late — ” 
Nine-tenths. 

Ward marveled. Nine-tenths of 
his force was already wiped out. 
He saw the frightened clerk 
moving toward the door. With one 
hand he opened a drawer and 
removed a gun — an Army .45 Colt 
automatic. 

“Corporal,” he said quietly. “If 
you attempt to bolt from this room 
and start a panic — I’ll have to kill 



you. We’ve got to keep the germs 
here, isolated on this post, at all 
costs.” 

The sight of the gun seemed to 
unnerve the corporal completely. 
He sobbed and jerked the door 
open. 

Ward fired. The report crashed, 
surprisingly loud, in the narrow 
office. The corporal dropped. 

By an effort of will — so great 
that it stiffened every muscle in his 
body and covered him with 
sweat — Ward managed to con- 
centrate on the central problem. 

Martian disease . 

Hutchinson was knocked out. 
He would never know what hit 
him. 

He picked up the jangling phone. 
The caller was Private Dean at 
Hangar Two. He said Morgan had 
dropped fifteen minutes ago. 

Ward straightened up. 

“All right. Don’t get panicky. 
Dean. Did you use the micro- 
scopes I had sent over?” 

He listened to Dean’s voice a 
long time, then hung up, ordered 

a messenger from com- 

munications and began to write.

TION MARTIAN SHIP. CON- 
CLUDED EGGHEAD NOT 
REAL MARTIAN. MARTIANS 
INTELLIGENT, ORGANIZED. 
MARTIANS ARE BACTERIA 
REPEAT MARTIANS ARE 
BACTERIA. 

He could accept it once he faced 
it: More or less. Hundreds of 
brainwave patterns emanating 
from a diseased patient suggested 
inevitably that the bacteria had 
brains which were spraying out 
electric pulsations that a machine 
could record. A logically inescap- 
able deduction. Martians — or 
whoever — were bacteria. 

And now the proof. Morgan 
and Dean had detected small, 
invisible — (except to microscopes) 
— controls in the nose section of 
the dismantled ship. Bacteria-size 
controls. Too infinitesimal to acti- 
vate or test. Bacteria had navi- 
gated the compact ship across 
space — it was their invasion. 

Was the strategic problem 
simpler now? It was worse. Or- 
dinary bacteria were bad enough. 
Brainy bacteria were impossible. 
An equally impossible conjecture 
followed. Would they form a 
league — an alliance — with the 
bacteria here on earth? 

Was he cracking up? 

He walked to the window and 
gazed out at the airstrip. He saw 
sleek jets and rockets lined up on 
the ramps. Jets that he couldn’t 
fly — that nobody now would be 



able to fly. 

He was alone. Vickers was gone. 
Hutchinson was gone. The general 
was remote in Washington. 

What was the latest check? 
Sixty-five men? Sixty-five men out 
of two thousand were left on active 
status. A thriving post had been 
reduced to tomblike silence in a 
few days. 

There was a way left, possibly, 
to stop them. Of what use was he 
as a military man if he could not 
stop the enemy? If he failed the 
microbes would advance. They 
would spread beyond Manoc, 
utilizing lizards and birds, perhaps 
as transportation; reach a man, 
then hop from man to man and fi- 
nally creep over the whole of 
Earth, reducing mankind every- 
where to supine flesh. 

Moving slowly to the desk, 
pondering, he picked up the slide, 
held it up reflectively and drew a 
lighter from his pocket. 
Thoughtfully he applied flame to 
the slide, holding it firm until the 
specimen turned black, the plastic 
cracked, and his fingers burned. 

“Dead Martians,’’ he mused 
aloud, dropping the charred slide 
into the wastebasket beside the 
scotch. 

He picked up the phone. 

“Get me General Metzger in 
Washington,” he said. “The 
Pentagon.” 

N OW he had plenty of time. 
Time to shower, shave and

IF 




change into fresh uniform. Eveji 
to sleep. He walked over to the 
hangar. 

It was a good try, he thought, 
fingering the script engraved on 
the nose section. The next try 
would be his. The script, a metal 
document of celestial data, had 
enabled old Dr. Neuman to pin it 
down as the creation of an alien 
intelligence aware of vistas 
unavailable to man. Of course it 
was only guesswork but other ships 
might follow this one. So that 
whatever he did could prove 
inconclusive. His day — and the 
days of his kind — were probably 
done. There was no time left for 
soldiers, for the military — he 
might buy a little time for those 
who would take over. Whether 
human or bacteria. He had felt 
useless for some time. 

The humanlike Martian? You 
could only suppose about him, too. 
A kind of cattle — or food. Carried 
their food right along with them. 
Smart? Maybe they had 
abandoned Mars — or another 
home planet — because their 
human cattle, ravaged by disease, 
were dying off. 

He trudged back to operations, 
stepped gingerly over the corpse in 



his doorway and sat behind the 
desk. It might, he found himself 
thinking, have been interesting to 
talk with intelligent germs. What 
did germs think about, anyway? 

Did they love and hate? 

It was daylight when Colonel 
Ward awoke, hearing a faint, 
throaty drone in the distance. He 
shuffled to the window and peered 
out. The urge to vomit gnawed at 
him but he fought it down. 

He thought a moment about his 
wife, seeing her face and hearing 
her clearly in his mind, feeling a 
kind of pride. 

But it was rather humiliating. 
Colonel Ward thought, to have 
space conquered by bacteria. Put a 
man in his place, didn’t it? 

By craning his neck he could see 
the bomber high up, cruising at 
about fifteen thousand feet, just a 
flash in the sunlight. In a few 
seconds it would be over the field. 
He looked at his watch. Right on 
time. A good man, the general. 
Dependable. 

He stared out at the field, 
watching for it. But he didn’t get 
to see much. Only a sudden 
blinding glare, then a hurricane of 
smoke, mushrooming up and out. 

In a second, it was over. ♦

The price was fine and the 
job was easy — nothing but 
recreating the original Man! 

BARRY ALAN WEISSMAN 



Genemaster, genemaster, make 
me a man. 

Quick as you can. 

Any type man, 

Genemaster, genemaster, true 
can t you see, 

A Galaxy's waiting for we? 

Child’s song, circa 234 G.E. 

T here is a town called Raega, 
on a planet of the same name, 
located somewhere in the West- 
ern Arm of the Galaxy. It’s far 



off the main trade routes, and 
a bit rustic, but I like it. It’s 
home. There is always a carnival 
atmosphere about Raega, with all 
its various types of humanity, 
their foods, dialects, ceremonies 
and customs. I have a shop there, 
a modest one-man procurement 
agency located on a cobbled dark 
alley off the main street, and I do 
a moderately good business. 

It was just before lunch, 2 Juli 
4515 G.E., that the man came in- 



60 




to my shop. I always keep dates. 
It’s a nervous habit due to a slight 
hyperthyroid condition in my in- 
heritance from my parents. Other 
things also are from my parents: 
ambition, drive, high intelligence 
— but no beauty. 

“Beauty is a relative thing — ” 
so goes an ancient folk saying of 
the neoAstrititions I remember 
hearing once. It’s not true in cases 
like mine. But I shouldn’t com- 
plain. I was not bred for beauty. 
My genes were not chosen for ugli- 
ness either. Jt is simply a side ef- 
fect, gene-linked to one of my nec- 
essary virtues. 

But I’m rambling. This guy 
now, tall, about three meters, with 
large purple wings and a medal- 
lion of office on a golden throat 
chain, came into the place as if he 
could buy it with one fingernail. 
(He probably could; they looked 
as if they were painted with plati- 
num.) Some high mucky-muck 
from out near the Rim, planetary 
monarch or something. I remem- 
bered seeing his face in the dailies 
on several occasions. 

“May I help you, sir?” I 
opened, unsure of the correct 
form of address. 

“Are you Gentle-horn denJan?” 
he asked, glancing around at the 
place. It is a bit dingy. But I don’t 
live here, nor does my business al- 
low much time to straighten it up. 

“Yes, I am, and you?” 

He straightened up and an- 
nounced with as much dignity as 



possible, “I am honored to be 
President denZarkos of the Royal 
Taran Hereditary Dictatorship.” 

“I am very pleased to meet 
your highness. If you will but 
have a seat?” 

He looked around him, then 
daintily deposited his posterior in 
a chair by the desk, folding one 
satin-clad leg over the other and 
wrapping his counterbalanced 
tail around his waist like a belt. I 
bet myself that he could really fly 
on his home world; those wings 
did not look like just ornamenta- 
tion. 

“I have a zoo,” he said. “A 
modest little affair, only about 
five hundred basic stocks. Natu- 
rally it would be impossible to get 
all the diverse strains in the gal- 
axy. I doubt if the number is even 
finite.” He looked at me for 
agreement. I nodded, and he went 
on. “I settled for only the repre- 
sentative stocks, and completed 
what I considered the best zoo in 
this Arm about five cycles ago. 
Recently, however, a visiting dip- 
lomat from Centar imformed me 
that I am lacking a most im- 
portant species. An Original.” 

“An Original? But surely, sir, 
the most up-to-date information 
indicates that man arose sep- 
arately on over one thousand 
worlds. I believe that it’s called 
the Convergent Evolution Theory. 
The idea of an Original is a myth 
dating back to before any species 
had achieved space travel and 



IF 



61 




each believed that it was the sole 
holder of intelligence in the uni- 
verse. Why, the finds on — ” 

“No, you’re wrong. But I am 
amazed at your wealth of knowl- 
edge. The diplomat, a very im- 
portant person, I might add, as- 
sured me that recent discoveries 
on a small world near Centar pre- 
date all other discoveries by well 
over a billion cycles, and clearly 
show that the race was just begin- 
ning space travel at that time. He 
didn’t come right out and say it, 
but, he obviously believes that it 
is the Original’s original world; 
the cradle of humanity. It’s 
called — ” he shuffled through 
some papers in his pouch and 
then came up with one and read 
from it — “called Terra.” 

“And you wish one of the in- 
habitants for your zoo?” 

“No. If that were the case I 
would have just dispatched a cap- 
ture expedition. Unfortunately, 
the present locals are the survi- 
vors of a reseeding project. They 
are just dirty barbarians. I want 
an Original, as he was in the ear- 
liest days. Without this most 
basic of all basic stocks my zoo is 
valueless. I must have one. I un- 
derstand that your procurement 
agency is the best in this Sector, 
perhaps in the whole Quadrant, 
although — ” he glanced around 
the room once more — “it certain- 
ly doesn’t look businesslike.” 
“Well, your grace. I’m pleased 
that you have come to us,” T said, 

62 



ignoring his last remark. “I’ll cer- 
tainly do my best to locate an 
Original for you. But I doubt if 
there is one availably, anywhere. 
And even if there is it will be ex- 
tremely expensive to obtain.” 

“I was prepared for both even- 
tualities. As for cost, here — ” he 
handed me a credacard — “is one 
million Imperial Credits. I will 
give you an additional million 
upon delivery to Tara. If you 
can’t find a natural Original, I 
will accept a copy, of at least 95 + 
2% genetic true characteristics. 
Genotype, mind you, not just phe- 
notype. And it should breed true, 
under suitable micromanipulation 
of DNA, so as to get a diploid in- 
dividual from haploid gametes.” 
“Very well, your grace. I’ll do 
my best.” 

He stood and folding his dig- 
nity about him like a cape looked 
around the office again. Then he 
sniffed once and departed. 

A lways begin with the first 
step; it helps to keep one 
from tripping over one’s own 
feet.” My father once told me that 
in a fit of inventing proverbs. It’s 
good advice, and I generally fol- 
low it. The first step on thi# job 
was a visit to Doc’s place. 

Doc was an old transferest. 
Ferns who had been directed by 
the Genetics Board to bear a 
child with undesirable (to them) 
chromosomes could go to Doc and 
he would remicromanipulate the 



GENEAAASTER 




DNA of the fetus into genes more 
of their liking. It played hob with 
the class lines, a Titanoid bearing 
a Prime, for example, but if the 
fern had enough money Doc 
didn’t care. Once the zygote was 
born (or hatched if that was the 
case) it was not often removed. 
The Genetics Board usually 
thought that it was due to their 
error somewhere in the original 
handling of the selection process. 
That occurred all the time; too 
hard not to make errors down 
there at the atomic level. Anyway, 
they didn’t want to penalize the 
victim any more than she had al- 
ready been. Highly illegal act, 
transferring. Doc had done the 
same job for a while on his home 
world of Segal VII, but he hadn’t 
watched the percentages. The 
local G.B. found that too many 
ferns were all of a sudden giving 
birth to unselected offspring, dif- 
fering from the selected character- 
istics by as much as eighty to 
ninety per cent. They began 
searching for wild factor in the 
equations and found Doc at the 
other end of an umbilical cord. He 
would have been shortened then 
and there but he was a distant rel- 
ative of the local duke, so he was 
merely exiled. 

Here he is much more careful. 
He set up a bakery as a front 
(good bread, too) and slowly 
wormed his business into the aver- 
age deviation curve. Here he 



minds the percentages with a ven- 
geance; if caught operating on 
Raega would lose his head. 

Doc was waiting on a customer 
when I came in. He nodded me 
over to a corner while the woman 
to whom he was speaking, about 
seven months gone I noticed, gave 
me suspicious looks. Then he con- 
tinued: 

“Now, now, my dear,” he said. 
“If you had come to see me five, 
or even four, months ago I could 
have helped you.” He glanced at 
her swollen belly. “But now I’m 
afraid that it’s too late. I’m really 
terribly sorry.” His antennae lit- 
erally wiggled in sympathy. “Ir- 
reversible changes have occurred 
in your metabolism,” he contin- 
ued. “making it possible for you to 
carry a Glanceroid zygote. The 
new fetus, no matter what genes, 
would not be able to adapt to 
those conditions, and your body 
could not change to meet its re- 
quirements at this late stage. And 
then there’s the matter of size. 
The new fetus would be at least 
thiry percent smaller. And 
many more reasons. Impossible.” 

She turned and left, probably 
cursing Doc under her breath. 
She’d birth the kid, grow him a 
bit and send him off to the mines 
like the government wanted. Then 
she’d get caught again and be 
back to Doc’s door in a year or so. 
I know the type well. 

“Well, Goodman Jan, what 



IF 



63 




can this humble abortionist do 
for you today? I just got in some 
fine Lambian fetuses. Give them 
some biostim and about two days 
and you could have a couple of 
real nice combination valet-body 
guards. Or is it a few hot rolls 
you’ll be having?” 

“Neither, Doc,” I answered. 
“How about an Original instead? 
For business, not pleasure. And 
what was that word: aaborshton- 
ist?” 

“Abortionist. Ancient form of 
my profession, although not as 
skilled. They were harassed and 
persecuted also.” He shook his 
head sadly, then brightened up. 
“An Original? You mean the orig- 
inal type of man, don’t you?” 

I nodded. 

“An Original. Hummm. How 
much?” 

“I’m getting two mill. I’ll give 
you one-third.” 

“I could use some money. To 
expand the bakery and so forth,” 
he gestured. “I don’t believe that 
you’ll find any naturals, and you 
don’t either or you wouldn’t have 
come to me, right?” 

I nodded again, coming over to 
sit on the counter. 

“What is it?” Doc asked. “Your 
client doesn’t believe in the Con- 
vergent theory?” 

“No, apparently he’s got some 
unreleased info indicating a Di- 
vergent Evolution idea and is 
convinced that we all came from 



one stock ’way back when. Says 
we all come from a world called 
Terra, near Centar.” 

“It’s certainly possible, al- 
though you couldn’t tell now with 
the way we play around with the 
chromosomes. But look, Jan, I 
can assemble any thing you want 
me to, and I do mean any thing, 
but I have to know what charac- 
teristics to chose for. I can’t just 
pick them out of the air.” 

“Especially since the client stip- 
ulated a guaranteed 95+ — 2% 
Original type genotype.” 

“Well then, how are we going 
to get the characteristics?” 

“What about your computers? 
And your books?” 

“Jan, now I’m surprised at you. 
I’m not a wizard and the com- 
puter isn’t magic. We can’t pick 
facts out of the air. Before you 
walked in here today I firmly be- 
lieved that we all evolved sepa- 
rately. Now you expect me to 
have a gene-chart on file of the 
characteristics belonging to a crea- 
ture that I didn’t believe in ten 
minutes ago.” 

“I guess not.” I stood to leave. 
“Wait, Jan. I didn’t say that it 
was impossible. I can do quite a 
lot, but I need some leads. If only 
I had a little more to go on. .” 
“All right. Doc, I’ll see what I 
can do.” 

“Good! And meanwhile I’ll go 
below and see what the computer 
can turn up in the way of univer- 



64 



GENEAAASTER 




sal constants in metabolism and 
so forth.” He showed me to the 
door. “Good luck to you, Jan, and 
good hunting!” 

“And the same to you. Doc.” 

F rom Doc’s place I took an 
aircab to the more legitimate 
Man Market. 

Raega is a big, well-populated 
world. Most basic types, I would 
guess at least ninety per cent of all 
those basics in the galaxy, can be 
found represented in at least one 
individual somewhere, if only in 
the gamete banks and zygote 
farms of the Man Market, where 
one can purchase embryos of 
any size, shape and eating habits, 
from methane-breathing Cajians 
to a building-sized, rock-metabo- 
lism Mercoid. Naturally it was my 
next stop. I didn’t expect to be so 
lucky as to run into a vendor in 
Originals. That would have been 
too much to ask. But maybe I 
could get a lead or two, and may- 
be even a few characteristics. 

As we flew lazily over the 
sprawling slums that stretch out- 
ward from the rich center of town 
my mind turned over the prob- 
lem. Where next? A visit to Terra 
itself? With the high pay involved 
that was a definite possibility. 

Below me I noticed the start of 
a fight between a couple of young 
Titans with shiny blades on their 
fingers and a group of rainbow- 
winged Pteroids. The Titans had a 



grudge, their bellies were empty 
and the Pteroids’ were full. Off to 
the side I could just see the first 
policemen pushing their squat 
forms through the crowd of vari- 
ous shapes and sizes that had 
gathered to watch the diversion. 
They were too late; one of the 
Pteroids was down and hacked to 
death before the cops arrived to 
quell the disturbance with slash- 
ing stun guns. Then the entire 
scene was gone behind me. 

Smells of alien cookery, of 
sweat from a dozen kinds of 
sweat glands, of disease and filth 
that had lain in the streets for un- 
countable days, of lust and hatred 
and old, old grief came up at me 
from the ground. This was hu- 
manity 4515. This was the genus 
Homo. Our species varied with 
the individual: Titan, Mercoid, 
Pteroid, Moid, a thousand more, 
a type for each inhabitable world 
in the galaxy. The planets would 
not adapt to us so we had to 
change to survive on them. And 
here we are today, shattered into 
splinter species, hating and feed- 
ing on one another, competing 
with one another for our common 
heritage of life. The race of men, 
2 Juli 4515. Did all of this come 
from Just one spark of intelligence 
arising on a long forgotten world- 
let out near the Rim in the dark 
ages past? 

I’m a romantic; I wondered 
what he looked like, that first 



IF 



65 




man. That one who was brash 
enough to challenge the universe, 
and smart enough to win his bet — 
only to lose himself, that essence 
that was him, among the over- 
whelming reaches of the galaxy 
and the infinity of different molds 
he had to pour his intellect into to 
suit that infinity of conditions so 
that he might win. So that we 
would be here now, alive and 
kicking, in all our varied shapes. 

The cab landed and woke me 
out of my dreaming. 

“That’ll be three and six, 
Man.” 

“Here, have a five and keep the 
change, Man.” 

The driver shook his tail at me 
in thanks and the cab lifted. 

I checked every livestock dealer 
up and down the Market. No 
luck. No one had even heard of 
Terra, or Terrans, or Originals. 
One Joe said that he had a 
Lamarkoid gamete, and was that 
good enough? 

“Nope,” I told him. “It has to 
be one hundred per cent Terran.” 

A nyway, the Man Market is 
near the Central Post Office 
so I didn’t lose much time. I 
walked the two blocks there, 
through avenues of steamy bars 
and dope joints, noisy crowds and 
shouting vendors selling cakes and 
pottery and human beings, then 
up the sleeping steps into the 
green coolness of the Post Office. 



Mitar was in, the first bit of 
luck on this job. 

“Hello, Mitar, what’s new?” I 
asked. 

“C over lambda equals nu,” he 
said, and then smiled at his little 
joke. “What can I do for you to- 
day? The usual, or do you want 
to mail a letter?” 

“The usual. The usual rates?” 

He nodded. “Come on in.” 

See, it’s this way. Everybody on 
Raega gets letters. It’s a law. A 
couple of decades ago a politician 
promised us a good postal system 
during his campaign, and sur- 
prisingly came through with it 
after his election. So now we have 
the most accurate Post Office in 
this Arm of the galaxy, with com- 
puters and everything to handle 
all the mail. And for the com- 
puters to do a good job they must 
have a record of every individual 
on the planet, their names, ad- 
dresses, and their types, their 
species classification if you like. 
Occasionally, when I have to lo- 
cate someone or some type real 
quick, 1 rent use of the main com- 
puter from Mitar, a swarthy Telo- 
cian with four all-seeing eyes in a 
row around his head who hap- 
pened to be supervisor for the 
main P.O. He never asks me what 
programs I use and I never ask 
him what he does with the money 
I give him. It is not exactly il- 
legal. They haven’t caught us so 
they haven’t passed a law against it.

He showed me to the computer 
and then left, closing the door si- 
lently behind him. I set up my 
programs and fed them in. A few 
minutes later came the feedout:

Things were beginning to break. 

H ospitals are usually thought to 
be antiseptically clean, I un- 
derstand, but Raega Memorial is 
a charity place, and is kept up (or 
rather not kept up) by public 
taxes. Consequently the building 
is a hospital in name only. It is 
understaffed, and the staff under- 
paid. This doesn’t attract the best 
medics. The victims live (and die) 
in smelly squalid wards built to 
hold fifty and containing over two 
hundred in small cramped beds 
that are shared. Too many pa- 
tients, too few beds and too little 
care make Raega Memorial a 
nearly automatic death trap. Al- 



though some do escape, they tell 
me. 

The last attempt at hospitalness 
was a coat of white paint on the 
walls applied about a decade ago. 
Now even this last attempt was 
gone; the once white walls were 
dirty and grease-smeared, written 
all over, chipped and, in some 
places, peeled right down to the 
rusty metal framework. 

The only attempt at grouping 
the patients^ was by their financial 
status; partially self-supporting, 
unable to be self-supporting, and 
the less fortunate. Goodman ten- 
Apla fit into the last catagory. 

I found him in a small bed in 
the cheapest ward in the whole fil- 
filthy place, playing a form of 
poker with his bed-partner, a Sart 
type with a large cancerous growth 
on its feeding appendage. 

“My name is denJan and I’d 
like to speak to you a moment, 
Goodman tenApla,” I said, go- 
ing up to him. He looked up from 
his cards suspiciously. 

“Eh, what’s that? Me?’’ he said 
in a raspy voice. “I know my 
rights! You can’t toss me out 
while I’m sick— and I’m sick, 
terribly terribly sick! Right^ now, 
youngster. I’m in more pain than 
you ever felt in your life. Oooh! 
Oooh!’’ He clutched his stomach 
and went into some very convinc- 
ing convulsions, sending the cards 
flying and therefore somewhat up- 
setting the Sart, who, I saw, had a 



IF 



67 




winning hand. “Call a doctor! 
Call a nurse! I’m dying!’’ 

The Sart tried the bed button 
to summon aid. It sizzled in his 
hand, gave off some pretty purple 
smoke and died. He stumbled out 
of the bed cursing freely in his 
native tongue, an indescribable 
series of grunts and clicks, and 
staggered off down the corridor to 
fetch an attendant. I felt this had 
gone far enough. 

“Cut the dramatics^ citizen. I’m 
not here to kick you out,’’ I said, 
tossing him a golden Imperial to 
prove- my point. He stopped the 
sound effects and made it disap- 
pear, then glared at me again. 

“Who are you, if you’re not an 
inspector? Who else but an inspec- 
tor would want to see me?” 

“I understand that you come 
from Terra.” 

“Oh ho, so that’s what it is. 
Yes, lad, I came from Sol IV in 
my youth, and how I wish that I 
had never left! I still remember 
coming burrowards in the late af- 
ternoon, the twin moons high in 
the sky over the crimson sand 
dunes. But that was long ago, and 
what does that have to do with 
you? Customs, emigration?” 

“No, I’m not connected with 
the government in any way.” This 
seemed to relax him slightly. “I’m 
looking for native Terrans — con- 
ducting a survey — ” I lied, “and 
wonder if you would be so kind as 
to permit me to take a small skin 



sample for our records?” 

“You want my genes, huh? Are 
you a genelegger? Oh well, you 
can have ’em. I’m not so tight 
with ’em any more. Too old to 
have a natural child, and it would 
be nice to know that I’m leaving 
someone behind. Yeh, you can 
have ’em — ” he suddenly grew 
shrewder— “for a price.” He 
looked around at the decrepit sur- 
roundings. “I hate this place. But 
an old man’s got to stay some- 
where. You can have your sample, 
use it for what you will, but for 
one hundred Imperials.” 

I chewed on that for a minute. 
“All right, it’s a deal.” 

“Too quick, youngster,” he 
laughed. “You were prepared to 
pay more. Two hundred credits!” 
“That’s not fair, we had a deal! 
One hundred and fifty!” 

“One seventy-five!” He was a 
sly old dog. 

“One sixty.” 

“Oh, all right, if you throw in 
an ambulance ride to the Viceroy 
Hospital. I’m too old to argue 
long.” 

“Done.” 

I got the sample, a couple of 
cheek smears and a cc of blood. 
Around then the nurse for the 
ward showed up with the Sart, 
and I explained how Goodman ten 
Apia was transfering to the Vice- 
roy. She called for an ambulance 
on her belt radio. 

“Good riddance,” she told me.

and spit at a Thart who was moan- 
ing over in a corner. 

Before the stretcher men arrived 
I asked Dug about his home sys- 
tem. 

“Four’s the only inhabitable 
world,” he told me. “Three is real- 
ly in a more favorable condition, 
but the atmosphere is poisonous, 
too many hydrocarbons and ozone 
— it probably was inhabited at one 
time but it can’t support human 
life now.” 

Then the boys arrived and lifted 
him onto the stretcher. He winked 
his third eye at me as they carried 
him out to the waiting car like a 
lord. Now he had money, and now 
I had some genes. Not originals, 
but close, 

N OW back at Doc’s. He wasn’t 
in front so I rang the bell on 
the glass counter. A door opened 
behind the pastry section and out 
stepped Doc, a big smile on his 
face. 

“I’ve got some good news,” we 
said in unison, then I laughed. 
“You first.” 

He collapsed into a chair, “Af- 
ter you left I got an inspiration to 
pay a visit to the local organ 
bank.” He looked smug. 

“And — ” I started, but he re- 
fused to complete the sentence. 
Doc just sat there smiling. Some- 
thing was up his sleeve: 

Finally, “Come on in here. I 
want to show you something.” 



So for the first time I entered 
Doc’s secret laboratory. It isn’t 
large but it is well equipped for 
its function. An old electron mi- 
croscope, ancient really, but well 
cared for, stood in a corner of the 
small room flanked by rows of 
chemical reagent bottles, stands of 
micro-manipulating tools — and all 
dominated by a mark XIX Geniac 
computer on the opposite waU. In 
the center of the room was a wide 
bench of shiny metal with a mo- 
bile optical scope set up on one 
side and a white porcelain pan on 
the other. Within the pan I could 
see a brownish-red something 
about the size of my fist. 

“What is it?” I asked. 

“What does it look like?” Doc 
was feeling playful. 

“A . heart?” As if to reas- 
sure me it thumped once. 

“Right! And on the first guess 
too. You’d be good on a quiz 
show, Jan. It is indeed a heart, 
but what a heart! Four thousand 
years old at least and maybe 
more.” 

“Where did you get it?” 

“I told you,” he said, smiling. 
“The organ banks. It’s so old that 
they can’t use it on any present 
types. Wouldn’t fit. So they Just 
kept it, for years, in the back of 
the banks, absorbing nutrient 
without producing anything. I 
managed to convince the staff that 
they didn’t want it any more. The 
convincing, by the way, set you

back one hundred Imperials. It 
isn’t an Original, I don’t think, 
but it will give us a good idea as it 
is older than the oldest records of 
artificial DNA manipulation. Now 
what’s your good news?” 

I told him of my experiences 
and gave him the sample bottles. 

“Well, well, well,” he said, tak- 
ing them over to the microscope. 
“Jan, my boy, we might, just 
might, have enough now.” He 
made a slide and looked at it for a 
minute. Then he glanced at me. 
“Why don’t you wait outside for a 
minute while I check a few things? 
I hate having people looking over 
my pseudo-shoulder while I 
work.” 

I could see Doc was deep in the 
problem. He didn’t even look up 
as I closed the door behind me. 
And through the supposedly 
sound-proofed panels I could dis- 
tinctly hear him whistling. My 
Mother Was a Test-tube, My fa- 
ther Was a Wrench. Doc was hap- 
py in his work. 

Three hours later he came out 
of his inner sanctum, sweat in 
beads on his brow despite the air- 
conditioning. “Whew! That was 
a hard one. Your added charac- 
teristics from that fellow in the 
hospital did the trick. What a 
screwy metabolism! no chloro- 
plasts, no plug-ins, no A-convert- 
ers, only a simple food-oxidation 
system. And I had to keep reinte- 
grating the DNA; it kept trying to 



resume the normal shape instead 
of returning into the Original but 
I finally got it.” 

“You mean we have an Origi- 
nal? Alive? Already?” 

“Eh? Oh, sure, that’s what I’ve 
been telling you. Come into the 
back, Jan, come in.” He waved 
me in, followed, then pointed to 
the optical scope. Under it was 
now a small pseudouterus with 
Doc’s gleaming tools still wet by 
the side. “Look in there. Go 
ahead, look, it wouldn’t bite.” 

I saw a cell in the scope, or 
rather a small clump of cells. I 
don’t know much about embroy- 
ology but I would have certainly 
called it a beautiful blastula. As I 
watched, a couple of cells divided, 
their cytoplasm and tiny nuclei 
duplicating themselves in perfec- 
tion. 

I looked up smiling. “We did it! 
You did it! Is it within the stipu- 
lated genotype limits of the cli- 
ent?” 

“According to Mabel here the 
chances are that it is a 97+2% 
pure blood Original.” He slapped 
the computer affectionately. “And 
Mabel is never wrong. Because 
he’s our first born I made him a 
nice boy, Jan. Think of that, 
Jan,” he beamed. “We’re the par- 
ents of a beautiful unmutated Ter- 
ran Homo ... an Original, per- 
haps the first Original born in 
over two million years. Say, what 
species is he? Neo-originalis?’*

“Why not sentiens,” 1 asked af- 
ter a moment of thought to recall 
my neoathenian. 

“Right you are!” Doc got out 
some old brandy, Algol V 4501 
vintage. “Here’s to our son,” he 
toasted. "'‘Homo sentiensT 

A MAIL ship of the Empire car- 
ried us from Raega to Deneb 
II, past Sertain and Wolff, and 
then to the silver towers of Gro- 
match’s old port. There I booked 
passage on the tramp trader Dip- 
per Lass, which carried us through 
the Scorpion Cluster and down 
King Ampteps’ belt, with stops to 
see the Golden Islands of Twilight 
on Ran III and the Emerald Hills 
of Tobaris. On Novecentaurs we 
boarded a regular Rim-bound lin- 
er which eventually brought us to 
the free port of Sastral on Harn- 
lock VI, ten parsecs from Tara of 
the Red Suns. President Zarkos’s 
launch was waiting there for us. 
I had ‘grammed ahead the date of 
our arrival. 

We followed a zigzag course 
across the Galaxy, that child and 
I, he down in his freeze c^lse in the 
hold and me in first class when 
there was such. Around Tarsus I 
woke him up and introduced him 
to the universe. A fine lad he was, 
aged by biostim to a healthy fif- 
teen cycles and with a good quick 
intelligence. Finally we arrived on 
Tara. 

I won my bet; Zarkos could fly. 



and flying he and his retainers 
came down from their castled 
peaks to meet us at the main port 
of Tara, the three red suns high in 
the sky glistening off their silvered 
wings done in the latest fashion. 

“Marvelous, marvelous,” he 
said, his eyes widening as he saw 
my companion. “I never really al- 
lowed myself to believe that you 
could do it. But here he is. An 
Original. The only Original, and 
he’s all mine.” 

“I’m happy that you’re pleased, 
my lord,” I said, against the crisp 
breeze coming in from the green 
ocean beyond the port’s southern 
border. 

“Pleased? I’m overwhelmed! 
Here, the rest of your pay,” he 
handed me a credacard for the 
sum and I handed the lad over to 
two of his servants. 

“Goodbye, Gentlehom denJan, 
and many thanks.” Zarkos 
flapped his wings a few times to 
get up speed and then strode off 
into the air. 

“Goodbye, Papa Jan,” said the 
boy, his five yellow eyes misty 
with tears. The servants positioned 
themselves on either side of him 
and they rose in unison, the lad 
waving his tentacle at me. 
“Thanks for everything.” 

I watched them for a few min- 
utes, hypnotized by the beauty of 
their soaring forms. So that was 
what we all were, way back when. 
Why, he could fly better than they

could! 

I T was just after lunch, 14 De- 
kember 4515 that the second 
man came into the shop. He was a 
squat one, half a meter tall and six 
wide, with twelve thick feet, two 
thicker arms and a brillant metal- 
lic toga wrapped around his bulk 
like a shaggy red skin. 

“May I help you, sir?” 

“Yeth,” he said with an inter- 
esting accent. “I understhanth 
that you hath procured an Origi- 
nal for the thzoo of Prethidend 
Thzarkos of Thara?” He waited a 



minute, unsure of himself. 

“And ...” I interjected. 

“I ... I altho hath a thzoo . .” 

“I see.” 

So I called Doc. This one will 
be a girl, and a pretty thing too, 
all blue and green and with four 
bright golden wings like her 
brother. A full-blooded 97 + 2% 
unmutated Terran Original little 
girl. How happy they must have 
been, way back when. They are so 
beautiful. 

And I am so ugly. 

Ah, well. That’s life for you. ★

Men were for the Mother Sections — 
except for the untamed Wild Ones. 

ALFRED COPPEL 



T he Teacher’s voice droned 
on in the stuffy room. Jere, 
weary from a six hour patrol, 
could scarcely stay awake. Her 
head bobbed and Ella jabbed an 
elbow into her ribs. “Keep your 
eyes open,” Ella whispered. 

Jere straightened with an effort 
and squared her shoulders. A 
weight of weariness was pressing 



down on her and she had the re- 
bellious thought that patrolling 
wasn’t fit work for a woman. Ella 
was looking disapprovingly at her, 
lips compressed. Jere squirmed 
uncomfortably, more conscious of 
the hard bench and the glaring 
light than of the Teacher’s endless 
repetitions. 

At least, Jere thought, she 



73 






might try to make it interesting. 

But the Teacher, a major, was 
grinding out the same line, the les- 
son that never changed. If Jere 
had heard it once, she had heard 
it a thousand times. 

All right, she thought sulkily, I 
believe it. It’s all true. So what? 

The major was saying that San 
Francisco was entitled to free ac- 
cess to natural resources: oil, met- 
als, men — whatever was left. And 
that was the reason for the war. 
It seemed to Jere that the Three- 
Cornered War had been going on 
ever since she could remember. 
When it wasn’t against Los Ange- 
les and Denver, it was against 
Phoenix and, say, Seattle. There 
simply was not enough of any- 
thing left to go around — particu- 
larly men. 

At 2100 hours the class ended 
and the Scouts filed out of the 
classroom stiffly, aching from two 
hours on those hard benches. 

From the window of the small 
room she shared with Ella and two 
other girls of her section, Jere 
could see the bomb-shattered city 
spread out below. There were few 
lights, but the rubble was bathed 
in cold moonlight. To the north 
were the towers that the older 
women claimed once supported a 
bridge across the narrow mouth of 
the bay. In the west, the ruins of 
what had once been Oakland 
glowed with an eerie radioactive 
incandascence. 



“Bomber’s moon tonight,” Ella 
said uneasily. 

* “Denver has no planes,” Jere 
replied, slipping off her uniform 
blouse. 

“They have missiles,” Ella de- 
clared. “While you were flying, a 
dud landed in the bay.” She 
sniffed scornfully. “Interception 
was terrible.” 

“Interception generally is.” Jere 
lay gratefully on her hard cot and 
closed her eyes. But Ella stood at 
the window, contemplating the 
moonlight. “Jere,” she said. “Did 
you hear about the men?” 

TERE opened her eyes. “Which 
J men?” 

“The ones Captain Moira’s raid 
captured yesterday.” 

“How many?” 

“Eighteen, I think.” 

Jere whistled softly. “Denvers?” 

“No. Angelinas.” 

“That will bring a reprisal, all 
right. Those Los Angeles bitches 
won’t lose eighteen men without a 
fight.” She pursed her lips, star- 
ing at the ceiling. “Where are they 
now?” 

Ella shrugged. “In the breeder 
pens.” She gave a short, bitter- 
sounding laugh. “We won’t get 
any.” 

“Men aren’t for the Fighting 
Sections, Ella,” Jere said gently. 

“Why aren’t they?” Ella de- 
manded. “We do all the work, 
take all the risks.”

IF 




“Men are for the Mother Sec- 
tions, Ella,” Jere said. “It’s al- 
ways been that way.” And then, 
because she could see that Ella 
was unplacated by her answer, she 
added: “Pen-men are no good 
anyway. You’ve seen them.” 

Ella sat down on her cot and 
kicked off her flight boots. “What 
would you know about it?” 

“Nothing,” Jere admitted. “But 
I know some Mother Section peo- 
ple who’ve had wild ones. They 
say they are much handsomer.” 

“Savages,” Ella said. “Some of 
them can’t even be tamed. They 
have to be killed. Pen men are 
better.” 

“Maybe.” Jere stretched and 
closed her eyes again. Once, when 
she was still a young girl, she re- 
membered that she had had 
dreams about a world in which 
there was a man for each woman 
— a strange sort of world without 
ruins or missiles or Three-Cor- 
nered War. It had been pleasant 
to dream like that, but she had 
told someone — she couldn’t re- 
member now who — and Psych 
Section had taken her into analy- 
sis and explained the dreams 
away. It was always dangerous, 
they told her, to dream like that. 
Such ideas, even in sleep, endan- 
gered the Matriarchy. For three 
months she had gone to sleep with 
a somnoteacher whispering to her. 
The dreams had never came back, 
though she remembered them. , 



T he undulating wail of the at- 
tack alarm interrupted her 
drowsing reverie. A harsh voice 
crackled from the wall speaker. 

‘‘Radarplot has picked up jet- 
crajt a hundred miles south of the 
city. All Interception Section pi- 
lots man their planes. All Scout 
Section pilots stand by to assist. 
Mother Sections to shelter.'* 

“So Denver has no planes,” El- 
la said breathlessly, pulling on her 
boots. 

“Angelinas, dear,” Jere said, 
getting to her feet. “They have 
Beenine Ones. Damn them, any- 
way.” 

In the far distance the flak guns 
began their usual futile hacking at 
the sky. The whine of jets warm- 
ing and milling about on the flight 
decks filled the city. 

Ella and Jere ran down the cor- 
ridors crowded with women to- 
ward the hangar deck. From the 
Mother Section areas, a great sob- 
bing and shrieking filled the 
building with noise. Far under- 
ground, the precious men were 
herded into deep shelters. 

On the hangar deck there was 
some measure of order. Intercep- 
tors were being trundled out to the 
flight deck and a few ground-to- 
air missiles were being readied. 
The two-seat scout craft were 
being refueled and armed. 

Jere found her own ship near 
the end of the line. Her radar op- 
erator, a thin-faced girl with dark 



FOR SACRED SAN FRANCIS

stringy hair showing beneath her 
helmet, was standing by. 

“Are we fueled. May?” Jere 
asked, struggling into her flight 
gear. 

“They haven’t fixed the tail 
gun,” May said unhappily. “Is it 
the Angelinas, Miss Jere? Oh, 
Mother! I was afraid it would be 
them ever since I heard about the 
men. Those Angelinas really fight, 
they do.” 

“We’ll do all right. May,” Jere 
said with an assurance she did not 
really feel. She was thinking about 
the multiple pom-pom guns on the 
Beenine Ones. “Those airplanes 
are old as the hills.” 

May cast a doubting eye at the 
scarred flank of their own ma- 
chine. “So are ours,” she said 
sourly. 

T he steady firing of the flak 
guns ceased as the first flight 
of interceptors took the air. The 
silence was thick. Then the thin, 
whispering noise of the Beenine 
Ones came down on the waiting 
city. Jere estimated there were at 
least five of them. 

“Why are we always fighting. 
Miss Jere?” May demanded sud- 
denly. “Bombing and stealing and 
fighting all the time — ” 

“I’m sorry. Miss Jere,” May 
said. “I didn’t mean to talk like 
that. I’m nervous, I guess — ” 

“All right,” Jere said. “We 



both know better than to ask 
questions like that. Thank the 
Mother there wasn’t anyone from 
Security Section to hear you or 
I’d be riding without radar to- 
night. Let’s forget it.” 

“Thank you. Miss Jere,” May 
said heavily. 

** Scout Section aircraft stand 
by to support interception.*' The 
words of the Flight Controller 
came from the wall speakers, cut- 
ting through the clanger of the 
hangar deck. 

“Interception flubbed it again,” 
May said bitterly. 

As though to accent her words, 
there came the sound of explo- 
sions in the distance. 

“Along the Embarcadere,” Jere 
said. “Damn them!” 

** Blue Scout Section scramble!" 
the speaker shrieked. 

This is a bad one, Jere thought. 
The Angelinas were really seeth- 
ing tonight. 

“We’ll be next. May,” Jere 
said. “We can’t wait for the gun. 
Get aboard.” 

S ITTING in the vibrating jet, 
she could see Ella’s red-winged 
craft moving into the catapult. 
There was a Jet of steam, glowing 
blue-white from the engine, and 
then Ella was gone, climbing into 
the night. 

Overhead a fission bomb flared, 
sun-bright at seventy thousand 
feet. It etched the city in light.

blotting out the moon. 

Jere wondered how many fission 
bombs the attackers were carry- 
ing, and whether they were new 
bombs or weapons found in some 
ancient stockpile. 

Her practiced eyes flicked over 
the battered instrument panel. 
The turbine was vibrating badly 
but there was not a machine shop 
in San Francisco capable of re- 
pairing it to original specifications 
and the motor itself was nearly a 
hundred years old. It dated from 
the time before the Three-Cor- 
nered War, a time when there 
were still men who could fly and 
work and fight. The old women 
said they did not fight other cities 
in those days; . Jere wondered if 
such a time had ever really been. 
The Teachers said the Matriarchy 
had always existed. Yet the legend 
was that once there had been as 
many men as women and that 
the men had been the rulers. It 
seemed impossible. Those soft- 
fleshed breeders? The old women 
claimed it was so, swore it by the 
Mother. They told of a greater 
war that had decimated the male 
population until there were so few 
that women had to fight for them. 
Breed or die. The cause — 

We fight, all right, Jere thought 
bitterly. We fight for a handful of 
men, even though half of them are 
sterile or breed monsters and have 
to be destroyed. We fight for a 
puddle of uncontaminated water. 



a pile of hard coal, a half-ruined 
factory or a barren field. 

Red Flight scrambler 
The command drove the rebelli- 
ous thoughts from her mind and 
she rolled the jet forward toward 
the gaping mouth of the hangar 
and the catapult. Her lips moved 
silently in the short prayer she had 
used before battle since girlhood. 

Mother, protect your daughter 
Jere, defend our city, give us vie- 
tory and fertility and unmarked 
young — 

A S she emerged onto the cata- 
^pult deck, Jere could see the 
waterfront burning. The sight 
brought a surge of hatred for the 
women in the bombers. 

The catapult crew was signal- 
ing for her to rev up. She throt- 
tled the uneven engine with a 
practiced hand. 

“Ready, May?” she asked into 
the intercom. 

The girl’s reply came back, 
scratchy and indistinct. “Ready, 
miss. I wish we had the gun, 
though; I really do.” 

“Don’t worry about it now,” 
Jere snapped. “How’s the radar?” 
“I have power, miss,” May 
said. 

The Red Flight leader was on 
the starboard catapult, now van- 
ishing down the deck, spitting 
sparks from her half-tuned engine. 
Jere saw her ship vanish below the 
level of the runway and dip into 
the canyons between buildings.

She held her breath until she saw 
the glowing jet-trail of the airplane 
clear of obstructions and climbing. 

The catapult officer, was waiting 
for Jere’s signal. The engine was 
not developing full power, but Jere 
gave the signal anyway. The jet 
picked up speed with a rush. The 
dim blue lights at the end of the 
runway hurtled under the sharply 
swept back wings and they were 
airborne, banking low over the 
burning Embarcadero and swing- 
ing out over the dark waters of 
the bay. 

Jere set the airplane into maxi- 
mum climb configuration and 
turned back over the city. 

“Any contact. May?” Jere 
asked. 

“I have them, miss. They’re at 
seventy thousand feet, heading 
two four five degrees. Probably 
making another bomb run.” 

That’s exactly what they’re do- 
ing, Jere thought. Trying to get 
the breeding houses and the men 
in the shelters. What they couldn’t 
keep, they would destroy if they 
could. 

A streak of fire fell out of the 
sky. An interceptor shot down. 
Jere felt the hot anger of battle. 
This world, she thought, this 
bleak world is my world. Maybe 
things were different once, but this 
is what it was like now. Women 
were born to fight, not dream — 

“Fly zero five one,” May said. 



J ERE swung the jet to the new 
heading, still climbing. The 
moonlight was taking on the pecu- 
liar crystal brilliance of high 
flight. The altimeter needle 
touched 50,000 feet. Contrails of 
ice streamed from the wingtips. 

“Change course to zero five 
five,” May said through the inter- 
phone. “I have four bogies.” 

Jere banked the jet until the 
gyro held steady on the new 
course. “Anything from IFF?” 
“Nothing, Miss Jere,” May’s 
voice said in the helmetphones. 
“We might just be the only ones 
up here except /Aem.” 

From the misty moonlit earth 
below, a trio of rocket trails came 
streaking up and past them. There 
was a fiery blast as a great bomber 
disintegrated above and ahead of 
their track. 

“Oh, Mother,” May said. 
“They actually hit something.” 
“That will shake them up,” 
Jere said with satisfaction. 

Pieces of the burning bomber 
spiraled down, spinning and flut- 
tering like a fiery rain. Jere zig- 
zagged the jet skillfully to avoid 
them. 

“We’re up with them, miss,” 
May said. “You can pick them up 
on your screen now — if you can 
get it working.” 

The tiny radarscope in Jere’s 
cockpit flicked on and the bomb- 
ers were there, three of them now.

etched in green light. Jere cen- 
tered them on the grid and armed 
the wing rockets. 

“Closing,” Jere reported. 

“I’ll be on the guns,” May said. 

The altimeter needle hovered 
near seventy thousand feet. The 
sky was black as pitch and the 
stars and moon glittered like jew- 
els. Ahead, Jere caught a glimpse 
of metal flanks and the bluish 
glow of the Beenine Ones’ Jets. 

Far, far below there was a sud- 
den fireball and a rising mush- 
room of flame. The bombers 
banked away toward the south. 

“That was a bad one,” May 
whispered in a choked voice. “Oh, 
that was really a bad one.” 

Mother damn them, damn 
them, Jere thought. We try to live 
and they come up here with their 
bombers and their raiding — 

S HE was thinking of the heavy 
women of the Mother Sections 
cowering in the shelters as she 
triggered the first salve of rockets, 
watching them burning out of the 
pods and rushing away and down. 

“Missed,” May reported. “Just 
to the right and low.” 

Jere closed further on the flee- 
ing bombers and armed her sec- 
ond salvo. There were flashes up 
ahead and the wobbly trail of 
tracers streaking past at unbeliev- 
able speeds. The pom-pom guns 
on the bombers searched for the 



pursuing jet. May had swung the 
turret around, forgetting about the 
useless tailgun. She was firing 
over Jere’s head at the dark 
shapes ahead. The cockpit was 
filled with the odor of cordite and 
the airframe vibrated to the heavy 
thudding of the 40mm guns. 

Jere centered in her grid the last 
bomber in the line ahead and 
pressed the trigger. Rockets raced 
out and vanished into the glow of 
the bomber’s engines. The Bee- 
nine One turned into a blob of 
oily fire and began to break up. A 
kill, Jere thought exultantly. 

“Parasite fighter, miss!” May 
shouted. 

A tiny jet had left the parent 
bomber and was somewhere be- 
hind them. Jere’s mouth went dry; 
she pulled the scout around in a 
tight turn. The wingtips stalled 
and she lost speed and altitude 
correcting. Small fireballs flashed 
past her cockpit. The parasite was 
closing in from behind and Jere 
knew she could not shake free. 

She felt suddenly very tired, her 
movements of the controls were 
leaden, hopeless. She heard the 
crash of metal tearing and the 
whine of pressure escaping from 
the cockpit. 

“Miss! Help me, Jere — I’m 
hit!” 

“May!” 

No reply. Jere shoved the nose 
of the airplane down into a slant-

ing dive. The parasite followed. 
An explosive shell burst on the 
wingtip. The jet buffeted and be- 
gan to spiral steeply. Mother, pro- 
tect your daughter J ere — ^ 

The cockpit was filled with 
smoke and wisps of flame. 

“May! Eject!” 

There was no reply. Jere cast off 
the shoulder harness and twisted 
around to look back. She saw 
nothing but fire. She braced 
against the back and fired the 
ejection seat. The sudden cold 
took her breath away. She was 
falling. She remembered the rib- 
bon chute streaming out. Then 
nothing. 

J ERE opened her eyes in bright 
sunlight. There was grass under 
her and for a time she didn’t real- 
ize what it was. She had never be- 
fore been out of the city except 
while flying. 

A man squatted by her side; a 
man unlike any Jere had ever 
seen. She thought — a wild one. 

He was burned dark from the 
sun and he was dressed in rough 
clothes made of animal skins. His 
face was black-bearded and across 
his bare shoulders rested a rifle of 
archaic design. 

“We heard the fight last night,” 
he said. 

Jere did not reply. Her hands 
touched the pockets of her flight 
suit. Nothing had been taken. The 
flight chart was still folded at her 
thigh, the packet of emergency 



rations was at her hip. The man 
had gathered up her parachute 
and rolled it into a pack. 

“You mama’s girls are really 
making a mess of things, you 
know,” the man said. 

Jere ignored that and sat up. 
“Where is this place.” 

“Near Saratoga.” 

“What’s Saratoga?” 

“It used to be a town. He 
shifted easily on his haunches. He 
was a young man and his move- 
ments had a wild thUig’s litheness. 

“How far from the city?” Jere 
asked. 

He smiled, showing sharp white 
teeth through the dark bush of his 
beard. “What city?” 

“San Francisco, of course,” 
Jere said, frowning. “Did you take 
me for an Angelina?” 

“You all look alike to me,” he 
said, amused. 

“How far?” Jere asked again. 
“Sixty miles maybe. Depends 
on how you go.” 

“Can you read a map?” Jere 
asked. 

The man laughed. “I think so.” 
Jere took the chart from her 
pocket. “Then show me.” 

The man moved nearer. He had 
a strange, wild smell. His finger 
tapped the open chart. “Here,” he 
said. “Here’s where we are. And 
here — ” He moved his finger to 
the west, to a spot in the moun- 
tains where one of the ancient 
roads crossed a stream. “Here is 
where we are going.”

Jere drew away. “I must get 
back,” she said. 

“Yes? Why?” 

Jere stood up and looked down 
at the still squatting man. What 
would this savage know about a 
woman’s duty? It would be useless 
to explain. 

The man said carelessly, “You 
can’t get back. There’s no way 
through the mines and the wire.” 

TERE said nothing. All the Fly- 
ci ing Section people knew the 
path through the defenses. The 
Teachers saw to that Pilots who 
crashed and survived needed^ to 
know. 

The man shook his head. 
“Women,” he said. “You’ve done 
a great job, you have. You’ve shut 
yourself up in the cities and with 
all the fighting you do, no one 
can get near enough to change 
things.” He stood up and looked 
appraisingly at Jere. “You fight 
mostly over men, don’t you?” 

“Men,” Jere said. “Not wild 
animals.” 

The man picked a blade of 
green grass and put it between his 
lips. “You may have something 
there,” he said. “But seems to me 
you’re missing a bet. There are 
men about, even if they are a bit 
on the woolly side. Men who would 
like to get things started again.” 

He showed his teeth in a sav- 
age kind of smile.

“Like the old days,” Jere said 
scornfully. 

“The old days weren’t so bad, 1 
hear tell,” the man said. “I know 
men didn’t do such a good job of 
running the world, but you wom- 
en.haven’t done even as well.” 

“We survive,” Jere said. 

“So do we,” the man said. 
“And our women are women. In 
the cities they tell you men are no 
good, don’t they?” 

Jere did not reply. 

“Sure they do. Because there 
aren’t enough to go around.” 

Jere said, “I don’t have to listen 
to this.” 

The man stood beside her. “The 
hell you don’t,” he said. 

Jere stared at him. 

“Because, little mama’s girl, 
you belong to me now. I found 
you.” 

Jere said incredulously, “You’re 
insane.” 

“I must be,” he said, showing 
his teeth again, “even to think 
about taking another city woman. 
You fighters are all devils to get 
along with, but I’ve done it before 
and I guess I can do it again.” 

“ ‘ — another city woman — ’?” 
Jere was too stunned to say more. 

“I have three wives. You’ll be 
the fourth. Two of them are from 
Phoenix. They were shot down

‘'Mother!'’ Jere backed away 
from him and turned to run, but 
he moved so swiftly that she hard- 
ly knew what struck her. There 
was a stinging pain across her face 
that brought the tears to her eyes

ney. HeJiad been hunting when 
he found her. 

She followed him in a daze, 
stumbling along over her on the 
ground. He went slowly. Out of 
concern for her? 

By nightfall they had arrived at 
the lower reaches of the stream. 
The water, to her surprise, was un- 
contaminated. She watched while 
he stripped and bathed — always 
with his rifle near at hand. “Now 
you,” he said. 

Jere bathed in the cold water 
while he sat on the bank looking 
at her. 

He shot a brace of small birds, 
a variety unknown to Jere, who 



had seen only the ugly seagull 
mutations that infested the city. 
She ate the sweet flesh as the 
sunlight faded from the sky. 

“You’re being a sensible girl,” 
he said approvingly. “There’s no 
use fighting the inevitable. You’ll 
like it, living free. No crazy wom- 
en trying to bomb you. No play- 
ing soldier. It’s a good life out 
here.” 

“Why don’t the men come back 
to the cities?” Jere asked, thinking 
of the strength it would give San 
Francisco to have a few men like 
this one in the pens. 

“Why, first off, there are the 
defenses. I suppose we could man- 
age them if we wanted to work all 
together. But mainly it’s because 
we don’t have many weapons and 
there aren’t very many of us.” He 
grinned at her in the firelight. 
“We wouldn’t take to being a 
natural resource much, though 1 
guess there’s worse ways to earn

sterile from the radiation, too. 
You know they’d never keep a 
sterile man alive in the cities.

Jere nodded slowly.

It was, of course, in the littoral life forms involved and you have a

picture of the littoral zones of the 
Cambrian period. The one and 
major problem is that we are like- 
ly to have a somewhat biased pic- 
ture of what the Cambrian life 
forms were — because the various 
inhabitants of the waters near the 
littoral zone do not fossilize equal- 
ly well. The chances that a clam- 
shell will fossilize are excellent — 
they are still reasonably good for 
a crab — but ihty are poor for a 
worm and negligible for a jellyfish. 

The situation reminds me of a 
walk along the shores of one of the 
many lakes in the vicinity of Ber- 
lin when I was a student. There 
were three of us, all budding nat- 
uralists, and we did not stay to- 
gether. I lingered in a swampy 
area to watch dragonflies and 
frogs. The others walked ahead. 
When we met again and discussed 
what we had seen, somebody over: 
hearing our conversation might 
easily have concluded that we had 
taken three different walks. I re- 
ported that a frog, disturbed by 
my approach, waited for an aver- 
age of a little less than a minute 
before it cautiously stuck its head 
out of the water again. One of my 
two companions described an es- 
pecially luxuriant specimen of 
Sagittaria sagittifolia (a water- 
loving plant with arrow-shaped 
leaves) and told that at this or that 
place forget-me-nots grew in such 
profusion that they looked like a 
blue lawn. The third recited a list 



of all the birds he had seen and 
all the bird-calls he had identified. 

What had been personal bias on 
that occasion is replaced by the 
bias of the fossil record when 
Cambrian life forms are under 
discussion. Open any book, pro- 
fessional or popularized, to the 
chapter on the Cambrian period 
and you see trilobites, trilobites 
and then some more trilobites. 
Wasn’t there any profusion of 
other life? 

T he name itself is actually 
the result of a mistake. 
Fossil trilobites had been found in 
various ancient rocks and learned 
men had called them concha tri- 
loba — the three-lobed clam. In 
appearance they looked somewhat 
like the so-called sow-bugs that 
scurry away when you pick up a 
flat stone. Some don’t run but 
curl up and it was soon noticed, 
once people started paying atten- 
tion to fossils, that there were 
curled-up trilobites. 

Did this mean they were in- 
sects? 

It has to be borne in mine that 
before 1800 the word “insect” had 
a much wider meaning than now. 
When Carolus Linnaeus (1707- 
1778), the great classifier of both 
plants and animals, came to the 
creatures with jointed appendages, 
he created the class Insecta. In 
1800 George Leopold Dagobert, 
Baron de Cuvier (1769-1832), to- 



86 



IF 




day known as the “father of pale- 
ontology,” decided that thi^ was 
too big a pigeonhole. He separ- 
ated the Crustacea (crabs of all 
kinds) into a separate class. One 
year later Jean Baptiste, Cheva- 
lier de Lamarck (1744-1829), des- 
ignated eight-legged Arachnida 
(spiders and scorpions) as still an- 
other class, restricting the term 
“insects” to six-legged beetles, 
flies, butterflies, dragon flies, etc. 
Today the group Linneaus called 
Insec ta is the phylum Arthropoda 
(joint-footed) with the classes 
Crustaceans (crabs). Arachnids 
(spiders). Myriapods (millipedes 
and centipedes) and the true In- 
sects. 

To go back to the question of 
whether the trilobites were “in- 
sects,” it has Just been explained 
that they could have been quite a 
number of different things if the 
word insect was used in the Lin- 
neaen sense. But at least one man, 
the British geologist Shaw, 
thought them to be true insects, 
namely caterpillars. The problem 
was that nobody knew whether 
they had legs or not. Shaw rea- 
soned that the legs, if any, must 
be preserved in the curled-up 
specimens. He secured a large 
number of them (nearly 3,500) 
^and sliced through each. There 
were a number of doubtful cases, 
but 270 specimens clearly showed 
legs. Shaw had just published his 
findings when better fossil speci- 



mens were exhumed that revealed 
clearly the presence of many pairs 
of legs. 

There could be no doubt any 
more that the trilobites had been 
anthropods. Since they had had 
more than three pairs of legs and 
had, as proved by other evidence, 
been water-living, certainly they 
had not been true insects. 

W HAT they were still is not 
easy to say, however. The 
trilobites became extinct early in 
earth’s history and living arthro- 
pods show no resemblance to 
them except a superficially similar 
shape, as in the case of the sow- 
bugs. There is just one exception. 
The horseshoe crab Limulus, just 
before hatching, has a faint trilo- 
bite aspect. It so happens that 
Limulus is a very old (and odd) 
creature that succeeded in surviv- 
ing through about half a dozen 
geological periods, so that a rela- 
tionship is at least possible. In 
spite of the name horseshoe crab, 
Limulus is an arachnid, related to 
the spiders. 

The simple fact is that the tri- 
lobites do not fit into any classifi- 
cation of living animals. The tri- 
lobite world was different, and the 
neatly separated classes of our 
time had yet to emerge. The trilo- 
bites combined characteristics of 
arachnids and crustaceans and — 
since the later insects must have 
had precursors in forms that were 



THE STORY OF OUR EARTH

not yet insects — even a few faint 
insectlike characteristics. In size 
the trilobites ranged from half- 
inch specimens to giants about a 
foot in length. Quite a number 
had remarkably large eyes. The 
guess is that this was an adapta- 
tion to muddy waters near river 
mouths rather than to a nocturnal 
existence. 

The question of what they ate, 
of course, is tied up with the ques- 
tion of what was around for them 
to eat. One likely victim, for which 
we have fossil evidence, was the 
annelid (segmented) worm. The 
common earthworm is the variety 
best known to landlubbers but 
other kinds still swarm in all the 
seas. The picture of trilobites, as 
numerous then as shrimps are 
now, burrowing in bottom mud to 
hunt burrowing worms appears as 
a kind of prelude to the conquest 
of the land. Hunter as well as 
hunted are both in a mixture of 
water and land; at one time one 
is going to try to escape into what 
is merely wet land and the other 
is going to follow. 

That trilobites did crawl around 
on land during the latter part of 
the Cambrian period was proved 
for the first time, to my knowl- 
edge, by the American paleontol- 
ogist Charles D. Walcott. He 
found them in the so-called Pots- 
dam sandstone — dating back to 
the Upper Cambrian period — of 
New York State and adjacent 



areas in Canada. He published 
his findings in 1912 {Smithsonian 
Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. 
57), ascribing the tracks to the 
trilobite genus Protichnites, for 
which he had counted a total of 
17 pairs of legs! 

Such a series of feet 
- would make varied and 
complex series of tracks 
that would differ in depth, 
definition and details of 
grouping with the varying 
degree of consistency and 
hardness of the surface. 

1 have fine trilobite trails 
made on the surface of 
sandy mud that show the 
imprint of a considerable 
portion of the legs. On a 
hard surface the animal 
touched only the extremi- 
ties of the legs, but on a 
muddy surface the terminal 
joint would sink in and 
other joints would leave an 
impression. 

So wrote Walcott. In 1918 he 
published another report titled 
Appendages of Trilobites (same 
publication, Vol. 67) in which he 
described trilobite tracks of a 
greater age. They came from Mid- 
dle Cambrian layers of the Colo- 
rado Grand Canyon region. 

T he trilobite tracks were 
comparatively easy but other 
Cambrian tracks from Canada, 
first described by Sir William 



88 



IF 




Logan, were a challenging puzzle. 

One sandstone slab from Bid- 
well’s Crossing (Essex County, 
New York) measures 30 feet in 
length and 10 feet in width, show- 
ing 25 tracks. Each is about 5 
inches wide, with a length up to 
15 feet. The tracks look like a 
miniature ladder with an oval im- 
pression measuring 5 by 15 inches 
at one end. The farmer, B.H. 
Palmer, who first noticed the fos- 
sil on his property, was convinced 
that the responsible creatures had 
been giant snakes and was dis- 
mayed because he could not find 
an explanation in his Bible. 

Well, they certainly were not 
snakes, but what were they? Sir 
William Logan had guessed the 
tracks might be those of large 
marine snails. Later scientists, 
after some hesitation, agreed. It 
must be mentioned that among 
the tracks that end in an oval im- 
pression can be found such im- 
pressions without a track to go 
with them. The accepted explana- 
tion is that a wave threw a num- 
ber of the large sea slugs on the 
shore. Some of them died imme- 
diately, leaving the oval impres- 
sion where their bodies had de- 
composed. The others crawled for 
some distance, but succumbed be- 
fore they reached the water. 

In any case, it has become clear 
that during the Cambrian period 
not only trilobites abounded but 
also annelid worms and large ma- 



rine slugs. In addition the remains 
of small crustaceans other than 
trilobites have been found, as well 
as impressions of jellyfish that ex- 
pired ashore. The existence of 
echinoderms (sea urchins, sea 
stars and sea lilies) is also proved, 
though fine fossils of these types 
are more frequent later — in Silur- 
ian and Devonian deposits. 

But except for short excursions 
by trilobites, no land-life yet. Ac- 
cording to the fossil record, the 
conquest of the land must have 
taken place after the Cambrian 
period. The handbooks are silent 
about the Ordovician period that 
immediately followed the Cam- 
brian. But things begin to take an 
interesting turn during the afore- 
said Silurian and Devonian per- 
iods, which followed the Ordivic- 
ian and had a combined duration 
of about 100~ million years. 

One event — without any influ- 
ence, incidentally, on the future of 
evolution — was the appearance of 
enormous water-living arachnids, 
the sea scorpions. Eurypterus, 
from Silurian deposits of the is- 
land of Oesel (now Saaremaa) in 
the Baltic is the oldest known. It 
grew to an overall length of 4 feet. 
The Devonian Pterygotus from the 
red sandstone of Scotland (the 
quarry workers, when they come 
across one, pass the word through 
the foreman that they found an- 
other “seraphim”) reached more 
than 7 feet in length. 



THE STORY OF OUR EARTH

'DUT another and far more im- 
-^-^portant event was the appear- 
ance of the first fishes, the earliest 
animals with backbones. These 
did indeed influence the course of 
evolution, and profoundly. 

Of course, they had to have an- 
cestors. And it so happens there 
is a living form that at least hints 
how those ancestors must have 
been constructed. The animal in 
question is about 4 inches long 
and looks so much like a slug that 
its first discoverer, the physician 
Peter Simon Pallas, believed it to 
be one. About sixty years after the 
discovery, that is to say around 
the year 1840, Johannes Muller 
recognized that it was related to 
the vertebrates and a few decades 
later the evolutionists made it fa- 
mous under the name of Amphi- 
oxus. As far as I know, no fossil 
relative of Amphioxus has been 
found even though one could have 
turned up anywhere in geological 
history aher the Cambrian. 

The most primitive fossil fish 
known is probably Birkenia from 
the Upper Silurian of Scotland. 
There early fishes were finless, ex- 
cept for a tailfin, as are the living 
lampreys. Interestingly enough 
Birkenia, again like the lampreys, 
shows eight round gill openings 
arranged in a straight line. 

By the time Birkenia was swim- 
ming around, other types of fishes 
had appeared. Most did not live 
beyond the Carboniferous period. 



The most unusual of these types, 
technically the Antiarchi, were 
fully armored with bony plates — 
one wonders against what con- 
temporaries. An important point 
is that the other ancient fishes 
were found in marine deposits 
while Birkenia comes from fresh- 
water deposits. By the end of the 
Silurian period the oceans prob- 
ably had grown salty, though to a 
lesser degree than they are now. 

If there was a differentiation be- 
tween saltwater and freshwater 
fishes one can easily assume there 
also was a differentiation between 
saltwater and freshwater plants. 
Somehow it seems likely that 
freshwater plants, rather than 
saltwater ones, invaded land. 
Freshwater varieties could climb 
a river’s banks, first partly ex- 
posed to the air and then wholly 
so except for the roots that re- 
mained in wet ground. 

We don’t have fossils of such 
plants. They probably rotted away 
completely after they died. But 
we do have fossils of a very early 
forest that grew in a river delta 
near the beginning of the Devon- 
ian period. The fossil trees turned 
up in the Catskills not far from 
New York City in 1930 and 1931 
when excavations for a dam cut 
into the old river deposits. The 
existence of definite land plants 
for the early Devonian is docu- 
mented by these finds. 

As for Devonian land animals 



90 



IF 




there is no documentation yet; a 
so-called three-toed footprint from 
the Devonian of Warren County, 
Pennsylvania, first described by 
Othniel C. Marsh in 1896, is a 
very doubtful case. It could be al- 
most anything, including the im- 
pact of a windblown piece of dead 
wood from a tree. 

The first animals to venture on 
land were probably arthropods, to 
be followed by some freshwater 
fishes. Even now there are several 
kinds of fishes that come out of 
the water of their own volition. A 
much publicized recent example is 
the “walking catfish” that infests 
some areas of Florida. 

A strange track, consisting of 
two parallel lines of straight im- 
pressions, is known from Nova 
Scotia. The description by H. M. 
Ami (published in 1903 in Hali- 
fax) concluded: “They were evi- 
dently made by some f\n or spine- 
like appendage attached to the 
body of the organism, which may 
have been that of an acanthodian 
or other early form of fish existing 
in the early Devonian lake, sea or 
estuaries of Nova Scotia.” 

The Devonian period, then, is 
the time when the land was in- 
vaded by living things which, how- 
ever, still stayed close to water

THE STORY OF OUR EARTH 



91 




In rapid seiVice shorthand I 
voced the figures scrawled on my 
pad into a detailed report for Lin- 
coins exec. Detailed, maybe, is 
the wrong word. We had no in- 
struments aboard the alien ship. 
There was nothing to see in the 
dimly lit lock. And feelings are 
something you can’t transmit in 
the pulses of sub-voc code. 

We had all sensed part of it 
when the jarring clang of alarms 
had brought us to Lincolns 
bridge. The feeling had been 
there when the dark shape had 
blotted out Alpha Centauri. Beth 
Rainer had moved close to' me, 
had touched my arm. We had 
stared a long moment at the gold- 
en spiral circled in black on the 
alien hull — a great, blazing galaxy 
hinting at unknown empires. 

Beth, her eyes held by the dark 
ship, had said, “Jake — Jake, I’m 
cold.’’ 

And she had said all there really 
was to say. 

“Lieutenant?’’ 

Grier was above me. Grange 
stood back near the far wall. 

"'‘Lincoln get all that, Jake?’’ 

I nodded. “Tom acknowledged 
— I’m keeping open so he can 
monitor. We’ll have to give him 
what visual he gets. They’re let- 
ting sound out but there are still no 
pictures.’’ 

Grier frowned. “Figures. I’d do 
the same if they were on Lincoln. 
Keep the visitors busy enough so 



nobody gets nervous — but don’t 
get careless.’’ 

He eased himself down on the 
lock’s deck and leaned against the 
smooth wall. 

I sent a short, quick sub-voc to 
Lincoln: Tom — nothing doing yet. 
We wait. 

Sharp lines of tension etched 
Grier’s face. Strained patches of 
white limned Johnny’s mouth. 
And similar signs on me, I was 
sure. As the captain had suggested, 
the aliens’ delay might or might 
not be a bit of practical psychol- 
ogy. Whatever it was — it worked. 
Seconds have a way of becoming 
hours when imagination is the 
most solid reference point around. 

We were invited — affirmative. 
That open port and steady blink 
had been plain enough. But an 
invitation’s no guarantee of how 
the party’s going to work out. The 
old unknown, then. A simple 
enough challenge. How could we 
resist? 

“Okay — easy does it.” 

I followed Grier’s eyes to the 
far wall. A wide port whispered 
aside where no port had been be- 
fore. 

Grange gave a low whistle. I 
could see his point. It looked as if 
we’d stumbled into the alien 
equivalent of the Royal Barge. I 
glanced at Grier. He was viewing 
the whole scene with a cold eye. 

The corridor stretched thirty 
feet from the open port. The walls 



BY CIVILIZEDSTANDARDS 



93 




on either side were sculptured in 
a dark, polished wood — alien pat- 
terns intertwined in complex de- 
tail to meet in a vaulted ceiling 
over our heads. 

The floor was carpeted in muted 
tones of mottled gold. It resem- 
bled nothing I could remember 
seeing before, still — I kneeled for 
a closer look and the hackles 
climbed the back of my neck. I 
had forgotten I was aboard a ship 
that stopped at unknown ports 
among the stars, places where 
beasts with pelts that size might 

“Jake,” Grier asked, “are your 
eyes any better than mine? One 
Christmas tree bulb would flood 
this place with brilliance. Is that 
supposed to be another door down 
there or just more decoration?” 

I squinted. The corridor seemed 
to end in the same sculptured 
wood as the walls. The dim amber 
light would obscure any indenta- 
tion farther than a few feet away. 

Grier let out a breath. 

“Okay. Let’s get on with it.” 

He turned away quickly but I 
caught a hint of something behind 
his steady gaze. His alertness was 
not too hard to figure — we were 
all very much aware of the fiction 
of our open line to Lincoln. The 
contact was comforting unless you 
thought too much about it — how 
it was as tenuous and as easily cut 
as a strand of thread. 

Earth is new in space, a child 



at the edge of its crib. Lincoln 
III was the first ship to break the 
bounds and venture into the dark 
beyond Pluto. We had no miscon- 
ceptions about the alien ship that 
darked Lincoln. Wherever it came 
from, it had not been confined by 
the slow velocity of light — it had 
eaten the years between the stars. 

W E STOPPED a few feet from 
the sculptured walls that 
marked the corridor’s end. 

“I’m fighting an irresistible 
urge,” I told Johnny Grange, “to 
turn around and see if that door 
behind us is still open. I’ll be 
damned if I’ll give in to it.” 

Grier scowled at me. 

“Don’t,” he said simply. 

He laid a hand on the smooth 
wood, running his fingers along 
polished curves, pressing the sur- 
face at several likely-looking 
points. I gave him a hand, leaning 
into the wall and testing it with 
various random pressures. 

“They’ve got their own way of 
doing things, skipper,” I said. 
“Maybe it’s the old Oriental pa- 
tience bit.” 

Grange shook his head. 

“It’s the sophomore psych bit, 
Jake. And why not? Works, 
doesn’t it?” 

“I wonder,” I said aloud with- 
out quite meaning to, “if we’d be 
so anxious to get in if we knew 
what was on the other side.” 

The captain grinned. 



94 



IF 




“Glad you’re with us, Jake. 
You’ve brightened an otherwise 
dull day.” 

“Captain — ” 

Grier and I jerked around. 
Johnny was standing back, watch- 
ing a thin black line form on the 
polished wall. It parted. Panels 
slid silently aside. 

I COULD try. I could say eyes 
widened, hearts fell into stom- 
achs. Won’t do. Take a culture, 
let it stew a couple of million 
years, get born into that culture 
and grow up in its pattern. Now 
go out and climb inside an alien 
ship and walk into a room where 
everything took a different direc- 
tion. That same number of mil- 
lions of years ago. Your heart 
beats a little faster — but you don’t 
react as you thought you would. 
You can’t, because you need 
something to react to — and it sim- 
ply isn’t there. Not in the room 
that really was not a room at all 
and certainly not in the alien faces 
and forms. 

They were seven — standing to- 
gether in a close huddle. Watching 
us from big, shining eyes like deer 
caught in headlights. They were 
human — or near enough — so close 
that the difference only magnified 
how far away they really were. 

They all stood over six feet, 
slender, almost no shoulders. Pale 
skin over sparsely covered skulls, 
wide cheeks, narrow nostrils. 



Mouths were bloodless scars. And 
unsmiling. 

One of the tallest stepped for- 
ward, stopping a good fifteen feet 
away. His voice was high, steadily 
pitched. 

\Emora Sourain — .. 

Grier glanced at me out of the 
side of his vision and pointed to 
himself. 

“Nathan Grier,” he said, then 
pointed to the alien. “Emora 
Sourain.” 

The tall alien shrank back. He 
spoke rapidly to his friends and 
they stared at Grier with pure 
loathing. 

Grier’s face was chiseled in 
tone. He pulled Johnny and me 
together. ^ 

“What happened? If it wasn’t 
his name, it should mean person, 
human, friend — something.” He 
cursed silently. “How does he fig- 
ure I gave the wrong answer, 
Jake?” 

1 shrugged. I had been glancing 
around the room, vocing quick de- 
scriptions back to Lincoln. The 
deal was anything but easy. A ma- 
roon beam extended from one side 
of the room to the other, eight 
feet off the floor. A gray, pancake- 
sized object veined with copper- 
colored stripes hung from the ceil- 
ing by a thin wire. 

“Captain, take a look around. 
Maybe that’s your answer. We 
aren’t even on the same wave 
length. It * doesn’t figure that

there’s nothing here that looks like 
anything we’ve ever seen before. 
They’ve got two arms, two legs 
and a head. They could use nearly 
anything on Lincoln as well as we 
could — so where are the chairs and 
tables?” 

“I know,” said Grier stonily. “I 
don’t like it.” 

I glanced back at the huddle. 
The head man stepped forward 
again — no, he only looked like the 
head man. He was older, his eyes 
sunk deeper into his nearly hair- 
less skull. His gaze wandered 
across all our faces and back 
again but it always stopped at 
Grier. 

“Jake,” said the captain, “give 
me your pad and pencil. We 
should have thought of this in the 
first place.” 

I handed him the items and he 
began to fill the page with sym- 
bols. He drew a planetary system 
around a star, a geometric bisec- 
tion, an angle, addition in simple 
domino fashion — the whole works. 
He tore off the sheet and handed 
it to the alien. 

The elder peered at the paper 
in Grier’s hand, then squinted sus- 
piciously at Grier himself. Finally 
he reached out cautiously and 
grabbed the paper quickly. 

You could chew the tension. He 
held the paper close to his face, 
stared at it, turned it over and 
studied the blank backside. Then 
he glared at us and dropped it to 



the floor. We watched it flutter 
away hopelessly. 

Grier swallowed hard. “So much 
for science. What in — now what’s 
he doing?” 

The alien had plunged a hand 
inside the folds of his clothing and 
pulled out a dark object. He 
clutched it tightly until the veins 
stood out and throbbed on his arm. 
He moved cautiously toward us. 
The head man broke from the 
group and grabbed the elder’s fist. 

""Yutevaan' he said. His voice 
held a strained, pleading note. 

'‘Yutevaarni ci/' 

The elder went livid with anger. 
His face reddened to blackness 
under the amber light. 

he spat out, flinging 
the other’s hand away. ""Rywai ti 
ci,"' 

The first alien trembled and 
shrank back. The elder composed 
himself, stepped right up to Grier 
and extended his hand. He opened 
the thin fist slowly. 

“Coro/mr/.” 

We looked. It was a crescent- 
shaped piece of stone that might 
have come from a river or stream 
anywhere on Earth. Just a plain 
piece of stone — black, with chips 
of gray. 

“Coro/mr/.” 

There was a certain plea for 
understanding in his eyes but his 
voice remained haughty, demand- 
ing. 

1 could hear the wheels turning

IF 




in Griet’s head. He could run into 
trouble any way he went. If he 
kept quiet they might very well 
chop us on the spot. But any re- 
sponse at all had an even better 
chance of bringing on the same 
action. He did the only thing he 
could — he kept his mouth shut and 
stood perfectly still. 

The alien closed his fist slowly, 
put the object carefully back into 
his clothing and kept his eyes 
locked on Grier. The tendons in 
his face tightened and his thin nos- 
trils clamped in upon themselves, 
“K/W/,”he spat, 

He jerked around and stalked 
back to his group. 

I let out a deep breath. 

“Anyone want a loose transla- 
tion of yildP."' 

“No,” said the captain grimly, 
“I got that one.” He glanced 
quickly at the aliens, then back at 
me. “Jake, is Tom still with us? 
Check. I want an acknowledge- 
ment.” 

I TRIED. Tom blinked back im- 
mediately. Grier fingered the 
voc on my belt, quickly instructed 
Buddington to run all our tapes 
through to the Beagle Beacon — 
and gave the ominous orders to set 
the Beagle for an Alpha Centauri 
orbit and keep his finger on the 
button. 

When he finished his face was 
hard, ashen gray. He had let his 
exec know there was a good 



chance the Beagle was all that 
would ever leave the Lincoln. 

“All right,” he said. “‘I think we 
have maybe three minutes to find 
a way to get through to these 
people. Let’s have ideas — quick.” 
“One more wrong idea,” I be- 
gan, “theirs or ours — ” 

Grier shook his head. 

“Doesn’t matter. There’s no 
question which way we go, is 
there, Jake? We have to connect. 
Speech is out. Group or self iden- 
tification isn’t what it ought to be. 
I’ll forget the business with the 
rock — no use wasting time on that 
one. What does that leave us?” 
“There’s something very wrong 
about our having messed up with 
the symbols,” said Grange. “Peo- 
ple who build spaceships know tri- 
angles and squares and — ” 

“Damn it.” Grier jabbed a fist 
into his hand. “They do know it, 
Johnny, but they’re looking for 
something they figure is more 
basic than that — something we 
haven’t even considered, some- 
thing — ” 

“Something,” broke in Grange, 
“that they understand and we rec- 
ognize they understand.” 

Grier stared at him. He opened 
his mouth, then shook his head 
and grabbed my pad and pencil. 
He sketched for a moment at a 
furious pace, then tore x)ff the 
sheet and passed it to Grange. 

“That meet your qualifications, 
Johnny? Something they under- 



BY CIVILIZED STANDARDS 



97 




stand and something we know 
they’re very much aware of.” 

Johnny held out the paper. It 
was a neat copy of the big galactic 
spiral circled in black on the hull 
of the alien ship. I felt a vast sense 
of relief. I could see the same feel- 
ing reflected in Johnny’s eyes. 

“Now,” said Grier, “is it right? 
Exactly right? Jake, check with 
Tom — he can see the thing. We 
can’t afford to go second class any- 
more.” 

Tom, Beth and several others 
joined in describing the symbol in 
minute detail. According to them 
we were as close as we could be 
without an actual photo of the 
emblem. 

Grier took a deep breath and 
stepped forward. The aliens 
dropped into dead silence. Then 
the elder raised his arm and 
pointed to the paper, then low- 
ered it until his long finger 
pointed directly at the floor be- 
tween them. 

The implication was all too 
clear. The muscles tightened vis- 
ibly along the captain’s back but 
he carefully placed his drawing on 
the floor and stepped away from 
it. 

The elder moved forward, 
picked it up without taking his 
eyes from us. Finally he brought 
it to his face and looked. He gave 
a sudden, sharp gasp and stared at 
Grier. He jerked around quickly, 
flinging his robes wide and thrust- 



ing the paper high above his com- 
panions’ heads. 

'Zarakrindi!*' he shouted. 

The alien huddle moaned. 

"^ZarakrindiV' he repeated, 
pointing with a trembling finger 
at the drawing. 

Eager hands grasped for the 
paper. It passed quickly through 
the group. 

The elder stepped forward 
again and faced Grier. His arms 
came up from his sides until two 
palms were held out openly before 
us. 

^"Zarakrindi"" he said. ""Ti yasu 
ci Zarakrindi." 

A wide grin spread across his 
tight features. 

I let out a deep breath. Johnny 
grabbed my arm. Sweat was stand- 
ing out in little beads on the cap- 
tain’s face but he was smiling.^ 

“Jake — what’s the word from 
Lincolnl You bring ’em up to 
date?” 

“Didn’t have to do much, sir,” 
I told him. “They got most of it — 
and they’re breathing a little eas- 
ier over there, too.” 

A dark wooden table and deli- 
cately contoured chairs appeared. 
Three aliens thrust glasses of cold, 
dark liquid into our hands. 

I glanced questioningly at Grier. 

“Drink it,” he said flatly. He 
looked at the aliens and smiled 
broadly. “If they didn’t probe our 
body chemistry in the lock, well — 
qheers.”

He turned up the glass and 
drained it. 

I closed my eyes and poured the 
drink down quickly. It was cool, 
pungent, a dusty wine with a slight 
breath of some unworldly spice. 
The aliens nodded happily and 
downed drinks of their own. The 
elder offered me another glass and 
I reached out with a smile and 
froze. I could feel Grange tense 
beside me. 

Over the alien’s shoulder 1 
could see the head man entering 
the room from a port on the far 
wall. Beside him, walking with the 
bearing of a queen, was a woman. 

“Jake,” the Captain said dryly, 
“it appears we have more in com- 
mon than we thought.” 

I NODDED. No question about 
it — the girl would have turned 
eyes anywliere on Earth. I said 
the similarities between the two 
races only magnified our differ- 
ences — and the girl was no excep- 
tion. But her particular qualities 
magnified those differences in an 
entirely unexpected direction. The 
large dark eyes were compelling, 
exotic. Dark hair hung to her 
shoulders like thin strands of 
feathered silk and her narrow lips 
curved in a warm and secret smile. 
She was covered in a long, trans- 
parent sheath as delicate as a 
spider web and the body beneath 
was painted in a complex pattern 
of gold. 



She was covered in a long trans- 
us. The aliens bowed. We bowed 
back and the girl inclined her 
head. 

""Zarakrindi"' said the elder. He 
pointed to the tiny amulet around 
her neck. "'Zarakrindi.'" 

She wore a replica of the em- 
blem on the side of their ship, the 
drawing Captain Grier had drawn 
moments before. We smiled and 
nodded. The girl and the alien 
elder smiled and nodded back. 

“Now what?” Johnny asked. 

“Smile and nod, son,” Grier 
said out of the corner of his 
mouth, “smile and nod and drink 
your wine.” 

The elder looked at Grier and 
raised a thin brow. 

“T/ val ZarakrindiT' he asked. 

^^TivaPr 

He looked at Grier. Then at the 
girl. 

“Jake,” said Grier, “there’s not 
much doubt, is there?” 

“Nope,” I said and I could 
feel a small, unpleasant itch in the 
back of my head. “Whatever she 
is, she’s royalty of some kind — and 
I’ve got an idea they want to know 
if we’ve got one, too.” 

Grier’s eyes bored into mine for 
a long moment. 

“Captain — ” I began. 

“Lieutenant. Tell Buddington I 
want Beth Rainer over here in ten 
minutes — ten flat.” 

“Sir—” 

He shook his head.

“Sorry, Jake. I don’t like it 
either. We don’t have a hell of a 
big choice, do we? Tell Tom I 
want her dolled up like a queen — 
jewels, gown, the works — and if 
there’s any gold paint or powder 
sitting around in the shop, use it. 
And Jake — ” 

“Sir?” 

“Tell Buddington I mean now. 
We can’t nod and smile and down 
white lightning all night.” 

I didn’t like it. Not at all. Beth 
wasn’t a lot safer where she was if 
anything went wrong but I pre- 
ferred her on the Lincoln anyway. 

In eight minutes, I relayed the 
word to the captain that Beth was 
on her way. Half a second later an 
alien messenger brought the news 
to the elder. He smiled at Grier, 
pointed to the girl, then gestured 
in the direction of Lincoln. 

"'‘Val ti Zarakrindi,'" he said, “r/ 
val ci." 

The captain nodded. It was a 
safe gesture for now. We had 
guessed right. The aliens wanted 
female royalty and that they 
would definitely get. 

I had quickly briefed Beth on 
the image she was to convey. She 
knew exactly what to expect — 
well, all you could expect with- 
out actually being there. Budding- 
ton said her costume was some- 
thing else again and Beth snapped 
back that it was no way for a lady 
to appear in public — human or 
alien. 



“Beth — you okay?” 

She was only fifty yards from 
the ship. 

“Doing fine, Jake,” she said 
lightly. “What time do I come 
down the runway?” 

“The band’s warming up, honey 
— bulging eyeballs from two 

worlds are waiting for Breathless 
Beth and her — ” 

“Jake — ” I caught the slight 
break in her voice even over the 
sub-voc. 

“Jake — I’m flat scared out of 
my wits.” 

“It’s okay, Beth. Everything’s 
okay.” 

Seconds later she was in the lock 
and Grange met her with a courtly 
bow for the benefit of alien ob- 
servers. Then he signaled that ♦ 
Beth and he were starting down the 
sculptured corridor. 

T om was right. Even the 
aliens seemed to agree Beth’s 
costume was something else. She 
had pulled a coal-black bikini out 
of some hiding place — I had cer- 
tainly never seen it before — and 
fashioned a long silver cape out of 
the wardroom drapes. The drapes 
were held together at her neck by 
Buddington’s flashy diamond soli- 
taire, immediately under a bright 
sapphire choeker I had seen Beth 
wear the evening before we left 
Earth. Finally someone in the lab 
had done a neat — and quick — ^job 
of patterning her body with a fair-

IF 




ly intricate network of gold. 

We had ordered royalty and 
Beth Rainer was an authentic 
Space Queen. 

Grier bowed. 

“Gracious Queen Beth,” he said 
soberly, “if the boys at Johns 
Hopkins could only see you now.” 

Johnny and I kept straight and 
solemn faces. 

Beth inclined her head graceful- 

ly- 

“Knock if off. Mighty Captain 
of Space,” she told him, “or I’ll 
slug you right in the snoot.” 

1 shot a glance to our left. The 
aliens were taking in the Earth- 
man’s ritual with all ears. The girl 
could not keep her dark eyes off 
Beth. The elder smiled benevolent- 
ly but I knew Grier, Johnny, Beth 
and I had the same gnawing 
thought — what was going to hap- 
pen if someone suddenly realized 
we had not the faintest idea of 
what was going on? 

^^Zarakrindi/’ said the elder, 
‘Zarakrindi ti — " and the alien 
faction muttered agreement. 

He looked at us, then turned his 
eyes on the alien queen. 

'‘Dha ei” 

The girl faced Beth and bowed 
low. Beth glanced at Grier and 
Grier moved his eyes slightly 
downward. Beth returned the bow. 
The aliens approved. 

The alien girl turned away and 
laid her hand on the elder’s arm. 
He passed her along to a guide and 



the two moved solemnly through 
a portal in the far wall. 

The elder turned back to us. 

“/?/, bhenei, ti/* 

Alien bearers appeared with 
more wine and the elder began 
chattering with two companions. 
We were abruptly left to ourselves. 

“Okay,” Beth said shakily, 
“what was all that about?” 

I haven’t the slightest,” I said. 
“It’s been a kind of nervous pat- 
tern, Beth. Strictly by ear. We 
could have muffed the whole thing 
just as easily.” 

Beth nodded solemnly. 

“Do I go, too — now that the 
princess has taken off?” 

Grier shook his head. 

“I don’t think so. If they’d had 
it in mind I think we would have 
caught it. Sorry.” He smiled. “I’m 
afraid you’re a member of the act, 
Beth.” 

Beth shrugged. 

“Captain,” I said, “I hate to be 
a wet blanket but where do we go 
from here? Does everyone come 
over to our house for drinks? And 
after that — what?” 

“You named the game, Jake,” 
he said solemnly. “We play it by 
ear. Like you say, we got lucky. 
Now we have to hold on to it.” 
“The sooner we call this off and 
get back to Lincoln — ” Johnny 
started, then caught himself and 
shut up. 

Grier grinned at him tiredly. 
“You’re getting it now, Johnny.

All we have to do is figure out how 
to say goodbye.” 

We smiled. And nodded. And 
tried to keep our minds off the too 
obvious fact that those big shiny 
eyes had pretty fair sets of brains 
between them — or they couldn’t 
have launched a ship like this one. 
And they had to know we were 
very much aware of the spiral sym- 
bol on their hull — that we were in 
touch with our own ship and cap- 
able of throwing Beth into the act 
to cover something we didn’t un- 
derstand at all. 

It was not so easy to remember 
we were not dealing with familiar 
minds — that the same group that 
made no attempt to understand 
circles and squares fell for a 
phony Space Queen production. I 
think we knew it had worked only 
because they wanted very badly to 
have it work. Unless I was sadly 
mistaken, it was a little more than 
that. I was fairly sure they had just 
proven — to themselves, at least — 
the universality of their religion. 
And that, of course, is a pretty big 
plum for even aliens to pass up. 

J AKE — ” Beth touched my arm 
nervously and I looked past her 
at the alien group. They were 
muttering excitedly to themselves. 
The elder smiled, then turned away 
from us and bowed low toward the 
far wall. The others hurriedly took 
up the cue. 

The wall slid aside without a 



sound. The aliens raised their eyes 
and murmured softly. 

In the entranceway was an intri- 
cate sculpture of the galactic em- 
blem mounted on a circle of black. 
Two aliens we had not seen before 
wheeled it a few steps forward, 
then backed away. 

It was our first look at alien art. 
From a distance it seemed to be 
made of some pale, translucent 
material that glistened softly un- 
der the amber lights. The galactic 
center shot golden spiral arms 
twisting in complex curves to the 
edge of darkness — and each arm 
was intertwined with a thousand 
tiny strands weaving dizzy circles 
through the structure. The spiral 
itself and the space-black circle 
were covered with countless pin- 
points of gold. 

“Okay,” said Grier softly. 
“We’re still on familiar ground. 
Just take it slow and easy.” 
“Zara^r/>z^//,” said the elder. 

He solemnly indicated the gold- 
en emblem. He turned his head 
and nodded slightly. Two aliens 
appeared again from the far door 
with another wheeled black circle. 
It was exactly like the first. Only 
this one was blank. The sculpture 
was missing. 

I glanced quickly at Grier. He 
shrugged imperceptibly. Beth 
squeezed my arm tightly. Behind 
us Johnny whistled almost sound- 
lessly between his teeth. 

An ajien much younger than the 



102 



IF 




others stepped through the portal. 
He carried a long flat case of 
carved black wood in his arms. He 
held it carefully, almost reverent- 
ly. The elder faced him and ac- 
cepted the case. He returned the 
younger’s bow with a slight nod. 

Then he walked directly toward 
us and handed the case to Cap- 
tain Grier. 

H e gestured toward the 

empty black circle. 
""Zarakrindi ti ruri,"" he said. 
Tiny beads formed on Grier’s 
brow. He understood exactly what 
the elder had in mind and I 
shared his sudden, desperate sense 
of frustration. Everything we had 
done to buy precious seconds had 
driven us one step closer toward 
a final act where bluffs would not 
work. 

“All right,” he said finally, 
“we’ll have to give it a try, Jake. 
There’s nothing else for it, is 
there?” 

He spoke to me but his eyes 
never left the elder. His voice was 
deadly calm. 

“The box,” he said. “It’s fairly 
heavy. It probably holds tools of 
some kind, hopefully something 
I’ll recognize. Where the ma- 
terials are, I can’t guess.” 

“Captain,” predicted Johnny, 
“they’ll show up. They know 
damn well we didn’t lug art sup- 
plies over here.” 

The captain chuckled softly. 



Beth laid her hand on his arm and 
stepped forward after the elder. 
The elder looked pleased. 

Grier and Beth stopped a few 
feet from the far wall, between the 
blank circle and the golden spiral. 
Johnny and I moved up a few 
steps behind them. 

The sculpture seemed a less 
than hopeless design now, its 
twisting patterns not impossibly 
complex — but the touch of an 
alien hand was even more star- 
tlingly evident. 

The elder smiled softly and 
spoke to Grier in such muted 
tones only a whisper of his voice 
reached Johnny and me. Grier 
listened but his eyes never strayed 
from the golden spiral. 

Something bothered him, I 
knew. It was something I sensed, 
too. There was a raw, primitive, 
almost pagan aura about the spi- 
ral that started the hackles rising 
on the back of my neck. I felt I 
was on the brink of remembering 
something I didn’t really want to 
remember at all. 

And then, quite suddenly, both 
of us knew. Maybe seconds apart. 
It was all there. Something we 
had left behind us a thousand 
years ago had come from the stars 
to find us again. 

Then Grier moved. 

He jerked around swiftly and 
shoved Beth behind him. His 
palm struck out and chopped 
sharply against the elder’s throat. 



BY CIVILIZED STANDARDS 



103 




Beth sprawled between us. I 
dropped quickly to the right and 
rolled toward her. Grier crouched 
low, moving away from the fallen 
alien, the black box a short club 
in his hand. He crabbed quickly 
to the left to reach her and a green 
flicker of light flicked across the 
room and brushed once against 
his chest. He folded quietly into a 
motionless bundle. The long case 
slipped from his fingers, spilling a 
rain of yellow blades and razored 
curves and a thousand golden 
pins. 

I reached Beth, passed her, 
scooped up a sharp sliver, of gold 



and wondered if I had the second 
I needed to do her the last favor I 
could. A pencil of green brushed 
my arm and I heard Johnny 
Grange sigh and drop behind me. 

Beth’s pale fist was tight against 
her lips. Her eyes were locked in 
final fear on the space-black cir- 
cles. One that belonged to her and 
one that held the tortured curves 
and twisted strands that had been 
her golden sister from a million 
stars away. I moved, my hand 
flashing sharp and golden, and 
met her eyes for a quick second 
before green blinked in an alien 
hand and reached out to find me.

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



JEFF MALLORY awoke. The 
dawn was strange and misty. His 
war wound throbbed. He seemed 
to have fatigued and aged during 
the night, — even his clothes, busi- 
ness suit and shoes, shirt and tie. 




were worn, all but used up, and he 
needed a haircut. 

Dressed, he looked through his 
bedroom window. The good subur- 
ban neighborhood was unkempt 
this morning. The neighbor s 
lawn featured cast-off junk. His 
own usually well-kept home 
showed neglect. 





He went down to breakfast. 

GILL, the woman he loved and 
had married, looked tired and slo- 
venly. The normally well-stocked 
cupboard was bare. The two 
younger children — MARLY and 
RANDY — were ruder than they 
usually were. The kitchen stank of 
garbage. And LORI, Jeffs teen- 
ager, was missing entirely. 



Gill explained, as she would to a 
child or a sick man. Jeff owned no 
business. She and he worked — as 
did everyone else they knew — at 
the Star Tower. She pointed at the 
Window. 

The mist outside had lifted. Jeff 
saw a huge tower in the distance, 
dominating the town. The struc- 
ture, several hundred feet in dia- 



She seemed to have been been 
erased. Gill denied that Lori had 
ever existed. The neighbors did 
not remember her. Her room in 
the house had vanished. Other 
pertinent bits of Jeffs life had 
melted away as if he had merely 
dreamed them— his burgeoning 
business, his plans for the future. 



meter, seemed to have grown 
there overnight but Gill behaved as 
if it had stood there forever. 

Becoming aware of an intruder 
— at once human and nonhuman — 
in the house, Jeff tried to fight. 
The intruder easily knocked him 
out and when Jeff came to. Gill 
was gone. Where and what was

reality? Jeff knocked a hole in a 
plaster wall where Lori's room 
used to be and found the room 
but no Lori. 

Outside — neighbors who had 
known Lori had no recollection of 
her. They all seemed enslaved by 
the alien masters of the Star Tow- 
er, remembered no other existence. 
Jeff encountered more of the 
aliens, fought them and managed 
to escape. His hunt for Lori took 
him to Sally Hodges, once Lori's 
friend — and at Sally's he encoun- 
tered a lawless group of refugees 
who believed that the country had 
been invaded by the Russians. 

Jeff was unable to convince 
them otherwise, finally had to flee 
for his life. Sally, although she 
thought he was suffering from de- 
lusions, accompanied him in a 
commandeered truck. They were 
captured by soldiers and taken to 
a U.S. — Russian military en- 
campment under the command of 
Colonel Strang. 

The encampment was isolated, 
self-contained. Both Strang and 
the Russians were convinced they 
were fighting Chinese Commu- 
nists and Jeff s theory of semi- 
human aliens failed to impress 
anyone. He and Sally separated. 
Then Jeff was forcibly ''drafted" 
into Strang's "army." 



T he barracks was a former cow 
barn, converted to troop use 
by the addition of a plywood floor 
and an assortment of beds rang- 
ing from antique four-posters to 
brand-new Sears, Roebuck cots. 
Men in uniform, both Russian and 
American, looked Mallory over 
as Brozhny condug^ed him to a 
stained and lumpy mattress on a 
makeshift frame at the far end of 
the long room. The odor of the 
former occupants was, if possible, 
stronger here than in the rest of 
the building. 

“What about the girl?” Mal- 
lory asked. “What’s Strang got in 
mind for her?” 

“Speak with more respect of the 
good colonel,” Brozhny said soft- 
ly. “Foryour own safety.” 

“Lieutenant, do you believe 
me?” 

“I’m sorry, no. I have no belief 
in walking department-store dum- 
mies who operate a factory — ” 
“But you believe in an invisible 
army of Chinese fanatics? Who 
suddenly learn enough space tech- 
nology to launch thousand-man 
transports high enough to make a 
deep-space approach and soft-land 
in the middle of the country? Who 
ignore military objectives to cap- 
ture a prairie town? Who consoli- 
date their victory by bunching up 
to make a perfect target — and then 
sit there and wait for Strang’s next 
move?” 

“There are many things about 
this curious war that puzzle me, 
Mr. Mallory. But I find your sto- 



108 



IF 




ry even more puzzling. Why 
should intelligent aliens behave in 
this way? Why were you alone im- 
mune to their control? Why have 
none of the rest of us seen such 
creatures?” 

‘‘Brozhny,” Mallory said ur- 
gently, “get me out of this Boy 
Scout camp. If I can find a clue 
to what’s going on, prove that Tm 
telling the truth — ” 

“Out of the question,” the Rus- 
sian said. “The colonel is right in 
one respect — we need every man.” 

“For what? To sit here on this 
broken-down farm and play sol- 
dier?” 

“We are gathering strength as a 
force, readying ourselves,” the 
Russian said. “When the time 
comes we will launch our counter- 
attack.” 

“You think an infantry mob 
can do what the whole Army and 
Air Force — U.S. and Russian — 
couldn’t do?” 

“As the colonel said — we have 
plans, Mr. Mallory. Be patient.” 

A lean, craggy-faced, big-fisted 
man in U.S. greens and a techni- 
cal sergeant’s chevrons strolled up, 
looked Mallory over. The new- 
comer’s lip lifted to show yellow 
horse teeth. Brozhny made brief 
introductions and left. The ser- 
geant propped his fists on his hips 
and squinted his eyes at Mallory. 

“You and the Russki are pals, 
hey?” He spat on the floor in the 
general direction of the door. 
“Well, the sweet talk is over. 
You’re in the Army now. I’m Ser- 
geant Gaunt. You work for me. 
First job for you is latrine detail.” 



“I’m not in the Army,” Mal- 
lory said. “I’m a civilian. 1 was 
brought here at gunpoint by my 
pal, the lieutenant — ” 

“Don’t talk back to me, boy!” 
The sergeant prodded Mallory’s 
chest with a finger as hard as a 
pistol barrel. “You’ve been called 
to the colors legal and proper.” 

“In that case I’m in the wrong 
place. I’m a reserve major. I’ll 
take my gold leaves now.” 

“Officer, eh?” Gaunt’s mouth 
curved in a V. “Any proof?” 

“I left my wallet in my other 
pants.” 

“Ain’t that too bad? Looks like 
you’re lying. I don’t like that. Pri- 
vate. I reckon you’lf be on latrine 
for a while.” He turned and 
roared a name. “Chubb!” A 
runty soldier with jug ears and cor- 
poral’s stripes hustled over. “Set 
him to digging slit trenches. See 
he digs ’em deep.” 

“Let’s go,” he said to Mallory. 
Chubb tipped his head, fin- 
gered his carbine. 

Mallory followed the noncom 
out into the cold wind and to a 
barn, there to be handed a long- 
handled spade. Then the noncom 
marched Mallory around behind 
the building to a rectangular 
screen of canvas strips mounted 
on poles. 

“You heard the man. Dig ’em 
deep.” 

Mallory fell to work, handling 
the shovel awkwardly. 

“What’s the matter with your 
arm?” Corporal Chubb asked. 

“I picked up a few splinters 
from an imaginary explosion.” 



SEEDS OF GONYL

Chubb grunted. Mallory dug. 
After an hour he had finished one 
trench — a foot wide, two feet deep, 
twelve feet long. 

“All right, that’s enough,” 
Chubb said. He was shivering, 
hands thrust deep in his pock- 
ets. “I reckon you can break for 
chow now. Sarge never said you 
couldn’t eat.” 

Chubb escorted him to a long 
tent from which steam and sour 
food odors emanated. In the can- 
vas-smelling gloom inside, he 
picked a greasy tray from a stack, 
joined the serving line. As he held 
out the tray, his eyes met those of 
the server. 

“Lori!” he said. 

S HE stared at him wide-eyed. 

The big ladle in her hand 
dropped unnoticed. 

Mallory leaned toward her and 
whispered swiftly, “Don’t let them 
know.” Then, in a normal voice, 
he said, “What a surprise to see 
you here.” 

Lori leaned toward him. Her 
lips moved. Tears filled her eyes. 
“How — when?” 

“I arrived a couple of hours 
ago,” he said. “Courtesy of Lieu- 
tenant Brozhny.” 

“I can’t believe it. I thought you 
were dead.” 

“I’m alive, all right — ” 

“Hey, you — the new guy. Move 
it along,” Corporal Chubb called. 

“Lori — I’ll see you in a few min- 
utes.” 

Chubb hustled Mallory along 
the line. “Nix on the dames. You 
want to get both of us in hot wa- 
ter?” I took a chance just bringing 



you in here. Sarge prob’ly meant 
for you to eat cold chow on the 
job.” 

“She’s an old friend, Chubb.” 
“You ain’t got no friends, mis- 
ter. Just keep your nose clean and 
leave the women alone. You figure 
it out. You do your job and show 
your loyalty and maybe you get 
privileges. It’s up to the colonel.” 
Chubb led the way to a small 
table in a corner. The food was 
surprisingly good — meat, potatoes 
and gravy, bread, green vegeta- 
bles, strawberries and cream, fresh 
coffee. 

“We eat good here,” Chubb 
said. “It ain’t a bad life unless 
you’re on the colonel’s list. Just 
don’t make no waves — like with 
the dames.” 

“How long have you been 
here?” 

“Couple of months,” Chubb 
said. He swallowed coffee, wiped 
his mouth on his sleeve. “What 
did you do to rile Strang?” 
“Turned down a job offer.” 
“Wasn’t smart,” Chubb grunt- 
ed. “Why’d you do it?” 

“I have other plans.” 

Chubb grunted. “Better forget 
it and get with the program. He’s 
got it all doped out. Got to give 
him credit, he gets things done. 
Good thing, too. Wasn’t for him, 
be nobody doing anything. He 
seen what needed doing, got some 
men together, started organizing 
things. Now we’re getting some- 
where. We’re not licked yet, by 
God.” 

“Getting where?” Mallory 
asked. 

“Getting set to hit ’em. Hit ’em 



IF 



no 




hard.” 

“With what? Bows and arrows?” 
“He’s got it doped out,” Chubb 
repeated. “He knows.” 

“Corporal,” Mallory said, “I 
want to talk to the girl. Just for a 
few moments. How about it? 

“You crazy? I told you — ” 
“She’s an old friend of mine.” 
“Tell that to Strang.” 

“All you have to do is — ” 

“Shut up, you!” Chubb barked. 
“Comes of trying to treat you de- 
cent. Maybe Sarge was right about 
you.” 

As they walked into the bar- 
racks Sergeant Gaunt rose from 
an armchair and strolled over. 

“How’s the new boy, Chubb? 
Give you any trouble?” 

Chubb glanced at Mallory. 
“No trouble.” 

“Good. Hey, you,” Gaunt said 
as Mallory started past. “I didn’t 
dismiss you, boy. You’re on kitch- 
en detail tonight. Pots and pans. 
Nice clean work. Don’t bother to 
sit down. You’re late now. Mess 
sergeant won’t like that.” 

Chubb opened his mouth. 

“Don’t say it, Chubb,” Gaunt 
grated. “I’ll decide when a recruit 
needs a break.” 

Chubb clamped his jaw shut, 
nodded. 

“What are you waiting for?” 
Gaunt barked at Mallory. 

“For dismiss orders.” 

“Don’t try me, boy,” Gaunt 
said, and jerked his thumb. “Pots 
and pans, on the double.” 

F or three full hours Mallory 
scraped grease from cooking 
vats, elbow deep in scummed wa- 



ter. The mess sergeant, a round- 
faced, paunchy man with tufts of 
gray haii* over his ears, watched 
him obliquely. When the supply 
of pots was exhausted he assigned 
Mallory to scraping soot from the 
fireboxes of wood-burning bake 
ovens. Mallory worked steadily, 
in silence. At midnight the NCO 
gruffly told him to take a break, 
gestured to a table where a plate of 
steak and eggs, toast, coffee 
waited. 

“Thanks, friend,” Mallory said. 
‘ Where’s the latrine?” 

The NCO gestured. Mallory 
left the mess tent, walked across 
the muddy farmyard to the 
barbed-wire enclosed area desig- 
nated as the women’s barracks. A 
guard armed with an M-16 stood 
at the lone gate under the glare of 
a small floodlight. Mallory walked 
directly up to the man. The sentry 
watched him come. When Mallory 
was a few feet away the sentry 
shifted his rifle and opened his 
mouth to speak. 

Mallory charged, rammed his 
right fist hard into the sentry’s 
stomach. As the man grunted ex- 
plosively and doubled over, Mal- 
lory struck down at the back of 
the neck. His victim fell on his 
face and lay still. After dragging 
him behind a stack of cordwood, 
Mallory pushed the gate shut, 
walked to the nearest tent. A 
plump woman in a lumpy skirt 
and an unbuttoned fatigue jacket 
was just emerging through the fly. 
She halted when she saw him, 
slapped the jacket shut. 

“Say, what are you — ” 

“I want Private Lori Mallory, 

111 



SEEDS OF GONYL 




Sergeant,” he said briskly. 
“Which tent?” 

The woman hesitated, tucking 
back a strand of sandy hair. 

“Just who are you? I never seen 
you before.” 

“Major Disaster. I just hit 
camp. Snap it up. Sergeant. Which 
tent?” 

The woman pointed with a 
plump forefinger. 

“Number three, sir.” 

“Thanks.” 

“But you can’t go in there.” 

“Of course not. I want you to 
get her for me.” 

“Well — I’ll see if she’s able to 
talk to you.” The woman waddled 
along the catwalk, poked her head 
into the tent. A moment later she 
withdrew, came back past Mallory 
without a word. Lori appeared, 
looking anxious. She saw Mallory, 
hurried to him, her smile fighting 
her tears. 

“Dad — how marvelous to see 
you — ” She huddled against him, 
her arms around him. “Dad, it 
was awful, thinking I was all 
alone.” 

“You’re not alone, honey.” 
Mallory patted her back. He 
gripped her shoulders, looked into 
her face. “Lori, I have news for 
you. The best news in the world. 
Your mother is alive, and the 
kids—” 

“Dad,” Lori’s grip on his arm 
was convulsive. “Are you sure?” 

“I was with them two days ago.” 

“But — where?” 

“At home. In Beatrice.” 

Lori’s face rippled like a reflec- 
tion in disturbed waters. 



“Dad, you couldn’t have — ” 
she whispered. “The Chinese — ” 

“There are no Chinese in Bea- 
trice,” Mallory said. “I doubt 
there are any this side of the Pacif- 
ic. That’s a delusion of 
Strang’s—” 

“Dad — Colonel Strang is a fine 
man. He’s making order out of 
this chaos.” 

“Strang is a dangerous lunatic,” 
Mallory said. “He intends to de- 
stroy Beatrice. His plan is crazy 
enough to work. If it does, he’ll kill 
Gill and the kids along with a few 
thousand other people.” 

“There’s no one left alive in Bea- 
trice,” Lori said. “The Chinese 
massacred them all. That’s why we 
have to — ” 

“That’s what Strang thinks — 
but he’s wrong. There are no Chi- 
nese in Beatrice. We’ve been 
invaded, Lori — but not by any hu- 
man enemy. They’re alien crea- 
tures. Things from some other 
planet, I believe. They have fan- 
tastic powers of hypnosis. The peo- 
ple in the city are like sleepwalk- 
ers. They’ve been enslaved and 
they aren’t even aware of it. 
There’s a tower — an immense 
structure — where they work every 
day on some uncomprehensible 
project.” 

L ori was staring at him in hor- 
ror. “Dad — what are you 
saying?” 

“I know, dear. I’ve already been 
told it’s a fantasy I dreamed up to 
protect myself from the knowledge 
that Gill and the kids are dead. 
But they’re not dead, Lori. Believe 



112 



IF 




that, if you can’t believe anything 
else.” 

Lori shook her head. 

“I can’t. Dad,” she whispered. 
“I’m sorry. They’re gone. I know 
they’re gone. I’ve gotten used to 
the idea — ” 

“You thought I was dead, too,” 
Mallory said. “But I wasn’t.” 

“That’s different — ” she began. 
Then: “How did you get away?” 
You were at home when they at- 
tacked — ” 

“Never mind. I’m afraid you 
wouldn’t believe me. And there’s 
no time now. WeVe got to get 
away from here first. Afterward 
we’ll talk.”. 

‘^hat do you mean? Dad, you 
can’t—” 

Mallory cut in on her protest. 
“Which tent is Sally in?” 

“Mine — number three. But Dad 
— if you’re talking about — ” 

“Did someone mention my 
name?” Sally spoke from behind 
them. “When they called Lori out, 
I knew it was you, Jeff,” she 
caught Mallory’s arm possessively. 
“We’re leaving now?” 

“Dad, you can’t mean this!” 
Lori gasped. “You’re planning to 
desert?” 

“That’s a pretty harsh word, 
Lori. Escape would be closer to 
the truth.” 

“You can’t,” Lori said. “The 
colonel is counting on you — on all 
of us.” 

“Don’t be a fool, Lori,” Sally 
said. “If Jeff thinks we should go 
he has a good reason.” 

“What possible reason? Where 
would we go?” 



“To the house, of course. It’s 
not far north of here.” 

“bad, you’re not thinking of 
trying to get back into Beatrice?” 
“No — not yet. Not until we have 
help. I mean the Old House, Lori. 
We can rest and — ” 

“Please talk sense. What old 
house?” 

Mallory felt a sudden sense of 
disorientation. He shook his head. 
Was he mixing dreams with 
reality? 

“Never mind, Lori.” He shut 
off the train of thought. “We’ve 
no time to waste. There's an un- 
conscious guard lying a few feet 
from the gate. Someone may stum- 
ble over him at any moment.” 
“What old house?” Lori re- 
peated. “I think I understand. 
The house is another of your fan- 
tasies, like invaders from space 
and Mother’s being alive. You 
needed a place to escape to — so 
you’ve invented a house. But, 
Dad — there isn’t any house. 
There’s no place to go. Colonel 
Strang offers the only possible 
hope of our ever rebuilding any- 
thing.” 

“I won’t argue with you, Lori. 
We’re going. Now.” 

Mallory caught her hand. She 
pulled away. 

“You can’t go. I won’t let you.” 
“Lori, for God’s sake — ” 

“No, for your sake. Dad. I guess 
you’ll hate me now but maybe lat- 
er you’ll realize I was doing it for 
you — ” 

Lori brought a brass whistle to 
her lips. Sally sprang, knocked it 
from her hand. In the next instant

Mallory had caught Lori’s wrists. 

“My God, Lori, has Strang 
brainwashed you?” 

“Colonel Strang is a wonderful 
man, a real leader. He’s the only 
one with the strength and the vi- 
sion to do what has to be done. I 
won’t betray him!” 

A shout came from the direction 
of the gate: “Corporal of guard — 
on the double!” 

Mallory took a step. Lori threw 
herself at him, wrapped her arms 
around his neck. Feet were run- 
ning toward the gate. 

“Hey — down that way — ” a 
rough voice yelled. 

Mallory lifted Lori bodily, set 
off at a heavy run along the dark 
aisle between the tents that led to 
the tangled wall of shrubbery at 
the rear of the compound. A shot 
boomed behind them. 

Sally gave a sharp cry. Mallory 
skidded to a halt. Sally had fallen 
to her knees, holding her left arm. 

“Go on, Jeff,” she gasped. 
“Don’t wait for me.” 

Lori whirled on her father. 

“Give yourself up. Dad. They 
shoot deserters.” 

“If they catch them,” Mallory 
rapped. “It’s up to you, Lori.” 
Another shot whanged nearby. 
“Take care of her,” Mallory 
said swiftly. “And of yourself.” 

He ran for the shadows. 

Behind him he heard Lori shout: 
“That way — that way — ” 

As he plunged into the shrub- 
bery he looked back, caught a 
glimpse of Sally crouched in the 
glow of a pale light — and of Lori 
running toward the advancing 



men, pointing in a direction away 
from the one he had taken. 

V 

M allory covered three 
. miles in the next three hours, 
mostly on his stomach. A drizzling 
rain started up, accompanied by 
fog. Vehicles blundered past on 
the roads, their headlights soaked 
up by the mist. Men called and 
beat the brush but none came 
closer to him than fifty yards. 

When he emerged on a hard- 
surfaced road the lights of 
Strang’s encampment were a pink 
glow in the sky behind him. There 
were no stars. The rain had 
stopped but the wind was bitter. 
Mallory’s injured arm felt swollen 
to giant size. 

Got to get under shelter. Find 
transport, get past Strang s pa- 
trols. There'll be some kind oj 
authority in ' Omaha. Military 
headquarters. Unless that was the 
first target to go. 

He gave up the effort to think 
further ahead than the immediate 
future. Shelter first, rest, food if 
possible, rebandage the arm. That 
was enough for now. Maybe more 
than enough. 

Earlier the wind had been blow- 
ing from the east. He’d have to as- 
sume it still was. Keeping it on his 
right, he started along the road. 
He recognized it as the route 
along which Brozhny had escorted 



114 



IF 




him and Sally less than twelve 
hours earlier. It seemed like days 
ago. He thought of Sally with a 
bullet in her flesh — of Lori, torn 
two ways by pressures too great 
for her to handle. He thought of 
Gill, of Randy and Marla. 

Don't think. Just walk. 

How Jar? 

Until you come to something. 

W HAT HE came to was a 
group of large buildings, 
tall, flat-fronted, mansard-roofed, 
rising among century-old trees at 
the crest of a rise. Lights glowed. 

. Over the whisper of the wind he 
heard faint sounds — a voice, the 
thud of a slamming door, the 
chug of a power generator. 

Mallory left the road, ap- 
proached through a ploughed 
field across the angle of the rising 
ground. He saw trees and tangled 
growth ahead. He pushed through, 
encountered a high brick wall. It 
took him a quarter of an hour 
made hell by his injured arm to 
climb into the lower branches of 
a beech to which dead autumn 
leaves still clung. He worked his 
way out, let himself down on top 
of the wall, then dropped inside. 

The ground was smooth here 
and had the feel of dead lawn. He 
came to a path, followed it along 
a curving route through wild- 
grown shrubbery. The walkway 
debouched into a narrow drive 
that extended back past the main 



building. Dimly Mallory made 
out a parked vehicle — pink light 
winked from a reflector. 

Directly opposite him, twenty- 
five yards away, was a lighted 
window. Mallory stared. He saw 
a tall man with coppery hair 
seated at a desk, writing. The 
civilized scene was reassuring. 
Mallory had to approach someone 
for help. A scholarly man in a 
quiet study seemed as good a bet 
as he was likely to find. 

Mallory crossed the dry grass to 
a driveway. He had taken two 
steps along the pavement when 
glare struck him in the face. 

He stood still, his hands clear of 
his sides. Two men emerged from 
the concealment of a tall, un- 
trimmed juniper hedge. One was 
lean, long-armed, with a crooked- 
jawed face and a bedraggled beard 
below a red plastic baseball cap. 
He wore a rain-blackened mack- 
inaw, tight jeans three inches too 
short for his long shins, high- 
topped shoes. His companion — 
shorter, older, plump, covered by 
a shiny black raincoat — carried a 
compact crossbow, quarrel in 
place, finger on the trigger. Both 
men eyed Mallory warily. 

“Where you come from?” the 
thin one barked. “Why you 
sneaking around here?” 

“I was looking for a place to get 
out of the weather.” 

“One of Strang's bunch,' hey? 
What’s the matter? Tired of evil 



SEEDS OF GONYL 



115 




and sin?” 

“I’m tired of evil, all right,” 
Mallory said. “And I haven’t 
gotten in on my share of the sin 
lately.” 

The thin man took a quick 
stride forward and swung a back- 
handed blow. Mallory, off guard, 
ducked back. The pain of the sud- 
den movement was like an ice 
pick in his flesh. The plump man 
backed a step, raising the cross- 
bow. Black fog rose to obscure 
Mallory’s vision. He shook his 
head, tried to blink the mist away. 

“Hey — he’s hurt, Wiss.” The 
crossbowman’s voice penetrated a 
high-pitched hum that filled Mal- 
lory’s head. “He’s out on his 
feet.” 

“He’ll be hurt more before he’s 
done,” Wiss said from far away. 
“Let’s search him. Let’s see what 
he’s got on him.” 

The plump man held his weap- 
on ready while the other patted 
Mallory’s pockets. 

“Nothing,” the thin one said 
aitd stepped away. “Go ahead, 
Deebs. What are you waiting 
for?” 

“My God, Wiss. You expect 
me to shoot a man in cold blood?” 

“But you can take the name of 
the Lord in vain. Give me that 
bow. I’ll do it.” 

Wiss halted abruptly as Deebs 
pivoted to cover him with the 
crossbow. 



“Stay back, Wiss. I warned you 
before.” 

Wiss lifted his hands. 

“All right, all right. Don’t get 
jumpy.” 

Deebs backed away, covering 
both Mallory and the lean man. 

“We’ll take him up to the 
house. You first, Wiss, where I 
can keep an eye on you.” 

T he light in the room was 
too bright. Mallory’s shoul- 
der throbbed. His head felt soft 
and bruised, his eyes gritty. A 
faint odor of ammonia hung in the 
air. 

The man with the coppery hair 
— glossy, arranged in meticulous 
waves above an imposing fore- 
head — smiled gently at him from 
behind the desk. The man had a 
ruddy, pink-cheeked complexion, 
a well-shaped but longish nose, 
unusually red lips, a sharp, jutting 
chin. 

“Suppose you account for your- 
self, eh?” he said in a resonant 
rather nasal voice. He waved a 
small vial of what Mallory saw 
was smelling salts under his nose, 
sniffing gently, smiling faintly. “I 
understand you’re from Strang’s 
camp.” 

“Colonel Strang tried to draft 
me into his army,” Mallory said. 
“I didn’t want to be drafted. I 
left.” 

“Oh?” The shiny-haired man 



116 



IF 




pushed his lips out, nodding sage- 
ly. “I thought Strang posted sen- 
tries.” 

His tone was mildly skeptical. 

“I made a diversion. The rain 
helped.” 

The seated man glanced at 
Deeb standing beside the desk, a 
drop of water trembling on the tip 
of his nose. 

“Brother Henry seems to feel 
you came here to spy on us.” 

“He’s wrong.” Mallory looked 
around the room. It was large, 
high-ceilinged, with buff and 
brown walls, a row of large dou- 
ble-hung windows, roller shades, 
net curtains. Book shelves lined 
two walls. A long table held more 
books. A dictionary and a globe 
had their own stands. “What is 
this place?” 

“You’re on the grounds of Rev- 
elation College — in the dean’s 
library, to be precise. I’m Brother 
Jack Harmony.” He paused as if 
awaiting recognition. When Mal- 
lory said nothing he frowned a 
little. 

“Why did Strang send you?” 

“I’ve told you — I’m on my 
own — ” 

“No insolence,” Brother Jack 
said sharply. For an instant his 
large, pale eyes glared bleakly. 
Then he relaxed and twitched his 
lips into his smile. “How many 
men does Strang have now?” 

“A few hundred, I suppose.” 



Brother Jack nodded. “Guns? 
Ammunition?” 

“They seemed to be well 
armed.” 

Brother Jack’s eyes narrowed. 
“When is he planning his attack?” 

“You seem to know more about 
him than I do. I was in his camp 
only a few hours — ” 

“But he is planning such an at- 
tack?” 

“So he says.” 

“You see?” Brother Jack looked 
at Deebs with a pitying expres- 
sion. “And you thought I was 
imagining things.” 

“I never thought that. Brother 
Jack — ” 

“Get out, Henry,” Harmony 
said mildly. “I want to talk with 
our guest in private.” 

Deebs left the room. Brother 
Jack indicated a chair, waited un- 
til Mallory was seated. 

“I’m surrounded by fools,” he 
said. “They know nothing, under- 
stand nothing.” He leaned for- 
ward, looking shrewd. “What sort 
of deal is Strang offering?” he 
asked crisply. 

“Mr. Harmony, I wish you’d 
rid yourself of the idea that I’m 
working for Strang.” 

“Call me Brother Jack — I’ve 
put aside all titles.” Harmony 
looked speculatively at Mallory. 
“Now, you and I know how to 
accommodate.” His eyes slid aside 
from Mallory, roved around the

room, came back to Mallory. 

“I hope so, Brother Jack.” 
“Now, if — in order to survive — 
it becomes necessary for a man to 
come to terms with forces of the 
Opposition, well — a man can’t 
serve God if he’s dead, can he? 
You see. I’m realistic. I’ve seen 
how the Pit has opened, spawning 
its imps in the world of man. I 
can read the writing on the wall. 
The time of God’s ascendency is 
on the wane— just temporarily, of 
course. He’s testing us, you see — 
to determine who deserves to live 
and who doesn’t.” 

“I’m afraid this is over my head. 
Brother Jack.” 

“Don’t lie to me, man.” Har- 
mony showed his teeth, even, 
white and false. “You’ve seen 
them. I know it. I can detect their 
mark in your eyes?” 

“Seen whom?” 

“The imps. The spawn of Satan. 
The living dead.” 

“¥ SAW them in Beatrice,” Mal- 
-■‘lory said. “Imps or aliens, 
they’ve taken over the city. As far 
as I know, they’ve made no effort 
to expand their beachhead. You’re 
the first man I’ve met who doesn’t 
think I had hallucinations.” 
“Satan’s clever,” Brother Jack 
said. “Oh, I underestimated him. 
I’ll confess to you that for years I 
was skeptical in my heart. I spoke 
the word of God but in my private 
thoughts I was an unbeliever. 
That’s why He loosed Satan on 



the world, you see. I admit it. I’m 
the guilty one!” 

“I’m sure there were plenty of 
others,” Mallory said. “The ques- 
tion is, what’s being done about 
it?” 

“No others,” Brother Jack said. 
“Just me. I’m the one God put his 
finger on. But I’ll survive. I know 
it’s His will. It’s His way of test- 
ing me. And I’ll measure up.” 
“That’s fine. Brother Jack. 
Where is the nearest regular au- 
thority? Was Omaha hit?” 

“Your coming was just as I pre- 
dicted.” Harmony nodded. “I 
knew the call would come.” 

“Do you have a short-wave 
radio?” Mallory asked. 

“You’re a hard man to deal 
with,” Harmony snapped. “Very 
well — out with it! You want me 
openly to come in with you, am I 
right?” Sweat glistened on the 
high forehead. 

“Brother Jack, all I’m inter- 
ested in is locating what govern- 
ment is left, if any, and doing 
what I can to combat whatever it 
is that’s invaded the country.” 

“I see I’ve given you the wrong 
impression,” Harmony said. “You 
won’t let a man even save his face, 
will you? All right — let’s talk 
plain. I’m a realist. When resis- 
tance is hopeless a man has a duty 
to save his own life.” 

“Look, Brother Jack — if you 
have a car I could take — ” 

“I won souls for Christ even 
when I preached empty lies,” 



118 



IF 





Harmony stated flatly. “Just 
think what I can do for Satan.” 

“You’re off the beam. Har- 
mony,” Mallory said. “I didn’t 
come here to make a deal with 
you.” 

The shiny-haired man slid open 
a desk drawer, cased out a Colt 
.45 automatic. His fingers curled 
lovingly around the grip. He 
weighed the gun on his palm, then 
deftly pointed it at Mallory, the 
butt resting on the desk. 

“You can have the others,” he 
said. “They’re nothing. Expend- 
ables. Do as you like with them. 
But you need me. Strang knows 
that. Otherwise he wouldn’t have 
sent you.” 

The door burst open. Deebs en- 
tered the room, the crossbow in 
his hands, his face flushed, his 
eyes shocked. An Oriental-looking 
youth stood behind him. 

“You’re selling us out!” he 
blurted. 

“You listened, eh? That’s too 
bad. Brother Deebs.” Brother 
Jack shifted the pistol, raised the 
muzzle slightly. “Goodbye, Broth- 
er Deebs,” he said and fired point- 
blank. 

Deebs spun, fell face down 
across the desk. Mallory came to 
his feet, froze as the gun swung to 
cover him. The Japanese boy 
made a mewing sound and backed 
away. 

“Now, you spent time with 
Strang.” Harmony addressed 
Mallory as if nothing had hap-

pened. “You must have seen him 
consorting with the Fiend. Tell 
me, is it true Satan takes the 
shape of a small black boy with a 
hump on his back and a tuft of 
red hair like a goat’s beard dan- 
gling from his nose?” 

His eyes were fixed 'on Mal- 
lory’s. His mouth hung slightly 
open. 

“I didn’t see anyone fitting that 
description,” Mallory said. 

“He has a thousand forms,” 
Harmony said. “Oh, I’ve seen 
some of them. In my boyhood he 
appeared to me as a giant black 
dog one night, but I drove him 
away with God’s curse. Later he 
came to me in the form of scarlet 
women, painted and perfumed — I 
knew then that he was stronger 
than God.” He jerked the gun at 
Mallory. “Speak up.” 

“The ones I saw look like poor- 
ly manufactured men,” Mallory 
said carefully. 

“How do they speak?” 

“Very politely — even when 

they’re killing you.” 

“Like the words of scarlet worn- 
en.” Harmony nodded. “That was 
what gave them away. At first I 
was afraid. I confess the weakness. 
I ran with the others. Then Satan 
singled me out and made me halt 
and turn back. Oh, it was in my 
heart to do the bidding of the 
Evil One!” Harmony looked at 
Deeb, sprawled across the table on 
his back, his face a red ruin, his 



feet clear of the floor. “That one 
fooled me. He took the shape of a 
man but now he’s given it up 
again.” 

Harmony had lowered the gun 
— it hung in his hand, pointing at 
the floor. Mallory took a step to- 
ward him and the weapon snapped 
up. 

“Don’t make any foolish 
moves,” Harmony snarled. “I was 
a combat Marine before the Call 
came — I never qualified below 
Sharpshooter. You stand back 
over there, beside Tanaka.” 

Mallory complied. The small 
man was leaning against a book- 
case, his hands clutched together, 
shivering. 

“Oh, it’s hard sometimes to 
hear the voice of God,” Harmony 
said. “Now, at first I thought you 
were Strang’s agent — then you 
spoiled it all. Now I just don’t 
know.” 

“Brother Jack — ” the Japanese 
boy began in a thin whine. 

“Shut up,” Mallory said. 
“Brother Jack’s in no mood to be 
argued with.” 

“Good. You’ve seen F’m in 
earnest,” Brother Jack said. “And 
you saw how I dealt with Henry. 
Are you ready to give me Strang’s 
terms? Satan’s terms?” 

“No,” Mallory said. “But I 
know how to kill the imps.” 

Harmony looked at him sol- 
emnly along the barrel of the gun. 

“You know better than that,” 



120 



IF 




he said. “Satan’s minions can’t 
die like mortal creatures.” 

“I killed one. Maybe more than 
one.” 

“That’s your last lie,” Har- 
mony snapped. “But I’ll show 
your Master I’m worthy. Kneel.” 

He brandished the Colt. 

T he Japanese lad made a 
thin sound and started to 
fall forward. Mallory swung to- 
ward him. Harmony jumped to 
his feet, started around the desk. 
His hip collided with Deeb’s feet. 
The body skidded, tangling limply 
with Brother Jack’s legs. The gun 
went off and the glass door of the 
bookcase shattered behind Mal- 
lory. Brother Jack stumbled, went 
down. His head struck the corner 
of the desk with a sound like an 
axe hitting a seasoned oak log. He 
flopped sidewise and lay still, 
blood spreading in his glossy hair. 

Mallory turned at a sound. 
Wiss was standing in the doorway, 
holding'a crossbow at the ready. 
“Oh, boy,” Wiss said. 

He licked his lips. He lowered 
the point of aim to Mallory’s ab- 
domen. His eyes flicked past his 
target, back to Mallory’s face, 
away again. ^ 

“Killed all three, did you? I 
heard three shots.” 

“Two shots,” Mallory said. 
“Tanaka’s not dead.” 

“Yeah?” Wiss said. He ad- 
vanced a step. “Now it’s my turn. 



Where do you want it? Through 
the stomach? In the lungs? How 
about right in the mouth? Open 
your mouth, you black snake of 
sin.” 

“Then you’ll have* to dispose of 
the bodies alone,” Mallory said. 

Wiss nipped a chapped lip with 
long yellow teeth. He looked 
troubled. He nodded. He cut his 
eyes toward Brother Jack. His 
gaze lingered. 

“All right. Him first. You think 
he meant it — about leaguing with 
Satan? That why you shot him?” 

“He fell. Hit his head on the 
desk.” 

' “Turn him over.” 

Mallory did as ordered. Wiss 
frowned down at the corpse. 

“I don’t see where it went in.” 

“He wasn’t shot. He fired at 
me. Deeb tripped him up.” 

Wiss motioned Mallory back, 
then stepped forward to stare 
down with a fascinated expression 
at Deeb. 

Tanaka groaned and sat up. 

“All right, Tanaka,” Wiss said. 
“You can help.” 

Tanaka was speaking softly in 
Japanese and crying. 

“Pick him up,” Wiss said to 
Mallory. 

Mallory took the dead man’s 
wrists, hoisted him into position 
for a fireman’s carry. Mallory’s 
knees buckled as the weight came 
on hirm He went down hard. 

Wiss kicked him. Tanaka

sobbed. Mallory crawled from un- 
der the corpse. 

“I’ve lost some blood myself,” 
he said. “I.’m afraid I can’t help 
you.” / 

“You can walk,” Wiss said. 
“That will be some help. I won’t 
have to carry you out.” 

“That’s a point,” Mallory said. 
He climbed to his feet, feeling 
dizzy and sick. 

“Let’s go,” Wiss said. 

W SS following him, Mallory 
stepped out into a lengthy 
dark hall lined with oversized 
doors. Their pebbkd-glass panels 
were marked by numbers lettered 
in old-fashioned style. His feet 
echoed on the tiles. Moonlight 
shone through the window at the 
stairway landing. The house was a 
split-level. In the lower hall, Wiss 
directed him toward the rear. 

“Don’t walk so fast,” Wiss said. 
“Why be in a hurry?” 

“I didn’t kill Deebs,” Mallory 
said. “Brother Jack did the shoot- 
ing. I didn’t have a gun, remem- 
ber?” 

“I’m enjoying this,” Wiss said. 
“This is what I’ve always wanted. 
Turn left.” 

They were in a narrower, dark- 
er hall. There were mops and 
brooms against the wall, a trash 
cart. 

“It’s hard to fight sin,” Wiss 
said. “You start out to look for sin 
and seems like you can’t find it. 



The bad ones act virtuous to your 
face — and then behind your back 
they make their pact with Satan.” 

“Brother Jack knew a lot about 
Satan,” Mallory said. 

“Me more than him,” Wiss 
saM. “You outsmarted Jack — but 
you’re not going to outsmart me. 
You’re going to die. Out that 
way.” 

Mallory saw a fire-door. He 
pushed a release bar. The door 
swung outward. He stepped down 
to a bricked path margined by 
garbage cans. The trees stood up 
stark and aloof against moonlit 
clouds. 

“That way,” Wiss said. “I’ll 
bury you in the garden. I’ll cover 
you with manure.” 

The cold air cleared Mallory’s 
head slightly. The urgency of the 
nausea retreated. 

“I’m going to be sick,” he said. 
“Try not to shoot me until I get 
through.” He turned aside, leaned 
against a tree and made a retch- 
ing sound. From the corner of his 
eye he saw Wiss lower the cross- 
bow. He moaned, put his hands to 
his stomach — and Jumped for the 
shelter of the bole. 

Wiss yelled. A crossbow bolt 
^clattered through dry branches to 
Mallory’s left. He ran a weaving 
course among the saplings, cir- 
cling back toward the house. Wiss 
was shouting, crashing through 
the brush. Mallory fell, rolled. 

Wiss charged past him, ten feet

IF 




away. Mallory counted to twenty, 
rose and started back along his 
path as silently as possible. The 
sound of Wiss’s passage halted 
abruptly. Mallory stopped, re- 
sumed his progress when Wiss 
again grew noisy. 

The lower drive widened in 
front of a converted barn. A dark- 
colored sedan was parked there, 
its front bumper against the 
weathered siding. Mallory came 
up on it from the left side, opened 
the door, slid behind the wheel. 
The keys dangled from iht igni- 
tion. He took two deep breaths 
and turned the key. 

The starter groaned. Mallory 
pumped the gas pedal. The engine 
caught. He slammed the gears in- 
to reverse, backed, cutting the 
wheel hard. He braked, gunned 
forward. Wiss darted into view 
beside the house. As Mallory 
roared past at a distance of six 
feet, he saw the bow swing up into 
firing position, tracking him. 

Glass shattered behind him. 
The metal bolt stood quivering in 
the padded plastic of the right 
side of the dash. Mallory switched 
on the headlights in time to swing 
the curve of the drive. The gates 
loomed ahead, massive as a port- 
cullis. Mallory closed the distance 
to them at sixty miles per hour. 

At the last instant he threw 
himself sideways on the seat. The 
shock knocked him against the 
right-hand door. He pulled him- 



self erect in time to see one panel 
of the gate, bent almost double, 
slide off the hood and bounce 
away into the underbrush. The 
car was in a skid, its rear coming 
around to the right as it left the 
road. Mallory caught the wheel, 
steered into the skid, crashed 
through dry stalks and saplings, 
plunged down through a ditch, 
back up again. 

He coasted to a stop on the 
road. 

He brushed glass chips from his 
face, wiped blood from one eye. 
The windshield was smashed. One 
headlight was out. The other was 
knocked out of line so that its 
beam pooled twenty feet ahead of 
the car. The engine, still running, 
clattered rhythmically. 

Mallory’s head was ringing with 
a high, wavering tone, like an 
idling transmitter. He hitched 
himself back under the wheel and 
tried the accelerator. The car 
moved ahead awkwardly. Mallory 
could feel the drag of an out-of- 
line wheel. The steering mechan- 
ism pulled at his hands. 

Slowly, like an injured animal, 
the car moved down the road. 

VI 

M allory put ten miles be- 
• tween himself and Revela- 
tion College before he allowed 
himself the luxury of pulling to the 
road shoulder. He had suffered a 



SEEDS OF GONYL

number of minor facial cuts and a 
painful chest bruise. His injured 
arm ached with a deep implacable 
persistance. His head felt hot, his 
stomach empty. The lump behind 
his right ear was swollen and ten- 
der. He touched it and pain shot 
down along his jaw, upward across 
the top of his skull. The cold wind 
gusting in through the broken 
windshield had chilled him to the 
bone. 

“Progress report,” he said, 
and was startled at the hoarse, 
croaking quality of his voice. 
“Item one — I’ve gotten clear of 
Beatrice. I know what I saw there. 
Item two — I’ve found Lori alive 
and as well as could be expected. 
Item three — ” 

He paused, trying to order his 
thoughts. Thinking was hard. He 
needed rest, food, drink — a doc- 
tor. 

“Later,” he said firmly. “Right 
now the question is the next 
move. Dawn will come in a few 
hours. Strang’s men will be out. 
They’re between me and Omaha — 
I think. I need a road map.” He 
opened the glove compartment, 
bending the crossbow bolt aside 
to allow the door to drop. He 
found worn gloves — which he put 
on — a crumpled paper cup, a 
greasy screwdriver and a much- 
folded map. The dash lights pro- 
vided enough illumination for him 
to study it. 

As closely as he could estimate. 



Strang’s headquarters lay a mile 
or so west of the main road north 
— too close for him to risk that 
route. The alternative was to skirt 
wide to the east, then double back. 

“Would help if I knew where I 
was,” he muttered through lips 
stiff with cold. He had to think out 
loud to make sense to himself. 
“Have to make a guess. Headed 
east from Strang’s camp. Still 
headed east — unless the wind has 
changed — ” 

It seemed to be blowing straight 
at him now. Couldn’t count on the 
wind. Best bet was to drive on un- 
til he saw a route marker or came 
to a town, then correct course ac- 
cordingly. 

“So that’s settled,” he told him- 
self. “Unless I run out of gas — or 
overheat — or pass out and run in- 
to a tree.” 

The car’s front end was badly 
out of line. The wheels set up a 
bone-shaking vibration at fifteen 
miles per hour. The steering was 
stiff. He could smell hot oil. 

“Radiator’s probably punc- 
tured,” he muttered. “Lucky it’s 
a cold night.” 

He came up to an intersection 
with a rutted blacktop road, 
slowed, made a left turn, went on 
for a quarter of a mile before he 
braked to a halt. 

“Why did I turn?” 

He mumbled the question. His 
voice sounded in his ears like that 
of a stranger but he found speak- 



124 



IF 




ing aloud necessary to concentra- 
tion. Suddenly the concept fright- 
ened him. Was his mind going? 
He forced himslef to think silent- 
ly. What ensued was a curious, 
partly vocalized, partly silent di- 
alogue. 

Have to work my way north . 

Sound again: “No. Wrong. 

Worked it out, decided to head 
east, hit main road — 

This way. It’s not Jar now . 

“What’s not far?” 

He shook his head, staring out 
through broken glass at the weed- 
choked ditch illuminated by the 
lone headlight. 

The house. Have to get to the 
house, rest, get warm . 

Sure, the house . funny / 
forgot about it. Right, have to get 
to the old house . 

He started up, drove on another 
hundred yards. 

“Wait a minute,” he said and 
jammed on the brake. 

The sudden stop Jerked his head 
painfully but also served to clear 
it. 

“Going nuts,” he said.” 
“Thoughts all confused.” 

House . old place, stone, high 
gables, horses in the drive, gas 
lanterns on tall poles, smell of sta- 
bles. Home. But not home. Re- 
member it from . long time ago. 
Small boy. Have to go back. Some- 
thing wonderful there. Waited long 
time . 

“Imagining things,” he said 



loudly and rubbed his face. “Or am 
I? Is there an old house? Seems as 
if it’s been in the back of my mind 
ever since I left Beatrice. Even be- 
fore. But it’s nonsense. Old family 
manse? Crazy. Isn’t any old fam- 
ily manse. Besides, I have to avoid 
heading back — ” 

But I have to go there. Tve al- 
ready waited too long . 

“All right.” He laughed ragged- 
ly. “What the hell? There’s a way 
to settle it — I’ll go have a look, 
get it off my mind, get back to 
business. And maybe there’ll be 
food and a bed.” He looked ahead 
along the crooked secondary road. 
“But what makes me think this 
road will lead me to it?” 

You know the way. It’s not far 
now. Get to the house. Then you 
can rest . 

“All right, Mallory. Maybe it’s 
the still, small voice of conscience. 
Follow your nose. It can’t lead you 
any farther astray than you al- 
ready are.” 

He put the car in gear, crawled 
ahead along the rutted track. 

N OW that he had given in to 
the compulsion Mallory felt 
curiously resigned — as if he were 
no longer a lone swimmer in chop- 
py seas but a passenger on a ship 
for whose course he bore no re- 
sponsibility. There might be reefs 
and tides ahead but for the mo- 
ment he could simply cling to the 
rail and ride. He wondered vague- 



SEEDSOFGONYL

ly how far he had come. Two 
miles? Three? What would he find 
at the end of the road? The ques- 
tion seemed academic, remote. His 
job now was simply to steer — and 
stay awake. 

The faint whop-whop-whop of 
beating rotors intruded on his 
thoughts. Looking back, he saw a 
copter's navigation lights bobbing 
a hundred yards above the tree- 
tops, three hundred yards behind 
him. A searchlight speared down, 
fingering the ground, sweeping 
closer along the trail of roiled dust. 

His reactions were sluggish, 
clumsy, as he cut his single head- 
light, wrenched the wheel to the 
left. The car slammed down 
through a shallow ditch, up again 
into a ploughed field. He saw a 
clump of trees ahead. He steered 
for it, felt the wheels losing trac- 
tion. Something dragged under 
the car. The vehicle wallowed, 
came to rest, nose high. Mallory 
jumped out, almost fell, ran stum- 
bling across the furrows and 
toward the trees. Under their 
cover he worked his way up a 
wooded slope toward the higher 
ground ahead. 

The copter circled the stalled 
car, hovered, then dropped in to 
land near it. Moments later it 
lifted again. 

Mallory pushed on through 
thick underbrush and interlaced 
branches. He heard shouts behind 



him. Handlights flickered through 
the thickets. Overhead, the copter 
beat the air, its light raking the 
hillside. The trees thinned. Mal- 
lory scrambled up over a bare out- 
cropping of granite, ran on among 
twisted pines that gripped the rock 
with roots like arthritic fingers. 

He saw a path winding upward, 
closed on both sides by dense 
walls of growth. Mallory heard 
feet scrape rock close behind him. 
He plunged off the path, forcing 
his way back into the brush. He 
had gone no more than twenty feet 
when a vertical wall of rock barred 
his way. He slumped to the 
ground, gasping for breath. 

End of the line . 

Voices came, accompanied by 
sounds men made, breaking 
through brush. 

‘‘Must have doubled back. You 
men spread out there, beat the 
brush for him.” 

“Jig two-fiye. Let’s have that 
light over here, a hundred yards 
upslope and to your right.” 

The copter hammered its way 
overhead. Mallory lay where he 
was, listening to the sounds of 
search. He dozed. After a while 
the sounds went away. He rose 
stiffly to his feet and began seek- 
ing a route past the stone wall. 

He found it twenty feet to the 
left of the pocket where he had 
sheltered from the hunt. Crum- 
bled stone led up in a stairlike 
slope. He climbed it, scraped low

under tangled berry bushes — and pendant chandelier of antique cut. 
was looking across a weed-grown On the. floor at his feet lay the 
lawn at the house. dead body of a man. 



I T STOOD high — even hjgher 
than he had pictured it. The ar- 
chitecture was unlike anything he 
had ever seen — massive, monu- 
mental, ancient and forbidding. 
He walked forward slowly, finding 
an overgrown flagstone path that 
led past a worked-stone horse 
trough where a trickle of water 
still bubbled over a mossy curve of 
rock. Patches of dry stalks indi- 
cated what had once been flower 
beds. A fallen trellis dropped 
over a cracked stone bench. 

To one side, the remains of 
wooden sheds sagged in advanced 
decay. He crossed a graveled 
drive, barely discernible among 
the weeds. Pale moonlight re- 
flected from high windows like 
blind eyes. 

A flight of wide, leaf-littered 
steps led up to a stone-balustraded 
terrace. At the top, across the 
broad veranda, a carved door of 
corroded metal half again as high 
and wide as normal was set in the 
granite wall under a semicircle of 
stained glass. In the center of the 
door was an ornate latch in the 
shape of a griffin’s head. 

Mallory gripped the ring, turned 
it. The door swung in. He stepped 
into a wide, high entry hall, with 
stained flowered walls, tarnished 
mirrors framed in peeling gilt, a 



S OMEWHERE a cricket 
chirred monotonously. Water 
dripped with a slow, patient ca- 
dence. Wind boomed under the 
high eaves. 

Mallory circled the corpse. It 
was lying with one hand outflung, 
the head turned to one side, long 
hair, glossy black, curling about 
the back of the powerful neck. The 
body was clothed in a long coat of 
bottle green, tight fawn-colored 
trousers. Shiny black boots 
reached halfway to the knee. Ruf- 
fled lace showed at cuff and throat. 
The man had been dead, Mallory 
estimated,.hours rather than days. 
The face was hollow-cheeked, 
greenish pale — but visible deteri- 
oration had barely begun. 

He walked into a large room 
filled with shadows. Starlight 
gleamed down through high win- 
dows hung with rotted drapes, 
silvered cracked and curling par- 
quet floor, partially masked by the 
remnants of heavy carpets. Fad- 
ed wallpaper of baroque design 
peeled from the walls above dark 
wood paneling. He saw massively 
framed pictures, portraits of men 
and women in antique costume. 
Heavy chairs and sofas were 
ranged across the room, their 
horsehair upholstery reduced to 
tatters through which rusted 



SEEDS OF GONYL

springs and discolored padding 
showed. 

Mice scuttled ahead of Mallory 
as he crossed the big room, lurched 
through an arch into a second 
room, this one lined with book- 
shelves filled with cockroach-pit- 
ted spines. Papers were scattered 
among the drifted dust across the 
decayed carpet. Gusts of cold wind 
filtered in through a broken win- 
dow almost choked by the foilage 
of the branch that had grown 
through it. 

A grand staircase led up in a 
wide sweep to a second floor. Mal- 
lory climbed it. The high-ceilinged 
bedrooms here were furnished in 
the same ornate style and were in 
the same state of decay as the 
rooms below. 

At the back of the hguse Mal- 
lory discovered a kitchen with high 
wooden counters, a coal stove, a 
hand pump beside the cast-iron 
sinks. A door looked out on a 
weed-choked garden with paths 
and a fountain almost obscured by 
wild-growing shrubs. A tree with 
a trunk a foot in diameter grew up 
through the tumbled flagstone of a 
terrace. Far back, the ruins of a 
gazebo were visible among shoul- 
der-high growth. 

“What does it mean?” Mallory 
asked himself aloud. “What is 
this place? Have I ever been here 
before?” 

He was afraid to question him- 
self silently. His mind was a 



stranger to him. 

H e turned and found him- 
self looking at a high narrow, 
brown-painted door set in a wall 
paneled with inch-wide strips. He 
tried the brown porcelain knob. 
The door swung inward, disclos- 
ing a dusty landing above a flight 
of steep wooden steps. 

Mallory stared down into the 
total blackness. A dank odor of 
wet masonry and toadstools rose 
to his nostrils. 

“Hello,” he called. “Anybody 
home?” 

His voice gave back a muffled 
echo. He felt light-headed, unreal. 

“Came this far,” he muttered. 
“Might as well see it all.” 

Unsteadily, clinging to the worn 
wooden handrail, Mallory started 
to descend. Halfway down he had 
to stop and wait for dizziness to 
pass. At the bottom he fumbled in 
a pocket, brought out a book of 
matches. He struck one with dif- 
ficulty. The guttering light showed 
him a stone floor, the bulk of an 
ancient coal-burning furnace, a 
coal bin behind it, sagging ceiling 
beams and, at the far side of the 
cavernous cellar, a small door of 
heavy planks bound with iron. 

“That way,” he grunted as the 
match faded and winked out. He 
lit another, circled rotting wooden 
crates stacked in his path, tried 
the big iron handle. It turned with 
a dry rasp of rusty metal. The 



128 



IF 




door swung back to reveal a small 
room lined with shelves filled with 
mason jars. A few of the jars had 
burst, lay in shards among the tar- 
ry remains of their contents. 

“Store room,” he muttered. 
“Jams and jellies just like mother 
used to make.” 

There was a sharp snick, as of 
an oiled metal bolt sliding home. 
A line of light appeared in the 
wall, widened as a panel slid back 
smoothly into the masonry wall. 

Mallory was looking into a room 
with walls of smooth gray, a floor 
of dull-polished black. The entire 
ceiling glowed with an even white 
light. He saw bulky shapes. Safes? 
Television sets? They were spaced 
along a side wall. Above them a 
row of six-inch disks of pale ra- 
diance flickered and writhed. He 
walked straight ahead into the 
room. As he passed the door a 
bright point of light winked on in 
the wall opposite, dazzling him. 
He turned his face away. The light 
winked off. He heard a brief 
clatter — like the sound of an 
electric typewriter operated at top 
speed. 

Mallory took a step backward. 
A sound on his left made him turn. 
A rectangular section of wall, 
three feet by six, pivoted open 
slowly. A room was visible through 
the opening. 

An illuminated ceiling shed a 
harsh glow on a glittering frame- 
work erected, over a flat, padded 



slab on which lay a man so with- 
ered that at first Mallory assumed 
that he was looking at a mummi- 
fied corpse. 

But the wizened head turned. 
Dim eyes stared. 

“Algoric, thank God you’ve 
come,” said a voice like the rus- 
tle of dry leaves. 

M allory wiped a hand 
across his eyes. When he 
looked again nothing had changed. 
He took a step into the room. 
Warm air touched his face. His 
pulse beat heavily in his head. His 
vision blurred. He crossed to the 
coU looked down at the shrunken 
body, cocooned in wires and tubes 
linking it to a machine around it. 
He touched a bone-thin arm. It 
felt dry, cool — but alive. 

“I guess you’re real,” he said. 
“As real as the rest of it. Who are 
you? What is this place?” 

“You’re late, Algoric,” the 
whispery voice said. “I’ve waited — 
so long. But you’re here at last. I 
pray it’s not too late.” 

“Too late for what?” 

“I’m sorry for everything that 
happened, Algoric. But I’ll try to 
make amends.” 

“What are we talking about?” 
Mallory demanded. “Are you my 
hallucination, or am I yours?” 

He laughed, then leaned against 
the framework of the machine as 
another wave of dizziness rose over 
him like black water.

. size of the task force,” the 
old voice was whispering. “Will 
they arrive in time? Ah, it’s late, 
so late. But who could have 
known? And now — ” 

The old man’s eyes focused 
again on Mallory’s face. A startled 
expression tightened the oldster’s 
sagging features. He raised his 
head an inch. 

“You’re not Algoric. Who are 
you? How — ” 

He fell back, his eyes vague. 

Mallory leaned over the semi- 
conscious man. 

“Wake up. Who are you? Talk 
to me.” 

The ancient’t face was slack. His 
lips moved but no sound passed 
them. A dangling wire caught 
Mallory’s eye. It had the look of a 
disconnected lead. A few inches 
from its tip was an empty socket 
of the right size to fit the jack. He 
plugged it in. At once indicator 
lights winked on on the console 
beside the cot. A soft whirr of 
pumps started up. An articulated 
metal arm deployed, lowered a 
spongy pad .to contact with the old 
man’s chest, moved gently over it. 
Other muted clicks and hummings 
followed — a complex apparatus 
was going into action. The old 
man’s face spasmed, went slack. 
His breathing deepened. His thin 
body twitched and relaxed. Mal- 
lory sensed that he had gone into 
a deep sleep. 

“Good idea,” he said, feeling 



the stiffness of his lips, the thick- 
ness of his tongue. “Me, too.Talk 
later — if I’m not already dream- 
ing.” 

Awkwardly, painfully, like a 
man in a daze, he pulled off his 
coat, rolled it, lay on the warm 
floor and tucked the garment un- 
der his head. Total fatigue was 
like a scythe cutting all the wires 
that had kept him going for the 
past thirty-six hours. 

HEN HE awoke the old 
man was watching him from 
bright feverish eyes. 

“Ah, you’re back,” he croaked. 
“I’ve been thinking — Algoric sent 
you in his place. But where is he? 
Why didn’t he come?” 

“I don’t know anyone of that 
name.” 

Mallory rose to his feet. His 
headache had dwindled to merely 
a dull soreness but his arm was 
stiff and painful. His stomach felt 
as if it held the embers of a coal 
fire. 

The old man looked stricken. 
His thoughts seemed to wander. 
He shook his head and gazed 
again at Mallory. 

“What is the month?” 

“February.” 

The old man groaned. “Time is 
the traitor,” he said. “What has 
passed out there?” 

“Lots of things,” Mallory said. 
“Let’s start with the invasion. 
They’ve set up their HQ in Bea-

trice. Alien creatures, imitation 
humans. Hundreds of them. 
They’ve hypnotized everyone in 
the city. They don’t seem to be 
anywhere else. The country’s dis- 
organized — in a state of shock or 
worse. Radio and TV seem dead. 
1 saw no signs of the army^ or any 
king of organized authority. Peo- 
ple are accepting old answers — 
blaming each other, Satan or 
communists. Or are simply trying 
to accept and survive.” 

The old man made a distressed 
sound. 

“Disaster, disaster — Again he 
seemed to pull himself together 
with an effort. “How did you come 
here?” 

“That’s what I intended to ask 
you,” Mallory said. “This place — 
1 had an image of it in my mind 
but not as it is. I saw it full of life 
and light and activity. There were 
horses, and people in old-style 
clothing. It was like a dream that 
kept pulling at me. So I came — I 
don’t know how, but I seemed to 
know the way.” 

“I failed,” the old man mut- 
tered. “How could it end like this? 
Betrayal, hatred, death — and 
worse than death.” 

“I answered you,” Mallory said. 
“Now answer me. Who are you? 
What is this place?” 

“It doesn’t matter now, young 
man. Too late, too late — ” 

“Tell me anyway.” 

The other shook his head wear- 



ily. “You wouldn’t understand — 
or even believe me.” 

“Try me.” 

“How could you? You know 
nothing of — the other world, the 
great world.” 

“I know we’ve been invaded by 
creatures that are not of this 
earth,” Mallory said. “What are 
they? What do they want?” 

“Want? You misunderstand, 
Mallory. They want nothing, they 
know nothing — not as you and I 
want and know.” 

“They want something badly 
enough to invade the planet.” 

“No. Invade is not the correct 
word,” the old man said. “Your 
planet is not occupied — it’s in- 
fected. They’re not invaders. 
They’re a disease.” 

VII 

T he MONE,” the old man 
said, “is a single organism 
whose being is implicit in a multi- 
tude of discrete units. It arose 
eons ago on a world in some far 
galaxy. Perhaps at first it was a 
simple virus, mindless and bodi- 
less, existing only as a pattern to 
be impressed on living cells, de- 
vouring them, spreading, growing. 

“But it is the basic trait of life — 
even the half-life, the pseudo-life, 
of a virus — to seek to expand. It 
is conjectured that in time the 
Mone came to be the dominant — 
indeed, the only — organized mat-

ter on its native world. It — or they 
— developed — not intelligence but 
a system of instinctive reactions to 
situations, comparable to the abili- 
ty of some of your native insects to 
construct elaborate nests, weave 
geometric webs, erect traps, store 
food, herd other insects navigate, 
communicate, all without true 
thought. And like other organized 
matter the Mone was faced with a 
choice — evolve or die. It evolved. 

“We have no way of knowing 
the intermediate steps by which 
the Mone occupied its native sys- 
tem, then learned to cross inter- 
stellar distances — or the process 
by which it elaborated its ultimate, 
sophisticated methods of survival. 
We do know that when it crossed 
intergalactic space to reach our 
galaxy, it had become a force of 
fearsome potency. Its encapsu- 
lated germ plasm could endure 
the rigors of cold, vacuum, time, 
until the warmth of a sun drew it 
close. Reacting to the gravitation- 
al wells of planets, a spore pod 
would steer itself to a world — and 
it mattered not on what kind of 
world it found itself. It was in- 
finitely adaptable, capable of 
thriving in molten magma or on 
bare ice at a degree or two above 
zero absolute — or in an atmo- 
sphere of incandescent gas. In 
response to exterior conditions the 
germinal units would ready them- 
selves. Then the pod would burst, 
releasing a thousand self-sufficient 



embryonic creatures equipped to 
cope with local conditions, how- 
ever severe — to grow, construct a 
nest for the Queen Mone, support 
and feed her until her spawning 
time. Then, with the planet seeded 
by worker-forms, the next phase 
was entered. This time all effort 
was concentrated on the creation 
of millions upon millions of pods, 
each packed with the seeds of a 
new planet-infecting force. In six 
months — or a year — or a century 
— when the planet was exhausted 
— the pods would be launched 
from the stripped world, spreading 
the plague outward from star to 
star at a geometric rate. In a mil- 
lion years — or less — the entire gal- 
axy would be only a dead husk 
from which all life had been 
stripped as wheat is stripped from 
a field by locusts.” 

“Spores,” Mallory broke the en- 
suing silence. “Viruses. The things 
I saw were big, powerful. They 
used tools, spoke — ” 

“Your chromosomes bear the 
genetic pattern which determines 
your form, your abilities. This pat- 
tern varies from species to species, 
phylum to phylum. In the Mone 
the only pattern is adaptability. 
Earthly species adapt to environ- 
ment by evolution over a long 
period. The Mone has evolved 
the ability to make instant adap- 
tation of its chromosomes to meet 
whatever pressures it senses await 
the newly spawned generation.”

“All this doesn’t explain what’s 
happened to Gill — to everyone. 
Why couldn’t I make her under- 
stand that something was wrong? 
And why was my daughter’s room 
sealed? Why?” 

“The Mone uses whatever nat- 
ural resources it finds. Workers 
are needed to construct the nest, 
to prepare the special foods and 
supply the physical needs of the 
Queen Mone. Here it seized on a 
cadre of humans, instilled in its 
slaves a false image of the world 
and of their roles, supplied them 
with false motivations to make 
them docile and productive. As 
for the sealed room — if the girl 
were missing, the parents might 
best be soothed by deleting her 
from their memories and elimi- 
nating all evidence of her exis- 
tence. A protective field that cre- 
ates a sense of illness in interlop- 
ers effectively discourages inter- 
ference.” 

“And where do you come in?” 

“A Mone infection on a distant 
world escaped the notice of galac- 
tic authorities until too late — the 
cell spored before it was de- 
stroyed. Many of the spore pods 
were tracked and destroyed^ but 
many were lost. An object only 
inches long, composed of inert or- 
ganic material, is a difficult target 
to seek out in the depths of space. 
Therefore we established a spheri- 
cal shell of Watcher Stations on 
outlying Vvorlds, alert for the ap-

proach of pods. They are detect- 
able at solar distances by our in- 
struments. 

“This is such a station. Two 
men were assigned to man it — 
dedicated men, prepared to wait 
out the long years of the vigil — 
watching for an event of only re- 
mote statistical likelihood — for 
space is wide and worlds are many. 
One of the two men was Algoric. 
I, Gonyl, was the other.” 

G O ON,” Mallory said. “If 
there are alien invaders — or 
an alien infection — I suppose 
there could be extraterrestrial 
undercover agents watching for 
them. But what went wrong? 
How did they get past you?” 

The old man seemed not to no- 
tice Mallory’s question. 

“We were intrigued when we 
realized that this world bore a 
native human population. We 
chose this area for its remoteness 
— near the heart of an almost 
empty continent. The year was 
eighteen-twenty-seven. We felt 
we had chosen well. The histories 
of human cultures on numberless 
worlds led us to predict that a 
thousand years would pass before 
the creeping settlement of the 
land reached us. 

“We soon realized our error. 
We should have acted at once to 
transfer our installation to a still 
more remote area: Alaska, Sibe- 
ria, Antarctica. But we were nor- 



IF 




mal men. We were reluctant to 
exile ourselves in a frozen tundra. 
We rationalized. We accomo- 
dated. In the end “we welcomed 
the availability of the society of 
our own kind. We used our 
equipment to decorate and fur- 
nish our spartan station in a style 
aping that of the distant centers 
of such local civilization as ex- 
isted. We constructed gardens 
and a road, learned the local 
speech. We were still young, pos- 
sessed of limitless wealth in syn- 
thesized gold. Life was rich — 
even here on a primitive planet 
so far from our birthworld. Our 
house was filled with music, gai- 
ety, the loveliest of women, the 
cleverest of men. We had the 
finest wines, the best foods. We 
hunted, we danced, we enter- 
tained. And time passed. 

“Algoric was the first to see 
what was coming. We had 
watched the advance of the na- 
tive culture from the Age of 
Wood to the Age of Coal in two 
of your brief generations. Your 
population had quadrupled and 
already the first telegraphs were 
in use. The experiments in in- 
ternal combustion, electric power 
and wireless told us that in an- 
other few decades your technol- 
ogy would have outstripped the 
capacity of our initial security ar- 
rangements. It was plain that 
soon we would have to find a new 
site, rebuild our monitor beacon 



SEEDS OF GONYL 



135 



in such a way as to preserve its 
undetectibility. 

'‘Plain to me, that is. Algoric 
laughed at me. You see — he had 
come to love a native woman. He 
would not leave her. The threat 
of the Mone, he said, was no 
more than a fever fancy, a mad- 
man’s delusion. Even those who 
had sent us here reckoned the 
chances at no more than one in 
millions that we would ever be 
called on to raise the alarm. He 
would be a fool to throw his life 
away for that remote eventuality. 

“ ‘In exile. I’ve built a new 
existence,’ ” he railed at me. 
“ ‘Would you have me leave it be- 
hind now to camp on some deso- 
late ice sheet and wait a thousand 
years in loneliness for that which 
will never come?’ ” 

“I was insistent. He was ada- 
mant. In the end we fought. 

“I was a powerful man in those 
days. But he was more powerful, 
and driven to a frenzy by lust for 
his native woman. He left me 
here for dead and, after smash- 
ing such of the equipment as he 
could reach without my help, 
fled with her. 

“But I survived — broken, crip- 
pled, shattered, yet alive. The 
machines that would have re- 
paired me, maintained my youth 
and health, were smashed be- 
yond repair, but I was able in 
time to reactivate the scanning 
beacon and renew the vigil. 



“I closed the house. And to 
protect myself from casual intru- 
sion, modified the exterior to pre- 
sent the appearance of neglect 
and abandonment, erected pro- 
tective fields that projected an 
aura of desolation and confusion. 
Against Algoric my measures 
were more specific. I set up a 
tuned band that would affect 
only his specific cortical pattern 
— that would drive him mad with 
pain if he came within the inter- 
dicted distance. 

S O THE years passed. Twice 
Algoric approached. Eacji 
time I heard his telepathic calls 
to me, his frantic pleas to be al- 
lowed to return. The woman was 
long dead. His folly had turned 
to bitter ashes. But though my 
heart was torn I was adamant. 
He had broken the sacred oath. I 
could no longer trust him. 

“One day I detected a faint 
echo from deep space. I moni- 
tored it, watched it grow until 
there was no longer any doubt: 
A Mone space pod had passed the 
orbit of Pluto and was falling sun- 
ward with gradually increasing 
velocity. An short, the dreaded 
day was approaching. The Mone 
was here. 

“I knew at once what I must 
do. The transmitter forming the 
heart of this station is so designed 
that it cannot be activated by a 
single mind. The complex code 



136 



IF 




key that unlocks its mighty forces 
consists of two complementary, in- 
terlocking concept-grids. I had 
been entrusted with one. Algoric 
possessed the other. 

“I alone had detected the ap- 
proaching menace — but the ef- 
forts of both of us were required 
to alert the Great Worlds to our 
danger. 

“We had once been close 
friends, Algoric and I. We knew 
the patterns of each other’s minds 
well enough to maintain contact 
over planetary distances. I called 
to him — and he came. 

“I knew the risk I was taking 
but there was no choice open to 
me. I dropped my protective bar- 
riers, allowed him to enter. For 
the first time in half a century we 
stood face to face. 

“I told him that the past must 
be forgiven, our differences for- 
gotten. Our duty now was plain 
— to join in sending the translight 
pulse that would bring a Galactic 
force to burn out the infection 
before it could spread. 

“But he refused. Against all 
duty and tradition of the Watch- 
ers, he refused. We had lost 
enough, he said, sacrificed 
enough. Now it was too late to 
save the planet — the Galactic 
force would arrive to find only 
the Mone’s abandoned spawning 
nest, a million empty pod-launch- 
ing sites perched on the sterile 
rock of a looted world. And even 



if the pods had not yet been 
broadcast, planet-wide steriliza- 
tion would be required to de- 
stroy the ripening spore pods. 
And in that holocaust we too 
would die. 

“Instead, he babbled, we 
should use the capability of the 
no-space transmitter to escape 
from this doomed world to a 
place of safety. There were a 
thousand planets on which we 
could disappear into the popula- 
tion mass, regain all the benefits 
of the Great Civilization given up 
when we had volunteered so long 
ago. 

“1 refused — as he must have 
known I would. He demanded 
that I deliver to him my portion 
of the code symbol — and when I 
would not, he raged, begged, 
wheedled. In the end he would 
have killed me — but I laid hands 
on a hidden weapon and, as he 
struck me down, I shot him. 

“I fell. He did not, though I 
think my shot struck home. I lost 
consciousness and when I re- 
awakened, he was gone. My head 
was clearer then. Too late, I saw 
the folly of what I had done. Al- 
goric gone — alone — and I dying. 
Who now would stand between 
the Mone and a helpless world? 
But perhaps he would return. 
With great difficulty I managed 
to deploy the life-support cage 
and place myself in it, as you see 
me now. I called to him. There

was a faint response, dim and far 
away. I called again — again and 
again, as I summoned strength. 
Sometimes I sensed a response, 
sometimes nothing. And I waited. 

“And now — instead of Algoric, 
a stranger." The old man’s head 
slumped back; his skeletal hands 
twitched as if to clutch at some 
vanished opportunity. “Algoric," 
he muttered. “If I could but have 
known — " 

“Algoric’s dead, Gonyl," Mal- 
lory said sharply. “You and I are 
stilt alive. What can we do?" 

Gonyl made an animal sound of 
despair. “Nothing — nothing. Hu- 
man weakness, criminal weakness. 
And yet — could you have known 
Riane in her youth — " 

“Riane,” Mallory^ murmured. 
“It seems to me Tve heard that 
name." 

“Tall, graceful as a willow, eyes 
of that strange, pale blue, hair 
black as Zenith. A better man 
than Algoric would have counted 
a world well lost for her. And yet, 
if only my own faith been 
stronger — " 

“I remember now," Mallory 
frowned thoughtfully. “In the 
dream the stories Uncle Al used 
to tell me—" Mallory broke off, 
his face tight. “The dream — this 
house — and Uncle Al. The clothes 
he wore — " 

“Yes, yes?" Gonyl was staring 
up at him, perplexed. “What?" 

“Old man," Mallory said, “I 



have a hunch my imaginary Un- 
cle and your friend Algoric were 
the same man." 

I THINK I begin to under- 
stand," Gonyl said. “The 
house you’ve described seeing in 
your dream is, of course, this 
house as it was half a century ago 
— as it was when Algoric had last 
seen it. His appearance to you 
was, of course, a telepathic con- 
tact, not a true dream." 

“Why? How?" 

“There must have been a rea- 
son," Gonyl said. “Algoric was 
not a man given to caprice — " He 
looked at Mallory, startled. “Of 
course — That’s the likeness I 
saw. You have his eyes, his mouth, 
his bearing." 

“Are you trying to tell me that 
Algoric was my father?" 

“Not your father. But your 
grandfather, perhaps — or your 
great-grandfather. Of course. No 
wonder he took an interest in 
you, visited you in the mind if 
not in the flesh — " 

“Why not in the flesh? God 
knows I could have used a rela- 
tive. I Was brought up an or- 
phan." 

“Riane must have aged and 
died long, long ago. His family 
would have grown to adulthood 
while he aged not at all. In the 
end it would have been neces- 
sary for him to ‘die’ or disappear, 
to be believed dead, never to

reappear. But he could have 
maintained knowledge of his de- 
scendants. He could have seen to 
your care and established a mind- 
link with you in infancy, before 
the pattern of acculturation made 
such contact impossible.” 

“Could have, yes. But why?” 
“Why not? Algoric was a man 
like other men. Though he had 
powers most do not possess. 
But—” 

“But what?” 

“There must hav£ been an- 
other reason. He had told you of 
this station so that you sensed 
my call — my need of you.” Go- 
nyl’s expression was one of dawn- 
ing hope. “He abandoned his 
post but perhaps he had a change 
of heart about his duty. It’s pos- 
sible that he selected you to carry 
on if he should fail. Why lead 
you here unless you brought with 
you the thing I need?” 

“All I brought was myself,” 
Mallory said. “And it looks as if 
that’s not going to help.” 

“Of course you’re not con- 
sciously aware of it — but have it 
you must — buried in your mind, 
waiting for the time when it 
would be needed. And the time 
is now.” 

“You’d better spell it out, old 
man.” 

“The code pattern, Jeff Mal- 
lory. The missing half of the key 
that will unlock the transmitter. 
You have it — you must have it.” 



“Sorry. I wouldn’t know a code 
pattern if it crawled up my leg.” 

“It would be deeply buried, in- 
accessible to any ordinary probe. 
But you can uncover it.” 

“If I can — I don’t know how.” 
“Find a chair. Sit here beside 
me, close enough that I may 
touch you. Then close your eyes, 
relax your body. And remember, 
remember — ” 

L eaning back in the big 
wooden chair he had brought 
down from the kitchen, Mallory 
listened to the whispering voice, 
letting his thoughts rove back in 
time . 

It was night. The lights had 
been dimmed in the hall outside 
the big bedroom where he lay in 
his bed, one of four in the high- 
ceilinged room. The others were 
already asleep. He could hear 
their soft breathing in the dark. 
But he lay awake, watching the 
moon through the branches of a 
leafless tree outside the curtained 
window. It had been a cold, 
wintry day. The afternoon ball 
game had been canceled and in- 
stead there had been “music 
appreciation” in the library under 
the watchful eye of the tutor. 
And afterward; at dinner. Miss 
Wincher had read aloud another 
chapter of David Copperjield. It 
made him unhappy to think 
about David Copperfield. It was 
pleasanter to think of Uncle Al.

Perhaps Uncle A1 would come 
again soon — tonight? 

“Yes," came the whisper. “Un- 
cle Al will visit you tonight." 

And he was there by the bed, 
a tall wide figure. His jaw was 
square, his smile merry, his eyes 
dark and brilliant. There were 
ruffles in the opening of the vel- 
vet-collared coat and more ruffles 
at the cuffs. A heavy gold chain 
crossed the flowered silk of Un- 
cle ATs vest and rings sparkled on 
his fingers. 

“Ah, Jeff, lad," he said, in the 
deep rumbling voice. “Where 
shall we go tonight?" 

“To the house. Uncle Al." 

“Right you are! Let’s be off."

black cigar, just as though there out with toy houses and roads and

cloud canyons, soaring like birds 
with no more effort than a tilt of 
the hand for steering. Then they 
swooped into graceful descent. 

The house stood on a hilltop, 
blazing with light. There were 
carriages on the curved drive; 
glossy horses pranced, snorting 
mist from their nostrils. Men in 
high hats and capes, women in 
bright gowns, crossed the wide 
veranda, entered through the 
open door under the jeweled 
fanlight. 

They passed through the wall, 
not bothering with the door — a 
trick young Mallory had always 
meant to ask about. Then they 
were in the room where the 
magic machine rested on its plat- 
form, a thing of lights and planes 
and glittering complexities. 

“There it waits,” Uncle A1 
said. “In vain — we hope. And yet 
— some day they may come. And 
they’re villains, Jeff, lad. We 
mustn’t let them carry out their 
schemes, eh? No one but you and 
I know about them, Jeff — you 
and I and one other. That’s our 
secret, you see, the secret we 
must never tell. 

“Now, these scoundrels we 
watch for — they always send 
their calling card ahead. It’s not 
a thing you or I can see, lad. But 
the machine can see it. And when 
it does — if it does — it tells us. 
And we know what to do, eh, 
Jeff?” 



“I’m not sure. Uncle Al. That 
part’s hard. It’s not as much fun 
as the rest. It makes my head 
hurt.” 

“A bright head like yours, 
Jeff? The head of a lad who can 
fly, walk through walls and share 
the secret of the machine? Non- 
sense. Your head can do it, boy. 
Try! With me, now — first we pic- 
ture the primary matrix, thus — ” 

It was like remembering the 
whole multiplication table all at 
once — like thinking of every 
move in a chess game at the same 
time — like looking at the parts of 
a jigsaw puzzle laid out on a table 
and seeing in one glance where 
each part fit every other part. 

“I can’t. Uncle Al. The first 
part slides away when I try to fit 
the next piece.” 

“Slowly, lad, one segment at a 
time. Make it, build it, fix it in 
place. Then go on to the next — 
like this — ” 

It was like balancing a chair on 
two legs on a high wire — like 
catching mist in your hands. 
There was no one in the world 
but himself and Uncle Al. There 
were no walls, roof, sky — no 
space. Only the bright, intangible 
abstractions, the elusive configu- 
rations that slipped aside, dis- 
solved, shifted into new shapes. 
But, urged and guided by the 
deep, friendly voice, he tried and 
tried again. And at last the parts 
began to fall into place, their

shifting and. flowing tamed. Sud- 
denly the matrix flowered about 
him, as beautiful and as complex 
as the anatomy of an orchid dia- 
gramed in light. 

“That’s it, Jeff, lad. Good. 
Good. Now hold it. Don’t let it 
slip away while we move on to 
the secondary pattern.” 

Thoughts were coral shapes 
cast in lead, soft and gray and 
impossibly heavy. He pushed 
and tugged at them with fingers 
of smoke while eons passed. And 
one by one he intertwined form 
with intricate form, erecting a 
structure of concept that overlay 
the glowing matrical pattern as 
flesh overlays bones. He was 
tired — so tired! It was a task that 
had gone on forever, that would 
never end. Somewhere, far away 
and unreal, was an easier, softer 
existence, remote now as forgot- 
ten dreams. But for him there 
was only the ever-accelerating, 
outgrowing mosaic that seemed 
to swell now of its own dynamic 
growth-urge, completing itself 
like a living creature that drives 
from embryo to maturity under 
the relentless pressure of genetic 
compulsion. 

And at last it was complete. He 
gazed, bemused, on the blinding 
beauty of the fifth-order Galactic 
code complex, listening as Uncle 
A1 gave him his instructions. 

Then blackness descended over 
him, washing him down, down.

to a dream in which he drifted 
without thought or care over a 
rosy landscape spreading far be- 
low. But what he heard was not 
Uncle Al’s comforting rumble — 
this was someone else, some in- 
truder who would drag him back 
to face bleak reality. But he would 
not go. He had earned his rest. 

“Wake up, Jeff Mallory,” the 
voice crackled. “Wake up.” 

He opened his eyes. For an in- 
stant — before the last of the 
dream concept dissolved — he saw 
the room as a curiously temporary 
arrangement of energy quanta in 
the form called matter, shaped as 
an environment for the curious 
protoplasmic aggregations known 
as human beings. 

Then there was a shifting. The 
ceiling was only a ceiling. The 
walls were just walls. And the old 
man who looked at him from 
burning eyes — what was he? 

“You have it,” Gonyl said. “I 
saw it in your face.” 

“Maybe,” Mallory said vague- 
ly. “I saw things — remembered 
things I hadn’t thought of in 
years. Things I wouldn’t have be- 
lieved I could ever forget.” 

“Now we must act quickly. 
Wheel me across to the rectangle 
you see incised on the floor — 



SEEDS OF GONYL

there.” 

The old man pointed with a 
trembling finger at the spot. 

“Not so fast, Gonyl,” Mallory 
said. “Give me time to collect 
my thoughts.” 

“I can spare no time now, Jeff 
Mallory. Wheel me to the plat- 
form.” 

“You’re in a little too much of a 
hurry, Gonyl. I want — ” 

“To perdition with what you 
want,” Gonyl spat the words. 
“Must you force me to extreme 
measures?” 

The impact in Mallory’s brain 
was like a silent blow from a ham- 
mer made of ice. Light and dark- 
ness whirled chaotically. 

Through the maelstrom, Go- 
nyl’s voice cut sharp and clear: 
“While you dozed, I took the pre- 
caution of establishing a control 
pattern over your brain, Jeff 
Mallory. You will do as I com- 
mand you. Now.” 

The blindness cleared. Mal- 
lory’s head rang with a high, in- 
sistent humming. His fingertips 
felt numb, his limbs remote. He 
found himself standing, moving to 
the wheeled cot on which the old 
man lay, turning it, rolling it 
across to the indicated position. 

Now . 

Gonyl’s voice spoke inside his 
head, a firm and resonant voice, 
such as the feeble quaver might 
once have been. The platform 
stirred underfoot. They were 
dropping down through a black- 



walled shaft into darkness. 
Abruptly light blossomed around 
them as the platform came to 
rest at the side of a gray-walled 
passage. 

“That way,” Gonyl com- 
manded. 

Numbly Mallory wheeled the 
cart along the corridor to the left, 
emerged into a circular cham- 
ber, empty except for a black 
drum at its center. 

Above the squat black cylinder 
a mote of light came into being. 
It grew brighter, expanding into 
a dazzling sphere of glowing mist 
which solidified, glazed over, be- 
came a mirror-bright sphere eight 
feet in diameter that rested on 
the pedestal at the center of the 
room. Gonyl uttered a strange, 
croaking sigh. 

Again Mallory felt the touch of 
the old man’s thoughts among his 
own. 

Now, Jeff Mallory . 

At once, the key pattern 
formed in his mind, met and 
matched the counterpattern . 

The polished surface of the 
sphere blushed over as if a breath 
of moisture-laden air had touched 
it. Color flickered and darted 
across its face. A point of utter 
blackness came into existence at 
the center of the convexity he 
and the old man faced. It dilated, 
spreading swiftly outward until 
only a glowing rim remained to 
encompass a disk of blackness 
sprinkled with sparkling points of

light like a circular window look- 
ing out onto the night sky. 

“Place me inside,” Gonyl or- 
dered. 

‘‘Now, Jeff lad," Uncle Al’s 
voice spoke clearly in Mallory’s 
mind. 

It was as if a door had opened, 
flooding his brain with a crystal- 
line light. In utmost clarity he 
saw the contours of the abstrac- 



tion that was Jiis mind field, saw 
how it was gripped in a web of 
thought force, saw how and where 
to touch it. 

And was free. 

“All right,” he addressed the 
withered mask of amazement and 
dawning fear that stared up at 
him. “I’ve heard all your lies, 
Gonyl. Now tell me the truth.”

PUmSHMERI 







THERESA M. TREADWAY 



She is 27 and this is her first 
fiction submission anywhere — 
although she initially attempted 
an sf story at the age of 13. 
She has spent the intervening 
years polishing her thoughts 
and her style. The job she has 
on the launching pad in this 
month's IF has a fine patina and 
her target lies at a harder 
reach than the moon. But some 
day heaven may alter her 
blood-chilling Planet of Hell! 






den through the night. The sky 
was black, moonless, but stars 
shone faintly through the heavy 
atmosphere. Two walked ahead 
with torches to light the way and 
frighten away the jungle beasts. 
Two walked behind with their 
precious burden, the dying body 
of an old man. His name was Gor- 
ofin and he was as yet unaware 
that this was to be his last night on 
his beloved planet. It was his judg- 
ment time. 

W hen GOROFIN woke from 
his sleep he was still tired. 
He lay quietly, eyes closed. His 
failing heart beat erratically. His 
lungs wheezed and struggled for 
each painful breath. He stirred 
and felt tiny, sharp objects digging 
into his back. Something was 
wrong. The silence, the objects he 
was lying on — this could not be his 
familiar hut. 



The silence about him was ab- 
solute. He strained his ears but 
could not hear the usual jungle 
sounds. The sleepy fog in his 
brain began to lift and slowly he 
opened his eyes. 

Before him loomed a tall white 
candle. It was fully six feet in 
height and one foot in diameter. 
Its orange flame burned steadily. 
Above him were a million starlike 
objects that reflected the orange 
light so brilliantly it hurt his eyes. 
Walls encrusted with more of the 
crystalline objects sloped away on 
all sides. 

Jewels, he thought. I’m in the 
Cave of Jewels, where all Samponi 
are brought to die . 

The old man felt a chill run 
through him. His bony, clawlike 
fingers clenched and unclenched. 
Another chill hit him. He 
stretched out a wrinkled, trem- 
bling hand to pull the white robe 
over his exposed feet. In doing so, 
he raised his head and shoulders 
and fell back, exhausted. His 
straining heart beat like a jungle 
drum. Through half-closed eyes 
he watched the candle burn. Lit- 
tle beads of wax rolled down its 
sides and were gradually forming 
foothills around the base of the 
candle. Some beads dropped with 
little plopping noises. 

Amazing — it’s so quiet I can 
even hear the wax drop from a 
candle . 

As the candle burns, so does 
your life . 

The words of the ancient leg- 
end began to come back to him. 
Gorofin had not thought of the 



147 




legend in many years, not since he 
had been forced to learn it as a 
child. In fact, he hadn’t thought of 
much else besides beautiful wo- 
men, black wine, and long days 
spent by the emerald lake. 

It has been a good life, he re- 
flected. But now it must end. Now 
I must sleep . 

Gorofin closed his eyes and 
thought back to the years when 
he was a young man, strong and 
handsome and much adored by 
the women of the Samponi tribe. 
He had been the best dancer in 
the village and had preferred en- 
tertaining the women to going out 
on the hunt with the village men. 
For this he had been disliked by 
many men but their opinion had 
not bothered him. He had lived 
only to please women, to fish and 
dream away the long idyllic days 
of the planet’s eternal summer. 

The Samponi led a simple life, 
as did all the tribes on the jungle- 
covered planet. Food was plenti- 
ful and war was unknown. Goro- 
fin’s had been a happy existence — 
and a long one. The average life- 
span was three hundred and sev- 
enty years. Gorofin had lived long-^ 
er than most. He was four hun- 
dred years old. 

He sighed. The Jewels under his 
back had become like burrowing 
needles. He looked again at the 
candle. It was a few inches shorter 
and the foothills of wax were 
growing. 

In the last hours of your life 
shall the candle flicker and the 
Eyes of Flame come to judge 
you . 



The old man dozed. He slept 
while the candle burned down 
and down until it was a mere 
stump of what it had been. 

G OROFIN’S eyes opened spas- 
modically. He glanced around, 
terrified. Something was different. 
He looked at the pile of melted 
wax and saw the flame flicker. It 
began to change color, from 
orange to red to green and back 
to orange. It Jumped and danced 
like something possessed. 

A sharp chill hit him. It raced 
down his back and legs. He began 
to shiver uncontrollably. He shut 
his eyes tightly and began silently 
to recite the words of the ancient 
legend. At first they came easily, 
though he had not thought of 
them in more than three hundred 
years. 

And it shall come to pass that on 
the last day of your mortal life you 
shall be placed in the Cave of 
Jewels, dressed in a white robe. 
And the Jewels of the cave shall be 
lit by one large candle to symbol- 
ize the shortness of the mortal 
flame. As the candle burns, so does 
your life. In the last hours of your 
life shall the candle flicker and the 
Eyes of Flame come to judge you. 
If you are found wanting the Eyes 
of Flame shall speak appropriate 
punishment befitting the scope of 
your sins . 

There was more but the rest es- 
caped him. Something about a 
Planet of Hell. What was it? 

Gorofin’s heart raced frantically 
and his breath came in wheezing 
gasps. His fear knew no limits, for 



148 



IF 




he had never believed the old leg- 
end. As a child he had joked about 
it. His mother had scolded him, 
aghast at his blasphemy. Memo- 
ries burned in the old man’s mind. 

Gorofin opened his eyes and the 
Eyes of Flame looked at him. 
They hung above the candle, two 
giant orbs the color of the flame 
that danced wildly beneath them. 

Gorofin was trembling convul- 
sively, sharp chills wracking his 
body. His dark eyes were bulging 
and his once golden skin had 
turned the grayish white of death. 
His heart threatened to beat it- 
self to a pulp. 

And then, suddenly, the chills 
passed and a delicious ease flowed 
through his aching body. The pain 
in his lungs vanished and his thud- 
ding heart slowed until he could 
no longer feel its beat. Gorofin re- 
laxed and let the coolness pervade 
every cell of his body. 

The flame of the candle was 
now only a foot from the floor. 
Gorofin no longer cared about the 
candle or the Eyes of Flame. He 
felt content, tranquil and at peace. 

The Eyes spoke. 

Gorofin . 

There was no voice, really, no 
sense of speaking. Just a hearing, 
like hearing one’s own thoughts. 

He answered aloud with the 
proper words. 

"‘Yes, Eyes of Flame and Bearer 
of Eternal Life, I am your ser- 
vant.” 

Gorofin, / have come to judge 
you. Do you feel that you are 
worthy of Eternal Life? 

The old man was quite sleepy 



now. He wanted only to sleep, 
sleep forever. He fought off the 
desire with great effort, knowing 
instinctively that he could not 
sleep until he had been judged. 
He thought a long time before he 
answered. 

‘‘I don’t know. I never believed 
in you until now. Does that make 
me unworthy?” 

Not entirely. Many are like you 
— souls who wasted their mortal 
lives with idle dreams and con- 
stant indulgence in the pleasures 
of the flesh. / have forgiven worse 
than you. I demand only that you 
feel a sincere repentance for your 
sinful life and ask forgiveness of 
those who judge you . 

"Those?” 

We are many who speak. But 
we speak as one . 

Gorofin, since he felt no sincere 
repentance, could not bring him- 
self to say the words that would 
bring him Eternal Life. Besides, 
he knew he could not lie to the 
Eyes of Flame, for they could see 
into the deepest recesses of his 
mind. 

"I cannot ask your forgiveness, 
for I do not feel that I have led a 
sinful life. I did not believe in you 
because I was born with a mind 
that demanded facts to back up 
what was presented to me as 
truth. I was a dreamer. I did not 
go on the hunt, but stayed in the 
village or fished in the lake. I do 
not feel it was a wasteful life, for I 
brought joy to many, women.” 

Joy? You brought joy? You 
charmed the maidens and spoiled 
them for their husbands. You did 



APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT 



149 




not go on the hunt because you 
w^ere lazy. And you refused to do 
any meaningful work to improve 
the lot of your village and your 
tribe. Your life was full of sins. 
Gorofin, think again . 

The old man felt a great sadness 
for he knew that if he had his life 
to live over he would live it as he 
had. He felt no repentance. 

Gorofin, do you know of the 
Planet of Hell? 

“I have heard of it, but I cannot 
remember exactly what the leg- 
end says about it.” 

Then I will ref resh your memo- 
ry. There is a planet not of this 
galaxy where souls are sent for 
punishment. The souls on that 
planet suffer unimaginable ago- 
nies. Agonies that the people of 
this world could not begin to vis- 
ualize — such things as war, starva- 
tion, disease and mental agonies 
beyond belief. It is the only planet 
of its kind in this universe. Other 
universes hold similar planets. 
They all serve the same purpose. 
Do you wish to be sent there? 

“No, of course not.” 

I will give you one more chance. 
It will be your last. You may have 
a few minutes to search your con- 
science before I ask for your an- 
swer ... 

Gorofin was silent for many 
minutes. The candle was now a 
pile of wax and the flame was al- 
most out. The Eyes watched him, 
pulsating slightly. The flame of 
the candle became dimmer. Cool- 
ness overtaking him made it diffi- 
cult for him to think. 



I now ask for your answer. Do 
you repent of your sins and ask 
the forgiveness of those who judge 
you? 

Gorofin replied, searching out 
each word carefully, “I wish I could 
please you by responding in the 
manner you wish me to. B^ut in all 
honesty I cannot ask your forgive- 
ness for sins which I do not feel I 
committed. My answer is the 
same.” 

The old man sighed as he fejt 
the remnants of life drain from his 
body. The Eyes, the candle and 
the cave began to recede from his 
vision. He felt himself sinking into 
a quiet, swirling blackness. The 
voice that was no voice but rath- 
er an intimate realization reached 
him in his last moments. 

Gorofin, you have been judged 
and found wanting. We are all 
agreed on your sentence. You are 
banished to the Planet of Hell, 
there through miserable suffering 
to learn perfection and truth. For 
only through your soul’s perfec- 
tion will you achieve Eternal Life. 
May you learn well . 

The flame died. 

S EEN from space, the blue- 
green planet was lovely. But its 
beauty was deceiving. 

East of the Pacific but west of 
the Atlantic, south of the Great 
Lakes but north of the Gulf of 
Mexico, .on a sunny day in June, a 
baby was born to Willie and Violet 
Hawkins. He was a beautiful baby, 
with skin as black as coal. They 
named him Gordon. ★

ence fiction. I had always con- 
sidered him a writer of fact rather 
than fiction. He had, of course, 
collaborated with L. Sprague de 
Camp on a series of delightful 
stories for Unknown but I rather 
assumed that these were largely 
written by de Camp. 

Then I read The Blue Star. It 
knocked my preconceptions to 
shards. Pratt was a magnificent 
writer of fiction, a superb stylist, 
and a man who could form an in- 
tegrated concept of a world and a 
whole set of people that exceeded 
the grasp of most novelists. This 
is a universe that might have 
been, where the laws of nature dif- 
fer from those recognized and 
have their effects on the rules 
governing human conduct. But 
while one is reading about it the 
world he describes is far more real 
than many found in the contem- 
porary novel scene. 

The book deals with witchcraft 
— but a witchcraft which offers 
nothing without payment in full. 
And it gives a world history that I 
still find more convincing in fact 
and feel than almost anything 
Tve known in the worlds of sci- 
ence fiction. Unfortunately, it be- 
gins with a rather pointless and 
stilted prologue to set the scene 
and reverts in the end to a some- 
what better but needless epilogue. 
But if the reader will skip them 
completely, nothing will be lost. 

It was after reading this novel 



that I began desperately looking 
for another I had missed, though 
I knew that George U. Fletcher 
was the pennarrie of Pratt. This 
book is also currently available, 
and should be a must for every 
sword-and-sorcery fan who likes 
an adult handling of such ma- 
terial. 

The Well of the Unicorn, by 
Fletcher Pratt (Lancer Books, 
75(t), may well be the best other- 
universe story written before the 
Tolkien books became popular. 
It’s a brawling, boisterous and 
completely delightful story of a 
young man who sets out to over- 
come the forces of empire in a 
vaguely Scandinavian world — 
and who accomplishes his aim 
with the help of Meliboe, an en- 
chanter. The book was written by 
a man who was an expert on real 
history and real warfare. Back- 
ground details— including an 
askew view of the religion of the 
world, something too often ne- 
glected — and the characterizations 
are rich and compelling to an 
adult reader. 

These two other-world creations 
of Fletcher Pratt represent all of 
his fiction in novel form that I 
can recommend. But two such 
fine books would have been 
enough to make a splendid repu- 
tation as a novelist for any other 
man and I’m delighted to see 
them both in print. 

Moondust, by Thomas Burnett

IF 




Swann (Ace, 50(t), is another mat- 
ter. Swann has done some excel- 
lent “historical” fantasy in the 
past. His stories of the Etruscans 
and their godlings have faltered 
at times but have contained high 
moments. Swann generally has 
displayed an excellent feeling for 
the unexpected but logical devel- 
opment that makes good fantasy 
worth reading. 

This novel shows neither the 
delights in invention nor poign- 
ant feelings that have previous- 
ly been so strong in his work. The 
nonhuman and semihuman crea- 
tures here arouse no warmth and 
hardly any compassion. The in- 
vented background doesn’t blend 
in smoothly with real history. It 
sticks in the craw on the way 
down and then keeps upsetting 
the stomach after it has finally 
been swallowed. 

This is basically the story of the 
fall of the walls of Jericho. It be- 
gins in the tent of Joshua outside 
those walls. But don’t expect the 
account to deal with Hebrew 
myths. The action carries rapidly 
into the city to involve a series of 
events somehow mixed up with 
Cretan and Egyptian beliefs. 
Then it leaves all traces of the 
world of its time behind and 
goes underground — literally — to a 
world of intelligent beasts that are 
the masters of the arcane know- 
ledge of the time. These are sim- 
ply ugly and unrewardingly dull. 



The story of Rahab, the harlot 
of Jericho, and her demoniac pos- 
session might have held at least 
some poignancy. But I could find 
very little here. Partly, this was 
because the first-person narrator 
in the story seemed to lack any 
real understanding that she had 
any feelings of her own. 

In the end, of course, the walls 
tumble and Joshua triumphs. It 
really doesn’t matter, since he’s of 
no great importance to the tale 
and since so little of this concerns 
either him or the real people of 
the city. 

Any author can be forgiven for 
a slip now and then. But we don’t 
have to buy such slips. And this 
is a book better left unread if you 
have enjoyed Swann’s other work. 

Somewhat closer to science, fic- 
tion is a series of stories that tell 
of a swordsman on another world, 
much like the exploits of John 
Carter on Barsoom. Priest Kings 
of Gor, by John Norman (Ballan- 
tine Books, 75d:), is the third in 
this serieS,«and surprisingly better 
than might have been expected. 

The first two in the series were 
far too close to the Burroughs 
stories in detail and handling and 
far too distant from them in talent. 
They deal with Tarl Cabot, who is 
snatched from Earth to another 
world, where he becomes a mighty 
swordsman and battle chief. This 
time the planet is a counter-Earth, 
and 180 “ around the sun from

Earth, and hence invisible to us. 
(Its effect on other planets would 
be noticed, however, so we could 
spot it. Anyhow, such an orbit is 
a lot harder to negotiate than a trip 
to Mars or Venus.) 

There we have the usual pano- 
ply of primitive races at war with 
each other, run by a distant set of 
priests. There are the strange 
beasts and the stranger women 
who are the prizes of the fighting 
men. The first two books left me 
feeling it was just Barsoom-Pah! 
Tarl Cabot goes through the usual 
routine of falling in love, rescuing 
the damsel, and then being shot 
back to Earth just as he should be 
settling down to a happy life of 
killing and loving. 

Surprisingly, the third book be- 
gins to take on a life of its own. 
Much of the beginning is still 
somewhat routine in its plotting, 
but the action moves convincingly 
and Cabot begins to come alive 
and develop some characteristics 
of his own. He has been Hero — 
now he becomes Hero with feel- 
ings and attitudes of his own. He 
goes off in search of his mate but 
it soon begins to look as if this is 
more duty than desire. His desires 
humanly begin to attach them- 
selves to other and far more in- 
teresting females along the way. 
And his powers begin to shape in- 
to more believable and personal 
ones than the cut-and-slash skill 
that seemed his only virtue before. 



The real story develops when he 
finally penetrates the lair of the 
priest kings of Gor, the counter- 
Earth. If we were prepared for 
the usual set of human but evil 
practitioners of a false religion 
that controls the planet, we soon 
find we were wrong. These priest 
kings are a lot closer to Brackett 
than to Burroughs. They definite- 
ly are not human and their philo- 
sophy is alien to anything Cabot 
has found before. 

Naturally, there is a war be- 
tween sides, with Cabot as the 
pivot. But it isn’t as cut-and-dried 
as his other battles, and the hu- 
mans and almost-humans mixed 
up with him begin to develop in- 
dividuality. The priest race be- 
comes the real center of interest. 
And in the end, after a scene that 
involves emotion rather than mo- 
tion, the whole affair is far more 
mature and interesting than could 
be expected. 

I don’t know how much further 
Norman can go with his series, 
since he has used up the chief 
mystery of the planet. But this is 
a fairly good adventure story, and 
I’ll be interested in watching his 
development from now on. If he

ARTIN CAIDIN should be 



154 



IF 




a name known to science-fiction 
readers, though I suspect fewer 
know him than should. He was an 
avid fan of the field when he was 
a youngster and his letters can 
still be found in some of the old 
back issues. He showed promise 
of becoming an enfant terrible. 
Then he disappeared into the 
maw of World War H. 

He came back determined to be 
a writer. He wrote war books and 
flying books and space books. He 
became one of the leading writers 
about the affairs of NASA. I first 
saw him as a NASA expert when 
we were together several times on 
an all-night radio program. 

The last time I met him, he 
was talking about being deter- 
mined to write a work of fiction — 
science fiction. I never doubted 
that he would. After making 
much of his reputation and in- 
come from promoting NASA, he 
haule.d off and wrote a book at- 
tacking much of what they were 
doing because he was convinced 
his views should be expressed. 

The work came out as Ma- 
rooned (Bantam, 1965, 75(t). And 
while it was not a great piece of 
science fiction it was better than 
a lot of books that were reviewed 
favorably in the book columns. 
But it was not labeled as science 
fiction, and a lot of readers never 
knew it belonged in our field. 

Now he has another book: The 
God Machine, by Martin Caidin 



(Bantam, 75(t). In many ways this 
is a smoother piece of fiction, dis- 
playing better development of his 
characters than found in his ear- 
lier work. But the book has some- 
thing more and indicates that Cai- 
din was again doing something he 
felt had to be done. 

The story deals briefly with the 
men who have created the master 
computer that will handle all our 
war efforts. Into this computer 
has gone everything we know and, 
to protect it from human tamper- 
ing, it has been made almost in- 
vulnerable and totally autocratic. 
The “hero” is a computer-man 
who begins to suspect that the 
robot is actually taking over the 
men supposed to control it as well 
as leading the world straight to 
nuclear catastrophe. The story 
deals with the efforts of the com- 
puter and the man to kill each 
other. And Caidin knows enough 
about both sides to make the fight 
a good one. 

But underlying the action is the 
feeling that Caidin is mainly trying 
to tell us how it really is in the 
world of burgeoning military pow- 
er. But at the end the message is 
not complete. The hero has to 
stage his final fight for story pur- 
poses. And while the device is in- 
genious, it seems contrived. Dur- 
ing that fight the main theme suf- 
fers badly. 

The book is worth reading. And 
if — as I hope — Martin Caidin will 



READING ROOM 



155 




go on to handle his basic theme 
more completely in either a sequel 
or another novel of unrecognized 
science fiction, it may be worth 
looking for. 

Caidin is not yet a really first- 
class novelist. But if I know him 
— and if he’ll get to know himself 
a little better — I’d hate to take 
any bets against his turning out to 



be the absolute master of most 
who are now recognized in either 
science fiction or the mainstream 
as major novelists. He’s learning 
to transfer his inner intensity to 
the printed page. And in an era 
where compassion too often sub- 
stitutes weakly for passion, that 
is a talent much to be prized.

HUE and CRY 

Readers write — and wrong! 



Dear Editor: 

Has Arthur C. Clarke let his dreams 
of joining the higher-reputation 
bracket of scientists go to his head? 
Has he forsaken all his many science- 
fiction fans of yesterday and today? I 
wonder about this because a new 
printing— the^ tenth U.S. printing — of 
his Childhood’s End bears a legend 
on the copyright page saying “the 
opinions expressed in this book are not 
those of the author.” Or it could be 
this not indicates that he is sliding 
toward the new wave fiction, with its 
false teachings away from science. I 
think real science and such things as 
the Apollo moon trip have been in- 
creasing the interest in science fiction 
and will continue to do so. 

I came to the reading and enjoy- 
ment of science fiction about 1958, and 
since then the field seems to be trying 
to get away from the whole idea on 
which it was based. (I’m trying to 
complete my collection, and desper- 
ately attempting to find the April 1926 
'first issue of Amazing Stories!) I look 
back on Clarke’s “Against the Fall of 



Night” as one of the most enjoyable 
stories I happened to buy in the mag- 
azines. 1 cannot see why he should be 
other than proud of the expanded ver- 
sion, Childhood’s End. I can’t under- 
stand his disclaimer. 

And while Clarke seems to be flying 
away from science fiction, what about 
Isaac Asimov? The first of his two pub- 
lished Caves oj Steel novels was back 
in Galaxy for 1953. He still owes us a 
third and final novel. I hope it is forth- 
coming. 

Last year, the British Science Jour- 
nal ran a special issue on robots and 
had the good Dr. Asimov round it off 
with his summary of his laws of ro- 
botics from his earlier stories. This is 
a monthly journal devoted almost en- 
tirely to the fields of hard science. It is 
the first science journal that I’ve seen 
which publishes s-f book reviews. I 
think that is something! 

When I heard that the British au- 
thor John Wyndham had recently 
passed away, I had just finished a story 
from a 1950 magazine entitled “The 
Living Lies,” by John Beynon (whom 



156 



IF 





I believe must have been J.B. Harris, 
or John Wyndham), It was great 
science fiction and I shall miss his 
stories. With his passing, I feel we have 
lost a master of science fiction, one of 
the few who handled this genre real 
well. 

Now to get to the main point of 
writing this letter, which is to suggest 
a few ideas on letters to the editor. For 
example, how about a new magazine 
from the Galaxy family with a whole 
issue dedicated to — you guessed it — 
letters to the editor, covering all past 
issues of the magazines you have pub- 
lished? Can you see the idea? Well, 
if not, let’s have some fun like that in 
the old Thrilling Wonder aind Startling 
Stories. They had grand letter de- 
partments. — Edward M. Osachie, 
954 West 7th, Vancouver 9, B.C., 
Canada. 

And after we finish with the let- 
terzine, maybe we can bring out a 
magazine with letters dealing only 
with letters about the letters we pub- 
lish, and after that . Nope, can’t 
see it. But we could use some of the 
Old Surge’s zest or the great fights that 
took place in the letters to Planet 
Stories. Start shooting. 

Clarke’s disclaimer was probably 
just self-defense against all the sap- 
heads who took the ending of the book 
to mean that he was one of them and 
that he meant We All Must Be Saved 
By The Great Ones From Beyond. 
That basic idea made for good roman- 
tic fiction, but it isn’t his real opin- 
ion — despite what happened in 2001. 
Anyhow, last time I saw him a few 
months ago, he was still a red-hot s-f 
fan. As to Asimov, his failure to com- 
plete the plotted-out third novel is the 
result of severe writer’s cramp, suf- 
fered when he is signing all the con- 
tracts high-paying fact book publish- 
ers keep forcing on him. 



The loss of John Beynon Harris, or 
John Wyndham, is one we all will feel 
keenly for a long time. He has been 
imitated much too often, but almost 
never equaled for the disaster story 
told with intensity and honesty, as 
well as for many other types of fiction. 

Dear Editor: 

1 am continually astounded by the 
ignorance of some of your readers. 
Take for exatnple Bill Wolfenbarger, 
whose letter you published in your 
January issue. The first thing he 
states is that traditional s-f has been 
wrhten for years without style and the 
“new wave” introduces the concept 
of style in s-f. I may be ignorant of 
his concept of style, but I thought 
Henry Kuttner under his penname of 
Lewis Padgett had style; and J.W. C. 
as Don Stuart had style; or Jack Vance 
or Theodore Sturgeon or Cordwainer 
Smith or even Roger Zelazny. But he 
may define style as smooth-talking 
that covers up lousy story-telling. 

He goes on to call his new wavicle 
writers “astronauts of inncer space.” I 
may be wrong but the only “astronauts 
of inner space” are called psycholo- 
gists, and even some of them are on 
the wrong track. ' 

Your magazines are a nice comple- 
ment to the rest of the s-f mags. Sug- 
gestions for improvement: Let Lester 
write some editorials; get more Niven, 
Harrison, Anderson, occasional essays 
by Moskowitz; get the coherent Zelaz- 
ny; get Joe Poyer. Cut out the green 
pages. And most important, get the 
next thing Heinlein puts out. 

Sure wish R.A. Heinlein would 
hurry up and finish his superhouse. 
He hasn’t had an original story pub- 
lished in 3 ‘/2 years and it’s getting 
pretty hard to classify him as a con- 
temporary s-f writer. Perhaps you 
should hire a task force of engineers 
and construction workers and get it 



157 




done. I promise to yell “Vole for //for 
a Hugo" and run through the halls of 
the St. Louiscon if you can get him 
writing again. — Matt Hickman, 708 
20th Street, West Des Moines, Iowa. 

Don't buck that "inner space," 
Matt. Maybe some of the new waivers 
do have inner space where you and / 
think we keep our gray matter — if in- 
ner space is as empty as outer space. I 
dunno who started the "inner space" 
cliche, but I don't think anyone who 
had the least idea of good style could 
ever take such empty noise seriously. 
Anyhow, you have to realize the boys 
defending the new rave don't use their 
words with the same meaning we 
learned. To them, style isn't clarity 
and reasonable elegance: they mean 
tricks, such as what passes for experi- 
mental style— and even their use of 
experimental is special, since they're 
copying, not really experimenting. If 
they really liked style, they might take 
a look at the best stylist who ever 
wrote science fiction, long before most 
of them had professors to explain such 
things — Stephen Vincent Benet. He 
knew there was no fight between story 
and style; he used both. 

You'lh get most of your wishes, 
sooner or later. Lester's writing a col- 
umn for Galaxy with complete edi- 
torial freedom, and the green pages 
are already out. As for Heinlein — 
well, he finished his house without 
help from us, and / hear he's now 
doing another novel. 

Dear Editor: 

The duplication of American and 
Russian efforts in their space pro- 
grams has often been pointed out in 
the press. However, the first time I 
have seen any mention of cooperation 
suggested was in the Galaxy editorial 
for May. Is such an event so unlikely 
that it could only be proposed in a 



science fiction magazine? I would like 
to see the idea plugged in newspapers 
the world over and put on the agenda 
of NASA and the UN. Space explora- 
tion is too big for any one nation to go 
it alone. It is more than just “bigger 
than both of us," as the hero used to 
say. Both America and Russia have 
had to curtail and slow down their 
programs because of the huge expendi- 
ture necessary. Many other nations 
are interested, but although prosper- 
ous in worldly terms they cannot af- 
ford to finance their own space ex- 
periments. So why not foi*m a League 
of Space, perhaps within the frame- 
work and with the cooperation of the 
United Nations? Why not get cracking 
NOW, and bring the future forward — 
and let our own generation experience 
some of the exciting possibilities? — J. 
Galvin, 10 Windmill Crescent, Castle- 
croft, Wolverhampton, Staffs, En- 
gland. 

Cooperation makes excellent sense, 
and in a half-hearted way it was be- 
gun. American explores the moon, 
Russia works on space stations: one 
concentrates more on Venus, the 
other on Mars. But that is pretty un- 
coordinated. Still, I'm a little uncer- 
tain about the UN angle. There's too 
much chance for every little nation 
there to throw obstacles in the way 
while somehow never paying freight. 
And can you imagine how the astro- 
nauts would be chosen? Arab bloc re- 
jects all Jewish candidates: France 
turns down all who speak English; and 
the African bloc demands reparations 
for white seizure of the moon, etc. 
When any world organization can 
handle something like the Mid-East 
or the two Chinas, or take over the 
arms reduction pltin. I'll be glad to see 
it take over space. Until then— well, 
we're doing it all wrong, but we' re at 
least twenty years ahead of what the 
UN might have done in space!
