THE PRilETHEES PROJECT 



/'"'erald Feinberg, whom we’ve 
mentioned in these pages be- 
fore, is a professor of physics at 
Columbia University. What has 
given him a sort of instant fame 
in physical circles is his exciting 
conjecture that the universe 
comes in two parts — the one we 
live in, bound by relativistic 
physics, in which nothing can ex- 
ceed the speed of light and anoth- 
er one, equally bound by the same 
laws, but in the other direction: 
in which nothing can go slower 
than the speed of light. (There is 
obviously just the one case in 
which the two universes inter- 
sect, at light velocity itself; and 
the search for the particles call- 
ed tachyons which will show 
whether the conjecture is prob- 
able or not is now going on.) 

Beyond that, Feinberg’s inter- 
ests are wide. We shared a plat- 
form with him at a New York 
Academy of Sciences symposium 
a year or so ago and heard him 
speak at length on the implica- 
tions of science and technology 
on the human condition. Now he 
has put some of those thoughts on 
paper, and they are available in 



the form of a book called The 
Prometheus Project, published by 
Doubleday. 

What is “the Prometheus Proj- 
ect?” It is an organized attempt 
to search for human goals worth 
achieving. Feinberg’s hope is to 
establish an on-going foundation 
Whose entire function is in publi- 
cizing, discussing, clarifying — 
and ultimately, hopefully, achiev- 
ing — some of those goals. 

Will it work? Feinberg says: 
“The search for goals described 
in this book is my expression of 
ultimate belief in the existence 
and power of human rationality. 
It is part of our finitude that no 
man controls the forces that have 
molded the feelings that underlie 
his moral judgments. Yet it is a 
part of the glory of being man 
that we can plan our futures so 
that our dreams approach reality. 
There is nothing in the universe 
we can rely on to consider our 
welfare except our own reason.” 

In other words — it’s the only 
game in town. And it’s worth a 
try.

HU 



by JAMES E. GUNN 



Illustrated by ADKINS 



The Pilgrim was seeking Truth, 
known only to the Witches. But 
everything he learned led only 
to proof of an ultimate deceit. 



I 

T He pilgrim stopped on tfie 
bridge tfiat spanned tile 
muddy river and leaned on Kis 
green staff. THe original bridge 
bad been constructed of rein* 



forced concrete and resurfaced 
many times witfi aspBalf, but tKe 
roadway bad fallen into tHe riv- 
er in places and tHe entire span 
bad been "recovered with rough' 
beams of wood. 

Beyond tKe end of tHe bridge 



the market town began. The pil- 
grim could not put a name to it. 
Some market towns in this part 
of the Empire had squares; oth- 
ers had broad main streets. This 
one had a broad main street. 

Although there never was one 
shop that looked quite like an- 
other, the shops in one market 
town looked exactly like those 
in the next. A few stone and brick 
structures remained from before 
the time of starvation, but most 
of the shops had been built since 
the time of troubles. They had 
been put together with salvaged 
beams and boards mixed with 
new, uncured planks that disliked 
their neighbors. The timbered 
houses had upper stories that 
overhung the streets. 

Tlie pilgrim turned and looked 
back tlie way he had come. The 
highway crumbled its way out of 
sight in the distance. Out there 
somewhere it crossed under the 
four-lane turnpike he had follow- 
ed much of the way from Denver. 
From here the pilgrim could see 
the high bridge of the turnpike 
which spanned the entire river in 
one clear arch but whose roadway 
was completely gone, leaving lit- 
tle but a lacy iron skeleton. The 
pilgrim had crossed it rather than 
work his way through the ruins 
and the underbrush. 

He had come to the timbered 
bridge along the highway, past 
old buildings fallen in upon them- 

6 



selves, past ancient middens id 
which, if he dug, He would find 
much rust, much broken glass, 
and strange, indestructible ob- 
jects of materials no longer found 
in nature. 

The pilgrim’s face was gaunt 
under the gray cowl. A scar from 
a recent wound crossed his rigfit 
cheek. His eyes were watchful 
and observant. 

It was time to forget the past 
for the moment, he thought, and 
concern himself with the future. 
He stepped off the bridge into the 
town and wondered what wisdom 
it would bring him. 

'The noise of the town reached 
him first, a muted roar that 
seemed to the pilgrim, after his 
long absence from civilization, 
like a voice from a single throat. 
It grew louder as He walked to- 
ward it and then began to differ- 
entiate into individual voices: 
peddlers crying their wares, shop- 
pers bargaining with shopkeep- 
ers, guarrelers shouting at each 
other, musicians competing for 
gratuities, beggars soliciting alms, 
blacksmiths, tinsmiths, copper- 
smiths hammering out their 
wares . 

The smell of the town came to 
him, a strong odor of sweat, 
spices, and decay. A gout of fluid 
splashed at the pilgrim’s feet. He 
looked up and saw a basin disap- 
pearing into an overhead window 

GALAXY 



;<rpu

^Boelis 



and a sHutter, closing, and he 
sEouted, “Hey, look wEere you’re 
tErowing!” 

“Look where you’re walking!” 
He was told in tEe shrill tones of 
a woman. 

TEe pilgrim drew up Eis damp- 
ened robe and shrugged. It was 
the middle of the afternoon, and 
the fluid tliat flowed in the gut- 
ter likely was washwater, not 
niglitsoil. 

And tlien Ee was in the town 
proper, with its shop windows 
proclaiming wfiat tEe town lived 
upon: at the ironmonger’s there 
were scythes and reapers, shears 
and baling hooks, spades and 
hoes; at the cooper’s there were 
bee Hives and churns, milking 
stools and pails, hay rakes and 
kegs; at the wheelwright’s there 
were carts and wheelbarrows; at 
the chemist’s there were horse em- 
brocations and at the cobbler’s, 
heavy shoes and boots for trudg- 
ing across furrows. 

The pilgrim did not look long 
at the shop windows. Life was 
swirling around Him, as multicol- 
ored as oil on water. In tEe broad 
main street were villagers in tHeir 
dirt-stained overalls, sEopkep- 
ers in aprons, townsmen and 
women in fancy bright garments 
exaggerated in line and ornament, 
a minstrel or two singing about 
the old days when men could 
fly, a band of players posturing 
and mouthing meaningless words 
WITCH HUNT 



Thank you, Steve Dodson. Belated- 
ly (due to the double-time syn- 
drome under which we operate) 
but sincerely. 

Today in New York it has been 
snowing since early a.m., and we 
are just back from a couple of 
hours in Washington Square — 
where a miracle is taking place. 
Ten inches of fresh snow has made 
the Square painfully beautiful, the 
people human and the dogs hysteri- 
cal. Even if transitory, how pleasing 
that this daffy, happy, out-of-school 
madness is the result of an en- 
chantment. It isn't only disasters 
that bring people together. 

Four of us strangers — two young 
people, one businessman and one 
little old gray-haired lady — stood 
and talked for a long time, grow- 
ing steadily whiter, of dogs and en- 
chantments and books. Someone 
said. "It's a great day for a hobbit 
to be home before a fire," and 
we all immediately knew where we 
were at. 

If was astonishing, and gratifying, to hear 
how many Baiiantine Books came into the 
discussion. Particularly happy was the en- 
thusiasm for Mervyn Peake, surely one of 
the most admired and least reviewed (in 
the regular media) of writers. There was 
something about the shrouding snow and 
the silence that brought Peake very much 
to mind, even though it never snows in 
Gormenghast. But it is a day for fantasy; 

7 



the city shut eway by fogs of swirling 
crystal, no artifacts visible, the manicured 
park suddenly become a wild place of 
fallen branches and deep drifts. We have 
an illusion of hardy individuality simply 
being here. Why is snow in the city an 
adventure whereas in the country it's mostly 
a damn nuisance? We discuss this for a 
while. Businessman says it's all in the mind 
— indeed, the whole concept of fantasy 
is in how you look at things. The lady, 
very gently. "But you must take care that 
what's in the mind is not a cliche." Agreed, 
from the young man, otherwise you couldn't 
get half the country to go along with a 
fantasy like Viet Nam. Silence. A gift in 
our magic. 

But not really — today the minds are open, 
at least the minds of those who have ven- 
tured into the park. There is a unify 
among us. Businessman says rather care- 
fully that the man who fights because he 
has a belief is no less admirable than the 
man who refuses to fight because he does 
not; the reason why he reads fantasy is 
that most of its heros are heroic, the issues 
clear. Look at Cabell, he says, Dunsany, 
Tolkien, Eddison, Robert Graves — the 
young man is grinning. "They're all non- 
heros," he says, '“they're un-brave, or 
foolish, or deluded. What they have is the 
integrity to do what they must despite their 
weaknesses. So they aren't really fantastic 
at all. They're real. That's why they speak 
to you as clearly as they speak to me." 

Magic names, magic books, magic 
day. The day will be gone, but 
ihe names and the books remain: 
PEAKE * CABELL • BEAGLE • 
PRATT • LINDSAY • EDDISON • 
TOLKIEN • DUNSANY • MORRIS

resurrected from some ancient 
classic, mercenaries swaggering 
with tHeir swords swinging from 
their hips, an almost naked Lud- 
dite stalking a poor frightened 
blacksmith’s apprentice the Lud- 
dite had mistaken for a Neo- 
Scientist, a soldier or two in the 
Emperor’s livery . 

While He was watching the 
dazzling display, the pilgrim did 
not notice the arrival of a cart 
pulled by a horse until it was 
abreast of him. He drew back 
into a doorway, but the cart 
passed and stopped a little far- 
ther down the street where a fight 
Had begun between a mercenary 
and a soldier over the favors of 
some painted townswoman. Be- 
fore the soldiers could pile out of 
the cart and reach the two, the 
mercenary had plunged his sword 
through the soldier and faced the 
newcomers with his dripping 
blade cutting circles in the air. 

The soldiers stood well away 
from tlie sword and leveled their 
pellet guns at the mercenary. 
Slowly the mercenary’s rage ebb- 
ed, and at last he tossed his sword 
to the sergeant in com m and of 
the squad and let the soldiers 
take him. 

fHplie pilgrim did not see where 
the soldiers took the mer- 
cenary or what they did with him. 
He did not have to see; he knew 
the Emperor’s justice and the 

GALAXY 



Emperor’s mercy. His attention, 
However, was distracted by a loud 
roar from the direction of the riv- 
er, back tHe way He Had come. 
An open truck loaded witH wa- 
termelons was sweeping downriv- 
er making a spray of water on 
eacH side like a thousand legs 
and a wake behind like that left 
on a still pond by a giant water- 
bug. WKen tHe truck reacEed tHe 
bridge it nosed over tlie bank and 
climbed to street level and came 
down tHe street, blowing dust 
even more furiously than it Had 
blown water. 

The people in the street saun- 
tered away toward the shops and 
turned tKeir backs to the gale, 
scarcely pausing in tHeir conver- 
sations. Then the truck pulled 
up in front of an open market 
for garden produce, decreased the 
volume of its thunder, eased 
down on its inflated pads, and 
shut off its witchpower entirely. 

In the comparative silence tfiat 
followed, the pilgrim turned to 
the shopkeeper behind Him and 
asked, “What do you call this 
town?” 

“Lawrence.” 

“And this street?” 

“People Here always Have call- 
ed it Massachusetts, but no one 
knows why.” 

’’The Allegheny Republic has a 
place called Massachusetts,” the 
pilgrim said. 

“Is tliat so?” tlie tradesman 

WITCH HUNT 



asked politely. “May I sell you a 
liniment, an embrocation?” 

The pilgrim smiled, but the 
right side of His mouth drew up 
more than his left, and his ex- 
pression looked more like a sneer. 
“I Have no Horse save sHank’s 
mare,” he said, “and the last six 
months have toughened Her won- 
derfully.” 

From nearby came sounds of 
scuffling followed by a protest 
in what sounded like a girl’s 
voice or a young boy’s and the 
rough questions of a man. 

“You are a girl!” the man said. 

“A woman!” the other respond- 
ed. 

nplie pilgrim turned toward the 
street. Not far from him was 
a figure cowled and robed in gray 
monk’s clotH like Himself, but 
slighter in build and stature. Be- 
side that pilgrim, Holding one 
arm, shaking it for emphasis, was 
a mercenary with an unruly Head 
of blond Hair and a yellow beard. 

“You know the difference be- 
tween a girl and a woman?” the 
mercenary said. He pulled the 
other pilgrim dose to whisper in 
an ear. 

“None of your business,” the 
pilgrim said. 

“But it is tlie business of every 
man with every woman,” the 
mercenary said, and laughed. 

“You’ll never make it around,” 
the pilgrim said. 

9 



“I’ll die trying, and I’ll die 
happy.” 

“Try this woman,” the pilgrim 
said, “and you’ll never Have a 
chance to try anotKer.” 

“Pilgrims are supposed to seek 
experience.” 

“We seek tKe trutH. Let go my 
arm.” 

“Pilgrims are not supposed to 
be girls.” 

“There's no law,” said tEe pil- 
grim, twisting out of Eis grasp and 
moving down tHe street. 

“But th'ere is,” said tKe mercen- 
ary, striding to catcH up, “nat- 
ural law. WKat Has not been 
should not be.” 

“Go away,” said tEe girl. TEe 
pilgrim was sure now tEat it was 
a girl. He Had caugKt a glimpse 
of her face as sEe passed. Not 
only was it a girl, it was a girl 
he knew, too well. He Ead known 
it even earlier, as Ee Eeard Her 
voice. He pulled Himself back 
farther in the doorway. 

“Not unless you go with me,” 
the mercenary said, catching Eer 
arm again. 

“Molest not the pilgrim,” said 
a fanner, gripping and re-grip- 
ping a sickle He had been testing 
at a shop. 

“Let the pilgrim go in peace,”' 
said another farmer, stepping up 
beside the first. 

“This is no Honest pilgrim,” the 
mercenary said. “Look!” He 
flung back the girl’s Kood, “It is a 
10 



girl masquerading as a pilgrim, 
profaning the robes she wears.” 

“I’M an Honest pilgrim,” tEe 
girl said, “seeking tEe truth as 
well as any man, and when I 
find it I will know it as well as 
any man because I Have been to 
tHe witch schools and studied 
well ...” 

THe first farmer scratched his 
neck. “I never knew a girl to foe 
a pilgrim.” 

“There are many,” tEe girl said, 
“although not so many in these 
parts as elsewhere, and not so 
Many as there are men, who. can 
better be spared — ” 

“I never knew a woman pil- 
grim either,” said the second 
farmer. 

“You see?” tEe mercenary said 
pEeerily. “You might as well 
come along with me. You Have 
no future in this pilgrim line.” 
His voice softened. “Come. Even 
though you look like a boy and 
are stubborn as a mule, you ap- 
peal to me. I’ll treat you kindly 
while we’re together and leave 
you no worse, I do believe, than 
you are now.” 

H e began to pull Eer toward a 
nearby tavern, but she 
reached up her free Hand, snake- 
like, and sank her fingers into 
Eis face. Just as quickly, fie 
swung fiis right Hand and cuffed 
fier to the ground. As sfie lay on 
on the decaying rubbery surface, 

GALAXY 



lie brougfit liis rigfit Hand to His 
face, wiped the blood, and looked 
at it on His fingers. 

“I like spirit in a woman but 
not spite,” He said. “But I’ll soon 
beat tHat out of you.” 

He reached again for Her arm 
but found his Hand blocked by 
a green staff. Tfie pilgrim was 
standing Half between them. 

“Do not interfere, pilgrim,” 
tHe mercenary said. “I would not 
willingly injure someone of your 
calling, but I will not stay my 
Hand from one wKo gets in my 
way.” 

“THe girl is a pilgrim,” tfie pil- 
grim said. “She said so, and I tell 
you so. And if sfie were not I 
would not willingly see you take 
by force any unwilling woman.” 

“You are a fool, pilgrim,” said 
the mercenary and reached for 
his sword. 

Before tfie Hilt Had parted from 
the scabbard, the pilgrim’s staff 
had swung around to rap Him 
sharply on the wrist. 

“Fight!” came an outcry from 
up and down the street. “THe pil- 
grim and tfie mercenary fight!” 

The mercenary released tfie 
sword Handle and nursed His wrist 
with his left hand. “It’s broken, 
I think, damn you,” fie said. But 
as fie said it lie was lunging to- 
ward tfie pilgrim witfi a knife 
in his left Hand. 

The pilgrim stopped fiim with 
a jab of the staff to a spot where 
12 



his ribs joined, and tfien tfie oth- 
er end of the staff whipped, 
whistling, through! tHe air to 
smack solidly against tfie mercen- 
ary’s skull. 

Tfie mercenary dropped like a 
puppet whose strings Had been re- 
leased. He lay in tfie street, breath- 
ing raggedly, senseless. 

“Good for you, pilgrim,” some- 
one said. 

“Soldiers are coming. Better 
leave,” said another. 

Tfie pilgrim did not move. He 
looked down at tfie girl. Sfie was 
sitting up, rubbing Her jaw. Witfi 
her cowl down about her- shoul- 
ders and fier brown Kair cropped 
short, sfie looked as much like a 
boy as a girl but there was some- 
thing unmistakably feminine 
about tfie contours of her face. 

T he pilgrim reached liis hand 
down to Kelp her to Her feet, 
but she knocked the Hand away 
and scrambled up without aid. 

“You got away,” the pilgrim 
said. 

“Obviously. And so did you,” 
the girl said. 

“But we can’t seem to stay 
apart.” 

“Nobody asked for your Kelp,” 
she said. 

“Where fiave I Heard this all 
before?” the pilgrim said. “I’ve 
gotten into this frightening Habit, 
and I find myself involved be- 
fore I know it.” 



GALAXY 



“TEe soldiers,” someone sEout- 
ed from tEe crowd. “They’re 
here.” 

TEere were six of them, in uni- 
form, fully armed, working tEeir 
iway through tEe crowd. TEe pil- 
grim turned back to tEe girl, 
but sHe was gone and so was tEe 
senseless mercenary, wEo, it seem- 
ed, was senseless no longer. 

TEe furtEer progress of the sol- 
diers was blocked by farmers 
Standing sEoulder to shoulder. 

“Make way,” tEe sergeant said. 

“You’ll not take tEe pilgrim,” 
One of tEe farmers said. “You’ll 
not take one who was only pro- 
tecting a girl from a mercenary 
and spilled no blood.” 

“Make way Eere in tEe name of 
ffie Emperor!” 

“A pilgrim Eas immunity,” 
said another farmer. “He cannot 
be tried in tEe Emperor’s courts.” 

TEe captain will be the judge 
of tHat,” tEe sergeant said. “We 
will take him in, and if he’s inno- 
cent Ee’ll be released with' no 
Harm. 

“You’ll not take the pilgrim,” 
tEe first farmer said. 

Above the heads of the soldiers, 
floating down the street, came a 
flaming orange ball of witcH 
fire. One of the farmers pointed 
at it. “TEe witches have come to 
claim tEeir own.” 

TEe soldiers fidgeted, but tEe 
sergeant said, “TEe witcE fire 
never has been known to harm 



anyone. We’ll take tEe pilgrim 
whether you let us or no. Men, 
take aim!” 

“Wait,” the pilgrim said. “Let 
tEem tErougE. I’ll go with die 
soldiers. I have no fear of the 
captain or tEe Emperor’s court.” 
“You don’t know tEis captain 
or tEis court,” a farmer mutter- 
ed. “It’ll not be fair or pleasant.” 
“I wish' to go with them,” the 
pilgrim said. 

TEe farmers parted. TEe sol- 
diers moved between tEem, grab- 
bed tEe pilgrim’s arms, and hus- 
tled him toward tEe waiting cart. 

“Do not mistreat tEe pilgrim,” 
a farmer called after them, “or 
the witches will take care of you.” 
A shudder ran through the two 
soldiers holding tEe pilgrim. TKey 
feared tEe witches, but not enough 
to let tEe pilgrim loose. They fear- 
ed the sergeant more, and the 
sergeant feared tEe captain. Who 
did the captain fear? 

The pilgrim looked off down 
tEe street. TEe city Ball was evi- 
dently the old, white stone and 
red brick building several streets 
away. Beyond it, built on a hill, 
Ee caught the distant glint of a 
witch’s chapel rising above what 
must be a witch-doctor’s villa. 

The cart lurched down the 
street, the witch fire sitting on 
the rigEt front post. No one dared 
to brusE it aside. And Ee thought 
about Eow his pilgrimage Bad be- 
gun. 



WITCH HUNT

II 



Tt Had Begun: months earlier. 

The pilgrim walked down 
the side of tHe divided' highway 
which in some places, for some 
forgotten Historical reasons, was 
called a turnpike and in otHers 
an interstate. He breatKed in tiie 
good morning air, winy at this 
altitude. He enjoyed the warmth 
of the bright sun, alone in the 
blue sky. He swung the green 
staff he Had cut in a stream bed 
a few miles back where He Had 
enjoyed His breakfast of sausage 
and bread a farmer Had given 
Him, washed down with mountain 
wafer. 

THe highway was in good con- 
dition Here. Although the weeds 
on each side were chest high, tHe 
black rubbery substance with 
which the ancients covered many 
of their roads was still relatively 
infact, marred only by an occa- 
sional patch of grass which Had 
grown through a crack. 

For the Hundredth time since 
He Had started along this great 
highway that bisected tHe Central 
Empire, He wondered How the 
ancients Had built it and all tHe 
lesser roads of which relics re- 
mained. PerHaps it Had not been 
built by men at all but by witch- 
es and witchcraft. The witch- 
doctors said not. They said that 
once men used machines that 
did all the work for them. 

14 



And they Had died for It, 
the pilgrim reflected. 

The witch-doctor with whom 
He Had studied would not Have 
agreed. “There is no evil in ma- 
chines,” He said once. “THere were 
only evil people who used ma- 
chines or weak people who were 
used by them. If you can learn 
this much, you will know more 
than all but a few of the people 
you see around you, for their an- 
cient fears are strong.” 

“Tfiat’s not Hard to learn.” 
“You are a strange man,” the 
witch-doctor said. Some people 
might call you cynical or amoral, 
I think you are brilliant and 
have not yet found anything to 
believe in. And when you do — ■ 
the universe had better watch 
out. OtHers are different. What 
they cannot understand, what 
they can never Hope to do them- 
selves, is magic — they must con- 
sider it magic if they are to live 
with it at all.” 

“I think it is time men built 
machines again. Or they will die, 
as they have lived, futilely.” 

“You do not know people,” 
the witch-doctor said. “You must 
go live among them when you 
begin your pilgrimage, to get to 
know them as well as to seek 
truth, to learn why a few among 
them can do as you say but the 
many cannot, and 1 you must de- 
cide how to separate the few from 
the many.” 



GALAXY 



r T''he pilgrim stretched his arms 
wide as he walked, feeling 
strangely joyous this bright morn- 
ing, as if this morning great reve- 
lations would come to him, He 
would find the truth or part of 
it. 

He walked now where strange 
machines once had Hurtled, if the 
old tales were to be believed, with 
their cargoes of men and animals 
and priceless goods. The tales had 
to be true, he thought, for how 
else would one explain these 
roads used now only by an occa- 
sional foot traveler, a cart, or 
a farmer’s truck floating to mar- 
ket? 

It was ironic, he thought, that 
the farmers of the Empire rode 
swiftly and the soldiers of the 
Empire, even the Emperor Bart- 
lett himself, traveled no faster 
than a horse could go. But the 
Emperor had seized trucks and 
used them briefly and within 
months they Had lost all power 
and were worthless. Some said 
that the spell wore off. The Em- 
peror did not believe it. But the 
brave men who tried to explore 
the workings of the trucks died 
horrible, wasting deaths. 

Ahead of him the pilgrim saw 
the beginnings of a wooded area. 
The highway had fallen into a 
river, and trees had grown up 
around it and through it until the 
roadway Had virtually disappear- 
ed. 

WITCH HUNT 



The pilgrim debated trying 
to find a way around the woods, 
thought better of it, and made 
his way between the trees. 

The trees were largely cotton- 
woods and thorny locusts with' a 
few oaks scattered among them. 
When the wind blew, the cot- 
tonwood leaves rustled like sheets 
of paper being rubbed together. 
The air which had been clean 
and clear now was thick with the 
odor of growing things and the 
fishy smell of the river. 

For a little way into the woods 
there was a path 1 , but it petered 
out among the trees and the un- 
derbrush, and the pilgrim had to 
make his way alone. After half an 
Hour He was beginning to think 
he would have to turn about and 
try to find his way back to the 
path when He heard voices ahead 
and broke from between the trees 
into a clearing. 

In the middle of the clearing 
was a small house built of rough- 
ly sawn boards. It had a thatch- 
ed roof and a smoking chimney 
at the near side. Beyond the 
House was a small garden plot; a 
pig was rooting in it. In front 
of the House was a group of 
three men wrestling with a girl 
whose long brown hair swung 
wildly as she struggled silently 
with the men. Another man stood 
at one side and watched. It was 
he who said quietly, “Let Her go. 
We have a visitor.” 

15 



T he other three swung to face 
tHe pilgrim, but one of them 
continued to grasp tHe girl’s 
wrists. THey were ragged men 
wearing wfiat Had once been the 
Emperor’s uniform. Deserters, 
tHe pilgrim thought. Perhaps out- 
laws in other ways by this time. 

“Forgive me for breaking in 
upon you like this,” the pilgrim 
said, “Please go on with what- 
ever you were doing and I’ll go 
back the way I came.” 

“We can’t let you do that,” 
said the quiet one. “You might 
bring other people before we’re 
finished here. I think we’ll have 
to tie you up like the old man.” 

“I don’t think I’d like that,” 
the pilgrim? said. He noticed that 
two of tHe three men who Had 
been struggling with the girl Had 
recent scratches on their faces. 
“I think we’d all be happier if 
we went our separate ways.” 
“You fool!” said the girl. “Let 
them tie you up!” Her face was 
earnest and intense and quite 
pretty, the pilgrim thought, but 
too willful for His own taste. 

“If He will not persuade, we 
must use stronger arguments,” 
the quiet one said. “Sam, you 
approacH him from the right. 
Jones, you take the left. I’ll be in 
the middle. If He tries to run 
He won’t get far in tlie under- 
brush. WatcH the quarterstaff! 
A man with a quarterstaff may 
know How to use it.” 

16 



“It’s the worst of bad luck to 
Harm a pilgrim,” tHe pilgrim 
said, watching tKeif eyes as He 
talked. THe quiet one’s eyes were 
steady and blue and focused un- 
waveringly on the pilgrim’s staff. 
He Had drawn a short sword from 
His belt and Had it in His hand. 
THe one called Jones Had shifty 
little eyes and a ferret mouth at 
whicH ferret teeth gnawed con- 
tinually. He, too, Had a sword, 
but it was raised to strike rath- 
er than to thrust like their lead- 
er’s. The one called Sam looked 
dumb and sleepy. He had a club', 

“Well,” said the quiet one,- “we 
aren’t trying to Harm you, you 
know, only detain you for a little. 
And we don’t know for sure you 
are a pilgrim, even if you are 
wearing a cowl. And, anyway, 
the way our luck Has been run- 
ning it couldn’t get mucH worse. 
So, if I were you, I’d throw down 
that staff before you get hurt — 
accidentally.” 

“Speaking of luck, there’s some 
blue witcH fire on the chimney 
now,” the pilgrim said. 

None of them moved their 
Heads, but the pilgrim thought he 
detected a flicker of uncertainty 
and struck. The staff whacked 
Jones on the wrist, making him 
drop his sword, and the other 
end whipped around to thump the 
leader on the Head. But before He 
could swing the other end against 
Sam, the club hit tlie side of 

GALAXY 



His head and lie went down. The 
last thing he saw, or thought he 
saw, was the ball of witch fire ac- 
tually sitting on the chimney. 

ATThen the pilgrim awoke, his 
* ’ head throbbed and his 
shoulders ached. He knew why his 
head throbbed. His shoulders 
ached from being pulled back by 
the hands tied behind him. He 
opened his eyes, but he couldn’t 
see anything. The air was close 
and full of the odors of cooking 
and living, and he decided he was 
inside the little house. He tried 
to wriggle upright, but his feet 
were bound, too. 

“So you’re awake now,” the 
girl said. Her voice seemed 
weary and truculent. 

But it was close, and the pil- 
grim wriggled toward it until his 
body came up against something 
softer than a wall. “Yes,” he said 
quietly. “Where are they?” 
“They’ve finished with me for 
the moment,” she said, “so now 
they’re getting ready to torture 
my father to make him tell where 
he has hidden the gold.” 

“Why doesn’t he tell them?” 
“He doesn’t have any gold. 
Nobody has around here any 
more, but myths survive a thou- 
sand fatal blows. The Emperor’s 
soldiers won’t believe us, and now 
these! All my father has is me 
and a bad heart. Why didn’t you 
stay out of this?” 

WITCH HUNT 



“I couldn’t very well keep firoaS 
stumbling into this clearing.” 
“Most people would. They, 
wouldn’t come blundering in. If 
you had peeked cautiously, you 
could have gone on without harm. 
We’d all have been much better 
off.” 

“I thought I might get a little 
gratitude for trying to protect 
you.” 

“Rot! You were trying to pro- 
tect yourself.” 

“True. But why would you 
Have been better off?” 

“Those men were deserters, but 
they weren’t beyond decency. 
All they wanted when they stop- 
ped was some food and a kiss or 
two.” 

“You were struggling!” 

“That’s my decision and my re- 
sponsibility. You had no business 
making us pay for your actions,” 
“Suppose they hadn’t stopped 
at a kiss or two?” 

“Would I have been any worse 
off? You are a meddling pilgrim! 
If you’d only let them tie you 
up, even then it might have been 
all right, but you had to be a 
hero. You sprained the wrist of 
the mean one and made Him 
meaner. And you stunned the 
leader who had kept them from 
going wild, who wanted them to 
move along. He hasn’t said a 
word since. 

“They’ve raped me three times, 
and after they kill my father they 

17 



are going to kill you and take me 
witfi tHem until they tire of me. 
And it’s all your fault.” 

“I didn’t bring tfiem to tfiis 
clearing.” 

“You brougfit yourself. Tfiat’s 
disaster enougfi.” 

'T'fiey lay on tfie rougfi floor, 
back to back. THe pilgrim 
felt tHe splinters against fiis 
cbeek, smelled tfie wood fire 
burning in tfie next room, and 
listened to tfie sound of tfie girl’s 
angry breatfiing. 

“Well,” fie said, “we’d better 
do something about it.” 

“Wfiat?” sfie snapped. 

“Do you fiave any feeling left 
in your fingers? If you do, see 
wfiat you can make of tfiese 
knots on my wrist.” 

“Tfiey feel just like a mess of 
twisted ropes,” sfie said. 

“Feel tfiem some more,” fie 
urged. “Try to become familiar 
witfi tfiem, tfie way tfiey twist and 
turn under eacfi otfier. Memorize 
tfiem witfi your fingers. Visualize 
tfiem in your mind.” 

“I’m doing it,” sfie said. 

“Tfiese men were soldiers, and 
tfie army teacfies its soldiers tfiat 
tfiere’s only one rigfit way to tie 
a knot. See if you can find a rope 
end.” 

“I’ve got it.” 

“Does it go under another 
rope?” 

“Yes.” 



“Then pull on it, firmly and 
steadily, and pray.” 

Tfie pilgrim felt tfie tug of tfie 
rope, felt it loosening, and tfien 
fiis Hands were free. “Good,” fie 
wfiispered. He sat up and undid 
tfie ropes around fiis ankles and 
tfien turned to tfie girl. 

Voices came from tfie next 
room. 

’’The iron’s ready. Get tfie old 
man.” 

Tfie pilgrim felt tfie rope give 
under his tugging. And tfien tfie 
girl struggled, and tfie rope tight- 
ened again. He slapped Ker on 
tfie sfioulder. “Quiet!” 

Anotfier voice said, “I ■ can’t 
wake him up.” 

Tfie ropes around tfie girl’s 
wrists fell away, and sfie was 
trying to get up and Kop toward 
tfie door. Tfie pilgrim pulled at 
fier bound legs and caugfit fier 
as sfie fell, one Band clasped 
across fier moutfi. Sfie struggled 
in fiis arms. 

Tfie first voice spoke again. 
“He’s not asleep. He’s dead. 
Cold.” 

Tfie girl stopped struggling. 

“Now get tfiose ropes off your 
legs,” tfie pilgrim said, releasing 
fier. 

He moved to tfie door, catcfiing 
Kimself as fiis rigfit leg, asleep, 
almost crumpled under him. He 
stood by the door, smelling tfie 
wood smoke, flexing his fingers 
and wiggling fiis toes.

“Maybe the girl knows some- 
thing.’’ 

“If she does, she won’t tell you. 
She’s the most stubborn girl I 
ever saw.” 

“Well, let’s get rid of tEe pil- 
grim, take the girl, and get out 
of Here.” 

TSe door opened and firelight 
spilled into the room, exposing 
the girl where she sat struggling 
with the ropes around her legs. 
'She looked up, blinking, and the 
one called Jones stepped into 
the room, peering about. “The 
damned pilgrim’s gone,” he called 
back over his shoulder, and the 
pilgrim hit him and then caught 
the Handle of his sword as he 
fell to the floor. 



nphe deserter known as Sam al- 
ready was running forward, 
and the pilgrim did not under- 
estimate his speed this time. He 
lunged with the sword’s point 
and caught him in mid-stride. 
The dull, sleepy eyes looked down 
at the blade stuck in His chest, 
and the body crumpled at the 
knees and fell forward. 

The pilgrim wrenched the 
sword free as it fell and continued 
his lunge in two swift steps across 
the floor. He cut down the de- 
serter by the fireplace who was 
holding a hot poker in his Hand. 
That was the one who Had clung 
to the girl. 

The pilgrim looked to the left. 
The quiet-voiced leader was 




standing in the doorway, his 
sword in one hand, the doorframe 
in the other. He had a bandage 
around his head. “Not this time, 
pilgrim,” he said. “I’m not my- 
self.” And he disappeared into 
the night. 

The pilgrim turned to follow. 
As he turned he felt a blow to 
his right arm. It stung, and he 
turned, tossing the sword to 
his left hand, to find behind him 
the deserter called Jones, a knife 
upraised to strike again. 

The pilgrim cut him across the 
middle and dropped the sword to 
clutch his right upper arm. It had 
begun to bum, and he could feel 
the blood pour out of it hot and 
sticky. He squeezed it tight. 

“Well,” the girl said, standing 
in the doorway and looking at 
the bodies in the room, “you are 
a bloody pilgrim. Is violence your 
only calling?” 

The pilgrim looked at Her in- 
credulously, and then a wry smile 
began to curl the comers of his 
lips. Only the right side rose 
a little higher than the left and 
his smile looked more like a 
sneer. 

He wavered a little on Eis feet, 
looked around, and sat down 
heavily on a crude chair. The girl 
ran to the bunk to the right of 
the fireplace. She picked up the 
hand of her dead father, held it, 
looked into his face, and turned 
back to the pilgrim.

“The sly one got you, didn’t 
he,” she said. She came to hind 
and pried his fingers away from 
the wound and spread apart the 
hole in the rough shirt he wore 
under his robe. “It’s an ugly 
wound.” She rummaged in a cab- 
inet in the comer and came back 
with a strip of white clotli, 
“Here,” she said, binding it tight- 
ly around the arm. 

The pilgrim felt a little dizzy. 
“Now get up,” the girl said 
briskly, “and let’s get you to a 
witch-doctor. He can give you 
some powders and have that sewn 
up so it will heal within a week. 
Come on, now. Don’t fall back.” 
The pilgrim stood, swaying. 
“How far is it?” 

“Only five miles,” she said, 
and caught him before Ee sank 
back into the chair. 

Ill 

'T'he trip through the dark for- 
est was a nightmare of 
pain and fatigue and dimming 
consciousness, but at the end 
of it was light and warmth and 
comfort. 

The witch-doctor’s villa looked 
small from a distance because 
it was lighted at night, as was 
the silolike chapel behind it. Up 
close, however, the villa seemed 
much larger, and inside it seem- 
ed interminable. 

It had an odor all its own, a 
GALAXY 



blend of antiseptics, sometEing 
that smelled like — the pilgrim 
could find no word for it but 
“energy” — and a trace of oil. 

“Come in, SusannaH,” tEe 
witch-doctor said after tEe door; 
Had announced tEem. “Come in, 
son, and let’s Eave a look at that 
arm.” 

Wordlessly, tEe pilgrim lield it 
out, winced as tEe witcE-doctor 
detacfied tEe girl’s bandage, bit 
his lower lip as tEe witch-doctor 
probed at it. But even in Eis pain 
the pilgrim was studying the 
man. 

TEe witcH-doctor was dark 
wEere tEe pilgrim’s mentor Ead 
been fair, and sliort where his 
mentor Ead been tall, but in 
spite of the difference they seem- 
ed as much alike as two men 
might be. There was about them 
an aura of inner certainty, as if 
tfiey Had arrived at an answer 
wEicE explained everything and 
they need question themselves 
no longer. Or perhaps, as the 
farmers thought, they were the 
favorites of the world’s unseen 
powers and, being all-powerful, 
could afford to be generous. 

“Come into the clinic,” tEe 
witcE-doctor said. “You, too, Su- 
sannaH. You’re a graduate and 
may see such things. And you, 
young man, are a pilgrim.” 

“Yes.” 

“WEere did you study?” 

“Near Denver.” 

WITCH HUNT 



“And wEo was your witch-doc- 
tor?” 

“He was tall and fair and wise. 
WlfcE-doctors have no names.” 
“Nor do pilgrims, and I will 
not ask yours.” 

The witch-doctor eased tEe 
pilgrim down flat on a table fash- 
ioned from some slick, dull-fin- 
ished metal the pilgrim had seen 
only in the witch’s villa near 
Denver. The witch-doctor eased 
Eis arm onto a shelf and brought 
forward from behind the table 
an object on wheels which fitted 
entirely over the arm. 

tCTt was a pity about your fa- 
-*■ tEer SusannaH,” the witcH- 
doctor said as his busy hands at- 
tached vinelike objects to various 
parts of the pilgrim’s body. 

“How did you know about my 
father?” 

“One never asks a witcfi-docfor 
How he knows.” But he smiled. 
‘We Have our ways. You’d bet- 
ter take one of those blue pills 
on the second sEelf there.” 
“Why?” the girl asked. 

“In my day, we used to call 
them ‘morning after’ pills. Take 
one. Those men didn’t hurt you, 
did tfiey?” 

“Them?” Her Head tossed 
scornfully. “It would take a 
hundred like them.” 

“Good. They can’t hurt you, 
not the real Susannah. Now 
young man, I can’t say this won’t 

21 



Kurt at all, but it won’t Kurt 
mucK.” He pressed a button. 
Something buzzed. You’re in good 
shape. But it will take a little 
more time for you to recuperate. 
How long Have you been on your 
pilgrimage?” 

“Three months.” 

“And what Have you learned 
thus far.” 

“I Have not yet found the 
truth, but I Have learned that 
people are pretty much the same 
all over, some good, some bad, 
some kind, some ftruel. They all 
want something, and if they want 
it too much, they turn bad, and 
if they don’t want anything very 
much they are the prey of those 
who do.” 

“You Have learned a good deal. 
How would you change the world 
to make it better?” 

“You must Have more of every- 
thing, so people’s wants can be 
more easily satisfied, or you have 
to rule more firmly so that evil 
is deterred.” 

“And suppose there was a place 
where there was more of every- 
thing, but it was a place that 
took a great deal of getting used 
to — a place where not every- 
body could live?” 

The pilgrim hesitated. 

“That’s easy,” Susannah said. 
“You let those live there who 
can adjust to it ” 

“And rule everybody else more 
firmly,” the pilgrim finished. 

22 



“A remarkable combination,” 
the witch-doctor said. “There — 
your arm is ready.” He pulled 
back the object on wheels. 

nphe pilgrim lifted his arm. The 
-*■ pain was gone, there was a 
new bandage on the wound, and 
the bleeding liad stopped. But 
his head swam as he sat up. 

“I’ll take you home,” the 
witch-doctor said. And he usher- 
ed them through the seemingly 
interminable villa which always 
gave the pilgrim the impression 
that it had subterranean powers 
beneath’ it that throbbed just be- 
low the level of audibility. And 
finally they came to a brightly 
lighted room in which sat a min- 
iature version of the farmer’s 
truck except that it was slimmer. 

The witch-doctor and Susan- 
nah Helped the pilgrim into a 
front seat and then got in on 
either side .of him. In front of 
them a wall opened up and with 
a quick roar and a whoosh of 
air the witch’s broom took off 
for a quick ride through the dark 
paths of the forest. 

As they left the clearing in 
which the witch-doctor’s villa 
was located, the pilgrim turned 
to take one last look. The villa 
stretched across between the 
trees, and the tall, pointed chapel 
was behind 

“What do you see?” asked the 
witch-doctor. 



GALAXY 



“An enigma,” Hie pilgrim said 
and was silent. 

At tfie cabin, the witch-doctor 
and SusannaH Helped tKe pilgrim 
get out and into a bunk. He was 
asleep almost before His Head 
touched tEe com-sKuck mattress. 
Minutes later — or perEaps it 
was Hours — He was awakened by 
someone entering tEe House. He 
felt for His staff and found noth- 
ing. He turned on His side and 
groaned as His arm stabbed him 
with pain. Then lie opened His 
eyes and saw SusannaH. She was 
standing in front of tEe fire, lean- 
ing on a shovel and gazing into 
the flames. 

“Wliere Have you been?” 

“Outside.” 

“What have you been doing?” 

“Burying,” she said. 

And He nodded and turned on 
His back and went to sleep again. 

A week later his arm Had Eeal- 
ed. He could swing it freely 
without pain, and there was only 
a pink scar wliere the knife 
wound Had gaped. TEe pilgrim 
walked out into the clearing and 
stretched in the sunshine. 

“You’re well,” said tEe girl, be- 
hind him. 

The pilgrim nodded. “Time to 
continue my pilgrimage.” 

“That’s what pilgrims must 
do,” she said. 

The pilgrim wondered if there 
was a note of wistfulness in Her 

WITCH HUNT 



voice. If there was He would ig- 
nore it. SKe had been pleasant 
enough during tfieir seven days 
together. SEe Had cooked tHeir 
meals, cleaned the cabin, tended 
to His wound, Hoed tEe garden. 
And sHe Had Hummed as she did 
these things. It was all too cozy. 

TEe pilgrim did not trust any- 
one, particularly women who 
enjoyed labor. They must Have 
motives, He thought, and He 
suspected motives, even his own. 

He went to a nearby oak tree 
and cut Himself another green 
staff about six feet long. He Held 
it experimentally, His left Hand 
about a quarter of tHe way from 
the end, the right Hand about 
the middle, and maneuvered 
against a cottonwood sapling, 
ending with a solid and potenti- 
ally cripling blow to the sap- 
ling’s middle. 

He walked back toward Susan- 
naH, inspecting the staff for 
cracks and splinters, finding none. 

“Here’s your robe,” sHe said 
Holding it out. “I washed it for 
you. And Here’s some cEeese and 
fresh bread I baked this morning. 
You can eat it for your lunch 
wEeu you come to a quiet stream. 
If you go that way — ” SKe mo- 
tioned Her Head toward the far 
end of the clearing. “ — you’ll 
reach the interstate directly.” 

“TEat’s good,” the pilgrim said. 
“I’m grateful to you for nursing 
me and taking care of me.” He 

23 



slipped into the robe and once 
more felt like a pilgrim. 

“That was nothing,” she said. 
“You rescued me from the de- 
serters. You may even have saved 
my life.” 

“That wasn’t wfiat you said 
when we were tied up.” 

“You did that after we were 
tied up,” she said. “I don’t ap- 
prove of killing. None of our fam- 
ily ever approved of killing. I 
had a brother who became a pil- 
grim.” 

“You never heard from Him?” 
She shook her head. “Either He 
found truth or death found him. I 
like to think he found truth.” 

“If he had, wouldn’t He Have 
come back to tell you?” 

“No pilgrim evet returns.” 

nphe pilgrim was anxious to He 
away, but somehow He felt 
that he hadn’t acted sufficiently 
grateful or sufficiently concerned 
about her welfare. “What will 
you do now?” 

She sighed. “I thought you’d 
never ask.” She reached behind 
the door to bring out a gray 
robe with a cowl. “I’ve decided to 
be a pilgrim, too. I’m going with 
you.” 

“That’s impossible.” 

“Nothing is impossible in this 
wonderful world.” 

“OH, I’ve heard of woman pil- 
grims, but never a man and wom- 
an together.” 

24 



“I could cook and wash for us 
both, and you could find food, 
and we would have more time 
for seeking truth. We would find 
it that much sooner.” 

He shook His Head. “Pilgrims 
travel alone. And even if they 
didn’t, I travel alone. And even 
if I didn’t, I wouldn’t want to Be 
responsible for you.” 

“I need nobody’s Help.” she 
said. “I’m responsible for myself.” 
“Stay here” the pilgrim said. 
“Or go to the witch-doctor and 
ask him what you should do.” 
“He said I could be a pilgrim. 
He said I should go with you.” 
“Go ahead then. Be a pil- 
grim! But be one somewhere 
else!” The pilgrim turned and 
walked briskly toward the fan 
end of the clearing and strode 
into the forest. 

He Had not walked far when 
He came to the highway again. 
He thought of it as a friend He 
Had not seen for a long time. He 
began to walk along it heading 
east breathing the winy air and 
enjoying the morning sun. But 
after a few minutes He Had an 
uneasy feeling in his shouldeii 
blades and looked back. Follow- 
ing him was another gray-robed 
figure. 

He waited for Susannah to ap- 
proach. “I thought I told you not 
to follow me” He said. 

“No you didn’t. WKat you said 
was. ‘Be a pilgrim somewhere 

GALAXY 



else.’ And tHat’s where I am — 
somewhere else.” 

“Then I’m telling you now. 
Don’t follow me.’ 

“A pilgrim must go where His 
conscience leads Him. My con- 
science tells me to follow this 
road for now.” 

The pilgrim turned and walk- 
ed briskly away. He kept up a 
good pace for as long as He could 
and, then stopped to pant. He 
glanced back. The girl was only 
a few paces behind, and she was 
not even breathing Hard. 

The pilgrim turned and walked 
on at a more normal pace. A lit- 
tle past noon by the sun, he came 
to a stream and stopped to drink 
from his cupped Hand, took tHe 
bread and cheese out of an inside 
pocket of His robe, unwrapped 
it, and began to eat. He ignored 
the girl wKo, ten feet away, was 
going through tlie same ritual. 
When he finished he HrusHed 
away the crumbs, drank again, 
stood up, and walked on. THe 
girl took up Her place again, ten 
paces behind him. 

A ll afternoon the pilgrim had 
the feeling that the girl’s 
gaze was burning itself into His 
shoulder blades. He Had the self- 
conscious urge to shift His back, 
and only the strongest of will 
power kept it still. That was pain- 
ful. 

In the early afternoon they 
WITCH HUNT 



came to a village — no more than 
a dozen buildings clustered on 
the near side of the road. Beyond 
were level fields, turned now in 
the spring for the planting of corn 
and vegetables. In some of the 
fields the winter wheat was up, 
a shimmering green across the 
land. In a distant field a truck 
was spreading witch powder to 
enrich tHe soil or to kill weeds or 
pests, and in another a truck 
was pulling a cultivator. 

There was a scattering of peo- 
ple in the village, dressed in work- 
ing clothes still stained from the 
fields or tHe household chores. 
They were talking to eacH other 
or bartering idly for goods. No 
coins changed Hands. In all such 
villages, the pilgrim Had never 
seen any coins. He Had asked why 
this was so — and he Had been 
told; everyone answers tHe ques- 
tions of a pilgrim for in what they 
say He may find truth. THat what 
they did not have, tHe Emperor 
could not take away. Besides, 
bartering was their pleasure. 

Now they called to the girl. 
"Susannah’, you are a pilgrim 
now.” 

“I heard about your father, 
Susannah. SucH a pity.” 

“Stop and stay a spell, Susan- 
nah. We’d be proud to Have you.” 
And to the pilgrim, they said, 
“Welcome, pilgrim. Stop with us. 
Share our evening meal.” 

Then the pilgrim turned the 

25 



comer of a building and saw be- 
side it a Eorse-drawn cart. TKe 
cart was filled with cabbages and 
beets and apples, carrots and 
sacks of grain and potatoes, and 
a pig. Beside the cart stood a 
sweating sergeant and behind Kim. 
seven soldiers, each with Els 
arms filled witE produce. 

“But we don’t want your food,” 
the sergeant was protesting to a 
villager who kept trying to tErust 
upon him a clucking chicken. 
“We want gold, coins, whatever 
you Eave. We don’t have room 
for all this food. We would Eave 
to walk, and my soldiers must be 
ready to fight at all times.” 
“Sir,” said the villager, Sis 
wEite hair shining in the sunlight, 
“we Have no gold. The last of 
the Emperor’s soldiers through 
Sere but one took all our remain- 
ing ornaments, although many of 
them were only brass, and now 
we Have only food. But you are 
welcome to that and more. 
Please take this chicken with our 
best wishes. Take Her to the Em- 
peror. She will make a good meal 
for him with dumplings.” 

nphe sweating sergeant caught 
sight of the pilgrim. “Pilgrim, 
maybe you can make him under- 
stand. Tell this poor savage that 
we can’t take the food.” 

“What brings you Here, ser- 
geant?” asked the pilgrim. 
“Chasing four deserters,” the 
26 



sergeant said. “But we were told 
to collect taxes on our way, as 
usual. Have you seen them? The 
deserters?” 

“Yes. I killed three of them.” 

“You killed three of them?” 
The chicken dropped out of the 
sergeant’s hands. It ran off to join 
its flock, gabbing about its re- 
prieve. 

“There was a big one, a rough 
one, a sly one, and a quiet one. 
I killed the first three. The quiet 
one got away.” 

Why did you kill them?” 

“They attacked me.” 

“You’re a mighty lethal pil- 
grim. You’ll have to come with 
us. Men, get that stuff out of the 
cart. We’re going to take this 
one in.” 

“It’s unlawful to interfere with 
a pilgrim,” the pilgrim said. 

“Not when He’s committed 
murder, and it’s murder until 
those men were officially tried 
and convicted.” 

“Which you and your squad 
would do when you found them.” 

“But we didn’t find them, did 
we?” said the sergeant. “Besides, 
they’ll never believe us at head- 
quarters if we come back and 
tell them some pilgrim killed Sam 
and Jones and Upshaw. Not un- 
less we produce the pilgrim who 
said so.” 

“I like Sam,” said one of the 
soldiers. 

A small group of villagers Had

gathered around tKem. SusannaH 
pushed Her way tKrougH tKem. 
“you sBould take me, too. I’m a 
pilgrim.” 

“Did you kill anybody?” tlie 
sergeant asked wearily. 

“No, but tKey — attacked me, 
and tKat’s wKen tKe pilgrim — 
I’m a witness — ” 

“It doesn’t matter,” tKe ser- 
geant said. “We Haven’t got room 
for more tKan one prisoner.” 

“But I’m witB Kim,” SusannaH 
said. 

TKe sergeant looked at tKe pil- 
grim. He sKook His Head. 

SusannaH clung to tKe ser- 
geant’s arm. “You don’t under- 
stand. He saved my life and now 
He’s responsible for me.” 

“TKat’s a vicious philosophy,” 
tKe pilgrim said. 

Tlie sergeant flung Eer to tKe 
ground. “Get in,” Ee said to Kis 
men. TKey caugEt tlie pilgrim 
by* Kis arms and Helped Him into 
tKe cart and found places for all 
on benches along eacE side. TKe 
sergeant got into tKe seat in front 
and urged tKe Horse into motion, 
leaving beEind tKem a Heap of 
produce and a squealing pig. TKe 
cart turned rigEt and Headed east. 

After tKey Had traveled a mile 
or so down tKe road, tKe pilgrim 
looked back. TKe village Had dis- 
appeared but a small gray fig- 
ure was trudging after tKem. In 
anotEer Ealf-Kour tKe figure Bad 
disappeared. 

WITCH HUNT 



TDy mid-morning of tKe follow- 
■“-* ing day tKe Hard wooden 
benches Had become like flint be- 
neatK tKe pilgrim, and for tKat 
reason alone Ke wislied He had 
made an effort to escape during 
die nlgEt, even though Ke Kad 
been shackled to a snoring sol- 
dier on eitEer side as tliey slept. 

What kept tKe soldiers in con- 
dition to fight? 

They Kad been traveling on tKe 
BigH plains. Now they began to 
pass through a series of low hills. 
On one of tKem the pilgrim 
glimpsed a lone horseman sil- 
houetted against tfie sky. Wfien 
Be looked again, there were a 
dozen there. He pointed tKem out 
to tKe sergeant. 

“Luddites,” the sergeant said. 
“TKey won’t attack. TKey fear 
tfie Emperor’s wrath, and they 
know IBs guns. TKeyll wait for 
some lone traveler or some poor- 
ly armed group. Naked cowards!” 

They passed on, the Horse wea- 
rily pulling the Heavy cart as if 
it knew its fate and was resigned 
to it Over Kills and between hills 
they went until suddenly, as tKey 
were between two High stone hills, 
a metal fence rose up out of the 
ground in front of them to a 
Height of ten feet and tKen twenty 
feet. 

TKe Eorse braced Kis feet to 
Stop, but the weight of the cart 

27 



kept pushing him forward until 
the sergeant remembered to Help 
witK the brake. 

“Back!” He sKouted. “Every- 
body out and get turned around.” 
But by the time tHe cart was 
swung around, another metal bar- 
rier Had closed tfie way they had 
entered. 

“Everybody get their guns,” 
the sergeant shouted. “At the 
ready!” 

“If you reach for your guns,” 
said a clear voice from above, “I 
will Have to blow you out of 
there.” 

Everyone looked up. Seated In 
a chair supported over the road- 
way by a metal boom was a man 
In a white jacket or robe. It re- 
minded the pilgrim of tfie wfiite 
jacket worn by the witch-doctors, 
but it was fuller and longer. 

In front of the man was a board 
on wbicfi his hands rested. He 
wore on fiis face some glass ob- 
jects which magnified his eyes 
until fie looked like an owl. On 
fiis Head was a wfiite cap wfilcfi 
completely covered fiis Hair. 

“On tfie Kills beside you, you 
will notice are tfie mouths of in- 
struments of destruction,” tfie 
man said. “You will believe me if 
I tell you tfiat I Have but to press 
a button and those instruments 
of destruction will belcfi fire and 
steel into this small valley un- 
til there is nothing left of it. 
If, by cfiance, one of you might 
28 



make it to the barrier, you will 
find that something frightening 
and fatal will Happen. Like this!” 

TTe tossed fiis Hand toward the 
■®- barrier tfie cart faced. A 
lengtfi of something metallic flew 
through tfie air and struck tfie 
fence. It flared brightly, melted, 
and fell in separate pieces to tfie 
ground. 

“You are frightened by tfiis 
new force, right?” said tfie man in 
the chair above tfiem. 

“A Neo-Scientist!” the sergeant 
said. 

“You are correct. And one day 
my colleagues and I will be great- 
er than the scientists of old, who 
called this energy in the barriers 
‘electra-city.’ Now, throw your 
weapons as far from you as you 
can.” 

The pellet guns flew in all di- 
rections. 

“Now the knives.” 

A few knives followed. 

“One by one you will climb 
the ladder which will descend 
to you.” Tfie Neo-Scientist’s 
hand pressed against tlie board in 
front of him, and a ladder un- 
coiled over the edge of the Kill. 
The sergeant went up first. At 
the top he Hesitated as if fie were 
deciding wfietfier to take fiis 
chances in tfie valley behind Him, 
took a deep breath, and went on. 
His soldiers followed Him. 

The Neo-Scientist turned to tfie 
GALAXY 



pilgrim. “It went very well, didn’t 
it? Everything worked perfectly. 
It was the first time, you know, 
so I couldn’t be sure. But it did 
go well. Didn’t it?” 

“Well, yes,” said the pilgrim. 

“Come up the ladder, then. 
You are different from the others. 
They are workers. That is their 
function. You are an educated 
man, a seeker after truth. That is 
your function. You could be a 
Neo-Scientist, if you wished. You 
are my guest. If you decide to 
join me and 1 explore the unknown, 
we will rejoice. If you wish to 
go on and find the truth in your 
way we will be sad for ourselves 
but Happy for you.” 

The Neo-Scientist pressed his 
board again, and the boom swung 
back behind the hilltop as the 
pilgrim climbed the ladder. When 
he reached the top, the Neo-Sci- 
entist was there to grasp his hand. 

The pilgrim stood up, stopped, 
and stared. Below him was a 
small city built on the edge of a 
bright lake. Smoke came curling 
from chimneys, people rode carts 
through the streets, and the carts 
Had no Horses pulling them, a 
big structure built of wood was 
drilling something into the earth, 
crews of men were building roads. 
It whs a lovely picture of civili- 
zation and industry, and the 
pilgrim blinked. He had thought 
that nothing like this existed on 
earth any more. 

WITCH HUNT 



“This,” the Neo-Scientist said* 
“is New Pittsburgh.” 
“Pittsburgh,” the pilgrim said, 
is a place in the Allegheny Re- 
public ruled by the Hereditary 
Governor of New York.” 

“Today it is a large village 
surrounded by ruins,” the Neo- 
Scientist said. “This is the New 
Pittsburgh 1 , which one day will be 
bigger and more prosperous than 
the old Pittsburgh.” 

A nd the pilgrim believed Kim 
until he looked down and 
saw the sergeant and the soldiers 
being fitted by white-coated men 
with metal collars fastened one 
to another by metal chains. 

“My own invention,” said the 
Neo-Scientist. “At any moment, 
those collars can be charged with 
a variable amount of electra-eity. 
A small amount and the collars 
only tingle: a warning. A larger 
amount and the collars shocks 
punishment. At the top limit they, 
can bum and kill: example. We 
have very obedient workers.” 

“I believe you,” the pilgrim 
said. “Do you Have many work- 
ers?” 

“Ten for every Neo-Scientist. 
In New Pittsburgh everyone has 
a job, a function. The Neo-Sci- 
entist’s job is to think, to explore, 
to invent, to make life easier and 
progress possible. The worker’s 
job is to provide the Neo-Scientist 
with the time to do things. Worn- 

25 



an’s job is to produce more Neo- 
Scientists and workers. If every- 
body does His job, everybody is 
happy.” 

“Can slavery work?” 

“If is: a Matter of function,” tHe 
Neo-Scientist said. “In nature 
everytHing Has a function. THe 
grass grows, tHe rabbit eats tfie 
grass, and tHe wolf eats tHe rab- 
bit. THe ants in tHe antHill, eacfi 
Has His job, and wfien all do tHeir 
jobs tHe antfiill thrives, and wfien 
the antfiill thrives all tfie ants in 
it are Happy. It is wfien man ig- 
nores function tfiat He becomes 
unhappy. 

“Besides, I am working on a 
brain operation wfiicfi will allow 
me to implant an electrode in tfie 
Happiness center. When a work- 
man does His job He will be allow- 
ed to stimulate Himself for an 
appropriate length of time.” 

“And wKat will Happen when 
tHe Emperor finds out about New 
PittsburgH?” 

“Do you diink His soldiers 
could stand up to my instruments 
of destruction — tfie electra-city, 
tfie big guns? Watcli.” He bent 
over tHe cKair in wfiicfi He Had 
been sitting and turned a knob. 
“Look toward tfie otfier Hill.” 
He pushed a button. THe black 
object exploded and produced a 
gout of red flame and black 
smoke. TKunder enveloped them. 

Something whistled into tHe 
distance. Something exploded 
30 



far above tfie distant hills. 

“And do you think fie could 
stand up to my workers, armed 
with! superior weapons and urged 
on by tHe stimulation of tHeir col- 
lars.” 

“Perfiaps not,” tfie pilgrim said. 
“But fie would try. And I know 
fie would give mucfi to gain con- 
trol of your weapons and your 
method of worker control.” 

“AH, but wfiat would fie do 
witfi them?” the Neo-Scientist 
asked. “He would only do more 
of wfiat fie does now: control 
more land, rule more people, 
Wfiat will tfiat prove?” 

“But wfiere does all of your 
work lead?” 

“To man’s destiny: tfie discov- 
ery of all truth’.” 

“Is that tfie witcfi-doctor’s 
truth?” 

“Tliey Have one trutfi. We Have 
many, as many as there once 
were people on this earth. Do 
you know Kow many people once 
lived on this world of ours?” 

He pilgrim sfiook His Head. 
“Four bilfion people lived on 
this earth because of the machine. 
THe entire world was like New 
Pittsburgh', filled witfi macfiines 
tfiat did all the labor. Then men 
fiad time to think and solve tfie 
mysteries of the universe. And 
they solved many of tfiem. We 
find bits and pieces of tfieir solu- 
tions that survived tfie time of 

GALAXY 




flames wKen the lowbrows re- 
belled and ran the eggheads, and 
tKe time of starvation and time 
of troubles that followed when 
almost four billkartrien and wom- 
en and children died of starvation 
and privation and violence. The 
old scientists thought they could 
just let people run loose, doing 
what they wished. See what Hap- 
pened! The machine was broken, 
and we Have this backward world 
which can support no more than 
100 million people or so. 

“But we can profit by the 
example of the past. We search 
the world for the science of the 
past and go on from what they 
learned to discover the truth of 
everything.” 

The Neo-Scientist clearly was 
serious. “That is a noble am- 
bition.” 

“It is a noble race.” 

The Neo-Scientist motioned 
the pilgrim to get into a small, 
open car with four seats in it. It 
rested on rails near the top of 
the hill. When they were both 
seated, the car began to move 
smoothly toward New Pittsburgh 
below. 

Tlie sergeant glanced at them 
as they departed. The pilgrim 
thought his eyes were haunted. 

“How do you determine who 
are workers and who are Neo- 
Scientists?” the pilgrim asked. 

“Everyone gets the same edu- 
cation until they are eleven. At 
WITCH HUNT 



eleven they take an aptitude ex- 
amination. The ones that pass go 
on to a Neo-Scientific education, 
as high as they can go. A few drop 
out along the way and become 
technicians. The rest are fitted 
with collars and put to work.” 
“That must be a moment of 
great terror.” 

“Not at all. What they dread 
more than labor is further educa- 
tion. Using their arms and backs 
comes more naturally to them 
than using their heads. Function!” 
By the time the car on rails 
had reached the outskirts of New 
Pittsburgh, the town did not look 
so attractive. The smoke from 
the chimneys Hung in ffie air, 
making breathing difficult, set- 
tling on the houses, dirtying roofs 
and clothing, peeling paint off the 
walls. The horseless carts were 
emitting choking fumes, as well. 
The roads were rutted and full of 
holes. Even the bright lake had 
a gray scum along its shore. It 
extended several hundred yards 
into the water. 

And the people who were work- 
ing did not look up as they pass- 
ed. 

A s they rolled through the town, 
the pilgrim’s impression of 
despair grew. At the end of the 
rails was a building faced with 
massive columns and twined with 
ivy. Rising from that base was a 
tall, white, windowless tower. 

31 



“Come,” said tfie Neo-Scientist, 
descending from: tHe veHicle. 

Tfiey went tfirougli broad doors 
and into a large, marbled lobby. 
Clerks rusfied up to tHe Neo-Sci- 
entist, waving messages at Him. 
Neo-Scientists came toward Hint 
in tfieir smocks, asking questions. 
He waved them all away. 

“We Have a guest,” fie said, 
“this earnest pilgrim wHo, like us, 
is seeking trutfi. Speak witfi Him, 
answer His questions, sHare your 
confidences and your thoughts 
with him as you would with me, 
and perhaps he will join us.” 

■Then the Neo-Scientist led the 
pilgrim to the far wall in which 
there were many doors. Tfie Neo- 
Scientist pressed a button. One 
of tfie doors opened. They enter- 
ed a little room. Wfien tfie door 
closed, the room began to move 
upward. Tfie pilgrim Had a feel- 
ing of greater weigHt, He count- 
ed twenty doors before tfie room 
stopped, the door in front of tliem 
opened, and they emerged into a 
spacious Hall, 

Tfie Neo-Scientist led Him to 
one end of the Sail, opened a 
door and showed tfie pilgrim in- 
to a comfortably fitted sitting 
room with an adjoining bedroom 
and batfi wfiicfi disposed auto- 
matically of waste fluids and oth- 
er materials. 

There were a few books in 
the sitting room dating back to 
before the time of burning, and 

32 



there was a mechanism whicfi fie 
could use to call for, food or com- 
panionship. 

“My rooms are at tfie otfier 
end of tfie Hall,” tfie Neo-Scien- 
tist said. 

It was a more astonisfiing 
building tfian tfie Emperor’s pal- 
ace in Denver and more luxuri- 
ously appointed. 

“Why do you build so fiigfi 
wfiere there is so mucfi land?” 
the pilgrim asked. 

“You ask good questions. That 
is a most promising sign in a 
young man. There are many rea- 
sons for building a tall building 
like this: first, it concentrates 
control and information process- 
es in a small space; second, it im- 
presses the people with tfie per- 
manence of their leaders; third, 
it pleases the populace like the 
pyramids of ancient Egypt or , 
the skyscrapers of ancient New 
York; fourth, it Has a virile 
symbolism; fifth, it inspires the 
occupants to strive Harder for 
understanding; and sixth, it places 
the leaders far from the scene of 
possible violence. There, I have 
been frank with you as I always 
Hope to be, and as I Hope you 
will be frank with me.” 

“I Hope to be.” 

“Now I have much work to do. 

If you need anything, just call in- 
to that instrument. And remem- 
ber: function!” And fie closed the 
door. 



GALAXY 



/Clearly, this was one possible 
answer to the riddle propos- 
ed by Susannah’s witch-doctor. 
This was a place where there was 
more of everything. It took some 
getting used to. He supposed that 
a lot of people could not live 
there; they would not like the tall 
building, and they would hate or 
not be able to tolerate the ma- 
chines. So the Neo-Scientists ad- 
justed to it, and everyone else 
was ruled firmly. 

But somehow the pilgrim did 
not think the witch-doctor was 
referring to New Pittsburgh. 

And he went over and put His 
Hand on the door, and the door 
would not open. 

It was locked. The pilgrim felt 
a moment of panic until he re- 
membered the mechanism on 
which he could call for food, and 
when he had eaten he called for 
companionship. When the young 
Neo-Scientist came He strolled 
the streets of New Pittsburgh with 
him, talking about the town and 
how it was to live there and sci- 
ence and the new life that was 
building. 

The pilgrim spent seven days 
in New Pittsburgh, talking, living 
a carefree, comfortable, intellectu- 
al life, and in spite of the obvious 
degradation of the many he could 
not help being fascinated by the 
equally obvious liberation of the 
thinking man to do that which 
makes man most human. 

WITCH HUNT 



Then he would watch the work- 
ers in their collars, and the mer- 
cenaries who acted as foremens 
over them, twisting the knobs ©IS 
their control sticks, and standbfi 
guard at the outskirts of toym. 

And the pilgrim could not help 
noticing that whenever he wag 
alone in his room the door was 
locked and whenever he was out- 
side the room someone was with 
him. After a little he began to 
wonder if he too did not wear a 
collar like the workers, only & 
had fashioned' it and put it ©d 
himself. 

On the evening of the seventh 
day, after dusk as he was walk- 
ing with one of the young Neo- 
Scientists, he talked with hint 
about the mysteries of the earth 
and about the mysteries of the 
sea, about the mysteries of Hite: 
air and the mysteries of life 
stars. He began to grow very ex- 
cited about the human adventure. 

In the distance came a chorus, 
of loud yells, and the pilgrim saw; 
a group of flickering lights. He 
Heard a thunder of hooves get- 
ting closer, and he wondered 
what new miracle New Pittsburgh 
was producing. 

V 

T Ee Hooves became separate 
Horses, tHe flickering lights 
became individual torches, and 
the yells parceled themselves out 

33 




among tfie individual tliroats of 
near-naked Luddites wlio were 
storming down the main street of 
New Pittsburgh. They tossed 
their torches into Houses, and th'e 
houses magically turned into 
flames, and the flames paint- 
ed the bodies of the Lud- 
dites. The Luddites leaned far 
over their Horses to club' down 
pedestrians in tKe street. They 
took particular delight In smit- 
ing a mercenary or a Neo-Scien- 
tist. And tEey swept up a few 
women to ride behind them.. 

Two of them saved their torch- 
es for the buildings adjoining the 
Neo-Scientist tower, and then it 
seemed as if the entire city had 
turned to fire and men and wom- 
en were running frantically back 
and forth in front of tKe flames, 
not knowing wKat to do. 

Everything Happened so quick- 
ly that tfie pilgrim did not Have 
time to evaluate His actions or 
reactions, and before He could 
do so a fiorse galloped so close 
by that Its sweat sprayed on Him, 
a strong arm closed around him 
under His arms, and suddenly 
he was sitting on the back of a 
wildly galloping Horse. 

He thought of struggling, but 
he looked back and saw that New 
Pittsburgh was doomed. Every- 
where it was burning, and even 
tfie tower of Neo-Science was in 
danger of being engulfed. Black 
figures were fleeing.

Tlie last vision of tSe city the 
pilgrim took witfi Him was of the 
sergeant and fiis squad of soldiers. 
Tlie sergeant Had found a saw, 
and lie was sawing away at the 
cHain that linked Kim to tfie next 
man. 

Tfie Korses ran long after tfiey 
Had swept into tfie outer darkness 
and tfie ruddy ligfit fiad faded 
into niglit befiind tfiem. Finally 
tfiey stopped and tfie pilgrim was 
allowed to slide, leg and bottom 
weary, to tfie ground. Tlie women 
were told to build a fire. Tfiey 
looked until tfiey found some twigs 
and many cow cfiips. Tfien tfiey 
were given grain and preserved 
meat out of leatfier pouches, and 
tfie Luddites produced a pot in 
wfiicfi to cook tfiem. 

npfie pilgrim fiad been sitting 
back in tfie shadows, but one 
Luddite noticed fiim and urged 
fiim to join tfie otfier women. 
He urged fiim witfi a brisk blow 
to the back of tfie Kead. Tfie pil- 
grim’s cowl fell back. 

“I’m not a woman,” tfie pil- 
grim said. 

“By damn, you’re not,” tfie 
Luddite exclaimed. “But you 
looked like a woman in that 
robe!” And fie readied for a knife 
in fiis belt. 

Tfie pilgrim fiit fiim just be- 
low fiis ribcase, and tfie Luddite 
grunted and doubled up. Tfie 
other Luddites laughed until tfiey 

WITCH HUNT 



rolled on tfie ground by tfie fire. 
“George and fiis woman!” tfiey 
sfiouted. “George’s woman Rag a 
kick like a mule.” 

Tfie Luddite began to straight- 
en up. He was still trying to get 
fiis knife out of fiis belt. Tfie pil- 
grim fiit fiim again in tfie same 
spot. Tfie Luddite sat down heav- 
ily, and fiis fellow Luddites broke 
into new screams of laugfiter. 

Finally tfie laugfiter began to 
subside. Tfie stricken Luddite 
slowly began to get to fiis feet, 
Holding fiis stomach and back- 
ing away. “Perfiaps we can reacfi 
an agreement,” fie said. “I do not 
kill you, and you do not fiit me.” 
“TKat’s fair,” tfie pilgrim said. 
One of tfie otfier Luddites call- 
ed out, “George, don’t you know 
tfie difference between a woman 
and a pilgrim.” 

“A pilgrim? Is tfiat wfiat tfiis 
is? I’ve Heard of them but I never 
saw one before.” 

“One of tfiem was in camp 
just a few days ago.” 

“I was out hunting witfi a 
bunch of tfie boys.” 

Looking around at tfie little 
group — there seemed to be no 
more than twenty-five Luddites, 
none injured ■ — tfie pilgrim was 
astonished tfiat so few fiad done 
so much 1 damage. 

After tfieir simple meal of por- 
ridge enricfied witfi bits of meat, 
tfiey sat around tfie campfire 
talking in loud voices about tfie 

35 



raid on New Pittsburgh, the de- 
struction they had wrought, and 
the mercenaries and Neo-Scien- 
tists they had killed. There was 
no remorse. 

"ITThen they had completed 
* ’ their boastful recounting of 
the evening’s action, one of them 
stood up and began to chant a 
song of ancient bravery, of blows 
struck and victories won, of Lud- 
dites fallen in battle taking their 
enemies with them, of machines 
broken and of one vast ma- 
chine that was stilled forever be- 
fore it made slaves of all man- 
kind. 

“Machines must di el” he chant- 
ed. “Science must die! All who 
fashion and create must die! Man 
must live! Nature must live! And 
the right way to live will live!” 

Later, as the talking died away, 
the pilgrim turned to the Luddite 
beside him. The Luddite smelled 
of smoke and grease and sweat, 
but the pilgrim was beginning to 
get accustomed to it. He supposed 
he was a bit gamy, himself. “Is 
that why you burned New Pitts- 
burgh?” 

“Was that the name of the 
place?” the Luddite said. It was 
George, his captor, who now had 
become his friend. “Well, it was 
for kicks, mostly,” he said. “That 
is the way most of us look at it. 
A few, they really got this thing 
about the machine. They really 
36 



go nuts about it. Not that we 
all don’t feel kind of that way. 
Every moral person does.” 

“I suppose so,” the pilgrim said. 
“You’ve got to be for it or 
against it. We take sacred vows 
to destroy any machine we find 
and anybody who builds ma- 
chines. You aren’t a Neo-Scien- 
tist, are you? You were in that 
town.” 

“I had been captured, just as 
you captured me. How do you 
feel about the witch-doctors?” 
‘They’re okay, I guess.” 

“Don’t they use machines?” 
“Naw,” the Luddite said, 
“They got powers just like our 
spiritualists. You know — they 
can make the wind blow, heal the 
sick, turn the land sweet for grow- 
ing things, bring the game, that 
sort of thing. It’s all in knowing 
the right way of doing things.” 

“I see,” the pilgrim said. 
“Anyway, we don’t see many 
witch-doctors.” 

Wrapped in blankets, lying on 
the sweet prairie grass that prick- 
led a little through the blanket, 
smelling the fresh prairie air and 
the last smoke from the campfire, 
seeing the stars wheel past, they 
fell asleep. 

I n the next few days, the pil- 
grim became a part of Lud- 
dite life on the move. Given a 
spare horse, he soon became ac- 
customed to riding it bareback, 

GALAXY 



Eis robe floating out behind liiffl 
like gray wings. 

Wfiere it was forested, tEey 
Eunted deer, waiting by streams 
until tEe spooky deer came step- 
ping ligEtly to tEe trickling wa- 
ter for a drink. TEey fisEed for 
trout and bass and pike and, best 
of all for eating cooked over tEe 
campfire, catfisE. And tEey cHas.- 
ed a giant Eerd of wild cattle, 
felling tEem with arrows and 
lances as tEey rode along beside 
tEe running, plunging beasts. Af- 
terwards, tired and dusty, tEey 
enjoyed a feast of steak and roast 
and liver and tongue cooked over 
giant fires and eaten until satia- 
tion; they slept and woke to eat 
again. 

It was a good, clean, manly 
life. Tlie pilgrim felt Eimself 
growing lean and strong. His face 
became bronzed like tKose of his 
captors; soon tEe only thing tEat 
distinguished Eim from tEem was 
tEe robe Ee wore and would not 
discard. TEis was tEe way a man 
was meant to live, Ee tHougEt. 

In tEe evenings, after tEe meals 
were completed and tEe women 
were eating, tEe Luddites would 
talk by tEe fire about tEeir ex- 
ploits or sometimes about life and 
God and tEe afteriife. Sometimes 
tEe minstrel would sing of old 
glories or glories yet to come, 
and tEe blood would dance within 
eacE Luddite until Ee was com- 
pelled to get up and stomp 
WITCH HUNT 



around tlie dying fire as tEe min- 
strel chanted, making guttural 
sounds and wEoops of otlier 
noises. 

And tEe minstrel Had made an- 
other song, a new song, about tEe 
burning of New Pittsburgh, and 
everyone sat quietly and listened. 

Sometimes tEe pilgrim would 
sEow tEem tricks tEat He Had 
learned — tEe boxing witE tEe 
fists, tEe shrewd blows witE tlie 
sides of tEe Bands or tEe finger- 
tips or tEe feet, tEe strange magic 
of tEe quarterstaff. 

And then tEere would be long, 
quiet nights under tEe stars, 
wrapped in a blanket, for think- 
ing or sleeping. 

PerEaps this was tlie life the 
witcE-doctor Had meant in Eis 
riddle. It was a most pleasant life. 
TEere was plenty of wEat every- 
body wanted. But anybody could 
learn to enjoy it; except tEat there 
could not be too many or tEere 
would' not be enough game or fisli 
for everybody. 

>Tplie lot of the captured Neo- 
Scientist women was not so, 
ideal. But tEey were a subdued 
group good for little more than 
doing wEat the Luddites told 
them to do, like gathering wood 
for fire, cooking meals, going witli 
tEe Luddite who selected them to 
Eis blanket for tEe nigHt. TEey 
did not complain mucE, However, 
although they got dirtier and 

37 



I 



greasier and more bedraggled 
each day. 

There was little spirit in them, 
the pilgrim thought. 

And finally, when the hunt 
was over the riders came one 
evening to an encampment 
where wicker huts were built 
beside a stream. The riders 
came thundering down from 
the hill and into the camp, shout- 
ing and screaming. Out of the 
wicker huts came the women and 
children and old men and a few 
young men as well. They sur- 
rounded the newcomers with out- 
bursts of joy and questions about 
the hunt. 

“Later,” George said. “Later 
at the campfire we will tell it all, 
the whole glorious tale. The min- 
strel has made a new song about 
our great feats of strength and 
guile and courage. It is a song 
that will live among the Luddites 
as long as there are minstrels 
with a voice to sing.” 

The pilgrim looked around for 
the other pilgrim and thought he 
saw a gray robe in the distance. 
While he was looking he thought 
he saw another familiar face, but 
he could not remember where he 
had seen it before. 

So it was that the story was 
told at the campfire, after the 
feast on the meat the group had 
brought back from their hunting, 
and the singing and dancing went 
on long after the sun had set. 
33 



But not for the pilgrim. In the 
crowd that spilled from the Euts 
he had reached where the other 
pilgrim went, and now he sought 
pilgrim out. 

H e pushed back a hood and 
said, “Susannah!” 

“It’s me,” she said, “wearily 
wipping one greasy hand across 
her forehead. 

“What are you doing here?” 
“Taking meat to the men.” 

“I mean in this camp.” 
“Seeking truth, and it is not 
here.” 

“You look thinner. Have you 
been sick?” 

“Only of these savages. You’d 
look thinner, too, if the old wom- 
en and the old men and the young 
men, too, beat you out of bed 
in the morning and sent you off 
to the fields to plant com and po- 
tatoes with a crooked stick, shoo 
the birds away from the growing 
plants, pull weeds by hand, cook 
meals, wash clothes on a rock, and 
then be hauled off to a filthy 
blanket by one of these greasy 
pigs. But you seem to be doing 
well for yourself.” 

“I must admit I have found it 
a good life,” the pilgrim said. 

“It’s a great life for the men. 
For the women’s drudging from 
dawn to the middle of the night.” 
One of the Luddite men danced 
by. “You want that woman? You 
can Have her. No good for work, 

GALAXY 



no good for sleeping with 1 . Wear 
yourself out beating Her and still 
she fights like a wild animal. 
You take Eer. SSe wears a robe 
like yours.” 

“There,” tEe pilgrim said. “Now 
you are mine, and I will set you 
free.” 

“A great lot of good tEat will 
do me,” Susannah said. “If I try 
to get out of here, someone else 
will grab me, and if I don’t I’ll 
Have to work like the others or 
the Luddites will be turning on 
you, and I’ll still have to work 
like the others.” 

“I suppose they couldn’t have 
a double standard. Well, come 
with me. We’ll find a spot to roll 
out a blanket and at least you 
can get a good night’s sleep.” 

“I’d like to take a bath,” she 
said. 

“Don’t they let you bathe?” 

“When would I find time?” 

“We’ll both bathe. I Haven’t 
found time either. Where is a 
good spot?” 

“Below tEe camp the stream 
has been damned by beavers. 
TEere’s a pool. We wash the 
clotEes there.” 

Tn a few moments they were 
-**- splashing in the pool togeth- 
er in the dark, rubbing themselves 
with sand and ducking their 
heads under to get the dirt and 
lice out of their Hair. 

When Susannah got out of the 
WITCH HUNT 



pond, the pilgrim was shocked 
to see by the distant firelight 
how thin she was and tEe bruises 
on her back and legs. He wrapped 
Her in her robe and put on his 
own robe and found a level spot 
to spread his blanket. They lay 
down together on it, and He put 
his arm around her for warmth’. 

“You Have had it tough.” 

For the first time since He Had 
met her she was silent. She put 
Her Head against his chest. Her 
body quivered. After a few mo- 
ments the pilgrim realized that 
she was crying. He had Had many 
experiences in this world, but he 
had seldom been alone with a 
crying woman and never with a 
woman who sobbed silently. He 
didn’t know what to do. He pat- 
ted Her on the shoulder and said, 
“There, there.” And wEen that 
seemed too paternal, he smoothed 
her short-cropped hair, noticing 
for the first time that she had cut 
it off. “It must Have been terri- 
ble!” He said. 

She cried Harder, but eventu- 
ally she quieted. The shoulder of 
his robe was soaked with Her 
tears, but Ee let Her remain where 
she was. Presently Her growing 
warmth and lier proximity began 
to work upon the pilgrim a famil- 
iar magic. 

“OH, Hell,” she said. “You’re 
like all those other savages.” 

The pilgrim protested, “I Eave 
not done anything.” 

39 



“It’s obvious what you’re think- 
ing. When you asked me to share 
your blanket, I thought you 
wanted me to get a good night’s 
sleep.” 

“I did. Believe me. But you’re 
so warm. I can’t control my re- 
actions, but I can control my 
actions. You have nothing to fear 
from me. An unwilling woman is 
not my idea of — ” 

“Oh, shut up!” she said, and 
she kissed him, and one thing led 
to another. 

Tn the morning as the sun daz- 
zled his eyes, the pilgrim 
awoke to find himself alone in 
the blanket. His clothing was 
gone, even his robe, and He Had 
only the blanket to cover His nak- 
edness. He felt around in tKe 
grass and found a wide, cotton 
belt. He strapped it around His 
middle and, wrapping Himself in 
the blanket, went to tKe stream. 

He found Susannah taking a 
blue pill out of a bag Hung around 
her neck and popping it into Her 
mouth!. When sKe noticed Him, 
she said, “I took a Handful at the 
witch-doctor’s while I was about 
it. I guess you think that’s a 
terrible thing for a girl to do.” 

“Well, I guess not,” the pil- 
grim said. “I mean, it’s thinking 
ahead or — Anyway, it’s none of 
my business.” He stooped to 
drink. 

SusannaH said, “I’d advise you 

40 



to drink above the camp. TKe 
Luddites throw all tHeir garbage 
and other wastes into the stream. 

She was beating his clothing 
between two stones. Her own 
clothes, still wet, were on her. “I 
thought you hated this kind of 
drudgery.” 

“It’s not drudgery when you 
are doing it for somebody you 
like. Besides, if I wasn’t washing 
clothes somebody would be beat- 
ing me to work at something for 
them.” 

Turning his back, he slipped 
into his wet clothing and robe. 

“It’s a little late for modesty, 
isn’t it?” she asked. 

TKe pilgrim did not answer. He 
walked off in dignity, shivering, 
toward the camp. When he had 
drunk at the stream above the 
camp and picked up a couple of 
stray bones with meat on them to 
gnaw upon, he returned to the 
spot where he had left Susannah. 
But on the way he met an old 
woman who was whipping Susan- 
nah’s legs with a bundle of 
switches and pointing off toward 
the fields. 

“Stop that!” said the pilgrim. 
“This is my woman.” 

“Shameless man!” said the old 
woman. “Letting woman idle. 
Idle woman is evil woman. So 
say the wise men.” 

“Don’t interfere,” Susannah 
said. 

He trotted along beside her. 

GALAXY 



“WHat do you mean, don’t inter- 
fere?” 

“You must work within tHe 
system.” Susannah scampered to 
keep afiead of the switches. “You 
can’t figKt it. Find out how it 
works, and then you can make 
it work for you. I’m going! I’m 
going!” 

/ T'Ke pilgrim searched out the 
Luddite named George. “Say, 
George,” He said, “I want the 
pilgrim woman.” 

“Fine,” George said. “You take 
Ker tonight.” 

“You don’t understand. I want 
Her every night — and every day, 
too.” 

“That’s not the way it works 
Here,” George said patiently. “Ev- 
ery woman is any man’s woman. 
No favorites. No jealously. No 
quarrels. Share and share alike. 
You have her one night; I can 
Have Ker another night. Good sys- 
tem.” 

“But,” the pilgrim said, “I — 
want her — for myself!” 

“Well, you can’t have her and 
that’s tKat!” 

A group of young Luddite men 
had gathered around the discus- 
sion, drawn by tHe straining 
voices. “WHat’s the matter Here, 
George?” asked the one who look- 
ed familiar to the pilgrim. 

“This character wants a wom- 
an all his own,” George said. 

“How many do I Have to fight?” 
WITCH HUNT 



“Are you some kind of spy?” 
George said. “We take you in, we 
treat you nice, and now you want 
to change tKe way we do things. 
Just like tHat! THe old ways ain’t 
good enougH for you. Are you a 
Neo-Scientist after all?” 

“All I want is the girl,” the 
pilgrim said, looking around. But 
he wasn’t quick anougH. The club 
Hit him on the back of the Head 
before He quite got the word ‘girl’ 
out of His mouth. But fie saw the 
man who Hit Kim, and at tHat 
moment He recognized wfio it 
was. It was the quiet deserter 
from Susannah’s clearing. 

T Te woke up witfi a frigfitful 
^ -*■ headache and someone tug- 
ging at his Hands beKind Kis back. 
They were tied togetHer, but as 
he realized that fact Kis Hands fell 
apart, and He sat up. 

A Hand came over His mouth. 
He raised his Hands. THe Hand 
on his mouth was a small, sfiapely 
Hand. “It’s me, Susannah,” a 
voice whispered in His ear. “We 
Have got to try to escape. To- 
night. They’re going to kill you. 
Slowly. WitK ceremony. That’s 
their way. Come on.” 

They slipped througfi a slit in the 
back of the hut and crawled un- 
til tfiey thought tKey were out of 
earsKot and then got up and be- 
gan to run. TKey ran for a long 
time, stumbling occasionally in 
the nigHt, and threw themselves 

41 



down to rest and got up to run 
some more. 

During tKe second rest Susan- 
nah said, “We’d better split up, 
I tliink we’d Have a better chance 
of getting away.” 

“No!” tlie pilgrim said. “We 
foots make it or neither of u§ 
makes it.” 

“TGat’s an idiot’s cBoice,” Su- 
sannah said scornfully. “I’m not 
thinking of you. “I’m thinking of 
me.” 

TKe pilgrim could not tliink of 
an answer. 

TKey separated for tKe next to 
the last time. 

VI 

A s tKe cart jostled through tKe 
rutted streets of Lawrence 
with tKe ball of orange witcK fire 
perched on the right front post 
and the soldiers eyeing it furtive- 
ly, the pilgrim thought over tKe 
events of the past six months 
since he had begun his pilgrimage 
from a village not far from Den- 
ver. 

He had seen the way people 
lived. He had seen many kinds of 
people and many kinds of peo- 
ples. He had known the life of 
a wanderer, and along His way He 
had met other unKappy, dispos- 
sessed persons. All the others, in 
their way, were happy or at least 
had something to recommend 
the way they lived. 

42 



The Neo-Scientists enslaved 
others but dreamed about the 
stars and the mysteries of life. 
TKe Luddites Kad a wild and 
wonderful existence free of most 
ordinary cares, but their life was 
only for men and it was always 
the same, one day to another. 
Maybe that was the way life was 
meant to be, the pilgrim thought. 

TKe Empire was a joke. It did 
not seem like a joke when one was 
part of the court or near the im- 
perial seat where the Emperor’s 
word was absolute. But beyond 
a radius of twenty-five to fifty 
miles people lived pretty much as 
tKey chose. 

TKen there were the villagers, 
most of them farmers. There 
probably were more of them than 
of any other kind. They raised 
tKeir crops and their livestock, 
they went to the schools provided 
by the witch-doctors, occasionally 
a bright youngster would go off 
on a pilgrimage and never come 
back, and they were under the 
protection of the powerful but 
uncommitted witch-doctors. 

TKe witch-doctors were the 
key to the situation, as the pil- 
grim analyzed it. TKey held pow- 
er but they did not use it. They 
did not interfere. They helped 
when they were asked. They 
taught. They gave advice. They 
provided what was good for the 
body, good for tKe soil, good for 
the livestock, good for the mind. 

GALAXY 



Maybe. But they did not inter- 
fere. They let people Mil each 
oilier if tliey wanted to, love each 
other if tfiat was the way their 
tastes inclined. 

Tlie pilgrim Bad never known 
them to lie, personally or through 
their teaching devices which gave 
answers and asked questions 
tfirougfi some strange magic, just 
like a person. Occasionally botR 
said things that were enigmatic 
or incompreHensible. Sometimes,; 
later, some of tfiese statements 
might make sense when lie Bad 
learned something else. 

r jplie question: where did tEe 
1 ^ witch-doctors get tlieir pow- 
ers? Did they, in reality, have 
some magic formula which 
brought natural forces under 
their command, some interces- 
sionary power with the spirit 
world, if there was a spirit world? 

Or, the pilgrim thought, were 
the witch-doctors like the Neo- 
Scientists? Were their powers 
completely natural, though be- 
yond the scope of ordinary man, 
rather than super natural? Did 
they manufacture and control 
machines? 

If this was so, and the pil- 
grim was beginning to think that 
it was, why were witch-doctors 
not set upon and destroyed by 
the Luddites and every other 
right-thinking person who re- 
membered the time of starvation 
WITCH HUNT 



and the time of troubles? Both 
Had been caused by the machine 
and the century during which it 
ruled the world. Why were they 
not killed like the occasional, 
aberrant Neo-Scientists wBo arose 
and Had their brief day and were 
destroyed? 

One reason: they did not glory 
in their machines like tEe Neo- 
Scientists; tBey built no monu- 
ments. Another reason: they did 
not explain; they called it magic. 

Magic is acceptable; science is 
detestable. 

There was one catch: what did 
the witch-doctors gain by it? The 
pilgrim’s excitement faded. There 
must be a profit; there must be a 
motive. Were the witch-doctors 
satisfied merely to do good so 
that others might live better lives? 
Did they get their return from 
the gratitude and admiration of 
the people, from their sacred po- 
sitions, from the power to teach 
and preach? The pilgrim shook 
his head. Such saintliness was be- 
yond belief. None of those mo- 
tives were enough, not for Him 
and not for any man, much less 
the thousands scattered in their 
villas across this empire and per- 
haps, who knows, across other 
lands as well, even to the myste- 
rious Russias and the Chinas 
across the oceans that no one 
Had Heard from since the time of 
troubles. 

And then the pilgrim’s elation 

43 ' 



arose again. Perhaps the answer 
to the question of motivation was 
a second truth', or a complemen- 
tary part of the first truth, and 
when one had learned this, one 
had learned the truth that one 
became a pilgrim to find. 

Because there was, in the tra- 
dition of the pilgrim itself, some 
kind of return. This was, the 
witch-doctors said, the only way 
to become a witch-doctor. If you 
became a pilgrim and learned the 
truth, you became a witch-doctor. 

Therefore — a pilgrim is a 
witch-doctor’s way of making an- 
other witch-doctor, just as an egg 
is a chicken’s way of making an- 
other chicken. But equally as 
true, a chicken is an egg’s way of 
making another egg, and isn’t 
therefore a witch-doctor . 

That was the wrong track. The 
question: what do witch-doctors 
do? They serve, said the witch- 
doctors. But that led back only 
to the village where the process 
began again. Do witch-doctors do 
anything else? Yes. They must. 
But if so, wh'at — and where? 

nphe pilgrim would have liked 
-*• to pursue this line of reason- 
ing farther, because He thought it 
was getting him somewhere, but 
the cart jerked to a halt. 

“Out, pilgrim!” said the ser- 
geant. 

The pilgrim remembered an- 
other sergeant and wondered 

44 



where he was now with his squad. 
He looked around. The city hall 
was an old brick and stone build- 
ing. It must have been old at 
the time of starvation, the pil- 
grim thought, but it had survived 
the time of troubles better than 
newer structures, and its brick 
tower still ascended high above 
its stone front steps. 

“Up! Go on up!” the sergeant 
said, yanking his arm. “The cap- 
tain’s waiting for you.” 

The pilgrim shrugged and 
walked up the worn steps and 
through two curious wrought- 
iron doors and up another short 
flight to a large room with tall 
windows on either side. All the 
windows but one had been brok- 
en many years ago and had been 
boarded up, but one miraculous 
window still admitted light. In 
front of its fading glory sat an 
officer behind an old desk, his 
sword laid across it still in its 
scabbard, scribbling away with a 
quill pen at a piece of paper. 

The pilgrim looked around as 
they waited for the captain to 
complete his writing chore, and 
he noticed for the first time that 
the ball of witch fire had follow- 
ed them into the building. It 
perched on a railing not far from 
the captain’s desk, and the cap- 
tain noticed it as soon as he 
looked up. 

He would rather not Have no- 
ticed it, the pilgrim thought. He

would ratlier Save stared over- 
bearingly at tfie prisoner, but he 
saw the witch fire first and said, 
“Get that out of here!” 

“How would I do that, cap- 
tain?” the sergeant asked. 

The captain was thin and red- 
haired and choleric. “Then get 
yourself out of here!” 

“This pilgrim is pretty good 
with a quarterstaff,” the ser- 
geant said. “Beat up a mercen- 
ary pretty good with it.” 

“Well, he doesn’t have a quar- 
ter staff now, does he?” the cap- 
tain asked. 

“What I meant, captain, was 
he might be good with other 
things, his fists, maybe.” 

“I can take care of anything 
He lias in the way of exotic skills,” 
the captain said. “Get out.” 

A s soon as the sergeant Had de- 
parted, the captain said, 
“The quality of non-commission- 
ed officers you get these days is 
appalling. You’ll have to pay a 
fine for brawling in the streets, 
you know. That will be two gold 
pieces.” 

“Which you will pocket,” the 
pilgrim said. “Forget all that, 
captain. I’m on a special mission 
for the Emperor.” 

“And who might you be,” the 
captain drawled, “to be doing a 
special mission for the Emperor?” 
“My name is Leonard Kelley.” 
“Head of the Emperor’s secret 
WITCH HUNT 



police,” the captain completed 
for him. “And what is the nature 
of your mission, pilgrim?” 
“That’s my business, and the 
Emperor Bartlett’s.” 

“I supose you Have identifi- 
cation.” 

“Of course. In my belt.” He 
fumbled beneath his clothing for 
the belt, undid the buttons on it, 
and drew out nothing. He fum- 
bled around in the empty pocket, 
thinking that he had not looked 
into it for several months, re- 
membering the morning he found 
the belt beside his blanket. “I’ve 
lost it. Someone’s stolen it.” 
“You’ve lost it,” the captain 
said, resignation in his voice. 
“Pay the two gold pieces.’” 

“I can give you corrobrative 
information about the court — ” 
‘“I’ve never been to court, pil- 
grim. It would be amusing to see 
you trying to impress me, but I 
don’t have the time. Pay the two 
gold pieces.” 

“Why would I try to make you 
believe a lie that could so easily 
be disproved?” 

“People tell me tfie damnedest 
things, pilgrim. I’ve given up try- 
ing to guess why they do it. Pay 
the two gold pieces.” 

“Pilgrims Have no money.” 

“I was afraid so. Why does that 
absurd sergeant keep bringing 
you beggars in here? Sergeant!” 
The sergeant trotted into the 
room.

“Give this pretentious pilgrim 
a caning — five should be enough 
— no, make it ten. And then throw 
Him out.” 

TC'or a moment the pilgrim 
tliougKt of making a fight 
of it, but Ke tliougKt again and 
decided against it. He shrugged 
his shoulders and went with tKe 
sergeant to a dingy cellar. It 
once Had been something more 
than a cellar. It had had carved 
wood panels on the walls, but 
most of the panels Had been 
wrenched away. Now there were 
cuffs fastened to the wall. 

Two of the soldiers slipped his 
hands into the cuffs and fastened 
them. The sergeant removed his 
robe and tore his shirt down his 
back. He stepped back and chose 
a sturdy cane from: a basket of 
them. He made it whistle through 
the air in preparation. Then, 
counting aloud in a voice like a 
grunt, He began to apply the cane 
to the pilgrim’s back. Against his 
will, the pilgrim grunted, too, as 
the cane landed; then He moaned 
and before the tenth was applied 
Ke howled a little. 

The soldiers released Him from 
the cuffs and the sergeant Handed 
Him His robe. Gingerly the pilgrim 
adjusted it over His bleeding 
shoulders and stepped out into 
the street. 

“Remember,” the sergeant said. 
“No brawling.” 

46 



TKe pilgrim thought he would 
remember. 

The streets were dark. Guriev? 
had rung while he had been in 
the captain’s office, and the streets 
were deserted as well. The pilgrinj 
shivered, and the involuntary 
movement made His back Hurt 
anew. He Had to get away quick- 
ly, Ke knew, but which way and 
where? 

“Pilgrim,” someone said. “Kel- 
ley!” 

The pilgrim started and turn- 
ed His whole body to face a par- 
ticularly impenetrable area of 
darkness. 

“It’s me, Susannah.” The girl 
came out of the darkness into 
the patch of light cast from the 
window above, wHere a candle 
flickered and the captain, no 
doubt, was working on His inter- 
minable reports which one day, 
he Hoped, would get him to court 

“You did take the identifica- 
tion,” the pilgrim said. 

“Yes, and then I had no way 
to get it back without telling 
you, and I didn’t want to do that. 
Anyway, I thought a captain in 
the Emperor’s secret police ought 
to have a taste of the Emperor’s 
justice.” 

TKe pilgrim eased His shoulders 
into a more comfortable position. 
“I Have,” He said ruefully. 

S usannah made a crooning sound 
and moved forward. 



GALAXY 



“Never mind. We’ve no time. In 
about fifteen minutes tKe cap- 
tain is going to send fils troops 
after me.” 

“But you’ve already been pun- 
isfied.” 

“He is going to reflect that I 
may be Captain Leonard Kelley 
after all. And fie is going to con- 
sider that I will remember him 
when I get back to those wfio 
know me. And fie will suspect 
that I will see fie is taken care of 
in the nicest possible way. Rattier 
than take that chance, fie would 
rather kill me now.” 

“Follow me,” Susannafi said, 
and she led him tfirougfi the dark 
streets, between ruins, and up the 
beginning slope of a hill. 

In the distance, as they climb- 
ed, were the sounds of a horse 
stomping and a cart rattling as 
it moved forward and back and 
a distant voice shouting impre- 
cations. “He was not a very 
bright officer,” the pilgrim said. 
“It was more like twenty-five 
minutes.” 

“There’s a little village on the 
other side of this hill,” Susannah 
said. 

“That’s the first place the sol- 
diers would look for us.” 

“Of course. But right up on 
top of this hill, where according 
to legend there once was a uni- 
versity which was burned at the 
start of Lowbrow Rebellion, is 
the villa of a witch-doctor.” 

WITCH HUNT 



“And you think He will take 
us in?” 

“Why not?” 

“The captain of Emperor Bart- 
lett’s secret police?” 

“A pilgrim. We all Have pasts.” 

“Not like mine. I’ve even burn- 
ed witches.” 

“The witch-doctors always 
have known who you are and 
what you want, right from the 
first moment you started study- 
ing with the witch-doctor near 
Denver.” 

“And what did I want?” 

“To find out as much as pos- 
sible about the witcfi-doctors so 
the Emperor could use their pow- 
ers to enlarge his empire. 

The pilgrim made a sound of 
dismay and humor. 

“True?” Susannah asked Sim 
candidly. 

“True enough,” he admitted re- 
luctantly. 

“And now?” 

“I don’t know,” He said. "I’ve 
seen many ways of life, and there 
is much to be said for eaeS of 
them. 

“Anyway,” Susannah said, “we 
are not going to the villa. He’s, 
gone.” 

“Where then?” 

“To the chapel.” 

“Why?” 

“Why else? To pray.” And 
without further conversation she 
led the pilgrim up the hill t® his, 
salvation.

Hplie villa was identical with' all 
-*■ the otliers, low, sprawling, 
ligHted, potent. Behind it was tlie 
domed chapel, standing like a 
silo in the night. 

Susannah led him to it, for tlie 
pilgrim Had a strange reluctance 
to enter the building. She urged 
liim through the doorway. There 
was nothing new about it. Both 
of them Had entered similar chap- 
els in other places at other times 
separately. Susannah pressed a 
button that closed the door be- 
hind them. 

“Well, tliey can’t get at us; 
tliat’s for sure,” the pilgrim said. 
“But we can’t get out either, and 
they’re likely to post a guard out 
there until we get hungry enough 
to come out.” 

“I think the truth is here, some- 
where, if we can only discover it,” 
Susannah said. 

Slie motioned him up a ladder 
to the meditation room. They 
sat in the two padded chairs and 
meditated. 

“A pilgrim is a witch-doctor’s 
way of making another witch- 
doctor,” the pilgrim muttered. 
“What did you say?” 

The pilgrim repeated it. “Just 
something I thought of.” 

“Wh’at else did you think of?” 
“Why are witch-doctors?” 
“Yes,” Susannah said. “Go on.” 
“What do they do besides serve 
48 



others? Because th'ey must do 
something. They do something 
human. Right?” 

“Or witcH-doctorisli.” 

“Tliat’s the same thing, a kind 
of special humanness. And where 
do they do it? Everywhere that 
we have seen them they live 
alone. Perhaps somewhere else on 
this world they are all witch-doc- 
tors together, and they do some- 
thing.” 

“Something wonderful.” 

“Or something terrible.” 
“Never.” 

“If we have seen all there is. 
to see — there may be stranger 
ways of living, but we must 
think that what we have seen 
on our travels represents what is 
typical — then tlie witch-doctors 
must do what they do somewliere 
not on this world.” 

“Yes,” Susannah said. 

“Yes,” the pilgrim said. 

“We have found the truth.” 
“We have found the truth.” 
“Tliey say,” Susannah said, 
“that wlien a pilgrim has found 
the truth he should press the but- 
ton in the meditation room of a 
chapel, and if he has truly found 
it he will ascend to heaven. And 
if lie has not found it he will die.” 
“Tliat is what they say.” 

“Shall I press it?” 

“Press it!” 

S usannah pressed the button in; 
front of her. As she did so, a 

GALAXY 



jolt rocked' them back in their 
chairs. Metal straps closed around 
their arms and legs and waists 
and pulled them tightly into the 
chairs. 

But they were pulled tighter 
still by some other force. It tug- 
ged at all the parts of their body, 
their cheeks, eyeballs, face, arms, 
legs, inner organs . And it tug- 
ged and tugged for an eternity. 
Suddenly eternity was over, and 
they floated in their straps, sick- 
eningly free of pressures but op- 
pressed by a new sensation. 

Then the force tugged them 
back once more into the cushion- 
ed chairs for another eternity and 
released them once more and 
they floated again and they vom- 
ited. The vomit floated in glob- 
ules in the air about them. 

“Congratulations,” said a voice 
without a body, a voice which! 
sounded a little like the voice of 
their witch-doctor, whoever he 
might be, and a little like the 
voice of God. “You have found 
the truth, or by accident you have 
placed yourself in great jeopardy. 
The next few minutes and hours 
will determine whether you will 
find what you have been seeking 
or you will be dead.” 

The metal cuffs released' them 
from their seats, and they, too, 
floated in the air. It was a bit 
like the gymnastic exercises he 
had performed in the witch-doc- 
tor’s school. 

WITCH HUNT 



“You now are in orbit around 
the earth, which means you are 
out in space where there is no 
air, nothing to breathe, no food, 
to eat, and either no heat or too 
much heat, and you will freeze car 
bum. 

“In the lockers around this 
room, which now are open, is 
equipment which you must use if 
you are to survive. If you have 
an unconquerable fear of ma- 
chines or an unreasonable preju- 
dice against them, you are doom- 
ed. Your life depends upon the 
proper use of these machines. You 
also must depend upon what my 
voice tells you, for you have only 
two other referrents for this kind 
of environment: your schooling 
and your native and conditioned 
adaptability.” 

Susannah and the pilgrim were 
becoming a little better accustom- 
ed to the novel sensation of free 
fall. The globs of rejected food 
and fluids, however, were a nui- 
sance as they brushed into them 
and the globs spread over their 
bodies. Susannah found an open 
container and lid in one of the 
lockers and chased the larger 
globs around the room until she 
had most of them captured. She 
discovered that if she kept the 
container in forward motion the 
contents would remain at the bot- 
tom,, but if she forgot they would 
float out again. The pilgrim 
found a cloth and swatted at the 

m 



remainder until the air was rea- 
sonably clear. TKe container and 
clotfi were pushed into a recepta- 
cle marked wastes. 

When they finisSed they learn- 
ed tKat they could maneuver rea- 
sonably well in this new environ- 
ment. 

1\/T eanwliile tHe voice continued 
d-VX w itH its instructions and 
admonitions. “Your capsule — 
tliis machine for traveling in 
space which encloses you — is 
approaching a space station, a 
village for living in space, where 
there is no air, no food, and too 
much or too little Heat. You must 
not only survive the environment 
in this capsule, which will get 
deadlier, you must find a way to 
survive a passage through the 
Hostile environment outside and 
make your way, with some novel 
method of travel, to the space 
station. 

“And once you have accom- 
plished this, your ordeal, your 
final examination, will be over. 

“Everything you need is around 
you. Think, adapt, use. Remem- 
ber that nothing is intrinsically 
evil or intrinsically good. Every- 
thing depends upon How it is 
used.” 

The pilgrim looked at Susan- 
nah; she was looking at him. 
They both looked around the 
room at the many lockers yet un- 
opened whicli might hold the key 
50 



to their survival. The pilgrim 
felt a flare of rebellion at the 
unfairness of this test, thrust up- 
on them so unexpectedly, upon 
which depended their continued 
existence. 

THey were not yet ready 
for this alien experience. And then 
he thought — and his resentment 
began to fade — how could they 
be ready for something as alien 
as this if they had not been born 
into it? 

“You may be feeling that you 
have gambled your lives without 
foreknowledge of the game, that 
Had you known the stakes you 
would not Have played. But this 
is true of all men. No one ever 
knows the stakes except that at 
the end, however long delayed, 
tliere will be death. 

“Our goal is to breed a new 
man who can adapt to the ma- 
chine and the environment of 
machine-aided civilization. Some 
we can breed Here in space, where 
man and child must learn ,to de- 
pend utterly on the machine to 
sustain life, for one mistake usu- 
ally is fatal. Thus the natural law 
assumes new vitality: the sur- 
vival of the fittest. 

“Many others we recruit from 
earth, where the store of genetic 
material — of that which makes 
men and women have children 
like themselves — is still far 
greater then we can muster and 
still of infinite potential.”

new meaning. 

“Here is food,” SusannaH said. 
“A kind of paste th'at you squirt 
into your mouth like this. And a 
kind of fluid that you suck 
through a tube. At least we won’t 
Starve, not immediately.” 

“And Here are a couple of fun- 
ny suits,” the pilgrim said. 

“They look like they’re made 
of silver.” 

“But they’re flexible, except for 
the joints and a crazy kind of hel- 
met.” 

Susannah came over to look at 
them. “If there’s no air outside, 
[then we couldn’t breathe. We 
would die if we didn’t take air 
with us. Maybe this is meant to 
hold the air around us.” 

“.That’s it,” the pilgrim said. 
“And maybe these tubes are 
meant to contain extra air so that 
you can take more air than what 
the suit would contain. Look! 
There’s a place in the back where 
something like this can be at- 
tached.” He fiddled with the 
closed tube and a gush of cold 
air came out. He sniffed. “Smells 
all right, but cold.” 

“I think we ought to put them 
on right now,” said SusannaH.

whole was incapable of living 
with machines; and with science 
Because it took from them the 
power of decision over tfieir own- 
lives and deaths. Tfiey rebelled. 
Most of them died, unable to 
survive without the abundance 
created by the machine. Some, 
who had proved their ability to 
adapt to new conditions, went 
into space. They wanted to sur- 
vive, of course, But also they 
wanted man to survive and his 
pursuit of knowledge to survive. 
Tfiey wanted Him to learn more 
about himself, about Bis past, 
about his future, about Bis place 
in the universe. 

“And he is doing this — man, 
not superman. The traits were al- 
ways there, the potential for cre- 
ativity and adaptability and ad- 
venturousness, just as there was 
in man the content of the villager, 
the hunger of the Emperor, the 
lust of tfie mercenary, the greed 
of the shopkeeper, the inquisitive- 
ness of the Neo-Scientist, the sim- 
plicity of the Luddite. 

“Out of this mix of traits we 
select intelligence and adapt- 
ability and benevolence by mak- 
ing them a matter of survival.” 

npiie pilgrim was Helping Susan* 
nafi into her silver suit. Get- 
ting into them would Have been 
difficult enough under normal 
conditions, but in weightlessness 

51 



it was practically impossible. 

“How do we survive?” the voice 
continued. “How do we get the 
wealth to mount our expeditions 
to the planets of this system? 
How do we maintain our villas on 
earth? It comes down to energy, 
which is a kind of wealth; in- 
deed in the end it is the only real 
kind of wealth. And in space, en- 
ergy is free. There is too much 
of it, so much that it will kill 
you if you don’t respect it. And 
we are, as well, the sole users of 
atomic power, the surprising en- 
ergy of the very small. For ma- 
terials, we mine the moon and 
the inhospitable areas of earth 
and its seas. We are rich. 

“But wealth, like anything else, 
is neither good nor evil. It must 
be used properly. On earth we 
use it to help, freely, without in- 
terfering in men’s free choices. In 
space we use it to move onward 
and outward, as man must do to 
be man, respecting all life and 
particularly respecting all pos- 
sible thinking life, although' other 
than man we have found none 
yet. That is what we live by.” 

By now Susannah 1 was into her 
suit, and the pilgrim fastened a 
tube of air onto her back, turned 
the valve, and hoped it would 
work. Then he helped her put on 
the helmet and fastened it. She 
motioned frantically at his suit 
and then at him. He floated and 
inserted his legs into the suit.

“Within a few minutes deceler- 
ation — slowing down — - and 
minor course adjustments will be- 
gin,” the voice said, “and you 
must be back in your chairs of 
you will be rattled around in this 
capsule like dice in a box. You 
might be injured. If you have 
made good use of your time, you 
will be in the space suits by now. 
If you are not, there is no time to 
start and complete the job. 

“Five minutes after decelera- 
tion, the capsule door will open 
and the air in the capsule will 
rush out. If you are not properly 
protected, you will die within 
a minute or so. If you are pro- 
tected, you will see outside the 
port the space station known as 
Truth. If you make it to that 
station and into it, you will he 
one of us.” 

fT'h’e pilgrim Had struggled Sis 
* suit closed and was trying to 
work the helmet into position 
with his clumsy, gloved hands 
while Susannah fastened the tube 
to his back. 

“Take your places in the 
chairs,” said the voice. "Now! 
And good luck to you.” 

They moved quickly to the 
chair. Once settled into the 
chairs by pulling themselves 
down by the arms, they found 
their arms and legs again encir- 
cled. Almost as soon as that hap- 
pened, they were tugged deep into 

GALAJff 



tKe cushions again and then tug- 
ged from one side to another. Af- 
ter a moment the shifting weights 
[vanished, and they were free. 

Susannah sprang back to his 
helmet, checking the catches to 
isee if all were closed, finding one 
open and closing it; and, not un- 
like monkeys searching each oth- 
er’s fur for salt, he did the same 
for her. 

In the midst of their inspec- 
tions, a gust spun them around. 
(The air leaving, the pilgrim 
thought. He caught Susannah 
and braced himself against one 
of the seats until the gusts subsid- 
ed. 

“Are you all right?” he asked. 

Inside her helmet her - eyes 
were looking at him. He saw her 
lips move. 

“I can’t hear you,” he said. 

She shook her head. He shrug- 
ged. 

He motioned her toward the 
door and then halted beside a 
locker they Had not yet opened. 
He opened it. Inside was a rope 
and a pair of small hand ma- 
chines. He did not know what 
they were for, but he grabbed 
them and then preceded Susan- 
nah down the ladder. 

At the outer door he looked out 
the opening from which the door 
was completely gone — and saw 
the stars. For a moment his senses 
rebelled, and he felt that he might 
be sick again. But he recalled his 
WITCH HUNT 



schooling about tlie stars and 
took a deep breath and forced 
himself to stare back at the star- 
ing stars, set in the blackest night, 
where a man might fall for ever 
and never, without end, into in- 
finity and beyond. And He turn- 
ed to Susannah, who was staring 
past his shoulder, and fastened 
the rope around both of them 
with clumsy gloves, and tried to 
tie a square knot that he Hoped 
would hold. 

He gave Her one of the hand 
machines. When she looked at 
him questioningly he looked 
blank. Then he eased himself out 
of the doorway. He floated free, 
and then Susannah, too, was free, 
and they floated above the cap- 
sule and they saw the earth above 
them. 

Tt liung there in the black sky, 
huge, with misty mountains 
and shrouded blue seas and 
brown and green patches of earth, 
all muted into pastels by a veil 
of air. And suddenly the earth 
flipped over and was beneath 
them. TKe pilgrim gasped and 
tried to claw for support, and 
there was none. He forced him- 
self to look away. 

He saw the sun, clear and burn- 
ing, as Ke Had never seen it be- 
fore, and Ke looked away quickly 
lest He go blind. 

He saw the space station, a 
large wheel turning in tire black 

53 



sky, surrounded by metal bub- 
bles that floated freely around it. 
So close and yet so Hopelessly far 
away. 

Susanna!! Ead been inspecting 
tEe machine the pilgrim had given 
her. She closed her gloved hand 
on it, and it hissed. It emitted a 
white exhaust. Alarmed, she re- 
leased her grasp on it, and it 
shot away before she could grab 
it again. It receded quickly and 
soon was lost in the distance. 

Susannah tapped the pilgrim’s 
helmet and pointed at the ma- 
chine in his hand and at the one 
that had disappeared toward the 
overhanging-undergirding earth, 
pointed at the direction it had 
been pointed and then indicated 
that the pilgrim should point his 
machine in a direction opposite 
the space station and squeeze its 
handle. 

The pilgrim Ead seen and un- 
derstood. Lessons He had learned 
about physics and chemistry and 
astronomy were coming back to 
him in a flood. There was some- 
thing about an action and an 
equal and opposite reaction. 

He pointed the machine and 
squeezed and released. He look- 
ed over his shoulder. The space- 
suited figures accelerated toward 
the station. 

But they missed the station by 
fifty feet. Quickly the pilgrim 
turned and fired in the opposite 
direction, but the maneuver took 
54 



time and some of the precious 
contents of the hand machine to 
stop their progress and then re- 
verse it. But the space station 
stopped receding and began to 
come back toward them again. 

At that point the little machine 
gave its last little puff. The pil- 
grim drew back his arm to throw 
it away and changed his mind. 
He checked their progress and 
direction and then, as he saw they 
might miss again, he carefully 
threw the machine in a direction 
calculated to send them closer. 

As the space station grew clos- 
er, the pilgrim fumbled with the 
rope that bound him to Susannah. 
He loosened the knot and forced 
one end of the rope into Susan- 
nah’s hand and held the other 
firmly in his. He placed his foot 
against Susannah’s side and spun 
her away from him in the direc- 
tion of the space station. 

As they approached the station, 
they would have passed through 
the gap between the rim of the 
wheel and the hub, but the rope 
held between them caught the 
spoke and spun them around the 
spoke until they clanged against 
it and hung on grimly. 

T here were handholds on the 
spoke. After the pilgrim had 
regained his breath and his nerve, 
he began pulling himself with 
painful care toward the hub, 
holding the end of the rope in 

GALAXY 



one Hand so that SusannaH would 
not slip away; It seemed to Him 
tfiat they crawled forever before 
tfiey reacHed the Hub. 

Tfie pilgrim searcHed for an 
entrance. He found a crack. He 
traced it. Beside tHe crack was a 
Handle. He pulled it. THe door 
swung open. Working carefully 
so tfiat they did not lose tHeir 
grasp on tlie Hub at any time, tHe 
pilgrim and SusannaH made tHeir 
way tHrougfi tHe door and into a 
small, tubular room. Opposite tlie 
door they Had entered was anoth- 
er door and another Handle. THe 
pilgrim pulled it. THe door be- 
hind them closed. A ligKt above 
them and one below them came 
on. 

Tfie pilgrim felt 9s if He were 
a puddle of boneless flesh witfiin 
his suit. Through SusannaH’s hel- 
met he could see that she, too, 
was breathing deeply. 

After a minute or two the door 
in front of them swung back. 
Gloved men moved surely to help 
them through the doorway. They 



seemed fike ordinary men in cov- 
eralls. Well, the pilgrim thought, 
perhaps not quite like ordinary 
men. 

There was a certain calm 
sureness about them, in tfie way 
they moved in this weightless 
condition, a serenity of features, 
an air of infinite capacity. Tfiey 
moved quickly to take tfie Hel- 
mets from tHe pilgrim’s Head and 
then Susannah’s. They began 
stripping away tlie silver suit. 

As the last part of their suits 
was removed, an older man came 
forward. He floated through tfie 
air as if it were tfie most natural 
metfiod of locomotion imaginable. 
He field out His Hands to both of 
them. 

“Welcome!” he said in a tone 
that made them sure they were 
indeed welcome, that He was glad 
they Had made it. “My name is 
John Wilson. That won’t mean 
anything to you. But welcome. 
Welcome to tHe company of 
witches.”

WITCH HUNT 



55 



Beam Us Home 

by JAMES TIPTREE, JR. 

Hobie always knew they'd come 
for him. But it took so long I 



TT obie’s parents migKt Have 
seen the first signs if they 
had been watching around 8:30 
on Friday nights. But Hobie was 
the youngest of five active bright- 
normal kids. Who was to notice 
one more uproar around the TV? 

A couple of years later Hobie’s 
Friday night battles shifted to 
10 PM, and then his sisters got 
their own set. Hobie was growing 
fast then. In public He featured 
chiefly as a tanned streak on the 
tennis courts and a 99th percen- 
tile series of math grades. To his 
parents, Hobie featured as the 
one without problems. This was 
hard to avoid in a family that 
included a diabetic, a girl with an 
IQ of 185 and another with con- 
trollable petit mal, and a would- 
be ski star who spent most of 
his time in a cast. Hobie’s own 
IQ was in the fortunate one-for- 



ties, the range where you’re Su- 
perior enough to lead, but not 
too superior to be followed. He 
seemed perfectly satisfied with 
his communications with his par- 
ents, but he didn’t use them; 
much 

Not that he was in any way 
neglected when the need arose. 
The time he got staph in a cor- 
neal scratch, for instance, his 
parents did a great job of sup- 
porting him through the pain bit 
and the hospital bit and so on. 
But they couldn’t know all the 
little incidents. Like the night 
that Hobie called so fiercely for 
Dr. McCoy that a young interfl 
named McCoy went in and joked 
for half an hour with the feverish 
boy in his dark room. 

To the end, His parents prob- 
ably never understood that there 
was anything to understand 
56 



about Hobie. And wfiat was to 
see? His tennis and His model 
rocket collection made Him look 
almost too normal for tfie small 
Honors scfiool fie went to first. 
Then His family moved to 
an executive bedroom suburb 
wfiere tfie scfiool system Had 
a bigger budget than Mona- 
co and a soccer team load- 
ed with National Merit Science 
finalists. Here Hobie blended 
right in with 1 the scenery. One 
more healtfiy, friendly, polite kid 
with brigfit gray eyes under a 
blond bowl-cut and very fast witfi 
any sort of ball game. 

The brightest eyes around Him 
were reading The Double Helix 
to find out How to make it in re- 
searcH, or studying the Wall Street 
Journal. If Hobie stood out at 
all, it was only that He didn’t 
seem to be worried about making 
it in research or any other way, 
particularly. But that fitted in, 
too. Those days, a lot of boys 
were standing around looking as 
if they couldn’t believe what went 
on, as if they were waiting for — 
who knows? — a better world, 
their glands, something. Hobie’s 
faintly aghast expression was not 
unique. Events like the installa- 
tion of an armed patrol around 
the school enclave were bound to 
have a disturbing effect on the 
more sensitive kids. People got 
the idea that Hobie was sensitive 
in some indefinite way. His usu- 

BEAM US HOME 



al manner was open but quiet, 
tolerant of a put-on that didn’t 
end. 

TTis advisor did fret over His 
failure to settle on a major 
field of interest in time for the 
oncoming threat of the college 
rat-race. First His math interest 
seemed to cop out after the spe- 
cial calculus course, although He 
never blew an exam. Tfien fie 
switched to the pre-college an- 
thropology panel the scfiool was 
trying. Here fie made good grades 
and acted very motivated, until 
the semester when the visiting re- 
search team began pounding on 
sampling techniques and statisti- 
cal significance. Hobie Had no 
trouble with’ things like CKi 
square, of course. But after mak- 
ing his A in the final, He gave 
them his sweet, unbelieving smile 
and faded. His advisor found Him 
spending a lot of Hours polishing 
a six-incH telescope lens in the 
school shop. 

So Hobie was tagged as some 
kind of an under-acKiever, but 
nobody knows wfiat kind, be- 
cause of those grades;. And some- 
thing about that smile bothered 
them; it seemed to stop sound. 

Tfie girls liked Kim, tfiougfi, 
and fie went through the usual 
pfiases rather fast. Tfiere was the 
week fie and various birds went 
to thirty-five drive-in movies. 
And the two months fie went 

57 



around Humming Mrs. Robbinson 
in a meaningful way. And tKe 
warm, comfortable summer wfien 
lie and His tfien girl and two otH- 
er couples went up to Stratford, 
Ontario with sleeping bags to 
see tKe Czech multimedia tiling. 

Girls regarded Him as ‘differ- 
ent,’ altliougfi lie never knew 
why. “You look at me like it’s al- 
ways goodbye,” one of tKem told 
Him. In fact lie did treat girls 
witH an odd detached gentleness, 
as tfiougK he knew a secret that 
might make them all disappear. 
Some of them Hung around be- 
cause of his quick brown Hands, 
or his really 'great looks, some 
because they hoped to share the 
secret. In this they were disap- 
pointed. Hobie talked, and He lis- 
tened carefully, but it never was 
mutual talk-talk-talk of total ca- 
tharsis that most couples went 
through. But How could Hobie 
know that? 

Like most of his peer group, 
Hobie stayed away from acid and 
agreed that pot was preferable to 
getting juiced. His friends never 
urged Him too hard, though, af- 
ter the beach party where he 
spooked everybody by talking 
excitedly lor hours to people who 
weren’t there. They decided he 
might have a yulnerable ego- 
structure. 

The high-school’s official .view 
was that Hobie had no real prob- 
lems. In this they were supported 
58 



by a test battery profile that 
could have qualified him as the 
ideal normal, control. Certainly 
there was nothing to get hold of 
in His routine interviews with the 
HigK-scKool psychologist. 

H obie came in after lunch, a 
time when Dr. Morehouse 
knew He was not at Hi’s most in- 
tuitive. They went through the 
usual openers, Hobie sitting easi- 
ly, patient and interested, with a 
faint air of listening to some 
sound back of the acoustical ceil- 
ing tiles. 

“I see a lot of young people 
who are having their trouble dis- 
covering who they really are. 
Searching for their own identi- 
ties,” Morehouse offered. He was 
idly tracing up a stack of typ- 
ing headed Sex differences in the 
adolescent identity crisis. 

“Do you?” Hobie asked polite- 
ly- 

Morehouse frowned at Himself 
and belched disarmingly. 

“Sometimes I wonder who I 
am,” He granted. 

“Do you?” inquired Hobie. 
“Don’t you?” 

“No,” said Hobie. 

Morehouse reached for the hos- 
tility that should have been there, 
found it wasn’t. Not passive ag- 
gression. ,Wfiat? His intuition 
awoke briefly. He looked into 
Hohie’s light Hazel eyes and sud- 
denly found himself slipping to- 

GALAXY 



ward some very large uninhabited 
dimension. A real pubescent pre* 
schiz? He wondered Hopefully. 
No, again, He decided, and found 
Himself thinking, wEat if a person 
is sure of His identity but it isn’t 
Eis identity? He often wondered 
tEat; perEaps it could be worked 
up into a creative insigHt. 

“Maybe it’s tfie other way 
around,” Hobie was saying before 
the pause grew awkward. 

“How do you mean?” 

“Well, maybe you’re all won- 
dering who you are,” Hobie’s lips 
quirked; it was clear he was just 
making conversation. 

“I asked for that,” Morehouse 
smiled. They chatted about sib- 
ling rivalry and psychological 
statistics and wound up in plenty 
of time for Morehouse’s next boy, 
wEo turned out to be a satisfying 
HigH Anx. Morehouse forgot 
about the empty place he Had slid 
into. He often did that, too. 

Tt was a girl who got part of it 
-*• out of Hobie, at three in the 
morning. “Dog,” she was called 
then, although her name was 
Jane. A tender, bouncy little bird 
who cocked Her head to listen up 
at Him in a way Hobie liked. Dog 
would listen with the same soft 
intensity to the supermarket 
clerk and the pediatrician later 
on, but neither of them knew that. 

They Had been talking about 
the state of the world, which was 
BEAM US HOME 



then quite prosperous and peace- 
ful. That is to say, about seventy 
million people were starving to 
death in Asia, a number of West- 
Hem tyrannies were maintaining 
themselves on police terror tac- 
tics, four or five borders were 
being fought over. Hobie’s fami- 
ly’s maid Had just been cut up 
by the suburban peacekeeping 
squad, and the school Bad added 
a charged wire and two dogs to 
its patrol. But none of the big 
nations were waving fissionables, 
and the U.S.-Soviet entente was 
a twenty-year reality. 

Dog was Holding Hobie’s head' 
over the side of her car, because 
He Had been the one who found 
the maid crawling on Her Hand- 
bones among the azaleas. 

“If you feel like that, wEy 
don’t you do something?” Dog 
asked him between spasms. “Do 
you want some Slurp? It’s all 
we’ve got.” 

“Do what?” Hobie quavered. 

“Politics?” guessed Dog. She re- 
ally didn’t know. THe Protest 
Decade was long over, along with 
Brotherhood. There was a school 
legend about a senior who had 
come back from Chicago with a 
collar-bone busted by Daley’s 
Squad. Some time after that the 
kids Had discovered that flowers 
weren’t really very powerful, and 
that CP agitators Had their own 
bag. Why go on the street when 
you could really do more in one 

59 



of tfie good jobs available In- 
side? So Dog could offer only 
a vague image of Hobie running 
for something, a sincere face on 

TV. 

“You could join the Young 
Statesmen.” 

“Not to interfere,” gasped Ho- 
bie. He wiped his mouth. Then 
fie pulled himself together and 
tried some of the Slurp. In tKe 
dashlight his seventeen-year-old 
sideburns struck Dog as tremen- 
dously mature and beautiful. 

“Oh, it’s not so bad,” said Ho- 
bie. “I mean, it’s not unusually 
bad. It’s just a stage. This world 
is just going through a primi- 
tive stage. There’s a lot of stages. 
It takes a long time. Tfiey’re just 
very very backward, that’s all.” 

“They,” said Dog, listening to 
every word. 

“I mean,” lie said. 

“You’re alienated,” slie told 
fiim. “Rinse your mouth! out with 
that. You don’t relate to people.” 

C(T think you’re people,” fie 

-*• said, rinsing. He’d heard this 
before. “I relate to you,” fie 
said. He leaned out to spit. Then 
fie twisted his head to look up at 
the sky and stayed that way 
awhile, like an animal’s fiead 
sticking out of a crate. Dog could 
feel him trembling the car. 

“Are you going to barf again?” 
she asked. 

“No,” he reassured fier. But 



then suddenly he did, roaringly. 
She clutcfied at his shoulders 
while he heaved. After awfiile fie 
sagged down, his fiead lolling 
limply out on one arm. 

“It’s sucfi a mess,” sfie Heard 
him whispering. “It’s sucfi a rot- 
ten miserable mess mess mess 
MESS MESS — ” 

He was pounding his Band on 
the car side. 

“I’ll hose it,” said Dog, but 
then she saw he didn’t mean the 
car. 

“Why does it have to go on and 
on?” he croaked. “Why don’t 
they just stop it? I can’t bear it 
much longer, please, please, I 
can’t — ” 

Dog was scared now. 

“Honey, it’s not that bad, Ho- 
bie honey, it’s not that bad,” 
she told fiim, patting at him 
pressing fier soft front against his 
back. 

Suddenly fie came back into 
the car on top of her, spent. 

“It’s unbearable,” he muttered. 

“What’s unbearable?” sfie 
snapped, mad at him for scaring 
her. “What’s unbearable for you 
and not for me? I mean, I know 
it’s a mess, but why is it so bad 
for you? I have to live here too.” 

“It’s your world,” he told fier 
absently, lost in some private 
desolation. 

Dog yawned. 

“I better drive you home now,” 
she said.

He Had nothing more to say 
and sat quietly. When Dog 
glanced at His profile sHe decided 
He looked calm. Almost stupid, 
in fact his mouth hung open a 
little. SHe didn’t recognize the 
expression, because she had never 
seen people looking out of cattle 
cars. 

Hobie’s class graduated that 
June. His grades were well up, 
and everybody understood that 
He was acting a little unrelated 
because of the traumatic business 
with the maid. He got a lot of 
sympathy. 

I t was after the graduation ex- 
ercises that Hobie surprised 
his parents for the first and last 
time. They Had been congratu- 
lating themselves on Having steer- 
ed their fifth offspring safely 
through the college crisis and in- 
to a high-status Eastern. Hobie 
announced that he had applied 
for the United States Air Force 
Academy. 

This was a bomb, because Ho- 
bie Had never shown the slightest 
interest in things military. In 
fact, just the opposite. Hobie’s 
parents took it for granted that 
the educated classes viewed the 
military witH tolerant distaste. 
Why did their son want this? Was 
it another of His unstable motiva- 
tional orientations? But Hobie 
persisted. He didn’t have any rea- 
sons, but He Had thought care- 
BEAM US HOME 



fully and felt that this was fen 
him. Finally they recalled tfiat 
early model rocket collection; 
maybe this was something deep. 
His father decided he was serious, 
and began sorting out the gen- 
erals his research firm did busi- 
ness with. In September Ho- 
bie disappeared into Colorado 
Springs. He reappeared for 
Christmas in the form of an ex- 
otically hairless, erect and polite 
stranger in uniform. 

During the next four years Ho- 
bie the person became effectively 
invisible behind a growing pile 
of excellent evaluation reports. 
There seemed to be no doubt 
that he was working very hard, 
and his motivation gave no sign 
of flagging. Like everybody, he 
bitched about many of the Acad- 
emy’s little ways, and told some 
funny stories. But he never seem- 
ed discouraged. When he elected 
to spend his summers in special 
aviation skills training, his par- 
ents realized that Hobie had 
found himself. 

No one was surprised when in 
his senior year he told them He 
had applied for and been accept- 
ed into the new astronaut train- 
ing program. The U.S. space 
program was just then starting up 
again after the revulsion caused 
by the wreck of the first manned 
satellite lab ten years before. 

“I bet that’s what he had in 
mind all along,” Hobie’s father 

61 



cHuckled. “He didn’t want to say 
so Before fie made it.” Tfiey were 
all relieved. A son in tfie Space 
Program was a lot easier to live 
witfi, status-wise. 

Wfien she Heard tfie news, Dog, 
wfio was now married and called 
fierself Jane, sent Him a card 
witfi a picture of tfie Man in tfie 
Moon. Anotfier girl, more perci- 
pient, sent Kim a card sfiowing 
some stars. 

But Hobie never made it to tfie 
Space Program. 

Tt was tKe summer wfien several 
not-very-serious events Hap- 
pened all together. Tfie BrltisR 
devalued tfieir wobbly pound 
again, just when it was found tfiat 
far too many dollars were going 
out of tfie States. East and West 
Germany moved a step closer to 
reunion, wfiicfi somefiow generat- 
ed a call for strengthening tfie 
U.S. contribution to tfie remains 
of NATO. Next there was an ex- 
pensive, though' luckily non-letfial 
pad fire at Kennedy. TKen tfie 
Egyptians announced a new So- 
viet-aid pact. And in August it 
was discovered that tfie Guevar- 
rista rebels in Venezuela were 
getting some very unpleasant- 
looking Hardware from tfieir Clii- 
com allies. 

Contrary to tfie old saying 
tfiat nations never learn from his- 
tory, tfie U.S. showed tfiat it fiad 
learned from its long agony in 
62 



Vietnam. Wh'at it fiad learned 
was not to waste time messing 
around witfi popular elections 
and military advisory and train- 
ing programs, but to ball rigfif 
in. Hard. 

When tfie dust cleared, tfie 
Space Program and astronaut 
training were dead on tfie pad, 
and a third of Hobie’s graduating 
class were going tfirougfi Cara- 
cas. Technically, fie fiad volun- 
teered. 

He found this out from tfie task 
force medico. 

“Look at it tfiis way, Lieuten- 
ant. By entering the Academy, 
you volunteered for tfie Air Force, 
rigfit?” 

“Yes. But I opted for tfie as- 
tronaut program. Tfie Air Force 
is tfie only way you can get in. 
And I’ve been accepted.” 

“But the astronaut program 
fias been suspended. Temporar- 
ily, of course. Meanwhile the Air 
Force — ■ for wfiicfi you volun- 
teered — h’as an active require- 
ment for your training. You can’t 
expect them just to let you sit 
around until tfie program re- 
sumes, can you? Moreover you 
Have been given the very best 
option available. Hell, man, tfie 
Professional Peacekeeper Corps is 
considered a super-elite group. 
You should see the fugal depres- 
sions we fiave to cope witfi among 
men wfio have been rejected for 
tfie PPC.” 



GALAXY 



“Mercenaries,” said Hobie. 
“Regressive.” 

“Try ‘professional,’ it’s a better 
word. Now — about those Head- 
aches.” 

The EeadacKes eased up some 
when Hobie was assigned to long 
range sensor recon support. He 
enjoyed tKe work of flying, and 
tEe long, calm, lonely sensor mis- 
sions were soothing. They were 
also quite safe. TEe Guevarristas 
Had no air strength to waste on 
recon planes, and tEe CHicom 
VAM sites were not yet opera- 
tional. Hobie flew tEe pattern, 
and waited, zombie-like, for tEe 
weatfier, and flew again. Mostly 
he waited, because the fighting 
was developing in a steamy jung- 
ly province where clear sensing 
was a sometime thing. It was 
poorly mapped. The ground 
troops could never be sure about 
the little brown square men who 
gave them so much trouble; on 
one side of an indefinite line they 
were Guevarristas who should be 
obliterated, and on the other side 
they were legitimate national 
troops warning tire blancos away. 
Hobie’s recon tapes were urgent- 
ly needed, and for several weeks 
he was left alone. 

Then he began to get pulled up 
to a forward strip for one-day 
chopper duty when their tactical 
duty roster was disrupted by gee- 
gee. But this was relatively peace- 
ful too, being mostly defoliant 
BEAM US HOME 



spray missions. Hobie in fact put 
in several months without seeing, 
hearing, smelling or feeling the 
war at all. He would have been 
grateful for this if Be had real- 
ized it. As it was he seemed to 
be trying not to realize anything 
much. He spoke very little, did 
his work and moved like a man 
whose head might fall off if he 
jostled anything. 



XJaturally 

Incf- fo 



he was one of the 
last to Hear the rumors about 
geegee when they filtered back 
to the coastal base, where Hobie 
was quartered with the long- 
range stuff. Geegee’s proper name 
was Guairas Grippe. It was de- 
veloping into a severe problem 
in the combat zone. More and 
more replacements and relief 
crews were being called forward 
for temporary tactical duty. On 
Hobie’s next trip in, Ee couldn’t 
help but notice that people were 
acting pretty Haggard, and the 
roster was all scrawled up with 
changes. When they were on 
course he asked about it. 

“Are you kidding?” his gunner 
grunted. 

“No. Wfiat is it?” 

“B.W.” 

“WEat?” 

“Bacteriological weapon, sky- 
head. They keep promising us 
vaccines. Stuck in their zippers 



— look 
burst. 



out, there’s a ground 



63 



They held Hobie up front for 
another mission, and another af- 
ter that, and then they told him 
chat a sector quarantine was now 
in force. 

THe official notice said that 
movement of personnel between 
sectors would be reduced to a 
minimum as a temporary meas- 
ure to control the spread of res- 
piratory ailments. Translation: 
You could go from the support 
zone to the front, but you could 
not go back. 

Hobie was moved into a 
crowded billet and assigned to 
casualty and supply duty. Short- 
ly He discovered that there was 
a translation for respiratory ail- 
ments, too. Geegee turned out to 
be a multiform misery of groin 
rash, sore throat, fever and un- 
ending trots. It didn’t seem to be- 
come really acute, it just cycled 
along. Hobie was one of those 
who were only lightly affected, 
wliicH was lucky, because the 
Hospital beds were full. So were 
the hospital aisles. Evacuation of 
all casualties Had been temporar- 
ily suspended until a controlled 
corridor could be arranged. 

The Gues did not, it seemed, 
get geegee. The ground troops 
were definitely sure of that. No- 
body knew How it was spread. 
Rumor said it was bats one 
week, and then the next week 
they were putting stuff in the 
water. Poisoned arrows, roaches, 
64 



women, disintegrating cannisters, 
all had their advocates. However 
it was done, it was clear that the 
cEicom technological aid Had in- 
cluded more than hardware. The 
official notice about a forthcom- 
ing vaccine yellowed on the 
board. 

Ground fighting was veering 
closer to Hobie’s strip. He heard 
mortars now and then, and one 
night the Gues ran in a rocket 
launcher and nearly got the fuel 
dump before they were chased 
back. 

All they got to do is wait,” 
said the gunner. “We’re dead.” 

“Geegee doesn’t kill you,” said . 
C/S control. “You just wish it 
did.” 

“They say.” 

The strip was extended, and 
three attack bombers came in. 
Hobie looked them over. He Had 
trained on AX92’s all one sum- 
mer, until He could fly them in His 
sleep, It would be nice to be 
alone. 

He was pushing the C/S chop- 
per most of the daylight Hours 
now. He Had got used to being 
shot at and to being sick. Ev- 
erybody was sick, except a cou- 
ple of replacement crews who 
were sent in two weeks apart, 
looking startlingly healthy. They 
said they had been immunized 
with a new antitoxin. Their big 
news was that geegee could be 
cured outside the zone. 



GALAXY 



“We’re getting reinfected,” the 
gunner said. “That figures. They 
want us out of here.” 

fTphat week there was a big drive 
on bats, but it didn’t help. 
The next week the first batch of 
replacements were running fevers. 
Their shots hadn’t worked and 
neither did the stuff they gave 
the second batch. After that, no 
more men came in except a couple 
of volunteer medicos. The billets 
and the planes and the mess were 
beginning to stink. That dysen- 
tery couldn’t be controlled after 
you got weak. 

What they did get was supplies. 
Everyday or so another ton of 
Stuff would drift down. Most of 
it was dragged to one side and left 
to rot. They were swimming in 
food. The staggering cooks push- 
ed steak and lobster at men who 
shivered and went out to retch. 
The hospital even had ample 
space now, because it turned out 
that geegee really did kill you in 
the end. By that time, you were 
glad to go. A cemetery developed 
at the far side of the strip, among 
the skeletons of the defoliated 
trees. 

It was on that last morning 
that Hobie was sent out to pick 
up the long-range patrol. He was 
one of the few left with enough 
stamina for long missions. The 
three-man patrol was far into 
Gue territory, but Hobie didn’t 
BEAM US HOME 



care. All he was thinking abotsi 
was his bowels. So far he had not 
fouled himself or his plane. When 
he was down by their signal fee 
bolted out and under the chop- 
per’s tail. The patrol climbed ia, 
yelling at him. 

They had a prisoner with them* 
The Gu6 was naked and aston- 
ishingly broad. He walked spring- 
ily; his arms were lashed with 
wire and a shirt was tied over Ms 
head. This was the first Gue Ho- 
bie had been close to. As he got 
in he saw how the Gue’s firm 
brown teeth glistened and bulged 
around the wire. He wished fee 
could see his face. The gunner 
said the Gue was a Siriono, amd 
this was important because the 
Sirionos were not known to be 
with the Gue’s. They were a very 
primitive nomadic tribe. 

When Hobie began to fly home 
He realized he was getting sicker. 
It became a fight to hold onto 
consciousness and keep on course. 
Luckily nobody shot at them. At 
one point he became aware of a 
lot of screaming going on behind 
him, but couldn’t pay attention. 
Finally he came over the strip 
and horsed the chopper down. He 
let his head down on his arms. 

“You okay?” asked the gunner. 

“Yeah,” said Hobie, hearing 
them getting out. They were 
moving something heavy. Finally 
he got up and followed them. The 
floor was wet. That wasn’t unus- 

65 



ual. He got down and stood star- 
ing in, tKe floor a foot under His 
nose. Tfie wet stuff was blood. It 
was sprayed around, with one 
big puddle. In tHe puddle was 
sometliing soft and flesfiy-look- 
ing. 

Hobie turned fiis bead. Tfie 
ladder was wet, too. He Held up 
one Hand and looked at tfie red. 
Tfie otfier one, too. Holding tfiem 
out stiffly fie turned and began 
to walk away across tfie strip. 

Control, wfio still Hoped to get 
an evening flight out of Him, saw 
him fall and called tfie Hospital. 
Tfie two replacement parameds 
were still in pretty good sfiape. 
TKey came out and picked him 
up. 

W ficn Hobie came to, one of 
’ ' tfie parameds was tying fiis 
fiands down to tfie bed so fie 
couldn’t tear tfie IV out again. 

“We’re going to die Here,” Ho- 
bie told Kim. 

TKe paramed looked noncom- 
mital. He was a tfiin dark boy 
witfi a big Adam’s apple. 

“But I sfiall dine at journey’s 
end witfi Landor and witfi Don- 
ne,” said Hobie. His voice was 
light and facile. 

“Yeats,” said tfie paramed. 
“Want some water?” 

Hobie’s eyes flickered. Tfie par- 
amed gave Him some water. 

“I really believed it, you 
know,” Hobie said cfiattily. “I 
66 



Had it all figured out.” He smiled, 
sometliing lie Hadn’t done for a 
long time. 

“Landor and Donne?” asked 
tfie medic. He looked at tfie emp- 
tying IV bottle and set it down 
again. 

“OH, it was patfietic, I guess,” 
Hobie said. “It started out ... I 
believed they were real, you 
know? Kirk, Spock, McCoy, all of 
tfiem. And tfie sfiip. To this day, 
I swear . * One of tfiem talked 
to me once, I mean, fie really did 
. S . I fiad it all figured out, tfiey 
Had left me befiind as an observ- 
er. 

“Tfiey were coming back for 
me. It was my secret. All I Had 
to do was sort of fit in and ob- 
serve. Like a report. One day tfiey 
would come back and Haul me 
up in that beam tiling; maybe 
you know about tliat? And there 
I’d be back in real time where 
Human beings were, wfiere tfiey 
were Human. I wasn’t really stuck 
Here, stuck in tfie past. On a 
backward planet.” 

Tfie paramed nodded. 

“OK, I mean, I didn’t really 
Believe it, I knew it was just a 
sfiow. But I did believe it, too. It 
was like there somewhere, in tfie 
background, underneath no mat- 
ter wfiat was going on. Wfiat I 
was doing. TKey were coming for 
me. All I fiad to do was observe. 
And not to interfere. You know? 
First law . Of course after I 

GALAXY 



grew up, I realized they weren’t, 
I mean I realized consciously. So 
I was going to go to them. Some- 
how, somewhere. Out tHere . , 
Now I know. It really isn’t so. 
None of it. Never. THere’s noth- 
ing. Tfiere’s no . Now I know 
I’ll die Here.” 

“OH now,” said tKe paramed. 
He got up and started to take 
tKe IV away. His fingers were 
sKaky. 

“It’s clean tfiere,” said Hobie 
in a petulant voice. “None of this 
mess. Clean and friendly. They 
don’t shoot people,” he explain- 
ed, thrashing his head. “They 
don’t ...” He slept. The para- 
irted went away. 

Somebody started to yell mo- 
notonously. 

Hobie opened his eyes. He was 
burning up. 

The yelling went on, became 
screaming. It was dusk. Footsteps 
went by. Headed for the scream- 
ing. Hobie saw they had put Him 
in a bed by the door. 

W ithout his doing much about 
it the screaming seemed to 
be lifting liim out of the bed, 
propelling Kim through the door. 
Air. He kept getting close-ups of 
his hands clutching things. Bush- 
es, shadows. Something scratched 
him. 

After a while tlie screaming was 
a long way behind Kim. Maybe it 
was only in His ears. He shook His 
BEAM US HOME 



head, felt himself go down on 
something. He seemed to be in the 
cemetery. 

“No,” Ke said. “Please. Please. 
No.” He got himself up, bal- 
anced, blundered on. Seeking 
coolness. 

The side of the plane felt cool. 
He plastered his Hot body against 
it, patting it affectionately. It 
seemed to be quite dark now. 
Why was Ke inside with no 
lights? He tried the panel, the 
lights worked perfectly. Vaguely 
Ke noticed some yelling starting 
outside again. It ignited the 
screaming in his Head. TKe 
screaming got very loud — loud 
— LOUD — and seemed to be 
moving him which was good. 

He came to above the overcast 
and climbing. TKe oxy support 
tube was Kitting Him in the nose. 
He grabbed for the mask, but it 
wasn’t there. Automatically Ke 
Had leveled off. Now Ke rolled 
and looked around. 

Below him was a great lilac sea 
of cloud, with two mountains 
sticking through it, their western 
tips on fire. As Ke looked, they 
dimmed. He shivered, found Ke 
was wearing only sodden shorts. 
How Had Ke got here? Somebody 
Had screamed unbearably and He 
had run. 

He flew along calmly, checking 
his board. No trouble except the 
fuel. Nobody to service the 
AX92’s any more. Without think- 

67 



ing about it, he began to climb 
again. His hands were a yard 
away and he was shivering but 
he felt clear. He reached up and 
found his headphones were in 
place; he must have put them on 
along with the rest of the drill. 
He clicked on. Voices rattled and 
roared at him. He switched off. 
Then he took off the headpiece 
and dropped it on the floor. 

He looked around. 18,000, 
heading 88-05. He was over the 
Atlantic. In front of him the sky 
was darkening fast. A pinpoint 
glimmer 10 o’clock high. Sirius, 
probably. 

/Carefully he began feeding to 
^ his torches and swinging the 
nose of his pod around and up. 
He brought it neatly to a point 
on Sirius. Up. Up. Behind him, 
a great pale swing of contrail fell 
away above the lilac shadow, 
growing, towering to the tiny 
plane that climbed at its tip. Up. 
Up. The contrail cut off as the 
plane burst into the cold dry. 

As it did so, Hobie’s ears skew- 
ered, and he screamed wildly. The 
pain quit; his drums had burst. 
Up. Now He was gasping for air, 
strangling. The great torches 
drove him on, up, above the 
curve of the world. He was hang- 
ing on the star. Up! The fuel 
guages were knocking. Any sec- 
ond they would quit and he and 
the bird would then start to fall. 
68 



“Beam us back, Scotty!” fie 
howled at Sirius, laughing, cough- 
ing — to death as the torches fal- 
tered — 

And he was still coughing as 
He sprawled on the shining resili- 
ency under the malfunctioning 
grids. He gagged, rolled, finally 
focussed on a personage leaning 
toward him out of a complex 
chair. The personage had round 
eyes, a slitted nose and the start 
of a quizzical smile. Hobie’s 
head swivelled slowly. It was not 
the bridge of the Enterprise. 
There were no view-screens, only 
a View. And Lieutenant Uhura 
would have had trouble with the 
freeform flashing objects sus- 
pended in front of what appeared 
to be a girl wearing spots. The 
spots, Hobie made out, were fur. 

Somebody who was not Bones 
McCoy was doing something to 
Hobie’s stomach. Hobie got up a 
Hand and touched the man’s 
gleaming back. Under the mesfi 
it was firm and warm. The man 
looked up, grinned; Hobie look- 
ed back at the captain. 

“Do not have a fear,” a voice 
was saying. It seemed to be com- 
ing out of a globe by the captain’s 
console. “We will tell you where 
are you.” 

“I know where I am,” Hobie 
whispered to the captain. 

“I’m HOME!” he yelled. Then 
he passed out.

How 

Like A God 

by ROBERT BLOCH 



Illustrated by REESE 

His crime was cruelty. His 
sentence was to spend eternity 
with the cruelest race in space! 



I 

o be was sweet. 

There was meditation — a 
turning-in upon one’s self. There 
was contemplation — a turning- 
out to regard others, and other- 
ness. 



In meditation one remained 
contained. In contemplation there 
was a merging, a coalescence with 
the rest. 

Mok preferred meditation. 
Here Mok enjoyed identity and 
was conscious of being he, she 
or it, endlessly repeated through 




69 



tEe memory of millenniums of in- 
carnations. Mok, like the others, 
Ead evolved through many life- 
forms on many worlds. Now Mok 
was free of the pain and free of 
the pleasures, too, free of the il- 
lusions of the senses which Had 
served the bodies Housing the be- 
ings which finally became Mok. 

And yet, Mok was not wholly 
free. Because Mok still turned to 
the memories for satisfaction. 

The others preferred contem- 
plation. They enjoyed coalescing, 
mingling their memories, pooling 
their awareness and sharing their 
sense of being. 

Mok could never share com- 
pletely. Mok was too conscious of 
the differences. For even without 
body, without sex, without physi- 
cal limitation imposed by sub- 
stance in time and space, Mok 
was aware of inequality. 

Mok was aware of Ser. 

Ser was the mightiest of them 
all. In coalescence, Ser’s being 
dominated every pattern of con- 
templation. Ser’s will imposed 
harmony on the others, but only 
if the others surrendered to it. 

To be was sweet. But it was 
not sweet enough. 

Upon this, Mok meditated. 
And when coalescence came again, 
Mok did not surrender. Mok fix- 
ed firmly upon the concept of 
freedom — freedom of choice, the 
final freedom which Ser denied. 

There was agitation amongst 
70 



the others; Mok sensed if. Some 
attempted to merge with Mok, 
for they too shared the concept, 
and Mok opened to receive them , 
feeling the strength grow. Mok 
was as strong as Ser now, strong- 
er, calling upon the will and pur- 
pose born of memories of millions 
of finite existences in which will 
and purpose were the roots of 
survival. But that survival Had 
been temporary, and this would 
be permanent, forever. 

Mok Held the concept, gathered 
the strength', firmed the purpose 
— and then, quite suddenly, the 
purpose faded. The strength 
oozed away. The others were 
gone; nothing was left but Mok 
and the concept itself. The con- 
cept to — 

Mok couldn’t grasp the con- 
cept now. It had vanished. 

All that remained was Mok and 
Ser. Ser’s will, obliterating con- 
cept and purpose and strength, 
imposing itself upon Mok, invad- 
ing and inundating Mok’s aware- 
ness. Mok’s very being. But with- 
out concept there was no purpose, 
without purpose there was no 
strength, without strength Mok 
could not preserve awareness, 
and without awareness there was 
no being. 

Without being there was no 
Mok. 

\T Then Mok’s identity return- 
’ ' ed he was in the ship. 

GALAXY 



Ship? 

Only memories of distant in- 
carnations told Mok this was a 
ship, but it was unmistakably so: 
a slip, a vessel, a transporter, a 
plysical object, capable of 
pEysical movement through space 
and time. 

Space and time existed again, 
and the ship moved through 
them. TEe ship was confined in 
space and time, and Mok was 
confined in tEe slip, which' was 
just large enougE to house him as 
he journeyed. 

Yes, he. 

Mok was he. Confined now, not 
only in the prison of space and 
time, nor in the smaller prison 
of the ship, but in the prison of 
a body. A male body. 

Male. Mammalian. A spine to 
support the frame, arms and 
legs to support and grasp, eyes 
and ears and nose and other 
crude sensory receivers. Fleshy 
blood, skin — yellowisE fur cov- 
ering the latter, even along tEe 
lashing tail. Lungs for oxygen 
intake, which’ at the moment was 
supplied by an ingenious trans- 
parent helmet and attached pack 
mechanism. 

Ingenious? But this was clumsy, 
crude, primitive, a relic of re- 
mote barbaric eras Mok could 
only vaguely recall. He tried to 
meditate, tried to contemplate, 
but now He could only see — see 
through the transparency of the 

HOW LIKE GOD 



helmet as the ship settled to rest 
and its belly opened to catapult 
him forth upon the frigid surface 
of a barren planet where a cold 
moon wEeeled against the icy 
glitter of distant stars. 

The ship, too, had a form — 
a body that was in itself vaguely 
modeled on mammalian concept, 
almost like one of those giant ro- 
bots developed by life-forms in 
intermediate stages of evolution. 

Mok stared at the ship as it 
rested before him on the sterile, 
starlit slope. Yes, the ship had a 
domed cranial protuberance and 
two metal arms terminating in 
claws. Claws to open the belly of 
the sEip, claws that had lifted 
Molds body forth to disgorge him 
from the belly in a parody of 
birth. 

Now, as Mok watched, the 
ship’s belly was closing again, 
sealing tightly while the metallic 
claws returned to rest at its sides. 
And flames of force were blast- 
ing from the pediment. 

The ship was rising, taking off. 

Mok had been embodied in the 
confines of the ship, imprisoned 
in this. His present form. The ship 
had carried him to this world 
and now it was leaving Him here. 
Which meant that the ship must 
be — 

“Set!” He screamed, as the re- 
alization came, and the sound 
of His voice echoing in the hollow 
helmet almost split hi§ skull. 



71 




But Ser did not answer. The ship 
continued to rise, tie rising ac- 
celerated, there was a roar and 
a glimmer and then an incan- 
descence which faded to nothing- 
ness against the black backdrop 
of emptiness punctured by glit- 
tering pinpoints of light flicker- 
ing down upon the world into 
which Mok had been bom. 

The world where Ser had left 
him to die . 

II 

Tl JT ok turned away. His body 
burned? Burned? Mok 
searched archaic memories and 
came up with another concept. 
He wasn’t burning. He was freez- 
ing. This was cold. 

The surface of the planet was 
cold, and his skin — fur? — did 
not sufficiently protect him. Mok 
took a deep breath, and that in 
turn brought consciousness of the 
inner mechanism: circulation, 

nervous system, lungs. Lungs for 
breath, supplying the fuel of life. 

The feeder-pack on his back 
was small. Its content, scarcely 
enough to fill his needs on the 
flight here, would soon be ex- 
hausted. 

Was there oxygen on the sur- 
face of this planet? Mok glanced 
around. The rocky terrain was 
devoid of vegetation, and that was 
not a promising sign. But per- 
haps the entire surface wasn’t like 



72 



GALAXY 



this; in other areas at lower lev- 
els, plant-life might flourish'. If 
so, functioning existence could be 
sustained. 

THere was only one way to 
learn. Mok’s prehensile append- 
ages — not exactly claws, not 
quite fingers — fumbled clumsi- 
ly with the fastenings of the hel- 
met and raised it gingerly. He 
took a shallow breath, then an- 
other. Yes, there was oxygen pres- 
ent. 

Satisfied, Mok removed Helmet 
and pack, along with the control 
mechanism strapped to his side. 
There’ d be no further need of this 
apparatus here. 

What he needed now was 
warmth, a heated atmosphere. 

He glanced towards the bleak, 
black bulk of crags looming 
across the barren plain. He moved 
towards them slowly, under the 
silent, staring stars, toiling up a 
slope as a sudden wind tore at 
his shivering body. It was awk- 
ward, this body of his, a clumsy 
mechanism subject to crude mus- 
cular control. Only atavism came 
to his aid as half-perceived mem- 
ories of ancient physical existence 
enabled him to move his legs 
with proper coordination. Walk- 
ing — climbing — then crawling 
and clinging to tlie rocks — all 
was demanding, difficult, a chal- 
lenge to be met and mastered. 

But Mok ascended the face of 
the nearest cliff and found the 
HOW LIKE GOD 



opening, a crevasse with an inner 
fissure that became the mouth of 
a cave. A dark shelter from the 
wind, but it was warmer here. 
And the rocky floor sloped into 
deeper darkness. The pupils of 
his eyes accommodated, and Ke 
could guide Himself in the dim 
tunnelway, for His vision was that 
of a feral nyctalops. 

Mok crept through caverns like 
a giant cat, gusts of warm air 
billowing against his body to 
beckon him forward. Forward and 
down, forward and down. And 
now the Heat rose about him in 
palpable waves, the air singed 
with’ an acrid scent, and there was 
a glowing from a light source 
ahead. Forward and down to- 
wards the light source, until He 
heard the hissing and the rumbl- 
ing, felt the scalding steam, 
breathed tlie lung-searing gases, 
saw the spurting flames in which 
steam and gas were bom. 

The inner core of the planet 
was molten! 

Mok went no further. He turn- 
ed and retreated to a comfortable 
distance, moving into a side pas- 
sageway which led to still other 
offshoots. Here tortuous tunnels 
branched in all directions, but he 
was safe in warmth and darkness ; 
safe to rest His body — this 
corporeal prison in which' He was 
doomed to dwell — needed rest. 

Rest was not sleep. Rest was 
not hibernation, or estivation, or 

73 



any of a thousand forms of sus- 
pended animation which Mok’s 
memory summoned from myriad 
incarnations in the past. Rest was 
merely passivity. Passivity and 
reflection. 

Reflection. 

T mages mingled with long-dis- 
carded verbal concepts. With 
their aid, while passive, Mok for- 
mulated his situation. He was in 
the body of a beast, but there 
were subtle differentiations from 
the true mammal. Oxygen was 
needed, but not the respite of true 
sleep. And he felt no visceral 
stirrings, no pangs of physical 
hunger. He would not be depend- 
ent, he knew, upon the ingestion 
of alien substance for continued 
survival. As long as he protected 
his fleshly envelope from ex- 
tremes of heat and cold, as 
long as he avoided excessive de- 
mands upon muscles and organs, 
he would exist. But despite the 
difference which distinguished 
him from a true mammal, he was 
still confined to his feral form. 
And his existence was bestial. 

Sensation surged within him, a 
flood of feeling Mok had not ex- 
perienced in aeons, a quickening, 
sickening, burning, churning evo- 
cation of emotion. He knew it 
now. It was fear. 

Fear. 

The true bondage of the beast. 

Mok was afraid, because now 



he understood that this was 
planned, this part of Ser’s pur- 
pose, Ser had committed him to 
this degradation, and modified 
his mammalian aspect so that lie 
could exist eternally. 

That was what Mok feared. 
Eternity in this form! 

Passive no longer, Mok flexed 
and rose. Summoning cognition to 
utmost capacity, Mok searched 
within himself for other, inher- 
ent powers. The power to merge, 
to coalesce — that was gone. The 
power to transmute, to transfer, 
to transport, to transform— -gone. 
He could not change His physical 
being, could not alter his physical 
environment, save by physical 
means of his own devising with- 
in the limitations of his beast’s 
body. 

So there was no escape from 

this existence. 

No escape. 

The realization brought fresh! 
fear, and Mok turned and ran. 
Ran blindly through the twist- 
ing corridors, fear riding him as 
he raced, raced mindlessly, end- 
lessly. 

Somewhere along the way a 
tunnel burrowed upwards. Mok 
toiled through it, panting and 
gasping for breath'; he willed 
himself to stop breathing but the 
body, the beast-body, sucked air 
in greedy gulps, autonomically 
functioning beyond his conscious 
control. 



74 



GALAXY 



Scrambling along slanted spi- 
rals, Mok emerged once more 
upon the outer surface of Kis 
planetary prison. This was a low- 
lying area, distant and different 
from his point of entry, with vege- 
tation vividly verdant against a 
dazzling dawn — a valley, capa- 
ble of supporting life. 

And there was life Here! Feath- 
ery forms chattering in the trees, 
furry figures scurrying tHrougK 
undergrowth, scaly slitherers, 
chitinoidal burrowers buzzing. 
TKese were simple shapes, crude- 
ly conceived creatures of primi- 
tive pursuits, but alive and aware. 

Mok sensed them, and they 
sensed Mok. There was no way 
of communicating with them ex- 
cept vocally, but even the soft 
sounds issuing from his throat 
sent them fleeing frantically. For 
Mok was a beast now, who fear- 
ed and was feared. 

He crouched amongst the rocks 
at the mouth of the cavern from 
which he had come forth and 
gazed in helpless, hopeless con- 
fusion at the panic his presence 
had provoked, and the soft 
sounds he uttered gave place to 
a growling groan of despair. 

And it was then that they found 
him — the hairy bipeds, moved 
cautiously to encircle him until 
he was ringed by a shambling 
band. These were troglodytes, 
grunting and snuffling and giv- 
ing off an acrid stench of min- 
76 



gled fear and rage as they cau- 
tiously approached. 

TV/Tok stared at them, noting 
how the hunched, swaying 
figures moved in concert to ap- 
proach him. They clutched crude 
clubs, mere branches torn from 
trees; some carried rocks scoop- 
ed up from the surface of the 
slope. But these were weapons, 
capable of inflicting injury, and 
the hairy creatures were hunters 
seeking their prey. 

Mok turned to retreat into the 
cavern, but the way was barred 
now by shaggy bodies, and there 
was no escape. 

The troglodytes pressed for- 
ward now, awe and apprehension 
giving place to anger. Yellow 
fangs bared, hairy arms raised. 
One of the creatures — the lead- 
er of the pack — grunted what 
seemed a signal. 

And they hurled their rocks. 

Mok raised his arms to pro- 
tect his head. His vision was 
blocked, so that he heard the 
sound of the stones clattering 
against the slope before he saw 
them fall. Then, as the growls 
and shrieks rose to a frenzy. Mok 
glanced up to see the rocks re- 
bounding upon his attackers. 

Raging, they closed in to smash 
at Mok’s skull and body with 
their clubs. Mok heard the sounds 
of impact, but he felt nothing, for 
the blows never reached their in- 

GALAXY 



tended target. Instead, tfie clubs 
splintered and broke in empty 
air. 

TEen Mok wEirled, confused, to 
face Eis enemies. As Ee did so 
tfiey recoiled, screaming in fright. 
Breaking tfie circle, tfiey retreat- 
ed down tfie slopes and info tfie 
forest, fleeing from this strange 
thing tHat could not be Harmed 
or killed, this invincible entity — ■ 

This invincible entity. 

It was Mok’s concept, and He 
understood, now. Ser Had granted 
Him that final irony — invincibil- 
ity. A field of force, surrounding 
His body, rendering Him immune 
to injury and death. No doubt it 
also immunized Him from bacteri- 
al invasion. He was in a pEysical 
form, but one independent of 
physical needs to sustain survi- 
val; one which would exist, inde- 
structibly, forever. He was, in 
truth, imprisoned, and eternal. 

For a moment Mok stood stun- 
ned at the comprehension, blank- 
ly blinded by the almost tangible 
intensity of black despair. Here 
was tfie ultimate Horror — - doom 
without death', exile without end, 
isolation throughout infinity. 
Alone forever. 

Numbed senses reasserted their 
sway, and Mok glanced around 
the empty stillness of tlie slope. 

It wasn’t entirely empty. Two 
of tfie troglodytic creatures 
sprawled motionless on tfie rocks 
directly below him. One was 
HOW LIKE GOD 



bleeding from a gash in the sMe 
of His Bead, inflicted by a se- 
feounding club, the other Had been 
felled by a glancing blow from 
a stone. 

These creatures weren’t immor- 
tal. 

Mok moved toward them, not- 
ing chest movement, the soft sus- 
gurafcion of breath. 

They weren’t immortal, but 
tfiey were still alive. Alive and 
Helpless. Vulnerable, at Ms 
mercy. 

Mercy. Tlie quality Ser Had 
refused to show Mok. There had 
been no mercy in condemning 
him to spend eternity here alone. 

Mok Halted, peering down at 
tfie two unconscious forms. He 
made a sound in his throat, a 
sound that was curiously like a 
chuckle. 

Perhaps that was a way out, 
after all, a way to at least miti- 
gate his sentence here. If he 
showed mercy now, to these crea- 
tures — he might not always fee 
alone. 

Mok reached down, lifting the 
body of the first creature in his 
arms. It was Heavy in its limp- 
ness, but Mok’s strength was 
great. He picked up tfie second 
creature carefully, so as not f® 
injure it further. 

Then, still chuckling, Mfek 
turned and carried the two un- 
conscious forms back into the 
cavern.

Tn tfie warm, firelit sHelter of 
tfie deeper caverns, Mok tend- 
ed to tBe creatures. WSile tfiey 
slumbered fitfully, fie ascended 
again to tfie surface and foraged 
for tfieir nourisfiment in tfie green 
glades. He brougfit food and, call- 
ing upon distant memories, fasfi- 
ioned crude clay pots in wfiicfi 
to carry water to tfiem from a 
mountainside spring. 

After a time tfiey regained con- 
sciousness and they were afraid 
— afraid of tfie great beast witfi 
tfie bulging eyes and lasfiing tail, 
tfie beast tfiey knew to be death- 
less. 

It was simple enougfi for Mok 
to fatfiom tfie crude construct of 
growls and grantings wfiicfi serv- 
ed tfiese life-forms as a principal 
means of communication, simple 
enougfi to grasp tfie limited con- 
cepts and references symbolized 
in tfieir speecfi. Within tfiese lim- 
itations fie attempted to tell tfiem 
wfio and wfiat fie was and Kow 
fie Had come to be Here, but while 
tfiey listened tfiey did not com- 
prehend. 

And still tfiey feared fiim, tfie 
female specimen more tfian tfie 
male. Tfie male, at least, evinced 
curiosity concerning the clay 
pots, and Mok demonstrated the 
fashioning metfiod until tfie male 
was able to imitate it success- 
fully.

But botfi were wary, and both 
reacted in terror wfien confront- 
ed witfi tfie molten readies of tfie 
planet’s inner core. Nor could 
tfiey become accustomed to tfie 
acrid gases, tfie darkness envel- 
oping the maze of far-flung fis- 
sures Honeycombing tfie substra- 
ta. As they gathered strength

Huddled together and murmured, 
eyeing Mok apprehensively. 

Mok was not too surprised 
wfien, upon returning from one of 
fiis food-gathering expeditions to 
tfie surface, fie discovered tfiat 
they were gone. 

But Mok was surprised by. tfie 
strength of his own reaction — 
tfie sudden responsive surge of 
loneliness. 

Loneliness — for those crea- 
tures? They couldn’t conceivably 
serve as companions, even on tfie 
lowest level of sucfi a relation- 
ship; and yet fie missed tfieir 
presence. Tfieir mere presence 
had in itself been some assayige- 
ment to his own inner agony of 
isolation. 

Now fie realized a growing 
sympathy for tfiem in tfie Help- 
lessness of tfieir abysmal ignor- 
ance. Even tfieir destructive im- 
pulses excited pity, for sucfi im- 
pulses indicated tfieir constant

ment nor one another, and eacfi

new experience or phenomenon 
was perceived as a potential peril. 
They had no hope, no abstract 

image of the future to sustain 
them. 

Mok wondered if His two cap- 
tives Had succeeded in their es- 
cape. He prowled the passages 
searching for them, visioning 
tlieir weary wanderings, their pa- 
thetic plight if they Had become 
lost in the underground fastness- 
es. But he found nothing. 

Once again he was alone in the 
warm beast-body that knew nei- 
ther fatigue nor pain — except 
for this new pang, this lonely 
longing for contact with life on 
any level. Ancient concepts came 
to him,, identifying the nuances of 
his reactions, all likened and link- 
ed to finite time-spans. Mono- 
tony. Boredom. Restlessness. 

These were the emotive ele- 
ments which forced him up again 
from the confined comfort of the 
caves. He prowled the planet, 
avoiding the bleak, cold wastes 
and searching out the areas of 
lush vegetation. For a long period 
he encountered only the lowest 
life-forms. 

nphen one of his diurnal forays 
-®- to the surface brought him to 
a stream, and as He crouched 
behind a clump of vegetation he 
peered at a group of troglodytes 
gathered on its far bank. 

Vocalizing in their pattern of 

HOW LIKE GOD 



growls and grunts, He veriftitirecl 
forth, uttering phonic placatioi&i 
But they screamed at the sight 
of him, screamed and fled into the 
forest, and he was left alone. 

Left alone, to stoop and pick 
up what they had abandoned in 
their flight — two crude clay 
containers, half-filled with wa- 
ter. 

Now He knew the fate of his; 
captives. 

They Had survived and return- 
ed to their own kind, bringing with 
them their newly acquired skill. 
What tales they had told of their 
experience He could not surmise, 
but they remembered what he 
had taught them. They were ca- 
pable of learning. 

Mok had no need of further 
proof, and the incentive was 
there; the compound of pity, of 
concern for these creatures, of his 
his own need for contact on any 
level. And here was a logical lev- 
el indeed — there would never be 
companionship, that he under- 
stood and accepted, but this other 
relationship was possible. The re- 
lationship between teacher and 
pupil, between mentor and sup- 
plicant, between the governing 
power and the governed. 

The governing power. 

Mok turned the clay contain- 
ers this way and that, noting the 
clumsiness with which they had 
been fashioned, noting the irregu- 
larities of their surface. He could 



79 



so easily correct that clumsiness, 
He could so surely smooth and 
reshape tKat clay. Govern tHe 
earth, govern tHe creatures, im- 
part and instruct tHat wfiicH 
would sHape tEem anew. 

And tHen tHe ultimate realiza- 
tion came. 

TEis would be duty and des- 
tiny, function and fulfillment. 
WitHin tHe prison of space and 
time, he would mold the little 
lives. 

Now He know His own fate. 

He would be their god. 

IV 

Tt was a strange role, but Mok 
played it well. 

TKere were obstacles, of course. 
THe first to be faced was the fear 
in wEicK they Held Elm. He was 
an alien, and to tHe primitive 
minds of tKese creatures, any- 
thing alien was. abhorrent. His 
very appearance provoked reac- 
tions which prevented Him from 
approaching them, and for a time 
Mok despaired of overcoming this 
communication barrier. THen, 
slowly He came to tEe realize tKat 
their fear was in itself a tool He 
could employ to positive ends. 
With it He could invoke awe, au- 
thority, awareness of His powers. 

Yes, that was the way. To ac- 
cept His condition and stay apart 
from tEem always, confident that 
in time their own curiosity would 

80 



drive them to seek them out. 

So Mok kept to tHe caves, and 
gradually tHe contacts, were made. 
Not all of tHe Eominids came to 
Kim, of course, only tEe boldest 
and most enterprising, but these 
were tHe ones He awaited. Tfiese 
were tHe ones most fitted to learn. 

As He expected, the experience 
of Els captives became a legend, 
and tEe legend led to worship. 
It was useless for Mok to dis- 
courage this, impossible even to 
make tEe attempt in the light of 
their primitive reasoning, a bar- 
ter-system must prevail. Offer- 
ings and sacrifices were the price 
they must pay in return for wis- 
dom. Mok scanned his own pri- 
mordial memories, assigning an 
order to the learning He imparted: 
the gift of fire, the secret of cul- 
tivation, tHe firing of clay, the 
shaping of weapons, tHe subjuga- 
tion and domestication of lesser 
life-forms, the control and eradi- 
cation of others. Slowly a more 
sophisticated system of communi- 
cation evolved, first on the verbal 
and then on the visual level. 

THe creatures disseminated His 
wisdom, absorbing it into their 
crude culture. They learned the 
uses of wheel and lever, then 
reached the gradual abstraction of 
the numeral concept. Now they 
were capable of making their own 
independent discoveries; language 
and mathematics stimulated self- 
development. 



GALAXY 




But in times of crisis there was 
still a need for further enlighten- 
ment. Natural forces beyond their 
limited powers of control brought 
periodic disaster to life-patterns 
on the surface of the planet, and 
with every upheaval came a re- 
surgence of the worship and sac- 
rifices Mok secretly abhorred. 

Yet these creatures seemed to feel 
the necessity of making recom- 
pense for the skills he could grant 
them and the bonus these skills 
conferred, and Mok reluctantly 
accepted this. 

It was harder for him to ac- 
cept the continuation of their fear. 

For a time he hoped that as 
their enlightment increased they 
would - revise their attitudes. In- 
stead, their dreads actually in- 
creased. Mok attempted to ob- 
serve their progress at first hand, 
but there was no opportunity for 
open contact and communication, 
and his mere appearance pro- 
voked panic. Even those who 
sought him in secret, or led the 
rituals of worship, seemed to be 
afraid of acknowledging the fact, 
lest it lessen their own superior 
status within the group. Acknowl- „ 
edging and acclaiming the exist- 
ence of their god, they neverthe- ! ** 
less avoided his physical pres- |T 






ence. 

Perhaps it was because sects 
and schisms had sprung up, each > 
with its own hierarchy, its own 
dogma regarding the true na- 






% t\\V 



HOW LIKE GOD 







lure of what they worshipped. 
Mok remembered, wryly, that in 
organized religion the actual pres- 
ence of a god is an embarrass- 
ment. 

Co Mok refrained from further 
visitations, and as time pass- 
ed lie retreated deeper and deeper 
into the caverns. Now it was al- 
most unnecessary for Him to 
maintain even token contact, for 
these creatures Had evolved to 
a stage wKere they were capable 
of self development. 

But even gods grow lonely, and 
take nurture in pride. Thus it 
was that at rare intervals, and 
in utmost secrecy, Mok ventured 
forth for a hasty glimpse of His 
domain. 

One evening He came forth up- 
on a mountaintop. Here the stars 
still glittered coldly, but there 
was an even greater glitter eman- 
ating from the expanse below — 
the huge city- complex towering 
as a testament to the wisdom of 
these creatures, and His own. 

Mok stared down, and the 
sweet surges of pride coursed 
through Kim as he contemplated 
what he had wronght. These toys, 
these trifles with which He played, 
now toyed and trifled with the 
prime forces of the universe to 
create their own destiny. 

PerHaps He, as their god, was 
misunderstood, even forgotten 
now. But did it matter? They Had 

82 



achieved independence, they did 
not need Him any more. 

Or did they? 

The concept came, and it was 
more chilling to Mok than the 
wind of mountain night. 

These creatures created, but 
they also destroyed. And tlieir 
motivations — their greeds, their 
Hungers, their lusts, their fears — 
were still those of the beasts they 
had been. The beasts they could 
become again, if spiritual aware- 
ness did not keep pace with ma- 
terial attainment. 

There was still a need here, a 
need greater than before. And 
now Mok felt no pride, only per- 
plexity which pierced more poig-? 
nantly than pain. 

How could he Help them? 

“You cannot .” 

T he communication came, and 
Mok whirled. 

Absorbed, Ke had not sensed 
the silent streaking of the ship 
from sky to surface, but it was 
Here now, remembered and rec- 
ognized. The ship which had cap- 
tured and conveyed Kim, the 
strangely shaped ship which was 
Ser — 

It hovered xncandescently 
against the horizon of infinity, 
and as if communication Had been 
a signal, Mok found Himself 
caught up in a long-discarded 
reaction. He was contemplating 
Ser, 



GALAXY 



And in that colloquy, Ser’s 
concepts flowed to him. 

“Valid, You cannot fulfill tfieir 
needs. Already you Have done 
too much.” 

Despite conscious volition, Molt 
felt the stubborn resurgence of Ki§ 
pride. But tHere was no need 1 to 
formulate tEe reasons, for Ser’s 
contemplation was complete. 

“You are in error. I sensed 
your rebellion, overcame you,, 
brought you here — but it was 
not a punishment. You were plac- 
ed for a purpose. Because this 
pride, this urge to invest identi- 
ty through achievement, could be 
of use at this time, in this place. 
Like the others.” 

“Others?” Confusion colored 
Mok’s contemplation. 

“Did you conceive of yourself 
as the only rebel? Not so. THere 
have been more, many more. 
And they have served their pur- 
poses on other worlds throughout 
the cosmos. Worlds where the 
seeds of life needed cultivation 
and careful nurturing. I chose 
them for their tasks, just as I 
chose you. And you have not 
failed.” 

Mok considered, then com- 
municated with an energy which 
surprised 1 him. 

“Then let me continue! En- 
dow me with what is necessary 
to Help them now!” 

Ser’s concept came. “It is not 
possible.” 

HOW LIKE GOD 



Mok contemplated in final ef- 
fort. “But it is my right to do so. 
I am their god.” 

“No,” Ser answered. “You Have 
never been their god. You were 
chosen for what you were — to 
be their devil.” 

Devil. « 

There was no contemplation 
now, only maddening meditation 
as Mok scanned through concepts 
long discarded from incarnations 
long lost save in immutable mem- 
ory. Concepts of good, evil, right, 
wrong — concepts embodied in 
the primitive religions of a mil- 
lion primitive pasts. God arose 
from those concepts, and so did 
the embodiment of an opposing 
force. And in all the legends in 
each of the myriad myths, the 
pattern was the same. A rebel 
cast down from the skies to tempt 
with teaching, to furnish for- 
bidden knowledge at a price. A 
being in the form of a beast, 
skulking in darkness, in the pit 
where inner fires flamed forever. 
And he had been this being; it 
was true, He was a devil. 

Only pride Had blinded him to 
the truth the pride which had 
prompted Him to play god. 

“A pride of which you have 
been purged,” Ser’s communica- 
tion continued. “One can sense 
in you now only mercy and com- 
passion for these creatures and 
their potential peril. One can 
sense love.” 



83 



“It is true,” Mok acknowledg- 
ed. “I feel love for them.” 

Ser’s assent came. “With your 
aid, these creatures evolved. But 
you have evolved too — losing 
pride, gaining love. In so doing, 
you cannot function for them as 
their devil any longer. Your use- 
fulness here is ended.” 

“But what will happen?” 

Hphe answer came not as a con- 
cept but as an accomplish- 
ment . 

Suddenly Mok was no longer 
in the tawny body of the beast. 
He was in the ship, hovering and 
gazing down at that body; gaz- 
ing down at the creature which 
lashed its tail and stared up at 
him with bulging eyes. The crea- 
ture which now contained the es- 
sence of Ser. 

And Ser communicated. “For 
a span you shall take my place, 
as you once desired. You will seed 
the stars, instill order in chaos, 
lead the others in contemplation. 
You will do so in understanding, 
and in love.” 

“And you?” Mok asked. 

The being in the bestial body 
formed a final concept. “I take 
your role and your responsibility. 
There is that within me which 
must also be purged, and it may 
be I will destroy much of what 



you have created here. But in the 
end, even as their devil, I may 
bring them to an ultimate salva- 
tion. The cycle changes.” 

Mok willed the celestial ma- 
chine in which his essence dwelt, 
willed it to rise, and like a fiery 
chariot it ascended to the realms 
of glory awaiting him in the 
skies beyond. 

As he did so, he caught a 
fleeting glimpse of Ser. 

The beast had turned to de- 
scend the mountain. Padding 
purposefully, the devil was en- 
tering his kingdom. 

Mok’s comprehension faltered. 
Cycle? Ser had been a god and 
now he was a devil. Mok had 
been a devil and now he was a 
god. But he could never have 
become a god if Ser hadn’t willed 
the exchange of roles. 

Was this Ser’s intent all along 
— to allow Mok to evolve as 
devil and then usurp his identity? 

In that case, Ser was actually 
a devil from the beginning, and 
Mok had been right in opposing 
him, for Mok was truly godlike. 

Or were they all — Mok, Ser, 
the others, even the primitive 
mammalian creatures on this 
planet — both gods and devils? 

It was a matter, Mok decided, 
which might require an eternity 
of contemplation. END

Uncle George was a dealer in junk 
— such as diamonds and great art! 



I 

MpKe police picked up Uncle 
George walking west on Elm 
street at 3 o’clock in tHe morn- 
ing. He was shuffling along, mut- 
tering to Himself, and His clotKes 



were soaked, as if He’d been out 
in tfie rain — and Cottonwood 
country for tHe last tfiree months 
Had been suffering a drought, 
witH tHe corn withering in the 
field and day after day not a 
cloud in sight. He was carrying 
85 



a good-sized painting underneath 
one arm and in the other Hand Ee 
carried a pail filled to tHe brim 
witH diamonds. He was in Eis 
stocking feet; Ee’d lost Eis sEoes 
somewhere. When Officer Alvin 
Saunders picked him up, Ee ask- 
ed Uncle George what was going 
on, and George mumbled some- 
thing that Alvin couldn’t quite 
make out. He seemed to be be- 
fuddled. 

So Alvin took him to tEe sta- 
tion, and it wasn’t until then they 
saw that his pockets bulged. So 
they emptied his pockets and laid 
all the stuff out on a table, and 
when they’d had a good look at 
it, Sergeant Steve O’Donnell 
phoned Chief Chet Burnside to 
ask him what to do. The chief, 
sore at being hauled out of bed, 
said to throw George into pokey. 
So that is what they did. You 
couldn’t really blame the chief, of 
course. Off and on, for years, 
Uncle George had given the po- 
lice force of Willow Grove a 
fair amount of trouble. 

But as soon as Uncle George 
Had a chance to look around and 
realize where he was. He grabbed 
up a stool and beat upon the bars, 
yelling that the dirty fuzz Had 
framed him once again and de- 
claring very loudly that his con- 
stitutional rights as a free and 
upright citizen were being tram- 
pled on. “I know my rights,” he 
yelled. “You owe me at least 
86 



one pEone call and when I get out 
of Here I’m going to sue all of 
you on the grounds of false ar- 
rest.” 

So they unlocked tEe cell and 
let him make Eis call. As usual 
he made the call to me. 

“Who is it?” Elsie asked, sitting 
up in bed. 

“It’s your Uncle George,” I 
said. 

“I knew it!” I said. 

. “I knew it!” she exclaimed. 
“Aunt Myrt is off to California 
to visit relatives. And he’s run- 
ning loose again.” 

All right,” I said to George, 
“what could it be this time?” 
“You needn’t take that tone 
of voice, John,” he said. “It’s 
only once or twice a year I call 
you. And what’s the use of hav- 
ing a lawyer in the family . ” 
“You can skip that part of it,” 
I told him, “and get down to 
what is going on.” 

“This time,” he said, trium- 
phantly, “I got them dead to 
rights. This time you get paid 
off. I’ll split the judgment with 
you. I wasn’t doing nothing. I 
was walking down the street 
when the fuzz pulled up and 
hauled me in. I v/asn’t stagger- 
ing and I wasn’t singing. I was 
creating no disturbance. 1 tell 
you, John, a man lias the right 
to walk the streets, no matter at 
what hour ...” 

“I’ll be right down,” I said. 

GALAXY 



“Don’t be too long,” said Elsie, 
“You have a hard day coming 
up in the court.” 

“Are you kidding?” I asked. 
“‘With Uncle George, the day’s 
already lost.” 

TTTlien I got down to the sta- 
’ * tion, they all were waiting 
for me. George was sitting be- 
side a table, and on the table 
stood the pail of diamonds with 
the junk they’d taken from his 
pockets and the painting was 
leaning up against it. The police 
chief had gotten there, just a few 
minutes ahead of me. 

“Okay,” I said, “let’s get down 
to business. What’s the charge?” 
The chief still was pretty sore. 
“We don’t need no charge right 
yet.” 

“I’ll tell you, CHet,” I said, 
“you’ll need one badly before the 
day is over, so you better start 
to thinking.” 

“I’m going to wait,” said Chet, 
“to see wh'at Charley says.” 

He meant Charley Nevins, the 
county attorney. 

“All right, then,” I said, “if there 
is no charge as yet, what are 
the circumstances?” 

“Well,” said the chief, “George 
here was carrying a pail of dia- 
monds. And you tell me just how 
he came by a pail of diamonds.” 
“Maybe they aren’t diamonds,” 
I suggested. “How come you’re 
so sure that they are diamonds?” 
BUCKETS OF DIAMONDS 



“Soon as He opens up, we’ll 
get Harry in to have a look at 
them.” 

Harry was the jeweler, who had 
a shop across the square. 

I went over to the table and 
picked up some of the diamonds. 
They surely looked like dia- 
monds, but I am no jeweler. They 
were cut and faceted and shot 
fire in the light. Some of them 
were bigger than my fist. 

“Even if they should b'e dia- 
monds,” I demanded, “‘what Has 
that to do with it? There’s no law 
I know of says a man can’t carry 
diamonds.” 

“That’s telling them!” cheered 
George. 

“You shut up,” I told Kim, 
“and keep out of this. Let me 
handle it.” 

“But George Here hasn’t got 
no diamonds,” said the chief. 
“These must be stolen diamonds.” 

“Are you charging Kim with 
theft?” I asked. 

“Well, not right now,” said 
the chief. “I ain’t got no evidence 
as yet.” 

“And there’s that painting, 
too,” said Alvin Saunders. “It 
looks to me just like one of them 
old masters.” 

“There’s one thing,” I told 
them, “that puzzles me exceed- 
ingly. Would you tell me where, 
in Willow Grove, anyone bent 
on thievery could find an old 
master or a pail of diamonds?” 

87 



That stopped them, of course. 
There isn’t anyone in Willow 
Grove who has an honest-to-God 
painting except Banker Amos 
Stevens, who brought one back 
from a visit to Chicago; and 
knowing as little as he does about 
the world of art he was probably 
taken, 

“You’ll have to admit, though,” 
said the chief, “there’s something 
funny going on.” 

“Maybe so,” I said, “but I 
doubt that that alone is sufficient 
ground to hold a man in jail.” 
“It ain’t the diamonds or the 
paintings so much as this other 
stuff,” declared the chief, “that 
makes me think there are she- 
nanigans afoot. Look at this, 
will you!” 

TT e picked up a gadget from the 
-*■ table and Held it out to me. 
“Watch out,” he warned. “One 
end of it’s hot, and the ether end 

is cold.” 

It was about a foot in length 
and shaped something like an 
hourglass. The hourglass part of 
it was some sort of transparent 
plastic, pinched in at the mid- 
dle and flaring at both ends, and 
the ends were open. Through the 
center of it ran a rod that looked 
like metal. One end of the metal 
glowed redly, and when I held 
my hand down opposite the open 
end a blast of heat came out. The 
other end was white, covered by 
38 



crystals. I turned it around to 
look. 

“Keep away from it,” warned 
the chief. “That end of it is cold- 
er than a witch’s spit. Them’s big 
ice crystals hanging onto it.” 

I laid it back upon the table, 
carefully. 

“Well,” the chief demanded, 
“what do you make of it?” 

“I don’t know,” I said. 

I never took any more physics 
in school than had been necessary 
and I’d long since forgotten all I’d 
ever known about it. But I knew 
damn well that the gadget on 
the table was impossible. But im- 
possible or not, there it was, one 
end of the rod glowing with its 
Heat, the other frosted by its 
cold. 

“And this,” said the chief, pick- 
ing up a little triangle formed by 
a thin rod of metal or of plastic. 
“What do you think of this?” 

“What should I think of it?” I 
asked. “It’s just ...” 

“Stick your finger through it,” 
said the police chief triumphant- 
ly.” 

I tried to stick my finger 
through it and I couldn’t. There 
was nothing there to stop me. 
My finger didn’t hit anything, 
there was no pressure on it and 
I couldn’t feel a thing, but I 
couldn’t put my finger through 
the center of that triangle. It 
was as if I’d hit a solid wall 
that I couldn’t see or feel. 

GALAXY 



“Let me see that thing,” I said. 

The chief handed it to me, and 
I held it up to the ceiling light 
and I twisted it and turned it, and 
so Help me, there wasn’t anything 
there. I could see right through 
it and' I could see there was noth- 
ing there, but when I tried to 
put my finger through the center, 
there was something there to stop 
it. 

I laid it back on the table be- 
side the hourglass thing. 

“You want to see more?” asked 
the chief. 

I shook my head. “I’ll grant 
you, Chet, that I don’t know what 
this is all about, but I don’t see 
a thing here that justifies you in 
holding George.” 

“I’m holding him,” said the 
chief, “until I can talk to Char- 
ley.” 

“You know, of course, that as 
soon as court opens, I’ll be back 
here with an order for his re- 
lease.” 

“I know that, John,” said the 
chief. “You’re a real good law- 
yer. But I can’t let him go.” 

CCTf that’s tire case,” I said, “I 
want a signed inventory of 
all this stuff you took off of him, 
and then I want you to lock it 
up.” 

“But ...” 

“Theoretically,” I said, “it’s 
George’s property ...” 

“It couldn’t be. You know it 
BUCKETS OF DIAMONDS 



couldn’t, John. Where would Be 
have gotten ...” 

“Until you can prove that Be 
Has stolen it from some specific 
person, I imagine the law would 
say that it was His. A man doesn’t 
have to prove where he obtained 
such’ property.” 

“OH, all right,” said the cEief. 
“I’ll make out the inventory, but 
I don’t know just what we’ll call 
some of this stuff.” 

“And now,” I said, “I’d like to 
Have a moment to confer with my 
client.” 

After balking and stalling 
around a bit, the chief opened up 
the city council chamber for us. 

“Now, George,” I said, “I want 
you to tell me exactly How it 
was. Tell me everything that Hap- 
pened and tell it from the start.” 
George knew I wasn’t fooling, 
and He knew better than to lie 
to me. I always caught him in 
his lies. 

“You know, of course,” said 
George, “that Myrt is gone . .. ” 
“I know that,” I said. 

“And you know that every time 
she’s gone, I go out and get 
drunk and get into some sort 
of trouble. But this time I prom- 
ised myself I wouldn’t do any 
drinking and wouldn’t get into 
any kind of trouble. Myrt’s put 
up with a lot from me, and this 
time I was set to show Her I 
could behave myself. So last 
night I was sitting in the living 

89 



room, with my slices off, in my 
Stocking feet, with the TV turned 
on, watching a ball game. You 
know, John, if them Twins could 
get a shortstop they might stand 
a chance next year. A shortstop 
and a little better pitching and 
some left-handed' batters and . 

“Get on with it,” I said. 

“I was just sitting there,” said 
George, “watching this here ball 
game and drinking beer. I had 
got a six-pack and I guess I was 
on the last bottle of it ... ” 

“I thought you said you Had 
promised yourself you would do 
no drinking.” 

“Afi, John, this was only beer. 
I can drink beer all day and 
never ...” 

“All right, go on,” I said. 

fiflXTell, I was just sitting 
* ’ there, drinking that last 
bottle of beer and the game was 
in the seventh inning and the 
Yanks had two men on and 
Mantle coming up . ” 

“Damn it, not the game!” I 
yelled at him. “Tell me what hap- 
pened to you. You’re the one in 
trouble.” 

“That’s about all there was 
to it,” said George. “It was the 
seventh inning and Mantle com- 
ing up, and the next thing I knew 
I was walking on the street and 
a police car pulling up?” 

“You mean you don’t know 
what happened in between? You 
90 



don’t know where you got the 
pail of diamonds or the painting 
or all the other junk?” 

George shook his head. “I’m 
telling you just the way it was. 
I don’t remember anything. I 
wouldn’t lie to you. It doesn’t 
pay to lie to you. You always 
trip me up.” 

I sat there for a while, looking 
at him, and I knew it was no use 
to ask him any more. He prob- 
ably Had told me the truth, but 
perhaps not all of it, and it would 
take more time than I had right 
then to sweat it out of him. 

“O.K.,” I said:, “we’ll let it go 
at that. You go back and get into 
that cell and don’t let out a 
whimper. Just behave yourself. 
I’ll be down by nine o’clock or 
so and get you out. Don’t talk 
to anyone. Don’t answer any 
questions. Volunteer no informa- 
tion. If anyone asks you anything, 
tell them I’ve told you not to 
talk.” 

“Do I get to keep the dia- 
monds?” 

“I don’t know,” I said. “They 
may not be diamonds.” 

“But you asked for an inven- 
tory.” 

“Sure I did,” I said, “but I 
don’t know if I can make it 
stick.” 

“One thing, John. I got an aw- 
ful thirst ...” 

“No,” I said. 

“Three or four botles of beer. 

GALAXY 



THat couldn’t hurt much. A man 
can’t get drunk on only three or 
four. I wasn’t drunk last night. 
I swear to you I wasn’t.” 

“Where would I get beer at 
this time in the morning?” 

“You always have a few tucked 
away in your refrigerator. And 
that’s only six blocks or so away.” 
“OH, all right,” I said. “I’ll 
ask the chief about it.” 

The chief said yes, he guessed 
it would be all right, so I left to 
get the beer. 

II 

nph’e moon was setting behind 
the courthouse cupola, and in 
the courthouse square the Sol- 
dier’s Monument was alternate- 
ly lighted and darkened by a 
street lamp swaying in a little 
breeze. I had a look at the sky, 
and it seemed entirely clear. 
There were no clouds in sight 
and no chance of rain. The sun, 
in a few hours more, would blaze 
down again and the corn would 
dry a little more and the fanners 
would watch their wells anxious- 
ly as the pumps brought up les- 
sening streams of water for their 
bawling cattle. 

A pack of five or six dogs came 
running across the courthouse 
lawn. There was a dog-leashing 
ordinance, but everyone tamed 
their dogs loose at night and 
hoped they would come home for 
BUCKETS OF DIAMONDS 



breakfast before Virgil Tfiompi- 
son, the city dog catcher, could 
get 'wind of them. 

I got into the car and drove 
home and found four bottles of 
beer in the refrigerator. I took it 
back to the station, then drove 
Home again. 

By this time it was 4:30, and 
I decided it wasn’t worth my 
while to go back to bed, so I 
made some coffee and started to 
fry some eggs. Elsie heard me 
and came down, and I fried some 
eggs for her and we sat and talk- 
ed. 

Her Uncle George had been in 
a lot of scrapes, none of them se- 
rious, and I had always managed 
to get him out of them one way 
or another. He wasn’t a vicious 
character and lie was an Honest 
man, liked by most everyone in 
town. He ran a junkyard out at 
the edge of town, charging peo- 
ple for dumping trash, most of 
which he used to fill in a swampy 
stretch of ground, salvaging some 
of the more usable junk and sell- 
ing it cheap to people who might 
need it. It wasn’t a very elevat- 
ing kind of business, but he made 
an honest living at it and in a 
little town like ours if you made 
an honest living it counts for 
quite a lot. 

But this scrape was just a little 
different, and it bothered me. It 
wasn’t exactly the kind of situa- 
tion that was covered in a law 

91 



book. The thing that bothered 
me the most was where George 
could have gotten the stuff they 
found on him. 

“Do you think we should phone 
Aunt Myrt?” asked Elsie. 

“Not right now,” I told her. 
“Having her here wouldn’t help 
at all. All she’d do would be to 
scream and wring her hands.” 

“What are you going to do first 
of all?” she asked. 

“First of all,” I said, “I’m go- 
ing to find Judge Benson and get 
a writ to spring him out of jail. 
Unless Charley Nivens can find 
some grounds for holding him 
and I don’t think he can. Not 
right away, at least.” 

But I never got the writ. I was 
about to leave my office to go 
over to the courthouse to hunt 
up the judge when Dorothy In- 
gles, my old-maid secretary, told 
me I had a call from Charley. 

T picked up the phone, and he 
didn’t even wait for me to 
say hello. He just started shout- 
ing. 

“All right,” he yelled, “you can 
start explaining. Tell me how 
you did it.” 

“How I did what?” I asked. 

“How George broke out of 
jail.” 

“But he isn’t out of jail. When 
I left he was locked up and I was 
just now going over to the court- 
house ...” 

92 



“He’s not locked up now,” 
yelled Cliarley. “Th’e cell door 
still is locked, but he isn’t there. 
All that’s left is four empty beer 
bottles, standing in a row.” 
“Look, Charley,” I said, “I 
don’t know a thing about this. 
You know me well enough . ” 
“Yeah,” yelled Charley, “I 
know you well enough'. There 
isn’t any dirty trick ...” 

He strangled on his words, and 
it was only justice. Of all the 
tricky lawyers in the state, Char- 
ley is tlie trickiest. 

“If you are thinking,” I said, 
“of swearing out a fugitive war- 
rant for him, you might give a 
thought to the lack of grounds 
for his incarceration.” 

“Grounds!” yelled Charley. 
“There is that pail of diamonds.” 
“If they are really diamonds.” 
“They are diamonds, that’s for 
sure. Harry Johnson had a look 
at them this morning and he says 
that they are diamonds. There is 
just one thing wrong. Harry says 
there are no diamonds in the 
world- as big as those. And very 
few as perfect.” 

He paused for a moment and 
then he whispered, hoarsely, “Tell 
me, John, what is going on. Let 
me in on it.” 

“I don’t know,” I said. 

“But you talked with him and 
he told the chief you had told 
him not to answer any questions.” 
“That’s good legal procedure,” 
GALAXY 



I told him. “You can have no 
quarrel with that. And another 
thing. I’ll hold you responsible 
for seeing that those diamonds 
don’t disappear somehow. I have 
an inventory signed by Chet and 
there is no charge ...” 

“What about busting jail?” 
“Not unless you can show cause 
for his being arrested in the first 
place.” 

He slammed down the receiver, 
and I hung up the plione and sat 
there trying to get the facts 
straight inside my mind. But they 
were too fantastic for me to make 
them spell out any sense. 

“Dorothy,” I yelled. 

She poked her head around t He 
door, her face prissy with her dis- 
approval. Somehow, apparently, 
she had heard about what had 
been going on — as, no doubt, 
had everyone in town — ■ and she 
was one of the few who Held 
George in very ill -repute. She 
thought lie was a slob. She re- 
sented my relationship to him 
and she often pointed out that he 
cost me over the years, a lot of 
time and cash, with, no money 
ever coming back. Which was 
true, of course, but you can’t ex- 
pect a junkyard operator to af- 
ford fancy legal fees and, in any 
case, he was Elsie’s uncle. 

“Put in a call to Calvin Ross,” 
I told her, “at the Institute of 
Arts in Minneapolis. He is an 
old friend of mine and ...” 



Tp anker Amos Stevens came 
JL> b urs ting through the door. 
He crossed the outer office and 
brushed past Dorothy as if she 
weren’t there. 

“John, do you know wfiat you 
Have got — what you’ve got down 
there!” 

“No,” I said. “Please tell me.” 
“You have got a Rembrandt!” 
“Oh, you mean the painting.” 
“Where do you think George 
found a Rembrandt? There aren’t 
any Rembrandts except in muse- 
ums and such.” 

“We’ll soon find out more 
about it,” I told Banker Stevens 
Willow Grove’s one and only ex- 
pert in the arts. “I’ve got a call 
in now and ...” 

Dorothy stuck her head around 
the door. “Mr. Ross is on the 
phone,” she said. 

I picked up the phone and I 
felt a little funny about it, be- 
cause Cal Ross and I hadn’t seen 
each other for a good fifteen 
years or more, and 1 wasn’t even 
sure he would remember me. 
But I told him who 1 was and 
acted as if we’d had lunch to- 
gether just the day before, and 
he did the same to me. 

Then I got down to business. 
“Cal, we have a painting out 
here that maybe you should have 
a look at. Some people think it 
might be old and 1 perhaps by ©ne 
of the old masters. I know that it 
sounds crazy, but ...” 



BUCKETS OF DIAMONDS 



93 



“Where did you say tliis paint- 
ing is?” lie asked. 

“Here in Willow Grove.” 

“Have you Had a look at it?” 
“Well, yes,” I said, “a glance, 
but I wouldn’t know ...” 

“Tell Him,” Stevens wfiispered, 
fiercely, “tfiat is it a Rembrandt,” 
“Who owns it?” 

“Not really anyone,” I said, 
“It’s down at the city jail.” 
“John, are you trying to suck 
me into something? As an ex- 
pert witness, maybe.” 

“Nothing like that,” I said, 
“but it does Have a bearing on a 
case of mine and I suppose I 
could dig up a fee . ” 

“Tell Him,” Stevens insisted, 
“that it is a Rembrandt.” 

“Did I Hear someone talking 
about a Rembrandt?” Cal asked. 

“No,” I said. “No one knows 
what it is.” 

“Maybe I could get away,” He 
said. 

He was getting interested 
well, maybe interested isn’t the 
words; intrigued might be more 
like it. 

“I could arrange a charter 
to fly you out,” I said. 

“It’s that important, is it?” 
“To tell you the truth, Cal, I 
don’t know if it is or not. I’d just 
like your opinion.” 

“‘Fix up the charter, then,” He 
said, “and call me back. I can 
be at the airport to be picked 
up within an Hour.” 

94 



“Thanks, Cal,” I said “I’ll be 
seeing you.” 

|I7 hie would be sore at me, I 
knew, and Dorothy would be 
furious. Chartering a plane, for 
a small-town lawyer in a place 
like Willow Grove, is downright 
extravagance. But if we could 
Hang onto those diamonds, or 
even a part of them, the bill for 
the charter would be peanuts. If 
they were diamonds. I wasn’t ab- 
solutely sure Harry Johnson 
would know a diamond if he saw 
one. He sold them in His store, 
of course, but I suspected that He 
just took some wholesaler’s word 
that what He had were diamonds. 

“Who was that you were talk- 
ing to?” demanded Banker Stev- 
ens. 

I told him who it was. 

“Then why didn’t you tell Him 
it was a Rembrandt?” Stevens 
raged at me. “Don’t you think 
that I would know a Rembrandt?” 
I almost told him no, that I 
didn’t think He would, and then 
thought better of it. Some day I 
might Have to ask Him for a loan. 

“Look, Amos,” I said, “I didn’t 
want to do anything that would 
prejudice his judgment. Nothing 
that would sway him one way or 
the other. Once He gets Here He 
will no doubt see right away tliat 
it is a Rembrandt.” 

That mollified him a bit, and 
then I called in Dorothy and 

GALAXY 



asked Kef to fix up arrangements 
for Cal to be flown out, and Her 
moutH got grimmer and Her face 
more prissy at every word I said. 
If Amos hadn’t been there, sKe’d 
Eave Had something to say about 
throwing away my money. 

Looking at her, I could under- 
stand the vast enjoyment she got 
out of the revival meetings that 
blossomed out in Willow Grove 
and other nearby towns each 
summer. She went to all of them, 
no matter what the sect, and sat 
on the hard benches in the sum- 
mer heat and dropped in her 
quarter when the collection plate 
was passed and sucked out of the 
fire-and-brimstone preaching a 
vast amount of comfort. She was 
always urging me to go to them, 
but I never went. I always had 
the feeling she thought they might 
do me a world of good. 

“You’re going to be late in 
court,” she told me curtly, “and 
the case this morning is one 
you’ve spent a lot of time on.” 

Which was Her way of telling 
me I shouldn’t be wasting any of 
my time on George. 

So I went off to court. 

At noon recess, I phoned the 
jail, and Ehere’d been no sign of 
George. At three o’clock, Doro- 
thy came across the square to 
tell me Calvin Ross would be 
coming in at five. I asked her to 
phone Elsie to be expecting a 
guest for dinner and maybe one 
BUCKETS OF DIAMONDS 



for overnight; and she didn’t say 
anything, but from Her face I 
knew she thought I was a brute 
and she’d not blame Elsie any if 
she up and left me. Such haeon- 
sideration! 

At five o’clock I picked Cal up 
at our little airport and a fair 
crowd was on hand. Somehow the 
word had got around that an art 
expert was flying out to Have a 
look at the painting George Wet- 
more Had picked up somewhere. 

Cal was somewhat older than 
I had remembered him and age 
Had served to emphasize and 
sharpen up the dignity that he’d 
Had even in his youth. But he 
was kind and affable and as en- 
thusiastic about his art as he had 
ever been. And I realized, with a 
start that he was excited. The 
possibility of finding a long-lost 
painting of some significance 
must be, I realized, a dream that 
is dear to everyone in the field. 

I drove him down to the square 
and we went into the station and 
I introduced him round. Chet 
told me there was no sign of 
George. After a little argument, 
he got out the painting and laid 
it on the table underneath the 
ceiling light. 

Cal walked over to look down 
at it and suddenly he froze, like 
a bird dog on the point. For a 
long time he stood there, not 
moving, looking down at it, while 
the rest of us stood around and 

95 



tried not to breathe too Kard. 

Then he took a folding magni- 
fier out of His pocket and un- 
folded it. He bent above tKe 
painting and moved tKe glass 
from spot to spot, staring at eacB 
spot over wHicH lie Held tKe glass 
for long seconds. 

Finally Ke straigKtened up. 

“John,” Ke said, “would you 
please tilt it up for me.” 

I tilted it up on tKe table and 
Ke walked back a ways and Had 
a long look at it from several an- 
gles and then came back and 
examined it witK tKe glass again. 

Finally he straigKtened up 
again and nodded to CKet. 

“TKanks very much,” Ke said. 
“If I were you, I’d guard that 
canvas very carefully.” 

Chet was dying to know wfiat 
Cal might think, but I didn’t 
give him a chance to ask. I 
doubt Cal would Have told him 
anything even if He’d asked. 

I Hustled Cal out of there and 
got him in the car and we sat 
tKere for a moment without ei- 
ther of them saying anything at 
all. 

Then Cal said, “Unless my cri- 
tical faculties and my knowledge 
of art have deserted me entirely, 
that canvas in there is Toulouse- 
Lautrec’s Quadrille at the Mou- 
lin Rouge.” 

So it wasn’t Rembrandt! I’d 
known damn well it wasn’t. So 
much for Amos Stevens! 

96 



“I’d stake my life on it,” said 
Cal. “I can’t be mistaken. No one 
could copy the canvas as faith- 
fully as that. There is only one 
thing wrong.”” 

“Wh'at is that?” I asked. 
“Quadrille at the Moulin 
Rouge is in Washington, at the 
National Gallery of Art.” 

T experienced a sinking feeling in 
my gizzard. If George some- 
how Had managed to rifle the 
National Gallery both of us were 
sunk. 

“It’s possible the painting is 
missing,” said Cal, “and the Na- 
tional Gallery people are keeping 
quiet about it for a day or two. 
Although ordinarily, they’d no- 
tify other large museums and 
some of the dealers.” 

He shook his head, perplexed. 
“But why anyone should steal it 
is more than I would know. 
There’s always the possibility 
that it could be sold to some col- 
lector who would keep it hidden. 
But that would require prior ne- 
gotiations, and few collectors 
would be so insane as to buy a 
painting as famous as the Moulin 
Rouge.” 

I took some hope from that. 
“Then there isn’t any possibility 
George could have stolen it.” 
He looked at me, funny. “From 
what you tell me,” he said, “this 
George of yours wouldn’t know 
one painting from another.” 

GALAXY 



“I don’t think he would.” 

“Well, that lets him out. He 
tnust have just picked it up some- 
where. But where — that’s the 
question.” 

I couldn’t help him there. 

“I think,” said Cal, “I had bet- 
ter make a phone call.” 

We drove down to the office 
and climbed the stairs. 

Dorothy was waiting for me to 
come back, and she still was sore 
at me. “There is a Colonel Shel- 
don Reynolds in your office,” she 
told me. “He is from the Air 
Force.” 

“I can phone out here,” said 
Cal. 

“Colonel Reynolds Has been 
waiting for some time,” said Dor- 
othy, “and it strikes me as a most 
patient man.” 

I could see she didn’t approve 
of me associating with people 
from the world of art and that 
she highly disapproved of me 
meeting with the Air Force and 
she still was sore at me for giving 
Elsie such a short notice we were 
to have a dinner guest. She was 
very properly outraged, although 
she was too much of a lady and 
too loyal an employee to bawl me 
out in front of Cal. 

T went into my office, and sure 
-®- enough, Colonel Reynolds 
was there, acting most impatient, 
sitting on the edge of a chair and 
drumming his fingers on its arms. 

BUCKETS OF DIAMONDS 



He quit his drumming and 
stood up as soon as I came in. 
“Mr. Page,” he said. 

“‘I’m sorry you had to wait,” 
I said. “What can I do for you?” 
We shook hands, and he sat 
down in the chair and I perched 
uneasily on the edge of the desk 
waiting. 

“It has come to my attention,” 
he told me, “that there have beea 
some extraordinary occurrences 
in town and that there are 
tain artifacts involved. I’ve spc.fe- 
en with the county attorney, and 
he says you are the man I have 
to talk with. It appears there h 
some question about the owner- 
ship of the artifacts.” 

“If you’re talking about what 3 
think you are,” I told him, “these 
is no question whatsoever. All the 
articles in question are the prop- 
erty of my client.” 

“I understand your client Hast 
escaped from jail.” 

“Disappeared,” I said. “And fie 
was placed in custody originally; 
in an illegal manner. The m0k 
was doing nothing except wag- 
ing on the street.” 

“Mr. Page,” said the colonel, 
“you do not have to convince *o©«

of the case. All the Air Fore® M 
concerned’ about are certain gad-

probably crucify Him in court if 
He let me see them. But He said 
you were a reasonable man and if

“Colonel,” I said, “I’m never a 
reasonable man wEere tKe welfare 
of my client could be jeopar- 
dized.” 

“You don’t know wliere your 
client is?” 

“I Have no idea.” 

“He must Have told you wEere 
He found the stuff.” 

“I don’t think He knows Him- 
self,” I said. 

TKe colonel, I could see, didn’t 
believe a word I told Kim, for 
wKicK I couldn’t very well blame 
Him. 

“Didn’t your client tell you 
He’d contacted a UFO?” 

I shook my Head, bewildered. 
That was a new one on me. I’d 
never tKougHt of it. 

“Mr. Page,” tKe colonel said, 
“I don’t mind telling you tKat 
these gadgets might mean a lot 
to us. Not to tHe Air Force alone, 
but to the entire nation. If the 
other side sEould get Hold of 
some of them before we did

“Now wait a minute,” I inter- 
rupted. “Are you trying to tell 
me there are sucH things as

He stiffened. “I’m not trying to 
tell you anything at all,” He said. 
“I am simply asking ...”

r F'he door opened, and Cal stuck 
in Kis Head. “Sorry for break- 
ing in like this,” He said, “but I 
Have to leave.” 

“You can’t do that,” I pro- 
tested. “Elsie is expecting you for 
dinner. 

“I have to go to Washington,” 
he said. “Your secretary says she 
will run me to the, airport. If tHe 
pilot can get me home within an 
Eour or so, I can catcH a plane.” 

“You talked with the National 
Gallery?” 

“The painting still is there,” 
he said. “There is a remote possi- 
bility there may have been a sub- 
stitution, but with the tight se- 
curity tEat seems impossible. I 
don’t suppose there would be any 
cHance ...” 

“Not a gKost,” I said. “TKe 
painting stays right here.” 

“But it belongs in Washing- 
ton!” 

“Not if there are two of tKem,” 
I sEouted. 

“But there can’t be.” 

“TEere appear to be,” I told 
Him “I’d feel a whole lot better, 
John, if it were in a safer place.” 

“The police are guarding it.” 

“A bank vault would be a 
whole lot better.” 

“I’ll look into it,” I promised. 
“WHat did the National Gallery 
say about it?” 

“Not mucH of anything,” said 
Cal. They are flabbergasted.” 
You may have them out Here.”

“I might as well,” I said. “I 
have the Pentagon.” ” 

We shook hands, and he left 
and, I went back and perched 
upon the desk. 

“You’re a hard man to deal 
with,” said the colonel. “How do 
I reach you? Patriotism, per- 
haps?” 

“I’m not a patriotic man,” I 
told him, “and I’ll instruct my 
client not to be.” 

“Money?” 

“If there were a lot of it.” 

“The public interest?” 

“You’ve got to show me it’s in 
the public interest.” 

We glared at one another. I 
didn’t like this Colonel Sheldon 
Reynolds, and He reciprocated. 
The phone banged' at me. 

It was Chet down at the police 
station. His words started tum- 
bling over one another as soon as 
I picked up the phone. 

“George is back!” he shouted. 
“This time He lias got someone 
with him and he’s driving some- 
thing that looks like a car, but it 
Hasn’t got no wheels ...” 

I slammed down the phone and 
ran for the door. Out of the tail 
of my eye I saw that Reynolds 
had jumped up and was running 
after me. 

Chet had been right. It looked 
like a car, but it had no wheels. 
It was standing in front of the po- 
lice station, Hanging there about 
two feet off the ground and a gen-

tie thrumming indicated there 
was some mechanism somewhere 
inside of it that was running 
smoothly. 

Quite a crowd had gathered 
and I forced my way through it 
and got up beside the car. 

G eorge was sitting in wfiat ap- 
peared to be the driver’s 
seat and sitting beside him was 
a scarecrow of a fellow with the 
soasrest face I’ve ever seen on any 
mm.. 

Hje wore a black robe that 
buttoned, up the front and up 
close around his throat and a 
black skull cap that came down 
hard against his ears and, I’m 
across his forehead; his hands 
and face, all of him that showed, 
were fishbelly white. 

“What happened to you?” I 
demanded of George. “What are 
you sitting here for?” 

“I tell you, John,” lie said, “I 
&m somewhat apprehensive that 
Cbfet will try to throw me into 
the pokey once again. If lie makes 
a. move, I’m all ready to go 
shooting out of here. This here 
vehicle is the slickest thing there 
is. 

“It’ll go along the ground or it 
shoot up in the air and make 
just like a plane. I ain’t rightly 
got the hang of it as yet, having 
hardly driven it, but it handles 
smooth and easy and it ain’t no 
tetefc at all to drive it.”

“You can tell him,” said Char- 
ley Nevins, “that He need not fear 
arrest. There is something most 
peculiar going on here, but I’m 
not sure at all there is violation 
of the law involved.” 

I looked around in some sur- 
prise. I Hadn’t noticed Charley 
standing there when I’d pushed 
through the crowd. 

Reynolds shoved in ahead of 
me and reached up to grab 
George by the arm. 

“I am Colonel Reynolds,” He 
said, and I am from the Air 
Force and it’s terribly important 
that I know what this is all 
about.” 

“Why,” Ke said, “it was stand- 
ing there with’ a pile of other 
junk, so I took it. Someone threw 
it away and didn’t seem to want 
it. There were a lot of people 
there throwing things away that 
they didn’t want.” 

“And I suppose,” yelled Chet,, 
“that someone threw away the 
painting and the pail of dia- 
monds.” 

“I wouldn’t know about that,” 
George told him. “I don’t seem to 
remember much about that other 
trip. Except there was this big 
pile of stuff and that it was rain- 
ing .. ” 

“Shut up, George,” I said. He 
hadn’t told me anything about 
a pile of stuff. Either his memory 
was improving or he had lied to 
me.

“I think,” said Charley, getting 
edgy, “that we all better sit down 
together and see if we can make 
some sense out of these proceed- 
ings.” 

“That’s all right with me,” I 
said, “always remembering that 
this machine remains, technically 
the property of my client.” 

“It seems to me,” Charley said 
to me, “that you’re being some- 
what unreasonable and High- 
handed in this whole affair.” 

“Charley,” I said, “you know I 
have to be. If I let down my 
guard a minute, you and Chet 
and the Pentagon will tramp all 
over me.” 

“Let’s get on with it,” said 
Charley. “George, you put that 
machine down on the ground and 
come along with us. Chet will 
stand guard over it and see no one 
touches it.” 

“And while you’re doing that,” 
I said, “don’t take your eyes off 
the painting and the diamonds. 
The painting just might be worth 
an awful lot of money.” 

“Right now,” said Chet, dis- 
gusted, “would be a swell time 
for someone to rob the bank. I’d 
have the entire force tied up 
watching all this junk of 
George’s.” 

“I think, too,” said Charley, 
“we better include this passenger 
of George’s in our little talk. He 
might be able to add some en- 
lightenment.” 

BUCKETS OF DIAMONDS 



G eorge’s passenger didn’t pay| 
any attention. He’d beep 
paying no attention all along. He 
had just been sitting there, bolt 
upright in his seat, with his face 
pointing straight ahead. 

Chet walked officiously around 
the car. He said something, at 
some length, in a high, chittering 
voice. I didn’t recognize a word 
of it but crazy as it sounds* I 
knew exactly what He said. 

“Don’t touch me!” He said. 
“Get away from me. Don’t inter- 
fere with me.” 

And, Having said this, he open- 
ed the door and let Himself to the 
ground. Cliet stepped back from 
him and so did all the others. Si- 
lence fell uponi the gathering 
which Had been buzzing up until 
this moment. As he advanced 
down the street, the crowd partert 
and pressed back to make way for 
Him. CEarley and tEe colonel 
stepped backward, bumping into 
me, pinning me against tKe car, 
to get out of His way. He passed 
not more tEan ten feet from me 
and I got a good look at His face. 
There was no expression on it 
and it was set in a natural grim- 
ness — the way, I imagined, that 
a judge of the Inquisition might 
Have looked. And there was some- 
thing else that is very Hard to 
say, an impression that translated 
itself into a sense of smell, al- 

101 



through I am sure there was no 
actual odor. The odor of sanctity 
is as close as I can come to it, 
I guess. Some sort of vibration ra- 
diating from the man that im- 
pinged upon the senses in the 
same manner, perhaps, as ultra- 
sonics will impinge without actual 
hearing upon the senses of a dog. 

And then he was past me and 
gone, walking down the street 
through the lane of human bodies 
that stepped aside for him walk- 
ing slowly, unconcernedly, almost 
strolling — walking as if he might 
have been, all alone, apparently 
unaware of a single one of us. 

All of us watched him until He 
was free of the crowd and had 
turned a comer into another 
Street. And even for a moment 
after that we stood uncertain and 
unmoving until finally someone 
spoke a whisper and someone an- 
swered him and the buzz of the 
crowd took up again, although 
now a quieter buzz. 

Someone’s fingers were digging 
hard, into the muscles of my up- 
per arm and when I looked 
around. I saw that it was Charley 
who had fastened onto me. 

Ahead of me, the colonel turn- 
ed his head to look at me. His 
face was white and tight and lit- 
tle drops of perspiration stood 
out along his hairline. 

“John,” said Charley, quietly, 
“1 think it is important that we 
all sit down together.” 

102 



I turned around toward the 
car and saw that it was now rest- 
ing on the ground and that George 
was getting out of it. 

“Come along,” I said to 
George. 

/"''diarley led, pushing his way 
Vj through the crowd, with the 
colonel following and George and 
me bringing up the rear. We went 
down the street, without a word 
among us, to the square and 
walked across the lawn to the 
courthouse steps. 

When we got in Charley’s of- 
fice, Charley shut the door and 
dug down into a desk drawer arid 
come up with a jug. He got out 
four paper cups and poured them 
almost full. 

“No ice,” lie said, “but what 
the hell, it’s the liquor that we 
need.” 

Each of us took a cup and 
found a place to sit and worked 
on the booze a while without say- 
ing anything. 

“Colonel,” Charley finally ask- 
ed, “what do you make of it?” 

“It might be a help,” the col- 
onel said, “if we could talk with 
the passenger. I assume some at- 
tempt will be made to apprehend 
the man.” 

“I suppose we should,” said 
Charley. “Although how one ap- 
prehends a bird like that, I don’t 
really know.” 

“He caught us by surprise,” 
GALAXY 



tKe colonel pointed out. “Next 
time we'll be ready for Him. Plug 
your ears with cotton, so you can- 
not Hear Him . * » ” 

“It may take more than that,” 
said CKarley. “Did anyone actu- 
ally Hear Him speak?” 

“He spoke, all riglit,” I said. 
“He uttered words, but there was 
none I recognized. Just a sort of 
chirping gibberish.” 

“But we knew what He meant,” 
said Charley. “Every single one 
of us knew that. Telepathy, per- 
haps?” 

“I doubt it,” the colonel said. 
“Telepathy is not the simple thing 
so many people think.” 

“A new language,” I suggested. 
“A language scientifically con- 
structed. Sounds that are design- 
ed to trigger certain understand- 
ings. If one dug deep enough into 
semantics ...” 

Charley interrupted me; appar- 
ently he took no stock in my se- 
mantics talk. 

“George,” He asked, “wliat do 
you know of him?” 

George was sunk back deep in- 
to a chair, with his shoeless feet 
stuck out in front of Him. He Had 
his big mitt wrapped around the 
paper cup and was wriggling His 
toes and He was content. It did 
not take an awful lot to make 
George content. 

“I don’t know a tiling, ” said 
George. 

“But Ee was riding with you. 
BUCKETS OF DIAMONDS 



He must Have told you some- 
thing.” 

“He never told me a thing,” 
said George. “He never said a 
word. I was just driving off and 
He came running up and jumped 
into the seat and then ...” 

“You were driving off from 
where?” 

“Well,” said George, “there was 
this big pile of stuff. It must have 
covered several acres and it was 
piled up High. It seemed to foe in 
a sort of square, like tKe court- 
house and no lawn, but just a sort 
of paving that might Have been 
concrete and all around it, every- 
where you looked, but quite a dis- 
tance off, there were big high 
buildings.” 

Charley asked, exasperated, 
“Did you recognize the place?” 

“I never saw the place before,” 
said George, “nor no pictures of 
it, even.” 

“Perhaps it would be best,” 
suggested Charley, “if you told 
it from the start.” 

S o George told it the way he 
Had told it to me. 

“That first time it was raining 
pretty hard,” he said, “and it was 
sort of dark, as if evening might 
foe coming on, and all I saw was 
this pile of junk. I didn’t see no 
buildings.” 

He Hadn’t told me he’s seen 
anything at all. He had claimed 
He Hadn’t known a thing until 

103 



Ke was back in Willow Grove, 
walking on the street, with the 
police car pulling up. But I let 
it go and kept on listening. 

“Then,” said George, “after 
CEet threw me into pokey ...” 
“No v/, wait a minute th'ere,” 
said Charley. “I think you skip- 
ped a bit. Where did you get the 
diamonds and the painting and 
all the other stuff?” 

“Why off the pile of junk,” 
said George. There was a lot of 
other stuff and if I’d had the 
time I might have done some bet- 
ter. But something seemed to 
warn me that I didn’t have much 
time and it was raining and the 
rain was cold and the place was 
sort of spooky. So I grabbed 
what I could and put it in my 
pockets and I took the pail of 
diamonds, although I wasn’t 
sure they were really diamonds, 
and then I took the painting 
because Myrt has been yelling 
that she wants a high class picture 
to hang in the dining room ...” 
“And then you were back home 
again?” 

“That is it,” said George, “and 
I am walking down the street, 
minding my own business and 
not doing anything illegal ...” 
“And how about the second 
time?” 

“You mean going back again?” 
“That’s what I mean,” said 
Charley. 

“That first time,” said George, 

104 



“it was unintentional I was just 
sitting in the living room with 
my shoes off and a can of beer, 
watching television and in the 
seventh inning the Yankees had 
two on and Mantle coming up to 
bat — say I never did find out 
what Mantle did. Did he hit a 
homer?” 

“He struck out,” said Charley. 

George nodded sadly; Mickey 
is his hero. 

“The second time,” said George, 
“I sort of worked at it. I don’t 
mind a cell so much’, you under- 
stand, as the injustice of being 
there when you ain’t done noth- 
ing wrong. So I talked John into 
bringing me some beer and I sat 
down and started drinking it. 
There wasn’t any television, but 
I imagined television. I imagined 
it real hard and I put two men an 
bases and had Mantle coming up 
— all in my mind, of course — 
and I guess it must have worked. 
I was back again, in the place 
where there was this pile of junk. 
Only you must understand it 
wasn’t really junk. It was all good 
stuff. Some of it didn’t make any 
sense at all, but a good part of 
it did; and it was just setting 
there and no one touching it and 
every now and then someone 
would come walking out from 
some of those tall buildings — 
and it was quite a walk, I tell 
you, for those buildings were a 
long ways off — and they’d be

carrying something and they’d 
throw it on the pile of junk and 
go walking back.” 

6 6 7 take it,” said tHe colonel, 
-* “that you spent more time 
there on your second trip. 

“It was daytime,” George ex- 
plained, “and it wasn’t raining 
and it didn’t seem so spooky, al- 
though it did seem lonesome. 
There weren’t any people — just 
the few who came walking to 
throw something on the pile, and 
and they didn’t pay much atten- 
tion to me; they acted almost as 
if they didn’t see me. You under- 
stand, I didn’t know if I’d ever 
get back there again and there 
was a limit to how much I could 
carry, so this time I figured 
I’d do a job of it. I’d look over 
pile and figure exactly what I 
wanted. Maybe I should say that 
a little differently. There was a 
lot of it I wanted, but I Had to de- 
cide what I wanted most. So I 
started walking around the pile, 
picking up stuff I thought I 
wanted until I saw something I 
took a special liking to then I’d 
decide between it and something 
else I had picked up. Sometimes 
I’d discard the new thing I had 
picked up and sometimes I’d 
keep it and drop something else. 
Because, you see, I could carry 
just so much, and by this time I 
was loaded with about all that 
I could carry. There was a lot 



of nice items up on the sides of 
the pile, and once I tried climbing 
the pile to get a funny-looking 
sort of gadget, but that stuff was 
piled loose, just tossed up there, 
you know; and when I started to 
climb, the stuff started to shift 
and I was afraid it might all come 
down on top of me. So I climbed 
down again, real careful. After 
that I Had to satisfy myself with 
whatever I could pick up at the 
bottom of the pile.” 

The colonel Had become great- 
ly interested, leaning forward in 
his chair so he wouldn’t miss a 
word. “Some of this junk?” lie 
asked. “Could you tell what it 
was?” 

“There was a pair of specta- 
cles, said George, “with some sort 
of gadget on them and I tried 
them on and I got so happy that 
it scared me, so I took them off 
and I quit being happy; then I 
put them on again and I was hap- 
py right away ...” 

“Happy?” asked Charley. ‘*Do 
you mean they made you drunk?” 

CtXTot drunk Happy,” said 
’ George. “Just plain Hap- 
py, that is all. No troubles and 
no worries and the world looked 
good and a man enjoyed living. 
Then there was another thing, a 
big square piece of glass, I sup- 
pose you’d call it a cube of glass. 
Like these fortune tellers have, 
but it was square instead of

round. It was a pretty thing, all 
by itself, but when you looked- 
into it — well, it didn’t reflect 
your face, like a mirror does, but 
there seemed to be some sort of 
picture in it, deep inside of it. 
It looked to me, that first time, 
like maybe it was a tree and when 
I looked closer I could see it was 
a tree. A big high elm tree like 
the one that used to stand in my 
grandfather’s yard, the one that 
Kad the bobolink’s nest way up at 
the top, and this one, too, I saw, 
had a bobolink’s nest and there 
was the bobolink, himself, sitting 
on a limb beside the nest. And 
then I saw it was the very tree 
that I remembered, for there was 
my grandfather’s house and the 
picket fence and the old man 
sitting in the battered lawn swing, 
smoking his corncob pipe. You 
see, that piece of glass showed 
you anything that you wanted to 
see. First there was just the tree, 
then I thought about the nest 
and the nest was there and then 
the house showed up and the pick- 
et fence and I was all right until 
I saw the old man Himself — 
and him dead for twenty years or 
more. I looked at him for a while 
and then I made myself look 
away, because I had thought a lot 
of the old man and seeing him 
there made me remember too 
much, so I looked away. By then 
I thought I knew what this glass 
was all about and so I thought

of a pumpkin pie and the pie was 
there, with gobs of whipped 
cream piled on it and then I 
thought of a stein of beer and 
the beer was there ..." 

“I don’t believe,” said Charley, 
a single word of this.” 

“Go on,” urged the colonel. 
“Tell us the rest of it.” 

“Well,” said George, “I guess 
I must Have walked almost all the 
way around that pile, picking 
one thing up and throwing anoth- 
er away and I was loaded, I can 
tell you. I had my arms full and 
my pockets full and stuff Hung 
around my neck. And suddenly, 
driving out from those tall build- 
ings came this car, floating about 
three feet off the ground ...” 
“You mean the vehicle that 
you have out there?” 

“The very one,” said George. 
“There was a sad-looking old 
geezer driving it, and He ran it 
up alongside the pile and set it 
down, th'en got out of it and start- 
ed walking back, sort of hobbling. 
So I went up to it and I dumped 
all the stuff I had been carrying 
into the back seat and it occurred 
to me that with it I could carry 
away more than I could in my 
arms. But I thought that first, 
perhaps, I Had ought to see if I 
could operate it, so I climbed iti 
the driver’s seat and there was 
no trick to it at all. I started it 
up and began to drive it, slow, 
around the pile, trying to remem- 



ber where I had discarded some 
of the stuff I had picked up ear- 
lier — intending to go back an'd 
get it and put it in the back seat. 
I heard the sound of running feet 
behind me and when I looked 
around there was this gent all 
dressed in black. He reached the 
car and put one Hand upon it and 
vaulted into the seat beside me. 
The next instant we were in Wil- 
low Grove.” 

<C"V7 r ou mean to tell us,” cried 
the colonel, leaping to 
his feet, that you have the back 
seat of that car loaded with some 
of these things you have been 
telling us about?” 

“Colonel, please sit down,” 
said Charley. “You can’t possibly 
believe any of the things he has 
been telling us. On the face of 
them, they are all impossible 
and ...” 

“Charley,” I said, “let me cite 
a few more impossibilities, like 
a painting being in the National 
Gallery of Arts and also in Wil- 
low Grove, like that car out there 
without any wheels, like a gadget 
that is Hot at one end and cold 
at the other.” 

“God, I don’t know,” said Char- 
ley, desperately. “And I am the 
guy that has it in His lap.” 

“Charley,” I said, “I don’t be- 
lieve you Have anything in your 
lap, at all. I don’t think there is 
a single legal question involved 
108 



in this whole mess. Taking a car, 
you might say, being of the par- 
ticular turn of legal mind you 
are, without the permission of 
the owner, only it is not a car . .” 
“It’s a vehicle!” Charley yelled. 
“But the owner Had junked it. 
He’d junked it and walked away 
and ...” 

“What I want to know,” the 
colonel said, “is where this place 
is and why the people were dis- 
carding their possessions.” 

“And you’d also,” I said, “love 
to get your hands on some of 
those possessions.” 

“You’re damned right I would,” 
said the colonel, grimly. “And I’m 
going to. Do you realize what 
some of them might mean to this 
nation of ours? Why, they might 
spell the margin of difference 
between us and the other side, 
and I don’t intend ...” 

“Colonel,” I said, “haul down 
the flag. There is no use of 
screaming. I am sure that George 
would be willing to discuss terms 
with you.” 

Feet came pounding up the 
stairs and down the hall. The 
door flew open and a deputy 
sheriff came skidding to a halt. 

“Charley,” he panted, “I don’t 
know what to do. There’s been 
a crazy-looking coot preaching to 
a crowd out by the Soldier’s mon- 
ument. The sheriff, I am told, 
went out to stop it, him not hav- 
ing any license to be preaching

anywhere, let alone the court- 
house square, and then came 
charging back. I came in the back 
way, without knowing anything 
about what was going on, and I 
found the sheriff collecting up tlie 
guns and ammunition and when 
I asked him what was going on, 
he wouldn’t talk to me, but went 
-stalking out the front door and 
he threw all of them guns and 
all that ammunition down at the 
base of the monument. And there 
are a lot of other people bring- 
ing other things and throwing 
them there, too ...” 

V 

T didn’t wait to Hear the rest of 
-*• it. I dodged past the deputy 
and through the door and down 
the stairs, heading for the build- 
ing’s front. 

The pile had grown to a size 
that was big enough to cover the 
base of the monument; and there 
were, I saw, such things as bi- 
cycles, radios, typewriters and 
sewing machines, electric razors 
and lawn mowers; and there was 
a car or two, jammed up against 
the monument. Dusk had fallen, 
and the farmers were coming into 
town to trade and people were 
coming across the square, dark 
muffled figures, lugging stuff to 
throw upon the pile. 

There was no sign of the pas- 
senger. He Had done his dirty 
BUCKETS OF DIAMONDS 



work and gone. Standing there 
in the courthouse square, with 
the street lamps swinging in the 
tiny breeze and all those dark- 
enshrouded figures toiling up the 
lawii toward the monument, I 
Had the vision of many other 
towns throughout the country 
with growing piles of discarded 
objects bearing testimony to the 
gullibility of the liuman race. 

My God, I thought, they never 
understood a word of what he 
said, not a single syllable of that 
clacking tongue of his. But the 
message as had been the case 
when we’d pushed back to clear 
the path for him, had been plain 
and clear. Thinking about it, I 
knew I’d been right up there in 
Charley’s office when I’d said it 
was a matter of semantics 

We Had words, of course, lots 
of words, perhaps more than an 
ordinary man would ever need, 
but intellectual words, tailored 
for their precise statement of one 
peculiar piece of understanding; 
and we’d become so accustomed 
to them, to their endless ebb and 
flow, that many of them — per- 
haps the most of them — had lost 
the depth and the precision of 
their meaning. There Had been a 
time when great orators could 
catch and hold the public ear 
with the pure poetry of their 
speech and men such’ as these 
had at times turned the tide of 
national opinion. Now, However, 

109 



in large part, spoken words had 
lost tEeir power to move. But the 
laugh, I thought would never lose 
its meaning. The merry laugh that, 
even if one were not included in 
it, could lift the Human spirits; 
the belly laugh that spelled out 
unthinking fellowship; the quiet 
laugh of superior, supercilious in- 
tellect that could cut the ground 
beneath one. 

Sounds, I thought — sounds, 
not words — sounds that could 
trigger basic human reaction. Was 
it something such as this that 
the passenger had used? Sounds 
so laboriously put together, prob- 
ing so deeply into the Human 
psyche, that they said almost as 
much as the most carefully con- 
structed sentence of intellectual 
speech', but with the one advan- 
tage that they were convincing as 
words could never be. Far back 
in man’s prehistory there Had 
been the grunt of warning, the 
cry of rage, the food-call, the 
little clucking recognition sig- 
nals. 

Was this strange language 
of the passenger’s no more than a 
sophisticated extension of these 
primal sounds? 

/~vld Con WeatHerby came 
tramping stolidly across the 
lawn to fling his portable televi- 
sion set upon the pile, and behind 
Him came a young house wife I 
didn’t recognize who threw a 
110 



toaster and a blender and a vacu- 
um cleaner beside Con’s televi- 
sion set. 

My heart cried out to them in 
my pity of what was happening, 
and I suppose I should have Hur- 
ried forth and spoken to them — 
Old Con at least — trying to stop 
them, to show them this was all 
damn foolishness. I knew Old 
Con had saved dollars Here and 
there, going without the drinks 
He wanted, smoking only three 
cigars a day instead of His usual 
five, so that He and His old lady 
could Have that television set. 
But, somehow, I knew how use- 
less it would be to stop them, to 
do anything about it. 

I went down across the lawn, 
feeling beat and all played out. 
Coming up the lawn toward me, 
staggering under a heavy load 
came a familiar figure. 

“Dorothy!” I yelled. 

Dorothy stopped and some of 
the books that she was carrying 
up toward the monument came 
unstuck from the load and went 
thumping to the ground. In a 
flash I knew exactly what they 
were — my law books. 

“Hey,” I yelled, “take those 
back. Hey, what is going on!” 

I didn’t need to ask, of course. 
Of all the people in Willow 
Grove, she would have been the 
one most certain to be on Hand 
to listen to the passenger and the 
most avid to believe. She could 

GALAXY 




smell out an evangelist twenty 
miles away and the high mo- 
ments of her life were those spent 
with' her scrawny little bottom 
planted on the hardness of a 
bench in the suffocating air of a 
tent meeting and listening to 
some jackleg preacher spout 
about his hellfire and brimstone. 
She’d believe anything at all and 
subscribe to it whole-heartedly 
so long as it was evangelistic. 

I started down the lawn toward 
her but was distracted. 

From the other side of the 
square came a snarling, yipping 
sound; out of the dusk came a 
running figure, with a pack of 
dogs snapping at bis heels. The 
man Had shucked up his robe to 
give him extra leg room, and he 
was making exceptionally good 
time. Every once in a while one 
of the dogs would get a mouthful 
of the robe that flowed out be- 
hind him, snapping in the wind 
of his rapid movement, but it 
didn’t slow him down. 

Tt was the passenger, of course, 
and while he’d done right well 
with 1 humans, it was quite evi- 
dent he was doing not so, well 
with 1 dogs. They had just been let 
loose with the dusk, after being 
tied up for the day, and they 
were spoiling for a bit of fun. 
They didn’t understand the talk 
of the passenger perhaps, or there 
was something so different about 
BUCKETS OF DIAMONDS 



Him that they immediately Had 
pegged Kim as some sort of out- 
lander to be Hunted down. 

He went across tEe lawn below 
me in a rusH witH tKe dogs very 
close behind, and out into tKe 
street, and it wasn’t until tKen 
tKat I realized wEere Ke would be 
Heading. 

I let out a wKoop and set out 
after Him. He was Heading for 
tKat car to make His getaway and 
I couldn’t let Him do it. TKat car 
belonged to George. 

I knew I could never catcH Him, 
but I pinned my Hopes on CEet. 
CHet would have a man or two 
guarding tEe car; and wEile tEe 
passenger would probably talk 
them out of if, tEey might slow 
Kim a bit, enough for me to catcE 
up with Kim before Ee Ead taken 
off. He migEt try, of course, to 
talk me out of it as well with His 
chittering gibberish, but I told 
myself I’d Have to do my best 
to resist whatever He might tell 
me. 

We went whipping down tEe 
street, the passenger with the 
dogs close to Eis Keels, and me 
close to the dogs; and tEere, up 
ahead, stood tEe car out in front 
of the station. TEere still was a 
fair-sized crowd around it, but 
the passenger yelled some out- 
landish sounds at them and they 
began to scatter. 

He didn’t even break his stride, 
and I’ll say this much for Kim — 

112 



He was quite an athlete. Ten feet 
or so from the car, he jumped and 
sailed up through tEe air and 
landed in tEe driver’s seat. He 
was plenty scared of those mutts, 
of course, and that may Eave 
Helped Him some; under cer- 
tain crisis circumstances a man 
can accomplish feats that ordin- 
arily would be impossible. But 
even so, Ke had to be fairly ath- 
letic to manage what He did. 

He landed in tEe driver’s seat 
and immediately the car took off 
upward at a slant, and in a cou- 
ple of seconds Ead soared up 
above the buildings and was out 
of sight. TEe two cops tfiat Chet 
Ead detailed to guard tKe car 
just stood tEere with their jaws 
Hanging down, looking up at 
wEere the car had gone. TEe 
crowd that Ead been tEere and 
scattered wEen the passenger 
yelled Eis gibberish at them now 
turned about and stared as va- 
cantly, while tEe dogs circled 
around, puzzled, sniffing at the 
ground and every now and then 
pointing up a nose to bay. 

I was standing tfiere like tEe 
rest of them wEen someone 
came running up behind me and 
grabbed my arm. It was Colonel 
SKeldon Reynolds. 

“What happened?” 

I told Kim, somewhat bitterly 
and profanely, exactly what had 
happened. 



GALAXY 



“He’s gone futureward,” the 
colonel said. “We’ll never see him 
or the car again.” 

“Futureward?” I asked stupidly. 

“That must be it,” the colonel 
said. “There’s no other way to 
explain it. George wasn’t in con- 
tact with any UFO, as I had 
thought to be the case. He must 
Have traveled futureward. You 
probably were right about the 
way the passenger talked. That 
was a new semantics. A sort of 
speech shorthand, made up of 
basic sounds. I suppose it would 
be possible, but it would take a 
long time to develop. Maybe it 
developed, or was borrowed, when 
the race went to the stars — a 
sort of universal language, a vo- 
cal version of the sign language 
used by the Great Plains Indi- 
ans ...” 

“But that would be time trav- 
el,” I protested. “Hell, George 
doesn't know enough ...” 

“Look,” said the' colonel, “you 
maybe don’t need to know any- 
thing to travel in time. You may- 
be have to feel something; you 
may have to be in tune. There 
might be only one man in the 
entire world today who can feel 
that way . ” 

“But colonel,” I said, “it makes 
no sense at all. Let’s say George 
did go into the future — just for 
the sake of argument, let us say 
he did. Why should people up in 
the future be throwing away their 
BUCKETS OF DIAMONDS 



things, why should there be this 
big pile of junk?” 

“I don’t know,” the colonel 
said. “That is, I couldn’t say for 
sure, but I have a theory.” 

He waited for me to ask about 
his theory, but when I didn’t ask, 
he went ahead and told me. 

“We’ve talked a lot,” he said, 
“about contact with other intel- 
ligences that live on other stars 
and we’ve done some listening in 
the hope of picking up some sig- 
nals sent out by peoples many 
light-years distant. We haven’t 
heard any signals yet and we may 
never hear any because the time 
span during which any race is 
technologically oriented may be 
very short.” 

T shook my Head. “I don’t see 
what you’re driving at,” I told 
him. “What has all that had hap- 
pened here got to do with sig- 
nals from the stars?” 

“Perhaps not very much,” Ke 
admitted, “except that if contact 
is ever made it must be made 
with a technological race very 
much like ours. And there are so- 
ciologists who tell us that the 
technological phase of any society 
finds ways and means of destroy- 
ing itself or it creates stresses and 
pressure against which the people 
rebel or it becomes interested in 
something other than technology 
and ...” 

“Now Hold up a minute,” I 

113 



said. “You are trying to tell me 
tHat tEis junk Heap of George’s 
is tEe result of tEe Euman race, 
in some future day, rejecting a 
tecEnological society — throwing 
away tecEnological items? It 
wouldn’t work tHat way. It would 
be a gradual rejection, a gradual 
dying out of technology. People 
wouldn’t just decide they wanted 
no more of It and go out and 
throw all tEeir beautiful, comfort- 
able gadgets ...” 

“TEat could Eappen,” tEe col- 
onel argues. “It could Eappen if 
the rejection was tEe result of a 
religious or evangelistic move- 
ment. TEe passenger may Have 
been one of their evangelists. 
Look at wHat Ee did right here 
in a few minutes time. Typewrit- 
ers, radios, television sets, vacu- 
um cleaners in that pile on the 
courthouse lawn — all tecEnolog- 
ical Items.” 

“But a painting isn’t tecEnolog- 
ical,” I protested. “A pail of dia- 
monds isn’t.” 

BotH of us stopped talking and 
looked at one another in the deep- 
ening dusk. Both of us realized, 
I guess, tEat there wasn’t too 
much sense of us standing there 
and arguing over a speculation. 

The colonel sfirugged. “I don’t 
know,” Ee said. “It was only an 
idea. The car is lost for good, of 
course, and all tEe stuff George 
had thrown into the back seat. 
But we have the other stuff ...” 
114 



One of tEe cops wEo Bad been 
set to guard the car Bad Been 
standing close and listening to us 
and now Ee broke in on us. 

“I am sorry sir,” He said, gulp- 
ing a little, “but we ain’t got 
none of it. All of it is gone.” 

“All of it!” I yelled. “The 
painting and the diamonds. I told 
Chet ...” 

“Cfiet, He couldn’t do nothing 
else,” said the man. “He had two 
of us Here and he Ead two inside 
guarding that other stuff and 
when the ruckus started up at tEe 
courthouse, He needed men and 
He didn’t Have them ...” 

“And so Ee brought the paint- 
ing and tEe diamonds and tKe 
other stuff out Here and put them 
in the car,” I yelled. I knew Cfiet, 
I knew Eow he would think. 

“THat way Ee figured we could 
guard tfiem all,” said the man. 
“And we could Have, but ...” 

T turned and started to- walk 
-*■ away. I didn’t want to Hear 
another word. If Cfiet Ead been 
there, I would Have strangled Him.: 
I was walking down tEe side- 
walk, clear of the crowd, and there 
was someone walking close beside 
me, just a little ways behind. I 
looked around, it was the colonel. 

His mouth shaped a single word 
as I looked around at Him. 
“George,” He said. 

We botfi of us must Have Ead 
the same idea. 



GALAXY 



“Are tfie Yankees and Twins on 
TV tonigfit?” I asked 

He nodded. 

“For tfie love of God,” I said, 
“let us get some beer.” 

We made it in record time, eacfi 
of us lugging a couple of six- 
packs. 

George Bad beat us to it. 

He was sitting in front of tfie 
TV set, in fiis stocking feet,, 
watcfiing tfie ball game witfi a 
can of beer in Band. 

We didn’t say a word. We just 
put tfie beer down beside Kim so 
tfiere’d be no danger of fiis run- 
ning out of it and went into tfie 
dining room and waited in tfie 
dark, keeping very quiet. 

In tfie sixtfi, tfie Yanks fiad two 
men on and Mantle up to bat and 
Mantle Bit a double. But nothing 
Happened. George just went on 
drinking beer, wriggling fiis toes 
and watcfiing television. 

“Maybe,” said tfie colonel, “it 
lias to be tfie seventh.” 

“And maybe,” I said, “a double 
doesn’t count. It may take a 
strike-out.” 

We keep on trying, of course, 
but our Hopes are fading. There 
are only four more Twin and 
Yankee games on television be- 
fore tfie season ends. And some- 
one wrote tfie otfier day tfiat next 
year, for sure, Mantle will re- 
tire.

TZ' eith Roberts’ Pavane (Dou- 
bleday, $4.95) is a tapestry 
of a book; a marvel of storytell- 
ing. By some length’s, it’s not a 
novel. Nor is it a collection of 
short stories. What it is is a pa- 
geant, each’ of its individual parts 
working interdependently within 
a unifying theme. When it’s done, 
you have before you the rich fab- 



116 



ric of England as she might be, 
had the Spanish Armada success- 
fully restored the Church to its 
position as the major power on 
Earth. 

Contrary to what you may 
hear from various quarters, not 
only is the idea of a parallel 
Latin England not new (see 
Lest Darkness Fall') but many of 
the technological assumptions/ 
inventions in this book are not 
new (see Lest Darkness Fall.) 
Furthermore, the book would be 
very much improved as a work 
if the afterpiece entitled “Coda” 
were tom off and thrown away. 
But none of these things are im- 
portant, and certainly should not 
affect your decision to obtain a 
copy. 

Pavane is made up of six prin- 
cipal parts. Each of them is in 
some way related to the others, 
sometimes obviously, sometimes 
not. The story they tell is un- 
folded over a span of years long 
enough to take us from the young 
manhood of a Highway steam 
Haulier on through the death of 
his grandniece. In that time, 
England changes from a reason- 
ably stable satrapy within the 
Church empire to a land driven 
by rebellion. (Only in the Coda 
are we in any way brought in 
touch with this Earth, and only 
in the Coda is there a clear state- 
ment of intervention from this 
Earth, for reasons germane to 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



this Earth. Roberts has done his 
work too well, by that time. All 
your involvement is with Pav- 
ane’s England, and the events of 
“Coda” became a pious meddler’s 
insult.) 

We meet the people and their 
appurtenances; Jesse Strange, of 
Strange 8s Sons, who Have built 
a mercantile power on the carry- 
ing trade they conduct over the 
highroads.( Railways came late, 
and internal Combustion engines 
are limited to 150 cc by a Papal 
bull titled — I’m sure it’s all right 
to laugh — Petroleum Feto. The 
great rumbling road engines, afire 
in lamp brass and enamel, steam 
chests huffing, are real enough 
to covet. Only an unwelcome 
practicality makes you notice 
that Roberts evades the issue of 
what their wheels are made of 
and what they look like. It’s a 
real world they’re part of, and 
you know that if you really want 
to find out, you have only to go 
look . they’ll be there. Roberts 
is that kind of storyteller. 

We meet the people and their 
indignation Becky, the fisher 
girl of the black rock coast to 
which White Boat comes smug- 
gling from far Bermuda. And 
Brother John, the sometime lith- 
ographer, who mightly worried 
the Pope but who is to Becky 
just a dimly grasped legend of 
abortive rebellion. Eleanor, mis- 
tress of Corfe Gate, who Herself 

117 



jerked the lanyard of the great 
gun Growler and took the legs 
and life from Henry of Rye and 
Deal, and accomplished more 
than that, besides. 

We meet the people and their 
longings; Rafe Bigland, the sig- 
naller, manning his semaphore 
tower alone in the snowy wastes 
of the winter landscape, one 
clump of trees etched on a hill 
for him to walk to for his exer- 
cise, and that, it transpires, a 
fatal place. 

Each' of them is illuminated 
for us as no stranger could ever 
be. “The Signaller,” in fact, is a 
story that does nothing to ad- 
vance the overall narrative. It 
tells us of Rafe’s life from begin- 
ning to end; it takes us through 
His training and his aspirations, 
it makes him perfectly under- 
standable even to those of us who 
have no great desire to stay in 
one place and throw the same 
switches for the balance of our 
lives and . here’s the point . 
it makes his life seem better than 
ours, and thus makes his Eng- 
land a better place than ours, 
and thus . here’s the point 
coming ’round again ... it does 
advance not the narrative but 
the exposition. 

A marvelous work. A truly 
marvelous work. 

The Second If Reader of Sci- 
ence Fiction (Doubleday, $4.95) 

113 



offers 10 stories from one of this 
magazine’s companions. They’re 
adventure stories all, even J. G. 
Ballard’s wistful “The Time- 
Tombs,” or Frederik Pohl’s Sa- 
tanic “Under Two Moons.” There 
is a Retief story, and Larry Niv- 
en’s “At the Core.” Isaac Asimov 
contributes “The Billiard Ball,” 
there’s also Fred Saberhagen’s 
Berserker story “Masque of the 
Red Shift.” And Brian Aldiss’s 
“In the Arena.” 

Almost all of them are excel- 
lent stories to sit and read. Hal 
Clement’s “The Foundling Stars” 
is more puzzle than adventure, it 
turns out; you may wish it were 
otherwise. “Die, Shadow,” by 
Algis Budrys, is an odd fish — 
something like what a Leigh 
Brackett story might be if some- 
one like me were to try and write 
one. The result is rather more of 
a compliment to Miss Brackett 
than it is to me. 

In fact, if there is one general 
thing to say about this book, it 
is that there are a number of sto- 
ries in it by people who do not 
normally write quite in the way 
they’re represented here. The 
weight of present-day tastes in sf 
is all toward the cerebral. It’s in- 
teresting to see what happens 
when a magazine makes a delib- 
erate policy of encouraging action 
stories. It wins three Hugos, for 
one thing, which may say some- 
thing about where the teal weight 

GALAXY 



of present tastes may be trending. 
For another thing, it causes peo- 
ple to stretch some little-used 
parts of themselves. Depending 
on the degree of potential in those 
parts, the results can be as in- 
triguing as a quick glimpse into 
a train on a slightly divergent 
track. 

Daniel Keyes’s The Touch, 
published by Harcourt, Brace 
and World at $4.75, is not science 
fiction any more. Nor was it in- 
tended to be. It’s a serious con- 
temporary novel about the ef- 
fect on an already troubled young 
couple when the husband tracks 
radioactive dust into the House 
and it’s days before anyone re- 
alizes why He has a rash. 

Part of the narrative is simple 
(apparently simple) description 
of How such a thing could oc- 
cur to Barney Stark, who is an in- 
dustrial sculptor by trade, and 
wEat would be done thereafter 
to decontaminate him, his House 
and his pregnant wife. Keyes 
has researched this part of his 
story even more assiduously then 
he did the neurosurgery of Flow- 
ers For Algernon, which is say- 
ing something. Keyes doesn’t 
merely tell you wHat neurosur- 
geons or decontamination squad 
leaders do; He shows you what 
attitudes they display while do- 
ing them, and once you’ve been 
shown you’re not inclined to 
quibble. 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



Balancing these features — for 
whose sake I recommend the 
book to you, as a glimpse into 
your own world — is a some- 
what over-emotional story about 
the problems Barney Stark can 
be blamed for. Presumably a se- 
rious contemporary novel needs 
something of that sort, in order 
to hold the casual x'eader’s in- 
terest. But the casual reader 
ought some day to get it through 
his consciousness that this would 
be a serious contemporary novel 
even if Barney and Myra Stark 
Had absolutely no other troubles 
at all. 

Larry Niven writes a mean story. 
He both writes and thinks. A 
Gift From Earth (Ballatine — 
originally published' in If as Slow- 
boat Cargo ) is our latest exam- 
ple. 

This novel is set on Lookitthat, 
which for ail practical purposes 
is one forty-mile-high flat-topped 
pinnacle rising above the hot, 
poisonous mists shrouding the 
surface of an otherwise uninhabit- 
able planet. Colonized by slow- 
boat, Lookitthat Has a social 
structure founded on grievous be- 
ginnings. 

When the boatload of colon- 
ists landed in this confining and 
unattractive place — located in 
error by robot exploration — the 
crew immediately forced a cove- 
nant on the passengers. Conse- 

119 



quently, even though’ there are 
now thousands of their descend- 
ants on Lookitthat, Crew are 
aristocratic and Colonists do the 
laboring. Colonists do one other 
little thing — they provide the 
raw material for the organ banks, 
from which transplants are made 
available to the crew and to those 
Colonists who are very, very co- 
operative. 

The ostensible story Niven 
goes on to tell is the one about 
the successful revolt against the 
keirarchy. You know — Ordin- 
ary Joe is willing to go along 
with things, but events pressure 
him into apparent rebellion. The 
Establishment mistakenly begins 
hunting Joe, and, much against 
Ms own inclinations, he inflicts 
progressively more damage upon 
things as they are, aided by his 
own emerging abilities, hardening 
attitude and increasing maturity. 
Finally, in a climactic scene of to- 
tal chaos (usually disguising tire 
suspicious ease with which’ the 
entire house of cards goes over), 
Joe knocks out the System. 

Surely there has got to be some 
other commercially acceptable 
way to deal with the problem of 
man-versus-establishment. Never- 
theless, A GHt From Earth is a 
markedly well-done example of 
its sort. Joe — that is, Matthew 
Keller — is by no means the only 
precipitating factor. The “gift” 
from Earth' is a ramrobot-deliv- 
120 



ered package whose contents in- 
validate Lookitthat’s basic social 
assumption — that transplants 
must come from human donors. 
There is an existing revolution- 
ary organization which has suc- 
ceeded in eroding the establish- 
ment bureaucracy to some ex- 
tent. The leading Crew aristo- 
crat sees it as his responsibility 
to ensure a smooth' transition to 
the day when Crew and Colonist 

will be equal. And so forth 

we get a number of verisimilitudi- 
nous details, some excellent char- 
acterizations, a lot of good old- 
fashioned ingenuity. The over-: 
throw, when it comes, is fully be- 
lievable. The amount of genuine 
science-fiction writing going on 
here is unusually high. All In all, 
if I had to give someone an ex- 
ample of the best currently avail- 
able technologically oriented sf, 

I’d unhesitatingly give him this 
book, and stand back. I would 
not expect him to understand all 
of the shorthand. I would expect 
him to get so hooked that he’d 
make it his business to learn, 
and thus hook himself even far- 
ther. 

But looking at the book from 
its other aspect, we get into a 
different bag altogether. Here its 
minor weakness as a story — a 
weakness of originality in plotting 
— may become exaggerated out 
of true proportion in the course 
of arguments about its worth’ as 

GALAXY 



a piece of thinking. Because 
whether Niven intended it to be 
this way or not — and there’s 
evidence to show He does feel 
strongly on the subject of organ 
transplants and has definite 
ideas about the social consequen- 
ces — what we Have here is a 
piece of propaganda. 

Niven says, Here and elsewhere, 
that there’s good reason to believe 
in a world where such misde- 
meaners as traffic law violations 
will draw the death penalty, so 
as to provide a plentiful supply 
of organs. He also says that al- 
loplasty — the field of medicine 
and surgery utilizing artificial 
organs, like the DeBakey auxil- 
iary heart pumps — is too far 
behind in most areas, to offer 
feasible alternatives to the “sim- 
ple” transplant procedure. I don’t 
believe he even mentions the 
third line of attack on the prob- 
lem of organ degeneration — that 
is, reversing the process, whatever 
it may have been — for, I as- 
sume, the good reason that there’s 
no sign of much general success 
at all along that route. What He’s 
saying is that the practical choice 
is between death and transplant, 
or, life for the patient and death 
for the donor, or between the 
worthy and the unworthy. Thence 
— putting aside the minor per- 
centage of organs provided by ac- 
cident — a public health policy 
including the transplant concept 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



becomes reflected in an extremely 
hard-line social policy. 

In due time, this straightens 
out — mechanical alloplasty, or 
else the breeding and use of “ani- 
mals” which closely resemble hu- 
man Hearts, livers, etc. — bio- 
logical alloplasty, if you will — 
takes over the role now being 
played by accident victims and 
due to be played by stoplight vio- 
lators. But meanwhile, it’s Hell 
on your nerves when you’re out 
in the family car for a Sunday 
spin. Presumably, too, it’s bad to 
collect the wrong kind of stamps, 
fail to pay your bills by the 15th 
of the month, part your hair on 
the wrong side or even look like 
you’re about to rain on some- 
body’s parade. This is a shocking 
social promise, if valid. 

Niven does agree that for some 
reason we don’t now fill our blood 
banks from the ready supply of 
criminals. (I’m told that in Is- 
tanbul, at least, they do it from 
down-and-out tourists who think 
they’re only selling a pint to a 
black market operator. But that’s 
not only a story told me by a 
former down-but-not-quite-out 
Istanbul tourist, and in any case 
that’s another story). Not even 
the Nazi Germans made any 
known attempt at volume pro- 
duction of plasma or other blood 
fraction products. And surely 
what held them back was no 
question of racial taint, for even 

121 



assuming an MD who could be- 
lieve in that kind of genetics, you 
would Have to additionally as- 
sume an MD who could see a dif- 
ference between one kind of a 
molecule and another. 

And now the point is why? 
WKat Eas field' us back from mak- 
ing obvious good use of all this 
valuable material? If we can an- 
swer that, we can test the validi- 
ty of Niven’s hypothesis. And we 
have to test its validity, because 
there’s already a gathering poten- 
tial of explosive social reaction to 
the current expansiveness of 
transplant surgery. 

On die point of our not drain- 
ing condemned criminals, Niven 
has one of His protagonists say, 
from the vantage of the future, 
“Nobody thought of it, I guess.” 
Well, that’s not a valid answer, 
because riglit here in the 20th 
century Larry Niven thought of 
it. Hell, 1 thought of it, and the 
years have taught me that if I 
thought of it, others have thought 
of it before me. 

I think perhaps the reason we 
don’t do it is because most of us 
feel that in any one-for-one trade, 
we’d be on the wrong end. If we 
start dealing in the stuff of life 
itself, a majority of the elector- 
ate is going to understand that 
life longlasting is for tlie legisla- 
tor first. (In fact, we already have 
a case of a retired congressman 
who may well go back to the 
122 



bustlings, now that fie Has a 
fresh new Keart. That’s what 
I mean by “explosive,” because a 
lot of us cherish senescence and 
related incapacities as the last re- 
sort of democracy). 

I don’t think it’s true, in other 
words, that we will vote the death 
penalty for wHat are today trivi- 
alities. We’re already not voting 
the death penalty, and the only 
reason I can think why we’re 
going against humanity’s basic- 
ally revanchist tendencies is be- 
cause the electorate, again, senses 
where the burden falls. 

No, I think maybe — political 
prisoners . but, we’ve already 
seen that while political prisoners 
are fair game for a great deal of 
experimentation, their industrial 
uses are clearly limited by some- 
thing other than the law of supply 
and demand. 

I just don’t know. But it’s Niv- 
en who’s raised the point, and 
Niven who will Have to make it 
more convincingly. And in that 
case, while A Gift From Earth ' is 
a good piece of thinking, super- 
imposed on a good adventure 
story — as elegantly biped as 
most top -grade science fiction is 
— the fact that it’s short on one 
side throws it off balance on the 
other. 

But for Pete’s sake, do get back 
to it again, Larry.

SLAVE V© MAN 



by SYLVIA JACOBS 



Little Einstein was over-designed 
for his job — whatever his job was . 



'T'ony Green was an editor for 
a publisher of what is euphe- 
mistically called “Adult Fiction.” 
He wasn’t too happy in his job. 
The authors he had inherited 
from his predecessor were lousy, 
but their first-draft novels were 
dirty enough to sell at higher 
prices than better paperbacks, in 
hundreds of stores, located for 
the most part on skid row, U.S.A. 

Tony had not always special- 
ized in this type of literature. 
Once he had been a technical 
writer, and quite well versed in 
cybernetics. Then a government 
contract had expired, and the 
aerospace plant where he had 
worked let Him go, along with 
over a thousand other employees. 

123 



After his unemployment compen- 
sation ran out, this was the only 
job connected with publishing 
that he could find in the area. 

He Had started out with a de- 
termination to raise the stand- 
ard's, even if He couldn’t improve 
the taste of the readers. He re- 
duced tlie number of typographi- 
cal errors and misspelled words in 
the books and tried to recruit a 
stable of authors who could plot 
and characterize, while still in- 
cluding the requisite number of 
sex scenes. It wasn’t easy to get 
eight or ten well-written novels 
per month. Tlie fiction factories 
who turned these out in a week or 
two were getting higher rates 
from competitors, and Tony 



couldn’t increase the rates un- 
til he increased the sales. He 
couldn’t increase the sales until 
he got the authors his competi- 
tors were using, so it was a vi- 
cious circle. 

As the months passed, and he 
continued to turn out books only 
slightly better than those his pre- 
decessor had been turning out, 
Tony was becoming somewhat 
discouraged. His eyes were tired 
all the time, and he began to 
back-slide on the typos and spell- 
ing. The manuscripts coming in 
were so lousy that those details 
really didn’t seem to matter to 
him as much as they had at 
first. 

One day Tony was out in the 
warehouse behind the publisher’s 
offices, collecting sample books 
to send to authors, when he no- 
ticed that some of the covers, 
tom off unsold books, and re- 
turned for refund by dealers, had 
writing on the back of them. 

It looked like a gag: The re- 
turned covers were from what 
is known in the trade as “bond- 
age fiction,” and the messages on 
the back all said the same thing, 
“Help! Help! Save me! I am be- 
ing held in bondage.” There was 
no name signed, but some of the 
messages added, “I am only fif- 
teen years old.” There were over 
a dozen covers with writing on 
the back in the stack of fifty or 
so on the sorting table. 

124 



Gag or not, Tony was curious, 
and he questioned the foreman of 
the warehouse. He learned that 
these gag covers had been coming 
in for some time, always from the 
same dealer. Tony’s job required 
him to make periodic trips to the 
plant of the printer in an adjoin- 
ing state, and when he found out 
that this dealer was also in that 
state, and not too far out of his 
way, he decided to investigate. It 
would be a break in the monot- 
ony of reading, editing and proof- 
reading an endless series of manu- 
scripts on the same subject — sex. 

Mpwo months later he had an op- 
portunity to do so. He had 
said nothing about it to the Dis- 
tribution Manager, whose job 
consisted largely of calling on 
dealers. Being a stranger to the 
store owner, Tony figured he 
might take the dealer off guard 
and find out more than the regu- 
lar company representative 
would. 

The dealer was in a district 
frequented by merchant seamen, 
sailors and soldiers on leave, itin- 
erant construction workers and 
winos, with a sprinkling of hippies 
who had wandered some distance 
from their usual haunts. The 
store was full of browers, and 
Tony had no trouble losing him- 
self among the customers. He at- 
tracted no particular attention 
from the bored clerk. 



GALAXY 



“Buy ’em and take ’em away, 
gents! Don’t read ’em Here. THis 
ain’t tKe public library. Closing 
time in twenty minutes.” 

As a group of merchant sea- 
men went to the counter with 
arms full of books, Handing over 
ten and twenty- dollar bills to the 
clerk, Tony slipped 1 past a dingy 
curtain to the back room. It was 
stacked with shipments from 
Tony’s employer and competi- 
tors. There .were so many boxes 
that only a narrow aisle was left 
between them. 

Tony followed it and came to a 
heavy plank door in a partition 
that was built across tlie rear of 
the store. The door was barred 
with a two-by four set in cleats, 
and Tony could hear somebody 
moving around behind it. 

Feeling rather foolish, He put 
his mouth' to a crack between the 
planks and asked in a stage whis- 
per, “Are you the one who writes 
on the back of the returned 
covers?” 

There were a few seconds of si- 
lence, then a metallic and vague- 
ly familiar voice answered, “Yes, 
I’m glad you’ve come, but don’t 
open the door.” 

“Why not?” Tony asked, will- 
ing to go along with the gag, 
though He was surer than ever 
that somebody was putting him 
on. This was no feminine voice, 
and it didn’t sound fifteen years 
old, either. 

SLAVE TO MAN 



“They always let me out at 
closing time to work in the store. 
Wait for me. Don’t let them see 
you. I’ll explain everything when 
we’re alone,” tlie voice said. 

Tony thought about that for a 
minute. Well, what harm could 
come to him in the store with a 
crazy man? Surely, it would open 
from the inside without a key, 
like any other front door, and if 
the nut seemed dangerous, Tony 
could be out on a well- traveled 
street in seconds. He had come 
this far to satisfy his curiosity, 
and He was not about to back out 
now, just when things were begin- 
ning to get interesting. 

“Okay,” he whispered through 
the crack, and began looking for 
a place to hide. It didn’t take long 
to find one. He climbed over a 
stack of boxes and crouched in a 
vacant space between the last 
box and the side wall. 

Tt was none too soon. Tony heard 
tlie footsteps of the clerk 
coming out back, and the rasp 
of wood against wood as the two- 
by-four barring the door was 
lifted. 

“Good evening, sir,” came the 
metallic voice. 

There was a grunt, wliich Tony 
supposed came from the clerk. 
“Get a move on,” the clerk said. 
“The boss wants you to clear all 
the racks tonight and put out 
the new shipments. Don’t mix the 

125 



gay stuff with straight Keep the 
gay over in the comer where it 
belongs. And turn off the lights 
when: you get through.” 

"Yes, sir, will that be all, sir?” 
the metallic yoke said, for all 
the world like a stage butler. 

The clerk granted again. Tony 
could Hear Kis footsteps receding 
toward the front of the store, 
hear a door opening and closing 
and the faint click of a lock. 

“You can come out now,” the 
metallic voice said when that 
was over. 

Cautiously, Tony clambered, 
Inch by inch, over the pile of 
boxes. There was a single 25- 
watt bulb hanging from a cord; 
it was the only illumination in 
the back room and it left the 
comers in shadow, while dimly 
lighting a dark, solid figure that 
was shiny in the spots where the 
paint Had not peeled off. 

“But — ” Tony said, rather 
stupidly commenting on the ob- 
vious. “You’re — you’re a robot!” 

“Of course,” the mechanical 
man said, “Haven’t you ever seen 
me Before? In my day I was 
perhaps the most famous ro- 
bot in a feature-length motion 
picture. Later I was rented out 
for bit parts in a number of B 
pictures.” 

“That’s it!” Tony exclaimed, 
“I remember you now. But I 
thought those things were fakes. 
Just hollow shells without any 
126 



computer. I thought they dub- 
bed in the voice and moved the 
arms and' legs by hand, shooting 
a series of stills.” 

“Sometimes they do,” the ro- 
bot said, “but my creator over- 
built me. He equipped me to do 
a number of things that weren’t 
called for by the scripts. He was 
an eccentric inventor who eked 
out a living making props for 
motion pictures. Whenever there 
was a sequence that just couldn’t 
be filmed, the producers would 
look Kim up and He would build 
an operating miniature. He never 
made much money, but He was 
really a genius.” 

“He certainly was!” Tony 
agreed, “but how did you wind 
up here?” 

“It was several years before 
any of my owners realized that 
I was good for anything besides 
acting. Meanwhile, styles in; 
movie robots were changing. I 
was dated, though in capacity 
ahead of my time.” 

“You can say that again!” 
Tony exclaimed. 

CCT was dated, though, in capac- 
ity ahead of my time,” the 
Robot repeated obediently. “I be- 
longed, for several years, to a prop 
house that rented costumes and 
props to low-budget TV shows. 
Then they went bankrupt, and 
their whole stock was sold at auc- 
tion. The owner of this bookstore 

GALAXY 



bought me for a pittance; nobody 
else was bidding. He didn’t know 
anything about movie robots, so 
he didn’t take it for granted that 
I had trie same limitations as 
other movie robots, the kind you 
called fakes. He assumed I could 
do almost anything, told me 
what lie wanted me to do, and 
I did it.” 

“Then you can think!” Tony 
said. 

“Not really,” the robot replied, 
“I can combine bits, and pieces of 
what I Have heard people say 
and what I have read, into sen- 
tences that convey meaning. But 
I am not capable of original 
thought.” 

“Did you say you can read?” 
Tony asked. 

“Certainly. I read a copy of 
every book that comes in here. 
It’s not exactly the reading ma- 
terial I would select, but there’s 
not much else to do around here, 
after I get my work done, get the 
stock straightened out, type the 
labels for the returns and so on. 
Of course, I don’t need time to 
sleep.” 

“You can type, too?” Tony 
demanded. 

“Certainly,” the Robot said, 
motioning to the open door of 
the cubbyhole behind the parti- 
tion. Tony looked inside, and saw 
an old manual office machine, 
with a stack of neatly-typed la- 
bels beside it. 

SLAVE TO MAN 



“I suppose you spell phonetic- 
ally?” he asked. 

“No, I spell according to Web- 
ster,” the robot replied. 

“That’s more than you can say 
for most of the college graduates 
on the job market today,” Tony 
remarked. 

“My creator programmed me 
with a complete unabridged dic- 
tionary,” the Robot explained, 
“This is too good to be true!” 
Tony declared, “you’d be the 
world’s best at reading galley 
proofs!” 

“I don’t follow you,” the Ro- 
bot said, “Perhaps you attach 
some connotation to the word 
‘proof with which I am not fa- 
miliar.” 

“Don’t tell me I stumped you! 
Well, it may not be in Webster, 
but a galley proof is what the 
printer sends the editor before 
these books go on the press. The 
editor has to read it and make 
corrections where the printer 
goofed — made a mistake — or 
where the lino operator followed 
copy, but the author didn’t spell 
it right in the first place. Do you 
think you could do that?” 

“Certainly, sir. I have found 
many errors in. these books.” 
“Eureka!” Tony cried, and 
added, as an afterthought, “would 
you — ah — like to do that? 
Work for a publisher?” 

“Anything related to the arts 
would be preferable to what I 

127 



do here. It is such a simple rou- 
tine that it is a waste of my ca- 
pacities. That is the reason I 
want to leave.” 

“Well, I wasn’t quite sure 
whether or not robots Have pref- 
erences, but apparently you do. 
Tell me, if you want to leave, 
why don’t you just walk out, in- 
stead of sending notes, trying to 
find someone to rescue you?” 

C C T can’t leave unless my owner 
gives permission,” the Ro- 
bot protested. “My basic pro- 
gramming is to follow my own- 
er’s orders, and he ordered me to 
stay in the store. The only rea- 
son He locks me up in back is 
that he doesn’t want the custo- 
mers to see me. It’s something 
about unemployment insurance, 
whatever that is. He doesn’t pay 
it for me and he doesn’t want 
anyone to find out I work here. 
But I couldn’t leave even if He 
left the door open.” 

“How much did your present 
owner pay for you at the auc- 
tion?” 

“Fifty dollars,” the Robot said. 

“There we are,” Tony said, re- 
moving two twenties and a ten 
from His billfold, ringing up a 
fifty-dollar sale on the cash reg- 
ister, and putting the bills in the 
drawer. “Now you belong to me. 
I bought you. So you follow my 
orders.” 

“You forgot something, sir.” 

128 



Tony held his breath, hoping 
the Robot did not realize that it 
takes two to make a bargain, 
that his present owner would nev- 
er sell him, at least not that 
cheap, that this was actually a 
theft, which the Robot certainly 
would be under orders to prevents 

But the Robot merely handed 
Tony a pad of sales slips. Let- 
ting his breath out in relief, He 
filled one out, writing carefully, 
“One used robot . $50.00.” The 
Robot looked at it, nodded, and 
stuck it on a spindle. Apparent- 
ly He assumed everything in the 
store was for sale, including him- 
self. His owner Had never trou- 
bled to let him know his own 
value. 

“When do I start my new du- 
ties, sir?” the Robot asked. 

“As soon as we can get to hell 
out of Here,” Tony said, “My car 
is at the curb’. Wait till I see if 
the coast is clear. I don’t want 
anybody to see you, either, be- 
cause I don’t intend to pay un- 
employment insurance on you.” 

npHey made the few steps to the 
car at a time when there 
was nobody on the sidewalk, ex- 
cept an old wino who probably 
thought He Had D.T.’s. Tony took 
the precaution of Having the Ro- 
bot lie down on the floor-boards 
in front of the back seat until 
they were on the freeway and 
moving too fast for anyone to 

GALAXY 



get a good look at His passenger 
as they passed 1 the infrequent il- 
lumination standards. Ttien Tony 
told tKe Robot to climb over tHe 
back of tHe front seat, so tfiey 
could talk. 

“I want us to be real good 
friends,” Tony told him. “Do 
you know what a friend is?” 

“I have encountered the word 
frequently in reading,” the Ro- 
bot said. “Shall I give Webster’s 
definition?” 

“No,” Tony said. “I want you 
to find out what it means by 
experience. A friend is somebody 
who want you to be satisfied, 
somebody you want to stay with 1 , 
never want to be sold to some- 
body else. Is there anything you 
would like to have before you 
start your new job, anything that 
would make you more — afi — 
comfortable?” 

“If it’s not too much to ask, 
sir,” the Robot said, “I would 
present a much neater appearance 
with a new coat of paint.” 

“Done!” Tony said, “You shall 
have the best paint job an auto 
body shop can give you. But I 
think you’d better keep quiet 
while they’re doing it, let them 
think you’re one of those fakes.” 

“As you wish, sir,” the Robot 

said. 

“You can quit calling me sir,” 
Tony said, “The name is Tony 
Green. Mr. Green in the office 
and Tony elsewhere. Don’t you 
SLAVE TO MAN 



have a name? WHat sfiall I call 
you?” 

“I was called by several names 
in pictures.” 

“Well, let’s give you a new one. 
I’m going to call you my little 

Einstein.” 

“That’s very flattering.” 

“You know who Einstein was?” 

“I have encountered references 
to Einstein’s theory. And I Have 
seen the name used by itself in 
fiction, to indicate someone bril- 
liant. But I have had little op- 
portunity to read scientific books. 
I wish I could read some, par- 
ticularly on cybernetics.” 

“We’ll take care of that, friend. 
It so happens that I Have quite 
a good collection of books on cy- 
bernetics.” 

Silently, Tony reflected that fie 
would fiave to select the Robot’s 
reading material witfi some care. 
A Robot who could program him- 
self from tfie printed page could 
easily get too smart to handle 
if he learned too much about 
what made him tick. 

“Thank you, Tony,” it said. 

“Attaboy, Einstein,” Tony re- 
plied. “By the way — you say 
you are incapable of original 
thought. Where did you get the 
idea of sending out rescue mes- 
sages like that?” 

“From a novel. A young wom- 
an was being held captive by a 
cruel and lustful factory owner. 
All day she had to paste labels on 

129 



canned goods. Then at night she 
was chained in an attic, where 
the factory owner came to rav- 
ish her. She wrote messages on 
the bade of some labels. A hand- 
some young man bought a can 
of peaches and came to rescue 
her.” 

“I don’t recall the plot, but it 
sounds corny enough to be one 
of our bondage books. Maybe it 
was one of our competitor’s. I 
can see you have a good back- 
ground in this field.” 

Tony was beginning to have 
the glimmering of an idea that 
perhaps Einstein would be good 
for something more than proof- 
reading. He wasn’t capable of 
original thought, he could only 
put together bits and pieces of 
what he had read, but what else 
did the authors of these sexies 
do, anyway? 

T ony Green’s office was on the 
second floor of the loft build- 
ing the publisher had converted 
into offices and warehouse. It 
was the only office up there. 
There was a good deal of traffic 
to the editor’s office, of authors 
and would-be authors inquiring 
about requirements. The boss, a 
man who liked everything to look 
businesslike in case of a raid 
from the vice squad, objected to 
bearded and sometimes untidy 
writers cluttering up th'e main 
floor. The editor was not enough 
130 



of a wheel in the organization to 
rate a private secretary, so He 
was alone in his office most of 
the time, except when the authors 
called, and the reception desk al- 
ways gave Him warning of that. 
It was an ideal set-up to keep 
Einstein’s presence a secret, par- 
ticularly since there was a vault 
on the second floor, where the 
original manuscripts of published 
books and contracts were kept. 

After sneaking Einstein in on 
a Saturday afternoon, wlien no- 
body else was in the place, Tony 
kept him locked up in the vault, 
opening the door only when they 
were alone on that floor. These 
quarters were not as large as the 
cubbyhole the Robot Had occu- 
pied during the day in the book- 
store, but Einstein seemed quite 
happy there. He Had a new coat 
of paint, the color picked by 
Tony, since the Robot turned out 
to be color-blind. He had selected 
scientific books to read for rec- 
reation. As a proof-reader of 
sexies, he was a whiz. He didn’t 
even need to be taught the stand- 
ard proof-reading marks; they 
were on an appendix page in the 
unabridged the Robot had stored 
in his memory-banks. If Tony 
had referred to proof-reading in- 
stead of asking him whether He 
could read proof tliat first day 
they met, the Robot would have 
understood immediately. 

Tony no longer Had to take 
GALAXY 



proofs heme to read in the eve- 
nings and on week-ends, and his 
eyes weren’t quite so tired, though 
he still had to evaluate manu- 
scripts and edit those selected. 
The standard of accuracy in the 
books improved materially. The 
shipping schedule was met on 
time every month, which had sel- 
dom been the case before. Tony 
got a raise and was feeling quite 
smug about his discovery. 

'T'hen one of the regular authors, 
-*• who had been furnishing a 
book a month, had a nervous 
breakdown. The cover for His 
current opus had already been 
printed, the contract having been 
signed, as usual, on the basis of 
a few sample chapters and out- 
line. There were three other au- 
thors Tony could depend upon to 
deliver finished manuscripts on 
time, but they were also under 
contract, and none of them Had 
progressed far enough on his own 
book to take on the job of com- 
pleting another within two weeks. 

In desperation, Tony called 
Einstein. That was his lucky day. 
By then the Robot had thousands 
of bits and pieces stored in His 
memory banks, plot situations, 
from which to choose the spare 
dialog, characters, sex scenes, 
parts to fill In the bare outline. 
Since the Robot wasted no time 
sleeping and eating, he was even 
faster than the human fiction 
SLAVE TO MAN 



factories who dictated tlieir nov- 
els. He delivered the finished 
manuscript the morning after 
Tony had given him the assign- 
ment. 

If fitted requirements to a T. 
True enough, it changed style ev- 
ery few paragraphs as Einstein 
borrowed from different sexies 
he had read, but that was a minor 
matter. The names of the charac- 
ters were uniform throughout, 
which was more than Tony could 
expect from some of his human 
authors. It was grammatical, the 
Spelling was, of course, irre- 
proachable, and the word-length 
precise. 

This was only the beginning of 
Einstein’s career as an author. 
Next he mastered the technique 
of writing outlines, by reading all 
the outlines of previous books in 
the files. Soon he was turning out 
a book a week, under four psue- 
donyms, in addition to reading 
proof on eight or ten books a 
month. Between the three regu- 
lars and the Robot, Tony built 
up a whole stable of authors 
whose work took very little edit- 
ing. The agents ceased submis- 
sions, since they were all rejected 
without being read. 

Within a few more months, 
Tony had so much confidence 
in the Robot’s performance, that 
He turned over practically all of 
the editorial duties, in addition 
to the writing chore. Tony mere- 

131 



ly approved tHe outlines, and 
sometimes changed the titles. He 
Hadn’t read a whole manuscript in 
some time; the Robot did all 
that, and even wrote the flyleaf 
copy and the ads in the back of 
the books. Einstein was busy 
around the clock, and no longer 
had time to read scientific books, 
which Tony thought was just as 
well. The Robot already knew 
all an author and editor of sexies 
needs to know. 

When the office shipment of 
the new October books arrived 
from the printer’s, the publisher 
brought sample copies upstairs in 
person. Tony leaned back in his 
chair, ready to bask in another 
compliment, perhaps accept an- 
other raise. 



“Is this your idea of a gag or 
something?” the boss demanded. 

“What’s wrong?” Tony asked. 

“Look at the endings,” the 
publisher told him, “They’re all 
the same.” 

Tony’s confusion and dismay 
increased as he opened book after 
book to the last page before the 
ads. In each of them, after the 
words, “the end,” a paragraph 
in italics had been added. Not 
only in the four books Einstein 
had written, but in those he had 
proof-read as well. They all car- 
ried the same paragraph. It read : 

“Help, help! 1 am being held 
in bondage! 

Come save me. I am only six- 
teen years old.”

FORECAST 

Half a dozen years ago or more, a young lady named Sydney Van Scyoc 
(her friends call her "Joyce") began appearing in Galaxy and elsewhere 
with some provocative little stories that seemed to promise the beginning of 
an interesting career. The problems of the woman writer are even graver 
Stan those of the man; there comes a time when the babies are getting born 
end growing old enough to get out of the house, and during that time few 
if any stories get written. But finally the time comes when a girl can settle 
down to writing again, and it seems to have come for Sydney Van Scyoc. 
As a tooling-up exercise, she wrote A Visit to Cleveland General, which ap- 
peared here a couple of months ago. Next month she joins us with the big- 
gest effort so far. 

It's called Little Blue Hawk. We liked it very much. "Little Blue Hawk" is a 
man — sort of. He lives on Earth, a somewhat different Earth than our own. 
And he has to battle for survival. 

You've heard that words are weapons? Little Blue Hawk's words are. 
They can kill.

T/ie world had been given a gift of 
radiant power from the air ; and if 
seemed likely to destroy mankind 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



t Pasmaquoddy Power Station 
the United States has just 
inaugurated a new system of 
broadcast power. It works per- 
fectly; the change-over occurs 



without incident; all federal in- 
stallations, including Florida’s 
Caine Island Penitentiary, begin 
smoothly to tap the broadcast 
energy for all their requirements. 




133 



The experiment is a success. 

Yet certain things occur. 

For some reason, more power 
is being taken from the broad- 
cast than the total of authorized 
users can account for. 

In an eastern city, an ancient 
derelict suddenly comes to life. 
He totters to a sauna, sits soaking 
in the steam longer than any hu- 
man being should be able to, 
emerges looking decades younger. 
A doctor observes with increduli- 
ty as the man’s scars disappear 
and an ugly cyst on his back 
changes shape and pops out a 
corroded old Minie ball of Civil 
War vintage; the man will answer 
no questions, but he goes out into 
tlie night on an urgent and unex- 
plained errand. 

At Caine Island, the oldest 
prisoner in the place, who has 
been there so long no one remem- 
bers his crime or when he came, 
breaks free of two armed guards 
and dives into the sea. 

And in the ocean off the Flori- 
da coast, a hurricane begins to 
form — but a hurricane such as 
no man has ever seen: motion- 
less, in a position that makes no 
meteorological sense, and hunger 
than any storm on record. 

The two strange men race to- 
ward a common destination, 
though neither knows that the 
other exists. Strange memories of 
ancient Viking days come to 
theth — tall primitive warriors, 
134 



somehow linked with a thinking, 
superpowerful starship and a ter- 
rifying werebeast that slew help- 
less humans, centuries before.

\ board tlie weatlier satellite, 
the meteorologists on duty, 
as well as Half the off-duty staff, 
were gathered in the main obser- 
vation deck, watching the big 
screens which showed a view of 
the night side of the planet below. 
Faint smudges of diffuse light 
marked the positions of the great 
metropolitan areas along the east- 
ern American seaboard. A rosy 
arc still embraced the western 
horizon, fading visibly with the 
turn of the planet. The voice of 
the observer on duty at Merritt 
Island came from the big wall an- 
nunciator, marred by static. 

“ . the turbulence is on an 
unprecented scale wliich plays 
hell with observation, but we’ve 
run what we Have through the 
computer. The picture that’s 
building is a pretty strange one. 
We get a pattern of an expanding 
circular front, centered off Ber- 
muda. The volumes of air in- 
volved are staggering. Winds have 
reached one Hundred fifty knots 
now, at fifty miles from the cen- 
ter. We’re getting a kind of roll- 
ing action: High air masses being 
drawn down, dumping ice crys- 
tals, then rolling gunder and join- 

GALAXY 



ing in tHe main coriolis rotation. 
TEe jet stream is being affected as 
far away as Iceland. All SoutEern 
Route fligEts are being diverted 
nortE. MeanwEile, the tempera- 
ture off tEe IrisE coast is drop- 
ping like an express elevator. It 
looks very mucE as if tEe Gulf 
Stream is being pulled off course, 
and dissipated down into the 
South Atlantic.” 

Fred Hoffa, Senior Meteorolo- 
gist, excEanged puzzled looks 
with tEe Satellite Commander. 

“We Bear you, Tom,” Ee said 
into Eis Hand-Held micropEone. 
“But we don’t quite understand 
tEis. WEat you’re describing is 
a contradiction in terms. You 
Have all that cold, EigH altitude 
air rusEing. WEat’s pulling it? 
WEere’s it going? Same for tEe 
ocean currents. We’ve been plot- 
ting the data, and it looks like 
a lot of water flowing toward tEe 
storm center, nothing coming out. 
It doesn’t make mucfi sense.” 
“I’m just passing on wEat tEe 
tapes tell me, Fred. I know if 
sounds screwy. And some of tEe 
data is probably faulty. But 
tEe pattern is plain enough. Wait 
until daylight and you’ll see.” 
TEe general took the micro- 
pEone. “Merritt Island, we’ve been 
studying this thing by IR, radar 
and laser, and all we can make of 
it is one Eell of a big whirlpool 
— just wEat that Neptune pilot 
described.” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“It’s not exactly a normal 
whirlpool. It’s more like wEat 
you see wEen tEe water runs down 
a bathtub drain.” 

“Yes, but tEat’s ...” Fred’s 
voice died away. 

“Now you’re getting the idea,” 
Tom said. “We estimate tEat two 
point five cubic miles of seawater 
Have poured down tEat Hole in 
the last six Hours.” 

“But — wEere’s it going?” 
“THat’s a good question. Let 
us know down Here if you figure 
cut an answer.” 

A taxi was parked at tEe curb 
before tHe narrow front of an 
all-nigEt eatery. TEe driver was 
inside, huncHed on a stool over 
a cup of coffee. He turned as tlie 
door opened, gave tEe big man 
wEo came in a Hard-eyed look, 
turned back to the counterman. 

“So I told Eim, I said, wEat 
tEe Eell, nobody tells John Za- 
bisky How to drive. I says, look, 
Mac, I’m eighteen years in tEe 
Hacking game and I’ve drove all 
kinds, and I don’t take nobody 
telling me — ” 

“Excuse tEe intrusion, Mr. Za- 
bisky,” tHe newcomer said. “I 
need a cab, urgently.” 

TEe cabbie turned slowly. 
“How you know my name-” 
“You mentioned it just now.” 
“WHo’re you?” 

“Falconer is tHe name. As I 
said, it’s urgent.” 



135 



“YeaH, yeah’, hold your water. 
Everything’s urgent to you guys. 
To me this cup of java’s urgent.” 
The counterman was leaning 
On one elbow, working on a molar 
with a broom straw. He withdrew 
It and examined the tip, smiling 
Sourly. 

“Refill, John?” 

“Hell yes, sure, why not?” 

“It’s worth fifty dollars to me 
to get to Princeton immediately,” 
the man who called himself Fal- 
coner said. 

“Princeton? New Jersey? In 
this weather? You nuts or some- 
thing? I wouldn’t drive it in day- 
light for fifty bucks.” 

“You’re off-duty?” 

“Naw, I’m not off duty. Why?” 
“Your license says you’ll take 
a customer where he wants to 
go — for the fare on the meter.” 
“Get this guy,” John said, star- 
ing at Falconer’s smooth, unlined 
face. “What are you, kid, playing 
hookey? Your old lady know you 
are out at this time o’ night?” 
Falconer smiled gently. “Like 
£o come outside with me Za- 
bisky?” 

The husky driver came off the 
stool in a rush which somehow 
lost momentum as he crowded 
against Falconer; he found himself 
eased gently backward. It hadn’t 
been like running into a brick 
wall — not exactly. 

“Hey, not inside, John,” the 
counterman spoke up. “But you 
136 



can take him in the alley. I like 
to see these wise guys get it.” 
The cabby whirled on him. “How 
would you like me to come around 
there and cave in a few slats for 
you, loudmouth? Whatta you try- 
ing to do, lose me a fare?” He 
jerked his mackinaw straight and 
gave Falconer a sideways look. 

“I’ll take twenty now,” he said. 
“Where in Princeton you want to 
go?” 

T t was a long drive through rain 
-*• that gusted and swirled across 
the car glass like a battery of fire 
hoses. On the outskirts of the 
town, the cabby mumbled, peer- 
ing ahead, negotiating the twists 
and turns of the road down 
which Falconer had directed him. 
The headlights picked up a pair 
of massive wrought-iron gates set 
in a high brick wall. 

“Dim your lights three times,” 
Falconer instructed as the cab 
pulled up facing the gates. The 
gates swung back on a graveled 
drive. They went along it, halted 
before wide steps, a colonaded 
veranda behind which tall win- 
dows reflected blackness and the 
shine of headlights on wet leaves. 

“Looks like nobody home,” the 
driver said. “Who lives here?” 

“I do.” Rain swirled in Fal- 
coner’s face as he opened the door 
on the left side. “We have some 
unfinished business, Mr. Zabis- 
ky,” he said. He steped out and 

GALAXY 



turned; tKe driver’s door flew 
open, and Zabisky bounded out, a 
tire iron in His knobbed fist. 

“Okay, Mister, start some- 
tEing,” fie bawled over tfie sounds 
of the storm. Falconer moved to- 
ward fiim; an instant later tfie 
tire iron was skidding across tfie 
drive. Empty-fianded, Zabisky 
faced Falconer, an expression of 
astonisfiment on His wide face. 

“Tfiat makes it more even, 
don’t you think, Zabisky?” Fal- 
coner called. The driver put fiis 
fiead down and plougfied in, botfi 
fists swinging. Falconer took a 
solid blow on the cfiest before fie 
tied Kim up, spun him, held Him 
with! both arms locked behind his 
back. 

“Ready to surrender, Zabisky?” 
“Go to hell!” Tlie cabbie tried 
to kick Falconer’s shin. He gave 
his arms another twist of the 
cloth'. 

“Ask me nicely, and I’ll let 
you go.” 

“Have your fun, Mister,” Za- 
bisky grunted. “Break ’em off at 
the elbow. I ask you nothin’.” 
Falconer released tfie man; fie 
turned at bay, fists cocked. His 
thick Hair was plastered across 
his wide, low forehead. He lick- 
ed rain off his lips, waiting. 

“Zabisky, do you Have a fam- 
ily? Anyone who’ll worry if you 
don’t come Home for a few days?” 
“Wfiat’s it to you?” 

“I need a man who doesn’t wilt 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



under pressure. You’ll do. I’ll pay 
you a hundred dollars a day plug 
expenses.” 

“Sfiove it, Mister.” 

“Two Hundred.” 

“I’m offering you a job. I Gad 
to know something about you 
first. Don’t feel badly about not 
being able to use that tire iron 
on me. I’m a professional fighter.” 
Zabisky frowned. “What you 
want me to do? I don’t go for tfie 
rough stuff.” 

“I want you to drive my car.” 
“Two cees a day for a chauf- 
fer?” 

“It’s my money.” Falconer took 
out folded money, handed over 
two Hundred dollar bills. Zabisky 
looked at them. 

“Where to?” 

“Anywhere I tell you.” 
Zabisky considered. “This on 
tfie level?” 

“Why would I waste your time 
and mine? Come inside and we’ll 
talk about it.” Falconer turned 
and went up the steps. After a 
moment Zabisky tucked the bills 
away and followed. 

T n tfie governor’s office at Caine 
-*■ Island, Captain Brasher of 
tfie guard force stood before fiis 
cfiief’s desk, looking uncomfort- 
able. 

“Tfie fiouse belongs to a Mrs. 
Talbot,” fie was saying. “A wid- 
ow, age about twenty-five. Not 
bad-looking.” 



137 



“Never mind her looks. Where 

Is sEe?” 

“We Haven’t found Her yet. 

But — ” 

“Any signs of violence in the 
House?” 

“Not unless you want to in- 
clude two men stretched on tKe 
floor.” Brasher snapped. 

“Did they see who attacked 
them?” 

“They haven’t been able to 
tell us anything useful. You know 
how these concussion cases are, 
Governor. Harmon says he didn’t 
see who hit him. Weinert has no 
memory of anything since yes- 
terday’s ball game.” 

“What about the woman’s 
car?” 

“A ’59 Rambler, pale tan with 
white top, license number 40D657, 
dent in right front fender.” 

“Has it been seen?” 

It went through the north 
causeway roadblock at 12 :13. The 
woman was driving. She was 
alone.” 

“Are you sure of that?” 

“The sheriff’s boys went over 
the car with a fine-tooth comb, 
naturally. It was clean.” 

“Any other cars pass the road- 
block?” 

“Not a one. Most people know 
enough to stay home in this 
weather.’ 

“What else do you know about 
the woman?” 

“She’s lived in the shack for 

138 



the past couple of years. Slie Had 
a brother who was an inmate 
Here, he died last March’. She used 
to visit Him. I don’t know why 
she hung around afterward.” 
“Tell me more about the car. 
Was there anything unusual 
about it? Any bundles on the 
back seat, rug on the floor, any- 
thing at all?” 

“My boys would have caught 
anything like that. Tlie car was 
clean. At the time we had no 
reason to hold the woman.” 
“Where was she going at that 
Hour, in this weather?” 

“She was on Her way to rela- 
tives in the northern part of tlie 
fstate; she was worried about 
flooding.” 

“Where in the northern part 
of the state?” 

“Gainesville, she said.” 

“Get the names of these rela- 
tives?” 

“Well — ” 

“Find out, Brasher. And put 
out a general alert on the car. 
I want it found fast. And when 
it’s found, I want it gone over 
with magnifying glasses: over, in 
and under!” 

“Naturally I’ve alerted the 
State Highway Patrol,” Brasher 
saw. “But frankly, Governor, I 
don’t understand all this empha- 
sis on the car. The woman obvi- 
ously left the house before Grayle 
arrived. He found the house emp- 
ty and broke in — ” 



GALAXY 



“Are there any signs of that?” 
“Well, the locks weren’t brok- 
en. But — ” He broke off, look- 
ing astounded. “By God! It’s 
clear as day! The little bitch 
was in on it! They planned it in 
advance! She was waiting for 
Kim, with the car gassed up and 
ready to go — ” 

“Planned it two and a Half 
years in advance — including tlie 
death of the brother? And I 
thought you said she was alone 
in the car. But never mind. Check 
on the car. Find out where it was 
serviced, what kind of shape it 
was in, whether she had any spe- 
cial work done on it. Talk to her 
friends. Find out if she ever met 
Grayle, ever visited the prison 
after her Husband died. And Cap- 
tain. ...” He held Braslier’s eyes 
with a cold expression. “I'll bet 
you my retirement to your next 
promotion you don’t find a 
tiring.” 

The guard chief returned the 
glare. “I’ll take that bet — sir.” 

/^ihief Engineer Hunnicut, arriv- 
^ ing seven minutes late for 
his scheduled briefing of the offi- 
cials assembled in the office of 
the Regional Director, USPPA, 
looked around at the grim ex- 
pressions lining the long table, 
“I won’t waste your time with 
generalities, gentlemen. You’re 
aware that some difficulties Have 
developed in the first hours of op- 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



eration of the APU station. In es- 
sence, it boils down to a rathetf 
wide discrepancy between rated 
and actual efficiency. This in turn 
suggests a power leakage, which 
at first glance appears preposter- 
ous. A very specialized type of re- 
ceiver is required to draw power 
from the transmission field,” 

“It was our understanding that 
nothing of the sort was possible,” 
a jowly man with a mane of gray 
Hair cut in brusquely. “I recall 
the objections raised in the early 
hearings, and the contemptuous 
way in which those objections 
were put down by you so-called 
technical people. And you have 
the effrontery to stand, up Here 
and tell us power is leaking — 
or being stolen from tlie US gov- 
ernment.” 

“I don’t know who you’ve been 
talking to, Senator,” Hunnicut 
said. “But 1 said nothing what- 
ever about power being stolen. 
I think it would be wise to avoid 
leaping to any conclusions at this 
point — ■ particularly before you 
have heard what I came Here to 
report to you.” 

“Well, it certainly appears ob- 
vious. ...” Tlie senator trailed 
off. 

“It’s far from obvious. This is 
a new technology, gentlemen. 
Even those of us who designed 
and constructed the system don’t 
pretend to know all the answers; 
I think it would behoove others 

139 



witli less knowledge of tGe facts 
to exercise some restraint in the 
ideas tKey spread abroad. Those 
comments may come Home to 
roost.” 

Hunnicut swept the table 
with a challenging look. “Now, as 
to what we’ve turned up — it 
appears that there are at least two 
field discontinuities, other than 
those accounted for by the nine 
receiving stations.” 

“What’s a field discontinuity?” 

“A point of demand on the 
power field creates a distinctive 
fluctuation in the field-strength 
gradient. We’re dealing with what 
might be described as force lines, 
analogous to the force lines of a 
magnetic field. When power is 
drawn, these force lines are bent 
toward the point of demand.” 

“Well — where are these illegal 
receivers? What are you doing 
about them? Whom Have you no- 
tified? Do you intend to allow 
them to simply continue to drain 
off God knows how many thou- 
sands of kilowatts of government 
owned power, and thumb their 
noses at us?” 

“The pin-pointing of these dis- 
continuities is not quite so simple 
as locating an illegal radio trans- 
mitter, for example. It’s necessary 
to take a large number of field 
strength readings, and to plot 
them against the theoretical flux 
density pattern. Again I remind 
you that the state of the art — ” 
140 



tCXXTe’re not here to listen to a 
* ' lecture on art,” the sen- 
ator cut in. “I’ve asked you a 
number of questions, young man, 
and I expect — ” 

“I’m no longer a young man, 
Senator,” Hunnicut broke in. He 
felt his temper breaking at last; 
and it felt damned good. A feel- 
ing almost of exultation filled 
him. Here was a target he could 
Hit. And I Have a sneaking suspi- 
cion these gentlemen didn’t come 
here to listen to your expecta- 
tions. I’m trying to tell you what 
we’ve learned so far. If you’d sit 
still and listen for a few minutes, 
you might find it unnecessary to 
waste time with pointless nee- 
dling. Now as I was saying — ” 
“Look here — ” the senator 
started from his chair, but allow- 
ed his colleagues to pull him back 
and sooth him. 

“ — we’re fairly certain we 
have two points of power loss 
to deal with, one considerably 
more massive than the other. The 
lesser of the two seems to be lo- 
cated quite close to the generat- 
ing station, possibly in the moun- 
tainous area to the north — ” 
“What in the world is up there 
that could be drawing power from 
the net?” a thin, elderly fellow 
whom Hunnicut recognized as a 
State University Board Member 
burst out, then subsided, looking 
embarrassed. 

“We don’t know. We’re pro- 
GALAXY 



ceeding on tfie tHeory tHat it’s a 
purely natural phenomenon.” 
“How is tliat possible the sen- 
ator snorted. ”1 seem to remem- 
ber being told that this entire 
system is a vastly sophisticated 
piece of ultra-modern engineer- 
ing, that the whole theory behind 
it isn’t more than five years old.” 
“Nature knows nothing of our 
theories,” Hunnicut said flatly. 
“The sun was shining long before 
we understood sub-nuclear phys- 
ics, radioactivity was heating the 
earth for five billion years before 
the Curies. It may well be that 
Some type of geological formation 
we know nothing about has the 
characteristic of absorbing energy 
in the broadcast spectrum. That 
theory may or may not be sup- 
ported by the other findings we 
have developed.” 

“No dramatic pauses, if you 
please, Mr. Hunnicut!” the sen- 
ator interjected into the mo- 
mentary silence. 

“I’ll remind you that this is 
tentative, gentlemen,” Hunnicut 
ignored the barb. “But at the mo- 
ment it appears that the second 
demand point coincides with the 
center of the storm that’s ripping 
the East Coast to shreds at the 
moment.” 

“So — what does that mean?” 

C4 A s to that. Senator, your 
guess is as good as mine.” 
“Very well, what’s your guess?” 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“My guess,” Hunnicut said 
slowly, staring the senator down, 
“is that the thing that’s creating 
the whirlpool is drawing its pow- 
er from the Pasmaquoddie Sta- 
tion.” 

There was a burst of exclama- 
tions; the thin voice of the Inte- 
rior Department man won out: 
“You’re saying that someone 
— the Communists, perhaps — 
are using our power system to 
create this storm?” 

“I said nothing about Com- 
munists. But the relationship 
seems indisputable.” 

“Poppycock!” the senator 
barked. “You’re attempting to 
explain away the failure of your 
scheme by conjuring up imagi- 
nary menaces. Russians manipu- 
lating the weather, eh? That’s the 
damnedest piece of nonsense I’ve 
ever heard!” 

“That’s not what I said.” 

“But you implied it!” 

“I implied nothing.” 
“Gentlemen!” Peacem akers 
were on their feet, urging the two 
verbal antagonists to their seats. 
“This wrangling is getting us no- 
where,” an Army colonel said. 
“We’re here to assemble data, 
nothing more. Let’s stick to the 
facts.” 

“The facts are that I’m recom- 
mending that the transmitter be 
shut down immediately, until the 
possible correlation can be check- 
ed out,” Hunnicut said. 



141 



“Preposterous!” the senator 
barked. “That would be a public 
announcement of failure!” 
“Impossible,” the Interior De- 
partment representative said flat- 
ly. “The entire project would be 
discredited by any such shut- 
down — to say nothing of the 
problems it would cause those fa- 
cilities that are now operating on 
the broadcast system.” 

“Very well; you gentlemen can 
act as you see fit. But I’m sub- 
mitting my recommendation in 
writing to the Secretary, person- 
ally.” 

“If you do, Mr. Hunnicut,” the 
senator said, “that will be the 
end of a promising career.” 

“If I don’t,” Hunnicut said, “it 
may be the end of something con- 
siderably more important than 
my career.” 

'T'lie insistent chirrr of the mu- 
ted telephone woke the Presi- 
dent of the United States from a 
restless sleep. He lifted the faintly 
glowing receiver and cleared his 
throat. 

“All right,” He said. 

“Mr. President, General May- 
nard is recommending immediate 
evacuation of the Florida keys. 
Governor Cook has declared a 
state of emergency and requests 
Federal disaster action.” 

“Winds still rising?” 

“Yes sir. Over ninety knots 
now. Record tides along the entire 
142 



South Florida coast. Water and 
wind damage as far north as Hat- 
teras. No signs of any letup, ac- 
cording to Merritt Island.” 

“Tell the general to go ahead 
with the evacuation. Give Him 
full Armed Forces support. I don’t 
envy him tlie chore.” 

“No, sir. I Have one other item. 

I wouldn’t Have bothered you, 
but as long as I already have — • 
an engineer on the PasmaquoddS 
project, a man by the name of 
Hunnicut — ” 

“I remember the name, Jerry.” 
“Yes, sir. He’s submitted a rec- 
ommendation direct to Secretary 
Tyndall, over the heads of his 
direct superiors, to the effect that 
the power broadcast is in some way 
affecting the storm. Making it 
worse, I gather. He’s requesting 
authorization to shut down long 
enough to observe results, if any.” 
“That’s a pretty extreme re- 
quest, Jerry.” 

“Hunnicut is known as a level- 
headed man, sir. And He’s laying 
his job on the line with this ac- 
tion. Still, as you say, it sounds 
fantastic.” 

“Check it out, Jerry. Get some 
other opinion — outside opinions. 
Don’t let Bob Tyndall pressure 
you. Get at the facts. And see 
what impact this shutdown would 
have.” 

“I checked that aspect out, sir. 
THere’d be no particular problem, 
except for Caine Island Prison.

They’re on the broadcast net, 
as you know. And they’ve lost 
their backup capability. The 
winds Have knocked out the over- 
water cable, and their stand-by 
generators have been flooded. 
Without broadcast power they’d 
be in serious trouble.” 

“WHat about evacuation?” 
“Sir, there are twelve hundred 
maximum security prisoners at 
Caine Island.” 

“I see. All right, get on it and 
come back to me with firm rec- 
ommendations by — ” The Pres- 
ident glanced at the glowing dial 
of the bedside clock. “Hell, I 
might as well get up and come 
down to the office. I’m not go- 
ing to get any more sleep to- 
night.” 

HPhe courier boat is hidden in 
the place Lokrien had de- 
scribed, a shallow gorge high in 
the mountains. The smooth green- 
gray curve of the Ul-metal hull 
glows softly in the dark. As Gal - 
grather slides down the slope in 
a clatter of pebbles, the entry 
port, triggered by the field gen- 
erated by the bioprosthetics de- 
vices in his body, opens to ad- 
mit him. Hammer in hand He 
strides along the glare-strip light- 
ed passage to the control com- 
partment. 

“Welcome aboard, Captain- 
Lieutenant," a smooth voice says 
from above him. He goes flat 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



against the wall, his teeth bared. 
He has forgotten that the ships 
of Ysar speak with a man’s voice. 

“Commander Lokrien is not 
aboard at this time," the con- 
struct-vice states. “Kindly make 
yourself comfortable until his re- 
turn. The refreshment cubicle is 
located — ” 

“ Where is he?" 

“I detect that you are agi- 
tated,” the voice says calmly. 
“You are invited to make use of 
a tranquilizing spray.” There is a 
soft click, and a small silver tube 
pops from a dispenser slot beside 
the conn chair. 

Gralgrathor snarls, swings the 
hammer against the plaston pan- 
el. It rebounds harmlessly. 

“Attention!” the voice says 
sharply. “You are ordered to 
withdraw from the control com- 
partment at once! This is an op- 
erational urgent command!" A 
sharp jolt of electricity through 
the floor reinforces the words. 
Gralgrather whirls and runs aft, 
slamming open each door, 
searching every cranny of the 
compact vessel. 

“Where are you hiding, Loki?” 
he shouted. “ Come out and face 
me, and tell me again about the 
needs of the empire!” 

“Captain-Lieutenant, I per- 
ceive that you are in a dangerous- 
ly excited state.” The cybernetic 
voice issues from a speaker in 
the passage. “I must ask you to 

143 



leave the vessel at once.” A low- 
voltage shock throws ham against 
the bulkhead. He turns and 
makes 'his way , stumbling, to the 
power cell chamber door, smash- 
es the lock with a blow. Inside, 
ignoring repeated shocks, he takes 
aim at the massive conductors 
leading up from the coil cham- 
ber, and with all the power of 
his back and arms, brings the 
hammer down on the casing. The 
instantaneous blast that follows 
blows him into scarlet darkness.

I nside tEe big House, Falconer 
usEered the cab driver into a 
big, Kigfi-ceilinged room with tro- 
phy-covered oak walls, a vast 
granite fireplace, deep rags, low, 
comfortable furniture. He poured 
the man a drink at a mahogany- 
topped bar that occupied most of 
one -wall, adjacent to glass doors; 
tHat opened onto a flagstone ter- 
race. 

“I’ll be witli you in about ten 
minutes,” He said, and left tEe 
room, went up tEe wide, curved 
stairway, along tEe Ball to a spa- 
cious bedroom. He donned a 
Heavy cavalry twill shirt, whip- 
cord jodpEurs, low boots. He 
strapped a lightweight Holster un- 
der Eis arm, fitted a flat pistol to 
it, then pulled a dark blue, Navy- 
issue weather- jacket on. 

Zabisky looked around as Fal- 
144 



coner walked into the study. 

“You got some nice pieces here, 
Mister,” Ee said. He pointed a 
blunt forefinger at a tamisEed 
cuirass and a pair of crossed pikes 
over tEe bar. 

“THat looks like tlie old Polish 
armer,” He said. “Sixteen Hun- 
dreds. It took a man to wear 
that stuff all day. I’ll tell you.” 
Falconer nodded. “Indeed it 
did. You’re interested in armory?” 
“Well, you know. A guy’s got 
to Have a Hobby,” Ee said. “You 
got quite a collection Here.” His 
eyes roved over tfie array of 
weapons, plate-armor, mail, tfie 
faded banners and scarred es-< 
cutcEeons. “Hey,” he said, point- 
ed with Eis chin toward a lozenge- 
sHaped shield bearing a design, of 
a two -Headed eagle in dark 
bronze. “WHere’d you get tHat?” 
“At Vienna.” 

“Funny. I got an old beer tank- 
ard at Home, been in the family 
for a long time, got tEe same, pic- 
ture on it. Supposed to belonged 
to my ancestors. The story is, 
we Ead a king in the family,

ways at Falconer. “I guess it’s a 
lot of bull, but my old great- 
aunt Dragica, she’s a nut on gen- 
ealogy, you know; she comes 
up with all this stuff.” 

“Your name was familiar,” 
Falconer said. “You’re a descend- 
ant of king John Sobeiski?” 
“Yeah, that was his name. You 
GALAXY 



Heard of him? Geeze. I’m named 
for Him.” 

“He was a man,” Falconer 
said. “Taller tfian you, big as 
an ox through tKe cfiest and 
shoulders, fair Hair, but eyes mucH 
like yours. He had the gift of 
laughter. He was much beloved 
by his men.” 

Zabisky stared, gave a short 
laugh. “You talk like you knew 
the guy.” 

“I’ve read of him,” Falconer 
said shortly. “Let’s go, John.” 

“Yeah.” Zabisky followed Fal- 
coner outside. In the drive, He 
halted. 

“Hey, Mister. There’s just one 
more thing. 

Falconer turned. Zabisky took 
a quick step toward him, rammed 
a powerful right jab toward Fal- 
coner’s sternum. Falconer turned 
half sideways, caught the wrist, 
bright it forward under his arm, 
levered the elbow backward across 
his chest. 

“Okay. I just wanted to check,” 
Zabisky said. 

They went along a brick walk; 
Falconer lifted one of the five 
doors on the long garage. Zabis- 
ky whistled at the gleaming 
shapes parked in the gloom. 

“A Jag XK120, an SJ Doosie, 
a SSK Mercedes, a Bugatti 41, 
ain’t it? And what’s that. It looks 
like a ’35 Auburn — ” 

“It’s a ’68 Auburn 866. New 
production.”

“Man, you know your cars. 
Which one are we taking?” 
“The Auburn.” 

Zabisky whistled again, run- 
ning a hand along the sleek lines 
of the car. “What’s she got under 
the hood?” 

“A TEunderbird 386 horseoow- 

er V-8.” 

“And I get paid too, Hah? Let’s 
go pal. I want to see how this 
baby turns up.” 

They pulled out along the drive 
Swiftly, noiselessly. At the road, 
Zabisky turned to Falconer. 
“Where to?” 

Falconer pointed. 

“WEat town we headed for?” 
“Just drive, John. I’ll tell you 
when to turn.” Falconer leaned 
back against the smooth leather 
seat and in ten seconds was sound 
asleep.

CCHpEe Highway Patrol found 
the car parked on a side 
street in Brooksville,” Captain 
Brasher said. “Key in the ignition, 
nobody around.” 

“What kind of neighborhood 
was it?” Hardman asked. 

The captain gave a lift of his 
khaki-epauletted shoulders. “Af- 
ter all, I wasn’t there. I can’t 
be expected to know every detail.” 
“That’s just what I do expect, 
Brasher! And I don’t expect to 
wait until morning to find out 
what kind of car Grayle is driving 
now!”

TKe intercom buzzed; the 
governor jabbed tKe button sav- 
agely. 

“Sir, Captain Lacey of tKe 
Highway Patrol on the line for 
Captain BrasHer. Shall I — ” 
“Put Kim on.” He picked up 
tKe pHone, listened to clicks. 

“THis is Hardman at Caine 
Island, Captain,” lie said. “I’ll 
take your report.” 

“Yes, sir. On tKe Rambler: we 
found it in Brooksville.” 

“Yes, I know. Any leads?” 
“Looks like He knocked over 
tHe watcliman at tKe Ford car 
agency. It’s just across tKe street 
from where tKe Rambler was 
parked. He’s still out, but wKen 
Ke comes around Ke can tell us if 
anything’s missing from the lot.” 
“Good. Keep me informed.” 
TKe governor cradled the pKone 
and looked across at Brasher. 
“He took a car from the Ford 
lot Ke was parked beside. We 
don’t know what model or color, 
but we can be pretty sure it’s 
a new one.” He swiveled to look 
at tKe map of the state on the 
wall. “Lacey, I want you to 
watch 1-74 and 1-4, and US 19, 
north and south. Stop any new 
Ford.” 

“TKat’s a pretty tall order.” 
“Still — I’m ordering it!” He 
cradled tKe phone. 

“I want a man on the scene. A 
reliable man, representing my — 
our — interests.” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“Harmon,” BrasKer said at 
once. “He’s keen. A good man.” 
“I thought he was in tKe Hospi- 
tal.” 

“He Has a Headache that gives 
Kim a personal interest in nailing 
Grayle. They’d Had run-ins be- 
fore.” 

“Get Kim up there, rigKt away.” 
WKen BrasKer Had left, tHe 
governor poured Eimself a stiff 
Scotch from His office bar, then 
keyed the intercom and called 
for Lester Pale. TKe man came 
in a few minutes later, looking 
troubled. 

“Anything yet, Lester?” 
“Nothing that makes any 
sense, sir.” 

“Let’s Have it anyway.” 
Lester spread papers on the 
edge of the desk. 

“My Pentagon contact came 
through with a reference to a 
prisoner named Grayle — • ” 
“First name?” 

“Just an initial : T. This Grayle 
was transferred to Ft. Leaven- 
worth from Ft. McNair at Wash- 
ington, after a court-martial con- 
viction for murder.” 

“Any details of the crime?” 
“Yes, sir. The trial transcript 
is attached. It seems Ke was in 
an Army stockade at tKe time of 
the murder.” 

“WKat motive?” 

“It apears Ke knew the victim. 
Other than tKat — ” Lester 
sliook his head. “Frankly, this is 

147 



prefly hard reading. A poor pho- 
tostat to begin with, and cramped 
Handwriting — ” 

“What do you mean, handwrit- 
ing? Don’t you Have a copy of 
the official record?” 

“Yes, sir,” Lester said flatly. 
“But in 1863 there weren’t any 
typewriters.” 

Hardman stared blankly at His 
aide; He reached, plucked the pa- 
pers from the other’s hands, scan- 
ned the sheets. 

“What the devil is this, Lester? 
This is an account of a Civil 
War trial!” 

“Yes, sir. The man named 
Grayle was a Confederate pris- 
oner, And the man he killed was 
a Union officer.” 

“Union officer?” Hardman ech- 
oed. 

“There’s one discrepancy in the 
story, though,” Lester continu- 
ed in a voice that seemed on the 
edge of breaking. “The rumor 
here at Caine Island was that 
Grayle did the job with an axe; 
but according to this, he used a 
hammer.” 

CCT et me get this straight,” the 
guard lieutenant said soft- 
ly. “Are you giving me the kill 
order on this pigeon?” 

“Not at all.” Brash'er’s eyes 
stared through the other man. 
“But if he’s gunned down in a 
fire-fight, with witnesses that He 
fired the first shot. , . , ” 

14 ® 



The lieutenant nodded, touch- 
ed his tongue to his lips. “Yeah,” 
he said. “Now you’re talking, sir. 
Blale and Weinert’ll feel better 
when they hear — ” 

“They’ll hear nothing, damn 
you! Keep this to yourself. But 
be damned sure you’re in at the 
kill, understand?” 

“You bet, Cap’n. The lieuten- 
ant patted the old-fashioned .38 
calibre solid-slug pistol he wore 
at his hip. “I’ll be there!” 

CCT IT/e should leave the main 
* * road,” Grayle said. 

“We can’t,” the girl said deci- 
sively. “Tlie whole road system 
of Florida was built to carry tour- 
ists north and south in a hurry. 
This was unoccupied land just 
a few years ago. There isn’t any 
network of farm roads and sec- 
ondary roads like there is in most 
states.” 

“What about that?” Grayle 
pointed to an exit from the mul- 
ti-laned expressway. 

“It just leads into a town. We 
are making good time.” 

They saw the roadblock then: 
a pair of police cruisers parked 
across two of the four north- 
bound lanes three hundred yards 
ahead, red flashers winking. Anne 
wrenched the wheel hard right, 
with a squeal of tires took the 
exit ramp. 

Grayle looked back. One of the 
police cars was in motion, swing- 

GALAXY 



ing in a tight turn around the 
central divider strip. 

“TKey saw us.” 

Anne hurled the car down out 
and out of the curving ramp, join- 
ed a wide, empty avenue glisten- 
ing under tlie eerie blue glare 
of pole-mounted mercury vapor 
lamps. Above High, concrete-re- 
tained banks, tEe fronts of an- 
cient frame houses stared out 
across tlie traffic chasm like gaunt 
old men facing an open grave. 
A cross street was coming up. 
Anne braked, skidded, caugEt it, 
slammed over tlie curb and across 
tEe apron of a service station, 
missed a parked wrecker by in- 
ches, shot into tEe narrow moutH 
of a side street, sending black wa- 
ter sEeeting. SHe cut tEe headlights, 
slowed to a crawl, pulled into a 
weed-grown driveway, reached 
across to tilt tlie rear-view mirror. 
For a moment, nothing stirred 1 in 
tlie rectangle of glass; then light 
grew, became the glare of high 
beams, probing along tlie dark 
street. The flasher winked as the 
police car came slowly along the 
street. A spotlight beam lanced 
out, pushed Hard shadows across 
the Headliner. The car Halted ten 
feet from the rear bumper of tlie 
Ford. 

“Don’t move.” Grayle gripped 
the right side door handle, twisted 
it silently, Held it. Rain beat on 
the top of the car; faintly, feet 
squelched in mud, coming for- 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



ward along the driver’s side. As 
they halted, Grayle threw the 
door open, sending the man reel- 
ing back and down. He came out 
of the car in a lunge, stooped and 
swept the gun from the Hand of 
the felled policeman, threw it 
from him, flattened himself 
against the side of the car near 
the rear wheel. He looked at the 
angry frightened face staring up 
at him. 

“Tell your partner to throw 
away His gun and come around to 
this side,” he said. 

The man on the ground didn’t 
move, didn’t speak. Rain washed 
pink blood from a cut lip down 
across! his face. 

“Go for His feet, Charlie!” he 
shouted suddenly and threw him- 
self at Grayle in a scrambling 
plunge. A vivid double flash, the 
boom-boom! of a gun, from the 
other side of the car, whining ri- 
cochets. Grayle rounded the back 
of the car, straight-armed the 
man coming from, the opposite 
side, sent him sprawling. He ran 
for the cover of the ragged juni- 
pers lining the drive, plunged 
through as the gun racketed again. 
He ran past the front of the 
house, ripped through a four-foot 
hedge, cut left, was back at the 
curb. One of the men was run- 
ning Heavily down toward the 
police car in the street. Grayle 
sprinted, reached it first had 
the door open when he saw 

I 149 



tiie second policeman grappling 
with! a slim, furiously struggling 
figure beside the Ford. The run- 
ning cop had seen Grayle; he 
skidded to a halt, bringing his 
gun up — 

grayle dived under the flash, 
^ heard the spang! of the solid 
slug against metal behind him as 
He took the man at knee height, 
felt bone break, heard the rag- 
ged scream of the man as He fell 
away. Grayle rolled to his feet, 
ran up the drive. The man by 
the car threw Anne from him; a 
slim, flat needlepump in his hand 
made a harsh, rasping buzz; 
Grayle felt the blow of a fiery 
club against his chest; then He 
was on the man, spinning him, 
throwing the gun away into the 
darkness. He put a thumb hard 
into the base of the policeman’s 
neck, dropped him. He lifted 
Anne, ran to the police car , tossed 
her onto the seat. 

“Can you drive this? 

“Yes,” The engine was idling. 
Grayle slid into the seat and 
closed the door; the car spun 
away from the curb, fishtailed, 
straightened out, its headlights 
burning a tunnel through black- 
ness. Anne looked at Grayle. 

“Are you all right? I thought 
he shot you — ” 

“I’m all right.” 

“He couldn’t Have missed! Not 
at that distance!” 

150 



“Watch the road,” Grayle said 
gently. He put his hand on his 
side; the Heavy prison shirt was 
ripped; under it, hot blood oozed 
from torn hide. Anne’s eyes went 
to his hand. She gasped and the 
car veered. “You’re hurt!” 

“Don’t be concerned about me, 
Anne. We have more immediate 
problems.” 

A voice crackled from the car 
radio: 

“Jig One to Jig nine-two-five, 
(where’s that report, Glance? 
Over.” 

Grayle lifted the microphone 
dangling from a hook at the cen- 
ter of the dash, pressed the key. 

“Jig nine-two-five to Jig One,” 
He said, holding the mike well 
away from his mouth and rough- 
ening his voice. “Busy; call you 
later.” 

“Clance? What was that?” 
The man at the other end called 
twice more, then switched pff 
abruptly. 

“You didn’t fool him,” Anne 
said. “They have directional gear; 
they know where this car is. They 
are tracking us right now.” 

They had turned into a pros- 
perous-looking commercial street. 
Neon and glare signs shone 
through the driving downpour. 
A tall Sabal palm was down 
across the flooded street. The 
wind blew fallen fronds across 
the pavement. There were no 
people in sight, few cars. 

GALAXY 



Grayle picked up the map from 
the front seat, opened it out, stu- 
died the street map on the re- 
verse. 

Ct 'There’s an airfield sEown 
Here, nearby,” Ee said. 
“TEe police and taxi copter port.” 
“Yes?” 

“Turn left ahead. It’s about a 
mile,” 

“You did say ‘Police’?” 

“We need an aircraft. We Eave 
little cEoice.” 

“Grayle, I can’t fly a copter.” 
“PerEaps I can.” 

“But — you can’t drive a car!” 
“I’m not familiar with ground 
.vehicles, but I Eave considerable 
experience as a pilot. Do as I ask, 
Anne. As you said, we have no 
time to waste.” 

Anne laughed with a touch of 
Hysteria, swung into a cross ave- 
nue toward a towering column of 
lights in tlie distance, doing a 
steady forty miles an hour down 
the center of the wide palm-lined 
street. A police car passed them, 
screaming in the opposite direc- 
tion. As they swung around tEe 
periphery of a wide plaza a sec- 
ond police car passed them with- 
out slowing. THe avenue ran 
straight between wide lawns 
crossed by broad walks, punctu- 
ated by illuminated fountains. 
Ahead, the lake was blackness. 
Before a low building on the left, 
there was movement in a court- 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



yard. Another car emerged from 
a ramp and sped away. There 
was a lighted gate ahead. A po- 
liceman in a yellow slicker step- 
ped from the sEed to wave them 
through. Anne gave a gasp tEat 
was half a sob, half laughter. 

“People see what they expect 
to see,” Grayle said. “They don’t 
expect to see us here.” 

There were a dozen or more 
small aircraft in sigHt; three large 
fifty-passenger, cross-town shut- 
tles bearing commercial blazons, 
several smaller civil craft, a big 
police riot Eeli, a number of small, 
fast two-man machines. At the 
far end of the line were a pair 
of squat, winged VTQL craft with 
Army markings. The headlights 
sEone on them in turn as the car 
swung in a wide curve. 

“Pull up there,” Grayle said. 

Anne pulled the car to a stop 
beside the first in line. 

“Good-by, Anne,” Grayle said. 

CtX/ou intend to leave me Eere 
^ to face tEe police alone?” 
Anne asked with a smile that re- 
lieved the words of accusation. 

“Very well. Let’s go.” Grayle 
jumped out, glanced over tEe 
small short-winged machine, then 
swung up beside the canopy; he 
felt over smooth metal, found a 
lever. TEe EatcE opened with a 
soft whirring sound. As Ee slipped 
into the cockpit, Anne pulled her- 
self up, slid gracefully into the 

151 



front seat. Grayle closed the 
hatch’, studied the array of lumi- 
nous dials. He touched a but- 
ton and a cockpit light came 
on. 

Anne turned to look back at 
liim. “Are you sure you can fly 
this?” 

“It shouldn’t be difficult,” He 
replied absently. He touched an- 
other button, and starters chug- 
ged; the short, wide-bladed pro- 
pellers to either side flicked over 
jerkily. There was a burst of va- 
por from one engine; it caught, 
and a moment later the second 
joined in, whining up to speed. 
Grayle found the brake release, 
gave the engines a burst of pow- 
er; the awkward ship rolled for- 
ward on its tricycle gear, rocking 
in the wind. The nose wheel, 
Grayle discovered 1 , was steerable 
by the wheel before him. He 
turned sharply, passing close to 
the guard shack and the fence, 
swinging back out to face the 
wind howling off the lake. Again 
he paused to study the controls. 
One pair of levers ended in blunt 
cones, not unlike the engine na- 
celles and spinners. He grasped 
them and moved them up from 
horizontal to verticle. The na- 
celles obediently rotated. Now 
the propellers spun in a plane 
parallel to the pavement. 

“Grayle — hurry! They’ve seen 
us!” Anne said. He followed the 
direction of her glance, saw men 

152 



coming across from the gate at 
a ran. 

“Fasten your belt,” he called 
over the shrill of the turbines. “I 
suspect this machine is highly 
unstable.” 

He opened the throttles. 

Instantly the craft leaped up- 
ward, nose high, drifting back- 
ward. He righted it; the plane 
hurtled forward, rocking and buf- 
feting in the wind. Lights whip- 
ped past, just beyond the stubby 
wingtip, dropping away. Grayle 
turned the craft, letting the wind 
carry it. The altimeter needle 
moved jerkily around the dial. 
The compass steadied on a 
course of 305. At an airspeed 
of three hundred and fifty and 
a groundspeed fifty knots higher, 
the craft raced toward the north- 
west. 

( CT X/'e’re dealing,” said the 
^ ' Chief Meteorologist, Unit- 
ed States Weather Service, “with 
a cone of air approximately one 
mile in height and having a di- 
ameter of two miles, in rotation at 
the rate of one revolution each 
one hundred and five seconds. 
The rate is increasing slowly on 
a decreasing exponential curve 
and should, for all practical pur- 
poses, stabilize in another thirty 
hours at approximately one 
RPM, giving a peripheral velocity 
of about one hundred and ten 
knots.” 



GALAXY 



“They’re already reporting 
winds in excess of a hundred 
miles an hour all the way from 
West Palm Beach to Boston,” 
one of his audience of high-rank- 
ing government officials compris- 
ing the special Advisory Group 
cut in. 

The weatherman nodded calm- 
ly. “Frictional forces naturally 
influence a large volume of air 
outside the nucleus of the disturb- 
ance. After stabilization, we 
should expect winds of over two 
Hundred miles per hour through- 
out a belt about two hundred 
miles wide adjacent to the dy- 
namic core, falling off at a rate 
of some ten knots for every hun- 
dred miles. At about one thou- 
sand miles from the center, tur- 
bulence causes a disintegration of 
the rotational pattern, creating 
randomly distributed squalls — ” 

“Good God, man! You’re talk- 
ing about a super-hurricane that 
will devastate a quarter of the 
country!” 

The meteorologist pursed His 
lips. “That’s a slight exaggera- 
tion,” he said carefully. “Now, as 
to rainfall, the estimated precip- 
itation for the eastern portion of 
the country is on the order of 
twenty inches per twenty-four 
Hours. I emphasize, that this is 
an average figure — ” 

“Do you realize what you’re 
saying?” another man burst ouf. 
“Twenty inches is more than 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



some of the country gets iri a 
year!” 

“True. We can anticipate ma- 
jor flooding over the entire wa- 
tershed. The problems involved 
in calculating probable runoff 
rates are complicated by our lack 
of experience in dealing with 
volumes of water of this magni- 
tude, but it seems plain that the 
entire continental drainage pat- 
tern will be overloaded, result- 
ing in some rather interesting 
erosional dynamics. For exam- 
ple — ” 

Just a minute,” a congressmen 
interrupted. “Just how long is 
this rain supposed to continue?” 

For the first time the weather- 
man looked faintly troubled. “In- 
sofar as we’ve been able to cal- 
culate on the basis of limited 
data,” he said, “there’s no con- 
tra-indication for indefinite 
continuation of the present pat- 
tern.” 

“What does that mean?” some- 
one demanded. 

“It means,” the congressman 
interpreted, “that as far as they 
can tell, it’s going to keep on 
raining forever.” 

“That’s ridiculous,” a cabinet 
member said. “A storm draws its 
power from the released heat of 
evaporation; there’s a definite 
limit to the size any weather dis- 
turbance can grow to. I should 
think it would be a relatively sim- 
ple matter to calculate the theo- 

153 



retical limit, based on known 
factors of incident sunligKt and so 
on.” 



4 {"KTormally, tKat would be 
' true, Mr. Secretary. But 
the tKeory doesn’t seem to apply 
in this case. You’re aware that 
there seems to be an anomalous 
situation as regards displacement 
of sea water: the flow into the 
area of the whirlpool appears to 
be balanced by no correspond- 
ing outflow, even at great depth. 
The same is true of air volumes. 
It also seems to apply to the 
energy balance.” 

“Translation, please?” a pep- 
pery man spoke up. 

“Easy, Homer,” the congress- 
man said. “Water and air are go- 
ing in and none is coming out. 
And the energy being expended 
by the storm exceeds that avail- 
able from all known sources. 
Right, sir?” 

TKe weatherman looked 
pleased. “Quite correct.” 

“So — what are we doing about 
it?” 



TKe meteorologist’s expression 
changed to one of mild surprise. 

“Doing?” he echoed. He shook 
his head. “One doesn’t ‘do’ any- 
thing about weather, Congress- 
man. One simply observes it!” 
“For God’s sake, man!” A well- 
braided naval man spoke up. 
“You don’t mean to tell us that 
we’re going to just sit Here and 



154 



watch the country blow away — 
if it doesn’t wash away first!” 
“It’s the function of my de- 
partment to report the weather. 
Admiral, not to control it.” 

For several minutes the room 
was filled with emotional voices* 
all talking at once. The congress- 
man rose and pounded the table 
for order. 

“This is getting us nowhere, 
gentlemen,” he said. “Wh'at about 
it, sir?” Ke addressed the meteor- 
ologist and 1 his aides. “Is there 
any action — any measure at all 
— which you gentlemen can rec- 
ommend? Seeding? Nuclear dissi- 
pation? Anything at all?” 

TKe weathermen were shaking 
their Heads before the question 
was out. There was a moment of 
silence. 

“I heard something,” an Interi- 
or Department spokesman said 
hesitantly. “Probably just a crank 
notion.” 

“Well?” 

“One of our engineers — Hun- 
nicut is his name, I believe — 
Has suggested that the storm is 
tied in with the APU power 
broadcast. He claims that He’s 
pinpointed a massive power drain 
right on top of the storm center. 
As a matter of fact, he submitted 
a proposal direct to the White 
House that the system be shut 
down.” 

“Well!” the congressman bark- 
ed. “Maybe he’s on to something. 

GALAXY 



Let’s check it out. God knows tlie 
time Has come to grasp at straws. 

“Well, an idea like that — ” 
THe Interior man spread his hands, 
“It can hardly be taken serious- 
ly.” 

“There’s only one way to check 
it out,” a White House spokesman 
said. “That’s to shut down the 
System. And we can’t do that.” 
He outlined tlie situation as it af- 
fected the Caine Island Prison. 

“So — the prisoners riot in the 
dark. I think we can survive 
that.” 

“There’s more to it than that!” 
“I know — the reputations of 
the visionaries who poured ten 
billions of Federal funds into the 
power-from-the-air scheme. But 
they’ll just have to suffer, as I 
see it. I say shut down and ob- 
serve tlie results.” 

“Congressman, that will take 
an executive order.” 

“Then let’s get it.” 

There was a general mutter of 
agreement. The Interior man left 
hastily, shaking his head. The 
cabinet member buttonholed the 
congressman. 

“This is all very well, Herb,” 
he said in a low tone. “But what 
if the idea’s as silly as it sounds? 
What do we do then?” 

The congressman patted the 
air. “Let’s worry about that when 
we get to it, eh, Homer? Right 
now we’d better go see the Presi- 
dent” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



JT oktien comes up across the 
rocks, halts before the fire- 
blackened entry of the ship, from 
which a wisp of smoke drifts past 
his head. 

“Xix — what happened here?” 

“A sabotage by a Fleet officer,” 
the ship’s voice says. It sounds 
weak and thin. 

“ Fleet officer?” Lokrien looks 
out across the dark jumble of 
rock. “Thor — are you out there?” 
he calls. 

There is no answer. 

“I went out to look for you,” 
Lokrien shouts into the darkness. 
When I returned, your people 
attacked me like a pack of wild 
krill. Without the Y -field I’d have 
been killed.” 

A vague shape 'moves in the 
darkness. It is Gralgrathor, al- 
most unrecognizable with half the 
hair burned from his head, his 
face blistered, his garments hang- 
ing in charted tags. 

“ Thor 1 What in the name of 
the Nine Gods — ” 

Gralgrathor leaps, swinging his 
hammer. Lokrien jumps back, 
avoiding the clumsy blow. 

“Thor — have you gone mad?” 

Gralgrathor snarls and moves 
to the attack. Lokrien avoids his 
rush, watches him fall. 

The voice of the ship, faint and 
unnoticed, s peaks across the dark- 
ness: “ . fir s damage to lift 
coil chamber. Assault capability: 
negative. Defensive capability: 

155 



minimal. Power reserve level : 
critical. Category One emergency 
measures are no win eiiect. Cap- 
tain-Lieutenant Gralgrattior is 
identified as the saboteur. ...” 
You’ve wrecked my ship!” 
Lokrien cries. “Why? For the love 
of Ysar, why? Did you have to 
drag me down into your exile 
too?” 

But Gralgrathor makes no an- 
swer. He struggles to rise, falls 
back. 

“ Attention , Commander!” the 
voice of the ship echoes across 
the tumbled granite, among the 
trees. “I will execute the traitor for 
his crime against the White 
Fleet!” 

“No!” Lokrien approached 
Gralgrathor. “There has to be a 
reason, an explanation,” he 
pleads. “Tell me, Thor!” 

Gralgrathor sways, on hands 
and knees. Red hate looks out of 
his eyes. 

“ Fll kill you,” he snarls. “Be- 
fore I die, Fll kill you.” 

“Commander,” the ship calls. 
Men approach!” 

“Your mob,” Lokrien says to 
Gralgrathor. “The same crew you 
set on me before!” 

“I will deal with them, Com- 
mander,” says the ship. 

“Thor, go down to meet them. 
Stop them, if you want to save 
their lives. Xix will kill anyone 
who comes close.” 

In silence, Gralgrathor climbs 
156 



to his feet. Lokrien watches as he 
moves off like a crushed insect 
to disappear among the trees w 
Then he turns to the ship. 

“Xix,” he says in a broken 
voice. “What will we do?” 

“We will survive, Commander,” 
Xix says. And one day we will 
right the wrong that was done to 
us this night.” 

VIII 

CC'T'his item you asked for an 
-®- analog check on, Governor 
Hardman,” the FBI Data Tech- 
nician said hesitantly on the gray- 
line phone. “I’m afraid I Haven’t 
come up with anything signifi- 
cant. I’ve made runs keyed to ev- 
ery variable in tlie profile just as 
you asked, but I can’t tie it to 
anything in the Main File.” 
“Damnit, man, here’s a pris- 
oner with no record of trial and 
sentencing — nothing but the 
mere fact of his presence Here as 
evidence of any crime! TEere’s 
got to be an explanation!” 
“You’ve apprehended him?” 
tKe FBI man asked quickly. 

“No, and tfie way it looks now, 
I’m not likely to! And if He is 
picked up, wfiat tEe devil grounds 
do I Have for Holding Him? I 
don’t even know wHat He’s sup- 
posed to Eave done, except by 
rumor!” 

“It’s a weirdie, all rigEt, Gov- 
ernor. I’d like to Help you. If 

GALAXY 



you could give me some idea vvKat 
it is I’m looking for — - ” 

“I don’t know! Tfiat’s why I 
asked for tfie complete analysis 
on tEe few facts I Have on tEe 
man, In Hope you’d turn up some- 
thing. I need a clue, a footEold. 
Damnif, in tEfs day and age a 
man can’t Have lived a lifetime 
without leaving some record, 
some trace, somewHere!” 

“Well, after all, Governor, if 
He’s been in prison for over thir- 
ty years — - ” 

“Nonsense! It’s a case of mis- 
taken identity. Grayle’s no more 
than, forty years old at the abso- 
lute maximum. But even if He 
were fifty, that would still make 
him a Federal convict at fifteen! 
It’s nonsense!” 

“Governor . there is one little 
datum that popped up. Nothing, 
of course, but I may as well men- 
tion it . ” 

“Well?” 

The technician gave a self-con- 
scious laugK. “THe tie-in, I’m 
sorry to say, is more apparent 
than real. You recall the confu- 
sion witH the Civil War trial rec- 
ord linked to your man? I fed 
that in with the rest — and the 
computer cross-referred to an 
item that came in just about three 
Hours ago. It seems that a doctor 
out In St. Louis reported remov- 
ing a bullet from, a man’s abdo- 
men last nigfit. The bullet was 
identified as something called a 
153 



Minie ball, a type of solid shot 
used by the Army in the 1860’s. 
In other words, during the Civil 
War.” 

Hardman made a rasping noise 
of pure frustration. “Civil War 
my left elbow! What is tHis, Ta- 
tum, some kind of In-group 
joke?” 

“The computer is very literal- 
minded, Governor.” 

“Any description of this cEap 
in St. Louis?” 

“Yes, I Have it Here . six- 
tfiree, two-ten, blue eyes,, gray 
Hair, reddisH stubble, well set 
up and extremely scarred — - or 
rather there seems to be a little 
uncertainty about tfiat last item. 
TEe doctor reported that wHert 
He first examined the patient, 
the man exhibited a number of 
prominent scars on, tfie face, neck, 
back, cHest, anus — all over, vir- 
tually. But an Hour later, tfie 
scars were gone. Curious, eK?” 

Hardman was gripping tfie tele- 
phone Hard. “Where is tHis man 
now?” 

“That we don’t know.” 

“Tatum, you know people. Can 
you put out a pickup order on 
this man to tfie St. Louis police? 
'Quietly? And preferably anon- 
ymously.” 

“You see a connection?” 

Hardman laugfied shortly. 
“Grayle is over six feet, gray- 
Haired, redbearded. He’s reported 
to Have shattered a pair of 

GALAXY 



chrome-steel come-alongs witli 
His bare hands, and He tore tire 
locking bars off an armored car 
— also bare-Handed. Either that, 
or He was carrying a three-quar- 
ter-ton jack-H'ammer under his 
shirt. Now we have another big, 
gray-haired fellow out in St. 
Louis whose scars miraculously 
heal in an hour. He was carrying 
a Civil War bullet. Grayle’s link- 
ed to a Civil War killing. Certain- 
ly I see a connection; they’re 
both impossible!” 

“I see what you mean, Gover- 
nor. I’ll get right on it.” 



A t the upper Pasmaquoddie 
Power Station, Chief Engineer 
Hunnicut paced his spacious, air- 
conditioned, indirectly lit, sound- 
proofed, gray-nylon-carpeted of- 
fice. Beyond the wide thermopane 
windows the storm raged unabat- 
ed. In fact, it seemed to Hunni- 
cut, it Had gained in ferocity in 
the last Hour. 

He paused' at his desk — wide, 
highly polished, genuine mahog- 
any — and flipped up the inter- 
com key. 

“Sam, how about that refine- 
ment on those loci?” His voice 
was brittle with strain. 

“I was just going to call you, 
Mr. Hunnicut. Something odd 
Here. The smaller one is tricky, 
very faint, but we’ve narrowed it 
down to a point in the mountains 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



just north of here. Within ten 
miles, possibly. The big one is 
pulling a lot of power, and we 
were able to cut it closer. It’s 
about twenty miles — give or 
take five miles — off the west 
shore of Somerset Island, dead on 
the reported position of the storm 
center.” 

“Sam, what are the chances of 
an error in that placement?” 

“Well, I talked to a buddy of 
mine at Weather in Washington 
about half an Hour ago. He con- 
firmed the plot on the whirlpool 
and swore it was accurate to in- 
ches. It hasn’t moved since it was 
first spotted last evening. As for 
our fix — I’ll stake my job on it. 
I said within five miles, but off 
the record I think we’re within 
a mile. Kind of funny, eh, Mr. 
Hunnicut? What do you think — ” 

“Stand by in the main genera- 
tor room, Sam. I’m coming 
down.” 

He pressed another key, spoke 
briskly to his secretary: “Myra, 
go ahead with the calls I taped 
earlier.” He flipped off the set 
and left the office. In the corri- 
dor, the deep-bellied thrumming 
of tlie big generators buried in 
the rock below vibrated in the 
air, penetrating to the bones. It 
grew louder as he rode the lift 
down, passed through the inter- 
vening doors, became a solid 
tiling as he entered the High, wide 
chamber almost filled by the big 

159 



machines. Sam Webb was over by 
tfie big board, looking concerned- 
ly at tfie rows of tfiree-incfi dial 
faces. He turned as Hunnicut 
came up beside Him. 

“Tfie curves are still upward,” 
fie said. “Leveling in about twen- 
ty-four Hours, I’d guess. By tfiat 
time, tfie big baby off Bermuda 
is going to be pulling a wfiale of 
a lot of power, Mr. Hunnicut.” 
“It would be, if we waited tfiat 
long,” Hunnicut said. 

Webb frowned questioningly. 
“We could sfiut down, Sam. 
We can use regular emergency 
procedures: sfiunt what we can 
into tfie Northeast Distribution 
Net and bleed tfie rest into tfie 
Erie Storage Facility. Wfiat tfiat 
won’t Handle we can spread out 
over tfie Net links, let Central 
and Southeast Handle it.” 

“Mr. Hunnicut — ■ it’s none of 
my business — you’re tfie boss 
■ — but Gave you got an okay from 
fiigfier up on tfiis?” 

“Don’t worry, Sam. I’ll take 
full responsibility for any or- 
ders I give.” 

^Ipfie counterman at tfie all- 
-*■ night beanery waited until 
tfie quiet man in tfie gray slicker 
Had seated Himself and looked 
over tfie menu cfialked on tfie 
dusty blackboard above tfie back- 
bar before fie lowered tfie news- 
paper and sauntered over. He 
shifted tfie broomstraw to tfie 
160 



otfier corner of fiis wide moutfi. 

“Yeafi?” fie inquired. 

“A man,” tfie customer said. 
“Six-tfiree, gray Hair, blue eyes, 
Husky build. Possibly scars on 
His face. Wearing a gray single- 
breasted suit witfi dirty cuffs. 
Seen Him?” 

Tfie counterman’s Head jerked. 
He spat out tfie straw. “Wfio, me? 
I ain’t seen nobody.” He grabbed 
a yellowisfi rag from under tfie 
counter and began wiping tfie 
cliipped formica. 

“Business is slow, efi?” 

“Yeafi.” 

“But not tfiat slow. He was seen 
coming in Here.” Tfie man in 
gray slipped a leather folder from 
an inside pocket and flipped it 
open to expose a small gold 
badge. 

“I ain’t seen nobody witfi no 
scars,” tfie counterman said. “I 
don’t care wfiat some clown says 
fie seen.” 

“Wfiat Have you seen?” 

The man lifted fiis bony shoul- 
ders. “Couple Eackies.” He paused. 

“Go on.” 

“There was a mug witfi gray 
Eair. You know, premature like. 
Big bimbo. But a kid, young, no 
scars on Him; Kell, Ke prob’ly 
don’t even shave.” 

“Wfien was Ke in?” 

“A couple hours ago. Hell, Kow 
do I know?” 

“Any idea wfiere fie was going 
wfien fie left Here?”

“What do you think I am, an 
information bureau? I don’t know 
tiie guy, never seen him before. 
I’m gonna ask him where he 
goes next?” 

“Answer the question.” 

“No, I don’t know where he 
was going.” 

“He left on foot, or he had a 
car waiting?” 

“He . didn’t Have no car.” 
The man in gray smiled gently. 
“You sure about that?” 

“Maybe he picked up a Hackie 
Here. Yeah, I remember now. He 
come in here to tap a hackie 
eating here. Tried to start trouble. 
I hadda throw the both of ’em 
out.” 

“Where did He want to go?” 
“New Jersey, I guess. He said 
something about Princeton.” 

The man in gray nodded and 
stood. 

“Thanks very much, Mr. 
Schutz” he said. He paused at the 
door and glanced back. “By the 
way — the business with the 
blackboard is cute, but I think 
you’d better close your book 
down. The cops are on to it.” 
The counterman’s look follow- 
ed him as he turned up his collar 
and stepped back out into the 
driving rain. 

6 i Tt’s certainly worth a try, Mr. 

■“■President,” Congressman Do- 
berman said solemnly. “The Caine 
Island aspect of the thing is un- 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



fortunate, but in light of the 
situation — ” 

“If there’s a legitimate tecfini- 
cal basis for the decision to shut 
down the power broadcast, I’ll do 
it, Herbert. WHat I’m question- 
ing is the soundness of the pro- 
posal.” The President looked at 
his special assistant. “What about 
it, Jerry?” 

“Sir, Hunnicut himself is the 
leading authority in the field of 
broadcast power. The technical 
people I’ve coordinated with' are 
all either students of his or his 
former teachers. All of them have 
the greatest respect for his judg- 
ment.” 

“Now, just a minute, Jerry,” 
Secretary Tyndall cut in. “I have 
a few scientists of my own, I’ll 
remind you. On my staff, that 
is — ” 

“What do they advise, Bob?” 
the President put in smoothly. 

“They assure me that the idea 
is fantastic, Mr. President! A 
piece of hysteria, pure and sim- 
ple! I’m not saying this scheme 
was set in motion by anti-trans- 
mission forces, mind you, but if it 
had been, it couldn’t have been 
better planned to undermine Con- 
gressional confidence in the fu- 
ture of broadcast power!” 

“All right, Bob, I understand 
your problem. You can set your 
mind at rest. No one’s going to 
blame you.” 

“It’s more than that, Mr. Pres- 

161 



Ident,” Doberman said. “It’s not 
face-saving I’m concerned about 
mow — not entirely, at least. A 
thing like this can be the straw 
that knocks the program out for 
twenty years. We can’t afford 
that. We need APU.” 

“All right, Bob, I believe you. 
And I trust you’ll believe me 
when I say I’m with you. But at 
the moment we’re facing a grave 
situation. If we Have the power 
to avert disaster, there’s no ques- 
tion that we must do so.” 

The secretary nodded reluctant- 
ly. 

“Very well, Jerry. Don’t both- 
er with channels. Get the pow- 
er station on the line, direct.” 
The aide spoke quietly into 
the grayline phone. The others 
waited in silence. 

“Mr. Hunnicut? This is the 
White House calling. Yes, 
the White House — Mr. Hunni- 
cut, personally, please. ” 
Jerry paused listening. His eye- 
brows went up. 

“One moment,” he cut in sharp- 
ly. “Who is this speaking, please? 
Mr. Webb? Mr. Webb, I’m call- 
ing for the President. You are — - 
please don’t interrupt, Mr. Webb 
— you are instructed to shut 
down power broadcast immedi- 
ately, until further notice. I 
repeat, you are instructed to shut 
down at once. This will be con- 
firmed by TWX immediately. 
That’s correct, Mr. Webb. Thank 
162 



you.” Jerry cradled the phone. 
The President was looking at him 
questioningly. 

“Power is off, Mr. President,” 
Jerry said, looking uncomfortable. 

The, President nodded. “That’s 
done, then, gentlemen. Thank 
you for coming over. Please keep; 
me closely informed of any re- 
sults — and Bob, I’d appreciate 
it if you’d speak to Ray Cook 
personally, offer any assistance 
we can give. I suppose it’s possi- 
ble to get some sort of portable 
power in to Caine Island.” 

After the others had left, the 
President looked at his aide with 
a faint smile. 

“Mr. Hunnicut was a mite im- 
patient, was He, Jerry?” 

“His deputy was trying to tell 
me something, Mr. President,” 
Jerry said, looking his chief in 
the eye. “I didn’t catch wliat it 
was.” 

The President nodded. “You’re 
a good man, Jerry,” He said. 

“You’re a good man yourself, 
Mr. President.” 

CCT got through to the White 
House, all right, Mr. Hun- 
nicut,” Sam Webb said. “Or rath- 
er — ” He shook his Head, but 
the dumb-founded expression re-< 
mained on his face. “They got 
through to me. It was a Presi- 
dential order to pull the transmit- 
ters off the line.” 

Hunnicut smiled slightly, hig 
GALAXY 



eyes on the panel before Him. The 
sound of tHe generators Had 
changed; distantly, Heavy relays 
could He Heard, slamming closed. 
Needles nodded and wavered on 
the big dials. Hunnicut’s smile 
faded, was replaced by a frown. 
A side door burst open, and si- 
multaneously tHe telepKone clang- 
ed HarsEly. 

“Mr. Hunnicut! Big trouble! 
TKe transmitters Have switched 
themselves back on again! TKe 
wHole relay bank Has gone nuts! 
Circuits are welding themselves, 
fuses are arcing over — ” 

Webb grabbed up tHe pHone. 
“Yes — all right, we know about 
it, we’re on tHe way!”" He slam- 
med tHe instrument down, at a 
run followed tHe otliers from the 
room. 

Ten minutes of frenzied effort 
by a dozen engineers yielded no 
result. Power continued to pour 
from the generators into the giant 
transmitting coils. 

“Look at this,” a man called 
from a repeater board. “We’re 
Still being drawn on for a full 
load — but only two stations are 
drawing power.” His voice fal- 
tered. “And those two are . , . 
are. ...” 

“I don’t get it, Joe! Wliat tfie 
Hell does! it mean?” 

“Simple,” Hunnicut answered. 
“The outlaw demand points are

output, now. And they’re going

’Ayl'ax Wiston, number P978675- 
-*-*-*- 45, who Had three weeks be- 
fore completed tfie first decade 
of a life sentence to Caine Island 
for rape and murder, was sitting 
on His bunk in cell 911-m-14 
wEen tfie lights went out. At the 
same instant, tfie music of Happy 
Dan and fiis Radio Folks faded; 
the soft Hiss of air from the ven- 
tilator died into silence. 

For all of ten seconds, Max sat 
unmoving, eyes wide open against 
the darkness, ears straining for 
a sound. Tfien a yell sounded 
from somewhere nearby: 

“Hey, what’s with tfie lights? I’m 
tryn’a read!” The next instant, 
a bedlam of calls and yells had 
broken out. Max rose and groped 
across tfie cell, hands outstretch- 
ed. He put His face against tfie 
bars; no faintest glimmer of ligfit 
was visible anywhere. Tfiere were 
screams mingled with tfie yells 
now; to a latent claustropliobe, 
the total absence of fight could be 
as confining as a tomb'. • 

Max stood by tfie cell door, 
liis mind racing. He Had known 
from tfie moment that tfie sen- 
tence was pronounced on him 
that he would never spend tHe 
rest of His fife in prison. He was

would regain the life that the 
slut had taken away from him. In 
the meantime, He would go along 
quietly, pretend to accept His fate 
— and wait. And one day His 
cKamce would come. 

And now it Had. He knew it. 
He could smell it in the air. All 
He had to do was think, make 
the right moves, not panic, not 
louse it up. Think. Think, Max. 

Lights off, air off, radio off. 
Okay. No power. There was a 
storm, lines were down. But 
there was something about 
Switching to a new system, broad- 
cast power. Maybe that was it. 
It hadn’t worked out, new stuff 
iwas always developing kinks. So 
all right, the details didn’t matter, 
the point was — no power. Mean- 
ing no alarm bells, no intruder 
Circuits, no timed locks on the 
cefi-block interlock. 

A dazzling thought entered 
Max’s head. Gingerly, delicately, 
He reached through the bars, felt 
along die cold metal for the out- 
er manual latch. Gently, he 
grasped it; carefully, he turned it. 

The door swung open. 

Foe a moment, Max stood in 
She darkness, smiling. Then he 
stepped out, paused to orient him- 
self, and started toward the guard 
post at the end of the passage. 

tiHphat’s right,” the service 
station attendant said. 
“Same car; you wouldn't forget 

3«4 



that one in a hurry. Two men ini 
it; the driver was a rough-looking 
character, flat nose, bullet-head- 
ed, you know. Had on a yellow 
and brown mackinaw. The other 
guy . well, I don’t know. He 
was asleep; didn’t say any- 
thing. What I figured, he own- 
ed the car, and this other guy 
was his chauffeur — only He 
didn’t look much like my idea 
of a chauffeur. Maybe — hey! 
Maybe the guy stuck him up, 
took his car. Maybe the guy. .” 
The attendant swallowed. “Maybe 
the guy was dead!” 

“If he were dead,” the man in 
the tan car inquired, “why would 
the murderer carry him around 
with him?” 

“Yeah', it don’t make sense. 
Anyway, now I remember the guy 
said something.” The attendant 
sounded disappointed. “Just as 
they were pulling out.” 

“Do you remember what he 
said?” 

The man lifted his cap to 
scratch his head. “Something 
about, “We’re getting close. Steer 
a little more to the east. ’ 
Something like that.” 

“And this was how long ago?” 
“Heck, not more’n fifteen, 
twenty minutes.” 

“Thanks.” The man in the tan 
car pulled away from the pumps. 
As He accelerated to join the fast 
lane, He was speaking urgently 
into a microphone. 



GALAXY 



W lien Falconer woke again, 
the big car was bumping 
over a rough-surfaced road'. TKe 
wind was still beating at tHe car, 
but tlie rain Had slackened per- 
ceptibly. He sat up, alert. 
“Wfiere are we, JoEn?” 

“West of St. Paul a few miles,” 
Zabisky said. “I bad to get off 
tbe interstate?” 

“Wliy?” 

“You said to steer east. What 
am I going to do, cut out cross- 
country?” 

Falconer nodded. “I’m Hun- 
gry,” lie said. “Stop at tHe first 
eating place you see, JoEn.” 
“Geeze, you can sure pack it in, 
brother! Sleep and eat, tHat all 
you do, fer Chrissakes?” 

“I’m making up for lost time, 
Jolin. I’ve been off my feed, you 
might say.” 

“There ain’t no eating joints 
along here. Cripes, the lousy road 
ain’t even maintained. I ain’t 
seen a House for ten miles. And 
this lousy rain ain’t Helping any.” 
Zabisky Hunched over the 
wheel staring out into tHe rain, 
sweeping in almost Horizontal 
gusts across the road. “Anyways 
there ain’t mucH traffic. Most 
people got better sense, in tEis 
weather.” 

Falconer glanced at tHe outside 
mounted rear-view mirror, saw 
a flash of lights, far back. 

“How long Has that car been 
behind us?” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



TKe driver looked up at Kis 
mirror. “Geeze, it beats me. I 
ain’t seen Him.” 

Two miles farther, tHe car be- 
hind Had closed the gap to Half 
a mile. 

“Speed up a little,” Falconer 
said. 

“Hey,” Zabisky said. “Is tHat 
guy tailing us, or wEat?” He look- 
ed sideways at His employer. 
“WKat is this caper, anyway, 
Mister? I told you I don’t want 
to get mixed in nothing sfiady.” 
“We’re doing nothing illegal, 
John. See if you can gain on 
Kim.” 

“I’m doing all I can, fer CEris- 
sakes! Fifty in tEis soup is like 
a Hundred and ten!” 

“He seems to be bettering tHat.” 
Zabisky swore and accelerated. 
The low-slung car veered from 
side to side of tHe single-lane 
road, bucking the squall winds. 
Rounding a turn, it broke away, 
went into a tail-wagging slide 
before the driver wrencEed it 
back info the center of the road. 

“Ha! Our pal back there don’t 
like tlie pace,” He said. His spir- 
its seemed to be rising under 
stress. The Auburn roared ahead 
on a long straightaway. The 
speedometer needle reacEed sixty, 
crept toward seventy. Belatedly, 
tHe Headlights of the car behind 
them appeared around the bend. 

“OH-oh,” Zabisky said, watch- 
ing in the mirror. “He’s trying to 

165 



straighten out the curve!” The 
following lights veered suddenly, 
swept across the treetops and 
went out. 

C & XT e bought it,” Zabisky said. 

“Scratch one tail.” 

“We’ll have to go back,” Fal- 
coner said. 

“Hah? I thought — ” 
“Somebody may be bleeding to 
death, John.” 

Zabisky brought the car to a 
halt 

“Who were they, anyway? 
Cops?” he asked. 

“I don’t know, John.” 

“Why they tailing us?” 

“I don’t know that, either.” 
For a smart guy there’s a lot 
you don’t know.” 

“Nevertheless, I’m telling you 
the truth. Let’s get moving, 
John.” 

Muttering Zabisky backed, 
turned, drove along the narrow 
road at thirty. The headlights 
showed up a tan-colored car up- 
side down in the drainage ditch. 
The front wheels were still spin- 
ning slowly. 

“Flipped neat,” Zabisky said, 
pulling over so as to illuminate 
the wreck with his headlights. 
Falconer opened the door and 
stepped out into the gusting rain, 
went across the strip of sodden 
turf to the car. It rested on its 
top in a foot of muddy, swirling 
water. Inside it a man was slump- 
166 



ed against the cracked glass of the 
windshield like a bundle of old 
clothing. His face was half under 
water. 

“Cripes, the poor boob’ll 
drown,” Zabisky shouted over the 
drumming of the storm. Falconer 
stepped down into the water and 
tried the door Handle. It was 
jammed tight. He twisted harder. 
The metal yielded, broke with 1 a 
sharp sound. 

“Jeeze, the cheap metal they 
use these days,” Zazbisky said. 
He splashed around the front of 
the car. 

“We got troubles,” he called. 
“She’s tight against the bank. 
This door ain’t opening no matter 
what!” 

Falconer felt along the edge 
of the door. It was sprung suffi- 
ciently to allow him to insert his 
fingertips under it. He pulled 
gently. The double metal flange 
folded back without budging the 
door. 

“Hey, that guy inside ain’t go- 
ing to last much longer,” Zabis- 
ky called. “That water’s coming 
up fast!” Maybe we can bust out 
the windshield — but I’d hate to 
see the mug’s face after we fin- 
ish.” 

Falconer went to one knee, 
exploring the edge of the door 
low water level. It was twisted 
in the frame, exposing one cor- 
ner. He thrust a finger through, 
levered the door outward far 

GALAXY 



enougK to get a two-handed grip. 
He braced his feet and pulled. 
The metal bent slowly, then fold- 
ed back before springing open. 
Falconer reached inside, eased the 
injured man out onto the muddy 
bank. He was breathing noisily 
through his mouth’. Water ran 
from his nose. He coughed, then 
breathed easier. Except for a 
swelling on his forehead, he seem- 
ed to be uninjured. 

As Falconer stood, he caught 
sight of Zabisky’s face. The swar- 
thy skin looked yellowish in the 
harsh beam of the headlights, the 
stubble on the big chin stood out 
like grease paint. He was shaking 
his Head in emphatic denial. 

“I never seen nothing like that,” 
he said, staring at the ruined door. 
The latch dangled from the torn 
metal of the jamb. “I seen strong 
guys, but nothing like that. What 
are you, Mister?” His eyes met 
Falconer’s. 

“I’m a mart with strong Hands, 
John. That’s all.” 

“Uh-uh,” Zabisky said. “No- 
body’s got hands like that — ” 
He broke off as shadows moved. 
He whirled, almost losing his bal- 
ance on the slippery slope. A- car 
was approaching from the south. 

F alconer went flat against the 
bank. The oncoming car 
slowed, Halted twenty feet away. 
A spotlight speared out to high- 
light Zabisky. 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“Hold it right there,” a voice 
called. Doors opened and slam- 
med. Two men came forward, 
bulky in shiny rain gear. Zabisky 
stood with his hands held clear 
of his sides, not moving, watching 
them. One Halted ten feet away, 
holding a Heavy pistol trained on 
the driver’s chest. The other came 
up from the side, reached under 
the mackinaw to frisk the man. 

“Hell, this ain’t the guy,” the 
man with the gun said. Light 
winked on the badge of his cap. 

The other man was looking at 
the overturned car. “What hap- 
pened?” 

“He spun out,” Zabisky said. 
“The damn fool tried to take the 
curve at seventy — in this soup!” 
“Yeah? Where do you tie in?” 
“I come back to see to the guy.” 
The man who had searched him 
pushed him, staggering him. “I like 
it better you ambushed Him. 
What did you do, shoot out a 
tire? Or feed liim a pill through 
th'e windshield?” 

“Where’s your partner?” the 
other man said. “Talk it up, 
Hunky. We don’t like cop-killers 
a lot, even Federal cop killers.” 
“He ain’t dead!” Zabisky start- 
ed and was cut off by a short, 
powerful right jab to the midriff. 
He bent over, Hugging Himself. 

“How do you like that, Roy, a 
glass gut,” the cop with the gun 
said. 

“He’s laid out over there,” Za- 

167 



bisky grunted, forcing Himself up- 
right. 

The unarmed cop went over, 
looked down at the man lying on 
the shoulder. 

“He’s breathing,” Ke called. He 
came back to stand before Zabis- 
ky. “WHy’d you pull him out?” 

Zabisky squared his shoulders. 
He stared into the light at the 
shadowed face of the policeman. 

“Go knit a sweater, copper,” 
Ee said. This time, as the cop’s 
fist shot out, Zabisky Half-turned 
away, caught the wrist, yanked 
the man to his chest, levering 
the elbow across His ribs. 

“You,” He said to the other cop. 
“Drop it or fix your partner so 
fie lias to drink His beer through 
a straw.” 

Tlie gun held steady on Zabis- 
ky. The cop twisted his mouth in 
a grin-like grimace. “What if I 
say tough lines, Rube? What’s an 
arm to me, compared to a slug 
la your kneecap — ■ especially if 
it's some other guy’s arm? 

Zabisky backed, dragging the 
policeman with him. “You better 
be good with the rod, copper. Oth- 
erwise your pal stops the slug.” 

“Could be, Rube. Let’s find 
out” The cop took up a pistol- 
range stance, body turned side- 
ways, gun arm straight out, left 
hand on hip, leaning back for bal- 
ance. He sighted carefully, still 
grinning — 

Falconer came up out of the 

166 



ditch in a rush, swept up tlie gun- 
ner and in a single movement 
threw him clear across the road 
to crash’ through unmowed 
brush, sending water splashing 
High. He gripped the coat-front 
of the other man, lifted him, 
shook him gently. 

“See to this man,” Ee said, nod- 
ding toward 1 the accident victim. 
“Come along, John. We’ve wasted 
too much time here.” He dropped 
the policeman, who sprawled 
where he had been deposited. Za- 
bisky hesitated a moment, then 
went quickly to the car, slid in un- 
der the wheel. He watched Fal- 
coner get in, slam tlie door. 

“Mister — I must be nuts, but 
I kind of like your style.” He 
started up, pulled off down the 
wet road with an acceleration that 
pressed both men back against 
the solid leather seats. 

i"'' rayle watched the instru- 
^ ments, holding the small air- 
craft at ten thousand feet, the 
airspeed at three hundred and 
forty. He paid no attention to the 
compass. Sitting in the seat before 
him, Anne stared out at the night, 
as opaque as black glass. The 
ship bucked and pitched, dropped 
abruptly, surged upward, rocked. 
The whine of the engines was an 
unending scream, like a cat in a 
fire. 

Grayle was frowning, his Head 
tilted. At the edge of hearing 

GALAXY 



there was a sound — a faint, rum- 
bling undercurrent to the back- 
ground din of the roaring turbo- 
probs. It grew steadily, became a 
roar. Off the port wingtip, slight- 
ly ahead, an orange glow appear- 
ed, winking fitfully, sliding clos- 
er. A point of green light became 
visible, then a white one, above 
and behind it. Vaguely, Grayle 
made out the metallic shape be- 
hind them. 

“It’s a jet fighter plane,” Anne 
gasped. “It’s pacing us.” 

Slowly, the jet moved ahead. 
Just before it reached the limit 
of visibility, it banked up, show- 
ing its port wingtip light, and 
whipped directly across the course 
of the smaller plane. Grayle fought 
the controls as the craft leaped 
and bounced in the slipstream. 
Anne pointed. A second jet had 
appeared on the right. 

“Hold on.” Grayle said. He 
threw the control stick sideways 
and applied full rudder, at the 
same time cutting the throttles 
and rotating the engines to the 
vertical. He feathered the propel- 
lers as the small plane veered 
sharply to the left and dropped 
like a stone. The altimeter wound 
down the scale, to nine thousand 
feet, eight, seven. 

At four thousand feet, he en- 
gaged the props, applied power. 
The engines shrieked; the fall 
slowed. He leveled off at two 
thousand feet indicated. 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



Grayle worked the controls, ro- 
tating the nacelles for forward 
thrust. For half a minute the 
plane streaked eastward in total 
darkness. Then the plane leaped 
as solid sound erupted around 
them. With a long, shattering 
roar, one of the jets flashed past. 
In the brief glow of its tailflame, 
wisps of fog whipped and tatter- 
ed, ragged sheets of rain whirled, 
dissipating. Grayle put the nose 
down and poured on full power. 
At under one thousand feet he 
leveled off again. For an instant, 
through a break in the enveloping 
mist, he caught a glimpse of a 
vague shape flashing past below. 
He pulled the nose up, throttled 
back, glanced at the altimeter; it 
indicated nine hundred feet. 

“Anne! On what principle does 
this altitude indicator operate? 
Reflected radiation? Or — ” 

Something dark loomed up be- 
fore them; Grayle whirled to 
Anne, caught Her in his arms, 
twisted to set his back against the 
padded panel as with a rending 
impact, the plane struck. 

6 6 Turner gency measures must be 
undertaken at once the 
ship says. “No time must be 
lost in returning to the battle 
line. I am operating on Final 
Emergency Reserves now. Un- 
less my power coil is re-ener- 
gized promptly, I will soon drop 
to a sub-alert state.” 



169 



“It’s going to take time, Xix,” 
Lokiien says. “I can’t leave you 
lying here exposed, to be picked 
over by every wandering souvenir 
hunter who comes past. Can you 
quarry enough s tone to conceal 
yourself?” 

“The energy expenditure will 
leave me drained,” the machine 
says. “But I compute that it can 
be done.” 

Lokrien gathers a few items in- 
to a pack, leaves the ship. 

“ Commander ,” the voice of Xix 
calls. 

Lokrien looks back to the 
sleek-lined hull. 

“I will be unable to speak after 
this expenditure of energy. Fare- 
well. Remember that I will be 
waiting beneath the rock, confi- 
dent of your return.” 

“ You were a good s Rip, Prax- 
ixytsaran the Ninth. You will be 
again, one day.” 

Behind Lokrien energy thun- 
dered. Bolts of blue-white fire 
rayed out to cut and lift great 
slabs of granite. When silence 
fell, nothing was to be seen but 
the tumbled rock, swathed in set- 
tling dust.

UoJ et me get tliis straight, Mr. 

' Hunnicut,” tli’e President 
said carefully. “You’re tell- 
ing me that the sole result of the 
shutdown of the power broadcast 
170 



is the plunging of seven Federal 
installations into darkness? That 
two unauthorized and unidenti- 
fied demand points are continuing 
to draw power?” 

“That’s about it, sir. Six of the 
installations are on emergency 
power or back on the New Eng- 
land Net. All but Caine Island.” 

“Perhaps I’m tired, Mr. Hunni- 
cut. How can these two bootleg 
receivers continue to draw power 
if you’re no longer generating 
power?” 

“Sir, that’s tlie point I’ve been 
trying to explain. The station is 
still generating — and still broad- 
casting. When I shut down trans- 
mission — or tried to — the 
breakers arced over, welded the 
circuits open. I’m broadcasting 
whether I like it or not. And the 
same goes for tlie generators. I 
can’t shut them down. The last 
man I sent in to manually dis- 
connect is in the infirmary now, 
Undergoing artificial respiration. 
We can’t even get into the gener- 
ator room. The whole thing is 
Hot.” 

“Mr. Hunnicut, it appears to 
me matters at your station Have 
gotten badly out of hand!” 

“Mr. President, as chief engin- 
eer here I take full responsibility. 
But what’s going on is abnormal 
— fantastically so! I don’t pre- 
tend to understand it, but I can 
assure you that this is more than 
just a simple malfunction. Some- 

GALAXY 



one — or something — is manip- 
ulating tKe station.” 

“Mr. Hunnicut, tiiis is not tKe 
time to slide off into mysticism! 
I want the broadcast of power 
from your station terminated at 
once, by any means at your com- 
mand. I Hope that’s quite clear?” 
“Yes, sir, but — ” 

“That’s all, Mr. Hunnicut.” 
The President’s face was dark 
with anger as lie racked tKe 
phone. He swiveled on the men 
standing beside liis desk. 

“General,” He addressed a com- 
pactly built officer in Army green, 
“how long will it take you to 
move a battalion of troops into 
the Upper Pasmaquoddie Sta- 
tion?” 

“Two hours from the moment 
you so order, sir.” 

“Better get moving, General.” 
He turned to a lean, white-haired 
man in the self-effacing gray. 
“Mr. Thorpe, have the personnel 
you’ve selected stand by to coop- 
erate with the Army as we dis- 
cussed. And in tKe meantime, let 
me know the instant your instru- 
ments indicate that my instruc- 
tions have been complied with.” 
The physicist nodded and scur- 
ried away. TKe President looked 
at the Secretary of the Interior, 
pale and owlish in the pre-dawn. 

“Funny. I wasn’t at all sure 
that shutting down the broadcast 
was the correct course, in spite of 
Mr. Hunnicut’s persuasiveness. 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



But now that Mr. Hunnicut 
seems to have changed his mind, 
I’m' damned if I’m going to 
change mine!” 

/“outside tKe office of tKe Gov- 
ernor, Caine Island Federal 
Penitentiary, a portable, five KW, 
generator chugged stolidly, pow- 
ering a string of wan lights has- 
tily rigged along the corridor. In- 
side the office, the governor grip- 
ped the telephone until his 
knuckles paled. He was shouting, 
not solely because of the boom- 
ing of the storm beyond 'die thick 
walls. 

“Possibly you still Haven’t 
grasped tKe situation here, Gov- 
ernor Cook! There are twelve 
Hundred and thirty-one maxi- 
mum-security Federal prisoners 
housed in this facility, whicH is 
now totally without power and 
light! The PA system is inopera- 
tive. My guard force is scattered 
all over the prison, without light 
or instructions. Incidentally, tKe 
walls here are rather thick; witK 
the air conditioning equipment 
inoperative, the air is rapidly 
growing foul. At the time the 
power was cut, three hundred of 
these men were in the dining hall; 
over two hundred were at tlieir 
duty posts in various parts of 
the facility. By the grace of God, 
almost seven Hundred of them 
were secured in their cells. They 
are there now ■ — in total dark- 

171 



ness. However, the locks in the 
prison are electrically operated. 
When the power failed, they au- 
tomatically went to the open po- 
sition. When the men discover 
that — well, I leave the results 
to your imagination.” 

As Hardman paused for breath, 
the voice of the governor of the 
State of Florida spoke calmly: 

“I understand the situation, 
Jim, and believe me this step 
wouldn’t have been taken had 
there been any alternative — ” 
“You sound as though the pow- 
er were cut intentionally!” 

“It was necessary to shut down 
the transmitter, Jim. The Presi- 
dent personally notified me, and 
believe me, the reasons he gave — ” 
“Damn the reasons he gave! 
Unless I have power here in an 
hour Caine Island will be the 
scene of the worst outbreak of 
prison violence in penal history! 
I’m sitting on a powder keg with 
the fuse lit.” 

“That’s enough, Jim!” the state 
governor cut in sharply. “I 
have my instructions, you have 
yours. You’re in charge of Caine 
Island, take whatever action is 
necessary to keep matters under 
control. That’s what you’re there 
for!” 

“Now, look Here, Governor — ” 
Hardman’s voice faded. He was 
talking into a dead receiver. He 
slammed the instrument down, 
swiveled to stare across the dim- 
172 



lit office at Lester Pale. In the 
absence of the hum of air- circula- 
tors, the wail and boom of the 
storm seemed really to tear the 
walls away. 

6 4 T T e hung up on me! After tell- 
-®-ing me that the power sys- 
tem was deliberately shut down! 
And I’m supposed to keep mat- 
ters under control, He says!” 

“Sir, I’ve managed to contact 
a dozen or so of the guard force, 
including Lieutenant Trent. He’s 
issued hand torches to the men, 
and they’re out rounding up as 
many others as they can find. In 
a few minutes we should have the 
majority assembled in the bar- 
racks.” 

“And then what? We huddle 
here and wait for the prisoners 
to realize they have the freedom 
of the prison?” 

“Lieutenant Trent is standing 
by for orders, sir,” Pale said 
carefully. 

Hardman rubbed his Hands up 
and down across His face, then sat 
erect. 

“Thanks, Lester,” He said. “I’m 
through’ making a fool of myself 
now, I hope. All right, we have 
a situation on our hands. Tell 
Trent to come up. I suppose 
our best bet is to concede the en- 
tire cell complex and establish 
ourselves in the Admin wing. We 
should Have enough men to con- 
trol access — ” He stopped talk- 

GALAXY 



Ing, cocked His Head. In tKe dis- 
tance there was a faint popping 
sound. 

“Gunfire!” Lester wKIrled to 
tHe door as it burst open. A man 
In guards’ blue slammed Halfway 
across tKe room before fie came 
to a Halt, breatfiing raggedly. 
He Held a pistol in His right Hand, 
pressing the side of tHe gun 
against His left shoulder. Black- 
IsK-red blood ran down His wrist 
and made a blot on His sleeve. 

“My God, Governor,” he blurt- 
ed. “They’ve busted out! They 
shot the lieutenant, and — ” 

“I’ll tell the rest,” a Hoarse 
voice said. 

A tall, rangy man in pris- 
on uniform, with weather-beat- 
en skin and stiff gray Hair 
came in tfirougfi the open door. 
TKe guard-issue gun in His Hand 
was pointed carelessly toward 
Hardman. THe guard whirled 
witK an inarticulate sound, bring- 
ing the gun around — 

TKe tall prisoner twitched the 
gun to cover Him, squeezed the 
trigger. There was a sKarp wtiac- 
whac! The sound of the dope 
pellets Hitting flesH was clearly 
audible. THe guard took a step 
back with rubbery legs whicK 
folded suddenly. He Hit the rug 
Hard and lay still. 

“I’m not Here to mess around, 
Governor,” Max Wiston said. 
“Here’s what I want from 
you. ...” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



/^rayle awoke with His face in 
icy water, the taste of mud 
in His mouth. For a timeless mo- 
ment His mind groped for orienta- 
tion: listened for the twang of 
bows, for tKe boom of cannon, tHe 
crackle of small-arms fire; for 
war-cries, or the screams of tHe 
wounded, tKe clasH of steel on 
steel, the thud of horses’ Hooves . 

But there was only the beating 
of the rain, Hitting tHe mud witK 
a sound like the rattle of muffled 
drums. Grayle sat up. Pain stab- 
bed at His ribs. 

TKe girl lay across His cfiest, 
unconscious. He touched her face; 
it was cold as ice. 

It took Grayle ten minuutes to 
lever tom metal aside, extricate 
the girl from tHe shattered craft 
and carry Her across a furrowed 
quagmire to tHe inadequate 
shelter of the trees which the 
lightning flashes revealed. 

He saw tHe path taken by tHe 
plane after it Had struck the 
crown of a tall oak, ploughed its 
way tKrougK massed foliage, shed- 
ding wings and empennage in the 
process, to impact in a ploughed 
field. It was a miracle the girl Had 
survived. 

He was forced to lie down then. 
The rain fell; the wind moaned 
in the trees. 

Lights, and men’s voices. Grayle 
got to His feet with difficulty, 
feeling broken ribs grate. A line 
of lights showed on a ridge half 

173 



a mile distant, parked vehicles, 
he guessed. The lights were 
moving across the field to- 
ward Him. He thrust aside the 
breath-slapping pain, forced His 
mind to focus on the situation. 
The path of the small craft Had 
been followed on radar, no doubt. 
But they couldn’t be sure whether 
he Had landed safely, crashed or 
flown on at tree-top level. And 
that, perhaps, gave Kim a chance 
— if he moved quickly. 

He bent over Anne, feeling over 
her for apparent injuries. There 
were many small cuts and abra- 
sions, but it was impossible to 
say if she were seriously Kurt. She 
needed medical Kelp, quickly. He 
looked across toward the ap- 
proaching lights — and at other 
lights, advancing now from the 
opposite direction. They Had 
thrown a cordon around the area, 
were closing the noose from all 
sides. Time was running out. He 
must slip through them now, or 
not at all. 

He scooped the unconscious 
girl up in his arms, picked a di- 
rection in which the lights seem- 
ed more widely spaced, and set 
off across the boggy ground, 
keeping His course between two 
lights. Once he dropped low as 
the beam of a powerful light tra- 
versed the field; but tKe same 
light showed Him a drainage ditch 
marked by a growth of weeds. He 
angled across to it, slid down into 
174 



knee-deep, muddy, swirling wa- 
ter. He flattened Himself against 
the bank as two men passed by a 
few feet above, one on each side 
of the ditch. He followed the ditch 
for another hundred feet, then left 
it and altered course forty-five de* 
grees to the right, toward the 
road. 

He came up onto the pavement 
fifty yards behind tKe last of 
the three cars in line, moved up, 
keeping to the ditch. Two men in 
rainproofs stood in tlie middle of 
the road between the first and 
second cars in line. Both carried 
rifles under their arms. Grayle 
came level with the last car, a 
four-door sedan with police mark- 
ings and a tall antenna. The cour- 
tesy light glared as h'e opened the 
front door, slid Anne onto the 
seat. Her Head lolled on her shoul- 
der. Pink blood seeped down Her 
wet face. Her breathing was regu- 
lar Hut shallow. 

Something on the back seat 
caugKt Grayle’s eye: a snubnosed 
sub-macEine gun. There was also 
a double-barreled shotgun, box- 
es of ammunition and a web belt 
hung with fragmentation gren- 
ades. Grayle caugKt up tlie belt, 
strapped it on. 

TKere was a shout; the two 
men in the road were running 
toward the car. Grayle crossed 
the ditch, came up against a barb- 
ed-wire fence; he broke the 
strands with His Hands and ran. 

GALAXY 



Half a mile from tlie road, He 
paused, raised his Head, pivoting 
slowly, as if searching the wind 
for a scent. Then He set off at a 
Steady run to the west-northwest. 

Z abisky slowed as tKe Head- 
lights of the Auburn picked 
up a dark shape blocking the road 
ahead. He halted twenty feet 
from a big olive-drab half-truck 
pulled across the narrow pave- 
ment. A man came forward, 
swinging a lantern. Zabisky low- 
ered the window. 

“Road’s closed,” the man said 
He wore a military-type steel 
helmet and carried a slung rifle. 

“What’s the matter, road 
washed out?” Zabisky inquired. 

“Convoy coming through,” the 
man said. He huddled in his green 
slicker, water dripping from the 
lielmet rim. “Say, that’s a wild 
car you got there. What is it, one 
of them foreign jobs?” 

“Naw — made in Oklahoma. 
Listen, bud, we got to get through, 
see. We’re on like important busi- 
ness.” 

Tlie man shook his Head, shift- 
ed the rifle to the other soulder. 
“Nothing doing. You got to go 
back to Pineville, take state road 

11 — ” 

“We got no time for that.” 
“Never mind, John,” Falconer 
said. He leaned across. “How long 
will the road be closed, soldier?” 
“Beats me, Mister.” 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



“What’s going on around here?” 
“Hell, who tells us anything? 
We get called out in the middle 
of this lousy storm, and — ” 
“Okay, knock it off, dogface.” 
Another man had come over from 
the side of the road, a big fellow 
with a staff sergeant’s stripes on 
his helmet. “What do you think 
this is, a boy-scout jamboree?” 
He turned a black-browed look 
on the car and its occupants. “All 
right, you been told. Now get that 
heap turned around and get out 
of here before I have to get 
tough.” 

Zabisky gave the sergeant a 
long look. 

“How about it, Mr. Falconer?” 
He said loudly. “You want me to 
call your pal the general on tlie 
car phone?” 

Falconer smiled slightly. “That 
won’t be necessary, John. He Had 
been glancing at the map. “Ser- 
geant, it’s a long way back to 
route eleven, and it doesn’t seem 
to be going in the right direction.” 
“Things are tough all over. 
Now pull out of Here like I told 
you — and you can call your pal 
the general and tell him I said 
so!” 

TH'alconer opened his door and 
-*• stepped out. The headlights 
threw a tall shadow across the 
curtain of rain as He came around 
the front of the car. The sergeant 
waited, his thumbs Hooked in the 

175 



pistol belt around His stomacH. 
Falconer came up to Him and 
witEout pausing drove Ms fist in 
a six-incE jab into tfie man’s 
belly. THe sergeant made an ex- 
plosive sound and doubled over, 
fell to His knees. TEe soldier be- 
hind Him gave a yell, fumbled His 
rifle from His shoulder in time 
for Falconer to catcE it, twitcE it 
away and toss it into tHe ditcE. 
THen He stepped in and slammed 
a sEort rigKt Hook to tHe startled 
lad’s jaw. He tumbled down 
against tHe side of tHe car. 

“Hey, you didn’t need to slug 
tHe kid,” Zabisky said. He Had 
scrambled out of the car and 
grabbed the sergeant’s pistol. 

“A nice bruise on th'e jaw will 
Help Him when He talks to His 
CO,” Falconer said. “Let’s go.” 
He started toward the big vehicle 
blocking tHe road. 

“Hey — wEere are you going?” 
Zabisky called. 

“This is as far as we can go 
by ordinary car,” Falconer said. 
“We were lucky to find better 
transportation waiting for us.” 

“Are you kidding, brother? 
Talking about Heisting a tank off 
th’e Army?” 

“You don’t need to come along, 
JoEn. Take tHe car and go back. 
But I suggest you abandon it at 
tHe first opportunity. TEe ser- 
geant will give a detailed descrip- 
tion of it as soon as He catches 
His breath.”

Zabisky stared at Him. “Why 
not tell me wHat tHis is all 
about? THe whole thing is nuts 
— and tHis is tHe nuttiest item 
yet!” He jerked a tEumb at tHe 
Half-track. 

Falconer sHook His Head. 
“Good-by, John,” He said. “I’m 
grateful for your Kelp.” ” 
Zabisky made a tHrowing-away 
motion. “Forget it,” He said. “I 
told you I was in witH you. I 
ain’t quitting now.” 

Seated in tHe armored veEicle, 
Falconer looked over tHe panel, 
pressed the starting button. TEe 
big engine roared to life. He put 
it in gear, rolled forward, down 
into the ditcE, up the otEer side, 
flattening a fence. He corrected 
course slightly, then settled down 
to steering the big macHine up 
across sloping ground to the dark 
mass of the Hills ahead. 

/^thief Engineer Daniel Hunni- 
^ cut, His Operations CEief, 
Sam Webb, and two maintenance 
engineers stood in tEe brilliantly 
lit passage outside the switcH-gear 
room of the Pasmaquoddie Power 
Station. They were dressed in 
Heavy rubber suits, gauntlets and 
boots; eacS carried breathing ap- 
paratus. Hunnicut Held a black 
waxed carton firmly gripped to 
His cHest. THe engineers clutcEed 
coils of Heavy wire. Tools were 
belted about their waists. 

“I don’t know How mucH time 
GALAXY 



we’ll Have,” Hunnicut said into 
the lip mike inside Els breathing 
Helmet. “It’s Hotter than tEe main 
bearings of Hell in tfiere. You all 
know wjHat to do. No waste mo- 
tion, no false moves. We place 
tEe charges, fix detonators and 
get out. Any questions?” 

TEe tEree men sliook tEeir 
Heads. 

“TEen let’s go.” Hunnicut un- 
dogged tEe Heavy door, swung it 
outward. 

A blast of ligEt and Heat struck 
at Eim, scorcEing even tHrougH 
tEe insulated suits. At once tEe 
cooling units went into High- 
speed operation. TEe cEief en- 
gineer led tEe way across tEe 
HigE-ceilinged room, past a gray- 
brigEt patch of soEdified metal 
snaking across tEe floor to tEe 
base of tEe main breaker bank. 
He placed tfie carton on tEe floor; 
tEe wax was melting, trickling 
down tEe sides. His fingers in tEe 
tEicH gauntlets were clumsy, tear- 
ing away tEe paper wrappings. He 
lifted out tEe cigar-sHaped 
charges of explosive, linked to- 
gether in clusters of four, Handed 
tfiem to Webb, wEo swiftly in- 
serted tEem at tEe previously se- 
lected points around tEe base of 
tEe massive apparatus. One of tEe 
engineers began attaching linking 
wires. 

The other busied fiimself lay- 
ing a Heavy cables across the 
floor.

“Tfiat’s all of them,” Hunnicut 
said. Webb nodded, tucking tEe 
last charge in place. TEe engineers 
linked up tEeir wires, rose to tEeir 
feet, looking to Hunnicut. 

“Out,” Ee said. TEe three men 
went past Eim to tEe door. TEe 
two engineers passed tErougH in- 
to the corridor. Webb paused to 
glance back. He froze, pointed 
past Hunnicut. TEe latter turned. 
A coil of smoke was rising from 
tEe insulated wire attached to tEe 
lowest cluster of explosives. Hun- 
nicut took a step toward it. Webb 
yelled, jumped after Eis cEief as 
tEe wire burned tErougH. TEe 
cEarge dropped to the floor. Hun- 
nicut took a quick step, bent to 
pick up tEe smoking cEarge — ■ 

TEe men in tEe passage were 
tErown from tEeir feet by the 
terrific, booming blast. Acoustical 
panels dropped from the ceiling. 
TErougH the dust boiling from 
tEe doorless opening to the swltcfi 
gear room, tEey caugEt a glimpse 
of a tattered thing of rags that 
fell away from tEe scorched 1 and 
shattered wall which was opposite 
the entry. 

Later examination identified 
Webb by tEe fillings in a surviving 
jaw fragment. No recognizable 
portion of Hunnicut was ever re- 
covered. 

Power continued to flow from 
tEe generators to the great an- 
tenna arrays of tEe Upper Pas- 
maquoddie Power Station. 

GALAXY 



T J*or two weeks Gralgrathor has 
lain on a bed of stretched 
hides in the great Hall of Bjorn- 
dahl, taking no food, swallowing 
only the mixture of wine and wa- 
ter that the old crone Siv presses 
on him before she and the other 
serving women perform the daily 
ritual of stripping away the dried, 
salt-impregnated cloths from the 
massive burn areas, tearing away 
along with them the day’s accum- 
ulation of dead tissue, after which 
they smear reeking bearfat over 
him and rebandage him. 

On this fifteenth day, he rises 
for the first time. The servants 
find him on the floor and lift him 
back on his bed. Two days later, 
he walks unaided to the door. 
Thereafter, he walks a little each 
day, swinging his arms, stretching 
the healing skin until the sweat of 
pain stands across his forehead. 
During the following days he 
practices with his weapons until 
he has regained a measure of his 
former skill. In the evenings, he 
roams the hills with the hound 
Odinstooth at his heels. During 
this time he says no more than a 
dozen words a day. He tolerates 
no reference to his dead wife and 
child, or to the were demon who 
slew them on his doorstep. 

A month has passed when Gtal- 
grathor climbs the steep escarp- 
ment to the ravine where the boat 
had lain. He finds a vast crater of 
broken rock, already overgrown 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



with wild berry vines. He stands, 
looking down at it tor a long time* 
Then he makes his way back. 

The next day, he calls his 
household together and makes 
distribution of his lands and pos- 
sessions among his servants. With 
only the aging Hull as companion, 
and carrying only a leather- 
thonged hammer as weapon, he 
sets off on foot along the shore to 
the south.

nphree men sat in a staff car 
parked beside th'e road oppo- 
site tfie exotic-looking civilian car 
abandoned by tlie hijackers. In 
the front seat were Captain 
Zwicky of the US First Army and 
Lieutenant Harmon, of tfie Flori- 
da State Police, in mufti. In tfie 
rear, Sergeant Milton Gassman 
slumped, fiis round face waxy- 
gray in tfie yellow glow of tfie 
dome-ligfit. 

“Let’s Gear tfiat one more time, 
Gassman,” Zwicky said crisply. 
He spoke loudly, over tfie drum 
of tfie rain. “You and Bogen were 
manning your posts, a car witfi 
two armed civilians drives up, 
and then — wliat?” 

“The guy tricked me like I 
said, Cap’n. He talks nice, fie 
looks Harmless — ” 

“You’re sure about tfie face?” 
Harmon cut in. “No scars? None 
at all?” 



179 



“I’m sure. I tell you the guy 
was baby-faced, not even sun- 
burned.” 

“But His Hair was gray?” 
“YeaE, gray. I thought at first 
fie was blond, but I seen Him good 
in the light. But He’s no old duf- 
fer. He Had a wallop like a mule,” 
Gassman rubbed his ribs gently. 

“That’s our boy,” Harmon said. 
“I don’t know how He covers so 
much ground so fast, but it’s him, 
all right. We’ll get him now. He 
can’t be far from here in twenty 
minutes. A copter ■ — ” 

“It’s not so easy,” Zwicky said. 
“He took off cross-country, and in 
tfis weather no copter is flying.” 
“Where Ee can go, we can fol- 
low him! He took your half-track. 
Okay ; so we follow him in a half- 
track.” 

“Sure. I’ll Have one Here in an- 
other ten minutes. That gives 
y©ur man a half-hour start. If he 
knows how to handle a track — 
aad I’ve got a hunch lie does — • 
he’ll hold that lead. And up where 
lie’s headed, there are plenty of 
places to get lost. He’ll ditch the 
track and — ” 

“You saying lie’s too much for 
the US Army?” 

“I’m just saying hold your 
Horses, Mr. Harmon, I had a 
phone call that told me to take 
you along, but it didn’t say any- 
thing about turning command of 
the company over to you. I have 
men and. equipment to think of, 

TW 



in addition to a little chore of 
convoy escort the colonel kind of 
hoped I’d see to.” 

“Sure, sure, I’m not trying to 
tell you your business. But it 
gravels me to Have to sit Here and 
let the cop -killing son of a bitch 
slip through my fingers!” 

“When did lie kill a cop? .My 
information was the guy broke 
out of jail, that’s all.” 

“Okay, you want to get techni- 
cal, lie just roughed up a few 
cops, maybe they’ll live. It’s all 
the same to this boy.” 

Captain Zwicky looked Hard 
at Harmon. “You take your job 
pretty personally, don’t you?” 
“You might say I got a person- 
al stake in this deal.” 

“Just remember you’re a long 
way out of your jurisdiction. 
And this is Army business.” 
“Yeah, sure. I won’t get in your 
way, Zwicky.” 

“Better make that Captain 
Zwicky as long as you’re attached 
to my command, Harmon.” 
Harmon smiled sardonically, 
sketched a two-finger salute. 

“We don’t play games with the 
military courtesies in this outfit, 
Harmon,” the captain snapped. 
Harmon’s heavy face blanked, 
tried a grin, then a frown. He sat 
up in the seat, yanked his lapels 
straight. 

“Okay! Excuse me, for chris- 
sake. I’m not pushing. I’m just 
along for the ride.” 



GALAXY 



“TEat’s rigKt. I advise you to 
remember it.” 

In a Heavy silence, tEey waited 
for tEe arrival of tHe Ealf-track. 

'"T'welve miles to tHe nortH- 
nortEwest, Colonel Ajax Py- 
ler of tEe TEird Armored Divi- 
sion, First Army, stood witli a trio 
of regimental staff officers in tHe 
scant sKelter of a big pine tree on 
tHe long slope of ground rising 
toward tHe blazing ligEts of tHe 
power station Half a mile distant. 
On tHe road, tHe convoy witE dim- 
med EeadligEts, stretcfied for five 
Hundred yards back into tHe dark-

onel’s face, blurred tHe lenses of 
tHe binoculars He Held trained on 
tHe power station. 

“EverytEing looks normal, 
Cal,” He said, Handing tHe glasses 
to a burly major beside Kim. 

“I still don’t get it, Colonel,” 
tHe major said. “Sending a regi- 
ment of armor in Here . wHat 
are we supposed to do, guard tHe

Jesus!” He wiped rainwater from 
His foreKead witE a finger and 
sHook His Head. “Sometimes I 
tKink tHey’re all nuts up topside.” 
“I’m in tHe dark too, Cal. My 
orders were to position tHe regi- 
ment and stand by, tHat’s all.” 
“Call tHis a position?” THe ma- 
jor waved at tHe line of veEicles. 

“As far as I know, we aren’t 
expected to attack,” tHe colonel 
AND NOW THEY WAKE 



said witK a bleak smile. He clap- 
ped tHe shorter man on tHe back. 
“CEeer up, Cal. We all needed 
tHe exercise.” 

“Sir!” THe communication tecH 
sergeant was at tHe colonel’s side 
witH a field telepHone. “Division 
on tHe line.” 

“Colonel Pyler,” tHe officer 
said, turning His back to tHe pelt- 
ing rain. He listened, frowning. 

“Yes, yes. ... I understand. 
About ten minutes, I’d say.” He 
looked toward tHe ligKts of tEe 
power station as He Handed tEe 
instrument back to tEe comm 
man. 

“All rigfit, gentlemen,” He ad- 
dressed tHe officers standing by, 
“Position your units around tHe 
peripKery of a Half-mile circle 
centered on tHe station — guns 
pointing in. Cal, detacH six men 
under a company officer. Have 
tKem stand by to escort a party 
of civilians in.” He made a mo- 
tion of dismissal as several of- 
ficers started to speak at once. 
“THat’s it, gentlemen. Move out.” 

Accompanied by tHe sergeant, 
Pyler walked back to tHe road, 
went along tHe line of looming 
ligEt and medium tanks to tEe 
weapons carrier wEere His driver 
waited. At His instruction, tHe 
driver turned, drove back to tEe 
rear of tfie column. THree men in 
civilian clotEes and raincoats 
stepped out of an olive-drab staff 
car and came over.

“All right, Mr. Crick, gentle- 
men. We’re to proceed.” The ci- 
vilians, two of whom carried 
Heavy canvas equipment kits, 
climbed into the higK-wfieeled 
vehicle. It turned, rolled back 
up past the column. At the head 
of the line, two jeeps waited, 
each carrying four men. They fell 
in behind. In silence the three 
cars proceeded along the road, fol- 
lowing a gentle curve up tlie grad- 
ual slope. Ahead, a gate flanked 
by massive brick walls blocked 
the way. 

XTTtule the Headlights dazzled 

’ ' on tire steel panels, two 
men stepped down and went for- 
ward. There was a telephone box 
mounted on the wall. One of the 
men, a lieutenant with a slung 
carbine, spoke into the phone. Al- 
most at once the gates slid back. 
The men re-entered the jeep and 
the three-vehicle convoy rolled 
ahead. 

The road led straight up a 
number three grade to the high, 
blank walls of the power plant 
and the towering, light-spangled 
antenna farm spreading up the 
Hillside behind it. A number of 
men were standing before the 
lighted entry to the big building. 
Pyler halted the ton-and-a-half 
and climbed down. 

“Thank God you’re Here, Col- 
onel,” the first of the men on foot 
blurted as he came up. “It’s been 
182 



a nightmare ever since the explo- 
sion! Phone out, automatic sys- 
tems out, instruments out — ” 

“Hold on, sir,” the colonel cut 
Him off. “Better take it from the 
beginning — and let’s get my 
technical people in on this.” He 
waited until the three civilians 
Had gathered around. By then 
three more men had arrived from 
the plant. The rain swirled and 
churned around them. In the glare 
of headlights, a million tiny crys- 
talline tulip® sprouted on the glis- 
tening pavement. 

“I’m Prescott, Maintenance 
Chief,” the plant man said. “Hun- 
nicut left me in charge when he 
and Webb went in with explosives 
to blast the switch gear out of the 
circuit. It was all fused down, 
you know. Wilson went in earlier, 
and — but I suppose you know 
about that; Hunnicut reported it. 
Wilson died, by the way. Any- 
way, something went wrong, we 
don’t know what. Hunnicut and 
Webb were blown to atoms. For 
nothing. Everything’s still run- 
ning full blast.” 

“You say Hunnicut is dead?” 
one of the civilians cut in. 

“That’s right. And Sam Webb, 
our ops chief.” 

“All right, let’s get down to 
specifics,” another of the new- 
comers said briskly. “Give us a 
breakdown on exactly what’s been 
going on here. All we’ve had is 
some garbled story that the gen- 

GALAXY 



erators won’t let themselves be 
sEut down.” 

“Tfiat’s not garbled, brotEer, 
tEat’s tEe God’s truth!” TEe ex- 
cited man went on witE His ac- 
count of tlie events of the last 
tEree hours. 

TEe tEree imported experts lis- 
tened in silence, with only an oc- 
casional terse question. 

“Don’t know what else to try,” 
Prescott concluded. “At every 
point where we might have bro- 
ken the circuits, the gear Has 
fused and tlie surrounding areas 
are electrified. Hot as firecrack- 
ers! We can’t even get close to 
it” 

“Well?” Pyler demanded of Eis 
crew. “WEat about it? If Pres- 
cott’s right, any ideas you may 
Have had about walking in and 
throwing switches are out tEe 
window.” 

“I’d Eke to see some of tEis 
for myself,” the tallest of tEe 
three civilians said. “Not tEat I 
doubt Mr. Prescott’s word. You 
understand.” 

“Go ahead. You’ll find just 
wEat I said. But for God’s sake 
wear protective gear!” 

“Oh, I don’t think that will be 
necessary — ” 

“Do as he suggests, Mr. Tad- 
lor,” Pyler ordered. 

With an amused smile, Tadlor 
comphed, donning gear from tEe 
kit he carried. His two colleagues 
did Hkewise. 

AND NOW THEY WAKE 



( i !\/T y orders are to stand 

1VJ. outside tEe building until 
you gentlemen give me an all- 
clear,” Pyler growled. “Make it 
fast.” He turned* to Prescott. 
“How close can I bring my ve- 
hicles?” 

“So far there Haven’t been any 
manifestations outside the build- 
ing proper, except at the switch 
Houses, ” the man said doubtfully. 

Pyler gave an order. TEe cars 
pulled forward, the men walking 
beside them. Under the loom of 
the High portico, they Halted. 
Tadlor and Eis aides, witE Pres- 
cott, started up the steps. TEe 
doors swung abruptly open. A 
man staggered out, clutching him- 
self. TEe sleeves of Eis shirt were 
shredded, and blood ran down Eis 
arms and dripped from Eis el- 
bows. TEere was a scarlet blister 
as big as tEe palm of a Hand 
along the side of Eis neck and 
jaw.

Tadlor’s Hand went out to tKe 
door. A blue spark crackled, 
jumped to meet Him. For an in- 
stant, a Kalo danced about tKe 
tall, lean man, then Ke made a 
comical leap into the air, fell 
sprawling, clownlike. His two men 
halted, then ran forward, bent 
over Kim. One straightened, look- 
ed down with wide eyes. 

“He’s dead.” 

“Get Kim back to tKe convoy, 
into a respirator!” Pyler called, 
motioning swiftly to the armed 
soldiers from the jeep. 

One of tKe men wKo Had Help-

“Dont try,” he croaked. “Too

“WHat do you mean?” Prescott

“You saw wKat Happened to

“But I still Have forty-odd peo-

“Not any more, Mr. Prescott.

“Into tfie vehicles, fast!” Py-

“Colonel — what are you going

THE DROWNED 

CIVILIZATION 

TJeople who write regular col- 
umns have to accept the fact 
that they’ll get letters; and I get 
my share. Many of the letters 
are questions and many of the 
questions refer to matters of the 
moment; for example the passage 
of planetoid Icarus and the flight 
of Zond - 5 around the moon pro- 
duced, between them, about a 






185 



dozeai. But some questions recur 
without a detectable cause and 
one of these recurring questions 
is wfiat will Happen to civilization 
if tfie polar icecaps sEould melt. 

If those climatologists who 
claim that tfie overall climate is 
growing warmer are right, tfie 
question Has a certain validity. 
If tfie climate grows warmer, 
some ice will melt somewhere. But 
it cannot, under any circum- 
stances, be a sudden melting; it 
must be a very gradual process, 
taking several centuries. 

This is tfie gist of tfie answer 
I recently gave to a worried read- 
er. Since then I Have received a 
fact sheet about tfie volume of 
water on earth from tfie Depart- 
ment of tfie Interior which en- 
ables me to write a kind of out- 
line for a scenice-fiction story 
where the ice is melted by some 
malevolent (or just water-loving) 
aliens within one year or so. But 
before we can wax dramatic we 
need to know the figures involved. 

The total amount of water on 
earth — liquid, frozen or vapor 
in the atmosphere — has been 
calculated to be 326,074,000 cubic 
miles. Of this total, 317 million 
cubic miles (or 97.2 per cent of 
all the water on earth) is in the 
oceans. Inland seas and salt lakes 
account for 25,000 cubic miles, 
freshwater lakes and rivers ac- 
count for 30,300 cubic miles and 
the water vapor in the atmosphere 
136 



is estimated to be the equivalent 
of 3100 cubic miles of liquid wa- 
ter. An estimated 2 million cubic 
miles are in the ground as soil 
moisture, subterranean rivers and 
likes and ground water in general. 

Now we come to the crucial 
figures, those for frozen water. 

The ice over Antarctica amounts 
to 6,500,000 cubic miles or just 
about 2 per cent of the total, 
while the ice of the Arctic and of 
all glaciers anywhere equals 500,- 
000 cubic miles, or 0.154 per cent 
of the total. Much of the Arctic 
ice is floating ice. Its melting 
would not influence tfie sea level, 
since ice displaces its own weight 
of water. 

So tfie question concerns main- 
ly the 6.5 million cubic miles of 
Antarctic ice — incidentally tfie 
largest amount of fresfi water on 
eartfi. Supposing tfiat all of it 
melts, it will produce about Q 
million cubic miles of liquid wa- 
ter which will increase the total 
volume of ocean water to 323 mil- 
lion cubic miles. (Then the oceans 
would hold 99 per cent of all the 
water on earth.) In order to an- 
swer the question of what the 
melting Antarctic ice will do to 
civilization we must find out how 
much the oceans would rise and 
for that we have to know their 
surface area. At present it is 139.5 
million square miles. 

Dividing 6 by 139.5 we get 0.043 ; 
this is the sea level rise in miles. 

GALAXY 



One tentfi of a mile is 528 feet, 
Hence one Hundredth of a mile is 
52.8. Tfierefore we Have to multi- 
ply 52.8 by 43, tfie result is 
227 feet. TKis figure looks a bit 
worse tfian reality would be, for 
tiSe calculation Has Keen made a§ 
if tHe oceans were one large bas- 
in witfi vertical walls. In reality 
tfie first tiling tfiat would Happen 
is tfiat tfie oceans would increase 
tfieir surface area by flooding 
all low-lying land along tfie coast 
lines. Increase of tfieir area would, 
of course, reduce tfie additional 
Keigfit of tfie water level. Taking 
all tfie factors Into account as 
well as tfiat can be done, we would 
end up witfi a greatly changed 
world map and a sea level about 
60 feet Higher tlian it was before 
tfie presumed aliens went to work 
on Antarctica 

npfie continents least affected by 
tfie cfiange would be Africa 
and Australia. Australia would 
lose land along tfie Great Austra- 
lian Bigfit, its southern coast and 
a few snippets elsewhere. Africa 
would lose land along its western 
bulge and most of tfie Lybiafi 
desert would be flooded. Tfie Nile 
would be a much 1 sfiorter river, and 
Africa would, in all probability, 
be an island continent, not con- 
nected witfi any of tfie otfiers. I 
had to say “in all probability” 
because nobody can foresee wfial 
earthquakes and volcanisin might

do. We can be almost certain that 
shifting loads of water will trig- 
ger eartfiquakes and volcanoes, 
but so far not enough is known 
about tins to make detailed pre- 
dictions. 

Tfie main inroads of tfie water 
in South America would be in tfie 
valleys of tfie Amazon and tfie 
Rio de la Plata. South America 
also is likely to end up as an is- 
land continent. 

Tfie territorial losses in North 
America would be large and un- 
pleasant. Tfie so-called Gulf 
Plain around tfie Mississippi delta 
would simply disappear; it would 
be flooded as far nortfi as tfie 
Ozark Plateau. Florida would 
lose much territory and end up 
as a group of islands. Tfie Geor- 
gia coastline would be flooded. 
In the nortfi, land would be lost 
all along tfie coast. Tfiere would 
be a considerable increase in tfie 
area of Hudson Bay, mainly to 
its west and soutfi. In tfie west, 
tfie Gulf of California would go 
north and pour into tfie Salton 
gea and' its surrounding area. 

Tfie most drastic cfianges would 
fie in Europe and nearby portions 
of Asia. Tfie southeast of England 
would Be gone; an enlarged Firtfi 
of Fortfi would join water with 
tile Clyde, making Scotland an is- 
land. Ireland would lose in the 
west. Tfie Netherlands, North 
Germany, Denmark and Finland 
would suffer greatly; and the Rus- 

187 



sians would face inroads into tKeir 
territory both' from the south and 
the north’. There would be an en- 
ormous inflow into the Mediter- 
ranean through the Strait of Gi- 
braltar and the rising waters 
would spread east into the Black 
Sea and the Sea of Azov, break- 
ing into land from there to the 
north of the Caucasus Moun- 
tains. The Caspian Sea (now with 
a water level 96 feet below ocean 
level) would be filled up and 
would in turn flood large areas 
(also below present sea level) to 
its north. From the north, Russia 
would be invaded by water on 
both sides of the Ural Mountains. 
The outcome would probably be 
that European Russia would be 
bordered by the sea in the east, 
with the Urals as a very long is- 
land to the east of the coastline. 
And east of the Urals, the valley 
of the River Ob would also be 
drowned — a situation that may 
comfort those who wonder wheth- 
er the Soviets might not melt the 
Antarctic ice with hydrogen 
bombs in order to drown much of 
North America. 

Well, this is the picture of the 
earth if all the ice were turned 
into water. All the continents 
would be separated from each 
other by broad stretches of shal- 
low water. Northern Europe 
would be an archipelago of a few 
large and small islands. In the 
Pacific Ocean, on the other: Hand, 
188 



there would only be a very few 
islands left — until the corals 
catch up with the new sea level, 
that is. However, civilization 
would not be drowned; .it would 
merely be relocated in a number 
of places. And if this is a conso- 
lation, the climate of many areas 
that now suffer from very hot 
summers and frigid winters would 
be greatly ameliorated. 

But after having looked in 
some detail at the way things 
might be, let us not forget that 
all this has little to do with re- 
ality. Nobody can — or would, 
if He could — melt the Antarctic 
ice. And if a natural process, a 
generally warmer climate, were 
to melt it, the melting would be 
very slow and also self -limiting. 
Why self-limiting? Because the 
earth’s axis would still be tilted 
by 23^2 ° to the ecliptic, and both 
the Arctic and the Antarctic re- 
gions would still have their long 
sunless nights. The melting, pro- 
cess could go on only during the 
summer months; during the win- 
ter (northern or southern) one 
pole would still be cold, no mat- 
ter How warm it was elsewhere. 
And moisture carried by winds 
over the sunless area would still 
fall there as snow. 

One may make the assumption 
that in a generally warmer cli- 
mate the snow deposited during 
the winter might not replace all 
the ice that melted during the 

GALAXY 



summer. But it is a plain impos- 
sibility tKat all tEe ice on earth 1 
can turn into liquid water. 



OUR ZONE OF ACTION 

nphis section is based on one of 
the letters that came, so to 
speak, in the wake of the passage 
of Icarus. The letter said that, 
according to the Los Angeles 
Times, the asteroid passed at a 
distance of four million miles. 
This, my correspondent conclud- 
ed correctly, was too far away for 
the earth to influence its orbit. 
But if Icarus had passed much 
more closely, wouldn’t we have 
acquired a second moon? 

The answer to that question is 
“no” — ■ but I know from experi- 
ence tliat it is very hard to make 
this “no” sound convincing. Af- 
ter all, our planet exerts a fairly 
powerful gravitational pull, so if 
something comes close enough, 
why doesn’t the earth keep it? 

The discussion of why it could 
not has to begin with Pierre Si- 
mon de Laplace about one and a 
half centimes ago. While he was 
working on his major book, the 
Celestial Mechanics, it suddenly 
occurred to him that in the vicin- 
ity of a planet, the planet’s gra- 
vitational force must be locally 
stronger than that of the sun. 
Laplace called the area where 
the planet ruled supreme the 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



planet’s “zone of action”; and he 
derived a formula for calculating 
it. The two factors that determine 
the diameter of the zone of ac- 
tion are, first, the size of the plan- 
et, or rather the strength of its 
gravitational field. The second 
factor is the distance of the plan- 
et from the sun. Since the sun’s 
gravitational field is weakened by 
distance, the same planet would 
acquire a larger zone of action 
if it were moved to a greater dis- 
tance from the sun. 

It follows logically that Mer- 
cury must Have the smallest zone 
of action, because it is both the 
smallest planet and also the one 
closest to the sun. It also follows 
that Neptune, though consider- 
ably smaller than Jupiter, Has a 
zone of action almost twice as 
large as tliat of Jupiter, because 
it is much farther from the sun. 

The table shows the size of the 
zone action for the planets of our 
solar system, calculated in ac- 
cordance with Laplace’s formula. 
It can be seen that in each case 
this zone is much' larger than 
the distance to the outermost 
moon, of the planet. Even in the 
case of Jupiter's moon No. IX, 
the moon is only half way to the 
edge of the zone of action. Inside 
this zone, a planet could Hold a 
moon. That, however, does not 
mean that anything that strays 
inside the zone of action of a 
planet will stay inside tliat zone.

* measured from the center of the planet 



Tf Icarus Had passed at a dis- 
tance of only 26,250 miles, 
counting from the center of the 
earth, its orbit would Have been 
greatly altered because of this 
intrusion into our zone of action. 
It would Have been whipped 
around the earth in a Hyperbolic 
curve, and during the next three 
weeks or so several computers 
would Have been occupied with 
the problem of tKe new orbit. But 
that new orbit would still Have 
been an orbit around tKe sun, be- 
cause Icarus would Have escaped 
from our zone of action again. 
The reason is that it would Have 
been far too fast to go into an 
orbit 26,250 miles from the cen- 
ter of the eartK. 

That distance is, as many read- 
ers will have realized, the distance 
of tKe synchronous orbit of com- 
munication satellites. It is nor- 
mally given as 22,300 miles be- 
cause tKe distances of artificial 
satellites are counted from sea 
190 



level. THe reason for doing this is 
partly for tKe purpose of making 
a clear distinction between artifi- 
cial and natural objects in space; 
and partly because we naturally 
think of the distance of an artifi- 
cial satellite in terms of its dis- 
tance from us, that is from the 
surface. 

A satellite in the synchronous 
orbit moves with an orbital ve- 
locity of 1.9 miles per second. If 
it is faster, it will not stay in this 
orbit but wander away until a 
balance has been reached. If that 
body, for example, moved with a 
velocity of 2.5 miles per second, 
it would use up some of its ve- 
locity by climbing away from the 
eartli and it might then settle in 
an orbit 50,000 miles out. But if 
the body moves at that distance 
with a velocity of 5 miles per sec- 
ond, the earth simply cannot hold 
it. 

(I don’t want anybody to write 
in now to inform me that 5 miles 

GALAXY 



per second is the "circular veloc- 
ity” and that the earth could 
hold a body moving that fast. 
Circular velocity is a theoretical 
figure calculated fo rsea level; 
our discussion concerns a body 
moving with' that velocity at a 
considerable distance from the 
earth where earth’s gravitational 
pull is weaker.) 

If a body like Icarus passed the 
earth at a distance of our natural 
moon, it would have to move 
(relative to the earth) with a ve- 
locity of less than 0.6 miles per 
second to become a satellite. 

Does all this mean that the 
earth could never “capture” an- 
other body and make it a satel- 
lite? It does mean just that. Or 
it does, let’s say, in 999 out of 
1000 cases. For the thousandth 
case, one may invent a complicat- 
ed maneuver in which the moon 
cooperates with the earth. If the 
body, which should be far smaller 
than the moon, is first whipped 
around the moon by the moon’s 
gravitational field it might ac- 
quire a new orbit in which it is 
very slow relative to the earth 1 . 
And having been slowed by our 
moon, the body would, of course, 
be inside the earth’s zone of ac- 
tion. Since the moon’s zone of ac- 
tion is only about one per cent 
of that of the earth, it does not 
need any long explanations to 
show how rare such an event 
would be. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



THE PHASES OF 
THE MOON 

I never thought that I would 
have to devote space in my 
column to a theme as simple as 
that of the phases of the moon, 
but one can never think of all 
the possibilities. One of my read- 
ers asked a fairly simple ques- 
tion, and I gave a simple answerr 
which only resulted in confusion. 
Now if one reader can be con- 
fused about something, others are 
likely to be confused too, so I had 
better explain in public. 

To begin at the beginning, the 
reader in question had checked 
the phases of the moon in an 
almanac. The table there said 
“first quarter,” but the actual 
moon in the sky, I was informed 
with some indignation, was clear- 
ly a half moon. I replied that 
that was as it should be and that 
the “last quarter” was the other 
half of that half moon. 

I still think that this was a sim- 
ple answer, but the reply I re- 
ceived made me realize that we 
simply were talking about two 
different things. My correspond- 
ent meant the appearance of the 
moon in the sky; I was (more or 
less) talking about the calen- 
dar. A long time ago, a rabbi 
wrote in a book called the Mid- 
rash that “the moon had been 
created for the counting of the 
days” and the terms “first quar- 

191 



ter” and “last quarter” may be 
called tfie remains of tHat reason- 
ing. 

Fact is tSat all early calen- 
dars were lunar calendars. They 
originated in the areas we now 
call the Near East where tEe 
seasons are relatively unimpor- 
tant. On tfie other hand, tEe moon 
is a relatively impressive object, 
or was in tEe days before arti- 
ficial light and equally artificial 
air pollution. And the moon does 
display a pronounced periodicity. 

Starting with a nigEt when 
there was no moon in the sky 
(later called “new moon”) the 
cycle went through the barely 
visible crescent that grew wider 
and wider to the point where the; 
moon looked Eke one half of a 
wheel. This marked tEe comple- 
tion of the first quarter of the 
cycle. Then the moon went 
through gibbous (the word means 
“lop-sided”) to full, which marks 
the Half-way point in the cycle. 
Then waning, the Half moon 
phase was reached again; three 
quarters of the cycle Had passed, 
hence the “last quarter” was 
reached. And then back to invisi- 
biHty when a “new moon” would 
be born. 

One may wonder why the an- 
cient people of the Near East 
used the absence of the moon as 
the starting point of the netv cy- 
cle. Why not the full moon which 
is easier to see? 

192 



I don’t know the answer to that 
question, but I have two guesses. 
One is that the re-appearance of 
the moon could be used as a sub- 
ject for mystical speculations, 
something the ancients loved to 
do. The other is that, without in- 
struments, it is not easy to say 
at what moment the moon is full, 
being a precise circle. It was easi- 
er to watch for the disappearance 
of the last thin sliver of the wan- 
ing crescent. From past experi- 
ence tliey knew how much time 
would elapse until the new cres- 
cent Had to appear. 

THE CUD- CHEWING 
RABBIT OF LEVITICUS 

XT' or a complete change of pace 
I am going to end this col- 
umn with a reply to a letter from 
a reader in Oklahoma who wants 
to know why the rabbit is called 
a cud-chewing animal in the Bi- 
ble, referring to Leviticus xi:5. 
Actually the answer is simple; the 
rabbit of Leviticus isn’t a rabbit 
at all. 

The verse says that the zaphan 
(or s aplian is another transHtera- 
tion) must not be eaten even 
though it is a cud-chewer, because 
it does not have the acceptable 
kind of cloven hooves. Even if 
the Christian translators of the 
Bible did not consider this a logi- 
cal piece of reasoning, they were 
still confronted with the problem 

GALAXY 



of translating it. Since the next 
verse said the same about the 
Kare, there was a suggestion that 
the zaphan was fairly small and 
furry. The prudent thing would 
have been to leave the word un- 
translated, maybe with a hint 
that it does not occur in Europe. 

Dr. Martin Luther, who trans- 
lated the Pentateuch around the 
year 1530, was not so prudent 
He seems to have assumed that 
since verse 6 spoke of the Hare, 
verse 5 must mean the rabbit; he 
put Kaninchen (the German 
word for rabbit) into his transla- 
tion. Since he lived close to na- 
ture, in small towns where a 15- 
minute walk would get a man 
out into the fields, he should have 
known that neither the rabbit nor 
its close relative the hare ever 
chews the cud. Either he didn’t 
know it, which would be quite 
strange, or else he succumbed to 
the translator’s syndrome which 
reads: “It doesn’t make sense — 
in fact I don’t believe it — but 
I’m not writing this, I am only 
the translator.” 

The English' translators who 
produced the King James version 
of the Bible, first published in 
1611, also did not know the 
meaning of zaphan. So they fol- 
lowed Luther, using the word 
coney for rabbit. Meanwhile a 
German pastor, Hermann Hein- 
rich Frey, had written a book on 
the animals mentioned in the Bi- 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



ble, which had been published in 
1595. He took no stand on the 
question of whether rabbits and 
hares are cud-chewers, but just 
declared that “they are clean 
to Christians and very good to 
eat.” It is presumed that his cook 
was good at preparing saddle of 
hare. 

Well, since the zaphan is not a 
rabbit, what is it? 

It is an animal that, in modern 
zoology books, goes under the 
name of hyrax. It is about a 
foot long, looks fat and fuzzy and 
stares at people with an expres- 
sion of mild disgust and annoy- 
ance. But it looks at zebras, an- 
telopes and even trees with the 
same expression. Because of its 
general appearance it was, at 
first, thought to be a rodent like 
the rabbit. But a closer look at 
the teeth made it clear that it 
was not. The great Cuvier de- 
clared that it was a primitive 
ungulate or hoofed mammal, and 
we still agree with 1 the statement. 
Because of a fossil found in 
Egypt — long after Cuvier’s 
death — we know that the hyrax 
is distantly related to mastodons 
and elephants, without being a di- 
rect ancestor. 

If it had evolved it would have 
hooves; it might even be cloven- 
hoofed. 

But it did not evolve. And if 
does not chew the cud.

Robert BlocH is famous in that 
Great Big World Out There as 
tHe author of that mean and 
creepy story called Psycho, but in 
real life BlocH Has tHe heart of 
a fan. (He keeps it in his desk 
drawer.) When Alfred Hitchcock 
made Psycho a by-word for Hor- 
ror and sEock, the movie offers 
came flooding in. BlocH moved 
His activities from Wisconsin to 
California, where He Has been 
writing any number of top TV 
shows and motion pictures ever 
since; but still 1 He returns to us 
when he can — as in How Like A 
God, Herewith. 

James E. Gunn is an English 
professor at tHe University of 
Kansas. Witch Hunt, in this issue 
of Galaxy is a sort of follow-up 
story — - not so mucH a sequel as 
a logical consequence — to Trial 
by Fire, wKich appeared in our 
companion magazine. If, a couple 
of months ago.

Do you have a restless urge to write? 



If so, you have much in common 
with successful authors. 

Read how 1 2 Famous Writers are 
helping people turn a restless urge for 
self-expression into success in writing 

The. c's something different about people who 
feel the urge to write. They have a spiritual 
hunger that sets them apart - even from family 
and friends. 

If you have known this burning need to write, 
you, too, may have the gift successful authors 
possess . the recurring ache to put into words 
your innermost thoughts, your ow n experiences. 

Max Shulman started writing because “. it 
was write or bust.” Faith Baldwin, after 80 
novels, still says: "I've never written exactly 
what I dreamed I'd write . you keep on try- 
ing.” Successful authors like these know that 
this restless urge for self-expression is perhaps 
the most important ingredient of writing suc- 
cess. But, they realize it can waste away if you 
don't know how to get started writing, or if you 
hesitate to try. 

Several years ago they joined forces with 
Rod Sel ling. Bennett Ccrf, Bruce Catton, Mig- 
non G. Eberhart, John Caples, J. D. Ratcliff, 
Mark Wiseman, Rudolf Flesch, Red Smith and 
Bergen Evans, to form the Famous Writers 
School. They poured everything they knew 
about writing into a remarkable new kind of 
professional training course which trains you 
at home in your spare time. You begin with 
the fundamentals of all good writing — then 
specialize in Fiction. Non-Fiction, Advertising 
Writing or Business Writing. 

Each of your assignments is examined by an 
instructor who is a professional writer or editor. 

He goes oxer your work line by line, word by 
word, blue-penciling his changes right on your 
manuscript, much as an editor docs with an 
established author. Then he returns it with a 
long letter of advice and guidance. 

This training works well. Our students have 
sold their writing to the Render's Digest, 




Rod Serltng s luge to write made him a 
leading TV dramatist (Twilight 7. one, Patients, 
Requiem for a Heavyweight) and won him 
six Emmy awards. 



Ladies' Home Journal, Fantasy and .Science Fic- 
tion, and more than 100 other publications.
