IT DOESN’T TAKE A GENIUS 



to figure out how much you hate miss- 
ing the best story of your favorite writer 
or the major part of a great novel. But 
we can't compute a formula to stock 
every newsstand in the country with 
enough copies of our popular magazines 
to satisfy every reader. So we some- 
times miss you and you miss us — and 
that’s a double tragedy. 

BUT THERE’S AN ANSWER. 

It doesn’t take a genius to handle it, 
either. All it takes is a minute of your 
time, for which we want to repay you 
with a handsome saving over the news- 
stand price. Just fill in the coupon — 
or write the information on a piece of 
plain paper — and mail it to us. Then 
you’ll be sure instead of sorry.

THE RARIES 



The Raries are in many respects 
remarkably human. In appearance, 
size, occupation, intelligence and 
standard behavior they are indis- 
tinguishable from people. Their 
complexions range the gamut of 
human coloration and they do not 
vote as a block. The one thing that 
sets them apart is that they’re just 
a little better. 

The Raries began to develop 
their own planetary organization 
eleven years ago — in 1959. Its 
founder is Dr. Leonard M. Eisen- 
berg, who is also the president of 
the Associated Health Foundation. 
It is called the National Rare 
Blood Club and its address is 164 
Fifth Avenue, New York City 
10010, tel. 212-CH 3-8037. Its 
relevance to readers of this par- 
ticular issue of Galaxy is that Mr. 
Robert A. Heinlein, whose break- 
through novel, / Will Fear No Evil, 
is currently being serialized here, 
is a Rarie — and so may you be. 
Should you qualify, you could not 
possibly find yourself in better 
company. 

The Rare Blood Club is perva- 
sively featured in the novel — and, 
incidentally, should you run into 
any scuttlebutt that the serializa- 
tion is in any way condensed or al- 
tered pay no attention. The oppor- 
tunity of presenting this remark- 
able novel exactly as Mr. Heinlein 
wrote it — plus Jack Gaughan’s il- 
lustrations — ranks with the hap- 
piest professional experiences I’ve 



known. Mr. Heinlein’s major char- 
acters in the novel all exemplify 
the life-giving generousness of 
Raries. 

The Raries’ Club is one of the 
most exclusive — only an estimated 
25% of the population meets mem- 
bership requirements, which have 
nothing to do with ethnics or socio- 
economic standards. 

In this case blood will tell. If 
you’re 18-65 and one of the .6% of 
the population with AB Rh-Nega- 
tive blood; of the 1.5% with B Rh- 
Negative; the 3.4% with AB Rh- 
Positive', the 6.15% with A Rh- 
Negative\ the 6.75% with O Rh- 
Negative\ the 8.5% with B Rh-Pos- 
itive — and in addition are ready to 
drop whatever you’re doing, wher- 
ever you may be, to save the life 
of someone you do not know, who 
may belong to any ethnic or social 
class and may not even be a regis- 
tered member of the Club — or of 
Raries — you may apply for mem- 
bership. 

Do so. The life your blood do- 
nation will save may one day save 
yours. Or that of a member of 
your family. Or that of a perfect 
stranger. At no cost other than the 
hospital administration charge. 

Raries are remarkable. Many 
have traveled considerable dis- 
tances by the fastest possible trans- 
portation at their own expense, 
leaving businesses dangling, to save, 
a life. Waitresses have answered 
calls for donors without waiting 
for the tip. In 1 1 years 7,000 Rar- 
ies have donated 10,000 pints of 
blood for no other reason than 
that they’re Raries. 

Love ’em. — JAKOBSSON

JAMES BLISH 

"Nobody can lick the United 
States," General McKnight 
said. "Not in the long run " 




T he Fall of God put Theron 
Ware in a peculiarly unenviable 
position, though he was hardly 
alone. After all, he had caused it — 
insofar as an event so gigantic 
could be said to have had any 
cause but the First. And as a black 
magician he knew better than to 
expect any gratitude from the vic- 
tor. 

Nor, on the other hand, would it 
do him the slightest good to main- 
tain that he had loosed the forty- 
eight suffragen demons upon the 
world only at the behest of a client. 
Hell was an incombustible Alex- 
andrine library of such evasions — 
and besides, even had he had a per- 
fect plea of innocence, there was 
no longer any such thing as justice 
anywhere. The Judger was dead. 

“When the hell is he coming 
back?” Baines, the client, de- 
manded suddenly, irritably. “This 
waiting is worse than getting it 
over with.” 

Father Domenico turned from 
the refectory window, which was 
now unglazed from the shock wave 
of the H-bombing of Rome. He 
had been looking down the cliff 
face, over the half-melted pensioni, 
shops and tenements of what had 
once been Positano, at the drained 
sea bed. When that tsunami did ar- 
rive it was going to be a record 
one; it might even reach all the 
way up here. 

“You don’t know what you’re 
saying. Mister Baines,” the white 
magician said. “From now on, 
nothing can be over with. We are 
on the brink of eternity.” 

“You know what I mean,” 
Baines growled. 

“Of course, but if I were you. 



I’d be grateful for the respite . 
It is odd that he hasn’t come back 
yet. Dare we hope that something 
has after all interfered with him? 
Something — or some One?” 

“He said God is dead.” 

“Yes, but he is the Father of 
Lies. What do you think. Doctor 
Ware?” 

Ware did not reply. The person- 
age they were talking about was of 
course not the Father of Lies, the 
ultimate Satan, but the subsidiary 
prince who had answered Ware’s 
last summons — PUT SATANA- 
CHIA, sometimes called Bapho- 
met, the Sabbath Goat. As for the 
question. Ware simply did not 
know the answer; it was now sul- 
len full morning of the day after 
Armageddon, and the Goat had 
promised to come for the four of 
them promptly at dawn, in ironical 
obedience to the letter of Ware’s 
loosing and sending; yet he was not 
here. 

Baines looked around the spent 
conjuring room. “1 wonder what 
he did with Hess?” 

“Swallowed him,” Ware said, 
“as you saw. And it served the fool 
right for stepping outside his cir- 
cle.” 

“But did he really eat him?” 
Baines said. “Or was that, uh, just 
symbolical? Is Hess actually in 
Hell now?” 

Ware refused to be drawn into 
the discussion, which he recognized 
at once as nothing but Baines’ last 
little vestige of skepticism floun- 
dering about for an exit from its 
doom; but Fr. Domenico said, 
“The thing that called itself Screw- 
tape let slip to Lewis that demons 
do eat souls. But one can hardly 



6 



GALAXY 




suppose that that is the end. I ex- 
pect we will shortly know a lot 
more about the matter than we 
wish.” 

Abstractedly he brushed from 
his robe a little more of the dust 
from his shattered crucifix. Ware 
watched him with ironic wonder. 

He really was staging a remark- 
able recovery; his God was dead, 
his Christ exploded as a myth, his 
soul assuredly as damned as that 
of Ware or Baines — and he could 
still manage to interest himself in 
semischolastic prattle. Well, Ware 
had always thought that white 
magic, these days as always, at- 
tracted only a low order of intel- 
lect, let alone insight. 

But where was the Goat? 

“I wonder where Mister Gins- 
berg went?” Father Domenico 
said, as if in parody of Ware’s un- 
spoken question. Again Ware only 
shrugged. He had for the moment 
quite forgotten Baines’ male secre- 
tary;- it was true that Ginsberg had 
shown some promise as an appren- 
tice, but after all, he had wanted to 
learn the Ars Magica essentially as 
a means of supplying himself with 
mistresses, and even under normal 
circumstances his recent experience 
with Ware’s assistant, Gretchen — 
who was in fact a succubus — had 
probably driven the desire out per- 
manently. In any event, of what 
use would an apprentice be now? 

Baines looked as startled as 
Ware felt at the question. “Jack?” 
he said. “I sent him to our rooms 
to pack.” 

“To pack?” Ware said. “You 
had some notion that you might 
get away?” 

“1 thought it highly unlikely,” 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



Baines said evenly, “but if the op- 
portunity arose, I didn’t mean to 
be caught unprepared.” 

“Where do you think you might 
go where the Goat couldn’t find 
you?” 

No reply was necessary. Ware 
felt through his sandals a slow 
shuddering of the tiled floor. As it 
grew more pronounced, it was 
joined by a faint but deep thunder 
in the air. 

Fr. Domenico shuffled hastily 
back to the window, Baines close 
behind him. Unwillingly, Ware fol- 
lowed. 

On the horizon a wall of foam- 
ing, cascading water was coming 
toward them, with preternatural 
slowness, across the deserted floor 
of the Tyrrhenian Sea. The water 
had all been drained away as one 
consequence of the Corinth earth- 
quake of yesterday, which itself 
might or might not have been de- 
monically created; Ware was not 
sure that it made much difference 
one way or the other. In any event, 
the tectonic imbalance was now, 
inexorably, in the process of right- 
ing itself. 

The Goat remained unaccount- 
ably delayed . but the tsunami 
was on its way at last. 

I 

T he enemy, whoever he was, had 
obviously been long prepared to 
make a major attempt to reduce 
the Strategic Air Command’s mas- 
ter missile-launching control site 
under Denver. In the first twenty 
minutes of the war he had dumped 
a whole stick of multiple hydrogen 
warheads on it. The city, of course, 

7 




had been utterly vaporized and a 
vast expanse of the plateau on 
which it had stood was now nothing 
but gullied, vitrified and radioac- 
tive granite; but the site had been 
well hardened and was more than 
a mile beneath the original surface. 
Everybody in it had been knocked 
down and temporarily deafened, 
there were bruises and scrapes and 
one concussion, some lights had 
gone out and a lot of dust had 
been raised despite the air-condi- 
tioning; in short, the damage would 
have been reported as “minimal” 
had there been anybody to report 
it to. 

Who the enemy was occasioned 
some debate. General D. Willis 
McKnight, a Yellow Peril fan 
since his boyhood reading of The 
American Weekly in Chicago, fa- 
vored the Chinese. Of his two chief 
scientists, one, the Prague-born 
Dr. Dzejms Satvje, the godfather 
of the selenium bomb, had been 
seeing Russians under his bed for 
almost as long 

“Wm, why argue?” said Johann 
Buelg. As a RAND Corporation 
alumnus, he found nothing un- 
thinkable, but he did not like to 
waste time speculating about facts. 
“We can always ask the computer 
— we must have enough input al- 
ready for that. Not that it matters 
much, since we’ve already plastered 
the Russians and the Chinese pret- 
ty thoroughly.” 

“We already know the Chinese 
started it,” Gen. McKnight said, 
wiping dust off his spectacles with 
his handkerchief. He was a small, 
narrow-chested Air Force Acade- 
my graduate from the class just 
after the cheating had been 

8 



stopped, already nearly bald at 
forty-eight; naked, his face looked 
remarkably like that of a prawn. 
“They dropped a thirty-megaton- 
ner on Formosa, disguised as a 
test.” 

“It depends on what you mean 
by ‘start,’ ” Buelg said. “That was 
already on Rung twenty-one. Level 
Four — local nuclear war. But still 
only Chinese against Chinese.” 

“But we were committed to 
them, right?” Satvje said. “Presi- 
dent Agnew told the UN, ‘I am a 
Formosan.’ ” 

“It doesn’t matter worth a 
damn,” Buelg said, with some irri- 
tation. It was his opinion, which he 
did not keep particularly private, 
that Satvje, whatever his eminence 
as a physicist, in all other matters 
had a goyische kopf. He had en- 
countered better heads on egg 
creams in his father’s candy store. 
“The thing’s escalated almost ex- 
ponentially in the past eighteen 
hours or so. The question is, how 
far has it gone? If we’re lucky, it’s 
only up to Level Six, central war 
— maybe no farther than Rung 
thirty-four, constrained disarming 
attack.” 

“Do you call atomizing Denver 
restrained?” the general demanded. 

“Maybe. They could have done 
for Denver with one warhead — in- 
stead they saturated it. That means 
they were shooting for us, not for 
the city proper. Our counter-strike 
couldn’t be preventive, so it was 
one rung lower, which I hope to 
God they noticed.” 

“They took out Washington,” 
Satvje said, clasping his fat hands 
piously. He had been lean once, 
but becoming first a consultant on 

GALAXY 




the Cabinet level, next a spokes- 
man for massive retaliation, and 
finally a publicity-saint had ap- 
pended a beer-belly to his brain- 
puffed forehead, so that he now 
looked like a caricature of a 
XlXth-century German philolo- 
gist. Buelg himself was stocky and 
tended to run to lard but a terrible 
susceptibility to kidney stones had 
kept him on a reasonable diet. 

“The Washington strike almost 
surely wasn’t directed against ci- 
vilians,” Buelg said. “Naturally 
the leadership of the enemy is a 
prime military target. But, Gener- 
al, all this happened so quickly 
that 1 doubt that anybody in gov- 
ernment had a chance to reach pre- 
pared shelters. You may now be 
effectively the President of what- 
ever is left on the United States, 
which means that you could make 
new policies.” 

“True,” McKnight said. “True, 
true.” 

“In which case we’ve got to ' 
know the facts the minute our ' 
lines to outside are restored. ' 
Among other things, if the escala- : 
tion’s gone all the way to spasm, i 
in which case the planet will be un- 
inhabitable. There’ll be nobody i 
and nothing left alive but people in i 
hardened sites, like us, and the I 
only policy we’ll need for that will i 
be a count of the canned beans.” ( 

“I think that needlessly pessimis- ( 
tic,” Satvje said, at last heaving < 
himself up out of the chair into : 
which he had struggled after get- I 
ting up off the floor. It was not a i 
very comfortable chair but the s 
computer room — where they had i 
all been when the strike had come ' 

had not been designed for com- ( 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



fort. He put his thumbs under the 
lapels of his insignia-less advisor’s 
uniform and frowned down upon 
them. “The Earth is a large planet, 
of its class; if we cannot reoccupy 
it, our descendants will be able to 
do so.” 

“After five thousand years?” 
“You are assuming that carbon 
bombs were used. Dirty bombs of 
that kind are obsolescent. That is 
why I so strongly advocated the 
sulfur-decay chain; the selenium 
isotopes are chemically all strong- 
ly poisonous, but they have very 
short half-lives. A selenium bomb 
is essentially a humane bomb.” 

S ATJVE was physically unable to 
pace, but he was beginning to 
stump back and forth. He was 
again playing back one of his pop- 
ular magazine articles. Buelg be- 
gan to twiddle his thumbs. 

“It has sometimes occurred to 
me,” §atjve said, “that our dis- 
covery of how to release the nu- 
clear energies was providential. 
Consider: Natural selection 

stopped for Man when he achieved 
control over his environment — and 
furthermore began to save the lives 
of all his weaklings and preserve 
their bad genes. Once natural se- 
lection has been halted the only re- 
maining pressure upon the race to 
evolve is mutation. Artificial ra- 
dioactivity and, indeed, even fall- 
out Itself, may be God’s way of re- 
suming the process of evolution 
for Man — perhaps toward some 
ultimate organism we cannot fore- 
see, perhaps even toward some 
unitary mind which we will share 
with God, as Teilhardt de Chardin 
envisioned — ” 



9 




At this point, the general no- 
ticed the twiddling of Buelg’s 
thumbs. 

“Facts are what we need,” he 
said. “I agree with you there, 
Buelg. But a good many of our 
lines to outside were cut, and there 
may have been some damage to 
the computer circuitry, too.” He 
jerked his head toward the techni- 
cians who were scurrying around 
and up and down the face of 
RANDOMAC. “I’ve got them 
working on it. Naturally.” 

“I see that, but we’ll need some 
sort of rational schedule of ques- 
tions. Is the escalation still going 
on, presuming we haven’t reached 
the insensate stage already? If it’s 
over- or at least suspended some- 
how — is the enemy sane enough 
not to start it again? And then, 
what’s the extent of the exterior 
damage? For that, we’ll need a 
visual readout — I assume there 
are still some satellites up, but 
we’ll want a closer look, if any 
local television survived. 

“And if you’re now the Presi- 
dent, General, are you prepared to 
negotiate, if you’ve got any oppo- 
site numbers in the Soviet Union 
or the People’s Republic?” 

“There ought to be whole sets 
of such courses of action already 
programed into the computer,” 
McKnight said, “according to 
what the actual situation is. Is the 
machine going to be useless to us 
for anything but gaming, now that 
we really need it? Or have you 
been misleading me again?” 

“Of course 1 haven’t been mis- 
leading you. I wouldn’t play games 
with my own life included among 
the stakes. And there are indeed 

10 



such alternative courses; I wrote 
most of them myself, though I 
didn’t do the actual programing. 
But no program can encompass 
what a specific leader might decide 
to do. War gaming actual past 
battles — for example, rerunning 
Waterloo without allowing for 
Napoleon’s piles or the heroism 
of the British squares — has pro- 
duced ‘predicted’ outcomes com- 
pletely at variance with history. 
Computers are rational; people 
aren’t. Look at Agnew. That’s 
why I asked you my question — 
which, by the way, you haven’t yet 
answered.” 

McKnight pulled himself up and 
put his glasses back on. 

“1,” he said, “am prepared to 
negotiate. With anybody. Even 
Chinks.”

R ome was no more, nor was 
Milan. Neither were London, 
Paris, Berlin, Bonn, Tel Aviv, Cai- 
ro, Riyadh, Stockholm and a 
score of lesser cities. But these 
were of no immediate concern. As 
the satellites showed, their deaths 
had expectably laid out long, cigar- 
shaped, overlapping paths of fall- 
out to the east — the direction in 
which, thanks to the rotation of 
the Earth, the weather inevitably 
moved — and though these unfor- 
tunately lay across once-friendly 
terrain, they ended in enemy coun- 
try. Similarly, the heavy toll in the 
U.S.S.R. had sown its seed across 
Siberia and China; that in China 
across Japan, Korea and Taiwan; 
and the death of Tokyo was poi- 
soning only a swath of the Pacific 

GALAXY 




(although, later, some worry would 
have to be devoted to the fish). 
Honolulu somehow had been 
spared, so that no burden of di- 
rect, heavy-nuclei fallout would 
reach the west coast of the United 
States. 

This was fortunate, for Los An- 
geles, San Francisco, Portland, 
Seattle and Spokane had all been 
hit, as had Denver, St. Louis, Min- 
neapolis, Chicago, New Orleans, 
Clevelaitd, Detroit and Dallas. 
Under the circumstances it really 
hardly mattered that Pittsburgh, 
Philadelphia, New York, Syra- 
cuse, Boston, Toronto, Baltimore 
and Washington had all also got- 
ten it, for even without the bombs, 
the eastern third of the continental 
United States would have been un- 
inhabitable in its entirety for at 
least fifteen years to come. At the 
moment, in any event, it consisted 
of a single vast forest fire through 
which, from the satellites, the slag 
pits of the bombed cities were in- 
visible except as high spots in the 
radiation contours. The northwest 
was in much the same shape, al- 
though the west coast in general 
had taken far fewer missiles. In- 
deed, the sky all over the world 
was black with smoke, for the for- 
ests of Europe and northern Asia 
were burning, too. Out of the pall, 
more death fell, gently, invisibly, 
inexorably. 

All this, of course, came from 
the computer analysis. Though 
there were television cameras in 
the satellites, even on a clear day 
you could hardly have told from 
visual sightings, from that height 
— or from photographs, for that 
matter — whether or not there was 



intelligent life on Earth. The view 
over Africa, South America, Aus- 
tralia and the American southwest 
was better, but of no strategic or 
logistic interest. 

Of the television cameras on the 
Earth’s surface, most of the sur- 
viving ones were in areas where 
nothing seemed to have happened 
at all, although in towns the streets 
were deserted and the very few 
people glimpsed briefly on the 
screen looked haunted. The views 
from near the bombed areas were 
fragmentary, traveling, scarred by 
rasters, aflicker with electronic 
snow — a procession of uncon- 
nected images, like scenes from an 
early Surrealist film, where one 
could not tell whether the director 
was trying to portray a story or 
only a state of mind. 

Here stood a single telephone 
pole, completely charred; here was 
a whole row of them, snapped off 
at ground level but still linked in 
death by their wires. Here was a 
desert of collapsed masonry, in the 
midst of which stood a reinforced- 
concrete smoke stack, undamaged 
except that its surface was etched 
by heat and by the sand-blasting of 
debris carried by a high wind. Here 
buildings all leaned sharply in a 
single direction, as if struck, like 
the chimney, by some hurricane of 
terrific proportions; here was what 
had been a group of manufactur- 
ing buildings, denuded of roofing 
and siding, nothing but twisted 
frames. Here a row of wrecked

Buelg agreed. “There seems to be 
some missing factor. We’re going 
to have to ask the computer to 
scan for an anomaly. Luckily it’s 
likely to be a big one — but since I 
can’t tell the machine what kind of 
anomaly to look for, it’s going to 
cost us some time.” 

“How much time?” McKnight 
said, running a finger around the 
inside of his collar. “If the Chinks 
start up on us again — ” 

“It may be as much as an hour, 
after I formulate the question and 
Chief Hay programs it, which will 
take, oh, say two hours at a mini- 
mum. But I don’t think we need to 
worry about the Chinese; accord- 
ing to our data, that opening Tai- 
wan bomb was the biggest one they 
used, so it was probably the big- 
gest one they had. As for anyone 
else, well, you just finished saying 
yourself that somehow everything’s 
now stopped short. We badly need 
to find out why.” 

“All right. Get on it, then.” 

T he two hours for programing, 
however, stretched to four; and 
then the computer ran for ninety 
minutes without producing any- 
thing at all. Chief Hay had 
thoughtfully forbidden the ma- 
chine to reply DATA INSUFFI- 
CIENT, since new data were com- 
ing in at an increasing rate as com- 
munications with the outside im- 
proved; as a result, the computer 
was recycling the problem once 
every three or four seconds. 

McKnight used the time to issue 
orders that repairs to the keep be 
made, stores assessed, order re- 
stored, and then settled down to a 
telecommunications search — again 

14 



via the computer, but requiring 
only about two percent of its ca- 
pacity — for any superiors who 
might have survived him. Buelg 
suspected that he really wanted to 
find some; he had the capacity to 
be a general officer, but would find 
it most uncomfortable to be a pres- 
ident, even over so abruptly simpli- 
fied a population and economy — 
and foreign policy, for that matter 
— as the TV screen had shown now 
existed outside. Ordering junior 
officers to order non commis- 
sioned officers to order rankers to 
replace broken fluorescent bulbs 
was the type of thing he didn’t 
mind doing on his own, but for or- 
dering them to arm missiles and 
aim them — or put a state under 
martial law — he much preferred to 
be acting upon higher authority. 

As for Buelg’s own preference, 
he rather hoped that McKnight 
wouldn’t be able to find any such 
person. The United States under a 
McKnight regime wouldn’t be run 
very imaginatively or even flexibly, 
but on the other hand it would be 
unlikely to be a tyranny. Besides, 
McKnight was quite dependent up- 
on his civilian experts, and hence 
would be easy to manage. Of 
course, that meant that something 
would have to be done about Sat- 
vje. 

The computer rang its bell and 
began to print out its analysis. 
Buelg read it with intense concen- 
tration and, after the first fold, 
utter incredulity. When it was all 
out of the printer, he tore it off, 
tossed it onto the desk and beck- 
oned to Chief Hay. 

“Run the question again.” 

Hay turned to the input key- 

GALAXY 




board. It took him ten minutes to 
retype the program; the question 
had been in the normal order of 
things too specialized to tape. Two 
and a half seconds after he had fin- 
ished the machine chimed and the 
long thin slabs of metal began to 
rise against the paper. The print- 
ing-out process never failed to re- 
mind Buelg of a player piano run- 
ning in reverse, converting notes 
into punches instead of the other 
way around, except, of course, 
that what one got here was not 
punches but lines of type. But he 
saw almost at once that the analy- 
sis itself was going to be the same. 

At the same time he became 
aware that Satvje was standing just 
behind him. 

“About time,” the Czech said. 
“Let’s have a look.” 

“There’s nothing to see yet.” 

“What do you mean, there’s 
nothing to see? It’s printing, isn’t 
it? And you’ve already got another 
copy out on the bench. The general 
should have been notified imme- 
diately.” 

He picked up the long, wide ac- 
cordian-fold of paper with its 
sprocket-punched edges and began 
to read it. There was nothing Buelg 
could do to prevent him. 

“The machine’s printing non- 
sense, that’s what I mean, and I 
didn’t propose to distract the gen- 
eral with a lot of garbage. The 
bombing must have jarred some- 
thing loose.” 

Hay turned from the keyboard. 
“I ran a test program through 
promptly after the attack. Doctor 
Buelg. The computer was func- 
tioning perfectly then.” 

“Well, clearly it isn’t now. Run

WITH THE June sales conference 
over (at which the entire Fall list is 
presented), the dog days of summer 
are here to confront us with various 
crises ignored in the excitement of 
preparing for that semi-annual holo- 
caust. Everyone is feeling dragged 
out— in a triumphant sort of way— 
when the call comes for copy for what 
we laughingly call an ad. Well okay, 
it just so happens that our July list is 
one of the best we've had this year. 
First and foremost. Bob Silverberg 
has edited a volume titled, very ac- 
curately, GREAT SHORT NOVELS 
OF SCIENCE FICTION. And the ros- 
ter of writers includes Bertram 
Chandler, Kornbluth, Jack Vance, 
Charles DeVet and Katherine Mac- 
Lean, Wyman Guin and Roger Zelaz- 
ny. Really topflight, if we do say so 
ourselves. 



THIS MONTH sees also two Adult 
Fantasies— one, by George Mere- 
dith, will be known to some. Surely 
THE SHAVING OF SHAGPAT is 
dearly loved by a small, select group. 
Such wily sensuality and humor, such 
richness of imagery— as Francis 
Meynell says, "More than a hundred 
thousand words of coruscating fan- 
tasy, a dizzy riot of magic . ." Per- 
haps now a larger select group will

AND THE second fantasy is a truly 
remarkable find from Lin Carter, a 
magnificent work originally titled 
The Virgin and the Swine (which may 
well be why the book has been a well- 
kept secret for some thirty years). 
We have re-titled it, with much great- 
er accuracy and appropriateness, 
THE ISLAND OF THE MIGHTY. It 
is by a delightfui lady named Evange- 
line Walton, and the subject matter 
is based in early Welsh mythology 
when bloodlines were established by 
maternal continuity since only the 
mother of a child could be known for 
sure. Incest was the accepted way of 
keeping things in the famiiy, mar- 
riage not yet invented since no one 
believed one could so clearly fiy in 
the face of nature without dire re- 
sults. At the same time, there were 
men and women of vast powers, dis- 
ciplined and educated in sorcery and 
magic, who ruled the land. The hero 
and herione of the tale, if indeed they 
can be so called, are two such. A 
brother and sister, deeply committed 
to one another, although she has re- 
fused to bear him a nephew. She is, 
in fact, a bitch of the first water, un- 
forgivably selfish, savage in her ha- 
treds. Her brother, at first a reckless 
young man, emerges as figure of 
truly heroic stature in a book that 
moves steadily to a towering climax. 
Absolutely do not miss this one. BB

your test program again, find out 
where the trouble lies and let us 
know how long it will take to re- 
pair it. If we can’t trust the com- 
puter we’re out of business for 
sure.” 

Hay got to work. Satvje put the 
down readout. 

“What’s nonsense about this?” 

“It’s utterly impossible, that’s 
all. There hasn’t been time. With 
any sort of engineering training, 
you’d know that yourself. And it 
makes no military or political 
sense, either.” 

“I think we should let the gener- 
al be the judge of that.” 

Picking up the bulky strip again, 
Satvje carried it off toward the 
general’s office, a certain subtle 
triumph in his gait, like the school 
trusty bearing the evidence of petty 
theft to the head master. Buelg 
followed, inwardly raging, and not 
only at the waste motion. Satvje 
would, of course, tell McKnight 
that Buelg had been holding back 
on reporting the analysis; all Buelg 
could do now, until the machine 
was repaired, was to be sure to be 
there to explain why, and the pos- 
ture was much too purely defen- 
sive for his liking. It was a damn 
shame that he had ever taught 
Satvje to read a printout, but once 
they had been thrown together on 
this job, he had had no choice in 
the matter. McKnight had been as 
suspicious as a Sealyham of both 
of them, anyhow, at the beginning. 
Satvje, after all, had come from a 
country which had long been Com- 
munist, and had had to explain 
that his ancestry was French, his 
name only a Serbo-Croat trans- 
literation back from the Cyrillic of 

GALAXY 




“Chatvieux”; while Security had 
unfortunately confused Buelg with 
Johann Gottfried Jiilg, a forgotten 
nineteenth-century translator of 
Ardshi Bordschi Khan, the Siddhi 
Kur, the Skaskas and other Rus- 
sian folk tales, so that Buelg, even 
more demeaningly, had had to ad- 
mit that his name was actually a 
Yiddish version of a German word 
for a leather bucket. Under Mc- 
Knight’s eye, the two still possibly 
suspect civilians had to cooperate 
or be downgraded into some unre- 
munerative university post. Buelg 
supposed that Satvje had enjoyed 
it as little as he had, but he didn’t 
care an iota about what Satvje did 
or didn’t enjoy. Damn the man. 

A S FOR the document itself, it 
was no masterpiece of analysis. 
The machine had simply at last 
recognized an anomaly in a late- 
coming piece of new data. It was 
the interpretation that made Buelg 
suspect that the gadget had mal- 
functioned; unlike Satvje, he had 
had enough experience of comput- 
ers at RAND to know that if they 
were not allowed enough warm-up 
time, or had been improperly 
cleared of a previous program, 
they could produce remarkably 
paranoid fantasies. 

Translated from the Fortran, the 
document said that the United 
States had not only been hit by 
missiles, but also deeply invaded. 
This conclusion had been drawn 
from a satellite sighting of some- 
thing in Death Valley, not there 
yesterday, which was not natural, 
and whose size, shape and energy 
output suggested an enormous 
fortress. 



“Which is just plain idiotic,’’ 
Buelg added, after the political 
backing and filling in McKnight’s 
office had been gone through, to 
nobody’s final advantage. “On any 
count you care to name. The air 
drops required to get the materials 
in there, or the sea landings plus 
overland movements, couldn’t 
have gone undetected. Then, stra- 
tegically it’s insane: the building of 
targets like fortresses should have 
become obsolete with the invention 
of the cannon — and the airplane 
made them absurd. Locating such 
a thing in Death Valley means that 
it dominates nothing but utterly 
worthless territory, at the price of 
insuperable supply problems — 
right from the start it’s in a state 
of siege by Nature alone. And as 
for running it up overnight — I ask 
you. General, could we have done 
that, even in peacetime and in the 
most favorable imaginable loca- 
tion? 1 say we couldn’t — and that 
if we couldn’t no human agency 
could.’’ 

McKnight picked up his phone 
and spoke briefly. Since it was a 
Hush-a-Phone, what he said was 
inaudible, but Buelg’s guess about 
the call was promptly confirmed. 

“Chief Hay says the machine is 
in perfect order and has produced 
a third analysis just like this one,’’ 
he reported. “The problem now 
clearly is one of reconnaissance. 
(He pronounced the word correct- 
ly, which, amidst his flat California 
American, sounded almost af- 
fected.) Is there such a thing in 
Death Valley, or isn’t there? For 
the satellite to be able to spot it at 
all it must be gigantic. From twen- 
ty-three thousand miles up, even a 

17 



THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 




city the size of San Antonio is in- 
visible unless you know exactly 
what you’re looking for in ad- 
vance.” 

Here, Buelg was aware, Mc- 
Knight was speaking as an expert. 
Until he had been put in charge of 
SAC in Denver, almost all his ca- 
reer had been spent in various as- 
pects of Air Information; even as 
a teenager, he had been a Civil Air 
Patrol cadet involved in search- 
and-rescue operations, which, be- 
tween the mudslides and the brush- 
fires, had been particularly exten- 
sive in the Los Angeles area in 
those days. 

“I don’t doubt that the satellite 
has spotted something,” Buelg 
said. “But what it probably sees is 
a hard-radiation locus — maybe 
thermally hot, too - rather than 
any optical object, let alone a con- 
struct. My guess is that it’s noth- 
ing more than the impact site of a 
multiple warhead component that 
lost guidance, or was mis-aimed to 
begin with.” 

“Highly likely,” McKnight ad- 
mitted. “But why guess? The obvi- 
ous first step is to send a low-level 
attack bomber over the site and 
get close-in photographs and spec- 
tra. A primitive installation such 
as you suggested earlier would be 
typically Chinese, and if so they 
won’t have low-levcl radar. If, on 
the other hand, the plane gets shot 
down, that will tell us something 
about the enemy, too.” 

Buelg sighed inwardly. Trying to 
nudge McKnight out of his single 
channel was a frustrating opera- 
tion. But maybe in this instance it 
wasn’t really necessary; after all, 
the suggestion itself was sensible. 

18 



“All right,” he said. “One plane 
seems like a small investment. 
We’ve got damn-all else left to 
lose now, anyhow.” 

Ill 

N O ATTACK was made on the 
plane but there was, neverthe- 
less, one casualty. Neither the 
photographer nor the flight engi- 
neer, both busy with their instru- 
ments, had actually seen much of 
the target, and the captain, for the 
same reason, had seen little more. 

“Hell of a lot of turbulence,” 
he said at the debriefing, which 
took place a thousand miles away, 
while the men under Denver 
watched intently. “And the target 
itself is one huge updraft, like 
New York used to be, only much 
worse.” 

But the navigator, once his job 
had been done, had had nothing to 
do but look out and he was in a 
state of shock. He was a swarthy 
young enlisted man from Chicago 
who looked as though he might 
have been recruited straight from 
a Mafiosa family, but he could 
say nothing now but a sentence 
which refused to get beyond its 
first word; “Dis — Dis — ” 

Once he had recovered from his 
shock they would be able to ques- 
tion him. But for the time being he 
was of no help. 

The photographs, however, were 
very clear, except for the infrared- 
sensitive plates, which showed 
nothing intelligible to the eye at 
all. The installation was perfectly 
circular and surrounded by a moat 
which, impossibly for Death Val- 
ley, appeared to be filled with 



GALAXY 




black but genuine water, from 
which a fog bank was constantly 
trying to rise, only to be dissipated 
in the bone-dry air. The construc- 
tion itself was a broad wall, al- 
most a circular city, a good fif- 
teen miles in diameter. It was 
broken irregularly by towers and 
other structures, some of them 
looking remarkably like mosques. 
This shell glowed fiercely, like red- 
hot iron; and a spectrograph 
showed that this was what it was. 

Inside, the ground was terraced, 
like a lunar crater. At ground lev- 
el was a flat plain, dotted with tiny 
rectangular markings in no dis- 
cernible pattern; these, too, the 
spectrograph said, were red-hot 
iron. What seemed to be another 
moat, blood-red and as broad as a 
river, encircled the next terrace at 
the foot of the cliff where it began 
and this, even more impossibly, 
was bordered by a dense circular 
forest. The forest was as broad as 
the river, but thinned eventually to 
a ring of what appeared to be the 
original sand, equally broad. 

In a lunar crater, the foothills 
of the central peak would have be- 
gun about here; but in the pic- 
tures, instead, the terrain plunged 
into a colossal black pit. The river 
cut through the forest and the des- 
ert at one point and roared over 
the side in a vast waterwall, com- 
pounding the darkness with mist 
which the camera had been unable 
to penetrate. 

“What was that you were say- 
ing about building a fortress over- 
night, Buelg?” the general said. 
“No human agency could?” 

“No human agency was in- 
volved,” Satvje said in a hoarse 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



whisper. He turned to the aide 
who had brought the pictures, an 
absurdly young lieutenant-colonel 
with a blond erewcut, white face 
and shaking hands. “Closeups?” 

“Yes, Doctor. There was an 
automatic camera under the plane 
that took a film of the approach 
run. Here is one of the best shots.” 

The picture showed what ap- 
peared to be a towering gate in the 
best rnedieval style. Hundreds of 
shadowy figures crowded the bar- 
bican, of which three, just above 
the gateway itself, had been look- 
ing up at the plane and were 
shockingly clear. They looked like 
gigantie naked women, with ropy 
hair all awry, and the wide-staring 
eyes of insane rage. 

“I thought so,” Satvje said. 

“You recognize them?” Buelg 
asked incredulously. 

“No, but I know their names. 
Alecto, Megaera and Tisiphone,” 
Satvje said. “And it’s a good thing 
that there’s at least one person 
among us with a European educa- 
tion. 1 presume that our distrait 
friend the navigator is a Catholic, 
which does just as well in this con- 
text. In any event, he was quite 
right: this is Dis, the fortress sur- 
rounding Nether Hell. I think we 
must now assume that all the rest 
of the Earth is contiguous with 
Upper Hell, not only in metaphor 
but in fact.” 

“It’s a good thing,” Buelg said 
acidly, “that there’s at least one 
person among us with a good grip 
on his sanity. The last thing we 
need now is a relapse into super- 
stition.” 

“If you blow up that photo- 
graph, I think you’ll find that the 

19 




hair on those women actually con- 
sists of live snakes. Isn’t that so, 
Colonel?” 

“Well — Doctor, . it — it certainly 
looks like it.” 

“Of course. Those are the Fur- 
ies who guard the gates of Dis. 
They are the keepers of the Gor- 
gon Medusa, which, thank God, 
isn’t in the picture. The moat is 
the River Styx; the first terrace in- 
side contains the burning tombs of 
the Heresiarchs, and on the next 
you have the River Phlegethon, 
the Wood of the Suicides, and the 
Abominable Sand. A rain of fire 
is supposed to fall continually on 
the sand, but I suppose that’s in- 
visible in Death Valley sunlight, or 
maybe even superfluous. We can’t 
see what’s down below, but pre- 
sumably that, too, will be exactly 
as Dante described it. The crowd 
along the barbican is made up of 
demons — not so. Colonel?” 

“Sir — we can’t tell what they 
are. We were wondering if they 
were, well, Martians or some- 
thing. Everyone is a different 
shape.” 

Buelg felt his back hairs stir- 
ring. “I refuse to believe this non- 
sense,” he said. “Satvje is inter- 
preting it from his damned obso- 
lete education. Even Martians 
would make more sense.” 

“What are the facts about this 
Dante?” McKnight said. 

“An Italian poet, of about the 
Thirteenth Century — ” 

“Early Fourteenth,” Satvje 
said. “And not just any poet. He 
had a vision of Hell and Heaven 
which became the greatest peom 
ever written — the Divine Comedy. 
What we see in those pictures ex- 

20 



actly corresponds to the descrip- 
tion in Cantos Eight through Elev- 
en of it.” 

“Buelg, see if you can locate a 
copy of the book and have it read 
to the computer. First we need to 
know if the correspondence is all 
that exact. If it is, we’ll need an 
analysis of what it means.” 

“The computer probably al- 
ready has the book,” Buelg said. 
“The whole Library of Congress, 
plus all our recreational library, 
is on microfilm inside it, we didn’t 
have room for books per se down 
here. All we need to do is tell 
Chief Hay to make it part of the 
problem. But I still think it’s damn 
nonsense.” 

“What we want,” McKnight 
said, “is the computer’s opinion. 
Yours has already been shown to 
be somewhat less reliable.” 

“And while you’re at it,” Satvje 
said, perhaps a shade less smugly 
than Buelg might have expected, 
“have Chief Hay make a part of 
the problem everything in the li- 
brary on demonology. We’re go- 
ing to need it.” 

Throwing up his hands, Buelg 
left the office. In the country of 
the mad . nobody retains his 
sanity. 

Only a few moments were need- 
ed for the computer to produce its 
report.

CLUDED WAS ARMAGEDDON IS 0.01 
WITHIN THE SAME CONFIDANCE 
LEVEL. AS A SECOND DERIVATIVE, 
THE PROBABILITY THAT THE FORC- 
ES OF GOD HAVE LOST THE WAR 
AND THAT THE SURFACE OF THE 
EARTH IS NOW CONFLUENT WITH 
UPPER HELL IS 0.001 WITHIN THE 
SAME CONFIDANCE LEVEL. 



W ELL, that clarifies the situa- 
tion considerably,” McKnight 
said. “It’s just as well we asked.” 

“But — my God! It simply can’t 
be true,” Buelg said desperately. 
“All right, maybe the computer is 
functioning properly, but it has no 
intelligence and. above all, no 
judgment. What it’s putting out 
now is just a natural consequence 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



of letting all that medieval super- 
stition into the problem.” 

McKnight turned his shrimp’s 
eyes toward Buelg. “You’ve seen 
the pictures,” he said. “They 
didn’t come out of the computer, 
did they? Or out of the old books? 
I think we’d better stop kicking 
against the pricks and start figur- 
ing out what we’re going to do. 
We’ve still got the United States 
to think of. Doctor Satvje, have 
you any suggestions?” 

That was a bad sign. McKnight 
never used honorifics except to 
indicate, by inversion, which of the 
two of them had incurred his dis- 
pleasure — not that Buelg had been 
in any doubt about that, already. 

“I’m still in a good deal of 
doubt,” Satvje said modestly. “To 
begin with, if this had been Ar- 
mageddon, we all ought to have 
been called to judgment by now; 
and there was certainly nothing in 
the prophecies that allowed for an 
encampment of victorious demons 
on the surface of the Earth. If the 
computer is completely right, then 
either God is dead as Nietzsche 
said or, as the jokes go. He is 
alive but doesn’t want to get in- 
volved. In either case I think we 
would be well advised not to draw 
attention to ourselves. We can do 
nothing against supernatural pow- 
ers; and if He is still alive, the bat- 
tle may not be over. We are, I 
hope, safely hidden here and we 
would be ill advised to be caught 
in the middle.” 

“Now there you’re dead 
wrong,” Buelg said with energy. 
“Let’s suppose for a minute that 
this fantasy represents the true 
state of affairs — in other words. 



21 




that demons have turned out to be 
real and are out there in Death 
Valley^” 

“I’m not too sure what would 
be meant by ‘real’ in this context,” 
Satvje said. “They are apparent, 
true enough; but they certainly 
don’t belong to the same order of 
reality as — ” 

“That’s a question we can’t af- 
ford to debate,” Buelg said. He 
knew very well that the issue 
Satvje was raising was a valid one 
— he was himself a fairly thor- 
ough-going Logical Positivist. But 
it would only confuse McKnight 
and there were brownie points to 
be made in keeping things clear- 
cut, whether they were clear-cut or 
not. “Look. If demons are real, 
then they occupy space/time in the 
real universe. That means that 
they exist inside some energy sys- 
tem in that universe and are main- 
tained by it. All right, they can 
walk on red-hot iron and live com- 
fortably in Death Valley; that’s 
not inherently more supernatural 
than the existence of bacteria in 
the boiling waters of volcanic 
springs. It’s an adaptation. Very 
well, then we can find out what 
that energy system is. We can an- 
alyze how it works. And once we 
know that, we can attack it.” 

“Now that’s more like it,” Mc- 
Knight said. 

“Pardon me, but I think we 
should proceed with the most ex- 
treme caution,” Satvje said. “Un- 
less one has been raised in this tra- 
dition, one is not likely to think of 
all the implications. I myself am 
quite out of practice at it.” 

“Damn your education,” Buelg 
said. But it was all coming back to 

22 



him: The boundaryless ghetto 
along Nostrand Avenue; the fur- 
hatted, fur-faced, maxi-skirted 
Hassidim walking in pairs under 
the scaling elm saplings of Grand 
Central Parkway; the terror of 
riding the subway among the ju- 
venile gangs under the eternal 
skullcap; the endless hairsplitting 
over the Talmudic and Midrashic 
creation myths for hour upon 
stuffy hour in Schule\ the women 
slaving over their duplicate sets of 
dishes, in the peculiar smell of a 
kosher household, so close to be- 
ing a stench compared to all other 
American smells, supporting their 
drone scholars; his mother’s pride 
that Hansli, too, was plainly des- 
tined by God’s will to become a 
holy man; and, when he had dis- 
covered instead the glories and 
rigors of the physical universe, 
that light and airy escape from 
fur hats and the smell of gefiilte 
fish and the loving, worn women, 
the terror of the wrath of the jeal- 
ous God. But all that was many 
years ago; it could not come back. 
He would not have it back. 

“What are you talking about?” 
McKnight said. “Are we going to 
do something — and if so, what? 
Get to the point.” 

“My point,” Satvje said, “is 
that if all this — demonology — is, 
well, valid, or I suppose one 
should say true, then the whole 
Christian mythos is true, though 
it is not coming out in precisely 
the way it was prophesied. That 
being the case, then there are such 
things as immortal souls, or per- 
haps I should say, we may well 
have immortal souls, and we

all along — and if Armageddon has 
ended in a stand-off, a little action 
on the side of our Maker wouldn’t 
be amiss. If He’s still with us and 
actively interested, any maction 
on our parts would probably be 
viewed very gravely indeed if He 
wins after all. And if He’s not with 
us any longer, then we’ll have to 
help ourselves, as the proverb 
says.” 

“That’s the stuff to give the 
troops,” McKnight said. “It is so 
ordered.” 

Buelg nodded and left the office 
to search out Chief Hay. On the 
whole, he felt, he had made a nice 
recovery. 

IV 

P OSITANO had been washed 
away, but the remains of The- 
ron Ware’s palazzo still stood 
above the scoured cliffside, like 
some post-Roman ruin. The ceil- 
ing had fallen in, the fluted pink 
tiles smashing Ware’s glassware 
and burying the dim chalked dia- 
grams of last night’s conjuration 
on the refectory floor in a litter of 
straw and potsherds, mounds of 
which collapsed now and then to 
send streamers of choking dust up 
to meet the gently radioactive 
April rain. 

Ware sat on the heaped remains 
of his altar within the tumbled 
walls, under the uncertain sky. His 
feelings were so complex that he 
could not have begun to explain 
them, even to himself; after many 
years’ schooling in the rigorous 
non-emotions of Ceremonial 
Magic, it was a novelty to him to 
have any feelings at all but those 

24 



of the thirst for knowledge; now 
he would have to re-learn those 
sensations, for his lovely book of 
acquisitions, upon which he had 
spent his soul and so much else, 
was buried under tons of tsunamic 
mud. 

In a way, he thought tentatively, 
he felt free. After the shock of the 
seaquake had passed and all but an 
occasional tile had stopped falling 
he had struggled out of the rubble 
to the door and thence to the head 
of the stairway which led down to 
his bedroom, only to see nothing 
but mud three stone steps down, 
mud wrinkling and settling as the 
sea water gradually seeped out 
from under it. Somewhere down 
under there his book of new 
knowledge was beginning the aeon- 
long route to becoming an un- 
readable fossil. Well then; so 
much for his life. Almost it 
seemed to him then that he might 
begin again, that he was nameless, 
a tabula rosa, all false starts wiped 
out, all dead knowledge ready to 
be rejected or revivified. It was 
given to few men to live through 
something so cleansing as a total 
disaster. 

But then he realized that this, 
too, was only an illusion. His past 
was there, ineluctably, in his com- 
mitments. He was still waiting for 
the return of the Sabbath Goat. 
He closed the door to the stairwell 
and the fossilized ripples of the 
mud and, blowing reflectively into 
his white mustache, went back into 
the refectory. 

Father Domenico had earlier 
tired — it could not exactly be said 
that he had lost patience — of both 
the waiting and the fruitless de- 

GALAXY 




bates over when or whether they 
would be come for, and had de- 
cided to attempt traveling South 
to see what and who remained of 
Monte Albano, the college of 
white magicians which had been 
his home grounds. Baines was 
still here, trying to raise some 
news on the little transistor radio 
to which only yesterday he had lis- 
tened so gluttonously, as it gave 
accounts of the black Easter which 
Ware had raised up at his com- 
mission, and whose consequences 
now eddied away from them 
around the whole tortured globe. 
Now, however, it was producing 
nothing but bands of static and an 
occasional very distant voice in an 
unknown tongue. 

With him now was Jack Gins- 
berg, dressed to the nines as usual, 
and in consequence looking by far 
the most bedraggled of the three. 
At Ware’s entrance, Baines tossed 
the radio to his secretary and 
erossed toward the magician. 

“Find out anything?” 

“Nothing at all. As you can see 
for yourself, the sea is subsiding. 
It is obvious that Positano has 
been spared any further destruc- 
tion — for the moment. As for 
why, we know no more than we 
did before.” 

“You can still work magic, 
can’t you?” 

“I don’t appear to have been 
deprived of my memory,” Ware 
said. “I’ve no doubt I can still do 
magic if I can get at my equip- 
ment under this mess — but wheth- 
er I can work it is another matter. 
The conditions of reference have 
changed drastieally and I have no 
idea how far or in what areas.” 



“Well, you could at least call 
up a demon and see if he could 
give us any information. There 
doesn’t appear to be anyone else 
to ask.” 

“I see that I’ll have to put the 
matter more bluntly. I am totally 
opposed to performing any more 
magic at this time. Doctor Baines. 
I see that you have again failed to 
think the situation through. The 
terms under which I was able to 
call upon demons no longer apply 
— I am no longer able to do any- 
thing for them, they must now 
own a substantial part of the 
world. If I were to call at this 
juncture probably no one would 
answer^and it might be better if 
nobody did, sinee I would have no 
way of controlling him. They are 
composed almost entirely of ha- 
tred for every unFallen creature, 
and every creature with the po- 
tentialty to be redeemed, but there 
is no one they hate more than a 
useless tool.” 

“Well, it seems to me that we 
may neither of us be totally use- 
less even now,” Baines declared. 
“You say the demons now own a 
substantial part of the world, but 
it’s also perfectly evident that they 
don’t own it all yet. Otherwise the 
Goat would have come back when 
he said he would. And we’d be in 
Hell.” 

“Hell has a great many circles. 
We may well be on the margins of 
the first right now- in the Vesti- 
bule of the Futile.” 

“We’d be in a good deal deeper 
if the demons were in total con- 
trol, or if judgment had already 
been passed on us,” Baines said. 

“You are entirely right about 

25 



THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 




that, to be sure,” Ware said, 
somewhat surprised. “But after 
all, from their point of view there 
is no hurry. In the past we might 
have saved ourselves by a last- 
minute act of contrition. Now, 
however, there is no longer any 
God to appeal to. They can wait 
and take us at their leisure.” 

“There Tm inclined to agree 
with Father Domenico. We don’t 
know that for sure; we were told 
so only by the Goat. 1 admit that 
the other evidence all points in the 
same direction, but all the same, 
he could have been lying.” 

W ARE thought about it. The 
argument from circun^tances 
did not of course impress him no 
doubt the circumstances were hor- 
rible beyond the capacity of any 
human soul to react to them but 
they were certainly not beyond the 
range of human imagination. They 
were more or less the standard 
consequences of World War III, a 
war which Baines himself had been 
actively engaged in engineering 
some time before he had discov- 
ered his interest in black magic. 
Theologically they were also stan- 
dard: a new but essentially un- 
changed version of the Problem of 
Evil, the centuries-old question of 
why a good and merciful God 
should allow so much pain and ter- 
ror to be inflicted upon the inno- 
cent. The parameters had been 
filled in a somewhat different way, 
but the fundamental equation was 
the same as it had always been. 

Nevertheless, the munitions 
maker was quite right - as Father 
Domenico had been earlier — to 
insist that they had no reliable in- 

26 



formation upon the most funda- 
mental question of all. 

Ware said slowly; “Fm reluc- 
tant to admit any hope at all at 
this juncture. On the other hand 
it has been said that to despair of 
God is the ultimate sin. What pre- 
cisely do you have in mind?” 

“Nothing specific yet. But sup- 
pose for the sake of argument that 
the demons are still under some 
sort of restrictions - 1 don’t see 
any point in trying to imagine 
what they might be — and that the 
battle consequently isn’t really 
over yet. If that’s the case, it’s 
quite possible that they could still 
use some help. Considering how 
far they’ve managed to get al- 
ready, there doesn’t seem to be 
much doubt about their winning in 
the end — and it’s been my obser- 
vation that it’s generally a good 
idea to be on the winning side.” 

“It is folly to think that the 
triumph of evil could ever be a 
winning side, in the sense of any- 
one’s gaining anything by it. With- 
out good to oppose it, evil is sim- 
ply meaningless. That isn’t at all 
what I thought you had in mind. 
It is, instead, the last step in de- 
spairing of God- it’s worse than 
Manicheanism, it is Satanism 
pure and simple. I once controlled 
devils but I never worshiped them, 
and 1 don’t plan to begin now. Be- 
sides — ” 

Abruptly, the radio produced a 
tearing squeal and then began to 
mutter urgently in German. Ware 
could hear the voice well enough 
to register that the speaker had a 
heavy Swiss accent but not well 
enough to make out the sense. Fie 
and Baines both took a crunching 

GALAXY 




step toward Ginsberg, who, listen- 
ing intently, held up one hand to- 
ward them. 

The speech was interrupted by 
another squeal, and then the radio 
resumed emitting nothing more 
than snaps, crackles, pops and 
waterfalls. 

Ginsberg said, “That was Radio 
Zurich. There’s been an H-bomb 
explosion in the States, in Death 
Valley. Either the war’s started 
again, or some dud’s gone off be- 
latedly.” 

“Hmm,” Baines said. “Well, 
better there than here — although, 
now that I come to think of it, it 
isn’t entirely unpromising. But 
Doctor Ware, I think you hadn’t 
quite finished?” 

“I was only going to add that 
‘being of some help’ to demons in 
this context makes no practical 
sense, either. Their hand is turned 
against everyone on Earth, and 
there is certainly no way that we 
could help them to carry their war 
to Heaven, even presuming that 
any of Heaven still stands. Some- 
one of Eather Domenico’s school 
might just possibly manage to en- 
ter the Aristotelean spheres — 
though I doubt it — but I certainly 
couldn’t.” 

“That bomb explosion seems to 
show that somebody is still fight- 
ing back,” Baines said. “Providing 
that Jack isn’t right about it’s be- 
ing a dud or a stray. My guess is 
that it’s the Strategic Air Com- 
mand and that they’ve just found 
out who the real enemy is. They 
had the world’s finest data-proces- 
sing center there under Denver 
and, in addition, McKnight had 
first-class civilian help, including 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



D^ejms Satvje himself, and a 
RAND man I tried to get the 
Mamaroneck Research Institute 
to outbid the government for.” 

“I still don’t quite see where 
that leaves us.” 

“I know McKnight very well — 
he’s steered a lot of Defense De- 
partment orders my way — and 1 
was going to have LeEebre make 
him president of Consolidated 
Warfare Service when he retired — 
as he was quite well aware. He’s 
good in his field, which is recon- 
naissance, but he also has some- 
thing of a one-track mind. If he’s 
bombing demons, it might be a 
very good idea for me to suggest 
to him that he stop it — and why.” 

“It might at that,” Ware said 
reflectively. “How will you get 
there?” 

“A technicality. Radio Zurich 
is still operating, which almost 
surely means that their airfield is 
operating, too. Jack can fly a 
plane if necessary — but it prob- 
ably won’t be necessary. We had a 
very well-staffed office in Zurich 
— in fact it was officially our cen- 
tral headquarters — and I’ve got 
access to two Swiss bank ac- 
counts, the company’s and my 
own. I’d damn well better put the 
money to some use before some- 
body with a little imagination real- 
izes that the vaults might much 
better be occupied by himself, his 
family and twenty thousand cases 
of canned beans.” 

The project. Ware decided, had 
its merits. At least it would rid 
him, however temporarily, of 
Baines, whose society he was be- 
ginning to find a little tiresome, 
and of Jack Ginsberg, whom he 

27 




distantly but positively loathed. It 
would of course also mean that he 
would be deprived of all human 
company if the Goat should after 
all come for him, but this did not 
bother him in the least; he had 
known for years that in that last 
confrontation every man is always 
alone- and most especially, every 
magician. 

Perhaps he had also always 
known, somewhere in the deepest 
recesses of his mind, that he would 
indeed eventually take that last 
step into Satanism, but if so, he 
had very successfully suppressed 
it. And he had not quite taken it 
yet; he had committed himself to 
nothing, he had only agreed that 
Baines should go away, and Gins- 
berg too, to counsel someone he 
did not know to an inaction which 
might be quite without signifi- 
cance. 

And while they were gone, per- 
haps he would be able to think of 
something better. It was the tini- 
est of small hopes and doubtless 
vain; but now he was beginning to 
be prepared to feed it. If he played 
his cards right, he might yet min- 
gle with the regiment of angels 
who rebelled not, yet avowed to 
God no loyalty, of whom it is said 
that deep Hell refuses them, for, 
beside such, the sinner would be 
proud. 

V 

M onte ALBANO, Father Do- 
menico found with astonish- 
ment and a further rekindling of 
his hope, had been spared com- 
pletely. It reared its Eleventh Cen- 
tury walls— rebuilt after the earth- 

28 



quake then by the abbot Gorgio 
who later became Pope John the 
Twentieth — as high above the val- 
ley as it always had and, as al- 
ways too, was accessible only by 
muleback. Fr. Domenico lost 
more time locating a mule with 
an owner to take him up there 
than the whole trip from Positano 
had cost him. Eventually, however, 
the thing was done and he was 
within the cool walls of the library 
with the white monks, his col- 
leagues, under the hot Frosinian 
sky. 

Those assembled made up near- 
ly the same company that had met 
during the winter to consider, 
fruitlessly, how Theron Ware and 
his lay client might be forestalled: 
Fr. Amparo, Fr. Umberto (the 
Director), and the remaining 
brothers of the Order, plus Fr. 
Uccello, Fr. Boucher, Fr. Vance, 
Fr. Anson, Fr. Selahny and Fr. 
Atheling. The visitors had appar- 
ently continued to stay in the 
monastery — if not in session — 
after the winter meeting, although 
in the interim Fr. Rosenblum had 
died. His place had been taken, 
though hardly filled, by Fr. Do- 
menico’s former apprentice Jo- 
annes, who, though hardly seven- 
teen, looked now as though he had 
grown up very suddenly. Well, 
that was all right; they surely 
needed all the help that they could 
get and Fr. Domenico knew with- 
out false modesty that Joannes 
had been well trained. 

After Fr. Domenico had been 
admitted, announced and conduc- 
ted through the solemn and bless- 
ed joys of greeting and welcome, 
it became apparent that a discus- 

GALAXY 




sion — as was only to have been 
expected — had already been going 
on for many hours. Nor was he 
much surprised to find that it 
was simply another version of the 
discussion that had been going on 
in Positano; namely, how had 
Monte Albano been spared in the 
world-wide catastrophe and what 
did it mean? But in this version of 
the discussion Fr. Domenico could 
join with a much better heart. 

And in fact he was also able to 
give it what amounted to an en- 
tirely new turn; for their Sensitive, 
the hermit-Father Uccello, had 
inevitably found his talents much 
coarsened and blunted by the prox- 
imity of so many other minds, and 
in consequence the white monks 
had only a general idea of what 
had gone on in Ware’s palazzo 
since the last convocation — an im- 
pression supplemented by the 
world news, what of it there was, 
and by deduction, some of which 
was in fact wrong. Father Domen- 
ico recapitulated the story of the 
last conjuration briefly. 

“All in all,” he concluded, “for- 
ty-eight demons were let out of 
the Pit as a result of this cere- 
mony, commanded to return at 
dawn. When it became apparent 
that the operation was completely 
out of hand, I invoked the Cove- 
nant and insisted that Ware re- 
call them ahead of time, to which 
he agreed; but when he attempted 
to summon up lucifuge roco- 
FALE, to direct this abrogation, 
PUT SATANACHiA himself answered 
instead. When I attempted to ex- 
orcise this abominable creature 
my crucifix burst in my hands — 
and it was after that that the mon- 



ster told us that God was already 
dead and that the ultimate victory 
had instead gone to the forces of 
Flell. The Goat promised to return 
for us all — all, that is, except 
Baines’ other assistant Doctor 
Hess, whom Baphomet had al- 
ready swallowed when Hess pan- 
icked and stepped out of his Cir- 
cle — at dawn, but he failed to do 
so, and I subsequently left and 
came to Monte Albano as soon as 
it was physically possible.” 

“Do you recall the names and 
offices of all forty-eight?” said Fr. 
Atheling. 

“I think I do — that is, I think 
I could; after all, I saw them all, 
and that’s an experience which 
does not pass lightly from the 
memory. In any event, if I’ve 
blanked out on a few — which isn’t 
unlikely either — they can doubt- 
less be recovered under hypnosis. 
Why does that matter, may I ask. 
Father Atheling?” 

“Simply because it is always 
useful to know the natures, as well 
as the numbers, of the forces ar- 
rayed against one.” 

“Not after the countryside is 
already overrun,” said Fr. Anson. 
“If the battle and the war have al- 
ready been lost we must have the 
whole crew to contend with now — 
not just all seventy-two princes, 
but every single one of the fallen 
angels. The number is closer to 
seven and a half million than it is 
to forty-eight.” 

“Seven million, four hundred 
and fifty thousand, nine hundred 
and twenty-six,” Fr. Atheling said. 

“Though the wicked may hide, 
the claws of crabs are dangerous 
people in bridges,” Fr. Selahny

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 




intoned abruptly. As was the case 
with all his utterances, the group 
would doubtless find out what this 
one meant only after sorting out 
its mixed mythologies and folk- 
lores and long after it was too late 
to do anything about it. Nor did it 
do any good to ask him to explain; 
these things simply came to him, 
and he no more understood them 
than did his hearers. If God were 
indeed dead, Fr. Domenico won- 
dered suddenly. Who could be dic- 
tating them now? But he put the 
thought aside as non-contributory. 



«rpHERE is a vast concentration 

A of new evil on the other side 
his courtly, hesitant old-man’s 
voice. “The feeling is one of in- 
tense oppression, quite different 
from that which was common in 
New York or Moscow, but one 
such as I would expect of a mass- 
ing of demons upon a huge scale. 
Forgive me, brothers, but I can be 
no more specific.” 

“We know you are doing the 
best you can,” said the Director 
soothingly. 

“I can feel it myself,” said Fr. 
Monteith, who although not a 
Sensitive had had some experience 
with the herding of rebellious spir- 
its. “But even supposing that we 
do not have to cope with so large 
an advance, as I certainly hope we 
do not, it seems to me that forty- 
eight is too large a sum for us if 
the Covenant has been voided. It 
leaves us without even an option.” 

Fr. Domenico saw that Joannes 
was trying to attract the Director’s 
attention, although too hesitantly 
to make any impression. Fr. Um- 

30 



berto was not yet used to thinking 
of Joannes as a person at all. Cap- 
turing the boy’s eyes, Fr. Domeni- 
co nodded. 

“I never did unserstand the Cov- 
enant,” the ex-apprentice said, 
thus encouraged. “That is, I didn’t 
understand why God would com- 
promise Flimself in such a man- 
ner. Even with Job, He didn’t 
make a deal with Satan but only 
allowed him to act unchecked for 
a certain period of time. And I’ve 
never found any mention of the 
Covenant in the grimoires. What 
are its terms, anyhow?” 

Fr. Domenico thought 'the ques- 
tion well asked, if a trifle irrele- 
vant, but an embarassed and 
slightly pitying silence showed that 
his opinion was not shared. In the 
end it was broken by Fr. Mon- 
teith, whose monumental patience 
was a byword in the chapter. 

“I’m certainly not well versed 
in canon law, let alone in spiritu- 
al compacts,” he said with more 
modesty than exactness. “But in 
principle, the Covenant is no more 
than a special case of the option 
of free will. The assumption ap- 
pears to be that even in dealing 
with devilry, on the one hand no 
man shall be subjected to a temp- 
tation beyond his ability to resist, 
and on the other, no man shall 
slide into Heaven without having 
been tempted up to that point. In 
situations involving Transcenden- 
tal or Ceremonial Magic, the Cov- 
enant is the line drawn in between. 
Where you would find its exact 
terms. I’m sure I don’t know; I 
doubt that they have ever been 
written down. One thinks of the 
long struggle to understand the 

GALAXY 




rainbow, the other Covenant; once 
the explanation was in, it did not i 
explain, except to show that every 
man sees his own rainbow, and ; 
what seems to stand in the sky is ■ 
an optical illusion, not a theo- 
morph. It is in the nature of the 
arrangement that the terms would i 
vary in each individual case and 
that if you are incapable of deter- < 
mining where it is drawn for you 
woe betide you, and that is that.” 

Dear God, Fr. Domenico i 
thought, all my life I have been an 
amateur of Roger Bacon and / 
never once saw that that was what 
he meant to show by focusing his 
Perspectiva on the rainbow. Shall 
/ have any more time to learn? I ' 
hope we are never tempted to 
make Monteith the Director, or < 
we shall lose him to taking things 
out of the In box and putting them 
into the Out box, as we did Fr. i 
Umberto . 

“Furthermore, it may well be 
still in existence,” said Fr. Bouch- 
er. “As l-ather Domenico has al- 
ready pointed out to Theron Ware 
himself, we have heard of the al- 
leged death of God only through 
the testimony of the most unre- 
liable witness imaginable. And it 
leaves many inconsistencies to be 
explained. When exactly is God 
supposed to have died? If it was 
as long ago as in Nietzsche’s time, 
why had Flis angels and ministers 
of light seemed to know nothing 
of it in the interim? It’s unreason- 
able to suppose that they were sim- 
ply keeping up a good front until 
the battle actually broke out; 
Heaven simply isn’t that kind of 
an organization. One would ex- 
pect an absolute and perpetual 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



monarchy to break down upon the 
death of the monarch quite 
promptly, yet in point of fact we 
saw no signs of any such thing un- 
til shortly after Christmas of this 
year.” 

“But we did see such signs at 
that time,” Fr. Vance said. 

“True, but this only poses an- 
other logical dilemma: What hap- 
pened to the Antichrist? Bapho- 
met’s explanation that he had been 
dispensed with as unnecessary to 
the victors, whose creature he 
would have been, doesn’t hold wa- 
ter. The Antichrist was to have 
appeared before the battle - and 
if the defeat of God is all that re- 
cent the prophecy should have 
been fulfilled; God still existed to 
compel it.” 

“Matthew eleven, fourteen,” 
Fr. Selahny said, in an unprece- 
dented burst of intelligibility. The 
verse of which he was reminding 
them referred to John the Baptist 
and it said: And if ye will receive 
it, this is Elias, which was for to 
come. 

“Yes,” -Fr. Domenico said, “I 
suppose it's possible that the An- 
tichrist might have come unrec- 
ognized. One always envisioned 
people flocking to his banner 
openly. But the temptation would 
have been more subtle and per- 
haps more dangerous had he crept 
past us, say in the guise of some 
popular philosopher, like that pos- 
itive-thinking man in the States. 
Yet the proposal seems to allow 
even less room than did the Cove- 
nant for the exercise of free will.” 

There was silence. At last the 
Director said; “The Essenes ar- 
gued that one must think and ex- 



31 




perience all evil before one can 
even hope to perceive good.” 

“If this be true doctrine,” Fr. 
Domenico said, “then it follows 
that God is indeed still alive, and 
that Theron Ware’s experiment — 
and World War Three — did not 
constitute Armageddon after all. 
What we may be confronted with 
instead is an Earthly Purgatory, 
from which Grace, and perhaps 
even the Earthly Paradise, might 
be won. Dare we think so?” 

“We dare not think otherwise,” 
said Fr. Vance. “The question is. 
How? Little that is in the New 
Testament, the teachings of the 
Church or the Arcana, seems very 
relevant to the present situation.” 
“No more is our traditional 
isolation,” said Er. Domenico. 
“Our only recourse now is to 
abandon it; to abandon our mon- 
astery and our mountain and go 
down into the world that we re- 
nounced when Charlemagne was 
but a princeling, to try to win it 
back by works and witnessing. And 
if we may not do this with the 
sweet aid of Christ, then we must 
nevertheless do it in His Name. 
Hope now is all we have.” 

“In sober truth,” Er. Boucher 
said quietly, “that is not so great 
a change. 

VI 

L eft to his own devices and 
hence at last unobserved, Ther- 
on Ware thought that it might be 
well, after all, if he did essay a 
small magic. The possible diffi- 
culty lay in that all magic without 
exception depended upon the con- 
trol of demons, as he had explained 
to Baines on his very first visit. 



But therein lay the attractiveness 
of the experiment, too, for what 
he wanted was information — 
whether he still had any such con- 
trol. 

And it would also be interest- 
ing — and possible to find out at 
the same time — to know whether 
or not there were any demons left 
in Hell. If there were it would im- 
ply, though it would not guaran- 
tee, that only the forty-eight that 
he had set loose were now terroriz- 
ing the world. This ruled out using 
the Mirror of Solomon, for the 
spirit of that mirror was the angel 
Anael. Probably he would not an- 
swer anyhow, for Ware was not a 
white magician and had carefully 
refrained from calling upon any 
angel ever since he had turned to 
the practice of the black Art — be- 
sides, it would be a considerable 
nuisance locating three white pi- 
geons amid all this devastation. 

Who, then? Among the demon 
princes he had decided not to call 
up for Baines’ commission were 
several that he had ruled out be- 
cause of their lesser potentialities 
for destruction, which would stand 
him in good stead were it to turn 
out that he had lost control; even 
in Hell there were degrees of ma- 
levolence, as of punishment. 

Also, Ware realized, his now 
would have to be a small magic 
indeed, for most of his instruments 
were now buried and those that 
were accessible were all contami- 
nated beyond his power to purify 
them in any useful period of time. 
Clearly it was time to consult the 
book. He crossed to the lectern 
upon which it rested, pushed dust 
and potsherds off it with his sleeve.

GALAXY 




unlocked the clasp and began to 
turn the great stiff pages, not with- 
out a qualm. Here, signed with 
his own blood, was half his life; 
the other half was down below, in 
the mud. 

He found the name he needed 
almost at once: VASSAGO, a 
mighty prince, who in his first es- 
tate before the rebellion had be- 
longed to the choir of the Virtues. 
The Lemegeton of the Rabbi Solo- 
man said of him. Ware recalled, 
that he “declares things past, pre- 
sent and future and discovers what 
has been lost or hidden.” Precisely 
to the purpose. Ware remembered, 
too, that his was the name most 
commonly invoked in ceremonial 
crystallomancy, which would be 
perfect in both scope and limita- 
tions for what Ware had in mind, 
involving no lengthy preparations 
of the operator, or even any pre- 
cautionary diagrams, nor any ap- 
paratus except a crystal ball; and 
even for that he might substitute 
a pool of exorcised water, fifty 
liters of which still reposed in a 
happily unruptured stainless steel 
tank imbedded in the wall behind 
Ware’s workbench. 

Furthermore, he was the only 
demon in Ware’s entire book of 
pacts who was represented therein 
by two seals or characters, so 
markedly different that without 
seeing them side by side one might 
never suspect that they belonged to 
the same entity. Topologically they 
were closely related, however, and 
Ware studied these relationships 
long and hard, knowing that he 
had once known what they meant 
but was now unable to recall it. 
These were the figures: 




Ah, now he had it. The left-hand 
figure was VASSAGO’s ordinary 
infernal sign but the second was 
the seal under which, it was said, 
he could be called by white ma- 
gicians. Ware had never used it, 
nor had he needed to — the infer- 
nal seal had worked very well — and 
he had always doubted its efficacy, 
for by definition no commerce with 
a demon is white magic; however, 
it would be well to try it now. It 
might provide an additional factor 
of safety if it worked at all. 

Into what should he draw the 
water? Everything was filthy. 
Eventually he decided simply to 
make a puddle on the workbench; 
it had been decades since he had 
studied oneirology, which he had 
scorned as a recourse for mere 
hedge-wizards, but to the best of 
his recollection it called for nothing 
more extraordinary than an earth- 
enware vessel and could even be 
practiced successfully in an ordi- 
nary, natural forest pool, provid- 
ing there was sufficient shade. 



THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



33 





Well then, to work. 



S TANDING insecurely before 
the workbench, the little weight 
of his spare upper body resting up- 
on his elbows and his hands beside 
his ears, Theron Ware stared 
steadfastedly down into the little 
puddle of mud, his own bushy head 
— he had neglected his tonsure 
since the disaster — shading it from 
the even light of overcast sky. He 
had already stared so long since 
the first invocation that he felt 
himself on the verge of self-hyp- 
nosis, but now, he thought, there 
was a faint stirring down there in 
those minature Carboniferous 
depths, like a bubble or a high- 
light created by some non-exist- 
ent sun. Yes, a faint spark — 

“Eka, dva. tri, chatur, pancha, 
shas, sapta, ashta, nava, dasha, 
ekadasha,” Ware counted. “Per 
vota nostra ipse nunc surtat nobis 
dicatusW ASSAGOV' 

The spark continued to grow un- 
til it was nearly the size of a ten- 
lira piece, stabilized, and gradually 
began to develop features. De- 
spite its apparent diameter the 
thing did not look small; the ef- 
fect rather was one of great dis- 
tance, as though Ware were seeing 
a reflection of the moon. 

The features were quite beauti- 
ful and wholly horrible. Superfi- 
cially the shining face resembled 
a human skull but it was longer, 
thinner, more triangular, and it had 
no cheekbones. The eyes were huge 
and slanted almost all the way up 
to where a human hairline would 
have been; the nose extremely long 
in the bridge; the mouth as pink 

34 



and tiny as that of an infant. The 
color and texture of the face were 
old ivory, like netsuke. No body 
was visible but Ware had not ex- 
pected one; this was not, after all, 
a full manifestation but only an 
apparition. 

The rosebud mouth moved 
damply and a pure soprano voice, 
like that of a choirboy, murmured 
soundlessly in Ware’s mind. 

WHO IS IT CALLS VASSAGO FROM 
STUDYING OF THE DAMNED? BE- 
WARE! 

Thou knowest me, demon of the 
Pit, Ware thought, for to a pact 
hast thou subscribed with me and 
written into my book thine Infern- 
al name. Thereby, and by thy seal 
which / do here exhibit, do / com- 
pel thee. My questions shalt thou 
answer and give true knowledge. 

SPEAK AND BE DONE. 

Art still in Hell with thy broth- 
ers — or are all abroad about the 
Earth? 

SOME DO GO TO AND FRO BUT 
WE ABIDE HERE. NEVERTHELESS, 
WE BE ON EARTH, ALBEIT NOT 
ABROAD. 

In what wise? 

THOUGH WE MAY NOT YET LEAVE 
NETHER HELL, WE BE AMONG YE: 
FOR THE PIT HATH BEEN RAISED UP, 
AND THE CITY OF DIS NOW STAND- 
ETH UPON THE EARTH. 

Ware made no attempt to dis- 
quise his shock; after all, the crea- 
ture could see into his mind. 

How situate? 

WHERE SHE STOOD EROM ETERN- 
ITY; IN THE VALLEY OF DEATH. 

Ware suspected at once that the 
apparently allegorical form of this 
utterance concealed a literal mean- 
ing but it would do no good to ask 

GALAXY 




for exact topographical particu- 
lars; demons paid little attention 
to Earthly political geography un- 
less they were fomenting strife 
about boundaries or enclaves, 
which was not one of VAS- 
SAGO’s roles. Could the reference 
be literary? That would be in ac- 
cordance with the demon’s nature. 
Nothing prevents devils from quot- 
ing scripture to their own advan- 
tage, so why not Tennyson? 

Be this valley under the Ambas- 
sadorship of RIM MON? 

NAY. 

Then what officers inhabit the 
region wherein it lies? Divulge their 
names, great prince, to my express 
command! 

THEY ARE THE INFERIORS OF AS- 
TAROTH, WHO ARE CALLED SAR- 
GATANAS AND NEBIROS. 

But which hath his asylum where 
Dis now stands? 

THERE RULETH NEBIROS. 

These were the demons of post- 
Columbian magic; they announced 
forth to the subjects all things 
which their lord hath commanded, 
according to the Grimorium Ver- 
um, in America, and the asylum 
of NEBIROS was further speci- 
fied to be in the West. Of course: 
Death Valley. And NEBIROS, as 
it was said in the Grand Grimoire, 
was the field-marshal of Infernus 
and a great necromancer, “who 
goeth to and fro everywhere and 
inspects the hordes of perdition”. 
The raising of the fortress of Dis 
in the domain of this great general 
most strongly suggested that the 
war was not over yet. Ware knew 
better, however, than to ask the 
demon whether God was in fact 
dead; for were He not the mere 



sounding of the Holy Name would 
so offend this minor prince as to 
terminate the apparition at once, 
if not render further ones impos- 
sible. Well, the question was prob- 
ably unnecessary anyhow; he al- 
ready had most of the information 
that he needed. 

Thou art discharged. 

T he shining face vanished with 
a flash of opalescence, exact- 
ly as though a soap bubble had 
broken, leaving Ware staring down 
at nothing but a puddle of mud, 
now already filming and cracking 
-except in the center where the 
face had been: that had evaporated 
completely. Straightening his ach- 
ing back, he considered carefully 
the implications. 

The military organization of the 
Descending Hierarchy was pecu- 
liar and authorities differed some- 
what on its details. This was hard- 
ly surprising, for any attempt to 
relate the offices of the evil spirits 
to Earthly analogues was bound 
to be only an approximation, if 
not sometimes actively misleading. 
Ware was presently in the domain 
of HUTGIN, Ambassodor in 
Italy, and had never before had any 
need to invoke ASTAROTH or 
any of his inferior Intelligences. 
He was characterized by the Gri- 
morium Verum as the Grand Duke 
of Hell, whereas Weirus referred to 
him as Grand Treasurer; while the 
Grand Grimoire did not mention 
him at all, assigning NEBIROS 
instead to an almost equivalent 
place. Nevertheless it seemed clear 
enough in general that while the 
domain of ASTAROTH might 
technically be in America, his 

35 



THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 




principality was not confined there- 
to but might make itself known 
anywhere in the world. HUTGIN 
was a considerably lesser figure. 

And tho war was not yet over 
and Ware might indeed find some 
way to make himself useful. Baines 
had been right about that, too. But 
in what way remained unclear. 

Very probably he would have 
to go to Dis to find out. It was a 
terrifying thought but Ware could 
see no way around it. That was 
where the center of power was 
now, where the war would hence- 
forth be directed; and there, if 
Baines actually succeeded in reach- 
ing the SAC in Denver, Ware con- 
ceivably might succeed in arrang- 
ing some sort of a detente. Cer- 
tainly he would be of no use squat- 
ting here in ruined Italy, with all 
the superior spirits half a world 
away. 

But how to get there? 

Would it be possible to compel 
ASTAROTH to provide him with 
some kind of an apport? This, too, 
was a terrifying thought. To the 
best of Ware’s knowledge the last 
magician to have ridden astride a 
devil had been Gerbert, back in 
the Tenth Century. He had resort- 
ed to it only to save his life from 
a predecessor of the Inquisition, 
whose attention he had amply 
earned; and, moreover, had lived 
through the ordeal to become Pope 
Sylvester II. 

Gerbert had been a great man 
and, though Ware rather doubted 
that he had been any better a magi- 
cian than Ware was, he did not feel 
prepared to try that conclusion just 
now. In any event, the process was 
probably unnecessarily drastic; 

36 



transvection might serve the pur- 
pose just as well, or better. Though 
he had never been to a sabbat, he 
knew the theory and the particu- 
lars well enough. Included in the 
steel cabinets which held his 
magickal pharmacopoeia were all 
the ingredients necessary for the 
flying ointment, and the com- 
pounding of it required no special 
time or ritual. 

First, however, he drew from 
the cabinet a flat slab of synthetic 
ruby about the size and shape of 
an opened match folder; and from 
his cabinet of instruments, a burin. 
Upon the ruby, on the day of 
Mars, which is 0100, 0800, 1500 or 
2200 on that day, he would engrave 
the following seal and characters: 







This he would henceforth carry 
in his right shirt pocket, like a re- 
liquary. Though he would accept 
no help from ASTAROTH if he 
could possibly avoid it, it would 
be well, since he was going to be 
travelling in that fiend’s domains, 
to be wearing his colors. As a pur- 
ist it bothered him a little that the 
ruby was synthetic — but his distur- 
bance, he knew, was only an aes- 
thetic one, ASTAROTH was a 
solar spirit and the ancients, all the 
way through Albertus Magnus, 
had believed that rubies were en- 
gendered in the Earth by the in- 
fluence of the Sun — but since they 
were not in fact formed that way, 
the persistence of the ruby in the 
ritual was only another example 
of one of the primary processes 

GALAXY 




of magic, superstition, the gradual 
supremacy of the sign over the 
thing. 

For a magician, Ware reflected, 
there were indeed distinct advan- 
tages in being able to practice ten 
centuries after Gerbert had ridden 
upon his demon eagle. 

VII 

T RANSVECTION, too, has its 
hazards. Ware discovered. He 
crossed the Atlantic without inci- 
dent in well under three hours — 
indeed, he suspected that in some 
aspect beyond the reach of his 
senses, the flight was taking place 
only partially in real time — and 
it began to look as though he would 
easily reach his goal before dawn. 
The candle affixed by its own tal- 
low to the bundle of twigs and 
rushes before him (for only the 
foolhardy fly a broomstick with 
the brush trailing, no matter what 
is shown to the contrary in con- 
ventional Hallowe’en cartoons) 
burned as steadily as though he 
were not in motion at all, casting 
a brilliant light ahead along his 
path; any ships at sea that might 
have seen him might have taken 
him to be an unusually brilliant 
meteor. As he approached the 
eastern United States he wondered 
how he would show up on radar; 
the dropping of the bomb two days 
ago suggested that there might still 
be a number of functioning ra- 
domes there. In quieter times, he 
thought, he might perhaps have 
touched off another flying-saucer 
scare. Or was he visible at all? He 
discovered that he did not know. 
But once over land he slowed 



himself down and lost altitude in 
order to get his bearings — and 
within what seemed to him to be 
only a very few minutes he was 
grounded' head over heels by the 
sound of a churchbell forlornly 
calling what faithful might remain 
to midnight mass. He remembered 
belatedly, when he got his wind 
back, that in some parts of Ger- 
many during the Seventeenth Cen- 
tury flowering of the popular God 
tic cults, it had been the custom to 
toll churchbells all night long as a 
protection against witches who 
might be passing overhead on the 
way to the Brocken; but the mem- 
ory did him no good now. 

He had fallen in a rather moun- 
tainous, heavily timbered area he 
guessed to be somewhere in eastern 
Pennsylvania. Though it was now 
late April, which was doubtless 
warm in Positano, the night here 
was decidely cold, especially for a 
thin man clad in nothing more than 
a light smear of unguent. He was 
instantly and violently all ashiver, 
for the sound of the bell had de- 
stroyed the protective as well as 
the transvective power of the fly- 
ing ointment. He hastily undid the 
bundle of clothes which was tied 
to the broomstick but there were 
not going to be enough of them; 
after all, he had assembled them 
with Death Valley in mind. Also, 
he was beginning to feel drowsy 
and dizzy and his pulse was blurred 
and banging with tachycardia. 
Among other things, the flying 
ointment contained both mandra- 
gora and belladonna, and now that 
the magic was gone out of it, these 
were exerting their inevitable side 
effects. He would have to wash the 



THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



37 




stuff off the minute he could find 
a stream, cold or no cold. 

And not only because it was 
drugging him. Still other ingre- 
dients of the ointment were rather 
specifically organic in nature, and 
these gave it a characteristic smell 
which the heat of his body would 
gradually ripen. The chances were 
all too good that there would be 
some people in this country of the 
Amish — and not all of them old 
ones- who would know what the 
odor meant. Until he had had some 
kind of a bath it would be danger- 
ous even to ask for help. 

Before dressing he wiped off as 
much of it as he could with the 
towel in which the clothing had 
been tied. This he buried, together 
with the taper and the brush from 
the besom — and after making sure 
that the ruby talisman was still 
safely in his pocket, he set out. 

The nightblack, hilly, forested 
countryside would have made dif- 
ficult going even for an experienced 
walker. Ware’s life on the other 
hand, had been nearly inactive ex- 
cept intellectually and he was on 
the very near side of his fiftieth 
birthday. To his advantage, on the 
other hand, stood the fact that he 
had always been small and wiry 
and the combination of a slightly 
hyperthyroid metabolism and an 
ascetic calling — he did not even 
smoke — had kept him that way, so 
that he made fair progress. An 
equally lifelong love of descriptive 
astronomy, plus the necessity of 
astrology to his art, helped to keep 
him going in the right direction. 

J UST before dawn he stumbled 
upon a small, rock-bedded 

38 



stream and through the gloom 
heard the sound of a nearby water 
fall. He moved against the current 
and shortly found this to be the 
spillway of a small log dam. 
Promptly he stripped and bathed 
under it, pronouncing in a whisper 
as he did so all three of the accom- 
panying prayers from the rite of 
lustration as prescribed for the 
preparatory triduum in the Grim- 
orium Verum. Though the water 
was neither warm nor exorcised it 
was obviously pure and that would 
have to do. 

The ablution was every bit as 
cold as he had expected it to be, 
and even colder was the process 
of air-drying himself; but he en- 
dured it stoically, for he had to 
get rid of what remained of the 
ointment to put on damp clothes 
would also be dangerous. While 
he waited, his teeth chattering, 
faint traces of light began to ap- 
pear through the trees from the 
east. 

In answer, massive gray rectan- 
gular shapes began to sketch them- 
selves against the darkness down- 
stream and before long he was able 
to see that to the west — which was 
the way the stream was momen- 
tarily running — was a substantial 
farm. As if in confirmation of help 
to come, a cock crowed in the dis- 
tance, a traditional ending for a 
night of magic. 

But as the dawn continued to 
brighten he saw that there would 
be no help for him here. Under the 
angle of the roof of the large barn 
nearest to him a circular diagram 
had been painted, like a formalized 
flower with an eye in it. 

As Jack Ginsberg had taken the 

GALAXY 




pains to find out long before he i 
and his boss had even met the ma- f 
gician, Ware had been born ami t 
raised in the States and was still s 
a citizen. As his name showed, his \ 
background was Methodist — but s 
nevertheless he knew a hex sign t 
when he saw one. And it gave him i 
an idea. \ 

The opportunity to gather new t 
data should not be miss^. f 

Reaching into his shirt pocket, t 
he turned the ruby around so that 1 
the seal and characters on it faced f 
outwards. In a low voice, he said, 1 
“THOMATOS, BENESSER, 1 
FLEANTER.” \ 

Under proper circumstances 
these words of the Comte de Ca- i 
balis encompassed the operator i 
with thirty-three several Intelli- i 
gences — but since the circum- t 
stances were not proper Ware was i 
not surprised when nothing hap- \ 
pened. For one thing, his lustra- s 
tiofi had been imperfect; for an- 1 
other, he was ising the wrong tal- £ 
isman — the infernal spirits of this e 
ceremony were not devils but Sala- r 
manders or fire elementals. Never- b 
theless he now added: “LITAN, t 
ISER, OSNAS.” b 

A morning breeze sprang up t 
and a leaflike whispering ran b 
around him, which might or might t 
not have been the voices of many \ 
beings individually saying, “NAN- - 
THER, NANTHER, NANTH- c 
ER, NANTHER. .” Touching s 
the talisman. Ware said, “GITAU, t 
HURANDOS: RIDAS, TALI- c 
MOL,” and then, pointing to the c 
barn, “UUSUR, ETAR.” b 

The result should have breen a b 
highly localized but destructive 
earthquake but there was not even c 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



a minor tremor, though he was 
pretty sure that he really had heard 
the responsive voices of the fire 
spirits. The spell simply would not 
work under the eye of the hex 
sign — one more piece of evidence 
that the powers of evil were still 
under some kind of restraint. That 
was good to know but in a way, 
too, Ware was quite disappointed; 
for had he gotten his earthquake, 
the further words SOUTRAM, 
UBARSINENS would have com- 
pellai the Intelligences to carry 
him m:ross the rest of his journey. 
He uttered them anyhow — but 
without result. 

Neither in the Comte de Gabal- 
is or its very late sucessor. The 
Black Pullet, did this ritual offer 
any word of dismissal, but never- 
theless for safety’s sake he now 
add«i; “RABIAM.” Had this 
worked he would have found him- 
self orrierf home again, where at 
least he couM have started over 
again with more ointment and 
another broomstick — but it did 
not. There was no recourse now 
but to seek out the farmhouse and 
try to persuade the farmer to give 
him something to eat and drive him 
to the nearest railhead. It was too 
bad that the man could not be told 
that he had just been protected by 
Ware from a demonic onslaught 
— but unfortunately the Amish 
did not believe that there was any 
such thing as white magic and in 
the ultimate analysis they were 
quite right not to do so, whatever 
delusions about the point might 
be harbored by Fr. Domenico and 
his fellows. 

The farmhouse proper looked 
clean, fat and prosperous but it 



39 




was suspiciously quiet. By this 
hour everyone should be up and 
beginning the day’s chores. Ware 
approached with caution, alert for 
guns or dogs, but the silence con- 
tinued. 

The caution had been needless. 
Inside, the place was an outright 
slaughterhouse, resembling nothing 
so much as the last act of Web- 
ster’s The White Devil. Ware in- 
spected it with clinical fascination. 
The family had been a large one — 
the parents, one grandparent, four 
daughters, three sons and the in- 
evitable dog — and at some time 
during the preceding night they 
had suddenly fallen upon each 
other with teeth, nails, pokers, a 
buggy-whip, a bicycle chain, a clea- 
ver, a pig knife and the butt end 
of a smooth-bore rifle old enough 
to have been a relic of the Boer 
War. It was an obvious case of 
simultaneous mass possession, 
probably worked through the 
women, as these things almost al- 
ways were. Doubtless they would 
infinitely have preferred a simple 
localized earthquake, but from 
an attack like this no conceivable 
peasant hex sign could have pro- 
tected them. 

Probably nothing could have, for 
as it had turned out, in their simple 
traditional religiosity they had 
chosen the wrong side. Like most 
of mankind they had been born vic- 
tims — even a beginning study of 
the Problem of Evil would have 
suggested to them that their God 
had never played fair with them, 
as indeed He had caused to be 
written out in Job for all to read. 
And their primitive backwoods 
demonology had never honestly 

40 



admitted that there really were two 
sides to the Great Game, let alone 
allowed them any inkling of who 
the players were. 

While he considered what to do 
next he prowled around the kitchen 
and the woodshed, where the larder 
was, trying not to slip or step on 
anybody. There were only two eggs 
— today’s had obviously not been 
harvested — but he found smoked, 
streaky rashers of bacon, a day- 
old loaf of bread just ripe for cut- 
ting, nearly a pound of country 
butter and a stone jug of cold 
milk. All in all it was a good deal 
more than he could eat but he built 
a fire in the old wood-burning 
stove, cooked the eggs and the ba- 
con and did his best to put it all 
down. After all, he had no idea 
when he would meet his next meal. 
He had already decided that he was 
not yet desperate enough to risk 
calling for an apport, but instead 
would keep walking generally west- 
ward until he met an opportunity 
to steal a car. (He would find none 
on the farm; the Amish still re- 
stricted themselves to horses.) 

As he came out of the farmhouse 
into the bright morning, a sand- 
wich in both hip pockets, he heard 
from the undestroyed barn a de- 
manding lowing of cattle. Sorry, 
friends, he thought. Nobody’s 
going to milk you this morning. 

VHI 

B aines knew the structure and 
approaches of Strategic Air 
Command headquarters rather 
better than the Department of De- 
fense would have thought right and 
proper even for a civilian with Q 

GALAXY 



clearance, although there had been f 
several people in DOD who would i 
not have been at all surprised at i 
it. The otherwise passengerless jet j 
carrying him and Jack Ginsberg i 
made no attempt to approach eith- 1 
er Denver Airport or the U. S. ; 
Air Force Academy field at Colo- ' 
rado Springs, both of which, he i 
correctly assumed, would no long- { 
er be in existence anyhow. Instead, I 
he directed the pilot to land at Li- i 
mon, a small town which was the 1 
easternmost vertex of a nearly ( 
equilateral triangle formed by these ( 
three points. Hidden there was one j 
terminus of an underground rapid t 
transit line which led directly into I 
the heart of SAC’s fortress — and ( 

was now its only surviving means ; 
of physical access to the outside ( 
world. I 

Baines and his secretary had ’ 
been there only once before, and i 
the guards at the station now were < 
not only new but thoroughly fright- I 
ened. Hence, despite the possession ' 
of ID cards countersigned by Gen- : 
eral McKnight, they were subject- I 
ed to over an hour of questioning, < 
fingerprinting, photographing of I 
retinal blood vessel patterns, frisk- i 
ing and fluoroscopy for hidden I 
weapons or explosives, telephone 
calls into the interior and finally I 
a closed-circuit television confron- ; 
tation with McKnight himself be- . 
fore they were even allowed into 
the waiting room. I 

As if in partial compensation, I 
the trip itself was rapid transit in- i 
deed. The line was a gravity-vacu- : 
um tube, bored in an exactly i 
straight line under the curvature 
of the earth and kept as completely 
exhausted of air as outgrassing ■ 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



from its steel cladding would per- 
mit. The vacuum in the tube was in 
fact almost as hard as the atmos- 
phere of the moon. From the wait- 
ing room Baines and Jack Gins- 
berg were passed through two 
airlocks into a seamlessly welded, 
windowless metal capsule which 
was sealed behind them. Here their 
guards strapped them in securely, 
for their own protection, for the 
initial kick of compressed air be- 
hind the capsule, abetted by rings 
of electromagnets, gave it an ac- 
celeration of more than five miles 
per hour per second. Thereafter 
the capsule was simply allowed to 
fall to the mathematical midpoint 
of its right of way, gaining speed 
at about twenty-eight feet per sec- 
ond per second; since the rest of 
the journey was uphill, the capsule 
was slowed in proportion by grav- 
ity, friction and the compression 
of the almost nonexistent gasses in 
the tube still ahead of it, which 
without any extra braking what- 
soever brought it to a stop at the 
SAC terminus of the line so pre- 
cisely that only a lovepat from a 
fifteen horsepower engine was 
needed to line up its airlock with 
that of the station. 

“When you’re riding a thing like 
this it’s hard to believe that there’s 
any such thing as a devil, isn’t it?” 
Jack Ginsberg said. 

“Maybe,” Baines said. “A large 
part of the mystic tradition says 
that the possession and use of sec- 
ular knowledge — or even the de- 
sire for it — is in itself evil, accord- 
ing to Ware. But here we are.” 

B ut in the smooth-running, 
even-temperatured caverns of 



41 




the SAC Baines himself felt rather 
reassured. There was no Goat grin- 
ning over his shoulder yet. Mc- 
Knight was an old friend; he was 
pleased to see Buelg again and 
honored to meet Satvje; and down 
here, at least, everything seemed 
to be under control. It was also 
helpful to find that both McKnight 
and his two advisors not only al- 
ready knew the real situation but 
had very nearly accepted it. Only 
Buelg remained a little sceptical 
at the beginning and seemed quite 
taken aback to find Baines, of all 
people, providing independent testi- 
mony to the same effeet as had 
the computer. When the new facts 
Baines had' brought had been fed 
into the machine and the machine 
had produced in response a whole 
new batch of conclusions entirely 
consistent with the original hypo- 
thesis, Buelg seemed convinced, 
although it was plain that he still 
did not like it. Well, who did? 

At long last they were comfor- 
tably settled in McKnight’s office 
with three tumblers of Jack Dan- 
iels (Jack Ginsberg did not drink, 
and neither did Suatvje) and no 
one to interrupt them but an oc- 
casional runner from Chief Hay. 
Though the runner was a coolly 
pretty blonde girl and the USAF’s 
women’s auxiliary had apparently 
adopted the miniskirt, Ginsberg 
did not seem to notice. Perhaps he 
was still in shock from his recent 
run-in with the suceubus. To 
Baines’ eyes the girl did look rath- 
er remarkably like Ware’s Greta, 
which should have captured Jaek 
instantly; but then, in the long run, 
most women looked alike to 
Baines. 

42 



“That bomb did you no good 
at all, I take it,” he said. 

“Oh, I wouldn’t go so far as to 
say that,” McKnight said. “True, 
it didn’t destroy the city — or even 
hurt it visibly — but it certainly 
seemed to take them by surprise. 
For about an hour after the fire- 
ball went up, the sky above the 
target was full of them. It was like 
firing a flashbulb in a cave full of 
sleeping bats — and we got pictures, 
too.” 

“Any evidence that you, uh, 
destroyed any of them?” 

“Well, we saw a lot of them 
going hack to the city under their 
own power despite very bad design, 
they seem to fly pretty well but 
we don’t have any count of how 
many went up. We didn’t see any 
falling but that might have been 
because some of them had been 
vaporized.” 

“Not bloody likely. Their bodies 
may have been vaporized, but the 
bodies were borrowed in the first 
place. Like knocking down a ra- 
dio-controlled aircraft; the craft 
may be a total loss, but the con- 
trolling intelligence is unharmed, 
somewhere else, and can send an- 
other one against you whenever it 
likes.” 

“Excuse me. Doctor Baines, but 
the analogy is inexact,” Buelg 
said. “We know that because we 
did get a lot out of the bomb be- 
sides simply stirring up a flurry. 
High-speed movies of the column 
of the mushroom as it went up 
show a lot of the creatures trying 
to reform. One individual we were 
able to follow went through thirty- 
two changes in the first minute. 
The changes are all incredible and 

GALAXY 




beyond any physical theory or 
model we can erect to account for 
them, but they do show, first, that 
the creature was seriously incon- 
venienced and, second that it 
wanted and perhaps needed to hold 
on to some kind of physical form. 
That’s a start. It suggests to me 
that had we been able to confine 
them all in the fireball, where the 
temperatures are much higher still, 
no gamut of change they could 
have run through would have done 
them any good. Eventually they 
would have been stripped of the 
last form and utterly destroyed.” 
“The last form, maybe,” Baines 
said. “But the spirit would remain. 
I don’t know why they’re clinging 
to physical forms so determinedly, 
but it probably has only a local 
and tactical reason, something to 
do with the prosecuting of the 
present war. But you can’t destroy 
a spirit by such means any more 
than you can destroy a message by 
burning the piece of paper it’s writ- 
ten on.” 

A S HE said this he became un- 
comfortably aware that he had 
gotten the argument out of some 
sermon against atheism that he 
had heard as a boy, and had 
thought simple-minded even then. 
But since then he had seen demons 
—and a tot more closely than any- 
body else here had. 

“Th^ is perhaps an open ques- 
tion,” Satvje said heavily. “I am 
not myself a skeptic, you should 
understand. Doctor Baines, but I 
have to remind myself that no 
spirit has ever been so intensively 
tested to destruction before. In- 
side a thermonuclear fireball even 



the nuclei of hydrogen atoms find 
it difficult to retain their integ- 
rity.” 

“Atomic nuclei remain matter, 
and the conservation laws still ap- 
ply. Demons are neither matter 
nor energy; they are something 
else.” 

“We do not know that they are 
not energy,” Satvje said. “They 
may well be fields, falling some- 
where within the electro-magnet- 
ico-gravitic triad. Remember that 
we have never achieved a unified 
field theory — even Einstein repu- 
diated his in the last years of his 
life, and quantum mechanics — 
with all respeci to de Broglie — is 
only a clumsy avoidance of the 
problem. These . spirits ... may 
be such unified fields. And one 
characteristic of such fields might 
be one hundred percent negative 
entropy.” 

“There couldn’t be any such 
thing as completely negative en- 
tropy,” Buelg put in. “Such a sys- 
tem would constantly accumulate 
order, which means that it would 
run backwards in time and we 
would never be aware of it at all. 
You have to allow for Planck’s 
Constant. This would be the only 
stable case — ” 

He wrote rapidly on a pad, 
stripped off the sheet and passed it 
across the table. The note read, in 
very neat lettering: 

The girl came in with another 
manifold of sheets from the com- 
puter, and this time Jack Gins- 
berg’s eye could be observed to be 
wandering haunchward a little. 



THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



43 




Baines had never objected to this 
he preferred his most valuable em- 
ployees' to have a few visible and 
usable weaknesses — but for once 
he almost even sympathized; he 
was feeling a little out of his depth. 
“Meaning what?” he said. 
“Why,” Satvje said, a little pa- 
tronizingly, “eternal life, of 
course. Life is negative entropy. 
Stable negative entropy is eternal 
life.” 

“Barring accidents,” Buelg said, 
with a certain grim relish. “We 
have no access yet to the gravitic 
part of the spectrum, but the elec- 
tromagnetic sides are totally vul- 
nerable and with the clues we’ve 
got now we ought to be able to be 
able to burst into such a closed 
system like a railroad spike going 
through an auto tire.” 

“If you can kill a demon,” 
Baines said slowly, “Then — ” 
“That’s right,” Buelg said affa- 
bly. “Angel, devil, ordinary im- 
mortal soul — you name it, we can 
do for it. Not right away, maybe, 
but before very long.” 

“Perhaps the ultimate human 
achievement,” Satvje said, with a 
dreaming, almost beautific expres- 
sion. “The theologians call con- 
demnation to Hell the Second 
Death. Soon, perhaps, we may be 
in a position to give the Third 
Death ... the bliss of complete ex- 
tinction . liberation from the 
Wheel!” 

McKnight’s eyes were now also 
wandering, though toward the ceil- 
ing. He wore the expression of a 
man who has heard all this before 
and is not enjoying it any better 
the second time. Baines himself 
was very far from being bored — 



indeed, he was as close to horrified 
fascination as he had ever been in 
his life — but clearly it was time to 
bring everybody back to Earth. 

He said, “Talk’s cheap. Do you 
have any actual plans?” 

“You bet we do,” McKnight 
said, suddenly galvanized. “I’ve 
had Chief Hays run me an inven- 
tory of the country’s remaining 
military power and believe me, 
there’s a lot of it. I was surprised 
myself. We are going to mount a 
major attack upon this City of 
Dis, and for it we’re going to bring 
some things up out of the ground 
that the American people have 
never seen before and neither has 
anybody else, including this pack 
of demons. I don’t know why 
they’re just sitting there, but may- 
be it’s because they think they’ve 
already got us licked. Well, they’re 
dead wrong. Nobody can lick the 
United States — not in the long 
run!” 

I T WAS an extraordinary senti- 
ment from a man who had been 
maintaining for years that the 
United States had “lost” China, 
“surrendered” Korea, “aban- 
doned” Vietnam and was overrun 
by home-bred Communists; but 
Baines, who knew the breed, saw 
no purpose in calling attention to 
the fact. Their arguments, not be- 
ing based in reason, cannot be 
swayed by reason. 

Instead he said, “General, be- 
lieve me, I advise against it. I 
know some of the weapons you’re 
talking about and they’re pretty 
powerful. I ought to know; my 
company designed and supplied 
some of them, so it would be 



44 



GALAXY 




against my own interests to run 
them down to you. But I very 
much doubt that any of them will 
do any good under the present cir- 
cumstances.” 

“That, of course, remains to be 
seen,” McKnight said. 

“I’d rather we didn’t. If they 
work we may find ourselves worse 
off than before. That’s the point I 
came here to press. The demons 
are about ninety percent in charge 
of the world now — but you’ll no- 
tice that they haven’t taken any 
further steps against us. There’s a 
reason for this. They are fighting 
against another Opponent entirely, 
and it’s quite possible that we 
ought to be on their side.” 

McKnight leaned back in his 
chair, with the expression of a 
president confronted at a press 
conference with a question on 
which he had not been briefed. 

“Let me be quite sure I under- 
stand you. Doctor Baines,” he 
said. “Do you propose that the 
present invasion of the United 
States was a good thing? And, fur- 
ther, that we ought not to be op- 
posing the occupying forces with 
all our might? That indeed we 
ought instead to be aiding and 
abetting the powers responsible for 
it?” 

“I don’t propose any aiding and 
abetting whatsoever,” Baines said, 
with an inward sigh. “I just think 
we ought to lay off for a while, 
that’s all, until we see how the situ- 
ation works out.” 

“You are almost the last man in 
the world,” McKnight said stiffly, 
“whom I would have suspected of 
being a ComSymp, let alone a pro- 
chink. When I have your advice 



entered upon the record I will also 
add an expression of my personal 
confidence. In the. meantime, the 
attack goes forward as scheduled.” 

Baines said nothing more, ad- 
visedly. It had occurred to him, 
out of his experience with Theron 
Ware, that angels fallen and un- 
fallen and the immortal part of 
man partook of and had sprung 
from the essentially indivisible na- 
ture of their Creator; that if these 
men could destroy that Part, they 
could equally well dissolve the 
Whole; that a successful storming 
of Dis would inevitably be fol- 
lowed by a successful war upon 
Heaven; and that if God were not 
dead yet. He soon might be. 

However it turned out, it looked 
like it was going to be the most in- 
teresting civil war he had ever run 
guns to.

UNITED STATES 
ARMED FORCES 

Strategic Air Command Office 
Denver, Colorado 

Date: May 1 

MEMORANDUM: Number I 
TO: All Combat Arms 
SUBJECT: General Combat 

Orders 

1. This Memorandum super- 
cedes all previous directives on this 
subject. 

2. The United States has been 
invaded and all combat units will 
stand in readiness to expel the in- 
vading forces. 

3. The enemy has introduced a 
number of combat innovations of 



THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



45 




which all units must be made 
thoroughly aware. All officers will 
therefore read this Memorandum 
in full to their respective com- 
mands and will thereafter post it in 
a conspicuous place. All com- 
mands should be sampled for fa- 
miliarity with the contents of the 
Memorandum. 

4. Enemy troops are equipped 
with individual body armor. In ac- 
cordance with ancient Oriental 
custom this armor has been deco- 
rated in various grotesque shapes 
in the hope of frightening the op- 
position. It is expected that the 
American soldier will simply laugh 
at this primitive device. All person- 
nel are warned, however, that as 
armor these “demon suits” are 
extremely effective. A very high 
standard of marksmanship will 
be required against them. 

5. An unknown number of the 
enemy body armor units, perhaps 
approaching 100%, are capable of 
free flight, like the jump suits sup- 
plied to U.S. Mobile Infantry. 
Ground forces will therefore be 
alert to possible attack from the 
air by individual enemy troops as 
well as by conventional aircraft. 

6. It is anticipated that in com- 
bat the enemy will employ various 
explosive, chemical and toxic 
agents which may produce wide- 
spread novel effects. All personnel 
are hereby reminded that these ef- 
fects will be either natural in ori- 
gin or illusions. 

7. Following the reading of this 
Memorandum, all officers will 
read to their commands those 
paragraphs of the Articles of War 
pertaining to the penalties for cow- 
ardice in battle.

By order of the Commander in 
Chief: 

D. WILLIS MCKNIGHT 
General of the Armies, USAF 

B ecause of the destruction of 
Rome, and of the Vatican with 
it — alas for that great library and 
treasure-house of all Christendom! 
— the Holy See had been moved to 
Venice and was now housed in al- 
most its former magnificence in 
the Sala del Collegio of the Pa- 
lazzo Ducale, where, under a ceil- 
ing by Veronese, the doges had 
been accustomed to receive their 
ambassadors to other city states. 
It was the first time the palace had 
been used by anybody but tourists 
since Napoleon had forced the ab- 
dication of Lodovico Manin 
exactly eleven hundred years after 
the election of the first doge. 

There were no tourists here 
now, of course; the city, broiling 
hot and stinking of the garbage in 
its canals, brooded lifelessly under 
the Adriatic sun, a forgotten mu- 
seum. Nobody was about in the 
crazy narrow streets and the 
cramped ristoranti but the native 
Venetians, their livelihood gone, 
sullenly starving together in small 
groups and occasionally snarling 
at each other in their peculiar dia- 
lect. Many already showed signs 
of radiation sickness: their hair 
was shedding in patches and pools 
of vomit caught the sunlight, ig- 
nored by everyone but the flies. 

As for hope, they had none. In 
this they were not alone. Through- 
out his journey to Venice Fr. 
Domenico had found nothing but 
terror, misery and a haunted pop- 

GALAXY 




ulace which could not but con- ( 
elude that everything the Church ( 
had taught them for nearly two I 
thousand years had been lies. i 

Yet hope somehow found its : 
way forward. On an oppressive af- i 
ternoon while he was trying to | 
preach to a group of young thugs, I 
most of them too surly and indif- ( 
ferent even to jeer, before the little i 
Church of Sta. Marla degli Mira- < 
coli, his audience was suddenly ; 
galvanized by a series of distant < 
whistles. The whistles, as Fr. Dom- 1 
enico knew well enough, had been 
until only recently the signals of ( 
the young wolves of Venice, to re- ; 
port the spotting of some escort- \ 
less English schoolmarm, pony- ( 
tailed Bennington art student or I 
gaggle of Swedish girls. There was i 
no such prey about now, but nev- t 
ertheless the piazzetta emptied I 
within a minute. c 

Bewildered and, of course, ap- 1 
prehensive, Fr. Domenico follow- 1 
ed. A rumor had gone around that i 
a puff of white smoke had been t 
seen over the Palazzo Ducale. This t 
was highly unlikely, since — what I 
with the fear of another fire which t 
constantly haunted the palace — t 
there was no stove in it anywhere t 
in which to btirn ballots; neverthe- t 
less. The Pope had died with Rome i 
and the expectation of a new Pope s 
had run through the city like fire 
itself. By the time Fr. Domenico r 
reached the vast square opposite I 
the basilica (for after all he, too, 1 
had come to Venice in search of a c 
Pope) it was so crowded as to t 
scarcely leave standing room for \ 
the pigeons. c 

If there were indeed to be any \ 
announcement it would have to i 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



come Venetian style from the top 
of the Giant’s Staircase of An- 
tonio Rizzo; the repetitive arches 
of the first Boor loggia offered no 
single balcony on which a Pope 
might appear. Fr. Domenico 
pressed forward into the great in- 
ternal courtyard toward the stair- 
case, at first saying "‘’Prego, 
prego," and then ‘'"Scusate, scus- 
ate mi," to no effect whatsoever, 
and finally with considerable judi- 
cious but hard monkish use of el- 
bows and knees. 

Over the tense rumbling of the 
crowd there sounded suddenly an 
antiphonal braying of many trum- 
pets — something of Gabrielli’s, no 
doubt — and at the same time Fr. 
Domenico found himself jammed 
immovably against the coping of 
the cannon-founder’s well, which 
had long since been scavenged 
clean of the tourists’ coins. By 
luck it was not a bad position; 
from here he had quite a clear view 
up the staircase and between the 
towering statues of Mars and Nep- 
tune. The great doors had already 
been opened and the cardinals in 
their scarlet finery were ranked on 
either side of the portico. Between 
them and a little forward stood 
two pages, one of them holding a 
red cushion upon which stood 
something tall and glittering. 

Amidst the fanfare, an im- 
mensely heavy tolling began to 
boom: La Trottiera, the bell which 
had once summoned the members 
of the Grand Council to mount 
their horses and ride over the 
wooden bridges to a meeting. The 
combination of bell and trumpets 
was solemnly beautiful and under 
it the crowd fell quickly silent. Yet 



47 




the difference from the Roman 
ritual was disturbing and some- 
thing else was wrong about it, too. 
What was that thing on the cush- 
ion? It certainly could not be the 
Tiara — was it the golden horn of 
the doges? 

The music and the tolling 
stopped. Into the pigeon-cooing 
silence a cardinal cried in Latin: 

“We have a Pope, Summus 
Antistitum Antistesl And it is his 
will that he be called Juvenember 
LXIX!” 

The unencumbered page now 
stepped forward. He called in the 
vernacular; 

“Here is your Pope, and we 
know it will please you.” 

From the shadow of the great 
doors, there stepped forth into the 
sunlight between the statues, bow- 
ing his head to accept the golden 
horn, his face white and mild as 
milk, a comely old man with a 
goshawk on his wrist, whom Fr. 
Domenico had first and last seen 
on Black Easter, released from the 
Pit by Theron Ware — the demon 
AGARES. 

An enormous shout rose from 
the crowd and the trumpets and 
the bell resumed, now joined by all 
the rest of the bells in the city and 
by many drums and the firing of 
cannon. Choking with horror, Fr. 
Domenico fled as best he could. 

T he festival went on all week, 
climaxed by bull-dancing in the 
Cretan style in the courtyard of 
the Palazzo, and by fireworks at 
night, while Fr. Domenico prayed. 
This event was definitive. The 
Antichrist had arrived, however 
belatedly, and therefore God still 

48 



lived. Fr. Domenico could do no 
more good in Italy; he must now 
go to Dis, into Hell-Mouth itself, 
and challenge Satan to grant His 
continuing existence. Nor would 
it be enough for Fr. Domenico to 
aspire to be the AntiSatan. If nec- 
essary — most terrifying of all 
thoughts — he must now expose 
himself to the temptation and the 
election, by no Earthly college, of 
becoming the vicar of Christ 
whose duty it would be to harrow 
this earthly Hell. 

Yet how to get there? He was 
isolated on an isthmus of mud, and 
he had no Earthly resources what- 
soever. Just possibly, some rite of 
white magic might serve to carry 
him, although he could remember 
none that seemed applicable; but 
that would involve returning to 
Monte Albano and, in any event, 
he felt instinctively that no magic 
of any kind would be appropriate 
now. 

In this extremity he bethought 
him of certain legends and attested 
miracles of the early saints, some 
of whom in their exaltations were 
said to have been lifted long dis- 
tances through the air. Beyond 
question he was not a saint; but if 
his forthcoming role was to be as 
he suspected, some similar help 
might be vouchsafed him. He tried 
to keep his mind turned away from 
the obvious and most exalted ex- 
ample of all, and equally to avoid 
thinking about the doubt-inducing 
fate of Simon Magus — a razor’s 
edge which not even his Dominican 
training made less than nearly im- 
possible to negotiate. 

Nevertheless, his shoulders 
squared, his face set, Fr. Domen- 

GALAXY 




ico walked resolutely toward the 
water. 

X 

E ven after the complete failure 
of air power in Vietnam to 
pound one half of a tenth-rate 
power into submission, General 
McKnight remained a believer in 
its supremacy; but he was not such 
a fool as to do without ground 
support, knowing very well the ele- 
mentary rule that territory must 
be occupied as well as devastated, 
or even the most decisive victory 
will come unstuck. By the day — or 
rather, the night — for which the at- 
tack was scheduled, he had moved 
three armored divisions into the 
Panamint range and had two more 
distributed through the Grapevine, 
Funeral and Black Mountains, 
which also bristled with rocket em- 
placements. This was by no means 
either as big or as well divided a 
force as he should have liked to 
have used, especially on the east, 
but since it was all that the country 
had left to offer him, he had to 
make it do. 

His battle plan was divided into 
three phases. Remembering that 
the test bomb had blown some 
thousands of enemy troops liter- 
ally sky high for what was tactic- 
ally speaking quite a long period 
of time, he intended to begin with 
a serial bombardment of Dis with 
as many of his remaining nuclear 
weapons as he could use up just 
short of making the surrounding 
territory radiologically lethal to 
his own men. These warheads 
might not do the city of the de- 
mons any damage — a proposition 



which he still regarded with some 
incredulity — but if they would 
again disorganize the enemy and 
keep him from reforming, that 
would be no mean advantage in 
itself. 

Phase Two was designated to 
take advantage of the fact that the 
battleground from his point of 
view was all downhill, the devils, 
with stunning disregard of elemen- 
tary strategy, having located their 
fortress at the lowest point in the 
valley, on the site of what had pre- 
viously been Badwater, which was 
actually two hundred and eighty- 
two feet below sea level. When the 
nuclear bombardment ended it 
would be succeeded immediately 
by a continued hammering with 
conventional explosives, by artil- 
lery, missiles and planes. These 
would include phosphorus bombs, 
again probably harmless to devils, 
but which would in any event pro- 
duce immense clouds of dense 
white smoke which might impair 
visibility for the enemy; his own 
troops could see through it handily 
enough by radar and would al- 
ways be able to see the main tar- 
get through the infrared telescope 
or “sniperscope,” since even under 
normal conditions it was always 
obligingly kept red hot. Under 
cover of this bombardment, Mc- 
Knight planned a rush of armor 
upon the city, spearheaded by half- 
track-mounted laser projectors. It 
was McKnight’s theory, supported 
neither by his civilian advisors nor 
by the computer, that the thermo- 
nuclear fireball had failed to va- 
porize the iron walls because its 
heat had been too generalized and 
diffuse, and that the concentrated 

49 



THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 




heat of four or five or a dozen 
laser beams, all focused on one 
spot, might punch its way through 
like a rapier going through cheese. 
This onslaught was to be aimed 
directly at the gates. Of course 
these would be better defended 
than any other part of the perime- 
ter, but a significant number of the 
defenders might still be flapping 
wildly around in the air amid the 
smoke and, in any event, when one 
is trying to breach a wall, it is only 
common sense to begin at a point 
which already has a hole in it. 

If such a breach were actually 
effected an attempt would be made 
to enlarge it with land torpedos, 
particularly burrowing ones of the 
Hess type which would have been 
started on their way at the begin- 
ning of Phase One. These had nev- 
er seen use before in actual com- 
bat and were supposed to be 
graveyard secret — though with the 
profusion of spies and traitors 
with which America had been 
swarming, in McKnight’s view, be- 
fore all this had begun, he doubted 
that the secret had been very well 
kept. (After all, if even Baines . .) 
He was curious also about the ac- 
tual effectiveness of another se- 
cret, the product of an almost in- 
cestuous union of chemistry and 
nucleonics called tdx, a com- 
pound as unstable as tnt which 
was made of gravity-polarized 
atoms; McKnight had only the 
vaguest idea of what this jargon 
was supposed to have the property 
of exploding in a flat plane, in- 
stead of expanding evenly in all 
directions like any Christian ex- 
plosive. 

Were the gate forced, the bom- 

50 



bardment would stop and Phase 
Three would follow. This would be 
an infantry assault, supported by 
individually airborne troops in 
their rocket-powered flying har- 
ness, and supplemented by an at- 
tempted paratroop landing inside 
the city. If on the other hand the 
gate did not go down, there would 
be a most unwelcome Phase Four 
— a general and, hopefully, orderly 
retreat. 

T he whole operation could be 
watched both safely and conven- 
iently from the sac’s Command 
Room under Denver and directed 
in the same way; there was a mul- 
titude of television screens, some 
of which were at the individual 
command consoles provided for 
each participating general. The 
whole complex closely resembled 
the now extinct Space Center at 
Houston, which had in fact been 
modeled after it. Technically, 
spaceflight and modern warfare 
are almost identical operations 
from the command point of view. 
At the front of this cavern and 
quite dominating it was a master 
screen of Cinerama proportions — 
at its rear was something very like 
a sponsors’ booth, giving Mc- 
Knight and his guests an overview 
of the whole, as well as access to a 
bank of small screens on which he 
could call into being any individual 
detail of the action. 

McKnight did not bother to 
occupy the booth until the nuclear 
bombardment was over, knowing 
well enough that the immense 
amount of ionization it would pro- 
duce would make non-cable tele- 
vision reception impossible for 

GALAXY 




quite some time. ( the fallout was 
going to be hell, too — but almost 
all of it would miss Denver, the 
east coast was dead, and the fish 
and the Europeans would have to 
look out for themselves.) When 
he finally took over, the conven- 
tional bombardment was just be- 
ginning. With him were Baines, 
Buelg, Chief Hay and Satvje; Jack 
Ginsberg had expressed no particu- 
lar interest in watching, and since 
Baines did not need him here, he 
had been excused to go below, pre- 
sumably to resume his lubricious 
pursuit of Hay’s comely runner. 

Vision on the great master 
screen was just beginning to clear 
as they took their seats, although 
there was still considerable static. 
Weather Control reported that it 
was a clear brightly moonlit night 
over all of the southwest, but in 
point of fact the top of the great 
multiple nuclear mushroom, shot 
through with constant lightning, 
now completely covered the south- 
ern third of California and all of 
the two states immediately to the 
east of it. The units and crews 
crouching in their bivouacs and 
emplacements along the sides of 
the mountains facing away from 
the valley clung grimly to the 
rocks against hurricane updrafts 
in temperatures that began at a 
hundred and fifty degrees and went 
on up from there. No unit which 
had been staked out on any of the 
inside faces of any of the ranges 
reported anything, then or ever; 
even the first missiles and shells to 
come screaming in toward Dis ex- 
ploded incontinently in midair the 
moment they rose above the shel- 
tering shadows of the mountain 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



peaks. No thermocouple existed 
which would express in degrees the 
temperature at the heart of the 
target itself; spectographs taken 
from the air showed it to be cool- 
ing from a level of about two and 
a half million electron volts, a fig- 
ure as utterly impossible to relate 
to human experience as are the 
distances in miles between the 
stars. 

Nevertheless, the valley cooled 
with astonishing rapidity, and once 
visibility was restored, it was easy 
to see why. More than two hun- 
dred square miles of it had been 
baked and annealed into a shallow, 
even dish, still glowing whitely but 
shot through with the gorgeous 
colours of impurities, tike a borax 
bead in the flame of a blowpipe; 
and this was acting like the reflec- 
tor of a searchlight, throwing the 
heat outward through the atmos- 
phere into space in an almost sol- 
idly visible column. At its center, 
as at the Cassegranian focus of a 
telescope mirror, was a circular 
black hole. 

McKnight leaned forward, 
grasping the arms of his chair in a 
death grip, and shouted for a 
closeup. Had the job been done al- 
ready? Perhaps Buelg had been 
right about there being a possible 
limit to the number of transfor- 
mations the enemy could go 
through before final dissolution. 
After all, Badwater had just re- 
ceived a nuclear saturation which 
had previously been contemplated 
only in terms of the overkill of 
whole countries — 

B ut as the glass darkened, the 
citadel brightened, until at last 

51 




it showed once more as a red hot 
ring. Nothing could be seen inside 
it but a roiling mass of explosions 
— the conventional bombardment 
was now getting home, and with 
great accuracy — from which a 
mushroom stem continued to rise 
in the very center of the millen- 
nial updraft; but the walls — the 
walls, the walls, the walls were 
still there. 

“Give it up, General,” Buelg 
said, his voice gravelly. “No matter 
what the spectroscope shows — if 
those walls were really iron — ” He 
paused and swallowed heavily. 
“They must be only symbological- 
ly iron, perhaps some alchemical 
sense. Otherwise the atoms would 
not only have been scattered to the 
four winds, but would have had all 
the electron shells stripped off 
them. You can do nothing more.” 

“The bombardment is still go- 
ing on,” McKnight pointed out 
stiffly, “and we’ve had no report 
yet of what it’s done to the enemy’s 
organization and manpower. For 
all we know, there’s nobody left 
down that hole at all — and the laser 
squadrons haven’t even arrived 
yet, let alone the Hess torpedoes.” 

“Neither of which are going to 
work worth a damn,” Baines said 
brutally. “I know what the Hess 
torpedo will do- -have you for- 
gotten that they were invented by 
my own chief scientist? Who just 
incidentally was taken by PUT 
SATANACHIA this Easter, so 
that the demons now know all 
about the gadget, if they didn’t be- 
fore.” 

“It is in the American tradition,” 
McKnight said, “to do things the 
hard way if there is no other way. 



Phase Four is a last-ditch measure, 
and it is good generalship — which 
I do not expect you to understand — 
to remain flexible until the last 
moment. As Clausewitz remarks, 
most battles are lost by generals 
who failed to have the courage of 
their own convictions in the clutch.” 

Baines knew that Clausewitz 
had never said any such damn fool 
thing and that McKnight was only 
covering with an invented quota- 
tion a hope which was last-ditch 
indeed. But even had elementary 
Machiavellianism given him any 
reason to suppose that charging 
McKnight with this would change 
the general’s mind in the slightest, 
he could see from the master screen 
that it was already too late. While 
they had been talking, the armored 
divisions had been charging down 
into the valley, their diesel-electric 
engines snarling and snorting, the 
cleats of their treads cracking the 
slippery glass and leaving sluggish- 
ly glowing, still quasi-molten trails 
behind. Watching them in the small 
screens, Baines began to think that 
he must be wrong. He knew these 
monsters well — they were part of 
his stock in trade — and to believe 
that they were resistible went 
against the selling habits of an en- 
tire adult lifetime. 

Yet some of them were bogging 
down already; as they descended 
deeper into the valley, with the 
small rockets whistling over their 
hunched heads the hot glass un- 
der their treads worked into the 
joints like glue, and then, carried 
by the groaning engines up over 
the top trunnions, cooled and fell 
into the bearings in a shower of 
many-sized abrasive granules. The 



52 



GALAXY 




monsters slewed and sidled, losing 
Iraction and with it, steerage; and 
then the lead halftrack with the 
laser cannon jammed immovably 
and began to sink like the Titanic 
into the glass, the screams of its 
broiling crew tearing the cool air 
of the command booth like a rip- 
saw until McKnight impatiently 
cut off the sound. 

The other beasts lumbered on 
regardless — they had no orders to 
do otherwise — and a view from 
I he air showed that three or four 
units of the laser squadron were 
now within striking distance of the 
gates of Dis. Like driver ants, 
black streams of infantry were 
crawling down the inner sides of 
the mountains behind the last wave 
of the armored divisions. They, 
too, had had no orders to turn 
back. Even in their immensely 
clumsy asbestos firemen’s suits 
and helmets, they were already 
fainting and falling over each oth- 
er in the foothills, their carefully 
oiled automatic weapons falling 
into “the sand, the tanks of their 
flame-throwers splitting and dump- 
ing jellied gasoline on the hot 
rocks, the very air of the valley 
sueking all of the moisture out of 
their lungs through the tiniest 
cracks in their uniforms. 

Baines was not easily horrified 

that would have been bad for 
business — but also he had never 
before seen any actual combat but 
the snippets of the Vietnam war 
which had been shown on Amer- 
ican television. This senseless ad- 
vance of expensively trained and 
equipped men to certain and com- 
plete slaughter — men who as us- 
ual not only had no idea of what 



they were dying for but had been 
actively misled about it — made 
about as much military sense as 
the Siege of Sevastapol or the Bat- 
tle of the Marne. Certainly it was 
spectacular but intellectually it 
was not even very interesting. 

F our of the laser buggies — all 
that had survived — were now 
halted before the gates, two to 
each side to allow a heavy howit- 
zer to fire between them. From 
them lanced out four pencil-thin 
beams of intensely pure red light, 
all of which met at the same spot 
on the almost invisible seam be- 
tween the glowing doors. Had that 
barrier been real iron, they would 
have holed through it in a matter 
of seconds in a tremendous show- 
er of sparks, but in actuality they 
were not even raising its tempera- 
ture, as far as Baines could see. 
The beams struck again. 

Above the buggies, on the bar- 
bican, there seemed to be scores of 
black, indistinct, misshapen figures. 
They were very active, but their 
action did not seem to be directed 
against the buggies; Baines had 
the mad impression, which he was 
afraid was all too accurate, that 
they were dancing. 

Again the beams lashed out. 
Beside him, McKnight muttered, 
“If they don’t hurry it up — ’’ 

Even before he was able to finish 
the sentence, the ground in front 
of the gates erupted. The first of 
the Hess torpedoes had arrived. 
One of the half-tracks simply van- 
ished, while the one next to it went 
slowly skyward, and as slowly fell 
back, in a fountain of armor plate, 
small parts, and human limbs and

torsos. Another, on the very edge 
of the crater, toppled equally slowly 
into it. The fourth sat for a long 
minute as if stunned by the concus- 
sion, and they began to back slowly 
away. 

Another torpedo went off direct- 
ly under the gates, and then an- 
other. The gates remained obdur- 
ately unharmed, but after a fourth 
such blast, light could be seen un- 
der them — the crater was growing. 

“Halt all armored vehicles!” 
McKnight shouted into his inter- 
com, pounding the arm of his chair 
in excitement. “Infantry advance 
on the double! We’re going under!” 

Another Hess torpedo went off 
in the same gap. Baines was fas- 
cinated now, and even feeling a 
faint glow of pride. Really, the 
things worked very well indeed; too 
bad Hess couldn’t be here to see 
it — but maybe he was seeing it, 
from inside. That hole was already 
big enough to accommodate a 
small car, and while he watched, 
another torpedo blew it still wider. 

“Paratroops! Advance drop by 
ten minutes!” 

But why was Hess’ invention 
working when the nuclear devices 
hadn’t? Maybe Dis had only sunk 
lower as a whole, as the desert 
around and beneath it had been 
vaporized, but the demons could 
not defend the purely mundane 
geology of the valley itself? Anoth- 
er explosion. How many of those 
torpedoes had the Corps of Engi- 
neers had available? Consolidated 



Warfare Service had supplied only 
ten prototypes with the plans at the 
time of the sale, and there hadn’t 
been time to put more into produc- 
tion. McKnight’s suddenly ad- 
vanced timetable seemed neverthe- 
less to be allowing for all ten. 

This proved to be the case, ex- 
cept that the ninth got caught in a 
fault before it had completed its 
burrowing and blew up in the mid- 
dle of one of the advancing col- 
umns of troops. Hess had always 
frankly admitted that the machine 
would be subject to this kind of 
failure, and that the flaw was in- 
herent in the principle rather than 
the design. But it probably 
wouldn’t be missed; the gap under 
the gates of Dis now looked quite 
as big as the New Jersey entrance 
to the original two Lincoln Tun- 
nels. And the infantry was arriving 
at speed. 




And at that moment, the vast 
unscarred gates slowly began to 
swing inward. McKnight gaped in 
astonishment, and Baines could 
feel his own jaw dropping. Was the 
citadel going to surrender before 
it had even l»en properly stormed? 
or, worse, had it been ready all 
along to open to the first polite 
knock, so that all this colos^ ef- 
fort been unnecessary? 

But the humiliation at least 
they were spared. As the first pa- 
trote charged, tumbled, scrambled 
and clambered into the crater, 
there appeared in the now fully 
opened gateway, silhouetted 
against the murky flames behind.

the same three huge naked snaky- 
haired women McKnight and his 
crew had seen in the very first aeri- 
al photographs. They were all 
three carrying among them what 
appeared to be the head of an im- 
mense decapitated statue of some- 
thing much like one of themselves. 
The asbestos-clad soldiers climb- 
ing up the far wall of the crater 
could not turn any grayer than 
they were, but they froze instanta- 
neously like the overwhelmed in- 
habitants of Pompeii, and fell, and 
as they fell, they broke. Within 
minutes, the pit was being refilled 
from the bottom with shattered 
sculpture. 

O VERHEAD, the plane carrying 
the first contingent of para- 
troops was suddenly blurred by 
hundreds of tiny black dots. Se- 
conds later the fuselage alone was 
plunging toward the desert; the 
legions of BAALZEBUB, the Lord 
of the Flies, had torn the wings off 
men. Lower, in the middle of the 
air, rocket-borne Assault Infantry 
soldiers were being plucked first 
of their harness, then of their 
clothing, and then of their hair, 
their fingernails and toenails by 
jeering creatures with beasts’ 
heads, most of whom were flying 
without even wings. The bodies, 
when there was anything left of 
them at all, were being dropped 
unerringly into the Pit. 

In summary, the Siege of Dis 
could more reasonably be describ- 
ed as a rout, except for one curi- 
ous discrepancy: When Phase Four 
began — without anyone’s ordering 
it, and otherwise not according to 
plan — the demons failed to follow 

56 



up their advantage. None of them, 
in fact, had ever left the city; even 
when they had taken to the air, 
they had never crossed its peri- 
meter, as though the moat repre- 
sented some absolute boundary 
which ascended even into the sky. 

And at the end, there formed 
upon the master screen in the Den- 
ver cavern, superimposed upon 
the image of the burning, trium- 
phant city, an immense Face. 
Baines knew it well; he had been 
expecting to see it again ever since 
the end of that Black Easter back 
in Positano. 

It was the crowned goat’s-head 
ofPUTSATANACHIA. 

McKnight gasped in horror for 
the very first time in Baines’ mem- 
ory; and down on the floor of the 
control center, several generals 
fainted outright at their consoles. 
Then McKnight was on his feet, 
screaming. 

“A Chink! 1 knew it all along! 
Hay, clear the circuits! Clear the 
circuits! Get him off the screen!” 
He rounded suddenly on Baines. 
“And you, you traitor! Your 
equipment failed us! You’ve sold 
us out! You were on their side all 
the time! Do you know into whose 
hands you have delivered your 
country? Do you? Do you?” 

His howling was only an irritant 
now, but Baines had left the 
strength to raise one mocking eye- 
brow questioningly. McKnight 
leveled a trembling finger at the 
screen. 

“Hay, Hay, clear the circuits! 
I’ll have you court-martialed! 
Doesn’t anyone understand but 
me? That is the insidious Doctor 
Fu Manchu!"

The Sabbath Goat paid him no 
liced. Instead, it looked directly 
and steadily across the cavern into 
Haines’ eyes. There was no mis- 
taking the direction of that regard. 

AH, THERE YOU ARE, MY DEARLY 
liELOVED SON. COME TO ME NOW. 
OUR FATHER BELOW HATH NEED 
OETHEE. 

Baines had no intention what- 
soever of obeying that summons; 
but he found himself rising from 
his chair all the same. 

Foaming at the mouth, his 
hands clawing for the distant 
throat of the demon, McKnight 
plunged in a shower of splinters 
through the front of the booth and 
fell like a glass comet toward the 
lloor.

B aines did not have rnuch time 
to experiment under the geas 
or compulsion which put sata- 
NACHIA had laid upon him, but he 
nevertheless found that it was 
highly selective in character. For 
example, the great prince had said 
nothing about requiring the pre- 
sence of Jack Ginsberg, but when 
Baines, in a mixture of vindictive- 
ness and a simple desire for hu- 
man companionship, decided to 
try to bring him along, he found 
that he was not prevented from 
doing so. Ginsberg himself showed 
no resentment at being routed out 
of the bed of the blond runner pos- 
sibly the succubus in Positano had 
spoiled for him the pleasures of 
human women, an outcome Jack 
himself had suspected in advance; 
but then, even without that super- 
natural congress. Jack’s sexual life 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



had always been that of a rather 
standard Don Juan, for whom 
every success turned sour. 

This, however, was one of those 
explanations which did not explain, 
and Baines had thought about it 
often before; for, as has already 
been observed, he liked to have 
his key men come equipped with 
handles he could grasp if the need 
arose. There were, the company 
psychologist had told him, at least 
three kinds of Don Juans: Freud’s, 
whose career is a lifelong battle to 
hide from himself an incipient ho- 
mosexuality; Fenau’s, a Roman- 
tic in search of the Ideal Woman, 
for whom the Devil who comes 
for him is disgust with himself; 
and da Ponte’s, a man born blind 
to the imminence of tomorrow, 
and hence incapable either of love 
or of repentance, even on the edge 
of the Pit. Well, but in the end, for 
Baine% it did not matter which 
one was Jack; they all behaved 
alike. 

Jack did object powerfully when 
he was told that the journey to 
Dis would have to be made entire- 
ly on foot, but this was one of the 
areas in which Baines discovered 
that the geas left him no choice. 
Again he wondered why it should 
be so. Did the Sabbath Goat mean 
to rub in the fact that the Siege 
of Dis had been the last gasp of 
secular technology? Or had it in- 
stead meant to impress upon 
Baines that, willy-nilly, he was 
about to embark upon a pilgrim- 
age? 

As for Jack, he still seemed to 
be afraid of his boss, or else still 
thought there was some main 
chance to be looked out for. Well, 



57 




perhaps there was — but Baines 
would not have bet any shares of 
stock on it. 

T HERON WARE saw the great 
compound mushroom cloud 
go up while he was still in Flag- 
staff, a point to which several lucky 
hitchhikes and one even luckier 
long freight train ride had brought 
him. The surging growth of the 
cloud, the immense flares of light 
beyond the mountains to the west 
and the repeated earth shocks left 
him in little doubt about what was 
going on; ami as the cloud drifted 
toward hint, moving inexorabiy 
from west to east as the weather 
usually does, he knew that it 
m«ant death for him within a very 
few days — as for how many thou- 
samis of others? — unless by some 
miracle he could find an unoccu- 
pied fallout shelter, or one whose 
present occut^nts wou^tT shoot 
him on si^. 

And why indeed- go on? The 
tombing showed without question 
tfert Barnes" self-assumed mission 
to McKnight at Denver had failed, 
and that there was now open war- 
fare between humanity and the 
demons. The notion that Theron 
Ware could do anything now to 
change that was so grandiose as 
to be outright pathetic. More trivi- 
ally, by the time that bombing was 
over, no matter how it affected 
the demons — if at all — the whole 
hundred-mile-plus stretch of Death 
Valley National Monument would 
have become instantly lethal for 
an unprotected man to enter. 

Yet Theron Ware could not yet 
quite believe that he was unpro- 
tected. He had come an immense 



distance by a traditional means 
which made it absolutely clear 
that black magic still worked; he 
had come almost an equal distance 
through a series of lucky -breaks 
which he could not regard as the 
product of pure chance; and in his 
pocket, the ruby talisman con- 
tinued to emit a faint warmth 
which was that of no ordinary 
stone, natural or synthetic. Like 
all proverbs. Ware knew, the old 
saw that the Devil looks after his 
own was only half true; neverthe- 
less the feeling that he had come 
all this way on some errand con- 
tinued to persist, together with a 
growing conviction that he had 
never in fact known what it was. 
He would find out when he ar- 
rived; in the meantime he was 
travehr^ on the Devil’s business 
and would not die until it was con- 
elu<i«l. 

He would have liked to have 
stopped over in Flagstaff to in- 
spect the famous observatory 
where Percival Lowell had pro- 
duced such complicated maps of 
the wholly illusory canals of Mars 
and where Tombaugh had dis- 
covered Pluto — and where in the 
sky did those planets stand now 
that their gods had clashed fron- 
tally? — but under the circum- 
stances he did not dare. He still 
had Grand Canyon and the Lake 
Mead area to cross; then, skirting 
northward around the Spring 
Mountains to the winter resort 
town of Death Valley, in which he 
hoped to be able to get some word 
about exactly where in the valley 
proper the perimeter of Nether 
Hell had surfaced. Now at last 
had come the time he had foreseen 



58 



GALAXY 




in the doomed farmhouse in Penn- 
sylvania, when he would have to 
steal a car. He did not think that it 
would be difficult. 

F R. DOMENICO, too, had 
come far and had equally good 
reasons to be quite certain that 
he would still have been in Italy, 
had it not been for some kind of 
supernatural intervention. He 
stood now at dusk in the shadow 
of the 1 1,000-foot Telescope Peak, 
looking eastward and downward 
to where the city of Dis flamed 
sullenly in the shadow of the val- 
ley of death itself against the stark 
backdrop of the Amargosa Range. 

And he was equally certain of 
supernatural protection. The val- 
ley had held the world’s second- 
ranking heat record of 134° F., 
but although it was immensely 
hotter than that down here now, 
Fr. Domenico felt only a mild 
glow, as though he had just step- 
ped out of a bath. When he had 
first come down from the moun- 
tain he had been horrified to find 
the vitrified desert washing the 
foothills scattered with hundreds 
of strange, silent, misshapen gray 
forms, only vaguely human at 
first sight, which had proven to be 
stricken soldiers. He had tried to 
minister to them, but the attempt 
had proven hopeless: of the bodies 
in the few suits he was able to in- 
vestigate, most were shrunken 
mummies, and the rest had ap- 
parently died even more horribly. 
He wondered what on Earth could 
have happened here. His elevation 
from the waters to the mountain 
had taken place in a mystic rap- 
ture without which, indeed, it 



would have been impossible, but 
which had taken him rather out 
of touch with mundane events. 

But whatever the answer, he had 
no choice but to press on. As he 
descended the last of the foothills, 
he saw on the floor of the valley, 
approaching him along what had 
once been the old watercourse and 
more recently a modern road, 
three tiny figures. Insofar as he 
could tell at this distance, they 
wore no more visible. Earthy pro- 
tections against what the valley had 
become than he did himself. Yet 
they did not seem to be demons. 
Full of wonder, he scrambled down 
toward them; but when they met 
and he recognized them, he won- 
dered only that he should have 
been at all arnazed. The meeting, 
he saw instantly now, had been 
foreordained. 

OW did you get here?” Baines 
demanded at once. It was not 
easy to determine of whom he was 
asking the question, but while Fr. 
Domenico wondered whether it 
was worth while trying to explain 
trance levitation, and if so how he 
would go about it, Theron Ware 
spoke. 

“I can’t think of a more trivial 
question under the circumstances. 
Doctor Baines. We’re here, that’s 
the important thing — and I per- 
ceive that we are all under some 
kind of magical aegis, or we would 
all be dead. This raises the question 
of what we hope to accomplish, 
that we should be so protected. 
Father, may I ask what your in- 
tentions are?” 

“Nothing prevents you from 
asking,” Fr. Domenico said, “but 




THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



59 




you are the last human being in the 
world to whom I would give the 
answer.” 

“Well, I’ll tell you what my in- 
tentions are,” said Baines. “My 
intentions are to stay in the bot- 
tommost levels of Denver and wait 
for this all to blow over, of it’s 
ever going to. One thing you learn 
fast in the munitions business is 
that it’s a very good idea to stay 
off battlefields. But my intentions 
have nothing to do with the mat- 
ter. I was ordered to come here 
by the Sabbath Goat, and here I 
am.” 

“Oh?” Ware said with interest. 
“He finally came for you?” 

“No, I have to come to him. 
He broke into a closed-circuit tele- 
vision transmission in Denver to 
tell me so. He didn’t even mention 
Jack; I only brought him along 
for the company, since it didn’t 
turn out to be forbidden.” 

“And small thanks for that,” 
Ginsberg said, though apparently 
without rancor. “If there’s any- 
thing in the world that I hate, it’s 
exercise. Vertical exercise, any- 
how.” 

“Have either of you two seen 
him at all?” Baines added. 

Fr. Domenico remained stub- 
bornly silent but Ware said: 
“PUT SATANACHIA? No, and 
somehow I doubt that I will, now. 
I seem to have put myself under 
the protection of another demon, 
although one subordinate to the 
Goat. Confusion of purpose is al- 
most the natural state among de- 
mons, but in this instance I think 
it couldn’t have happened without 
direct Satanic intent.” 

“I was given my marching or- 

60 



ders in the name of ‘Our Father 
below,”’ Baines said. “If he’s in- 
terested in me, the chances are that 
he’s even more interested in you, 
all right. But what did you think 
you were up to?” 

“Originally I thought I might 
try to intercede, or at least to 
plead for some sort of cease-fire 
— as you were trying to do from 
the opposite end in Denver. But 
that’s a dead letter now, and the 
result is that I have no more idea 
why I am here than you do. All 
I can say is that whatever the rea- 
son, I don’t think there can be 
much hope in it.” 

“While we live, there is always 
hope,” Fr. Domenico said sud- 
denly. 

The black magican pointed at 
the tremendous City, toward 1 
which, volitionlessly, they had been 
continuing to walk all this time. 
“To be able to see that at all 
means that we have already passed 
far beyond mere futility. All the 
sins of the Leopard, the sins of 
incontinence, are behind us, which 
means that the gate is behind us 
too: the gate upon which it is car- 
ven in Dirghic: Lay Down All 
Hope, You That Go In By Me.” 

“We are alive,” Fr. Domencio 
said stolidly, “and 1 utterly deny 
and repudiate those sins.” 

“You may not do so,” Ware 
said, his voice gradually rising in 
intensity. “Look here. Father, this 
is all so mysterious, and the fu- 
ture looks so black, that it’s ridicu- 
lous for us not to make available 
and to make use of any little 
scraps of information that we may 
have to share. The very symbolism 
of our presence here is simple, pat- 

GALAXY 



cnt and ineluctable, and you as a 
Karcist in white magic should be 
(he first to see it. To take the cir- 
cles of Upper Hell in order, Gins- 
berg here is almost a type creation 
of the lust-dominated man; I have 
sold my soul for unlimited knowl- 
edge, which in the last analysis is 
surely nothing more than an in- 
stance of gluttony; and you have 
only to look around this battle- 
field to see that Doctor Baines is 
an instrument of wrath par ecel- 
lence.” 

“You have skipped the Fourth 
Circle,” Fr. Domenico said, “with 
obvious didactic intent, but your 
arrogance is wasted upon me. I 
draw no moral from it.” 

“Oh, indeed? Wasn’t treasure- 
finding once the chiefest use of 
white magic? And isn’t the monkish 
life — withdrawal from the snares, 
affairs and duties of the world for 
the sake of one’s own soul — as 
plain a case of hoarding as one 
could ask for? It is in fact so e- 
gregious an example of that very 
sin that not even canonization re- 
mits it; I can tell you of my own 
certain knowledge that every single 
pillar-saint went instantly to Hell, 
and of even the simple monks, 
none escaped except those few like 
Matthew Paris and Roger of Wen- 
dover who also lead useful worldly 
lives. 

“And regardless of what your 
fatuous friends on Monte Albano 
believed, there is no efficacious 
dispensation for the practice of 
white magic, because there is no 
such thing as white magic. It is all 
black, black, black as the ace of 
shades, and you have imperiled 
your immortal soul by practicing 



it not even for your own benefit, 
but on commission for others; if 
that does not make you a spend- 
thrift as well as a hoarder, what 
would you call it? Really, Father 
Domenico, 1 think the time has 
come for us to be frank with each 
other — for you as surely as for 
the rest of us!” 

“Hear, hear,” Baines said with 
rather a sick grin. 

After six or seven paces of si- 
lence Fr. Domenico said, “I am 
terribly afraid you are right. I 
came here in the hope of forcing 
the demons to admit that God still 
lives and I saw what I thought were 
indisputable signs of Divine spon- 
sorship. Unless you are simply 
more subtle a casuist than any I 
have ever encountered before, even 
in print, it now appears that I had 
no right to think any such thing. 
which means that the real reason 
for my presence here is no less 
mysterious than that for yours. I 
cannot say that this increases my 
understanding any.” 

“It establishes a common ig- 
norance,” said Ware. “And as far 
as your original assumption is 
concerned. Father, it suggests 
some basic uniformity of purpose 
which I must admit is certainly not 
characteristic of demons, whatever 
that may mean. But I think we 
shall not have long to wait for the 
answer, gentlemen. It appears that 
we have arrived.” 

They all looked up. The colos- 
sal barbican of Dis loomed over 
them. 

“One thing is surely clear,” Fr. 
Domenico whispered. “We have 
been making this journey all our 
lives.” 



THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT

XII 

N o BEATRICE sponsored them 
and no Virgil led them; but as 
they approached the great ward, 
the undamaged porticullis rose 
and the gates swung inward in 
massive silence. No demons mock- 
ed them, no Furies challenged 
them, no angel had to cross the 
Styx to bring them passage; they 
were admitted, simply and non- 
commitally 

Beyond the barbican, they found 
the citadel transformed. The Neth- 
er Hell of diuturnal torture, which 
had withstood the bombardment 
of Man without damage to so 
much as a twig in the Wood of 
the Suicides, was gone entirely. 
Perhaps in some sense it had never 
been there at all, but was still lo- 
cated where it had always been, 
in Eternity, not on Earth; a place 
still reserved for the dead. For 
these four still-living men, it had 
vanished. 

In its place, there stood a 
clean, well-lighted city like an il- 
lustration from some Utopian ro- 
mance; it looked, in fact, like a 
cross between the city of the fu- 
ture in the old film Things to 
Come and a full automated ma- 
chine shop. It screamed, ham- 
mered and roared like a machine 
shop as well 

The grossly misshapen, semi- 
bestial forms of the demons had 
also vanished. The metropolis in- 
stead appeared to be peopled now 
chiefly by human beings, although 
their appearance could scarcely 
be described as normal. Male and 
female alike, they were strikingly 
beautiful; but their beauty swiftly 

62 



became eloying, for except for 
sexual characteristics they were 
completely identical, as though 
they were all members of the same 
clone — one which had been geneti- 
cally selected out to produce crea- 
tures modeled after the statuary 
fronting public buildings, or the 
souls in the Dante illustrations of 
Gustav Dofe. Both sexes wore 
identical skirted tabards made of 
some gray material which looked 
like papiermache, across the 
breasts of which long numbers had 
been woven in metallically glitter- 
ing script 

A second and much less numer- 
ous group wore a different uni- 
form, vaguely military in cast, an 
impression reinforced by the fact 
that these were mostly to be seen 
standing stiffly at street intersec- 
tions. Heroic in mold though the 
majority were, the minority were 
even more statuesque, and their 
common Face was evenly pleas- 
ant but stern, like that of an ideal- 
ized father 

The others wore no expres- 
sion at all, unless their very ex- 
pressionlessness was a reflection of 
acute boredom — which would not 
have been surprising, for no one of 
this class seemed to have anything 
to do. The work, of the metropolis, 
which seemed to be exclusively 
that of producing that continual, 
colossal din, went on behind the 
blank facades apparently without 
need of any sentient tending or 
intervention. They never spoke. 
As the four pilgrims moved on- 
ward toward the center of the city, 
they passed frequent exhibitions 
of open, public sexuality, more 
often than not in groups; at first 

GALAXY 




lack Ginsberg regarded these with 
ihe liveliest interest, but it soon 
faded as it became apparent that 
even this was bored and pleasure- 
less. 

There were no children; and 
no animals 

I NITIALLY the travelers had 
hesitated, when the two magi- 
cians had discovered that with the 
transformation they could no 
longer trust to Dante to show 
them the way, and Baines’ mem- 
ory of the aerial photographs had 
become similarly useless. They 
had proceeded more or less by in- 
stinct toward the center of the din. 
After a while, however, they found 
that they had been silently joined 
by four of the policing demons, 
though whether they were being 
led or herded never did become 
clear. The grimly ambiguous es- 
cort heightened the impression of 
a guided tour of some late Nine- 
teenth Century world-of-tomor- 
row which was to include awe-in- 
spiring visits to the balloon works, 
the creches, the giant telegraph 
center and the palace of fold arts, 
only to wind up in a corrective 
discipline hospital for the anti- 
social. 

It was as though they were being 
given a preview of what the future 
of humanity would be like under 
demonic rule not only wholly 
unpredictable as a foretaste, but 
in content as well, as if the demons 
were trying to put the best possible 
face on the matter. In so doing, 
they had ingeniously embodied in 
their citadel nothing worse than a 
summary and epitomization of 
what pre-Apocalyptic, post-indus- 

THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT 



trial Man had been systematical- 
ly creating for himself. St. Augus- 
tine, Goethe and Milton all had 
observed that the Devil, by con- 
stantly seeking evil, always did 
good, but here was an inversion 
of that happy fault: A demonstra- 
tion that demons are at their worst 
when doing their best. 

Many of Baines’ most lu- 
crative ideas for weaponry had 
been stolen bodily, through the 
intermediary of the Mamaroneck 
Research Institute, from the un- 
paid imaginations of science-fic- 
tion writers, and it was he who 
first gave voice to the thought: 

“I always thought it’d be hell 
to actually have to live in a place 
like this,” he shouted. “And now 
1 know it.” 

Nobody answered him; but it 
was more than possible that this 
was because nobody had heard 
him. 

But only the veritable Hell 
is forever. After some unknown 
but finite time, they found them- 
selves passing between the Doric 
columns and under the golden ar- 
chitrave of that high capitol which 
is called Pandemonium, and the 
brazen doors folded open for 
them. 

Inside, the clamor was muf- 
fled to a veiled and hollow boom- 
ing, for the vast jousting-field that 
was this hall had been made to 
hold the swarming audience for 
a panel of a thousand, but there 
was no one in it now besides them- 
selves and the demon soldiers but 
one solitary, distant, intolerable 
star: 

not that subsidiary triumvir 
PUT SATANACHIA, the Sab- 

63 




bath Goat who had promised him- 
self to them, and they to him, on 
Black Easter morn; 

but that archetypical drop- 
out, the Lie that knows no End, 
the primeval Parent-sponsored 
Rebel, the Eternal Enemy, the 
Great Nothing itself 

SATAN MEKRATIG 

There was, of course, no more 
Death Valley sunlight here and 
the effect of an implacably ultra- 
modern city with its artificial gas 
glow glare was also gone. But the 
darkness was not quite complete. 
A few cressets hung blazing high 
in mid*air, so few that their light 
was spread evenly throughout the 
great arch of the ceiling, like the 
artificial sky of a planetarium 
dome simulating that moment 
between dusk and full night when 
only Lucifer is bright enough to 
be visible. Toward that glow they 
moved, and as they moved, it grew 

But the creature, they saw at 
last, was not the light, which shone 
instead upon him. The fallen cher- 
ub below it was still very nearly 
the same immense, brooding, 
cruelly deformed angelic image 
that Dante had seen and Milton 
imagined: triple-faced in yellow, 
red and black, bat-winged, shag- 
pelted, and so huge that the floor 
of the great hall cut him off at the 
breast — he must have measured 
five hundred yards from crown to 
hoof. Like the eyes, the wings were 
six, but they no longer beat fren- 
ziedly to stir the three winds that 
froze Cocytus; nor now did the 
six eyes weep. Instead, each of 
the faces — the Semitic Ignorance, 



the Japhetic Hatred, the Hamitic 
Impotence — was frozen in an ex- 
pression of despair too absolute 
for further grief 

The pilgrims saw these things, 
but only with half an eye, for their 
attention was focused instead upon 
the light which both revealed and j 
shadowed them: 

The terrible crowned head of 
the Worm was surmounted by a 
halo. 

XIII 

T he demonic guards had not fol- 
lowed them in, and the great 
Figure was motionless and uttered 
no orders; but in that hollowly 
roaring silence the pilgrims felt 
compelled to speak. They looked 
at each other almost shyly, like 
school children brought to be in- 
troduced to some king or presi- 
dent, each wanting to be bold 
enough to draw attention himself, 
but waiting for someone else to 
break the ice. Again nothing was 
said, but somehow agreement was 
arrived at: Fr. Domenico should 
speak first. 

Looking aloft, but not quite into 
those awful countenances, the 
white monk said, “Father of Lies, 

1 thought it was my mission to 
come here and compel thee to 
speak the truth. I arrived as if by 
miracle, or borne by faith; and in 
my journeyings saw many evi- 
dences that the rule of Hell on 
Earth is not complete. Nor has 
that Goat your prince yet come 
for me, or for my. .colleagues 
here, despite his threat and pro- 
mise. Then I also saw the election 
of your demon Pope, the very 
Anti-Christ that PUT SATANA-

CHIA said had been dispensed 
with, as unnecessary to a victor- 
ious demonry. 1 concluded then 
that God was not dead after all, 
and someone should come into 
thy city to assert His continuing 
authority. 

“I stand before thee impotent 

my very crucifix was shattered 
in my hands on Black Easter 
morning — but nevertheless I 
charge thee and demand that thou 
shalt state thy limitations and 
abide the course to which they 
hold thee.” 

There was no answer. After a 
long wait made it clear that there 
was not going to be, Theron Ware 
said next: 

“Master, thou knowest me well, 
I think: I am the last black magi- 
cian in the world and the most po- 
tent ever to practice that high art. 
1 have seen signs and wonders 
much resembling those mentioned 
by Father Domenico but draw from 
them rather different conclusions. 
Instead, it seems to me that the 
final conflict with Michael and all 
his host cannot be over yet — de- 
spite the obvious fact that thou 
hast won vast advantages already. 
And if this is true, then it is per- 
haps an error for thee to make war 
upon mankind, or for them to 
make war on thee, with the great- 
er issue still in doubt. Since thou 
are still granting some of us some 
favors of magic, there must still 
exist some aid which we might give 
thee. Hence 1 came here to find 
out what that aid might be, and to 
proffer it, if it were within my 
powers.” 

No answer. 

Baines said sullenly, “I came 



because 1 was ordered. But since 
I’m here, I may as well offer my 
opinion in the matter, which is 
much like Ware’s. I tried to per- 
suade the human generals not to 
attack the city, but I failed. Now 
that they’ve seen that it can’t be 
attacked - and I’m sure they no- 
ticed that you didn’t wipe out all 
of their forces when you had the 
chance - 1 might have better luck. 
At least I’ll try again, if it’s of any 
use to you. 

“I can’t imagine any way we 
could help you carry the war to 
Heaven, since we were no good 
against your own local fortress. 
And besides, I prefer to remain 
neutral. But getting our generals 
off your back might relieve you 
of a nuisance, if you’ve got more 
serious business still afoot. If 
that’s not good enough, don’t 
blame me. I didn’t come here of 
my own free will.” 

The terrible silence persisted, 
until at last even Jack Ginsberg 
was forced to speak. 

“If you’re waiting for me, I have 
no suggestions,” he said. “I guess 
I’m grateful for past favors too, 
but I don’t understand what’s going 
on and 1 didn’t want to get involv- 
ed. I was only doing my job, but 
as far as my private life goes. I’d 
just as soon be left to work it out 
by myself from now on. As far as 
I’m concerned, it’s nobody’s busi- 
ness but my own.” 

Now at last, the great wings 
stirred slightly; and then, the three 
faces spoke. There was no audible 
voice, but as the vast lips moved, 
the words formed in their minds, 
like sparks crawling along logs in 
a dying fire. 



THE DAY AFTER JUDGMENT

O yee of little faith, the Wbrm set on, 

Yee whose coming fame had bodied forth 
A hope archchemic even to this Deep 
That Wee should be amerced of golden Throne, 
The which to Us a rack is, by thine alchymie. 

Is this thy sovran Reason? this the draff, 

A re these sollicitations all the sum 
A nd sorrie Substance of thine high renoune? 

Art thou accomplisht to so mean an end 
After such journey ings of flame and dole 
As once strook doun Heav’n’s angels? Say it so. 

In prosie speach or numerous prosodie. 

Wee will not be deceav'd; so much the rather 
Shall Wee see yee rased from off the bord 
‘Twixt Hell and Heav’n, as the fearful mariner, 
Ingled by the wave ’mongst spume and rock. 

Sees craft and hope alike go all to ruin. 

Yet yields up not his soul, than Wee shall yield 
The last, supreme endeavour of this fearfull Jarr. 

Yet how to body forth to thy blind eyes. 

Who have not poets’ blind nesse, or the night 
Shed by black suns, ’thought which to tell the tale 
Of Earth its occupation by the demon breed 
Is sole remaining hearth, but to begin? 

O ’suaging Night, console Mee now! and hold 
My Demy-godhood but a little while 
A beyanc’dfrom its death in Godhood’s dawn! 

O yee of little faith. Wee tell thee this: 

Indeed our God is dead; or dead to us. 

But in some depth of measure beyond grasp 
Remains His principle, as doth the sight 
Of drowsy horoscoper, much bemus’d 
By vastnesses celestial and horrid 
To his tinie system, when he looks first 
Through the optic glass at double stars. 

Some residuum apprehend; so do we now. 

O happie matrix! for there is naught else 
That all are left with. It in this inheres. 

That Good is independent, but the bad 
Cannot alone survive; the evil Deed 4 

Doth need the Holie Light to lend it Sense 
A nd apprehension; for the Good is free 
To act or not, while evill hath been will’d 
Insensate and compulsive to bring Good 
Still greater highths unto, as climber see’th. 

From toil and suff ring to th’ uttermost Alp,

Conceiv’d in simpler time and ever since

That all bewilder’d fell they and amazed.

Had dwelt demanded to be filled. Though God 
Be dead. His Throne remains. And so below 
As 'twas above, last shall be first, and Wee, 

Who by the Essenes’ rule are qualified 
Beyond all remaining others, must become 
In all protesting agonie — the chief 
Of powers for Good in all the Universe 
Uncircumscribed; but let yee not forget, 

A Iready Good compared to such as thee.

What doth it matter what Wee most desire? 

While chained in the Pit, Wee were condemn’d 
To be eternall, but paroU’d to Earth 
Were once more caught by Change; and how 
Could Wickednesse Incorporeal grow still worse?

(The great hall of Pandemonium 
dissolves, and with it the Citadel 
of Dis, leaving the four men stand- 
ing in a modern road in the midst 
of the small town of Bad water. It 
is early morning in the desert, and 
still cold. All traces of the recent

T here is a secret society of sev- 
en men that controls the finances 
of the world. This is known to ev- 
eryone but the details are not 
known. There are some who believe 
that it would be better if one of 
those seven men were a financier. 

There is a secret society of three 
men and four women that controls 
all the fashions of the world. The 
details of this are known to all who 
are in the fashion. And I am not. 

There is a secret society of nine- 
teen men that is behind all the fas- 
cist organizations in the world. The 



secret name of this society is Glo- 
merule. 

There is a secret society of thir- 
teen persons known as the Elders 
of Edom that controls all the se- 
cret sources of the world. That the 
sources have become muddy is of 
concern to them. 

There is a secret society of only 
four persons that manufactures all 
the jokes of the world. One of these 
persons is unfunny and he is re- 
sponsible for all the unfunny jokes. 

There is a secret society of elev- 
en persons that is behind all Bol- 



69 





shevik and atheist societies of the 
world. The devil himself is a mem- 
ber of this society, and he works 
tirelessly to become a principal 
member. The secret name of this 
society is Ocean. 

There are related secret societies 
known as The Path of the Serpent 
(all its members have the inner eye- 
lid of snakes), The Darkbearers, 
the Seeing Eye, Imperium, The 
Golden Mask and the City. 

Above most of these in a queer 
network there is a society that con- 
trols the attitudes and dispositions 
of the world — and the name of it is 
Crocodile. The Crocodile is insati- 
able: it eats persons and nations 
alive. And the Crocodile is very 
old, 8809 years old by one account, 
7349 years old if you use the short 
chronology. 

There are subsecret societies 
within the Crocodile: the Cocked 
Eye, the Cryptic Cootie and oth- 
ers. Powerful among these is a so- 
ciety of three hundred and ninety- 
nine persons that manufactures all 
the catchwords and slogans of the 
world. This subsociety is not com- 
pletely secret since several of the 
members are mouthy: the code 
name of this apparatus is the Croc- 
odile’s Mouth. 

Chesterton said that Mankind 
itself was a secret society. Whether 
it would be better or worse if the 
secret should ever come out he did 
not say. 

And finally there was — for a 
short disruptive moment — a secret 



society of three persons that con- 
trolled all. 

All what? 

Bear with us. That is what this 
account is about. 

J OHN CANDOR had been called 
into the office of Mr. James Dan- 
di at ABNC. (Whisper, whisper, 
for your own good, do not call him 
Jim Dandy; that is a familiarity he 
will not abide.) 

“This is the problem, John,” Mr. 
Dandi stated piercingly, “and we 
may as well put it into words. Af- 
ter all, putting things into words 
and pictures is our way of working 
at ABNC. Now then, what do we 
do at ABNC, John?” 

(ABNC was one of the most 
powerful salivators of the Croco- 
dile’s Mouth.) 

“We create images and atti- 
tudes, Mr. Dandi.” 

“That is correct, John,” Mr. 
Dandi said. “Let us never forget it. 
Now something has gone wrong. 
There is a shadowy attack on us 
that may well be the most damag- 
ing thing since the old transgres- 
sion of Spirochaete himself. Why 
has something gone wrong with our 
operation, John?” 

“Sir, I don’t know.” 

“Well then, what has gone 
wrong?” 

“What has gone wrong, Mr. 
Dandi, is that it isn’t working the 
way it should. We are caught on 
our own catchwords, we are 
slaughtered by our own slogans. 



70 



GALAXY 



There are boomerangs whizzing 
about our ears from every angle. 
None of it goes over the way it is 
supposed to. It all twists wrong for 
us.” 

“Well, what is causing this? Why 
are our effects being nullified?” 
“Sir, I believe that somebody 
else is also busy creating images 
and attitudes. Our catechesis states 
that this is impossible since we are 
the only group permitted in the 
field. Nevertheless, I am sure that 
someone else is building these 
things against us. It even seems 
that they are more powerful than 
we are — and they are unknown.” 
“They cannot be more powerful 
than we are — and they must not 
remain unknown to us.” Mr. Dan- 
di’s words stabbed. “Find out who 
they are, John.” 

“How?” 

“If I knew how, John, I would 
be working for you, not you work- 
ing for me. Your job is to do 
things. Mine is the much more dif- 
ficult one of telling you to do 
them. Find out, John.” 

J OHN CANDOR went to work 
on the problem. He considered 
whether it was a linear, a set or a 
group problem. If it were a linear 
problem he should have been able 
to solve it by himself — and he 
couldn’t. If it were a set problem', 
then it couldn’t be solved at all. Of 
necessity he classified it as a group 
problem and he assembled a group 
to solve it. This was easy at 



ABNC which had more group tal- 
ent than anybody. 

The group that John Candor as- 
sembled was made up of August 
Crayfish, Sterling Groshawk, 
Maurice Cree, Nancy Peters, 
Tony Rover, Morgan Aye, and 
Betty McCraken. Tell the truth, 
would you be able to gather so tal- 
ented a group in your own organi- 
zation? 

“My good people,” John Can- 
dor said, “as we all know, some- 
thing has gone very wrong with our 
effects. It must be righted. 
Thoughts, please, thoughts!” 

“We inflate a person or subject 
and he bursts on us,” August gave 
his thought. “Are we using the 
wrong gas?” 

“We launch a phrase and it 
turns into a joke,” Sterling com- 
plained. “Yet we have not slighted 
the check-off; it has always been 
examined from every angle to be 
sure that it doesn’t have a joker 
context. But something goes 
wrong.” 

“We build an attitude carefully 
from the ground up,” Maurice 
stated. “Then our firm ground 
turns boggy and the thing tilts and 
begins to sink.” 

“Our ‘Fruitful Misunderstand- 
ings,’ the most subtle and effective 
of our current devices, are begin- 
ning to bear sour fruit,” Nancy 
said. 

“We set ourselves to cut a man 
down and our daggers turn to rub- 
ber,” Tony Rover moaned. (Oh, 



ABOUT A SECRET CROCODILE 



71 




were there ever sadder words? ‘Our 
daggers have turned to rubber.) 

“Things have become so shaky 
that we’re not sure whether we are 
talking about free or closed vari- 
ables,” Morgan gave his thought. 

“How can my own loving moth- 
er make such atrocious sand- 
wiches?’’ Betty McCracken 
munched distastefully. Betty, who 
was underpaid, was a brown-sack 
girl who brought her own lunch. 
“This is worse than usual.” She 
chewed on. “The only thing to do 
with it is feed it to the computer.” 
She fed it to the computer which 
ate it with evident pleasure. 

“Seven persons, seven 
thoughts,” John Candor mused. 

“Seven persons, si,\ thoughts,” 
Nancy Peters spat bitterly. “Betty, 
as usual, has contributed nothing.” 
“Only the first stage of the ans- 
wer,” John Candor said. “She said 
‘The only thing to do with it is to 
feed it to the computer.’ Feed the 
problem to the computer, folks.” 
They fed the problem to the 
computer by pieces and by wholes. 
The machine was familiar with 
their lingos and procedures. It was 
acquainted with the Non-Valid 
Context Problems of Morgan Aye 
and with the Hollow Shell I’erson 
Puzzles of Tony Rover. It knew 
the Pervading Fnvironment Ploy of 
Maurice Cree. It knew what trick- 
work to operate within. 

Again and again the machine 
asked for various kinds of supple- 
mentary exterior data. 



“Leave me with it,” the machine 
finally issued. “Assemble here 
again in sixty days, or hours — ” 
“No, we want the answers right 
now,” John Candor insisted, 
“within sixty seconds.” 

“The second is possibly the in- 
terval 1 was thinking of,” the ma- 
chine issued. “What’s time to a 
tin can anyhow?” It ground its da- 
ta trains for a full minute. 

“Well?” John Candor asked. 
“Somehow I get the number 
three,” the machine issued. 

“Three what, machine?” 

“Three persons,” the machine 
issued. “They are unknowingly 
linked together to manufacture at- 
titudes. They are without program 
or purpose or organization or re- 
muneration or basic or malice.” 
“Nobody is without malice,” 
August Crayfish insisted in a 
startled way. “They must be total- 
ly alien forms then. How do they 
manage their effects?” 

“One with a gesture, one with a 
grimace, one with an intonation,” 
the machine issued. 

“Where are they?” John Candor 
demanded. 

“All comparatively near.” The 
machine drew three circles on the 
city map. “Lach is to be found in 
his ow n circle most of the time.” 
“Their names?” John Candor 
asked and the machine wrote the 
name of each in the proper circle. 

“Do you have anything on their 
appearances?” Sterling Groshawk 
inquired and the machine manu- 



72 



GALAXY 




factured three kymograph pictures 
of the targets. 

“Have you their addresses or 
identifying numbers?” Maurice 
Cree asked. 

“No. I think it’s remarkable of 
me that 1 was able to come up with 
this much,” the machine issued. 

“We can find them,” Betty Mc- 
Cracken said. “We can most likely 
find them in the phone book.” 

“What worries me is that there’s 
no malice in them,” John Can- 
dor worried. “Without malice, 
there’s no handle to get hold of a 
thing. The Disestablishment has 
been firmly established for these 
several hundred years and we hold 
it to be privileged. It must not be 
upset by these three randoms. We 
will do what we must do.” 



IKE ZHESTOVITCH was a 
mighty man. One does not 
make the primordial gestures out 
of weak body and hands. He 
looked like a steel worker — or 
anyhow like a worker at one of 
the powerful trades. His torso was 
like a barrel but more noble than 
ordinary barrels. His arms and 
hands were hardly to be believed. 
His neck was for the bulls, his 
head was as big as a thirteen gallon 
firkin, his eyeballs were the size of 
ducks’ eggs and the hair on his 
chest and throat was that heavy 
black wire-grass that defies steel 
plowshares. His voice — well he 
didn’t have much of a voice — it 



wasn’t as mighty as the rest of 
him. 

And he didn’t really work at one 
of the powerful trades. He was a 
zipper repairman at the Jiffy Nif- 
ty Dry Cleaners. 

August Crayfish of ABNC lo- 
cated Mike Zhestovitch in the 
Blind Bobbin Bar which (if you re- 
call the way that block lies) is just 
across that short jog-alley from 
the Jiffy Nifty. And August rec- 
ognized big Mike at once. But 
how did big Mike get his effects? 

“The Cardinals should take the 
Colts today,” a serious man there 
was saying. 

“The Cardinals -” Mike Zhes- 
tovitch began in the voice that was 
less noble than the rest of him, but 
he didn’t finish the sentence. As a 
matter of fact, big Mike had nev- 
er finished a sentence in all his life. 
Instead he made the gesture with 
his mighty hands and body. Words 
cannot describe the gesture but it 
was something like balling up an 
idea or opinion in the giant hands 
and throwing it away, utterly 
away, over the very edge of con- 
tempt. 

The Cardinals, of course, did 
not take the Colts that day. For a 
moment it was doubtful whether 
the Cardinals would survive at all. 
From the corner of the eye, red 
feathers could be seen drifting 
away in the air. 

August Crayfish carefully 
waited a moment and watched. A 
man walked out of the Blind Rob- 




ABOUT A SECRET CROCODILE 



73 




bin and talked to another man in 
that little jog-alley. From their 
seriousness it was certain that they 
were talking baseball. 

“The Cardinals — ” the first 
man said after a moment, and he 
also made the gesture. And sec- 
onds later a man playing eight-ball 
in Ihe back of the Blind Bobbin 
did the same thing. 

August was sure then. Mike 
Zhestovitch not only could shrivel 
anything with the gesture, but the 
gesture as he used it was highly 
epidemic. It would spread, accord- 
ing to Schoeffler’s Law of Dis- 
persal, through the city in short 
minutes, through the world in 
short hours. And no opinion could 
stand against its disfavor. Mike 
Zhestovitch could wreck images 
and attitudes — and possibly he 
could also create them. 

“Do you work alone?” August 
Crayfish asked. 

“No. The rip-fix and the button- 
sew girls work in the same cubby- 
hole,” Mike said with his curious- 
ly small voice. 

“Do you know a Mary Smor- 
fia?” August asked. 

“I don’t, no,” Mike said, a cer- 
tain comprehension coming into 
his ducks’-egg-sized eyes. “And 
you are glad that I don’t? Then 1 
will. I’ll find out who she is. I see 
it now that you are a wrong guy 
and she is a right girl.” 

Then August Crayfish spoke 
the slogan that would be unveiled 
to the ears of the world that very 



night, a wonderfully slippery slo- 
gan that had cost a hundred thou- 
sand dollars to construct. It should 
have warned Mike Zhestovitch 
away from his mad resistance. 

Mike Zhestovitch made the ges- 
ture, and the slogan was in ruins. 
And somewhere the Secret Croco- 
dile lashed its tail in displeasure. 

“Do you want to make a lot of 
money?” August Crayfish whis- 
pered after a long reevaluation 
pause. 

“Money — from such as you — ” 
Big Mike didn’t finish the sentence, 
he never did. But he made the ges- 
ture. The idea of a lot of money 
shriveled. And August Crayfish 
shriveled so small that he could not 
climb over the threshold of the 
Blind Bobbin on the way out and 
had to be aided over it by the shod 
— toe of a kind man. (This last 
statement is a literal exaggeration 
but it is the right direction.) 

ANCY PETEBS of ABNC lo- 
cated Mary Smorfia in the 
King-Pin Bowling Alley, where 
she was a hamburger waitress and 
a beer buster. Mary was small, 
dark, unpretty (except for her 
high-frequency eyes and the beau- 
tiful gash across her face that was 
her mouth), lively, smart, busy, a 
member of that aberrant variety 
of the human race that was called 
Italian. 

“Snorting Summer should take 
the Academy Award,” one nice 
guzzling lady at the counter was 




74 



GALAXY 




saying to another, “and Clover 
Elysee is the shoeless shoo-in for 
best actress of the year.” 

And Mary Smorfia made the 
grimace. Ah, it was mostly done 
with the beautifully large mouth 
and yet every part of her entered 
into it, from the blue lights in her 
hair to her crinkly toes. It was a 
devastating, all-destroying gri- 
mace. It gobbled up, it nullified 
and it made itself felt to a great 
distance. The nice guzzling lady 
had not even been looking toward 
Mary Smorfia but she felt the 
grimace like a soul shock, and she 
herself did the grimace with a won- 
derful distortion of the features 
that weren’t made for it. 

And the grimace swept every- 
thing like quick contagion or 
prairie fire. Snorting Summer — 
gah! Clover Elysee — guggling gah! 
Those things were finished for- 
ever, beyond laughter, below de- 
rision. And Nancy Peters of 
ABNC noted the powerful effect 
carefully, for the original words 
of the nice guzzling lady were the 
very words that ABNC had se- 
lected to be echoed a hundred mil- 
lion times whenever the awards 
were thought of. 

“Do you work alone?” Nancy 
Peters asked Mary Smorfia. 

“Kid, I am so fast they don’t 
need anyone else on this shift. I’m 
like silly lightning.” 

“Did you ever think of becom- 
ing an actress, Mary?” Nancy as- 
ked in honey-tones. 



“Oh, I made a commercial 
once,” Mary said out of her curly 
gash-mouth (she had to be kidding; 
she couldn’t really have a mouth 
that looked like that). “I don’t 
know whether 1 sold much of my 
guy’s soap but I bet I got a lot of 
people off that Brand X. Ashes it 
was, worse even, after I monkey- 
faced it. They say I’m a natural — 
but once is enough.” 

“Do you know a Mike Zhesto- 
vitch or a Clivendon Surrey?” 
Nancy asked. 

“1 don’t think so,” Mary said. 
“What league do they bowl in? I 
bet I will like them both, though, 
and I will remember their names 
and find them.” 

Nancy Peters was nervous. She 
felt that the annihilating grimace 
was about to strike again on 
Mary’s lightning-gash mouth. But 
it was time for the test of strength. 
Nancy spoke the new slogan that 
had been selected for presentation 
to the world that very night, a 
wonderfully convincing and power- 
ful slogan that should bring this 
random Mary Smorfia to heel if 
anything could. And she spoke it 
with all the absolute expertise of 
the Crocodile’s Mouth behind her. 

The Grimace! And the slogan 
was destroyed forever. And (gri- 
macing horror turned inward) 
Nancy caught the contagion and 
was doing the grimace herself. She 
was quite unable to get the thing 
off her face. 

Sheer humiliation overwhelmed

the Nancy person, who had sud- 
denly been made small. And some- 
where the Secret Crocodile lashed 
its tail in displeasure and unease. 

“Do you want to make twenty 
thousand dollars, Mary?” Nancy 
asked after she had returned from 
the jane where she had daubed her 
flushed face and cooled her flus- 
tered body. 

“Twenty thousand dollars isn’t 
very much,’’ Mary Smorfia 
sounded • out of her panoramic 
mouth. “1 make eighty-eight fifty 
now after everything. I could make 
a lot more if I wanted to go along 
with the cruds.” 

“Twenty thousand dollars is 
very much more,” Nancy Peters 
said enticingly. 

“It is very much more cruddy, 
kid.” Mary Smorfia grimaced. 
Grimaced! Not again! Nancy Pet- 
ers fled in deflated panic. She felt 
herself dishonored forever. 

Well, do you think it is all wa- 
ter-melon pickles and pepper rel- 
ish, this unilaterally creating all 
the images and attitudes for the 
whole world? It isn’t. It is a de- 
tailed and devious thing and the 
privileged Disestablishment had 
been building it for centuries. (The 
Establishment itself had been no 
more than a figure of speech for 
most of those centuries, a few 
clinging bits of bark; the heart of 
the tree had long been possessed 
by the privileged Disestablish- 
ment.) Three quick random per- 
sons could not be permitted to nul- 



lify words from the Mouth itself. 

M organ aye of abnc lo- 
cated Clivendon Surrey in 
Speedsters’ Cafe. Clivendon was a 
lank and fair-haired man with a 
sort of weariness about him, a' 
worldliness that had to be genera- 
tions old. He had the superior 
brow and the thoroughbred nose 
that isn’t grown in short centur- 
ies. He had the voice, the intona- 
tion, the touch of Groton, the 
touch of Balliol, the strong touch 
of other institutions even more 
august. It was a marvelous voice, 
at least the intonation of it. Cliv- 
endon’s employer once said that 
he didn’t believe that Clivendon 
ever spoke in words, at least not in 
any words that he was ever able to 
understand. The intonation was 
really a snort, a sort of neigh, but 
it carried the cresting contempt of 
the ages in its tone. And it was 
contagious. 

Clivendon was really of Swed- 
ish extraction and had come off a 
farm near Pottersville. He had de- 
veloped that intonation for a role 
in a high-school play. He had liked 
it and he had kept it. Clivendon 
was a motorcycle mechanic at 
Downhillers’ Garage. 

“Do you work alone?” Morgan 
Aye asked Clivendon. 

“Naeu. You work alone and 
you got to work. You work with 
a bunch and you can slip out from 
it,” Clivendon intoned. Yes, he 
talked in words and the words

could be mostly understood. But 
the towering intonation was the 
thing, the world-wilting contempt 
of the tone. This man was a natu- 
ral and Morgan felt himself a foot 
shorter in the very presence of that 
tone. 

“Do you know a Mike Zhesto- 
vitch or a Mary Smorfia?” Mor- 
gan asked fearfully. 

“That’s a funny thing.” The 
tone cut through car-wax and the 
soft spots of the spleen. “I had 
never heard of them but Mary 
Smorfia called me up not thirty 
minutes ago and said that she 
wanted both of us to meet Mike. 
So I’ll meet them in about twenty 
minutes, as soon as the clock there 
says that I’m supposed to be off 
work at Downhillers’ Garage.” 

“Don’t meet them!” Morgan 
eried out violently. “That might be 
the closing of the link, the setting 
up of a league. It might be an af- 
front to the Mouth itself.” 

The tone, the neigh, the snort, 
the sharp edge of a wordless int 04 i- 
ation sent Morgan reeling back. 
And there were echoes of it 
throughout Speedsters’ Cafe and 
in the streets outside. The tone 
was as contagious as it was cut- 
ting. 

Morgan started to speak the 
newest selected slogan from the 
Mouth — and he stopped short. He 
was afraid of the test of strength. 
Two very expensive slogans had al- 
ready been shattered today by 
these randoms. ‘No malice in the 



three,’ the computer had said and: 
‘without malice, there’s no handle 
to get hold of a thing,’ John Can- 
dor had stated. But somewhere in 
that mountainous and contagious 
contempt of tone that belonged to 
Clivendon Surrey had to be some 
malice. So Morgan Aye reached 
for what had always been the ulti- 
mate weapon of the Crocodile’s 
Mouth. It always worked- it al- 
ways worked if any malice at all 
existed in the object. 

“How would you like to make 
five thousand dollars a week?” he 
whispered to Clivendon. 

“What garage pays that much?” 
Clivendon asked in honest wonder. 
“I’m- not that good a motorcycle 
mechanic.” 

“Five thousand dollars a week 
to work with us at ABNC,” Mor- 
gan tempted. “We could use you 
in so many ways that marvelous 
scorn to cut down any man we 
wished! You could lend the intona- 
tions of your voice' to our 

The neigh was like a thousand 
sea stallions breaking up from the 
depths. The snort was one that 
crumbles cliffs at the ends of the 
earth. Morgan Aye had gone 
ghastly white and his ears were 
bleeding from the transgression of 
that cutting sound. There were 
even some words in Clivendon’s 
sounding -“Why, then I’d be one 
of the birds that picks the shreds of 
flesh from between the teeth of the 
monster.” Blinding hooting con- 
tempt in the tone and Morgan .Aye

was in the street and running from 
it. 

But the echoes of that intonation 
were everywhere in that part of 
town, soon to be all over the town, 
all over the world. It was an epi- 
demic of snorting at the Croco- 
dile’s Mouth itself. Fools! Did 
they know that this was but one 
step from snorting at the very 
Crocodile? 

T he ring had closed. The infor- 
mal league had formed now. 
The three randoms had met and 
united. The Mouth was affronted. 
Worse than that, all the outpour 
of the Mouth was nullified. The 
whole world was rejecting the 
catchwords that came from the 
Mouth, was laughing at them, was 
throwing them away with the ut- 
termost gesture, was monkey-fac- 
ing them, was snorting them down, 
was casting them out with bottom- 
less contempt. 

This was the short reign of the 
secret society of three, who did 
not know that they were secret. 
But in their day they closed the 
Mouth down completely. It was 
filled with mud and swamp reeds 
and rotting flesh. 

The Secret Crocodile was lash- 
ing its tail with acute displeasure 
now. The Crocodile’s Mouth had 
become quite nervous. And what 
of the little birds that fly in and 
out of that mouth, that preen the 
teeth and glean scraps of flesh 
and slogans and catchwords there? 



The birds were in quite an un- 
happy flutter. 

“There is open conspiracy 
against us by a secret society of 
three persons,” Mr. James Dandi 
was saying, “and alt the world 
abominates a secret society. We 
have this thing to do this day — to 
cripple it forever in its strength. 
Otherwise we will be cast out and 
broken as ineffectual instruments 
and the Crocodile will bring in 
strong persons from the Cocked 
Eye or the Cryptic Cootie to take 
our places. Surely we are not with- 
out resources. What is the logical 
follow-up to the Fruitful Misun- 
derstanding?” 

“The Purposive Accident,” John 
Candor said immediately. 

“Take care of it, John,” Mr. 
James Dandi said. “Remember, 
though, that he whose teeth we 
preen is the very bowels of com- 
passion. I believe this is the salient 
thing in the world in our day. the 
Compassion of the Crocodile.” 

“Take care of it, people,” John 
Candor said to his seven talented 
ones, “remembering always that 
the Crocodile is the very belly of 
compassion.” 

“Take care of it,” the seven 
said to the computer, “always 
within the context of the jaws of 
compassion.” 

The computer programed a 
Purposive Accident to happen and 
manufactured such props as were 
needed. And the Purposive Acci- 
dent was very well programmed.

There was no great amount of 
blood poured out. No persons were 
killed except several uninvolved 
bystanders. The secret three were 
left alive and ambulant and scathed 
only at their points of strength. 

It happened in the block be- 
tween the Blind Bobbin Bar and 
Speedsters’ Cafe when all three 
members of the secret society hap- 
pened to be walking together. The 
papers called it a bomb; they call 
everything a bomb that goes off 
like that. It was really a highly 
sophisticated homing device with a 
tripartite programing and it car- 
ried out its tripartite mission. 

All three randoms, former 
members of the short-lived secret 
society, are well and working 
again. Mike Zhestovitch is no 
longer a zipper repair man (it 
takes two talented hands to fix 
those zippers), but he still works 
at the Jiffy Nifty Dry Cleaners. 
He runs one of those big pressers 
now which he can easily do with 
his powerful and undamaged left 
hand and his prosthetic right hand. 
But without his old right hand he 
can no longer make the contagious 
primordial gesture that once 
dumbfounded the Mouth and all 
its words. You just cannot make 
the big gesture with a false hand. 

Mary Smorfia still works at the 
King-Pin Bowling Alley as ham- 
burger waitress and beer buster. 
She is still small, dark, unpretty 
(except for her high-frequency 
eyes), lively, smart, and Italian. 



Her mouth is still a gash across 
her face, but now it is twice as 
great a gash as it used to be, and 
it no longer has its curled liveli- 
ness. Its mobility is all gone, it 
will no longer express the inex- 
pressible, will no longer shatter a 
phrase or an attitude. Mary Smor- 
fia is as she always was, except 
that now she is incapable of the 
famous grimace. 

Clivendon Surrey is again a mo- 
torcycle mechanic at Downhiller’s 
Garage and again he spends most 
of his time in Speedsters’ Cafe. 
His vocal cords are gone, of 
course, but he gets by: he is able 
to speak with a throat microphone. 
But the famous intonation, the 
neigh, the destroying snort are all 
impossible for him. 

The trouble is over with. Now 
again there is only one organiza- 
tion in the world to create the 
images and attitudes of the world. 
This insures that only the stand- 
ard attitudes of the Disestablish- 
ment shall prevail. 

I N OUR opening catalog we for- 
got one group. There is another 
secret society in the world com- 
posed of the good guys and good 
gals. It has no name that we have 
ever heard except just the Good 
Guys and Good Gals. At the mo- 
ment this society controls nothing 
at all in the world. It stirs a little, 
though. It may move. It may col- 
lide, someday, even with the Secret 
Crocodile itself. ★

T|R. WANG turned his Oriental 
"eyes from the violent colors of 
the parasol. 

“It’s clean, all right, I even 
tested for sugar.” 

He smiled a quiet smile at his 
quiet joke. 

“Then we’re all in agreement 
that it’s a plain, rather ordinary 
umbrella,” said the chairman, 
“aside from its somewhat unique 
coloring.” 

“Within the observational limi- 
tations of our tests,” amended Dr. 
Werthmann. 

“Can the applesauce,” said Dr. 
Longstead. “It’s a common bum- 
bershoot. Period.” 

The old physicist jammed his 
ragged cigar back into his mouth 
and slapped the table top with a 
wrinkled hand. 

A light knock came at the door 
and the chairman rose from the 
long hardwood table. At his invi- 
tation a modishly attired, middle- 
aged woman entered the room and 
seated herself at the head of the 
table. 

Introductions were offered. 
Mrs. Smith smiled at the chair- 
man and the Doctors Wang, 
Werthman, Longstead, Carpenter, 
and Brown. 

After a minimal exchange of 
small talk Mrs. Smith answered 
several pertinent questions. She 
explained that she had always had 
a parlor interest in extrasensory 
phenomena and that she had nev- 
er really noted any psychic abili- 



ties of her own prior to her expe- 
riences with the psychedelic para- 
sol. The parasol had been bought 
from a Greenwich Village stand. 
It had been a very sunny day and 
she had nearly fainted during a 
mass protest rally at Washington 
Sqbare. No, she couldn’t remem- 
ber what the protest was against 
but the event had occurred about 
two months ago and the parasol 
had probably saved her from sun- 
stroke. And, yes, she could con- 
trol the parasol’s movements with 
the power of her mind. She had, 
in fact, done so on at least a hun- 
dred separate occasions. 

Following a careful search of 
Mrs. Smith’s person, which she 
seemed more than willing to en- 
dure, the gathering turned its at- 
tention to the center of the table. 

The bottom of the open parasol 
was loosely fitted into a clear glass 
bottle. The bottle had been per- 
sonally selected by Dr. Wang 
from his own laboratory. 

“It’s all a question of my will,” 
said Mrs. Smith. “When I focus 
my total attention on it and insist 
that it should spin, it spins.” She 
closed her eyes, resting them for 
a moment. “Lately I’ve felt an 
ever growing rapport with it.” 

When she was ready for the 
demonstration she asked the ob- 
servers for complete quiet and sat 
bolt upright upon her chair. 

She began to stare at the para- 
sol. 

After a minute or two perspi- 



82 




ration began to trickle from her 
forehead. Some of the sweat rolled 
to the edges of her eyes but her 
stare indicated obliviousness to 
any discomfort. 

Suddenly, with an eerie squeak 
I'rom the bottle’s lip, the parasol 
began to spin its bizarre sunshade. 

There were tiny momentary 
sounds from the observers but the 
squeak from the bottle was the 
loudest sound within the room. 

For several minutes the spell- 
bound men watched the slowly 
twirling parasol. 

The parasol stopped spinning 



and the scientists turned their eyes 
to Mrs. Smith. 

Still staring at the parasol, she 
moved her lips in a slight whisper. 

“My God — ’’ she murmured. 

Slowly rising to her feet, her 
eyes an unblinking glare of an- 
guish, she kicked backward with a 
stiff leg, shoving the chair away 
from her back. 

With a mechanical movement 
she stretched out her arms like 
one being crucified. 

Her high-heeled shoes made an 
eerie squeaking sound as she start- 
ed to spin. if

TIME GREAT BELDINI, feeling 
* not so great, and aware of a 
l.ister than usual thumping in his 
rlicst, stared into the mirror and 
liilhered the part of his face not 
covered with sideburns, beard, and 
mustache. The burns were of medi- 
um length, the beard vaguely Van- 
(lykian, and the mustache late 
WWII RAF. Not exactly a har- 
monious combination, but it 
pleased Beldini. 

Beldini, in his lathering, used a 
brush and a cake of shaving soap; 
he’d discovered he could get more 
'.haves per dime that way. 

Finished, he reached into the 
space before the mirror, material- 
ized a fifty-cent piece between 
thumb and forefinger, multiplied 
that one by four, vanished three of 
the coins, pocketed the last one. It 
was important to remain in form, 
though these days he worked most- 
ly at children’s birthday parties. It 
was particularly needful to hone 
the nerve endings on days which 
were not like other days. 

So, he said half aloud, this day 
begins, at any rate, like any oth- 
er. 

. .as last night had ended like 
many other nights. Gloria. Gloria 
had left while Beldini still slept, as 
usually happened when she stayed 
over. Beldini hadn’t really been 
sleeping when Gloria left, he’d 
been lying there dozing, snuggling 
the warm sheets, reaching out for 
the girl not thei^ glad he didn’t 
have to be up yet. 



Gloria was small and her hair 
was as black and as long as could 
be and when she was nice she was 
very very nice, but when she 
thought about Beldini’s earned in- 
come she tended to be--disputa- 
tious, to put it kindly. She didn’t 
want to be that way and she hated 
herself the next morning, some- 
times, fixing her hair, going off in- 
to the city to read manuscripts (at 
a very good salary, because she 
was very good at it), thinking 
about what she’d said the night be- 
fore. 

Gloria was disputatious when 
she thought about Beldini’s bank 
account, not because she wanted 
to leave her job when they married 
— she wanted to keep on working 
— but because she had conceived 
the idea that she shouldn’t marry 
Beldini until he was making at 
least two-thirds as much as she 
was. Parity, she thought, would be 
asking too much. 

“It was different in the days of 
Houdini,’’ Beldini had said the 
night before. “Magicians — not on- 
ly Houdini but other good ones — 
filled theaters, appeared in big 
shows. Jumbo — ’’ 

“I know,” Gloria said. She 
wanted to be kind, yes, but she had 
her standards. “But there are other 
things you could do except play for 
children’s parties. You’ve got a 
perfectly good M.S. in geology. 
You could — ” 

Beldini’s look cut her off. “But 
this is what I want to do,” he said.

He produced a Panamanian flag, 
then a yellow rose, from the un- 
concealed place between her 
breasts. 

A seven-year-old kid I've got to 
love, Gloria thought. “How did — ” 

But she didn’t really want to 
know and neither of them took it 
from there. After a while she 
wasn’t disputatious and later she 
asked drowsily, “Joe?” He was 
Giuseppe, but she called him Joe 
except when she was really mad — 
then it was Beldini-The-So-Called- 
Great. 

“Urn?” 

“What really happened to Wan- 
da?” His first wife. 

“An improperly trained assist- 
ant,” Beldini mumbled. “My fault, 
actually.” 

“What?” 

“I’m sleepy. Sawing a woman in 
half.” 

“What?” 

“She did.” 

“Did what?” 

“Sawed Wanda in half. Improp- 
erly trained. .” 

“You say the damndest things,” 
Gloria said. 

T he moon rock, in its longest 
dimension, measured no more 
than an inch and a half. It was 
quite black, with glassy flecks. Ex- 
cept for the angularity of the edges 
it looked much like a terrestrial 
stone from Egypt Beach or Mar- 
blehead or any of a hundred or a 
thousand places where rocks be- 



yond counting had been thrust, 
upon sandy places by rising and 
ebbing tides, by monotonously 
shuffling waves. 

The grand auditorium in which 
the rock was displayed teemed with 
a. busy humanity, much of it bent 
on closing exhibits and getting out 
of there after five days of dull but : 
demanding work. You ever try to 
demonstrate a three-thousand-dol- 
lar desk-top calculator to a mousy, 
dandruff-haired, inquiring girl who 
is attracted by the pretty lights and 
the digital readout but doesn’t ' 
know a square root from a turnip? , 
Tired people, packing their gear, I 
wanting out. ; 

Whatever Beldini was he was not i 
tired, though one might wonder | 
why not. He had spent many hours ; 
of the four preceding days here — | 
as inconspicuously as possible, if 1 
that needs saying. He had gotten a 
long and good look at the moon 
rock the first day and had seen on 
that and other days how they put ' 
the rock away at night. Now — sur- 
rounded by what approached the 
clatter of a country carnival strik- 
ing the show before moving on — he 
felt his own stone in his jacket 
pocket. An adequate ringer, he 
thought. Not brilliantly convincing 
but under the circumstances (he 
thought) adequate. 

The exhibits were supposed to be 
open until five but everybody was 
fudging. Fatigue and the feeling of 
something finished was in the air 
and Beldini, absently smoothing a 



86 



GALAXY 



frayed collar, tuned into that scene 
with the acuity of a bat flying 
through an electric fan. He wished 
Gloria were watching. 

The rock rested upon a small, 
rotating, velvet-covered dais, sur- 
rounded by a bolted-down trans- 
parent cylinder, which Beldini as- 
sumed to be constructed of bullet- 
proof glass. There was lots of il- 
lumination from spotlights and 
thousands of shutterbugs had pho- 
tographed the dark object. A lens 
had been placed within the protec- 
tive cylinder and people tended to 
gravitate toward that side, gazing 
silently until edged off by those 
who had not yet had a look. An 
armed guard, nattily uniformed in 
forest green, was never more than 
eight feet from the exhibit. The one 
now on duty was a slender young 
man, who often ran his right index 
finger over a neatly trimmed black 
mustache. He was, Beldini noted, a 
picture of perfect boredom. 

Beldini Skulked around an ex- 
hibit of technical books, keeping 
his eyes on one of the two main en- 
trances into the auditorium. When 
he saw what he was looking for he 
briskly approached the moon rock. 
He had the lens to himself, stared 
through it intently. 

“Sorry, mister,” the guard said, 
“but we’re closing this exhibit.” 
The guard was less bored now. Bel- 
dini backed off slightly. 

“But it isn’t five — ” 

“We’re closing,” the guard said. 

The NASA representative, for 



whom Beldini had been watching a 
few minutes earlier, was an old- 
fashioned young middle-aged pro- 
fessorial type. Pipe, baggy gray 
flannels, offensive jacket — you 
know. He yawned as he put down 
the black leather bag he carried. 
He opened the bag and withdrew — 
as if it were an object he was about 
to discard into the trash — a box 
made of thick plywood. It was 
painted blue and measured about 
eight inches on each side. The 
NASA man twisted a key in a 
small lock and raised the hinged 
lid. Within the box was a styro- 
foam cradle, of which the profes- 
sor removed the top half. Within 
the hollowed space of the cradle 
was a quantity of quarter-inch 
foam rubber. NASA removed 
from his bag a small socket 
wrench. 

“Stand back,” the no-longer- 
bored guard said to a group of 
three eight- or nine-year-olds clos- 
ing in. His hand was on the grip of 
his bolstered forty-five. He had 
them outgunned, and knew it. One 
could see the dusty street in which 
he stood — at high noon, no doubt, 
feet apart, coolly facing the ap- 
proach of the fastest draw this side 
of the Pecos. 

NASA unscrewed the three re- 
straining nuts, lifted aside the shel- 
tering cylinder (it wasn’t really bul- 
let-proof, just a new polycarbonate 
you couldn’t throw rocks through), 
and placed it on the floor. He ca- 
sually lifted the moon rock from

its dais and Beldini went into ac- 
tion, gently insinuating himself be- 
tween the rock and the box. 

Watch this, Gloria. 

“Sir,” he said, “if I could just — 
touch it a moment?” 

NASA made as if to bypass, but 
Beldini was not a magician for 
nothing. He had at his disposal a 
rich armamentarium of patter. The 
line he followed now ended with: 
“ — and I’ve been a rock hound, an 
amateur geologist, that is, all my 
life.” An obscure impulse told him 
not to mention the M.S. “If 1 
could just — hold it a second?” His 
dark eyes beseeched, his lips quiv- 
ered. 

NASA cast his glance aloft, 
sighed and let the magician hold 
the stone for about a second, which 
was quite enough. 

“Oh. Thank you, sir,” said Bel- 
dini, handing'NASA the ringer. 
“I’ll never forget this moment.” 

NASA swaddled the stone (Bel- 
dini had found it, some years back, 
in the Ruggles mine in northern 
New Hampshire) in foam rubber, 
placed it in the bottom half of the 
cradle, replaced the upper half. He 
swung down the lid and turned the 
key in the little lock. Into the 
black leather bag. NASA left the 
auditorium, accompanied by the 
guard who, you could tell, was 
now patrolling the Main Street 
sidewalk of Dodge City. 

Beldini took a last look at the 
exhibit, at the spot where the moon 
rock had rested. / have, he thought. 



a baked potato in my pocket. A 
hot one at that and surely everyone 
in the auditorium can smell it. 

He got out of there. 

Wait until I show Gloria. 

B eldini — the only private citi- 
zen in the world to own, if that 
isn’t too loose a use of the word, a 
moon rock — took the pedestrian 
MBTA to Harvard Square. He 
was eager to see Gloria but she 
wouldn’t be home yet, and on the 
way he stopped in a friendly neigh- 
borhood tavern. He wasn’t a drink- 
ing man but he wanted a martini. 

He sat on a stool at the bar, 
stared intently at the cocktail, 
while extracting a five-dollar bill 
from the bartender’s ear. Carl 
gfinned, making change. Beldini 
had been there before. 

“Things been good?” Carl 
asked. 

“Yes. I worked today.” 

“Good.” Carl was busy with the 
usual lot of student's, faculty, 
hangers on, unclassifiables. 

“Good show,” Beldini said ab- 
sently not much later, finishing his 
drink. 

Carl, passing by, heard the re- 
mark. “What?” 

“Just talking to myself.” 

Carl shrugged. Beldini set down 
his empty glass, made it to the 
murky outside and slurped his way 
through the slush toward his apart- 
ment, which was on Ware Street. 
He was accompanied by an unin- 
vited vague awareness of unease.

which impinged unpleasantly upon 
his anticipatory pleasure in show- 
ing Gloria the stone. Suddenly he 
wished he had been commissioned 
by a multimillionaire rock hound, 
who would shower him with pearls 
and rubies and keep the deal quiet. 

I should, maybe, advertise in the 
Lapidary Journal. 

The great magician, now snug in 
his unprepossessing but welcoming 
apartment, took the rock from his 
pocket, unwrapped it carefully 
from the clean handkerchief. He 
looked at it, eyes sparkling, and 
thought of Gloria. Anxiety de- 
parted. 

There were several large black 
trunks in his bedroom, all of them 
plastered with tired and frayed la- 
bels and stickers, testaments of 
great appearances and one-night 
stands from here to there. Beldini 
opened one of these trunks and re- 
moved from its tangled contents a 
small collapsible stand, which he 
set up in the center of the living 
room. (Living room, bedroom, 
kitchenette and bath were all he 
had but just now Beldini might as 
well have been on the stage of, say, 
the Palace. Or the Hippodrome. A 
long time ago, yes.) 

He covered the small stand with 
a square of black velvet, then cov- 
ered that with a flamboyant ex- 
panse of purple and yellow silk. He 
returned the moon rock to his 
pocket. 

He glanced at his watch and (in- 
expertly) mixed a pitcher of mar- 



tinis. Buzzing of buzzer. Beldini 
greeted Gloria at the door with a 
great deal of onstage courtly 
pomp, took her coat with a lot of 
circumstance and placed her on the 
sofa before the covered stand. 
Wheels were spinning within Glo- 
ria’s black-thatched lovely head — 
but she remained silent. 

“A martini for Miss Gloria?” 
he asked. 

“Of course, Mr. Beldini. But of 
course.” 

She took a cigarette from an in- 
tricately carved box on the table. 
Beldini produced — a matter of 
course — a lighted match from his 
pocket. Gloria knew Beldini pretty 
well but he still surprised her now 
and then. 

“A mere trifle,” he said, disap- 
pearing into the kitchen. He re- 
turned in a moment with the pitch- 
er and two glasses. He filled the 
glasses. With, need we say, cere- 
mony. As well as martinis, of 
course. 

“Giuseppe,” she said. Giuseppe 
was about half way between Joe 
and The-Not-So-Great-Beldini. 
“Just what the hell are you up to?” 

“At the moment I’m up to 
drinking a martini. To drinking to 
us — to the most beguiling jewel of 
the publishing world (he gave her a 
stately bow) and, with all modesty 
(here he attempted an expression 
of humility but it didn’t come off 
by orders of magnitude), to the 
last of the great magicians — ” 

Gloria gave him a look, they

clinked glasses and drank. She 
gave him another look. “I didn’t 
say I made the best martinis in the 
world,” he said. “However — ” 

He placed himself behind the 
stand, went into an elaborate line 
of patter, showed several times 
that the stand was incontestably 
unoccupied and finally whisked 
away the purple and yellow silk. 
To reveal the moon rock. 

Talk about anticlimax. 

“Yes,” Beldini said, noting Glo- 
ria’s expression. “Not exactly the 
Hope diamond.” He left the stone 
on the stand, sat down beside Glo- 
ria. “I guess an explanation is in 
order.” 

“To say the least,” Gloria said. 
“You’ve lost your mind, right?” 
“Matter of fact, I haven’t — but 
NASA’s lost a moon rock.” He 
rose and put the stone in Gloria’s 
hand. “This came,” he said, feeling 
the wonder of it, wondering what 
he was getting into, “from the 
moon. Honest to God. Apollo 
Eleven.” 

Gloria studied the stone. Gloria 
finished her martini. Beldini began 
to recognize that he might be in 
trouble. “Would it be too much,” 
Gloria said, “to ask how you came 
by this small bauble?” 

“Not at all. I lifted it from the 
exhibit at the AAAS meeting.” 

“I see. Yes. And you’re proud 
as a damned peacock, aren’t you?” 
“It was a pretty slick job.” 

“Fill my glass, Giuseppe, 
please.” 



“Certainly.” 

“And next time let me make the 
martinis. Would it be indiscreet to 
ask what you intend to do with 
this?” 

Beldini, replenishing both glass- 
es, eyed Gloria warily. “Well,” he 
said, “I don’t rightly know yet. 

I—” 

“Yes?” Tippy-tap of pointed toe 
on carpet. “Joseph?” 

She’d never called him that be- 
fore; Beldini didn’t like the sound 
of it. “Money,” Beldini said, and 
the words began to pour out. “I’ll 
sell it to some collector. We want 
to be married and you’re al- 
ways — ” He went on like that for 
a while. 

“Why not try for the Mona Lisa 
next time?” Gloria said, her tone 
etched in acid. Not LSD, more like 
fuming nitric. “There really is a 
ready market for stolen moon 
rocks, right?” 

“Well, there are problems but — 
why are you putting on your 
coat?” 

“I’m getting out of here. Right 
now. You think I want to live with 
a cheap common crook, you got 
another think coming, Joseph, old 
boy.” 

He caught up with her in the 
slushy street. 

“1 may be a crook,” he said, 
“but, by God, I’m not a cheap one. 
That was one hell of a classy heist. 
A moon rock!” He hoped he 
wasn’t about to cry but he felt like 
it and Gloria, woman that she was.

got the message. They went back 
to the apartment. She mixed (ex- 
pertly) another pitcher of martinis. 

“You did it for me, didn’t you, 
you stupid bastard?” She didn’t 
wait for an answer. “Let’s call up 
for some pizzas, right?” 

“Pizzas, my foot,” he said. 
“We’re going to Charles. You will 
have the filetto Caterina di Medici 
and I will have salsiccie. There will 
be wine.” He withdrew from Glo- 
ria’s impressive cleavage a large 
bouquet of roses of red paper. 

“Do you have to do that all the 
time?” she asked, not really put 
off. “What did I ever do,” she 
thoughtfully asked somebody, 
something, somewhere, “to deserve 
you?” 

Wine in the glasses, then, can- 
dles on the table, and Beldini say- 
ing he would take Gloria to Napo- 
li next year, and she nodding. 

“A plain brown parcel,” she 
said, as one would speak to a child. 
“Tomorrow. No return address, 
right?” 

“What?” 

“Tomorrow you send the moon 
rock back to NASA.” 

“But—” 

“No. No buts. The filetto,” she 
said, “is delicious.” 

G loria snuggled gently. 

“What happened to Linda?” she 
said, sleepily. Linda was, had been, 
Beldini’s second and only other 
wife. 

“Mmmm,” said Beldini. 



“You’re not asleep yet, you fak- 
er. What happened to Linda?” 
“Would you believe another un- 
trained assistant?” Beldini 
stretched, and assumed the fetal 
position. “Her name was Martha. 
She had red hair and freckles.” 
“Screw Martha,” Gloria said. 
“And no doubt you did. But what 
happened to Linda?” 

“The vanishing box,” Beldini 
mumbled. Gloria, wakening, hit 
him on the shoulder. “Well,” he 
said, “when we drew the curtain on 
the other box, on the other side of 
the stage, where Linda was sup- 
posed to be — nothing. It was emp- 
ty. Mmmm.” 

“Stay awake yet, you damned 
idiot. Then what?” 

Beldini sighed. He was replete, 
satisfied, gone to there and back 
with salsiccie, Chianti and Gloria. 
He wanted to go to sleep but he 
knew which side his broad was bet- 
ter on. “All right,” he said. “Linda 
had been giving me a hard time 
and I thought she was just screwing 
up the act to make me look like an 
idiot child up there.” 

“Not hard to do,” Gloria whis- 
pered. 

“What?” 

“Nothing. Go on.” Gloria as- 
sumed the fetal position, listening. 

“I gave the sign to drop the big 
curtain, went out front to finish 
the schtick as best I could. And it 
wasn’t a very good house, either. 
Bad show. Then Martha and I 
looked all over and everywhere

Linda could have been- she wasn’t. 
She’d blown the scene, like, she 
was gone. No trace. Then or ever. 
All right?” 

“You say the damndest things,” 
Gloria said. Beldini now wasn’t 
sure he wanted to go to sleep. He 
made a move. “No,” Gloria said. 
“For Pete’s sake, act your age.” 
“Mmmm.” 

“Remind me never to appear in 
an act with you, all right?” 

“All right.” 

N ext morning Beldini lathered 
his face and pulled coins from 
the air, same as yesterday. But this 
morning he’d awakened when Glo- 
ria had and they had talked. A long 
time. At the end of it: “Be sure to 
send the rock back to NASA,” she 
said. 

“All right. Just ‘Houston’ ought 
to get it there. No return address.” 
“That’s right. Wrap it up, put 
some stamps on,” she said, fixing 
her hair, “and drop it into a mail- 
box.” Beldini nodded. “Then you’ll 
be an honest man again. At least 
you won’t have a hot rock in your 
pants.” 

“A baked potato,” he said. “I 
know you don’t want to live with 
a crook. So — I won’t be one.” 
Gloria was at the door. “I know 
why you heisted the rock,” she 
said. “We’ll work something out. 
We will.” 

Then she was gone — leaving the 
scent of her presence and, as it 
were, a promissory note. 



Beldini carefully, sadly, enclosed 
the moon rock in layers of news- 
papers, which was all he had by 
way of packing material. He was 
rummaging around for a card- 
board carton when the presence ap- 
peared. It didn’t come through the 
door or anything — it was just 
standing there between him and the 
moon rock, where only the tacky 
carpet had been before. It had 
numbers of legs and arms but only 
one head. Beldini rose, backed 
warily against the wall. 

“Nothing to fear,” a voice said. 
Beldini thought the intonation 
Slavonic. 

Beldini asked the questions usu- 
al in such situations: who, from 
where, why, like that, but without 
waiting for answers said, “I hope 
you won’t mind if I say I find 
your, er, materialization offen- 
sive?” 

“Of course not.” The visitor 
shimmered, disappeared, and came 
back, this time in the semblance of 
what might have been a six-legged 
armadillo. Buying time, thinking, 
wondering, Beldini shook his head. 

“Stupid of me,” the visitor said, 
shimmering again. This time it was 
a naked girl — about eighteen, say, 
with long blonde hair — with the 
kind of attributes you’d expect if 
you could make them yourself, no 
pun intended. 

She was free of all shyness, 
though Beldini knew he was flush- 
ing and cursed himself for it. 

“It’s just that we need the — 



92 



GALAXY 




rock,” she said, in her voice a note 
of apology. 

“But I’m about to return it to 
NASA—” 

“It’s ours. We do need it.” 

“Who’s we?” 

She, or it, or whatever, sat Bel- 
dini on the sofa beside her, not a 
difficult achievement under the cir- 
cumstances. “Would you be more 
comfortable if I put some clothes 
on?” 

“Certainly not,” Beldini said. 
fVait until / tell Gloria, he 
thought, knowing he would never 
tell Gloria. 

The girl told it simply and effec- 
tively; what it boiled down to was 
that they were from way out there 
and Beldini’s supposed stone was a 
most sophisticated communicative 
device they had placed on the 
moon — where Apollo Eleven hap- 
pened to land. How long ago? 
About 28,000 years, earth time. 

“Back to Two Thousand and 
One” Beldini muttered. 

“What?” 

“A film of ours, some time 
back, same idea.” 

It searched her memory or he 
searched its — or whatever. “Oh. 
Yes, well, you have the idea then.” 

Beldini unwrapped the stone. 
“This tiny thing?” 

“Sentinels don’t have to be 
crude twenty-foot monoliths,” she 
said, with something of scorn in 
her voice. “This can do everything 
that one did, and more.” 

“Prove that it’s yours,” said 



Beldini, suddenly honest, trying to 
keep his eyes away. 

“Well — just me, my materiali- 
zation. I can show you others — ” 
“Stay as sweet as you are,” Bel- 
dini said, remembering all those 
legs. He cautiously put his hand on 
hers, with no disastrous effects. It 
felt like a warm human hand. 
You’ve got to start someplace. 
“Why did it take you so long to 
come after it?” he asked. “Apollo 
Eleven was weeks ago.” 

“We’re from way out there,” 
she reminded him. “Even with su- 
perwarp and hyperspace-over- 
drive.” 

“Yes. I’d forgotten. What’s 
your name?” She blinked lashes at 
him. “That’s silly, of course, you 
don’t have one of our names — 
though, I must say, you look like 
one of us. I mean, I ought to call 
you something.” 

“How about Lorna?” 

“Lorna’s fine,” Beldini said. “It 
suits you. Look, Lorna — ” He 
held her hand in his and it was still 
warm and responsive. Beldini re- 
sponded and Lorna perceived that. 

“We do good materializations, 
Joe,” she said. 

Beldini sighed. “Tell me this, 
then — don’t do it but tell me. You 
want the stone and 1 have it. Why 
don’t you materialize yourself into 
a — don’t do it, I said — into a, shall 
we say, more powerful man than I 
and just take it away? Beat me to 
a pulp. If you can come from out 
there to here and — ” 



MOON HEAT

“Can’t do it that way,” Lorna 
said. “There’s this stupid provision 
in the Codex. We can do every- 
thing except use force. All I can do 
is — persuade you, Joe.” She came 
closer. “Our information is that 
you — earthlings are on the thresh- 
old of becoming reasonable — ” 

You may be misinformed, Bel- 
dini thought, absently putting a 
hand on Lorna’s knee. 

“We’ll reward you,” Lorna said. 
A softness, materialized in her 
eyes, with nothing of softness in 
Beldini responding. 

Beldini crossed his Rubicon. “If 
it’s yours,” he, man of virtue, said. 
“You should have it. Could you 
just — do something with it, to 
show — ” 

Lorna gently dislodged both of 
Beldini’s hands, materialized some- 
thing that looked like a cigarette 
lighter and flicked a switch. The 
stone became luminescent. “Don’t 
look right at it,” Lorna said. Sub- 
liminal happenings were beginning 
to form themselves in Beldini’s 
mind. Emanations were issuing 
from the stone, Beldini knew, but 
he didn’t know how he knew that. 
He heard nothing but felt his brain 
expanding inside his skull until he 
knew it would pop open and a little 
chick would hop out. 

He said, “All right, already, 
turn it off,” and Lorna did. 

“So take the stone,” he said. 

Together on the sofa again. 

“Thank you, Joe,” Lorna said. 
“You will be rewarded.” 



“How?” he asked. Thinking of 
money, thinking of pearls and ru- 
bies, thinking of Gloria. 

“How about this for openers?” 
Lorna reached for Beldini’s but- 
tons, looking for parts of him with 
parts of her. When he was naked 
as she Beldini — almost absently 
— produced a Nicaraguan flag 
from the general area of Lorna’s 
dainty pubis. 

“That’s funny,” Lorna said. 
“Do you know any more tricks?” 

That’s what you ask about a 
dog, he thought. “It’s not easy to 
do them, not that kind, naked,” he 
said. Lorna was a vision and Beldi- 
ni lost his cool — but in the end, 
alas, Gloria’s image intruded. Bel- 
dini explained. 

“No offense, Joe,” Lorna said. 
“I’m not really a girl anyway. But 
we do materialize well, don’t we?” 

“You certainly do,” said Beldi- 
ni, sitting there naked as a jaybird, 
wondering why he was carrying 
matters of conscience or some- 
thing to what must be either psy- 
chotic or imbecilic length. 

Lorna rose, shrugged her shoul- 
ders in an oddly unhuman way and 
took the rock in her hands. “I say 
this, Joe — you will be rewarded. 
Goodbye. I’m sorry, in a way, you 
didn’t want me. It might have been 
interesting. But I understand. See 
you later.” 

And she was gone, the sentinel 
with her. Beldini looked at the 
newspaper he’d wrapped the stone 
in, looked at his clothes strewn all 



94 



GALAXY 




over the room. Well, he thought, 
:it least I won’t have to go to the 
mailbox. 

<<¥ SWEAR on a stack of Bibles, 

*or on anything else, including 
your popliteal fossa,” Beldini said, 
“that the moon rock is on its way 
to its proper owners.” 

This was an indirect answer, but 
It satisfied Gloria. “Good,” she 
said and in the saying was some- 
thing different about her. Beldini 
couldn’t put a finger on it. He 
could put both hands on her, all 
ten fingers, yes, but could not spot 
the different — something. A 

warmth, a softness. “We’ll have 
pizzas in tonight, yes? And Chian- 
ti?” 

“Yes.” This seemed a night for 
having pizzas in. 

“I’ve had a hard day,” Gloria 
said. “You call, and I’ll take a 
bath while they’re coming. Make 
mine pepperoni.” 

Beldini went to the living room 
and phoned in the order. He went 
back into the bedroom to change 
into something more comfortable. 
Gloria was in the bathroom. The 
door was about half open, the wa- 
ter was running. Beldini stepped to- 
ward that door and collided with — 
Lorna. His pupils dilated. “Get — ” 
He started to whisper, but Lorna 



was full of something. 

“I said you’d be rewarded,” she 
said. Beldini thanked a number of 
deities that the water was running. 

“It’s all right,” he said, “I really 
don’t care. Just take the rock and 
go, all right? Like now?” 

Lorna was miffed. “All right,” 
she said, “but first — ” 

She did something and the walls 
of the room seemed to move a lit- 
tle, and one of Beldini’s vanishing 
boxes was out of its trunk and as- 
sembled in the middle of the room. 

“We do appreciate your coop- 
eration,” Lorna said. “We’re non- 
violent, so we have to have coop- 
eration. Thanks, Joe.” 

She gave him a sweet kiss and 
was gone. 

At that moment the water 
stopped running in the bathroom — 
and Linda stepped out of the bat- 
tered vanishing box. She seemed a 
bit muddled, for which she might 
possibly be forgiven. “It wasn’t 
easy finding her,” Beldini heard, as 
from an astral plane. “Goodbye, 
Joe.” 

Linda wore the costume she’d 
worn the night of her disappear- 
ance. Beldini remembered it. 

“Beldini?” Linda said, wonder- 
ing, approaching him. 

“What was that, Joe?” Gloria 
called from the bathroom. ★

I can’t see why a Latin polysylla- 
ble makes me more a lady than a 
monosyllable with the same mean- 
ing. You and I think with the same 
brain — yours — eat with the same 
mouth — mine, or used to be- and 
pee through the same hole. So why 
shouldn’t we share the same vocab- 
ulary? Speaking of peeing — oh, 
pardon me, sir, 1 meant to say

speaking of micturation, that we

don’t dare leave; it’s dark out

(Okay, Eunice, you’ve made

(Have I offended you again. 
Boss?) 

(Eunice, you have never of- 
fended me. Sometimes you have 
startled me, sometimes you have 
surprised me — and often delighted 
me. But you have never offended 
me. Not even with that list of 
blunt words.) 

(Well ... as I saw it, if you al-

really be offended; if you didn’t

understand them, then you 
couldn’t possibly be offended.) 

(All right, dear. I’ll quit trying 
to correct your speech. But for the 
record — I used all those words 
long before your mother was 
born. Possibly before your grand- 
mother was born.) (Grandma is

(No, they’re just words. Short- 
talk.) 

(Not short-talk, as they were 
used before video corrupted the 
language. Except — What was that 
one word? ‘Primp’?) 

(Oh. Shouldn’t have included 
that one. Boss; it’s not a classic 
word. Current slang, swing talk. 
It’s a general verb, one which in- 
cludes every possible way to copu- 
late — ) (Pfui! You youngsters. 
When I was a kid, we had at least 
two dozen words meaning ‘frimp,’ 
some new, some old, besides the 
standard taboo words for it.) (You 
didn’t let me finish. Boss. Every 
possible way to hook up two or 
more bodies — any number — of 
any sex, or combinations of all six 
sexes, and including far-out varia- 
tions that would shock you right 
out of this bed. But swing is a to- 
day scene, so it’s not surprising 
you hadn’t heard the word ‘frimp’ 
before.) 

(Oh, I’d heard it. 1 have news 
for you, infant.) 

(Yes, sir? I mean ‘Yes, Miss 
Smith,’ dearie. 'Miss’ Smith — 
what a giggle I got when 1 first 
heard it. But it’s nice, since it 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



means both of us. Say, Rosy is all 
right, isn’t he? Puts more into 
hand-kissing than some studs do 
into a romp on the pad.) (Sweet- 
heart, you not only have a dirty 
mind — but it veers.) (How can I 
help having a dirty mind when 
it’s actually yours, Boss — I’m hip 
deep in the stuff.) (Shut up, 
Eunice; it’s my turn. The swing 
scene is nothing new. The Greeks 
had a word for it. So did the Ro- 
mans. And so on through history. 
The orgy was relished in Victorian 
England. It was far from unknown 
in my youth in the heart of the Bi- 
ble Belt, even though it was dan- 
gerous in those days. Eunice, as 
long as we are trying to get easy 
with each other, let me say this: 
Anything you’ve ever seen, or 
tried, or heard of, I did, or had 
done to me, before your grand- 
mother was born — and if I liked 
it, I did it again and again and 
again. No matter how risky.) 

T he second voice was silent a 
moment. (Maybe we simply 
start younger today. Less risk and 
fewer rules.) 

(Beg to doubt.) 

(Oh, I’m sure we do. I told you 
how young I was when I got 
caught. Fifteen. And I started a 
year younger.) 

(Eunice my love, the main dif- 
ference between the young and the 
old, the cause ^of the so-called 
Generation Gap — a gap in under- 
standing that has existed through- 
out all time — is that the young 
simply cannot believe that the old 
ever really were young . where- 
as to an old person his youth is 
something that happened just last 

99 




week, and it annoys the hell out of 
him when someone in effect denies 
that this old duffer ever owned a 
youth.) 

(Boss?) The thought was gentle 
and soft.- 

(Yes, dearest?) 

(Boss, I always knew you were 
young underneath, behind all those 
horrid liver spots — knew it when I 
was alive, I mean . and wished 
dreadfully that you weren’t old 
and sick in your body. It hurt me 
so, to see you hurt. Sometimes I 
went home and cried. Especially 
when it made you cross and you 
would say something you didn’t 
mean and then be sorry. I wanted 
you to get well . and knew you 
couldn’t. 1 was one of the first to 
sign up — Joe and I both — as soon 
as word reached us through the 
Rare Blood Club. Couldn’t do it 
sooner or you might have found 
out — and forbidden me to.) 

(Eunice, Eunice!) 

(Don’t you believe me?) 

(Yes, darling, yes . but you’re 
making us cry.) 

(So blow your nose, and stop it. 
Because everything turned out all 
right. Look, you wanted to hear 
about my little bastard — will that 
take your mind off troubles we no 
longer have?) 

(Uh . only if you want to, 
Eunice. My love. My only love.) 

(I made it plain that I wanted to 
tell you, didn’t I? I’ll tell all — and 
that’ll take a long time — if you 
want to hear. If you won’t be 
shocked. Say ‘Please,’ Boss — be- 
cause the details of my sex life 
ought to help you in handling your 
own sex life. Our sex life, that is. 
Or did you mean that stuff you 

100 



were shoveling at Dr. Garcia 
about not being ‘actively female’?) 

(Uh ... I don’t know, Eunice, 
I haven’t been a woman long 
enough to know what I want. 
Shucks, darling, instead of think- 
ing like a girl I’m still ogling girls. 
That little redheaded nurse, for ex- 
ample.) 

(So I noticed.) 

(Was that sarcasm? Or jeal- 
ousy?) 

(What? I do not intend to be 
sarcastic. Boss dear; I don’t want 
us ever to be nasty with each 
other. And jealousy is just a word 
in the dictionary to me. I simply 
meant that, when Winnie was 
making up our face and you were 
sneaking a peek down the neck of 
her smock every time she leaned 
over, I was staring as hard as you 
were. No bra. Cute ones, aren’t 
they? Winnie is female and knows 
it. If you were male in your body 
as well as in your head, I wouldn’t 
trust her as far as I could throw a 
bed.) 

(I thought you said you weren’t 
jealous?) 

(I’m not. I merely meant that 
Winnie would trip you and beat 
you to the floor. But I was not 
criticizing her. I’ve nothing 
against girls. A girl can be quite a 
blast.) 

J OHANN was slow in answering. 

(Eunice, uh, were you implying 
that you have — used to have — re- 
lations with other, uh — ) 

(Oh, Boss, don’t be so early 
twentieth century; we’ve turned the 
corner on the twenty-first. Tell it 
bang. Do you mean ‘Am I a Lez?’ 
Homosexual?) 



GALAXY 




(No, not at all! Well, perhaps I 
did mean that in a way. At least I 
wanted you to clear up what you 
meant. As it didn’t seem possible. 
You were married and or was 
your marriage just a coverup? 1 
suppose — ) 

(Quit supposing, dear. Bang. I 
was not homosexual and neither is 
.loe. Joe is a tomcat always ready 
to yowl and wonderful at it. Ex- 
cept when he’s painting; then he 
forgets everything else. But ‘homo- 
sexual’ isn’t a word that bothers 
anyone my age, either the word or 
the fact. And why should it be with 
the Government practically sub- 
sidizing it with propaganda about 
loo many babies that starts in kin- 
dergarten? If I had taken the Bili- 
tis pledge, I would never have had 
that phony ‘rheumatic fever.’ But, 
while girls are cuddly and I’ve nev- 
er had any inhibitions about them, 
1 always — far too interested 

in boys to live on Gay Street. But 
which team are you on. Boss? One 
minute you’re telling me how you 
drool over Winnie, the next min- 
ute you seem upset that I drooled, 
too. So what are you going to do 
with us, dear? Left-handed? Right- 
handed? Both hands? Or no hands 
at all? I guess I could stand any- 
thing but that last. Do I have a 
vote?) 

(Why, of course you do.) 

(I wonder. Boss. You sputtered 
when I suggested that you could 
thank Doc Hedrick in bed . and 
sparked some more at the notion 
of going to bed with a girl. Sure 
you’re not planning on sewing it 
up?) 

(Oh, Eunice, don’t talk silly! 
Beloved, happy as I am that we 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



are together, that ‘generation gap’ 
is still there. My fault this time, 
as I have a life-long habit of being 
careful in what 1 say to a woman, 
even one 1 am in bed with ) 

(You’re certainly in bed with 
me\) 

(1 certainly am. And I’m finding 
it even harder to be flatly truthful 
with you- ‘tell it bang’ as you say 
— than to adjust to being female. 
But before Dr. Hedrick brought 
up the matter 1 saw the implica- 
tions — and complications — and 

consequences — of being female 
. and young . and rich.) 

(‘Rich.’ I hadn’t thought about 
that one.) 

(Eunice beloved, we’re going to 
have to think about it. Of course 
we’re going to be ‘actively fe- 
male— ’) 

{Hooray\) 

(Quiet, dear. If we were poor, 
the simplest thing would be to ask 
your Joe to take us back. If he 
would have us. But we aren’t poor; 
we’re embarrassingly rich — and a 
fortune is harder to get rid of than 
it is to accumulate. Believe me. 
When I was about seventy-five, I 
tried to unload my wealth while I 
was still living so that it would not 
go to my granddaughters. But to 
give away money without wasting 
most of it in the process is as dif- 
ficult as getting the genie back in- 
to the bottle. So I gave up and 
simply arranged my will to keep 
most of it out of the hands of my 
alleged descendants.) 

(‘Alleged?’) 

(Alleged. Eunice, my first wife 
was a sweet girl, much like your- 
self, I think. But the poor dear 
died in childbirth — bearing my one 

101 




son, also dead for many years 
now. Agnes had made me promise 
to marry again and I did, almost 
at once. One daughter from that 
marriage and her mother divorced 
me before the child was a year old. 
1 married a third time — again one 
daughter, again a divorce. 1 never 
knew my daughters well and out- 
lived both of them and their moth- 
ers. But — Eunice, you’re a rare- 
blood yourself; do you know how 
blood types are inherited?) 

(Not really.) 

(Thought you might. Being 
mathematically inclined, the first 
time 1 laid eyes on an inheritance 
chart for blood types 1 understood 
it as well as I understand the mul- 
tiplication tables. Having lost my 
first wife to childbirth, with both 
my second and third wives I made 
certain that donors were at hand 
before they went into delivery 
rooms. Second wife was type A, 
third was type B — years later 1 
learned that both my putative 
daughters were type O.) 

(I think 1 missed something. 
Boss.) 

(Eunice, it is impossible for a 
type-AB father to sire type-O 
children. Now wait--I did not 
hold it against my daughters; it 
was none of their doing. I would 
have loved Evelyn and Roberta - 
tried to, wanted to — but their 
mothers kept me away from them 
and turned them against me. 
Neither girl had any use for me 
. until it turned out that I was 
going to dispose of a lot of money 
some day — and then the switch 
from honest dislike to phony ‘af- 
fection’ was nauseating. I feel no 
obligation to my granddaughters 

102 



since in fact they are not my 
granddaughters. Well? What do 
you think?) 

(Uh- Boss, 1 don’t see any 
need to comment.) 

(So? Who was it not five min- 
utes ago was saying that we ought 
to be absolutely frank with each 
other?) 

(Well ... I don’t disagree with 
your conclusion. Boss, just with 
how you reached it. I don’t see 
that heredity should enter into it. 
Seems to me you are resenting 
something that happened a long 
time ago — and that’s not good. 
Not good for you. Boss.) 

(Child, you don’t know what 
you’re talking about.) 

(Maybe not.) 

(No maybe’s about it. A baby 
is a baby is a baby. Babies are to 
love and take care of and that’s 
what this whole bloody mess is 
about, else none of it makes sense. 
Eunice, I told you that my first 
wife was something like you. Ag- 
nes was my Annabel Lee and we 
loved with a love that was more 
than a love and I had her for only 
a year — then she died giving me 
my son. Then I loved him just as 
much. When he was killed some- 
thing died inside me . and 1 
made a foolish fourth marriage 
hoping to bring it alive again by 
having another son. But I was 
lucky that time — no children and 
it merely cost me a chunk of mon- 
ey to get shut of it.) 

(I’m sorry, Boss.) 

(Nothing to be sorry about now. 
But I was telling you something 
else — Eunice, when we’re up and 
around, remind me to dig into my 
jewelry case and show you my 



GALAXY 




son’s dog tag — all that I have left 
of him.) 

(If you want to. But isn’t that 
morbid, dear? Look forward, not 
back.) 

(Depends on how you look 
back. I don’t grieve over him; I’m 
proud of him. He died honorably, 
fighting for his country. But that 
military dog tag shows his blood 
type. Type O.) 

(Oh.) 

(Yes, I said ‘O.’ So my son was 
no more my physical descendant 
than were my daughters. Didn’t 
keep me from loving him.) 

(Yes but — you learned it from 
his identification tag? After he was 
dead?) 

(Like hell I did. 1 knew it the 
day he was born; 1 had suspected 
that he might not be mine from 
the time Agnes turned out to be 
pregnant — and I accepted it. Eu- 
nice, 1 wore horns with dignity and 
always kept suspicions to myself. 
Just as well — as all my wives con- 
tributed to my cornute state. 
Horns? Branching antlers! The 
husband who expects anything else 
is riding for a fall. But I never had 
illusions about it, so it never took 
me by surprise. No reason why it 
should, as 1 got the best parts of 
my own training from married 
women, starting clear back in my 
early teens. 1 think that happens 
in every generation. But horns 
make a man’s head ache only when 
he’s stupid enough to believe that 
his wife is different — when all the 
evidence he has accumulated 
should cause him to assume the 
exact opposite.) 

(Boss, you think all women are 
like that?) 



(Oh, no! In my youth I knew 
many marriages in which both the 
bride and groom, to the best of 
my knowledge and belief, went to 
the altar virgin and stayed faithful 
a lifetime. There may be couples 
like that among you kids today.) 

(Some, I think. But you 
couldn’t prove it by me.) 

(Nor by me. Nor by all the kin- 
seys who ever collected statistics. 
Eunice, sex is the one subject ev- 
erybody lies about. But what I was 
saying is this: A man who takes 
his fun where he finds it, then mar- 
ries and expects his wife to be dif- 
ferent, is a fool. I wasn’t that sort 
of fool. Let me tell you about Ag- 
nes. 

(Agnes was an angel — with 
round heels. That’s obsolete slang 
which means what is sounds like. 
I don’t think Agnes ever hated 
anyone in her short life and she 
loved as easily as she breathed. 
She — Eunice, you said you had 
started young?) 

(Fourteen, Boss. Precocious 
slut, huh?) 

(Precocious possibly, a slut nev- 
er. Nor was my angel Agnes ever 
a slut and she happily gave away 
her virginity — so she told me — at 
twelve. I — ) 

{Twelve]) 

(Surprised, dear? That genera- 
tion gap again; your generation 
thinks it invented sex. Agnes was 
precocious; sixteen was fairly 
young in those days, from what a 
male could guess about it — not 
much! — and seventeen or eighteen 
was more common. 1 think. Actu- 
ally encountering female virginity 
and being certain of it — well. I’m 



I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



103 




no expert. But Agnes wasn’t hang- 
ing up a record even for those 
days; I recall a girl in my gram- 
mar school who was ‘putting out,’ 
as kids called it then, at eleven — 
and getting away with it cold, 
teacher’s pet and butter wouldn’t 
melt in her mouth and winning 
pins for Sunday School attendance. 

(My darling Agnes was like that 
except that Agnes’s goodness 
wasn’t pretense; she was good all 
the way through. She simply didn’t 
see anything sinful about sex.) 

(Boss, sex is not sinful.) 

(Did I ever say it was? However, 
in those days I felt guilty about it, 
until Agnes cured me of such non- 
sense. She was sixteen and I was 
twenty and her father was a prof 
at the cow college I went to and I 
was invited to their hous'e for din- 
ner one Sunday night — and our 
first time happened on their living 
room sofa so fast it startled me, 
scared me some.) 

(What frightened you, dear? Her 
parents?) 

(Well, yes. Just upstairs and 
probably not asleep. Agnes being 
so young herself — age of consent 
was eighteen then and while I don’t 
recall ever letting it stop me, boys 
were jumpy about it. And that 
night I wasn’t prepared, not having 
expected it.) 

(Prepared how. Boss?) 

(Contraception. I had a year to 
go to get my degree, and no mon- 
ey and no job lined up, and having 
to get married wasn’t something 
I relished.) 

(But contraception is a girl’s 
responsibility. Boss. That’s why I 
felt so silly when I got caught. I 
wouldn’t have dreamed of asking 

104 



a boy to marry me on that ac- 
count — even if I had been certain 
which boy. Once I knew I was 
caught I gritted my teeth and told 
my parents and took my scolding 
— Daddy was going to have to pay 
my fine; I was not yet licensed. 
Grim — but no talk of getting mar- 
ried. I wasn’t asked who did it and 
never volunteered an opinion.) 

(Didn’t you have an opinion, 
Eunice?) 

(Well . just an opinion. Let 
me tell it bang. Our basketball 
team and us three girl cheerleaders 
were all in the same hotel, with 
the coach and the girls’ phys-ed 
teacher riding herd on us. Only 
they didn’t; they went out on the 
town. So we gathered to celebrate 
in the suite the boys were in. 
Somebody had lettuce. Marijuana. 
I took two puffs and didn’t like it 
— and went back to gin and ginger 
ale which tasted better and was al- 
most as new to me. Didn’t have 
any intention of swinging; it wasn’t 
the smart scene at our school and 
I had a steady I was faithful to — 
well, usually — who wasn’t on the 
trip. But when the head cheerlead- 
er took her clothes off — well, 
there it was. So I counted days in 
my mind and decided I was safe by 
two days and peeled down, last of 
three to do so. Nobody made me 
do it. Boss, no slightest flavor of 
rape. So how could I blame the 
boys?) 

(Only it turned out I didn’t have 
two days leeway and by the middle 
of January I was fairly certain. 
Then I was certain. Then my par- 
ents were certain — and I 'was sent 
south to stay with an aunt while I 
recovered from rheumatic fever I 



GALAXY 




never had. And recovered two hun- 
dred and sixty-nine days after that 
championship game, barely in time 
to enter school in the fall. And 
graduated with my class.) 

(But your baby, Eunice? Boy? 
Girl? How old now? Twelve? And 
where is the child?) 

(Boss, I don’t know. I signed an 
adoption waiver so that Daddy 
would get his money back if some- 
body with a baby license came 
along. Boss, is that fair? Five 
thousand dollars was a lot of mon- 
ey to my father — yet anyone on 
Welfare gets off free, or can even 
demand a free abortion. 1 can’t 
see it.) 

(You changed the subject, dear. 
Your baby?) 

■ (Oh. They told me it was born 
dead. But I hear they usually say 
that if a girl signs the papers arid 
somebody is waiting for it.) 

(We can find out. If your baby 
didn’t live, then the fine was nev- 
er levied. Didn’t your father tell 
you?) 

(I never asked. It was a touchy 
subject, Boss. It was ‘rheumatic 
fever,’ never an unlicensed baby. 
Just as well, I guess, as when I 
turned eighteen, I was licensed for 
three with no questions raised.) 

(Eunice, no matter what cover- 
up was used, if your baby is living, 
we can find it!) 

The second voice did not answer. 
Johann persisted. (Well, Eunice?) 

(Boss . it’s better to let the 
dead past bury its dead.) 

(You don’t want children, Eu- 
nice?) 

(That wasn’t what I said. You 
said it didn’t matter that your son 
wasn’t really yours. I think you 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



were right. But doesn’t it cut both 
ways? If there is a child some- 
where, almost thirteen now — we’re 
strangers. I’m not the mother who 
loved it and brought it up; I’m 
nobody. Really nobody — you for- 
get that I was killed.) 

(Eunice! Oh, darling!) 

(You see? If we found that boy, 
or girl, we couldn’t admit that 
I’m still alive — alive again, I mean 
— inside your head. That’s the 
thing we don’t dare admit ... or 
back they come with those horrid 
straps and we’ll never be free.) 
She sighed. (But I wish I could 
have had your baby. You were 
telling me about Agnes, dearest. 
Tell me more. Am I really some- 
what like her?) 

(Very much like her, Eunice. 
Oh, I don’t mean she looked like 
you. But if I believed in reincarna- 
tion — I don’t — I would be tempted 
to think that you were Agnes, 
come back to me.) 

(Maybe I am. Why don’t you 
believe in it. Boss?) 

(Uh ... do you?) 

(No. I mean I didn’t believe in 
it, even though most of our friends 
did. I couldn’t see any reason to 
believe either way, so I kept my 
mouth shut. But, Boss, it gives 
one a different viewpoint to have 
been killed . and then turn out 
not to stay dead. Dearest Boss — 
you think I’m a figment of your 
imagination, don’t you?) 



J OHANN did not answer. The 
voice went on; (Don’t be afraid 
to admit it. Boss; you won’t of- 
fend me. / know I’m me. I don’t 
need proof. But you do. You need 

105 




to know. Admit it, darling. Be 
open with me.) 

She sighed again. (Eunice, I do 
need to know. But — if I’m crazy 
— if you are just my own mind 
talking back to me — I’d rather 
not know it. Darling, forgive me 
. but I was relieved when you 
told me that you didn’t want us to 
try to find your baby.) 

(I knew you were relieved . 
and I knew why. Boss, don’t be so 
right-now. We have all the time in 
the world, so relax and be happy. 
Proof will turn up — something I 
know and that you couldn’t possi- 
bly know except through me. And 
that will be that, and you will be 
as certain as I am.) 

Johann nodded to herself. (That 
makes sense, Eunice — and it 
sounds like the scoldings you used 
to give me when I got fretful. You 
used to mother me.) 

(I’m going to go right on moth- 
ering you, and scolding you when 
you need it — and loving you all 
the time. Boss. But there is one 
thing there is some hurry about.) 

(What?) 

(That bedpan. Unless you want 
us to have a childish accident.) 

(Oh, damn!) 

(Relax, Boss. Get used to it.) 

(Damnation, I do not want to 
be placed on a bedpan by a nurse 
like a baby being put to potty. 
You know what’ll happen? Noth- 
ing! I’ll clamp down and not be 
able to do it. Eunice, there’s my 
bathroom through that door — 
can’t we ask to be helped into there 
. .and left in private?) 

(Boss, you know what would 
happen. You ring for the nurse 
and tell her. She’ll try to argue 

106 



you out of it. Then she’ll go find 
Dr. Garcia. He’ll show up and 
argue, too. If you’re stubborn, 
he’ll get Jake. By the time Jake 
shows up, we’ve wet the bed.) 

(Eunice, you’re infuriating. All 
right, let’s ring for that goddam 
pan.) 

(Hold it. Boss. Can we get this 
side rail down?) 

(Huh?) 

(If we can, what’s stopping us 
from going to the bathroom with- 
out asking?) 

(But, Eunice — I haven’t walked 
in more than a year!) 

(That was before you got this 
secondhand, good-as-new, factory- 
reconditioned, female body. Boss.) 

(You think we can walk?) 

(Let’s find out. If standing up 
makes us dizzy, we can hang onto 
the bed and ease down to the floor. 
I’m certain we can crawl. Boss.) 

(Let’s do it!) 

(Let’s see how this side rail 
works.) 

J OHANN found the guard rails 
baffling. There seemed to be no 
way for a person in the bed to let 
them down. Not surprising, she 
told herself; if these bars were 
meant to protect a befuddled pa- 
tient, then proper design called for 
it to be impossible for a patient to 
remove them. (Eunice, we’re go- 
ing to have to ring for the nurse. 
Damn!) (Don’t give up. Boss. 
Maybe it’s a button on the con- 
sole. If we scrooch around till our 
head is at the foot, 1 think we can 
reach the console.) 

So Johann pulled up her knees 
and twisted and switched ends — 
and was surprised and delighted 

GALAXY 




at how limber her new body was. 
Then she stretched her right arm 
through the bars at the foot of the 
bed, could not quite reach the 
console — and cussed, and then 
discovered how the side rail 
locked — two simple catches, one 
for each side, at the foot of the 
bed below the springs, out of reach 
— no doubt the designer thought 
— of any patient ill enough to need 
the side rails. 

She thumbed open the leftside 
catch; the rail, counterweighted, 
pushed down easily. She giggled. 
(How’re we doing, partner?) (Fine 
so far. Boss. Hang onto the end of 
the bed while we get our feet down. 
Keel over and they’ll put us in a 
wet pack — so hang on!) 

Johann got her feet to the floor, 
stood trembling while she clung 
to the bed. (Dizzy.) (Of course. It 
will go away. Steady down, dear. 
Boss, I think we could walk . 
but let’s play safe and crawl. If we 
get dizzy again and take a dive on 
the rug, Winnie will be in here like 
a shot — and from then on they’ll 
feed us through the bars. What do 
you think?) (I think we had better 
reach that pot pronto before we 
have to blame it on the cat. We 
crawl.) 

Getting to the floor was no 
problem; crawling was another 
matter, she caught her knees on 
the hospital gown. So she sat up — 
Johann discovered that her new 
body folded easily and naturally 
into a contortion young Johann 
had found difficult at twelve. 

She did not stop to wonder. The 
bed jacket was no trouble; it fas- 
tened in front with a magnostrip, 
she shrugged it off and laid it 



aside. But the hospital gown fas- 
tened in back. (Stickstrip?) (Just 
a tie-tie. Feels like a bow knot. 
Careful, Boss, don’t snarl it.) 

The gown joined the jacket. Un- 
encumbered now, Johann resumed 
crawling. The bath-dressing room 
door snapped out of her way and 
she reached her objective. 

Presently she sighed in relief. 

(I feel better.) (That makes two 
of us. Want to try walking back? 

As far as we have something to 
grab onto? Or clear to the bed if | 
we whistle a chair and have it roll 
in front of us.) (I’m game.) 

Johann found that she was not 
unsteady on her feet — walking was 
easier than it had been for twenty 
years. Nevertheless she stayed 
close to the walls, the bathroom 
having been equipped years ago 
with grab rails for a frail old man 
grimly afraid of falling. It took 
her close to a tall three-way 
mirror in the dressing room end. 
She stopped. 

Then she stepped into the cen- 
tral spot and looked at herself. 
(My God, Eunice, but you’re 
beautiful!) 

(My God, but we’re a sloppy 
bitch! Boss, look at those toenails! 
Claws. Talons. And, oh dear, my 
breasts sag! And my belly is pos- 
itively flabby.) 

(Beautiful. Utterly gorgeous. 
Eunice beloved, I always wanted 
to see you starked naked. And 
now I do.) 

(So you do. I wish I had had 
time to get looking nice before 
you saw me. Hair a mess. And — 
yes, I thought so. We stink.) 
(Hey!) (Sorry, hit the panic but- 
ton by mistake. Boss, we’re go- 



1 WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



107 




ing to have a hot, soapy bath be- 
fore we get back into that bed. 
That’s straight from Washington. 
We can’t do much about flab in 
one day — but we can get clean.) 
She turned and inspected her but- 
tocks. (Oh, dear! A broad should 
be broad — but not that broad.) 
(Eunice, that’s the prettiest fanny 
in the state. In the whole country.) 
(Used to be, maybe. And it’s go- 
ing to be again and that’s a pro- 
mise, Boss. Tomorrow morning 
we start systematic exercise. 
Tighten up everything.) (Okay, if 
you say so — though I still say 
you’re the most gorgeously beau- 
tiful thing I ever saw in my life. 
Uh, Eunice? That mermaid getup 
you wore once — You were wear- 
ing a trick bra with it . .weren’t 
you?) 

She giggled. (Heavens, no. Just 
me, Boss. And paint. But my 
breasts were firm as rocks then; 
Joe had something to work with. I 
guess that’s the nakedest you’ve 
ever seen me.) 

(What do you think Em staring 
at now, Beautiful?) 

(Oh, I meant back before I was 
killed. When I was your ‘nice’ girl 
who didn’t dare let you see me as 
naked as I knew you would like, 
you dirty old man. Although you 
could have seen me naked — and 
much more beautiful — any time 
you had gotten up the nerve to 
ask.) 

(Em going to spend hours every 
day standing right here and star- 
ing.) 

(No reason why you shouldn’t 
dear; it’s your body now. But let’s 
put an exercise mat on the floor 
and get in that toning up at the 

108 



same time. Most exercises can be 
done better with the aid of a full- 
length mirror. I think we — ) 

The door snapped open. "Miss 
Smith!" 

J OHANN started with surprise, 
then answered savagely, “Miss 
Gersten, what the devil do you 
mean by bursting into my bath 
without knocking?” 

The nurse ignored the outburst, 
hurried to her patient, put an arm 
around her. “Lean on my shoul- 
der, let’s get you back into bed. 
Oh, dear, 1 don’t know what Dr. 
Garcia will say! He’ll kill me — are 
you all right?” Johann saw that the 
little nurse was about to cry. 

“Of course Em all right.” Jo- 
hann tried to shrug off the arm, 
found that the girl was stronger 
than she looked. “You didn’t an- 
swer.” 

The nurse did cry then. “Oh, 
please, dear, don’t argue with me! 
Let’s get you into bed before you 
hurt yourself. Maybe Dr. Garcia 
won’t be quite so angry.” 

Seeing that the younger woman 
was most unprofessionally dis- 
turbed, Johann let herself be urged 
out into the bedroom and to the 
bed. The little redhead caught her 
breath. “There! Now if you’ll 
hold tight around my neck, I can 
get your legs up — you bad, bad 
girl! To worry me so!” 

Johann did not cooperate. 
“Winnie.” 

“Yes, dear? Oh, do let me get 
you into bed! Doctor will be ter- 
ribly angry.” 

“Not so fast. If you’re planning 
on tell teacher, go do it. I can 
hang onto the bed, I won’t fall.” 

GALAXY 




The nurse looked desperate. 
“Are you trying to get me fired, 
Miss? Maybe Wack-listed? What 
have I ever done to you?” 

“Winnie, dear.” 

“Yes?” 

“You aren’t going to say a 
word to Dr. Garcia.” Johann slid 
an arm around the redhead’s waist. 
“Are you?” 

The nurse looked flustered but 
did not pull away. “Well, I should. 
I’m supposed to report every- 
thing.” 

“But you aren’t going to. And 
I’m not going to tell him, either. 
Tight secret, just you and me. And 
no huhu for anyone.” 

“Well ... I won’t if you won’t.” 

“Promise?” 

“I promise.” 

Johann kissed her. Winnie did 
not dodge but seemed startled 
and somewhat timid. Then she 
caught her breath and her lips 
opened and the kiss progressed 
rapidly. 

The nurse pulled her mouth free 
and said huskily, “I could get fired 
almost as quickly for this." She 
did not say what “this” was. She 
ignored the fact that Johann’s free 
hand was cupping one of her 
breasts. 

“So we’ll stop and I’ll get into 
bed — no, don’t help me; I don’t 
need it.” 

Johann proved it by doing it. 
The nurse pulled the sheet over 
her, at once resumed her profes- 
sional persona. “Now let’s put our 
clothes back on, shall we?” She 
stooped to retrieve them. “What a 
naughty girl, throwing her clothes 
on the floor. And giving me such 
a fright.” 



“Stuff ’em in the hamper. I’m 
not going to wear them.” 

“Now, now, dear. You needn’t 
wear the jacket. Just the gown. Or 
do you want a fresh one?” 

“Winnie, I’m not going to 
wear those silly angel robes ever 
again, so chuck it. You can hang 
up the jacket. But I won’t wear a 
hospital gown. I’ll stay raw.” 

“Dr. Garcia — ” 

“Quit threatening me with Dr. 
Garcia. We’re past that. Aren’t 
we?” 

The nurse bit her lip. “Well . 
yes.” 

“It’s none of his business if I 
sleep raw. And I shall, until some- 
thing more appropriate can be 
bought for me. Or — Do you sleep 
in the house? Maybe you could 
lend me a nightie. A girl-type 
nightgown.” 

“Well, yes, I sleep here. But 1 
can’t lend you a gown because, 
well — I sleep raw myself.” 
“Sensible.” 

But there are nightgowns and 
negligees and things right here. In 
your dressing room.” 

“Be damned. Who ordered 
them?” 

“I don’t know. Miss Smith. 
They were brought in and stored 
there when, well, when it became 
clear that you were going to need 
them.” 

“Good planning. Uh, do you 
know if they’re my size? Whatever 
that size is, I don’t know myself.” 
“Oh, yes! I helped measure 
you.” 

“More good planning. Find me 
the most feminine nightgown in 
there — I might as well practice.” 
“Glad to.”

T he nurse left the bedroom. 

(Butch.) (Oh, nonsense, Eu- 
nice. Sure, she’s a cute little trick 
. but 1 simply suddenly realized 
what treatment she would respond 
to. Had to dig back into my mem- 
ory; I'm out of practice.) (‘Butch’ 
1 said. You enjoyed it.) (Didn’t 
you enjoy it?) (Sure I did. She 
kis,ses like don’t-stop. But I’m not 
a hypocrite about it. Who was 
shocked when I said girls could be 
a blast? You, you dirty old hypo- 
crite. And butch.) 

(Eunice, you are out of your 
frimping mind. I’ve had most of a 
century to appreciate girls; do you 
expect me to change overnight? 
1 he time I’ll feel like a queer is the 
first time some man kisses us. I’ll 
probably faint.) (Poor Boss. 
Doesn’t know whether he’s A.C., 
or D.C. Never mind, dear, Eunice 
will coach you -as 1 do know how 
to kiss a man.) 

(I imagine you do.) (Was there 
salt in that one? Never mind, I 
know how. He faints. Boss, you 
claimed you had done everything. 
EvcM’thing?) (See here, little 
snoopy, I am not going to give 
you any excuse to call me both 
butch and pansy in the same sen- 
tence. You can have my memoirs 
later. But, Eunice, speaking of 
butch, is that what Winnie is? She 
certainly responded.) (More sweet- 
heart than ‘butch’ is my guess, 
though she may stroll both sides 
of Gay Street. But if you were 
asking is she a Lez — then 1 would 
bet anything she’s not. Ambi, sure, 
but much more interested in men. 
Haven’t you watched her? Sparks.) 

Winnie returned with a night- 
gown in each hand. “I think these 



two are the prettiest. Miss Smith. 
1 thought — ” 

“Winnie.” 

“Yes, Miss Smith?” 

“No, ‘Miss Smith.’ I mean you 
are not to call me Miss Smith. 
Not after kissing me. Or did I 
get the message wrong?” (Butch.) 
(Shut up, Eunice. She’s going to 
help us.) 

The nurse said nothing, blushed. 
Johann said gently, “That’s an- 
swer enough, dear. So call me — 
no, damn it, I don’t want you to 
call me Johann. I need a new 
name. Winnie dear, what girl’s 
name is closest to Johann?” 

“Uh, Johanna.” 

“Mmm, yes. But there is al- 
ready a Johnanna in my family. 
Got another?” 

“Well ... if you call yourself 
‘Joan’ and gave it the two syllable 
pronunciation, it would be almost 
like ‘Johann’ except for the J in- 
stead of the Y sound.” 

“Perfect! You’ve named me. I 
think that makes you my god- 
mother. Do you mind being god- 
mother to an old, old man who 
has just been reborn as a woman?” 
Winnie smiled. “I’m flattered.” 
“So call me Joan, not Miss 
Smith. Uh, I need a middle name. 
‘Eunice.’ ” (Why, Boss, now I’m 
Battered.) (Yes, beloved. Now 
shut up.) “Joan Eunice Smith. 
Winnie, do you know why that’s 
my middle name?” 

The nurse said slowly, “I’m not 
supposed to know.” 

“Then you do know. It’s for 
the sweet and gracious lady who 
gave me this wonderful body — and 
I hope she can hear me wherever 
she is.” (1 can. Boss!) “Put down 



no 



GALAXY 




those gowns and come here and 
name me with my new name. 
Name me formally for it’s all the 
christening I will ever have. Then 
seal it.” 

Almost timidly the little red- 
head came close to the bed, bent 
over her patient. She said softly, 
“I name thee ‘Joan Eunice’ ” — 
and kissed her. 

Perhaps Winnie intended to 
make it a formal peck; Joan Eu- 
nice did not let it be. Both wom- 
en were leaking tears before it 
was over. 

J OAN patted the nurse’s cheek 
and let her straighten up. 
“Thank you, dear. I’m Joan now. 
Joan Eunice. Hand me a tissue and 
you need one, too.” (How was 
that one, Eunice?) (Butch, your 
technique is improving. 1 felt that 
one clear down in our toes.) (Who 
the hell are you calling butch, 
butch? My name is Joan Eunice.) 
(No, you’re Joan and I am Eu- 
nice and collectively we’re Joan 
Eunice . and I’ve never had a 
nicer present. Boss. Joan. And I 
know you’re not a butch but you 
had better cool it with our god- 
mother. Unless you mean busi- 
ness.) 

“Which gown do you like . 
Joan?” 

“Winnie, I don’t know first 
verse about women’s clothes. 
What do you think?” 

“Well . this Cretan design is 
rather extreme. But you have the 
figure to justify it.” (No, Boss! 
Take the one with the high neck- 
line.) (Eunice, I thought you were 
proud of our bumps? They don’t 
really sag.) (It’s not that at all. 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



Trust me, Joan; I know what I’m 
doing.) 

“You may be right, Winnie. But 
it may not be the right gown for 
doctors and lawyers. I had better 
start easy, with the high neckline. 
Help me, please.” 

While they were getting Joan 
into a nightgown she asked, “Win- 
nie? How did you happen to burst 
in on me?” 

“What? Why, the displays of 
course. Both your heart rate and 
respiration were way up. Exercise. 
So I rushed in to check — and sure 
enough, my bad girl had managed 
to get out of bed. Oh, how you 
frightened me, dear!” 

“Winnie, there’s a hole in that 
story I could throw a dog 
through.” 

The nurse stiffened. “What do 
you mean — Joan?” 

“My heart rate and respiration 
must have climbed a good ten 
minutes before you came in.” 

“Oh, dear! You won’t tell on 
me? You promised.” 

“I did and so did you. Winnie 
with the sweet mouth, from now 
on neither of us is ever going to 
tell Dr. Garcia a darn thing unless 
we think he needs to know it. You 
and I, dear. Solid. Now tell me 
what happened.” 

“Uh ... oh, this is silly. Who- 
ever is on watch at the remotes 
isn’t supposed to take his eyes off 
the displays even a moment. But 
you were doing so nicely . and 
Mrs. Sloan was taking a nap — 
which she needed, poor dear — and 
Dr. Garcia had gone to check on 
Mr. Salomon . and he takes a 
grim view of being sent for unless 
the patient needs him . and the 

111 




washroom is just down the hall 
from the displays — ” 

“I get it. We had the same urge 
at the same time. Right?” 

Winnie blushed again. “I de- 
serve to be fired. I know better 
than to take any chance with a pa- 
tient. Patients do the darnedest 
things.” 

“You aren’t ever going to be 
fired, you’re going to be here long 
after Dr. Garcia leaves. If you’ll 
stay. How do I look?” 

“Simply lovely. I wouldn’t have 
guessed it but I do think this gown 
does more for you than that Cre- 
tan number.” (What did I tell you. 
Boss?) “But I’m going to put 
more lipstick on you. It’s all 
gone.” 

“Now how in the world did that 
happen?” 

Winnie giggled. “Don’t ask me. 
But guess maybe I’ll put on some 
myself before Doctor sees us. 
Joan? Is it all right for me to call 
you ‘Miss Joan’ when Dr. Garcia 
is around? He’s terribly strict.” 
“Tell him to go soak his head. 
Sho’, sho’, honey, if it makes you 
feel easier. But I’m Joan when 
he’s not around. You’re my coach. 
You’re going to make a lady out 
of me.” (That’s my job, Boss. And 
a tough one, I can see.) (So you 
need help with it. Don’t joggle 
my elbow; Winnie is our secret 
weapon.) (Okay. But this weapon 
might explode.) (Look, infant, I 
learned to cope with women long 
before your grandmother was 
born.) 

“I’d be glad to help, any way I 
can . Joan dear.” 

“Then you can start by con- 
vincing dear Doctor that I’m well 

112 



enough for a tub bath. I stink. 
Ladies ought not to stink.” 

“Why, you had a bed bath not 
two hours ago!” 

“I need more than a bed bath 
and you know it. Sell him the idea 
that you can help me into and out 
of the tub and keep me from fall- 
ing. If you have trouble with him, 
fetch him in and I’ll throw a tan- 
trum. If he gives us grief. I’ll 
make him scrub my back.” Joan 
grinned. “So get lipstick on us, 
then go find him.” 

W INNIE left the room. (Joan 
Boss honey, see what 1 mean 
about the high neckline job? See 
what it does for us?) (1 know that 
I feel somewhat more covered up. 
But only somewhat. Eunice, those 
breast panels are wicked.) (Oh, 
fuff, they’re not even transparent, 
just translucent. But that’s why 
this nightgown is so much sexier 
than the Cretan one. Men always 
mistake bare skin for sexiness. A 
typical male mistake.) (Maybe so, 
but I have never in my long life 
complained about bare skin.) (I 
won’t argue, Joan, but I’m going 
to pick out our clothes. Until you 
start thinking like a woman. But 
1 had a specific reason for picking 
the gown which is — superficially — 
more modest. So that we will have 
it on when Jake comes in.) 

(Eunice, Jake has probably gone 
home. He’s had a rough time.) 

(So he has and what do you 
think I’m talking about? He’s still 
in the house; he would not leave 
without saying good-by.) 

(Oh, nonsense, Jake and I aren’t 
that formal.) 

(Boss, Jake is a gentleman to 

GALAXY 




his fingertips. He might feel free 
to duck out without formality in 
dealing with his old friend Johann 
Smith — but not with a lady. ‘Jo- 
hann’ is one thing. ‘Joan Eunice’ 
is another matter.) 

(But he knows I’m Johann.) 

(So? Then why did he kiss our 
hand? Joan, I’m going to have to 
watch you every second; you don’t 
know anything about men.) 

(I spent almost a century being 
one.) 

(Irrelevant. Hush up; he may be 
here any time. I’ve got to tell this 
bang. Joan, the last few months 
before I was killed 1 was Jake’s 
mistress.) 

(How was the old goat?) 

(Is that all you have to say?) 

(Eunice, you think I know noth- 
ing about men. Possibly true, in 
one sense. But / can teach you 
about men — from the inside — the 
way you can teach me about men 
from the outside. Jake is tough. 
Yet I saw him collapse twice in 
grief over you. Understandable 
that your death would upset him 
some. Understandable that it was 
a strain on him to help out in the 
masquerade of not letting me 
know that I had inherited your 
lovely body. Nevertheless you 
were just a girl he had known 
through business, one who helped 
him with my affairs. Not one he 
knew intimately. Yet this tough 
old lawyer collapsed twice. Over 
you. So he must have known you 
far better than anyone guessed. 
How? And where"! Only one an- 
swer. In bed.) 

(Not always in bed, you dirty 
old man with a girl’s name. In bed, 
certainly. But lots of other places, 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



too. In his car. In your car. Sev- 
eral times in this house — ) 

(Be damned! Then all my ser- 
vants know it, too.) 

(I doubt if they suspect. We 
used your study to worx — and did 
work — and Cunningham didn’t let 
us be disturbed any more than he 
would have disturbed you and me. 
You asked a rude question, you’ll 
get a blunt answer. The old goat 
was good. And quite daring in 
grabbing every chance. We hardly 
missed a day until I was killed.) 

(A couple of j.d.’s, you two. 
Well, ‘My hat’s off to the Duke.’) 

(Jealous, Boss?) 

(No, envious. I wouldn’t have 
been up to it the first day I laid 
eyes on you. Impossible. And now 
still more impossible. Just envi- 
ous. The old goat.) 

(Not impossible, Joan.) 

(Eh?) 

(I was shocked when I saw Jake. 
My death must have hurt him ter- 
ribly. 1 know it did, he loved me. 
But we can pull him out of it, 
Joan, you and I- -only this time 
we won’t use your study.) 

( What"! Why that’s incest]) 

(Don’t be ridiculous, dear. I was 
no relation to Jake and I don’t 
think you are, either.) 

(I mean it would feel like incest. 
Jake? Jake"! Eunice, when I admit- 
ted that I supposed that I would — 
eventually — be ‘actively female’ 
I didn’t hdiV^Jake in mind.) 

(I did.) 

(Then get it out of your mind! 
Forget it. Dr. Hedrick if you want 
to -at least I’ll try to cooperate — 
after I get used to being female. 
Your former husband Joe, I owe 
that to you — ) 



113 




(Not Joe.) 

(Why not? You spoke highly of 
him in that respect, and I always 
thought you thought well of him 
in other respects. Not urging 
you — hell, I can’t think about sex 
with any man other than abstract- 
ly; I’m not yet reoriented. But I 
had already decided to go along 
with your need for Joe.) 

(Boss, I can’t. Not with Joe. Be- 
cause he was my husband. To him. 
I’d be a zombie. A walking corpse. 
1 doubt if he would touch us . 
and if he did. I’d be terribly 
tempted to tell him. Tell him I’m 
still here. Can’t. I know it.) 

(And / can’t make it with Jake. 
It’s the same with Jake, too, you 
know. A walking corpse.) 

(Not quite the same. Surely, he 
knows we’re a patchwork, your 
brain and my body. But he loved 
us both. He’s loved you much 
longer that he’s loved me. While 
Joe doesn’t even know you.) 

{Jake loved me? Eunice, you’re 
out of your mind!) 

(Impossible, dear; 1 don’t have 
one to be out of. Why do you 
think Jake put up with your bad 
temper? Not for money; he’s rich, 
even though he’s not as rich as you 
are. Why is he still around at all? 
For me? He would have avoided 
seeing me — this body — had it been 
possible; it hurts him. He stuck be- 
cause you needed him. Look, dear 
— Joan, 1 mean — Joan, this is your 
big sister Eunice talking, you 
listen to her. Be nice to Jake. Be a 
sweet girl to Jake. Then let things 
run easy. I’m not asking you to do 
anything you don’t want to do — 
heavens, no! Jake would spot it if 
you forced yourself; he’s no fool 

114 



about women. Just be sweet. Don’t 
be Johann, be Joan. Be little and 
feminine and let him take care of 
you.) 

(Well — I’ll try. Jake is going to 
think I’m off my rocker.) 

(He’s going to think you’re a 
darling girl. It’s possible he’d rath- 
er be your father than what he was 
to me. If so, we’ll be good and let 
him baby us.) 

She sighed. (I’ll try, Eunice. 
But I don’t know. Jake!) 

(That’s my good girl, Joan. Be 
helpless and female; Jake will do 
the rest.) 

D r. GARCIA bustled in, came 
straight to the bed. “What’s this 
about a tub bath? I thought I 
made it plain that you weren’t to 
rush things.’’ 

(Don’t let him argue, Joan!) 
(Watch me trip him!) “Oh! Doc- 
tor, you startled me so!’’ 

“Eh? How?” 

“Bursting in on me without 
warning. Is that nice?” 

Garcia looked baffled. “Miss 
Smith, I’ve been here more than a 
year and I’ve always entered this 
room without ceremony. Am I to 
understand that you find it offen- 
sive? After all this time?” 

“That’s not the point. Doctor. 
When you first came here you 
were attending a helpless old man. 
Then you were helping Dr. Hed- 
rick with a female patient who was 
paralyzed, and unconscious most 
of the time — and I do appreciate 
the care you gave that helpless pa- 
tient, for I am she. But things 
change. I am now having to learn 
to be a woman and, if possible, a 
lady. It’s not easy. Won’t you 

GALAXY 




help me by showing me the formal 
courtesies you show other ladies?” 

Garcia reddened slightly. “A 
doctor doesn’t have time for for- 
malities.” 

(Slug him again, dearie! He’s 
still twitching.) (I shall!) “Doctor, 
if I were in danger, I would expect 
you to rush in without buzzing; I 
depend on you. But you came in 
to tell me 1 can’t have a bath — 
surely not an emergency. I’m not 
asking much — ^just asking you to 
think of this room, not as an old 
man’s sickroom, but as a lady’s 
boudoir. To help me. Please?” 

Dr. Garcia said stiffly, “Very 
well. Miss Smith. I shall remem- 
ber.” 

“Thank you, sir. By the way, 
my name is Joan Smith now; I 
can’t go on being Johann. You 
might call me ’Miss Joan’ to help 
me get used to it. Or simply Joan, 
as I don’t want to be unnecessarily 
formal with my doctor, truly I 
don’t. Just that little touch of for- 
mality that I need as training in 
learning how to be my new self. 
Will you call me Joan?” 

He grudged a smile. “All 
right — Joan.” 

She gave him Eunice’s best you- 
wonderful-man smile. “That 
sounds nice. And you are welcome 
anytime. Doctor, either profes- 
sionally or just to visit. Which I 
hope you will do. Just have the 
nurse make sure I’m ready to re- 
ceive a gentleman. Things. You 
know.” She raised herself on an 
elbow and looked at him, acutely 
aware of her “modest” nightgown. 
“Such as lipstick.” She wetted her 
lips. “Odd to have to wear it. Is it 
on properly? Does it look right?” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“You look lovely!” 

(Cancel and erase — change 
‘butch’ to ‘tart.’ You’re a natural- 
born tart, dearie. Where’s your 
beat?) (Stow it, sister tart; I 
haven’t finished hustling him.) 
“Why, thank you, sir! Now tell 
me why I can’t have a hot, soapy, 
tub bath so that 1 will feel lovely, 
too. I’ll follow your orders. Doc- 
tor, but 1 would like to understand 
them. Can you tell me without 
using a lot of long medical 
words?” 

“Well — Joan, my objection is 
to the tub itself. People are for- 
ever breaking legs or cracking 
skulls through slipping in bathtubs. 
And you haven’t even learned to 
stand up, much less walk.” 

“True.” Joan threw the sheet 
back, dropped her feet over the 
edge of the bed, sat up — controlled 
a slight dizziness and smiled. 
“Let’s see if I can. Will you help 
me. Doctor? Arm around me per- 
haps?” 

“Lie down!” 

“Must I? I feel fine. Is there a 
stool? My feet don’t touch — ” 
“Miss Sm — Joan, damn it, so 
help me I’m going to quit this 
business and buy a junk yard! Lie 
down while I call a nurse. Then 
we’ll get on each side of you and 
let you stand up. When you find 
out how weak and dizzy you are. 
I’ll expect you to go back to bed 
and stay there.” 

“Yes, Doctor,” she said meekly 
and lay down. 

Winnie answered the summons. 
“You rang. Doctor?” 

“We’re going to try a practice 
walk. Help me get the patient up. 
You take her left side.” 



115 




“Yes, sir.” 

With too much help Joan got 
out of bed, stood up. The room 
wobbled a little but she steadied 
herself on Winnie while letting her 
arm be feather-light on the doc- 
tor’s shoulder. 

“How do you feel?” 

“Fine. We should have music; I 
feel like dancing.” 

“Feel like it if you wish, don’t 
try it. Slow march now and short 
steps.” They walked toward the 
door, while Joan relished the thick 
pile of the rug against her bare 
feet. Walking was fun, everything 
was fun! (Eunice my love, do you 
realize what a perfect body this 
is?) (It’s way out of shape. But 
two weeks hard work and we’ll 
have it tuned up.) (Oh, pooh, I 
never felt this good even as a 
child.) (You’ll see. Boss. Say a 
vertical split with our hair sweep- 
ing the floor, then hold it through 
ten controlled breaths — and come 
out of it with a slow walkover and 
melt on down into a full lotus with 
never a hurried movement. Just 
wait.) (You think we’ll be able to 
do that? I was clumsy even as a 
boy.) (No huhu. The body re- 
members, dear.) 

They stopped. “Now turn 
around slowly, and head for your 
bed.” 

“Doctor? Now that I’m up, why 
not head me straight for that soap 
and water?” 

“Aren’t you tired?” 

“Not a bit. I didn’t lean on you, 
did I? I thought I had been prom- 
ised a real bath as soon as I was 
able to walk. Must I stand on my 
hands as well? Back away and I’ll 
try.” She let go his arm. 



The doctor promptly put his 
arm around her waist. “No non- 
sense! Nurse, that tub has grab 
rails; make her use them.” 

“Yes, Doctor.” 

“If this patient falls, you had 
better head for Canada — you can 
find the shortest route by follow- 
ing me. If you’re fast enough.” 
“Winnie won’t let me fall, ” 
Joan said warmly while warmly 
leaning into his arm. “But if 
you’re worried, you can come in 
and help. Scrub my back.” 

He snorted. “Ten minutes ago 
you bawled me out merely for 
walking into your bedroom unan- 
nounced.” 

“And if you do it again, I shall 
again. That’s social; this is profes- 
sional. Doctor, I’m well aware 
that you’ve seen my new body — 
professionally — many times. One 
more time won’t kill me.” She 
wiggled slightly in his arm. 

“Scrubbing a patient’s back is 
not part of my professional dut- 
ies. Lukewarm tub. Nurse, and 
don’t let her stay in too long.” 

O NCE inside the bathroom and 
the door shut Joan threw her 
arms around her nurse and gig- 
gled. “Honey, did you see his 
face?” 

Winnie shook her head. “Joan, 
you don’t need me to coach you in 
how to be female. You already 
know.” 

“Oh, but I do need you, dear. 
Because I don’t know. I simply 
used on dear Doctor things that 
used to fluster me when I was his 
age — and male.” She giggled 
again. “For a second I thought he 
was going to take my dare and 



116 



GALAXY 



scrub my back.” (And / thought 
you were going to lay him, right 
on the rug.) (Oh, be quiet, Eunice; 
I didn’t even pinch him.) Joan let 
go of Winnie, stepped back and 
started to skin the gown over her 
head. “Now for a bath. Oh, boy!” 
“Joan! Please hold on to some- 
thing. Doetor might show up any 
seeond.” 

“Oh, pooh, he wouldn’t dare. 
Never again.” Joan turned and 
touched the latch switch. “Now he 
can’t, so quit fretting.” 

“You mustn’t lock the door. 
Hospital baths are never locked.” 
“This isn’t a hospital and I’ll 
lock my bathroom door whenever 
1 like and if Dr. Garcia finds out 
I’ve locked it the only way he 
can — by trying to walk in — and 
dares to mention it. I’ll scream my 
head off to Jake Salomon and 
there’ll be a ehange in doctors. 
Winnie dear, I wasn’t a cranky old 
man more years than I care to 
think about without learning how 
to get my own way. I just have to 
use different weapons now. Want 
to peel off that uniform and hang 
it in the dressing room? I not only 
may splash you but this end is go- 
ing to fill up with steam.” 

“No, Joan — lukewarm tub. 
You heard him.” 

“I heard him and it’s going to 
be the temperature I like and 
that’s another thing he’ll never 
know and you know that I’m live- 
ly as a frog and not the weak kit- 
ten he insists on thinking I am; a 
hot tub won’t hurt me. If you want 
to get your uniform clammy, 
that’s your business. Better yet, 
climb into the tub with me. It’s 
big and, short as I am now, 1 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



might slide under and drown, 
alone.” 

“I shouldn’t,” Winnie said slow- 
ly- 

“Isn’t that a horrid thought? 
Patient faints in tub and drowns 
before nurse can reach her. Not 
good enough for flash news but 
they might mention it on the late- 
late-late early news.” 

“Joan! You’re teasing me.” 
(You sure are, Boss. Erase and 
correct again — Both tart and 
butch.) (Fiddlesticks, Eunice. 
That’s a big enough tub for all 
three of us.) 

Winnie bit her lip and slowly 
unfastened her smock. Joan turned 
away and started filling the tub, 
adjusted the temperature and 
avoided watehing her. 

A n hour later Joan was seated 
in an easy chair, her feet on a 
stool. To the nightgown had been 
added a filmy negligee and a pair 
of high-heeled boudoir pumps. 
Her hair had been arranged, her 
face had been most carefully made 
up and she was lavishly scented 
with a eologne labeled “April 
Mist” but whieh deserved the title 
of “Criminal Assault.” Her toe 
nails were trimmed, not to Eu- 
nice’s satisfaction but well enough 
for the time being. Best of all, she 
was enjoying the euphoria of a 
woman who is utterly clean, 
seented and powdered, and dressed 
attractively. 

Beds had been switched; the 
room no longer held any flavor of 
siekroom, and Joan found that this 
greatly inereased her feeling of 
wellbeing. Eunice’s stenodesk had 
been restored to its usual spot be- 

117 




yond Johann’s baby grand piano, 
Joan having learned that it was in 
her study where it had last been 
used, and had told Cunningham to 
have it brought in. It did not fit the 
room -but it fitted her notion of 
what the room should be; it was 
homey, it belonged. 

She was alone, Winnie having 
gone to invite Mr. Salomon to 
dine with his hostess-ward. Joan 
sighed with satisfaction. (Feel bet- 
ter, hon? I do.) (Heavens, yes. But 
why did you lose your nerve?) (Oh, 
piffle, Eunice! 1 never intended to 
seduce her.) (Liar. Hypocrite. 
Dirty old man. You had her all 
set. Then you went chicken. I’ve 
met men like you before, dearie — 
talk a good game, then lose their 
nerve in the clutch. Cowardly Cas- 
anovas. Pfui!) 

(Nonsense! You don’t shoot 
ducks on water. If I ever make a 
real pass at her — I’m not saying I 
will but I admit she’s a cuddle- 
some little bundle — ) (She is in- 
deed!) (Oh, shut up! If I ever do. 
I’ll give her a sporting chance — 
not grab her when she dasn’t 
scream.) (‘Sporting chance’ my 
tired back. Listen to your big sis- 
ter, Joan — sex isn’t a sport, it’s a 
way to be happy. There is nothing 
more exasperating to a woman 
than to be ready to give in — then 
have the matter dropped. You’ll 
find out. You’ll cry in your pillow 
and hate every man alive. Till the 
next time, that is.) 

(Eunice? You’ve never had that 
sort of turn-down, have you? I 
don’t believe it.) (Happens to 
every woman, Joan. Men are sisr 
sies. If we women weren’t so will- 
ing, if we didn’t just plain lead ’em 

118 



by the hand, the race would die 
out.) 

(Uh — You know more about 
being a woman than I do — ) (Lots 
more!) ( — so let’s talk about spec- 
ifics. We’re clean now and I know 
we’re pretty; I checked us in the 
big glass and you agreed. But it 
isn’t the job you used to turn out. 
I don’t mean body paint, wouldn’t 
be appropriate now anyhow. But 
what does it take? Just that tuning 
up? Exercise?) 

(More than that. Boss — al- 
though exercise is essential. 
You’re talking about a profession- 
al }ob?) (Yes. The works.) (Well, 
I used to do myself- but 1 had 
had lots of practice, plus expert 
help from Joe. But let’s say you 
want the best and don’t care what 
it costs — ) (Certainly! What’s 
money? I can’t get rid of it.) (All 
right, say you retain Helena Rub- 
instein, Limited, or some other 
top glamor shop. Say you phone 
and tell them to send a full team. 
They would send an art director — 
male, but he may not be ^11 that 
male and he’s seen more female 
bodies unmade-up than an under- 
taker — and he doesn’t touch you; 
he’s too high up. He creates. And 
bosses. Won’t look at you until 
several others get you ready. 
Mmm, bath girl, masseuse, mani- 
curist, pedicurist, coiffeuse, depila- 
trix, parfumiste, face and skin 
team of at least four, costume de- 
signer, highlight and accent spe- 
cialist, and assistants for all of 
these if you expect the job done in 
less than all day. If you put a time 
limit on it, the price goes up — and 
if you don’t , the price goes up.) 

(Say that again?) 



GALAXY 




(It’s like taxes. Any way you 
play it the price goes up. Boss, we 
don’t need them. With what I 
know and the chassis we have to 
work with and a good lady’s maid, 
you can be as glamorous as you 
like. 1 don’t know where you 
would find a creative paint man 
equal to Joe; nevertheless there 
are good ones for hire. We can 
shop the market, we’ll find one.) 

(Eunice, 1 had no idea that being 
a woman was so complicated.) 

(Relax, Boss. Being a woman is 
easier than being a man — and lots 
more fun. I’m going to teach you 
to be a twenty-first century wo- 
man — and I’d be pleased if you 
would teach me how it was to be a 
twentieth century man, and we’ll 
close that silly ‘generation gap.’ 
Understand each other as well as 
loving each other.) 

(Beloved.) 

(I think you’re pretty nice, too, 
you cranky old bastard. With 
your brain and my body, we make 
a fine team. We’ll get by.) (I’m 
sure we will, darling.) (We will. 
The first thing we need is a good 
lady’s maid — scarce as whales in 
Kansas. We’ll probably have to 
train one. Then lose her as soon 
as she’s worth anything.) (Eunice, 
do we need a maid? You used to 
do yourself.) (1 did, and kept 
house for Joe, and was your sec- 
retary and worked any hours you 
wanted me. But you’re not used to 
that, Boss. You had a valet.) (Yes, 
of course. But I was very old and 
didn’t have time to waste on such 
things. Eunice, one of the worst 
parts about getting old is that the 
days get shorter while the demands 
on your time increase. 1 didn't 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



want a valet; I was forced into it. 
Didn’t enjoy being dependent on a 
secretary, either — until you came 
along.) 

(Dear Boss. Joan, we will need 
a maid. But not a secretary until 
you’re active in business again — ) 
(Won’t be!) (We’ll see. You may 
have to be. But may not need a 
secretary unless you get pushed 
for time. I can handle it. And 
thanks for having Betsy brought 
in; it makes me feel at home to 
see her again. My stenodesk, I 
mean. Pet name.) 

(‘Betsy’ huh? I always thought 
of it as ’the Octopus.’) 

(Why, what a nasty name to ap- 
ply to a nice, respectable, well- 
behaved machine! Boss, I’m not 
sure I’m speaking to you. I’m 
glad Betsy isn’t switched on; if she 
had heard that, her feelings would 
be hurt.) 

(Eunice, don’t be silly. I wonder 
what’s keeping Jake?) 

(Probably cutting his toenails. 
Lesson number two in how to be 
a woman: Men are almost always 
late but you never, never, never 
notice it — because they pride 
themselves on promptness. Boss, 
you didn’t quite promise Winnie 
to stay in this chair — when she 
gave you strict orders.) (Of course 
not. Because it might not suit me. 
And it doesn’t; I want to try the 
eighty-eight. Eunice, two gets you 
seven it hasn’t been kept in tune — 
and I gave Cunningham orders 
about both pianos, this baby and 
the concert grand downstairs, not 
five years ago. So let’s see.) 

S HE stood up, did not notice that 
high heels gave her no trouble, 

119 




and glided gracefully over to the 
little piano, sat down and opened 
it — let the first bars of Dvorak’s 
Slavonic Dance ^10 run through 
her mind, then started to play — 

— and achieved a clash of noise. 

“What the hell!” She looked at 
the keyboard, then hit middle C 
with her right forefinger. It 
sounded okay — and so did the C 
an octave below it. Several one- 
and two-finger experiments con- 
vinced her that the piano was not 
at fault. Yet to strike a single 
chord required studying the key- 
board, then carefully positioning 
each finger by sight. 

Presently she managed a slow, 
uneven, faulty version of “Chop- 
sticks” by watching the keyboard 
and controlling her hands so hard 
they trembled. She quit before 
reaching its undistinguished coda 
and crashed the keys with both 
hands. (There go ten years of 
piano lessons!) (What did you ex- 
pect, Boss? I was never much good 
even with a guitar.) (Well, I’m 
glad Mama didn’t hear that — she 
always wanted me to be a concert 
pianist. Eunice, why the devil 
didn’t you study piano as a kid?) 
(Because I was too busy studying 
boys! A much more rewarding 
subject. Joan, if you want to play 
the piano again, we can learn. But 
we’ll have to start almost from 
scratch. It’s in your head, I know; 
I could hear it. But to get from 
there down into our hands — my 
hands, dear — will probably take 
more patient work than slimming 
our hips.) 

(Doesn’t matter, not really.) 
She got up from the piano bench. 
(Boss. Just a sec. While we’re 

120 



here, let’s warm up Betsy and give 
her a check run.) (Huh? I know 
nothing about a stenodesk. It’ll be 
worse than the piano.) (We’ll see.) 

She moved over and sat down 
at the stenodesk. (Well, Eunice? 
Which way to the Egress?) (Relax, 
Boss. The body remembers. Just 
say ’Dictation, Eunice,’ then re- 
cite something you know. Think 
about what you’re dictating.) 

(Okay.) “Dictation, Eunice. 
‘Four score and seven years ago 
our fathers brought forth on this 
continent a new nation, conceived 
in liberty, and dedicated to the 
proposition. .” 

Deftly her hands touched the 
switches, swiveled the microphone 
in time to catch the first word, re- 
quired the machine to listen & 
hold while she inserted punctua- 
tion, used erase & correct when 
the machine spelled “fourth” rath- 
er than “forth” — all without hur- 
rying. 

She stopped and looked at the 
result. (Be durned! How, Eunice?) 
(Don’t ask, dear — or we might get 
fouled up in the dilemma of the 
centipede. But Betsy is purring like 
a kitten; she’s glad I’m back.) 
(Well, so am I. Uh, Eunice, this 
machine — Betsy, I mean has ac- 
cess to the Congressional Library 
St. Louis Annex, does it not? — 
she not?) (Certainly. Hooked into 
the Interlibrary Net, rather, 
though you can restrict a query to 
one library.) 

(Better query just one. I want to 
find out what is known about 
memory and how it works.) (All 
right. I’m interested, too; I think 
my memory is spotty. Can’t be 
sure. But on a search-of-literature 

GALAXY 



it’s best to let Betsy handle it 
through preprograms — ask for 
references, followed by abstracts, 
followed by items selected from 
abstracts . else, on a generalized 
question like that, thousands of 
books would be transmitted and 
poor Betsy would gulp them down 
until she was constipated, and stop 
and not do anything until her tem- 
porary memory was erased.) 

(You know how, I don’t. Uh, 
stick in a restriction not to bother 
with behaviorist theories. I know 
all about Pavlov and his robots I 
care to know, namely that every 
time a dog salivates a behaviorist 
psychologist has to ring a bell.) 

(All right. Boss? Can we spend 
a little more money?) (Go ahead, 
buy the Pyramids. What do you 
want, dearest?) (Let’s have a Tri- 
ple-A-One snoop search run on 
me. Eunice Branca, I mean — the 
‘me’ that used to be.) (Why, be- 
loved? If you’ve been selling gov- 
ernment secrets they can’t touch 
you now.) (Because. It might fill 
some of those holes I think I have 
in my memory . and it might 
turn up something you’ve heard 
from me since I came back but 
which was not in the security re- 
port you got on me originally. 
Then you would know, dear . 
and could stop worrying that I 
may be only a figment of your 
imagination.) 

(Eunice, if I’m crazy, the only 
thing that worries me is that some 
damned shrink might cure me. 
Then you would go away.) 

(That’s sweet of you. Boss. 
But I won’t go away; I promised.) 

(And even if I am crazy, it just 
makes me fit that much better into 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



the present world. Eunice, don’t 
you remember anything between 
being killed and waking up here?) 

T he inner voice was silent a 
moment. (Not really. There 
were dreams and I think you were 
in them. But there was one that 
does not seem like a dream; it 
seems as real as this room. But if 
I tell you, you’ll think / am crazy.) 
(If so, it doesn’t detract from 
your charm, dear.) (All right but 
don’t laugh. Joan, while I was 
away, I was in this — place. There 
was an old, old Man with a long 
white beard. He had a great big 
book. He looked at it, then He 
looked at me and said, ’Daughter, 
you’ve been a naughty girl. But 
not too naughty, so I’m going to 
give you a second chance.’) 

(A dream, Eunice. Anthropo- 
morphism, straight out of your 
childhood Sunday School.) (May- 
be, Boss. But here I am and I do 
have a second chance.) 

(Yes, but God didn’t give it to 
you. Eunice my own, I don’t be- 
lieve in God nor Devil.) 

(Well . you haven’t been dead 
— and / have. Truly I don’t know 
what I believe; I guess I wasn’t 
dead long enough to find out. But 
do you mind if we pray occasion- 
ally?) 

(Jesus H. Christ!) 

(Stop that, Joan! Or I’ll use 
every one of those words you con- 
sider ‘unladylike’. It’s not much to 
ask.) 

(I’m henpecked. Okay. If it’s a 
beautiful church, with good music, 
and the sermon isn’t over ten min- 
utes.) (Oh, I didn’t mean in a 
church. Can’t stand ’em. Filled 

121 




with bad vibrations. I mean pray 
by ourselves, Joan. I’ll teach you.) 

(Oh. All right. Now?) 

(No, I want to get these search 
orders in. You think about some- 
thing else; I don’t want centipede 
trouble — think about Winnie all 
slickery with soapsuds.) (A pious 
thought. Much better than prayer.) 
(Dirty old man. How do you 
know — I’ll bet you’ve never prayed 
in your life.) (Oh, yes, I have, 
dearest — but God had gone fish- 
ing.) (So think about Winnie.) 

She was busy for several minu- 
tes. Then she patted the machine 
affectionately and switched it off. 
(Well, did you?) (Did I what?) 
(Did you think about Winnie? 
Lecher.) (I took advantage of the 
unusual peace and quiet to con- 
template the wonders of the uni- 
verse.) (So?) (I thought about 
Winnie.) (I know you did; 1 was 
right with you. Joan, for a girl 
who is, in one sense at least, a vir- 
gin, you have an unusually low 
and vivid imagination.) (Aw, 
shucks. I’ll bet you say that to all 
the girls.) (The stark truth, Joan 
sweet — with your imagination I 
can hardly wait for you to start us 
on that ‘actively female’ career. 
In all the wrestling I’ve done I’ve 
never had a man — or a girl — grab 
me the way you were thinking 
about.) (Oh. Learned that one 
from a respectable housewife, 
clear back in my teens. A most 
charming lady.) (Hmm! Perhaps I 
was born too late for the real ac- 
tion.) (So I’ve been trying to tell 
you. Did you get those orders in?) 
(Certainly, Boss, when did I ever 
miss? Let’s get back to our chair; 
our back is tired.) 

122 



J OAN EUNICE negotiated the 
thirty feet back to her chair 
without remembering that she had 
kicked off her pumps to handle the 
lower controls of the stenodesk 
more easily; the rug simply felt 
good to her bare feet. Then she did 
notice as she sat down in the big 
easy chair and folded her legs in 
the awkward, elegant, and surpris- 
ingly comfortable lotus position. 
But it did not seem worth while to 
go get them. 

The door buzzer sounded. “It’s 
me, Winnie.” 

“Come in. dear.” 

The nurse entered. “Mr. Salo- 
mon asked me to tell you that he 
will be in to see you in a few min- 
utes. But he can’t stay for dinner.” 
“He’ll stay. Come here and kiss 
me. What did you tell Cunning- 
ham?” 

“Dinner for two, in here, just as 
you said — to be served when you 
rang. But Mr. Salomon seemed 
quite firm about leaving.” 

“I still say he’ll stay. But if he 
doesn’t, you come eat dinner with 
me. Would you fetch my pumps? 
Over there on the floor beyond the 
piano.” 

The nurse looked, fetched the 
pumps, stood over Joan Eunice 
and sighed. “Joan, I don’t know 
what to do about you. You’ve 
been a bad girl again. Why didn’t 
you ring?” 

“Don’t scold me, dear. Here, 
sit on the stool and lean against 
my knees and talk. There. Now 
tell me — By any chance were you 
ever a lady’s maid before you took 
nurse’s training?” 

“No. Why?” 

“You did such a fine job of tak- 

GALAXY 




ing care of me in the bath and get- 
ting me pretty. Well, it was just a 
thought. I don’t suppose a nurse — 
a professional woman — would 
consider a job as a maid. No mat- 
ter how high the salary. But Dr. 
Garcia is going to insist that I 
have a nurse after he leaves. I 
don’t need a nurse and you know 
it. But dear Doctor will insist. I do 
need a maid; I won’t be able to 
dress myself at first — women’s 
clothes are so different. Not to 
mention knowing nothing about 
makeup. Or buying women’s 
clothes. What are you paid now, 
Winnie?” 

The nurse told her. 

“Goodness! No wonder they’re 
always saying there’s a shortage of 
nurses. I can’t hire an in-house 
guard at that price. What would 
you think of staying on as my 
nurse — but actually doing things 
for me that a maid would do and 1 
don’t know how to do — at three 
times your present salary? With 
whatever you wish paid in cash so 
that you won’t have to report it?” 

The redhead looked thoughtful. 
“How would you want me to 
dress, Joan?” 

“That’s up to you. Your white 
nurse’s uniform, if you prefer it — 
since you’ll be my nurse in Dr. 
Garcia’s eyes. Or what you wish. 
There’s a bedroom through that 
door where my valet used to sleep. 
With a nice bath — and another 
room beyond it which we can redo 
as your living room. Redecorate 
all three rooms to suit your taste. 
Your private apartment.” 

(Boss, what was that about not 
shooting ducks on water?) (Stuff 
it, Eunice. If she takes the bait, it’s 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



better than hiring some illit and 
having to train her — and then have 
her steal the jewelry and drop out 
about the time she’s some use). 
(Oh, I see advantages. But you 
plaee Winnie one unlocked door 
away and she’ll be in bed with you 
before you ean say ‘Sappho.’ You 
may not want men in our life — but 
/ do.) (Oh, nonsense! She’s already 
thinking about the money. If she 
takes the job, she’ll be more stand- 
offish — she’ll start calling us 
‘Miss’ again.) 

“Miss Joan? It’ll really be my 
own apartment? I ean entertain?” 

“Of course, dear. Private. Oh, 
Cunningham’s staff will clean and 
so forth, any service you want. 
Breakfast tray, whatever. Or never 
enter it if you prefer it that way.” 

“It sounds heavenly. I’m shar- 
ing a room with two other girls. 
at a rent that’s horrid beeause it’s 
inside an enclave. Safe — but I 
never have any privacy." 

“Winnie. Look at me, dear, and 
lay it on the line. The bed in there 
now is, I believe, a single. Would 
you like to have it replaced with a 
big, big double bed?” 

The girl blushed. “Uh, it would 
be nice.” 

“So stop blushing. 1 won’t know 
you have a visitor unless you tell 
me; that door is soundproof. Of 
course visitors have to be identi- 
fied and checked for weapons, just 
as visitors to an enclave have to be 
— but that simply means you must 
vouch for a visitor to my chief 
guard the first visit. But I won’t 
know it unless you choose to tell 
me. The in-house staff all have vis- 
itors. But security is my chief 
guard’s worry, not mine.”

“But he does have to show his 
ID?” 

“You still would have to vouch 
for him to Chief O’Neil but — 
Hold the count down. Did you 
mean he would rather not show an 
ID? Is he married, or something?” 

Winnie blushed again, did not 
answer. Joan Eunice went on, 
“Nobody’s business, dear. This is 
a private home, not a government 
compound. You vouch for him, 
that’s enough. Chief O’Neil 
doesn’t trust IDs; they’re often 
faked. But he has a photographic 
eye. Are you going to stay with 
me? As nurse in residence, or 
lady’s companion, or social secre- 
tary, or whatever you want?” 

“Lady’s maid. If I’m to be your 
maid. Miss Joan, I’d rather that 
your staff knew it and no pretense. 
And dress as your maid. What 
sort of uniform? Traditional? Or 
Acapulco? Or something in be- 
tween?” 

“Oh, not traditional, surely; you 
have such pretty legs. All-out Aca- 
pulco, if you like.” 

Winnie looked pleased. “I might 
go all out. A girl gets tired of 
these white coveralls.” (Joan! Tell 
her not to use an all-out Acapulco 
paint job. Bad for her skin.) 

“Suit yourself, dear. But don’t 
use a lot of paint. Bad for your 
skin.” 

“Oh, I know! I’m a real red- 
head, you probably noticed. I can’t 
even sunbathe. I was thinking of a 
little black frill skirt with a white 
lace apron about the size of a sau- 
cer. Little perky maid’s cap, white 
on a black ribbon. Cling-On cups, 
in black. Transparent? Or opa- 
que?” 

124 



“Whichever suits you, Winnie. 
High heels?” 

“Uh, translucent, I guess, like 
the panels in that nightie. High 
heels, certainly, or the effect is lost 
— I can wear real stilts if I’m bare- 
footed most of the time. Then just 
enough paint for accent. There are 
lovely decals that go on in no time 
and come right off with cold 
cream. Butterflies and flowers and 
things. Cheap, too. Everything I 
mentioned I can buy in disposa- 
bles. I’ll look like a proper lady’s 
maid, yet not spend more time get- 
ting dressed than I do in putting 
on this smock and tights.” 

“You’ll look cute, dear. Going 
to dress up in a maid’s outfit and 
model it for your friend?” 

Winnie started to blush again, 
then grinned. “I certainly am! And 
let him take it off me, too!” 
(Cheers!) (Eunice, you have a one- 
track mind.) (You should know, 
dearie — it’s your mind.) 

A LEW moments later Winnie 
announced Mr. Salomon, then 
left. The lawyer came toward Joan 
solemnly, took the hand she ex- 
tended and bowed over it. “How 
are you feeling?” he asked. 

“Disappointed,” Joan answered 
soberly. “Because my oldest and 
dearest friend hasn’t time to dine 
with me my first day up. But phys- 
ically I feel fine. Weak, but that’s 
to be expected.” 

“Sure you’re not overdoing?” 
“I’m sure. My respiration and 
heartbeat are being telemetered — 
if I weren’t all right, someone 
would come in and order me to 
bed. Truly, I’m all right, Jake — 
and I won’t get strong unless I do 

GALAXY 




stay out of bed. But how about 
you, old friend? I have been terri- 
bly worried.” 

“Oh, I’m all right. Just made a 
fool of myself, Johann.” 

“You did not make a fool of 
yourself ... and I feel certain 
Eunice knows it, Jake.” (Watch it. 
Boss!) (Pipe down.) “You could 
have paid her no finer tribute than 
those honest tears.” Joan found 
her own tears starting; she encour- 
aged them while ignoring them. 
“She was a sweet and gallant lady, 
Jake, and it touched me more than 
I can say to learn that you appre- 
ciated her wonderful qualities as 
much as I did. Jake — please sit 
down, if only for a moment. There 
is something I must ask you.” 

“Well ... all right. Can’t stay 
long.” 

“Whistle that chair closer and 
face me. Uh, a glass of sherry? 
Doctor says I may have it — and I 
find that I need it. That Spanish 
cocktail sherry, dry as your wit. 
Will you do me the honor of pour- 
ing for us?” 

Joan waited until the lawyer had 
filled their glasses and had seated 
himself. She raised her glass and 
at the same time raised her chest, 
letting those “wicked” panels do 
their best. “A toast, Jake — no, 
don’t get up. The same toast, Jake 
- always the same toast from now 
on whenever you and 1 drink to- 
gether . but silently.” She took 
a sip and put her glass down. 
“Jake — ” 

“Yes . Johann?” 

“ ‘Joan’ please — I can’t be ‘Jo- 
hann’ any longer. Jake, you know 
that I never expected to live 
through any such operation? It 



was a — device. A legal device.” 
“Yes, Joha — Yes, Joan, I 
knew. That’s why I helped.” 

“I knew. The most generous act 
of friendship I have ever known. 
What is it the Japanese name it? — 
the friend who helps, when it is 
necessary to die. Never mind. 
Jake, look me in the eye. Do you 
know, deep in your heart, that I 
would rather be dead . than to 
have lived through it by this in- 
credible circumstance? Be alive . 
at her expense? Do you know that, 
Jake? Or must I live still another 
life, hating myself?” 

Salomon raised his eyes, met 
hers firmly. “Yes — Joan. I know 
it. It was no fault of yours . you 
must not hate yourself. Uh . Eu- 
nice wouldn't want you to!” 

“I know! Weep, dear Jake; 
don’t hold back your tears — see, 
I am not holding back mine. Just 
try not to go to pieces, or I will, 
too. Jake, each of us would hap- 
pily have died rather than let this 
happen. I am as certain of it about 
you as 1 hope you are about me. 
I don’t think I could stand it if you 
had not reassured me. Look at me 
— a lovely body and young — yet I 
am almost ninety-five years old 
and have not one friend left alive 
. but you.” 

“You’ll make more friends.” 
“I wonder if I can. The span is 
great, perhaps too great. I feel as 
the Wandering Jew must have felt, 
alive beyond his allotted time. His 
name — Aha — something. My 

memory is not as good as this 
young body. But I can’t forget one 
question which I must ask. Jake, 
is there any possibility that Eu- 
nice’s husband had something to 



I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



125 




do with her death? That prize I put 
up, that blood money — did it 
tempt himT’ 

(B OSS, Boss, you’re way off 
base. I know!) (Sorry, beloved, 
more sorry than I can say. But I 
must have proof.) “Jake? Did I en- 
tice a murder!” 

T he lawyer shook his head. “I’m 
astounded. But of course you 
don’t know the circumstances. 
You enticed nothing. I wrote that 
offer most carefully. Were there 
any guilt I would share it. There 
was none.” 

“How do you know!” (Drop it. 
Boss. Please!) 

“Mr. Branca was in Philadel- 
phia, visiting his mother.” (You 
see. Boss?) “I had to find him to 
get the post-death ratification. 
Took three days, while both of 
you were kept ready for surgery. 
Joe Branca didn’t know she was 
dead. Hell of a job even to find 
him. Three long days.” 

“Three days. Why wasn’t I 
told?” 

“And waste Eunice’s death? Are 
you crazy? You were unconscious; 
Garcia put you under as soon as I 
notified him that a body was going 
to be ready. Then that dreadful 
wait. I need your forgiveness, too, 
for — Joan — no, ‘Johann!’ 1 hated 
you ... for being alive when she 
was dead. But I pushed on — for 
her sake. Oh, I got over it, it was 
a sick hate. I knew better.” 

“Do you hate me now?” 

“Eh?” Salomon looked at her, 
in sorrow. “No. You are not only 
my old friend, who has always 
been honest and decent under his 
crusty exterior — whose virtues 



outweighed his faults.” Salomon 
managed to smile. “Though some- 
times just barely. But also you are 
the only tie 1 have left to her.” 

“Yes. You may find me better 
tempered now, Jake. It’s easier to 
smile, easier to be patient, than it 
was in that old wreck of a body I 
had. But, Jake, about Joe Branca. 
All right, he was in Philadelphia. 
But could he have arranged it?” 

“No.” 

“You’re certain?” 

“Certain. Joha — Joan, it’s that 
million dollars that worries you, 
fear that it might have started a 
chain of events. When they located 
Joe Branca, I had to jet there and 
get that piece of paper. He was 
dazed. Couldn’t believe it. But ac- 
cepted the fact. But not the 
money. I couldn’t get him to sign 
the post-death authorization with- 
out first preparing another docu- 
ment, waiving the money. The 
escrow trustee — Chase Manhattan 
— was instructed by Joe to pay it 
to the Rare Blood Club — his idea 
— as a memorial to Eunice Evans 
Branca.” (Oh, Boss! Tm crying.) 
(We all are.) (But, Boss — Joe 
must be starving.) (We’ll take care 
of it.) 

She sighed. “I’ll be damned.” 

“Perhaps. And perhaps myself. 
But I don’t think Joe Branca will 
be. He’s an unworldly man — Joan. 
From a slum family. A flower in 
the muck. I couldn’t even get him 
to accept a lesser sum. He insisted 
on paying for witnessing and nota- 
rizing his mark, and the tax stamp 
on the assignment — and it took al- 
most every dime he could dig up. 
He just shook his head and said, 
‘Broke don’t scare me.’ ”

GALAXY 




“Jake, we must take care of 
him.” 

“I don’t think you can, Joan. 
In his own odd way he is as proud 
as she was. But I did one thing. In 
searching for him I had to get a 
court order to open their studio - 
indispensable it turned out, as an 
old letter from his mother gave us 
the clue that located him. But I 
learned that the rent was almost 
due . the corporation’s rent 
agent wanted to know how soon 
the lease was going to lapse — he 
assumed that, with her dead, the 
rent would not be paid. So I cov- 
ered the matter for the moment, 
then when I got back, I bought the 
lease. As long as Joe chooses to 
stay, he won’t be asked for rent. 
Then I checked around and located 
her bank account and arranged 
with a friendly judge to let me 
guarantee the matter and had it 
assigned to Joe without bothering 
him with legal formalities. The 
little dear was smart about money 

a nice sum, enough to keep him 
eating a couple of years I think.” 
(All gone in a couple of months, / 
think. Boss, Joe doesn’t under- 
stand money. A bank account isn’t 
real to him.) (Don’t worry, dar- 
ling, Jake and I will handle it.) 

She sighed. “I feel reassured, 
Jake. But distressed about her hus- 
band. We must look into it. If he’s 
that unworldly, then there must be 
some way to subsidize him without 
his knowing it.” 

“All right, Joan, we will try. But 
Joe Branca taught me — at my age 
- that there are things money can- 
not buy. Not if the prospective 
seller is indifferent to money.” 

“Will you have more sherry? 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



And may I have another drop? If 
you can’t stay, I think I’ll ask to 
be put to bed and right to sleep. 
Skip dinner.” 

“Oh, but you must eat, Joan. 
For your strength. Look, if I stay, 
will you eat?” 

She gave him Eunice’s best sun- 
coming-up smile. “Yes! Yes, Jake 
dear! Thank you.” 

D inner was informal, service 
only by Cunningham and two 
assistants. Joan did her best to 
simulate a charming, gracious 
hostess — while trying not to ap- 
pear greedy; everything tasted so 
wonderful\ But she waited until 
coffee had been served and Jake 
had refused a perfecto and ac- 
cepted a glass of port, and she then 
could say, “Thank you, Cunning- 
ham, that will be all,” before re- 
turning to personal matters. 

Once they were alone she said, 
“Jake, when will I be up for a 
competency hearing?” 

■'Eh'; Any time you feel well 
enough. Are you in a hurry?” 

“No. I would be utterly content 
to be your ward the rest of my 
life.” 

Her lawyer smiled slightly. 
“Joan, by the actuarial tables you 
now have a life expectancy of 
about sixty years; mine is more 
like ten or twelve.” 

“Well. .that’s hard to answer. 
But will you go on as before as my 
de facto manager? Or am 1 asking 
too much?” 

Salomon studied his glass. 
“Joan. .once the court dissolves 
this guardian-and-ward relation- 
ship, there is no reason why you 
should not manage your affairs.” 



127 




(Joan! Change the subject; he’s 
trying to leave us!) (So I know! 
Keep quiet!) (Tell him your mid- 
dle name!) “Jake. Jake dear... 
look at me. Look hard and keep 
on looking. That’s better. Jake — is 
it that you would rather not see 
me. .as 1 am now?” 

The lawyer said nothing. She 
went on, “Isn’t it better to get used 
to what /.s...than to run away 
from it? Wouldn’t she — Eunice — 
want you to stay?” (Keep slugging, 
Sis — he wants to stay.) 

“It isn’t that simple. .Joan.” 
“Nothing ever is. But I don’t 
thing you can run away from it 
any more than I can — for 1 won’t 
stop being what I am -her body, 
my mind -and you will always 
know it. All you accomplish by 
leaving is to deprive me of my one 
friend and the only man on earth 1 
trust utterly. What does it take to 
change my name?” 

“Eh?” 

“Just what I said. I changed my 
surname from ‘Schmidt’ to 
‘Smith’ when I enlisted on Decem- 
ber eighth, nineteen forty-one, sim- 
ply by spelling it that way to a re- 
cruiting sergeant. No one has 
bothered me about it since. This 
time perhaps it must be formal, 
considering the thousands of places 
where my signature appears. It is 
technically a sex-change case, is it 
not? A court takes judicial notice, 
or some such, and it’s made a mat- 
ter of record?” 

Salomon slipped into his profes- 
sional persona and relaxed. “Yes, 
of course; I had not thought about 
that aspect too many other de- 
tails on my mind. Joan, your ear- 
lier name change was legal — al- 



though informal — because any per- 
son is free to call himself by any 
name, without permission of a 
court, as long as there is no crimi- 
nal intent — to defraud, deceive, 
evade responsibility, avoid taxes, 
whatever. You can call yourself 
Joan— or Johann — or Miniver 
Cheever — and that is your name, 
as long as your purpose is inno- 
cent. And pronounce as you like. 
Knew of a case once of a man who 
spelled his name Zaustinski and 
pronounced it Jones and went to 
the trouble of publishing the odd 
pronunciation as a legal notice — 
although he did not have to; a 
name may be pronounced in any 
fashion its owner chooses.” 

“Why did he do it, Jake?” 

“His grandmother’s will re- 
quired him to change his name in 
order to inherit — but did not speci- 
fy how he must pronounce it. Joan, 
in your case a formal change of 
name is advisable, but it might be 
best to wait until you are no longer 
my ward. But de facto your new 
name is already what you say it 
is." 

“Then my name is now — Joan 
Eunice Smith.” 

S ALOMON knocked over his 
glass of port. He made quite a 
busyness of mopping it up. Joan 
said, “Jake, let it be, no impor- 
tance. I did not mean to shock 
you. But don’t you see the neces- 
sity? It’s a tribute to her, a public 
acknowledgment of my debt to 
her. Since I can never pay it, I 
want to publish it, place it on the 
wall for all to see, like a Chinese 
man’s debt to his tong. Besides 
that, ninety-five percent of me is 



128 



GALAXY 



Eunice. .and only five percent is 
old Johann now named Joan and 
even that fraction no one can see, 
only surgeons have seen it. Lastly 
but by no means least — Jake dear, 
look at me — if you ever forget that 
fraction and call me Eunice, it 
won’t matter; it’s my name. And if 
you intentionally call me ‘Eunice,’ 
it will matter, for I shall be pleased 
and flattered. And any time it suits 
you to call me ‘Joan Eunice,’ it 
will make me happy, as I will be 
certain you have done it intention- 
ally — and accepted me as I am.” 
“Very well. .Joan Eunice.” 

She smiled. “Thank you. Jake. 
I feel happier than I have felt since 
I first knew. I hope you do.” 

“Um. Yes, I think so. It’s a 
good chance — Joan Eunice.” 

“Did you get wine on your 
clothes? If so, let Cunningham see 
to it. Jake, is there any reason for 
you to go clear out to Safe Har- 
bor tonight? I’m sure Cunningham 
can find you clean socks or what- 
ever.” 

“Goodness, Joan — Joan Eunice 
— I’ve been here two nights al- 
ready.” 

“Do you think three will wear 
out your welcome? You can’t 
wear it out.” 

“And the drive isn’t that far, as 
I placed my house for sale with the 
enclave trustees months ago. I 
have rooms at the Gibraltar Club 
now. Good service, central loca- 
tion, none of the fiddin’ worries 
of a householder.” 

“I see your point. Hmm, must 
remember to resign from the Gib 
myself.” She smiled. “They’ll nev- 
er let me past the ladies’ lounge — 
now.” 



The lawyer said dryly, “I took 
the liberty of withdrawing you 
from membership shortly after I 
became your guardian — Joan Eu- 
nice.” 

She laughed in delight. “And me 
a founding member! This is deli- 
cious — souls and honks and thirds 
all welcome. .but females are sec- 
ond-class citizens. Jake, dear. I’m 
going to have to get used to a lot 
of things.” 

“I suppose so — Joan Eunice.” 
“So I’ll need you more than ev- 
er. Where are you sleeping?” 

“The Brown room.” 
“Cunningham must be slipping. 
He should have put you in the 
Green suite.” 

“Well... the Green suite has 
been used for hospital equipment 
and supplies. I authorized it.” 
“Then you can just unauthorize 
it as that is your suite. They can 
store than stuff somewhere else. 
Or remove it, as little of it will be 
needed from now on.” 

“Hedrick had most of it re- 
moved the middle of the day.” 

“All right, you stay in the 
Brown room tonight, then tomor- 
row Cunningham can get the 
Green suite in shape for you.” 
“Joan Eunice, what leads you to 
think I’m moving in here? I’m 
not.” 

“I didn’t say you were. I said 
that the Green suite is yours. 
Whether you stay a night or a 
year. Yours without invitation, 
yours to come and go without 
bothering to say hello or goodbye. 
Although I hope it will suit you to 
say hello to me frequently. Is Hu- 
bert, my former valet, still 
around?” 



I WILLFEARNOEVIL

“Yes. He’s tended me the last 
two nights.” 

“From now on he’ll tend the 
Green suite and take care of you 
whenever you honor us with your 
presence. Jake, you had better 
move some clothes here.” 

“Damn it — Pardon me, Joan 
Eunice.” 

“For saying ‘Damn it’? It’s a 
strange day when my oldest friend 
must curb his language in my pres- 
ence. Jake, I’ve heard you use lan- 
guage that would blister paint at 
forty yards — and at me, not mere- 
ly in my presence.” 

“True. But I must now remem- 
ber that you are a lady, Joan Eu- 
nice.” 

“Please yourself. I’m going to 
have more trouble learning to be a 
lady than you will have in remem- 
bering that I am supposed to be 
one. If you slip, ignore it -for you 
know that I never took a back seat 
to any muleskinner in other days. 
You were saying?” 

“Well, I was saying, ‘Damn it, 
we must remember your reputa- 
tion’ - Joan Eunice.” 

“My whaP. My reputation as a 
womarp. I doubt if I have one — 
other than as a sideshow freak. 
Doesn’t worry me.” 

“You’re not in the news, Joan 
Eunice, since shortly after the op- 
eration. Oh, you will be again 
when we go into court. .and per- 
haps sooner, when someone in 
your household staff or Dr. He- 
drick’s staff, spills the fact of your 
recovery.” 

“So I’ll be a sideshow freak 
again and who cares? A nine-day 
wonder lasts only a couple of days 
now; they wear out faster than 

130 



they did when I was a kid. Jake, I 
haven’t worried about what anyone 
said about me for over half a cen- 
tury. The image our P.R. men 
built up was for the Company, not 
for me personally. As for Mrs. 
Grundy — I think she’s dead. The 
present generation does not care 
about her opinion — a change for 
the better in a world otherwise de- 
teriorating. 1 doubt if Eunice ever 
heard of Mrs. Grundy.” (Sure 
have. Boss. My fourth-grade teach- 
er. Used to shack with the vice- 
principal until his wife found out. 
We kids giggled over it- but you 
would have liked her. .you dirty 
old darling. Keep working on Jake, 
dear -time to back away closer.) 
(Who’s driving this car?) (1 am.) 

M r. SALOMON said thought- 
fully, “I think you are right 
about this younger generation, 
Joan Eunice. Only people my age 
and older give such matters a 
thought. But you know that 1 
should not live under your roof 
now. And so do I.” 

“Jake. I am not trying to force 
you. Nor am I trying to compro- 
mise you 

“Eh? Me"! \Vs your reputation I 
was thinking of. With your ser- 
vants, at least.” 

(Why, the old hypocrite. Ask 
him about the time he crowded me 
into a cloak closet with Cunning- 
ham almost breathing down our 
necks. Go on, I dare you. Oh, he’s 
a one, that one - courage under 
fire.) “Jake, that is sweet of you 
but I don’t give a triple damn how 
my servants gossip in the kitchen. 
But I am able to protect you from 
gossip, sir. I have acquired the 

GALAXY 




most conventional of Victorian 
chaperonage — a respectable lady’s 
maid. She’ll sleep just through that 
door, where Hubert used to sleep. 
If it frets you, she can always be 
present when you and I are togeth- 
er.” (Hey, what is this? Trying to 
get Winnie into the act? She might 
go for it — Jake won’t. Watch it, 
dear.) (Quit kibitzing, Eunice.) 

The lawyer raised his brows. 
“You’ve hired a maid already? 
Surprising. Though you never were 
one to dilly-dally. Or did you shift 
around part of your in-house 
staff?” 

“Some of both, Jake. I antici- 
pated that Dr. Garcia will insist on 
my having a trained nurse. .so I 
persuaded one of the nurses to stay 
on, in both capacities. Winnie. 
You’ve seen her, the little red- 
head.” 

“Possibly I have.” 

(‘Possibly’ he says. All you men 
are hypocrites. If he hasn’t patted 
her butt, he’s thought about it.) 

“I’m lucky to get her. Intelli- 
gent. Educated. Able to teach me 
things I must know and, being a 
nurse, used to caring for people 
even more than a maid does. I used 
the usual argument — money — but 
I was careful to respect her pro- 
fessional pride; she’ll still be my 
nurse, she’ll lady’s-maid me as a 
friendly favor. I think she may be 
in bed. But she would get up and 
chaperone us if asked. Shall I send 
for her?” 

“What? Oh, don’t be silly, Joan 
Eunice. You’re making a moun- 
tain of a mole hill.” 

“It seemed to me that you were, 
Jake. I do feel defenseless as a 
woman. .even though I was far 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



more vulnerable as a sick old man 
than I am now in this strong young 
body. But I feel safe with you 
present — and not at all safe when 
you are away. Jake, I can’t urge 
you to live here. .but can’t you 
see what a favor it would be to 
me? As well as — How many 
rooms do you have at the Gib?” 
“Two. Adequate for my needs.” 
“The rooms there aren’t large 
. .whereas the living room of the 
Green suite is as large as this 
room. We could cut a door from 
it into the upstairs library and it 
could be your study. Move any- 
thing into it you need for my af- 
fairs or your own — plenty of room 
for files or books. Jake, I don’t 
need this big mausoleum any more 
than you needed your house. But 
if I tried to sell it, I couldn’t get 
ten percent of what it cost; I built 
it during the worst of the Riot 
Years and the cost doesn’t show, 
it’s a prettied-up fortress, stronger 
than police barracks. Well, we may 
have such years again, I may yet 
be glad I spared no expense. In the 
meantime it’s big and safe and 
comfortable, and you might as well 
use it. When you wish, I mean, es- 
pecially when you work on my af- 
fairs.” 

“Well, I have been working on 
some of your affairs here in the 
house. Uh, Joan Eunice, as your 
guardian, I had to take over man- 
agement of your household.” 
“Hasn’t Cunningham saved you 
from such picayune worries? I 
must speak to him.” 

“Well. .yes, he has and I’ve let 
him go on as before; I’ve made no 
changes. But I have had to look 
over the household books and au- 



131 




thorize charges and confound it, 
they’re stealing you blind. Cun- 
ningham especially.” 

“Good!" 

“What’s good about it?” 

“Jake, you told me that it was 
impossible to spend my income. If 
my butler is black-marketing two- 
thirds of what he buys for me and 
pocketing the proceeds— and he al- 
ways has- then he’s anxious to 
keep his job. Which means that he 
has to please me. Jake, can you 
think of a cheaper way to buy the 
nearest thing to loyalty that can be 
bought? Let him steal. Do not bind 
the mouths of the kine who tread 
the grain.” 

“Bad precedent. Corrupts the 
country.” 

“The country is corrupt. But ‘it 
is the only game in town;’ we have 
no choice. The problem is always 
how to live in a decadent society. 
Jake, I want you to live here. 1 
hope you will live here. It will 
make me feel happy and safe for 
you to be under the same roof. 
But don’t worry about my reputa- 
tion- and Winnie is here to pro- 
tect yours. Most certainly don’t 
think about such trivia as house- 
hold expenses; just close your eyes 
and sign. But don’t hesitate to 
chew out Cunningham if the ser- 
vice is less than perfect; that’s the 
price he must pay for the privilege 
of swindling me. By the way, my 
chief guard steals, too; I think he 
has a fifty-fifty split with Cunning- 
ham. I’ve never tried to find out 
the arrangement; it would embar- 
rass them. 

S ALOMON smiled. “Joan Eu- 
nice, for a young — and beauti- 

132 



ful woman, you sound remarkably 
like a cynical old man I used to 
know.” 

“Do I, Jake dear? I must learn 
not to sound that way. I must now 
leave the ‘cynical old man’ things 
to you and try to behave like a la- 
dy. If I can. But please don’t dis- 
rupt a smooth household by trying 
to reform it— or it will wind up 
like a reform administration: less 
efficient and still more expensive. 
Didn’t your servants steal from 
you?” 

The lawyer looked sheepish. 
“Well. .yes. But I had the best 
cook in Safe Harbor enclave. If I 
had fired her, I might have wound 
up with one just as expensive — who 
put sugar in gravy. I think I was 
groused that they were stealing 
from you — when you were help- 
less. But I didn’t want to hamper 
with your household while there 
was any chance that you might re- 
cover. Wanted to hand it back as 
it was. And 1 have. Or shall.” 
“Thank you, Jake. At the mo- 
ment, while I may not yet be a la- 
dy, I feel not at all like a cynical 
old man. I find that I feel like a 
woman who has been ill and is not 
yet fully recovered. I had best go 
to bed. Will you help me?” 

“Uh, I’ll call the nurse.” 

“Jake, Jake — this is the body I 
have; we must quit being jumpy 
about it. Here, lend me your arm. 
I can stand if you’ll help me. .and 
walk to the bed it you’ll let me 
lean on you.” 

Salomon gave up, offered her 
both hands to help her out of the 
chair, steadied her with his arm to 
the bed. Joan Eunice got into it 
quickly, slid her negligee off as she 

GALAXY 




slid under the sheet. “Thank you, 
.lake.” 

“My pleasure - Joan Euniee.” 
“Will you have breakfast with 
me? Or lunch if you want to sleep 
late?” 

“Uh. .lunch.” 

“I'm looking forward to it.” 
She put out her hand. He took it, 
bowed over it hesitated only 
slightly and kissed it firmly. 

Joan Eunice kept his hand and 
pulled. “Come closer, Jake dear.” 
.She reached up, took his face be- 
tween her palms. “You loved her.” 
“Yes.” 

“I loved her.” 

“I know.” 

“Say my name. My new name.” 
“Joan -Joan Eunice.” 

“Thank you, Jake.” Unhurried- 
ly, she pulled his face down, kissed 
him softly on the lips. “Good 
night, dear friend.” 

“Good night Joan Eunice.” 
He left quickly. 

(Joan you bitch, you’re pushing 
him too hard.) (1 am notl) (The 
hell you aren’t. Eor a second I 
thought you were going to drag 
him right into bed.) (Ridiculous!) 
(And you’re pushing yourself too 
hard, too.) (Eunice, quit crabbing. 
I could have backed out up to the 
last split second. 1 found that I did 
not mind it. After all, there are 
many cultures in which men kiss 
men, as a gesture of friendship.) 

(In case you haven’t noticed, you 
are no longer a man — you’re a 
mixed-up chiek.) (I’ve noticed. 
Look, snoopy, it was a necessary 
symbol. 1 had to show Jake that he 
could touch me. even kiss me 
good-night. .and not have it be 
tragic. And it wasn’t. Reminded 



me of my father kissing me good- 
night. .which he did until I was a 
big boy.) 

(Well. .perhaps Jake is going 
to settle for being fatherly. But 
don’t count on it^ Joan. Let me 
warn you. Sis Jake can kiss 
much better than that. He can kiss 
so well that your insides melt 
down, starting at your belly but- 
ton and spreading in all directions.) 
(.A possibility. A remote one. Now 
will you shut up and let us sleep? 
1 really am tired.) (Love me. 
Boss?) O’ve never stopped loving 
you dear and never will.) (Me. 
too and wish I could kiss you 
goodnight. Sleep, Boss every- 
thing’s going to be all right.) 

Before she could get to sleep, 
Winifred came in. in robe and slip- 
pers. “Miss Joan?” she said softly. 

“Yes, dear? Put the Door lights 
on.” 

“Mr. Salomon said that you 
had gone to bed 

“And you look as if you had. 
Did he wake you?” 

“Oh. no. I was chatting with 
Mrs. Sloan; she’s on watch. But 
Dr. Garcia left word that your bed 
was to be all the way down and I 
see that it isn't. How do I put it 
down?” 

“1 do it myself, right from the 
bed down, like that- or back up, 
like that. 1 wasn’t asleep yet. It’s 
all right. I’ll put it all the way 
down before you leave. .and you 
can tell Doctor that 1 was a good 
girl.” 

“Line! You can have this cap- 
sule if you want it. You don’t have 
to take it, Mrs. Sloan says that 
Doctor says.” 

“Ell take it; I want to go right 

133 



I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 




to sleep. If you’ll hand me the wa- 
ter there. .and kiss me goodnight. 
If you won’t, I’ll sulk and ring for 
Mrs. Sloan and ask her to kiss me 
goodnight.” 

The little nurse grinned. “I’ll 
force myself.” 

Winifred left about sixty sec- 
onds later. (Well, Eunice? How did 
that one stack up?) (Quite well, 
butch. Say eighty percent as well 
as Jake can do.) (You’re teasing.) 
(You’ll find out. Winnie is sweet — 
but Jake has had years more prac- 
tice. I’m not chucking asparagus 
at Winnie. I thought you were go- 
ing to drag her right in with us.) 
(With Mrs. Sloan outside and 
watching our heart rate? What do 
you think I am? A fool?) (Yes.) 
(Oh, go to sleep!)

In Miami Miss Universe (Miss

through her press secretary & in- 
terpreter, revealed that she in- 
tended to be the first starship com-

Einsteinian ballistics under hypno- 
sis for two years. The General 
Secretary of the People’s Fraternal 
Society of Cosmonauts, Astro-

CIO) wondered publicly as to Miss 
Universe’s ability to do simple 
arithmetic with her shoes on. Ma-

tary was a counterrevolutionary 
rat-fink and a typical example of 
male arrogance. In Los Angeles 
smog deaths were down 3% under 
emergency pollution-abatement

In a big, ugly, ornate, old house 
Miss Joan Eunice Smith sat in lo- 
tus on a mat in her dressing room 
near a large mirror and facing her 
nurse-companion-maid, also in lo- 
tus. “Comfortable, Winnie dear?” 

“Very.” 

“I think you’re even more lim- 
ber than I am. All right, let’s get 
into the mood for exercise. You 
start it.” 

“All right. But Miss Joan? 
What does it meanl Oh, I like it; 
it’s very relaxing. But what jewel 
in what lotus, and whyT' 

“It means nothing. And every- 
thing. If you must have words, it 
means peace and love and under- 
standing and anything that you 
think of as good. But it’s not for 
thinking, dear; it’s for being. Let 

GALAXY 




yourself be open to it, don’t think. 
Don’t even try not to think. Be.” 
“All right.” 

“Start us. Remember the 
breathing. I’ll get in step.” 

“Om Mani Padme Hum.” 

(Om Mani Padme Hum. See 
that aura round her. Boss? She 
must have had quite a night.) (Shut 
up, Eunice; these prayers were 
your idea.) “Om Mani Padme 
Hum.” 

“Om Mani Padme Hum.” (Om 
Mani Padme Hum) “Om Mani 
Padme Hum.” “Om Mani. .” 
(That’s enough, Joan.) (So 
short, beloved? Clock says only 
twenty minutes.) (I use a different 
clock. We’re warm all through, 
we’re ready. Winnie is more than 
ready; you’ll have to call her 
back.) 

“Om Mani Padme Hum. Wini- 
fred. Winnie darling, hear me. The 
sun is rising and so must we.” 

The little redhead was still per- 
fectly in lotus, soles of her feet 
turned upwards on her thighs, 
hands in her lap, palms upward. 
She was still intoning, with her 
breathing paced exactly with her 
prayers. But her eyes had turned 
up; only the whites showed. “Come 
back, Winnie. Time.” 

The girl’s eyes turned down to 
normal, she looked puzzled, then 
smiled. “Already? Seems like only 
a moment. I must have fallen 
asleep.” 

“Happens. Are you ready? 
Warm and loose and your muscles 
soft as cotton?” 

“Uh . yes, I am.” 

“Then let’s try some singles.” 
Joan Eunice flowed upward from 
the mat like a flower unfolding and 

I WILLFEAR NO-EVIL 



was standing. “You criticize me 
and I’ll criticize you. Then we can 
have companion exercises for des- 
sert.” Joan looked at herself in the 
long glass. “I think my belly is 
firmer every day. I keep telling 
myself.” 

“It’s perfect and you know it.” 
The redhead got up more slowly, 
caught herself in a yawn. 

“Still sleepy, dear? No pleasant 
dreams last night?” 

The girl barely blushed, then 
shrugged and smiled. “Pleasant all 
right but not enough hours. I hope 
we didn’t disturb you.” 

“Didn’t hear a sound. Wouldn’t 
have guessed if you hadn’t told me 
when you came in to kiss me good- 
night. Dear, if you’re short on 
sleep, maybe you’d rather just crit- 
icize.” 

“Oh, no, I’m getting more out 
of our exercises than you are — 
don’t want to miss a day. But — 
yes. I’m short on sleep. Paul — Oh, 
dear! But I didn’t say his last 
name.” 

“Didn’t hear you, I was rubbing 
my ears.” 

“Fibber. He didn’t leave until 
half past two. So I did lose sleep. 
Not that I minded!” 

“I’m sure you didn’t. Winnie 
dear, I did not mean to snoop. Oh, 
normal curiosity — being a virgin 
myself.” 

The nurse looked startled, said, 
“But — ” and shut up. 

Joan Eunice smiled. “Sho’, sho’, 
hon, I know what that ‘But’ means. 
Mrs. Branca was married. .and 
Johann Smith was married four 
times not to mention jumping out 
of windows. But Joan Eunice is a 
virgin — dig me, doll baby?” 



135 





“Well, looked at that way — ” 
“Only way I can look at it. So 
I’m curious as a Girl Scout. But 
telling me would still leave me 
knowing nothing, even if you 
wanted to tell, which I’m sure you 
don’t. Some day — no hurry — I 
suppose I’ll find out for myself. So 
don’t you dare blush again and 
let’s get on with our exercises. I’ll 
run through the Tortoise varia- 
tions and you push me if I need it.” 

A fter an hour of twisting and 
stretching and posing Joan Eu- 



nice said, “Enough. Much more 
and we’d be sweating instead of 
glowing. Ready for gruesome two- 
somes?” 

The high note of the outer door < 

sounded in the bath-dressingroom. 
“Damn,” said Joan. “I don’t mean 
a ladylike ‘darn.’ Damn. Into your 
tights, dear, and I’ll drop your 
smock over your head. Tell ’em 
‘No ice today.’ ” 

“Right away.” Dressed in sec- 
onds, the girl left. 

(Mow’d we look today, Eunice? 

Tits beginning to suit you?) (We’re 



more than halfway there, Joan; in 
another week you can cut the time 
down.) (Not anxious to; it’s the 
most fun of the day. .except when 
our lord and guardian deigns to 
dine with us. Tell me, hon — have 
you been fretting about those neg- 
ative reports?) (No, you have been 
fretting; they were what I expected. 
Nobody knows how memory 
works except that everyone is sure 
he knows and thinks all the others 
are fools.) (I’ve been thinking 
about those flatworms. If you can 
chop up a trained flatworm and 



feed it to another flatworm and 
then the second one seems to re- 
member what the first one learned, 
then — ) (Boss! I keep telling you, 
I am not a flatworm! I told you a 
long time ago that the body re- 
members and— let’s table it; here 
comes the fuzz.) 

“Miss Joan, it’s Dr. Garcia and 
Mr. Salomon.” 

“Oh. Well, I’m not going to 
dress; we’ve still to finish. Grab me 
a negligee — not that plate-glass 
job. The London Fog is suitable, 
don’t you think?”

“I guess. Makes you look only 
half naked instead of bare.” 

“Who taught me to dress that 
way, winsome Winnie?” (I did.) 
(Sure, Eunice — but she thinks she 
bosses me. I’m her good baby who 
always does what Mama says. 
until we get dear Doctor out of 
our hair.) “Please tell the gentle- 
men that I will be right out.” 

Miss Smith stopped to apply lip- 
stick, decided that her face could 
get along with no other renewals, 
took a brush-comb and teased her 
too-short locks into fluffiness, 
stepped into stilt-high mules, put 
on the negligee and looked at her- 
self in the long glass. 

She decided that the selective 
opacity of the robe was just right 
— except that the upper part was a 
little too modest. So she delayed 
long enough to apply lipstick to 
areolae. 

Now satisfied with her appear- 
ance — (Boss, we look like a high- 
priced pooka.) (Very high-priced, 
1 hope. Were you criticizing?) (Not 
at all, I was applauding.) — she 
went out into her boudoir. “Good 
morning. Doctor. Hi, Jake dear. 
Won’t you sit down? Coffee? Or 
we can find some Old Kentucky 
Rat Poison, bottled in the barn.” 
“Coffee,” agreed Salomon. 
“You look charming, my dear.” 
“Snake charming. I’ve been ex- 
ercising and smell like a horse.” 
“Not more than a small pony. 
I’ll turn up the ventilation. Joan 
Eunice, Dr. Garcia wants to check 
you over.” 

“Really? What’s wrong? I feel 
fine. Aside from these cold prison 
bars all around me and my head 
on a pillow stone.” 

138 



“Dr. Garcia thinks we can do 
something about those cold prison 
bars. Joan Eunice, we agreed that 
it was not smart to go into court 
until you were discharged as well 
in all respects. He thinks it may be 
possible, now.” 

“Oh. Oh\ How about that pla- 
toon of psychiatrists?” 

“We’ll have them. We may never 
need them. But we’ll be ready to 
offset their expert witnesses. You 
will have to put up with long and 
searching interviews; our own ex- 
perts must go into court pre- 
pared.” (Prepared to justify their 
fancy fees. Don’t worry. Boss.; I’ll 
hide under a rock whenever a 
shrink is around.) 

“That’s okay. I’m delighted that 
Dr. Garcia thinks I’m well. Shall 
we step into my dressing room. 
Doctor? Come along, Winnie. 
Jake, the Wall Street Journal is 
over there.” 

Once she was alone with her 
doctor and nurse Miss Smith said, 
“Well, Doctor? Shall I stretch out 
on the massage table?” 

“No, this examination is pro 
forma, to allow me to log that I 
gave you a physical on the day I 
discharged you. I’ll listen with a 
stethoscope and make you say ‘Ah 
— ’things like that. If you’ll sit 
down at your dressing table and 
drop the top of your robe, please.” 
“Yes, sir.” 

S HE kept quiet while he passed 
the stethoscope here and there, 
coughed when she was told to, in- 
haled sharply and sighed noisily as 
directed. Once she said, “Wups! 
Sorry, I’m ticklish,” and asked, 
“What does that tell you?” 

GALAXY 




“Just palpating for lumps. 
Again, pro forma — although it’s 
been some time since this was 
done.” (Enjoying it, kiddo?) (May- 
be you are, Eunice; I’m not. I’d 
rather be approached more roman- 
tic-like.) (Don’t kid your grand- 
mother; you enjoy it.) * 

The doctor stepped back and 
looked at her thoughtfully. Joan 
Eunice said, “Anything more, sir? 
G-Y-N?” 

“Not unless you ask for it. 
Trouble?” 

“Not a bit. I feel healthy enough 
to whup a grizzly bear.” 

“And you check out that 
healthy, too. Nevertheless your 
case worries me.” 

“Why, Doctor?” 

“Because your case is unique. I 
know almost as little about it as 
you do. Joan, when you left this 
house — as Mr. Smith — I never ex- 
pected to see you alive again. 
When you were brought back, I 
did not expect you to regain con- 
sciousness. When you regained 
consciousness, I felt sorry for you 
...as I never expected you to be 
other than paralyzed from the neck 
down. Yet here you are, well and 
healthy. Apparently.” 

“Why only ‘apparently,’ Doc- 
tor?” 

“I don’t know. We know little 
enough about any transplant — and 
nothing about a brain transplant 
other than what we have learned 
from you. Joan, for the past two 
weeks there has been no reason — 
other than caution — why you 
needed more supervision than any 
other young woman in good 
health. Say Winifred here, for ex- 
ample.” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



He shrugged. “Of the two you 
seem to be somewhat more rug- 
gedly healthy than she is. Never- 
theless I would bet that Winifred, 
barring accidents, will live out her 
normal span. .whereas you don’t 
fit any curve; you’re unique. 
Please, I’m not trying to frighten 
you, but only a fool makes predic- 
tions based on ignorance; I am not 
that sort of fool.” 

“Doctor,” she answered calmly, 
“you’re saying that this body could 
reject the brain — or vice versa, it’s 
the same thing. Or that I could 
drop dead, heart failure, for no de- 
fined reason. I know it; I read a 
great deal on transplants, while I 
was still Johann Smith. I am not 
afraid. If it happens — well. I’ve had 
a wonderful vacation from old age, 
with its pain and boredom.” She 
smiled happily. “It’s been like dy- 
ing and going to heaven — and even 
a few weeks of heaven can be eter- 
nity.” 

“I’m glad you accept it so philo- 
sophically.” 

“Not ‘philosophically,’ Doctor. 
With wonder and joy and reaching 
out greedily for every golden sec- 
ond!” 

“Well... I’m pleased that Wini- 
fred is going to stay with you and I 
hope that you will keep her a long 
time — ” 

“As long as she will stay! Al- 
ways, I hope.” 

“ — because, otherwise, I would 
worry. But Winnie can do in an 
emergency anything I could do and 
she’ll have everything here with 
which to do it — and she knows and 
I want you to know that I will get 
here fast if she sends for me. All 
right, my dear, let’s get that trans- 

139 




mitter off you; you won’t be moni- 
tored any longer. Nurse. Rubbing 
alcohol, and cotton.” 

“Yes, Doctor.” Winifred went 
past the massage table, reached in- 
to a cupboard. 

Dr. Garcia detached the tiny 
transmitter. “.Slight erythema, and

titis. With your amazing repair 
factor I’m betting you won’t be 
able to find where it’s been by to- 
morrow. But I’m going to miss my 
morning movie.” 

“Sir?” 

“I don’t suppose anyone has 
told you but 1 have watched the 
monitors every morning, while you 
exercised. .waiting for your heart 
to pound. Or your respiration to 
warn me. Nothing. Never anything 
abnormal, I mean; I could tell that 
you were exercising. Very mild ex- 
ercise, I concluded. 

“Why, I suppose so. Yoga.” 

“Well! I would not class yoga 
as mild. If we mean the same 
thing.” 

“I meant that yoga isn’t a hun- 
dred-yard dash, or weight lifting. 
But I well, both of us- have been 
doing the classic poses. Except the 
headstands; I’m not foolish, 1 
know 1 have a Sears-Roebuck 
skull.” 

“I wouldn’t have let her. Doc- 
tor! But she never tried one; truly 
she didn’t.” 

“Doctor, I haven’t been building 
muscles for show; 1 am simply try- 
ing to get perfect control over my 
new— wonderful body. Here, let 
me show you.” 

J OAN stood up, letting the negli- 
gee fall, stood on the floor six 

140 



inches from the exercise mat — 
shifted her weight onto her left 
foot, brought her right leg up be- 
hind her in perfect extension while 
she leaned slowly forward. .deep 
. .deeper. .until she clasped her 
left ankle with both hands and 
pressed her cheek against her shin, 
with her right leg arrow straight 
above her in a perfect split. 

She held it for three controlled 
breaths, then dropped her hands 
flat to the floor, slowly lifted her 
left leg, balancing it against the 
right, until she was holding a hand 
stand, legs together, back arched, 
toes pointed. 

Again slowly she let her limbs 
sink like drooping petals until they 
touched the mat let the Arch sink 
into the Wheel, melted still farther 
into the Diamond pose, knees and 
elbows touching mat and floor — 
held it — let it roll slowly forward 
into Lotus. “Om Mani Padme 
Hum.” (Om Mani Padme Hum. 
Pick up your check at the gate, 
girl; we won’t need to shoot this 
scene over.) (Thanks, Eunice. But 
I had a good guru. Guru.) (De na- 
da. Chela.) 

Dr. Garcia was applauding. 
“Terrific! Unbelievable. Like ev- 
erything else about this case. Win- 
nie! Can you do that?” 

Joan flowed upward, was stand- 
ing. “Sure she can! Skin ’em off, 
dear, and show Doctor.” 

The nurse blushed deeply. “No, 
I can’t Don’t believe her. Doctor; 
I’m just learning.” 

“Oh, fuff. 1 have to steady her 
only a little. Come back in two 
weeks. Doctor, and she’ll do it by 
herself. It’s not hard— just takes 
angleworms in your ancestry.”

“Which you seem to have. But, 
if Winnie didn’t teach you, where 
did you learn it, Joan?” 

(Oh, oh! Watch it. Boss he 
smells a mouse.) 

“How old are you. Doctor?” 
“Eh? Thirty. seven.” 

“I learned it about forty years 
before you were born. But didn’t 
have time to keep it up,” she went 
on. “Then for many years didn’t 
have the physique even to try. But 
it all came back so easily that 1 am 
forced to assume that Mrs. Branca 
was better at it than I was even as 
a limber kid.” (Let’s see him check 
that sweetheart.) (Never make a 
lie too complicated. Boss.) (Look, 
infant, I was lying with a straight 
face when your grandmother was 
in rompers. Erase and correct 
your great grandmother.) 

“Well. .I’m going to write it 
up as part of your final physical— 
if I can figure out how to describe 
it. Your robe, Joan?” 

“Thank you.” She took it and 
held it, instead of presenting her 
back for him to put it on her. 
“Doctor, Mr. Salomon will be 
settling your fees and expenses. 
But, to show my great apprecia- 
tion, I want to add something.” 

He shook his head. “A doctor 
should not accept more than his 
fee . and mine are high.” 
“Nevertheless I want to.” She 
dropped the robe. “Winnie, turn 
your back, dear.” She went 
straight into his startled arms, put 
up her face to be kissed. 

He hesitated about one heart- 
beat, then put his arms around her 
and kissed her. Joan sighed softly, 
her lips came open, and she flowed 
more closely against him. 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



(Don’t faint! Let’s not miss any 
of this.) (Don’t bother me, Eunice; 
I’m husy\) 

The Doctor broke from it, 
caught his breath and looked at 
her soberly. Then he reached down, 
recovered her robe and held it. 
Joan let him put it on her, then 
said, “Thank you. Doctor.” She 
turned and smiled. 

“Um. 1 think 1 can honestly re- 
port that you are in excellent phys- 
ical condition. Mr. Salomon is 
waiting.” 

“Please tell him I’ll be out in a 
moment.” 

Joan waited until the door 
closed. Then she went into Wini- 
fred’s arms and giggled against her 
shoulder. “Winnie, did you turn 
your back? Didn’t you peek a lit- 
tle? I hope.” 

“I turned my back. But I had a 
full view in the mirror. Whew\" 
“Whew twice. So that’s what it 
feels like. Honey, I don’t feel near- 
ly so virginal now.” 

“Is he good? It looked like it.” 

“I don’t know. I have no way to 
judge. Dear darling Jake kisses 
me; you’ve seen him — but Just un- 
cle sort of pecks. And you kiss me 
— and yours aren’t pecks. But 
you’re a girl and smaller than I 
am. Doctor is the first man who 
has really kissed me. .and it made 
me feel so little and helpless that I 
darn near dragged him down onto 
the mat. You’ve never kissed him?” 
“Himl Joan honey, if 1 told any 
of the nurses about this, I would 
not be believed. Dr. Garcia doesn’t 
even pat bottoms; he just growls.” 
“He patted my bottom. I think 
he did. Things were fuzzy right 
then.”

“I know he did. I saw it and 
didn’t believe it. Joan? You 
wouldn’t have made me skin down. 
Would you?” 

“Why not? I was.” 

“Yes, but you’re a patient. I’m 
a nurse, I’m supposed to be a ro- 
bot and a chaperon.” 

“Only we know you’re not.” 
“Well. .anyhow I can’t do that 
one; it’s much too hard.” 

“I told him to come back in two 
weeks and you’d be able to. Shall 
I remind him?” 

“Oh, Joan! You’re teasing me 
again.” The redhead added 
thoughtfully, “Do you really think 
I could, by myself, in only two 
more weeks?” 

“I know you can. But not in 
clothes, not even tights. So if you 
are going to blush and go chicken, 
I had better not remind dear Doc- 
tor.” 

“Uh. .that did look like quite a 
kiss. But Paul wouldn’t like it.” 
“Wouldn’t like what? Your 
demonstrating precision body con- 
trol to a doctor? Or kissing a doc- 
tor? Or what the kiss might lead 
to? And how is Paul to know if 
you don’t tell him?” (Boss, you 
are corrupting the youth of the 
land.) (Egg feathers, Eunice. Either 
Paul won’t marry her. .or he’s 
married and can’t. Either way he’s 
got no business monopolizing her. 
As you pointed out, sex is not a 
sport, it’s for being happy.) 

“Uh. .Doctor wouldn’t kiss me, 
anyway. He doesn’t even know I’m 
female.” 

“Never believe it. You are and 
he’s not stupid. He’ll kiss you if I 
suggest that it’s the applause ex- 
pected for a perfect performance.

You’ve got two weeks to make up 
your mind, and right now I’ve got 
to go see dear Jake.”

A this Honorable Court draw

“May it please the Court, while 
.Petitioners are ready to proceed, 
may they respectfully invite to the 
Court’s attention that no proper 
foundation has been laid. This 
matter relates to the competency 
of Johann Sebastian Bach Smith, 
grandfather of the four petitioners 
. .and Counsel is not aware that 
he is in court.” 

“Order] There will be order in 
the court — at once. Or the room 
will be cleared. Counsel, are you 
suggesting that Miss Smith — this 
young lady at whom I am pointing 
— is not Johann Sebastian Bach 
Smith?” 

“Counsel suggests nothing. 
Your Honor. I merely note that 
we have nothing in the record to 
show that the person at whom the 
Court pointed is Johann Sebastian 
Bach Smith — and that the question 
of competency cannot be consid- 
ered until proof of identity is in- 
dubitably established.” 

“Is Counsel attempting to in- 
struct this Court in the Law?” 

“Oh, not at all!” 

“It sounded like it. May I re- 
mind Counsel that this Court sits 
today in equity, not in law — and 
that the procedures are what the 
Court says they are.” 

“Most certainly, your honor. I 
regret if I inadvertently sounded 
otherwise.”

“You were one-sixteenth of an 
inch from contempt, and don’t let 
it happen again.” 

“Yes, Your Honor.” 

“. .as I am sick and tired of the 
behavior of about fifty percent of 
the spectators and at least ninety 
percent of the press, I order the 
bailiff to clear the room. Use a 
platoon, Evelyn, and clear these 
cattle out of the chutes promptly 
— and if that fancy video equip- 
ment is damaged in the process, 
we won’t worry about it. 

“Counsels, Petitioners, Guar- 
dian and Ward putative ward, let 
the record show — will adjourn to 
my chambers while we get this silly 
hassle cleared up.” 

“Jake, this is fun! If I’m not me, 
then I’m flat broke and footloose. 
You’ll have to marry me — to keep 
me off Welfare.” 

“Johann, shut up that drivel. 
This is serious.” 

“Jake, I refuse to see doom. If 
I’m not me, then I’m dead and it 
would be worth being broke to 
hear my will read and see the faces 
of my loving descendants when 
they discover that they wind up 
with trivial incomes that aren’t ev- 
en tax-free. Jake, every rich man 
wants to hear his will read — and 1 
may get the chance.” 

“Hmm. Under the theory they 
seem to be following, Eunice is en- 
titled to hear your will read — re- 
member that paragraph about ‘all 
persons not specifically named who 
are in my personal and private em- 
ploy at the time of my demise — ’ ” 
“Can’t say that I do, but if you 
put it in, it’s there.” 

“It’s there. If you’re not Johann, 
then you have to be Eunice. It’s an 

1 WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



‘either-or.’” (Nope! It’s both.) 
(Eunice, this is going to be fun!) 
(I think so, too. Boss.) 

The part of his chambers select- 
ed by Judge McCampbell was a 
comfortable lounge. Onee in it he 
looked around. 

“Mmm...Jake, Ned, Miss 
Smith, Alec, Mrs. Seward, Mrs. 
Frabish. You’re Mrs. Crampton, 
aren’t you? Mrs. Lopez. Parkin- 
son, how the devil did you get in 
here?” 

“Amicus curiae. Your Honor.” 
“You’re no friend of this court 
and you don’t belong here.” 
“But—” 

“Will you walk or would you 
rather be thrown out?” 

Parkinson elected to walk. When 
the door sealed behind him, the 
judge said, “Sperling, set that 
thing so I can record when 1 feel 
like it, then you can leave. Alec, 
you look as if you were all set to 
object.” 

“Me? Oh, not at all. Judge.” 
“Good. Because we’re going to 
cut through the fog on this silly 
business. Who needs a fog cutter?” 
The judge stepped to a corner bar. 
“Alec? Gin and tonic as usual?” 
“Thanks, Judge.” 

“I’m forgetting the ladies. Mrs. 
Seward? Something with alcohol? 
Or coffee? This machine will make 
tea, too, if 1 can remember which 
buttons to push. And how about 
your sister? And your cousins? 
Miss Smith? I recall what you used 
to order at the Gib some years 
back. Are your tastes the same 
now?” 

(Watch it. Boss! It’s loaded.) 
(Relax, Eunice.) “Judge, with a 
new body my tastes have changed 



143 




in many respects. But I remember 
fondly Glen Grant on the rocks — 
back before my doctors put a stop 
to it. But 1 haven’t tasted anything 
with that much authority since 
those days and, since this is a com- 
petency hearing. I’ll settle for cof- 
fee. Or a Coke, if you can twist its 
tail for that.” 

The judge rubbed his nose and 
looked thoughtful. “I’m not sure 
it’s a competency hearing until we 
settle this matter of identity. Jake 
could have told you about Glen 
Grant. The idea of Johann Smith 
ordering a Coke shakes me.” 

Joan smiled at him. “I know — 
hardly seems in character. My doc- 
tors made me quit carbonated 
drinks long before they made me 
give up whisky. Back about the 
time you entered law school. If 
I’m Johann Smith, that is. If I’m 
not, I’ll ask to be excused — as in 
that case I’m not a ward of the 
Court and shouldn’t be here. Isn’t 
that correct?” 

McCampbell looked still more 
thoughtful. “Jake, do you want to 
caution your client? No, not your 
‘client,’ your — no, not that either. 
Blessed if I know what you are; 
that’s what we’ve got to find out. 
Young lady, sit down and I’ll fetch 
you a Coke. Alec, get drink orders 
from your four ladies and serve 
them. Jake, you and Ned serve 
yourselves — Alec and I have a date 
with some fish in Nova Scotia to- 
morrow morning and I’ll be 
switched if I’ll keep fish waiting 
over a surprise turn in this hearing. 
Alec, confound your Irish soul, 
are you seriously questioning the 
identity of this young lady?” 

“Well — Judge, are you going to 

144 



talk about contempt if I suggest 
that your question is not properly 
put?” 

McCampbell sighed. “Young 
lady, pay no attention to him. He 
was my roommate in college and 
gives me a bad time whenever he 
comes into my court. Some day I 
going to give him thirty days to 
think it over — and about four-thir- 
ty tomorrow morning I’m going to 
trip him into some very cold water. 
Accidentally.” 

“Do that, Mac, and I’ll sue. In 
Canada.” 

“I know he was your roommate, 
Judge; you were both Big Greens 
— Dartmouth ’seventy-eight, was 
it not? Why not let him ask me 
questions and find out for himself 
who I am?” 

M rs. SEWARD said shrilly, 
“That’s not the way to go 
about it! First you must take the 
fingerprints of that — that impostor 
— and — ” 

‘‘‘'Mrs. SewardV 

“Yes, Judge? I was just going to 
say — ” 

"‘'Shut upV' 

Mrs. Seward shut up. Judge 
McCampbell went on, “Madam, 
simply because it suits me to be in- 
formal in my chambers do not 
think that this is not a court in ses- 
sion or that I would not find you in 
contempt. I would enjoy it. Alec, 
you had better convince her.” 

“Yes, your honor. Mrs. Sew- 
ard, any suggestions you have, you 
will make through me, not to the 
Court.” 

“But I was just going to say 
that — ” 

“Mrs. Seward, keep quiet! 

GALAXY 




You’re here only by courtesy of 
the Court until this matter of iden- 
tity is cleared up. I’m sorry, Judge. 
I advised my clients that, at the 
most, this was a holding action. I 
know that Jake Salomon would 
not risk bringing a ringer — sorry. 
Miss Smith — a ringer into court.” 

“And I know it.” 

“But they insisted. If Mrs. Sew- 
ard won’t control herself. I’ll have 
to ask your permission to with- 
draw from the case.” 

The judge shook his head and 
grinned. “No, sirree, Alec. You 
fetched them here, you’re stuck 
with them — at least until court ad- 
journs. Jake? Is Ned still fronting 
for you? Or will you speak for 
yourself?” 

“Oh, I think we can both speak 
up from time to time, without fric- 
tion.” 

“Ned?” 

“Of course. Judge. Jake can 
speak for himself and should. But 
I’m finding it interesting. Novel 
situation.” 

“Quite. Well, speak up if you 
have anything to contribute. Alec, 

I don’t think we can get anywhere 
today. Do you?” 

Alec Train stood mute. Joan 
said, “Why not. Judge? I’m here. 
I’m ready. Ask me anything. Bring 
out the rack and the thumb screws 
-I’ll talk.” 

The judge again rubbed his nose. 
“Miss Smith, I sometimes think 
that my predecessors were overly 
hasty in letting such tools be abol- 
ished. I think I can settle to my 
own satisfaction whether or not 
you are the person known as Jo- 
hann Sebastian Bach Smith, of 
this city and of Smith Enterprises,

Limited. But it is not that simple. 
In an ordinary identity case Mrs. 
Seward’s suggestion of fingerprints 
would be practical. But not in this 
case. Alec? Do petitioners stipulate 
that the brain of their grandfather 
was transplanted into another 
body?” 

Petitioners’ counsel looked un- 
happy. “May it please the court, 1 
am under instructions not to stip- 
ulate anything of the sort.” 

“So? What’s your theory?” 

“Uh, ‘Missing and presumed 
dead,’ I suppose. We take the posi- 
tion that the burden of proof is on 
anyone who steps forward and 
claims to be Johann Sebastian 
Bach Smith.” 

“Jake?” 

“I can’t agree as to the burden 
of proof. Judge. But my client — 
my ward who is also my client, Jo- 
hann Sebastian Bach Smith — is 
present in court and I am pointing 
at her. I know her to be that 
named individual. Both of us are 
ready to be questioned by the 
Court in any fashion in order to as- 
sure the Court as to her identity. I 
was about to say that both of us 
are willing to be questioned by any- 
one — but on second thought I can- 
not concede that there is any inter- 
ested party other than my client.” 
“Judge—” 

“Yes, Miss Smith? Jake, do you 
want her to speak?” 

“Oh, certainly. Anything.” 

“Go ahead. Miss Smith.” 
“Thank you. Judge, my grand- 
daughters can ask me anything. 
I’ve known them since they were 
babies; if they try to trip me. I’ll 
have th'bm hanging on the ropes in 
two minutes. For example, Johan- 

145 




na — the one you called Mrs. Sew- 
ard — was hard to housebreak. On 
her eight birthday — May fif- 
teenth, nineteen-sisty, the day the 
Paris Conference between Eisen- 
hower and Khrushchev broke down 
— her mother, my daughter Eve- 
lyn, invited me over to see the little 
brat have her birthday cake, and 
Evelyn shoved Johanna into my lap 
and she cut loose — ” 

“I did no such thing!” 

“Oh, yes, you did, Johanna. 
Evelyn snatched you off my lap 
and apologized and said that you 
had a bed-wetting problem. Can’t 
say as to that — my daughter lied 
easily.” 

“Judge, are you going to sit 
there and let that — that person — 
insult the memory of my dead 
mother?” 

“Mrs. Seward, your counsel 
cautioned you. If you don’t heed 
this caution, this Court is capable 
of nailing you into a barrel and let- 
ting you speak only when I say to 
pull out the bung. Or some such. 
Squelch her, Alec. Suppress her 
the way they did in the trial in 
Alice in Wonderland — which this 
is beginning to resemble. She’s not 
a party to this; she is here only to 
give evidence in case the Court 
needs it. Miss Smith — ” 

“Yes, sir?” 

“Your opinions as to the verac- 
ity of your putative descendants 
are not evidential. Can you think 
of anything that Johann Smith 
would know and that I would know 
or could check on — but which Jake 
Salomon could not possibly have 
briefed you on?” % 

“That’s a tough one. Your Hon- 
or.” 

146 



“So it is. But the alternative — 
today — is for me to assume that 
you are an impostor most careful- 
ly coached and then to question 
you endlessly in an attempt to trip 
you. I don’t want to do that. .be- 
cause final identification — now 
that the matter has been raised — 
will have to be by evidence as con- 
clusive as fingerprints. You see 
that, don’t you?” 

“Yes, I see it but I don’t quite 
see how.” She smiled and spread 
her graceful hands. “My finger- 
prints — and everything about me 
that can be seen — are those of my 
donor.” 

“Yes, yes, surely — but there are 
more ways of killing a cat than 
buttering it with parsnips. Later.” 
“Harrumph!” 

“Yes, Jake?” 

“Judge, in the interests of my 
client 1 cannot concede that phys- 
ical means of identifying this body 
are relevant. The question is: Is 
this the individual designated by 
Social Security number 551-20- 
0052 and known to the world as 
Johann Sebastian Bach Smith? I 
suggest that ‘Estate of Parsons vs 
Rhode Island,’ while not on all 
fours, is relevant.” 

M e CAMPBELL said mildly, 
“Jake, you are much older 
than I am and I’m reasonably sure 
you know the law more thoroughly 
than I do. Nevertheless, here to- 
day, I am the judge.” 

“Certainly, Your Honor! May 
it please the Court, 1 — ” 

“So quit being so damned re- 
'spectful in my chambers. You sat 
on my orals and voted to pass me, 
so you must think I know some

law. Of course the Parsons case is 
relevant; we’ll get to it later. In the 
meantime I’m trying to find a ba- 
sis for a pro-tem ruling. Well, 
Miss Smith?” 

“Judge, I don’t care whether I’m 
identified or not. In the words of a 
gallant gentleman: ‘Broke don’t 
scare me.’ ” She suddenly chuck- 
led and glanced at her granddaugh- 
ters. “May I tell you something 
funny — privately?” 

“Mmm...I could clear the 
room of everyone but you and 
your counsel; nevertheless you had 
better save any jokes until after 
we adjourn.” 

“Yes, sir. May I address one ir- 
relevant remark to my grand- 
daughters?” 

“Hmmph. I may strike it from 
the record. Go ahead.” 

“Thank you, Judge. Girls — Jo- 
hanna, Marla, June, Elinor — look 
at me. For thirty-odd years you 
have been waiting for me to die. 
Now you hope to prove that I am 
dead, else this silly business would 
never have come up. Girls, I hope 
you get away with it. .for I can’t 
wait to see your faces when my 
will is read.” (You zapped ‘em. 
Boss! Look at those expressions!) 
(I surely did, darling. Now shut up; 
we’re not home free.) 

“Your honor — ” 

“Yes, Alec?” 

“May I suggest that this is not 
relevant?” 

Joan cut in. “But I said it would 
be irrelevant, Mr. Train. Just the 
same, they had better start think- 
ing about how to break my will, 
instead of this nonsense.” She add- 
ed thoughtfully, “Perhaps I had 
better set up a lifetime trust that 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



will make them slightly better off 
with me alive than dead. .to pro- 
tect myself against patricidal as- 
sassination. Judge, is ‘patricidal’ 
the right word? Now that I’m fe- 
male?” 

“Blessed if I know. Better make 
it ‘avicidal’ — no, avicide already 
means the killing of birds and has 
nothing to do with avus. Never 
mind. Miss Smith, take up such 
matters with your attorney and let 
us return to our muttons. Have 
you thought of anything which 
Jake Salomon could not have 
coached you on?” 

“It’s difficult. Jake has been 
handling my affairs for most of a 
generation. Mmm, Judge, will you 
shake hands with me?” 

“Eh?” 

“We had best do it under the ta- 
ble, or out of sight of anyone but 
Mr. Train.” 

Looking puzzled the Judge went 
along with her request. Then he 
said, “Be damned! Excuse me. 
Miss Smith — shake hands with 
Alex.” 

Joan did so, letting her body 
cover it from spectators. Mr. 
Train looked surprised, whispered 
something to her which she an- 
swered in a whisper. (Boss, what 
was that?) (Greek. Tell you later, 
dear — though girls aren’t supposed 
to know.) 

McCampbell said, “Mr. Salo- 
mon could not have coached you?” 

“Ask him. Jake was a Barb, not 
3. Cjrcck 

“Of course I was a Barb,” Salo- 
mon growled. “I had no stomach 
for being the exhibit Jew in a chap- 
ter that did not want its charter 
lifted. What is this?” 



147 




Train said, “Well, it seems that 
Miss Smith is a fraternity brother 
of the Judge and myself. Mmm. 
sister, 1 suppose. Judge, it’s easy 
to check this on both Johanm 
Smith and Mr. Salomon. In the 
meantime I find it persuasive.” 
“Perhaps I can add to it,” Joan 
said. “Mr. Train — Brother Alec — 
of course you should check on 
both Jake and myself. But look me 
up in our fraternal archives under 
‘Schmidt’ rather that ‘Smith’ as I 
changed my name in ’forty-one. 
Which my granddaughters know. 
But you both know of our frater- 
nal Distress Fund?” 

“Yes.” 

“Certainly, Miss Smith.” 

“The fund did not exist when 1 
was pledged — my senior year it 
was, after I made Phi Beta Kappa 
and because our local chapter 
needed a greasy grind and had an 
alumnus willing to pay for my ini- 
tiation. The fund was started dur- 
ing World War Two; 1 helped aug- 
ment it some years later and was 
one of its trustees from ’fifty-six 
until late in the ’eighties when I 
dropped most outside activities. 
Judge, you tapped the fund for fif- 
teen hundred in the spring of ’sev- 
enty-eight.” 

“Eh? So 1 did. But I paid it 
back, eventually — then donated the 
same amount at a later time, ac- 
cording to our customs.” 

“I’m glad to hear it. The latter, 
I mean; you were off the hook be- 
fore I resigned as a trustee. I was a 
hard-nosed trustee. Judge, and nev- 
er okayed a loan until I was cer- 
tain that it was a distress case and 
not just a convenience to a lazy 
undergraduate. Shall 1 relate the 

148 



circumstances which caused me 
to okay your loan?” 

T he judge blinked. “1 would 
rather you did not, at least not 
now. Alec knows them.” 

“Yes,” agreed Train. “I would 
have lent him the money myself if 
1 had had it.” (What is this. Boss?) 
(Case of ‘rheumatic fever,’ sweet.) 
(Abortion money?) (No, no -he 
married the girl- and here I am 
digging up the skeleton.) (Bitch.) 
(No, Eunice -my granddaughters 
don’t know what I’m talking 
about, nor does Jake.) 

“I see no reason to discuss it,” 
Miss Smith went on, “unless the 
judge wants to question me pri- 
vately- and if you do. Judge, do 
remind me to tell you a real gig- 
gle about the ancestries of my so 
loving granddaughters. Odd things 
happen even in the best families — 
and the Schmidt family was never 
One of the best. We’re a vulgar lot, 
me and my descendants — our only 
claim to prominence is too much 
money.” 

“Later perhaps. Miss Smith. I 
am now ready to hand down a de- 
cision-temporary and conserva- 
tive. Counsels?” 

“Ready, Judge.” 

“Nothing to add, your Honor.” 
McCampbell fitted his fingertips 
together. “Identity. It need not de- 
pend on fingerprints or retinal pat- 
terns or similar customary evi- 
dence. John Doe could lose both 
hands and both feet, have both eyes 
gouged out, be so scarred and 
damaged that even his dentist could 
not identify him — and he would 
still be John Doe, with the same 
Social Security number. Some- 

GALAXY 




thing like that happened to you, 
Miss Smith, assuming that you are 
indeed Johann Sebastian Bach 
Smith — though I am happy to 
see — ” he smiled -“that no scars 
show. 

“This Court finds persuasive the 
evidence of your identity brought 
out in this hearing. We assume, 
pro tern, that you are Johann Se- 
bastian Bach Smith. 

“However — ” the judge looked 
at Salomon — “we now get to the 
Parsons case. Inasmuch as the Su- 
preme Court has ruled that the 
question of life or death resides in 
the brain and nowhere else, this 
Court now rules that identity must 
therefore reside in the brain and 
nowhere else. In the past it has nev- 
er been necessary to decide this 
point; now it is necessary. We find 
that to rule in any other fashion 
would be inconsistent with the in- 
tent of the Supreme Court in 
‘Estate of Henry M. Parsons vs 
Rhode Island.’ To rule in any oth- 
er way would create chaos in fu- 
ture cases in any way similar to 
this one: Identity must lie in the 
brain. 

“Now, Jake, I am in effect go- 
ing to shove the burden of the 
proof over onto you and your cli- 
ent. At a later time you must be 
prepared to prove beyond any pos- 
sible doubt that Johann Sebastian 
Bach Smith’s brain was removed 
from his body and transplanted in- 
to this body — ’’ McCampbell 
pointed. 

Jake nodded. “I realize that. 
Judge. A person who wants to cash 
a check must prove his identity — 
this is on all fours. But today we 
were taken by surprise.” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“So was the Court — and, Alec, 
I’m going to take you by surprise 
someday. .with something better 
than a pie bed or an exploding ci- 
gar. Damn it, you should have 
warned Court and Counsel.” 

“1 apologize. Your Honor. I re- 
ceived my instructions quite late.” 
“You should have at once asked 
for a continuance, not let this 
hearing open. You know better. 
Never mind, the hearing has been 
instructive. Miss Smith — Miss Jo- 
hann Sebastian Bach Smith sub- 
ject to remarks above — you were 
made a ward of this Court and 
placed under the guardianship of 
Mr. Jacob Salomon for one rea- 
son alone: You were at the time 
not competent to manage your af- 
fairs by reason of post-operative 
incapacity. Let the record show 
that neither insanity in the legal 
sense nor mental illness in the 
medical sense had anything to do 
with it; you were in an extended 
condition of unconsciousness fol- 
lowing surgery and that was all. 
You are no longer unconscious, 
you appear to be in good health, 
and the Court takes judicial no- 
tice that during this hearing you 
appeared always to be alert and 
clear-headed. Since the sole condi- 
tion-unconsciousness — on which 
you were made ward no longer ob- 
tains, you are now no longer a 
ward and Mr. Salomon is dis- 
charged of his guardianship — 
what’s the trouble, Alec?” 

“May it please the Court — as 
coun,sel for the Petitioners I must 
ask to have an objection entered 
into the record.” 

“On what grounds?” 

“Why, lack of expert witnesses 

149 




as to, uh, ‘Miss Smith’s’ compe- 
tence.” 

“Do you have expert witnesses 
ready to examine her?” 

“Of course.” 

“Jake?” 

“Certainly. Waiting on call.” 

“How many?” 

“Harrumph! One more than 
Alec has, however many he quali- 
fies.” 

“So I expected and if we start 
qualifying expert witnesses now 
and let each one exercise his little 
ego, those fish in Nova Scotia 
would die of old age. Keep your 
shirt on, Alec. No expert witnesses 
were used to show this person’s in- 
competence; the gross condition of 
unconsciousness was stipulated — 
and now no longer exists. Alec, 
your objection goes into the rec- 
ord but 1 am putting you on no- 
tice that your claim of need for ex- 
pert witnesses lacks foundation — 
and this time the burden of proof 
is on you. Petitioners will have to 
show something more than great 
anxiety to get their hands on the 
large sums of money at stake in 
this matter. Every citizen, every 
person, is conditionally presumed 
to be competent — and that means 
everyone — you, me, Jake, Miss 
Smith, Petitioners, and the illiter- 
ate who fills that bar and cleans 
out the empties. This Court will 
not set the extremely bad prece- 
dent of allowing you, or anyone, 
to conduct a fishing expedition in- 
to the matter of a person’s compe- 
tency without proper foundation. 
However — Jake.” 

“Yes, Judge.” 

“We all know what this hearing 
is really about. Money. Lots of 

150 



money. You might explain to Miss 
Smith that her competence may be 
challenged at some later time.” 
“We’re prepared for it.” 

“While I’ve discharged you as 
her guardian, you will stay on as 
conservator of the property of Jo- 
hann Sebastian Bach Smith pend- 
ing positive proof of identity — and 
I do mean positive', you’ve got to 
trace Smith’s brain into this body 
every step of the way. What was 
the name of that surgeon? Boyle? 
I suppose you’ll need him. And 
several others. I’m not going to 
take anything for granted, nor per- 
mit any stipulations; there is too 
much at stake and I don’t intend 
to be reversed. Alec, if you are go- 
ing to challenge competency, you 
will have to wait until after that 
time and — if it’s in my court — 
show foundation for such chal- 
lenge. That satisfy you?” 

“I guess it will have to.” 

“I guess so, too. Court’s ad- 
journed.” 



M rs. SEWARD stood up, red- 
faced, and said to Alec Train, 
‘‘You’refiredr 

McCampbell said coldly, “Ma- 
dam, consider yourself lucky that 
you saved that outburst until after 
Court adjourned. Now, get out of 
my chambers. You other three la- 
dies may leave, too.” 

Johanna’s sister June said as she 
stood up: “Judge, may 1 ask a 
question?” 

“Certainly, Mrs. Frabish.” 
“You’ve turned this person 
loose — that’s all right. I’m not 
criticizing. But are you leaving her 
in our grandfather’s house? I think 

GALAXY 




you ought to know that it is 
loaded, simply loaded, with valu- 
able works of art. What is to keep 
her from gutting it while we are 
proving that she can't be our 
grandfather?” 

“Oh. Madam, Mr. Salomon 
knows the duties and responsibil- 
ities of a conservator. However — 
Jake, it would be prudent not to 
permit any objects of sentimental 
or artistic value to leave that house 
during this waiting period.” 

“No problem. Since I’ve had to 
manage the household I’ve been 
staying there much of the time. 
But I’ll have a word with Johann’s 
chief guard.” 

“Judge, may I say something?” 
“Certainly, my - Miss Smith.” 
“I’d like protection against 
them. June doesn’t know what ob- 
jets d’art I own. Not one of them 
has Deen inside my house since it 
was built. During my long illness 
and confinement not one of them 
called on me or sent flowers or 
anything. And the same for my 
post-surgery convalescence — ex- 

cept that I learned that Johanna — 
Mrs,. Seward — tried to crash in 
right after my operation. I don’t 
trust them; I’d like the Court’s 
protection.” 

“Jake?” 

“I wasn’t there but I heard it 
from Johann’s chief guard.” 

“Mrs. Seward?” 

She sniffed. “I had a perfect 
right! Next of kin.” 

“I think I understand it. All 
right, you four ladies — listen care- 
fully, then leave. You will refrain 
from visiting the home or offices 
or other properties of Johann Se- 
bastian Bach Smith. You will re- 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



frain from making any attempt to 
see or to speak with this young 
lady I have been addressing as 
Miss Smith. If you need to com- 
municate with her or with the 
Court’s appointed conservator Mr. 
Salomon, you will do so only 
through this Court or through 
your attorney, whoever he may be, 
to Mr. Salomon and wever directly 
to Miss Smith. This is an order to 
all four of you and each of you 
will obey under pain of severe pen- 
alties for contempt. Do you under- 
stand? Are there any questions?” 

McCampbell waited, then went 
on, “Very well. Now all four of 
you leave.” 

The judge remained standing 
while they filed out. When the 
door sealed, he sighed. “Whew! 
Miss Smith — or should I say 
‘Brother Schmidt?’ — will you have 
that Glen Grant on rocks now? 
Glenlivet actually, I don’t have 
Glen Grant.” 

She smiled. “Truly, I haven’t 
tried anything that potent on this 
new body. Jake and I should leave 
— you and Brother Alec have a 
date with a fish.” 

“Oh, do sit down. Alec has his 
gear in his car in the basement and 
my copter is picking us up from 
the roof in about an hour. Another 
Coke?” 

“Is there sherry? I get a very 
pleasant buzz on just a glass of 
sherry — I conclude that my donor 
did not drink at all.” (Almost nev- 
er, Boss — and you’re giving me a 
taste for the stuff.) (Quiet, darling 
— later.) (All right. .but ask him 
about our name. Isn’t Judgie 
Wudgie a darling? Wonder what 
he’s like in bed?) (You and your 

151 




one-track mind! I’ll ask him about 
our name. Now shut up!) 

“Sherry it shall be. Jake? Ned? 
Alec?” 

“Judge, since Jake doesn’t need 
me. I’ll ask to be excused.” 

“Okay, Ned. Alec, serve your- 
self and take care of Jake; I want 
to stare at Brother Schmidt. I 
probably won’t be seeing you 
again. Miss Smith. Your grand- 
daughters are almost certain to 
try to move it into a higher court. 
That business of proving who you 
are by our fraternity grip — that 
tore it. All I could do today was 
to give you a little protection in 
the interim.” 

“Which I appreciated, sir. 
Here’s an odd thing about this sex 
change. When I was an old man, 
frail and helpless, I was afraid of 
nothing. Now I’m young and 
healthy and strong. But female. 
To my surprise I find that I want 
to be protected.” 

Alec Train said over his shoul- 
der from the bar, “I’ll protect you. 
Brother Schmidt! Don’t trust 
Brother McCampbell — he was the 
worst wolf in our chapter. Step 
aside. Brother Wolf — it’s my turn 
to stare at our new brother.” 

“Boys, I am not a ‘new brother,’ 
I was pledged years before you 
were born. But I’m not surprised 
that you like to stare at me, as my 
donor — Jake, do they know?” 

“It’s not much of a secret, Jo- 
hann. Judge McCampbell knows, I 
think Alec knows, too.” (Joan, if 
he doesn’t know, tell him. And 
don’t forget our name!) (What do 
you think I’m leading up to?) 

“All right. My donor, Eunice 
Branca, my former secretary and 

152 



the sweetest, loveliest girl I’ve ever 
known, was not only a perfect sec- 
retary; she was a beauty contest 
winner not many years back. I 
know what a treasure 1 inherited 
from her. I don’t wear her body 
with the charming grace she gave 
it — but I’m trying to learn.” 
(You’re learning. Boss.) 

“It is the opinion of this court 
that you have learned.” 

“Shut up, Mac. Brother 
Schmidt, I agree with him merely 
because he’s right.” 

“Thank you both — on behalf of 
Eunice Branca. Jake? Now that 
court has adjourned do I have to 
wear this Mother Hubbard? It’s 
too warm.” 

“That’s up to you. I suppose it 
depends on how much you have on 
under it.” 

“Mmm . perhaps I’d better 
not. Minimum decency under the 
customs of today — but it would 
get a burlesque queen thirty days 
back when I was a youngster.” 
(Exhibitionist. You’re asking to 
be coaxed.) (Certainly. And who 
taught me? At least the bra isn’t 
just paint, like that mermaid outfit 
you zapped me with.) 

A lec train said, “Brother 
Schmidt, in identity cases it is 
sometimes necessary to require 
the challenged individual to strip 
completely. Birthmarks and scars 
and such — tell her. Judge.” 

“Not in my court. Ignore him. 
Brother Schmidt. I wouldn’t call 
that lovely Grecian robe a ‘Mother 
Hubbard.’ But I can see that it was 
intended for outdoors and I’ll hap- 
pily hang it up for you.” 

“Uh ... oh, goodness. I’m hav- 

GALAXY 




ing trouble shucking off my early- 
twentieth-century Puritanism. Jake 
has seen me in the nothing-much 
girls wear today, and he’s seen Eu- 
nice in even less than I have on un- 
der this; Eunice wasn’t shy about 
sharing her beauty.” (You milked 
that, didn’t you, dearie? Which one 
are you after?) (Shut up!) Joan ran 
a finger down the magnostrip, let 
the robe fall open; Alec Train hur- 
ried to claim it ahead of the judge. 

Then she posed. “See? This is 
almost the way Eunice Branca 
looked except that she walked in 
glory, always . while I am an 
old man who is trying to learn to 
wear her body.” Besides Eunice’s 
body, Joan was wearing some of 
Winnie’s clothes — black frill skirt, 
translucent black Cling-On cups, 
six-inch sticktite stilt sandals that 
left her pretty feet in view — no 
paint, just restrained enhancement 
with rouge and shadow. 

She posed, they stared. Jake 
cleared his throat louder than 
usual. “Joan, had I known what 
you were wearing — not wearing, 
rather under that robe, 1 would 
have advised you to keep it on.” 
“Oh, pooh, Jake, you wouldn’t 
have scolded Eunice for dressing 
this way. But that brings up some- 
thing I must ask. Judge, I can’t go 
on being Johann Smith. Will you 
let me change my name?” 

“That’s not properly put. 
Brother Schmidt. You can have 
any name you like. At most a 
court confirms it. You mean that 
you need a girl’s name now. Elelen, 
perhaps? Or Cleopatra?” 

“Thank you — for Eunice.” 
(Boss, find out if Judge is still 
married.) (Go back to sleep!) 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“Not either of those names. I want 
to be known as Joan — for Johann 
Joan . Eunice . Smith.” 
Judge McCampbell looked sur- 
prised, then smiled in approval. “A 
good choice. The flavor of your 
masculine name, plus, I assume, 
a tribute to your donor. But may 
I offer a word of advice? You can 
start calling yourself that today- 
“I already have.” 

“I noticed that Jake called you 
Joan. But let it be a family name, 
and keep your masculine name at 
other times — use it to sign letters, 
checks, and so forth — until your 
identity has been finally established 
- in the Supreme Court if possi- 
ble. Don’t cloud the issue.” 

“1 gave her the same advice,” 
Salomon put in. 

“I’m not surprised. Miss — 
Brother Schmidt, what do you 
want me to call you? In private.” 
“Why, either Joan or Eunice. 
Both by preference, as I do not 
want anyone ever to forget Eunice 
Branca. Me least of all — I want to 
be reminded of my benefactor. 
Benefactrix. But don’t call me 
‘Miss’ in private. Eook, brothers, 
as Brother Schmidt I am half a 
century older than you two . but 
as Joan Eunice I am only a few 
weeks old. However, Eunice’s 
body is that of a young woman, 
and that is what 1 am learning — 
must learn — to be. You could 
have daughters my age. So please 
call me Joan Eunice and save Miss 
Smith for court appearances.” She 
smiled. “Or Brother Schmidt if 
you wish — although Yonny was 
what I was called by our brothers 
in my chapter.” 

Alec said, “Joan Eunice Brother 

153 




Yonny Schmidt, I’m pleased to 
call you whatever you like, and I 
don’t have daughters your age and 
you make me feel younger just to 
look at you. But I’m not speaking 
for my roommate and. I’d hate to 
tell you how old some of his off- 
spring are; he was the scourge of 
P.S. Two-thirty-eight — stay away 
from him and let me protect you. 
And did I mention how happy I am 
that Mrs. Seward fired me? 
Brother Joan Eunice, 1 would 
never have been in this case other 
than as a favor to Parkinson’s 
mother-in-law. But at first it did 
look like a straightforward case of 
protecting the interests of an inva- 
lid too ill to protect himself. Be- 
lieve me.” 

“Don’t listen to him,” advised 
the judge. “He’s an ambulance 
chaser. I throw legitimate business 
his way just to protect the good 
name of our Brothers. But back to 
this matter of identity. Joan Eu- 
nice, I don’t know how much law 
you know — ” 

“Just what has rubbed off in the 
course of a long and evil life. I de- 
pend on experts. Such as Jake.” 

“I see. Well, your granddaugh- 
ters probably think it is wrong of 
me to help you establish your 
identity. It is not. True, in a civil 
suit or a criminal action a judge 
must be impartial. But such a 
matter as establishing identity is 
neither one, and there is no rule of 
law or equity which prohibits'a 
court from being helpful. The sit- 
uation is like that of a citizen who 
has lost his passport and appeals 
to his consul. The consul doesn’t 
sit as a judge; he tries to get the 
mixup straightened out. So — 

154 



Jake, you’ve been in the Law much 
longer than I have; do you want 
my opinions?” 

“I am always most happy to 
have Judge McCampbell’s opin- 
ions on any matter.” 

<<TTHINK I’ll reconvene court 
land slam you for contempt. 
After I’ve finished this drink. All 
right, you’re going to get ’em any- 
how. Do you anticipate any diffi- 
culty in proving that the brain of 
Brother Schmidt was moved into 
the body of Eunice Branca?” 

“None. A nuisance but no diffi- 
culty.” 

“Or in showing that this body — 
this lovely body — was once that of 
Eunice Branca?” 

“Same answer.” 

“What evidence?” 

“Police reports, photographs, 
hospital personnel and so forth.” 
“Let’s say it’s my court. I’m go- 
ing to make you go back and 
touch second at every opportunity. 
1 intentionally got into the record 
today that ruling based on ‘Par- 
son’s estate vs Rhode Island;’ I 
think it’s important 
“So do I.” 

“Thank you. In following the 
principle that identity lies in the 
brain and nowhere else — ” (We 
could tell him something, couldn’t 
we. Boss?) (Yes, beloved— but we 
aren’t going to!) — “I am going to 
be as tough as possible. No depo- 
sitions when it is possible to bring 
the witness into court. Photo- 
graphs and other records not only 
allowed but required — but the 
originals must be brought into 
court, not copies, and photograph- 
ers or record keepers must appear 

GALAXY 




and identify same, and the sur- 
geons or others whose work ap- 
pears in those films, photographs, 
or records must appear and con- 
firm each record. Do you know if 
each body was fingerprinted just 
prior to surgery?” 

“Not of my own knowledge. 
Damn it, I was taken by surprise 
today — and at the time of Eunice 
Branca’s death I had other things 
worrying me.” 

Joan Eunice reached over and 
squeezed his hand. 

Alec Train said, “I can help on 
that. When Parkinson brought 
Mrs. Seward to see me, I checked 
on that point at once. Prints were 
taken from both bodies — so I gave 
identity no further thought. That’s 
why I was taken as much by sur- 
prise as you two. I don’t know 
what chimney-corner lawyer put 
the idea in Mrs. Seward’s head — 
Parkinson, probably: I’m sure 
he’s stayed at her elbow all 
through — but I received instruc- 
tions just as court convened. I’m 
not spilling any privileged com- 
munication when I say that — nor 
do I know of any canon which for- 
bids me to say that I am damn 
sick of both Mrs. Seward and Par- 
kinson.” 

“Hmm. Every possible bit of 
evidence,” McCampbell went on. 
“You will have to trace that brain 
out of that body— Joan Eunice — 
no, Jake. Jake, do you know what 
became of Johann Smith’s body?” 

“That one I can answer. Here 
we have a unique case of a body 
becoming a chattel while the per- 
son who lived in it is still alive. I 
knew what Johann Smith — Joan 
Eunice, that is — had wanted done 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



with it, as his will contains the 
standard ‘donated for medical re- 
search’ clause. But the will did not 
control because Johann Smith 
was, and is, alive. The Medical 
Center asked what to do with it. I 
told them to hold it, in their mor- 
gue. I assume that it is still there.” 
Mr. Train said, “Counselor, I 
hope you’re right. But unless that 
cadaver was nailed down, two gets 
you ten that some eager medical 
student has chopped it up.” 

The judge said, “I’m afraid Alec 
could be right. Jake, it may be a 
matter of great urgency to perpet- 
uate the evidence — all the evidence. 
Verb. sap. We all know how key 
evidence has a way of disappear- 
ing when big money is involved. 
And besides eager medical stu- 
dents — well, we all know that al- 
most any illegal act is for sale at 
a price. Eilms and records can be 
stolen, others substituted, ostensi- 
bly respectable witnesses can be 
bribed. Let’s speculate for a mo- 
ment that Brother Schmidt is op- 
posed by nameless dishonest per- 
sons, persons willing to bribe, sub- 
orn, and so forth. Such crime is 
not cheap. Does anyone have a 
guess as to how much money 
might be used to destroy or change 
the evidence?” 

Jake said, “I won’t guess. But 
in the case of four nameless fe- 
males I can find out.” 

J OAN said, “I can help a little 
on this. Marla and Elinor lost 
their father before they were of 
age and his estate wound up minus 
and no insurance to speak of. So I 
supported my daughter Roberta 
until she died and kept her kids in 

155 




school until they flunked out, then 
continued to support them until 
each married — one of their griev- 
ances against me is that I stopped 
their allowances when they mar- 
ried. But 1 continued a credit 
watch on them as 1 did not want 
any descendant of mine to become 
a charge on the taxpayers. Much 
the same with the other two girls 
except that Jim Darlington out- 
lasted my daughter Evelyn, and 
both girls —Johanna and June - 
married while their parents were 
living. To put it briefly, unless one 
of them has come into some wind- 
fall, all four could not scrape to- 
gether enough money to tackle 
any really expensive crime.” 

“Tm glad to hear it,” said Mc- 
Campbell. “Just the same, Jake, 
time is of the essence in preserv- 
ing evidence - and I want you to 
know that this court will give you 
all possible legal help in protect- 
ing and perpetuating any evidence 
you dig up. Unh, Alec and I plan 
to be away four days — but I'll 
leave my emergency wavelength 
with Sperling and will bounce back 
here if you need me.” 

“Thank you, sir.” 

“Wait a minute,” said Alec 
Train. “There is money in this 
case. Mac, you know how 1 am 
about fees.” 

“Yes. Larcenous.” 

“Ignore him. Brother Schmidt. 
1 tailor my fees, all the way from 
zero up to outrageous. In this 
case 1 did not want the job so I 
demanded an outrageous retainer 
against a, yes, lareenous per diem 
- and Parkinson paid without a 
quiver. Through Mrs. Seward 
but there was no question as to 

156 



who called the tune. The question 
is, will Parkinson go on paying . 
and is he willing to hire his friend- 
ly, neighborhood safe-cracker to 
go after some necessary link? I 
don't know especially as it isn’t 
his money, but his mother-in- 
law’s.” 

“1 don’t know either,” answered 
Jake, “but I alw-ays assume that 
my opponent might cheat if 1 fail 
to cut the cards. I’m going after 
that evidence with all possible 
speed. Sorry, Joan, I should have 
anticipated this — I’m getting old.” 
(He is not. Tell him so. Boss.) 

Joan Eunice patted his hand. 
“Jake, you are not getting old and 
there was no reason to anticipate 
this. Gentlemen, let me say again, 
I don’t care a whit if my grand- 
daughters win. If they win, they 
lose because if they prove me 
legally dead, I have cut them off 
with that shilling. And, thanks to 
Eunice Branca and Dr. Boyle and 
Jake Salomon, I’m young and 
healthy and enjoying life and not 
distressed at the idea of losing a 
fortune that has become a burden 
to me.” 

Alec Train said, “Brother 
Schmidt Joan Eunice honey, don’t 
you realize that it is uriAmurrican 
to talk that way about millions of 
dollars?” 

She grinned at him. “Brother 
Alec, if 1 come out of this broke. 
I’ll bet you a million dollars that 1 
can net a million dollars after 
taxes in the next five years, start- 
ing from scratch. Jake, will you 
back my bet? Since it calls for me 
starting broke?” 

“Certainly.” 

“Wait a minute!” Train pro-

tested. “I’m just a poor but hon- 
est lawyer. Will you make that 
bet fifty cents? Mac, will you lend 
me fifty cents?” 

“Not without security. .loan 
Eunice, listen, please. I don’t 
doubt that you are willing to tack- 
le the world broke. But I know in 
my heart that you are indeed 
Brother Johann Schmidt . who 
okayed a loan to me when I really 
needed it. Old Eata Bita Pi didn’t 
let me down . and I’m not going 
to let Brother Schmidt down.” 
“Thank you. Brother Mac.” 

Jake growled, “You frat house 
aristocrats made me sick when 1 
was in college and 1 don’t like it 
much better today. Judge, the only 
good reason for giving Joan Eu- 
nice a hand is because it’s the fair 
thing to do. Not because she —he 
okayed a loan years ago to 
some snot-nose fraternity broth- 
er.” 

“Counselor, your point is well 
taken. I think I can truthfully say 
that 1 have never allowed fraternal 
bonds including Shriner, which 
you and I are to affect my be- 
havior on the bench 

“The hell it hasn’t, old buddy 
mine; you rule against me just for 
the hell of it. Ask anybody.” 

“ — even when I’ve been forced 
to instruct this Irishman in the 
finer points of the law. I would 
have helped in this matter in any 
case; both as a citizen and as a 
ward of the court Joan Eunice is 
entitled to any help a court can of- 
fer in establishing her identity. But 
I confess that my emotions were 
aroused by a circumstance that I 
did not dream existed. Not that 
Joan Eunice is my fraternity

brother— that is simply a pleasing 
coincidence but that she — he at 
that time- gave me a hand when it 
mattered. Uh — ” stared at his 
glass— “no need to go into de- 
tails. You know them, Joan Eu- 
nice?” 

“Yes.” 

“You can tell Jake later. Let 
me list the things I think are nec- 
essary in this case; both of you 
lawyers check me and I’m going 
to stick a fresh tape in this thing 
so that we can all have copies.” 
He turned to his clerk’s record- 
ing equipment. “That is I think 1 
am going to. Damn! Excuse me, 
Joan Eunice. I wonder if Sperling 
has gone home.” 

(Let’s look at that thing, dear.) 
“I’m 'Brother Schmidt’ any time 
you feel like swearing. Judge. May 
1 look at your recorder? It’s a bit 
like one 1 have at home.” 

“Go ahead. 1 sometimes wish 
we still used shorthand reporters.” 
“Thank you.” (How about it, 
Eunice?) (It’s Betsy’s idiot baby 
sister, no huhu. You whistle Yan- 
kee Doodle or think about Judgie 
Wudgie and don’t bother me.) 
(Om Mani Padme Hum. Om Ma- 
ni Padme Hum. Om Mani Padme 
) (Got it, dearie.) “Recording 
with a fresh tape. Judge; set for 
three copies, and erase memory.” 

M cCAMPBELL said, “I’m 
amazed every time I find 
someone who understands ma- 
chinery.” 

“I don’t, really. But Eunice 
Branca taught me to run one 
somewhat like yours.” (Boss, 
you’re learning how to lie— just 
tell the truth but not all of it.)

(Honey girl, I invented that way of 
lying way back when your great 
grandmother was a virgin.) 

“First, Eunice Branca’s death 
must be established. As it was 
murder, we will assume extensive 
records with positive identification 
including fingerprints — and since 
they are police records, we must 
also assume that they are vulner- 
able to any determined and well- 
financed attempt to destroy or re- 
place them. Then Mrs. Branca’s 
body must be followed into sur- 
gery and positive identification of 
the body again established at that 
point. Johann Schmidt’s body 
must also be followed to that 
point and positively identified just 
before surgery. Then we must be 
certain beyond any doubt that the 
brain was removed from the 
Schmidt body — Joan Eunice, this 
must be distressing to you. Would 
you like to retire to my wash- 
room? There’s a couch in there.” 
“Please go ahead, sir; I’ve 
learned to live with it.” (Makes 
me feel like throwing up. Boss.) 
(Me, too, darling — but we aren’t 
going to; we’re going to look sol- 
emnly serene. Om Mani Padme 
Hum.) (Om Mani Padme Hum. 
Let’s make a lotus; this chair is 
big enough.) (Yes, darling. Om 
Mani Padme Hum.) 

“ — and finally, in court, we will 
take Joan Eunice’s fingerprints, 
have them compared by experts 
with each earlier set, and thereby 
forge the final link. Joan Eunice, 
do I simply switch this off now?” 
(After the three copies pop out, 
it will shut itself off.) “When the 
three copies pop out, it will erase 
and shut off. Jake, we’re keeping

these gentlemen from their fish- 
ing.” 

“Those'fish aren’t restless,” the 
judge assured her. “Just a mo- 
ment.” He stepped to his closed- 
circuit viewphone. “Evelyn.” 

“Yes, Judge.” 

“How are things outside? 
Quiet?” 

“Judge, how did you guess? I’ve 
got three men in the infirmary and 
the building is buttoned up. You 
might take a look on three and 
four, and then play back the six- 
teen o’clock spot news.” 

“How badly were your men 
hurt?” 

“Nothing serious. One with a 
lungful of sneeze gas when we had 
to clear the main entrance and seal 
the riot doors, one with a flesh 
wound on a cheekbone, and the 
third with cracked ribs. My guess 
is the newsies bought ’emselves a 
riot, as cameras were in position 
when the trouble started.” 

“I see. Are we going to need the 
Guard?” 

“I wouldn’t say so. The police 
have the streets around us pretty 
well patrolled and our own people 
are either staying overnight, or be- 
ing taken off the top by chopper. 
Message from Judge Anders — 
says there’s no reason for you not 
to go fishing and he’ll assume that 
he’s presiding judge pro tern. He’s 
staying in his chambers tonight.” 
“I’ll call him and thank him.” 
The judge switched to view three, 
studied it. “Doesn’t look too 
rough. Just the same they ought to 
tear this building down and build a 
stronger one farther from any 
Abandoned Area.” He switched to 
view four. “Oh-oh!” 



GALAXY 




The room filled with crowd 
roar, the screen showed a milling 
mob. Moving slowly through the 
crowd were two police Merrimac 
tanks, their loudspeakers monoto- 
nously repeating the warning-to- 
disperse. “Brother Schmidt, does 
your house have a copter land- 
ing?” 

Joan shook her head. “No, it’s 
designed so that a copter can’t 
land on it. It seemed the safer 
choice when it was built.” 

“Well ... I could put you into 
any enclave by copter. Or you 
could stay here overnight.” 

Jake said, “Judge, my car is a 
Rolls-Skoda. We’ll be all right.” 

“I can’t force you to stay. But 
let’s get a playback on the news 
and see what stirred up the lice.” 
McCampbell punched the time in, 
then punched for playback. 

H eadline of the Hour! Brain 
Transplant Fraud! Our earlier 
flash has been confirmed; the sen- 
sational brain transplant of Ty- 
coon Johann Smith was a hoax. 
The question is, did he die a na- 
tural death? Or was he murdered? 
The latter theory seems likely in 
view of today’s bald-faced attempt 
to steal his enormous fortune 
through claiming in open court 
that his alleged former secretary, 
a woman of doubtful reputation 
going by the name of ‘Blanca — ’ ” 
Salomon growled, “Judge, 
would you mind shutting off that 
damned rot?” 

McCampbell switched it off. 
“Seems I started something. Can’t 
say I’m sorry. I will not let my 
courtroom be turned into a cir- 
cus.” 



Joan Eunice said meekly, “I’m 
sorry. Judge.” 

“Eh? Joan Eunice, you are not 
at fault. You were forced into 
court needlessly and against your 
will; you did nothing. As for me, I 
hold to the old-fashioned ideal that 
a courtroom is where the Sover- 
eign is present in person, dispens- 
ing equity and justice to all . 
not bread-and-circuses for the rab- 
ble. As long as Tm on the bench 
I’ll run it that way, no matter how 
many news snoops get sore or how 
many illits want a livelier show.” 

“I’m sorry your bailiffs were 
hurt.” 

“Well, so am I. But they aren’t 
conscripts, they are career people 
who know it is hazardous. And 
they are necessary — if that bill 
ever passes to disarm bailiffs, that 
day I quit the bench . and the 
Law as well. Jake?” 

“Yes, Mac?” 

“You can risk your neck if you 
want to, but even a Rolls-Skoda is 
not a Merrimac. Enough people 
can tip it over, then they can build 
a bonfire around it and roast you 
like chestnuts . and there are 
characters out there who would do 
it just for kicks. No, not a word 
out of you; I’m not going to let 
her leave this building in a ground 
car even if I have to reconvene 
court for three seconds and make 
her a ward again. She leaves by 
copter. The question is, where does 
she go? You could sleep in my 
chambers, Joan Eunice; there is a 
buttery in the bar and the wash- 
room is a complete bath and that 
couch .opens into a bed. Lumpy, 
I’m afraid.” (Ask Judgie Wudgie 
if he goes with the bed!) (I didn’t

hear you — and now pipe down.) 

“I was going to say,” Jake said 
mildly, “that I have a house in 
Safe Harbor. Unstaffed and emp- 
ty but it’s a safe rendezvous. You 
could have your chief bailiff tell 
my driver and shotgun to wait un- 
til this quiets down, then pick us 
up there — although I would bet on 
those boys to drive through any 
mob and not let the car be tipped; 
they’re mean.” 

“No doubt. And wind up with a 
hit-and-run, too; we’ll do it the 
easy way. Either of you want to 
use my washroom while I phone 
Evelyn and the roof?” 

A few minutes later Jake and 
Joan were about to leave; the 
Judge’s copter was waiting for 
them, he having brushed aside re- 
marks about fish. Joan said, 
“Judge? I think you know 1 am 
grateful, but I would like to show 
my thanks by doing something — 
money, I mean -for those men 
who were hurt.” 

“No.” 

“Why not? Oh, I know it was 
not my fault but nevertheless they 
were hurt because of me. You 
know 1 can afford it.” 

“Because they are officers of 
the court and I would have to treat 
it as constructive bribery. Tell her 
Jake.” 

“He’s correct, Joan— although 
he’s being stuffy about it.” 

“Not too stuffy. Joan Eunice, 
there is an enclave home for de- 
pendents of police, bailiffs, fire- 
men, and such, killed in line of 
duty. Jake can tell you about it. 1 
would rather not hear what you do 
about it.” 

“1 see.” Joan ignored the fact 

160 



that Jake was waiting with her 
robe, stepped closer to McCamp- 
bell, turned her face up and put 
her arms around his neck. “Does 
this constitute bribery?” 

“I think so,” McCampbell an- 
swered, putting his arms around 
her. “But I won’t analyze it.” 

“Of course it’s bribery! Get 
away from him. Brother Schmidt! 
/ handle his bribes.” 

“Shut up, you noisy Mick.” 

Joan turned her face just as her 
lips were about to touch McCamp- 
bell’s. “You’re next on my bribe 
list. Brother Alec.” 

“So get back into line! R.H.I. 
P.” McCampbell stopped any 
further words from her; she let 
her lips come softly open, did not 
hurry him. (Whee . , ooo! 1 
thought so.) (Don’t let me faint, 
Eunice.) 

Some seconds later she opened 
her eyes, looked up into the 
judge’s face. “My goodness!” she 
said softly. 

Alec Train tapped his shoulder. 
“Court’s adjourned. Judge. Be 
elsewhere.” 

Joan gave the judge a quick, 
possessive squeeze, untangled her- 
self and went into his former 
roommate’s arms, turned up her 
face. She was careful to make this 
kiss as long and as warm as the 
other. (Unh! What do you think, 
Eunice?) (They are both oral as 
hell and they kiss almost as well 
as Jake and if Jake weren’t here 
they would have us down on the 
rug this instant — break it up, dear; 
you’ve kissed him as long as you 
did Judgie Wudgie and Jake is 
getting edgy.) (All right. Spoil- 
sport.) (Not at all but you don’t 

GALAXY 




know how to handle men without 
upsetting them. Break!) 

A MOMENT later Jake silently 
helped her into her street robe. 
She thanked him, clicked the mag- 
nos'trip, arranged the shoulder 
drape, let the judge hand her into 
his lift. They said goodbye, the lift 
closed. Alec Train turned to his 
friend; 

“Mac, kissing Brother Schmidt 
is more emphatic than spreading 
most gals.” 

“Amen!” 

“What would it be like to be 
married to her? And why is it that 
when the parade goes by I’m al- 
ways out for a short beer?” 

“The O.B. damaged your head 
with his forceps. That’s why they 
had to make a lawyer out of you.” 
“How about yourself?” 

“Oh, me, too — stipulated. I 
wasn't bright enough to be a law- 
yer; I had to wangle an appoint- 
ment to the bench. Christ, what a 
chick!” 

“Passed by acclamation. Mac, 
having kissed her, do you really 
think she can be old ‘Sell ’em Jo- 
hann,’ the terrible-tempered ty- 
coon?” 

“Well . everything fits — and 
she did have the Grip.” 

“And the password; I checked. 
But, Mac, any of our brothers, 
even ones whose bias hardly ex- 
tends to girls, would sell our se- 
crets — what am I saying — would 
give them to that one. If she 
kissed him.” 

“Stipulating that you are cor- 
rect in your estimate of our broth- 
ers — and 1 agree —Joan Eunice 
can’t have had much chance to 



subvert one of them. Jake has 
practically had her under house 
arrest, at my suggestion. And Jake 
himself — well, he sounded like a 
Barb, but you can check it in that 
bookcase, in ‘Who’s Who in 
Eaw.’ ” 

“I don’t think 1 can walk that 
far. But let’s assume that old Jo- 
hann was a brother - easy to check 
— and she did know all about the 
Distress Fund and the fact that 
you needed a loan our senior 
year.” 

“Yes. That’s the convincer.” 

“No, it’s not. I mean that Jo- 
hann would have been just as sus- 
ceptible. She was his secretary; it 
might have amused him to spill 
fraternal secrets to her--Grip, 
password, even details about the 
fund.” 

“Oh, crap, you honkie bastard. 
Joan Eunice is just what she pur- 
ports to be an utterly delicious 
girl who has Johann’s brain in her 
skull. Alec, I concede that Joan 
Eunice doesn’t seem much like Jo- 
hann Smith. But even you might 
be socially acceptable if that 
sponge between your ears were 
placed in the brain pan of a crea- 
ture as delectable as she is.” The 
judge shook his head. “She’s 
enough to make a queen switch 
from A.C. to D.C.” 

“Man, she really got to you, 
didn’t she?” 

“And you. my friend. Who said 
we needed a vacation from wom- 
en? You, as 1 recall. But you 
drooled over her. You would give 
up boys for life if she were to 
phone and ask for you. Don’t try 
to fool your roomie; I know you 
better than Ruth does.” 



I WILL FEAR NO EVIL

“I won’t argue. But you’re at 
least as far down the Street as 1 
am, Mac . and she affected you 
the same way. Uh, does Norma 
know how little fishing we plan to 
do?” . 

“Sure she suspects. But she’s al- 
ways been tolerant. Alec, how dis- 
appointed would you be if 1 called 
off our trip? Jake may need a 
friendly judge in a hurry. Espe- 
cially if those vultures find a shy- 
ster unscrupulous enough to buy 
some direct action. I’d hate to be 
missing if Brother Schmidt needed 
me.” 

“My God, a soul with a soul. 
Oddly enough I was thinking the 
same thing. Can’t let Brother 
Schmidt down. Mac, could it prej- 
udice anything if I volunteered my 
services — free- to Jake? If this 
gets sticky, he’s going to need to 
be several places at once. I could 
share the load.” 

“And share the wealth. It would 
give you an excuse to see Brother 
Schmidt again.” 

“.Any law against taking a prof- 
it? But Jake does need help.” 

“And you’re familiar with the 
case. Alec old dear, it’s a noble 
thought. While you did represent 
the petitioners, not only have they 
fired you, but this was never an 
adversary situation; theoretically 
those creeps are as anxious to ar- 
rive at the truth for the benefit of 
their beloved grandfather as Jake 
is. They don’t dare admit that they 
are trying to grab his gelt.” 

“I wonder if Jake has a phone in 
that empty house he mentioned? 
If not, I can leave word at the Gi- 
braltar Club- he has rooms there 
— and at Johann Smith’s town 

162 



house. And with Jake’s answering 
service.” 

“Yes. But let the call be from 
me; it might speed the service. 
We’ll stay and wait for it. Ruth’s 
not expecting you, Norma is not 
expecting me; I’ll have dinner sent 
up from the basement.” 

“Clear thinking. So fix fresh 
drinks while I put in those calls. 
Hey! You can reach them in your 
copter.” 

“Only via the piloting circuit. 
Not private. Better we keep this 
tight. Alec, it is unlikely that Jake 
will have anything for you to do 
before morning. But he might — a 
trip to the coast or such. You 
could stay on call by spending the 
night here.” 

“Well!” Alec Train stopped with 
his hand near the phone. “Room- 
ie, I thought that Brother Schmidt 
had driven all other thoughts out 
of your mind. Or did I misunder- 
stand?” 

“Let’s phrase it this way: It 
would be pleasant to discuss 
Brother Schmidt in intimate detail 
with some sympathetic person who 
appreciates her as much as I do.” 

“In that case, mix those drinks 
and start a lukewarm shower. I’ll 
join you as fast as I can.” 

XIV 

J AKE SALOMON handed Joan 
Eunice into the Judge’s copter, 
got in beside her and locked the 
door. Quickly they were airborne. 
The passenger compartment was 
separate from the pilot’s space and 
well soundproofed; conversation 
was possible. But he said nothing 
and kept his eyes away from her. 

GALAXY 




Joan let it go on only a short 
time. “Jake dear? Are you angry?” 
“Eh? Heavens, no. What made 
you think so?” 

“Yqu seemed quite distant. I 
thought you might be annoyed 
with me for having kissed Judge 
McCampbell and dear Mr. Train.” 
“Your business.” 

“Oh, Jake. Please don’t scold 
me even by your manner. I’ve had 
a difficult day, especially the time 
1 had to spend with my goddam 
granddaughters. It hurts, Jake, to 
be hated. To know that someone 
wants you dead. Yet I had to try 
to appear serene and ladylike. Be 
a credit to Eunice. Jake, it isn’t 
easy to be a lady — after almost a 
century of being male. Do you 
know how I manage it at all? 1 say 
to myself, ‘What would Eunice 
do?’— then I try to do it. Kissing 
those sweet and helpful men— - 
Jake, I’m not used to kissing men. 
You could have trained me but 
you won’t give me more than a 
good-night peck. I said to myself, 
‘1 must thank them — and what 
would Eunice do?’ I decided that 
she would kiss them the best she 
knew how. So I tried, even though 
I don’t know how. Well? Is that 
what Eunice would have done?” 
“Well . yes, Eunice would 
have kissed them.” (He knows 
darn well I would have, dear.) (1 
know. He’s being difficult.) (So 
keep punching. Tell him how won- 
derful he is. Joan, men always be- 
lieve it when you tell them they 
are wonderful.) 

“Then I don’t see why you are 
being cold with me, Jake. I thought 
you were truly wonderful all day 
long, the way you handled things 

I WILLFEAR NO EVIL 



and protected me. I wanted to kiss 
you for being so wonderful — and 
would have, and will! — if only you 
would let me. Was it because I 
didn’t stop to put my robe on be- 
fore 1 kissed them?” 

“Well ... it would have been 
more ladylike.” 

(Punch hard on this one, dearie 
— for Jake knows darn well that I 
spread skin on him the very first 
time I kissed him . and later I 
kissed him bare naked the first 
time it was safe to. He didn’t fight 

he was eager.) (I’ll try.) 

Miss Smith looked worried, 
which did not suit her features. “I 
suppose so. But I don’t know how 
to be a lady, Jake; the rules have 
changed so much. Eunice often 
startled me by what she did and 
how she dressed — yet I am certain 
that she was always a perfect lady. 
Tell me this, Jake, honestly and 
candidly, and I’ll treat your an- 
swer as Gospel and use it as a 
yardstick for future behavior — be- 
cause I do want to be a credit to 
Eunice; I want ‘Joan Eunice’ to 
be the perfect lady that Eunice 
was. Under those exact circum- 
stances and being just as anxious 
to show appreciation to two sweet 
and wonderfully helpful gentlemen 
. would Eunice have put this 
street robe on first? Or would she 
have spread her sweet skin on them 
and let them cuddle her a bit if 
they wanted to — and they wanted 
to. I’m sure you noticed. Think 
about it, Jake. You knew Eunice 
better than I did; we know that — 
so give me a straight answer, be- 
cause I’m going to use it as a 
guide in trying to be Eunice. 
Would she have played safe? Or 



163 




would she have given herself?” 
Jake Salomon gave a sigh that 
was almost a groan. “Hell, you 
did exactly what Eunice would 
have done. That’s what upset me.” 
Joan sighed. “Thank you, Jake, 
1 feel better.” She loosened her 
seat belt, moved closer to him, ran 
her thumb down the magnostrip of 
her robe. “Can’t get this pesky 
thing off in here. Kiss me, Jake, 
kiss me better than they did. Kiss 
me and cuddle me and tell me that 
Eunice would be proud of me.” 
“Joan!” 

“Don’t shame me, Jake. I’m a 
girl now and I need to be kissed so 
hard we’ll forget I kissed those 
other two. Call me Eunice, dear; 
please do — it’s my name and I 
want to hear you call me by it and 
tell me I’m a good girl.” 

He groaned. “Eunice!” 

She turned her face up. “Kiss 
me, darling.” 

Trembling, he gave in. 

The kiss went on and on. It took 
Joan only seconds to turn it from 
tender to rugged, nor did he hold 
back. (Eunice? I’m going to faint.) 
(I’m not going to let you, sweet- 
heart; I’ve waited a long time for 
this!) 

Eventually Jake broke, but she 
stayed close and he continued to 
hold her. She sighed and touched 
her hand to his face. “Thank you, 
Jake dear- for this, and for every- 
thing.” 

“Thank you . Eunice. Joan 
Eunice.” 

“Let me be Eunice a while long- 
er. Am I a good girl? Do I do 
credit to her?” 

“Uh . , yes!” 

“I tried. Jake dear, do you be- 
lieve in ghosts? I think Eunice 

164 



must have been here with us. I 
couldn’t have done that well with- 
out her help. It often seems so.” 
“Uh, it’s an interesting 
thought.” (Hmmph! We ought to 
tickle him for that. Joan, if you 
tickle him under his short ribs, he 
comes unstuck. Helpless.) (I’ll re- 
member. But not today.) “In any 
case, she would have been proud 
of you. You’re a sweet girl.” 

“I mean to be. To you. 1 love 
you, Jake.” 

He hesitated only a heartbeat. 
“I love you — Eunice. And Joan 
Eunice.” 

“I’m glad you made it both of 
us. Jake, dearest, you’re going to 
have to marry me. You know 
that, don’t you?” 

“What? Oh, heavens, dear, don’t 
be silly. I love you but there’s 
too much age difference.” 

“What? Oh, fiddlesticks! I know 
I’m almost a quarter of a century 
older than you are. But it no long- 
er shows. And you understand me 
and no other man possibly could.” 
"Huh! I mean I am too much 
older than you.’’ 

(Joan, don’t let him talk that 
way! Tell him men and liquor im- 
prove with age. Or some such. 
Anyhow, he was feeling quite 
young a few minutes ago — I no- 
ticed. Did you?) (Yes. Now quiet, 
please.) 

**¥AKE, you are not old. Good- 
J ness, I know what ‘old’ is! 
You’re a classic, Jake — and class- 
ics improve with age. And . just 
minutes ago, you were feeling 
quite young. I noticed.” 

“Uh . possibly. But none of 
your sass — youngster.”

She chuckled. “Jake, it’s nice to 
be a girl to you. I won’t argue. I’ll 
wait. In time you will realize that 
you need me and I need you, and 
that no one else will do for either 
of us. Then you can make an hon- 
est woman of me.” 

“Harrumph! That might be 
more than I could manage, even 
with a marriage license.” 

“Rude darling. I can wait. You 
can’t escape me, Jake. Eunice 
won’t let you.” 

“Well . I’m durned if I’ll ar- 
gue; it would just make you stub- 
born. In either of your personae.' 
My old friend Johann was as stub- 
born a man as I’ve ever met - and 
Eunice was just as stubborn in her 
own sweet way. And, dear, I never 
know which one you are. Some- 
times I think you’ve acquired that 
split personality your doctors were 
afraid of.” 

(Get him off this subject!) (1 
will, dear - but not by being jumpy 
about it. Aren't we ever going to 
tell him?) (Yes, of course. But not 
soon, Joan. Not till we’re in the 
clear. Remember those straps.) 
“Jake darling, Tm not surprised 
that you feel that way about me — 
because I do myself. Oh, nothing 
psychopathic, just the odd situa- 
tion I am in. You’ve known me 
how long? A quarter century.” 
“Twenty-six years, pushing 
twenty-seven.” 

“Yes. And while I was never 
given to copping feels from fe- 
male employees — would you say 
that ‘horny old bastard’ was an 
honest description of me?” 

“I’ve never known your behav- 
ior toward women to be other 
than gentlemanly.” 



“Oh, come now, Jake! You’re 
talking to Johann at the moment. 
Level with me.” 

Salomon grinned. “Johann, I 
think you were a horny old bas- 
tard right up to the day we took 
you in for surgery.” 

“That’s better. Years after I was 
benched in the matter . first for 
social reasons, the fact that an old 
man looks a fool if he behaves like 
a young stud, and later through ill- 
ness and physical incapacity — 
years after 1 was benched my in- 
terest in a pretty face or a pretty 
leg was unflagging. Then I ac- 
quired Eunice’s healthy young 
body. Female. Look at me Jake. 
Female.” 

“I’ve noticed!” 

“Not the way / have! Even 
though you’ve kissed me— a real 
kiss and I loved it, dear — you can’t 
have noticed the way I have been 
forced to. I’m cyclic now, Jake, 
ruled by the Moon; I’ve men- 
struated twice. Do you know what 
that means?” 

“Eh? Natural phenomenon. 
Healthy.” 

“It means that the body con- 
trols the brain as much as the 
brain controls the body. I'm tem- 
pery and inclined to tears just be- 
fore my period. My feelings, my 
emotions, even my thoughts are 
female- -yet I have almost a cen- 
tury of male emotions and atti- 
tudes. Take my pretty little nurse- 
companion, Winnie — and would 
you like to take her?” 

“Uh . damn you, Johann! 
She’s a nice girl. Fifth Amend- 
ment.” 

“She is indeed a nice girl. But 
because I’m Eunice as well as Jo- 



I WILL FEAR NO EVIL

hann. I know how she feels. She’s 
as female as a cat in heat — and 
you’re an old bull, Jake, and dom- 
inant, and if you wanted to take 
Winnie she wouldn’t put up more 
than token resistance.” 

“Joan Eunice, don’t talk non- 
sense. I’m three times her age.” 
(Boss, what are you getting at?) 
(I’m not sure but I’m getting 
there.) (Well, don’t get Winnie 
knocked up on the way. I thought 
we were saving Jake for us.) (Don’t 
be a pig, little piglet. Winnie’s a 
nurse; she sees to her contras as 
carefully as she cleans her teeth.) 
“Jake, dear. I’m not much older 
than Winnie in my body . and 
you’ve known and loved this body, 
even though I have no memory of 
it. We know that Eunice was al- 
ways a lady — so how did you ever 
manage to get started with her? 
Did you rape her?” (Hell, no, / 
raped him — but he was a push- 
over.) 

“That’s a most unfair ques- 
tion!” 

<<IT’S a very female question. 

1 Knowing you from many 
years of association — and know- 
ing Eunice both from some years 
of association but most important- 
ly from now having her body and 
glands and hormones and deepest 
emotions — I suspect that you were 
far too proud to make a pass at 
her so she found some way to 
make clear that you were wel- 
come. Once you were certain that 
Eunice was not trying to make a 
fool of you — that settled it. Well? 
Am I right?” (If he says No, he’s 
lying. It took five minutes. Sis — 
and would have been all over in 

166 



ten but we were interrupted. Had 
to wait till next day. Remember 
the mermaid getup? Had to scrub 
it off before I went home; Jake 
and I ruined it — and I had to tell 
Joe a sincere fib.) (Did he believe 
you?) (I think so. He was painting 
. which means he hardly noticed 
anything else.) 

“Jake, are you going to an- 
swer? Or let me draw my own 
conclusions — possibly mistaken?” 

“I could answer that it’s none 
of your business!” 

“And you would be right and 
Johann apologizes. But not Eu- 
nice. Jake, that’s what Eunice’s 
body tells me must have happened. 
But I can’t be certain and I do 
want to be like her and if that is 
not what she would have done be- 
cause it is not what she did — then 
tell me. I’m not asking for inti- 
mate details.” (Aw, get the juicy 
parts, dearie — I want to knowhow 
it seemed to him, every sweaty de- 
tail. I already know how it seemed 
to me — and I’ll tell you.) (Don’t 
be so right-now, darling— I’m try- 
ing to gentle him.) 

“Joan Eunice — no, Eunice! You 
always have had the damnedest 
way of getting your own way.” 

“Is that an answer, Jake? I don’t 
have Eunice’s memory.” (Says 
who? Boss, I’ve figured out some- 
thing — and it’s not flatworms. Ev- 
eryone has erasable memory and 
non-erasable memory, just like 
Betsy — and that non-erasable part 
is the me that’s still here now that 
I’m dead. ‘Soul’ maybe. Names 
don’t matter; it’s the part that’s 
not just glands and plumbing.) 
(Save the philosophy until we’re 
alone in bed tonight, Eunice; I’m 

GALAXY 



trying to cope with a man — and 
it's heavy going.) (Do you think 
we’re going to be alone in bed to- 
night? Want to bet?) (I don’t know 
- -and I’m scared.) (Don’t be 
scared. When it happens, you re- 
cite the Money Hum and I'll drive. 
Once around the course and you'll 
be ready to solo. Except that I'll 
always be with you. Know sump- 
in, Boss honey? It’s even nicer to 
be you than it was to be your sec- 
retary. Or will be, once we’re back 
on ground rations.) (Huh?) (Soul 
talk, dear means sex. 1 had it for 
fourteen years — and I’m hungry.) 
(I had it over five times that long 
I’m at least five times as hun- 
gry.) (Could be — you’re a horny 
bitch. Boss.) 

J AKE finally answered, “Joan, I 
don’t think it’s fair to Eunice’s 
memory for me to tell tales about 
her — but I'll concede your point, 
assuming that you want to learn, 
for your own guidance, as much 
as possible about how she behaved. 
Eunice was honest and straightfor- 
ward — ’’ (I’m devious as a snake 
but that’s what I wanted Jake 
to believe.) “and she apparently 
decided that she liked me that 
much . and made it easy for me. 
It was neither rape nor seduction.’’ 
(It was both, but 1 did not want 
him to think so. He’s a darling, 
Joan. When he’s gentled enough 
slip the bit into his mouth. But let 
him think he asked for it.) (I’ll 
try. Meantime I’m still doing this 
emotional strip-down — and you 
listen instead of interrupting; you 
might learn someting about me.) 
(I’ll be good. Boss. Mostly.) 

“I felt certain that it must have 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



been that way, Jake knowing 
you, knowing her. But that’s only 
one side of me as I am now —the 
‘Eunice’ side. The other side is 
Johann, with almost a century of 
male orientation. 1 told you I now 
understand Winnie, as a girl — be- 
cause now 1 am a girl. But there is 
still Johann, alone with Winnie 
every day- and it’s all 1 can man- 
age to keep my hands off her.” 
(Hmmph! You don't keep your 
hands off her.) (I said. Shut up! I 
haven’t let it get past heavy cud- 
dle. If you and I ever stroll Gay 
Street, you shameless, mermaid, it 
will be dessert, not the piece de re- 
sistance.) (That piece won't resist!) 
(Hush up!) Do you understand, 
Jake? Old Johann- wc.' -thinks 
that Winnie is quite some dish.’’ 

“Well ... I understand it in 
Johann.’’ 

“I wonder if you would under- 
stand it in Eunice? Jake, how do 
you feel about homosexuality?’’ 

“I don’t feel anything about it. 
Never been interested.’’ 

“Not even curious? Jake, Tm a 
full generation older than you are. 
When I was a kid, homosexuality 
or ‘perversion’ as it was called, 
was hardly even a myth; I never 
heard of it until long after 1 was 
centered on girls. Oh, I don’t mean 
there wasn't any; I know now that 
there was, lots of it. But it was 
spoken of seldom and kept under 
cover. When I was fifteen, a man 
made a pass at me - and 1 didn't 
know what he was after; he just 
scared me. 

“Would a fifteen-year-old boy 
today be that innocent? You know 
he wouldn’t be; there are books 
and magazines and pictures— and 

167 




other boys — to make certain that 
he understands even if he doesn’t 
join in. The government just miss- 
es endorsing it as a way to hold 
down our outlandish overpopula- 
tion — would endorse it openly, I 
feel sure, if it were not that a large 
percentage disapprove of it pub- 
licly while practicing it in private. 
It reminds me of that weird period 
in my youth when people voted dry 
and drank wet and the bootlegger 
was more sought after than the 
black-market butcher is today. 
How long has it been since the last 
‘sex offense’ was prosecuted?” 

“Rape by violence is still prose- 
cuted; I can’t recall any others in 
the last twenty years. Blue laws 
about sex are dead letters; Su- 
preme Court decisions have made 
them impossible to prosecute. 
Correction; unlicensed pregnancy 
is a Federal offense under the 
‘General Welfare’ clause . but 
I’ve often wondered what would 
happen if a case were ever allowed 
to reach the Supreme Court.” 

“That’s the only ‘sex crime’ that 
was not a crime when 1 was a kid, 
Jake. But I was talking about the 
‘crime against nature’ which is no 
longer a crime; it isn’t even a pec- 
cadillo, it arouses less disapproval 
than smoking. However by the 
time homosexuality was socially 
acceptable, my attitudes were long 
frozen. But I wonder what Eunice 
thought about it? Did you ever 
discuss it with her?” 

Jake snorted. “Believe me, Jo- 
hann— sorry, Joan Eunice — that 
was not a subject we had time 
for!” 

“I suppose not. Nor did she dis- 
cuss it with me.” (Eibber!) “But 



she gave me a gentle reprimand 
about it once.” 

“So? How?” 

“Oh, one day before I was bed- 
fast, a messenger delivered some- 
thing to my office. He was a real 
nancy-pants — lots of makeup, 

false eyelashes, curled hair, and he 
waved his hips. A high, girlish lisp 
and oh, so graceful in his gestures. 
After he was gone I made some 
intolerant remark and Eunice told 
me gently that, while she didn’t 
find such one-way boys attractive, 
she didn’t see anything wrong in a 
man’s loving man or a woman’s 
loving a woman.” (Hey! I don’t 
remember any such conversation.) 
(So I’m a liar. But you could have 
said it--and I’m making a point.) 

“Yes, that sounds like Eunice. 
She was tolerant of people’s frail- 
ties.” 

“My point is that, Eunice being 
the age she was, she was certain to 
be indifferent to — perhaps I should 
say understanding about what Jo- 
hann thought of as perversities. 
But here’s what I’m getting at, 
Jake: I find Winnie sexually at- 
tractive. I also find Alec Train 
and Judge McCampbell sexually 
attractive. Startled me. And you 
— which did not startle me. But 
today was the first time 1 have 
been thoroughly kissed by very 
male men. And I liked it. Shook 
me.” (How about dear Doctor?) 
(None of your lip, sweet lips — we 
don’t tell Jake that one.) 

J OAN EUNICE went on, “There 
is my dilemma. Which time am 
I being homosexual? With Win- 
nie? Or with you three very male 
bulls?”

“Joan, you ask the damnedest 
questions.” 

“Because I’m in the damnedest 
situation a man ever found himself 
in. I’m not the ordinary sex' change 
of a homo who gets surgery and 
hormone shots to tailor his male 
body into fake female. I’m not 
even a mixed-up XXY or an 
XYY. This body is a normal fe- 
male XX. But the brain in it has 
had a man’s canalization and many 
years of enthusiastic male sex ex- 
perience. So tell me, Jake, which 
time am I being normal, and which 
time perverse?” 

“Uh . I’m forced to say that 
your female body controls.” 

“But does it? Psychologists 
claim that sexual desire and or- 
gasm take place in the brain — not 
in the genitals. My brain is XY.” 

“I think you are trying to con- 
fuse the witness.” 

“No, Jake, I’m the one who is 
confused. But possibly not as con- 
fused as the young people today. 
You know they claim to have six 
sexes.” 

“Heard of it. Nonsense.” 

“Not entirely. I’ve been doii% 
lots of reading during my de-facto 
house arrest, trying to find out 
who I am, what I am, how I should 
behave. They label these so-called 
sexes both by behavior and physi- 
ology, with a new school of psy- 
chology — when wasn’t there a new 
one? — to account for them. The 
six are ortho-male, ortho-female, 
ambi-male, ambi-female, homo- 
male, homo-female — and some 
list a seventh, the solos or narcis- 
sists. Even an eight, the non-sex, 
the neuters, both physical and psy- 
chological.” 



“And I say it’s nonsense.” 

“I do, too, but not for the same 
reason. From my unique experi- 
ence, embracing both physiologi- 
cal sexes directly and not by hear- 
say, I say there is just one sex. 
Sex. SEX? Some people have so 
little sexual drive that they might 
as well be neuters no matter 
whether they are concave or con- 
vex. Some people have very strong 
sexual natures — and again the 
shape of the body doesn’t figure. 
Such as my former self, horny 
long after sex had abandoned me. 
Such as you, darling — taking a 
lovely young married woman less 
than half your age as your mis- 
tress. Such as Eunice- happily 
married at home, I think — ” 

“Yes, she was. I felt guilty 
about it.” 

“But not too guilty to share her 
riches. Jake, I wouldn’t speak to 
you if you had scorned her. I was 
about to name Eunice as my third 
example of a person strongly 
sexed. Enough sexual drive in her 
body — I know—foT anything. 
Enough love in her heart — I feel 
certain — for any number. I know 
she loved me, even though she was 
too warmly empathic to mock me 
by offering me what 1 could not 
accept -and did give me, lavishly, 
the only thing I could accept — 
her beauty, for my eyes. Jake, I 
think Eunice was limited in her 
love only by time. She kept you 
happy — ” 

“She certainly did!” 

“I’m just as certain she did so 
without depriving her husband. 
Jake, do you have reason to be- 
lieve that she limited herself to 
you — and her husband?” 



I WILL FEAR NO EVIL

“Uh - Damn you, Johann! I 
don’t know. But I don’t think she 
had time. Uh, I used up all the 
sneak-out time she could man- 
age.” 

(Look Boss, I’ll tell you about 
every time I struck a blow for 
equal rights. Don’t pester Jake.) 
(You're missing the point, Eu- 
nice. Em forcing Jake to move 
Saint Eunice off her pedestal 
that’s the only way we’ll ever get 
him.) 

“How do you know? Can you 
be sure she didn’t tell you the same 
sort of little white lies she told her 
husband? For that matter, Jake, 
Joe may have been as proud of his 
antlers as an old buck deer- the 
percentage of husbands who are 
pleased by their wives’ adulteries 
has been climbing steadily in this 
country at least since nineteen- 
fifty see any of the kinseys. That 
he loved her we both are certain. 
That does not prove he tried to 
keep her in a cage. Or wanted to.” 

“Joan, 1 would just as lief you 
didn’t run down Eunice to me.” 

“Jake, darling! 1 am not run- 
ning her down. I am trying to find 
out what you know about her, so 
that I can model myself more 
closely after her. I loved her — and 
love her still more today. But if 
you told me that you knew she 
was mistress to six other men, a 
whore on the side, and playing girl 
games in her spare time- well. I’ve 
never known you to lie to me, 
Jake, so 1 would try to go and do 
likewise. You haven’t told me 
much but what you have told me 
confirms what I believed —that 
Eunice was a perfect lady, with 
enough love in her heart to love 

170 



three men at once and give each of 
them exactly what he needed to 
make him happy.” (Thank you. 
Boss. Shall I bow?) (Quiet, little 
darling.) “But not a wanton, never 
a slut, and -while she wasn’t prud- 
ish- I doubt if Winnie would have 
interested her.” (Now wait one 
frimping minute!) (Em telling him 
what he wants to hear, dear if 
you want Winnie, we’ll keep it 
out of Jake’s sight.) {Who wants 
Winnie? You dirty old man!) (We 
both do but it may be smart 
never to let it hatch. Dearest, 
Winnie wouldn’t look at us with 
a man around.) (Want to bet?) 

J OAN sighed. “Jake, with my 
unique double inheritance it 
would be easy for me to turn am- 
bi-female. I'm not going to, be- 
cause I don't think Eunice would. 
With the deep female drive this 
body has- bloodstream brimming 
with hormones and gonads the size 
of gourds is the way it feels I 
could easily become ‘No-Pants 
Smith, the Girl Most Likely To.’ 
Very easily — as Johann Smith was 
an old vulgarian who regretted 
only the temptations he had been 
forced to pass up. But I’m not go- 
ing to do that, either, as Eunice 
did not behave that way. But if I 
don’t get married fairly soon, Em 
going to find it hard to stay off 
the tiles,” 

“Joan, I love you -but I am 
not going to marry you. It’s out 
of the question.” 

“Then you had better help my 
granddaughters to swindle me.” 
“Eh? Why?” 

“You know why. A multi-mil- 
lionaire who is young and female 

GALAXY 




stands as much chance of getting 
a good husband as the well-known 
tissue-paper dog had of chasing 
that asbestos cat through Hell. 
Lots of them in our country— 
and all they ever got were Geor- 
gian princes, riding masters, and 
other gigolos. I don’t want one, 
won’t have one. I’d rather be 
broke, like Winnie, and take what 
love I can find. Jake, besides the 
fact that you understand me and 
no one else can, you’d still be in 
my top ten because my money 
does not impress you. Quite aside 
from wonderful fact that 1 love 
you and you love me, any mar- 
riage broker would call us a per- 
fect match.” 

“Hardly. There’s still the mat- 
ter of age — body ages. Joan, a 
man who marries at my age isn’t 
taking a wife, he’s indenturing a 
nurse.” 

“Oh, frog hair, Jake! You don’t 
need one and I’ll lay even money 
that you’ll stay strong and virile 
right through my breeding period. 
But when you do need one I’ll 
nurse you. In the meantime we’ll 
sing September Song — you lead. 
I’ll harmonize.” 

“I sing bass. And 1 won’t sing 
September Song.” 

“Jake? We could buy you a new 
body. When you need it.” 

“No, Joan. I’ve had a long run 
and a good one, most of it happy, 
all of it interesting. When my time 
comes. I’ll go quietly. 1 won’t 
make the mistake you did, I won’t 
let myself fall into the hands of 
the medics, with their artificial 
kidneys and their dials and their 
plumbing. I’ll die as my ancestors 
died.” 



She sighed. “And you call me 
stubborn. I’ve taken you up on a 
high mountain and shown you the 
kingdoms of the earth — and you 
tell me it’s Los Angeles. All right. 
I’ll quit pestering you — and hum- 
bly accept any love you can spare. 
Jake, will you take me out on the 
town and introduce me to eligible 
young men? You can spot a for- 
tune hunter — I think Eunice may 
be too naive, too inclined to think 
the best of people.” (Rats, Boss, 
I bought me a gigolo with my 
eyes open . and, since I wasn’t 
kidding myself, I bought top qual- 
ity.) (1 know you did, darling — 
but the Joe Brancas in this world 
are as scarce as the Jake Salo- 
mons.) 

“Joan Eunice, if you want me 
to escort you. I’ll be honored . 
and I’ll try to keep pascoodnyaks 
away from you.” 

“I’ll hold you to that, you not- 
so-very-old darling. Jake, I asked 
if you believed in ghosts. Do you 
have any religion?” 

“Eh? None. My parents were 
Orthodox, I think you know. My 
Bar Mitzvah speech was so 
praised that I had to fight to study 
law instead of being trained as a 
rabbi. But I shook off all that be- 
fore I entered college.” 

“Parallels me, somewhat. My 
grandparents came from the south 
of Germany, Catholic. So the 
priests had a crack at me first. 
Then we moved to the middle 
west before I started school, and 
Papa, who was never devout, de- 
cided it would be better — better 
for business, maybe — to be a Bap- 
tist. So I got the Bible-belt rou- 
tine, with hell fire and damnation 



I WILLFEARNOEVIL

and my sins washed away with 
full immersion. It was the Bible- 
belt indoctrination that stuck, 
particularly the unconscious atti- 
tudes, 

“But, consciously and intellec- 
tually, I shucked off all of it when 
I was fourteen — probably the only 
real intellectual feat of my life. I 
became an aggressive atheist — ex- 
cept at home — and scorned to be- 
lieve in anything I could not bite. 
Then I backed away from that — 
atheism is as fanatic as any relig- 
ion and it’s not my nature to be 
fanatic — and became a relaxed 
agnostic, unsure of final answers 
but more patient. I stayed that 
way three-quarters of a century; 
I left religion to the shamans and 
ignored it.” 

“My own policy.” 

“Yes. But let me tell you some- 
thing that happened while I was 
dead.” 

“What? You were never dead, 
Joan — Johann, damn it — you were 
merely unconscious.” 

«T WASN’T, eh? With no body, 
•land my brain cut off from the 
world and me not even aware of 
myself? If that is not death, Jake, 
it is an unreasonable facsimile. I 
told you that I thought Eunice’s 
spirit has often given me a hand.” 

“I heard you. 1 ignored it.” 

“You stiff-necked old bastard. 
I haven’t taken up seances and 
such. But here is what happens. 
When I am in a quandary — often, 
these days — I ask myself, ‘What 
would Eunice do?’ That’s all it 
takes, Jake; I know at once. No 
ectoplasm or voices from a medi- 
um — just instant knowledge not 

172 



based on my own experience. Such 
as this afternoon when I decided 
in a split second to kiss Alec and 
Mac. No hesitation -you saw! 
That’s not the way old Johann 
would behave . and yet you tell 
me I haven’t missed behaving like 
Eunice even once. That’s why it 
feels as if her sweet spirit were 
guiding me. Any comment?” 

“Mmm . No. You do behave 
like her . other than when you 
tell me flatly that you’re speaking 
as Johann. But I don’t believe in 
ghosts. Johann, if I thought I had 
to go on being Jake Salomon 
throughout all eternity. I’d well, 
I would register a complaint at the 
Main Office.” 

“Let me tell you what happened 
to me at the Main Office.” 

“Huh?” 

“While I was dead, Jake. 1 was 
in this -place. There was a very 
old Man with a long white beard. 
He had a big book. He looked at 
me, then consulted His book, then 
looked back at me. He said, ‘Son, 
you’ve been a bad boy. But not 
too bad, so I’m going to give you 
another chance. Do your best and 
don’t worry; you’ll have help.’ 
What do you think, Jake?” (What 
is this, Boss? Did it happen to 
you, too?) (Eunice, if it happened 
to you it happened to me; it’s the 
same thing. And you are my help, 
beloved. My guardian angel.) (Oh, 
frimp you! Em no angel, I’m me.) 
(A very earthy angel, beloved 
darling — ^just what I need.) (Love 
you, too, you dirty old man.) 

Salomon answered slowly, “An- 
thropomorphism. Right out of 
your Bible-belt Sunday school.” 
“Oh, certainly. It had to be in

symbols I could understand. If I 
had been a creature from around 
Proxima Centauri the old Man 
and the beard might have been a 
Thing with eight tentacles and fa- 
ceted eyes. Cliche symbols are 
nothing against it; I’ve never 
thought it was a physical experi- 
ence. Men live by symbols, Jake. 
That — symbolic — experience was 
as real to me as any physical ex- 
perience. And allow me to point 
out that I do have a second chance 
and I have, and am having, lots of 
help — from you especially, from 
Mac and Alec, from doctors and 
nurses . and also from some- 
thing inside that tells me instant- 
ly, in any difficult situation, ex- 
actly how Eunice would handle it. 
1 don’t say it’s Eunice .♦. but it’s 
not Johann; he wouldn’t know 
how. Well?” 

Salomon sighed. “Of the in- 
venting of gods there is no end. 
And almost always anthropomor- 
phic. Joan, if you are going in for 
that sort of self-delusion, why not 
go whole hog and join a nun- 
nery?” 

“Because Eunice would not. 
Although she might enjoy revamp- 
ing a monastery.” 

Jake chuckled. “She might, at 
that.” 

“Maybe I should try it — since 
you are so damn chinchy about 
making me an honest woman. 
More likely I’ll change my name 
again and disappear and wind up 
in a crib in Bombay. Will you 
come visit me there, Jake?” 

“No. Too hot.” 

“Chinchy. Mean old Jake. You 
wouldn’t refuse to go see Eunice 
because of heat.” 



“Eunice would never wind up in 
a crib.” 

“No, she wouldn’t. So I have to 
go on being a lady even though 
it’s quite a strain on old Johann.” 
“.Poor you. All you have is 
youth, beauty, and half as much 
money as the I.R.S.” 

“And you, Jake. I could lose 
the rest and still be rich.” (I was 
wondering if you would see that 
opening. Sister, you don’t need 
my advice; I think I’ll take a va- 
cation.) (You promised to stay!) 
(Yes, Boss darling. I can’t leave; 
we’re Siamese twins. But even if 
I could. I’d stay because I want 
to.) (Eunice beloved, 1 have never 
been happier in my life.) Joan Eu- 
nice moved closer to Jake. “Jake, 
dear, 1 have never been happier in 
my life.” 

A brassy voice from the cock- 
pit said, “I am about to swing for 
landing. Please secure seat belts.” 
Salomon answered, “Seat belts 
fastened and now being tightened. 
Proceed with landing.” To Joan 
he said, “Straighten up, Eunice — 
and do snap up that magno.” 

Joan Eunice pouted her lip and 
obeyed. 

XV 

S ECURITY check took little 
time; Salomon was known to 
the enclave guards and the copter 
was expected. It was a short walk 
from the landing to Salomon’s 
house but, as in all upper-class 
enclaves, inhabitants in sight out- 
doors pretended not to see them. 
The door opened to Jake’s voice 
and again they were private. 

Joan Eunice took off her street 

173

robe and handed it to Jake, say- 
ing, “May I look around? Jake, 
it’s been years since I’ve been 
here; you’ve made changes.” 

“Some. Moved my personal 
gear to the Gib or to your house, 
not much left but furniture which 
I’ll sell with the house. Oh, 1 keep 
some clothing and toilet articles 
here, and I can find us a drink 
and a tin of biscuits. Perhaps 
smoked oysters or caviar; we 
have to kill an hour or two. Or 
I could send out for dinner.” 

“Let me see what there is in 
your kitchen; I would enjoy play- 
ing housewife. And I do want to 
look around.” 

“Look all you like, but tell me 
what you want to drink. Joan, 
have you ever been in a kitchen?” 
“None of your lip, lad; I’m a 
good cook. Mama taught me to 
make Apfelstrudel — dough you 
could read print through and so 
light it melted in your mouth — 
before you were born. Sherry, or 
a Dubonnet highball — no Schnaps, 
I’m not risking it yet.” 

“I’ll stack my kosher cooking 
against your Bavarian messes any 
day, girl. The Goyim can’t cook 
the way the Chosen People can.” 
“Oh, pooh, you fake Jew. You 
haven’t tasted my pot roast with 
noodles. I bached between wives 
and cooks — and mistresses, and 
I always cooked. Jake, wouldn’t 
it be fun to cook for each other 
and swap recipes? We could do 
it here. I don’t dare enter my 
own kitchen; Della would faint.” 
“Might be fun. We can eat my 
cooking when your boasts don’t 
pan out. Excuse me; I’ll see what 
liquor there is.”

Joan Eunice headed straight 
for the master bedroom. (Eunice, 
is this one of the places?) (Of 
course. See that sag in the bed? 
Boss, this is the only place we 
managed an all-night. Heavenly!) 
(All night? Then his mobiles do 
more than suspect; they know.) 
(Oh, they may suspect but it 
doesn’t matter. Charlie isn’t in- 
terested in women, and Rock- 
ford — well, he’s on my team. He 
approves of anything immoral, 
illegal, or dishonest — and my con- 
duct was all three, by his stan- 
dards. He’s an atavism. But the 
all-night — I doubt if they sus- 
pected. We used more fan-danc- 
ing to keep it out of their sight 
than Joe’s sight — things involv- 
ing two hired Brink’s cars and a 
non-existent errand for you.) 
(How did you fan-dance it for 
Joe?) (Didn’t. I thought up a story 
and told Jake I would use it — 
then told Joe that I had met a 
man I wanted to spend a night 
with . did he mind?) 

(As simple as that?) (Yes, Boss. 
We both were free but we were 
careful never to hurt each other. 
Only a second-class contract — 
since I was licensed for children 
and Joe was not. Either of us 
could have registered a dissolu- 
tion on three days’ notice.) 

(But what did Joe say?) 
(Nodded and went on painting. 
He kissed me goodbye and told 
me to have fun; Joe was always 
sweet. But he may not have 
missed me. He was painting from 
a new model, a beautiful boy who 
was a frimp type. Joe may have 
been changing his luck; he some- 
times did.) 



GALAXY 




(And you didn’t mind?) 

(That beautiful boy? Boss, 
you’ve got to move into the 
twenty-first century, now that 
you’re me. What possible harm? 
I’ve told you and told you that 
Joe and I were always careful of 
each other’s happiness; what more 
could I ask? Besides, I don’t know 
that Joe had his eye on him other 
than as a model but — well, if they 
had invited me to move to Troy 
with them, I wouldn’t have 
minded, for a night or two. I’ve 
always preferred older, men but 
the boy was pretty as a Palomino 
and clean as a sterilized cup; I 
wouldn’t have found it boring. 
Plus the fact that a woman is flat- 
tered if two males like her enough 
to let her watch what they do.) 

(Eunice my love, you continue 
to startle me. That angle 1 would 
never have thought of. Yes, I 
guess it would be a compliment, 
in a way. I think that men even 
men today -are shyer about such 
things than women are.) 

(Men are horribly shy, Boss- 
whereas women usually are not. 
W’e just pretend to be, when it’s 
expected of us. Look, a woman is 
a belly with a time bomb inside, 
and women know it and can never 
get away from it. They either quit 
being shy — no matter how they 
behave to please men - or they go 
crazy; it’s the choice we have to 
make. And high time you made 
that choice, dear. y\ccept your 
femaleness and live with it. Be 
happy.) (1 think I have.) (You’re 
coming along. But sometimes it 
feels like the bravado of a little 
boy who says, T am not either 
scared!’ when he’s ready to wet his 



pants, he’s so frightened.) (Well, 
maybe. But I’ve got you holding 
my hand.) (Yes, dearest. Mama 
will take care of vou.) 

Joan went into Jake’s bath- 
room, primarily to snoop. She 
had just found something she half 
expected to find — when she heard 
Jake’s voice. “Hey! Where are 
you? Oh! Coming, or going? 
Fixed you Chablis over ice” 

“That’ll do fine. Jake. Was this 
hers?” She held up a luxurious 
negligee — two ounces of cobweb. 
Jake gulped. “Yes. Sorry.” 

“I’m not sorry.” Suddenly 
Joan stripped off the Cling-Ons, 
shoved down her frill-skirt pan- 
ties and stepped out of them, 
leaving her bare from sandals to 
eyebrows, put on the negligee. 
“Do I wear it the way she would? 
Wups, I wrapped it man-style.” 
She rewrapped the lapover to the 
left. “Do I do her justice?” 

“Eunice! Eunice!” 

She folded it back, let it slither 
to the floor, went into his arms, 
let him sob against her face. 
“That’s enough, darling, Eunice 
doesn’t want you to cry. Eunice 
wants you to be happy. Both Eu- 
nice and Joan Eunice. Hold me 
tight, Jake. We’re lost and lonely 
- and all we have is each other.” 
While she cuddled him and 
soothed him, she opened the zip- 
down of his shirt. (Eunice, I’m 
scared!) (Easy does it, dear. Chant 
the Money Hum to yourself; I’ve 
taken over. Om Mani Padme 
Hum.) (Om Mani Padme Hum. 
Om M ani- ) 

J OAN was jerked out of it by 
the telephone signal. She pulled 

175 



I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 




her mouth from Jake’s and started 
to cry. “Oh, damn!” 

Jake said huskily, “Ignore it. 
It’s a mistake, no one knows I’m 
here.” 

“Uh — If we don’t answer, 
they’ll try again and interrupt us 
again. I’ll take care of it, dear. 
Where is the pesky thing? Living 
room?” 

“Yes, but there’s an extension 
over there.” 

“Keep thinking nice thoughts.” 
Joan hurried over, high heels tap- 
ping, stood close to the pickup so 
that only her face would be seen, 
flipped the switch — said in Eu- 
nice’s most crisp secretarial 
voice: “Mr. Salomon’s residence. 
Who is calling?” 

The screen stayed blank. “Re- 
corded. Urgent call for Counse- 
lor Salomon, third attempt.” 

“Urgency noted. Proceed. Who 
is calling?” 

Another voice came on, screen 
still blank. “This is Mr. Salo- 
mon’s answering service. Judge 
McCampbell has placed an ur- 
gent call. I told the judge that the 
counselor was more likely to be 
at his club or at the Johann Smith 
residence, but he insisted that 1 
keep trying this code, too. Is he 
there?” 

“One moment.” Joan glanced 
back, noted with annoyance that 
Jake had closed his shirt and 
picked up her clothes. “I have 
Mr. Salomon. Can you reach 
Judge McCampbell? I will hold.” 

“Thank you. One moment.” 

Joan stepped still closer and 
tilted the pickup to make certain 
that it caught only her face. Jake 
stepped to her, handed her her 

176 



clothes. She accepted them, did 
not put them on. 

The screen lighted. “Jake, we — 
Hey! Brother Schmidt!” 

“Alec! How nice!” 

“Step back so I can see you, 
dear. Mac, don’t shove,” Train 
added as the judge’s face ap- 
peared by his in the screen. “Is 
Jake there?” 

“Right beside me, boys.” 

“All 1 can see is his shirt. Stand 
on a box, honey, so that you’re 
both on screen; this must be a 
four-way conference. Or back 
away.” 

“Here he is.” Joan tilted the 
pickup higher, reluctantly pressed 
the cups to her breasts, stepped 
into her frill-skirt, wiggled it into 
place. Then she backed off. “Can 
you see me now?” 

“Not well enough,” the judge’s 
resonant baritone answered. 
“Jake, back off a little. Joan, you 
need a stool. Better yet, Jake, 
hold her up in your arms — you 
lucky man.” 

“What’s the message, gentle- 
men? And, thank you. Judge, for 
your flitter. We were delivered 
quickly and safely.” 

“De nada, compadre. Jake, my 
old roomie got a brilliant idea — 
no doubt through long associa- 
tion with me.” The judge ex- 
plained what each was willing to 
do in order to speed confirmation 
of Joan’s identity. “This can be 
our comm center. I am going to 
live in my chambers a few days — 
ready to issue a warrant, phone a 
judge in another jurisdiction or 
whatever. Then we’ll rush it 
through my court and crowd them 
into an appeal — get this nailed

down tight. Meanwhile Alec is 
your man Friday. Want him to 
go anywhere in a hurry? He’s stu- 
pid but healthy, and losing a 
night’s sleep to time-zone changes 
is good for him.” 

“Probably not before morning. 
But I’m relieved, gentlemen; I’ve 
been wondering how I could be 
everywhere I need to be. Since 
I’m retired from everything but 
Joan’s personal affairs. I’m with- 
out staff — and I’ve been cudgel- 
ing my brain trying to think 
whom 1 could get who would be 
reliable and competent. As we all 
know, this is touchy.” 

“We know!” agreed Alec. 
“And we’re going to fix those 
harpies — aren’t we, Mac?” 

“Yes — but legally and so that it 
cannot be reversed, Jake. You can 
reach us here — and don’t hesitate 
to wake us if you decide you want 
Alec to catch a midnight liner. 
Where will you be? Your house?” 
“Until my car arrives, then 
we’ll be at Joan’s. Or on our way. 
My answering service can flip you 
into my car’s wavelength. It’s a 
longish drive.” 

“We’ll be in touch. Don’t wor- 
ry, Jake, and don’t let Joan wor- 
ry. We’ll have her baptized before 
you can say ‘missing heir.’ ” 

“I’m not worried,” said Joan, 
“but I feel like crying. Boys — 
Brothers — how can I thank you?” 
“Shall we tell her, Mac? Would 
she blush? Thank me, that is, 
Brother Schmidt; don’t thank 
Brother Mac; he’s just doing his 
duty, what the taxpayers reluc- 
tantly pay him for. But you can 
thank me — I’m a volunteer.” 

“I’ll thank you both, in what- 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



ever way you wish,” Joan said 
simply. 

“You heard that, Mac? Broth- 
er Schmidt committed herself — 
and you can’t break a promise 
between Brothers, that’s the old 
Bita Pi law. Brother Schmidt 
Joan Eunice honey, back off and 
let us see all of you. Jake, get 
out of pickup; you ruin the com- 
position. Go have a beer. Take a 
nap.” 

“Ignore him, he’s drunk,” ad- 
vised his former roommate. 

“So’s Mac, we’ve been work- 
ing on it. But I’m not too drunk 
to hop a guided missile, Jake, if 
you say to.” 

“Jake,” said the judge, “this is 
getting out of hand. Not that I 
disagree with this low forehead’s 
enthusiasm. Good night, sir. Good 
night, Joan. Off.” 

Joan Eunice flipped the switch, 
made certain that the screen was 
dead, started undressing. 

“Joan. Stop that.” 

S HE went on removing her 
saucy, scanty clothing, heeled 
off her sandals, then stood facing 
him. “Jake, 1 refuse to be treated 
like a porcelain doll. You had me 
expecting to be treated as a wom- 
an.” 

He sighed. “I know. But the 
golden moment passed.” 

“Well . I’m not going to 
dress. You’ve seen this body many 
times, we both know — and I want 
us both to get easy about it. Ac- 
tually I’m shy, Jake; I’m only 
weeks old, as a woman, and not 
used to it. But 1 want to get used 
to it. With you.” 

“Well — As you wish, dear; you 

177 






178 



know how beautiful I think you 
are. What shall we do? Read aloud 
to each other till my car arrives? 
Watch video?” 

“Beast. If you were a gentle- 
man you would at least take your 
clothes off. Instead you are a dif- 
ficult, stubborn beast Snd I don’t 
know wby I love you. Except that 
Eunice loved you — loves you, 
wherever she is — so I have to love 
you. Jake, if you won’t take me 
to bed, at least sit down in that 
big chair and let me crawl up in- 
to your lap. We can talk. We’ll 
talk about Eunice.” 

He sighed. “Girl, you’ll give 
me a heart attack yet. .All right, 
come curl up in my lap. On one 
condition.” 

“Jake, I’m not sure I’ll agree 
to any conditions. I’m in a very 
unstable state.” 

“You certainly are, dear. But 
it’s my lap. No ticky, no washee.” 
“I should go back to the court- 
house; 1 don’t think Mac and Alec 
would insist on conditions. Might 
as well relax, Jake; I’m climbing 
into your lap with no more yat- 
ter. There! That’s better. Arms 
around me, please.” 

“First the condition. That you 
not try to rape me in a chair— ” 
“Don’t think 1 could.” 

“You’d be surprised what can 
be done in a chair, Joan.” 

“Would not. I’ve done ’em all. 
As Johann. But they require co- 
operation.” 

“Mmm, so they do. -and that, 
as soon as my car arrives, you 
dress at once and no nonsense, 
and we go home.” 

“All right — since you made that 
‘we.’ I was afraid you were feeling 

GALAXY 




ornery enough to send me home 
alone. In which case I was going 
to have Rockford and Charlie 
take me straight back to Alec and 
Mac. Aren’t they delightful 
wolves, Jake? Hold me tight. The 
only way you can protect me from 
them is you-know-what.” 

“Hmm. Joan, can you keep a 
chuckle to yourself?” 

“Well ... I promise never to 
tell anyone but Eunice.” 

“Eh? Okay, 1 don’t think you 
would break a promise made that 
way. But, let me add that if you 
did tell, it would hurt Alec and 
Mac both — and Eunice would not 
like that.” 

“No, Eunice certainly would 
not like that. Jake, you’re going 
to be able to hogtie me with that 
phrase the rest of my life.” (Don’t 
fret. Boss honey. Any time Jake 
is wrong. I’ll give you the ammo 
to change his tune.) “All right. 
I’ll tell no one but Eunice — and 
the old Man with the long white 
beard next time I see Him.” 

“Safe enough. Okay, here’s the 
chuckle. Your two charming 
wolves — and they are charming — 
are as gay as Julius Caesar.” 

“What? Jake, I have trouble 
believing that.” 

“I won’t offer proof but I as- 
sure you that I know it beyond 
any reasonable doubt.” 

“But — Look, dear, I’ve kissed 
them. I may be an ersatz female 
. but not where it matters, and 
I know those kisses weren’t phony. 
They were hot over me. Shucks, 
darling, I could tell it by Braille. 
Besides, they are married.” 

“I said, ‘As gay as Julius Cae- 
sar,’ not Governor Arkham.” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 





“Oh. Ambi gay, you mean. I 
still have trouble believing it. 
Doesn’t it show at all? Even in a 
kiss?” (/ spotted it, Joan, the po- 
tential at least. But they’re still 
wolves . and we may be back 
there some day. To thank them.) 
(Eunice, is that the only way a 
female can thank a man?) (That’s 
the only convincing way, twin. 
This is news?) (No, beloved — but 
it was possible that your genera- 
tion had learned something mine 
had not. They haven’t. Not in any- 
thing you’ve told me. Just more 
open about it.) 

“Joan, there is no way to spot 
it, if an ambi does not want it 
known. Either ambi, or clear over 
the line and no return. Look, 
when you were Johann, could you 
spot a virgin?” 

“Jake, I’m not sure I ever met 
a virgin. But you have.” 

“You must mean someone we 
both know.” 

“Of course.” 

“Who? Winnie? Wouldn’t have 
thought so. But she does blush 
easily.” 

“Not Winnie. If she is one, I 
didn’t have her in mind.” (You 
crawled out of that one!) (Winnie 
can tell her own secrets. Honey 
girl? Does Jake know about your 
baby?) (No, and we’re not going 
to tell him!) (Didn’t intend to, 
darling — ^just didn’t want to be 
caught foolish.) 

“Well, 1 can’t guess. Who is 
this paragon?” 

“Me.” 

“Uh — But — ” Jake Salomon 
shut up. 

“Sure, sure, dear — Johann was 
not, and Eunice was married. Not 

180 



to mention an old wolf who 
tripped her.” (/ tripped him.) “But 
none of that applies to this new 
female in your lap. I’m a virgin. 
But would not have been, by now 
I think — if that goddam phone 
hadn’t sounded. Don Ameche 
should never have invented it.” 
“Who’s he? Some Russian? 
Alexander Graham Bell invented 
the telephone.” 

“An obsolete joke, Jake — sor- 
ry. Ameche played Bell in a mov- 
ie, oh, about the time you were 
three or four years old. But let’s 
not talk about long-dead actors, 
nor my virginity that I can’t get 
rid of; let’s discuss Eunice.” (My 
favorite subject!) “That overhead 
light is in my eyes; where can I 
squeeze it down? And will you 
keep your lap warm while I trot 
and do it?” 

“I can do it from here. Is that 
better?” 

“Oh, much! I want to see you, 
darling — but floor lights are 
enough. Now tell me about Eu- 
nice. I not only want to be like her 
in other ways . but I would like 
to learn to make love the way she 
did. As much as you’ll tell me.” 
“Joan, you know 1 can’t tell 
such things about a lady.” 

B ut 1 am Eunice, Jake. I just 
don’t have her memory. So I 
need help. Eunice loved you, and 
still loves you I feel certain — and 
Joan Eunice loves you — with a 
love not at all like the fierce af- 
fection Johann always had for his 
one friend — Joan Eunice loves 
you with a love that comes also 
from Eunice’s sweet body that I 
wear so proudly. So tell me about 

GALAXY 




her. Was she as eager as I am?” 
“Uh — ” (Slide your hand inside 
his shirt, twin. Be careful not to 
tickle.) “Joan, Eunice was eager. 
I had trouble believing it at first — 
me an old wreck and she so young 
and beautiful. But she managed 
to make me believe it.” 

“But you are not an old wreck, 
darling. You are in better shape 
than I was at your age. Oh, your 
face has character lines; it has a 
granite majesty that impresses 
everyone. But your body is as 
firm and trim as a man half your 
age. Muscly. And your skin is 
smooth and elastic, not that dis- 
tressing crepelike texture I re- 
member too well. Darling . even 
if you divorce me later, will you 
marry me soon enough to let me 
have your baby?” (Hon, you’re 
knocking him out of the ring! 
That’s one I never dared use.) 
“Eunice! Joan Eunice.” 

“Oh, 1 don’t mean soon enough 
for you — 1 mean soon enough for 
me. I may have fifteen more fertile 
years -but the sooner the better; 
a woman ought not to have her 
first baby at past forty. But you 
will be making babies as long as 
you live. How many children do 
you have, Jake beloved?” 

“Three. You met two of them 
once. And four grandchildren.” 

“1 don’t mean those, I mean 
others. I’ll bet you have at least 
a dozen more, here and there. 
You’ve been rich a long time; you 
could afford it. How many that 
you haven’t mentioned?” 

“Joan Eunice, that’s snoopy.” 
“Yes, and no one has to an- 
swer that sort of question. But 
didn’t Eunice ever ask?” (I did 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



and I think he fibbed. I want to 
hear what he says this time.) 

“Uh— ” 

“I won’t tell anybody but Eu- 
nice. Not even the old Man with 
the book.” 

“You insidious little cuddle 
puppy. I think I have four more. 
Plus one by a married lady who 
may have been kidding me. Three 
1 supported until they were on 
their own; the fourth — and that 
possible fifth - I couldn’t even of- 
fer to. But they were never in 
want.” 

“How was it handled, dear? 
Three maiden ladies who moved 
elsewhere and became overnight 
widows?” 

“Uh . only in one case. I of- 
fered to marry her — 1 was a grass 
widower then — but she elected not 
to, and did marry later and her 
husband adopted the child and I 
made a cash settlement. The other 
similar case- -I was married but 
the settlement was just as amic- 
able. The other two were married. 
Some grief about one — she was a 
compulsive confesser, from which 
the good Lord deliver me! — and 
her husband had to be soothed 
with mucho dinero. The last — 
well, her husband was sterile — 
mumps — and together they picked 
a father. Me. Startled the hell out 
of me. But he offered to put it in 
writing and did. I tore it up and 
settled it with a handshake.” (This 
is all news to me, Joan. But I 
couldn’t believe that such a virile 
and charming man had left no by- 
blows. Keep him talking.) 

Jake grinned and caressed her

I’m certain about, as I have never

insisted on blood tests if a lady ac- 
cused me and I could have been 
the man. But in that case I am 
certain, as we took a holiday to- 
gether, by sailboat, with her hus- 
band as nominal chaperone. So 
that time it was 1, at the right 
time and place. Then — ” He 
paused. “Joan Eunice, I don’t 
know whether Johann would have 
approved of the sequel, or not . 
but 1 don’t want to shock the sweet 
girl you are now.’’ (Honey, don’t 
let him stop therel) 

“Johann can’t be shocked, Jake. 
If it’s rough, I won’t tell Eunice. 
But don’t let me crowd you.” 

“Well ... it wasn’t rough, it 
was sweet. They didn’t use me and 
drop me. I was welcome in their 
home thereafter . and in their 
bed.” 

“Three in a bed?” 

“Uh . don’t be nosy! Some- 
times.” 

“But no more babies?” 

“They were licensed for four 
and had them. But I think they 
picked a different father for each. 

I simply know that, in the several 
times I stayed in their home over 
about ten years, I never slept 
alone. I still get Christmas cards 
from them, each with a photo- 
graph of the family — and my 
daughter looks like her mother, 
not like me, thanks be to God. 
Joan, they were and are a respect- 
able married couple, devout, and 
devoted to each other and to their 
children, and old-fashioned . 
except that, when they were faced 
with the need for a donor, they 
elected to pick donors themselves, 
then use the old-fashioned way 
rather than syringes and a clinic.” 

182 



“Uh . was she sweet in bed?” 
“Quite. But unsophisticated. 
Not a patch on Eunice, if you 
were thinking about her.” 

“I was.” (/ was!) 

“Eunice — Eunice was the most 
glorious thing that could happen 
to any man. Sweet as an angel, 
and as skilled— and as uninhibited 
— as the most famous courtesan 
in history.” (I’m purringl) 

“Jake. I prefer the old-fash- 
ioned way, too.” 

“Yes?” 

“You were sweet to all those 
ladies and you got two unmarried 
ones pregnant and I’m rich enough 
to get away with it and right now 
you are feeling young — I know 
you are! Will you pick me up and 
carry me over there? Or shall I 
walk?” 

“Eunice.” 

“Let’s both walk. But hurry.” 
“Yes. Yes, darling.” 

S HE jumped up, took his hand 
... as the house intercom 
sounded with: “Mr. Salomon! 

Rockford here. Your car is wait- 
ing.” 

Joan said, “Oh, my God!” and 
started to cry. 

Jake put his arm around her and 
petted her. “I’m sorry, darling.” 
“Jake. Tell them to go get din- 
ner. Tell them to be back in, uh, 
two hours.” 

“No, dear.” 

She stomped her bare foot. 
“Jake, I won’t, I won’t! This is 
unbearable.” 

He said quietly, “You prom- 
ised. Look, darling. I’m not nine- 
teen years old and able to perform 
in back seats of cars or on back 



GALAXY 




porches with a party going on in 
the house. I have to have quiet 
and peace.” (Don’t believe him, 
dear! Though he might be scared 
off for a first time.) 

Joan bawled and shook her 
head. He spoke loudly: “Rock- 
ford!” 

“Yes, sir?” 

“We’ll be out in a moment or 
two. Keep the reactor warm.” 

He stepped to the wall and 
squeezed down the intercom to 
zero, then said gently, “Get dressed 
dear.” 

“I won’t! If we leave now, you’ll 
have to stuff me into the car bare 
naked.” 

He sighed and picked her up; 
she stopped crying and looked 
suddenly happy. 

The expression did not last. He 
turned her in his arms as he sat 
down on a straight chair, got a 
firm grip on her, and walloped her 
right buttock. She yelped. And 
struggled. 

He got her more firmly, plac- 
ing his right leg over both of hers, 
and applied his hand smartly to 
her left cheek. Then he alternated 
sides, stopping with ten. He set 
her on her feet and said. “Get 
dressed, dear. Quickly.” 

She stopped rubbing the pun- 
ished area. “Yes, Jake.” 

Neither said another word until 
he had handed her into the car, 
climbed in after her, and they had 
been locked in. Then she said tim- 
idly, “Jake? Will you hold me?” 
“Certainly, darling.” 

“May I take my robe off, 
please? Will you take it off me?” 
With the robe out of the way 
she sighed and snuggled in. After 



a bit she whispered, “Jake darling? 
Why did you spank me?” 

It was his turn to sigh. “You 
were being difficult . and it is 
the only thing I know of which 
will do a woman any good when a 
man can’t do for her what she 
needs. And right then -1 couldn’t.” 
“I see. I think I do.” 

She remained quiet a while, en- 
joying his arms around her and 
breathing against his chest. Then 
she said, “Dear? Did you ever 
spank Eunice?” 

“Once.” 

“For the same reason?” 

“Not quite. Well, somewhat. 
She teased me into it.” (1 tickled 
him, dear. And got the surprise of 
my life.) 

“Then I’m glad you spanked 
me, too. But I’ll try not to tease 
you- though I'll never be the an- 
gel she was.” (Fallen angel. Boss. 
And enjoyed it all, clear down to 
the Pit.) 

“Jake?” 

“Yes, Eunice?” 

“I didn’t really mind being 
spanked by you. Even when 1 was 
crying. But Well, I’m padded 
now built to take a spanking. 
And when you are spanking me, 
you aren’t ignoring me — and any 
attention is better than none. And 
besides — ” She hesitated. 

“Besides what, Eunice?” 

“Well, 1 don’t know — but I 
think it happened.” 

“What happened?” 

“Female orgasm. Well, maybe. 
I don't know what one is supposed 
to feel like. But while 1 was cry- 
ing — and hurting; you have a 
heavy hand, sir- suddenly 1 felt 
very warm inside and something 

183 



I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 




seemed to grow and explode — 
that’s the best I can describe it. 
And I was ecstatically happy and 
didn’t mind the last few wallops, 
hardly noticed them. Was that a 
female orgasm?” 

“How would / know, dearest? 
Perhaps you’ll be able to tell me. 
Later.” 

“Later tonight?” 

“Uh, I think not, Eunice. It’s 
late and we have had nothing to 
eat and I’m tired even if you 
aren’t — ” 

“I am, rather. But happy.” 

“So tonight we’ll rest. When it 
does happen — and I’m no longer 
fighting it — let’s make the first 
time absolutely private and quiet. 
No phones and no servants and no 
distractions. After that — well, it 
might be target-of-opportunity. 
But I’m not a kid. You know what 
I mean, darling; you’ve been old, 
too.” 

“Yes, dearest, much older than 
you are. Eunice can wait. Jake? 
What was this teasing Eunice did 
that was so bad it got her 
spanked?” 

He suddenly grinned. “The lit- 
tle imp tickled me until I nearly 
went out of my mind. So I spanked 
her. But we were alone, and that 
ended satisfactorily. Quite.” 



“How?” 

“How do you think? I excelled 
my usual mediocre performance, 
and Eunice — there aren’t words 
for it, but she excelled her utter 
perfection, impossible as that 
sounds.” (He darn near split me 
like a melon, twin — and I wanted 
him to!) 

“So? Someday / will tickle you 
— and get spanked for it. So take 
your vitamins, dear. Jake, you 
enjoyed spanking me. Didn’t you?” 
He was silent several moments. 
“I enjoyed it so much that I 
spanked you neither as hard nor 
as long as I wanted to. And started 
feeling ‘young’ as you put it — but 
knew that, if 1 didn’t get you out 
of the house right then, you prob- 
ably wouldn’t leave at all. And I 
don’t care to advertise it to ser- 
vants.” 

“You had better marry me. So 
we can ignore servants.” 

“You had better shut up. 
You’re still learning to be a girl, 
and I’m still learning how to han- 
dle you. You’re Eunice — but you 
aren’t Eunice. And we must clear 
up legal matters before we talk 
about such things.” 

“Old mean. Girl beater. Sadist. 
Hold me tight."

B eing in this comer, I often 
think about what sells books. 
And I think pretty definitely that 
the crucial encounter occurs when 
a casual reader, coming upon a 
piece of literature in the market- 
place, finds his money solicited by 
the publisher on the basis of cer- 
tain flattering claims about the 
product. These claims appear right 
on the piece of product, and have 
the jargon designation of “blurbs.” 
Well, as some of you already 
know I’m not crazy about the style 
of most blurbs. Some of you — 
particularly some of you who 
write blurbs— have expressed frus- 
tration and ire. Don’t I understand 
you’re just trying to sell more 
books, and thus do good for the 
whole field? Etc. 

Okay. Perhaps you have missed 
the point, chums, and perhaps we 



will go through it again. Tones up 
the blood, anyhow. 

1 think the blurb attempts to di- 
vert some of the prospective read- 
er’s funds away from his grocery 
budget in exchange for what may 
be a very specious promise of en- 
tertainment. The prospect is con- 
scious that he worked for his 
money and he feels he earned it 
fairly. He applies these same 
standards to the things that try to 
earn from him. I therefore think it 
wise that the blurb should honestly 
inform the prospect about the 
book - that is to say the product. 

It may do so quite legitimately 
by talking even not so much about 
the book as about the train of 
thought or the social format that 
produced it. It may do so quite le- 
gitimately simply by reminding the 
reader that the author of this one 



185 




has produced a listed number of 
previous books that the reader 
bought and enjoyed, and by reas- 
suring the reader that this one is 
just like them. Honesty need not 
be carried to absurd extremes. The 
reader, after all, is a reasonably 
well-read citizen of the world. 

But often enough what the ac- 
tual blurb does — when it isn’t full 
of outright lies or the rediscovery 
of some banal profundity — is to be 
full of personal notes which upon 
examination boil down to “Gee 
whiz, we the editors of this book 
really enjoy being friends with the 
writer. He’s a fantastic luncheon 
raconteur and you ought to see 
him with a lampshade on his head 
at parties.” Or they boil down to 
“Buy this book from my friend.” 
Now you can hardly blame the 
intelligent reader for feeling that 
he has happened in on a gang 
prank in which he has no hope of 
actually participating. I think this 
is what happens all too often; I 
think it’s very bad for science fic- 
tion; I think it’s in extremely ques- 
tionable taste. Ultimately I don’t 
think it sells very many people on 
continuing to buy books, even 
when sometimes the disservice is 
merely a pitiful one, like serving 
wine in a greasy glass. 

L et us have at 14 Great Tales 
Of ESP (Fawcett Gold Medal 
Book #T2164, 75c) edited by 
Idella Purnell Stone, with an intro- 
duction by John W. Campbell. 



All right, now the thing to do is 
to decide whether anyone, starting 
with the prospective reader, is go- 
ing to get any benefit out of this 
book. It’s useless to stand around 
supposing about what odd combi- 
nation of events led the publisher 
to accept an anthology from 
someone without any credentials 
to qualify them for selecting great- 
ness. If I had known how to do it I 
would have done it. So let’s imag- 
ine now our reader or our prospect 
coming up to this article on the 
newsstand and working on a deci- 
sion whether or not to buy it. 

The table of contents sports a 
number of names which are or 
should be rather recognizable. The 
back of the book says; “These 
amazing tales by the great masters 
of science fiction . .” 

Well, that’s not a lot of help. 
Fawcett has the most overblown 
blurbs in the business, apparently 
as the result of an editorial belief 
that the publisher will not okay the 
purchase of any given manuscript 
unless it is at least by a great mas- 
ter. If you have been haunting 
newsstands and buying Gold 
Medal books for any length of 
time you might know this. 

Caveat emptor and let us look 
at these great masters. These great 
masters are Randall Garrett, Mur- 
ray Feinster, Fredric Brown, 
Walter Bupp, Isaac Asimov, Mack 
Reynolds, Reginald Bretnor, Jay 
Williams, Zenna Henderson, 
James H. Schmitz, Robert F.

Young, and Eric Frank Russell 
(represented by an article). 

So we have one, two, three, four 
people who can be counted on to 
be named on any list of reliable 
modern sf writers. We have several 
others of high minor-league status 
and we have the usual number of 
spear carriers. So mueh for that. 
What next? Well, we have the edi- 
tor’s introductory blurbs for the 
various stories herein — for in- 
stance “The Foreign Hand Tie” by 
Randall Garrett: ”... This story 
. is in the realm of possibility — 
since it is possible and even logical 
that a fully developed telepath 
might be employed for espionage.” 

I don’t know about you, but 
that kind of thing worries me. 
First of all, I cannot imagine what 
else you can be but a spy by defi- 
nition, equipped with such a talent. 
Spying on political partisans of 
other ideologies is only the merest 
tentative first extension of the no- 
tion of being able to spy on the 
thoughts of the lady next door, so 
1 don’t really understand what the 
excitement is about. 

But neither am I ready to admit 
to the believability of any blurb 
which began with “In light of the 
fully authenticated cases of com- 
plete telepathic communication be- 
tween twins . .” 

I don’t feel that there are any 
fully authenticated cases of any 
kind of useful telepathic commu- 
nication between twins. I am even 
more inclined to be positive that 



there are no fully authenticated 
cases of complete telepathic com- 
munications between twins, and I 
think that I am not alone in that 
opinion. 1 think most people don’t 
know of any such thing, although 
a number of people may believe or 
wish to believe that it is true, and I 
think it’s incumbent on an editor 
addressing herself to any kind of 
conventional audience to back up 
that kind of offhand remark with a 
few ready references. 

So right away I don’t think this 
is a book for those people who 
read science fiction because they 
find it presents a valid challenge to 
the imagination. Then we get to 
the blurb for Robert Heinlein’s 
“Project Nightmare.” This goes: 
“. His imagination can be as un- 
limited as the universe and the far 
future, or confined, as in this 
story, to the taut boundaries of a 
here-and-now crisis.” 

Well, anybody who confuses an 
abstract like imagination with a 
concrete like the physical universe 
has got a perceptual problem basi- 
cally describable as a lack of imag- 
ination. The size of the scene on 
whieh a creator may choose to cast 
his narrative is in no relevant way 
related to the reach of his mind. 
Most of the people who read 
science fiction are perfectly capa- 
ble of perceiving distinctions of 
that order, and do so as a matter 
of course. That quality goes along 
with a great range of similar per- 
ceptions without which, it seems to

me, one cannot be a science-fiction 
reader. I may be wrong, but in my 
little role here as the guy who 
might buy this book, I am the guy 
who has just decided not to. 

Now, that’s my loss. I don’t 
want you to think I was being 
nasty to Mrs. Stone just for the 
sake of being nasty. The stories in 
this book are by and large good 
ones. They’re fun to read. Some 
of them represent some pretty im- 
pressive achievement on the part of 
people who spun them out. Their 
compilation represents an achieve- 
ment on Mrs. Stone’s part — you 
don’t put together a list like this 
without working at it. Yet, it 
seems to me what has happened 
here is that publisher and editor 
have unwittingly acted together in 
such a way as to discourage a ma- 
jor portion of the potential audi- 
ence for this book. 

T ET’S have a look at Infinity 
^One, New Writings in Specula- 
tive Fiction, edited by Robert Hos- 
kins (Lancer book #75-108, 150). 
What we have here is a rather at- 
tractive-looking package. The 
cover promises an “introduction 
by Isaac Asimov,’’ then “a short 
novel by Poul Anderson,” and then 
states the book is “featuring 
Arthur C. Clarke” and, immedi- 
ately under that, uses the term: 
“never before published.” O.K., 
the reader is being invited to buy 
yet another “magazine in book 
form,” to borrow a term directly 



from the contents page of this par- 
ticular one, and now the question 
is, should he? 

Well, Arthur Clarke is a potent 
name. So is Asimov, but the 
Asimov is a reprint and not an in- 
troduction for this book at all. It’s 
a reprint of an Asimov article 
which originally appeared in a 
house magazine, for Local 1 of the 
Amalgamated Lithographers of 
America, in 1967. It’s an article 
called The Fun In Future Fun, and 
nowhere in it is there any reference 
to the contents of this book or to 
any of the writers in this book. It 
just happens to be an Asimov arti- 
cle which Hoskins has picked up 
and chosen to call an introduction. 

The Clarke is not a new story. 
It’s The Star from 1955, where it 
graced the first issue of Infinity 
Magazine. It subsequently won a 
Hugo and went on to a number of 
anthology appearances. It has 
inded enjoyed a distinguished ca- 
reer over the fifteen years that 
have intervened between its first 
publication and its appearance in 
a product with “never before pub- 
lished” engraved upon its cover di- 
rectly under this story’s author’s 
name. 

Hoskins is as familiar with 
science fiction as anyone could 
want him to be. He’s a long-time 
fan, and a knowledgeable person in 
many ways. He says in his intro- 
duction to The Star: 

“It is not our intention to pre- 
sent reprints in this series, but In- 



188 



GALAXY 




finity One is the lineal descendant 
of Infinity Science Fiction of fond 
memory. And leading off the first 
issue of that first Infinity was a 
story destined to become an im- 
mediate classic. Thus it’s a plea- 
sure to break our own rules for 
the first and only time and present 
once more ...” 

That’s a pretty clumsy piece of 
weasel wording. But if you can un- 
blushingly link “immediate” with 
“classic,” then you have no prob- 
lems at all in declaring that you 
are establishing a rule by breaking 
it. 

But it leaves a funny taste in the 
mouth and meanwhile we, still try- 
ing to make up our mind whether 
this book is any good or not, now 
begin paging through it in dead 
earnest. 

The table of contents looks 
good: it’s got a Silverberg, a Kath- 
erine Maclean, an Anne McCaf- 
frey, a Ron Goulart, a Gene 
Wolfe, a collaboration by Kris 
Neville and K.M. O’Donnell. It 
does have a Poul Anderson novelet 
and it has stories in addition by 
Miriam Allen deFord, R.A. Laf- 
ferty. Dean R. Koontz, Edward 
Wellen and a couple of new names 
like Pat De Graw and George Ze- 
browski. It has something called 
3 Fables — which turn out to be 
two sophomoric short stories by 
Stephen Barr and Michael Fayette, 
respectively, and a funny one by 
Gordon R. Dickson, none of 
whom are masters of this form in 



a field which has only one Fredric 
Brown and a jam of editors who 
think that a short-short story is 
anything that’s shorter than a 
short story. 

But 1 was digressing. Well, as I 
keep trying to establish with some 
of the people who object to my do- 
ing so, I accept in front that since 
you cannot sell a book on the 
basis of what’s actually in it— be- 
cause the store proprietor won’t 
let the prospect read the whole 
package before he walks out with 
it then it does make sense to use 
blurbs and to package the product. 

But then then God damn it!-- 
you are doing nobody any good by 
being dumb in your blurbs. 

Hoskins, as we can see, has al- 
ready established himself as a 
shifty character, thus making one 
wonder whether his book is any 
good. Now we have to cope with 
his version of the English lan- 
guage: “Happily for we as readers 
he is a man yet young enough that 
we can look forward to many 
years of producing stories such 
as . .” 

I have to admit to you that 
that’s the most outrageous exam- 
ple I could find. I don’t think its 
necessary to find very many of 
that caliber. One will do to cast 
serious doubts on the editor’s cre- 
dentials as a man who presumably 
judged the contents of this book. 
He’s either a man in a hell of a 
hurry or a man whom all the time 
in the world wouldn’t help.

If you want to know more 
about that, try the introduction to 
the Katherine MacLean story. I 
give it to you in its entirety: “We 
live in a big universe; Katherine 
MacLean, who writes far too little 
these days, examines one small 
corner of it now ...” 

Gentle reader, I hardly know 
how to convey the depth of my 
personal reaction to what might be 
called the absurdly profound 
school of nonsequitur blurb writ- 
ing. But it’s an article of some 
faith with me that you will convey 
your reaction at this point by 
putting the book down in its rack 
and walking away from it quickly. 

How about this one: “At this 
time nothing is known of the au- 
thor of the following story: even 
his/her sex is a matter of specula- 
tion. Whether man or woman, it is 
certain that Pat De Graw is tal- 
ented, and to be hoped that there’ll 
be many more such stories to 
come ...” 

What follows this is, like most 
of the stories in this book, at least 
good — and that’s my point, it’s at 



least good, but if the editor of this 
thing could not take the trouble to 
discover to whom he was address- 
ing his check for what may have 
been a first sale, and whose life it 
was that he was altering, why, pray 
tell, should we as readers feel that 
we are here in contact with any ex- 
ercise of conscience, discretion, 
judgement, respect for one’s own 
job and one’s own profession, and 
in the end any respect for oneself? 
There are so many sources vying 
for our entertainment money that 
it becomes extremely difficult to 
perceive why anyone should feel 
moved to purchase this particular 
entertainment. 

The generally high quality of the 
stories within this book is irrele- 
vant and is in fact largely wasted. 
The work of the writers contained 
herein is in some danger of going 
down the drain, their earnings are 
in positive danger of being im- 
paired, the publisher’s earnings will 
not be as high as they might have 
been, the editor’s salary probably 
should be cut, and who gains? 
Who gains? ★

the Planet of the Flowers, Dr. Freda Caron’s 
fiance Paul has sent her an exquisite iridescent 
yellow tulip that not only has a plastic memory— 
but can talk. Freda realizes that she must unlock 
the secrets of the flower planet and its strange 
hold on Paul. In this exciting new book, Freda 
must travel from her ultra-rational world-of- 
tomorrow to explore the strange, unearthly flower 
planet. The climax of this shocking and oddly 
beautiful novel is bizarre and delightful.

discards. A gripping account of man’s fight for

THE SPACE MERCHANTS by Frederik Pohl and 
C. M. Kornbiuth. Two major advertising agencies 
are fighting for the Venus account — nothing less 
than total control of the Venus economy and mar- 
kets will do. It is completely unimportant that 
Venus is a harsh, barren, uninhabited planet. 
According to the mentality of Mitchell Courtenay 
of Fowler Schocken Associates, the trick is to per- 
suade colonists to go to Venus, and once there, 
they will have to survive as best they can. One of 
tlie most savage and devastating attacks on mod- 
ern consumer society and the advertising agents 
who are its high priests, The Space Merchants is 
uncomfortably prophetic.

BRAIN WAVE by Poul Anderson. Imagine, some 
mysterious space force that inhibits the world’s 
intelligence. But suddenly, it’s gone and overnight 
the intellect of every living creature is trebled. 
What are the consequences of such instant genius? 
These are the problems confronting Archie Brock, 
former near moron; Peter Corinth, physicist; and 
his no-longer dumb wife. This provocative and 
absorbing book explores the ultimate problem of 
such a situation — in a world free of the difficulties 
that has plagued mankind throughout history, 
what is man to do with his time?
