W arren McCulloch, who looks a 
little like either Gort or 
Klaatu (the one that isn*t a robot), 
but with a beard like George Ber- 
nard Shaw, is in fact neither an 
alien nor a late-blooming Victorian 
playwright. What he is is a mathe- 
matician, neurophysiologist, medical 
doctor and poet, which makes him 
obviously the right man to be a staff 
member of the Research Laboratory 
of Electronics at M.I.T. 

Some time ago we read, and men- 
tioned in these pages, his book, Em- 
bodiments of Mind (The M.I.T. 
Press), which contains such choice 
items for speculation as this: Test 
a man’s ability to recognize whether 
two lines are of different lengths. 
On average, you will find that he 
can do so only if the difference is 
at least 5%. Test the same man’s 
ability to recognize whether a rec- 
tangle is constructed according to 
the “golden mean” — that is, with 
the length in a proportion of 1.618 
to 1 to the height. You will find he 
can do so even when the difference 
is as little as one part in a thousand. 
Are the same sensory and analyti- 
cal powers involved in both exer- 
cises? It would seem so. But one of 
them is fifty times as accurate as 
the other! 

Why? 

Well, McCulloch doesn’t tell us 
why, either in the book or in per- 
son; he prefers to show us the prob- 
lems and let us do what we can to 
solve them. In fact, he Bhowed us 
all one the other day, at the Boston 
Science Fiction Conference in 


March, 1968, where he, Marvin Min- 
sky (the computer man who is com- 
ing rather close to bringing Asi- 
mov’s robots to life — if “life” is the 
right word for robots) and your edi- 
tor took part in a panel discussion. 

Said McCulloch: “There are too 
many people in the world. At the 
present time, humanity comprises 
2% of the world’s biota. The propor- 
tion is increasing; and it cannot go 
on doing so indefinitely or there 
won’t be enough non-human biota 
for us to eat.” 

O f course, we all know that there 
are getting to be an awful lot 
of people; but McCulloch’s transla- 
tion of that fact into a proportion 
between people on one hand and 
trees, cornstalks, mosquitoes, ele- 
phants, dolphins, dogs, cats, bac- 
teria, trapdoor spiders, giant squids, 
daisies and porcupines — not to men- 
tion all the other varieties of living 
things that make up the tally of the 
world’s biota — on the other seems 
to make the picture a little clearer, 
and a lot more alarming. Consider 
food chains, for instance. Your ten- 
ounce beefsteak was paid for by 
roughly twenty pounds of animal 
fodder consumed by the steer who 
grew it for you. Your eight-ounce 
can of tuna is the end of a chain 
that involves eighty ounces of small- 
er fish, eight hundred ounces of lit- 
tle invertebrates and eight thousand 
ounces — a quarter of a ton — of 
plankton; the krill turn the plank- 
ton into themselves by eating it, the 
little fish eat the krill, the tuna eat 


4 


the little fish. If we are In fact one- 
fiftieth of all the life that exists on 
the earth, then clearly we can’t even 
now make up much of our diet out 
of the end terms of long food chains 
— which is to say, for most of the 
human race, the only food available 
is vegetable. (As, in fact, it is.) 
Which has its problems. Vegetable 
food sources are poor in protein. 
Protein is quite essential to human 
diets — particularly to those of 
young children. In protein-poor diets, 
children do not die of hunger very 
much of the time. But they do not 
survive unscathed, either: the pro- 
tein deficiency injures the develop- 
ment of the mind and brain. -They 
may very well grow to be adults, 
but they are unlikely to grow to be 
intelligent adults. 

Having agreed, then, that there is 
an upward limit to the desirable 
size of the human population, and 
that men are begetting themselves 
closer to that limit every day, the 
question was raised: How many 
people should there be in the world? 

Marvin Minsky suggested that 
there was a natural lower limit for 
an optimum population, at least ac- 
cording to his own personal prefer- 
ences, and that was a large enough 
number of human beings to males it 
possible for there to exist persons 
specializing in enough different ac- 
tivities to keep a scientific, techno- 
logical, comfortable civilization alive. 
How many is that? At least a few 
hundred thousand, he suggested, but 
how much more than that was any- 
body’s guess. And an upper limit 
would be no less than the planet can 
support with an adequate diet — 
assuming the development of good 
new food sources, perhaps "some 
billions” of people. 

Those are pretty broad parame- 


ters, to be sure, but no doubt some- 
where between the two figures is 
the “right” size for the human race. 
The lower figure is obviously too 
low. But the upper figure is very 
likely too high, too — and yet that’s 
where we are right now. If we hu- 
man beings are to maintain our- 
selves at £ BCRportion of 2% of the 
world's b&afe W more, we're obvious- 
ly going, to Save to destroy a lot of 
graceful and desirable species to do 
it. As wtffce alrea By done. Worse 
than that, we're going to destroy a 
lot of the graceful and desirable 
features of human life as well. As 
we’re doing BOW. 

Pity the l£man race can't recog- 
nize the fflHffier proportions of hu- 
man-nonhuron l ife forms on this 
planet neatly as accurately as it can 
recognize the jaSpoations of a "per- 
fect” rectangle! Even more of a pity 
that we don’t seem to have any good 
way of n^totafaing the proper pro- 
portion of humanity in the world, 
even if we Knew what it was. 

B y the way, last month we started 
a small (moneywise, anyway) 
contest for suggestions on What to 
Do About Vietnam. 

By the time you read this it is 
possible that the question will be 
settled (we can't tell, because that’s 
two months in the future as we write 
these words, and to be honest about 
it we sf writers don’t really know 
what will happen next any better 
than politicians or scientists do.) But 
lit is even more possible that it won’t 
be; if talks begin, they’ll probably 
still be going on. 

So the contest is still going on too. 
See the ad on page 162 for details, 
if you missed last month's announce- 
ment. And let’s hear from you!

r/ie Bewegal were masters of the universe 


— until they encapsulated two suffering 
human forebrains into their computer ! 


I 

M y name is Rebecca Anne El- 
lents; my fraternal twin is John 
Thomas Ellents. John , is as near 
identical to me as any non-identical 
twin can be. 

' We are encased in a rectangular 


parallelopiped — a box-shaped ob- 
ject ten feet by ten feet by six feet. 
Various input and output terminal- 
leads are arranged about our box in 
convenient positions for their po- 
tential use. 

The Bewegal, who made us the 
way we are now, had great need for 


25 




micro-organic computers with re- 
dundant capacity; thus, Johnny and 
I share our experiences. Should one 
of us fail, the other can take imme- 
diate control, continuing in our ef- 
forts as though no failure had oc- 
curred. Otherwise, to insure that our 
operating-life will continue to be ap- 
proximately equal throughout our 
design-life, our individual periods of 
conscious operation are controlled 
by an atomic timer. 

« I will tell our story for exactly 
two minutes and fifteen seconds; 
then Johnny, who will have been un- 
conscious, yet completely conjoined 
to my experiences, will automatically 
take up our story for his allotted two 
minutes and fifteen seconds. 

I will return at the end of his time 
to be followed by cycle after cycle of 
alternate self-awareness and control 
periods. 

Though I was once human — 
sometimes rational, often flighty and 
girlish — I am now almost com- 
pelled to be logical I am sure you 
will understand this to be a result 
of my use and an effect of my re- 
cent environment, not a natural char- 
acteristic of my birth. 

Perhaps it is not necessary, then, 
to apologize for my pedantry and 
insistence on sequential detail. 

On the last day in my human 
form it seemed the most thrilling ex- 
perience given to a lucky girl of 
only seventeen. I, Becky Ellents, 
had been chosen, along with my 
brother Johnny, to kick off opening 
ceremonies for the first deep-space 
Academy of Mines. 

Dad had something to do with our 
choice, of course. As I had always 


said, “What good are fathers if you 
can’t use them for something?” 

I begged for this pleasure on Dad’s 
every trip home. It wasn’t just 
“boys” that held my interest (at 
least I wouldn’t admit this to any- 
one) but the excitement of going in- 
to deep space. 

Johnny had his own reasons. I’m 
sure, though, they were familiar to 
mine. 

Dad refused to consider the idea 
for a while, before Mother inter- 
ceded; Dad couldn’t refuse then. 

So there we were — seven days 
out on our way to Satellite IV of 
Jupiter. 

I remembered how I looked into 
the mirror to touch up my brown 
head of curls, to straighten my latest 
dress creation and sort of give my- 
self a last good check before join- 
ing the ship’s dance. 

Ah yes! Those humans eyes of 
mine saw far more than a thin 
young girl with turned up nose and 
slight dimples on each side of the 
cheek. They saw far more than five 
feet, ten inches of young female, 
rosy-hued with twinkling eyes, sprout- 
ing strong at the breast. 

Those eyes saw with the “emo- 
tion” of a young seventeen-year-old 
girl; therefore they looked into the 
face of a mature, grown lady — a 
sophisticated, mature, grown lady. 
They saw one who thrived on 
excitement; the kind which provided 
opportunity for sweeping majestical- 
ly forward into a ship’s ballroom, 
there subtly to conquer all males, 
young and old, through innocent vi- 
vacity, goodness, and charm. 

Johnny was taller than I. His five 

IF 


26 



feet, ten and one-half inches could 
be attributed to the strenuous ath- 
letic life which only a male can 
know. His hair was naturally curly- 
brown as was mine; his cheeks, too, 
had slight dimples over which the 
girls swooned, I saw him reflected 
from the mirror, dressed in formal 
attire, with hair combed slick, as he 
passed through the ante-chamber 
joining our two cabins. How well I 
remember the smooth tone of his 
human voice when he said the two 
simple words, “Coming Sis?” 

That was merely one hundred years 
ago. 

1 danced the whole night through. 

A young Lieutenant Bronson, 
tall and handsome, talked me into 
viewing the stars; had I maneuvered 
to bring this about, only the female 
can know. 

The viewing room had specially 
constructed glass; we could freely 
look at the stars without risk of ex- 
posure to hard radiation. Naturally 
everything was darkened, and, though 
many were present, it had the sense 
of mystery and excitement for two 
young people that stars always have 
had. 

The Galilean satellites were a pret- 
ty sight; they were set against the 
sky like small pearls moving to and 
fro as they circled the large planet. 
Hour by hour the panorama changed 
following a sequence predictable as 
clockwork. 

Sometimes a moon passed through 
the shadow of Jupiter to show a 
total eclipse, remaining visible for 
only an hour or so; other times big 
Jupiter swallowed the small pearl 


inch by precious inch. Though seem- 
ingly gone for good, our patience-in- 
waiting rewarded us with the sight — 
the giant planet regurgitates another 
pearl just as beautiful from around 
its other side. 

Did you know an ugly earth feud 
prevented these beautiful satellites 
from the dignity of proper names? 
Why not Io, Europa, Ganymede, 
Callisto and nine other good names 
instead of calling them Satellite I, II, 
III and IV? 

Human emotion, of course! 

The Lieutenant and I sat on the 
couch together, he sat close and held 
my hand. Then he told me of the 
stars, their beauty, their simplicity, 
and their attraction to him; he made 
me see that man’s striving was not in 
vain, though generations must pass. 
These, he made me feel, were man’s 
greatest heritage. 

Where the lucky girl of earth 
might listen to the story of the beauty 
of earth’s moon, my Lieutenant 
would speak of the amazing ring sys- 
tem of Saturn — 170,000 miles 
across and less than 10 miles thick, 
colored, it seems, with paints from 
earth’s rainbow. 

Then he would speak of the tiny 
creations from which all of this glit- 
tering expanse before us was made, 
how these infinitesimal particles of 
energy and space, twisted and bent 
in just certain ways, could be stacked 
one after another — just to scatter 
pin-points of irridescent lights before 
a young girl of seventeen. 

It was lovely, my first case of 
puppy love. I fell in love with Lieu- 
tenant Bronson and his clean manly 
figure.

T his is Johnny writing now l My 
sister*s time is up! 

She can operate fully for only her 
allotted period, then I cycle in auto- 
matically; when my time is up, she 
will be back. We will tell this story 
from its beginning — logically and 
sequentially — as it should be told; 
you will then understand the nature 
of ourselves and our behavior bet- 
ter when described in its proper 
place. 

When Sis was out in the viewing 
deck mooning over that kid officer 
in front of all those people, I was 
down near the polarization room. 
That’s where it happened. One of the 
“fail-safe” rods broke, fell into the 
observational, cross-sectional cham- 
ber blanking out the radiation which 
controlled photon reaction mass. 

There was a device for shutting 
off the blanking chamber but it was 
down for temporary adjustment. Pho- 
tons streamed out beyond their criti- 
cal design limits, the “fail-safe” rod 
melted, and all hell broke loose! 

It wasn’t apparent to the people 
topside at first. Increased reaction 
mass, applied slowly, showed only 
in the astrogation room where con- 
tinuous readings fed back adjust- 
ments to correct course. Course 
could not be corrected. 

We headed out past the orbits of 
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, 
Nothing could be done about the 
problem until the whole unit was re- 
built from bottom up. This we pro- 
ceeded to do from the first, even 
while Sis was gazing at the stars with 
her young hero. 

A week passed before we could ac- 
tually shut down the wild-driving 


photon generator. By then, we were 
well beyond the orbit of Pluto. We 
shut her down. Our velocity was high, 
and we were headed at about forty- 
five degrees from the ecliptic plane 
— which side, I didn’t know. That 
was when they came! 

II 

O ur ship was huge — six hundred 
feet in length. The Bewegal 
came in a ship nine thousand feet 
in length. 

At first we tracked their ship to 
record as a rarely seen dark meteor 
grazing the edge of our solar sys- 
tem. It’s motion relative to ours was 
best described by a positional vector 
which assumed our position to be 
fixed. 

But no matter, regardless of the 
respective orientation between us they 
would have done the same. 

The ship had no distinctive fea- 
tures. Smooth of skin, tapered for 
atmosphere, enigmatical, it reached 
for us by generating waves of the 
so-called weak force known as 
gravity. We swung toward them, 
changing our relative velocity as 
they fully controlled our progress 
with their superior devices. Very 
slowly now, they pulled to their side. 
The skin of their ship peeled back 
almost as though a living, pulsing 
creature were opening its mouth to 
feed. 

Our tiny ship was laid to rest on 
the soft-seeming floor of a huge cav- 
ern. Without warning of any kind, 
another force was used that had the 
effect of complete paralysis on all 
of the ship’s protoplasm — whether 


28 


IF 



man, plant, or amoeba. Oh, they left 
cognition, awareness of self, and 
thinking processes; for these are ele- 
ments of trade far more valuable to 
them than any other of the galaxy’s 
prizes. 

We were aware of the steps 
which followed though many in the 
ship were not always able to watch 
each step, due to their original po- 
sition of paralysis. 

The Bewegal tested our atmos- 
phere, then flooded their hold with 
a like composition; our ship was 
split end to end, though made of 
earth’s toughest alloys. Compartments 
were cut out to be opened as though 
zip-top drinks. And from each they 
carefully, gently, plucked out the 
prizes. 

I was lucky enough — I suppose 
I should say unlucky enough — to 
be in a frozen position such that I 
could see one of them. 

I remember reading a fine essay 
by the ancient earthman, J. B. S. 
Haldane, entitled “On Being the 
Right Size.” How he slashed and tore 
with weapons of fact and logic the 
long-cherished fantasies that man 
might be reduced to the size of the 
bug or amoeba or increased to the 
size of the elephant or dinosaur. Us- 
ing mathematics no stronger than 
arithmetic and simple ratios applied 
to the mechanics of bone structure 
and like organic parts, he showed 
the absurdity of these concepts while 
underpinning the fact of an essential 
correctness of size for all life wheth- 
er man, mosquito, or amoeba. 

Were I, at that time, to tell you 
that each BewegaPs proportions were 
roughly on the same order of magni- 


tude as the ratio of the size of their 
ship to ours — 9,000 to 600, or 15 
to 1 — would have felt the twinge of 
guilt associated with possible distor- 
tion of fact. 

Now, after one hundred extra 
years of experience and knowledge, 
I realize .that Mr. Haldane was 
speaking only from the point of view 
of earth’s narrow environment; there 
he spoke authoritatively. 

Since I have been lost in thought 
for some seconds, I realize my allot- 
ted two minutes and fifteen seconds 
is nearly over. In view of my present 
introspective mood, perhaps it best if 
I stop writing for the remaining 
twenty of seconds, Becky, of course, 
will pick up for me. 

T his is Becky writing again. John- 
ny's time for conscious opera- 
tions is ended , and 1 have returned . 
What were the Bewegal like? 

A Bewegal is pyramidally shaped 
like a tent whose bottom is not 
stretched tight — more like a dress 
flared at the bottom. On top it has 
four, sometimes five, eyes which are 
at least as efficient as former ones. 
The eyes don’t protrude; they lie 
flush with the skin, so leathery and 
wet with smelly chemicals. 

In our ordinary earth environment 
the underlying requisite to morpho- 
genesis — the structural changes dur- 
ing development of the organism — 
is cell multiplication and growth. This 
was not true with the extra-terres- 
trial aliens. Their outer layer of thick 
skin could traverse the specific mor- 
phogenetic processes: cell migration; 
cell aggregation which includes form- 
ing of masses, chords, and sheets; 


WE FUSED ONES 


29 



localized growth, or its lack; fission 
and splitting where splitting in- 
cludes the delamination of single 
sheets into separate layers, the cavi- 
tation of cell masses and the forking 
of cords; folding, including circum- 
scribed folds which form outpocket- 
ings and in-pocketings; and bending, 
which is usually simply folding due 
to unequal growth. 

So you see the Bewegal’s outside 
integument is fully capable of ex- 
treme motility; so much so as to be 
able to form arm-like appendages or 
other, useful cellular arrangements 
whenever desired. 

Were they like the amoeba, mo- 
bile in overall shape? 

No! Their pyramidal tent-like 
shape was a constant. Tbeir huge 
mass — at least seventy-two feet 
high — did not find it necessary to 
bend and stoop. By changing the 
form of their external integument 
they could form cups or grasping ap- 
pendages with great ease, then reach 
out to pluck their object, passing it 
from cup to cup if that seemed to be 
the desirable shape for the moment. 

They were oxygen users too; their 
skin surface could be stretched to 
increase square area of absorption as 
oxygen content was reduced. 

Now you see the difficulty when 
describing them? All the logic com- 
mon to the ordinary earth environ- 
ment could not compensate for lack 
of specific knowledge respecting their 
internal form and function and 
knowledge of conditions of their or- 
dinary habitat. My description is not 
like anything you know. So when I 
say, “They reached to pluck,” you 
know that great morphological 


changes are described by the state- 
ment. 

W hen our cabins were cut open, 
I was standing by the bed along 
with Johnny in eyes-open, frozen po- 
sition as was Johnny. A cup of flesh 
reached into the opened cabin to 
scoop us forward and up. I tumbled 
on the flesh, and though paralyzed 
by their energies I yet could sense 
through my original sensory network. 

The flesh was slick and rubbery 
like a piece of fresh calf’s liver; the 
smell was over-powering of rotten 
flesh. If it were not for the paraly- 
sis I’m sure I would have vomited; I 
could only tumble upward, frozen in 
muscle, seething with emotion and 
sick in body and spirit. 

We were placed carefully, one at 
a time, into a rectangular box where, 
still sentient and aware, still with 
senses alert and working, we were 
covered with a sticky gel-like sub- 
stance as it filled the box to the top. 

I lay, able to move only in thought, 
yet still able to see lights and shad- 
ows overhead and to feel the stick- 
iness of the material surrounding us. 
I lay there — possibly hallucinating, 
I don’t know — for endless hours. 
It may have been months or weeks; 
for the chemical action of the en- 
zymes which cause physiological time, 
had ceased for me. 

I do remember some of the things 
I thought about while in this pecul- 
iar stasis. I remembered lieutenant 
Bronson and our brief flirtation. 
Where was he now, with his big, 
brave body? 

My father, too, was among those 
new in stasis. What would mother,

who stayed at home, say? Was John- 
ny the one right next to me? Who or 
what were these giants of rotting 
flesh? What did they wish of us? 
Certainly not gold or radium or 
knowledge. Were we to be pickled 
specimens in some extra-terrestrial 
collection? Or were we to be kept 
alive to be placed on exhibit as hu- 
mans do with the lower animals in 
zoos? 

Would we be aware and sentient, 
as now, forevermore? 

My wildest imagining did not ap- 
proximate the truth. 

Except for tiny bumps and mo- 
tions which were transmitted through 
the gel-like material to my body, I 
never knew when transfer took place 
from ship to laboratory. 

Ah, yes the laboratory! How well 
I remember it! For here I lost my 
beautiful eyes. But I lost more as 
you shall see. 

Ill 

T his is Johnny again \ Beckys time 
is up so 1 will continue our story 
for my allotted two minutes and fif- 
teen seconds . 

I was carefully lifted from my 
packing box by appropriate exten- 
sions of our captor. It cleaned the 
gel-like material from my whole 
body. Very carefully still, it peeled 
the clothes from my body, stopping 
only to study the precise relationship 
between my school-ring and my fin- 
ger and my wrist-watch and my arm. 
Once assured they were independent 
artifacts, these were cut from me. 

Using fine instruments and the 
finely drawn flesh of its outer integ- 


ument, my captor cleaned all my 
bodily orifices of the gel-like sub- 
stance. I still could not move a sin- 
gle muscle; but residues of the gel- 
like material sufficiently wetted my 
eyes so they could follow the bread 
sweep of the laboratory as I was 
turned over and about. 

Next I was placed under an in- 
tense but cold light beam. From what 
I have since learned, it must have 
been a microscope light. Here micro- 
manipulators of various types com- 
pleted the remainder of the process. 

First to be stripped from me was 
the sensation of pressure and pain 
over the skin areas. 

My body responded well to their 
pricks of pain; I had no conscious 
control over any of its parts. They 
probably used some automatic map- 
ping method for when done, micro- 
miniature needles were placed at the 
nerve branches which served the areas 
of the skin to be controlled. 

For centuries man has described 
the physical and psychological basis 
of pain. Man eventually agreed to 
identify two kinds: one, called a 
prick pain, is a bright, relatively 
short pain; the other, called a dull 
pain, is long-lasting and less well 
localized. 

I can tell you, however, that either 
type of pain can be complete and 
total hell! 

From tiny, bright, highly localized 
pain pricks, their automatic machin- 
ery inexorably built up pain until my 
total skin area was one whole mass 
of throbbing sensation from which I 
could not flee, physically or mentally. 

Oh God! How I wanted to scream 
in pain and terror!

E ach man “knows” nature has so 
constructed him that he can 
freely choose death, disease, or men- 
tal flight Threshold levels are con- 
structed in each person’s body be- 
yond which normal cellular response 
will not go; Other safety techniques, 
such as choice of illness or choice of 
peculiarities in behavior, offer some 
choice of flight from a world too fill- 
ed with pain. 

Where does one go when all this 
is denied? 

Imagine the worst kind of torture 
for the damned; multiply this by a 
factor of a hundred; then feel that 
throbbing, sentient ego which makes 
up the essential you scurry, grovel, 
run, panic, cry. Weep, scream, melt; 
yet it lies there trapped, helplessl 
They fastened tiny, permanently- 
joined neuronic attachments to each 
of the nerve fibers controlling the 
sensation of pain. 

Then the testing began. Naturally 
they would want to ensure inde- 
pendence of the uncovered pain net- 
work before preceding further. Cer- 
tainly, too, they would want to 
learn threshold response levels, type 
and category of response, recovery 
time under high body stimulation and 
under fatigue. Oh yes! They would 
need to know all of those thin gs and 
more, before proceeding in their care- 
ful, systematic, scientific fashion! 

In a similar manner, using differ- 
ent instruments of torture, the Be- 
wegal scientist isolated the cold and 
the more deeply buried warmth re- 
ceptor units. These, too, were fully 
tested to assure the Bewegal’s full 
knowledge of my capability under all 
conditions. 


Analogous means were used to lo- 
calize and make attachments to points 
of pressure sensitivity. 

There was no blessed reflex which 
could jerk away my whole body — 
Oh, the agony of the damned! 

T his is Becky again ; Johnny's time 
was over . 

Let us be satisfied with Johnny’s 
description as “hell.” Suffice it to 
say, they found all of our skin re- 
ceptors first. Attachments of a per- 
manent nature were placed on every 
ending. They tested us for design 
characteristics — threshold levels — 
and so on, for days, while the tiny, 
formerly-important ego in each of us 
tried to scream the pain and emotion 
out, only to have it rebound, echo- 
ing round and round in our tiny 
cognition corner, seemingly forever! 
Finally, this phase was finished. 
They turned the stimulus input 
levels down to steady-state levels of 
tolerance; with my body paralyzed, 
my little girl’s ego — the one which 
wanted so badly to conquer brave 
Lieutenant Bronson — vainly direct- 
ed its every effort to accomplish one 
single solitary act of will — to scream 
in terror!

A s time would show, thejrhad need 
for a wider range of frequency 
in my vision as well as need for 
capacity to attach specialized devices 
whenever desired, such as infrared, 
telescopic, microscopic and so forth. 
They removed my eyes for this pur- 
pose. 

They reached into my he$d and 

IF 


32 



severed the optic chiasma and por- 
tions of the corpus callosum of the 
brain known 40 provide a system of 
interconnection between eye channels 
— they wanted the eyes to work in- 
dependently. 

The souses of smell and taste were 
next. 

They had no need for my voice; so 
it was stripped away, as were the 
small bones of the ear, beyond the 
semicircular canals, they dug their 
instruments into the nerve to the 
brain itself. 

By now, they had stripped me of 
natural sight, sound, taste, smell, 
feeling and motion as well as the 
pleasure of sleep or death. Though I 
might have been awake for many 
months, I was incapable of sleep. Ar- 
tificial chemical nutrients were de- 
signed to flush constantly through my 
system sweeping all poisons away 
and keeping my all-important brain 
awake, alert, and at peak perform- 
ance. They knew what they were 
about! 

There you have it; you can visual- 
ize our situation. Every sense of im- 
portance to the Bewegal was strip- 
ped, studied, and hooked-up to stim- 
uli simulators; full consciousness was 
maintained in us at all times. 

Full pain, too, could be turned 
up or down merely by twisting of 
knobs and levers without the blessing 
of motion, emotion, or mental or 
physical escape in any form. 

Can you visualize, now, the sen- 
tient cadaver that was I? Split at 
cheeks and nose, cut through to brain 
at eye-casing, eyes and nose gouged 
out with long wires attached, ears 
scooped hollow with more wires at- 


tached, every square centimeter of 
space roughened and wired, and hav- 
ing tubes entering here and there, 
flowing with chemicals to sustain 
life. In the center of this dead-living 
corpse was the quivering, sentient be- 
ing called “I,” with still-fresh mem- 
ories of sweet smelling perfume, 
handsome Lieutenants and the beauti- 
ful, vibrant thought of excitement 
just around the corner. 

V 

B ecky’s time has ended . This is 
Johnny again! 

In a very crude sense, highly over- 
simplified, man could get along with- 
out the cortex since it is an organ 
of elaboration and refinement through 
evolutionary trials, rather than a nec- 
essary participant in the actions of 
the nervous system involving sensory 
and motor actions. 

As the brain’s hemispheres evolved 
from simple amphibian form to the 
huge cerebral cortex of man, they de- 
veloped new connections to the brain- 
stem. Bundles of nerve fibers moved 
out from the hypothalmus, the thal- 
mus, the recticular formation and 
other brainstem points to adjacent 
sections of the cerebral cortex. These 
connections were identified, severed 
and reconnected to the Bewegal’s ap- 
paratus. 

The first inkling I had of what 
they were doing came with hallucina- 
tions which occurred in both ran- 
dom and peculiar fashion. 

I would see my visions — small 
children running, a space ship lifting 
into the sky, my mother handing me 
my baby-bottle. Then I would smell 
odors — beautiful lilacs, fresh cow

manure, a spring day after a cleaning 
rain. My feet would tingle, my flesh 
would crawl, my mouth tasted terri- 
bly salty, and so on* 

Little by little, they mapped my 
brain* Only later did 1 discover that 
they had eliminated any connections 
of the brain with such useless items 
as lips, hands, arms, legs and so forth* 
These brain portions were not al- 
lowed to go wasted, however — the 
areas were re-tied to other brain re- 
gions to serve as subsidiary or back- 
up computer units* Later you will see 
the use for these extra units. 

Then their probes found it! Near 
and around the brainstem were the 
pleasure centers* These consist pri- 
marily of hunger-sensitive and sex- 
sensitive centers; probing there with 
electrodes caused me subjective pleas- 
ure of a kind which can only be de- 
scribed as bordering on the mystical* 

Satisfaction of the basic drives of 
hunger and sex, buried deeply with- 
in the old brain, seems to be simply 
a matter of the presence of electrical 
current in the proper neuron circuits 
of the brain. 

Don’t feel that pleasure was the 
Bewegal’s only discovery; they were 
after the punishment centers too. 
They found them near the hypo- 
thalamic region. 

I wondered then, “Are heaven and 
hell both located in my animal 
brain?” 

T he brain’s reticular system can 
turn consciousness on or off 
merely by sending proper signals to 
the portions of the brain involving 
conscious processes. Its signals, in 
turn, come from sensory impulses re- 


ceived over taps on the communica- 
tion channels of the central nervous 
system* 

Signals which may represent touch, 
pain, sound or light are integrated by 
the reticular neurons to build up an 
output voltage to a threshold value 
beyond which the arousal commands 
are triggered. 

In the absence of such real in- 
coming sensory data, the mechanism 
can be fooled into believing there is 
something that requires conscious 
attention* By attaching a switch to 
couple the reticular activating sys- 
tem to the cortex, the Bewegal had 
control of my conscious mind. They 
could shut me off or turn me on at 
their willl 

Still move could be developed from 
the reticular activating system* When 
we focus our attention on something 
extraneous signals seem to recede to 
the background* A person with un- 
usual concentration powers may be 
oblivious to all around* 

The signals do not just appear to 
recede* They actually do recede. In- 
tensity-control signals are generated 
in the recticular system to reduce 
our sensitivity to uninteresting or ir- 
relevant stimuli and thereby permit 
us to achieve the useful result of con- 
centration. 

My ability to concentrate or not 
to concentrate was at their control! 

VI 

T hank the good Lord that, though 
they knew so much about every 
other area, they knew little about 
the functions of man’s frontal lobes. 
Once probed in that area, I might 


34 


IF 




have become dull from lack of in- 
itiative and disoriented through hav- 
ing very little interest in life. 

These frontal lobes acted much as 
a stand-by capacity for my cortical 
thinking; here too, I could entertain 
complex thought patterns as well as 
organize and set up motivational 
goals within myself. 

It is for this latter reason that I 
thank God, for it will save our race! 

The frontal lobes can assist in set- 
ting up and re-structuring circuit pat- 
terns of different and unique design. 
To some extent, for a while, they 
had control over this function — but 
only indirect, unknowing control. 

My very soul seemed to recede to 
the frontal lobes! 

The Bewegai searched for the 
source of experimental memory. Sim- 
pler routines which I had learned in 
my life resided in the deeper struc- 
tures of the brain. I mentioned hav- 
ing the corpus callosum cut in con- 
nection with cutting the optic chi- 
asm. By so doing, they caused all 
subsequent input signals to be stored 
independently on either side of the 
brain with no redundancy of storage 
as was the condition before. 

Prior to this operation, I would 
take the input signal from my eyes 
and record it simultaneously on both 
sides of the brain in the cortex. 
After the operation, sight from one 
side recorded only on that side, and 
similarly for the other side. 

In laboratory tests, they fed iden- 
tical signals over the two nerve net- 
works which transmitted to each re- 
spective half of the brain. By checks 
made at the temporal lobes and oth- 
er deeper locations, they were able 


to determine exactly what differ- 
ences, if any. Occurred to the same 
signal when recorded in different 
halves of the cortex. 

Whatever they were to use us for, 
redundancy was not as important as 
an increase of independent storage 
capacity — or so it seemed at first. 

I t may be fascinating to contem- 
plate the effects of splitting my 
brain into halves. By the logic of 
biology, it should result in the split- 
ting of me into two separate indi- 
viduals, both inhabiting and control- 
ling the same body from time to time. 

It didn’t happen quite that way 
because the lower integrating func- 
tions of the brain stem were not 
split. 

Now you have the complete pic- 
ture of what was done to us. En- 
closed by leads to electronic stimuli 
simulators and to output units from 
portions of the brain; cut into again 
and again for identification, testing 
and control of functions of one type 
or another; isolated by chemistry and 
physics; compartmented to dual-brain 
functions; controlled in memory and 
consciousness; isolated from natural 
sources for both pleasure and pain; 
I was nearly one hundred per cent at 
their will. 

What did I have left, you ask? 

I was still “I” ! 

Once our human design character- 
istics and performance ratings were 
established, the Bewegai tied us to 
their permanent devices for sustain- 
ing life. 

The whole assembly was self-con- 
tained; chemicals processed the prod- 
ucts of metabolic break-down and 


36 


IF 



re-constituted the essential ingredi- 
ents; then pumps passed the cleaned 
materials back through us. In like 
manner, the chemicals which were 
used in this process were renewed by 
other catalytic processes. 

A long-lived radioactive battery 
provided whatever additional ener- 
gies were required to supplement 
this biotic cycle. 

Once they had carefully tested the 
cycle, they filled the space between 
my body and a metal container, 
within which I was lowered, with a 
strange plastic material. The plastic 
flowed around the wires and tubes 
connected to me until it filled all of 
the space; then it hardened to encap- 
sulate firmly. No wire or pipe could 
possibly shake loose within that plas- 
tic. 

Near the surface of my skin, wher- 
ever a square hundredth of an inch 
was not covered by a micro-probe, 
was developed a moving, almost liv- 
ing, set of complex molecules which 
could take dead flesh and slowly 
move it to one of the tubes for 
eventual processing. 

Other clever devices of this type 
were also used wherever needed to 
provide the Bewegal with a computer 
tool which was completely self-con- 
tained for their use. 

One special connection from my 
brain went through the plastic to 
the outside of the container. This 
set of leads was attached to my 
fraternal twin sister Becky. Undoubt- 
edly in their many tests for design 
performance data they were impress- 
ed with the near identity of our re- 
sponse; for their use, this was a lucky 
happenstance. 


These leads had the effect of caus- 
ing Becky’s experiences to be mine 
and vice-versa. Where our own cor- 
pus callosum had been cut to pre- 
vent redundancy of memory storage 
within ourselves, they now deliber- 
ately brought redundancy back to 
the total system by means of this 
interconnection. Whatever Becky ex- 
perienced, I would also experience; 
and whatever I experienced, she 
would experience. 

B ecky was placed in a similar con- 
tainer to min e — self-contained 
except for input-output leads and 
protected by plastic potting materials. 
The two of us were then placed into 
a single box side by side where met- 
als and plastics of all types and 
strengths were placed around us to 
protect us under every conceivable 
force. It was then that the Be- 
wegal’s inserted timer began to op- 
erate. Controlled by the rate of dis- 
integration of our nuclear energy 
source, periodically Becky, then I, 
must assume control of the input- 
output signals and take prime respon- 
sibility for calculations and data pro- 
cessing every two minutes and fifteen 
seconds. 

Not only were we packaged to 
provide dual operating characteristics 
of the same performance rating, but 
should one of us be accidentally de- 
stroyed, the other would always have 
complete information and capability. 
Furthermore, by periodically cycling 
operational time between the two of 
us, we would wear out in equal 
amounts, thus providing for constant 
equality and quality of level-of -per- 
formance.

VII 

T he Bewegal were brilliant, were 
they not? 

Here l am . It's Becky again . John- 
ny 9 s time was up. 

They turned our consciousness 
down to low level for many months; 
until the ship was completed we could 
not be properly placed. During that 
period my mind hallucinated, since 
I was deprived of sensory input data 
of any kind; I was unable to deter- 
mine the passage of time. 

The first inklin g I had of my new 
function in life was when input leads 
were connected to the programming 
machine. It had to teach me the ba- 
sic operating-system language so I 
could function as a successful Weap- 
ons-control computer in the BewegaPs 
new spaceship. 

Unlike our earth-bound program- 
mers, this programming machine had 
complete control over all my func- 
tions. It could whip me with stabbing 
fingers of red-hot pain or reward 
me with the ecstasy of the gods; in 
short, I learned fast and well. Only 
when past neural patterns interfered 
with incoming concepts would the 
pain whip be used. Then sooner or 
later, the old patterns would become 
deconditioned. My only purpose, 
now, was to learn the exceedingly 
fast, complicated language necessary 
to communicate with the Primary- 
fire-control computer who, in turn, 
was in contact with the Master-con- 
trol computer. 

All I learned from that day into 
many years of the future came 
through the triply distorted senses of 
the Master-control computer, the 


Primary-fire-control computer, and 
the horribly precise language which 
made up the operating-system lan- 
guage for all of us. 

What was the operating-system 
language like? 

First of all, it had to be synthetic. 
Otherwise, intercommunication be- 
tween several of the widely differing 
life forms used in organic-computer 
construction would have been mean- 
ingless. Second, the language had to 
be learned to perfection so that no 
slippage of time could occur when 
orders to move or to fire came. 

When the Bewegal re-structured 
useless parts of my brain once de- 
voted to control of hands, lips, feet 
and so on during my manufacture, 
they expected these auxiliary units 
to be used for storing and learning 
the basic operating-system language. 

Thus, for me, a five pulse code 
message received in nano-seconds 
might represent a pucker of the lips, 
a little motion of one finger on my 
left hand, a twitch of the foot and a 
jerk of the arm muscle — since 
these were brain regions where the 
basic operating-system language was 
interpreted. 

For another entity constructed 
from ingredients of a different plan- 
et, other interpretations would be 
needed. So you see, the Qperating- 
system’s meaning and structure were 
completely different for each kind of 
organic-computer to be found inter- 
connected throughout the ship’s com- 
munication network. 

T here are two general ways by 
which signals may be moved 
from point to point to convey mean- 


38 


IF 



ing. One obvioui W§y is to connect 
between points and £$tnember which 
line was connected to which point. 
Another way is to connect the lines 
in any random manner, relying on 
the ability to discriminate the kind of 
signal to the other end. Our way of 
learning the operating-system was 
more akin to the latter method. We 
used our ability to discriminate pat- 
terns of pulses, though prior mean- 
ings may have been totally different. 

Eventually I learned the Fire-con- 
trol programming language; I was 
installed about one-third of a mile 
from the front of a huge ship nearly 
ten thousand feet long. Then we lift- 
ed from our giant planet for open 
space and service-testing. 

So long as the ship was operation- 
al, ready-current flowed through all 
computers. It was on this ready-cur- 
rent line that I learned whatever oc- 
curred to the ship or within the ship. 

Do you, by chance, know the pro- 
gramming languages of earth derived 
from ancient Fortron or Cobol? If 
you do, then use the one you know 
best to describe to another program- 
mer what you see when you look out 
the window. Quite a trick involved 
isn’t it? , 

Of course, our language was far 
more flexible than either of those; 
the limitations were essentially the 
same. Master-control, a sentient be- 
ing from another star far removed 
from ours, and whose shape and func- 
tion I would learn, always knew 
where we were going, how fast we 
traveled, by what method we trav- 
eled, the status of the engines, the 
ship, the weapons, and the fuel sup- 
ply. 


Master-control was the only one 
of us organic-computers to be blessed 
with video receptors both inside and 
outside the ship. In our highly sym- 
bolic, restricted fire-control language. 
Master-control would pass whatever 
he saw or knew on to the rest. Thus 
we knew something, albeit distorted 
by machine, alien nervous structure 
and synthetic language. 

W hen our ship lifted to be given 
our first functional service- 
test, I was wired to react without de- 
lay to certain instructions by the 
Primary-fire-control computer, an- 
other life form captured by the Be- 
wegals. 

Certain signals from Primary-fire- 
control caused me to compute the 
velocity, acceleration and position at 
either slow or fast rate. When on 
fast, I was caused to concentrate al- 
most solely on the problem at hand. 
Computation time and accuracy were 
not then limited to the speed trans- 
mission of axon or dendrite of the 
neuron. A different type of phenome- 
non took over, giving me virtually 
instantaneous answers, nano-seconds 
became slow. 

Could this be what we humans 
called insight? 

Furthermore, we could not become 
fatigued, for as fast as poisons de- 
veloped in our biological systems, the 
apparatus encased with us would re- 
spond accordingly; it was a demand 
type system. 

I could also move the gun to 
proper position slowly or rapidly. 
The gun, however, was not a physi- 
cal projection beyond the ship. Like 
the multi-Iensed configuration of an 


WE FUSED ONES 


39 



insect’s eye, the gun consisted of 
many apertures which could be pow- 
ered or not. 

Switching to turn on power in the 
proper aperture was the equivalent of 
gun motion. My function, then was 
to switch to the proper aperture, 
after which tremendous energy pour- 
ed forth. 

Primary-fire-control gave me all 
pertinent data. I acted on the data; 
either by slow or fast thought, I sent 
out specific impulses. What happened 
after that was a function of the way 
I was wired; I had no need to see 
the object of our fire as did Primary- 
fire control. 

It was now obvious why Johnny 
and I were so valuable. When the 
Bewegal’s enemy returned fire, one of 
his highest priority items was to elim- 
inate the source of the fire power 
coming at him. Since I had to be 
close to the gun for time-of-trans- 
mission’s sake, I was the most vul- 
nerable of all the deeply buried com- 
puters. Should I get holed, there was 
always the other part of the com- 
puter — Johnny. Having full knowl- 
edge and equivalent capability, he 
could continue the battle without in- 
terruption. 

VIII 

T his is Johnny writing again . 
Becky* s time is up once more . 
We traveled in fleet formation to 
another galaxy. I can tell you the di- 
rection, velocity and acceleration of 
every ship with respect to every oth- 
er ship and all with respect to several 
galactic coordinates; I can tell you 
the mass and shape of each ship; I 


can tell you the probable composi- 
tion of each ship. .AH of these data 
were transmitted to me by the gos- 
sip among us organic-computers. 

I could tell you how many Be- 
wegal were in each ship, their mass 
and location at any given time and 
their acceleration and velocity at any 
given time. 

What I could not do is tell you 
whether they were male or female, or 
what their motives were when travel- 
ing from galaxy to galaxy. 

The same holds true for the many 
planets under strange suns which we 
visited. Seeing these things only 
through the eyes of an operating- 
system fire-control code, I knew many 
irrelevant things about masses, or- 
bital velocities and such; but my 
strange captors, scattered here and 
there through the ships, appeared to 
me as faraway abstractions! 

Before describing my one and only 
space fight, I should explain that 
Master-control could not possibly will 
himself to take over the ship in re- 
volt. All organic computers, save 
man, operate mechanistically in a 
predictable manner. No other extrater- 
restrial encountered by them had our 
equivalent of pre-frontal lobes where 
we could setup and knockdown an 
endless number of self-described, self- 
defined behavior circuits. Since each 
extra-terrestrial used for computer 
construction was exactly predictable, 
they bad no apparent need to search 
further, once known brain equiva- 
lents were discovered in us humans. 

We came out to our single-ship pa- 
trol somewhere near as O-type star 
with photosphere about 150,000 de- 
tgrees, Fahrenheit.

' r 

I still remember the mnemonic 
taught to me by my high school 
teacher on the sun-type symbols 
OBAFGKMN classification. He said 
“Oh, be a fine girl, kiss me now!” 
Wouldn’t I make a pretty sight try- 
ing to kiss a girl now? 

A s soon as we came out of our 
other-vector drive — the only 
human symbol I can use in discussing 
the phenomenon — another huge 
mass was sensed near our ship; in- 
stantly the data came to me. Obvi- 
ously its tonnage and construction 
was very similar to ours — equally 
obviously it was not friendly. 

Several of the skin-peelings in front 
of the gun ports pulled back. Instant- 
ly there poured forth tremendous 
quantities of energy; I was put on 
quick-time and given data to fire by. 
I triggered the gun cells near me 
again and again. Based on radio-ac- 
tive time, the fighting lasted for days 
of my human physiological time. But 
I was just as alert at its end as at 
its beginning, thanks to the mar- 
velous mechanical-chemical system 
monitoring my needs. 

Our ship’s skin was tough; the 
enemy’s fire was tougher — it melted 
the first skin layer near my loca- 
tion. Our return fire melted their 
closest gun port, causing them to 
maneuver drastically. 

As soon as this happened, we had 
the other ship on the run; it disap- 
peared from the area of space cover- 
ed by our mechanical sensors. The 
Bewegal had instruments by which to 
track it, however, since Master-con- 
trol was given new galactic coordin- 
ates. 


We chased them across several 
galaxies before engaging them again. 
This time we were victorious; the 
other ship was burned to small pud- 
dles and fragments to drift forever 
somewhere between two island gal- 
axies!

A s you can see, my life was sim- 
ple and highly uninformative as 
a Fire-control computer. But as with 
all weapon systems, one becomes ob- 
solete or poorly designed when com- 
pared against the newest information. 

After perhaps forty years of serv- 
ice, we were retired. We computers, 
though, being still of latest design 
so far as non-military life was con- 
cerned, were too valuable to melt 
down in the scrap heap. 

A science laboratory took me be- 
cause of my dual-redundancy fea- 
ture. I was more than a scientific 
curiosity, however. I was a most ad- 
vanced computer expected to per- 
form prodigies for their scientific 
service. 

John Von Neumann in 1958 once 
estimated a maximum possible stor- 
age requirement for a sixty-year-old 
human to be around 2.8X10 20 
bits of information. On the basis that 
one on-off switch can store but one 
bit, this means each human neuron 
in the nervous system has associated 
with it the equivalent of 30 million 
on-off switches of memory capacity! 

Whether this figure was or was not 
a good estimate for human upper- 
limits, as a Fire-control computer 
I hadn’t begun to use a trillioneth 
part of my capacity. But as a labora- 


WE FUSED ONES 


41 



tory computer, I began to use up 
capacity rapidly. Perhaps ninety 
percent of my total available capac- 
ity was used for logic type calcula- 
tions while other stand-by com pu t e rs 
carried tables-of-vafues and other 
data available at my request. 

One advantage to my form was my 
double accuracy. Whenever I im- 
pulsed an answer to the waiting sci- 
entists, they had only to wait until 
my partner’s turn cycled on two and 
a quarter minutes later, then ask her 
the same question. The answer was 
always the same as mine. 

Although my chief function was 
to service all fields of interest, I was 
most often called upon to assist in 
the design of new, organic-compu- 
ters. The Bewegal scientists would 
bring me input and output character- 
istics and the chemical and physical 
construction of the captured being. 
Through simultaneous solutions to 
non-homogeneous, non-linear, asym- 
metrical differential equations, I 
would predict the nature of the in- 
ternal connections of the entity’s 
nervous structure. Then I would fol- 
low up this knowledge with a set 
of pre-programmed instructions for 
the automated equipment which 
could do so much work of creating 
organic-computers from living, sen- 
tient beings. 

It was chiefly through this kind of 
application I learned of die human’s 
uniqueness — and began to wonder 
if I could only take advantage of 
the knowledge somehow! 

Hpbe Bewegal poured their science 
1 into me. I am still a huge res- 
ervoir of alien information about the 


function of the universe from the 
macroc o s m to the m icrocosm. 

Of course, I had to learn new lan- 
guages. The basic application lan- 
guage was mathematics; I was never 
good at mathematics; 1 didn’t like it, 
I saw no real use for it. The Be- 
wegal didn’t care about my likes or 
dislikes. When a particularly difficult 
piece of abstract logic proved balky, 
they simply turned up my powers of 
concentration while liberally exercis- 
ing my pleasure and pain centers. 

1 learned mathematics! 

Absorption of compediums of 
chemical compounds and their char- 
acteristics was trivial compared to 
learning this basic language of sci- 
ence. 

They stuffed roe for ten years with 
the most advanced designs conceived 
by their culture as well as all of the 
basic principles and facts needed to 
su pp ort their designs. 

Normally I was run day and night. 
Sometimes, though, they shut my con- 
sciousness off for periods of time. 
Other than our allotted two minutes 
and fifteen seconds of rest during 
normal operations, this was the first 
sleep in over forty years! 

ere is Becky again! Hello! 

I used to dream about bringing 
back to earth the knowledge we gam- 
ed from the laboratory. 

After fifty years with the Bewegal 
— forty as a Fire-control computer 
and ten as a scientific computer — 
we were transferred to business data 
processing functions. 

Compared to the BewegaPs size, 
we were classified as “mkro-mmia- 
ture organic computers.” This kind 

IF 



42 



of computer was new to business 
though at least fifty years old to war- 
technology and science. 

Our chief advantage to business 
was in our size; since space cost 
money — or whatever it was they 
used for transfer of their credit — I 
was greatly desired. 

Where the predominant emphasis 
in the laboratory had been on my 
mathematical abilities, involving tre- 
mendously complex calculations gen- 
erally characterized by limited input 
and limited output, the business world 
demanded very little in the way of 
arithmetical or logical functions but 
a great deal in the way of storage 
and input-output capacities. I was 
loaded nearly full with tariffs, mini- 
mal-cost routes, identification of 
names and addresses as well as de- 
tail on personal accounts. 

The Bewegal placed us in the most 
important trading bank of their in- 
tergalactic culture. One of my optic 
nerves was connected to a light re- 
ceptor; this was my first video in 
fifty years. Can you imagine how 


thrilled I was? It didn’t matter that 
I could see far cm either side of the 
ultraviolet or infrared, or that it was 
only monocular. 

When the optic nerve was first at- 
tached to the seeing device, I thought 
my mind was again hallucinating; 
after several sessions with the pain- 
pleasure centers, I soon re-adjusted 
to sight. 

Then when my consciousness was 
turned up to its highest, I could grasp 
visual messages, though they flashed 
across the Bewegafs screen and per- 
sisted for what seemed like only 
micro-seconds. 


1 was operated at this peak aware- 
ness level for ten more years. Un- 
known to them, much integration of 
these random documents occurred in 
the deeper, older portion of my nerv- 
ous structure to be passed directly 
to the fore-brain. I’m sure they 
wouldn’t have cared about the inte- 
gration aspect, for this is a common 
feature of all organically designed 
computers everywhere. 

No! They would have been more 
concerned with wasted extra-capac- 
ity in the form of my fore-brain and 
also would have sorrowed over their 
missed opportunity to study this 
unique brain tissue. 

It was difficult, but during the 
next ten years I was able to piece 
together the size and complexity of 
their civilization. The Bewegal have 
Achilles’ heels. I know them well I 
I was next donated to a school for 
creative arts. It was here I learned to 
use my fore-brain against them. 

The other optic nerve was con- 
nected as well as my two auditory 
nerves. The Bewegal’s art form was 
completely beyond my understand- 
ing. I had to learn a new language to 
handle the media. It took what seem- 
ed an infinite number of hours under 
the pain-punishment and pleasure 
switches before I could grasp a lan- 
guage which seemed to be completely 

arbitrary nonsense. 

Remember Lewis Carroll’s “’Twas 
Brillig and the Slithy Toves . ?” 
At least he had rhyme and rhythm, 
to make the nonsense enjoyable. To 
me, the Bewegafs art form was a 
meaningless jumble of lights, sounds, 
motions and calculations. 

Of course, I was often called upon 


WE FUSED ONES 


43 



to do the conventional portfaiture or 
scenic type of art; but my job was 
to integrate new combinations of 
lights, sounds and motions. They 
would feed in design characteristics 
desired in the new art piece, then I 
would compute inertia, velocity, ac- 
celeration, color wave-length, vibra- 
tional frequency and energy wave- 
forms. The Bewegal artist’s general 
design parameters were supposed to 
limit my computations. 

I couldn’t help but rebel against 
the whole mess which they called 
art. In rebellion, I deliberately fed 
back some of the unintegrated data 
through my fore-brain from my lower 
brain. My fore-brain, you will remem- 
ber, was the only portion of my 
brain unknown to them. ( I felt that 
since they were feeding garbage into 
me, they should get garbage out, 
while never knowing their design par- 
ameters had been preempted. 

* 

T he Bewegal artists were delighted 
with the result. A new form of 
creativity, they called it; my services 
became much in demand in their art 
world. Fortunately for me and the 
whole human race, no scientist or 
computer technologist learned of my 
peculiar new abilities. 

The important thing was that be- 
cause the fore-brain had the unique 
ability to set up new and novel pat- 
terns of brain-circuit functioning, it 
was capable of self-adaptation. 
Though the. Bewegals had control of 
my consciousness, my perceptic en- 
velope, my logical functions, my pain 
and pleasure centers and so forth, 
they did not have control of the seat 
of my free will! 


Prior to the application of the 
physical sciences to the study of 
brain functioning, we humans had a 
rough time attempting to describe the 
true psychology of a human. 

From the time of Freud on, many 
highly intelligent observers of human 
behavior applied their powers to de- 
scribing a correct psychology. 

These well meaning, shrewd peo- 
ple developed the different schools 
of psychology. From one we got the 
school of motivational psychology, 
from another the school of behavior- 
istic psychology and so on. 

What most failed to visualize was 
the self-adapting mechanism in the 
human’s fore-brain. Before the appli- 
cation of objective physical science 
to the problem, much conjecturing 
was formed on the basis of subjec- 
tive analysis; hence, no matter what 
hypothesis each man .tested, substan- 
tiating evidence could be found in its 
support Why? Because the fore- 
brain’s functions came into play to 
create a set of internal brain circuits 
which were modelled after the very 
hypothesis under consideration. 

This, then, is the feature which I 
used in the school of creative arts; 
I practiced with it until I was an 
expert in more than their form of 
art. I became an expert in mental 
deception. 

Of course, no computer technolo- 
gist would be fooled by my decep- 
tions; but art people could. Now, if 
I could somehow take advantage of 
this ability . ! 

Eventually new models and art 
forms attracted the art world; I was 
moved again. One of the Bewegal’s 
huge forms of flesh extruded a pock- 


44 


IF 





et near its flaring base, lifted me and 
moved me to some unseen type of 
conveyance. After some sixty-five 
years of operation, I had gotten used 
to the idea of always being useful to 
them. To my great surprise, I was 
brought to their equivalent of the 
computer discard pile!

J ohnny here / Becky's time is up . 

We lay on the shelf for fifteen 
years; our consciousness was turned 
off; our biological functions contin- 
ued inexorably and automatically. 
The sleep gave my more primitive 
mind functions an opportunity to in- 
tegrate fully some sixty-five years of 
nearly continuous service as a Fire- 
control computer, scientific comput- 
er, and finally a creative-arts com- 
puter. 

I awoke with the immediate reali- 
zation that, given the proper oppor- 
tunity, I had them beat. As soon as 
I learned my function, I knew my op- 
portunity had arrived; if I could 
only make it work . ! 

My new owner was a child of the 
Bewegal. I was its new toy. General 
purpose jack-plugs of a standardized 
variety had been attached to all of 
my input-output leads, giving this 
child the pleasure of plugging in any 
combination of signals desired. Some- 
times it plugged my output channels 
into my input channels; fortunately 
I had been well constructed. 

I made a handy little pack for the 
child to carry; everywhere it went, 
I was dragged along like some favor- 
ite doll might be on earth. 

One last language was fed into me; 


the Bewegal’s language proved the 
toughest of all. The child taught me; 
knowing very little about the essen- 
tial functions of the pain-pleasure 
centers, it was just as likely to sit on 
the pain center as it was the pleasure 
center. 

Possibly their spoken and recorded 
language could have been easily 
learned if taught by experts. As it 
was, I had my most difficult time 
in some one hundred years as a com- 
puter. 

Little by little as I learned, I placed 
my plan into action. 

B eing a child it had no real con- 
cept of my true capacities and 
limitations. I was, to it, a toy, a tutor 
and an object against which to ex- 
press frustration. It behaved much 
like the small earth boy who loves 
his dog, yet kicks it when frustrated 
and angry. 

The child slowly learned the habit 
of coming to me for an answer to 
its many questions. I was very, very 
careful to insure that each question 
answered was correct and honest. 

Slowly, inevitably, it became over- 
ly dependent on me. 

“How big is the moon?” 

I answered. 

“How do you do this mathema- 
tics?” 

I did it. ( 

“When will the next holiday 
come?” 

I told it. 

At first, it would become quite 
angry when I couldn’t answer all 
questions like the whereabouts of its 
parents. I subtly placed the sug- 
gestion in its mind to place me into 


46 


IF 



the various communication circuits 
' around the house. Then I could keep 
track of where its parents were as 
well as answer many other questions. 

Eventually this huge pile of rot- 
ting flesh-smell, this tiny Bewegal 
child, learned to trust me and my 
answers implicitly. 

As its trust and dependence on me 
grew, I was able to take over all 
of the circuits in the house, includ- 
ing the Chief-house-control comput- 
er as well as all incoming and out- 
going communications. Incapable of 
lying or cheating to any of the Be- 
wegal, it was also incapable of con- 
ceiving of the independence of will 
v/hich was mine; for all this organic- 
computer knew, I was placed into 
its superior control by the intent of 
its adult owners. 

Now my extensive knowledge of 
the Bewegal came into play. I simu- 
lated the receipt of a message to our 
house which ordered my owner’s 
immediate transfer to another star 
system where, ostensibly, he would 
be given bigger and better job du- 
ties. The message cited an emergency 
which required that the Bewegal fam- 
ily move immediately. Passage had 
already been arranged on the proper 
ship which was to lift within the 
hour; all financial losses were to be 
liberally compensated for by his em- 
ployer. 

Of course, the Bewegal society 
isn’t structured precisely the way I’ve 
implied. As with their names, I have 
no human referents which can be 
used to describe the real situation. 

M y new owner called his place 
of business for verification as 


I had anticipated. I was ready for 
his call; through the creative arts 
which I had so successfully learned, 
I was able to feed him the image of 
his employer and all other appropri- 
ate sensory data. 

Shocked, but now convinced, the 
Bewegal obeyed his boss — nay sim- 
ulated image of his boss. 

I had successfully won the first 
step! 

Before I could be unplugged from 
the circuit, I called the ship’s cap- 
tain. For him, I simulated the presi- 
dent of my owner’s business concern. 
I explained the importance of my 
employer’s position and requested 


that he and his family be given every 
freedom and privilege possible while 
on the trip; I hinted at a vague re- 
ward to the ship master. 

Finally, I connected into the trans- 
mission line of the president in ques- 
tion to trigger off a series of compu- 
tations in his Chief-house-control 
computer which would tie it up well 
beyond the hour of departure. I did 
not want to take the risk of further 
checks to his home. 

Now I was prepared to push the 
subtle, carefully built triggers I had 
earlier placed in the Bewegal child’s 
mind. It couldn’t avoid taking me 
along! 

The child grasped me close to its 
leathery, slimy, rotten-smelling body 
until we arrived at the huge ship; the 


ship’s captain gave us every possible 
attention. We were placed near his 
living quarters and allowed to move 
freely throughout the ship. 

I say we moved at our will — ac- 
tually it was my will which motivated 
. and moved the child. How could a 


WE FUSED ONES 


47 



young child of any extra-terrestrial 
descent possibly control a one-hun- 
dred-year-old determined will formed 
under the crucibles of his race's most 
advanced technology as well as the 
tortures of the damned? 

The child was highly, but subtly, 
conditioned to my every nuance. 
From external appearances, I was 
just another toy lugged from corner 
to corner of the ship; but these mo- 
tions were not exactly random. 

H i there ! Vm back I This is Becky . 
Johnny s time was up l 
No, the motions were not random. 
My Fire-control computer training 
made me cognizant of every variation 
of ship's construction. I knew exact- 
ly where the energy supplies had to 
be, where the communication lines 
had to go and where the Master-con- 
trol computer had to be. My object 
was to move back and forth in seem- 
ing child’s play until I came to just 
the right place witjl just the right 
opportunity . 

If I could only make this work . .! 
I needed absolute and complete 
obedience- from the child if the last 
trick was to work. Toward that end, 
I had long ago begun to expand my 
sphere of control over the child. A 
human might describe my actions as 
a form of hypnosis. Whatever it was, 
I used my knowledge of organic- 
computer design from their scientific 
laboratories as well as my knowledge 
of Bewegal creative arts to insinuate 
my will into its mind. Like ail other 
extra-terrestrials, it had no fore-brain; 
hence, once a strongly determined 
will found control, it was easy to 
maintain. 


My greatest fear was of its parents. 
They were old enough and wise 
enough to know how different from 
a genuine toy computer* I behaved. 
Fortunately for me — and the human 
race — they didn’t learn of my pe- 
culiar nature. 

We moved across the ship in our 
random play activities. Somewhere 
near the ship’s Master-control com- 
puter I keyed in the child’s post- 
hypnotic controls. We scrambled to 
the door of the Master-control com- 
puter, entered, then closed the door 
behind us tight. 

Quickly, now, the child pulled out 
every input-output lead of the ship’s 
Master-control computer, replacing 
them with mine. Only billionths of a 
second were required for me to in- 
tegrate and grasp control of the 
total ship, since the Bewegal mon- 
strosity had turned my awareness up 
to full direction. 

My first act was to open all of the 
ship’s doors and locks on empty 
space, keeping locked any door which 
might have provided safety for the 
Bewegal. 

My second act was to make a com- 
partment by compartment check to 
insure the death of every one. 

My third step was to cause some of 
my authentic machinery to place 
their bodies in stasis so that humans 
could study the Bewegal at their 
leisure. 

My fourth step was to recompute 
my direction home! 

XI 

E nroute home, Johnny and I have 
recorded this in the ship’s log: 


48 


IF 



I know there will be many who 
read this log who will feel distress 
and emotion over the loss of that 
pretty, lithe young girl who was I. 

They will grieve over the young 
seventeen-year-old girl who was so 
full of promise for the future. They 
will concern themselves with the trag- 
edy of her one hundred years of tor- 
ture under the Bewegal; where pain 
and pleasure were given to her only 
for satisfaction of their ends; where 
reasoning ability and logical func- 
tions were used to serve only them; 
where freedom to escape through in- 
sanity, sickness or death was denied 
under their will; and where her very 
consciousness was tuned up or down, 
as one would turn the volume knob 
on a radio, for their use. 

Don't do it , my friends! 

That little seventeen-year-old girl 
disappeared long ago; what I am was 
built up from her ashes; and I am 
more than just a young, flirty girl 
now. Johnny, I know, would caution 
you the same from his point of view. 

I bring hope and promise to the 
human race! When they captured me, 
we humans were just beginning our 
long trip through our tiny jsland uni- 
verse, learning its cruel tricks and re- 
wards. One hundred years is aboijt 
the right passage of time for us to 
begin steps into the broad expanses 
of our own galaxy — and beyond. 

Without me, how much more time 
would be needed to make such a step 
safe? 

I bring that safety, not only against 
the Bewegal — for I know them and 
their Achilles’ heels and can show 
how to use the knowledge — but as 
protection against the many other un- 


knowns to be encountered by any 
race as young as ours. 

T o those of you who would grieve 
over the tragic loss of myself 
and Johnny, think of the more tragic 
loss should they have found human- 
ity’s home first! Our people could 
have supplied the Bewegal with a 
huge supply of micro-miniature or- 
ganic computers! 

Think , my friends — what then? 
Now I bring, instead, the Be- 
wegal’s certain downfall. I bring, too, 
the keys to the universe so far as it 
is known to them. These keys will 
go far toward compensating for the 
loss of two small teen-agers, will they 
not? 

I spent seventeen years growing to 
approximately my present shape; I 
spent one hundred years packaged as 
I am now. Which of you, grieving, 
will point to my rectangular box and 
say, “There is that pretty seventeen- 
year-old young girl Rebecca Anne 
Ellents?” 

As Master-control computer for 
this enormous ship, I also have ac- 
cess to sensory data and organic sub- 
control units which place me in a far 
superior position to any more human 
form. Yet I, through the natural 
functioning of my fore-brain, have 
great empathy and identity with the 
human race; I will stay in my new 
position, perhaps to live on and on. 
And on my way, I shall provide ev- 
ery assistance to those of my human 
birthright. 

Then, our next step must be to 
form union with those others who 
have been so cruelly preyed upon by 
the Bewegal! END

JF-MXD WHEN 

by LESTER DEL REY 

How do you truly know 
the what-if you know? 


M ost science-fiction stories are 
based upon one of two questions : 
What would happen if . • .? Or what 
will happen when • • .? The two are 
not interchangeable; each dictates its 
own treatment, and each is dictated 
by 'the basic idea. No sensible writer 
today writes an if story about space 
travel or a when story about a peace- 
ful Utopia created by technology. The 
right question often depends on the 
state of the art at the frontiers of 
science. 

This column will try to cover a few 
of the things going on in both the if 
and when categories of science. And 
since fact and fiction often blur out 
there, I’ll feel free to speculate about 
the ifs and try to relate the whens 
to other facts — whenever I can de- 
termine which category applies. 

Some of the most interesting ideas 
have an annoying habit of refusing to 
fit neatly into either category; others 
simply disappear with no apparent at- 
tempt to follow up on them. The age 


of the universe seemed easily know- 
able when the expanding universe 
was accepted. It was about 2.5 billion 
years. Unfortunately, that turned out 
to be approximately half the age of 
the Solar System, so they had to 
double it Then our Sun turned out 
to be a third generation star, built 
with elements from the wreckage of 
at least two other stellar evolutions, 
which required more time. Currently, 
the estimate is being shoved up to- 
ward 15 billion years — where it be- 
gins to get very sticky to explain by 
the expanding universe theory behind 
it. And some Russian scientists are 
postulating an age of 70 billion years. 
Everything seems to be turning iffy. 

On the other hand, the idea of a 
robot doctor isn’t in the if category 
any more. This week I received a 
sheet detailing fourteen delicate blood 
tests. The tests were performed and 
the report was typed up by an auto- 
mated and computerized laboratory. 
My still human doctor assures me 


50 


that the work done by this robot in- 
stallation is far cheaper and very 
much superior to that done by hu- 
man technicians. From this step to 
the point where the machine asks you 
to stick out your tongue and say erg 
is only a matter of when. 

But whatever happened to Heisen- 
berg’s theory of space being quan- 
tized — of distance coming in tiny 
discrete bits? It was a lovely concept, 
good for a thousand stories — and 
no further mention has been made in 
the ten years since the first news story 
on it. Or what about the research 
which showed that atherosclerosis in 
poultry can be cured by feeding tiny 
amounts of organic vanadium salts? It 
was confirmed by some evidence that 
men spending their lives where such 
salts are in the soil rarely die of 
coronary thrombosis. It should have 
been vastly important. But almost no- 
body seems to have heard about it, 
and there has been no follow-up — 
except among hen breeders. 

S ometimes a key word makes sure 
science gets both press coverage 
and financial backing. Transplants 
have been going on for quite a while. 
The first true transplant was human 
blood — first attempted with sheep 
blood in 1665 and finally successful 
after blood typing was learned in 
1900. It is, after all, the transplanting 
of living cells from one organism to 
another. Bits of bone from calves 
have been successfully used on human 
bodies. 

But now the magic word has come 
into the picture — heart transplants. 
And suddenly everyone is learning 
about the immune reaction of the 


body and the danger of the organism 
rejecting any foreign tissue. That 
made page 1 on all the papers. 

Buried on page 60 in the New 
York Times for January 21 was what 
may be a far more important piece 
of scientific work — one that will af- 
fect all transplants, and perhaps prove 
a key to the whole matter of immun- 
ity and bodily reactions. 

At the University of Texas, a group 
of doctors have been doing one of the 
most difficult transplants — kidney 
transplants from unrelated donors 
who have just died. And in at least 
one case, they have succeeded with- 
out using any drugs or radiation to 
suppress the immune reaction that 
would reject the kidney; in other 
cases, they have used so little drugs 
that the body’s ability to fight infec- 
tion has not been impaired. 

Their technique is to remove most 
of the lymphocytes — the white blood 
cells that circulate in the lymph sys- 
tem. They tap off this fluid and re- 
move 90% of the cells before return- 
ing the fluid to the body. 

Apparently the remaining 10% 
don’t do what they should in theory. 
They don't expend themselves futilely 
trying to get rid of what they consider 
invading tissue. Instead they seem to 
shrug their shoulders and decide it’s 
too much for them; so they cruise 
around the blood doing their other 
work and paying no attention to the 
transplant. 

The normal procedure is to prevent 
rejection by giving steroids and other 
drugs — sometimes plus massive 
doses of radiation — which suppress 
the rejection tendency but also make 
the body incapable of fighting off in-

fection. More patients died from dis- 
ease than from the rejection of trans- 
plants. But the University of Texas 
group has discovered that either the 
10% is enough to take care of all 
normal infections or that the body’s 
method of fighting disease generally 
has nothing to do with lymphocytes, 
contrary to what was believed before. 

I’d like to have a neat explanation 
of how the lympocytes count each 
other and pass on the good word that 
there aren’t enough of them, so why 
bother? The usual picture of these 
cells is that of a savagely dedicated 
worker who flies into a rage at any 
sign of invading tissue and remose- 
lessly charges forward, fearlessly sac- 
rificing itself to save the host body. 
Something funny seems to be going 
on here. 

S omething funny is also going on 
way out there — or perhaps 
part-way out there. 

Quasars are inherently exasperat- 
ing. They don’t seem to fit into the 
rest of what we’ve learned about the 
cosmos. To the radio telescopes, they 
are fantastically bright objects. But 
they have a high rate of red shift — 
their signals have been shifted to a 
far lower frequency than should be 
the case, as would be the case if they 
were fleeing from us at a fantastic 
speed. 

In normal observations of the ex- 
panding universe, such a pronounced 
red shift has always meant that the 
observed object was at the distant lim- 
its of our instruments — billions of 
light-years away. 

The combination of brightness and 
distance presents us with a problem, 


however. Anything that can affect 
our instruments so strongly and which 
lies at the edge of the known uni- 
verse would have to be releasing a 
fantastic amount of energy and would 
be enormous. 

To make things worse, some of 
them are variable, waxing and wan- 
ing in brightness at reasonably short 
periods of time — measurable in 
years, rather than eons. If the body’s 
luminosity changes in a matter of 
years and the body has a diameter of 
even hundreds of light-years, the sig- 
nals that cause the change would have 
to be exceeding the speed of light . 

One quasar, called 3 C 287, appar- 
ently waxes and wanes in size, rather 
than luminosity. Between 1965 and 
1 966, its size increased by 0.2 seconds 
of an arc. 

It was originally assumed to be five 
billion light-years away. But in The 
New Scientist Thomas Matthews sug- 
gests that if (as seems reasonable) 
the increase in size cannot be greater 
in one year than one light-year — 
otherwise C has been exceeded and 
Einstein was wrong — then the 
quasar is no more than a million 
light-years away from us. 

This leaves us with the problem of 
explaining the red shift. One explana- 
tion is that 3C 287 is a fragment of 
some vast explosion that took place 
in our part of the universe and had 
such violence that the quasar was ac- 
celerated to an appreciable fraction of 
the speed of light. If so, there should 
be a great many other signs of such 
an explosion, though no one has sug- 
gested them as yet. 

Otherwise, someone is going to 
have to come up with a new explana-

tion for the red shift other than the 
well-known Doppler effect. 

There has always been a tiny group 
who have refused to accept the red 
sh|ft as evidence that the universe was 
expanding, but their attempts to find 
an alternative explanation haven’t 
come to much. Most scientists have 
found that the theory has worked 
well for everything except quasars. 
However, if there are alternative ex- 
planations for this red shift, then the 
whole matter of the distance of the 
galaxies and the nature of the uni- 
verse will require re-examination. 
There’s still an if buried in our pic- 
ture of the cosmos, it seems. 

A nother almost sacred certainty 
was recently questioned, dealing 
with the impossibility of matter ex- 
ceeding the speed of light. The only 
account I’ve been able to find was in 
the New York Times , as a summary 
of the idea. Naturally, this left out all 
the mathematics and most of the logic 
upon which the idea was based, so I 
can’t even begin to evaluate it. But 
it’s still a fascinating idea. Treated as 
pure science fiction, it would prob- 
ably be a very fine bit of speculation 
in a story. 

The idea is that mass increase 
works fine for matter as we know it. 
But there is other matter which obeys 
a different logic. In this case, the 
mass increases as the velocity is 
slowed toward the speed of light, but 
decreases as the velocity beyond light 
speed is increased — apparently 
reaching rest-mass for our matter 
when it “reaches infinite speed.” 


The professor responsible for this 
interview apparently suggested that 
the creation of such matter might 
make the ideal power source for a 
rocket ship. Matter of this null-c na- 
ture would fogfehow be created in a 
rocket, existing in the one state where 
both kinds ofi matter might impinge 
— at the velocity of light or there- 
abouts. Sonjtegds then, this null-c 
matter wouI3_ immediately begin to 
accelerate towifd near-infinite velo- 
city, giving up its mass to drive the 
^ship. 

I suspect that the professor was 
doing a lot of iffing for which even 
his theory didn’t provide much evi- 
dence in trying to make his null-c 
matter go to work. But the idea of 
having a kind of parity around the 
speed of light is rather intriguing. 

In that case, just as in the matter 
vs. anti-matter case, we might have a 
universe of c-matter and another uni- 
verse of null-c matter. Now precisely 
which is which? How does one go 
about determining whether his uni- 
verse is normally almost at rest and 
gains mass when velocity increases, 
or is almost infinite in velocity and 
gains mass on decelerating? The laws 
we use for most of our determination 
would now be reversed. And so far 
as I know, no one has ever achieved 
provable absolute rest for true rest- 
mass, any more than absolute infinite 
velocity would be achievable in a 
null-c universe. 

Maybe alpha is omega — unless 
that’s much too simple for what seems 
to be an extremely iffy universe.

W hen Major Therensky came out 
of the burnt-out cafe, I blew 
the back of his head off, smearing 
the cobblestones red, gray and hairy. 
He picked himself up and looked at 
me. 

“Whadya do that for. Sears? 
Dammit, I just got back from P&R.” 
Well, I could understand that; it had 
happened to me once, and it’s a 
blasted nuisance, not to mention em- 
barrassing. Those Parts and Replace- 
ment medics made snide remarks 
about your soldiering abilities if it 
happens too often. Which it did. Still, 
I was on duty and couldn’t be sym- 
pathetic. 

“Tough, Therensky. You know the 
Rules.” I handed him my C&K card. 
“Just 'sign and you can head on 


I dont mind killing people — 
even over and over again ! 


back.” It used to be a problem get- 
ting your Captures and Kills to sign 
your card, but the high commands on 
both sides passed down orders that 
got obeyed after a few F.M.’s had 
their quotas raised because the Other 
Side complained. We had full access 
to their P&R files and they to ours, 
so things were kept pretty even after 
that. Therensky signed my card, and 
I left. I looked back to make sure he 
wasn’t going to try a backKiH, but 
he was busy scooping up what he 
could and shoving it in his bag. I 
knew why he was mad. It was be- 
cause of his hair — he had really 
tried hard to keep from losing that 
last batch. 

I skirted the water tower by the 
cemetery, climbed the wall and be- 


54 





gan picking my way through the up- 
rooted gravestones. I almost caught 
it there; a dumdum erased a name 
and buried itself in a tree to my 
right. Some recruit, no doubt, 
getting a little trigger happy. Most 
of the regular F.M.’s were bet-, 
ter shots than that. I waved in the 
direction the bullet had come and 
jumped over the retaining wall on the 
other side. 

Back at division, I turned in the 
day’s batch — four Kills, all signed 
and certified. As I was waiting for 
confirmation, Colonel Skains spotted 
me. 

“Ho, Sears, how’s hunting?” He 
considered himself quite a neck, one 
of the group. He wasn’t but nobody 
bothered to tell him. 

“Four Kills, Colonel.” I turned 
back to the Records table hoping he 
would go away. He didn’t. Instead, 
he picked up my cards and looked 
them over. 

“Hey, you got Therensky ?” Like 
I said, really out of it. 

“Yes, sir, in the back of the head.” 
The colonel wasn’t a Fighting Man, 
just a civil servant, shunted between 
Records and Administration when- 
ever anyone got tired of him. He 
chuckled like a Pro F.M. hitting 
someone in the leg and getting a 
Fatal. 

“Wait’ll I tell the rest of the boys! 
Therensky’ll sure be mad about his 
hair. He’ll never live it down!” Our 
dear, four-cornered colonel. I said 
good-by and left him still chuckling 
and shaking his head. 

I trudged up to the barracks and 
crawled into my bunk without say- 
ing anything to anybody. The reg- 


an IF First 

Each month IF brings you a story 
by a new writer, never before pub- 
lished. This month’s “First” is by Paul 
M. Moffett, a 22-year-old Texan, now 
a graduate student at the University 
of Oklahoma, whose only previous pub- 
lications are “a couple of ‘almost’ 
poems”. A “semi-professional iconoclast 
and general anti-Establishmentarian,” 
Mr. Moffett has been a science-fiction 
fan from the age of 8. 


ular F.M.’s always left you alone 
and you returned the courtesy — 
the Killing a man does is generally 
something he would rather keep to 
himself, even if it wasn’t Permanent. 
I had a couple of Permanents on my 
record, raw recruits who had forgot- 
ten to turn their Life Maintained on, 
and I couldn’t ever forget that. I 
turned over and tried to go to sleep, 
but it was a fruitless venture. I 
kejrt thinking about Therensky and 
his little patch of hair. In an effort 
to get that out of my head, I thought 
about going home. 

G oing home. That’s what most 
F.M.’s thought about, even 
though none of them talked about it. 
Quotas were not mentioned much, 
either. Every F.M. had a quota of 
one thousand Kills or five hundred 
Captures or any proportion of the 
two. The Other Side, the Soviets, had 
had the same quota, so that competi- 
tion was about equal. In fact, every- 
thing about the L-War was about 
equal, and that was the whole idea. 
The Limited War, a famous politi- 


GONE TO GRAVEYARDS, EVERYONE

cian or some such once said, must be 
fought on an equal basis, or it will 
become an Unlimited War as one side 
strives to regain what the other side 
has captured. So we fought on equal 
terms with the Soviets, using up such 
and so amount of war materials a 
week, Killing as many of the Enemy 
as we could, and when we filled our 
quota we were allowed to go home, 
with special honors and a three-credit- 
a-day stipend from the Army. 

Three credits a day isn’t much, but 
most people lived on one credit or 
less, with families. Not that they 
needed it, since the government sup- 
plied all the necessities. But some 
money was necessary to maintain the 
illusion of having some control over 
your own life. You couldn’t be poor 
if you wanted to, and no one had any 
real money worries, but most people 
spent their time bugged about that 
one-credk a day, and husband and 
wife still had terrific battles over the 
finances — all planned by the psy- 
chologists and sociologists, to main- 
tain societal norms and rituals.” 

Of course, that was the whole point 
of the L-War — normality and 
growth, spurred on by continuous 
war. I don’t know the economic and 
psychological theories behind it. But 
somehow, being on a war footing 
kept the economy booming and the 
market gaining, and the soldiering 
kept the malcontents occupied. Dis- 
contented romantics enlisted, and real 
deviants were offered the choice of 
prison or military service. The glory 
of Killing and being Killed was pret- 
ty well played up in the states, but the 
real reason for most enlistments was 
the three-credit stipend. 


The U.S. almost stumbled into 
the L-War back in the Sixties, in Viet- 
nam, but it took the invention of the 
Life Maintainer to really get things 
rolling. Once it became clear that 
there could be no pain and gore, sol- 
diering became an honorable occupa- 
tion, and the little gray box was the 
badge of honor. Some political his- 
torians will tell you that the L-War 
was really a developmental off-shoot 
of Keynes-McNamara economic the- 
ory, as well as the death of real ideo- 
logical differences between the U.S. 
and the Soviet Union. Once there are 
no ideological reasons for war, poli- 
tical-economic reasons became the 
charging factor for fighting — as they 
have always been. Fighting Men 
know the real reasons, though. If 
nobody gets killed, then nobody 
minds fighting. Look at professional 
football. As a simple matter of fact, 
the L-War became a child’s game. 
Bang! you’re dead, but you always 
get up to fight again. 

No one could deny the economic 
factors that did influence the L-War: 
the location, the Australian Outback, 
was a direct result of classical 
Keynes-McNamaran economics: the 
Australian government spent fourteen 
billion dollars converting the Out- 
back into the ideal battleground. 
Ruins, full-scale replicas of major 
cities, an artificial sea created by 
atomic blasts and a full-blown, befog- 
ged bureaucracy dotted, crisscrossed, 
and red-taped the area. It was more 
than any military mind could resist. 
When the Australians pointed out 
that the navies of the world would be 
kept busy supplying the armies, the 
issue was settled. Four new satellites

IF 



were put into twenty-four hour or- 
bits to handle the television coverage 
. and the battles were on. 

There were some problems, of 
course. But nothing that couldn’t be 
ironed out. A few men actually died, 
when their Life Maintained were hit, 
and they weren’t carried back in time 
for resuscitation, but that was cured 
by a new lightweight shield. Large 
weapons were discarded, naturally — 
much to the relief of all concerned. 
Including atomic weapons; such de- 
vices scattered a man entirely too 
thoroughly for rebuilding to be possi- 
ble. Small arms, single-shot rifles and 
the like became the order of the day. 
The F.M.’s made a few improvements 
not covered by the Geneva agree- 
ments — dumdums were reintro- 
duced, raising the Kill score; but since 
there was no pain and no death, it 
was thought that it would be sporting 
to allow such creative efforts to be 
used and the Geneva agreements 
were altered accordingly. 

The only problem that caused any 
great concern after the L-War got 
started was manpower. Realizing that 
the War was phony, most young men 
stopped enlisting and serious short- 
ages ensued. Conscription was tried 
for a while, but was quickly dropped 
in the face of public outrage. It was 
then that the three-credit solution was 
introduced, and the whole country 
went on full governmental control. 
It proved to be a highly acceptable 
solution and the L-War was in busi- 
ness — as was the world. 

F inally I dropped off, only to be 
kicked awake after what seemed 
to be about an hour. It was dawn, 


of course. I had a solitary patrol to 
do. 

I got up, gathered my equipment, 
checked my Life Maintainer to see 
if it was functioning correctly and 
headed down to breakfast. On the 
way I ran into Colonel Skains, who 
followed me down. After only two 
eggs and a steak, I said I was in a 
hurry and left. A short breakfast is 
not a good idea, but the colonel 
could ruin a whole day and get you 
Killed. 

I checked in at Division, and they 
gave the route: a good one I knew, 
around the south end of the Liebe- 
mutter forest, past the warehouse 
and through the wilderness, then 
back. Like I said, a good route, with 
lots of cover. I started off easy. 

Just past the warehouse, on the 
edge of the wilderness, I spotted 
movement. Dropping into a small 
shellhole, I searched the bushes ahead 
of me for a clear shot. 

Abruptly the brush parted and two 
Enemy soldiers stepped into clear 
view. Careless, I thought, and fired. 
A leg flipped up, bodyless, as the 
dumdum tore into flesh. The other 
soldier fell heavily behind a tree. I 
shifted and waited. A head popped up 
and I automatically put a bullet be- 
tween the eyes. The owner of the 
head flopped back and was still. 

I got up cautiously, cursing. That 
head shot would mean I would have 
to lead them back, ruining my patrol 
schedule. On top of that, I would 
have to go through channels to get 
my C&K card validated. It looked 
as though that would be all the Kill- 
ing I would do that day. I walked up 
to where they lay. 


GONE TO GRAVEYARDS, EVERYONE 


57 



They were dead. Permanently. 
Both laid there, still, silent. None 
of the usual cursing, joking. My pro- 
fessional self noted calmly the neat 
job I had done on the one I had shot 
in the head. The other appeared to 
have died from the shock of the im- 
pact. 

Neither had a Life Maintainer. 

1 shook my head trying to clear it, 

clear my eyes of the two dead 
men in front of me. 

Quite abruptly, without any inter- 
vening awareness, I was running in- 
sanely down a road. Ahead was an 
Enemy P&R. I ripped skin off my 
fingers going in the door, collided 
with a heavyset individual with a 
patch of fresh, hairless skin on the 
back of his head: Therensky, just get- 
ting his finishing touches from P&R. 

“Therensky!” Ragged gasps punch- 
ed the name out. “Therensky, there’re 
two of your soldiers out there, dead. 
They didn’t h^ve Life Maintainers! 
Get your P&R men out there, quick!” 
I stopped, unable to go on. Therensky 
signaled two P&R men, who came 
over with a stretcher. 

“Where are they, Sean?” 

“Just past the warehouse. On the 
edge of the wilderness. Two, maybe 
three miles from here.” 

Therensky nodded at the two. As 
they left, I noticed that they weren’t 
carrying spare Life Maintainers. I 
looked at Therensky. 

“Why don’t you have spare Main- 
tainers? How’re they going to save 
those men?” 

“They’re not, Sears.” He pulled 
me to a chair. I sagged into it, grate- 
ful for the chance to relax. He went 


on, “Those men are dead and they’ll 
stay dead.” 

“What? Therensky, you’re crazy, 
you can’t let those men die. You’ve 
got to save them.” I looked at him 
closely. ‘Therensky, you’re joking, 
aren’t you? There must be spare Life 
Maintainers in the truck.” 

He shook his head and looked 
away. 

“No, Sears, no Maintainers. Those 
boys are dead for good.” He looked 
back at me. “It’s a new setup, just in 
from the Supreme Soviet. Your side’ll 
be getting new orders, too. No more 
Life Maintainers will be issued to re- 
cruits, though the recruits won’t know 
that. They’ll think that our super-dup- 
er P&R teams will save them when 
they get hit. ”He stopped and looked at 
me; I shook my head uncomprehend- 
ingly. “It’s quite simple. Sears, really 
it is. What is the whole point of the 
L-War?” Without waiting, he an- 
swered: “To use up materials, to keep 
the economy running smoothly. The 
problem now is that the population 
is beginning to outrun manufacturing. 
There have been a few shortages, here 
and there. Of course, it would be easy 
to speed up output to handle the in- 
creased demand, but then all the cal- 
culations that have been figured for 
the current setup would be invalid 
and we’d have a boom economy. 
There would be all kinds of hell to 
pay straightening that out. I saw what 
he was driving at, but I could not 
bring myself to admit it. He looked 
at me piercingly. “The L-War is to 
consume goods, to keep the economy 
level. 

“The goods we have to consume 
now are men.”

L uke Owens peered through the 
spray at the rocky coast of Is-

he was grinning now, reveling in the

high into the air. Skimming inches 
from the boiling surface the terns fol- 
lowed every crest and trough like 
shadows. 

“What cloud are you on now, 
Boss?” Rudder asked. 

“As if you didn’t know. Why don’t 
we quit when this job’s done and 
buy a fishing smack and — same 
old thing.” The lanky man grinned

wryly and glanced over at the com- 
pass. “Let’s come west a bit, we’re 
getting too far out.” 

“Righto,” replied his companion, 
and after a few seconds grunted. 
“Steering two zero zero.* 

Leaning back on the rail, Luke 
returned to his daydream and ab- 
sently rubbed Rudder’s thick brown 
shoulder. The husky biobot sighed 
gently through his blowhole, and they 
sailed on in silence. 

They made an odd but harmonious 
tableau, those two and their mast- 
less wooden ship, like a postcard 
photo from a dream. Though taller 
and broader than most Isoldans, 
Luke’s fine-boned face and frank 
blue eyes made one think more of an 
old child than a young man. Beside 
him that squat brown Rudder grinned 
permanently from his porpoise’s head 
like a cheerful gnome. Rudder was a 
biological robot designed for a spe- 
cific purpose — to steer a ship — 
and he looked it. 

Fully four feet long, his serpentine 
arms ended in a pair of horny mittens. 
The rest of his smoothskinned body 
was roughly apelike with two re- 
markable exceptions. One was the 
deep bone-rimmed cup between his 
shoulder blades, the other an equally 
bony shelf that ran all the way around 
his hips. 

When in service Rudder would 
stand at the stern of his ship facing 
forward and spread his huge arms 
wide across the deck to grab the 
wooden gunwales. Then he’d back up 
until the end of the tiller bar fit 
snugly into the cup on his back. In 
this position he steered the ship by 
heaving one way or the other with

those awesome arms. When at rest 
they coiled loosely about his waist, 
resting on the hipshelf. 

But while biobots like Rudder 
were common on Isolde where metal 
was so scarce that machinery cost 
twice its weight in gold, Rudder him- 
self was anything but common. In- 
telligent, good natured and in his 
own way even witty, he’d become 
more Luke’s friend than his servant. 

“Hey, Boss, I think I see the Bore. 
South southeast.” 

“Um? So it is.” Luke blinked away 
his idle thoughts. “Now comes the 
rough stuff. Look, Rud, I don’t know 
when it’ll hit us. My guess is as soon 
as we emerge from the Bore in the 
West Ocean, but it could be sooner. 
I have to go below now and wait. 
Now you can — ” 

“No problem. Boss, go ahead. I’ll 
navigate us through the^ channel.” 
“Yeah — but that’s not it. When 
the madness does hit those engines, 
this little ship could get tossed around 
a whole lot. Don’t, repeat, don’t play 
the boy hero and try to resist it. Get 
off the tiller and let her go where 
she will.” 

“Okay.” 

A s Luke went below, Rudder angled 
the slim hull inshore toward the 
eastern mouth of the tidal canal. 
He chirped softly to himself, glad 
for the rare opportunity of piloting 
the ship unsupervised. With a playful 
rhythm he tensed bis right arm, then 
his left and flicked the responsive hull 
in a series of zig-zags. 

“Hey, cut that out,” came a 
muffled voice from below, and the 
biobot grinned and desisted. A re- 

61 



plica of Donald McKay’s Yankee 
Clipper, Luke had said, from that 
distant planet called Earth that was 
supposed to be everybody’s ancestral 
home. Rudder shrugged. It was all 
pretty much beyond him, except that 
the hull was a good one, and here 
every line seemed to have the same 
purpose — to glide through the water 
gracefully enough to dazzle it into 
not resisting. At least that’s the way 
his porpoise’s mind understood it. A 
growing boom of breakers reminded 
him of the job at hand. 

“More spedd, Boss, we’re in the 
current.” 

“Coming up,” was the muffled 
reply. 

D own in the engine room, Luke 
prodded the various flanks of 
the biological muschine to a more 
vigorous pace. He sensed the bow 
rise as the ship surged forward. 
Donald McKay would be amazed at 
all this, he mused as he checked the 
huge muscles. 

Along the centerline of the hull 
was a well that opened into the 
ocean below. Masses of flesh churn- 
ed half-submerged in the pool like 
gargantuan swimmings. Luke made 
his way down the line, giving a pat 
here, a prod there, looking for cuts 
and fatigue and swollen veins. 

Every now and then he stopped 
and inserted a sensor needle in the 
unfeeling flesh and reeled wire from 
it along the deck, to the console 
near the aft bulkhead. After several 
such trips he settled at the console 
and flicked it on. 

The metallic click was an alien 
sound to Luke, whose world revolved 


on wood and muscle; it reminded him 
that the gadget was worth a fortune 
and he’d better not lose it when the 
muschine berserked. If it did. 

This powerplant was a tried and 
true spoked-crank type. A massive 
laminated Ash crankshaft ran from 
one end of the open pool to the 
other, and then out through the stern 
to the propeller. There were six 
throws on the crank, each ringed by 
five radial spokes of pure muscle. 
Each of these was ten feet long and 
three thick and altogether awesome. 
Their outer ends were fixed to the 
ribs and timbers of the ship and gave 
the below-decks area a distinctly an- 
atomical look, like the ribcage of a 
giant. 

Reflections from the turbulent 
water danced on the long wooden 
bulkheads. With the rhythm of strong- 
backs pounding a circus-tent stake, 
the blue-veined, sweating flesh 
heaved round and round. Pervading 
the room was the mingle of stable 
and ocean smells that Luke had come 
to regard as one of the very few 
really unpleasant aspects of his pro- 
fession. 

The ship yawed slightly, forcing 
the man to wedge himself more tight- 
ly in his seat. Must be right in the 
channel now, he thought, and wonder- 
ed how Rudder was making out up 
there. 

The bow rose, hung there for a 
few drunken seconds and fell back 
into the following trough. Except for 
the steady slump slump slump of 
rhythmically churned water, there 
was no sound in the engine room. 
Luke waited with growing uneasi- 
ness.

II 


O n deck Rudder was busy. Like 
all tidal canals, the Bore had the 
unhappy characteristic of never be- 
ing without a strong current. As 
they’d arrived a little past flood tide 
the flow was against them. Calling 
for more power to, ease steerage, the 
biobot began to wish that Luke had 
stayed topside, after all. And he had 
to hurry too, or the receding water 
would leave them stranded halfway 
across the narrow continent 
Isolde’s five per cent of dry land 
was a mountain range that poked its 
rounded shoulders above the waves 
from pole to pole. Though high tide 
linked the Eastern and Western 
Oceans through many passes, this 
particular one ran dry at low tide. 

Churning against the current, they 
inched along between banks of cool 
green trees, farms and barefoot, 
hooky-playing fishermen. Some waved 
to the lone biobot, who so nervily 
ran the Bore single-handed in a 
sixty-foot vessel. 

But for Rudder the worst was soon 
past. Once across the halfway mark 
the current changed direction and 
the helm was much less dodgy. They 
picked up speed, and he called below 
for Luke to cut power. 

L uke wasn’t particularly happy to 
hear the request. It meant they’d 
soon be at the Bore’s western mouth 
where the trouble usually began. But 
after all, he told himself as he re- 
turned the console, that’s why I’m - 
here, isn’t it? 

As Deputy of Biotechnics in 
Isolde’s colonial government, he was 


supposed to find out what was up- 
setting all the muschines over here. 
It had begun a year ago. For about a 
mile in all directions from the Bore’s 
west end, the big biological engines 
of passing ships behaved oddly. Seme 
twitched, some stopped momentarily, 
some stumbled out of synch — and 
last week one had gone wild, wreck- 
ing the ship and causing the death 
of a sailor. 

It happened that that particular 
sailor had been a friend of Luke’s, 
Nikos Sperakos, and the lanky bio- 
tech felt the loss personally. But 
beyond that it was a matter of na- 
tional importance, for Isolde paid her 
way in galactic trade with the fish 
from her oceans. No fish crop for 
even a month meant national poverty, 
for like most colonies Luke’s home 
was far from self-sufficient And you 
couldn’t bring back much of a catch 
in a wrecked boat. 

Blinking redly, the console inform- 
ed him it was warmed up so he cut 
in the recorders. Thinking again of 
Nikos, Luke wondered about the 
shipwreck that had killed his friend. 
Sailors weren’t noted for their histori- 
cal accuracy, but even allowing for 
that, some of the tales told by the 
survivors were fantastic. In essence, 
the main drive muschine — like the 
big six-by-five Luke babysat now 
— had simply gone berserk and torn 
itself to shreds. The ship had gone 
to shreds with it. 

Afterwards Governor Sedlarik had 
ordered all other ships out of the 
area and sent Luke to find out what 
was going on. It was a shoestring 
operation like everything else on 
Isolde. With only ten thousand in- 


THE MUSCHINE 


63 



habitants to tax, the government 
couldn’t afford much else. Luke’s 
knowledge was limited, and he knew 
it. If he couldn’t handle the problem 
>-> they’d have to send back to Earth 
m for technical assistance, a measure 
l everyone wanted to avoid. Terran 
t\ consultants never failed. It was 
legendary — and just as legendary 
were the fees they charged. Man’s 
home planet’s only export was tech- 
nology, and she lived fatly off her 
colonies from it. 

Donning his earphones, Luke 
scanned the rudimentary brains of 
the thirty muscles driving his ship. 
What he was after was a clue to what 
upset them. At first there was noth- 
ing out of the ordinary. 

Not that what was ordinary was 
too pleasant. Cephscan another hu- 
man and you hear pretty much what 
he’s thinking; it isn’t an alien sen- 
sation at all. Cephscan a biobot like 
Rudder and it’s nearly the same thing, 
though more sensual and less coher- 
ent. In a way the more intense sen- 
suality is refreshing. 

But cephscan one of these moronic, 
subanimate muschines and you’re in 
for something else. Most people 
couldn’t stand it. Luke managed only 
from years of professional practice. 
These test-tube monstrosities didn’t 
think, they felt. 

Usually an overwhelming sense of 
power would flow in through the 
headphones, making every fiber in his 
body want to burst. Nothing else, 
just power. Normally. But because 
what few wits they had were strictly 
proportional to their size the big 
ones weren’t always normal. When in- 
dividual muscles exceeded a ton or 


so, higher feelings came into play, 
even a weirdly telepathic sense of 
communication with others of their 
own kind. 

Ego, pain and purpose came 
through too. A fraction of these 
higher feelings flitted among the 
mists of raw power that Luke heard 
now, but not much. These muschines 
were safely under the size where they 
had any minds of their own, to speak 
of. But as always the tiniest voice 
at the back of his mind asked “what 
if — , ” even now as he worked in 
such concentration. 

W hile Luke listened below decks, 
up topside Rudder eased the 
ship out through the Bore’s western 
mouth. 

Feeling the change in current 
through the seat of his pants, Luke 
simultaneously picked up a new note 
in the headphones. He bent tightly 
over the console and checked the 
readings of half a dozen dials. Sense 
of power was full on as usual. In- 
tellect hovered down near zero as 
usual. But the dial labeled com- 
munication began to twitch a bit off 
its lower peg. Pain , zero. Pleasure , 
zero. Luke was forced to concentrate 
on the dials as a point of reference. 
If he relied on the cephscanner’s 
headphones there was a good chance 
of getting lost “in there.” 

As the communication indicator 
rose to two per cent, Luke had a 
definite physical sensation of won- 
der, a what-where feeling. And out- 
ward signs began to appear. Almost 
imperceptibly the huge muscles of 
the engine slowed the became slight- 
ly arhythmic. Shudders of imbalance 


64 


IF 



thrilled through the planking. It got 
steadily worse, becoming noticeable 
even to Rudder up on deck. 

“Boss? You all right?” When Luke 
didn’t answer immediately he raised 
his voice. “Hey, Luke — ” 

“Shut up, will you?” drifted up 
through the hatchway. “I’m trying to 
listen.” 

In his simple way Rudder wel- 
comed the reproof. Things were okay 
after all. He was about to shout 
“Sorry,” when Luke yelled, “Stand 
by, here it comes!” 

T he dials warned Luke, and Luke 
warned Rudder, and it was just 
as well. Every muscle in the mus- 
chine stopped dead. The reaction 
torque nearly spun the ship over on 
its side. Her huge rudder flapped 
in free air, and the uncompensated 
weight of it tore into the biobot’s 
socket. He howled in pain and 
shrugged out of the tiller, nearly 
tumbling over the gunwale which was 
now awash. 

But it was worse by far on Luke. 
The cephscanner poured a gut- 
wrenching sensation of exhaustion 
through the headphones, and he flung 
them down, feeling like he’d swallow- 
ed molten lead. The pain gauge was 
jammed right off the scale. 

From the downcast phones came 
a low moaning, like the deepchested 
protest of a bull at slaughter. The en- 
tire muschine was fibrillating; it 
pulled frantically at its moorings. 
Timbers snapped, and even the mas- 
sive laminated crank began to yield. 
Then it let go like a gunshot and 
filled the air with smoking splinters. 
In writhing silent agony one great 


muscle, larger than the rest, ripped 
itself explosively away from its frag- 
ment of the crank. Blood spouted 
from the wound and sprayed the 
deck with thick scarlet. Dropping 
heavily into the well, it squirmed 
downward, then out into the open 
ocean. Several others followed. 

In two minutes the wreckage was 
over. A half dozen dead and dying 
muscles hung limp and exhausted 
from the timbers they were unable 
to break. The once graceful hull was 
no longer a whole vessel but a 
riddled parody of one. Whole planks 
were gone, and Luke found himself 
waist deep in seconds. 

How he remembered to close up 
the console and scramble topside with 
it before the ship settled was a marvel 
to him later. 

Once the turbulence of the founder- 
ing wooden ship ceased, they swam 
back to her. Luke scrambled up M 
the deckhouse roof and extended a 
hand to Rudder. 

“No thanks. Boss. I twisted my 
knee, and the water feels good.” 

“Yeah? Well, that water’s fuH of 
berserk muschines right now.” 

The biobot groaned and vaulted 
painfully aboard. “What happened 
down there, anyhow?” 

“Tell you later,” Luke muttered, 
wincing as a fresh trickle of salt 
water found its way to an abrasion 
on his side. “Where’d our dinghy 
go?” 

They looked around but couldn’t 
spot the thing. It was designed to 
float free if the ship went down, 
but must have been caught anyway. 
Behind them by a scant mile or so 
was the shore. Luke looked in vain 


THE MUSCHINE

for a fishing boat, then remembered 
that their immediate vicinity was 
quarantined until he “cleared up the 
thing” that caused all the wrecks. 

He smiled ruefully at Rudder. 
“We’ll have to sit tight a while and 
then swim back. How bad’s that leg 
of yours?” 

“I’ll manage.” 

UI 

W hen their horsecart pulled up 
at the ramshackle hotel that was 
Isolde’s capitol building two hours 
later, Emil Sedlarik was out on the 
porch waiting for them. Sedlarik was 
the planet’s governor, an ex-Terran 
spacepilot of sixty who reminded 
Luke of nothing so much as a sawed- 
off shotgun. He took one look at the 
biotech’s tattered jersey and Rud- 
der’s limp and snorted, “Well, scratch 
one ship.” 

‘Too true,” Luke admitted as he 
slogged up the wooden steps, “but 
I’ve got a full recording in here.” He 
tapped the cephscanner that dangled 
heavily from its shoulder strap. 
“Good. Let’s take a look.” 

“Hold on a minute.” Luke looked 
back over his shoulder at the giraffe- 
legged biobot horse that had brought 
them there. “You still free?” 

“Until about two-thirty,” the horse 
replied. 

“Would you mind taking Rudder 
over to Doc Casey’s in Seafield?” 

As the hack clopped out of sight, 
Luke led his boss upstairs to the 
three-room suite where he both lived 
and worked. Isolde was a poor colony, 
and all twenty of her civil servants 
lived together in the old hotel. He 


rummaged in the ice chest for the 
makings of a sandwich. 

“Looks bad, Emil, I'll tell you 
that much right away. Why don’t 
you set up the scanner, there? I’ll only 
be a minute.” 

The tough little man grunted and 
stubbed out his cigar. Taking the 
cephscanner over to Luke’s desk, he 
opened it and removed the tapes. 
Orienting them all to time zero, he 
lit the gas torch behind the viewer 
and cranked them slowly by. Luke 
joined him, a fish-and-cheese mon- 
strosity in his hand. 

They watched five meandering pen- 
lines drift across the screen. ‘That’s 
the spot,” Luke said, pointing. In - 
tellect spiked twice, then held steady 
at twenty. Communication began to 
wander all over the page in some 
kind of repetitive pattern. And pain 
surged to maximum. Luke grimaced, 
remembering. Then all five traces 
dropped back to zero. 

Luke studied the communication 
graph for a minute, then hauled 
down a big gray dictionary-like book 
from over his desk. Riffling back and 
forth through the pages, he oc- 
casionally stopped to refer to the 
graph. After several minutes of this 
Sedlarik got fidgety and lit a fresh 
stogie. “Hurry up, will you?” 

“It’s tough. I’ve got to convert 
this all to Walton-Siegal, and then 
to English. But the gist is, let’s see — 
Stop hurting me and leave this place . 
Escape . Escape ” 

“Sounds a little articulate for a 
muschine, doesn’t it?” the governor 
said sourly. 

Luke pursed his lips and leaned 
away from the desk. “Sure, but look 


66 


IF 



at that IQ. Twenty. That’s supergenius It shipped oars and coasted until the 


level for a muschine. I’ve never seen 
anything like it.” 

“Which means we’ll have to call 
in a Terran consultant?” the little 
man asked. 

Luke shrugged helplessly. “You 
know how they run those colonial 
schools on Terra. They never tell 
you anything about emergencies. Hell 
no, or their fat consultants would be 
out of a job.” 

Sedlarik snorted and shifted his 
cigar to the other side of his mouth. 
“Naturally. And they’ll soak us for 
twenty thousand credits, which is 
about all there is in the treasury.” 
He sighed and pushed himself away 
from the desk. “But I guess we’d bet- 
ter call them.” 

O ne week later a Terran space 
yacht settled down in Capitol 
Town’s harbor, and a man got out. 
His crisp green uniform would have 
cost a fortune on Isolde, and other 
portions of his costume would literal- 
ly have been priceless. With buttons, 
rings, a watch and even a zipper, 
the man carried more metal on him 
than most Isoldans saw in a year. 

And as he waited for the rowboat 
that had headed out to meet him, 
Ambrose Swager was irritatedly mull- 
ing over that fact and others like it. 
He hadn’t wanted this assignment, 
but they’d stuck him with it anyway. 
Isolde indeed. The godforsaken little 
planet was the galactic equivalent of 
a nineteeth-century fishing village. 
Suddenly his eyes widened. They 
wouldn’t! 

But they had. The creature row- 
ing out to meet him was a biobot. 


dinghy’s prow clunked against the 
spherical hull of his yacht. 

“Mr. Swager?” it said. “My boss’s 
tied up in an experiment so he sent 
me to — ” 

“Did he?” Swager said icily as he 
stepped into the boat. He remained 
silent as the creature rowed ashore 
and led the way toward a rickety old 
hotel. 

“Swager?” an oversized yokel said 
as they came into what looked more 
like a kitchen than an office. “I’m 
Luke Owens.” 

A n hour later Luke was well along 
in his explanation of their prob- 
lem. He’d been sizing up the Ter- 
ran consultant as he went along and 
doubted that he’d ever come to like 
the man, but could probably get along 
with him. Thin, medium height. With 
an imperious sort of mouth punctu- 
ating an otherwise esthetically mold- 
ed face. He seemed about thirty and 
in general looked quite fit. 

“But here,” Luke was saying as 
he wound up his story, “You can 
look for yourself.” He led Swager 
over to the graph. 

The Terran cranked through it 
once, nodding silently. “It’s gone a 
bit far.” 

“You sound as if this problem 
crops up all the time.” 

“I does. Stock in trade for a bio- 
technical consultant, you might say.” 
Rudder materialized with a carafe 
of coffee and the two men sat down. 

‘Tell me,” Swager asked thought- 
fully. “Was there a shipwreck, a 
natural one, in the general area of the 
disturbance?” 


THE MUSCHINE 


67 



“Why, yes. Dolan’s ferry went 
down last year when he hit the Bore 
wrong. But what’s that — ?” 

“Only this. The muschinery that 
drove the ferry survived. It crawled 
off and started growing wild some- 
where on the bottom. As you know, 
the stuff lives on seawater, and it’s 
grown way beyond regulation size. 
It’s got a mind of its own, now.” 
Swager took a sip of coffee, 
grimaced and went on. “It’s capable 
of the same things it does when it’s 
domesticated, only more so. The tele- 
pathic link with its brothers develops 
first. It not only knows that every 
other piece of muschinery on the 
planet thinks, it feels what they feel. 
Or rather what they would feel if 
they were as sensitive as it was.” 
Luke traced little circle on the 
arm of his chair. “So that explains 
the message, 'Stop hurting me and get 
out of there . 9 Even -•though the 
muschine in my ship was too un- 
developed to feel any fatigue, the big 
--glob of wild muschinery did.” 

“Exactly,” said the Terran. “That 
wild glob, as you call it, will do 
whatever it can to stop every piece of 
muschinery on Isolde. Every ship 
that floats causes pain to the thing.” 
“Its other talent is mimicry,” 
Swager went on. “It can duplicate 
nearly anything it finds from its own 
flesh, like fish for instance, and send 
them off on errands under telepathic 
control. As a rule these puppets are 
clumsy jobs, but effective.” 

Luke looked up angrily. “Listen, 
I’m supposed to have had good Terran 
training. How come I never even 
heard about all this?” 

The sleek-featured Earthman 


shrugged. “Call it job protection. The 
main thing is we’ve got to find that 
thing and kill it before it grows 
completely out of hand.” He rose and 
stretched. “We can start tomorrow 
morning.” 

“But what if it does get out of 
hand?” 

“That won’t happen,” the thin 
man said curtly. “Now let’s get some 
sleep.” 

IV 

A round six the next morning they 
put to sea near the scene of 
Luke’s previous wreck. Their fishing 
smack was almost an antique, long 
since outmoded by muschinery types. 
Built along the lines of a miniature 
galley, her lower deck held four 
benches and eight sweating biobot 
oarsmen. Topeside, Rudder steered 
while Luke was admiring Swager’s 
expensive Earthside equipment. 
“What’s that?” he asked, pointing. 
“Wireless cephscanner,” the Terran 
said. “It’ll pick up a strong signal 
almost a mile off.” He looked around 
impatiently. “Hey, can’t we get any 
more speed out of this thing?” 

“No,” Luke said flatly. “It’s going 
to be a long day for those guys down 
there.” He ignored the other’s scowl 
and indicated two rifles among the 
gear. “And those?” 

“Spitguns. Shoot a fast sedative or 
else strychnine. They fire the fluid 
out in frozen pellets.” 

There was other equipment too, 
including an environment suit, which 
Luke recognized. “You don’t expect 
to actually go in after this thing, do 
you?” he asked. 


68 


IF 



Swager shrugged. “You never 
know.” 

“Right about here. Boss,” Rudder 
called. 

“Good. Tell the others to knock 
off and drop anchor.” The husky 
biobot disappeared momentarily down 
the hatch, and in a few seconds the 
rowing stopped. From the bow came 
the buzz of a line running out, and 
Luke mentally calculated the depth 
from the sound. Only about a hun- 
dred feet, he decided. 

Swager called to him to toss over 
the decoy, and Luke went aft to 
check over the baby muschine. It 
seemed to have made the trip out in 
good shape and lay curled up in its 
eighty-gallon tub like a huge shell- 
less snail. Beside the tub was an equal- 
ly large wooden cage, reminiscent of 
a lobster trap. At that moment Rud- 
der emerged from below. Bending to 
give Luke a hand with the squirm- 
ing muscle, he said, “They’re all root- 
ing for you, down there. They’ve 
heard talk about converting all the 
muschine-driven fishermen back to 
galleys. That’s pure slave labor for us 
biobots, of course.” 

Luke nodded sympathetically. 
“Well, let’s shift this thing to the 
cage. Careful of those wires, they’re 
expensive.” After they’d locked the 
cage the three of them heaved it 
overboard where it gurgled slowly 
out of sight. Luke paid out about 
sixty feet of line and shock-wire 
simultaneously, and then made fast. 

“You can stay topside if you 
want,” he muttered to the biobot. 
“Just stand clear of the Terran, 
okay?” Luke made his way carefully 
forward, unrolling the two thin wires. 


“There you are,” Swager said. 
“Good. Which one is positive?” 

“No more than seventy volts,” 
Luke cautioned. “It’s young.” As 
Amby shocked the submerged decoy 
Luke saw a mild ripple near the 
stem. “It’s reacting,” he said. “Now 
what?” 

he next move is up to Mus- 
I chine out there. I’ve got the 
scanner focused on our decoy, and 
when the big boy contacts him tele- 
pathically it should register, Just as 
it did with you last week. You just 
keep an eye on the autocoder — ” 
“Autocoder?” 

“Yes, this here. It’ll give a verbal 
translation from Walton-Siegal.” 
Luke shook his head hopelessly. 
The Terrans had altogether too much 
money. Ambrose Swager went on. 

“We’ll keep on sending irregular 
shocks to the decoy, which should 
confuse the thing. All he’s felt so 
far is fatigue, and he’s none too 
bright. Yet.” 

“Yet. So then?” 

“Well, I’m hoping the muschine’ll 
send out a puppet to find out what’s 
going on, probably a fish-mimic or 
something that has eyes and is re- 
latively mobile. We’ll lock onto the 
puppet’s cephtrace then, wound him, 
and hope he runs back home.” 

“And we’ll follow him, find the 
big boy, and kill it,” Luke finished. 
“Very neat.” They fell silent, oc- 
casionally checking the scanner’s 
dials, and waiting. 

A few minutes passed, and Luke 
drifted back to chat with Rudder. 

Rocking gently on the low swells, 
the stubby little ship’s deck grew hot 


THE MUSCHINE

from the sun. Only a few clouds 
marred the sky, and the breeze was 
so light that it didn’t completely 
carry away the smells of the ship her- 
self. Tar, hemp, fish and a musky 
animal odor from below decks. Luke 
relaxed momentarily. 

“Got something,” Swager called. 

Luke went up forward again and 
stuck his head over the Terran’s 
shoulder. “That’s it,” he said im- 
mediately. “That’s the way it began 
last time.” 

“Right. There goes pain. Look at 
intellect ,” the Terran breathed. 
There was a chilly pause. ‘Thirty- 
one,” Luke said, “it’s getting brighter 
by the day.” The autocoder crackled, 
and a mechanical voice said, “Stop 
hurting me and get out away from 
there, go. Free yourself. Stop hurting 
and free yourself — ” and on and on 
for several minutes. 

“Our poor decoy’s probably in 
agony by now,” Luke said and he 
cut the voltage. 

Swager shrugged. “Yes, I guess 
that’s enough. Now we wait for pup- 
pets. Better haul the decoy up to 
sighting leveL” 

Luke did this, assisted by Rudder. 
Now the cage hovered only twenty 
feet down, and they could easily make 
it out. Amby joined him, armed with 
an ordinary pistol. “Anything yet?” 

Luke gave a negative nod, then 
jerked up a hand and said. “Yes, 
look.” 

Moving heavily through the water 
toward the cage was a four foot 
shark. “Think that’s authentic?” 
Luke asked. 

“Don’t know,” Swager replied ten- 
sely. He hunted around on the scan- 


ner for another muschine’s signal, but 
couldn’t find one. “It’s real.” 

The shark was joined by another. 
Enticed by the tidbit inside, they were 
obviously frustrated by the cage and 
began to move in angry circles, snap- 
ping at it. 

“Hey!” Luke pointed to the dial. 
“I think — ” but at that moment 
the water grew dark from a fast rising 
shadow, and the sharks scattered like 
flies. An enormous squid shot into 
view, and Luke could plainly see that 
the creature was hideously abnormal. 
If it was a mimic, it was a damn 
clumsy job. 

I ts tentacles were blunted and thick, 
and it had the wrong number of 
eyes and mouths. It was yellow, not 
brown, and jerked through the water 
like a huge dismemebered hand. 

“That’s it!” Swager shouted and 
fired a shot down into the water, 
aiming for the head. But the air-to- 
water optical shift misled his aim, and 
he only nicked a tentacle. The squid 
didn’t seem to notice and went about 
breaking through the cage. Swager 
bit his lip and fired again more care- 
fully. 

The massive creature paused, and 
trained one of its four dim yellow 
eyes upward, just in time to receive 
the third bullet. 

There was a hiss like a blown 
boiler, and a geyser erupted. The 
whole ship shuddered and took a 
heavy port list. Swager was thrown 
flat on the deck and lost his gun 
as four huge fingers of muscle curled 
up over the gunwale. 

Luke leaped forward to retrieve 
the weapon and was smashed six

breath for it 

Then Rudder stepped in with ■ 

fireax. The biobot’s arms were just as 

powerful as the squid’s and over- 
whelmingly more swift and skillful. 

He freed the Terran in six strokes, 
only to confront two more tentacles |p ;iS

ed his ax arm. Tossing the thing 
aside. Rudder came to grips with his 
antagonist. Luke got groggily to his 
feet and headed for the bow where 
the guns were. 

Ambrose Swager saw it all. He 
saw two massive yellow arms squeeze 
inward and saw two equally massive 
brown ones press outward. The bio- 
bot pressed with muscles that had 
literally shoved whole ships sideways ? 
through the water, but he was tired ’ 1 
now. The squid would inevitably win. 

Rudder turned his agonized porpoise 
face to Swager, calling for help. 

Luke had returned with the snit- ^l/f^ 
gun. Still shaky, he propped himself 
against the deckhouse and put four 
shots into the heaving yellow mass. 

With no more than a single spasmo- 
dic < thrill it collapsed and lay still. 

Rudder staggered away, and Luke J[ 
caught him and took him below. 

They made their way back to 
harbor at Seafield, the bow lifting 
high and unsteady from the massive 
cargo astern. 


THE MUSCHINE 





V 

T hey tied up at a settlement named 
Seafield, near McGlade’s tavern 
and general store. Swager stepped gin- 
gerly to the dock, favoring one leg 
and holding a protective arm against 
his right ribs. 

“Go on up to the pub and eat,” 
Luke said. “I’ll get Rudder and the 
boys busy on the pit right away.” 
In another hour Luke sat on the 
rim of a large crater in the wet sand. 
With obvious repugnance, the eight 
biobots heaved against the squid 
they’d dragged up from the boat, 
and sent it tumbling into the pit. 
Dismissing them with his thanks 
Luke sent the oarsmen trudging tired- 
ly home. Rudder joined him, and they 
sat jpokinj^aeross the pit, out to sea. 

^Eucky you thought to use the 
sedative and not poison,” the biobot 
said. 

“I didn’t,” Luke admitted. “It was 
just luck. Look, there’s no point in 
us both staying here. Why don’t you 
go up with Swager and get lunch?” 
Rudder looked away. “I don’t 
think Mr. Swager would like that.” 
“His tough luck. You just saved 
his neck, remember? He won’t say 
a word.” Rudder looked doubtful, 
but heaved himself erect and scuffed 
up the beach. 

He’d only been gone a few min- 
utes, when down in the hole the false 
squid stirred. It didn’t attempt to 
escape, but rather just lolled deeper 
into the water and cocked, its huge 
head. It seemed to be listening, Luke 
observed. He brought up the spitgun 
and fingered the selector to poison. 
The squid began to lose its shape. 


The tentacles retracted into the pulpy 
skull, and the whole thing became 
amorphous. Luke recognized the fa- 
miliar, fibrous structure of ordinary 
muschinery. It was almost as if the 
distant puppet master had tired of its 
plaything and balled up the clay in 
preparation to make another. 

And suddenly there were six men 
down there, all lying atop one another 
in a pile where the glob of muscle 
had been. They got groggily up, pull- 
ing arm and legs apart from one an- 
other with wet, adhesive sounds. Luke 
got unsteadily to his feet, too shocked 
to shout for help. 

I t occurred to him he might be 
dreaming. 

But no, it made sense enough. A 
squid couldn’t escape from that hole. 
Men could, especially a team of six 
working together. Ignoring Luke, they 
went clumsily but quickly about 
forming a pyramid. Even as they 
worked the clay that made them was 
molding itself into more definite lines. 
Luke’s hackles rose, for he began 
to recognize something disquietingly 
familiar — and wrong — with those 
figures. 

As the first puppet scrambled over 
the edge, Luke recognized it. Nikos 
Sperakos, his old friend. The Mus- 
chine must have got hold of the 
dead man’s drowned corpse and faith- 
fully mimicked it. Luke fired, and the 
thing dropped. The second came 
over the rim and raised a beseeching 
hand, but Luke put a pellet of poison 
right between its eyes. 

Then he backed quickly away, be- 
cause the next three came over in 
a group. Thirty feet away only two

larynx could still talk, after a fash- 
ion. 

“Damn,” Swager muttered under 
his breath, “but that’s an awful good 
job of mimicry.” 

The zombie moved slowly to one 
side and hunched down awkwardly 
in another of McGlade’s booths. 
‘Talg?” it asked. 

“Who are you?” the Terran asked, 
and rose to stand over it. He passed 
the spitgun back to Luke. 

“Nikos Sperakos, I told you,” 
Luke mumbled at his shoulder. 

“I know that,” the thin man 
answered irritably. “Just feeling him 
out.” 

“Negos Spuh’agus,” the puppet was 
answering. 

li j l“^re,you a sailor, Nikos?” 

; , ; “$elqr, yuhl,” assented the warp- 
ed vocal cords. 

“Where did you come from?” 

‘There. Ship went dow’, tuh weeks 
ago.” He pointed out through the big 
windovf behind the bar to the wide 
West Ocean where his ship had been 
wrecked. The wrinkled hand fell back 
to his lap with a damp plop. 

/ Ambrose Swager took a deep 
breath. “Do you know you’re not 
really Nikos? Do you know that 
you’re a copy, a piece of muschi- 
nery?” 

The watersoaked features pursed 
in the charade of a frown. “Both," 
it finally said. “Am both. Thingso, 
an’way.” It held up a hand. 

They waited. 

“Message,” it burbled. 

“Yes?” 

“Stop muschines. They hurt — * 
me, no — they hurt home." The 
frown cleared, and it repelled In a 


slightly higher voice. “They hurt 
home” 

“Isolde runs on muschines, Nikos. 
You know — knew — that,” Luke 
said. “We can’t just go out and stop 
them all.” 

There was another long silence, 
as the distant puppet master sorted 
through the half-erased memory of a 
drowned man for the word it need- 
ed. 

“Kill,” said Nikos Sperakos. “Kill 
everyone.” His features went muddy 
as the dull homogeneity of his real 
substance showed through. A real ef- 
fort for the puppeteer, Luke thought. 

“If we don’t stop the muschines?” 
Swager asked. 

Nikos Sperakos tapped himself on 
the chest. “I kill. And other lige me, 
we do.” Standing up, he came slow- 
ly toward the Terran. 

Swager backed away. “Go ahead, 
Luke, use the sedative.” 

The puppet leaped as Luke fired 
and was unconscious by the time it 
hit the Terran. Swager hurled the 
clammy creature aside with a curse. 

Luke stared openmouthed as it de- 
volved in to the familiar sluglike 
structure of raw muscle. Then he 
followed Swager out of the building. 
McGlade stood in the doorway, his 
eyes wide. 

“Just leave it where it is,” the 
Terran called over his shoulder. 
“We’ll be back for it,” and then to 
Luke. “Look, things are getting out 
of hand. That’s the best mimic I’ve 
ever seen. The big glob out there 
must be growing at the rate of tons 
per day, and its intelligence’ll be on 
a par with our own in no time. I’m 
going back over to Capitol Town

to get my ship. It’s got a betagun. 
We’ll never kill this thing with 
poison now.” 

“All right,” Luke said. “Hey, 
Rudder, run around back and get us 
Big Jake’s hack, will you?” As the 
bulky biobot trotted out of sight 
around the building, Luke turned 
back to the Terran. 

“Hold on though. I can’t have 
you irradiating the thing, even if it 
is too big to poison. Those betaguns 
leave an awfully dirty wake, don’t 
they? You could wipe out half the 
fish in the ocean with the contami- 
nation from a single shot. The wild- 
life on Isolde has a very low toler- 
ance, you know. They’ve never been 
exposed to even mild radiation.” 
Swager rubbed his forehead. “I 
know. It’s rough. But judging by 
some of the others I’ve seen, our 
Muschine could be, oh, as big as a 
building. There’s a chance even the 
betagun won’t work, and we’ll have 
to go to a small bomb.” 

“Hell,” said Luke, “that’d be as 
good as an eviction notice to every 
colonist on the planet. All we have 
to do is miss one year’s sea harvest 
and we’re dead, economically. We’d 
all have to leave Isolde and resettle 
somewhere else.” 

The Terran nodded grimly. “Well, 
let’s hope the betagun works then.” 
Rudder appeared, accompanied by 
a ten-foot-tall horse pulling a high- 
wheeled trap. Swager vaulted in and 
looked perplexedly about. 

“Where’re the reins?” he asked. 
The biobot horse turned a disgusted 
muzzle back toward the Terran and 
said, “Just tell me where you want 
to go — sir.” 


“The government house in Capitol 
Town,” Luke called up to him. “And 
take it easy on him, he’s not used to 
our roads.” With a snort more hu- 
man than horselike, the lanky animal 
set off down the road at a good 
thirty knots. Swager’s bright green 
uniform faded out of sight, jolting 
up and down at every bump. 

L uke went back inside. With Rud- 
der’s assistance, he trussed up 
the unconscious puppet, and they 
carried it down to a rowboat tied at 
the pier. Then they sat there, side by 
side, looking out into the water and 
not saying much. 

About an hour had passed when 
from overhead came a hushed hum, 
which grew steadily louder. Thai a 
plain black sphere came into view 
from the direction of Capitol Town. 

“Swager’s ship,” Luke commented. 
Rudder nodded. It descended into the 
waves a quarter-mile offshore, sink- 
ing until only the very topmost 
curvature was visible. A hatch open- 
ed, and not one but two men stepped 
out. “Looks like the governor. Must 
have come along to make sure Swa- 
ger’s giving us our twenty thousand 
credits worth.” 

They got in the dinghy and rowed 
out to the Terran ship. Sedlarik 
caught their painter. “Hello,” he said 
gruffly. “Just thought I’d come along 
to lend a hand.” 

They swung the carcass of un- 
conscious muscle aboard. Rudder 
peered curiously into the hatch. “It’s 
a hell of a ship, you know,” Sed- 
larik said. “Just lllb those old Ter- 
ran fighters I used to fly when I 
was a kid.” 


THE MUSCHINE 


75 



Luke grunted and sprang aboard. 
He was the last. And now three 
people, a mansized biobot and a two- 
hundred-pound chunk of muscle were 
crowded on the bobbing curve of the 
ship. “All right, Swager, what’s the 
drill from here?” 

“Simple. First off, you guys clear 
out. Get into the dinghy and go cool 
your heels in McGlade’s. I’ll wake up 
this puppet here, toss him down from 
the ship into the ocean near our last 
incident, and then I’ll follow him 
home.” 

“Alone?” asked Luke. 

“Alone. That’s what you’re paying 
me for. But I’ll be back in an hour 
or two. Before dark, anyway. Wait 
in McGlade’s.” 

There was a short embarrassed 
silence. “Once I’ve found the big 
Muschine out there,” Swager went 
on, “I’ll submerge and burn it to 
death. And I’ve been thinking about 
contamination.” 

Luke raised his brows. 

“Maybe it can be minimized for 
the sake of Isolde’s fishing crop. I’ll 
get right on top of the thing and 
try to use a low dosage.” 

“That’s the hard way, of course,” 
Luke said. “You’re sure you don’t 
want some help?” 

“No, you’d really just be in the 
way.” 

Luke clapped the man awkwardly 
on the shoulder, then turned and 
hopped back into the dinghy. The 
other two joined him. Rowing away, 
they heard the hum again. A slight 
wake came as the big hull eased up 
out of the water. It headed out to sea 
a few feet over the water, just clipping 
the waves. 


VI 

I t seemed to Luke they’d been in 
McGlade’s much too long, but the 
feeling was a dull one. Luke was on 
his way to being slightly drunk and 
everything was dull. For a while ear- 
lier he’d played cards with Sedlarik, 
but the old man had long since gone 
off to bed. 

Now he sat at the bar with his 
chin in his hands. Behind him Rudder 
was asleep in a big wooden chair by 
the door. A few of Jake’s regulars 
had come and gone, but on the whole 
the place stayed quiet and empty. 
After all, it was a weekday night. 
Luke had taken to walking around 
behind the bar to draw his own 
beer. Jake didn’t mind, since his 
dozing was the less interrupted for 
it 

At about one o’clock the big 
innkeeper roused himself and yawn- 
ed. “Hey, when’re you going to bed 
and give an honest man some sleep?” 
“Aw, go on up, yourself, Jake. 
I’ll lock up.” 

Jake was about to get up when 
the doors banged open and Ambrose 
Swager staggered in. Rudder tumbled 
out of his chair. For one frozen 
second no one spoke or moved. 

The Terran’s face was cut, and the 
blood contrasted strongly with his 
pallor. His breath came in gasps. His 
left leg dragged at an unnatural 
angle from its knee. The bright green 
pantleg was ripped and soaked with 
more blood. 

Rushing over to him, Big Jake and 
Luke guided the man to a chair. 
“Thanks,” he wheezed, then grimaced 
and put a hand to his throat. 


76 


IF 



“Well?” Luke asked him tensely. 
“It didn’t work,” Swager rasped. 
“I got too close and actually brushed 
against the thing. It’s immense, you 
wouldn’t believe it. Like a submarine 
mountain of flesh. It absorbed the 
ship like a snake swallowing an egg. 
I cut in full propulsion and blasted 
out, but it’d cracked the hull in a 
dozen places, even so. It tossed the 
ship around like a pingpong ball — ” 
“Jake, is that leg broken or twist- 
ed?” Luke asked, and they both knelt 
to examine it. It seemed only badly 
wrenched. Roused by the ruckus, 
Emil Sedlarik had come sleepily out 
of his room to join them. 

The wounded Terran was close to 
passing out. Luke shook him gently. 
“And the betagun?” he asked. “Did 
you give him a good dose of radi- 
ation?” 

Swager blinked, his face working. 
“Didn’t faze him. Soaked it up like a 
sponge. It’s grown completely out of 
hand — we’ll have to bomb it.” 

The governor shook his. gray head 
slowly. “What’s the point? Do that 
and no more fish. It’d be simpler to 
just pack up and leave.” 

Swager was unconscious now. Jake 
looked up from where he was bind- 
ing the man’s leg. “Better get Doc 
Casey.” 

“Right,” Luke said, heading for 
the door. “Come on, Rud, let’s take 
a walk.” 

I solde’s only medic lived a mile or 
so down the beach from Mc- 
Glade’s. Scuffing through the dark 
sand, Luke began to notice the faint- 
est glow of predawn lightness in the 
East. He paused now and then to 


look out to sea, or inland at the little 
cottages of people he’d known most 
of his life. He wondered if some of 
them, the older ones, would be able 
to pick up and resettle at all. And he 
wondered if they’d blame him, once 
they knew. 

Yet Luke knew it wasn’t his fault, 
or even Ambrose Swager’s. The fault 
lay in the carefully regulated depen- 
dency Terra imposed on her colonies. 
Swager at the moment was as much a 
victim of it as the rest of them. He 
was paying in pain that very minute, 
and remembering this, Luke quicken- 
ed his steps along the darkened 
beach. 

But Swager was above it all, and 
Luke resented the man’s immunity. 
He’d just apologize, refund the fee 
maybe, and go off to the next little 
planet that needed him. And could 
afford him. 

Pausing on a low dune, he and 
Rudder peered out into the water at 
the silhouette of the space yacht. 
Nothing much showed, as usual, just 
the upper curve of a sixty-foot sphere 
rose above the swells. 

Funny, Luke thought, it looks per- 
fectly okay. But Swager had said the 
Muschine had holed it. 

“What’s the trouble, Boss?” Rud- 
der asked, seeing his frown. The up- 
per limb of Isolde’s sun crept over 
the hills beehind them, and for an 
instant the whole world was totally 
pink. 

“Nothing, Rud.” Luke wished his 
head was clearer. He labored with his 
thoughts like a ten year old with a 
medicine ball. “Where’s the washup, 
Rud? Around here, I mean. Where’s 
all the debris come to shore?” 


THE MUSCHINE 


77 



The biobot shuffled his arms on 
his hipshelf, a gesture Luke had come 
to relate to a human’s wrinkling his 
brow. 

“Down by the Bore, I think, Boss. 
Where we came through the first day. 
About a mile on the other side of 
McGlade’s.” 

Luke turned around. “Let’s head 
over to it then. I want to see what’s 
washed ashore this morning.” 

“But the doctor, Boss. Mr. Swa- 
ger’s — ” 

That stopped Luke cold. Swager. 
Ambrose Swager was back with the 
governor and Jake. All at once he 
was sprinting back the way they’d 
come. Rudder stumping behind on 
tired legs. 

They burst through Jake’s swinging 
doorsi The Terran lay on a cot be- 
neath the window, where Emil and 
Jake worked over the cuts on his 
face. 

“Luke, whatever — ?” 

“Get away from him, quick!” 
Luke was across the room in two 
strides and pushed them both away. 
“Guard the door. This thing isn’t 
sick, it’s dead.” 

Hurriedly grabbing the cot by 
its foot, he heaved it over and dumped 
the Terran to the floor. 

“Get up.” 

With much more agility than his 
wounds would seem to allow, Am- 
brose Swager scrambled to his feet. 
The thin face was as quick and ex- 
pressive as ever, but it was pale. In 
his own way the Terran was even 
more horrible than Nikos Sperakos 
had been. 

“You know, then,” said the Ma- 
chine's puppet 


F or an answer Luke picked up a 
chair and with a grunt wrenched 
off a thick maple leg. “Swager’s ship 
was roughed up by the big Mus- 
chine,” he said grimly. “But it more 
than cracked a few seams. It must 
have opened a rent large enough in 
the hull to reach in and yank out 
the pilot.” 

He advanced slowly across the 
floor toward the puppet his voice a 
compressed whisper. 

“You killed him. And mimicked 
him.” 

“Now wait a minute, Luke,” said 
the Terran, backing away. “You’re , 
wrong. I gave that thing a fat dose 
of radiation and — ” 

“Bull. I’ll bet Swager never had a 
chance to squeeze off a shot before 
it — you — got him. You’re afraid 
of that betagun, all right. This whole 
ruse is to keep us from trying an- 
other shot isn’t it?” Luke taunted, 
slowly following the retreating puppet 
around the cot 

Suddenly it stopped. “Okay,” it 
said with a trace of the old Terran 
arrogance. “But my ship was wreck- 
ed, and it carried the only betagun on 
Isolde. By the time you can get 
another down on this godforsaken 
little planet I’ll have grown to the 
proportions where you will have to 
use a bomb, after all. So nothing’s 
changed, has it?” 

“We’ll find the ship, wherever it’s 
washed up, and get the gun.” Sud- 
denly Luke couldn’t stand it any 
more. Taking one swift step forward 
he clubbed the thing full in its chest. 
Air left lungs that didn’t really know 
what breathing was for, and it went 
down. He bashed it twice more.

IP 



The sharply handsome features of 
Ambrose Swager spread, became 
fibrous, and there was nothing but a 
sluglike bundle of muschinery, in- 
human, uncaring. 

Tossing aside the cudgel he turn- 
ed to Rudder and the governor. 
“We’ve got to move fast,” he said, 
heading for the door. “We’ve got to 
find Swager’s ship.” 

“But wasn’t that it?” Rudder ask- 
ed as he trotted terrier-like at Luke’s 
heels. The biobot pointed out to where 
the sphere they’d seen earlier had 
been. It was gone now. 

“No,” Luke puffed between heavy 
footfalls. “That was the Muschine 
itself, the whole big mass of it, 
mimicking the ship. It had to stay 
close by to control that puppet of 
Swager.” 

T hey ran along the hard, moist 
sand at the water’s edge, but 
even so their pace grew steadily slow- 
er. Luke himself felt close to exhaus- 
tion. Birds were up now, and there 
was a sliver of open sky between the 
sun and the eastern horizon. 

“There, Boss, up ahead.” Rudder 
pointed to where thick green trees had 
spread right down to the ocean’s edge, 
marking the tidal canal. The morning 
flood swept through, driving the water 
far inland toward the other ocean. 
Tons of debris moved with it. Stop- 
ping on a low coral bank, they 
scanned the churning masses of drift- 
wood and kelp. 

“Look,” puffed the governor, 
pointing. Bumping heavily along the 
bottom, a smooth-surfaced something 
occasionally showed above the waves. 
It was fifty yards offshore. 


“That’s it okay,” Luke said, and 
he looked down at Rudder. “If you 
could get to the exhaust pump — ” 
“Think he’d know one if he saw 
it?” the old man cut in. He described 
the thing, and with a quick nod 
Rudder leaped into the water. His 
smooth brown head was soon at the 
ship and then vanished as he dived. 

“He’s been down a long time,” 
the governor muttered a few minutes 
later. 

Luke nodded dubiously. “Well, he 
is sort of a porpoise, you know.” 
Then their attention snapped to the 
ship again. With a rumbling hiss the 
whole surface around it erupted in 
bubbles. Its broad curvature slowly 
rose higher. 

As the hissing stopped the hatch 
flew open and Rudder, coughing and 
gasping, crawled out. 

“Emil, can you make it out there?” 
The old man snorted contemptous- 
ly and was in the water before Luke 
was. The current was stiff and kelp 
fouled their arms at every stroke, but 
they were at the ship in; five minutes. 

Rudder was still recovering. 
Thumping his broad back, Luke told 
him to return to McGlade’s. The 
biobot nodded tiredly and fumbled 
back into the water, headed for shore. 
Luke lowered himself through the 
hatch where Emil had already gone. 

“Hull’s sprung in a dozen places,” 
the old man said, “but most of the 
stuff’s okay. Only big hole’s right 
here on the conning bridge. Must be 
where it reached in for Swager.” 
“Will it fly?” 

“Don’t know. Hold on.” 

“Hurry.” Luke helped the old 
ex-pilot cram himself through the 


THE MUSCHINE 


79 



hatchway into the engine room. Then 
he waited, humming nervously and 
pacing the deck to keep from falling 
asleep on his feet. 

“S’okay,” boomed a hollow voice 
from below decks. The governor’s 
head appeared through the hatch 
again. “I’ve kicked ^it all into emer- 
gency override,” he said, hauling him- 
self out “Sort of like putting a penny 
behind a fuse. But it’ll go until every- 
thing burns out. Here, let me into that 
conn chair.” 

T he black sphere rose unsteadily 
over the waves, water pouring 
out from a dozen split seams where 
it had leaked in. The hum had 
raspy overtones this time, even 
Luke’s inexperienced ear could hear 
that But it ; moved, and by Isoldan 
standards it moved fast. 

“Okay, Luke, there’s McGlade’s. 
No, look through this screen here. 
But where’s the Muschine?” 

“Head out to sea. Straight out” 
The two men strained their eyes 
into the screen. Then Sedlarik let 
out his breath. “My God!” 

Moving ponderously offshore was 
what looked like brown jellyfish about 
a hundred and fifty feet across. 

“It’s already gone several miles,” 
Luke said. “Must have left the min- 
ute I nailed Swager.” 

The governor had already turned 
and was fuming with a handful of 
inoperative controls. “Betagun’s out,” 
he growled. “Wouldn’t you know? 
Listen, Luke, hold her on course and 
I’ll go below and see if I can trigger 
It from there. That’s elevation to your 
left, the green knob is attitude. 
Okay?” 


As Luke nodded uncertainly Emil 
wedged himself back down the hole. 

“Watch it!” he roared as Luke in- 
advertently rolled their crippled ship 
thirty degrees. After managing to 
right them, Luke eased jerkily lower 
over the water, to better see the rene- 
gade Muschine. 

“It’ll work, I think,” the governor 
called. “Line up the crosshairs at the 
top of your screen.” 

Luke did so. They were directly 
over it now, “Ready,” he shouted. 

“Right. Okay — we’re firing.” 

Luke could just pick out the faint 
finger of light that pointed down to 
the thing in the water. 

The thing stopped, quivered, and 
its mass contracted into a large cen- 
tral lump. Smoke and steam rose 
from its upper skin where the beta 
particles burned into it. The surface 
grew black. And still it was contract- 
ing. Why? 

The reason hit Luke; and Luke hit 
the elevator just in time. The Mus- 
chine lunged. Of course, this is what 
happened to Swager! Like a gigantic 
fleshy mitten the great ball of muscle 
groped a hundred feet into the air. 

“What the hell gives?” Emil 
howled from below. 

“Evasion action. We’re still not 
out!” Luke dodged the ship clumsily 
to the right and tried to realign the 
crosshairs. The main drive hum was 
louder and more unsteady, and he re- 
alized suddenly that the cabin was 
very hot. 

“One more shot is all we get, 
Luke,” the governor called. “And 
maybe not even — ” 

“Fire!” 

Once again the blue beam poured 

IF

( 










into the mass of flesh below. Frag- 
ments of the thing fell away in 
charred layers. The gigantic hand 
contracted to a palsied fist. They had 
it. 

Abruptly the beam flickered out. 
Luke guided them a hundred yards 
east and set the overheated ship down 
in the cool ocean water. Emil emerged 
from the hatch, groaned, and passed 
out. His shoesoles were on fire, and 
his hands were charred black. 

VII 

E mil Sedlarik frowned. Careful 
with his bandaged hands, he 
poured Luke and himself a second 
brandy from the legendary square 
bottle that so few of his guests ever 
saw. From where they sat on the old 
hotel's wide veranda, they could hear 
sounds within of other people fin- 
ishing dinner. 

“So you think I could pay for 
repairs on the hull by selling some of 
that fancy equipment inside?” Luke 
was asking. 


“Probably. And I could probably 
teach you to fly it. But the whole 
idea still sounds crazy. Suppose you 
run into some Terrans, and they want 
Swager’s ship back?” 

Luke sighed and slouched back 
in the big wicker chair. “Then we 
take our lumps, I guess. But if we 
can save even one other colony the 
trouble we went through, it’ll be worth 
it” He grinned across at Rudder, 
who was leaning on the porch rail. 
“And we sure won’t charge Terran 
prices, either.” 

The governor shook his head. 
“Freelance consultant,” he growled. 
“Sounds more like the Lone 
Ranger.” 

They were silent for a while. A 
fisherman and his son went by in 
the dusk, a newly mended net strung 
between them. The governor returned 
their wave, and watched them pass 
quickly down to the harbor, hurrying 
to be ready for the morning.

IF • Short Story 


by basil wells 

^ hill) ol'tk'.f 

Vahni was sea-born fo a land 


of enemies , ancient — and new l 


V ahni and a thousand others like 
her came up out of the early 
dawn sea. Before them the beach was 
broad and pink in the vast sun’s 
golden flood. Upon the waiting 
smooth bosom of the packed sands 
were strewn the crescents, the discs 
and the polished stars of the Great 
Sea’s shell debris. 

White bones of driftwood spun a 
froth of jumbled lace along the soft- 
ly pulsing rim of the satiny pale sea. 

Across the beach orange-and-pur- 
ple-flowered grasslands sloped evenly 
upward for many miles. Only here, 
close along the beach, was there 
a narrow belt of mauve-hued arbora- 
ceous ferns. And beyond the half- 
mile belt of trees lay the gleaming 


towers of the moated city of Torbo- 
tha. / .IK," 

There young Vahni, so recently a 
thoughtless playful finlin lacking any 
mental contact with her childish com- 
panions, would be welcomed by a 
parent, or parents, assigned her by the 
Allwise Council. 

Since she had broken the shell and 
had been bom in the sunken nursery 
beneath the barren offshore island of 
Hod, she had never set foot on the 
main island of Botha. For fifteen 
circuits of Turm about the golden 
sun she had studied and played and 
worked to prepare for this. 

“It is most beautiful!’ 1 cried 
Vahni, her full purple lips indrawn 
and upthrust into the expressive 


83 








ezlaa triangle of pleasure so charac- 
teristic of the People. 

About her the young Turmans and 
their scattering of older, rigid-shelled 
guardians were also eztaaing and ex- 
pressing their excitement and pleas- 
ure by clakking their horny-plated 
arms against the resonant belly-plat- 
ings of their plastrons. 

“So clean, so bright!” she heard 
their piping, fresh voices exclaiming, 
and with her imperfect inner recep- 
tiveness — newborn scant weeks ear- 
lier — she caught the unvoiced joy- 
ful thoughts of the wrinkled older 
People nearby. 

Together the hundreds of Vahni’s 
companions ran across the pink grit- 
ty wideness of beach. Short and 
scjuat of body they were, their water- 
gleaming carapaces and plastrons like 
blue-mottled bronze. From their wide 
froglike mouths and triple-hooded 
eyes they shook the saline drops even 
as they hurried forward. 

A bruptly Vahni’s blissful eztaa of 
happiness dissolved into the ex- 
truded downpointed triangular lips of 
despair and hatred. She cried out in 
sudden pain and misery, and about 
her all the young of the recently 
hatched People also gave voice in a 
like manner. 

The illusion of beauty and cleanli- 
ness over the sunlit land was a mock- 
ery. For over all the major land 
masses of Turm there swarmed and 
multiplied the hidden tiny drinkers 
of blood, lymph and any living tender 
flesh — the miniature vermin known 
as lilfs. 

Against their relentless, unending 
assaults the Turmans had constructed 


their water-filled moats and launched 
their most intensive mental deterrents. 
Only in the Great Sea or in their 
cities was there escape from them. 

Even in her excitement over the 
imminent acquisition of a home and 
of parents, she could not entirely 
ignore the inroads of the lilfs. They 
swarmed up over her sturdy, horny- 
plated legs and over her lower and 
upper body shells, searching for the 
soft warmth and fluid nutrients on 
which they thrive. 

Vahni writhed in utter misery. 
Vainly she tried to copy the stoicism 
of the oldsters guiding the new 
adults. She must act like a near 
adult and put from her the discom- 
forts of the march. 

Yet she found herself wishing that 
fhe party had journeyed the addition- 
al nine hundred hets — the three- 
foot height of an adwlt Turman was 
one het — and swum up the River 
01 to the water gate of Torbotha. 

She caught the thought waves of 
older Turmans, especially those of 
Welm and Havn. Every day, it seem- 
ed, her erratic powers of reception 
improved. To them the massive red 
walls and the low broad domes of 
ivory and pale gold were the home 
to which they were returning after 
years of exile. 

Old Welm wept silently, his wa- 
tery yellowish eyes bulging like over- 
ripe sea plums. Havn’s wrinkled face 
and thin bluish lips were twisted into 
a crooked, eztaaing mask as he hob- 
bled along beside his equally aged 
crony. 

The thoughts! They came flood- 
ing .. 

“To roam under the white moons 

IF 


84 



again . Free under the sun . 
No more dreary caverns ... To be 
free of shell-soiled demons in finlin 
form ...” 

As suddenly as it had opened, her 
inner mental ear was closed. Now she 
heard only the disjointed words, 
pantings and involuntary clakking of 
horny limb against horny plastron as 
the group moved on. 

So they came at last to the sunken 
gates of the outer moat, and passed 
slowly through. As they went, they 
frequently immersed their upper bod- 
ies and heads until they reached the 
upward ramp. 

Thus were they cleansed of the ac- 
cumulation of crusted lilfs. 

Within the inner walls, thousands 
of Turmans crowded the shady pla- 
zas. Vahni saw gleaming walls of 
ebony, scarlet, orange, green and pale 
ivory that climbed like waves of 
frozen, tinted water to the curving 
low domes above. Underfoot the inter- 
locking patterns of the crimson and 
white paving stones shone clear. 

In the center of the innermost 
plaza loomed a vast and ugly globe 
of scarred, pitted metal, blotched 
with streaks of reddish rust. It was so 
alien to the People’s sense of beauty 
that Vahni was impelled to question 
old Welm about it. 

“See where those stubby legs sup- 
port the globe?” old Welm said. 
“Just above a glimpse of the central 
lake.” 

“Yes. There is a sort of door — 
an oval barred space.” 

“And at the base and above the 
legs? See how blackened and soiled?” 

Quick comprehension came to 
Vahni. 


“It is a ship of the Soft Shells . 
But I thought they had returned to 
their own island.” 

“This is our ship, little Vahni. The 
Soft Shell, Jackson, who is our friend, 
purchased it for us with many gems 
and much pale metal.” 

And Vahni stood in wonder re- 
garding the ship that had crossed the 
star seas from islands on another 
world. 

A t long last the waiting was ended 
The emerging young adults, no 
longer infantile finlins, but as yet 
with indifferent or erratic mental 
control, were to be given parents. 
After fifteen years, from egg to bur- 
bling youth, of living in barrack-like 
watery caverns, they were to live in 
small family units. 

To most of them this was a terrify- 
ing and sobering step. 

For the first time, Vahni saw a 
Soft Shell moving among the massed 
groups of eztaaing and chatting Peo- 
ple. How very tall and slim and frail 
he was! Gray hair grew atop his oddly 
bulging skull. She saw how tiny was 
the almost lipless mouth with its ugly, 
small, white fangs of pinkish unpro- 
tected flesh jutted between the eyes 
and the mouth, and two other round- 
ed flaps protruded at the angle of the 
jaws. 

The Soft Shell’s head and body 
were without the protective linked 
plates of horny tissue and shell of 
the People, but she had learned in 
the caverns beneath the island of Hod 
that under the flesh a filmy sort of 
shell existed. She felt a brief ugliness 
of vertigo, quick passing. 

How nasty — almost squishy! 


THE SOFT SHELLS 


85 



She saw her companions of the 
past years being named and uneasily 
being integrated into smaller, or larger 
clots of assemblage. She saw them 
moving away, off to their new homes, 
and she wondered with whom she 
would be quartered. Would they be 
kind to her or indifferent — or would 
they love her as so often she had 
dreamed would come to pass? 

“Vahnil” That was her name, and 
she saw old man Havn beckoning to 
her, while she moved clumsily toward 
the group on the central rostrum.” 
“You have a great honor, Vahni,” 
the old Turman said. “You are to 
join the household of the beloved 
Soft Shell, Jackson.” 

Almost Vahni cried out. She did 
not want to belong to this alien. Per- 
haps he would beat her or torture 
her with strange sounds and vibra- 
tions. Only in time did she remem- 
ber that she was young adult, no long- 
er finlin , and she must not appear un- 
gracious or angry. 

“I am much pleasured,” she said 
in the People’s formal and traditional 
reply, “that he has chosen me from 
among so many.” 

And now she saw the Soft Shell 
coming closer, towering high above, 
a grotesque parody of an eztaa on his 
hideous thin lips. If he touched her 
she would scream and . 

“Welcome to our household, little 
Vahni,” the Soft Shell’s harsher voice 
greeted. The tonal quality and the ac- 
cent were alien, hateful sounds. “This 
will be your older brother, Dni. Your 
older sister Thea is about some- 
where.” 

Vahni had not seen the handsome 
young Turman at the alien’s side un- 


til now. Dni’s eyes were dark flecked 
gold, and a strangely attractive little 
spar twisted his lower eztaaing lip. 
Their arms clakked formal greetings 
on their plastrons and they bowed. 

“Welcome, little sister,” Dni said. 

“Dni is learning to pilot the star 
ship,” the man, Jackson told her. 
“Already he can fly the cargo skim- 
mers and copters — he will take you 
and Thea with him some day soon.” 

Dni’s eztaa was warm and encour- 
aging, and her inner mental contact, 
briefly awakening for a moment, as- 
sured her that under his monstrous 
exterior Jackson was gentle and kind. 
To complete her growing sense of 
elation, Thea — her new buxom and 
incessantly chattering sister — gave 
her a noisy, unqualified welcome. 

Before they had traversed half the 
shady twenty blocks to the Soft 
Shell’s garden-hidden dwelling, her 
memories of Hod’s dank island cav- 
erns and the years of austere school- 
ing and discipline there were shrink- 
ing, fading dreams. 

CCTYThy does our father,” asked 
VV Vahni, a matter of twenty- 
five days later, “fear the coming of 
other Soft Shells to Turm? They 
have many good things, the flying 
ships and the machines, that we can 
use.” 

Dni eztaaed half-heartedly at Thea. 
And Thea’s ordinarily pleasant fea- 
tures sobered. 

“Our father Jackson has told us 
that to Erthmen we are but foolish 
finlins. They feel a sacred duty to 
educate us, to build great factories 
and to teach us to toil endlessly in 
their gritty, stench-polluted interiors.” 

IF 


86 



Dni nodded. “We must learn to 
worry about the future and grow old 
before our time preparing against it* 
The Soft Shells in so far as possible, 
wish to shape us into their pattern.” 
“But we told them we do not de- 
sire all of their culture,” Vahni pro- 
tested. “Surely they will not thrust 
themselves, unwanted, upon us?” 

“I fear that they will, my child.” 
The Soft Shell, Jackson, had come, 
unnoticed into the long cool room 
overlooking the color-splashed gar- 
dens. “In fact, three ships loaded 
with machinery and workers are a 
million miles offplanet, demanding 
a grounding site.” 

Dni’s golden eyes flared, and his 
lips were down-angered. 

“They would disregard our warn- 
ings?” he said. “The Allwise Council 
thought your fears ungrounded, my 
Father, but since you have for sev- 
enteen years been our trusted friend 
they assented to your message of 
stem exclusion. They considered us 
as witless finlins, as you say. But do 
not even finlins have rights that must 
not be violated?” 

The sound their father Jackson 
made was painful to Vahni’s ears. It 
was a mingling of eztaa, voiceless 
weeping and anger. 

‘To Erthmen a finlin must be pro- 
tected and disciplined,” he said. 
“Their young are like pets to be pam- 
pered and spoiled. You too will be 
petted — or paddled if necessary.” 
“But there are many empty worlds, 
my Father,” argued Dni. “Why do 
they not settle there? We will send 
them there.” 

“No, Dni. This is too logical for 
my people. They would have to 


build cities and till the soil. Here 
everything is prepared.” 

Thea, normally so happy and full 
of eztaaing nonsense, broke in. 

“We have heard you speak of 
your people who thoughtlessly litter 
the roadsides and the groves. Of their 
eggshells, ketchup bottles, paper 
cartons and tin cans. And of the 
cruel ones who abandon unwanted 
pets at roadside. And of your father, 
who yearned to retaliate in kind. 
These we thought were but stories 
to teach us consideration of others. 
We were amused. Surely no thinking 
beings acted so.” 

Jackson’s sunken little eyes were 
sad. Vahni caught a flash of the tor- 
ment within the graying Soft Shell’s 
brain. 

“It was all true, Thea. Now they 
come to litter your world.” 

“We will not permit it!” cried Dni. 

Y et, for all Dni’s brave words and 
the exchange of messages be- 
tween the Council’s spokesman. Jack- 
son, and the spaceships’ command, 
the three great ships from the seas 
of space grounded a scant mile out- 
side the city a few hours later. 

Tents and domes of bonded-earth 
warehouses sprouted like so many 
drab-colored mushrooms. Roaring 
metal titans chewed and worried at 
the reluctant soil, triumphantly bear- 
ing away crumbling sections of it to 
be deposited elsewhere. 

About the alien’s encampment a 
broad moat came into being, and 
from the underground waterways of 
Turm the Soft Shells drew water to 
set the great ditch brimming. 
Hopters circled the moated sector. 


THE SOFT SHELLS 


87 



laying down a constant spray of 
deadly fog, and hundreds of flame 
throwers sterilized and resterilized 
the encircled grounds. 

Yet the ubiquitious lilfs did not 
grow less obnoxious. Instead they 
seemed to increase. Over everything, 
the lilfs laid a crawling, itching, suck- 
ing blanket of corruption. 

And into the midst of this mad- 
dening swirl of activity and con- 
struction, the developing, highly erra- 
tic mind probes of Vahni dipped hes- 
itantly. And withdrew as she contact- 
ed the raw substance of the invad- 
ing Soft Shell’s thoughts and desires. 

How unlike they were to her Fa- 
ther Jackson, or the People of Tor- 
botha. And yet, after long terrified 
moments, she probed again. 

She searched among the harried 
brains of the Soft Shells for a mind 
not too far apart from her own. Had 
not Jackson said that there were 
many who felt as did he — that in- 
vasion and compulsion were wrong? 
And surely there would be a few ^ 
even aboard the invading ships. 

Twice she contacted briefly and 
disengaged. Then she found a gentle, 
slow-timed brain that she could com- 
prehend. As yet her command 
of Jackson’s second tongue, Un- 
tra, was poor, but through the senses 
and memory cells of this bony young 
giant, Irad Marsh, she could salvage 
scraps of sight and sounds. 

44TTTe can’t keep this up,” a 
VV filth-smeared, hairy-chested 
Soft Shell was almost screaming as 
he stood waist deep in a muddy yel- 
low flood of water. 

“Drain out all our blood! Suck us 


dry!” an unseen voice at Marsh’s el- 
bow croaked. “Look at ’em! Crusted, 
oozing filth!” 

She felt with horror the expand- 
ing, crawling, itching, rasping, never- 
silent blanket of encrusted lilfs that 
covered the vulnerable body of the 
Soft Shell, Marsh. Even when Marsh 
squatted down into the silt-heavy ca- 
nal and plunged his head beneath, 
those thousands — those millions — 
of hungry, sucking, minute mouths 
gnawed at him. 

“Out of that — back at your 
work!” Through Marsh’s eyes she saw 
the uniformed man probing at him 
with a knife-tipped weapon. 

As Marsh clumsily obeyed, follow- 
ing the back of the Soft Shell who 
had been at his elbow, Vahni could 
see that the guard was also twitching 
and wriggling involuntarily, as the 
lilfs relentlessly gnawed at his flesh. 

“ . bayonet at me!” roared the 
hairy-chested Soft Shell’s voice, and 
Marsh, turning, allowed Vahni to see 
the weapon tom from the guard’s 
hands, reversed, and then plunged 
deep into his chest. 

Marsh dropped flat. There was a 
spattering pop-pop-pop, and the burly 
Soft Shell who had killed the guard 
jolted grotesquely and obscenely into 
a shapeless mass, as dozens of tiny 
missiles fired by others struck him. 

“They’s been dozens of others,” the 
hoarse whisper of the Soft Shell who 
sprawled just ahead of Marsh inform- 
ed. Some of ’em guards and officers 
. we’ll go mad ...” 

From somewhere a booming me- 
chanical voice was issuing orders. 

“Back into the ships,” it grated out. 
“Working parties will suit up.” 


88 


IF 



B riefly, then, Vahni lost contact, 
and as briefly caught it again as 
the slow-moving Soft Shell, Marsh, 
was donning an artificial shell. For 
only a few moments could she main- 
tain the connection; yet that was 
long enough to know that the lilfs 
were not to be thwarted by metal or 
crystal or liquid. Within the ships, 
the near-microscopic parasitic filth 
that were the lilfs crusted and over- 
crusted on the sensitive flesh of the 
Soft Shells. 

Her last fading contact with Marsh 
mirrored a tortured, despairing mind 
that contemplated oblivion through 
drugs or suicide. 

Her overstrained mental probes, 
immature and erratic at best, blank- 
ed-out completely at this point, nor 
did she recover for several hours. Yet 
she could not sleep and, with her old- 
er sister Thea, she went to the city’s 
moated wall where it overlooked the 
Soft Shells’ camp. 

To her amazement, thousands of 
carapaced Turmans lined the barrier 
their golden-yellow eyes raptly in- 
tent on the ugly bonded-earth domes 
and warehouses out there. They did 
not speak together, and their gaze 
did not waver. 

“Why do our people do this?” she 
asked Thea. 

“We make them feel the lilfs,” 
Thea said quietly. “The Soft Shells 
are like newly born finlins. They can- 
not communicate or control objects 
with their minds. Unlike us they can- 
not send away the few lilfs who 
somehow pass the watery barriers, and 
the walls.” 

Vahni held her breath for a long 
moment and then released it. 


“Within the city,” she said, “we 
shield ourselves and Jackson. But 
what of the false shells and the sealed 
star ships?” 

“We enter their minds, Vahni. AH 
of these thousands and all the Tur- 
mans in our other cities. One lilf, or 
no lilfs, can become a score, a hun- 
dred, a thousand — millions! They 
squirm. They crawl. They wallow in 
tissue and blood! Always they move 
and feed.” 

And suddenly Vahni sensed some- 
thing of that outward message. Her 
own shells were a-crawl with the mi- 
nute irritants of a myriad loathsome 
feeding parasites, ever-expanding and 
clawing deeper, deeper! 

Resolutely she tried to blank her 
mind against that message. 

D oggedly the Soft Shells fought on. 

They threw up new barriers of 
chemically-impregnated soil. They 
scorched and fused the already life- 
less earth about them. They deluged 
themselves and the ships with count- 
less tons of water. 

All was useless. Even within the 
hitherto impregnable ships, twitching, 
sweating Soft Shells fought and claw- 
ed and moaned. The solidity of bulk- 
heads and lockers and bunks writhed 
and crawled with a slippery living 
moss of lilfs; or so it seemed to them. 

Through Thea’s descriptions of 
what her own mind contacted, Vahni 
learned this, at first; and later she 
too was recovered enough to catch 
brief, distorted glimpses of what the 
Soft Shells endured. 

“Why do they not leave, my Fa- 
ther?” Vahni asked the tall Erthman. 
Jackson was pale and trembling,

his eyes shot through with yellow- 
ness, and the veins outlined in sickly 
red. Like his own people without the 
walls, though to a lesser degree, he 
was under assault by the power of 
thousands of Torbothan minds. 

“We are a stubborn race, Vahni.” 
Jackson’s travesty of an eztaa was 
feeble — barely a grimace of the 
narrow lips. “Yet even we can en- 
dure only so much. The ships will be 
leaving soon, my child. Let us hope 
that Turm will be classified as unfit 
for colonization. It should be, after 
this fiasco.” 

And toward nightfall of the second 
day, Vahni knew that Jackson was 
right The huge ditching and building 
machines were piloted aboard ship. 
The domes and warehouses were 
blown up. 

With early dusk, the ships lifted as 
one on ravening, mighty legs of hell- 
ish flame. Higher they rose and swift- 
ly dwindled into fading freckles on 
the pale disc of Turm’s early rising 
inner moon. 

That night there was eztaaing and 
clakking and dancing in the city and 
in all the cities roundabout, but soon 
the great weariness of their long vigil 
came and drove them home. 

Only in the great, low dwelling 
where Vahni lay sleeping was there 
light and activity. The Soft Shell, 
Jackson, and his son, Dni, kept the 
ears of their radio receivers trained 
on the receding tiny fleet and on the 
nearest Erth-dominated planetary 
system of Pyar.

might hinge on what they learned 
in the next few hours — or days.

Guaranteed cut from the still 
quivering body of a native . 


Illustrated by BODS 


J udson Kruger, festooned with 
cameras to make him look like 
another tourist, thought that Orsu, 
the native proprietor of the only 
Terran-type inn on the planet Mar- 
rech, was a slippery character any 
way you looked at him. Resembling 
a pale, hairless, iridescent giant ot- 
ter, with three pairs of short limbs 
to support his flabby bulk, Orsu kept 
throwing furtive glances over what 
would have been his shoulder if he’d 


had any to speak of. His slanted, slit- 
ted eyes reinforced the impression. 
He’d learned English, but spoke it in 
a squeaky whisper. 

Just now Orsu was showing one of 
the illicit and enormously-prized pelts 
to Kruger and to a pair of very rich 
tourists. The eyes of the couple held 
the glitter of people about to acquire 
at a bargain something their neigh- 
bors can’t afford. 

Mrs. Rocklyn poked a pudgy fin- 


91 



ger. eagerly into a half-inch hole in 
the pelt. “Is this where the bullet 
went in?” 

“That was first bullet,” Orsu 
squeaked. “This was famous chief, 
very strong.” He turned the hide over 
and displayed two more holes. “He 
run six miles, bleeding.” 

“Awful!” Mrs. Rocklyn gasped 
happily. 

Her husband’s eyes glittered hard- 
er. “How much you want for this 
one?” 

Orsu glanced behind him nervous- 
ly. “I not can sell. I must take you 
to Terran who has skins, can sell.” 

Kruger’s pulse quickened. That 
would be the man he was after — 
Sears, the renegade responsible for 
this foul traffic; though Kruger didn’t 
know who was more reprehensible, 
the renegade or the natives, like Orsu, 
who helped the outlaw murder in- 
offensive members of their own spe- 
cies. 

T o meet Hank Sears they had to 
walk through rain to a poorer 
part of town. Kruger couldn’t read 
the faces of the natives they met, 
but Orsu wore an Earth-made revolv- 
er in plain sight. 

Sears was a lanky, bearded man of 
perhaps fifty. He wore an enormous 
pistol on one hip, and an ugly hunt- 
ing-knife on the other. A heavy rifle 
leaned in one corner of the dingy 
room. 

Sears started by showing Rocklyn 
the smallest of six or seven pelts he 
had with him. “This one’s from a 
half-grown female. I crippled her at 
two hundred yards, a lucky shot, and 
one of my natives finished her off 


with a knife.” He fingered a gash 
near one end of the skin. ‘This can 
be trimmed off, or you can leave it 
and have a pocket sewed inside. It 
won’t tear any farther; see?” He tug- 
ged at it hard, but it held. “There’s 
plenty of stuff here for a man’s 
jacket.” 

The leather was undeniably splen- 
did. It was an eighth of an inch thick, 
waterproof, cellular so that it would 
insulate well against cold, and dis- 
played a satiny sheen on either side. 
Sears glanced at Mrs. Rocklyn’s hips, 
and reached for the largest of the 
pelts. “This’ll make you a full-length 
coat, Madame. See how soft and pli- 
ant it is, yet tough!” 

Mrs. Rocklyn reached greedily for 
the pelt, examined it, began to breathe 
hard, and asked in a trembling voice, 
“What’s this burned place?” 

Sears glanced at it. “That? Oh, we 
wounded the fellow, and he took to 
the brush, and we had to burn him 
out. Devil of a job getting a fire start- 
ed here; you have to use a flame- 
thrower. He still put up a fight, even 
with his lowest pair of legs burned 
off. They’re dangerous with knives, if 
you let them get in close. Finished 
him myself with a club; that’s why 
the head’s missing.” 

“Awful!” Mrs. Rocklyn choked, 
drooling. 

Orsu put in quickly, “They wild 
people. Not belong this town.” 

Sears said casually, “Hardly more 
than animals.” 

Kruger, watching him, saw that 
some of the casualness was feigned. 
Sears was doubtless anxious about the 
sale. But the Rocklyns were too eager 
to notice.

IF 



T he tourist ship left two days later, 
taking the Rocklyns and the two 
pelts, for which they’d paid an 
amount several times Kruger’s annual 
salary. Of course, if they’d tried to 
buy them within ten thousand light- 
years of Earth, they’d have paid much 
more. 

It might be several months before 
another tourist ship came, but Kruger 
thought he had an adequate pretense 
for staying over. Marrech had hardly 
been photographed at all, up to now. 
He wasn’t supposed to arrest Sears 
single-handed; only to get the evi- 
dence and summon a Terran Space 
Force vessel that lurked within call. 

He spent the first two weeks bon- 
ing up on the native language and 
collecting what information he could. 
Orsu kept a close watch on him at 
first. Sears had presumably gone up- 
river where, fifty miles inland, he had 
a home and a wife, to wait word 
from Orsu when more customers ar- 
rived. 

Marrech, Kruger learned, was a 
wet world, even now at the sunniest 
season. Jungles of rubbery-leaved 
trees ran right down to the surf and 
seemed to swathe most of the hills 
on both sides of the river. The river, 
a wide, swift, muddy stream, poured 
foamily from the interior, bringing 
now and then clumps of broken-off 
foliage or whole uprooted trees. 

The main articles of commerce 
(aside from lumber, which was in 
considerable demand by off-world 
buyers because it was quite resistant 
to immersion in water) seemed to be 
spices from the interior. Natives, 
swimming down-river or scuttling 
along jungle trails, brought the spices, 


packed in leather bundles strapped to 
their backs. Entrepreneurs in town 
stored the spices in crude lumber 
warehouses until alien ships arrived 
to bargain. 

The natives who brought the spices 
were wild ones, judging by their scant 
clothing and their crude spears and 
bows. They showed no fear of most 
of the townspeople, nor of most of 
the visitors from space. Of Orsu, 
though, they seemed frantically afraid 
— whenever Kruger saw one of them 
catch sight of the inn-keeper, the na- 
tive would begin to tremble, utter 
little shrieks of terror, and scuttle out 
of sight as fast as possible. 

They seemed quite wary of Kruger, 
too, avoiding him nervously. Possibly 
they recognized him as of^the same 
species as Sears, who hunted their 
kind so ruthlessly inland.' Or they 
might think the cameras Kruger car- 
ried were some sort of horrendous, 
off-world weapons. On occasion, they 
displayed toward him a strange kind 
of behavior — perhaps it was a rit- 
ual, or perhaps it was a sign of emo- 
tion. They seemed strangely furtive 
about it. He’d see them watching him 
from a doorway, or from down the 
street. They’d be rapidly opening and 
closing their mouths, clashing their 
not-inconsiderable teeth together so 
fast it sounded like a typewriter. 
Sometimes they’d be shivering as if 
in fury. 

Only occasionally did he observe 
this behavior when they weren’t look- 
ing at him. Natives, townsmen as well 
as wild tribesmen, would be facing 
one another, clashing their teeth and 
undulating their bodies. Maybe, he 
thought, they were having arguments.

After two weeks he felt he’d learn- 
ed enough. There were, apparently, 
no local fauna an armed man need 
fear if he were watchful. He decided 
to start inland, alone and on foot. 
Accordingly he seized an opportunity 
when the watchful Orsu — who had 
been acting uneasy and irritable for a 
few days — left town. 

I 

K ruger slipped into the jungle. He 
mustn’t, he felt, stay too close 
to the river; there was too much 
travel on it or alongside it. Before 
he’d gone a mile he realized he’d 
made a mistake; he should have gone 
along the coast to the high, nearly 
tiafe ridge east of town and headed 
inland along that The mud in the 
jungle wasn’t deep, but it was gluey, 
bhUdihg ixp into great globs on his 
bocki,' Which weren’t small to begin 
with, so that he grunted with effort 
every step, trying to lift the weight 
clear of the ground. Repeatedly he 
slipped and went sprawling with a 
laud splat. At such times he would 
lie there for a few minutes, making 
terse comments about Marrech, about 
his Terran boss who’d sent him on 
this mission, and about himself for 
being foot enough to be an interstellar 
plaindothesman in the first place. 

Finally he learned to seek out the 
runnels of liquid mud. It was no more 
slippery, if he stepped carefully, and 
it didn’t build up on his boots. Still, 
he had to stop every little way and 
fiiid a stick to scrape it off before it 
began to dry. The boots got soaked 
through* and the rest of his clothes 
were covered with the dark-brown 
goo. 

No wonder the natives here had 


evolved such waterproof skins! And 
no wonder they kept to the trails 
along the river, where they could 
swim periodically and wash them- 
selves off! 

He stopped about midday, munch- 
ed on a can of C-rations, and stared 
eastward, muttering to himself. Was 
it worthwhile to climb to the ridge 
now? Hardly — the slope was steep 
enough and slippery enough so that 
it might actually be impossible. He 
could go back to the coast and start 
over, but that was against his nature, 
and he’d already expended half a 
day. He’d keep on. Maybe, when he 
was far enough from town, he could 
go to the river. 

But by mid-afternoon his gradual 
climb inland had brought him to a 
region where the soil was less muddy 
and more loamy. Now he began to 
see signs of animal life. There were 
tracks everywhere. Some of the larger 
animals seemed to have feet very 
much like those of the natives. Here 
and there, the trunks of trees — rub- 
bery as they were — showed abra- 
sions as if animals rubbed against 
them. But the only living things he 
met were some small six-legged things 
no bigger than rats, and a few batlike 
flyers that chittered at him cantan- 
kerously. 

Presently he found more ominous 
signs. Here and there were scraps of 
skin, as if predators had been at 
work. There was no blood, but of 
course the nightly rains would have 
washed that away. He saw no bones. 
Once, though, he did hear, out of 
sight in the thick jungle, crunching 
and rasping sounds of large teeth. He 
grew more watchful.

IF 



T oward night it began to rain — a 
drizzle at first, then a downpour 
that drummed on the big leaves high 
over his head and gathered into cas- 
cades to run down the tree trunks or 
to fall with loud splatterings on the 
already wet ground. He dodged the 
driblets as best he could for a while, 
then gave up. It was almost dusk any- 
way — he’d better find a good tree 
and climb it for the night. 

He chose a large tree that had a 
limb low enough for him to reach; 
jumped, caught a handhold, hung 
grunting for a minute, then hauled 
himself up. The tree had somewhat 
the configuration of a very large Ter- 
ran magnolia — except that the leaves 
were two feet across. They were very 
rubbery, like the bark. He sweated 
and swore, shinnying up the slick 
trunk between limbs, but finally at- 
tained a notch fifty feet above ground 
where he could relax without much 
fear of falling. Comfort he’d have to 
forgo. 

t Night came like a black tent. If 
either of Marrech’s two moons was 
up, the clouds hid it. He’d chosen a 
spot where no water fell directly on 
him, but it splashed from all sides 
steadily. His clothes — supposed to 
be more or less waterproof — might 
have been plain untreated cotton, for 
all the good they did. He was cold 
and hungry — but not hungry enough 
to open any more C-rations — and 
stiff and cramped. If only, he thought 
plaintively, he had a skin like the na- 
tives — or even, he thought suddenly 
with a disgusted grunt, if he’d had the 
sense to bring a bottle of Terran 
whiskey or hundred-proof Moogan 
rum! 


He grew very drowsy. But of 
course he daren’t fall asleep. The 
night dragged oh. At times there were 
sounds from below, feet or hooves 
splatting in the mushy loam. Near 
midnight a group of animals seemed 
to hold a conference below his tree, 
grunting and chattering. 

Suddenly the tree began to shake. 
Anxiously he fumbled beneath his 
soaked poncho for a needlegun and 
peered downward, twisting as best he 
could to see between the leaves. Were 
there glimpses of vague forms in the 
darkness? Were they climbing up the 
tree after him? He clung there, trying 
not to breathe audibly. 

After a while, though, he realized 
they weren’t climbing. They seemed 
merely to be rubbing,, then^selves 
against the trunk. He cursed; silently 
at his incaution. He should have 
made sure he chose a jtree without 
the abrasions! 

The activity went on most of the 
rest of the night, with animals leaving 
and being replaced by others, as near- 
ly as he could judge by the sounds. 
Finally he grew more or less recon- 
ciled. The tree’s recurrent quivering 
did his nerves no good, but at least 
that and the noises helped keep him 
awake. He began to think he might 
survive until dawn. Although, he 
thought darkly, he couldn’t imagine 
why any sane man, would want to 
be here. 

D awn was foggy and wet, but at 
least the rain had stopped, and 
the animals had gone away. He forc- 
ed down some more C-rations, groan- 
ingly unbent his cramped arms and 
legs, and made his way, slipping and 


THE HIDES OF MARRECH

shivering and cursing, down the tree. 
He hobbled on inland. 

After a couple of hours, the sun 
broke through. Should he turn toward 
the river now? Surely he was far 
enough from town so there’d be little 
traffic. So far as wild natives were 
concerned, he had only mild appre- 
hensions. He knew enough of the 
language to make it clear to them 
that he was their ally against Sears 
and Orsu. 

He turned toward the river. 

After a while he heard the rapids. 
A few minutes more and he came to 
a wide, clear, sandy path. For a min- 
ute he just stood and stared, over- 
come by such comparative luxury. 
The sun was warm by now, and he 
considered whether he might bathe 
and wash thf mud out of his clothes 
and take time to let them dry. Too 
risky, he decided, in the river itself. 
Better wait until he found some small 
tributary. He knew there were at least 
two before he’d reach Sears’ place; 
as nearly as he could guess, it must 
be not less than ten miles farther up- 
stream. 

Probably it was the warmth of the 
sun and the ease of the trail that 
made him careless. In any case, he 
rounded a turn and suddenly found 
himself facing eight or ten wild na- 
tives. 

They wore no backpacks, which 
meant they weren’t gathering or trans- 
porting spice. They had arrow- 
quivers, hung from neckstraps, dan- 
gling upon their narrow chests. The 
bows were no more than two feet 
long, but sturdy. Each native carried 
in one paw a slender five-foot spear 
tipped with sharpened bone, ready to 


thrust. Kruger let his hand creep to- 
ward his gun, which wasn’t too ac- 
cessible under his poncho. 

But apparently the natives were 
ready for him. A burst of chittermg 
and growling came from the trees a 
few yards away. Startled, he jerked 
his head around to stare. He could 
see a few drawn bows among the 
foliage, but for all he knew there 
might be a hundred aimed at him. 
Slowly he let his hand drop. His first 
words came out in a feeble squawk. 
“I — friend.” In this situation, he 
found it very hard to remember any 
of the native words. “I go to — to 
stop Earthman who hunts your peo- 
ple for their skins!” 

They stood impassive. 

“I want to walk through your 
country,” he said, aware that he was 
sweating profusively. “I will not 
bother you, and I carry my own 
food.” 

F or a moment the band in front of 
him stared at him silently. Then 
one started to clash his teeth rapidly. 
The rest took it up, and soon they 
were all chattering and writhing. He 
quailed before the show of teeth. “I 
friend! I friend!” 

When the unseen pair came from 
behind to seize him, he struggled 
frantically, but all they wanted was 
to keep his hands away from his 
weapons while the rest swarmed over 
him. Within seconds, they had him 
pinned down. Then they lifted him, 
still struggling futilely, and carried 
him toward the river. 

“Hey!” he choked, “Let me go! I 
friend!” 

They tossed him out as far as they

could. He hit the water with a jarring 
splash and went under. When he 
managed to surface again, sputtering 
and coughing, they were lined up on 
the bank, teeth chattering. One of 
them squeaked, “Have a bath, muddy 
friend!” Another, who seemed to be 
the leader, gestured meaningfully with 
his spear. “Foreign fool, stay in town! 
We do not want you here!” 

Kruger was treading water franti- 
cally to keep his head above the sur- 
face. He tried once more, plaintively, 
“I friend,” but it only brought on 
more tooth-gnashings. Several of the 
natives reached thoughtfully for ar- 
rows. Kruger took the hint and began 
to, swim down river as fast as he 
could. They followed him for always 
to make sure he kept going; but 
where the current ran fast, tumbling 
him> along, they seemed to tire of the 
pursuit and stopped. He could hear 
them chittering for a moment, then 
he was out of earshot 
The rapids gave him a battering, 
and he clawed his way ashore as soon 
as he could — on the opposite bank. 
He dragged himself out of sight and 
lay panting for a while, too exhausted 
even to curse. 

Finally he hauled himself to a sit- 
ting position. “Damned stupid un- 
printable natives! I ought to go back 
to town and let them . .” But, an- 
grily, he got to his feet and glared 
upriver. No bunch of spear-carrying, 
naked, six-legged, overgrown otters 
was going to stop him! 

H e went back up the off-side of 
the river, where there was no 
trail, needlegun clutched in his Hand 
this time, pausing every little way to 


listen and to look for tracks. Appar- 
ently there were not large animals 
abroad here either, in daylight — tree- 
trunks were abraded here and there, 
but by now he was convinced that 
activity was nocturnal. 

He made fairly good time; the soil 
was loamy and didn’t stick to his 
boots. Noon came and went. Not long 
after that, he began to hear horns — 
weird mournful notes that he presum- 
ed must be this world’s equivalent of 
hunting-horns. 

He went on cautiously enough. 
What undid him, about mid-after- 
noon, was something he least expect- 
ed — he began to hear baying, back 
in the direction from which he’d 
come. He crouched, staring that way. 
He’d be damned if those didn’t sound 
like dogs! 

Well, dogs or some Marrech equiv- 
alent, they were certainly on his 
trail. He looked around anxiously. 
There was supposed to be one creek 
branching off this side of the river, 
just below Sears’ ranch, and he must 
be near it now. If he could reach it 
in time . 

It wasn’t more than a quarter-mile, 
but by the time he found the small 
stream the baying was close behind. 
Hastily, he waded upstream. Wouldn’t 
fool diem long, of course, if they 
were good tracking animals, but there 
was no time to construct any compli- 
cated trail-puzzles. He kept an eye 
out for any tree-limbs he might reach 
from the water. There! No — that 
tree wasn’t big enough; didn’t have 
enough foliage. There, then! He hur- 
ried to a more likely branch; he seized 
it, shinnyed along the limb to the 
trunk and struggled up it. By now he 


98 


IF 



could hear the animals clamoring 
around the point where he’d entered 
the stream. But he was hidden in 
foliage; with luck, he’d be safe for a 
while. 

The hunt was coming upstream 
now. The beasts, whatever they were, 
had crossed and were undoubtedly 
sniffing up the far bank for an emerg- 
ing trail. He grunted in satisfaction. 
The tree he’d chosen was on the 
downriver side of the creek. Maybe, 
if they went on past, he could . 

Then he heard a human voice. 

Snarling, he reached again for his 
pistol. Sears would be able to guess 
which tree a man would choose. 

There was an interplay of hunting- 
horns, and some yipping from the 
beasts, then he heard the latter move 
on more slowly up the opposite bank. 
Finally he caught a glimpse of them, 
and growled under his breath. 

There were three Terran blood- 
hounds and an Airedale. 

M inutes later he heard Sears call 
to him, “Kruger! Kruger! Come 
on down. We’re not hostile!” 

Kruger snarled to himself. No, you 
murdering bastard! But l am — to- 
ward you ! 

“Kruger, don’t be foolish. You’re 
perched in a tree somewhere, and I 
know you don’t have much food with 
you. You’ll starve or die of pneu- 
monia eventually. Come on down! 
You can photograph anything you 
want, if that’3 what’s on your mind. 
I have no reason to stop you.” 
Kruger glared toward the unseen 
man. Was it possible to maintain the 
tourist pose? At the worst, Sears 
might haul him back to town — not 


letting him get near the ranch. And 
the outlaw was right; with dogs roam- 
ing the country he couldn’t very well 
carry out his planned snooping. 

Better, maybe to gamble on Sears’ 
gullibility. In any case, there was the 
Terran space-cruiser out there.” 
“Sears! This is Kruger. I’ll come 
down if you’ll call in your dogs!” 
“Okay, Kruger.” The horns sound- 
ed several short notes. The dogs yip- 
ped and seemed to be gathering to- 
ward Sears. 

Kruger slid down from his perch, 
walked downstream and waded 
across. By then Sears and six or eight 
natives were waiting. Kruger scowled 
at the natives. As far as he could tell, 
they were no different from the ones 
who’d thrown him into the river. 

Sears was grinning at him. The 
lanky renegade carried a rifle, but it 
was held laxly, pointing downward. 
“I figure you’re some kind of a cop, 
Kruger. Am I right? If so, we can 
both relax. I’ve got nothing to fear 
from you, nor yon from me.” 
Kruger snarled and stood where he 
was. So the masquerade was futile. 
“Don’t be too sure! There’s a Ba- 
zooka-class TSF cruiser a few hun- 
dred thousand miles off-planet, wait- 
ing for my call. If I don’t call within 
a certain time, they’ll come down, 
and they already know enough to find 
you. They’ll turn the planet inside out 
if they have to!” 

Sears grinned more deeply, though 
some of the natives made die tooth- 
gnashing sound. “Come on back to 
my place, Kruger. You can use S 
change of clothes and a hot meal. I 
don’t think I have to worry about 
that cruiser.” 


THE HIDES OF MARRECH

T he dogs, once introduced, were 
friendly. So was Sears* wife — 
a small blonde woman, perhaps ten 
years younger than her husband. She 
said she*d hurry up the evening meal. 

Sears was acting far too amiable to 
suit Kruger. “You may as well leave 
your cameras in the house, since 
they're only a disguise. There's some- 
thing I want you to see first of all.** 
“Yeah?" Kruger was determined to 
play it cool. He divesfed himself of 
the cameras, light-meters and other 
paraphernalia, then followed Sears 
toward a large shed that had electric 
wires strung to it. Evidently Sears had 
ft generator in the house. There were 
Other signs of luxury, too. Not sur- 
prising, with the amount of money he 
made off the illicit pelts! 

The shed was well lighted inside. 
Kruger stepped in after Sears, then 
halted in surprise. 

Orsu lay on a couch to one side of 
the shed. He blinked at Kruger. “Oh, 
he here finally? Good! I getting tired 
of wait!** 

Another native — almost nude, like 
the wild ones — walked toward Orsu 
with a big ugly hunting-knife. 

Orsu turned belly-up and spread 
his limbs to the sides. 

With an involuntary cry, Kruger 
stepped forward. Sears grabbed him 
by the shoulder. “Relax! Nobody’s 
going to hurt him!’* 

Astounded, Kruger watched the 
other native guide the knife expertly 
from Orsu’s chin, down across his 
belly, then out along each of the 
limbs. The skin split and popped 
open, disclosing the sheen of a com- 
pletely new layer underneath. Orsu 
wriggled, giving little grunts and sighs 


of comfort. The knife-wielding native 
helped him peel off the old skin until 
it was only attached at the head and 
along the spine. “Must wait now, 
other hour, two hour,** Orsu squeak- 
ed. “Not loose yet, everywhere.** 

Dumbly, Kruger looked at Sears. 
The lanky man grinned. “It’s a lot 
more comfortable for them this way 
than having to rub the old skin off 
against a tree trunk. Come on back 
to the house. My wife’ll have drinks 
ready.*’ 

Two hours later, Kruger, Sears and 
his wife, Orsu, and five wild natives 
sat down to a sumptuous dinner. Orsu 
was feeling especially jovial. “Maybe 
cop Kruger like jacket made from 
my skin. It best skin I ever shed since 
pup.** He chattered his teeth in what 
Kruger now recognized as laughter. 
“He need bribe to keep mouth shut, 
eh?** 

“Uh,” Kruger protested weakly. 

Sears said, “You’ll be here a while 
anyway waiting for the next tourist 
ship, unless you intend to go home 
on that cruiser.” 

“Uh, no. There’s no sense in call- 
ing it down now. And I do have a 
pose to maintain.” 

“Fine. It’ll take a couple of weeks 
to tan the skin properly, then a few 
days for my wife to make you up a 
jacket. We can put a few bullet-holes 
or something in it, if you like. Mean- 
while, I hope you’ll be our guest. We 
don’t see many Terrans out here. Not 
the kind we’d want for guests, any- 
way.** 

T he next tourist ship carried two 
couples who bought pelts. It was 
with one of those couples that Kruger

sat over cocktails in the ship’s lounge, 
just after take-off. 

The woman was a rangey type with 
nostrils that flared like a mare’s. She 
fingered Kruger’s jacket enviously. “I 
do believe this is an even better pelt 
than the ones we bought!” 

“Special process,” Kruger mum- 
bled secretively. 

Her nostrils widened. “Tell us 
about it!” 

“No — please. I don’t like to talk 
about it. It’s pretty brutal.” 

The husband’s eyes glittered. 
“Waitress! Let’s have refills all 
around, here!” He gave Kruger a 
minute to gulp his new drink. “You 
were saying, Kruger, about a special 
process?” 


Kruger pretended to yield. He 
looked around furtively, then leaned 
forward and spoke in a hoarse whis- 
per. “Well, it involves beating; the 
hide while the native’s still in it, to 
work the natural oils into it. You 
have to know just how much, you 
can beat him — over every inch of 
his body, you know — without kill- 
ing him — or her. Then you have to 
stop for a while and let Mm revive. 
As often as not, heTl die before the 
job’s finished.” He ran a h&M} lov- 
ingly over his jacket. •‘This w|s a 
perfect job. No stains.” He went on 
to explain, “if you beat them just a 
little too hard they bleed wrong, and 
it’s hell trying to wash the Mood 
out of the pelt.” END

He had saved her We, the only 
way he could — without, that is, 
giving up on his own desires! 


T_Je bent to touch her, his dry, 
A A flaked hand a rasp across the 
smoothness of her cheek. In her sleep 
she winced and hugged herself against 
the deepening chill. I’ll wake her with 
a kiss, he thought. But he didn’t. In- 
stead he again reached out, hesitated, 
then brushed her shoulder. He shook 
her. “It’s me, Paula,” he said. 

In her long, drugged sleep the 
girl’s lashes had stuck together, and 
she ground pale hands into her eyes 
to clear them. Now fully awake, she 
stared at him without recognition. 
Had he changed so much over the 
years? His hand began to tremble and 
he removed it from her shoulder. 
Paula’s eyes grew wider, then shifted 
to take in her surroundings. The cave 
was dark except for the light of a 
wood fire at the entrance, shudder- 
ing their shadows across the cracked 
walls. She sat up jerkily. “What place 
is this? Who are you?” 

He smiled reassuringly, the smile 
he knew she loved. In the shifting 
light she stared hard at him, be- 
wildered. She wore a white night- 
gown, her long black hair bound up 
with pins that had begun to loosen, 
stray wisps of hair trailing to her 
shoulders. “George?” she ventured 
finally. His smile widened, and he 
nodded. She still knew him, would 
still love him. Until this moment he 
hadn’t acknowledged his own secret 
dread. 

“But you’re — you’re old!” she 
wailed. 

“Don’t be afraid,” he told her. 
“There’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s 
really me, and I’m not so old. I’m 
not sixty yet.” 

Shivering, she glanced around the 


102 



cave. “Where are we? The last I re- 
member, I’d gone to bed . ” She 
couldn’t keep her eyes from his face. 
“George, what’s happened to you?” 

“Nothing but age,” he said. “It’s 
the fate of everyone, even yours, now 
that I’ve saved you from it.” He rose 
shakily, his limbs aching from the 
hours he crouched over the still 
form. “As for this place, it’s a cave 
by a river.” He moved stiffly toward 
the rear of the cave, occasionally 
reaching out to touch one of the 
boxes stacked neatly along the walls. 
“There are few if any dangerous ani- 
mals in this era, and I’ve stored 
enough food and clothing and agri- 
cultural supplies to keep us for the 
rest of our natural lives.” He turned 
back to her, his love still mute with- 
in him. He could never express him- 
self as he wished. “The rest of our 
natural lives,” he repeated. 

For the first time Paula seemed to 
realize that she was in her nightgown. 
“I’m cold,” she said, and clutched it 
tightly about her. He smiled again, 
went to one of the boxes and drew 
out a long blue dress with a high 
neck and puffed sleeves, the latest 
style at the time he’d bought it. 
“Here’s part of your wardrobe. I’ve 
got everything you need, the finest 
material I could find.” 

She took her dress, held it against 
her body, running her fingers over 
the unfamiliar cloth. “I was in bed, 
asleep,” she said. 

“Yes, you were asleep. I came to 
your house and broke in. I gave you 
an injection to keep you sleeping, not 
with a needle but a — a new kind 
that sprays on your skin. Then I 
brought you here.” 


“But you weren't even in town! 
You were way across the country!” 

O n December 8, 1939, he had 
been way across the country, at 
Harvard, dreaming of the Christmas 
holidays and seeing her again. But he 
hadn’t seen her, not for another forty 
years, not until a few hours ago. And 
not until a year before had he been 
sure that he would ever see her. 

The girl seemed reluctant to put on 
the dress perhaps because of the 
odd style, perhaps because she didn’t 
want to disrobe in front of him. Sup- 
pressing his annoyance he brought out 
a heavy pink dressing gown and a pair 
of pink furry slippers he’d selected 
from a department store in San Fran- 
cisco. “It’s a long story and a compli- 
cated one,” he said as she slipped 
them on. “What you’ve got to un- 
derstand is that, strange as all this may 
seem to you, it’s absolutely necessary 
to save your life.” 

She was still staring at him, her 
head twitching in brief, involuntary 
denials. 

“On December 8, 1939, Paula. .. 
you died. You were in bed asleep 
when a drunken driver turned your 
corner, lost control of his car, and 
plowed through the wall erf your bed- 
room. The gas tank exploded and you 
were . you were burned to death.” 
He flinched as a vision of the fiery 
wreck flamed across his conscious- 
ness, as vivid as if he had witnessed 
it himself. “But you’re not dead now, 
Paula; because, you see, I came back 
to rescue you.” 

She stood silent, hugging the robe 
about her. He brushed his hands to- 
gether with a harsh, rustling sound 


IN THE OLIGOCENE 


103 



like the scrape of dead leaves. ”1 
was studying at Harvard, you know. I 
dropped out for a year, too broken 
up to do any work. But eventually I 
went back, changed my major to 
physics, got my doctorate. I didn't 
forget you.” 

The earth trembled as in the dis- 
tance some great animal passed by. 

“I didn't marry,” George said. 
‘There was no one I could have 
loved as I loved you. I carried your 
picture with me always, one I stole 
from your parents' home after the 
funeral. The others — other people 
— they thought I was some kind of 
eccentric. But they hadn't loyed you 
as I had. I kept myself going with 
the memory of you, that memory and 
my work. I was working on a re- 
search grant, developing some ideas 
for a unified field theory. I came to 
see . well, it’s pretty complicated, 
but you could say that the passage 
of time generates energy and that 
you can utilize the energy accumu- 
lated between the present and any 
point in the past or future to project 
yourself to that point. Harnessing the 
energy was a technical problem I 
couldn't solve myself, but with the 
help of others it was possible to con- 
struct something I guess you’d have 
to call a time machine. Can you see 
that when I did all this I was think- 
ing only of you?” 

Paula said nothing, listening grave- 
ly to the words of the thin, gray man 
who seemed but distantly related to 
the boy she had known yesterday. 

“The machine was completed,” he * 
went on, “in 1978. We found that 
it could carry a man into either past 
or future and return him to the point 


in time from which he'd departed. 
Soon we were able to calibrate the 
machine to within a few days’ accu- 
racy. With that accomplished 1 could 
begin to plan and hope. 

“1 located this place, found the 
cave, and began to stock it with ev- 
erything we’d need to survive here. 
I had to do it quietly, secretly, at 
night when everyone else had left. 
No one was to suspect the real rea- 
son for my work on the project. Had 
they known what I planned they’d 
surely have stopped me, because it 
meant losing the only machine that 
had been produced — a very ex- 
pensive instrument.” 

S he caught her breath and retreated 
a few steps until she was stopped 
by the wall of the cave. “George, 
where are we?” 

“It’s sometime in the Oligocene 
period, a comparatively gentle era 
in the earth’s history. The great rep- 
tiles are gone, and the largest mam- 
mals aren’t numerous enough to be 
dangerous. It’s long before the first 
ice age yet. We’ll be in no real danger 
here.” 

“My God! You mean there are no 
other people?” 

“Yes, it’s a paradise just for the 
two of us. With no one to threaten 
us here we can be really happy.” He 
paused as if expecting her deferred 
applause. 

She came forward hesitantly, 
searching his eyes for the familiar 
personality beneath the stranger’s age- 
ing mask. “But wasn't there some 
other way? Couldn’t you have saved 
me and left me in ... in my o\yn 
time?” 


104 


IF 



Pressing his thin lips together he 
shook his head with visible annoy- 
ance. “Don’t you think I considered 
all the possibilities? Of course I 
could simply have awakened you and 
got you out of the house before the 
car crashed. But what good would 
that have done me? You’d only have 
been saved for young George at Har- 
vard. Or someone else. I’d have saved 
you and gained nothing for myself! 

“Oh, I even thought of taking you 
back into my own time, but I wasn’t 
sure it was possible. We didn’t know 
anything about the effects of possible 
paradoxes yet. Could you actually 
exist in a future time stream where 
you’d died years before? I didn’t 
know, and I couldn’t experiment to 
find out. Above all I couldn’t take 
the chance of losing you again. The 
safest thing to do was take you into 
the past. That’s why we’re here.” 

For the first time he realized that 
the girl was trembling. He came for- 
ward and took her hand, noting the 
slight involuntary tug as she pulled 
away. He gripped her more tightly. 
“I know this a lot to assimilate all at 
once. It must be terrifying to find 
yourself in a strange world, even 
with someone you love. But you’ve 
got to see that it was the only way. 
By taking you away on the very 
night you should have been killed I 
disturbed the fabric of time only 
slightly. Of course we might have 
gone back to some civilized period, 
but why risk any more accidents? 
Civilization means war, famine, 
plague, riot. ... Do you think I’d 
risk losing you again? No place is 
entirely safe, but this is the safest I 
could think of.” 


Her trembling had increased until 
she shook uncontrollably. “George, 
we can’t live in this world all alone, 
no matter how many supplies you’ve 
got stored here. There have to be oth- 
er people! I don’t want to be alone!” 

He covered his soft hand with his 
own. “Why do we need anyone else 
when we have each other?” A sullen 
shadow passed over his face. “What 
have other people ever meant to us 
but bitterness and separation? When 
have other people encouraged our 
love? They just cause trouble; they al- 
ways have. Your mother. ...” 

“George,” she broke in, “what 
about sickness? You say it’s safe here, 
but there aren’t any doctors. You 
wouldn’t want me to die of some 
disease!” 

He smiled easily, as if he had long 
anticipated just this objection. “As a 
matter of fact I’ve studied medicine 
rather closely and feel I’m as qualified 
to practice as any doctor. I’ve got all 
sorts of medical equipment stored 
here and I know how to use it. There 
are even several cases of drugs and 
antibiotics. I’m prepared to do any- 
thing from cleaning teeth to — ” he 
paused, giggled unexpectedly — “de- 
livering a baby.” 

Paula lowered her eyes, her face 
distorted as if in pain. “But, George,” 
she said finally, “you won’t live but 
a few years longer. What will I do 
when you die?” 

He stared blankly. “Die? Me? 
Die?” He paused to consider the 
possibility. 

She began to pull away, forcing 
him to tighten his grasp. In the strug- 
gle her long hair had slipped its 
fastenings and whipped about as she 


IN THE OLIGOCENE 


105 



tossed her head from side to side. 
“George, I want to go back! I want 
people! Let’s go somewhere nearer 
our own time.” 

He drew her closer, ignoring her 
efforts to escape. “We have to com- 
mit ourselves completely to our new 
life, darling. We mustn’t consider re- 
turning to a world that could threaten 
our love. You’ll understand why I’ve 
removed all temptation by destroying 
the time machine.” 

Tenderly he drew her body to his 
as with a single anguished cry she 
fainted. 

P aula awoke sometime after dawn 
huddled near the embers of the 
fire, crying softly at times but for the 
most part silent and withdrawn. Tact- 
fully George left the girl to herself. 
He’d feared this reaction, though he 
was sure it would be only temporary. 
She’d had a shock, a great one, and 
of course the knowledge of her own 
narrowly averted death wasn’t as vivid 
to her as it was to him. But soon she’d 
accept the reasonableness of his ac- 
tions, come to his arms and fulfill his 
love. 

After a long period of brooding 
silence she rose and came toward 
him, swaying unsteadily. Her face 
was grime-streaked from crying, her 
eyes red and swollen. With a 
trembling -hand she plucked at his 
sleeve, “George, is it possible . ? 
Maybe you could make a new ma- 
chine. The parts. You couldn’t 
have destroyed all the parts.” 

He turned away; there was no use 
talking to her when she was like this. 
Too many ugly scenes had already 
marred their relationship. She went 


on: “I just want to see people again. 
There’s no one here.” 

“There’s me,” he sakL 
“Yes, of course there’s you, George. 
But I hardly know you. I mean, I 
hardly knew you when — when you 
were young. We weren’t really close.” 
George shook his head violently, as 
if to dislodge the hateful words. With- 
out looking at the girl he circled 
around her to the cave entrance, 
kicked at the few remaining embers 
of the fire. In the cold dawn the 
parched earth stretched flat and life- 
less before him, broken only by the 
trickle of a nearby stream. “We were 
closer than you’d ever admit,” he said 
finally. “If it hadn’t been for your 
mother there wouldn’t have been any 
trouble between us at all.” 

“Oh, George!” she said behind 
him. It was a statement of utter, 
hopeless despair. “My mother likes 
you, George. She’s — she was always 
telling me what a fine boy you were, 
what a — a good catch!” 

“Well, your father, then. Some- 
body was always trying to turn you 
against me. If we’d just been alone 
together for awhile I could have 
made you see. ...” He turned, 
smiled into her stained, twisted face. 
“But now we are alone together, 
aren’t we? You’ll see how much you 
really care now that there’s no one 
around to talk against me.” His gaze 
turned inward, and a half-smile 
touched his lips. “Do you know that 
last night was the first time -I’d ever 
held you in my arms, even been that 
dose to you? It was just as I’d al- 
ways imagined it” 

“George there must be some way 
of rebuilding the machine.” 


106 


IF 



He turned back to look out over 
the plains. “I’ve left nothing to 
chance/’ he said. 

Behind him she was sobbing again. 
“God, I wish you’d left me therel I 
wish I were dead instead of here?” 
Tightening his jaw he contiikiied 
to stare into die distance. He would 
not give in and console her. She’d 
have to accept him on his own terms, 
admit her love without being coaxed. 
She’d have to agree that he’d been 
right in what he’d done. He had 
plenty of time to wait. 

“Don’t cry, darling,” said a male 
voice behind him. 

H e wheeled to face the other man: 
tall, thirty ish, draped in a shim- 
mering scarlet tunic. The man had 
placed one arm about Paula’s shoul- 
ders and was dabbing at her eyes with 
a blue handkerchief. Behind him glit- 
tered a machine of cool crystal and 
shining cylinders. “There’s no need 
to cry,” the man told the astonished 
girl. “We’re going back.” 

Frozen George watched him guide 
her gently toward the machine. 
Then the spell was broken, and he 
lunged forward to reach out for her. 
Paula drew hack, dinging to the 
stranger’s arm. “She’s mine,” George 
told him . “She’s all Tve got!” 

The other man stepped in front 
of the girl, shook his head grimly. 
“No, you have nothing. You’re al- 
ready old and you’re going to die 
shortly. I know. If the girl stays 
here — ” He winced at some un- 
bearable memory. “I passed through 
here,” he said, “about fifteen years 
from now. I found her then. I could 
see how beautiful, how fine she once 


must have been. But she was nearly 
mad, a living corpse. Fifteen years of 
total isolation had almost finished 
her. But even so, I loved her.” He 
smiled tenderly at the girl nestled 
against his shoulder, then at George. 
“I couldn’t save her then, but I can 
now. She has to be safe, protected.” 
He was smiling now with the inno- 
cence that only confident virtue can 
bestow. “I’ve come, you see, to res- 
cue her.” ^ 

Still cradling the girl, the man 
stepped back into the machine and 
flicked a switch; the cylinders sang 
their high, keening whine. “Wait!” 
George screamed after him. “What 
year?” 

The man laughed. “Around 2084.” 
he said. Their figures paled, van- 
ished. 

George stood alone, staring into 
emptiness. After awhile he went over 
and picked up the blue dress from 
the floor where Paula had discarded 
it. Gently he caressed it between his 
fingers, then pr essed it to his face to 
breath in the lingering scent of her 
body. With a puffed sleeve he caught 
the tears. 

Soon he felt better. Putting aside 
the dress he began to rummage 
around among the boxes for his tods. 
He spread them out on the floor, then 
went to the back of the cave and 
dragged out the large, unmarked 
crates he had hidden there. He began 
to remove the cod crystals, the shin- 
ing cylinders, ranged them neatly in- 
to glittering rows. HeM left nothing 
to chance. 

“2084,” he whispered. 

He began to fit the parts together.

IF • Short Story 



by WIN MARKS 

What sort of disease is totally 
incurable? It was no academic 
question to Nick — he had it! 


W hat was happening was far 
from apparent during the ear- 
lier days of the epidemic. When a 
guy is sick he expects to get well. 
His doctor expects him to get well. 
His worst enemy expects him to get 
well — unless the illness is declared 
terminal. 

I think I might have been one of 
the first to notice what was happen- 
ing, or maybe I was just the first to 
give it a second thought. And that 
could be because I had less on my 
mind to distract me. 

I was panhandling during sum- 
mer vacation, bed panhandling, that 
is, after my second year of pre-med- 
ics. The work of a hospital orderly 
at the Cape was demanding only in 
the hours you put in. My duties con- 
sisted mainly of gathering specimens 


from the hordes of astronauts dur- 
ing their months of quarantine and 
debriefing after their return from 
out there. 

They were a crummy lot as a rule. 
First thing you did was hose them 
down so you could stand to be in 
the same room with them. Then you 
took scrapings and samples of spu- 
tum, exhalation and excretions for. 
the lab boys, to see if they’d brought 
anything back with them they hadn’t 
left with. Then an intern, made up 
like a surgeon, would take a 6cc 
blood sample. 

T oivo Leskinenn, Storek e e p e r 
First Class, left Earth an albino, 
and returned from planet-hopping in 
the 9th System a pink-cheeked, 
brown-eyed, black-haired stranger.

His Finnish features and finger- 
prints were unchanged. But what 
shook me up was that after nineteen 
months of typical strain and priva- 
tion in space, Physical Therapy re- 
ported him in perfect condition. No 
emaciation or digestive problems, 
and surprisingly little perspiration ac- 
cumulation. 

While the medics were marveling 
over the change in Toivo’s hair and 
eye-color, I was thinking more about 
how exceptionally healthy he appear- 
ed. He bounced out of his sauna and 
stood under the cold shower for ten 
minutes singing folk songs to him- 
self. 

Then he came out, shook like a 
dog and sprayed me with a huge 
sneeze. That’s when I caught the 
bug. 

The incubation period, as I think 
of it, was eight days. On the ninth, 
I had three eggs and halfa pound of 
bacon for breakfast, a 16 -ounce 
steak for lunch and half a gallon of 
beef stew for dinner. Which was not 
bad for a light eater like me. 

I went to bed early to digest and 
to reflect over my sudden appetite. 
But I fell asleep at once, fully ex- 
pecting to feel awful in the middle 
of the night. 

Instead, I awoke to a remarkable 
sensation of well-being, physically 
and mentally. I was first one in the 
shower for a change, and I emerged 
with a soul-satisfying sneeze that 
wakened my three dormmates. 

Fat Paul stirred, sniffled and mut- 
tered, “You’re catching my damned 
cold.” 

Among them, Paul, Harry and 
Solly kept a nasty cold going all 


the time. Although I had been im- 
mune to colds all my life, I wonder- 
ed if he might be right. Then I no- 
ticed that the annoying post-nasal 
drip with which I was born was gone. 
I stepped out onto our private patio 
facing the sunrise and breathed in 
the bland early morning Florida air 
while I toweled myself. 

Solly came out in his robe, step- 
ping gingerly so as not to jiggle the 
bags under his eyes. Unlike the rest 
of us, Solly was a full-time, year- 
around orderly with a magic feel for 
the dice and a perpetual hangover 
from boozing away the money he 
won in the floating games. 

He grunted, “You look like you 
just discovered the sunrise.” 

I said, “I feel wonderful this morn- 
ing, Solly.” 

Harry came out in his shorts, hol- 
low-chested and wan from sharing 
Fat Paul’s cold. “How come you 
never get infected, Nick?” he asked. 
“I manage to pick up every cruddy 
bug the astros bring back. You don’t 
even catch a cold.” 

At twenty, you don’t think much 
about your health as long as you’re 
not hurting, but this morning on 
the way to the hospital at Cape K. 
I found myself pitying the chronic 
ills of my fellow workers and appre- 
ciating a new awareness of my lusty 
physical ity. And I thought back to 
Toivo Leskinenn and his fantastic 
resistance to the ravages of prolong- 
ed space exploration on alien plan- 
ets. 


A 


fortnight later I had something 


else to 




ter. The required 


semi-monthly physical checkup show- 


THE CURE-ALL 


109 



ed I had gained half an inch in 
height and ten much-needed pounds, 
in spite of my appetite having di- 
minished to its usual birdlike norm. 

It was trying to rain when I park- 
ed my electro next to Harry’s in 
front of our little beach hut in the 
dorm complex on a Wednesday 
night. Low barometer. That meant 
Fat Paul’s sinuses would be hurting. 

They were all there as I hauled 
in a little late, but nothing else was 
as usual. Skinny Harry was gulping 
a thick, homemade milkshake while 
Fat Paul was sipping a small glass 
of orange juice. It should have been 
the other way around. And a goblet 
of beer, flat and untouched; sat at 
Solly’s elbow. Fat Paul, who never 
went swimming because of his si- 
nuses, was trying to talk Solly into 
the loan of his swimming trunks. 

“You’ll split ’em,” Solly was say- 
ing as I came in. “But go ahead. 
Just buy me a new pair if you wreck 
them.” 

A minute later Fat Paul surprised 
us all by racing across the beach in- 
to the surf in Solly’s trunks and nary 
a split. “That boy’s lost some weight,” 
Harry observed thoughtfully. 

I said, “How long has he been on 
this orange juice kick?” 

He shrugged, and Solly asked, 
“How long you been off cigarettes, 
Nick?” 

We looked at each other. Then we 
all stared at Solly’s flat beer, still 
untasted. “Funny thing,” he said. 
“Ever since I started sneezing the 
other day I sort of lost my taste 
for the stuff. And I notice we’ve all 
been sneezing more than usual.” 

Harry said, ‘“You and Paul and 


I kinda gorged ourselves night be- 
fore last. I always come down with 
Paul’s cold when I eat too much.” 

I said, “Paul hasn’t had a cold for 
almost a week,” which not-so-fat 
Paul confirmed a minute later as he 
came dripping out of the ocean. 

We got no further in our probe 
of the situation at that time because 
the phone hooted four times. This 
meant, push the will-comply button 
and don’t bother to pick up the re- 
ceiver. All four of us were wanted 
at the base decontam unit on the 
double. 

Paul wrapped on a terrycloth and 
went in Harry’s electro. Solly went 
with me. “Damn!” Solly muttered. 
“‘I was hoping not to catch extra 
duty tonight.” 

“Missing a big game tonight?” I 
asked. 

“Game, shmame! They’ve retrieved 
the Rook 17 from dead orbit like 
they talked about trying this after- 
noon. That means we got a lot of 
sick people on our hands. Nothing 
else is heading in that would call 
for hoot-owl duty.” 

I t was indeed the Rook 17 tilted at 
a crazy angle on the docking 
pad. The regular swing-shift order- 
lies had already removed all living 
crewmen, some 42 out of the com- 
plement of 58 who had signed on for 
interstellar explo three years ago. 
There wasn’t too much for us to do 
at first. 

For a change there were more 
medics around than orderlies and 
nurses. The place was crawling with 
brass of every military denomina- 
tion.

IF 



Not a natural-born eager beaver, 
Solly nevertheless was determined to 
elbow his way through in time to 
show a prompt punch-in time, which 
made for a clean record and more 
overtime pay regardless of how little 
you accomplished after you made 
the clock go “ding.” 

In his hurry he jostled a large fe- 
male navy nurse, who scowled at 
him. “What’s the rush, Baggy-eyes?” 
Then she backed off and blinked 
through her bi-contacts. “Well, Sol- 
ly, on the wagon long?” 

Then it came to me. My room- 
mate’s droopy lids were wide open, 
the whites of his eyes snowy as a 
fresh pillowcase and the bags under 
them almost completely smoothed 
out. “Where’s the action?” he asked 
without dignifying her question with 
a reply. 

“Third deck below. Ward C. 
They’ve got them all in there, and if 
you two are on duty help get some 
ice pronto.” 

We found Harry and Paul already 
at the ice-bins scooping the large 
poly buckets full of chips. “Big fev- 
ers, I guess,” said Paul as he backed 
away with a full pail in each hand. 

Night nurse Roark came up and 
snatched one of his dripping buck- 
ets. “They caught something big out 
there, and it wasn’t salmon. The 
poor devils are burning up:” 

No less than an air force chicken 
colonel medic blocked our way to 
the down escalator. He pointed to 
the open-door size aperture across 
the corridor. ‘“Take the chute, damn- 
it! They need that ice down there!” 
You get good velocity down a 
three-floor chute and you land run- 


ning, which was the idea . through 
double doors into Ward C, which 
had been set up with several rows 
of narrow trough-like beds lined 
with rubbery sheets. Harry and Paul 
finished covering one incumbent, but 
Solly and I were directed to one of 
the remaining cadaverous torsos that 
wore nothing but a blistering red 
blush. As I leaned over to empty my 
ice pails I could feel the man’s body 
heat on my bare arms at least a foot 
above him. And from the pitiable 
look of his emaciated frame, he had 
little fuel left on his bones to sup- 
port the energy loss. His cheeks 
were sucked in like he had a mouth- 
ful of vacuum, and his eyes bugged 
like he was trying to spit it out. I 
was at the feet, Solly at the chest. 
And just as we were both emptying 
our second buckets of ice chips on 
the hopeless carcass, Solly sneezed 
right in the patient’s face. 

T he OIC standing over us wore a 
sanitary oxygen mask through 
which he screamed, “Oh, hell! That’s 
all these guys need right now, a good 
old-fashioned case of pneumonia.” 
He turned to me, and I could see he 
was wearing a star on each shoulder. 
“Orderly,” he commanded, pointing 
at Solly, get that goddamned or- 
derly out of here and put him on re- 
port!” 

I grabbed Solly by the arm and 
hustled him back upstairs where 
Solly shook my hand from his arm. 
He said, ‘Thanks for the tow job, 
but what are you trying to do?” 
“You heard the Officer In 
Charge,” I said. “I’ve got to put you 
on report.” 


THE CURE-ALL

“The oik was exceeding his au- 
thority. We’re not in the military. If 
you report me to the super I’ll have 
to punch out on the time clock be- 
fore the extra shift is over and I’ll 
get docked.” 

“This is all true,” I said, “but you 
did sneeze in the ward, and I think 
this is pretty rotten • . to bring a 
cold into a roomful of guys already 
dying of God knows what.” 

“I haven’t got a cold!” 

“You sneezed. Why?” 

“Well, not on purpose, for damn- 
ed sure. Maybe some pollen these 
guys brought back with them.” 

The patients had already been 
through scrubdown, so this was 
highly unlikely. I said as much. 

Solly jutted his jaw into my face. 
“Look, Nick, we’ve been friends. But 
if you report me you are going to 
lose my friendship and several front 
teeth, and I don’t think you want 
that to happen.” 

I admitted, “This is also true, and 
come to think of it, I’d be just plain 
squealing, wouldn’t I? Since, as you 
say, we’re not in the military.” 
He relaxed. “Yeah, like I said. 
And since we’re banished for the 
moment we might as well get a bite 
to eat. I’ll buy you a burger.” 
Before we were through eating 
Paul and Harry came into the cafe- 
teria. As they sat down with us Sol- 
ly asked, “You guys allergic to work, 
too?” 

Harry said, “No. Just ice. We 
sneezed in the ward.” 

Paul added, “Real excitable oik 
down there. He told us to put each 
other on report, but we thought we’d 
have a bowl of chili first.” His grin 


spelled out their lack of intent to en- 
gage in mutual recriminations to the 
superintendent. 

I was still worry-warting. “Sup- 
pose some of those men do come 
down with a cold on top of — ” 
Paul said, “Who’s got a cold? I 
haven’t heard so much as a sniffle 
in our hut for days.” 

Solly turned to me. “Nick, will 
you forget it? That oik has more on 
his mind than clobbering a few slob 
orderlies for sneezing, when we were 
risking our necks in that quarantine 
hell-hole to begin with. He’ll never 
think of us again unless we are stu- 
pid enough to put ourselves on re- 
port.” 

Solly was wrong. 

I n the weeks remaining before I 
was to return to college, my con- 
viction grew that Astronaut Toivo 
Leskinenn, recently in space, had 
contracted and passed on to me 
something very contagious that I 
could only name a condition of per- 
fect health. Even more: A compul- 
sion to preserve my physical perfec- 
tion. Even as Solly had given up 
drinking, I no longer had any use 
for tobacco. Even as Paul had trim- 
med off his burdensome overweight, 
Skinny Harry and I filled out to an 
optimum padding of firm flesh. 

For all four of us the syndrome 
included a periodic day of enormous 
appetite followed by a morning-after 
unexplainable explosion of a sneeze 
or sneezes. 

But how do you catch a condition 
of health, when the only definition 
to date was the absence of disease? 
Where Solly, Paul and Harry had 


112 


IF 



been wrong was in assuming that the 
OIC at their little sneezing party in 
Ward C was just some hysterical 
nut, and that nothing they had done 
was of enough consequence that the 
oik would bother to follow through 
with his intended discipline. 

About two weeks after the inci- 
dent we were all called to the “pen- 
tagon," as we .called the penthouse 
atop the decontam building, where 
Solly was summarily fired, and the 
rest of us were chewed out. Sneezing 
was not the charge. It was for in- 
subordination in not carrying out or- 
ders. 

Nurse Roark was the one to catch 
the dirty duty. She concluded her 
tirade with, “Solly, you should have 
known better.” 

Solly was shook. He said, “You 
mean they’re blaming us for the 
fact that all but three patients in 
Ward C finally died?” 

“No. The fever did that. It just 
turns out that the medical officer 
whose orders you all disobeyed that 
night happened to be the surgeon 
general himself." 

“He had a mask on," Solly ex- 
plained, more to himself than to any- 
one else. “The dice have gone cold 
on me lately, too.” 

Nurse Roark was not a bad scout 
at all. She simply had a nasty job to 
do, and she tried to make up for it. 
Knowing that being fired from the 
Cape on such a charge would black- 
list Solly from coast to coast, she 
tipped him off to an orderly job in 
India. It seemed things were getting 
out of hand over there again, and 
we were lend-leasing some more 
birth-control clinics to dispense in- 


formation and be pills. Solly’s thanks 
was a stolid nod of acceptance and 
a giant sneeze right in Nurse Roark’s 
face. 

While he was packing his bag that 
night, Solly said, “I can’t imagine 
what an orderly does around a place 
like that, but at least it’s out-patient." 
And we appreciated what he meant. 
No more bedpans. 

T he last week of school vacation 
the three of us remaining spent 
in a special decontam isolation of 
our own while we underwent rigid 
tests to be sure we weren’t packing 
anything to the inner world of civi- 
lization that we’d caught from the 
astronauts. 

On the second day of our tests all 
hell began to come loose at the 
seams. It started after lunch when a 
security officer questioned us for 
three hours straight in an obvious 
try to discredit our identities. He 
worked remotely through a video 
screen. Then we had to press our 
thumbs to a camera for live inspec- 
tion of our prints. Next our eyeballs 
were subjected to long scrutiny. No 
answers to our demands for explan- 
ations. 

After her duty shift Nurse Roark 
phoned us in a hushed voice. I said, 
“How are you?” 

She whispered, “I’m fine. Too 
fine, in fact. But what the devil 
are they grilling you guys about?” 

I replied, “You tell me. We sure 
don’t know.” 

She hesitated. Then, “Well, it’s 
something important. The surgeon- 
general is flying down from Wash- 
ington again, and you guys are the 


THE CURE-ALL 


113 



subject matter. I’ll see what more I 
can find out. You sure you haven’t 
any clues?” 

I said, “None to speak of,” and 
I meant just that. By now I was pos- 
itive that, like Toivo Leskinenn, I 
was the carrier of some contagious 
and powerful life-force , and so were 
Harry and Paul, and so, probably, 
was Nurse Roark. 

On the morning of our third day 
of isolation I awoke with the now- 
familiar ravenous appetite. Paul 
watched me pack away the giant 
breakfast I had ordered. He com- 
mented, “And to think I used to eat 
that way every meal!” 

At about ten the surgeon-general 
appeared on our screen, eyeing us 
with tenseness almost as great as I 
remembered the night of Solly’s 
fateful sneeze. Without the sanitary 
mask to conceal it, his gray, military 
mustache bunched visibly over puck- 
ered lips. He began firmly if infor- 
mally, “Now, Nicholas, we want an-, 
swers.” 

It turned out that what they real- 
ly wanted was explanations for our 
answers. The polygraph had shown 
that we apparently thought we’d been 
answering truthfully. But why had I 
insisted that I had had surgery for 
the removal of my appendix . 
also the removal of a large cyst at 
the base of my spine? 

I said, “I’ll show you! I checked 
in with this scar and Fve still ...” 

But by now I had jerked out my 
shirttail and made half a liar out of 
myself. 

“Yes, when you checked into 
Decontam an appendectomy scar 
was recorded in the records of the 


man you claim to be,” said the s.g. 
“What have you done with it?” 

A surgery scar on your belly is 
not something you examine daily 
like you might your fingernails. I 
was unprepared for the question. 

In the silence the s.g. continued, 
“And you, Harry. You had a pat- 
tern of pigmented moles on your 
back. They are gone. Any ideas 
why?” 

H arry was staring at his still bare 
belly. He said, “I’ll take your 
word about my moles, and the an- 
swer is no. What has been going on 
with us guys, Nick?” 

I turned to Paul. “You got any 
theory?” 

He shook his head. “All I know 
is that I’ve been feeling terrific since 
I took off all that weight. Not even 
a cold.” 

I turned back to the video where 
the s.g. was staring at us with cool 
patience. As ridiculous as I sounded 
to my own ears I started speaking 
the thoughts that had been gather- 
ing for weeks. “Sir,” I began re- 
spectfully, “I think I have been 
spreading an epidemic of — of 
health!” 

Oddly enough the s.g. did not find 
this statement more than he could 
field. “It’s a cinch you’re not spread- 
ing the chickenpox,” he observed. 
“But why do you say you have been 
spreading it? Why not the others?” 
“Because they didn’t start it. As a 
matter of fact I don’t think I started 
it, either. But we’ve all probably been 
spreading it.” 

“Then who did start it?” the s.g. 
demanded. 


114 


IF 



“I suspect Captain Leskinenn,” I 
confessed. 

The s.g. turned off camera to ask 
an aide, “Who the devil is Leski- 
nenn?” and was told after a brief 
pause that Captain Toivo Leskinenn 
was long since back in space. Then 
the s.g. remembered. “Oh, yes. He’s 
that albino Finn. Of course. Only 
he’s always been in perfect health. 
Saw him in a service weight-lifting 
match once.” 

The off camera voice reported, 
“But he came back from a planet in 
the 9th System with black hair and 
brown eyes.” 

After a moment of silence the s.g. 
addressed himself to our camera 
again. “And you, Nicholas, think 
you caught this, this . whatever 
the condition . from Captain 
Leskinenn. Did you have direct con- 
tact with him in Decontam?” 

“He sneezed in my face, sir.” 
Then I hurried on to put meat on 
the skeleton of my theory by recall- 
ing the night the s.g. had put Solly, 
Harry and Paul on report for sneez- 
ing in Ward C. 

Again he startled me. “Yes, yes, 
of course. Don’t you think I corre- 
late such happenings? Three healthy 
men sneezed and three out of forty- 
two dying men lived.” 

“Are they really all right now, 
sir?” I blurted. 

But the s.g. was here to get infor- 
mation, not give it. The screen 
blanked out. 

H arry said, “He looked like he 
was about to call a red alert 
for the whole Cape.” 

Paul shook his head at me, “Geez, 


Nick, if we’ve got some kind of out- 
er space bug that makes people get 
well and well people feel better, 
what’s all the flap about?” 

“The uncertainty,” I guessed. “We 
don’t know that it’s just a bug .” 

The s.g.’s voice came back to us. 
The video was on again. “We are 
going to find out and quick. We 
want the next one of you who feels 
a sneeze coming on to do it at this 
petri dish.” He held up a flat, shal- 
low glass pie-pan with straight sides. 
In it were perhaps fifty little swatch- 
es of assorted culture media, pasty 
little patches of glutinous combina- 
tions, each ready to provide a happy 
home for some vagrant microbe or 
virus. A glass lid kept the field ster- 
ile. 

A pre-dawn blastoff awoke me, 
and the first thought I had was that 
I was about to sneeze. I snatched 
the lid off the petri dish and did so, 
infecting, I’m sure, every culture 
patch there. 

Still drunk with unfinished sleep, 
nevertheless I slipped the cover back 
on the dish and dutifully shoved the 
affair through the designated slot in 
the door and went back to sleep. 

Nothing much happened until 
Nurse Roark phoned me that eve- 
ning. “Which one of you guys did 
the sneeze?” 

“Me ” I said. “Why?” 

She breathed into die phone three 
times before answering. Then, “Con- 
gratulations! You are the father of 
NASA’s first serious colonization 
plan.” She sounded bitter, and I told 
her so. 

She said, “Look, Nick, Fm not 
mad at you, or 1 wouldn’t have 


THE CURE-ALL 


115 



bothered calling you. I’m just mad 
at everything. I was bora on this 
earth and I want nothing more than 
to stay on this earth and be buried 
on it. And things aren’t working 
out that way.” 

I said, “Roark, what are you try- 
ing to tell n»r 

“We’re all going bye-bye,” she 
whisper-shouted into tike phone. 

“Where? Why?” I asked bewilder- 
ed. 

“Where, I cannot tell you. Why, 
is because the virus-microbe you 
and your buddies — to, say nothing 
of me and a few dozen other vic- 
tims — are carrying has been iden- 
tified as alien . and totally im- 
mune to every known attack. This 
damned bug is invincible!” 

“So what has it done wrong?” I 
whisper-shouted back at her. “What’s 
so terrible about a bug that goes 
around curing post-nasal drip and 
saving the lives of astronauts who 
catch other things out there?” 

“Nick?” Nurse Roark sobbed soft- 
ly into the phone. “Nick, we haven’t 
contracted a disease. We have be- 
come the host for an alien civiliza- 
tion. A sub-microscopic civilization.” 

i^XTou mean an intelligent para- 
I site?” 

“No!” she said quickly. “Not the 
way the brass interpret it. We have 
been trapped into a symbiotic rela- 
tionship with an invisibly small or- 
gasm we can’t even identify except 
by its actions on the culture media 
and the symptoms of infected hu- 
mans.” 

I said, “Nurse Roark, why don’t 
you get up here and explain? If 


we’ve all got the same bug, what do 
you have to lose?” 

She replied, “Come to think of it, 
there’s no sense sitting out here in 
a phone booth and whispering myself 
hoarse.” Ten minutes later to the 
dot she unlocked our cell and walk- 
ed in with two fifths of booze and 
a jar of cigars, one of which she lit 
before opening her mouth for other 
reasons. 

By now Harry and Paul were up 
to date on the subject and just as 
much mystified. The next thing 
Nurse Roark did was to crush out 
her cigar, stare at the cigar jar, whis- 
ky and us in turn and say, “Aren’t 
you guys glad to see me?” 

“You, yes,” I said. “But the booze 
and tobacco, no. It seems to be a 
common symptom of our affliction 
to lose our taste for stuff like that.” 
Roark screwed up her mouth and 
spat delicately into the farthest cor- 
ner. “I will confirm that. And it 
makes sense. It fits. This Alien lives 
in our liver and brain and kidneys 
and lungs. It knows what chemicals 
are inimical to our survival. And 
since we are the captive hosts at this 
tea party, we get to give up what our 
guests declare unwelcome to them.” 
I said, “If you don’t believe it, 
have a drink of your own booze.” 
Roark shook her head. “Since you 
bring it up, I gag to think of it.” 

I said, “You’re not really serious 
about this colony bit?” 

Roark flopped down on the bunk 
across from me. 

“The s.g. himself has put himself 
into quarantine, and if he develops 
the symptoms he’ll lead the expedi- 
tion. What’s more, I saw him sneeze 


116 


IF 



into a petri dish this very morning, 
so we’ll know by tomorrow.” 

I asked, “If the bug isn’t identi- 
fiable in culture, how do you know 
when you’ve sneezed one?” 

“By the way the culture behaves,” 
she said. “It draws in on itself until 
it looks like a small bean, then it 
explodes like a firecracker. Or would 
you prefer, sneeze?” 

H arry took his head out of his 
hands. “All right We have a 
sub-microscopic alien that treats a 
human individual like a planet, and 
he’s going to do everything he can to 
protect this planet against the exte- 
rior forces that tend to destroy it. 
Right?” 

“I guess so,” said Roark. 

Paul came to life. “And it wants 
to proliferate, so it builds up a lit- 
tle excess population in a given hu- 
man host and then tickles his nose 
into a sneeze. To him our noses 
must appear as pretty great launch- 
ing silos. And who needs rockets 
when you have bellows like our 
lungs at your command?” 

I said, “It sounds to me like we 
should be happy to have such an an- 
tibody around.” 

Roark grabbed one of the whisky 
bottles, uncorked it and shouted to 
the ceiling, “Should a body love an 
antibody, a-comin’ through the 
sky,” and upended the bottle for 
three long gulps, shuddering every 
moment. Then she added half un- 
der her breath, “Sorry, you guys, but 
I didn’t deserve what you did to me.” 
I stared at her. “Roark, do you 
want to tell us what brought that 
on?” 


She replied, “Nick, you are un- 
married. Have you ever been preg- 
nant?” 

I said, “From your question I 
have to gather that you are both un- 
married and pregnant, and that you 
are about to blame this on the little 
bitty invaders.” 

She took another tug on the whis- 
ky bottle and gagged. “I’m a grand- 
mother three times over, and a wid- 
ow for two years. Pregnancy in a 
woman my age is not something to 
be sneezed at. Would you accept my 
condition as a thing I wouldn't have 
risked at any cost?” 

“Oh, now — ” Paul started to ob- 
ject. 

“You forgot to take your pill?” 
Harry suggested. 

“Parthenogenesis!” I said aloud 
but not very. Roark heard and nod- 
ded. 

She said, “Now, do you see why 
everyone under quarantine on the 
base is going bye-bye to NASA's 
first space colony? Just when we 
thought we had the population ex- 
plosion licked!” 

I boggled at the thought of trying 
to trace every track of possible con- 
tamination. “They must have most 
of Florida roped off,” I said. 

Roark shrugged. “I hope so. We’ll 
need quite a few obstetricians out 
there right off the bat.” 

I asked, “How’s that?” 

“Because to my personal knowl- 
edge, every nurse in Decontam is 
with child.” 

“What about the pill?” Harry 
wanted to know. “Isn’t it working?” 

It was more of a sigh than a word, 
but I managed to make out Roark’s 


THE CURE-ALL 


117 



reply to be a wheezy, boozy, “No.” 

I thought it would take them at 
least a couple of years to 
prepare for such a colonization ex- 
pedition to the planets of the Ninth 
System where Toivo Leskinenn was 
to guide us under the supreme med- 
ical supervision of the ex^g., but 
they did it in under eighty days. 
Kept incommunicado as we were.

I had no part of the plans for the 
venture, nor voice to cry out the 
warning to the poor, overcrowded 
planet we were leaving behind. 

I did manage to get one postcard 
mailed past the censors. Probably it 
got by because of its entirely inno- 
cent content. It read merely, “Dear 
Solly, I hope your sniffles are better. 
Give my best to Mother India.”

CLIFF HAWK, is engaged in secret 
and dangerous experiments . She be - 
lieves Hawk is trying to create an 
artificial living organism, a “Rogue 
Star ” which, unlike, the sentient and 
generally benign stellar bodies that 
make up most of the universes pri- 
mary stars, will use its enormous 
powers for disruption and destruc- 
tion . 

Quam hastens to join her . He man- 
ages to get passage through the trans- 
flection network which links worlds 
galaxies apart, making instantaneous 
travel possible between Earth and any 
other planet in civilization. He travels 
millions of parsecs in less time than 
it takes to cross a room. But on Earth 
his progress comes to a halt. 

It is Starday . On backward Earth, 
where the symbiosis among men, fu- 
sorians and stars has taken the form 
of a ritualistic religion, this means 
nothing can be done. He cannot go 
to her. He cannot reach her by com- 
municator. He cannot secure a guide. 
He can only wait. 

But Molly Zaldivar hasn't waited. 
Alone she has gone to the cavern in 
the mountains where Hawk and his 
partner, THE REEFER, a mysterious 
man from space, are conducting their 
experiments. 

As she approaches the cave , she is 
terrified to see a SLEETH, a space 
creature the size of a horse, capable 
of traveling at enormous speeds by 
transflection methods, deadly as an 
interstellar space-destroyer, guarding 
the entrance. An explosion knocks 
her out and drives the sleeth away; 
Cliff Hawk and the Reefer find her 
and bring her into the cave. 

Meanwhile Andy Quam has found 


some boys who tell him something of 
what has been happening with Molly 
Zaldivar. Unable to control his pa- 
tience, Quam storms into a Starday 
meeting and demands that the moni- 
tor, a robot, help him. The robot re- 
fuses at first. But then , when three 
bolts of energy ' from the sun lash 
down and strike at the mountains 
where the cave is located, the robot 
relents and agrees to take Quam 
there. 

It is almost too late. The danger 
Molly Zaldivar warned about has 
come to pass. The experiment has 
succeeded; a Rogue Star has been 
created . and it is now beyond 
human control . 

IX 

F irst the robot required them to 
wait while it completed its min- 
ute of silent adoration, bobbing in its 
transflection field under the star-em- 
bossed dome of the church, its plasma 
rippling with the colors of devotion. 
Then it insisted on shepherding each 
of the children out of the building, 
locking the doors behind them, 
searching each empty room and cor- 
ridor to make sure none had been 
forgotten. The church was homeo- 
static, of course; its receptors and 
proprioceptors could have taken care 
of all of that without attention. Then 
the robot proposed another delay 
while it transmitted an apparently 
endless message to Deneb; and all the 
while the boy, Rufe, was chattering 
with questions and eagerness, and 
Andy Quam’s patience had long gone 
up in wrath. “Robot Inspector,” he 
shouted, “if we’re going, let’s go! 


120 


IF 



Molly Zaldivar may be in great dan- 
ger, even dying!” 

The robot swung toward him. 
“Monitor Quamodian,” it sang, “pa- 
tience! I assure you she is alive.” 
“How do you know?” he demand- 
ed. 

The robot was silent. 

“Preacher,” the boy whispered, 
“leave him alone. That’s the way he 
is. Does things at his own pace. Say! 
Are we going to ride his back?” 
“Almalik! How do I know?” groan- 
ed Andy Quam. He glanced at his 
wrist-timepiece, converted rapidly to 
Terrestrial equivalents and hissed 
with exasperation. “In three hours 
Starday will be over. I won’t need 
him then! But,” he added painfully, 
tapping his foot on the tiled floor, 
“Molly needs me now . .” 

The robot sang, “Monitor Quamo- 
dian, please be silent. I am having a 
most interesting discussion with three 
living companions on a planet of 
Deneb, eight robots and the star 61 
Cygni.” 

“No!” roared Quamodian in aston- 
ishment. “You’re not chattering away 
at a time like this! But you prom- 
ised — ” 

The robot paused. Then, petulant- 
ly. “Oh, very well. Perhaps we may 
as well go, since your noise is disturb- 
ing me. Please follow — ” But it was 
too late for following; Andy Quam 
was already out the door, leaping to- 
ward the place where he had left his 
flyer, and the boy was chugging after 
him like a comet-tail. “I’ll lead the 
way,” sang the robot, raising the 
amplification of its external vocalizers 
until the church facade rang with the 
echo. “I have instructed your guiding 


apparatus that the hundred-meter lim- 
it may be waived, as part of my 
voluntary Starday activity, permitted 
under the compact. ...” But even 
at ninety decibels Andy Quam didn’t 
hear the end of the sentence; he Was 
already in the flyer, the boy close be- 
hind; he slammed the door and shdtit- 
ed: 

“Let’s go! Follow that robot!” 

“All right, Mr. Quamodian,” 
cheerfully agreed the voice of his 
flyer. “I have my clearance now. Say! 
Wasn’t it nice of the Robot Inspector 
to let you — ” 

“Shut up,” snarled Andy Quam. 
“Just fly! I’m in a hurry.” 

S ulkily the flyer lifted itself off the 
ground, spun round like a top 
and aimed itself toward the waiting 
ovoid that was the robot, hanging in 
its transflection fields a few meters 
over the Starchurch. Quamodian mut- 
tered a curse as he picked himself up 
from where the sudden gyration had 
thrown him, the boy in his lap; but 
he said nothing to the flyer. “You sit 
there,” he ordered Rufe. “Strap your- 
self in. Almalik knows what this stu- 
pid flyer will do next.” 

Aggrieved, the flyer began, “That’s 
not fair, Mr. Qua — ” 

“I told you to shut up!” 

The flyer shut up, with an audible, 
and intentional, click and rasp of 
static, and Andy Quam and the boy 
peered away. It was full night, with 
bright stars hanging over the hills, 
though to the west the angry red 
glare of the swollen, surly sun was 
still faintly visible, bloodying the sky 
over the horizon. Suddenly the boy 
grabbed Quamodian’s arm.

ROGUE STAR 



“There, preacher! See it? That’s 
where the sunbolts struck.” 

“I see,” Andy Quam ground out. 
“Flyer, can’t we go any faster?” 
Resentfully the voice clicked itself 
on. “No,” it said, and clicked off 
again. 

“Now, stop that!” shouted Quamo- 
dian. “Why not?” 

The flyer relented. “The Robot In- 
spector has issued orders for us to 
follow it,” it pointed out. “If I go 
any faster it will be following us” 
Its voice mellowed as it settled down 
for a nice chat. “You see, Mr. Quam- 
odian,” it said, “it is still Starday, 
and the Robot Inspector does not 
wish to offend the peace of Starday 
with a sonic boom. This planet has a 
rather dense atmosphere, composed 
principally of oxygen (twenty per 
cent), nitrogen (eighty per cent), 


water vapor, carbon dioxide — ” 
“Skip that part! I know Earth’s 
atmosphere!” 

“Of course. The point is, Mr. 
Quamodian, that at these parameters 
of altitude, temperature and baro- 
metric pressure the sonic barrier oc- 
curs at just a bit over our present 
speed. So you see, no, Mr. Quamo- 
dian, we cannot go any faster . 
and in any event,” it added chattily, 
“we are there.” 

T he flyer deposited them on the 
side of the mountain; the Robot 
Inspector would not allow it any 
closer to the cavemouth. Andy Quam 
and the boy piled out, stared upward 
at the wreck. “Stars, preacher! They 
really got it!” whispered the boy. 
“I — I’m afraid Miss Zaldivar was 
hit.” 

“We have no such information,” 
sang the robot, humming overhead. 
“Please wait. I am scanning the 
area.” 

But Andy Quam was past the point 
of caring what the robot inspector 
wanted. He thrust the boy aside and 
scrambled up the side of the hill, 
over uneven ground. He dodged 
around the wreck of a vehicle — then 
realized it must be Molly Zaldivar’s 
and stopped, his heart in his mouth, 
until a frantic search convinced him 
she was not in it, nor anywhere 
around. Then up that hill again, his 
legs pumping, his heart pounding. 

Although in truth, reason was say- 
ing in his ear, it was past the time 
for haste. What destruction had been 
accomplished here, and it was vast, 
was long over. Coarse brown smoke 
oozed from the cave mouth above, 



and there was a stink of charred plas- 
tic and smoldering trash of a thou- 
sand kinds. But the fire had burned 
itself out. No one was in sight. 

He paused, his lungs seared with 
the violence of his breathing, and 
forced himself to shout: “Molly! Are 
you here?” ' • ; ■ - - - 

The robot voice sang startlingly 
from 'just behind him, “She is fifty 
meters to your right, Monitor Quam- 
odian, and just above us. But do not 
approach.” 

Andy Quam was already on his 
way, scrambling around the lip of the 
little ledge before the cave mouth. 

“No, wait! There are unpredictable 
entities about, Monitor Quamodian. 
A beast from space. And — ” the 
singing whine of the robot faltered 
— “the rogue star. Allow me to study 
them!” 


ROGUE STAR 


123 


Andy Quam snorted, but made no 
other answer. He slid on loose gravel, 
caught himself and ran on. It was a 
forty-foot drop; he had just escaped 
death, but he had not even noticed it 
in his haste to find Molly Zaldivar. 
But where was she? 

And then he stopped, sliding and 
waving his arms to keep from falling. 

Something like a giant black cat 
was leaping toward him, up over the 
rubble and the smoke, shimmering 
in a pale transflection field. In the 
dim starlight he caught a glimpse of 
great blind eyes staring at him, claws 
that could rip the guts out of a pyro- 
pod. “Monitor Quamodian!” sang the 
robot peremptorily from behind. 
“That creature is a sleeth. Do not, I 
caution you, approach it!” 

There was suddenly a sour, cop- 
pery taste of fear in Quamodian’s 
mouth. A sleeth — now he recalled 
the stories about those space beasts, 
bred for killing, powerful beyond 
human competition. If it took a mind 
to attack him there would be no 
hope. 

But it seemed to have no such in- 
tention. It hung there studying him, 
almost as though it had intelligence, 
even empathy, even understanding of 
his haste. Then, as though it were 
giving permission, it lifted up and 
away on its transflection fields and 
hung waiting, a hundred meters up, 
no longer between him and the little 
hummock where he could see shad- 
owy forms. 

He spared the sleeth no more 
thought but scrambled, slid and trot- 
ted the remaining distance and drop- 
ped to his knees beside the girl who 
had summoned him across half the 


known universe. “Molly!” he cried. 
“What’s happened? What have they 
done to you?” 

He crooked an arm under her 
head, raised her tenderly. 

And her eyes opened. 

She looked at him wonderingly, 
like a child awakened from sleep. 
Her face was bloody, scratched, 
smudged with soot and filth. Her hair 
was flying loose as chaff on a breeze, 
and her clothes were shredded into 
rags. But suddenly and gloriously she 
smiled at him. “Why, it’s little Andy 
Quam,” she whispered. “I should 
have known you’d come.” 

The smile lingered, only a second 
more. Then, without warning, her 
face twisted, the smile fled, she turned 
her head away. And Molly Zaldivar 
wept as though her heart would 
break. 

4 C T> °bot .Inspector!” shouted An- 

AV- dy Quam. “Where is that 
fool machine?” 

From the side of a boulder, ten 
feet away, a small voice said queru- 
lously, “He’s gone, preacher. Just 
zipped away. Almalik knows where. 
Didn’t say a word.” 

“What are you doing here, Rufe?” 
Andy Quam demanded. “You should 
stay in the flyer. Well, as long 
as you’re here, give me a hand. Miss 
Zaldivar’s been hurt. We’ve got to get 
her to help — ” 

A figure disengaged itself from the 
gloom and stepped closer. “No hurry 
about that, friend,” it rumbled. “She 
lived through this much, she’ll live a 
while yet.” 

Quamodian jumped to his feet, 
ready for anything. He peered into 


124 


IF 



the darkness, caught a glimpse of 
dulled yellow mustache, dingy yellow 
beard, a face that looked as though 
planets had rolled over it in their or- 
bits. “Who the devil are you?” he 
barked. 

“Talk big for a little fellow, don’t 
you?” rasped the voice. “No harm. 
No hard feelings.” He stepped closer, 
and Quamodian got the measure of 
the size of him, a giant of a man, 
but oddly subdued. “No one around 
here wants trouble,” he added in a 
mild bass growl. “Not any more. But 
the girl’s all right, I got her out of 
the tunnel before she got hurt” 
Quam said suspiciously, “I heard 
something about a Reefer up here 
with Cliff Hawk, doing Almalik 
knows .what foul work. Are you 
him?” 

“I am.” 

“Then that’s your sleeth watching 
us up there.” 

The Reefer’s mustache and beard 
parted company. In the gloom it 
looked almost as though he were pre- 
paring to bite Andy Quam, but it was 
only a soundless, humorless laugh. 
“Not mine any more,” he declared. 
“His own by now, I expect. Or — 
something’s. But he won’t take orders 
from me, not since the sun hit us.” 
He turned aside from Andy Quam, 
bent for a moment over the girl. 
“She’s all right,” he said, straighten- 
ing, but his voice didn’t sound very 
sure. “You might be right about get- 
ting her out of here, though. Me too, 
if you don’t mind.” 

“Why is Molly Zaldivar crying like 
that?” Quamodian demanded. “If 
you’ve hurt her — ” 

The great head shook from side to 


side. “Nothing I did,” he said. “I 
expect it’s Cliff Hawk she’s crying 
about” 

Quamodian pulled himself togeth- 
er. Why, he had completely forgotten 
that Hawk was here! It was his fault* 
no doubt, that Molly Zaldivar had 
been hurt, endangered, terrified; yet 
still there was enough friendship left 
between Quamodian and Cliff Hawk 
that Andy Quam’s voice showed real 
concern as he asked, “What about 
Hawk? Is he hurt?” 

“Not any more.” 

“What? You mean — dead?” 

The great voice tolled leadenly. 
“Not that either. Worse, I’d say. A 
lot worse. And if you want my opin- 
ion, we ought to get away from here 
before something worse happens to 
us, too.” 

T he Something that had been a 
random mass of stripped elec- 
trons, then an infant rogue star, then 
a seeking, learning, experimenting 
entity — and was now something else 
— “watched” the Reefer and Andy 
Quam gently lifting the weeping girl, 
carrying her down the slope to the 
flyer, hastily entering, slamming the 
door, racing away. 

With one part of itself, the rogue 
caused the sleeth to soar after on its 
transflection fields, keeping the flyer 
effortlessly in view. It was not neces- 
sary to do that, of course. The rogue 
could easily have kept the flyer under 
observation with its probes, anywhere 
on the face of this planet and indeed 
almost anywhere in this solar system. 
(It had not yet had occasion to try 
to perceive anything farther away 
than the planets.) 


ROGUE STAR

But it was no longer the simple 
creature it had been. 

When it had perceived that one of 
the organized radiant masses was in 
danger of extinction it had occurred 
to its still-simple mind that it might 
be worth acquiring, and so it had ac- 
quired it. It turned out to be easy — 
a “stretch,” a “grasp,” a “hold.” If it 
had been matter doing these things, 
one might have said that it was like 
the flow of an amoeba, englobing 
and digesting a tasty bit of food. 
Matter was not involved, and the 
forces that the rogue deployed did 
not lend themselves to description in 
three-space geometry. 

But the effect was the same. 

What had once been the persona 
of Cliff Hawk no longer inhabited its 
biological body. That body, in fact, 
was not merely dead but by now an 
unrecognizable lump of contorted 
charcoal, in with the other charred 
and destroyed litter in the burned-out 
tunnel, once Hawk’s workshop. 

But something of him remained. It 
no longer had identity of its own, as 
an individual. But it was at least a 
perceptible fraction of that seething, 
restless entity that surged through the 
interstices of the mountain, that fol- 
lowed Andy Quam’s flyer in the per- 
son of the sleeth, that had brought 
the wrath of the sun striking down 
on the summit of the hill, that was a 
newborn rogue star loosed in the uni- 
verse. 

It no longer “thought” in simple 
urges and observations. 

Through the trained intelligence of 
its human component it now could 
observe, analyze, record . and act. 
126 


T echnically it was still Starday; at 
the boy’s suggestion Andy Quam 
ordered the flyer to take them to the 
Starchurch. “There’ll be a crowd for 
late-night services,” he said, “and 
likely enough nobody’s going to be 
where you expect them, otherwise. I 
mean, even the hospital might not 
have a crew on duty.” 

“Shocking,” hissed Andy Quam. 
“To make the Companionship of the 
Star a pagan ritual!” 

“Sure, preacher. Like you say. 
Only that’s the way it is, so you 
better — ” 

“I understand,” said Quam, and 
gave the flyer its directions. It raised 
an objection. 

“Without the special permission of 
the Robot Inspector, Mr. Quamo- 
dian,” it declared, “I should properly 
go nowhere except back to the trans- 
flex terminal.” 

“But it’s an emergency!” 

“Of course, Mr. Quamodian.” It 
hesitated, its neural currents ponder- 
ing the problem. “Since I cannot 
contact the robot inspector at the 
moment,” it decided, “I will have to 
return to the transflex terminal — ” 
“Confound you,” shouted Quamo- 
dian, “do what I tell you!” 

“ — but en route I will pause brief- 
ly at the Starchurch. If you then dis- 
embark, it is not a matter under my 
control.” 

“Hah!” barked Quamodian in dis- 
gust. “Do it then. But do it fast!” 

“It is done, Mr. Quamodian,” sigh- 
ed the flyer, settling to the ground. “I 
will remain here for one minute. Dur- 
ing that time you may do as you 
wish.” 


IF 



Quamodian wasted no more time in 
talk. With Rufe and the huge, slow 
strength of the Reefer, it was no 
problem to get Molly out of the flyer 
and settle her gently on the ground. 
“Are you all right, dear?** Andy 
Quam asked anxiously. “Pm going for 
help.” 

The storm of weeping had passed. 
Her eyes were open and her face 
composed, but the weariness of ages 
was in her eyes. “All right, Andy,” 
she said. “Pm all right anyway, so it 
doesn’t matter.” 

“Don’t talk like that!” 

“All right, Andy,” she repeated 
dully and looked away. 

“You stay here with her,” he or- 
dered the Reefer, who looked resent- 
ful, but shrugged. “Rufe, let’s find 
somebody!” And the man and the 
boy hurried into the Starchurch. 

As they entered the great chamber 
under the blue dome, a gong boomed 
and echoed. Rufe led the way, up a 
helical ramp into the dim vast church. 
The air was alive with the throb of 
many chanting voices, and it was 
sweet with the odor of the fusorian 
Visitants. The five pointed wings of 
the church were filled with rising 
tiers of seats, but every seat was 
empty. The people were kneeling in 
concentric circles on the immense 
floor, beneath the central dome that 
held the imaged suns of Almalik. 

Of the Robot Inspector there was 
no sign. His errand, whatever it was, 
still kept him away. 

“I see Molly’s auftt!” cried Rufe 
eagerly, pointing. “Come this way!” 
But Quamodian hesitated. “Pagan 
ritual” he had called it, but something 
in the air held him, awed, faintly 

ROGUE STAR 


envious, half afraid. He raised his 
eyes to the many-colored splendor of 
the thirteen suns hung beneath the 
space-black inside of the dome: six 
close binaries arranged in three dou- 
ble doubles, one single sun. 

Drinking in the blazing beauty of 
Almalik, breathing the sweetness Qf 
the Visitants, swaying to the melodic 
rhythm of the chanting worshipers, 
Andy Quam felt a sudden glorious 
dawn of utter peace and great joy. 
He wanted to forget himself and the 
waiting, weary girl outside. His only 
desire was to forget himself and to 
be one with Almalik. 

“Preacher!” hissed the boy. “Aren’t 
you coming?” 

Solemn awe held Quamodian. 
“Are — are you sure it’s all right to 
interrupt?” 

“We won’t interrupt. I’ve been here 
before for this, to watch, like. With 
Miss Zaldivar. They don’t mind any- 
body.” 

Shivering with strange elation, 
Quamodian followed the boy out 
across the vast floor and into the cir- 
cles of communicants swaying on 
their knees. The sweetness of the Vis- 
itants made him drowsy; fhe blazing 
suns of Almalik bathed him gently 
in peace. 

But the boy had paused before a 
kneeling man and woman. “Here’s 
her folks, preacher,” he said. “Mr. 
Juan Zaldivar. Mrs. Deirdre Zaldi- 
var.” His thin voice rose sharply. 
“This is Monitor Quamodian.” 

They stopped their chant. Reluc- 
tantly they withdrew their gaze from 
the multiple splendor of Almalik 
and, still swaying on their knees, 
looked incuriously at Andy Quam. 

127 



B oth glowed with youth and health 
and joy. Juan was lean and tall 
and dark, with rich black hair. 
Blonde, blue-eyed and radiant, Deir- 
dre looked even younger and more 
lovely than her niece. 

And both wore the mark of Alma- 
lik, where the migrating fusorian 
colony had entered their bodies. Deir- 
dre’s was on her blooming cheek, 
Juan's on his forehead. The marks 
were tiny irregular star-shapes, their 
edges dissolving into fine branching 
lines. In the dusk of the starlit dome, 
the marks glowed softly, warmly 
golden. 

“It’s about Molly,” Quamodian 
whispered, hardly daring to break the 
spell. “She’s outside. She’s hurt.” In- 
congruous things to say in this sacred 
peace! He felt more an interloper 
than ever, a brute among angels. 

In unison, blonde and black, they 
nodded their heads. Puzzled, Andy 
Quam started to repeat what he had 
said, but Deirdre breathed: “There’s 
no hurt that matters in the bosom of 
the Star. She must join us, and then 
she will find peace.” 

“But she’s hurt! It’s — oh, it’s too 
long to tell you, but she’s in terrible 
danger. We all are!” 

“Not here,” smiled Juan Zaldivar. 
He groped for Deirde’s hand; she was 
already lifting her face to chant again. 
“Bring her within. The Visitants will 
make her whole!” And his dark eyes 
lifted and he joined his wife in the 
chant. 

Rufe bit his lip. “It’s no use, 
preacher,” he said somberly. “They’re 
too happy.” 

Andy Quam looked at him medita- 
tively. It was, after all, not a bad idea 


to bring Molly inside, he thought. Let 
the Visitants enter her body with 
their fusorian healing. She would 
heal; everyone did. Not merely the 
scuffs and bruises of her body, but 
the somber agony of her mind . 

“Preacher,” whispered the boy ap- 
prehensively, staring at him. 

Quamodian caught himself. “Sor- 
ry,” he mumbled, and grabbed the 
boy’s elbow, turned him around, scur- 
ried away. He felt a sudden flood of 
longing that almost stopped him and 
turned him back, but the boy was 
leading him now. He stumbled out of 
the aura of Almalik, down the helical 
ramp, out of the building as the siren 
chant faded behind. 

Quamodian filled his lungs grate- 
fully with cool dry air that held no 
lotus-odor of the Visitants. 

He said sadly, “I wanted to stay. 
I always want to stay .... But it 
isn’t for me, the peace of Almalik 
. .” He hurried down the ramp, 
leaving a vanishing vague regret. 

His flyer was gone, but the huge 
form of the Reefer stood solidly over 
the reclining body of Molly Zaldivar. 
Now the night air felt suddenly chill, 
and Andy Quam shivered. “What can 
we do now?” he muttered, half to 
himself. “What can we do for Molly 
Zaldivar?” 

“My house, preacher,” said the 
boy, Rufe. “It’s only down the square, 
there. My folks will take her in. I 
think,” he added, sounding worried. 
Andy Quam glanced at him sharply, 
but did not question him. 

However, there was no one at 
home in the house to which the boy 
led them. The door was unlatched. 
Lights were on. The little cottage’s 


128 


IF 



autonomic living systems were purr- 
ing away, a cheery fire in the hearth, 
a pleasantly scented breath of air car- 
rying the gentle warmth to every 
room. But no one was there. “Never 
mind,** sighed the boy, as though he 
had expected it. “I expect what Miss 
Zaldivar mostly needs is a little rest 
right now. Why don’t you take her 
in that room, preacher? And 1*11 see if 
I can stir up a little food; you must 
be hungry/* 

F ed, warmed, almost relaxed, Andy 
Quam sat in the cheerful living 
room. The boy lay on the floor be- 
fore the fire, his chin in his hands, 
stretching out now and then for an- 
other piece of fruit or a last crumb 
of the sandwiches he had produced 
for them. And the Reefer leaned at 
his ease against the fireplace, answer- 
ing Quamodian’s questions. 

They had begun like a prosecuting 
attorney and a criminal; but the Reef- 
er would not accept the role. Defiant, 
uncaring, mildly contemptuous of 
everything around him, the Reefer 
rumbled: “I’ll not take the responsi- 
bility. Monitor Quamodian. What 
happens on my land is my business, 
and those hills are mine.” 

“Creating rogue life is everyone’s 
business,” cried Quamodian. 

“But that was not my doing,” the 
big man declared. His scarred face 
was angry. “Miss Zaldivar is a lovely 
child. I meant no harm for her. But 
she had no business trespassing.” 
“What about Cliff Hawk?” 

Under the ragged beard, his mouth 
set hard. “I brought him back from 
the Reefs. He was almost a son to 
me — but I take no blame for what 


he has done. Except that I let him go 
to school, but that wasn’t my inten- 
tion. I wanted him to be another 
hunter, like me. When he was grown, 
I planned to take him back to the 
Reefs, find a cub sleeth for him, let 
him do as I did. But he had to cross 
the creek. He went to Starday school. 
He got queer ideas from the robots 
and the Visitants. Finally he had to 
go away to space to learn to be what 
you call a transcience engineer . .” 
"“There was nothing wrong with 
that,” declared Quamodian. “I was 
at the same school. He was a decent 
human being then.” 

The Reefer shrugged; then, flinch- 
ing, touched his arm where it was 
bandaged. “No matter,” he rumbled 
moodily. “He’s paid for it now. He’s 
dead. Or so I think.” 

“What do you mean you think?” 
demanded Quamodian. “Is he dead 
or isn’t he?” 

The Reefer’s deep-set eyes peered 
at him from under the bushy yellow 
brows. “He wasn’t breathing,” he said 
shortly. “Does that answer your ques- 
tion?” 

“Doesn’t it?” 

The Reefer said helplessly, “I don’t 
know, Monitor, and that’s the truth. 
Oh, Cliff was in bad shape, all right. 
I didn’t give him much chance of 
lasting more than an hour — less, be- 
cause we couldn’t move him and the 
fire was coming close. But — ” 

He hesitated. “Boy,” he growled, 
“have you got anything to drink in 
this place?” 

“Just milk. Or water. Or maybe I 
could make a cup of tea — ” 

The Reefer pursed his lips, shook 
his head gloomily. 


ROGUE STAR

“Go on!” ordered Quamodian. 

The Reefer half closed his eyes. 
“Cliff had been at work in his tran- 
science lab,” he droned, apparently 
bored with the subject. “I knew what 
he was doing was dangerous, but he’s 
a man grown now. Was. I didn’t want 
to interfere. Then something happen- 
ed.” 

The Reefer shifted position, 
thoughtfully scratched his bushy yel- 
low head. The thick fingers raked 
through the blond tangles like gang- 
plows through soil, methodically, 
deeply, mechanically. He said, “It 
was an explosion. Down below, in 
the old cryomagnetic and radiation 
galleries that used to be part of the 
Plan of Man’s military installations. 
Things the Visitants had failed to de- 
stroy. That was the part that I knew 
was dangerous .... Then, while we 
were putting ourselves together, Mol- 
ly Zaldivar showed up, crying and 
threatening Cliff; she’d been scared 
by my sleeth, so I guess she wasn’t 
accountable. But that was just the be- . 
ginning. There was a real blowup 
then. Don’t know where. Something 
winged me — a stray piece of metal, 

I guess, and I was knocked out for a 
while.” 

“I was watching from Wisdom 
Creek,” said Quamodian. “I saw a 
bolt of plasma strike from the sun, 
then two more. Is that what it was?” 

“I guess.” The Reefer scratched 
again stolidly. “Then I heard Cliff 
and the girl inside. I went to get 
them. Tried to call my sleeth, but 
the creature was spooked, acted fun- 
ny, didn’t respond. It never did that 
before .... But there it was, inside 
the tunnel, trying to get Cliff uncov- 


ered. Only it was too late. He was 
dying. Then — ” 

The Reefer stood up straighter and 
stopped scratching. A look of real 
humanity came into his eyes as He 
said bleakly, “Cliff looked up at me. 
He said something — couldn’t hear 
what, exactly. It didn’t make sense. 
And he just stopped breathing.” 

The Reefer turned away, began 
roaming around the little room. “I 
don’t mean he just died then, Moni- 
tor. I’ve seen men die; they make a 
little more fuss about it than that. But 
he just stopped. Like he was turned 
off. And I made sure he was dead, 
and then I grabbed Molly Zaldivar 
and got out of there. ’Bout an Hour 
later, you showed up. That’s it . .” 

“Not quite,” said Andy Quam 
sharply. “What was it that Cliff said 
before he died?” 

The Reefer stopped, stared angrily 
at him. “Doesn’t matter! It didn’t 
make sense, anyway.” 

“What was it?” 

The Reefer growled wordlessly. 
The thick fingers plowed into the 
scalp again, raked it furiously. Then 
he dropped his hand and said, “Oh, 
if you must know — It was some- 
thing like, T made it — now it wants 
me.’ ” 

Quam abruptly shivered, as though 
a cold blast had found the back of 
his neck. “What does it mean?” he 
demanded. 

“Nothing! Nothing at all, Monitor! 
Or anyway — ” the Reefer looked 
away — “nothing that I understand. 
‘I made it — now it wants me.’ Does 
it mean anything to you?” 

Quamodian paused before answer- 
ing. “I hope not,” he whispered.

IF 



T he rogue was no longer an infant. 

Neither was it full grown — call 
it a youth, becoming steadily larger, 
in each moment finding itself strong- 
er and more skilled than in the mo- 
ment before, feeding upon everything 
around it that offered energy or mass 
or patterns to be assimilated. 

It had now assimilated a very large 
number of patterns, sipping at the as- 
sorted radiances that surrounded it, 
and in the process discovering that 
some were far — “tastier”? — than 
others. Engorging the identity that 
had once been Cliff Hawk had been 
a transcendentally new experience for 
it, and now it found itself equipped 
with a thousand thousand new habit 
patterns, constructs of thought, pro- 
grammatic drives. They no longer had 
any relationship to the hundred kilo- 
grams of carbon compounds that had 
been Cliff Hawk’s physical body, for 
that was now an irrelevant blob of 
spoiled reactions. Hawk’s “personal- 
ity,” even, was gone — nothing now 
remained in the universe that thought 
his thoughts, remembered his experi- 
ences, could recite his opinions. But 
something about his motives and de- 
sires remained as a moment of thrust 
inside the behavior of the young 
rogue, shaping the vector result that 
was its behavior. It was no longer 
entirely random. In some degree it 
had become polarized. 

What were the other moments of 
force that played a part in the be- 
havior of the infant rogue? Its own 
growing knowledge and skills. Its dis- 
coveries about the world it lived in. 
Its innate drive toward growth and 
mastery. Move. Grow. Eat , it had 
thought, as soon as it could think at 


all; but now, with the powerful dis- 
cipline of Cliff Hawk’s trained mind 
permeating its being, it thought more 
clearly and articulately; it had discov- 
ered the convenience of formulating 
its objectives in language. 

I am small but I am growing , 
thought the maturing rogue star that 
had been born on earth. There are 
other beings which are large but do 
not grow. 1 can be more powerful 
than they . 

And already it had implemented its 
strength with a dozen organized mass- 
es of matter. The sleeth was its mind- 
linked tool, now; it watched with the 
rogue’s eyes, would act under the 
rogue’s wishes. Tiny crawling and 
flying things, in the mountain, under 
the mountain and in the air over it, 
had all become a part of its extended 
being. And it had recruited something 
else. 

For the Robot Inspector had chal- 
lenged the curiosity of the rogue. It 
had not been difficult at all for the 
rogue to swallow it whole, to incor- 
porate the mind-analogue of the ma- 
chine into its own consciousness. The 
robot still looked as it had, torpedo- 
shaped metal body and glowing plas- 
ma panel and all; but it was no longer 
its links with the super-computers on 
the planets of the stars of Almalik 
that gave it its categorical impera- 
tives, but the needs and intentions of 
the stripped electron plasma that had 
exploded under the hill. 

The rogue toyed with and puzzled 
over, but did not yet understand, that 
complex linkage of transflection fields 
which united this new part of its self 
with distant and more powerful be- 
ings. They did not matter at the mo- 


ROGUE STAR 


131 



merit. The distant entities were not 
powerful enough to resurne control 
against the near and mighty presence 
of the rogue. And it had other con- 
sideration s to occupy it. 

One was a part of its heritage from 
the dying mind of Cliff Hawk. Over 
that too the rogue puzzled, without 
comprehension. 

Why was it that it felt so attracted, 
so drawn to, so conscious of the pres- 
ence of that small and unimportant 
organized mass of thought-radiant 
matter that Cliff Hawk’s mind had 
identified as “Molly Zaldivar”? 

Through the blind, transflex eyes 
of the sleeth riding high over the cot- 
tage where Molly Zaldivar lay sleep- 
ing, the mind of the rogue stared 
down. Molly Zaldivar, it thought, 
what do I want with you? 

And inside the house Molly started 
up from sleep and tried to scream. 
Sleep , ordered the rogue; and the girl 
subsided into the catalepsy of terror. 
No one had heard her scream; no one 
was in the house at that moment, and 
she had not been able to be loud 
enough to reach those who were out- 
side on the grass, staring up at the 
sleeth. 

T he boy said, awed, “Mister, that’s 
a wicked-looking beast. You 
sure it won’t hurt us?” 

The Reefer barked a savage laugh. 
“Not any more, boy,” he rumbled. 
“Time was that sleeth would follow 
me like a kitten. Do everything I 
wanted it to, never think of disobey- 
ing — I raised it from a cub, it never 
knew any boss hut me. But now it 
does.” He studied the sleeth thought- 
fully for a moment. As it hung in the 


sky on its shimmering transflection 
fields, the great black creature looked 
like some wingless Pegasus astride the 
air, its dangling claws capable of 
wrenching any carbon-based, air- 
breathing, muscle-powered animal in 
two as readily as a hawk’s talons 
rend fur. “Fine beast,” he said. “But 
not mine any more.” 

Andy Quam said angrily, “Why did 
you bring it here? This sort of animal 
doesn’t belong on a planet!” 

“Why, because it’s mine, Monitor 
Quamodian,” the Reefer said simply. 
“I’m a hunter, and it’s my compan- 
ion. It goes wherever I go. Or used 
to. “Why,” he cried, suddenly en- 
thusiastic, “with that sleeth I col- 
lected the finest specimens of every 
game animal in the solar system! You 
should have seen them. A score of 
fine pyropods. Darkbeasts from out 
past the Reefs, moonbats, creatures 
from the hot deeps of Venus — there 
was nothing in a dozen light-years 
could touch that sleeth as a killer!” 
Andy Quam said in disgust, “You 
talk as though killing were a good 
thing. Violence is evil. The laws of 
Almalik do not permit the destruc- 
tion of life by life!” 

The Reefer’s deep eyes twinkled. 
“And would you never take a life, 
Monitor Quamodian? Not even, say, 
to save Miss Zaldivar?” 

Andy Quam flushed. “We Com- 
panions are exempt from certain of 
Almalik’s laws,” he said stiffly. “We 
even may admit violenee, in some 
situations.” 

“Then help me!” cried the Reefer. 
“I’m going to stalk something new, 
Monitor Quamodian, and you can 
join me in the hunt. I don’t know 

IF 


m 



what it is that’s controlling my sleeth, 
but I’m going to take its pelt to put 
in my collection!” 

“Nonsense,” cried Andy Quam, 
startled. “Why — great Almalik, man 
— I mean, how can you? Qon’t you 
realize that that’s probably" a rogue 
star?” 

The Reefer’s laughter boomed. 
“Scare you, Monitor Quamodian?” 

“No! Or — yes, maybe. I don’t 
think it is unreasonable of a mere 
human being to question his ability to 
deal with a star!” 

The boy, who had been watching 
them silently, turning from face to 
face, coughed and interrupted. 
Changing the subject he said, “Say, 
preacher! What’s the matter with the 
moon?” 

A dozen degrees over the horizon 
the gibbous moon floated, almost in- 
visible, so dark a red it was. It was 
leprously stained and discolored, by 
no means the brilliant white fat cres- 
cent it should have appeared. 

“It’s the sun,” said Andy Quam 
gloomily. “Remember how red and 
angry-looking it was when it set? 
After those sunbolts struck? The 
moon’s just reflecting it ... And 
this man thinks he can destroy the 
thing that did that!” 

“Worth a try, Monitor,” boomed 
the Reefer cheerfully. “Mind if I bor- 
row your flyer, then?” 

“For what?” 

“Why, for the hunt. It’s a bit of a 
walk from here to the hills on foot,” 
the Reefer apologized. “As I don’t 
have the sleeth to take me there any 
more, I’d appreciate the use of your 
flyer. It’s long past Starday now, no 
reason not to use it.” 


Rufe cried out sharply. “Preacher! 
Listen — what’s that sound.” 
Quamodian raised his hand im- 
periously, silencing die Reefer’s boom- 
ing voice. They listened. Then Quern’s 
face twisted. “It’s Molly,” he cried, 
turning to run toward the house. 
“She’s calling my name!” 

B ut when Andy Quam burst 
through the door of the girl’s 
room she was lying wide-awake, look- 
ing at the ceiling. Slowly she lowered 
her eyes to look at him. “Andy,” she 
said. “I should have known you’d 
come. I’ve always been able to rely, 
on you . .” 

Quamodian’s ears burned. “Are 
you all right?” he demanded. “I heard 
you calling — ” 

She sat up on the edge of the bed. 
“All right? I suppose so.” Her face 
was a mask of tragedy for a moment. 
“Poor Cliff,” she whispered. “It’s 
strange, but I thought he was talking 
to me, in my dream. But it wasn’t 
really him — it was something huge 
and strange. A monster.” She shook 
herself. 

Then, gloriously, she smiled. There 
was tragedy under her smile, but it 
was clear to Andy Quam that she was 
making an effort to be cheerful. “I 
dragged you all the way across 
space,” she said. “I’m sorry. I’ve al- 
ways been a trouble to you, Andy 
dear.” 

“Never a trouble,” he said, speak- 
ing from a depth of passion that 
shook him. 

Molly was touched. She reached 
out and patted his arm. “Is there any- 
thing to eat?” she asked, incongru- 
ously. “It’s been a long time!” 


ROGUE STAR 


133 



Rufe was happy to oblige when 
Quamodian relayed the girl’s request 
to him, producing more sandwiches 
and milk, a seemingly inexhaustible 
supply of food. “Won’t your family 
mind your taking us in like this?” 
asked Andy Quam. “We’re eating you 
out of house and home!” 

The boy’s face clouded. “It’s all 
right, preacher,” he said. 

Quamodian frowned at him. “Come 
to think of it,” he said, “where is 
your family? It’s pretty late for them 
to be at the Starchurch .” 

“Oh, they’re not there any more. 
They — They’ve gone away for a 
while.” 

Andy Quam stopped in the middle 
of the humming little kitchen, busy 
generating new supplies of bread and 
milk and meats to replace those the 
hoy had drawn from its programs, 
and said firmly, “You’re hiding some- 
thing, Rufe. Why?” 

“Aw, don’t ask me, preacher. It’s 
just — well, it’s kind of private.” 
But then Molly Zaldivar came out 
of the room, looking remarkably re- 
freshed and restored, and Andy Quam 
let the matter drop. 

For half an hour they were all at 
ease, Molly as friendly and affection- 
ate as ever in the old days at school, 
the boy beside himself with pleasure 
at pleasing Molly, even the Reefer 
almost jolly. The huge man from 
space demanded to know whether 
Quamodian would join him in his 
hunt for the rogue. For a moment, in 
that warm room, it almost seemed 
like a reasonable idea, and Quamo- 
dian let himself think about it — a 
long chase, a view-hallo, the quarry 
at bay .... But it was fantasy. This 


was no beast of the forest but an in- 
imical creature of linked plasmas 
whose hugeness and might were ut- 
terly incomprehensible to humans. To 
hunt it was like setting a snare for a 
supernova. 

Then Andy Quam saw Molly hid- 
ing a yawn and realized with a start 
how utterly exhausted he himself was. 
“Let’s get some sleep,” he ordered, 
and fussed over them all until they 
had sorted themselves out into vari- 
ous rooms. Only then did Quamodian 
let himself sprawl out on the couch 
. in the living room, the door to Mol- 
ly’s room just past his head, ready to 
spring up at any alarm. 

It had been a good many hours, 
and a good many hundreds of thou- 
sands of parsecs, since he had slept. 
When he closed his eyes he was un- 
conscious almost at once and slept 
like the dead. 

W here was the rogue? As well 
try to fix the position of an 
electron in its blurred orbit around a 
nucleus; it was under the hill and in 
it, suffusing the skies around, inhab- 
iting the body of the sleeth that soar- 
ed tirelessly and patiently over the 
house where Molly Zaldivar slept, 
penetrating and entering every hidden 
place within hundreds of miles, and 
reaching out into near space. 

But if its position had no exact 
geographic boundaries, at least there 
were loci of special consequence. It 
did, for example, occupy the great 
animal bulk of the sleeth. It concen- 
trated at least a sizable part of its 
being in the electron cloud that seep- 
ed through the rock and clay of the 
base of the hill. And it found other 


134 


IF 



special areas of interest to toy with it. 

It found, for one, the antique 
handling machine that Cliff Hawk 
had used to help him construct his 
tunnel workshop. It was a minor puz- 
zle to the rogue, but a faintly inter- 
esting one; the machine had obvious 
purpose, and it spent some moments 
working out that purpose and how to 
achieve it. Then, the machine solved, 
it spent a few moments now in what 
can only be called pleasure. Power 
in motors , it thought. My power. Spin 
gears. Drive through rubble. It reach- 
ed out with its metal arms and picked 
up bits of debris — a yellow cylinder 
of helium, the half of a thousand- 
pound armature, bent out of shape 
in the explosions. It threw them about 
recklessly, madly .... 

Then it had had all it could enjoy 
of that particular game and turned 
to another. 

The Robot Inspector was a greater 
puzzle, but a lesser plaything. It was 
of no particular joy to operate, since 
its transflection drives were too simi- 
lar to the sleeth’s, or the rogue’s own, 
to be novel. But the rogue was aware 
that somehow the robot had been 
guided by other influences, far away, 
and that some part of it was still try- 
ing to respond to those influences as 
their message crackled into its re- 
ceptors. They were an irritation to the 
rogue, these repetitious exhortations 
on behalf of the star Almalik; it did 
not like them. 

It had, by now, begun to acquire 
emotion. 

One particular emotion troubled it, 
that inexplicable urging toward Molly 
Zaldivar which it had felt, more and 
more strongly, as Cliff Hawk’s pat- 


terns of thought asserted themselves 
and fitted themselves in to the organ- 
ization of the rogue’s own habit- 
structure. The rogue did not find this 
incongruous. It had no standards by 
which to judge incongruity. But it 
found it troubling. 

There was a solution to things 
which were troubling. It could act on 
the impulse, and see what came of it. 

It could attempt to add Molly Zal- 
divar to itself. 

XI 

C C Tol-ly. Mol-ly Zaaal-di-var . .” 

ivi Molly woke slowly, surfac- 
ing inch by inch from sleep. She was 
unwilling to wake up. Sleeping 
though she was, a part of her mind 
remembered that waking would bring 
back to her in utter, unwanted clar- 
ity: Cliff’s death, the birth of the 
rogue, the terrible danger that the 
man she loved had unloosed on the 
universe. 

“Mol-ly 

But someone was calling her name. 
Resentfully she opened her eyes and 
looked around. 

No one was in the room. It was 
still dark; she had not slept for more 
than an hour or two. 

“Who is it?” she whispered. No 
response. Molly shivered. It was eerie, 
that disembodied voice, unlike any 
she had ever heard. It was impossible 
to dismiss it as the ragged end of a 
dream, half remembered on waking; 
it was real enough. It was even more 
impossible to forget it and go back 
to sleep. 

Molly stood up, threw the robe 
Rufe had found for her over her 


ROGUE STAR 


135 



shoulders, and padded to the door of 
her room. She opened it just a crack. 
There was the living room, and Andy 
Quam asleep on the couch. He stirred 
painfully as she looked at him, grim- 
aced, mumbled some sleep-evoked 
phrase and was still again — all 
without opening his eyes. Poor Andy, 
she thought warmly, and sadly; and 
closed the door without sound. 

Whoever had called her, it was not 
Andy Quam. 

She went to the window, threw 
back the curtains — and gasped in 
terror. 

There it was, hovering just outside 
the double French panes on its shim- 
mering transfTection fields. 

The sleeth! 

The great blind eyes stared emp- 
tily at her, the metal-tipped claws 
caught reflections of cold fire from 
the sinking moon. The shimmering 
field pulsed rapidly, and from the 
pane of glass she caught the faint 
vibration of sound that had called her 
from sleep: “Mol-ly. Come. I . 
want . you.” 

For an instant stark terror flooded 
her, and she half turned to run, to 
shake Andy Quam awake and beg for 
protection against this fantastic mon- 
ster that called her by name. But the 
utter wondrousness of it held her. 
The sleeth could not speak; nothing 
the Reefer had said about it gave it a 
voice. Nor could it have known her 
name, not in any way that she could 
hope to understand. And anyway, the 
slbeth was no longer even an animal 
in its own independent right; it was 
only a captive of the thing that Cliff 
Hawk had made and had been killed 
by. 


She flung open one side of the 
French window. She didn’t know 
why; except that, obviously, if the 
creature intended her harm the flim- 
sy glass and frame could not protect 
her. 

“What — what do you want,” 
she breathed. 

But it only repeated, “Mol-ly. Mol- 
ly, come.” 

The sound came from the glass 
itself, she discovered; somehow the 
creature was vibrating it to form fre- 
quencies that she could hear as words. 
It was even stranger, she thought, 
than if it had suddenly formed lips, 
palate and tongue and spoken to her 
so. 

It was terrifying. Worse than ter- 
rifying; without warning, she was 
filled with a revulsion that she almost 
screamed with the pain of it. 

“No,” she whispered. “No!” 

“Come,” sang the sleeth — or 
whatever it was that controlled the 
sleeth. The huge creature danced pa- 
tiently on its shimmering fields, wait- 
ing for her to accede to its demand. 
“Come,” said the tinny, bodiless voice 
again. “Mol-ly. Come.” 

Insane to be talking to this thing, 
in a perfectly ordinary room, through 
a perfectly normal window! “No l” 
she said strongly. “Go away!” 

Did the thing understand her 
words. She had no way of knowing. 
It merely hung there silently for a 
moment, regarding her with great 
blind eyes. 

Then it moved, slowly and re- 
morselessly, like a Juggernaut It bob- 
bed silently forward, thrusting the 
unopened window out of the way as 
though it were air. An almost sound-

less crack and a faint patter of shat- 
tered glass • on the carpet were the 
only noise it made as it came toward 
her. 

The great, deadly claws reached 

for her. 

Molly drew a breath to scream, 
tried to turn and run .... 

Something bright and murderous 
flashed from those blind eyes. It was 
like an instant anesthetic, like a blow 
from behind that drives out aware- 
ness before the mind quite realizes it 
has been struck. Down went Molly 
Zaldivar into paralysis and dark, stun- 
ned and helpless. She felt herself fall- 
ing, falling, falling .... 

The last thing she remembered was 
those great claws grasping her. In- 
credible, she thought, they don’t 
hurt .... 

And then the world closed in 
around her. 

Q uamodian woke painfully in 
broad daylight that poured in 
the windows on him. He found him- 
self on a couch, with a synthetic copy 
of some animal fur over him for 
warmth, his head throbbing, his bones 
aching. He felt vaguely ill, and for 
a moment he could not recall where 
he was. 

Then he remembered. The enigma 
of the sunbolts. The nightmare of the 
Reefer and the sleeth. The death of 
his friend Cliff Hawk. The birth of 
the rogue — 

He forced himself to sit up and 
look at the world around him. 

Pinned to the arm of the couch 
was a note, scrawled with a photo- 
scriber in a huge, clumsy, juvenile 
handwriting: 


Preacher, I didn't want to wake you. 

I went to tell Miss Zaldivar's folks she's 
all right. Meet you there is you want. 
P.S., I left everybody sleeping because 
I thought you all needed it. Food in the 
kitchen. 

Rufe 

Sleeping they still were, to judge 
from the mighty rasping snores that 
came from the little cubicle Rufe had 
given the Reefer. There was no sound 
at all from Molly’s room. Andy 
Quam hesitated, his hand on the 
door; but there was no sense disturb- 
ing her, and surely nothing could 
have got past him to harm her in the 
night, he thought .... 

He left the house and stepped out 
into the bright morning. 

Bright it was. Yet, thought Andy 
Quam, there was something strange 
about it, and in a moment he realized 
what it was. The colors were wrong. 
There was no cloud in the sky, but 
the air had a lowering quality, as of 
stormclouds. He squinted up at the 
sun and perceived the reason. 

Red, sullen, blotched, the disk of 
the sun still had not recovered from 
whatever had roiled it yesterday. It 
was not the familiar sun of earth, as 
men had portrayed it in a thousand 
books and songs. It was somehow un- 
healthy, somehow ominous. 

He limped across a wide square, 
reviving somewhat as he moved. It 
had been a strenuous day. And a 
worrisome one, he thought, remem- 
bering with wrinkled brow all the 
unanswered problems and unmet 
challenges it had offered. 

Perhaps this new day would clear 
some of them up, he thought — but 
not with much confidence. 

He gave the Starchurch a wide

berth, hailed a passing citizen and 
found himself directed to the home of 
Molly Zaldivar’s parents. It was past 
the Central Municipal Plexus, he dis- 
covered, which fit in well enough 
with his plans; he could use more 
information if he could get it. 

But the Central Municipal Plexus 
did not turn out to be the combina- 
tion library-town hall he had expect- 
ed. 

H e walked across a queerly perfect 
circle of stained and blackened 
cement. It was puzzling, it seemed to 
have no place in this countrified idyll 
of a town. Immediately a recorded 
voice spoke to him: 

“Welcome, guest! You have land- 
ed at Wisdom Creek Historical Mon- 
ument. It is a section of the original 
village of Wisdom Creek, reconstruct- 
ed exactly as it was on the winter day, 
many years ago, when the Visitants 
first arrived.” 

Andy Quam spoke up, addressing 
his remarks to thin air, for there was 
no speaker in sight. “I don’t want a 
'historical tour,” he snapped. “I want 
some information.” 

But there was no response. This 
was a low-grade programmed instruc- 
tor, he realized with irritation. Not 
even homeostatic, merely program- 
med to respond to his mass-sensed 
presence with a recorded lecture. He 
walked through a thick gate — 

And found himself in something 
that, for a startled moment, made 
him think he was in Hell. The air 
stung his eyes. It choked him, with a 
reek of industrial fumes and imper- 
fectly oxidized mineral fuels. Blinking 
and squinting, he made out that he 


was surrounded by grimy rows of 
hideous little brick and wooden huts. 

Far down a street was a human 
figure, faced away from him and mo- 
tionless. Vexed, Andy Quam stamped 
toward it, ignoring the revolting spec- 
tacle around him. 

He approached a squat gray pile of 
concrete on which was etched the 
legend, Plan of Man . A voice from 
the air cried brightly: “Welcome, 
guest. This structure, a part of the 
Central Municipal Plexus Exhibit, 
represents a primitive Tax Office. 
Here each citizen reported to the Plan 
of Man the number of tokens he had 
received for his work in the previous 
sidereal year, whereupon he was forc- 
ed to give up a share of them. Here 
too was the ration office, where he 
received permission to barter what 
tokens he had left for articles of 
clothing and other necessities. Here 
too was the draft office, where young 
men and women were impressed for 
training in the use of crude but ade- 
quate weapons of the time. Here too 
was that most central and fundamen- 
tal institution, the Planning Office, 
where the action of every citizen was 
dictated and reviewed and corrected 
by a primitive central computer. 
Here, guest, was the nerve center of 
the fundamental coercive apparatus 
of the state!” 

Andy Quam trudged grimly on, ig- 
noring the senseless prattle. There 
was entirely too much realism in this 
exhibit for his comfort, he thought 
with distaste. The very air was pol- 
luted with the hydrocarbons and fly- 
ash and photochemicals of primitive 
combustion products. And the man 
he was approaching was queerly 


.140 


IF 



dressed in what must have been the 
costume of the time: a thick fiber 
uniform, a brutally chopped haircut, 
something about his neck which look- 
ed like a massive metal collar, cer- 
tainly too heavy and too tight to be 
comfortable. He stood stark still fac- 
ing the entrance of the building, his 
right arm raised in a motionless sa- 
lute. 

“Excuse me,” called Andy Quam. 
“Can you help me find the home of 
Juan Zaldivar?” 

He caught himself, realizing at once 
that it was only a lifelike dummy. 
Another recording explained cheer- 
fully: 

“The human form you see, guest, 
is the replica of a Risk. So men and 
women of doubtful loyalty to the 
Plan were designated. The iron collar 
worn by each Risk contained an ex- 
plosive decapitation charge, which 
could be detonated instantly by the 
Planning Machine in the event of any 
suspect action.” 

Soberly, stiffly, the figure dropped 
its salute, turned until its mass-sen- 
sors located Andy Quam and halting- 
ly bowed. “Oh, great Almalik!” cried 
Quamodian, exasperated. “All I want 
is directions! How can I reach the 
home of Mr. and Mrs. Zaldivar?” 

Silence, except for the questioning 
hum of a carrier signal. 

“Isn’t anybody listening?” he 
shouted. 

Silence again, then, doubtfully, 
“Guest, you are invited to return to 
the Wisdom Creek Historical Monu- 
ment, which has been restored and 
maintained by the Companions of the 
Star for public information.” 

“I am a Companion of the Star! I 


am Monitor Andreas Quamodian, 
and I insist on your answering my 
questionl” 

Silence once more. “We hope you 
found the exhibits instructive,” sigh- 
ed the recorded voice at last. Its pro- 
gramming clearly was not up to any 
question not pertaining to the exhibits 
themselves. Angrily Quam turned 
away and retraced his steps. 

H alf an hour and many moments 
of lost temper later, he finally 
found Juan Zaldivar at the edge of a 
field, busy adjusting a green-cased 
farm machine. A relaxed and hand- 
some athlete, now alert and free from 
the hypnosis of the Starchurch rev- 
erie, he flashed his white teeth at 
Quamodian with an inquiring smile. 

“I’m concerned about Molly.” 
Quamodian began. 

“So am I!” Zaldivar nodded quick- 
ly. “Her course is dangerous and 
evil. Yet Almalik forbids any com- 
pulsion toward salvation. She must 
make her own mind up to accept the 
Visitants — ” 

“No, not that!” cried Andy Quam. 
“Do you realize she has been very 
nearly killed by what I suspect is a 
rogue star?” 

Juan Zaldivar looked genuinely 
shocked. “How terrible!” he cried. 
“We must do something at once! You 
must tell her that her one protection 
is in Almalik. She can delay no 
longer!” 

“No, no,” groaned Quamodian. 
“Listen to me, Zaldivar! It’s no longer 
a matter of just Molly; it’s the whole 
Companionship of the Stars, the uni- 
verse itself that’s threatened. Have 
you any notion of what a rogue star 


ROGUE STAR 


141 



can do? There, look at the sun!” 

He gestured at the red and swollen 
disk, high in the heavens but looking 
like a stormy dusk. Zaldivar glanced 
at it through squinted eyes, with an 
expression of mild inquiry. “Curious,” 
he said, nodding. 

“More than curious! Deadly! Dan- 
gerous!” 

‘To Molly?” asked Zaldivar, po- 
litely perplexed. “I do not entirely 
follow you, Monitor Quamodian. But 
if you are saying now, as you seemed 
to be denying a moment ago, that 
Molly is in danger, why, yes, I agree. 
She is. So are you. So are all who 
have not accepted the Star, as signi- 
fied by receiving the Visitants into 
their bodies.” 

Andy Quam took a deep breath 
and controlled himself. The Peace of 
Almalik, he reminded himself, was a 
great gift to mankind. Unfortunately 
those who accepted it — though of 
course blessed beyond all other men 
in their health, their joy, their star- 
given peace — were sometimes hard 
to deal with, hard to arouse to needed 
action. But that, of course, was why 
those like himself, the Monitors and 
the other free-acting agents of the 
Star, could not accept the Visitants. 
He should have known all that; he 
should have learned to accept it ... 

He said, keeping his temper, “Juan 
Zaldivar, I ask you to do something 
for me in the name of Almalik. Since 
you are in contact with the sentient 
stars by means of the Visitants, I 
want you to pass on to them my 
warning about the creation of the 
rogue star.” 

“I have done so,” said Zaldivar. 
“Almalik knows all that I know.” 


“Good,” sighed Andy Quam. He 
felt a brief relief, a sense of awe at 
the fleeting vision of all the wisdom 
and power of the multiple citizen 
Cygnus, the minds of numberless sen- 
tient suns and transcience robots and 
perfected men knitted together by the 
fusorian Visitants. “Now,” he said, 
“there’s a puzzle you must help me 
solve. I want to know why that sun- 
bolt struck yesterday. Is Almalik re- 
sponsible?” 

Zaldivar squinted again, then shook 
his head gravely. “No,” he declaimed, 
“the release of the sunbolt was a 
violent action. According to our in- 
formation it destroyed much equip- 
ment and contributed to at least one 
human death. As Almalik is non- 
violent, we are clearly not responsi- 
ble.” 

Quamodian peered at him. “Was it 
the rogue that was responsible?” 

Juan Zaldivar said serenely, “In 
that, Monitor Quamodian, we are not 
concerned. We will not resist.” 

“But you’re in danger! Even the 
sentient stars are in danger, if an in- 
tellectic creature hostile to them is 
loose in this galaxy!” 

“We will not resist,” repeated Juan 
Zaldivar. “Acting in violence, we 
should destroy ourselves.” And, gen- 
tly murmuring an apology, he return- 
ed to adjust his farm machine. 

T he boy’s message had said he 
would be at the Zaldivar’s home, 
but he was not in sight. No one, was; 
the dwelling door stood open, but no 
one answered Andy Quam’s call. 

There was a crooning, placid, mu- 
sical drone coming from somewhere 
above. Quamodian followed the 


142 


IF 



sound, and doors opened before him 
as the homeostatic dwelling invited 
him in, up a moving slideramp, to a 
roof garden. 

There sat Deirdre Zaldivar, greeting 
the morning by playing at an instru- 
ment which transformed her emotions 
into art, spinning them into melodi- 
ous sound, colored form, subtle scent. 
She greeted him, smiling. Youthful 
as Molly, her beauty unmarred by the 
golden star that blazed on her cheek, 
she was absorbed in her art and re- 
luctant to be disturbed. 

“Rufe? Oh, yes, Monitor Quamo- 
dian. I know Rufe. But he’s not 
here.” 

“That’s odd, Mrs. Zaldivar,” Andy 
Quam frowned. “He said he’d meet 
me here. Did he say anything?” 
Deirdre Zaldivar plucked a strum- 
ming chord of sound negligently, 
watched a pinkish bubble of color 
grow, turn rose, then red, then dark- 
en into invisibility. “Why, no, Moni- 
tor Quamodian. We haven’t heard 
from Rufe, have we?” 

She looked inquiringly past Andy 
Quam. Disconcerted, he turned, and 
there was the sleek black egg-shape of 
a transcience robot floating over a 
bed of talisman roses. “Robot Inspec- 
tor?” he said uncertainly. “I — I 
didn’t notice you were here.” 

The robot’s pulsing plasma oval 
shimmered brightly. “I am not the 
Robot Inspector. Monitor Quamodi- 
an,” it sang in its high sweet voice. 
“That unit is no longer operational. I 
am its deputy.” 

“Not operational?” 

“It has been disjoined, Monitor 
Quamodian,” hummed the robot 
placidly. “I have, however, access to 


all its memory up to the point at 
which disjunction occurred, so that 
for all practical purposes you may re- 
gard us as the same. Do you wish to 
employ my services?” 

“No,” said Andy Quam. “Or — 
yes. I think so. But I wanted to speak 
to Mrs. Zaldivar first. Molly has been 
injured, but she is now resting peace- 
fully. I think she is all right — but 
in danger, I’m afraid.” 

Deirdre Zaldivar looked politely 
concerned. ‘Too bad,” she said re- 
gretfully. “She is such a dear girl. 
But — ” she shrugged, smiling at the 
deputy robot — “she is not yet a 
member of the Star, of course. Like 
all non-members, she is exposed to 
the hazards of independent exis- 
tence.” She returned to the console of 
her instrument and, with a quick run 
across the keys, built a splendid tower 
of scent and color and sound. 
“When she accepts the Visitants, 
Monitor Quamodian,” she said, 
watching her composition grow and 
drift, “everything will be all right. 
Everything is always all right in the 
Companionship of the Star.” 

A ndy Quam’s exasperation pressure 
was building again. He could 
feel it compressing his brows, grind- 
ing his jaws together. He turned to 
the robot and snapped, “You, then. 
I want some facts. What happened to 
the sun?” 

“In what respect, Monitor Quamo- 
dian?” sang the robot politely. 

“Its appearance — look at it! And 
the plasma bolts it threw at the Earth 
yesterday. Why?” 

“We have no information,” report- 
ed the robot regretfully. 


ROGUE STAR 


143 



"Is it true that the multiple citizen 
Cygnus is not responsible?” 

"Quite true, Monitor Quamodian,” 
agreed the robot, its high voice sound- 
ing disapproving of the question. 
"Aimalik informs us that this fact 
was already reported to you today, 
by Juan Zaldivar. You are aware that 
the citizen Cygnus will engage in no 
violence.” 

"Then, what about the sun? Has 
— ” the thought suddenly erupted in 
his mind, almost choking him — "has 
a rogue intellect been established in 
this star?” 

"The star Sol,” sang the robot, “is 
not a member of the multiple citizen 
Cygnus, nor has it ever entered into 
association with any part of the civ- 
ilized universe. We have no other 
information about its intellectual sta- 
tus.” 

"Its abnormal behavior is danger- 
ous to this planet and to all the 
members of Cygnus on it,” protested 
Andy Quam. "One human being has 
died already. I fear this danger may 
extend to the sentient stars of Cyg- 
nus.” 

"Aimalik is informed,” hummed 
the robot serenely. "The sentient stars 
are not alarmed.” 

"/ am alarmed!” cried Andy Quam. 
"I require your assistance!” 

The robot floated toward him, its 
plasma oval glowing brightly. "That 
is your right, Monitor Quamodian,” 
it conceded sweetly. "As long as 
there is no conflict with the prime 
directives of Aimalik.” 

"Fine!” snapped Andy Quam. "Be- 
gin by informing Aimalik of my con- 
cern. State that I regard it as abso- 
lutely urgent that action be taken!” 


"What action, Monitor Quamo- 
dian?” asked the robot solicitously. 

Quamodian was ready for that. 
"Request Aimalik to suggest alterna- 
tives,” he said briskly. 

"But I have done so, Monitor 
Quamodian,” sang the voice of the 
robot. "We have no action to sug- 
gest!" 

Quamodian glared at it furiously. 
What he might have said next might 
have cost him lasting regret; but he 
never had a chance to say it. From 
down below he heard a high-pitched 
shout, repeated, calling his name. 
"Preacher! Preacher, are you there?” 

Quamodian sprang to the slide- 
ramp, peered down. "Is that you, 
Rufe?” he called. 

The boy appeared, face grimed 
with tears and sobbing. "Oh, preach- 
er!” he groaned. "It’s Miss Zaldivar! 
She’s gone!” 

Quamodian’s blood seemed to turn 
cold in his body; time stopped. 
Gone? Gone where, boy?” 

"I don’t know, preacher. I — I 
think that thing must’ve come and 
taken her away!” 

T he world seemed to turn black 
around Andy Quam. The boy’s 
voice dissipated like smoke, leaving 
a thin and fading wisp of terror be- 
hind it. Quamodian shuddered, shook 
himself, tried to think. But thought 
was beyond him at that moment; he 
had to act. He grasped the handrail 
and started to run down the slide- 
ramp, against its movement, not wait- 
ing for the sensors to detect his pres- 
ence and respond by reversing the 
moyement of the ramp. 

From behind him the voice of the 


144 


IF 



robot, its amplitude raised almost to 
the point of pain, thundered like the 
diapason of a giant organ: “Monitor 
Quamodian, wait! I must ask your 
intention!” 

Quamodian halted, shook himself, 
half turned. “Intention?” he repeated. 
“Why — why, I’m going to get her 
back!” 

“In what way, Monitor Quamo- 
dian?” roared the robot. 

“Why — ” Andy Quam thought, 
then realized he had known the an- 
swer all along. “With the Reefer!” he 
cried. “We’re going to hunt that thing 
down and destroy it!” 

The robot’s voice, volume some- 
what reduced but still an uncomfort- 
able shrill knife-edge in the eardrums, 
trumpeted: “Violence, Monitor 

Quamodian. You are speaking of vio- 
lence. The Companions of Almalik 
cannot support such an expedition!” 

“I can!” cried Andy Quam. “I’m a 
Companion! Our organization exists 
for this very reason — that we aire 
free to do things for the members of 
the multiple citizen Cygnus that they 
are not free to do for themselves.” 

The robot’s black egg floated swift- 
ly toward him. “In the past,” it sang, 
volume reduced almost to normal, 
whining now, “this was true. But it 
is known that certain Companions 
have engaged in undue violence in the 
name of Almalik. This is a serious 
error, Monitor Quamodian! In con- 
sequence the status of the organiza- 
tion has been reviewed. Although cer- 
tain freedoms of information and per- 
suasion will remain to the Compan- 
ions, all use of violence is herefrom 
prohibited.” 

Quamodian jumped back in startle- 


ment, knocking over a crystal orna- 
ment in the shape of a leaping flame; 
it shattered on the floor, and the 
robot licked out a flickering tongue 
of pale plasma to gather up the 
fragments. “That’s impossible!” 
Quamodian gasped. “We have — we 
must have freedom to defend the 
members of the citizen!” 

“We do not resist,” the robot purr- 
ed serenely. “That is the prime ethic 
of the Visitants. The Companions 
may no longer resist in our name.” 
Andy Quam hesitated, glanced 
down at the white, watching face of 
the boy, kicked a shard of crystal 
across the room, then abruptly turn- 
ed and started down the ramp. 

“Monitor Quamodian!” sang the 
robot. “Monitor Quamodian, you 
have been informed!” 

Andy Quam growled wordlessly in 
his throat and continued. The robot 
raised its amplitude deafeningly 
again. “Monitor Quamodian! We de- 
mand to know! What is your inten- 
tion?” 

Andy Quam paused just long 
enough to turn. “What I said!” he 
shouted defiantly. “I’m going to de- 
stroy that thing — with your per- 
mission or without it!” 

XII 

I n the old Plan of Man cave under 
the Reefer’s bill, the hot bright 
cloud of plasma long had dissipated. 
The womb from which the rogue 
star had been born was quiet now, no 
longer fed by the driving energies 
Cliff Hawk had tapped. But the air 
still reeked of ionization and burned 
copper points; the autonomic lighting

system flickered unreliably, and the 
shadows were dark. 

Where the great bulk of the sleeth 
had dropped Molly Zaldivar, the pale 
cloud of stripped electrons that was 
the rogue hung meditatively over her. 
It had sent the sleeth away; Molly 
feared it, and something inside the 
rogue’s stored systems recognized that 
fear. But the girl lay sobbing on the 
cold concrete of the floor, and some 
other “instinct” commanded the ro- 
gue to make her more comfortable. 

Move her. Make her safe , thought 
the rogue, and hunted among its re- 
cently discovered options for a way 
to do it. At length (some dozens of 
picoseconds later) it opted for an- 
other of its toys, the rusty old han- 
dling machine that Hawk had some- 
times employed. It was as easy to 
manipulate as Molly’s old electrocar, 
and slowly and painfully the rogue 
caused it to crunch on its cleated 
tracks toward the cave entrance, to 
come in and approach the recumbent 
girl. 

The operation of the handling ma- 
chine, easy enough in principle, re- 
quired a certain continuity of opera- 
tion to which the rogue was not ac- 
customed; its time-response was creep- 
ingly slow; its progress over the rock 
and rubble of the hillside and cave 
was intolerable. The rogue rested, 
drank mass from the air and strength 
from the stone, then rolled on again. 

The girl scrambled to her hands 
and knees, staring wildly at the clank- 
ing machine. 

The rogue paused and tried again 
its exercises in human language. 
Speaking through the circuits of the 
machine’s radio, it Tasped: “Molly 


Zaldivar. How can I cause you to 
love me?” 

Molly’s eyes widened. “Night- 
mare!” she cried. “Monster! What 
are you?” 

Painfully the rogue modulated the 
radio’s circuits to reply. “Why am I 
... a nightmare? Why do you not 
love me? I . love you, Molly Zal- 
divar!” 

D espairing, the girl rose, tried to 
flee; but she had left it too 
long and it was easy for the rogue to 
reach out with the handling machine’s 
effectors, catch her, draw her back. 
She shrieked. The rogue paused, con- 
sidering. It was difficult to compre- 
hend the processes that affected or- 
ganized matter. Yet the green radi- 
ance that flowed around her was 
suddenly shot with flashes of red 
which the rogue recognized as — not 
“pain,” for it had not been able to 
relate those memories in Cliff Hawk’s 
mind to anything in its own experi- 
ence; but to a malfunction of some 
sort, and it was only a step to realize 
that the malfunction was caused by 
the harsh grasp of the handling ma- 
chine on the girl’s relatively weak 
body. 

The rogue deposited her as gently 
as it could on the floor of its cab, 
and methodically analyzed its find- 
ings. It was a long process, requiring 
more than one microsecond; there 
was much that it had to deduce or 
interpolate. Even its own actions were 
not entirely clear to the rogue; it had 
no well formed referent for the term 
“love,” though it had felt quite 
strongly that it was the proper opera- 
tor to describe its relationship to Mol- 


146 


IP 



ly Zaldivar. Casually and quickly it 
detached a section of itself and en- 
tered into the brain and nervous sys- 
tem of Molly Zaldivar, studying as it 
went, attempting to sort out the dam- 
age that had been done. It seemed 
quite small, the rogue considered; 
only a few hundred thousand cells 
were damaged, and a relatively small 
proportion of them destroyed. It 
made a few adjustments which had 
the effect of stopping the efflux of 
circulatory fluid, rejoining some sep- 
arated vessels and ligaments and, con- 
tented with its work, exited the girl’s 
body and reassembled itself. 

The girl, aware that something was 
happening but unable to know what, 
was very close to hysteria. She fum- 
bled about the floor of the car, pulled 
herself to the seat, hammered feebly 
against the windows; orange terror 
flashed through the radiance that sur- 
rounded her, and the sleeth tried to 
speak to her again: 

“Why do you struggle, Molly Zal- 
divar? Why do you not love me?” 
Molly threw herself back on the 
seat, with a ragged laugh. “Love? 
You can’t love!” 

“I do love, Molly Zaldivar. Why- 
am I a nightmare?” 

She shuddered, forcing herself to 
speak. “Why? Because you don’t have 
a right to exist, monster! You are a 
synthetic intellect. The transflection 
patterns of your mind were created in 
a cloud of plasma by Cliff Hawk and 
the Reefer — ” 

When she spoke of Cliff Hawk a 
golden glow lighted her mind’s radi- 
ance. The rogue said: 

“I am Cliff Hawk.” 

“You?” The girl caught her breath; 


she was shaking all over now, half 
terror, half utter uncomprehending 
bewilderment. “Cliff is dead! I saw 
him die.” 

“Yes. Dead. But I am that of Cliff 
Hawk which survives at all. Cliff 
Hawk is a member of me. And you 
must love me.” 

T he girl abandoned herself to a 
storm of weeping. After some 
thought, the rogue reentered her 
mind, sought for and found certain 
centers it had learned to recognize 
and caused her to go to sleep. It then 
paused and considered what it knew 
about the maintenance of organic 
masses of organized matter. This was, 
in truth, very little; but certain per- 
emptory needs were clear. The girl 
would need protection against the ele- 
ments and a place to rest. She would 
need air for combustion, the rogue 
thought, and observed that this was 
in adequate supply from the ambient 
atmosphere; she would need liquid 
H2O, easily procured nearby. And 
she would also need metabolizable 
chemicals of the class it described by 
the vaguely comprehended label 
“food.” 

All these matters it determined to 
deal with. First it opened the door 
of its cab. Then it sought out and 
reentered the sleeth, hovering half- 
stunned and bewildered over the hill- 
top, and brought it arrowing swiftly 
back into the tunnel. The sleeth’s * 
great body felt supple and powerful 
after the clanking paralytic environ- 
ment of the handling machine; the 
rogue caused it to soar into the mouth 
of the tunnel, hurtle down a straight- 
way, round a curve and join the 


ROGUE STAR 


147 



group. It felt joy in the strength of 
the great muscles, delight in the silent 
power of its transflection fields, pleas- 
ure even in the dreadful radiation that 
it could evoke from the huge blind 
eyes. It lifted the girl’s sleeping body 
in the deadly, gentle claws and traced 
a tightening curve along the tunnel’s 
way, into the mountain and down, 
until it found a pit that it had not 
previously observed. 

The rogue paused, probing the 
dark space at the bottom of the 
pit. It found nothing hostile, nothing 
of organized organic matter. It was, 
in fact, a long-forgotten base of the 
scientific establishment of the Plan 
of Man; the rogue had no notion 
of what that meant, and less interest. 

Careful with Molly, holding her 
cuddled against the great sleek belly 
of the sleeth, it dropped into the 
dark, drifting slowly downward past 
the vertical walls, until it dropped out 
of darkness into a cold, ghostly 
light. They were in a huge sphere 
hollowed in the rock at the base of 
the hill. Once multiplying neutrons 
had flashed through and saturated a 
few kilograms of fissionable metal; 
the nuclear explosion had blossomed 
and shrugged tens of thousands of 
tons of rock away, melting the inner 
shell and holding it suspended, like 
a balloon, for long enough for the 
dome shape to form. As the pressure 
leaked away the plastic rock harden- 
ed, and what was left was this great 
ball-shaped cave. 

The pale light came from all about 
it, especially from a pale cold sun 
of milky mist that hung at the center 
of the hollow. A spiral staircase, 
made of skeletal metal treads and a 


handrail, wound upward inside a 
spidery steel tower, from the bottom 
of the globular cavity’s floor to a 
railed platform half inside that high, 
pale cloud of opal light. 

What was the hollow? 

What was the light? 

The rogue gave those questions no 
consideration. Tenderly it set Molly 
Zaldivar down on the bottom of the 
hollow and allowed her to waken. 

To the extent that the non-human 
intelligence of the rogue was capable 
of satisfaction, it was now pleased 
with what it had done. It had re- 
moved the person of the oddly at- 
tractive organized bit of matter called 
Molly Zaldivar to a place where it 
would not be harmed by outside ac- 
tivities, and where its own attempts 
to establish communication could go 
on without interference. It was a 
place whose chemistry, pressure and 
temperature appeared to be compati- 
ble with life, as far as the rogue was 
able to judge. 

Of course, the rogue was still com- 
paratively young in time, lacking ex- 
perience, and even with the absorbed 
patterns that were all that was left 
of Cliff Hawk embodied in its own 
systems it had no very deep under- 
standing of biological chemistry. 

An attractive feature of the cave, 
for the rogue, | was the presence of 
residual ionizing radiation, coming 
from the surrounding rock, the very 
atmosphere inside the bubble, above 
all from that queerly glowing misty 
cloud of light To the rogue this was 
a welcome source of energy to be 
tapped at need. It did not know that 
to Molly Zaldivar it was a death war- 
rant. 


148 


IF 



W hen the girl woke up she cried 
out, peered wildly around the 
pit, saw the hovering form of the 
sleeth and tried to leap up and run 
away. There was nowhere to run. 
She slipped on the curving stone, 
black-stained and slick with seeping 
water, and lay there for a moment 
sobbing. 

The rogue attempted to form pat- 
terns of sound to communicate with 
her. It was difficult. Even using the 
transflection fields of the sleeth, mod- 
ulating them as rapidly and precise- 
as it could, there was no handy sub- 
stance for it to vibrate; all it could pro- 
duce from the shaking of the metallic 
substance of the nearby tower and 
steps was a harsh metallic scream, 
incomprehensible to Molly. 

The rogue was, for some picosec- 
onds, baffled. Its persona, the sleeth, 
had no vocal chords, no mechanism 
at all for making signals in air. But 
the rogue was more than the sleeth. 

It extended a quick plasma finger 
and probed the tower itself. There, 
rustless and fresh as the day it was 
installed, was a bank of instruments; 
the rogue hunted among them until 
it found one that possessed a flex- 
ible membrane. It spoke through it: 
“Molly Zaldivar. You need hot be 
afraid because I love you.” 

The girl’s involuntary scream echo- 
ed strangely from the high rounded 
walls. The rogue floated patiently 
above her, waiting. 

Trefhbling and unsteady on the 
slick slope, she climbed to her feet 
and stared up at it. With a great ef- 
fort she whispered: “What are you?” 
“Cliff Hawk is a part of me. Call 
me Cliff Hawk.” 


“I can’t! What sort of monster are 
you?” 

“Monster?” The rogue examined 
the term carefully, without compre- 
hension. It activated the distant tinny 
speaker to say: “I am your lover, 
Molly Zaldivar.” 

The girl’s face wrinkled strangely,' 
but Molly had herself under control' 
now. She smiled, a cold, white and 
terrible smile, ghastly in that shadow- 
less light. “My lover!” she croonCd. 
She paused in thought. “I amJlucky,” 
she said bravely. “What girl ever had 
so mighty a lover?” 

The rogue could not recognize 
near-hysteria. It was puzzlingly aware 
that the radiance from the organized 
matter called Molly Zaldivar was not 
the gentle, warming glow of rose or 
pearl that it had wanted to evoke; but 
it knew far too little of human beings 
to comprehend what Molly was trying 
to do. In its sleeth body it dropped 
gently toward her, meeting her as 
she rose, and allowed her quivering 
fingers to stroke the fine, dense fur. 

“If I love you,” she whispered 
tremulously, “will you help me?” 

Powerful floods of energy thun- 
dered through the rogue, mighty and 
irresistible; it was a species of joy, a 
sort of elation. The rogue allowed its 
sleeth body to drop to Molly’s feet. 

“I’ll give you everything,” it swore 
through the distant tinny speaker. 

The girl was trembling violently, 
but allowed the vast black talons to 
draw her quivering body against the 
fur. The rogue sensed her terror and 
tried to reassure her. “We are safe 
here, Molly Zaldivar. No enemy can 
reach us.” 

Her fear did not abate. “1/ fell in 


ROGUE STAR 


149 



the water,” she whispered. “I’m damp 
And cold. ...” 

The rogue made the sleeth’s fur 
warm for her; but still she was afraid. 

“I’m a human being,” she whim- 
pered. “I’ll be hungry. TTiirsty. I must 
have food or I’ll die!” 

From above then the tinny rattle 
of the overtaxed speaker shouted: 
“I’ll bring all things you need. But we 
must stay here, where we are 
safe ” 

The rogue arranged the pit for her 
comfort, dried the rock with a sear- 
ing beam from the sleeth’s transflec- 
tion fields, dragged down a cushion 
from the tower to make her a rest- 
ing place. It put her shivering body 
on it and reached into her mind to 
erase her haunting terror. 

Presently she slept. 

T he rogue went foraying in the 
body of the sleeth. It rose to the 
top of the pit, squeezed its way 
through the long passages, climbed 
into the night. It needed only mo- 
ments to arrow the score of miles to 
the nearest human dwelling. It drop- 
ped out of the dark onto the little 
house, crushed a four-legged crea- 
ture that barked and howled at it, 
ripped through a wall and seized a 
refrigerated box filled with human 
food. 

The little box in its talons, it drop- 
ped again into the side of the moun- 
tain and paused to consider. 

Molly Zaldivar had been in an ag- 
ony of terror; that much it realized. 
Why? The rogue, which shared with 
all intellects the homomorphic trait 
of considering itself the proper ma- 
trix on which all other creatures 


should be modeled, could not believe 
that it was its own self which fright- 
ened her; no doubt it was its proxy, 
the sleeth. From the dim stirrings of 
Cliff Hawk’s mind it realized that 
those great blind eyes, those venge- 
ful talons were likely to be frighten- 
ing to smaller creatures. It determined 
to leave the sleeth and visit her in an- 
other form. 

Under the lip of the cave, where 
the rogue had abandoned it, the hulk 
of the robot lay tossed aside. The 
rogue entered into it, flexed its tran- 
science fields, lifted it into space and 
in it, bearing the refrigerated box of 
food, retraced the long winding route, 
sank down through the frozen light 
of that misty opal sun. 

Molly was awake. 

The rogue, wearing the egg-shaped 
body of the robot, brought itself up 
sharply and hung there just out of 
sight, the food box dangling from 
its effectors. Molly was no longer 
stretched out asleep on the cushions it 
had brought for her. She was in the 
spidery metal tower, crouched be- 
fore the bright, ancient control panel,, 
fumbling frantically with the radio. 
The rogue listened through the ears of 
the robot: 

“Calling Monitor Quamodian!” 
the girl whimpered. “Oh, please! 
And^! Anyone!” 

The rogue knew that the radio was 
dead; it hung there, letting her speak. 

“Molly Zaldivar calling Monitor 
Quamodian! Andy, please listen. I’m 
trapped in a cave. That thing — the 
rogue star, whatever it is — has me 
trapped here, because it says ... it 
says it loves me! And it won’t let me 
go.” 


150 


IF 



Her head fell forward, her hand 
still on the useless switch of the ra- 
dio. She sobbed. “Oh, please help me. 
It’s a hateful, horrible thing — a 
monster. ... I — I tried to deceive 
it, to make it let me go by pretending 
to — to like it. But it won’t. ...” 
The rogue in the persona of the 
broken transcience robot, sank slowly 
toward her, burdened with the box 
of food that it had brought for her. 
It was struggling in its complex mind 
with concepts for which it had no 
names, and little understanding. Be- 
trayal . 

Anger. Revenge. 

XIII 

T he Reefer’s deepset eyes glowed 
like a . robot’s plasma patch. 
“Make this thing move, Quamodian!” 
he roared. “I want that critter for 
my trophy room!” 

Andy Quam hissed in annoyance, 
“Be still, Reefer! I’m not interested in 
your game collection. It’s Molly Zal- 
divar’s life that concerns me.” He 
bent to the panel of his flyer. He was 
indeed making it move, as fast as he 
could, cutting out the autonomic pilot 
circuits and racing the craft along on 
manual override. It was a flimsy 
enough bolt to hurl at a creature that 
ranked with stars for majesty and 
might — a simple atmosphere flyer, 
with a few puny transflection beams 
that could be used as weapons. But 
it was all he had. 

They arrowed through the chill 
morning air, along the road toward 
the misty blue ridge. Over the Reef- 
er’s hill a smudge of smoke still 
lifted and wandered away with the 


wind. Quamodian’s eyes were on it 
when his transceiver clicked into life* 
For a moment the speakers hummed 
and crackled, but there was no voice* 
Andy Quam scowled with annoyance 
and leaned to listen. 

“What is it?” growled the Reefer, 
brows knotted under their blond 
tangle of hair. 

“I don’t know,” said Andy Quam. 
“Nothing. Listen.” 

But there was no voice, only the 
questing carrier sounds. For a mo- 
ment Andy Quam thought it might 
have been Molly, and the thought lit 
his mind with a living image of her 
red-glinting hair, her haunting oval 
face, her laughing eyes. But it was 
not her voice that came from the 
speaker. 

Something was trying to talk to 
him. An uncanny voice — slow, 
toneless, laborious. It chilled him with 
alarm. 

“What’s that?” demanded the Reef- 
er again. “Quamodian, what are you 
doing” 

“Be still!” Andy Quam touched the 
dial, trying to bring the sound in 
more clearly. It was not a robot’s 
clipped and penetrating whine. It 
lacked the mechanical precision of an 
automatic translator. The scattered 
sounds he made out were not from 
the universal signal-system of the in- 
tergalactic society. They were Earth- 
English. Yet they were somehow 
alien, monstrously^inhuman. It was 
not a message; it was more like some 
great, tortured soliloquy, a voice that 
rambled on and on, brokenly and 
angrily. The distorted and intermit- 
tent signal had no clear message, but 
it filled Andy Quam with fear. 


ROGUE STAR 


151 




Climbing slightly, he pushed the 
flyer to transsonic speed. The narrow 
black ribbon of road unreeled. High- 
er hills flashed beneath him. A build- 
ing flickered. The leaning smudge of 
smoke was a momentary blur. 

Something crept along the road be- 
low him. 

The Reefer caught Andy Quam’s 
shoulder. “It’s that machine!” he bel- 
lowed. “An old Plan of Man earth- 
mover — the rogue’s using it. Blast 
it, man! Drive him out into the 
open!” 

Quamodian shrugged the great paw 
off his arm and bent to stare down 
at the road. It was huge and clumsy, 
lumbering ponderously toward the 
crest of the ridge on grotesque old 
caterpillar tracks. It waved claw-end- 
ed handling forks around its angular, 
orange-painted cab. 

“Flyer,” ordered Andy Quam, 
“pot that thing for me.” 

There was a faint deep hiss of de- 
parting missiles as, obediently, the 
flyer flung out a burst of landing 
flares at the machine. They were 
not meant as weapons, but they 
would do a weapon’s work. They 
missed, stitching a row of pits across 
the pavement in front of the machine. 

“Sorry, Monitor Quamodian,” the 
flyer apologized mournfully. “I’m not 
really designed for this sort of work.” 

“Get its tracks!” Quamodian or- 
dered. “Use all the flares if you have 
to — stop it!” 

The machine plowed recklessly 
through the shower of flame. Qua- 
modian spun the flyer around, re- 
turned it, passing low over the ma- 
chine; a new spray of flame darted 
out toward it, struck it, and clung. 



The machine slid sidewise, seeming 
to float on that pool of fire, and 
Andy Quam saw a broken track flap 
wildly. 

The machine stopped. At a word, 
the flyer took over automatic control 
and hovered; the two men looked 


down. 

The machine lay, silent and bro- 
ken, on the pitted road, while chok- 
ing fumes rose from the remnants of 
the flares. Andy Quam turned to the 
Reefer and demanded: “I’ve shot it 
up for you. It doesn’t seem to have 
accomplished a thing. Now what?” 
“Now go on!” roared the Reefer. 
“You’ve just killed one of the rogue’s 
tools, we haven’t touched the beast 
itself yet. Go on and dig it out!” 
Quamodian shrugged, was about to 
order the flyer on. 

Then disaster struck. 


T he klaxon hooted. Red signals 
blossomed in holographic solidi- 
ty on the panel. The bubble marker 
circled a flying object, coming low 
and fast from the woods behind. It 
shone with a pale but queerly pain- 
ful greenish radiation. 

“It is the space creature called the 
sleeth, Monitor Quamodian,” report- 
ed the flyer. “Indications are that it 
is under the control of the intellec- 
tic being you seek.” 

The Reefer was briefer and more 
furious: ‘That’s my critter!” he 

howled. “Careful! It can eat up a 
dozen like us any day!” 

“Careful!” growled Andreas Qua- 
modian. “Let your animal be care- 
ful! Flyer, got any flares left?” 
‘Two racks, Monitor Quamodian,” 
the machine reported. 


“Smash that thing with them!” 

The jet leaped away — but, queer- 
ly, the flares failed to detonate. Their 
tracer trails ended in faint red sparks 
near the oncoming object “The 
sleeth’s blanketing them, ” snarled the 
Reefer. “You’ll have to do better 
than that!” 

“Fire what’s left!” shouted Andy 
Quam, and slapped down the manu al 
override, took control of the little 
flyer’s transactor beams. He spun 
them into high, reached out with 
their pale, deadly fingers toward the 
sleeth, which was growing huge be- 
fore him, the second flight of flares 
dimming to darkness just like the 
first. 

A sudden lurch threw him against 
the control panel. “Mal-function, 
Monitor Qua-modian,” the flyer 
jerked out. “Pow-er fail-ure — ” 

The propulsion field was failing 
even as the reaching transflection 
beams were paling and dying. The 
greenish glow of the sleeth brightened 
suddenly; the flyer’s klaxon tried to 
blare, succeeded in rattling a crash 
alert. 

“Hold on!” bawled Quamodian. 
“We’re going to hit — ” 

And they did; they hit hard, the 
emergency shields failing to function, 
hard enough to jolt men like dolls in 
a coconut shy, struck by a thrown 
ball. The sleeth roared over them and 
halted. It was a terrifying sight, horse- 
sized, catlike, tapered muscles bulging 
under the sleek black fur. Blazing 
green, enormous and cold, its eyes 
bulged blindly out at them. 

The Reefer pulled himself together 
and croaked. “They — they can kill 
us, Quamodian. Those eyes!” 


154 


IF 



Quamodian didn’t need the warn- 
ing. There was something in those 
eyes that was reaching into his mind* 
freezing his will, icing his spine and 
muscles. He struggled to make his 
limbs obey him, and reached for the 
little hand weapon he kept under the 
seat of the flyer; but the icy, pene- 
trating numbness had gone too far. 
He touched the gun, almost caught 
it, dropped it and sent it skittering 
across the tipped floor of the flyer; 
and the sleeth hung there, staring 
blindly down through the faint shim- 
mer of its transflection field, just 
touching a fallen tree with one hor- 
rendous claw. 

The great blind eyes seemed sud- 
denly smaller. The frightful currents 
of cold that had drenched Andy 
Quam’s body seemed somehow to re- 
cede. He could not move, he was not 
his own master again; but at least, 
he thought, he was not dying help- 
lessly any more; for some reason the 
creature had halted the poisonous 
flow of radiation that had drained the 
flyer’s power banks and nearly drain- 
ed their lives. 

T he Reefer gasped hoarsely: 
“Knew it! Knew it couldn’t kill 
its master — ” And incredibly, halt- 
ingly that big yellow-haired bear of a 
man was forcing himself to stand 
erect, lurching with agonizing slow- 
ness to the door, dropping to the 
ground and willing himself to stand 
erect again, next to the great sleek 
bulk of the creature from space. 

And the forgotten radio speaker of 
the flyer abruptly rattled harshly 
and spoke: “Go away, Quamodian, I 
give you your life — but go!” It was 


the voice he had heard before, inhu- 
man, unalive, terrifying. Andy Quam 
fell back, finally drained of the last 
of his strength. He saw the great 
talons of the sleeth curve protectingly 
around the Reefer, clasp him and 
hold him; saw the great creature 
surge into the air and away, carrying 
the Reefer as it disappeared with fan- 
tastic speed toward the gap in the 
hills where the faint smudge of smoke 
still hung. 

And then he felt his flyer rock 
slightly, twitch, and then slowly and 
painfully lift itself into the sky. It was 
not at his order that it flew, but its 
destination was not in question. It 
rose to a few hundred feet, turned 
and headed back for the town. 

The hunters had failed. One was 
now himself a captive, being borne at 
transsonic speeds toward the cave 
where the rogue flexed its new pow- 
ers, practiced at its new repertory of 
emotions and grew. One was helplessly 
returning the way he had come. And 
the girl they had tried to rescue was 
farther from Andy Quam’s help than 
the farthest star. 

Of one thing he was sure: He had 
been defeated. His mere human 
strength had not even sufficed to get 
him past the rogue’s puppet, the 
sleeth. He would have no chance 
against the might of the rogue itself. 

XIV 

T he rogue, wearing the borrowed 
body of the robot inspector, sank 
slowly through the cold opal light of 
the great bubble under the earth. The 
refrigerated box of food, held lightly 
in its transflection fields, seemed sud- 


ROGUE STAR 


155 



denly too heavy to carry, and the 
rogue let it drop. 

It crashed to the seep-stained floor 
in a thunder that rolled around the 
cavern, and split open, the little par- 
ticles of human food spilling out. The 
noise startled Molly Zaldivar. She 
looked up at the robot form, her face 
shocked and hollowed in that icy, 
lifeless light. A scream blazed through 
the echoing thunder. 

For a moment, seeing the gleaming 
black egg-shaped body of the robot 
settling toward her, Molly had had 
the wild hope that it was the familiar 
robot inspector from the Starchurch, 
somehow come to rescue her, per- 
haps with Andy Quam right behind. 
But the hope did not last long 
enough even to show in the terror on 
her face. She got up stiffly, abandon- 
ing the useless radio, and climbed 
slowly down the spiral steps toward 
the bottom of the rock bubble. 

The sweet high voice of the robot, 
modulated by the unpracticed mind of 
the rogue, spoke to her: 

“Molly Zaldivar. Why did you 
speak falsely to me?” 

She did not answer. There was a 
pause, while the rogue pondered its 
conflicting impulses. “I will not 
harm you,” it droned at last. “You 
need not be afraid . because I love 
you, Molly Zaldivar.” 

Her face twisted, and she lifted her 
hands to the floating robot. “If you 
love me, won’t you let me go?” she 
cried. 

“Because I love you ... I can nev- 
er let you go.” 

She shouted with all her strength: 
“Then I hate you, monster!” Her 
voice was hoarse and despairing; de- 


spairing, too, was the angry green 
radiance that surrounded her in the 
sight of the rogue, colors and patterns 
that spoke to him of fury. It left her 
standing here and soared away, 
wheeling around the spidery tower. 
Suddenly it felt the^ clothing of the 
robot that it wore confining; it slip- 
ped out, left the robot hanging mind- 
lessly on its transflection fields and, 
once more a nearly invisible cloud 
of stripped electrons, perched on the 
metal rails just below the pale, milky 
mist of light that hung in the center 
of the sphere. 

It spoke to her through the robot: 
“Molly Zaldivar, I am strong and you 
are weak. Your hatred cannot harm 
me. True?” 

She shook her head without words, 
utterly weary. 

“But I will not harm you ... if 
I can avoid it, Molly Zaldivar. We 
will stay here . until you love me.” 

“Then I’ll die here,” she said 
tonelessly. 

The rogue pondered the problem 
for many nanoseconds. It said at last, 
“Then I shall absorb you as you die. 
You will be a member of me, like 
Cliff Hawk.” 

T he girl said, weakly, fearfully 
then with gathering rage: “Oh 
please — you mustn’t! You say you 
love me — heaven knows what you 
mean by that! — but if it means 
anything at all to you, you must let 
me go.” 

“Never, Molly Zaldivar.” 

“You can’t keep me!” 

“I can, Molly Zaldivar. I am 
stronger than you.” 

She shrieked: “But there are things 

IF 


156 



which are stronger! Almalik! Alma- 
Uk is stronger than you. And he will 
find you yet, even hiding here.” 

The rogue searched its memory 
patterns for a referent for the term 
“Almalik.” Almost hesitantly it said, 
“What is ‘Almalik’?” 

“Almalik is the spokesmen star 
for Cygnus. Almalik commands mul- 
titudes — fusorians and men, robots 
and stars. His multitudes will find 
you, here or anywhere. And even if 
you were as strong as Almalik, you 
are all alone while he has legions!” 
The rogue’s plasma rippled in 
thought “I have met Almalik’s ro- 
bot” it said at last “It is now a 
member of me.” 

“One robot! Almalik owns tens of 
thousands.” 

The rogue did not reply. Thought- 
fully it clung to the metallic rail of 
the cryptic old device, studying the 
girl. She was exhausted now, the 
green fire of her fury dying, waiting 
for a move from the rogue. 

To the rogue, painfully learning 
the uses of those human qualities 
called emotions, MoOy Zaldivar was 
a most confusing stimulus. There was 
enough of the residual identity of 
Cliff Hawk in the rogue to give force 
and direction to its feelings about 
Molly; it possessed attitude sets 
which could have been called “pity” 
or “love.” The rogue recognized that 
the girl was small, and weak, and 
mortal and afraid; it even felt some 
sort of impulse to ease her wild ter- 
ror, heal her pain and rage. It simply 
had no effectors capable of the job. 

At the same time k recognized that 
in a sense she represented a threat 
The polarization of the other human, 


Andreas Quamodian, toward her was 
certain to produce an attempt on his 
part to interfere again. The rogue 
did not estimate that the attempt 
would be successful, but it might be 
an annoyance; and it took the pre- 
caution of detaching some parts of 
its attention to invest its creatures 
the sleeth and the handling m ach ine , 
deploying them as scouts between 
Wisdom Creek and the mountains. 

But there were puzzles the rogue 
could not solve. 

T he answers to some of them were 
far from this cave. It detached 
itself from its high iron perch in the 
opal mist and left the girl, watching 
and trembling. 

The rogue sent its awareness out 
into the universe. It sensed the tan- 
gle of dark hills above the bubble- 
cave, stretched, expanded and en- 
compassed cubic miles of space with 
its consciousness. It observed the 
bright anger and fear of the human 
creatures from whom it had stolen 
the box of food, studied the sleep- 
ing presence of Andreas Quamodian, 
observed the deployment of its own 
tools, the sleeth and the machine; 
and it reached farther still. 

It reached out until it grasped the 
roundness of the planet Earth, turn- 
ing between its bare moon and the 
red, swelling sun, the sun that had 
struck at the rogue in those first mo- 
ments of its existence. 

The star was still angry, still roil- 
ed and troubled. The rogue studied it 
carefully, but avoided reaching out to 
it; it had not been harmed by that 
triple bob of energy that had been 
the sun’s riposte, but it did not con-

sider it advisable to provoke another. 

The rogue expanded again, reached 
out its perceptions to the stars. It 
found them to be suns like this sun, 
single, coupled, multiple, burning all 
across the dust and darkness of the 
galaxy — some tinier than Earth’s 
cold moon, some mightier than 
Earth’s sullen sun. Even beyond the 
stars it peered, to find a bleak and 
empty vastness of infinite space and 
cruel cold. Then in the eternal floods 
of blackness it perceived the glowing, 
tiny lights of other galaxies. Ill-form- 
ed and unfearing, the rogue studied 
the numbers and varieties of galaxies 
for a time, then stored them in its 
memory and returned to nearer stars. 

Amalik. 

It was time for the rogue to 
probe into the meaning of the term 
“Almalik.” 

There was no problem in finding 
Almalik; in the captured impulses of 
the robot inspector was a clear under- 
standing of where Almalik lay in 
space, and the rogue turned its at- 
tention there. 

And there was the might of Alma- 
lik, the splendor of his thirteen suns, 
all greater than the small Earth-star 
that had tried to destroy the rogue. It 
counted them, studied their spin, tast- 
ed the energies they hurled into the 
void. Six splendid double stars 
arranged in hierarchically greater 
doubles; one single sun with many 
wheeling planets. The thirteen suns 
radiated many colors in the optical 
bands of energies, but the rogue also 
saw that they shared a common gold- 
en glow of unity. 

And Almalik felt the rogue’s fleet- 
ing touch. 


Hello, little one . 

Almalik did not speak. Least of 
all did he speak in words; but he sent 
a signal which was greeting and wry 
pity at once. The signal was power- 
ful but soundless, serene and slow. 

The rogue listened impassively, 
waiting for more. 

Little one, we have been looking for 
you . The silent voice was mightier 
than thunder, gentle as — what? 
The rogue had only an imperfect an- 
alogy: gentle as love. We have re- 
ceived information about you. You 
have destroyed patterns we cherish. 
You have damaged entities who were 
part of us. Little one, what do you 
wish? 

The rogue considered the question 
for some time. It framed an answer 
with difficulty: Knowledge . Experi- 
ence. And then, after a pause, it add- 
ed, Everything. 

The multiple suns of Almalik 
glowed serenely golden; it was al- 
most like a smile. From behind the 
round Earth, behind the many thou- 
sand stars and dust clouds, the sig- 
nal came: Knowledge you may have. 
Ask a question. 

The rogue asked it at once: Why 
will you destroy me? 

The soundless voice was cool, 
aloof, immeasurably sure. Little one , 
we cannot destroy you or any sentient 
thing. 

Green anger filled the rogue. It 
was a contradiction, Almalik’s state- 
ment opposed to Molly Zaldivar’s. 
It had not known of the existence of 
lies until Molly Zaldivar told it she 
loved it, then showed she did not. 
Now it knew of lies, but little of 
mortal error; the contradiction seem- 


158 


IF 



ed to mean a lie: a lie meant enmity. 
Red hatred froze the rogue. Sudden 
fury shook its plasma violently. 

It dropped from its great, tenuous 
vantage point, contracted to a swirl 
of luminescence, sank back into the 
mountain just as the planet was turn- 
ing that part of its surface to the 
angry rising sun. The splendid suns 
of Almalik were gone. For a while. 

T he rogue floated down to Molly 
Zaldivar. In the high, singing 
voice of the robot it cried: “We are 
leaving this place. Almalik has lied to 
me. I hate him now.” 

She lay spent and shuddering on 


the torn cushions, staring at the 
rogue. It said: 

“I hate Almalik. Almalik thinks 
me small and helpless, and will 
destroy me if he can. But I 
am growing. I will grow still more. 
I will grow until I am mightier than 
Almalik.” 

White and haggard in the dead 
opal light from the ancient cloud, the 
girFs face had no expression. She lay 
hopeless and uncaring, waiting for 
what the rogue had to say. 

“I shall destroy Almalik,” it sang 
in the robot’s clear whine. “Then you 
will love me, Molly Zaldivar. You 
must. Or I will destroy you too.”

ROGUE STAR

Dear Editor: 

Your March editorial is <a ©all-to- 
arms for the old loyal. It evokes 
questions beyond its central target. 
For many years science fiction pro- 
vided a genre for the imaginative, 
sophisticated amateur, be he physi- 
cist, biologist or anthropologist. In 
this perspective a new wave of styl- 
istic experimentation does seem a 
threat. That fresh outlook of the 
talented amateur might be replaced 
by the bag of tricks belonging to the 
less imaginative but more style con- 
scious professional. 

But is this an illusory battle? We 
may be Don Quixotes, you and I. 
Perhaps the grand old days are 
gone. Five years ago I finally put 
science fiction aside — gone were 
the days of the old If magazine; 
the genre had become totally engulf- 
ed by stale gimmickry. If all we 
have are a few rehashed space 
operas there is nothing to be lost 
by experimentation — let competent 
professionals usurp the field from 
tired plot-line permutaters. 

But evidently I am way behind. 
There is the new If. Not quite up to 
par perhaps, yet showing a spark: 
Mr. Redd and perhaps Mr. Kyle. 
Your editorial shows the spirit but 
your magazine does not really back 
you up. Maybe it is the times. To- 
day’s college professor is more ac- 


tive in the world. Perhaps he doesn’t 
have the time to sit back and wonder 
what would happen if ... —

Way, Seattle, Washington.

Dear Editor : 

FANS DOWN UNDER? Well, it 
rather depends on which way you 
think is up, doesn’t it? 

All the same, I enjoyed Lin Car- 
ter’s article on Australian fandom. 
Believe me, nothing anywhere near 
as sensible (or entertaining) has ap- 
peared in the Australian press on 
the subject — and lately we have 
suffered from a rash of journalists 
“discovering” us. 

An excellent article, yes, but just 
a few unfortunate omissions — 
which, with your indulgence, sir, I 
would like to rectify. 

All credit, certainly, to John Foy- 
ster for his major role in the current 
renascence here. Fortunately for us, 
John did not leave for England as 
planned: instead he has become a 
father. 

Captain A. Bertram Chandler is 
not exactly a ship’s officer: he is 
master of the m/v Pateena , which 
plies between Sydney and Hobart 
(and a really nice bloke, too). 

Three people who, in various ways, 
are very much part of the Austra- 
lian sf scene are Lee Harding, Don 


160 


Tuck, and Graham Stone. Lee Hard- 
ing is certainly one of our best 
young writers; over the last seven 
years he has been published steadily 
in England and most European 
countries, and he is currently writ- 
ing story after story of really first- 
class quality. A name to watch. 

Don Tuck is Australia’s solitary 
Hugo winner (though I understand 
a certain local fanzine went close 
to it this year). Don lives on the 
glorious isle of Tasmania (Austra- 
lia is off the coast of Tasmania) 
cund is one of the world's best sf 
bibliographers. Graham Stone, once 
perhaps Australia's best-known fan, 
has now retired from the main- 
stream of fandom, but still runs the 
Australian SF Association, which is 
devoted to bibliography. 

Over Easter 1968 there will be a 
SF Conference in Melbourne, and in 
1969 the Eighth Australian Conven- 
tion. There are moves to organize a 
club in Sydney, and interest seems 
to be increasing everywhere. Some 
are even suggesting a World Con- 
vention here. Stranger things have 
happened ... — John Bangsund, 
Editor, Australian Science Fiction 
Review , 11 Wilson Street, Femtree 
Gully, Victoria 3156, Australia.

Dear Editor: 

Ye gods! I just finished the Feb- 
ruary issue of If and I think I'm 
going to cry. Not that the magazine 
wasn't good, quite the contrary. The 
Petrified World is one of the best 
Sheckley stories I've read, and that 
is saying something. 

Maybe I shouldn't be discouraged 
by people writing letters in praise 
of poor taste, but every now and 
then after spending an enjoyable 
hour-and-a-half on your magazine I 
wonder if I should go on and read 
tiie Hue and Cry. And then I always 


read it, and right in step with the 
title, I “Fume and Cry''. — David 
T. Malone, 815 Long Ridge Road, 

Stamford, Connecticut.

Dear Editor: 

To Arthur C. Clarke's recent 
query on the Wellsian tale, “The 
Anticipator," the readers' response 
was predictably immediate and ac- 
curate. Now I wonder if your audi- 
ence could help me: a fellow sci-fi 
fan has interested me in a novel 
whose title and author neither of us 
knows. 

The book concerns a man of to- 
morrow called Horn, wrongly brand- 
ed a criminal, who traverses the 
Universe in a system of giant tubes 
in hopes of exonerating himself. And 
throughout the tale drifts an exotic 
philosophy, supposedly not of this 
world, but which finally turns out 
to be the reflections of an 8000-year- 
old Oriental! (Or so my friend sez 
— shades of Fu Manchu!) 

Sounds like a cross between 
Rohmer and Brackett but I dunno. 
Can any Iffer identify this story? 

And oh, yes ... let me be the 
millionth person to ask: When are 
we going to get some new Heinlein 
stories? Don't tell me the Master's 
built his new house as a tesseract, 
and an earthquake — no, can't be. 

Also, how about a new Pohl story? 
And I don't mean fashion commen- 
tary! — Rick Norwood, 4300 Fergu- 
son Drive, Ashland, Kentucky 40001. 
• We asked Heinlein that ourselves 
the other week, visiting his new (and 
roughly 80% completed) home in 
California. He smiled blandly and 
answered not. But we continue to 
have hope. For Heinlein, this is. For 
Pohl, not so much hope; that fellow 
keeps pretending, he's too busy edit- 
ing to write, except when he gets 
somebody else to do the work, as in 
Rogue Star. — Editor.

PITY THE POOR READER! 


We've heard the sad story over and over at science-fiction 
meetings. Some reader was right in the middle of one of our 
award-winning serials when his magazine dealer goofed, and 

he missed an issue. Or he found the stand all sold out and 

/ 

never read the novelette every other fan is raving about now. 

Naturally, nobody wants to miss an issue of IF— the magazine 
that won the Hugo as Best in the field at the past two World 
Science Fiction Conventions. And surely nobody will want to 
miss the great stories and brand new features we are already 
scheduling for the future issue of IF. 

We try to make sure there are enough copies for every reader, ^ 

t 

but we can’t guarantee that you won’t miss an issue, un- 
fortunately. 

Only you can do that. And it's really quite simple and will even 
save you money. Just-fill in the coupon below— or if you hate 
to mutilate the magazine, write the information on a sheet of 
plain paper— and mail it today! Then nobody will pity you, 
because you'll be sure of getting every vital issue of IF!
