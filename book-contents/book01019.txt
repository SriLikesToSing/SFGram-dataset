What Strange Powers 

Did The Ancients Possess? 



E VERY important discovery relating 
to mind power, sound thinking 
and cause and effect, as applied to self- 
advancement, was known centuries 
ago, before the masses could read and 
write. 

Much has been written about the wise 
men of old. A popular fallacy has it 
that their secrets of personal power 
and successful living were lost to the 
world. Knowledge of natures laws, 
accumulated through the ages, is 
never lost. At times the great truths 
possessed by the sages were hidden 
from unscrupulous men in high 
places, but never destroyed. 

Why Were Their Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty generations ago, 
less than 1/100 of 1% of the earth's 
people were thought capable of 
receiving basic knowledge about the 
laws of life, for it is an elementary 
truism that knowledge is power and 
that power cannot be entrusted to the 
ignorant and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by 
the general public; nor recognized 
when right within reach. The average 
person absorbs a multitude of details 
about things, but goes through life 
without ever knowing where and how 
to acquire mastery of the fundamentals 
of the inner mind — that mysterious 
silent something which "whispers” to 
you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 
Your habits, accomplishments and 
weaknesses are the effects of causes. 
Your thoughts and actiorfs are gov- 
erned by fundamental laws. Example: 



The law of compensation is as funda- 
mental as the laws of breathing, eat- 
ing and sleeping. All fixed laws of 
nature are as fascinating to study as 
they are vital to understand for success 
in life. 

You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world 
of interesting truths. You can start at 
once to awaken your inner powers of 
self-understanding and self-advance- 
ment. You can learn from one of the 
world's oldest institutions, first 
known in America in 1694. Enjoying 
the high regard of hundredsof leaders, 
thinkers and teachers, the order is 
known as the Rosicrucian Brother- 
hood. Its complete name is the 
"Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae 
Crucis," abbreviated bv the initials 
"AMORC.” The teachings of the 
Order are not sold, for it is not a com- 
mercial organizari >r. nor is it a 
religious sect. It is a n >u -profit frater- 
nity, a brotherhood in the true sense. 
Not for General Distribution 
Sincere men and women, in search ot 
the truth — those who wish to fit in 
with the ways of the world— are 
invited to write for complimentary 
copy of the sealed booklet, "The 
Mastery of Life.” It tells how to con- 
tact the librarian of the archives of 
AMORC for this rare knowledge. 
This booklet is not intended For 
general distribution; nor is it sent 
without request. It is therefore sug- 
gested that vou write for your copy 
to Scribe H.K.M.

SUPERWHAT? 



TF you’ve read enough science 
fiction, a plot instantly comes 
to mind at the mention of Homo 
superior : 

There is a tiny race of mutants 
among us. They are in danger 
because we lesser creatures, en- 
vious or fearful of their vast 
intelligence, will gang up and kill 
them off. 

So the mutants sneak away and 
hole up in the more inaccessible 
parts of this world or some other, 
waiting to gain the numerical 
and technological power to de- 
fend themselves from us — even 
(or sometimes especially) over 
our dead bodies. 

For one reason or another, they 
almost always lose out. This, as 
much as I enjoyed some of the 
better superman stories, always 
struck me as very peccable logic. 

Why should we. members of 
a brutish race, feel a sense of 
tragedy when they are destroyed? 
The fact that we do, even when 
it’s only fictional extermination, 
seems to me to make the notion 
of a monolithic racial hostility 
preposterous. 

If Homo superior can be 
knocked off so readily, it’s not 
a fraction as smart as perfectly 
ordinary people who slip under 
the Iron Curtain, or criminals 
who manage to break out of pri- 



son and escape police cordons. 

Considering the dialogue of 
these superhumans, as reported 
by various authors, this view is 
not at all unlikely. A more ear- 
bending pack of generality- 
spouters would be intolerable to 
imagine. They all sound like 
political commentators, which 
raises a horrifying thought— do 
people like this actually belong 
to the indomitably dull coming 
race? If so, I retroactively cancel 
my sympathy for the victims of 
what I can only call justifiable 
self-defense. 

My own opinion — which won’t 
influence the stories I buy, of 
course — is that Homo superior 
makes sense only to those with 
literary tunnel vision. 

Look: 

Evolution always tends toward 
specialization. Human civiliza- 
tion is an actual, functioning 
ecology, with the difference that 
it is an interdependence within 
a species instead of among 
many. The evolution of man- 
kind in this civilization-ecology 
is in the direction of specializa- 
tion — and the type known as 
Homo superor is only another 
specialization. 

I know that’s a red-flag state- 
ment because it has already got- 
ten me^into a number of argu- 



4 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



merits, but let me give you the 
steps of my reasoning before you 
write a “Dear sir, you cur” letter 
to me. 

A natural ecology must con- 
tain many specializations. 

In a successful ecology, no 
one specialization is more im- 
portant than the others. 

The human equivalent of nat- 
ural specializations is aptitude. 

The concept of Homo super- 
ior is based on the groundless 
belief that intelligence is the 
criterion. 

In a successful civilization- 
ecology, high intelligence is just 
one specialization or aptitude 
among many. 

If I were an extremist, I would 
say that the real races of man- 
kind are the aptitude groups. 
There may be justification for 
such a statement, but I’ll leave 
that for the experts to decide. 
All I can legitimately note is that 
there is a sharp distinction among 
the creative types, the abstract 
reasoners, the mechanically in- 
clined, the physical doers, those 
who are at home with repetitive 
jobs on assembly lines and such, 
teaching, religious or other dedi- 
cation, selling, outdoor workers, 
and so forth. 

Homo superior may be jack of 
all trades, like da Vinci — but you 
can’t build a complete ecology 
on jacks of all trades. It wouldn’t 
function if every man could de- 



sign, build, sell, entertain, in- 
struct and tote and haul, and 
did so. 

It wouldn’t be a civilization; 
it would be chaos. 

So my view is that Homo su- 
perior, as described in science 
fiction, is among us — but only as 
another specialization. His con- 
tribution is significant. It is eco- 
logically no more significant, 
however, than the others. 

As for the notion that he is 
a mutant and therefore must hide 
out from us, I think the reason- 
ing is visibly distorted. 

If any mutant had to do so, it 
would be some species other than 
our own. 

Rats, for instance. They are 
immensely intelligent, have a 
genuine society, including the 
division of labor according to 
aptitude . and can gain access 
to our labs and archives. Also, 
if they mutated, we would in- 
tensify our fight against them 
perhaps to the point of dropping 
international antagonisms. Cer- 
tainly they would be an even 
greater threat than fission war- 
fare, for mutated rats could rob 
us into starvation, spread di- 
sease purposefully and combat 
us right in our own homes. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if they 
could build spaceships and flee 
to other planets. 

Maybe they have!

Y dear Hoy: 

I am deeply sorry to 
trouble you again, but, 
Hoy, am I in a jam! Once more, 
it’s not something that I did 
wrong, but something I didn’t do 
right — what the Old One is sure 
to wheeze is “a patent dereliction 
of obvious duty.” And since I’m 
positive he’ll be just as confused 
as I, once the prisoners I’m send- 
ing on by slow light -transport

arrive (when he reads the official 
report that I drew up and am 
transmitting with them, I can see 
him dropping an even dozen of 
his jaws), I can only hope that 
this advance message will give 
you enough time to consult the 
best legal minds in Vegan Head- 
quarters and get some sort of 
solution worked out. 

If there’s any kind of solution 
available by the time he reads my 
report, the Old One won’t be 
nearly as angry at my dumping 
the problem on his lap. But I 
have an uneasy, persistent fear 
that Headquarters is going to get 
as snarled up in this one as my 
own office. If it does, the Old One 
is likely to remember what hap- 
pened in Outlying Patrol Office 
1001625 the last time — and then, 
Hoy, you will be short one spore - 
cousin. 

It’s a dirty business all around, 
a real dirty business. I use the 
phrase advisedly. In the sense of 
obscene, if you follow me. 

A S you’ve no doubt suspected 
by now, most of the trouble 
has to do with that damp and ir- 
ritating third planet of Sol, the 
one that many of its inhabitants 
call Earth. Those damned clutter- 
ing bipeds cause me more sleep- 
lessness than any other species in 
my sector. Sufficiently advanced 
technologically to be almost at 
Stage 15 — self-developed inter- 



planetary travel — they are still 
centuries away from the usually 
concurrent Stage 15A — friendly 
contact by the galactic civiliza- 
tion. 

They are, therefore, still in Se- 
cretly Supervised Status, which 
means that I have to maintain a 
staff of about two hundred agents 
on their planet, all encased in 
clumsy and uncomfortable proto- 
plasmic disguises, to prevent them 
from blowing their silly selves up 
before the arrival of their spirit- 
ual millennium. 

On top of everything, their 
solar system only has nine plan- 
ets, which means that my perma- 
nent headquarters office can’t get 
any farther away from Sol than 
the planet they call Pluto, a 
world whose winters are bearable, 
but whose summers are unspeak- 
ably hot. I tell you, Hoy, the life 
of a stellar sergeant isn’t all gloor 
and skubbets, no matter what 
Rear Echelon says. 

In all honesty, though, I should 
admit that the difficulty did not 
originate on Sol III this time. 
Ever since their unexpected and 
uncalled-for development of nu- 
clear fission, which, as you know, 
cost me a promotion, I’ve dou- 
bled the number of undercover 
operatives on the planet and 
given them stern warning to re- 
port the slightest technological 
spurt immediately. I doubt that 
these humans could invent so

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



much as an elementary time- 
machine now, without my know- 
ing of it well in advance. 

No, this time it all started on 
Rugh VI, the world known to 
those who live on it as Gtet. If 
you consult your atlas, Hoy, 
you’ll find Rugh is a fair-sized 
yellow dwarf star on the outskirts 
of the Galaxy, and Gtet an ex- 
tremely insignificant planet which 
has only recently achieved the 
status of Stage 19— primary in- 
terstellar citizenship. 

The Gtetans are a modified 
ameboid race who manufacture a 
fair brand of ashkebac, which 
they export to their neighbors on 
Rugh IX and XII. They are a 
highly individualistic people and 
still experience many frictions liv- 
ing in a centralized society. De- 
spite several centuries of ad- 
vanced civilization, most Gtetans 
look upon the Law as a delightful 
problem in circumvention rather 
than as a way of life. 

An ideal combination with my 
bipeds of Earth, eh? 

TT seems that a certain L’payr 
was one of the worst trouble- 
makers on Gtet. He had com- 
mitted almost every crime and 
broken almost every law. On a 
planet where fully one-fourth of 
the population is regularly under- 
going penal rehabilitation, L’payr 
was still considered something 
quite special. A current Gtetan 



saying, I understand, puts it, 
“You’re like L’payr, fellow — you 
don’t know when to stop!” 

Nonetheless, L’payr had reach- 
ed the point where it was highly 
important that he did stop. He 
had been arrested and convicted 
for a total of 2,342 felonies, just 
one short of the 2,343 felonies 
which, on Gtet, make one a 
habitual criminal and, therefore, 
subject to life imprisonment. He 
made a valiant effort to retire 
from public life and devote him- 
self to contemplation and good 
works, but it was too late. Almost 
against his will, as he insisted to 
me under examination in my 
office, he found his mind turning 
to foul deeds left undone, illegali- 
ties as yet unperpetrated. 

And so one day, quite casually 
— hardly noticing, as it were — he 
committed another major crime. 
But this one was so ineffably 
ugly, involving an offense against 
the moral code as well as civil 
legislation, that the entire com- 
munity turned against L’payr. 

He was caught selling pornog- 
raphy to juvenile Gtetans. 

The indulgence that a celebrity 
may enjoy turned to wrath and 
utter contempt. Even the Gtetan 
Protective Association of Two 
Thousand Time Losers refused to 
raise funds for his bail. As his 
trial approached, it became ob- 
vious to L’payr that he was in for 
it. His only hope lay in flight. 



PARTY OF THE TWO PARTS

He pulled the most spectacular 
coup of his career — he broke out 
of the hermetically sealed vault in 
which he was being guarded 
around the clock (how he did 
this, he consistently refused to tell 
me up to the time of his lamented 
demise or whatever you want to 
call it) and escaped to the space- 
port near the prison. There, he 
managed to steal aboard the pride 
of the Gtetan merchant fleet, a 
newly developed interstellar ship 
equipped with two-throttle hy- 
perspace drive. 

This ship was empty, waiting 
for a crew to take it out on its 
maiden run. 

Somehow, in the few hours at 
his disposal before his escape was 
known, L’payr figured out the 
controls of the craft and managed 
to lift it off Gtet and into hyper- 
space. He had no idea at this time 
that, since the ship was an experi- 
mental model, it was equipped 
with a transmitting device that 
kept the spaceport informed of its 
location. 

Thus, though they lacked the 
facilities to pursue him, the 
Gtetan police always knew ex- 
actly where he was. A few hun- 
dred ameboid vigilantes did start 
after him in old-fashioned, norm- 
al-drive ships, but after a month 
or so of long and fatiguing inter- 
. stellar travel at one -hundredth 
his speed, they gave up and re- 
turned home. 



IT 1 OR his hideout, L’payr wanted 
a primitive and unimportant 
corner of the Galaxy. The region 
around Sol was ideal. He mate- 
rialized out of hyperspace about 
halfway between the third and 
fourth planets. But he did it very 
clumsily (after all, Hoy, the best 
minds of his race are just begin- 
ning to understand the two- 
throttle drive) and lost all of 
his fuel in the process. He barely 
managed to reach Earth and 
come down. 

The landing was effected at 
night and with all drives closed, 
so that no one on the planet saw 
it. Because living conditions on 
Earth are so different from Gtet, 
L’payr knew that his mobility 
would be very limited. His one 
hope was to get help from the 
inhabitants. He had to pick a spot 
where possible contacts would be 
at maximum and yet accidental 
discovery of his ship would be at 
minimum. He chose an empty lot 
in the suburbs of Chicago and 
quickly dug his ship in. 

Meanwhile, the Gtetan police 
communicated with me as the 
local commanding officer of the 
Galactic Patrol. They told me 
where L’payr was hidden and de- 
manded extradition. I pointed out 
that, as yet, I lacked jurisdiction, 
since no crime of an interstellar 
nature had been committed. The 
stealing of the ship had been done 
on his home planet — it had not 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



occurred in deep space. If, how- 
ever, he broke any galactic law 
while he was on Earth, com- 
mitted any breach of the peace, 
no matter how slight . 

“How about that?” the Gtetan 
police asked me over the inter- 
stellar radio. “Earth is on Secret- 
ly Supervised Status, as we un- 
derstand it. It is illegal to expose 
it to superior civilizations. Isn’t 
L’payr landing there in a two- 
throttle hyperspace -drive ship 
enough of a misdemeanor to en- 
title you to pick him up?” 

“Not by itself,” I replied. “The 
ship would have to be seen and 
understood for what it was by a 
resident of the planet. From what 
we here can tell, no such obser- 
vation was made. And so long as 
he stays in hiding, doesn’t tell any 
human about us and refrains 
from adding to the technological 
momentum of Earth, L’payr’s 
galactic citizenship has to be re- 
spected. I have no legal basis for 
an arrest.” 

Well, the Gtetans grumbled 
about what were they paying the 
star tax for, anyway, but they 
saw my point. They warned me, 
though, about L’payr — sooner or 
later his criminal impulses would 
assert themselves. He was in an 
impossible position, they insisted. 
In order to get the fuel necessary 
to leave Earth before his supplies 
ran out, he’d have to commit 
some felony or other — and as 



soon as he did so and was ar- 
rested, they wanted their extra- 
dition request honored. 

“The filthy, evil-minded old 
pervert,” I heard the police chief 
mutter as he clicked off. 

I don’t have to tell you how 
I felt, Hoy. A brilliant, imagina- 
tive ameboid criminal at large on 
a planet as volatile culturally as 
Earth! I notified all our agents in 
North America to be on the alert 
and settled back to wait it out 
with prayerfully knotted ten- 
tacles. 

¥ ’PAYR had listened to most 
of this conversation over his 
own ship’s receiver. Naturally, 
the first thing he did was to re- 
move the directional device which 
had enabled the Gtetan police to 
locate him. Then, as soon as it 
was dark again, he managed, with 
what must have been enormous 
difficulty, to transport himself 
and his little ship to another area 
of the city. He did this, too, with- 
out being observed. 

He made his base in a slum 
tenement neighborhood that had 
been condemned to make way for 
a new housing project and there- 
fore was practically untenanted. 
Then he settled back to consider 
his prdblem. 

Because, Hoy, he had a prob- 
lem. 

He didn’t want to get in any 
trouble with the Patrol, but if 



PARTY OF THE TWO PARTS 



11 



he didn’t get his pseudopods on a 
substantial amount of fuel very 
soon, he’d be a dead ameboid. 
Not only did he need the fuel to 
get off Earth, but the converters 
— which, on this rather primitive 
Gtetan vessel, changed waste 
matter back into usable air and 
food — would be stopping very 
soon if they weren’t stoked up, 
too. 

His time was limited, his re- 
sources almost non-existent. The 
spacesuits with which the ship 
was furnished, while cleverly 
enough constructed and able to 
satisfy the peculiar requirements 
of an entity of constantly fluctu- 
ating format, had not been de- 
signed for so primitive a planet 
as Earth. They would not oper- 
ate too effectively for long pe- 
riods away from the ship. 

He knew that my OP office 
had been apprised of his landing 
and that we were just waiting for 
some infraction of even the most 
obscure minor law. Then we’d 
pounce — and, after the usual dip- 
lomatic formalities, he’d be on 
his way back to Gtet, for a nine- 
throttle Patrol ship could catch 
him easily. It was obvious that 
he couldn’t do as he had original- 
ly planned — make a fast raid on 
some human supply center and 
collect whatever stuff he needed. 

His hope was to make a trade. 
He’d have to find a human with 
whom he could deal and offer 



something that, to this particular 
human in any case, was worth 
the quantity of fuel L’payr’s ship 
needed to take him to a less po- 
liced corner of the Cosmos. But 
almost everything on the ship 
was essential to its functioning. 
And L’payr had to make his trade 
without (1) giving away the ex- 
istence and nature of the galac- 
tic civilization, or (2) providing 
the inhabitants of Earth with any 
technological stimulus. 

L’payr later said that he 
thought about the problem until 
his nucleus was a mass of corru- 
gations. He went over the ship, 
stem to stern, again and again, 
but everything a human might 
consider acceptable was either too 
useful or too revealing. And then, 
just as he was about to give up, 
he found it. 

The materials he needed were 
those with which he had com- 
mitted his last crime! 

A ccording to Gtetan law, 
you see, Hoy, all evidence 
pertaining to a given felony is 
retained by the accused until the 
time of his trial. There are very 
complicated reasons for this, 
among them the Gtetan juridical 
concept that every prisoner is 
known to be guilty until he man- 
ages, with the aid of lies, loop- 
holes and brilliant legalisms, to 
convince a hard-boiled and cyni- 
cal jury of his peers that they 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



should, in spite of their knowl- 
edge to the contrary, declare him 
innocent. Since the burden of 
proof rests with the prisoner, the 
evidence does likewise. And 
L’payr, examining this evidence, 
decided that he was in business. 

What he needed now was a 
customer. Not only someone who 
wanted to buy what he had to 
sell, but a customer who had 
available the fuel he needed. And 
in the neighborhood which was 
now his base of operations, cus- 
tomers of this sort were rare. 

Being Stage 19, the Gtetans 
are capable of the more primi- 
tive forms of telepathy — only at 
extremely short ranges, of course, 
and for relatively brief periods of 
time. So, aware that my secret 
agents had already begun to look 
for him and that, when they 
found him, his freedom of action 
would be even more circumscrib- 
ed, L’payr desperately began to 
comb through the minds of any 
terrestrials within three blocks of 
his hideout. 

Days went by. He scuttled from 
mind to mind like an insect look- 
ing for a hole in a collector’s jar. 
He was forced to shut the ship’s 
converter down to one-half ope- 
ration, then to one-third. Since 
this cut his supply of food cor- 
respondingly, he began to hunger. 
For lack of activity, his con- 
tractile vacuole dwindled to the 
size of a pinpoint. Even his endo- 



plasm lost the turgidity of the 
healthy ameboid and became 
dangerously thin and transparent. 

And then one night, when he 
had about determined to take 
his chances and steal the fuel he 
needed, his thoughts ricocheted 
off the brain of a passerby, came 
back unbelievingly, examined 
further and were ecstatically con- 
vinced. A human who not only 
could supply his needs, but also, 
and more important, might be 
in the market for Gtetan pornog- 
raphy ! 

In other words, Mr. Osborne 
Blatch. 

^TiHIS elderly teacher of ado- 
-*• lescent terrestrials insisted 
throughout all my interrogations 
that, to the best of his knowledge, 
no mental force was used upon 
him. It seems that he lived in a 
new apartment house on the other 
side of the torn-down tenement 
area and customarily walked in 
a wide arc around the rubble be- 
cause of the large number of in- 
ferior and belligerent human 
types which infested the district. 
On this particular night, a teach- 
ers’ meeting at his high school 
having detained him, he was late 
for supper and decided, as he 
had once or twice before, to take 
a short cut. He claims that the 
decision to take a short cut was 
his own. 

Osborne Blatch says that he 



PARTY OF THE TWO PARTS

was striding along jauntily, mak- 
ing believe his umbrella was a 
malacca cane, when he seemed to 
hear a voice. He says that, even 
at first hearing, he used the word 
“seemed” to himself because, 
while the voice definitely had in- 
flection and tone, it was somehow 
completely devoid of volume. 

The voice said, “Hey, bud! 
C’mere!” 

He turned around curiously 
and surveyed the rubble to his 
right. All that was left of the 
building that had once been there 
was the lower half of the front 
entrance. Since everything else 
around it was completely flat, he 
saw no place where a man could 
be standing. 

But as he looked, he heard the 
voice again. It sounded greasily 
conspiratorial and slightly im- 
patient. “C’mere, bud. C’mere/” 

“What — er — what is it, sir?” 
he asked in a cautiously well-bred 
way, moving closer and peering 
in the direction of the voice. The 
bright street light behind him, 
he said, improved his courage as 
did the solid quality of the very 
heavy old-fashioned umbrella he 
was carrying. 

“C’mere. I got somep’n to show 
ya. C’mon!” 

Stepping carefully over loose 
brick and ancient garbage, Mr. 
Blatch came to a small hollow at 
one side of the ruined entrance. 
And filling it was L’payr or, as 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




he seemed at first glance to the 
human, a small, splashy puddle 
of purple liquid. 

I ought -to point out now, Hoy 
— and the affidavits I’m sending 
along will substantiate it — that 
at no time did Mr. Blatch recog- 
nize the viscous garment for a 
spacesuit, nor did he ever see 
the Gtetan ship which L’payr had 
hidden in the rubble behind him 
in its completely tenuous hyper - 
spatial state. 

Though the man, having a 
good imagination and a resilient 
mind, immediately realized that 
the creature before him must be 
extraterrestrial, he lacked overt 
technological evidence to this ef- 
fect, as well as to the nature and 
existence of our specific galactic 
civilization. Thus, here at least, 
there was no punishable violation 
of Interstellar Statute 2,607,193, 
Amendments 126 through 509. 

“What do you have to show 
me?” Mr. Blatch asked courte- 
ously, staring down at the purple 
puddle. “And where, may I ask, 
are you from? Mars? Venus?” 

“Listen, bud, y’know what’s 
good for ya, y’don’t ast such 
questions. Look, I got somep’n for 
ya. Hot stuff. Real hot!” 

T1/|R. BLATCH’S mind, no 
longer fearful of having its 
owner assaulted and robbed by 
the neighborhood tough it had 
originally visualized, spun off to 



PARTY OF THE TWO PARTS 



15 



a relevant memory, years old, of 
a trip abroad. There had been 
that alley in Paris and the ratty 
little Frenchman in a torn 
sweater . 

“What would that be?” he 
asked. 

A pause now, while L’payr ab- 
sorbed new impressions. 

“Ah-h-h,” said the voice from 
the puddle. “I ’ave somezing to 
show M’sieu zat M’sieu weel like 
vairry much. If M’sieu weel come 
a leetle closair?” 

M’sieu, we are to understand, 
came a leetle closair. Then the 
puddle heaved up in the middle, 
reaching out a pseudopod that 
held flat, square objects, and tele- 
pathed hoarsely, “ ’Ere, M’sieu. 
Feelthy peekshures.” 

Although taken more than a 
little aback, Blatch merely rais- 
ed both eyebrows interrogatively 
and said, “Ah? Well, well!” 

He shifted the umbrella to his 
left hand and, taking the pictures 
as they were given to him, one 
at a time, examined each a few 
steps away from L’payr, where 
the light of the street lamp was 
stronger. 

When all the evidence arrives, 
you will be able to see for your- 
self, Hoy, what they were like. 
Cheap prints, calculated to excite 
the grossest ameboid passions. 
The Gtetans, as you may have 
heard, reproduce by simple 
asexual fission, but only in the 



presence of saline solution — so- 
dium chloride is comparatively 
rare on their world. 

The first photograph showed a 
naked ameba, fat and replete with 
food vacuoles, splashing lazily 
and formlessly at the bottom of 
a metal tank in the completely re- 
laxed state that precedes repro- 
ducing. 

The second was like the first, 
except that a trickle of salt water 
had begun down one side of the 
tank and a few pseudopods had 
lifted toward it inquiringly. To 
leave nothing to the imagination, 
a sketch of the sodium chloride 
molecule had been superimposed 
on the upper right corner of the 
photograph. 

In the third picture, the Gtetan 
was ecstatically awash in the 
saline solution, its body distended 
to maximum, dozens of pseudo- 
pods thrust out, throbbing. Most 
of the chromatin had become con- 
centrated in chromosomes about 
the equator of the nucleus. To an 
ameba, this was easily the most 
exciting photograph in the col- 
lection. 

The fourth showed the nucleus 
becoming indented between the 
two sets of sibling chromosomes 
— while, in the fifth, with the 
divisiqn completed and the two 
nuclei at opposite ends of the re- 
producing individual, the entire 
cytoplasmic body had begun to 
undergo constriction about its 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



middle. In the sixth, the two re- 
sultant Gtetans were emerging 
with passion-satisfied languor 
from the tank of salt water. 

A S a measure of L’payr’s de- 
pravity, let me pass on to 
you what the Gtetan police told 
me. Not only was he peddling the 
stuff to ameboid minors, but they 
believed that he had taken the 
photographs himself and that the 
model had been his own brother — 
or should I say sister? His own 
one and only sibling, possibly? 
This case has many, many con- 
fusing aspects. 

Blatch returned the last pic- 
ture to L’payr and said, “Yes, I 
am interested in buying the 
group. How much?” 

The Gtetan named his price in 
terms of the requisite compounds 
available in the chemistry labora- 
tory of the high school where 
Blatch taught. He explained ex- 
actly how he wanted them to be 
prepared and warned Blatch to 
tell nobody of L’payr’s existence. 

“Uzzerwise, when M’sieu gets 
’ere tomorrow night, ze peek- 
shures weel be gone, I weel be 
gone — and M’sieu weel have noz- 
zing to show for his trouble. 
Comprenez?" 

Osborne Blatch seems to have 
had very little trouble in obtain- 
ing and preparing the stuff for 
which L’payr had bargained. He 
said that, by the standards of his 



community, it was a minute 
quantity and extremely inexpen- 
sive. Also, as he had scrupulous- 
ly always done in the past when 
using school supplies for his own 
experiments, he reimbursed the 
laboratory out of his own pocket. 
But he does admit that the photo- 
graphs were only a small part of 
what he hoped to get out of the 
ameboid. He expected, once a 
sound business arrangement had 
been established, to find out from 
which part of the Solar System 
the visitor had come, what his 
world was like and similar mat- 
ters of understandable interest to 
a creature whose civilization is 
in the late phases of Secretly Su- 
pervised Status. 

Once the exchange had been 
effected, however, L’payr tricked 
him. The Gtetan told Blatch to 
return on the next night when, his 
time being more free, they could 
discuss the state of the Universe 
at leisure. And, of course, as soon 
as the Earthman had left with 
the photographs, L’payr jammed 
the fuel into his converters, made 
the necessary sub-nuclear rear- 
rangements in its atomic structure 
and, with the hyperspace -drive 
once more operating under full 
power, took off like a rilg out of 
Gowkuldady. 

As far as we can determine, 
Blatch received the deception 
philosophically. After all, he still 
had the pictures. 



PARTY OF THE TWO PARTS

V^/'HEN my OP office was in- 
** formed that L’payr had left 
Earth in the direction of the 
Hercules Cluster Ml 3, without 
leaving any discernible ripple in 
terrestrial law or technology be- 
hind him, we all relaxed grate- 
fully. The case was removed from 
TOP PRIORORITY — FULL ATTENTION 
BY ALL personnel rating and 
placed in the pending latent ef- 
fects category. 

As is usual, I dropped the mat- 
ter myself and gave full charge of 
the follow-up to my regent and 
representative on Earth, Stellar 
Corporal Pah-Chi-Luh. A tracer 
beam was put on L’payr’s rapidly 
receding ship and I was free to 
devote my attention once more 
to my basic problem — delaying 
the development of interplanetary 
travel until the various human 
societies had matured to the re- 
quisite higher level. 

Thus, six Earth months later, 
when the case broke wide open, 
Pah-Chi-Luh handled it himself 
and didn’t bother me until the 
complications became over- 
whelming. I know this doesn’t ab- 
solve me — I have ultimate re- 
sponsibility for everything that 
transpires in my Outlying Patrol 
District. But between relatives, 
Hoy, I am mentioning these facts 
to show that I was not completely 
clumsy in the situation and that 
a little help from you and the rest 
of the family, when the case 



reaches the Old One in Galactic 
Headquarters, would not merely 
be charity for a one-headed oafish 
cousin. 

As a matter of fact, I and most 
of my office were involved in a 
very complex problem. A Moslem 
mystic, living in Saudi Arabia, 
had attempted to heal the ancient 
schism that exists in his religion 
between the Shiite and Sunnite 
sects, by communing with the de- 
parted spirits of Mohammed’s 
son-in-law, Ali, the patron of the 
first group, and Abu Bekr, the 
Prophet’s father-in-law and foun- 
der of the Sunnite dynasty. The 
object of the mediumistic excur- 
sion was to effect some sort of 
arbitration arrangement in Para- 
dise between the two feuding 
ghosts that would determine who 
should rightfully have been Mo- 
hammed’s successor and the first 
caliph of Mecca. 

Nothing is simple on Earth. 
In the course of this laudable 
probe of the hereafter, the earn- 
est young mystic accidentally 
achieved telepathic contact with 
a Stage 9 civilization of disem- 
bodied intellects on Ganymede, 
the largest satellite of the planet 
Jupiter. Well, you can imagine! 
Tremendous uproar on Gany- 
mede and in Saudi Arabia, pil- 
grims in both place flocking to 
see the individuals on either end 
of the telepathic connection, pe- 
culiar and magnificent miracles 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



being wrought daily. A mess! 

And my office feverishly work- 
ing overtime to keep the whole 
affair simple and religious, trying 
to prevent it from splashing over 
into awareness of the more ra- 
tional beings in each community! 
It’s an axiom of Outlying Patrol 
Offices that nothing will stimu- 
late space travel among backward 
peoples faster than definite 
knowledge of the existence of 
intelligent celestial neighbors. 
Frankly, if Pah-Chi-Luh had 
come to me right then, blathering 
of Gtetan pornography in human 
high-school textbooks, I’d prob- 
ably have bitten his heads off. 

TTE’D discovered the textbooks 
in the course of routine 
duties as an investigator for a 
United States Congressional 
Committee — his disguised status 
for the last decade or so, and one 
which had proved particularly 
valuable in the various delaying 
actions we had been surreptitious- 
ly fighting on the continent of 
North America. There was this 
newly published biology book, 
written for use in' the secondary 
schools, which had received ex- 
tremely favorable comment from 
outstanding scholars in the uni- 
versities. Naturally, the commit- 
tee ordered a copy of the text and 
suggested that its investigator 
look through it. 

Corporal Pah-Chi-Luh turned 



a few pages and found himself 
staring at the very pornographic 
pictures he’d heard about at the 
briefing session six months before 
— published, available to every- 
one on Earth, and especially to 
minors! He told me afterward, 
brokenly, that in that instant all 
he saw was a brazen repetition of 
L’payr’s ugly crime on his home 
planet. 

He blasted out a Galaxy-wide 
alarm for the Gtetan. 

L'payr had begun life anew 
as an ashkebac craftsman on a 
small, out-of-the-way, mildly 
civilized world. Living carefully 
within the law, he had prospered 
and, at the time of his arrest, had 
become sufficiently conventional 
— and, incidentally, fat — to think 
of raising a respectable family. 
Not much — just two of him. If 
things continued to go well, he 
might consider multiple fission in 
the future. 

He was indignant when he was 
arrested and carried off to the 
detention cell on Pluto, pending 
the arrival of an extradition party 
from Gtet. 

“By what right do you disturb 
a peace-loving artisan in the quiet 
pursuit of his trade?” he chal- 
lenged. “I demand immediate un- 
conditional release, a full apology 
and restitution for loss of income 
as well as the embarrassment 
caused my person and ego. Your 
superiors will hear of this! False 



PARTY OF THE TWO PARTS 



19 



arrest of a galactic citizen can be 
a very serious matter!” 

“No doubt,” Stellar Corporal 
Pah-Chi-Luh retorted, still quite 
equable, you see. “But the public 
dissemination of recognized por- 
nography is even more serious. As 
a crime, we consider it on a level 
with — ” 

“What pornography?” 

l^'Y assistant said he stared at 
L’payr for a long time 
through the transparent cell wall, 
marveling at the creature’s ef- 
frontery. All the same, he began 
to feel a certain disquiet. He had 
never before encountered such 
complete self-assurance in the 
face of a perfect structure of 
criminal evidence. 

“You know very well what 
pornography. Here — examine it 
for yourself. This is only one 
copy out of 20,000 distributed all 
over the United States of North 
America for the specific use of 
human adolescents.” He dema- 
terialized the biology text and 
passed it through the wall. 

L’payr glanced at the pictures. 
“Bad reproduction,” he com- 
mented. “Those humans still have 
a long way to go in many re- 
spects. However, they do display 
a pleasing technical precocity. 
But why show this to me? Surely 
you don’t think I have anything 
to do with it?” 

Pah-Chi-Luh says the Gtetan 



seemed intensely puzzled, yet 
gently patient, as if he were try- 
ing to unravel the hysterical gib- 
berings of an idiot child. 

“Do you deny it?” 

“What in the Universe is there 
to deny? Let me see.” He turned 
to the title page. “This seems to 
be A First Book in Biology by 
one Osborne Blatch and one 
Nicodemus P. Smith. You 
haven’t mistaken me for either 
Blatch or Smith, have you? My 
name is L’payr, not Osborne 
L’payr, nor even Nicodemus P. 
L’payr. Just plain, old, everyday, 
simple L’payr. No more, no less. 
I come from Gtet, which is the 
sixth planet of — ” 

“I am fully aware of Gtet’s 
astrographic location,” Pah-Chi- 
Luh informed him coldly. “Also, 
that you were on Earth six of 
their months ago. And that, at 
the time, you completed a trans- 
action with this Osborne Blatch, 
whereby you got the fuel you 
needed to leave the planet, while 
Blatch obtained the set of pictures 
that were later used as illustra- 
tions in that textbook. Our un- 
dercover organization on Earth 
functions very efficiently, as you 
can see. We have labeled the book 
Exhibit A.” 

“An ingenious designation,” 
said the Gtetan admiringly. “Ex- 
hibit A! With so much to choose 
from, you picked the one that 
sounds just right. My compli- 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



merits.” He was, you will un- 
derstand, Hoy, in his element — he 
was dealing with a police official 
on an abstruse legal point. 
L’payr’s entire brilliant criminal 
past on a law-despising world 
had prepared him for this mo- 
ment. Pah-Chi-Luh’s mental ori- 
entation, however, had for a long 
time now been chiefly in the di- 
rection of espionage and sub rosa 
cultural manipulation. He was 
totally unprepared for the orgy 
of judicial quibbles that was 
about to envelop him. In all 
fairness to him, let me admit that 
I might not have done any better 
under those circumstances and 
neither, for that matter, might 
you — nor the Old One himself! 

T ’PAYR pointed out, “All I did 
was to sell a set of artistic 
studies to one Osborne Blatch. 
What he did with it afterward 
surely does not concern me. If I 
sell a weapon of approved tech- 
nological backwardness to an 
Earthman — a flint fist-axe, say, 
or a cauldron for pouring boiling 
oil upon the stormers of walled 
cities — and he uses the weapon to 
dispatch one of his fellow primi- 
tives, am I culpable? Not the way 
I read the existing statutes of the 
Galactic Federation, my friend. 
Now suppose you reimburse me 
for my time and trouble and put 
me on a fast ship bound for my 
place of business?” 



Around and around they went. 
Dozens of times, Pah-Chi-Luh, 
going frantically through the 
Pluto Headquarters law library, 
would come up with a nasty little 
wrinkle of an ordinance, only to 
have L’payr point out that the 
latest interpretation of the Su- 
preme Council put him wholly in 
the clear. I can myself vouch for 
the fact that the Gtetans seem to 
enjoy total recall of all judicial 
history. 

“But you do admit selling por- 
nography yourself to the Earth- 
man Osborne Blatch?” the stel- 
lar corporal bellowed at last. 

“Pornography, pornography,” 
L’payr mused. “That would be 
defined as cheaply exciting lewd- 
ness, falsely titillating obscenity. 
Correct?” 

“Of course!” 

“Well, Corporal, let me ask 
you a question. You saw those 
pictures. Did you find them ex- 
citing or titillating?” 

“Certainly not. But I don’t 
happen to be a Gtetan ameboid.” 
“Neither,” L’payr countered 
quietly, “is Osborne Blatch.” 

I do think Corporal Pah-Chi- 
Luh might have found some sen- 
sible way out of the dilemma if 
the extradition party had not just 
then arrived from Gtet on the 
special Patrol ship which had 
been sent for it. He now found 
himself confronted with six 
more magnificently argumenta- 



PARTY OF THE TWO PARTS 



21 



tive ameboids, numbering among 
them some of the trickiest legal 
minds on the home planet. The 
police of Rugh VI had had many 
intricate dealings with L’payr in 
the Gtetan courts. Hence, they 
took no chances and sent their 
best representatives. 

Outnumbered L’payr may have 
been, but remember, Hoy, he had 
prepared for just these eventual- 
ities ever since leaving Earth. And 
just to stimulate his devious in- 
tellect to maximum performance, 
there was the fact that his was 
the only life at stake. Once let his 
fellow ameboids get their pseudo- 
pods on him again, and he was a 
gone protozoan. 

T>ETWEEN L’payr and the 
Gtetan extradition party, 
Corporal Pah-Chi-Luh began to 
find out how unhappy a police- 
man’s lot can become. Back and 
forth he went, from the prisoner 
to the lawyers, stumbling through 
quagmires of opinion, falling into 
chasms of complexity. 

The extradition group was de- 
termined not to return to their 
planet empty-pseudopoded. In 
order to succeed, they had to 
make the current arrest stick, 
which would give them the right 
— as previously injured parties — 
to assert their prior claim to the 
punishment of L’payr. For his 
part, L’payr was equally deter- 
mined to invalidate the arrest by 



the Patrol, since then he would 
not only have placed our outfit 
in an uncomfortable position, but, 
no longer extraditable, would be 
entitled to its protection from his 
fellow citizens. 

A weary, bleary and excessive- 
ly hoarse Pah-Chi-Luh finally 
dragged himself to the extradi- 
tion party on spindly tentacles 
and informed them that, after 
much careful consideration, he 
had come to the conclusion that 
L’payr was innocent of any crime 
during his stay on Earth. 

“Nonsense,” he was told by the 
spokesman. “A crime was com- 
mitted. Arrant and unquestioned 
pornography was sold and circu- 
lated on that planet. A crime has 
to have been committed.” 

Pah-Chi-Luh went back to 
L’payr and asked, miserably, how 
about it? Didn’t it seem, he al- 
most pleaded, that all the neces- 
sary ingredients of a crime were 
present? Some kind of crime? 

“True,” L’payr said thought- 
fully. “They have a point. Some 
kind of crime may have been 
committed — but not by me. 
Osborne Blatch, now . .” 

Stellar Corporal Pah-Chi-Luh 
completely lost his heads. 

He sent a message to Earth, 
ordering Osborne Blatch to be 
picked up. 

Fortunately for all of us, up to 
and including the Old One, Pah- 
Chi-Luh did not go so far as to 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



have Blatch arrested. The Earth- 
man was merely held as a ma- 
terial witness. When I think what 
the false arrest of a creature from 
a Secretly Supervised world could 
lead to, especially in a case of 
this sort, Hoy, my blood almost 
turns liquid. 

But Pah-Chi-Luh did commit 
the further blunder of incarcerat- 
ing Osborne Blatch in a cell ad- 
joining L’payr’s. Everything, you 
will observe, was working out to 
the ameboid’s satisfaction — in- 
cluding my young assistant. 

T>Y the time Pah-Chi-Luh got 
around to Blatch's first inter- 
rogation, the Earthman had 
already been briefed by his neigh- 
bor. Not that the briefing was 
displayed overmuch — as yet. 

“Pornography?” he repeated in 
answer to the first question. 
“What pornography? Mr. Smith 
and I had been working on an 
elementary biology text for some 
time and we were hoping to use 
new illustrations throughout. We 
wanted larger, clear pictures of 
the sort that would be instantly 
comprehensible to youngsters — 
and we were particularly interest- 
ed in getting away from the 
blurry drawings that have been 
used and re-used in all textbooks, 
almost from the time of Leewen- 
hoek. Mr. L’payr’s series on the 
cycle of ameboid reproduction 
was a godsend. In a sense, they 



made the first section of the 
book.” 

“You don’t deny, however,” 
Corporal Pah-Chi-Luh inquired 
remorselessly, “that, at the time 
of the purchase, you knew those 
pictures were pornographic? And 
that, despite this knowledge, you 
went ahead and used them for the 
delectation of juveniles of your 
race?” 

“Edification,” the elderly hu- 
man schoolteacher corrected him. 
“Edification, not delectation. I 
assure you that not a single stu- 
dent who studied the photographs 
in question — which, by the way, 
appeared textually as drawings — 
received any premature erotic 
stimulation thereby. I will admit 
that, at the time of purchase, I 
did receive a distinct impression 
from the gentleman in the next 
cell that he and his kind consid- 
ered the illustrations rather 
racy — ” 

“Well, then?” 

“But that was his problem, not 
mine. After all, if I buy an arti- 
fact from an extraterrestrial crea- 
ture — a flint fist-axe, say, or a 
cauldron for pouring boiling oil 
upon the stormers of walled cit- 
ies — and I use them both in 
completely peaceful and useful 
pursuits — the former to grub 
onions out of the ground and the 
latter to cook the onions in a 
kind of soup — have I done any- 
thing wrong?

“As a matter of fact, the text- 
book in question received fine 
reviews and outstanding com- 
mendations from educational and 
scientific authorities all over the 
nation. Would you like to hear 
some of them? I believe I may 
have a review or two in my 
pockets. Let me see. Yes, just by 
chance, I seem to have a handful 
of clippings in this suit. Well, 
well! I didn’t know there were 
quite so many. This is what the 
Southern Prairie States Second- 
ary School Gazette has to say — 
‘A substantial and noteworthy 
achievement. It will live long in 
the annals of elementary science 
pedagoguery. The authors may 
well feel . ” 

It was then that Corporal Pah- 
Chi-Luh sent out a despairing 
call for me. 

TJ'ORTUNATELY, I was free 
to give the matter my full 
attention, the Saudi Arabia- 
Ganymede affair being complete- 
ly past the danger point. Had I 
been tied up . 

After experimenting , with all 
kinds of distractions, including 
secret agents disguised as danc- 
ing girls, we had finally managed 
to embroil the young mystic in 
a tremendous theological dispute 
on the exact nature and moral 
consequences of the miracles he 
was wreaking. Outstanding Mo- 
hammedan religious leaders of 

24 GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the region had lined up on one 
side or the other and turned the 
air blue with quotations from the 
Koran and later Sunnite books. 
The mystic was drawn in and 
became so involved in the argu- 
ment that he stopped thinking 
about his original objectives and 
irreparably broke the mental con- 
nection with Ganymede. 

For a while, this left a con- 
tinuing problem on that satellite 
— it looked as if the civilization 
of disembodied intellects might 
eventually come to some approxi- 
mation of the real truth. Luckily 
for us, the entire business had 
been viewed there also as a re- 
ligious phenomenon and, once 
telepathic contact was lost, the 
intellect who had been communi- 
cating with the human, and had 
achieved much prestige thereby, 
was thoroughly discredited. It 
was generally believed that he 
had willfully and deliberately 
faked the entire thing, for the 
purpose of creating skepticism 
among the more spiritual mem- 
bers of his race. An ecclesiastical 
court ordered the unfortunate 
telepath to be embodied alive. 

It was, therefore, with a warm 
feeling of a job well done that I 
returned to my headquarters on 
Pluto in response to Pah-Chi- 
Luh’s summons. 

Needless to say, this feeling 
quickly changed to the most over- 
powering dismay. After getting 




PARTY OF THE TWO PARTS

the background from the over- 
wrought corporal, I interviewed 
the Gtetan extradition force. 
They had been in touch with 
their home office and -were threat- 
ening a major galactic scandal if 
the Patrol’s arrest of L’payr were 
not upheld and L’payr remanded 
to their custody. 

“Are the most sacred and inti- 
mate details of our sex life to 
be shamelessly flaunted from one 
end of the Universe to the other?” 
I was asked angrily. “Pornog- 
raphy is pornography — a crime 
is a crime. The intent was there 
— the overt act was there. We 
demand our prisoner.” 

“How can you have pornog- 
raphy without titillation?” L’payr 
wanted to know. “If a Chumblos- 
tian sells a Gtetan a quantity of 
krrgllwss — which they use as 
food and we use as building ma- 
terial — does the shipment have 
to be paid for under the nutri- 
tive or structural tariffs? The 
structural tariffs obtain, as you 
well know, Sergeant. I demand 
immediate release!” 

T>UT the most unpleasant sur- 
prise of all awaited me with 
Blatch. The terrestrial was sitting 
in his cell, sucking the curved 
handle of his umbrella. 

“Under the code governing the 
treatment of all races on Secretly 
Supervised Status,” he began as 
soon as he saw me, “and I refer 



not only to the Rigellian-Sagit- 
tarian Convention, but to the 
statutes of the third cosmic cycle 
and the Supreme Council deci- 
sions in the cases of Khwomo vs. 
Khwomo and Farziplok vs. An- 
tares XII, I demand return to 
my accustomed habitat on Earth, 
the payment of damages accord- 
ing to the schedule developed by 
the Nobri Commission in the 
latest Vivadin controversy. I also 
demand satisfaction in terms 
of — ” 

“You seem to have acquired a 
good deal of knowledge of inter- 
stellar law,” I commented slowly. 

“Oh, I have. Sergeant — I have. 
Mr. L’payr was most helpful in 
acquainting me with my rights. It 
seems that I am entitled to all 
sorts of recompenses — or, at 
least, that I can claim entitle- 
ment. You have a very interesting 
galactic culture, Sergeant. Many, 
many people on Earth would be 
fascinated to learn about it. But I 
am quite prepared to spare you 
the embarrassment which such 
publicity would cause you. I am 
certain that two reasonable indi- 
viduals like ourselves can come 
to terms.” 

When I charged L’payr with 
violating galactic secrecy, he 
spread his cytoplasm in an elab- 
orate ameboid shrug. 

"/ told him nothing on Earth, 
Sergeant. Whatever information 
this terrestrial has received — and 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I will admit that it would have 
been damaging and highly illegal 
— was entirely in the jurisdiction 
of your headquarters office. Be- 
sides, having been wrongfully ac- 
cused of an ugly and unthinkable 
crime, I surely had the right to 
prepare my defense by discussing 
the matter with the only witness 
to the deed. I might go further 
and point out that, since Mr. 
Blatch and myself are in a sense 
co-defendants, there could be no 
valid objection to a pooling of our 
legal knowledge.” 

Back in my office, I brought 
Corporal Pah-Chi-Luh up to 
date. 

“It’s like a morass,” he com- 
plained. “The more you struggle 
to get out, the deeper you fall in 
it! And this terrestrial! The Plu- 
tonian natives who’ve been 
guarding him have been driven 
almost crazy. He asks questions 
about everything — what’s this, 
what’s that, how does it work. 
Or it’s not hot enough for him, 
the air doesn’t smell right, his 
food is uninteresting. His throat 
has developed an odd tickle, he 
wants a gargle, he needs a — ” 

“Give him everything he wants, 
but within reason,” I said. “If 
this creature dies on us, you and 
I will be lucky to draw no more 
than a punishment tour in the 
Black Hole in Cygnus. But as for 
the rest of it — look here, Cor- 
poral, I find myself in agreement 



with the extradition party from 
Gtet. A crime has to have been 
committed.” - 

OTELLAR Corporal Pah-Chi- 
^ Luh stared at me. "You — you 
mean . 

“I mean that if a crime was 
committed, L’payr has been le- 
gally arrested and can therefore 
be taken back to Gtet. We will 
then hear no more from him ever 
and we will also be rid of that 
bunch of pseudopod -clacking 
Gtetan shysters. That will leave 
us with only one problem — Os- 
borne Blatch. Once L’payr is gone 
and we have this terrestrial to 
ourselves, I think we can handle 
him— one way or another. But 
first and foremost, Corporal Pah- 
Chi-Luh, a crime — some crime — 
has to have been committed by 
L’payr during his sojourn on 
Earth. Set up your bed in the 
law library.” 

Shortly afterward, Pah-Chi- 
Luh left for Earth. 

Now please, Hoy, no moralistic 
comments! You know as well as I 
do that this sort of thing has been 
done before, here and there, in 
Outlying Patrol Offices. I don’t 
like it any more than you, but I 
was faced with a major emer- 
gency. Besides, there was no 
doubt but that this L’payr, ame- 
boid master criminal, had had 
punishment deferred far too long. 
In fact, one might say that mor- 



PARTY OF THE TWO PARTS 



17 



ally I was completely and abso- 
lutely in the right. 

Pah-Chi-Luh returned to 
Earth, as I've said, this time dis- 
guised as an editorial assistant. 
He got a job in the publishing 
house that had brought out the 
biology textbook. The original 
photographs were still in the 
files of that establishment. By 
picking his man carefully and 
making a good many mind-stim- 
ulating comments, the stellar 
corporal finally inspired one of 
the technical editors to examine 
the photographs and have the 
material on which they were 
printed analyzed. 

The material was trab, a syn- 
thetic textile much in use on Gtet 
and not due to be developed by 
humanity for at least three cen- 
turies. 

In no time at all, almost 
every woman in America was 
wearing lingerie made of frab, 
the novelty fabric of the year. 
And since L’payr was ultimately 
responsible for this illegal tech- 
nological spurt, we at last had 
him where we wanted him! 

He was very sporting about 
it, Hoy. 

“The end of a long road for 
me, Sergeant,” he said resigned- 
ly. “I congratulate you. Crime 
does not pay. Lawbreakers al- 
ways lose.” 

“Right,” I agreed. “About time 
you learned that.” 

28 



¥ WENT off to prepare the ex- 
tradition forms, without a care 
in the Galaxy. There was Blatch, 
of course, but he was only a hu- 
man. And by this time, having 
gotten involved in all kinds of 
questionable dealings myself, I 
was determined to make quick 
work of him. After all, one might 
as well get blasted for a skreek 
as a launt! 

But when I returned to escort 
the Gtetan to his fellow-ame- 
boids, I almost fell through the 
surface of Pluto. Where there had 
been one L’payr, there were now 
two! Smaller L’payrs, of course 
— half the size of the original, to 
be exact — but L’payrs unmistak- 
ably. 

In the interval, he had repro- 
duced! 

How? That gargle the Earth- 
man had demanded, Hoy. It had 
been L’payr’s idea all along, his 
last bit of insurance. Once the 
Earthman had received the gar- 
gle, he had smuggled it to L’payr, 
who had hidden it in his cell, 
intending to use it as a last re- 
sort. 

That gargle. Hoy, was salt 
water! 

So there I was. The Gtetans 
informed me that their laws cov- 
ered such possibilities, but much 
help their laws were to me. 

“A crime has been committed, 
pornography has been sold,” the 
spokesman reiterated. “We de- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mand our prisoner. Both of him!” 
“Pursuant to Galactic Statutes 
6,009,371 through 6,106,514,” Os- 
borne Blatch insisted, “I demand 
immediate release, restitution to 
the extent of two billion Galactic 
Megawhars, a complete and writ- 
ten — ” 

And . 

“It’s probably true that our 
ancester, L’payr, committed all 
sorts of indiscretions,” lisped one 
of the two young ameboids in the 
cell next to Osborne Blatch, “but 
what does that have to do with 
us? L’payr paid for his crimes 
by dying in childbirth. We are 
young and innocent. Don’t tell 
us the big, powerful Galaxy be- 
lieves in punishing little children 
for the sins of their parents!” 
What would you have done? 

I shipped the whole mess off 
to Patrol Headquarters — the 
Gtetan extradition party and 
their mess of judicial citations, 
Osborne Blatch and his umbrella, 
the biology textbook, the original 
bundle of pornographic pictures, 
and last but not at all least, two 
— count ’em, two — dewy young 
ameboids. Call them L’payr sub- 
one and L’payr sub-two. Do any- 
thing you like with them when 
they get there, but please don’t 
tell me what it is! 

And if you can figure out a 
solution with the aid of some of 
the more ancient and wiser heads 
at headquarters, and figure it out 



before the Old One ruptures a 
gloccistomorph, Pah - Chi - Luh 
and I will be pathetically, etern- 
ally grateful. 

If not — well, we’re standing by 
here at Outlying Patrol Office 
1001625 with bags packed. 
There’s something to be said for 
the Black Hole in Cygnus — in- 
valuable experience for a Patrol- 
man. 

Personally, Hoy, I’d say that 
the whole trouble is caused by 
creatures who insist on odd and 
colorful methods of continuing 
their race, instead of doing it 
sanely and decently by means of 
spore-pod explosion!

H ER mother had warned 
her. “Are you out of your 
mind, Amelia? Why in 
heaven’s name must you marry 
a pioneer ? How do you expect 
to be happy in a wilderness?” 
“The Cap isn’t a wilderness, 
Mother,” Amelia had said. 

“It isn’t civilized. It’s a crude, 
primitive place. And how long 
will this pioneer be satisfied 
there? I know the type. He’ll al- 
ways want some new place to 
conquer.” 

“Then I’ll conquer it with 
him,” Amelia had said, certain 
•of her own pioneering spirit. 

Her mother wasn’t so sure. 
“Frontier life is hard, dear. 
Harder than you imagine. Are

you really prepared to give 
up your friends, all the comforts 
you’ve known?” 

“Yes!” 

Her mother wanted to say 
more. But since her husband’s 
death, she had become less cer- 
tain of her own convictions, less 
determined to impose them on 
others. 

“It’s your life,” she said at 
last. 

“Don’t worry, Mother, I know 
what I’m doing,” Amelia said. 

She knew that Dirk Bogren 
couldn’t stand crowding. He was 
a big man and he needed elbow 
room, and silence, and free air 
to breathe. He had told her 
about his father, who had set- 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tied in the newly reclaimed Gobi 
Desert. It broke the old man’s 
heart when the place got so 
crowded that land had to be 
fenced in according to county 
regulations and he died with his 
face turned toward the stars. 

That was Dirk, too. She mar- 
ried him, and moved to the 
desolate Southern Polar Cap. 

But settlers came after them, 
and soon the Cap was called 
Cap City, and then it had stores 
and factories, and neat little 
suburbs stretching across the 
atom-heated land. 

It happened sooner than she 
ever expected. 

/~VNE evening they were sitting 
on the veranda, and Dirk 
was looking over his land. He 
stared for a long time at the tip 
of a radar tower on a distant 
rise of the land. 

“Getting crowded around 
here,” he said finally. 

“Yes, it is — a little,” Amelia 
agreed. 

“They’ll be building a golf 
course next. Figure it’s time to 
move on?” 

“All right,” Amelia said, after 
the slightest hesitation. And that 
was all that had to be said. 

They sold their farm. They 
bought a second-hand space- 
ship and filled it with the barest 
necessities of life. The evening 
before blastoff, Dirk’s friends 



threw a farewell party for him. 

They were the old inhabitants 
and they could remember when 
the Cap was still partly ice 
and snow. They kidded Dirk, 
half enviously. 

“Going to the asteroids, eh?” 
“That’s the place,” Dirk said. 
“But you’re soft!” an old man 
cackled. “Easy living’s got you, 
Dirk.” 

“Oh, I don’t know.” 

“Think you can still work an 
honest five-hour day?” 

Dirk grinned and drank his 
beer, and listened to the women 
give Amelia advice. 

“Take plenty of warm things. 
/ remember on Mars — ” 
“First-aid equipment — ” 

“The trouble with low grav- 
ity—” 

“Dirk!” a man shouted. “You 
taking a pretty little thing like 
her to an asteroid ?” 

“Sure,” Dirk said. 

“She won’t like it,” another 
man warned. “No parties, no 
new clothes, no doodads.” 
“Folks go crazy from over- 
work out there.” 

“Don’t you believe them,” an 
older woman put in hastily. 
“You’ll love it once you get 
used to it.” 

“I’m sure I will,” Amelia said 
politely and hoped it was true. 

Just before blastoff, she called 
her mother and told her the 
news. 



SUBSISTENCE LEVEL

Her mother wasn’t surprised. 

“Well, dear,” she said, “it 
won’t be easy. But you knew 
that before you married him. 
The asteroids — that’s where your 
father wanted to go.” 

Amelia remembered her fath- 
er as a gentle, soft-spoken man. 
Every night, when he returned 
from the bank, he would read 
through the ads for used space- 
ships and he would compile de- 
tailed lists of the equipment an 
explorer would need. Mother 
was dead set against any change 
and would not be moved. There 
were few open arguments, but 
a bitterness existed beneath the 
surface — until all bitterness was 
resolved when a helicopter 
smashed into her father’s car 
one day, when he was returning 
from the bank. 

“Try to be a good wife to 
him,” her mother urged. 

“Of course I will,” Amelia de- 
clared a little angrily. 

rpHE new frontiers were in 
space, for Earth was tame 
and settled now. Dirk had stud- 
ied the available charts of the 
Asteroid Belt, but they didn’t 
tell him much. No one had ever 
penetrated very far and the vast 
extent was simply marked un- 
known TERRITORY. 

It was a long journey and a 
dangerous one, but free land 
was there, land for the taking, 



and all the room a man could 
ask. Dirk fought through the 
shifting patterns of rock with 
steady patience. The spaceship 
was always pointed implacably 
outward, though no route was 
marked. 

“We’re not turning back,” he 
told Amelia, “so there’s no sense 
charting a way.” 

She nodded agreement, but 
her breath came short when she 
looked at the bleak, dead spots 
of light ahead. She couldn’t help 
feeling apprehensive about their 
new life, the grim, lonely exist- 
ence of the frontier. She shivered 
and put her hand over Dirk’s. 

He smiled, never taking his 
eyes off the dials. 

They found a slab of rock sev- 
eral miles long by a mile wide. 
They landed on the dark, air- 
less little world, set up their 
pressure dome and turned on 
the gravity. As soon as it ap- 
proached normal, Dirk set to 
work uncrating the Control 
Robot. It was a long, tiring job, 
but finally he inserted the tape 
and activated the controls. 

The robot went to work. Dirk 
turned on all available search- 
lights. Using the small crane, he 
lifted their Frontier Shelter out 
of the ship’s hold, placed it near 
the center of the dome, and 
activated it. The Shelter opened 
like a gigantic flower, blossom- 
ing into a neat five-room 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dwelling, complete with basic 
furniture, kitchen, plumbing, and 
disposal units. 

It was a start. But everything 
couldn’t be unpacked at once. 
The temperature control was 
buried somewhere in the hold of 
the ship, and Dirk had to warm 
their house with an auxiliary 
heater hooked to the generator. 

Amelia was too cold to make 
dinner. The temperature in the 
Shelter hovered around 52 de- 
grees Fahrenheit. Even in her 
Explorers, Inc., furs, she was 
cold, and the dismal glow of the 
fluorescents made her feel colder. 

“Dirk,” she asked timidly, 
“couldn’t you make it a little 
warmer?” 

“I suppose I could, but that 
would slow down the robot.” 

“I didn’t know,” Amelia said. 
“I’ll be all right.” 

But it was impossible work- 
ing under fluorescents and she 
set the dial wrong on the Basic 
Ration Pack. The steak came 
out overdone, the potatoes were 
lumpy, and the chill was barely 
taken off the apple pie. 

“I’m afraid I’m not much good 
at roughing it,” Amelia said, 
trying to smile. 

“Forget it,” Dirk told her, and 
wolfed down his food as though 
it were regular Earthside fare. 

They turned in. Amelia could 
hardly sleep on the emergency 
mattress. But she had the dubi- 



ous satisfaction of knowing that 
Dirk was uncomfortable, too. 
He had been softened by the 
relatively easy life at the Cap. 

W HEN they awoke, every- 
seemed more cheerful. The 
Control Robot, working through 
the night, had set up the main 
lighting plant. Now they had 
their own little sun in the sky 
and a fair approximation of 
night and day. The Control had 
also unloaded the heavy Farm 
Robots, and they in turn had 
unloaded the Household Robots. 

Dirk directed the topsoil 
manufacturing and coordinated 
the work of his robots as they 
force-seeded the soil. He worked 
a full five-hour day, and when 
the little sun was low on the 
horizon, he came home ex- 
hausted. 

Amelia, meanwhile, had taped 
in her basic food sequences dur- 
ing the day, and that evening 
she was able to give her husband 
a plain but hearty eight-course 
dinner. 

“Of course, it’s not the twenty- 
plate special,” she apologized as 
he munched on the hors 
d’oeuvres. 

“Never could eat all that food, 
anyhow,” Dirk said. 

“And the wine isn’t properly 
chilled.” 

Dirk looked up and grinned. 
“Hell, honey, I could drink 



SUBSISTENCE LEVEL 



33 



warm Ola-Cola and never notice 
it.” 

“Not while I'm cook here,” 
Amelia said. But she could see 
one advantage of frontier life al- 
ready — a hungry man would eat 
anything that was put in front 
of him. 

After helping Amelia pile the 
dishes into the washer, Dirk set 
up a projector in their living 
room. As a double feature flicked 
across the screen, they sat in 
durable foam-rubber chairs, just 
as generations of pioneers before 
them had done. This continuity 
with the past touched Amelia 
deeply. 

And Dirk unpacked their 
regular bed and adjusted the 
gravity under it. That night they 
slept as soundly as they ever 
had at the Cap. 

But the work on the asteroid 
was ceaseless and unremitting. 
Dirk labored five and, several 
times, even six hours a day with 
his Field Robots, changing tapes, 
bellowing commands, sweating 
to get the best out of them. In 
a few days, the force-seeded 
plants began to show green 
against the synthesized black 
loam. But it was apparent at 
once that it was a stunted crop. 

Dirk’s mouth tightened and 
he set his robots to pumping 
trace elements into the soil. He 
tinkered with his sun until he 
he had increased its ultraviolet 



output. But the resulting crop, 
a week later, was a failure. 

A MELIA came out to the 
fields that day. Dirk’s face 
was outlined by the garish sun- 
set and his clenched fists were 
on his hips. He was staring at 
the poor, dwarfed, shoulder-high 
com. 

There was nothing Amelia 
could say. She put her hand 
comfortingly on his shoulder. 

“We’re not licked,” Dirk mut- 
tered. 

“What will you do?” Amelia 
asked. 

“I’ll plant a crop a week, if 
need be. I’ll work the robots 
until their joints crystallize. This 
soil will yield. It must yield!” 
Amelia stepped back, surpris- 
ed at the vehemence of his tone. 
But she could understand how 
he felt. On Earth, a farmer sim- 
ply gave the orders to his Con- 
trol Robot, and in a few days 
he was ready to harvest. Dirk 
had been working and watching 
this miserable crop for over a 
week. 

“What will you do with it?” 
she asked. 

“Feed it to the animals,” Dirk 
said contemptuously. They walk- 
ed to the house together in the 
gathering twilight. 

The next day, Dirk took his 
farm animals out of the freez- 
ers, reanimated them, and set 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



up their pens and stalls. The 
beasts fed contentedly on the 
corn and wheat. Force-seeds 
went back into the ground — 
and the second growing was of 
normal size. 

Amelia had little time to ob- 
serve this triumph. Their five- 
room dwelling was small by 
Earth standards, but it still 
needed coordinating. 

It was difficult. She had grown 
up in an ordinary suburban 
home, where the housekeeping 
duties were arranged in auto- 
matic time sequences. Here, each 
function was handled by an in- 
dividual machine. There was no 
time to recess them into the 
walls and they were forever in 
the way, ruining her decor, mak- 
ing the house look like a machine 
shop. 

Instead of a single, central- 
ized switchboard, Amelia had 
dials, buttons and switches 
everywhere, jury-rigged in cas- 
ual style. At first, she had to 
spend a large part of each day 
just hunting for the proper con- 
trols for dry-cleaning, floor- 
scrubbing, window-washing, and 
other necessities she had taken 
for granted at home. Dirk had 
promised to hook all the cir- 
cuits together, but he was al- 
ways busy with his own work. 

Her House Robots were im- 
possible. They were frontier 
models, built for durability, with 

SUBSISTENCE LEVEL 



none of the refinements she had 
known. Their memories were 
poor and they could anticipate 
nothing. At the end of the day, 
Amelia’s ears would ring from 
their harsh, raucous voices. And 
most of the time her house look- 
ed as though the robots had 
been attacking it, instead of 
cleaning it. 

^T^HE long five-hour days of 
-*• drudgery went on and on, un- 
til Amelia felt she couldn’t take 
any more of it. In desperation, 
she called her mother on the 
tele-circuit. 

In the tiny, streaked screen, 
she could see her mother sitting 
in her favorite pneumo-chair be- 
side the polarized glass wall. It 
was adjusted for vision now, 
and Amelia could see the city in 
the distance, springing upward 
in its glistening beauty. 

“What seems to be wrong?” 
her mother asked. 

A robot glided behind her 
mother’s chair and noiselessly 
put down a cup of tea. Amelia 
was sure that no command had 
been given. The sensitive mech- 
anical had anticipated her, the 
way Earth robots did after long 
acquaintance with a family. 

“Well, it’s — ” Amelia began 
to explain almost hysterically. 

Her own robot lurched through 
the room, almost breaking down 
a door when the photo-electric 

35

circuit didn’t respond quickly 
enough. It was too much. 

“I want to come home!” 
Amelia cried. 

“You know you’re always 
welcome, dear. But what about 
your husband?” 

"Dirk will come, I’m sure of 
it. We can find him a good job, 
can't we, Mother?” 

“I suppose so. But is that what 
he wants?” 

“What?” Amelia asked blank- 

ly- 

“Will a man like that be 
satisfied on Earth? Will he re- 
turn?” 

“He will if he loves me.” 

“Do you love him?” 

“Mother, that’s unfair!” 
Amelia said, feeling a little sick 
inside. 

“It’s a mistake to make a 
man do something he doesn’t 
want to do,” her mother told 
her. “Your father . Anyhow, 
don’t you think you could make 
it work?” 

“I don’t know,” Amelia said. 
“I guess — I guess I’ll try.” 

Things did get better after 
that. Amelia learned how to live 
with her home, to overlook its 
inconveniences. She could see 
that someday it might be as 
pleasant as they had eventually 
made their farm on the Cap. 

But they had left the Cap. 
And as soon as this place was 
livable, Dirk would want to 



move on, into a fresh wilderness. 

One day, Dirk found her sit- 
ting beside their tiny swimming 
pool, weeping hopelessly. 

“Hey!” he said. “What’s 
wrong?” 

"Nothing.” 

Clumsily he stroked her hair. 
“Tell me.” 

“Nothing, nothing.” 

“Te// me.” 

“Oh, it’s all the work of mak- 
ing a nice home and putting up 
curtains and training the robots 
and everything, and knowing — ” 
"Knowing what?” 

“That someday you’ll want 
to move on and it’ll all be for 
nothing.” She sat up and tried 
to smile. “I’m sorry, Dirk. I 
shouldn’t have mentioned it.” 

"T|IRK thought for a long 
time. Then he looked at her 
closely, and said, “I want to 
make you happy. You believe 
that, don’t you?” 

She nodded. 

“I guess we’ve done enough 
moving around. This is our 
home. We’ll stay right here.” 
“Really, Dirk?” 

“It’s a promise.” 

She hugged him tightly. Then 
she remembered. “Good heav- 
ens! My Napoleons will be ruin- 
ed!” She ran off to the kitchen. 

The next weeks were the hap- 
piest Amelia had ever known. 
In the morning, their pre-set sun 



SUBSISTENCE LEVEL

burst into glory, waking them to 
the morning chores. After they 
had a hearty breakfast, the work 
of the day began. 

It was never dull. One day 
Amelia and Dirk might erect a 
meteor screen to reinforce their 
pressure dome. Or they might 
tinker with the wind machine, 
to help the reanimated bees pro- 
vide better pollination for the 
crops. 

In the evenings, they had their 
sunsets. Sometimes Dirk would 
have the Field Robots stage a 
clumsy dance. He was a firm 
but understanding master. He 
believed that a litle variety was 
good for robots as well as for 
humans. 

Amelia regretted Earth only 
once. That was when Dirk pick- 
ed up a Lunar rebroadcast of 
the Easter Parade on their tele- 
vision set. The music and bright 
colors made Amelia’s heart 
ache — but it was only for a 
moment. 

Their first visitor came several 
months later in a gaily decor- 
ated spaceship that settled on 
Dirk’s rough-hewn landing field. 
Painted on its side in letters 
eight feet high was the sign 
potter’s traveling store. A 
dapper young man climbed out, 
sniffed the atmosphere, wrink- 
led his nose, and walked up to 
the house. 

“What can I do for you, 



stranger?” Dirk asked at the 
door. 

“Good day, countryman. I’m 
Potter,” the young man said, 
extending his hand which Dirk 
did not shake. '“I was making 
my usual swing around Mars 
when I heard about you folks 
out here. Thought you might 
like to buy a few gimcracks to 
— to brighten up the place.” 

“Don’t want a thing,” Dirk 
said. 

Potter grinned amiably, but 
he had seen the severe, undecor- 
ated farmhouse and the spartan 
swimming pool. 

“Something for the wife?” 
Potter asked, winking at Amel- 
ia. “I won’t be around this way 
for a while.” 

"Glad to hear it,” Dirk said. 

But Amelia, her eyes glowing, 
wanted to go through Potter's 
whole stock, and she dragged 
Dirk along. 

T IKE a child, she tried out all 
the household appliances, the 
modem time-saving gadgets for 
the home. She looked longingly 
at the dresses— dainty, sheer, 
with automatic necklines and 
hems — and thought of her own 
drab tailored fashions. 

But then she saw the Acting 
Robots. With their amazingly 
human appearance and civiliz- 
ed mannerisms, they reminded 
her poignantly of home. 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Couldn't we buy a troupe?” 
she asked Dirk. 

“We’ve got the movies, haven’t 
we? They were good enough for 
my father — ” 

“But, Dirk, these robots put 
on real plays!” 

“This particular troupe puts 
on all hit plays clear back to 
George Bernard Shaw,” Potter 
told them. 

Dirk looked with distaste at 
the handsome humanoid ma- 
chines. “What else do they do?” 

“Do? They act,” Potter said. 
“Good Lord, countryman, you 
wouldn’t expect a work of art 
to do farm labor, would you?” 

“Why not?” Dirk asked. “I 
don’t believe in pampering ro- 
bots. Farm labor’s good enough 
for my Control Robot and I’ll 
bet he’s smarter than these gim- 
cracks.” 

“Your Control Robot is not 
an artist,” Potter said loftily. 

Amelia was so wistful that 
Dirk bought the troupe. While 
he was lugging them to the 
house — Acting Robots were too 
delicate to walk over stony 
ground — Amelia bought a dress. 

“What’s a girl like you doing 
in this wilderness?” Potter asked. 

“I like it.” 

“Oh, it’s livable, I suppose. 
Life of toil, doing without lux- 
uries, advancing the frontier, all 
that sort of thing. But don’t 
you get sick of roughing it?” 



Amelia didn’t answer him. 

Potter shrugged his shoulders. 
“Well,” he said, “this sector’s 
ripe for colonization. You’ll be 
having company before long.” 

Amelia took her dress and re- 
turned to the house. Potter 
blasted off. 

Dirk was forced to admit the 
Acting Robots made pleasant 
company during the long, still 
evenings. He even became quite 
fond of Man and Superman. 
After a while, he began to give 
the robots acting directions, 
which they naturally ignored. 

Still, he was always certain 
that his Control Robot could do 
as well, if the voice box were 
only improved a little. 

Amusements, however, were 
swallowed in the long five-hour 
working days. Dirk began to 
collect other little asteroids and 
grapple them to his original 
claim. He force-planted a forest, 
constructed a waterfall, and 
tinkered with his father’s old cli- 
mate machine. 

Finally he got it working and 
was able to reproduce seasons 
on their planetoid. 

O NE day, the tele-circuit 
spluttered into life and Dirk 
received a spacegram. It was 
from Explorers, Inc., an Earth 
firm that manufactured a com- 
plete line of equipment for pio- 
neers. They offered Dirk a job 



SUBSISTENCE LEVEL

as head of their main testing 
laboratory, at a salary just a 
little short of stupendous. 

“Oh, Dirk!” Amelia gasped. 
“What an opportunity!” 

“Opportunity? What are you 
talking about?” 

“You could be wealthy. You 
could have anything you want- 
ed.” 

“I’ve got what I want,” Dirk 
said. “Tell them no, thanks.” 
Amelia sighed wearily. She 
cabled Dirk’s refusal to the 
firm — but added that his ser- 
vices might possibly be avail- 
able later. 

After all, there was no sense 
in completely shutting the door. 

D URING the long summer, 
another spaceship swung 
over Dirk’s landing field. This 
one was older and even more 
battered than Dirk’s, and it 
dropped the last five feet to 
the ground, jarring the whole 
small planetoid. A young couple 
staggered out, on the point of 
collapse. 

They were Jean and Percy 
Phillips, who had homesteaded 
several thousand miles from 
Dirk’s holdings. Everything had 
gone wrong. Their power had 
failed, their robots had broken 
down, their food had run out. 
In desperation, they had set 
out for Dirk’s farm. They were 
near starvation, having been 



without food for almost two 
whole days. 

Dirk and Amelia gave them 
the hospitality of the frontier 
and quickly nursed them back 
to health. It became readily ap- 
parent that the Phillipses were 
ignorant of any of the rules of 
survival. 

Percy Phillips didn’t even 
know how to handle robots. 
Dirk had to explain it to him. 

“You have to show them who’s 
boss,” Dirk said. 

“But I should think that the 
proper command, given in a low, 
pleasant voice — ’* 

“Not out here,” Dirk said, 
with a positive shake of his 
head. “These Work Robots are 
a stupid, unresponsive lot. 
They’re sullen and resentful. 
You have to pound the com- 
mands into them. Kick them, if 
need be.” 

Phillips raised both eyebrows. 
“Mistreat a robot?” 

“You have to show them who 
the human is.” 

“But in Colonization School, 
we were taught to treat our ro- 
bots with dignity,” Phillips pro- 
tested. 

“You’ll lose a lot of Earth 
notions out here,” Dirk said 
bluntly. “Now listen to me. I 
was raised by robots. Some of 
my best friends are robots. I 
know what I’m talking about. 
The only way they’ll show you 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



any respect is if you make 
them.” 

P HILLIPS admitted doubt- 
fully that Dirk might be 
right. 

“Of course I’m right!” Dirk 
stated. ‘‘You say your power 
supply failed?” 

‘‘Yes, but the robots didn’t — ” 
‘‘Didn’t they? They have ac- 
cess to the charge outlets, haven’t 
they?” 

‘‘Of course. When they’re low, 
they recharge themselves.” 
“You think they stop when 
they’re full? A robot’ll keep on 
drawing power until it’s all gone. 
Haven’t you learned that old 
robot stunt?” 

“I guess that’s what happen- 
ed,” Phillips said. “But why 
would they do it?” 

“Robots are congenital 
drunks,” Dirk told him. “The 
manufacturers stamp it into 
them. That way, they burn out 
faster and you have to buy more 
robots. Believe me, you’ll be 
doing them a favor if you keep 
them power-starved.” 

“I guess I’ve got a lot to 
learn,” Phillips sighed. 

And Jean, his wife, had even 
more to learn. Amelia had to 
show her over and over again 
that buttons won’t push them- 
selves, switches won’t close 
without timing circuits, and 
dials won’t leap of their own 



free will to the proper setting, 
Cleaning Robots can’t be trust- 
ed with the cooking, and the 
Rub-A-Tub, although a versa- 
tile instrument, won't put up 
the preserves. 

“I never thought there was 
so much to it,” Jean said. “How 
do you do it all?” 

“You’ll learn,” Amelia assur- 
ed her, remembering her own 
early days on the frontier. 

The Phillipses set out again 
for their claim. Amelia had 
thought it would be lonely when 
they were gone, but it was pleas- 
ant to be alone with Dirk again, 
to get back to work on their 
farm. 

But people wouldn’t leave 
them alone. Next, a man from 
Mars Rural Power called. Home- 
steaders were moving into the 
Asteroid Belt, he explained, so 
the power outlets were being 
extended. He wanted to hook 
up Dirk’s farm to the Mars 
Power tight-beam network. 
“Nope,” Dirk said. 

“Why not? It’s not expen- 
sive — ” 

“I make my own power.” 

“Oh, these little generators,” 
the man said, looking scorn- 
fully at Dirk’s sun. “But for 
really high-gain performance — ” 
“Don’t need it. This farm runs 
fast enough to suit me.” 

“You could get more work 
out of your robots.” 



SUBSISTENCE LEVEL 



41 



“Just wear them out faster.” 

“Then you could get the lat- 
est models.” 

“The new ones just burn out 
faster.” 

“A better generating system, 
then,” the man said. “That lit- 
tle sun of yours doesn’t have 
much of an output.” 

“Puts out enough to satisfy 
me.” 

The man shook his head won- 
deringly. “I guess I’ll never un- 
derstand you pioneers,” he said, 
and left. 

rwiHEY tried to resume their 
life. But lights were begin- 
ning to wink on from neighbor- 
ing asteroids, and the Lunar 
television was jammed with local 
signals. The mail rocket began 
to make weekly stops and a 
travel bureau started trips into 
the Belt. 

The familiar, dissatisfied look 
came over Dirk’s face. He stud- 
ied the sky around him. It was 
closing in. He was losing his 
elbow room, and the silence of 
his farm was broken by the 
flame of passing rockets. 

But he had promised Amelia 
and he was going, to keep that 
promise if it killed him. His 
face grew gaunt and he began 
to work six, seven — sometimes 
actually eight — hours a day. 

A sewing machine salesman 
called, and a bright, determined 



woman tried to sell Dirk the 
Solar Encyclopedia. The ship 
routes were established now and 
the long, dangerous trail had be- 
come a superhighway. 

One night, while Dirk and 
Amelia were sitting on their 
porch, they saw an immense 
sign light up the sky. It stretch- 
ed over miles of space, and 
read: rosen’s shopping center. 

STORES, RESTAURANT, BEST DRINKS 
IN THE ASTEROIDS. 

“Stores,” Amelia murmured. 
“And a restaurant! Oh, Dirk, 
couldn’t we go?” 

“Why not?” he said, with a 
helpless shrug of his shoulders. 

The next day, Amelia put on 
her new dress and made Dirk 
wear his one custom -tailored 
suit. They got into the old space- 
ship and set out. 

Rosen's Center, a bustling 
frontier town sprawling across 
four linked asteroids, was strug- 
gling valiantly to become a city. 
Already driftways had been in- 
stalled on all the streets. The 
town was filled with noisy, 
eager people, and robots clump- 
ed down the ways, loaded with 
gear. 

Amelia took Dirk into a res- 
taurant, where they were servecf 
a real Earthside dinner. Dirk 
didn’t enjoy it. He was slightly 
nauseous from breathing other 
people’s air and the food was 
too delicate to stick to one’s ribs. 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The meal ended with Dirk or- 
dering the wrong wine and try- 
ing to tip the robot waiter. 

Thoroughly miserable, he al- 
lowed himself to be dragged 
from one store to another. The 
only time he showed any inter- 
est was when they entered a 
heavy-tools shop. 

He examined a new anti- 
gravity engine. It was a model 
he had never seen. 

“Just the thing for canceling 
heavy-planet effects,” the robot 
clerk told him. “We believe this 
machine would work splendidly 
on the moons of Jupiter, for 
example.” 

“The moons of Jupiter?” 

“Just an example, sir,” the 
robot said. “No one’s ever been 
there. It’s completely unexplor- 
ed territory.” 

¥AIRK nodded absently, rub- 
bing his hand along the ma- 
chine’s burnished surface. 

“Look, Amelia,” he said. “Do 
you suppose that job on Earth 
is still open?” 

“It might be,” she answered. 
“Why?” 



"Might as well be on Earth as 
here. These people are playing 
at pioneering.” 

“Do you think you’d be hap- 
py on Earth?” 

“Might.” 

“I doubt it,” Amelia said. 
She was remembering how con- 
tented they had been on the 
asteroid. Their life had been full 
and complete, just the two of 
them, pushing back the wilder- 
ness with their rude tools — do- 
ing without — improvising. 

That had been before people 
came, before Earth’s noisy, el- 
bowing civilization had crowded 
up to their doorstep. 

Her mother had learned the' 
hard way and had tried to tell 
her. Dirk would never be happy 
on Earth. And happiness for her 
was impossible if he fretted his 
life away as her father had, 
working on a job he hated and 
dreaming of another more satis- 
fying one. 

“We’ll take the anti-grav en- 
gine,” she told the robot. She 
turned to Dirk. “We’ll need that 
out Jupiter way.”

MAIL BY ROCKET 



E ARLIER this year, the 
aviation magazines car- 
ried a short official an- 
nouncement to the effect that a 
committee had been appointed 
to study the feasibility of using 
guided missiles for peacetime 
service as robot mail vehicles. 

This announcement must have 
struck many people as a brand- 
new idea. Actually, it is one of 
those ideas that have been around 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



for quite a while in a kind of 
embryonic form and are now ap- 
proaching realization. The earli- 
est type of missile mail is one 
you’ve probably seen in histori- 
cal movies — the parchment wrap- 
ped around the shaft of an arrow, 
tied securely and shot into the 
castle, or out of it, depending 
on the plot of the story. 

A more modern version of the 
same idea was presented to an 
astonished and presumably in- 
credulous readership in 1810 by 
a long defunct newspaper, the 
Berlin Evening News ( Berliner 
Abendblatter ) . If it had been 
written by an otherwise unknown 
newspaperman of that period, 
nobody might remember it any 
more; but it so happens that the 
author was a still respected Ger- 
man poet of the time. His name 
was Heinrich von Kleist and he 
was the editor of that paper. 

The issue of October 10, 1810, 
carried under the general head- 
ing of “Useful Inventions” an 
article entitled “Preliminary 
Thoughts about Mortar Mail.” 
It began by stating that an elec- 
trical ‘telegraph had been recent- 
ly invented, but fast as it was, 
it could only transmit very brief 
messages, being wholly inade- 
quate for the transmission of 
letters, reports, miscellaneous en- 
closures and packages. This, 
the article continued, could be 
remedied by the introduction of 



a system that ought to work “at 
least within the confines of the 
civilized world.” 

If one established a number of 
fixed batteries of mortars or 
howitzers within range of each 
other and all located on soft 
ground, these batteries could 
fire letter-filled shells from sta- 
tion to station. “As a quick com- 
putation will show,” the author 
went on, a letter dispatched by 
this means would cover the dis- 
tance from Berlin to Stettin (75 
miles) or to Breslau (180 miles) 
in half a day or in about one- 
tenth the time required by a 
mounted courier. 

T HE next issue of the paper 
carried a letter by a “resi- 
dent of the city” — presumably 
the editor — which states that the 
writer considers neither the elec- 
tric telegraph nor the mortar 
mail as “useful inventions.” Since 
most news is bad news, a really 
useful invention would be one 
which slows the mails down; ox- 
cart mail might be the proper 
solution to the problem. Whether 
Heinrich von Kleist was merely 
trying to amuse himself and his 
readers or whether his slightly 
mocking style was designed as 
camouflage for some wishful 
ideas in the back of his mind is 
something nobody will ever be 
able to establish. At any event, 
no mortar mail was ever tried.

But later in the nineteenth 
century, something that looks 
more modern by far was actually 
done — in the South Seas, there 
was a genuine rocket mail. 

The rockets used were very 
large blackpowder missiles of the 
Congreve type; the place where 
they carried mail canisters was 
the Tonga Islands to the south 
of Samoa. By air, the rockets 
bridged difficult reefs. But since 
quite a number of canisters were 
never found and others split open 
on impact, so that the sea water 
ruined the mail, this experiment 
did not last long. It was dis- 
carded in favor of “buoy mail,” 
which was somewhat more re- 
liable. 

The missile-mail idea was 
shelved until modem rocket 
theory came along three decades 
ago. Interestingly enough, how- 
ever, of the two classical works 
which started rocket theory, 
neither Dr. Robert H. Goddard’s 
study of 1920 nor Professor Her- 
mann Oberth’s long paper of 
1923 says a word about mail 
transportation by rocket. This 
notion occurred to Oberth in 1927 
in the course of correspondence 
with one Dr. Franz von Hoefft, 
who was then president of the 
Austrian Rocket Society. It as- 
sumed definite shape for the first 
time in a lecture delivered by 
Professor Oberth during the first 
days of June 1928, on the occa- 



sion of the annual meeting of the 
Scientific Society for Aeronautics 
in Danzig. 

The manuscript for the lecture 
contains the following statement, 
never before published in Eng- 
lish: 

I would suggest, therefore, to begin 
with the building of small rockets with 
automatic guidance that can bridge 
distances from 600-1200 miles and carry 
a payload of 22-44 lbs. Several fac- 
tors that I cannot discuss now because 
of lack of time happen to facilitate 
the automatic guidance of a rocket 
so that, in my opinion, it should be 
possible to pre-determine the place 
at which the rocket returns into the 
atmosphere with an uncertainty of only 
a few miles. 

This rocket, therefore, seems suit- 
able for transporting urgent mail over 
long distances in a very short time. The 
rocket would have to land by means 
of a parachute; some other means of 
transportation would then carry the 
apparatus to its precise destination. 
At a later date, I would equip such a 
rocket with a powerful booster that 
would result in transoceanic ranges. 
The booster rocket would drop off after 
one minute and should be easy to 
locate. 

A FTER this lecture, it became 
customary among rocket en- 
thusiasts to consider the mail- 
carrying rocket the “second step 
in rocket development.” The first 
step, following preliminary and 
purely experimental models, 
would be the high -altitude in- 
strument-carrying research rock- 
et, vertically rising; the second 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



step, the long-range rocket with 
a payload consisting of mail. 
When it looked, in 1929, as if an 
early prototype of the high alti- 
tude research rocket would be 
realized very soon, a German 
journalist interviewed the Ameri- 
can Ambassador, Dr. Shurman, 
about his attitude toward trans- 
atlantic rocket mail. 

Ambassador Shurman wisely 
refrained from having opinions 
about technological detail. “Just 
two years ago,” he told the 
journalist, “the chair you are 
sitting in was occupied by Dr. 
Eckener of the Zeppelin works, 
who talked to me about trans- 
atlantic mail by dirigible.” But 
the Ambassador did give an opin- 
ion on the legal procedure re- 
quired. 



If it had been proved, he said, 
that the rocket would not repre- 
sent any danger to life or limb or 
the property of American citi- 
zens, the proper thing to do would 
be to ask for permission at the 
U. S. Embassy. The Ambassador 
would then forward this request 
by cable to the Department of 
State, the Department of State 
would pass it on to the Presi- 
dent, and the President would 
call a cabinet meeting, which 
would make the final decision on 
the matter. 

How such a transatlantic mail 
shot would have looked, and 
would still look, is shown in Fig. 
1. After initial vertical takeoff, 
the rocket would climb out of 
the atmosphere at a slant, reach 
a rather great height at the mid- 




FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



47 



way point, and dip into the at- 
mosphere again 35 minutes later, 
more than 3000 miles from its 
takeoff point. (The distance 
shown on the diagram is the 
Great Circle distance between 
New York and Cobh.) 

Everything the newspapers told 
during 1929. from the announce- 
ment of the first forthcoming 
high-altitude shot to 40 miles to 
the interview with the Ambassa- 
dor, sounded most impressive, but 
unfortunately things got stuck 
at that point. The first long- 
range rocket did not lift off its 
launching table until 13 years 
later and then it was slated to 
carry a payload of high explo- 
sive, instead of mail, good or 
bad. In this instance, the news 
was bad — in England. 



TOURING those 13 years, the 
story of the idea of the mail 
rocket described a strange curli- 
cue. The theoreticians of the mail 
rocket, with a large expenditure 
of long equations, had always 
been thinking in terms of oceans, 
deserts and steppes. 

In 1931, a very young Austrian 
engineer by the name of Freid- 
rich Schmiedl had quietly estab- 
lished still another possibility. 
Living in the Austrian Alps, he 
was aware of the fact that two 
villages might be eight hours’ 
walk from each other, yet less 
than two miles away as the 
rocket flies. He had built half a 
dozen experimental rockets, had 
tinkered himself a reliable para- 
chute release system, and on the 
second of February, 1931, he had

put 102 letters into a compart- 
ment of his seventh rocket and 
fired it across a mountain. After 
another experimental shot, there 
followed a rocket labeled R-l 
with 333 letters and then, through 
the year 1932, five others. 

Rocket R-l stood 5.6 feet tall, 
had a largest diameter (near the 
head) of 9.6 inches, a smallest 
diameter (at the tail end) of 
9.25 inches, had an empty 
weight of 15.4 lbs. and was pro- 
pelled by a charge of 52.8 lbs. 
of a special blackpowder mix- 
ture. It was made of several lay- 
ers of thin sheet brass, wound, 
for strength, with twine soaked 
in hot carpenters glue. The out- 
side skin was sheet aluminum 
and between the charge and the 
sheet brass there was a layer of 
asbestos. The purpose of the as- 
bestos was to minimize heat con- 
duction forward through the 
metal skin. Without this precau- 
tion, such conducted heat might 
ignite the still unbumed front 
end of the charge and cause an 
explosion. 

Schmiedl’s experiments demon- 
strated that the old Tonga Is- 
lands problem of shooting at 
short range over obstacles (moun- 
tains, in his case) was still very 
much alive. One could also think 
of a few possible applications 
where there was no real obstacle, 
but a special set of circumstances. 
For example, a ship coming from 



America might pass the extreme 
western end of England, Land’s 
End, within rocket range, but 
would not berth in an English 
port for another 12 hours — or 
even later if, as is often done, 
the first port of call is a French 
harbor. The mail could then ar- 
rive ahead of the ship. 

Schmiedl’s mail shots were 
imitated (usually less success- 
fully) in many other countries, 
such as Germany, England, Hol- 
land, the U.S.A., Cuba, India 
and Australia. The bill was 
usually footed by stamp col- 
lectors who, in the hope of future 
rocket mail, wanted to accumu- 
late “forerunners.” 

Then came the second World 
War, bringing the military bom- 
bardment rocket, which, from 
this point of view, might be con- 
sidered a highly efficient and 
mass-produced short-range “ob- 
stacle rocket.” And it brought the 
first real long-range rocket. But 
it failed to produce the mail 
rocket, unless you want to count 
the use of bombardment rockets 
for showering leaflets on the 
enemy under this heading. 

I T is a rather safe prediction to 
say that the long-range mail 
rocket will not become a reality 
in the form in which it was talk- 
ed about in 1929. There are two 
main reasons. One is political. 
As things stand right now, no

government could dare to permit 
international mail transportation 
by long-range rocket. If such 
rockets began to show on the 
radar screen of the receiving sta- 
tion, the radar operator — and 
everybody else concerned — would 
wonder whether they really car- 
ried mail. They might not even 
come from the announced firing 
site. 

The second reason is that the 
transatlantic timetable has un- 
dergone a fundamental change. 
At the time when the American 
Ambassador was asked about his 
opinions, the reasoning ran as 
follows : 

The rocket would need about 
54 hour for the actual trip across 
the Atlantic. If you counted on 
one hour’s delay at the Euro- 
pean (or firing) end and about 
154 hour’s delay at the receiving 
end where the rocket had to be 
fished out of the water and the 
mail sorted, a letter might make 
the trip from “house to house” 
in three hours. Since the time 
difference between Berlin and 
New York is six hours, it would 
even look as if the addressee re- 
ceived his mail three hours be- 
fore it was mailed. 

Even assuming only four mail 
rockets per day, it was virtually 
certain that the majority of the 
letters would reach the addresses 
on the day they were mailed. 
Compared to the steamer sched- 



ule, which involved an interval 
between mailing and delivery of 
at least one week, this was a nice 
and probably important time- 
saving. 

But the mail plane needs only 
about eight hours to cross the 
ocean. Recently, my German 
publisher wrote me an airmail 
letter on a Friday and had my 
reply the following Monday, 
without special delivery at either 
end. Less than two years from 
now, the transatlantic mail planes 
will be turbojets requiring, say, 
six hours for the flight. And an- 
other two years later, this time 
might be reduced to five or even 
four hours. The long-range un- 
manned mail rocket has been 
effectively killed off by the fast 
long-range manned airplane. 

T HE mail-carrying missile, 
however, is a different story. 
It might be useful to mention at 
this point that all missiles, no 
matter how large their number, 
can be sorted into just two cate- 
gories. 

One type of missile is the real 
rocket, which does not rely on 
the air for “lift” the way an air- 
plane does. In fact, the rocket 
missile tries to get out of at least 
the denser layers of the atmos- 
phere as quickly as can be man- 
aged in order to gain maximum 
speed, because a real rocket oper- 
ates at full efficiency only in a 



50 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



vacuum. Like an artillery shell, 
it moves along a trajectory, and 
this group of missiles is therefore 
referred to as “trajectory mis- 
siles.” 

The other group of missiles is 
winged, aerodyhamically sup- 
ported like an airplane, and 
“flies” like an airplane. It does 
not follow a trajectory, but a 
flight path, and these aero- 
dynamically supported missiles 
are therefore known as “flight- 
path missiles” or “cruising mis- 
siles.” 

The V-2 rocket is a true tra- 
jectory missile. The old German 
V-l or buzz bomb and its off- 
spring, the Navy Loon and the 
Martin Matador, are typical 
cruising missiles. 

Of course, no cruising missile 
can compete with a trajectory 
missile when it comes to speed. 
But as mail carriers, they have 
a number of undoubted advan- 
tages. 

Unlike the trajectory missile, 
they are controlled (or at least 
can be controlled) every inch of 
the way. Since they have wings, 
they can be landed like an air- 
plane, on an airport where postal 
facilities already exist. They can 
even be “held” in the air for a 
short time, if necessary. Their 
speed can be much higher than 
that of commercial transports 
and rivals that of the fastest 
fighters. They can, if used as mail 



carriers, be used over and over 
again. 

If they are built for compara- 
tively small payloads, say % ton, 
they could be launched at fre- 
quent intervals. And their oper- 
ation may be cheap enough so 
that the rates for missile mail 
might be not more than perhaps 
triple the airmail rate. 

What will actually happen will 
depend on the studies now under 
way. As of now, it looks as if a 
famous French saying might be 
adapted to read : La fus6e postale 
est morte; vive le projectile 
postal! 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Is there any basic distinction 
between plants and animals that 
also holds true for all one-celled 
organisms? 

D. Shafer 

1910 Andina Avenue 

Cincinnati 37 ; Ohio 

The basic distinction between 
animals and plants is that 
plants have chlorophyll while 
animals do not. There is no 
animal with chlorophyll; ex- 
amples in older textbooks were 
mistakes, caused by algae liv- 
ing in symbiosis with the organ- 
isms in question. Unfortunately, 
as far as orderly pigeon-holing 
is concerned, a number of 
plants have decided to live on 
organic matter and have done

away with their chlorophyll. So 
to make the distinction apply 
in all cases, one would have to 
say that animals are organisms 
that cannot have chlorophyll, 
while plants are organisms that 
can and usually do. This will 
apply to anything larger than 
a virus, to which nothing seems 
to apply. 

Would you please explain how 
the Moon rotates keeping always 
one face toward the Earth? Al- 
so, why Mercury always keeps 
one face toward the Sun? 

Boyce Burgle 
444 12fh Street 
Sparks, Nevada 

Apparently many people 
have some difficulty visualizing 
how one celestial body can re- 
volve around another one in 
such a manner that only one- 
half of the revolving body is 
visible from the central body. 
I have even been asked on 
occasion whether one should 
not say that neither the Moon 
nor Mercury rotates at all. They 
do rotate, however, and the 
problem can be best under- 
stood by making a little experi- 
ment. 

Place a lamp on a table that 
has open space all around it. 
The lamp is the Earth and 
your head represents the Moon. 
Now if you move around the 



table, keeping your eyes fixed 
on some external point, such 
as a window, you revolve 
around the lamp (Earth) with- 
out rotating at all. The result is 
that the lamp will illuminate 
every portion of your head ; 
translated into astronomical 
terms, this means that the 
people on the Earth could see 
every portion of the Moon in 
the course of one month. 

But if you move around the 
table with your eyes always 
fixed on the lamp, you perform 
not only a revolution around 
the Earth, but also one rota- 
tion around your axis, since 
every portion of your head 
would become visible to anoth- 
er (stationary) observer in the 
same room. 

All the moons in our solar 
system behave in this manner 
and, among the planets, Mer- 
cury, the one nearest the Sun. 
This is the inevitable result of 
the action of the gravitational 
field of a large body on a near- 
by small body. Naturally, since 
the time required for one revo- 
lution differs for the various 
moons of a planet with many 
moons, the periods required 
for their rotations differ, too, 
because they all have revolu- 
tionary periods equal to their 
rotational periods.

££ PACE life expectancy has

of a full month.” 



Millions of miles from Earth, 
Ethan also looked discontentedly 
proud. “A mighty healthy dock- 
ing boy," he declared.

ship until it snapped. “It’s some-

thing. You’re gaining on the he- 
redity block. What’s the chief 
factor?” 

“Anti-radiation clothing. We 
just can’t make them effective 
enough.” 



Across space, on distant Mars, 
Amantha reached tor the picture. 
“ How can you tell he ain't 
sickly? You can't see without 
glasses.” 

Ethan reared up. “ Jimmy’s

boy, ain't he? Our kids were 
always healthy, 'specially the 
youngest. Stands to reason their 
kids will be better." 

“ Now you’re thinking with 
your forgettery. They were all 
sick, one time or another. It was 
me who took care of them, 
though. You always could find 
ways of getting out of it.” Aman- 
tha touched the chair switch. 

The planets whirled around the 
Sun. Earth crept ahead of Mars, 
Venus gained on Earth. The flow 
of ships slackened or spurted 
forth anew, according to what 
destination could be reached at 
the moment: 

“A month helps,” said Dema- 
rest. “But where does it end? 
You can’t enclose a man com- 
pletely, and even if you do, there 
still is the air he breathes and 
food he eats. Radiation in space 
contaminates everything the body 
needs. And part of the radioac- 
tivity finds its way to the repro- 
ductive system.” 

M ARLOWE didn’t need to 
glance at the charts; the 
curve was beginning to flatten. 
Mathematically, it was determin- 
able when it wouldn’t rise at all. 
According to analysis, Man 
someday might be able to en- 
dure the radiation encountered 
in space as long as three years, if 
exposure times were spaced at 
intervals. 



But that was in the future. 
“There’s a lot you could do,” 
he told Demarest. “Shield the 
atomics.” 

“Working on it,” commented 
Demarest. “But every ounce we 
add cuts down on the payload. 
The best way is to get the ship 
from one place to another faster. 
It’s time in space that hurts. Less 
exposure time, more trips before 
the crew has to retire. It adds up 
to the same thing.” 

On Mars, Amantha fondled the 
picture. “Pretty. But it ain’t 
real.” She laid it aside. 

Ethan squinted at it. “I could 
make you think it was. Get it 
enlarged, solidified. Have them 
make it soft, big as a baby. You 
could hold it in your lap.” 

“Outgrew playthings years 
ago.” Amantha adjusted the 
chair switch, but the rocking mo- 
tion was no comfort. 

Ethan turned the picture over, 
face down. “Nope. Hate to back 
you up, 'Mantha, but it ain't the 
same. There's nothing like a 
baby, wettin ' and squallin’ and 
smilin’, stubborn when it ought- 
n't to be and sweet and gentle 
when you don’t expect it. Robo- 
dolls don't fool anybody who’s 
ever held the real thing.” 

In the interval, Earth had 
drawn ahead. The gap between 
the two planets was widening. 

“That’s another fallacy,” ob- 
jected the training director. “The 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



body can stand just so much ac- 
celeration. We’re near the limit. 
What good are faster ships?” 
“That’s your problem,” said 
Demarest. “Get me tougher 
crewmen. Young, afraid of noth- 
ing, able to take it.” 

It always ended here — younger, 
tougher, the finest the race pro- 
duced — and still not good enough. 
And after years of training, they 
had twenty-five months to func- 
tion as spacemen. It was a pre- 
cious thing, flight time, and each 
trip was as short as science could 
make it. Conjunction was the 
magic moment for those who 
went between the planets. 

It was the heredity block that 
kept Man squeezed, confined to 
Earth, Mars and Venus, prevent- 
ing him from ranging farther. 
The heredity block was a racial 
quantity, the germ plasm, but not 
just that. Crew and passengers 
were protected as much as pos- 
sible from radiation encountered 
in space and that which origi- 
nated in the ship’s drive. The 
protection wasn’t good enough. 
Prolonged exposure had the usual 
effects, sterilization or the pro- 
duction of deformed mutations. 

Man was the product of evo- 
lution on a planet. He didn’t step 
out into space without payment. 

T HE radiation that damaged 
genes and chromosomes and 
tinier divisions also struck nerve 



cells. Any atom might be hit, 
blazing, into fission and decaying 
into other elements. The process 
was complicated. The results 
were not: the nerve was directly 
stimulated, producing aural and 
visual hallucinations. 

Normally, the hallucination 
was blanked out. But as the level 
of body radioactivity increased, 
so did the strength of the vision. 
It dominated consciousness. The 
outside world ceased to have 
meaning. 

The hallucination took only 
one form, a beautiful woman out- 
side the ship, unclad and beckon- 
ing. 

It was the image of vanished 
fertility that appeared once the 
person was incapable of repro- 
ducing as a human. 

Why this was so hadn’t been 
determined. Psychologists had 
investigated and learned only 
that it invariably occurred after 
too great exposure. There was 
another thing they learned. No, 
that had come first. This was the 
reason they had investigated. 

In the Solar System, the great- 
est single source of radiation, in- 
cluding the hard rays, was the 
Sun. It was natural that the siren 
image should seem stronger in 
that direction, that it should fade 
or retreat toward its origin. No 
one had ever returned from com- 
pulsive pursuit of the illusionary 
woman, though in early days ra- 



THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE HOME 



57 



dio contact had been made with 
ships racing toward the Sun. 

The heredity block was self- 
enforcing. 

Deviously, the race protected 
itself, or something higher watch- 
ed over it to assure human con- 
tinuity. Marlowe wasn’t sure 
which, but it was there. 

“I think you’re on the wrong 
track,” he said. “Shield the ship 
completely and it won’t matter 
how long the trip takes. The 
crew can work in safety.” 

Demarest grunted. “Some day 
we’ll have an inertia-free drive 
and it won’t matter how much 
mass we use. It does now. Our 
designs are a compromise. Both 
of us have to work with what’s 
possible, not what we dream of. 
I’ll build my ship; you find the 
right crew to man it.” 

Marlowe went back to his 
graphs. Machines could be 
changed, but the human body 
clung stubbornly to the old pat- 
terns. He couldn’t select his crews 
any younger — but was there per- 
haps a racial type more resistant 
to radiation? Where? No place 
that he knew of. Maybe the bi- 
ologists could produce one, he 
thought hopefully, and knew he 
was fooling himself. Human be- 
ings weren’t fruit flies ; by the 
time enough generations rolled 
around for the resistant strain to 
breed true — and leave a surplus 
to man the ships — he would be 



long dead and the problem 
solved. 

The best of humanity would 
be dead, too, wiped out by steri- 
lization. 

Or the Solar System would be 
peopled by mutant monstrosities. 

TT'AR away, and not concerned 
with the problem, Ethan 
shrugged resignedly. “Guess we’ll 
have to get used to the idea — we 
just won’t see him till he grows 
up — if we’ll still be around.” 
“You’ve got years and years 
ahead of you, and not worth a 
thing the whole time!” Amantha 
snapped. 

“Damnation,” said Ethan wist- 
fully, “I’d like to dandle him.” 
“Won’t be the same when he 
grows up and comes here,” 
Amantha conceded. “There I go 
agreein’ with you! What’s got 
into me?” 

“Maybe we can get on the next 
slow ship. They run them once 
in a while for people with weak 
hearts.” He considered. “Don’t 
know whether Retired Citizens’ 
Home will let us go, though.” 
“Retired Citizens!” She blew 
her nose scornfully. “They think 
we don’t know it’s just a home for 
the aged!” She threw away the 
tissue. “Think they’ll let us?” 

“It won’t be them so much 
that’ll stop us. Our hearts ain’t 
too good and we haven’t got 
much space time to use. We 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



shouldn’t have gone to Venus.” 
“We had to see Edith and Ed 
and their kids and we had to 
come back to Mars so we could 
be near John and Pearl and Ray. 
Let’s not regret what we’ve 
done.” She picked at the chair 
arm. “We’ve been here a long 
time, ain’t we?” 

Ethan nodded. 

“Maybe they’ve forgotten we’ve 
only got a month left,” she said 
eagerly. 

“You sure it’s a month?” 
“Figure it out. It took longer 
when we went.” 

“Then it’s no use. A slow ship 
. is all we’d be allowed to take — 
and we wouldn’t be allowed be- 
cause it’d be more than a month.” 
“They won’t remember every 
last minute we spent in space.” 
“They will, too,” he stated. 
“They’ve got records.” 

“Maybe they lost them.” 
“Look, we’ve got kids and 
grandchildren here. They come 
around and see us. Do we have 
to *go to Earth, ’specially when 
it’d be against the law?” 

“That’s just it,” she argued. 
“We’ve seen all our other kids’ 
kids. Ain’t we going to see the 
youngest? How do we know his 
wife can take care of a baby? I 
can’t sleep nights, thinking of it.” 
“Try catnaps during the day, 
like I do.” 

Amantha touched the button 
and the automatic chair stopped 



abruptly. “Are you going to try 
to get tickets or aren’t you?” 

“I’ll think about it. Go ahead 
and rock.” 

“I won’t,” she said obstinately, 
“not even if it was the kind of 
chair you can rock yourself. I 
thought I married a man who’d 
make me happy.” 

“I’ve always done my best. Go 
ahead and rock.” 

“But will you try to get the 
tickets?” 

Ethan nodded resignedly and 
felt better when the chair began 
to swing back and forth. There 
was no living with a woman when 
she didn’t have peace of mind. 

A MANTHA lay in bed, listen- 
ing. Sometimes her hearing 
was very good, the way it used 
to be. Other times, it wasn’t worth 
a thing. The way it came and 
went reminded her of when she 
was young and used to wonder 
why old folks couldn’t hear. Now 
she could often lie next to Ethan 
and not even notice whether he 
was snoring. Tonight her hearing 
was good. 

Footsteps came from the hall, 
creaky noises of someone trying 
not to make a sound. She’d lain 
awake many nights, hearing him 
come home. She knew who it was 
and for once she didn’t mind. 
The Home for Retired Citizens 
had rules. 

Careful, she thought. There’s

the bad spot where the floor’s 
thin and bends when you step 
on it. Then when your foot comes 
off it. it goes ploinnnnng. They 
don’t build right any more. 
Skimping and trying to save. 

But there wasn’t a sound. 
Ethan avoided it. When she 
thought of it, she realized he had 
a suspicious amount of skill — the 
skill of practice. 

Ethan was fumbling at the 
door and she forgot her irrita- 
tion. She slipped out of bed and 
swung the door open. He stum- 
bled in against her. “ ’Mantha, 
they laughed — ” 

“Did you have anything to 
eat?” she broke in. 

“Cup of that Mars coffee. 
But — ” 

“Don’t talk till you get some- 
thing hot inside. Empty belly, 
empty head.” 

“Can’t eat stuff that comes out 
of the wall. I’ll wait till break- 
fast.” 

She flicked the light on low 
and punched the selector. She 
took the glow-plate from under 
the bed and set it on the table. 
As the food arrived, she heated 
it and began adding spices. 
“There — it ain’t real food, but 
you can pretend.” 

Ethan pretended and, when the 
food was gone, wiped his lips and 
looked at her. 

She nodded. “Now you can 
tell me — but keep your voice 



low. Don’t wake anyone up.” 
Ethan stretched and creaked. 
“Went down to the Interplanet 
office and they wouldn’t talk to 
me. Said there wasn’t any ship 
leaving for the next ten months 
and they didn’t sell tickets in ad- 
vance. I kept pestering them and 
they got mad. They looked up 
our records and said we couldn’t 
go anytime, except on a fast ship, 
and, considering our age, it was 
doubtful they’d let us. Didn’t 
give up, though, and finally they 
said we might get a release from 
the man who’d take us. Maybe 
they wanted to get rid of me. 
Anyway, they sent me down to 
talk with one of the pilots.” 

A MANTHA approved. Go 
straight to the man respon- 
sible. Persistence could get you 
there. 

“He talked real nice for a 
while,” Ethan continued. “He ex- 
plained he didn’t own the ship 
and didn’t have the say-so who 
he took. I knew you wanted to 
go real bad. I offered him the 
money we’d saved.” 

“ All of it, Ethan?” 

“Don’t get mad. Figured it 
was worth it to you.” 

“Don’t believe in paying ex- 
tra,” she mused, “but did you 
tell him we could borrow some 
if it wasn’t enough?” 

“Didn’t get a chance. He start- 
ed laughing, saying didn’t I un-

derstand he got paid not just for 
each trip, but for all the years 
after that, when he was finished 
and had used up his time and 
couldn’t work at the only thing 
he knew? Saying that he wouldn’t 
risk that kind of security for any 
money and I was an idiot for be- 
lieving he might.” Ethan trem- 
bled. 

“Never mind. He’s an old fool.” 
“He’s younger than Jimmy.” 
“Some people get wisdom when 
they’re young.” 

Ethan sat morosely in the 
chair. “If Jimmy hadn’t made 
that last trip, he’d be here and 
he’d have married a girl here 
and his kids would be here. We 
wouldn’t have to worry about 
them.” 

“I guess so, but he was lucky 
anyway. They found out he 
wasn’t as strong as he was sup- 
posed to be and wouldn’t Jet 
him come back.” She began clear- 
ing the dishes. “How’d they know 
he couldn’t come back?” 

“They got tests. They give 
them each trip.” 

She should have thought of it. 
They had tests. Because of tests, 
Jimmy was safe but distant. She 
sat down. 

“Tired.” Ethan yawned. “Let’s 
go to bed.” 

“You go. I’m thinking.” 
Amantha went on thinking 
while he undressed and lay down. 
Sometimes it was difficult — things 



weren’t as clear as they used to 
be. Tonight, though, she had no 
trouble managing her mind. A 
woman who had kids had to 
know her way around things. 
Presently, she said, “Tomorrow 
I'm going to bake.” 

Ethan stirred. “Won’t do no 
good. Didn’t say so, but there 
was a girl talking to the pilot 
when I got there. She was crying 
and begging him to take her to 
Earth next trip. Said she’d do 
anything if he would.” 

“Shame on her!” exclaimed 
Amantha. “But did it work?” 
“She was young and pretty and 
still he wouldn’t pay attention to 
her,” said Ethan. “What chance 
would you have?” 

“I’m going to bake tomorrow. 
In the morning, we’re supposed 
to go for a walk. We’ll take a big 
basket. Do you remember the old 
canal nobody goes near any 
more?” 

There was no answer. Ethan 
was asleep. Now that she’d de- 
cided what to do, she lay down 
beside him. 

T HE sentry huddled in his post. 

It was insulated and supplied 
with oxygen, very much like a 
spacesuit. Though big for a space- 
suit, it was a small place to spend 
hours in without relief. But there 
were compensations: never any- 
thing to do— except as now. He 
went to the mike. 



THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE HOME

“Get back,” he shouted. 

They paid no attention. 

Swearing, he shouted again, 
turning up the volume. Even in 
the thin air, he had enough sound 
to blast them off their feet. But 
they kept on going. He poked the 
snout of his weapon through the 
porthole and then withdrew it. 
Who’d given him those orders 
anyway? He didn’t have to obey 
them. He clamped on his oxygen 
helmet and slipped into electric 
mitts and hurried outside. 

“Where do you think you’re go- 
ing?” he demanded, standing in 
front of them. 

“Hello,” said Amantha. “Didn’t 
see anyone around.” 

Damn senior citizens — they 
never used hearing aids. “You’ve 
got to turn around and go back,” 
he said. 

“Why?” 

He was shivering and didn’t see 
how they could stand it. Thin 
clothing and obsolete oxygen 
equipment. Oddly, they could 
take more than you’d think, 
though. Used to it, he supposed. 
“Come on in,” he commanded 
gruffly. He wasn’t going to freeze. 
They followed him into the post. 
“Didn’t you see the signs to keep 
out?” 

“But the ships aren’t using the 
field. What harm are we doing?” 

“Orders,” he said. There were 
still a few pilots checking over 
their ships, making sure every- 



thing was in working condition 
before they were locked up. In 
a week, all flight personnel would 
be gone to the settlements, there 
to await the next round of voy- 
ages when Earth came near. They 
had it soft, while he, the guard, 
had to stay in cold discomfort. 

“We’re going to visit a friend 
of my son,” said Amantha. 
“They were pilots together. Do 
you object?” 

He didn’t, but there were some 
who would. The order made 
sense with respect to little boys 
who would otherwise swarm over 




62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the field, falling off ships or get- 
ting stuck in rocket tubes. 

“What have you got?” he ask- 
ed, eying Amantha's parcel dubi- 
ously. 

“I baked something.” She open- 
ed a comer of the package and 
the smell drifted out. “Made it 
with Martian fruit. Not much of 
it around these days.” 




THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE HOME 



63 



He sniffed and became hungry. 
That was queer — he’d eaten be- 
fore coming on duty. 

“Okay,” he said. “You can go. 
Don’t get caught or it’s my neck.” 
He stood closer to the old man 
and woman, and the package, 
too, and pointed out the window. 
“Act like you’re leaving in case 
anyone’s checking up. When you 
get near the line of ships, duck 
behind them and walk along un- 
til you find the right one. No one 
will see you except me.” 

Amantha pinched the package 
together. “I’d give you some, but 
I can’t cut it before the pilot sees 
it.” 

“I guess you can’t,” said the 
sentry wistfully. “Maybe he won’t 
eat all of it.” 

“May he won’t. I’ll bring you 
back what’s left — if there is any 
left.” 

Long after they were gone, the 
sentry stood there, trying to 
analyze the indefinable odor. He 
was still standing there when the 
checkup squad marched in and 
arrested him for gross dereliction 
of duty. 

O away,” said the pilot, dis- 
appearing from the viewport. 
Ethan pounded on the hull with 
a rock. The pilot came back, 
twisting his face. “Stop it. I’ll 
angle the rocket tubes around and 
squirt you with them.” 

Ethan raised the rock. 



“Okay,” said the pilot. “I’ll 
talk to you, though I know what 
you want.” Sullenly, he made the 
hatch swing open. He looked 
down at them. “All right, let’s 
hear it.” 

“Got a present for you,” said 
Ethan. 

“Not allowed to take bribes un- 
less it’s money.” 

“Young man, where are your 
manners?” snapped Amantha. 

“Haven’t got any. It’s the first 
thing they train out of you.” The 
pilot started to jerk his head 
back, saw the rock and decided 
not to close the hatch. He glanced 
at the narrow ladder to the 
ground. .“I'll take your present. 
Bring it up.” 

He stopped smirking as Aman- 
tha hitched up her skirts and, 
holding the package in one hand, 
swung up the ladder. Agile as 
goats and probably as sensible, 
he thought. He took hold of her 
as she neared the top. 

“Grandma, you’re too old to 
climb around. You’ll break every 
brittle bone in your body if you 
fall.” 

“Ain’t so brittle,” said Aman- 
tha, making way for Ethan who 
had followed her. “My, it’s cold!” 
She began shivering. “Invite us in 
to get warm.” 

“You can’t go in. I’m busy. 
Hey, wait!” The pilot hurried af- 
ter her into the control compart- 
ment.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Amantha was looking around 
when he arrived. “Cozy but kind 
of bare,” she said. “Why don’t 
you hang up pictures?” 

“Most fabulous pictures you’ll 
ever see are right there.” 

Amantha followed his glance. 
“Nothing but Mars. I can see that 
every day.” She puzzled over it. 
“Oh, you’re teasing an old wo- 
man. I didn’t mean what you see 
out of the port, stars and planets 
and such. I’d want a picture of 
an Indian settin’ on a horse.” 
“I’ll bet!” muttered the pilot. 
“Get warm in a hurry. I’ve got 
work to do.” 

“You just go ahead,” she said. 
“We’ll set here and toast our 
toes. We don’t aim to interfere.” 
“I’ll stay,” said the pilot has- 
tily. “Let’s have the present.” 
He’d made a tactical error — he 
should have ignored the noise that 
went shimmering through the hull 
when the old man had pounded 
with a rock. No, it was nice to 
think he could have, but impos- 
sible. Patience was one of the 
things the aged did have and 
the young didn’t. 

Amantha set the package 
down. The pilot scrambled ahead 
of her and got the navigator’s 
instruments off the desk and into 
the drawer. 

She opened and displayed the 
contents. 

“I baked it for you,” she said. 
“It’s a cake.” 



TTE could see what it was. 
-■■■■- “Hate cake,” he said. “Can’t 
eat it.” 

“You’ll eat this. Canalberry 
shortcake.” 

“Canalberry?” he asked, wrink- 
ling his face. He smelled it and 
changed expressions in the middle 
of a wrinkle. Resolutely, he turn- 
ed away from it and saw Ethan 
clearly, perhaps for the first time. 
It was the old man who had tried 
to bribe him a few days ago. They 
weren’t as innocent as they seem- 
ed. What were they trying to do? 

“Ain’t you even going to taste 
it?” she urged. 

He shuddered suspiciously. It 
smelled good, though he had told 
the truth about hating the stuff. 
Under other circumstances, he 
might have nibbled at a piece for 
politeness’ sake. 

“Can’t. Doctor’s orders.” 

“Diabetic? Didn’t think they 
let them in space-service,” said 
Amantha. “Funny, it’s the same 
with Ethan. He can’t eat sweets, 
either.” She looked at her crea- 
tion. “Seems a shame to bring it 
so far to somebody who can’t 
touch it. Do you mind if I cut 
myself a slice?” 

“Go ahead, Grandma.” 

“Amantha,” she corrected him 
and brought out a knife and two 
small plates. He wondered if there 
was any significance. Two plates. 

She laid a slice on the plate 
and poked at it with a fork that 



THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE HOME 



65 



was also in the package. She put 
the fork down and picked up the 
cake. 

“It don’t taste right unless you 
eat it the way it was meant to 
be,” she said. 

He watched her in anguish. 
His nose quivered and his stom- 
ach rumbled. He shouldn’t have 
let them in. 

A crumb fell to the floor and 
Amantha reached for it. She 
straightened up, a berry in her 
hand. 

“Canalberries,” she said. 
“They’re nearly all gone. Used 
to be you could hardly go any- 
where without stepping in them.” 

She crushed the berry and the 
rich aroma swept devastatingly 
through the air. 

“Sure you won’t have some?” 
she asked, slicing the cake and 
placing it in front of him. When 
he finished that, he cut another, 
and another, until the cake was 
gone. 

The pilot settled logily in a 
chair and dozed off. Amantha 
and Ethan watched him in 
silence. 

The pilot got up and began 
to stretch lazily without seeming 
to notice them. The laziness dis- 
appeared and the stretch changed 
into a jerk that seemed to elon- 
gate his body. He sprang out of 
the compartment and went leap- 
ing down the corridor. When he 
came to the hatch, he didn’t hesi- 



tate. The ladder was too slow. 
He jumped. 

He landed on the sand, sink- 
ing in to his knees. He extricated 
himself and went bounding over 
the field. 

“Never saw Canalberries take so 
long,” muttered Amantha. “Don’t 
know what’s wrong. Nothing’s as 
good as it used to be.” 

She shook off her hat and clos- 
ed the airlock. 

“You don’t need those nose 
plugs any more, Ethan. Come on, 
let’s see if you remember.” 

OEVERAL hours later, she 
^ twirled unfamiliar knobs and, 
by persistence and beginner’s 
luck, managed to get the person 
she wanted. 

“You the commander?” Since 
he had a harassed look, she as- 
sumed he was. “Thought you 
might be worried about that poor 
boy.” 

“Madam, what do you want?” 
He scowled at the offscreen 
miscreant who had mistakenly 
summoned him. “I’m chasing 
criminals. I haven’t got time to 
chat about old times.” 

“Don’t sass me. I thought you 
might want to know how to stop 
that poor boy from running 
around.” 

The commander sat down. 
“What young man?” he asked 
calculatingly. 

“Don’t know his name,” said 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Amantha. “He ran out of the ship 
before we could ask him.” 

“So you're the poisoner,” said 
the commander coldly. “If he 
dies, neither your age nor your 
sex will make any difference.” 
“Just canalberries,” Amantha 
assured him. “Reckon you 
wouldn’t know about them.” 
“What are you talking about?” 
“Canalberries. Used to be lots 
of them. Males, men and animals, 
just can’t help eating them. Don’t 
bother women or any other kind 
of females. Biologists used to tell 
us it was a seed -scattering device. 
Guess so. Won’t hurt him none. 
Try bicarb and vinegar^ It’ll fix 
him up.” 

“For your sake, I hope it 
will!” said the commander. “He’s 
in a bad way.” He stabbed a pen- 
cil at her and his voice became 
stern. “If you follow directions, 
I’m sure I can get you off light- 
ly" 

“Think we will?” said Aman- 
tha. 

The commander hurried on. 
“It’s hard to find a ship in space. 
Stay where you are or, if you can, 
turn around and come back — 
slowly. We’ll send a ship up and 
transfer a competent pilot to 
bring you down. Do you hear?” 
“Real plain. You got good 
radios on these ships.” 

He smothered a growl. “Your 
lives are in danger. We’re not 
going to chase out and rescue you 



unless you cooperate.” It was an 
understatement. If they observed 
radio silence, search ships would 
never find them. They might not 
think of it, but he wouldn’t bet. 
They were smart enough to steal 
the ship. 

There was another thing. From 
what he’d learned from records, 
they were close to the exposure 
limit. Any moment now, they 
might go berserk, turning their 
course fatally toward the Sun. 
He had to be careful what he 
said. 

“We’ll get you out of this, but 
only if you help. I refuse to sacri- 
fice men and waste their flight 
time, which is more precious than 
any ship, merely to save two 
senile incompetents. Is this 
clear?” 

“I suppose,” said Amantha. 
“We’ve got to go home.” 

The commander rubbed his 
hands. They weren’t as stubborn 
as he feared. He’d rescue them. 

“Good. I’ll have men aloft in 
a few minutes.” 

“Guess it was you who didn’t 
hear,” she said. “Our home is 
on Earth.” 

II 

“rpiHERE’S no one here,” said 
the robot blocking the door. 

“We’ll wait.” Amantha tried 
to go inside. The robot wouldn’t 
move. 



THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE HOME 



67 



It was dark and windy and, 
from the steps, they could see 
lights of houses glowing around 
them. Not many — it was near 
the edge of the little town. Far- 
ther away, over the hill, the ship 
nestled safely in a valley. No one 
had seen them land. They were 
sure of it. 

Ethan removed his hat and his 
bent shoulders straightened. He 
seemed to grow taller. 

“Rain,” he said in awe. “Thir- 
ty years and yet I haven’t for- 
gotten what it’s like.” 

“It’s wet, that’s what it’s like,” 
said Amantha. “Robot, let us in 
or I’ll have Ethan take a wrench 
to you. He loves to tinker.” 

“I can’t be threatened. My sole 
concern is the welfare of my 
charge. Also, I’m too large for 
any human to hurt me.” 

“Damnation, I’m soppin’!” 
complained Ethan. “It’s better to 
remember the rain than to be in 
it.” 

“Wait till my son Jimmy gets 
back. He’ll be ravin’. Makin’ us 
stay out here and get soaked.” 
“Son? Is the Jimmy you refer 
to Pilot James Huntley?” 
“Ex-pilot.” 

“Correct. But he’s not at home. 
He took his wife to the hospital 
half an hour ago.” 

"So soon?” gasped Amantha. 
“Thought I taught him better 
than that. Women have got to 
rest between kids.” 



“It’s not another child.” said 
the robot with disinterest. “It has 
to do with one of the ills flesh is 
heir to and machines are not. 
Nothing serious.” 

Ethan fidgeted, turning up his 
collar. Water began flowing from 
the eaves. “Stop arguin’ and let 
us in. Jimmy will turn off your 
juice when he finds you’ve kept 
his folks outside.” 

“Folks? He has none here. A 
mother and father living happily 
on Mars. They died quite recent- 
ly, lost in space and plunging 
into the Sun.” 

“Make up your mind,” Aman- 
tha said peevishly. “We ain’t on 
Mars, we weren’t happy and we 
didn’t get lost and plunge into 
the Sun.” 

“I merely repeat — in sequence 
— the information I’m given or 
overhear. If it’s inconsistent, so 
are humans. I’m used to it.” 

“ ’Mantha, they think we’re 
dead,” said Ethan. He wiped a 
raindrop away. “Poor Jimmy!” 
A thin wail came from a crack 
in the door. The robot’s eyes 
shone briefly, then dimmed. 

“What’s that?” asked Aman- 
tha. “Sounds like a baby. 
Thought you said no one was 
home.” 

“No responsible adult. Only a 
child. Because of that, I can ad- 
mit no one except the parents — 
or a doctor if I decide one is 
needed.” The robot whirred and 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



drew itself up. “He’s absolutely 
safe. I’m a Sitta.” 

“You sure are. Now get out of 
my way before I jab you. The 
kid’s crying.” 

“He is, but it’s no concern of 
yours. I’m better acquainted with 
infant behavior than any human 
can be. The pathetic sob merely 
means that the child wants at- 
tention. I was given no instruc- 
tions to hold him.” 

A GAIN the child cried. “Who 
-**- needs to be told?” demanded 
Amantha. “Nobody gives grand- 
mothers instructions.” 

“He’s got a grandfather to cud- 
dle him,” added Ethan. “How far 
do you think we came to do it?” 
“And he’s not cry in’ because 
he wants attention. Something’s 
stickin’ him and he’s hungry. 
Don’t you think a grandmother 
would know?” 

“There’s nothing that can stick 
him, but if, by accident, some- 
thing sharp had gotten in his 
bed and if he were also hungry, 
he would sound like this.” The 
Sitta hunched down and swiveled 
its head, giving an imitation. 
“You see? I do nothing but watch 
babies. It’s built info me.” 
Inside the house, the child’s 
tone changed, became querulous, 
listening. Interrogatively, it of- 
fered a single yowl. 

“My analysis was correct. It 
wanted attention. The parents 



left so hurriedly, they forgot to 
give me permission. When I didn’t 
come to investigate, the child 
stop — ” 

The wail burst forth with re- 
newed vigor. 

The robot rotated its head and 
the alert look flashed on and off. 
It stuttered, “I know w-what I’m 
doing. But I — I can tell only 
what has happened to my charge, 
n-never what will!" The Sitta 
rumbled bewilderedly. “Anticipa- 
tion is beyond my capacity. The 
child is hurt and hungry. Please 
come in and help me.” 

Triumphantly, Amantha fol- 
lowed the robot into the house 
toward the nursery. She whisper- 
ed to Ethan, “Sittas ain’t smart. 
I reckon he never heard a bunch 
of babies together. If one cries, 
they all do.” 

The Sitta barred the path. 
“You seem sincere and are ob- 
viously an expert. But before 
you go in, understand this — at- 
tempt no harm to the being in 
there. I’m linked.” 

“You’ll be unlinked if you don’t 
stop acting balky,” warned 
Amantha. She ducked under his 
arm and darted toward the crib. 

“By linked, I mean that if any- 
thing happens that I require aid 
to handle, an alarm rings in Sit- 
tas Circle and help is on the way. 
Meanwhile, I can put out fires 
or carry him unharmed through 
concrete walls.” 



THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE HOME 



69 



“Go ahead, run through a 
wall,” invited Amantha abstract- 
ly, snatching up the child. “The 
darling’s wet, too. Fetch me a 
diaper.” 

The robot fetched at her com- 
mand. And when the child was 
quiet, even cooing, but with a 
sharp undertone of protest, 
Amantha settled back. “Now 
we’ve got to feed him.” 

“They didn’t give me special 
instructions and I can’t originate. 
If you hadn’t come. I’d have had 
to contact a doctor.” 

Amantha handed the child to 
Ethan. “You hold him.” She went 
into the kitchen. 

Ethan tossed the child up. 
“Here we go,” he bellowed. “Free 
fall. Got to start early to make a 
spaceman out of y6u.” The Sit- 
ta stared at them, puzzled, as 
the infant shrieked with fear or 
joy. “Now if only Jimmy was 
here to see us,” said Ethan, grin- 
ning proudly. 

Jimmy didn’t come back soon 
enough. The police arrived first. 

E THAN wandered to the win- 
dow. The ground was far be- 
low. He didn’t want to think of 
what was outside the door. 

“Don’t mind jail myself — been 
in a few.” He looked at Amantha. 
“Just for raising hell. Never 
thought I’d be responsible for 
putting you behind bars.” 

“It wasn’t you,” said Amantha, 



her back straightening. “Curious 
about it myself.” Wisps of hair 
straggled over her face. “I mean 
why didn’t we think of it on 
Mars? Didn’t we know what 
they’d do?” 

“I guess we didn’t.” Ethan 
cracked his knuckles contempla- 
tively. “Did it occur to you?” 
“No. I can’t understand.” She 
frowned, but it didn’t help clarify 
what she was thinking about. 

“We’re criminals,” said Ethan 
soberly. “Thieves.” 

“I don’t mind for us. Jail’s 
not much worse than the home 
for Retired Citizens. It’s our 
grandson I’m thinking of.” 
“Don’t worry. They won’t do 
a thing to him.” His eyes widen- 
ed and he wiped off the sweat. 
“Oh. I see what you mean.” 
“Jailbirds,” said Amantha. 
“We’ll still be in here when he 
grows up. It’s a fine way to help 
your kin. They’ll never trust him 
with us in his family.” 

“Jailbirds,” repeated Ethan 
mournfully. By some magic, his 
face cracked along the wrinkles 
and broke into a smile. “But once 
we flew,” he whispered to him- 
self. 

The door opened and an official 
of some sort came in. Outside, 
Ethan caught a brief glimpse of 
guards. 

Marlowe, chief training direc- 
tor of space pilots for Inter- 
planet Transport, Inc., walked in 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



silence across the room and eased 
tiredly into a chair behind the 
desk. He’d gotten the news late 
at night, having been the first 
one contacted. The ship that had 
been lost had showed up in the 
atmosphere. There couldn’t be 
a mistake. No other flight was 
scheduled for months. 

“Follow it,” he had ordered 
and the trackers had kept it on 
the screen, flashing a message to 
the police as soon as they located 
where it landed. It was logical 
that it should go where it did, but 
he didn’t think that anything 
about this flight was susceptible 
to a rational approach. 

Marlowe’s eyelids felt lined 
with sand, but that was as noth- 
ing compared to his mental irri- 
tation. The two oldsters were 
dead and the ship was vaporized 
in the Sun. But, of course, it 
wasn’t true and he had to figure 
out why. 

Others would be here to help 
him unravel the mystery, from 
Demarest on down. Meanwhile, 
he was first. There was a lesson to 
learn if he could figure out what 
it was. Damn these senile in- 
competents. 

“Ethan and Amantha Hunt- 
ley?” he asked. They didn’t fit in 
with his preconceived picture. 

“You the judge?” said Ethan. 
“I demand to see a lawyer. We’ve 
got our rights.” 

“Why don’t you let our son 




THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE

in?” Amantha protested. “I know 
he’s been dying to see us. You 
can’t keep us locked up like this.” 

“Please! I’ve just come from a 
consultation with your son. You’ll 
see him soon. As for being de- 
tained, you’ve keen well treated. 
Most of the time, doctors have 
been examining you. Isn’t that 
true?” 

“What’s that got to do with 
it?” challenged Ethan. “Never 
been sick a day in my life. Sure, 
my back hurts, and now and 
then my knees swell up. But it’s 
nothing. We didn’t ask for a doc- 
tor. Got our own on Mars. Young 
fellow, fifty or sixty.” 

TRACTS contradicted each 
other. They were what Mar- 
lowe expected and yet they 
weren’t. It was hard to determine. 
Records showed that if the old 
couple were not actually senile 
incompetents, they were close to 
it. Now that they’d returned the 
ship in good condition, legal ac- 
tion against them would be 
dangerous. Everyone had grand- 
parents and knew that they were 
sometimes foolish. It was a spot 
to get out of as gracefully as the 
company could. - 

It was as training director for 
Interplanet Transport, however, 
that he was interested in them. 

“You were in space for nearly 
four months,” he said. “Few 
people take that much exposure 



to radiation at one time. We had 
to determine the state of your 
health. The evaluation isn’t com- 
plete, but I think we can say 
you’re in no immediate danger.” 

Did they understand? It was 
doubtful. No one else would have 
stolen the ship and attempted to 
bring it to Earth. But, damn it, 
they had done so, landing the 
ship on the outskirts of the little 
town, unobserved in the gather- 
ing storm. 

The facts were painfully fresh 
in his mind. 

“I’d like to know something of 
your background,” said Marlowe. 
“What’s your experience with 
spaceships?” 

“Went to Venus in one,” Ethan 
answered. “Also took a trip to 
Mars. Stayed there.” 

The old man had haunted the 
control compartment, watching 
how it was done. Some people 
did. But that was not a substi- 
tute for experience. 

“That was long ago and you 
were a passenger. Anything more 
recent?” 

“Nope. Except for this last 
trip.” 

That was what didn’t make 
sense. 

“Are you sure? Be honest. 
Check your memory.” 

The old man had once piloted 
jets. But it was not the same. 

“No other experience,” said 
Ethan. “Had training, though.”

Marlowe knew it. Without 
training, no one could manage 
takeoff and landing. Somehow, 
the official search had failed to 
uncover this vital information. 
“Where did you take it?” 

“Forget the name. Remember 
every word of it, though.” 

Marlowe nodded. It was often 
the case. Early memories were 
fresh and clear while later events 
blew over the enfeebled mind and 
left no trace. “But you didn’t 
tell me where.” 

“Don’t remember that part of 
it. It was a mighty good course. 
Wasn’t accepted, even though I 
passed, after paying for my les- 
sons in advance. They said I was 
too old.” 

Air lodged in his throat — Mar- 
lowe doubled over. If he’d heard 
rightly . Good God, there were 
angels and correspondence cours- 
es that watched over the aged! 
No — give the credit to angels. 

“I realized I wasn’t as spry as 
I used to be,” continued Ethan 
seriously. “Can’t shoot off a 
planet or slam down on one the 
way your pilots do. We were at 
the far end of the field, quite a 
ways off. Everybody was busy 
with the pilot who was running 
around. They were trying to help 
him. 

“Guess they didn’t see us. 
They’d have laughed if they did. 
We went up slow, kind of wob- 
bly. But we got off.” 



T'HE old man was beaming, 
proud of it. He didn’t know 
it wasn’t skill but the built-in 
safety factor, all the stabilizing 
mechanisms corrfing into play 
at once. Demarest, the chief of 
construction, had seen to it that 
the ships were well designed. 
Marlowe would have to commend 
him when he got here. 

A thought occurred to the 
training director. If the stabiliz- 
ing mechanisms were there, why 
not use them always? Of course, 
it wasn't that simple. Inter- 
planetary ship stabilizers weren’t 
effective at high speed. 

Another thought crowded in. 
Why such high speed? That was 
something over which there was 
no choice. The protective atmos- 
phere had to be left swiftly. The 
speed was added to at every op- 
portunity. It was possible to 
slow down only at the last mo- 
ment. Otherwise . 

Otherwise what? 

There was no escape from the 
conclusion — otherwise heredity 
was altered and mutations would 
result. Marlowe sat back. This 
was true without exception. It 
was the biggest factor that con- 
trolled the conditions of inter- 
planetary flight. But — 

They'd had their children! 

Marlowe’s pulse increased. As 
training director, he’d learned 
not to leap at things that merely 
looked good. He had to examine 



THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE HOME 



73 



them carefully. But — well, it was 
a new approach, though he 
couldn’t really expect anything 
from it. There was more to a 
crew than a pilot, more to space 
flight than one incredible lucky 
voyage, for angels took vacations, 
too. 

“You weren’t on duty at all 
times,” Marlowe pointed out. 
“Then there’s navigation.” 

“Don’t sleep much,” said 
Ethan. “Catnap once in a while.” 
He thought it over. “When I did 
sleep, ’Mantha helped out.” He 
looked at her. “I’m not the ex- 
pert on navigation. You’d better 
ask her.” 

“No!” cried Marlowe. 

“Why not? Just because I’m 
a woman?” Her eyes were bright. 

“But who taught you navi- 
gation?” 

Amantha sniffed. “Look here, 
young man, don’t tell me what I 
can learn.” She closed her eyes 
and imagination carried her back 
to the ship. “Lots of dials and 
gadgets — but I used to have near 
as many in my kitchen before 
they said I was too old to cook. 
Anyway, you don’t have to figure 
it out on paper. If you look at 
things just right, you sort of 
know where you are.” 

A MANTHA folded her hands. 

“First, you take a big hand- 
ful of the Sun’s attraction and 
mix it with a bigger scoop of the 



gravitation of the planet you hap- 
pen to be on. For us, that was 
Mars. Then you add a pinch of 
acceleration. That’s what makes 
you rise. When you get out a 
ways, you decrease Mars and add 
more Earth and another pinch 
of Sun, stirring it around in your 
mind each day until it feels just 
right.” 

She smiled. “I never did hold 
with too much measuring.” 

The muscles in Marlowe’s 
chest felt cramped from holding 
his breath in. While she spoke, 
he could almost believe she knew 
what she was doing, that she had 
a knack for it. Perhaps she did — 
brief flashes of clarity swept over 
her senile, beclouded mind. And 
the same with the old man. These 
instances of sanity — and luck — 
had pulled them through. 

The ship was back, unharmed. 
He shouldn’t ask for more. And 
yet — they had made it to Earth. 

The chute in the desk clat- 
tered noisily and ejected a pack- 
et. Marlowe looked at it — it was 
for him. The full medical report; 
it had been slow in coming. But 
this was a small town. The doctor 
who had looked them over was 
good, though. Marlowe made cer- 
tain of that. 

He opened the report and 
read. When he finished, he knew 
that though luck and angels had 
been with them on takeoff and 
part of the passage — along with 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dimly remembered fragments of 
unrelated skills that had some- 
how coalesced into a working 
knowledge of how to run a ship — 
it wasn’t the whole story. When 
they landed on Earth, it was no 
miracle. They had known what 
they were doing. 

“What is it?” asked Ethan. 
“Habeas corpus?” 

“No,” said Marlowe. But in 
one sense it was, though of a kind 
that no mere judge could return 
a verdict on. He read the report 
again. 

“No evidence of mental senil- 
ity,” it said in part. “Micro-sam- 
ples of brain cells seem to be 
taken from someone about forty 
or fifty. Physical reactions are 
slow but firm and consistent. 
There are puzzling aspects. Cer- 
tain obscure functions apparently 
are those of septegenarians. 
Others are in keeping with the 
mental age. The weakest organs 
govern, of course; they should 
live another thirty years, as if 
they really were in their seven- 
ties. However, locomotion and 
judgment should not be impaired 
until the very end. Query: Are 
you sure these are the people I 
was supposd to examine? I 
couldn’t find that deep, inoper- 
able, though non-malignant tu- 
mor the man was supposed to 
have.” 

Marlowe folded and refolded 
the report. Radiation could kill. 



But it could also cure. It was a 
standard treatment. But never 
so drastic and not on the aged for 
this purpose. He had come at 
once on two monumental dis- 
coveries. both by accident. How 
many discoveries were accidental? 

These two wouldn’t live long- 
er, but they would have a better 
life and in full possession of their 
senses. 

“Sure, we borrowed — stole the 
ship,” said Ethan abruptly, in- 
terrupting Marlowe’s thoughts. 
“You got it back, but that don’t 
change things. We’ve got money. 
We might have enough to pay 
for most of the fuel.” 

“It’s not necessary. We’ll 
charge it off as an experiment.” 
Marlowe tried to frown. Perhaps 
he succeeded. “In return for not 
prosecuting, I want you to aban- 
don your pension and go to work 
for Interplanet Transport.” 

Ethan’s joints creaked as he 
sat up eagerly. “Work it off? 
Sounds fair.” There were wrinkles 
on his face and there never would 
be any less, but they weren’t as 
deep as they had been, not when 
they formed the network of a 
smile. “I can sweep out a ship. 
Maybe you’d even let me go on 
a trip once in a while. I could be 
a cabin boy.” 

They had been considered use- 
less and incapable for so long 
that they still didn’t realize what 
he was saying. They weren’t 



THE IMPOSSIBLE VOYAGE HOME 



75 



childish, but they thought they 
were. Re-education would have 
to proceed slowly. 

“I had a trip in mind for you,” 
said Marlowe. ‘‘And Amantha 
will have to go to work, too.” 
‘‘Young man, it’s been a long 
time since I cooked anything 
but one canalberry shortcake, 
but you just watch what I can 
stir up.” 

‘‘I’ve got just the place for 
you,” Marlowe answered. “One 
more stipulation — don’t talk 
about your experiences. If re- 
porters come around, and I think 
they will, say merely that we 
traced the ship and, after con- 
ferring with you, decided to drop 
all charges. Understand?” 

Amantha nodded. “Look bad 
for you, wouldn’t it? Not guard- 
ing the ships any better than that, 
I mean.” 

He was thankful their minds 
had merely been resharpened, 
that they would never regain their 
original edge. She was right — it 
would look bad. Also, the com- 
pany had competitors. And by 
the time they got wind of it, he 
wanted to have a head-start. Only 
a few of the aged would fit in 
with his plans, though the rest 
would benefit, and by more than 
a change of status. 

Marlowe nodded. “That’s it. 
Report tomorrow and we’ll go 
over your assignments.” 

“Guess you don’t know what 



we’re like,” said Ethan. “We’ve 
hardly seen our littlest grandson 
yet. What do you suppose we 
stole— experimented with the ship 
for?” 

Marlowe watched them go and, 
as the door closed, began to write 
hurriedly. The others would be 
here soon. He wanted to have it 
summarized by the time they 
arrived. 

Half an hour later, he looked at 
what he’d put down. It was on 
the back of the medical report. 

“Memo: Change the design of 
our lastest ship. Instead of a 
heavy-hulled, superfast rocket, 
requiring the utmost in bodily co- 
ordination and stamina, reverse 
every specification. Permeability 
to radiation no objection.” 

He chuckled. Demarest would 
threaten to resign. It violated 
every precept he had ever learn- 
ed. But the engineer would 
change his mind when he saw 
the rest of it. 

M ARLOWE read on: “Top 
speed need not be high. Em- 
phasis should be placed on safe- 
ty. Must be maneuverable by 
operators whose reactive time is 
not fast, but whose judgment and 
foresight are trustworthy. Stress 
simplicity. 

“Memo No. 2: Inaugurate an- 
other class of service. In addition 
to fast speedy passages when 
planets are close, a freight system

that can operate continuously is 
now possible. The planets will 
open up faster if a steady supply 
route can be maintained. Older 
passengers will be a mainstay, 
especially since therapeutic value 
is sure to be disclosed. Estimated 
time to prepare for first run — 
one year minimum. 

“Memo No. 3: Recruiting. Do 
not overlook the most unlikely 
skill. It may indicate undisclosed 
ability of high order. 

“Training: Blank. Improvise 
as you go along!" 

Marlowe got up. He thought 
he heard planes overhead. If so, 
he had something for them. He’d 
have to argue, but he felt up to it. 
The sand had disappeared from 
his eyes. His step was lighter, too. 

And that was because of an- 
other item he hadn’t written 



down. He wouldn’t forget. 

He was in the mid-forties and 
would have to begin learning. It 
was the awkward age — too old — 
too young. He couldn’t hope to 
pilot the murderously fast ships 
currently in use. And he couldn’t 
take his place in the clumsy tubs 
that would soon be swinging be- 
tween the planets, opening up 
space to commerce. He would 
have to wait, but what he learned 
now would be useful some day. 
It would be better integrated for 
having been long buried in his 
memory. 

A vintage aspiration. 

When he was immune to the 
mutating effects of radiation, old 
and nearly sleepless, he could re- 
tire from this career — into a 
better one.

Earth's only defense against

ship and a grim little crew 
—very grim and very little! 



Illustrated by BECK 



C OLONEL William Faust of 
the Solar Guard had no 
business being where he 
was at the moment. 

He took his wide leather belt in 
another notch and eyed himself 
critically. First, gleaming space 
boots, then flaring breeches of 
midnight black and finally, a 
soft, snug-fitting, high-collared 



tunic with the insignia of the 
Guard which was a crimson 
lightning flash running diago- 
nally across the front. 

On Vega III, the light cruiser 
Andros of the Imperial Legion 
hurtled up through the thin at- 
mosphere . 

The Colonel’s hands caressed 
the smooth butts of the snub-

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



nosed weapons that hung at each 
hip and then slid away to hang 
carelessly at his sides. He turned 
his back to the hatch that led 
into the control room of the 
Glorious , took two casual steps 
and then, without warning, spun 
around as his hands went streak- 
ing for his guns. A split-second 
later, he stood catlike, poised on 
the balls of his feet, both guns 
trained steadily on the glaring 
image of himself that was re- 
flected in the mirror surface of 
the port. 

On Vega III, the light cruiser 
Andros of the Imperial Legion 
hurtled up through the thin at- 
mosphere on a mission of inter- 
stellar conquest . 

“Faster than ever,” said the 
warlike figure with stern satis- 
faction and then, holstering his 
weapons and adjusting his dress 
helmet to a jaunty angle, he 
threw open the hatch that led into 
the control room of the Glorious 
and entered with a measured 
military stride. 

Somebody barked “Attention!” 
and ten sets of heels clicked to- 
gether. Captain Shirey stepped 
forward and saluted. “All present 
and accounted for, sir.” 

T HE owners of the ten sets of 
heels had no more business 
being where they were than did 
their Colonel. The starship Glori- 
ous had GOVERNMENT PROPERTY — 



keep out painted in foot-high 
letters on one side of her main 
entrance port and trespassers 
will be prosecuted on the other 
— warnings that had been blithe- 
ly ignored by the guard when the 
headlights of the battered old 
flyer that had brought them out 
blinked out the three shorts and 
three longs that activated the 
landing lock. 

For a few years after her re- 
turn from Alpha Centauri, a 
small maintenance crew had been 
kept on the Glorious. But, as 
existence became more and more 
peaceful and settled and Man 
slowly adjusted to the idea that 
there was no longer any place to 
go, these were withdrawn until, 
finally, the last watchman was 
removed as being an unnecessary 
charge against the public funds. 

There was talk, for a while, of 
mounting a warper on her and 
turning her into a museum, but 
nobody was really interested ex- 
cept the youngsters — and young- 
sters don’t have votes — so it was 
finally decided to leave her cir- 
cling in her lonely orbit as a per- 
petual monument to the men who 
had taken her out for the first 
and last time. 

“At ease/” As his command re- 
laxed, Colonel Faust stepped out 
of role. 

“Look here, gang,” he said, 
“we’ve worked through those old 
operational manuals of my grand- 



INVASION REPORT

father’s until we know them 
backward. I figure it’s about 
time we put some of what we 
know to work. What would you 
think of the idea of turning on 
the big vision screen?” 

Captain Shirey looked at him 
dubiously. “To run the scanners, 
you’ve got to have power — and 
that means turning on the main 
pile.” 

“So what, Wimpy? All we have 
to do is just like the manuals 
say. We’ve done it a dozen times 
in dry runs.” 

The other still looked doubt- 
ful. “If you make a mistake 
when you’re just pretending, 
nothing blows up. And anyway, 
just being up here would get 
us in enough trouble, if anybody 
caught us. If we start turning 
things on and maybe break some- 
thing, then we’d really catch it. 
Why can’t we just keep on pre- 
tending the same way we have 
been?” 

“Because,” said his commander 
patiently, “you can only learn so 
much by pretending — and we’ve 
learned all we can that way. 
We’ve got to get some practice 
done on the real thing if we’re 
going to be ready when the in- 
vaders come. There won’t be any 
pretending then, not when you 
got to stand back and watch your 
own sister being dragged off to be 
a slave. You just think about 
that for a while.” 



W IMPY dutifully began to 
think about it but, some- 
how, the only reaction he could 
get to the idea of his sister being 
stolen was one of relief rather 
than regret. “They take old 
Emily, they’ll be sorry,” he said 
finally. 

Bill started to nod agreement, 
then caught himself. “Look,” he 
said, “four times now we’ve 
sneaked out my father’s old flyer 
while he was out of town and 
slipped up here — and all we’ve 
done is pretend. We got to start 
really running things if we’re go- 
ing to get trained right. The 
invaders come in and who else 
is going to stop them? Those 
pooping little police boats with a 
ten-mile ceiling and maybe one 
medium paralyzer on them?” 
Wimpy still looked doubtful. 
“You let me do the worrying,” 
said Bill. “I got more right to be 
here than most people.” 

Halfway between Earth and 
Venus there was a sudden shim- 
mer as the Vegan ship slipped 
out of warp into normal space. 
It hung motionless for a minute 
as the alien commander checked 
his instruments and his arma- 
ment. 

Looking at it one way, William 
Faust did have more right than 
most to be on board the Glorious. 
In his room at home, under his 
bed, was his great-grandfather’s 
space-chest. In it lay -the worn

diary that recorded the first high 
hopes when the Glorious took off, 
then the boredom, then the bit- 
terness and disillusionment that 
came when Alpha Centauri was 
found to be a barren and lifeless 
system. 

Bill Faust knew it almost by 
heart, that chronicle of the young 
man who went out on the first — 
and last — starship ever to be 
constructed, of the middle-aged 
man who arrived, of the old man 
who returned to find space-flight 
a thing of the past and the re- 
ports of the expedition that had 
consumed his life used as final 
proof of the DeWitt hypothesis 
that there could be no life on 
other systems. 

There had been a time when 
those whose dreams were strong 
enough to stand the shock of 
crossing over into what adults 
called “the real world” had some 
place to go, once they reached 
the other side. For these, being 
young was a time of waiting and 
training for the day when new 
strength could be tested against 
whatever lay beyond the safe 
frontiers. First, seas and conti- 
nents, then the upper air and 
the pushing of limits toward the 
Moon, the planets, until, these 
once conquered, young eyes 
turned toward the beckoning 
beacons of the distant stars them- 
selves. 

There had been such a time, 



but it existed no longer. With 
the coming of the warpers — those 
strange contraptions that could 
so twist the fabric of space that 
Man and his materials could in- 
stantaneously be moved from any 
place where there was a trans- 
mitter to any other where there 
was a receiver — Mars and Venus 
were nearer than the corner drug- 
store. Once they had been set up, 
space-flight died. There was no 
point in spending months travel- 
ing from one planet to another, 
when one could do it in a frac- 
tion of a second, merely by 
stepping in one door and out 
the other. 

PT^HE one star that could be 
reached had been reached. 
The Glorious had returned to 
slam shut the last gateway to ad- 
venture. As for the other stars, 
they were distant lonely things 
that hung so far out of reach, 
only astronomers any longer 
viewed them with more than 
casual interest. The great mathe- 
maticians and physicists had 
proved so conclusively that a 
faster-than-light drive was im- 
possible, nobody bothered to 
check their figures any longer. 

Life was snug and easy and 
pleasant — and, above all, sen- 
sible. Only the youngsters still 
dreamed of danger and the search 
for strange things in far places. 
And, since the best of the psy-

chologists said that a temporary 
sojourn into a world of make- 
believe was important to the 
growing process, the young ones 
were permitted to assume such 
strange warlike disguises as were 
necessary to take them into imag- 
inary worlds of high adventure — 
providing, of course, that they 
weren’t too noisy about it and 
emerged in time for supper with 
clean hands and clean faces . 

“Check pile controls!” As 
usual. Colonel Faust had won 
his point. 

“All on full safety, sir,” said 
Second Lieutenant Randolph with 
a most unmilitary quaver in his 
voice. He was the most junior 
of the junior officers, a preco- 
cious nine-year-old who was 
four or five years younger than 
the rest of the Guardsmen and 
he had an unfortunate habit of 
bursting into tears during mo- 
ments of stress. He was already 
sniffling slightly, when Bill came 
over to check the control posi- 
tions against the diagram he’d 
memorized. 

With a curt nod of approval, 
Cqlonel Faust went over to his 
position at the coordination 
board and grasped the red handle 
of the master pile control. 

"Power on!” 

He pulled back slowly until 
the lever clicked into the normal 
operation slot. In the pile room 
of the Glorious, control rods slid 



smoothly back until they were 
checked by the safety catches. 
There was a faint hum of trans- 
formers as the long-neglected 
ship warmed to life. 

“Battle screen on!” 

A Guardsman frowned in con- 
centration and slowly began to 
throw the switches that linked 
the great screen with the scan- 
ners set in the outer hull. There 
was a flicker and then a few tiny 
white spots blinked on to show 
meteors large enough to be de- 
tected. But, aside from these, 
there was nothing to show that 
the screen had been powered. 

Colonel Faust gave a grunt of 
satisfaction, rose to his feet and 
faced his Guardsmen. 

“Your attention, gentlemen,” 
he said in a tone of command. 

T EN grim-faced Guardsmen 
leaned forward expectantly as 
he pointed dramatically to the 
empty screen. 

“As you can see, the Plutonian 
fleet is approaching in a cone for- 
mation with their heaviest ships 
at the tip. These are carrying a 
deadly new weapon, the Q-ray. 
Our mission is to break through 
the cone and destroy the flagship, 
from which the Warlord of Pluto 
is personally directing the opera- 
tions of his fleet. Earth expects 
every man to do his duty.” He 
paused and then barked, “En- 
gage!” 



INVASION REPORT

PT'HE Guardsmen hunched at 
their positions as their imag- 
inations suddenly populated the 
empty screen with a hurtling cone 
of enemy ships. 

Many were the fierce encoun- 
ters in the next few hours, and 
close were the brushes with death. 
When the Glorious tore through 
the outer cone of Plutonian ships 
and came within range of the 
shimmering web of Q-rays, the 
Guardsmen reacted to the fiery 
touch in quite different fashions. 
Their Colonel had invented the 
new weapon on the spur of the 
moment and there had been no 
chance for agreement as to just 
what its effects would be. 

Bill remained seated at the co- 
ordination board, his face set in 
a mask of heroic and Promethian 
suffering. Wimpy, on the other 
hand, went threshing around on 
the control room floor, howling 
that his skin was coming off and 
that his bones were turning to 
limp and rubbery things. The rest 
of the Guards were so impressed 
by his performance that it wasn't 
long before the whole contingent, 
Bill included, were writhing on 
the floor like wounded snakes. 

“The Warlord is making a run 
for it!” Colonel Faust’s voice rang 
through the general hubbub. 
“We’ve got to intercept him. Sta- 
tions!” 

Deaf to all but the call of duty, 
the dying Guardsmen summoned 



up strength from some hidden re- 
serve and crawled painfully back 
to their posts on the supposedly 
rotting stumps of what once had 
been arms and legs. Colonel 
Faust fought for five minutes be- 
fore he was able to reach the mas- 
ter controls. A wavering cheer 
went up as they once more began 
to creep up on the ship of the 
tyrant. He fought back desper- 
ately, his great guns hammering 
shot after shot into the Glorious, 
but still the gallant ship drove 
on, her mighty drive tubes in- 
candescent under the overload. 

“Prepare to ram!” 

As the Glorious went into her 
final dive, the game was suddenly 
terminated by a harsh clangor 
from the proximity alarm and a 
red dot jumped into being in the 
upper left corner of the vision 
screen. As it crawled toward the 
center, alarm after alarm went 
off until the control room was fill- 
ed with a clanging din. 

“Shut those things off!” yelled 
Bill. Jimmie Ozaki, the Guards- 
man at the detection station, 
kicked over a series of switches 
and the noise suddenly stopped. 

“What is it?” 

Jimmie stared at the instru- 
ments in front of him, as if he’d 
never seen them before. “If I’m 
reading these things right, what- 
ever it is would be about fifteen 
thousand miles out and coming in 
fast, I’d say. It just popped up 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



out of no place. So I guess I’m 
not reading these things right.” 

Bill went over and made a 
quick check. “You are.” 

“Couldn’t be a meteor, could 
it?” asked Wimpy. 

Bill shook his head. “If it was. 
it would show up as a white dot. 
Red indicates radiation of some 
sort. The only thing I can figure 
out is that somebody is out there 
in a flyer.” 

“Ain’t no flyer can travel that 
fast,” objected Ozaki. “And how 
come it popped up like it did? 
Even if it were coasting along 
with its drive off, its mass would 
still have registered on the de- 
tectors.” 

Bill stared up at the screen un- 
easily. “Could be that the scan- 
ners are out of kilter somehow. 
You keep checking, Jimmie.” 

FT^IVE minutes later, it was 
reported as being only a hun- 
dred miles away and slowing rap- 
idly. And then Jimmie Ozaki let 
out a sudden yell. “It’s hitting us 
with some sort of a high fre- 
quency beam. Looks as if it 
might be in the communication 
band.” 

“Try and tune it in, but don’t 
answer.” 

The Guardsman at the com- 
munication station leaned over 
his controls. A moment later a 
speaker came to life. A hissing 
stream of sibilants came from it, 



sounds like nothing that had ever 
been produced by human vocal 
apparatus. The message was re- 
peated twice and then the speaker 
went silent. So did the Guards- 
men. 

Bill was the first to speak. 
There was a nervous smile on 
his face when he did. “It must be 
a police boat,” he said in a strain- 
ed voice. “They must of spotted 
us sneaking up here and they’re 
trying to throw a scare into us. 
We’re in for it, now.” 

“That’s no police boat, and you 
know it,” whispered Wimpy. 
“The flyers they got couldn’t go 
out that far, even if they wanted 
to.” 

“It’s moving in again.” 

Bill swung quickly to the de- 
tection station. “Can you pick 
that up on visual?” 

“I’ll try.” 

The detection screen blanked 
out for a minute, then lit up again 
to show a silver speck hanging in 
darkness. 

“Crank her up!” 

As power was thrown into the 
magnifiers, the strange ship swell- 
ed in size until it filled half the 
screen, a gleaming sphere that 
was like nothing that was recog- 
nizable. 

“Still think that’s a police 
boat?” said Wimpy in a strained 
voice. 

Bill didn’t answer. He watched 
in horrified fascination as the 



INVASION REPORT 



85 



strange ship hurtled toward the 
Glorious. It looked as if it were 
on a collision course, but it sud- 
denly began to decelerate and 
then, finally, curved into a path 
that put it in orbit around the 
Glorious. 

“How close now?” 

Ozaki, at the detection station, 
had trouble getting his eyes off 
the screen long enough to read 
his instruments. 

“Less than a mile,” he said 
finally. 

“What now?” squeaked some- 
body. 

Nobody had an immediate an- 
swer. The Guardsmen looked at 
each other and then at the sud- 
denly strange control room, where 
everything now seemed to be con- 
structed on a scale several sizes 
too large for them. It was a place 
for men, not for boys. They all 
turned to Bill and waited for him 
to say something. 

For a moment, he couldn’t. He 
was being pulled in two direc- 
tions at once. Panic tugged at 
him, panic that threatened mo- 
mentarily to seize control of his 
legs and send him bolting to the 
safety of the old flyer that sat in 
the landing lock. Against this urge 
to flee was the dawning realiza- 
tion that they were no longer 
playing a game which could be 
discontinued at will. It was like a 
nightmare where one has sud- 
denly lost the saving knowledge 



that he can always wake up if 
things get too bad. 

T O run or to stand, to retreat 
from grim reality or to face it 
— the decision had to be made. 
Bill was standing on the line that 
separates the child from the man 
and he had to move one way or 
the other. He looked at the men ; 
acing shape on the screen, then 
at the frightened faces of the 
other boys who were waiting for 
him to take the lead. 

He dropped his eyes and it 
seemed as if the deck plates be- 
neath his feet had turned to glass, 
so that he could see the smug, de- 
fenseless world that stretched out 
below. A tidy, rational world that 
had long ago given up such child- 
ish things as arms and armies — 
and spaceships. When he finally 
spoke, his voice was so low they 
could hardly hear him. 

“We’ve got to stay,” he said. 
When the words penetrated, 
there was a shuffling of feet and 
a muttering of disagreement. 
“We shouldn’t have come out 
here in the first place!” said 
Wimpy. 

Second Lieutenant Randolph 
began to sniffle. “I want to go 
home,” he announced. “Right 
now!”* 

“Me too,” said Ozaki, “and 
I’m going. Let’s get out of here 
before it’s too late.” He started 
to sidle toward the door. The 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rest wavered, then began to fol- 
low him. 

Bjll hesitated only a moment, 
then dashed across the control 
room and slammed the door shut. 
“Wait!” he shouted, throwing 
himself in front of it. “It’s al- 
ready too late. You can’t get 
away now.” 

Captain Shirey forgot about 
military courtesy and cocked one 
hard fist under his superior’s nose. 
“You get out of the way or you’re 
going to get a bust on the snoot!” 
“You’ve got to listen to me,” 
said Bill frantically. “That 
thing’s only a mile away from us 
and we’re three hundred miles 
out from Earth. You saw how 
fast it can go. If it’s looking for 
trouble, do you think it’s just go- 
ing to sit by and let us pull away 
in that old flyer?” 

Wimpy started to answer and 
then stopped. He let his fist drop 
slowly to his side. “Maybe you’re 
right,” he said slowly. “But if we 
don’t run, then what?” 

“Just sit for a while and see 
what happens. From the way that 
ship’s acting, they must figure the 
Glorious has been abandoned. 
They’d never have come this 
close, if they didn’t. If they’re 
just snooping around and don’t 
catch on that anybody’s in here, 
maybe they’ll just go away.” 
There were wistful glances 
toward the door, but after a 
moment, the whole contingent 



straggled back to their positions. 

As they watched the alien ship, 
a square hatch opened in its 
gleaming spherical hull. There 
was a suggestion of movement 
and then a long, torpedo-shaped 
object slowly emerged and float- 
ed free alongside the ship. There 
was something seated on it — 
something that wasn’t human! It 
wore a wheel-shaped spacesuit 
with a hemispherical vision dome 
bulging out from the center. 

T HERE was a little spurt of 
flame from the rear of the 
torpedo and then it sped away 
from the alien ship, twisting and 
looping about. The thing riding 
on it moved busily for a mo- 
ment, adjusting the controls. 
Then he brought it to a halt with 
its nose pointing toward the 
Glorious. 

“What do you think they’re 
figuring on doing with that?” 
asked Wimpy in a shaky voice. 
“Using it on us.” 

“What for?” 

“How many other spaceships 
does Earth have? Once the Glori- 
ous is knocked out, there’s noth- 
ing left that can be used against 
them.” 

“But this thing can’t fight,” 
protested Wimpy. “And there’s 
nobody left that knows how to 
run her.” 

“She could fight once,” said 
Bill grimly. “Maybe she still can. 



INVASION REPORT 



87 



And there is somebody left to run 
her — us/” He turned his back to 
the screen and snapped, “Sta- 
tions!” The Guard slowly took on 
a semblance of order. 

“All positions on. And I mean 
really on! We aren’t playing any 
longer. I want an immediate re- 
port on the condition of this tub.” 
There was hesitation for a mo- 
ment, then a sudden flurry of ac- 
tion at each position as switches 
were thrown and instruments 
read. When they came, the re- 
ports weren’t very encouraging. 
“All drives disconnected.” 

The Glorious couldn’t run 
away. 

“No missiles in the racks.” 
“No shells in the lockers.” 

The Glorious couldn’t fight. 
“There’s got to be something,” 
said Bill as he went over to the 
gunnery station. The Guardsman 
at the controls looked up unhap- 
pily and pointed to the long row 
of little red plates that registered 
the number of rounds available 
for each gun. Each was blinking 
out the word EMPTY. “Turrets 
and automatic trackers are still 
operational, but that doesn’t help 
any.” 

Bill stood thinking a minute. 
“Maybe it can,” he said finally 
and went back to the coordina- 
tion board. “Look, gang,” he said. 
“What we know and what they 
know are two different things. 
They’ve no way of knowing that 



those guns aren’t loaded. Maybe 
we can pull a bluff.” 

“And if we can’t?” said some- 
body. 

He shrugged. “Somebody got a 
better idea? We can’t just sit here 
and let them blow up the ship.” 

W IMPY let out a sudden 
shout and pointed toward 
the screen. Bill spun around and 
saw the alien was leaving the tor- 
pedo and returning to his ship. He 
felt a sudden dryness in his throat. 

“This is it!” he. yelled. “All 
guns on target!” 

There was a growl of powerful 
motors as the turrets, set in blis- 
ters along the top and sides of the 
Glorious, swung swiftly to zero- 
in their long-muzzled guns on the 
alien ship. There was no reaction 
for a moment, and then a long 
burst of sound came from the 
wall speakers. 

“Do you want to answer that?” 
• Bill shook his head. “Better 
if we don’t talk. Maybe they’ve 
got some sort of a translator over 
there. If I start shooting off my 
mouth, I might say the wrong 
thing.” 

“Bill!” There was a shout from 
the detection station. 

“Yeah?” He didn’t look away 
from the screen. The torpedo still 
hung motionless, its nose pointed 
toward the Glorious. 

“I think they’re trying to make 
visual contact.” 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“See if you can pick them up.” 
Bill ordered. 

There was a flickering in the 
reproduction cube of the tri-V 
receiver and, slowly, a distorted 
replica of the control room of the 
alien ship began to materialize. 
Then, as the Guardsman at the 
communication station struggled 
with his controls, the scene clear- 
ed. 

There were seven of them. 
They weren’t humanoid — they 
looked like huge furry footballs 
— but they weren’t the slavering 
monstrosities that Bill and the 
rest had half expected. 

“Turn on our transmitter.” 
After a brief warm-up period, 
there was a bouncing of aliens 
and their own screen lit up. Bill 
stepped forward and, as sternly 
as he could, made a stabbing mo- 
tion toward Earth with a bent 
forefinger. There was a small 
commotion while all the fur balls 
rolled together to form a huddle. 
Then one of them went bouncing 
over to a set of controls at the far 
end of their control room. 

“The bluff didn’t work,” gasp- 
ed Wimpy. “They’re going to 
blast us with that torp!” 

“Not yet,” said Bill. “Gun- 
nery!” 

“Yes?” 

“Automatic trackers on!” 

The Guardsman at the gun- 
nery station looked puzzled, but 
he didn’t ask any questions. His 



hands slid forward and the para- 
bolic mirrors that projected the 
UHF beams — that had once con- 
trolled the guided missiles carried 
by the Glorious — swung until 
they were centered on the silver 
sphere. 

“Carriers on!” 

“Check.” 

T HERE was a sudden flurry 
of movement in the alien con- 
trol rooms as their detectors gave 
warning of the beams that were 
striking their hull. Bill faced the 
tri-V scanner and held up his 
hand for attention. There was 
some more scuttling and then all 
the aliens faced toward their own 
screen. Bill withdrew one of the 
odd-shaped weapons that hung 
at his hip and held it up so they 
could see it. 

“Get over here, Wimpy.” 
“What for?” 

“Hurry up. And play it 
straight.” 

The freckle-faced second in 
command marched over with a 
military stride and saluted. 
“Q-ray,” said Bill. “Get it?” 
Wimpy started to protest and 
then caught himself. “Sounds 
crazy to me,” he muttered, “but 
you’re the boss.” 

Bill’s side-arm was - a compli- 
cated affair with two short bar- 
rels, one capped with a green lens 
and the other with a red. He held 
the weapon out to call attention 



I N VASION REPORT

to it and then raised it and press- 
ed a stud on the stock three times. 
Three bursts of red light flared 
out briefly. 

“Give them three quick flips on 
the missile beams.” 

The Guardsman hit the cut-off 
button one, two, three. 

Bill’s gun flashed red three 
more times. 

“Once more should give them 
the idea.” 

Again the carrier beams were 
clicked on and off. 

“Make this good.” Bill pointed 
the weapon deliberately at 
Wimpy and pressed the stud. 
Captain Shirey stood at attention, 
a circle of red light glowing on his 
chest. 

“Now!” There was a sudden 
green flash as Bill jerked the 
other trigger. 

Immediately Wimpy let out a 
bloodcurdling yell and then, 
clawing at his chest, collapsed in 
a writhing heap on the floor. Bill 
turned back to the scanner and 
pointed to his gun again. 

“Three more.” By the time the 
barrier beams had struck the 
other ship twice, chaos had let 
loose in its control room. 

“What’s happening?” 

It was hard to tell. They were 
lined up in a row, their pink 
underbodies tilted toward the 
ceiling, and weak little leglike or- 
gans waving wildly. 

“I think,” said Colonel Faust 



slowly, “that they’re standing on 
their heads.” 

But surrender was not negoti- 
ated without some difficulty. The 
alien who seemed to be the com- 
mander kept bouncing in and out 
of one of a pair of metallic cups 
that projected from a complex 
mechanism at one side of the con- 
trol room. Bill finally got the idea. 

“I think they’ve got some sort 
of a mechanical translator and 
they want me to come over.” 

There was a protest from the 
floor. “You can’t go there!” 

“Shut up!” said Bill. “You’re 
supposed to be dead. Do you 
want to give the whole show 
away?” Wimpy subsided obe- 
diently. “I’ve got to go over. We 
can’t escort them down and, once 
they find out that we aren’t fol- 
lowing, there’s nothing to keep 
them from making a run for it. 
I’ll take the flyer over. There’s 
a three-quarter-size pressure suit 
in the luggage compartment that 
I think I can get into. Keep me 
covered.” 

“With what?” softly mumbled 
Wimpy. 

L ATER, with one exception, the 
Solar Guard stood at atten- 
tion as a small red dot crawled 
toward one comer of the detec- 
tion screen. 

“Can I get up now?” said a 
plaintive voice. 

Colonel Bill Faust looked down 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



at the sprawled form of his sec- 
ond in command and then sud- 
denly doubled up and began to 
emit strangled sounds that were 
half sobs and half laughter. He 
finally recovered enough to reach 
down and pull Wimpy to his feet. 

“You were real good, Wimpy. 
Real good!” He went off into an- 
other hysterical paroxysm. 

Wimpy grabbed him by the 
shoulders and shook him. “ Stop 
it! Why did you let them go?” 

“They — they . .” Bill choked, 
gasped and then tried again. 
“They couldn’t stay any longer. 
They had to get home for sup- 
per.” 

“They what?” gasped Wimpy. 

“They had to get home for sup- 
per.” Bill pointed at the screen. 
“And there they go.” 

TOASTER, the red dot went, and 
faster still and then it flicked 
out of sight. 

“I’ll bet that’s the last time 
they come snooping around the 
Reservation,” said Bill with a 
mysterious grin. 

“The what?” 

“The Reservation. That’s this 
whole star cluster.” 

Wimpy advanced purposefully 
and waved a fist threateningly. 
“Are you going to tell us what 
happened or do we have to beat 
it out of you?” 

Bill worked hard to control 
himself. “Suppose,” he said at

last, “that, aside from a few dead 
systems like Alpha Centauri, the 
Universe was full of life — and 
some of the races have had in- 
terstellar drives for so long that 
even the kids’ flyers are equipped 
with them.” He looked around at 
the boys. 

“Go ahead,” said Wimpy im- 
patiently. 

“Don’t you get it?” 

They all stared at him blankly. 

“Well,” he continued, “suppose 
a bunch of kids were out one day 
and they went poking around 
where they had no business being 
and they found a big old ship 
that looked deserted.” 

“The Glorious!" 

“So, whenever they could get 
away, they’d sneak over and play 
invasion.” 

“Oh, no!” said Wimpy. 

“And then, one day, they 
decided to run a real all-out 
offensive, and one of the kids bor- 
rowed his father’s ship without 
bothering to ask permission. And 
right in the middle of the game, 
the turrets on the ship they 
thought was deserted suddenly 
swing around and they find a 
couple of dozen space-rifles 



pointed directly at them. They 
want to run away, but they’re 
too scared, and to make matters 
worse, they get a demonstration 
of a horrible strange weapon. And 
we thought we were scared!” 
There was silence in the con- 
trol room for a moment as the 
Guardsmen tried to digest what 
had happened. 

“But what about the torpedo?” 
asked Wimpy. 

Bill patted the elaborate toy 
that hung at his right hip. “It 
had as much real punch as this. 
They were making believe that 
it was a vortex torpedo — they’d 
rigged it up with remote controls 
— but it was really only one of 
the little flyers that they turn out 
for the kids over there. It’s an 
old one, but its interstellar drive 
is still working.” 

He paused, then said in an off- 
hand manner, “I brought it back 
with me. It’s got an adjustable 
warp field that’ll open up wide 
enough to handle a ship the size 
of the Glorious, and I — well, it 
seemed to me that, maybe, it 
might get space travel going . .” 
It did.

5 Star Shelf 



DARK DOMINION by David 
Duncan. Ballantine Books, Inc., 
Cloth $2.50, paper 35c 

HPHIS may prove to be the best 
-*■ original science fiction novel 
of 1954 — despite the fact that it 
was serialized in Collier's, a mag- 
azine not generally noted for ma- 
ture fiction. Unlike most slick 
science fiction, this tale makes 
no compromise with the so-called 
"lay” audience. It’s not written 
down, or oversimplified, or cheap- 
ened in any way. You will find it 
enthralling and somber with a 
very sharp and pertinent point. 



The plot deals with an at- 
tempt on the part of the United 
States to put up a space station 
with which we can control the 
world — our friends as well as our 
enemies. The effort makes us 
rather unpopular. 

Mixed in with this grim main 
plot is a subplot dealing with the 
discovery and use of a complete- 
ly new form of matter known as 
Magellanium — and is one of the 
most exciting concepts in mod- 
ern science fiction. 

It’s an impressive book, done 
with the skill of a practiced nov- 
elist and the respect for human

values of a richly endowed mind. 
Don’t miss it! 

OPERATIONAL PHILOSO- 
PHY by Anatol Rapoport. Har- 
per & Bros., $3.75 

F OR all those readers who have 
been fascinated, yet at the 
same time confused, by such new 
concepts of thought as “non-Aris- 
totelian logic,” “symbolic logic,” 
Boolean algebra and so on, this 
book will come as a godsend. 

Most previous volumes on 
these subjects have, for the lay- 
man, been much too technical 
and often stuffily pedantic; Kor- 
zybski’s works, for example. 

In the present book, on the 
other hand, we have a lucid, 
beautifully simple analysis of 
many of the modern discoveries in 
thinking that have grown out of 
the original breaking away from 
Aristotle’s narrow concept of 
logic. In addition, the author pre- 
sents a splendidly unified philos- 
ophy based on these new ideas. 

You will be amazed at how 
fruitful, in almost all fields of 
thought and action, this new ap- 
proach can be. For instance, it is 
remarkable how much light it 
throws on the validity of many 
of the more mature science fic- 
tion stories of our time. 

It is not a book for people who 
operate wholly on the basis of 
preconceived notions. For those 



who are willing to re-examine the 
very foundations of their domi- 
nant ideas, however, a creative — 
and disturbing — experience. 

REVOLT IN 2100 by Robert A. 
Heinlein. Shasta Publishers, $3.50 

N O question about it, the Old 
Master is still “the best story 
teller in the science fiction field 
today,” as Henry Kuttner states 
in his introduction to this, the 
third in the “Future History” 
series of Heinlein’s novelets and 
short stories. 

“If This Goes On — ” which 
takes up nearly two-thirds of the 
book — is a smashing tale of revo- 
lution in the United States — a 
revolution against a theocratic 
dictatorship that takes place 
around the year 2100. It’s been 
slightly fixed up, to modernize it 
(it first appeared in 1940), but 
essentially it’s the same rowdy 
and terrifying tale it was in the 
first place. 

“Coventry” takes up another 
67 pages. In this tale, our civili- 
zation has reached maturity fol- 
lowing the overthrow of the 
dictatorship, and the Coventry of 
the title is a huge enclosed area 
where the immature may go if 
they wish to experience “adven- 
ture,” “excitement” and the 
“freedom” of the long-vanished 
frontier days. And they certainly 
get them all, with a vengeance,

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in the Wild (human) Animal Re- 
serve that Coventry really is. 

“Misfit,” which ends the book, 
is a fine short story about a boy 
whose great talents were not rec- 
ognized until almost too late. 
Libby is a lesson to our whole 
educational system. 

The book is a classic. 

SPIDER’S WAR by S. Fowler 
Wright. Abelard Press, $2.75 

T HOUGH good reading from 
beginning to end, this melo- 
drama of a distant future is not 
one of Wright’s major efforts; it 
cannot rank with Deluge, for in- 
stance. On the other hand, the 
book is the strongest statement 
of Wright’s corrosively pessimis- 
tic philosophy he has ever done. 

In his world of a distant future, 
there is limited cannibalism (why 
waste good flesh in time of fa- 
mine?) in a semi-cooperative, 
partly telepathic, primitive and 
yet sophisticated tribal society. 

The conflicts are between two 
tribes of different culture levels, 
one on one bank of a wide river 
and the other on the opposite 
side; and, later, between both 
tribes against a small race of 
elephant-size spiders inhabiting 
a large peninsula where two riv- 
ers meet. 

Mr. Wright characteristically 
seems to respect the spiders more 
than he does the humans. 



BORN OF MAN AND WO- 
MAN by Richard Matheson. The 
Chamberlain Press, Inc., $3.00 

F OR a young man whose first 
story was published in 1950, 
this collection represents a pretty 
solid achievement. It contains 17 
of the best pieces, most of them 
in the horror field and a majority 
of them weird fantasy rather than 
science fiction. They all bear the 
imprint of a distinctive and orig- 
inal talent, even though the in- 
fluences of John Collier, Ray 
Bradbury, Philip MacDonald 
and others do show through. 

One of the two unpublished 
stories in the book, “The Trav-

It’s a story you will not easily

living, on a planet with almost 
unbearably heavy gravity. It is 
a highly technical piece of science 
fiction, not designed for the slick 
market, but it’s definitely worth 
the effort. 

The relations of the single hu- 
man being stranded on the planet 
with the little caterpillarlike in- 
telligences that are one of its 
dominant life-forms are warmly 
and realistically developed. And 
the innate plea for cooperation 
between all life that lies at the 
base of the book gives it a spe- 
cial kind of durability. 

Clement’s schoolmasterish 
tone, which critics have previous- 
ly complained about, is present 
here, too. But I, at least, don’t 
mind it. 

WORLDS IN SPACE by Martin 
Caidin. Henry Holt & Co., $4.95 

A LMOST monthly now, we 
have new books on Man’s 
future in space. Little that is new 
remains to be said and Mr. Cai- 
din does not say much of it. 
However, his book is a clear, non- 
technical retelling of the ever- 
fascinating story of the coming 
age of space flight and our ac- 
complishments (and defeats) 
made thus far toward bringing 
that age into being. 

The black-and-white drawings 
by Fred L. Wolff are a bit too 
air-brushy for my taste, lacking 



the sharp clarity and realism of 
similar pictures by Bonestell, 
Hunter, Klep, et al., but they are 
imaginative and often handsome. 

GATEWAY TO TOMORROW, 
edited by John Carnell. Science 
Fiction Club, London. Available 
in this country from science fic- 
tion bookstores for about $2.75 

J OHN CARNELL’S second 
all-British science fiction an- 
thology is as satisfactory as his 
first. Ten stories, of which seven 
are Class B or better — mostly As 
— is a high average. Included are 
four Galaxy tales — by Peter 
Phillips, John Wyndham, J. T. 
McIntosh and John Christopher. 

Arthur Clarke has another A 
.'rom Astounding; this is the only 
one that has thus far appeared in 
another anthology in the U. S. 

Of the five from the British 
New Worlds, the one by E. C. 
Tubbs is quite good, the other 
four not really top grade. 

Nevertheless, the book as a 
whole is a fine indication of the 
lusty health of science fiction 
writing in England.

magazine and seven from other 
publications. It is an extremely 
uneven collection, ranging from 
good (“The Monsters,” “Cost of 
Living,” and “Specialist,” for ex- 
ample), down to rather deriva- 
tive and fluffy stuff. 

The book is a bouillabaisse of 
science fiction, fantasy, and 
weird stories; and you get some- 
thing of a feeling that the young 
author (his first story appeared 
late in 1951, I believe) is still 
trying to discover his own par- 
ticular bent — experimenting, in 
other words, with a wide variety 
of story types — and that he 
hasn’t quite found his footing. 

Still, it is a highly entertaining 
book. 

HERO'S WALK by Robert 
Crane. Ballantine Books, $2.50 & 
35c 

A ND still they come — second 
from Ballantine this month! 
— the books on the dangers of 
putting space stations and space 
rockets out into the great un- 
known. The present offering is a 
melodramatic one, dealing with 
dangers internal (a ruthless world 
dictator) and external (a galac- 
tic civilization afraid of us). 

The dictator wants to explore 
beyond Mars, for his own per- 
sonal aggrandizement, but the 
“Ampiti,” a mysterious galactic 
race, warns us by strange radio 



messages (and later by actual 
physical attack) that we will be 
destroyed if we try it. 

By overthrowing the dictator 
and coming to terms with the 
Ampiti, we finally arrive at a 
modus vivendi — or seem to. 

It’s a strong book, full of warn- 
ings to a primitive, war-minded, 
bureaucratically strangled world 
such as ours. 

STARSHIP THROUGH 
SPACE by Lee Correy. Henry 
Holt 8e Co., $2.50 

fTiHIS somewhat condescending 
juvenile (he refers to his 
young heroes as “lads” and 
“boys”) must be compared with 
Robert Heinlein’s Starman Jones, 
(Galaxy, May, 1954), since they 
both deal with the first flights 
of faster-than-light ships. The 
comparison is a bit cruel. 

Even though Correy’s book is 
readable, has a lot of technical- 
sounding scientific discussion, and 
is erected on a simple and direct 
plot skeleton, it simply cannot 
stand up to its predecessor in 
characterizations, in style, in in- 
genuity, or in overall dramatic 
impact. 

Nevertheless, the book does 
move, and if the juniors in your 
family have nothing better to 
do with their time, they won’t, 
at least* be bored with it.

the departed 

Let the dead past bury its dead? 



No . leave the dirty work to the unborn future! 



By ARTHUR SELLINGS 



“As a sleep / must think on 
my days. 

Of my path as untrod, Or 
trodden in dreams — ” 

Y ES, he was able to carry 
on the verse he had start- 
ed as the switch had clos- 
ed. He was still here — wherever 
here was — 

“ — in a dreamland whose coasts 
are a doubt'." 

Whose countries recede from 
my thoughts as they grope round 
about. 



What, he wondered, were the 
others thinking of at this mo- 
ment? He thought to call out, 
to see if they answered, to see if 
they were still there — wherever 
there was. 

But none of the others had 
called out. Or, if they had, he 
wasn’t able to hear them, in which 
case it wasn’t much use for him 
to shout. Or they hadn’t, and he 
wasn’t going to be the first. His 
voice might ring despairingly, 
ragged with panic, in the dark- 
ness. After all, he was their 
leader. 



Illustrated by FLEMINGER

Leader! He chuckled inwardly. 
It was absurd, really. The whole 
thing was absurd — the solemn 
handshakes from the young man 
in the sober gray serge, the terse 
wishing of good luck as the mo- 
ment of departure drew near. 
Departure? That was too easy a 
word. The right one was eviction. 

And how did it go on? 

“ — And vanish and tell us not 
how." 

Now that was appropriate. 
Strange that he should be recit- 
ing to himself a verse he had long 
ago forgotten. More — that he 
couldn’t even remember ever hav- 
ing learned. Yet it was fitting; 
a piece, he thought, with the ends 
of so many other poets. How 
more appropriately could Rilke 
have died than in agony from the 
infected scratch of a rose? Or 
poor, mad de Nerval than by 
hanging himself upside down, like 
the Hanged Man of the Tarot 
pack, in a Paris sewer? 

This was far less dramatic, 
more in keeping with the age 
that had turned him and the 
others out, but it was, he told 
himself, right in the tradition. 
Most poets were a pretty poor 
lot at managing their lives, but 
they usually seemed to get in a 
good piece of arranging at the 
finish. 

Finish? But this wasn’t. It 



was dark and silent and there was 
no feeling of ground beneath his 
feet. But this wasn’t the finish — 
not yet, anyway. 

O UT of confusion of decades, 
the continuing lines broke 
through : 

“Be kind to our darkness, 

O Fashioner, dwelling in light, 
And feeding the lamps of the 
sky — ” 

His memory petered out at 
the same instant that he realized 
the darkness had lifted slightly 
and he was standing on solid 
ground again. It was still dark, 
but it was the darkness of night, 
not the absolute darkness of — 
wherever it was they had been. 

He was conscious of several 
dark shapes standing by him. 
For a moment, they were hushed. 
He counted them. There were 
five. So they had all arrived. And 
he realized that this was why 
they had been silent. They had 
been counting, too. 

Now they spoke and somebody 
fumbled for a torch. The light 
went gaping around the knot of 
old men, showing the fallen 
cheeks, the bald and the white 
heads, the bleary, surprised eyes. 
“Well, we got here.” 

“But it’s dark.” 

“All I could think of while I 
was out there was that I’d left 



THE DEPARTED

my false teeth behind.” 

‘‘Hah, that’s a good one.” 
“Jeez, but it’s cold!” 

The last statement brought 
realization to them all. They were 
chilled not only by fear and un- 
certainty. 

“Where’s the guy with the 
stove?” 

Hawkins, the poet and the 
leader, looked down. Yes, the 
pack was at his feet, just as it 
had been when the switch had 
closed. He bent down and un- 
zipped it. He lit the stove with 
hands that trembled from cold 
and tension. The men huddled 
around it, crouching, rubbing 
their hands, white plumes of their 
breath disappearing upward over 
the heat it gave forth. 

“Mm-mm. Good piece of 
equipment.” That was Bell, the 
old colonel. His voice still had 
the clipped quality of the pro- 
fessional officer. “Almost as good 
as the Mark Nine.” 

“I don’t think I’ve ever been 
as cold as this,” said Green, the 
carpenter. 

“Perhaps there’s been another 
Ice Age,” Hawkins suggested. 

“Not in seven hundred and 
fifty years.” Who was that? Oh, 
Lindsay, the professorial-looking 
little man. Hawkins realized that 
he didn’t know anything about 
him. There was no reason, of 
course, why he should. But he did 
know something about the others. 



They had chatted during the few 
minutes before they had been 
gathered into the chamber. Bell, 
Green, Hasse, an electrician. And 
Ez, whose surname hadn’t been 
known even to the clerk. He’d 
survived one appeal, he had told 
Hawkins, and then, because there 
were no records, they had assess- 
ed him at retiring age, seventy. 
In fact, as he had confided with 
a wink while the attendant reach- 
ed for the switch, he was nearly 
eighty-three. 

“How can you say it’s seven 
hundred and fifty years?” That 
was Bell again, his voice peremp- 
tory and querulous. Hawkins 
smiled to himself. Must have 
been a blow to the poor chap, 
a leader of men, not to be 
leader now on this pathetic and 
unretraceable excursion. Instead, 
he was under the command of a 
damned longhair. That’s prob- 
ably what he calls me, Hawkins 
thought, a damned longhair. 

I N the light of the stove, Lind- 
say’s lips made a downward 
self-deprecatory gesture before 
he replied. “I heard — on fairly 
reliable authority — that it was 
seven hundred and fifty years.” 
“Nobody’s supposed to know,” 
said Bell, “nobody at all” — in a 
tone which implied the added 
words, “not even me.” 

“It’s somewhere between two 
hundred and a thousand years, 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



but the exact time’s supposed 
to be strictly secret.” 

Strictly Secret, thought Haw- 
kins, Top Secret, To Be Read 
and Destroyed Immediately. 
That must have been the circle, 
the delight of Bell’s rigidly mili- 
tary life. It was all over, but he 
still clung to it. 

“Does it really matter?” Haw- 
kins asked mildly. "Now?” 

Bell’s eyes glared in the light. 
“Of course it matters. There have 
to be rules. Even in this business, 
everything should be above- 
board.” 

“Who cares about rules?” 
Hasse broke in. “I’m amazed that 
we’ve arrived, whatever century 
it is. I thought it was all a hoax, 
a handy kind of gas- chamber for 
getting rid of us dodderers.” 

Bell snorted. 

“It’s funny,” Hasse went on, 
as if talking to himself. “All my 
life, I thought that everything 
any of the high-ups told us was 
a lie. Whenever a politician open- 
ed his mouth, or a scientist, or 
a general, I always took what 
he said with a grain of salt. A 
whole sack of salt. And now ...” 
He shrugged, not entirely with- 
out humor. “I had to wait till now 
to find out that it wasn’t all 
hokum. Not this time, anyway. 
Unless — unless this is — ” He 
stopped short at the thought. 
"Death?” whispered Green. 

Ez tittered. “That ain't so. 



Don’t know about you folks, but 
it wouldn’t be as cold as this 
where I’d be goin’.” 

But nobody else laughed. 

“It’s all wrong,” Green in- 
sisted. “It’s heathen and un- 
natural.” He was a quiet man 
who didn’t look old the way the 
others did. He looked middle- 
aged, but as if he’d looked 
middle-aged all his adult life. 
“God didn’t mean anything like 
this. He meant that men should 
live their lives out in a natural 
way, in the time and place He 
appointed for them. This way is 
plain un-Christian.” 

“From any viewpoint,” said 
Bell firmly, “it’s unethical. I 
never did agree with it. In the 
past few years, I’ve done a lot 
of lobbying against it. It’s just 
not ethical for one community to 
shift its burdens onto the shoul- 
ders of another.” 

“Oh, I don’t know. Colonel,” 
Hawkins couldn’t help saying. 
“It’s only a kind of invasion. 
And this kind is peaceable, at 
least.” 

"Pah!” spat Bell. “War is a 
matter of dire necessity and it’s 
the same for both sides. But the 
future never made war on us.” 

L INDSAY looked even more 
professorial as he leaned for- 
ward slightly into the light of 
the stove. “This was necessary. 
If it hadn’t been done in our 



THE DEPARTED 



101 



day and age, there probably 
wouldn’t have been a future, any- 
way. And the future will know 
it. This future now knows about 
us. We’re a part of history to 
them. That’s why ohr time only 
chose up to a thousand years, 
with the time carefully spaced 
out. Don’t forget, little groups 
like us have been arriving for 
several centuries now.” 

Bell stirred again at the easy 
confidence of the period of their 
projection. “You seem to be well 
acquainted with all this.” 

Lindsay coughed self-effacing- 
ly. “Well, I am. You see, I’m — I 
was, that is — a geriatrician.” 

To men of a previous genera- 
tion, the word wouldn’t have 
been so familiar. But even old 
Ez knew what it meant. 

“One of the enemy, eh?” he 
wheezed. 

T INDSAY smiled uneasily. 

“Would you have preferred 
the Eskimo way, being turned out 
into the snow?” 

“Wouldn’t have been much dif- 
ferent,” said Hasse. 

“This way,” Lindsay retorted, 
“we have a chance to live out the 
rest of our lives. We're preju- 
diced because we’re the ones it 
happened to. It was bad enough 
before the Global War. After- 
ward, with so much soil poisoned, 
so many mouths to feed, some- 
thing drastic had to be done.” 



“They should have had com- 
pulsory sterilization,” declared 
Bell. “That was the practical so- 
lution.” 

“But that would have been un- 
ethical, an infringement of fun- 
damental human rights. Anyway, 
it wasn’t the number of people 
that mattered. It was the num- 
ber of unproductive people. We 
were the problem.” 

“I was still working as well as 
ever,” said Green quietly. 

“As quickly?” Lindsay asked 
just as quietly. 

“I was a craftsman.” 

“And I was a scholar. But there 
had to be one time for every- 
body. I was thinking in the last 
few years that I was really be- 
ginning to know my subject at 
last. And now . His voice 
faltered. “This, in a way, solves 
all the problems I ever grappled 
with. Funny how the human race 
always seems to turn up with an 
answer to its problems just in 
time. Come to think of it, being 
able to send people on a one-way 
trip into the future wasn’t good 
for much else, was it?” 

“The future!” Green repeated, 
his slow voice unexpectedly ve- 
hement. “I don’t want to be in 
the future. The present was bad 
enough. Everything speeded up 
— quicker and quicker every 
year.” 

Hasse had been craning his 
neck, surveying the darkness. 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I’m beginning to think there’s 
something phony about this, af- 
ter all. If the future had been 
expecting us, like Lindsay says, 
wouldn’t they have got this area 
all fixed up? But I can’t see sign 
of anything. No lights — nothing.” 

A SUDDEN thought came to 
Hawkins. Perhaps the future 
had resented the influx of totter- 
ing immigrants from the past. 
Perhaps they’d developed the 
time-projecting principle, found 
a way of diverting them into 
some limbo that was neither 
past, present nor future. 

“Jeez!” said Ez. “I’ve slept in 
the open more nights than not, 
but it was never as cold as this. 
If only I was tired and cold, in- 
stead of just cold, I might at 
least be able to get some shut- 
eye.” 

Yes, that was a problem for 
them all, thought Hawkins. It 
seemed to symbolize their situ- 
ation. They had been sent on 
their way one sunny morning at 
nine o’clock, straight into a dark 
and bitter future night. He re- 
membered an item of their com- 
munal pack, fumbled in its 
depths, among the first-aid 
equipment and emergency ra- 
tions. He found what he was 
looking for and brought it out. 

He smiled at the grotesque le- 
gality of it. The label read: Sup- 
plied Duty-Free for Departers. 



For Medicinal Purposes Only. 
He screwed out the cork and saw 
old Ez’s rheumy eyes look up 
and glow at the familiar sound. 

“Well,” said Hawkins, “since 
it’s obviously impossible to make 
a move before dawn, we might as 
well have something to warm us 
up.” He handed the bottle 
around. 

Only Green, when his turn 
came, hesitated. “I — I don’t, that 
is, I never — ” 

“Medicinal,” Hawkins inter- 
rupted reassuringly. 

Green nodded gratefully and 
took a swig. 

How we cling, thought Haw- 
kins, to our little canons of re- 
spectability — even now! He took 
a gulp himself, recorked the bot- 
tle and stowed it back in the bag. 
Ez smacked his lips expressively 
and looked beseechingly at him. 
Hawkins rezipped the bag, feel- 
ing a childish pleasure in the 
meager power his office gave him. 
There was something in being a 
leader of men. Perhaps he’d 
missed his vocation and the little 
tin gods at the departure center 
had seen his true worth, his la- 
tent qualities. He smiled. “Haw- 
kins,” he told himself, “you never 
did have a head for liquor.” 

But his thoughts ran on. What 
a stupid game it was, a stupid 
game for stupid old men. He 
could picture the serious reason- 
ing that had gone into it all — the

endless reports from sub-com- 
mittees, the graphs, the charts. 
The doctrine of social workers: 
“We must ensure that the De- 
parters have a proper sense of 
purpose. They mustn’t feel — un- 
wanted. They must have a spirit 
of unity.” That was what they 
had said to him and the others. 
But wasn’t it the occupational 
disease of old people to feel un- 
wanted? And weren’t they un- 
wanted? 

He himself had been living for 
thirty years on a reputation, in- 
cluded in every anthology of liv- 
ing poets — simply because he had 
still been living. He thought of 
the little party of admirers who 
had met at his place the night 
before departure, of how they 
had made half-hearted jokes 
about his being the first poet ac- 
tually to meet posterity. 

Someone had slipped a copy 
of his first book in his pocket 
and winked and said, “First edi- 
tion. Be worth a fortune in the 
future.” He felt it in his pocket, 
thought of being a poet, thought 
of posterity, and found that he 
didn't care two hoots. 

17 Z had started on a mouth or- 
gan, playing plaintive old 
hobo songs that had been hoary 
even in 1990. The wiry, wily old 
bird played them with gusto— 
and very badly. The others stir- 
red angrily and told him to lay 



off, but he stopped only to wheeze 
that he wasn’t keeping anyone 
awake, was he, and went right 
on playing. The defiant strains 
of Hallelujah, I'm a Bum and 
The Big Rock Candy Mountain 
went fading into the black empti- 
ness around them. 

No one could play quite as 
badly as that by accident, 
thought Hawkins. Its badness 
was a work of art in itself. 

Hawkins gave a sigh of capi- 
tulation and reached in the bag 
again. Ez lowered the mouth or- 
gan and, as the bottle came 
around again, he put the instru- 
ment away with a grin of tri- 
umph. 

Hawkins put the empty bottle 
back in the bag. Protected now 
against the coldness of the night 
and the chill of their thoughts, 
the little group huddled closer 
to the stove and settled down to 
await the dawn. One by one, 
they fell asleep. Only Hawkins 
remained awake, not because he 
was leader, but because he was 
used to brooding through the 
long, dark hours of the night. 

But even so, dawn was a long 
time in coming. At the first gray 
relief from darkness, the others 
were all awake. Stretching, grum- 
bling, they tottered to their feet. 
The grayness began taking on 
undertones of pink. 

The sight made Hawkins feel 
even colder. 



THE DEPARTED

“Jeez!" cried Ez. 

In the wan light, the landscape 
was desolate. Back in 1990, it 
had been a pleasant enough spot, 
open green country that had es- 
caped the ravages of war. But 
this was worse than the rubble 
of war. For here, as far as the 
eye could see in the half-light, 
was no sign of human habitation, 
no sign of anything. It was a 
bare, ashen desert. 

"Not even a blade of grass,” 
said Hasse in an awed voice. 

Green began to sway and 
moan, his eyes rolling back. His 
lips moved. "And there shall 
come great desolation upon the 
Earth . 

“God!” muttered Lindsay. 

Hasse wheeled on him, his face 
twitching. "It was a hoax. I 
should have known better than 
to believe you damned experts. 
Why didn’t you just kill us?” 
He stumbled toward the mild- 
featured Lindsay. His bony fin- 
gers clawed at Lindsay’s coat 
collar, his throat. 

"Stop that!” shouted Hawkins, 
surprising himself by the note 
of authority in his voice. It as- 
tonished him even more that 
Hasse took his hands away. But 
his face was still filled with bit- 
terness and loathing. 

"He didn’t do it,” said Haw- 
kins. "It’s not his fault.” He 
could see from Lindsay’s face 
that this — this desolation had 



come as much a shock to him as 
to the rest of them. 

“What do you make of it?” 
he asked the geriatrist. 

L INDSAY rubbed the heel of 
a hand across his brow. “I 
don’t know. I really don’t know. 
This is out of my department.” 
“Well, there’s no use moaning 
about it,” said Bell stiffly. “If 
things have gone wrong, we shall 
have to make our plans accord- 
ingly.” In his voice was the im- 
memorial fatalism of the military 
man, stoically carrying on de- 
spite the incompetence of the 
armorers or supply men behind 
the front. Hawkins was grateful 
for the sobering effect of it. 

“The city,” Bell continued, 
"used to lie over there beyond 
the hills.” But his pointing arm 
traversed a whole circle before 
it paused uncertainly and drop- 
ped. "There — there aren’t even 
hills any more.” 

It was Ez who offered the only 
realistic suggestion. “Well, there’s 
no help standing here in the cold. 
I’m for walking, now it’s light.” 
"Sure,” agreed Hawkins. 
“Somewhere there’ll be a town 
and people.” The only question 
was — where? No direction looked 
any less forbidding than the rest. 
“We’ll travel east,” he said firm- 
ly. At least they’d have the Sun 
in their faces — what there was of 
it. 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Nobody objected. Silently, they 
turned their faces to the Sun. 
Hawkins stopped only to turn 
the stove off and swing it in the 
cold air till it was cool. Then he 
stowed it in his bag and slung it 
over his shoulder. The others 
slung on their smaller ration 
bags. And then they were walk- 
ing. 

Hawkins knew why they were 
walking, knew the thought that 
was in the minds of all of them, 
because it was in his mind, too. 
They would go on and on, trudg- 
ing through this wilderness until 
they became too tired to notice 
the cold and the desolation, until 
they dropped in exhaustion, and 
that would be the end. It would 
be release. 

And so they tottered forth to- 
ward the red wintry Sun while 
it slowly rose. 

Hawkins understood two things 
as they stumbled along. The first 
brought a smile to his lips. He 
knew now, as the communal bag 
weighed heavily on his shoulders, 
just why they had chosen him as 
leader. Not because he was a 
bora leader — but simply and bru- 
tally because he was the strong- 
est. The second explained why 
they had passed Bell over. For 
he walked with a limp. He did 
his best to conceal it, Hawkins 
saw, and did his best to conceal 
that he was concealing it, but it 
was too apparent. 



After they had gone a short 
way, he stumbled on a rough 
piece of ground, spun and fell. 
His game leg stuck out help- 
lessly, as if it weren’t a part of 
him. It wasn’t, Hawkins real- 
ized, as he stooped to help him 
up. His eyes and Bell’s met for 
an instant. And for an instant, 
the barricade of military self- 
control dropped and the man 
looked out. A man who admitted 
his disability and smiled briefly 
in gratitude at being helped. And 
then he was on his feet and dust- 
ing himself off. 

“Thank you,” he said stiffly. 
“That won’t happen again.” The 
barricade was up again. But 
Hawkins felt better and sensed 
that Bell did, too. 

T HE Sun cleared the horizon 
finally and seemed to hang 
there like a great bladder of 
blood. A wind rose now and pick- 
ed up the dust, sending it in 
dismal eddies across the land- 
scape. They went on, their pace 
gradually slowing. Hawkins be- 
gan to feel the approach of ulti- 
mate exhaustion. 

They had been going up a 
slight incline and Hawkins had 
not noticed it. And they had 
passed through a cleft in the 
bare rock. And below them . 
“Look, a real city!” 
“Hallelujah!” 

It stood in the shallow valley 



THE DEPARTED

below them, less than a mile 
away. 

And they were running, stag- 
gering, stumbling toward it, like 
men in a desert tottering toward 
the mirage of an oasis. 

They were almost there before 
they stopped on a single impulse, 
gasping for breath. 

“ But there’s nobody there." 

They felt it blowing out of the 
city, a wind of ageless antiquity. 
The city was built of uniform, 
hard, block stone and its build- 
ings were still standing, undam- 
aged. But they looked as if they 
had been buffed smooth by a 
giant hand. And that was the 
hand of time, of centuries ... of 
eons. 

They approached in awed si- 
lence, walking slowly — almost 
reverently. 

They passed down a long street 
like mourners at a funeral. 

“Wait,” said Hawkins. His 
voice rang almost blasphemous- 
ly in the silence. “Something 
moved there.” He pointed at a 
glint of light between two build- 
ings. 

It was a fountain. In the age- 
old silence of the city, it played, 
pumping from some cistern un- 
derground. Watching it, grateful 
for some sign of movement, they 
did not notice the figure seated 
under a piece of eroded statu- 
ary. When it stirred slightly, they 
all jumped and faced it with a 



sharp drawing-in of breath. 

“My God!” breathed Lindsay. 

The figure was small. It looked 
like a five-month fetus, its head 
great and wrinkled and hairless. 
Its eyes looked upon them with- 
out wonder — without interest 
even. It seemed not to be hostile. 
It seemed incapable of hostility. 

Hawkins advanced falteringly 
toward it. He was conscious of 
the rest shuffling behind him, 
grouping at his back. 

He said, “Good morning.” 

T HE creature did not speak. It 
inclined its head very slightly, 
but that might have been coin- 
cidental. 

Hawkins felt silly, but he add- 
ed, “Greetings,” feeling that to be 
more formal and thus more cor- 
rect in a situation like this. “We 
come from the past.” 

Hasse grumbled in his ear, 
“We’re not on Earth at all. We’ve 
been shifted in space, not time. 
This is Mars, I bet.” 

Still the creature before them 
did not speak. The only expres- 
sion in its eyes was one of utter 
weariness. 

“This is Mars,” Hasse said 
again, eagerly. “It’s colder on 
Mars. I remember reading — ” 
“This isn’t Mars,” stated Haw- 
kins. “The Sun wouldn’t look as 
big as this on Mars. This is 
Earth, all right — but in God 
knows what remote future. Some- 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thing must have gone wrong with 
the projector. Or maybe the calli- 
bration is only window dressing 
or guesswork. This isn’t seven 
hundred and fifty years in the 
future. It’s millions!” 

“And that, then?” Lindsay 
said, gesturing at the hunched-up 
figure by the fountain. 

“Jeez!” gasped Ez. “He looks 
a thousand years old.” 

“Why doesn’t he speak?” 
Hasse asked. 

“Perhaps he hasn’t anyone to 
speak to any more,” said Lindsay 
thoughtfully. 

“We’re here. He could speak 
to us.” 

“In English?” 

The thought that a language 
called English had faded back in 
the depths of time shocked Haw- 
kins at first, then made him feel 
strangely glad, light-hearted, re- 
lieved at last of a heavy burden. 
He remembered all that wrestling 
with words to convey this or that 
shade of meaning. Once it had 
seemed so important, so desper- 
ately important. But now it took 
its insignificant place in the dust 
of the ages. All the striving, all 
the poetry and music, all the 
machines, all the great philoso- 
phies came in the end to this — an 
old, old man, sitting in front of 
a fountain, watching the waters 
playing. 

Was that all? Had Man never 
done all those things he was go- 



ing to do? Was he never to find 
the secret at the heart of atom 
and universe, send ships to the 
stars, become wholly good, whol- 
ly wise? 

Lindsay began to laugh. He 
stopped to gasp, “Age! I never 
knew what the word meant.” 
Hawkins dazedly knew that 
that was the way they were all 
feeling. Old men cast out from a 
young and struggling world, they 
were the youngest ones alive — by 
years, centuries, eons! 

A LL of them straightened, 
their backs unbent from the 
load of years. And when Ez pull- 
ed out his mouth organ, they 
skipped to the music like six- 
year-olds. Even Bell. Even 
Green. They joined in the chorus 
like kids at a picnic. 

“For an old man he is old. 

And an old man he is gray, 

But a young man’s heart is full 
of love. 

Get away, old man, get away!” 
Hawkins frowned uncomfort- 
ably for a moment, feeling the 
irreverence of it. After all, that 
man might be the last man — the 
very last. 

But the figure seemed not to 
hear them. It just sat there, look- 
ing into the fountain, as unnotic- 
ing as an old man on a park 
bench might be of children run- 
ning and playing around him.

than being on the open market,

Belly Rave or its local equiva- 
lent — and every city has one — 
is where those without contract 
status live, if existence in the 
wretched squalor of those brawl-

are the neglected result of G-M-

Charles M undin, a criminal 
lawyer, starving because he was 
not fortunate enough to be born 
into one of the corporate-law 
dynasties, has had only one case, 
that of: 




GLADIATOR AT LAW 



111 



Norvell Bligh , whose specialty 
is dreaming up bloody events for 
Field Days, the future equivalent 
of Roman circuses, and who is 
being nagged by his wife to adopt 
her daughter Alexandra, born in 
Belly Rave of a previous mar- 
riage. Bligh, however, has been 
doublecrossed into loss of con- 
tract status and his bubble house, 
and has been moved into Belly 
Rave by a police convoy. Mean- 
while, Mundin finds himself the 
recipient of a doubtful political 
favor, the case of: 

Norma and Don Lavin, off- 
spring of the Lavin who invented 
the bubble house and whose ini- 
tial is the L of G-M-L Homes. 
Through legal trickery after their 
father's death, Norma and Don’s 
25 per cent share of all G-M-L 
stock has been tied up .. and 
Don, the victim of severe con- 
ditioning that has left him va- 
cant-eyed, is unable to remember 
where the stocks are or even to 
discuss the matter. He and his 
sister Norma live in Belly Rave 
with : 

Ryan, an old-time corporation 
lawyer, who has ruined himself 
through his addiction to the 
opiate, yen pox. He can still act 
as attorney of record and stra- 
tegist, however, while Mundin 
does the legwork. The new com- 
bination evidently worries G-M- 
L, for Norma disappears. 

Lana , boss of the juvenile Bel- 



ly Rave gang known as the Wab- 
bits, will do practically anything 
for a price, including major sur- 
gery on a face with a broken bot- 
tle. Her scouts confirm Mundin’s 
suspicion that Norma has been 
snatched. Coached by Ryan, 
Mundin visits the New York 
Parimutuel Stock Exchange. By 
luck, shrewdness and the illegal 
assistance of a broker, he man- 
ages to buy one share of G-M-L 
common stock. This makes Mun- 
din eligible to attend the G-M-L 
stockholders’ meeting. He man- 
ages to interest three important 
stockholders in his tale of repre- 
senting a lost 25% of the stock, 
for they are eager to slip a knife 
into the existing directorate. He 
further uses them to force the re- 
lease of Norma Lavin, who has 
become as important to Mundin 
as the case itself. 

Hubble, Coett and Nelson, the 
three stockholders whose aid 
Mundin had enlisted, being hard- 
headed, realistic financial raiders, 
will back him only if he produces 
the huge block of G-M-L shares 
he has been talking about. They 
give him until morning to do so. 
But how do you go about finding 
it when the only person who 
knows where it is goes into con- 
vulsions when it’s mentioned — 
and when conditioning or de- 
conditioning is a quasi -legal pro- 
cess, reserved exclusively to the 
state for treatment of criminals,

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and a heinous crime in private 
practice? 

XVII 

I T was a ghastly night. Norma 
Lavin snapped, “You could 
have stalled them.” 

“Stalled them how?” Mundin 
asked, needled into snapping 
back at her. “One hint of inde- 
cision and they’d have pulled 
out.” 

“And where did you think we’d 
find the stock?” 

He looked hopefully at Ryan. 
“What about the possibility of 
duplicate certificates?” 

“Overnight?” Ryan said. “A 
thing like that takes weeks — as- 
suming there’s no hitch, and 
G-M-L will create as many hitch- 
es as they can — and then there 
is still the question of Don’s con- 
ditioning against remembering 
where the stock is and being able 
to vote it.” 

He was jittering badly, al- 
though he had doped himself al- 
most blind during the argument. 
He took another yen pox pill and 
his eyes began to close. 

“That’s great,” Mundin grum- 
bled. “Now he’s no help.” 

Norma said contemptuously, 
“And you are, I suppose. At least 
he didn’t make any stupid pro- 
mises.” 

“Maybe Don can give us a 
hint. One is all we’d need. They 



might not have blocked all his 
memories about — ” 

“Leave him alone! You said 
you’d produce the stock. All 
right, produce it, but not by tor- 
menting him!” 

Mundin knew it was desperate 
and cruel when he pushed past 
her and shook the boy awake, 
but at the very first question, 
Don Lavin’s eyes stretched wide 
in terror and he stammered, “K- 
k-k-k-k-” and began to cry. 

“I’m sorry,” Mundin said in- 
adequately and went back into 
the ramshackle living room while 
she glared at him and tried to 
calm her frightened brother. 
“Now what?” he asked Ryan. 

The old attorney roused slight- 
ly. “Tellmtruth,” he mumbled. 

“What?” Mundin exclaimed. 
“Who? About what?” 
“Hubblenthothers. ‘Bou’ Don. 
Stockenconditionnn.” 

Revolted, Mundin watched the 
drugged lawyer slide back into 
his opiate dreamworld, where 
problems like this could be solv- 
ed magically just by telling the 
truth. It was idiotic and he 
didn’t give the suggestion an- 
other thought. There had to be 
a way out. All they had to do 
was think of one. 

But Ryan was doped and Don 
Lavin had fallen into an easy 
sleep again, protected by his con- 
ditioning as much against re- 
sidual terror after questioning as 



GLADIATOR AT LAW

from talking or doing anything 
about his G-M-L shares, and 
Norma was furious at Mundin. 

When morning came, he had 
blearily decided to do what he 
should have done in the first 
place — somehow put off Hubble, 
Coett and Nelson. Ryan, how- 
ever, insisted that he bring Don 
along just in case. 

A T Hubble’s house, Mundin 
tried to be evasive, but Coett 
said impatiently, “Look, this rep- 
resents a huge gamble for us. 
If you’ve just been bluffing and 
haven’t got the stock, come right 
out and say so, but don’t try 
using excuses on us — we know 
them all.” 

And Mundin, knowing he was 
blowing the case, hating himself 
because he hadn’t come up with 
the solution, told them the truth. 

“How do we know this isn’t 
another stall?” demanded Nel- 
son. 

“Ask Don where the stock is,” 
Mundin said tiredly. 

They did, and got the same 
fright reaction, and the same an- 
ger from Norma, and Hubble ad- 
mitted uncomfortably, “It’s real, 
all right. Nobody could imitate 
conditioning that well.” 

“And there’s the way Arnold 
acted at the meeting,” Coett add- 
ed. “He knew the Lavin stock 
was no phony.” 

Mundin listened to them in be- 



wilderment. Drugged or not, Ry- 
an was the better lawyer; he had 
come up with the right answer. 
They had accepted the shameful 
truth where they had rejected 
excuses and delays, and now they 
were discussing ways and means, 
shrewdly, clear-headedly, as if 
conditioning were just another 
problem in finance. 

“We could get duplicate cer- 
tificates,” Mundin offered, which 
was accepted as a possibility 
when everything else failed; they 
shared Ryan’s belief that G-M- 
L would put every obstacle in 
their way. 

“I know a doctor,” Hubble said 
quietly. 

Coett and Nelson nodded as 
though a vote had been taken. 

“But deconditioning is illegal!” 
Mundin protested. “We can’t be 
parties to — ” 

“Hah!” Norma snorted in 
scorn. 

“Who said anything about de- 
conditioning?” asked Hubble. 
“The boy needs an operation, 
that’s all.” 

So Don Lavin had himself a 
brain tumor. A highly reputable 
diagnostician analyzed it as a 
spongioblastoma, the commonest 
and most malignant of the intra- 
cranial gliomas. He recommend- 
ed immediate surgery and then 
bought himself a new Rolls 
’copter with power doors, power 
windows, ramp and steering.

OAtAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The surgeon he suggested was 
in Wichita and had a private 
hospital. He extirpated the spon- 
gioblastoma — or at least the 
hospital Tissue Committee exam- 
ined what he said he had re- 
moved from Don Lavin’s brain, 
and this indisputably was spon- 
gioblastoma multiforms, consist- 
ing of round, elongated and 
piriform cells, characteristically 
recalling the varied cytological 
picture in osteogenic sarcoma of 
bone. 

The surgeon then put down 
a sizable deposit for a new wing 
for his hospital. 

C hronically suspicious, 
Norma scowled down at her 
brother, mumbling under the last 
of the anesthesia. She said to 
Mundin, “He might have left 
him an idiot. What better way to 
cover his tracks?” 

Mundin sighed. They had, 
purely on her insistence, watched 
the surgery. The lights, the steri- 
lizers, the hole saw. The wisp 
of scorched smell from the bone, 
the nerve - wrenching moment 
when the disk of skull lifted out. 
Insertion of anode and cathode 
needles, minute electroshocks 
that smashed this pattern, blur- 
red that 'memory, shattered one 
or another reflex into neuronic 
rubble. The hours before of end- 
less tests and questions, the strobe 
flickers in Don’s eyes, the miles

of EEG tape, the mapping of 
Don's brain and its workings. 

Norvell Bligh, handy little 
man, looked in. “Doctor’s com- 
ing,” he said and, faithful little 
man, resumed his post outside 
the door. 

Dr. Niessen asked them, “Any- 
thing yet?” 

Don chose that moment to 
open his eyes and smile at Nor- 
ma. “Hello, Sis. It feels better 
now.” Norma burst into tears and 
Dr. Niessen looked mightily re- 
lieved. 

“Check the blockage,” the doc- 
tor suggested to Mundin. “We 
can find out now if we’ve done it.” 

Don said, “The stock? Safe- 
deposit box 27,993, Coshocton 
First National. Identification — 
picture of me, my fingerprints, 
code phrase, “Gray, my friend, 
is all theory and green life’s gold- 
en tree’. ” He explained chattily, 
“Goethe. Dad used to say that 
one a lot after they put the boot 
to him. It used to cheer him up 
a little.” 

Dr. Niessen asked formally, 
“Is that essentially it?” 

Norma choked and said, “Have 
you got it all back, Don? All?” 

Her brother winced. “Oy, have 
I ! Including the time they worked 
on me. That part I don’t want 
to remember.” 

The doctor muttered, “Bar- 
barous. We’re all lawbreakers 
here, but I’m glad of it in this

case. Mr. Kozloff — ” That was 
Don’s pseudonym — “are you able 
to verify my conjecture that 
flicker-feedback was the princi- 
pal means employed?” 

“I guess so, if flicker -feedback 
is them shining a light in your 
eyes and you go into convul- 
sions.” 

“That’s it. Well, Mr. Kozloff, I 
think you’ve recovered from your 
tumor. One of the staff physicians 
will check you for traveling. 
Come back if there’s anything 
new. In these spongioblastomas, 
there is always a slight possibility 
that some malignant tissue was 
overlooked. And if you can pos- 
sibly arrange it, Mr. Kozloff, 
please don’t bring your sister.” 
Bligh opened the door for him. 
Mundin followed him out into 
the corridor for a smoke and re- 
fuge from the touching recon- 
ciliation scene. But he could hear 
it even out there. 

T HE Columbus manager of 
Brinks-Fargo looked skepti- 
cal. “Now have I got this 
straight? Armored truck from 
here to Coshocton First National, 
guarded pickup of securities from 
there and immediate overland 
trip to New York, you four rid- 
ing all the way. Right?” 
“Right,” Mundin said. 
“Twelve thousand, five hun- 
dred dollars,” the manager said 
after some scribbling. “For our 



biggest and best, with six guards.” 

'It was paid. 

The pickup went off smoothly. 
A conditioned clerk handed over 
the little box in which were cer- 
tificates of Don Lavin’s fantastic 
claim to 25 per cent of G-M-L. 

Mundin examined them won- 
deringly as the armored, eight- 
wheeled land cruiser rolled 
bumpily through the streets of 
Coshocton. Three and one-half 
billion dollars at par, he kept 
saying to himself. Three and one- 
half billion dollars at par. He 
felt numb. 

Don, who had been revealed by 
conditioning as a happy-go-lucky 
kid, whispered to him, “Confi- 
dentially, I’d swap those things 
for a lifetime lease on a bubble 
house and fifty bucks a week 
pocket money. But Norma — you 
know. And maybe she’s right. The 
responsibility and everything,” 
he added vaguely. 

Norvell Bligh, inevitably, was 
the one sitting uncomfortably on 
a couple of folded money sacks. 
Only three welded-steel seats in 
the locked middle compartment 
where they rode as passengers. 
He hoped the ride would go on 
forever, jolts to the spine and all. 
He was working. 

Hubble said, when they ar- 
rived, “Did it work, Don?” 

Coett said, “If that sawbones 
couldn’t deliver after all his big 
talk — ” 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Nelson said, “I hope it didn’t 
cost too much — ” 

“I’m all right, thanks,’’ Don 
Lavin said. 

“And,” Mundin told them 
casually, “we came back through 
Coshocton.” 

They examined the stock cer- 
tificates with awe, then gloating. 

“We’re in,” Coett said deci- 
sively, “as of the next stock- 
holders’ meeting. Three months 
— plenty of time to shake the firm 
and pick up all we need for a 
majority. My God, a majority! 
Gentlemen, I move we now turn 
this operation over to Mr. Mun- 
din. He understands us and we 
have, in addition to our usual 
activities, to pick up stock as it 
becomes available. Mr. Mundin, 
with an expense account of seven 
hundred and fifty thousand, will 
easily see to it that it does be- 
come available, I am sure.” 

C OETT looked like some aged,. 

still-ferocious jungle preda- 
tor, and quite suddenly Mundin 
began to loathe him. The tactics, 
he thought, were disgusting and 
anti-social. Thus far, he had been 
persuaded by their papa-knows- 
best attitude and by the fact that 
Don Lavin, conditioned, had been 
his only talking point. Decondi- 
tioned and in possession of his 
stock certificates now . 

“I’ve been meaning to ask you 
gentlemen whether the smear 



against G-M-L is absolutely es- 
sential,” Mundin said. 

They were quite ready for him. 
Coett snapped, “That’s a closed 
question, Mundin. I’m sure Mr. 
Lavin realizes that we’re doing 
what’s best for him. Don’t you, 
Don?” 

The boy said, “I don’t really 
give a damn, Mr. Coett. Talk to 
Sis. You’ll have to, anyway.” 

Norma was undecided. “Old 
Ryan says your plans are quite 
routine under the circumstances 
and I have a great deal of faith 
in him. I suppose — I suppose the 
important thing is to get it done." 

Coett spread his hands. 
“There’s your answer, Mundin. 
Now about — ” 

“Hold it, please,” said Mundin. 
“I’m still not — ” 

“Mundin,” Coett broke in 
sharply, “will you, for God’s sake, 
come to your senses? This thing 
is still a gamble and it’s our 
money everybody’s gambling 
with.” 

“Absurd quibbles about de- 
stroying some paper values,” Nel- 
son sniffed. “You don’t under- 
stand these things. And I heartily 
endorse Mr. Coett’s reminder that 
we are putting up the capital to 
enable Mr. Lavin to realize his 
claim of interest.” 

“Smear’s the word,” Mundin 
said after a pause, feeling heavy- 
hearted. 

“Fine,” agreed young Hubble, 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



117 



but Mundin thought there was 
a twist to his mouth when he 
said it. 

“Now,” said Coett, “it is con- 
ceivable that Green, Charles- 
worth may take an interest in the 
contemplated operation. If they 
should show up, Mundin, don’t 
try to handle it yourself. Buck it 
to us. They have the reputation 
of not dealing with intermedi- 
aries.” 

“Noted,” Mundin said. Green, 
Charlesworth. Insurance and 
bankers’ bankers. Old man Ryan 
had mentioned them. 

“Then we’re ready to rip and 
tear,” said Coett. “Go get ’em, 
Mundin. You’ve got three months 
and seven hundred and fifty 
thousand dollars to get them 
with.” 

Mundin nodded, but he felt 
shaky inside. It didn’t seem like 
much against the fourteen bil- 
lion dollars G-M-L had. 

XVIII 

O NE month after the go-ahead, 
Del Dworcas, Regular Re- 
publican county committee chair- 
man, stood incredulously before 
an office door. The sign said: 

RYAN & MUNDIN 
ATTORNEYS AT LAW 

The office occupied a solid floor 
through of a very good building. 



All he knew, standing there, was 
that Charles Mundin, his fore- 
doomed candidate in the 27th 
ward, had first become inacces- 
sible to him and then had moved 
and then had formed a partner- 
ship with somebody named Ryan 
and then — but there the stories 
became incredible. Dworcas had 
to check for himself. 

He took several long, deep 
breaths before he pushed the door 
open and announced himself to 
a ripely curved blonde recep- 
tionist. 

“Pleased be seated, Mr. Dwor- 
cas,” the girl cooed. “Mr. Mun- 
din asked me to tell you that 
you’ll be the very next person 
he sees.” 

The dozen or so other indivi- 
duals in the waiting room glared 
at Del Dworcas. However, being 
a professional politician, he had 
no difficulty in striking up a con- 
versation with the fellows nearest 
him. 

One was a petrochemist who 
understood there were consultant 
jobs opening up at Ryan & Mun- 
din. Another was a publishers’ 
bright young man who thought 
there must be a whale of a story 
in old man Ryan’s sensational 
comeback and stood ready to 
sign it up. The others were easy 
enough to tag — a couple of 
crackpots, two attorneys obvious- 
ly seeking affiliation with the 
new firm, a handful of persons 



118 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



who seemed to be in the market 
for lawyers, and had suddenly 
come to think that it might be a 
good idea to retain Ryan 8s 
Mundin. 

Nobody in the waiting room 
seemed to have any idea of what, 
if anything, was going on in the 
remainder of the enormous suite. 

Dworcas — being a professional 
politician — was able to absorb in- 
formation, pump for more, evalu- 
ate what he had heard and 
speculate on its meaning. But the 
answers were slight and cloudy. 
All he could make out for sure 
was that Ryan & Mundin were 
rising like a rocket and plenty of 
shrewd operators were trying to 
hitch a ride. 

At last he got the nod from the 
receptionist. A hard-faced young 
Ay-rab with a badge that said 
Guide took him in tow. 

Ryan 8c Mundin operated the 
damnedest law offices that Dwor- 
cas, in a full life, had ever seen. 
Law offices . complete with 
such eccentricities as chemistry 
labs and kitchens,, living quar- 
ters and a TV studio, rooms 
locked off from his view, and open 
rooms that he could make no 
sense of. 

D WORCAS said tentatively, 
“You must be proud to be 
working for Mr. Mundin. Of 
course you know his record with 
our Party in the 27tb — right down 



the line for Arab rights.” 

“That’s nice,” the Ay-rab said. 
“Right in here, mister.” He guid- 
ed Dworcas into a bay. It lit up 
with a shimmering violet light; 
the Ay-rab scanned a fluoroscope 
screen. “You’re clean. In that 
door.” 

“You searched me!” Dworcas 
gasped. “Me! Mr. Mundin’s old- 
est friend!” 

“That’s nice,” the Ay-rab said. 
“In that door.” 

Dworcas went through the 
door. 

“Hello, Del.” Mundin was ab- 
stractedly checking off items on 
a list. 

He said, “Excuse me,” and 
picked up an interoffice phone. 
Five minutes later, he put it 
down, glanced at Dworcas, and 
turned to another list. 

Dworcas, in cello tones, said, 
“Charles . .” 

Mundin looked at him with 
annoyance on his face. “Well?” 

Dworcas waved a finger at 
him, smiling. “Charlie, you’re not 
treating me right. You really 
aren’t.” 

“Look, Del, business has pick- 
ed up,” said Mundin tiredly. 
“I’m busy. What do you want?” 

“Nice office you’ve got. G-M-L 
fix it for you?” 

“What do you think?” 

Dworcas retained his smile. 
“Remember who got you in with 
G-M-L?”

“You’ve got a point,” Mundin 
conceded unwillingly. “It isn’t 
going to do you much good, 
though. I haven’t got time for 
favors. Some other time, I’ll lis- 
ten closer,” 

“I want you to listen now, 
Charlie. I want you to recon- 
sider on the race.” 

Mundin stared. “Run for the 
Council?” 

“I know it sounds like small 
potatoes. But it can lead to big 
ones, Charlie. You can do it. And 
what about us? You owe me — the 
Party — all of us something for 
putting you on to the Lavins. Is 
this the time to let us down? I’m 
not too proud to beg if I have to. 
Stick with the Party, boy! We 
can make a real race of it. Media 
space and time — rallies — litera- 
ture — sound trucks — street 
meetings — we’re in the running 
again, boy!” 

“Sorry, Del," Mundin said pa- 
tiently. 

“Charlie!” 

Mundin looked exasperated. 
“Del, you old crook, just what 
are you up to now? Suppose I did 
sink some time and some dough 
into the election — which I won’t. 
But suppose I did. You’d be in 
serious trouble if we won. Del. 
This is the year when the Regu- 
lars take a fall in the Council and 
the Reforms take a fall in the 
Statewide. What are you going 
to do, break the agreement?” 



T HE politician leaned forward, 
his face completely changed. 
“I underestimated you, Charlie. 
I’ll tell you the God’s truth. No, 
normally I wouldn’t break the 
agreement; I’d be crazy. But 
something’s on the fire. I never 
miss on something like this. I 
feel it through the soles of my 
feet.” 

He had Mundin’s full atten- 
tion now. “What do you feel?” 
Dworcas shrugged. “Little 
things. Jimmy Lyons, for in- 
stance. Remember him — the cap- 
tain’s man at the precinct?” 
“Sure.” 

“He isn’t any more. Captain 
Kowalik transferred him out to 
Belly Rave. Why? I don’t know 
why, Charlie. Jimmy had it com- 
ing to him, sure. But why did it 
happen? And what’s happening 
to Kowalik? He’s losing weight. 
He can’t sleep nights. I asked him 
why and he wouldn’t tell me. So 
I asked somebody else and I 
found out. Kowalik’s trouble is 
that Commissioner Sabbatino 
doesn’t talk to him any more.” 
“And what’s the matter with 
Sabbatino?” Mundin was play- 
ing with a pencil. 

“Don’t kid me, Charlie. Sab- 
batino’s trouble is a man named 
Wheeler, who had a long, long 
talk with him one day. I don’t 
know what about. But I know 
Wheeler works for Hubble and 
Hubble is one of your clients.” 



120

Mundin put the pencil down. 
“So what else is new?” he asked. 

“Don’t joke, Charlie. What 
about the Ay-rabs? There’s a 
crazy rumor they’re all going to 
be moved into G-M-L Homes. 
The old folks don’t like the idea. 
Some of the young folks do, so 
there are family fights. A dozen 
riot calls a day in the 27th. So 
I asked my brother Arnie, the 
engineer with G-M-L. You met 
him, you know what a fathead he 
is. But even he feels something in 
his organization. What do we 
feel, Charlie?” 

A secretary person — with a 
start, Dworcas recognized his 
brother’s friend, Bligh — put his 
head in the door. “Excuse me, 
Mr. Mundin, but they phoned 
from the landing stage that 
they’re holding the D.C. ’copter 
for you.” 

Mundin nodded. “Look, thank 
them, Norvie, and ask them if 
they can give me five more 
minutes. I’ll be free shortly.” He 
glanced at Del Dworcas. 

Dworcas said, “You’re busy, 
Charlie. I’ll see you some other 
time. I just want you to remem- 
ber that I’m leveling with you.” 

“Good-by, Del,” Mundin said 
cordially. 

Then to Bligh, after Dworcas 
was gone, he said, “Thanks, Nor- 
vie. You were very smooth. Let’s 
walk over to Mr. Ryan’s office.” 

Bligh said, “We can’t stay too 



long. The ’copter really does 
leave in twenty minutes.” 

R YAN, as usual, was snoozing 
with great dignity at his 
desk. He looked good, consider- 
ing. His yen pox pills were ra- 
tioned to him these days and he 
accepted it with good grace. His 
confusing explanation was, “As 
long as you know you can get 
your hands on them, you can say 
‘no’ most of the time. It’s when 
you can’t possibly get them that 
you’ve got to have them.” As a 
consequence, his very able brain 
had cleared and he was able to 
work for as much as an intensive 
hour at a stretch. He had evolved 
personally most of the 78 basic 
steps of tackling G-M-L. 

Mundin reported Del’s conver- 
sation carefully. In effect, it was 
that steps one through twenty- 
four were clicking nicely. 

“A very pleasant miasma of 
doubt and confusion,” Ryan de- 
clared. “I am gratified, Charles. 
There is no public-opinion poll 
as sensitive as the judgment of 
a professional politician — but we 
will, of course, continue with the 
polling as a matter of course. 
You have reason to be proud.” 
“Have I?” Mundin asked 
glumly. “Spreading doubt and 
confusion? Knifings every night 
in the 27th ward?” He felt instant 
regret as the old man’s face 
drooped. “Excuse me, Mr. Ryan. 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



121 



Perhaps I've been working too 
hard.” 

Ryan said slowly, “Yes, at the 
wrong things. You remember the 
state I was in when we first 
met?" 

Mundin did. The old man had 
been disheveled, very sick with 
withdrawal symptoms, in a 
smoke-filled Belly Rave slum. 

“It was partly Green, Charles- 
worth that brought me to that 
sorry state. Partly Green, 
Charlesworth and partly con- 
science. Don’t strain yours too 
far, Charles.” 

Mundin found himself engag- 
ed in an elaborate justification of 
the role he was playing, explain- 
ing to the gently smiling, nod- 
ding old man that of course there 
was a good end in sight, that he 
wouldn’t be touching the thing 
if it were just for money, that 
they were out to end the contract- 
rental system in G-M-L. 

Bligh touched his elbow and 
muttered, “I think Mr. Ryan is 
asleep again.” He was. “And we 
really ought to head for the ’cop- 
ter deck now.” 

They did, and took their seats 
in the big Washington-bound 
craft. Mundin said fretfully, 
“We ought to have a couple of 
executive ships of our own. 
There’s going to be more and 
more ground to cover. Put some- 
body on it, will you, Norvie?” 

Bligh made a note. 



Mundin asked, "When do you 
get in touch with Del’s brother? 
We can’t stall on it any longer. 
We’ve got to have those serial 
numbers or today’s work — and 
the whole buildup to it — is 
wasted.” 

“Tomorrow all right?” Bligh 
inquired. 

"Fine, fine.” 

H E took a briefcase from Bligh, 
shuffled through reports he 
ought to read, memoranda he 
ought to sign, notes he ought to 
expand. He irritably stuffed them 
back into the case. 

Incredibly, Bligh said to him, 
“Conscience, Charles,” and wink- 
ed. 

“You don’t know what it’s like, 
Norvie! You don’t have the re- 
sponsibility, so don’t try to kid 
me out of it. Let’s just talk; I 
don’t have to be a criminal again 
until we walk in on the museum. 
How’ve things been with you?” 
Bligh considered. “Well,” he 
said, "Virginia’s pregnant.” 
Mundin was genuinely shock- 
ed. “Norvie, I am sorry! I hope 
you’re not going to do anything 
foolish — ” 

Bligh grinned. “The kid’s 
mine. First thing I did was drag 
her to an immunochemist and get 
that settled. How’s your girl?” 
“Huh?” 

“Norma Lavin.” 

“You’re dead wrong there. 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



We can’t stand each other. And 
on my side, there’s full justi- 
fication.” 

“Sure,” said Bligh soothingly. 
“Say, can we boost the allow- 
ance for the Wabbits? Lana was 
hinting.” 

“Why not? But do you think 
it’s doing any good? A bunch of 
kids, after all. I don’t think the 
rumors they spread ever get 
over to grownups.” 

“We can test easily enough. 
Launch one through the Wabbits 
alone. See how it compares in the 
polling.” 

“Okay, Norvie, have it done. 
No raise for the Wabbits until 
then, though. How’s your foster- 
daughter, by the way?” 

"I’m almost proud of her. Came 
home five days running, beaten 
to a pulp. Sixth day, not a mark! 
She’s a Burrow Leader in the 
Wabbits now. And she closes 
her mouth when she chews and 
calls me ‘sir.’ Why, I practically 
like the little witch!” 

Mundin felt a sudden flash of 
insight. “That’s why you’re still 
living in Belly Rave, isn’t it?” 
Bligh got defensive. “Maybe 
that’s part of it. But there’s 
something to be said for Belly 
Rave. When you can install a 
water tank and a generating sys- 
tem and fix your place up — it’s 
kind of lively.” His voice rang 
with civic pride. “In our block, 
we’ve organized a real volunteer 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



police force, not one of those 
shakedown squads, and there’s 
talk in the blocks around us of 
doing the same.” 

Mundin said, “One day, who 
knows? Norvell Bligh, first mayor 
of New Belly Rave!” 

The little man was suddenly 
gray; he fiddled with the earpiece 
of his hearing aid. “Make it a 
joke if you want to,” he said, 
hurt. “The fact is they like me. 
I’m doing something for them 
— in a small way at first — and 
something has got to be done for 
these millions of outcasts. From 
the inside. I’m a funny-looking 
little man and I’m deaf and you 
automatically thought what you 
did when I said Virginia was 
pregnant. So what are you doing 
for Belly Rave, big man?” 

“Norvie, I’m sorry! I didn’t 
dream you were that serious 
about it — ” 

“Doesn’t matter. Here’s Wash- 
ington.” 

npHE Museum of the National 
Association of the Builders of 
the American Dream had once 
been a proud idea, built with the 
contributions of businessmen and 
schoolchildren. But the American 
Dream was mere history in this 
G-M-L era, like Pax Romana or 
Brittania’s rule of the waves — 
words that had meaning only for 
the dead. The Museum remained, 
as the Pyramids had, but with the 



123 



difference that the Pyramids 
needed no maintenance or staff. 
Of all this Mundin was remind- 
ed when he entered the shabby 
building and found, his way to 
the anteroom of the director’s 
office. 

The withered secretary said to 
the gentlemen from New York, 
“Dr. Proctor is a very busy man. 
You must write or telephone for 
an appointment.” 

Mundin said gently, “Please 
tell the director that it is in con- 
nection with a rather substantial 
bequest. If it isn’t convenient for 
him to see us now, we’ll be glad 
to come back at some other 
time — although we don’t expect 
to be in the city long , . .” 

The director came flying out of 
his office, beaming. 

The attorney introduced him- 
self. 

“Yes, indeed, Mr. Munsen! 
Even here, even in our remote 
and dedicated corner of the 
world, we have heard of your 
firm. Might one ask the name 
of — ” 

“Sorry.” 

“Oh, I quite understand, Mr. 
Munchkin! And the — ah — 
amount?” 

“Flexible,” Mundin said firm- 
ly. “My client has commissioned 
me to inspect the Museum and 
report to him on which depart- 
ments seem most deserving of 
additional support.” 



“Ah! Pray allow me to guide 
you, sir. Just through here is the 
Collection of — ” 

Mundin said blandly, “I think 
we would prefer to see the Hall 
of Basics first.” 

Dr. Proctor very nearly frown- 
ed. At the last minute, he chang- 
ed and merely looked confiden- 
tial. “For the general public,” he 
said, nudging Mundin. “Gim- 
micks and gadgets. Not impor- 
tant, though perhaps of some 
limited interest to the engineer, 
the sociologist, that sort of per- 
son. Now our collection of Co- 
elenterates, just through — ” 
“The Hall of Basics, please?” 
“Mr. Monkton! A tourist trap, 
I assure you. On the other hand, 
the Coelenterata — which happen 
to be my specialty, I might 
add — ” 

Mundin said sadly, “Norvell, 
I’m afraid Dr. Proctor isn’t real- 
ly interested in our client’s be- 
quest.” 

“Too bad,” Bligh said. “Well, 
luckily the ’copter’s waiting.” 

D R. Proctor sputtered and led 
them to the Hall of Basics. 
They gravely studied the spin- 
ning jenny, the sewing machine, 
the telegraph, the telephone, the 
airplane, the Model T, the atomic 
pile. 

They stopped before the G- 
M-L bubble house, beaming ap- 
provingly — except for Dr. Proc-

tor. A tourist family of five was 
hogging the descriptive plaque. 
It was a minute or so before 
they could get close enough to 
read it. 

No. 342371 

THE FIRST G-M-L HOME 
Donated by Mr. Hamilton Moffatt 
“ Father of the Bubble House ” 
This G-M-L Home, moved to 
the Museum from its original site 
in Coshocton, Ohio, was fabricated 
in the plastics factory of Donald 
Lavin. Electrical circuitry and 
mechanisms were designed and 
installed by Bernard Gorman. It 
has stood for more than five de- 
cades without a scar or a mal- 
function. Chemists and engineers 
estimate that, without any sort of 
maintenance, it will last at least 
1,000 more years, standing vir- 
tually forever as a tribute to the 
immortal genius of 

MR. HAMILTON MOFFATT 

“Do tell,” murmured the at- 
torney. The director glumly start- 
ed to lead them through the 
bubble house. 

“Hell with it,” said Mundin. 
“Let’s go back to your place.” 

In Dr. Proctor’s private office, 
Mundin looked at the small, 
dusty bottle the director exhum- 
ed from an umbrella rack. He 
shuddered and said decisively, 
“No, nothing to drink, thanks. 
Dr. Proctor, I think I can de- 
finitely state that my client 
would be interested in donating 
twenty thousand dollars as a fund 
to be divided at your discretion 
between the Hall of Basics and 



the Coelenterata collection.” 
“Dear me!” Dr. Proctor lean- 
ed back in his chair, fondling the 
bottle, his face wreathed in 
smiles. “Dear me! Are you sure 
you wouldn’t care to— -just a 
very small — no? Do you know, 
perhaps I will, just to celebrate. 
A very wise decision, sir! It is, 
believe me, most unusual to find 
a layman who, like yourself, can 
at once perceive the ecological 
significance and thrilling morpho- 
logy of the humble coelenterate!” 
He tipped the bottle into a dusty 
water tumbler and raised it in a 
toast. “The Coelenterata!” he 
cried. 

M UNDIN was fumbling in his 
briefcase. He produced a 
check, already made out, a typ- 
ed document in duplicate, and a 
flat can that gurgled. 

“Now,” he said matter-of- 
factly, “pay close attention. Doc- 
tor. You, personally, are to di- 
lute the contents of this can with 
one quart of ordinary tap water, 
fill an ordinary garden sprayer 
with the solution, and spray the 
G-M-L Home in the Hall of 
Basics with it, covering all plas- 
tic parts from the outside. It 
shouldn’t take more than ten 
minutes, if you have a good 
sprayer. Naturally, you will make 
sure nobody sees you doing it. 
That should be easy enough, in 
your position, but make abso- 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lutely sure of it. And that will 
be that.” 

Dr. Proctor, eyes bulging, 
coughed an ounce of tinted grain 
neutral spirits over his desk. 
Choking and wheezing, he at last 
got out, “My dear sir! What on 
earth are you talking about? 
What is in that container? Why 
should I do any such preposter- 
ous thing?” 

“I’ll take your questions in 
order. I am talking about twenty 
thousand dollars. What is in that 
container is something worth 
twenty thousand dollars. You 
should do it because of twenty 
thousand dollars.” 

Dr. Proctor wiped his mouth 
with the back of his hand, almost 
speechless. “But — but if you as- 
sured me that the fluid would be 
entirely harmless — ” 

“I’ll do no such thing. Where 
I come from, you can get away 
with quite a lot for twenty thous- 
and dollars.” Mundin smiled fros- 
tily. “Come now. Doctor. Think 
of twenty thousand dollars! 
Think of the ecological signifi- 
cance and the thrilling morphol- 
ogy. And then sign this receipt — 
and then take the check.” 

Dr. Proctor looked at the 
check. “It’s post-dated a month,” 
he said tremulously. 

Mundin shrugged and began 
to repack his briefcase. “Well, if 
you’re going to quibble — ” 

Dr. Proctor snatched the check. 



He scribbled his name on the re- 
ceipt and, with a quick, furtive 
movement, dropped the flat can 
of fluid into his desk. 

In the return ’copter, Mundin 
and Bligh looked at each other. 
“He’ll do it,” Norvie Bligh said 
gravely. 

“He will. And that means we’ve 
got to have the serial numbers 
from the G-M-L files fast. You’d 
better see your friend Arnie 
Dworcas tonight.” 

Bligh choked down a protest. 
This part was his job. 

A RNIE Dworcas let him in, 
for he was old Norvell, the 
true friend, the shy acolyte. Sit- 
ting there with Arnie, listening to 
Arnie’s explanations of world af- 
fairs, it seemed to Norvie that 
Belly Rave was a nightmare and 
Mundin a figure from a dream. 
Nothing had changed, nothing 
would ever change, as long as he 
could sit and drink Amie’s beer. 
But there were changes . 
Arnie drained his glass of beer, 
wiped his mouth and dialed an- 
other. 

“No, Norvell,” he said medi- 
tatively, “I wouldn’t say that 
you have succeeded. Not as we 
Engineers understand success. To 
us Engineers, a mechanism — and 
all of us are mechanisms, I, you, 
everybody — a mechanism is a 
success when it is functioning at 
maximum efficiency. Frankly, in 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



117 



my little experiment of suggest- 
ing that you try Belly Rave, I 
was attempting to perform what 
we call ‘destructive testing’ — the 
only way in which maximum ef- 
ficiency can be determined. But 
what happened? By pure fortuit- 
ousness, you made a connection 
and are now a really able man’s 
secretary.” He sipped his beer 
sorrowfully. “To use an analogy, 
it’s as if my slipstick were to take 
credit for the computations I 
make on it.” 

“I’m sorry, Arnie,” Norvell 
said. It was very difficult to de- 
cide whether he wanted to laugh 
in Arnie’s face or take out some 
of those front teeth with a beer 
glass. “Mr. Mundin thinks a great 
deal of you and your brother, 
too, you know. You impressed 
him very much when you met 
him.” 

“Naturally. That’s one of the 
things you’ll have to learn. Like 
seeks like, in human relations as 
well as electrostatics.” 

“I thought in electrostatics like 
repelled — ” 

“There you go!” yelled Arnie 
violently. “The dogmatic, argu- 
mentative layman! It’s people 
like you that — ” 

“I’m sorry, Arnie!” 

“All right. Don’t get so excit- 
ed. Really able people never lose 
control of themselves, Norvell! 
That was a stupid thing for you 
to get all upset about.” 



“I’m sorry, Arnie. That’s what 
I was telling Mr. Mundin." 

Arnie, raising his glass irritat- 
edly, stopped it in mid-air. He 
peered suspiciously at Norvie 
over the rim. “What were you 
telling Mr. Mundin?” 

“Why, that you never lost con- 
trol in an emergency. That you 
would be a damned good man to 
put in charge of — oh! I shouldn’t 
have said anything!” Norvell 
covered his mouth with both 
hands. 

Arnie Dworcas said sternly, 
“Norvell, stop stammering and 
come out with it! In charge of 
what?" 

N ORVIE, who had been fight- 
ing back a tendency to retch, 
removed his hands from his 
mouth. “Well — well, it isn’t as if 
I couldn’t trust you, Arnie. It’s 
G-M-L.” 

“What about G-M-L?” 

Norvie said rapidly, “It’s too 
soon to say anything definite 
and, please, Arnie, don’t let a 
word of it get out. But you’ve 
heard the rumors about G-M-L, 
naturally.” 

“Naturally!” Arnie said, 
though he frowned blankly. 

“Mr. Mundin is associated 
with the — uh — the Coshocton 
bunch, Arnie. And he’s looking 
around— quietly, you know — for 
key men to replace some of the 
old duffers. And I took the lib- 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



erty of mentioning you to him, 
Amie. The only thing is, Mr. 
Mundin doesn’t know much 
about the technical end, you 
see, and he wasn’t sure just how 
much experience you’ve had.” 
“My record is in the profes- 
sional journals, Norvell. Not that 
I would feel free to discuss it in 
this informal manner in any case, 
of course.” 

‘‘Oh, of course! But what Mr. 
Mundin asked me was just what 
G-M-L Homes models you had 
worked on — serial numbers and 
locations and so on. And I had 
to tell him that all that informa- 
tion was locked up and you 
couldn’t possibly get your hands 
on it.” 

Arnie shook his head wonder- 
ingly. “Laymen,” he said. ''Nor- 
vell, there is no reason in the 
world why I can’t get micro-films 
of all that information. It’s 
only corporate fiddle-faddle that 
causes all the secrecy. We Engi- 
neers are accustomed to cutting 
through the red tape.” 

Norvell looked worshipful. 
“You mean you can?” 

“I have already said so, have- 
n’t I? It’s just a matter of going 
through the records and picking 
out the units I’ve worked on my- 
self, then making microfilms — ” 
“Better microfilm everything, 
Arnie,” Norvell suggested. “It’ll 
help Mr. Mundin understand the 
Broad Picture.” 



Arnie shrugged .humorously. 
“Why not?” 

“Don’t forget the serial num- 
bers,” Norvell added. 

“Laymen,” snorted Arnie 
Dworcas. 

XIX 

Q UITE by chance, the Big 
Seven were gathered in 
Ryan’s office on the day it hap- 
pened at the Museum of the Na- 
tional Association of the Build- 
ers of the American Dream. 

It was an ill-planned meeting, 
having more than one purpose. 
At the top level, it was a pep 
session and information seminar. 
On a lower level, three teams of 
auditors, one each for Hubble, 
Coett and Nelson, were going 
over the books of Ryan & Mun- 
din. Don Lavin was amiably 
present and Norma had started 
things off right when Hubble ab- 
sent-mindedly attempted to 
guide her to a seat. 

She snapped, “I do not impose 
on the biological fact that I am 
a woman and I don’t expect 
anybody to impose on me. If Mr. 
Hubble can’t keep his hands to 
himself, I expect him at least to 
leave me alone during working 
hours. After hours, I can manage 
to avoid him.” 

Bliss Hubble said with a 
straight face, “Sorry, Lavin. It 
won’t happen again.” To the 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



129 



rest, he said cheerfully, “Who’d 
like to take charge?” 

It was Coett, of course. He 
benignly told Mundin, ‘‘We’ll 
just ignore the audit boys out- 
side, shall we? I’m sure their 
work will be purely routine. Now, 
among ourselves, how are we do- 
ing? I, for one, haven’t been able 
to pick up as much floating 
G-M-L stock as I’d wish, nor 
have the prices been right so far.” 
“Same here,” said Hubble. 
"Ah — I agree,” Nelson said. 
Old man Ryan raised his hand. 
“Up to now, it’s been rumors, 
gentlemen. Very shortly, things 
will begin to happen. I think 
you’ll find some dumping of 
G-M-L will begin within, say, 
a week. And with proper man- 
agement and some luck, there 
will be as pretty a panic as you 
could wish within a month there- 
after. There won’t be time for a 
rally. Our group, gentlemen, will 
make the next meeting with a 
clear majority.” 

Hubble said abruptly, “I can’t 
get through to Green, Charles- 
worth.” It was a challenge, flung 
at Coett. “The comptroller of 
my publishing outfit thought it 
would be a good idea to renew a 
mortgage they hold on the trans- 
mitter tower in Sullivan County. 
They said no, so he paid them 
off in cash from our contingency 
fund. I thought I’d better check; 
it looked like a new policy. But 

130 



I can’t get through. When they 
want to be remote — you know.” 
“I find that very interesting, 
Bliss,” Nelson said. “Ah — I, too, 
have had occasion to make a rou- 
tine inquiry regarding insurance 
policies. That was six weeks ago 
and as yet I’ve had no reply. 
Green, Charlesworth sometimes 
appears to be dilatory, of course 
— a natural reflection of their 
deeply rooted conservatism.” 
“They’re progressives,” Hub- 
ble said scornfully. 

“Middle-of-the-roaders,” insis- 
ted Coett. 

Hubble asked Coett directly, 
“Having any trouble, Harry? 
We’ve bared our bosoms.” 
“Nothing you could call 
trouble,” Coett said. “Just that 
I’m not — getting through. Like 
you gentlemen. Oh, I’m doing 
business with them, but no real 
communication.” 

M UNDIN was inescapably re- 
minded of Captain Kowalik, 
unnerved and jittery because 
Commissioner Sabbatino didn’t 
talk to him any more. He asked 
bluntly, “Is this a bad situation?” 
They smiled politely and told 
him not to worry; it wasn’t his 
problem. Green, Charlesworth did 
nothing on the operating or man- 
ufacturing end. They were fi- 
nance. 

Hubble said, "Frankly, I don’t 
know where they stand on this 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thing. It was my opinion that 
they wouldn’t give a damn one 
way or the other. Nelson agreed 
with me and Harry thought 
they’d be all for us — not that they 
vote any G-M-L stock, but 
with their moral influence. Still, 
they’re a funny outfit, so this 
lapse may not mean anything.” 
Mundin asked, “Want me to 
go calling on them? Level with 
them? Have it out? Meet what- 
ever terms they may have?” 
Four heads swiveled and four 
incredulous stares drilled him. 
Coett spoke for all when he said 
gently, “No.” 

“My guess is that they’re onto 
us.” Hubble elaborated, “that 
they know every move we make 
and just haven’t committed 
themselves — yet.” 

Mundin looked at the three 
Titans in turn and asked won- 
deringly, “When you say ‘they,’ 
whom do you mean, exactly?” 

A three-cornered wrangle de- 
veloped while old man Ryan doz- 
ed off. Coett believed that Green, 
Charlesworth were essentially 
the top men in the Memphis 
crowd plus Organic Solvents and 
New England utilities. He him- 
self was most of the Southwest 
crowd and practically all of In- 
organic Chemicals. 

Nelson, who was New England 
and Non-Ferrous Metals, believ- 
ed that Green, Charlesworth were 
essentially California, coal-oil- 



steel and mass media. 

Hubble, who was mass media 
and New York, said that could- 
n’t be. Unless — with a hard look 
at Coett and Nelson — somebody 
was lying like hell. Green, 
Charlesworth, he thought, were 
essentially money. 

On that, everybody agreed. 
Worriedly. 

“Look,” said Mundin, “I just 
want to get this straight in my 
mind. Would we scuttle the whole 
project if Green, Charlesworth 
came out against it?” 

When somebody tells you, 
“Say, I’ve heard a rumor that 
two and two make four; do you 
put any stock in that stuff?” — 
that’s the kind of look Mundin 
got. 

Coett said quietly. “Why, yes, 
Charles. We would.” 

Hubble’s nervous voice cut in, 
“I don’t believe that’s going to 
happen, Charles. It’s simply a 
matter of getting in touch with 
them. After all, we’re taking a 
step forward and Green, Charles- 
worth have always been on the 
side of progress.” 

“Conservatism,” said Nelson. 

“Middle-of-the-roaders,” Coett 
insisted. 

That, clearly, was getting them 
nowhere. 

A NNOYED, Mundin demand- 
ed, “But who are they? 
Where are they?” 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



131 



Hubble said, “Their offices are 
in the Empire State Building — 
the entire building.” 

Mundin’s eyebrows climbed. 
“Jn New York?- I thought the 
place was condemned. And are 
there a real Green and a real 
Charlesworth?” 

Hubble shook his head. 
They’re there, all right. As for 
a real Mr. Green and a real Mr. 
Charlesworth — the firm name is 
a couple of hundred years old, 
so I’m not sure. When you go 
there, you never see anyone im- 
portant. Clerks, junior execu- 
tives, department heads. You do 
business with them and there are 
long waits — weeks, sometimes — 
while they’re ‘deciding policy 
questions.’ I suppose that means 
while they're getting their in- 
structions. Well, now you know 
as much about Green, Charles- 
worth as anybody* else. Just 
remember, if they turn up any- 
where, or you encounter any- 
thing — well, anomalous that 
makes you suspect they’re turn- 
ing up, blow the whistle. We’ll 
handle it.” 

“But there won’t be any 
trouble,” Coett said hopefully, 
and Nelson nervously agreed. 

Norvell Bligh popped in. “It 
happened!” he yelped, and dived 
for the television screen. “We 
had a guy monitoring and it 
just — ” 

“At first blamed on vibration,” 



roared a newscaster before Nor- 
vie got the sound where he want- 
ed it. “Experts from G-M-L, 
however, said that at first glance 
this appears unlikely. A team of 
G-M-L engineers is being dis- 
patched to Washington to study 
the wreckage. We bring you now 
a picture from our library of the 
first bubble house. As it was — ” 
The slide flashed on; there 
stood G-M-L Unit One, dwarfed 
by the Hall of Basics. 

“ — and as it is.” 

A live shot this time: Same 
site, same hall — but instead of 
the gleaming bubble house, a 
tangle of rubbish, with antlike 
uniformed men crawling about 
the wreckage. 

N ORMA Lavin blubbered, 
“Daddy’s first house!” and 
burst into tears. The others gave 
her swift, incredulous looks and 
went right back to staring in 
fascination and fear at the 
screen. 

“Our Washington editor now 
brings you Dr. Henry Proctor, 
Director of the Museum. Dr. 
Proctor?” The rabbit face flash- 
ed on, squirming, scared. 

“Dr. Proctor,” asked the mel- 
low tones, “what, in your opinion, 
might be the cause of the col- 
lapse?” 

“I really — I really have no 
opinion. I’m — uh — completely in 
the — uh — dark. It’s a puzzle to 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



me. I’m afraid I can’t — uh — be of 
the slightest — I have no opinion. 
Really.” 

“Thank you. Dr. Proctor!” 

To Mundin, rapt on the screen, 
it seemed that all was lost; any 
fool could read guilt, guilt, guilt 
plastered on the director’s quiver- 
ing face and at once infer that 
Proctor had sprayed the bubble 
house with a solvent supplied by 
someone else; and it would be 
only moments until “someone 
else” was identified as Charles 
Mundin. But the newscaster was 
babbling on. The rabbit face flick- 
ered off the screen. 

The newscaster said : “Ah, I 
have a statement just handed to 
me from G-M-L Homes. Mr. 
Haskell Arnold, Chairman of the 
Board of G-M-L Homes, an- 
nounced today that the engineer- 
ing staff of the firm has reached 
tentative conclusions regarding 
the partial malfunction — ” 

Even the newscaster stumbled 
over that. The listening men, re- 
calling the pile of rubble, roared 
and slapped their knees in a 
burst of released tension. 

“The — uh — partial malfunc- 
tion of G-M-L Unit One. They 
state that highly abnormal con- 
ditions of vibration and chemical 
environment present in the Mu- 
seum are obviously to blame. Mr. 
Arnold said, and I quote, ‘There 
is no possibility whatsoever that 
this will happen again.’ End of 



quote.” The announcer smiled 
and discarded a sheet from the 
papers in his hand. Now chummy, 
he went on; “Well, ladies and 
gentlemen, I’m certainly glad to 
hear that and so, I’m sure, are 
all of you who also live in bubble 
houses. 

“And now, for you sports fans, 
the morning line on Grosse 
Point Field Day. It’s going to 
be a bang-up show produced by 
the veteran impresario Jim ‘Blood 
and Guts’ Hanrahan. Plenty of 
solid, traditional entertainment. 
First spectacle — ” 

“Turn that thing off,” some- 
one ordered Norvell. Wistfully, 
he did — straining to catch the 
last words — remembering. 

Harry Coett broke the silence 
brutally. “Well, that’s that. 
We’re committed. Is everybody 
here as terrified as I am?” 

T HAT night, a ’copter droned 
west from New York, Norvie 
at the stick and Mundin glumly 
toying with a lever that would 
push a bowden wire that would 
open the cock of a pressurized 
belly tank full of golden fluid. 

Norvie asked, “Did I tell you 
it’s a boy? Looked through the 
fetuscope myself. The doctor 
said it’s the finest forty-day em- 
bryo he’s seen in twenty years of 
practice. I tell you, that kid’s 
going to have every advantage 
I never — ” 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



133 



“Swell, Norvie,” Mundin said 
with a snap in his voice. 

Norvie shut up. 

Mundin turned on a small 
pocket reader and slipped micro- 
film into i£. Old records copied 
on the sneak by Norvie’s friend 
Amie Dworcas, brought to him 
proudly and furtively. Much 
guff about “We Engineers, Mr. 
Mundin” and “You won’t for- 
get this, I hope, Mr. Mundin. As 
We Engineers say, you brace my 
buttress and I’ll brace yours, 
hah-hah-hah!” 

So the records said G-M-L 
No. 2 was the northwest corner 
of the Coshocton Bubble City; 
proceed along the western side of 
the polygon, then south . 

And where the golden drops 
rained down, Bubble House No. 
2, then No. 3, then No. 4 through 
No. 280 would one by one crum- 
ble, leaving families naked to 
the foundry fumes and weather. 
And throughout the country, 
hysteria would be unleashed. 
G-M-L lessees would frantically 
hunt for the serial plate of their 
houses, scribble calculations, 
wildly phone their friends. Thete 
would be a terrific run on sport- 
ing goods stores; the morning 
after the night Coshocton began 
to crumble, not a sleeping bag or 
tent would be left on their 
shelves. 

But that was all right. Hubble, 
Coett and Nelson had quietly 



bought control of the leading 
sporting goods companies. The 
rise in their stocks would con- 
stitute a nice little by-product. 

Charles Mundin, attorney, 
checked the tanks for the dozenth 
time and Norvell Bligh looked 
rigidly at the instruments that 
were set on Coshocton. 

XX 

T HE panic was as pretty as 
could be desired. Probably 
not one man-hour of work was 
done for days by anybody who 
occupied a bubble house. Hubble, 
Coett and Nelson flooded the 
New York Parimutuel Stock Ex- 
change with agents. A satisfac- 
tory trickle of dumped G-M-L 
stock began to run into their port- 
folios, against bidding by scat- 
tered, unready, disorganized 
agents for the Arnold group that 
controlled the G-M-L Board. 

Clearly, it was time for an- 
other session on the neutral 
ground of Ryan & Mundin, At- 
torneys at Law. 

“Progress, gentlemen,” Coett 
said happily after they had pool- 
ed information. “We are within 
sight of fifty-one per cent own- 
ership!” 

Norma demanded, “Is there 
going to be any more wrecking?” 
Nelson sniffed. “If the Arnold 
group firms up within, say, two 
days, they’ll be able to hold 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



against us. In that case, we’ll 
have to hit them with something 
new.” 

“No wrecking,” Norma said 
hoarsely. 

“You will kindly leave such 
decisions to us. If we must wreck, 
we will.” 

“And so will I!” She picked a 
vase from Ryan’s desk and threw 
it at Nelson. Her aim was true, 
but he ducked fast. 

The vase exploded with an 
electric snarl of blue light that 
charred the’ wall. Norma’s look of 
utter stupefaction matched any 
in the room. The silence lasted 
almost half a minute. 

“Call somebody in,” Coett 
said at last, his eyes not leaving 
the shards on the floor that still 
smoked. 

Mundin phoned, his voice 
shaky, for the firm’s top chem- 
ist. 

“Not my baby,” the chemist 
said after peering at the' frag- 
ments. “Get Joe Panelli, Mr. 
Mundin. It seems to be electrical, 
whatever it is.” 

Panelli, communications engi- 
neer, pronounced the intact vase 
to have been a wonderfully clever 
communicator — whether one-way 
or two-way, he could not say 
yet. The crackle in its glaze had 
been metallic — the vase was 
small, but the crackle was fine — 
perhaps a hundred meters of 
antenna. There were relics of 

GLADIATOR AT LAW 



transistors, fused little lumps 
buried in the clay. The four 
medallions and the band about 
the shoulder of the vase might 
contain Chinese characters or 
might not. To him, the charac- 
ters looked like unfamiliar print- 
ed circuits. The bell mouth of the 
jar suggested a non-directional 
mike and, yes, it could be a loud- 
speaker, too. 

■jV! - UNDIN asked urgently, 
1TJ. “Can you find out if there 
are any more of these things 
around?” 

“Oh, sure, Mr. Mundin,” said 
Panelli. “They put out a signal, 
so we just scan the bands.” 
“Can you do that without who- 
ever is listening in knowing about 
it?” Coett insisted. 

“Maybe yes, maybe no. My 
guess is no. Whoever designed 
this could — maybe would — de- 
sign the receiving equipment to 
indicate a drop in energy receiv- 
ed when we put a tap on.” 
“Then don’t do it,” Coett said. 
Panelli gave him a rebellious 
look. 

Mundin said, “Just hold every- 
thing, Joe. I’ll let you know.” 
There was another long si- 
lence. Hubble broke it with, 
“Scratch seven hundred and fifty 
thousand dollars, gentlemen.” 
“It’s an idea,” Coett said. He 
took out his fountain pen, look- 
ed wonderingly at it and put it 

135 



back in his pocket. He sighed. 

Old man Ryan put his face in 
his hands and groaned. Mundin 
had a fair idea of what was going 
through his mind. Back to Belly 
Rave and despair. And three days 
from the top. 

Mundin said loudly, “Speak- 
ing for my clients, the Lavins, I 
don’t see how I can conscienti- 
ously let you people back out of 
the agreement. Nor do I see any 
reason why you should. Some- 
body planted a microphone on 
us — so what? It happens every 
day.” 

“Quite a mike,” Hubble com- 
mented. He alone of the three 
money men seemed to be un- 
scared. Mundin decided to con- 
centrate on him. 

“Why the panic, Bliss? What’s 
wrong with these two?” 

“If you think I’m going to say 
one more word in your offices, 
Charles, you’re crazy. There may 
be more of those things around. 
Until this is wrapped up, I think 
it would be wisest to meet in turk- 
ish baths. I don’t see how Lavin 
could get in on such a confer- 
ence, but perhaps that’s best. 
The fewer who know, the safer 
the secret.” 

Mundin exploded, “Damn it, 
this is crazy! So there’s some- 
body spying on us. What of it? 
They’re just people. They’ve got 
nothing but money. We’re peo- 
ple, too, and we’ve also got 

136 



money — plenty of it. All right, 
maybe they have more, but that 
doesn’t make them God al- 
mighty. We can lick them if we 
have to!” 

He stopped. Hubble, Coett and 
Nelson were wincing at every 
word. 

Coett said faintly, “Don’t talk 
any more, Charles. You’ve said 
too much. Some interests — well, 
some people would call them re- 
lentless. Not that I’m agreeing 
for a minute.” His eyes were dart- 
ing around the room. 

N ORMA Lavin, pale and quiv- 
ering, stood up. “My father 
invented the bubble house for — ” 
She began tremblingly, then 
caught herself. “No! Leaving 
Daddy out of this, one-quarter 
of G-M-L Homes belongs to Don 
and myself. It’s ours, under- 
stand? Ours! Not yours or who- 
ever’s scaring the wits out of you. 
It isn’t just money, you know. 
We got along fine without any. 
We can do it again. It’s people. 
It’s making life worth living for 
the poor slobs who buy their 
bubble houses with their life’s 
blood! Slavery’s against the law. 
G-M-L’s been breaking the law 
— but we are taking over — and 
we are going to stop slavery. 
You hear me?” 

They heard her — and seven 
people were shouting at once, 
even old Ryan. “ — no better than 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a Democrat, young lady!” Nel- 
son was howling. And “For God’s 
sake, let her talk!” screamed 
Mundin. And Coett was spout- 
ing endless shushes, with gestures 
patting the air. 

And the door opened. Mishal, 
the Ay-rab boy, stared in, ter- 
ror on his face. 

“Visitor,” he told them, and 
disappeared. 

“Oh, hell,” Mundin said in the 
sudden silence, starting toward 
the door. “I told those idiots — 
oh, it’s you.” He looked irri- 
tatedly at the figure of William 
Choate IV, now entering. “Hel- 
lo, Willie. Look, I’m awfully 
busy right now — ” 

Willie Choate’s lower lip was 
trembling. “Hello, old man,” he 
said dismally. “I have a — mes- 
sage for you.” 

“Later, Willie, please.” 

Willie stood his ground. 
“Now.” 

He handed Mundin a square 
white envelope. Mundin, torn 
between annoyance and hysteria, 
opened it and glanced absently at 
the little white card inside. 

Then he glanced at it again. 

Then he stared at it until 
Coett came to life and leaped for- 
ward to take it out of his hand. 
It said in crabbed handwriting: 

Green, Charlesworth request the 
appearance of Mr. Charles Mun- 
din and Miss Norma Lavin when 
convenient. 



TT was a long ride. Willie 
Choate apologetically took 
out a magazine as soon as they 
settled down in the car. “You 
know what Great-great-grand- 
daddy Rufus said, Charles — 
‘Happy is he who has laid up in 
his youth, and held fast in all 
fortune, a genuine and passionate 
love for reading.’ I always like 
to—” 

“Sure, Willie,” said Mundin 
absently. “Look, what’s all this?” 

“Of course, he wasn’t my real 
Great-great-granddaddy. Grand - 
pap just kind of took that name 
when he bought into the firm. It’s 
just a way of — ” 

“Willie, please. Remember how 
it was in law school, the way I 
helped you pass the exams and 
all?” 

Willie seemed about to cry. 
“Charles, what can I say?” 

“You can tell me what this is 
all about!” 

Willie looked at Mundin. Then 
he looked all around him, at 
glowering Norma, at the fittings 
of the car. Then he looked at 
Mundin again. The implication 
was unmistakable. 

“At least tell me what your 
connection is,” Mundin begged. 

“Gee, Charles!” But the an- 
swer to that one, at least, was 
plain, written in those soft cow 
eyes, spelled out in that trem- 
bling lip. Willie was what God 
had made him to be — an errand 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



137 



boy — and doubtless knew little 
more than Mundin about what, 
why or wherefore. 

Mundin gave up and let Willie 
read his magazine, while he star- 
ed morosely at the crumbled city 
they were driving through. Nor- 
ma’s hand, startlingly, sought his 
for a moment, then jerked away. 

The building smelled old. 
They stepped into a creaking 
elevator and slowly went up fifty 
flights. A long walk and then 
another elevator, even smaller, 
even creakier. 

Then a small room with a 
hard bench. Willie left them 
there; all he said was, “See you.” 

Then — waiting. An hour, sev- 
eral hours. Norma talked about 
her childhood, her dedicated 
father, his miserable fate, her bit- 
ter disappointment that Don 
would not grow up to the re- 
sponsibility of being that great 
thing, a Lavin. It was scared, 
compulsive babbling. Something 
in the air militated against logic 
and sense. Crawly fingers — 

At last she fell silent, her eyes 
jerking about the room. 

Mundin thought he was going 
to crack apart and start yelling. 

Then he realized that that was 
what Green, Charlesworth want- 
ed him to think, and got a grip 
on himself. 

And, by arid by, a small, quiet 
man came and led them into an- 
other room. 



There was no place to sit and 
no place to hang their coats. 
Mundin draped his over his arm 
and stood staring back into the 
unblinking eyes of the man seat- 
ed at the desk. He was an impos- 
ing figure of a man, lean-fea- 
tured, dark-haired, temples shot 
with silver. He leaned forward, 
comfortably appraising. His chin 
was in one cupped hand, the 
fingers covering his lips, his eyes 
following Mundin. His chest 
rhythmically rose and fell; 
otherwise, he was stock still. 

Mundin cleared his throat. 
“Mr. — ah — Green?” 

T HE man said emotionlessly, 
“We despise you, Mr. Mun- 
din and Miss Lavin. We are go- 
ing to destroy you.” 

Mundin cried, “Why?” 

“You are Rocking the Boat,” 
the man said through his fingers, 
the piercing eyes locked with 
Mundin’s own. 

Mundin cleared his throat. 
“Look, Mr. Green — you are Mr. 
Green?” 

“You are Our Enemy, Mun- 
din.” 

“Now wait a minute!” Mun- 
din took a deep breath. Please! 
he silently begged his adrenal 
gland. Gently! he ordered the 
pounding sensation in his skull. 
He said temperately, “I’m sure 
we can get together, Mr. — sir. 
After all, we’re not greedy.” 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The figure said steadily, “Peo- 
ple like you would doom Civili- 
zation As We Know It if we let 
them. We do not intend to.” 

Mundin swept his eyes hope- 
lessly around the room. This man 
was obviously mad; someone 
else, anyone else — But there was 
no one. Barring the desk and 
the man, there was nothing in 
the room but a pair of milky 
glass cabinets and Mundin and 
Norma. 

He said, “Look, did you call 
us down here just to insult us?” 

“You two put your Fingers 
in the Buzz Saw. They will be 
Lopped Off.” 

“Insane,” Norma muttered 
faintly. 

“Dammit!” Mundin yelled. He 
hurled his coat violently to the 
floor, but it did nothing to calm 
him. “If you’re crazy, say so 
and let me get out of here! I 
never came across such blithering 
idiocy in my life!” 

He stopped in the middle of 
a beginning tirade; stopped short. 

The man wasn’t looking at him 
any more. The same unblinking 
and unwavering gaze that had 
been on Mundin was now pierc- 
ingly directed at the coat on the 
floor. 

To the coat, the motionless 
man said, “We brought you two 
here to see Infamy with Our 
Own Eyes. Now we have seen it 
and we will Blot It Out.” And 



then startlingly, shrilly, “Hee!” 

Mundin swallowed and step- 
ped gingerly forward. Three 
paces and he was at the desk, 
leaning over, looking at what 
should be the neatly tailored 
trousers of the man’s modest suit. 

The personnel of Green, 
Charlesworth were not wearing 
trousers this year. The personnel 
of Green, Charlesworth were 
wearing bronze pedestals with 
thick black cables snaking out 
of them, and brass nameplates 
that read: 

SLEEPLESS RECEPTIONIST 
115 Volt A. C. Only 

“Hee!” shrilled the motionless 
lips, just by Mundin’s ear. 
“That’s far enough, Mundin. You 
were right, I suppose, Mrs. 
Green.” 

M UNDIN leaped back as 
though the 115 volts of 
A. C. had passed through his ton- 
sils. A flicker of light caught his 
eye; the two milky glass cab- 
inets had lighted up. He looked, 
peripherally aware that Norma 
had toppled in a faint beside 
him. 

He wished he hadn’t looked. 
The contents of the cabinets 
were Green and Charlesworth. 
Green, an incredibly, impossibly 
ancient dumpy-looking, hairless 
female. Charlesworth, an incred-

139 




ible, impossibly ancient string- 
bean-looking, hairless male. 

Mercifully, the lights flickered 
out. 

Another voice said, but from 
the same motionless lips, “Can 
we kill them, Mr. Charlesworth?” 

“I think not, Mrs. Green,” the 
Sleepless ’Receptionist answered 
itself in the first voice. 

Mundin said forcefully, “Now 
wait a minute.” It was pure re- 
flex. He came to the end of the 
sentence and stopped. 

The female voice said sadly. 
“Perhaps they will commit sui- 
cide, Mr. Charlesworth. Tell him 
what he is Up Against.” 



140

“He knows what he is Up 
Against, Mrs. Green. Don’t you, 
Mundin?” 

Mundin nodded. He was ob- 
sessed by the Sleepless Recep- 
tionist’s eyes, now piercingly 
aimed at him again — attracted, 
perhaps, by the movement. 

“Tell him!” shrieked Mrs. 
Green. “Tell him about that boy. 
Tell him what we’ll do to him!” 

“A Child of Evil,” the male 
voice said mechanically. “He 



wants to take G-M-L away from 
us.” 

Mundin was galvanized. “Not 
you! Just Arnold ^nd his crowd!” 

“Are Our Fingers Us?” the fe- 
male voice demanded. “Are Our 
Arms and Legs Us? Arnold is 
Us!” 

The male voice piped, “The 
girl, Mrs. Green. The girl!" 

“Painted Courtesan,” observ- 
ed the female voice. “She wants 
to free the slaves, she says. She

talks about Mr. Lincoln! 

“But you know we fixed Mr. 
Lincoln’s Wagon, Mr. Charles- 
worth,” chortled the female voice. 

“We did, Mrs. Green. And we 
will Fix her Wagon, too.” 

Mundin, thinking dazedly that 
he should have been more care- 
ful where he put Ryan’s yen 
pox — it was stupid of him to get 
it mixed up with his vitamin 
pills — said feebly, “Are you that 
old?” 

“Are we that old, Mrs. Green?” 
asked the male voice. 

“Are we!” shrilled the female. 
“Tell him! Tell him about the 
boy!” 

“Perhaps not now, Mrs. Green. 
Perhaps later. When we have 
Softened them Up. You two may 
go now.” 

Mundin automatically put on 
his coat and lifted Norma to his 
shoulder. He turned dazedly to 
the door. Halfway, he stopped, 
staring at the milky glass. Glass, 
he thought. Glass and quivering, 
moving corpses inside that a 
breath of air might — 

“Try it, Mundin,” challenged 
the voice. “We wanted to see if 
you would.” 

Mundin decided against it. 

“Too bad,” said the voice of 
Charlesworth. “We hate you, 
Mundin. You said we were not 
God Almighty.” 

“Athiest!” hissed the voice of 
Mrs. Green. 



B ACK in Ryan’s office, Mun- 
din said, lying, “It wasn’t 
so bad.” 

Ryan had taken advantage of 
their absence to get coked to the 
eyebrows. He said dreamily, 
“Think of them, hundreds of 
years old. You know what H. G. 
Wells said? ‘A frightful queer- 
ness is coming into life.’ Nothing 
went right, no matter what you 
did. You know what Jonathan 
Swift called Green, Charles- 
worth? Struldbrugs. Those were 
the only people were on to them. 
Gulliver said they had a law that 
no Struldbrug could keep his 
money after he was a hundred. 
Think of them, hundreds of 
years old, hundreds and hun- 
dreds and hun — ” 

Don Lavin touched his shoul- 
der and he stopped. 

Harry Coett, smiling affably 
at his own thumbnail, said gent- 
ly, “How about a drink?” 

Mundin poured it for him, 
pretending not to notice that the 
big man was quite soaked with 
sweat there in the air-condition- 
ed room. 

“We must proceed to an or- 
derly liquidation,” Nelson said, 
his eyes jumping from one cor- 
ner to another. “Naturally, any 
further action along our pre- 
vious lines is out of the question.” 
Norma appeared at the door 



142 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



carrying a projector. Mundin had 
left her in her office under the 
care of the company nurse. 

“Is it all settled by now?” 
she asked grimly. 

“Everybody seems to be in 
agreement.” Mundin felt weigh- 
ed down by a tremendous apathy. 
Four men who aggregated eight 
times his age, thirty times his 
business experience — you could- 
n’t buck all that. 

Norma opened the projector 
and swept papers from Ryan’s 
desk. 

“I just wanted to show you,” 
she said. “These are the family’s 
home movies. It’s kept me going 
through some hard times . .” 
She dimmed the lights and turn- 
ed on the projector. 

“Here’s Father,” she said. “In 
the plant.” 

Somebody had sneaked up with 
a camera, catching Lavin un- 
aware. The “plant” looked very 
much like a cinder-block barn, 
with benches and presses. Three 
people working on a big bread- 
board electrical layout, backs to 
camera. 

Tired, authoritative voice: 
“You don’t seem to get the idea, 
Bernie. I don’t just want a door. 
The Egyptians had doors. I don’t 
just want a good door. Some 
doors have been pretty good in 
the past five thousand years. I 
want a perfect door. Hell, I guess 
my mistake is calling it a door. 



That creates a picture in your 
mind. Now let’s scrap all this 
junk of yours and think about 
entering-and-leaving devices." - 
An agonized protest: “Mr. La- 
vin, twenty-six months of work!” 

T AVIN lost his temper. 

“Twenty-six months of work, 
Gorman, versus five thousand 
years of drafts, squeaks, sticks, 
slams, irritation, muscle -strain, 
lost keys, burglary, scuffed 
thresholds, scarred panels, that 
damned ridiculous disproportion- 
ate strain on the upper hinge that 
guarantees malfunction, the stu- 
pidity of making doors too small 
for furniture and too large for 
people! Don’t come whining to 
me about your lousy twenty-six 
months of pooping around! 
Think about it, Gorman! Use 
your head for a change! We’re 
trying to bring some ease and 
graciousness into life for every- 
body! Let’s do something for 
people instead of whimpering 
about twenty-six months — ” 

The speaker turned, then grin- 
ned startledly at whoever the 
cameraman was, and waved. Gor- 
man looked sulky and defensive 
as the clip ran through. It was, 
Mundin uneasily realized, a fore- 
taste of his eventual suicide be- 
cause of frustration and defeat. 

Norma said, hushed, “A quick 
one of our living quarters.” It 
was a posed shot of Lavin and his 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



143 



wife. The background was some- 
thing that looked like a chicken 
coop, but was more likely a va- 
riety of pre-fab dwelling. Beav- 
erboard walls insecurely held to- 
gether by battens, a smoky oil 
heater, a grotesque chrome-and- 
formica dinette set ferociously 
trying to elbow the two Lavins 
out of the picture altogether. Mr. 
Lavin was smiling absently. His 
wife looked sour and darted un- 
certain looks at the smoking 
heater. Obviously she couldn’t 
wait to get at it. 

“The trade show,” Norma said. 
“The awards banquet.” 

It was the speakers table of 
any grand ballroom of any down- 
town hotel. The debris of squab 
with wild rice, cups of deathly 
black coffee and melting, multi- 
colored ice cream being removed 
by sullen banquet waiters. A 
toastmaster pinged on his water 
glass as he rose and cleared his 
throat into the mikes. 

“Members and guests,” he said 
fruitily, “of the Delivered Dwell- 
ing Industrial Association. It is 
altogether fitting and proper to- 
night that we have gathered to do 
honor to a new star in the con- 
stellation of Delivered Dwelling 
manufacturers. Surely, as we re- 
view the meteoric rise of Donald 
Lavin, there can be none here 
who doubts that he is a man who 
does credit to the industry, a 
competitor who fights hard and 



clean, a designer of striking orig- 
inality and a businessman whose 
acumen points the way toward 
an entirely new concept of De- 
livered Dwelling finance and un- 
derwriting. Members and guests, 
it gives me great pleasure to pre- 
sent to Mr. Donald Lavin of 
Coshocton, Ohio, this plaque des- 
ignating him the Delivered 
Dwelling Manufacturer of the 
Year!” 

A PPLAUSE; passing the 
plaque ; still photographers 
crowding in for shots. Lavin ris- 
ing. To his left, a man like an 
undernourished shoat — Gor- 
man. To his right, a gaunt man 
who looked like an exceptionally 
lean gray rat — Moffatt. 

Lavin fumbled the plaque for 
a moment and then uncertainly 
put it down. 

He said, “Thanks. Maybe I’m 
accepting this thing under false 
pretenses — I know the title of my 
speech is supposed to be ‘New 
Approaches to the Delivered 
Dwelling,’ but first I’d like to 
give some credit where credit’s 
due and to make a correction in 
the introductory remarks. To my 
left is sitting Mr. Bernard Gor- 
man, who deserves as much cred- 
it as I for the design of the Lavin 
House. I may be the dynamo 
some people have called me, but 
Bernie’s the detail man, the best 
I ever knew, and I’m not going to

let him get away without taking 
a bow.” 

Gorman rose and bobbed, 
flushing. 

“Reference was also made to 
me as a businessman. I decline 
the honor. The only businessman 
on our premises is our good 
treasurer and comptroller, Ham- 
ilton Moffatt, without whose 
common sense and fiscal know- 
how, my company would never 
have got off the ground.” 

The thin gray rat took a pre- 
cise little bow, unasked. 

“And I should say that Mr. 
Walsh’s introductory remarks 
about our novel policy of financ- 
ing and underwriting by indus- 
trial purchase and subsequent 
leasing are Mr. Moffatt’s idea 
and a darned good one, too, for 
a young company in need of 
working capital — but an idea that 
I hope we’ll be in a position to 
abandon shortly. 

“And now to" my main head- 
ing. There’s no need for me to be 
modest, is there? You all know 
the Lavin House is good or you 
wouldn’t have given me that 
plaque. How~&d-it get that way? 
Partly because technology is at 
last developed to the point where 
good housing is possible; partly 
because I realized long ago that 
human stupidity is nowhere so 
marked and so costly as in hous- 
ing. 

“I sat up one day in my bed- 



room. The floor was wooden. The 
walls were paint over paper, over 
plaster, over lath, over two-by- 
fours. The roof was gabled. The 
windows were steel-casement. 
The doors were hinged slabs. The 
stairs were stairs — and I can say 
nothing worse of them. The people 
in that house were hot in the sum- 
mer, cold in the winter, assailed 
by pollen and every passing 
street noise — oh, yes, the house 
was, of course, equipped with 
central air-conditioning. The 
place was filthy, requiring a bat- 
tery of cleaning machinery to be 
hauled about weekly or oftener.” 

T AVIN paused. “The house 
was a weird combination of 
the flexible and the rigid, which 
meant that there were cracks. It 
was a Tinker Toy structure — lots 
of little bits fastened to other 
little bits with little fastening de- 
vices, which meant that little bits 
were continually coming loose 
and falling off and having to be 
replaced. That house fought its 
occupants like a tiger — or I 
should say like a plague of ants. 
It nibbled away at its occu- 
pants’ leisure and serenity in- 
stead of supplying both in copi- 
ous quantities. 

“I sat up in my bedroom and 
decided this foolishness had gone 
on long enough. The next day, I 
drew my first sketches of a bet- 
ter house, and I continued draw-

ing for ten years. By then, I was 
ready to start on a pilot model, 
which took five years. After that, 
I was ready to start on the pro- 
duction problem, which we have 
only just licked — I say with my 
fingers crossed. 

“Am I wandering from the sub- 
ject, New Approaches to the De- 
livered Dwelling? I hope not. My 
new approach, gentlemen, was to 
think of the dweller in the dwell- 
ing and give him a house that 
helps him instead of fighting him. 
A house at a cost he can afford, 
without any disasters in the way 
of repairs. A house that gives 
him light to see by, privacy, safe- 
ty for his kids, leisure for his 
wife and him, variety to make 
homecoming a happy adventure 
instead of a revolting daily chore. 

“My New Approach to the 
Delivered Dwelling, gentlemen, 
was nothing more or less than a 
sincere attempt to leave the 
world a better and happier place 
for millions than it was when I 
found it.” 

The applause was sparse and 
dubious. 

Norma flicked the machine off, 
but did not brighten the lights. 
She said broodingly, “So Moffatt 
sold him out, broke his heart and 
killed him. And today that dream 
is a nightmare to millions of 
wretched people chained to 
their jobs by G-M-L contract 
leases . 



She turned on the three finan- 
ciers, figures in the gloom. 

“Well?” she demanded harsh- 
ly. “Don can walk into that 
stockholders meeting and take 
over with your backing. It mat- 
ters, don’t you see? It matters.” 

M UNDIN cleared his throat 
and said, “I’m sticking with 
it, Norma.” 

She didn’t flare at him for us- 
ing her first name, but continued 
to stare her challenge. 

Nelson murmured, “An order- 
ly liquidation, under the circum- 
stances, still seems most advis- 
able. If you will excuse me — ” 
He slipped discreetly from the 
room. 

Coett, big bluff man, told her, 
“Ideals don’t matter much when 
you’re my age. My advice to 
you is to peddle your stock on 
the Big Board, live happily ever 
after — and stay away from 

Green, Charlesworth. Uplift 
doesn’t pay. Now I’ve got to go.” 
He went. 

Hubble was gnawipg-his nails. 
He said, “I was brought up to 
be a sensible, dollar-fearing 
young man and Green, Charles- 
worth have more dollars than 
anybody else around ... You 
know, I liked that look on your 
father’s face when he told them 
about homecoming being a happy 
adventure . For God’s sake, 
don’t tell anybody, but I’m stick- 



146

ing with you as long as my nerve 
holds out.” 

Norma flung her arms around 
him and kissed him. Charles said. 
“Hey, cut that — ” and then real- 
ized he had no basis whatsoever 
for the proprietary feeling which 
had suddenly overwhelmed him. 
But he turned up the lights, any- 
way. 

“Where’s Don?” he asked. 

Norma was recovering from 
her elation. “Must’ve slipped 
out.” 

Mundin called Norvell Bligh 
in and asked after Don. 

“Oh, yes,” the little man said. 
“He left about three minutes 
ago.” 

“Left? Where to?” 

“Well, I asked him in case, and 
all he said was ‘High wire.’ Some 
kind of joke, I suppose.” 

“High wire?” Mundin asked 
Norma blankly. 

She shook her head. 

“He seemed in high spirits,” 
Bligh chatted. “His eyes were 
shining like stars. Most un- 
usual — ” 

“My God!” said Norma. “A 
post-hypnotic command from 
his conditioning!” 

“Does anybody,” Hubble de- 
manded, “know what a high wir,e 
may be? There could be some 
perfectly simple explanation.” 

Norvie’s jaw had dropped. He 
said at last, faintly, “I know quite 
a lot about high-wire work. It’s 



the most dangerous stunt they 
put on at a Field Day.” 

A raucous cackle filled the 
room. 

“ Absolutely , Mr. Charles- 
worth?” 

“Positively, Mrs. Green!” 
Hell broke loose. A seat cush- 
ion exploded. Then a fountain 
pen in Norvie’s pocket. The In 
basket on Ryan’s desk. There 
were screams from the outside 
offices; Mundin ran out. A dif- 
fraction grating in the chem lab. 
Steno’s lip-sprays. An acetate re- 
cording blank fox' a dictating 
machine. The water cooler — that 
was a sloppy one. A magazine 
in the reception room. 

Eventually things settled down. 
The last hysterical filing clerk 
was sent home, the last of the lit- 
tle fires put out. 

Hubble, white with rage, snap- 
ped, “Let’s go to my place. They 
can’t have that gimmicked.” 
Norvell Bligh said: “Excuse 
me, Mr. Hubble — I don’t think 
there’s time. Field Day is tomor- 
row at two in the afternoon.” 

XXII 

nPHEY searched throughout the 
night. Hard. They found the 
cabby at dawn. 

“Sure, mister, I hacked him. 
Right to the artist’s entrance at 
Monmouth. Friend of yours? 
Some kind of dare?”

They tried to bribe their way 
into the arena and almost made 
it. The .furtive gatekeeper was on 
the verge of swallowing their 
cock-and-bull story and palming 
their money when the Night 
Supervisory Custodian showed 
up. He was a giant and his eyes 
shone. 

He said politely, “I’m sorry, 
folks — unauthorized access is 
forbidden. However, lineup for 
bleacher seats begins in a couple 
of hours. Hello, Mr. Bligh. I 
haven’t seen you around lately.” 
“Hello, Barnes,” Norvell said. 
‘'Look, can you possibly let us 
through? There’s a fool kid we 
know who signed up on a dare. 
It’s all a silly mistake and he was 
muggled up, besides — ” 

The giant sighed regretfully. 
“Unauthorized access is forbid- 
den. If you had a pass — ” 

The hackie said, “I don’t mina 
waiting, folks, but don’t you have 
better sense than to argue with a 
conditioned guy?” 

“He’s right,” Norvell admitted. 
“Hell won’t get you by Barnes 
without a pass or a release. Let’s 
try Candella. He used to be my 
boss, the louse.” 

The taxi whizzed them to the 
amusement company’s bubble 
city and Candella’s pleasure 
dome. Ryan snoozed. Norma 
and Mundin hqld hands — scared. 
Bligh looked brightly interested, 
like a fox terrier. Hubble, hunch- 



ed on a jump seat, mumbled wor- 
riedly to himself. 

» Candella awakened and came 
to the interviewer after five min- 
utes of chiming. Obviously he 
couldn’t believe his eyes. 
“Bligh?” he sputtered. “Norvell 
Bligh?” 

“Yes, Mr. Candella. I’m sorry 
to wake you up, but it’s urgent. 
Can you let us in?” 

“Certainly not! Go away or 
I’ll call the police!” The inter- 
viewer blinked off. Norvell lean- 
ed on the chime plate and Can- 
della reappeared. “Damn it, 
Bligh, stop that. How dare you?” 

Mundin elbowed Norvell from 
the scanner eye. “Mr. Candella, 
I’m Charles Mundin, attorney at 
law. I represent Mr. Donald La- 
vin. I have reason to believe that 
Lavin took a release and is now 
in the artist’s quarters at Mon- 
mouth, due to appear in today’s 
Field Day. I advise you that my 
client is mentally incompetent to 
sign a release and that therefore 
your organization will be sub- 
ject to heavy damages, should 
he be harmed. I suggest that this 
can be quickly adjusted by you 
in filling out the necessary papers 
canceling your contract with him. 
Naturally, we’re prepared to pay 
any indemnity — or service fee.” 
He lowered his voice. “In small 
bills and plenty of them.” 

“Come in,” Candella said 
blandly and the door opened. 



GLADIATOR AT LAW

He gaped as they entered. “My 
God, an army!” 

|r T^HE house intercom said in a 
female voice, “What is it, 
Poopsie?” 

He flushed. “Business. Switch 
off, please. Panther Girl — I mean 
Prudence.” There was a giggle 
and a click. “Now, gentlemen and 
m iss — no, I don’t care what your 
names nre — let me show you one 
of our release forms. Here, you 
said you were a lawyer. Have a 
look.” 

MuncJin studied it for ten min- 
utes. Ironclad? Watertight? No, 
tungsten-carbide-coated, braced, 
buttressed, riveted, welded and 
fire-polished. Airtight, hard-va- 
cuum-proof, guaranteed not to 
wilt, shrink, sag, wrinkle, tear or 
bag at the clauses under any con- 
ceivable legal assault. 

Candella was enjoying Mun- 
din’s expression. “Think you’re 
the first?” he snickered. “If 
there’s been one, there have been 
a million. But there hasn’t been 
a successful suit for thirty years, 
Mr. Attorney.” 

MuncJin said, “Hang the law, 
Mr. Candella. Hang the bribe, 
too, if ^ou don’t want it. It’s a 
humanitarian matter. The kid’s 
got no business in there — ” 

Candella turned righteous. 
“I’m protecting my company and 
its stockholders, Mr. Whoever- 
you-are,, As a policy matter, we 



can allow no exceptions. Our 
Field Days would be a chaos if 
every drunken bum — ” 

Mundin was about to clobber 
him when Norvell unexpectedly 
caught his arm. “No use, Charles. 
I never realized it before — he’s a 
sadist. Of course. Who else could 
hold that job and enjoy it? 
You’re interfering with his love 
life when you try to get one of 
his victims away from him. We’ll 
go higher.” 

Candella snorted and showed 
them pointedly to the door. 

In the taxi again, Mundin said 
to Hubble, “I guess this is where 
you take over, Bliss.” 

The financier flipped through a 
notecase and reached for the 
phone as they rolled back toward 
the Park. He dialed and snap- 
ped, “Sam? Mr. Hubble here. 
Good morning to you. Sam, 
who’s in charge of the outfit 
that puts on the Monmouth Field 
Days? I’ll wait.” He waited and 
then said, “Oh — thanks, Sam,” 
and hung up the phone. He told 
them, looking out the window, 
“Trustee stock. Held by the 
Choate firm. And we know who 
they run errands for, don’t we?” 
He drummed his fingers. “Bligh, 
you must know some way in. 
You worked there, after all.” 
Norvell said, “The only way in 
is with a release.” , 

Norma urged with dry hys- 
teria, “Then let’s sign releases.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

They stared. “I’m not crazy. 
We want to find Don, don’t we? 
And when we find him, we re- 
strain him — with a club, if we 
have to. We can sign for crowd 
extras or something like that, 
can’t we, Norvie? It’s all volun- 
teer, isn’t it?” 

Norvell said, “Remember, I 
wasn’t a pit boss. I was on the 
planning end. And from the plan- 
ning end, it was all supposed to 
be volunteer. But maybe it’s not 
such a bad idea. I’ll go in alone. 
I know the ropes — ” 

“Not you,” Mundin said. “He 
won’t want to be found. He’ll 
fight. I’ll go—” 

They would all go. And then 
Norvell had a bright idea and it 
took a lot of small bills to get 
the hackie to take them to Belly 
Rave and an hour to find Lana 
of the Wabbits. 

“We’ll be there,” she promised 
casually. 

T HE briefing room beneath the 
stands was huge and crowd- 
ed. About a quarter of the occu- 
pants were obvious rumdums, 
another quarter were profession- 
als, another quarter swaggering 
youngsters in for a one-shot that 
they’d brag about the rest of their 
lives. The rest seemed to be — 
just people. It was twelve-thirty 
and everybody had been given 
an excellent hot lunch in the ad- 
joining cafeteria. 



One professional had noticed 
Mundin hungrily wolfing down 
his and suggested, “Better not, 
stranger. Belly wounds.” Mundin 
had abruptly stopped. 

There was no sign so far of Don 
Lavin, which was not odd. It was 
easy enough to lose yourself in 
that crowd. Their hopes were 
pinned on twenty Wabbits whom 
Lavin would have — he’d think — 
no reason to avoid. 

Somebody on the rostrum said, 
“May I have your attention, 
please? You stumblebums in the 
corner there — that means you, 
too. Thanks, all.” He was a dis- 
traught young man who ran his 
fingers through his hair. 

Norvie whispered to Mundin. 
“Wilkes. He’ll have a nervous 
breakdown by tonight. Every 
year. But — ” wistfully — “he’s a 
good MC.” 

Wilkes went on, “You know 
this is the show of the year, 
ladies and gentlemen. Double 
fees and survivor’s insurance for 
this one. And in return, ladies and 
gentlemen, we expect you all to 
do your absolute best for Mon- 
mouth Park. 

“Now let’s get on with the cast- 
ing. First, a comedy number. We 
need some old gentlemen and 
ladies — nothing violent; padded 
clubs in a battle-royal to the fin- 
ish. The last surviving lady gets 
five hundred dollars; the surviv- 
ing gentlemen gets one thousand. 



GLADIATOR AT LAW

Let’s see some hands there! No, 
not you, buster — you can’t be a 
day over seventy.” 

“Take it,” Bligh told Ryan. 
“Go with them and keep your 
eyes open for Don.’* 

Ryan got the nod and tottered 
away with the other old ladies 
and gentlemen. 

“Now are there two good men 
who fancy themselves as knife - 
fighters, Scandinavian style? 
Don’t waste my time if you have 
a pot-belly.” Scandinavian style 
meant being fastened together by 
a belt with two feet of slack. 
“One thousand? Anybody at one 
thousand? All right, I’ll make it 
twelve-fifty and if there isn’t a 
rising ovation, we drop the num- 
ber, you yellow crumbs!” Per- 
haps a dozen pros hopped up, 
grinning. “Fine response! Let’s 
make it six matches simulta- 
neous. Take ’em away, boys.” 
The casting went on. Mickey’s 
Inferno; Lions and Tigers and 
Bears; Kiddie Kutups, which 
scooped in all the Wabbits. Lana 
shot Mundin a glance and shrug. 
No Don Lavin — but the crowd 
was thinning. 

“Roller Derby!” Wilkes called. 
“Spiked elbows, no armor. Five 
hundred a point to contestants, 
twenty flat to audience, a hun- 
dred to audience members if a 
contestant lands on him or her 
and draws blood.” 

Norvell gathered the eyes of 



Mundin, Norma and Hubble. 
They rose, were accepted for 
“audience” and hustled out of the 
briefing room, still vainly peer- 
ing about for Don. Only after the 
glass door closed behind them did 
they see him. He was rising — 
with glazed, shining eyes — for 
High Wire with Piranha. Price, 
ten thousand dollars. And he was 
the only volunteer. 

Norma struggled with the im- 
movable door until two matrons 
yanked her away and shoved her 
in the direction of the ready 
room. 

“I’ll think of something,” Nor- 
vie kept saying. “I’ll think of 
something.” 

XXIII 

N ORVELL tried the chummy 
approach with the ready- 
room manager. He was brushed 
off. Norvell tried entreaties and 
then threats. He was brushed off. 
The ready-room manager dron- 
ed: “You made yer bed, now lie 
in it. Alluva sudden you an’ ya 
frenns get yella, no skin offa my 
nose. Derby audience ya stood up 
for, derby audience yer gonna 
be.” 

“What’s the trouble, Campo?” 
a fussy and familiar voice sud- 
denly demanded. 

It was Stimmens, Norvie’s 
skunk of an ex-assistant who had 
quietly and competently betray- 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ed his boss v into Belly Rave. It 
would have been pure delight 
to bawl him out, but the stakes 
were too high. 

“Mr. Stimmens,” Norvie said 
humbly. 

“Why, Mr. Bluh — why,' Nor- 
vie! What are you doing here?” 

Norvie brutishly wiped his 
nose on his sleeve. “Trying to 
make a buck, Mr. Stimmens,” he 
whined. “You know how it is in 
Belly Rave. I stood up for the 
Roller Derby audience, but Mr. 
Campo here says I got yellow. 
Maybe I did, but I want a switch 
— from Derby Audience to High- 
wire Heckler. I know it’s only 
ten bucks, but you don’t get one 
of those spiked-elbow gals in 
your lap. Can you do it for me, 
Mr. Stimmens? And a couple of 
friends of mine? Please?” 

Stimmens basked. “It’s un- 
usual, Norvie. It creates con- 
fusion. But for an old employee, 
we can bend some rules. See 
that he’s switched, Campo.” 

“And my friends, please, Mr. 
Stimmens?” 

Stimmens shrugged tolerantly. 
“And his friends, Campo.” He 
sauntered on, glowing with the 
consciousness of a favor done 
that humiliated his ex-boss and 
caused himself no trouble at all. 

“You heard him,” Norvell said. 
“Switch!” 

Campo growled and reached 
for his cards. 



Back on the bench, Norvell 
told Hubble, Mundin and Nor- 
ma briefly, “We’re in. It ups 
Don’s chances plenty. You have 
any cash on you, Mr. Hubble? 
Pass it around to the other High- 
wire Hecklers when we go on.” 
And then there was nothing to 
do but watch through the glass 
wall. The Old-timers’ Battle 
Royal was on; they saw Ryan 
laid out by a vicious swipe to the 
groin from an octogenarian lady. 
The clubs were padded, but there 
was a lot in knowing how to use 
them. He was carried past the 
wall, groaning, to the infirmary. 

I T was a responsive audience, 
Norvie noted with pure tech- 
nical interest, laughing, howling 
and throwing things at the right 
time. He heard, in memory, the 
familiar chant of the vendors, 
“Gitcha rocks, gitcha brickbats, 
ya ca-a-an’t hit the artists with- 
out a brickbat!” 

Click, click, and the Scandi- 
navian knife-fighters were on. 
Snip, snap, the knives flashed 
and the blood flowed. There were 
two double -kills out of the six 
pairs and the band blared from 
Grieg to Gershwin for the Roller 
Derby, which would last a good 
ten minutes. 

It was gory. Repeatedly, skat- 
ers shot off the banked boards 
into the “audience” of old stew- 
bums and thrill -seekers rather 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



153 



than get a razor-sharp elbow 
spike, and their own spikes 
wreaked havoc. Almost us, Nor- 
vie thought numbly. At a hun- 
dred a lapful, almost us. 

For the first time in his life, 
he found himself wondering when 
and where it all had started. 
Bone -crushing football? Those 
hockey games featured by con- 
cussions? Impatient sidewalk 
crowds that roared “Go-go-go” 
to a poor crazed ledge-sitter? 
Those fans who flipped lighted 
firecrackers at the visiting team’s 
outfielders racing for a fly? “We 
don’t take no prisoners in this 
outfit, kid”? White phosphorus 
grenades? Buchenwald? Napalm? 

And then, before he knew it, 
Campo' was shaking his shoulder 
and growling, “All right, ya yella 
punk. You an’ yer frenns, yer on. 
Take yer basket.” 

He took the basket numbly 
and looked at the noisemakers 
and gravel. He followed the sec- 
tion as it moved out onto the 
field. He became aware that Hub- 
ble and Mundin were half carry- 
ing him. 

“Don’t cork out, Norvie,” 
Mundin begged him. “We need 
every man.” 

Norvie gave him a pale grin 
and thought : Maybe I won’t 
have to. Maybe I won’t have to. 
That’s the thing to stick with. 
Maybe I won’t have to. But if I 
do — 



“Ladies and gentlemen,” the 
MC roared as they assumed their 
places around the tank, while 
the riggers hastily set up the two 
towers and strung the wire, 
“Monmouth Park is proud and 
happy to present, for the first 
time in this arena’s distinguished 
history, a novel feat of courage 
and dexterity.” 

Don had been hustled atop one 
of the towers. Norma was weep- 
ing. Hubble and Mundin were 
passing among the hecklers, 
handing out bills. 

“No heckling, understand? Just 
keep quiet. You’ll get this much 
more after it’s over. Anybody 
crosses us up, we’ll throw him to 
the fish. No heckling, under- 
stand?” 

“This young man, ladies and 
gentlemen, utterly without pre- 
vious experience in the gymnas- 
tic art, will attempt to cross the 
fifteen feet from tower to tower 
against the simultaneous oppo- 
sition of sixteen opponents. They 
will be permitted to jeer, threat- 
en, sound horns and cast gravel, 
but not to shake the towers!” 

A UDIENCE identification, 
thought Norvie. The sixteen 
“opponents” would be there to do 
exactly what the audience wanted 
to do, but was too far away to do. 
Still, a good strong arm with a 
favoring wind and a brick — 
“The special feature of this 



154 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



performance, ladies and gentle- 
men, lies in the tank above which 
this young man will traverse. At 
enormous expense, the Mon- 
mouth Park Association has im- 
ported from the headwaters of the 
Amazon River a school of the 
deadliest fish known to man, the 
famed piranha. Your binoculars, 
ladies and gentlemen! I am about 
to drop a fifty-pound sheep into 
the tank. Kindly watch the re- 
sult!” 

In went the bleating, terrified 
animal — shaved and with a few 
nicks on its side for the scent of 
blood. Then they pulled on the 
rope and hauled out — bloody 
bones. There were still ghastly 
little things flopping and wrig- 
gling, dangling from the skeleton. 
They beat them off into the water 
with sticks as the crowd shrieked 
in delight. 

Just like you, you swine, Nor- 
vie thought. But maybe I won’t 
have to do it — 

The earpiece of his hearing aid 
had slipped a trifle. He looked 
shyly around and pulled it out 
preparatory to readjusting it. 
Then he didn’t readjust it. 
The shrieking crowd, the gloat- 
ing, smacking language of the 
MC, the faint creak in the wind 
of the tower guys — all of it came 
through. 

It was the decision, he told 
himself, not quite knowing what 
he meant. He hadn’t wanted to 



hear any of it; he hadn’t dared 
hear any of it. Not as long as he 
was a part of the horror. 

He went to Norma Lavin and 
put his thin arm around her 
shaking shoulders. “It’s going to 
be all right,” he said. 

She cowered against him, 
wordlessly. 

“I’ve got a boy coming, you 
know,” he told her. 

She gave him a distracted nod, 
her eyes on the tower. 

“And if anything happens,” 
he went on, “it’s only fair they 
should be taken care of — Sandy, 
Virginia and the boy. You’ll re- 
member in case anything hap- 
pens?” She nodded. “There was 
this time in Bay City,” he chat- 
tered. “High wire with piranha. 
A judge — ” She wasn’t paying 
attention. 

He got up and joined Mundin. 
“If anything happens,” he said, 
“it’s only fair that Sandy and 
Virginia and the boy should be 
taken care of.” 

“What are you talking about, 
Norvie?” 

“Just remember. Please re- 
member.” 

T HE drumroll began and the 
MC set fire to the platform 
on which Don Lavin stood. The 
crowd howled as the flames lick- 
ed up and the boy hopped con- 
vulsively forward, his balancing 
pole swaying. 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



155 



The MC yelled angrily at the 
hecklers, “What’s the matter with 
you people? Toot! Chuck gravel! 
What do you think you’re get- 
ting paid for?” 

One of them, a young tough, 
began to swing his rattle, glanc- 
ing nervously at Hubble. Hub- 
ble snapped at him, “A hundred 
more, buster. Now calm down.” 
The tough calmed down and 
gaped at the wire-walker. 

A foot, two feet, the pole sway- 
ing. He has special slippers on, 
Norvell thought. Maybe it’ll be 
all right, I won’t have to do any- 
thing and then I can be com- 
fortably deaf again, buying bat- 
teries for a penance, turning this 
nausea off at will. 

Three feet, four feet, and the 
MC howling with rage: “Get in 



there and fight! Take out your 
horns! Plaster him!” 

Five feet, six feet, and the 
crowd-noise was ugly, ugly as 
blood. In one section, a chant 
had started, one of those foot- 
stomping, hand-clapping things. 

Six feet, seven, and the MC 
was breaking down into sobs. 
“We paid you and this is the way 
you treat us! These fine people 
in the stands. Aren’t you 
ashamed?" 

Eight feet, nine feet, ten feet, 
two-thirds of the way to the 
second tower. Somebody with a 
mighty arm and a following wind 
had found the range. The half- 
brick at the end of its journey 
sailed feebly, p/op, into the tank 
and white-bellied little things 
tore at it and bled themselves 




156 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





and tore at one another. The 
water boiled. 

Suddenly ice-cold, all business, 
Norvie said dryly to Mundin, 
“Be ready to haul him out fast. 
They’ll have him in a minute. 
Remember what I said.” 

He strolled over to Wilkes, 
who was watching the stubborn- 
ly silent hecklers in numb des- 
pair. 

Another half -brick, and this 
one hit the tower. Much maneu- 
vering of the balancing pole and 
a shriek from Norma. 

“No nervous breakdown this 
year, Wilkes,” Norvell said to the 
MC. 

“What? Bligh, they won’t lis- 
ten to me!” 

Thirteen feet, and then the 
brick, unseen, that tapped Don 



GLADIATOR AT LAW 



157 



Lavin between the shoulder 
blades and made him flail the 
pole too hard. 

One last agonized look around 
the arena was all .Norvell could 
take. There was nothing, no 
chair, no cushion, nothing but — 
He grabbed the sobbing Wilkes 
in his arms and lunged into the 
tank for an eternal instant, before 
he could see Don Lavin topple 
and fall. First the water was cool 
and then boiling. 

F OR ten minutes, there was not 
a sane person in the stadium. 
The critics would remember that 
moment all their lives. It was 
greatness, the ultimate master- 
piece of Field Day emotion. 

While the piranhas seethed at 
the far end of the tank, Mundin 
yanked Don Lavin out in one 
heave. Not a soul molested the 
four of them as they walked 
slowly over the bloody sand. 
They passed Candella, who 
stared at them with blind, 
streaming eyes and said, “Mas- 
terpiece! Masterpiece! And I 
knew him! I walked and talked 
with Norvell Bligh! Art can go 
no further. Masterpiece!” 

They picked up Lana and her 
Wabbits from a deserted ready 
room. 

“I saw it,” she said. “Good lit- 
tle man, wasn’t he?” She broke 
off into sobs. “I’ll tell his wife 
and kid,” she sniffed at last. 



“Only — which way should I tell 
it?” 

Mundin thought. Blessed sim- 
plicity. Which way? There were 
undoubtedly a hundred ways, a 
thousand ways, all true and all 
intertwined, of telling about that 
frightful, horrifying, noble mo- 
ment. 

Outside the stadium, the Wab- 
bits were paid and formed fours, 
stumping grimly off toward the 
Belly Rave that Norvell Bligh 
had come to love and serve. 

“I think,” Don Lavin said 
slowly, “I’m awake. All the way. 
And I think I know what woke 
me up. Sis, Charles, Mr. Hubble 
— are we going to give those bot- 
tled ghouls — Green, Charles- 
worth — the business? I say we 
are!” 

“First,” said Hubble practi- 
cally, “let me call Sam. His or- 
ders were to grab up anything 
Coett and Nelson dumped on the 
Exchange. Even if we don’t have 
our majority for tomorrow, we 
should have enough to Rock the 
Boat and Monkey With the Buzz 
Saw, as your two marinated 
friends put it.” 

This incurable levity of mine, 
he thought, and sighed. He noted 
how Norma Lavin was leaning 
on Mundin’s arm and how she 
glanced at him. 

He thought of how his wife 
glanced at him and sighed again, 
this time enviously.

EPILOGUE 

From TYCOON , The Magazine for 

Tycoont: 

After a savagely efficient manage- 
ment raid on the gigantic G-M-I. 
Corporation conducted last week 
during its regular stockholders* meet- 
ing, the winners and new champions, 
Messrs. Hubble and Lavin, issued a 
terse joint statement promising far- 
reaching, deep-rooted policy changes. 

From the BELLY RATE TIMES: 

Now that we enter our second 
year, it is time to pause and take 
stock. I think most of us will be 
pleased by what we see around us. 
The Belly Rave Municipal Associa- 
tion launched by my late husband, 
and of which I now have the honor 
to be president, is flourishing. Mem- 
bership now covers eighteen blocks 
and our Organi/.ed Area covers ten. 
Progress is slow but sure. The re- 
establishment of sewer mains pro- 
ceeds at a gratifying pace and every- 
where one sees busy hands and 
happy faces. Truly, as my revered 
husband used to say, “Self-help is 
the only kind that sticks.** 

From the MONMOUTH NEWS: 

Newly elected Senator Mundin 
left for Washington today in his 
private ’copter after reaffirming his 
election pledge to raze Old New 
York to the ground. “We need the 
metals,” he said, “and we need the 



room. I cannot understand why this 
condemned slum has been tolerated 
for many years past the legal date 
for its extinction. Esthetically speak- 
ing, it is also a dreadful eyesore — 
particularly the old Empire State 
Building. It must arid will be de- 
stroyed.” The Senator’s attractive 
wife, nee Norma Lavin, accompanied 
him . 

From The FIELD DAY FAN: 

The cranks are at it again. Those 
mysteriously financed leaflets and 
broadcasts and lobbies for compul- 
sory hours of anti-Field Day “educa- 
tion*’ in the public schools have 
again flared up. Your legal, rational, 
traditional entertainment is again 
under attack. For the third time in 
as many months, this magazine is 
compelled to solicit contributions 
that will offset its declining circula- 
tion. Attendance figures are down 
across the nation. But this is not a 
gloomy picture. The Field Day fans 
have been stripped to their hard 
core of true enthusiasts . sincerity 
. artistic triumph. Vapid reform- 
ers and their bloodless ilk . utter 
inability to comprehend such mo- 
ments of truth, such avalanches of 
emotion as were unleashed in the 
great old days upon the stunned 
spectator. In this context, we need no 
more than mention with due rever- 
ence the great name Noneell Blythe l 
— FREDERIK POHL 
& C. M. KORNBLIITH 



FORECAST 

Next month's big issue will contain complete stories only . and it 
leads off with F. L. Wallace's provocatively titled novelet THE MAN WHO 
WAS SIX. What's it about? Well, there is nothing like having a sound 
mind in a sound body— but Dan Merrol had too much of one— and also too 
much of the other! 

SATAN'S SHRINE, another novelet by Daniel F. Galouye, offers the 
most fiendish torment ever inflicted on humanity. But Satan was worse than 
a devil ... he was a manl
