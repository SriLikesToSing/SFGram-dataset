NOVELETTES 

THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA, Christopher Irwin 8 

A story of endings, beginnings — and a vast 
sea-change. 

THE WALLAD BLONDE, M.A. Bartter 127 

The trouble with attempting to artificially control 
any natural phenomenon is that no matter how 
rigorous your methodology you may still over- 
look some vital factor. And when the 
phenomenon in question is human genetics. 

SHORT STORIES 

THE TIDES OF TIME, Gordon Ekiund 44 

Though they moved at will through the stream 
of time and could alter the very structure of re- 
ality, still they were not at all like gods. 



NO RENEWAL, Spider Robinson 151 

The world had changed and he had not: the 
story of Douglas Bent, Jr.'s last stand. 

SERIAL (Part III of III) 

GATEWAY, Frederik Pohl 60 

Broadhead finally got up the courage to take a 
trip — and “came up empty." He has only one 
option, now.

The sea glowed rust-color under 
the copper sky. 

Liz stepped from the cruiser onto 
the white hexagonal structure that 
represented the only surface dock of 
the underwater city. Nearby, waves 
lapped softly against the radio buoy 
that pointed up to the sky. 

A young man took her luggage 
and escorted her to the open hatch 
of a small submarine that floated in 
one of the slot-like piers. 

He did not introduce himself. 

“Hi, my name’s Liz Devlin. 
New World News Service. I believe 
Professor Eastlake is expecting 
me?” 

“Sure,” the man said. 

“And you are — ” 

“Sorry. My name’s Don. Don 
Carus. As you can see. I’m not 
used to meeting new people. Down 
below we’re all used to knowing 
each other.” 

Suddenly self-conscious, he 
tucked his T-shirt into his jeans. 

“Don’t you ever go on land?” 
Liz asked. 

“Not very often.” 

She climbed the metal steps to 
the hatch of the sub. When she got 
to the top, she stopped and looked 
out on the gleaming tropical sea. 

“Hey,” she exclaimed, pointing 
to starboard. “Are those por- 
poises?” 

“Yes,” Don said. “Tursiops 
truncatus — the bottlenose dolphin.” 

“Why are they swimming in a 
circle?” 

“They’re sleeping. This particu- 
THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA 



lar group does that all the time. 
They keep their right eyes open for 
about ten minutes, and then change 
position and keep only their left 
eyes open. Only half of their brains 
are asleep at any one time, and they 
can all keep watch.” 

“No kidding?” 

“No, I watch them a lot. There 
are a lot of porpoises around here. 
They’re almost a nuisance.” 

“Are you a marine biologist?” 
she asked. 

“Computer programmer,” he re- 
plied. “But the sea’s my real 
love.” 

“How many of you are there 
down below?” Liz asked, climbing 
into the cabin. 

“About two hundred,” Don said 
as he stooped over to avoid hitting 
his head on the ceiling. “But 
they’re building some new domes to 
accommodate more. Have a seat.” 

The contour chairs faced a curved 
glass window that looked out into 
the shimmering light of the ocean. 
Behind these seats were four metre, 
obviously for passengers. Don 
strapped the luggage onto a 
chromium rack set to one side. 

“How long can you stay with 
us?” he asked. 

“A couple of weeks,” she said. 
“After that. I’m scheduled to cover 
the latest war in South Africa.” 

“You get around,” Don said. 

“I try to.” 

Don pulled a lever on the control 
pa.nel of the vehicle. A hiss of 
compressed air told her that the 

9 




hatch had just closed. 

“Don,” she said, “answer one 
question now, before we go down 
there?” 

“Sure. Fire away.” 

“What is going on? Why did 
Eastlake call this ‘a matter of world 
concern’? 1 thought this was just an 
archaeological expedition.” 

“I’m not authorized to tell you 
any details,” he said. “I haven’t 
been told all of them myself. But 
what would you say if I told you 
that this expedition has turned up 
evidence that there were humans — 
or at least creatures that were struc- 
turally indistinguishable from our- 
selves — at least sixty million years 
before we thought?” 

“I’d say you were crazy.” 

“So would the people who 
funded this project. That’s why 
Eastlake wanted you to come.” 

Don pushed in the steering wheel 
and the sub tilted forty-five degrees 
nose down. Below them, in the 
dark green waters of the depths, Liz 
saw a cluster of glowing lights. She 
clutched the arms of her chair as 
they plunged downward from the 
gleaming surface. 

“Living in three instead of two 
dimensions takes a little getting 
used to,” Don said as he noticed 
her discomfort. “After a while, 
you’ll get accustomed to thinking in 
terms of depth as well as distance.” 
“What’s the pressure like down 
there?” 

“The Center was built one 
hundred feet down off the main is- 

10 



land. Actually, we’re living on an 
underwater mountainside. The pres- 
sure of the water is about four at- 
mospheres, but inside the domes 
you won’t feel it at all because 
they’re kept at surface pressure.” 
“Don’t you ever feel uneasy 
when you think of all that water 
above your heads?” 

“No, I love the sea.” 

“I don’t know if I could live 
here,” she said. “For any length of 
time, I mean. I think I’d mind 
being cut off from the rest of the 
world for very long.” 

“See that cable?’’ Don said, 
pointing to a long thread that ex- 
tended from one of the domes up 
through the twilit water to the sur- 
face. 

“That’s our umbilical cord to the 
rest of the world — or what’s left of 
it. It leads to the dish antenna you 
saw beside the dock. Our radio and 
TV network is linked via that an- 
tenna to the satellite communication 
system.” 

“I see,” Liz said. 

“Frankly, there are times I feel 
like cutting that cable.” 

The points of light Liz had seen 
from the surface now towered over 
her like huge glowing mushrooms. 
She could see people moving 
around inside the glass domes; large 
globes of light at the top of the 
structures provided the necessary il- 
lumination. In front of the colony of 
glass bubbles, wayward schools of 
fish glided by like silver clouds. 

Don guided the miniature sub- 



GALAXY 




marine to a port located at the bot- 
tom of one of the domes. Doors 
closed behind them; air jetted in as 
the water drained through grids in 
the floor. 

“Here we are,” Don announced. 
“Welcome to Atlantis II.” 

* * * 

“I’m sure our hbme audience 
would like to know the significance 
of your find, Professor Eastlake. 
Would you elaborate on that a bit*?” 

The gray-haired man sitting be- 
tween the panelists sat forward in 
his chair. He looked ancient and 
fragile under the blue-white lights. 

“I hesitate to draw conclusions,” 
he said slowly and dramatically, 
“when all the evidence is not yet 
in. Months — no, years — of careful 
study and evaluation will have to 
follow this excavation before we 
can say exactly what message these 
findings hold for mankind. But 1 
can tell you this; we have already 
learned that all our previous views 
on human pre-history will have to 
be discarded. There is no doubt that 
these hominid remains are genuine, 
and that they date from at least the 
late Cretaceous period — roughly 
sixty-five to seventy million years 
ago.” 

“Professor,” one of the panelists 
said, “excuse me for interrupting, 
but we have had hoaxes before. 
Like the famous Piltdown man at 
the beginning of the twentieth cen- 
tury.” 

THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA 



“Are you accusing me of perpe- 
trating a hoax?” Eastlake de- 
manded sharply. 

His questioner did not reply. 

Nervous whispers filled the au- 
ditorium. 

Don and Liz stood at the back of 
the large rooms and watched the 
interview. Heavy cables connecting 
TV cameras to tape decks snaked 
across the floor under their feet. 

“I didn’t want you to miss the 
panel discussion,” Don said. “I’ll 
show you to your room later.” 

“Who’s on the panel?” Liz 
asked. 

“Untrustworthy media,” Don 
said. “The only news service 
Eastlake trusts is ‘The New World.’ 
He’ll tell you more than he’s telling 
those barracudas. But he won’t tell 
you everything, I guarantee.” 

“Why not?” 

“He says he doesn’t want the 
news to be sensationalized, but 
frankly I think he’s just milking this 
thing for all the drama it’s worth.” 

“1 don’t like secrecy,” Liz said. 

“Professor Eastlake,” one of the 
panelists asked, breaking the embar- 
rassed silence, “you say these re- 
mains date from the Cretaceous 
period. Assuming they’re genuine, 
as you insist, what kind of world 
did this distant ancestor of ours live 
in?” 

“It was a world,” Eastlake re- 
plied stiffly, “similar to ours in 
many respects, and yet startlingly 
different in others. First, the late 
dinosaurs had all but died out by 

11 




the time of our earliest humanoid. 
The climate was growing steadily 
cooler. The flying reptiles of the 
Jurassic had evolved into creatures 
closely resembling modem birds. 
The swamplands that had sustained 
the dinosaurs were receding. An- 
giosperms had spread rapidly all 
over the earth. Much of the land- 
scape must have looked strangely 
modem: specimens of maple, birch, 
and poplar have been found in 
many strata dating from this time. 
There were also early rabbits, tur- 
tles, and frogs.” 

“Paul,” the one panelist said to 
the other, “geology is up your al- 
ley. Why don’t you take it from 
here?” 

“Glad to, Frank,” the other re- 
plied. “Professor, how does conti- 
nental drift fit into the picture?” 

“Is this whole thing going to be 
televised?” Liz asked Don. 

‘‘Through most of the world 
satellite-corn network. Eastlake 
never had so much glory. Look at 
him; he’s eating it up. By the way, 
do you play chess?” 

“What?” 

“Chess. Do you play?” 

“No.” 

“How about backgammon?” 
“No.” 

“Do you play at all?” 

“Shh. I want to hear the discus- 
sion.” 

‘‘Then the continents looked 
pretty much the way they do to- 
day?” the panelist asked. 

“Pretty much,” Eastlake said. 



“Gondwana had broken into what 
we now call South America and Af- 
rica earlier, during the Jurassic. 
They may still have been connected 
at their northern extremity at this 
time, however. Also, North 
America and Europe were much 
closer together than they are now. It 
is my personal opinion that the Ca- 
nary islands, where we are now lo- 
cated, were formed earlier than 
anyone has thought. Thanks to the 
underwater excavation techniques 
developped by Schaffer and Roth 
during the last five years, we’ve 
been able to investigate underwater 
beds previously inaccessible. 
Geologic dating has determined the 
age of these mountainous structures 
to be late Cretacean. The division 
of the super-continents into the sep- 
arate plates caused much volcanic 
activity all over the planet. Judging 
from our recent evidence, the vol- 
canic activity that formed these 
mountains was then followed by a 
very gradual subsidence. The small 
piece of continent comprising the 
homeland of our earliest human-like 
creature began to sink into the 
sea.” 

“What happened then. Profes- 
sor?” one of the panelists asked. 
“What became of this species of 
so-called man? Why hasn’t evidence 
of his existence been found any- 
where else?” 

“That, gentlemen,” the old man 
said earnestly, “is the missing piece 
of the jigsaw puzzle. We cannot say 
for sure.”

GALAXY 




“Could the sinking of the land 
have caused them to die out?” 

“How many of them were there, 
Professor?” 

“Could they have been limited to 
this vicinity?” 

“Gentlemen, please, one question 
at a time,” Eastlake said, holding 
up his hands in mock-surrender. 

“First, we have found only one 
specimen so far — part of a jawbone. 
We have no idea how many there 
were. Second, we have no idea yet 
whether these proto-humans wer^ in 
a direct line of evolution to us or 
not. Last, we don’t know what hap- 
pened to these creatures. Volcanic 
upheaval could have killed them 
off, the sinking of the land could 
have gradually flooded all the fertile 
land and destroyed all the plants 
and game that they fed on. It’s still 
too early to say. At this very mo- 
ment a team of archaeologists is out 
there searching for more data. 
When we discover more, we’ll tell 
you. Have no fear about that.” 

“Professor,” one of the panelists 
called out as the old man stood up 
to leave. “Professor, back in the 
1950’s, fossils, and I believe even 
meteorites, were found that had 
traces of certain protein molecules 
on them. Now, viruses are basically 
proteins, am I correct?” 

“Yes.” 

“Is there any chance that one of 
the specimens you’re unearthing 
could still carry traces of a virus 
that maybe wiped out the entire 
population of these early humans?’ ’ 

THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA 



Eastlake smiled. 

“If you’re suggesting that we 
may be unleashing an ancient 
plague on the earth once more, the 
answer is no.” 

“Is that a definite ‘no’ ”? 

“The chances of that happening 
are a billion — no, a trillion — to one. 
Now if you’ll excuse me, I see our 
half-hour is up and I have some 
very pressing matters to attend to.” 

* * * 

“This is your room,” Don said, 
opening the door. 

Liz walked in and looked around. 
It was surprisingly spacious; before 
coming here, she had pictured the 
dome’s living quarters as being 
stuffy and cramped, like the rooms 
in old-fashioned submarines. 

“Eastlake will be able to talk 
with you in a couple hours. Are you 
hungry?’ ’ 

“No, thanks,” she said. 

“See you later then.” 

He shut the door behind him as 
he left. 

Liz sat down on the edge of the 
bed and extracted her camera from 
her travel case. It was clear to her 
that something strange was going on 
here, and Don looked like a good 
source of information. She adjusted 
the camera for the light level in the 
room and took a picture. 

It was a sterile-looking room. 
The few pieces of furnishing looked 
like they had been purchased from 
an economy motel; small dresser, 
wall TV, glossy Kodachrome print 

13 




of a meadow full of red poppies. 
Suddenly she realized why the room 
was so bare; all the furniture had 
been brought laboriously from the 
surface, piece by piece. The far 
wall WHS hidden by a curtain. Pull- 
ing the cord that hung at one end 
she discovered ifiat it was a 
window — a picture-window over- 
looking the undersea mountainside. 
She could see some of the other 
domes farther down the slope, 
glowing yellow-green in the darken- 
ing sea. The domes were connected 
with glass passageways that ex- 
tended from the large main-dome 
like spokes on a wheel. 

For a brief moment she felt an 
almost overwhelming sense of peace 
as she stood there looking out into 
the sea. It was so quiet there, so 
unbelievably quiet. The horrors and 
wars of the surface suddenly 
seemed as far away as the dark side 
of the moon. Here she felt pro- 
tected. It was not an unpleasant 
feeling. 

* * ★ 

Eastlake’s study looked like a 
bomb had gone off in a bookcase; 
piles of computer print-outs, books, 
and boxes of meticulously tagged 
artifacts cluttered every available 
surface. Liz sat on a leather chair 
by the Professor’s large desk and 
took some pictures. A large tile 
mosaic filled the wall behind the 
desk. She had to use a wide-angle 
lens to get all of it in the view- 
finder. 



“That mosaic looks like pictures 
I’ve seen of the ruins of Crete,” 
she said. 

“The palace of Minos,” Don 
said, “at Knossos. It was copied 
from one there. Eastlake liked the 
dolphin motif. Do you know a lot 
about archaeology?’ ’ 

Liz shook her head. 

“Only what I see on TV.” 

“Good for you. It’s all a pack of 
lies anyway.” 

“Why so cynical?” Liz asked. 
“Don’t you believe in the project?” 
“If there’s anything that this pro- 
ject’s proved it’s that archaeology’s 
a pack of lies, a house of cards 
built on guesses made about a 
couple old bones and pieces of pot- 
tery. When a new piece of bone is 
discovered that doesen’t agree with 
the guesses already made, BANG! 
All those brilliant theories are 
blown into a million pieces, and we 
realize we had it wrong all along.” 
“That’s the way science is,” Liz 
sa^. “You know that.” 

“All I can say is, it’s a hell of a 
way to make a living.” 

“You sound like one of the Do- 
Nothings up on dry land,” Liz said 
with a note of revulsion. 

“Yeah, well don’t act so 
superior. They have a point.” 

“Oh, sure,” Liz exclaimed, 
“they’re wonderful people — doing 
nothing but sitting around and 
watching tri-D TV, going to parties 
and drinking themselves to death — ” 
“Sounds good to me,” Don inter- 
jected. “Come to think of it, that’s 



14

exactly what this place needs — a party. 
Let’s have a masquerade; we’ll all 
come as our favorite fish.” 

“How can you talk like this? You, 
one of the few people in the world 
privileged to work on this project!” 
‘ ‘I could wear nothing but a sprig of 
parsley and a slice of lemon and come 
as a haddock dinner — ’ ’ 

“You’re helping to broaden the 
horizons of knowledge.” 

“Hey, save that for your news ser- 
vice. I don’t buy it.” 

Don walked over to the w indo w .His 
face looked gaunt in the greenish light. 

“We’re just talking about making 
more guesses,” he said slowly. “And 
time is running out, in case you’ve 
forgotten.” 

“But—” 

“You must be Liz Devlin,” aman’s 
voice said behind them. 

Liz recognized Professor Eastlake. 
He was carrying an armload of print- 
outs and was wearing a spotless white 
labcoatand a red-and-black striped tie. 

“Liz,” Don said, rising. “Let me 
introduce you to the High Lama. Pro- 
fessor Eastlake, Liz Devlin of the New 
World News Service. Liz Devlin, Pro- 
fessor Eastlake. And now, if you’ll 
excuse me, I have a program to run.” 
He nodded to the ftofessor and left. 
“What’s with him?” Liz asked. 
“Hard to say,” Eastlake said, shak- 
ing his head. “He’s a strange bird.” 
“Why do you keep him on?” she 
asked. “He must be pretty disruptive 
for the project.” 

“We have no choice,” the Profes- 
sor said , sitting behind his desk .“ He’ s 

THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA 



a genius, and our chief of computer 
operations. You’ve heard of Von 
Aachen’s lobe?” 

“ Yes, ” Liz said ,“ the enlarged area 
of the cortex of the brain. He has 
that?” 

“Yes,” Eastlake said, “for betteror 
worse. I’m not convinced that muta- 
tion accounts for his intelligence , but it 
may account for his instability.” 
“But he’s a genius?” 

“Oh, yes,” Eastlake said wearily, 
“and besides, when he began writing 
the programs for our system here he 
used a computer language of his own 
invention. Since he does his work 
adequately and it would be very expen- 
sive to duplicate his initial programs, 
he effectively secured his job.” 

“1 don’t care what he is,” Liz said, 
“I don’t like him. He’s too cynical.” 
“Well,” Eastlake said, smoothing 
back his wiry white hair, “these are 
cynical times. Speaking of which, 
what’s the latest from above? I haven’t 
had time to watch the news for 
weeks.” 

“Nothing’s changed,” Liz said, 
taking her tape recorder from her 
purse. “Things are as bad as they’ve 
always been. Maybe a bit worse.” 
“More riots?” 

“All the time. They’re not even 
news anymore. Another famine has 
broken out in North Africa. This one 
may be the worst yet.” 

“I see,” he said, nodding gravely. 

‘ ‘The thing that bothers me. Profes- 
sor, is that a lot of capable people are no 
longer willing to work toward a solu- 
tion.”

“You can’t blame them.” 

“I can blame them,” Liz said. “I 
don’t believe it’s ever too late to find 
answers.” 

“Yes,” Eastlake replied, “yes, of 
course.” 

“But, Professor,” she continued, 
“I’m here to talk to you about your 
project. Do you mind if I record our 
conversation?” 

“No, go ahead.” 

She placed the small machine on the 
desk between them and turned it on. 

“Professor Eastlake; just what is it 
you’ve found here and why do you 
think it’s so important?” 

‘ ‘ Let me the old man began ,“ an- 
swer the second part of your question 
first. Why do 1 think it’s important? 
You might as well ask: why do I think 
archaeology’s important. 1 will tell 
you. It is the only branch of science 
which studies interrelationships be- 
tween human beings and the rest of the 
planet over long periods of time. And 
we have to know these things in order 
to understand what is happening to us 
now and what will happen in the future . 
This has always been important 
knowledge , and 1 don ’ t ha ve to tell you 
how much more important it’s become 
in the last few decades. Now, as for 
what we’ve found: it is nothing less 
than conclusive evidence that there 
were human-like beings on this earth 
more than sixty million years ago. 
That’s sixty times earlier than was pre- 
viously thought.” 

“Professor, if that’s true, it turns 
everything we’ve ever thought about 
our origins upside-down. Our sub- 

16 



scribers will want to know why evi- 
dence like this hasn’t come to light 
before.” 

“Come to light,” Eastlake re- 
peated, “that’s the key phrase. The 
evidence had simply not seen the light 
of day before this — literally. Before 
we can study relics orremains, we have 
to find them. On land they may be 
turned up accidentally , say during road 
excavation, or they may be brought to 
light by the gradual erosion of a stream. 
But we do have to find it. And that is no 
easy job.” 

He rubbed his hands together as he 
spoke. The thick lenses of his glasses 
focused the glow of the overhead lamp 
into half-moons of light on his cheeks. 

“Geologists at the Center here 
stumbled across some artifacts — ” 

“Artifacts!” Liz interrupted. “You 
mean like tools or weapons? 1 didn’t 
know — ’ ’ 

“I’ll explain that in time. Miss Dev- 
lin. Please. Geologists found these 
things accidently, while they were 
looking for undersea mineral deposits. 
Thanks to special techniques develop- 
ed only in the last twenty years, we 
were then able to commence a careful 
and methodical excavation of this site. 
That excavation is proceeding at this 
very moment. We have teams of 
highly trained people working around 
the clock with mini subs and scuba 
gear.” 

“Around the clock?” 

“Time is precious.” 

‘ ‘But professor, it seems to me that 
some traces of these early humans 
would ha ve been found before . I mean , 



GALAXY 




fossils dating back to earlier periods 
have been found all over the world, 
haven’t they?” 

“True,” Eastlake said, “but don’t 
take these fossils for granted. Think of 
the enormous amount of time we’re 
talking about. Think of it — sixty mil- 
lion years! It’s amazing that anything 
survives that long, isn’t it — 
considering the changes the earth goes 
through , all the tectonic forces it ’ s sub- 
jected to. Also, don’t forget that it 
takes very special conditionstocreatea 
fossil . They’re almost always found in 
beds of rock formed from soft marsh- 
land or the soft ooze that settled on the 
floors of the early inland .seas. If a 
variety of creature once lived only on 
the rocky slopes of mountains it’s very 
possible that no fossil record was ever 
left.” 

“You’re saying that’s the case 
here?” 

“All 1 can give you now is theories. 
Another theory is that these early 
homonids were few in number, and 
limited in geographical distribution. If 
that’s the case, then the probability of 
anyone finding a trace of them sixty 
million years later is very, very small 
indeed. Especially if they cremated 
their dead .which they probably did . ’ ’ 
“That’s right. 1 forgot.” 

‘ ‘There might be some traces of car- 
bon and other organic chemicals in the 
soil,” he added, “but these would be 
very hard to detect and evaluate.” 
“But tell me this. Professor, did we 
evolve from these early men?” 

“Oh, no, highly unlikely. They 
were too early.”

“Modem man didn’t appear until 
about a million years ago, right?” 

“Judging by the evidence collected 
so far,” Eastlake said cautiously. 

‘ Then how did these early humans 
have time to develop way back then? 
Why did it take modem man so long to 
evolve?” 

“Well, you know, simple duration 
of time isn’t the only factor involved 
with evolution. There are a lot of fac- 
tors which are only vaguely 
understood. Take the cockroach, for 
example; this insect has been on the 
earth practically since the beginning 
of life, and it’s hardly changed at all 
up to the present time.” 

“Professor, you mentioned ar- 
tifacts. What exactly are these ar- 
tifacts?” 

Eastlake thought for a moment be- 
fore replying. The turning wheels of 
the recorder collected only the hushed 
whisper of the air conditioning as the 
old man stared at his desk. Finally he 
looked at her. 

“1 haven’t told this to anyone from 
the outside yet. I felt the time wasn’t 
right. But I trust you and your service to 
handle it carefully . The first object that 
was found turned out to be something 
resembling the blade of a knife. It was 
covered with concretion, and looked 
like a lump of fossil coral. The proton 
magnetometer, however, indicated 
that it contained metal , and X-raying it 
later revealed the object inside. I have 
it here.” 

He opened a drawer of the desk , and 
produced a small piece of metal. 

“Amazing,” Liz said as he handed 

18 



it to her. “It is a knife blade. That 
means these early men were intelli- 
gent. That’s incredible!” 

“Be careful with that word ‘intelli- 
gent,’ ” Eastlake warned. “I called 
you here because your news service 
has a reputation for sobriety. I don’t 
want a lot of cranks on the surface to 
start braying ‘Atlantis! Atlantis!’ As 
far as I’m concerned that whole busi- 
ness is just a myth recorded by Plato 
from some bronze-age folk tales about 
the continent of America. Nothing 
more.” 

“Professor, just what kind of metal 
is this knife made from?’ ’ 

‘ ‘ Steel , Miss Devlin . That artifact is 
sixty-million- year-old steel.” 

★ * * 

It was late, and the lounge was 
empty except for Liz. 

She paced back and forth, haunted 
by insomnia, while all but the night 
shift of divers slept . What Don had said 
about Eastlake bothered her; 
Eastlake’s bickering with Don 
bothered her. The place in general 
seemed to be overshadowed by some 
vague fear, and the excitement of dis- 
covery was diluted by this shadow . She 
could sense that not all was right. 

The TV flickered on the wall. 

The last person to leave the room had 
forgotten to turn it off. A news program 
about the surface was going on un- 
noticed. 

Early the next morning, Liz was 
awakened by the sound of running 
footsteps in the hall. Groggy from 

GALAXY 




practically no sleep, she dressed as fa§t 
as she could and grabbed her camera. 
Out in the hall she spotted Don. He was 
wearing blue jeans and looked like he 
hadn’t shaved in a couple of days. 

“Hey, what’sgoing on?’’ she called 
out to him. 

‘ ‘The last team of divers brought in a 
lot of artifacts,” he said. “Come on. 
I’ll show you the lab.” 

“I thought you weren’t interested in 
this ‘serious’ work,” she said, walking 
briskly beside him. 

“Anything to break the 
monotony,” he said. “Even work. 
Besides, I have to run the statistical 
programs.” 

T^e lab was crowded with dozens of 
people, each intent on a different task. 
Eastlake sat at a long table, bent over a 
stereo microscope. An assistant was 
holding what looked like a piece of 
rock against the rotating blade of a 
circular saw. 

“Don,” Eastlake called out, “it’s 
about time you got here. Would it be 
asking too much for you to do yourjob? 
We need some statistics analyzed.” 

“Right away,” Don said, saluting. 

He walked over to a computer ter- 
minal and started to key some direc- 
tions. 

“Mr. Hsiung,” Eastlake said, “do 
you have that thin-section ready yet?’ ’ 

The man at the saw shook his head. 

“It’ll be a couple minutes yet.” 

Not wanting to get in the way, Liz 
walked quietly around the room and 
took some pictures. In a few moments, 
she felt a tap on her shoulder. It was 
Don. 



“How about some coffee?” he 
asked. 

“Yeah, sure. I’d love some.” 

He handed her a chipped china cup 
full of rich-looking coffee. It smelled 
great. 

“It’s real,” he said. 

“How’d you manage that?” she 
asked, taking a sip. 

“Government research has its 
privileges.” 

“What do you think of the lab?” 

“I’m impressed.” 

“All paid for by people who 
haven’t the faintest idea what it’s 
being used for.” 

He drank some coffee. 

Behind him lights on one of the 
computer consoles were blinking on 
and off in shifting patterns of red 
and green. 

“What’s it doing?” she asked 
him. 

“Statistical analysis of the posi- 
tion where the latest artifacts were 
found,” he replied. “The position 
of each was measured against a 
wire grid by the divers and recorded 
on a waterproof slate. This informa- 
tion was encoded on tape and fed 
into the memory banks a little while 
ago. I Just had it start a program to 
determine whether the distribution 
of these objects was random or 
not.” 

“What will that tell?” 

“It’ll tell us whether the objects 
came from the same time period, or 
whether the site has been contami- 
nated by shifting in the bedding 
planes.” 



THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA

“What exactly are these artifacts 
they found?” Liz asked him. 

“Bricks,” he said. “Looks like 
part of a foundation.” 

* ★ 

The two of them floated in the 
green water- over the excavation 
site. They watched the soft light 
that filtered down from the surface 
play on the reef below. The divers, 
in their black wetsuits, looked like 
tadpoles. 

“I’m glad you could take me to 
the site,” Liz said, staring out the 
window of the mini-sub. 

“Don’t mention it,” Don said. 

“What are they doing now?” 

“See that machine off to the 
right?” 

He pointed to a rather large 
machine bristling with hoses and 
pipes. It made a pinging noise in 
the sub’s sonar, like the sound of 
moving pistons or gears. 

Liz looked at it and nodded. 

“That’s what makes underwater 
excavation like this possible. It’s 
basically a pump; it’s connected to 
a fine matrix of pipes bedded 
around the trench they’re digging. It 
siphons off the turbidity raised by 
the trowels.” 

“Do you think they’ll come 
across any more human remains?” 

“We may find something. Who 
knows? Sixty million years is a long 
time.” 

“Isn’t it strange,” Liz said, “that 
they’ve dug all those trenches and 

20 



found only a couple of bricks and a 
piece of bone.” 

Don shrugged. 

“Hey, look. There’s one of my 
friends.” 

“Who—” 

And then Liz saw the dolphin off 
the port side. It shot over the exca- 
vation site and made playful circles 
over the heads of the divers. 

“You mean that porpoise?” Liz 
asked. 

“The divers have given him the 
name ‘Diomedes.’ You can tell him 
from the others by the little nick 
taken out of his dorsal fin. His real 
name is ‘Ikikee.’ ” 

“What do mean ‘his real 
name?’ ” 

“That’s what he calls himself,” 
Don said. “A little while back I 
was trying to talk to it over sonar. I 
kept saying ‘Don’ and it kept re- 
peating the sound ‘Ikikee’ over and 
over. When I finally said ‘Ikikee’ 
over the sonar, it replied with a 
sound that roughly approximated 
‘Don.’ I assumed ‘Ikikee’ was his 
name.” 

“That’s ridiculous.” 

“They’re smart critters,” he said. 
“Don’t sell them short.” 

“The navy gave up their dolphin 
experiments long ago,” Liz said. 
“They concluded they were no 
more intelligent than dogs.” 

“If a human judges intelligence, 
he’s going to use himself as a 
model. If a dog judges intelligence, 
he’s going to use himself as a 
model. The navy researchers didn’t 



GALAXY 




find intelligence in dolphins simply 
because they were looking for the 
wrong thing.” 

“Oh, I see,” Liz said sarcastical- 
ly- 

“You don’t believe me?” 

“1 didn’t say that.” 

“You know their brains are about 
the size of ours, with the same 
complicated neural exchanges we 
associate with abstract reasoning.” 
“If they’re so smart,” Liz said, 
“why are they still doing nothing 
but swimming around and eating 
fish?” 

“What would you like them to 
do?” Don smiled. 

“Well, something — something 
creative.” 

“They have creative play. And 
they have a complex social organi- 
zation and a lot of sensitivity to 
each other. Look at Dcikee there try- 
ing to relate to that diver.” 

The dolphin was nudging one of 
the archaeologists with his snout, 
and then bolting away, as though 
trying to start up a game. 

“Look at him,” Don said. “See 
how he’s trying to communicate?” 
“Just like a dog with a rubber 
bone,” Liz replied. 

“You just haven’t lived with 
them long enough. Just wait til 
you’ve been down here a while. 
You’ll see how human they are. So 
human it’s almost scary.” 

“Eastlake told me you were 
spending too much time with these 
pets of yours. I believe him.” 

“Oh, yeah?” Well Eastlake 

THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA 



could tell you a few things about 
dolphins too, if he wanted to.” 

“What is that supposed to 
mean?” Liz said with the sharp 
edge of a reporter’s voice. 

“Nothing,” Don said. 

“No, come on. Why did you say 
that?” 

“He’s had some interesting expe- 
riences with them, that’s all. You 
can’t help interacting with them 
here because you live among them. 
Eastlake just doesn’t like talking 
about them because he’s secretly 
afraid they’re smarter than he is.” 

Liz laughed. 

“Want to hear a story?” Don 
asked. 

“About what?” 

“About a near cousin of our 
fiiend here — the orca.” 

“Orca?” 

“The so-called killer whale.” 

“Sure, go ahead.” 

Don sat back in his seat and rest- 
ed his hands behind his head. He 
looked off into the miles of water as 
he spoke. 

“The Indians of. the Northwest 
have a lot of stories about whales. 
One of them goes like this: once — 
not too long ago — a couple Indians 
were out fishing a little distance off. 
shore. It was growing late, a cold 
wind was blowing off the sea, and 
they were growing restless. It was 
then that they spotted an orca 
swimming not far away. Out of 
boredom as much as anything else, 
they paddled closer to the gleaming 
black and white body of the crea- 



21 




ture. When they got within a 
hundred feet of the orca, one of the 
Indians threw one of the stones they 
used for weighting their nets at the 
whale. It hit the orca on the dorsal 
fin, and the whale then plunged 
under water and headed toward 
land. A little* later these same In- 
dians saw smoke from a campfire 
trailing from the shore. They grew 
curious about it, and went in to in- 
vestigate. 

There they saw a large canoe 
near where the orca had been 
headed. A giant of a man sat by a 
fire and glared at them. ‘Why did 
you throw stones at me?’ the man 
asked. ‘You damaged my canoe. 
Go into the forest and get some 
bark to fix it.’ 

The Indians did as the giant di- 
rected, and when they had patched 
the hole in the canoe, the man told 
them to hide their eyes while he 
left. After a few minutes had gone 
by, however, the Indians took their 
hands away from their eyes and saw 
the man leaving in his canoe. As he 
got beyond the breakers, they saw 
him no more. All they saw was a 
large orca heading out to sea.” 

During the pause that followed 
the story, a gentle swell rocked the 
sub. 

‘‘It’s a nice story,” Liz said. 

‘‘And a very common one,” Don 
added. ‘‘Examples of it have been 
collected among peoples all over the 
world. Some tribes in Alaska still 
carve figurines that show a man in- 
side a whale’s belly.” 

22 



“Jonah,” Liz said in a tone of 
recognition. 

“It’s one of mankind’s oldest 
stories,” Don said. “The origins of 
it are lost in the stone age.” 

Liz looked out the window again. 

“Look,” she said suddenly. 
“One of the divers is holding some- 
thing.” 

★ * 

“It’s a skull!” Eastlake an- 
nounced, clasping his hands to- 
gether in triumph. “We’ve finally 
got something people will take seri- 
ously.” 

He walked over to his desk and 
pressed a button on the intercom. 

“Tell Winters to bring in the 
skull. I want to brief Miss Devlin 
on the latest developments in our 
search . ’ ’ 

Liz took out her recorder and 
placed it on the desk. 

“At last I can tell your readers 
something worth listening to,” he 
said. 

“This is what Don and I saw un- 
earthed this afternoon?” 

“Yes,” Eastlake said. “It was 
found in the same bedding plane as 
the other artifacts. Our preliminary 
tests confirm the geologic dating. It 
is roughly sixty-five million years 
old, plus or minus a thousand 
years.” 

“What do your tests consist of?” 
Liz asked. 

“You really want the details?” 

“In layman’s language,” Liz 

GALAXY 




said. “Our subscribers will want to 
know everything.” 

“Okay,” the Professor began, 
sitting down, “here is what we’ve 
done. We used several dating 
methods. One, the fission-track 
technique, can date materials such 
as certain types of glass and crystal- 
line minerals accurately for ages be- 
tween twenty years and a billion 
years. In short, what happens is 
this: the spontaneous fission of 
uranium-238 through time causes 
microscopic damage trails in these 
materials. The more tracks there 
are, you see, the older the object is. 
A sample of the material in question 
is exposed to a controlled amount of 
thermal neutrons. The number of 
tracks this produces allows us to ad- 



just our count for the varying 
amounts of uranium found in differ- 
ent samples. Our samples here were 
some quartz objects — possibly 
ornaments — found near the knife 
blades.” 

“Did you use carbon-14 dating?” 

“No, no,” Eastlake said, “the 
half-life of carbon is only about 
5,568 years. So at ages beyond 
sixty thousand years the amount of 
error becomes so great that the 
technique is useless. Likewise, 
potassium-argon dating is practical 
only up to three million years. This 
project has posed special problems. 
Naturally, geologists have examined 
the materials comprising the bed- 
ding planes and established relative 
dating that has supported the abso-

lute dating provided by our fission 
track method. As a further test, we 
have analyzed the fluorine content 
of the skull and found it almost 
identical to that of the piece of jaw- 
bone we had found earlier. Though 
the Jaw didn’t belong to this same 
skull, the- two are about the same 
age. The greater the length of time 
bones remain in groundwater laden 
with fluorine ions, the higher the 
percentage of fluorine in the fos- 
sil.” 

“Professor,” Liz said, “how 
large a brain did this early human 
have?” 

“The cranial cavity of this 
specimen indicates ... ah, here’s 
Winters with the thing now.” 

A young man came up to the 
desk holding something that looked 
like a brown sfone. 

“Hello, Miss Devlin.” “I under- 
stood you’re from the press.” 

“Hello,” Liz said. 

“Put the skull there,” Eastlake 
said, pointing to a clearing he had 
made on the desk. 

“The cranial cavity of this 
specimen indicates that its brain 
must have weighed about 1500 
grams. The average weight for a 
modern human brain is about 
1400.” 

“Does that mean this creature 
was more intelligent than we are?” 
Liz asked. 

“Not necessarily. Both the 
largest and the smallest human 
brains ever measured belonged to 
idiots.” 



“It looks human,” Liz said. 

“I firmly believe it was human,” 
Eastlake said. He picked up the 
skull and contemplated it. Hamlet- 
like. 

“But what happened to these 
people?” Liz asked. 

“Again, I cannot answer that 
yet,” the old man said with a pro- 
fessorial tone of voice. There just 
isn’t enough evidence. However, 
off the record — ” 

Liz turned off the machine. 

“Off the record,” he continued, 
“I can give you some personal 
thoughts of my own.” 

“Please,” Liz said. 

Despite our similarity, I don’t be- 
lieve we have descended from these 
creatures. Evolution probably was 
only parallel.” 

“\\Tiat do you mean?” 

“We seem to have evolved from 
Australopithecus, a small, vaguely 
human creature that evolved via 
old-world monkeys from certain 
prosimians at a time when they 
were about mid-way in their de- 
velopment. This was about forty 
million years ago. Prior to our dis- 
covery here, the earliest near-human 
remains known dated from about 
three million years ago. Now, pro- 
simians first appeared a full 136 
million years ago. So, the time span 
from the point where prosimian be- 
came ape-like and the point where 
we humans are now is about forty 
million years. If, for some reason, a 
variety of yet- undiscovered proto- 
ape branched off from the prosi- 



24 



GALAXY 




mians at the beginning of their 
development — as well as in the 
middle — our earliest human here 
would have had no less than sixty 
million years to evolve into what he 
was. That’s twenty million more 
than we had.” 

Professor,” Liz asked, ‘‘could 
the memory of this earlier race be 
preserved in certain myths?” 

“You mean the Atlantis myth?” 

“And others like it — the Golden 
Age myths, the Garden of Eden. 
Variants of it are found all over the 
world.” 

“Improbable. The time span is 
much too great.” 

“But if some of this race did 
somehow survive whatever catas- 
tophe seems to have happened to 
them, they might have evolved into 
present man. And we might have 
retained some racial memory of 
them.” 

“So far, no conclusive evidence 
for racial memory has ever been 
produced.” 

Liz nodded. 

“In fact, if you’re going to 
speculate that wildly,” Eastake con- 
tinued, “You’ve got to consider ab- 
solutely all logical possibilities — 
including the possibility that these 
creatures had an extra-terrestrial 
origin.”

Night had come to the sea. 

The shallows of the reef were 
now as black as the endless night of 

THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA 



the abyssal plains that stretched out 
below them. Liz stood by a 
curved-glass window in the main 
dome and watched the alien-looking 
sea grass wave slowly back and 
forth in the glow of the underwater 
lamps. Suddenly, behind her, the 
blast of a trumpet dynamited the si- 
lence. 

“God, don’t you hate rainy 
days?” Don said, fingering the val- 
ves on the trumpet. “What we need 
is music.” 

“Don,” Liz said calmly, “has 
anyone every told you you need 
help?” 

“No,” Don said drunkenly, “just 
music.” 

“Maybe a vacation.” 

“Liz, want to know a secret? 1 
like working here more than any of 
these . these zombies you see 
walking around in white coats. I get 
more of a kick out of it. I’ll tell you 
that. Yessir.” 

“I don’t believe that, Don,” she 
said. 

“They don’t have fun with it. I 
do.” 

“Oh?” 

“Anyway, who are you to be 
telling me what I like and don’t 
like? EVERYBODY IN THE 
POOL!” 

“Don—” 

He held the trumpet to his lips. 

BLA-A-A-A-A-A-T. 

•k * ir 

Only one technician, a young In- 

25 




dian man, remained in the lab, the 
rest having apparently gone to din- 
ner. He stood by a large device that 
looked like a huge magnet wound 
with about a million turns of wire. 
A quiverying waveform shifted on 
the screen of an oscilloscope on the 
bench. 

Liz approached him quietly from 
behind. 

“Hi,” she said suddenly. 

“Oh!” the young man 
exclaimed. “You startled me.” 
“Sorry.” 

“That’s okay.” 

“My name’s Liz Devlin. New 
World News.” 

“Yes,” the man said, “I saw 
you earlier, taking pictures.” 
“Right. Say — may 1 ask you 
what you’re doing?” 

“Uh, why?” he asked. 

“Well, I’m interested in every- 
thing thats going on down here, but 
I don’t know about science. Could 
you tell me what this instrument 
does? What’s that thing in the mag- 
net there, or whatever it is?” 

“I don’t know how much I’m al- 
lowed to tell you,” the technician 
said. 

“Don’t worry,” Liz told him. 
“Professor Eastlake gave me com- 
plete clearance. You can check with 
him if you like.” 

“No, I believe you,” he said. 
“By the way, what’s your name? 
I’ll need it for my article.” 
“Govindrapali,” he said. 

“How do you spell that?” She 
pretended to write the name down 
26 



in her notebook as he spelled it for 
her. 

“Now, what exactly does this 
complicated-looking machine do?” 
she asked in her most naive tone of 
voice. “It must be very hard to use 
all these intricate devices.” 

“It’s a magnetmeter,” he ex- 
plained, pointing to the massive in- 
strument. “I’m analyzing a piece of 
brick that was found at the site.” 
“Oh, yes,” Liz said, “I heard 
about it.” 

“Well, you see, when clay is 
ftred in a kiln, it acquires what we 
call remnant magnetism. The parti- 
cles of iron in the clay become 
magnetized by the earth’s magnetic 
field where the clay is fired. This 
machine measures the inclination 
and declination of the particles in 
the artifact.” 

“Really, and what does all that 
mean?” 

“Well, we have records of the 
inclination and declination of the 
earth’s field all over the planet, and 
of how it changed through time. We 
got those by analyzing core samples 
with this same machine. That way 
we can tell exactly where on the 
earth a particular piece of clay was 
fired.” 

“And have you found out where 
these bricks were fired?” 

“Um, yes,” the technician said. 
“And that is a very curious thing.” 
“What do you mean?” 

“Unless our measurements are 
wrong, this brick must have been 
made about where the continent of 



GALAXY 




Asia is now. Even allowing for the 
drift of the continents, that would 
mean this brick was made far away 
from where it was found.” 

“And yet it’s just as old as the 
other artifacts?” 

‘‘Oh, yes.” 

Liz looked at him. 

‘‘But that would mean that this 
isn’t the only place where this early 
man lived.” 

The technician nodded nervously. 
‘‘Yes, yes, that would certainly 
seem to be the case.” 

* * * 

Sitting at his desk Professor 
Eastlake was almost hidden by a 
still-growing stack of print-outs and 
progress reports. He was holding 
the phone with one hand, a 
chicken-salad-and kelp sandwich 
with the other. 

‘‘More bones?” he asked with his 
mouth full. ‘‘Good. Don’t forget to 
remind each diver to tag them with 
labels. 1 want the exact grid loca- 
tion written in waterproof ink on 
every fragment, every chip of pot- 
tery, every nut and bolt they dig out 
of the ground. Yes, that’s right; if 
it’s too small to tag, use the plastic 
vials. And this time have them in- 
clude some soil samples with every 
find, in case the salt water washes 
off the datable material.” 

In preparation for this session, 
Liz was flipping through the stack 
of note cards she had accumulated 
during her five days at the Center.

Eastlake put down the phone and 
rubbed his eyes. 

“Professor,” she said, “You 
can’t have had more than ten hours 
sleep the last three days.” 

“Can’t be helped,” he said. 
‘‘Now, what can 1 do for you?” 

“I’d like to know if any new 
evidence has turned up.” 

“No,” the old man said, “not 
yet.” 

“But 1 heard that those bricks 
that were uncovered weren’t made 
in this location.” 

Eastlake looked at her for a mo- 
ment, startled. 

“Oh, yes, that,” he said. “Actu- 
ally, 1 was going to get around to 

27 



telling you about that later today, 
when more pieces were fitted into 
the puzzle. I hate being prema- 
ture.” 

‘‘Of course.” 

‘‘Who told you that, by the 
way?” 

“What?” ’ 

“About the bricks?” 

“I don’t know his name,” Liz 
lied. 

“Oh, well, it’s very simple. They 
were fired somewhere in what is 
now Asia.” 

“That means that there were 
others — maybe all over the world.” 
“We can’t say that,” Eastlake 
said cautiously. “They may have 
been just an isolated colony. In any 
case, it does seem that our earliest 
man — let’s call him archaeo- 
homo — did do a bit of travelling in 
the late Cretaceous.” 

“Were these bricks part of the 
foundation of a building?” 

“Maybe not a foundation. Prob- 
ably part of a building, though.” 
“Professor, if these people had 
the means of travel why didn’t they 
just move to another area instead of 
dying out as they apparently did?” 
“Impossible to say now,” the 
Professor said. “There may have 
been no other suitable areas for var- 
ious reasons, or it could be that by 
the time it became necessary for 
them to migrate they had lost what- 
ever technology they had had. Also, 
don’t forget; the more complex a 
society is, the harder it is to move 
it. People living in tents or caves 

28 



have no trouble being nomadic. 
Think how hard it would be to 
move any modern urban capital. 
The truth is, we may never know 
exactly what happened to them.” 

“What else have you found 
out?” 

“We know that the climate of 
this area was then mild. The tem- 
perature of the sea averaged about 
seventy degrees.” 

“Professor, how in God’s name 
can you know that?” 

“Again, by a method perfected 
back in the sixties — oxygen isotope 
analysis. You see, in sea water we 
have measurable quantities of two 
kinds of oxygen isotope — 0i6 and 
0i8. 0i8, being heavier, naturally 
doesn’t evaporate as fast as the Oie 
for any given temperature. By 
measuring the ratio of 0i8 and Oie 
left in fossil shells, we can deter- 
mine within a few degrees what the 
ancient temperature of the sea in 
which they formed was. It’s a lot 
easier to explain than it is to do, but 
the procedure is very reliable.” 

Liz was busily taking notes. 

“Furthermore,’’ he continued, 
“we know that, ecologically, this 
area was similar to what it is now. 
We have been extremely lucky in 
finding some fossil pollen — enough 
to do a rough sort of statistical 
analysis. We know that approxi- 
mately a third of the surrounding 
land area was covered with various 
kinds of conifers. About a third was 
covered with a variety of grains. 
Most of the traces are unrecogniz- 



GALAXY 




able, but at least one looks like a 
forerunner of modem barley. It’s a 
good guess that they practised some 
cultivation, although, judging from 
the bone remains in their middens, 
their main diet seems to have been 
fish. The other third of the land 
must have been bare rock or de- 
ciduous trees.” 

‘‘And they knew how to make 
steel.” 

“Yes,” Eastlake said, “and that 
means they had some source of high 
energy.” 

“Coal?” 

“No, too early. What it could 
have been we have yet to deter- 
mine; we’ve uncovered no lead de- 
posits that would suggest ancient 
uranium usage. We just don’t 
know.” 

* * * 

Liz set her tray down beside a 
young woman wearing a white uni- 
form. The cafeteria was noisy; 
sound seemed to reflect off the curved 
ceiling and focus in the center of 
the room, amplifying background 
conversation into a roar. 

“Hi,” she said to the woman. 
“Mind if I sit here?” 

“No, go ahead.” 

“I see you’re a nurse,” Liz said, 
sitting down beside her. 

“Yes. I work in the clinic. 
You’re that reporter, aren’t you?” 
Liz nodded. 

“Liz Devlin.” 

“I’m Anne Sloane.” 

THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA 



Liz opened the container of 
yogurt she had chosen for lunch and 
began to stir it. 

“It’s synthetic,” Anne said. 

“The yogurt?” 

“They make all the food here, 
from algae.” 

“I see.” 

“It’s not bad, though.” 

“Anne, what’s it like working 
here?” Liz asked informally. “Does 
the clinic handle a lot of cases? Are 
there many accidents?” 

“No,” the woman said, sipping 
what looked like lemonade. “Once 
in a while a diver will need decom- 
pression. Most of them are ar- 
chaeologists, you know. Some 
hadn’t had a lot of diving experi- 
ence before they started to work on 
the project. Now and then one of 
them gets the bends.” 

“How do you like living down 
here?” 

“I sort of like it,” she said. “1 
don’t think I’d like to spend the rest 
of my life here, but for a while it’s 
okay.” 

“What don’t you like about it?” 

“Oh, 1 don’t know,” Anne 
shrugged. “I guess I miss the 
movies most of all. They show 
movies here but most of them are 
pretty old. It’s kind of like a 
summer camp, you know? Did you 
ever go to one of those when you 
were a kid?” 

“But there’s TV here,” Liz said. 

“Oh, sure. But I like going out, 
you know what I mean? Another 
thing is — I know this isn’t really 

29 




important — but people down here 
are pretty dull. They don’t like 
going to parties much or anything. 
Except Don.” 

“Don Cams?” 

“Yeah, I like Don.” 

Liz looked at her. 

“Nothing, -you know, romantic or 
anything,” Anne added quickly. 
“He’s just fun to be with. In fact, 
he’s the only person down here 1 
can have a good time with.” 
“Really?” 

“Yeah. The others . they al- 
ways seem to be thinking about 
something. There’s always some- 
thing on their minds. You know 
what I mean?” 

Liz nodded. 

“Don and Professor Eastlake 
seem to argue a lot,” Liz added, 
watching Anne’s eyes carefully for 
a reaction. 

“Oh, yes, it’s terrible,” Anne 
said with genuine concern. “It 
makes us all feel very uncomfort- 
able sometimes.” 

“Does Don have a bad temper?” 
“I guess both of them do. 
They’re both very smart.” 

“1 see.” 

“I respect Professor Eastlake a 
lot,” Anne continued, “but 
he’s . he’s — ” 

“Stuffy?” Liz said. 

“Yes,” Anne nodded. “He’s al- 
ways calling Don a Do-Nothing.” 
“Is he?” 

“Maybe,” she said. “But then, 
he’s here, isn’t he? That means 
something. And they say there’s not 

30 



much that can be done to save 
things anyway, you know. That’s a 
fact. I guess I’m sort of a Do- 
Nothing myself; I want to have a 
good time while I can.” 

It -k it 

“They like Bach most of all,” 
Don said. “Must be because his 
sound patterns are the most compli- 
cated of any of the composers I 
have on tape.” He pulled another 
casette out of the rack and placed it 
on the player. 

“You think they enjoy it?” Liz 
asked. “Or do they just think it’s 
the sonar of some other animal?’ ’ 

“J.S. Bach’s sonar,” he said. 
“And there’s no doubt about it; 
they enjoy it. Porpoises are the 
most fun-loving animals on the face 
of the earth. Look at them out 
there. They haven’t a care in the 
world.” 

Liz looked out the curved win- 
dow of the lounge. A school of 
porpoises was performing a sort of 
boisterous ballet in the flickering 
light of the water. Now and then 
one of them would glide over to the 
underwater speaker mounted outside 
the window and float there motion- 
less for a few moments, as though 
listening to the music. 

“When I mounted the sonar unit 
out there,” Don said, “I did it out 
of boredom. I didn’t know if any- 
thing would happen or not. But it 
was a real success. Not only did I 
learn that porpoises like music, I 

GALAXY 





found out that some show a prefer- 
ence for different composers.” 

Liz looked at her watch. 

“Maybe I’d better get back to the 
lab,” she said. “Something new 
may have turned up.” 

“Relax,” Don said. It’ll wait 
for you. You know, you could take 
a few lessons on relaxation from 
these dolphins.” 

Liz sat back in her chair. The 
dolphin outside seemed to be watch- 
ing her. 

“What range of notes can they 
hear, anyway?” 

■“They can hear tones between 75 
Hz and 150 KHz, while we can 
hear frequencies from 20 Hz to 
about 20 KHz. Their hearing is 
most acute well beyond our range. 



That’s one rea.son why attempts to 
communicate with them have been 
so frustrating.” 

“You don’t still believe that they 
have a language, do you?” 

Don looked out the window in si- 
lence, smiling faintly. 

“Maybe they don’t have a lan- 
guage,” he said finally. “Maybe 
they don’t need one.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Look at it this way: would we 
need a language if we could read 
each other’s minds?” 

Liz laughed out loud. 

“Now you’re telling me por- 
poises are telepathic?” 

“Sonar,” Don said seriously. 
“These creatures live in a world of 
sound. They hear with their bodies. 



THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA 



31 



and can emit clicks and chirps of 
sonar anywhere from ten to one- 
hundred millionths of a second in 
duration and up to six hundred of 
these pulses a second. This sense of 
theirs is so highly developed that 
they can distinguish between steel 
balls two and one-eighth and two 
and one-half inches in diameter, and 
between copper and alutninum disks 
of exactly the same size. In fact, 
their sonar is better than the sort of 
medical sonar equipmenf we use to 
locate tumors and stoppages of 
blood flow.” 

“In other words, you’re telling 
me they know when one of them is 
sick?” 

“Certainly,” Don said. “And us 
too. Human flesh has basically the 
same density as sea water. But the 
lungs, the bones, the blood vessels 
reflect sound pulses differently. In 
the water, we probably look like 
X-ray images of ourselves to por- 
poises.” 

“Yeah, but they still can’t com- 
municate abstract ideas.” 

“They can tell when someone is 
happy or upset, by changes in heart 
rate and respiration.” 

“Don, I repeat: they still can’t 
fully communicate.” 

“Maybe they’ve evolved beyond 
that,” Don said. “Their lives are 
pure play. They’re happy. Can we 
say the same?” 

Liz drummed her fingers on the 
tape recorder she held on her lap. 
Suddenly she felt uneasy about the 
creatures that played beyond the 

32 



window. It was as though they had 
begun to pose some vague threat to 
her. 

“No, I won’t believe that,” she 
said. 

“Won’t believe what?” 

“I’m not about to believe that 
those porpoises out there are more 
advanced than we are. That’s ab- 
surd. If they were really intelligent, 
they’d have built cities. They’d 
have a culture, a literature.” 

“Spoken like a New Yorker,” 
Don laughed. “Liz, what would 
they need with cities?” 

“Well, er — ” 

“They have no overcrowding, no 
smog, no poisonous air, no pollu- 
tion, no unemployment, no murder. 
They’re perfectly in tune with their 
environment. Cities for them would 
be a step down.” 

Liz said nothing. 

“What the hell,” Don said in a 
strangely different tone of voice. 
“What am I going on like this for? 
You may be right; it’s all just words 
anyway. Hey, how about a game of 
Risk? I’ve programmed the com- 
puter for a three-player game.” 

“I don’t think so, Don,’’ she 
said. “I’ve got a lot of work to 
do.” 

“So do I, but that can wait. 
Come on. Just one game.” 

* * * 

The three of them floated over a 
landscape that looked strangely 
alien with its ledges of coral and 



GALAXY 




blossoms of anemone and star- fish. 
Liz had the sensation of flying as 
the humming engine of the mini-sub 
propelled them through the sea. 
Below them divers flippered over 
the excavation site, collecting more 
samples from the yawning trenches. 
A few porpoises swam around them 
as they worked, darting in and out 
of the silver bubbles that shimmered 
above their scuba tanks, as though 
the creatures wanted the bubbles to 
tickle their underbellies. One of 
them swam up to the sub, peered in 
the window for a moment and then 
darted off. 

“They always look like they’re 
smiling,’’ Liz said. “Don’t you 
think so?” 

Eastlake steered the sub over the 
last trench and said nothing. Don 
sat in the third seat with his feet 
propped up on the dashboard, and 
watched the porpoise swim over to 
its companions. 

“Professor,” Liz said to break 
the uncomfortable silence between 
the two men, “in the two weeks 
that I’ve been here. I’ve seen and 
heard a lot of things that strain be- 
lievability. 1 think I should tell you 
that, although 1 believe you, some 
of the other news services are al- 
ready calling you a charlatan.” 

Eastlake shrugged. 

“Professor,” she continued, “I’d 
like to do as much as I can to make 
the importance of your discovery 
reach even the most skeptical of 
people. But, frankly, I can’t do this 
if you don’t tell me everything.” 

THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA 



“What do you mean?’,’ Eastlake 
said. 

“I mean that you haven’t been 
very honest with me„” she said 
cooly. 

Eastlake looked fiercely at Don. 

“Cams, what have you told 
her?” 

“Nothing,” Don replied. 

“So help me,” the Professor 
threatened, “I don’t care if we have 
to reprogram every operation in the 
Center; I’ll have you fired for this!” 

“Don didn’t tell me anything,” 
Liz said. “That was just a guess — a 
hunch I had. From the very begin- 
ning I’ve had the feeling that you 
two were keeping something from 
me. You’ve been fighting each 
other non-stop, Don’s been making 
vague comments about your keeping 
things from the media — ” 

“Don’s an irresponsible fool,” 
Eastlake said, looking straight 
ahead. “He’s just out to sen- 
sationalize the truth for the sake of 
causing an uproar. It’s just another 
of his adolescent pranks.” 

“You always did feel insecure 
about having me around,” Don said 
caustically. “What’s the problem, 
Eastlake — the fact that my brain has 
the Von Aachen lobe and your 
doesn’t? The fact that I’m further 
evolved?” 

“All the evidence isn’t in on that 
yet, Carus,” the Professor snapped. 
“For all anyone knows for sure, 
that may just be brain damage.” 

“Bullshit.” 

“You’re a clown. Cams. You’re 

33 




no better than one of those Do- 
Nothings on land. What’s worse, 
you’re down here among serious, 
dedicated people.” 

“Who will continue to screw up 
the plaaet because they are so god- 
dainMd serious and dedicated. Be- 
cause they can’t let well enough 
alone — ” 

“Oentlemen!’’ Liz exclaimed. 
“You can fight with each other 
after I leave. Right now, 1 need 
some answers. Professor, why did 
you caH me down here if you didn’t 
wsrnt me to learn the truth? Did you 
just want me to get a good picture 
of you for the papers?” 

“Way to go, Liz.” 

“Quiet, Dcm.” 

“No,” Eastlake said, “that’s not 
true.” 

“Tell her, Eastlake,” Don said 
calmly. “Tell her what really hap- 
pened to that ancient race of man.” 
“Cams, so help me — ” 

“Go on. Professor. If you don’t, 
I will. Humanity will adjust to the 
news. They’re more resilient than 
you think. You never did give the 
average person credit for an ounce 
of intelligence.” 

“What news?” Liz demanded. 
“What became of them?” 

“Those people,” Don said, 
“didn’t just die out all of a sudden. 
There was no plague, no sudden 
sinking of their continent. They 
changed. They evolved, naturally. 
Think of it, Liz: modem man de- 
veloped from little fuzzy prosimians 
that looked like over-sized squirrels, 

34 



in about thirty million years. These 
fully-developped human beings ex- 
isted over sixty million years ago. If 
they still existed, chances are they’d 
look very different from what they 
once did. They’d have evolved.” 
“Then you’re saying they’re still 
here?” Liz asked. 

“They’re right out there,” Don 
said. “See them — swimming beside 
die sub?” 

"Poqioises?” Liz said breathless- 
ly. “You mean — ” 

“Don is right,” the Professor 
said, “For a long time it’s been 
known that porpoises and whales 
evolved from some land mammal 
diat for some reason took to the sea 
about fifty to sixty million years 
ago. Nobody was really sure what 
that mammal was until now.” 
“Liz,” Don added, “we’ve 
found skeletal remains you haven’t 
seen — remains that span many cen- 
turies and show the change from 
land to sea mammal.” 

“I knew it! I knew you weren’t 
showing me all you found!” 

“And that is the real story be- 
hind Jonah,” Don said. “Haven’t 
you ever wondered why their brains 
are so similar to ours?” 

“When their continent sank,” 
Liz said slowly, “they took to the 
water.” 

“Just as we are doing now,” 
Don said, “for different reasons.” 
“That’s what’s so disturbing 
about our discovery,” Eastlake 
said. “That’s the big news we have 
for humanity.” 



GALAXY 




The sub broke the surface. 



* # -* 

The yellow sky burst in on them 
through the foam. They bobbed for 
a while near the hexagonal dock as 
a cruiser approached them from 
land. It was travelling very fast. 

“That would be my boat now,” 
Liz said dazedly. “Look how funny 
the sky looks . it’s so yel- 
low ...” 

“Liz,” Eastlake said earnestly, 
“the news that we weren’t first on 
the planet will shock a lot of 
people. Prepare them for it.” 

“Professor,” Liz said, “tell me 
one last thing: is this going to hap- 
pen to us too?” 

“Probably not. But then no one 
can know for sure.” 

“Liz,” Don interrupted, “it 
won’t be such a bad thing. Eastlake 
here just can’t stand the idea of 
change. It’s evolution; when we be- 
come like them, nature will have 
corrected itself, restored things to 
balance again.” 

Someone was yelling from the 
cruiser. 

Don opened the hatch, and the 
three of them climbed out on the 
dock. 

“Liz,” the man said breathlessly, 
“quick. Get aboard. We’ve got to 
get to the airport before the shock 
wave hits.” 

“What?” she said blankly. 

“War? We’ve been so busy, 
I—” 



“Come on, quick. I’m sorry, you 
two, but I’m only authorized to take 
Miss Devlin.” 

“We can take care of ourselves,” 
Don said. “Liz, I’ll get your 
bags.” 

“Can it be?” Eastlake whispered. 
“After all this time. ...” 

“The sky,” Liz said, looking 
up. “That’s why it looks so 
strange.” 

“Liz, hurry,” the man said. “A 
jet is waiting for us on the main is- 
land.” 

Don returned with her luggage 
and threw it over the side of the 
cruiser while Liz climbed the ladder 
from the dock. 

“Don,” Eastlake said, “we’ve 
got to get back down and help the 
others.” 

“Professor, Don,” Li-” ailed 
from the boat, “I want t>. ;ome 
back. I want to know all you find 
out.” 

Don waved good-bye and nod- 
ded. It was the kind of nod he used 
to give Eastlake when he wasn’t lis- 
tening to a word the old man was 
saying. 

The air was hot and humid. 

Over the distant land a trail of 
black smoke smudged the sky. 

The sun burned red above the 
horizon. 

Liz watched the small sub disap- 
pear underwater. Near the ring of 
bubbles it left, a porpoise suddenly 
leaped playfully into the air and 
slapped its tail on the surface of the 
bloc^-waim sea. ★ 



THEY WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA 



35 




The year is 1936. The world is 
just recovering from the Great De- 
pression. New technological mira- 
cles are blossoming. The newspa- 
pers contain stories of telephone 
calls across the country, airplane 
flights across the Atlantic, and that 
new rich-man' s toy, television . 
Newspaper stories of Dr. Goddard’s 
historic first rocket flight of 10 
years ago are almost forgotten . 
Suppose that in 1936^ — 40 years ago 
— someone had proposed a pro- 
gram for interplanetary exploration. 
This preposterous program would 
have had an initial goal of sending 
an automated probe to the moon 
within 25 years, followed by the 
landing of a man on the moon 
within 50 years. This program 
would plan to use advanced 
aircraft-construction techniques to 
produce rockets as tall as buildings, 
containing hundreds of tons of liquid 
hydrogen and liquid oxygen as 
fuel — but only three passengers. 
These incredibly expensive vehicles 
would only be used — once! — the 
various parts being dropped into the 
ocean, or left in orbit, or left on the 
moon. To carry out this flight the 
power generated by the rocket en- 
gines during launch would have to 
exceed the total installed electrical 
generation capability of the U. S. in 
1936 (20,000 MW). The program- 
cost over the 50-year period would 
exceed the Federal appropriations 
for 1936 ($8 B). Yet ^e proposer 
would have the audacity to say that 
all this was possible with only pre- 



dictable 10-30 year projections of 
1936 technology. 

I doubt that anyone in 1936 
would have supported such an idea. 
“A man on the Moon in 50 
years!! — Impossible!! — That is noth- 
ing but ridiculous science 
fiction!!— We have more important 
things to spend our money on!! 
After all, the unemployment rate is 
5%!” 

But, as we all know, that was 
exactly the way it happened. It hap- 
pened because it was technologi- 
cally possible and politically 
needed, first by the Russians (to 
prove they were better than the 
Americans^ then by the Americans 
(to prove — “No you aren’t”). But 
it did not take 50 years for this 
science-fiction fantasy to become a 
reality; the first man stepped on the 
Moon on 20 July 1969, Just 33 
years from 1936. 

It is now 1976. The newspapers 
contain stories about men exploring 
the moon, automated probes landing 
on Mars, spacecraft swinging by 
Jupiter with enough energy to go 
sailing off into interstellar space — 
never to return to the solar system. 

It is time to start planning for In- 
terstellar Exploration to turn today’s 
science fiction into the realities of 
the future. Our developing 
capabilities in controlling fusion, 
beaming laser energy, tailoring new 
structural materials, and increasing 
the intelligence of computers while 
reducing their size, weight and cost, 
will make interstellar exploration of 

37 



INTERSTELLAR PROBES AND STAR SHIPS 




the nearby stars technologically 
feasible. All that will be required 
to focus this technology on interstel- 
lar exploration will be the political 
need, and that political need will 
come. 

For the same political reasons 
that they launched SPUTNIK, the 
Russians have already launched 
their version of the SETl program 
to search for messages from in- 
terstellar cultures. One day — -not too 
long from now — they will launch 
their first interstellar probe. Will we 
be ready? — or will we again have to 
be asked by the politicians to start a 
crash project to catch up? 

\ 

FEASIBILITY OF 
INTERSTELLAR EXPLORATION 

Going to the, stars is not easy — 
but it is not impossible either. To 
travel to the stars will take years of 
time, gigawatts of power, kilograms 
of energy, and billions (if not tril- 
lions) of dollars. Yet it can be 
done — if we wish to. 

We don’t have to wait centuries 
for the development of some exotic 
new propulsion concept like anti- 
gravity or space warps so we can go 
hopping around the Galaxy. There 
is a lot we can do here and now 
with reasonable extrapolations of 
our present day technology that will 
suffice for centuries of interstellar 
exploration. Within 20 light years 
of the sun there are 59 stellar sys- 
tems containing 81 visible stars and 

38 



an estimated 500 planets. To 
explore these nearby planets we do 
not need to insist on 10 year round- 
trip times to accomodate fragile 
man; one-way trip times of 20 to 50 
years using semi-intelligent probes 
will do. We do not need propulsion 
systems that accelerate to the speed 
of light; maximum velocities of a 
few tenths of the speed of light will 
do. We do not need the 100% mass 
conversion of matter-antimatter 
gamma ray photon engines; the 
0.4% mass conversion of fusion 
will do. 

Now, there are people who might 
admit the physical feasibility of in- 
terstellar exploration of the nearer 
stars, but who question the desira- 
bility of such a program when we 
can gain information about other in- 
terstellar civilizations more cheaply 
and more rapidly by listening with 
the special search arrays and signal 
processing equipment that are plan- 
ned for the SETI program. I agree, 
that if there is someone at the other 
end who is sending information, 
then SETI will make a significant 
contribution to our knowledge. 
However, there may be many civili- 
zations on those 500 planets near us 
that we cannot learn about by 
means of SETL Some obvious 
examples are: civilizations on water- 
covered planets that never de- 
veloped a metals technology; intel- 
ligent beings floating in the atmo- 
spheres of Jupiter-like planets; an- 
cient cultures that are now extinct, 
but which left rich treasures for an 



GALAXY 




astro-archaeologist; besides which 
there must be other no'n-radio cul- 
tures that we cannot even begin to 
imagine now. 

In my view, interstellar explora- 
tion with automated probes is com- 
plementary to the SETI program, 
rather than competitive with it. 



INTERSTELLAR PROBE DESIGN 

The design of the probe is the 
critical element in any program for 
interstellar exploration. The rigors 
and length of a journey involving 
high accelerations with high energy 
density engines, the years of bom- 
bardment against interstellar matter 
at high relative velocities, and the 
decades of operation with no means 
for repair, or even diagnostic help 
from earth, means that a new level 
of self-diagnostic, self-repairing, 
multiply-redundant probe design 
must be developed. 

Ultimately, the computer in the 
probe will have to exhibit semi- 
intelUgent behavior when presented 
with new and unforseen circum- 
stances. 

The requirement for multiple 
planetary exploration at each stellar 
system will limit the number and 
weight of lander probes available, 
and puts a premium on long-range 
sensor capabilities to gather the 
same data from orbit. These, in 
turn, require very high resolution 
capability from orbital altitudes, 
which drives up the size of the 



transmitting and collecting apertures 
desired. 

Yet despite these needs for per- 
formance the energy requirements 
for achieving flight velocities ap- 
proaching that of light are so large 
that the weight of the probe should 
be kept to a minimum. Develop- 
ment efforts on multiple frequency 
transmitters, antennas, sensors and 
data processors are needed to mini- 
mize the payload. 

What we desire in an interstellar 
probe is a large physical size (to 
give the transmitting and receiving 
apertures desired), and high power 
(for active sounders and data trans- 
mission), all combined with light 
weight. 

I would like to see the designers 
get a goal of 100 kg for the weight 
of an interstellar probe. The design 
of such a probe is a challenge — but 
an important one; for the weight of 
the probe determines the sizes of 
the propulsion system. 

INTERSTELLAR 
PROPULSION CONCEPTS 

There are not one, but many pos- 
sible techniques for interstellar 
propulsion that have received 
enough study so that we know that 
they have the basic energy and 
power capacity to be considered for 
interstellar propulsion. All of them 
still retain a number of technical 
uncertainties and will require signif- 
icant engineering effort before they 



INTERSTELLAR PROBES AND STAR SHIPS 



39 




can be said to be engineeringly feasi- 
ble. Here are four of them. 

1. Nuclear Pulse Propulsion. This 
is the old Orion concept. The pro- 
pulsion system operates by jettison- 
ing a small nuclear bomb out the 
back, exploding it, and absorbing 
part of the momentum of the result- 
ing plasma cloud on an ablation 
plate mounted on shock absorbers. 
A study of a design for an interstel- 
lar version was carried out by 
Freeman Dyson. It had a very large 
payload, 45,000 tons (enough for a 
small human community) and a 
supply of 300,000 bombs that 
weighed six times the payload. The 
bombs are exploded once per sec- 
ond, resulting in a one-g accelera- 
tion for 10 days, or a final velocity 
of three percent of the velocity of 
light. This velocity would get the 
ship to Alpha Centauri in 130 years. 
The Dyson design is marginal for 
interstellar exploration, but has the 
important feature that it uses proven 
technology. The recent British In- 
terplanetary Society Project Daed- 
alus study designed a newer and 
higher-speed version of an interstellar 
nuclear-pulse jet that used micropel- 
lets of fusionable material ignited 250 
times per second by lasers or relativis- 
tic electron beams. 

2. Controlled Fusion Rocket. We 
are at present not certain which of 
the many proposed techniques for 
controlled nuclear fusion will prove 
feasible, but whatever method re- 



sults, it will be a prime candidate 
for the propulsion portion of an in- 
terstellar exploration mission. Most 
of the present effort in fusion re- 
search is concentrated on the de- 
velopment of leakproof magnetic 
bottles. Fortunately, for the propul- 
sion application, what is desired is a 
leaky magnetic bottle, the leak of 
hot plasma being the reaction jet. 
However, because of the low 0.4% 
energy conversion efficiency of the 
fusion reaction, interstellar explora- 
tion with fusion rockets will require 
massive vehicles with large mass 
ratios. 

3. Interstellar Ramjet. No matter 
how good one can make the Orion 
or Fusion rocket concepts, they are 
still forced to carry their fuel along 
with them. The interstellar ramjet 
instead uses a large magnetic scoop 
to collect interstellar hydrogen to 
fuel its fusion rockets, thus 
eliminating the need to carry fuel. 
Studies have shown that the ramjet 
takeover velocity is extremely low, 
so that conventional rockets could 
provide the initial acceleration. A 
large vehicle with a frontal intake 
radius of 300 km could achieve a 
one-g acceleration through interstel- 
lar space with a nucleon density of 
1 to 1000 nucleons/cc. There have 
been many studies of this concept, 
including a recent one that recom- 
mended carrying along a carbon 
catalyst to overcome the low cross 
section of the proton-proton reac- 
tion. 



40 



GALAXY 




4. Beamed-Power Laser Propulsion. 
Although the Ramjet does not have 
to carry its fuel, it does have to 
carry and maintain an engine. The 
beamed-power laser system does not 
have to carry either fuel or an en- 
gine. The spacecraft would be in 
the form of a large solar sail, many 
kilometers across. A large laser on 
the earth or in orbit around the sun 
would send a beam of laser light to 
push the spacecraft. For many 
years, this concept did not receive 
much attention, for it was thought 
to be limited to flyby missions, 
since there would be no laser at the 
target star to decelerate the space- 
craft. However, if after the space- 
craft is up to speed it lets out a long 
wire to increase its self-capacitance 
and then uses radioactive materials 
to develop and maintain a charge, it 
will interact with the interstellar 
magnetic field through the Lorentz 
force and will swing around in a 
large circle. If the mission is planned 
correctly, the spacecraft will arc 
around behind the target star and be 
coming by the star with its velocity 
vector pointing at earth. We then 
turn on the laser again and deceler- 
ate the spacecraft at the target star. 
To carry out a rendezvous mission 
with the beamed power laser system 
would require a laser array 250 km 
across, so that the laser beam will 
not diverge significantly at the 
6-to-lO lightyear distance required 
to decelerate the probe. Although 
the laser array must be large in 
area, the array does not need to be

There are other, newer concepts 
that have not received as much 
study, but which look very promis- 
ing. One uses beamed laser energy 
from earth to energize reaction mass 
carried on the ship. The other uses 
a small amopnt of anti-matter (about 
2%) to energize a much larger 
amount of regular matter. 

Arthur Clarke (one of the earliest 
members of the British Interplanet- 
ary Society) said in his book The 
Promise of Space: 

“With so many theoretical pos- 
sibilities for interstellar flight, we 
can be sure that at least one will 
be realized in practice. Remember 
the history of the atomic bomb; 
there were three different ways in 
which it could be made, and no 
one knew which was best. So they 
were all tried — and they all 
worked.” 



JOURNEY WITH AN 
INTERSTELLAR PROBE 

In 1998, an interstellar probe, 
which has been waiting in space in 
the region beyond the moon, 
launches itself toward the triple star 
system Alpha Centauri. It thrusts at 
high acceleration, its engines run- 
ning at a power level that is ten 
times the power of a Saturn V 
rocket. The exhaust of hot hydrogen 
plasma glows like a bright star, vis- 
ible both night and day. 

After four months the probe has 

42 



left the solar system, and has 
reached 1/3 the velocity of light. It 
begins its long drift through in- 
terstellar space using its bulky first 
stage shell as a radiation barrier to 
protect it from the constant rain of 
high energy particles^ produced by 
its high speed through the interstel- 
lar hydrogen. After drifting for 12 
years (it has now covered four light 
years), it sheds its first stage, turns 
around, and begins deceleration. 

As the probe velocity drops well 
below relativistic speeds and it ap- 
proaches its target, the spacecraft 
opens up its compact one hundred 
kilogram mass into a sphere one 
hundred meters in diameter. The 
sphere is a dense wire mesh embed- 
ded with arrays of tiny sensors and 
transmitters, close-coupled to com- 
plex molecular-sized digital cir- 
cuitry, all held together and inter- 
connected with high strength, one- 
dimensional superconductive fibers. 

The probe turns its attention back 
to earth to receive its latest instruc- 
tions. A pulsating laser beam, 
bright through the background glare 
of the now distant sun brings a 
message from its masters on earth. 
Large new telescopes on the moon 
have detected a planet within the 
life-supporting zone of the small red 
dwarf star, Proxima Centauri: “Go 
and investigate!” The command is 
over four year old, but it is the 
most current that the probe can ex- 
pect. 

The array of sensors spaced over 
the sphere collect the light and radi- 



GAIAXY 




ation from the three stars in the 
Alpha Centauri system and correct 
the rocket thrust to zero in on Prox- 
ima Centauri. As it approaches the 
small red star, the probe searches 
for the planet. It is there, along 
with three others farther out. They 
are cold, and probably lifeless, but 
they too will be visited before the 
probe leaves Proxima Centauri to 
investigate the other two stars in the 
Alpha Centauri system. 

With its thruster at low power, 
the probe approaches the planet, 
constantly beaming pictures and 
sensor data back to earth, using a 
phased array of solid-state lasers 
scattered densely over its surface. 
Earth will not see the pictures of the 
new planet for four years, long after 
the probe has completed its survey 
and moved on to the other planets 
and stars in the Alpha Centauri sys- 
tem. With no feedback possible 
from earth, the molecular-sized 
computer circuits distributed 
throughout the mesh in the sphere 
analyze for themselves the informa- 
tion its sensors collect as it ap- 
proaches the planet, and the probe 
swings into a near polar orbit and 
begins a survey. 

Wideband sensors sensitive to the 
entire electromagnetic spectrum 
produce imagery in the radio, mi- 
crowave, infrared, visible, and ul- 
traviolet bands. The one-hundred- 
meter size of the detector array 
gives the pictures a resolution of 
less than one meter even from the 
1000 kilometer orbital altitude. 



Picosecond pulses of laser light 
beam down as a laser radar to mea- 
sure the height variations of the to- 
pography. Certain regions that 
might have life are interrogated with 
selected laser wavelengths, and their 
return light analyzed to look for ab- 
sorption or fluorescent bands char- 
acteristic of organic compounds. 

A few regions that have the most 
potential for life are selected. Small 
portions of the sensor mesh on the 
sphere detach from the main probe 
mesh and are driven down into the 
atmosphere with radiation pressure 
from the lasers on the probe. The 
small sections of mesh drift down to 
the surface, collecting and storing 
images as they descend. The mesh 
settles on the surface where 
specialized chemically sensitive 
molecular circuits react to the vari- 
ous forms of chemical compounds 
found there. The orbiting probe 
interrogates the lander mesh with a 
laser beam, collects the images and 
chemical data the lander has stored, 
combines it with the other informa- 
tion that it has collected and sends a 
detailed report back to earth. 

The probe then moves on to the 
next planet in the system, more 
slowly now, for it is no longer as 
lavishly supplied with fuel as it was 
at the start of its mission. It will not 
stop until it has made a complete 
survey of every planet in the three 
star system. This will take a long 
time, but the probe has a lot of 
time. It will be at least 30 years be- 
fore man will arrive to take over. ★ 



INTERSTELLAR PROBES AND STAR SHIPS

If saving Abe Lincoln 
was beyond him, how 
then could he save 
the wortd? 



On APRIL 14, 1865, James Wat- 
son crouched in the back shadows 
of Ford’s Theater in Washington 
City and waited with as much pa- 
tience as he could muster for John 
Wilkes Booth to come skulking 
past. When that happened, Watson 
intended to dart quickly from hiding 
and rap Wilkes on the skull, thus 
managing once again to preserve 
briefly the life of President Ab- 
raham Lincoln. Watson wasn’t ex- 
cited or nervous. He’d done this at 
least a hundred times before. 

But, before Watson could actu- 
ally move, he happened to glance 
down at his feet and noticed a sheet 
of folded white paper lying on the 
floor. It wasn’t the paper itself that 
attracted his attention, but the fact 
that he suddenly recognized his own 
name neatly printed upon the ex- 
posed surface of the sheet. 

He unfolded the paper and, 
straining against the surrounding 
darkness, read: 

Jim: I’ve got to see you right 
away. Remember the Log 
House? I’m there now and very 
ill so please come immediately. 
I’m convinced I’ve found a way 
to change everything. 

Rebecca Kingsley 

tHE TIDES OF TIME 



The broad expansive signature 
made Watson wince briefly. Re- 
becca Kingsley, the most famous 
actress of her age, but lately, like 
himself, an exiled timeride'r. What 
could she possibly want with him? 
He hadn’t seen her since shortly 
after the blast, when they had 
jointly created a wonderful, magical 
nineteenth-century Ireland, where 
Rebecca had reigned as a sort of 
queen of the stage. But that had 
been a transient phenomenon and 
after the tides of time rose to sweep 
their creation away Rebecca had left 
him without even a good-by. He 
had heard occasional rumors of her 
whereabouts from some of the other 
riders, who placed her variously in 
medieval England, twentieth-century 
Japan, and Bernhardt’s Paris. He 
had thought Garbo’s Hollywood a 
more likely location. 

And now she wanted to see him 
again. Demanded to see him again. 

He did remember the Log House. 
It was the place to which she had 
brought him when they’d first got- 
ten together. A modest cabin in the 
Colorado foothills of 4004 B.C. She 
never had told him who’d built it 
for her, but from the Joke of the 
date, he’d guessed William Stye. 

Soft, scraping footsteps sounded 
from below. Hastily, Watson tucked 
the message inside a pocket of his 
frock coat. Booth? Yes, un- 
doubtedly — but should he bother 
to wait? Rebecca Kingsley had beck- 
oned and, no matter how much 
youthful pain she had once caused 

45 




him, he knew he could not hesitate 
to go. 

His mind made up, Watson 
leaned more intimately into the 
shadows behind. As the footsteps 
drew closer, he shut his eyes and 
pictured the Log House as he re- 
membered it.’ A rising green country 
dappled with early spring snow. A 
puff of dark smoke streaming from 
the stone chimney. 

At first, he experienced no sensa- 
tion of motion but when he opened 
his eyes the gray, indistinct, spiral- 
ing blur of the timestream stretched 
endlessly in front of him. He shut 
his eyes again and waited patiently. 

When he opened his eyes once 
again, feeling a chill wind upon his 
face, he stood only a few yards in 
front of the Log House. It differed 
only slightly from the vision he had 
pictured. The logs were more worn, 
and the moss grew more thickly. 

At the doorstep, he paused a brief 
moment. What should he say when 
he saw her first? The words failed 
to come. Perhaps there were none. 
The whole thing had undoubtedly 
happened a long time ago, though 
he had no way of knowing that for 
sure. 

Stepping forward, Watson called 
out, “Rebecca, I’m here. It’s 
James.’’ 

★ ★ ★ 

He found Rebecca Kingsley in 
the second back bedroom. She lay 
in a wide bed covered with thick 

46 



blankets and a quilt. At first, he 
barely recognized her: the sunken, 
pale face of an old woman, the 
whisps of gray hair, the swollen lips 
and parched gums. Could this be 
the same woman who had once set 
the hearts of a billion men on fire? 

When she spoke, he knew it was 
she. The voice had hardly changed 
at all. “James, I knew I could trust 
you.’’ 

“Yes, I came.’’ Hestantly, he 
crossed the room. The floor, what 
little of it could be seen, was badly 
warped and cracked; the rest was 
piled high with a puzzling array of 
books, maps, charts and papers. 

He stood over her bed and strug- 
gled not to show the emotion he 
felt. “It’s been a long time.’’ 

She laughed. “You mean I’ve 
grown old.’’ 

“You — you’re sick.’’ He saw no 
reason to be unkind — not now. 

“I’m dying. But I’m dying be- 
cause I’m old. I was fifty-three 
when the blast did this to me. I 
could be eighty by now. Who 
knows?’’ 

He shook his head, trying to 
make sense of what she had said. 
Fifty-three? Then? This woman he 
had once loved?, “You said in your 
note that you wanted to see me for 
a reason.’’ Instinctively, he had 
drawn away from her in — what? — 
shock? — disgust? — revulsion? 

She pointed with a bony hand. 
“Look under my bed. Find what’s 
there and look at it.’’ 

He bent down obediently. His 

GALAXY 




fingers moved tentatively through 
the thickly piled dust until they 
closed around something round, 
heavy and slick. He withdrew his 
hand; in it he found a roll of paper. 
“What’s this?’’ he asked, sitting 
back on his heels. 

“Open it and see. It’s what I’ve 
been doing all these years — since 
Ireland fell apart.’’ 

Tucking one end underneath a 
heavy book — The Age of Faith — he 
drew the roll of paper across the 
floor, pushing aside the scattered 
piles of other books and papers. 
“You mean, aU that time, you were 
just here.” 

“Yes.” 

It was one place he would have 
never thought to look. “Some of 
the others said they’d seen you.” 
“People always think they’re see- 
ing me.” 

The roll of paper lay open upon 
the floor. He looked. It seemed to 
be some sort of historical chart. 
Dates ranging from 4500 B.C. 
through 1996 A.D. were printed 
across its top, while underneath 
were various notations. He read one 
that concerned him particularly: 
1865 — Lincoln not assassinated; Lee 
appointed to cabinet; freemen suf- 
frage voted down. “What’s this 
for?” he finally asked. 

“Can’t you guess?” 

“You want to change history.” 
“Exactly.” She was smiling 
again. 

“But don’t you know by now 
that it can’t be done? I would have 



thought Ireland would have showed 
you that. It can only be temporary. 
The tides of time always come 
sweeping back.” 

She seemed unmoved, a cold, 
brittle statue. “This chart lists six 
hundred separate historical inci- 
dents. All you’ve ever done before 
has been piecemeal. History is more 
like an avalanche. That was our 
mistake. One tiny pebble high on 
the mountain begins to fall, and that 
pebble strikes a bigger rock, which 
also falls, striking another and 
another and another. If you reach in 
and remove a rock from the middle 
of the mountain, then the slide will 
continue. I intend to remove the 
first pebble before it can begin to 
fall.” 

“But another pebble — one beside 
it — may come loose and start the 
slide anyway.” 

“I intend to remove all the peb- 
bles. Six hundred pebbles, rocks, 
and boulders. I can change history, 
James. When I’m done — when 
we’re done — then the blast will not 
occur.” 

He nodded. “1 thought you might 
have that in mind.” 

Her voice assumed a newer, deep- 
er tone. “It ruined all our lives, 
didn’t it? You know what I was be- 
fore it happened, who I was. All of 
that beauty ended, and for what rea- 
son? Because a half-dozen politi- 
cians suddenly went mad and de- 
cided to blow up the world.” 

“We were lucky. Five billion 
people died.” 



THE TIDES OF TIME

“Do you call this better?” 

He had no answer to that. She 
lived in a different world. “What 
do you want me to do? Help you 
cause these changes?” 

“Me?” She .laughed bitterly. 
“Damn it, can’t you see that I’m 
dying? What* can I do? No, we’ll 
need the others. All of them. Only 
by working together can we succeed 
before it’s too late.” 

He knew what she meant: too late 
for her. “I can ask them to help.” 
“No, you’ll bring them here. 
All — what is it? — ” 
“Twenty-seven.” 

“All twenty-seven of them. Five 
minutes after you leave, bring them. 
You know where to find them.” 

“1 think so.” 

“Good.” She smiled with sudden 
serenity. “And it’ll work, James. 1 
know it will.” 

He was staring at the chart. Was 
she right? He saw the rise of Egypt, 
the birth of Christ, the empire of 
T’ang, the visions of Leonardo, and 
the wars of Napoleon and Hitler. All 
of human history reduced to six 
hundred critical moments. Could all 
of time be so distorted, twisted into 
such an unrecognizable form, that 
like a child’s plastic doll it would 
fail ever to regain its original 
shape? 

Rebecca obviously thought so. 
And, if she was correct, then the 
end of the world need never have 
happened. 

* * * 



What James Watson called the 
end of the world was also known as 
the blast. The year was 1997, but 
Watson himself, then only twenty- 
two, a minor accountant in a West 
Coast banky remembered almost 
nothing of it. Only much later had 
he and the other timeriders been 
able to piece together what must 
have occurred that day. 

It was final, total, terrible nuclear 
war. Whisperings of such an event 
had long been heard on the wind, 
but no one — except perhaps the 
half-dozen men possessing the 
power to make it happen — had ever 
actually believed that such a disaster 
would come to be. 

But it had. Watson could re- 
member sitting quietly in the office 
that day, studying a pile of comput- 
erized accounts, when an enormous 
flash of light through the window 
had struck him suddenly blind. 

And then he had been falling. An 
endless, vague, indistinct, gray spi- 
ral swept around him. Hours might 
have passed — even days. 

And then a stray thought had 
come to him. He later understood 
that the thought had originated in a 
book he had been reading the previ- 
ous night. A history book. A his- 
tory of the American Civil War. 

And, as he fell, he happened to 
think of the great battle fought at 
Gettysburg. 

A split second later, he was 
there. At Gettysburg. On the 
battlefield. Overhead, rockets flared 
and cannonballs burst. 



46 



GALAXY 




That was the beginning. 

It took time — whether days, 
weeks, or months he could only 
guess — to understand, comprehend, 
develop, and accept his new talent. 
Eventually, he realized what he 
possessed was the freedom to roam 
at will the entirety of the known 
past. Simply by thinking of a singu- 
lar moment in time and space and 
then picturing that moment firmly 
and completely in his mind, he 
could travel there. 

The blast, whatever its effect on 
the rest of humanity, had somehow 
set him free from sequential time. 

There were limitations also. If he 
didn’t know enough of a particular 
time to picture it realistically, he 
could not travel there. Nor could 
the same body ever occupy more 
than once the same point in time. 
What this meant was that any time 
subsequent to June 18, 1975 — the 
date of his own birth — was perma- 
nently closed to him. 

It wasn’t until Rebecca Kingsley 
found him that he realized he was 
not alone. He was eating dinner in a 
plush restaurant in New York in 
1836 when an astonishingly familiar 
woman had suddenly sat down 
across the table from him. She said, 
“You’re the one, aren’t you?’’ 

Unable at first to believe his own 
eyes, he replied, “No. No, 1 don’t 
think so.’’ 

“You know who I am, don’t 
you?’’ Her composure was perfect. 
They could have been discussing 
next week’s weather. 



“You’re Rebecca Kingsley,’’ he 
blurted out. 

“And you’re from 1997, blown 
here by the blast.’’ 

“The what?’’ 

“The big war. That’s what I call 
it — the blast.’’ Because of what it’s 
done to all our lives. Blasted them 
completely to ruins.’’ 

He and Rebecca Kingsley spent 
that evening together in his hotel 
room — lifting a considerable 

number of eyebrows in the 
process — fulfulling, at least par- 
tially, an old fantasy of his. 

She had explained how she had 
found him through a simple process 
of elimination. “When you’re in 
time and not supposed to be there, 
you’re going to do things that 
wouldn’t otherwise be done. You’re 
going to cause little waves to ripple 
on the pool of history. Say, for in- 
stance, tonight when you were eat- 
ing at that nice restaurant. Suppose, 
normally, instead of you, another 
man was sitting there. Suppose a 
woman happened to pass the table 
and caught his eye. Suppose they 
talked, became friends, lovers, and 
later married. Suppose they had 
iwelve children, each of whom had 
seven of his or her own. In that 
case, because of you being here to- 
night, a hundred years from now 
several hundred people will no 
longer exist. Now further suppose 
that I’m another time traveler 
operating in 1936. When all sorts of 
people around me start winking out 
of existence, most other people 



THE TIDES OF TIME 



49 




won’t notice — but I will. A little bit 
of research — who’s winking out and 
why — and it’s not too difficult to 
trace down the trouble center. 
That’s how we’ve found each other 
so far.” 

‘‘You mean there are more than 
just you and me?’ ’ 

‘‘Nineteen others so far. All from 
1997. All tossed here by the blast.” 
‘‘I — I’d like to meet them.” 

‘‘CMi, you will. But they’re ordi- 
nary people. Not like me. You 
won’t have heard of them. ” 

It was then that she had gone on 
to explain to him how, working to- 
gether, they could create from the 
raw material of Irish history a place 
that would be like paradise for both 
of them. 

And of course he had agreed to 
go with her. 

In the end, a total of twenty-nine 
timeriders had been discovered. As 
for the others — a world population 
in 1997 approaching five billion — 
they had no way of finding out any- 
thing about them: even if the world 
hadn’t ended with the blast, they 
would probably never know what 
happened afterwards. 

But now Rebecca Kingsley 
claimed that, whether the world was 
dead or not, she could resurrect it. 
The tides of time, which heretofor 
had permitted only brief, transitory 
change, could be fought, battled, 
subdued, and conquered. 

Yet Watson wondered. The blast 
had created them — made them 
timeriders — given them this non- 

50 



sequential universe in which to 
roam. 

Could they now rise up and will- 
ingly strike down their own maker? 

■k -k * 

From choice — and uncertainty 
— Watson emerged from the time- 
stream several hundred yards from 
his intended destination. He stood 
upon the familiar soft shore of a 
shallow forest pool, inhaling the 
thick scent of surrounding Georgia 
pine and battled to realign his 
senses in terms of this new place. 

A loud splashing sound slapped 
the still air and Watson glanced up 
to see a flash of dazzling whiteness 
sliding underneath the dark waters 
of the pool. He recognized the girl 
at once. “Gina,” he cried, when 
her head broke the surface. 

“Oh, James.” She waved and 
swam toward him. Gina was 
younger than Watson — she’d been 
in college at the time of the 
blast — but they had once spent a 
fair amount of time together. 

When she emerged from the 
pool, she embraced him with her 
wet arms. “Well, I was afraid we’d 
lost you for good.” 

In the Joy of seeing her again, he 
dismissed all thought of Rebecca 
and her plan. “I’ve been busy.” 
“Still saving Abe Lincoln?” 

He shrugged. “It’s an obses- 
sion.” 

“You’re too serious.” 

“I know.” 



GALAXY 




As they moved through the forest 
toward the main house Watson con- 
sidered telling her what he had to 
say, but decided to wait until later 
when everyone was together. Ac- 
cording to Gina, ten other riders 
were presently staying in the house 
ahead. It was called Newport — in 
honor of a once famous resort — and 
took up a totally inconspicuous plot 
of land in central Georgia some- 
where around the year 10,000 B.C. 
Some time ago (he could, of 
course, be no more specific than 
that), shortly after the end of his re- 
lationship with Rebecca, a group of 
them had joined to build the house 
as a sort of rest-home for weary 
riders. A few people stayed at 
Newport on an almost permanent 
basis, but most, like Watson him- 
self, and Gina, appeared only occa- 
sionally. All of them made it a 
point to maintain sequential time as 
near as possible when visiting the 
colony. Such a policy avoided un- 
necessary confusion and kept the 
tides of time from rushing in. 

Gina was telling him about a re- 
cent cross-country journey she had 
undertaken on a wagon train in 
1846. “We were even attacked by 
Indians,” she said. “Not a whole 
tribe, thank God, just a few 
marauders. But the whole thing was 
such an interesting experience — and 
so much fun. You ought to try it, 
James. Get out of New York and 
see the rest of the country.” 

“I’ve been to Boston. Even San 
Francisco — after the gold rush.” 

THE TIDES OF TIME 



“And you ought to leave poor 
Lincoln alone, too.” She seemed 
full of suggestions today. “I can 
always tell when you’ve been 
around, when people start talking 
about Ape Lincoln instead of the 
Great Martyr.” 

“I don’t do it as a favor to his 
reputation.” 

“Then why do you do it?” 

“Just to prove that I can, I 
guess.” 

“But the tides always obliterate 
it.” 

“And that’s why I have to keep 
doing it. Over and over again.” 

Inside the big house — with its 
thick carpets, beautiful paintings, 
graceful sculpture and plush decor 
borrowed randomly from all of 
history — Watson leaned in the 
doorway of the downstairs parlor, 
while Gina excused herself to wan- 
der upstairs and dress. 

Once his eyes adjusted to the cur- 
tained darkness beyond, Watson 
counted four familiar figures clus- 
tered near the smoldering embers of 
the fireplace. William Stye was a 
huge, round man, a former grocery 
clerk who now spent most of his 
time in Elizabethan England. Stye 
was presently talking, describing a 
rather tenuous relationship between 
Shakespeare and the Queen. Listen- 
ing were Thomas Kittering, an un- 
successful artist who now lived in 
renaissance Venice, Hoy Ling, a 
Chinese farmer who divided his 
time between his country’s numer- 
ous golden ages, and Thelma Nor- 



51 




ton, formerly a waitress and noW a 
sort of eternal prostitute. Thelma 
said the best way to get to know the 
real substance of any particular time 
was to catch the denizens at their 
most informal. She currently wore 
the high, gaudy fashions of the late 
1920’s. 

Looking in this way, hearing Stye 
talk and seeing the others, Watson 
realized how very much he liked 
these people. He felt glad to be 
home again. 

Stye was the one who noticed 
him standing in the doorway. 
“Hey, Jim, it’s been a long while. 
Come in and get warm.” 

Watson went into the room. “I 
didn’t know it was cold.” 

“It isn’t, but you’ve got lo admit 
that the fire is nice.” 

He nodded to each of the other 
three. Thelma rose daintily and 
pecked his cheek. The dwindling 
fire painted crazy, distorted 
shadows along the wall. Everyone 
seemed to stand twice as high as he 
should. 

“I’ve been to see Rebecca Kings- 
ley,” he said. 

“Oh.” 

Thelma finally asked, “How is 
she?” 

“Not well. In fact . well, I 
think she’s dying.” 

He hated to be the one who 
spoiled the atmosphere. 

Gina entered the room from be- 
hind him. “We’d all thought she’d 
died long ago,” she said, without a 
trace of gloom. 



He turned thankfully to face her. 
“No, she’s been hiding out in Col- 
orado. In a cabin she has. 4004 
B.C.” 

“I remember the place,” Stye 
said. 

“You’d think,” Gina said, “a 
person like her couldn’t stand so 
much quiet. Think of all that 
applause she was used to. There’s 
nobody there now but some In- 
dians.” 

“She’s been working,” Watson 
said. “Studying, I guess you could 
call it. And she’s found something 
out — something she thinks is impor- 
tant.” 

“Well, what?” said Stye. 

“I’d rather everyone were here at 
once before I told you.” 

“It can’t be that important,” 
Thomas Kittering said. 

“1 think it may be,” said Wat- 
son. 

Gina was looking at him intently, 
with something approaching suspi- 
cion. “Did Rebecca send' you here 
with instructions to reveal this se- 
cret of hers?” 

He saw rto reason to be less than 
truthful. “She did.” 

But Stye was already on his feet. 
Bustling toward the door, he paused 
and told Watson, “I’ll see who I 
can round up. Later we’ll all talk. 
You haven’t been around here in 
years, Jim.” 

Watson shook his head. ‘‘I 
wouldn’t say that.” For a timerider, 
no such thing as a year existed; 
there was only time itself.

GALAXY 




* ★ ★ 

Once he had told them every- 
thing, Watson leaned close to the 
fire and waited for a response. 

No one said a word. 

When he could bear their silence, 
no longer Watson said, “Well? 
Come on. Somebody must have 
something to say.” 

“It won’t work,” William Stye 
said decisively. “There may be 
some degree of sense to it, but I 
just don’t think so. At one time or 
another I imagine everyone here has 
tried to alter history, rearrange past 
events. I know I once married 
Shakespeare to the Queen. But it 
never lasts — it can’t be 
permanent — so why bother?” 

“Rebecca thinks her way will 
work. And, if she’s right, then five 
billion people will be alive.” 

“But won’t they all die any- 
way?” said a rider named Charles 
Francis, whom Watson didn’t know 
particularly well. Before the blast, 
Francis had labored as some sort of 
dim civil servant; he now wore the 
garb of a Roman centurion. 

“Yes,” said Watson, “but there 
are descendants to consider. ’ ’ 
“Why?” Gina asked sharply. 
“Why should we be the ones to 
consider them? We didn’t blow up 
the world. Why should we have to 
save it?” 

“I don’t think anybody has said 
that we have to do this.” 

“Still,” said Thelma Norton, 




THE TIDES OF TIME 



53 



who had changed into a less reveal- 
ing costume, “it’s= quite an honor if 
you think about it. How many other 
whores have ever saved the 
world?” 

‘‘Then you think we ought to do 
it?” Knowing their answer in ad- 
vance, Watson was eager to get this 
finished. 

‘‘We can’t very well say no,” 
Thelma said. 

‘‘Why can’t we?” asked Charles 
Francis. 

“Because,” said William Stye, 
“it’s not going to work anyway.” 

“But how can you be sure of 
that?” Gina asked. 

Watson felt he ought to say 
something now. He faced Gina. 
“It’s never worked before so we’ve 
always assumed history to be an in- 
exorable process, something firm 
and definte. Take me, for instance. 
I’m always saving Abraham Lin- 
coln’s life. Do you know why? Be- 
cause, no matter how often I do it, 
nothing ever really changes. With 
Lincoln alive or Lincoln dead, the 
world goes on pretty much the 
same. If you took a man from one 
version of 1866 and put him down 
in another — the one where Lincoln 
lived — he wouldn’t know anything 
had happened unless he glanced at a 
newspaper.” 

“But you said Rebecca had found 
six hundred things to change,” 
someone said. 

“That’s correct.” 

“Six hundred things in six 
thousand years of history,” William 

54 



Stye said skeptically. 

It was Thelma Norton who 
voiced what everyone else was 
thinking. “But suppose it does 
work. Suppose we do away with the 
blast and do it permanently. What 
happens then?” 

“One thing,” Gina said, “is that 
Rebecca gets to be a big star 
again.” 

“And she won’t have to die,” 
Watson said, more kindly. 

“But what about us?” asked 
Charles Francis. “Will we just — 
just go back?” 

Watson nodded. “I imagine so. 
The blast created us. Without it, 
we’ll just go on with our old lives 
as if nothing had happened.” 

“Because nothing will have hap- 
pened,” Gina said. 

Watson nodded. “Except that 
five billion people — and a whole 
world — will be alive.” 

“I still say it won’t work,” said 
William Stye. 

* it it 

While those timeriders who had 
not been present at Newport were 
being tracked down within the 
timestream, Watson remained in the 
big house, resting, talking, swim- 
ming, and sleeping. A dim, mourn- 
ful mood seemed to grip the place. 
Those riders not out in the stream 
kept close to their rooms or else 
huddled in the parlor close to the 
fire. Watson and Gina went walking 
in the woods. When they reached 

GALAXY 




the pool where Watson had first ar- 
rived, Gina said she was tired and 
wanted to stop. 

They lay side by side upon the 
wet grass and stared at the flat, 
smooth surface of the water. Wat- 
son discovered that when he 
glanced at Gina in this bright light 
he could clearly discern the first 
signs of aging in the skin around 
her eyes. He suddenly understood 
how much time must have passed 
since the blast first sent them here: 
Gina was old, Rebecca was dying, 
and he himself felt very, very tired. 

“Well, what do you think?” she 
said at last. ‘‘I don’t suppose 
there’s anything to be gained by 
pretending it’s not happening.” 

“No.” He knew what she meant. 
“But I can’t tell you. I saw the 
chart, but that’s all. Maybe it’ll 
work and maybe it won’t.” 

She nodded thoughtfully. “Do 
you want it to?” 

He shrugged. “Why? Don’t 
you?’ ’ 

She shook her head. “I’m just 
not sure. There’s her, for one thing. 
1 don’t want her to die 
but . well, does it seem fair to 
you? Rebecca was someone impor- 
tant in that other world, but the rest 
of us — we were nothing. William 
ran a grocery, you were a book- 
keeper, and I was still attending 
school. James, I think I’m too old 
to go back to college.” 

“You’ll never even know you 
were gone,” he said. 

“I know and that’s the most 



frightening thing of all. It’s almost 
like killing yourself. All these years 
lost and gone. I won’t remember 
the wagon train — not any of it.” 

“We’ll all lose a lot.” 

“No, we won’t.” She rose on an 
elbow, stiff with anger. “She 
won’t — Rebecca won’t — because 
she doesn’t have anything to lose. I 
was so excited when she first found 
me. She was something I knew, 
someone famous, and I had been 
completely lost until then. But she 
never cared. She never saw the pos- 
sibilities. She hated the past. She 
still does. She hates it because here 
she’s nothing.” 

“I’m not sure that’s entirely 
fair.” 

“It’s still twenty-eight of us 
against one of her.” 

“No,” he said. “It’s twenty- 
eight of us against five billion of 
them.” 

She sighed and dropped back 
down. “I know. And that’s why we 
have to do it.” 

ir it -k 

At last the moment came when 
all twenty-eight timeriders had been 
found and brought to the big house 
and informed of Rebecca’s plan. 
Together they fell into the waves of 
time, propelled by Watson’s de- 
scription of the cabin in the woods, 
and in time they emerged in the 
Colorado Rockies of 4004 B.C., 
only minutes after Watson’s last de- 
parture. 



THE TIDES OF TIME

He led the way into the rear bed- 
room where Rebecca lay waiting. 
Even in such a short period of time, 
she had visibly deteriorated. As the 
riders crowded around her bed, all 
of them showing their obvious dis- 
comfort at the nearness of death, 
she struggled to sit up to greet 
them. Finally, Watson adjusted her 
pillow so that she could use it as a 
backrest. “Well, so you decided to 
come, after all,” she said in hardly 
more than a whisper. Her eyes 
shifted slowly from face to face, 
pausing only briefly at each. “Wil- 
liam Stye, Georgia Kane, Charles 
Francis — 1 know you all so well.” 

“It’s been a long time, Re- 
becca,” said Stye, speaking for all 
of them. 

“But you don’t know how long, 
do you?” She laughed hoarsely. 
“That’s the problem, isn’t it? We 
never know how much time we 
have.” 

Watson shifted uncertainly at the 
head of the bed. “I’ve told them 
everything you told me, Rebecca, 
and everyone is agreed. We’re 
ready to begin now.” 

“Ready to begin to give me my 
world back?” she said bitterly. 

“No, to save the lives of five bil- 
lion people,” Gina said. 

Rebecca appeared not to recog- 
nize her. “And yourselves.” 

“No, not us, Rebecca — Just 
you.” 

Watson could see no gain in such 
bickering. “Perhaps we ought to get 
started,” he suggested. 



“An excellent idea, James.” Re- 
becca smiled thinly. “Considering 
my condition, the sooner, the bet- 
ter.” She pointed one brittle finger. 
“The chart is there on the floor 
where you left it. I’m afraid I’ll 
have to ask you to take charge. 
Begin at the beginning. The first in- 
cident you find — it’s Sumerian writ- 
ing, 1 believe — and then follow 
through. I recommend each of you 
try to return within moments of 
your last departure. There are only 
twenty-eight of you and six hundred 
incidents to cover. This will take, if 
you’ll excuse the term, time, and 
I’m not sure if I have that much left 
to me. Perhaps if I do die first, it 
won’t make any difference — I will 
still live then. But some things must 
be permanent — and death may well 
be one of them.” 

William Stye stepped forward and 
volunteered to go first. “I’ve been 
to Sumeria before.” 

Gina said she would be second. 

The others formed a line in front 
of the chart. 

Watson read the historical inci- 
dents one after another and made 
certain each rider was straight in his 
mind about the date. 

As they moved, no one spoke. 
One after another they winked out 
of existence. 

After Charles Francis had left for 
Stonehenge and 1700 B.C., Watson 
was alone with Rebecca once more. 

She smiled at him and her voice 
took on a new strength. “It will 
work,” she said.

“Are you sure you want — ?” But 
he stopped. William Stye 
materialized in the center of the 
room. 

* * * 

Once the operation was moving 
efficiently Watson grew tired of 
waiting and decided to join the 
others in the timestream. When he 
returned from 1066 and the Battle 
of Hastings he found himself alone 
with Rebecca. Even though no more 
than three hours could possibly have 
passed since their first arrival, she 
seemed noticeably drained. He 
watched her lips moving silently 
and suddenly understood she was 
trying to call him. 

He left the chart and went over to 
kneel beside the bed. “Yes, Re- 
becca.” 

“James,” she said, as if uncer- 
tain of his real identity. 

“Yes.” 

“You don’t understand this, do 
you?” 

“No. No, but I think you do.” 

“It’s because of Ireland.” 

He hadn’t expected that. “It is?” 

“Yes. Do you remember what 
we did there?” 

“I remember that we altered his- 
tory so as to drive the English out 
during Elizabeth’s reign. And then 
we broke with Rome and estab- 
lished a liberal Catholic church and 
revived all the old myths and 
legends and created a country where 
the arts would blossom.” 



It is the 21st century, but Scop is in 
1963— attending assassinations. He’s 
warned, cajoled, pleaded ... but be 
knows be’s a failure. Trying to alter 
the future, he has merely reinforced it! 




“And then we became stars,” 
she said. 

“Well, you did.” 

She nodded. “But that was what 
hurt — what made it seem no good. 
It wasn’t real, James — it never 
was — and I always knew it. You 
see, we could have done it again. 
Not necessarily in Ireland but 
somewhere else. It was a lot of 
work, and it didn’t last long, but we 
could have started over.” 

“Yes, I suppose so. I just never 
thought. When you went away, that 
seemed to end it.” 

“But don’t you know why?” 

“I thought I did. I thought you

THE TIDES OF TIME 



were angry because of the tides. 
When that world was washed away, 
everything seemed suddenly sense- 
less.” 

“No, James, that’s close but not 
it. The senselessness began before, 
when the world we created was still 
firm. It was’ senseless because we 
had made it that way. We were 
successful and famous — I was — and 
we had everything, but there was no 
pleasure in it. Do you see what I’m 
saying? Why try to win when 
there’s nothing to struggle, 
against?” 

“Yes, I see.” 

She shook her head. “No, you 
don’t. You can’t., You’re not me, 
James, and none of the others are, 
either. Of course you resent me. 
But try to remember that nothing I 
achieved came easily and, when I 
could have had it that way, in Ire- 
land, I refused.” 

“Is this easy?” He indicated the 
chart. 

“There’s no pleasure in it, 
either.’’ She lay back, her eyes 
suddenly closing. 

He waited a moment, wondering 
if he should go on and tell her, but 
knew it was too late now to turn 
back. 

Standing, he went to the chart 
and found the next date. 

Then he rode the stream of time 
once again.

Sitting boredly at his desk in 
58 



1997, James Watson glanced with 
half an eye at the stack of comput- 
erized accounts he had been given 
to review. Across the wide, air- 
conditioned room a clock said 3:30; 
he would be unable to escape this 
place for another hour and a half. 
The tickets were in his pocket. Two 
theater tickets. It was odd because, 
until a few weeks ago, he had never 
felt much interest in live drama. 
Then he happened to glimpse Re- 
becca Kingsley on television and 
had strangely fallen in love with 
that fragile image. That was where 
he was going tonight: Rebecca 
Kingsley in Medea . 

Then someone came into the 
room — a clerk he faintly 
recognized — and said in a loud 
voice that he had just heard on the 
radio that Rebecca Kingsley had 
died. 

Watson stood up to shout, and 
then he was falling. A vague, indis- 
tinct gray spiral surrounded him. 

Thinking quickly, he pictured in 
his mind a log house in the Col- 
orado mountains surrounded by 
green grass and a dappling of early 
spring snow. 

As that world emerged in front of 
him, he felt the tickets in his pocket 
and wondered what they might 
mean. 



it it it 

She was dead. 

Watson stood above the bed, star- 
GALAXY 




ing down at that thin, emaciated 
figure which had once been so 
beautiful and alive. He wondered: 
did she ever know? It hadn’t 
worked — the tides had come sweep- 
ing in. He hoped against hope that 
Rebecca had somehow been permit- 
ted to die unaware. She had made it 
home — he knew that for certain. He 
only hoped she had been able to 
stay there. 

Removing the two tickets from 
his pocket, he dropped them on the 
bed and let them lie there. 

“Then she didn’t make it?’’ said 
a voice past his shoulder. 

Turning, he saw Gina. He 
pointed at the tickets. “She was 
there.’’ 

“You saw her?’’ , 

“No, but I was going to. 1 guess 
some of it must have stayed with 
me. I always thought she was beauti- 
ful but suddenly I wanted to see 
her, too.’’ 

Gina produced a single matching 
ticket from a pocket of her torn 
sweater. “Me, too.’’ The faint lines 
creased her face. He knew then it 
was definitely over. They were 
growing old again. “I wonder 
which one it was,’’ she said. 

He turned away from the body 
but didn’t walk away. “What do 
you mean?’’ 

“It must have been one of us,’’ 
she said. “Out of six hundred inci- 
dents, neglecting even one might 
have been enough to undo the rest. 
Someone lied and made it so it 
wouldn’t work. Someone didn’t do 



what he was supposed to.’’ 

He looked as if he had been 
shocked. “That’s a dreadful thing 
to think. Five billion people are 
dead.” 

“Not us.” 

“We never were.” 

She shook her head. “Are you 
sure? Don’t you remember how it 
was?” 

He could recall the dreariness of 
that awful world back there. “It 
was the tides of time. We tried to 
beat it — she did — and failed.” 
“No.’’ Gina wouldn’t quit so 
easily. “I’m as guilty as the next 
person because I knew what had 
happened and said nothing. You 
see, I looked at the chart. The Bat- 
tle of Hastings. The Normans were 
supposed to win but William the 
Conquerer was to have died. 1 must 
have been the next person to visit 
England. He was still alive.” 

“An oversight.” 

She laughed. “Don’t be silly, 
James.” 

“It couldn’t have been that im- 
portant.” 

She shrugged and crossed to the 
still unfurled chart. Crouching 
down, she ran her finger across the 
dates. “I wonder who it was. Stye 
maybe, or Francis. It could have 
been any one of us.” 

“Yes. Anyone.” 

“We were selfish.” 

“But so was she.” 

Suddenly, impulsively, Gina 
began to roll up the chart. “Let’s 
bum it,” she said. ★

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

By name I am Robinette Broadhead, 
and by profession I am rich retired 
millionaire. I am so rich that I can af- 
ford the best psychiatrist in New York, 
who happens to be a machine whom I 
call Sigfrid von Shrink. I suppose all 
that sounds pretty gay and jolly, but 
there’s nothing funny about Sigfrid. 
He hurts me a lot. 

Sigfrid would say that was untrue. 
He would say that the pain comes out 
of the inner parts of me, and especially 
out of my life, which, to be sure, has 
not been all pleasure. / grew up in the 
Wyoming food mines. You know what 
that’s like. Sheer hell. You dig the 
shale, boil out the oil, grow the 
single-cell protein on the oil 
substrate-and qfter a while you learn 
to hold out a little for yourself, to fer- 
ment and drink so you can forget what 
kind of a life you’re living. There were 
six or seven million of us doing that in 
Just my part of the world when I was 
young. Not one of us had anything to 
look forward to but spending our 
whole lives in the hydrocarbon smog of 
Wyoming, with kerogen ground into 
the pores of our skin and the roots of 
our hair. But for me it turned out dif- 
ferent. I had a stroke of luck. I won a 
lottery, and I came out of it with 
enough money to buy a one-way ticket 
to Gateway, and thus to possess the 
right to take part in the biggest lottery 
of them all; the chance to explore the 
universe for fun, profit and a first-rate 
shot at an early and unpleasant death. 
(I said it was a stroke of luck. I didn’t 
say it was good luck.) 

Gateway was Something Else. It 
hung out in space, waiting for people 

GATEWAY 



to come and find it. It wasn’t a natural 
object. It was an artifact, the 
hollowed-out shell of an asteroid or 
maybe the core of a comet, no one was 
quite sure. Its surface was studded 
with interstellar spaceships, all fueled 
and aimed and ready to take off for the 
ends of the Galaxy. There were a 
couple of problems. For one, although 
Gateway wasn’t natural, it wasn’t 
man-made either. It was made by that 
long-lost and not altogether com- 
prehensible race called the Heechee, 
and abandoned by them along about 
the time Australopithecusafricanus/irs( 
learned how to bash an enemy’s head 
in with the thighbone of an antelope. 
For another, you never knew quite 
where you were going. The automatic 
navigation was quite efficient, but it 
had been preset by Heechee hands half 
a million years ago. When you got into 
a ship you might come out in orbit 
around a fair green planet loaded with 
treasure. You might also come out in 
the photosphere of a star. Or you 
might never come back at all, and no 
one would ever know why. 

Everybody on Gateway was part of 
the exploration team, that was . why 
they were there. Some were just wait- 
ing for the flight that would make 
them rich, like my friend Gelle-Klara 
Moynlin. Some were waiting for I 
don’t know what, like my other friend 
Shikitei Bakin, who had lost his legs 
and a lot of his courage in some acci- 
dent or other, and stayed on Gateway, 
maybe, mostly because it had so close 
to no gravity at all that he could get 
around by strapping wings to his arms 
and flying where he wanted to go. 
After I got to Gateway, and took the 
laughably brief course in interstellar 
navigation and so on (what did you 
have to know when the ships knew 

61 




where they were going, and wouldn’t 
tell?), I found I was waiting too; and 
what I was waiting for was to find 
spmething I had misplaced, namely my 
guts. 

My girl-friend Sheri, who had come 
up with me and gone through training 
with me, finally got tired of watching 
me stall and Wok off on a flight with- 
out me. I didn’t mind, or at least not 
as muck as I would have minded if she 
had somehow forced me to go with 
her. There were other flights (when / 
got around to it), and other girls; / 
took up with Klara, and we hit it off 
beautifully. She was scared too. 

But time went on, and almost ev- 
eryone we knew shipped out. Somehow 
Klara and I got our courage together 
long enough to get aboard a five-man 
ship. 

And it turned out to be a bust. 

We traveled God knows how many 
light-years, and came out too far from 
any interesting planet to be able to 
reach it; so we turned around and 
came back empty-handed. 

That was nothing unusual. Most 
trips came back empty. When they 
came back at all. But then I got the 
word that Sheri’s flight was back-the 
one / had refused to go on, remember? 
And they had struck it very, very 
rich . without me. 

XX 

I WENT BACK to iTiy own room that 
night, but it took me a long time to 
get to sleep: and Shicky woke me 
up early to tell me what was hap- 
pening. There had been only three 
survivors, and their base award had 
already been announced: seventeen 
million five hundred and fifty 
thousand dollars. Against royalties. 

62 



That drove the sleepies out of my 
eyes. “For what?” 1 demanded. 

Shicky said, “For twenty-three 
kilograms of artifacts. They think 
it’s a repair kit. Possibly for a ship, 
since that is where they found it, in 
a lander on the surface of the 
planet. But at least they are tools of 
some sort.” 

“Tools.” 1 got up, and got rid of 
Shicky, and plodded down the tun- 
nel to the community shower, think- 
ing about tools. Tools could mean a 
lot. Tools could mean a way to 
open the drive mechanism in the 
Heechee ships without blowing up 
everything around. Tools could 
mean finding out how the drive 
worked, and building our own. 
Tools could mean almost anything, 
and what they certainly meant was a 
cash award of seventeen million 
five hundred and fifty thousand dol- 
lars, not counting royalties, divided 
three ways. 

One of which could have been 
mine. 

It is hard to get a figure like 
$5,850,000 out of your mind (not to 
mention royalties) when you think 
that if you had been a little more 
foreseeing in your choice of girl- 
friends you could have had it in 
your pocket. Call it six million dol- 
lars. At my age and health I could 
have bought paid-up Full Medical 
for less than half of that, which 
meant all the tests, therapies, tissue 
replacements and organ transplants 
they could cram into me for the rest 
of my life . which would have 
been at least fifty years longer than 
I could expect without it. The other 
three million plus would have 
bought me a couple of homes, a 
career as a lecturer (nobody was

A NOTE ON NEUTRON STARS 

Dr. Asmenion. Now, you get a 
star that has used up its fuel and it 
collapses. When I say "col- 
lapses", I mean it's shrunk so far 
that the whole thing, that starts out 
with maybe the mass and volume 
of the sun, is squeezed into a ball 
maybe ten kilometers across. 
That's dense. If your nose was 
made out of neutron star stuff, 
Susie, it would weigh more than 
Gateway does. 

Question. Maybe even more 
than you do, Yuri? 

Dr. Asmenion. Don't make 
jokes in class. Teacher's sensitive. 
Anyway, good, close-in readings 
on a neutron star would be worth 
a lot, but I don't advise you to use 
your lander to get them. You need 
to be in a fully armored Five, and 
then I wouldn't come much closer 
than a tenth of an A.U. And 
watch it. It'll look as though 
probably you could get closer, but 
the gravity shear is bad. It's prac- 
tically a point source, you see. 
Steepest gravity gradient you'll 
ever see, unless you happen to 
get next to a black hole, God for- 
bid. 



more in demand than a successful 
prospector), a steady income for 
doing commercials on PV, women, 
food, cars, travel, women, fame, 
women . and, again, there were 
always the royalties. They could 
have come to anything at all, de- 
pending on what the R&D people 
managed to do with the tools. 
Sheri’s find was exactly what 
Gateway was all about: the pot of 
gold at the end of the rainbow. 

GATEWAY 



It took an hour for me to get 
down to the hospital, three tunnel 
segments and five levels in the 
dropshaft. I kept changing my mind 
and going back. 

When I finally managed to purge 
my mind of envy (or at least to 
bury it where I didn’t think it was 
going to show) and turned up at the 
reception desk, Sheri was asleep 
anyway. “You can go in,” said the 
w^ nurse. 

“I don’t want to wake her up.” 

“I don’t think you could,” he 
said. “Don’t force it, of course. 
But she’s allowed visitors.” 

She was in the lowest of three 
bunks in a twelve-bed room. Three 
or four of the others were occupied, 
two of them behind the isolation 
curtains, milky plastic that you 
could see through only vaguely. I 
didn’t know who they were. Sheri 
herself looked quite peacefully rest- 
ing, one arm under her head, her 
pretty eyes closed and her strong, 
dimpled chin resting on her wrist. 
Her two companions were in the 
same room, one asleep, one sitting 
under a holoview of Saturn’s rings. 
I had met him once or twice, a 
Cuban or Venezuelan or something 
like that from New Jersey. TTie only 
name 1 could remember for him was 
Manny. We chatted for a while, and 
he promised to tell Sheri I had been 
there. I left and went for a cup of 
coffee at the comissary, thinking 
about their trip. 

They had come out near a tiny, 
cold planet way out from a K-6 
orange-red cinder of a star, and ac- 
cording to Manny they hadn’t even 
been sure it was worth the trouble 
of landing. The readings showed 
Heechee-metal radiation, but not

A NOTE ON PRAYER FANS 

Question. You didn't tell us 
anything about Heechee prayer 
fans, and we see more of them 
than anything else. 

Prof. Hegramet. What do you 
want me to tell you, Susie? 

Question' Well I know what 
they look like. Sort of like a 
rolled-up ice-cream cone made 
out of crystal. All different colors 
of crystal. If you hold one right 
and press on it with your thumb it 
opens up like a fan. 

Prof. Hegramet. That's what I 
know, too. They've been 
analyzed, same as fire pearls and 
the blood diamonds. But don't ask 
me what they're for. I don't think 
the Heechee fanned themselves 
with them, and I don't think they 
prayed either; that's just what the 
novelty dealers called them. The 
Heechee 4eft them all over the 
place, even when they tidied ev- 
erything else up. I suppose they 
had a reason. I don't have a clue 
what th'at reason was, but if I ever 
find out I'll tell you. 



much; and almost all of it, appa- 
rently, was buried under carbon- 
dioxide snow. Manny was the one 
who stayed in orbit. Sheri and the 
other three went down, found a 
Heechee dig, opened it with great 
effort and, as usual, found it empty. 
Then they tracked another trace and 
found the old lander. They had to 
blast to get it open, and in the pro- 
cess two of the prospectors lost in- 
tegrity of their spacesuits — too close 
to the blast, I guess. By the time 
they realized they were in trouble it 
was too late for them. They froze. 

64 



Sheri and the other crewman tried 
to get them back into their own 
lander, it must have been pure mis- 
ery and fear the whole time, and at 
the end they had to give up. Tlie 
other man had made one more trip 
to the abandoned lander, found the 
tool kit in it, managed to get it back 
to their own lander. Then they had 
taken off, leaving the two casualties 
peacefully frozen behind them. But 
they had overstayed their limit and 
they were physical wrecks when 
they docked with the orbiter. I 
wasn’t clear on what happened after 
that, but apparently they had failed 
to secure the lander’s air supply and 
had lost a good deal of it; so they 
were on short oxygen rations all the 
way home. The other man was 
worse off than Sheri. There was a 
good chance of residual brain dam- 
age, and his $5,850,000 might not 
do him much good. But Sheri, they 
said, would be all right once she re- 
covered from plain exhaustion. 

I didn’t envy them the trip. All 1 
envied them was the reward. 

I got up and got myself another 
cup of coffee in the commissary. As 
I brought it back to the corridor 
outside, where there were a few 
benches under the ivy planters, I 
became aware that something was 
bugging me. Something about the 
trip. About the fact that it had been 
a real winner, one of the all-time 
greats of Gateway’s history. 

I dumped the coffee, cup and all,' 
into a disposal hole outside the 
commissary and headed for the 
school room. It was only a few 
minutes away and there was no one 
else there. TTiat was good; I wasn’t 
ready to talk to anyone yet about 
what had occurred to me. I keyed 

GALAXY 




the P-phone to information access 
and got the settings for Sheri’s trip; 
they were, of course, a matter of 
public record. Then I went down to 
the practice capsule, and again hit 
lucky because there was no one 
around, and set them up on the 
course selector. Of course, I got 
good color immediately; and when I 
pressed the fine-tuner the whole 
board turned bright pink, except for 
the rainbow of colors along the 
side. 

There was only one dark line in 
the blue part of the spectrum. 

Well, 1 thought, so much for 
Metchnikov’s theory about danger 
readings. They had lost forty per 
cent of the crew on that mission, 
and that struck me as being quite 
adequately dangerous; but according 
to what he had told me the really 
hairy ones showed six or seven of 
those bands. 

And in the yellow? 

According to Metchnikov, the 
more bright bands in the yellow, the 
more financial reward from a trip. 

Only in this one there were no 
bright bands in the yellow at all. 
There were two thick black “ab- 
sorption” lines. That’s all. 

I thumbed the selector off and sat 
back. So the great brains had la- 
bored and brought forth a mouse 
again: what they had interpreted as 
an indication of safety didn’t really 
mean you were safe, and what they 
had interpreted as a promise of 
good results didn’t seem to have 
any relevance to the first mission in 
more than a year that had really 
come up rich. 

Back to square one, and back to 
being scared. 

For the next couple of days I kept 
GATEWAY 



pretty much to myself. 

There are supposed to be eight 
hundred kilometers of tunnels inside 
Gateway. You wouldn’t think there 
could be that many in a little chunk 
of rock that’s only about ten 
kilometers across. But even so only 
about two per cent of Gateway is 
airspace, the rest is solid rock. I 
saw a lot of those eight hundred 
kilometers. 

I didn’t cut myself off completely 
from human companionship, I just 
didn’t seek it out. I saw Klara now 
and then. I wandered around with 
Shicky when he was off duty, al- 
though it was tiring for him. Some- 
times I wandered by myself, some- 
times with chance-met friends, 
sometimes tagging along after a 
tourist group. The guides knew me 
and were not averse to having me 
along (I had been out! even if I 
didn’t wear a bangle), until they got 
the idea that I was thinking of guid- 
ing myself. Then they were less 
friendly. 

They were right. I was thinking 
of it. I was going to have to do 
something sooner or later. I would 
have to go out, or I would have to 
go home; and if I wanted to defer 
decision on either of those two 
equally frightening prospects, I 
would have to decide at least to try 
to make enough money to stay put. 

When Sheri got out of the hospi- 
tal we had a hell of a party for her, 
a combination of welcome home, 
congratulations and good-by, Sheri, 
because she was leaving for Earth 
the next day. She was shaky but 
cheerful, and although she wasn’t 
up to dancing she sat hugging me in 
the corridor for half an hour, prom- 
ising to miss me. I got quite drunk.

It was a good chance for it; the 
liquor was free. Sheri and her 
Cuban friend were picking up the 
check. In fact, I got so drunk that I 
never did get to say good-by to 
Sheri, because I had to head for the 
toilet and chuck. Drunk as I was, 
that struck me as a pity; it was 
genuine Scotch-from-Scotland 
Gleneagle, none of your local white 
lightning boiled out of God knows 
what. 

Throwing up cleared my head. I 
came out and leaned against a wall, 
my face buried in the ivy, breathing 
hard, and by and by enough oxygen 
got into my bloodstream that I 
could recognize Francy Hereira 
standing next to me. I even said, 
“Hello, Francy.” 

He grinned apologetically. “The 
smell. It was a little strong.” 

“Sorry,” I said huffily, and he 
looked surprised. 

“No, what do you mean? I mean 
it is bad enough on the cruiser, but 
every time I come to Gateway I 
wonder how you live through it. 
And in those rooms — phew!” 

“No offense taken,” I said 
grandly, patting his shoulder. “I 
must say good night to Sheri.” 
“She’s gone. Bob. Got tired. 
They took her back to the hospi- 
tal.” 

“In that case,” 1 said, “I will 
only say good night to you.” I 
bowed and lurched down the tunnel. 
It is difficult being drunk in nearly 
zero gravity. You long for the reas- 
surance of a hundred kilos of solid 
weight to hold you to the ground. I 
understand from what was reported 
to me later, that I pulled a solid 
rack of ivy off the wall, and I know 
from what I felt the next morning

that I bashed my head into some- 
thing hard enough to leave a 
purplish bruise the size of my ear. I 
became conscious of Francy coming 
up behind me and helping me navi- 
gate, and about halfway home I be- 
came conscious that there was 
someone else on my other arm. I 
looked, and it was Klara. 1 have 
only the most confused recollection 
of being put to bed, and when I 
woke up the next morning, desper- 
ately hung over, I was astonished to 
find that Klara was in it too. 

I got up as inconspicuously as I 
could and headed for the bathroom, 
needing a lot to throw up some 
more. It took quite a while, and I 
topped it off with another shower, 
my second in four days and a wild 
extravagance, considering my finan- 
cial state. But I felt a little better, 
and when 1 got back to my room 
Klara had got up, fetched tea, prob- 
ably from Shicky, and was waiting 
for me. 

“Thanks,” I said, meaning it. I 
was infinitely dehydrated. 

“A sip at a time, old horse,” she 
said anxiously, but 1 knew enough 
not to force much into my stomach. 
I managed two swallows and 
stretched out in the hammock again, 
but by then I was pretty sure I 
would live. 

“I didn’t expect to see you 
here,” I said. 

“You were, ah, insistent,” she 
told me. “Not much on perfor- 
mance. But awfully anxious to 
try.” 

“Sony about that.” 

She reached over and squeezed 
my foot. “Not to worry. How’ve 
things been, anyway?” 

“Oh, all right. It was a nice 



party. I don’t remember seeing you 
there?” 

She shrugged. “I came late. 
Wasn’t invited, as a matter of 
fact.” 

I didn’t say anything; I had been 
aware Klara and Sheri were not 
very friendly, and assumed it was 
because of me. Klara, reading my 
mind, said, “I’ve never cared for 
Scorpios, especially unevolved ones 
with that awful huge jaw. Never get 
an intelligent, spiritual thought from 
one of them.” Then she said, to be 
fair, “But she has courage, you 
have to give her that.” 

“I don’t believe I’m up to this 
argument,” I said. 

“Not an argument. Bob.” She 
leaned over, cradling my head. She 
smelled sweaty and female; rather 
nice, in some circumstances, but 
not quite what I wanted right then. 

“Hey,” I said. “What ever be- 
came of musk oil?” 

“What?” 

“I mean,’’ I said, suddenly 
realizing something that had been 
true for quite a while, “you used to 
wear that perfume a lot. That was 
the first thing I remember noticing 
about you.’’ I thought of Francy 
Hereira’s remark about the Gateway 
smell, and realized it had been a 
long time since I had noticed Klara 
smelling particularly nice. 

“Honey-Bob, are you trying to 
start an argument with me?” 

“Certainly not. But I’m curious. 
When did you stop wearing it?” 

She shrugged and didn’t answer, 
unless looking annoyed is an an- 
swer. It was enough of an answer 
for me, because I’d told her often 
enough that I liked the perfume. 
“So how are you doing with your 



GATEWAY 



67 




shrink?” I asked, to change the sub- 
ject. 

It didn’t seem to be any im- 
provement. Klara said, without 
warmth, ‘‘I guess you’re feeling 
pretty rotten with that head. I think 
I’ll go home now.” 

“No, I mean it,” I insisted. 
“I’m curious about your progress.” 
She hadn’t told me a word, though 
I knew she had signed up; and she 
seemed to spend two or three hours 
a day with him. Or it. She had 
elected to try the machine service 
from the Corporation computer, I 
knew. 

“Not bad,” she said distantly. 

“Get over your father fixation 
yet?” I inquired. 

Klara said, “Bob, did it ever 
occur to you that you might get 
some good out of a little help 
yourself?’ ’ 

“Funny you should say that. 
Louise Forehand said the very same 
thing to me the other day.” 

“Not funny. Think about it. See 
you later.” 

I dropped my head back after she 
had gone and closed my eyes. Go 
to a shrink! What did 1 ne^ with 
that? All I needed was one lucky 
find like Sheri’s. 

And all I needed to make that 
was — was — 

Was the guts to sign up for 
another trip. 

But that kind of guts, for me, 
seemed to be in very short supply. 

Time was slipping by, or 1 was 
destroying it, and the way I began 
destroying one day was' to go to the 
museum. They had already installed 
a complete holo set of Sheri’s find. 
I played the disk over two or three 
times, just to see what seventeen 

68 



million five hundred and fifty 
thousand dollars looked like. It 
mostly looked like irrelevant junk. 
That was when each piece was dis- 
played on its own. There were 
about ten little prayer fans, proving, 
I guess, that the Heechee liked to 
include a few art objects even with 
a tire-repair kit. Or whatever the 
rest of it was; things like triangle- 
bladed screwdrivers with flexible 
shafts, things like socket wrenches, 
but made of some soft material; 
things like electrical test probes, 
and things like nothing you ever 
saw before. Spread out item by item 
they seemed pretty random, but the 
way they fit into each other, and 
into the flat nested boxes that made 
up the set, was a marvel of packing 
economy. Seventeen million five 
hundred and fifty thousand dollars, 
and if I had stayed with Sheri I 
could have been one of the 
shareholders. 

Or one of the corpses. 

I stopped off at Klara’s place and 
hung around for a while, but she 
wasn’t home. It wasn’t her usual 
time for being shrunk. On the other 
hand, I had lost track of Klara’s 
usual times. She had found another 
kid to mother when its parents were 
busy: a little black girl, maybe four 
years old, who had come up with a 
mother who was an astrophysicist 
and a father who was an 
exobiologist. And what else Klara 
had found to keep herself busy I 
was not sure. 

I drifted back to my own room, 
and Louise Forehand peered out of 
her door and followed me in. 
“Bob,” she said urgently, “do you 
know anything about a big danger 
bonus coming up?”

I made room for her on the pad. 
“Me? No. Why would I?” Her 
pale, muscular face was tauter than 
ever, I could not tell why. 

“I thought maybe you’d heard 
something. From Dane Metchnikov, 
maybe. I know you’re close to him, 
and I’ve seen him talking to Klara 
in the schoolroom.’’ I didn’t re- 
spond to that, I wasn’t sure what I 
wanted to say. “There’s a rumor 
that there’s a science trip coming up 
that’s pretty hairy. And I’d like to 
sign on for it.’’ 

I put my arm around her. 
“What’s the matter, Louise?’’ 

“They posted Willa dead.’’ 

I held her for a while and let her 
cry it out. I would have comforted 
her if I had known how, but what 
comfort was there to give? After a 
while I got up and rummaged 
around in my cupboard, looking for 
a joint Klara had left there a couple 
days before. I found it, lighted it, 
passed it to her. 

GATEWAY 



Louise took a long, hard pull, 
and held it for quite a while. Then 
she puffed out. “She’s dead. Bob,” 
she said. She was over crying now, 
somber but relaxed; even the mus- 
cles around her neck and up and 
down her spine were tension- free. 

“She might come back yet, 
Louise.” 

She shook her head. “Not really. 
The Corporation posted her ship 
lost. It might come back, maybe. 
Willa won’t be alive in it. Their last 
stretch of rations would have run 
out two weeks ago.” She stared 
into space for a moment, then 
sighed and roused herself to take 
another pull on the Joint. “I wish 
Sess were here,” she said, leaning 
back and stretching; I could feel the 
play of muscles against the palm of 
my hand. 

The dope was hitting her, I could 
see. I knew it was hitting me. It 
wasn’t any of our usual Gateway 
windowbox stuff, sneaked in among 
the ivy. Klara had got hold of some 
pure Naples Red from one of the 
cruiser boys, shadegrown on the 
slopes of Mount Vesuvius between 
the rows of vines that made Lac- 
rimae Cristi wine. She turned to- 
ward me and snuggled her chin into 
my neck. “I really love my fami- 
ly,” she said, calmly enough. “I 
wish we had hit lucky here. We’re 
about due for some luck.” 

“Hush, honey,” I said, nuzzling 
into her hair. Her hair led to her ear 
and her ear led to her lips, and step 
by step we were making love in a 
timeless, gentle, stoned way. It was 
very relaxed. Louise was compe- 
tent, unanxious and accepting. After 
a couple of months of Klara’s ner- 
vous paroxysms it was like coming 

69 




home to Mom’s chicken soup. At 
the end she smiled, kissed me and 
turned away. She was very still, 
and her breathing was even. She lay 
silent for a long time, and it wasn’t 
until I realized that my wrist was 
getting damp that I knew she was 
crying again. 

“I’m sorryj Bob,” she said when 
I began to pat her. “It’s just that 
we’ve never had any luck. Some 
days I can live with that fact, and 
some days not. This is one of the 
bad ones.” 

“You will.” 

“I don’t think so. I don’t believe 
it any more.” 

“You got here, didn’t you? 
That’s pretty lucky.” 

She twisted herself around to face 
me, her eyes scanning mine. I said, 
“I mean, think of how many billion 
people would give their left testicles 
to be here.” 

Louise said slowly, “Bob — ” 
She stopped. I started to speak but 
she put her hand over my lips. 
“Bob,” she said, “do you know 
how we managed to get here?” 
“Sure. Sess sold his airbody.” 
“We sold more than that. The 
airbody brought a little over a 
hundred thousand. That wasn’t 
enough for even one of us. We got 
the money from Hat.” 

“Your son? the one that died?” 
She said, “Hat had a brain 
tumor. They caught it in time, or 
anyway almost in time. It was oper- 
able. He could have lived, oh, I 
don’t know, ten years anyway. He 
would have been messed up some. 
His speech centers were affected, 
and so was his muscle control. But 
he could have been alive right now. 
Only — ” She took her hand off my 

70 



chest to rub it across her face, but 
she wasn’t crying. “He didn’t want 
us to spend the airbody money on 
Term Medical for him. It would 
have just about paid for the surgery, 
and then we would have been broke 
again. So what he did, he sold him- 
self, Bob. He sold off all his parts. 
More than just a left testicle. All of 
him. They were fine, first-quality 
Nordic male twenty-two-year-old 
parts, and they were worth a bun- 
dle. He signed himself over to the 
medics and they — how do you say 
it? — put him to sleep. There must 
be pieces of Hat in a dozen differ- 
ent people now. They sold off ev- 
erything for transplants, and they 
gave us the money. Close to a mil- 
lion dollars. Got us here, with some 
to spare. So that’s where our luck 
came from. Bob.” 

I said, “I’m sorry.” 

“For what? We just don’t have 
the luck. Bob. Hat’s dead. Willa’s 
dead. God knows where my hus- 
band is, or our one last surviving 
kid. And I’m here, and. Bob, half 
the time I wish with all my heart 
that I were dead too.” 

* * * 

I left her sleeping in my bed and 
wandered down to Central Park. I 
called Klara, found her out, left a 
message to say where I was, and 
spent the next hour or so on my 
back, looking up at the mulberries 
ripening on the tree. There was no 
one there except for a couple of 
tourists taking a fast look through 
before their ship left. I didn’t pay 
attention to them, didn’t even hear 
them leave. I was feeling sorry for 
Louise and for all the Forehands, 



GALAXY 




and even sorrier for myself. They 
didn’t have the luck, but what I 
didn’t have hurt a lot more; I didn’t 
have the courage to see where my 
luck would take me. Sick societies 
squeeze adventurers out like grape 
pips. The grape pips don’t have 
much to say about it. I suppose it 
was the same with Columbus’s 
seamen or the pioneers manhandling 
their covered wagons through Com- 
anche territory; they must have been 
scared witless, like me, but they 
didn’t have much choice. Like me. 
But, God, how frightened I 
was. 

I heard voices, a child’s and a 
light, slower laugh that was Klara’s. 
I sat up. 

“Hello, Bob,’’ she said, standing 
before me with her hand on the 
head of a tiny black girl in corn-row 
hair. “This is Watty.” 

“Hello, Watty.” 

My voice didn’t sound right, 
even to me. Klara took a closer 
look and demanded, “What’s the 
matter?” 

I couldn’t answer that question in 
one sentence so I chose one facet. 
“Willa Forehand’s been posted 
dead.” 

Klara nodded without saying any- 
thing. Watty piped, “Please, Klara. 
Throw the ball.” Klara tossed it to 
her, caught it, tossed it again, all in 
the Gagetway adagio. 

I said, “Louise wants to go on a 
danger-lx)nus launch. I thii^ what 
she wants is for me, for us, to go 
and take her with us.” 

“Oh?” 

“Well, what about it? Has Dane 
said anything to you about one of 
his specials?” 

“No! I haven’t seen Dane for — I 



don’t know. Anyway, he shipped 
out this morning on a One.” 

“He didn’t have a farewell 
party!” I protested, surprised. She 
pursed her lips. The little girl 
called: 

“Hey, mister! Catch!” When she 
threw the ball it came floating up 
like a hot-air balloon to a mooring 
mast, but even so I almost missed 
■it. My mind was on something else. 
I tossed it b’ack with concentration. 

After a minute Klara said, “Bob? 
I’m sorry. I guess I was in a bad 
mood.” 

“Yeah.” My mind was very 
busy. 

She said placatingly, “We’ve 
been having some hard times. Bob. 
I don’t want to be raspy with you. 
1 — I brought you something.” 

I looked around, and she took my 
hand and slid something up over it, 
onto my arm. 

It was a launch bracelet, Heechee 
metal, worth five hundred dollars 
anywhere. I hadn’t been able to af- 
ford to buy one. I stared at it, try- 
ing to think of what I wanted to 
say. 

“Bob?” 

“What?” 

There was an edge to her voice. 
“It’s customary to say thank you.” 

“It’s customary,” I said, “to 
give a truthful answer to a question. 
Like not saying you hadn’t seen 
Dane Metchnikov when you were 
with him just last night.” 

She flared, “You’ve been spying 
on me!” 

“You’ve been lying to me.” 

“Bob! You don’t own me. 
Dane’s a human being, and a 
friend.” 

“Friend!” I barked. The last

A NOTE ON METALLURGY 

Question. I saw a report that 
Heechee metal had been 
analyzed by the National Bureau 
of Standards — 

Prof. Hegramet. No you didn't. 

Question. But it was on the 
PV— 

Prof. Hegramet. No. You saw a 
report that the Bureau of Stan- 
dards had issued a quantitative 
assessment of Heechee metal. Not 
an analysis. Just a description: 
tensile strength, fracture strength, 
melting point, all that stuff. 

Question. I'm not sure I under- 
stand the difference. 

Prof. Hegramet. We finally 
know exactly what it does. We 
don't yet know what it is. What's 
the most interesting thing about 
Heechee metal? You, Teri? 

Question. It glows? 

Prof. Hegramet. It glows, yes. It 
emits light. Bright enough so that 
we don't need anything else to 
light our rooms, we have to cover 
it over when we want dark. And 
it's been glowing for half a mil- 
lion years at least like that. Where 
does the energy come from? The 
Bureau says there are some post- 
uranic elements in it, and prob- 
ably they drive the radiation; but 
we don't know what they are. 
There's also something in it that 
looks like an isotope of copper. 
Well, copper doesn't have any 
stable isotopes. Up to now. So 
what the Bureau says is what the 
exact frequency of the blue light 
is, and all the physical measure- 
ments to eight or nine decimals; 
but the report doesn't tell you 
how to make any. 



thing Metchnikov was to anyone 
was a friend. Just thinking about 
Klara with him made my groin 
crawl. 1 didn’t like the sensation, 
because I couldn’t identify it. It 
wasn’t just anger, wasn’t even Just 
jealousy. There was a component 
that remained obstinately opaque. I 
said, knowing it was illogical, hear- 
ing myself seem almost to whine. 
“I intnxluced you to him!” 

“That doesn’t give you owner- 
ship! All right,’’ Klara snarled, 
“maybe 1 went to bed with him a 
few times. It doesn’t change how I 
feel about you.” 

“It changes how I feel about 
you, Klara.” 

She stared incredulously. “You 
have the nerve to say that? Coming 
here, smelling of sex with some 
cheap floozy?” 

That one caught me off guard. 
“There was nothing cheap about it! 
I was comforting someone in pain.” 

She laughed. The sound was un- 
pleasant; anger is unbecoming. 
“Louise Forehand? She hustled her 
way up here, did you know that?” 

The little girl was holding the 
ball and staring at us now. I could 
see we were frightening her. I said, 
trying to tighten my voice to keep 
the anger from spilling out, “Klara, 
I’m not going to let you make a 
fool out of me.” 

“Ah,” she said in inarticulate 
disgust, and turned around to go. I 
reached out to touch her, and she 
sobbed and hit me, as hard as she 
could. The blow caught me on the 
shoulder. 

That was a mistake. 

That’s always a mistake. It isn’t a 
matter of what’s rational or jus- 
tified, it is a matter of signals. It 



72 



GALAXY 




was the wrong signal to give me. 
The reason wolves don’t kill each 
other off is that the smaller and 
weaker wolf always surrenders. It 
rolls over, bares its throat and puts 
its paws in the air to signal that it is 
beaten. When that happens the win- 
ner is physically unable to attack 
any more. If it were not that way, 
there wouldn’t be any wolves left. 
For the same reason men don’t usu- 
ally kill women, or not by beating 
them to death. They can’t. However 
much he wants to hit her, his inter- 
nal machinery vetoes it. But if the 
woman makes the mistake of giving 
him a different signal by hitting him 
first — 

1 punched her four or five times, 
as hard as I could, on the breast, in 
the face, in the belly. She fell to the 
ground, sobbing. I knelt beside her, 
lifted her up with one hand and, in 
absolutely cold blood, slapped her 
twice more. It was all happening as 
if choreographed by God, absolutely 
inevitably; and at the same time I 
could feel that I was breathing as 
hard as though I’d climbed a moun- 
tain on a dead run. The blood was 
thundering in my ears. Everything I 
saw was hazed with red. 

I finally heard a distant, thin cry- 
ing. 

I looked and saw the little girl, 
Watty, staring at me, her mouth 
open, tears rolling down her wide, 
purplish-black cheeks. I started to 
move toward her to reassure her. 
She screamed and ran behind a 
grape trellis. 

1 turned back toward Klara, who 
was sitting up, not looking at me, 
her hand cupped over her mouth. 
She took the hand away and stared 
at something in it: a tooth.

I didn’t say anything. I didn’t 
know what to say, and didn’t trust 
myself to think of anything. 1 
turned and left. 

I don’t remember what I did for 
the next few hours. 

I didn’t sleep, although I was 
physically exhausted. 1 sat on the 
chest of drawers in my room for a 
while. Then I left it again. I re- 
member talking to somebody, 1 
think it was a straggling tourist off 
the Venus ship, about how adven- 
turous and exciting prospecting was. 
I remember eating something in the 
commissary. And all the time 1 was 
thinking: I wanted to kill Klara. I 
had been containing all that stored- 
up fury, and I hadn’t even let my- 
self know it was there until she 
pulled the trigger. 

1 'didn’t know if she would ever 
forgive me. I wasn’t sure she ought 
to, and I wasn’t even sure that I 
wanted her to. I could not imagine 
our ever being lovers again. But 
what 1 finally was sure I wanted 
was to apologize. 

Only she wasn’t in her rooms. 
There was no one there but a plump 
young black woman, slowly sorting 
out clothes, with a tragic face. 
When I asked after Klara she began 
to cry. “She’s gone,” the woman 
sobbed. 

“Gone?” 

“Oh, she looked awful. Someone 
must have beaten her up! She 
brought Watty back and said she 
wouldn’t be able to take care of her 
any more. She gave me all her 
clothes, but — what am I going to do 
with Watty when I’m working?” 

“Gone where?” 

The woman lifted her head. 
“Back to Venus. On the ship. It 

73 




left an hour ago.” 

Somehow I got to sleep, alone in 
my own bed. I didn’t talk to anyone 
else. 

When I got up I gathered together 
everything I owned: My clothes, my 
holodisks, my chess set, my 
wristwatch. The Heechee bracelet 
that Klara had given me. 1 went 
around and sold them off. I cleaned 
out my credit account and put all 
the money together: it came to a 
total of fourteen hundred dollars and 
change. 1 took the money up to the 
casino and put it all on Number 31 
on the roulette wheel. 

The big slow ball drifted into a 
socket: Green. Zero. 

1 went down to mission control 
and signed for the first One that 
was available, and twenty-four 
hours later I was in space.

“How do you really feel about 
Dane, Bob?” 

“How the hell do you think 1 
feel? He seduced my girl.” 

“That’s a strangely old-fashioned 
way to put it. Bob. And it happened 
an awfully long time ago.” 

“Sure it did.” Sigfrid strikes me 
as being unfair. He sets up rules, 
then he doesn’t play by them. I say 
indignantly, “Cut it out, Sigfrid. 
All that happened a long time ago, 
but it isn’t being a long time ago, 
for me, because I’ve never let it 
come out. It’s still brand-new inside 
my head. Isn’t that what you’re 
supposed to do for me? Let all that 
old stuff inside my head come out 
so it can dry up and blow away and 
not cripple me any more?” 

“I’d still like to know why it 



stays so brand-new inside your 
head. Bob.” 

“Oh, Christ, Sigfrid!” This is 
one of Sigfrid’s stupid times. He 
can’t handle some complex kinds of 
input, 1 guess. When you come 
right down to it he’s only a machine 
and can’t do anything he isn’t pro- 
grammed to do. Mostly he just re- 
sponds to key words — well, with a 
little attention to meaning, sure. 
And to nuance, as far as it is ex- 
pressed by voice tone, or by what 
the sensors in the pad and straps tell 
him about my muscle activity. 

“If you were a person instead of 
a machine, you’d understand,” I 
tell him. 

“Perhaps so. Bob.” 

To get him back on the right 
track I say: “It is true that it hap- 
pened a long time ago. I don’t see 
what you’re asking beyond that.” 
“I’m asking you to resolve a con- 
tradiction I perceive in what you 
say. You’ve been saying that you 
don’t mind the fact that your girl 
friend, Klara, had sexual relations 
with other men. Why is it so impor- 
tant that she did with Dane?’ ’ 

“Dane didn’t treat her right!” 
And, good God, he certainly didn’t. 
He left her stuck like a fly in 
amber. 

“Is it because of how he treated 
Klara, Bob? Or is it something be- 
tween Dane and you?” 

“Never! There was never any- 
thing between Dane and me!” 

“You did tell me he was bi. 
Bob. What about on the flight you 
took with him.” 

“He had two other men to play 
with! Not me, boy, no, I swear! 
Not me. Oh,” I said, trying to calm 
my voice enough to m^e it reflect

the very mild interest I really felt in 
this stupid subject, “to be sure, he 
tried to put the make on me once or 
twice. But I told him it wasn’t my 
style.” 

“Your voice. Bob,” he says, 
“seems to reflect more anger than 
your words account for.” 

‘‘Damn you, Sigfrid!” I really 
am angry now, 1 admit it. 1 can 
hardly get the words out. “You get 
me pissed off with your wild ac- 
cusations. Sure, 1 let him put his 
arm around me once or twice. 
That’s as far as 1 went. Nothing 
serious. 1 was Just abusing myself 
to make the time pass. 1 liked him 
well enough. Big, goodlooking fel- 
low. You get lonesome when — Now 
what?” 

Sigfrid was making a sound, sort 
of like clearing one’s throat. It is 
how he interrupts without interrupt- 
ing. “What did you Just say. 
Bob?” 

“What? When?” 

“When you said there was noth- 
ing serious between you.” 

“Christ, I don’t know what I 
said. There was nothing serious, 
that’s all. I was Just entertaining 
myself, to make the time pass.” 

“You didn’t use the word ‘enter- 
taining’, Bob.” 

“I didn’t? What word did I 
use?” 

I reflect, listening for the echo of 
my own voice. “I guess I said 
‘amusing myself. What about it?” 

“You didn’t say ‘amusing’ 
either. Bob. What did you say?” 

“1 don’t know!” 

“You said, ‘I was just abusing 
myself’. Bob.” 

My defenses go up, I feel as 
though I had suddenly discovered I

Sigfrid doesn’t respond to my ur-

in it for a minute. 

“All right,” I say. I feel very 
open and vulnerable, letting nothing 
at all happen, living in that moment 
as though it were lasting forever, 
like Klara stuck in her instant and 
eternal fall. 

Sigfrid says gently, “Bob. When 
you masturbated, did you ever have

I was just turning over, making 
up my mind to go to sleep, when I 
noticed that the colors on the 
Heechee guidance system were 
breaking up. It was the fifty-fifth 
day of my trip, the twenty-seventh 
since turnover. The colors had been 
shocking pink for the whole fifty- 
five days. Now whorls of pure 
white formed, grew, clotted to- 
gether. 

I was arriving! Wherever it was 
going to turn out to be when I got 
there, I was arriving. 

My little old ship — the smelly, 
hurtful, tedious coffin I had been 
banging around in for nearly two 
months by myself, talking to my- 
self, playing games with myself, 
tired of myself — was well below 
lightspeed. I leaned over to look at 
the viewscreen, now relatively 
“down” to me because I had been 

76 



decelerating, and saw nothing that 
looked very exciting. Oh, there was 
a star, yes. There were lots of stars 
in a scattering of groupings that in 
no way looked familiar; half a 
dozen blues ranging from bright to 
hurt-the-eyes; a red one that stood 
out more for intensity of hue than 
luminosity. It was an angry-looking 
red coal, not much brighter than 
Mars is from Earth, but a deeper, 
uglier red. 

I made myself take an interest. 

That was not really easy. After 
fifty-seven days of rejecting every- 
thing around me because it was bor- 
ing or threatening, it was hard for 
me to switch over to a welcoming, 
vulnerable mode. I switched on the 
spherical scan and peered out as the 
ship began to rotate in its scanning 
pattern, slicing orange-peel strips of 
sky to capture in the cameras and 
analyzers. 

And almost at once I got a huge, 
bright, nearby signal return. 

Fifty-seven days of boredom and 
exhaustion went right out of my 
mind. There was something either 
very big or very close. I forgot 
about being sleepy. I crouched over 
the viewscreen, holding on with 
hands and knees, and then I saw it: 
a squared-off object marching into 
the screen. Glowing all over. Pure 
Heechee metal! It was irregularly 
slab-sided, wit4i rounded pimples 
studding one of the flat sides. 

And the adrenalin began to flow, 
and visions of sugarplums danced in 
my head. I watched it out of sight, 
and then hauled myself over to the 
scan analyzer, waiting to see what 
would come out. There was no 
question that it was good, the only 
question was /tow good. Maybe ex- 

GALAXY 




traordinarily good! Maybe a whole 
Peggy’s Worid all my own! — with a 
royalty in the millions of dollars 
every year all the rest of my life! 
Maybe only a vacant shell. 
Maybe — the squared-off shape 
suggested it — maybe that wildest of 
dreams, a whole big Heechee ship 
that I could enter into and fly 
around anywhere I chose, big 
enough to carry a thousand people 
and a million tons of cargo! All 
those dreams were possible; and 
even if they all failed, if it was just 
an abandoned shell, all that it 
needed was one thing inside it, one 
little tinkertoy, one gadget, one 
whozie that nobody had ever found 
before that could be taken apart and 
reproduced and made to work — 

I stumbled and raked my knuck- 
les against the spiral gadget, now 
glowing soft gold. I sucked the 
blood off them and realized the ship 
was moving. 

It shouldn’t have been moving! It 
wasn’t programmed to do that. It 
was meant to hang in whatever orbit 
it was programmed to find, and just 
stay there until I looked around and 
made my decisions. 

I stared around, confused and 
baffled. The glowing slab was 
firmly in the middle of the view- 
screen now and it stayed there; the 
ship had stopped its automatic 
spherical scan. Belatedly 1 heard the 
distant high yell of the lander 
motors. They were what were mov- 
ing me; my ship was targeted for 
that slab. 

And a green light was glowing 
over the pilot’s seat. 

That was wrong! The green light 
was installed on Gateway by human 
beings. It had nothing to do with

the Heechee; it was the plain old 
people’s radio circuit, announcing 
that someone was calling me. Who? 
Who could be anywhere near my 
brand-new discovery? 

I thumbed on the TBS circuit and 
shouted, “Hello?” 

There was an answer. I didn’t 
understand it; it seemed to be in 
some foreign language, perhaps 
Chinese. But it was human all right. 
“Talk English!” I yelled. “Who 
the hell are you?” 

Pause. Then another voice. 
“Who are youT’ 

“My name is Broadhead,” I 
snarled. 

“Broadhead?” Confused mum- 
bling of a couple of voices. Then 
the English-speaking voice again: 
“We don’t have any record of a 
prospector named Broadhead. Are 
you from Aphrodite?” 

“What’s Aphrodite?” 

“Oh, Christ! Who are you? Lis- 
ten, this is Gateway Two control 
and we don’t have time to screw 
around. Identify yourself!” 

Gateway Two! 



GALAXY 




I snapped off the radio and lay 
back, watching the slab grow 
larger, ignoring the demand of the 
green light. Gateway Two? How 
ridiculous! If I had wanted to go to 
Gateway Two I would have signed 
up in the regular course and ac- 
cepted the penalty of paying royal- 
ties on anything 1 might find. 1 
would have flown out secure as any 
tourist, on a course that had been 
tested a hundred times. I hadn’t 
done that. I had picked a setting no 
one else had ever used, and taken 
my risks. And I had felt every one 
of them, scared out of my brain for 
fifty-seven bad days. 

It wasn’t fair! 

I lost my head. 1 lunged toward 
the Heechee course director and 
shoved the wheels around at ran- 
dom. 

It was a failure I couldn’t accept. 
I was braced to find nothing. I was 
not braced to find I had done some- 
thing easy, for no reward at all. 

But what I produced was a bigger 
failure still. There was a bright yel- 
low flash from the course board, 
and then all the colors went black. 

The thin scream from the lander 
motors stopped. 

The feeling of motion was gone. 
The ship was dead. Nothing was 
moving. Nothing worked in the 
Heechee complex; nothing, not even 
the cooling system. 

By the time Gateway Two sent a 
ship out to haul me in I was deliri- 
ous with heatstroke, in an ambient 
temperature of 75°C. 

Gateway was hot and dank. 
Gateway Two was cold enough that 
I had to borrow jacket, gloves and 
heavy underwear. Gateway stank of 
sweat and sewers. Gateway Two 

GATEWAY 



tasted of rusty steel. Gateway was 
bright and lopd and full of people. 
On Gateway Two there was almost 
no sound, and only seven human 
beings, not counting myself, to 
make any. The Heechee had left 
Gateway Two not quite completed. 
Some of the tunnels ended in bare 
rock, and there were only a few 
dozen of them. No one had got 
around to planting vegetation yet, 
and all the air there was came from 
chemical processors; the partial 
pressure of O 2 was under 150 mil- 
libars, and the rest of the atmo- 
sphere was a nitrogen-helium mix, 
not much more than half earth- 
normal pressure altogether, that 
made the voices highpitched and 
left me gasping for the first few 
hours. 

The man who helped me out of 
my lander and bundled me up 
against the sudden cold was a daik, 
immense Martian-Japanese named 
Norio Ituno. He put me in his own 
bed, filled me with liquids and let 
me rest for an hour. I dozed, and 
when I woke up he was sitting 
there, looking at me with amuse- 
ment and respect. The respect was 
for someone who had slain a five- 
hundred-million-dollar ship. The 
amusement was that I was idiot 
enough to do it. 

“I guess I’m in trouble,” I said. 

‘‘I would say so, yes,” he 
agreed. “The ship is totally dead. 
Never saw anything like it before.” 

“I didn’t know a Heechee ship 
could go dead like that.” 

He shrugged. ‘‘You did some- 
thing origin^, Broadhead. How are 
you feeling?” I sat up to answer 
him, and he nodded. “We’re pretty 
busy right now. I’m going to have

to let you take care of yourself for a 
couple of hours — if you can? — fine. 
Then we’ll have a party for you.” 
“Party!” It was the farthest thing 
from my mind. “For what?” 

“We don’t meet someone like 
you every day, Broadhead,” he said 
admiringly, and left me to my 
thoughts. 

1 didn’t like my thoughts very 
mudh, and after a while I got up, 
put on the gloves, buttoned up the 
jacket and started exploring. It 

BO 



didn’t take long; there wasn’t much 
there. I heard sounds of activity 
from the lower levels, but the 
echoes traveled at queer angles 
along the empty corridors and I saw 
no one. Gateway Two didn’t have a 
tourist trade, and so there wasn’t 
any night club or casino, no restau- 
rant that I could find ... not even 
a latrine. After a little while that 
question began to seem urgent. 1 
reasoned that Ituno would have had 
to have something like that near his 
room, and tried to retrace my steps 
to there, but that didn’t work either. 
There were cubicles along some of 
the corridors, but they were un- 
finished. No one lived there, and no 
one had troubled to install plumb- 
ing. 

It was not one of my better days. 

When I finally found a toilet 1 
puzzled over it for ten minutes and 
would guiltily have left it impolitely 
soiled if I had not heard a sound 
outside the cubicle. A plump little 
woman was standing there, waiting. 

“I don’t know how to flush it,” 1 
apologized. 

She looked me up and down. 
“You’re Broadhead,” she stated, 
and then: “Why don’t you go to 
Aphrodite?’ ’ 

“What’s Aphrodite — no, wait. 
First, how do you flush this thing? 
Then, what’s Aphrodite?” 

She pointed to a button on the 
edge of the door; I had thought it 
was a light switch. When 1 touched 
it the whole bottom of the seamless 
bowl began to glow and in ten sec- 
onds there was nothing inside but 
ash, then nothing at all. “Wait for 
me,” she commanded, disappearing 
inside. When she came out she said: 

“Aphrodite’s where the money 



GALAXY 




is, Broadhead. You’re going to 
need it.” 

I let her take my arm and pull me 
along. Aphrodite, I began to under- 
stand, was a planet. A new one, 
that a ship from Gateway Two had 
opened up less than forty days ear- 
lier, and a big one. “You’d have to 
pay royalty, of course,” she said. 
“And so far they haven’t found 
anything hig, just the usual Heechee 
debris. But there’s thousands of 
square miles to explore, and it’ll be 
two months before the first batch of 
prospectors starts coming out from 
Gateway. We only sent the word 
back forty days ago. Have you had 
any hot-planet experience?” 
“Hot-planet experience?” 

“1 mean,” she explained, pulling 
me down a drop-shaft and calling 
up to me, “have you ever explored 
a planet that’s hot?” 

“ — No. As a matter of fact, 1 
haven’t had any exp>erience at all, 
that counts for anything. One trip. 
Empty. I didn’t even land.” 

“Pity,” she said. “Still, there’s 
not that much to learn. You know 
what Venus is like? Aphrodite’s just 
a little bit worse. The primary’s a 
flare star, and you don’t want to be 
caught in the open. But the Heechee 
digs are all underground. If you 
find one, you’re in.” 

“What are the chances of finding 
one?” I asked. 

“Well,” she said thoughtfully, 
pulling me off the cable and down a 
tunnel, “not all that good, maybe. 
After all, you’re out in the open 
when you’re prosp>ecting. On Venus 
they use armored airbodies and they 
zap around anywhere they want to 
go, no trouble. Well, maybe a little 
trouble,” she conceded. “But they

don’t lose very many prospectors 
any more. Maybe one p>er cent.” 
“What per cent do you lose on 
Aphrodite?’ ’ 

“More than that. Yes, I grant 
you, it’s higher than that. You have 
to use the lander from your ship, 
and of course it’s not very mobile 
on the surface of a planet. Espe- 
cially a planet with a surface like 
molten sulfur and winds like

“It sounds charming,” I said. 
“Why aren’t you out there now?” 
“Me? I’m an outpilot. I’m going 
back to Gateway in about ten days, 
soon as I get a cargo loaded, or 
somebody comes in and wants a 
ride back.” 

“I want a ride back right now.” 
“Oh, cripes, Broadhead! Don’t 
you know what kind of trouble 
you’re in? You broke regulations by 
messing with the control board. 
They’ll throw the book at you.” 

I thought it over carefully. Then I

if I can take one. I think I have the 
guts to get back to Gateway. Be- 
yond that, I don’t know.” 

★ ★ ★ 

I was on Gateway Two, al- 
together, thirteen days. Hester Ber- 
gowiz, the outpilot, kept trying to 
talk me into going to Aphrodite, I 
guess because she didn’t want me 
taking up valuable cargo space on 
her return flight. The others didn’t 
care. They only thought I was 
crazy. 1 was a problem for Ituno, 
who was loosely in charge of keep- 
ing things straight on Two. Techni- 
cally I was an illegal entrant, with- 
out a dime’s worth of per capita 
paid and with nothing to pay it 
with. He would have been within 
his rights to toss me out into space 
without a suit. He solved it by put- 
ting me to work loading low- 
priority cargo into Hester’s Five, 
mostly prayer fans and samples for 
analysis from Aphrodite. That took 
two days, and then he designated 
me a chief gofer for the three 
people who were rebuilding suits 
for the next batch of explorers of 
Aphrodite. They had to use 
Heechee torches to soften the metal 
enough to bend it onto the suits, 
and I wasn’t trusted with any of 
that. It takes two years to train a 
person to handle a Heechee torch in 
close quarters. But I was allowed to 
muscle the suits and sheets of 



Heechee metal into position for 
them, to fetch tools, to go for cof- 
fee . and to put the suits on 
when they were finished, and exit 
into space to make sure they didn’t 
leak. 

None of them leaked. 

On the twelfth day two Fives 
came in from Gateway, loaded with 
happy, eager prospectors bringing 
all the wrong equipment. The word 
about Aphrodite had not had time to 
get to Gateway and back, so the 
new fish didn’t know what goodies 
were in store. Just by accident, one 
of them was a young girl on a sci- 
ence mission, a former student of 
Professor Hegramet’s who was sup- 
posed to make anthropometric 
studies of Gateway Two. On his 
own authority Norio Ituno reas- 
signed her to Aphrodite, and de- 
creed a combination welcome and 
farewell party. The ten newcomers 
and I outnumbered our hosts, but 
what they lacked in numbers they 
made up in drinking and it was a 
good party. I found myself a celeb- 
rity. 

The new fish couldn’t get over 
the fact that I had slain a Heechee 
ship and survived. 

I was almost sorry to 
leave . not counting being 
scared. 

Ituno splashed three fingers of 
rice whiskey into a glass for me and 
offered me a toast. “Sorry to see 
you go, Broadhead,’’ he said. 
“Sure you won’t change your 
mind? We’ve got more armored 
ships and suits than we have pros- 
pectors right now, but 1 don’t know 
how long that’s going to last. If you 
change your mind after you get 
back — ”

“I’m not going to change my 
mind,” I said. 

“Banzai,” he said, and drank. 
“Listen, do you know an old guy 
named Bakin?” 

“Shicky? Sure. My neighbor.” 
“Give him my regards,” he said, 
pouring another drink for the pur- 
pose. “He’s a great guy, but he 
reminds me of you. I was with him 
when he lost his legs: got caught in 
the lander when we had to jettison. 
Damn near died. By the time we 
got him to Gateway he was all 
swelled up and smelled like hell; we 
had to take the legs off, two days 
out. I did it myself.” 

“He’s a great person, all right,” 
I said absently, rinishing the drink 
and holding the glass out for more. 
“Hey. What do you mean, he re- 
minds you of me?” 

“Can’t make up his mind, 
Broadhead. He’s got a stake that’s 
enough to put him on Full Medical, 
and he can’t make up his mind to 
spend it. If he spends it he can have 
his legs back and go out again. But 
then he’d be broke if he didn’t 
score. So he Just stays on, a crip- 
ple.” 

I put the glass down. 1 didn’t 
want any more to drink. “So long, 
Ituno,” 1 said. “I’m going to bed.” 
I spent most of the trip back writ- 
ing letters to Klara that I didn’t 
know if 1 would ever mail. There 
wasn’t much else to do. Hester 
turned out to be surprisingly sexual, 
for a small plump lady of a certain 
age, but there’s a limit to how long 
that is entertaining and with all the 
cargo we had jammed in the ship 
there wasn’t room for much else. 
The days were all the same: sex, 
letter writing, sleeping . and

Sigfrid says, “You sound tired, 
Bob.” 

Well, that was understandable 
enough. I had gone off to Hawaii 
for the weekend. Some of my 
money was in tourism there, so it 
was all tax deductible. It was a 
lovely couple of days on the Big Is- 
land, with a two-hour stockholders’ 
meeting in the morning, and af- 
ternoons with one of those beautiful 
Island girls on the beach or sailing 
in glass-bottomed catamarans, 
watching the big mantas glide un- 
derneath begging for crumbs. But 
coming back you fight time zones 
all the way, and I was exhausted. 

Only that is not the sort of thing 
that Sigfrid really wants to hear 

83 




about. He doesn’t care if you’re 
physically exhausted. He doesn’t 
care if you’ve got a broken leg, he 
only wants to know if you dream 
about screwing your mother. 

I say that. 1 say, “I’m tired, all 
right, Sigfrid, but why don’t you 
stop making small talk? Get right 
into my Oedipal feelings about 
Ma.” 

“Did you have any, Bobby?’’ 
“Doesn’t everybody?’’ 

“Do you want to talk about 
them, Bobby?’’ 

“Not particularly.’’ 

He waits, and I wait too. Sigfrid 
has been being cute again, and now 
his room is fixed up like a boy’s 
room from forty years ago. Crossed 
pingpong paddles hologrammed on 
the wall. A fake window with a 
fake view of the Montana Rockies 
in a snowstorm. A hologrammed 
cassette shelf of boys’ stories on 
tape, Tom Sawyer and Lost Race of 
Mars and — I can’t read the rest of 
the titles. It is all very homey, but 
not in the least like my own room 
as a boy, which was tiny, narrow 
and almost filled by the old sofa I 
slept on. 

“Do you know what you do want 
to talk about, Rob?’’ Sigfrid probes 
gently. 

“You bet.’’ Then I reconsider. 
“Well, no. I’m not sure.’’ Actually 
I do know. Something had hit me 
on the way back from Hawaii, very 
hard. It’s a five-hour flight. Half 
the time I had spent drenched in 
tears. It was funny. There was this 
lovely hapi-haole girl flying east in 
the seat next to me, and I had de- 
cided right away to get to know her 
better. And the stewardess was the 
same one I’d had before, and she I 

84 



already knew better. 

So there I was, sitting at the very 
back of the first-class section of the 
SST, taking drinks from the 
stewardess, chatting with my pretty 
hapi-haole. And — every time the 
girl was drowsing, or in the ladies’ 
room, and the stewardess was look- 
ing the other way — racked with si- 
lent, immense, tearful sobs. 

And then one of them would look 
my way again and I would be smil- 
ing, alert and on the make. 

“Do you want to just say what 
you’re feeling at this second. 
Bob?’’ 

“I would in a minute, Sigfrid, if 
I knew what it was.’’ 

“Don’t you know, really? Can’t 
you remember what was in your 
head while you weren’t talking, just 
now?’’ 

“Sure I can!’’ I hesitate, then I 
say, “Oh, hell, Sigfrid, I guess I 
was just waiting to be coaxed. I had 
an insight the other day, and it hurt. 
Oh, wow, you wouldn’t believe 
how it hurt. I was crying like a 
baby.’’ 

“What was the insight, Bobby?’’ 
“I’m trying to tell you. It was 
about — Well, it was partly about 
my mother. But it was also about, 
well, you know, Dane Metchnikov. 
I iTad — these — I had — ’’ 

“I think you’re trying to say 
something about the fantasies you 
had of having anal sex with Dane 
Metchnikov, Bob. Is that right?’’ 
“Yeah. You remember good, 
Sigfrid. When I was crying, it was 
about my mother. Partly. ...” 
“You told me that. Bob.’’ 
“Right.” And I close up. Sigfrid 
waits. I wait, too. I suppose I want 
to be coaxed some more, and after

Dearest Father, Mother, Marisa and

Please tell Susie's father that she 
is very well and is regarded with

for yourselves whether to tell him 
that she has been seeing much of my 
friend Rob Broadhead. He is a good 
man and a .serious one, but he is not 
a fortunate one. Susie has applied 
for leave to go on a mission, and if 
the captain grants it she speaks of 
going with Broadhead. IVe all speak 
of going, but as you know, we do 
not all do it, so perhaps it is not to 
be wmried about. 

This must he very short; it is

a while Sigfrid obliges me: 

“Let’s see if I can help you, 
Bob,” he says. “What do crying 
about your mother, and your fan- 
tasies about anal sex with Dane, 
have to do with each other?” 

I feel something happening inside 
of me. It feels as though the soft, 
wet inside of my chest is starting to 
bubble into my throat. I can tell that 
when my voice comes out it is 
going to be tremulous and desper- 
ately forlorn if I don’t control it. So 
I try to control it, although I know 
perfectly well that I have no secrets 
of this sort from Sigfrid; he can 
read his sensors and know what is 
going on inside me from the trem- 
ble of a triceps or the dampness of 
a palm. 

But I make the effort anyway. In 
the tones of a biology instructor ex- 

GATEWAY 



plaining a prepared frog I say: 
“See, Sigfrid, my mother loved 
me. I knew it. You know it. It was 
a logical demonstration; she had no 
choice. And Freud said once that no 
boy who is certain he was his 
mother’s favorite ever grows up to 
be neurotic. Only — ” 

“Please,* Robby, that isn’t quite 
right, and besides you’re intellec- 
tualizing. You know yod really 
don’t want to put in all these 
preambles. You’re stalling, aren’t 
you?” 

Other times 1 would tear the cir- 
cuits out of his chips for that, but 
this time he has my mood gauged 
correctly. “All right. But I did 
know that my mother loved me. 
She couldn’t help it! I was her only 
son. My father was dead — don’t 
clear your throat, Sigfrid, I’m get- 
ting to it. It was a logical necessity 
that she loved me, and I understood 
it that way with no doubt at all in 
my mind, but she never said so. 
Never once.” 

“You mean that never, in your 
whole life, did she say to you, ‘I 
love you, son?’ ” 

“No!” I scream. Then I get con- 
trol again. “Or not directly, no. I 
mean, once when I was like eigh- 
teen years old and going to sleep in 
the next room, I heard her say to 
one of her friends — girl friends, I 
mean — that she really thought I was 
a tremendous kid. She was proud of 
me. I don’t remember what I’d 
done, something, won a prize or got 
a job, but she right that minute was 
proud of me and loved me, and said 
so. But not to me.” 

“Please go on. Bob,” Sigfrid 
says after a moment. 

“I am going on! Give me a min- 

85 




ute. It hurts; I guess it’s what you 
call priin^ pain.” 

“Please don’t diagnose yourself, 
Bob. Just say it. Let it come out.” 

“Oh, shii.” 

I reach for a cigarette and then 
stop the motion. That’s usually a 
good thing to do when things get 
tight with Sigfrid, because it will 
almost always distract him into an 
argument about whether I am trying 
to relieve tension instead of dealing 
with it; but this time I am too dis- 
gusted with myself, with Sigfrid, 
even with my mother. 1 want to get 
it over with. I say: “Look, Sigfrid, 
here’s how it was. I loved my 
mother a lot, and I know — 
knew! — she loved me. But she 
wasn’t very good at showing it.” 

1 suddenly realize I have a 
cigarette in my hands, and I’m roll- 
ing it around without lighting it 
and, wondrous to say, Sigfnd hasn’t 
even commented on it. I plunge 
right on: “She didn’t say the words 
to me. Not only that. It’s funny, 
Sigfrid, but you know, I can’t re- 
member her ever touching me. I 
mean, not really. She would kiss 
me goodnight, sometimes. On the 
top of the head. And I remember 
she told me stories. And she was 
always there when I needed her. 
But—” 

I have to stop for a moment, to 
get control of my voice again. I in- 
hale deeply and evenly through my 
nose, concentrating on breath flow. 

“But you see, Sigfrid,” 1 say, 
rehearsing the words ahead of time 
and pleased with the clarity and 
balance with which 1 deliver them, 
“she didn’t touch me much. Except 
for one way. She was very good to 
me when 1 was sick. 1 was sick a 



lot. Everybody around the food 
mines has Tunny noses, skin 
infections — you know. She got me 
everything I needed. She was there, 
God knows how, holding down a 
job and taking care of me, all at 
once. And when I was sick, she — ” 
After a moment Sigfrid says, 
“Go on, Robby. Say it.” 

1 try, but I am still stuck, and he 
says: 

“Just say it the fastest way you 
can. Get it out. Don’t worry if 1 
understand, or if it makes sense. 
Just get rid of the words.” 

“Well, she would take my tem- 
perature,,” I explain. “You know? 
Stick a thermometer into me. And 
she’d bold me for, you know, 
whatever it is, three minutes or so. 
And then she’d take the thermome- 
ter out and read it.” 

I am right on the verge of bawl- 
ing. I’m willing to let it happen, but 
first 1 want to follow this thing 
through; it is almost a sexual thing, 
like when you are getting right up 
to the moment of decision with 
some person and you don’t think 
you really want to let her be that 
mjich a part of you but you go 
ahead anyhow. 1 save up voice con- 
trol, measuring it out so that I 
won’t run out before I finish. Sig- 
frid doesn’t say anything, and after 
a moment I manage the words: 

“You see how it is, Sigfrid? It’s 
funny. All my life now — what is it, 
maybe forty years since then? And 1 
still have this crazy notion that 
being loved has something to do 
with having things stuck up my 
ass.”

There had been a lot of changes 
on Gateway while I was out. The 
head tax had been raised. The Cor- 
poration wanted to get rid of some 
of the extra hangers-on, like Shicky 
and me; bad news; it meant that my 
prepaid per capita wasn’t good for 
two or three weeks, it was only 
good for ten days. They had impor- 
ted a bunch of double-domes from 
Earth, astronomers, xenotechs, 
mathematicians, even old Professor 
Hegramet was up from Earth, 
bruised from the lift-off deltas but 
hopping spryly around the tunnels. 

One thing that hadn’t changed 
was the Evaluation Board, and I 
was impaled on the hot seat in front 
of it, squirming while my old friend 
Emma told me in great detail what 
a fool I was. 

Mr. Hsien was actually doing the 
telling, Emma only translated. But 
she loved her work. 

“I warned you you’d fuck up, 

Broadhead. You should have lis- 
tened to me. Why did you change 
the setting?” 

“1 told you. When I found out I 
was at Gateway Two I just couldn’t 
handle it. I wanted to go some- 
where else.” 

“Extraordinarily stupid of you, 

Broadhead.” 

I glanced at Hsien. He had hung 
himself up on the wall by his 
rolled-up collar and was hanging 
there, beaming benignly, hands 
folded. “Emma,” I said, “do 
whatever you want to do, but get 
off my back.” 

She said sunnily, “I am doing 
what I want to do, Broadhead, be- 
cause it’s what I have to do. It’s my 
job. You knew it was against the 
rules to change the settings.”

■ Extract from log. “At 84 days 6 
hours out the Q instrument began to 
glow and there was unusual activity in 
the control lights. At the same time I 
felt a change in the direction of thrust. 
For about one hour there was continuing 
changes, then the Q light went out and 
things went back to normal.”

some transient hazard, perhaps a star or 
other body? Recommend computer

“What rules? It was my ass that 
was on the line.” 

“The rules that say you shouldn’t 
destroy a ship,” she explained. I 
didn’t answer, and she chirped 
some sort of translation to Hsien, 
who listened gravely, pursed his 
lips and then delivered two neat 
paragraphs in Mandarin. You could 
hear the punctuation. 

“Mr. Hsien says,” said Emma, 
“that you are a very irresponsible 
person. You have killed an irre- 
placeable piece of equipment. It 
was not your property. It belonged 
to the whole human race.” He lilted 
a few more sentences, and she 
finished: “We cannot make a final 
determination of your liability until 
we have further information about 
the condition of the ship you dam- 
aged. According to Mr. Ituno he 
will have a complete check made of 
the ship at the first opportunity. 
There were two xenotechs in transit 
for the new planet. Aphrodite, at 
the time of his report. They will 

88 



have reached Gateway Two by 
now, and we can expect their find- 
ings, probably, with the next out- 
pilot. Then we will call you again.” 

She paused, looking at me, and I 
took it the interview was over. 
“Thanks a lot,” I said, and pushed 
myself toward the door. She let me 
get all the way to it before she said: 

“One more thing. Mr. Ituno’ s 
report mentions that you worked on 
loading and fabricating suits on 
Gateway Two. He authorizes a per 
diem payment to you amounting to, 
let me see, twenty-five hundred dol- 
lars. And your out-captain, Hester 
Bergowiz, has authorized payment 
of one per cent of her bonus to you 
for services during the return flight; 
so your account has been credited 
accordingly.” 

“I didn’t have a contract with 
her,” I said, surprised. 

“No. But she feels you should 
have a share. A small share, to be 
sure. Altogether — ” she looked 
under a paper — ’’ it comes to 
twenty-five hundred plus fifty-five 
hundred, eight thousand dollars 
your account has been credited 
with.” 

Eight thousand dollars! I headed 
for a drop-shaft, grabbed an up- 
cable and pondered. It was not 
enough to make any real difference. 
It certainly would not be enough to 
pay the damages they would soak 
me for messing up a ship. There 
wasn’t enough money in the uni- 
verse to pay that, if they wanted to 
charge me full replacement cost; 
there was no way to replace it. 

On the other hand, it was eight 
thousand dollars more than I’d had. 

I celebrated by buying myself a 
drink at the Blue Hell. While I was 



GALAXY 




A NOTE ON BLACK HOLES 

Dr. Asmenion. Now, if you start 
with a star bigger than three solar 
masses and it collapses, it doesn't 
just turn into a neutron star. It 
keeps on going. It gets so dense 
that the escape velocity exceeds 
thirty million centimeters a sec- 
ond . which is. ? 

Question. Uh. The speed of 
light? 

Dr. Asmenion. Right on, Gal- 
lina. So light can't escape. So it's 
black. So that's why it's called a 
black hole — only, if you get close 
enough, inside what's called the 
ergosphere, it isn't black. You 
probably could see something. 

Question. What would it look 
like? 

Dr. Asemnion. Beats the ass off 
me, Jer. If anybody ever goes and 
sees one, he'll come back and tell 
us if he can. Only he probably 
can't. You could maybe get that 
close in, get your readings and 
come back — and collect, jesus, I 
don't kTiow, a million dollars 
anyway. If you could get into 
your lander, see, and kick the 
main mass of the ship away, 
backward, slowing it down, you 
might be able to give yourself 
enough extra velocity to get away. 
Not easily. But maybe, if things 
were just right. But then where 
would you go? You can't get 
home in a lander. And doing it 
the other way wouldn't work, 
there isn't enough mass in a 
lander to get you free. ... I see 
old Bob isn't enjoying this discus- 
sion, so let's move on to planetary 
types and dust clouds.

drinking it, I thought about my op- 
tions. The more I thought about 
them, the more they dwindled 
away. 

They would find me culpable, no 
doubt about that, and the least 
they’d assess me would be some- 
where in the hundreds of thousands 
of dollars. Well, I didn’t have it. It 
might be a lot more, but that didn’t 
make any difference; once they take 
away all you have there isn’t any- 
thing left anyway. 

So when you came right down to 
it, my eight thousand dollars was 
fairy gold. It could vanish with the 
morning dew. As soon as the 
xenotech’s report came in from 
Gateway Two the Board would re- 
convene and that would be the end 
of that. 

So there was no particular reason 
to stretch my money. I might as 
well spend it. 

There was no reason, either, to 
think about getting back my old job 
as an ivy-planter . even assum- 
ing I could get it, with Shicky fired 
from his job as straw-boss. The 
minute they made a judgment 
against me my credit balance would 
disappear. So would my prepaid 
per-capita payment. I would be sub- 
ject to immediate defenestration. 

If there happened to be an 
Earth-bound ship in port at the time 
, I could just get on board, and 
sooner or later I would be back in 
Montana looking for my old job at 
the food mines. If there wasn’t a 
ship, then I was in trouble. I might 
be able to talk the American 
cruiser, or maybe the Brazilian one 
if Francy Hereira was in a position 
to pull strings for me, into taking 
me abbard for a while until a ship 

90 



showed up. Or I might not. 

Considered carefully, the chances 
were not very hopeful. 

The very best thing I could do 
would be to act before the Board 
did, and there there were two 
choices. 

I could take the next ship in port 
back to Earth and the food mines, 
without waiting for the Board’s de- 
cision. 

Or I could ship out again. 

They were two lovely choices. 
One of them meant giving up every 
chance of a decent life forever 
. and the other one scared me 
out of my mind. 

* 

Gateway was like a gentlemen’s 
club in which you never knew what 
members were in town. Louise 
Forehand was gone; her husband, 
Sess, was patiently holding the fort, 
waiting for her or their remaining 
daughter to return before shipping 
out again himself. He helped me 
move back into my room, which 
had been temporarily occupied by 
three Hungarian women until they 
had shipped out together in a Three. 
Moving took no great effort; I 
didn’t own anything any more, ex- 
cept what I had just bought in the 
commissary. 

The only permanent feature was 
Shicky Bakin, unfailingly friendly 
and always there. I asked him if he 
had heard from Klara. He had not. 
“Go out again. Bob,’’ he urged. 
“It is the only thing to do.’’ 

“Yeah.” I did not want to argue 
it, he was incontestably right. 
Maybe I would .... I said, “I 
wish I weren’t a coward, Shicky, 

GALAXY 




but I am. I just don’t know how I 
can make myself get into a ship 
again. I don’t have the courage to 
face a hundred days of fearing death 
every minute.” 

He chuckled, and hopped off the 
chest of drawers to pat my shoul- 
der. ‘‘You don’t need so much 
courage,” he said, flapping back to 
the chest. ‘‘You only need courage 
for one day; Just to get in the ship 
and go. Then you don’t have to 
have courage any more, because 
you don’t anymore have a choice.” 

‘‘I think I could have done it,” I 
said, ‘‘if Metchnikov’s theories 
about the color-codes had been 
light. But some of the safe ones are 
dead.” 

‘‘It was only a statistical matter. 
Bob. It is tme that there is a better 
safety record now, and a better suc- 
cess record too. Only marginal, yes. 
But better.” 

‘‘The ones that died are just as 
dead,” I said. ‘‘Still — perhaps I’ll 
talk to Dane again.” 

Shicky looked surprised. ‘‘He’s 
out.” 

‘‘When?” 

‘‘Around when you left. I 
thought you knew.” 

I had forgotten. ‘‘Wonder if he 
found the soft touch he was looking 
for.” 

Shicky scratched his chin with his 
shoulder, keeping himself balanced 
with lazy wing strokes. Then he 
hopped off the chest and fluttered 
over the piezophone. ‘‘Let’s see,” 
he said, and punched buttons. The 
locator board jumped into view on 
the screen. ‘‘Launch 88-173,” he 
read. ‘‘Bonus, $150,000. That’s not 
much, is it?” 

‘‘I thought he was going for 
GATEWAY 



something bigger.” 

“Well,” said Shicky, reading on, 
“he didn’t get it. Says here he 
came back last night.” 

Since Metchnikov had halfway 
promised to share his expertise with 
me, it made sense for me to talk to 
him; but I wasn’t feeling sensible. I 
got as far as checking out that he 
had returned without a find and 
with nothing to show for his efforts 
but the bonus; but I didn’t go to see 
him. 

I didn’t do much of anything, in 
fact. I hung around. 

Gateway is not the most 
amenity-filled place to live in the 
universe, but I found things to do. 
It beat the food mines. Each passing 
hour brought me an hour closer to 
the time when the xenotech’s report 
would arrive, but I managed not to 
think about that rnost of £e time. I 
nursed drinks in the Blue Hell, 
making friends with the tourists, the 
visiting cruiser crews, the returnees, 
the new fish that kept coming up 
from the sweltering planets, look- 
ing, I guess, for another Klara. 
None showed up. 

I read over the letters I had writ- 
ten her on the trip back from Gate- 
way Two, and then I tore them up. 
Instead I wrote a simple short note 
to apologize and tell her that I loved 
her and took it down to radio it off 
to her on Venus. But she wasn’t 
there! I had forgotten how long the 
slow Hohmann orbits took. The 
locator office identified the ship she 
had left on easily enough; it was a 
right-angle orbiter, that spent its 
whole life changing deltas to ren- 
dezvous with plane-of-the-ecliptic 
flights between the planets. Accord- 
ing to the records her ship had

made a rendezvous with a Mars- 
bound freighter, and then a Venus- 
bound high-G luxury liner; she had 
presumably transferred to one of 
them, but they didn’t know which, 
and neither one of them would 
reach its destination for a month or 
more yet. 

1 sent duplicate copies to each 
ship, but there wasn’t any answer. 

The closest I came to a new girl 
friend was a Gunner Third from the 
Brazilian cruiser. Francy Hereira 
brought her around. “My cousin,’’ 
he said, introducing us; and then, 
privately, later, “You should know, 
Rob, that I do not have family feel- 
ings about my cousins.’’ All the 
crews got shore leave on Gateway 
from time to time, and while, as I 
have said. Gateway wasn’t Waikiki 
or Cannes, it beat the bare bones of

lian navy at all, but she didn’t look 
it. She did not speak much English, 
but we did not need much language 
in common to drink at the Blue 
Hell; and when we went to bed we 
discovered that although we had 
very little conversation in a verbal 
sense we communicated beautifully 
with our bodies. 

But Susie was only there one day 
a week, and that left a great deal of 
time which needed destroying. 

I tried everything: a reinforce- 
ment group, group-hugging and 
working out loves and hostilities on 
each other. Old Hegramet’s lecture 
series on the Heechee. A program 
of talks on astrophysics, with a 
slant toward earning science 
bonuses from the Corporation. By 
careful budgeting of my time I 
managed to use it all up, and deci- 
sion was postponed day by day. 

I do not want to give the impres- 
sion that destroying time was a con- 
scious plan in my mind; I was liv- 
ing from day to day, and each day 
was full. On a Thursday Susie and 
Francy Hereira would check in, and 
the three of us might have lunch at 
the Blue Hell. Then Francy would 
go off to roam by himself, or pick 
up a girl, or take a swim in Lake 
Superior, while Susie and I would 
retire to my room and my dope 
sticks to swim on those warmer wa- 
ters of my bed. After dinner, some 
sort of entertainment. Thursday was 
the night the astrophysics lectures 
took place, and we would hear 
about the Hertzspmng-Russell dia- 
gram, or red giants and dwarfs, or 
neutron stars, or black holes. The 
professor was a fat old girl-grabber 
from some jerkwater college near 
Smolinsk, but even through the 

GALAXY 




dirty jokes there was poetry and 
beauty in what he talked about. He 
dwelt on the old stars that gave 
birth to us all, spitting silicates and 
magnesium carbonate into space to 
form our planets, hydrocrabons to 
form ourselves. He talked about the 
neutron stars that bent the gravity 
well around them; we knew about 
them, because two launches had 
killed themselves, sheared into rub- 
ble, by entering normal space too 
close to one of those hyper-dense 
dwarfs. He told us about the black 
holes that were the places where a 
dense star had been, now detectable 
only by the observable fact that they 
swallowed everything nearby, even 
light; they had not merely bent the 
gravity well, they had wrapped it 
around themselves like a blanket. 
He described stars as thin as air, 
immense clouds of glowing gas; 
told us about the pre-stars of the 
Orion Nebula, Just now blossoming 
into loose knots of warm gas that 
might in a million years be suns. 
His lectures were very popular; 
even old hands like Shicky and 
Dane Metchnikov showed up. 
While I listened to the professor I 
could feel the wonder and beauty of 
space. It was too immense and 
glorious to be frightening, and it 
was not until later that I would re- 
late those sinks of radiation and 
swamps of thin gas to me, to the 
frail, frightened, pain-sensitive crea- 
tion that was the body I inhabited. 
And then I would think about going 
out among those remote titans 
and . my soul curled up inside 
me. 

After one of those meetings I said 
good-by to Susie and Francy and sat 
in an ^cove near the lecture room. 



half hidden by the ivy, and despon- 
dently smoked a joint. Shicky found 
me there, and halted just in front of 
me, supporting himself on his 
wings. “I was looking for you. 
Bob,” he said, and stopped. 

The grass was just beginning to 
hit me. “Interesting lecture,” I said 
absently, reaching for the good feel- 
ing that I wanted from the joint and 
not really very interested in whether 
Shicky was there or not. 

“You missed the most interesting 
part,” said Shicky. 

It occurred to me that he was 
looking both fearful and hopeful; 
there was something on his mind. I 
took another hit, and offered him 
the joint; he shook his head. 
“Bob,” he said, “I think there is 
something worth having coming 
up.” 

“Really?” 

“Yes, really. Bob! Something 
quite good. And soon.” 

I was not ready for this, I wanted 
to go on smoking my joint until the 
temporary thrill of the lecture had 
worn off, so that I could go back to 
destroying the days. The last thing I 
wanted was to hear about some new 
mission that my guilt would make 
me want to sign on for, and my fear 
would abort. 

Shicky caught the shelf of ivy 
and held himself up by it, looking 
at me curiously. “Bob-friend,” he 
said, “if I can find something out 
for you, will you help me?” 

“Help you how?” 

“Take me with you!” he cried. 
“I can do everthing but go in the 
lander. And this mission, I think, is 
one where it does not so much mat- 
ter. There is a bonus for everyone, 
even for someone who must remain

Mission Report 

Vessel A3-77, Voyage 036D51. 
Crew T. Parreno, N. Ahoya, E. Nim- 
kin. 

Transit time 5 days 14 hours. Posi- 
tion vicinity Alpha Centauri A. 

Summary. “The planet was quite 
earthlike and. heavily vegetated. The 
color of the vegetation was predomin- 
antly yellow. The atmosphere matched 
the Heechee mix closely. It is a warm 
planet with no polar ice caps and a 
temperature range similar to Earth 
tropics at the equator. Earth temperate 
extending almost to the poles. We de- 
tected no animal life or signatures 
(methane, etc.) thereof. Some of the 
vegetation predates at a very slow pace, 
advancing by uprooting portions of a 
vinelike structure, curling around and 
rerooting. Maximum velocity measured 
was approximately 2 kilometer per 
hour. 

No artifacts. Parrena and Nimkin 
landed and returned with samples of 
vegetation, but died of a toxico- 
dendron-like reaction. Great blisters 
formed over their bodies. Then they 
developed pain, itching and apparent 
suffocation, probably due to fluids ac- 
cumulating in the lungs. I did not bring 
them aboard the vessel. I did not open 
the lander, or dock it to the vessel. 1 re- 
corded personal messages for both, then 
jettisoned the lander and returned with- 
out it."

made against N. Ahoya in view of past

in orbit.” 

“What are you talking about, 
Shicky?” 

The grass was hitting me now; I 



could feel the warmth behind my 
knees and the gentle blur all 
around me. 

“Metchnikov was talking to the 
lecturer,” Shicky said. “I think 
from what he said that he knows of 
a new mission. Only — they spoke in 
Russian, and I did not understand 
very well. But it is the one he has 
been waiting for.” 

I said reasonably, “The last one 
he went out on wasn’t much, was 
it?” 

“This is different!” 

“I don’t think he would really 
cut me in on anything good — ” 
“Certainly not, if you don’t 
ask.” 

“Oh, hell,” I grumbled. “All 
right. I’ll talk to him.” 

Shicky beamed. “And then. Bob, 
please — take me with you?” 

I stubbed out the Joint, less than 
half smoked; I felt as though I 
wanted what was left of my wits 
about me. “I’ll do what I can,” I 
said, and headed back for the lec- 
ture room just as Metchnikov was 
coming out. 

We had not spoken since he had 
returned. He looked as solid and 
broad as ever, and his fringe of 
chin-whiskers was neatly trimmed. 
“Hello, Broadhead,” he said suspi- 
ciously. 

I didn’t waste words. “I hear 
you’ve got something good coming 
up. Can I go along?” 

He didn’t waste words, either. 
“No.” 

He looked at me with frank 
dislike. Partly that was what I had 
expected from him all along, but I 
was pretty sure part of it was be- 
cause he had heard about me and 
Klara.

“You are going out,’’ I persisted. 
“What is it, a One?’’ 

He stroked his whiskers. “No,” 
he said reluctantly, “it isn’t a One. 
It’s two Fives.” 

“Two Fives?” 

He stared at me suspiciously for a 
moment, and then almost grinned; I 
did not like him when he smiled, it 
was always a question in my mind 
what he was smiling about. 

“All right,” he said. “You want 
in, you can have it, for all of me. 
It's not up to me, of course. You’ll 
have to ask Emma; she’s doing a 
briefing tomorrow morning. But she 
might let you go. It’s a science mis- 
sion, with a minimum million-dollar 
bonus. And you’re involved.” 

“I’m involved?” That was some- 
thing out of an unexpected direc- 
tion! “Involved how?” 

“Ask Emma,” he said, and 
brushed past me. 

* * 

There were about a dozen pros- 
pectors in the briefing room, most 
of whom I knew: Sess Forehand, 
Shicky, Metchnikov and a few 
others I’d drunk with or gone to bed 
with, one time or another. Emma 
wasn’t there yet, and I managed to 
intercept her as she was coming in. 

“I want to go out on this mis- 
sion,” I said. 

She looked startled. “You do? I 
thought — ” But she stopped there, 
without saying what it was she 
thought. I followed up: 

“I have as much right to go as 
Metchnikov does!” 

“You sure as hell don’t have as 
good a record as he does. Bob.” 
She looked me over carefully, and

then she said, “Well, I’ll tell you 
how it is, Broadhead. It’s a special 
mission, and partly you’re responsi- 
ble for it. That boner of yours turns 
out to be interesting. I don’t mean 
wrecking the ship; that was stupid, 
and if there was any justice in the 
universe you’d pay for it. But dumb 
luck is almost as good as brains.” 

“You got the report from Gate- 
way Two,” I guess^. 

She shook her head. “Not yet. 
But it doesn’t matter. We routinely 
programmed your mission into the 
computer, and it found some in- 
teresting correlations. The course 
pattern that took you to Gateway 
Two — Oh, hell,” she said, “come 
on inside. You can sit through the 
briefing, at least. It’ll explain every- 
thing, and then — we’ll see.” 

She took my elbow and pushed 
me ahead of her into the room, 
which was the same one we had 
used for a classroom — how long be- 
fore? It seemed like a million years. 
I sat down between Sess and 
Shicky, and waited to hear what it 
was she had to say. 

“Most of you,” she started off, 
“are here by invitation — with one 
or two exceptions. One of the ex- 
ceptions is our distinguished friend 
Mr. Broadhead. He managed to 
wreck a ship near Gateway Two, as 
most of you know. By rights we 
ought to throw the book at him, but 
before he did that he accidentally 
turned up some interesting facts. 
His course colors were not the regu- 
lar ones for Gateway Two, and 
when the computer compared them 
it came up with a whole new con- 
cept of course setting. Apparently 
only about five settings are critic^ 
for destination — the five that were 

95 




the same for the usual Gateway 
Two setting, and for Broadhead’s 
new one. What the other settings 
mean we don’t know. But we’re 
going to find out.” 

She leaned back and folded her 
hands. “This is a multiple-purpose 
mission,” she said. “We’re going 
to do something new. For openers, 
we’re going to send two ships to the 
same destination.” 

Sess Forehand raised his hand. 
“What’s the point of that?” 

“Well, partly to make sure it is 
the same destination. We’re going 
to vary the non-critical settings 
slightly . the ones we think are 
non-critical. And we’re going to 
start the two ships only a few seconds 
apart. 

“Now, if we know what we’re 
doing, that means you’ll come out 
about as far apart as Gateway 
travels in thirty seconds.” 

Forehand wrinkled his brow. 
“Relative to what?” 

“Good question,” she nodded. 
Relative, we think, to the Sun. The 
stellar motion relative to the 
Galaxy — we think — can be ne- 
glected. At least, assuming that 
your destination turns out to be in- 
side the Galaxy, and not so far 
away that the galactic motion has a 
markedly different vector. I mean, 
if you came out on the opposite 
side, it would be seventy kilometers 
a second, relative to the galactic 
center. We don’t think that’s in- 
volved. We only expect a relatively 
minor difference in velocity and di- 
rection, and — well, anyway, you 
should come out within somewhere 
between two and two hundred 
kilometers of each other. 

“Of course,” she said, smiling 



A NOTE ON SIGNATURES 

Dr. Asmenion. So when you're 
looking for signs of life on a 
planet, you don't expect a big 
neon sign that says "Aliens Live 
Here". You look for signatures. A 
“signature" is something that 
shows something else is there. 
Like your signature on a check. If 
I see that, I know it shows that 
you want it paid, so I cash it. Not 
yours, of course. Bob. 

Question. God hates a smart- 
assed teacher. 

Dr. Asmenion. No offense. Bob. 
Methane is a typical signature. It 
shows the presence of warm- 
blooded mammals, or something 
like them. 

Question. I thought methane 
could come from rotting vegeta- 
tion and all that? 

Dr. Asmenion. Oh, sure. But 
mostly it comes from the guts of 
large ruminants. Most of the 
methane in the Earth's air is cow 
farts. 



cheerfully, “that’s only theoretical. 
Maybe the relative motions won’t 
mean anything at all. In that case, 
the problem is to keep you from 
colliding with each other. But we’re 
sure — pretty sure — that there will be 
at least some, displacement. All you 
really need is about fifteen 
meters — the long diameter of a 
Five.” 

“How sure is pretty sure?” one 
of the girls asked. 

“Well,” Emma admitted, “rea- 
sonably sure. How do we know 
until we try?” 

“It sounds dangerous,” Sess 
commented. He did not seem deter-

red by it. He was only stating an 
opinion. In this he was unlike me; I 
was very busy ignoring my inner 
sensations, trying to concentrate on 
the technicalities of the briefing. 

Emma looked surprised. “That 
part? Look, I haven’t come to the 
dangerous part yet. This is a non- 
accept destination for all Ones, 
most Threes and some Fives.” 

“Why?” someone asked. 

“That’s what you’re going there 
to find out,” she said patiently. “It 
happens to be the setting the com- 
puter picked out as best for testing 
the correlations between course set- 
tings. You’ve got armored Fives, 
and both accept this particular des- 
tination. That means you have 
what the Heechee designers figured 
was a good chance to handle it, 
right?” 

“That was a long time ago,” I 
objected. 

“Oh, sure. I never said other- 
wise. It is dangerous — at least to 
some extent. That’s what the mil- 
lion is for.” 

She stopped, gravely considering 
us, until someone obliged by ask- 
ing, “What million?” 

“The million-dollar bonus each 
one of you gets when you come 
back,” she said. “They’ve appro- 
priated ten million dollars out of 
Corporation funds for this. Equal 
shares. Of course, there’s a good 
chance that it will be more than a 
million each. If you find anything 
worth while, the regular pay scales 
apply. And the computer thinks this 
is a good prospect.” 

“Why is it worth ten million?” I 
asked. 

“I don’t make these decisions,” 
she said patiently. And then she 



looked at me as a person, not part 
of the group, and added, “And by 
the way, Broadhead. We’re writing 
off your damage to the ship. So 
what ever you get is yours to keep. 
A million dollars? That’s a nice lit- 
tle nest-egg. You can go back 
home, buy yourself a little business, 
live the rest of your life on that.” 

We looked at each other, and 
Emma just sat there, smiling gently 
and waiting. I don’t know what the 
others were thinking about. What I 
was remembering was Gateway 
Two and the first trip, wearing our 
eyes out at the instruments, looking 
for something that wasn’t there. I 
suppose each of the others had 
washouts of their own to remember. 

“Launch,” she said at last, “is 
day after tomorrow. The ones who 
want to sign, come see me in my 
office.” 

They accepted me. They turned 
Shicky down. 

But it wasn’t as easy as that, 
nothing ever is; the one who made 
sure Shicky was not going to go 
along was me. They filled up the 
first ship quickly: Sess Forehand, 
two girls from Sierra Leone and a 
French couple — all English- 
speaking, all briefed, all with previ- 
ous missions. For the second ship 
Metchnikov signed as crew chief 
right away; a gay couple Danny A. 
and Danny R., were his first picks. 
Then, grudgingly, he agreed to me. 
And that left one opening. 

“We can take your friend Ba- 
kin,” Emma said. “Or would you 
prefer your other friend?” 

“What other friend?” I de- 
manded. 

“We have an application,” she 
said, “from Gunner Third Suzanna

Dear Voice of Gateway : 

Last month I spent

Liverpool the dubious 
honour of a visit ( for 
which he was well paid,

flaming well said that 
drove me right up the

had just no idea of how 
dicey things were for you 
noble adventurers. 

Well, mate, this morning

the wife could get a lung

She has their permission to take 
leave for this purpose.” 

“Susie! I didn’t know she’d vol-

Emma studied her punch card re- 
flectively. “She’s very well qual- 
ified,” she commented. “Also she 
has all her parts. I am referring,” 
she said sweetly, “to her legs, of 
course, although as I understand it 
you have some interest in her other 
parts as well. Or would you care to 
go gay for this mission?” 

I felt an unreasoning rush of 
anger. I am not one of your sexu-

from. And after spending 
eight-to-twelve this 
morning waiting by the

“Why the hell are you asking

“I don’t give a damn!” I yelled, 
and left.

But there is no such thing as 
avoiding a decision. Not making a 
decision was in itself decision 
enough to keep Shicky off the crew. 
If I had fought for him, they would 
have taken him; without that, Susie 
was the obvious choice. 

I spent the next day staying out 
of Shicky’s way. I picked up a new 
fish at the Blue Hell, fresh but of 
the classroom, and spent the night 
in her room. 1 didn’t even go back 
to my own room for fresh clothes; I 
dumped everything and bought a 
new outfit. I knew pretty well the” 
places where Shicky might look for 
me — the Blue Hell, Central Park, 
the museum — and so I stayed away 
from all those places; I went for a 
long, rambling wander through the 
deserted tunnels, seeing no one at 
all, until late that night. 

Then I took a chance and went to 
our farewell party. Shicky would 
probably be there, but there would 
be other people around. 

He was. And so was Louise 
Forel^and. In fact, she seemed to be 
the center of attention; I hadn’t even 
known she was back. 

She saw me and waved to me. “I 
struck it rich, Bob! Drink up — I’m 
buying!” 

I let someone put a glass in one 
hand and a joint in the other, and 
before I took my hit I managed to 
ask her what she’d found. 

‘‘Weapons, Bob! Marvelous 
Heechee weapons, hundreds of 
them. Sess says it’s going to be at 
least a five-million-dollar award. 
Plus royalties ... if anyone finds a 
way to duplicate the weapons, any- 
way.” 

I let the smoke blow out and 
washed out the taste with a swallow 



of white lightning. ‘‘What kind of 
weapons?” 

‘‘They’re like the tunnel diggers, 
only portable. They’ll cut a hole 
through anything. We lost Sara al- 
laFanta id the landing; one of them 
put'a hole in her suit. But Tim and 
I are whacking up her share, so it’s 
two and a half mill apiece.” 

‘‘Congratulations,” I said. ‘‘I 
would have thought the last thing 
the human race needed was some 
new ways to kill each other, but — 
congratulations.” I was reaching for 
an air of moral superiority, and 1 
needed it; because as 1 turned away, 
there was Shicky, hanging in air, 
watching me. 

‘‘Want a hit?” I asked, offering 
him the joint. 

He shook his head. 

I said, ‘‘Shicky, it wasn’t up to 
me. I told them — I didn’t tell them 
not to take you.” 

‘‘Did you tell them they 
should?” 

‘‘It wasn’t up to me,” I said. 
‘‘Hey, listen!” I went on, suddenly 
seeing an out. ‘‘Now that Louise 
has hit, Sess probably won’t want 
to go. Why don’t you take his 
place?” 

He backed away, watching me; 
only his expression had changed. 
‘‘You don’t know?” he asked. ‘‘It 
is true that Sess has canceled out 
of the mission, but he has already been 
replaced.” 

‘‘By whom?” 

‘‘By the person right behind 
you,” said Shicky, and I turned 
around, and there she was, looking 
at me, a glass in her hand and an 
expression I could not read on her 
face. 

‘‘Hello, Bob,” said Klara.

1 had prepared myself for the 
party by a number of quick ones in 
the commissary; I was ninety per 
cent dmnk and ten jper cent stoned, 
but it all whooshed out of me as I 
looked at her. I put down the drink, 
handed the joint to someone at ran- 
dom, took her arm and pulled her 
out into the tunnel. 

“Klara,” I said, “Did you get 
my letters?” 

She looked puzzled. “Letters?”

She shook her head. “I guess you 
sent them to Venus? I never got 
there. I got as far as rendezvous 
with the plane-of-the-ecliptic flight, 
and then I changed my mind. I 
came right back on the oririter.” 
“Oh, Klara.” 

“Oh, Bob,” she mimicked, grin- 
ning; that wasn’t much fun, because 
when she smiled 1 could see where 
the tooth was missing that I had 
knocked out. “So what else have 
we got to say to each other?” 

I put my arms around her. “I can 
say that I love you, and I’m sorry, 
and I want to make it up to you, 
and I want to get married and live 
together and have kids and — ” 
“Jesus, Bob,” she said, pushing 
me away, gently enough, “when 
you say something you say a lot, 
don’t you? So hold it for a while. 
It’ll keep.” 

“But it’s been months]” 

She laughed. “No fooling. Bob. 
Tliis is a bad day for Sagittarians to 
make decisions, especially about 
love. We’ll talk about it another 
time.” 

“That crap! Listen, I don’t be- 
lieve in any of that!” 

“I do. Bob.” 

I had an inspiration. “Hey! I bet 
I can trade with somebody in the 
first ship! Or, wait a minute, maybe 
Susie would trade with you — ” 

She shook her head, still smiling. 
“I really don’t think Susie would 
like that,” she said. “Anyway, they

switch with Sess. They’ll never 
stand still for another last-minute 
change.” 

“1 don’t care, Klara!” 

“Bob,” she said, “don’t rush 
me. I did a lot of thinking about

you and me. I think we’ve got 
something that’s worth working for. 
But I can’t say it’s all straight in 
my head yet, and I don’t want to 
push it.” 

“But, Klara — ” 

“Leave it at that. Bob. I’ll go in 
the first ship, you go in the second. 
When we get where we’re going 
we’ll be able to talk. Maybe even 
switch around to come back to- 
gether. But meanwhile we’ll both 
have a chance to think about what 
we really want.” 

The only words I seemed to 
know I seemed to be saying over 
and over again: “But, Klara — ” 

She kissed me, and pushed me 
away. “Bob,” she said, “don’t be 
in such a hurry. We’ve got all the 
time there is.”

“Tell me something, Sigfrid,” I 
say, “how nervous am I?” 

He is wearing his Sigmund Freud 
hologram this time, truculent Vien- 
nese stare, not a bit gemiitlich. But 
his voice is the same gently sad 
baritone: “If you are asking what 
my sensors show. Bob, you are 
quite agitated, yes.” 

“I thought so,” I say, bouncing 
around the mat. 

“Can you tell me why?” 

“No!” The whole week has been 
like that, marvelous sex with Do- 
reen and S. Ya., and floods of tears 
in the shower; fantastic bidding and 
play at the bridge tournament, and 
total despair on the way home. I 
feel like a yo-yo. “I feel like a yo- 
yo,” I yell. “You’ve opened up 
something I can’t handle.” 

“I think you underestimate your 
capacity for handling pain,” he says

reassuringly. 

“Fuck you, Sigfrid! What do you 
know about human capacity?” 

He almost sighs. “Are we back 
to that again. Bob?” 

“We bloody well are!” And fun- 
nily, I feel less nervous; I’ve got 
him into an argument again, and the 
peril is reduced. 

“It is true. Bob, that I am a 
machine. But I am a machine de- 
signed to understand what humans 
are like and, believe me, I am well 
designed for my function.” 

“Designed! Sigfrid,” I say rea- 
sonably, “you aren’t human. You 
may know, but you don’t feel. You 
have no idea what it feels like to 
have to make human decisions and 
carry the load of human emotion. 
You don’t know what it feels like to 
have to tie up a friend to keep him 
from killing. To have someone you 
love die. To know it’s your fault.

To be scared out of your mind.” 

“I do know those things, Bob,” 
he says gently. “I really do. I want 
to explore why you are feeling so 
turbulent, so won’t you please help 
me?” 

“No!” 

“But your agitation. Bob, means 
that we are approaching the central 
pain — ” 

“Get your bloody drill out of my 
nerve!” But the analogy doesn’t 
throw him for a second; his circuits 
are finely tuned that day. 

“I’m not your dentist. Bob, I’m 
your analyst, and I tell you — ” 
“Stop!” I know what I have to 
do to get him away from where it 
hurts. I haven’t used S. Ya.’s secret 
little formula since that first day, 
but now I want to use it again. 1 
say the words, and convert him 
from a tiger to a pussycat; he rolls 
over and lets me stroke his tummy, 
as I command him to display the 
gaudier bits from some of his inter- 
views with attractive and highly 
quirky female patients; and the rest 
of the hour is spent as a peepshow; 
and I have got out of his room one 
more time intact. 

Or nearly.

Out in the holes where the 
Heechee hid, out in the caves of the 
stars, sliding the tunnels they 
slashed and slid, healing the 
Heechee-hacked scars . Jesus, it 
was like a Boy Scout campout; we 
sang and frolicked all the nineteen 
days after turnaround. I don’t think 
I ever felt that good in my life. 
Partly it was release from fear; 

102 



when we hit turnaround we all 
breathed easier, as you always do. 
Partly it was that the first half of 
the trip had been pretty gritty, with 
Metchnikov and his two boy friends 
in a complicated triple spat most of 
the time and Susie Hereira a lot less 
interested in me on shipboard than 
she had been as a once-a-week 
night out on Gateway. But mostly, I 
think, for me anyway, it was know- 
ing that I was getting closer and 
closer to Klara. Danny A. helped 
me work out the figures; he’d 
taught some of the courses on 
Gateway, and he may have been 
wrong but there wasn’t anybody 
around fighter so I took his word 
for it: He calculated from the time 
of turnaround that we were going 
something like three hundred light- 
years in all — a guess, sure, but 
close enough. The first ship, the 
one Klara was in, was getting fur- 
ther and further ahead of us all the 
way to turnaround, at which point 
we were going something over ten 
light-years a day (or so Danny 
said). Klara’s Five had been 
launched thirty seconds ahead of us, 
so then it was just arithmetic: About 
one light-day. 3xl0‘® centimeters 
per second times 60 seconds times 
60 minutes times 24 hours ... at 
turnaround Klara was a good sev- 
enteen and a half billion kilometers 
ahead of us. It seemed very far, and 
was. But after turnaround we were 
getting closer every day, following 
her in the same wormhole through 
space that the Heechee had drilled 
for us. Where my ship was going, 
hers had gone. I could feel that we 
were catching up; sometimes I fan- 
tasied that I could smell her per- 
fume.

When I said something like that 
to Danny A. he looked at me 
queerly. “Do you know how far 
seventeen and a half billion 
kilometers is? You could fit the 
whole solar system in between them 
and us. Just about exactly; the 
semi-major axis of Pluto’s orbit is 
thirty-nine a.u. and change.” 

I laughed, a little embarrassed. 
“It was Just a notion.” 

“So go to sleep,” he said, “and 
have a nice dream about it.” He 
knew how I felt about Klara; the 
whole ship did, even Metchnikov, 
even Susie, and maybe that was a 
fantasy too but I thought they all 
wished us well. We were all wish- 
ing all of us well, constructing 
elaborate plans about what we were 
going to do with our bonuses. For 
Klara and me, at a million dollars 
apiece, it came to a right nice piece 
of change. Maybe not enough for 
Full Medical, no, not if we wanted 
anything left over to have fun on. 
But Major Medical, at least, which 



meant really good health, barring 
something terribly damaging, for 
another thirty or forty years. We 
could live happily ever after on 
what was left over: travel. Children! 
A nice home in a decent part of — 
wait a minute, I cautioned myself, a 
home where? Not back anywhere 
near the food mines. Maybe not on 
Earth at all. Would Klara want to 
go back to Venus? I couldn’t see 
myself taking to the life of a tunnel 
rat. But I couldn’t see Klara in Dal- 
las or New York, either. Of course, 
I thought, wish racing far ahead of 
reality, if we really found anything 
the lousy million apiece might be 
only the beginning. Then we could 
have all the homes we wanted, 
anywhere we liked; and Full Medi- 
cal, too, with transplants to keep us 
young and healthy and beautiful and 
sexually strong and — 

“You really ought to go to 
sleep,” said Danny A. from the 
sling next to mine; “the way you 
thrash around is a caution.” 

But I didn’t feel like going to 
sleep. I was hungry, and there 
wasn’t any reason not to eat. For 
nineteen days we had been practic- 
ing food discipline, which is what 
you do on the way out for the first 
half of the trip. Once you’ve 
reached turnaround you know how 
much you can consume for the rest 
of the trip, which is why, some 
prospectors come back fat. 1 
climbed down out of the lander, 
where Susie and both the Dannys 
were sacked in, and then I found 
out what it was that was making me 
hungry. Dane Metchnikov was

He looked at me thoughtfully. “I

A NOTE ON PIEZOELECTRICITY 

Prof. Hegramet. The one thing 
we found out about blood 
diamonds is that they're fantasti- 
cally piezoelectric. Does anybody 
know what that means? 

Quest/on. They expand and 
contract when an electric current 
is imposed.? 

Prof. Hegrimet. Yes. And the 
other way around. Squeeze them 
and they generate a current. Very 
rapidly if you like. That's the basis 
for the piezophone and piezovi- 
sion. About a fifty billion dollar 
industry. 

Question. Who gets the royal- 
ties on all that loot? 

Prof. Hegramet. You know, I 
thought one of you would ask 
that. Nobody does. Blood 
diamonds were found years and 
years ago, in the Heechee war- 
rens back on Venus. Long before 
Gateway. It was Bell Labs that 
figured out how to use them. Ac- 
tually they use something a little 
different, a synthetic they de- 
veloped. They make great com- 
munications systems, and Bell 
doesn't have to pay anybody but 
themselves. 

Question. Did the Heechee use 
them for that? 

Prof. Hegramet. My personal 
opinion is that they probably did, 
but I don't know how. You'd 
think if they left them around 
they'd leave the rest of the com- 
munications receivers and trans- 
mitters too, but if they did I don't 
know where. 



guess so.” He opened the squeeze- 
fit lid, peered inside, milked 

104 



another hundred cc of water into it 
out of the vapor trap and said, 
“Give it another ten minutes. I was 
going to have a drink first.” 

I accepted the inyitation, and we 
passed a wine-flask back and forth. 
While he shook t^e stew and added 
a dollop of salt I took the star read- 
ings for him. We were still close to 
maximum velocity and there was 
nothing on the viewscreen that 
looked like a familiar constellation, 
or even much like a star; but it was 
all beginning to look friendly and 
good to me. To all of us. I’d never 
seen Dane so cheerful and relaxed. 
“I’ve been thinking,” he said. “A 
million’s enough. After this one I’m 
going back to Syracuse, get my 
doctor’s, get a job. There’s going to 
be some school somewhere that’ll 
want a poet in residence or an En- 
glish teacher who’s been on seven 
missions. They’ll pay me some- 
thing, and the money from this will 
keep me in extras all the rest of my 
life.” 

All I had really heard was the 
one word, and that I had heard loud 
and surprising; “Poet?” 

He grinned. “Didn’t you know? 
That’s how 1 got to Gateway; the 
Guggenheim Foundation paid my 
way.” He took the pot out of the 
.cooker and divided the stew into 
two dishes, and we ate. 

This was the fellow who had 
been shrieking viciously at the two 
Dannys for a solid hour, two days 
before, while Susie and I lay angry 
and isolated in the lander, listening. 
It was all turnaround. We were 
home free; the mission wasn’t going 
to strand us out of fuel, and we 
didn’t have to worry about finding 
anything, because our reward was 



GALAXY 




guaranteed. I asked him about his 
poetry. He wouldn’t recite any, but 
promised to show me copies of 
what he’d sent back to the 
Guggenheims when we reached 
Gateway again. 

And when we’d finished eating, 
and wiped out the pot and dishes 
and put them away, Dane looked at 
his watch. “Too early to wake the 
others up,’’ he said, “and not a 
damn thing to do.” 

He looked at me, smiling. It was 
a real smile, not a grin; and I 
pushed myself over to him, and sat 
in the warm and welcome circle of 
his arm. 

★ * * 

And nineteen days went like an 
hour, and then the clock told us it 
was almost time to arrive. We were 
all awake, crowded into the cap- 
sule, eager as kids at Christmas, 
waiting to open our toys. It had 
been the happiest trip / had ever 
made, and probably one of the hap- 
piest ever. “You know,’’ said 
Danny R. thoughtfully, “I’m almost 
sorry to arrive.” And Susie, just 
beginning to understand our En- 
glish, said: 

“Sim, ja sei,” and then, “I 
too\” She squeezed my hand, and I 
squeezed back; but what I was re- 
ally thinking about was Klara. We 
had tried the radio a couple of 
times, but it didn’t work in the 
Heechee wormholes through space. 
But when we came out I would be 
able to talk to her! I didn’t mind 
that others would be listening, 1 
knew what it was that I wanted to 
say. I even knew what she would 
answer. There was no question 

GATEWAY 



about it; there was surely as much 
euphoria in her ship as in ours, for 
the same reasons, and with all that 
love and Joy the answer was not in 
doubt. 

“We’re stopping!” Danny R. 
yelled. “Can you feel it?” 

“Yes!” crowed Metchnikov, 
bouncing with the tiny surges of the 
pseudo-gravity that marked our re- 
turn to normal space. And there was 
another sign, too: the golden helix 
was beginning to glow, brighter 
every second. 

“I think we’ve made it,” said 
Danny R., bursting with pleasure, 
and I was as pleased as he. 

“I’ll start the spherical scan,” I 
said, confident that 1 knew what to 
do. Susie took her cue from me and 
opened the door up to the lander; 
she and Danny A. were going to go 
out for the star sights. 

But Danny A. didn’t Join her. He 
was staring at the viewscreen. As I 
started the ship turning I could see 
stars, which was normal enough; 
they did not seem special in any 
way, although they were rather 
blurry for some reason. 

I staggered and almost fell. The 
ship’s rotation did not seem as 
smooth as it should be. 

“The radio,” Danny said, and 
Methnifcov, frowning, looked up 
and saw the light. 

“Turn it on,” I cried. The voice 
1 heard might be Klara’s. Metch- 
nikov, still frowning, reached for 
the switch, and then I noticed that 
the helix was a brighter gold than I 
had ever seen it, straw-colored, as 
though it were incandescently hot. 
No heat came from it, but the 
golden color was shot through with 
streaks of pure white. 

105 




“That’s funny,” I said, pointing. 

I don’t know if anyone heard me; 
the radio was pouring out static, 
and inside the capsule the sound 
was very loud. Metchnikov grabbed 
for the tuning and the gain. 

Over the static I heard a voice I 
didn’t recognize at first, but it was 
Danny A’s. “Do you feel that?” he 
yelled. “It’s gravity waves. We’re 
in trouble. Stop the scan!” 

I stopped it reflexively. 

But by then the ship’s screen had 
turned and something was in view 
that was not a star and not a galaxy. 
It was a dimly glowing mass of pale 
blue light, mottled, immense and 
terrifying. Even at the first glimpse 
I knew it was not a sun. No sun can 
be so blue and so dim. It hurt the 
eyes to look at it, not because of its 
brightness. It hurt inside the eyes, 
up far into the optic track; the pain 
was in the brain itself. 

Metchnikov switched off the 
radio, and in the silence that fol- 
lowed 1 heard Danny A. say prayer- 
fully, “Dearest God! We’ve had it. 
That thing is a black hole.”

“With your permission, Bob,” 
says Sigfrid, “I’d like to explore 
something with you before you 
command me into my passive dis- 
play mode.” 

I tighten up, the son of a bitch 
has read my mind. “I observe,” he 
says instantly, “that you are feeling 
some apprehension. That’s what I 
would like to explore.” 

Incredibly, I feel myself trying to 
save his feelings. Sometimes I 
forget he’s a machine. “I didn’t 
know you were aware that I’ve been 
doing that,” I apologize.

“Of course I’m aware. Bob. 
When you have given me the proper 
command I obey it, but you have 
not ever given me the command to 
refrain from recording and integrat-

“You assume good, Sigfrid.” 

“There is no reason that you

“Could you?” 

“I do have the capacity to signal

done that.” 

“Why not?” The old bag of bolts 
keeps on surprising me; all this is 
new to me. 

“As I have said, there is no rea- 
son to. But clearly you are attempt- 
ing to postpone some sort of con- 
frontation, and I would like to tell 
you what I think that confrontation 
involves. Then you can make your 
own decision.” 

“Oh, cripes.” I throw off the 
straps and sit up. “Do you mind if

I smoke?” I know what the answer 
is going to be, but he surprises me 
again. 

‘‘Under the circumstances, no. If 
you feel the need of a tension re- 
ducer I agree. I had even considered 
offering you a mild tranquilizer if 
you wish it.” 

‘‘Jesus,” I said admiringly, light- 
ing up — and I actually have to stop 
myself from offering him one! ‘‘All 
right, let’s have it.” 

Sigfrid gets up, stretches his legs 
and crosses to a more comfortable 
chair! I hadn’t known he could do 
that either. ‘‘I am trying to put you 
at your ease. Bob,” he says, ‘‘as I 
am sure you observe. First let me 
tell you something about my 
^capacities — and yours — which I do 
not think you know. I can provide 
information about any of my 
clients. That is, you are not limited 
to those who have had access to this 
particular terminal.” 

‘‘I don’t think I understand that,” 

I say, after he pauses. 

‘‘I think you do. Or will. When 
you want to. However, the more 
important question is what memory 
you are attempting to keep sup- 
pressed. I feel it is necessary for 
you to unblock it. I had considered 
offering you light hypnosis, or a 
tranquilizer, or even a fully human 
analyst to come in for one session, 
and any or all of those are at your 
disposal if you wish them. But I 
have observed that you are rela- 
tively comfortable in discussions 
about what you perceive as objec- 
tive reality, as distinguished from 
your internalization of reality. So I 
would like to explore a particular 
incident with you in those terms.” 

I carefully tap some ash off the 

GATEWAY 



end of my cigarette. He’s right 
about that; as long as we keep the 
conversation abstract and imper- 
sonal I can talk about any bloody- 
thing. ‘‘What incident is that, Sig- 
frid?” 

‘‘Your final prospecting voyage 
from Gateway, Bob. Let me refresh 
your memory — ” 

“Jesus, Sigfrid!" 

‘‘I know you think you recall it 
perfectly,” he says, interpreting me 
exactly, ‘‘and in that sense 1 don’t 
suppose your memory needs refresh- 
ing. But what is interesting about 
that particular episode is that all the 
main areas of your internal concern 
seem to converge there. Your ter- 
ror. Your homosexual tendencies” 
“Hey! ” 

‘‘ — which are not, to be sure, a 
major part of your sexuality. Bob, 
but which give you more concern 
than is warranted. YOur feelings 
about your mother. The immense 
burden of guilt you lay on yourself. 
And, above all, the woman Gelle- 
Klara Moynlin. All these things 
recur over and over in your dreams. 
Bob, although you often do not 
make the identification. And they 
are all present in this one episode.” 

I stub out a cigarette, and realize 
that I have had two going at once. 
‘‘I don’t see the part about my 
mother,” I say at last. 

‘‘You don’t?” The hologram that 
I call Sigfrid von Shrink turns to- 
ward a comer of the room. “Let me 
show you a picture.” He raises his 
hand — that’s pure theater, I know it 
is — and in the comer there appears 
a woman’s figure. It is not very 
clear, but it is young, slim and is in 
the act of covering a cough. 

‘‘It’s not a very good resem- 

107 




blance to my mother,” I object. 

‘‘Isn’t it?” 

‘‘Well,” I say generously, ‘‘I 
suppose it’s the best you can do. I 
mean, not having anything to go on 
except, I guess, my description of 
her.” 

‘‘The picture,” says Sigfrid 
gently enough, ‘‘was assembled 
from your description of the girl 
Susie Hereira.” 

I light another cigarette, with 
some difficulty, because my hand is 
shaking. “Wow,” I say, with real 
admiration. ‘‘I take my hat off to 
you, Sgifrid. That’s very interest- 
ing. Of course,” I go on, suddenly 
feeling irritable, ‘‘Susie was, my 
God, only a child! Apart from that I 
realize — I realize now, I mean — that 
there, are some resemblances. But 
the age is all wrong.” 

“Bob,” says Sigfrid, “how old 
was your mother when you were lit- 
tle?” 

‘‘She was very young.” I add 
after a moment, ‘‘As a matter of 
fact, she looked a lot younger than 
she was even.” 

Sigfrid lets me hang there for a 
moment, and then he waves his 
hand again and the figure disap- 
pears, and instead we are suddenly 
looking at a picture of two Fives 
butted lander to lander in midspace, 
and beyond them is — is — 

‘‘Oh, my God, Sigfrid,” I say. 

He waits me out for a while. 

As far as I am concerned, he can 
wait forever; I simply do not know 
what to say. I am not hurting, but I 
am paralyzed. I cannot say anything 
and I cannot move. 

“This,” he begins, speaking very 
softly and gently, ‘‘is a reconstruc- 
tion of the two ships in your expedi- 

108 



tion in the vicinity of the object 
SAG YY. It is a black hole or, 
more accurately, a singularity in a 
state of extremely rapid rotation.” 

‘ 7 know what it is, Sigfrid. ’ ’ 
“Yes. You do. Because of its ro- 
tation, the translation velocity of 
what is called its event threshhold 
or Schwarzchild discontinuity ex- 
ceeds the speed of light, and so it is 
not properly black; in fact it can be 
seen by virtue of what is called 
Cerenkov radiation. It was because 
of the instrument readings on this 
and other aspects of the singularity 
that your expedition was awarded a 
ten million dollar bonus in addition 
to the agreed-upon sum which, 
along with certain other lesser 
amounts, is the foundation of your 
present fortune.” 

“I know that too, Sigfrid.” 

Pause. 

“Would you care to tell me what 
else you know about it. Bob?” 
Pause. 

“I’m not sure I can, Sigfrid.” 
Pause again. 

He isn’t even urging me to try. 
He knows that he doesn’t have to. I 
want to try, and I take my cue from 
his own manner. There is something 
in there that I can’t talk about, that 
scares me even to think about; but 
wrapped around that central terror 
there is something I can talk about, 
and that is the objective reality. 

“I don’t know how much you 
know about singularities, Sigfrid.” 
“Perhaps you can just say what 
you think it is that I ought to know. 
Bob.” 

I put out the current cigarette and 
light another one. “Well,” I say, 
“you know and I know that I really 
wanted to know about singularities

it’s all in the data banks some- 
where, and a lot more exactly and 
informatively than I can say it, but 
anyway. The thing about black 
holes is they’re traps. They bend 
light. They bend time. Once you’re 
in you can’t get out. Only — 
Only — ” 

After a moment Sigfrid says, 
“It’s all right for you to cry if you 
want to. Bob,’’ which is the way 
that I suddenly realize that that’s 
what I’m doing. 

“Jesus,” I say, and blow my 
nose into one of the tissues that he 
always keeps handy right next to 
the mat. He waits. 

“Only I did get out,” I say. 

And Sigfrid does something else I 
had never expected from him; he 
permits himself a joke. “That,” he 
says, “is pretty obvious, from the 
fact that you’re here.” 

“This is bloody exhausting, Sig- 
frid,” I say. 

“I am sure it is for you. Bob.” 

“I wish I had a drink.” 

Click. “The cabinet behind 
you,” says Sigfrid, “that has just 
opened contains some rather good 
sherry. It isn’t made from grapes. 
I’m sorry to say; the health service 
doesn’t go in for luxuries. But I 
don’t think you’ll be aware of its 
natural-gas origins. Oh, and it is 
laced with just a dollop of THC to 
soothe the nerves.” 

“Holy Christ,” I say, having ruh 
out of ways of expressing surprise. 
The sherry is all he says it is, and I 
can feel the warmth of it expanding 
inside me. 

“Okay,” 1 say, setting the glass 
down. “Well. WTien I got back to

tions off. We were almost a year 



Question. What did the 
Heechee eat? 

Prof. Hegramet. About what we 
do, I would say. Everything. I 
think they were omnivores, ate 
anything they could catch. We 
really don't know a thing about 
their diet, except that you can 
make some deductions from the 
shell missions. 

Question. Shell missions? 

Prof. Hegramet. There are at 
least four recorded missions that 
didn't go as far as another star, 
but went clear out of the solar 
system. Out where the shell of 
comets hangs out, you know, half 
a light-year or so away. They're 
marked as failures, but I don't 
think they are. I've been pushing 
the Board to give science bonuses 
for them. Three seemed to wind 
up in meteorite swarms. The other 
came out at a comet, all hundreds 
of A.U.'s out. Meteorite swarms, of 
course, are usually the debris of 
old, dead comets. 

Question. Are you saying the 
Heechee ate comets? 

Prof. Hegramet. Ate the things 
comets are made out of. Do you 
know what they are? Carbon, 
oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen — the 
same elements you ate for break- 
fast. I think they used comets for 
feedstocks to manufacture what 
they ate. I think one of those 
missions to the cometary shell 
is sooner or later going to turn 
up a Heechee food factory, and 
then maybe we won't have any- 
body ever starving anywhere any 
more.

overdue. Because we’d been almost 
inside the event horizon. Do you 
understand about time dila- 
tion? . Oh, never mind,” I say, 
before he can answer, ‘‘that was a 
rhetorical queston. What I mean is, 
what happened was the phenomenon 
they call time dilation. You get that 
close to a singularity and you come 
up against the twin paradox. What 
was maybe a quarter of an hour for 
us was almost a year by clock 
time — clock time on Gateway, or 
here, or anywhere else in the non- 
relativistic universe, I mean. 
And—” 

I take another drink, then I go on 
bravely enough: 

‘‘And if we’d gone any farther 
down we would have been going 
slower and slower. Slower, and 
slower, and slower. A little closer, 
and that fifteen minutes would have 



turned out to be a decade. A little 
closer still, and it would have been 
a century. It was that close, Sigfrid. 
We were almost trapped, all of us. 
‘‘But I got out.” 

And I think of something and 
look at my watch. ‘‘Speaking of 
time, my hour’s been up for the last 
five minutes!” 

‘‘I have no other appointments 
this afternoon. Bob.” 

I stare. ‘‘What?” 

Gently: ‘‘I cleared my calendar 
before your appointment. Bob.” 
i don’t say ‘‘Holy Christ” again, 
but I surely think it. ‘‘That makes 
me feel right up against the wall, 
Sigfrid!” I say angrily. 

‘‘I am not forcing you to stay 
past your hour. Bob. I am only 
pointing out that you have that op- 
tion if you choose.” 

I mull that for a while.

Dear Voice of Gateway: 

On Wednesday of last 
week I was crossing the 
parking lot at the Safeway 
Supermarket (where I had 
gone to deposit my food 
I stamps) on the way to the 
shuttle bus to my 
apartment, when I saw an 
unearthly green light. A 
It strange spacecraft landed 
i; nearby. Four beautiful , 

I but very tiny, young women 
in filmy white robes 
I emerged and sub j ected me 
' helpless by means of a 
paralyzing ray. They kept 
me prisoner on their craft 
for nineteen hours. During 
that time they subjected 
me to certain indignities 
of a sexual nature which I 
am honor-bound not to 
reveal. The leader of the 
four, whose name was Moira 
Glow-Fawn, stated that. 



like us, they have 
succeeded in fully 
overcoming their animal 
heritage. I accepted their 
apology and agreed to 
deliver four messages to 
Earth. Messages One and 
Four I may not announce 
until the proper time. 
Message Two is a private 
one for the manager of my 
apartment project. 

Message Three is for you 
at Gateway, and it has 
three parts: 1, there must 
be no more cigarette 
smoking. 2, there must be 
no more mixed schooling of 
boys and girls at least 
until the second year of 
college. 3, you must stop 
all exploration of space 
at once. We are being 
watched . 

Harry Hellison, 
Pittsburgh . 



“You are one brassbound ring- 
ding of a computer, Sigfrid,” I say. 
“All right. Well, you see, there 
was no way we could get out, con- 
sidered as a unit. Our ships were 
caught, well inside the point of no 
return, and there just ain’t no way 
home from there. But old Danny 
A., he was a sharp article. And he 
knew all about the loopholes in the 
laws. Considered as a unit, we were 
stuck. 

“But we weren’t a unit! We were 
two ships! And each of them came 
apart into two other ships! And if 
we could somehow transfer acceler- 
ation from one part of our system to 
the other — you know, kick part of 
us deeper into the well and at the 

GATEWAY 



same time kick the other part up 
and out — then part of the unit could 
go free!’’ 

Long pause. 

“Why don’t you have another 
drink. Bob?’’ says Sigfrid solicit- 
ously. “After you finish crying, I 
mean.” 

XXX 

Fear! There was so much terror 
jumping around inside my skin that 
I couldn’t feel it any more; my 
senses were saturated with it; I 
don’t know if I screamed or bab- 
bled, I only did what Danny A. told 
me to do. We’d backed the two 
ships together and linked up, lander 
to lander, and we were trying to

We sometimes get squashed, 
and we sometimes get burned, 

And we sometimes get 
shredded to bits. 

And we sometimes get fat 
on the Royalties Earned, 

And we’re always scared 
out of oLir'wits. 

We don’t care which — 

Little lost Heechee, 
start making us rich! 

manhandle gear, instruments, 
clothes, everything that moved out 
of the first ship into whatever cor- 
ners we could find of the second, to 
make room for ten people where 
five were a tight fit. Hhnd to hand, 
back and forth, we bucket-brigaded 
the stuff. Dane Metchnikov’s kid- 
neys must have beep kicked black 
and blue; he was the one who was 
in the landers, changing the fuel- 
metering switches to blow every 
drop of hydrox at once. Would we 
survive that? We had no way of 
knowing. Both our Fives were ar- 
mored, and we didn’t expect to 
damage the Heechee-metal shells. 
But the contents of the shells would 
be us, all of us in the one of them 
that went free — or we hoped would 
go free — and there wasn’t really any 
way to tell whether we could come 
free in the first place, or whether 
what would come free would be 
nothing but jelly anyway. And all 
we had was minutes, and not very 
many of them. I guess I passed 
Klara twenty times in ten minutes, 
and I remember that once, the first 

112 



time, we kissed. Or aimed at each 
other’s lips, and came close 
enough. I remember the smell of 
her, and once lifting my head be- 
cause the musk-oil was so strong 
and not seeing her, and then forget- 
ting it again. And all the time, out 
of one viewscreen or another, that 
immense broad baleful blue ball 
hung flickering outside; the racing 
shadows across its surface that were 
phase effects made fearful pictures; 
the griping grab of its gravity waves 
tugged at our guts. Danny A. was 
in the capsule of the first ship, 
watching the time and kicking bags 
and bundles down to the lander 
hatch to pass on, through the hatch, 
through the landers, up to the cap- 
sule of the second ship where I was 
pushing them out of the way, any 
which way, just to make room for 
more. “Five minutes,” he’d yell, 
and “Four minutes!,” and "'Three 
minutes, get the goddamn lead 
out!” and then, “That’s it! All of 
you! Drop what you’re doing and 
come on up here.” And we did. All 
of us. All but me. 1 could hear the 
others yelling, and then calling to 
me; but I’d fallen behind, our own 
lander was blocked, I couldn’t get 
through the hatch! And I tugged 
somebody’s duffelbag out of the 
way, just as Klara was screaming 
over the TBS radio, “Bob! Bob, for 
God’s sake, get up here!” And 1 
knew I was too late; and I slammed 
the hatch and dogged it down, just 
as I heard Danny A.’s voice shout- 
ing, “No! No! Wait. .” 

Wait. 

Wait for a very, very long time.

After a while, I don’t know how

long, I raise my head and say, 
“Sorry, Sigfrid.” 

“For what. Bob?” 

“For crying like this.” I am 
physically exhausted. It is as if I 
had run ten miles through a gauntlet 
of mad Chocktaws pounding me 
with clubs. 

“Are you feeling better now. 
Bob?” 

“Better?” 1 puzzle over that 
stupid question for a moment, and 
then 1 take inventory, and, curiously 
enough, I am. “Why, yeah. I 
guess so. Not what you’d call good. 
But better.” 

“Take it easy for a minute. 
Bob.” 

That strikes me as a dumb re- 
mark, and 1 tell him so. I have 
about the energy-level of a small, 
arthritic jellyfish that’s been dead 
for a week; I have no choice but to 
take it easy. 

But I do feel better. “I feel,” I 
say, “as if I let myself feel my 
guilt at last.” 

“And you survived it.” 

I think that over. “I guess I 



did,” I say. 

“Let’s explore that question of 
guilt. Bob. Guilt why?” 

“Because I jettisoned nine people 
to save myself, asshole!” 

“Has anyone ever accused you of 
that? Anyone but yourself, 1 
mean?” 

“Accused?” I blow my nose 
again, thinking. “Well, no. Why 
should they? When I got back I was 
kind of a hero.” I think about 
Shicky, so kind, so mothering; and 
Francy Hereira holding me in his 
arms, letting me bawl, even though 
I’d killed his cousin. “But they 
weren’t there. They didn’t see me 
blow the tanks to get free.” 

“Did you blow the tanks?” 

“Oh, hell Sigfrid,” I say, “I 
don’t know. I was going to. I was 
reaching for the button.” 

“Does it make sense that the but- 
ton in the ship you were planning 
to abandon would actually fire the 
combined tanks in the landers?” 
“Why not? I don’t know. Any- 
way,” I said, “you can’t give me

The only choice was whether some 
of you would die, or all of you 
would. You elected to see that

thought that over. ‘‘Bob,” he says 
carefully, ‘‘I think you’re con-

she’s still alive in there?” 

‘‘They all are! Time has stopped 
for them!”

And queerly, incongruously, I be- 
lieve he is, chips, Heechee circuits, 
holograms and all, and it makes me 
feel good to believe it. 

‘‘You can go any time you want 
to,” he says, getting up and going 
back to his easy chair in the most 
lifelike possible way, even grinning 
at me! ‘‘But I think I would like to 
show you something.” 

My defenses are eroded down to 
nothing. I only say, ‘‘What’s that 
Sigfrid?” 

‘‘That other capability of ours 
that I mentioned. Bob,” he says, 
‘‘the one that we’ve never used. I 
would like to display another pa- 
tient, from some time back.” 

‘‘Another patient?” 

He says gently, ‘‘Look over in 
the comer. Bob. 

I look — 

— and there she is. 

‘‘Klara!” And as soon as I see 
her 1 know where Sigfrid got it; 
from the machine Klara was con- 
sulting back on Gateway. She is 
hanging there, one arm across a file 
rack, her feet lazily floating in air, 
talking earnestly; her broad black 
eyebrows frown and smile, and her 
face grins, and grimaces, and then 
looks sweetly, invitingly relaxed. 

‘‘You can hear what she’s saying 
if you want to. Bob.” 

‘‘Do I want to?” 

‘‘Not necessarily. But there’s 
GALAXY 




nothing in it to be afraid of. She 
loved you, Bob, the best way she 
knew how. The same as you loved 
her. ’ ’ 

I look for a long time, and then I 
say, “Turn her off, Sigfrid. 

In the recovery room I almost fall 
asleep for a moment. I have never 
been so relaxed. 

I wash my face, and smoke 
another cigarette, and then I go out 
into the bright diffuse daylight 
under the Bubble, and it all looks 
so good and so friendly. I think of 
Klara with love and tenderness, and 
in my heart I say good-by to her. 
And then 1 think of S. Ya., with 
whom I have a date for that 
evening — if I’m not already too late 
for it! But she’ll wait; she’s a good 
scout, almost as good as Klara. 

Klara. 

I stop in the middle of the mall, 
and people bump up against me. A 
little old lady in short-shorts toddles 
over to me and says, “Is something 
wrong?’ ’ 

I stare at her, and don’t answer, 
and then I turn around and head 
back for Sigfrid’s office. 

* * * 

There is no one there, not even a 
hologram. I yell, “Sigfrid! Where 
the hell are you?” 

No one. No answer. This is the 
first time I’ve ever been in the room 
when it wasn’t set up. I can see 
what is real and what was hologram 
now; and not much of it is real. 
Powder-metal walls, studs for pro- 
jectors. The mat (real); the cabinet 
with the liquor (real); a few other 
pieces of furniture that I might want 
to touch or use. But no Sigfrid. Not 



even ’the chair he usually sits in. 
“Sigfrid!” 

I keep on yelling, with my heart 
bubbling up in my throat and my 
brain spinning. “Sigfrid!” I 
scream, and at last there is a sort of 
a haze and a flash and there he is in 
his Sigmund Freud suit. 

“Yes, Bob‘.>” 

“Sigfrid, I did murder her! She’s 
gone!” 

“I see that you’re upset. Bob,” 
he says. “Can you tell me what it 
is that’s bothering you?” 

“Upset! I’m worse than upset, 
Sigfrid, I’m a person who killed 
nine other people to save his life! 
Maybe not ‘really!’ Maybe not ‘on 
purpose!’ But in their eyes I killed 
them, as much as in mine!” 

“But Bob,” he says reasonably, 
“we’ve been all over this. She’s 
still alive; they all are. Time has 
stopped for them — ” 

“I know,” I howl. “Don’t you 
understand, Sigfrid? That’s the 
point. I not only killed her. I’m still 
killing her\” 

Patiently: “Do you think what 
you just said is true. Bob? 

"She thinks it is! Now, and 
forever, as long as I live. It isn’t 
years ago that it happened for her. 
It’s only a few minutes, and it goes 
on for all of my life. I’m down 
here, getting older, trying to forget, 
and there’s Klara up there in Sagit- 
tarius YY, floating around like a fly 
in amber!” 

I drop to the bare plastic mat, 
sobbing. Little by little Sigfrid has 
been restoring the whole office, 
patching in this decoration and that. 
There are pihatas hanging over my 
head, and a holopic of Lake Garda 
at Sirmione on the wall.

having fun. 

“Let the pain out, Bob,” Sigfrid 
says gently. “Let it all out.” 

“^^at do you think I’m doingT' 
I roll over on the foam mat, staring 
at the ceiling. “I could get over the 
pain and the guilt, Sigfrid, if she 
could. But for her it isn’t over. 
She’s out tbere, stuck in time.” 

“Go ahead. Bob.” 

“I am going ahead. Every second 
is still the newest second in her 
mind — the second when I threw her 
life away to save my own. I’ll live 
and get old and die before she lives 
past that second, Sigfrid.” 

“Keep going. Bob. Say it all.” 
“She’s thinking I betrayed her, 
and she’s thinking it now\ I can’t 
live with that.” 

There is a very, very long si- 
lence, and at last Sigfrid says: 

“You are, you know.” 

“What?” My mind has gone a 
thousand light-years away. 

“You are living with it. Bob.” 
“Do you call this living?” I 
sneer, wiping my nose with another of 
his million tissues. 

“You respond very quickly to 
anything I say. Bob,” says Sigfrid, 
“and therefore sometimes 1 think 
your response is a counterpunch. 
You parry what I say with words. 
Let me strike home for once. Bob. 
Let this sink in: You are living.” 

“. Well, I suppose I am.” It 
is true enough, it is just not very 
rewarding. 

Another long pause, then: 

“Bob. You know that I am a 
machine. You also know that my 
function is to deal with human feel- 
ings. I cannot feel feelings. But I 
can represent them with models, I 

116 



can analyze them, I can evaluate 
them. I can do this for you. I can 
even do it for myself. I can con- 
struct a paradigm within which I 
can assess the value of emotions. 
Guilt? It is a painful thing; but be- 
cause it is painlul it is a behavior 
modifier. It can influence you to 
avoid guilt-inducing actions, and 
this is a valuable thing for you and 
for society. But you cannot use it if 
you do not feel it.” 

“I do feel it! Jesus Christ, Sig- 
frid, you know I’m feeling it!” 

“I know,” he says, “that now 
you are letting yourself feel it. It is 
out in the open, where you can let 
it woik for you, not buried where it 
can only harm you. That is what I 
am for. Bob. To bring your feelings 
out where you can use them.” 
“Even the bad feelings? Guilt, 
fear, pain, envy?” 

“Guilt. Fear. Pain. Envy. The 
motivators. The modifiers. The 
qualities that I, Bob, do not have, 
except in a hypothetical sense, when 
I make a paradigm and assign them 
to myself for study.” 

There is another pause. I have a 
funny feeling about it. Sigfrid’s 
pauses are usually either to give me 
time to let something sink in, or to 
permit him to compute some com- 
plex chain or argument about me. 
This time I think it is neither of 
them. He is thinking, but not about 
me. And at last says, “So now I 
can answer what you asked me. 
Bob.” 

“Asked you? What was that?” 
“You ask^ me, ‘Do you call this 
living?’ And I answer: ‘Yes. It is 
exactly what I call living. And in 
my best hypothetical sense, I envy 
it very much.’ ” ★

PROMISES AND A POTPOURRI 



There’s a world Science Fiction 
Convention next week and I’ve got 
to go because I’m chaircritter of 
two panels. I’m behind on two 
novels, the telephone won’t stop 
ringing, and my editor’s in town to 
tell me that if I don’t finish his 
book according to contract he’ll put 
out a contract on me. And Jim Baen 
just ealled to say this column must 
be in before the Worldcon . 

If you think a writer’s life is one 
of quiet laziness punctuated at in- 
frequent intervals by flurries of typ- 
ing, you’re partly right. I can re- 
member those dear dead days when 
I could read my magazines and 
work when I felt like it — but now 
it’s time to pay for the privilege, 
and it’s only fair to make you 
Galaxy readers pay too. After 
all, one way I use up time is an- 
swering letters — and incidentally, to 
those whose letters don’t get an- 
swered, you have my sincere 
apologies. 

You may even get an answer one 

118 



of these days. My desk consists of 
stratified layers of paper, and some- 
times when I can’t stand it any 
longer I conduct an archeological ex- 
pedition down to wood — and thus 
are cast to the surface letters placed 
on my desk as warranting a better 
answer than a one-minute postcard, 
only to be covered by something 
else that shouldn’t be forgotten . 

The way you will pay is this; my 
column this month consists of bits 
and pieces which might, with 
enough ingenuity, be woven into a 
theme, but since I haven’t time 
you’re getting an intellectual pot- 
pourri. 

* * * 

One reason I ran out of time was 
that the Avalon Hill Company has 
sent me (no doubt with malice 
aforethought) a copy of their new 
war games. Starship Troopers. It is, 
of course, based on Robert Hein- 
lein’s story, and carries not only his 

GALAXY 



letter of endorsement, but in the 
manual of rules has memorabilia of 
Lt. Juan Rico, MI (complete with 
his photograph, excerpts from let- 
ters he received, etc.) 

If you like war games, or if you 
like science fiction, or if you hate 
both but liked Starship Trooper, 
you’ll love this. I wouldn’t have 
thought that the complexities of war 
as related by Mr. Heinlein could be 
turned into a set of rules, but Av- 
alon Hill has done it. There are a 
series of games of increasing com- 
plexity; the early ones are playable 
because my son and I tried them 
(well, I had to try it before 1 could 
give A-H an authoritative comment, 
didn’t 1?), but I suspect that the 
later scenarios are playable only by 
fanatics who possess a computer, a 
General Staff, and a great deal of 
time, No matter: the earlier and less 
complex scenarios are fun. If you’re 
looking for a present for a 
(chronologically or temperamen- 
tally) teenaged friend, I recommend 
this; and if your friend hasn’t read 
the book, get that too. The package 
would have overjoyed me in the 
days of my youth. Of course I’m a 
bit old for that sort of thing now 
. Eh? What’s that, it’s my 
move? Be right there. 

* * * 

I have noticed that the gaming 
mania seems to have swept the sci- 
ence fiction community; at every 
convention there are about as many 



games sold in the huckster rooms as 
there are books. One of those mad- 
nesses is a thing called Dungeons 
and Dragons, which seems to be a 
form of collective psychoses com- 
plete with audio-visual hallucina- 
tions. The worst of it is, I once, 
flippantly I’ll swear, remarked that 
it might be interesting to take an 
expedition of mercenary troops — 
commanded by Colonel John Christ- 
ian Falkenberg, of course — into one 
of those dungeons. 

(Confucius say he who does not 
toot own bassoon, same will not be 
tooted. About the time this column 
is on the stands Pocket Books will 
have out The Mercenary by 
Jerry Poumelle, which is a collec- 
tion of most of the published Fal- 
kenberg stories plus about 40 pages 
of original material including the 
marching song of the Line 
Marines.) 

I’m told that a committee of 
Dungeonmasters has taken me up 
on the challenge, and at some point 
in the near future I will be invited 
to send Falkenberg ’s 42nd Legion 
into a world of dragons, wizards, 
elves, balrogs, vampires, and vari- 
ous forms of slimes, molds, death 
spells, etc. 1 can hardly wait, and 
meantime the regimental armorer is 
casting silver bullets and filling Flit 
guns with carbolic acid . 

All this wouldn’t have used up so 
much time, but of course there’s 
Viking. We had quite a party on 
July 20, 1976. Larry and Marilyn 
Niven, myself, Poul and Karen An-

derson, Ted and Wina Sturgeon, 
Robert and Virginia Heinlein, and 
Ray Bradbury were all at JPL to 
watch the landing. It came at an 
ungoldly hour, but no one really 
noticed that. We were too busy star- 
ing at the screen as, line by line, 
the image built up: a close-up look 
at the surface of Mars. 

As Mr. Heinlein said, July 20 is 
likely to be an important date in 
human history for quite a long time 
to come. First Eagle, then 
Viking — and you know, with no 
intent to be unpatriotic at all, I 
agree with Robert: mankind may 
well remember the significance of 
July 20 a long time after most 
people have forgotten why July 4 is 
important. 

As I write this. Viking II hasn’t 
landed yet (it’s scheduled to touch 
down during the World Convention, 
alas) and nobody knows what to 
make of the information streaming 
in from the first lander. The biology 
team can’t figure it out, and the 
geology people are having small fits 
of their own. 

Biology: Tf we got these results 
from a sample picked up on Earth 
we wouldn’t hesitate to say they in- 
dicated biological activity.” 

Geology: “No, we don’t have the 
slightest idea why the Martian soil 
has that consistency. No, it’s not 
water. No, it’s not ...” 

The biological question will 
probably be resolved one way or 
another by the time you read this. 
The soil consistency question prob- 

120 



ably won’t be. The Martian desert 
landscape looks sandy. We know 
there’s dust. And yet, the sampler 
arm digs its little trench — and the 
trench remains. It doesn’t crumble 
at the edges. The soil sample has a 
consistency of lumpy clay, yet 
there’s no water to hold it together. 
Why isn’t it sandy, fine-grained? 
You haven’t the time to listen to the 
theories proposed, and none I’ve 
heard account for all the data. 

And why is that surprising? It’s 
another planet. It ought to be 
strange, different, unusual, weird 
even. Yet we are surprised; and 
that’s worth thinking about. 

We have come to expect marvels 
from science and technology, and 
particularly from the space program. 
Ted Sturgeon — and others, so many 
others that I haven’t a clue as to 
who said it first, but possibly 
Ted — has said that NASA’s greatest 
miracle was to make Mankind’s 
most magificent achievement dull. 
We achieved so much that the 
miraculous became routine. There’s 
excitement, all right — I was 
privileged to attend some of the 
Viking scientific steering meetings 
at JPL, and there was intellectual 
gore enough for anyone — but it 
doesn’t get out to the public. 

Yet think about it. Here’s this 
enormously sophisticated machine 
flung across millions of miles of 
space, landing with no more impact 
than you’d feel jumping off a chair; 
it sends back highly detailed photo- 
graphs, using in transmission about 

GALAXY 




the energy of the light-bulb in your 
desk-lamp, and getting that power 
from tiny radioactive-isotope- 
generating systems; it digs holes in 
the Martian landscape and subjects 
them to tests not even possible on 
Earth when I was in school; it’s 
done all that for less than one per- 
cent of one year’s worth of the na- 
tional budget — about $4.50 for each 
of us in these United States; and we 
expected it to work, first crack. 

So far have we come. I recently 
read a history of Polar exploration. 
Attempt after attempt, each one get- 
ting closer, each ending in failure, 
some in tragedy, until the final 
triumph; and each failure spurred 
renewed effort. I sometimes wonder 
if the greatest tragedy of our space 



program was that we had so little 
tragedy. Would we have seen 
Apollo as more splendid if space 
had killed more heroes? 

Since a lot of those people were 
friends of mine, and it was my Job 
(along with a lot of others) to see 
that they came home healthy, 1 
never did nor ever could wish for 
tragedy in space; but might not the 
public take more interest in our 
achievements if we had not been so 
routinely successful? 

In my columns and lectures I 
often tell of the marvels about to be 
poured forth from technology’s cor- 
nucopia. I describe a world of the 
future with colonies in space, min- 
erals brought from the asteroids, a 
world-wide standard of living at

least as high as what we in the 
United States enjoy now; and I am 
careful to say that I am not describ- 
ing dreams. This is the world as it 
can be made, as we already know 
how to make it. We can do it, I 
say. And it doesn’t even cost much: 
a few more cents out of each tax 
dollar. 

I gave that lecture in Salt Lake 
City recently. (Salt Lake City is the 
only place I’ve ever visited where 
the words “wild life’’ refer exclu- 
sively to ecological phenomena.) 
After the question period I stood 
talking with some of my audience, 
and a young lady asked a very seri- 
ous question. “You tell us about all 
the benefits technology can bring 
us, and you say you only need a lit- 
tle more money to accomplish all 
these marvels. I’m not an engineer. 
I don’t even understand about half 
of what you said in there. I’d like 
to believe you, but — how do I know 
you can do it if we give you the 
money?’’ 

It was asked in all sincerity. Most 
of my audience wasn’t technically 
trained, and indeed in this case 
weren’t even very familiar with sci- 
ence fiction, and though I’ve evi- 
dence they were entertained, I knew 
too that some of the things I’d 
talked about were unfamiliar. I 
could probably convince an en- 
gineer or mathematician or 
economist that my forecasts make 
sense; but how to prove to a bright 
young English teacher that I wasn’t 
just blowing smoke, that it wasn’t 

122 



all just promises, promises? 

I had to say something, and I 
heard myself saying this: “Of those 
who make you promises, which 
group has a better track record for 
keeping them: technologists or 
politicians?’’ She seemed satisfied; 
and later I reflected on just what I’d 
said. It makes more sense than I 
knew. 

Remember twenty years ago 
when the politicians and “social 
scientists’’ were saying that if only 
they had as much money as the De- 
fense Department, they would trans- 
form America into Paradise? Well, 
they’ve got what they asked for and 
a lot more. I can recall when Con- 
gress dared not bring in a budget 
larger than the “barrier” figure of 
$100 billion. Now there’s no obvi- 
ous stopping point short of a 
trillion — and not much of the in- 
crease went to Defense. Do we live 
in Paradise? 

In 1958 some of us said that if 
we could have about 3% of the na- 
tional budget we could put men on 
the Moon and go to the planets. We 
said that the nation would reap great 
benefits from communications and 
weather satellites, and that the fer- 
ment of high-technology enterprises 
generated by the space program 
would have unforseeable effects of 
enormous benefit to all. Have those 
promises been kept? 

In the 50’ s advocates of “federal 
aid to education” were saying that 
if we merely shoveled a bit more 
money into education we’d not only 

GALAXY 




see that every Johnny could read, 
but produce a generation fit to live 
in “the atomic age”. Well, educa- 
tion certainly can’t complain that it 
didn’t get far more than was asked 
for (asked for then; not as much as 
is wanted now, of course); but 
would anyone like seriously to 
argue that we have fewer problems 
with the schools now than we did 
then? 

And no: I do not mean this as a 
condemnation of educators and 
politicians and social scientists. I do 
not mean to imply that there may be 
serious problems not forseen by 
those forcasters of the 50’s. I don’t 
even mean to condemn those who 
tell us what’s needed is still more 
money for education and social ser- 
vices and the like. I do mean this: 
of those who have said they could 
produce certain results given certain 
investments, who has the best track 
record? And yes, I know about cost 
over-runs (back in my aerospace 
days I was mildly famous for Pour- 
nelle’s Law of Costs and Schedules, 
namely, “Everything takes longer 
and costs more,” a dictum discov- 
ered independently by myself and 
Poul Anderson). 

I could even tell you horror 
stories of my own. Some of them 
aren’t the engineers’ fault, though. 
Freeman Dyson told me about the 
laser target, the one placed on the 
Moon by Neil Armstrong: essen- 
tially a box full of glass cubes. 
They asked the instrument makers 
at Princeton what it would cost, and 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



were told a couple of thousand dol- 
lars at most; by the time the com- 
petitive bid process was done, the 
cost was about a quarter of a mil- 
lion. But sometimes the engineers 
and technology managers seriously 
underestimate their costs, and seri- 
ously over-estimate the results. 
Sometimes they build outright fail- 
ures, bridges that fall down and- 
airplanes that don’t fly very well. 
But he honest. How often have we 
been given an order of magnitude 
more money and failed to produce 
the promised result? Or any result at 
all? And how many political pro- 
grams do you know of that cost ten 
times as much as estimated, are 
seemingly eternal in duration, and 
produce no measurable result at all? 

Choose your own examples; I’d 
not like to pick on your favorite 
project for social improvement. I do 
recall Dr. Samual Johnson on the 
subject. 

Boswell: “Then, sir, you laugh at 
schemes for social improvement?” 

Johnson: “Whj^, sir, most 

schemes for social improvement are 
very laughable things.” 

And yet in my youth no one 
laughed when we were told that for 
$200 billion — not annually, but just 
$200 billion — we could transform 
the world, and they did indeed 
' laugh when told that we could go to 
the Moon at any price whatever. 

I rest my case. 

I can’t drop the subject of prom- 
ises and Dr. Freeman Dyson, 
though. 



123 




* * * 

I suspect that few Galaxy 
readers ever heard of “Recombinant 
DNA Research,” but the subject is 
likely to be of vast importance to all 
of us, and it won’t be long before it 
gets into the political headlines; in- 
deed, by ‘the time this is published 
it may be the question of the hour 
for your local city council or county 
board of supervisors. 

Last July the Cambridge Mass, 
city council found itself required to 
debate and rule on whether to allow 
DNA research at Harvard University 
and MIT; and those are hardly the 
only institutions whose biologists 
are eager to get to work. 

DNA, or D-Nucleic Acid is the 
long-chain spiral molecule that de- 
termines genetics and inheritance, 
and it takes many forms. Recently 
biologists have learned how to take 
DNA from one plant or animal and 
make it combine with DNA from 
reproductive cells of entirely differ- 
ent species. 

The results can be strange. 
“Plantimals,” neither plant nor 
animal, have been produced. 
Grotesque cells combining DNA 
from both human and mouse have 
survived to multiply by simple fis- 
sion. More importantly, new forms 
of bacteria with properties of more 
than one of the species that went 
into their genesis have emerged 
from the laboratories. 

Recombinant DNA research will, 
some biologists tell us, teach us 

124 



more about life and biology than 
everything man has learned since 
the beginning of time. The results 
can be highly practical. In a recent 
letter to Science magazine Dr. 
Freeman Dyson (Institute for Ad- 
vanced Study) said: 

“I claim that the exploitation of 
recombinant DNA techniques may 
lead to an understanding, and con- 
ceivably a cure, of cancer ... to 
creation of improved food plants to 
save hundreds of millions of people 
from starvation ... to energy crops 
to offer alternatives to nuclear fis- 
sion and fossil fuels.” 

Many biologists agree. Some 
predict even greater benefits. Cer- 
tainly the potential good from re- 
combinant DNA research is not 
small. 

The trouble is, equally prestigious 
scientists are terrified. The Cam- 
bridge city council didn’t get into 
the debate because of anti- 
intellectual feeling. Men as reputa- 
ble as Dyson explained the dangers 
and demanded the hearings. 

Much of the DNA research is 
done with a bacteria called E. coli, 
which is universally present in 
human intestines. Suppose the re- 
search produces a bug which can 
live in humans — E. coli is admira- 
bly adapted for that — and gives ev- 
eryone typhus? Recombinant DNA 
could conceivably unleash an en- 
tirely new disease for which we 
have neither cure nor natural im- 
munity. It might produce a cancer- 
causing bug which, once released, 

GALAXY 




could never be exterminated. 

It might solve the problem of 
famine, but not quite in the way 
advocates of recombinant DNA re- 
search hope for. 

Advocates of DNA research 
admit all this, but point out that 
after two years of study the Na- 
tional Institutes of Health have re- 
leased guidelines for such research, 
and these are more than adequate to 
protect the public. The most 
dangerous kinds of research, those 
involving organisms that might af- 
fect human health, must be done in 
completely sealed environments 
such as were used by the Army for 
biological warfare research before 
the United States terminated those 
programs. 

They also say you can’t stop it: 
the techniques are complex, but the 
equipment isn’t that expensive, so 
some researchers will do the work 
whether permitted or not. Better, 
they say, to have it under license 
and supervision. After all, a moder- 
ately well-equipped high school 
laboratory could support recombi- 
nant DNA research although certainly 
not safely. 

1 hear tales of virus-bacteria 
combinations which weren’t sup- 
posed to be viable but inexplicably 
were, and which lived on human 
tissue-cultures until destroyed. I 
don’t know if the stories are tme, 
but my biochemistry friends tell me 
it’s not impossible. The dangers, 
like the benefits, are not small, and 
are very real. 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



We have here a legitimate dis- 
agreement among scientists of high 
integrity and great stature; and it is 
a question which must be answered 
by the general public and our politi- 
cal institutions. If there’s a final an- 
swer to this question, I don’t know 
it. I think both sides are right: the 
potential benefits are enormous, but 
the potential hazards are equally so. 
For what it’s worth I think the dan- 
gers of disaster are far less probable 
than the promise of blessings, and 
I’ve some confidence in the 
techniques proposed to isolate and 
control any resulting demon; but no 
one can be 100% certain. 

The Army took prodigious mea- 
sures to keep its research safe and 
confined (as well as secret) but 
there were accidents. Sheep died in 
Colorado. Improbable that (1) any- 
thing would get out, (2) if it did it 
could live, and (3) if it got out and 
lived it would be virulent and (4) 
uncontrollable; but that multiple 
probability is not ?ero. 

My own suggestion (one which 
Jim Baen guessed when I outlined 
the problem and before I made my 
suggestion) is that the truly danger- 
ous activities ought to be put off 
until we can do the work in orbiting 
laboratories or on the Moon. Then 
we can be sure that an accidental 
release of research organisms won’t 
contaminate the Earth. But — can we 
wait that long? Suppose there is 
famine on the Earth, and we find 
later that had we started the re- 
search this year a famine-preventing 

125 




grain would have been found in 
time? Would not the responsibility 
for millions dead of starvation 
weigh heavily on those who played 
it safe? 

I knpw this: if we had continued 
the space program as we ought to 
have continued it, instead of con- 
verting the money into fuel to feed 
political premises, we’d have those 
orbiting labs, aye and a Moon base 
as well. 

Meanwhile, in nearly every large 
university the biologists are tooling 
up; and except for the Cambridge 
city council, which until a month 
ago had never heard of Recombi- 
nant DNA, the state and local au- 
thorities haven’t even considered the 
problem. 

\ 

★ ^ * 

One last item for our intellectual 
chicken soup: do you grieve for en- 
dangered species? Do you mourn 
the passing of even the insignifi- 
cant, believe that nothing should 
ever be totally exterminated? Then I 
have a candidate for your defense 
efforts. 

This year, 1977, will see the ex- 
tirpation of the smallpox virus. As I 
write this, smallpox, which a few 
years ago claimed millions of lives 
each year, now exists only in 
laboratories and in one small vil- 
lage in Ethiopia; in a year the only 
living virus will be in the 
laboratories. 

Already we no longer vaccinate 
children in the U.S. The (small) 

126 



danger of unfavorable reaction to 
the vaccination is greater than the 
danger of smallpox. The WHO has 
removed the requirement for current 
vaccination from the medical 
passport. 

But shall we preserve samples of 
the virus? Surely Pournelle jests? 
No. There are serious proposals that 
we preserve this endangered species. 

The argument is that smallpox 
virus is one of the few viruses which 
live only in man. (It has, so far as 
we know, no animal reservoir and 
no vector save man-to-man contact, 
which is why it could be eradicated 
in such a short time.) Would it not 
be well to preserve samples of this 
virus that lives only in man, so we 
can find out why it picks on us and 
nothing else? Were we to leam that 
characteristic might it not be 
enormously valuable? Might it not, 
if isolated from the disease-causing 
characteristics, be a useful gene to 
breed into other viruses which we 
hope to create from recombinant 
DNA research? And so forth. 

Others say, to the Devil with the 
the pox! and reach for the carbolic 
acid. 

I suppose I could have woven a 
theme into this intellectual porridge 
after all. How are those not of a 
technical bent to live in a world of 
science and technology? And of the 
promises, promises, whose shall 
they believe? I wish I had final an- 
swers to those questions; I do not. 
But I’m not at all sorry I’ve made 
you think about them. ★ 



GALAXY 





Only yours. Lover. 



Ben sharayde paused on the 
mica-flecked walkway while his 
eyes adjusted from the dimness of 
the transpod. The street, at ten- 
thirty on a workday morning, was 
full of strolling people; he missed 
the purposeful rush. 

It was an oddly heady feeling to 
walk through* the diffracted sunlight 
that penetrated the dome’s crust of 
winter grime, to note that it was 
time for spring cleaning: as if in his 
transitory importance he could order 
it done. Sharayde smiled at his own 
conceit. 

A passing semireg eyed him with 
open envy, contrasting his own 
dull-tan uniform to the iridescent 
navy skinsuit and scarlet-ruffled 
vestjac Ben had donned for the bris- 
tening. He’d looked exactly right; 
and he’d acted as casually blase as 
if he’d been honored before. 

He didn’t even have to hurry. 
Paul Savin had been glad to allow 
him the morning off; indeed, he 
might have been willing to excuse 
him for the entire day, so impressed 
was he that Ben was to name not 
one, but two infants. Only 
Citycouncilman Mayer had outgun- 
ned him with three boys. Ben found 
he was grinning with unconscious 
pride, and carefully blanked his ex- 
pression. No use attracting attention 
from the service workers heading 
for late-morning half-shifts, the 
tourists clumped before store win- 
dows in their oddly fashioned out- 
city clothing, or the uniformed Cops 
alert at their staggered posts. 

128 



A hoarse shout and a shove snap- 
ped him from his reverie; he looked 
up to see a workcrew gravving 
down the wall while the burly man 
beside him yelled instructions. They 
hit the pavement with a clatter, and 
commenced to slam their rig into its 
powercrate with a violence that 
made Ben, used to fragile artist’s 
implements, wince. The strawboss 
ignored them, staring up at the win- 
dowless expanse of brick and wav- 
ing. 

There was a snap and a low hum: 
like a shimmering curtain, a porno 
swept across the building. 

The girl posing in the wall was 
honeyblonde, lightly bronzed, her 
long face accented by dark brows 
and arched, patrician nose. She 
smiled with knowing lips. Erect, 
fully curved, her body avoided the 
satchel-bottomed sensuality common 
among models. Her message tapped 
Ben’s ears as he strolled past her 
mil-thick essence: “ONLY 

YOURS, lover.” An erotic emotive 
enhanced his reaction. 

Shebinoff handled the Only 
Yours account; where had he found 
her? Ben made a mental note to 
seek Sheb out at lunch and compli- 
ment him. It would also provide a 
perfect opportunity to remind his 
co-workers where he’d been this 
morning, and receive their envious 
congratulations. 

Already the wallad had gathered 
a small crowd. A tall black in a 
gold skinsuit stopped abruptly in 
front of Ben, who sidestepped into 

GALAXY 




a stocky man whose sombre kilt 
marked him an outcity tourist. The 
tourist glared. Ben excused himself, 
stepped back, was jostled forward, 
bumped the heavily-muscled black, 
and worked himself out of the 
crush. 

Exciting as the ad was, he 
needn’t waste time on it. Ben knew 
he was a loner, conspicuous by his 
nonattendance at groupins and 
bashes, but he usually found com- 
panions who were impressed by his 
unconventionality. Just wait till they 
heard about his double honor! 

And there was always Cydra. 

Still, he found something attrac- 
tively artistic in the height of the 
blonde’s forehead, the curve of her 
lips, the depth and timbre of her 
voice. If she was really avail- 
able. .Ben caught himself. It 
was only an ad! One he’d never 
notice ordinarily, hurrying past, 
worried about schedules and ripoffs 
and hustlers. 

Suddenly the half-empty street, 
the alert Cops surveying naive 
tourists and lackadaisical semiregs, 
reminded Ben that this was a high- 
risk district. He was usually too 
rushed, too insulated among 
thousands like himself, to be ner- 
vous about it. 

Savin AdArt occupied the top 
three floors of a grimed stone build- 
ing near the domewall. A few ruins 
crumbled against the dome itself, 
but when the ultraplas hemisphere 
was clean, Sharayde could look 
over them from his studio window 



at foamed, restless ocean. Today, as 
he sat at his desk, he was glad of 
the encrusted spray; he was almost 
too distracted to work, as it was. 

He uncovered the nearly finished 
dimenso on his block and stared at 
it critically. It looked distorted, flat; 
something was wrong with it, some- 
thing as definite yet elusive as a 
touch of ozone in conditioned air, 
or sudje in a liqueur, but he 
couldn’t put his finger on it. He’d 
been satisfied with it last night. 

Mere retouching wouldn’t re- 
vitalize it. His first impulse was to 
strip the block and start fresh, but 
the layout was on deadline. The 
dimensional effect was adequate; no 
more than that, not up to his usual 
standard, but good enough for 
EZSleep, a minor account. It would 
sell. 

He’d add just one hilite layer in- 
stead of the four he’d originally in- 
tended, and call it done. 

* * * 

No new assignment showed up in 
his slot after lunch. Lesser artists 
might be set to filling roughs or ad- 
ding layers of translux to dimensos, 
instead of working on their private 
sketchblocks. To Ben, still glowing 
from his co-workers’ congratula- 
tions, the freedom from scurryboy 
busywork seemed no more than his 
due. His stylo skimmed the block, 
building in unconscious harmony of 
memory and skill the record of his 
morning: the dim, elegant chapel, 
the bored Creche officials, the

black-robed chanter, the debonair 
snob Mayer, the fatuous citizens 
who’d insisted on touching their 
namesakes, trying to wheedle a re- 
sponse from the lightly drugged in- 
fants. Thank god he’d avoided both 
extremes! 

He experimented briefly with pat- 
terns of the domecrust on the walk- 
way, then found himself intently 
sketching the dazed, concentrated 
stare of the corn-rowed black be- 
neath the wallad. 

How would he look, a dark 
naked god, braced on the seawall 
against flying spray? With sunset 
outlining thick, tensed muscles, and 
the wavecrests crimson, and his 
face locked into the force of his de- 
sire? 

It might — ^just might — work into 
something prizeworthy. 

Savin could find a client for it; 
medals weren’t awarded noncom- 
mercial drivel, but he’d never failed 
to back Ben from the time he’d first 
encouraged him to enter the Annual 
Open Artshow, where an Honorable 
Mention in 2182 led to the Alwark 
Invitational. Ben had every reason 
to believe this morning’s honor 
came from the Bronze Medal he’d 
won there. 

The sketch could go no further 
without commercial application. 
Ben stretched stiff shoulders, noting 
the time with astonishment. No one 
had stopped in to remind him of 
quitting time. They probably felt 
shy, after this morning, about inter- 
rupting his work.

If he didn’t leave immediately, 
he’d be caught by mechocleaners at- 
tacking the litter on desks and floor. 
He’d made that mistake just once, 
and nearly lost the ruffles off his 
trousers. 

Domeglow threw menacing 
shadows over the walkway. The 
glowing wallad winked knowingly. 
Few gazing up at it wore citizen’s 
skinsuits. Most nightwalkers were 
nonregs in their shabby, mixed 
garb, hustling a livlihood from 
tourists, the compassionate, and 
each other. The wallad blonde was 
a hustler, too, Ben thought ab- 
sently. It added a spice of danger to 
her appeal. 

Something plucked at the lapel of 
his vestjac. Sharayde slapped at his 
pocket and howled, wringing his 
gashed palm. 

A slim urchin darted down the 
walk, turning with a flash of nar- 
rowed eyes and pale, unchildishly 
snarling lips before dodging behind 
a fat, bundle-burdened woman. 

The boy had slashed his criticard 
right out of his pocket. Ben pointed 
with a blood-dripping hand and yel- 
led, “Stop that ^y! He’s a ripoff!” 

“What boy?’’ the woman yelped, 
dropping her sacks and clutching 
her own pocket. 

“This boy?” A big semireg lifted 
a screaming blonde boy by the 
scruff. Spectators crowded, clutch- 
ing the struggling child. 

“Not him. Taller, darker, close- 
cropped hair. .” 

The semireg shrugged, dropped 

GALAXY 




the child and turned away. 

Ben stood shaking weakly; 
shocked, hurt, marooned, cardless. 
Alone among a crowd whose inter- 
est was gone he felt totally helpless. 

“How bad did he get you, mis- 
ter?” 

Ben suppressed the urge to clutch 
the big, broadfaced Cop for sup- 
port. 

“Benjamin Sharayde,” Ben 
stammered. “He cut me pretty 
deep, I think.” He held out his 
hand but the Cop ignored it. Ben 
fished up a tissue and clumsily 
wrapped the gory cut. “He got my 
card.” 

“Ident, please.” 

Not a word of blame! Encour- 
aged, Ben rattled off his number. 

“You’ll have to come to the sta- 
tion for I.D. and treatment. There’s 
no hope of catching the ripoff here, 
but if you can give a good descrip- 
tion, we may be able to make him. 
We’ve got this area pretty well plot- 
ted.” The Cop took Ben’s elbow 
and half lifted him into the silver 
autocar. 

“I can do better than describe the 
little bastard. I can draw him for 
you,” Ben said grimly. “I got a 
good look at him.” 

“Witnesses always say that. 
Mostly they’re mistaken.” The au- 
tocar hummed down the street- 
guides, slipped through the station 
diaphragm. 

“I’m a working artist. Just give 
me a sketchblock and stylo.” 

“Citizen Benjamin Sharayde,” 

THE WALLAD BLONDE 



the Cop formally informed the Desk- 
man as he helped Ben from the 
car. “I flashed you.” 

“Right. Citicard ripoff. Injured 
hand.” The Deskman punched his 
console, and a young woman hur- 
ried in with a medical float. Ben 
winced as she unwrapped the 
bloody tissue and wiped the slash 
with anesthetic, then turned his at- 
tention to the pen and paper the 
Deskman was offering, and almost 
laughed. They expected him to 
draw on the back of a computer 
run? Still, a real artist could use 
anything, even a cave wall and col- 
ored mud. 

Clips closed his numbed hand; he 
worked with quick strokes, and the 
boy’s lean, leering face glared at 
them from the paper. 

“Lenny Two,” the Cop 
exclaimed as Ben roughed in the 
cropped hair. “Maybe this time we 
can get him before he blanks the 
card!” 

“Does what?” 

“He’s part of a regular gang,” 
the Deskman explained, punching 
buttons. “Run citicards through a 
hand-made processer, and switch 
numbers. Can’t fake the interior cir- 
cuitry, of course, but they’ll pass in 
public slots, transpods, eateries, like 
that; they never let ’em get a real 
inspection.” 

“Just get my card back,” 
Sharayde mumbled dizzily. “I want 
to go home.” 

“We can take you, or you can 
wait here while we track Lenny 

131 




Two. There’s always the chance 
we’ll get him in time. If not, you’ll 
have to open a new account with a 
public declaration. Want to wait? 
You’ve had a busy day, Citizen.” 

The Medic, stowing her apparatus 
in her float, gave him a dazzling 
smile. So they’d looked him up 
when his number came in, found 
that he’d been honored just this 
morning. And was stupid enough to 
lose his card tonight. 

Ben looked up, flushing, but the 
Deskman was already punching data 
on another call. 

“I think you’d better wait,” the 
Medic murmured. ‘‘You’re very 
pale. There’s no reason to hos- 
pitalize you, but it would be wise to 
rest.” 

* * * 

He’d slept soundly enough, Ben 
thought when the Medic woke him. 
He’d been the room’s only occu- 
pant; now many of the beds were full 
of groaning victims. He’d make 
sure not to be caught here again! It 
might even be wise to look for a 
Job in a better district, much as he’d 
hate leaving Savin. 

‘‘We caught Lenny Two, and re- 
covered your citicard. Mister 
Sharayde. Do you feel up to making 
formal identification now, so he can 
be disposed of?” 

Ben nodded sleepily. ‘‘Of course. 
I’d just have to come back tomor- 
row if I didn’t and miss a day’s 
work. I feel a lot better.” He fol- 



lowed the pretty medic through a 
safety door into a white room full 
of black-padded half-reclined 
armchairs lined up on their pedes- 
tals like mushrooms. Slouching, tat- 
tered nonregs, restrained by a single 
wristclamp, sat in the nearer rows, 
staring at them with blank defeated 
eyes. 

On the far side of the room the 
chairs were smaller. Another Cop 
stalked over to intercept them, fin- 
gering his portacomp. (Interchange- 
able Cops in identical uniformed 
bodies, Ben thought dully. Are they 
bred in the Alwark Creche, or do 
we buy them wholesale?) 

‘‘This the bastard that ripped 
you?” 

Lenny Two lay loose and sensu- 
ous in the chair, one arm held by 
the wristclamp, the other limp 
across his lap. His clothing was in 
fragments. Damp dark hair framed 
his softened features, and his limbs 
were childishly slender. 

‘‘That’s the boy, all right. But he 
looks a lot different.” 

The Cop snorted. ‘‘Should have 
seen him when they brought him in! 
Filthy, fighting, foulmouthed little 
biter! Had to sudje him before we 
could even clean him up and book 
him. Well, that’ll take care of it, 
unless you want to. .” he leered 
at Sharayde. ‘‘It’s all right, you 
know.” 

Lenny Two raised half-open, 
seductive eyes. 

‘‘No, thanks,” Sharayde stam- 
mered, astonished to realize he was 



132 



GALAXY 




blushing. “I thought sudje was il- 
legal.” 

“Hospital has a use permit, natu- 
rally. They buy most of these kids 
as S-2 donors, so we start the pro- 
cess here. Makes ’em a lot easier to 
handle.” 

“You did recover my card?” Ben 
asked sharply, suddenly desperate to 
get away. (How potent was the 
sudje? Was the boy drugged beyond 
awareness?) 

“It’s at the desk. How’s your 
hand?” 

“Oh, fine. Which door. .?” 

The Cop laughed harshly. “Tell 
’em it still bothers you, get a free 
ride home. You aren’t safe on the 
street this late.” 

* it 

Ben’s promptcomp woke him 
with bright morning commercials; it 
was his one indulgence, aside from 
his location. (The Cop who drove 
him had been visibly impressed by 
his address: “If I lived here I’d 
never go wallside!”) 

A triple gong insisted he was 
late; the promptcomp must be run- 
ning its program for the second 
time. Ben rested half-focused eyes 
on the holo filling the livingspace 
(the Cop should see how little room 
he could afford — much less 
luxuries) and gathered himself to 
rise. His eyes closed, and the gong 
rang again. He rolled onto his cut 
hand, groaned, and fell to the floor 
in a tangle of bedclothes. 



No time to order a new suit to 
replace the one ripped last night; he 
paid a penalty for oversleeping. 
Nothing in his press looked right for 
the day. Well, dammit, when he 
wore good clothes he got ripped. 
The old gold with the oblique gray 
stripe was good enough for the 
domewall district, anyhow. 

Wincing, he sealed his citicard 
into the breast pocket. He’d have to 
conceal the pain at work, or face a 
multitude of embarrassing questions; 
thank god the clips were nearly in- 
visible. He dragged himself work- 
wards. 

Past the wallad blonde, who 
stretched langurously at his ap- 
proach and licked her lower lip, 
murmuring “ONLY YOURS.” 

Two assignments Jammed his 
slot: a thick and puzzling manu- 
script, and an undescribed full-page 
“Only Yours” dimenso to run in a 
glossy with heavy outcity circula- 
tion. Had Shebinoff fouled up the 
Only Yours account? He’d have to 
check. 

Ben slouched in his chair and 
flipped through the manuscript, 
looking in vain for an explanatory 
note. How did Savin expect him to 
illustrate a thesis, and why? Espe- 
cially since he couldn’t even follow 
the argument? The author wrote an 
esoteric code, possibly clear to 
others in his discipline, but pure 
outish to Ben. 

He shuffled the pages together 
and started again from the top, ab- 
sently doodling as he read. The 

133 



THE WALLAD BLONDE 




high-cheeked, long-eyed face of the 
wallad blonde smirked from his 
pad. If Only Yours was dissatisfied 
with that ad, he was going to be 
hard pressed to excel it; she had 
more than physical attractiveness, 
she promised confidences shared 
and a relationship built together. 

Ben stripped the block, thinking 
of Cydra, the perfect receptacle, 
who listened to him with absorbing 
grace, while retaining nothing on 
the damaged plasm of her brain. He 
tried to imagine telling her of his 
misadventure of last night. She’d 
smile, and lean over for his kiss 
. .no sense, just sensuality. 
Again he’d set lines in the plastop: 
Cydra’s lovely, empty face, with 
the scornful blonde behind her, 
challenging him. 

If Sheb had lost the account, it 
wasn’t bright to copy him. 

Until he could discover where 
Only Yours stood, he’d better work 
on the thesis, though it galled him 
not to understand it. Savin should 
have filled him in. Now he was left 
with only one alternative, distasteful 
but necessary. 

Ben punched a callcode with 
angry jabs. 

A pinched face filled his screen. 
"Taufry? Come over, will you?” 

‘‘Now? I’m busy, you fertile bas- 
tard.” Delighted to get in a dig. 

‘‘C’mon, Tauf. I really need you. 
Just translate some math for me, 
and you can dig yourself back into 
your hole.” 

Will Taufry shrugged, bony 

134 



hands high. ‘‘A minute, then. If 
you keep me. I’ll bill you.” 

‘‘No chance! Catch me letting 
you at my account!” 

The screen died before Ben 
touched it; Paul Savin’s resident 
genius must already be scuttling 
through studio corridors on tiny, de- 
formed feet like a blood-drained 
spider somehow alive after mating. 

Taufry would never be called to a 
bristening, though his semen was 
collected monthly just like everyone 
else’s. Perhaps his defective genes 
were isolated in genetic processing, 
his brilliant mind and sharp, restless 
persona added to some embryonic 
karyotype, but he’d never know 
where, or if, his heritance con- 
tinued. 

For all his scolding. Will Taufry 
took his time studying the manu- 
script, scribbling notes and stripping 
them, tossing his scant hair by re- 
peated thrusts of bony fingers. Fi- 
nally he gathered the papers and 
rammed them carelessly back into 
the envelope. 

‘‘I’m going to have to keep 
these,” he grumbled. ‘‘Might have 
known you’d come up with a 
time- waster.” 

‘‘It wasn’t my idea,” Ben 
fended, upending his own brown 
curls in nervous imitation. ‘‘All I 
want is an explanation. It can’t be 
much of an account. Savin didn’t 
even put in a cover note. Probably 
just needs covers, for publication. 
But the chap writes some language 
all his own.” 



GALAXY 




“Your integrity is showing,’’ 
Taufry teased. “You actually want 
your illustrations to relate to the 
text! You’re right, though; this isn’t 
aimed at the academic community, 
it’s to be popularized, and the illos 
will have to be explanatory. 

“On the surface it looks like an 
anti-genetic proposal. Ironic, to give 
it to a man who just bristened two 
babies! Well, I’ll be glad to work 
on it. I’m pretty much in favor of 
natural selection, myself. I mean, 
we’ve got improved cattle and 
high-yield hens and protein-rich 
grain, not to mention oceanculture; 
with the world birthrate finally 
within the food-and-energy curve, 
we don’t need to go artificial.” 

“We don’t?’’ Sharayde looked 
meaningfully at the deformed feet. 

Defiantly Taufry thrust out his 
surgical boots. “So we have a few 
accidents. It’s a small price.” 

“To pay for what?” 

“Serendipity, perhaps.” 

Taufry rose and smoothed his 
lilac skinsuit. “I’ll get this back to 
you.” 

★ * * 

The wallad blonde kept intruding 
on his roughs; in disgust, Ben threw 
down the block and took up his 
sketchpad. 

“That is without doubt the 
sexiest face I’ve ever seen,” Karlyn 
Livonna murmured in his ear. “Boy 
or girl?’’ Paul Savin’s personal 
secretary stood behind him, poised 



in her usual perfection of face and 
hair and dress. 

“Is that why you weren’t home 
last night? I tried to call you, Ben. 
Twice.” She stepped away, perched 
one silken hip on his console, like a 
restless bird before flight. 

When she’d approached him after 
the Alwark Open, he’d been dazed 
and flattered. Now he could only 
remember how she’d grown less 
and less approachable, how they’d 
failed to build anything meaningful 
between them. 

“I finally got my cooking 
license. I wanted you to have a real 
dinner.” 

Then, circling like a hawk, 
“Who is that, anyhow?” 

Ben stared down at his sketch- 
book. He’d drawn Lenny Two, nes- 
tled in the padded chair; the subtly 
exaggerated perspective emphasized 
the sudje-lost face, the helpless free 
hand curled palm up between the 
thighs. He’d meant to show the 
fierce, dangerous little bastard 
who’d ripped him, but that menace 
was from the Alwark streets. (And ~ 
good riddance, Ben told himself 
sternly.) 

“Boy or girl?” Karlyn repeated. 

If he explained, he’d have to con- 
fess his stupidity of last night. 

If he didn’t, he risked alienating 
a woman who was not only a com- 
passionate playmate, but a valuable 
asset; if he followed his instinctive 
resolve and left Savin, he might 
convince her to accompany him. 
With her help, he might even set up 

135 



THE WALLAD BLONDE 




in business for himself — as long as 
he remembered how easily their re- 
lationship could twist to her advan- 
tage. 

“You didn’t come down to ask 
who my models are,” he blurted, 
distracted by the soft curve of a leg 
sheathed in turquoise silk, the soft 
pads of her fingers upturned on his 
console in unconscious imitation of 
the hand in his sketch. 

“No, of course not. Paul wants 
you to lunch with him and the Only 
Yours rep, since he’s given you the 
account.” 

Ben gasped. Suddenly Karlyn 
was a distraction, keeping him from 
diving for the lav to check his shave 
and makeup, brush and spray his 
hair. Nothing he could do about the 
suit; why hadn’t Paul warned him 
yesterday? 

“What about tonight?” Karlyn 
pressed him. “1 even caught a bit 
of sudje, Ben. Just for us.” 

His s’mile felt glued to his face, 
like a poorly assembled collage. 
“I’ll call you, Karlyn,” he mum- 
bled. Then, viciously, “It was a 
boy.” 

Somewhere during lunch 
Sharayde’s half-formed decision to 
leave Savin AdArt evaporated. La- 
ter, curled pensively over his 
sketchblock, he couldn’t recall 
exactly what had changed his mind: 
being asked to plan the new cam- 
paign (Shebinoff wasn’t consulted, 
though he still held the local ac- 
count); the promised bonus; or the 
realization that he simply wasn’t the 

136 



businessman Paul Savin was, to 
maneuver people in Paul’s subtle 
yet persuasive manner. It was al- 
most as if he’d expected him to 
think of quitting. Thank god no one 
knew of the ripoff, or his plans; he 
had no embarrassing explanations to 
make. 

And he had no bright ideas for 
the dimenso. This time he was ex- 
pected to produce the entire pro- 
posal; the only thing he could think 
of was Sheb’s blonde. 

Replete from the excellent 
lunch — he’d eat like that every day, 
when the odd bonus became a fat 
salary — Ben slowly pulled out his 
sketchpads. Something there might 
give him an inspiration, though it 
was hard to guess what would sell 
the guided dream process in other 
cities, some of which disapproved 
of erotic stimulation during sleep, 
or any other time. 

The campaign would have to be 
subtle. 

Only Yours and EZSleep were 
subsidiaries of the same corpora- 
tion. Could he suggest an aid for 
insomniacs? Or emphasize the 
sleepno learning process? Some of 
the most puritanical areas were big 
on education. 

He certainly couldn’t ask Taufry 
for more advice. 

He had lots of good sketches, but 
nothing he could apply until he 
came up with the parameters of the 
campaign. The best was the one of 
the muscular black on the seawall, 
but he couldn’t see how to tie it in. 



GALAXY 




Maybe he was impatient to apply 
it, hoping to submit it for a prize. 

Maybe he wanted to use it be- 
cause it reflected his own erotic 
urges. But he’d just turned Karlyn 
down; he surely didn’t want a 
synthetic substitute! 

On his way home, he carefully 
notwatched the wall. When he ar- 
rived he learned that a bash had 
been announced on the floor above 
his apartment; with his painful 
hand, carelessly overused through- 
out the day, Ben decided not to at- 
tend, though for some reason it at- 
tracted him more than such affairs 
usually did. 

Cydra was booked for the eve- 
ning. 

Lenny’s sudjed, sensuous face 
came between himself and Karlyn. 

He turned from the fonescreen, 
and the promptcomp raised the vol- 
ume. A five-minute minidrama for 
Only Yours pranced through his 
room: the wallad blonde, arm-in- 
arm with a tall black girl, called in- 
vitingly to a shadowy person not yet 
onstage . 

Ben flashed a station change, 
hoping that Only Yours hadn’t 
bought saturation. They had. He cut 
off the holovee, telling himself that 
once he had the campaign under 
control the porno would no longer 
disturb him. 

He had trouble falling asleep. 

His unremembered dreams were 
unpleasantly frustrating. 

He woke angry with himself; why 
was he so suggestible? He needed a 



woman; more than that, he needed a 
sympathetic ear. If Cydra didn’t 
satisfy him, why should he imagine 
that a programmed dream would? 
Perhaps his rejection of Karlyn was 
symptomatic: he couldn’t stand her 
domination; offering him sudje sim- 
ply showed she controlled the rela- 
tionship. Maybe women had their 
own needs and interests, but he 
didn’t want to get involved in that. 

No wonder a sleepno seemed at- 
tractive. 

* * * 

The cornrowed black, mouth 
slightly open, eyes eager, was once 
again planted under the wallad as 
Sharayde passed. The sultry voice 
included him: “ONLY YOURS, 
lover. .dream with me to- 
night. .I’m Suzi, program 
63B. .ONLY YOURS, lover. .’’ 

Ben stopped. 

“Duck off!” the black growled. 
Muscles bunched in cheeks and 
biceps. “Stick to your own kind, 
heah?” 

Startled, Ben stepped back. A 
great hand jammed his shoulder 
bones together, lifting him almost 
off his feet. For a second he saw 
the wall as the taller man did: a 
statuesque black girl, full breasted, 
full hipped, fertile as a moongod- 
dess, the girl who walked with his 
blonde, turning to tease him. 

“Your pardon. Citizen. If you 
would look through my eyes a mo- 

137 



THE WALLAD BLONDE 




ment, you’d see this is a height- 
oriented display.” How calm he 
sounded! 

“Huh?” The man swung back, 
his fingers loosened a fraction, and 
Sharayde ducked away, shaking. 

He didn’t want to see the inside 
of a stationhouse again. 

Neither did he want to arrive at 
work obviously upset. 

He wanted to rent an Only 
Yours. He’d never tried the combi- 
nation of hypnosis and sensory 
stimulation that induced controlled 
dreaming; perhaps his lack of per- 
sonal experience was keeping him 
from creating the campaign. 

It wasn’t addictive, he reminded 
himself. The process gave only 
general guidance; each dreamer 
added elements from his own sub- 
conscious. He could dream a Suzi 
whose emotional needs would coin- 
cide with his. 

And he could charge the initial 
setup cost to Savin AdArt as re- 
search expense! 

Resolutely he bucked the crowd 
under the wallad. “ONLY 
YOURS,” she whispered. 

“Damn right,” he answered 
aloud. 

Early sleepno models had re- 
quired electrodes attached to neck 
and scalp; these now were incorpo- 
rated in a long-sleeved, high-necked 
sleepsuit which permitted unre- 
stricted movement while transmit- 
ting minute impulses to the 
peripheral nervous system when the 
REMs of dreaming sleep were 

138 



picked up by the projector mounted 
by the bed. 

Ben had expected to feel relaxed 
and confident after the hypno ses- 
sion, but he only succeeded in 
achieving a state of acute anxiety as 
he paced the floor in his sleepsuit, 
as instructed, to mold it to his 
body. Already he could hardly feel 
it, but it was hard to believe that 
the rest of the program would work 
as well. 

Even Suzi’s face seemed dim and 
distant. He could recall nothing of 
the introductory dream. Why hadn’t 
they removed his nervousness under 
hypnosis? They’d had him under 
long enough. Rental and set-up had 
taken the whole day. 

Now he was simply stalling, 
notwatching the holovee rather than 
committing himself to bed. 

The unit, warmed up and ready, 
emitted a slight, soporific hum. 

Ben’s hands shook as he pulled 
back the covers . 

★ * * 

Golden tanned, with the tang of 
seasalt on her skin, Suzi slipped 
into his arms. With slow rolling 
combers tickling their feet, she lis- 
tened, entranced, as Ben Sharayde 
spoke. 

Then they were in his studio, and 
he showed her drawings he had 
withheld Trom Savin as too self- 
revelatory. Empathically, she under- 
stood them. As they responded to 
each other, he vaguely remembered 

GALAXY 




that sleepsuit filaments were im- 
pinging on his nervous system, rout- 
ing preplanned feedback, then ig- 
nored it. Carried to peaks beyond 
previous experience, they achieved 
an intimacy he had never known. 

Half-waking, lazily anxious to 
keep remnants of the dream, he 
thought: what would our child be 
like, our natural child? 

Genetically unprogrammed, it 
wouldn’t be accepted by the 
Creche. He could sponsor it for 
training, but the chance that it 
would earn employment and citizen- 
ship would be slim. 

Every child deserved a perfect 
birthright. He thought grimly of 
Will Taufry, who must have been 
among the last of the naturally con- 
ceived. No child of his should suf- 
fer such deformity! 

The promptcomp chimed, build- 
ing a morning snapper. Time to get 
up; and now he knew how to handle 
the Only Yours campaign. 

Taufry waited for him in his 
studio, the thesis on his lap. Ben 
cut off his eager flow of explana- 
tion, while his stylo flew over the 
plastop. The layout grew in a spill 
of color. 

“There! Like it?” 

“Not bad. But you didn’t ask me 
to critique a porno. Where were you 
yesterday? Never mind. 

“This thesis is more than a tech- 
nical paper. It’s a congressional 
proposal; the author doesn’t care if 
the illos are appropriate, he just 
wants it noticed. Then he can come 



on strong in committee. 

“This is big, Ben. And scary. 
Remember the Crisis of ’38?” 

“Something to do with food, I 
think.” 

“You were still in Creche, I sup- 
pose. It was a world famine. Any 
idea what caused it?” 

Ben ran his fingers over the plas- 
top, impatient to transfer the sketch 
to permablock and add emoting. 
How could a thirty-year-past famine 
reflect the present? There hadn’t 
been one since; obviously, the cause 
had been corrected. He said as 
much, grunting. 

“Pay attention, Ben. It started 
with a triticale rust, a mutation of 
an old disease that wasn’t even sup- 
posed to affect the mutant hybrids. 
Then a mosaic started on potatoes, 
and something else took the corn 
crop. All at once. So we had a 
crisis. Because those diseases didn’t 
just affect a field or two, Ben. No, 
our agriculture has developed strains 
so high-yielding, so disease- 
resistant, so easy to weed and fer- 
tilize, that almost every farmer in 
the temperate latitudes plants the 
same seed. Anything that infects 
that strain simply gallops around the 
world. And then the experts have to 
breed resistant strains, and there’s 
the catch. None of the old, tough, 
low-yield stuff is still around. 
There’s no way of guessing how 
many varieties were permanently 
lost by our modem advertising and 
distributing system, not to mention 
the idiotic use of land for housing

before Contract complexes were 
built. 

“The rust was beyond chemical 
control. 1 know, my family are far- 
mers; I saw those fields. You just 
can’t imagine, mile after mile of 
drooping stalks, with the half-ripe 
heads in the dust, and the shining 
green-gold turning a miserable brick 
color. 

My oldest brother’s planting mu- 
tated seed in the same fields, now, 
mile after mile of triticale-173. And 
some day something’ll take out that 
strain, and they’ll have to start 
over . 

“Maybe I didn’t make it clear. 
They had to mutate by radiation, 
discarding about a million lethals in 
the process, because there wasn’t a 
naturally rust-resistant strain left. 
Triticale was an artifically forced 
hybrid, originally, you know; but 
even the parent strains were largely 
lost. So they developed a resistant 
strain; and found it too weak-stalked 
to harvest; and nothing to breed it 
back to, until they uncovered some 
grass — in Africa, 1 think — and 
forced another genetic match. And 
there was the same struggle with 
com and potatoes, while the world 
slowly starved.’’ Taufry heaved 
himself out of the chair and paced, 
his face haggard. 

Ben shook his head sympatheti- 
cally, his visually oriented imagina- 
tion a tangle of fallen grain and 
rusting farm machinery. “But 
what’s all that got to do with this 
thesis? I can’t understand much of 

140 



it, but it hasn’t a word about field 
crops.’’ ^ 

“True. I’m trying to give you the 
background. Help you understand 
what happens when the gene pool 
of any species is censored too dras- 
tically. 

“Ben, you have children.’’ 
Sharayde stared at the little man. 
“You know I do.’’ 

“And you assume that I don’t. 
Only healthy, registered Citizens 
can contribute heritance. Unregs 
have kids, who run the streets on 
their parents’ dole, but they’ll never 
be used as donors. And their prog- 
eny are allowed to starve.’’ 

“Well, there’s the quota . 

“Ah, the quota. That lets some 
of those children into school, if 
they’re sponsored, or otherwise 
qualify. If you should sire a careless 
child, Ben, you might even be 
moved to sponsor it yourself, pub- 
licity be damned.” 

(With Suzi, if there really was a 
Suzi. Tauf had a point.) 

“Do you see what I’m driving at, 
Ben?” 

Sharayde rubbed his forehead, 
where a gentle pulse promised the 
father and mother of a migraine to 
come. He poured some water and 
took a pill. If Taufry had something 
to say, why didn’t he come right 
out and say it? 

“Tauf, I’m not feeling well, and 
Savin’s looking for this layout. 
Suppose we discuss this again to- 
morrow?” 

Taufry tossed the envelope onto 
GALAXY 




his console and drew himself up 
like an offended billy goat. His 
crest of upended hair as tall as he 
could manage, he clopped out. 

Ben felt momentary guilt. He’d 
interrupted whatever Taufry’d been 
working on, and then hadn’t even 
listened to his results. But he had to 
complete the outline before his 
headache got beyond the point 
where medication would hold it. He 
took up the permablock and began 
to work. The day somehow 
passed . 

* * * 

A second pill made him drowsy; 
he fell into bed, hardly noticing the 
sleepsuit that now covered him like 
a second skin. 

They met under a blue-white sky; 
his headache vanished at the very 
sight of her sweetly curved body. 

She clung to him silently in a 
gently rippling ocean of ripening 
grain, and there was nothing he 
needed to say to her, nothing for 
her to explain to him; she opened 
herself and he plowed into her, try- 
ing to plant reality in her eager ac- 
ceptance, his eyes level with bro- 
ken, copper-smeared stalks. 

* it -k 

Savin was pleased with the lay- 
out, and sent it to a wordsmith for 
polishing. It would be days before 
Ben had to produce a finished plate; 
he took up the thesis, drawing angu- 



lar clumps of dying grain as he 
studied Taufry’s notes. 

Taufry spotted them at once. 

“You’ve got it!’’ he yelped. 
“Now put in some human skele- 
tons.’’ 

“This?” Ben gave it full atten- 
tion. “I was just doodling. .1 
dreamed about it last night, dam- 
mit.” 

“Good. You’ve got to scare hell 
out of them.” 

“Me? Scare who? Come off it, 
Tauf.” 

“You. Out of us. I’ve put it to- 
gether, Ben; limited genetic selec- 
tion, combined with the S-2 pro- 
cess.” 

“The what?” 

“The process that invalidates the 
DNA immune-response triggers to 
create universal donors. You know 
they can transplant any body part 
now, without subjecting the recip- 
ient to anti-rejection treatments. 
Don’t look so blank, Ben! You 
must know what I mean!” 

Ben, whose mind had suddenly 
flashed back to Lenny Two, nod- 
ded. “I’d meant to ask you, Tauf, 
why you never had your feet fixed, 
now that the donor bank is cost- 
effective.” 

“I was going to,” Will Taufry’s 
normally pale face turned slightly 
green, and his eyes glazed. “1 even 
went up and inquired about it. 

“But I made one mistake. I 
asked to see the donors.” A shud- 
der whipf)ed through his body. “A 
doctor took me down to a room full 

141 



THE WALLAD BLONDE 




of kids — S-2 works best on 
adolescents — in restraints, naked, 
drugged mindless — waiting like pa- 
tient animals to be carved up and 
pxjrtioned out for sale. Most of them 
were already missing bits here and 
there, an eye, a leg, hunks of mus- 
cle and skin, *and all of them were 
bald; hair transplants were very big 
that year. 

“I got sick on the spot. Embar- 
rassed the doctor terribly. He prob- 
ably bent the rules, taking me down 
at all, but he knew 1 was in adver- 
tising, he was very p.r. con- 
scious. .well, of course I couldn’t 
go through with it. God knows what 
I’ll do if I ever need a donation; 
I’m not sure I could accept one now 
even to save my life.” 

“That’s silly. You said yourself 
they were mindless.” 

“1 know. The child whose feet I 
was buying was already destroyed. 
But I saw them, Ben.” 

“The City is better off without 
them. I ran into one — he ripped me 
off — nasty, vicious little bastard! — I 
was glad when I saw him sudjed 
and ready for processing. For once 
he was an asset, not a liability.” 
“He was nasty, dirty, and vicious 
because he didn’t have a chance to 
be anything else. He must have 
been clever or he’d never have 
caught you. Don’t you see that as a 
waste?” 

‘Wo!” But Ben swallowed 
sickly, trying not to visualize Lenny 
Two in fragments. 

“What we’re doing is fishing the 

142 



gene pool from both ends,” Taufry 
continued relentlessly. “Genetic 
selection on the one hand, and re- 
moval of unplanned, possibly 
serendipitous genes among the un- 
registered. 

“Naturally there’s a big demand 
for S-2 donors; someday they may 
take kids right out of the Creche, if 
they’re slightly unsatisfactory. 
Transplants earn Alwark a lot of 
money, and it’s humanitarian, be- 
sides. And there’s no protection for 
the kids. 

“Oh, we’re pragmatists. Better to 
save a productive Citizen than some 
unknown quantity, like a child. But 
someday we’ll limit our selection 
just a little too much by putting a 
dollars-and-cents value on the gene 
pool.” 

“You’re expecting a people rot, 
Tauf?” Ben tried to laugh. 

“Why not?” 

“God, what a pessimist!” 

“I’m not the only one.” Taufry 
tapped the thesis significantly. 

“We don’t need the unregs,” 
Ben argued. “We can always swap 
a few vials of semen somewhere, 
spread the old genes around.” 

“We already have;- man’s a 
traveler, and he’s left souvenirs 
wherever he goes. The rest of the 
world is imitating our success, here. 
Oh, it won’t happen tomorrow. We 
haven’t the faintest idea when or 
whether we eliminate a trait we will 
need someday; we don’t even know 
what the trait is. Maybe there’s 
something linked to defective feet 

GALAXY 




that could save the world, some 
day. Maybe something goes with 
albinism, or schizophrenia. 

“This proposes legal protection 
for all minors, and removal of the 
stigma on natural birth.’’ 

“That would practically wipe out 
the donor program. Surely there’s 
no need to go that far!” 

“It would at least maKe it un- 
economical,” Taufry agreed. 

“But there’s billions of people, 
uncounted combinations of 
genes ...” 

“That’s true. But there was lots 
of grass, too; it just happened to all 
be the wrong type.” 

“Geneticists plan for all this. 
They have to.” 

“If they consider it at all, how 
can they extrapolate unknown 
needs?” 

“Analog computers ...” 

“Can only run what’s fed into 
them.” 

Ben sighed. “Suppose you con- 
vince me. What can I do?” 

“Beside illustrate this the best 
you can? Durino, Ben. But the chap 
who sent it here is right. If he’s 
going to attract attention, he’s got 
to start with advertising. With us.” 
“That’s too much!” 

“Too much responsibility? 
Maybe so. Every once in a while 
something like this comes along, 
something quiet and frightening, 
with a choice attached. If I hadn’t 
seen it, you’d never have known 
what you were working on. And no 
one will ever know if you duck the 

THE WALLAD BLONDE 



responsibility, either. But if you can 
get that feeling,” he gestured to- 
wards the dying stalks in Ben’s 
sketch, “in your illustration, you 
may just possibly save the fu- 
ture. .if you want to.” 

“Why did it come to me?” Ben 
groaned. “Anyhow,” he went on 
more calmly, “how do I know you 
know what you’re talking about? 
You’ve got a twist on genetics, 
stands to reason. You’re probably 
blowing this out of all proportion.” 
“Wouldn’t it be nice if I were?” 
By the end of the day, Ben had 
sketches that would fittingly illus- 
trate Dante’s Inferno, but none of 
them would dent the conditioned 
consciousness of his world like the 
quiet desperation implicit in the 
dead grain. 

It didn’t make sense, anyhow. 
Nothing could be that simple. It 
didn’t stand to reason that a single 
concept really stood with its finger 
in the dyke that way. 

But he didn’t want to dream that 
night, not after the grainfield; he 
didn’t want to meet her there, or in 
an operating room where children 
were sectioned into living prosthe- 
tics, or a laboratory where gene 
selectors chose the future of the 
human race . 

★ ★ ★ 

He fell asleep in his chair as the 
promptcomp softly spun commer- 
cials through his livingspace. 

He dreamed he was explaining 
the illustrated thesis to Savin, 

143 




fidgeting as he hadn’t done in 
years. “1 don’t understand why 
you’ve used so much emotion,” 
Savin shook his leonine head 
mildly. A mild Savin was danger- 
ous. 

‘‘This is serious, Paul.” Better 
not admit that Taufry had done his 
thinking for him. ‘‘I’m really con- 
vinced of that.” (Am I: Am I real- 
ly?) 

‘‘Look at it this way,” Savin re- 
plied smoothly, tossing blonde locks 
as he reached for a stylo. “The kids 
are better off as donors than dying 
in the streets; they’re fed and 
housed and cared for.” 

“Just like animals.” 

“Useful animals. You sound like 
a radical idealist, Ben. Suppose you 
got wiped in a street fight, or de- 
veloped cancer. You’re a valuable 
Citizen; would you trade your future 
for some bastard raiding garbage 
pickups?” Suddenly it was Suzi 
staring at him from Savin’s chair. 

Ben shifted uncomfortably. “I’d 
want to be cured, of course. But it 
isn’t right ...” « 

“How about me, Ben? Or our 
child?” 

“What if he was donated, in- 
stead?” Ben’s gut tightened pain- 
fully. The child he had vaguely im- 
agined now seemed very real and 
dear. 

“He wouldn’t be. Ben, you’re 
fighting progress. Why, with the 
donor program, a valuable man like 
you could live almost forever.” 
Suzi rose and came round the con- 



sole to lay a burning hand on his 
chest. 

Ben looked down at himself: a 
cobbled, patched old corpus split 
from collarbone to crotch, stuffed 
with assorted organs, all tagged 
with the donors’ names. Suzi’s hand 
held a pulsing young heart; Ben 
knew it came from Lenny Two. He 
slapped at the wound, too late; the 
heart was already his . 

“You’ve invaded me!” 

“Ah, Ben, I’m one with you.” 
He could no longer see her; she had 
faded into the flickering holoimage. 
Some dream this was! He should 
get his money back! But — 

“Hey! I’m not sleepno’d!” he 
shouted, lunging forward, falling 
stiff and chilled from his chair. 

The promptcomp, sensing his 
awakening, built a too-familiar 
commercial, line by dimensioned 
line. 

“Cut!” he screamed. It blinked 
off. 

Huddled on the floor, Sharayde 
wept. 

it * 1r 

Ben slumped at his console, 
nibbling the end of his stylo. The 
triticale, viciously stylized, was 
transferred to permablock. Against a 
snowy background the only colors 
slashed rust and black, the only 
emotion despair. If he released it 
with the thesis, people would re- 
member the famine of ’38; a 
crooked stem, a structured clod of

GALAXY 




earth, twined the numbers through 
the design. 

Did he really want the thesis to 
attract this much attention? Without 
flattering himself, Ben knew that 
the art was extraordinarily good. 
He’d come too far to compromise; 
either he used this, or refused the 
commission entirely. 

Never before had he come to the 
point where he had to say, here is 
my work, take it or leave it; adver- 
tising is not kind to inflexible in- 
tegrities. 

The Famine of ’38 formed the 
cover. The interior format was sim- 
ple, compensating for the complex 
text: a child graced the margin of 
each page, hopeful expectation 
suggested in plain outline. On the 
endpaper a blue-green globe, cloud- 
covered and serene, too distant to 
prove the presence of man, floated 
in a paperwhite forever. 

The morals involved were too 
complex to resolve, but he’d 
worked too hard, given too much of 
himself, to waste the illos. 

Ben racked up the finished thesis 
and chuted it to Savin’s office, then 
drew out his next assignment: tinted 
corneal lenses with fluorescent 
seductionlines shimmering across 
them. Probably bad for the vision, 
he thought, but merchandisable. He 
could finish it quickly, and stop by 
Only Yours for a new dream; he 
had to get 63B out of his mind. 

Reversing the gnawed stylo, he 
began to sketch Cydra, totally taka- 
ble, with wide fluorescent eyes. ★

This is alter-ego speaking. Jim 
Baen has just called and asked to 
have me and Geis write another 
column. 

Geis went into a blue funk and 
has refused to have anything to do 
with it. Correctly, he realizes that 
when the previous column is pub- 
lished this Fall and you readers vote 
on who is to be primary in this 
column — me or Geis — he will lose. 

“1 will not lose. Alter! 1 am not 
in a blue funk. God, how you lie 
and misrepresent! 1 merely went up- 
stairs to make a phone call and 
come back to find you starting this 
column without me. I shudder to 
think what would have happened if 
I’d called my friend, Jim Rise — ” 

He’s the guy who can talk the 
trunk off an elephant, isn’t he? 

146 



“Well, Jim does find an hour to 
be a trifle short as far as a conversa- 
tion goes, but — ’’ 

Call him, Geis. Let me alone to 
do the work around here. Go soak 
in a hot tub. Go out and putter in 
your garden. Pull a few thousand 
weeds. Talk to the strawberries. 
Murmur sweet nothings to the com 
stalks. Mutter dire threats to the 
peach tree that failed to bear this 
year. 

“1 will sit here and watch what 
you type with my fingers. Alter. 1 
will keep a mental finger on the 
override buttons and a hand near the 
blue pencil.” 

Killjoy! 

“Yes. Admitted. Now, let’s see 
you attend to something Jim 
wanted, namely explain how come 



GALAXY 



your predictions in the May issue 
have gone sour.” 

Sour? Sour? The only predictions 
I made that haven’t come true are 
the first ones — the political ones, 
and they were made way back in 
February, 1976, before the 
primaries had even begun. 

‘‘Alter, you predicted, and I 
quote: ‘1976: Ford loses to Reagan 
in nomination battle. Wallace health 
becomes a factor. Jimmy Carter be- 
neficiary of big media buildup to 
challenge Wallace. Ted Kennedy 
accepts nomination, beats Reagan. 
Inflation hits 12 — 15% in later 
months of 1976. Unemployment till 
8% plus.’ Care to explain how you 
missed on Carter/Kennedy?” 

First, Geis, let me make it clear 
to the readers that at the moment 
Reagan and Ford are neck and neck; 
Reagan could still unseat Ford. 
[Perhaps Alter will explain that next 
time. Ed.] 

George Wallace’s health did be- 
come a factor in his campaign; the 
stories of his paralysis and wheel 
chair life that kept appearing on TV 
doomed him. The voters saw him as 
not physically fit to be president. 

That helped sink Wallace, and 
the Stop-Wallace urgency by the 
leaders of the Democratic party also 
caused them to pass the Word to 
boost Jimmy Carter. 

Jimmy Carter knew the big liberal 
Demos would want a good, safe 
Southerner to use against the evil 
Wallace. He presented himself and 
got their support. Only thing is, he

has charisma and cunning and a 
keen nose for the wind of public 
disenchantment, and he quickly got 
himself a ton of publicity and a big 
bagfull of delegates before the 
king-makers and power-brokers 
knew what had hit them. You saw 
what happened; they turned desper- 
ately to Humphrey, Church, and fi- 
nally Brown to try to stop this grin- 
ning monster they had created — too 
late. They were trying to get Ken- 
nedy at the last minute, too, 
but . 

I still think the plan was for a 
deadlocked convention to turn to 
Kennedy. But Carter ran with that 
anti-establishment reformer theme 
and the people bought it. So now 
the Demo leaders must live with 
Carter, grumpily on the inside, and 
with sweetness and unity on the 
outside. We’re in for a succession 
of ‘maverick’ presidents, I think. 

‘‘You squirm pretty good. Alter, 
but you were still wrong.” 

Not by much, Geis, and I could 



147 



still be right about Reagan. And I’ll 
betcha I’m not far wrong on my 
12-15% inflation rate by year’s 
end, with unemployment around 
8%. 

“Fat chance — let’s drop it for 
now. Let’s turn to — ’’ 

Geis, I haVe a grotch I want to 
ungrotch. I want to — 

“Don’t be obscene, Alter, We 
can’t — ’’ 

For your low level of perception, 
Geis, I will speak in ultra-square 
words: I have a complaint. 

“Another complaint? That’s all I 
hear from now; the food is too 
ripe — ’’ 

‘Rotten’ is the word. 

“The dungeon is too cool — ’’ 

Cold, damp, moldy and drippy. 

“Or the lighting is less than 
ideal.” 

One naked forty watt bulb is not 
even sufferable. But my complaint 
this time is about an aspect of sci- 
ence fiction that bugs me, and that 
is slowly driving me up the slippery 
stone walls. 

*Sigh* “Another diatribe. What 
is it this time?” 

I am tired unto vomiting-up-my- 
swill of the old formula-based, 
pulp-bom, laziness-continued habit 
of science fiction writers that impels 
them to lean on the old mle of fic- 
tion writing that goes something 
like this: Up the Stakes. 

“I’m afraid. Alter ...” 

Don’t you understand? The 
surest, simplest, easiest way to 
make sure readers are hooked and 

148 



stay hooked into an sf story, espe- 
cially a novel, is to up the stakes — 
so that the fate of all Mankind or 
the planet or the solar system, or 
the galaxy or even the whole damn 
universe is at stake when the hero 
fights the baddies. 

“Well, sure . that’s tradi- 
tional.” 

That’s goat guano, Geis. It’s al- 
most always a signal the author is 
incompetent, feels himself to be a 
weak writer, or is too lazy to strug- 
gle through to a level of plotting 
and characterization where such pit- 
iful narrative crutches aren’t neces- 
sary. 

“Now, Alter, you paint with too 
wide a brush. Are you saying such 
writers as Larry Niven, Roger 
Zelazny, to name but a few good 
ones, are bad writers?” 

No, they’re good writers, but 
they’re trapped in bad habits left 
over from the pulp days. With them 
the End of the World/Race/ 
Galaxy/Universe formula is gilding 
the lily. They . .and a dozen or so 
other really good-to-excellent sf and 
fantasy writers . don’t need to 
rely on the old high stakes gimmick 
to hold their readers and tell a 
good, memorable story. But over 
and over, year after year, they all 
seem to construct stories that in- 
volve the Ultimate Doom un- 
less . 

“But, Alter, the readers like high 
stakes sf. Why not give them what 
they like?” 

They like good, well-told, tightly 
GALAXY 




structured, suspenseful stories. And 
all I’m saying is that this Ultimate 
Threat device of sf story-telling is 
runiling on its rims. It has been 
used to death. 

“But—” 

But nothing. Look at the other 
genres. Look at Westerns. When 
the hero blasts the hired gun the 
fate of all civilization doesn’t de- 
pend on that fast draw. All that’s at 
stake is one life, maybe a mortgage, 
and the love of his girl and his 
horse. 

“His horse!” 

Dog? Never mind. Look at the 
Gothics. All that’s on the line is a 
lady’s honor and maybe her life, 
which ever comes first. Also some 
love, I guess. Nothing cataclysmic. 

“Alter, I have spotted a chink in 
your armor.” j 

Nonsense, Geis. Nobody would 
believe a Chinese with spots. Now, 
take mysteries and detectives; do 
they require that the life and death 
of whole peoples, species and galac- 
tic cultures hang in the balance 
when the evil person who-dun-it is 
in the final face-down with the 
forces of Good? NO! 

“Alter, are you saying that all 
these other genres of fiction are bet- 
ter plotted and better characterized 
than Science Fiction stories and 
characters?” 

Oh. The chink? 

“The chink. I have thrust my 
verbal sword into your vitals.” 

Hmm. No, I don’t claim that at 
all. All I said was that it is too easy 

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



to rely on the old reliable sf most- 
dieadful-is-better gestalt to buttress 
a story’s interest potential. Plus 
there is that aspect called Sense of 
Wonder, and the other easy-way-out 
(to success and riches) of escalating 
a locale or a machine or a space 
ship to gigantic size -to impress and 
awe the reader. It may be part of 
the American Character at work, in 
that sense. The appeal is there. 
Using these guidelines, the ultimate 
sf novel would be about a 3000 foot 
alien frozen in a thousand mile long 
derelict spaceship which has been 
trapped in a galaxy-sized space- 
warp for six billion years, and if the 
hero doesn’t unwarp the warp and 
fix the spaceship and wake the alien 
within six days and thirty-three and 
a half minutes, the ENTIRE UNI- 
VERSE will go nova and kill off 
God. 

“Alter, you’re a genius! Let me 
take some notes. What would be a 
catchy title?” 

Geis! Damnit! I was mocking, 
exaggerating, satirizing to prove my 
point. 

“I know, but it’s a good plot! 
Give me a title. I’ll hack out an out- 
line, a chapter or two, and I’ll be 
rich!” 

How about THE GOOGOLPLEX 
MAN? 

“Yeeees ... I like it!” 

I hate it. No, I don’t hate it. I’d 
like it, but I’d hate myself in the 
morning for liking it, if somebody 
with talent wrote it. Not you, Geis. 

149 




You see, Geis, it can be done. 
Fascinating, gripping science fiction 
can be written in a narrow focus, 
small scale and low budget, so to 
speak. 

“But science fiction readers have 
been spoiled; we’ve grown accus- 
tomed to the'pace. We need our 
high-stakes novels. Look at the 
computers that take over the world, 
the disease that will wipe out all 
people, the natural disaster that 
threatens extinction to all man- 
kind . That’s heady stuff. It’s 
like a drug . and we require 
ever-greater disasters, ever huger 
spaces and deeds and effects to get 
our rockets off.” 

Exactly, Geis. You make my 
point. I say we’ve about reached the 
end of the road, the well is dry and 
the bottom of the High Stakes and 
Wonders barrel is staring us in the 
face. 

“You do coin a phrase. Alter. 
And I guess I’ll have to agree. It is 
time we sf writers consciously con- 
sidered giving up the over-reliance 
on the Big Scene and spent more 
time and effort on more believable 
future problems handled by more 
believable future people.” 

Sure. Look at TV. “The Wal- 
tons” don’t have to solve murders 
or perform brain surgery every 
week to maintain viewer interest. 
They give us sympathetic people 
struggling with personal and family 
problems during hard times. Top- 
rated show. Very good characteriza- 
tion and acting, and writing.

“Wow, Alter. You really think a 
future-fiction novel like that would 
have a chance . would get pub- 
lished?” 

It better. A lot of sf readers are 
getting awfnlly sick and tired of the 
diet of unending to-the-limit stuff 
they’ve been fed for 50 years. 
That’s partly why most sf readers 
give up on the genre after an early 
enthusiasm when young — they get 
unconsciously bored. Jaded. Give 
them real future people with real fu- 
ture problems on a believable scale, 
and they’d stick with us for a long 
time. 

“Maybe you’re right. Alter. But 
that 3000 foot alien in that thousand 
mile long derelict spaceship in-

Bah, you’re hopeless! Get out of

“What are you going to do —

Of the many kinds of tyranny, perhaps 

the most cruel is that of the majority. „ „ j 



Douglas bent jr. sits in his 
kitchen, waiting for his tea to heat. 
It is May 12, his birthday, and he 
has prepared wintergreen tea. Doug- 
las allows himself this extravagance 
because he knows he will receive 
no birthday present from anyone but 
himself. By'a trick of Time and 
timing, he has outlived all his 
friends, all his relatives. The con- 
cept of neighborliness, too, has pre- 
deceased him; not because he has 
none, but because he has too many. 

His may be, for all he kriows, the 
last small farm in Nova Scotia, and 
it is bordered on three sides by vast 
mined-out clay pits, gaping concen- 
tric cavities whose inside were 
scraped out and eaten long ago, 
their husk thrown away to rot. On 
the remaining perimeter is an 
apartment-hive, packed with ant-like 
swarms of people. Douglas knows 
none of them as individuals; at 
times, he doubts the trick is possi- 
ble. 

Once Douglas’s family owned 
hundreds of acres along what was 
then called simply The Shore Road; 
once the Bent spread ran from the 
Bay of Fundy itself back over the 
peak of the great North Mountain, 
included a sawmill, rushing 
streams, hundreds of thousands of 
trees, and acre after acre of pasture 
and hay and rich farmland; once the 
Bents were one of the best-known 
families from Annapolis Royal to 
Bridgetown, their livestock the envy 
of the entire Annapolis Valley. 

Then the petrochemical industry 

152 



died of thirst. With it, of course, 
went the plastics industry. Clay 
suddenly became an essential 
substitute — and the Annapolis Val- 
ley is mostly clay. 

Now the Shore Road is the Fundy 
Trail, six lanes of high-speed traf- 
fic; the Bent spread is fourteen 
acres on the most inaccessible part 
of the Mountain; the sawmill has 
been replaced by the industrial park 
that ate the clay; the pasture and the 
streams and the farmland have been 
disemboweled or paved over; all the 
Bents save Douglas Jr. are dead or 
moved to the cities; and no one now 
living in the Valley has ever seen a 
live cow, pig, duck, goat or chick- 
en, let alone envied them. Agribus- 
iness has destroyed agriculture, and 
synthoprotein feeds (some of) the 
world. Douglas grows only what 
crops replenish themselves, feeds 
only himself. 

He sits waiting for the water to 
boil, curses for the millionth time 
the solar-powered electric stove that 
supplanted the family’s woodbumer 
when firewood became impossible 
to obtain. Electric stoves take too 
long to heat, call for no tending, 
perform their task with impersonal 
callousness. They do not warm a 
room.

Douglas’s gnarled fingers idly 
sort through the wintergreen he 
picked this morning, spurn the jar 
of sugar that stands nearby. All his 

GALAXY 




life, Douglas has made wintergreen 
tea from fresh maple sap, which re- 
quires no sweetening. But this 
spring he journeyed with drill and 
hammer and tap and bucket to his 
only remaining maple tree, and 
found it dead. He has bought 
maple-flavored sugar for this birth- 
day tea, but he knows it will not be 
the same. Then again, next spring 
he may find no wintergreen. 

So many old familiar friends have 
failed to reappear in their season 
lately — the deer moss has gone 
wherever the hell the deer went to, 
crows no longer raid the compost 
heap, even the lupens have de- 
creased in number and in brilliance. 
The soil, perhaps made self- 
conscious by its conspicuous isola- 
tion, no longer bursts with life. 

Douglas realizes that his own sap 
no longer runs in the spring, that 
the walls of his house ring with no 
voice save his own. If a farm sur- 
rounded by wasteland cannot sur- 
vive, how then shall a man? It fs 
my birthday, he thinks, how old am 
I today 7 

He cannot remember. 

He looks up at the goddamelec- 
tricclock (the family’s two- 
hundred-year-old cuckoo clock, 
being wood, did not survive the 
Panic Winter of ’94), reads the date 
from its face (there are no longer 
trees to spare for fripperies like 
paper calendars), sits back with a 
grunt. 2049, like I thought, but 
when was / born? 

So many things have changed in 



Douglas’s lifetime, so many of 
Life’s familiar immutable aspects 
gone forever. The Danielses to the 
east died childless: their land now 
holds a sewage treatment plant. On 
the west the creeping border of An- 
napolis Royal has eaten the land up, 
excreting concrete and steel and far 
too many people as it went. An- 
napolis is now as choked as New 
York City was in Douglas’s father’s 
day. feconomic helplessness has 
driven Douglas back up the North 
Mountain, step by inexorable step, 
and the profits (he winces at the 
word) that he reaped from selling 
off his land parcel by parcel (as, in 
his youth, he bought it from his an- 
cestors) have been eaten away by 
the rising cost of living. Here, on 
his last fourteen acres, in the two- 
story house he built with his own 
hands and by Jesus wood, Douglas 
Bent Jr. has made his last stand. 

* * * 

He questions his body as his 
father taught him to do, is told in 
reply that he has at least ten or 
twenty more years of life left. How 
old am /? he wonders again, forty- 
five? Fifty? More? He has simply 
lost track, for the years do not mean 
what they did. It matters little; 
though he may have vitality for 
twenty years more, he has money 
for no more than five. Less, if the 
new tax laws penalizing old age are 
pushed through in Halifax. 

The water has begun to boil. 

153 



NO RENEWAL 




Douglas places wintergreen and 
sugar in the earthenware mug his 
mother made (back when clay was 
dug out of the backyard with a 
shovel), removes the pot from the 
stove, and pours. His nostrils test 
the aroma; to his dismay, the fake 
smells genuine. Sighing from his 
belly, he moves to the rocking chair 
by the kitchen window, places the 
mug on the sill, and sits down to 
watch another sunset. From here 
Douglas can see the Bay, when the 
wind is right and the smoke from 
the industrial park does not come 
between. Even then, he can no 
longer see the far shores of New 
Brunswick, for the air is thicker 
than when Douglas was a child. 

The goddamclock hums, the 
mug steams. The winds are from 
the north — a cold night is coming, 
and tomorrow may be one of the 
improbable “Bay-steamer” days 
with which Nova Scotia salts its 
rnring. It does not matter to Doug- 
las; his solar heating is far too effi- 
cient. His gaze wanders down the 
access road which leads to the 
highway; it curves downhill and left 
and disappears behind the birch and 
alders and pine that line it for a 
half-mile from the house. If Doug- 
las looks at the road right, he can 
sometimes convince himself that 
around the bend are not strip-mining 
shells and brick apartment-hives but 
arable land, waving grain, and the 
world he once knew. Fields and yal- 
ler dogs and grazing goats and 
spring mud and tractors and bams 

154 



and goat-berries like stockpiles of 
B-B shot . 

* ★ * 

Douglas’s mind wanders a lot 
these days. It has been a long time 
since he enjoyed thinking, and so 
he had lost the habit. It has been a 
long time since he had anyone with 
whom to share his thoughts, and so 
he has lost the inclination. It has 
been a long time since he under- 
stood the world well enough to 
think about it, and so he has lost 
the ability. 

Douglas sits and rocks and sips 
his tea, spilling it down the front of 
his beard and failing to notice. How 
old am I? he thinks for the third 
time, and summons enough will to 
try and find out. Rising from the 
rocker with an effort, he walks on 
weary wiry legs to the living room, 
climbs the stairs to the attic, paus- 
ing halfway to rest. 

My father was sixty-one he re- 
calls as he sits, wheezing, when he 
accepted euthanasia. Surely I am not 
that old. What keeps me alive? 

He has no answer. 

When he reaches the attic, Doug- 
las spends fifteen minutes in locat- 
ing the ancient trunk in which Bent 
family records are kept. They are 
minutes well-spent: Douglas is 
cheered by many of the antiques he 
must shift to get at the trunk. Here 
is the potter’s wheel his mother 
worked; there the head of the axe 

GALAXY 




with which he once took off his 
right big toe; over in the comer a 
battered peavey from the long-gone 
sawmill days. They remind him of a 
childhood when life still made 
sense, and bring a smile to his griz- 
zled features. It does not stay long. 

Opening the trunk presents 
difficulties — it is locked, and Doug- 
las cannot remember where he put 
the key. He has not seen it for 
many years, or the trunk for that 
matter. Finally he gives up, 
smashes the old lock with the 
peavey, and levers up the lid (the 
Bents have always learned leverage 
as they got old, working efficiently 
long after strength has gone). It 
opens with a shriek, hinges protest- 
ing their shattered sleep. 

* * * 

The past leaps out at him like the 
woes of the world from Pandora’s 
Box. On top of the pile is a picture 
of Douglas’s parents, Douglas Sr. 
and Sarah, smiling on their wedding 
day. Grandfather Lester behind 
them near an enormous bam, graz- 
ing cattle visible in the background. 

Beneath the picture he finds a 
collection of receipts for paid 
grain-bills, remembers the days 
when food was cheap enough to 
feed animals, and there were ani- 
mals to be fed. Digging deeper, he 
comes across canceled checks, in- 
surance policies, tax records, a col- 
lection of report cards and letters 



wrapped in ribbon. Douglas pulls 
up short at the hand-made rosary he 
gave his mother for her fifteenth 
anniversary, and wonders if either 
of them still believed in God even 
then. Again, it is hard to remember. 

At last he locates his birth 
certificate. He stands, groaning with 
the ache in his calves and knees, 
and threads his way through the 
crowded attic to the west window, 
where the light from the setting sun 
is sufficient to read the fading 
document. He seats himself on the 
shell of a television that has not 
worked since he was a boy, holds 
the paper close to his face and 
squints. 

“May 12, 1989,’’ reads the 
date at the top. 

Why, I'm fifty years old he 
tells himself in wonderment. Fifty; 
I’ll be damned. 

There is something about, the 
number that rings a bell in Doug- 
las’s tired old mind, something he 
can’t quite recall about what it 
means to be fifty years old. He 
squints at the birth certificate again. 

And there on the last line, he 
sees it, sees what he had almost 
forgotten, and realizes that he was 
wrong — he will be getting a birth- 
day present today after all. 

For the bottom line of his birth- 
certificate says, simply and bles- 
sedly, ”... expiry date; May 12, 
2049.” 

Downstairs, for the first time in 
years, there is a knock at the 
door. ★

DIRECTIONS 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Two stories in the September 1976 issue 
deserve comment. “Abandon all Heat — ” (to 
use the short title) is not only a gem, but 
clearly, without saying so, it reveals the se- 
cret of entropy itself. Not just the introduction 
of disorder, that was stated, but the energy- 
loss at each transaction (described as a gate 
in a black box). Hell is the other half of the 
box, and a toll of energy from each transac- 
tion in our universe is directed through to 
keep Hell hot. 

I should have known, being one of the 
small group of anthropologists who describe 
social power and organizational relationships 
in terms of relative entropy and energy-flow. 

Which brings me to Nocka Nocka in “The 
Dirty Old Man.” While anthropologists such 
as those depicted there (the chances are 
overwhelming that a linguist knowing any 
Calusa would be an anthropological linguist) 
are not unknown (in fact Tarantella is very 
reminiscent of one of the legendary pioneer 
ethnologists), the percentage has always been 
low and in this generation is almost zero. All 
I've got to say is that Nocka Nocka is just 
lucky they weren't archaeologists. He'd have 
starved. 

As to Vine De Loria, he is an an- 
thropologist himself. He is very highly re- 
garded in the profession for the excellent 
work he does, and he talks rough to the 
kinds of anthropologists who sin by his stan- 

156 



dards, not because he hates anthropologists, 
but because he's trying to educate them all to 
his standards. I have not discussed this with 
him, but to another Lakota anthropologist 
who was berating anthropologists collec- 
tively, 1 asked, “If you feel that way, why 
are you an anthropologist?" 

“Because,” she said, “1 want to be an an- 
thropologist more than anything else in the 
world.” 

Most of us feel that way.

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I have a question to pose which 1 think 
science fiction readers (and authors) might 
find interesting and worth discussing. My 
question is this: What skills, training, attri- 
butes, aptitudes, etc., will be required of a 
member of the first lunar colony? 

I'm a senior in high school, and I, along 
with several friends, have been wondering 
whether I have the interests and capabilities 
required. My friends (other high school stu- 
dents) and I have talked about many aspects 
of this already, such as what would be the 
best age, and whether a military background 
is necessary. 

I've been enjoying Galaxy’s increasingly 
better stories, and Dr. Poumelle's column is 
always worth the price of an issue by itself.

Good question. Clearly, however, the 
answer will depend on the nature of the col- 
ony (or colonies) in question. For example, a 
pure-research oriented establishment would 
require a very different skills mix than would 
a manufacturing complex than would a con- 
struction site devoted to hoisting up mass to 
the Lagrangian Points than would a military 
base. Perhaps your best bet would be to 
familiarize yourself with SASA's require- 
ments for payload specialists as a first step. 
And don't miss the March '77 issue of 

GALAXY 



Galaxy; Dr. Pournelle is going to answer 
your question at length! 

Dear Sir 

From all indications, the most significant 
aspect of Galaxy (apart from exemplary edit- 
ing) is Jerry Poumelle's column. By Crom. 
this fellow has a way of inspiring both 
strangely tangential thoughts and bladder 
bursting fear. 

“Lasers, Grasets, and Marxists” did both. 
After changing underwear, I did some think- 
ing about our present American-Soviet posi- 
tion. If they've got any logic to them at all, 
the Soviets have no intention of obliterating 
the United States. For all our faults and 
many shortcomings, dear old Uncle Sam still 
has an economy and an agricultural technol- 
ogy that is bolstering the entire world. Sim- 
ply put, the Soviets would starve. 

Of course, this all depends on the mainte- 
nance of our present state of free enterprise 
and developing, within the next generation, 
an alternate energy source. 

Sincerely yours, 
Gary L. Day 

Dear James; 

In the view of some physicists today, the 
basic philosophy or current popular interpre- 
tation of special relativity leads to absurd and 
self-contradictory consequences and therefore 
to an illusionary physics. This is becoming 
clearer every day as physicists invent 
theories of black holes, claiming that they 
are gateways to seemingly occult dimen- 
sions, teleportation, time travel, and God 
knows what. Ironically, these are the ulti- 
mate consequences of the relativity 
philosophy; either we believe them as literal 
realities, or question the philosophical basis 
of special relativity by asking whether we 
have been mislead to illusion by illusion. 

Probably the most physically unrealistic 
and self-contradictory concept in special re- 
lativity is the increase in rest mass m with 
velocity. Relativity philosophy interprets this 
increase literally rather than apparently or il- 
lusionary. Relativistic mass m' — ► » has 
been confirmed for bodies accelerated by 



systems at rest S (the increase in m deriving 
from the energy of accelerating fields at rest 
with S); it is nor logically confirmed when 
the means of acceleration moves with the 
system in motion S', as with space ships. If 
the two cases are physically equivalent, 
whcie does the increase in m come from in 
the latter case, as viewed by S??? That is, 
bow, witlioin violMing energy-mass conser- 
vation, can m' become 2m. 3m . ? Shall 
we claim, implicitly as relativity does, that 
the body in S' creates its own mass, or admit 
self-contradiction? 

If S' considers himself at rest, justified by 
the principle of relativity, and S (at rest rela- 
tive to the universe) to be in motion. S' OB- 
SERVES THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. AND 
EVERY STAR SEPARATED BY MILL- 
IONS OF LIGHT "YEARS, TO LITERALLY 
and immediately INCREASE IN 
MASS; EVEN DESPITE THAT IT IS NOT 
THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE WHICH IS 
BEING OBSERVED, BUT ITS IMAGE AS 
IT EXISTED MILLIONS OF YEARS 
AGO!!! Relativity confuses images and ob- 
servations of a thing with the physical thing 
itself. 

Because S and S' are not physically con- 
nected, except for receiving light images of 
each other, it is observations of images that 
are made, not measurements detecting physi- 
cal changes were S and S' physically con- 
nected, as in the case of S' accelerated by a 
rest system. 

No natural particle or body has been found 
to exceed light velocity because they were 
accelerated by rest systems; and even if they 
could we would not detect them because no 
known detector can detect something moving 
faster than the light the particle emits. 

Twenty -first century star trekkcrs will 
shake their heads in wonderment as to why 
twentieth century physicists were so menu 
mentally mistaken as to believe the relativity 
philosophy; to assume that the energy, mass, 
length, and time dimenskMis of a star ship 
can, in reality, literally depend on the veloc- 
ity of a stream of photons; nl to misinter- 
pret a functional (mathemnical) relation be- 
tween them for a literal caitsnal one.

Dear Jim, 

I was fascinated by Robert Hawkins’ letter 
in the July 1976 issue about my chapter on 
“First Contact . in Cultures Beyond the 
Earth. He seems to have a fine sense of dis- 
regard for facts and logic. 

I admit that I occasionally suffer from the 
author’s syndrome of inference, assuming 
knowledge the reader may not have. One 
problem was the omission in the book of the 
following sentence: 

“In a way,. .the whole idea of de- 
tecting a superior technology by its 
waste heat is absurd. It is a little like 
trying to analyze another culture by 
its garbage. Not overly reliable, but a 
start.” 

I am quite familiar with the archaeologist’s 
love for middens. However, archaeology 
only infers and extrapolates a culture from 
its physical remains. These remains give us a 
great deal of information about the imple- 
ments that were used, but very little about 
such things as family organization or moral 
beliefs. Waste heat from interstellar societies 
and garbage from terrestrial societies are 
merely physical indicators of their existence; 
alone, they are insufftcient to analyze a cul- 
ture. “Culture" is not a geographic concept. 

A classic example for my point may be 
found in “Digging the Weans,” by Robert 
Nathan, which appeared in Judy Metril’s 
“Best of the Year” collection, SF 57 
(Gnome Press, 1957). Although fiction, it il- 
lustrates the fallacy of the archaeological 
“educated guess.” 

I would also like to remind Mr. Hawkins 
of the origin of the “LGM” pulsars — a 
prime example of the misinterpretation of 
electromagnetic “garbage.” 

I recommend an excellent book by Robert 
C. Dunnell, Systematics in Prehistory (Free 
Press, 1971). Rather than accepting the old 



school of archaeology “which viewed itself 
as doing ethnographies of dead peoples” (p. 
3), he draws on the new school’s distinction 
of function: “the technical recovery aspects 
of the- field will herein be called archaeol- 
ogy, and the academic discipline . refer- 
red to as prehistory.” (Ibid.) 

Prehistorians do not study “culture” or 
past “societies” or “man’s past.” The only 
tangible phenomenon is the artifact. Confus- 
ing the means of explanation (culture, soci- 
ety, etc.) with the phenomena to be 
explained (artifacts) only results in inconsis- 
tency and untestable conclusions. 

I take umbrage at Hawkins’ arrogant dis- 
missal of my statement on evolutionary 
timescales (p. 45). Perhaps my esteemed cri- 
tic believes I fabricated the numbers because 
they sounded impressive? It may be that no 
one ever bothered to inform him that those 
little numbers suspended at the end of the 
sentence indicate a footnote. In this case, the 
source was P.H.A. Sneath’s Planets and Life 
(Funk and Waghalls, 1970), p. 155. 

Any biology text or encyclopedia will tell 
you that primitive plant and animal life 
evolved during the early Pre-Cambrian era, 
over 3.2 billion years ago; birds and mam- 
mals began to evolve from reptiles around 
the time of the early Mesozoic (Triassic 
period), approximately 200. million years 
ago. Don’t take my word for it; confirmation 
for these datings may also be found in 
Shklovskii and Sagan’s Intelligent Life in the 
Universe (1966), pp. 221-224 and 227; L.E. 
Orgel’s The Origin of Life (1973), pp. 26-30; 
and Cyril Ponnamperuma’s The Origin of 
Life (1972), pp. 121-130. Need 1 go on? 

If indeed, as Robert Hawkins suggests, 
Jerry Pournelle dissected Cultures Beyond 
the Earth “with one hand in his back poc- 
ket,” I would not be surprised. Jerry is quite 
competent at both science fact and fiction. 

But considering the content of his letter, I 
hate to think where Hawkins had his hand.

Dear Mr, Baen, 

Having read Alter Ego’s impassioned plea 
for a by-line (and mentioned on the cover 
too!), I must take pen in paw and say I think 
it's a great idea. Dick Geis is readable but 
Alter is more. He’s impassioned, venemous, 
prejudiced, etc. All the things that make a 
columnist good reading. Couldn't you just let 
him have the magazine?

Dear Dr. Poumelle, 

The May '76 Galaxy was my first look at 
Galaxy in some years; I bought it for the 
Zelazny serial, which I’m desperately trying 
to avoid starting until part III hits the street. 



but in the meantime found that the rest of the 
mag was quite good. Mr. Baen is entitled to 
a good scratching behind the ears; he seems 
a very competent editor. 

However, I’m writing you. Your article on 
the O’Neill colonies was quite interesting, 
but more so was your apparent philosophy 
behind it. It is really tremendously encourag- 
ing to find the Space Cadets coming back 
out of the closets we were all driven into in 
the late 1960’s. This letter will be too short 
to have much rational content, as 1 have to 
get notes off to NSI and the L5 society, but I 
wanted to thank you for bringing them to my 
attention.
