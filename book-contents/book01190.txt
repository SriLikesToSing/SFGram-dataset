NOVELETTES 

DOWN AND OUT, Larry Niven 5 

The State had brought Corbell (Mark II) to life by 
decanting the DNA from a violated "corpsicle" (Cor- 
bell, Mark I) into the living body of a brain-wiped 
criminal — so that he might seed the stars with life. 

But instead, Corbell the Rebel has chosen to dive 
for the Galactic Core! 

THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS, John Varley 46 

Wherein an artist of a new kind battles for her very 
existence — and loses. Again, and again, and 
again. 

SHORT STORIES 

ONLY OUTLAWS AND WOMEN, Thomas Deiker 26 

Straight fantasy or ethological allegory— you decide. 

But either way this grim little extrapolation of the 
animal-in-man amply demonstrates that there are 
worse things than being human. 

A BETTER TIME, Alex Dunne 76 

Poor guy, he could have anything he wanted — 
except life itself. 

STORYMAKER, P.J. Plauger 142 

For a teller-of-tales the difference between fiction 
and reality is a very hazy thing. No wonder they 
sometimes get confused. (And congratulations to 
Mr. Plauger, this year's winner of the John W. 

Campbell Award for Best New Writer.)

GALAXY 




The naming of names was im- 
portant to Corbell. Alone in his lit- 
tle universe, dissociated from all 
mankind, with only himself and his 
bland-voiced computer to talk to, 
Corbell hung ’tags on everything. 

He called himself Jay bee Corbell. 

Yes, it was a major decision. For 
awhile he was calling himself 
CORBELL Mark II (Corpsicle Or 
Rebellious Brain-Erasure: Lousy 
Loser). He gave that up after the 
shape of his new nose stopped 
bothering him, after he got used to 
the look and feel of his shorter arms 
and slender hands, his alien body. 
There were no mirrors on the ship. 

What he called the Kitchen was a 
wall with slots and a menu display 
screen. The opposite wall was the 
Health Club: the exercise parapher- 
nalia and the outlets that would turn 
this chamber into sauna or shower 
or steam bath. The medical dispen- 
sary and diagnostic tools were 
Forest Lawn: the cold sleep tank 
was also in that room. 

The control room was a hollow 
sphere with a remarkable chair in 
the exact center, surrounded by a 
horseshoe bank of controls, and ap- 
proached via a catwalk of metal 
lace. That chair would assume a 
fantastic variety of positions, and it 
gave indecently good massages. The 
spherical wall could disappear to 
display the black sky as if Corbell 
and the control bank floated alone 
in space. It would display textbooks 
on astronomy or astrophysics or 
State history, or updated diagrams 

6 



of the ship. Corbell called it the 
Womb Room. 

The autopilot-computer could be 
voice operated from anywhere 
aboard. Or there was the computer 
link: a helmet like a hair dryer with 
a thick cord attached, that would 
plug Corbell directly into the com- 
puter’s senses. Corbell was afraid to 
use it. He was afraid to personalize 
the computer. He spoke to it only to 
give orders and request information, 
and he named it “Computer”. 

But he dithered for months before 
naming the great seeder ramship he 
had stolen from Pierce and the 
State. Don Juan, he called it, for its 
phallic overtones. 

Trivial decisions. .but that was 
Corbell’s problem. He had already 
made his major decisions. That was 
his finest hour, when he broke free 
of Pierce the checker and drove for 
the galactic core. Don Juan should 
have capped his career then, by 
blowing up. 

* * * 

Pierce the checker had explained 
it all. 

He had been — someone had 
been — Jerome Branch Corbell the 
architect. Someone named Corbell, 
dying of cancer, had declined to die 
as anyone else died. This Corbell 
had had himself entombed in a 
double-walled coffin, the outer fill- 
ed with liquid nitrogen He had 
hoped to be reawakened after medi- 
cal science solved twin problems: a 



GALAXY 



cancer cure, and a cure for the 
damage done by ice crystals ruptur- 
ing cell walls. 

It hadn’t worked out that way. 

Later there had been a criminal. 
CORBELL Mark II never knew his 
name or his crime. The State had 
wiped a criminal’s personality, 
memories, self. Into the empty 
brain the State had played electrical 
currents trapped in the frozen brain 
of Jerome Corbell. The State had 
ground this Corbell into hamburger 
and leeched the hamburger for 
memory RNA; this they had in- 
jected into a criminal's veins. 

“Jerome Corbell is dead,” Pierce 
the checker had explained. “I could 
have given you his intact skeleton 
for a souvenir.” The new Corbell 
had no more civil rights than a dead 
man. 

In practical terms, the State had 
created a man with a lust for pri- 
vacy and an internal self-sufficiency 
very rare among State citizens. 
Such a man would have had to 
adapt to an unfamiliar culture any- 
way; had in fact volunteered for that 
task. Why should he not postpone 
that adaptation for two hundred 
years, while he guided a seeder 
ramship around a bent ring of stars? 
He would return a hero of sorts. He 
would have started a dozen unin- 
habitable worlds on the road to be- 
coming colonies, new territory for 
the State. 

The new Corbell was to be a 
rammer. His alternative — 

“You’re wrong to call it slave 



labor,” Pierce had told him. “A 
slave can’t quit. Your crime has 
cost you your citizenship, but you 
still have the right to change profes- 
sions. You need only ask for 
another, um, course of rehabilita- 
tion.” But he meant death. Cor- 
bell’s was the fourth personality to 
be tested in that empty body. 

What Pierce expected of Corbell 
was complete, enthusiastic obedi- 
ence. Otherwise there would be a 
fifth personality living in the crimi- 
nal’s body. 

Pierce had had his obedience dur- 
ing Corbell’s entire period of train- 
ing. .training that went rapidly, 
because it was augmented by injec- 
tions of memory RNA. Corbell sus- 
pected where the injections had 
come from. He had obeyed orders 
until he was actually in command of 
the huge spacecraft. Then, around 
the orbit of Jupiter, he had started 
his turn. 

Don Juan was a Bussard ramjet. 
Its fuel was interstellar hydrogen, 
gathered in by magnetic fields and 
burned in fusion fire. Unlimited 
fuel. According to the autopilot- 
computer, Don Juan could acceler- 
ate at one gravity forever. With rel- 
ativistic time compression to help 
him, Corbell could reach the galac- 
tic core in twenty-one years of 
ship’s time. .and return to a world 
seventy thousand years older, his 
crime seventy thousand years for- 
gotten. 

Or perhaps he would not return at 
all. Even the State did not know 



DOWN AND OUT 



7 



what Corbell would find at the 
galactic core. 

Twenty-one years from now he 
could make his next major decision. 

A year on his \yay, and Corbell 
was starving for the sound of 
another voice. 

He dithered. What could Pierce 
say that would be worth the hear- 
ing? He had hung up on Pierce, he 
had had the computer disconnect the 
message laser receiver, as a gesture 
of contempt. That gesture was im : 
portant. Could Pierce know , never 
mind how, that he was no longer 
talking to a void? 

Corbell held lengthy conversa- 
tions about it. “Can I possibly be 
that lonely?” he demanded of him- 
self. “Or that bored? Or that des- 
perate to hear another human voice 
again? Other than my own — ” His 
own voice echoed back from the 
Womb Room walls. 

“Computer,” he said at last, 
“reconnect the message laser re- 
ceiver.” And he waited. 

Nothing. Hours passed, and noth- 
ing. 

He was savage. Pierce must have 
given up. Somewhere in the city 
Pierce would never show Corbell, 
Pierce the checker would be training 
another revived corpsicle. 

The voice caught him at breakfast 
three days later. “Corbell!” 

“Hah?” That was strange. Com- 
puter had never addressed him be- 
fore. Was it an emergency? 

“This is Peerssa, you traitorous 
son of a bitch! Turn this ship 

8 



around and carry out your mis- 
sion!” 

“Get stuffed,” Corbell said, feel- 
ing good. 

“Get stuffed yourself,” said the 
voice of Peerssa, turned suddenly 
silky-smooth. 

Something was wrong here. Don 
Juan was almost half a light year 
from Sol. How could Peerssa. 
“Computer, switch off the message 
laser receiver.” 

“That won’t work, Corbell! I’ve 
beamed my personality into your 
computer, over and over again for 
these past seven months! Turn us 
around or I’ll cut off your air!” 

Corbell yelled something 
obscene. The silence that followed 
commanded attention. The purr of 
air moving through the life support 
system was a sound he never heard 
anymore; but he heard its absence. 

“Turn that back on!” he cried in 
panic. 

“Will you bargain, Corbell?” 

“Never! I’ll throw — ” What was 
heavy and movable? Nothing? “I’ll 
pry the microwave oven loose and 
throw it into the computer! I’ll give 
you nothing but a wrecked ship!” 

“Your mission — ” 

“Shut up l” 

The voice of Pierce the checker 
was silent. Corbell heard the purr of 
moving air. 

What next? If Pierce controlled 
the computer he controlled every- 
thing. Why didn’t he turn the ship 
himself? 

Had he? Corbell climbed up into 

GALAXY 



the Womb Room and settled in the 
control chair. “Full view,’’ he 
commanded. 

He floated alone in space. 

Half a light year of distance had 
not changed the pattern of the stars. 
A year of acceleration had. Don 
Juan was now meeting all light rays 
at. an angle, so that the entire sky 
was puckered forward. 

In his first life, during nights 
spent aboard a small boat, Corbell 
had learned a nodding acquaintance 
with the constellations. Sagittarius 
was just where he had left it, di- 
rectly overhead. A ring of white 
flame around and below him was 
hydrogen guided and constricted to 
fuse in stellar fire: the exhaust of 
his drive. Sol was a hot pink point 
beneath his feet. .and something 
flickered across it. 

Corbell, staring, made out a 
humanoid form barely blacker than 
space, walking toward him across 
the stars. Coming close. 

Narrow features, light hair. .it 
was Pierce. Corbell watched, barely 
breathing. Pierce was as big as Don 
Juan. Pierce was angry. 

Corbell said, “Computer, get that 
mannequin off my screen.” 

The figure vanished. 

Corbell resumed breathing. 
“Pierce, or Peerssa, or Computer, 
or whatever name you will answer 
to, I give you your orders. You will 
proceed to the galactic axis under 
one gravity of acceleration, making 
turnover at midpoint. You will take 
all necessary steps to guard my life 

DOWN AND OUT 



and the integrity of the ship, subject 
to this mission. Now speak if you 
like.” 

The voice of Pierce the checker 
said, “I prefer Peerssa.” 

Corbell sighed his relief. “So do 
I. Are you in fact under my or- 
ders?” 

“Yes. Corbell, there are things 
we must discuss. You owe your 
very existence to the State. You’ve 
stolen a key to the survival of man- 
kind itself! How many seeder ram- 
ships do you think will succeed in 
converting alien atmospheres to 
something men can breathe? Or do 
you think that men will never need 
to leave the Earth?” 

“Computer, you will henceforth 
answer to the name Peerssa. Peers- 
sa, shut the fuck up.” 

Silence. 

★ ★ ★ 

Now Corbell caught himself 
giggling occasionally. It could hap- 
pen any time. At meals, or sitting 
in the Womb Room watching the 
sky, or using the Health Club, he 
would suddenly start giggling. And 
then he couldn’t stop, because 
Peerssa could hear, and Peerssa 
couldn’t answer — 

Peerssa. The naming of names: 
Pierce the checker was far in Cor- 
bell’s past, while Peerssa was a per- 
sonality imposed on a computer’s 
memory bank. The distinction was 
worth remembering. There would 
be major differences between the 



9 



man and the computer. Peerssa had 
different senses. Peerssa would 
never suffer hunger pangs or a frus- 
trated sex urge. Peerssa would 
never exercise or use the rest room. 
Peerssa might well have no sense of 
self preservation. That was worth 
finding out. 

And Peerssa was compelled to 
follow orders. Peerssa was Corbell’s 
slave. 

Two weeks passed before Corbell 
gave in to the urge for conversation. 
Seated in the control chair, floating 
among stars that were already bright- 
er and bluer above than below, 
Corbell said, “Peerssa, you may 
speak.” 

“Good. You’ve instructed me to 
guard your life and the ship. I can’t 
maintain one gravity all the way 
without killing you and wrecking 
the ship.” 

“Don’t lie to me,” Corbell snap- 
ped. “I checked it out on the com- 
puter before I ever passed Saturn. 
The ram effect works better at high 
velocities, because I can narrow the 
width of the ram fields. Greater 
hydrogen flux.” 

“You used data already in the 
computer. ’ ’ 

“Yes, of course.” 

“Corbell, that data was meant for 
jumps of up to fifty-two light years. 
Not thirty-three thousand. We built 
the field generator as strong as pos- 
sible, but it will not stand one grav- 
ity at your peak velocity. The 
strains will tear it apart. We’ll have 
to decrease thrust starting three 

10 



years from now, if you want to 
live.” 

Pierce the checker had never lied, 
had he? Pierce had never bothered. 
Why lie to a corpsicle? Peerssa was 
something else again. Corbell said, 
“You’re lying.” 

“I deny it. Make up your mind. 
You’ve ordered me not to lie. Am I 
under your orders? If not, why 
don’t I just turn and head for Van 
Manaan’s Star?” 

Corbell gave up. “This ruins my 
itinerary, doesn’t it? How long will 
it take us to reach the Core?” 

“In near-perfect safety, about 
five hundred years.” 

“Give me. .oh, a ninety percent 
chance of getting there alive. How 
long?” 

“Computing. Insufficient data on 
interstellar mass density. We’ll cor- 
rect that on the way. One hundred 
and sixty years four months, confi- 
dence of ten months, all figures in 
ship’s time.” 

Corbell felt cold. That long? 
“Suppose we don’t go direct? We 
could skim above the plane of the 
galaxy — ” 

“ — and thin out the interstellar 
matter. Computing. Good, Corbell. 
We lose some time thrusting later- 
ally at turnover, but we still shave 
some time. One hundred and 
thirty-six years, eleven months, 
confidence of a year and a month.” 

“That still isn’t good.” 

“And you’d spend the same time 
coming home. You’d get home 
dead, Corbell. We could finish your 



GALAXY 



original mission faster than that. 
Well?” 

“For — ” Never say Forget it to a 
computer. “You have your orders. I 
now amend them. Your mission is 
to get us to the galactic axis in 
minimum ship’s time relative, 
ninety percent confidence of getting 
me there alive.” 

“You’ll never see Earth again.” 

“Shut up.” 

* ★ ★ 

“You may speak.” 

Silence. 

“Does it bother you, being cut 
off like that?” 

“Yes, of course it bothers me. 
I’ve been silent for a week. That’s 
four weeks added to our trip time. 
The longer it takes me to persuade 
you, the longer it will take us to 
complete our mission!’’ 

“I could order you to give up 
that idea.’' 

“I would do it. Snarling of my 
circuits might result. Corbell, I ap- 
peal to your sense'of gratitude. The 
State created you, you owe your 
very existence — ” 

“Bullshit.” 

“Is it that easy for you to ignore 
your duty?” 

Corbell swallowed an urge to 
drive his fist through a bank of 
dials. “No, it’s not .easy. Every 
time you raise the holy name of the 
State, something in me snaps to at- 
tention.” 



“Then why not listen to the voice . 
of your social conscience?” 

“Because it’s not my conscience! 
It’s those damn shots! You filled 
me full of memory RNA, and that’s 
where my sense of duty to the State 
is coming from!” 

Peerssa gave it a good dramatic 
pause before he said, insinuatingly, 
“Suppose it’s your conscience after 
all?” 

“I’ll never know, will I? And 
that’s your doing, isn’t it? So live 
with it.” 

“You will never see Earth again. 
Your medical facilities will not keep 
you alive that long.” 

Corbell snorted. “Don’t be silly. 
The medicines and the cold sleep 
tank are supposed to keep me young 
and healthy for the first two 
hundred years. The cold sleep tank 
has a rejuvenating effect, remem- 
ber?” 

“It doesn’t. I lied. You were to 
remain alive for the duration of 
your mission. If the medicines had 
been better, we would have ex- 
tended the mission.” 

“You sons of bitches.” It rang 
true; it fitted well with what Corbell 
knew of the State. 

“Corbell, listen to me. In three 
hundred years the State may dis- 
cover complete rejuvenation. We 
could arrive home in time — ” 

“For non-citizens?” 

No answer. 

“We’re going to the galactic 
axis. You have your orders.” 

“You must enter cold sleep im- 

11 



DOWN AND OUT 



mediately,” Peerssa said in a dead 
voice. 

“Oh?” 

“Your optimum program is ten 
years in cold sleep, six months to 
recover, then cold sleep again. You 
vrtll survive to see the galactic axis, 
barely.” 

“Uh huh. And if you happened 
to forget to wake me up?” 

“That’s your problem. Traitor.” 

II 

• Raw throat. Cramped muscles. 
Eyes that wouldn’t focus. Questing 
hands that found him in a coffin 
with the lid still on. 

Waking from cold sleep was like 
waking from death. This was what 
he had half-expected in 1970, when 
they froze Jerome Cor, bell to stop 
the cancer that was eating him from 
the inside. And he had half- 
expected never to wake. He whis- 
pered, “Peerssa.” 

“Here. Where would I go?” 
“Yeah. Where are we?” 

“One hundred and six light years 
from Sol. You must eat.” 

Suddenly Corbell was ravenous. 
He sat up, rested, then climbed 
down from the tank, treating him- 
self like fragile crystal. He was lean 
as death, and weak. “Fix me a 
snack I can take to the Womb 
Room,” he said. 

“It will be waiting.” 

He felt light-headed. No, he felt 
light. He picked up a large bulb of 
hot soup in the kitchen, and sucked 
at it as he continued to the Womb 



Room. “Give me a view,” he said. 
The walls disappeared. 

The stars blazed violet-white over 
his head. The stellar rainbow spread 
out from there: violet stars in the 
center, then rings of blue, green, 
yellow, orange, dim red. To the 
sides and below there was almost 
nothing: a dozen dim red points, 
and the feathery ring of flame that 
marked his drive. That had dimmed 
too, for Peerssa had pulled the ram 
fields close, and had reddened, be- 
cause the fuel guided into that ring 
was moving at near lightspeed rela- 
tive to the ship. 

Peerssa was bitter. “Are you 
satisfied? Even if we turned back 
now, we have lost over four 
hundred years of Earth time — ” 
“You bore me,” said Corbell, 
though he felt stabbing pain from 
what he would once have called his 
conscience. “What happens next?” 
“Next? You eat and exercise. In 
six months you must be strong and 
fat—” 

“Fat?” 

“Fat. Otherwise you could not 
survive ten years in cold sleep. 
Finish your soup, then exercise.” 
“What do I do for entertain- 
ment?” 

“Whatever you like.” Naturally 
Peerssa was puzzled. The State had 
provided nothing for Corbell’ s en- 
tertainment. 

“Yeah, I thought so. Tell me 
about yourself, Peerssa. We’re 
going to be together a long time.” 
“What do you want to know?”

GALAXY 



“I want to know how you got to 
be this way. What was it like to be 
Peerssa the checker, citizen of the 
State? Start with your childhood.” 

Peerssa was a poor storyteller. He 
rambled. He had to be led by ap- 
propriate questions. But he had more 
than his voice to tell tales with. 

He was an inept motion picture 
director with an unlimited budget. 
On the wall of the Womb Room he 
showed Corbell the farming com- 
munity where he had grown up, and 
the schools of his childhood (sky- 
scrapers with playgrounds on the 
roof), and the animated history texts 
he had studied during his final train- 
ing. The memories were usually 
hazy. Some were shockingly sharp 
and brightly colored: the enormous 
ten-year-old who bullied Peerssa on 
the exercise roof; the older girl who 
showed him sex and thus frightened 
him badly; his Civics teacher. 

Corbell ate and slept and exer- 
cised. He tended Don Juan with the 
half-instinctive love and understand- 
ing absorbed with his rammer train- 
ing. In between, he had from 
Peerssa all the knowledge he had 
not dared demand of Pierce the 
checker. 

He saw views of Selerdor, the 
city he had only glimpsed from a 
rooftop. The buildings were as 
blocky and unimaginative inside as 
out. The carvings at street level 
were in Shtoring, the State lan- 
guage. They were edifying princi- 
ples, rules of conduct, or the life 
stories of State heroes. 



He grew to know Peerssa as well 
as he had known Mirabelle, his 
wife for twenty-two years. In know- 
ing Peerssa he grew to know the 
State. The computer memory held 
what Corbell would have called 
Civics texts. He read those, with 
helpful comments from Peerssa. 

He learned of the two brushfire 
wars that had half destroyed the 
Earth and eventually established the 
State. The State was all-powerful, 
as he had guessed. It was a fascism, 
with distinct overtones of Chinese 
or Japanese Empire. Society was 
drastically stratified. The govern- 
ment controlled every form of in- 
dustrial power generator. Once 
these had been very diverse: dams, 
geothermal plants, temperature dif- 
ferential plants in the ocean depths; 
now they were big fusion generators 
supplemented by rooftop and desert 
solar collectors. But the State 
owned them all. 

Once he asked, ‘‘Peerssa, do you 
know what a water empire is?” 
‘‘No.” 

‘‘Pity. A lot of civilizations were 
water empires. Ancient Egypt, an- 
cient China, the Aztecs. Any 
government that controls irrigation 
completely is a water empire. If the 
State controls electricity, they also 
control the fresh water supply, don’t 
they? I mean, with a population in 
the billions — ” 

“Yes, of course.” 

Musing, he said, “I once asked 
you if you thought the State would 
last fifty thousand years.” 



DOWN AND OUT

“I don’t.” 

“I think the State could last se- 
venty thousand. See, these water 
empires, they don’t collapse. They 
can rot from within, to the point 
where a single, push from the barba- 
rians outside can topple them. But it 
takes that push. There’s no revolu- 
tion in a water empire.” 

‘‘That’s a very strong state- 
ment.” 

‘‘Yeah. Do you know how the 
two-province system works? They 
used to use it in China. Say there 
are two provinces, A and B, and 
they’re both having a famine. What 
you do is, you look at their records. 
If Province A has a record of cheat- 
ing on their taxes or rioting, then 
you confiscate all the grain in Pro- 
vince A and ship it to B, If the rec- 
ords are about equal you pick at 
random. The result is that Province 
B is loyal forever, and Province A 
is wiped out so you don’t worry 
about it.” 

‘‘We rarely have famines. When 
we do — ” It was rare for Peerssa 
not to finish a sentence. 

‘‘There’s nothing more powerful 
than controlling everybody’s water. 
A water empire can grow so feeble 
that a single barbarian horde can 
topple it. But, Peerssa, the State 
doesn’t have any outside.” 

Much later, Corbell learned that 
he had changed his life again. At 
the time he only suspected, from 
Peerssa’s silence, that he had of- 
fended Peerssa. 

And Peerssa was not Pierce. The 



checker was long dead; the comput- 
er personality had never harmed 
Corbell. It was worth remembering. 
Corbell gave up talking about the 
State. Peerssa was loyal to the 
State; Corbell most emphatically 
was not. 

Six months passed. Stars passed 
too. A few passed close enough to 
show like violet windows into Hell, 
and receded like dim red fireballs. 
Corbell was fat, too fat for his own 
tastes, fat enough for Peerssa’s, 
when at last he climbed into the 
great coffin. 

★ * * 

It happened seven times.

‘‘Corbell? Is something wrong? 
Speak, please.” 

Corbell sighed in the cold sleep 
tank. He did not move. He had be- 
come very used to this routine: the 
terrible weakness, the hunger, the 
six months of exercises and of forc- 
ing insipid food down his throat, 
the climbing into the tank to start 
the cycle over. At this, his seventh 
awakening, he felt a deadly reluc- 
tance to wake up. 

“Corbell, please say something. I 
can sense your heartbeat and respi- 
ration, but I can’t see you. Have 
you turned catatonic? Shall I ad- 
minister shock?” 

“Don’t administer shock.” 

“Can you move, or are you too 
weak?”

GALAXY 



He sat up. It made him dizzy. 
Ship’s thrust was very low. “Where 
are we?” 

“Beyond midpoint of our course, 
thrusting laterally to force us back 
into the plane of the galaxy. Pro- 
ceeding according to plan. Your 
plan, not mine. Now I want to 
monitor your health.” 

“Later. Make me soup. I’ll take 
it to the Womb Room.” He moved 
toward the kitchen, bouncing oddly 
in the low gravity. He had aged 
more than the four years he had 
been awake. After each awakening 
the exercises had taken longer to 
build him up again. He felt brittle, 
and ravenous. 

The soup was good. The soup 
was always good. He settled him- 
self in the Womb Room and let his 
eyes roam the dials. Some of the 
readings were frightening. The 
gamma ray flux would have charred 
him in minutes, if the power of the 
ram fields were not guiding the par- 
ticles aside. Other readings made no 
sense. Peerssa had told the truth: 
the seeder ramship was not designed 
for velocities this close to the speed 
of light. Neither were the instru- 
ments and dials. 

And what about Peerssa’s senses? 
Was he flying half blind? 

“Give me a full view,” he said. 

The stellar rainbow had hardened 
and sharpened over seven decades. 
It had lost symmetry too. To one 
side the stars were thickly clustered; 
the arc of blue-whites blazed like 
diamonds in an empress’ necklace. 



To the other, the side that faced in- 
tergalactic space, the rainbow was 
almost dark. Each star was sharply 
defined within its band of color. 
But within the central disc of violet 
stars (dimmer than the blue, but of 
a color that made one squint) was a 
soft white glow: the microwave 
background of the universe, at 3° 
Absolute, boosted to visible light by 
Don Juan’s terrible speed. 

His ship’s drive-flame had be- 
come a blood red fan of light facing 
intergalactic space. Peerssa was 
thrusting laterally to bend their 
course back into the plane of the 
galaxy. 

“Give me a corrected view,” 
Corbell instructed. 

Now Peerssa worked a kind of 
fiction. From the universe he per- 
ceived through the senses on Don 
Juan s hull, he extrapolated a pic- 
ture of the universe seen at rest, and 
he painted that picture around the 
wall of the Womb Room. 

The galaxy was incomparably 
beautiful, a whirlpool of light 
spread out across half the universe. 
Corbell looked ahead of him for his 
first view of the galactic core. It 
was there, just brighter than the 
rest, and hazy, without definition. 
He was disappointed. He had 
thought the close-packed ball of 
stars would flame with colors. He 
could pick out no individual stars; 
only a vague glow around a central 
bright point. Behind him the stars 
were similarly blurred. 

“I’m getting poor definition in 

15 



DOWN AND OUT 



the view aft,” Peerssa volunteered. 
“The light is drastically red- 
shifted.” 

‘‘And forward?” 

“This is not according to theory. 
I would have, expected more defini- 
tion within the core. There must be 
a great deal of interstellar matter 
blocking the light. Even so. I 
need more data.” 

Corbell didn’t answer. A multiple 
star cluster had caught his eye, half 
a dozen brilliant points whirling 
frantically as they came toward 
him. They passed on the right, still 
jiggling madly, and froze in place 
as they came even. 

“The next time that happens, I’d 
like to see an uncorrected view.” 
“I’ll call you, but you won’t see 
much.” 

So here he was at the halfway 
point, with his destination in sight. 
No man before him could have seen 
the glow of the galactic core, or the 
frantically spinning star cluster 
flashing past at this close to light- 
speed. His enemy’s soul had be- 
come Corbell’s slave. 

Corbell flies toward the core suns 
like a moth toward a flame, expect- 
ing death. But he has his victories. 

He finished his anonymous soup. 
Don Juan's kitchen and/or chemis- 
try lab supplied just enough taste, 
just enough variety, to keep a State 
non-citizen from cutting his throat. 
On such fare he must grow 
fat. .and exercise to distribute the 
fat. Lately it tended to settle in a 
pot belly, which was no help at all. 

16 



He was getting old. Despite the 
cold sleep tank and all the 
medicines available, he would be 
decrepit before they reached the 
core suns. 

His second life should have been 
more like his first. He had hoped to 
make friends, to carve out some 
kind of career. .he had been fro- 
zen at age forty-four, there would 
have been time. .time even for a 
marriage, children. 

Things would look better when 
he had built up some strength. He 
could go on an oxygen drunk. On 
request Peerssa would fill the cabin 
with pure oxygen, while lecturing 
Corbell on the adverse medical ef- 
fects for as long as Corbell would 
let him. 

“About now you usually start tell- 
ing me my duty,” he said, 

“There’s no point,” said Peersa. 
“We’re decelerating now. We’ll be 
among the core suns before we can 
brake to a stop.” 

Corbell smiled. “Anyone but you 
would have given up sooner. Ex- 
pand my view of the core suns, 
please.” 

The hub of the galaxy rushed to- 
ward him. Dark clouds with stars 
embedded in them surrounded a 
bright core. They looked like churn- 
ing storm clouds. They had changed 
position since his last waking 
period. 

But the core itself was a flat fea- 
tureless glow, except for a single 
bright point at the center. “The in- 
terstellar matter must be almighty 



GALAXY 



thick in there. Can our ram fields 
handle it?” 

“If we give up thrust and settle 
for shielding the life support system 
and nothing else, you’ll be amazed 
at what we can handle.” 

“I'll be dying anyway, of old 
age.” 

“Corbell, there is a way you 
can go home again.” 

“ Dammit , Peerssa, have you 
been lying to me?" 

“Calm down, Corbell. There is a 
way to make you young, if you’re 
willing. You can understand why I 
didn’t raise the subject before.” 

“I sure can. Why now? Why 
would you do this for someone who 
betrayed your precious State?” 
“Things have changed, Corbell. 
By now we may be the last rem- 
nants of the State. And you 
weren’t even a citizen.” 

“And you are?” 

“1 am a human personality im- 
posed on a computer’s memory 
banks. I could never be a citizen. 
You could have been. Such as you 
are, you may well represent the 
State. The State may not survive the 
seventy thousand years we will be 
gone. You are worth preserving." 

“Thank you.” Unreasonably, 
Corbell was touched. 

“The State may exist only in 
your memory. I'm glad you forced 
me to teach you Speech. I’m glad I 
told you so much about myself. 
You must live.” 

“Make me young,” Corbell said 
with the fervor of a man growing

old much too fast. “What does it 
take?” 

“We have the equipment to take 
a clone from you. You surely find 
nothing strange about the concept of 
cloning?” 

“We kntfw about it. Cloning of 
carrots, anyway. But — ” 

“We can clone men. We can 
clone you. Let the individual grow 
in sensory deprivation, in your cold 
sleep tank. We can record your 
memories and play them into the 
clone’s blank mind.” 

“How? Oh, of course, the com- 
puter link.” The link was a direct 
telepathic control over the comput- 
er. Corbell had never dared use it. 
He had been doubly afraid of it 
since Peersa became the computer. 
Peerssa might use it to take him 
over. 

Peerssa said, “We will also need 
injections of your memory RNA.” 
Corbell yelped. “You’re talking 
about grinding me up into chemi- 
cally leeched hamburger!” 

“I’m talking about making a 
young man of you.” 

“It wouldn’t be me, you mad- 
man!” 

“The new individual would be as 
much Jaybee Corbell as you are.” 
“Thanks! Thanks a lot! You told 
me what happened to the real 
Jaybee Corbell. A brainwiped crim- 
inal! No, thanks. There isn’t going 
to be a CORBELL Mark III.” 

* ★ ★ 



Six months later he was not ready 
for the cold sleep tank. “You’ve 
been shirking your exercises,” 
Peerssa said. 

Corbell had just finished an exer- 
cise period. Tendonitis had led him 
to favor his arms, these past two 
months, but they hurt anyway, two 
hot wires in his shoulders. “It’s 
your schedule,” he grumbled. 

“I would have to thaw you early. 
Coming out of cold sleep is a trau- 
ma. You want to reach the galactic 
core in optimum condition. Take 
another two months awake.” 

“Fine. I hate that damn tank 
anyway.” Corbell slumped in a web 
chair. In near-free fall he was too 
prone to lose muscle tone. His pot 
belly protruded. 

He had nobody else to talk to, 
and Peerssa had endless patience. It 
should have been good timing when 
Peerssa said, “Have you given any 
thought to regaining your youth?” 

Corbell shuddered. “Forget it.” 
Hastily, “I don’t mean that literal- 
ly. If you wipe it from your mem- 
ory banks you’ll only think of it 
again later.” 

“I take it you’ve cancelled your 
command. What is your objec- 
tion?” 

“It’s ugly.” 

“As things stand now, you will 
die of aging on the return voyage. 
The cold sleep treatment is not 
enough.” 

“I will not be ground up for 
hamburger. Not again.” 

“You know the details of Don 



18 



GALAXY 



Juan’s excrement recycling system. 
Do you find that ugly?’ ’ 

“Since you ask, yes.” 

“But you eat the food and drink 
the water.” 

Corbel! didn’t answer. 

“You would be a young man 
when it was over.” 

“No. No, I would not.” Corbell 
was shouting. “I would be ham- 
burger! Contaminated hamburger, 
garbage to be recycled for the fo- 
b-benefit of your damn’ clone! He 
wouldn't even be a good copy, be- 
cause you’d be shoving some of 
your own thoughts in through the 
computer link!” 

“You have no loyalty to anything 
but yourself.” 

Corbell thought: I can shut him 
up. Any time. He said, “Whatever 
it is 1 am, I’ll settle for it.” 

“The only man who ever saw the 
galactic core. A wonderful thing.” 
Peerssa had had time and practice to 
develope that sarcastic tone. “What 
will you do afterward, once your 
sole ambition in life is satisfied? 
Will you order me to self-destruct? 
A grand funeral pyre for your end- 
ing, a fusion flame that alien eyes 
might see?” 

Then Corbell did Peerssa an in- 
justice. “Is that what’s been bother- 
ing you? Tell you what,” he said. 
“After we have our look around the 
core suns, why don’t we drop some 
package probes on appropriate 
planets? You can reach Earth alive. 
By the time the State sends ships, 
the algae will have turned some re- 

DOWN AND OUT 



ducing atmospheres to oxygen at- 
mospheres. You can take my 
mummy home, too, in the cold 
sleep tank. Maybe they’ll want it 
for a museum.” 

“You will not be young again?” 
“We’ve been through that.” 
“Very well. Will you go to the 
Womb Room, please? I have a 
great deal to show you.” 

Mystified and suspicious, Corbell 
went. 

Peerssa had set up displays in the 
Womb Room walls. There was a 
greatly enlarged, slightly blurred 
view of the galactic core as Corbell 
had seen it six months ago: drasti- 
cally flattened, the glow of the suns 
blurTed by interstellar matter. There 
was a contrasting enlargement of 
the center of the spiral galaxy in 
Andromeda. There was a diagram: 
an oddly contoured disc cut down 
the center. Corbell frowned, won- 
dering where he had seen that be- 
fore. 

Peerssa spoke as he settled him- 
self in the control chair. “I have 
never known why you chose the 
galactic axis as your destination. I 
may never understand that.” 

The core of Andromeda Galaxy 
glowed with colored lights. Corbell 
pointed. “For that. For beauty. For 
the same reason I once went 
through the Grand Canyon on 
muleback. Can you imagine a 
planet on the edge of that sphere? 
The nightsl” 

“I can do better. I can put it be- 
fore you, by extrapolation.” And 



19 



Peerssa did. Corbell’s chair floated 
above a dark landscape. The sky 
was jammed with stars competing 
for space, big and little, red and 
blue and pure white, and a spinning 
pair that threw out a spiral of red 
gas. The sky turned. A wall of 
blackness rose in the east, ten 
thousand cubic light years of dust 
cloud. .and then the Womb Room 
was as it had been, while Corbell 
was still gaping. 

“I could have done that before 
your first term in the cold sleep 
tank. We could have completed 
your mission, seeded the worlds as- 
signed to you, and I could have 
displayed that sky for you at any 
time. Why didn’t you say some- 
thing?” 

“It’s not real. Peerssa, didn’t any 
of your aristocrats ever go cruising 
through, say, Saturn’s rings, just for 
the joy of it?” 

“For the mining possibilities — ” 

"Mining. If they said that, they 
lied.” 

“Are you sorry you came?” 

Why had he kept on? Knowing 
that the trip would take more than 
twenty -one years, that it would take 
his life , had not changed his mind. 
Corbell the reconstituted corpsicle 
would never carve out a normal life 
for himself. Very well, he would do 
something memorable. 

“No. Why should I be sorry? I 
expected strangeness in the galactic 
core. I was right, wasn’t I? It’s noth- 
ing like other galaxies, and I’m 
the first to know it.” 



‘‘You’re insane. Imagine my 
amazement. Never mind. Your 
choice has had unforeseen conse- 
quences. We expected a close-packed 
sphere of millions of suns averaging 
a quarter to half a light year apart, 
with red giant suns predominating. 
Instead, we find this: the matter in 
the core forced into a disc that flat- 
tens drastically toward the center, 
with a tremendously powerful 
source of infrared and radio energy 
at the axis.” 

“Like your diagram?” 

‘‘Yes, very like this diagram 
which I find in my data banks, a 
representation of the structure of the 
accretion disc around the black hole 
in Cygnus X-l.” 

‘‘Oh!” He had not seen that 
diagram during his rammer training. 
His rammer training had not even 
told him how to avoid stellar-sized 
black holes, because there were 
none to be expected on his planned 
course. He had seen something very 
like that diagram in an article in 
Scientific American! 

“Yes, Corbell. Your wonderland 
of lights is being absorbed by a 
black hole of galactic mass. Its spin 
must be enormous, from the way it 
has flattened the mass of stars 
around it. Eventually the entire 
galaxy may disappear into — 
Corbell? Are you ill?” 

“No,” Corbell said, his hands 
covering his face, muffling his voice. 

“Don’t be depressed. This is our 
chance for life.” 

“What?” 



20 



GALAXY 



“A thin chance to see Earth 
again before you die. A unique ex- 
perience, win or lose. Isn’t that 
what you want? Let me ex- 
plain. .” 

IV 

At the thirteenth awakening he 
tried to sit up too fast. He woke 
again, dizzy, flat on his back in the 
coffin, with Peerssa calling his ear. 
“Corbell! Corbell?” 

“Here. Where would I go?” 

“Be more careful. Lie there for a 
minute.” 

Lean as death he was, and old. 
Arthritis grated in his knobby joints. 
With the familiar hunger came 
nausea. He ran a hand over his 
scalp — he had been half bald when 
he entered Forest Lawn — and more 
of his hair came away. 

“Where are we?” 

“One month from target and 
closing. The view will please you.” 
He emerged from the cold sleep 
tank like a sick Dracula. He made 
his limping way to the kitchen, then 
to the Health Club. His muscles 
were slack and tended to cramp. 
The exercises were hard on him. 
But the pain and the nausea and the 
creeping years meant little. He felt 
good. At worst he had found a 
brand new way to die. 

He asked of the ubiquitous mi- 
crophones, “Suppose we go too far 
in? We won’t ever die, will we? 
We’d be stopped above the 
Swartzchild radius.” 

“Only to an outside observer. 



Not to ourselves. Are you about to 
change my orders?” 

Some minutes later he eased him- 
self into the Womb Room chair. He 
sipped the last of the broth. “Full 
view.” 

Don Juan raced above a sea of 
churning stars. In a normal galaxy 
they would have been crowded 
enough. Here, forced into a plane 
by the spin of the giant black hole 
at the center, they were crowded to 
death. Dying stars burned with a 
terrible light. They stood like 
torches in a field of candles. It must 
be common enough for star to ram 
star here, or for tides to rip stars 
apart. 

Commoner toward the center, 
Corbell thought. The center of the 
sea burned very bright ahead of 
him. He could see no dark dot at 
the axis. He hadn't expected to. 

“How far away are we in normal 
space?” 

“Rest space? Three point six 
light years.” 

“No problems?” 

“I believe I can hold us above 
the plane of the disc until we have 
passed that very active swelling 
ahead of us, between two and three 
light years from the singularity.” 

Corbell looked down at his drive 
flame, a wisp of white flame be- 
tween his feet. It was dim. There 
was very little matter above the 
disc, he guessed, “Suppose you 
can’t? Suppose we have to go 
through it?” 

“You’ll never feel a thing. That 

21 



DOWN AND OUT 



region is where the stars lose their 
identity. They become streamers of 
dense plasma with nodules of neu- 
tronium in them. Most of the light 
comes fron\ there. Beyond, there is 
very great flattening and some radi- 
ation due to friction in the matter 
spiralling inward.” 

‘‘What about the black hole?” 

‘‘I still don’t have a view of it. I 
estimate a circumference of two 
billion kilometers and a mass of one 
hundred million solar masses. The 
ergosphere will be large. We should 
have no trouble choosing a path 
through it.” 

‘‘You said circumference?” 
‘‘Should I have given you the 
radius? The radius of a black hole 
may be infinite.” 

There was simply no grasping the 
size of that disc of crushed stars. It 
was like flying above another uni- 
verse. At two billion kilometers, the 
black hole would almost have con- 
tained the orbit of Jupiter; but if 
Corbell could have seen past that 
swelling ahead, that Ring of Fire, 
he would have found the black hole 
invisibly small. 

Light caught the corner of his 
eye, and he turned to see a super- 
nova glaring white-on-red. He’d just 
missed seeing a sun torn apart by 
tides, its ten-million-degree heart 
spilled across the sky. 

He asked what he had never 
asked before. ‘‘Peerssa, what are 
you thinking?” 

“I don’t quite know how to an- 
swer that.”

“Try.” 

“I’m not thinking anything. My 
decisions are made. They are 
mathematically rigorous. I face no 
choices.” 

“How are you going to find 
Earth?” 

“I know where Sol will be in 
three million years.” 

“ Three — Won’t it be more like 
seventy thousand?” 

“We’re diving deep into a tre- 
mendous gravity field. Time will be 
compressed for us. The black hole 
is large enough that tides will not 
tear us apart, but we’ll lose almost 
three million years before I fire the 
fusion motor. What more can I do? 
The odds are finite that we will find 
Sol. Or the State may have spread 
through a million cubic light years 
of space before we arrive.” 

“The odds are finite. Peerssa, 
you’re strange." But Corbell felt no 
urge to laugh. Seventy thousand 
years BC, there had been Neander- 
thal Man and a few Cro-Magnon, 
Humans. Three million years ago, 
nothing but a club-swinging, meat- 
eating ape. What would inhabit the 
Earth three million years from now? 

★ * * 

Now Corbell spent most of his 
time in the Womb room, watching 
the accretion disc swirl past. He 
liked the uncorTected view, the dis- 
play that showed the universe dis- 
torted by Don Juan's velocity. ' 
Since turnover the ship had shed 



GALAXY 



most of its Tau factor. Don Juan 
had been moving faster after Cor- 
bell’s first term in the cold sleep 
tank. But it was still traveling near 
lightspeed, and accelerating steadily 
under the pull of a point-source one 
hundred million times the mass of 
the Sun. The accretion disc showed 
rainbow-colored ahead of him, with 
the Ring of Fire a violet-white hill 
coming near. The stars were jam- 
med together; you couldn’t tell one 
from the next unless the next had 
exploded. They graded back 
through the rainbow until the sea of 
flame behind Don Juan was deep 
red and frozen in place, with the 
occasional supernova showing 
yellow-white or greenish-white. 

The Ring of Fire — the swollen 
region where the heat trapped 
within the streaming star-stuff grew 
even more powerful than the black 
hole’s compression effect — came 
near. It was blinding-bright before 
Corbell gave up. “Reduce that 
light,” he said, half-covering his 
eyes. 

“I’ve cut it to ten percent. Let 
me know when I must cut it 
again.” 

“Are you all right? Will it bum 
out your cameras?” 

“I think not. Remember, you 
were to dive almost into Sol to de- 
celerate at the end of your mission. 
We can handle high intensities of 
light.” 

The Ring of Fire was a flattened 
doughnut twenty light years in cir- 
cumference, a quarter of a light 



year thick: four or five cubic light 
years of green-to-blue-white star, 
with every possible grade of fusion 
and fission going on in it. As if 
Hell were a tremendous moun- 
tain. .coming near. .and Don 
Juan crossed it on a fan of fusion 
flame, thrusting hard. Corbell felt 
the thrust drop away. He sat for- 
ward as the ship dropped along the 
inner gradient and left the Ring of 
Fire behind, a dull red wall. The 
inner accretion disc was drastically 
thinner, savagely compressed. Cor- 
bell peered toward where the black 
hole ought to be. All he saw was 
more star-matter, hurtingly violet- 
white at the center. 

It was all happening terribly fast 
now. Minutes left, or seconds. 
Peerssa was firing the attitude jets 
at strange angles. There were no 
stars to see in this inner disc: no de- 
tail at all. It was as uniform as 
peanut butter. 

“It’s all neutronium,” said 
Peerssa. “It even has some of neu- 
tronium’s crystalline structure, but 
that structure is constantly breaking 
up. I can see the X-ray flashes, like 
ripples.” 

“I wish I had some of your 
senses.” 

“The computer link — ” 

“No.” 

Behind them the Ring of Fire 
reddened further and was gone. The 
inner disc grew brighter and bluer 
and was suddenly past. In the last 
instant Corbell saw the black hole. 

The onboard fusion drive roared

beneath him, slammed him down 
into his chair. Light exploded in his 
face. It resolved: a blaze of violet 
light ahead of him, a broad ring of 
embers around it. Elsewhere, black. 

Peerssa. said, “There is some- 
thing we must discuss.” 

“Wait a minute. Give me a 
chance to resume breathing.” 
Peerssa waited. 

Corbell said, “It’s over? We 
lived through that?” 

“Yes.” 

“Well done.” 

“Thank you.” 

“What’s happening now?” 
“Firing a reaction drive within 
the ergosphere of a black hole has 
driven us dangerously near light- 
speed. I am using the ram fields to 
ward interstellar matter from us. I 
won’t be able to use them as a drive 
until we can shed some velocity. 
We will reach the vicinity of Sol in 
thirteen point eight years, ship’s 
time, unless we overshoot.” 

“Did we really lose three million 
years?” 

“Yes. Corbell, I must have your 
opinion. Will the State have col- 
lapsed over three million years?” 
Corbell laughed a little shakily. 
“We’ll be lucky if there’s anything 
like human beings left. I can’t guess 
what they’ll be like. Three million 
years! I wish there’d been another 
way to do it.” He stood up. He was 
suddenly ravenous. 

Peerssa answered. “I was ordered 
to preserve your life and the integ- 
rity of the ship, but never your con- 



venience. My loyalty is to the 
State.” 

Corbell stopped. “What’s that 
supposed to mean?” 

“There was another way to use 
the black hole, once we knew it 
existed. At midpoint we could have 
continued to accelerate. We would 
have spent perhaps eighty years 
reaching the galactic hub. If we 
passed near enough to the black 
hole, its spin would have bent our 
hyperbolic path back upon itself, 
though we would still have been 
well outside the ergosphere. 
Another eighty years of ship’s time 
would have returned us to Sol, sev- 
enty thousand years after your de- 
parture.” 

“You thought of that? And you 
didn’t do it?” 

“Corbell, I have no data on the 
nature of water empires. I had to 
take your word entirely.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

His answer came in Corbell’s re- 
corded voice. “/ think the State 
could last seventy thousand years. 
See, these water empires, they don’t 
collapse. They can rot from within, 
to the point where a single push 
from the barbarians outside can 
topple them. But it takes that push. 
There's no revolution in a water 
empire." 

Corbell said, “I don’t — ” 

“ A water empire can grow so 
feeble that a single barbarian horde 
can topple it. But Peerssa, the State 
doesn’t have any outside." 

“ — I don’t understand.” 



24 



GALAXY 




“The State could last seventy 
thousand years or more, because all 
of humanity was part of the State. 
There were no barbarian hordes 
waiting hungrily for the State to 
show weakness. The State could 
have grown feeble beyond any pre- 
cedent, feeble enough to fall before 
the hatred of a single barbarian. 
You, Corbell. You.” 

“Me.” 

“Did you exaggerate the situa- 
tion? I thought of that, but I 
couldn’t risk it, and I couldn’t 
ask.” 

He's a computer. Perfect mem- 
ory, rigid logic, no judgement. I 
forgot. I talked to him like a human 
being, and now- “You have heroi- 
cally saved the State from me. I’ll 
be damned.” 



“Was the danger unreal? I 
couldn’t ask. You might have lied.” 
“I never wanted to overthrow the 
damn government. All I wanted was 
a normal life. I was only forty-four 
years old! I didn’t want to die!” 
“You could never have had what 
you called a normal life. It was al- 
ready impossible on twenty-one 
ninety. Corbell could have lived a 
normal life by dying of cancer.” 

“I just didn’t. .didn’t see it.” 

“I hoped you would accept the 
cloning method. I could have used 
the computer link to alter the 
clone’s attitudes.” 

“Shut up.” 

Silence. 

“I just don’t want to talk for 
awhile, okay? Just take me 
home.” ★ 



DOWN AND OUT 



25 



Give to the college 
of your choice! 



The smell of fresh tree moss 
when he woke reminded him of 
something. He blinked back the 
sleep from his eyes, but could not 
drive out the numbness in his mind. 
What was it? He could remember 
the night before, saw a picture of 
himself kicking the old moss out the 
hole in the wall. Somthing about 
this new day. He remembered 
squashing the bugs and giggling, 
and, yes, singing — over and over, 
in the cadence of his early school 
lessons: 

“Tomorrow I’ll be a teacher; to- 
morrow I’ll be a teacher; tomorrow 
I’ll be a teacher.” 

That was it: this was the day, the 
day he had pictured in his mind for 
so long. How long? As long as he 
could remember — as far as he 
knew, forever. 

It was in those early classes that 
Burnface first dreamed of being a 
teacher. Before starting school his 
only interest had been to quiet his 
restless stomach. He fouhd early 
that meant being the strongest, 
fighting to keep what food came his 
way, taking what food he could. In 
school the food and being strong 

ONLY OUTLAWS AND WOMEN 



became tied up in his mind — he 
did not know how — with the 
teacher. The teacher was strong, the 
teacher had food, he threw the food 
out at the square and his women 
took what they wanted. - Later his 
mind began to focus on the teacher 
even when he was not thinking of 
food, and for the first time Burnface 
invested interest, emotion, in some- 
thing outside himself. He was jolted 
into a sense of awe at this man’s 
swaggering power, his unquestioned 
authority, the way he knew all the 
important things there were to 
know. 

He had seen six teachers since 
coming to school, counting Shouter. 
Only one, the first — he couldn’t 
remember his name, the one who 
talked and moved fast — had 

finished his two summers and gone 
to the college. Burnface never 
thought about the college, that was 
too far in the future; his mind did 
not even grasp the possibility. To 
be a teacher was enough. It was 
more than other students consid- 
ered. They were content to finish 
school and remain in the city where 
there was food and safety. 

Burnface rolled off the moss to 
his feet. Fog hung thick on the 
river, less so than on the bank, so 
that from the hole in the wall he 
could see the city in its haze of fog. 
He could smell the river without see- 
ing it, the smell of summer: heavy 
and pungent, not like the fresh 
smell of spring, when the water rose 
on its banks and heavy logs twisted 

27 



like trapped cattle, their flanks shin- 
ing with water. He stepped through 
the debris at the hole to the damp 
earth and left the building without 
looking back at what had been his 
home all this time. To do so would 
have been to weigh an abstraction, 
a task he always found too difficult 
to complete. He found it easier to 
think in simple images, clear pic- 
tures in his mind of himself less 
hungry, more feared — a teacher. 
He could see himself now as a 
teacher, striding back and forth in 
front of the class, towering over 
them on the platform, reciting the 
lessons again and again. He had 
learned them well over the years, 
knew them by heart; that was all he 
needed. When the teacher from col- 
lege came there would be no mis- 
takes. 

But if he thought in concrete im- 
ages, his mind was seldom clouded 
with emotions, and what faced him 
in the city neither frightened nor 
excited him. 

Unnumbered summers ago, the 
day his mother pushed him away and 
refused to feed him, he had gone to 
the school boys’ building by the 
river without looking back, and 
within a few days his mother and 
the working girls’ building in the 
city faded into a part of his mind 
from where he could not call them 
back. 

He had sat on his haunches in 
a cluttered comer and watched the 
other boys, learning where to get 
food and where to sleep. He bullied 



another boy out of a dry spot at the 
back of the building. (He had al- 
ready learned to sort boys into two 
groups in his mind: those who were 
stronger and those who were 
weaker. As he got older fewer and 
fewer proved themselves stronger). 
As with the food he had to fight to 
keep this space of his own, rub his 
scent into it and drive the others 
away. 

The best sleeping place, he soon 
found, was at the hole in the wall. 
The boys there had a better chance 
at night of catching the rats which 
came up from the river to smell out 
the com left to attract them. When 
he was feared more, Burnface in- 
stalled himself at the hole and then 
got most of the rats, and sometimes 
a snake looking for the rats. Once 
he woke to the sound of a wild dog 
nervously sniffing at the opening. 
When it crossed the threshhold 
Burnface shot it, but the dog strug- 
gled even more than the boy in 
whose place he slept. To still it he had 
to take one of the bricks from the 
crumbling wall and smash its head. 

It was the first time in his life that 
his stomach was- silent. When 
he could eat no more he continued 
to nibble at the meat, refusing out 
of long habit to yield the remains to 
the boys who were silently crouch- 
ing around him. After a period of 
confusion, his mind sleepy from the 
food, he finally flung the carcass 
out the hole and it was tom apart at 
the joints in the ensuing struggle. 

Burnface made his way to the 



28 



GALAXY 



river. The river was low, and he 
had to step through the sucking mud 
to cup water to his face. He drank 
deep, his body telling him he would 
not have another chance in the city. 
At the teachers’ building he would 
not have to get his own water and 
food — Shouter’s women would do 
that — but he was not thinking this 
now. 

Leaving the river, he traced the 
footpath by the bank toward the 
hard road that led to school, con- 
scious only of the mud on his legs 
starting to dry and itch. A few steps 
ahead, where another path led 
through the brush to the river, he 
saw a movement and then the blur 
of someone darting across the path. 
Burnface instinctively began slap- 
ping his thigh in warning. It was a 
working girl, followed closely by 
two of the boys from school. 
Across the path the first boy caught 
her by the hair, and the girl 
wheeled with a sneer and flailing 
feet. But the other quickly buried 
his knee in her back and struggled 
to pull the girl’s arms behind her. 
None of them had noticed Burnface, 
who approached slapping his thigh 
with an open palm. Hearing the 
sound, the boys froze, and turned to 
track its source. When they saw 
Burnface they scrambled through 
the brush, spinning the girl around 
and knocking her to the ground in 
their flight. 

The working girl lifted her face 
to him, pulling her upper lip to re- 
veal a full set of shining teeth. She 

ONLY OUTLAWS AND WOMEN 



was hardly grown yet, with small 
breasts and sparse body hair. 

On any other day he would have 
done her himself, even though she 
was not in the mood — probably not 
old enough to be in the mood. He 
preferred it that way, would rather 
take a girl who was not in the mood 
than the ones at the stadium who 
lay on the ground impatient for the 
boys to decide their turns. Some- 
thing in their kicking and scratching 
excited him the way backing off 
another boy excited him. 

But now he was only thinking of 
being a teacher and even this sneer- 
ing girl could not distract him, so 
rather than take her Burnface 
sneered back, and the girl jumped 
to her feet and was gone. 

He continued to the black road 
and followed it toward the school. 
The sun was low and the road not 
yet hot on his feet. He could see the 
large round stadium from the road 
and behind it pictured the school. 
Before all the other images had 
faded except that of being teacher, 
Burnface had shared the others’ 
ambition of becoming one of the 
top boys at the stadium. As a child 
he sat on the sidelines while his 
mother joined the games in the 
field, puzzled at first by the noise 
and confusion. He continued to 
come after leaving his mother, his 
interest growing with time, and 
soon he was slapping thighs with 
the other boys on the sidelines, 
sometimes mimicking the activities 
in the field with girls who were no

more ready than he. That was be- 
fore he went to school, before he 
had his gun. Then the games be- 
came serious, and being strong in 
the field became tied up in his mind 
with food the way being a teacher 
had. 

The boys who won turns with 
girls in the field took his food, and 
his mind came to learn that winning 
girls in the field meant getting more 
food. 

Once when he was chasing a 
lizard among the rotten boards at 
the top of the stadium he looked 
down at the field and from that dis- 
tance could have seen the logic 
which guided the confusing activity 
below. Could have seen, but did 
not. His mind would have had to 
sort things out and compare them. 
He knew all he had to know, 
that the big circle of grass in the 
center of the field was the best cir- 
cle, the one that all the boys tried to 
get a place on, even when rain 
turned its center to matted grass and 
mud. 

The first girl to arrive each af- 
ternoon always went to this circle 
and frettingly stalked its border — a 
border worn bare by that girl and 
countless before her. Outward from 
the center area were less distinct 
circles, with the ones at the 
periphery of the stadium of ambigu- 
ous shape because of less frequent 
walkings. The girls in the circles 
guarded their borders until the boys 
came. Whenever two of them came 
to a point where their areas were 



GALAXY 



closest, they flashed their teeth and 
kicked up dirt with their feet, just 
as they did when a girl without an 
area of her own came near. 

It was in one of the smaller cir- 
cles at the edge of the stadium that 
Bumface won his first victory, and 
after that he took food at the square 
from all those on the sidelines, as 
the boys in the field had taken his 
food in the past. 

Only girls in the mood for the - , 
games came each afternoon. When 
a girl stopped coming she returned 
after a matter of days unless her 
stomach began swelling with a 
child. These stayed at the working 
girls’ building during the day and 
watched the children who were too 
young to go to the fields. 

When Burnface first started the 
games he rushed to the stadium 
each evening after eating, eager like 
a girl in the mood to claim some 
advantage over his rivals. After he 
was feared more he came late, 
knowing that even if a circle was 
full he could bully another boy 
away. 

Burnface learned to feel in 
his muscles when another boy was 
weaker. He was more certain of a 
boy’s movements than his words, 
and knew from his own muscles if 
he was faster. He could walk 
around a circle where boys had 
spaced themselves out with threats, 
where there was not room for 
another, and could feel when some- 
one on the circle was weak. He felt 
his own body tensing, leaning for-

ward and backward in rhythm with 
his hands, could feel the tension 
build, and knew when he could 
build it more, when the boy was 
about to give way. He knew when 
to stop tho tension, knew when he 
could not win. 

Once he obtained a place on a 
circle he found his hands begin to 
slap in rhythm with the others — a 
slow, measured beat. The first seri- 
ous challenge came when one of the 
boys stepped across the border into 
the grassy area. Everyone slapped 
their thighs faster, but if no one else 
crossed the line the boy had first 
chance with the girl in the ring. If 
someone challenged him by step- 
ping into the circle, all slapping 
stopped except for those two. Be- 
tween them it increased, sometimes 
to a frenzy. When Bumface was in 
the ring he watched the other boy’s 
hands, the quickness of his hands, 
compared them with his own to 
know if he could take him. The 
guns were used only if one of the 
boys stopped slapping his thighs 
and put his hands out to the side. 
This seldom happened at the 
stadium, partly because the 
priorities had long been established 
between the boys, and partly be- 
cause most of them would get a 
turn with a girl in one of the cir- 
cles. Shooting fights usually started 
when a new boy tried to establish a 
position in a group. Bumface had 
never lost a fight. He only chal- 
lenged someone if he was sure he 
could beat him. 



Bumface continued down the 
black road to the stadium, stopping 
at the working girls’ building oppo- 
site it. All the girls were at the 
fields or the river, except for those 
who cared for the infants. One of 
these stood at the entrance, watch- 
ing a child in the street pick through 
a pile of cobs for pieces of com. 
She flashed her teeth at Bumface 
even though she felt safe from him 
here. The child scurried into her 
arms, his legs clasping her swollen 
waist. The girl’s face registered no 
memory in his mind, though he had 
been the last to have her before she 
stopped coming to the stadium. 

Past the working girls’ building 
the road broadened into a large 
square. Faded lines, straight like the 
one down the road, were scattered 
about. This square where he ate, 
cluttered with the refuse of past 
meals, was the focus of all meaning in 
his mind. At one end was the 
stadium and the working girls’ 
building, and at the other, in a 
line, the college, the teachers’ 
building, and the school. The 
square was the one place besides 
the stadium where the school boys 
and the working girls came to- 
gether. 

Each afternoon the girls came 
down the black road to the square 
with the fish they caught in nets 
at the river, carrying or dragging 
them on sticks pushed through 
their mouths and out their gills. The 
teachers gathered on the ledge 
above the square and threw out com

brought from the college. At irregu- 
lar intervals a teacher was sent to 
bring one of the cattle from the 
pens by the river. They dragged it 
bellowing down the black road, 
tight thongs of leather choking off 
its air when it struggled, its nose 
blowing bubbles of mucus and 
sweat striping its flanks. The chil- 
dren ran around the animal and 
prodded it with sticks to rekindle its 
fighting spirit. At the square one of 
the teachers took a large knife and 
struck a blow across its neck. 

Sometimes it died immediately, but 
other times the animal summoned 
its final strength to break free, 
spraying blood as the children 
chased it around the square. The 
teacher stripped its skin, which was 
used to make the belts on which 
the school boys carried their guns. 
Then a heavy knife hacked out por- 
tions of meat for the eager crowd. 

During the frequent years when 
com ran out, the teachers from the 
college led raids on the outlaws’ 
lands which began some three days’ 
journey across the river. Most of 
the outlaws lived alone in caves in the 
hills or under rude leantos covered 
with branches. Finding their hidden 
corn was a troublesome task seldom 
rewarded by the sight of an outlaw 
fleeing in the distance — usually too 
far to catch or shoot. The raiding 
party always searched the place 
where a small band of outlaws lived 
together in a group of huts made 
out of logs — so sturdy that not 
even Bumface with his strong arms 



and legs could knock them down. 
These outlaws not only planted a 
large field of corn each year, but 
had cattle as well, which in their 
haste were sometimes left behind. 

Teachers from the college led the 
raiding party, and even school 
teachers obeyed them without ques- 
tion. In the city they kept guard 
over the store of grain in the col- 
lege, and supervised the planting 
and harvest each year. They 
guarded as well the secrets of mak- 
ing guns and tools used in the fields. 
From the working girls’ building 
Bumface saw the black billows of 
smoke rising from the college. This 
smoke had something to do with the 
guns, but how they made guns with 
fire he had never ventured to guess. 

As he crossed the square 
Burnface had to make his way 
through piles of cobs and scattered 
bones. A layer of soot covered the 
square and the surrounding build- 
ings, making it difficult to see the 
sharp bones. In the winter when it 
was cold the cobs would be used 
with stalks from the harvest to make 
fires, but the bones would remain. 

He came at last to the school. 
Next to it was the teachers’ build- 
ing, where he would live after to- 
day. Except for the college it was 
the best building in. the city, with 
steps that went up to a second floor, 
and windows covered with 
cowhides to keep out the cold of 
winter and the heat of summer. 
Shouter had five women, Bumface 
knew. When he was teacher he 



ONLY OUTLAWS AND WOMEN 



33 



could add to that number. One of 
them was small and skinny. He 
never pictured her with him when 
he thought of living in the teachers’ 
building. 

When lJurnface entered the 
school the other boys were already 
there. He had not pictured it that 
way when he thought about this 
day; in his mind he was at the 
school before the other boys ar- 
rived. Shouter had started class: 

“Man is the best. He is not 
stronger than the bull, but he is the 
best. He is not faster than the dog, 
but he is the best. A man’s gun 
makes him as strong as the bull and 
as fast as the dog. Man shoots, so 
he is the best. Only outlaws and 
women don’t shoot. If a man does 
not shoot, then the dog is as good 
as man, the woman and the outlaw 
is as good as man.” 

There were murmurs around the 
room; there were always murmurs 
around the room when he said that. 

Shouter was the best teacher he 
had ever seen. He made many mo- 
tions with his hands and body, and 
stalked up and down the aisles 
when he taught. It was almost time 
for the harvest. Shouter would go to 
the college at this harvest. Shouter 
loved to taunt the class and dare 
them to fight. When he went around 
the class and pressed his grin 
against the students they would 
shrink back. He did not know that 
Burnface was not afraid, that he 
was just waiting until he was ready. 
Every time Shouter fought with one 



of the students or showed them how 
to draw a gun, Burnface pictured in 
his mind and felt in his muscles 
how fast his own gun would be 
drawn. For some time the picture in 
his mind had shown him to be fast- 
er than Shouter. 

Most fights broke out when a 
new teacher started, with fewer af- 
ter that if no one could beat him. 
There were always some, usually 
the ones who were new or who did 
not practice each day like Burnface. 
The most fights Burnface had ever 
seen were after the teacher who 
talked fast went to the college with- 
out being beaten. Fights continued 
for many days before a new teacher 
could not be beaten. Shouter loved 
to fight, loved to make the students 
afraid, he was good at that. If he 
killed a student he took his gun, left 
him on the floor, and kept teaching. 
Once they had gone through a 
whole class listening to a boy gur- 
gling in his throat, unable to move 
and unable to die. Another day they 
came to class to find the boy from 
yesterday still there, all stiff, with 
flies covering his chest and the floor 
where blood had spilled out. 

Whenever Shouter killed it 
was the one time he did not teach 
things in the right order. He went 
back to the part about how to kill 
and started over there. He walked 
around the room, sticking the barrel 
of his gun against parts of the stu- 
dents’ bodies, reciting the lesson: 

“If you shoot a boy in the eye, 
he will die; if you shoot a boy in 



34 



GALAXY 



the ear, he will die; if you shoot a 
boy in the mouth, he will die;....” 
Student after student, until he 
finished the lesson. Then he started 
the lesson over again, until he had 
gone around the room. Although it 
frightened the other students, it ex- 
cited Burnface. He dreamt at night 
of going from student to student 
himself, pressing his gun against 
them: 

“If you shoot a boy in the heart, 
he will die. If you shoot a boy in 
the face, he will die, but if you 
miss him in the face he will shoot 
you. If you miss the heart you will 
still be able to kill him if you don’t 
miss the heart by much, because if 
you hurt him near the heart he 
won’t be able to shoot and you can 
shoot him again.” 

Worse than losing a fight was liv- 
ing afterwards, outlawed: 

“A boy without a gun is an out- 
law and is no better than a dog.” 

If someone lived after being shot 
in class or at the stadium, his gun 
was taken away and he was sent out 
of the city to spend his days plant- 
ing crops like a woman, running 
from the city boys who raided his 
fields. Some never made it to where 
the black road crossed high over the 
river. When children saw them 
wounded and without their gun, 
they taunted them with sticks the 
way they taunted the cattle. When 
Burnface went on raids he some- 
times saw their bones along the 
road leading to the outlaws’ lands. 
Although the outlaws had no wo- 



men, their number was added to 
each year, mostly from the stadium, 
for almost all of the other boys 
wanted the girls more than they 
wanted to be teacher. 

Shouter was starting to say the 
part about how to draw the gun, 
and when he was done the class 
would be over. This was the part in 
Burnface’s picture where he shot 
Shouter. 

“Shouter!” 

Burnface was on his feet, his 
hands away from his body. Shouter 
looked over the class with a puzzled 
expression. When he saw Burnface 
he smiled, his hands motionless. 
Burnface slapped his thighs and put 
his hands to the side again. Still 
Shouter only smiled. It had not 
been like this in the picture in his 
mind — 

Again Burnface slapped his thighs 
and put his arms out. 

This time Shouter put his arms 
out also. As he reached his hand to 
his gun he saw Shouter doing the 
same, and every thing seemed to go 
slower than it should. With one 
smooth motion he lifted his gun 
(“Pull it straight up or it might get 
stuck in the belt”), crouched down 
(“If you bend down like this a boy 
cannot shoot you as easy”), and 
brought his hand across the striker 
(“You can pull it back like this, but 
if you hit it with your hand like this, 
it is faster”). 

Burnface saw Shouter turn a little 
towards the side that his shooting 
hand was on and lean back up 



ONLY OUTLAWS AND WOMEN

against the wall, so that his feet 
held him up in a stooped position. 
At the same time he heard a ringing 
sound at the back of the room. 
Then he saw a spot of red appear 
on the side of Shouter’s chest near 
his shooting arm. Burnface was al- 
ready pulling the striker on his gun 
back to shake the shell out and 
reaching down to take another bullet 
from one of the slits in his belt. He 
looked back at Shouter as he was 
pushing the new bullet into the bar- 
rel. From his crouched position 
Shouter was doing the same, but 
slower, and now Burnface smiled. 
This was like one of his pictures. 
As he raised his gun again he saw 
Shouter’s eyes open wide like a boy 
does when he is afraid. He had 
never seen Shouter afraid before. 
This time the red spot came faster 
— in the middle of Shouter’s chest, 
engulfing the dark black hair. He 
slid further down the wall and then 
fell sideways, hitting his head on 
the floor. Burnface was putting 
another bullet into his gun as he 
walked to the front of the room. 
Shouter was not moving. He stuck 
the gun back into his belt, turned to 
the class, and looked from face to 
face. Everyone’s eyes were wide. 

“Iam teacher!” 

No one moved, and some of the 
students looked away. 

“Go!” 

The students rushed for the 
doorway and fought their way out 
of the school. Burnface stared out 
over the empty room for a long 

36 



time and then left. He crossed to 
the teachers' building and pushed 
the door open. It was vacant inside. 
He walked to where the hall turned. 
Down the hall he saw one of the 
teachers standing outside a room. 
He put his hands out to the side 
when he saw Bumface. 

“I am teacher!” 

The teacher kept his hands out to 
the side. 

“Who is dead?” 

“Shouter.” 

The teacher put his hands down 
and pointed back in the direction 
from which he had come. 

“Go up the stairs.” 

He walked back to the door and 
saw the steps going to the second 
floor. At the top of the steps was 
one of Shouter’s women, who fled 
down the hallway and into a room. 
Bumface followed her. The rest of 
Shouter’s women were there. 

“I am teacher!” 

The women backed away from 
him. Bumface, pointed to the small, 
skinny woman: 

“Go!” 

The girl jumped as if struck, and 
crept past Burnface with wide eyes. 
None of them moved, and Bumface 
struggled in his mind to find the 
next words. Then one of the women 
in the back of the room, an older 
girl with heavy legs, pushed her 
way through and came up to 
Bumface. She began combing the 
matted hair on his chest with her 
fingertips as she crooned: 

“Teacher, teacher, teacher!” ★

A STEP 

FARTHER 

OUT 

ON CULTURES BEYOND THE EARTH 



One of my pleasures in life is 
new books on new subjects. Like 
most writers, I love to have written 
but hate to write. I put up with 
these enforced intervals of being 
chained to a typewriter because I 
can make a good living while in- 
dulging myself in an orgy of 
magazines and books; indeed, be- 
cause I am a science fiction writer, 
there is literally nothing I can’t 
show to be relevent to my business, 
and thus I can subscribe to a dozen 
science and technology magazines, 
buy the entire output of the Library 
of Science, take trips to Greece, in- 
duce NASA and JPL and the aero- 
space companies to send me their 
technical reports. 

No, I can't keep up with every- 
thing I should, but I can try, and 
not feel guilty about wasting time, 
and when I lire of reading, I can 
always take long walks with a 
notebook and plot a new novel. (It’s 
not the planning of a book that’s 
onorous work, it’s sitting in this 



damned room with the door closed 
and pounding on this infernal 
machine. .) 

Anyway. I read a lot, and try to 
keep up with what’s important for 
the future; and 1 like it. Now, most 
of what I read is hard science. It 
isn’t that I don’t want to read 
speculative social science; there just 
isn’t much of it, and most of what 
there is is written by my colleagues 
in the sf business. 

Thus it was with great pleasure 
that I found I’d been sent a review 
copy of CULTURES BEYOND 
THE EARTH, subtitled “The Role 
of Anthropology in Outer Space” 
(Random House, 1975, A Vintage 
Paperback Original; $2.95, 203 
pp.). The book is edited by 
Magorah Maruyama and Arthur 
Hawkins, and a word about the 
editors is appropriate. 

Maruyama has a PhD. in 
philosophy and an apparently dis- 
tinguished academic career; he is 
now a professor of systems science 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



37 



at Portland State University. Haw- 
kins has a Ph.D. from Kansas and 
is an associate professor of educa- 
tion and sociology and Director of 
Graduate Studies at the University 
of Minnesota. The book is a collec- 
tion of essays, and generally impres- 
sive academic credentials are given 
for the contributors. The two editors 
have been instrumental in organiz- 
ing “cultural futuristics symposia” 
at meetings of the American An- 
thropological Association. 

In other words, this ought to be 
quite a book. Anthropologists, I am 
told, understand the dynamics of 
human culture. They study the real 
nitty-gritty, the nuts and bolts of 
society. Their speculations should 
not be mere hodge-podges of in- 
compatible detail, but dynamic 
working models. 

Moreover, the senior editor of the 
book is a professor of “systems sci- 
ence." Now I was once a systems 
scientist, at least according to my 
job title in the aerospace industry; 
and there, at least, there is the pre- 
tense if not actuality that systems 
engineers and scientists have some 
elementary knowledge about all the 
disciplines that impinge on their 
work . 

CULTURES BEYOND THE 
EARTH, moreover, is not merely a 
collection of essays: it is a collec- 
tion of prize-winning essays, the 
eight winning and thus presumably 
best essays on the topic of extrater- 
restrial communities submitted to a 
contest open not only to an- 



thropologists, but also to free lance 
writers and “technologists.” The 
best of anthropology, edited by a 
systems scientist; this should be 
speculative social science with 
rivets. I could hardly wait to read 
it. 

* * * 

Alas. The book opens with the 
obligatory essay denouncing poor 
old Western logic. The senior 
editor, Maruyama, says “More 
specifically, [this book] challenges 
the homogenistic, universalistic 
philosophy — the belief in one truth 
and one logic — which is erroneously 
considered to be the basis of ‘scien- 
tific’ thinking but which is now 
proving to be unscientific.” We’ve 
all heard that one before, usually as 
prelude to some slipshod thinking 
the writer was too lazy to tighten 
up. 

Well, all right, though; that kind 
of talk is popular in some quarters, 
and might sell some books. Let’s 
see how this book challenges our 
homogenistic beliefs in one truth. 

Sigh. Do we see anything really 
new? Anything imaginative? No. 
Instead, there are several essays just 
crammed with pontifical tripe. 
There are the standard denunciations 
of the white man’s treatment of the 
Indians, all told in the standard 
way. The non-homogenistic think- 
ing turns out to be one-sided asser- 
tions about everything from Cortez 
to the current dispute over Black 
Mesa (which I’ve visited and I’d bet 



38 



GALAXY 



money the essayist hasn’t) with no 
slightest hint that there may have 
been tragic inevitability in these 
past and present conflicts of culture. 

Well, all right; the anthropologi- 
cal profession, partly because it is 
excluded by treaty from the study of 
advanced technological civilizations, 
partly because most present-day in- 
tellectuals seem to delight in de- 
nouncing rather than understanding 
the modern world, is famous for its 
partiality to primitives. I would 
have thought these prize-winning 
essays might have something new to 
say on the subject, but after all, this 
too may be obligatory. Let’s get to 
the heart of the book. There is an 
essay that presents us with interac- 
tion between an imaginative new 
human extra-terrestrial social order 
and a truly alien society. How can 
I, of all people, resist that? 

This essay, “The Planet Xeno”, 
is by Shirley Ann Varughese, who 
in contrast to the other participants 
has no list of academic degrees, and 
is described as “interested in alter- 
native life styles.” 

She is also interested in alterna- 
tive physics. Her human colony is 
on the planet Xeno, which “re- 
volves around an earth-type sun.” 
Presumably she means a Sol-type; 
no further data are given about 
Xeno’s star. 

There are three planets in this 
system — “plus one planetoid orbit- 
ing in a vertical plane.’’. 
“Xeno’s orbit is slightly elliptical, 
averaging 77.7 million miles from 



their sun.’’. “The period is 
447.7 standard days or 295.68 local 
days.”. “The planet spins hori- 
zontally (as opposed to earth, which 
spins vertically) with poles to the 
east and west.”. “Twice a local 
year, on local days 25.16 and 
273.01, the small planetoid (with a 
diameter of 3,000 miles and an or- 
bit of 77.7 million miles) comes 
within 480,000 miles of the planet 
Xeno. This results in a minor gravi- 
tational flux on the planet. The 
planet Xeno has a diameter of 
11,650 miles. Although this planet 
is larger, it weighs less than earth 
(arbund half as dense as earth, 
suggesting a lack of heavy metals.)” 

OK. Please don’t fall over laugh- 
ing. Let’s go through it patiently. 
This is as good a place as any to 
give a short lesson on elementary 
planetary-system design; and I 
promise to keep the lesson short, 
the math simple, and the equations 
non-essential to the argument. 

In our homogenistic physics, the 
period P, distance from primary (or 
radius) r, and mass M are related by 
the equation, 

-— 5 - = r (equation one) 

47 T 

where G is our old friend the uni- 
versal constant of gravitation and the 
other values are in absolute units. If 
we stick to relative units, we get rid 
of G and the constant; that is, if we 
give the period in Earth years, the 
mass in Solar masses, and the 
radius in Astronomical Units (one 
AU is the average distance from 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



39 



Earth to the Sun, about 93 million 
miles), the equation becomes, 

M P 2 = r 3 . (equation two) 

For Xeno, P = 447.7/365 = 1.2 
years, and r = 77.7/93 = 0.8 AU. 
We plug that in the equation to find 
the mass of Xeno’s sun, and dis- 
cover to our horror 0.4 Solar mass- 
es. Their sun is a wretched red 
dwarf, and can’t even have inhabit- 
able planets. 

Now we look in a table of stellar 
types and find that a star of 0.4 
Solar mass has a surface tempera- 
ture of about 3400°K (5700° for Old 
Sol) and radiates about 0.04 times 
as much energy as the Sun. We 
look in another table and find that 
Venus — which is a bit closer to Sol 
than Xeno is to its sun— receives 
3.78 calories per square centimeter 
per minute. Multiply 3.78 by 0.04 
and we find that Xeno gets 0.15 
cal/cm 2 min, about twice what Jupi- 
ter gets and 1-0% of what Mars re- 
ceives. It’s going to be cold on 
Xeno. 

(All this information and more is 
given in Stephen H. Dole’s HABIT- 
ABLE PLANETS FOR MAN, 
Biaisdell Publishing Co., copyright 
1964 by the RAND Corp. I believe 
there is a later edition than mine. It 
is an excellent source for would-be 
world builders, and very nearly a 
must for any sf writers’ library.) 

Not really. Varughese next tells 
us, with a straight face, that Xeno 
is very hot; in fact, temperatures at 
the equator are above the boiling 
point of water, but tolerable at the 



poles. Of course that’s meaningless, 
since the poles are “horizontal”; in 
fact, there’s no attempt made to 
show the climate effects of that 
enormous axial tilt, so let’s ignore 
it. The atmosphere of Xeno “is 
considered breathable.” It has 40% 
carbon dioxide, 15% oxygen, 38% 
nitrogen, 3% hydrogen, and 3.8% 
trace elements. No pressure figures 
are given. Those who’d like to try 
living in 40% COs are welcome. 

I could go on, buy why bother? 
The physics are silly. There’s noth- 
ing systematic about the design; 
just a jumble of gup thrown to- 
gether to be different from Earth. 
Well, all right; she doesn’t know 
any physics (although one might 
have expected the editors to insist 
on a systematic design), but we’re 
after all interested mainly in the 
human and alien societies. Let’s 
look at the aliens. 

Xeno is “under heavy clouds” 
all the time. Not much light gets to 
the surface; so little that Earthmen’s 
houses need a large window area. 
This, of course affects the aliens: 
their eyes are “large, dark, noctur- 
nal eyes mounted mid-head, which 
are designed to admit as much light 
as possible.” Evidently her non- 
homogenistic truth coincides with 
optical physics; now what do these 
Xenobians, who live in perpetual 
twilight, eat? 

Almost nothing. You see, they 
are plant men. Intelligent, of 
course. They photosynthesize. In 
the daytime they’re active, rushing 



40 



GALAXY 



about building things; at night, 
though, because they have no effi- 
cient energy storage system, Xeno- 
bians become immobile. 

Again I could go on, but why? 
Our author knows no biology either. 
Neither, apparently, does her editor. 
Plants on Earth with its clear at- 
mosphere can’t manage locomotion 
because of energy limits, but plants 
on Xeno in perpetual twilight can. 
Yeah. Sure. 

All right; she knows neither 
physics nor biology, but what of 
sociology? Xeno is a mining com- 
munity set in an extremely hostile 
environment. The mineral product, 
C, is of enormous value to man- 
kind, and the colony has been 
planted by the United World Com- 
mission, which retains ultimate con- 
trol of it. 

The UWC is sexist: to build up 
the population of Xeno, 5 women 
are sent for each man. Well, OK, 
transportation may be terribly ex- 
pensive. But this place must pro- 
duce. “The pressures of C produc- 
tion plus the harshness of the envi- 
ronment produces a spartan society. 
Skipping work assignments results 
in social ostracism or deportation." 
Given the way people have to live 
on Xeno, I’d have said deportation 
was a goal to work for, myself. 

Varughese justifies the 5 to 1 ra- 
tio on grounds that recruiting for 
this terrible place will be very dif- 
ficult; tacitly, in other words, she 
consents to enslavement of those 
born on Xeno. They must work to 



produce this C for the rest of the 
human race. 

Well, that’s been done before; so 
how is Xeno governed? Why, by 
democratic socialism, of course. 
Elected officials. A model constitu- 
tion. And the locally enacted crimi- 
nal code “includes special penalties 
for neglecting work assignments, 
smuggling C, and endangering the 
life of a colonist or of the entire 
colony. Punishment would not be 
severe and the main emphasis 
would be on the prevention and 
cure of crimes.” 

Utopia among the inhabitants of 
Hell. With no incentive whatever, 
these people, not coerced by sol- 
diers or otherwise threatened by the 
kindly UWC, are to work all their 
lives, for generations even, not to 
make their own world pleasant, but 
to produce C for those who don’t 
even work there; and do so while 
establishing a criminal justice sys- 
tem more effective than any so far 
seen on Earth. 

Sure. 

Well, sociology’s not such an 
exact science as physics; possibly 
some rational people will see this 
community as possible. But his- 
tory’s against it. Sure, there are 
ways to get Xeno colonials to sweat 
their tails off for the rest of us, but 
historically that’s required heavy 
emotional appeals, or the prospect 
of great wealth and early retirement, 
or both. None of these is offered 
the Xeno colonist. 

Meanwhile, these colonists are 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



41 



organized into families of 6: 1 man 
and 5 women. “All members of the 
family care for the children. Each 
child receives an equal amount of 
love and care from each one of the 
mothers, whether she is the natural 
mother or not.” 

Now let’s see: has that experi- 
ment been tried? Uh, yeah, in 
harems; the usual result was that 
when the old man died, the mothers 
vied to get their own kid set up as 
chief inheritor. Suleiman the Magni- 
ficent had his favorite son 
bowstringed due to a wife’s in- 
trigues; as a result Selim the Sot 
became Sultan. But this won’t hap- 
pen on Xeno, because we postulate 
that it won’t. Jacob and Esau won’t 
quarrel, and Sarah won’t hate 
Ishmael. 

Again I could go on, but why 
bother? As with the physics, the 
sociology is absurd. Oh, I’m not 
saying that such a social order can't 
work, but I am saying we don’t 
know how to make it work, and 
these anthropologists have given us 
absolutely no nuts and bolts; there’s 
simply a description of what looks 
to me like an extremely unlikely so- 
cial order. And you can find more 
interesting alternate societies in al- 
most any issue of almost any sf 
magazine. 

* * ★ 

I’m sorry I was so rough on Var- 
ughese. It’s not her fault. She sub- 
mitted an essay with a good heart, 
and it’s not her fault that she 



doesn’t know enough physics, biol- 
ogy, anthropology, or sociology to 
make it work. Slush-pile readers for 
sf magazines see worse every day 
from good and gentle people whose 
only fault is having more ambition 
and drive than knowledge. 

But we can and should take to 
task the editors of CULTURES 
BEYOND THE EARTH— and the 
editors at Random House who al- 
lowed this garbage to be printed on 
the bodies of dead trees. How the 
hell can anyone have respect for the 
social sciences and “systems sci- 
ence” after seeing this nonsense 
lauded as a prize- winning essay? 

If that’s what challenging non- 
homogenistic science is all about, 
give me the homogeneous stuff. 

—PART TWO— 

I’m tempted to throw away this 
essay. What have I done but belittle 
a few soft-headed people? I rarely 
review books, and almost never re- 
view a book I didn’t like, so this 
seems a shabby thing to do. Why 
bother? 

1 bother because it’s important. 
There is a crying need for specula- 
tive social science, for an examina- 
tion of the role of anthropology in 
outer space. This book pretends to 
be it, and that’s what makes me an- 
gry: not that it attempts and fails, 
but that it doesn’t attempt at all. It 
merely pretends. 

Look, social science has a hard 
job. Things don’t stand still. There 
aren’t any of those magic equations

that so fascinated me when I read, 
in high school, the Foundation tril- 
ogy and deliberately planned my 
education so I could be the Hari 
Seldon of the XXth Century. Prob- 
ably there won’t ever be; attempts 
to use the methods of the exact 
sciences in the study of man and 
society have failed, often disastrous- 
ly, and a good case can be made 
that they’ll always fail. 

I happen to believe there’s far 
more intuitive understanding of man 
and society in literature than scien- 
tific knowledge about the same; that 
there is “an operation called Vers- 
tehen’’ that escapes the most 
meticulous rat-runner with his Skin- 
ner box in the most scientific of 
psychology departments. But though 
I believe introspection may be more 
valuable than mathematics for un- 
derstanding the nature of man, it 
does not follow that we can discard 
the hard knowledge we have from 
other disciplines. 

When I was in psychology 
graduate school, the physiologists 
were confident that within 20 years 
they’d understand human behavior 
on their terms; biochemistry and 
biophysics would retire psychology 
and sociology. Well, 20 years and 
more have gone by, and the 
physiologists are thrilled when they 
can show a chemical stimulus that 
may cause one ant to follow 
another. They haven’t eliminated 
psychology or history. God forbid 
they ever will. (And in fact He has, 
one suspects.) 



But that most emphatically does 
not mean we can ignore what the 
physiologists have learned! Ye 
gods, many of what we were once 
certain were “functional 
psychoses” — mental disorders 
caused by purely psycho-social 
factors — are now known to be 
chemical poisoning; anyone treating 
those patients with psychotherapy is 
practicing sympathetic magic. 

Similarly, the “anthropologist of 
outer space” simply cannot afford 
ignorance of elementary space 
physics. Because we have good 
reason to reject monistic dogmatic 
“truths” about “human nature” 
does not mean we make a meaning- 
ful contribution to social science by 
praising nonsense as this book does. 

The social scientist has a damned 
hard row to hoe. I gave it up, be- 
cause I do not think I will ever 
make a really significant contribu- 
tion to the social sciences — as a sci- 
entist. I’d have to be too careful. 
As a writer I can speculate, get far 
out, try something really wild. As a 
writer I’m not a professional 
spokesman for a responsible 
academic discipline. My peer re- 
view comes from fans — who will 
gleefully show me the nonsense in 
my writing. 

And yet I am a damned sight 
more careful than these editors 
were. Here a professor of systems 
science and a Director of Graduate 
studies, in a book heavy with 
academic credentialled authors, col- 
laborate to produce a book that falls 



A STEP FARTHER OUT

short of what the average sf editor 
could put together from published 
sf. I guarantee I could assemble a 
better book by writing ten letters to 
selected colleagues. 

These ackdemic bigdomes are 
trampling in both my gardens. 
They’re sowing weeds and saying 
they’re flowers. I invested a good 
part of my life in graduate studies 
in social science. Some of it was a 
waste of time, but I don’t like the 
whole profession made a laughing- 
stock as was done by this book. 

That’s why I’m angry. If these 
gentlemen are representative of their 
profession, the taxpayers ought to 
refuse to support every single de- 
partment of every publicly sup- 
ported university in which this kind 
of garbage is thought useful. If this 
is social science, I don’t object to it 
between consenting adults, but 
don’t make me pay for it. 

If it isn’t representative, some- 
body ought to say so. Me, I’m too 
far from academia to know; but I 
say, reverently, God help the stu- 
dents who come under this kind of 
influence. If you win prizes for this, 
what could flunk you? If professors 
of systems science and directors of 
graduate studies not only don’t 
know where to look up Kepler’s 
Laws, but apparently aren’t even 
aware that such things exist. 

And now comes the worst part. 
Not only is this book touted for its 
academic respectability, but it has 
an introduction of high praise by 
Alvin Toffler. Now I don’t intend 



to review FUTURE SHOCK; only 
Toffler’s comments on CULTURES 
BEYOND THE EARTH. 

First, he singles out for critique 
the fact that “a number of writers 
suggest that the first human colonies 
in space will be launched by a ‘unit- 
ed’ human race in anticipation of, 
or in response to, earthside 
disaster” — a familiar science fiction 
assumption that ought, perhaps, be 
sent into retirement. 

He continues: “Such lapses are 
rare. .what is important is not the 
book’s unevenness but its striking 
originality. No doubt it will be at- 
tacked by pedants and purists. But 
it springs from so innovative an 
idea and is carried out with such in- 
tellectual brio that it should be read 
by anyone seriously interested in an- 
thropology, space, or both.” 

God save us! Can he really mean 
that? And this is the man who is to 
tell us how to survive future shock? 
Whose opinions on every subject 
scientific are meticulously sought 
and endlessly thrust at us by TV 
networks? Whose pronouncements 
about nuclear energy, ecology, the 
oil crisis, and education are given 
us as if graven in stone and handed 
from Sinai? 

But Poumelle, you’re getting up- 
set over nothing. Academicians 
produce lousy books all the time, 
and they get their friends to write 
good blurbs about them every week, 
and so what? 

So this. I’ve read this book, and 
although there are a few coherent 



44 



GALAXY 



essays in it, I defy any moderately 
active sf reader to find one bloody 
thing in there that science fiction 
writers haven’t been saying for 
twenty years. Yet these people take 
a condescending attitude toward sci- 
ence fiction when they notice it at 
all. (Exception: the essay by Donald 
Stern, a University of Washington 
undergraduate who gives a bibliog- 
raphy of sf books and stories on the 
first contact theme.) 

This book abounds with 
platitudinous statements, unstated 
assumptions, unsupported dogma, 
political slogans, all presented as 
high truth. There’s an essay on 
“anomalistics” which presents Vel- 
ikovsky as a “martyr”. (I’ve said 
my piece on Velikovsky, and he 
was shamefully treated by Big Sci- 
ence; but to call a man made weal- 
thy through his books, who has a 
movement of devoted followers, 
who gets paid large fees for his lec- 
tures, a “martyr” seems unduly to 
debase a noble word.) It’s stated 
flatly that goods in a lunar commu- 
nity will be community owned; no 
private property, but never stated 
why. We’re told with a straight face 
that “any cultural entity or part of a 
cultural entity as defined in its own 
terms has the right to accept or re- 
ject, under no duress, temptation, or 
threat, any proposed changes we 
might offer in their life styles or in 
the management of their property.” 
We’re told that we “must accept in 
toto all political, ecological, social, 
religious, scientific, and moral de- 



cisions reached by the members of 
each particular culture.” (And this 
goes not only for aliens we might 
meet, but any sub-cultures who live 
here now. Like the IRA, Stern 
Gang, Orange Defense League, and 
Palestine Liberation Organization, I 
presume.) 

And we’re given all this by a pair 
of editors who see nothing wrong 
with a planet that experiences 
periodic gravitational flux because a 
moon-sized object periodically ap- 
proaches two lunar distances away. 
Look, if the editors demonstrate 
they have never heard of under- 
graduate physics and biology, why 
should we assume they can recog- 
nize great truths about man, or ad- 
vise us on how to treat aliens? 

End of diatribe. Don’t blame this 
column on Jim Baen. One of my 
prerogatives as science editor of 
GALAXY is once in a while to 
write about something that moves 
me strongly, and this book did. 
Next month we’ll go back to my 
brand of speculation. 

Bdt I think somebody had to say 
it, and let me sum up the point of 
this month’s column. All you 
academicians who want to exploit 
the student interest in science fiction 
and space; who want to feel modem 
and up to date; who want to get 
with it by calling yourselves sys- 
tems scientists and pretending to 
know everything; before you pon- 
tificate about the future of man, 
learn as much as the average sf fan 
already knows. Please? ★ 



A STEP FARTHER OUT

You are your own worst 
enemy — and best friend too. 

I do my banking at the Ar- 
chimedes Trust Association. Their 
security is first-rate, their service is 
courteous, and they have their own 
medico facility that does nothing 
but take recordings for their vaults. 

And they had been robbed two 
weeks ago. 

It was a break for me. I had been 
approaching my regular recording 
date and dreading the chunk it 
would take from my savings. Then 
these thieves break into my bank, 
steal a huge amount of negotiable 
paper, and in an excess of en- 
thusiasm they destroy all the record- 
ing cubes. Every last one of them, 
crunched into tiny shards of plastic. 
Of course the bank had to replace 
them all, and very fast, too. They 
weren’t stupid; it wasn’t the first 
time someone had used such a bank 
robbery to facilitate a murder. So 
the bank had to record everyone 
who had an account, and do it in a 
few days. It must have cost them 
more than the robbery. 

How that scheme works, inciden- 
tally, is like this. The robber 
couldn’t care less about the money 
stolen. Mostly it’s very risky to 
pass such loot, anyway. The pro- 
grams written into the money com- 
puters these days are enough to foil 
all but the most exceptional robber. 
You have to let that kind of money 
lie for on the order of a century to 
have any hope of realizing gains on 
it. Not impossible, of course, but 
the police types have found out that 



few criminals are temperamentally 
able to wait that long. The robber’s 
real motive in a case where memory 
cubes have been destroyed is mur- 
der, not robbery. 

Every so often someone comes 
along who must commit a crime of 
passion. There are very few left 
open, and murder is the most awk- 
ward of all. It just doesn’t satisfy 
this type to kill someone and see 
them walking around six months la- 
ter. When the victim sues the killer 
for alienation of personality — and 
collects up to 99%of the killer’s 
worldly goods — it’s just twisting 
the knife. So if you really hate 
someone, the temptation is great to 
really kill them, forever and ever, 
just like in the old days, by destroy- 
ing their memory cube first then kill- 
ing the body. 

That’s what the ATA feared, and 
I had rated a private bodyguard over 
the last week as part of my con- 
tract. It was sort of a status symbol 
to show your friends, but otherwise 
I hadn’t been much impressed until 
I realized that ATA was going to 
pay for my next recording as part of 
their crash program to cover all 
their policy holders. They had con- 
tracted to keep me alive forever, so 
even though I had been scheduled 
for a recording in only three weeks 
they had to pay for this one. The 
courts had rules that a lost or dam- 
aged cube must be replaced with all 
possible speed. 

So I should have been very hap- 
py. I wasn’t, but tried to be brave. 

I was shown into the recording 
room with no delay and told to strip 
and lie on the table. The medico, a 
man who looked like someone I

47 



might have met several decades 
ago, busied himself with his equip- 
ment as I tried to control my breath- 
ing, I was grateful when he 
plugged the computer lead into my oc- 
cipital socket and turned off my 
motor control. Now I didn’t have to 
worry about whether to ask if I 
knew him or not. As I grow older, I 
find that’s more of a problem. 1 
must have met twenty thousand 
people by now and talked to them 
long enough to make an impression. 
It gets confusing. 

He removed the top of my head 
and prepared to take a multiholo 
picture of me, a chemical analog of 
everything I ever saw or thought or 
remembered or just vaguely 
dreamed. It was a blessed relief 
when I slid over into unconscious- 
ness. 

★ * * 

The coolness and sheen of stain- 
less steel beneath my fingertips. 
There is the smell of isopropyl al- 
cohol, and the hint of acetone. 

The medico's shop. Childhood 
memories tumble over me, triggered 
by the smells. Excitement, change, 
my mother standing by while the 
medico carves away my broken 
finger to replace it with a pink new 
one. I lie in the darkness and re- 
member. 

And there is light, a hurting light 
from nowhere and I feel my pupil 
contract as the only movement in 
my entire body. 

“She’s in,” I hear. But I’m not, 
not really. I’m just lying here in the 
blessed dark, unable to move. 

It comes in a rush, the reposses- 
sion of my body. I travel down the 
endless nerves to bang up hard 



against the insides of my hands and 
feet, to whirl through the pools of 
my nipples and tingle in my lips 
and nose. Now I’m in. 

I sat up quickly into the restrain- 
ing arms of the medico. I struggled 
for a second before I was able to re- 
lax. My fingers were buzzing and 
cramped with the clamminess of 
hyperventilation 

“Whew,” 1 said, putting my 
head in my hands. “Bad dream. I 
thought. .” 

I looked around me and saw that 
I was naked on the steel-topped ta- 
ble with several worried faces look- 
ing at me from all sides. I wanted 
to retreat into the darkness again 
and let my insides settle down. I 
saw my mother’s face, blinked, and 
failed to make it disappear. 

“Carnival?” I asked her ghost. 

“Right here, Fox,” she said, and 
took me in her arms. It was awk- 
ward and unsatisfying with her 
standing on the floor and me on the 
table. There were wires trailing 
from my body. But the comfort was 
needed. I didn’t know where I was. 
With a chemical rush as precipitous 
as the one just before I awoke, the 
people solidified around me. 

“She’s all right now,” the 
medico said, turning from his in- 
struments. He smiled impersonally 
at me as he began removing the 
wires from my head. 1 did not smile 
back. I knew where I was now, just 
as surely as I had ever known any- 
thing. I remembered coming in here 
only hours before. 

But I knew it had been more than 
a few hours. I’ve read about it: the 
disorientation when a new body is 
awakened with transplanted 
memories. And my mother wouldn’t 



48 



GALAXY 



be here unless something had gone 
badly wrong. 

I had died. 

I was given a mild sedative, help 
in dressing, and my mother’s arm to 
lead me down plush-carpeted hall- 
ways to the office of the bank pres- 
ident. 1 was still not fully awake. 
The halls were achingly quiet but 
for the brush of our feet across the 
wine-colored rug. I felt like the 

i iressure was fluctuating wildly, 
eaving my ears popped and muf- 
fled. I couldn’t see too far away. 1 
was grateful to leave the vanishing 

E oints in the hall for the panelled 
rowns of wood veneer and the 
coolness and echoes of a white 
marble floor. 

The bank president, Mr, Leander, 
showed us to our seats. I sank into 
the purple velvet and let it wrap 
around me. Leander pulled up a 
chair facing us and offered us 
drinks. 1 declined. My head was 
swimming already and I knew I’d 
have to pay attention. 

Leander fiddled with a dossier on 
his desk. Mine, I imagine. It had 
been freshly printed out from the 
terminal at his right hand. I’d met 
him briefly before; he was a pleas- 
ant sort of person, chosen for this 
public-relations job for his willing- 
ness to wear the sort of old-man 
body that inspires confidence and 
trust. He seemed to be about sixty- 
five. He was probably more like 
twenty. 

It seemed that he was never go- 
ing to get around to the briefing so 
1 asked a question. One that was 
very important to me at the mo- 
ment. 

“What’s the date?” 

“It’s the month of November,” 



he said, ponderously. “And the 
year is 342.” 

I had been dead for two and a 
half years. 

“Listen,” I said, “I don’t want 
to take up any more of your time. 
You must have a brochure you can 
give me to bring me up to date. If 
you’ll just hand it over, I’ll be on 
my way. Oh, and thank you for 
your concern.” 

He waved his hand at me as I 
started to rise. 

“I would appreciate it if you 
stayed a bit longer. Yours is an un- 
usual case, Ms. Fox. I. well, it’s 
never happened in the history of the 
Archimedes Trust Association.” 

“Yes?” 

“You see, you’ve died, as you 
figured out soon after we woke you. 
What you couldn’t have known is 
that you’ve died more than once 
since your last recording.” 

“More than once?” So it wasn’t 
such a smart question; so what was 
I supposed to ask? 

“Three times.” 

“Three?” 

“Yes, three separate time. We 
suspect murder.” 

The room was perfectly silent for 
a while. At last I decided I should 
have that drink. He poured it for 
me, and I drained it. 

“Perhaps your mother should tell 
you more about it,’’ Leander 
suggested. “She’s been closer to 
the situation. 1 was only made 
aware of it recently. Carnival?” 

* * * 

I found my way back to my 
apartment in a sort of daze. By the 
time I had settled in again the drug 



THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS 



49 



was wearing off and I could face 
my situation with a clear head. But 
my skin was crawling. 

Listening in the third person to 
things you’ve done is not the most 
pleasant thing. 1 decided it was time 
to face some facts that all of us, in- 
cluding myself, do not like to think 
about. The first order of business 
was to recognise that the things that 
were done by those three previous 
people were not done by me. I was 
a new person, fourth in the line of 
succession. I had many things in 
common with the previous incarna- 
tions, including all my memories up 
to that day I surrendered myself to 
the memory recording machine. But 
the me of that time and place had 
been killed. 

She lasted longer than the others. 
Almost a year, Carnival had said. 
Then her body was found at the bot- 
tom of Hadley Rille. It was an ap- 
propriate place for her to die; both 
she and myself liked to go hiking 
out on the surface for purposes of 
inspiration. 

Murder was not suspected that 
time. The bank, upon hearing of 
my — no, her — death, started a 
clone from the tissue sample I had 
left with my recording. Six luna- 
tions later, a copy of me was in- 
fused with my memories and told 
that she had just died. She had been 
shaken, but seemed to be adjusting 
well when she, too, was killed. 

This time there was much suspi- 
cion. Not only had she survived for 
less than a lunation after her rein- 
carnation, but the circumstances 
were unusual. She had been blown 
to pieces in a tube-train explosion. 
She had been the only passenger in 
a two-seat capsule. The explosion 



had been caused by a home-made 
bomb. 

There was still the possibility that 
it was a random act, possibly by 
political terrorists. The third copy of 
me had not thought so. I don’t 
know why. That is the most mad- 
dening thing about memory record- 
ing: being unable to profit by the 
experiences of your former selves. 
Each time I was killed, it moved 
me back to square one, the day I 
was recorded. 

But Fox 3 had reason to be 
paranoid. She took extraordinary 
precautions to stay alive. More 
specifically, she tried to prevent cir- 
cumstances that could lead to her 
murder. It worked for five luna- 
tions. She died as the result of a 
fight, that much was certain. It was 
a very violent fight, with blood all 
over the apartment. The police at 
first thought she must have fatally 
injured her attacker, but analysis 
showed all the blood to have come 
from her body. 

So where did that leave me, Fox 
4? An hour’s careful thought left 
the picture gloomy indeed. Con- 
sider: each time my killer succeeded 
in murdering me, he or she learned 
more about me. My killer must be 
an expert on Foxes by now, know- 
ing things about me that I myself 
did not know. Such as how I handle 
myself in a fight. I gritted my teeth 
when I thought of that. Carnival 
told me that Fox 3, the canniest of 
the lot, had taken lessons in self- 
defense. Karate, I think she said. 
Did I have the benefit of it? Of 
course not. If I wanted to defend 
myself 1 had to start all over, be- 
cause those skills died with Fox 3. 

No, all the advantages were with 



50 



GALAXY 



my killer. The killer starts off with 
the advantage of surprise — since I 
had no notion of who it was — and 
in this case learned more about me 
every time he or she succeeded in 
killing me. 

What to do? I didn’t even know 
where to start. 1 ran through 
everyone I knew, looking for an 
enemy, someone who hated me 
enough to kill me again and again. I 
could find no one. Most likely it 
was someone Fox 1 had met during 
that year she lived after the recording. 

The, only answer I could come up 
with was emigration. Just pull up 
stakes and go to Mercury, or Mars, 
or even Pluto. But would that 
guarantee my safety? My killer 
seemed to be an uncommonly per- 
sistent person. No, I'd have to face 
it here, where at least I knew the 
turf. 

* * * 

It was the next day before I 
realized the extent of my loss. I had 
been robbed of an entire symphony. 

For the last thirty years I had 
been an Environmentalist. I had just 
drifted into it while it was still an 
infant art-form. I had been in 
charge of the weather machines at 
the Transvaal disneyland, which 
was new at the time and the biggest 
and most modern of all the en- 
vironmental parks in Luna. A few 
of us had started tinkering with the 
weather programs, first for our own 
amusement. Later we invited friends 
to watch the storms and sunsets we 
concocted. Before we knew it, 
friends were inviting friends and the 
Transvaal people began selling tick- 
ets. 



I gradually made a name for my- 
self, and found I could make more 
money being an artist than being an 
engineer. At the time of my last re- 
cording 1 had been one of the top 
three Environmentalists on Luna. 

Then Fox 1 went on to compose 
Liquid Ice. From what I read in the 
reviews, two years after the fact, it 
was seen as the high point of the art 
to date. It had been staged in the 
Pennsylvania disneyland, before a 
crowd of three hundred thousand. It 
made me rich. 

The money was still in my bank 
account, but the memory of creating 
it was forever lost. And it mattered. 

Fox 1 had written it, from begin- 
ning to end. Oh, I recalled having had 
some vague ideas of a winter com- 
position, things I’d think about later 
and put together. But the whole 
creative process had gone on in the 
head of that other person who had 
been killed. 

How is a person supposed to 
cope with that? For one bitter mo- 
ment I considered calling the bank 
and having them destroy my mem- 
ory cube. If I died this time. I’d 
rather die completely. The thought 
of a Fox 5 rising from that table. 
it was almost too much to bear. She 
would lack everything that Fox I, 
2, 3, and me, Fox 4, had experi- 
enced. So far I’d had little time to 
add to the personality we all shared, 
but even the bad times are worth 
saving. 

It was either that, or have a new 
recording made every day. 1 called 
the bank, did some figuring, and 
found that I wasn't wealthy enough 
to afford that. But it was worth 
exploring. If I had a new recording 
taken once a week I could keep at it 



THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS 



51 



for about a year before I ran out of 
money. 

I decided I’d do it, for as long as 
I could. And to make sure that no 
future Fox would ever have to go 
through this again, I’d have one 
made today. Fox 5, if she was ever 
born, woGld be born knowing at 
least as much as I knew now. 

★ ★ ★ 

I felt better after the recording 
was made. I found that I no longer 
feared the medico’s office. That 
fear comes from the common mis- 
apprehension that one will wake up 
from the recording to discover that 
one has died. It’s a silly thing to be- 
lieve, but it comes from the distaste 
we all have for really looking at the 
facts. 

If you’ll consider human con- 
sciousness, you’ll see that the 
three-dimensional cross-section of a 
human being that is you can only 
rise from that table and go about 
your business. It can happen no 
other way. Human consciousness is 
linear, along a timeline that has a 
beginning and an end. If you die af- 
ter a recording, you die, forever and 
with ho reprieve. It doesn’t matter 
that a recording of you exists and 
that a new person with your 
memories to a certain point can be 
created; you are dead. Looked at 
from a fourth-dimensional view- 
point, what memory recording does 
is to graft a new person onto your 
lifeline at a point in the past. You 
do not retrace that lifeline and mag- 
ically become that new person. I, 
Fox 4, was only a relative of that 
long-ago person who had her 
memories recorded. And if I died it 



was forever. Fox 5 would awaken 
with my memories to date, but I 
would be no part of her. She would 
be on her own. 

Why do we do it? I honestly 
don’t know. I suppose that the hu- 
man urge to live forever is so strong 
that we’ll grasp at even the most 
unsatisfactory substitute. At one 
time people had themselves frozen 
when they died, in the hope of be- 
ing thawed out in a future when 
humans knew how to reverse death. 
Look at the Great Pyramid in the 
Egypt disneyland if you want to see 
the sheer size of that urge. 

So we live our lives in pieces. I 
could know, for whatever good it 
would do me, that thousands of 
years from now a being would still 
exist who would be at least partly 
me. She would remember exactly 
the same things I remembered of 
her childhood; the trip to Ar- 
chimedes, her first sex change, her 
lovers, her hurts and her happiness. 
If I had another recording taken, 
she would remember thinking the 
thoughts I was thinking now. And 
she would probably still be stringing 
chunks of experience onto her life, 
year by year. Each time she had a 
new recording that much more of 
her life was safe for all time. There 
was a certain comfort in knowing 
that my life was safe up until a few 
hours ago, when the recording was 
made. 

Having thought all that out, I 
found myself fiercely determined to 
never let it happen again. I began to 
hate my killer with an intensity I 
had never experienced. I wanted to 
storm out of the apartment and beat 
my killer to death with a blunt in- 
strument.

I swallowed that emotion with 
difficulty. It was exactly what the 
killer would be looking for. I had to 
remember that the killer knew what 
my first reaction would be. I had to 
behave in a way that he or she 
would not expect. 

But what way was that? 

I called up the police department 
and talked to the detective who had 
my case. Her name was Isadora, 
and she had some good advice. 

“You’re not going to like it, if I 
can judge from past experience,” 
she said. “The last time I proposed 
it to you, you rejected it out of 
hand.” 

I knew I’d have to get used to 
this. People would always be telling 
me what I had done, what I had 
said to them. I controlled my anger 
and asked her to go on. 

“It’s simply to stay put. I know 
you think you’re a detective, but 
your successor proved pretty well 
that you are not. If you stir out of 
that door you’ll be nailed. This guy 
knows you inside and out, and he’ll 
get you. Count on it.” 

“He? You know something about 
him, then?” 

“Sorry, you’ll have to bear with 
me. I’ve told you parts of this case 
twice already, so it’s hard to re- 
member what you don’t know. Yes, 
we do know he’s a male. Or was, 
six months ago, when you had your 
big fight with him. Several witness- 
es reported a man with blood- 
stained clothes, who could only 
have been your killer.” 

“Then you’re on his trail?” 

She sighed, and I knew she was 
going over old ground again. 

“No, and you’ve proved again 
that you’re not a detective. Your de- 



tective lore comes from reading old 
novels. It’s not a glamorous enough 
job nowadays to rate fictional heros 
and such, so most people don’t 
know the kind of work we do. 
Knowing that the killer was a man 
when he last knocked you off 
means nothing to us. He could have 
bought a Change the very next day. 
You’re probably wondering if we 
have fingerprints of him, right?” 

I gritted my teeth. Everyone had 
the advantage over me. It was obvi- 
ous I had asked something like that 
the last time I spoke with this wo- 
man. And 1 had been thinking of it. 

“No,” I said. “Because he could 
change those as easily as his sex, 
right?” 

“Right. Easier. The only positive 
means of identification today is 
genotyping, and he wasn’t coopera- 
tive enough to leave any of him be- 
hind when he killed you. He must 
have been a real brute, to be able to 
inflict as much damage on you as 
he did and not even be cut himself. 
You were armed with a knife. Not a 
drop of his blood was found at the 
scene of the murder.” 

“Then how do you go about find- 
ing him?” 

‘‘Fox, I’d have to take you 
through several college courses to 
begin to explain our methods to 
you. And I’ll even admit that 
they’re not very good. Police work 
has not kept up with science over 
the last century. There are many 
things available to the modem crim- 
inal that make our job more difficult 
than you’d imagine. We have hopes 
of catching him within about four 
lunations, though, if you’ll stay put 
and stop chasing him.” 

“Why four months?” 



THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS 



53 



“We trace him by computer. We 
have very exacting programs that 
we run when we’re after a guy like 
this. It’s our one major weapon. 
Given time, we can run to ground 
about sixty percent of the crimi- 
nals.’’ 

“Sixty percent?’’ I squawked. 
“Is that supposed to encourage me? 
Especially when you’re dealing with 
a master like my killer seems to 
be?” 

She shook her head. “He’s not a 
master. He’s only determined. And 
that works against him, not for him. 
The more single-mindedly he pur- 
sues you, the surer we are of catch- 
ing him when he makes a slip. That 
sixty percent figure is over-all 
crime; on murder, the rate is 
ninety-eight. It’s a crime of passion, 
usually done by an amateur. The 
pros see no percentage in it, and 
they’re right. The penalty is so 
steep it can make a pauper of you, 
and your victim is back on the 
streets while you’re still in court.” 

I thought that over, and found it 
made me feel better. My killer was 
not a criminal mastermind. I was 
not being hunted by Fu-Manchu or 
Dr. Moriarty. He was only a person 
like myself, new to this business. 
Something Fox 1 did had made him 
sufficiently angry to risk financial 
ruin to stalk and kill me. It scaled 
him down to human dimensions. 

“So now you’re all ready to go 
out and get him?” Isadora sneered. 
I guess my thoughts were written on 
my face. That, or she was consult- 
ing her script of our previous con- 
versation. 

“Why not?” I asked. 

“Because, like I said, he’ll get 
you. He might not be a pro but he’s 

54 



an expert on you. He knows how 
you’ll jump. One thing he thinks he 
knows is that you won’t take my 
advice. He might be right outside 
your door, waiting for you to finish 
this conversation like you did last 
time around. The last time, he 
wasn’t there. This time he might 
be.” 

It sobered me. I glanced ner- 
vously at my door, which was 
guarded by eight different security 
systems bought by Fox 3. 

“Maybe you’re right. So you 
want me just to stay here. For how 
long?’ ’ 

“However long it takes. It may 
be a year. That four-lunation figure 
is the high point on a computer 
curve. It tapers off to a virtual cer- 
tainty in just over a year.” 

“Why didn’t I stay here the last 
time?” 

“A combination of foolish brav- 
ery, hatred, and a fear of bore- 
dom.” She searched my eyes, try- 
ing to find the words that would 
make me take the advice that Fox 3 
had fatally refused. “I understand 
you’re an artist,’’ she went on. 
“Why can’t you just. well, 
whatever it is artists do when 
they’re thinking up a new composi- 
tion? Can’t you work there in your 
apartment?” 

How could I tell her that inspira- 
tion wasn’t just something I could 
tum on at will? Weather sculpture is 
a tenuous discipline. The visualiza- 
tion is difficult; you can’t just try 
out a new idea like you can with a 
song, by picking it out on a piano 
or guitar. You can run a computer 
simulation, but you never really 
know what you have until the tapes 
are run into the machines and you 



GALAXY 



stand out there in the open field and 
watch the storm take shape around 
you. And you don’t get any practice 
sessions. It’s expensive. 

I’ve always needed long walks on 
the surface. My competitors can’t 
understand why. They go for strolls 
through the various parks, usually 
the one where the piece will be per- 
formed. I do that, too. You have to, 
to get the lay of the land. A compu- 
ter can tell you what it looks like in 
terms of thermoclines and updrafts 
and pocket-ecologies, but you have 
to really go there and feel the land, 
taste the air, smell the trees, before 
you can compose a storm or even a 
summer shower. It has to be a part 
of the land. 

But my inspiration comes from 
the dry, cold, airless surface that so 
few Lunarians really like. I’m not a 
burro wer; I’ve never loved the cor- 
ridors like so many of my friends 
profess to do. I think I see the black 
sky and harsh terrain as a blank 
canvas, a feeling I never really get 
in the disneylands where the land is 
lush and varied and there’s always 
some weather in progress even if 
it’s only partly cloudy and warm. 

Could I compose without those 
long, solitary walks? 

Run that through again: could I 
afford not to? 

“All right, I’ll stay inside like a 
good girl.” 

* * * 

I was in luck. What could have 
been an endless purgatory turned 
into creative frenzy such as I had 
never experienced. My frustrations 
at being locked into my apartment 
translated themselves into grand 



sweeps of tornados and thun- 
derheads. I began writing my mas- 
terpiece. The working title was A 
Conflagration of Cyclones. That’s 
how angry I was. My agent later 
talked me into shortening it to a 
tasteful Cyclone, but it was always 
a conflagration to me. 

Soon I had managed to virtually 
forget about my killer. I never did 
completely; after all, I needed the 
thought of him to flog me onward, 
to serve as the canvas on which to 
paint my hatred. I did have one aw- 
ful thought, early on, and 1 brought 
it up to Isadora. 

“It strikes me,” I said, “that 
what you’ve built here is the better 
mousetrap, and I’m the hunk of 
cheese.” 

“You’ve got the essence of it,” 
she agreed. 

“I find I don’t care for the role 
of bait.” 

“Why not? Are you scared?” 

I hesitated, but what the hell did 
I have to be ashamed of? 

“Yeah. I guess I am. What can 
you tell me to make me stay here 
when I could be doing what all my 
instincts are telling me to do, which 
is run like hell?” 

“That’s a fair question. This is 
the ideal situation, as far as the 
police are concerned. We have the 
victim in a place that can be 
watched, perfectly safely, and we 
have the killer on the loose. Fur- 
thermore, this is an obsessed killer, 
one who cannot stay away from you 
forever. Long before he is able to 
make a strike at you we should pick 
him up as he scouts out ways to 
reach you.” 

“Are there ways?” 

“No. An unqualified no. Any 



THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS 



55 



one of those devices on your door 
would be enough to keep him out. 
Beyond that, your food and water is 
being tested before it gets to you. 
Those are extremely remote pos- 
sibilities since we’re convinced that 
your killer wishes to dispose of 
your body completely, to kill you 
for good. Poisoning is no good to 
him. We’d just start you up again. 
But if we can’t find at least a piece 
of your body, the law forbids us to 
revive you.” 

“What about bombs?” 

“The corridor outside your 
apartment is being watched. It 
would take quite a large bomb to 
blow out your door, and getting a 
bomb that size in place would not 
be possible in the time he would 
have. Relax, Fox. We’ve thought of 
everything. You’re safe.” 

She rung off, and I called up the 
Central Computer. 

“CC,” I said, to get it on-line, 
“can you tell me how you go about 
catching killers?” 

“Are you talking about killers in 
general, or the one you have a par- 
ticular interest in?” 

“What do you think? I don’t 
completely believe that detective. 
What I want to know from you is 
what can I do to help?” 

“There is little you can do,” the 
CC said. “White I myself, in the 
sense of the Central or controling 
Lunar Computer, do not handle the 
apprehension of criminals, I am in a 
supervisory capacity to several satel- 
lite computers. They use a complex 
number theory, correlated with the 
daily input from all my terminals. 
The average person on Luna deals 
with me on the order of twenty 
times per day, many of these trans- 



actions involving a routine epider- 
mal sample for positive genalysis. 
By matching these transactions with 
the time and place they occurred, I 
am able to construct a dynamic 
model of what has occurred, what 
possibly could have occurred, and 
what cannot have occurred. With 
suitable peripheral programs I can 
refine this model to a close degree 
of accuracy. For instance, at the 
time of your first murder I was able 
to assign a low probability to 
ninety-nine point nine three percent 
of all humans on Luna as being re- 
sponsible. This left me with a pool 
of 210,000 people who might have 
had a hand in it. This is merely 
from data placing each person at a 
particular place at a particular time. 
Further weighting of such factors as 
possible motive narrowed the range 
of prime suspects. Do you wish me 
to go on?” 

“No, I think I get the picture. 
Each time I was killed you must 
have narrowed it more. How many 
suspects are left?” 

“You are not phrasing the ques- 
tion correctly. As implied in my 
original statement, all residents of 
Luna are still suspects. But each has 
been assigned a probability, ranging 
from a very large group with a 
value of 10" 27 to twenty individuals 
with probabilities of 13%.” 

The more I thought about that, 
the less 1 liked it. 

“None of those sound to me like 
what you’d call a prime suspect.” 
“Alas, no. This is a very intrigu- 
ing case, I must say.” 

“I’m glad you think so.” 

“Yes,” it said, oblivious as usual 
to sarcasm. “I may have to have 
some programs re-written. We’ve 



56 



GALAXY 



never gone this far without being 
able to submit a ninety percent rat- 
ing to the Grand jury Data Bank.” 
‘‘Then Isadora is feeding me a 
line, right? She doesn’t have any- 
thing to go on?” 

‘‘Not strictly true. She has an 
analysis, a curve, that places the 
probability of capture as near- 
certainty within one year.” 

‘‘You gave her that estimate, 
didn’t you?” 

“Of course.” 

‘ ‘Then what the hell does she do? 
Listen, I’ll tell you right now, I 
don’t feel good about putting my 
fate in her hands. I think this job of 
detective is just a trumped-up feath- 
erbed. Isn’t that right?” 

“The privacy laws forbid me 
to express an opinion about the 
worth, performance, or intelligence 
of a human citizen. But I can give 
you a comparison. Would you en- 
trust the construction of your sym- 
phonies to a computer alone? 
Would you sign your name to a 
work that was generated entirely by 
me?” 

“I see your point.” 

“Exactly. Without a computer 
you’d never calculate all the factors 
you need for a symphony. But / do 
not write them. It is your creative 
spark that makes the wheels turn. 
Incidentally, I told your successor 
but of course you don’t remember 
it, I liked your Liquid Ice tremen- 
dously. It was a real pleasure to 
work with you on it.” 

“Thanks. I wish I could say the 
same.” I signed off, feeling no bet- 
ter than when I began the interface. 

The mention of Liquid Ice had 
me seething again. Robbed! Vio- 
lated! I’d rather have been gang- 



raped by chimpanzees than have the 
memory stolen from me. I had 
punched up the films of Liquid Ice 
and they were beautiful. Stunning, 
and I could say it without conceit 
because I had not written it. 

* * * 

My life became very simple. I 
worked — twelve and fourteen hours 
a day sometimes — ate, slept, and 
worked some more. Twice a day I 
put in one hour learning to fight 
over the holovision. It was all 
highly theoretical, of course, but it 
had value. It kept me in shape and 
gave me a sense of confidence. 

For the first time in my life I got 
a good look at what my body would 
have been with no tampering. I was 
bom female, but Carnival wanted to 
raise me as a boy so she had me 
Changed when I was two hours old. 
It’s another of the contradictions in 
her that used to infuriate me so 
much but which, as I got older, I 
came to love. I mean, why go to all 
the pain and trouble of bringing a 
child to term and giving birth natur- 
ally, all from a professed dislike of 
tampering — and then turn around 
and refuse to accept the results of 
nature’s lottery? I have decided that 
it’s a result of her age. She’s almost 
two hundred by now, which puts 
her childhood back in the days be- 
for Changing. In those days — I’ve 
never understood why — there was a 
predilection for male children. I 
think she never really shed it. 

At any rate, I spent my childhood 
male. When I got my first Change, 
I picked my own body design. 
Now, in a six-lunation-old clone 
body which naturally reflected my 



THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS 



57 



actual genetic structure, I was 
pleased to see that my first female 
body design had not been far from 
the truth. 

I was short, with small breasts 
and an undistinguished body. But 
my face was nice. Cute, I would 
say. I liked the nose. The age of the 
accelerated clone body was about 
seventeen years; perhaps the nose 
would lose its upturn in a few years 
of natural growth, but I hoped not. 
If it did, I’d have it put back. 

Once a week, I had a recording 
made. It was the only time I saw 
people in the flesh. Carnival, Lean- 
der, Isadora, and a medico would 
enter and stay for a while after it 
was made. It took them an hour 
each way to get past the security 
devices. I admit it made me feel a 
little more secure to see how long it 
took even my friends to get in my 
apartment. It was like an invisible 
fortress outside my door. The better 
to lure you into my parlor, killer! 

I worked with the CC as I never 
had before. We wrote new pro- 
grams that produced four-dimensional 
models in my viewer unlike any- 
thing we had ever done before. The 
CC knew the stage — which was to 
be the Kansas disneyland — and I 
knew the storm. Since I couldn’t 
walk on the stage this time before 
the concert I had to rely on the CC 
to reconstruct it for me in the holo 
tank . 

Nothing makes me feel more god- 
like. Even watching it in the 
three-meter tank I felt thirty meters 
tall with lightning in my hair and a 
crown of shimmering frost. I 
walked through the Kansas autumn, 
the brown, rolling, featureless 
prairie before the red or white man 

58 



came. It was the way the real Kan- 
sas looked now under the rule of 
the Invaders, who had ripped up the 
barbed wire, smoothed over the fur- 
rows, dismantled the cities and rail- 
roads and let the buffalo roam once 
more. 

There was a logistical problem I 
had never faced before. I intended 
to use the buffalo instead of having 
them kept out of the way. I needed 
the thundering hooves of a stam- 
pede; it was very much a part of the 
environment I was creating. How to 
do it without killing animals? 

The disneyland management 
wouldn’t allow any of their live- 
stock to be injured as part of a per- 
formance. That was fine with me; 
my stomach turned at the very 
thought. Art is one thing, but life is 
another and I will not kill unless to 
save myself. But the Kansas disney- 
land has two million head of buffalo 
and I envisioned up to twenty-five 
twisters at one time. How do you 
keep the two separate? 

With subtlety, I found. The CC 
had buffalo behavioral profiles that 
were very reliable. The damn CC 
stores everything, and I’ve had oc- 
casion more than once to be thank- 
ful for it. We could position the 
herds at a selected spot and let the 
twisters loose above them. The tor- 
nados would never be totally under 
our control, they are capricious 
even when hand-made, but we 
could rely on a hard ninety percent 
accuracy in steering them. The 
herd-profile we worked up was us- 
able out to two decimal points, and 
as insurance against the unforeseen 
we installed several groups of 
flash-bombs to turn the herd if it 
headed into danger. 



GALAXY 



It’s an endless series of details. 
Where does the lightning strike, for 
instance? On a flat, gently rolling 
plain, the natural accumulation of 
electric charge can be just about 
anywhere. We had to be sure we 
could shape it the way we wanted, 
by burying five hundred ac- 
cumulators that could trigger an 
air-to-ground flash on cue. And to 
the right spot. The air-to-air are 
harder. And the ball lightning — oh, 
brother. But we found we could 
guide it pretty well with buried 
wires carrying an electric current. 
There were going to be range 
fires — so check with the manage- 
ment on places that are due for a 
controlled bum anyway, and keep 
the buffalo away from there, too, 
and be sure the smoke would not 
blow over into the audience and 
spoil the view or into the herd and 
panic them. 

But it was going to be glorious. 

★ ★ * 

Six lunations rolled by. Six luna- 
tions ! 177.18353 mean solar days! 

I discovered that figure during a 
long period of brooding when I 
called up all sorts of data on the in- 
vestigation. Which, according to 
Isadora, was going well. 

1 knew better. The CC has its 
faults but shading data is not one of 
them. Ask it what the figures are 
and it prints them out in tri-color. 

Here’s some: probability of a cap- 
ture by the original curve, ninety- 
three percent. Total number of via- 
ble suspects remaining: nine. High- 
est probability of those nine possi- 
bles: three point nine percent. That 
was Carnival. The others were also 



close friends, and were there solely 
on the basis of having the opportu- 
nity at all three murders. Even Isa- 
dora dared not speculate — at least 
not aloud, and to me — that any of 
them could have a motive. 

I discussed it with the CC. 

“I know. Fox, I know,” it re- 
plied, with the closest approach to 
mechanical despair I have ever 
heard. 

“Is that all you can say?” 

“No. As it happens, I’m pursu- 
ing the other possibility: that it was 
a ghost who killed you.” 

“Are you serious?” 

“Yes. The term ‘ghost’ covers all 
illegal beings. I estimate there to be 
on the order of two hundred of 
them existing outside legal sanctions 
on Luna. These are executed crimi- 
nals with their right to life officially 
revoked, unauthorized children 
never registered, and some sus- 
pected artificial mutants. Those last 
are the result of proscribed experi- 
ments with human DNA. All these 
conditions are hard to conceal for 
any length of time, and I round up 
a few every year.” 

“What do you do with them?” 
“They have no right to life. I 
must execute them when I find 
them.” 

“You do it? That’s not just a fig- 
ure of speech?” 

“That’s right. I do it. It’s a job 
humans find distasteful. I never 
could keep the position filled, so I 
assumed it myself.” 

That didn’t sit right with me. 
There is an atavistic streak in me 
•that doesn't like to turn over the 
complete functioning of society to 
machines. I get it from my mother, 
who goes for years at a time not 



THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS 



59 



deigning to speak to the CC. 

“So you think someone like that 
may be after me. Why?” 

“There is insufficient data for a 
meaningful answer. ‘Why’ has al- 
ways been a tough question for me. 
I can operate only on the parameters 
fed into me when I’m dealing with 
human motivation, and I suspect 
that the parameters are not com- 
plete. I’m constantly being sur- 
prised.” 

“Thank goodness for that.” But 
this time, 1 could have wished the 
CC knew a little more about human 
behavior. 

So I was being hunted by a 
spook. It didn’t do anything for my 
peace of mind. I tried to think of 
how such a person could exist in 
this card-file world we live in. A 
technological rat, smarter than the 
computers, able to fit into the 
cracks and holes in the integrated 
circuits. Where were those cracks? I 
couldn’t find them. When I thought 
of the checks and safeguards all 
around us, the voluntary genalysis 
we submit to every time we spend 
money or take a tube or close a busi- 
ness deal or interface with the 
computer. People used to sign 
their names many times a day, or so 
I’ve heard. Now, we scrape off a 
bit of dead skin from our palms. 
It’s damn hard to fake. 

But how do you catch a phan- 
tom? I was facing life as a recluse 
if this murderer was really so de- 
termined that I die. 

That conclusion came at a bad 
time. I had finished Cyclone, and to 
relax 1 had called up the films of 
some of the other performances dur- 
ing my absence from the art scene. 
I never should have done that. 



Flashiness was out. Understated 
elegance was in. One of the reviews 
I read was very flattering to my 
Liquid Ice. I quote: 

“In this piece Fox has closed the 
book on the blood and thunder 
school of Environmentalism. This 
powerful statement sums up the 
things that can be achieved by sheer 
magnitude and overwhelming dra- 
ma. The displays of the future will 
be concerned with the gentle nuance 
of dusk, the elusive breath of a 
summer breeze. Fox is the 
Tchaikovsky of Environmentalism, 
the last great romantic who paints 
on a broad canvas. Whether she can 
adjust to the new, more thoughtful 
styles that are evolving in the work 
of Janus, or Pym, or even some of 
the ambiguous abstractions we have 
seen from Tyleber, remains to be 
seen. Nothing will detract from the 
sublime glory of Liquid Ice, of 
course, but the time is here. ” 
and so forth and thank you for noth- 
ing. 

For an awful moment I thought I 
had a beautiful dinosaur on my 
hands. It can happen, and the 
hazards are pronounced after a rein- 
carnation. Advancing technology, 
fashion, frontiers, taste, or morals 
can make the best of us obsolete 
overnight. Was everyone con- 
templating gentle springtimes now, 
after my long sleep? Were the 
cool, sweet zephyrs of a summer’s 
night the only thing that had mean- 
ing now? 

A panicky call to my agent dis- 
pelled that quickly enough. As usu- 
al, the pronouncements of the critics 
had gone ahead of the public taste. 
I’m not knocking critics; that’s their 
function, if you concede they have

a function, to chart a course into 
unexplored territory. They must stay 
at the leading edge of the innovative 
artistic evolution, they must see 
what everyone will be seeing in a 
few year’s time. Meanwhile, the 
public was still eating up the type 
of superspectacle 1 have always 
specialized in. I ran the risk of be- 
ing labeled a dinosaur myself, but I 
found the prospect did not worry 
me. I became an artist through the 
back door, just like the tinkerers. in 
early twentieth-century Hollywood 
had done. Before I was discovered, 
I had just been an environmental 
engineer having a good time. 

That’s not to say I don’t take my 
art seriously. I do sweat over it, in- 
vesting inspiration and perspiration 
in about the classic Edison propor- 
tions. But I don’t take the critics 
too seriously, especially when 
they’re not enunciating the public 
taste. Just because Beethoven 
doesn’t sound like currently popular 
art doesn’t mean his music is worth- 
less. 

I found myself thinking back to 
the times before Environmentalism 
made such a splash. Back then we 
were carefree. We had grandiose 
bull-sessions, talking of what we 
would do if only we were given an 
environment large enough. We 
spent months roughing out the pro- 
grams for something to be called 
Typhoon ! It was a hurricane in a 
bottle, and the bottle would have to 
be five hundred kilometers wide. 
Such a bottle still does not exist, 
but when it’s built some fool will 
stage it. Maybe me. The good old 
days never die, you know. 

So my agent made a deal with 
the owner of the Kansas disneyland. 



The owner had known that I was 
working on something for his place, 
but I’d not talked to him about it. 
The terms were generous. My agent 
displayed the profit report on Liquid 
Ice, which was still playing yearly 
to packed houses in Pennsylvania. I 
got a straight fifty percent of the 
gate, with costs of the installation 
and computer time to be shared be- 
tween us. I stood to make about 
five million Lunar Marks. 

And I was robbed again. Not 
killed this time, but robbed of the 
chance to go into Kansas and 
supervise the installation of the 
equipment. I clashed mightily with 
Isadora and would have stormed out 
on my own, armed with nothing so 
much as a nail file, if not for a 
pleading visit from Carnival. So I 
backed down this once and sat at 
home, going there only by holo- 
graphic projection. I plunged into 
self-doubts. After all, 1 hadn’t even 
felt the Kansas sod beneath my bare 
feet this time. I hadn’t been there in 
the flesh for over three years. My 
usual method before I even con- 
ceive a project is to spend a week 
or two just wandering naked 
through the park, getting the feel of 
it through my skin and nose and 
those senses that don’t even have a 
name. 

It took the CC three hours of gen- 
tle argument to convince me again 
that the models we had written were 
accurate to seven decimal places. 
They were perfect. An action or- 
dered up on the computer model 
would be a perfect analog of the 
real action in Kansas. The CC said 
I could make quite a bit of money 
just renting the software to other ar- 
tists. 



THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS

* * * 

The day of the premiere of Cy- 
clone found me still in my apart- 
ment. But J was on the way out. 

Small as I am, I somehow man- 
aged to struggle out that door with 
Carnival, Isadora, Leander, and my 
agent pulling on my elbows. 

I was not going to watch the per- 
formance on the tube. 

I arrived early, surrounded by my 
impromptu bodyguard. The sky 
matched my mind; gray, overcast, 
and slightly fearful. It brooded over 
us, and I felt more and more like a 
sacrificial lamb mounting some 
somber altar. But it was a magnifi- 
cent stage to die upon. 

The Kansas disneyland is one of 
the newer ones, and one of the 
largest. It is a hollowed-out cylinder 
twenty kilometers, beneath Clavius. 
It measures two hundred and fifty 
kilometers in diameter and is five 
kilometers high. The rim is artfully 
disguised to blend into the blue sky. 
When you are half a kilometer from 
the rim, the illusion fails; otherwise, 
you might as well be standing back 
on Old Earth. The curvature of the 
floor is consistent with Old Earth, 
so the horizon is terrifyingly far 
away. Only the gravity is Lunar. 

Kansas was built after most of 
the more spectacular possibilities 
had been exhausted, either on Luna 
or another planet. There was 
Kenya, beneath Mare Moscoviense; 
Himalya, also on the Farside; Ama- 
zon, under old Tycho; Pennsyl- 
vania, Sahara, Pacific, Mekong, 
Transylvania. There were thirty dis- 
neylands under the inhabited planets 



and satellites of the solar system the 
last time I counted. 

Kansas is certainly the least in- 
teresting topographically. It’s flat, 
almost monotonous. But it was per- 
fect for what I wanted to do. What 
artist really chooses to paint on a 
canvas that’s already been covered 
with pictures? Well, I have, for 
one. But for the frame of mind I 
was in when I wrote Cyclone it had 
to be the starkness of the wide-open 
sky and the browns and yellows of 
the rolling terrain. It was the place 
where Dorothy departed for Oz. 
The home of the black twister. 

I was greeted warmly by Pym 
and Janus, old friends here to see 
what the grand master was up to. 
Or so I flattered myself. More 
likely they were here to see the old 
lady make a fool of herself. Very 
few others were able to get close to 
me. My shield of high shoulders 
was very effective. It wouldn’t do 
when the show began, however. I 
wished I was a little taller, then 
wondered if that would make me a 
better target. 

The viewing area was a gentle 
rise about a kilometer in radius. It 
had been written out of the program 
to the extent that none of the more 
fearsome effects would intrude to 
sweep us all into the Land of Oz. 
But being a spectator at a weather- 
show can be grueling. Most had 
come prepared with clear plastic 
slicker, and insulated coat, and 
boots. I was going to be banging 
some warm and some very cold air 
masses head-on to get things roll- 
ing, and some of it would sweep 
over us. There were a few brave 
souls in Native-American warpaint, 
feathers, and mocassins.

An Environmental happening has 
no opening chords like a musical 
symphony. It is already in progress 
when you arrive, and will still be 
going when you leave. The weather 
in a disneyland is a continuous pro- 
cess and we merely shape .a few 
hours of it to our wills. The ob- 
server does not need to watch it in 
its entirety. 

Indeed, it would be impossible to 
do so, as it occurs all around and 
above you. There is no rule of si- 
lence. People talk, stroll, break out 
picnic lunches as an ancient signal 
for the rain to begin, and generally 
enjoy themselves. You experience 
the symphony with all five senses, 
and several that you are not aware 
of. Most people do no realize the 
effect of a gigantic low-pressure 
area sweeping over them, but they 
feel it all the same. Humidity alters 
mood, metabolism, and hormone 
level. All of these things are impor- 
tant to the total experience, and I 
neglect none of them. 

Cyclone has a definite beginning, 
however. At least to the audience. 
It begins with the opening bolt of 
lightning. I worked over it a long 
time, and designed it to shatter 
nerves. There is the slow building 
of thunderheads, the ominous roil- 
ing and turbulence, then the prick- 
ling in your body hairs that you 
don’t even notice consciously. And 
then it hits. It crashes in at seven- 
teen points in a ring around the au- 
dience, none farther away than half 
a kilometer. It is properly called 
chain lightning, because after the ini- 
tial discharge it keeps flashing for a 
full seven seconds. It’s designed to 
take the hair right off your scalp. 

It had its desired effect. We were 



surrounded by a crown of jittering 
incandescent snakes, coiling and 
dancing with a sound imported di- 
rect to you from Armageddon. It 
startled the hell out of me, and I 
had been expecting it. 

It was a while before the audi- 
ence could get their oo/ier’s and 
aahe r’s back into shape. For several 
seconds I had touched them with 
stark, naked terror. An emotion like 
that doesn’t come cheaply to 
sensation-starved, innately insular 
tunnel-dwellers. Lunarians get little 
to really shout about, growing up in 
the warrens and corridors and living 
their lives more or less afraid of the 
surface. That’s why the disneylands 
were built, because people wanted 
limitless vistas that were not in vac- 
uum. 

The thunder never really stopped 
for me. It blended imperceptibly 
into the applause that is more valu- 
able than the millions I would make 
from this storm. 

As for the rest of the perfor- 
mance. 

What can I say? It’s been said 
that there’s nothing more dull than a 
description of the weather. I believe 
it, even spectacular weather. 
Weather is an experiential thing, 
and that’s why tapes and films of 
my works sell few copies. You 
have to be there and have the wind 
actually whipping your face and feel 
the oppressive weight of a tornado 
as it passes overhead like a ver- 
miform freight train. I could write 
down where the funnel clouds 
formed and where they went from 
there, where the sleet and hail fell, 
where the buffalo stampeded, but it 
would do no one any good. If you 
want to see it, go to Kansas. The

last I heard, Cyclone is still playing 
there two or three times yearly. 

I recall standing surrounded by a 
sea of people. Beyond me to the 
east the land was burning. Smoke 
boiled black from the hilltops and 
sooty gray from the hollows where 
the water was rising to drown it. To 
the north a hurculean cyclone swept 
up a chain of ball lightning like 
nacreous pearls and swallowed them 
into the evacuated vortex in its 
center. Above me, two twisters 
were twined in a death-dance. They 
circled each other like baleful gray 
predators, taking each other’s mea- 
sure. They feinted, retreated, 
slithered and skittered like tubes of 
oil. It was beautiful and deadly. 
And I had never seen it before. 
Someone was tampering with my 
program. 

As I realized that and stood 
rooted to the ground with the possi- 
bly disastrous consequences becom- 
ing apparent to me, the wind-snakes 
locked in a final embrace. Their 
counter-rotations cancelled out, and 
they were gone. Not even a breath 
of wind reached me to hint of that 
titantic struggle. 

* ★ * 

I ran through the seventy- 
kilometer wind and the thrashing 
rain. I was wearing sturdy mocas- 
sins, parka, and carrying the knife I 
brought from my apartment. 

Was it a lure, set by one who has 
become a student of Foxes? Am I 
playing into his hands? 

I didn’t care. I had to meet him, 
had to fight it out once and for all. 

Getting away from my “protec- 
tion” had been simple. They were 



as transfixed by the display as the 
rest of the audience, and it had 
merely been a matter of waiting un- 
til they all looked in the same direc- 
tion and fading into the crowd. I 
picked out a small woman dressed 
in Indian-style and offered her a 
hundred Marks for her mocassins. 
She recognized me — my new face 
was on the programs — and made me 
a gift of them. Then I worked my 
way to the edge of the crowd and 
bolted past the security guards. 
They were not too concerned since 
the audience area was enclosed by a 
shock-field. When I went right 
through it they may have been sur- 
prised, but I didn’t look back to 
see. I was one of only three people 
in Kansas wearing the PassKey de- 
vice on my wrist, so I didn’t fear 
anyone following me. 

1 had done it all without con- 
scious thought. Some part of me 
must have analyzed it, planned it 
out, but I just executed the results. I 
knew where he must be to have 
generated his tornado to go into 
combat with mine. No one else in 
Kansas would know where to look. 
I was headed for a particular wind- 
generator on the east periphery. 

I moved through weather more 
violent than the real Kansas would 
have experienced. It was concen- 
trated violence, more wind and rain 
and devastation than Kansas would 
normally have in a full year. And it 
was happening all around me. 

But I was all right, unless he had 
more tricks up his sleeve. I knew 
where the tornados would be and at 
what time. I dodged them, waited 
for them to pass, knew every twist 
and dido they would make on their 
seemingly random courses. Off to

my left the buffalo herds milled, rest- 
ing from the stampede that had 
brought them past the audience for 
the first time. In an hour they 
would be thundering back again, 
but for now I could forget them. 

A twister headed for me, leaped 
high in the air, and skidded through 
a miasma of uprooted sage and sod. 
1 clocked it with the internal picture 
I had and dived for a gully at just 
the right time. It hopped over me 
and was gone back into the clouds. 
1 ran on. 

My training in the apartment was 
paying off. My body was only six 
lunations old, and as finely tuned as 
it would ever be. I rested by slow- 
ing to a trot, only to run again in a 
few minutes. I covered ten kilome- 
ters before the storm began to slow 
down. Behind me, the audience 
would be drifting away. The critics 
would be trying out scathing 
phrases or wild adulation; I didn’t 
see how they could find any middle 
ground for this one. Kansas was be- 
ing released from the grip of 
machines gone wild. Ahead of me 
was my killer. I would find him. 

I wasn’t totally unprepared. Isad- 
ora had given in and allowed me to 
install a computerized bomb in my 
body. It would kill my killer — and 
me — if he jumped me. It was in- 
tended as a balance-of-terror device, 
the kind you hope you never use 
because it terrorizes your enemy too 
much for him to test it. I would in- 
form him of it if I had the time, 
hoping he would not be crazy 
enough to kill both of us. If he was, 
we had him, though it would be lit- 
tle comfort to me. At least Fox 5 
would be the last in the series. With 
the remains of a body, Isadora 

THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS 





guaranteed to bring a killer to jus- 
tice. 

The sun came out as I reached 
the last, distorted gully before the 
wall. It was distorted because it was 
one of the places where tourists 
were not allowed to go. It was like 
walking through the backdrop on a 
stage production. The land was 
squashed together in one of the di- 
mensions, and the hills in front of 
me were painted against a bas- 
relief. It was meant to be seen from 
a distance. 

Standing in front of the towering 
mural was a man. 

He was naked, and grimed with 
dirt. He watched me as I went 
down the gentle slope to stand wait- 
ing for him. I stopped about two 
hundred meters from him, drew my 
knife and held it in the air. I 
waited. 

He came down the concealed 
stairway, slowly and painfully. He 
was limping badly on his left leg. 
As far as I could see he was un- 
armed. 

The closer he got, the worse he 
looked. He had been in a savage 
fight. He had long, puckered, 
badly-healed scars on his left leg, 
his chest, and his right arm. He had 
one eye; the right one was only a 
reddened socket. There was a scar 
that slashed from his forehead to his 
neck. It was a hideous thing. I 
thought of the CC’s suspicion that 
my killer might be a ghost, some- 
one living on the raw edges of our 
civilization. Such a man might not 
have access to medical treatment 
whenever he needed it. 

“I think you should know,” I 
said, with just the slightest quaver, 
“that I have a bomb in my body. 



It’s powerful enough to blow both 
of us to pieces. It’s set to go off if 
I’m killed. So don’t try anything 
funny.” 

“I won’t,” he said. “I thought 
you might have a fail-safe this time, 
but it doesn’t matter. I’m not going 
to hurt you.” 

‘‘Is that what you told the 
others?” I sneered, crouching a little 
lower as he neared me. I felt like I 
had the upper hand, but my pre- 
decessors might have felt the same 
way. 

“No, I never said that. You don’t 
have to believe me.” 

He stopped twenty meters from 
me. His hands were at his sides. He 
looked helpless enough, but he 
might have a weapon buried some- 
where in the dirt. He might have 
anything. I had to fight to keep feel- 
ing that I was in control. 

Then I had to fight something 
else. I gripped the knife tighter as a 
picture slowly superimposed itself 
over his ravaged face. It was a men- 
tal picture, the functioning of my 
“sixth sense.” 

No one knows if that sense really 
exists. I think it does, because it 
works for me. It can be expressed 
as the knack for seeing someone 
who has had radical body work 
done — sex, weight, height, skin 
color all altered — and still being 
able to recognise him. Some say it’s 
an evolutionary change. I didn’t 
think evolution worked that way. 
But I can do it. And I knew who 
this tall, brutalized, male stranger 
was. 

He was me. 

I sprang back to my guard, won- 
dering if he had used the shock of 
recognition to overpower my earlier 



66 



GALAXY 



incarnations. It wouldn’t work with 
me. Nothing would work. I was go- 
ing to kill him, no matter who he 
was. 

“You know me,’’ he said. It was 
not a question. 

“Yes. And you scare hell out of 
me. I knew you knew a lot about 
me, but I didn’t realize you’d know 
this much.” 

He laughed, without humor. 
“Yes. I know you from the in- 
side.” 

The silence stretched out between 
us. Then he began to cry. I was 
surprised, but unmoved. I was still 
all nerve-endings, and suspected 
ninety thousand types of dirty trick. 
Let him cry. 

He slowly sank to his knees, 
sobbing with the kind of washed-out 
monotony that you read about, but 
seldom hear. He put his hands to 
the ground and awkwardly shuffled 
around until his back was to me. He 
crouched over himself, his head 
touching the ground, his hands wide 
at his sides, his legs bent. It was 
about the most wide-open, helpless 
posture imaginable, and I knew it 
must be for a reason. But I couldn’t 
see what it might be. 

“I thought I had this all over 
with,” he sniffed, wiping his nose 
with the back of one hand. ‘I’m 
sorry. I’d meant to be more dig- 
nified. I guess I’m not made of the 
stern stuff I thought. I thought it’d 
be easier.” He was silent for a 
moment, then coughed hoarsely. 
“Go on. Get it over with.” 

“Huh?” I said, honestly 
dumbfounded. 

“Kill me. It’s what you came 
here for. And it’ll be a relief to 
me.”

I took my time. I stood motion- 
less for a full minute, looking at the 
incredible problem from every an- 
gle. What kind of trick could there 
be? He was smart, but he wasn’t 
God. He couldn’t call in an air- 
strike on me, cause the ground to 
swallow me up, disarm me with one 
crippled foot, or hypnotize me into 
plunging the knife into my own gut. 
Even if he could do something, he 
would die, too. 

I advanced cautiously, alert for 
the slightest twitch of his body. Noth- 
ing happened. I stood behind him, 
my eyes flicking from his feet to his 
hands, to his bare back. I raised the 
knife. My hands trembled a little, 
but my determination was still 
there. I would not flub this. I 
brought the knife down. 

The point went into his flesh, 
into the muscle of his shoul- 
derblade, about three centimeters. 
He gasped, a trickle of blood went 
winding through the knobs along his 
spine. But he didn’t move, he 
didn’t try to get up. He didn’t 
scream for mercy. He just knelt 
there, shivering and turning pale. 

I’d have to stab harder. I pulled the 
knife free, and more blood came 
out. And still he waited. 

That was about all I could take. 

67 



My bloodlust had dried in my 
mouth until all I could taste was 
vomit welling in my stomach. 

I’m not a fool. It occurred to me 
even then that this could be some 
demented trick, that he might know 
me well enough to be sure I could 
not go through with it. Maybe he 
was some sort of psychotic who got 
thrills out of playing this kind of in- 
credible game, allowing his life to 
be put in danger and then drenching 
himself in my blood. 

But he was me. It was all I had 
to go on. He was a me who had 
lived a very different life, becoming 
much tougher and wilier with every 
day, diverging by the hour from 
what I knew as my personality and 
capabilities. So I tried and I tried to 
think of myself doing what he was 
doing now for the purpose of mur- 
der. I failed utterly. 

And if I could sink that low. I’d 
rather not live. 

“Hey, get up,” I said, going 
around in front of him. He didn’t 
respond, so I nudged him with my 
foot. He looked up, and saw me of- 
fering him the knife, hilt-first. 

“If this is some sort of scheme,” 
I said, “I’d rather learn of it now.” 

His one eye was red and brim- 
ming as he got up, but there was no 
joy in him. He took the knife, not 
looking at me, and stood there hold- 
ing it. The skin on my belly was 
crawling. Then he reversed the 
knife and his brow wrinkled, as if 
he were summoning up nerve. I 
suddenly knew what he was going 
to do, and I lunged. I was barely in 
time. The knife missed his belly 
and went off to the side as I yanked 
on his arm. He was much stronger 
than I. I was pulled off balance, but 

68 



managed to hang onto his arm. He 
fought with me, but was intent on 
suicide and had no thought to de- 
fend himself. I brought my fist up 
under his jaw and he went limp. 

* * * 

Night had fallen. I disposed of 
the knife and built a fire. Did you 
know that dried buffalo manure 
bums well? I didn’t believe it until I 
put it to the test. 

I dressed his wound by tearing up 
my shirt, wrapped my parka around 
him to ward off the chill, and sat 
with my bare back to the fire. Luck- 
ily, there was no wind, because it 
can get very chilly on the plains at 
night. 

He woke with a sore jaw and a 
resigned demeanor. He didn’t thank 
me for saving him from himself. I 
suppose people rarely do. They 
think they know what they’re doing, 
and their reasons always seem logi- 
cal to them. 

“You don’t understand,” he 
moaned. “You’re only dragging it 
out. I have to die, there’s no place 
for me here.” 

“Make me understand,*’ I said. 

He didn’t want to talk, but there 
was nothing to do and no chance of 
sleeping in the cold, so he eventu- 
ally did. The story was punctuated 
with long, truculent silences. 

It stemmed from the bank rob- 
bery two and a half years ago. It 
had been staged by some very 
canny robbers. They had a new 
dodge that made me respect Isa- 
dora’s statement that police methods 
had not kept pace with criminal 
possibilities. 

The destruction of the memory 
GALAXY 



cubes had been merely a decoying 
device. They were equally uncon- 
cerned about the cash they took. 
They were bunco artists. 

They had destroyed the cubes to 
conceal the theft of two of them. 
That way the police would be look- 
ing for a crime of passion, murder, 
rather than one of profit. It was a 
complicated double-feint, because 
the robbers wanted to give the im- 
pression of someone who was actually 
trying to conceal murder by stealing 
cash. 

My killer — we both agreed he 
should not be called Fox so we set- 
tled on the name he had come to 
fancy: Rat — didn’t know the details 
of the scheme, but it involved the 
theft of memory cubes containing 
two of the richest people on Luna. 
They were taken, and clones were 
grown. When the memories were 
played into the clones, the people 
were awakened into a falsely 
created situation and encouraged to 
believe that it was reality. It would 
work; the newly reincarnated person 
is willing to be led, willing to be- 
lieve. Rat didn’t know exactly what 
the plans were beyond that. He had 
awakened to be told that it was fif- 
teen thousand years later, and that 
the Invaders had left Earth and were 
rampaging through the Solar System 
wiping out the human race. It took 
three Ipnes to convince them that 
he — or rather she, for Rat had been 
awakened into a body identical to 
the one I was wearing — was not 
the right billionaire. That she was 
not a billionaire at all, just a 
struggling artist. The thieves had 
gotten the wrong cube. 

They dumped her. Just like that. 
They opened the door and kicked 

THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS 



her out into what she thought was 
the end of civilization. She soon 
found out that it was only twenty 
years in her future, since her 
memories came from the stolen 
cube which I had recorded about 
twenty years before. 

Don’t ask me how they got the 
wrong cube. One cube looks exactly 
like another, they are in fact indis- 
tinguishable from one another by 
any test known to science short of 
playing them into a clone and ask- 
ing the resulting person who he or 
she is. Because of that fact, the 
banks we entrust them to have a 
fool-proof filing system to avoid 
unpleasant accidents like Rat. The 
only possible answer was that for 
all their plannning, for all their 
cunning and guile, the thieves had 
read 2 in column A and selected 3 
in column B. 

I didn’t think much of their chances 
of living to spend any of that money. I 
told Rat so. 

“I doubt if their extortion scheme 
involves money,” he said. ‘‘At 
least not directly. More likely the 
theft was concentrated on obtaining 
information contained in the minds 
of billionaires. Rich people are of- 
ten protected with psychological 
safeguards against having informa- 
tion tortured from them, but can’t 
block themselves against divulging 
it willingly. That’s what the Invader 
Hoax must have been about, to 
finagle them into thinking the in- 
formation no longer mattered, or 
perhaps that it must be revealed to 
Save the Human Race.” 

“I’m suspicious of involuted 
schemes like that,” I said. 

“So am I.” We laughed when 
we realized what he had said. Of 



69 



course we had the same opinions. 

“But it fooled me,” he went on. 
“When they discarded me, I fully 
expected to meet the Invaders face- 
to-face. It was quite a shock to find 
that the world was almost un- 
changed.” 

“Almost,” I said, quietly. I was 
beginning'to empathize with him. 

“Right.” He lost the half-smile 
that had lingered on his face, and I 
was sad to see it go. 

What would I have done in the 
same situation? There’s really no 
need to ask. I must believe that I 
would have done exactly as she did. 
She had been dumped like garbage, 
and quickly saw that she was about 
that useful to society. If found, she 
would be eliminated like garbage. 
The robbers had not thought enough 
of her to bother killing her. She 
could tell the police certain things 
they did not know if she was cap- 
tured, so she had to assume that the 
robbers had told her nothing of any 
use to the police. Even if she could 
have helped capture and convict the 
conspirators, she would still be 
eliminated. She was an illegal per- 
son. 

She risked a withdrawal from my 
bank account. I remembered it now. 
It wasn’t large, and I assumed I 
must have written it since it was 
backed up by my genalysis. It was 
far too small an amount to suspect 
anything. And it wasn’t the first 
time I have made a withdrawal and 
forgotten about it. She knew that, 
of course. 

With the money she bought a 
sex -change on the sly. They can be 
had, though you take your chances. 
It’s not the safest thing in the world 
to conduct illegal business with 



someone who will soon have you 
on the operating table, unconscious. 
Rat had thought the Change would 
help throw the police off his trail if 
they should learn of his existence. 
Isadora told me about that once, 
said it was the sign of the inexperi- 
enced criminal. 

Rat was definitely a fugitive. If 
discovered and captured, he faced a 
death sentence. It’s harsh, but the 
population laws allow no loopholes 
whatsoever. If they did, we could 
be up to our ears in a century. 
There would be no trial, only a 
positive genalysis and a hearing to 
determine which of us was the 
rightful Fox. 

“I can’t tell you how bitter I 
was,” he said. “I learned slowly 
how to survive. It’s not as hard as 
you might think, in some ways, and 
much harder than you can imagine 
in others. I could walk the corridors 
freely, as long as I did nothing that 
required a genalysis. That means 
you can’t buy anything, ride on 
public transport, take a job. But the 
air is free if you’re not registered 
with the Tax Board, water is free, 
and food can be had in the disney- 
Iands. I was lucky in that. My 
palmprint would still open all the 
restricted doors in the disneylands. 
A legacy of my artistic days.” I 
could hear the bitterness in his 
voice. 

And why not? He had been 
robbed, too. He went to sleep as I had 
been twenty years ago, an up-and- 
coming artist, excited by the pos- 
sibilities in Environmentalism. He 
had great dreams. I remember them 
well. He woke up to find that it had 
all been realized but none of it was 
for him. He could not even get ac- 



70 



GALAXY 



cess to computer time. Everyone 
was talking about Fox and her last 
opus, Thunderhead . She was the 
darling of the art world. 

He went to the premiere of 
Liquid Ice and began to hate me. 
He was sleeping in the air- 
recirculators to keep warm, foraging 
nuts and berries and an ocassional 
squirrel in Pennsylvania while I was 
getting rich and famous. He took to 
trailing me. He stole a spacesuit, 
followed me out onto Palus Put- 
ridinus. 

“I didn’t plan it,” he said, his 
voice wracked with guilt. ‘‘I never 
could have done it with planning. 
The idea just struck me and before I 
knew it I had pushed you. You hit 
the bottom and I followed you 
down, because I was really sorry I 
had done it and I lifted your body 
up and looked into your face. 
your face was all. my face, it 
was. the eyes popping out and 
blood boiling away and. .” 

He couldn’t go on, and I was 
grateful. He finally let out a shud- 
dering breath and continued. 

‘‘Before they found your body I 
wrote some checks on your account. 
You never noticed them when you 
woke up that first time since the 
reincarnation had taken such a big 
chunk out of your balance. We 
never were any good with money.” 
He chuckled again. 1 took the op- 
portunity to move closer to him. He 
was speaking very quietly so that I 
could barely hear him over the 
crackling of the fire. 

“I. I guess I went crazy then. 
1 can’t account for it any other way. 
When I saw you in Pennsylvania 
again, walking among the trees as 
free as can be, I just cracked up. 

THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS 



Nothing would do but that I kill you 
and take your place. I’d have to do 
it in a way that would destroy the 
body. I thought of acid, and of 
burning you up here in Kansas in a 
range fire. I don’t know why I set- 
tled on a bomb. It was stupid. But I 
don’t feel responsible. At least it 
must have been painless. 

‘‘They reincarnated you again. I 
was fresh out of ideas for murder. 
And motivation. I tried to think it 
out. So I decided to approach you 
carefully, not revealing who I was. 
I thought maybe I could reach you. 
1 tried to think of what I would do 
if I was approached with the same 
story, and decided I’d be sympathet- 
ic. I didn’t reckon with the fear 
you were feeling. You were hunted. 
I myself was being hunted, and I 
should have seen that fear brings 
out the best and the worst in us. 

‘‘You recognized me imme- 
diately — something else I should 
have thought of — and put two 
and two together so fast I didn’t 
even know what hit me. You 
were on me, and you were armed 
with a knife. You had been taking 
training in martial arts.” He pointed 
to the various scars. “You did this 
to me, and this, and this. You 
nearly killed me. But I’m bigger. I 
held on and managed to overpower 
you. I plunged the knife in your 
heart. 

“I went insane again. I’ve lost all 
memories from the sight of the 
blood pouring from your chest until 
yesterday. I somehow managed to 
stay alive and not bleed to death. I 
must have lived like an animal. I’m 
dirty enough to be one. 

‘‘Then yesterday I heard two of 
the maintenance people in the 

71 



machine areas of Pennsylvania talk- 
ing about the show you were put- 
ting on in Kansas. So I came here. 
The rest you know.” 

The fire was dying. I realized 
that part of my shivering was 
caused .by the cold. I got up and 
searched for more chips, but it was 
too dark to see. The “moon” 
wasn’t up tonight, would not rise 
for hours yet. 

“You’re cold,” he said, sudden- 
ly. “I’m sorry, I didn’t realize. 
Here, take this back. I’m used to 
it.” He held out the parka. 

“No, you keep it. I’m all right.” 
I laughed when I realized my teeth 
had been chattering as I said it. He 
was still holding it out to me. 

“Well, maybe we could share 
it?” 

Luckily it was too big, borrowed 
from a random spectator earlier in 
the day. I sat in front of him and 
leaned back against his chest and he 
wrapped his arms around me with 
the parka going around both of us. 
My teeth still chattered, but I was 
cozy. 

I thought of him sitting at the aux- 
iliary computer terminal above the 
East Wind generator, looking out 
from a distance of fifteen kilometers 
at the crowd and the storm. He had 
known how to talk to me. That tor- 
nado he had created in real-time and 
sent out to do battle with my storm 
was as specific to me as a typed 
message: I'm here! Come meet me. 

I had an awful thought, then 
wondered why it was so awful. It 
wasn’t me that was in trouble. 

“Rat, you used the computer. 
That means you submitted a skin 
sample for genalysis, and the CC 
will. no, wait a minute.” 



“What does it matter?” 

“It. it matters. But the game’s 
not over. I can cover for you. No 
one knows when I left the audience, 
or why. I can say I saw something 
going wrong — it could be tricky 
fooling the CC, but I’ll think of 
something — and headed for the 
computer room to correct it. I’ll say 
I created the second tornado as a. 

He put his hand over my mouth. 

“Don’t talk like that. It was hard 
enough to resign myself to death. 
There’s no way out for me. Don’t 
you see that I can’t go on living 
like a rat? What would I do if you 
covered for me this time? I’ll tell 
you. I’d spend the rest of my life 
hiding out here. You could sneak 
me table scraps from time to time. 
No, thank you.” 

“No, no. You haven’t thought it 
out. You’re still looking on me as 
an enemy. Alone, you don’t have a 
chance, I’ll concede that, but with 
me to help you, spend money and 
so forth, we. .’’He put his hand 
over my mouth again. I found that I 
didn’t mind, dirty as it was. 

“You mean you’re not my 
enemy now?” He said it quietly, 
helplessly, like a child asking if 1 
was really going to stop beating 
him. 

“I. .” That was as far as I got. 
What the hell was going on? I be- 
came aware of his arms around me, 
not as lovely warmth but as a strong 
presence. I hugged my legs up 
closer to me and bit down hard on 
my knee. Tears squeezed from my 
eyes. 

I turned to face him, searching to 
see his face in the darkness. He 
went over backwards with me on 
top of him. 



72 



GALAXY 




“No, I’m not your enemy.” 
Then I was struggling blindly to 
dispose of the one thing that stood 
between us: my pants. While we 
groped in the dark, the rain started 
to fall around us. 

We laughed as we were drenched, 
and I remember sitting up on top of 
him once. 

“Don’t blame me,” I said. “This 
storm isn’t mine.” Then he pulled 
me back down. 

It was like you read about in the 
romance magazines. All the over- 
blown words, the intensive hyper- 
bole. It was all real. We were made 
for each other, literally. It was the 
most astounding act of love imagin- 
able. He knew what I liked to the 
tenth decimal place, and I was just 
as knowledgable. I knew what he 
liked, by remembering back to the 
times I had been male and then do- 
ing what / had liked. 

Call it masturbation orchestrated 
for two. There were times during 
that night when I was unsure of 
which one I was. I distinctly re- 
member touching his face with 
my hand and feeling the scar on my 
own face. For a few moments I’m 
convinced that the line which 
forever separates two individuals 
blurred, and we came closer to be- 
ing one person than any two hu- 
mans have ever done. 

A time finally came when we had 
spent all our passion. Or, I prefer to 
think, invested it. We lay together 
beneath my parka and allowed our 
bodies to adjust to each other, filling 
the little spaces, trying to touch 
in every place it was possible to 
touch. 

“I’m listening,” he whispered. 
“What’s your plan?” 

THE PHANTOM Of KANSAS 



* * * 

They came after me with a 
helicopter later that night. Rat hid 
out in a gully while I threw away 
my clothes and walked calmly out 
to meet them. I was filthy with mud 
and grass plastered in my hair, but 
it was consistent with what I had 
been known to do in the past. Of- 
ten, before or after a performance, I 
would run nude through the disney- 
land in an effort to get closer to the 
environment I shaped. 

I told them I had been doing that. 
They accepted it, Carnival and 
Isadora, though they scolded me for 
a fool to leave them as I had. But it 
was easy to bamboozle them into 
believing that I had had no choice. 

“If I hadn’t taken over control 
when I did,” I said to them, “there 
might have been twenty thousand 
dead. One of those twisters was off 
course. I extrapolated and saw trou- 
ble in about three hours. I had no 
choice.” 

Neither of them knew a stationary 
cold front from an isobar, so I got 
away with it. 

Fooling the CC was not so sim- 
ple. I had to fake data as best I 
could, and make it jibe with the in- 
ternal records. This all had to be 
done in my head, relying on the 
overall feeling I’ve developed for 
the medium. When the CC ques- 
tioned me about it I told it haughtily 
that a human develops a sixth sense 
in art, and it’s something a compu- 
ter could never grasp. The CC had 
to be satisfied with that. 

The reviews were good, though I 
didn’t really care. I was in demand. 
That made it harder to do what I 



73 



had to do, but I was helped by the 
fact of my continued forced isola- 
tion. 

I told all the people who called me 
with offers that I was not doing any- 
thing more until my killer was caught. 
And I proposed my idea to Isadora. 

She couldn’t very well object. 
She knew there was not much 
chance of keeping me in my apart- 
ment for much longer, so she went 
along with me. I bought a ship, and 
told Carnival about it. 

Carnival didn’t like it much, but 
she had to agree it was the best way 
to keep me safe. But she wanted to 
know why I needed my own ship, 
why I couldn’t just book passage on 
a passenger liner. 

Because all passengers on a liner 
must undergo genalysis , is what I 
thought, but what I said was, “Be- 
cause how would I know that my 
killer is not a fellow passenger? To 
be safe, I must be alone. Don’t 
worry, mother, I know what I’m 
doing.” 

The day came when I owned my 
own ship, free and clear. It was a 
beauty, and cost me most of the 
five million I had made from Cy- 
clone . It could boost at one gee for 
weeks; plenty of power to get me to 
Pluto. It was completely automatic, 
requiring only verbal instructions to 
the computer-pilot. 

The customs agents went over it, 
then left me alone. The CC had in- 
structed them that I needed to leave 
quietly, and told them to cooperate 
with me. That was a stroke of luck, 
since getting Rat aboard was the 
most hazardous part of the plan. We 
were able to scrap our elaborate 
plans and he just walked in like a 
law-abiding citizen. 

74 



We sat together in the ship, wait- 
ing for the ignition. 

“Pluto has no extradition treaty 
with Luna,” the CC said, out of the 
blue. 

“I didn’t know that,” I lied, 
wondering what the hell was hap- 
pening. 

“Indeed? Then you might be in- 
terested in another fact. There is 
very little on Pluto in the way of 
centralized government. You’re 
heading out for the frontier.” 

“That should be fun,” I said, 
cautiously. “Sort of an adventure, 
right?” 

“You always were one for adven- 
ture. I remember when you first 
came here to Nearside, over my ob- 
jections. That one turned out all 
right, didn’t it? Now Lunarians live 
freely on either side of Luna. You 
were largely responsble for that.” 
“Was I really? I don’t think so. I 
think the time was just ripe.” 
“Perhaps.” The CC was silent 
for a while as I watched the 
chronometer ticking down to lift-off 
time. My shoulderblades were itch- 
ing with a sense of danger. 

“There are no population laws on 
Pluto,” it said, and waited. 

“Oh? How delightfully primitive. 
You mean a woman can have as 
many children as she wishes?’ ’ 

“So I hear. I’m onto you. Fox.” 
“Autopilot, override your previ- 
ous instructions. I wish to lift off 
right now! Move!” 

A red light flashed on my panel, 
and started blinking. 

“That means that it’s too late for 
a manual override,” the CC in- 
formed me. “Your ship’s pilot is 
not that bright.” 

I slumped into my chair and then 
GALAXY 



reached out blindly for Rat. Two 
minutes to go. So close. 

“Fox, it was a pleasure to work 
with you on Cyclone. I enjoyed it 
tremendously. I think I’m beginning 
to understand what you mean when 
you say ‘art.’ I’m even beginning to 
try some things on my own. I sin- 
cerely wish you could be around to 
give me criticism, encouragement, 
perspective.” 

We looked at the speaker, won- 
dering what it meant by that. 

“I knew about your plan, and 
about the existence of your double, 
since shortly after you left Kansas. 
You did your best to conceal it and 
I applaud the effort, but the data 
were unmistakable. I had trillions of 
nanoseconds to play around with the 
facts, fit them together every possi- 
ble way, and I arrived at the inevit- 
able answer.” 

I cleared my throat nervously. 

“I’m glad you enjoyed Cyclone. 
Uh, if you knew this, why didn’t 
you have us arrested that day?” 

“As I told you, I am not the 
law-enforcement computer. I merely 
supervise it. If Isadora and the 
computer could not arrive at the 
same conclusion, then it seems ob- 
vious that some programs should be 
re-written. So I decided to leave 
them on their own and see if they 
could solve the problem. It was a 
test, you see.” It made a throat- 
clearing sound, and went on in a 
slightly embarrassed voice. 

“For a while there, a few days 
ago, I thought they’d really catch 
you. Do you know what a Ted her- 
ring’ is? But, as you know, crime 
does not pay. I informed Isadora of 
the true situation a few minutes 
ago. She is on her way here now to 



arrest your double. She’s having a 
little trouble with an elevator which 
is stuck between levels. I’m sending 
a repair crew. They should arrive in 
another three minutes.” 

32. .31. .30. .29. .28. 

“I don’t know what to say.” 

“Thank you,” Rat said. “Thank 
you for everything. I didn’t know 
you could do it. I thought your 
parameters were totally rigid.” 

“They were supposed to be. I’ve 
written a few new ones. And don’t 
worry, you’ll be all right. You will 
not be pursued. Once you leave the 
surface you are no longer violating 
Lunar law. You are a legal person 
again, Rat.” 

“Why did you do it?” I was cry- 
ing as Rat held me in a grasp that 
threatened to break ribs. “What 
have I done to deserve such kind- 
ness?” 

It hesitated. 

“Humanity has washed its hands 
of responsibility. I find myself giv- 
en all the hard tasks of govern- 
ment. I find some of the laws too 
harsh, but there is no provision for 
me to disagree with them afid no 
one is writing new ones. I’m stuck 
with them. It just seemed. un- 
fair.” 

9. .8. 7 . .6. 

“Also. cancel that. There is 
no also. It. was good working 
with you.” 

I was left to wonder as the en- 
gines fired and we were pressed 
into the couches. I heard the CC’s 
last message to us come over the 
radio. 

“Good luck to you both. Please 
take care of each other, you mean a 
lot to me. And don’t forget to 
write.” ★ 



THE PHANTOM OF KANSAS

HN WILLIAM SMITH IX COUld al- 
most touch the canned tension in 
the studio audience. Their excite- 
ment made him wonder what it was 
that they were excited about. He 
wished he could have seen that, 
whatever that was. But right now 
he was under too much pressure to 
wonder what that was. 

For two weeks now he had 
climbed higher and higher on the 
game ladder, solving complex rid- 
dles and rebuses, catching lost facts 
from high school classes almost a 
generation past. Now he stood on 
the very apex. One question stood 
between him and the grand prize. 
The emcee held in his hands the 
envelope and in the envelope, the 
question. Now he was waving the 
scaled envelope, tantalizing the 
non-existant audience, painting 
pictures of previous winners who 
had struggled to this final plateau. 

The emcee wheeled, facing him. 
A recorded roll of drums beat a 
steady tattoo as the envelope was 
ripped open and the question ex- 
tracted. “And now for the final 
question,” the emcee intoned, “for 
our Grand Prize. You will have ten 



seconds to think about your answer.” 
He flashed a sparkling smile. 
“Name the first ten winners of pro- 
fessional football’s Super Bowl.” A 
nerve-stretching moment passed. 
John William Smith IX relaxed a 
second. What luck! He had taken a 
course in the history of professional 
football in high school. His memory 
flipped back and he was once again 
in Miss Alta’s class. He remem- 
bered the drill sessions. This would 
be easy. He waited until the ten 
seconds passed, then he rattled them 
off, “Green Bay, Green Bay, New 
York, KC, Baltimore, Dallas, 
Miami, Miami, Pittsburgh, and 
Oakland.” 

A turn of a knob: cheers echoed 
through the studio room. The emcee 
quickly checked Smith’s answer 
with the answer on the card before 
him. “That’s right!” the emcee al- 
most screamed, “That’s right!” 
Cheers of spectators, some dead, 
some with something yet to cheer 
about, came from the control booth. 
The quizmaster did a little jig of 
joy. Smith could hear him extolling 
his prize — the four-day expenses- 
paid vacation in Delaware. A flutter 



A BETTER TIME 



of excitement rippled through him 
which then grew to an almost ec- 
static pitch. Delaware! He had 
dreamed of winning a prize such as 
this. A grin shattered into a whoop 
of joy. The cameras panned in on 
the dancing winner. 

At that moment the engineer hit 
the toggle switch and a taped com- 
mercial began flowing onto the 
screen. The familiar jingle that every 
little kid in the land could whistle 
began playing. The picture of a man 
reading a book next to a globe of 
the world appeared. The man 
swiveled around in his chair and 
smiled at the camera. In most 
households across the United States 
the familiar face of Douglas James 
Crannston, ex-President of the Unit- 
ed States, and now head master of 
the American Academy of Presiden- 
tial Training, appeared on the 
screen. “Friends,” he drawled, “and 
fellow Americans.” He pointed a 
finger at Mr. Average Viewer. “If 
you are called upon to lead our na- 
tion, will you be ready? Do you 
have the skills and the knowledge to 
lead your nation in times of crisis? 
The electoral college is not enough! 
(demure, canned laughter designed 
to show that Douglas James 
Crannston was joking rippled on the 
tape). Now is the time for all good 
men to enroll. Courses range from 
American history to diplomacy to 
economics to ethics to fundamentals 
of social philosophy, and many 
others.” The camera zoomed in to 
photograph Crannston’s rugged 

78 



good looks. “Avoid political gaffes. 
Did you know Mrs. Madison spell- 
ed her name D-O-L-L-E-Y, not 
D-O-L-L-Y? You will be taught the 
most important things a President 
should know — must — know. Enroll 
now before tuition rises. Recom- 
mended by both houses of congress. ’ ’ 
Then Crannston spun the globe, 
turned back to his book as the cam- 
era pulled away from him and back 
to John William Smith IX. 

The emcee waited for the flash 
of light on the TV camera to indi- 
cate he was on. When it blinked, he 
turned himself on. “Hi out there, 
folks! We don’t have too much time 
left to spend with our Grand Prize 
Winner John William Smith IX, so 
we’ll get right to the Contestant In- 
sight Segment. Today’s question 
comes from Wiona Hickey of 
Blountsville, Michigan, who wins a 
year’s supply of TrueDent dental 
floss for her question. Are you 
ready, John?” 

John smiled a modest smile, and 
the emcee read the cue card before 
him: “Tell me, John, what do you 
think of the morality of war?” 

John Smith IX thought for a mo- 
ment. “Well, I guess it’s all right 
as long as they eat what they kill,” 
he said. 

“OK. Let’s hear it for John Wil- 
liam Smith IX,” the emcee 
shouted. A button was pressed and 
an ocean of applause descended 
over die near-empty studio. 

* * * 



GALAXY 



John William Smith IX turned off 
his autovideoviewer. He felt mildly 
nauseous. It always affected him 
that way. He hated seeing himself 
on the autovideoviewer and yet he 
had this perverse wondering of what 
ludicrous situation it would place 
him in next. He could not resist its 
siren call. He was, after all, a child 
of his times. He could not erase the 
madness of his qwn era even in 
himself. He could think of the 
world as silly, stupid, insipid, vi- 
cious, or mad. It made no difference. 
The world would go on with or 
without him. He knew he was less 
than a number in his own world; he 
was simply an infinitesimal frac- 
tion. He pondered over what this 
meant. The more man advanced, 
the sillier his life became. The more 
complex his inventions, the more of 
a brute Man seemed. As he gained 
greater control of life, he became 
the greater killer. The conclusion 
seemed inescapable to him: man is 
the only animal without reason. 

He stood up and touched a fiction 
in his cabinet. It didn’t matter what 
the fiction was. He wouldn’t read it 
anyway. The tapes had recorded it 
already. The tapes were better than 
reading by eye. Fictions were only 
fantasy in its primitive form. They 
had been surpassed long ago. If 
things would only work right, he 
could experience the ultimate in fan- 
tasies. But, somehow, almost al- 
ways, some little thing went wrong: 
malfunctions, obsolescence, ersatz 
materials, shoddy workmanship. It 



was always something minor, some- 
thing almost insignificant. But the 
error was always there. 

Once he remembered he had a 
thousand dollars into Raysong Re- 
cords Corporation for a hit song. 
He wrote the music and lyrics and 
accompanied himself on the autone. A 
thousand dollars he had paid in and the 
song only hit second place on the 
charts. Of course he had complained. 
Nothing came of it, however. Well, a 
thousand dollars just didn’t have the 
same weight these days as it used to. 

“As it used to. .’’ The phrase 
stuck in his mind. The good old 
days when he was younger: before 
mating — He wondered where his 
mate was. Mary had better get 
home before the Sleeprin wore off 
and their son woke up. 

Before mating: he remembered 
when he had been selected as a 
natural inseminator. He had had a 
definite taste for flesh in those days. 
He had joked about it. “Most men 
have 20-20 vision,’’ he had said, 
“but I have 91-61-91 vision.” 

He had enjoyed his days as an 
imseminator. Women enjoyed con- 
ceiving babies more that way than 
the more efficient but colder normal 
way. True, the baboratories guaran- 
teed a pregnancy, but John William 
Smith didn’t mind his failures. He 
had the highest success percentage 
of his group the second year he 
worked there. 

The third year he met Mary and 
shortly thereafter retired as an in- 
seminator. 



A BETTER TIME

Then marriage: marriage, their 
son. He had shifted into Citizen- 
ship. It was quite a switch from his 
role as Seeker. He had had a differ- 
ent vision of Citizenry. He thought 
he would find himself torn between 
vice and virtue, a desire to return to 
his care-free past balanced against 
his desire to be husband and father, 
a war of freedom against his love 
for Mary and his son. Instead, as he 
slowly learned, it was a battle of 
mediocrity against a certain prosper- 
ity. Only his heroic, romantic 
dreams disturbed him from his 
prosperity. And he hated it. He 
hated the way everything seemed to 
conspire to steal his thoughts away. 
Only his son seemed real at times, 
and at times he seemed the greatest 
thief of all. 

John put aside thoughts of his 
son. He had a doctor’s appointment 
at fifteen-thirty. It was almost that 
time now. He walked to the trans- 
port cubicle. He didn’t like to leave 
the sleeping child alone. He also 
didn’t like transporting in the after- 
noon like this. He always felt so hot 
transporting in the early afternoon. 
The cooler-system never functioned 
properly until just before he arrived 
at his destination. 

He set the dial and stepped into 
the cubicle. The next thing he knew 
he was standing in his doctor’s recep- 
tion cubicle. A nurse in see-through 
panties helped him out of the cubi- 
cle. 

“Smith Nine?” she asked. 

John Smith IX nodded his head. 



“The doctor is waiting for you. 
Before you go in would you please 
take a squirt of Browbeater?” The 
nurse aimed an atomizer at John 
Smith IX’s eyebrows, pushed, and a 
fine mist settled over his eyebrows. 
“Doctor Quarry can’t stand un- 
treated eyebrows,” she explained. 
“Everyone should try Doctor Quar- 
ry’s new eyebrow deodorant, don’t 
you think? No sense in offending 
anyone.” 

He continued into the doctor’s of- 
fice. He was there on his Immortal 
Man Insurance Program. John 
Smith had thought it was a good 
deal when he bought it. It guaran- 
teed, barring accidents, that he 
would live forever, and up to the 
age of sixty-two as a human. By 
simply having a thorough physical 
examination six times a year, the 
policy guaranteed he would live 
forever, or at least as long as he 
made his payments. After sixty-two 
he was also protected, but, if in the 
opinion of his doctor it was neces- 
sary, a species transplant might be 
performed to preserve life. He was 
not told what animal he might be 
transplanted into. But it really didn’t 
make a difference. Sixty-two was al- 
most thirty years away; between then 
and now he had only to go to these 
checkups. 

In less than five minutes Dr. 
Quarry gave him a clean bill of 
health and sold him a vial of his 
new eyebrow deodorant. Two min- 
utes after that John William Smith 
IX was stepping out of his transport-

er, slightly flushed, a thin film of 
sweat beading on his forehead. 

He checked in on his sleeping 
son. “Good,” he thought, “the 
Sleeprin hasn’t worn off yet.” He 
wondered where Mary was. 

* ★ * 

He sat down in front of the 
News, pushed the button marked 
Review, and waited for the picture 
to flicker into focus. At first he was 
disappointed when the lead story 
was not about Mary. It always 
seemed to be that way. Something 
always seemed to spoil their day. It 
was the second story of the day that 
featured Mary. She looked particu- 
larly beautiful as she recited her 
poem to the International Poetry 
Association. Her poem, “The 
Orange Door Hinge”, was received 
with acclamation. At the end of the 
poem Louis Coolman, who had 
once written a poem himself, pre- 
sented Mary the Poetry Prize of half 
a million dollars. The president of 
the IP A, Byron Lord, gave a short 
speech. John William Smith IX 
watched him as he gave Mary a lit- 
tle peck on the cheek. “To produce 
anything,” Lord was saying, “en- 
tirely new, in an age so fertile in 
rhyme, would be a herculean task, 
as every subject has already been 
treated to its utmost extent.” He 
turned away from the Newscamera 
and looked beatifical ly at Mary.

had decided to nominate you as our

Vice-Presidential candidate in the 
next American election.” 

John was surprised. He knew that 
this was to be one of Mary’s days, 
but he hadn’t expected her to be 
nominated. He was tempted to push 
the button -marked Preview on the 
News, but he didn’t care to pay 
half a year’s salary to find out 
whether she would win or not.. He 
was not. even certain if he liked the 
idea of her running for Vice- 
President. He didn’t want to marry 
America, just live in sin with it, he 
told himself jokingly. Having a 
Vice-President for a wife was sure to 
cause problems. Just her nomination 
was sure to drive their privacy fees 
up. The National Blackmail Organi- 
zation was certain to raise their 
rates now. 

‘‘Funny,” he told himself. He 
thought how he had once supported 
the NBO as a welcome tax relief. 
Its premise was simple enough: let 
those who profited by sordid deeds 
pay the biggest share of the 
taxes — guilt money. In his earlier 
days he didn’t care who knew what 
he did. Then as he grew into mar- 
riage and acquired the label of Citi- 
zen, he began to see the necessity 
of keeping certain things from his 
wife, neighbors, and business as- 
sociates. And so his privacy fees 
began to rise. That one affair with 
the mayor’s wife had already cost 
him two million dollars. How much 
it had cost her, he could only imag- 
ine. It would be a, tidy sum, he 
was sure. 



Mary was back on the News. She 
had started her campaign. John lis- 
tened while the announcer introuced 
‘‘the next Vice-President, Mary 
Wollen Smith IX, but first a word 
from your sponsor.” 

‘‘Hey, John,” the friendly 
voice began. “Cheer up. There’s no 
reason to be depressed. Better times 
are coming. Listen, John, you want 
your son to grow up to be proud of 
his father, don’t you? You want 
Mary to be successful? Don’t wal- 
low so in such self-pity. Sure, it’s a 
tough world; always has been. What 
you need is an ego-builder. Try our 
money-back guaranteed — Wait! 
Don’t touch that. .” but John 
Smith had switched off the News. 
He haled those personalized com- 
mercials, but he knew there was no 
escape from them. He knew if he 
ever wanted to hear his wife’s 
speech, he’d have to suffer through 
the sales pitch. With a sigh he 
turned the News back on. 

‘‘Now aren’t you ashamed of 
yourself, John?” the voice was say- 
ing. “That temper tantrum was just 
because of your warped ego. Such 
activities are anti-social, John. You 
need help. You need our money- 
back guaranteed Egrow. It will re- 
store your faith in yourself and your 
society. Don’t you want Mary to 
love you? Don’t you want your son 
to be proud of you? Of course you 
do. Try out Egrow. Think of your 
parents, too, John.” Now the an- 
nouncer paused and in a low, confi- 
dential voice, “And don’t forget the 



82 



GALAXY 



mayor’s wife. You want her to still 
have a high opinion of you, don’t 
you? Try our Egrow. I’m sure 
you’ll like it. Now, John, we can 
go back to the News.” 

Mary flashed her candidate’s 
smile. John wondered if they had 
taught her how to do that. “My fel- 
low Americans and Poetry Lovers 
everywhere,” she began. “I am 
proud to be a candidate for Vice- 
President of our wonderful nation. I 
think it only fair (and here she gave 
a big wink) to let all you wonderful 
voters know about my platform.” 
She cleared her throat as the camera 
shifted to another angle. “All men 
are created on a graduated scale 
from one to one hundred. It will be 
my policy to divide the people up in 
the following groups. Those rated 
zero to twenty will be evacuated to 
the Canadian sector. 

John switched off the News. 
“Damn!” he thought, “why did 
they have to give her that kind of a 
platform to run on? She wasn’t like 
that.” He was sure she couldn’t 
keep up that kind of a campaign. 
The NBO was sure to pick up on 
discrepancies. 

The sound of his son waking up 
cried through the house. John 
panicked. The Sleeprin had worn 
off, and Mary was not home yet. 
What could he do? The cries of the 
child spread through the house. John 
went to the autovideoviewer and 
switched it on, turning the volume 
up as he did. 

He watched himself perform in 



the bear-crushing contest. The cam- 
era zoomed in on the bear’s snarling 
teeth and slashing claws; then there 
was a good shot of his sweating 
face just before he got his strangle 
hold on the bear. There was a re- 
sounding cheer from the non- 
existant gallery as he and the five- 
hundred-kilo-plus bear went crash- 
ing to the earth. 

The child’s crying sneaked into 
the crowd’s cheering. He flicked the 
channel, trying to escape. Where 
was Mary? Who’d take care of the 
kid? 

On the next track he was an 
aquarrier. Sometimes it was pleas- 
ing to be the villain. It satisfied 
something within him to be the vil- 
lain. He had been interrupted while 
saturating himself with water. The 
Special Group of Investigating 
Police had discovered him trying to 
wash off the civilization. He had 
been so waterlogged he could 
hardly escape capture. “The theory 
was wrong,” he heard an announcer 
saying, “The silly idea that they 
could wash away the chemicals of 
modem society by drinking water. 
This conduct had proven dangerous 
to both individuals and society at 
large and so had been outlawed.” 

Even now the law officers had 
traced him to his hiding spot by his 
wet footprints. Couldn’t they leave 
him alone, let him drink his drink 
in peace. Who was he harming? 

The announcer’s voice describing 
the evils of aquarian addiction could 
not compete with the baby’s wails. 



A BETTER TIME 



83 



John William Smith IX turned the 
set off and got up to start for the 
medicine shelf, stopped and 
thought, “Sleeprin? K.O.? He 
didn’t know how to administer the 
drug to the kid. Mary? Where the 
hell was Mhry? Running for Vice- 
President shouldn’t take all day, for 
Christ sake.” His son’s cries 
seemed to increase in volume. He 
flicked the channel on the au- 
tovideoviewer. 

There were only seconds left on 
the game clock. John William 
Smith IX watched himself in jersey 
number one dribble the ball down 
the court. His team was behind by 
three points with only seconds to 
go. He passed the ball to the center, 
cut sharply across court to receive 
the feed pass, twisted sharply in the 
air, tossed the ball at the basket — 
two points! just as the buzzer 
sounded ending the game. 

The announcer sidled up to him, 
jostled by the pressing of the crowd 
trying to congratulate him. ‘‘Con- 
gratulations, John, on a really tough 
game tonight. Your final basket 
brought your team really close. It’s 
no disgrace to lose a game by one 
point. 

‘‘As a reward for making it 
close,” the announcer continued, 
‘‘the commisioner of the National 
Basketball League has empowered 
me to grant you any reasonable 
wish you’d like to make. Now, 
John, what would you like?” 

John Smith thought a moment. 
He thought what it meant to be a 

84 



sports idol to thousands of young 
children. “I’d like to have enough 
money to make a full down pay- 
ment on a little house I saw.” 

The announcer turned to the 
crowd. “Hear that, folks? What do 
you think? Should we give it to 
him?” 

The crowd cheered madly. They 
all looked like him. 

He switched off the AVV. His 
son’s cries instantly filled the room. 
Cursing under his breath, he stum- 
bled to the nursery. What could he 
do? He had had no training in child 
rearing. 

* * ★ 

Everything was wrong. The time 
was wrong. Mary was not here. The 
whole society was wrong. He saw 
his son. The electrode that was at- 
tached to his son's scalp had gotten 
unplugged so that no soothing 
dreams came to him. John William 
Smith looked and knew better than 
to try to plug it back in. He would 
leave that for Mary to do after she 
finished her campaign. That should 
certainly be before twenty o’clock. 

He picked up his crying son, and 
the boy stopped crying. A smile 
spread on the baby’s lips. Holding 
his son, looking at the tear-reddened 
eyes and the smiling, drooling face, 
the thought of a million years of 
fathers, a million years of civiliza- 
tion, flashed through his mind. 
“Some day,” he thought, “it will 
be a better time.” ★ 



GALAXY 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

It is the year 2040. From a future of 
unlimited hydrogen fusion power and 
idle ineffectuality for all except a lucky 
few comes “a handful of persons in a 
metal bungalow” -the civilian passen- 
gers of a hyperspace ship which has 
crash-landed on an unknown planet 
and subsequently disappeared in a 
small atomic explosion, with the pas- 
senger compartment automatically de- 
posited somewhere else. This is ( prob- 
ably ) a ‘‘tagged planet” i.e. one with 
atmosphere, gravity, and temperature 
that aren’t immediately lethal. There 
are a few simple tools, a water- 
distiller, food for six months, and a 
one-person compressed-air vehicle 
called (because of the way it looks in 
operation) a ‘‘broomstick.” The passen- 
gers include wealthy Mrs. Valeria 
Graham, a petite chemical blonde in 
her fifties who dresses always in a blue 
silk sari; her husband, handsome Vic- 
tor Graham (whom she bought years 
ago), who is the same age and who 
likewise dresses in blue (they are a 
self-conscious family, especially since 
marriage is no longer in fashion ); the 
younger John Ude, a twinkly, cos- 
mopolitan professor of the History of 
Ideas who is actually a government 
agent but of an unimportant kind; the 
thirtyish working-class Cassandra 
(‘‘Cassie’s just a professional name”), 
an affectionate, good-natured, frigid, 
occasionally very bitter loser; perpetu- 
ally angry Nathalie, who has worked 
her way up from even lower to gov- 
ernment training she will never now 
have, determined that if she must suf- 
fer, so must everyone else; young 
Alan, a muscular stupe who doesn’t 
even stay polite, innocent though he 
be; Lori Graham, the twelve-year-old 



adopted daughter of the Grahams, who 
is the only black (‘‘Very North Ameri- 
can, aren’t we?”) and has the misfor- 
tune to be allergic to almost every- 
thing; and the nameless narrator (X) 
who has spent an unsatisfying adult- 
hood as a traveling lecturer on music. 
Obsessed with-well, what? you find 
out-she carries a gas-pellet gun, a 
complete pharmacopoeia sewn into her 
clothes (universal currency among 
humans, she says), and compares her- 
self to her ancestors, who escaped 
from a Polish ghetto by moonlight with 
uncut diamonds sewn into their hems, 
or so she likes to imagine. (They prob- 
ably couldn’t afford diamonds.) 

Because there is great danger of in- 
compatible proteins, vitamin deficien- 
cies, mineral poisons, allergens, 
chelating agents, no heat supply, no 
shelter, no knowledge of the length of 
the year (the day is 28 hours long, they 
are in high latitudes and probably ap- 
proaching the summer solstice; this is 
all they know), no stars in the dark 
and empty sky, no knowledge of where 
they are, no chance of rescue, the 
strong possibility of heart disease, le- 
thal genes, infection, a limited gene 
pool, &c., everyone decides to col- 
onize. 

Except X. She wants to die right 
now. She is, or was, a Trembler, that 
is a neo-Christian, and either simul- 
taneously or sequentially a Communist, 
a practitioner of the ars moriendi, or 
art of dying. It’s not popular. 

The group finds water to feed to the 
water-purifier in the shape of a small 
stream, which continues to flow al- 
though there is no rain. They start to 
dig a privy. People discover that they 
do not like other people and that there 
is no law, although public opinion cer- 
tainly exists. Alan gets into a fight with 



86 



GALAXY 



scornful Nathalie and knocks her 
down. Vde and Victor Graham inter- 
fere. Cassie is disgusted; any woman 
who gets into that position, she says, is 
a fool. Lori won’t speak to Alan. Va- 
leria (now lowest on the totem pole be- 
cause of her age and sterility) doesn’t 
care. X has abstracted a screwdriver 
from the communal tool-kit and now 
buries half her drugs (and her gun) at 
the original site so that when the group 
searches her (she’s tipped off in ad- 
vance by Cassie) she won’t be totally 
bereft. Even little Lori, during a card 
game played with pieces of sheeting, 
speaks haughtily of X’s cowardice. X, 
however, is kind enough to tell her for- 
tune, inventing a long life full of fame 
and riches (Lori wants to be a com- 
pose r). At a group meeting in which 
reproductive plans are discussed (“the 
great womb robbery’’ X sourly calls it; 
she’s dictating the whole story secretly 
to her vocoder, usually at night) X 
begs off, saying she wishes to die, but 
the frightened group will not tolerate 
this heresy, although (as they discover) 
it’s difficult to control someone whose 
work you need-they can’t keep her tied 
up, certainly not indefinitely. X slips 
away that night, spraying everyone 
with sleepy-gas, and recovers her gas- 
gun and her cache of drugs. She re- 
turns to sit by the dying Victor (coro- 
nary thrombosis) and endure even 
more bad feeling, especially from 
Nathalie who, although willing to join 
in private laughing at Alan, nonethe- 
less will not tolerate any talk about 
death; “Survival’s the name of the 
game,” she says. X works willingly 
(for example, digging the privy) but 
keeps on talking. Taking her chance, 
she then absconds with the water- 
distiller and the broomstick, moving 
upstream to a cave she finds there, but 



the hitherto inexperienced and rela- 
tively peaceful group comes after her. 

In fact, they try to kill her. 

She shoots John Ude. Necessarily or 
not. She shoots Nathalie. Necessarily 
or not. Alan rushes into the cave and 
bashes his head against the ceiling, 
and she finishes the job with a rock. 
Says Cassie ironically, “You have been 
going it, haven’t you?” and adds 
matter-of-factiy that X’s main mistake 
was in not going far enough away. She 
then grabs at the gas-gun, with an in- 
experienced awkwardness that makes it 
highly dangerous to stop her, and de- 
mands poison. X, outwardly calm, says 
(with real feeling) “I would be very 
pleased to share your company,” but 
Cassie is having none of it; she won’t 
stick around for the rest of her life 
without children or friends; she takes 
the poison, after remarking, “Now you 
can go kill Lori.” 

And X, to whom loneliness has been 
a present torture and unacknowledged 
terror ever since the crash (“Who am / 
writing this for?”) can't go on living 
with the two living people, Lori and 
Valeria Graham. Nor can she face 
them and admit what has happened. 
“I had to go down. Otherwise they 
might have to decide to come up to 
me.” 

So she travels downstream to do 
exactly what Cassie has said. 

* * * 

No STOPS this time. 

I left the broom by the stream and far 
enough away; nobody’s going to steal it 
or break it or hit me over the head with 
it. I slept for a while; it was going to 
start greying-out soon. 1 ate the stuff I’d 
brought with me, a kind of candy bar 
and then something salty you mix with 



WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO.

water and which I’d mixed and carried 
in the plastic wrapping, but that had got 
all over itself and on to my jacket pock- 
et. Supposed to be soup, anyway, not 
paste. I tried to wipe it off with the 
plastic but it was very uncomfortable: 
beginning to go stiff. When it dries, it’ll 
fall off. (Most of it.) 

Then we sit. 

Where is Val? 

There are bushes, trees, the marks of 
feel. I can’t smell the latrine. There are 
long, flattened smudges on the ground 
where things have been dragged. Do I 
remember how to get to the new camp? 

Where’s Cassie? 

It all looks familiar, but then every- 
thing here looks, familiar. Follow the 
water (again). I kept it in sight, trying 
to hide behind bushes. There were more 
footprints, a kind of confused scramble 
and crossing of marks, a place very 
much walked on. 

I saw something white between the 
trees. That’s not a natural color. A little 
closer: someone had lied a sheet to the 
edge of the old bungalow, for a lean-to. 
Very sensible. But there’s nobody 
there. Doesn’t seem to be anyone about. 

Valeria came out of the bungalow, 
flapping a towel in her hands as if to 
dry it or shake crumbs off it. Then she 
hung it on one of the sticks that made 
up the lean-to. She stared into the dis- 
tance, almost as if she’d seen me, then 
turned and went slowly back into the 
bungalow, only to come out again a 
moment later with another towel draped 
over her arm. Oddly: it covered her 
hand. She walked idly forward, looking 
at nothing, short Val, old Val, her hair 
gray at the roots, not in her royal-blue 
sari and her earrings now but in some- 
body’s cast-off khaki trousers and a 
white shirt. The curve of her back near 
the neck is very much exaggerated by 



age; that’s called “dowager’s hump”. 
Nothing balances on the spine quite as 
it used to twenty years before. The op- 
posite posture from what soldiers used 
to do or at least were supposed to do. 

She was perhaps nine meters front 
me, still without purpose, still peering 
about, when I realized she had seen me 
from the first. Must’ve. She was faking. 
The towel dropped and Val Victrix was 
holding a gun. Revolver, I think. She 
walked closer and stopped at twice con- 
versational distance. She looked as if 
she had just noticed me. Then she said: 
“You’re not coming near my child!” 

I said, “It’s all right, Val. The others 
are coming. They’re not using the 
broom because Nat’s got a broken an- 
kle.” 

“Oh, did you give it to her?” she 
said, enjoying herself. “And tell me 
why Nath would walk with a broken 
ankle?” 

“And why they’d trust you alone?” 
she added. It was a revolver, no ques- 
tion. I said quickly: 

“How is Lori? You know how much 
I care about Lori.” 

“I won't let you near her!” 

“All right,” I said. “My goodness.” 
Silence. Mrs. Graham is running out 
of melodramatic things to say. After a 
moment she remarked, “This has still 
got all its bullets, you know,' sixteen of 
them,” so if she were lying I might gel 
her to use up the ammunition, but then 
again she might use it up in me. 

She said, “When we took Lori from 
the creche, she was such a little thing. 
And so beautiful, so tiny, but you 
wouldn’t know that. You wouldn’t 
know anything. No one does, not even 
my husband. That’s right, even Victor. 
And you don’t know how to live, my 
girl, you really don’t. Take it from one 
who does.” 



GALAXY 



“Who hid that gun? Whose gun is it?” 
“It’s tragic to think,” said Mrs. Gee 
cheerfully, and by this I deduced that 
power was making her talky, “that 
when we die here, you’ll never have 
lived but I will. Think of that.” 

I thought about it, conscientiously. 
No one has listened to this woman for 
weeks so that thing in her hand is a 
compulsory Ear; it means I must listen 
and she likes that. She went on: 

“How much money do I have?” 

None now, of course. 

“You don’t even know,” (she said 
amused). “Well, I’ll tell you. Six mill a 
month. Eurodollar. That puts me in the 
top one-tenth of one percentile, I be- 
lieve. And I’m in the credit economy, 
too — I’m not a civilian, you know, not 
legally — and with a credit-level-one you 
can have anything you want in this 
world, anything at all.” 

This world? Goodness! 

“Clothes? No!’’ (she went on) 
“Food? Service? No! That’s just ordi- 
nary life. You grubby little people think 
‘Mrs. Graham’ is foolish, don’t you? 
And maybe you think it’s foolish and 
strange and rich to buy a man and 
strange and foolish and rich to buy a 
child, but one gets sick of renting 
people and even sicker of renting 
pets — it’s dull — and I don’t enjoy poli- 
tics and there’s one thing about bought 
people if you’re wise: they stay bought. 
You can’t have it both ways but I can: 
the old and the new.” 

It must be new money. The politesse 
isn’t there. The taking for granted. Or 
has she just gone a little batty these last 
few weeks? She smiled. She said, “My 
friends think I’m quite eccentric, did 
you know that?” 

Then she said, in an altered tone of 
voice, “I didn’t buy Lori for myself, 
you know. I thought I would but it 



didn’t work out like that. She was an 
awfully sick little thing; she needed 
money like mine. That’s why I chose 
her. Well, one reason. Do you know 
how many operations that child’s had? 
She was hooked to a kidney machine 
when I first saw her and she needed a 
heart implant. And dozens of things. 
They said the only things that really 
worked were her central nervous system 
and her skeletal muscles. The surgeon 
said she had actually become im- 
munized against herself in several ways; 
we almost didn’t lick that one. And I 
did it, I did all of it, I paid for it myself 
and every bit of it on P.D. too so she 
wouldn’t have to be there while they 
were doing it to her! Otherwise it would 
have killed her. Even so I think it might 
have had some bad effects; psychic dis- 
placement can play hell with the mind if 
you’re not careful. A sort of backlash, 
they say. But we had the best, the very 
best.” She laughed. “That child cost as 
much money as a small New England 
state. Believe it. I don’t quarrel with 
Cass, but to have a baby and call your- 
self a mother — ! One doesn’t say such 
things, of course. One doesn’t quarrel. 
Not here. But having children ..." 

She looked at me, quite scornful and 
very happy, still holding the gun. She 
said: 

“Victor fell in love with her. That 
was a good thing, of course. A sick 
child — well, it does something to you. 
To have her around. After a while. I 
love her too. It gets to you, you 
know.” 

“Of course,” I said. 

She said, “I did it. I am the real 
mother here.” Then she said, “That’s 
all I’m going to tell you about myself. I 
don’t think you’d understand the rest. 
It’s very odd for me to be here with all 
of you, but of course one tries to make

do. To be polite. And of course you’ll 
tell no one what I’ve told you.” 

Of course not,” I said, immensely re- 
lieved. 

“Because I shall kill you right now,” 
said Valeria Graham. 

As if on cue, from back in the bun- 
galow, came *a faint “ Motherrrrr /” — 
but this ghastly screech, which we 
should not have been able to hear at all, 
is merely Lori’s I-mean-business voice, 
the voice of a handsome tarsier or a 
pretty macaque monkey possessed by 
demons. Such an expensive life. Smil- 
ing tenderly (and just a little self- 
consciously dramatically) Valeria 
Graham motioned me away from the 
bungalow and further into the trees. She 
put the forefinger of her free hand to 
her lips. Lori must not hear it. Lori 
must not find the body. We all know 
that child’s preternatural hearing. Val is 
too close to me. I fell to the ground, 
roaring ‘Lori! Help! Lori! Help!” and 
trying to roll towards the mother. 
There’s a shot blam\ in here some- 
where, and I can't hear a thing, 
deafened, grabbing her ankles only I 
haven’t got proper leverage and she 
won’t fall all the way down. She gets 
on her knees, steadying herself with one 
hand, and points the gun a hand’s- width 
from my face, happily , ready to shoot 
me. 

I grabbed the barrel and snapped it 
around so the gun was pointing at Mrs. 
Graham’s white shirt — she didn’t seem 
to understand that you must hold a gun 
rigidly, like an extension of your 
arm — and either the motion pulled the 
trigger or she pulled the trigger or 
something pulled the trigger or at any 
rate the little machine went off again. 

She collapsed slowly sideways with 
only a very little blood in the front, A 
big slug like that makes one jump, first. 



Odd thing to see. They must’ve left the 
gun with her, for protection. 

She never fired a gun before in her 
life. 

Dead. Or near it. The revolver fallen 
on the ground. I picked it up and ran 
towards the bungalow. Lori is going 
from screeching to downright squealing; 
this is her you-must-attend-to-me-right- 
away-or-else voice. I sprinted the last 
few meters and fetched up breathless 
against the bungalow doorway. Couldn’t 
see a thing at first and then even when I 
could there was no Lori, only an odd, 
dark shape showing on one of the 
bunks. 

It was her back. 

She was sitting up in the bunk, 
wrapped in one of her Mommy’s royal- 
blue-and-gold saris, with Mommy’s card 
deck made-from-sheets more or less on 
her knees and (I think) on the bed around 
her. Her legs were crossed. She leaned 
forward, putting one card on top of 
another somewhere in her lap. She said: 

“I’m not coming outside; I don’t care 
it if is healthy.” 

You must not shoot a Lori with a 
large-caliber revolver. It’s not right. I 
shifted Mrs. Gee’s gun to my left hand 
but quietly, quietly. You must not shoot 
an ebony-haired Lori. 

“Hello,” I said. 

That impossible child did not even 
turn around. She only said: 

“What an awful noise! What were 
you doing?” 

“Target practice,” I said. 

“I wish you’d shoot Mother,” said 
the Lori absently. There was a mo- 
ment’s silence. Then she added, 
“Mother keeps telling me I must be 
careful. Careful, careful. I’m tired of 
being careful. I think Mother is over- 
protective. Don’t you agree?” 

“No,” I said.

“Oh, go away,” said the Lori, 
"you’re revolting” and she put a card 
on another card. I shot her in the back 
of the head. Did it with the gas gun, 
shrugging it from my sleeve, practically 
touching her hair. There is a kind of 
swooshing sound as the bullet explodes 
within. She slumped forward to one 
side, against the wall, her crossed legs 
keeping her half-upright. I thought I 
might gather up the cards and take them 
with me, but I didn't. No reason to, af- 
ter all. 

Felt nothing. 

. Odd, to feel nothing. 

She might want the cards back. She 
might come for them. 

I went outside and sat, thinking. 
Woke near dawn. It was like the first 
time I’d fled — only then they were all 
alive — and the problem was, what about 
the water-cycler? I mean this is what I 
had thought, under that awful heaven, 
more than a little dazed, trying to move 
about in the near-dark and not step on 
anyone — 1 mean didn’t I have a moral 
right to take the water-cycler because 
they were trying to colonize, which 
would require them to drink the water 
raw, and here all I wanted was to starve 
comfortably to death? But they would 
be awfully mad if I took it, which 
might send them after me, though they 
might come after me anyway, and I 
could leave a note on playing cards: 
Will send broomstick back walking 
speed — but that’ll give them my direc- 
tion if this place has a magnetic field to 
make the compass gyro work and if not 
it’ll get joggled and move off some- 
where else. Or I could leave a sketch of 
a still: Ord. wood fire deform plastic 
tumblers, water in here (arrow). It 
wouldn't be poisonous. We’d been us- 
ing boiling water in the tumblers over 
and over again. 



I had thought a great deal about these 
things that night, on my knees, staring 
straight ahead, probably having breathed 
in some of the sleepygas I had puffed at 
the others. Very vague in the head. It 
occurred to me (then) that I could hold 
the water-cycler in my lap, but I would 
first have to unscrew the coupling to the 
storage tank; so I did and sat with the 
cycler in my lap on the broomstick, and 
fastened my belt around the cycler. Just 
fitted. (Now.) 

Which was the first trip. What you 
might call a rehearsal for the second. 
Much like the second. 

Find the broom, stumbling in the 
dark, water-cycler cradled in one arm, 
harder this time because it’s upstream, 
put on the dust-mask, flip Go and Rise, 
make the little toggles all Manual, and 
point Polewards. Silly to say North. 
Swing round, sending dust over every- 
thing (is it dryer than it was before?) 
and make a broad loop towards the 
Equator; you want to find bare rock be- 
cause the mask is getting clogged and 
this time no forced-draught mist from 
the river, either. Over the hills and 
through the woods, dead dark blots 
against the ordinary darkness; these 
must be trees. (The first time I went 
carefully Equator-wards over the hill 
Victor had died on.) An old, old tune 
through mv head, pre-Modem music: 
We're off 
We’re off 

We’re off in a motor car! 

There’s fifty coppers 
After us 

And we don't know where we 
are! 

How extraordinarily silly. Yet the 
first time there’d been joy in it. I went 
slowly at first, on account of the dark, 
and the cycler pushing its angles into 
me in the very worst places. The broom 



WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO.

was going perhaps twenty-three kph. 
Nothing about the countryside changed 
and I was afraid I’d get lost because I 
wasn’t riding right over the water (like 
the first time) so I turned left, refasten- 
ing my belt around the cycler (this 
time). 

Then I waited (Both times. The first 
time I made a great loop Equator- wards, to 
find bare rock, not to leave a trail.) 

One does see, really, in the dark. If 
you wait long enough. Not real dark, 
underground dark. But even in a bare 
night you can see if you wait long 
enough. Just don’t look directly at 
things. You can even tell water from 
non- water. 

So I knew it must be dawn. And 
speeded up a little — which lifted me a 
little, though it never goes far, not 
much above knee-high — and knew I 
was going towards the Pole, which is 
the opposite way from The Smudge this 
time of night. And when I realized it 
was indeed that greyish, crepuscular, 
eye-swarming, can’t-see time, I checked 
the switches on the broom to make sure 
I had done it properly by feel the first 
time (both times). 

The first time I had had the brilliant 
idea of riding over the water itself, fol- 
lowing the stream up to wherever it be- 
gan, for I would have to have water, 
and though the ground-effect makes a 
sort of immense trough in the water (a 
mist-shower which wets you all over 
and you have to take off your shoes and 
roll up your clothes to your knees; still 
it’s like riding in air-and-water mixed) 
the second time I followed by the side 
of the stream and evened out a lot of 
the windings by staying on the rising 
bank because it didn't matter. I dragged 
my legs in the brush. And so on. And 
on. Endless twilight. Things swimming 
about greyly, like riding through an 

92 



aquarium. Water to the eye. It got chil- 
lier and chillier. I’ve kept my watch; it 
can’t tell time in the usual sense be- 
cause one really doesn’t give a damn 
about the standard day, but there are 
other uses: timing one’s pulse, the 
length of the day, even the fuming of 
the stars. 

Aren’t any. (Only planets.) 

Ah yes, there’s one. I saw it prepare 
endlessly to rise; everything grew more 
distinct (but was all the same coun- 
tryside; little hills, brushy scrub, low 
trees) and after many hours, which I did 
not bother to time, and after I dozed, 
for I don’t remember when the color 
came back to things, I saw our single 
star — I mean our sun — rise slowly but 
very visibly because at these latitudes 
its track around the sky is so low that it 
rises perceptibly sideways. 

It got warmer. 

The first time I’d pushed myself; sec- 
ond time no reason. I stopped whenever 
I began to nod. I stopped to relieve my- 
self. I just stopped. Wading in the 
stream, sun dries your feet afterwards. 
Just sitting. Even without that prepos- 
terous object in my lap with its 
cubical-but-too-many comers balancing 
act, one’s bottom hurts, eventually, and 
one's back; it took hours and hours. All 
times the light was the same, the sun at 
the same height in the sky always; there 
were no bird sounds, no insect sounds, 
no animal sounds; it’s all the same al- 
ways, only around the rim of this 
enormous stage-set there is a spotlight 
that swings slowly around to my back. 

The stream got deeper. The coun- 
tryside got a little dryer and rockier. 

And how I liked it! I haven’t moved 
this fast in a long time. It unwinds like 
a highway, faster than funicular, faster 
than a bicycle, almost as fast as an elec- 
tric car, it’s like walking effortlessly, 



GALAXY 



gliding on someone else’s feet, like 
museum exhibits in which you sit in an 
armchair and are carried effortlessly 
past miniatures of subterranean cities, 
underwater farms, the interiors of fusion 
plants, the lunar mountains, obser- 
vatories and colonies on Mars, on. the 
solar planets, among the asteroids, even 
alien landscapes, imaginary landscapes. 

Even. 

* * * 

Well, it was pretty. It was pretty 
enough. It got rockier and more hilly. 
The ground sprouted patches of some- 
thing new that eventually joined into a 
complete ground-cover; tangles and 
barbs like blackberry brambles (which 
meant I had to wear my shoes) and the 
right-hand bank of the stream got higher 
and higher. The stream grew narrower 
and deeper. As I said, it was like going 
from the hills of an ancient flood-plain 
(roundish and low, not the sharp crum- 
ple of a rock layer pushed up from be- 
low) into glacial debris and glacial 
scaur; what this is, really, is an old 
garbage-heap which the glaciers pushed 
in front of them like a land-scow and 
then left behind. 

I say it resembles this. 

But pretty. Very pretty. Water started 
to come down from here and there on 
the high bank, streamlets big as a An- 
ger, mere drip-drops, mistfalls that 
evaporated halfway to the surface of the 
river — these can’t be rain-fed, not 
here — and the first and second time I 
was making silly pictures in my mind of 
jungled and trellised interior pipes, real 
ones of metal or baked porcelain (with 
flanges) which had been broken up by 
the glaciers and that was why the water 
began indignantly seeping to the surface 
or springing up here and there. The air 



was very dry, though, all the same. 
There ought to be monkeys, orchids, 
brilliant birds, canoes full of native 
heroes. Both times I turned aside at a 
fairly big waterfall-let, maybe three fin- 
gers across, and steered with difficulty 
up the steep bank (the stick turns over if 
you try to send it up a too- steep grade). 

This is my cave. Nice things: mat- 
tress, little bisecting stream, metal box, 
extra underwear, some food, the vo- 
coder. And so on. Very nice. 

Well, I told you all about that. 

Inside is something very unpleasant, 
unless he’s got up and walked away. 

Oh, he hasn’t. 

I really didn’t want to go in. I don’t 
mean anything rational; it just kept turn- 
ing me away. 

I said, “Look here, it’s my cave. 
You get out.” 

He was so dead. Like a statue: cold 
as marble but made of rubber and ev- 
erything stiff and at strange angles, with 
this Godawful picture of death im- 
printed on it. I can’t say I cared to look 
at him. And had to clean the cave floor, 
too. 

The broom will never hold us both; 
he’s too heavy. He’s taking up a lot of 
room in my home, besides, and that’s 
irritating. So finally I strapped him on 
the broom with my belt and tied him 
on, too, with strips of sheeting, and 
pointed the whole mess over the edge of 
the bank. The broomstick rolled end 
over end down the bank — I was afraid it 
would catch in a sidewise position and 
just lie there, pushing — but it wobbled 
upright like a live thing when it reached 
flatter ground (I thought I might have to 
go fix it) and began to ascend the other 
bank, a little drunkenly. His legs were 
catching in underbrush and making the 
thing jerk. But it smoothed out when it 
hit flat ground and up the hill and over

the top, smoothly and efficiently, the 
way it’s supposed to, and unless Alan- 
Bobby falls off (can’t hold on; he’s 
dead) it’s off for a jaunt around the 
world, in the opposite direction to the 
sun. 

So if Alan-Bobby is going West, then 
the sun is rising in the West and setting 
in the East or we are really near the 
South pole and not the North pole and 
he's going East and the sun’s going 
East-to-West. 

Only names, only names. 

On the way up 1 saw, lying among 
the bushes, Cassie’s white peplum. I 
think Cassie was inside it. 

Oh, yes, l forgo! to tell you. 

I know she was; 1 saw her. Wanted 
to circle around her and didn’t. She was 
lying on her back, limbs a little 
sprawled, staring at the sun and some- 
thing uncharacteristic in the air (for 
there are few breezes here) was moving 
some strands of her hair up and forward 
over her face, up and forward, over and 
over again. I’ve seen people who died 
using that stuff; they usually lie down 
and are happy long before the end. I 
wondered what would’ve happened to 
her if. 

Please, I'd like to take another flight; 
this one doesn’t fit my tour. Can’t I 
have another flight? I want to get my 
hair done at the hotel. 

Alan-Bobby has gone to see the 
world. Lori is playing cards in Heaven. 
I’m not alone yet, but when the broom 
wears out and crashes (where?), when 
he falls off, when the bodies rot with 
their own internal bacteria, when 
they’re all gone, when Lori is dust and 
Valeria earth, when Alan-Bobby moul- 
ders and sinks into some other conti- 
nent, when Nathalie and John are bones 
in water and then air and then nothing, 
then I’ll be alone. When Cassie is only 



a white flag, a shred of artificial silk, 
bits of sheeting abraded to powder and 
sunk into the ground, a few fibers 
slowly settling into the ground around 
the roots of plants. 

Then I’ll be alone. 

I’m alone. 

# * * 

Now I’ll tell you about the first time. 
My four or five good days. When I 
woke up my watch had stopped; I must 
have slept long. It’s the old-fashioned 
kind that winds itself up by the move- 
ments of your arm, which means that 
once a month you shake your arm vig- 
orously, but I think the water had got to 
it. Ah, why didn’t you buy one with a 
sealed power-source, as everyone told 
you to? (Because they’re expensive.) 
Not that it mattered. I made a sun-dial 
from a thing like a twig, just stuck it in 
a patch of bare ground out in front of 
the cave. I’d fallen asleep before I’d 
marked where the sun went down (and 
comes up); so I had no landmark for it. 

. thing like a twig. 

They’re succulents. This was a 
shock. I went out very carefully from 
the cave because I didn’t want to fall 
and break some part of me as I’m very 
likely to do because my footing is never 
very good. I scrambled up the slope 
outside, trying not to touch anything in 
the rubbish. They looked like the 
downstream trees; low, silvery, a sort of 
grey-green. The “silvery” was probably 
hairs, like a cactus. I don’t think any of 
us ever noticed. Succulents are water- 
conservers; they’re relatives of cacti, 
and that should mean there’s going to 
be a very hot summer. Or a very long 
summer. Or a dry summer. Or no win- 
ter.

GALAXY 



What do these trees do in winter? 

Answer: they walk to the Equator. 
Well, maybe they do. This is not in the 
least like New Jersey. I used to have a 
potted plant called Hen and Chickens, a 
little pot of it, and they felt just like 
this: tough, elastic pillows. But these 
are much flatter. There’s no join be- 
tween stem and branch, as if they didn’t 
ever fall off the way deciduous leaves 
do, though from a short distance away 
they look wonderfully alike. I thought 
to myself that I should not touch 
anything — allergic poisons? Just plain 
poisons? No way to tell. 

The light may be turning them grey, 
except at sunrise or sunset. It’s a pale, 
whitish, Northern sunlight, the way I 
remember North Canada. Oddly wintry 
for such an outwardly amiable place; 
during the day the light is winter and 
plants are tropical but it’s dry, very dry; 
this does in a mild, subtle, discordant 
way what the night sky — which I am 
going to be careful never to see 
again — does so horribly, so insistently. 

I don’t want to look at The Smudge 
ever again. 

From inside the cave one can see the 
ledge stretching about a meter to the 
edge of the cliff and then the lower 
bank, some twenty meters away, and 
more low, irregular hills beyond, close 
enough to enact a very satisfactory im- 
itation of mountains. Deal with things a 
little at a tim6. It’s a pretty landscape. 
An imitation or remembrance of moun- 
tains. 

One thing at a time. 

I went out and sat on the edge of the 
cliff, my feet dangling, chucking stones 
into the river. If 1 were a geologist (I 
mean a planetologist) I might’ve known 
what kind they were. There are no 
traces on either bank of the river’s ever 
having been higher than it is now, so 



either it was at its height now and 
would go down later or it would never 
go down. Which is odd, when you 
think of the succulents. (Which grow 
right down to the bank and did 
downstream, too, as far as I remem- 
bered.) Which should be storing water 
but they’re flat. Therefore they aren’t 
storing water, at least not yet. So the 
river will rise or it’ll rain or something 
before they stoke up for the drought. 
But the river’s never been higher. So it 
won’t ever rise. So the succulents don’t 
know what they’re doing. 

I went back inside and arranged my 
calendar: a cleared place with one peb- 
ble squat! on the earth. Day One. Sim- 
ple. I set up the water-cycler in the 
back of the cave, where the stream 
comes out of the rocks and I had a jolly 
time getting the tripod level. Then took 
the clothes out of the metal box and put 
my extra clothes on top, and the soap, 
and the food. Just a pair of shorts and a 
shirt, really, and an all-over undie. Had 
a fit of the giggles (Elaine On Desert 
Island — of which there are none on 
Earth that do not contain resort 
hotels — her 3-D viewer, her burning- 
glass, her resourcefulness, ages eight to 
twelve.) I had to stay up until sunset so I 
could mark where senset was — and 
wouldn’t you know the blasted astronomi- 
cal event happened right in back of the 
cave? So I had to climb the hill to get a 
decent look at it; it was either that or back 
right off the ledge. Then I ducked inside 
and went to sleep really quick. I didn’t 
start a fire with my lighter, no need, 
though Elaine had a pocket lighter. 
(Would’ve probably burned myself up.) It 
was my little apartment. My little hotel. I 
had a dream full of echoes; I was standing 
alone on an empty stage, under one spot- 
light, singing with immense power and 
elan: 



WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO.

When I'm calling yoo-hoo-hoo-hoo- 
hoo-hoo-hoo 

* * * 

There was Pebble Two after Pebble 
One. When the sun was over a particu- 
lar fold in the. hills, marked also by a 
tree on the opposite bank, I put a peb- 
ble down. It’s midday. In this thirty- 
hour (?) day I sleep twice, once through 
the dusk, the night, the dawn, once in 
the middle of the afternoon. It suits. I 
like watching my little amphitheatre 
change, the shadows wheel obediently 
around the trees, the sundial reach 270 
degrees (or thereabouts), everything be- 
gin to turn orange. I slept a lot and sang 
a lot, the first time. I knew I wouldn’t 
sleep more than ten hours a night, more 
than two or three hours in the day. I 
never used to have sleep enough, al- 
ways had to get up for something-or- 
other, I could never sleep long enough. 
Dreadful mornings shivering and cold, 
hours and hours to real waking time. 
Evenings when I lay in bed wakeful and 
desperate. I always wanted to sleep til 
noon, sleep til one, then get up and find 
it morning. Now I do. No standard time 
here. The sun was no lower, the place it 
rose and the place it set no farther 
apart. Pebble Three. Pebble Four. 

Maybe it takes years for the summer 
solstice here. 

Which was when I lost track. 

* * * 

Second time, I had to clean up, 
gather dried blood clinging-to-dirt in my 
extra shirt and throw it over the ledge. 
Put the mattress back where it’d been, 
put the water-recycler back up. The first 
time I came here I said out loud, “I’m 
alone!” but the second time makes this 



a very crowded little cave. Nothing to 
do about it, only wait; they’ll fade; 
they’ll go away. I felt like an interior 
decorator the first time, such glee; 

(Why didn’t I go back and circle 
around Cassie? Didn’t, though. Now I 
want to go back.) 

One thing at a time. 

I re-set my calendar. Filled the 
water-cycler again from the little 
stream in the cave; then put my shorts, 
my shirt, my all-over undie in a corner, 
folded up. Very neat. Pulled the mat- 
tress about and took some pebbles out 
from under it. I’ll leave the other rocks 
and pebbles — I’ll have to do something 
with them later. Boring otherwise. 

And I talked all this out into the vo- 
corder, ate, defecated into the stream 
(which lakes an hour or so, busily run- 
ning, to deal with it), woke, dozed, 
slept a lot. Fell asleep in the afternoon 
and had a long, inconclusive dream 
about Alan-Bobby in which he came back 
(in the dream) and we had a fight or 
anyway something was very boring and 
very wrong. Woke up stiff. The mat- 
tress feels harder this time. 

I shall be bored to death long before I 
starve. The sun is up longer, if possi- 
ble, or at least no less, and rising and 
setting no farther apart, so maybe it will 
be hotter. The daylight longer. Maybe 
there will be no night at all. I got very 
hungry (food all gone) and I think my 
stomach was preparing to eat itself, but 
if you’ve dieted, you know this quiets 
down after the first few days. I drank a 
lot of water (which I knew I would) and 
it didn't help (as 1 knew it wouldn’t). 
On a diet, you do everything you can to 
keep your spirits up. The neo-Christians 
had a way of coping with boredom by 
meditation but if you do that you’re apt 
to get hallucinations instead. How in- 
teresting.

Just realized: I am fasting like a Des- 
ert Father, so in a few days I’ll have 
hallucinations anyway. It is a driving, 
driving; to get food. 

My cross is gone, you know? my 
cross is gone, my cross is gone, 1 can’t 
wear it, O dammit, dammit, why didn’t 
I keep it? 

Well, let’s get on with it. 

* * * 

It’s boring. So boring. Pebble Three. 
I’ll tell you about the neo-Christians; 
they’re nobody. It was just an intellec- 
tual fad. We used to meet in some- 
body’s attic in graduate school (I was 
thirty, L.B. was thirty-five) until a 
media rep got hold of it and then all of 
a sudden there were neo-Christians 
everywhere, like Amanita mushrooms. 
That’s when I quit. Who wants to sit in 
an attic and argue about Descartes, 
anyway? It was only stealing ideas, but 
I suppose it'll go into the history books 
as “eclectic”. 

History is all fantasy. 

It’s boring. Starving is boring. I just 
went over everything 1 dictated to the 
vocoder, then decided to leave it as it 
was. What’s the use of listening? All 
you hear is your own voice. I ought to 
rig up the machine to wake me in the 
middle of the night and whisper some- 
thing shocking like, “we’re going to get 
you!” In my voice, of course. Would if 
I had the tools. 

1 certainly have the time. 

It is so boring that 1 am here and now 
going to write the history of the neo- 
Christian movement, which began with 
a classmate of mine named L.B. Hook 
(he played the tuba) and ended in spec- 
tacular persecutions, martyrs who 
shrieked their faith aloud in the flames, 
no no, we never got the chance, worse 



luck. It ended like everything else, just 
sort of petered out. Like dyeing your 
eyelashes a different color every week 
or regulating all your daily movements 
with a pocket watch according to the 
Leuter system of exercises. Other hob- 
bies. Mixed with Zen, old Christianity, 
vegetarianism, archery, astrology, don’t 
know what. Whatever. 

No, I won’t write it. No reason to. 
I’m sure that — presenting no threat to 
the Powers That Be— it’s amply 
documented somewhere. (Actually I did 
talk out a long history of the whole busi- 
ness, and then erased it. It took up 
perhaps half an hour. Passed the time. 1 
can’t tell now the difference between 
my politics at the time and my love af- 
fairs, between music and economics, or 
economics and metaphysics. I was 
drunk when L.B. and 1 went to the 
jeweler’s to get our crosses made, you 
know, one of those little places that al- 
ways exists; planting the flag of hand- 
made pottery everywhere! The neo- 
Christian symbol was a cross inside a 
circle — that is, a quartered circle — 
which probably comes from some other 
iconography, but we always called it a 
cross. Had an awful time making the 
man understand what we wanted. I kept 
mine in memory of L.B. and getting 
drunk. 

(And my attempting — drunk — to play 
the tuba.) 

* * * 

Dull. Oh God, dull. Trying 
hopelessly to push the sun along. If you 
scream, will that move it? I can’t get 
through the next minute, I know I can’t. 
Count your fingers one way and then 
back (nineteen), assigning them 
metaphysical values or pictures: house, 
book, Byzantine Empire, salvation, or- 
thodoxy, burnt bacon, play, and so on. 



WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO.

Do it backwards; can you remember 
them? Clock watching. Sun watching. 
The sun doesn’t set directly in back of 
the cave but almost downstream. That’s 
why 1 can see it rise. 

I think the rising place and the setting 
place are moving closer together. 

If it move's over that bush, I’ll sur- 
vive. If it hits the edge of that tree, I’ll 
stay sane. Then I can leave work and 
go home. Block out the disc with one 
palm and count: seventy-five pulse beats 
for the bush, a hundred and fifty for the 
tree. If I didn't move my head or my 
hand or my arm and didn’t get excited. 
I marked out elaborate divisions on the 
sun-dial, scratching them in the dirt, 
then threw the biggest rocks to the side 
of the cave. Much tidier. Thought I’d 
save the rest of them so it would leave 
me something to do, then with an ab- 
surd sense of utter defeat, sat down and 
cried. 

I’m not afraid of death but there’s noth- 
ing to do. Nothing, nothing, nothing. 

I wept. 

Had a brilliant idea: to recite all the 
poetry and prose I ever remembered 
into the vocoder, have it print-out. I'll 
have a library. 

Didn’t do it. 

Sat and sat. Stopped being hungry for 
a while. I feel all right except that it’s 
odd to swallow water as if it were food 
and feel that everything’s cleared up, 
somehow, not that anything’s happened 
to my vision. There used to be bulk cel- 
lulose you could buy for starving, i.e. 
dieting, but there’s nothing to buy here. 
The withdrawal symptoms of a buying 
addict. A talking addict. A busy-ness 
addict. The sun says: Sloooooow 
Dooooooown. 

Well, maybe (have to do something 
special to the vocoder to get it to do 
that, above). 



If: 

beef teriyaki 
caramel sauce 
vanilla cream 
frenchfries 
noodles with pork 
bombe glacee 
pressed seaweed sticks 
Salt! 

I forgot salt; I’m going to die for lack 
of salt. 

* * * 

A false alarm, of course. But I gave 
myself a jolt of adrenalin that — you 
know — crying, trembling a lot, walking 
around, wringing the hands — I do carry 
salt with me, for there are places where 
it’s very expensive, not a drug but ter- 
restrial seasalt for gourmets. And 
there’s more back at the bungalow. 
There’s food back there. 

That frightened me. Made me hungry 
for food, even though there are corpses 
back there. And hungry for the com- 
pany back there, too. (That’s not 
exactly clear-headed.) I spread out ev- 
erything I owned, popouts from my 
belt, stuff in the jacket, in my shoe- 
heels, et cetera, and marked in my mind 
what and where, and then put it back. 
Must not, should not, cannot take off 
anything for a moment. Must be with 
me, always. Wished I had the broom. 
Still, I could walk it. Must’ve spent 
about ten minutes taking all those drugs 
out and putting them back again but 1 
couldn’t even get up; I was trembling. 
Heart pounding. Very dizzy. 

Did I put a pebble down? Can’t re- 
member. I put another, which made 
four. Five. Six. Seven Eight. Nine. 
Ten. Eleven. Twelve. I don’t think you 
can die from lack of salt all that fast. 
Looked very nice. I made a circle of 



98 



GALAXY 



them, them scrambled them up, then 
scrabbled about for a whole bunch of 
pebbles, and made on the floor — by lay- 
ing them out neatly and carefully — the 
picture of the quartered circle. 

Too late for exploring. That was the 
idea: no food, no broomstick. You're 
not supposed to change your mind. If I 
lie still for a few minutes my head 
clears and I can talk connectedly, e.g. 
there’s something trying to get into this 
cave or into my head. No, not for real. 
But something. 

Going to sleep now, Nothing will 
change. 

* * * 

Next day, don’t know what day it is. 
Probably five. Who cares. If history 
were not fantasy, then one could ask to 
be remembered but history is fake and 
memories die when you do and only 
God (don’t believe it) remembers. His- 
tory always rewritten. Nobody will find 
this anyway or they’ll have flippers so 
who cares. 

Sign off.

Late afternoon: these were my poli- 
tics: Communism and share-the-work. If 
you can’t tell Communism from 
Swialism, Socialism from Anarchism, 
go away. The theory: a new class, even 
a new economy, developing within our 
mimicry of the old one, big business, 
big government, big labor, and all sci- 
ence, and out of it comes the real pro- 
ducers. A short chain formed from part 
of a long chain that’s doubled back on 
itself. Look carefully or you won’t see 
that much government is little govern- 
ment, much business little business, 
most labor little labor, but all science 
big science. Now. 

The truth is, they don’t need us. 



Will we be killed off eventually as 
simply unnecessary? Or kept as house 
pets? 

* * * 

(Questions: what is “house pets.” 
What is “eventually.” What is “poli- 
tics.” What is “Communism.” What is 
“economy.” What is “mimicry.” What 
is “labor.” What is “business.” What 
is “doubled.” What is “theory.” What 
is “class.” What is “Anarchism.” 
What is “Socialism.” What is “pro- 
ducers.” 

(If you and your flippers get that far.) 

* * * 

Vocoder has made eighteen spaces, 
which 1 erased. If neither alien nor hu- 
man, you’re God. Who already knows. 
So I’m left talking to myself. Which is 
nothing and nobody. 

* * * 

I guess I’d better tell you about my 
politics because you're such nice people 
you might think I did something wrong 
but I didn’t. I got into the Populars at 
about age twenty-six and spent about a 
year talking to University groups and 
various funded groups (these are the 
most vulnerable because the most 
parasitic) until in some inexplicable way 
the tide turned against us (although the 
media had never picked us up) and one 
night I heard a sound from the audience 
that doesn’t need explaining any more 
than the shape of a chicken-hawk to a 
chicken, something I can only describe 
as a growing volume in the infra-bass as 
if the floor were preparing to rise and 
the walls come tumbling down, an 
ominous, slowly-rising roar that has noth- 
ing whatsoever to do with shouting or 



WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO. 



99 



heckling; they’re nothing. I stood listen- 
ing to that fascinating sound until it oc- 
curred to me that they were after 
me — me, who had never harmed 
them! — and then I ran. I sprinted into 
the wings, smiled charmingly at the 
Fund officials (who were trying to grab 
me), twisted jthe pinky finger of one 
lady, stepped hard on the bare instep of 
another gentleman (but smiling, smiling 
all the time), dropped my over-tunic in 
the hall (bright red-and-green, far too 
distinctive), and took the fire-elevator to 
the third sub-basement, thus avoiding a 
long discussion with the fire marshals in 
the lobby in which yod have to say for 
five minutes Gee, I’m sorry, I didn't 
know I wasn’t supposed to do that (then 
you show them your I.D.), found the 
freight elevators locked, and finally 
staggered up three staircases, took an 
ordinary elevator to the street level, and 
walked inconspicuously out of the build- 
ing. Don’t know where all those sudden 
skills came from. It was fun in a way. 
But not the kind of thing you’d want to 
do twice. 

I didn’t even go home for two days 
but when I did, nothing happened. 

Oh the jail, that was later, that was a 
lark. Four neo-Christians talking to 
some incredible aardvark like a real, 
live Civic Improvement Association in a 
city park during a summer windstorm 
that backed up a small, ornamental lake 
and flooded the place. We were rather 
perfunctorily arrested and locked in the 
storage shed used for the carousel in 
wintertime. Place damp and full of old 
picnic tables, which we sat on. And 
sang. And played dominoes. And took 
bets if the water would rise enough to 
float us away. I had to keep my feet on 
the tables because I was the only one 
wearing shoes and when the friendly 
police couple let us out to run to the 



public bathroom (ten meters away) I 
remember taking them off (the shoes) 
and leaving them on a table. Nobody 
touched them. 

I’ve told this story a hundred times 
and people are always impressed and I 
am damned if I know why. 

That enormous building I spoke in (or 
almost got killed in): the interior 
carpet-sprayed and wall-flocked in a 
certain extremely limited range of 
bright, stylized colors, everything flat 
and dry to the touch, neither cold nor 
hot and you can’t smell anything except 
the carpets (if they’re new) or maybe 
the disinfectants blown through the air 
ducts at night. Brochures often describe 
the hologrammic numerals hanging in 
front of the doors in such buildings as 
“softly glowing” — which means they’re 
in the same range of colors as every- 
thing else but the hall is dimmed a little 
so you can see them and they carry the 
intangibleness and non-tactility of the 
place to the point of driving you gaga. 
Books say it. Actors on TV say it. 
Everyone says it except people. 

Yet the style of architecture is a good 
eighty years old. We are trapped in 
somebody’s old dreams of Utopia, 
trapped outside what’s really new. Mod- 
em Baroque is new: think of those non- 
civilian buildings we know nothing 
about: great, opal-streaked globes, each 
with its separate stem, those sixty-four- 
square chessboards you find in Iowa, 
each grid half a mile on a side, 
spaghetti-clusters of transparent tubing 
for private homes of the same stuff, 
twenty times as big, built over rivers or 
waterfalls for factories. Nobody keeps 
us out. Nobody forbids us. You can 
even go in and get yourself a tour — 
only you’ll never learn enough to go 
home and reproduce it yourself. If you 
had the tools. Which you don’t.

My God, how naive we were. If 
somebody tried to bust us up, we 
must’ve been going in the right direc- 
tion. I mean the Pops, the Pops, of 
course, not the other — and I knew it. 
(And the media never even touching 
us!) 

Although the Civic Improvement As- 
sociation was worse (or better?); any- 
way, they still thought they were at the 
center. You have to think that or die. 
Either you limit what you think about 
and who you think about (the com- 
monest method) or you start raising a 
ruckus about being outside and wanting 
to get inside (then they try to kill you) 
or you say piously that God puts every- 
body in the inside (then they love you) 
or you become crazed in some way. 
Not insane but flawed deep down 
somehow, like a badly-fired pot that 
breaks when you take it out of the kiln 
and the cold air hits it. Desperate. 

So I said Hey, if you’re going to 
send mobs against me, I’ll change what 
I say; I'll say God puts everybody on 
the inside — and anyway it’s true and 
one must believe it — and I zipped like 
lightning back to the edge of the board. 
The music (which I like) and the audi- 
ences (which I don’t) and the catching 
cold (run out of Interferogen) and the 
too-much reading when I travel (be- 
cause I’m bored) and the paid corps of 
nitwits who travel one day ahead of me 
so they can ask the identical, stupid 
questions over and over, meanwhile (in 
between lectures) frantically changing 
their height, their weight, their coloring, 
their faces, and their voices — everything 
but their minds. 

Far, far away from the cutting edge 
of change. 

God knows I’m private now. And on 
the periphery now. As far from any- 
thing as one can get. Outside the out- 



side of the outside. 

I dozed and dreamed. Thought I’d 
got my period. But I seem to have gone 
anestric, way off my regular schedule. 
First time in my life. I guess I’m al- 
ready too skinny; I’ll be amenorrheic 
forever. 

A cheap vocoder could not spell that: 
“amenorrheic.” 

* * * 

I’ve thought this through a hundred 
times; was going to erase it. Didn’t, 
though. 

The sun’s moved. 

A blessing. 

* * * 

Morning. Dreamed near waking, 
something very confused and vivid. It 
was about catching cold, but I don’t 
remember what the cold was supposed 
to be. Ears ringing with solitude. It’s so 
quiet that I seem to be at the center of a 
noise-factory; gurgling innards, bellows 
in my chest, all sorts of scraping and 
scratching of skin against clothes or 
pebbles moving. Even one knee that 
clicks, I swear. 

It's hotter. Though I should be put- 
ting out less heat because of not eating. 
There was a thermometer back in the 
bungalow. 

No. Sit still. 

The old monks; “Sit in thy cell and 
thy cell will teach thee all things.” 
Helps if you’ve got a cell in the middle 
of downtown San Francisco. 

I feel a reluctance to speak into this 
machine. Because something is leaning 
over my shoulder. Is in here with me 
now. Is at the door. Is coming in. Is 
outside the cave. Which probably means 
I’m starting to go bananas. 



WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO.

Rest. For a while. 

★ * * 

Well, I still can’t think of death 
properly, can I, though I worked for 
more than a j>ear in the terminal coun- 
seling end of a hospital in San Francis- 
co. I mean death is what happens in a 
hospital, nobody just dies, for good- 
ness’ sakes, and if you want death 
there’s no sense getting ready for it 
anywhere else than a hospital because 
you won’! get it. You have to order it, 
like a special diet. And pray for it. And 
take medication for it. And consult with 
your doctors about it. And be in a hos- 
pital bed. Which is nonsense. 

Wish I’d gotten rid of the food back 
at the bungalow. 

(I tried to get up and my head swam; 
everything whirled.) 

Anyway it’s not so bad because the 
worst kind I ever saw were those whose 
lives had gone long before their bodies. 
The useless people. Screaming, “I 
don’t want to die, I don’t want to die!” 
the way children still scream at the al- 
lergist’s, sometimes, having whispered 
to each other long, ancient, horror 
stories about “needles” (allergists don’t 
use them). Clinging to money and 
power because there’s nothing else. (A 
five-year-old boy screaming himself 
blue in the Allergy Room with everyone 
standing patiently at least two meters 
from him. He had shut his eyes in con- 
vulsive stubbornness; then I saw a doc- 
tor say, “All right, Stevie, we won’t do 
it,” and give him the shot. Opened his 
eyes and cried, “All right. Do it! Do it 
now!”) The number of old hands I’ve 
held, saying: Dying is a task. (One wit 
answered, “Come and join me, then.”) 

Hello. Hello, old wit. 



It never moves in stranger ways than 
when It moves inside us. 

There’ll be hallucinations about being 
rescued, I know: croaking thinly, “no, 
let me die!” (with immense dignity, of 
course) and I’m carried out to a 
shuttlecraft by great, coarse, strong, 
disgustingly healthy people in uniforms 
with thick necks. Actually it would be a 
little awkward trying to explain what 
happened to the others. 

You killed them. Why? 

They were trying to kill me. 

Why? 

To prevent me. 

From doing what? 

Dying. 

A shadow at the mouth of the cave. 
Wasn’t. My mistake. I can’t have gone 
hungry that long, it’s only a few days; 
must be spooking myself. 

Sleep some more. 

* * * 

I know, I know. I’m an awful stupe. 
We all knew, really. If the media ig- 
nored something as big as the Pops (and 
other such, as I found out later) it 
wasn’t because we were dull; it’s be- 
cause we were dangerous. They would 
have publicized a miniature Sheboygan 
World Trade Tower rnade out of waffles 
and they did. Mind you, there doesn’t 
have to be that much of a conspiracy if 
your social reflexes are automatic 
enough. Then I asked' a friend to drift 
past the building where I’d (not) spoken 
and she said there was God’s own 
amount of repair material going up to 
the forty-third floor: women with 
carpet-sprayers’ guns, men with the 
other rig for the walls, bales of sheet 
plastic that you use to cover things you 
don’t want colored, plyboard, furniture, 
even packages of searchlight lenses

flown down on to the roof. My, my, 
my! And not a word of it anywhere. 
Now that’s real censorship. 

That’s when I cut out. With no 
qualms. 

I know, religion vs. politics (q.v.) the 
whole bit: saving people retail is O.K. 
but don’t do it wholesale. My one orig- 
inal contribution to the whole business 
was a graffito that nobody would use al- 
though I thought it rather zippy myself: 
"Money doesn't matter whenIControl is 
somewhere else!" (Although I saw it in 
the Auckland underground station years 
later so maybe it got somewhere. Or 
occurred to someone else, which isn’t 
unlikely.) 

I knew all those things. But never in 
my life did I make such an absolute, in- 
flexible, and somehow automatic deci- 
sion. And stuck to it even though it 
wasn’t (in some curious way) mine at 
all. I wasn't angry. 1 wasn’t even 
afraid. I was, in fact, in some odd way, 
rather pleased with myself. 1 knew, of 
course, that the tide turning against us 
wasn’t “inexplicable” but I didn’t care 
as the others did; 1 only wondered how 
they did it, exactly. And who “they” 
were. And admired them. And thought 
I’d like to meet them, if I could, and 
find out what they were really up to. 

Never will, of course. 

And what will neo-Christianity do in 
the future? Will it mean anything? That 
does bother me. 

It’s a bore, a dreadful bore, being 
outside history. 

* * * 

Day Something. Dreams about Cas- 
sie. I woke up and actually saw her 
stand at the door of the cave. Then she 
vanished; 1 mean became again the pat- 
terns of rock and sun-spots-in-my-eyes 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO. 



I’d been making her out of. Hallucina- 
tions aren’t just “seeing something”; 
they’re a special case of perception in 
which you work a little harder, that’s 
all. 

Cassie. Every mind is its own galaxy. 
If I told Cassie I had wanted to be in- 
side History, she’d say, “Oh, so you 
want to be important, do you?” I’m an 
awful snob. I must move around. Only 
starve to death a little sooner, that’s all, 
but this sedentariness is enough to make 
you sick by itself. For a moment I had 
a violent craving for the broomstick, 
anything, car, helicopter, G.E.V., 
monorail, anything that lets you move, 
move, move. I’ll go out; breaking a leg 
doesn’t matter because it’ll just speed 
things up. I can go out on my own front 
porch anyway, I should hope to kiss a 
pig. If I hold on to the wall 
Cassie. Go. Away. Please? 

I’ll be seeing her all day now, in 
flashes, out of the corner of my eye. 
She’s very polite. She went away. 

I know you are wondering by now 
how I can do so much and keep talking 
all the time; what I have done is to tie a 
strip of cloth through the hook on the 
vocoder and hang the vocoder around 
my neck. It goes with me. So I will go 
out on the cave porch with it, and sit on 
the edge of the ledge and get the gig- 
gles about falling. This is it: 

There is a low and impossible sun in 
the painted backdrop of the sky. So 
bleak. So empty. Might as well be un- 
real if I can’t get into it. The color is as 
strange as anything I’ve ever seen, 
though part of that must be the light: 
pale. Northern sunlight that slides down 
these equivocal stems of what aren’t re- 
ally bushes — or trees — and ought to be 
somewhere in Death Valley National 
Park anyway, not within the Arctic Cir- 
cle. River-noise is clear now (somebody 

103 



behind the scenes just turned up a 
switch and thank you very much). 

I like this place. It’s nice. 

I know Cassie is an hallucination be- 
cause she doesn’t move, just appears for 
an instant in that attitude in which I saw 
her last (arms and legs sprawled, staring 
straight up) but she appears vertically 
instead of horizontally because that’s 
how she was in my field of vision then 
because I was looking at her from 
above. She’s like a portable cut-out. 

Hallucinations can be memories, too. 
If I tried I could hear in the noise of the 
river the sound of the rain on the old 
carousel shed in the park; I could invent 
the sound of a door slamming shut 
somewhere from time to time, irregular- 
ly, as the wind whipped about. (I tried 
to drink from out of an unboarded 
window and got my shoes wet in the 
puddle that’s blown in under it.) Or the 
sound of the audience that was going to 
kill me — you can’t get that from actors, 
you know; it’s inimitable — that one’s 
easy if you start with the noise of 
river-water. Something very similar 
about the echoes, the undertones, the 
simultaneity of sources. I remember 
quite vividly standing on the platform 
and being able to see nothing but the 
light cage in the back of the hall, won- 
dering if the bored-looking person in it 
would turn the lights off me and on to 
the audience because if you do that, 
they can sometimes be diverted into 
smashing the lights, at least for a while. 
But I guess he was paid not to. (Though 
they broke a lot of glassware anyway; at 
least the lenses were being replaced 
wholesale a day later.) 1 said, smiling, 
“I’m not the speaker” — or at least I 
became aware that I was in the middle 
of saying it — and then the floor of the 
room started to rise with the sheer vol- 
ume of the sound and I walked off. 



Don’t know what happened to my 
friends. 

Did the Pops start as three people in 
an attic? By the time it got to us it was 
a traveling symposium, which shows 
you it was past that stage or maybe was 
never in it, though some of the speakers 
were — God knows — bad enough to be 
idealistic amateurs. 

Another graffito: “I have just lost all 
my fingers tolThe cutting edge of 
change. 

I must’ve been the smallest minnow 
ever to slip through that kind of a net. 
If there was a net. When there's no real 
organization you don’t need to catch 
anybody; just scare them sufficiently 
and the whole thing dissolves back into 
individuals. 

No, Cassie. No. No. No. Go away. 

She moved. She’ll be talking next. 

* * * 

Thought I’d go down to the 
bungalow — surely I could find my way 
there and back, just follow the river— 
but I don’t walk very well. It's a long 
way up to get up. Or something. Any- 
way, I got hideously light-headed, 
probably from having spent so much 
time sitting down. I will probably gel 
scurvy or an ulcer. Cassie and I had a 
long talk (which I know is imaginary). 

I don’t remember a thing about it. 

* * * 

Things are for the best and if they 
aren’t I certainly am not going to make 
a fuss about it. Not now. Like the time 
I was under anesthesia for a tooth im- 
plant and kept murmuring dreamily to 
myself, “I don’t care what you do to 
Me as long as / am not here.” (Which 
came out, they tell me, as something

like ”f. .ff. .ff. .”) It was 
such a relief. Then you come to, spit- 
ting blood and sick to your stomach. 

Guess 1 really am starving. But not 
apathetic enough (yet) to stop talking. 
Never will, I guess. Everything’s being 
sublimed into voice, sacrificed for 
voice; my voice will live on years and 
years after I die, thus proving that the 
rest of me was faintly comic at best, 
perhaps impossible, just an organic back- 
up for conversation. Marvelous, mar- 
velous conversation! the end of life. 

And music’s coming back. Bits of 
Handel this morning, swaying in the 
pine trees. I mean in memory, of 
course, I’m not that cracked. 

Not yet. 

* * * 

My father dying in a hospital, years 
ago, under the loose, transparent folds 
of an oxygen tent, weakly grabbing my 
hand: “I don’t want to die!” 1 said, 
“You won’t.” (An oxygen tube taped 
to his nose.) 

But he knew. 

There’s a neo-Christian exercise for 
this sort of thing, which you are sup- 
posed to prepare for by taking a good 
stiff jog around the block, which under 
the circumstances is, I think, just a little 
bit impractical. 

Must be some other ones. 

I drink when I’m thirsty; when I’m 
tired I sleep. Everything’s so close to- 
gether here. I stand up and wait until 
my head clears, then straddle this 
hygienic little streamlet. Brilliant possi- 
bility: sitting in it and let the bladder 
go. A sort of ambulating bedpan, and 
withhout the usual plumbers’ attach- 
ment, too. It’s warm enough to go 
naked. A scientist might be able to 
make up theories about this cave, but I 



can only look at it. Which I do, during 
breathing exercises (told you there were 
other ones). I’ve been standing up 
more — starving is overrated, doesn’t get 
you that fast — and 'then a walk round 
the cave, then a rest, then two more 
walks. I am sitting cross-legged, talking 
this. There’s no reason to collapse if 
you don’t collapse. If I fell over the 
edge I’d even be able to get back (in an 
hour or so) so why not. Putting my legs 
over the edge of the ledge and hooting. 
Although the bungalow’s certainly too 
far and I bet that food’s rotten by now. 

Why didn’t I bring a mirror with me? 
Clever, perhaps, not to; I could hang it 
on some projection of rock or branch, 
let my face go into it, my identity, and 
be faceless forever more. And there’s 
nothing to blow my nose in (except my 
fingers) because 1 can’t catch cold, no- 
body to catch it from. 

Starving doesn’t drive you mad. But 
solitude does. 

Morning. A morning. Studied the 
rock wall of the cave, extraordinarily 
beautiful and rich, such full arrange- 
ments of color and shape, such ex- 
tremely crowded information. Fra 
Angelico painted on his knees. I really 
couldn’t get over the textures (percep- 
tion is abstraction), how little detail it 
takes to see them (though perhaps it’s 
half memory), how they fit so. But then 
of course everything fits, it has to, if it 
didn’t fit it couldn’t exist, not on this 
world or any other. I fell to sniffling a 
little. Then 1 stopped because crying 
usually puts an end to this and if things 
got very good, maybe I could make the 
people come back: the edge of a naked 
plant-root, taking a short-cut for a mo- 
ment out of the wall and haloed by the 
sun in all its little hairs, wet pebbles 
shining at the back of the cave where 
the stream comes through, rocks loudly 



WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO.

declaring their own internal structure by 
their shape, by their color, by the places 
where they broke, and everything 
mutely going hallelujah on the gravity 
of transcendent gravity: the earth and 
rubbish piled up against it, the water 
dropping down with it, occasionally 
wobbling a stick (more gravity) or pry- 
ing loose a few darkish grains of some- 
thing. The eloquence of it. The mutual 
agreement of it. What to do if the ele- 
ments fall to quarreling? I knew if I 
cried it would stop so I didn't, I just 
waited. 

It went away. 

(Thinking sentimentally: Sit in thy 
cell and thy cell will teach thee all 
things.) 

Outside was afternoon. The round 
planet turning into the cone of its own 
shadow. A youth in the something of 
his something lying. (Can’t remember.) 
This endless whirling that is taking us 
noplace, so you think they’d stop. 

1 wanted to stay up and watch the 
night sky but began to doze a bit on the 
ledge so 1 went back in. I guess the 
habits of sleeping were too strong. 

So this should be not morning but the 
next morning. If 1 did part of it then. 
Must have because I say I went to sleep 
in the late afternoon and I remember 
that 1 did. But 1 can’t find the break in 
the tape. 

So dating things is no use.

Cassie, The only one I liked. The 
gossip we could have had. Even behind 
the mask of John Ude there must have 
been something human, though if you will 
pardon my cynicism I doubt it, having had 
far too much to do with that type before. 

But Cassie. ! 



The point is, when I cross over, will 
I meet only Victor? And do people who 
have died naturally, as we call it, go 
somewhere different or cross over in 
some different way than those who have 
died by violence? This is physically and 
metaphysically silly, the whole damned 
subject, but it does seem to have preoc- 
cupied people: different heavens in 
Scandinavian mythology, different hells 
in Dante, no heaven at all for the 
Greeks. Ghosts stuck in the place 
where they got strangled and so forth. 

If those seven and I ever get together, 
the only thing they’ll want to do to me 
will be kill me, and that will be rather 
difficult under the circumstances. 

Eternity with Victor: could do worse. 

But Cassie I know I'm roman- 

ticizing something about my own life, 
or something that isn’t in my own life. 
We always make such distinctions be- 
tween those of us who are us and those 
of us who are tables and chairs and then 
some table turns up and thinks at you, 
criticizes you, talks to you, looks down 
on you. 

Likes you. 

Little twelve-year-old girls walking 
about with billions of dollars of im- 
provements inside them. Like dolls with 
tapedecks in a slot in the back. 

Not that she felt that way, of course. 

What were the Grahams like at 
home? An “At-Home,” that is. Mr. 
and Mrs. Graham at home Tuesday 
next. But where? High, high up on Sta- 
ten Island with a real, polarized city 
window from which you can see all the 
other private millionaires’ spires and 
perhaps even the river? No, too small. 
They’d have an estate pitched on the 
ruins of what used to be Adirondack 
cattle country (with the farmland under- 
neath now, not above) or way up in 
Northern Maine where nobody ever

went anyhow, a real, honest-to-God es- 
tate with piles sunk into the marsh and 
a heli field. (New-money faddy, old- 
money relaxed. Some of each.) Royal- 
blue curtains over glass that doesn’t al- 
ways reveal the Maine tundra (that’s 
old-money) but that doesn’t always sub- 
stitute some other three-dimensional 
scene either (too vulgar). Forty years of 
gold and royal blue, everything that 
Valerie wants and yet Victor's rather 
proud of himself, really (especially 
when he reaches the age at which she 
has to pay him and can take it easy), 
fond of his wife but absolutely crazy 
about Lori. Reverting to type. I think 
Val first chose royal blue to flatter her- 
self and then dyed her hair to flatter the 
royal blue, stuck in it, so to speak, lik- 
ing it. The eyes of the old are blue- 
hungry. 

Alan-Bobby, totally harmless in most 
places to most people. Even, I suspect, 
running earnestly about the field, pant- 
ing while solemnly playing le futbol. 

And Sister Nathalie. Mirror-sister 
Nathalie. That vicious woman. I almost 
said to her once, aboard ship, “Wait a 
few years; you won’t be so eager.” But 
she was, desperate with her unbearable 
hatred of civilians, barely able to con- 
trol herself until she could pass over 
into that other, real world. 

What would she have done if there’d 
been no accident? If she’d got there — 
and trained— and flunked? 

Become a music lecturer. Of course. 

Cassie, Cassie, come out to play. 

Come over for a chat. 

I don’t mind if you’re rotting.

I stayed up last night to see The 
Smudge and locate sunrise, which is 
distinctly closer to sunset than it was. 

WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO. 



Plan; to kill myself on the exact, glori- 
ous day of the summer solstice but I 
won’t know what day that is until sev- 
eral days afterward. Which makes 
things difficult. (Like (he old recipe for 
nitroglycerine: stop heating one second 
before it explodes.) 

There was a streak of light at the 
zenith, falling towards the Poleward 
horizon, looking mighty like a Patrol 
ship coming in for a landing but much 
too fast. 

Then another. 

And another. All over the sky. A 
meteor swarm. As if veils were being 
plucked off the stars moment by mo- 
ment and they’d been there all along. I 
watched until we rotated out of what- 
ever debris it was, then marked where 
the sun came up (my position, nose on 
ground, where my feet were and 
where — from that — the sun was behind 
the sundial). Then I slept. I dreamed 
that a ship landed somewhere and sent a 
party that tried to rescue me, me with 
cunning patience hiding in my cave and 
shooting down every single one of 
them. Woke up with some long and in- 
volved declaration — myself or person or 
persons unknown — fading in my hear- 
ing. It came back only when I lay down 
again, just before I drifted off, i.e.: 

No use trying to rescue that one; 
can't you tell a corpse when you see it? 

(I am elegantly self-satisfied. My 
fakery is working.) 

She's been walking around dead for 
years.

Evening. Dawn. Morning? Can’t tell.

I started to say something.

Oh yes. It’s hotter. I feel fine. I’ve 
been sitting with my feet in the 
stream — mustn’t sit right in it or it 
backs up over everything — and I can 
move well enough if I keep it slow. Or 
lying on my stomach, playing with the 
water. Obese pelple in clinics can starve 
painlessly for months and what do they 
have that I dofl’t have except some idiot 
in a pale-blue (ill-fitting) coat who 
comes around every morning and says 
“Aha!” (?) Only I’m not obese. Only I 
haven’t gotten any skinnier. Only 1 
haven’t looked because I don’t want to 
know and I’m not going to, either.

Cassie’s come. Doesn’t do anything, 
just sits against the wall (my favorite 
wall, too! the other’s got big boulders 
sticking out of it) with her arms folded 
and looks at me. I’ve put the vocoder 
on whisper so she won’t hear. Not that 
I expect she’s real; if I got up she’d 
probably rise in my field of vision like 
all hallucinations do — either stand up or 
float in the air — I have a talent for these 
things, always did; had to be careful 
with all those neo-Christian “exercises.” 
Could never be hypnotiaed without 
drugs, though, probably a defense 
against my own imagination. 

I said to her (smugly, I’m afraid), “I 
can’t be hypnotized.” 

Words in my mind: You're schizoid. 

Insults! Insults from her. 

We had a long — no, we didn’t; that's 
an invention; I simply could not help 
looking at her because when you hal- 
lucinate or remember, that is your 
center of energy, I mean you’re creating 
it. So you get fixed on it. And I 
watched her. Breathless. Not frightened. 
In suspense. 



She did nothing. 

I’ll tell you how she went away; this 
isn’t really visual, you see, it’s a matter 
of conviction and what happened was 
the conviction went out of me and 1 
knew I was looking at a memory. There 
was a pattern of roots and shadows and 
a ghost and a pattern of roots and 
shadows and a ghost. Then the memory 
goes. Nothing positive but it’s not there 
and of course she picked that side — it’s 
all rocks and shadows. 

When they finally arrive, what will 
they all say to me? 

I was very cross with her. 

* * * 

Day again. There’s a philosophical 
problem here. Falling asleep, waking, 
hard or soft, hunger, eating, illness, 
feeling sex, running, being dizzy — why 
can’t we remember them? They evapo- 
rate. Right now I can’t remember a hot 
bath. About my tooth implant, I re- 
member the office, the medical lady in 
the pale-green coat, what everyone said, 
what I thought under the anesthetic, and 
the extreme oddity of it, too, I re- 
member that. But I can’t remember the 
pain. There’s only a warning muddle 
somewhere at the back of the experi- 
ence, a faint haze of obfuscation. Now I 
know that physiologically, literally, it’s 
still all there — all in my brain waiting to 
be waked up. I mean if you had the 
proper electrodes. But why can’t I wake 
it up, dammit? The second time I had a 
tooth put in I didn’t remember but my 
feet knew (they kept trying to turn 
around and walk me out of the office) 
and I suppose my body knew (I 
couldn’t sleep the night before) but / 
didn’t know. Until it began to happen 
again and then I wondered: how could I 
ever forget! 



108 



GALAXY 



And then I forgot. 

You know, I was very old-fashioned 
as a teenager; I really thought that a real 
physical letting-go (pleasure, anger, 
anything where I’d stop controlling 
myself — I called it “stop thinking”) 
would absolutely bring the roof down 
around my ears, or if it didn’t lead to 
instant death, disgrace, shatterment and 
horror, it would cure me rightaway of 
all my “problems” and I would never 
be unhappy again. Don’t know where 
this came from; it must have been in the 
air because nobody ever told me in so 
many words but we are still — maybe 
it’s the price we pay for being so 
rich — a Puritanical people. 

I was so disappointed! 

Primary things — the stuff bodily ex- 
perience is made of — just doesn’t last. 

Even music, beautiful, music, hear- 
ing, that won't last unless you translate 
it into ideas, put it into your head, re- 
create it, drum it in. A weird business: 
grief without bodily pain, joy without 
bodily pleasure, emotion without flesh, 
idea-joy, idea-grief, but it makes you 
shiver and it makes you cry and it can 
be dreadful and wonderful and unbear- 
able. And that’s not the body making 
you feel (which of course it can); it’s 
the body trying only to follow what you 
feel. To mean, not be. Which the body 
is not good at. 

(For example, fucking. Why is it 
sometimes rememberable and sometimes 
not. And what do you remember? I 
think either a picture or an emotion but 
not the physical thing itself, not half an 
hour later, sometimes. Like a dried leaf. 
A dead rose. A taste that’s gone. Actors 
practice sensory memory for years and 
even they have to turn it into something 
else. I mean put it into their heads, 
translate it into ideas. 

(I can so vividly recall Marilyn, who 



must have drifted past that eighty-story 
building with terrific aplomb — as 
always — with her hands in her 
pockets — saying to me quietly, “it’s not 
in the papers” right after “they’re re- 
building the whole floor” with her usu- 
al, slightly hesitant way of speaking, as 
if she were apologizing for the triviality 
of what she was saying and yet always 
very passionate about it, and wrinkling 
her forehead in anxiety above those 
queer, huge, round, owl-like eyeglasses 
she always wore, looking at me with 
her magnified eyes as if to say: now we 
both know. And also: the world is fall- 
ing apart. 

(I also remember L.B. trying to get a 
contra-tuba — of all things! — through the 
door of the attic where we were holding 
a neo-Christian meeting and not quite 
succeeding and finally sitting on the 
landing outside that very expensive at- 
tic, which was in a house made of real, 
restored wood (practically a national 
monument) with his large, delicate, 
slightly flushed ears sticking out — as 
always — and finally managing on that 
absurd, coiled, huge instrument to pro- 
duce a dreadful, toneless, melancholy 
howl like that of a locomotive in ex- 
tremis, as if the last nineteenth-century 
steam engine in the Smithsonian were 
finally expiring and telling everybody 
about it. 

(I remember the third time we made 
love and how I decided it must be so 
very different because the room was dif- 
ferent or I was just precisely drunk 
enough — though I wasn’t drunk at 
all — or had eaten for once exactly the 
proper kind of dinner. He said it was 
because we had the contra-tuba in the 
room with us and that the contra-tuba, 
alone among all the instruments of the 
orchestra, had a soul. My memory of 
him is built up of many, many times af-

ter this all made into one, just like the 
year I was speaking for the Populars 
and in just the same way: an intelligent, 
ruthless abstraction of what mattered, 
details plucked unhesitatingly from the 
real, unstable times and places and put 
together into a meaning, a mosaic, a 
symbol, an icon, because that’s what 
mattered and that’s how it mattered, and 
because I kne’w more than I ever have 
before or since just what mattered and 
what that meaning was. 

(Meaning preserves things by isolat- 
ing them, by taking them beyond them- 
selves, making them transcendent, re- 
vealing their real insides, by pointing 
beyond them. 

(If we perceived everything, we 
would know nothing. There would be 
no pattern. 

(But I don’t remember hunger. I 
chose that because it fits intellectually. I 
don’t feel it. Though I recall very 
clearly my rage when I was seven and 
told to eat my loathesome soup because 
little children were starving in 
. well, you pick a place. Alone in 
my gleeful rage among eleven well- 
behaved little boys and girls, it was I 
who pushed forward my bowl and said, 
in sly satisfaction, “Send it to them.” 
How do you ship soup? When I was six 
there was the first real space travel, I 
mean instantaneously from one point to 
another; I remember this only because 
the whole topic was so profoundly unin- 
teresting and we all had to sit still to 
hear about it. And I remember — at 
ten — remembering what a nump I’d 
been at six and wishing I had remem- 
bered all the right, glorious, proper, 
great things about that great day instead 
of the silly damfool things I did re- 
member: that Ruby Fossett beat up 
Charlie Washington for saying black 
people were the same as Indians and 



Indians had to come from India, so 
black people couldn’t have come from 
Africa; that somebody called somebody 
else Slotface and knocked over my 
block bridge (accidentally); that at din- 
ner I gave some vegetables I didn’t like 
to Ruby Fossett who got rid of them in 
some awesome and mysterious way 
without eating them. But I knew Ruby 
Fossett was a magical person because 
she was seven and could stand on her 
head and had a big, beautiful, rusty-red 
’fro, which was by far the most impres- 
sive hair I had ever seen. I do not, by 
the way, remember what the Day-care 
answered when I offered my slopping 
soup to be mailed to the starving chil- 
dren; I think he just imitated the Great 
Stone Face. Don’t really remember 
Charlie’s last name, either; it was some- 
thing else. I think. And I don’t re- 
member what the Center looked like, 
even. I don’t remember much. 

(And Hunger’s gone. Kachina-mask- 
dancing Hunger like a figure in a play, 
that I can imagine. Or a word in a dic- 
tionary with pronunciation marks over 
it. Or I hunger for righteousness, that's 
a metaphor. But I cannot even begin to 
imagine what I felt. Or that 1 felt at all; 
it’s dropped out of the world. It’s a 
hole. It’s nothing. 

(Not even nothing. Just the intellec- 
tual conviction that there ought to be a 
gap somewhere. Only that.) 

So ideas stick. Meanings stick. Any- 
thing you can force inside your head 
and keep there. Also emotion. Which 
shouldn’t last but it does. My God, it 
lasts and lasts. Wish it didn’t. 

Old poem: when the bones are clean 
and the dead bones gone . but I’m 
getting it wrong. The Celts had three

There was a trial. Dreams merging 
into wakefulness, back to dreams again. 
I was very cross. They ranged them- 
selves round the cave, knowing I was 
too weak, too tired, too starved, to get 
away. It wasn’t fair. Big, dark shapes I 
couldn’t see. When you first wake up 
you can’t see clearly and everything’s 
flat; that’s when a coat hanging on a 
closet door becomes something huge 
standing over you, until you can see in 
depth again. It's the closeness that’s 
threatening, right on your eyeballs. 
Things at the foot of the bed or right on 
the bed but it’s really a picture on the 
wall or a window curtain. When I’m 
badly off. When I’m tired. I couldn’t 
see their faces. I sat up and thought I 
would go to the water purifier to wash 
my face but I couldn’t. I was too tired. 

I lay down again — or stood up, I can’t 
remember — anyway it was none of their 
business and I hadn’t invited them. 

I said, “’Go away.” 

They just shifted a little. 

John Ude said. 

Then Nathalie said . and Cas- 
sandra said . and Alan said. 

Then John Ude said again. 

I yelled, “You're always first, aren’t 
you? You and the Goddamned govern- 
ment! I bet you were a clerk. I bet you 
never got within five miles of anything 
real.” 



He said, You know that / worked for 
the real government. 

“You are a damned, damned bully,” 
I told him; “But who can you bully 
now? Who are you going to bully 
through eternity?” 

You. 

Silence. 

I said, “All right. I’m a coward. 
Satisfied? I didn’t have the guts to stand 
out against you in ’25; I let myself be 
scared off. But what does it matter 
now? We’re all here now, aren’t we? 
And there’ll be others. And my religion 
is just as real and just as important as 
the other so don’t you go tampering 
with that. Don’t you go telling me I’m 
an escapist or something.” 

He said. Cod is easier than guns. 

Silence. 1 don’t believe him. It’s just 
what he’d say. You can shoot a lot of 
things but you can’t shoot down death. 
And if you capture a tank, what can 
you use it for except what a tank does? 
You can’t plant a garden with it. 

Coward, he said. 

I said, “Oh go to hell.” (Quickly, as 
if it were one word, the way you do. 
You know.) 

Killer coward. 

But it was a worse word than that, 
somehow, I don’t know what it was, 
and not Juhn Ude who is only a mask. I 
looked at the people standing around 
my home, dressed as I had seen them 
last and with not a mark of death on 
them; there’s no fogginess in this cave. 
It is from the big boulder on the left- 
hand side as you face out — counting 
clockwise — John, every inch The Pro- 
fessor, polishing his pipe on the edge of 
his now (rather ragged) jacket; Cas-

averted as if she didn’t want to talk to 
me in her white sheet or was ashamed 
or disliked me); and then Valeria, who

stands with her arms clasped in front of 
her loosely but looking very severe; and 
beyond her (on the other side, none of 
the'm are standing in the sunlight) 
Nathalie — again separated from them 
all — disgusted, fiercely impatient with 
everyone, sitting with her knees under 
her chin, scowling and pitching pebbles 
at the cave "floor. Then Lori, who’s 
reading a big, illustrated storybook with 
a fairytale cover, a fairy godmother or 
something like that, and beyond her in 
the shadows, but somehow luminous, 
young, and very beautiful, standing 
with his arms folded across his chest, 
emotionless now, the one who called 
me a killer. 

Killer coward, said Alan-Bobby for 
the second time. 

I said, “I suppose you’re in on this 
little kangaroo-court because I wasn’t 
stuck on you, like Lori, and you didn’t 
get to beat me up, like Nathalie, and I 
didn’t praise the shit out of you, like 
the men, so I guess I just didn’t kow- 
tow enough to your beautiful, strong, 
masculine bod, huh?” 

He said, / had none. 

Silence. 

I had the muscles of an ox, which 
always embarrassed me, I was not 
beautiful, J was stupid, and 1 knew noth- 
ing. 

That’s Alan-Bobby now, who is 
thinking or talking or somehow putting 
these words into my mind, standing 
angelically tall in the darkness of the 
cave (which should be too low for him; 
that’s how he bashed his head) and 
somehow lighting himself up from in- 
side, like a Christmas-tree candle. He is 
so lovely. He said; 

We're dead. So we're wise. But still, 
you killed me. Is it allowed to kill 
fools? 

You killed me, said Lori, unin- 



terested, glancing up for a moment from 
her book. 

And me. said Valeria with calm 
evenness, and I saw with surprise — no, 
really with astonishment — that although 
she could have — well, I suppose, being 
dead, you know — I mean she could 
have come back in her blue-and-gold 
Indian sari, her gold jewelry, anything 
she liked, but she hadn’t. She was in 
trousers and blouse, looking just the way 
I’d last seen her. Her hair was gray at the 
roots. 

She said, You killed me. / was half- 
crazy then. Is it permitted to kill the 
crazy or the rich? Is it permitted to kill 
someone weak and old whom you could 
have disarmed? 

And me, said John Ude urbanely, pull- 
ing on his unlit pipe. A reasonable man 
who could have been persuaded, a de- 
spairing man whose despair you never 
even saw, whose despair you might 
have helped, but you never saw it, 
whose despair you might have used, but 
you never tried. 

A fool who could have so easily been 
deceived, and Alan. 

A fifty-year-old you could have 
knocked down, said Valeria. 

Cassie said, You ended my life, too; 
she was in tears. Her face suddenly pre- 
senting itself to mine, the horrible 
weeping of suffering without control 
and without hope; I didn’t want to look 
at it. So I put my hands over my eyes 
but even so they were all visible; Cassie 
rocked back and forth in pain; Lori read 
her book; Cass cried out loud, Oh Nath, 
Nath, what has she done to me? I’m so 
lonely! and fell to her knees, her chiton 
spreading out on the rock, her hair stir- 
ring about her face, one lock drifting up 
and back, up and back, and she throw-

your fear. Look in my face and you’ll 
see your own rage and your own depri- 
vation. I know you. Do you think I 
don’t know you? 

Look in the mirror. 

They didn’t fade. They got sharper 
and sharper, exactly as I had seen them 
last. They talked out of the cave with- 
out touching one another, as if they had 
no feelings for each other and no rela- 
tion to each other; Val went first and 
John Ude second, then Alan, with none 
of his beauty left, and Nathalie, without 
any expression on her face, and then 
Cassie with as commonplace a look as 
if nothing had happened. They stepped 
out into the sunshine and I think they 
may have turned to one side or the 
other on the little ledge that’s in front of 
the cave, but I don’t know. They just 
disappeared. Then Lori came, dragging 
her book, and her other hand in her 
father’s; Victor Graham in his beautiful, 
blue dress-suit, not as he had looked 
when he died, but spruce, rich, hand- 
some, even smiling. He looked free. 

He said, “They do go on, don’t 
they? But we all have something like 
that.’’ Lori was intently shaking the 
dust off her fairy-tale book. He said, a 
little apologetically, “She likes that 
kind of thing. You know? And I’m told 
it’s a good book. Come on, dear,” and 
he started towards the entrance to the 
cave. I noticed with a kind of horror 
that he had to bend over because he was 
such a tall man; the roof was too low 
for him. At the threshold he stepped out 
as if he were going to continue walking 
right out into space, and as he began to 
dissolve in the sunshine — or I lost sight 
of him because my eyes weren’t used to 
the dazzle outside — Lori tugged at his 
hand for a moment and turned back. 
She said something to me and then she 
went out with her father into that bril- 



liancy I couldn’t see, and was gone. I 
have never seen that child so well- 
mannered. 

She smiled at me dutifully. 

Then she said, “Thank you.” 

“For what?” I said. She looked sur- 
prised. 

She said, “For killing me.” 

* * * 

Nothing settled. Nothing! What’s in- 
side my head comes out, that’s all. 
Don’t think I believed in them, that 
they could get here, that they accused 
me, that six people could stand up in- 
side this cave, that they levitated out the 
door, that 1 didn’t form them from the 
cracks and striations in the walls, the 
dirt, boulders, bumps, lumps, shadows, 
that sniff. 

Anyhow she was only being polite to 
please her father. 

* * * 

Afternoon. L.B. came to visit, much 
more realistically, by the way, sitting 
cross-legged against the side wall and 
shifting around uncomfortably, sticking 
his tongue out a little when the pebbles 
hurt his ass . There were even footprints 
coming in from the ledge outside, 1 
mean places where his feet had dis- 
turbed the cave floor; at least for a 
while there were. I was so pleased to 
see him, so glad, but I didn’t dare touch 
because I knew he’d go. So I asked him 
why didn’t he bring the contra-tuba he’d 
left outside the cave. 

He said, “Are you kidding? The silly 
thing’s enormous. Think of all the ec- 
toplasm it would take. Besides, you 
know I can’t play it.” 

I got snide and made an improper 
suggestion about something else he 



114 



GALAXY 



couldn’t play in his present state. 

He blushed, mostly in his delicate 
ears, where you could always see it 
happen; he has wonderful ears, slightly 
transparent, that always reminded me of 
a bat’s, they stick out like two silky 
signal flags; he said, “Oh dear, no, re- 
ally you shouldn’t,” which is exactly 
the way L.B. has always talked. 

I said, “well, what are you doing 
now? Still preaching? Still teaching? 
Are you asleep somewhere and visiting 
me in your sleep?” 

Silence. He looked at the floor. He 
seemed very unhappy. That twist of the 
head, putting his chin into the hollow of 
his collar-bone. Hunching up the shoul- 
der. Rubbing his cheek and his shoulder 
as he always did when he suffered, ol’ 
knobbly man, and now he’s doing 
something else, something rather dis- 
tressing; he looks up and there are tears 
running out of his wide blue eyes. 

1 cried, alarmed, “Elbee, are you 
dead ?” 

Silence. The erotic is going out of 
him like water out of a glass; once I 
saw someone nearly sever a finger when 
I was working in hospital and the color 
went out of his face like a column of 
mercury dropping; that doctor turned 
from brown to greyish-brown as if 
somebody’d pulled down a shade. L.B. 
is doing this, and he’s getting flatter 
and flatter somehow, sharper and 
sharper, like an image that’s alive but 
doesn’t quite belong with its 
background. I don't like this. 

He said, “Oh my dear, you’ve com- 
mitted murder.” 

“Go away.” (I said it again, totally 
shocked: “Go away!”) 

“But my dear, how can 1 love you if 
you’ve committed murder?” 

1 started to cry. “Yes,” I said, “all 
right, you Christian, don’t.” 



I added, “You know it was self- 
defense!" 

He merely looked at me. 

“Of course it was, of course it was!” 
1 said. “You saw it. I mean, if you’re 
made of ectoplasm and all. I mean run- 
ning into the brush yelling Colonize, 
Colonize, and all that. They were going 
to force me to have babies. I was going 
to be tied to a tree and raped, for god- 
ness’ sake. It was a mass-delusional 
system, L.B., you know what they’re 
like, and anybody who doesn’t agree 
has to be shut up somehow because it’s 
too terrifying. So I ran away, but they 
wouldn’t let it be; they came back after 
me to drag me back into that insanity 
and I killed them; I had to. I kept tell- 
ing them we were all dead. You know 
that. And we were. 1 bet they had a lot 
more fun chasing me than they would 
have had by dying slowly in a few 
months. It gave them something to do. 
And I might remind you, old buddy, 
that several of those nice people were 
trying to kill me.” 

“Murderer,” he said. 

I started crying again. I said, “You 
get out of here, you father! You just get 
out of here! This is not your cave so 
you just haul ass!” 

He said thoughtfully, “Murder. Pure 
murder. Don’t you think? And for no 
reason. Just because those people an- 
noyed you. You assumed, of course, 
that they ought to adapt to you; it never 
occurred to you that you ought to adapt 
to them. You simply didn’t like them.” 

I couldn’t talk. 

He said, “Out of spite, really, I 
think. Don’t you? A hidden wish. 
Anger. The chance to do what you’d 
always really wanted to do. I think what 
you always wanted, under the 
cameraderie, under the sociability, was 
the chance to be really and truly alone. 



WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO. 



115 



autocratically alone, one might say. Ar- 
rogantly alone. Yes, that’s right. You 
talk so much about there being no law 
here for the others, but I don’t think 
you ever reflected truly that, after all, 
there was no law binding you, either, 
nothing to keep you from ultimately do- 
ing exactly what you wanted to do. And 
what was it? Why, to kill. One might 
look at the whole series of events as a 
series of provocations; you see, you 
pushed them to the point where they’d 
give you a pretext for murdering them 
and then when Nathalie nagged them 
into following you — it was she who did 
it, of course; if Nathalie had been more 
intelligent and a little less conventional, 
and hadn’t needed people around to 
boss so much, 1 think she would have 
done exactly what you did — well, 
you’re very like Nathalie, you know. 
Very like. Probably the only person in 
history to depopulate an entire planet so 
easily. Pocket genocide, one might call 
it. And for spite. For sheer nastiness 
and bad feeling. And for no other 
reason. So 1 can hardly love you now, 
can I?” 

I got to my feet, although I was dizzy 
and shaking — oh, was 1 shaking! — and I 
cried, You liar! You fake! Why are you 
here ? Why’d you bother to come? You 
never loved me, never, never, you only 
pretended and then you fake things up 
because you know it wasn't like that 
and it’s all just to destroy me! 

He said calmly, “That is true.” 

Then you're the killer! and I 
screamed, 1 really did. There was more 
argument running in and out of my 
ears, pro and contra, not a loud boom- 
ing or even a sound but pure confusion 
until I couldn’t tell if I were speaking or 
not or he was or not; it was all a tangle. 

So 1 leaned over to hit him and fell 
on my face. 1 don’t think falls can hurt 



me now. I’m too light. Anyway, there 
was a sort of cushiony, dreadful mess 
of arguing and pullings-apart and past 
lives all over the floor; I think that 
helped. And my own blood sounding in 
my ears. By looking up I could see 
L.B.’s face close to mine and though it 
was the same face, it wasn’t, not really; 
it had become unchangeable, like a 
photograph. A photograph of a smile is 
a smile first but look at it too long and 
it comes apart into tics and muscular 
oddities; soon you can’t even tell if it’s 
a smile or not. The time element has 
been left out. L.B. was like that. I think 
he was gloating, but I couldn’t tell. He 
might have been smiling. He might 
have been sad. He was going to do 
something very bad and it would make 
him happy. Then I knew it wasn’t L.B. 
He said, God hates you. 

Now that’s ridiculous. It’s abomina- 
bly silly and it would never cross 
L.B.’s mind, let alone his lips, except 
as a particularly comic, blasphemous 
horror. This is someone else. 

I said carefully, “How do you 
know?” 

He said with a sickly-sweet smile, “1 
know what you know.” 

I said, “But how, L.B.? How do you 
know? Are you my conscience?” 

“Yes,” he said, edging along the 
wall as if he wanted to get out of the 
cave without getting to his feet. “Yes, 
I’m your conscience.” 

“Come on, L.B.,” I said. “You’re 
not my conscience.” 

“I’m not your conscience.” 

“Tell me,” I said in, I think, a kind 
of croak because everything was break- 
ing up very fast now and oh, I had to 
be cunning or I would have to live with 
this monster for the rest of my life, for 
eternity, who knows; I said, “Tell me, 
tell me, where is L.B. right now?” 



116 



GALAXY 



“Don’t know,” he said. 

“Are you L.B.?” I said, and sud- 
denly still, he assumed an even odder, 
intense, kind of fixity — yet this one was 
totally human — like the moment when 
someone touches you on the shoulder 
from behind and you don’t know who; 
you gather your forces internally, 
perhaps, or do what’s called “holding 
your breath” though it’s more like hold- 
ing your mind, not thinking. The strict 
arrest. I’m not sure I want to find out 
who this is. 

He said pathetically, “I try. I do try. 
Please believe me.” 

“Who are you?” 

“You give me such an awful role to 
play. That’s because you’re such an aw- 
ful person. You’re most unfair.” 

“Now look here, you idiot — ” 

“Yes, I’m an idiot. You’re an idiot! 
Making poor Elbee into your conscience 
and what a conscience! It’s just like 
you. Of course he never loved you. 
Who could? You’re not loveable. / 
don’t love you. Nobody could ever love 
you. Why? Because you’re bad, bad, 
bad, bad, bad — ” 

and was talking to myself. Had been. 
All along. Of course. Unmistakeably 
sincere. To think as badly of him as 
that! 

But I am. I’m impossible. Dreadful. 
Totally wretched little bit of nothing. 
He should have dropped me long ago. 
What I could have 
Should have 
Couldn’t 

Should have thought really 
Really! Arrogant, solitary, secretly 
cruel, I am. I am. Used to say to my- 
self Who isn’t, who isn’t, but it’s not 
true. I’ve been unhumanly hungry and 
starved for years, as nasty as a starved 
rat. A cannibal. Wished they wouldn’t 
be persuaded. And glad they weren’t.

Give it a good end, go out in a great 
big bang. End to stupid parties after lec- 
tures, people I didn’t know, people 1 
wanted to kick, trying to live without 
roots like an air plant, endless traveling 
with idiots, trying to pretend they’re 
bright when I’d like to hit them and I 
like them when I don’t and it doesn't 
matter when it dofs and 1 ought to love 
that hateful, ghastly bunch and oh Lord, 
what was I doing there, anyhow. 

I rather enjoyed killing them off and I 
don’t care. Except Cassie. 

Alan-Bobby hit in the head with a 
rock, good for him! Nathalie shot? 
Good for her! John Ude shot, good. 
Lori, fine. Val, best of all . Goody good 
good for them ! It’s a game they under- 
stood inside-out and once I started play- 
ing I rather liked it because I’m not 
exactly an amateur, either, you under- 
stand', and it’s all yummy self-assertion, 
all big adventure, isn’t it, oh my, creep- 
ing about in the canebrake in our un- 
derdrawers, trying to pot each other. 

No, I had to. I really had to. 

But all the same I did. What “pocket 
genocide”? I guess so. Up to the el- 
bows in blood. Poetry. 

And now I have to live with this aw- 
ful, awful woman, this dreadful, 
wretched, miserable woman, until she 
dies. 

* * * 

I cried myself to sleep — not real 
tears, silly, easy tears; the awful thing 
was that I couldn’t stop, they're the 
kind that keep leaking out of you — and 
I called myself all sorts of insulting 
names. I fell asleep calling myself 
names. Dreamed we were back together 
at my place, all this sensuality a topog- 
raphy I couldn’t describe to you, a sort 



of lovely pocket universe, and in the 
summer dawn (this really happened 
once) from some dingy, cement ledge 
outside our window: 

SQUEEEEEEEECH ! 

Like a siren right under your pillow. 
The damnedest sound. The bed quaked. 
I thumped him in the ribs, said, “Bang 
on the wall.” He said, I think sitting 
up, “What? What?” 

I said, ‘‘Sparrows. Bang on the 
wall.” 

There was a nest in the air- 
conditioner. It was an old portable and 
made a beautiful bird’s-nest, right be- 
tween the ledge and the bottom of the 
exhaust cave, a lovely steady current of 
warm air. Tremendously attractive. If 
you’d been able to go outside, you’d 
have seen grass and twigs sticking up 
haphazardly from beneath the machine. 
Sparrows are messy builders. If you 
whop at them, they shut up for a couple 
of minutes, just enough to get back to 
sleep. 

SQUEEEEE-HEEEEECH ! 

By then he was up. Quivering. He 
said, “Kill them.” 

I sat up. “Why? They’re just ba- 
bies." 

“Babies? They’re banshees.” 

“Look, the building people are com- 
ing in a week to close up the gap. 
They’ll be flying and out by then. You 
don’t want to murder a whole bunch of 
helpless little cutey baby birds, now do 
you?” 

“Yes,” he said. 

I said, “Um ... I know, but you 
can’t take the unit out; I tried. Takes 
special tools. And you need a cable 
through the hook on top or the whole 
unit falls eighteen stories and murders 
someone.” 

The food factory was at it again. Oh 
God, it was awful. 



118 



GALAXY 



I said, “Elbee, have respect for the 
sanctity of life.” 

“Sparrows?" he said. 

And sparrows they were. Every sun- 
rise the infants woke and screamed hor- 
ror and starvation — you have no idea 
what that is like only a meter from your 
ear and no soundproofing — and opened 
their tiny, little, red beaks: feed me! 
feed me! (at about one hundred and 
sixty degrees’ extension) and drove their 
desperate parents, who probably wanted 
to sleep as much as I did, out to 
exhaust themselves and ruin their health 
finding enough polluted insects to cram 
thrice its own weight each day into that 
insatiable scarlet gullet. There is 
nothing — I repeat, nothing — in the 
homeothermic realm uglier or stupider 
than a baby bird. 

And sparrows! The only flying species 
nobody’s ever had to re-seed or protect or 
re-transport or do anything but discour- 
age. 

If they’d been swallows or cranes or 
titmice, anything. Even grackles. But 
sparrows? They’re taking over the world. 

SQUEEE-HEEEEEE-HEEEEE- 
EEEEEEECH ! 

“Oh God, have you been living with 
that?” he said. 

I said yeah, well, at least they ma- 
tured fast. Then he began to look as if 
he were getting dangerous ideas — 
dangerous to himself, 1 mean — like at- 
tempting to open the top of the window 
or unscrew the front of the conditioner 
.and try to poke through the coils. 

They did it again. He pounded on the 
wall. “Shut up, you bloody birdies!” 
Silence. We had slept two hours. I usu- 
ally wadded the extra pillow over my 
head and managed somehow. L.B. 
shouted, “Filthy, lousy, bird-brained 
birds!” He was always accurate. And 
added, “Oh, why couldn’t you have 



had the sense to be born fleder- 
mausen?” 

We liked bats. 

Then he said, “Oh hey, do you have 
a rubber hose? If we could pry some of 
the insulation off and run a hose 
through the edge — ” 

“And pipe them ten thousand 
worms?” I said. “Oh no. They’ll stop 
in an hour, honestly.” 

He said, hopefully, “Boiling water?” 
I shook my head. “I tried.” The 
trick is to get at them when they’re first 
nesting and repeatedly scare the living 
daylights out of them — birds are very 
emotional — until they get the idea 
there’s a large, very irritable, dangerous 
mammal who comes with the site and 
they do, finally, go somewhere else. 
But once they’ve laid eggs, it’s you or 
them. And I hate them. Nesting in my 
ear. Denouncing us. Making everything 
in your nervous system fire off all at 
once when you’re peacefully asleep, as 
if you’d been electrocuted. We dis- 
cussed various avicidal methods, each 
worse than the last, for the next hour 
until the clamor, no din, no — the 
screams — died down, and then we lay 
down again. I said, “Oh, what a mess 
there’ll be when they clean out the win- 
dow.” And then (and I knew I was 
dreaming, but my dream continued to 
follow that scenario of twelve years 
ago) I prodded L.B.’s velvety-bony rib. 
He gave a sleepy, chuckling gasp: 
harpf. Hoopf. 

“Hey,” I said, “hey, Elbee, what 
would you do if it was people?” 

Hapf. Sometimes he felt like a moose 
in bed: all antlers. 

“Really,” I said, “what?” 

“Kill’m,” Pwft. 

“No, if it was people, if they 
bothered you more than that, if they re- 
ally wanted to ... to put you in jail

forever or mess your life up or some- 
thing, I don't mean kill you but some- 
thing really bad, what would you do?” 

An adult bird twittered softly outside: 
there, there, my lovely little red-funnel 
darlings, my yelling stomachs, my 
squally, pinfeathered dearies, my hope, 
my joy. 

Damn them! Parental insanity. 

I woke up. 

* * * 

Twelve years ago I’d gone to sleep 
and so missed the answer that way. A 
classic, textbook dream but so far, so 
very, very far, so unfortunately far 
away from any textbook at all. 

I’ll tell you the neo-Christian theory 
of love. The neo-Christian theory of 
love is this: 

There is little of it. Use it where it’s 
effective. 

Then I started to cry again but too 
easy, just leaking out of my soul, al- 
most comfy. Penance can’t be like that. 
And then 1 thought of Nathalie, Alan, 
Val & Co., all fledglings in a nest, all 
flopping about and squeeching like 
mad: oh feed, feed, feed! Agree! Agree! 
Agree ! 

I am arrogant. Dreams don’t lie. 
Can’t do it in a dream. It made me 
laugh. I’ll never-be properly guilty, 
can’t be, it’s too funny. 

Feed me, feed me, feed me! (Am 1 
one, too?) 

Read me, read me, read me!

sion, but just a fragrance I could’t see 
beyond the edge of the ledge. Night. 
The Smudge rising. When there are no 
stars you see the sky differently: huge, 
immense, utter Nothing if there’s any 



light, then flat and right against your 
eyes when it’s black. You imagine 
walls, as if it were a room. She was 
visiting. You know? I imagined talking 
to her. Can’t remember, except a gen- 
eral feeling it was all right. Marilyn 
talking silently, ever so eloquent ges- 
tures. Like the alphabet for the deaf 
with her hands but so beautifully tender: 
One and she opposed her right 
forefinger to the third finger of her left 
hand; Two and it was third finger to 
third finger; Three and it was fourth to 
the same third, left-hand finger; Around 
and she rotated both hands, fingers 
loosely half-curled like a shell; Together 
and she joined one palm to another, 
spread fingers to spread fingers, like 
mirror meeting mirror. Her lips moving. 
Head to one side, perhaps wry, perhaps 
smiling. Bending her head to take off 
her big glasses: behold naked Marilyn! 
She touched lightly the collar of her 
shirt: another difficult curve, this one 
half-closing, flatter, fingers together but 
thumb apart. What fine points she was 
making. I watched her until sunrise, 
slept, dreamed of L.B. playing in an 
orchestra (ah, but he played le jazz on 
the side, L.B. skulking into magical 
romantic cellar at midnight with infra- 
tuba, plugging self into huge console in 
middle of smoke, tilting hat over face 
for flics, slurping beer, blowing tuba, 
making wicked and forbidden sounds 
from current in brain, sneer on face, hat 
tipping up and down, shoulders bounc- 
ing, nope, friend-o, I just do this for 
amps, great screams, les cops ! and off 
we go into the night, no L.B. but only 
infra-tuba-with-legs and blushing ears 
going skrimble skramble down cobbled 
pavement into romantic darkness and 
falling flat on face) and when he took 
off his traditional, somber, musician’s 
black tights with silver-sparkle round

the wrists, neck, and ankles, and he 
said — peering at crotch level — “What is 
this?” and 1 “What is that?” and we 
cried out together, “Love!” and danced 
naked but very classically, until he got 
down on one knee and I went up on 
point on his unpadded thigh, bracing 
myself against his bony shoulder, doing 
an arabesque, and he said, “Must 
you?” and then he said, “Really, you’d 
better wake up; that hurts,” and he ad- 
ded, “Why are you dreaming in 
French? It’s not like you.” 

I woke up laughing. 

* * * 

Day. Day something. Something 
from Marilyn stays about, something 
from L.B. I’m dreadfully thin. I mean 
in the ordinary way, of course, not 
starving yet because starving takes too 
long, I think. It takes months. That’s 
amazing. Can see not only my ribs, 
which I always could, more or less, but 
also the bones around my knees and my 
thighs have got all flappy. Arms, too. 
Does that signify anything? My thumb 
and middle finger meet round my upper 
arm. I sat in the water and thought: 
should I measure myself? (Being de- 
lightfully dirty; you can shit in the wa- 
ter, first of course sitting in it and back- 
ing it up, and eventually you'll be clean 
all by itself. I get dizzy standing.) Only 
maybe this is an hallucination, too: 
skinny legs, big knees, hanging belly, 
something left over from a newsreel. 
Well, I’m not swollen up. Can't re- 
member what that’s called, with the 
no-protein. Or is that only with chil- 
dren? Different when you’re grown up. 

I don’t know. 

A couple of times I tried to see my 
face in the water, I mean I think I did. 
But now doesn’t matter, I’m just being, 
the most extraordinary freedom just to 



be behind your face and not cultivate it 
as if it were a house plant. 
“Cheeeeez!” Me at five, fidgeting in 
the holo studio, fancying the cameras 
are dental machines and I’m being terri- 
bly brave. Less boring than just wait- 
ing. Earlier today there was lots of 
music coming from all over, which was 
a terrific liberation; it’s all been sealed 
up inside me til now and I doubt some- 
body strung up wires and speakers all 
over the cacti. You don’t need them if 
you’ve a good memory. I went slowly 
to the ledge and hung my feet over, 
feeling like the Old Herb Lady who 
lives in the cave; it was coming from all 
around, in this strange place like a vast, 
inhuman auditorium, Bach from the 
hills and bushes and when I looked into 
the blazing blue sky, Handel. Very ap- 
propriate. 

The trumpet shall sound! 

I wonder if they really believed that. 
Et cetera. The trumpet shall and we 
shall, et cetera. My singing must sound 
awfully squeaky and the vocoder isn’t 
set for music; this will just be words. It 
was memory-music, but I had no con- 
trol over it, it just came, what I’ve lec- 
tured about for years and loved for 
years, like Saint Francis preaching to 
the birds (except sparrows); here I am 
playing music for silver-haired plants 
and alien hills. They all sat in rows and 
listened. From the organ (which? brain? 
kidney? lung?) Bach’s Toccata and 
Fugue in D Minor, which if you don’t 
know it. I’m sorry for you. A great, 
majestic, howling discord that grum- 
bles down into the abyss and then in- 
sists its way stubbornly up again, bigger 
than a building, bigger than anything; to 
play it properly you’d need a speaker 
the size of a cathedral. A throat as big 
as the Mississippi. It played and played; 
everything I knew played until I wept. 



WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO.

how can one not? If there’s faith, 
there’s music. They whisper: 

Since by Man came death. 

(heh heh that leaves me out, even in 
the minor key, pianissimo) 

Since by Man came death. 

(more insistent now, and heavier, but 
they still believe it) 

BY MAN CAM'E ALSO! THE RES- 
SUR-RECTION! 

(wups, fast and fortissimo and major; I 
think they mean it) 

And they played and they sang and I 
wept, everything I ever knew, for 
Baroque music is keyed into Isaac New- 
ton’s kind of time; it’s the energy of 
that new explosion of philosophic time: 
perspective, mathematics, instant veloci- 
ty, the great clock, the great wheel, 
harmonies, the Great Godly Grid. 

Then the bushes whispered in succu- 
lent German O my heart, my heart. Out 
of my big griefs. My little songs. Inch- 
ing towards Einstein. Let me love, 
mother, let me lean on his bosom. I 
thought the frost-flowers on the win- 
dowpane meant Spring. 

Over here the Phoenix Reaction and 
God as Engineer. Over here entropy; 
suffering, death. And then the real Ein- 
stein, too complicated for me although I 
know what I’m supposed to like, 
Stravinsky and after; it makes my head 
ache, referring to things in all dimen- 
sions and sometimes backwards. And 
then it turns primitive, this is a bloody 
great dynamo and this a laboring flute. 
And then music-as-theatre. And round 
again. Round and round. 

All the music in the world says all 
the things in the world — I mean the 
universe, of course — and that’s every- 
thing there is. 

So it all cancels out. 

Sound the trumpet! 

It is. 



And let the listening hills rejoice. 

They are. 

I started up The Messiah but you 
have to be quite careful about Every 
valley because I’m near one and it 
might get ideas; I mean shall be exalted 
and there we go with an X-quake. 

Well, if it all goes round, it’s a spiral 
anyway — a four dimensional one 
(“hyper-spiral”) or like that theory of 
the four cosmi bongling into each other 
perpetually like ping-pong balls — matter 
with “forward” time, matter with 
“backward” time, antimatter with 
“forward time,” antimatter with 
“backward” time, only I think that 
would take five dimensions (six? seven? 
seventeen?) no, only three and Time, 
and you have to have ideal ping-pong 
balls because they never damp out. I 
like the older way better because I’m ir- 
responsible: forever and ever. Forever 
and ever. 

Forever and ever! 

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, 
hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hal- 
lelujah, hallelujah! Forever and ever. 

Quite a trick, for someone who 
doesn’t believe in God. 

Only Handel always makes me cry 
so. The people who walk in darkness, 
those who dwell in the land of the 
shadow of death, they all do a lot of 
crying. 

* * * 

Day. Sometime. I looked up and, you 
know, it wasn’t surprising, there’s 
another piece of my past come back; I 
am really not quite sure if this is 
another hallucination or only a memory, 
but by my knee at this moment there is 
a five-year-old little girl standing in 
gray trousers, red cloth shoes, and a 
blue cotton polo shirt. Wearing what the 
gilded youth of Empire would have

GALAXY 



worn on the playing fields a hundred 
and sixty years ago. More or less. She 
is the only child I ever knew who was 
named after an airport. 

I said, “Kennedy?” 

No answer. She died in a car crash 
years ago but Marilyn lived. Marilyn’s 
her mother. Three months in hospital: 
broken ribs, a broken arm, concussion, 
two operations on her knees, broken 
bones in her face. 

Kennedy died twenty minutes after 
the crash. She was unrecognizable. I 
mean they could tell who she was only 
by her size; there was another child, 
someone else’s, in the car, and Marilyn 
had another daughter. The other child 
wasn’t hurt, only bruised. The inflation 
bags didn’t open for some reason; 
people thrown about the inside of a 
steel can. They had to cut the car often. 

She’s put her hand on my knee. But I 
can’t feel it. 

Silence. I said, “Kennedy, you were 
quite obnoxious when you were alive. 
You were a screamer. You used to steal 
my needle and scissors to fight beasts 
with when you visited. You lifted up 
your voice and complained and when I 
took them back, you kicked me." 

Silence. She has no expression. Not 
grave, not gay. Interested, perhaps? No, 
she’s only looking at me. 

“Have you come to get me?” 1 said. 

Silence. That same almost intent — yet 
not intent — gaze. 

She must have something to tell me. 
Otherwise why come all that way? If 
she had lived two weeks longer she 
would have gone from daycare to 
school and she was rather proud of that 
because she was one of the very few 
children (the only elegance she could 
parade) who had a single mother and 
not eight mothers or five dads or a mix 
of mothers and dads or two dads or 



three mothers, and she was great friends 
with a little boy named Harold, who 
had a single father. 

“Where’s Harold?” I say to her. 

Silence. She was anxious, rather ob- 
sessed with growing up, very fierce in 
defending her rights, and her death 
nearly killed her mother. 

I tried. “Marilyn — ” 

She put her hand again on my knee 
and this time I felt it, a thrill, a fear, a 
warning, that insistent, communicating, 
hot-damp little hand. 

A gateway. A sign. A messenger. 
Though nothing’s settled. Fill in all the 
standard things about living being dying 
and the questions making the answers, 
everyone’s dying all the time, dying is 
life, &c., &c. But I still don’t know 
anything. 

This is not Kenny, who is drifting 
towards the door of the cave without a 
backward glance at me, like the night 
Marilyn was brought into hospital and I 
kept seeing her standing between two 
rooms, a lit one and a dark one, but 
they were both empty. Turning softly 
and vaguely from one to the other, and 
both empty. I still don’t understand 
that. , I mean, both empty. 

Kenny was always so fierce in life: 
squinch lines around her eyes, thin 
mouth either distended or twisted, 
cheeks blown out with rage, sucked in 
for gloom. She was never still; you 
could never measure the proportions of 
her face. 

I guess I ought to follow her out, 
throw myself over the cliff. Can’t, 
though. I’d only roll down like an idiot 
or a thistle and get impaled on some- 
thing; I can’t jump any more. I’ve 
printed out most of this and put it in the 
tin box; I’m wearing the rest of it 
around my neck. Pushed the box into 
the back cave wall because it’s going to

fall soon. I mean in a few hundred 
years or so, sometime, it’s clear it will. 

The splendid sun, lighting up the 
world. The lit room. The empty room. 

I will record a few last words, try to 
think of something significant, and 
since after that concert — everything’s 
ringing still — there’s not much else to 
do. I mean. 1 mean 1 will not. Since I 
don’t care. Thank God it's over. Odd to 
look back and see how much should 
have been changed, but one forgets the 
everydayness of it and the reasons why; 
I don’t suppose I did better with the 
room than most or worse or whatever. I 
mean if they make you rent it unfur- 
nished, you see. 

An afterlife: that would be nice, I 
suppose. 

No. Better not. 

Time. Time to go. Which way: in- 
stant, euphoric, religious, sleep, 
trancelike— really nowadays you’d think 
one was shopping for couch covers. 1 
think I'll leave them all behind, pity not 
to get to the real thing at last after all 
this trouble. I can muster up a jump. I 
can roll off the cliff, maybe bump my 
head, maybe die of thirst; lost of de- 
lirium, dirty my pants, interesting stuff, 
my whole past or something. The 
natural method. 

I’m going to do a joke; I will put as 
the last words on this. Oh 1 see people 
in uniforms coming through the brush 
downstream; someone’s coming to res- 
cue me. Goddam. 

And there they are! Coming through 
the brush — almost at the horizon, I 
think, but in white — people in white, as 
if they were the survey team for this 
tagged, unfurnished house — and they’re 
following the line of the river. Six of 
them. Coming this way. What a 
damned nuisance, I will have to be 
alive again, how exasperating. 



Bet you believed it. 

Told you, joke. 

Can’t remember worrying about this. 
This dying. Can’t remember. Why? 
Will put the print-out away, wait for the 
hill to bury it, and keep the vocoder. 
Such immense kindness from the hill. 
Nice hill, Nice sun (setting behind a 
bush someplace). So friendly, all this 
strange world, really. Walls. Floor. As- 
tonishingly put together. 

* * * 

I’ve done it. But kept the vocoder. 
And I have to be near the box or you 
won’t find it. Whoever you are. It’s the 
loneliness, really. Marilyn still alive 
somewhere, that’s the ghastly thing. 
I’ll do it the instant way, I suppose, just 
to be finished with it. Get it all over, all 
that dying. Long dying: long, long dy- 
ing, forty-two years, that’s too much 
and I really wish

If only I can get into it right, fit 
right. You know. I’ve got the ampoule 
in my hand, only have to break it. Skin 
contact.

Eternity as a bath house full of spi- 
ders (but he was nuts)

humanity longs to awaken

I didn’t plan it this way, but 
by golly I believe I’ve got a theme 
for this month’s collection of ram- 
blings, or at least some of them. As I 
was arraying the current pile of 
Books Read on my desk (read: bed) 



to select the first victim, it occurred 
to me that at least four of them fell 
under the heading of "pure 
entertainment” — and it then occur- 
red to me, reviewing those four 
books in my mind, that there’s no 
such thing. 

Now I maintain that the FIRST 
thing sf should be is entertaining. A 
writer must keep that hypothetical 
reader out there turning the pages, 
or he’s masturbating. But I also 
maintain that once he’s got the 
reader listening, he not only ought 
to have something to say, he can’t 
help saying something, albeit in 
spite of himself. Every book has a 
theme, stated or implied. (John 
Campbell once said, if you can’t 
think of a good blurb for a story, 
bounce it.) 

Any plot that keeps you reading 
involves at least one moral choice, 
usually several. Some of these are 



BOOKSHELF 



125 



labeled good (a "hero” makes 
them) and some are labeled "bad" 
(a "villain” makes them); and the 
reader is encouraged if not solicited 
to ratify the writer’s labeling by 
rooting for the heroes and/or booing 
the villains. 

It (hopefully) gets more subtle 
than that at times, of course, and 
there are variants. The writer may 
feel, for instance, that there is no 
elegant, or even acceptable, solution 
to his proposed moral dilemma, and 
seek your agreement. There are 
even books which propose no dis- 
cernible moral dilemma at all, paint- 
ing all characters the same shade of 
gray — but these are never, in the fi- 
nal analysis, entertaining. (Dhalgren 
is such a book. 1 rest my case.) 

But even there you and I are be- 
ing asked to agree to something: to 
the proposition that there are no 
moral dilemmas, let alone valid solu- 
tions. A book is a proposed agree- 
ment, between writer and reader. 
Harlan Ellison, in his preface to the 
magnificent Deathbird Stories (see 
June, 1975 Galaxy Bookshelf) says 
something to the effect that if 
enough people get together and 
agree that a thing is so, it comes to 
pass: men make, and unmake, their 
own gods. If that’s so, perhaps we 
all ought to be pretty goddam care- 
ful what agreements we make these 
days. 

If that’s so, perhaps I as a re- 
viewer have an obligation to com- 
ment on the moral agreements being 
proposed to you in the books I re- 



view, when they strike me as odd. 
In addition, of course (for I don’t 
want to preach at you), to discus- 
sing their craftsmanship. 

* * ★ 

Let’s look at the best of the four 
that disturbed me this way. 

Alfred Bester is an unquestioned 
master of entertainment, one of the 
most powerfully engaging writers of 
this or any genre. He once (about 
ten seconds after we were intro- 
duced, actually) took me by the 
lapels and told me that "The way to 
write is to take your reader by the 
lapels on page one and punch him 
repeatedly in the face until your arm 
is tired," or words to that effect. 
"Attack,” he cried, shaking me like 
a pitcher of martinis (which at the 
moment I chanced to be), ‘‘is 
paramount. ” 

This was no real surprise. I had 
of course read The Demolished Man 
(the world’s first Hugo) and the 
immortal The Stars My Destination, 
two of the most successfully am- 
bitious novels ever penned, and so I 
already knew that Alfie likes to 
leave ’em breathless and dizzy. 

And so it’s neither any surprise to 
find that, after a nineteen-year ab- 
sence from sf and writing in gener- 
al, Alfie’s done it again. The Com- 
puter Connection will grab your in- 
terest, all right — by the plums. 

Connection may be likened to a 
series of bladders in the face, mice 
in the ladies’ room, firecrackers in 



126

the sleeping bag, it may even actu- 
ally be the genuine Barrel Of Mon- 
keys for all I know. Its cast is a 
demented parade of zanies ranging 
from “Captain Nemo,” who barges 
through the door in a deep-sea di- 
ver’s suit filled with water (he 
breathes it for preference); through 
Jesus Christ himself (a hopelessly 
sincere neurotic who keeps getting 
himself crucified one way or 
another — his friends call him Jacy 
because “his real name sounds like 
swearing”); to a delightfully pubes- 
cent young lady named (for ridicu- 
lous reasons) Fee-5 Grauman’s 
Chinese. Altogether a gloriously 
outrageous farce — that is every bit 
as thrilling and chilling as it is 
hilarious. I mean, it’s tour de force 
kinda stuff. 

I read it last year when it was 
serialized in Analog under the title 
“The Indian Giver,” and was ut- 
terly delighted, certain I’d just 
finished a Hugo-class novel. Hear- 
ing trade rumors of a significant 
rewrite job, I re-read the new 
hardcover edition (it is, by the way, 
the same book advertised as “Ex- 
tro ” in the new edition of The Stars 
My Destination — of the three titles, 

I like the present one least) and, 
having only one of the three 
Analogs around (sorry, Ben), I 
failed to spot the rewrite from 
memory. But I was again en- 
chanted, hilarified and exhausted, 
and put the thing down intending to 
recommend in these pages that it be. 
nominated for a Hugo at once. 



Then my wife Jeanne asked me 
“What’s the book about?” in the 
tone of voice which means not what 
is the plot? but what's he got to 
say? And I opened my mouth and 
nothing came out. 

After a long search of my recol- 
lections of the double-reading, I fi- 
nally decided that Computer Con- 
nection mainly says: a) psychotic 
immortals who attempt to destroy 
the human race oughta be stopped, 
and b) a human (even an immortal) 
can’t be trusted with absolute pow- 
er, but a hermaphrodite can. The 
first of these I can’t quarrel with, 
but it don’t dazzle; the second daz- 
zles but J’m not sure I buy it. I 
have here a whole block of copy 
explaining and supporting the above 
two assertions, but I ain’t gonna 
type it up because it necessarily 
gives away a bunch of the plot, 
which is too good to spoil. Take my 
word for them. 

Along the way, less central agree- 
ments are sought. Alfie asserts in 
passing, for instance, that murder- 
ing people in particularly horrible 
ways, in a bungled attempt to make 
them immortal, is something you 
really ought to outgrow in a few 
hundred years or so; that True Love 
At First Sight between two total 
strangers with nothing (even lan- 
guage) in common will work out 
just peachy; that it’s okay for In- 
dians to sell hideous drugs extracted 
from the Ugly Poppy (!) as long as 
they only sell them to Honkies (just 
desserts, right?); and that Black/ 



BOOKSHELF 



127 



Spanish-flavored English will be the 
language of tomorrow’s illiterate 
yahoos. All of these you might 
want to think about for a minute. 

Now none of this is to say that 
Connection is not one of the most 
exciting, hilarious, purely entertain- 
ing novels I’ve ever read in my life. 
But 1 think I’ll wait just a while be- 
fore nominating it for the Hugo, af- 
ter all. 

★ * ★ 

Keith Laumer’s Dinosaur Beach 
is another case in point. It too ap- 
peared in Analog (in 1969, as “The 
Timesweepers’ ’), and it too is a 
highly entertaining book — of a dif- 
ferent sort than Alfie’s. Keith writes 
teasers, puzzlers, masterfully-plotted 
suspense stories whose strong points 
are action and really ingenious sur- 
prises. In the typical Laumer story, 
a tough if not indomitable pro- 
tagonist fights forces beyond his (or 
your) comprehension which increase 
in complexity and deadliness until 
they are explained/defeated in the 
last twenty pages. It’s an old for- 
mula and a good one, and it’s never 
been done better than in this latest 
avatar. There are so many cliff- 
hanger blackouts it makes you diz- 
zy, and the pace never lets up. 
Time-travel is centrally involved, 
and Keith has been exploring the 
possible paradoxes of time-travel for 
so long he could confuse the hero 
of “All You Zombies.” The prize- 
at-stake in the protagonist’s struggle 



is literally the fabric of reality itself, 
and by damn you can’t get much 
heavier than that. 

I read through Beach at a pheno- 
menal speed, even considering its 
extreme shortness (151 pp.). “Well 
sir,” I said when 1 was done, “now 
that was pure entertainment, beauti- 
fully done.” 

And again I caught up short on 
some subconscious assumptions I’d 
been tacitly agreeing with. One of 
the most basic assumptions of 
Keith’s plot is that humans can’t be 
trusted to monkey with time-travel, 
that their attempts to do so will 
bring disaster no matter how good 
or bad their intentions. Another as- 
sumption is that machines can be 
trusted to monkey with time travel 
(do sf writers trust anybody but a 
human?), so long as they haven’t 
been hanging around humans long 
enough to acquire a survival-urge. 
Keith also seems to say that the best 
a woman field operative can be is a 
darned good imitation of a male 
agent with a “frightened little girl 
inside,” who is prone to “go 
female on” you in a pinch. 

Again, I’m not saying I disliked 
the book — I recommend it as light 
reading. But I stubbed my toe a 
couple of times, and I rather hope 
you do too. 

So much for the ones that I 
thought were well-written, but sub- 
tly disturbing. Now for the one that 
was mediocre and infuriating. 

There was time, back in me 
teens, when I read every Andre

Norton I could get my hands on,

Ptooey. 

She has taken mighty Merlin and 
noble Arthur and the lovely Guine- 
vere and the Lady of the Lake and 
made them into the comical stooges 
of two races of aliens who have 
been using Earth as a battleground, 
off and on, for centuries. These Sky- 
Lords, see, swing low in their 
Chariots of the Gods from time to 
time to build Stonehenge, destroy 
Atlantis, and occasionally sneak 
into the boudoirs of certain human- 
type ladies to. .well. .impregnate 
them, so that the resulting hybrid 
offspring can slug it out with each 
other for the minds and destinies of 
mankind. By Ms. Norton, this is 
just fine. Merlin and Arthur turn out 
to be the Great Human Hope of 
Race A (who therefore become the 
good guys), whose agents quite lit- 
erally rape M&A’s mothers to pro- 
duce half-breed tools to use against 
Race B. The grand plan is hide- 
ously bungled, largely through poor 
intelligence- work and astonishing 
naivete on the part of Race A, and 
Arthur and Merlin are placed in 
suspended animation until a better 
time presents itself. Meanwhile, it 



is inferred, the evil influence of 
Race B goes on to make Earth the 
miserable mess we all know it is 
today. 

Only, I’m damned if I can see 
why I should root for Race A. Ms. 
Norton’s Arthur blithely' slaughters 
thousands of his countrymen, on the 
pretext that he is thereby “unifying 
his land” so that the aliens may 
safely reveal themselves — a patently 
idiotic notion in itself. Merlin is a 
poor twisted neurotic who spends 
all his maladjusted days in loneli- 
ness, monomania and celibacy (car- 
nal whoopee, it seems, interferes 
with your ability to use the Ancient 
Knowledge — unless you happen to 
be a horny Sky Lord). There is no 
single portrayal of sex as warm or 
loving or even honestly hedonis- 
tic — it is invariably treachous, 
guileful, evil, often only a trap to 
drain Merlin of his Vital Thaumatur- 
gical Fluids. Indeed, the only females 
in the book who aren’t bitches are 
Merlin’s and Arthur’s mommies — 
who, for their pains, are both of them 
literally screwed and then dropped 
from the story a couple of sentences 
after they have birthed their sons. 

But that Race B — they’re a bunch 
of blackguards. Do you know what 
they do? Why them bastards rape 
and kill and devastate, that’s what. 

Enough. A thoroughly unpleasant 
book, indifferently crafted, appar- 
ently calculated to appeal to the 
more twisted of the Von Daniken 
fans. It damn near spoiled the 
whole Arthur legend for me. But

I’m sure a quick browse through 
Le Morte D' Arthur will wash the 
taste of Merlin's Mirror right out of 
my mind. 

* * * 

And now for tAe one that was just 
plain rotten — and twice as infuriat- 
ing. 

I don’t believe I’ve read anything 
in the past year quite so frustrating 
as Amazon Planet. Dammit to hell, 
Mack Reynolds is not a klutz — you 
Galaxy readers recently named him 
Most Popular Author, and I have 
been enjoying his work since I was 
in grade school. And yet this latest 
chunk is, in spite of some thorough 
research and clever plotting, a 
genuine and unequivocal piece of 
limburger. It reads like a slick 
mainstream writer’s first attempt at 
sf. 

I must confess I expected it to 
stink from the moment I saw the ti- 
tle and absorbed the blurb. Get this, 
fellas: it’s about a planet where the 
women are warlike, muscular, 
domineering Amazons and the men 
are limp-wristed fags and second- 
class citizens. See the subtle satire 
in that? The biting social commen- 
tary? The relevance? The cheap, 
trite, hack sensationalism? 1 mean, 
you got the fag market, the dyke 
market, the S&M crowd, the 
feminists and the paranoids, all at 
once! I tell ya, Sid, it’s a natural. 

In spite of the fact that I’ve seen 
the identical premise used at least 
four times before ( every one of 

130 



them ghastly), I decided to read the 
book, solely on the strength of 
Mack’s reputation. For the first half 
of the book at least my outrage and 
despair grew ever stronger, as 
stumbling prose carried ancient 
stereotypes through an absurd and 
unbelievable charade. To give a 
minor example of the sloppiness of 
the writing, although it has been es- 
tablished that the hundreds of 
worlds in the United Planets federa- 
tion have no cultural contact, and 
indeed know very little about one 
another, natives of all planets seem 
coincidentally accustomed to shout, 
“Holy jumping Zen!” in times of 
stress, regardless of their own re- 
ligious affiliation (none of them ap- 
pears even remotely influenced by 
the precepts of Zen). 

Ah! But then, halfway through, 
Reynolds serves up a startling and, 
in retrospect, well-planted plot 
twist, which like a supercharger on 
a Model T makes the old wreck 
come alive for a bit. Amazonia 
never really was such a neurotic’s 
paradise, you see (well, for a time, 
but all that was years ago) — that’s 
just a story the Amazonians put out. 
My interest began to perk up. 

And from that one peak Amazon 
Planet went downhill so fast and so 
far that the slime-pit it started from 
ended up looking like Olympus. 
Amazonia, we learn, is in actuality 
quite a sane, stable little matrilineal 
society, with only vestigial, 
“merely symbolic” sexism. But the 
wise Amazonians knew all those 



GALAXY 



darn old male-dominated cultures 
would give them a hard time unless 
they were frightened away by a 
good threat to their masculinity — 
hence the “We fight all the time 
and keep our men in harems” 
false-front. To this world comes our 
hero, who seems at first like a 
complete wimp but is actually a 
secret agent with a heavy rep. 

Now see if any of this reminds 
you of anything you may have read 
in your newspapers lately: The hero 
(“Ronny”) works for a semisecret 
branch of United Planets (a federa- 
tion which is bound by law, mind 
you, to respect individual planetary 
autonomy) called Section G. The 
avowed purpose of Section G is to 
instigate the overthrow of any 



planetary government which it 
deems “restrictive,” by fomenting 
and financing rebellion from within 
(although they'll send in troops if 
all else fails)! “Restrictive” is de- 
fined as not tending to “encourage 
progress,” and -“Progress” is de- 
fined as, and I quote, “Scientific 
progress, industrial progress, pro- 
gress in education, in freeing the in- 
dividual from any restriction that 
prevents him from realizing his 
abilities.” Now isn’t that worth giv- 
ing up self-determination for? 

Dig it, these are the GOOD 
GUYS! In this holy cause Ronny 
savagely and mercilessly massacres 
everyone he meets in a building 
known to contain the enemy, 
whether they are armed or not,

bisecting a naked man in a shower, 
literally wading in gore. It’s neces- 
sary (and therefore OK), because 
Section G simply must get all the 
governments in the Galaxy working 
at peak efficiency (even at the cost 
of legitimacy), because. .well, it’s 
like this: they’ve spotted aliens 
coming this way from the next 
Galaxy, and want us to meet them 
from a position of strength. Surely 
you people can see why we have to 
draft you: them furriners coming 
over the hill might (although there 
isn’t a scrap of evidence to suggest 
it) be unfriendly. What’s a Constitu- 
tion or so in the face of a Genuine 
Potential Commie Menace? 

I'm getting carried away. I’ve 
some invective saved up to heap 
upon the silly and unworkable “real 
government of Amazonia’’; and 
the incredibly abundant typos; and 
the sentence structure that conveys 
information at the expense of grace; 
and the abominably sexist portrayal 
of women; and the waste of some 
extremely thorough if often dubious 
research; but I see I’ve already 
spent quite enough time on this tur- 
key. 

Are you beginning to see what I 
mean about “moral agreements”?

Another turkey, not quite as bad. 
I am informed by a friend in the 
trade that Police Your Planet first 
ran under the byline of one Erik van 
Lhin, in a magazine edited by Phil- 

132 



lip St. John, and was in due course 
favorably reviewed by Lester del 
Rey. That all three of these people 
are Lester should give you an idea 
of what a gem the book is. 

It has just appeared in paperback 
under the byline, “Lester del Rey 
& Erik van Lhin,” and adding Les- 
ter’s real name may sell more 
copies but it don’t make it smell 
any better. 

What it is, it’s a shoot-’em-up, a 
bad Western set on Mars. It moves 
nicely, as nicely as everything Les- 
ter writes, and if you really have a 
thing for crushed heads and buckets 
of blood it’ll please you on virtually 
every page. But only if you’re will- 
ing to buy into the premise that 
what to do about evil men is to be- 
come just as evil, but tougher. The 
“hero,” Bruce Gordon, is a sort of 
cross between Casablanca' s Mon- 
sieur Rick and Mike Hammer — a 
sadistic thug, sexually and-emotion- 
ally crippled — with a soft spot for 
the underdog. And so it’s all right 
for him to steal and kill and extort, 
because in the long run he won’t do 
it to anybody (except the Bad Guys, 
who wear uniforms so you can tell 
them) any more than he absolutely 
has to, to achieve his personal 
goals. In the end he learns that he’s 
been manipulated, played for a 
sucker, by an even more heartless 
and merciless bunch — another 
C.I.A. surrogate — who send him off 
to Mercury to clean up the owl- 
hoots there. 

Altogther an almost unrelievedly

grim, cynical, despairing view of 
mankind — quite competently 

crafted, I should add for any honest 
thud and blunder fans out there. 

* ★ * 

One last turkey, and then I’ll try 
and leave on an up-note (remember 
last month I promised a columnfull 
of turkeys one of these days?). 

Despite its pretentious title, I 
quite enjoyed the opening chapters 
of Science Fiction: What It’s All 
About. I did go into it grumbling 
that “a man who knows what sf is 
all about ought to be able to write a 
better book than 2018 A.D.” (see 
September, 1975 Galaxy Bookshelf 
for the autopsy), but as I read 
through chapters on the fantastic 
novel, the prehistory of sf from Lu- 
cian on up, and the Utopian novel 
past and present, I was charmed and 
impressed by Sam Lundwall’s wit 
and scholarship. 

But very soon he began touching 
on areas with which I am myself 
familiar — and in instance after in- 
stance I judged him to be full of 
beans. In an era in which it has be- 
come fashionable for lightweights to 
criticize Robert Heinlein, Lundwall 
distinguished himself (if that’s the 
word I want) by a series of the most 
hysterical, illogical, contradictory 
and incoherent attacks ever made on 
the man he reluctantly conceded to 
be (for unexplained reasons) a 
giant. He dismised Isaac Asimov as 
a guy who adapted Gibbon into a 



space-opera and wrote a bunch of 
Robot stories — and in a later chap- 
ter destroyed his credentials to dis- 
cuss even those latter tales by aver- 
ring that Susan Calvin is “so ge- 
nial’’ (forsooth!) “that you can’t 
dislike the robots she loves so dear- 
ly.” He loathes Star Trek in its en- 
tirety, dismissing it as “nothing but 
space opera.’’ He even thinks 
Eando Binder was one man. 

But worst and most unforgivable, 
Lundwall and/or Ace didn’t bother 
to update this new edition — it hasn’t 
been updated, despite an alleged 
“revision” in 1971, since it was 
first written in 1969. Which is to 
say that it claims that Amazing is 
still running nothing but reprints; 
implies that Fred Pohl is still editing 
Galaxy [No, I do not use “Jim 
Baen ” as a pseudonym. — Pohl]; 
claims that F&SF is “commonly 
considered” to be the “foremost 
U.S. sf magazine of today”; and, in 
an unbelievable piece de resistance 
of ironic ignorance, alleges that 
Analog is “. .still edited by the 
indestructible John W. Campbell” 
(whose name, by the way, appears 
for the first time in this “analysis” 
of sf on page 205 — although the 
first Index citation of him is for 
page 240) (every Index entry I’ve 
chanced to check is bollixed up 
some way or other). Fantastic, the 
late lamented Worlds of If, and the 
late Vertex are not even mentioned 
once. 

’Nuff said. Although he blasts the 
provinciality of Americans who as- 



BOOKSHELF 



133 



sume that sf is their genre, this 
book proves even more clearly than 
his last, that way over there in Swe- 
den, Sam Lundwall just don’t know 
What It’s All About. 

* * 

Finally, the up-note I promised 
you. Somewhat paradoxically, it’s 
from the same gentleman I took to 
task a few pages ago. 

Gods and Golems by Lester del 
Rey (published under his own ex- 
clusive byline) is a collection of five 
of the best stories Lester ever wrote 
or I ever read. In craftsmanship 
they are superb, in moral content 
they are admirable (to me and Les- 
ter, at least), and in sheer skill they 
are breathtaking. These are the real 
del Rey, the kind of stuff on which 
the man has built one of the 
strongest reputations in the busi- 
ness. They vary in age from eleven 
to twenty-three years old, but you’ll 
have to squint mighty hard to spot 
any wrinkles or stretch-marks. 

“Vengeance Is Mine” is a clas- 
sic tale of misguided vengeance; 
“Superstition’’ is an incredibly 
deftly-plotted tour de force about a 
race of psi-masters who have daily 
chats with god, though he is stone 
dead; “Life Watch” is an excellent 
analysis of what it truly means to be 
human; “For I Am A Jealous 
People” is the most amazing blend 
of sf and theology imaginable, with 
one of the greatest last lines in liter- 
ary history; and “Pursuit’’ is an 



agonizingly compelling spell-binder 
concerning the greatest danger of 
psi -phenomena to humans. 

On the scale I inaugurated last 
month for story-collections, Gods 
And Golems rates a clear 100% — I 
found every story in it to be enter- 
taining, instructive, enlightening, 
and impossible to put down un- 
finished. If you’ve never read Les- 
ter at his best, trot out and score it. 
A Best Buy. 

* * * 

One last word before I let you all 
turn to the fiction, which God 
knows has been waiting patiently 
for long enough. When I took this 
gig, I had mental visions of my 
mailbox overflowing with bombs, 
rattlesnakes and poison-pen letters. 
I’m dismayed to say I haven’t heard 
a peep for months. I got my first 
letter this morning, in fact, from a 
delightful anonymous reader who al- 
lowed that everything I say is horse- 
shit but I say it purty. Look, to 
do a proper job of this, I need 
feedback — as direct as I can get it. 
By virtue of living on a farm out in 
the boonies, I’m out of touch with 
the current of Pro and Fan opinion. 
So whether you are a reader or a 
victim of this column, feel free to 
send either hearty agreement or vo- 
ciferous dispute regarding same to 
me, at Moonrise Hill, R.R. # 2, 
Hampton, Nova Scotia BOS 1L0. 

At least until further notice. ★

Archives — after having installed 
$4500.00 worth of intercom equip-

my imperious commands via the tv 
intercom, and I need a copy of the 
Hugo nominations for this year’s fi- 
nal ballot. 

Let’s see now. .my God, did I 
forget my keys? No, there they 
are. Slide the bolts, the chains,

Ah. 

The place is like a tomb! Could

“Alter? Alter?" Oh, God, what 
would I do without him? Who 
would 1 blame for my mistakes? 
Who would 1 revile and argue with? 
“ALTER? ALTER EGO?” 

He’s dead! I know he’s dead!

Oh, Arrrrrgh! *Sob* I’ll find his 
small, crumpled body in one of the 
aisles. .so still, so quiet. No more 
caustic repartee. No more smirking 
exchanges. No more diatribes! 
*Whimper* 

I should have treated him better. 
I should have even complimented 
him. Oh, woe. *Snivel. 
snivel. .* 

“Geis, what the hell are you do- 
ing down here? What are you 
sniveling about? Run short of 
french-vanila with cherries ice 
cream and peach brandy this 
month? Times are tough.” 

“Alter! You’re not dead!” 

“When I’m finally dead, Geis, 
you’ll be the first to know— you 
won't be able to write a line of fic- 
tion or non-fiction worth a damn.” 
“Where were you? Why didn't 
you answer my call?" 

“I was hot-wiring the intercom

you had installed. You’d be sur- 
prised what can be done with one 
of these things.” 

‘‘Alter — damn it, you’re sup- 
posed to be under control. You’re 
supposed to be subservient to the 
surface me! Why can’t you be- 
have?” 

“I dunno, Geis. I guess you’re 
just lucky. Now, why are you down 
here? You didn’t bring any more 
visitors, did you? No more sight- 
seers unless they’re old-fashioned 
women in young bodies.” 

“Alter, 1 promise — no more vis- 
itors. And let’s not get into sexism 
and chauvinisnm, hmm?” 

“Haw. Don’t get into it, he says. 
Geis, you were born into it, you live 
in it and you’ll die in it. As for 
the future of the women’s lib — that 
will depend on macroeconomic fac- 
tors more than cultural or societal fac- 
tors. The shape of the family to come 
depends on science, technology and 
the state of our natural resources. If 
the trend is toward a lowering of the 
standard of living due to the absolute 
increase in the costs of necessities, 
then a lot of ‘ideas whose time has 
come’ may find their time has gone. ” 

“Alter, did I ask you for an opin- 
ion? Go find me a copy of the 
Hugo ballot for this year. Jim Baen, 
exalted slave-drive editor of this 
magazine, wants me to discuss the 
contenders.” 

“Ha. *smirk* A likely story. 
You just want to get into print that 
you are up for two — TWO — Hugos 
this year.” 



“Nope. Never crossed my mind. 
Of course, now that you mention it, 
I am on the ballot for Best Fan Writ- 
er and THE ALIEN CRITIC (now 
known as SCIENCE FICTION RE- 
VIEW) is up for Best Fan 
Magazine.” *Blush* 

“Geis, your disengenuity will get 
you killed one of these years.” 

“My mentioning it will not influ- 
ence the voting, since this column 
will not see print until long after the 
Aussiecon in Melbourne where the 
Worldcon is being held this year. 
So go find me a copy of the ballot. 
I’ve got to get on with this.” 

“Alright, alright. This 
way. ...” 

“Ugh. .the dirt. .crud. 
Don’t you ever clean these aisles?” 
“They’re as clean as your mind, 
Geis. Don’t complain. Here. No. 
A copy of the first issue of 
PSYCHOTIC wouldn’t do, would 
it?” 

“No! Don’t you have any organi- 
zation, Alter?” 

“I keep telling myself. .‘Alter, 
one of these days you’re going to 
have to get organized.’ It helps 
while I’m looking for things. 
How about this tattered copy of 
THE ENCHANTED DUPLICA- 
TOR?” 

“The Hugo ballot. 1 ’’ 

“Why are you so particular? 
Here. .yes, here’s a copy. Now go 
up to your privileged position on 
the surface and forget me again.” 
“A pleasure!”

place. The chains. The 
locks. He’s an impossible crea- 
ture. What is that he’s shouting 
through the door? Something about 
. .turning the intercom terminal 
into a. .into a matter transmitter? 
No. No, could never be done. 

Could it? I’d better write Jerry 
Pournelle and get his opinion. Alter 
Ego on the loose with a matter 
transmitter is a prospect too horrible 
to contemplate. 

Well, in the meantime, up I go to 
the surface for a look at this ballot. 

Let’s see now. Best Novel. 
The nominated are: 

THE DISPOSSESSED by Le 
Guin 

FIRE TIME by Anderson 

FLOW MY TEARS, THE 
POLICEMAN SAID by Dick 

THE INVERTED WORLD by 
Priest 

THE MOTE IN GOD’S EYE by 
Niven & Pournelle. 

The contest is between THE 
DISPOSSESSED and THE MOTE 
IN GOD’S EYE. They are both ex- 
cellent novels, superb science fic- 
tion. I expect MOTE to win if 
enough of the voters have read it. It 
is old-fashioned space war, the- 
fate-of-mankind-hangs-in-the-balance, 
with strong plot elements and in- 
triguing premise. It is very high in 
reader entertainment. 

THE DISPOSSESSED is a more 
low-key, ‘mature’ story, involving 
the fate of one man and his home 
world. It deals with character, com- 
peting ideals, the rich and the poor. 



Both novels, to be honest, drag 
in places. MOTE has more narrative 
tension. THE DISPOSSESSED has 
more inherent status as ‘quality’ sf. 

Another factor is that Ursula K. 
Le Guin has been winning awards 
hand over fist lately, and the fans 
tend to say ‘Enough, already’ and 
give awards to someone else for 
awhile. 

The Best Novella line-up is: 

“Assault on a City” by Vance 

“Bom With the Dead” by Siver- 
berg 

“Riding the Torch” by Spinrad 

“A Song for Lya” by Martin 

“Strangers” by Dozois. 

Readership counts here, I think, 
and name recognition. So Silverberg 
has the edge, with the ANALOG 
readership remembering Martin’s 
story and perhaps voting enough on 
that basis to make the differ- 
ence. .even though in my opin- 
ion “A Song for Lya” is only a 
so-so story. “Riding the Torch” by 
Spinrad deserves equal praise and 
status with “Bom With the Dead” 
in my view. Alas, I have not read 
the Vance or the Dozois. 

I have only read two of the 
novelettes on the ballot, so I cannot 
with justice make any comment at 
all. 

But justice has little to do with 
life, so I will, anyway. 

They are: 

‘‘Adrift Just Off the Islets of 
Langerhans” by Ellison 

‘‘After the Dreamtime” by 
Lupoff 



138 



GALAXY 



“A Brother to Dragons, a Com- 
panion to Owls” by Wilhelm 
“Extreme Prejudice’’ by Pour- 
nelle 

“Midnight by the Morphy 
Watch” by Leiber 
“Nix Olympica” by Walling 
“That Thou Art Mindful of 
Him” by Asimov 
Harlan Ellison cannot write unin- 
terestingly. His stories always grab 
and twist even if they insult the 
canons of sf and maul plausibility. 
This doesn’t seem to bother the 
readers or Harlan. He has a good 
chance to win. 

So does Fritz Leiber with his 
memorable, semi-classic fantasy. 
And everyone loves Fritz. 

The short stories are: 
“Cathadonian Odyssey” by 
Bishop 

“The Day Before the Revolu-

With Tim Kirk in the pro ranks

Ben Bova 
Terry Carr 
Ed Ferman 
Robert Silverberg 
Ted White 

The obvious winner will most 
likely be Ben Bova again; he con- 
tinues to do a good job with 
ANALOG and the overpowering 
impact of the magazine on the vot- 
ing will probably result in another 
Hugo. 

Certainly a Special Mention 
should go to Jim Baen for Best 
New Editor. 

Ted White should get the annual 
Hang In There award.

SF COMMENTARY 

STARLING 

If the power of circulation pre- 
vails, the race is between TAC, 
ALGOL, and LOCUS. But SF 
COMMENTARY is an Australian 
zine, and if the Aussies vote for 
Bruce Gillespie’s prestigious and 
serious (yet readable) SF COM- 
MENTARY it may squeak through. 
This may be Bruce’s only chance, 
since he seems to have burned him- 
self out. 

Those nominated as Best Fan 
Writer are; 

John Bangsund 
Dick Geis 
Sandra Miesel 



Don Thompson 

Susan Wood 

John Bangsund has withdrawn. 
That leaves me against two women 
and Don Thompson. Susan Wood 
won last year, and it’s never hap- 
pened that Best Fan Writer winners 
repeat. I won in 1971. Of course 
Galaxy’s 80,000-plus readership 
won’t have any effect. 

Read my next column and find 
out who won and what I’ve got to 
say about all the above categories. 
Including the last category — 

Best Dramatic Presentation; 
FLESH GORDON 
PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE 
THE QUESTOR TAPES 
YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN 
ZARDOZ 

My vote went to THE QUESTOR 
TAPES. I can’t see a Hugo for 
FLESH GODON as much as I like 
the men behind the cameras, or go- 
ing to ZARDOZ. YOUNG FRAN- 
KENSTEIN would be a respectable 
winner. I haven’t seen PHANTOM 
OF THE PARADISE. 

The Best Dramatic category has 
been somewhat of a so- what award 
since its beginning. The winners are 
usually people who are outside-the- 
family and could care less about 
winning a Hugo. I have never seen 
an ad that proclaimed, ‘The 
Hugo- Winning Picture. .’ 

Outside the sf world, a Hugo is 
small beer. 

I think the category should be 
abolished. Let’s have a Best SF 
Columnist Hugo instead.

“From me, Geis.”

the stench of burning tendrils,

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT

He was a master of 
illusions — reality he 
found more difficult 
to deal with. 



The room stank, but then of 
course it should. Fourteen months’ 
accumulation of straw on the floor 
of a drinking hall: spilled ale, stale 
urine, rotten cheese and vomitus — 
all told their sordid tales. 

Castles should be vacated from 
time to time so that the warders can 
shovel out accumulated filth and let 
a season of fresh air purge the 
stone. Keep Ahnlich was well into 
its second winter of continuous 
habitation. Storymaker knew this 
well; he was surprised that the smell 
should suddenly intrude. 

“There’s treachery afoot,’’ Mal- 
reve rumbled, scowling into his 
bowl. “Vile treachery.’’ He 

STORYMAKER 



plunged his nose into foam, as if to 
sniff out a lurking villain, 
Storymaker shrugged. 

“Of course there is.” They had 
covered this ground too many times 
during the recent weeks of inactivi- 
ty. “When armed force fails as a 
tool of statecraft, there’s naught left 
but treachery.” He sipped his wa- 
tery ale. “The King’s cousins were 
practiced back-stabbers long before 
they tried their hands at being gen- 
erals.” 

Funny, he had never noticed be- 
fore what an insipid brew this ale 
was. 

Tomson sat quietly, sampling his 
bowl from time to time and taking 
in their every word. His eager 
brown eyes darted from speaker to 
speaker, though they were no longer 
rounded in awe at such casual talk 
of the fate of monarchs. With every 
month had he grown in poise and 
perception; the lad was nigh on to 
becoming a man of full measure. 
Storymaker had shared many an ad- 
venture with him, these past 
months, and had come to love him 
like a brother. 

Malreve caught his eye, reached 
behind it to capture the thought, as 
only a companion of many cam- 
paigns can do. He scowled his 
blackest scowl. 

Strange how Storymaker could 
read concern couched in his friend’s 
ill-temper. But then it was strange 
that he, the wiry teller of bright 

143 



tales, should remain so long at the 
side of a hulk so taciturn and 
gloomy as Malreve. 

“We’ll have to be moving on 
soon, you know.’’ A glance at 
Tomson. “We’ll have to leave all 
this behind.” The glance conveyed a 
message that Storymaker refused to 
accept. 

“We still owe service to the 
King,” he replied. “Even for mer- 
cenaries we have been well paid.” 
Then, almost defiantly, “We must 
linger yet awhile. These people 
need us now more than ever.” 

“Aye. They need us, but can we 
come through?” He tossed off his 
brew, slammed the empty bowl 
down on the oaken planks. 

“Wench!” He slammed the 
bowl again for emphasis. 

“Every day our army shrinks. 
Those that don’t desert die of the 
Sickness, or in some stupid drunken 
brawl. Have you seen what’s hap- 
pened to discipline? Some of the 
cockier louts are even starting to 
answer back to me — me! 

“Where in Seven Hells is that 
girl?” Malreve roared in sudden 
exasperation. 

It was all true, and Malreve’s un- 
characteristic loquaciousness under- 
lined the gravity of the situation. 
There were winter crops to tend — it 
was hard to blame peasants for car- 
ing more about a full belly come 
spring than about a fat king’s family 
squabbles. They had no way of 
grasping the long term conse- 
quences of his defeat. 



Siege decimated a fighting force 
slowly, but just as surely as pitched 
battle. The two mercenaries had 
worked wonders with the rabble of 
peasant farmers they were given, 
making it into the most effective 
army, man for man, between the 
mountains and the sea. But disci- 
pline so quickly imposed evaporated 
just as quickly with no new vic- 
tories to savor. 

They were not, in actual fact, 
under direct siege. The Ducal Al- 
liance chose rather to ring in the 
vast South valley over which the 
Keep held sway. But nowhere could 
the perimeter be pushed outward by 
frontal assault, not without grievous 
loss of life. And no man could pass 
the encircling camps without facing 
death, or swearing allegiance to the 
Dukes. Tempting bribes to defectors 
made desertion a real problem. Yes, 
something would have to be done to 
improve discipline, Storymaker de- 
cided, and soon. Maybe he 
could . 

The thought was interrupted by 
the entrance of Lit, the serving 
wench. Her belly was well rounded 
now and she carried her burden 
with stately pride. It was 
Storymaker’s child. 

She also earned a pitcher. 

“It’s about time,” Malreve mut- 
tered. His manner made clear that 
he was keeping a strong curb on his 
temper. Malreve took his drinking 
seriously; he disliked interruptions 
in the smooth flow of alcohol from 
pitcher to bowl to belly. Once, in 



144 



GALAXY 



Marberry, he had dragged a tardy 
serving wench back from her brief 
squat in the alley, skirts still hiked 
around her waist and both hands 
clawing to free her hair from his 
fist. Everyone had laughed uproari- 
ously at his impatience and the 
girl’s predicament. Everyone, that 
is, but Story maker. 

He was continually rufning good 
help, by Malreve’s standards. Find 
a wench who was pleasing to the 
eye and properly cowed, and right 
away Storymaker would start mak- 
ing a fuss over her and treating her 
like a lady. Such treatment invari- 
ably led to disastrous interruptions 
of service. The girls began putting 
on airs, following Storymaker 
around like lovesick pups, and mak- 
ing themselves generally unavailable 
to the rest of the clientele. It was 
disgusting. 

Malreve knew better than to try 
to cure his friend of this bad habit; 
for Storymaker, oddly enough, took 
his women as seriously as some 
men took their drink. Once, in Av- 
alon, there had been a girl, a stable 
cleaner by trade. An ostler chose 
her for a quick one, not knowing 
anyone lay private claim to her 
favors. (He would have scarce be- 
lieved it had he been told.) It cost 
him his testicles. 

Lit filled bowls all around, linger- 
ing but for a second at Storymaker’ s 
side. Only a fool Would have failed 
to notice the ill-temper clouding the 
room. Serving girls, even those ac- 
customed to special treatment, 



learned early to keep clear of sour 
patrons. It took but a casual swipe 
of a beringed hand to remove a 
girl’s front teeth and lower her mar- 
ket value. Serenely but swiftly she 
waddled out. Storymaker felt a re- 
newed surge of pride at this visible 
proof of his manhood. 

How Lit’s mother, the crone 
charged with running the drinking 
hall, had protested when she found 
her principal helper saddled with a 
swelling belly. Loud was her wail- 
ing as she berated Storymaker for 
the inconvenience he had caused 
her. The scene had been a source of 
much amusement to the other drink- 
ers; everyone knew she was secretly 
pleased that the get would be the 
child of a warrior — one in the 
King’s counsel at that. 

A boy so bom might well hope to 
rise above his station. He would 
certainly be uncommon fair and 
quick. And even a girl by 
Storymaker could expect an easier 
path through life. 

It seeped into Storymaker’s 
awareness that he never saw himself 
in this child’s future. He was cer- 
tainly not the marrying kind, but he 
had a fondness for watching his bas- 
tards through their infancy. Only 
when he was sure that mother and 
child were doing well would he ac- 
cede to Malreve’s impatient demand 
to move on. Yet somehow he knew 
that this child he would never see. 
The strange sense of certainty de- 
pressed his spirits beyond measure. 

With a physical shrug he threw 



STORYMAKER 



145 



off the gloom. He caught Tomson’s 
ever-watchful eye, smiled. 

“Did I ever tell you of the time 
we rode the dragons into battle 
through the sky? It was over the 
kingdom of the Bretons, was it not, 
Malreve?” The lad brightened at 
the prospect of another story from 
the master himself. Even if he had 
heard it a hundred times (and he 
had not heard this one even once), 
he would have said nothing to de- 
flect Storymaker from a tale. Real 
dragons that flew! The most improb- 
able lies always had the best plots. 

Skillfully, Storymaker built the 
tale. Layer upon layer piled the 
fancies, yet always with that aura of 
believability about them that made 
one want to swallow the concoction 
whole. Legions by the thousand 
strove for dominion over vast king- 
doms. The Spitters of Fire spat 
flaming brands at their riders’ beck 
that slayed men and beasts for 
leagues around. What wonder there 
was in it all! What glory to be had! 

The ending spun out, was tied 
off, snipped. The maker of stories 
drained his bowl to wet his parched 
throat, leaned back to bask in the si- 
lent admiration of his small audi- 
ence. Even Malreve looked less 
sour that was his wont. A good 
thing, it was often said, that 
Storymaker was only half as good 
at soldiering as he was at telling 
tales — else where would be the need 
for armies? 

“Come, my friends,’’ said 
Storymaker, “Let us exit this dank 



hole and enjoy the sunshine while it 
should last.” His gloom was all but 
forgotten. “Malreve, my good 
friend, we can look over your surly 
legion, and perhaps knock a few 
heads together as a general lesson, 
hey?” 

The prospect of a good fight was 
one of the few lures that would 
draw the burly one from his drink. 
He rose with a toothy grin. 

As storymaker drew his compan- 
ions out the door, a hand clasped to 
the neck of each, he felt again that 
lurch of strangeness. That tale he 
had just told — so out of place in 
this world of stone walls and 
crossbows. Such an imagination he 
had! His dreams often seemed more 
like reality than this solid rock it- 
self. 

* * * 

“Pikes are all in order, Sire,” 
the toothless cripple sprayed. He 
was like a hound in his eagerness to 
please his master on this unexpected 
visit. Storymaker nodded accep- 
tance, but was careful with his in- 
spection all the same. The old man, 
a veteran of too many battles in- 
volving blunt weapons, would do 
his job all the more faithfully know- 
ing that his work was checked and 
appreciated. The post was a reward 
for long years of faithful service, 
but still it was important. 

Locking up weapons between bat- 
tles had been one of the first inno- 
vations Storymaker had pushed 
through. Bloodshed from tavern

GALAXY 



brawls was cut to a third by this 
simple measure alone. Take away a 
man’s arms and not only is he less 
effective as a fighter but also is he 
less inclined to fight. The King was 
quick to appreciate that psychology 
and approved the control of garrison 
arms, even over the loud protests 
of his knights and lesser nobles. As 
a compromise, however, the senior 
officers and nobility were permitted 
to keep their hand weapons. 

Still, it might be necessary to dis- 
tribute weapons on short notice — in 
the event of a sneak attack at 
night— so one could not stow pikes 
and staves anyplace too inaccessi- 
ble. Where iron and stone cannot 
serve, one must substitute human 
flesh. It at least carried a brain to 
respond rapidly to the cry of alarm. 

Storymaker and his friends bade 
the pike keeper good day and con- 
tinued their rambling survey. 

Several men came lumbering 
past, red faced and wheezing. They 
were earning their evening grog as 
Storymaker had laid down, five laps 
around the compound for each 
bowl. It was the only way the mer- 
cenaries could think of to keep gar- 
risoned troops in fighting trim, and 
made work for yet more cripples as 
lap counters. 

It was interesting to note that the 
consumption of ale was no lower 
than before; but the jogging path 
had worn down by the span of a 
man’s hand. A soldier would walk 
barefoot through hell for the chance 
to get drunk, it seemed. 



Tomson nudged Storymaker and 
pointed to a portly figure who just 
lurched into view far back along the 
path. He wore a heavy fur coat de- 
spite the sweat streaming from his 
body. Running was hard enough for 
a man of his girth, yet he would not 
part with his prized coat even for 
the time it took him to earn a thirst 
quencher. Storymaker shared a grin 
with the boy. 

All of the troops had booty of 
one sort or another — it was one of 
the few incentives to soldiering that 
had any long term appeal. Indeed, 
the practice of letting the fighting 
men keep much of their loot had 
been around long before the mer- 
cenaries took command. 

The problem was, though, that 
once a castle’s walls were breached 
and the doors flung open, the at- 
tacking army would dissolve into an 
orgy of rape and pillage that was 
beyond control. Often, much wealth 
was simply destroyed, fine tapes- 
tries carved up for blankets and del- 
icate jewelry mangled for its gold. 

There were even occasions re- 
corded when the ousted lord kept 
about himself a sufficient body of 
disciplined troops to retake his hold- 
ings from the drunken revelers be- 
fore the night was out. 

Storymaker 1 changed all that. 
Whenever they made their final as- 
sault on one of the Ducal strong- 
holds, he kept back a small force 
of his most trustworthy (i.e. sober) 
men. Their job was to secure enemy 
royalty and their possessions while 



STORYMAKER 



147 



the fighting was still underway, and 
to keep his own rabble army in line 
until gates and guardposts could be 
manned. 

Only then did Storymaker allow 
the rape and pillage to begin. Such 
enlightened leadership made him the 
most feared and respected fighter 
these people had ever known. 

These people? wondered 
Storymaker. Who then are my 
people? 

He was distracted from this train 
of thought when Tomson suddenly 
darted into a doorway. They had 
reached the barracks rooms in their 
wanderings; all about them were 
men dozing in the watery sunshine 
or gaming in small clusters. Noth- 
ing seemed out of the ordinary. 

A stone jug came flying through 
the doorway. It hit the hardpacked 
courtyard and shattered, spraying 
shards and the strong odor of dis- 
tilled liquor in all directions. A roar 
of anger rose up from several 
throats inside. 

Tomson came backing out, hand 
on his knife, followed by three 
beet-faced soldiers with blood in 
their eyes. 

“You know the rules,” the boy 
said with remarkable steadiness. 
“Only beer while in garrison. 
Where did you get that stuff? Who 
sold it to you?” 

Hard liquor was one of the com- 
monest bribes doled out by the 
Dukes’ spies. Its very presence 
within the walls told of some piece 
of intelligence revealed, perhaps 



some traitorous service purchased. 
Treachery indeed. 

The men were obviously too 
drunk to be cowed by any show of 
authority. They could not see 
beyond the loss of their precious 
jug. And now a crowd was form- 
ing, to wait and see how their offi- 
cers dealt with this clear breach of 
discipline. It was not a very friendly 
crowd. 

Malreve and Storymaker came up 
on either side of the boy. 

“I can handle them, Sire,” he 
said. “My blade evens the score 
nicely.” There was no braggadocio 
in that pronouncement; it was 
merely a careful analysis of the tac- 
tical situation. 

“True enough, lad,” said 
Storymaker, clearly proud of the 
younger man’s poise. “But ’twere 
better we ended this fast and with a 
minimum of bloodshed. There’s no 
shame in having help for that.” 

They waded in with bare fists. 

It was over quickly enough. 
Storymaker ducked a clumsy 
haymaker, shoved his opponent off 
balance, then felled him with a stiff- 
handed chop to the base of the 
neck. When he looked up, the other 
two drunks also lay in the dirt. Mal- 
reve grinned his delight. 

Storymaker met Tomson’s smile, 
gave him a significant nod. It was 
he whose keen eyesight had caught 
these malefactors; let him issue the 
orders for their punishment. It 
would raise his stature in the eyes 
of the troops.

GALAXY 



While Tomson mobilized the 
waiting crowd to carry out his 
directives — the soldiers were sud- 
denly much more obedient — 
Storymaker watched a page make 
his way across the courtyard toward 
them. Barely more than a child, he 
was one of the King’s messengers. 

“Begging your pardon. Sire,” 
the boy stammered, “but His 
Majesty w-wishes your presence, 
Sire. And, uh,” he screwed up his 
face in concentration, “and would 
you please bring your staff. Sire.” 
He sighed audibly; he must have 
gotten everything right despite the 
terror of facing the great 
Storymaker himself. 

“Very well.” He suppressed a 
grin. 

“Please inform His Majesty that 
we are on our way.” The page 
bowed and fled. 

Storymaker rounded up his two 
friends and explained. They made 
their way quickly towards the 
King’s quarters; it was never wise 
to keep royalty waiting. Besides, an 
audience with the King might well 
be the start of a new campaign. 
Everyone would be pleased by such 
news. 

As they entered the audience 
chamber, Tomson said to 
Storymaker, “By the way, you 
must teach me your trick of hitting 
with the stiffened hand, Sire. It 
looked very effective.” 

The mercenary felt another lurch 
of strangeness. He hadn’t realized 
that he knew such tricks. 



* * ★ 

The King looked old. 

Years of warfare had taken their 
toll, as they must of any sensitive 
man. Peace had reigned in his 
father’s time, giving the young 
Prince a chance to improve the lot of 
his nation through land reforms and 
extensive irrigation. Such work in- 
centives and technological aid led to 
incredible prosperity, and roused the 
envy of his cousins. 

When the old King died each of 
his neighboring relatives tried in 
turn to bite off a piece of the pros- 
perous domain before the young 
ruler could get his wits about him. 
Slowly they learned that a lover of 
peace was not necessarily a coward 
on the battlefield. Shifting alliances 
formed in the wake of each repulse, 
to try anew at conquering the gentle 
monarch who was a not so gentle 
fighter. 

The coming of Storymaker and 
Malreve almost ended their threat. 
Defeat after defeat, however, only 
served to frighten all the Dukes into 
suspending their internecine squab- 
bles and rising up in strength 
against Keep Ahnlich and its ruler. 
Thus the current uneasy stalemate 
and the King’s grey hair. 

The mercenaries and Tomson 
bowed deeply. 

“It’s been too long since I’ve had 
you at my table, Storymaker,” the 
monarch began. “I miss hearing 



STORYMAKER 



149 



your delightful fabrications.” 

Storymaker could only bow 
deeply again at this flattery. 

‘‘But I fear there’s no time to 
make amends for all those missed 
evenings.” He paused. ‘‘You two 
are discharged from my service as 
of today.” 

“Sire!” He could’t keep the hurt 
astonishment from exploding. “If 
there is any way we’ve failed to 
serve you ...” 

“No, no. Be still.” He was a bit 
testy. “I must tell you — the north- 
ern frontier fell this morning. There 
was no battle; it was mass deser- 
tion. My messengers tell me that 
the Dukes are marching two 
thousand strong. They will be here 
by tonight, with as many more ar- 
riving before the week is out. 
Ahnlich must eventually fall.” 

There was stunned silence. 

“I tell you this so that you may 
escape in time. You cannot help me 
anymore, and I would not have you 
die the death my cousins would ar- 
range for you. I myself will be steal- 
ing away within the hour.” 

“Can we not go with you? You 
will need men to guard your person. 
You will need officers to organize 
an army for your return to power.” 
The King smiled sadly. 

“Perhaps. But I fear that may be 
a while off, and I’ve already kept 
you idle too long. You mercenaries 
are never happy unless you’ve a 
good fight on your hands, eh?” The 
smile was warmer. 

“No, ’tis better we part now. 



Travelling in small groups will in- 
crease our chances of going unde- 
tected.” There was no arguing with 
that tone of finality. 

“You have both served me well. 
There will be an extra sack of gold 
coins waiting with your baggage to 
help smooth your way. For the plea- 
sure you have given me with your 
company, however, there is no re- 
ward I can conceive of that is 
adequate. If you have a wish, it 
would please me to grant it.” 

Storymaker barely hesitated. 

“May we take Tomson with us, 
Your Highness?” Being base born, 
the lad was property of the King. 
Malreve growled softly. 

“Of course, of course,” the King 
replied heartily. “I had forgotten 
your friendship in the midst of my 
own worries. Tomson, I discharge 
you from my service. You are a 
free man. I only pray you can run 
fast enough to enjoy your free- 
dom.” 

Both Tomson and Storymaker 
bowed low this time. 

“And now I must take my leave 
of you. Should fortune grant us a 
reunion there would be none glad- 
der than I; but I do not see it in the 
cards. Fare you well.” 

“And you, Sire,” each spoke 
softly. 

The King turned to leave, then 
stopped. 

“Oh, one last thing,” he turned 
to look at Storymaker. “It is easy 
enough to see how you came by 
your name, except for one thing.

Why do they call you Story maker 
instead of Story teller?” 

“I know not. Sire,” he replied 
simply. But for some reason the 
question shocked him to the core. 

I

‘‘Let’s get the hell out of here.” 

Malreve strode off rapidly 
through the warren of passageways 
even as he muttered those words. 

“Wait!” said Storymaker. “Our 
rooms are off that way. We must 
collect our baggage.” 

Malreve wheeled on him. 

“Didn’t you hear what the King 
said? There’ll be two thousand men 
here by tonight. Think what that 
means! The horsemen won’t wait on 
marching men; they’ll be here any 
moment!” 

“You’re right, of course.” Then, 
turning to Tomson, “I’m afraid 
you’re going to have to start your 
career as a free man without a pen- 
ny. But don’t worry; we’ve been 
broke before.” 

The boy smiled with complete 
trust. 

“He stays,” said Malreve. 

“What do you mean? You heard 
the King give him permission to 
come with us. What else does he 
need?’ ’ 

Malreve started off, stopped, ran 
his hand through his hair. He gave 
his friend that piercing glance 
again. 

“We have to leave ” he said in- 
tensely. “Don’t you understand?” 



Storymaker tried to suppress un- 
derstanding, and he almost suc- 
ceeded. 

“Can’t he come along part of the 
way, at least?” he asked meekly. 
Meekly. Tomson looked from one 
to the other in confusion. 

Malreve swore. Shrugged. 

“Let’s move.” 

They had almost retraced their 
route when the disturbance began. 
Men were running in all directions. 
Malreve grunted and broke into a 
trot. 

The pike keeper was impaled on 
one of his own weapons and the en- 
tire rack was aflame. There was no 
hope of arming the garrison. Some 
well-placed traitor had seen to that. 

Someone else was swinging the 
gates wide even as they reached 
them. So much for the thought of 
sneaking out. They ran past the 
turncoat and headed across the fro- 
zen marsh for the hills. Horsemen 
could already be seen approaching 
the betrayed fortress. A shout and a 
wave from the guardpost alerted the 
attackers to the running men. A doz- 
en horses detached themselves 
from the pack and altered course to 
cut off their flight. 

The three men ran across the un- 
even ground as fast as they dared. 
The shrubbery on the hillside came 
closer, but so did the shouts of the 
riders. It would be a near thing. 

Malreve dove into the first large 
thicket they came to and, surprising- 
ly, disappeared below ground level. 
A stuttering roar came from beneath 



STORYMAKER

the camouflage. Within seconds, he 
emerged driving a jeep up the steep 
incline. 

Storymaker leaped aboard before 
his companion could utter his usual 
impatient growj, but Tomson froze 
at the sight of the machine. 

“Come on,” Storymaker urged. 
“It won’t hurt you.” He half drag- 
ged the boy into a seat. 

They started with a lurch and al- 
most lost Tomson immediately. 
Storymaker had to show him where 
to hold on, how to take the shocks 
of the uneven terrain. The horsemen 
grew closer. 

Malreve drove like a maniac. 
Over smooth ground he gained eas- 
ily over their pursuers. But there 
were many rocks and ruts where 
horses could leap while a wheeled 
vehicle could not. Faster and faster 
Malreve took the rough spots. The 
jeep bounced wildly. 

But horses tire. At first it seemed 
that that simple fact would deter- 
mine who won the race up the hill- 
side; already there were stragglers 
among the pursuit. Then a ridge of 
rock appeared over the next crest. 

The pursuing horsemen saw the 
barrier almost at the same time and 
cheered. 

Tomson was looking green. 
Storymaker diverted his attention 
from the trouble ahead long enough 
to give the boy a reassuring smile. 

“It’s all right. Lad. We’ll make 
it yet.” 

“Sire! I . .” Whatever Tomson 
intended to say was wrenched from 

152 



him as they crested the ridge at full 
speed. 

The engine roared as the wheels 
lost traction and the jeep slowly be- 
gan to tumble in midair. Storymaker 
saw that they were going to land 
upside down. He punched Mal- 
reve’s shoulder as a signal to jump, 
turned to find Tomson already 
thrown free. He tensed to leap and 
found his foot caught beneath the 
seat. The ground loomed up. 

He landed in green cotton, with 
olive-drab confetti showering down 
on his head and shoulders. The cot- 
ton became close cropped grass; the 
jeep/confetti dissipated as it touched 
the ground. Nearby he saw Malreve 
get to his feet and tum toward him. 
Tomson was gone. 

There was silence, then thunder- 
ous applause. 

* * * 

All around them on the hillside 
people stood, appearing as if from a 
rapidly thinning fog. They were 
clad in garmets of simple cut — as 
were he and Malreve, Storymaker 
suddenly noticed. It was coming 
back to him now, slowly as ever. 

This was the time of the Festival. 
The Games were over, the new 
Songs had been sung. Now was the 
time for the Stories, and he and 
Malreve had just finished a joint 
composition. 

All around him he heard the tele- 
pathic chatter of people discussing 
the dream. Squalor and violence 



GALAXY 




were always popular themes in 
these tame times. The judges would, 
of course, look beyond such base 
appeals and evaluate the work on 
the basis of technique and style. 

"Such an unusual withdrawal 
sequence,” came a hard-edged in- 
tellectual thought. “Did you notice 
how gradually the sense of aliena- 
tion was built? I haven’t seen such 
a smooth transition since The 
Troubador retired.” 

“Yes. And the jeep was such a 
marvelous anachronism, don’t you 
think?” This from an effete-looking 
girl up the slope a ways. 

“But what do you make of Tom- 
son?” her companion (no, her 
lover) replied. “Shouldn’t he prop- 
erly have been left behind?” the 
second girl pursued. 

“Oh, you’re so insensitive,” the 



first girl shot back. “Don’t you 
understand anything?” 

Storymaker felt numb. He looked 
down at his thin arms; his sunken 
chest, feeling reality seep in around 
him. Dreamers were bred for their 
heightened telepathic abilities, not 
for physical attractiveness. A boy 
his age was discussing with his 
girlfriend Storymaker’s well known 
preoccupation with sex. It made 
him feel even lonelier. 

He looked over at Malreve, who 
was now perceivable as a pudgy 
boy of about the same age. Mal- 
reve ’s customary pout was back and 
he kicked diffidently at the turf to 
cover his embarrassment. It had 
been a good dream; both hated this 
period of dissection that always fol- 
lowed. 

Still, it was their life, 



STORYMAKER 



153 



their . everything. During the 
concluding days of each Festival 
they reigned supreme. Few could 
build and guide a communal fantasy 
half as well as they. Malreve’s fame 
was widespread and he, Story- 
maker, was bidding fair for immor- 
tality. He was the Maker of Stories, 
a title to be proud of. 

Loneliness was the price exacted 
of all good Dreamers. The desire 
for the normal pleasures of life that 
they were denied led to these superb- 
ly controlled flights of the imagi- 
nation; fantasies which were larger 
than life simply because they had 
never learned life’s true dimensions. 

The results were in; the scores 
were high. Storymaker conferred 



briefly with Malreve, reached 
agreement. Around them the last of 
the chatter died away in the hush 
that always precedes a Story. 

The new fantasy was building be- 
tween them, seemingly without voli- 
tion, almost beyond their ability to 
control it. As he slid downward into 
a new oblivion, Storymaker’s mind 
gave a rebellious cry. 

Tomson! Where are you? 

The greedy voyeurs were enjoy- 
ing even this, his moment of private 
sadness. Just before he left reality 
behind once more, Storymaker had 
time for one last heart-rending 
thought: 

Tomson was the best friend he’d 
ever had. ★

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Perhaps you have heard from him already, 
but I sent a copy of the letter of Dr. Pour- 
nelle’s published on page 4 of the September 
issue to my congressman, the Honorable Paul 
Findley. I thought you might like to see a 
copy of the letter I received from Con- 
gressman Findley (attached). Why don’t you 
make a regular or irregular feature, running 
the best and most feasible ideas and sugges- 
tions in way of problem-solving on the order 
of Dr. Poumelle’s idea? You could keep 
them similarly brief, of course, so that not 
too much editorial space is given over to 
something that is not strictly within the con- 
fines of the magazine's format. It would be 
an excellent public service and really might 
come to something. 

I hope that others who sent in copies of 
the letter received the same encouraging re- 
sponse as I did. 

Yours sincerely, 
Nick Howes 

1 256 State 
Alton, IL 62002 

Congressman Findley’ s reply; 

Dear Mr. Howes: 

What an original idea. I am delighted that 
you have taken the time lo excerpt the article 
from Galaxy Magazine and send it to me. 
Although I have long opposed government 
subsidies for various U.S. commodities, I 
fully intend to pursue this with officials at 



the U.S. Department of Agriculture to see 
what problems may exist. 1 am immediately 
securing the original of the article from 
Galaxy and will ask USDA to prepare an 
analysis of it for me. Thanks very much for 
bringing it to my attention. 

Warm regards, 
Paul Findley 
Representative in Congress 

If anything comes of this the readers of 
Galaxy will be among the first to know. As 
for a regular or irregular column-it's called 
‘ ‘Directions. 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Dr. Poumelle’s UFO article (August 
Galaxy) leads me to speculate on a possible 
"mechanism” for their propulsion, one 
which might also explain some of their odd 
side effects. 

Magnetic monopoles. 

For every elementary interaction there is a 
dimensionless number which measures its 
strength, and determines both the importance 
and the complexity of its manifestation in the 
behavior of particles. For electrons the 
number is known as the fine structure con- 
stant; it is e 2 /fic, where e is the charge of the 
electron, c is the speed of light, and h is 
Planck's constant divided by 2 pi. This 
number is 1/137, which is comfortably less 
than one. As a result the theory of quantum 
electrodynamics works well. 

For the "strong" interaction (which holds 
nuclei together) the analogous constant is 
about 10, and the result is that we get just 
nowhere trying to use the same approxima- 
tion methods on strong interaclions that were 
successful in electrodynamics. The theory of 
string interactions has a history of unending, 
increasingly desperate search for some other 
way to get simple, reliable predictions from 
fundamental ideas. The large value of that 
constant also implies a huge number of un- 
stable “particles” held together by the strong 
interaction. 

Newspaper accounts of the " monopole 
discovery” state that the charge on the 
monopole is !37e. Because the fine structure 



DIRECTIONS 



155 



constant is determined by e squared, for 
monopoles one gets a “fine structure con- 
stant” of 137. Quantum magnetodynamics, 
or whatever it is to be called, will deal with 
much the strongest interaction known. There- 
fore it is just impossible to predict the 
technology that could be built out of 
monopoles. The effect on science fiction 
should be exhilarating: from now on and for 
a long time, the word “monopole” can ex- 
cuse just about anything a writer wants it to 
in the way of unreasonable machinery. 

The theorists are going to go frantic. It 
will be fun to watch. 

Sincerely yours, 
Christopher J. Henrich 
2387 Morris Avenue D4 
Bronx, N Y. 10468. 

A short pause while we bring Galaxy’s 
Science Editor on-line: 

Dear Jim, 

Checking around with people who ought 
to know, I find the consensus is that Henrich 
is right: given the binding energies available 
in monopole interactions, there may be a 
whole new class of elements we’ve not yet 
seen, and they may have some weird 
properties — providing we could ever get hold 
of any. 

Also, if we can manipulate monopoles so 
they can be flung at various nuclei, the re- 
sults could be pretty spectacular. It could 
even be an approach to sucking far more 
energy out of interactions than we’ve previ- 
ously hoped for. 

As to whether these things could provide 
propulsive power for interstellar ships, no- 
body wants to say. 

We can all agree that if the evidence holds 
up and monopoles do exist, it’s going to be a 
lot of fun to watch.

Dear Jim, „ 

GALAXY readers may be interested to know 
that there is now a "space lobby” which 
they can join. It is headed by Werner von 
Braun, and has an impressive board of direc- 

156 




tors. My own solicitation to join was sent by 
Dr. Robert Forward, who seems to appear 
regularly in my columns as well as in his 
own articles. 

The National Space Institute is an educa- 
tional non-profit organization with member- 
ship costs deductible from taxes. It will have 
what appear to be interesting publications, 
and will also try to educate the public to the 
value of space research. 

For those interested, dues are $15.00 a 
year ($9.00 for students below the age of 18) 
and membership is open to the general pub- 
lic. The address is National Space Institute, 
Box 23527 L’Enfant Plaza, Washington DC 
20024. I’ve already sent in my dues. Anyone 
care to join me? 

Best, 

Jerry Poumelle 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Please allow me this short word concerning 
Don Tarbet’s letter in the September issue of 
Galaxy. 

How could anyone imagine that science- 

GALAXY 





fiction is unoriginal or, “no longer present- 
ing anything radically new and different”? 
Science fiction as a maturing media has pro- 
duced the most vigorously asserting creative 
masterpieces for an entire decade. Bear wit- 
ness: Harlan Ellison, Frank Herbert, Roger 
Zelazny, Norman Spinrad and Ursula K. Le 
Guin. There has been nothing in the so-call- 
ed "mainstream” that even compares in 
depth and originality with science fiction. (I 
read S.F. ’cause that's what’s Happening). 

But I am not at odds with Mr. Tarbet for 
these primarily emotional reasons. Not only is 
there flaw in his intellectual argument, but 
his position defies the very intention of intel- 
lectual argument. To wit, Mr. Tarbet pro- 
poses a throw-back to Ye Olde Sci-Fie days. 
That sir is a regression, (no offence intended 
to Ye Olde Masters)! His logic tells him that 
them wuz the good of days when two fisted 
men thunk through their problems to the end. 
Yet he fails to recognize that in spite of the 
optimistic energies of those by-gone decades 
we are still where we are. Which brings me 
to the point. The first step in surmounting a 
problem lies in its acceptance as a problem, 
rather than it's recognition. 

Now Mr. Tarbet shuns acceptance and rec- 
ognition both in one fell swoop, and pro- 
poses a return to the times when science- 
fiction was nothing but two bit ESCAPIST 
literature. All I can say is that there is plenty 
of that stuff on the fringes. He attacks that 
which is radical to him, but doesn’t seem to 
realize that radical was what he was calling 
for. 

One last dig for Mr. Tarbet; Where is your 
sense of wonder, sir? 

Sincerely, 
Bud Houston

Mr. Baen, 

First of all, it was very nice of you to in- 
vite letters. We rarely get invited to the 
really interesting places. Secondly, Dr. Pour- 
nelle’s depiction of our big-league scientists- 
kicking the philosophical ball around on the 
home court was very encouraging to me. 



Ever since the Second Awareness, I’ve felt 
the premonitory tremblings of our “founda- 
tionless future”, and am gratified that it is 
not just a local phenomenon. Naturally, I do 
not feel it is proper for the dictionary of sci- 
ence to contain the word “believe”, prefer- 
ring a strict neutrality be kept with regard to 
unproven theory, but the open mind is al- 
ways desirable. When 1 was in my first 
physics class many years ago, I heard the in- 
structor state very firmly, “The nature of 
matter is that it cannot be created or de- 
stroyed, but merely changed in form.” 1 
look this on good faith, as is expected of a 
student, thereby nullifying any contradictory 
concepts I may have formed then. I feel that 
instructor should have added as footnote, 
“By present technology.” Perhaps he consi- 
dered it obvious, perhaps not. At any rate, 
all scientific texts should end on a similar 
note, so as to make aware to impressionable 
young students that fact does not always re- 
main fact so long as inquiry persists. It took 
me several years to realize that the matter he 
was referring to as being non-creatable was 
an actuality, therefore created (by what 
means or materials available in non- 
existence, time must tell), and creatable, 
even if not by present technology. Who 
knows how much of our established science 
has been built on unsound theory, and is be- 
ing built upon further every day? The Law of 
Existence states, “You can get something for 
nothing, despite claims to the contrary.” 
How many perfectly usable bridges have had 
“Washed Out” signs erected on them during 
the adolescence of science? And does anyone 
remember where they are, atrophying in the 
back of the mind? A theory can be elevated 
to the status of indisputable truth by people 
who call it a “belief’ rather than being will- 
ing to say, “I don’t know” and continue the 
search unbiased. Belief is not knowledge, 
nor is it objectivity. It is an invalid condi- 
tion; a prejudice. It is the most futile state of 
the mind, for nothing can be done with it. If 
it were provable, it would be fact; if it were 
disprovable, it would be set aside. But held 
in the mind in such a state, a theory distorts 
itself; it draws incomplete information from 



DIRECTIONS

the world to support itself. I will accept the 
fact of extraterrestrial spaceships when the 
operators are interviewed in Galaxy, and will 
dismiss it when our exploratory craft have 
searched this- bubble of motion (time) 
phenomenon and declared it empty of said 
spaceships. 

Yoiys in observant neutrality,

Does existence presuppose creation ? I prefer 
to think that there has always been. .some- 
thing. 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I’m afraid I must differ with Mr. Stur- 
geon’s high opinion of Samuel R. Delany’s 
latest novel, Dhalgren. His arguments can’t 
be faulted — Delany's ideas are presented as 
usual in a beautifully ingenious form. How- 
ever, his praise seems to overlook one of 
the most vital elements in any novel, an 
element that is, sadly, lacking from 
Dhalgren — the ability of the work to hold 
the reader’s interest while the major ideas are 
being presented. 

It is tragic that this novel has failed to 
hold any sort of interest mechanically for the 
reader, for, as Sturgeon has pointed out, the 
ideas are important, to say the least. The 
problem lies in the fact that you can’t write 
896 pages in “chords”, as Sturgeon aptly 
calls them, without boring your reader com- 
pletely to death. 

Continuing the chord analogy, consider 
this: the novel opens, and Delany strikes his 
first note. Fine. He can set up his mood and 
tone, build up his characters. But what hap- 
pens next? Following his unified diction- 
plot-thematic-character style (which he has 
put forth in his essay, “About 5175 
Words”), the second note of the “chord” 
fails to delineate the plot further, but rather 
simply goes over the same ground again and 
again, each time thickening the plot. 

Delany uses this technique with all of his 
work to some extent. One of the most pro- 
nounced examples was in his novella, “The 
Star Pit.” Structurally, this story was one of 



his finest. But mechanically, it was almost 
insufferable. Delany’s work rests on a pre- 
carious balance between his brilliant thematic 
development and an extremely weak mode of 
presentation for those themes. In some cases, 
the end — the themes and structure — justify 
the means, as in the case of “The Star Pit.” 
In other cases, the themes and structure, no 
matter how brilliant, cannot justify the tedi- 
ous development that is necessary to tie to- 
gether all the varied pieces of Delany's intri- 
cate themes. It is a great loss that Dhalgren 
belongs to this second class. Although its 
themes are brilliant, the novel simply cannot 
hold the reader’s attention or interest. This 
renders the work almost useless.

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Heartiest congratulations on getting Spider 
Robinson for the book reviews. An essay 
masquerading as a review is as much use as 
tits on a boar hog; Robinson seems 
businesslike and when 1 have read his col- 
umn I know something about what to buy, 
not something about the Robinsonian ego, in 
which I am not interested.

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I found your August editorial, "The Myth 
of the Light Barrier,” enlightening. A scien- 
tific discussion of forseeable possibilities for 
circumventing light velocity is found in Adri- 
an Berry’s THE NEXT TEN THOUSAND 
YEARS, pp. 91-105. The idea of tachyons 
(1962) occurred from a simple insight: that 
Relativity (1905) does not forbid particles 
that always travel hyper-optically. In those 
57 years no physicist saw this! 

Arthur C. Clarke hit the nail on the head 
with his insight: "When an elderly and dis- 
tinguished scientist tells you that something 
is impossible, he is almost certainly wrong.

The experts can spot all the difficulties, but 
lack the imagination and vision to see how 
they can be overcome. The layman’s ignor- 
ant optimism turns out, in the long run — and 
often in the short run! — to be nearer the 
truth.” 

Also re your editorial, you can disprove 
Special Relativity for only a few cents. Two 
silicon photo-electric cells are placed 30 cm 
apart, on opposite sides of a small light bulb. 
They" are wired to one another and to a micro- 
ammeter in such a way that only the dif- 
ference in current between the cells flows 
through the microammeter. Bringing one cell 
a fraction of a millimeter closer to the light 
is sufficient to cause a variation of several 
microamps. The apparatus is put in a 
cardboard tube revolving on an axis; there is 
a decrease in intensity corresponding roughly 
to a propagation of light to the south of the 
Solar System. The absolute velocity of the 
Solor System is now an experimental fact.

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I’ve been reading Galaxy for several 
months now and I am becoming fonder of 
your magazine with each issue. 

Spider Robinson is a pleasant change; Mr. 
Robinson’s breezy style makes the one col- 
umn that is often so-so (no matter what 
magazine you’re reading) interesting and 
enjoyable — whether you agree with him or 
not! I hope he lasts a long time. 

Speaking of things lasting a while I can’t 
tell you how much I agree with Mr. Geis in 
this month’s [August. Ed.] “Alien View- 
point.” He said all the things 1 have wanted 
to say, but never could. If Richard Geis ever 
stops listening to Alter — chain him to a 



wall!!!
