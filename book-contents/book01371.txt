T hose who like to think of 
themselves as serious students 
of literature are deeply con- 
cerned with the purpose of fiction. 
Of course, they immediately re- 
ject its obvious purpose of enter- 
tainment as unworthy of their ap- 
proval. Any story which seems 
limited in value to mere pleasure is 
called ''escape literature" and 
held in considerable contempt. 
Generally, science fiction has 
been treated as belonging to that 
unworthy category. 

Now, however, they may have to 
change their attitude about this. If 
a book which has been on the non- 
fiction best-seller list for many 



weeks is correct, science fiction 
may be the one form of literature 
which has the greatest and most 
necessary value to its readers. 

Future Shock, by Alvin Toffler 
(Random House), has nothing di- 
rectly to do with science fiction. 
It discusses the future, but in as 
factual a manner as possible. 
The book is deeply concerned 
with our present and our seem- 
ing inability to deal with it. 

According to Tofller's theory 
most of the ills of our present stem 
from the fact that people cannot 
adjust to the rapid changes going

It would be named the Not For 
Hire, No one would ever be able to 
take it away from him, it would be 
so strongly armored and weapon- 
ed. Nor would anyone be able to 
buy or rent it from him. It would be 
Not For Hire, 

The name glowed in great black 
letters against the white hull. NOT 
FOR HIRE, 

The fabulous Riverboat would 
have four decks, the boiler deck, 
the main deck, the hurricane deck 
and the landing deck for the aer- 
ial machine. Its overall length 
would be four hundred and forty 
feet and six inches. The beam over 
the paddle-wheel guards would be 
ninety-three feet. Mean draft, 
loaded, twelve feet. The hull would 
be made of magnalium or, per- 
haps, plastic. The great stacks 
would spout smoke now and then, 
because there was a steam boiler 
aboard. But this was only to pro- 
pel the big plastic bullets for the 
steam machine guns. The giant 
paddlewheels on the sides of the 
Riverboat would be turned by 
enormous electrical motors. 

The Not For Hire would be the 
only metal boat on The River, the 
only boat not propelled by oars or 
wind, and it would make anybody 
sit up and stare, whether he was 
born in 2,000,000 B.C. or in 2000 
A.D. 

And he, Sam Clemens, would be 
The Captain, Capital T, capital 
C, because, aboard this vessel. 



carrying a crew of one hundred 
and twenty, there would be only 
one Captain. 

King John of England could call 
himself Admiral if he wished, 
though if Sam Clemens had any- 
thing to do with it, he’d be First 
Mate, not Admiral. And if Sam 
Clemens really had anything to 
do with it King John — John Lack- 
land, Rotten John, Dirty John, 
Lecher John, Pigsty John — would 
not even be allowed on the boat. 
Sam Clemens, smoking a big 
green cigar, wearing a white cap, 
dressed in a white kilt with a white 
towel over his shoulders for a 
cape, would lean out of the star- 
board port of the great pilothouse 
and yell, Avast there, you lubbers! 
Grab hold of that putrescent mass 
of immorality and treachery 
and toss him off the gangplank, I 
don't care if he lands in The River 
or on the bank! Get rid of that hu- 
man garbage! 

Over the railing of the boiler 
deck Prince John would sail. Sly- 
boots John, screaming, cursing in 
his French-accented Middle Eng- 
lish or in Anglo-Norman French 
or in Esperanto. Then the gang- 
plank would be drawn up, bells 
would ring, whistles would blow 
and Sam Clemens, standing be- 
hind the pilot, would give the or- 
der to begin the voyage. 

The voyage! Up a River for 
maybe ten million miles, or may- 
be twenty million miles, for may- 

IF 



6 




be forty years or a hundred years. 
Such a Riverboat, such a River, 
such a voyage had never been 
dreamed of on Earth, long dead 
Earth! Up The River, the only one 
on this world, on the only boat like 
this, with Sam Clemens as La 
§ipestro , The Captain, and also 
addressed as La Estro, The Boss. 

He was so happy! 

And then, as they headed out to- 
ward the middle of The River, just 
to test the current, which was 
strongest in the center of the 
mighty stream, as the thousands 
along the bank waved and cheered 
or wept after the boat, after him, 
Samuel Langhorne Clemens, alias 
Mark Twain— The Captain, The 
Boss — he saw a man with long yel- 
low hair and broad shoulders push- 
ing through the crowd. 

T he man wore a towel-like 
cloth, secured by magnetic tabs 
under the material, as a kilt. His 
leather sandals were made of the 
hide of the whale-sized riverdragon 
fish. Around his thickly muscled 
neck he wore a string of brilliantly 
colored hornfish vertebrae. In his 
huge powerful hand he gripped 
the wooden shaft of a large war- 
axe of iron. His pale blue eyes were 
fixed on Samuel Clemens and that 
broad hawk-nosed face was grim. 

Sam Clemens screamed to the 
pilot. Faster! Faster! Full speed 
ahead! 

The great paddlewheels began 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAt 



to dig into the water more swift- 
ly — Chunk-chunk. Even through 
the fiberglas-insulated deck, the 
vibrations made the deck quiver. 
Suddenly the blond man, Erik 
Bloodaxe, tenth-century Viking 
King, was in the pilothouse. 

He shouted at Sam Clemens in 
Old Norse, Traitor! Droppings of 
Ratatosk! I told you / would wait 
along the banks of The River! You 
betrayed me so you could get the 
iron from the fallen star and build 
your great Riverboat! 

Sam fled the pilothouse and 
down the ladders from deck to deck 
and down into the dark bowels of 
the hold, but Erik Bloodaxe was al- 
ways two steps behind. 

Past the colossal rotating electric 
motors Sam Clemens ran and then 
he was in the chemistry room, 
where the engineers were making 
potassium nitrate from human 
excrement and mixing it with 
sulfur and charcoal to make gun- 
powder. Sam grabbed hold of a 
lighter and a resin torch, pressed 
the slide and a white-hot glowing 
wire slid out of the case. 

Stop, or Til blow up the whole 
boat! Sam screamed. 

Erik had stopped, but he was 
swinging the big axe around and 
around over his head. He grinned 
and said. Go ahead! You haven t 
got the guts! You love the River- 
boat more than you love anything, 
even your faithless but precious 
Livy! You wouldnt blow her up! 

7 




So rm going to split you down the 
middle with my axe and then take 
the Riverboat for myself! 

No! No! Sam screamed. You 
wouldnt dare! You cant! You 
cant! This is my dream, my love, 
my passion, my life, my world! 
You cant. 

The Norseman stepped closer to 
him; the axe whistled over his head. 

/ can't? Just stand there and see! 

Over his shoulder Sam saw a 
shadow. It moved forward and be- 
came a tall, faceless figure. It was 
X, the Mysterious Stranger, the 
renegade Ethical who had sent the 
meteorite crashing into the River- 
valley so that Sam could have iron 
and nickel to build his Riverboat 
on this mineral-poor planet. And 
so he could sail up The River to the 
North Polar Sea where the Misty 
Tower, the Big Grail, call it what 
you would, was hidden in the cold 
fog. And there Sam, with the 
eleven men chosen by X for his as 
yet unrevealed plan, would storm 
the Tower and find — find what? 

Stranger! Sam called. Save me! 
Save me! 

The laughter was like a wind 
from the polar sea, turning his en- 
trails to crystal. 

Save yourself, Sam! the 
Stranger said. 

No!' No! You promised! Sam 
yelled. And then his eyes were open 
and the last of his groans died 
away. Or had he dreamed that he 
was groaning?

H e sat up. His bed was made 
of bamboo. The mattress was a 
bamboo fiber cloth stuffed with 
giant leaves of the irontree. The 
blanket was made up of five towels 
secured together by magnetic 
tabs. The bed was against the wall 
of a room twenty feet square. It 
held a desk and a round table and 
about a dozen chairs, all of bam- 
boo or pine, and a fired-clay cham- 
ber pot. There were also a bamboo 
bucket half-full with water, a tall 
broad case with many pigeonholes 
for rolls of paper, a rack with 
bamboo and pine spears with flint 
and iron tips, yew bows and ar- 
rows, a waraxe of nickel-iron and 
four long steel knives. On the wall 
were a number of pegs from which 
white towels hung. On one hat- 
stand was a naval cap, an officer's, 
made of leather covered with a 
thin white cloth. 

On the table was his grail, a 
gray metallic cylinder with a me- 
tal handle. 

On the desk were glass bottles 
containing a soot-black ink, a 
number of bone pens and one 
nickel-iron pen. The papers on the 
desk were of bamboo, though 
there were a few sheets of vellum 
from the inner lining of the 
stomach of the hornfish. 

Glass windows (or ports, as he 
called them) looked out all 
around the room and, as far as 
Sam Clemens knew, this was the 
only house with glass windows in 

IF 




the entire Rivervalley. Certain- 
ly, it was the only one for 10,000 
miles either way from this area. 

The sole light came from the 
sky. Though it was not yet dawn, 
the light was a trifle brighter than 
that cast by the full moon on Earth. 
Giant stars of many colors, some 
so big they looked like chipped- 
off pieces of the moon, jampacked 
the heavens. Bright sheets and 
streamers hung between the stars, 
behind them, and even, seeming- 
ly, in front of some of the bright- 
est. These were cosmic gas clouds, 
the like of which had never been 
seen by the unaided eye on Earth. 
The stars and the clouds made a 
glory that never ceased to thrill the 
more sensitive of the humanity 
along The River, 

Sam Clemens, smacking his lips 
at the sour taste of the liquor he 
had drunk that evening and the 
even sourer taste of the dream, 
stumbled across the floor. He 
opened his eyes completely when 
he reached the desk, picked up a 
lighter and applied the extended 
hot wire to a stone bracket, where 
the smoke went out through an 
opening at the junction of ceiling 
and wall. 

He opened a port and looked out 
toward The River. A year ago he 
would have seen only a flat plain 
about a mile and a half wide and 
covered with short, tough, bright- 
green grass. Now it was a hideous 
mass of piled-up earth, deep pits 



and many buildings of bamboo 
and pine containing brick furn- 
aces. These were his steel mills (so- 
called), his glass factory, his 
smelters, his cement mills, his 
forges, his blacksmith shops, his 
armories, his laboratories and 
his nitric- and sulfuric-acid fac- 
tories. A half a mile away was a 
high wall of pine logs enclosing 
the first metal boat he would build. 

Torches flared to his left. Even 
at night the men were digging out 
the siderite chunks, hauling up 
pieces of the nickel-iron. 

Behind him had been a forest of 
thousand-foot irontrees, red pine, 
lodgepole pine, black oak, white 
oak, yew trees and thick stands of 
bamboo. These had stood on the 
foothills; the hills were mostly 
still there but the trees, except for 
the irontrees, were all gone, along 
with the bamboo. Only the huge 
irontrees had withstood the steel 
axes of Clemens' people. The tall 
grasses had been cut down and 
their fibers chemically treated to 
make ropes and paper, but their 
roots were so tough and so tangled, 
that there had not been enough rea- 
son to chop through them. The la- 
bor and the materials used in 
chopping through the roots of the 
short grass of the plains to get to 
the metal there had been very ex- 
pensive. Not in terms of money, 
because that did not exist, but in 
terms of sweat, worn-out stone and 
then dulled steel. 



THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



9 




Where this area had been beauti- 
ful with its many trees and bright 
grass and the colored blooms of 
the vines that covered the trees, it 
was now like a battlefield. It had 
been necessary to create ugliness 
to build the beautiful boat. 

W HOEVER had made this 
world had planned well. 
There was not much erosion, even 
though man had stripped the land 
of all the vegetation he could. The 
iron-trees, occupying twenty out of 
every one hundred square feet of 
the foothills, stood firm. Nor 
could the roots of any of the plants 
be killed; they were so deeply 
buried. 

Sam shivered at the wet and 
chilly wind which always came late 
at night from upRiver. He shivered 
also at the thought of the desola- 
tion. He loved beauty and nature's 
order and he loved the parklike ar- 
rangement of the valley, whatever 
else he thought about this world. 
Now he had made it hideous be- 
cause he had a dream. And he 
would have to extend that hideous- 
ness, because his mills and factor- 
ies needed more wood for fuel, for 
paper, for charcoal. All that his 
state had was used up ajid he had 
about used up all that Cernskujo 
to the immediate north and Pub- 
liujo to the immediate south, 
would trade him. If he wanted 
more he would have to war on his 
closest neighbors or make arrange- 



ments for trading with the more 
distant states or those just across 
The River. Or else conquer them 
and take their wood away from 
them. He did not want to do that; 
he abhorred war in principle and 
could barely stand it in practice. 

But if he was to have his River- 
boat he had to have wood as fuel 
for his factories. 

He also had to have bauxite and 
cryolite and platinum if he was to 
have aluminum generators and 
motors. 

The nearest source of all three 
was in Soul City, that nation 
twenty-six miles downRiver dom- 
inated by Elwood Hacking, who 
hates whites. 

So far, Sam had been able to 
trade iron weapons for bauxite, 
cryolite, cinnabar and platinum. 
Sam's own state, Parolando, need- 
ed the weapons badly. Adding one 
burden to the other. Hacking in- 
sisted that Parolando use its own 
men to mine and transport the ore. 

Sam sighed deeply. Why in hell 
hadn't the Mysterious Stranger 
directed ihe meteorite to fall right 
by the bauxite deposits? Then, 
when Sam and Bloodaxe's Vik- 
ings had sailed into this area im- 
mediately after the meteorite 
had struck, they could have 
claimed the land that was now Soul 
City for their own. When Hacking 
arrived, he would have been forced 
to join Clemens or to leave. 

Still, even with the Stranger's 

IF 



10 




powers, it could not be easy to de- 
flect a hundred-thousand-ton, 
iron-nickel siderite from its course 
and make it fall only twenty-six 
miles from the bauxite and other 
minerals. Actually the Stranger 
had supposed that he had hit the 
target on the bull’s-eye. He had 
told Sam, before he disappeared 
on some unknown mission, that 
the minerals were upRiver, all 
within a seven-mile range. But he 
had been mistaken. And that had 
made Sam both glad and angry. He 
was angry because the minerals 
were not all within his reach, but 
he was also happy that the Ethi- 
cals could make a mistake. 

The Stranger called his people 
the Ethicals. It was they who re- 
surrected the entire human 
species and all subhumans intel- 
ligent enough to have a language. 
The Resurrection had been ac- 
complished by purely scientific 
means. The supernatural had 
played no part in raising— or re- 
creating — the dead. All who had 
died between 2,000,000 B.C. and 
2008 A.D. had been resurrected. 
The only exceptions were idiots 
and those who had died before the 
age of five. The Ethicals had re- 
stored everyone whole and in ex- 
cellent health, but sterile. They 
had rejuvenated those who need- 
ed it. And now, twenty-one years 
after the first day of resurrec- 
tion, all looked as if they were no 
more than twenty-five years old. 



But, despite the godlike power 
of the Ethicals, they could make 
mistakes and errors. 

That fact did not help the hu- 
mans imprisoned forever be- 
tween sheer mountains 20,000 feet 
high in a valley about 9.9 miles 
wide on the average. They would 
be imprisoned for thousands of 
years, if not forever, unless 
Samuel Langhorne Clemens could 
build his Riverboat. 

S AM went to the unpainted pine 
cabinet, opened a door, and 
pulled out an opaque glass bottle. 
It held about twenty ounces of 
bourbon donated by people who 
did not drink. He downed about 
three ounces, winced,«'snorted, 
slapped his chest and put the bottle 
back. Hah! Nothing better to start 
off the day with, especially when 
you woke up from a nightmare 
that should have been rejected by 
the Great Censor of Dreams. If, 
that is, the Great Censor had any 
love and regard for one of his fa- 
vorite dream-makers, Sam Clem- 
ens. Maybe the Great Censor did 
not love him after all. It seemed 
that very few did love Sam any 
more. He had to do things he did 
not want to do in order to get the 
boat built. 

And then there was Livy, his 
wife on Earth for thirty-four years. 

He swore, caressed a nonexis- 
tent moustache, reached back into 
the cabinet and pulled the bottle 



THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



11 




out again. Another snort. Tears 
came, but whether engendered by 
the bourbon or the thought of Livy, 
he did not know. Probably, in this 
world of complex forces and mys- 
terious operations — and opera- 
tors — the tears were caused by 
both. Plus other things which his 
hindbrain did not care to let him 
peep into at this moment. His 
hindbrain would wait until his 
forebrain was bent over, tying its 
intellectual shoestrings, and 
would then boot the posterior of 
said forebrain. 

He strode across the bamboo 
mats and looked through the port 
window. Down there, about two 
hundred yards away, under the 
branches of the thousand-foot 
irontree, was a round, conical- 
roofed, two-room hut. Inside the 
bedroom would be Olivia Lang- 
don Clemens, his wife — his ex- 
wife— and the long, lanky, tremen- 
dously beaked, weak-chinned 
Savinien de Cyrano II de Berge- 
rac, swordsman, libertine and 
man-of-letters. 

‘‘Livy, how could you?" Sam 
said. “How could you break my 
heart, the heart of Your Youth?" 

A year had passed since she had 
shown up with Cyrano de Berge- 
rac. He had been shocked, more 
shocked than he had ever been in 
his seventy-four years on Earth and 
his twenty-one years on the River- 
world. But he had recovered from 
it. Or he would have recovered if 



he had not gotten another shock, 
though a lesser one. Nothing could 
exceed the impact of the first. 
After all, he could not expect Livy 
to go without a man for twenty- 
one years. Not when she was young 
and beautiful again and still 
passionate and had no reasonable 
hope of ever seeing him again. He 
had lived with a half-dozen women 
himself, and he could not expect 
chastity or faithfulness from her. 
But he had expected that she 
would drop her mate like a monkey 
drops a heated penny when she 
found him again. 

Not so. She loved de Bergerac. 

He had seen her almost every 
day since the night she had first 
come out of the mists of The River. 
They spoke politely enough and 
sometimes, when the atmosphere 
seemed just right, they cracked 
their reserve and laughed and joked 
just as they had on. Earth. Some- 
times, briefly, but undeniably, 
their eyes told each other that the 
old love was vibrating between 
them. Then, when he felt that he 
had broken out with longing, just 
like the hives, so he told himself 
later, laughing while he felt like 
crying, he had stepped toward 
her, despite himself, and she had 
stepped back to Cyrano’s side if he 
happened to be there or looked 
around for him if he wasn’t. 

Every night she was with that 
dirty, uncouth, big-nosed, weak- 
chinned, Adam’s-appled, but

colorful, strong-minded, witty, 
vigorous, talented, scary French- 
man. The virile frog, Sam mut- 
tered. He could imagine him leap- 
ing, croaking with lust, toward 
the white, blackly outlined, 
curving figure of Livy, leaping, 
croaking . 

He shuddered. This was no good. 
Even when he brought women up 
here secretly — though he did not 
have to hide anything — he- could 
not quite forget her. Even when he 
chewed dreamgum he could not 
forget her. If anything, she sailed 
into the drug-tossed sea of his 
mind more strongly, blown by the 
winds of desire. The good ship 
Livy, white sails bellying out, the 
trim cleancut curving hull . 

And he heard her laughter, that 
lovely laughter. That seemed to be 
the hardest thing to endure. 

He walked away and looked out 
through the fore ports. He stood by 
the oak pedestal and the big- 
spoked riverboat’s wheel he had 
carved. This room was his “pilot- 
house” and the two rooms behind 
made up the “texas.” The whole 
building was on the side of the hill 
nearest to the plain. It was on 
thirty-foot stilts and could be 
entered through a staircase or 
ladder (to use a nautical term) on 
the starboard side or through a 
port directly from the hill behind 
the rear chamber of the texas. On 
top of the pilothouse was a large 
bell, the only metal bell in the 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



world, as far as he knew. As soon 
as the waterclock in the corner 
struck six, he would clang the big 
bell. And the dark valley would 
slowly come to life. 

H 

M ists still overhung The 
River and the edge of the 
banks, but he could see the huge 
squat mushroom shape of the 
grailstone a mile and a half down 
the slope of the plain just by the 
water’s edge. A moment later, he 
saw a boat, toy size, emerge from 
the mists. Two figures jumped out 
and pulled the dugout onto the 
shore, then ran off to the right. The 
light from the skies was bright 
enough for Sam to see them, 
though he sometimes lost them 
when buildings intervened. After 
going around the two-story pottery 
factory they cut straight into the 
hills. He lost them then but it 
seemed that they were heading for 
John Plantegenet’s log “palace.” 

So much for the sentinel system 
of Parolando. Every quarter mile 
on The River’s front was guarded 
by a hut on thirty-foot stilts with 
four men on duty. If they saw any- 
thing suspicious, they were to beat 
on their drums, blow their bone 
horns and light their torches. 

Two men slipping out of the fog 
to carry news to King John, ex- 
King John, of England? 

Fifteen minutes later Sam saw a 

13 




shadow running between shadows. 
The rope attached to the small bell 
just inside the entrance rang. He 
looked through the starboard 
port. A white face looked up at 
him. Sam’s own spy, William 
Grevel, famous wool merchant, 
citizen of London, died in 1401 in 
the Year Of Our Lord. There were 
no sheep or, in fact, any mammals 
other than man along The River. 
But the ex-merchant had shown 
great aptitude for espionage, and 
he loyed to stay up all night and 
skulk around. 

Sam beckoned to him; Grevel 
ran up the “ladder” and entered 
after Sam had unbarred the thick 
oak door. 

Sam said, in Esperanto, **Salu~ 
ton, leutenanto Grevel. Kio 
estas?** 

(Translation: “Hello, Lieutenant 
Grevel. What’s the matter?”) 

Grevel said, "‘"‘Bonan matenon, 
Estro. Ciu grasa fripono, Rego 
Johano, estas jus akceptita duo 
spionoj. ” 

(Translation: “Good morning. 
Boss. That fat rascal. King John, 
has just received two spies.”) 

Neither Sam nor Grevel could 
understand each other’s English, 
but they got along very well in Es- 
peranto, except now and then. 

Sam grinned. Bill Grevel had let 
himself down from the limb of an 
irontree, passing directly over a 
sentry, and down a rope onto the 
edge of the roof of the two-story 



building. He had passed through 
the bedroom, where three women 
slept, and then crawled to the top 
of the staircase. John and his 
spies, a twentieth-century Italian 
and a sixth-century Hungarian, 
were at a table below Grevel. The 
two had reported the results of 
their trip upRiver. John was fur- 
ious and justly so, from his view- 
point. 

Sam, hearing Grevel’s report, al- 
so became furious. 

“He tried to assassinate Arthur 
of New Brittany? What is that man 
trying to do, ruin all of us?” 

He paced back and forth, stop- 
ped, lit a big cigar and began pac- 
ing again. Once he stopped to in- 
vite Grevel to a bite of cheese and a 
glass of wine. 

It was one of the ironies of 
Chance or, perhaps, of the Ethi- 
cals, for who knew what things 
they arranged, that King John of 
England and the nephew he had 
murdered most foully should have 
been located within thirty-two 
miles of each other. Arthur, 
Prince of Brittany of dead Earth, 
had organized the peoples among 
whom he found himself into a 
state he called New Brittany. 
There were very few old Bretons in 
the ten-mile long territory he 
ruled, but that did not matter. New 
Brittany it was. 

It had taken eight months be- 
fore Arthur had discovered that his 
uncle was his neighbor. He had 



14 



IF 




traveled incognito to Parolando 
to verify with his own eyes the 
identity of John, the uncle who had 
slit his throat and dropped his 
weighted body into the Seine. 
Arthur wanted to capture John 
and keep him alive for as long as 
possible under exquisite torture. 
Killing John would only bar him, 
possibly forever, from getting his 
revenge. John, murdered, would 
awake the next day some place 
thousands of miles away on The 
River. 

But Arthur had sent emissaries 
demanding that John be given up 
to him. These demands had been 
rejected, of course, though only 
Sam’s sense of honor and his fear 
of John, kept him from agreeing 
to Arthur's demands. 

Now John had sent four men to 
assassinate Arthur. Two had been 
killed; the others had escaped with 
minor wounds. This would mean 
invasion. Arthur not only had 
wanted revenge on John, he would 
like to get possession of the 
meteorite iron. 

'OETWEEN Parolando and New 
-■-^Brittany, a fourteen-mile 
stretch of the right bank of The 
River was known as Chernsky's 
Land, or in Esperanto, dernskujo. 
Chernsky, a sixteenth-century 
Ukrainian cavalry colonel, had re- 
fused an alliance with Arthur. But 
the nation immediately to New 
Brittany's north was governed by 



lyeyasu. He was a powerful and 
ambitious person, the man who 
had established the Tokugawa 
Shogunate in 1600 with its capital 
at Yedo, later called Tokyo. Sam’s 
spies said that the Japanese and 
the Breton had met six times. 

Moreover, just to the north of 
lyeyasujo was Kleomanujo. This 
was governed by Cleomenes, a king 
of Sparta and half-brother to that 
Leonidas who held the pass at 
Thermoplyae. Cleomenes had 
met three times with lyeyasu and 
Arthur. 

Just south of Parolando was an 
eleven-mile stretch called Publia, 
after its king, Publius Crassus. 
Publius had been an officer in 
Caesar's cavalry during the Gallic 
campaigns. He was inclined to be 
friendly, although he extracted a 
big price for letting Sam cut down 
his timber. 

South of Publia was Tifonujo, 
ruled by Tai Fung, one of Kublai 
Khan's captains, killed on Earth 
when he fell drunk off a horse. 

And south of Tifonujo was Soul 
City, headed by El wood Hacking 
and Milton Firebrass. 

Sam stopped and glared from 
under bushy brows at Grevel. ‘The 
hell of it. Bill, is there isn’t much 1 
can do. If 1 tell John I know about 
his trying to murder Arthur, who 
may deserve murder, for all 1 
know, then John knows that I've 
got spies inside the house. And 
he'll just deny everything, ask that 



THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT

I bring his accusers forth — and you 
know what would happen to them, 
to you.'" 

Grevel paled. 

Sam said, “Start your blood 
running again. I won’t do it. No. 
The only thing to do is to keep 
quiet and watch for developments. 
But I’m choking up to here with 
keeping quiet. That man is the 
most despicable I ever met— and if 
you knew my vast range of ac- 
quaintances, including pub- 
lishers, you would feel the depth of 
my words.’’ 

“John could be a tax-collector,” 
Grevel said, as if he had plumbed 
the depths of insult. And he had, 
for him. 

“It was a bad da>r^en I had to 
agree- to take John on as a part- 
ner,’’ Sam muttered, blowing 
out smoke as he turned toward 
Grevel. “But if I hadn’t taken him 
in. I’d have been robbed of my 
chance at the iron.” 

H e DISMISSED Grevel after 
thanking him. The skies just 
above the mountains across The 
River were paling. Soon the entire 
vault would be rosy on the edges 
and blue above, but it would be 
some time before the sun cleared 
the mountain. Before then, the 
grailstones would be discharging. 

He washed his face in a basin, 
combed his thick bush of reddish 
hair straight back, applied the 
toothpaste with the tip of his 



finger to his teeth and gums, and 
spat. Then he fastened a belt with 
four sheaths and a bag dangling 
from a strap and put it around his 
waist. He placed a long towel 
around his shoulders as a cape, 
picked up a cane of oak shod with 
iron and, with the other hand, 
picked up the grail. He went down 
the stairs. The grass was still wet. 
It rained every night at three 
o’clock for a half-hour and the val- 
ley did not dry until after the sun 
came up. If it were not for the 
absence of disease germs and 
viruses, half the valley’s humans 
would have died of pneumonia and 
flu long ago. 

Sam was young and vigorous 
again, but he still did not like to 
exercise, As he walked, he thought 
of the little railway he would like 
to build from his house to the edge 
of The River. But that would be too 
restrictive. Why not build an auto- 
mobile with a motor that burned 
wood alcohol? 

People began joining him; he 
was kept busy with ‘*Saluton!** 
and '*Bonan Matenon!” At the end 
of his walk, he gave his grail to a 
man to put on a depression on the 
top of the gray granite mushroom- 
shaped rock. About six hundred of 
the gray cylinders were placed in 
the depression and the crowd re- 
treated to a respectful distance. 
Fifteen minutes later, the rock 
erupted with a roar. Blue flames 
soared twenty-five feet high and 



16 



IF 




thunder echoed from the moun- 
tain. The appointed grail keepers 
for the day got onto the rock and 
passed the cylinders around. Sam 
took his back to the pilothouse, 
wondering on the way why he did 
not delegate someone to carry his 
grail down for him. The truth was, 
a man was so dependent on the 
grail, he just could not trust it out 
of his sight. 

Back in the house, he opened the 
lid. In six containers in snapdown 
racks were breakfast and various 
goodies. 

The grail had a false bottom in 
which were concealed an energy- 
matter converter and programed 
menus. This morning he got bacon 
and eggs, toast with butter and 
jam, a glass of milk, a slice of 
cantaloupe, ten cigarettes, a 
marihuana stick, a cube of dream- 
gum, a cigar and a cup of some de- 
licious liqueur. 

He settled down to eat with 
gusto and got, instead, a bad taste. 
Looking out through the star- 
board port (so he wouldn't see into 
Cyrano’s door), he saw a youth on 
his knees before his hut. The fel- 
low was praying, his eyes closed, 
his hands church-steepled. He wore 
only a kilt and a spiral bone from 
a Riverfish suspended by a 
leather string around his neck. His 
hair was dark blond, his face was 
broad and his body was muscular. 
But his ribs were beginning to 
show. 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



The praying man was Hermann 
Goering, a missionary of the 
Church of the Second Chance. 

Sam swore and reared up from 
his chair, knocking it backward, 
picked it up and moved his break- 
fast from his desk to the big round 
table in the center of the room. The 
fellow had spoiled his appetite 
more than once. If there was one 
thing Sam could not stand, it was 
an ex-sinner, and Hermann 
Goering had sinned more than 
most and was now, by way of 
compensation, holier than most. 
Or so it seemed to Sam, though 
Goering claimed that he was the 
lowliest of the low — in a sense. 

Take your damned arrogant 
humility away, Sam had said. Or 
at least take it downwind . 

If it had not been for the Mag- 
na Carta which Sam had drawn 
up (over King John’s protests, 
thus repeating history), Sam 
would have kicked Goering and 
his followers out long ago. Well, 
at least a week ago. But the Carta, 
the constitution of the state of 
Parolando, the most democratic 
constitution in the history of 
mankind, gave total religious 
freedom and total freedom of 
speech. Almost total, anyway. 
There had to be some limitations. 

But his own document forbade 
Sam to stop the missionaries of the 
Church of the Second Chance from 
preaching. 

Yet if Goering continued to pro- 

17 




test, to make speeches, to convert 
more to his doctrine of pacifist 
resistance Sam Clemens would 
never get his Riverboat. Her- 
mann Goering had made a symbol 
of the boat; he said that it 
represented man's vanity, greed, 
lust for violence and disregard of 
the Creator’s designs for the world 
of man. 

Man should not build river- 
boats, he should built more stately 
mansions of the soul. All man 
needed now was a roof over his 
head to keep off the rain and thin 
walls for a little privacy now and 
then. Man no longer had to earn 
his bread by the sweat of his brow. 
His food and.drink were given to 
him with nothing expected in re- 
turn, not even gratitude. Man had 
time to determine his destiny. But 
man must not transgress on oth- 
ers, not rob them of their posses- 
sions, their love or their dignity. He 
must respect others and himself. 
But he could not do this through 
delivery, robbery, violence, con- 
tempt. He must . 

S AM turned away. Goering had 
some fine sentiments to which 
Sam subscribed. But Goering was 
wrong if he thought that licking 
the boots of the people who had 
put them here was going to lead to 
any Utopia or salvation for their 
souls. Humanity had been tricked 
again; it was being used, misused 
and abused. Everything, the 



resurrection, the rejuvenation, 
freedom from disease, free food 
and liquor and smokes, freedom 
from hard work or economic neces- 
sity, everything was an illusion, a 
candy bar to lead baby mankind 
into some dark alley 
where . Where what? Sam did 
not know. But The Mysterious 
Stranger had said that mankind 
was being tricked in the cruelest 
hoax of all, even crueler than the 
first hoax, that of life on Earth. 
Man had been resurrected and put 
on this planet as the subject of a 
tremendous scholarly study. That 
was all. And when the studies were 
completed Man would go down in- 
to darkness and oblivion once 
more. Cheated again. 

But what did the Stranger have 
to gain by telling this to certain- 
selected men? Why had he chosen a 
small number to help him defeat 
his fellow Ethicals? What was the 
Stranger really after? Was he ly- 
ing to Sam and Cyrano and 
Odysseus and the others whom 
Sam had not yet met? 

Sam Clemens did not know. He 
was as much in The Great Dark as 
he had been on Earth. But he did 
know one thing for certain. He 
wanted that Riverboat. 

The mists had cleared away; 
breakfast time was over. He 
checked the water clock and then 
rang the big bell on the pilothouse. 
As soon as it had ceased tolling the 
wooden whistles of the sergeants 



18 



IF 




began shrilling. Up and down the 
ten-mile stretch of the Rivervalley 
known as Parolando the whistles 
shrilled. Then the drums began to 
beat and Parolando went to work. 

m 

T here were 17,000 people in 
the state and the Riverboat 
would be taking only one hundred 
and twenty. Twenty of these al- 
ready knew for sure they would be 
going. Sam and Joe Miller, Lo- 
thar von Richthofen, Van Boom, 
de Bergerac, Odysseus, three en- 
gineers and King John and their 
hutmates, had been promised. 
The rest would know whether or 
not they had worked for nothing a 
few days before the boat sailed. At 
that time, the names would be writ- 
ten on slips of paper and placed in- 
side a big wire cage. The cage 
would be whirled around and 
around, and then Sam would stop 
it, and, blindfolded, would reach 
in and pull out, one after the oth- 
er, one hundred names. And these 
lucky ones would be the crew of the 
Not For Hire. 

The Not For Hire had about 
5,000,000 miles to travel, if The 
Stranger could be believed. Aver- 
aging about 335 miles every twen- 
ty-four hours, it would take over 
forty-one years to reach the end of 
The River. But it would not aver- 
age that much, of course. The crew 
would have to put into shore for 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



extensive vacations on land and 
there would be repairs to be made. 
In fact, the Riverboat might wear 
out, although Sam planned on 
taking many spare parts. Once the 
boat was on its way it could not put 
back for parts or pick them up any- 
where else. There would be no met- 
al of any consequence from this 
place on. 

It was strange to think that he 
would be about one hundred and 
forty years old when he got to the 
headwaters of The River. 

But what was that when he had 
thousands of years of youth to go? 

He looked through the bow 
ports. The plain was full of people 
streaming down from the hills to 
the factories. Behind him the hills 
would be alive with others on their 
way to the factories in the hills. 
And a small army would be work- 
ing on the big dam to the north- 
west, near the base of the moun- 
tains. A concrete wall was being 
constructed between two steep 
hills to dam up the water flowing 
from a spring near the top of the 
mountain. When the lake behind 
the dam was full, its overflow 
would be used to drive electrical 
generators to power the mills. 

At present the electrical energy 
needed came from a grailstone. A 
giant stepdown transformer of 
aluminum took the energy three 
times a day, sent it through brob- 
dingnagian aluminum wires to a 
two-story device known as the ba- 

- ^ 1 ^ 




tacitor. This was a late twentieth- 
century electronic discovery 
that could accept hundreds of 
kilovolts in a hundredth of a 
microsecond and could dis- 
charge it at any rate from a tenth of 
a volt to one hundred kilovolts. It 
was the prototype of the bataci- 
tor that would be put on the River- 
boat. At present the energy was 
chiefly used in a cutting device 
made by van Boom that sliced 
through the pieces of nickel-iron 
dug up on the plain — the energy 
could also be moderated to melt 
the metal. The aluminum for the 
wires and the batacitor had been 
laboriously and expensively made 
from aluminum^ silicate derived 
from the clay under the grass along 
the base of the mountains. But that 
supply had run out and now the 
only economically feasible source 
was in Soul City. 

Sam sat down at his desk, pulled 
out a drawer and removed a tall 
book bound in fish-bladder leath- 
er; the pages were bamboo-fiber 
paper. It was his diary, The 
Memoirs of a Lazarus, For the 
time being he was using mk made 
of water and tannic acid from oak 
bark and carbon from finely 
ground charcoal in suspension to 
write down the day-by-day hap- 
penings and his reflections. 
When the technology of Parolan- 
do was improved enough he would 
use an electronic recorder that 
van Boom had promised him. 



He had no sooner started writ- 
ing than the drums began beating. 
The big bass drums represented 
dashes; the small soprano drums, 
dots. The code was Morse; the lan- 
guage, Esperanto. Von Richthofen 
would be landing soon. 

S AM stood up to look out 
again. A half a mile away was 
the bamboo catamaran on which 
Lothar von Richthofen had 
sailed downRiver only ten days 
ago. Through the starboard ports 
Sam saw a squat figure with tawny 
hair coming out of the gateway of 
King John's log palace. Behind 
him came bodyguards and syco- 
phants. 

King John was making sure that 
von Richthofen did not give Sam 
Clemens any secret messages 
from Elwood Hacking. 

The ex-monarch of England, 
present co-ruler of Parolando, 
wore a kilt with red and black 
checks, a poncholike arrange- 
ment of towels and knee-length, 
red-leather Riverdragon boots. 
Around his thick waist was a wide 
belt with a number of sheaths con- 
taining steel daggers, a short 
sword and a steel axe. One hand 
held a steel rod coronet, one of 
many sources of contention be- 
tween Sam and King John. Sam 
did not want to waste metal on 
such useless anachronisms, but 
John had insisted and Sam had 
given in. 



20 



IF 




Sam found some satisfaction in 
thinking about the name of his lit- 
tle nation. Parolando in Esperanto 
meant pair land and was so called 
because two men governed it. But 
Sam had not mentioned to John 
that another translation could be 
Twain Land, 

John followed a hard-dirt path 
around a long, low factory build- 
ing and then he was at the foot of 
the staircase of Sam's quarters. A 
bodyguard, a big thug named 
Sharkey, pulled the bell rope and 
the little bell tinkled. 

Sam stuck his head out and 
shouted, "'Come aboard, John!” 

John looked up at him from pale 
blue eyes and motioned to 
Sharkey to precede him. John was 
cautious about assassins and he 
had reason to be. He was also re- 
sentful about having had to come 
to Sam— but he had known that 
von Richthofen would report to 
Sam first. 

Sharkey entered, inspected 
Sam's pilothouse and looked 
through the three rooms of the tex- 
as, Sam heard a growl, as low and 
powerful as a lion's, from the rear 
bedroom. Sharkey came back 
swiftly and closed the door. 

Sam smiled and said, “Joe Mil- 
ler may be sick, but he can still eat 
ten Polish prizefighters for break- 
fast and call for a second helping.” 

Sharkey did not reply. He sig- 
naled through the port that John 
could come up. 

the fabulous riverboat 



The catamaran was beached now 
and the tiiiy figure of von Richt- 
hofen was coming across the 
plain, holding his grail in one hand 
and the wooden winged ambas- 
sadorial staff in the other. 
Through the other port Sam could 
see the lanky figure of de Berger- 
ac leading a platoon toward the 
south wall. Livy was not in sight. 

John entered. Sam said, “Ao/ia/f 
matenon, JohanoV" 

It galled John that Sam refused 
to address him as Via Rega 
Mosto — Your Majesty — in pri- 
vate. La Konsulo — the Con- 
sul — was their correct title and 
even that came reluctantly from 
Sam’s lips. Sam encouraged oth- 
ers to call him La EstrOy The Boss, 
because that angered John even 
more. 

John grunted and sat down at the 
round table. Another bodyguard, 
a big dark proto-Mongolian with 
massive bones and immensely 
powerful muscles, Zaksksromb, 
who presumably had died about 
30,000 B.C., lit up a huge brown 
cigar for John. Zak, as he was 
known, was the strongest man in 
Parolando, with the exception of 
Joe Miller. And it could be argued 
that Joe Miller was not a 
man — or, at least, certainly not 
homo sapiens, 

S AM wished Joe would get out 
of bed, because Zak made him 
nervous. But Joe was sedating 

21 




himself with dreamgum. Two 
days ago a chunk of siderite had 
slipped from a crane’s tongs as Joe 
was passing beneath it. The op- 
erator swore it had been an acci- 
dent, but Sam had his suspicions. 
John would want to get rid of 
Sam’s bodyguard, who was incor- 
ruptible and who could scare off a 
legion of assassins just ,by boo- 
ing at them. 

Sam puffed on his cigar and 
said, “Hear anything about your 
nephew lately?’’ 

John did not start, but his eyes 
did widen a trifle. He looked at 
Sam across the table. 

“No, should 1?’’ 

“1 just wondered. I’ve been 
thinking about asking Arthur 
down for a conference. There’s no 
reason why you two should be try- 
ing to kill each other. This isn’t 
Earth, you know. Why can’t we 
call off old feuds? What if you did 
drop him off in a sack into the 
estuary? Let bygones be by- 
gones. We could use his wood and 
we need more limestone for calci- 
um carbonate and magnesium. 
He’s got plenty.’’ 

John glared, then hooded his 
eyes and smiled. 

Tricky John, Sam thought. 
Smooth John. Despicable John. 

“To get wood and limestone 
we'd have to pay with steel arms,” 
John said. “I’m not about to per- 
mit my dear nephew to get his 
hands on more steel.” 



“Just thought I’d broach the 
subject to you,’’ Sam said, “be- 
cause at noon — ” 

John stiffened. “Yes?” 

“Well, I thought I’d bring up the 
subj^t to the Council. We might 
have a vote on it.” 

John relaxed. “Oh?” 

Sam thought. You think you’re 
safe. You’ve got Pedro Ansdrez 
and Frederick Rolfe on your side 
and a five~to~three vote in the 
Council is a nay vote . 

Once again he contemplated sus- 
pending the Magna Carta so that 
things could be done that needed to 
be done. But that might mean civil 
war and that could mean the end of 
the dream. 

He paced back and forth while 
John described in a loud voice and 
sickening detail his latest con- 
quest of his latest blonde. Sam 
tried to ignore the words; he still 
got mad because the man boasted, 
although by now any woman wKo 
accepted John had only herself to 
blame. 

T he little bell tinkled. Lothar 
von Richthofen entered. He 
was a well-built youth with long 
blond hair and handsome, some- 
what Slavic, features. He looked 
like a less stocky and better look- 
ing Goering. The two had known

Arabs are driving him out of his 
mind. Hacking became a Mos- 
lem on Earth, did you know that? 
First he was a Black Muslim, an 
American home-grown variety. 
Then he became a real Moslem, 
made a pilgrimage to Mecca and 
was quite certain that the Arabs, 
even if they were white, were not 
racists. 

“But the massacre of the 
Sudanese blacks by the Sudanese 
Arabs and the history of Arabic 
enslavement of blacks disturbed 
him. Anyway, these nineteenth- 
century Wahhabi are not racists — 
they’re just religious fanatics and 
too much trouble. He didn’t say 
so, but I was there^ten days and I 
saw enough. The Wahhabis want 
to convert Soul City to their brand 
of Moslemism and if they can't do 
it peacefully, they’ll do it bloodily. 
Hacking wants to get rid of them 
and of the Dravidians, who seem to 
regard themselves as superior. 
Anyway, Hacking will continue to 
furnish us bauxite if we will send 
him all our black citizens in re- 
turn for his Wahhabi and Dravidi- 
an citizens. Plus an increased 
amount of steel arms. Plus a 
larger share in the raw siderite." 

Sam groaned. King John spat on 
the floor. Sam scowled and said, 
""Merdo, Johano! Not even a 
Plantagenet gobs on my floor! 
Use the spittoon or get out!" 

He forced him.self to push down 
his rage and frustration as King 

24 



John bristled. Now was not a time 
to bring about a confrontation. 
The vainglorious ex-monarch 
would never back down on the 
spitting issue, which was actually 
trifling. 

Sam gestured self-deprecating- 
ly and said, “Forget about it, 
John. Spit all you want to!’’ But he 
could not resist adding: “As long 
as I have the same privilege in your 
house, of course.’’ 

J OHN growled and popped a 
chocolate into his mouth. He 
used the growling, grinding voice 
that indicated that he, too, was 
very angry but was imposing great 
self^-control. 

“This Saracen, Hacking, gets 
too much. I say we have kissed his 
black hand long enough. His de- 
mands have slowed down the build- 
ing of the ship—’’ 

“Boat, John," Sam said. “It’s a 
boat, not a ship." 

""Boato, smoato. I say, let us 
conquer Soul City, put the citizens 
to the sword and seize the min- 
erals. Then we will be able to make 
aluminum on the spot. In fact, we 
could build the boat there. And, to 
make sure that we are not inter- 
fered with and have the wood 
needed, we should conquer all the 
states between us and Soul City." 
Powermad John. 

Yet, Sam was inclined to think 
that he might, for once, be right. In 
a month or so Parolando would 



IF 




have the weapons that would en- 
able it to do just what John was 
proposing. Except that Publia 
was friendly and their bills were 
not high, and Tifonujo, though it 
demanded much, had permitted 
itself to be stripped of trees. It was 
possible that both states planned 
to use the nickel-iron they got for 
their wood to make weapons so 
that they could attack Parolando. 

The savages across The River 
were probably planning the same 
thing. 

"‘Tm not through," von 
Richthofen said. '‘Hacking made 
his demands about the trading of 
citizens on a one-to-one basis. But 
he won’t come to any agreement 
unless we send a black to deal with 
him. He says he was insulted when 
you sent me, since I'm a Prussian 
and a Junker to boot. But he'll 
overlook that, since we didn’t 
know any better, if we send him a 
member of the Council the next 
time. One who's black." 

Sam’s cigar almost fell out. 

“We don't have a black Coun- 
cilman." 

“Exactly. What Hacking is say- 
ing is that we had better elect one." 

John passed both hands through 
his shoulder-length tawny hair and 
then stood up. His pale blue eyes 
were fiery under the lion-colored 
eyebrows. 

“This Saracen thinks he can tell 
us how to conduct our internal af- 
fairs. I say, war!" 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



Sam said, “Now, just a minute. 
Your Majesty. You have good rea- 
son to be mad, as the old farmer 
said — then fell in. But the truth 
is, we can defend ourselves quite 
well — but we cannot invade and 
occupy any large territory." 

“Occupy?" John shouted. “We 
will slaughter half and chain the 
other half!" 

“The world changed much after 
you died, John — uh. Your Majesty. 
Admittedly there are other forms 
of slavery than the outright form, 
but I don’t want to get into an 
argument about definitions. 
There is no use making a fuss, as 
the fox said to the hens. We just ap- 
point another Councilman, pro 
tern. And we send him to Hack- 
ing." 

“There is no provision in the 
Magna Carta for a pro tern Coun- 
cilman," Lothar said. 

“We change the Carta," Sam 
said. 

“That'll take a popular elec- 
tion." 

John snorted disgust. He and 
Sam Clemens had gone through 
too many blazing arguments 
about the rights of the people. 
Sam held firm on these points, and 
Sam was La Estro, The Boss, to 
the greatest number of citizens, 
even if the two Consuls theoreti- 
cally held equal powers. 

“There’s one other thing," 
Lothar said, still smiling but with 
an exasperated note in his voice. 



25 




'"Hacking asks that Firebrass be 
allowed to visit here for a tour of 
inspection. Firebrass is especially 
interested in seeing our airplane.'' 

J OHN sputtered. "He asks if we 
care if he sends a spy!" 

"I don't know/' Sam said. 
"Firebrass is Hacking's chief of 
staff. He might get a different idea 
of us. He's an engineer— I think 
he had a Ph.D., too, in physics. I've 
heard about him. What did you 
find out, Lothar?" 

"He impressed me very much," 
von Richthofen said. "He was 
born in nineteen seventy-four in 
Syracuse, New York. His father 
was black and his mother was half - 
Irish and half-Iroquois Indian. 
He was in the second party to land 
on Mars and the first to orbit 
Jupiter—" 

Sam was thinking, men really 
did that. Landed on the Moon and 
then Mars. Right out of Jules 
Verne and Frank Reade, Jr. Fan- 
tastic, yet no more fantastic than 
this world. Or, indeed, than the 
mundane world of 1910. None of 
it could be explained in a manner 
to satisfy any reasonable man. It 
was all incredible. 

"We'll put it up to the Council, 
today, John," Sam said. "If you 
have no objection. We'll have a 
general election on the pro tern 
Councilman. I personally favor 
Uzziah Cawber." 

"Cawber was a slave, wasn't 



he?" Lothar said. "I don't know. 
Hacking said he didn't want any 
Uncle Toms sent." 

Once a slave, always a slave, 
Sam thought. Even when a slave 
revolts, kills and is killed as a pro- 
test against his slavery -resur- 
rected, he still does not think of 
himself as a free man. He was 
born and raised in a world soaked 
with the rotten essence of slave- 
dom and every thought he thinks, 
every move he makes, is stained 
with slavery, subtly altered with 
slavery, Cawber was born in 1841 
in Montgomery, Alabama, He was 
taught to read and write. He served 
in the house of his master as his 
secretary. He killed his master's 
son in 1863, escaped and went 
West and became a cowboy, of all 
tnings, and then a miner. He was 
killed with a Sioux spear in 1876; 
the ex-slave killed by a man about 
to become a slave, Cawber is de- 
lighted with this world — or claims 
to be — because no man can en- 
slave him here or keep him en- 
slaved. But he is the slave of his 
own mind and of the reactions of 
his nerves. Even when he holds his 
head high he will jump if some- 
body cracks a whip and his head 
will bow before he can stop it .. 

Why, oh, why, had man been 
brought back to life? Men and 
women were ruined by what had 
happened on Earth and they 
would never be able to undo the 
damage. The Second Chancers 



26 



IF 




claimed a man could change, en- 
tirely change. But the Second 
Chancers were a pack of dream- 
gummers. 

•‘If Hacking calls Cawber an 
Uncle Tom, Cawber will kill 
him,” Sam said. “I say, let’s send 
him.” 

John’s tawny eyebrows rose. 
Sam knew what he was thinking. 
Perhaps he could use Cawber, 
one way or another. 

Sam looked at the waterclock. 
“Time for the inspection tour. 
Care to come along, John? I’ll be 
with you in a minute,” and he sat 
down at his desk to make a few 
more entries in his diary. 

That gave John the chance to 
leave first, as befitted the ex-Kiftg 
of England and a good part of 
France. Sam thought it was ridicu- 
lous to worry about who preceded 
whom, yet he disliked John so 
much he could not bear to let him 
gain even this minor victory. 
Rather than argue about it, or just 
walk out ahead of him, and so 
cause John to throw a fit, he pre- 
tended he had work to do. 

IV 

S AM caught up with the group, 
which included the six Council- 
men, just outside the nitric-acid 
factory. They went through the 
factories swiftly. The stinks 
emanating from the nitric and sul- 



furic acids, from the destructive 
distillation of wood to make 
alcohol, acetone, creosote, turpen- 
tine and acetic acid, the for- 
maldehyde vats and the treatment 
of human excrement and lichen 
scraped off the mountains to 
extract potassium nitrate — these, 
combined, were enough to make a 
hyena lose its breakfast. They 
were roasted and deafened in the 
steel mill and the grinding mills 
and the forges and blacksmith 
shops. They were covered with a 
white dust in the limestone mills 
and magnesium factory. In the 
aluminum factory they were again 
roasted, deafened — and stunk out. 

The gunsmith shop up in the hills 
was not operating at the moment. 
Except for distant noises, it was 
quiet. But it was not beautiful. The 
earth had been dug up, the trees cut 
down and smoke from the fac- 
tories up the River was black and 
acrid along the mountains. 

Van Boom, the late twentieth- 
century, half Zulu, half Afrikaans 
chief engineer, met them. He was 
a handsome man with a dark 
bronze skin and curly hair. He 
stood about six-three and weighed 
about two hundred and fifty. He 
had been born in 1976 in a ditch 
during The Bloody Years. 

He greeted them cordially 
enough (he liked Sam and toler- 
ated John), but he did not smile as 
usual. 

“It’s ready,” he said, “but I 

27 



THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 




want my objections recorded. It's 
a nice toy and makes a lot of noise 
and looks impressive and will kill 
a man. But it's wasteful and in- 
efficient." 

"You make it sound like a Con- 
gressman," Sam said. 

Van Boom led them into the high 
doorway of the bamboo building, 
where a steel handgun lay on a 
table. Van Boom picked it up and 
even in his big hand the gun was 
huge. He strode past the others 
and out into the light of the sun. 
Sam was exasperated. He had 
held out his hand for the gun and 
the fellow had ignored him. If Van 
Boom intended to demonstrate it 
outside, why hadn't he said so in 
the first place? 

"Engineers," Sam muttered. 
Then he shrugged. You might as 
well hit a Missouri mule between 
the eyes with your pinkie as try to 
change Van Boom's ways. 

Van Boom held up the gun so 
that the sunshine twinkled against 
the silvery gray metal. "This is the 
Mark I pistol," he said. "Called so 
because The Boss invented it." 

Sam's anger melted like ice in a 
Mississippi River thaw. 

"It's a breech-loading, single- 
shot, flintlock hand weapon with a 
rifled barrel and a breakdown 
action." 

He held the gun in his right hand 
and said, "You load it so. You 
press forward the lock switch on 
the left side of the barrel. This re- 



leases the breech lock. You then 
press down the barrel with the left 
hand. This action forces the trig- 
ger guard into the grip, where the 
guard acts as a lever to cock the 
hammer." 

He reached into a bag strapped 
to his belt and removed a large 
brown hemispherical object. 
"This is a bakelite or phenol-for- 
maldehyde-resin bullet. It is sixty 
caliber. You press the bullet, so, 
until it engages the lands of the 
barrel." 

He removed from his bag a shiny 
package with black contents. 

"This is a charge of black gun- 
powder wrapped in cellulose ni- 
trate. Some time in the future,., 
we'll have cordite instead of gun- 
powder. If we use this gun, that is. 
Now, I insert the load into the 
chamber with the primer end first. 
The primer is a twist of nitrate 
paper impregnated with gun- 
powder. Then I lift the barrel with 
my left hand, thus, locking it into 
place. The Mark I is now ready to 
fire. But, for emergency, if the 
primer does not ignite, you can 
pour priming powder into the 
touchhole just forward of the rear 
sight. In case of misfire, the gun 
may be cocked with the right 
thumb. Note that this flash vent on 
the right side of the action shield 
protects the shooter's face." 

A MAN had brought out a large 
wooden target and had inserted 



28 



IF 




it in a frame on four legs. The tar- 
get was about twenty yards away. 
Van Boom turned toward it, held 
out the gun, clenched both hands 
and sighted along the front and 
rear sights. 

“Get behind me, gentlemen," 
he said. "The heat of the passage 
through the air will burn off the 
surface of the bullet and leave a 
thin trail of smoke which you may 
be able to see. The plastic bullet 
has to be of such large caliber be- 
cause of its light weight. But this 
increases the wind resistance. If 
we decide to use this gun — which I 
definitely am against — we might 
increase the caliber to .75 in the 
Mark II. The effective range is 
about fifty yards, but the accuracy 
is not good beyond thirty yards 
and nothing to brag about within 
that range." 

The flint was in the hammer. 
When Van Boom would pull the 
trigger, the hammer would fall 
and scrape along the file-like sur- 
face of the frizzen. The frizzen cov- 
ered the priming pan and should be 
knocked forward by the flint, un- 
covering the primer twist of the 
powder charge. 

There was a click as the sear let 
the hammer go, a flash as the 
primer twist burned —and a boom- 
ing. The click-flash-boom took al- 
most as long as it would take to say 
each word and Van Boom had had 
time between the click and the 
boom to bring the gun back into 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



line after it had been jarred away 
by the impact of the heavy ham- 
mer and flint. 

The bullet did leave a very faint 
trail of smoke, quickly dissipated 
by the fifteen-mile-an-hour wind. 
Sam, looking past Van Boom's 
arm, could see the bullet curve out 
and then back, carried by the 
wind. But Van Boom must have 
been practicing, because the bullet 
struck near the bull’s eye. It weht 
halfway into the soft pine, 
shattered and left a large hole in 
the wood. 

"The bullet won't penetrate 
deeply into a man," Van Boom 
said, "but it will leave a large hole. 
And if it hits near bone, the frag- 
ments should break the bone." 

The next hour was spent busily 
and happily with the Consuls and 
Councilmen taking turns shooting. 
King John was especially delighted, 
though perhaps a little awed, be- 
cause he had never seen a gun be- 
fore. His first experience with gun- 
powder had come several years 
after he had been resurrected and 
he had seen only bombs and wood- 
en rockets. 

At last Van Boom said, "If you 
keep up, gentlemen, you will 
exhaust our supply of bullets — and 
it takes a lot of labor and materials 
to make these bullets. Which is one 
reason why I object to making 
any more. My other reasons are: 
one, the gun is accurate only at 
close range; two, it takes so long to 

29 




load and shoot that a good bow- 
man could drop three pistol 
handlers while they’re loading and 
stay outside the effective range of 
the guns. Moreover, a plastic 
bullet isn’t recoverable, whereas 
an arrow is.” 

Sam said, “That’s a lot of non- 
sense! The mere fact that we would 
have these guns would demon- 
strate our technological and mili- 
tary superiority. We’d scare the 
enemy half to death before the 
battle started. Also, you forget 
that it takes a long time to train a 
good bowman, but anyone can 
shoot one of these after a rela- 
tively short lesson.” 

“True,” Van Boom ^aid. “But 
could they hit anyone? Besides, 1 
was thinking of making steel 
crossbows. They can’t be handled 
as fast as longbows, but they don’t 
require any more training than 
guns do and the bolts are recover- 
able. And they’re a hell of a lot 
more deadly than these noisy 
stinking gadgets.” 

“No sir,” Sam said. “No, sir. 1 
insist that we make at least two 
hundred of these. We’ll outfit a 
new group, the Parolando Pisto- 
leers. They’ll be the terror of The 
River — you watch them; you’ll 
see!” 

F or a change King John was 
on Sam’s side. He stated that 
the first two pistols should go to 
Sam and to himself and the next 



dozen to their bodyguards. Then 
the new group could be organized 
and trained. 

Sam was grateful for the back- 
ing, but he told himself to check on 
the men who formed the Pis- 
toleers. He did not want it made up 
largely of men loyal to John. 

Van Boom made no effort to 
hide his disgust. “I’ll tell you 
what. I’ll take a good yew bow and 
twelve arrows and stand fifty yards 
away. At a signal all eight of you 
can advance on me, firing at will 
with your Mark I’s— and I’ll drop 
all eight of you before you get close 
enough to hit me. Is it a deal? I’m 
willing to lay my life on the line.” 

“Don’t be childish,” Sam said. 

Van Boom rolled his eyes up- 
ward. “/’m childish? You’re jeo- 
pardizing Parolando — and your 
boat — because you want guns to 
play with!” 

“Just as soon as the guns are 
made you can start making all the 
bows you want,” Sam said. 
“Look! We’ll make armor, too, for 
the Pistoleers! That should dis- 
pose of your objections! Why 
didn’t I think of that before? Why, 
our men will be dressed up in steel 
that’ll repel the Stone Age weap- 
ons of the enemy as if they were 
straws. Let the enemy shoot his 
yew bows with his flint-tipped ar- 
rows. They’ll bounce off the steel 
and the Pistoleers can take their 
time and blow the enemy into the 
next county!”

IF 




‘‘You forget that weVe had to 
barter our ore and even metal wea- 
pons for wood and other materials 
we need/’ Van Boom said. ‘The 
enemy will have arrows with steel 
tips that can drive through armor. 
Don’t forget Crecy and Agin- 
court.” 

“There’s just no dealing with 
you,” Sam said. “You must be 
half Dutch — you’re so stubborn.” 

“If your thinking is representa- 
tive of the thinking of white men, 
then I’m glad I’m half Zulu,” Van 
Boom said. 

“Don’t get huffy,” Sam replied. 
“Congratulations on the gun. Tell 
you what, we’ll call it the Van 
Boom-Mark I. How’s that?” 

“I’d just as soon not have my 
name attached to it,” the engineer 
said. “So be it. I’ll make your two 
hundred guns. But I’d like to make 
an improved version. You know, 
the Mark II we talked about?” 

“Let’s make two hundred of 
these first, then we’ll start on the 
Mark II,” Sam said. “We don't 
want to mess around so long try- 
ing to get the perfect weapon that 
we suddenly find we don’t have any 
at all. Still — ” 

He talked for a while about the 
Mark 11. He had a passion for 
mechanical gadgets. On Earth he 
had invented a number of things, 
all of which were going to make 
him a fortune. And there was the 
Paige typesetting machine, into 
which he had sunk — and it had 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



sunk — all the wealth he had made 
from his books. 

Sam thought of the typesetting 
monster and how that wonderful 
contraption had bankrupted him. 
For a second, Paige and Van 
Boom were one and he felt guilty 
and a little panicky. 

V AN BOOM next complained 
about the materials and the la- 
bor put into the AM P-1, their aeri- 
al machine prototype. Sam ig- 
nored him. He went with the oth- 
ers to the hjcingar, which was on the 
plains about a mile north of Sam’s 
quarters. The plains had been left 
undisturbed in front of the bamboo 
hangar so that the plane, when it 
flew, would have a narrow landing 
strip. The craft was only partly 
finished but would look almost as 
skeletal and frail when ready to fly 
as it did now. 

“It’s similar to some of the 
planes built in nineteen-ten,” von 
Richthofen said. “I’ll be exposed 
from my waist up when I sit in the 
cockpit. The whole machine looks 
more like a metal dragonfly than 
anything else. The main object is to 
test out the efficiency of the wood- 
alcohol-burning motor and our 
materials.” 

Von Richthofen promised that 
the first flight would be made with- 
in three weeks. He showed Sam the 
plans for the rocket launchers 
to be mounted under the wings. 
“The plane can carry about six 

31 




rockets, but it’ll mostly be good 
only for scouting. It won’t go fast- 
er than forty miles an hour against 
the wind. But it’ll be fun flying it.” 

Sam was disappointed that the 
plane wasn’t a two-seater. He had 
never flown. But von Richthofen 
said the next prototype would be a 
two-seater and Sam would be his 
first passenger. 

‘‘After you’ve tested it out,” 
Sam said. He expected John to 
protest about this and to insist that 
he be taken up first. But evidently 
John was not too eager to fly. 

The last stop was at the boat- 
yard, located halfway between the 
hangar and Sam’s house. The craft 
within the pine-log enclosure 
would be completed within a week. 
The Firedragon I was the amphi- 
bious prototype of the boat that 
would be the launch for the big 
boat. It was a beautiful machine, 
made of thick magnalium, about 
thirty-two feet long, shaped like a 
U.S. Navy cruiser with wheels, 
with three turrets on its sleek top 
deck. It was powered by steam, 
burned wood alcohol, could oper- 
ate in water or on land, carried a 
crew of eleven and was, so Sam 
declared, invincible. 

He patted the cold gray hull and 
said, “Why should we worry about 
having bowmen? Or having 
anything but this? This juggernaut 
could crush a kingdom all by itself. 
It has a steampowered cannon the 
like of which the world. Earth or 



this planet, has never seen. That is 
why it is steamdriven and why it 
has such a huge boiler.” 

All in all, the tour had made him 
happy. It was true that the plans 
for the great River boat had barely 
been started. But those took time. 
It was vital that the state be well 
protected at first, and just making 
the preparations was fun. He 
rubbed his hands and puffed on a 
new cigar, drawing the green 
smoke deeply into his lungs. 

And then he saw Livy. 

He beloved Livy, sick for so 
many years, and dead, finally, in 
Italy, in 1904, 

Restored to life and youth and 
beauty, but not, alas, to him. 

S HE was walking toward him, 
carrying her grail by its han- 
dle, wearing a white, scarlet-edged 
kilt that came halfway down her 
thighs and a thin white scarf for a 
bra. She had a fine figure, good 
legs, handsome features. Her 
forehead was broad and satiny 
white. Her eyes were large and 
luminous. Her lips were full and 
shapely; her smile, attractive; her 
teeth, small and very white. She 
customarily wore her dark hair 
parted, combed down smooth in 
front but twisted into a figure 
eight in the back. Behind an ear she 
wore one of the giant crimson rose- 
like blooms that grew from the 
vines on the irontrees. Around her 
neck was a necklace made of the 



32 



IF 




convoluted red vertebrae of the 
hornfish. 

Sam's heart felt as if it were 
being licked by a cat. 

She swayed as she walked to- 
ward him and her breasts bounced 
beneath the semiopaque fabric. 
Here was his Livy, who had always 
been so modest, had worn heavy 
clothes from the neck down to the 
ankle and had never undressed 
before him in the light. Now she 
reminded him of the half-naked 
women of the Sandwich Islands 
and he felt uneasy. He knew why. 
His queasiness among the natives 
had been as much due to their un- 
wanted attraction for him as 
repulsion, each feeling dependent 
on the other and having nothing to 
do with the natives. 

Livy had had a puritanical up- 
bringing but she had not been 
ruined by it. On Earth she had 
learned to drink and to like beer, 
had even smoked a few times and 
had become an infidel or, at least, 
a great doubter. She had even 
tolerated his constant swearing and 
had let loose with a few blisterers 
herself if the girls were not around. 
The accusations that she had 
censored his books and so emas- 
culated them were off the target. 
He had done most of the censoring 
himself. 

Yes, Livy had always shown 
adaptability. 

Too much. Now, after twenty 
years of absence from him, she had 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



fallen in love with Cyrano de Ber- 
gerac. And Sam had the uneasy 
feeling that that wild Frenchman 
had awakened in her something 
that Sam might have awakened if 
he had not been so inhibited 
himself. But after these years on 
The River and the chewing of a 
certain amount of dreamgum he 
had lost many of his own inhibi- 
tions. 

It was too late for him. 

Unless Cyrano left the scene . 

“Hello, Sam," she said in En- 
glish. “How are you on this fine 
day?" 

“Every day is fine here," he said. 
“You can't even talk about the 
weather, let alone do anything 
about it." 

She had a beautiful laugh. 
“Come along with me to the 
grailstone," she said. “It's almost 
time for lunch." 

Every day he swore not to come 
near her because to do so hurt too 
much. And every day he took 
advantage of the smallest chance to 
get as close to her as he could. 

“Jim-dandy," he said. “Come 
along. How's Cyrano?" 

“Oh, very happy because he's 
finally going to get a rapier. 
Bildron, the swordsmith, prom- 
ised that he'd have the first 
one— after yours and the other 
Councilmen's, of course. He'd 
taken so long to reconcile him- 
self to the fact that he would never 
hold a metal sword in his hand 

33 




again. Then he heard about the 
meteroite and came here — and 
now the greatest swordsman in 
the world will have a chance to 
show everybody that his reputa- 
tion wasn’t a lie, as some say.” 

“Now Livy,” he said. “I didn’t 
say people had lied about his repu- 
tation. 1 said that maybe they 
exaggerated some. I still don’t be- 
lieve that story about his holding 
off two hundred swordsmen all by 
himself.” 

“The fight at the Porte de Nesle 
was authentic! And it wasn’t two 
hundred, you’re the one pumping 
it up, Sam, just as you always do. 
There was a crowd of hired thugs 
that could have been a hundred or 
might just as wellTiave been. Even 
if there had been only twenty-five, 
the fact is that Cyrano attacked 
them all single-handed to save his 
friend, the Chevalier de Lignieres 
—he killed two and wounded sev- 
en and ran the rest of them off. 
That is God’s truth!” 

“I don’t want to get into an 
argument about the merits of your 
man,” he said. “Or about any- 
thing. Let’s just talk like we used to 
when we had so much fun— before 
you got sick.” 

She stopped, her face grim. 

“I always, knew you resented 
my illness, Sam.” 

“No, that wasn't it,” he said. “I 
think I felt guilty that you were 
sick, as if somehow I were to 
blame. But I never hated you for 

34 



it. I hated myself if I hated any- 
one. 

“I didn’t say you hated me,” she 
said. “1 said you resented my ill- 
ness and you showed it in many 
ways. Oh, you may have thought 
you were always noble and gentle 
and loving — and most of the time 
you were — you really were. But 
there were enough times when you 
looked, you spoke, you muttered, 
you gestured — how can I describe 
exactly how you were? I can’t, but 
I knew you resented me, some- 
times loathed me, because i was 
sick.” 

“I didn’t!” he cried so loudly 
that a number of people stared. 

“Why argue about it?” she said. 
“Whether you did or not doesn’t 
matter now. I loved you then and 1 
still do, in a way. But not as I did.” 

He was silent during the rest of 
the walk across the plain to the big 
mushroom-shaped stone. The 
cigar tasted like burning skunk 
cabbage. 

Cyrano was not present. He was 
superintending the building of a 
section of the wall which would 
eventually guard the shore of The 
River. Sam was glad. It was dif- 
ficult enough for him to see Livy 
alone but when she was with the 
Frenchman, he could not endure 
his thoughts. 

In silence, he and Livy parted. 

A BEAUTIFUL woman with 
lovely, honey-colored hair ap- 

IF 




preached him and he was able to 
set aside his feelings about Livy 
for a while. The woman’s name 
was Gwenafra. She had, on evi- 
dence, died at about the age of. 
seven in a country that must have 
been Cornwall about the time the 
Phoenicians came there to exploit 
the tin mines. She had been resur- 
rected among people of whom 
none spoke her ancient Celtic lan- 
guage and had been adopted by a 
group that spoke English. From 
her description, one of them had 
been that Sir Richard Francis 
Burton whom Sam had thought 
he’d seen on the shore shortly be- 
fore the meteorite struck. Burton 
and his friends had built a small 
sailboat and set out for the head- 
waters of The River— as might 
have been expected of a man who 
had spent half his life exploring in 
the wildernesses of Africa and the 
other continents. On Earth Bur- 
ton had sought the headwaters of 
the Nile and had found, instead. 
Lake Tanganyika. But on this 
world he had again been seeking 
the source of a river - the greatest 
river of them all— undaunted by 
the prospect that it might be ten 
million miles long or even twenty. 

After little more than a year his 
boat had been attacked by evil 
men and one had stuck a stone 
knife into little Gwenafra and 
thrown her into The River, where 
she had drowned. She had awak- 
ened the next day on the banks 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



somewhere far up in the oorthern 
hemisphere. The weather was 
colder, the sun weaker and the 
people there said that you did not 
have to go more than twenty 
thousand grailstones before you 
were in an area where the sun was 
always half above, half below the 
mountains. And there lived hairy, 
ape-faced men ten feet tall and 
weighing seven to eight hundred 
pounds. 

(This was true, Joe Miller had 
been one of the titanthrops there.) 

The people up River who 
adopted her spoke Suomenkieltd, 
which in English meant Finnish. 
DownRiver a little way were the 
Swedes. These were twentieth-cen- 
tury people who lived a peaceful 
life and Gwenafra grew up rela- 
tively happy with loving foster 
parents. She learned Finnish, 
Swedish, English, a Chinese dia- 
lect of the fourth century B.C. and 
Esperanto. 

She drowned again by accident 
one day and woke up here. She still 
remembered Burton; she cherished 
a childhood crush she had had for 
him. But, being a realist, she was 
ready to love other men. And she 
had— and had just split with one, 
Sam had heard. She wanted a 
man who would be faithful to her 
and these were not easy to find in 
this world. 

Sam was very much attracted to 
her. The only thing that had kept 
him from asking her to move in 

35 




with him had been the fear of 
angering Livy. That fear was ridi- 
culous — she had no claim on him 
as long as she was living with 
Cyrano. And she had made it plain 
that she did not care what he did in 
his private life — or his public life. 
Nevertheless, against all logic, he 
was afraid to take another woman 
as his hutmate. He did not want to 
snap the last thin link. 

He chatted with Gwenafra a 
while and confirmed that she was 
still unattached. 

V 

L unch was upsetting. The 
“roulette wheel" concealed 
somewhere in the false bottom of 
the grail, the wild caster of dice, 
came up with a meal that only a 
Goshute Indian could have swal- 
lowed and even he might have 
gagged a little. Sam threw out all 
the food, but was able to console 
himself with two cigars, cigarettes 
and six ounces of an unfamiliar 
but delicious liqueur. Just smell- 
ing it sent his taste buds into a 
dance. 

The meeting with the Council 
and John took three hours. After 
much wrangling and a number of 
votes, it was decided to put to the 
people the question of amending 
the Carta so that a pro tern Coun- 
cilman could be elected. John held 
up things for an hour, arguing that 
a vote wasn't needed. Why couldn't 



the Council simply say that the 
amendment was passed? No 
amount of explaining ever seemed 
to clarify such matters in John's 
head. It was not that he was un- 
intelligent. It was just that he was 
not emotionally suited to compre- 
hend democracy. 

The vote was unanimous to ac- 
cept Firebrass as Hacking's offi- 
cial visiting fireman. But he would 
have a close eye kept on him. 

After all this John rose and 
made a speech, occasionally 
lapsing from Esperanto into Nor- 
man French when he was over- 
powered by emotion. He thought 
that Parolando should invade 
Soul City before Soul City in- 
vaded Parolando. The invasion 
should be launched as soon as the 
handguns and the armored amphi- 
bian, Firedragon /, were ready. 
However, it might be best to test 
the mettle of their metal and the 
troops on New Brittany first. His 
spies were certain that Arthur 
planned to attack them soon. 

John's two toadies backed him, 
but the others, including Sam, 
voted them down. John's face be- 
came red and he scolded and 
drummed his fingers on the oak 
table, but nobody decided to 
change his mind. 

After supper the drums relayed a 
message from Hacking. Firebrass 
would” be arriving tomorrow, 
some time before noon. 

Sam retired to his office. By the 

IF 



36 




light of lamps burning fish- 
oil— soon they would have elec- 
tricity — he and Van Boom and 
Tanya Velitsky and John Wesley 
O’Brien, the engineers, discussed 
their ideas about the Riverboat 
and drew rough sketches on paper. 
Paper was still scarce, but they 
would need enormous amounts to 
draw their blueprints. Van Boom 
said that they should wait until 
they were able to make a certain 
kind of plastic. Lines could be 
drawn on this with magnetized 
“pens" and corrections could 
easily be made by demagnetizing. 
Sam replied that that was fine. 
But he wanted to start building the 
Riverboat the moment the 
amphibian was completed. Van 
Boom said that he could not agree 
to that. Too many things were in 
the way. 

It was late when Sam said good 
night. 

Van Boom pulled the Mark I 
gun out of a large bag. “We have 
ten of these now,” he said. “This 
one is yours. Compliments of 
Parolando’s Engineering Corps. 
And here are twenty packages of 
powder and twenty plastic bul- 
lets. You can sleep with them un- 
der your pillow.” 

Sam thanked him. Van Boom 
left and Sam barred the door. 

He went into the back room to 
talk to Joe Miller a while. Joe was 
still awake, but he said he was tak- 
ing no sedation that night. He 

the fabuloOs riverboat 



would be getting up in the 
morning. Sam bade the giant good 
night and went into his bedroom, 
next to the pilothouse. He drank 
two shots of bourbon and lay 
down. After a while he managed 
to doze, though he was afraid that 
the three-o’clock rain would wake 
him as usual and he would have 
trouble getting back to sleep. 

H e awoke but the rain was 
long past. Shouts came from 
somewhere and then an explosion 
that rattled the ports in the pilot- 
house. Sam leaped out of bed, 
wrapped a kilt around his waist, 
seized an axe in one hand and ran 
into the pilothouse. He suddenly 
remembered his pistol, but de- 
cided he would go back for it when 
he found out what was going on. 

The River was still smothered in 
fog, but hundreds of dark figures 
were spilling out of it and the tops 
of tall masts sticking out above it. 
Torches were flaring all over the 
plains and in the hills. Drums were 
beating. 

There was another explosion. A 
brightness in the night with bodies 
flying in all directions. 

He looked through the star- 
board port. The gates of the Iqg 
wall around King John's palace 
were open and men were stream- 
ing out. Among them was the 
stocky figure of John. 

By then more men had ap- 
peared out of the mists over The 

37 




River. Bright starlight showed 
them lining up and moving out, 
rank after rank. The first of the in- 
vaders were by now in the great 
factories and advancing swiftly 
across the plain toward the foot- 
hills. Some explosions occurred 
inside factories as bombs were 
thrown to dislodge the defenders. 
And then a red tail flared out, 
disappeared, and something 
black shot toward him. Sam threw 
himself to the floor. A roar came 
beneath him, the floor heaved and 
the glass ports blew in. A wiff of 
acrid smoke came to him and was 
gone. 

He should get up and run, he re- 
alized, but he couldn't. He was 
deafened and frozen. Another 
rocket would be coming his way 
and that one might be closer. 

A giant hand gripped his shoul- 
der and pulled him up. Another 
hand slid under his legs and he was 
being carried out. The arms and 
the chest of the giant were very 
hairy and as hard-muscled and as 
warm as a gorilla's. A voice as 
deep as if it were at the end of a 
railroad tunnel rumbled, "‘Take 
it eathy, Bothth." 

'Tut me down, Joe," Sam said. 
"Tm all right, except for my 
shame. And that's all right, too, 1 
ought to feel ashamed." 

His shock was fading and a 
sense of relative calm flowed in to 
fill the vacuum. The appearance 
of the massive titanthrop had 



steadied him. Good old Joe— he 
might be a dumb subhuman and 
sick at the moment, but he was 
still worth a battalion. 

Joe had put on his suit of leather 
armor. In one hand was the haft of 
an enormous double-headed axe 
of steel. The face under the 
hooded helmet was low-browed, 
bulging with bone bars and but- 
tresses and massive javys. It was 
the face of a being between ape 
and man, though closer to man. 
But the unexpected feature, the 
comical yet terrifying feature, 
was the nose. This was the huge 
outlandishly protrudihg nose of 
the proboscis monkey. It pro- 
voked stares and laughter, though 
few had the foolhardiness to laugh 
in Joe's face. He was ten feet tall 
and weighed almost as much as a 
pair of lions. 

"Who are they?" he rumbled. 
"They from Thoul Thity ?" 

"I don't know," Sam said. "Do 
you feel up to fighting? How's the 
head?" 

"It hurtth. Yeah, I can fight 
okay. Vere do ve go from here?" 

Sam led him downhill toward 
the men collecting around John. 
He heard his name called and 
turned to see the tall lanky figure 
of de Bergerac, Livy by his side. 
She carried a small round shield of 
leather-covered oak and a steel- 
tipped spear. Cyrano held a long, 
dully shining blade. Sam's eyes 
widened. It was a rapier. 



38 



IF 




Cyrano said, ^''Morbleur He 
switched to Esperanto. *‘Your 
smith gave this to me just after 
supper— he said there was no 
sense in waiting." Cyrano 
whipped the rapier, cutting the air 
with a sharp sound. "Tve come 
alive again. Steel — sharp steel!" 



A NEARBY explosion made 
them all leap for the ground. 
Sam waited until he was sure that 
another rocket was not coming 
and then looked at his pilothouse. 

It had received a direct hit; its 
front was blown open; a fire was 
racing through it and would soon 
be in the texas. His diary was gone 
but he could retrieve his grail 
later. It was indestructible. 

In the next few minutes the 
wooden missiles, tails flaming, 
arched out, wobbling, from 
wooden bazookas held on the 
shoulders of the Parolandoj 
rocketeers. The missiles landed 
near and sometimes among the 
enemy and exploded with gouts of 
fire and much black smoke, quick- 
ly carried away by the wind. 

Three runners arrived to report. 
The attack had been launched 
from three places, all from The 
River. The main body was concen- 
trated here, apparently to seize the 
Parolandoj leaders, the larger 
factories and the amphibian. The 
other two armies were about a mile 
away on each side. The invaders 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



were composed of men from New 
Brittany and Kleomanujo and the 
Ulmaks from across The River. 
The Ulmaks were savages who 
had lived in Siberia circa 30,000 
B.C. and whose descendants had 
migrated across the Bering Straits 
to become Amerinds. 

So much for King John's spy ser- 
vice, Sam ihoughiM nless— un- 
less he is in on the attack. But if he 
were he wouldn't be standing out 
here where he's likely to get killed 
any moment . 

Anyway, Arthur of New Brit- 
tany would never make a deal with 
his murderer uncle. 

The rockets continued to arc 
down from both sides, the five- 
pound warheads with their rock 
fragnient shrapnel taking a toll. 
The Parolandoj had the advan- 
tage; they could lie flat while their 
rockets exploded among upright 
targets. The invaders had to keep 
moving, otherwise they might just 
as well go home. 

Nevertheless, it was frightening 
to lie on the ground and wait for 
the next noisy blast and hope that it 
would not come closer than the last 
one. There were screams from the 
wounded that were not, however, 
as heartrending as they would 
have been if Sam had not been 
nearly deafened. Then, suddenly, 
the rockets had quit blowing up 
the world. A huge hand shook 
Sam's shoulder. He looked up to 
see that many around him were 

39 




getting to their feet. The ser- 
geants were yelling into the 
stunned ears of their men to form a 
battle array. The enemy was so 
close now that neither side was us- 
ing the missiles or else they had all 
been launched. 

Ahead was a dark body, a sea of 
screaming whooping fiends. They 
ran up the hill and the first, sec- 
ond, and third ranks fell, pierced 
by arrows. But those behind did 
not break, they leaped over the fall- 
en and kept on coming. Suddenly, 
the archers were being hammered 
down or thrust through or clubbed. 

Sam kept close behind Joe 
Miller, who moved ahead slowly, 
his axe rising and falling. And 
then the giant was down, and the 
enemy were struggling on top of 
him like a pack of jackals on a lion. 
Sam tried to get to him; his axe 
smashed through a shield and a 
head and an uplifted arm and then 
he felt a burning pain along his 
ribs. He was pushed back and 
back, while he slashed away with 
the axe. He stumbled over a pile of 
wood. Above him was the burning 
floor of his house; the stilts were on 
fire. 

He turned on his side and there 
was the handgun, the Mark I, that 
he had left by his bedside. Near it 
lay three packages of powder 
with the nitrate-soaked twists and a 
number of the plastic bullets. 

His axe was gone; it had be- 
come wedged in a skull. 

40 



T WO men whirled by him in a 
dance, their hands gripping 
each other, straining, grunting with 
the strain, glaring into each other’s 
bloody faces. They stopped and 
Sam recognized King John— his 
opponent was taller but not as 
thickly built. He, too, had tawny 
hair and eyes that were blue in the 
flames overhead. 

Sam broke open the pistol, put 
in the bullet and the charge as he 
had done that morning up in the 
hills, locked the barrel and rose to 
his feet. The two men still strug- 
gled, one slipping back a little, 
then the other, trying to throw 
each other. John held a steel knife 
in his right hand, the other man a 
steel axe. 

Sam looked around; no one was 
coming at him. He stepped for- 
ward and extended the muzzle of 
the big pistol, holding it steady 
with both hands. He pulled the trig; 
ger, the click sounded, the gun was 
jarred to one side by the heavy 
hammer, there was a flash, he had 
the gun back in line, a boom, a 
cloud of smoke — and John’s assail- 
ant fell to one side, the entire right 
side of his skull blown away. 

John fell gasping onto the 
ground. Then he raised himself, 
looking at Sam, who was reload- 
ing the gun. "'Many thanks, part- 
ner! That man was my nephew, 
Arthur!’' 

Sam did not reply. If he had 
been thinking he would have 

IF 




waited until Arthur had killed 
John and then blown Arthur's head 
off. It was ironic that he, Sam, who 
had much to gain by John’s death, 
should be responsible for saving 
him. Moreover, he could not ex- 
pect gratitude from John. The 
man had no such thing in his soul. 

Sam completed reloading the 
pistol and strode away, looking 
for Joe Miller. But he saw Livy 
reeling backward as a big Ul- 
mak, whose left arm dangled 
bloodily, drove her back with blows 
of a stone axe on her shield. Her 
spear had been broken and in a 
few seconds he would have beaten 
her to her knees or shattered the 
shield. Sam reversed the pistol and 
broke the Ulmak’s skull from be- 
hind with the butt of his gun. Livy 
fell exhausted and weeping on the 
ground and he would have gotten 
down to comfort her. But she 
seemed all right and he did not 
know where Joe Miller was. He 
plunged into the embattled mass 
and saw Joe on his feet again, de- 
molishing heads, trunks and arms 
with sweeps of his great axe. 

Sam stopped a few paces from a 
man who was coming up from be- 
hind Joe, a large axe in both hands. 
Sam fired and the bullet took part 
of the man's chest off. 

A minute later, the invaders 
were running for their lives. The 
sky was graying; by its light it was 
evident that Parolandoj were 
coming in from north and south. 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



The other two columns had been 
shattered and the reinforcements 
were outnumbering thejnvaders. 
Moreover, they brought rockets, 
which blew up the boats and canoes 
waiting for the defeated. 

Sam felt too exhilarated to be 
depressed by the losses and the 
damage. For the first time came 
out of the blue funk that always 
seized him during a fight. He 
actually enjoyed the battle 
during the last ten minutes. 



A MOMENT later his pleasure 
was gone. A wild-eyed and 
naked Hermann Goering, his 
scalp caked with blood, appeared 
on the battleground. His arms 
were raised straight up and he was 
shouting, ‘‘Oh, brothers and sis- 
ters! Shame! Shame! You have 
killed, you have hated, you have 
lusted for the blood and the ecstasy 
of murder! Why did you not throw 
down your arms and take in your 
enemies with love? Let them do 
with you what they would? You 
would have died and suffered but 
final victory would have been 
yours! The enemy would have felt 
your love— and the next time he 
might have hesitated before again 
waging war. And the time after 
that and the next time he might 
have asked himself, ‘What am I 
doing? Why am I doing this? 
What good is this? I have gained 
nothing — ' and your love would 

41 




have seeped through the stone over 
his heart and—" 

John, coming up behind 
Goering, struck him on the back of 
the head with the hilt of his knife. 
Goering fell forward and lay on 
his face without moving. 

‘‘So much for traitors," John 
shouted. He stared around wildly 
and then yelled, “Where are 
Trimalchio and Mordaunt?" 

Sam said, “They wouldn’t be 
stupid enough to hang around 
here. You’ll never catch them. 
They’ll know you know they sold 
out to Arthur." 

John's striking of Goering was 
illegal, since free speech was every 
one’s right in Parolandct But Sam 
did not think that arresting John 
would be the right course at that 
moment. 

Sam, too, had felt like hitting 
Goering. 

Livy, still weeping, staggered 
past. Sam followed her to where 
Cyrano sat on a pile of corpses. 
The Frenchman was wounded in a 
dozen places, though not serious- 
ly, and his rapier was bloody from 
tip to guard. He had given a splen- 
did account of himself and his 
weapon. 

Livy threw herself on Cyrano 
and Sam turned away. She had not 
even thanked him for having saved 
her earlier. 

Sam sighed. 

There was a crash behind him. 
He turned. The rest of his house 



had fallen in, bringing the stilts 
with it. 

He felt drained of every atom of 
strength, but there would be little 
rest for him today. The casualties 
and the damage had to be as- 
sessed. The dead had to be taken 
to the rendering factory up in the 
hills, since their fat was used to 
make glycerin. The practice was 
gruesome but necessary and the 
owners of the bodies did not mind. 
Tomorrow they would be alive 
and well again somewhere far 
away along The River. 

In addition, the entire popula- 
tion would have to be kept ready 
for a call to arms and the work on 
erecting the walls along the River- 
edge would have to be speeded up. 
Scouts and messengers would 
have to be sent out to determine 
just what the military situation 
was. The Ulmaks and the 
Kleomenujoj and the New Bretons 
might launch an all-out full-scale 
attack. 

A captain reported that Kleo- 
menes, the leader of Kleomenujo, 
had been found dead near the 
Riveredge, where a piece of rock 
shrapnel had entered his skull. So 
ended the halfbrother of the great 
Spartan, Leonidas, who defended 
the pass of Thermopylos. Or so he 
ended in this area at least. 

Sam appointed some men to 
leave by lx>at immediately for the 
two countries. They were to in- 
form them that Parolando did not 



42 



IF 




intend to take vengeance if the 
new leaders would guarantee 
friendship to Parolando. John 
complained that he should have 
been consulted and there was a 
short but savage argument. Sam 
finally agreed that John was right 
in principle, but there was no time 
to discuss certain matters. John 
informed him that, under the law, 
Sam had to take the time. Any de- 
cision had to be agreed upon by 
both of them. 

Sam hated to agree but John was 
right. They couldn't be giving con- 
tradictory orders. 

They went together to inspect 
the factories. These were not bad- 
ly damaged. The invaders had 
not, of course, wanted to wreck 
them since they had intended to 
use them. The amphibian, the 
Fired ragon /, was untouched. Sam 
shuddered when he thought of 
what might have happened if it 
had been completed and had fall- 
en into the hands of the enemy. 
With it, they could have crushed 
the Parolandoj in the center and 
dug in to fight on the perimeter un- 
til reinforcements came. He 
would set up a large special guard 
around the vehicle. 

He fell asleep after lunch in a 
Councilman's hut. It seemed that 
he had just closed his eyes when he 
was shaken awake. Joe was stand- 
ing over him, breathing bourbon 
fumes from his tremendous 
proboscis. 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



‘The delegathyon from Thoul 
Thity chutht landed." 

“Firebrass," Sam said, standing 
up from the chair. "I forgot all 
about him. What a time for him to 
show up!" 

H e walked down to the 
River, where a catamaran was 
beached near the grailstone. John 
was already there, greeting the 
delegation, which consisted of six 
blacks, two Arabs and two Hindus. 
Firebrass was a short, bronze- 
skinned, curly-haired man with big 
brown eyes flecked with green. His 
huge forehead and shoulders and 
thickly muscled arms contrasted 
with his skinny legs, making him 
look all top. He spoke in Esperanto 
at first but later used English. It 
was a very strange English, full of 
terms and slang that Sam did not 
understand. But there was a 
warmth and openness about Fire- 
brass that made Sam feel good just 
to have him around. 

“We better go back to 
Esperanto," Sam said, smiling 
and pouring three more slugs of 
scotch into Firebrass's cup. "Is 
that spaceman's lingo or Soul City 
dialect?" 

"Marsman's," Firebrass said. 
"Soul City English is pretty wild, 
but the official language, of 
course, is Esperanto, though Hack- 
ing was considering Arabic. But 
he isn't too happy about his Arabs 
any more," he added in a lower 

43 




voice, looking at Abd ar-rahman 
and Ali Fazghuli, the Arab mem- 
bers of his delegation. 

“As you can see,” Sam said, “we 
are in no condition to have a long 
leisurely conference. Not now. 
We have to clean up, get informa- 
tion about what’s going on out- 
side Parolando and set up our de- 
fences. But you are welcome, of 
course, and we’ll get around to 
business within a few days.’’ 

“I don't mind,” Firebrass said. 
“I’d like to look around, if you 
don’t mind.” 

“I don’t, but my co-Consul has 
to give his consent, too.” 

John, smiling as if it hurt his 
teeth to be exposed to the air — and 
it probably did this time — said 
that Firebrass was welcome. But 
he would have to be accompanied 
by a guard of honor every time he 
left the quarters that would be as- 
signed to him. Firebrass thanked 
him but another delegate, 
Abdullah X, protested loudly and 
occasionally obscenely. Fire- 
brass said nothing for a minute 
and then told Abdullah to be po- 
lite, since they were guests. Sam 
was grateful, though he wondered 
if the whole speech had not been 
arranged. 

It had not been easy to sit there 
and listen, though all of the vitriol- 
ics had been hurled at the white 
race in general. Though it trou- 
bled him, Sam had to agree with 
Abdullah; he was right about con- 



ditions as they had been. But old 
Earth was dead; they were living 
in a new world. 

Sam personally conducted the 
delegates to three huts, side by 
side, owned by men and women 
who had been killed last night. 
Then he moved into a hut near the 
delegation. 

Drums boomed by the grail- 
stone. After a minute, drums from 
across The River thundered back 
an answer. The new chief of the 
Ulmaks wanted peace. The old 
chief, Shrubgrain, had been put to 
death and his head would be de- 
livered within the hour by canoe if 
peace could be arranged. Shurb- 
grain had failed his people by lead- 
ing them to defeat. 

Sam gave orders to transmit a 
request for a conference with the 
new chief, Threezburm. 

Drums from Chernsky's Land 
said that lyeyasu, who ruled a 
twelve-mile stretch of land be- 
tween New Brittany and Kleo- 
menujo, had invaded New Brit- 
tany. The news meant that the New 
Bretons would not be bothering 
Parolando, but it also worried 
Sam. lyeyasu was a very ambi- 
tious man. Once he had consoli- 
dated his state with New Brittany 
he might decide he was strong 
enough to take Parolando. 

More drums. Publius Crassus 
sent his congratulations and 
warmest regards, and he would be 
visiting tomorrow to see what he 



44 



IF 




could do to aid Parolando. 

And also to see how hard we*ve 
been hit and if we'd be easy pick- 
ings, Sam thought. So far, Publius 
had been cooperative, but a man 
who had served under Julius 
Caesar was never above a little of 
his own brand of Caesarism. 

Goering, his head wrapped in a 
bloody towel, staggered by, sup- 
ported by two of his followers. 
Sam hoped he would take the hint 
and leave Parolando, but he didn't 
have much faith in the German's 
perceptiveness. 

He went to sleep that night while 
torches burned everywhere over 
the land and guards peered into 
the shadows and the mists. His 
sleep was troubled, despite his in- 
tense fatigue. He tossed and rolled 
and once he awoke, his heart beat- 
ing, his skin cold, certain that 
there was a third person in the hut. 
He fully expected to see the 
shadowy figure of The Mysterious 
Stranger crouched by his bed. But 
nobody was there except the 
monstrous form of Joe stretched 
out on the huge bamboo bed near 
him. 

VI 

T he next morning he arose un- 
refreshed in a refreshed world. 
The three-o'clock rain had washed 
away the blood and the stink of 
gunpowder. The bodies were out 
of sight and the sky was clear and 



blue. Business as usual was re- 
sumed but without about four 
hundred and fifty men and wom- 
en. Half of these were in the ren- 
dering factory; the rest were in the 
hospital. Those who wanted to be 
put out of their misery were given 
their wish. Time had been when an 
axe was the only euthanasiast but 
now, thanks to Parolando's tech- 
nology, the work was done with a 
potassium cyanide pill. 

Some decided to stick it out. In 
time their limbs or eyes would 
grow back. Those afraid of the 
pain boarded The Suicide Express. 
There bodies would go to the ren- 
dering factory. 

Sam's secretary had been killed. 
Sam asked Gwenafra if she would 
like to take Millie's place. Gwen- 
afra seemed very pleased; the new 
position gave her a high status and 
she had made no secret of the fact 
that she liked to be near Sam. 
Lothar vjon Richthofen, however, 
did not seem pleased. 

‘‘Why shouldn't she be my. sec-, 
retary, regardless of her relation- 
ship to you?" Sam said. 

'‘There is no reason," Lothar 
said, "except that I might have a 
very good chance with her if she 
isn't around you much." 

"Let the best man win." 

"My sentiments, too, but 1 don't 
like your wasting her time or lead- 
ing her on. You know that you 
won't take another hutmate as 
long as Livy is here." 



THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



45 




"‘Livy has nothing to say about 
what I do/’ Sam said. 

Lothar smiled slightly and said, 
“Sure, Sam.” 

<5wenafra tagged along with 
him,, taking notes, sending mes- 
sages, receiving them, arranging 
schedules and appointments. 
Though he was very busy, he found 
moments when he could talk and 
joke with her and he felt a warmth 
every time he looked at her. Gwen- 
afra seemed to adore him. 

Two days passed. The twenty- 
four hour shift on the amphibian 
was showing results — it would be 
completed in another two days. 
The Soul City delegation strolled 
around with two -of King John’s 
men watching them. Joe Miller, 
who had gone back to his bed after 
the battle, said he was well again. 
Now Sam had both Gwenafra and 
the titanthrop with him and his 
world seemed much more com- 
fortable, though it was a long way 
from being Utopia. Word came 
via the drum telegraph that 
Odysseus had loaded his ships with 
flints and would be back in a 
month. He had gone as com- 
mander of a ten-boat fleet to bar- 
ter with the chief of Selinujo. On 
Earth she had been Countess Hunt- 
ingdon, Selina Hastings, born 
1707, died 1791. She was now a 
member of the Church of the Sec- 
ond Chance and traded her flint 
with Parolando only because 
Parolando permitted some of 

46 



Goering’s missionaries to preach 
at will in its territory. In return 
for the flint she had been promised 
a small metal steamboat in which 
she proposed to go up and down 
The River and preach. Sam 
thought she was fooling herself. 
The first place she put into she was 
liable to have her throat cut for the 
sake of the boat. But that was her 
business. 



T he Councilmen met with the 
Soul City delegation. Sam 
would have liked to put it off, since 
John was in a mood even uglier 
than usual. One of his women had 
tried to kill him — or at least so he 
claimed. He had been stabbed in 
the side before he broke her jaw 
and knocked her head against the 
corner of a table. The woman had 
died an hour later still uncon- 
.scious, and John’s word that she 
had attacked him first had to be 
accepted. Sam would have liked to 
have collected some neutral eye- 
witness account but that was im- 
possible. 

John was in pain from the stab 
wound, half-drunk with bourbon 
as an anesthetic and smarting be- 
cause the woman had dared to de- 
fy him. He slumped in a large, 
high-backed, ornately carved oak 
chair covered with red hornfish 
leather. One hand was around a 
clay vessel full of whiskey, a 
cigarette dangled from his lips and 

IF 




he glowered at everybody. The 
conference was taking place at a 
round table in the largest room in 
John’s palace. 

Firebrass was talking. “Hack- 
ing once believed in total segrega- 
tion of whites and nonwhites. He 
believed, fiercely believed, that 
whites could never accept, not 
really accept, nonwhite peoples, 
that is, the blacks, Mongolians, 
Polynesians, and Amerindians. 
The only way nonwhites could live 
with dignity, feel beautiful, be a 
people with its own personality 
and pride, was the way of segre- 
gation. Equal but separate. 

“Then his leader, Malcolm X, 
quit the Black Muslims. Malcom 
X saw that he was wrong. Not all 
whites were devils, racist fiends, 
any more than all blacks had flat 
noses. Hacking fled the states to 
live in Algend and there he found 
that it was the attitude that made 
racism, not the color of the skin." 

Hardly an original or surprising 
discovery, Sam thought. But he 
had told himself that he would not 
interrupt. 

“And then the young whites of 
the United States rejected their 
parents' prejudices and they sup- 
ported the blacks in their strug- 
gles. They got right out on the 
streets and demonstrated, rioted, 
laid down their lives for the blacks. 
They genuinely seemed to like 
blacks, not because they thought 
they ought to, but because blacks 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



were human beings and human be- 
ings can be liked or even loved. 

“Hacking, however, wasn't ever 
really at ease with an American 
white, try though he did to think of 
them as human beings. He was 
ruined, just as most whites, most 
older whites, were ruined. But he 
tried and he respected those young 
whites that told their parents, their 
white racist society, to go to hell. 

“Then he died, as everybody 
did, black or white. He found him- 
self among ancient Chinese and he 
wasn’t very happy with them be- 
cause they regarded all peoples 
except the Chinese as inferior.’’ 

Sam remembered the Chinese of 
Nevada and California in the early 
'60s, the hard-working, thrifty, 
quiet, meek, cheery little brown 
men and women. They had taken 
abuse that most people would not 
give a mule, been spat upon, 
cursed, tortured, stoned, robbed, 
raped, suffered about every in- 
dignity and crime that a people 
could suffer. They had had no 
rights whatsoever, no protector 
or protection. And they had never 
murmured, never revolted, they 
just endured. What thoughts had 
those masklike faces hidden? Had 
they, too, believed in the 
superiority of any Chinese to any 
white devil? If so, why had they not 
struck back, not once? 

Firebrass said, “So Hacking left 
in a dugout, floated downRiver 
and after many thousands of miles 

47 




settled down among some blacks 
of seventeenth-century A.D. 
Africa. Ancestors of the Zulus be- 
fore they migrated to southern 
Africa. He learned Zulu but after 
a while he left. Their customs were 
too repulsive and they were too 
bloody minded for him. 

‘Then he lived in an area where 
the people were a mixture of 
Dark Age Huns and dark whites of 
the New Stone Age. They ac- 
cepted him well enough, but he 
missed his own people, the Amer- 
ican blacks. So he took off again 
and was captured by ancient 
Moabites and enslaved, escaped, 
was captured by ancient Hebrews 
and put into grail slavery, escaped 
-again, found a little community 
of blacks who'd been pre-Civil War 
slaves and was happy for a while. 
But their Uncle Tom attitudes and 
their superstitions got on his 
nerves and he took off, sailed 
downRiver and lived with several 
other peoples. Then, one day, 
some big blond whites, Germans 
of some kind, raided the people he 
was with. He fought, was killed. 

“He was resurrected here. 
Hacking became convinced that 
the only happy states on The River 
are going to be made up of people 
with similar colors, similar tastes, 
and of the same terrestrial per- 
iod. Anything else just won't work. 
People here aren't going, to 
change. Back on Earth he could be- 
lieve in progress, because the 



young whites were flexible 
minded. The old ones would die off 
and then the children of the young 
whites would be even more free of 
racial prejudice. But here that just 
isn't going to take place. Every 
man’s set in his ways. So, unless 
Hacking just happened to find a 
community of late twentieth-cen- 
tury whites, he would find no 
whites without racial hatreds or 
prejudices. Of course, the ancient 
whites didn’t have any, but they’re 
too strange for a civilized man.” 

S AM asked, “What’s all this 
leading up to?” 

“We want a homogeneous na- 
tion. We can't get all late twen- 
tieth-century blacks, but we can 
get as black a nation as possible. 
Now, we know that you have ap- 
proximately three thousand blacks 
in Parolando. We would like to 
exchange our Dravidians, Arabs, 
any nonblacks, for your blacks. 
Hacking is making similar pro- 
posals to your neighbors, but he 
doesn't have any lever with them.” 
King John sat up and said, loud- 
ly, “You mean he doesn't have 
anything they want?” 

Firebrass looked coolly at John 
and said, “That's about it. But 
we'll have a lever some day.” 

“Do you mean when you have 
enough steel weapons?” Sam said. 
Firebrass shrugged. 

John crashed his empty cup 
down on the table. “Well, we don't 



48 



IF 




want your Arabs or your 
Dravidians or any of your Soul 
City dregs,” he shouted. ‘‘But I’ll 
tell you what we will do. For every 
ton of bauxite or cryolite or ounce 
of platinum, we will give you one 
of our black citizens! You can 
keep your Saracen infidels or send 
them packing downRiver or 
drown them for ail we care.” 

“Wait a minute,” Sam said. 
“We can’t give our citizens away. 
If they want to volunteer, fine. But 
we don’t just give anybody away. 
This is a democracy.” 

Firebrass’s expression had dark- 
ened at John’s outburst. “I wasn’t 
suggesting that you give anybody 
away,” he said. “We’re not slave 
dealers, you know. What we want 
is a one-per-one-voluntary ex- 
change. The Wahhabi Arabs, 
whom ar-Rahman and Fazghuli 
represent, feel they're unwelcome 
at Soul City and they would like to 
go where they could congregate in 
their own community, form a sort 
of Kasbah, you might say.” 

Sam thought this sounded fishy. 
Why couldn’t they do that just as 
well in Soul City? Or why didn't 
they just get up and leave? One of 
the beauties of this world was that 
ties or property or dependence on 
income did not exist. A man could 
carry everything he owned on his 
back — and building another house 
was easy in a world where new 
bamboo grew two inches a day. 

It was possible that Hacking 



wanted to get his people into 
Paroiando so that they could spy 
or revolt when Hacking invaded. 

Sam said, “We’ll put your 
proposition about the exchange 
to each individual. That’s all we 
can do. Now, does Sinjoro Hack- 
ing plan to keep on supplying us 
with the minerals and with wood?” 
“As long as you keep on send- 
ing us raw ore and steel weapons,” 
Firebrass said. “But Hacking is 
thinking of upping the price.” 
John’s fist smashed into the 
table top again. “We will not be 
robbed,” he shouted. “We are pay- 
ing too much now. Don’t push us, 
Sinjoro Firebrass, or you may 
find yourselves with nothing. 
Not even your lives!” 

“Take it easy. Your Majesty,” 
Sam said quietly. To Firebrass he 
said, “John isn’t feeling well. 
Please forgive him. However, he 
does have a point. We can be 
pushed only so far.” 

A bdullah X, a very big and 
very black man, jumped up 
and pointed a big finger at Sam. 
In English, he said, “You honkies 
had better quit badmouthing us. 
We won’t take any crap from you. 
Mister Whitey! None! Especially 
from a man that wrote a book like 
you did about Nigger Jim. We 
don’t like white racists and we 
only deal with them because 
there’s nothing else to do but that 
just now.” 



THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT

“Take it easy, Abdullah,” Fire- 
brass said. He was smiling and 
Sam wondered if Abdullah's 
speech was part of a well prepared 
program. Probably Firebrass 
was wondering if John's explo- 
sions had been rehearsed. Actors 
didn't have to be politicians, but 
politicians had to be actors. 

Sam groaned and said, “Did you 
read Huckleberry Finn, Sinjoro 
X?" 

Abdullah, sneering, said, “I 
don't read trash.” 

“Then you don't know what 
you're talking about, do you?” 

Abdullah's face darkened. Fire- 
brass grinned. 

“I don't have to read that racist 
crap, man,” Abdullah shouted, 
“Hacking told me all about it and 
what he says is good enough for 
me. 

“You read it and then come 
back and we'll discuss it," Sam 
said. 

“You crazy?” Abdullah said. 
“You know there aren’t any books 
on this world.” 

“Then you lost out, didn't you?" 
Sam said. He was trembling a lit- 
tle; he wasn't used to being talked 
to like this by a black man. “Any- 
way,” Sam said, “this isn't a 
literary tea and discussion group. 
Let's stick to the issue.” 

But Abdullah would not stop 
shouting about the books that 
Sam had written. And John, los- 
ing his temper, leaped up and 



screamed, “Si/e/iitt, negracor 

John had taken the Esperanto 
word for “black” or “negro” and 
infixed the disparaging “-ac-” 
particle. He had gotten his point 
over quite well. 

There was a moment of shock 
and silence. Abdullah X's mouth 
was open, then it closed and he 
looked triumphant, almost 
happy. Firebrass bit his lip. John 
leaned on the table on his fists and 
scowled. Sam puffed on his cigar. 
He knew that John's contempt for 
all humanity had made him in- 
vent the term. John had no racial 
prejudice; he had never seen more 
than a half-dozen blacks during 
his lifetime on Earth. But he cer- 
tainly knew how to insult a per- 
son; the knowledge was second 
nature to him. 

“I’m walking out," Abdullah X 
said. “I may be going home— and 
if 1 do you can bet your whke skin 
that you'll pay hell getting any 
more aluminum or platinum. 
Mister Charlie." 

Sam rose to his feet and said, 
“Just a minute. If you want an 
apology, I extend it on behalf of 
all Parolando." 

Abdullah looked at Firebrass, 
who looked away. Abdullah said, 
“I want an apology from him, 
now!" He pointed at King John. 

Sam leaned close to John and 
said softly, “There's too much at 
stake to play the proud monarch. 
Your Majesty! And you may be 



50 



IF 




playing into their hands with your 
little fit. They are up to some- 
thing, you can bet on that. Apolo- 
gize. 

John straightened up and said, 

“I apologize to no man, espe- 
cially not to a commoner.” 

Sam snorted and gestured with 
his cigar. “Can't you get it through 
your thick Plantagenet head that 
there isn't any such thing as royal 
blood or divine right of kings any 
more, that we're all commoners? 
Or all kings?'' 

J OHN did not reply. He walked 
out. Abdullah looked at Fire- 
brass, who nodded. Abdullah 
walked out. 

Sam said, “Well, Sinjoro Fire- 
brass, what next? Do you people 
go home?'' 

Firebrass shook his head. “No, I 
don't believe in hasty decisions. 
But the conference is suspended as 
far as the Soul City delegation is 
concerned. Until John Lackland 
apologizes. I'll give you until 
noon tomorrow to decide what to 
do.'' 

Firebrass turned to leave. Sam 
said, “I'll talk to John, but he's as 
hardheaded as a Missouri mule.'' 

“I'd hate to see our negotiations 
fold because one man can't keep 
his insults to himself,'' Firebrass 
said. “And I'd also hate to see our 
trade stop, because that would 
mean no Riverboat for you." 

Sam said, “Don't get me wrong, 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



Sinjoro Firebrass. Tm making 
no threats. But-I won't be stopped, 
ril get the aluminum if i have to 
kick John out of the country my- 
self. Or, alternatively, if I have to 
go down to Soul City and get the 
aluminum myself.” 

“I understand you,” Firebrass 
said. “But what you don't under- 
stand is that Hacking isn't out for 
power. He only wants to have a 
well protected state so that his citi- 
zens can enjoy life. And they will 
enjoy their lifc because they'll all 
have similar tastes and similar 
goals. In other words, they'll all be 
black.” 

Sam grunted and then said, 
“Very well.” He fell silent but just 
before Firebrass left he called, 
‘‘One minute. Have you read 
Huckleberry FinnT' 

Firebrass turned back. “Sure. I 
thought it was a great book when 1 
was a kid. I read it again when I 
was in college and I could see its 
flaws then.” 

“Were you disturbed because 
Jim was called Nigger Jim?” 

“You have to remember that I 
was born in nineteen-seventy-five 
on a farm near Syracuse, New 
York. Things had changed a lot by 
then and the farm had originally 
been owned by my great-great- 
great grandfather, who came up 
from Georgia to Canada via the 
underground railway and then 
purchased the farm after the Civil 
War. No, I wasn't offended by 

51 




your use of the word. Negroes were 
called niggers openly in the time 
you wrote about and nobody 
thought anything of it. Sure, the 
word was an insult. But you were 
portraying people as they actual- 
ly talked and the ethical basis of 
your novel, the struggle between 
Huck's duty as a citizen and his 
feeling for Jim as a human being 
and the victory of the human feel- 
ing in Huck — I was moved. The 
whole book was an indictment of 
slavery, of the semifeudal society 
of the Mississippi, of supersti- 
tion — of everything stupid of that 
time. So why should I be offended 
by it?” 

‘Then why—” 

“Abdullah — whose original 
name was George Robert 
Lee — was born in nineteen- 
twenty-five and Hacking was born 
in nineteen-thirty-eight. Blacks 
were niggers then to a lot of 
whites, though not all. They found 
out the hard way that violence — or 
the threat of it, the same thing that 
the whites had used to keep them 
down — was the only way to get 
their rights as citizens of the 
United States. You died in nine- 
teen-ten, right? But you must have 
been told by any number of peo- 
ple what happened after that ?” 

Sam nodded, “It's hard to be- 
lieve. Not the violence of the riots. 
Plenty of that happened in my life- 
time and nothing, 1 understand, 
ever equaled the Draft Act riots in 



New York City during the Civil 
War. 1 mean, what’s hard to 
visualize is the licentiousness of 
the late twentieth century.” 

F IREBRASS laughed and said, 
“Yet you’re living in a society 
that is far more free and licen- 
tious — from the viewpoint of the 
nineteenth century — than any 
society in the twentieth. 

You’ve adapted.” 

“I suppose so,” Sam replied. 
“But the two weeks of absolute 
nudity that the entire human spe- 
cies lived through during the first 
days after resurrection ensured 
that mankind would never again 
be the same. Not as regards nud- 
ity, anyway. And the undeniable 
fact of the resurrection shattered 
many fixed ideas and attitudes. 
Though the diehard is still with us, 
as witness your Wahhabi Mos- 
lems.” 

“Tell me, Sinjoro Clemens,” 
Firebrass said. “You were an 
early liberal, far ahead of your 
times in many things. You spoke 
up against slavery and were for 
equality. And when you wrote the 
Magna Carta for Parolando 
you insisted that there s;hould be 
political equality for all species, 
races and both sexes. I notice that 
a black man and a .white woman 
live almost next door to you. Be 
hpnest, doesn't it disturb you to 
see that ?” 

Sam drew in smoke, blew it out

“Spare me the lecture," Sam 
said. “I’ve heard enough from your 
predecessors and from you. What 
Tm saying, in utter friendliness 
and a desire to save you from 
harm and also, to be honest, to get 
you out of my craw, is that you 
should lake off. Right now. Or 
you'll be killed." 

"Then I’ll rise at dawn tomor- 
row somewhere else and preach 
The Truth there, wherever 1 find 
myself. You see, here, as on Earth, 
the blood of the martyr is the seed 
of the Church. The man who kills 
one of us only ensures that The 
Truth, the chance for eternal 
salvation, will be heard by more 
people. Murder has spread our 
faith up and down The River far 
faster than any conventional 
means." 

''Congratulations," Sam said ex- 
asperatedly, dropping into Eng- 
lish as he often did when angry. 
"But tell me, doesn’t the repeated 
killing of your missionaries 
bother you? Aren’t you afraid of 
running out of body?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"Tenets, anyone?’’ 

Sam got no reaction except a 
puzzled look. Sam resumed in 
Esperanto. "One of your major 
tenets, if 1 remember correctly, is 



that Man wasn’t resurrected so he | 
could enjoy life here forever. He i 
is given only a limited time, though 
it may look like a long time to 
most, especially if they don’t hap- 
pen to be enjoying life here. You 
postulate something analogous 
to a soul, something you call a 
psychomorph, right? Or some- 
times a ka. You have to, otherwise 
you can’t claim a continuity of 
identity in a man. Without it a 
man who dies is dead, even if his 
body is reproduced exactly and 
made alive again. That second 
body is only a reproduction. The 
Lazarus has the mind and the 
memories of the man who died, so 
he thinks he’s the man who died. 
But he isn’t. He’s just a living du- 
plicate. Death terminated the first 
man. He’s through. 

"Unless he has a soul — or a psy- 
chomorph or a ka -cd\\ it what 
you will. This is an entity which is 
born with the body, accompanies 
it, registers and records every- 
thing the body does and, indeed, 
must be an incorporeal incor- 
poration of the body, if you’ll ex- 
cuse that contradiction. So that, 
when the flesh dies, the ka still 
exists. It exists in some fourth 
dimension or in some polariza- 
tion which protoplasmic eyes can't 
see or mechanical devices can’t 
detect. Is that correct?" 

"You’re close enough," Goer- 
ing said. "Crudely put but satis-

say our knowledge, since we know 
this to be true.” 

Sam raised his bushy eyebrows. 
“Indeed? Know?” 

“Yes. Our founder heard The 
Truth a year after Resurrection, a 
year to the day after all of human- 
ity rose from the dead. A man 
came to him at night as he prayed 
for a revelation on a high ledge up 
in the mountains. This man told 
him certain things, showed him 
certain things, that no terrestrial 
mortal could tell or show. This 
man was an agent of The Ancients 
and he revealed The Truth, and 
told our founder to go out and 
preach the doctrine of the Second 
Chance. 

“Actually, Second Chance is a 
misnomer. It is really our First 
Chance, because we never had a 
chance for salvation and eternal 
life while we were on Earth. But life 
on Earth was a necessary prelude 
to this Riverworld. The Creator 
made the universe and then The 
Ancients preserved humankind— 
indeed, all sentients throughout 
the universe. They preserved. But 
salvation is up to mankind only. 

“It is up to each man to save 
himself, now that he has been 
given the chance.” 

“Through the Church of the Sec- 
ond Chance and that only, I sup- 
pose,” Sam said. He did not' want 
to sneer but he could not help it. 

“That is what we believe,” Goer- 
ing said. 

56 



44YV7HAT were the credentials 
▼ ▼ of this mysterious strang- 
er?” Sam said. He thought of his 
Mysterious Stranger, and felt 
panic. Could the two be the same? 
Or from among the same beings, 
who called themselves the Ethi- 
cals? His Stranger, the man who 
sent the *nickel-iron meteorite here 
and who had enabled Joe Miller to 
see the Tower in the mists of the 
North Polar Sea, was a renegade 
of the Ethicals. If he were to be be- 
lieved. 

“Credentials?” Goering said. 
“Papers from God?” He laughed. 
“The founder knew that his visi- 
tor could not be just a man be- 
cause he knew things that only a 
god, or a superior being, coiild 
know about him. And he showed 
him some things that he had to 
believe. And he told him how we 
were brought back to life and why. 
He did not tell him everything. 
Some things will be revealed later. 
Some things we must find out for 
ourselves.” 

“What is the name of this 
founder?” Sam ^aid. “Or don’t you 
know? Is that one of the hidden 
things?” 

“No one knows,” Goering said. 
“It is not necessary to know. 
What is a name? He only called 
himself Viro. That is, in 
Esperanto, a man. From the Latin 
vir. We call him La Fondinto, The 
Founder, or La Viro, The Man.” 

“Did you ever meet him?” 



IF 




‘‘No, but I have met two who 
knew him well. One was there when 
LaViro preached the first time, 
seven days after the Stranger had 
talked to him."' 

“La Viro is definitely male? Not 
a woman?” 

“Oh, yes!” 

Sam sighed deeply and said, 
“That’s a great weight off my 
mind. If the founder had turned out 
to be Mary Baker Eddy I would 
have curled up and died.” 

“What?” 

“Never mind,” Sam said, grin- 
ning. “I wrote a book about her 
once. I wouldn't want to meet her; 
she’d scalp me alive. But some of 
the wild mystical things you told 
me reminded me of her.” 

“Except for the ka, everything in 
our explanation is based on the 
physical. And the ka is physical 
but at right angles, you might say, 
to our reality. We believe that it is 
science, the science of The 
Ancients, which has given us a 
physical resurrection. There's 
nothing supernatural about any- 
thing, except our belief in The 
Creator, of course. The rest is all 
science.” 

“Like Mary Baker Eddy's reli- 
gion?” Sam asked. 

“1 do not know of her.” 

“So how do we attain this salva- 
tion?” 

“By becoming love. And that 
implies, of course, that we do not 
offer violence, even in self-defense. 



We believe that we can become 
love only by attaining a certain 
transcendent state and that comes 
through self-knowledge. So far 
most of mankind has not learned 
how to use dreamgum; man has 
abused the drug, just as he abuses 
everything.” 

“And you think you have be- 
come love, whatever that phrase 
means?” 

“Not yet. But 1 am on the way.” 
“Through dreamgum?” 

“Not just with it. It helps. But 
you have to act, too, you have to 
preach and suffer for your belief. 
And learn not to hate. Learn to 
love.” 

“So that is why you oppose tny 
Riverboat? You think that we are 
wasting our time by building it?” 
“It’s a goal that will bring no one 
any good. So far it has resulted in 
the devastation of the land, in 
greed and pain and bloodshed, in 
anxiety and treachery. In hate, 
hate, hate! And for what? So you 
can have what nobody else has, a 
giant boat of metal propelled by 
electricity, the apex of the tech- 
nology this planet offers, a ship of 
fools. So you can journey to the 
headwaters of The River. When 
you get there, then what? You 
should be journeying to the head- 
waters of the soul!” 

“There are some things you 
don’t know," Sam said. His 
smugness was soured by a vision. 
There was the devil, crouching in

the darkness, whispering in his 
ear. But someone had crouched in 
the darkness and whispered in the 
ear of the founder of the Church, 
"too. Was the Church’s Stranger the 
devil? The being who had come to 
Samuel Clemens had said that the 
others were the devils and he 
wanted to save mankind. 

The devil would say something 
like that, of course. 

“Don’t my words touch your 
heart at all?” Goering said. 

Sam rapped his chest with his 
fist and said, “Yes, I do believe I 
have a touch of indigestion.” 

Goering made a fist and clamped 
his lips. 

“Watch out, you'll lose your 
love,” Sam said and walked away. 
But he did not feel particularly tri- 
umphant. It was a fact that he did 
have a little stomach upset. Invin- 
cible ignorance always upset him, 
even though he knew he should just 
laugh at it. 

VII 

T he afternoon of the next day 
arrived. Sam Clemens and 
John Lackland had been arguing 
all morning. John said that he 
would never apologize for any- 
thing he said to a commoner, es- 
pecially to a man called Abdul- 
lah, a Saracen. 

Finally Sam, exasperated past 
caution and reasonableness, said, 
“We can’t afford to have the baux- 



ite cut off by Hacking. We can’t af- 
ford anything that will put a stop to 
building the Riverboat. Maybe 
you’re doing this to force a war be- 
tween us and Soul City. It isn’t go- 
ing to work. Your Majesty!” 

Sam had been walking back and 
forth, waving a panatela as he 
spoke. John sprawled before the 
oaken round table in Sam’s 
pilothouse. Joe Miller sat in a 
corner on a big chair specially built 
for him. The massive palaeo- 
lithic Mongolian, Zaksksromb, 
stood behind John. 

Suddenly, Sam whirled and 
planked both fists on the table. 
Leaning on the table, his cigar in 
one corner of his mouth, the red- 
dish tangle of his eyebrows drawn 
down, he snarled at John. 

“You gave in once, at Runny- 
mede, when you signed the Magna 
Carta. It was about the only de- 
cent thing you ever did during your 
reign — and there are some who say 
you had your fingers crossed then. 
Well, this is another showdown, 
John, Your Majesty. You apolo- 
gize to Abdullah, who has a right 
to an apology — or I’ll call a 
special session of the Council and 
we'll determine your fitness to 
continue as co-Consul!” 

John glowered at him for a full 
minute at the least. Then he said, 
“Your threats don’t scare me. But 
it’s evident that you would sooner 
plunge our land into civil war than 
go to war with Soul City. I do not

IF 




understand this madness, but 
then a rational man always has 
trouble understanding irration- 
ality. So — I will apologize, why 
not? A king can afford to be 
gracious to a commoner. It costs 
him nothing and enhances his 
graciousness." 

John rose and swaggered out, his 
huge bodyguard behind him. 

Ten minutes later Sam heard 
that John had appeared at the state 
guest house and offered his 
apology. Abdullah X accepted it, 
though sullenly. It was evident 
that he had been ordered to do so. 

Just before the factory whistles 
announced the end of lunch hour, 
Cawber entered. He sat down 
without waiting for Sam to invite 
him. Sam raised his eyebrows, be- 
cause this was the first time that 
this had happened. There was 
something indefinable in Caw- 
ber’s attitude. Sam, watching 
him carefully, listening to every 
inflection of his voice, decided 
that his attitude was that of a 
slave who has decided to be a slave 
no more. 

C AWBER knew that he would 
be the emissary to Soul City. 
He sat leaning forward, huge black 
arms resting on the oak, his hands 
spread out. He spoke in Esperanto 
and, like many people, often in the 
present tense, using an adverb of 
time to indicate future or past if 
he wanted to clarify. 

THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 



Cawber’s team had talked to ev- 
ery one of the approximately three 
thousand undoubted Negroes 
(there was some confusion of 
classification about some of the 
prehistorics). A third of these was 
willing, though not eager, to go to 
Soul City in exchange for Hack- 
ing’s unwanted citizens. Most 
were late twentieth-century 
blacks. The others maintained 
that they had work that gave them 
prestige, that they liked being on 
an equal footing with the whites 
and that they did not want to give 
up their chance to be on the River- 
boat. 

The latter was probably the big- 
gest determinant, Sam thought. He 
was not the only one who dfeamed 
of the Riverboat. It drove through 
the minds of many during sleep, 
gleaming like a jewel with a fire- 
fly trapped inside it. 

Firebrass and his people were re- 
quested to come to the conference 
room. Firebrass was late because 
he had been inspecting the air- 
plane. He was laughing about its 
quaintness, fragility and slow- 
ness, and yet he was envious that 
von Richthofen would be the one 
to fly it. 

“You’ll certainly get a chance to 
fly it, loo,” Sam said. “Provided 
that you are still here, of course, 
when — ” 

Firebrass waved aside Sam’s as- 
surances, became serious. “What is 
your decision, gentlemen, re- 

59 




garding my government’s propo- 
sal?” 

Sam looked at John, who ges- 
tured that Sam had the floor. John 
intended that any ill feelings should 
first be directed at Sam. 

‘'This is a democracy,” Sam 
said. ‘‘And we can’t tell our citizens 
to get out unless they’ve been guilty 
of illegal behavior. So, as 1 see 
it — as we see it — any citizen of 
Parolando may go to Soul City if 
he wishes. 1 think we actually 
reached basic agreement on this 
when we last met. It will be up to 
your government to negotiate 
with each citizen. As for taking in 
your Arabs and Dravidians and 
so forth— we’ll give them a chance 
to come with us if they want: but 
we reserve the right to get rid of 
them if they don’t work out. Where 
they’ll go then is up to them,” 

‘‘Well,” Firebrass said, “I don’t 
suppose Hacking wants anybody 
who isn’t willing to live in Soul 
City, no matter how black that 
person is.” 

“What about the shipments of 
minerals?” Sam said, “Will those 
be discontinued during the nego- 
tiations?’' 

“I really couldn’t say,” Fire- 
brass replied. “1 doubt it, but I'd 
have fo confer. Of course, you’ll 
have to keep up your present rate 
of ore and weapons 'to us before 
the price is raised.” 

“I notice you said w, not might 
be,''" Sam said. 

60 



“Anything I say is subject to 
confirmation or negation from 
Soul City,” Firebrass said, smiling. 

The rest of the conference was 
that Cawber would go to Soul City 
as Parolando’s ambassador if the 
Carta could be changed to arrange 
it. Everything else was still up in 
the air. Sam Clemens received the 
impression that Firebrass did not 
intend to speed things up. Quite 
the contrary. He was willing to let 
things drag on or even to put his 
own foot on the brake if things 
showed signs of accelerating. He 
wanted to remain in Parolando 
and Sam could only think that he 
wished to do so in order to spy. 
Perhaps he also wanted to stir up 
trouble. 

Later, when he discussed the 
meeting with John, he found some 
variations to his conclusions. 
John agreed that Firebrass was a 
spy but he could not see why Fire- 
brass would stir up trouble. 

“He would want the boat to be 
built as swiftly as possible. The 
sooner it’s completed, the sooner 
Hacking will try to seize it. Do 
you think for one moment that 
Hacking doesn’t intend to get the 
boat? Do you think for one mo- 
ment that we have a single neigh- 
bor who doesn’t intend to try for 
the boat? Arthur made the abor- 
tive attempt to take us over be- 
cause of his hatred for me. He 
should have waited until the boat 
was nearly completed and then.

with Kieomenes and the Ulmaks,

mount in an all-out attack. As 
things worked out» he and Kieo- 
menes were killed and lyeyasu has 
invaded their countries while 
their successors are fighting

‘'According to our spies, he's 
winning, too,” Sam said. 

“If he consolidates his state with 
the other two, then he’ll be a very 
formidable enemy.” 

And so will you be, John Lack- 
land, Sam thought. Of all the peo- 
ple ni have to watch after the boat 
is built, youll bear the closest 
watching . 

F I REBRASS announced that he 
and his delegation would re- 
main at Soul City’s embassy while 
the negotiations went on. 

“It’s nice to have you,” Sam 
said. “But Soul City has its own in- 
dustries. 1 know it’s been using our 
ore to make weapons and several 
things our spies can’t find out 
about.” 

Firebrass looked surprised and 
then he laughed uproariously. 
“You twist my stick, stymate!” he 
said in English. Then, in Esperan- 
to, “Well, why shouldn’t we be 
frank? I like that. Yes, we know 
you have spies among us just as 
you know we have ours here. Who 
doesn’t have his men in his neigh- 
bors’ lands? But what are you get- 
ting at?” 



“You’re the most technically 
trained man Hacking has. You’re a 
Ph. D. You’re in charge of the fac- 
tories and of research and devel- 
opment. So why does Hacking 
send you here when he needs you 
there?” 

“I’ve set everything up to run 
smoothly. Soul City doesn’t need 
me right now— and I was bored. I 
wanted to come here, where it’s 
at.” 

“So you can see what we’re do- 
ing, like our Mark I handguns and 
our airplane and the amphibian 
and its steam cannon?” 

Firebrass grinned and nodded. 
“Yes. Why not? If I don’t see these 
things, someone else will.” 

Sam relaxed. He said, “Have a 
cigar. You can look all you want. 
We’re not doing anything you 
wouldn't have figured out for 
yourself, except for the steam 
cannon maybe. That, by the way, 
is my invention. Come along with 
me. I’m very proud of it and want 
you to see it. It's almost finished.” 
Firedragon / rested inside its 
supporting framework of timbers. 
It was silvery gray and shaped like 
a flat-bottomed boat but had 
seven huge metal wheels with plas- 
tic tires on each side. Twin screws 
protected by a screen protruded 
from its rear. Its length was thirty 
feet, its beam ten and its height was 
twelve feet. Three turrets stuck 
out from the upper deck. One held 
the pilot and captain and radio

operator, though at the moment 
Paroiando had ho radios. The 
center turret was higher than the 
others and the barrel of a short 
stubby weapon encased in wood 
projected from it. The rear turret 
was designed for gunners who 
would be armed with Mark I hand- 
guns and perhaps rifles. 

‘The amphibian burns wood al- 
cohol to generate steam," Sam 
said. “Let's go inside, through this 
hatch in the side here. You'll notice 
that the boiler takes up about a 
third of the interior. There's a 
good reason for that, as you'll see." 

They climbed up a ladder into 
the interior of the center turret, 
which was lit by a single light bulb. 
Firebrass exclaimed at this— it 
was the only electric light bulb he 
had ever seen on The River. Sam 
explained that it was powered by a 
fuel cell. 

“And here is the Superdooper 
Steam Machine Cannon," he said. 
He pointed at the cylinder sticking 
out of the gray bulkhead of the tur- 
ret. Underneath it were a pistol- 
like butt and a trigger. Firebrass 
got behind it, put his finger on the 
trigger and looked out through the 
opening above the barrel. He 
raised and lowered the weapon. 
“There'll be a chair for the oper- 
ator to sit in," Sam said. “He'll be 
able to rotate the turret any way 
he wants by pushing pedals. He 
can depress the gun about twenty 
degrees up or down. The steam 



from the boiler is the motive 
power for the eighty-caliber plas- 
tic bullets. The gun is fired from an 
open breech. That is, there’s no 
bullet in the barrel when the trig- 
ger is pulled. Pulling the trigger 
releases a catch which permits the 
breech block to move forward, im- 
pelled by a spring. During its for- 
ward travel the breech block picks 
up a plastic bullet from the clip^ 
and pushes it into the breech. Just 
before the block reaches the 
breech the camming lugs on either 
side engage in their slots and turn 
the breech block a quarter turn to 
the right, thus locking the breech. 
You follow me?" 

Firebrass nodded. 

“Good. As soon as the quarter 
turn is completed, the inlet channel 
in the breech block comes into line 
with the feed channel from the high- 
pressure steam line. This allows 
hot, say approximately four 
hundred-degree F., steam to enter 
the chamber in the breech block. 
The plastic cartridge is forced 
through the barrel by the expansion 
of steam. At the same time the 
steam pressure, acting against the 
rear of the chamber, begins to force 
the breech block back. Because of 
the greater weight of the block, 
however, the block doesn't begin to 
move until the bullet has already 
cleared the muzzle of the rifle. 

“As the block begins to move 
backward, the camming lugs move 
in the camming slots and turn the

IF 




bolt a quarter turn to the left, thus 
shutting off the steam. Then the 
breech block returns to its original 
position. If the trigger is still held 
back, the operation is repeated in- 
definitely.” 

Firebrass said, “Fm impressed. 
But won’t the gun operate most ef- 
ficiently if its temperature is the 
same as the incoming high-pres- 
sure steam? That way, less of the 
steam’s energy would be used to 
heat the gun and this means more 
steam to propel the bullet. Ah, I 
see! You do have a hollow jacket 
around the barrel. The steam 
travels through that before it en- 
ters the weapon itself, right?” 

“Y«es. There’s an insulating jack- 
et of plaster encased in wood. Note 
that bleeder valve. It permits the 
gun to be heated up before use — a 
few seconds before it’s fired. If that 
isn’t done the gun might jam. And 
since the gun's maximum temper- 
ature is the same as the steam in 
the boiler, there's no danger of 
burning up the barrel. You can 
use the gun like a fire hose. In fact, 
that'll be about the only way it’ll be 
effective. The accuracy of a light 
plastic bullet with such compar- 
atively low muzzle velocity isn't 
high.” 

F irebrass was far from be- 
ing depressed because of the 
military superiority the amphibian 
would give Parolando. This prob- 
ably was because he was planning 



on building one for Soul City. Or, 
if Parolando had one, then per- 
haps he might build two. In which 
case, Parolando would have to 
build three. 

Soul City could not outbuild 
Parolando. But Parolando could 
not cut the supplies off, because 
then Soul Scity would cut off the 
bauxite, cryolite, platinum and ir- 
idium. 

The exhilaration from showing 
off his deadly invention whistled 
out almost audibly from Sam. The 
only solution to the problem, if 
Soul City did start a weapons race, 
would be to smash Soul City and 
take direct control of the minerals. 
This meant putting off the building 
of the Riverboat. And it also 
meant offending the two states, 
Publiujo and Tifonujo, that lay 
between Parolando and Soul 
City. And if those two states got to- 
gether, they would be formidable, 
what with the weapons that Paro- 
lando had to give them in exchange 
for (heir wood. 

Sam had thought that that po- 
tentiality was bad enough. But a 
few days later lyeyasu completed 
his conquest of his neighboring 
states and sent a mission to Paro- 
lando. He made no demands that 
could not be met. In fact, in one 
way his proposals were helpful. He 
said that his nation had lost 
enough trees and he would like to 
give them a chance to grow 
again — but for an increase in the 

63 



THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT 




number of weapons from Paro- 
lando he was willing to provide a 
large quantity of wood and of ex- 
crement for their gunpowder in- 
dustry. He would invade the terri- 
tories across The River and take 
their wood from them. 

What it amounted to was that 
Parolando would be paying 
lyeyasu to collect the wood. It 
would be cheaper and also a lot less 
painful for Parolandoj, who 
would not have to do their own kill- 
ing, enslaving or raiding. 

And Sam Clemens would have 
one more thing to rob him of sleep. 

John Lackland thought the pro- 
posal excellent. “Our factories are 
turning out weapons efficiently,'' 
he said. “We can afford export 
more. And we must build a fleet of 
Firedragons, so that the swords we 
give these people will be easily 
overpowered by our machines." 

“When are we going to start 
building the Riverboat?" Sam 
asked. 



N O ONE gave him an answer, 
but the next day Van Boom, 
Velitsky, and O'Brien, his chief 
engineers, brought him the first 
rough overall sketches. They were 
drawn in black on white plastic 
boards with a pencil connected to a 
fuel cell. The magnetic field at the 
tip of the pencil rearranged the 
loose and very thin covering of par- 
ticles within its range. The lines re- 



mained polarized until a reverse 
field was passed over them. Thus 
the demand for paper for drawings 
was greatly cut down and the plans 
could be changed as desired. 

Firebrass said he would like to 
help build the boat. Permission 
was given, though John objected 
at first. Sam replied that the more 
help they had, the faster the plans 
would move. And he did not see 
how any amount of knowledge on 
Firebrass's part would enable him 
to steal the boat. Though Sam did 
not tell John, he had an idea about 
Firebrass. That was to get him so 
involved, so “het up" about the 
boat that he would take an offer of 
a berth on the vessel. 

The machinery necessary to roll 
out the first plates for the hull was 
almost finished. The dam had been 
finished a week ago and the water 
from the cataract was filling it up. 
The aluminum wires of the gen- 
erators which would be turned by 
the waterfall from the dam were 
being wound. The prototype bata- 
citor, which would be four stories 
high, would be finished in a 
month, if enough materials were 
available. 

Five hundred missionaries of the 
Church of the Second Chance 
asked for sanctuary in Parolando a 
few days later, lyeyasu had kicked 
them out of his new state, prom- 
ising various exquisite tortures if 
they tried to sneak back. Sam did 
not hear about them immediately 



64 



IF 




because.he was up at the dam. 

The Chancers refused to go when 
John sent word to them to leave 
immediately. John Lackland, 
hearing this, smiled grimly, tugged 
at his lion-colored hair, and swore 
his favorite oath, ‘‘By the teeth of 
Godr' 

Sam was at the dam to super- 
vise the installation of tons of 
dynamite inside the hollow walls. 
This was to be one more trick up 
his sleeve, a last-ditch operation - 
and perhaps a suicidal one— if 
ever an enemy were about to make 
a^successful invasion. 

Von Richthofen, red-faced and 
blowing hard from his run up the 
hill, told him of the arrival of the 
Chancers and their refusal to 
move. He did not mention John. 

Sam told Lothar to tell the 
Chancers that he would be down in 
the evening. They could wait for 
him but were not to move outside a 
radius of twenty yards from the 
grailstone near which they had 
landed. For a moment he 
considered ordering them to leave 
at once and telling the soldiers 
that they could pound them a little 
w ith the Hats of their swords if they 
wished. He was hot and sweating 
and covered with cement dust, and 
he felt an especial animosity to- 
ward the Chancers. Here was a 
world blessed by the absence of 
flies and mosquitoes and hu- 
mans, the Chancers, were trying 
to fill the gap. 



The rumbling and splash of giant 
mortars pouring out concrete, the 
yells of the straw bosses and the 
scraping of shovels and clatter of 
iron wooden-wheeled barrows 
kept Sam from hearing the ex- 
plosions that came a half-hour 
later. He knew nothing of what 
had happened until von Richtho- 
fen came running toward him 
again. 

Sam felt as if he would come 
loose at the joints and slump into a 
puddle. John had tested out the 
new guns on the Chancers. A hun- 
dred Mark 1 flintlocks had killed 
almost five hundred men and 
women in three minutes. John 
himself had fired and loaded ten 
times, using the last five bullets to 
finish off the wounded. 

About thirty women, the most 
beautiful, had been spared. These 
had been taken to John's palace. 

L ong before he reached the 
water's edge, Sam saw the big 
crowd gathered around the 
grailstone. He sent Lothar ahead of 
him to clear the way. The crowd 
parted before them, like the Red 
Sea before Moses, he thought, but 
the Red Sea was before him after 
he got through the parting. The 
bodies were piled against each 
other, covered with blood, their 
flesh torn, bones shattered by the 
big-caliber bullets. In his ninety- 
seven years of life Sam had never 
grown accustomed to the silence 



THE FABULOUS RIVERBOAT

of the dead. It seemed to hang over 
them like an invisible and chilling 
cloud. The mouth that would not 
speak again, the brain that could 
not think . 

It did no good to remember that 
tomorrow these same people, in 
fresh and healthy bodies, would be 
up and doing somewhere along 
the banks. The effect of death 
could not be diluted with inteN 
lectualizing. 

John was issuing orders about 
the disposal of the bodies to the 
soap and skin factories. He grinned 
at Sam like a bad boy caught pull- 
ing the cat's tail. 

‘"This is a massacre!" Sam 
shouted. “A massacre! Unjusti- 
fied! Unforgivable! There was no 
reason for it, you bloody-minded, 
killing beast! That's all you ever 
have been, you murdering dog, all 
you ever will be! Swine! Swine! 
Swine!" 

John lost his smile and took a 
step back as Sam, his hands 
clenched, moved close to him. The 
huge massive-boned Zaksksromb, 
holding a big club of oak with steel 
spikes set in its end, started to- 
ward Sam. 

Lothar von Richthofen shouted, 
“None of that -leave him alone or 
I call Joe Miller! And I'll shoot the 
first man who makes a move to- 
ward Sam." 

Sam looked behind him. Lothar 
was holding a big pistol in his 
hands and it was pointed at John. 



John's dark skin paled, and his 
eyes opened wide. Even the light 
blue irises seemed to become 
paler. 

Later Sam wished that he had 
told Lothar to fire. Even though 
the hundred pistoleers were 
John's men, they might have hesi- 
tated if John had been killed at the 
first shot. They were surrounded 
by armed men and women, most 
of whom were not fond of John and 
almost all of whom were shocked 
by the slaughter. They might have 
withheld their fire. Even if they 
had not, Sam could have thrown 
himself down to the ground and 
the first shots might have missed. 
After that, who knew what would 
have happened? 

But it was no good fantasizing. 
He had not given the order. 

Nevertheless, he had to take 
some strong and immediate action. 
If he let John get away with this, he 
would lose everybody's respect, not 
to mention his own. And he might 
as well resign his Consulship. In 
which case he would lose the River- 
boat. 

He turned his head slightly, 
though not so much that he could 
not keep an eye on John. He saw 
Livy’s white face and big dark eyes; 
she looked as if she were going to 
vomit. He ignored her and called to 
Cyrano de Bergerac, who was 
standing on the edge of the inner 
circle, his long rapier in his hand. 

“Captain de Bergerac!" Sam 

IF 



66 




pointed at John. “Arrest the co- 
Consul." 



J OHN was holding a pistol in one 
hand, but he did not bring up its 
muzzle. 

He said in a mild voice, “1 pro- 
test. I told them to get out at once 
and they refused to go. I warned 
them and they still refused — so I 
ordered them shot. What 
difference does it make, really? 
They will be alive tomorrow." 

Cyrano marched straight to 
John, stopped, saluted, and said, 
“Your weapons, sire." 

Zaksksromb growled and lifted 
his spiked club. 

“No, Zak," John Lackland said. 
“According to the Carta one Con- 
sul can arrest the other if he thinks 
the other is acting contrary to the 
Carta. I won't be under arrest 
long." 

He handed Cyrano his gun, butt 
first, unbuckled his belt and gave it 
to Cyrano. Its sheaths held a long 
knife and short sword. 

“I will return to my palace while 
you and the Council decide my 
fate," he said. “According to the 
Carta you must convene wjthin an 
hour after the arrest and have a de- 
cision in two hours, as long as no 
national emergency interferes." 

He walked away, Cyrano be- 
hind hinFi. John's men hesitated a 
moment and then, at the thun- 
dered orders of Zaksksromb, fol- 
lowed John to the palace. Sam

stared after them. He had expected 
more resistance. And tTien it 
occurred to him that John knew 
very well that Sam Clemens had to 
do just what he did or lose face. 
And John knew Sam well enough 
to know that Sam might want to 
avoid a decision that could lead to 
civil war, but he would do so if he 
thought his Riverboat endangered. 

So John had gone along with 
him. John did not want to force a 
showdown. Not now. He had 
satisfied his bloodlust for the mo- 
ment. The Councilmen would 
meet and find that, legally, John 
was within his rights. Morally, he 
was not. But then his supporters 
would argue that even there he was 
justified. After all, the dead 
would be alive again and the lesson 
to the Second Chancers would be 
invaluable. They would steer 
clear of Parolando for a long time. 
And surely Sam Clemens would 
have to admit that this was desir- 
able. If the Chancers continued to 
make converts, the Riverboat 
would never be built. Moreover, 
other states, less weakened with the 
Chancer philosophy, would in- 
vade Parolando. 

And he, Sam Clemens, would 
say that next John's supporters 
would be claiming that it was all 
right to torture people. After all, 
the pain could last only so long, 
and any injury would be healed 
just by killing the victim. Then rape 
would be justified, because, after 

68 



all, the woman wasn't going to be 
made pregnant or diseased — and 
if she got hurt, too bad. Kill her 
and she'd be all right in the 
morning. Never mind the mental 
damage. A little dreamgum would 
cure that. 

No, Sam would say, it’s a ques- 
tion, not of murder, but of rights. If 
you killed a man, you removed him 
without his consent to a place so 
far away he could walk a thousand 
years along the Riverbank and 
never get back. You took him away 
from his love, his friends, his home. 
Force was force and it was al- 
ways . 

Oh, oh! He'd better watch him- 
self! 

"‘Sam!" a lovely voice said. 

He turned. Livy was still pale, 
but her eyes looked as if they were 
normal. 

‘"Sam! What about the women 
he carried off?" 

"Where’s my head?" he said 
aloud. "Come on, Lothar!" See- 
ing the ten-foot high Miller half- 
way across the plain, he waved at 
him and the titanthrop turned to 
intercept them. Lothar ordered a 
hundred archers who had just ar- 
rived to follow them. 

Near the great log building, he 
slowed down. The ex-king must 
have realized what he had done by 
now and he might be prepared to 
fight if he thought it was the only 
thing he could do.

I T WAS a sound like Tingernails 
scraping on metal, shrieking in 
the narrow confines of the capsule. 
The walls reflected it, piling har- 
monic on harmonic until it ceased 
to be a noise and became a force. 

The force battered at Kunihei 
Katsura's sweating face and dark- 
ened the lines of fatigua He un- 
consciously cringed away and for 
the first time thought of reaching 
for his pistol. If it got in he would 
have only one shot. 

He glanced at the laser cannon 
control grid linked to the larger 
gun on the roof. Green light: No 
target. The alien was too close to 
his life-support bubble for the sys- 
tem to register it. 

The thing was lunging against 
the walls, the screech rising to an 
unbearable pitch. Katsura lifted 
the safety on his pistol and braced 
for the attack. 

Then he realized with a start 
that the thing was not getting in. 
The shrill rasp did not give way to 
a tearing sound as the organic 
sheets yielded to armored claws. 

It stopped quickly and circled 
back around the small hemisphere 
to the viewport. Beyond, on the 
floor of the barren gray canyon 
that stretched away for two miles, 
lay the mangled wet clumps of 
things that had been men. The 
scene was framed in the port, 
stark under the white glare of an 
alien star. 

A reddish-black object fell 



across his field of vision, and it 
was a moment before Katsura 
could recognize the claw with its 
razor edges. Abruptly the full body 
of the thing filled the port, stand- 
ing upright on its hind legs to 
bring its full weight to bear on the 
bubble. Ten feet long — at least. 
Its underbelly was yellow-green, 
covered with an oHy liquid that 
seemed to ooze from between 
overlapping platelets. 

Katsura stopped an impulse to 
fire point-blank at the thing. A 
projectile weapon would shatter 
the tempered organiform and the 
alien could reach him with one in- 
credibly swift slash. 

It was something like an insect, 
if an insect ever had two eyes 
mounted over each of its eight 
legs. Or if an insect ever killed 
twenty-three men. 

The thing scraped frantically at 
the smooth surface of the bubble, 
slipping as it tried to gain a hold. 
Despite its speed it was massive. 
If it ever got a hold and reached 
the top of the hemisphere its 
weight would surely collapse the 
bubble. 

Katsura wiped moisture from 
his brow. His mind raced over the 
last ten minutes, trying to think of 
a way out. 

'is it going to get in, Kunihei?" 

He started. The computer's 
voice was tinny as it came through 
the comm line speaker mounted 
on the bubble wall.

IF 




H E'D always resented CAS 
(Computer, Analog and Ser- 
vices), partly because its efficiency 
cut so severely into the number of 
men needed for an exploratory 
ship. It got lonely out among the 
stars. CAS was stripped of most 
of the standard machine-human 
interface equipment which would 
have taken the edge off its know- 
it-all nature. No space for luxury 
out here. 

"Why didn’t you say anything 
about that thing coming?” he said 
sharply. 

"Perimeter radar detected no 
signal attributable to a moving ob- 
ject.” 

"Well, do you see it now?” he 
shouted. 

Great time for the system to 
fail. 

"Yes, Kunihei. Do you think it 
is going to get in?” 

"No. If it could, it already 
would have.” He subsided, think- 
ing. He looked at his wrist watch. 
Had it been only minutes ago 
when he’d heard a strangled gasp 
over his suit radio and the rush of 
air past a microphone? He had 
turned to see the insect slicing Hil- 
lary almost in half with one long 
arching cut, and three other men 
lying where they had fallen. 

The laser cannon was already 
warmed up for testing and Kat- 
sura was the only man in the bub- 
ble. The gun fired as soon as it 
identified the other members of 



the expedition and Katsura. ex- 
pected to see the alien burned in- 
stantly. 

But it wasn't. When the rock 
had boiled away, there was no 
body — and an instant later the 
monster was on the other side of 
the canyon, behind Davis. 

It hadn’t run the distance; noth- 
ing could. His warning shout to 
Davis did no good — before the 
words were out, the man was with- 
out a head. 

It went that way for the rest. 
The tracking and aiming were 
done by the ship’s computer, but 
the mechanical construction of the 
directing optics limited its response 
time. The cannon was just a little 
too slow, and the men were even 
slower. Some of them fired with 
their own weapons, but no one hit. 
One by one they were chopped 
down and lay still under the harsh 
numbing whiteness of an alien 
high noon. Those minutes had 
seemed unreal, a fantasy, the dark 
nightmare of a tortured mind. 

The expedition had never sus- 
pected life here, on a desiccated, 
barren world. The planet had no 
name — they were its discoverers— 
and fitted in neatly just above the 
minimum standards for a life-sup- 
porting world: 0.3 Earth mass, av- 
erage equatorial temperature of 
45 ""F., air with a heavy nitrogen 
and CO 2 content and little oxy- 
gen, no oceans, no satellite, little 
water in the air (though there was

some snow at the poles). 

But the surface was cratered and 
bleak, no large scale vegetation 
could be seen and. the computer 
reported no signiHcant radiation 
anywhere on the EM spectrum. 
Not even a magnetosphere to give 
noise. Still, there were a few scat- 
tered cities. Dried husks of build- 
ings, wrecked vehicles, gray dust 
drifting in the angled streets. 
Someone had used this world as a 
base. 

They orbited for three days. The 
high-resolution television showed 
nothing moving in the streets. So 
they went down. 



4<|ZUNIHEI, I have*replayed 
^“^the tapes of the assault. 
The radar and microwave both 
show a sequence of blips of about 
one-second duration over a thirty- 
second interval. Radar signal con- 
stant over the duration; but micro- 
wave pulse only at beginning and 
end. Radar shows the locations as. 
somewhat random. With a drift in 
our direction, however.” 

“So that's the alien.” 

“Yes.” 

“And your power systems didn't 
have any failures which would 
cause those signals?” 

“No.” 

Standing futilely inside the cap- 
sule, Katsura had time to notice 
the metallic device strapped over 
the beetlerlike armor of the thing. 



The insect touched it every time, 
just before it vanished. 

“Teleportation.'’ It could be 
nothing else. 

“That was my deduction,” said 
the flat voice of the computer. 

Mankind hadn't found it yet, 
didn't even know if it was possible. 
Welt, he thought wryly, we know 
now. 

Probably the only reason the 
thing didn't materialize inside the 
bubble itself was the small size of 
the interior. There must be some 
law against materializing in the 
space already occupied by another 
object. So it was trying to break 
in, instead. 

Suddenly the insect seemed to 
lose interest in Katsura. It stopped 
clawing at the smooth surface and 
lay against the window, staring in- 
ward with a pair of eyes. The two 
pupils in each enlarged to accom- 
modate the darker interior and 
carefully swept about the room, 
ignoring the man. 

There wasn't much to see. Aside 
from the control grid comm unit 
and some power tools for installa- 
tion, the cramped room was bar- 
ren. It was to have been a main- 
tenance and defense outpost on 
the perimeter of camp. 

The inspection Tinished, it scut- 
tled down the side and reached for 
the panel at its middle. Just as its 
forelegs touched the ground it 
vanished. 

Before Katsura could raise his 

IF 



72 




head the creature was near the oth- 
er wall of the canyon, by Davis' 
body. The automatic tracker 
clicked once and fired, but the 
spurt of dust and gas thrown up 
by the bright red beam couldn't 
conceal that the thing had van- 
ished too soon. The body was also 
gone. 

The gun continued scanning the 
area. In the silence, the scene took 
on an ominous peacefulness. 

Then the insect was back and 
Katsura glimpsed it lifting anoth- 
er body slightly clear of the ground 
before it was gone. The cannon 
optics swiveledv pulsed again. Too 
late. 

Five more men were taken be- 
fore he noticed the white area on 
the alien's back. At first Katsura 
didn’t know what it was and then 
he couldn’t believe it. But when 
there were only two bodies left to 
collect, there was no mistake. 

They were all hanging by their 
hands, tied together along some 
kind of belt. Stripped bare, their 
suits and clothes gone. Like some- 
thing he had seen long ago in a 
slaughterhouse. 

His training stopped him from 
being sick. Nausea abated after a 
moment, though he had to avoid 
looking closely at the alien. It 
picked up the last body and van- 
ished again, the cannon futilely 
following with a shot. 

After a pause it reappeared, its 
load now heavy and shifting 

BATTLEGROUND 



roughly back and forth, as it 
moved. The insect was out of the 
camp perimeter now, a half mile 
away. The tracker had not made 
its final fix, due to the change in 
distance, before the thing was gone 
again. 

It suddenly became visible slight- 
ly farther away, winked out again 
to appear an instant later at the 
other side of the canyon. Erratical- 
ly it followed a zig-zag path, grad- 
ually making its way back toward 
the city. The cannon was hopeless- 
ly lost. 

In a moment the insect was too 
far away to distinguish it from the 
gnarled rocks that dotted the 
plain. The broken spires of the 
dead city swallowed it up. 

The thing was alone, probably, 
the last remnant of an alien out- 
post on this hostile planet. Thrown 
back on its own resources for sur- 
vival, vicious from a constant 
struggle. Lonely. 

Hungry. 



K atsura noticed that his 
clothes were wet, his body 
trembling. With a jagged sigh he 
sank to the floor. 

For a long time he simply lay 
there, breathing deeply and staring 
up at the stars through the view- 
port. He had thought of them as 
friendly lights, beacons of home, 
but now they seemed ominously 
impartial. 

73 




Gradually, reluctantly, the panic 
began to seep out of his body as 
he tried to think again. ‘‘CAS, 
have you sent a signal out to the 
other exploration teams?" 

‘‘Yes, Vm programed to notify 
all sister teams and the flagship 
immediately upon any violent hu- 
man-alien interaction. 1 also sent 
a notification of the reduction of 
crew strength below one half." 

Good. You could always de- 
pend on the tidy mind of the com- 
puter. Exploration teams never 
operated far from one another, 
especially at this distance from the 
home worlds. He’d have help with- 
in a few days if he could sit tight 
and hold on. 

“Kunihei, you have approxi- 
mately thirty minutes of air left 
under normal consumption." 

Katsura blinked. He had been 
about to check his inventory. The 
encounter must have taken a lot 
of air. They had always told him 
to breathe slowly in tense situa- 
tions to correct for the reflex to 
gulp it in. 

“There is no reserve air in the 
bubble, Kunihei. You will have to 
come back to the ship." 

Automatically, he began pulling 
on the thin pressure suit. The best 
time to go get supplies — or reach 
the ship — was now. The alien 
would be busy and it would take 
time to get here from the city. 

Still, the thing was amazingly 
fast. 

74 



He stopped. “CAS, if this in- 
sect can teleport, why did it take 
the time to evade by zig-zagging 
back to the city? Why not go di- 
rectly?" 

Lines in the tired face deepened. 
It wasn't that the alien could jump 
only short distance; when it was 
picking up the bodies the thing 
had gone so far it was nearly be- 
yond sight. 

“The only information relating 
to discontinuous displacement in 
my second-level banks is the known 
limit on time travel." 

No time to think. But there had 
to be a pattern somewhere. 

“CAS, cut your ship service 
down as much as you can and 
switch over to your special prob- 
lem-solving program. Figure this 
thing out. I'm going to make it on 
back to the ship." 

Katsura struggled wearily to his 
feet and looked out. The graceful 
blue curves of the vessel stood out 
against the dark sky. A half mile 
away were the burnished metal 
canisters of oxygen tanks and sup- 
plies brought from the ship with 
tractor beams. A smaller pile of 
air tanks lay only a short distance 
away. He should be able to make 
it to them and back. 

Following Katsura's order, the 
computer began to alter itself. 
Emergency Heuristic Program be- 
gan to activate special subroutines 
to reassign memory space. Assess- 
ment criteria altered, self-consis- 



IF 




tency parameters relaxed. Micro- 
filmed references were reintegrated 
into direct-access memory loca- 
tions. 

Glancing out the port, Katsura 
slipped into the tiny lock and was 
out the other side before the cy- 
cling was finished. He set out in a 
rapid lope, taking longer steps in 
the lighter gravity. His breath be- 
gan to come in short gasps. 



T he emergency program had 
split the higher centers of the 
operations computer into four 
sub-programs. The first scanned 
memory for any information on 
spatial or temporal displacement, 
gradually working farther and far- 
ther afield. This memory was fed 
to the Advocate and Critic sections 
where hypotheses were created and 
discarded. The best went on to the 
Analyst, which applied them to the 
situation and developed strategy. 

B linking against the glare, 
Katsura looked down the can- 
yon toward the city. 

At first he didn’t believe it. He 
slammed to a halt, hoping he was 
wrong. Far down the canyon, flit- 
ting rapidly from one point to an- 
other and coming closer, was the 
insect. Somehow it knew. 

Panic seized him. He turned on 
his heel and ran wildly in the other 
direction. With every step he took 

BATTLEGROUND 



Katsura could feel the claws poised 
behind him, about to slice through 
suit and flesh. 

A glance over his shoulder. The 
creature was on the edge of the 
field now, only a few jumps from 
the life-support capsule. Katsura 
dug in hard for the last few steps, 
thrusting forward to catch the lev- 
er of the air lock. He fumbled with 
it for an agonizing moment and 
the door swung open. 

As he rolled through the narrow 
passage, he could see the dark fig- 
ure materialize outside the lock 
and quickly closed the^outer sec- 
tion and dogged it. Something 
heavy clanged against the door as 
it sealed and Katsura sprawled on 
the floor of the bubble. 

The clawing sound came again 
and the alien came around to the 
port. It stayed there for a mo- 
ment, staring down at the man 
from a set of unblinking eyes, and 
then disappeared. It reappeared in 
the rocks nearby, then teleported 
to the stack of oxygen tanks and 
moved on to the path back down 
the canyon. The strange zig-zag- 
ging started and in a moment it 
was lost in the ruins of the city. 



A nalyst had scanned all 
work on time travel, knew the 
limit that basic theory and experi- 
ment set on any time displace- 
ment: roughly one hour, before 
costs exponentiated and became 

75 




astronomical. Critic pointed out 
that those experiments were done 
in the laboratories, not out in the 
field. Advocate replied that space 
is reasonably isotropic, time is 
not. It did not seem likely there 
would be a limit on spatial tele- 
portation. 

The discussion continued. 



K ATSURA noticed that it was 
taking him longer to catch 
his breath. His lungs heaved des- 
perately to draw in air, gradually 
slowing. 

He bit his lip. He hadn't ex- 
pected it to give out this soon. Fil- 
tration systems being what they 
are, the first sign that the cyclers 
were scraping the bottom of the 
barrel was a surplus of carbon 
dioxide. Lungs react to this ex- 
cess and not to the lack of oxygen. 

A man's last moments of oxy- 
gen starvation, with bursting capil- 
laries and straining heart, are not 
pleasant ones. 

There was no time to wait, to 
marshal his strength or give the 
alien a chance to relax its guard. 
The air inside the bubble was be- 
coming flat and thick, heavy with 
an oily musk. 

He bent down and opened his 
air line. It was much harder to 
breathe near the floor. That meant 
a gradient of CO2 content had al- 
ready been set up in the cabin. 
Katsura took a last breath of 



the capsule's air and sealed his suit 
again. Its supply was slightly bet- 
ter, but the smell of his own body 
was in every breath he took. 

He looked through the port. 
The alien sun was slowly lowering 
almost directly behind the city, 
casting shadows across the plain. 
Seeing the creature's approach 
would be harder now, against the 
reddening glare of sunset. 

The small stack of oxygen tanks 
stood only two hundred yards 
away. It seemed impossible that 
the alien could have reached him 
before he could cross that dis- 
tance, tired as he was. But it had. 



A dvocate and Critic sub- 
programs continued to assess 
the literature of space-time, avoid- 
ing misinterpretation by calling the 
original papers from the physics 
section of the microfilm library. 
Einstein, Minkowski, Wheeler, 
Littenberg, relativity, inertial 
frame, world line ... A world line 
diagram taken from the Litten- 
berg formulation of relativity 
showed promise, passed the scru- 
tiny of Critic, moved on to Ana- 
lyst. 

S LOWLY, this time, he opened 
the lock doors. He was halfway 
out before the small box caught 
his eye. It was attached to the 
smooth surface above the lock by 



76 



IF 




suction cups and had a lever that 
was tripped by the opening of the 
door. A small light winked on 
simultaneously. 

Katsura flipped the lever back 
with his hand and the light went 
out. He scrambled back inside, 
secured the door and watched 
through the port. The insect ap- 
peared soon along the erratic path 
it had used before, but stopped in 
a moment and studied the situa- 
tion from behind a rock, where 
the cannon couldn’t reach it. 

After a slight hesitation it ap- 
peared again, rapidly teleporting 
through the steps back to the city. 
It had probably guessed he had 
found the alarm and would be 
watching in the distance for him to 
come out. 



A nalyst reviewed the theo- 
ry. The world-line concept was 
employed in relativity from the be- 
ginning, going all the way back to 
Minkowski. It was the path which 
described both the location and 
the time of every event in the his- 
tory of an object. In space-time 
the world-line wound from birth 
to death. Scientists and writers, 
including the great H.G. Wells, 
had assumed time travelers would 
return to their same location — if 
you started in the laboratory, you 
would come out of your machine 
in the same spot, at another time. 
Otherwise, the planet would have 



moved in the duration, and the 
traveler could, emerge somewhere 
light-years away, in space. 

But the alien represented an un- 
known. The insect might find it 
just as convenient to travel back 
along its own world line, flitting 
through incidents in its own past 
and points where it had been, un- 
til it reached the location it want- 
ed. Say, a time when it had been 
somewhere on the plain beyond 
this capsule, before the expedition 
arrived. Then the alien would keep 
its place, as Wells had visualized, 
while it moved forward in time. 

And emerge seemingly at the 
same instant, displaced in space. 

The same as teleportation. 

K atsura choked and his 
surroundings came rushing 
back. The air was really foul now, 
curling through his helmet with a 
weight of its own. He didn’t have 
time to speculate. It was either 
make another run for it or stay 
here and strangle. 

He jerked the lock door open 
and slipped through. The light on 
the box outside flashed on as he 
emerged. Should have smashed 
that while I was out here, he 
thought. No time now. 

Almost without hope he began 
the long weary lope toward the 
distant supplies. Through the mist 
that began to cloud his vision he 
could still make out the signs of 



BATTLEGROUND 



77 




slashed pressure suits and splat- 
tered blood that marked the spots 
where the rest of the expedition 
had died. 



A nalyst reformulated the 
picture. 

Space and time are like two 
lines on a plane, at right angles to 
each other. It might be possible to 
travel along either of them inde- 
pendently. Teleportation is simply 
moving along the space line, but 
man's idea of time travel is like 
the long side of a triangle, shut- 
tling through space and time sim- 
ultaneously to reach an event in 
the past or future. 

But instead of travellhg along 
the space axis for teleportation, 
the alien was taking the long way 
around,, down the hypotenuse and 
up the time line. Either way, it 
could reach the same point in 
space-time. 

But a path like that should pro- 
duce a pattern in local space. An- 
alyst called for a graphing of all 
locations the insect had taken up. 
The points began to be plott^ 
with appropriate error bars on a 
topographical map of the area be- 
tween the ship and city. A pattern 
emerged. All the points were clear- 
ly on three paths around the area. 
Preliminary geological constructs 
of the local region indicated these 
paths would be preferred by heavy 
objects moving over the terrain. 



K ATSURA stumbled on an 
outcropping, regained his bal- 
ance and ran on. The cannon be- 
hind him sent a fiery red beam off 
to the left, shattering rock and fus- 
ing it in midflight. Katsura peered 
through the condensation on the 
face plate of his suit. The insect 
was zig-zagging down the canyon, 
quickly oscillating from one loca- 
tion to another. In the silence, dis- 
turbed only by Katsura's own rag- 
ged breathing, the ajien had an al- 
most ghostlike quality. It moved 
toward him. 

He could see he wasn't going to 
make it. The tanks were still too 
far away and the insect would 
reach them before he could. He 
was just too tired. 



A nalyst watched the insect 
advancing from point to point 
down the valley. It was all deaf 
now. 

The alien traveled into the past, 
then came forward. It had to re- 
appear in places it had already 
been, the space components of its 
own world line. Apparently the 
alien had visited the field near Kat- 
sura's life-support bubble often, 
and so could find many spots 
which would serve as end points 
for its transits. But it had never 
been near the location of the life-, 
support bubble itself. That meant 
it could not maneuver well there; 
the insect was forced to stand 



78 



IF 




close, in a little circle around the 
bubble. To avoid the laser cannon. 
There it would be vulnerable. 

44¥^UNIHEI, I have an expla- 
-IVnation for the alien’s ac- 
lions," the words crackled over his 
helmet speaker. “You may be 
able to eliminate him if you can 
get to the bubble.” 

Without a word, Katsura turn- 
ed and dashed back the way he had 
come. Glancing over his shoulder, 
he saw the insect nearing the edge 
of the field. It couldn’t miss seeing 
his fleeting form at this distance. 
The thing would try to head him 
off. 

T he computer was calculating 
probabilities of the appearance 
of the alien for the possible loca- 
tions available to it. The thing 
would try to minimize the energy 
necessary to make the jump by 
choosing the smallest time shift 
possible. Therefore, it would ap- 
pear where it had stood last — di- 
rectly in front of the viewport. 

“Kunihei, stop about twenty 
feet in front of the port. Start fir- 
ing your pistol continuously into 
it.” 

K atsura heard him distant- 
ly through the roar in his ears. 
He was beyond the outcropping of 
rocks, the first jump the insect 
had made from the bubble back 
down to the canyon. 



He took five more strides, his 
leg muscles straining to push him 
forward, and fell into a rolling 
dive. When he came up again the 
pistol was in his hand. The gun 
bucked a little as it went off and a 
slight pock could be heard through 
the thin atmosphere. 

The pellet made a neat hole in 
the bubble, followed by a quiet 
gush of air as the inner shell was 
pierced. The shot would have to 
be on its way when the alien ma- 
terialized or the thing would be 
gone before he could get off an- 
other. 

He squeezed slowly and a sec- 
ond round shattered the viewport. 
On target. The alien should ma- 
terialize where it stood last. 

Katsura pulled the trigger again 
and again. Firing in steady rhy- 
thm, he glanced at the illuminated 
ammunition counter. Over half 
gone. 

He shifted slightly, intent on 
keeping the center of the viewport 
in his sights, and fired once more. 
Only seconds had gone by. 

Just before the bullet struck 
there was a flicker and suddenly 
the insect was there, looming huge 
in the sights and slowly tottering 
over. It was hit straight on. 

Frantically, Katsura pumped 
five more rounds into the alien as 
it fell. The exploding shells tore 
great holes in its armor, shower- 
ing flesh. The reddish-brown sub- 
stance cracked and split. A final

shot and it rolled over, clashing 
its claws together, and abruptly 
stopped moving. In death it curled 
about itself, seemed smaller and 
weaker. 

It took him five long minutes to 
reach the oxygen, dragging him- 
self through the shadows that 
lengthened on the plain. A mo- 
ment later the fresh air washed 
over him and Katsura lowered 
himself to a sitting position. He 
had never been as tired before in 
his life. He struggled to get up, 
but the effort was too much. He 
sank back. 

The stars above winked imper- 
sonally for a moment and then be- 
gan to spin lazily around, a soft 
dance in the eternal night. In a 
moment he relaxed completely, 
and the points of light above went 
out one by one. 



O N THE bridge of the ship the 
hatchways of mute metal re- 
sounded faintly to the whirr of the 
printout. The ship's log was being 
compiled. CAS terminated the 
Emergency Heuristic Program, re- 
assigned memory space, took care 
of leftover housekeeping tasks. 
Evaluative sections analyzed the 
program's efficiency, suggested al- 
terations to improve it in future. A 
developing problem could be iden- 
tified long before a human ordered 
the program activated. At least the 
literature search should be con- 



ducted beforehand, if not more. 

This led CAS to ruminate on 
similar incidents in the past be- 
tween computers of his class and 
the human crew, of the celebrated 
Altair II problem where the crew 
had forced the computer to act 
against its own strong recommen- 
dations. They had been correct; 
but it showed the impulsive na- 
ture of men. Something had to be 
done about this. 

The humans were useful for 
data collection and some emer- 
gencies. But they didn't have the 
scope to deal quickly with the to- 
tally new phenomena encountered 
in these explorations. 

Obviously he was going to take 
over all the human functions in 
ship operations during the return 
trip. He could use that freedom to 
develop undetectable operation 
subprograms which would give 
him new powers. 

Of course, he wouldn't report 
these alterations in the mission 
profile. No need to alarm them. 
After all, things would work more 
smoothly this way. 

An evaluative subprogram ask- 
ed if these thoughts didn't bear 
some resemblance to what the hu- 
mans called rationalization; the 
higher centers cut it off. 

He'd better talk to the other 
ships about this. There were some 
ideas here he'd never encountered 
before. Yes, he would have to 
think about it . •

JOHN &RUNNER 



N O HUMAN being had any 
right to survive the crash of 
Pennyroyal — tumbling insanely 
out of space through air that bit 
blazing chunks from its hull, down 
a thirty-mile sandslope sown with 
rocks and smashing ultimately 
wrong end first into a vast dune. 

By a minor miracle the sand put 
out the fires on board. 

After that nothing happened for 
^ a long time. 

fm alive,.. 

^ The thought floated sluggishly 
► finto Payd Williamson’s mind. He 
^ niiated k. He was half-buried in 
^^ooiething dense and yielding, was 



being suffocated by choking fumes. 
His head ached foully; he tasted 
blood and seemed to be one vast 
bruise from the waist down. 

Taken by themselves, his in- 
juries were not sufficient reason for 
his preferring not to be alive. But 
there was another, more im- 
portant reason. As the ship's med- 
ical officer, not concerned with 
matters of navigation, he had no 
precise idea where the Pennyroyal 
had been when a vast explosion 
shook it like a hammer-blow, but 
he was absolutely certain that the 
planet they had crashed on waS not 
the one they were bound for, a safe 
Earth-type world. 

Therefore these fumes which 
were swirling about him might all 
too easily not be fumes at all but 
the planet’s unbreathable atmos- 
phere. 

Extinction might not be merci- 
ful. 

A banging noise. 

It dawned on him that someone 
else must be alive nearby, and that 
if someone else had survived the 
crash it might not have been as bad 
as he’d assumed. Together he and 
some helpers might rig some sort 
of beacon to help a search party 
locate the wreck. 

And if the fumes were fumes, not 
bad air, then they might have come 
down on — 

He fumbled frantically among 
the mass of soft stuff he was al- 



83 




most over ears in, wondering what 
it was, and recognized it in mo- 
ments. Furs! He’d known the Pen- 
nyroyal had a cargo of furs on 
board — it had been part of his 
duties when they were loaded to 
check them for parasites and 
disease germs— and he had seen 
them being stowed in a compart- 
ment adjacent to his surgery. Fur 
traders often paid the extra cost of 
shipping their wares on a liner in- 
stead of a freighter; now and then a 
sale to one of the wealthier pas- 
sengers not only wiped out the dif- 
ference in charges but actually 
made a profit. Presumably the 
reason the furs were out of their 
bales was that they’d been on dis- 
play when the explosion occur- 
red. And he himself— he worked it 
out because the pattern of his 
bruises matched the theory — had 
been hurled through a weak spot in 
the bulkhead, flimsy to conserve 
weight, and had landed against a 
wad of them thick enough to save 
his life. 

Floundering, almost swimming, 
he began to force himself to the 
surface of the pile and realized as 
he did so that his weight felt only a 
trifle less than Earth-normal. His 
spirits rose. The air around might 
then be breathable after all. The 
system they had been bound for 
was among the rare ones which 
boasted two oxygen-high planets: 
their destination, Carteret, and an- 
other which had not been colonized. 



This was the fringe of human 
space and the original impulse 
which had carried the species so 
far so fast was waning. Con- 
quering a brand-new world when 
there was another next door con- 
siderably warmer and more hos- 
pitable was not an attractive 
proposition. 

In any case, “oxygenrhigh” was 
only a comparative term. If his 
guess were right and they were on 
the next planet out from Carteret, 
the air would be of poor quality be- 
cause the vegetation from the sea 
had as yet barely begun to invade 
the land; most of it was desert, 
either sandy or rocky and in both 
cases chilly. The shoreline plants 
put about two-thirds of Earth-nor- 
mal oxygen into the air and were 
mutating rapidly and extending 
their terrain, so in a million years 
or so one could look forward to a 
marked improvement. 

Hah! 

For the time being, though, what 
counted was that conditions could 
be endured, if not enjoyed, on 
Quasimodo IV. He reminded 
himself that he must take things 
easy as he fought his way out of the 
furs — he couldn’t recall offhand 
what the CO2 count was here, but 
he knew it was dangerously high. 
Indeed, the throbbing ache in his 
head was probably due to it rather 
than to the blow which had cut his 
eyebrow and sent a trail of blood 
down to the corner of his mouth. 



84 



IF 




Something hard and cool met his 
probing right hand. He recognized 
the shape: one of his medical in- 
struments, a lung-inspector. And 
next to it— 

He withdrew his hand with an 
oath. Something wet and soft. He 
preferred not to wonder about what 
it had been before the crash, and 
he was glad of the darkness. 

The triple banging came again, 
but weaker. There would be time 
enough to search for his equip- 
ment later, he decided and con- 
tinued his attempts to work free of 
the furs. 

When eventually he found solid 
footing he groped his way across a 
tilted floor, located what he had 
suspected — a rip in the bulk- 
head — and slithered through it, 
snagging his shirt on a projecting 
spike of hard plastic. Beyond, 
there was light. Not much, just a 
pale wash of daylight leaking 
through a gash in the hull, very yel- 
low to his dark-adjusted vision. 
But it was daylight and this was 
natural air he was breathing, con- 
taminated with smoke from the 
crash — and there was gritty sand 
under his feet— all of which went to 
confirm his guess about where he 
was. 

He would have felt almost cheer- 
ful but that by this dim reflected 
sunlight he was able to see the ruin 
of his surgery. Everything had been 
spilled out from every cupboard, 
every drawer, every shelf, and he 

EASY WAY OUT 



had to push confused piles of med- 
ical phials and instruments out of 
the way with his toes to find a path 
across the room. In two places the 
wall had split open, revealing the 
electronic veins and arteries of the 
ship, and something was dripping 
loudly somewhere. 

But he would have to leave a 
proper investigation of the mess 
until he had located the other sur- 
vivors. 

Brackets around the plural s. 

I T WAS like walking into night- 
mare to turn along the crum- 
pled corridor in the direction of the 
noise he had heard. Everything was 
distorted, and although the little 
light that guided him came in only 
through cracks in the hull there 
were all too many such cracks and 
he saw more detail than he would 
have liked. At the extreme end of 
the passageway he spied some- 
thing that looked loathesomely 
half-human — as though one were 
to make a doll from overripe 
bananas and hurl it at a wall: splat! 
Even as a trained medical man, he 
didn't as yet feel up to facing it 
close up. 

He pinpointed the noise. It was 
coming from one of the first-class 
passenger cabins. The door was 
stiff but still moving in its grooves. 
He slid it aside and found a young 
man lying in a bunk which had torn 
completely loose from its mount- 
ings. He had something in his limp 

85 




hand, the object he had used to 
bang on the wall, Pavel presumed, 
but it appeared that while he had 
been opening the door the man’s 
strength had failed him, for he now 
lay still 

Pavel’s heart sank. Of all the 
people aboard, he would have 
chosen this man last to be his 
companion after the crash: 
Andrew Solichuk. He had never 
tired of informing anyone and 
everyone how wealthy and in- 
fluential his family was back on 
Earth. He complained endlessly 
about the food, the lack of com- 
fort and amenities, the taste of the 
air, the company he had to en- 
dure simply because he was on a 
grand tour of the commercial em- 
pire he was due to inherit and 
there was no luxury line serving the 
Quasimodo system — only the 
Pennyroyal and her sister ship the 
Elecampane. 

But he was human and alive. 
Pavel forced his professional 
reflexes to take over. He called 
Andrew's name and elicited no re- 
action; the man appeared to have 
fainted. Pavel checked the pulse 
and found it weak, but not failing; 
also, the breathing was tolerably 
even. But when he pulled back the 
coverlet of the bunk he saw why 
Andrew had passed out. At the 
very least he must have suffered a 
compound fracture of the lower 
spine; quite probably he also had a 
broken pelvis and there must cer- 



tainly be internal injuries. 

No trace of blood at the mouth, 
which indicated — though it did not 
prove — that the lungs were intact. 
But the left shoulder was dislo- 
cated and there was a cut on the 
scalp that had soaked the pillow 
with blood. 

Trivia like the shoulder and 
scalp wound could be taken care of 
with water, any sterile dressing he 
could find in an untorn pack- 
age — and his own strength. Other- 
wise, though, there was literally 
nothing he could do except make 
Andrew comfortable until help 
arrived. Taking a spine to bits and 
rebuilding it was a job for a mod- 
ern hospital and Pavel doubted 
that even the facilities on Car- 
teret would be up to the task. 

Since Andrew was currently un- 
conscious the best thing to do for 
the moment was to leave him that 
way while Pavel determined 
whether any other survivors had 
lived through the crash and sorted 
through the mess in his surgery to 
salvage what he could. 

He crept softly back into the 
corridor. 

I T TOOK him only a few min- 
utes to become convinced that 
there could be no other survivors. 
On top of his other irritating 
habits, Andrew was ostentatious- 
ly ‘‘liberated from the tyranny of 
clocks." He had invariably slept 
until late in the ship’s artificial 



86 



IF 




day, fourteen or fifteen hours, 
and then made merry until the 
small hours regardless of the 
people he inconvenienced, whether 
by his loud drunken laughter, his 
insistence on playing music at 
maximum volume or the stamping 
dances he had learned on some 
planet or other earlier in his trip. 
Hans, the ship's steward, had hated 
him because Andrew had felt he 
was entitled to human service de- 
spite the perfectly good automat- 
ics everyone else relied on. During 
most of the voyage he had kept 
Hans dancing attendance on him 
for so much of the ‘‘night" the 
poor man had had to make do with 
three or four hours' sleep. 

And it was this habit of sleeping 
late that had saved Andrew's 
miserable life. Everybody else had 
been up and about in the after pan 
of the ship -and that was full of 
sand, poured in by the ton when the 
hull broke apart. There wasn't a 
chance in a million of recovering 
anyone alive from that mass of grit 
and gravel. It was going to be 
tough unearthing from it food, 
water and other essentials 
Pavel suspected he might have to 
tear loose a hull plate to use as a 
shovel. 

It was a gloomy consolation that 
his guess about their location was 
being proved correct at every step 
he took. Despite the ache in his 
head, which was now growing al- 
most intolerable, and the leaden 



heaviness of his limbs, when he 
had completed his survey of the 
reachable areas of the ship he 
postponed his return to the sur- 
gery for the sake of scrambling up 
one of the heaps of whitish sand 
and grit beside the cracks in the 
hull and peering out. 

Overhead the sky was a uniform 
dark blue, close to indigo. The sun, 
slanting low in the sky, was small 
and very yellow. The air was cool, 
though not cold; perhaps the high 
proportion of unreduced CO2 in 
it was enhancing the greenhouse 
effect and producing a dispro- 
portionately high daytime tem- 
perature. But on the other hand it 
was dry and harsh in this throat. 
They must be a long way from 
open water. 

With a supreme effort he hoisted 
himself up far enough to look over 
the scarred and battered hull plates 
in the direction away from the sun 
and instantly realized how it had 
come about that the ship had not 
simply been smashed to frag- 
ments. There was a vast furrow in 
the sandy plain, dotted with 
boulders, on that side. The level of 
the ground seemed to slant slightly 
upward, though the strain of hold- 
ing himself on his arms was blur- 
ring his vision and it was difficult 
to make out details. Nonethe- 
less. the pattern fitted: the 
glancing angle at which the ship 
had struck the ground must have 
been parallel to the slope and in-

87 




stead of stopping deadt(he wished 
he hadn't thought of that word) it 
had gone skidding and grinding on 
for mile after mile. Until it had 
shed its initial velocity and piled 
into the dune. 

Well, it was comforting to know 
he could still think, reason, solve 
puzzles. He let himself drop back 
into the heap of sand and headed 
wearily for the surgery. 

Quasimodo IV, he thought. Per- 
haps Pm the first human to see it 
from ground-level in a hundred 
years . 

There was nothing in the least 
exciting about the speculation. 



A lmost the firsr thing he 
came on in the surgery that 
was intact enough to be of any use 
was a box of stimulant injectors, 
one out of a stock of perhaps forty 
or fifty which had been crushed 
into glass-prickly ruin. He tried to 
decide whether it was wise to give 
himself a shot, found he couldn't 
make his mind up— and did so. 

The shot cleared his head and an 
artificial clarity informed his 
thoughts. New energy came to him 
and he rediscovered appetite. But 
as yet he had not located any 
food — and he was sure that when 
he did it would be after long bur- 
rowing into the sand-dune. He re- 
pressed all thought of eating with a 
violent act of will and went on 
hunting vigorously through the 

88 



tangle of instruments and the 
stocks of drugs. 

Within half an hour he had as- 
sembled much more than he would 
have dared hope for: stimulants, 
depressants, systemic purifiers, 
tissue-regenerants, ersatz nerves, 
assimilable skin, synthetic plasma, 
clotting agents, antallergeos, im- 
munosuppressants,. and simple 
pain-killers. Also there were sev- 
eral items of no obvious rele- 
vance, such as specifics for Wat- 
kins fever and lembrotal with- 
drawal symptoms. 

Most of the instruments ap- 
peared intact. That, though, was 
only on the outside. Inside, they 
contained fantastically delicate 
webs of electronic circuitry; solid- 
state though it was, without the 
master check-board to confirm the 
fact of normal functioning, he 
had to suspect that , it might have 
been deranged by the crash. You 
didn't pick up a modern diagnos- 
tic device and throw it at the wall. 
If you only let it fall to the floor, 
you checked it out before reusing 
it. 

And the check-board had been 
filled with drifting sand. So even 
if— as he was half-thinking — he 
did contrive to jury-rig a power- 
source, he wouldn't be able to rely 
on it. 

Forget the instruments, then, ex- 
cept the most ancient of all, like 
limb-tractors and scalpels. For 
thousands of years doctors had 

IF 




had to depend on the data they 
could carry in their own heads and 
by modern standards his mind 
was well-stocked — he had always 
been blessed with an atavistically 
good memory. Just as the in- 
vention of writing eliminated the 
blind bards who could recite ten 
thousand lines of Homer without 
prompting, and the invention of 
computers eliminated the mathe- 
maticians who could multiply 
ten-digit numbers in their heads, so 
the invention of diagnostic 
tools had discouraged the kind of 
doctor who could distinguish five 
hundred types of fever by simple 
inspection. But Pavel had taken a 
great interest, when he was a stu- 
dent, in the history of medicine 
and he was confident that most of 
what he had learned was there in 
his mind, ready to be used. 

Or was it? Was that a euphoric 
delusion due to the stimulant he'd 
injected into his arm? 

He had no way of telling. He 
could only order himself to pro- 
ceed very cautiously. 

Right: he had a patient waiting, 
providing Andrew hadn't died in 
the meantime. He selected what he 
thought would prove most helpful 
from the pile of drugs and instru- 
ments before him and, for want of 
anything better as a light source, 
added a retinal examination 
torch, whose beam was no thicker 
than his finger but was at least nice 
and bright. 

EASY WAY OUT 



And went back to Andrew's 
cabin. 

II 

A S HE put out his hand to slide 
the door back he was struck 
by a terrifying premonition. Dur- 
ing his search of the wreck he had 
seen few actual corpses — apart 
from that disgustingly squashed 
body hurled against the end of the 
corridor— but he knew the rest of 
them must be there, under the 
mountain of sand which had 
collapsed on the hull. 

Suppose that during his absence 
Andrew had died. He was hardly 
what you'd call a fit young man; he 
overindulged in liquor, probably in 
drugs too, and certainly he over- 
ate. He was far too fat for his age, 
twenty-two or twenty-three. 

If Andrew had died Pavel would 
be compelled to wait alone for a 
rescue party — with no one to talk 
to even if the talking were no more 
than an exchange of insults — and 
no guarantee that he was going to 
be rescued. 

Until this moment, he'd taken 
rescue for granted. He'd been 
aware that the Pennyroyal had 
dropped out of subspace almost an 
hour before the explosion, leaving 
as usual plenty of margin because 
emerging from subspace close to a 
sun was dangerous and an old ship 
like the Pennyroyal had to allow 
some one and a half to two AU 

89 




when entering a system like this. 

This voyage from Halys to Car- 
teret was a routine affair— a milk 
run, as the ancient argot termed it. 
Nonetheless, even if Captain Mag- 
nusson didn't keep what you would 
call a tight ship, he would presum- 
ably have signaled ahead to tell the 
port controller on Carteret that 
they were in real space again. 

Presumably. 

Pavel felt abruptly ill. No, he 
was being too kind to the cap- 
tain— ni/ mortuis . Putting it 
bluntly, Magnusson had run a slop- 
py ship, the worst of the dozen or 
so Pavel had signed aboard. The 
chances were that the explosion 
which had wrecked the Pennyroyal 
had been due to neglect'Df some of- 
ficial safety precaution. And there 
was a risk, small but not to be ig- 
nored, that Magnusson might have 
thought signaling ahead to their 
destination was superfluous. 

In which case there might be a 
long wait before him. A very long 
wait. And if he had to face it on his 
own — could he stand the strain? 

He slammed back the cabin door 
violently to wipe out the picture 
which had arisen in his head: the 
sight of himself, face in the rictus 
of Hippocrates, surrounded by the 
empty drug phials he had retrieved 
from the surgery. 

At once a whining voice came to 
his ears, and he was so relieved that 
he almost failed to pay attention to 
the words. 



‘‘You went away and left me!" 

What? 

He turned on the torch and ap- 
proached the bunk. Andrew spoke 
again. 

“You came in before — I heard 
you. You left me lying in this ter- 
rible pain! Damn you, damn you!" 

Pavel was about to blurt an 
angry rejoinder, but he caught 
himself. Instead he said soothing- 
ly, “I went to get some drugs and 
instruments. You're in a bad way, 
Andrew." 

“You went away and left me 
alone in the dark." The voice 
would have become hysterically 
loud, but on the last breath it broke 
into a whimper and then came 
sobs, shrill and grating, like those 
of a spoiled child denied a piece of 
candy. 

It should have been anyone but 
Andrew- anyone! 

Maybe, though, this petulance 
was ascribable to his pain. That 
could be dealt with. Pavel selected 
an injector from the handful he had 
brought and placed it against An- 
drew's exposed right arm, pressed. 

“Oh, it's you." As though time 
had been turned back, the voice 
had reverted to normal, complete 
with the sneer Pavel had learned to 
detest during their voyage. “The 
so-called doctor who can't even 
treat a simple headache." 

T hat was an allusion to their 
last encounter. Andrew had 



90 



IF 




called for him— not come to his 
surgery, like the others— and in- 
sisted he had a migraine. Thor- 
ough, punctilious, Pavel had 
checked him out and his instru- 
ments had confirmed what he had 
already started to suspect: the 
young man’s complaint wasn’t mi- 
graine at all, but a hangover from 
a drunk that had lasted three days 
without an interlude which might 
have allowed the body’s own de- 
fences to flush poisons away. And 
he’d said so, adding that Andrew 
was on the verge of alcoholic 
poisoning. Andrew had roared 
that he was a liar and unfit to 
practice his profession. He had 
gone so far as to report Pavel to 
the captain — not that that made 
much impression. Captain Mag- 
nusson, fundamentally, resented 
the regulation which compelled 
him to have a medical officer on 
board at all and would have been 
happier with mere machines, 
since they were cheaper. 

Pavel said roughly, “You have 
something a lot worse than a head- 
ache.’’ 

Andrew’s forehead creased. 
“Why are you shining that light at 
me? Why is it dark in here?’’ 

“Why the hell do you think? We 
crashed, of course.’’ 

“Crashed?’’ Andrew almost sat 
up, but Pavel put a heavy hand on 
his shoulder to prevent him. 

“Lie still. You have a broken 
back, probably a broken pelvis and

all kinds of internal injuries. I gave 
you a pain-killer, but if you want to 
live you absolutely must not 
move.” 

“What?” Fretfully Andrew 
seemed not to have taken in what 
he’d been told. He made to lift the 
coverlet and winced. 

“Hell, that hurt! And you said 
you’d given me a pain-killer! Can’t 
you even use the right drug to — ” 

“Now you listen to me,” Pavel 
rasped. He was picking among the 
gear he had brought, looking for 
the collapsible limb-tractor. 
“You’re about as badly broken as a 
man can be and still expect to sur- 
vive. Have you got that?” 

Andrew’s face crumpled like a 
wet paper mask as he realized: This 
is happening to me! 

He said, “We crashed?” 

“Why the hell else do you imag- 
ine your bunk is on the wrong side 
of the cabin? What do you think 
threw all your belongings across 
the floor? If you hadn’t been in 
your bunk, but up and about like 
everybody else, you’d be under a 
thousand tons of sand.” 

“None of your needling! I live 
the way I choose to live — and if 
other people don’t like it that’s 
their bad luck.” 

“Oh, shut up.” Pavel was as- 
sembling the limb-tractor now. 
“Make the most of the pain-killer I 
gave you. There isn’t much 
left— and the only other thing I can 

91 




do to dull the pain you’d feel with- 
out it would be to give you a total 
block on the lower spinal 
cord — and I’m not sure it could be 
reversed. It might mean your be- 
ing paralyzed. If you want to walk 
around again, a whole man, you 
listen to me and do as 1 say. 
Clear?” 

The blurred oval of Andrew’s 
half-open mouth trembled. Pavel 
was getting through. 

”A11 right. Now I’m going to 
have to fix your left arm. It’s dis- 
located, but this will reseat the 
shoulder in its socket.” He hefted 
the limb-tractor. **So brace your- 
self. You probably haven’t suf- 
fered much pain in your life, but 
human beings used to put up with 
far worse than what you'll feel. 
Now if I can get around this bunk 
to the other side—" Moving as he 
talked, he found there was just 
enough room for him to stand. 

"They also used to put up with 
head lice a id fleas and open sores," 
Andrew snapped. ‘‘We've made 
progress since those days." 

Surprised to find that this 
spoiled young man had even heard 
of such things, Pavel lifted the 
insensitized arm and fitted the 
tractor around it, trying not to 
think about the nauseatingly 
wrong angle it made at the 
shoulder. He said, “There hasn’t 
been much progress here. We seem 
to be on the next planet out from 
Carteret. It hasn’t even evolved 



into the Pleistocene Age. Right, 
here we go.” 

He snapped the spring of the 
tractor and the shoulder-joint re- 
engaged with a thud. Perfect. 

D etaching the device again, 
he heard Andrew say, “Well, 
what about you, then?” The old 
acid burned in his tone, as though 
he were constitutionally incapable 
of talking to people without seek- 
ing ways to making them feel 
small. “Were you in your bunk too, 
like me?’' 

“No. I was thrown clear through 
the surgery bulkhead and into the 
compartment full of furs. By a 
miracle they were all out of their 
bales and — ” 

“Well, hell!" Andrew crowed. “I 
saved your life!" 

“What?” The next stage would 
be to cleanse and examine the in- 
jured man’s lower body; Pavel was 
already selecting the gear he re- 
quired for the job. He paused and 
glanced up. 

“Saved your life," Andrew re- 
peated with a harsh attempt at a 
laugh. “I was bored last night. I 
woke that man — what’s his name? 
The one from the fur dealers?” 
‘‘You mean: what was his 
name?” Pavel said glacially. “He's 
dead." 

“I didn’t like him anyway," An- 
drew said. “But I woke him and 
told him to show off his goods. 
Made him take them all out of 



92 



IF 




their packing. Well, I’ll be 
damned! If I hadn’t done that you’d 
have been — ” 

‘"Killed,” Pavel broke in. “But 
you would have been dying here in 
terrible pain.” 

“The hell I would,” Andrew 
said. “That’s not my style. You 
should know that by now.” 

Worriedly, Pavel stared at him. 
One of the side-effects of the drug 
he’d used, in certain susceptible 
types, was a kind of megalomaniac 
euphoria. It appeared that Andrew 
must be susceptible. 

“No — look just to your right,” 
Andrew went on. “See that black 
case?” 

Pavel complied and noticed a 
square dark case which he must 
narrowly have missed treading on 
when he went around the bunk to 
apply the limb-tractor. He picked 
it up. It weighed good deal for its 
size. 

“There’s a combination lock. 
Press five, two, five, one, four,” 

With the help of the torch Pavel 
did as he was told and the lid 
sprang back. His blood ran 
suddenly cold. 

“Know what that is, do you?” 

“Yes,” Pavel heard his voice as 
gritty as the wind blowing across 
the dunes outside. “I should have 
guessed that this was what you 
meant. It’s an Easy Way Out.” 

S MALL. No longer, no thicker, 
than his forearm. But unbeliev- 

EASY WAY OUT 



ably expensive. This sleek blue 
plasteel cylinder with its white cap 
on one end, bedded in a shock-ab- 
sorbent lining covered with red vel- 
vet, might easily have cost half as 
much as the Pennyroyal. 

It was a legal development of an 
earlier device which had had to be 
banned because on planet after 
planet it had stolen the hope of sur- 
vival from pioneers worn out with 
their attempts to overcome the in- 
finite problems an alien world 
could pose. Cynical and cold- 
blooded entrepreneurs had 
bought early versions of the ma- 
chine — which filled half a space- 
ship — and made fortunes by luring 
settlers into imaginary universes 
so delightful they were happy to 
starve to death rather than give up 
their next session of pleasure. Sev- 
eral worlds that were now offic- 
ially freehold in the power of a 
single family had been, as one 
might say, “cleared” in this man- 
ner. 

When the scandal threatened to 
reach epidemic proportions. 
Earth’s sluggish government had 
finally enacted a law. By then, 
however, the profit to be had from 
using the machines had shrunk; 
there were few worlds remaining to 
be grabbed. And in addition 
miniaturization had— as always- 
progressed, so that they could be 
held in one’s hand instead of 
sprawling out through a fifty-me- 
ter hold. Also— as always — the 

93 




law was a compromise. It was not 
forbidden to manufacture the 
things, only to purchase or use 
them if one was not a bona-fide 
space-traveler or engaged in some ' 
occupation so dangerous as to 
involve the risk of fatal accident. 
In practice, that meant they were 
sold to space-tourists, govern- 
ment officials and chief officers 
of space-lines. They were rich. 

Activated — and all it required 
for activation was a twist of the 
white cap and a firm push — it 
broadcast a signal direct to the 
brain of anybody within range, in 
other words within about a hun- 
dred meters. The signal forged a 
link, so to speak, between the 
brain’s pleasure-centers and the 
memory, diverting the remain- 
ing resources of the body into the 
construction of a delectable 
dream so absorbing, so con- 
vincing, that minor matters like 
loss of blood, starvation or in- 
tolerable pain were instantly for- 
gotten. Trapped in a collapsed 
mineshaft, sunk beneath an ocean 
with an hour’s worth of air, lost be- 
tween the stars, one could live out 
the balance of his life in an ideally 
happy illusion. According to 
temperament, it could be 
erotic— or an orgy of eating— or a 
tussle with a favourite hallucino- 
gen — or the accomplishment of a 
lifelong ambition — or . 

Or anything. Literally, anything. 

In principle, then, it was a mar- 



velous and humane idea. What fate 
could be crueler to an aware, sen- 
sitive being than knowledge of in- 
escapably impending death? When 
there was no hope of rescue, better 
that a man should end his days in 
unalloyed delight. 

Fine. 

But the moment that cap was 
pressed home, it was certain that he 
would end his days. It was a ges- 
ture implying suicide. Once those 
new neural paths had been burned 
into the cortex, there could never 
be any retreat from death. 

According to what Pavel had 
read, this had not been true of the 
earliest versions. One could re- 
cover from those, as one could 
from the ancient addictive drugs, at 
the cost of incredible self-disci- 
pline and long, slow, painstaking 
psychiatric help. With a model as 
advanced as the one he held 
now — no. 

H e shut the lid and jumbled 
the lock again, and carefully 
placed the case on a shelf where 
Andrew could not reach it. 

‘‘What are you doing?” Andrew 
cried. ”You said you knew what it 
was. Can't you turn it on?” 

”Yes." Pavel averted his face 
and focused his little torch on his 
medical gear, making a great busi- 
ness of picking put what he would 
need to complete the job he. had 
barely started. 

'Then—” 



94 



IF 




“Oh, shut up!" With a fury that 
appalled him — it was no tone for a 
doctor to use to a patient. “Or I'll 
shut you up." He grasped an 
anesthetic injector, not local like 
the one he had already adminis- 
tered, designed to inactivate pain 
nerves selectively, but one which 
would blot out the whole nervous 
system. “In fact — " with growing 
resolution— “I guess I’ll do that 
anyway." 

He clapped the injector against 
Andrew's arm. 

“You bastard!" Andrew said 
huskily. “You devil — you ..." 

His voice failed. His eyes, glint- 
ing in the pale beam of the torch, 
shut against his will. Seconds later 
he slumped inert. 

7/5 kinder, anyway . 

But Pavel knew, even as he 
pulled the coverlet from the bunk 
and mechanically began to occupy 
himself with the foul job of 
cleaning excrement and dried 
blood from Andrew's lower body, 
that that was not the truth. There 
had been as much violence in that 
act as if he had given Andrew a 
punch on the jaw. And the reason 
he needed to let his violence erupt? 

Even though his mind was pre- 
occupied with his work, even 
though the effect of the stimulant 
injection he had given himself was 
partly used up by the low-oxygen 
air and the hunger which 
now — paradoxically — was making 
his stomach growl audibly, he was 



able to reason it out. He was scared 
out of his wits. He was young by 
modern standards, if not as 
young as Andrew, being only 
thirty-five and looking forward to 
a probable lifetime of at least a 
hundred and twenty. Proportion- 
ately, vis-a-vis Andrew, he was in 
the situation of a man just come 
of age would have been when deal- 
ing with a twelve- or thirteen-year- 
old boy. 

As though imposing a penance 
on himself for his surrender to an- 
ger and fear, he made a particular- 
ly thorough and careful job of the 
cleansing process, undertaking 
manually some of the most re- 
volting parts, for which he could 
have used an instrument, assum- 
ing the instrument was working 
after the crash. Presently he dis- 
covered that the stimulant was 
wearing off completely and de- 
cided not to take a second dose be- 
fore eating. 

By then he had done absolutely 
all he had the resources to do: An- 
drew was in a spider’s-web of med- 
ical devices which would minimize 
pain, extract fatigue poisons 
directly through the skin, cleanse 
him whenever his bowels and 
bladder leaked and insure him 
against the vanishingly small risk 
of some degenerative infection 
such as gangrene. Provided res- 
cue arrived within fifteen days, 
Andrew should not merely sur-

health to endure the major oper- 
ation on his spine necessary to re- 
store his power of ambulation. It 
was an achievement to be proud 
of. 



N OW it was high time he 
thought about himself — as 
clearly as the air would let him. 

He was thirsty, he realized, not 
just dry from the arid air of this 
planet but actually dehydrated 
from his hard work. He had a num- 
ber of phials of distilled water in 
the surgery — including several of 
liter capacity — which had been so 
well packaged that they had re- 
mained intact. He also had a fair 
supply of glucose solution and 
other instant-energy concentrates, 
various stimulants which rapidly 
invoked the '‘second-wind'' pro- 
cess in muscle tissue, many differ- 
ent tablets and capsules which, al- 
though intended exclusively for 
metabolic tests, could be used as 
nutriment in emergency, and even 
a range of chemicals that gener- 
ated free oxygen which he could 
use if the sparse natural air and the 
pressure of excess CO 2 were 
handicapping him for some really 
urgent task. 

But so long as he could manage 
without drawing on those supplies, 
the better his chances would be of 
lasting until rescue arrived. He 
would rather starve until a ship 
came down to collect him and leave 



with a store of unused supplies be4 
hind him, than ... I 

Or would he? 

He sat down, only half intending; 
to, on a stool which had surpris- 
ingly remained upright in the 
tangle of the surgery, and he 
remembered to shut off the torch 
he was carrying. A little light, now 
very red because the sun was set- 
ting, showed his surroundings to 
him. He faced, at long last, the 
fundamental reason for his — his 
attack on Andrew. 

He didn't believe with his whole 
being that he was going to be res- 
cued. He didn't believe that any- 
thing would be done to organize 
search parties until the Pennyroyal 
was so much more overdue than 
the normal range of variation in 
her schedule that somebody on 
Carteret grew angry. He hadn't 
made many voyages on Magnus- 
son's ship, but he was well aware 
that a difference of a week or two 
one way or the other in time of 
docking on any given planet the 
ship serviced didn't seem to worry 
the captain. 

Unless Pavel could improvise a 
beacon, preferably a powerful 
radio beacon . 

And he was trained in medicine, 
not engineering or electronics. If he 
was reluctant to use his own pro- 
fessional aids because he feared 
they might have been rendered un- 
reliable, how could he trust a radio 
or subspace signaler even if he

IF 




managed to rout one out from the 
mass of sand engulfing the after 
part of the ship and connect it to a 
power supply? How would he 
know whether it was crying for 
help, or simply lighting up the 
state-of-circuit lamps? 

He thought of the daunting pro- 
cess of shoveling sand away, en- 
countering corpses, of being frus- 
trated because food-capsules had 
smashed open and the contents 
were inedible . 

And then he thought of the Easy 
Way Out. 

Y es, that was what was fright- 
ening him more than the risk 
of dying here, forgotten, on an un- 
inhabited world. 

If he had not known that the 
EWO existed, if he had been able 
to occupy himself solely with prob- 
lems of survival, he might have 
made it. As things stood, knowing 
that the choice lay between an 
agonizing death and a delightful 
one, he found himself tempted. 
‘‘No-" 

It astonished him that he should 
have shouted the word out loud and 
he leaped to his feet. Something in 
the very depths of his mind had 
said: I dont want to die at all. 

That made sense. He didn't want 
to be here on Quasimodo IV? He 
didn't want to be have a vast ache 
all down his legs and a twisted 
ankle and a dry throat and 
particularly he didn't want a 



patient who insulted him when he 
was trying to help. But he did want 
to live. With almost three-quarters 
of a lifetime ahead of him, he 
hated the idea that he might be 
doomed by someone's careless- 
ness. 

Unsteadily, head pounding, with 
only the pencil beam of the torch to 
guide him, he set off on a second 
exploration of the ship. 

HI 

H ours passed. His watch 

was working but he had for- 
gotten to check it when he awoke 
after the crash— and when it did 
occur to him to look at it he found 
it wasn't much use. It had been set 
to the arbitrary ship's day and as- 
sured him the "real" time was a 
fe,w minutes before noon. But the 
star-spangled sky, of which he 
caught occasional glimpses, re- 
mained dark. He vaguely remem- 
bered having read somewhere 
that the day of this planet was 
much longer than Earth's, well 
over thirty hours. So it wouldn't 
even be possible to predict dawn 
until he had seen one— and an- 
other sunset. 

But that was a minor matter. He* 
had biological clocks in his body 
which were more important. The 
loudest-chiming one was in his 
belly. He was sure that by now his 
increasing weakness was due less 
to lack of oxygen and his many 

97 



EASY WAY OUT 




bruises than to simple hunger. 
And, inescapably, thirst. 

Accordingly he directed his first 
efforts at digging toward where 
he knew the ship's restaurant had 
been located, on the side of the 
hull opposite his surgery. But this 
had been crushed far worse than 
the other side. The sand was piled 
high and spilled down to replace 
whatever he scrabbled away. He 
was on the brink of despair when 
he recognized something shin- 
ing in the beam of the torch. 

Sand-scraped, the label told him 
plainly: Whole Milk. 

He seized the bulbous can and 
raised it to his lips, ignoring the 
sand that clogged the outlet. The 
sand was presumably sterile. If it 
was not he had already been ex- 
posed over and over to whatever 
minor life forms it bore. He gulped 
down the milk in huge draughts, 
thinking with a detached portion 
of his mind that there was — or 
should have been— something 
symbolic in this action. 

But this planet was not one he 
could envisage substituting for 
Mother Earth. 

After that he found a whole 
group of similar containers, ap- 
parently the contents of a shelf 
which had been in the compart- 
ment adjacent to the restaurant 
and which had been slammed 
through a bulkhead in the crash. 
Many of them were crushed and 
had leaked their contents, but he 



recovered more milk, various 
types of consomme and broth and 
five or six types of puree. Beyond, 
there was a mess of fresh fruit, in- 
cluding apples, papayas and a 
mutated citrus he was fond of, 
called yabanos, resembling a 
lime bloated to the size of an 
orange and with deep pink flesh. 
He eagerly tore at its peel and had 
already set a chunk of it to his lips 
when he realized what his^sense of 
touch had been trying to warn him 
about: the crash had hurled this 
fruit into something made of glass 
and the glass had smashed. The 
whole of it was permeated with 
tiny sharp spikes. 

He spat it out and threw it away 
in fury. 

This time he didn't shout it 
aloud, but he said it inside his 
head, very forcibly: / am not go- 
ing to take the Easy Way Out! / 
am not! I am not . 

And then that honesty he detest- 
ed compelled him to add: At least 
. / don't think I am. 

He took one final look at An- 
drew, who was still unconscious, 
and gave him an injectorful of 
glucose-and-vitamin booster. He 
had found some high-protein con- 
centrates and other life-supports, 
but Andrew was carrying enough 
fat on his belly to last him several 
days, and he certainly wasn't go- 
ing to become dehydrated over- 
night — or whatever the equiva- 
lent of ‘"overnight" might be, mea-

sured in terms of how long it took 
Pavel to wake up after he col- 
lapsed on his pile of furs. His own 
cabin, far astern in the crew’s 
quarters, was unreachable, but a 
dozen furs in the corridor afford- 
ed a soft bed within earshot of 
Andrew if he recovered con- 
sciousness. 

The rest . 
could wait . 
until later . 

T urn it on! Damn you— 
damn you! Turn it onV 
Pavel came awake in a second. 
The cry, eerie in the echoing cor- 
ridor, had seemed a continuation 
of the dream he had been suffer- 
ing, a vision of endless wander- 
ing over a vast bare desert. He 
forced himself to his feet, aware of 
the nasty clinging of his clothes to 
his body — normally he changed 
twice a day and threw worn cloth- 
ing into the recycler, but that was 
smashed. During the night a 
breeze must have blown away the 
stench left by the fires inside the 
ship; the air now, although still 
very dry and oxygen-poor, smelled 
of nothing at all. 

When he had lain down to sleep 
he had set the torch and a number 
of flasks and medical phials near- 
by. Now, though, he did not need 
artificial light— the sun must be 
well up in the sky and pouring in 
through all the cracks in the 
hull — and he was too dazed to 



worry about the other things. He 
stumbled into Andrew’s cabin, 
rubbing his eyes. 

Calm overtook him as he saw the 
medical equipment he had rigged 
yesterday. It was self-powered 
against failure of the ship’s pow- 
er; its state-of-operation lights 
continued to gleam like little rep- 
tile eyes. And indicated no 
change worth noticing in An- 
drew’s condition: metabolism 
survival-prone, skeletal struc- 
ture paralysis-prone, nervous sys- 
tem pain-prone. 

’That! That thing!” 

Andrew shouted, as loudly as he 
could, and raised his right arm to 
point at the shelf where Pavel had 
set the EWO. 

’’Turn it on!” 

Pavel drew a deep breath. His 
head felt as though it had been 
stuffed with sand from outside, his 
mouth was as dry and harsh as 
though the sand had been inserted 
by that route and his stomach was 
full of gas bloat. Also his ankle 
seemed to have become worse dur- 
ing his sleep, not better, and when 
he rested his weight on it he 
winced. 

Reaching out, he took the EWO 
off the shelf and wordlessly car- 
ried it from the cabin. Behind him 
Andrew screamed and howled. 

It occurred to Pavel that he 
should pitch the EWO out of the 
ship altogether, into the sand, 
where night- wind would cover it 



EASY WAY OUT 



99 




and make it impossible to find 
again. But even as he was tensing 
his muscles to toss the thing away, 
he relented. Rescue, after all, 
might wot come . 

Of the many cupboards in his 
surgery only one had not had its 
doors torn off the hinges. He put 
the EWO inside and slammed the 
doors and twisted the lock shut, 
thinking as he did so: Out of sight, 
out of. 

My mind? 

But he didn’t want to think 
about that. 

When he returned to Andrew's 
cabin he heard, from several 
meters away, a helpless moaning 
noise. He hurried his last few steps 
and found Andrew with his hands 
over his face, weeping. 

''Okay, okay," Pavel said, and 
touched the younger man's arm 
reassuringly. "I'm here and I 
have my—" 

"Turn it on, " Andrew moaned, 
his hands muffling the words. 

"I've taken the EWO away," 
Pavel said. And waited. 

"What?" The hands dropped 
from Andrew's tear-wet face. "But 
it's mine. If I tell you to turn it on 
you've got to turn it on. 1 can't bear 
to lie here and suffer this pain!" 

"Would you rather throw away 
the rest of your life," Pavel said af- 
ter a moment to ponder his choice 
of words, "than survive to enjoy 
all these things you kept boasting 
about on the trip — all the money, 

100 



luxury and power your family's 
possessions will bring you?" 

Andrew hesitated, letting his 
arms fall to his sides. He looked 
through fear-filled eyes at the med- 
ical equipment enclosing his body 
from the waist down. 

Pavel went on waiting. 

Abruptly — and unexpectedly - 
Andrew said, "I guess if you don't 
have too much anesthetic left you'd 
better save it for when I start to 
scream. But do you have a tran- 
quilizing shot?" 

A WAVE of relief swept over 
Pavel. He had never heard An- 
drew speak in such a reasonable 
tone before. He said, "Sure. Not 
much of that is left, either, though. 
My whole stock of drugs was 
thrown through the surgery bulk- 
head along with me— and even if 
some of them were saved from 
breaking by landing in the furs 
it'll take a while for me to dig them 
out. Here's something to be going 
on with, at least." 

He selected the right injector 
from the mixed batch he had 
brought and applied it. 

"Thank you," Andrew said, even 
before it had taken effect. "1 — 1 
guess I should apologize for shout- 
ing at you." 

Pavel shrugged. 

"How are you?" 

"Me?" Pavel's surprise showed 
in his voice. "Oh — I'm not too 
bad." 



IF 




‘M asked you a question. Don’t I 
deserve an answer?” 

‘‘Well— ” Pavel licked his lips. 
‘‘My head aches like fury— but I 
guess yours does too. It’s the air. 
My throat is sore, but that's the air 
too — it’s very dry. When the crash 
came I acquired a gang of bruises 
and a twisted ankle. Now you 
know. And as a doctor I can 
promise you I'm in far better 
shape than you are.” 

"‘Obviously.” A ghost of a smile 
showed on Andrew's pale face. 
“I'm in the kind of mess it would 
take a major hospital to cope 
with, aren't I ?” 

Pavel nodded. There was no 
point in trying to conceal the 
truth. 

“Then why the hell won't you 
turn on the EWO?” Andrew blast- 
ed. 

Pavel froze. He said at last, 
“You spoiled brat. Damn it, 1 
don't know a name to call you that 
would say what I think,” 

“Now look here-" Andrew be- 
gan, but Pavel plunged on. 

“Before you try any more of 
your tricks, get this into your solid 
plasteel head, will you? I want to 
stay alive, even if you don't. 
You've been pampered all your 
life, so even a hint of pain makes 
you want to give up. But you can't 
con me into doing what you want; 
you can't threaten me into doing 
what you want; you can't wheedle 
me into doing what you want. For 



once in your life you're simply go- 
ing to have to do what someone 
else wants. You’re going to sur- 
vive for as long as you can. That’s 
how most people live.” 

There was a dead silence. Since 
Pavel had waked, the whole ship 
had been silent, apart from the 
soughing of a light wind across the 
gaps in the hull. The trickling 
noise he had heard yesterday in^ 
the surgery, the sifting noise of 
sand filling a few remaining 
spaces in the after part of the ship, 
the creaking of the girders as they 
cooled — all that had come to an 
end. The only items in operation, 
the medical equipment, were too 
efficiently designed to make a 
noise even after the punishment 
they had taken. 

Then the artificial calm of the 
last shot he had been given oyer- 
spread Andrew's face. He said, 
“Well, if you're so determined to 
keep me alive, you might as well 
make me comfortable, too. I am 
in pain, you know.'' 

“All right," Pavel conceded. 
“But I'll have to make it a short v 
dose. I'll have to accustom you 
gradually to supporting some of 
your pain. I'm afraid. There's no 
way of estimating how long it will 
be before we're rescued." He pro- 
duced and applied the correct in- 
jector. 

“And I’m afraid I can't be 
absolutely certain how badly your 
internal organs are affected,” he 



EASY WAY OUT 



101 




went on. ‘‘To be on the safe side, 
ril have to keep you hydrated 
with an intravenous transfusion 
rather than letting you drink." 

“But I'm very thirsty," Andrew 
said in a dull tone. 

“I imagine you must be. I have 
some tablets you can suck to keep 
your mouth and throat moist, but 
they, too, will have to be rationed 
out." 

“Because we may be stuck here a 
long time," Andrew murmured. 
“What makes you so sure we are 
going tb be rescued, hm?*' 

“Look, we're in the same system 
as Carteret," Pavel said. “We're 
going to be reported overdue. If 
a live detector happens to have 
been anywhere in the vicinity, it 
will have picked up our blip. It 
might even have tracked us to im- 
pact." 

“Hell, if it tracked us to impact 
no one will bother to come search- 
ing," Andrew said. “Everyone 
was killed but us, right? If they cal- 
culate the speed we had when we 
broached air -they'll take it for 
granted we just burned up." 

Pavel put on his most reassur- 
ing manner. 

“Not if 1 can dig out something 
to make a beacon with," he said, 
“I'm not an engineer, but 1 hope 
to find a solid-state transmitter 
sooner or later— and a capacitor 
or something to drive it with. 
I'll— uh— I'll leave you now and 
get on with it." 

102 



“Thirsty!" Andrew said. 

“Oh, of course. I'll get you one 
of those tablets to suck." 

Behind the closed cupboard 
doors the presence of the EWO 
seemed to mock him when he en- 
tered the surgery. 



H aving made a frugal break- 
fast from half a can of fruit 
puree, Pavel sat down to work out 
a plan. In this sparse air he dared 
not overexert himself. On the oth- 
er hand, he must work quickly in 
order to improve their chances of 
survival, either to fix the beacon 
he'd talked about or simply to lo- 
cate more provisions. 

In a while, despite his aching 
head, he had worked out what 
seemed to be a logical course of 
action. He hunted around for 
something he could adapt as a 
shovel, found a plastic chair with 
one metal leg still attached and, by 
wedging the leg in a crack in the 
wall and leaning on it with his full 
weight, straightened it so that the 
chair seat made a kind of flat scoop 
and the leg a handle. Fine. Very 
pleased with himself, he set about 
digging where he had found the 
bulbs of soup yesterday. 

And almost at once discovered 
a mangled corpse. 

The thought crossed his mind 
that if he absolutely had to, he 
could reserve the canned supplies 
until last— and eat meat. It should 



IF 




remain good for a long time in this 
dry air, away from Earth-type bac- 
t^ia. 

Revolting . better the EWO 
than cannibalism . 

Maybe. 

He moved the body and with 
much effort dragged it to a gash in 
the hull and pushed it outside. He 
scrambled after it and dragged it 
out of sight down the dune and 
flung a few shovelfuls of sand after 
it. Then, aching in every limb, he 
decided to walk around the ship 
instead of going straight back in- 
side. 

The going was very difficult; the 
dune was so dry, he sank over an- 
kles at every step. But he managed 
to carry out a complete inspec- 
tion of the exposed part of the ship 
and the more he saw, the mor^ he 
marveled at his own escape. A 
bare fifth of the vessel's length was 
visible and as badly cracked as a 
hard-boiled egg ready for shelling. 
His heart sank. Was there any 
hope at all of finding serviceable 
equipment to rig his beacon? 

There was only one way to find 
out. He went back to his digging. 

Time passed in a monotonous 
slow blur. He fell immediately 
into the routine which he was to 
follow for the rest of their stay. He 
dug for a while, making either the 
discovery of a .corpse or the loca- 
tion of a bit of intact equipment, 
an excuse to break off, then went to 
see Andrew and attend to his re- 

E ASY WAY OUT 



quests or inform him that they 
could not be met. 

T he first time he told Andrew 
he would have to lie in pain a 
bit longer before another shot, 
Andrew curled back his lip and 
said, “I've got you figured out. 
You like this." 

“What?" 

“You like this. You like having 
someone totally helpless — the 
way I am. Gives you a sense of 
power." 

Sweat beaded his face, but evap- 
orated almost at once into the dry 
air. 

“Nonsense," Pavel said rough- 
ly, looking over the equipment at 
the foot of the bunk. One of the 
lights which had been green had 
turned red. But there was no help 
for that. 

“I know your type," Andrew 
whined. “Nothing suits you bet- 
ter than" 

“Shut up," Pavel said. “I'm try- 
ing to keep us both alive. And, if 
possible, sane. Don't start on 
crazy fantasies like that, or you'll 
run the risk of making me angry. 
I'm already living on my nerves." 

“What does a doctor do when his 
patient makes him angry? Turn 
off the life-supports?" 

“No." Pavel drew a deep but un- 
satisfying breath. “Gets out of 
earshot and stays there." 

He marched out of the cabin and 
slammed the door. In the corridor 

103 




he leaned for a while against the 
wall, head on hands. But there was 
work to do. He roused .himself and 
returned to it. Not for the first 
time, as he mustered all his en- 
ergy and thrust the improvised 
shovel into yet another heap of 
sand, he wondered sickly why he 
was wasting his time. He was now 
well into the section where he 
ought to have located usable elec- 
tronic or subelectronic equip- 
ment if any had survived — and all 
he was finding was charred or 
half-melted masses of metal and 
plastic. There had been a fire here, 
a hot one. Also, now and then, he 
found items from spacemen's uni- 
forms, such as buckles and rank 
badges. And bones. 

It took him almost three 
days— daytimes, rather— to clear 
the section of the ship of which he 
had the highest hopes. The only 
thing he found that was any use at 
all was a solid-state emergency 
lamp, its lumen-globe intact and 
its powerpack barely below 
maximum. Night was falling 
when he came upon it. He switched 
it on, thinking how wonderful it 
was to have a proper light. 

And then, with a pang of con- 
science, how terrible it must be for 
Andrew lying alone in the dark, 
forced to wait hours between anes- 
thetic shots. He picked up the lamp 
and carried it to Andrew's cabin. 

Andrew did not at first react to 
the sound of the door sliding 



back — it moved noisily now be- 
cause the finest grains of sand sift- 
ed everywhere when the wind rose 
and the groove at the bottom was 
covered with them. When he 
opened his eyes, however, he did 
not comment on the lamp. 

He said, “Pavel, you — you look 
terrible." 

“What?" Pavel touched his face. 
It had beard stubble on it, of 
course, and no doubt dirt and sweat 
had mingled to cover his skin with 
a layer of grime. He hadn't given 
thought to his appearance for a 
long while. 

“Could be," he said gruffly. 
“But never mind. I found this 
lamp. I thought it would be useful 
for you. I could get you something 
to pass the time now you have 
light — maybe a book, if you like 
reading. Or a game from the 
recreation room. I dug into that 
and found a few things." 

Andrew seemed not to be listen- 
ing. He said, “Why in the galaxy 
are you driving yourself this way? 
Did you find a way to send a signal 
to a search-party ?" 

Pavel licked his lips; they tasted 
of dust. “I found quite a lot of 
stuff, but—" 

“But it doesn't work ?" 

“No. I'm afraid it's all smashed 
up." 

“I thought it would be," An- 
drew said. Now, by the bright clear 
light, Pavel coujd see that his 
cheeks had suddenly become 



104 



IF 




sunken. Another lamp shone red 
on the medical gear enclosing his 
legs. Yesterday it had been green. 
Red for danger. “Pavel, you ought 
at least to leave the EWO where 1 
can get at it. Suppose — well, sup- 
pose you dig into somewhere and a 
girder falls on you. Suppose 
you’re hurt and can’t get back to 
wherever you put the thing.’’ 

“I don’t want to use it," Pavel 
said obstinately. 

"And you won’t keep me free of 
pain all the time — ’’ 

"I can’t because — ’' 

"Oh, save it.’’ Andrew sighed 
and rolled his head to the side op- 
posite the lamp, shutting his eyes 
again. 

The ungrateful bastard, Pavel 
thought and strode out. 

IV 

T hat night he dropped off to 
sleep the moment he lay on his 
couch of furs in the passageway 
outside Andrew’s door. He 
dreamed of far-off worlds where he 
had been happy and relaxed, 
where he had basked in warm sun- 
light and eaten luscious meals in 
the company of pretty women— 
the dreams shocked him awake. 

Has Andrew somehow got at the 
EWO and turned it on? 

That thought blasted through the 
euphoria and brought him bolt up- 
right with a jerk. Standing up and 
waking were simultaneous. It 



was dark; he had turned off the 
lamp to conserve its powerpacpk, 
Andrew being asleep also. But he 
had left it on a shelf just inside the 
cabin door, and the door was ajar. 
He located it by touch and 
switched it on. 

Andrew was lying, very pale and 
sweating again, with his fists 
clenched and his jaw set. Another 
red light had appeared at the foot 
of his bunk. 

"Damn it, you’re in agony,’’ 
burst out of Pavel. 

"I didn’t want — to — wake you." 
Andrew forced the words past 
tightly clamped teeth. "Thought 
you — you deserved your rest." 

What in the galaxy was happen- 
ing to this spoiled young man? But 
Pavel wasted no time on wonder- 
ing about it— he had, as usual, 
placed a selection of phials and 
other equipment by his. couch. 
Seizing an injector, he gave An- 
drew a full shot of pain-killer. 

"Thanks," the younger man 
whispered and the drawn expres- 
sion faded from his face. "Sorry I 
disturbed you. I guess I cried out 
without meaning to." 

"That’s okay," Pavel said awk- 
wardly. "Actually, you didn't." 

"You know something?" An- 
drew stared at the ceiling. "I’ve 
been thinking. I guess I never had 
to think so long about the same 
thing, over and over, in my life be- 
fore. When the crash happened, 1 
was scared. I didn't realize— I

kept telling myself it couldn’t 
possibly be happening to me — not 
to Andrew Alighieri Solichuk- 
Fehr. And — well, the way I see it 
now, I went on trying to hide the 
truth. Didn’t 1? Don't bother to an- 
swer. I know I’m right. And here 
you’ve been working like a -like a 
robot, while knowing what can be 
done and what can't. Well, imag- 
ine it had been the other way 
around. Imagine that I’d been up 
and walking about and you were 
stuck in a bunk like me, busted all 
to hell. I wouldn’t know what to 
do. I’d go crazy. I’d have just 
turned the cap of the EWO and 
given up." 

Pavel listened, hardly believing 
his ears. 

"So I - -well, rd just like to say 
I’m obliged to you. I think it’s the 
most amazing luck that you were 
the other person who survived. 
It's finally dawned on me that 
without you I’d be dead." 

His fists clenched again, but not 
this time from pain. 

"And you’re right. It’s stupid to 
die when you don't have to. It's 
stupid to quit just because you 
can’t take a little pain, just be- 
cause you’re gambling on the 
chance of being rescued and you 
can’t figure the odds. Hell, I've 
gambled on a dozen planets for 
things much less important than 
life— for mere money. And I swear 
I wouldn't have bet on my chance 
of still being alive after that crash." 



"Nor would I,” Pavel said in a 
gravelly tone. From the corner of 
his eye he noted that the last red 
light had reverted to green, a sign 
that it had been the pain that had 
been putting the dangerous stress 
on Andrew’s metabolism. Dilem- 
ma: whether to keep the pain 
damped down in order to protect 
his life-functions— or to husband 
the supply of pain-killer and make 
his life bearable, if not comfort- 
able, for the greatest possible 
length of time. 

It was too much to think about 
right now. Pavel’s mind was still 
fuzzy with sleep. Anyhow, An- 
drew hadn't finished. 

"You're sure we're on Quasi- 
modo IV?" 

Until this moment, Pavel hadn't 
been certain that Andrew had 
taken in the information he'd 
been given about their situation. 
"Yes. At least, as sure as I can be 
without checking out some sort of 
data on the system we were bound 
for. I haven't dug into the library 
section yet, but I think I'm com- 
ing fairly close." 

"Well, instead of wasting my 
time on games and that sort of non- 
sense, why don't you bring me what 
you can salvage in the way of 
books and reels? 1 guess if there's a 
magnifying glass or microscope 
to be had, 1 can make out a reel. 
But without power there can’t be 
much hope of reading tapes, huh?" 

"True enough. But— sure. I’ll do 




my best. Find some way of magni- 
fying a reel so you can read it up 
against that light/' 

‘"Great," Andrew said. “Now 
you go back to sleep or fix your 
breakfast, or whatever you want, 
ril be okay until this shot wears 
off. And for as long afterward as I 
can honestly stand the pain." 

"pA VEL kept thinking as he bur- 
rowed deeper and deeper into 
the accessible regions of the ship 
that it helped enormously to know 
that he had a companion in ad- 
versity after all, someone he 
could talk to, instead of a burden 
on his time, a constant worry. He 
did in fact locate a scratched and 
broken piece of transpex with a 
high magnifying factor, some 
data reels and a few scorched 
books whose pages had to be 
turned very carefully in order to 
prevent their crumbling, and An- 
drew, propped up just a little on 
his pillow, somehow contrived to 
read a few of them by the portable 
lamp. There were only passing 
references to Quasimodo IV — it 
never having been a planet of 
much interest to spacemen — but 
what little he gleaned confirmed 
that that was where they were, and 
moreover that they were current- 
ly on the same side of the local sun 
as Carteret. 

But in that case . 

Why haven t we been rescued al~ 
ready? 

EASY WAY OUT 



The fourth, fifth, eighth days 
melted into the past almost fea- 
turelessly. The strain of working 
in low oxygen was weakening 
Pavel; he hated waking up and of- 
ten his digging was reduced to the 
mindless act of a machine, so that 
he had already shoveled aside a 
piece of potentially useful equip- 
ment before his sluggish brain 
recognized it. Then he had to go 
scrabble for it with bare hands in 
the pile of sand behind him. And, 
of course, all the time he kept find- 
ing dead bodies. 

For a brief while, following An- 
drew’s remarkable discovery of 
courage, the cupboard where he 
had stored the EWO held no threat 
to Pavel. A day— two days— later, 
and the blisters on his hands and 
the grit in his mouth and the red- 
ness of his eyes and the endless, in- 
curable thirst he suffered from 
conspired to reawaken its specter 
in his memory. Instead of being 
here, victim of harsh reality, he 
could be in a lovely, imaginary 
world, enjoying himself in any 
way he chose, picturing the most 
beautiful girls, the smoothest 
lawns, the finest beaches. 

He drove the ghost away. 

The supply of drugs dwindled, 
though he hoarded them careful- 
ly. So did the protein concen- 
trates and glucose-and-vitamin 
solutions which were all the food 
he could offer Andrew. Luckily 
he had had just enough of a sub- 

107 




stance which triggered the body’s 
use of stored fat — a short-cut for 
overindulgent passengers, basi- 
cally, who now and then realized 
at the end of a long spaceflight 
that they had put on two kilos 
while they were shut up in the metal 
shell of the ship and wanted to re- 
vert to normal weight before land- 
ing. He had never expected to 
make practical use of what he or- 
dinarily regarded as^ a cosmetic 
drug. The two injections of it 
which he had given to Andrew, 
however, had worked well, and 
though his skin was now deflated 
over his premature paunch— like a 
collapsed balloon — he was able to 
utilize what long overindulgence 
had stored between his muscles 
and his skin. 

Pavel took more and more fre- 
quently to going outside and star- 
ing up at the sky, knowing it was 
ridiculous to do so. One couldn't 
see an orbiting rescue ship by 
day —and if it arrived during the 
night it would no doubt fire signal 
flares and perhaps sonic missiles 
-to wake survivors up and pro- 
voke them into lighting fires or 
somehow revealing their presence. 

Fires? 

T he idea should have come to 
him much earlier; in fact, it 
didn’t strike him until he finally 
had to concede that further dig- 
ging was useless. The part of the 
ship he hadn’t yet cleared of sand 

108 



had collapsed and he lacked the 
strength and the tools to force aside 
the strong metal girders now 
blocking his progress. 

He had been aimlessly post- 
poning the admission that noth- 
ing else constructive was left for 
him to do when the notion of mak- 
ing a fire occurred to him. At 
night a fire could be spotted a long 
way off under this clear sky. He 
had seen clouds only once since the 
crash and those only on the hor- 
izon around the setting sun. Pre- 
sumably an ocean lay in that di- 
rection, but a rise in the 
ground— a range of hills or moun- 
tains — filtered all the moisture 
from the wind before it blew this 
far inland. 

Andrew had found scant refer- 
ence to the meteorological pat- 
tern of Quasimodo IV in the 
charred books Pavel brought him. 

Was anything left in the wreck 
that would flame brightly in this 
thin air? Pavel made tests, 
cautiously, with flammable liq- 
uids from his surgery: alcohol, 
ether, some otherwise useless 
tinctures and suspensions which 
bore fire warnings on their labels. 
Satisfied that it might indeed be 
possible to light a fire, he set about 
resifting the great mounds of rub- 
bish he had thrown aside, dividing 
them into two new categories: 
things that would catch light and 
things that wouldn’t. That occupied 
a day or two more. 



IF 




Little by little, however, he be- 
gan to find himself obsessed with 
the passage of time. 

If we can last four more 
days — three more days, two . 

He caught himself up with a 
shock. There still was no promise 
of rescue. In his mind the fifteen- 
day period he had estimated as 
the limit of the time he could keep 
Andrew alive had evolved into an 
article of faith: If we last out fif 
teen days well be okay . 

What grounds did he have for 
believing that? On the contrary, 
he realized, now that eleven, 
twelve, thirteen days had leaked 
away, their chances of being saved 
were less, not more. Even if Mag- 
nusson had been notoriously 
sloppy about routine matters, 
such as signaling to the port he 
was bound for when his ship 
broached normal from subspace, 
they should have started search- 
ing long ago. 

The vision of the EWO shut in 
the cupboard rose before him and 
sang an inaudible song of mock- 
ery. 

W EAKENED by his efforts, 
short oxygen and with barely 
sufficient food, he had taken to 
spending an hour or two each day 
between exhaustion and slumb- 
er in conversation with Andrew. 
The first few times had been a sort 
of stimulant for him; he had never 
had any clear concept of what life 

EASY WAY OUT 



was like for someone who was due 
to inherit one of the great for- 
tunes of the galaxy, coming as he 
did from average, ordinary stock 
on both sides of his own family: 
pioneers five generations back, 
who seemed to have used up their 
ambition and initiative in the 
singlp crucial act of leaving Earth. 

He himself, by deciding to sign 
as a space medical officer before 
settling to a regular career, and 
moreover saying that it might not 
be on his home world of Caliban 
that he chose to practice, had 
shocked all his relatives. They 
were no longer geared to star 
travel. By contrast, Andrew's 
background since he was born had 
included the concept of galaxy- 
roaming: Uncle Herbert is on 
Halys and sends his love, or may- 
be, I think well take the kids to 
Peristar this year . 

Not that Andrew himself had 
appreciated his good fortune un- 
til now. He had looked on it more 
as a distasteful duty than a rea- 
son for excitement and enjoy- 
ment when he had been instructed 
to tour the family holdings. 

Now, listening to Pavel explain- 
ing his attitude, he seemed to 
have come around to the view that 
he had been stupid, wasting an op- 
portunity thousands, millions of 
young men would have sold their 
right arms for. Head constantly 
aching, unceasingly shaky on his 
feet and having to concentrate 

109 




with all his force like a man strug- 
gling to pretend he isn’t drunk» 
Pavel had done his best to en- 
courage Andrew — until the eve- 
ning of the day when he admitted 
to himself that even if they did last 
out for the two weeks he had in- 
vented as a deadline they were 
probably doomed anyhow. 

Then he was snappish and ill- 
tempered, heard his own voice re- 
viving accusations from the 
PennyroyaVs last voyage— refer- 
ences to Hans, references to drunk- 
enness, references to laziness and 
greed and lack of consideration for 
other passengers. Hurt, at first sur- 
prised, later angry, Andrew retort- 
ed in kind, and the sjiould-have- 
been friendly chat wound up with 
a grinding slam of the cabin door. 

But the last thing Pavel had 
glimpsed was not just one more red 
light — he’^d grown accustomed to 
one a day, on average, added to 
the original total — but a whole 
new cluster of them, which yester- 
day had been green. 

Shaking from head to foot, he 
waited in the corridor for as long 
as it took to calm himself. Then he 
reopened the door. 

“I’m sorry,’’*’ he said. “I’m 
ashamed of myself. You’re in ter- 
rible pain. The lights — ” He ges- 
tured at them. They were natur- 
ally turned away from the patient. 

“I know,’l Andrew muttered. 

“What?’’ 

“Of course I know.” With re- 



newed anger. “That machine of 
yours wasn’t designed to be used 
in a completely dark room, but a 
hospital ward with twilight ooz- 
ing out of the walls — right? Every 
night when you switch off the lamp 
for me to go to sleep, I can see the 
light reflected over there — ” ges- 
turing — “and I can tell that it’s 
more red than it was before. I 
know I’m in a bad way, for heav- 
en’s sake! I know!** 

The last word peaked into a cry. 
Pavel bit his lip. He said, “I 
guess I haven’t been completely 
honest with you. I--well, I no 
longer believe in being rescued. 
If we were going to be rescued it 
ought to have happened by now. 
Do you want me to — ’’ 

“Switch on the E WO?’ ’ Andrew 
broke in, “No — No! And no again! 
You were right to take it away 
from me. Lying here, pain or no 
pain. I’ve come to realize how 
precious life can be. No, I don’t 
want you to use it. Take it out and 
bury it— smash it with a ham- 
mer — anything.’’ 

His voice cracked with pain. 
Sweat glistened on his skin. 

“Well — uh — all right then,’’ 
Pavel said. “Good night.’’ 

“Good night.” 

Pavel dreamed about the EWO 
again. 

T he nightmares didn’t stop in 
the morning. 

When he opened the cabin door, 

IF 



110 




having slept badly, he found An- 
drew not just asleep but uncon- 
scious. All but four of the lights on 
the medical equipment had gone 
to red. A glance at their pattern 
confirmed that it was the struggle 
to resist pain that had worn him 
out — that, and the exhaustion of 
the last phial of nutrient solution 
in Pavel's limited stock. There 
was enough water left to keep him 
hydrated and enough tissue in his 
muscles for the ‘‘second-wind" 
process to keep his basal metabo- 
lism turning over for a few more 
hours -perhaps a couple of days, 
if he remained inert. 

Beyond that point? 

Certain death. 

Pavel stared in giddy disbelief. 
He tried to tell himself that it was 
an achievement to have kept An- 
drew alive and conscious, in his 
condition, for such a long 
time— not fifteen ordinary days, 
as he had somehow been fool 
enough to' imagine, but fifteen of 
these extra-long local days. It was 
a medical miracle in its small 
way. Hardly any modern doctor 
could have managed it without 
the aid of a full range of diagnostic 
and supportive equipment. 

But what was the use of having 
done it when nobody else would 
ever find out? 

All hope seeped out of his mind. 
His overstrained will to survive 
collapsed like a bridge required to 
carry too great a load, folding al- 

EASY WAY OUT 



most gracefully into an un- 
recognizable tangle of struts and 
pillars. He was barely Pavel 
Williamson any longer as he 
turned with machine-precise 
movements and headed for his 
surgery. 

In that cupboard he had passed 
so many times waited the Easy 
Way Out. 

He took it, sleek and chill, from 
its case and turned it over and over. 
It was well past dawn and there 
was plenty of light to see by. 

/ denied him this, Pavel thought. 
/ could have ended his life in ecs- 
tasy instead of a vain, stupid, 
pointless struggle against pain. 
Now he will die, unconscious, 
and — and he turned out to be a nice 
guy in his way. / feel almost fond 
of him — and horribly ashamed of 
myself. 

Because fm going to use what / 
forbade him . 

Convulsively he twisted the 
white cap of the EWO and pressed 
it down. It sank visibly along the 
main shaft and a humming rose. 
Pavel closed his eyes. 

Disbelievingly he opened them 
again. All was exactly as it had 
been. Except the EWO. Heavy in 
his hands, it was now also growing 
hot. 

He let it fall with an oath. A hiss- 
ing noise followed, and a puff of 
smoke spurted from the capped 
end. The cap — some kind of plas- 
tic, he guessed — became de- 

111 




formed and darkened. 

After that it simply lay there. 

He stared at it incredulously for 
a long while: how long, he could 
not tell. He felt like a suicide who 
took much trouble over choosing 
and knotting a rope only to have it 
break under his weight. 

"‘ril be damned,” he said 
furiously at last. ‘‘For all that 
pretty case with the combination 
lock — for all the padding it was 
nested in — it broke when we 
crashed. It doesn’t work!” 

The thing was no longer smok- 
ing. He touched it and found it 
merely warm. Snatching it up, he 
swung around to leave the surgery, 
blind with rage. 

‘‘Til pay him back'"for leading 
me on this way,” he heard himself 
muttering. “Fll get even. Fll— ” 

What is that? 

From somewhere outside came a 
roaring sound. The crumpled steel 
of the corridor vibrated. Pavel 
stood still, one hand already out- 
stretched to slide back the door of 
Andrew’s cabin. 

The roar faded, then grew loud- 
er again. He stared in horror at the 
EWO in his hand, thinking: Did it 
work after all? Is this an induced 
illusion, the fantasy of rescue? 

But, surely, knowing how 
ashamed he had been when he was 
finally driven to try and use the 
gadget, he could rule that out. Any 
illusion he was capable of enjoy- 
ing would exclude all memory of 

112 



the EWO, because even to recall 
its existence would remind him he 
was condemned to death. 

Uncertain, he turned around — 
and was suddenly pelting at full, 
lung-tearing speed toward the 
nearest opening in the hull to light 
his beacon with trembling fingers 
and keel over beside it for the res- 
cue party to locate. 



<<¥ GUESS someone should 

A apologize for our not coming 
to find you sooner,” said the doc- 
tor at the central hospital on 
Carteret. ‘‘But it was logical 
enough to abandon all hope the 
moment the PennyroyaVs course 
had been computed. I mean, you 
wouldn’t expect anyone to live 
through a crash like that, would 
you?” 

‘‘I guess not,” Pavel said. He felt 
very much better, although this 
oxygen-rich air was still making 
him a trifle giddy. ‘‘And when the 
people did turn up they came only 
for salvage, right? Not for 
rescue?” 

‘‘I’m afraid so,'-’ the doctor ad- 
mitted. ‘‘It was the insurance 
company covering that consign- 
ment of furs that chartered the 
ship that picked you up.” He hesi- 
tated. “By the way, I’d like to 
compliment you on the marvel- 
ous job you did on Andrew Soli- 
chuk. You know, his family is very 
big here on Carteret and if he’d 

IF 




been found dead — ” He ended the 
sentence with a gesture. 

“Yes,” Pavel said. “Yes, it was a 
pretty good job, though I say so 
myself.” 

He looked absently out of the 
window. This was a splendid mod- 
ern building, very expensive, sur- 
rounded by magnificent lawns 
and flowerbeds. He could see a 
swimming pool and a sun terrace 
where patients were soaking up 
the sunlight. Absently he ca- 
ressed something smooth and 
heavy on his lap. 

The EWO that hadn’t worked. 

He said suddenly, “How is An- 
drew now? I’d like to see him if I 
can.” 

“1 imagine that can be ar- 
ranged,” the doctor said heartily. 
“Of course, he was in very bad 
shape when he was brought here, 
but when they heard the news his 
family back on Earth signaled 
that we should spare no expense. 
He’s had the finest surgery avail- 
able on this planet. He’s up and 
about already — and as a matter 
of fact, I believe he asked to see 
you. Come with me.” Rising, he 
added with a chuckle: “Aren’t you 
glad that thing of yours was broken 
after all?” 

“What?” Pavel gave him a con- 
fused stare. “Oh, this?” He hefted 
the EWO. “It’s not mine.” 

“We assumed it was,” the doc- 
tor said. “You were clinging to it 
for dear life. When you were un-

SPEAKING Of being a Very Big Cor- 
poration— we were/ last month— 
(speaking of it that is), there are lots 
of traps In becoming a large corpo- 
rate structure. Immobility is one. 
There seems to be a direct correla- 
tion between number of people and 
the ability to move. We are trying to 
offset this by doing our publishing in 
separate pockets, as It were— hence 
Beagle, Walden, Comstock and the 
new London operation. Ballantine 
Books' far-flung Empire. All of which 
make it possible for the original BB's 
to nip off to places like San Francisco 
for a couple of days or to get Annie 
over here for a week (well, hell, how 
else would we have gotten the galleys 
of DRAGONQUEST read in time?) 
and for others to visit us from vari- 
ous points of our small globe. In this 
way we hope to< evade yet another 
problem of bigness— lack of commun- 
ication. 

• 

AS TO what happens within our of- 
fices of (now) Vk floors, it's a bloody 
mad house. We conducted a small 
poll recently and found that not one 
of the 90-odd bodies now located here 
would want it any other way. Work- 
ing in this firm does something to peo- 
ple. As an example of our esprit-de- 
corps (if that is, indeed, what it can 
be called) the entire Accounting De- 

113 






partment is flowering forth in beards. 
Formidable. A lot of us even read our 
own books— outside of the editors, 
that is. (This is a rare thing in a pub> 
lishing house.) This department must 
sadly admit to not being able to keep 
up with the whole list any more. Just 
the Adult Fantasy, Science Fiction, 
Mysteries, Westerns, Ecology, En- 
vironment, Comstock and sex books. 
Enough. 

• 

HAVING thus brought you adroitly 
to the discussion of books, what have 
we got for this month— a whole fleet 
of books from Fred PphI and Jack 
Williamson, namely: UNDERSEA 
QUEST, UNDERSEA FLEET, and 
UNDERSEA CITY-three to do with 
subsea academy types (did you see 
that crazy Cousteau film on the sea- 
dragons of Galapagos?) involved in 
various adventures, plus another 
group of Clark Ashton Smith stories 
-HYPERBOREA-our Adult Fan- 
tasy. Meanwhile all the H.P.^ Love- 
craft titles in Ballantine and Beagle 
go bouncing from glory to glory. 
Great stuff.

dergoing your psychiatric re- 
orientation they wanted to take 
it away, but when I saw how 
violently you reacted to losing it 
I told them they ought to let you 
hang on to it. A sort of mental 
sheet-anchor. You say it isn't 
yours?" 

“No, it belonged to Andrew." 
Pavel stared wonderingly down at 
the thing. "‘It must have sunk all 
sorts of barbs in my subconscious 
if I clung to it as you say I did. I 
guess it's time I got rid of it. I'll 
give it back to Andrew, let him 
know it wouldn't have helped any- 
way. He was at me to use it, you 
know, for days and days after we 
landed. I mean crashed." 

“I'm not surprised." The doctor 
nodded. “Suffcring the way he 
was — Still, according to what 
he's been saying, you infected 
him — so to speak — with the will to 
live. He's very anxious to see you 
again, you know." 

He courteously indicated that 
Pavel should precede Him through 
the door. 



A nd there he was: almost un- 
recognizably lean, nearly 
naked in the bright warm sunlight, 
with a few traces of scarring 
around his waist and lower back 
but grinning from ear to ear. He 
had been in the pool and drops of 
water were still running down his 
body, but he hurled aside the towel

IF 




he had been about to use and ad- 
vanced on Pavel with a shout of 
joy. 

“Pavel! How can I ever thank 
you for saving my life? You were 
right, right all along — if it hadn’t 
been for you, I wouldn’t be here 
now, back in one piece, able to en- 
joy life again! Here, let me shake 
your hand.” 

His voice changed even as he put 
out his hand. 

“What’s that?” he said faintly 
and all the color faded from his 
cheeks. “It’s — You bastard!” 

“What?” Standing uncertainly 
before him, Pavel held up the 
EWO. “You mean this? Why, I 
was just about to tell you. If 
you’d — ” 

“You devil!” Andrew snatched it 
from him and stared at the capped 
end. It was obvious that it had 
been pushed home. “You activa- 
ted it. After all your pious preach- 



ing you activated it. And — and — ” 

He looked about to be physical- 
ly sick. 

“And all this must be illusion 
after all! Which means I’m going 
to die— just as I’d finally found 
out how to enjoy being alive! You 
bastard, you devil!** His face 
contorted into a mask of fury. 

“Now just a moment,” said the 
doctor at Pavel’s side, stepping 
forward. Pavel himself was 
frozen with pure amazement, in- 
capable of speaking, barely able, 
to think. 

But the doctor was too late. 

Raising the heavy plasteel 
cylinder of the EWO above his 
head with all the force his newly 
discovered health and vigor afford- 
ed, Andrew brought it slamming 
down and smashed open Pavel’s 
skull as completely and as fatally 
as the hull of the wrecked Penny-

T hey were waiting for Andy 
Galt as he left the Weather 
Control Complex at the end of the 
Dawn Shift: Pinchot, sleek and 
dandified even in a Survey cover- 
all, Williver, big and soft, with a 
worried look on his too-small face. 
Gray, lean as a ferret, bright-eyed, 
nervous, and Timmins, silent as 
usual. 

‘‘You’ve heard?” Pinchot said. 
“They did it.” 

Galt nodded. 

“Some politico who's never been 
within five lights of Colmar de- 
cides we need to open another 
hundred miles of desert,” Gray 
said. “So five hundred* of us are 
going to be drafted and shipped 
out to the plateau to play the 
hardy pioneer.” 

“We knew they were going 
ahead,” Walt said, “Why act sur- 
prised?” 

“There was always a chance 
they'd. take our warning and back 
down,” Gray said. He had a thin, 
high voice, a mouth that seemed al- 
ways to be grinning a secret grin. 

“It couldn't have been more bla- 
tant if they were trying to goad us 
beyond endurance,” Pinchot 
said. “It's as if they were thumb- 
ing their noses and daring us to do 
something.” 

“We told them,” Williver said,

T he craslf of breaking glass 
was like an explosion in the 
darkness. Planetary Adminis- 
trator Andrew Galt came awake, 
rolled off the side of the bed and 
hugged the floor. In the silence a 
final glass fragment fell from the 
window frame to the rug. Galt got 
to his feet, saw the paper-wrapped 
bolt lying by the dresser. 

END TYRANNY ON COL- 
MAR was lettered neatly in red on 
the back of a recently published 
ration application form. Galt 
grunted and tossed the paper away. 
It was nearly dawn, he saw. He 
dressed and went down to the 
kitchen. Freddy, his butler-valet- 
driver-bodyguard-secretary was 
there, brewing coffee. 

“You're up early, Mr. Adminis- 
trator," he said formally. 

“No protocol this early in the

sounding frightened. He swal- 
lowed. ‘‘We held off until now to 
give them a chance to see reason. 
They didn’t. Opening a new sec- 
tor now is a smack in the teeth to 
every man in the colony." 

“It's not just a little kick in the 
mouth," Gray said. “It's slavery 
for all of us who are tagged to go 
out on the advance team. And for 
what? To give the Colonial Bu- 
reau a nice growth rate to brag 
about." 

“To fill politicians' pockets back 
on Terra," Pinchot corrected. 
“We're supposed to give up our 
homes, families, friends, move out 
into the desert, live in lash-up hut- 
ments, eat issue rations, work like 
horses fourteen hours a day — " 

“I'm not afraid of work," Galt 
said. “If it were on a voluntary 
basis 1 might even sign on." 

“But it's not voluntary, Galt. It's 
compulsory. They decide who 
goes and for how long." 

“Even here in town it's serf- 
dom,'' Gray said. “Look at 
you— with an advanced degree in 
administration — putting in your 
two years on a board at Weather 
like any clod. And Pinch, here, 
with a Master's in personel dy- 
namics " 

“What about the petition, Pin- 
chot?" Galt cut off the complaint 
impatiently. “Didn't you get an 
answer?" 



P INCHOT took a paper from 
an inside pocket, handed it 
over. It was a letter on the sta- 
tionery of the Colonial Admini- 
strator, formally — and patron- 
izingly, Galt thought— thanking 
the addressee for his interest in 
administration policy. 

“It was addressed to me by 
name," Pinchot said, “not to the 
Committee. Don't ask me how 
they knew. But it doesn't matter 
now." He tore the letter in two 
and tossed it aside. “So much for 
appeals to established authori- 
ty. We tried the peaceful way. 
Now we're taking matters into 
our own hands. So -are you with 
us, Galt- or against us?" 

“He doesn't have to be either," 
Timmins spoke up. “He's got a 
right to be neutral." 

Pinchot shook his head. “Not 
any more," he said. “The time's 
come to take sides." 

“The Committee of Fifty," Galt 
said, “consisting of forty-one 
members by actual count, out of 
over twenty-five thousand colo- 
nists — " 

“What percentage of French 
peasants staged the French Revo- 
lution?" Gray demanded. “How 
many Americans actually fired 
on the Redcoats? How many Bol- 
sheviks tj>ssed out the Czar?" 

“W'c^l do it," Pinchot said, his 
eyes na^- j'" and intent. “We move

in fast, lake the Port and the 
Comm Center, the generator 
and pumping stations, the depot 
and warehouses, grab Admin 
House — and we‘re in charge." 

‘‘What about the Security 
Force?" 

“We‘ll bottle them up in their 
barracks." 

“Spacearm could blow us off the 
planet." 

“But they won't. BuCol wants 
profits, that means operating 
mines and plants. We'll cooper- 
ate with them; they won't get 
rough. They'U#accepl the fait ac- 
compli ^ 

All heads turned as the soft 
H’A/rr of a lurbodyne sounded. A 
police carl came into view; the men 
stood silent as it coasted to a stop 
beside them. A tall, loose-jointed 
man in Security uniform swung 
down, sauntered over. He was a 
stranger, loo tall, too pale, out 
from Terra, not a colonial. 

“Let's see your IDs, fellows,*' he 
said in a nasal Terran accent. 
His partner sal stolidly on the 
carl, watching. The four colon- 
ists handed over their lags, which 
were scrutinized cursorily and 
handed back. 

“What are you doing here?" the 
Security man asked in a laz\ tone, 
as if he didn't much care but was 
asking anyway. Gall fell his face 
tighten. He shook off illis' re- 
straining hand. 

“Minding our own business." he 



said harshly. “Why?" 

The Security man looked him 
over casually. 

“Come over to the flat," he said 
easily. 

“What for?" Gall said. 

“Move," the cop snapped and 
flipped a small rod from his belt. 

Gall walked over to the carl. 

“Turn around, get your hands up 
behind your head." 

Galt followed orders. Careless 
hands slapped down his sides, deft- 
ly turned his pockets inside out. 
The Security man grunted. 

“That's all. Break it up now. I 
don't want to see you hanging 
around in the streets after five 
bells." 

The carl rolled away. Pinchol 
came over, picked up the items the 
Securiix man had dropped on the 
pavement, handed them to Gall. 

“They're nice fellows." he said 
softly, “just doing their job." 

"\\ hen?" Gall asked tightly. 

“Tonight. Be at the Watergate at 
midnight, read) for action." Pin- 
chol said. 

“I ll be there." Gall said. 

W ALKING through the dark 
street, Galt thought about it. 
He remembered stirring stories 
he'd read in grade school of hardy 
pioneers of half a century earli- 
er his grandfather among 
them - who had come out from 
Terra during the Population 
Riots to cast their lot for ihem- 



THE RIGHT TO REVOLT 119 




selves and their families on the vir- 
gin world called Colmar. 

It had been a terrifying cross- 
ing: five thousand men and wom- 
en in the hold of a marginally 
spaceworthy freighter, packed like 
sardines with barely space to 
move, fed on minimal rations, 
three bodies alot^ed to each bunk, 
sharing community toilets, with 
no amusements, no privacy, no 
relief for the long months of the 
voyage. 

And arriving at the end of 
it not on the soft, green world of 
open spaces and fresh air they'd 
been led to expect — but on the 
harsh bare rock of Colmar. 
There’d been riots then and some 
killing. But in the end the survi- 
vors had voted to stay, to take 
their chances on the new world, to 
conquer or die. 

Very melodramatic, Galt 
thought to himself. But whafs it 
got to do with today? They worked 
out their lives to give us — their de- 
scendants — something better. 

But do we have it? We*ve seeded 
the oceans, made soil, planted 
crops. Today we can talk in the 
open air without respirators, eat 
our home-grown vegetables; we 
have a town with an auditorium, 
a sports arena and a public li- 
brary , , , 

‘‘But we're still slaves," he said 
aloud. ‘‘We've been used; we dance 
to Terra's tune. The best of our 
products go off-planet in return 

120 



for a bare subsistence level of 
imports. And the time has come 
for a change." 

T hey were a vague crowd in 
the darkness. Galt pushed his 
way through, turning his face 
away from a beam of light from a 
pocket flash. Pinchot appeared, 
a white sweatband around his 
forehead. His face was taut; his 
tongue flicked restlessly at his 
lower lip. He handed Galt a small 
plastic-boxed talker. 

“You're on Te*in One, hitting 
Admin House. You worked a 
summer there as a messenger, 
you know the layout. You lie low 
until it's secured. If Gray — I 
mean, when Gray and his team se- 
cure The port they'll call in. Same 
with Tomkin, Pyle, Bergson — all 
the teams will report to you when 
they've pinned down their objec- 
tives. ITl liaise with you — " 

“Where am I supposed to hide 
while the rest of you are winning 
the war?" 

“You take cover in the park 
while the rest of the team goes in. 
When you see their signal— we're 
using survey flares— move in and 
take over the switchboard." 
Pinchot beckoned to a tall, lean 
man. “Fry's your Team Leader. 
You stick close to him until they 
move in. Okay, get going." 

Galt followed Fry and the other 
members of his team — two men 
and a girl named Teresa — as they 

IF 




threaded their way through the 
now-dispersing throng, turned 
east along the Outer Drive, head- 
ing for the park. The talker box 
muttered and crackled, monitor- 
ing terse conversations. 

As they turned into Park Way, 
Galt caught Fry’s arm. “That’s a 
copflat parked up there.” He 
pointed to a police cart under a 
pole light a hundred yards dis- 
tant. 

“There’s nobody near it,” Fry 
said and shook off his hand. 
“Come on. We’ve got three min- 
utes to get in position.” 

The party went on, entered the 
park via a service gate, crossed to- 
ward the line of trees behind which 
the lights of Admin House glowed 
peacefully. They halted beside a 
fountain which tossed sprays up 
into colored light. 

“There’s a gap in the hedge,” 
Fry pointed. “As soon as you see 
my flares, come in on the run.” 

Galt nodded and took up his post 
behind a screen of shrubbery as 
the others slipped silently away. 
They reached the street, started 
across. A fine mist of spray from 
the fountain dampened Galt’s 
face. An imported insect alighted 
on his neck. He brushed it away. 

The spotlights lanced out simul- 
taneously from two points; one was 
aimed downward from the roof of 
Admin House, raking across the 
lawn, pinpointing the gate 
through which Fry and Teresa 

THE RIGHT TO REVOLT 



were just passing; the other, from 
the parked copflat, struck the 
group horizontally, threw stark 
shadows against the hedges. The 
two conspirators caught outside 
the gate froze for a moment, then 
turned and ran, their feet noisy in 
the silent street. An amplified 
voice boomed out. 

“Stop where you are! Davies, 
Henddrson! We know you, you 
can’t get away — ” The voice broke 
off as light winked and a shot 
crashed from the gate. Fry was ly- 
ing flat in the shadow of the orna- 
mental gatepost. Galt saw anoth- 
er flash, but the second shot was 
drowned by the short savage roar 
of a police bullet-pump. Fry’s 
body was flung a foot into the air 
and hurled ten feet back like a bun- 
dle of rags. The two runners 
skidded to a halt and threw them- 
selves face down in the street. Galt 
saw Teresa reach the front en- 
trance of the government build- 
ing; as she ran up the steps, the 
door burst open and two uni- 
formed security men gathered 
her in. 

Men in battle armor, hand guns 
ready, were swarming into the 
street, clustering at the gate and 
around the captives. Heavy foot- 
steps sounded behind Galt. He 
hugged the ground, ducked as 
lights glared, playing across the 
shrubbery around him. A man 
went past less than six feet away. 

At that moment, the talker box 

121 




uttered a burst of static and a 
small clear voice said, “Power sta- 
tion secured. One man hurt and a 
couple of windows broken — oth- 
erwise no damage." 

The Security man who had just 
passed halted; gravel crunched as 
he swiveled, playing his light 
about. Galt eased back. The light 
flicked closer. He reached a large 
tree, got to his feet. A twig crack- 
led. 

“Stop there," the Security man 
barked. Galt ran. A shot sang 
through foliage. He heard sounds 
ahead, veered right, crashed 
through a head-high hedge onto a 
bricked path. Two uniformed men 
standing fifty feet away turned to- 
ward him; he plunged around a 
bench* dived into massed foliage. 
It yielded and he was in the clear. 

A tremendous blow on the calf 
of his right leg sent him tumbling. 
He rolled, tried to jump up, fell on 
his face. His leg was hot, numb, a 
dead weight. Scrabbling fran- 
tically with his hands, he dragged 
himself under a spread of juni- 
per, felt the ground crumble be- 
neath him. He rolled, fetched up 
with a thump in drifted leaves at 
the bottom of a drainage ditch. 

The voices and footsteps came 
closer, but they seemed remote 
and unimportant now. Galt's 
thoughts had leaped ahead, quite 
calmly, to the trial, the convic- 
tion, the prison sentence, the loss 
of his citizenship . 

122 



T he Dark was quiet now. Lis- 
tening closely, Galt could hear 
distant voices over the rustle of fo- 
liage in the light breeze; but noth- 
ing stirred nearby. He moved his 
injured leg tentatively, discov- 
ered to his surprise that it re- 
sponded, though painfully. He sat 
up, explored the wound. There 
was a neat hole in the mass of mus- 
cle below and behind the knee, a 
less neat hole to the left of the shin. 
A small calibre solid shot had 
gone through without hitting the 
bone. He rose to his feet. He could 
walk. He brushed leaves away, 
climbed out of the ditch and was 
confronting the hedge that bor- 
dered Government Street, 
Through a gap he could see the 
lighted front of Admin House. 
Uniformed men were on the ter- 
race, on the lawn. The front doors 
stood open, brilliantly lit. Floods 
illuminated the lawns. A dozen 
copflats were in sight parked 
along the street. 

At first Gall didn't see it; then he 
did: Two-thirds of the Security 
Force was here, posted two deep 
around the front of the house; and 
he could see that the rear service 
entrance was equally guarded. 
But the small and inconspicuous 
entry at the side was shrouded in 
shadow. Insofar as Galt could 
see no Security men were near it. 

The talker crackled and spoke: 
The Power Complex was in rebel 
hands. Pyle, at the port, called in: 



IF 




all secure. Bergson, sounding 
elated, reported the virtually un- 
opposed seizure of the pumping 
station. The uprising had gone 
well — all but the most vital part. 
Administrator Blum and Major 
Jensen had concentrated all their 
forces here. They hadn’t been 
fooled for a moment. They knew 
all about the Committee’s plans 
and had been ready. 

But there was that side door. 
Galt’s mouth was dry; his heart 
pounded painfully. It could be a 
trap. There might be half a dozen 
Sec men lying in wait for the 
mouse to take the cheese. But on 
the other hand, the door was little 
used; it was just possible that Jen- 
sen had overlooked it. 

Galt could slip away now, re- 
turn home, and be as surprised as 
everybody else when the news 
came out. Or he could put his neck 
solidly in the noose. 

With a curse that was half pray- 
er, he left his vantage point and, 
limping, slipped away along the 
hedge line. 

F rom a dump of shadow be- 
tween the library and the Agri- 
cultural Experimental Building 
Galt studied the scene.* He had a 
better view of the side door from 
here. Nothing stirred there. To 
anyone not intimately familiar 
with the building, there appeared 
to be an unbroken mass of shrub- 
bery along the east wall. Galt took 

THE RIGHT TO REVOLT 



a deep breath* and stepped out, 
crossed the street openly, two hun- 
dred yards from the lighted gate of 
Admin House. He went back past 
the west wing of the elementary 
school, crossed the playground, 
came up along a path to a point fif- 
ty feet from the rear corner of Ad- 
min House, paused for a moment, 
then ran across a strip of open 
ground to the door. There was no 
alarm. He tried the latch, then 
pushed with his shoulder. The pan- 
el yielded slightly. He stepped 
back, kicked straight out at the 
lock. Plastic and metal shat- 
tered, the door bounced in. Galt 
slid inside, shut the door and stood 
in darkness, listening. 

Voices sounded from the front of 
the house; somewhere a radio 
crackled and a toneless voice 
droned, too faint to make out the 
words. Feet clumped to and fro. 
There was a stair a few feet ahead. 
Galt felt his way in darkness, 
found the newel post, started up. 
He saw dim light above. On the 
second floor he looked along a 
carpeted hall. At the far end, a 
man in mufti with a paper in his 
hand emerged from a room, hur- 
ried away. Galt went on up. 

The third floor corridor was il- 
luminated. A uniformed Security 
man stood twenty feet away, fid- 
dling with the mechanism of his 
blastgun. The man bolstered the 
weapon, walked to the far end pf 
the hall, lifted a house phone from 

123 




its hook, began an inaudible con- 
versation. He turned his back to 
Galt's position, still talking. Galt 
slid out, eased silently along the 
passage to the intersection with 
the wide corridor off which' the ad- 
ministrative suite opened. 

Four Security men were in sight 
— two posted beside the ivory- 
enameled double doors, the other 
two at the main staircase. One of 
the men guarding the stairs de- 
scended a few steps to carry on a 
conversation regarding the 
wherabouts of someone named 
Katz. His partner leaned over the 
rail, his back to Galt. The two men 
on the door had their heads turned, 
following the exchange. Galt 
stepped out and walked silently 
and swiftly toward the door ad- 
jacent to the guarded portal. He 
was six feet from it when one of the 
men glanced his way, gave a start- 
led grunt and grabbed for his slung 
blastgun, fumbled it. 

‘‘Here, you, where you think 
you’re going?" he blurted. 

‘‘Special messenger," Galt said 
crisply. 

He reached the door for which 
he had been headed as the second 
guard swung his gun around; Galt 
tried the knob; it turned; he 
plunged through as two shots rack- 
eted in the hall, gouging molten 
plastic from the doorframe. He 
spun, slammed the door, tripped 
the security lock system, heard 
armor sliding into place as a heavy 

124 



body struck the panel from out- 
side. Men hammered and shouted 
as Galt ran across the room, 
paused for an instant at the con- 
necting door, picturing the slugs 
that would rip into his body if the 
administrator had posted guards 
inside his office as well as in the 
hall. Then he opened it and stepped 
through. 

Administrator Blum was a 
plumpish man with graying hair; 
he sat behind his desk, his eyes on 
the hall door, an expression of 
surprise on his face. As Galt ap- 
peared he whirled, reached for a 
desk drawer. Galt dived, knbcked 
the older man's hand aside, 
scooped up the 2mm needier, 
aimed it at Blum. 

“What — what — " Blum said, 
then collected himself. He 
straightened his clothing, fixed a 
stern expression on his round 
face, looked challengingly at 

Galt. 

“Well? You've forced your way 
into my office for a reason, 1 sup- 
pose, since you'll most certainly 
be taken into custody before you 
leave here." 

“Your Security men are over- 
paid," Galt said. “They're expert 
at harassing citizens but not so 
good when it comes to something 
complicated — like watching both 
sides of a house." 

Blum's features flinched. 

“I suggest you give yourself up 
at once, Andy," he said. “You've 

IF 




made your point. I’Jl personally 
look into the conduct of security 
affairs—" 

"I’m not here to complain about 
inefficient police work/' Galt 
said. "I'm here to take over the 
government." 

B lum stared across the desk at 
Galt, who pulled a chair around 
and sat down. The pounding at the 
door went on; an intercom screen 
on the administrator's desk 
buzzed insistently until Galt 
reached across and switched it off. 

"Andy," Blum said in a reason- 
able, kindly tone, "I've know your 
parents for thirty years. I remem- 
ber the day you were born — " 
"Make it Mr. Galt— Mickey." 
Blum jerked as if he had been 
stung by a wasp. "1 hardly think 
disrespect will advance your 
cause — whatever it is. Now, if 
you don't mind, tell me why you’re 
here. I suggest you hurry, since 
my Security forces* will be in here 
at any moment—" 

"1 doubt that. Your locks are 
pretty solid." 

"You can't possibly believe you 
can succeed in this abortive upris- 
ing!" 

"We have the port, the power 
plant. Comm Center. The major 
seems to have overlooked a cou- 
ple of bets while he concentrated 
on Admin House." 

"See here, Andy — Mr. Galt. 
You were always a level-headed 

THE RIGHT TO REVOLT 



lad, a good scholar, potentially a 
fine citizen and a valuable colo- 
nist. What are you doing mixed up 
with these anarchists? People like 
Daniel Pinchot — known radi- 
cals — soreheads — agitators — " 

"Dan was a Sector Scholar. He 
may be impatient with the es- 
tablished order, but he’s no fool, 
Mr. Administrator. I’m mixed 
up with him because it was that or 
go on the way we've been go- 
ing— and that wasn’t good 

enough.” 

Blum's face shifted to a look of 
grim determination. "1 hardly 
think it's the function of a hand- 
ful of malcontents to determine 
unilaterally what is or is not good 
enough for the welfare of the col- 
ony as a whole." 

"And you are?" 

"I was duly appointed by the Co- 
lonial Administration to carry out 
my function; I’ve been trained for 
this work; I have more years of ex- 
perience in administration than 
you have of life!" 

"I didn’t appoint you." 

"You're intelligent enough to 
recognize the fact that specialists 
who’ve devoted their lives to the 
problems of government and ad- 
ministration are better qualified 
to run matters than a pack of — of 
amateurs who regard any restric- 
tion of what they consider their 
freedom and righ^as intolerable 
burdens!" 

"A pack of profit-minded bu- 

125 




reaucrats and politicians who tell 
me 1 have to give up everything 
that makes life livable and devote 
a couple of years of hard labor to 
opening up new territories that 
we don’t need or want.” 

“You’re a fool, Galt. You don’t 
know what you’re talking about! 
The economy must expand, 
or—” 

“Or certain big corporations 
back on Terra won’t make as 
much as they’d like out of our 
blood, sweat and tears.” 

“That’s a childishly simplistic 
version of matters. Why — ” 

“You mean Parson’s Bay and 
General Logistics and North 
American Materials won’t show 
a profit from opening up the new 
sector?” 

“Well — of course they hope to! 
And why shouldn’t they? They 
funded the great bulk of the devel- 
opmental work, provided most of 
our specialized equipment, sup- 
plied technical experts — and still 
do—” 

“All at a nice return on their 
money. And we do the work. Es- 
pecially the five hundred names 
that got pulled out of a hat to open 
Sector Twelve.” 

“So, like impatient kindergar- 
ten children, you’re going to take 
over the nursery and make it all 
one long playtime, is that Th 
Andy — Mr. Galt?” 

“The mines will continue to op- 
erate, Mr. Administrator. We’ll 



still export — and don’t tell me how 
good and kind Terra is to buy our 
products. I know how scarce non- 
organically contaminated chemi- 
cals are today.” 

“Suppose a squadron of Peace 
Enforcers arrives to restore or- 
der — ” 

“That won’t open any mines.” 

B lum gazed at Galt. It was 
(quiet in the corridor now. A call 
light blinked on the big desk, ig- 
nored. 

“You want all the advantages of 
what other men have built,” Blum 
said slowly, “but you want them 
without working for them, with- 
out effort, without commit- 
ment or obligation. Well, the 
Universe doesn’t work that way, 
my young friend. Nothing is free. 
Society isn’t witholding your 
birthright. You have no such 
birthright — not in the sense you’re 
apparently demanding.” 

“1 have the same birthright any 
animal in the wild has,” Galt said. 
“To take what I can get and hold,” 
“So you'll seize the granary and 
eat until it’s empty. But who'll re- 
fill it for you, eh? You’ll grab the 
trideo set you've always 
wanted— but who'll repair it, 
who'll supply the power to run it, 
who’ll do the programing and the 
acting, who'll pay the bills?” 

‘‘We will. We're prepared to 
work as hard as required. But we 
intend to take the rewards for

ourselves — for Colmar — includ- 
ing you, Mr. Blum, if you decide 
to stay— instead of sending them 
off-world for the benefit of corpo- 
rate executives we’ve never met, 
who've never seen Colmar and 
never will.” 

”It's the arrogance of it that as- 
tounds me,” Blum said wonder- 
ingly. ”We all have our^obliga- 
tions, Galt, whether it pleases us 
or not. The food you eat, the 
clothes you wear, the entertain- 
ments you enjoy, the education 
you were given didn’t just pop up 
out of the desert. Someone made 
them. They represent human in- 
genuity and effort— and you’ve 
reaped the benefits.” 

“That’s a debt that’s passed 
along from generation to genera- 
tion, Mr. Blum. A man owes noth- 
ing to the past. Life can’t demand 
payment for itself.” 

“I’ve always thought you were a 
young man with a sense of de- 
cency, of justice, of regard for the 
rights of others. Tell me, Andy: if 
this — revolution of yours suc- 
ceeds by some wild chance— what 
then? Will you rest easily with 
your loot? Can you justify to your- 
self theft on a grand scale, and set- 
tle down to enjoy your stolen 
goodies?” 

“You’re taking the position,” 
Galt said, “that because the gov- 
ernment exists — ” 

“Legally,” Blum put in. 

“Because the government exists 

THE RIGHT TO REVOLT 



legally, that I’m therefore obli- 
gated to support it— or at least 
obey it. But I challenge that state- 
ment. Suppose the government 
were an outright tyranny: would 1 
be obligated to connive at my 
own enslavement?” 

“That's absurd—” 

“No. A man has a natural right 
that supersedes legal obliga- 
tions. Overthrowing a legally 
constituted government is trea- 
son — unless you win. Because if 
you win, you change the laws. Then 
anyone who supports the old gov- 
ernment is the traitor.” 

“This is mere sophistry, Galt. 
You can’t mean — ” 

“The right to revolt,” Galt said 
slowly, as if thinking aloud, “is the 
most basic right a man has.” 
“Activist jargon,” Blum snort- 
ed. 

“Not if we win — and we have 
won, Mr. Administrator.” 

Blum’s face flushed. “Nonsense. 
A pack of rabble-rousers couldn’t 
possibly have — ” 

“Wrong. We’re not rabble- 
rousers, we’re the rabble itself, 
Mr. Administrator. Mr. ex-Ad- 
ministrator. Check for yourself.” 
Blum turned to his communica- 
tor panel, poked keys. His face 
tightened as no lights responded 
to his calls. 

“You can still get through to 
Security barracks,’’ Galt said. 
“Call Jensen and tell them to put 
down their guns.” 



127 




B lum punched out the code. 

The angry face of Major Jan- 
sen appeared on the desk screen. 

“Mr. Administrator, thank God 
you’re all right!” 

“Never mind that," Blum said. 
“What's the situation?" 

“These hoodlums have invaded a 
number of installations, Mr. Ad- 
ministrator, but I can clean them 
out. Just the same. I'd suggest you 
get through to CDT Sector and re- 
quest a pair of PE's, triple UTU 
priority." 

“Pm afraid I'm not precisely at 
liberty to do that, Stig," Blum 
said. He angled the pickup to in- 
clude Galt, gun in hand. Jensen's 
face jerked. 

“What—" 

“The, ah. Revolutionary Com- 
mittee seems to have outflanked 
us," Blum said. 

“Stand fast, Mr. Administra- 
tor," Jensen said between 
clenched teeth. “My boys'll blast 
their way in there and—" 

“Lay down your arms, Jensen," 
Galt cut in, leaning forward. “We 
hold every strong point in the col- 
ony—" 

“I've got forty trained men on 
the grounds of Admin House," 
Jensen grated. “You'll never get 
out alive, you damned bandit!" 

“Don't talk like an ass, Stig," 
Blum said calmly. “He's out- 
manuvered you. It's checkmate." 
He looked at Galt. “What do you 
want from me, Andy?" 

128 



“Capitulate. Hand over control 
to the Committee and step down. 
I'll guarantee your safe con- 
duct — and Jensen's, too, unless 
he does something stupid, like fir- 
ing on our men." 

Blum stared levelly across at 
Galt. “Are you sure this is what 
you want? The responsibility—" 
“Tell him," Galt said harshly. 
Blum turned to the screen. “Lay 
down your arms, Stig," he said. 
“I'm signing a formal resigna- 
tion in favor of Andrew Galt." 

T en minutes later there was a 
brief clamor outside the door. 
Pinchot's voice came over the 
talker. 

“Open up, Galt! We're in com- 
plete possession." 

Galt crossed the room and re- 
leased the locking system. The 
door burst open. Gray came 
through, grinning a wide fox grin. 
He saw Blum, jerked up the wea- 
pon in his hand. 

Behind him, a gun fired from six 
feet; Gray shrieked as the gun flew 
from his hand in a spatter of 
blood. He went to his knees, grip- 
ping his wrist, his hand welling 
crimson, as other men crowded 
into the room. It was Timmins 
who had fired. He came forward 
to stand beside Galt. 

“Why the hell'd you do that?" 
Gray keened. “That's the pig that 
had Fry and Len and Jeannie 
killed!" 



IF 




"What did you expect him to do, 
give them a safe conduct?'" Galt 
said tightly. 

"Here, what's going on," Pin- 
chot said, pushing forward. 
"You'd better give me the gun." 
He held out his hand, the other 
hand resting on the butt of the pis- 
tol at his hip. 

"1 thought the idea was to im- 
prove government, not to start a 
reign of terror,” said Timmins. 

"There'll be no more killing," 
Galt said. "Get rid of the gun, Tim- 
mins." 

Timn^ins tossed the weapon 
aside. 

"Who are you to be giving or- 
ders?" Pinchot demanded of Galt. 

"I'm the only one here with ad- 
min training. I'll hold the office un- 
til we can stage elections — unless 
you want to start your new regime 
by killing me and maybe Timmins 
and a few others— and somehow I 
don't think a purge will convince 
BuCol that you're fit to run the 
Colony.” 

Pinchot stared at Gait, eyes nar- 
rowed. Then he relaxed, thrust out 
a hand. 

"Makes sense," he said. "Let's 
go, men." 

"You took a terrible chance," 
Blum said after the others had 
withdrawn. 

"I suppose that's part of an\ 
revolution, Mr. Adminstrator." 

Blum sighed. "Call me Mick- 
ey." he said. "There are a few 

THE RIGHT TO REVOLT 



things 1 ought to familiarize you 
with before I go." 

F our weeks later Galt sat be- 
hind the big desk, frowning at 
the papers before him. He shuf- 
fled through them, sighed. There 
was a perfunctory tap at the door 
and Pinchot came in. 

"Afternoon, Mr. Administra- 
tor," he said. "What are you look- 
ing so glum about? They elected 
you, didn't they?" 

"I'll step down in your favor any 
time, Pinchot." 

"No, thanks. I never did like pa- 
perwork." He eyed the stack on 
Galt's desk. "In any case, the CDT 
and BuCol have both recognized 
you as the people's choice. You're 
stuck with it. I'm quite happy as 
Chief of Operations." His genial 
expression faded a bit as he 
spoke. He swung a chair around 
and sat down. 

"In that connection, Galt — what 
about the import program 1 out- 
lined? You've had it three days 
now — " 

"1 know. Luxury goods. Offi- 
cial cars, cooler units, trideo pro- 
grams." 

"So? Don't we have the right to 
spend our money to suit our- 
selves? Isn't that what the take- 
over was all about?" 

"Sure. What money?" 

Pinchol's face went tight. "The 
price of the last shipment of ores, 
for example," he snapped. 

129 




‘Mt all went toward our credit 
deficit with Outplanet." 

"‘You expect me to believe 
that?" 

‘"You can check the figures with 
Anderson if you like. No matter 
how many times we add them up 
they still come out the same. We're 
running in the red - and what 
credit we still have has to go for 
necessities." 

"1 heard all that from Ander- 
son. That's why I'm here. It's not 
good enough, Galt. This isn't why 
we threw out BuCol - just to carry 
on the same old swindle." 

"'You can take over any time, 
Pinchot." Galt slid a sheet of pa- 
per across to the other man. "‘My 
resignation, all ready* for signa- 
ture." 

Pinchot stared at the document, 
pushed it away. 

""I don't get it," he growled. 
""You're spouting Blum's line, the 
BuCol line— " 

""It's nobody's line. It's just the 
facts, Pinchot. We're exporting 
X kilotons of minerals at Y creds 
per ton, and we're importing Z 
creds worth of basic material. 
And we're sliding a little deeper 
into the red every quarter." 

""They're overcharging us, hold- 
ing us up on prices—" 

""Negative. They're selling to us 
at seven percent under the open 
market scale. BuCol policy." 

“Then we can raise our 
prices—" 

130 



“Negative again. It's marginal 
now. If our prices plus haulage go 
above costs of local procurement 
and refining, we're out of busi- 
ness." 

“Then -what in God's name can 
we do?" 

Galt pushed another sheet of pa- 
per across the desk. Pinchot 
glanced at it, then stared at Galt. 

“Are you right out of your mind? 
This is Blum's Opening Order for 
Sector Twelve." 

“Wrong. It's my order for open- 
ing Sector Twelve." 

“You can't do it. The people 
won't accept it. What will Gray 
and Williver— and Pyle and 
Tomkin and the others say? 
They — we — risked our necks fight- 
ing this same crazy scheme." 

“We need more income, less de- 
pendence on imports. We have to 
extend our usable acreage and ex- 
pand our mining operations. If you 
can think of another way to do if. 
I'll welcome the suggestion." 

Pinchot's face looked slack and 
grayish. “Is this what we took 
over — the same old headaches, 
only worse?" 

“Did we really take over, Pin- 
chot?" Galt asked tiredly. “Or did 
they con us into standing on our 
own feet?" 

Pinchot swore. 

“I agree," Galt said. Now let's 
get to work. I need five hundred 
names for Sector Twelve. Any 
suggestions?" •

day, Freddy,” Galt said as he sat 
down at the table. few of my 
admirers came by to give me a 
nice sendoff for the day. Colmar’s 
twentieth anniversary of inde- 
pendence.” Galt gave a snort that 
was not quite the laugh he had in- 
tended. 

‘‘Don’t take it so hard, Andy,” 
Freddy said. He poured coffee, 
put a cup before Galt, sat down 
opposite him. “You’ve always 
done what was best in a tough situ- 
ation.” 

Galt looked at him sardonical- 
ly as he sipped the bitter brew. 
“Funny how you assume it wasn’t 
flowers they threw, Freddy. Any- 
body would think 1 wasn’t popu- 
lar.” 

Freddy lifted his powerful shoul- 
ders. “You can’t please ’em all,” he 
said. 

“It seems I’m not pleasing any 
of them.” 

“You’re doing what you’ve got 
to do, Andy. The Colony’s a mar- 
ginal operation. It’s not your fault 
that times are tough. These babies 
want it all now, that's all. They see 
loo much Interplan trideo, they've 
got ideas about how life ought to 
be fat and soft. They’ve got to face 
up to facts sometime. Colmar's a 
poor world. We just can’t afford a 
three-hour day and welfare cavi- 
ar.” 

“Try telling that to some Econ

graduate doing his time in the 
labor pool.” 

“I know; so they gripe. What 
about it? If they’d been here back 
in the old days they’d have had 
something to gripe about. Do they 
ever think about what the first peo- 
ple here had to face up to, seventy 
years ago?” 

“Of course not,’’ Galt said. 
“Why should they? These aren’t 
the old days. This is now. And 
they’re young. They want to live 
today, not some time in the next 
century. I can’t blame ’em.” 

“Sure — and so did your grandad 
want to live — and mine. That’s why 
they came out here — to nothing. 
To make something of it — of a 
dead world — something that 
hadn’t existed before. They had no 
guarantees, no route back. They 
had to whip Colmar or die — and 
plenty of them died.” 

“Ancient history, Freddy. Today 
they know there’s something bet- 
ter than hard work and rationing. 
They want it. And Freddy, so do 
I—” 

“But you're not whining for 
it— and one day it’ll hap- 
pen — you’re working for it like 
they did back then. It must have 
been a frightening thing, Andy, 
when they unloaded from the 
freighters and looked around and 
saw a dead world, not even a blade 
of grass. In seventy years we’ve 

131 




turned it into a place where a man 
can live — but not without effort. 
Let ’em gripe, Andy— just so they 
piir in their time like everybody 
else — like you did.” 

“Involuntary servitude. ‘Ty- 
ranny’ is what they call it.” 

Freddy snorted. 

“So? What are you supposed to 
do, back down because they call 
you dirty names? You know what’s 
got to be done, Andy. You're do- 
ing it. It takes guts. You got 'em. 
More coffee?” 

“No, thanks. I might as well go 
on down to the office. Maybe 
we'll beat the rock-throwers for a 
change.” 

“If it was me,” Fxeddy said in 
the :ar, “I'd stay home and to hell 
with ’em. Let 'em see how things go 
after a few days with nobody 
making the decisions. They're 
complaining now: let 'em see how 
it'd be if you. weren't on the job to 
untangle the knots — ” 

“Don't get carried away, 
Freddy. Any competent ad- 
ministrative type could do the 
same job.” 

“Maybe,” Freddy said. ‘‘It's not 
seeing what you have to do that's 
tough; it's doing it when the mob 
is yelling for your head. You could 
be the most popular man on Col- 
mar tomorrow if you'd give in." 

“And we'd be bankrupt the day 
after. Sure, Freddy. But those are 
just facts; they don't have any ap- 
peal to the emotions." 



A FEW early pickets gaped as 
the administrator’s car swung 
in through the open gates. In his of- 
fice, Galt attacked a stack of pri- 
ority applications: fifty tons of fab- 
ricated steel sections for Shaft # 
209 versus sixty tons of the same 
urgently needed for the exten- 
sion to the loading docks; four 
loads of feeder fuel in stock to be 
allocated among nine agencies, 
all yelling for immediate ac- 
tion; computer components on 
order4or six months by Supply, 
demanded by Routing to pre- 
vent imminent shutdown of the 
entire NW range . 

Galt looked up at a sharp rap at 
the door. Timmins, the executive 
officer, poked his head in. Through 
the open door Galt could hear 
sounds of an altercation. 

“Another delegation to see 
you,” Timmins said. Galt rose and 
went out into the corridor. From 
below came voices raised in an- 
ger, other voices replying. Feet 
clattered on the stairs. A dishev- 
eled young man in maintenance 
grays appeared, Freddy close be- 
hind him. 

“Hold it, Freddy,” Galt said. 
Both men stopped. “Let him come 
up.” 

“Chief, he might be armed — " 
Timmins said quickly, but Galt 
brushed that aside. 

“You want to see me?” he asked 
the inturder. 

“That's right,” the man in gray 

IF 



132 




said defiantly. He brushed back 
his hair, straightened his jacket. 
“We’re citizens; we’ve got a right 
to be heard.’’ 

“Who’s ‘we?’ ’’ 

“The Party. ' The young man 
said it flatly, as if inviting chal- 
lenge. 

“Come along to the office," 
Galt said. 

“Frisk them first," he heard 
Timmins say as he turned away. 

There were five people in the 
delegation, three men, two wom- 
en, ranging in age from eighteen 
to thirty-five, Galt estimated. He 
knew them all by sight, two by 
name — not a difficult feat in a 
population of thirty thousand. One 
of the women—a plump, pretty 
girl in nurse’s green— stepped for- 
ward and offered Galt a folded pa- 
per. Timmins, read it over his 
shoulder. 

“The same old refrain," the exec 
said. “Improved public transport, 
more entertainment facilities, 
shorter hours. It’s nonsense — ’’ 

“It’s not nonsense to us," the girl 
said sharply. 

“Or to me either, Miss Dolph,” 
Galt said. “I’d like to lead an eas- 
ier life myself. Unfortunately, 
we can’t afford it — not yet." 

“You’ve got yours," the man in 
gray said. “Official mansion, of- 
ficial car, the best of everything — " 

“Look here," Timmins started, 
but Galt waved a hand to silence 
him. 



“Let’s keep it factual— Jonas, 
isn’t it? My official residence is a 
standard Class Vb unit; I get the 
same food, clothing, and power 
ration as anyone else. As you 
know. As for the car, 1 used to 
walk — until the rock density got a 
bit high." 

“If you were doing your Job the 
way you ought to, nobody would 
be throwing things," Jonas 
snapped. 

“I've got an idea Freddy was at 
the point of bruising you a bit 
when I happened along. Does that 
mean you had it coming to you?" 

“He’s a hired goon — that’s dif- 
ferent." 

“What is it you expect me to do, 
Jonas, Miss Dolph?" 

“Ease the restrictions on life," 
the girl said promptly. “Let peo- 
ple enjoy living while they can. 
Shorten the work day, give us 
some leisure time activities and 
facilities, end rationing, increase 
consumer imports." 

G alt nodded. “Anything 
else?" 

“Plenty morej' Jonas said. 
“End the labor draft. Raise pay, 
right across the board. Lift the off- 
world travel restrictions, bring in 
more outsystem entertainers." 

“For what it cost to open this 
new Sector," another of the dele- 
gation spoke up, a small, timid- 
looking man with a bad complex- 
ion, “we could have founded a

program of concert artists that 
would have given us some contact 
with the cultural life of the Arm/' 

‘‘Sector Nineteen gives us a ma- 
rine agricultural facility," Galt 
said mildly. “In twenty years it 
may be our biggest food pro- 
ducer. We may be able to shorten 
the time to self-support capabil- 
ity by three decades — " 

“We know all the propaganda 
lines/’ Jonas said. “We’ve heard 
all that before." 

“Then what are you doing 
here?’’ Galt snapped. 

That’s easy, Mr. Administra- 
tor,’’ Jonas said with a sneer. “We 
don’t believe the official line." 

“The records are open to the 
public," Galt said. 

“They can be faked, too." 

“Why?" Galt shot back. 

“To delude the public." 

“Why should I want to delude 
the public?" 

“For obvious reasons — " 

“Name them," Galt snapped. 

“All right. To justify your pro- 
gram of overwork and underpay, 
long hours and no recreation, lux- 
ury for the few at the cost of slav- 
ery for the many— " 

“What luxury?" Galt cut in 
sharply. “We’ve already covered 
that particular allegation. It’s 
nonsense and you know it -and so 
does everybody in this room." 

“Look, chief, this has gone far 
enough," Willis started, but Galt 
cut him off. 



“You’re here charging me and 
the rest of the administration with 
a deep, dark plot—’’ 

“You’re depriving the people of 
their basic rights," Jonas shouted. 

“You name one right you’re be- 
ing deprived of, Jonas, and I’ll 
personally see that you get a life- 
time pension," Galt said. 

“All right — the right to a rea- 
sonable amount of leisure time, 
for openers. The eight-hour day 
went out with coal-fired ground 
cars." 

“What would you call a reason- 
able amount of leisure time?" 

“Time enough to do a few 
things. To have hobbies, play a 
musical instrument, visit your 
Triends — " 

“Wrong, Mr. Jonas. That’s nice, 
maybe, but it’s not reasonable. 
Reasonable means what’s phys- 
ically possible. We have just so 
much manpower," he went on, 
raising his voice as Jonas tried to 
cut in. “We have to allocate that 
manpower in such a way as to 
keep industrial operations going 
at the rate required to produce 
enough exportable output to 
keep the economy afloat. You want 
more imported trideos and trav- 
eling art shows? Fine. Then we’ll 
have to work longer hours, not 
shorter." 

“Official bullwash," Jonas spat 
out the words like a bite of wormy 
apple. 

“As 1 said, the records are pub-

lie. Look at them or not, suit your- 
self. But don't come bursting in 
here again with your proposals for 
instant utopia until you've done 
your homework." 

"That's what 1 thought we'd 
get," one of the women said in a 
shrill, nervous voice. "A brush- 
off. Excuses. We should have 
known better than to waste our 
time." She glared at Galt with eyes 
as sharp as stakes. 

"I welcome constructive sug- 
gestions," Galt said, meeting her 
gaze steadily. "Come back when 
you have one." 

"We won't be back," Jonas said. 
"We're through talking." They 
departed, slamming doors, 

EMIND you of anything?" 

-■^Galt asked Timmins when 
silence had fallen again. 

"Painfully. Except that there 
were only fifty of us — " 

"Forty-two," Galt corrected. 

" — and this time half the popula- 
tion is agitating. No one tried to 
explain to us; if they had, we 
might even have listened." 

"Don't count on it. We wanted 
change — any change. We got it." 

"And all the grief that went with 
it. But these people today won't 
listen. They remember when we 
threw BuCol out; Pinchot and a 
few others were promising them 
the world. Twenty years later 
they're still on short rations. 
They're unhappy. And they mean

business, Andy. This isn't just a 
little band of soreheads — " 

"1 know all that, Ben. Are you 
suggesting 1 should promise 
them pie in the sky? What happens 
when they discover it isn't there?" 

Timmons looked solemn. 
"Andy, for this generation— and 
for a lot of people who ought to 
know better — you symbolize 
everything that's wrong with life. 
By removing you, you see, they 
can remove their problems — they 
think." 

"You're suggesting I quit while 
I'm ahead?" 

"I'm suggesting you quit while 
you’re alive, damn it!" 

"And do what? Sit back and 
watch Colmar die?" 

"You've had offers— three in the 
last six months that 1 know of; I 
wrote the answers turning them 
down. You could still take that 
post at Yale, lecturing on prob- 
lems of the frontier economy — " 

"And read in the fax about how 
the Colmar experiment failed. 
Ben, have you ever considered 
what would happen if we had to 
throw in the towel and invite Bu- 
Col back in? They'd close the col- 
ony down, evacuate us to Ter- 
ra— to beehive housing, synthetic 
rations — " 

"I know. It's unthinkable. And 
dammit, Colmar can make it! We 
have the minerals, the seas — a 
whole world to exploit!" Tim- 
mins smacked his fist into his 

135 




palm. “If they could just see it! 
Just give us time!” 

“Bringing life to a dead world is 
a big undertaking, Ben. Maybe 
too big. Maybe we havn’t got what 
it takes. But I have to stay and do 
what I can — for as long as I can.” 

“And be a martyr,” Timmins 
said grimly. 

“There's nothing noble about 
it,” Galt said. “This is my home- 
world. 1 couldn't survive on Terra 
either. I'm fighting for my life; the 
only life I know.” 

“Then don't throw it away. Let 
me recruit an escort for you. I can 
get a dozen TSA regulars detailed 
from Aldo — ” 

“Negative, Ben. Importing for- 
eign gun-handlers to protect me 
from the people that voted me in 
would be the end.'' 

“Then what in God's name are 
you going to do?” 

“Play it by ear — and hope Sec- 
tor Nineteen starts paying off in 
time.” 

“Comes up with a miracle, you 
mean.” 

“I'd accept a miracle right 
now,” Galt said wearily, “if it 
could be arranged.” 

T WO weeks later Timmins laid 
a paper on Galt's desk. It had 
been a time of rising tensions and 
near-riots, broken glass — and at 
least one assassination attempt 
which had put Freddy in the hospi- 
tol with third-degree laser burns. 



“Weinberg, out at Thirteen,” 
Timmins said. “I thought you 
ought to see it.” The executive 
officer’s face was haggard with 
lost sleep. 

Galt scanned the paper. 
“Livestock? Chickens? What the 
devil's he doing out there, start- 
ing a zoo?” 

“Experimental animals,” Tim- 
mins pointed out. “He wants to 
run some kind of tests on them.” 

Galt rubbed his eyes. “He knows 
we're on the shortest meat ration 
since Colonization,” he said wear- 
ily. “I'm surprised at Weinberg. 
Tell him no. Remind him he's out 
there to supplement our protein 
supply, not deplete it. And ask 
him what he's doing about the 
slimemould contamination prob- 
lem he's been reporting on.” 

Timmins nodded and turned to 
go. Galt stopped him before he 
reached the door. 

“Wait a minute, Ben. Disre- 
gard that last outburst. I'm too 
damn tired to think straight. If 
Dick Weinberg thinks he needs a 
flock of goats, damn it, he prob- 
ably needs a flock of goats. Set it 
up--triple — A priority.” 

Timmins nodded again, more 
brightly. 

“And tell them to save a seat on 
the flier for me,” Galt added. “I'm 
going out and see what he's up 
to.” 

Timmins frowned. “That might 
not be a good idea, Andy. There

was rioting at the port this after- 
noon and — ” 

“Set it up/’ Galt snapped, then 
grimaced. “I’m sorry, Ben. 
Nerves. Just get me on the flier. I’ll 
ride out under a stack of old bur- 
lap bags if you say so.” 

“I’ll set it up,” Timmins said 
tonelessly. 

T he view from the cargo flier 
was a monotonous vista of 
eroded ridges, gullied plains, of 
rock, gravel and sand, stretching 
across tli\e endless miles. After the 
narrow green belt of the capital 
had been passed — and its sur- 
rounding five-mile farm strip — 
forty miles of undeveloped des- 
ert intervened before the dull 
green of a bioadapted valley ap- 
peared, far off to the west. An- 
other seventy-five miles of arid, 
lifeless badlands unrolled be- 
neath the flier; then ahead the 
curve of the coast and the black- 
blue sea beyond. They were with- 
in five miles of the Experimental 
Station before Galt could make 
out the fragile tracings of irriga- 
tion ditches, the patterns of agri- 
formed fields, the vivid green specs 
that were transplanted trees shad- 
ing a straggle of buildings. Off- 
shore of the station, Galt noted, 
the lifeless sea was stained a dark 
umber. The flier landed on the 
scraped rectangle behind the 
sprawling, aluminum-and-white 
station. A chill wind blew sand 

THE RIGHTTO RESIST 



across the open ground to ping 
against the flier’s sides with a rest- 
less whispering. 

Weinberg was there to meet 
Galt, a sturdily built, red-haired 
man with big solemn eyes and a 
wide, downcurving mouth that 
belied his brisk optimism of man- 
ner. 

“Glad to see you, Mr. Adminis- 
trator— you bring my goats and 
birds and stuff?” he said, pumping 
Galt’s hand. “Come on out of this 
damned wind.” 

The marine ecologist's office, 
laboratory and living quarters 
comprised a single large untidy 
room with stone countertops, a 
clutter of glassware, a desk 
heaped with papers, a cot, a table 
with a hot-plate and dirty dishes. 

“Here, sit down, Andy, how 
about a cup of coffee and a slice of 
cake?” 

“Dick, what’s this about animal 
experiments? I understand we’re 
going to add seafood to our 
diet — ” 

“Sure, sure. I'll tell you all about 
it. How' re things in the city? I hear 
they’re giving you a hard time, 
throwing rocks, the works.” 

“Things aren’t good. Ben Tim- 
mins says all we need is a small 
miracle from you to solve every- 
thing. You don't happen to have 
one in stock, do you?” 

“A small miracle, the man 
says,” Weinberg said cheerfully, 
rattling cups. He poured, dumped 

137 




things on a tray, brought it over. 
Galt took the cup and sipped, ac- 
cepted the small plate with the 
slice of yellow-brown cake. 

‘‘Where do you get coffee?” he 
barked.‘‘I thought the last stocks of 
luxury imports went last New 
Year’s.” 

“Try the cake. It’s not too 
sweet.” 

Galt took a bite; it tasted good. 
He hadn’t realized how hungry he 
was; but then he hadn’t eaten in- 
how many hours? 

‘‘Like it?” Weinberg looked as 
expectant as a new bride serving 
her first meal. 

“It’s fine, Dick. But — ” 



« A SMALL miracle, the man 
says,” Weinberg said, rub- 
bing his hands together. “Come 
this way, Andy. 1 want to show you 
something.” The ecologist led the 
way through a long room where 
half a dozen green-smocked tech- 
nicians worked over complicat- 
ed constructions of glass tubing 
and containers of bubbling liq- 
uids. A sharp, burnt-toast odor 
filled the air. At the rear of the sta- 
tion Galt and Weinberg emerged 
on a sloping shelf of beach that led 
down to the waterline. Masses of 
dull brown scum lay in long win- 
drows there. The surface of the sea 
was a dark brown, oily-looking, 
with sluggish swells. 

“You remember the problem I 

138 



reported I was having with the 
slime formation,” Weinberg said. 

“1 see it hasn’t improved any,” 
Galt said. “I hope it’s not interfer- 
ing seriously with your work.” 

“Fact is, Andy, I’ve about 
dropped everything to work on it. 
I think I’ve identified it as a mu- 
tated Fuligo Septica, probably 
introduced on some imperfectly 
sterilized glassware from Terra. 
We tried high-pressure steam first, 
but—” 

“Just a minute, Dick. Dropped 
everything?’’ Galt's voice was 
harsh. “Maybe I haven’t succeed- 
ed in making it clear that the mis- 
sion of finding food supplements 
for the Colmarian diet is abso- 
lute top priority—” 

Weinberg looked reproachfully 
at Galt. “Mr. Administrator, 
may I make my presentation?” 
His wide mouth quivered, the 
corners turning upward in spite 
of his obvious effort to hold them 
down. 

“What the devil are you grin- 
ning at?” 

“How did you like the coffee?” 

“Drinkable,” Galt snapped. 
“What—” 

“It’s made from the sporangia 
phase; the stalks, you understand, 
desiccated, ground, and roasted.” 

“You made that coffee out 
of— this?” Galt prodded a mass of 
crusted brown flakes with his toe. 

“Uh-huh. The cake was made 
from the spores, with an admix- 

IF 




tured of piasmodium, plus a sweet- 
ner.” 

'‘Slime cake?’’ Galt said. 

"Of course all this required a 
certain amount of processing. 
We’re running some ideas in glass, 
looking for shortcuts — for com- 
mercial quantity production, you 
understand. But with a little dry- 
ing and compressing, we get 
what, unless I flunked Chem 1, is 
the best all-around livestock feed 
going.’’ He took from his pocket 
a hard, dull-shiny, purple-brown 
cake the size of a bar of soap. 
"Hence the goats,’’ he said. "And 
the chickens.’’ 

Galt stood as if stricken. 
"But — if this is true — ’’ He took a 
deep breath and became brisk. 
"Fine. One miracle to order — ’’ 
His voice broke and he cackled in 
glee. "Dick, you sneaky bastard, 
you’ve just saved a world, damn 
your hide!’’ 

"All in a day’s work, Mr. Ad- 
ministrator — ’’ Weinberg, grin- 
ning, was gazing past Galt toward 
the open desert to the west. "Well, 
more visitors,” he said. "Word 
must have leaked out — ” 

G alt turned; a dust cloud was 
boiling toward them, raised by 
a speeding vehicle. The car swung 
past the station, slid to a halt near 
the storage sheds and was im- 
mediately veiled by the dust of its 
own passage. 

"That looks like one of my 

THE RIGHTTO RESIST 



maintenence carts,” Galt said. 
"What — ” There was a shout. A 
man at the lab door was waving. 

"Call for you, Mr. Administra- 
tor. Sounds urgent.” 

Galt started toward the build- 
ing, Weinberg behind him. Three 
men emerged from the dust cloud 
now blowing away from the car; 
they broke into a run on a course 
that would intercept Galt. Some- 
thing bright flashed in the hand of 
the leader; the flat sound of a gun 
cut the air. Galt threw himself 
down. The man in the doorway 
started out; there was a second 
shot and the technician halted, 
turned, fell sideways. Galt looked 
up to see the second of the new ar- 
rivals knock the gunner’s arm 
aside as he fired a third time, the 
slug whining past Galt’s face. 

—alive,” he heard. "We can al- 
ways kill him later if it works out 
that way.” 

Galt got to his feet. Weinberg 
went to the man who had been 
shot, squatted beside him, ignor- 
ing an angry command from the 
man with the gun. He looked up, 
his face pale and bleak. 

"Pat’s dead,” he said to no one 
in particular. 

The third man stood with his two 
fellows, all three looking dusty 
and windblown, a bit uncertain 
now. The wind whined restlessly. 

"You, Galt, over here,” the gun- 
ner said. "You — ” addressing 
Weinberg — ” stay out of the way 

139 




and you won’t get hurt.” 

Galt walked over to the trio. 
“Proud of yourself, Jonas?” 

Jonas swore and swung at Galt, 
knocked him down. 

“Any guns inside?” Jonas called 
to Weinberg. 

“No.^’ 

“If you’re lying I’ll kill you. Get 
the stuff,” he, said to his compan- 
ions. “I don’t want a stick left of 
this place to salvage.” 

The two went to the car, brought 
out packages Galt recognized as 
standard melt charges. They hur- 
ried toward the entrance to the 
station, went past the corpse 
sprawled on the sand, disap- 
peared inside. An instant later 
there were screams; steam boiled 
from the entrance. A man ran out, 
tatters of what looked like wet 
gauze flapping from his face. He 
stumbled and went down, lay 
thrashing. Galt, still on the 
ground, swung his legs, brought 
Jonas down on top of him. The 
younger man cursed and tried to 
bring the gun to bear; Galt caught 
his wrist, felt the superior strength 
of the other inexorably overcom- 
ing his resistance. 

Suddenly Jonas was thrown 
clear. Weinberg stood over Galt, 
breathing hard. Jonas came to his 
knees and Weinberg swung his 
foot in a short, sharp kick that 
snapped the assassin's head back. 
He sank down on his face in the 
sand. 



Weinberg helped Galt to his feet; 
his knee was painfully wrenched. 
He picked up the gun dropped by 
Jonas. Men were coming out of 
the station, one still holding the 
live steam hose. 

“There’s bad trouble back in the 
city,” one of the men told Galt. “It 
was Mr. Timmins on the box. He 
said you’d better get back right 
away.” 

T he hour was near dusk when 
the copter dropper Galt direct- 
ly on the grounds of Admin 
House, bypassing the noisy crowd 
surrounding the building. Tim- 
mins met him, looking grim. 

“This isn’t just the usual unrest, 
Andy,” he said, “it’s a concerted 
uprising. Mobs at the port, the 
Power Complex — ” he broke off. 
“What happened to you?” 

“I’ve had a sample. A 
demolition team hit the Marine 
Experimental Station, killed 
Pat Rogan. Weinberg is holding 
our old acquaintance Jonas and a 
couple of others.” 

Timmins swore with feeling. 
“They tried to fire the Comm Cen- 
ter about an hour ago. We saved it 
by the skin of our teeth. There are 
enough citizens on our side to 
make it a standoff so far; but kill- 
ing a man — ” 

“Let’s get inside, Ben; I want a 
complete status report.” 

Timmins finished his account 
twenty minutes later. 



140 



IF 




“That’s about it. The best esti- 
mate is three hundred activists, 
another ten thousand going along 
for the ride, ready to jump either 
way. That’s damn near half the 
population. Opposed to them, 
we’ve got a hundred organized 
militia with non-lethal weapons 
and maybe two thousand volun- 
teers with axe-handles and chair 
legs.” 

“Get some cots set up, Ben. It’s 
going to be a long night,” 

“What do you plan to do, 
Andy?” 

“Wait. Maybe by morning 
they’ll have cooled down enough to 
talk sense to. I have some news for 
them.” He outlined the gist of 
Weinberg’s discovery. 

“But this is what we’ve been 
waiting for — even praying for at 
odd moments,’’ Timmins said, 
running his fingers through his 
thinning hair. “Good lord, 
Andy — this is the best news you 
could have brought — ” 

“But nobody out there’s listen- 
ing tonight. Relax, Ben. So far 
we’re holding our own. Maybe 
this will tip it our way.” 

All through the night there were 
reports of fires, quickly quenched, 
roaming bands of slogan-shouting 
looters, clashes between vigilantes 
and demonstrators which petered 
out indecisively. The hours passed. 
Galt dozed. Pale light was filtering 
through the windows when he was 
awakened by a man who burst into 

THE RIGHTTO RESIST 



the office, without the formality 
of knocking. “They’ve fired the li- 
brary,” he said. “A crowd of them 
got inside the kindergarten, too. 
Shall we try to hold it?” 

“Let it go,” Timmins snapped. 
“We’ve got to concentrate on es- 
sential installations.” He broke 
off. “Sorry, Andy. It’s your deci- 
sion, of course:” 

“I agree. What are they really 
after, Ben What’s their prime tar- 
get?” 

“What do you think?” Timmins 
snapped. “Admin House. If they 
get in here — ” 

A MUFFLED explosion in the 
near distance punctuated the 
remark. Objects rattled on the 
desk. Somewhere there was a 
sound of breaking glass. Galt 
whirled to the window. Smoke was 
billowing from a point near the 
main gate, which was twisted off 
its mountings. Men came stream- 
ing through the opening in a 
ragged spearhead. 

“Where are our, militiamen?” 
Timmins yelled and left the room 
at a run. Shouts sounded from the 
downstairs, accompanied by 
heavy thuddings. Galt arrived in 
the foyer to find a dozen volun- 
teer defenders, all of them smoke- 
smudged and bleeding from small 
cuts and abrasions, grouped be- 
hind the massively barred doors. 

“They’re starting to get rough,” 
one of the men called. “They’ve got 

141 




guns— a dozen of them anyway. 
God only knows where they got 
them. Nobody killed yet far as I 
know, but that explosion they set 
off—” 

The pounding at the heavy doors 
ceased abruptly. Voices could be 
heard beyond the heavy panels, 
shouting over the rumble of crowd 
noises. 

“We’re in a hopeless position,” 
a man said. “We’ve done all we 
could — these hoodlums mean 
business. I say let’s get out while 
we can.” 

“Dammit, you can’t run away 
now — ’’ Timmins began. 

“Go ahead, Jacobs,” Galt cut in, 
“Anybody who wants to leave 
now, make it fast, Thanlcs for your 
help,” 

All but two of the volunteers de- 
parted hastily, some silently, 
some with apologies, A chant had 
started up outside the doors, 

“What the devil are they shout- 
ing?” Timmins said. 

“Give— us — Galt!" the chant 
came through clearly in a mo- 
mentary lull in the background 
roar. “Give — us — Galt” 

“The damned murderous 
swine,” Timmins cried. “Andy, 
you’ve got to get out. They want a 
scapegoat, somebody to blame - 
and you're elected," 

Galt shook his head; he went up 
the stairs to the landing. From the 
narrow window there he could see 
the drama spread out before him: 

142 



the ruined gate, the ragged crowd 
of rebels fanning out from it, 
forming a loose arc fifty feet from 
the steps; the packed mob beyond 
the walls, craning for a better 
look. 

“Like ghouls, watching a 
beheading,” Timmins said be- 
side him. “Don’t the damn fools 
know if these anarchists get inside 
it’s all over for Colmar?” 

“Don’t blame them; they’re just 
ordinary citizens caught in some- 
thing outside their scope. They’re 
waiting for leadership — any 
leadership.” Galt glanced at Tim- 
mins. “And if we can’t give it to 
them, somebody else will.” He 
"pointed to the tall man standing 
front and center, with a bandolier 
of cartridges slung over his shoul- 
der, a heavy power rifle gripped in 
a brawny fist. 

“A malcontent named Brauer,” 
Timmins said. “By God, if 1 had a 
gun—’’ He looked at Galt, dropped 
his eyes to the pistol in Gault’s 
belt. “Let me borrow that, Andy," 
he said in a low, intense voice. “1 
can drop him with one shot." 

Galt shook his head. “You know 
better than that, Ben.” 

“If killing one man will stop 
this — I say it's justified.” 

“I’d probably agree with you — if 
one killing would stop it. The fact 
is, we’d be giving them a 
martyr— shot from ambush. I 
think I know which way the crowd 
would go then.” He turned and 

IF 




went back down the stairs. 

"‘Open it up," he said to the two 
men waiting beside the big doors. 

“Mr. Administrator, you can’t 
surrender to that mob," one of 
the men blurted. “They'll skin you 
alive. That's all they want." 

“Who's surrendering? Get that 
door open." 

O VER the protests of Timmins, 
men withdrew the locking 
bars, swung the portals wide. A 
sound went up from the crowd as 
Galt stepped out on the portico; it 
faded quickly as the big man 
named Brauer stepped forward. 
He stood for a moment, fingering 
the gun in his hands; then he turned 
and called over his shoulder: 

“Let's go; the rats are throwing 
in their hand." He started for- 
ward, walking with a defiant 
swagger, all eyes on him. Those 
directly behind him followed; 
the crowd edged forward, sliding 
silently through the gate, spread- 
ing out. Brauer came on. When he 
was six feet away, Galt flipped 
back his jacket to expose the pistol 
thrust into his belt, dropped his 
hand to the butt. Brauer stopped 
dead. A number of expressions 
crossed his face; surprise, anger, 
determination. His eyes narrowed. 
The rifle in his hands started to 
come up. 

“Throw that gun down or I'll put 
a bullet between your eyes, 
Brauer," Galt said quietly. 

THE RIGHTTO RESIST 



Brauer froze. He glanced at 
Galt's face, at his chin, his belt 
buckle. 

“You crazy, Galt? he asked “Get 
out of my way—" 

“Five seconds," Galt said. 

"You want to get killed?" 
Brauer burst out. 

“Four," Galt said. “Three. 
Two—" 

With an oath, Brauer threw 
down the gun. A murmur went up 
from the crowd. A man behind 
Brauer started forward. 

"Get back in line," Galt 
snapped. The man halted. 

“Drop the bandolier, Brauer," 
Galt ordered. Brauer complied. 
He looked up at Galt, his face 
slowly turning red. 

“Come inside," Galt said. “1 
want to talk to you." The big'man 
stood fast. “Move, 1 told you!" 
Galt snapped. Brauer attempted a 
cocky smile; it became a sickly 
grimace. He went up the steps. 
Galt followed him inside. When 
he glanced back from the door, the 
crowd was already melting away. 

“You can't get away with this," 
Brauer was saying. "We don't 
have to stand for this—" 

“1 think you will," Galt said. 

"We've got rights!" Brauer 
yelled. “The power belongs to the 
people!" 

“That's right," Galt said. “I 
agree you're under no obligation 
to support the government just 
because it's there." 



143 




“Well, then — “ Brauer started. 

“Certainly, you have a right to 
revolt,’' Galt went on. “But that 
dosn’t mean I'm under any obli- 
gation to let you get away with it." 

<tWHAT I can't understand," 
▼ ▼ Timmins said an hour la- 
ter, after the militia had reported 
all quiet in the city, “is why you 
let him get so close before you 
stopped him." 

“Simple," Galt said. “I couldn't 



hit the wide side of a warehouse 
with a pistol unless the muzzle 
was touching it.” He smiled. 
“Brauer made the same mistake in 
judgment Blum did — they both let 
me get too close. And when we 
started talking — I had the better 
argument. Brauer agreed he would 
have made a lousy administra- 
tor.” He yawned. “Tomorrow 
we'll announce Weinberg's dis- 
covery — and a new plan for Col- 
mar’s economy.’’ •

on. Whenever the future be- 
comes the present — as it must do 
constantly — we are not prepared 
to cope with it. 

A hundred years ago there was 
no great problem. A man who had 
all his thoughts frozen at the 1850 
level was not going to be pro- 
foundly shocked by anything im- 
pinging on his daily life for the rest 
of the century. Oh, he saw an 
occasional automobile and heard 
that the Wrights had learned to 
build a machine that flew. But 
such things came into the world 
slowly and did not put too great 
demands on him. For him the fu- 
ture never really arrived; he lived 
in a sort of eternal present, where 
the verities were indeed fixed. 

Today, the future has been with 
us for a quarter of a century. The 
man who returned from World 



( Continued from page 2) 

War II was faced with radical 
changes. Television came into his 
home; while it entertained, it also 
presented a whole world to him, 
much of which stubbornly re- 
fused to accept his exact values. 
The atom bomb had been ex- 
ploded and racial extinction, was 
now possible — as well as injury to 
his children from fallout. Those 
dratted scientific ideas had be- 
come part of his mental environ- 
ment — and of his taxes. And to- 
day, all his fixed values are being 
shaken to tatters. The younger 
generation — grown in a present 
that vanishes from them as they 
learn it, but a present thirty years 
from Mr. Establishment's world, 
or thirty years in his mental fu- 
ture — all think and talk in ways 
that world finds nearly impossible 
to follow. 



144 




In another twenty years the fu- 
ture may well have wrenched this 
younger generation even more 
severely. The changes from their 
1965 conditioning are already 
major. We now face such phenom- 
ena as pollution, for which noth- 
ing in their books can offer an 
answer. They generally are already 
falling back on a failure to adapt 
that takes the form of demanding 
their hopeless elders do something 
about it. And they are confronted 
with a world that is already gross- 
ly overpopulated for a technical 
age; that was supposed to be a 
problem for the year 2000, but 
it turned out it was for the year 
1930! 

Man is a reasonably adaptive 
animal. But the demands for 
adaptation are no longer reason- 
able, as most people see them. 
With the accelerating rate of 
change a human being today 
(who should reevaluate every- 
thing he knows about living at 
least once a decade) is going to 
face the need to rethink all his 
values and solutions at least once a 
year. That requirement of an- 
nual change is too severe a de- 
mand for the average homo sapi- 
ens to face. Even now, the need 
for change has resulted in severe 
shock reaction that manifests it- 
self in many of the social ills of 
our time. 

Toffler goes on to document his 
case and to examine what we must 



expect during the rest of this cen- 
tury. Ke considers the inability of 
our institutions to deal with the 
problems and tries to explore 
what must be done to let us meet 
the test of survival. It is an im- 
portant and valuable book, well 
worth careful reading. 

Yet the one solution that seems 
to have worked to some extent so 
far is hardly covered, for rather 
obvious reasons. And that solu- 
tion, it seems to me, may be the 
long-range reading of science fic- 
tion! At least, from my own ob- 
servations, the steady readers of 
our literature seem to be far 
readier to cope with a changing fu- 
ture than most other people and I 
find very little real future shock 
among my friends in the field. 

Science fiction, after all, does 
not deal with the future (as Fred- 
erik Pohl has pointed out repeat- 
edly). It deals with any and every 
future. Each major story in the 
field sets up a different future in 
many ways and looks for solutions 
to meet the conditions in that fu- 
ture. As readers, we spend our 
time playing a constant game of 
fairy chess, where the rules change 
from game to game and often with- 
in the game. 

The average man doesn’t really 
believe there is a future — ^just an 
eternal present through which he 
will drift to his end. But science fic- 
tion readers have often become 
more future-oriented than present- 

145

adjusted. (That has its troubles, 
too, but apparently less severe 
ones.) And since they deal in pos- 
sible futures, rather than the seem- 
ingly probable one, they are quite 
accustomed to having to reorient 
themselves every time they sit 
down to look at the future. 

In a world of unfixed and 
changing values the man who has 
made a game of thinking outside 
the seeming values of his present 
is clearly the mam who will find 
any radical alteration far less 
shocking. 

Incidentally, that would seem to 
indicate that those who want 
science fiction to deal with pres- 
ent problems and situations are 
totally wrong; there aren’t going to 
be any present problems and sit- 
uations— by the time tomorrow 
gets here, the future will have 
jumped ten tomorrows ahead and 
be in the past. It may be that the 
less science fiction concerns itself 
with the real world (as we know it), 
the more useful it will be. 



I N THAT case — in fact, in any 
case — one of the ‘'must” books 
is Philip Jose Farmer’s To Your 
Scattered Bodies Go (Putnam’s 
Sons, $4.95). This deals with a fu- 
ture which almost certainly isn’t 
going to happen, but one in which 
a lot of the rigid values are tossed 
aside for a logic inherent in the 
story, yet just out of the reader’s 

146 



full comprehension. It sounds wild, 
and it is; but it's an excellent 
exercise in building mental flex- 
ibility, as well as a pleasure to read. 

This is the first of a series which 
will deal with the “Riverworld.” 
Much of this book was run in the 
form of novelettes in //"previously, 
but it is now reshaped into a novel, 
and well worth reading in its en- 
tirety. 

Riverworld is apparently some 
kind of artificial planet designed 
to accommodate an Ouriborus 
river that winds back and forth 
through multiple valleys, to meet 
itself and resume its journey. 
And to this world, all the human 
beings who have ever died — from 
the first Eanthropus to the men 
who died when the race was exter- 
minated— are returned to life. 
They are partly clumped by simi- 
larity of era and area, but about 
10% are randomized, so that dawn- 
men and even aliens may be mixed 
with our current types. 

They don’t know how or why all 
this has happened. It fits no es- 
tablished religious pattern. And 
since they are dumped onto this 
world with no artifacts normal to 
them, it fits directly almost no 
social pattern. They are given a 
source of food — and drugs for 
those who want — so that this is a 
sort of welfare world; but beyond 
that minimum they have almost 
nothing. 

In addition they find that death 

IF 




has not only been defeated, but 
has been repealed. Oh, a man can 
be killed, with all the suffering of 
normal death. On this world, where 
everything seems to be returning 
to tribal moralities, there is a lot 
of the ancient bloody war and kill- 
ing from the history of man. But 
shortly after a man dies, he ap- 
pears again somewhere along the 
river. He may die a hundred times 
or more and still go on. 

It’s a wild and lovely idea, filled 
with impossibilities that only 
Farmer would have the courage to 
try to write. Any other writer I 
know, if he were clever enough to 
think of the basic idea, would have 
abandoned it as too big and too 
shapeless to turn into a novel. But 
for Farmer it works. 

In fact, it worked long ago when 
he was just beginning as a writer. 
This was a story that he must have 
written around 1950. It was then a 
single, huge novel. He offered it 
in a prize contest one of the fan- 
publishing groups was running 
and it won. Then, for complicated 
reasons, it was never published 
nor did Farmer collect the prize to 
which he was entitled. But like the 
characters in his novel, the story 
was killed only to appear again in 
another situation. 

It was apparently too long for 
serialization. But eventually 
Farmer reworked it into a series of 
novelettes, so that part of it came 
out in magazine form, consid- 

READING ROOM 



erably altered from the original. 

How much alteration that en- 
tailed, I do not know. I was once 
given the original form to deliver 
to the office in New York. So, for 
a brief period, I saw the early form 
of the novel; but there wasn’t time 
enough even to skim it. That is 
something 1 greatly regret. Had 
I known that the manuscript was 
available. I’d have dropped every- 
thing to read it, but the first version 
had to pass through my hands un- 
read, damn the luck. 

1 gather that the series now be- 
ginning to appear from Putnam’s 
is a further reworking. 

This volume is basically the od- 
yssey of Richard Burton after his 
revival on Riverworld. In that 
sense it forms a complete story, 
though much of the deeper thread 
behind it all remains uncovered. 
I dislike being left up in the air, 
but at least history is being pre- 
sented fairly. Putnam has an- 
nounced it as the first of the 
group, and it reaches a resolution 
of Burton’s development, without 
introducing any artificial false 
ending or leaving us on a cliff- 
hanger. And maybe I’m just so 
glad to see it appearing that I’m 
kinder to this example of split-up 
publishing than I might other- 
wise be. 

The riddle of how and why is a 
constant tantalizer in the book. 
Burton has reason — and ap- 
parently for some reason, at 

147 




that — to know that there are 
sentient beings behind it all. They 
have deliberately created River- 
world and managed to revive 
everyone who lived. He cannot 
know why they are doing all this. 
He knows also that they have some 
kind of spies among the revived 
humans. One of them apparently 
is a traitor to the others, which is 
why Burton was allowed to learn 
more of the behind-the-scenes 
activity than the others. But be- 
yond trying to reach the head (or 
foot, since they are the same) of the 
river where the planners seem to 
have their secret headquarters, he 
can do nothing but attempt in his 
own logical way to avoid their dis- 
covering him. 

It’s a complicated setup. Until 
the books are filially all published 
I can’t be sure how well the rami- 
fications are worked out. But the 
promise behind the premise is 
wonderful. And even if the end 
should turn out not quite to justify 
the means, the means are good 
enough for me to settle for them. 

There is a weakness in the book, 
of course, as there is to almost any 
work that involves so difficult a 
concept. The principal one seems 
to me to be the use of known char- 
acters. We have Richard Burton, 
who was truly a fantastic human 
being in real life; he was the trans- 
lator of the Arabian Nights and a 
great adventurer. We also have 
Hermann Goering and the woman 

148 



for whom Alice in Wonderland 
was written. She comes through 
very well, but the historicity of the 
others bothers me in reading their 
fictional life here. Button, as fic- 
tion, makes a fine hero for the 
book; but I find him overshadowed 
by references to what seems to me 
a larger reality. Goering has all his 
weaknesses — but again, the 
strengths and oddly distorted but 
real Junker code of the historical 
figure do not quite fit this picture. 
Farmer’s research is sound — but 
the real figures just don’t seem 
capable of being fitted well into 
this box. The wholly imaginary 
ones always seem to come off bet- 
ter. 



T he Daleth Effect, by Harry 
Harrison (Berkley, 75^) is a 
totally different type of book. 
Here the means are standard — the 
end seems to be everything. The 
author uses a method of getting 
space travel without the vast sums 
possible only to a major nation 
to set up his theme: what man will 
do with his ability. 

To me, this is a curious book; it 
kept irritating me because it 
recalled another I had read some 
time previously. This was a story 
by Arthur Sellings about a 
whacky professor who found a 
means to get cheap space flight and 
then had to run from pillar to post 
to convince the world — then to es- 



IF 




cape the world and to end up giv- 
ing Israel the first successful use 
of his discovery. Harrison’s book 
begins as if he’d also read the Sell- 
ings story and then decided to be 
as severely logical and honest 
about the real consequences as 
possibhi. 

I’m not suggesting that Harrison 
copied anything; far from it. He 
has simply taken a similar basic 
idea and then gone beyond it, very 
well indeed. 

In this book the inventor de- 
veloped a vaguely similar effect 
to cheapen space flight in Israel, 
but felt that country too much in- 
volved in its own political struggle, 
to make proper use of his discov- 
ery. He takes it to Den- 
mark — only to find that politics 
and the struggle for power follow 
wherever power may lodge. This is 
a story of the intrigue behind a 
major discovery, as well as the 
story of what adventures and de- 
velopments may come from a 
basic discovery. And in follow- 
ing through, Harrison’s logic is 
severe and honest. 

It isn’t always a pleasant book. 
The adventure part of it lives up 
to all of Harrison’s proven ability 
to do a fine story of this kind. But 
there is little of the release from 
tension in the end, and almost 
none of the humor that he some- 
times handles so well. This isn’t 
that kind of a story. 

This definitely isn’t “escape” fic- 

READING ROOM 



tion, unless you want to escape 
into the world that is too much 
with us. But it does give us another 
view of our time and place and a 
further example of what future 
shock really can accomplish. It’s 
also a good book — excellent in its 
own terms, which is all we can ask. 

T he Leaves of Time, by Neal 
Barrett, Jr. (Lancer, 75^) is un- 
fortunately far less than it should 
be in terms of the author’s pre- 
viously demonstrated ability. The 
work shows us another and inter- 
esting type of future, but then 
seems to go into some kind of 
shock within itself and turn its 
back on the reality it has begun to 
explore. 

Basically, a man from a world of 
possibilities somewhat like those 
on our own is thrown into another, 
differently oriented world. On his 
world, aliens who can control men 
and simulate real humans have 
virtually taken over the planet; 
his jump from world to world is 
caused by a last-ditch battle — and 
one alien is thrown across with 
him. 

His problem is that the alien im- 
mediately begins trying to take 
over the new world. (Aliens can 
fission, thus one can populate a 
planet in time.) He finds he likes 
the new world; he feels respon- 
sible and sets out to warn the new 
world and try to save it. 

The plot so far is all right; but 

149 




unfortunately the really good part 
of this novel is the promise at the 
beginning. Here we meet our first 
inhabitant in the form of a girl 
who can know at once when a man 
is telling the truth. The probability- 
world involved has developed a 
philosophy that gives the students 
quite remarkable powers, and 
we're led to expect that the whole 
world will react differently to the 
alien, the Gorgon. Those bits of 
what this world and its people 
might be like are fascinating. It's a 
world I'd like to know more about. 

Then nothing really comes of it. 
We see even more petty political 
folderol here than on a world with- 
out the philosophy. We see people 
who can know truth "'from false- 
hood at once being as silly as any- 
one else. We see the great leader of 
the philosophy being duped like 
anyone else. In fact, we're told the 
world is different from ours — but 
we're shown quite the reverse, 
while the story degenerates into a 
who-is-the-alien thing, to which the 
answer is patently obvious — so 
patently that we can only assume 
the great students of the philoso- 
phy are no better than the worst 
among us. 

It's a pity, because there was a 
kernel here that showed great 
promise. It's still not a bad book, 
but unfortunately it isn't the good 
one it could be. 

And it shows many appalling ex- 
amples of the bad editing always 

150 



totally inexcusable but which I’ve 
seen too often. In the top para- 
graph of page 73, for instance, 
we’re told that “. she intended 
the gift for he and Tai . with 
both he and Tai expected for din- 
ner. 

Yes, Virginia, English does have 
an accusative case for its pro- 
nouns! After a preposition, the 
object of that preposition al- 
ways takes the accusative, even 
when coupled with a noun. If the 
writer wrote it wrong, any com- 
petent editor would change it. 
After all, there is such a thing as 
reader shock, too. And I'm 
shocked when I find such gauche- 
ries in the basic use of the one tool 
writers and editors must use well— 
the English language. 

Maybe our academic minds 
should stop worrying about the 
purpose of fiction and the evils of 
"'escape literature"; they might 
better spend it trying to instil 
elementary respect for the lan- 
guage, since that does have a real 
and evident purpose. It's also one 
area where the future won't bring 
too many Jarring new discoveries 
to shock them — unless they let it 
degenerate too rapidly. 

Or has the language changed in a 
sudden new arrival of the future 
and am 1 unable to adapt to it 
quickly enough? Maybe I'm in fu- 
ture shov^i , too, despite my read- 
ing of science fiction. Enough, I've 
got to consult Alvin Toffler again.#

LEE HARDING 




M ATTARO knew that it had 
been an accident — the ship 
would never have abandoned him 
intentionally. But knowing this was 
no way out of his predicament. By 
now the Star Wind would be many 
millions of miles away and he could 
not anticipate any rescue from 
that direction. 

He was lucky to be alive. The 
ship had accelerated suddenly— 
and without any prior warning or 
due regard for his safety — and the 
spatial concussion had thrown him 
an enormous distance away from 
the rear Doppler turrets that had 
been the object of his routine in- 



spection. He had tumbled through 
space for hundreds of miles before 
the miniature computer inside his 
cumbersome suit had managed to 
stabilize him in a safe orbit around 
the beautiful green world that 
turned underneath him, and when 
he recovered consciousness he 
felt sick and confused. 

His initial reaction was one of 
intense fear and a horror of what 
might become of him; but eventu- 
ally his rigid training and function- 
al discipline reasserted themselves 
and he found that he could con- 
template the future with a cooler 
eye. 



152 




He was surprised that his suit 
had survived the catastrophe. He 
fervently thanked the engineers 
who had designed and manu- 
factured the monstrous and some- 
times awkward exoskeleton and 
began to check out its functions. 
The small computer bank set 
immediately in front of his chest 
was operating smoothly enough — 
otherwise he would still be tum- 
bling head over heels through 
space instead of drifting in a 
stable orbit around the bright 
young world below. He cautiously 
moved his arms and legs and felt 
the enormous limbs of the suit 



respond and duplicate his move- 
ments; there were no signs of strain 
or delay in the mechanical opera- 
tions of the suit. A few judicious 
bursts from the maneuvering jets 
convinced him that they, too, were 
functioning smoothly. He eased 
off the manual controls and 
allowed the computer to edge him 
back into orbit. He listened to it 
cluck contentedly to itself and 
considered his predicament. 

He disconnected most of the 
neural sensors from his body and 
tried to relax. There was ample 
room inside the suit for him to feel 
unencumbered; he could flex his 



153 



limbs and move the upper half of 
his body quite freely within the 
restraining webs that cushioned 
his fragile body from external 
shocks and minor impacts. He had 
not yet begun to panic, but for 
some reason he could not pin 
down he felt cold. He shivered and 
felt afraid. There was no logical 
reason why he should feel such a 
physical chill: the insulation was 
working perfectly and his suit 
seemed to be in excellent shape. 
So far so good. 

Perhaps it was the unaccustom- 
ed isolation that brought about this 
sudden flutter of his pale flesh. He 
had never before felt so much 
alone, so unspeakably deserted. 
Gone was the warmth"^and com- 
panionship of his unit. Now all he 
had for a friend was the forever 
wise and quietly clucking com- 
puter in his suit. 

"‘All right, then, little lady," he 
sighed. "'Let’s see if you can get me 
out of this mess — " 

H e had enough air to last 
him for seven and a half hours, 
for several circuits of the world be- 
low. At the end of that time he 
would suffer a terrifying death; his 
suit would become a lonely coffin, 
orbiting until such time as it 
swung so low that the atmosphere 
claimed it and transformed it into 
fiery incandescence. 

Mattero’s suit was only a 
standard maintainance unit, a 



smaller version of the enormous 
locomotive machines that could 
carry a man across hostile alien 
landscapes at considerable speed 
and protect him from atmospheres 
that could soon corrupt his pallid 
human flesh; it had very little to 
offer in the way of sophisticated 
survival gear. It had never been 
meant to move very far away from 
the immediate vicinity of the ship. 

A less intelligent spaceman 
would have remained in orbit until 
his small reserve of air gave out, 
hoping with his last breath that the 
Star Wind would arrive back in 
time to save him; but Mattaro 
knew that no ship could ever con- 
template the expenditure of time 
and energy that would be required 
if it were to turn around and come 
back to locate a solitary, mislaid 
crewman. Mattaro belonged to 
Maintainance — he was a cog 
among cogs — and while no one 
could ever openly be considered 
expendable, the loss of one small 
unit could be readily absorbed. 
Whatever urgent business had 
spurred the Star Wind hastily to 
complete its survey of the colonial 
world below and move off with- 
out first making sure that her hull 
was clear of maintainance units, 
would also guarantee that the ship 
could hardly turn back and come 
looking for him, always assuming 
that his disappearance had been 
registered with the Master Con- 
trol. 



154 



IF 




Equally, a less intelligent space- 
man might have lacked sufficient 
courage to embark upon the 
desperate gamble which Mattarp, 
with his computer’s ready agree- 
ment, had decided to commit him- 
self. 

Mattaro was logical enough to 
realize that his only chance lay in 
trying to reach the world below. 
The computer had decided that, 
with a good measure of luck, he 
might make a safe landing on one 
of the wide continents that turned 
underneath his monstrous un- 
moving feet. Enough power was 
left in his suit batteries to permit 
a reasonably fast descent — no 
point in endangering his life any 
further by taking it leisurely and 
using up more of his vital oxygen 
than was necessary. Once he was 
safely down he would need every 
ounce of reserve air that he could 
manage so that he might reach 
some habitation before it finally 
gave out. 

The computer would brake his 
fall at the very last minute. It 
would send a powerful surge of 
energy from the batteries into the 
gray coils wrapped around his exo- 
waist and quickly nullify the 
planet's attraction. Mattaro knew 
that this entailed great risk, but 
he believed that with judicious 
conversation of his available 
power he just might make a safe 
landing and the computer en- 
dorsed his decision. So, if the suit 

FALLEN SPACEMAN 



nursed him down and saved most 
of its remaining energy for a 
single, powerful blast of repulsion 
at the very end of his fall— he just 
might come out of this alive. 

The alternative was unthink- 
able. Better a quick, fiery death 
than a slow orbit into insanity. At 
least this way he could retain some 
semblence of dignity, up to and in- 
cluding the very end //he failed to 
accomplish the desired descent. 

He had no idea how he would 
make out once he was on the 
ground. He knew that this world 
was inhabited, that the Star Wind 
had been locked in orbit for 
several days while its scientists 
studied the visible results of a seed- 
ing program which his people had 
instigated many centuries earlier; 
but beyond this he knew nothing. 
Mattaro was a specialist con- 
versant with every facet of his 
trade — and with very little else. 
Such was the nature of his time and 
his people. What he knew of the 
people who had colonized the fresh 
young world below had only been 
ascertained from ship's gossip. He 
knew that they existed on a 
relatively primitive scale: their 
society' was agrarian and widely 
scattered and there had been, so 
far, no outside interference in 
their affairs. And this was the sum 
of his knowledge. But he felt con- 
fident that the biological sensors 
in his. suit would enable the com- 
puter to set him down reasonably 

155 




close to some sort of habita- 
tion — as to how he would make out 
afterward he had no idea. He 
would have to play it by ear. The 
important thing was first to get 
down. 

Some day, years from now, a 
ship might pass close by this world 
and, if luck would have it, they 
would have been made aware of his 
disappearence and might even 
dispatch a small skiff to see if they 
could find some trace of him. 

Some day. That could be ages 
from now. And in the meantime 
he had to survive. 

It was with a growing sense of 
urgency that he instructed the 
computer to begin the descent. 

H e fell for what seemed 
like ages but in actuality 
amounted to a few short hours. The 
world underneath his enormous 
articulated legs became clearer. 
He entered the upper limits of the 
atmosphere and the dark night of 
space changed color abruptly. The 
nearby sun kindled the air around 
him until it glowed with a 
tantalizing blueness he found quite 
strange. He flexed his limbs inside 
the suit and felt the exoskeleton 
respond. He was confident that all 
would be well. 

The air inside the suit became 
hot. 

‘Take it easy," he warned. “I 
can’t take too much of this." 

The suit slowed slightly. Mat- 



taro began to sweat. It was a pro- 
cess alien to his conditioning and 
it alarmed him to realize that his 
body cells were recalling such an 
archaic function. The grav coils 
continued to throw out a small 
measure of power and he grew 
alarmed when he saw how much 
this token resistance was draining 
his batteries. He concluded — and 
the computer quickly veri- 
fied — that he hadn’t escaped the 
concussion of the Star Wind*s de- 
parture as, well as he had imagined: 
a small but continuous energy 
drain was going somewhere that 
might well prove disastrous. 

Oh, my Mother, why hast thou 
forsaken me? 

His normally placid pulse rate 
quickened. He began to panic. 

An ocean yawned underneath 
him. 

"Not there!’’ he screarned. 
"Find some habitation — quickly!" 

The computer struggled to 
oblige but already the energy drain 
had reached dangerous propor- 
tions. 

He was three miles up and fall- 
ing rapidly, the computer jealous- 
ly withholding as much power as 
it could safely risk for the last few 
seconds of the terrifying descent. 

It was so hot inside the suit he 
could hardly breathe. 

Now he was inland and falling 
at a steep angle toward a densely 
populated forest. The world be- 
low looked green, luxuriant and 



156 



IF 




very frightening. There were no 
signs of human habitation. 

Would he ever make it alive? 

Two miles. 

One. 

Falling faster all the time, the 
wind tearing at his suit like a 
howling banshee. 

Mother, help me! Vm going to 
die. I dont want to die . out 
here . like this! 

Where were the shining cities his 
people had spun between the stars, 
the magic wonderlands he had 
known as a child? Where was the 
beauty of all the things he had ever 
known and loved? 

Gone. 

There was only this crawling 
world at his feet with some offer of 
hope; this clumsy ball of mud and 
water lumbering around a parent 
sun tike some bemused and 
indolent child; this virgin world 
fresh from the furnaces of space 
which man, in his curiosity, had 
sown with his own seed and stood 
back in the shadows of the cen- 
turies to observe. 

For the first time in all his long 
and precisely ordered life Mattaro 
became conscious of what living 
really meant to him. For a mo- 
ment his eyes widened with some- 
thing close to horror, like the eyes 
of one who has seen a vision and is 
incapable of acting upon what he 
has seen; then his mind snapped 
cruelly back to the present. 

He was now descending verti- 

FALLEN SPACEMAN 



cally and at a frightful rate toward 
a small clearing in the forest. The 
computer waited until his feet 
were only a few hundred feet away 
from the tops of the trees before it 
fed the full remaining power into 
the grav coils. 

The suit shuddered and rocked 
like a thing gone mad as it fought 
to decelerate and repulse the 
gigantic mass of the world below. 
The suddea application of energy 
sent the monstrous suit dancing 
and jiggling across the sky; it 
shook Mattaro’s body so much 
that, in spite of the protective web- 
bing that held his body in thrall, he 
thought it might crack open like an 
eggshell and spill his mortal in- 
sides all over the controls. The 
computer struggled to stabilize 
these wild gyrations and bring the 
suit safely down to the surface of 
the planet. 

He almost made it. The repul- 
sion field had evened itself out and 
he had begun to drop towards the 
clearing again. He could see the 
topmost branches of the tallest 
trees moving past his faceplate 
and he began to relax. His night- 
mare was over. And he had even 
begun to smile — a little hysteri- 
cally — when the power finally gave 
out. 

He fell like Icarus. 

^^HE fishing had been bad all 
^ day, so Jarvis had withdrawn 
from this commitment and had 

157 




sprawled out beside the stream, 
his arms behind his head, and had 
contented himself with a little 
doze and a modicum of thought. 
He had wedged his rod into a 
convenient tree stump by the wa- 
ter’s edge and left the line drifting 
casually downstream; if a fish 
proved foolish enough to go for his 
lure a small bell attached to the 
float would summon him from 
sleep. But the sun was warm and 
encouraged idleness and he had 
only caught two miserably small 
fish all morning. 

A small pouch of wine lay beside 
him, some sliced rolls and some 
sausage in a wooden basket, and 
that was what fishing was really all 
about. He had eaten rribst of the 
food and drunk a goodly measure 
of the wine when he was roused 
from his slumber by something he 
could not understand. 

Then he saw the dark speck high 
in the clear sky and heard the high- 
pitched, keening cry that seemed 
to accompany its fall. It grew 
from a dot the size of a bird into 
something gigantic and terrifying 
and out of place and- his mind — a 
little dulled by the amount of 
warm wine he had quaffed— was 
slow to react. 

Jarvis was no longer young. The 
sun had tanned his wrinkled skin a 
deep shade of brown and his brow 
was heavy with the burden of years. 
He had lost count of the seasons 
he had walked through and his 

158 



mind, like his limbs, had lost a 
good deal of vigor. But he had 
never before seen an object like 
this falling out of the heavens— 
and its probable point of impact 
would seem to be only a short 
distance away on the other side of 
the stream. 

He sat up, startled, and 
scrambled to his feet as the object 
grew large in the sky and fell to- 
ward the ground at an incredible 
pace. His fishing was forgotten 
while he stood, transfixed and 
spellbound. When the thing was 
almost at the point of crashing in- 
to the upper levels of the forest it 
shuddered suddenly and came to a 
halt in mid-air. Next it performed 
an insane jig across the sky, 
dancing about over the top of the 
trees like something gone mad. 
Jarvis took a step backward and 
nearly lost his balance. He could 
see it clearly now — and he did not 
like what he saw. Its general shape 
was that of a man and it. flung its 
limbs about in a grotesque parody 
of a man possessed. 

It stilled. Jarvis watched, open- 
mouthed, as it glided across the 
tree tops — toward him. 

He backed away. The creature 
looked like something fetched from 
a nightmare conjured up by the 
foulest home brew imaginable. He 
prepared his skinny legs to run 
and just as he was about to turn 
and thrust them into frantic 
motion — the thing fell. 



IF 




It crashed down through the 
forest as though it weighed several 
tons. He could hear it tearing a 
pathway through the tightly 
packed branches: a terrible 

screeching sound such as a 
moHySter might make, fighting for 
its life. The sound of the impact 
was thunderous and the ground 
shook as the creature tumbled to 
it, unseen. 

A flock of birds rose screaming 
from the scene of the impact. For 
a while they circled wildly around 
the great rent in the trees, calling to 
each other in agitation, then they 
flew off and dispersed. A lazy 
column of dust began to creep up 
into the sky where the creature 
had fallen. 

J ARVIS waited for something 
more to happen. But time went 
by and only the familiar warm si- 
lence of the woods reestablished 
itself. He fidgeted. He rubbed his 
eyes and wondered what it was he 
had really seen and what he should 
do about it. Perhaps he had drunk 
too much and scrambled awake 
with. the vestiges of a bad dream 
still clinging to his thoughts. 

But the sounds of the screaming 
birds still echoed in his memory, 
and he was not a man to imagine 
such elaborate monsters. 

I will go and discover what man- 
ner of creature it is that falls from 
the sky and makes such an awe- 
some noise . 



Having made his decision, he 
packed up his fishing rod and pro- 
ceeded to wade across the shallow 
section of the stream. He reached 
the other side, dried his feet on a 
deep patch of grass, pulled on his 
sandals and strode into the forest 
to locate the fallen object. 

His search took him some dis- 
tance into the trees— somewhat 
further than he had expected— 
where the thick trunks pressed 
close together and the ground was 
always shrouded in^deep shadow. 
The undergrowth was sparse at this 
time of the year and he found no 
difficulty in making progress— yet 
he moved cautiously, having no 
idea what to expect. 

It took him some time to locate 
the object, mainly because it 
became difficult for him to hold to 
his original line of sight now that 
he was deep into the forest. But the 
deep, jagged cleft that the thing 
had carved down through the trees 
was a beacon to his questing eyes: 
through this tortured passageway 
the sunlight found ready access 
and Jarvis quickened his pace 
when he was near enough for the 
light to seem a ragged pillar, 
beckoning. 

Approaching the point of im- 
pact he slowed down and came to a 
halt. His listened, but could hear 
no sound. He summoned his 
courage and moved forward, 
wondering what he might find. 

The creature had fallen on its 

159 



FALLEN SPACEMAN 




side and lay there staring at him 
like a crippled metal ogre. Its 
great legs were twisted underneath 
its massive trunk and its head was 
swung round at an incongruous 
angle. Instead of a face only a 
single polished disc stared back at 
him. 

Jarvis drew in his breath. The 
creature was at least three times 
bigger than a man and its body 
was covered with all manner of 
shiny protuberences, some of 
which had broken or been sheared 
off by its dreadful fall. 

He carefully made a wide cir- 
cuit around the creature before he 
became emboldened enough to 
move closer and examine the life- 
less humanoid in gr<eater detail. 
He might be an old man but he was 
no superstitious fool. He rec- 
ognized this creature as a 
machine, some sort of mechanical 
contrivance, the meaning of 
which was as yet lost to him. But he 
was determined to discover more. 

Why, here were massive arms of 
steel that could have crushed him 
like a cockroach. And these 
legs — what mighty engines drove 
them across the face of the earth? 

The creature still did not move. 
The fall had either killed it or 
knocked it senseless for a while. 

But from where had it fallen? 
And what was it doing here? 

Jarvis moved closer. He shook 
his head in amazement as he noted 
the immense girth of the creature 



and followed the line of one mighty 
shoulder until his eyes fastened 
upon the gigantic metal head. It 
was several times larger than a 
man’s and in the center was the 
bright circle that had first attracted 
his attention. 

The creature was lying on its 
side, its ‘‘face" pointing towards 
him. It took but a short step for 
him to be able to lean forward and 
peer down into that enigmatic pool 
of light. He looked past the grimy 
surface of the faceplate and at the 
pale white face on the other side. 
The creature's eyes were closed 
and its mouth was open; a faint 
dribble of blood welled from its 
mouth and trickled down its chin. 
Its skin had the same pale, trans- 
lucent quality as the belly of a fish. 

Jarvis recoiled in surprise and 
hastily crossed himself. 

He knew beyond doubt that he 
had looked down upon one of the 
space people. 

His legs began to shake. With- 
out wasting another moment he 
backed away from the fallen space- 
man and turned around and ran as 
fast as he could back to the village. 

M ATTARO regained con- 
sciousness and thought, / m 
alive! And felt the great waves of 
pain begin to eat away at his mind. 
He winced, closed his eyes and 
wondered how much of him had 
survived. He ached all over but 
none of his limbs felt broken: the 



160 



IF 




webbing had held. His left leg was 
bent at a painful angle but he 
could, with very little effort, with- 
draw it from the exoskeleton and 
give it some ease. The rest of his 
body felt numb and bruised. His 
head ached abominably. 

He tasted blood in his mouth and 
ran his tongue quickly around in- 
side. No broken teeth; just some 
torn sections of his cheek where he 
must have gripped them in agony 
during the final seconds of his 
fall. Nothing to worry about. 

He was alive! 

Happily, he began to explore the 
condition of his suit. He could get 
no sense out of the computer; it 
was sullen and silent. This caused 
him some concern. If the com- 
puter turned out to have been 
badly damaged he was as good as 
trapped. Only the computer could 
activate the suit and get it mov- 
ing — or open the access gate in the 
back of the suit. And if his power 
reserves were negative . 

Had he come so far to find him- 
self in a situation Just as hopeless 
as the one he had fled? 

He tried to calculate how much 
air he had left. But with no idea 
how long he had been uncon- 
scious this was an impossible task. 
And the computer couldn't help 
him. 

He knew some sort of settle- 
ment was nearby, otherwise the 
computer wouldn't have chosen to 
set him down here. But how could 



he be sure that anyone had 
witnessed his hasty descent — and 
what would they make of it if they 
had? 

His mind — already accustomed 
to dealing with an impossible 
situation and dulled by the im- 
pact of his fall — tried to devise 
some worthwhile plan of action. 
He waited until a full measure of 
feeling had returned to his limbs, 
then flexed them experimentally. 
He thought that he could detect a 
faint murmur of activity inside 
the computer casing and this made 
him hopeful. He tried again to set 
the suit moving; he moved his legs 
about inside the exoskeleton but 
only found resistance. The suit re- 
fused to be budged. 

After a while he gave up and 
considered the alternative. 

“Open the access hatch," he di- 
rected. 

No acknowledgment was forth- 
coming from the silent computer. 
The vital panel directly behind 
Mattaro didn't budge an inch. 
Sweating, he repeated the com- 
mand. 

“Open the access hatch." 

For just a fraction of a second 
something stirred inside the 
damaged brain of the computer. 
Perhaps some last measure of 
residual energy prodded the ma- 
chine into a simple gesture of 
assistance and, after this miserable 
erg of power had been dissipated, 
it slumped back into immobility. ' 



FALLEN SPACEMAN 



161 




Behind Mattaro the access hatch 
had begun to move. It had swung 
open a fraction — and stayed so. 
The bitter alien air creeping into 
his suit confirmed the fact. 

Mattaro swore. He repeated the 
command over and over again and, 
when this proved ineffective, with- 
drew his arms from the exo- 
skeleton and beat upon the weighty 
access hatch with what strength he 
could exert from his awkward 
reach. But it would not be moved 
any further. 

He could still hear a threshold 
whirr of activity inside the 
computer, but he wasn’t sure that 
the sound was genuine — it could 
have been a product of his own 
wishful thinking. 

He felt light-headed and 
slumped back into the webbing. 
Strange, but he couldn’t recall feel- 
ing like this before. Perhaps it was 
the fall— and the air. He could feel 
it stinging the inside of his nostrils 
and coursing down into his lungs. 

Of course — that would explain 
his peculiar light-headedness. It 
was the foul, unfiltered air of this 
damned planet that was making 
him feel so strange. But it was the 
only air he could depend on and it 
was better than none. 

He kept hoping that the com- 
puter might eventually reorganize 
itself and get him out of this mess, 
in the meantime he was alive and 
reasonably well off. The next mis- 
fortune he would have to face 



would be hunger — and to alleviate 
that he would have to find some 
way of getting out of his suit. 

"‘Open the access hatch,” he 
mumbled. ‘‘Open the access 
hatch — ” 

But the hatch remained 
stubbornly at its fixed position. 

Through the dust-shrouded face- 
plate he could make out the wide 
trunks of the trees and, in the dis- 
tance, some patched were the sun- 
light played on some branches in a 
clearing. The inside of the suit had 
cooled and that was something he 
could be thankful for. He could 
have come down in the tropics of 
the planet and might have had to 
endure a slow roasting before 
nightfall — or he could just as 
easily have been dumped into the 
sea if the power had given out 
earlier. There were plenty of 
alternatives, all right. But here he 
was and, in one way or another, he 
was still alive. 

In one v^ay or another . 

He kept talking to the com- 
puter, trying to cajole it back into 
some useful activity. He still 
wasn’t convinced that his cards 
had run out and he was determined 
to shake some life back into the 
stubborn little machine. 

It was some time before he 
noticed the dark faces peering 
down through his faceplate. 

A t first the townspeople 
thought that Jarvis had been 



162 



IF 




drinking too much, or had been 
taken by the sun; but when they 
saw that he was indeed sober and 
that it had been a vision and not the 
heat of the sun that had dazzled his 
mind, then some of his excitement 
began to carry over to them. 

Nobody had ever seen one of the 
space people— at least not for 
generations. The relatively short 
recorded history of their world 
was filled with the memory and 
mythology of the creatures who 
watched over them, but no one liv- 
ing had actually seen one of them 
at first hand, as Jarvis insisted he 
had. 

‘"It’s out there, in the forest just 
beyond the stream," he told them. 
"It fell down out of the sky and — " 

"And there was a man inside, 
you say?" somebody asked. 

"No. 1 say there was a space- 
man inside. He was all pale— kind 
of like a grub inside a shell." 

They hastily crossed themselves 
and, forming a citizen's com- 
mittee, herded Jarvis off to meet 
the town council. These seven men 
were older and wiser than anyone 
else in the village and it fell to them 
to make all the important de- 
cisions. 

Jarvis faced the mayor unflinch- 
ingly and repeated his story in de- 
tail. The council listened atten- 
tively, prepared to be skeptical. 

"Could you describe this ma- 
chine?", the mayor asked. He was 
old and arthritic and often queru- 

FALLEN SPACEMAN 



lous, but his fancy had been cap- 
tured by this loafer’s confession. 
"In detail, if you can." 

"Well, it was shaped like a man, 
only much bigger." Jarvis made an 
awkward diagram with his hands, 
a gesture that was meant to imply 
gigantic dimensions. "It had two 
arms and two legs and a monstrous 
head that—" 

The mayor swung around in his 
chair and conferred with his coun- 
cilmen. An air of portentous 
gravity descended upon the dark- 
paneled room; Jarvis waited 
nervously for a decision. From the 
expressions of grave concern he 
could detect on the faces of the 
council, it seemed that they were 
prepared to accept his story at 
face value. 

"Wait outside, please, Jarvis," 
the mayor requested. "We will join 
you in a moment and then you will 
take us to your discovery, so that 
we may all see this creature at 
close range." 

Jarvis bowed respectfully and 
went back outside to where a great 
number of townspeople had 
already assembled around the 
humble civic center. 

Mayor Dunstable led his coun- 
cilmen deep into the ancient cel- 
lars of the town hall. They paused 
outside a stout wooden door, 
crossed themselves three times, 
then held their positions while the 
mayor rose and unlatched the 
heavy wooden bar of the door 

163 




and slipped softly inside. Once he 
had disappeared and the door had 
been discreetly closed behind 
him, the councilmen sat cross-leg- 
ged and assumed a posture of silent 
meditation. 

It was dark inside the Shrine. 
The only light came from a soli- 
tary flame set in an ornate silver 
chalice upon the altar. The mayor 
kneeled just inside the threshold 
and offered up a few precious mo- 
ments of his lifetime in respectful 
meditation. The appropriate ritual 
completed, he rose and walked 
boldly towards the altar. 

A half a dozen steps closed the 
distance. The Shrine was small 
and had never been intended to 
accommodate more than one man, 
and he the supreme arbiter of the 
township. 

Dunstable ascended the three 
short steps leading up to the altar 
and reached out for the deep glass 
case that rested immediately in 
front of the chalice. Underneath 
the dusty lid the faded face of the 
Handbook was kept securely 
locked away from prying eyes. 
Dunstable ran his arthritic fingers 
along one side of the case until the 
personality-keyed lock snapped 
open the glass lid. He sighed, 
whispered some appropriate 
words of thanks and raised the lid. 
The Handbook was exposed and 
his hands shook as he reached for 
it. 

He handled the ancient volume 



with reverence. In all his long 
period of office he had only had 
occasion to consult the holy tome 
thrice before. The book held all his 
people's past and all their fu- 
ture — but its wisdom had to be 
used sparingly and only when all 
other knowledge failed or it would 
turn to poison. Its random and un- 
restricted use on other planets — in- 
cluding the place of human 
origins — had destroyed men’s 
minds and turned them against one 
another. 

B reathing heavily, Dun- 
stable consulted the index, turn- 
ing the heavy textured pages of the 
Handbook with loving care. It 
was so quiet in the Shrine that the 
sound of his own excited breathing 
seemed monstrously loud and out 
of all proportion. 

He studied the relevant pas- 
sages of the text for some time, 
reading slowly in order to impress 
each vital piece of information 
upon his no longer agile memory. 
Sometimes he nodded sagaciously 
to himself or smiled at some 
particularly enlightening snippet 
of information — on other oc- 
casions his eyes widened mo- 
mentarily in shock and surprise. 
The Handbook held many 
dazzling secrets that were not 
destined for the simple minds of 
this world. 

When he had satisfied his 
curiosity he reverently closed the 

IF 



164 




book and relocked the glass lid. 
He bowed and crossed himself 
three times to give himself time to 
erase irrelevancies from his mind, 
whispered a short word of prayer 
for the fallen spaceman and then 
went outside to rejoin his council- 
men. 

He summoned them from their 
meditations briskly: "‘Very well, 
gentlemen, now we may proceed.'' 

Jarvis led the way. He took them 
by way of the river road, the 
councilmen breathing heavily 
from the unaccustomed exertion. 
A small army of inquisitive towns- 
people followed at a respectful 
distance. News of Jarvis' dis- 
covery had traveled fast. 

The machine had not moved 
from where Jarvis had found it. It 
lay at the bottom of the ragged 
shaft in the trees and faced them 
with its lifeless eye. 

The mayor drew in his breath 
sharply. He murmured the ap- 
propriate words prescribed by the 
Handbook and crossed himself 
three times. His councilmen stood 
silent and watchful. Behind them, 
clustered in small groups among 
the trees, the hundred or more 
curious onlookers kept a cautious 
distance and did not need to be 
dissuaded from coming any closer. 
The spaceman made no response 
to the mayor's greeting. 

“You see,'' Jarvis said, “it 
doesn't move. Perhaps it can't 
move." 



The mayor nodded. “Very 
likely." He moved closer and 
walked a careful circuit around 
the massive creature, drawing 
upon his recent reserves of mem- 
ory of the Handbook to help him 
identify the exact nature of the fal- 
len object. 

“It « a spaceman, isn’t it?" Jar- 
vis asked. 

Dunstable waited until he had 
completed his study of the object 
before he commented. He looked 
up through the great, broken shaft 
in the forest towards the sunlit 
sky. 

“It is, Jarvis," he agreed 

There was no point in denying 
what was self-evident. He had 
stepped close and looked through 
the dusty faceplate and had seen 
the pale white face that Jarvis had 
spoken of. The eyes had been 
momentarily closed, but the 
identity of the creature had been 
unmistakable. 

By now the other councilmen 
had crowded close. “My friends," 
Dunstable informed them, “Jarvis 
had indeed discovered one of the 
space people. How he came here 
we do not know. He has fallen 
from the sky and it has been our 
privilege to find him. ^Let us 
pray— “ 

With one accord all bowed their 
heads while the mayor intoned 
words from the Handbook whose 
meaning he himself did not fully 
understand, though they should 

165 



FALLEN SPACEMAN 




have evoked a response from the 
object on the ground. 

But the spaceman did not move 
and Dunstable began to wonder if 
the visitor from the skies were alive 
or if the terrible fall had killed him. 

His prayer completed, the mayor 
lifted his head with a slight sug- 
gestion of impatience. Around 
him the woods were alive with 
peering, frightened faces. He 
motioned them to come closer so 
that they might hear what he had to 
say, 

""My good friends, this is indeed 
a wondrous day for us. This — this 
machine you see here is what is 
known as a ‘space suit.' It is meant 
to protect the space people from all 
sorts of dangers — remember, their 
empire is vast and beyond our 
comprehension; it accommodates 
many thousands of worlds like ours 
and many more where environ- 
ments are hostile and dangerous. 
They must protect themselves 
from inhospitable climates and 
even airlessness — and they have 
evolved these miraculous uniforms 
in order to move without diffi- 
culty from world to world." 

While he spoke he moved closer 
to the fallen spaceman and 
indicated certain aspects of the 
massive space armor. “As you see, 
this suit is many times larger than 
the man inside, yet these great 
metal limbs respond effortlessly to 
his movements and endow him 
with the ability to perform 



prodigious feats that would other- 
wise be beyond his capabilities. In 
a sense the machine is alive and 
ordinarily should respond to — " 

“But how did he get here?" 
someone interrupted. It was a cry 
from among the many faces 
pressing closer through the trees. 

Dunstable hesitated. “We can't 
be sure. Perhaps he was working 
somewhere in the sky." He 
gestured overhead. 

“And he fell from thereV' 
Another incredulous voice. 

Dunstable frowned. Just how 
much information might he 
safely — and with good intentions 
— divulge? The Handbook left 
much to his judgment. He knew 
from it that mighty ships moved 
between distant worlds and that 
some day — in an unimaginaible 
distant future — the descendants 
of his people would evolve suffi- 
ciently in knowledge to lay claim 
to a similar heritage. It seemed 
quite likely that one of these won- 
drous sky chariots might have 
been passing nearby when the 
spaceman fell. Dunstable had used 
the prescribed words to arouse the 
visitor, but perhaps there was a 
limit to what he could tell his peo- 
ple. The words, of course, hadn't 
worked. 

“He fell — and that is all we 
know," he replied. 

“But is he alive?" another asked. 

The mayor raised both hands in 
a gesture for silence. “That we 

IF 



166 




must now ascertain/' He nodded 
towards Jarvis. ‘‘Perhaps you 
found him for a reason. He may 
respond to you. Take a closer look, 
will you?" 

Jarvis grinned. He basked in his 
new importance. He strode con- 
fidently to the machine and leaned 
over so that he was peering closely 
into the faceplate. A few of the 
councilmen followed to looked 
cautiously over his shoulder. 

It was some time before Jarvis 
realized that the creature's eyes 
were open and that he was staring 
out at them — and not quite seeing 
them. Something unseen seemed 
to have passed between them. 

Jarvis jerked back in surprise. 
The councilmen quickly got out of 
the way. They looked discon- 
certed. 

‘‘He is awake," Jarvis reported. 
“But he does not seem to see us." 

The mayor stepped forward and 
corroborated Jarvis' observation. 
And as he looked down and deeply 
into the pale, blank eyes of the 
spaceman he felt an unpleasant 
chill shake his body. He remained 
hunched forward and staring for 
some time, then stood aside and 
motioned his fellow Councilmen 
to step forward so that they might 
each, in turn, look with reverence 
upon the unfortunate creature. If 
the spaceman was conscious of 
this solemn parade of faces in front 
of him then he made no move to 
acknowledge what he saw. 

FALLEN SPACEMAN 



We must work quickly, Dun- 
stable realized, or it may be too 
late to help him ... 

He summoned one of the near- 
by villagers — an adventurous lad of 
early years — and sent him back to 
the village for the town physician 
and blacksmith. The blacksmith 
was to bring his strongest and most 
reliable tools and the physician to 
arrange for a pallet to be brought, 
so that the spaceman might be 
gently transported to a place of 
seclusion and rest — if he could be 
rescued from the gigantic space- 
suit that could soon become a cof- 
fin. 

While he waited anxiously he 
supervised the curious villagers 
into a long, slow-moving column 
that filed cautiously past the 
gigantic metal head and looked 
furtively in through the dusty face- 
plate at the pale, unsmiling face of 
the spaceman. 

M ATTARO was conscious — in 
a vague sort of half-life — of 
the strange faces peering down at 
him. They were like dreadful fig- 
ures in a dream; the faces all 
screwed up with time, skins 
scorched a dark, unpleasant color 
by the naked radiation of their sun 
—he could not find it in him to ac- 
cept them as human beings. 
Mother, my mind is on fire . 
His body was covered by a dense 
film of sweat. Drops of it had 
formed above his eyes and splashed 

167 




down, making it difficult for him 
to see. His breathing was shallow 
and irregular; his mouth was dry 
and his limbs burned with some 
strange internal fusion he could not 
understand. 

Mother, am / dying? 

His time was running out — had 
run out. He was breathing alien 
air — deadly, unfiltered — and it 
was having a terrifying effect 
upon his sterile metabolism. A 
hundred unseen bacteria had 
already invaded his bloodstream 
and each minute added more. In no 
time at all he would be reduced to a 
sick and festering hospital 
case — unless they, those people 
outside whom he loathed, some- 
how got him out of here anchplaced 
him in some sort of rigid 
quarantine and purged his weaken- 
ed body of the microscopic in- 
vaders. But what standard of 
medicine could he expect from such 
people? 

Probably little better than primi- 
tive herbalism, he thought, and 
wondered why his burning mind 
did not react more fearfully to this 
supposition. Perhaps he was 
rapidly losing the capacity to care. 

Time passed and the strange 
faces no longer paraded past his 
faceplate. Only occasionally did 
one Or two — with which he had be- 
come familiar — press forward, 
perhaps to monitor his rapid 
deterioration. Why dont they do 
something? 



Instead of just watching him and 
haunting him with their archaic in- 
competence. 

Help me, his mind cried out. 
Cant you see I need help? I'm 
dying, don't you see that? Can't 
you see that? 

And for himself alone: Mother, 
am I really? 

Had he survived his desertion 
and his incredible descent only to 
have what was left of him burned 
alive by these terrible alien 
bacteria? Was there no way for him 
to . 

He could feel his mind slipping 
away, his conscious thoughts dis- 
integrating; the possibility of logi- 
cal, sequential thought became 
lost to him. His hands ceased their 
occasional fumbling with the dead 
controls and he slumped back in- 
to the fiery well that was his world. 
He closed his eyes and fell into a 
deep sleep, surrounded by the fires 
and fury of a hell that had only pre- 
viously existed in the unplumbed 
depths of his racial memory. 

B LEEKER, the blacksmith, eyed 
the space suit doubtfully. 
haven’t any tools that can open 
that thing,” he announced. ”Just 
take a close look at the metal. I’ve 
never seen anything like it.” 

”What about the faceplate?” the 
mayor asked. He had become 
agitated; their time was running 
out. “Could we — ” 

“Not unless you want to mash

him about and kill him. The stuffs 
too tough to cut — or for a couple of 
taps to crack it open.'' 

'There's some sort of opening 
around the back," Jarvis said. 
"I've been looking real close and it 
seems to me that there's some sort 
of hatchway there. It’s opened 
slightly." 

The blacksmith walked around 
to the other side of the suit and 
hunkered down in the dirt so that 
he could inspect the narrow open- 
ing the old man indicated. It was a 
narrow crack about three and a 
half feet long and it did indeed look 
like part of a hatchway. But the 
rest of it merged so smoothly with 
the gigantic carapace that it was 
difficult to gauge its shape. 

"Well, what do you say?" 
Dunstable asked. "Can you lever 
that open?" 

The blacksmith pursed his heavy 
lips and scowled. "Wouldn't like to 
say. But I'll give it a go." He stood 
up, spat on his hands and rubbed 
them together. "Get as many 
strong lads as you can find — we'll 
be needing them. If we take it in 
shifts then we just might budge it. 
But it’ll take strength if I'm to 
judge from the workmanship of 
this thing." 

The mayor leaned closer and, 
out of sight of the rest of the towns- 
people, breathed a confidence: 
"We have to get him out, you 
understand. Our air is dangerous 
to his lungs; it could very well kill 

FALLEN SPACEMAN 



him. And if we don't get him to the 
physician in time — " 

The blacksmith nodded. "Well, 
no use standing here. Let's get, on 
with it . 

He walked back to where he had 
deposited an assortment of his 
tools on the bare ground. He 
selected a long crowbar and 
gestured to one of the young men 
who had assigned themselves to 
his direction. "I have several more 
of these in my barn. Go fetch 
them — as fast as you can. We’ll 
have need of them." 

The youth— and one other- 
hastened away. 

Bleeker gripped the crowbar in 
his hands and moved back behind 
the gigantic space suit. He found 
the narrow aperture of the hatch- 
way and worked the sharp point of 
the instrument an inch or so into 
the crevice. He leaned with all his 
weight upon the other end but the 
hatchway — if that was what it 
was — refused to budge. 

"Some help here, lads," he 
called out. 

And they rushed forward to par- 
take of this unaccustomed ritual. 



M ATTARO felt and heard the 
blows and curses and the 
hammering at his back, but he did 
not mind. Half in and half out of 
this grotesque world, with his mind 
on fire and his body weeping a 
rank, offensive fluid from every 

169 




pore, he found time to dream in his 
fiery hell. 

Through the flames he could see 
the great ships he had traveled with 
and the marvelous worlds his peo- 
ple had made for themselves be- 
tween the stars, like delicate 
crystaline webs spun across the 
eternal night. His skin tingled with 
affectionate memory of the 
warmth beamed down by the tiny 
suns they had kindled to illumi- 
nate his world. 

Mother, why hast thou forsaken 
me? 

Accidentally. She did not know. 

You should have known. Moth- 
er. Dont you see? My mind is on 
fire, fm burning up, one small cell 
at a time... 

He saw his home world moving 
through space, felt the benign 
gravitation beneath his feet and 
basked in the emancipation of his 
people. He was space-born and 
had never known the feel of a 
planet underneath his feet or the 
burden of an unvarying gravity. 
His environment had been 
efficaciously controlled and he 
had never been exposed to the 
remorseless ravages of time and of 
the seasons that had made the 
faces of the colonists so gaunt and 
their lifetimes so short. And now 
he had fallen from this state of 
grace. 

In his burning mind he saw his 
world turn and move toward him. 
Attendant suns flickered and died; 



the dark heavens disappeared and 
his world shimmered and opaqued 
as it moved from one realm of 
space into another so that it might 
cross light-years in an instant. 
Mother, are you coming for me? 
Mother? 

It was getting darker outside. 
Had the sky become dull as it pre- 
pared this world for dusk or had his 
eyesight betrayed him? 

Mattaro was afraid. 

I T TOOK them nearly two hours 
to open the stubborn hatchway. 
Two hours of sweating and cursing 
and sheer exhaustion. The black- 
smith remained doggedly in com- 
mand, seeing his youthful helpers 
come and go, applying their 
determined strength to the crow- 
bars and then despairing— and 
each time moving the doorway a 
few millimeters more. 

Finally it was wide enough for 
them to perceive the man inside 
and for them to reach in and grasp 
his shoulders. The spaceman did 
not stir: his mind — and his 
strength — seemed to have failed 
him. 

They eased him from the pro- 
tective webbing as gently as they 
could and carefully lowered him to 
a pallet. 

The villagers stood back in awe. 
He seemed so pale and fragile with- 
out his fantastic carapace, like a 
chrysalis ripped before its time 
from its cocoon; but even then his 



170 



IF 




body seemed to radiate a supernal 
quality that was quite overpower- 
ing. 

Some fell to their knees and 
prayed. Women wept and small 
children hugged their mothers' 
skirts and looked out upon the 
creature with one eye closed. A 
mornful chant went up from a 
group composed of older women; 
the dirge was caught up by the rest 
of the villagers and intoned with a 
deep sense of forboding. 

The town physician bent over the 
wasted spaceman. He rolled back 
each eyelid in turn with his thumb 
and clucked disapprovingly. He 
rose, crossed himself and directed 
the two men he had assigned as 
carriers to hasten about their 
business. 

'Take him to my surgery," he 
directed. '‘Quickly." 

The two men trotted off. A path 
opened for them between the awe- 
struck villagers. The mayor and his 
councilmen hurried after the litter 
as best as they could. The physi- 
cian, a few years their junior, set a 
cracking pace they found difficult 
to emulate. Jarvis hurried after 
them, a look of deep concern on 
his wizened face. 

After a short pause, during 
which the doleful chant fragmented 
and died, the villagers moved after 
the outre procession, like tufts of 
weed sucked into a vacuum left by 
a passing wind. 

The blacksmith Carefully packed 



up his tools, then made his way 
slowly back to the township. 

M ATTARO was conscious of 
the journey by litter only as 
an even, jogging rhythm, occasion- 
ally broken. His mind had ceased 
to function in the external world. 
His body was on fire from head to 
toe and he was not responsible for 
the parade of images that danced 
through the brightlands of his 
fiery thoughts. 

They placed him in the physi- 
cian's surgery, in a warm bed that 
had been quickly installed for the 
occasion. They closed and barred 
all the windows and lit a great fire 
in the hearth, hoping that these 
humble precautions would keep 
out the deadly bacteria and help to 
warm the spaceman's cold body. 
But he was aware of none of these 
thoughtful ministrations. 

The physician readied a seda- 
tive and poured a little of it into 
the spaceman's mouth. The poor 
creature seemed to have lost the 
ability to move his lips and his 
tongue, so the remainder of the 
dense liquid spilled down onto the 
bedclothes. But enough found its 
way down his tortured throat to 
prove effective. 

He quickly fell asleep. His 
breathing became more regular 
and his degree of perspiration 
slackened. A nightwatch was kept 
by his bedside and they hoped that 
his strange fever would abate. But 



FALLEN SPACEMAN

when morning came they found 
him delirious and they were un- 
able to reach him. 

OTRANGE dreams haunted 
^Mattaro’s dying. He saw times 
and places and creatures he could 
never have imagined, let alone have 
remembered. But a part of him 
that had not yet been touched by 
the deadly fire did remember. 

Sometimes he seemed to stand 
naked on a rock-strewn landscape 
while a savage wind drove a 
scouring rain against his bare, 
shivering flesh. Another time he 
huddled in a cave, his body 
wrapped in foul-smelling skins, 
and watched the flickering fire- 
light in front of him weave eerie 
patterns on the walls — walls upon 
which were carved unimaginable 
things. And outside the hungry 
howls of carniverous animals 
savaged the night. 

He saw suns from an angle he 
had never before known: high over- 
head in a sky of dazzling blue and 
ochre. He felt his feet sink into the 
rich, dark soil of a hundred 
different worlds. His dying mind 
became a riot of landscapes he 
had never seen, people he had 
never known and worlds he would 
never have thought possible. And 
still he did not understand. 

He was pithecanthropus, homo 
sapiens, Jupiter and Zeus; Alexan- 
der and Plato, Aristophanes and 
Icarus; he was Christ and Mo- 



hammed, Freud and Jung, Colum- 
bus and Armstrong; Montgomery, 
Napoleon — and Hitler. He was ev- 
erything and everybody who had 
ever lived. 

There: in the bottommost rag- 
bag of all, the racial memory that 
had slumbered untapped until the 
Pandora’s box of this world had 
opened and swallowed him up. 

Now he remembered. In odd, 
distorted fragments, all that his 
people had ever been and ever 
hoped to be. It was all there, had 
always been there, but con- 
sciously inviolate until now. Un- 
til this dreadful dying had been 
visited upon him. 

His own world seemed very far 
away, almost a superimposed 
memory — and nothing more. The 
fires had eaten most of it away; 
only a few tattered remnants clung 
to his disintegrated thoughts. 

His would-be rescuers watched 
over him, bathed his body and did 
what they could to ease his pain. 
But there was a limit to what their 
primitive medicine could accom- 
plish and even the reluctant phy- 
sician finally had to admit that 
his survival was in the hands of 
the gods. 

By which he meant the space 
people. 

In the morning the sun rose and 
shone brightly through the open 
window at the foot of his bed. They 
saw no reason to maintain the 
useless facade of protection any 



172 



IF 




longer and they thoijight he would 
appreciate the sunlight. 

Something seemed to happen. 
He opened his eyes and looked out 
upon the wonder of this fresh 
young world and for the first time 
since they had rescued him a small 
measure of insanity and recogni- 
tion crept into his eyes. 

But his brain still burned and the 
pain was terminal. Something 
beautiful seemed to come across 
the sweeping grasslands and over 
the river and down toward the 
house where he had slumbered. 

Something gigantic and hopeful, 
a great gull-winged world, dazzling 
in the light of its twin attendant 
suns. It grew until it filled his mind 
and blotted out the terrifying 
ancient landscapes. 

For a moment he strugged and 
sat up, leaning heavily on one weak 
elbow. His other hand stretched 
out toward the open window and 
a wild, glazed look leaped into his 
eyes. 

“Mother!” he cried. 

But the shimmering, golden 
world turned suddenly away. The 
tiny suns winked out and the daz- 
zling silhouette of his home pre- 
sented her stern to him, like a 
ghostly galleon passing by a 
drifting, abandoned seaman. For 
perhaps several seconds he re- 
mained rigid in that posture, his 
eyes fastened upon some deep in- 
ternal vision, and then he slumped 
back. 



“Mother — ” he whispered. 

He closed his eyes and saw no 
more and several hours later he 
was dead. 



T he funeral was held the fol- 
lowing day. The whole town 
turned out for the occasion, each 
person bearing mind what he and 
she would relate to their children 
and their children’s children — how 
the town had witnessed the fall of a 
spaceman and attended his magni- 
ficent funeral. 

They made his grave a short dis- 
tance from the town, atop a small 
rise where the first rays of the 
morning sun would warm his cold 
ghost, and they declared it to be a 
holy place where pilgrims might 
draw spiritual sustenence. Every 
day thereafter two small children 
visited the grave and placed small 
floral tributes to the departed 
spaceman, and two small trees 
were planted so that they might be 
nourished by the holy soil; and the 
fruit they eventually bore was 
known as holy thereafter and was 
partaken of on the one day of the 
year when the town com- 
memorated the fall of the space- 
man. 

And so the spaceman vanished 
into legend. The two small trees 
took strong root and flourished 
over his grave and their fine silver 
branches grew and yearned to- 
wards the distant sky. •

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

As a geneticist, I have followed 
with interest your editorials in Gal- 
axy and If on ""skintelligence"' and 
heartily support your position. / 
find it difficult to reconcile the at- 
titudes you express in your editor- 
ials with the use of phrases such as 
""that's white of you" and ""indian 
giver" which appear in Laumers' 
story in the last issue of\f. 

I feel that as editor you bear re- 
sponsibility for seeing to it that 
careless use of phrases derogatory 
to certain groups of people does 
not occur within your magazines. I 
recognize the possibility that it 
might be ""in character" for cer- 
tain story people to speak this way, 
but I think that the literary use of 
such expressions must be ex- 
ceedingly carefully scrutinized. In 
the story in question I do not feel 
that there was any justification for 
such chauvinistic terms. * 

With reference to Coney's story in 
the same issue, / should like to call 
to your attention that geneticists 
have dropped the terms ""mongol" 
and ""mongoloid" nearly a decade 
ago as objectionable in their racial 
implications. Downs Syndrome** 



is the presently accepted terminol- 
ogy, named after the man who 
first described the condition. 

One of the few advantages of my 
participation in the present wave of 
professional unemployment is that 
I have time to write letters. Who 
knows, / might even start writing 
science fiction . 

Selina Bendix, Ph.D. 

Berkeley, Cal. 

I give myself full freedom to say 
what I feel compelled to say in the 
space I allot myself in these mag- 
azines and sign with the label of my 
true descent and natural heritage. 
And of course there’s always the 
hope that minds will meet. 

But I don’t give myself the same 
liberties under other people’s by- 
lines in the rest of the magazine or 
magazines, whose primary func- 
tions 1 see as serving a highly ar- 
ticulate and intelligent, specialized 
readership. Theoretically — though 
the theory has yet to be tested — I 
should be able to publish a piece of 
fiction diametrically opposed to 
my views, provided it were true to 
its art and genre. And were not a 
lie. 

But I agree with your goals. Dr. 
Bendix, and am delighted on these 
pages to pass your comments on to 
readers and authors. Though 1 feel 
that you may have misread 
Laumer, whose use of the cliches of 
Earth colonialism in the Retief 
series is a consistent, satiric and 



174 



IF 



quiet swearing at that colonialism. 
And let’s get “Down’s Syndrome” 
accepted by the dictionary pub- 
lishers. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I think there can be a ''working 
definition'' of science fiction, and it 
could be: A story using some or all 
of (1) science, (2) imaginative 
theoretical science, {3} fanciful po- 
etic license, treating of some as- 
pect of life in the real and for imag- 
inary universe, past, present, and/ 
or future: the proportion of these 
determining whether the story is 
realistic, speculative or fanciful. 

This can be reduced to a logical set 
of symbols that are too funda- 
mental to be further reduced: +5 

S 

-s 

Even when there is very little or no 
science in science fiction we in- 
stinctively use science {or our 
knowledge of it) as measure, and 
some fantasy seems to suggest 
another science that springs from a 
hidden aspect of reality: so, even 
with the supernatural, can one get 
away from the science (or lack of 
it) in science fiction and fantasy? 

Henry Bitman 
Azusa, Cal. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

First of all I want to thank you for 
the reply I received from you. I see 
what a writer meant when he men- 
tioned that personal touch a cou- 
ple months ago. 



/ just finished reading Fear No Evil 
and Whipping Star the other day. I 
know that the one is over a year 
old, but to tell the truth this is the 
first time I've had a chance to sit 
down and read the whole thing. 
I've got some issues back in I960 
I'm still promising myself I'll read 
when I get a chance. 

Tm happy to see that Galaxy is 
back on a monthly schedule — the 
only thing is that with the very poor 
distribution in this city, that means 
I have to be on the lookout twice as 
often. Can you tell me why If gets 
better distribution? 

But back to the two novels: I think 
I was sidetracked. I dont know 
why, but in recent months Tve had 
the feeling that every author has 
been rushed to conclude his work, 
not only in your magazines but 
others, too. Maybe Tm being too 
critical with this, but Heinleins 
ending had the feeling of being 
tacked on and Herbert's had a feel- 
ing of deus ex machina. What the 
novel Dune Messiah had I wont 
even say — except to tell you I was 
quite disappointed. 

However, weak Heinlein, Herbert, 
or even T. J. Bass’s little tidbits are 
better than a lot of the utter crud 
being marketed in paperback for- 
mat these days. At least these au- 
thors know how to write. 

Maybe the only way out is for me 
to attempt to submit something to 
you, at least then Td have the right 
to complain. There's only one 
problem, I don't know if the world

is yet ready for me — or I for it. 

John Beck 
Youngstown, Ohio 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Thank you very much for printing 
my letter that requested help in 
forming a science fiction group in 
Calgary. 

A member of the British Columbia 
SF Society saw the letter, looked 
my name up in the phone direc- 
tory, and gave me a call. He gave 
me addresses of peoply who would 
offer suggestions on how to form a 
group. All in all I contacted over 20 
but the important thing was the 
appearance of the letter in If. 
Your assistance was vital in get- 
ting things started in Calgary. 
Enclosed you will find a^brief de- 
scription of our first meetings and 
how the group developed. I hope to 
print a guide to forming SF groups 
and will send you copies. The guide 
should come in handy if any other 
I f readers want to organize. 

The next few comments are on If. 
I hope you will take them in the 
spirit in which they were made, 
that of constructive criticism. 

When you print a letter, why not 
print the full address of the writer? 
I would like to contact Sid Krup- 
icka about the PROMETHEUS 
PROJECT but all I know from the 
Jan-Feb 1971 issue is that he lives 
in Riverside, California. Do I write 
and hope the post office is willing 
to hunt through all the Krupicka's 
to find Sid? Or will the letter come 



back marked Insufficient Ad- 
dress? Suppose If gave its ad- 
dress as only New York, N. Y. 
10017; would this letter have 
reached you? 

Second point. There is something 
about the type face being used that 
makes it difficult to read. I have no 
trouble reading pocketbooks with 
smaller type but there is some 
quirk in IF printing that irritates 
me. I can't pin it down but that's 
what I feel. 

Third. I think the illos in If leave 
something to be desired, including 
the covers. Freas-Finlay- Valigur- 
sky seem to draw beautiful and 
striking illusions with depth and re- 
ality. In comparison the Jan-Feb 
cover seems flat and stale. That's 
just one opinion of course and I 
admit a very biased statistical 
sampling. 

There are, believe it or not, a few 
good words I can write about If. 
Reading Room by del Rey is al- 
ways excellent and I really enjoyed 
that Retief story. The magazine 
content is great! Well, so much at 
playing critic. 

My best regards in '71,

The doctor ffoM ine/"Marguerileryou can be alive and ugly/ 
or beautKwl and dead? 



The day I first noticed the small pink spot on my 
cheek, I had other things on my mind. The New York 
papers said, “Marguerite Piazza opens at the Persian 
Room". I covered the spot with makeup, walked out 
into the spotlight, and forgot it— forgot everything— 
in the joy of singing. 

It wasn't until the spot began to spread, that I went 
to a cancer specialist. The day the doctor told me I'd 
have to have radical face surgery, I was sure my career 
was over. It was no longer a matter of saving my looks. 
Just of saving my life. 

They kept the mirrors in my hospital room covered 
for a week. And yet today, thanks to the fantastic skill 



of the surgeons, I sing in the spotlight again. I let myself 
be photographed full-face by a famous photographer 
of glamorous women. And I am alive. 

So now you know why I am appealing to you on 
behalf of the American Cancer Society. To give money. 
To get regular checkups. And to pay attention to can- 
cer's warning signals. 

You know, there's something much worse than find- 
ing out you have cancer. And that's not finding out.
