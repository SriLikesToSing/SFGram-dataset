WIPED OUT 



T he other day we went to the 
Boskone — which, in Bcience- 
fictionese, means both Doc Smith's 
legendary enemy of the Lensmen 
and the BOSton Science-Fiction 
CONference. Pleasant the proceed- 
ings were, including a talk on arti- 
ficial intellilgence by MIT's Marvin 
Minsky (for our money, the com- 
puter theorist of the decade), pres- 
entation of the E. E. Smith Memor- 
ial Award for 1967 to Isaac Asimov 
(who didn't expect it and was a 
study in consternation; last year, 
when it went to the undersigned, 
we hadn't been tipped off ahead of 
time either, and we can't help think- 
ing that one of these years the Bos- 
ton fans will have their nicely en- 
graved trophy all ready — and no 
one there to give it to, because the 
fellow it was meant for caught an 
early plane home!), a most useful 
and constructive talk by Guest of 
Honor Damon Knight (of which 
you'll hear more in a later issue) 
and so on. 

Including a hands-across-the-sea 
debate on that frothy development 
in science-fiction critical circles, the 
New Wave of British Science Fic- 
tion. 

T > start with, what is this new 
British wave? 



To explain it to us, half a dozen 
science-fiction writers had gathered 
in London a few weeks earlier with 
a tape recorder going. They were 
a worthy crew: Americans Judith 
Merrii and Tom Disch, Britons 
Brian W. Aldiss, Miohaei Moorcock 
(editor of the English sf magazine. 
New Worlds, which is so well 
thought of locally that it has re- 
ceived a government grant to keep 
it going — a precedent which has 
made some of us U S. editors quietly 
thoughtful of late), and others as 
yet less well known in this country. 
( Although we're hoping to bring you 
some of them in future issues of our 
new companion magazine, Interna- 
tional Science Fiction,) These are 
well qualified people, all of them; 
but what they said left some of us 
on the receiving end puzzled — and 
others hopping mad. 

Representing the American point 
of view were half a dozen voices, 
including Lester del Key, Isaac Asi- 
mov and your editor. We listened to 
the tape; then we talked back, with 
the machine now recording, so we 
could send our rebuttal back to 
England. 

T he New Wave of British Science 
Fiction, we were told by the 



4 





Wollensak, lies not so much in any 
particular story or author as in a 
climate of freedom of expression and 
liberty to experiment unmatched 
anywhere else in the world. ^‘We’re 
bored with trips to bloody Saturn/^ 
said the voices from overseas. ‘‘We 
want the right to experiment, to be 
free, to try new forms of writing, 
like Burroughs.” (No, not that Bur- 
roughs! They mean William Bur- 
roughs, author of The Naked Lunch, 
instead of Tarzan’s Edgar Rice.) 

Want to experiment? Great Klo- 
no’s brazen claws, yes! No kind of 
writing can survive without con- 
stantly reaching out for new fron- 
tiers — of every kind: in theme, in 
treatment, in point of view. And 
experimentation in science fiction 
has produced some lovely results: 
Jack Vance and his Dragon Masters, 
nearly everything written by the 
late Cordwainer Smith, Brian Al- 
diss’s own The Long Afternoon of 
Earth. But — notice something? 
None of these is really new. And 
only one of them is En>^ish. 

However, this is not to say that 
there is nothing going on over there. 
Something is; and it is in fact pro- 
ducing new writers who are surely 
promising. Will they last? Even, 
will the promise mature into per- 
formance? It is too early to say for 
sure; but we hope so. Sometime soon 
we’ll be bringing you some work by 
some of these new writers — for 
instance, a rather hauntingly special 
complete short novel. Sunbeam Car- 
ess, by David Redd, which we ouigiht 
to be able to get into print, let’s see, 
two or three issues from now. 
They’re worthwhile. But — 

There’s always a but. The “but” 
in this case is, hut they are not the 
only kind of science fiction that’s 
worthwhile. Bloody Saturn can still 
be fun — and fun is one of the 
things that science ^fiction has to 



offer. Larry Niven or Poul Ander- 
son can still thrill us with the sort 
of science-fiction color that bright- 
ens a day — because we know 
they’re to be trusted with the back- 
grounds they write about, and aren’t 
inventing impossible worlds for the 
sake of a cheap effect. Hard and 
witty satire is still worth looking 
at; so is a Heinlein or Clarke de- 
tailed and lively examination of how 
people will live tomorrow. 

There are, in short, a hundred 
ways in which a science-fiction story 
can be good. What is wrong with 
so much of the “New Wave” is not 
that it is experimental in form, but 
that it is so damned dull in every 
other way. 

By all means experiment, fellows. 
But the whole idea of makiinjg an 
experiment is that you can’t tell 
ahead of time whether or not it will 
succeed. And why do you insist on 
publishing your failures? 

I t isn’t really the writers who are 
to blame. It’s probably more the 
fault of the critics, who have a 
terrible problem. Derivative, second- 
order, parasitic, they can be en- 
tertaining only when they have 
something entertaining to review, 
only fresh when they espy some- 
thing fresh in what they are dis- 
cussing. This is why every literature 
and artistic put-on of the last few 
decades has received its deadpan 
adulation from critics who don’t 
know, or can’t afford to know, that 
they are being taken in. 

Would you like to know the defi- 
nition of a good science-fiction 
story? It is a story that, after read- 
ing, you are Iglad you read. 

That’s all there is to all of criti- 
cism. But of course no one could 
build a critical career on saying 
that in print.

The Felled Star 

/ 

PHILIP JOSE FARMER 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 




Every human from oil of Time 
lived again on Riverworld — 
and died again, over and over! 



I poopdeck of the Dreyrugr (Blood- 

stained). Ari Grimolfsson, the 
ii'O esurrection, like politics, helmsman, not understanding Eng- 
JV makes strange bedfellows,” lish, looked bleakly at Clemens. 
Sam Clemens said. “I can’t say Clemens translated for him in 
that the sleeping is very restful.” wretched Old Norse. The helmsman 
Telescope under one arm, he still looked bleak. 
puffed on a long, green cigar while Clemens swore loudly in English 
he paced back and forth on the and cursed him for a dunderheaded 



6 




barbarian. For three years, Clemens 
had been practicing tentih-cenitury 
Norse night and day. And he was 
still only half-intelligible to most 
of the men and women aboard the 
Dreyrugr. 

“A ninety-five-year-old Huck Finn, 
give or take a few thousand 
years,” Clemens said, “I start out 
down the river on a raft. Now I’m 
on this idiot Viking ship, going up- 
river. What next? W^en will I real- 
ize my dream?” 

Keeping the upper part of his 
right arm close to his body so he 
would not drop the precious tele- 
scope, he pounded his right fist into 
his open left palm. 

**Iron! I need iron! But where on 
this people-rich, metal-poor planet 
is iron? There has to be some. Other- 
wise, where did Erik’s axe come 
from? And how much is there? 
Enough? Probably not. Probably 
there’s just a very small meteorite. 
But maybe there’s enough for what 
I want. But where? My God, the 
river may be twenty million miles 
long! The iron, if any, may be at 
the other end. 

“No, that can’t be! It has to be 
somewhere not too far away, within 
100,000 miles of here. But we may 
be going in the wrong direction. 

Ignorance, the mother of hysteria 
»> 

He looked through the telescope 
at the right bank and cursed again. 
Despite his pleas to bring the ship 
in closer so that he could scan the 
faces at a closer range, he had been 
refused. The king of the Norseman 
fleet, Eric Bloodaxe, said that this 
was hostile territory. Until the fleet 



was out of it, the fleet would stay 
close to the middle of the river. 

The Dreyrugr was the flagship of 
three, all alike. It was eighty feet 
long, built largely of bamboo and 
resembled a Viking dragonboat. It 
had a long low hull, an oaken fig- 
urehead carved into a dragon’s head, 
and a curled-tail stern. But it also 
had a raised foredeck and poopdeck, 
the sides of both extending out over 
the water. The two bamboo masts 
were fore-and-aft rigged, the sails 
a very thin but tough and flexible 
membrane, made from the stomach 
of the deep-dwelling “riverdragon” 
fish. There was also a rudder con- 
trolled by a wheel on the poopdeck. 

The round leather-and-oak shields 
of the crew hung over the sides; the 
great oars were piled on racks. The 
Dreyrugr was sailing against the 
wind, tacking back and forth, a 
maneuver unknown to the Norse- 
men when they had lived on Earth. 

The men and women of the crew 
not handling the ropes sat on the 
oarsmen benches and talked and 
threw dice and played poker. From 
below the poopdeck came cries of 
exultation or curses and an occa- 
sional faint click. Bloodaxe and his 
bodyguard were shooting pool, and 
their doing so at this time made 
Clemens very nervous. Bloodaxe 
knew that enemy ships three miles 
up the river were putting out to 
intercept them, and ships from both 
banks behind them were putting out 
to trail them. Yet the king was pre- 
tending to be very cool. Maybe he 
was actually undisturbed, as Drake 
had supposedly been just before the 
battle of the Great Armada. 



THE FELLED STAR

“But the conditions are different 
here,” Clemens muttered. “Hiere’s 
not much room to maneuver on a 
river only a mile and a half wide. 
And no storm is going to help us 
out.” 

He swept the bank with the tele- 
scope as he had been doing ever 
since the fleet set out three years 
ago. He was of medium height and 
had a big head that made his none- 
too-broad shoulders look even more 
narrow. His eyes were blue; his eye- 
brows, shaggy; his nose, Roman. His 
hair was long and reddish brown. 
His face was innocent of the 
mustache that had been so well 
known during his terrestrial life. 
Men had been resurrected without 
face hair. His chest was a sea of 
brown-red curly hair that lapped at 
the hollow of his throat. He wore 
only a knee-length white towel se- 
cured at the waist, a leather belt 
for holding weapons and the sheath 
for his telescope, and leather slip- 
pers. His skin was bronzed by the 
equatorial sun. 

He removed the telescope from 
his eye to look at the enemy ships 
trailing by a mile. As he did so, 
he saw something flash in the sky. 
It was a curving sword of white, 
suddenly appearing as if unsheathed 
from the blue. It stabbed down- 
wards and then was gone behind 
the mountains. 

S am was startled. He had seen 
many small meteorites in the 
night sky but never a large one. Yet 
so brightly burned this one that it 
left an afterimage on his eyes for 
a second or two. Then the image 



faded, and Sam forgot about the 
falling star. ^ He scanned the bank 
again with his telescope. 

This part of the River had been 
typical. On each side of the mile- 
and-a-half-wide river was a mile- 
and-a-half-wide grassgrown plain. On 
each bank, huge mushroom-shaped 
stone structures, the grailstones, 
were spaced a mile apart. Trees 
were few on the plains, but the 
foothills were thick with pine, oak, 
yew and the irontree, a thousand- 
foot-high plant with gray bark, 
enormous elephant-ear leaves, hun- 
dreds of thick gnarly branches, roots 
so deep and wood so hard that the 
tree could not be cut, burned or 
dug out. Vines bearing large flowers 
of many bright colors grew over the 
branches. 

There was a mile or two of foot- 
hills, and then the abruptness of 
smooth-sided mountains, towering 
from 20,000 to 30,000 feet. They 
were unscalable past the 10,000-foot 
mark and forced the traveler to 
follow the river valley if he wished 
to get to his goal. 

The area through which the three 
Norse boats were sailing was in- 
habited largely by early nineteenth- 
century Germans. There was the 
usual ten per cent population from 
another place and time of Earth. 
Here, the ten per cent was first- 
century Persians. And there was also 
the ubiquitous one per cent of seem- 
ingly random choices from any time 
and anyplace. 

The telescope swung past the 
bamboo huts on the plains and the 
faces of the people. The men were 
clad only in various towels; the 



8 



IF 




women, in short towel-like skirts and 
thin cloths around the breasts. There 
were many gathered on the bank, 
apparently to watch the battle. They 
carried flint-tipped spears and bows 
and arrows but were not in martial 
array. 

Clemens grunted suddenly and 
held the telescope on the face of a 
man. At this distance and with the 
weak power of the instrument, he 
could not clearly see the man’s 
features. But the wide-shouldered 
body and dark face suggested 
familiarity. Where had he seen that 
face before? 

Then it struck him. The man 
looked remarkably like the photo- 
graphs of the famous English ex- 
plorer Sir Richard Burton that he’d 
seen on Earth. Rather, there was 
something suggestive of the man. 
Clemens sighed and turned the eye- 
piece to the other faces as the ship 
took him away. He would never 
know the true identity of the fel- 
low. 

He would have liked to put 
ashore and talk to him, find out 
if he really were Burton. In the 
twenty years of life on this river- 
planet, and the seeing of millions of 
faces, Clemens had not yet met one 
person he had known on Earth. He 
did not know Burton personally, but 
he was sure that Burton must have 
heard of him. This man — if he 
were Burton — would be a link, 
if thin, to the dead Earth. 

And then, as a far-off blurred 
figure came within the roimd of 
the telescope, Clemens cried out in- 
credulously. 

“Livy! Oh, my God! Livy!” 



T here could be no doubt. Al- 
though the features could not 
be clearly distinguished, they formed 
an overwhelming, not-to-be-denied 
truth. The head, the hairdo, the fig- 
ure and the unmistakable walk (as 
unique las a fingerprint) shouted out 
that here was his Earthly wife. 

“Livy!” he sobbed. The ship 
heeled to tack, and he lost her. 
Frantically, he swung the end of 
the scope back and forth. 

Eyes wide, he stomped with his 
foot on the deck, and he bellowed, 
“Bloodaxe! Bloodaxe! Up here! Hur- 
ry!” 

He swung towards the helmsman 
and shouted that he should go back 
and direct the ship toward the bank. 
Grimolfsson was taken aback at 
first by Clemens’s vehemence. Then 
he slitted his eyes, shook his head, 
and growled out a no. 

“I order you to!” Clemens 
screamed, forgetting that the helms- 
man did not understand English. 
“That’s my wife! Livy! My beautiful 
Livy, as she was when she was 
twenty-five! Brought back from the 
dead!” 

Someone rumbled behind him, and 
Clemens whirled to see a blond head 
with a shorn-off left ear appear on 
the level of the deck. Then Erik 
Bloodaxe’s broad shoulders, massive 
chest and huge biceps came into 
view, followed by pillarlike thighs 
as he came on up the ladder. He 
wore a green-and-black checked 
towel, a broad belt holding several 
chert knives and a holster for his 
axe. This was of steel, broadbladed 
and with an oak handle. It was, 
as far as Clemens knew, unique on 



THE FELLED STAR 



9 




this planet, where stone and wood 
were the only materials for weapons. 

He frowned as he looked over 
the river. He turned to Clemens and 
said, “What is it, sma-skitligr? You 
made me miscue when you screamed 
like Thor’s bride on her wedding 
night. I lost a cigar to Toki Njals- 
son.” 

He took the axe from its holster 
and swung it. The sun glinted off 
the blue steel. “You had better have 
a good reason for disturbing me. I 
have killed many men for far less.” 
Clemens’s face was pale beneath 
the tan, but this time it was not 
caused by Erik’s threat. He glared, 
the wind-ruffled hair, staring eyes 
and aquiline profile making him 
look like a kestrel falcon. 

“To hell with you and your axe!” 
he shouted. “I just saw my wife, 
Livy, there on the right bank! I 
want ... I demand . that you 
take me ashore so I can be with her 
again! Oh, God, after all these 
years, all this hopeless searching! 
It’ll only take a minute! You can’t 
deny me this; you’d be inhuman to 
do so!” 

The axe whistled and sparkled. 
The Norseman grinned. 

“All this fuss for a woman? What 
about herT^ And he gestured at a 
small dark woman standing near the 
great pedestal and tube of the rocket- 
launcher. 

C lemens became even paler. He 
said, ‘Temah is a fine girl! I’m 
very fond of her! But she’s not 
Livy!” 

“Enough of this,” Bloodaxe said. 
“Do you take me to be as big a 



fool as you? If I put into shore, 
we’d be caught between the ground 
and river forces, ground like meal 
in Freyr’s mill. Forget about her.” 

Clemens screamed like a falcon 
and launched himself, arms out and 
flapping, at the Viking. Erik brought 
the flat of the axe against Clemens’s 
head and knocked him to the deck. 
For several minutes, Clemens lay 
on his back, eyes open and staring 
at the sun. Blood seeped from the 
roots of the hair falling down over 
his face. Then he got to all-fours 
and began to vomit. 

Erik gave an impatient order. 
Temah, her face drawn, eyes look- 
ing sidewise with fright at Erik, 
dipped a bucket at the end of a 
rope into the river. She threw the 
water over Clemens, who sat up and 
then wobbled to his feet. Temah 
drew another bucket and washed 
off the deck. 

Clemens snarled at Erik. Erik 
laugjhed and said, “Little coward, 
you’ve been talking too big for 
too long! Now, you know what hap- 
pens when you talk to Erik Blood- 
axe as if he were a thrall. Con- 
sider yourself lucky. I did not kill 
you.” 

Clemens spun away from Erik, 
staggered to the railing, and be- 
gan to climb upon it. “Livy!” he 
called. 

Swearing, Bloodaxe ran after him, 
seized him around the waist, and 
dragged him back. Then he pushed 
Clemens so heavily that Clemens 
fell on the deck again. 

“You’re not deserting me at this 
time!” Erik said. “I need you to 
find that iron mine!” 



10 



IF 




“There isn . ” Clemens said 
and then closed his mouth tightly. 
Let the Norseman find out that he 
did not know where the mine — 
if there was a mine — was located, 
and he would be killed on the sipot. 

“Moreover,” Erik continued 
cheerfully, “after we find the iron, 
I may need you to help us to- 
wards the Polar Tower, although 
I think I can get there just by 
following the river. But you have 
much knowledge that I need. And 
I can use that frost giant, Joe 
Miller.” 

“Joe!” Clemens said in a thick 
voice. He tried to get back onto 
his feet. “Joe Miller! Where’s Joe? 
He’ll kill you!” 

The axe cut the air above Clem- 
ens’s head. “You will tell Joe noth- 
ing of this, do you hear? I swear by 
Odin’s blind socket, I will get to 
you and kill you before he can put a 
hand on me. Do you hear?” 

Clemens got to his feet and sway- 
ed for a minute. Then he called, 
in a louder voice, “Joe! Joe Miller!” 

II 

A voice from below the poopdeck 
muttered. It was so deep that 
it made the hairs on the backs of 
men’s necks rise even after hearing 
it for the thousandth time. 

The stout bamboo ladder creaked 
beneath a weight, creaked so loud- 
ly it could be heard above the 
sing of wind through leather ropes, 
flapping of membranous sails, grind 
of wooden joints, shouts of crew, 
the hiss of water against the hull. 
The head that rose above the 



edge of the deck was even more 
frightening than the inhumanly deep 
voice. It was large as a half^pohy 
of beer and was all bars and arches 
and shelves and flying buttresses 
of bone beneath a pinkish and loose 
skin. Bone circled eyes, small- 
seeming and dark blue. The nose 
was inappropriate to the rest of his 
features, since it should have been 
flat-bridged and flaring-nostrilled. 
Instead, it was the monstrous and 
comical travesty on the human nose 
that the prob^cis monkey sihows 
to a laughing world. In its lengthy 
shadow was a long upper lip, like 
a chimpanzee’s or comic-strip Irish- 
man’s. The lips were thin and pro- 
truded, shoved out by the convex 
jaws beneath. 

His shoulders made Erik Blood- 
axe’s look like pretzels. Ahead of 
him he pushed a great paunch, a 
balloon trying to rise from the body 
to which it was anchored. His legs 
and arms seemed short; they were 
so out of proportion to the long 
trunk. The juncture of thigh and 
body was level with Sam Clemens’s 
chin, and his arms, extended, could 
hold, and had held, Clemens out at 
arm’s length in the air for an hour 
without a tremor. 

He wore no clothes nor did he 
need them for modesty’s sake, 
though he had not known modesty 
until taught by homo sapiens. Long, 
rusty-red hair, thicker than a man’s, 
less dense than a chimpanzee’s, was 
plastered to the body by his sweat. 
The skin beneath the hairs was the 
dirty-pink of a blond Noric. 

He ran a hand the size of an un- 
abridged dictionary through the 



THE FELLED STAR 



11 




wavy, msty-red hair tihait began an 
inch above the eyes and slanted back 
rapidly. He yawned and showed 
teeth that were human-seeming ex- 
cept for the two five-inch long, 
tigerish canines. 

“I vath thleeping,” he rumbled, 
“I vath dreaming of Earth, of klra- 
vulthithmengbhabafving — vhat you 
call mammothth. Thothe vere the 
good old dayth.” 

He shuffled forward, then stop- 
ped. “Tham! Vhat happened! You’re 
bleeding! You look thick!” 

Bellowing for his guards, Erik 
Bloodaxe stepped backwards from 
the titanthrop. “Your friend went 
mad! He thought he’d seen his wife 
— for the thousandth time — and 
he attacked me because I wouldn’t 
take him in to the bank to her; 
Tyr’s testicles, Joe! You know how 
many times he’s thought he saw that 
woman, and how many times we 
stopped, and how many times it 
always turned out to be a woman 
who looked something like his 
woman but wasn’t! 

“This time, I said no! Even if it 
had been his women, I would have 
said no! We’d be putting our heads 
in the wolfs mouth!” 

Erik crouched, axe lifted, ready 
to swing at the giant. Shouts came 
from middeck, and a big redhead 
with a flint axe ran up the ladder. 
The helmsman gesfured for him to 
leave. The redhead, seeing Joe Mil- 
ler so belligerant, did not hesitate to 
retreat. 

“Vhat you thay, Tham?” Miller 
said. “Thyould I tear him apart?” 

Clemens held his head in both 
hands and said, “No. He’s right. 



I suppose. I don’t really know if she 
was Livy. Probably just a German 
hausfrau? I don’t know!” 

He groaned. “I don’t know! May- 
be it was her!” 

Wooden horns blared, and a huge 
drum on the middeck thundered. 
Sam Clemens said, “Forget about 
this, Joe, until we get through the 
straits — if we do get through! 
If we’re to survive, we’ll have to 
fight together. Later ...” 

“You alvayth thay later, Tham, 
but there never ith a later. Vhy?” 

“If you can’t figure diat out, Joe, 
you’re as dumb as you look!” Clem- 
ens snapped. 

Tearshields glinted in Joes’s eyes, 
and his bulging cheeks became wet. 

“Every time you get thcared, you 
call me dumb,” he said. “Vhy take 
it out on me? Vhy not on the people 
that thcare you, vhy not on Blood- 
akthe?” 

“I apologize, Joe,” Clemens said. 
“Out of the mouths of babes and 
apemen .... You’re not so dumb, 
you’re pretty smart. Forget it, Joe. 
I’m sorry.” 

Bloodaxe swaggered up to them 
but kept out of Joe’s reach. He 
grinned as he swung his axe. “There 
shall soon be a meeting of the me- 
tair And then he laughed and said, 
“What am I saying? Battle any more 
is the meeting of stone and wood, 
except for my star-axe, of course! 
But what does that matter? I have 
grown tired of these six months of 
peace. I need the cries of war, the 
whistling spear, the chunk of my 
sharp steel biting into flesh, the 
spurt of blood. I have become as 
impatient as a penned-up stallion

IF 




who smells a mare in heat; I would 
mate with Death.” 

“Bull!” Joe Miller said. “You’re 
jutht ath bad ath Tham in your 
vay. You’re thcared, too, but you 
cover it up vith your big mouth.” 

“I do not understand your man- 
gled speech,” Bloodaxe said. “Apes 
should not attempt the tongue of 
man.” 

“You understand me all right,” 
Joe said. 

“Keep quiet, Joe,” Clemens said. 
He looked upriver. Two miles away, 
the plains on each side of the river 
dwindled away as the mountains 
curved inwards to create straits not 
more than a quarter-mile wide. The 
water boiled at the bottom of the 
cliffs, which were perhaps 3,000 
feet high. On the cliff-tops, on both 
sides, unidentified objects glittered 
in the sun. 

A half-mile below the straits, thir- 
ty galleys had formed three cres- 
cents. And, aided by the swift cur- 
rent and sixty oars each, they were 
speeding towards the three intrud- 
ers. Clemens viewed them through 
his telescope and then said, “Each 
has about forty warriors aboard and 
two rocket-launchers. We’re in a 
hell of a trap. And our own rockets 
have been in storage so long, the 
powder’s likely to be crystallized. 
They’ll go off in the tubes and blow 
us to kingdom come. 

“And those things on top of the 
cliffs. Apparatus for projecting 
Greek fire?” 

A man brought the king’s armor: 
a triple-layered leather helmet with 
imitation leather wings and a nose- 
piece, a leather cuirass, leather 



breeches and a shield. Another man 
brought a bundle of spears: yew 
shafts and flint tips. 

The rocket crew, all women, 
placed a projectile in the swivable 
launching tube. The rocket was six 
feet long, not counting the guide- 
stick, built of bamboo, and looked 
exactly like a Fourth of July rock- 
et. Its warhead contained twenty 
pounds of black gunpowder in which 
were many tiny chips of stone: 
shrapnel. 

J oe Miller, the deck creaking be- 
neath his 800 pounds, went be- 
low to get his armor and weapons. 
Clemens put on a helmet and slung 
a shield over his shoulder, but he 
would not use a cuirass or leggings. 
Although he feared wounds, he was 
even more frightened of drowning 
because of the heavy armor if he 
fell into the river. 

Clemens thanked whatever gods 
there were that he had been lucky 
enough to fall in with Joe Miller. 
They were blood-brothers now — 
even if Clemens had fainted during 
the ceremony, which demanded 
mingling of blood and some even 
more painful and repulsive acts. 
Miller was to defend him, and 
Clemens was to defend Miller to the 
death. So far, the 'titanthrop had 
done all the battling. But then he 
was more than big enough for two. 

Bloodaxe’s dislike of Miller was 
caused by envy. Bloodaxe fancied 
himself as the world’s greatest fight- 
er and yet knew that Miller would 
have no more trouble dispatching 
him in combat than Miller would 
with a dog. 



THE FELLED STAR 



13 




And with a small dog at that. 

Erik Bloodaxe gave his battle or- 
ders, which were transmitted to the 
other two ships by flashes of sun- 
light off obsidian mirrors. The ships 
would keep sails up and try to 
steer between the galleys. This 
would be difficult because a ship 
might have to change course to 
avoid ramming and so lose the 
wind. Also, each ship would thrice 
be subjected to crossfire. 

“The wind’s with them,” Clemens 
said. “Their rockets will have more 
range until we’re among them.” 

“Teach your grandmother to suck 
...” Bloodaxe said and stopped. 

Some bright objects on the cliff- 
tops had left their positions and now 
were swooping through the air in 
a path that would bring them close 
above the Vikings. The Norsemen 
shouted with bewilderment and 
alarm, but Clemens recognized them 
as gliders. In as few words as 
possible, he explained to Bloodaxe. 
The king started to relay the in- 
formation to the other Vikings but 
had to stop because the lead gal- 
leys fired off the first volley of 
rockets. Wobbling, trailing thick 
black smoke, ten rockets arced to- 
wards the three sailships. These 
changed course as quickly as possi- 
ble, two almost colliding. Some of 
the rockets almost struck the masts 
or the hulls, but none hit and all 
splashed unexploded, falling into the 
river. 

By then the first of the gliders 
made its pass. Slim-fuselaged, long- 
winged, with black Maltese crosses 
on the sides of its slim and silvery 
fuselage, it dived at a 45- degree an- 



gle towards the Dreyrugr, The 
Norsemen archers bent their yew 
bows an3, at a command from the 
chief archer, loosed their shafts. 

The glider swooped low over the 
water, several arrows sticking out 
of the fuselage, and it settled down 
for a landing on the river. It had 
failed to drop its bombs on the 
Dreyrugr. They were somewhere be- 
low the surface. 

But now other gliders were com- 
ing in at all three ships, and the 
enemy lead galleys had loosed an- 
other flight of rockets. Clemens 
glanced at their own rocket-launcher. 
The big blonde crew-women were 
swiveling the tube under the com- 
mand of small dark Temah, but she 
was not ready to touch the fuse yet. 
The Dreyrugr was not yet within 
range of the nearest galley. 

For a second, everything was as 
if suspended in a photograph: the 
two gHders, their wingtips only two 
feet apart, pulling up out of the dive 
and the small black bombs dropping 
towards the decks of their targets, 
the arrow halfway towards the glid- 
ers, the German rockets halfway to- 
ward the Viking ships, on the down- 
curve of their arcs. 

Clemens felt the sudden push of 
wind behind him, a whistling, an 
explosion as the sails took the full 
impact of air and rolled the ship 
over sharply on its longitudinal axis. 
There was a tearing sound as if the 
fabric of the world were being rip- 
ped apart; a cracking as if great 
axes had slammed into the masts. 

T he bombs, the gliders, the roc- 
kets, the arrows were lifted up- 



14 



IF

wards and backwards, turned upside 
down. The sails and masts left the 
ship as if they had been launched 
from tubes and soared away. The 
ship, released from the push of sail, 
rolled back to horizontal from an 
almost 90-degree angle to the river. 
Clemens was saved from flying off 
the deck in the first slam of wind 
only because the titanthrop had 
seized the wheel with one hand and 
clutched him with the other. The 
helmsman had also clung to the 
wheel. The rocket crew, their shrieks 
carried upriver by the wind, mouths 
open, hair whipping, flew like birds 
from the ship, soared and then 
splashed into the river. The rocket 
tube tore loose from its pedestal and 
followed them. 

Bloodaxe had grabbed the rail- 
ing with one hand and kept hold 
of his precious steel weapon with 
the other. While the ship rocked 
back and forth, he managed to 
stick the axehandle in the holster 
and then to cling to the railing with 
both hands. It was well for him 
that he did, because the wind was 
screaming like a woman fallmg off 
a cliff and shoving powerfully at 
him. Within a few seconds, a hot 
blast tore at the ship, and Clemens 
was as deafened and as seared as 
if he were standing near a rocket 
blast. 

A great swell of riverwater lifted 
the ship high. Clemens opened his 
eyes and then screamed but could 
not hear his own voice because of 
his stunned ears. 

A wall of dirty brown water, at 
least fifty feet high, was racing 
around the curve of the valley be- 



tween four and five miles away. He 
wanted to close his eyes again but 
could not. He continued to gaze 
with his lids rigid until the elevated 
sea was a mile away. Then he could 
make out the individual trees, the 
giant pines, oaks, and yews scat- 
tered along the front of the wave, 
and, as it got closer, pieces of 
bamboo and pine houses, a roof 
somehow still intact, a shattered hull 
with a half mast, the sperm-whale- 
sized, dark-gray body of a river- 
dragon fish, plucked from the five- 
hundred feet depths of the river. 

Terror numbed him. He wanted 
to die to escape the death. But he 
could not, and so he watched with 
frozen eyes and congealed mind as 
the ship, instead of being drowned 
and smashed beneath hundreds of 
thousands of gallons of water, rose 
up and up and up on the slope of 
the wave, up and up, the dirty 
brown wreckage-strewn cliff tow- 
ering above, always threatening to 
avalanche down upon the ship, and 
the sky above, now turned from 
bright noon-blue to gray. 

Then they were on the top, poised 
for a downward slide, rocked, dip- 
ped, and went down towards the 
trough. Smaller waves, but still huge, 
fell over the boat. A body landed 
on the deck near Clemens, a body 
catapulted from the raging waters. 
Clemens stared at it with only a 
spark of comprehension. He was too 
iced with terror to feel any more; 
he had reached the limits. 

And so he stared at Livy’s body, 
smashed on one side but untouch^ 
on the other side! It was Livy, his 
wife, that he had seen. 



16 



IF 




Then another wave that almost 
tore him and the titanthrop loose 
struck the deck. The helmsman 
screamed as he lost his grip and 
followed the woman’s corpse over- 
board. 

The boat, sliding upwards from 
the depths of the trough, turned to 
present its broadside to the wave. 
But the boat continued to soar up- 
wards, though it tilted so that Miller 
and Clemens were hanging from the 
stump of the wheel’s base as if 
they were dangling from a tree 
trunk on the face of a mountain. 
Then the boat rolled back to hori- 
zontal position as it raced down the 
next valley. Bloodaxe had lost his 
grip and was shot across the deck 
and would have gone over the other 
side if the ship had not righted 
itself in time. Now he clung to the 
port railing. 

On top of the third wave, the 
Dreyrugr sped slantwise down the 
mountain of water. It struck the 
broken forepart of another vessel, 
shuddered, and Bloodaxe’s grip was 
town loose by the impact. He spun 
along the railing, hit the other rail- 
ing on the edge of the poopdeck, 
shattered it, and went on over the 
edge and below to the middeck. 
Thereafter, Clemens did not see him. 

Ill 

N ot until morning of the next 
day did Sam Clemens thaw out 
of his shock. The Dreyrugr had 
somehow ridden out the great waves 
long enough to go slanting across 
the plains on the shallower but 
rough waters. It had been shot past 



hills and through a narrow pass 
into a small canyon at the base 
of the mountain. And as the waters 
subsided from beneath it, the boat 
had settled with a crash into the 
ground. 

The crew lay in terror thick as 
cold mud while the river and wind 
raged and the sky remained the 
color of chilling iron. Then the 
winds ceased. Rather the downriver 
winds stopped, and the normal 
soothing wind from upriver re- 
sumed. 

Some of the men and women be- 
gan to stir and to ask questions. Sam 
felt as if he could barely force the 
words out through a numbed mouth. 
Stammering, he told them of the 
flash he had seen in the sky fifteen 
minutes before the winds struck. 
Somewhere down the valley, maybe 
two hundred miles away, a giant 
meteorite had struck. The winds 
created by the heat of passage 
through the air and by the dis- 
placement of air by the meteorite, 
the shock waves caused by the im- 
pact, had generated those giant 
waves. Terrible as they were, they 
must have been pygmies compared 
to those nearer the point of im- 
pact. Actually, the Dreyrugr was in 
the outer edge of the fury. 

“It had quit being mad and 
was getting downright jovial when 
we met it,” Sam said. 

Some of the Norse got unsteadily 
to their feet and tottered across the 
deck. Some belowdecks stuck their 
heads out of the hatches. Bloodaxe 
was hurting from his roll across 
the deck, but he managed to roar, 
“Everybody belowdecks! There will 



THE FELLED STAR 



17 




be another great flood, much worse 
than this one, when the waves caus- 
ed by the falling star hitting the 
earth reach us!” 

Sam did not like Bloodaxe, to 
put it mildly, yet he had to admit 
that the Norwegian was bright 
enough when it came to the ways 
of water. He himself had supposed 
that the first waves would be the 
last. 

The crew lay down in the hold 
wherever they could find space and 
something stable to hang onto, and 
they waited. Sometime during the 
night, the earth rumbled and shook, 
and then the river struck the pass 
with a hiss like a fifty-foot-high cat, 
followed by a bellow. Borne upwards 
by the flood pouring through the 
pass, the Dreyrugr rocked and spun 
around and around as it rocked. Sam 
turned cold. He was sure that if 
there had been daylight, he and 
the others would look as grayblue as 
corpses. 

U ip the boat went, occasionally 
scraping against the walls of the 
canyon. Just as Sam was about to 
swear that the Dreyrugr had reached 
the top of the canyon and was going 
to be carried over its front in a 
cataract, the boat dropped. It sank 
swiftly, or so it seemed, while the 
waters poured out through the pass 
almost as quickly as they had en- 
tered. There was a crash, followed 
by the heavy breathing of men and 
women, a groan here and there, the 
dripping of water, and the far away 
roar of the receding river. 

It was not over yet. There was 
more waiting in cold numb terror 



until the great mass of water would 
rush back to fill the spaces from 
which i^ had been displaced by 
the blazing many hundreds of 
thousands of tons mass of the me- 
teorite. They shivered as if encased 
in ice, although the air was far 
warmer than it had even been at 
this time of night. And for the first 
time in the twenty years on this 
planet, it did not rain at night. 

Before the waters struck again, 
they felt the shake and grumble of 
earth. There was a vast hiss and a 
roar, and again the boat rose up, 
spun, bumped against the walls of 
the canyon and then sank. This time, 
the ship did not strike the ground 
so haid, probably, Sam thought, 
because the boat had hit a thick 
layer of mud. 

“I don’t believe in miracles,” Sam 
whispered, “but this is one. We’ve 
no business being alive.” 

Joe Miller, who had recovered 
more swiftly than the others from 
shock, returned from a scouting 
trip. He carried in his arms the nak- 
ed body of a man. His burden was, 
however, alive. He had blond hair 
under the mud-streaks, a handsome 
face and blue-gray eyes. He said 
something in German to Clemens 
and then managed to smile after he 
had been deposited gently on the 
deck. 

“I found him in hith glider,” 
Joe said. “Vhat vath left of it, that 
ith. There’th a number of corptheth 
loutthide thith canyon. Vhat you 
vant to do vith him?” 

“Make friends with him,” Clem- 
ens croaked. “His people are gone; 
this area is cleaned out.” 



18 



IF 




He shuddered. Tlie image of Livy’s 
body placed on the deck like a 
mocking gift, the wet hair plastered 
over one side of her smashed face, 
the one dark eye staring darkly at 
him, was getting more vivid and 
more painful. He felt like sobbing 
but could not and was glad of it. 
Weeping would make him fall apart 
into a cone of ashes. Later, when 
he had the strength to stand it, 
he would weep. So near .... 

The blond man sat up on the 
deck. He shivered uncontrollably 
and said, in British English, “I’m 
cold.” 

Miller went belowdecks and 
brought up dried fish, acorn bread, 
bamboo tips and cheese. The Vik- 
ings had stored food to eat when 
they were in hostile areas where they 
were forbidden to use their grails. 

“That thtupid ath, Bloodakthe, ith 
thtill alive,” Miller said. “He’th got 
theme broken ribth and he’th a meth 
of bruitheth and cutth. But hith big 
mouth ith in perfect working order. 
Vouldn’t you know it?” 

A fter he had eaten, Clemens be- 
gan crying. Joe Miller wept 
with him and blew his huge probos- 
cis. 

“There,” he said, “I feel much 
better. I never been tho thscared in 
all my life. Vhen I thaw that vater, 
like all the mammothth in the vorld 
thtampeding towardth uth, I thought. 
Good-by, Joe. Good-by, Tham. I’ll 
vake up thomevhere along the river 
in a new body, but I’ll never thee 
you again, Tham. Only I vath too 
terrified to feel thad about it. Yeth- 
uth, I vath thcared!” 



The young stranger introduced 
himself. He was Lothar von Rich- 
thofen, glider pilot, captain of the 
Luftwaffe of his Imperial Majesty, 
Kaiser Alfred the First of New 
Prussia. 

“We’ve passed a hundred New 
Prussias in the last ten thousand 
miles,” Clemens said. “All so small 
you couldn’t stand in the middle of 
one and heave a brick without it 
landing in the middle of the next. 
But most of them weren’t as bellig- 
erent as yours. They’d let us land 
and charge our grails, especially 
after we’d shown them what we 
had to trade for use of the stones.” 

“Trade?” 

“Yes. We didn’t trade goods, of 
course, because all the freighters of 
old Earth couldn’t carry enough to 
last out a fraction of the river. We 
traded ideas. For one thing, we show 
these people how to build pool 
tables and how to make a hair-set- 
ting spray from fish-glue, deodor- 
ized.” 

The Kaiser of this area had been, 
on Earth, a Count von Waldersee, 
a German field marshal, bom 1832, 
died 1904. 

Clemens nodded, saying, “I re- 
member reading about his death in 
the papers and having great satis- 
faction because I had outlived an- 
other contemi>orary. That was one 
of the few genuine and free pleas- 
ures of life. But since you know 
how to fly, you must be a twentieth- 
century German, right?” 

Lother von Richthofen gave a 
brief summary of his life. He had 
flown a fighter plane for Germany 
in the Weltkrieg. His brother had 



THE FELLED STAR 



19 




been the greatest of aces on either 
side during that war. 

“World War I or II?” Clemens 
said. He had met enough 20th-cen- 
turians to know some facts — and 
fancies — about events after his 
death in 1910. 

V on Richthofen added more de- 
tails. He had been in World War 
I. He himself had fought under his 
brother and had accounted for forty 
Allied planes. In 1922, while fly- 
ing an American film actress and 
her manager from Hamburg to Ber- 
lin, the plane had crashed and he 
had died. “The luck of Lothar von 
Richthofen deserted me,” he said. 
“Or so I thought then.” He laugh- 
ed. “But here I am, twenty-five years 
old in body again, and I missed the 
sad things about growing old, when 
women no longer look at you, when 
wine makes you weep instead of 
laugh and makes your mouth sour 
with the taste of impotence and 
every day is one day nearer to death. 

“And my luck held out again 
when that meteorite struck. My 
glider lost its wings at the first blow 
of wind, but instead of falling, I 
floated in my fuselage, turning over 
and over, dropping, rising again, 
falling, until I was deposited as 
lightly as a sheet of pap>er upon a 
hill. And when the backflood came, 
the fuselage was borne by the 
water and I was nuzzled gently 
against the foot of the mountain. 
A miracle!” 

“A miracle: a chance distribution 
of events, occurring one time in 
a billion,” Clemens said. “You think 
a giant meteor caused that flood?” 



“I saw its flash, the trail of burn- 
ing air. It must have crashed far 
away, fortunaftly for us.” 

They climbed down from the ship 
and slogged through the thick mud 
to the canyon entrance. Joe Miller 
heaved logs that a team of draft 
horses would have strained to pull. 
He shoved aside others, and the 
three went down through the foot- 
hills and to the plains. Others fol- 
lowed them. 

They were silent now. The land 
had been scoured free of trees except 
for the great irontrees. So deeply 
rooted were these that most stiU 
stood upright. Moreover, where the 
mud had not settled, there was grass. 
It was a testimony to the toughness 
and steadfast-rootedness of the 
grass that the millions of tons of 
water had not been able to rip 
out the topsoil. 

Here and there was the flotsam 
left by the backflood. Corpses of 
men and women, broken timber, 
towels, grails, a dugout, uprooted 
pines and oaks and yews. 

The great mushroom-shaped grail- 
stones, spaced a mile apart along 
the banks on both sides, were also 
unbroken and unbent, although 
many were almost buried in mud. 

“The rains will eventually take 
care of the mud,” Clemens said. 
“The land slopes towards the river.” 
He avoided the corpses. They filled 
him with a prickly loathing. Be- 
sides, he was afraid that he might 
see Livy’s body again. He did not 
think he could stand it; he would 
go mad. 

“One thing sure,” Sam Clemens 
said. “There’ll be nobody between 



20 



IF 




US and the meteorite. We’ll have 
first claim on it, and then it’ll be 
up to us to defend all that treasure 
of iron from the wolves that will 
come loping on its scent. 

“Would you like to join up? If 
you stick with me, you’ll have an 
airplane some day, not just a glider.” 

V on Richthofen was more than 
curious, Sam explained a little 
about his Dream. And he told a lit- 
tle about Joe Miller’s story of the 
Misty Tower. 

“It’s only possible with a great 
deal of iron,” he said. “And much 
hard work. These Vikings aren’t 
capable of helping me build a steam- 
boat. I need technical knowledge 
they don’t have. But I was using 
them to get me to a possible source 
of iron. I had hoped that there might 
be enough ore from which Erik’s 
axe was made for my purpose. I 
used their greed for the metal, and 
also Miller’s story, to launch them 
on this expedition. 

“Now, we don’t have to search. 
We know where there must be more 
than enough. All we have to do 
is dig it up, melt it, refine it, shape 
it into the forms we need. And pro- 
tect it. I won’t string you along with 
a tale of easy accomplishment. It 
may take years before we can com- 
plete the boat, and it’ll be damn 
hard work doing it.” 

Lothar’s face blazed with a spark 
caught from Clemens’s few words. 
“It’s a noble, magnificent dream!” 
he said. “Yes, I’d like to join you. 
I’ll pledge my honor to follow you 
until we storm Misty Tower! On 
my word as a gentleman and officer, 



on the blood of the barons of Rich- 
thofen!” 

“Just give me your word as a 
man,” Sam said drily. 

“What a strange — indeed, un- 
thinkable — trio we make!” Lothar 
said. “A gigantic subhuman, who 
must have died at least 100,000 
years before civilization. A twentieth- 
century Prussian baron and aviator. 
A great American humorist born in 
1835. And our crew — ” Clemens 
raised his thick eyebrows at the our 
— “tenth-century Vikings!” 

“A sorry lot now,” Sam said, 
watching Bloodaxe and the others 
plow through the mud. All were 
bruised from head to foot and many 
limped. “I don’t feel so well my- 
self. Have you ever watched a Jap- 
anese tenderize a dead octopus? I 
know how the octopus feels now. 
By the way, I was more than just 
a humorist, you know. I was a man 
of letters.” 

“Ah, forgive men!” Lothar said. 
“I’ve hurt your feelings. No offense. 
Let me salve your injuries, Mr. 
Clemens, by telling you that when 
I was a boy, I laughed many times 
reading your books. And I regard 
your Huckleberry Finn as a great 
book. Although I must admit I did 
not care for the way you ridiculed 
the aristocracy in your Connecticut 
Yankee, Still, they were English, and 
you are an American.” 

Erik Bloodaxe decided that they 
were too battered and weary to 
start the job of getting the ship 
down to the river that day. They 
would charge their grails at eve- 
ning, eat, sleep, eat breakfast and 
then begin the backbreaking work. 



THE FELLED STAR 



21 




They went back to the ^p, took 
their grails from the hold and set 
them on the depressions on the flat 
top of a grailsitone. As the sun 
touched the peaks of the movmtains 
to the west, the men awaited the 
roar and the hot, blue flash from the 
stones. The electrical discharge 
would power the energy-matter 
converters within the false bottoms 
of the grail and, on opening the 
lids, the men would find cooked 
meats, vegetables, bread and but- 
ter, fruit, tobacco, dreamgum, liquor 
or mead. 

But as darkness settled over the 
valley, the grailstones remained 
silent and cold. Across the river, fire 
sprang up momentarily from the 
gallstones there, and a faint roar 
reached them. 

But the stones on the west bank, 
for the first time in the twenty 
years since the day of Resurrection, 
did not function. 

IV 

T he men and women felt as if 
God had failed them. The three- 
times-a-day offering of the stones 
had come to seem as natural as the 
rising of the sun. It was some time 
before they could ease the sickness 
in their stomachs to eat the last 
of the fish, sprouts and cheese. 

Clemens was in a blue funk for a 
while. But von Richthofen began 
talking of the necessity of ferrying 
the grails to the other side so they 
could eat in the morning. Presently 
Clemens got up and talked to Blood- 
axe. The. Norwegian was in a mood 
even fouler than usual, but he final- 



ly admitted that action must be 
taken. Joe Miller, \he German, and 
a big redheaded Swede named 
Toke Kroksson trudged back up 
to the ship and then carried some 
oars back down. These three, with 
Clemens, took the grails across in 
the dugout; and Toke and Joe Miller 
paddled the dugout back. Miller, 
Clemens and von Richthofen settled 
down to sleep on top of a grail- 
stone. It was clean, since the elec- 
trical discharge had burned off all 
the mud. 

“We’ll have to get under the 
stone when the rains come,” Clem- 
ens said. He lay on his back, his 
hands under his head, and looked up 
at the night sky. It was no terrestrial 
sky, this blaze of twenty thousand 
stars greater than Venus in her 
glory and shimmering filaments 
tentacling out from glittering gas 
clouds. Some of the stars were so 
bright, that they could be seen as 
pale phantoms even at noon. 

“The meteorite must have smash- 
ed some of the grailstones on the 
west bank,” Sam Clemens said. 
“And so it broke the circuit. My 
God, what a circuit! There must 
be at least twenty million stones 
hooked together, if the calculations 
of some are correct.” 

“There will be a terrible conflict 
raging up and down the river,” 
Lothar said. “The west bankers will 
attack the east bankers so they can 
charge their grails. What a war! I’ve 
heard that there must be about 35 
to 37 billion people in this river- 
valley. All battling to the death for 
food.” 

“The hell of it ith,” Joe Miller

IF 




said, “that if half get kilt and tho 
there’th enough room on the grail- 
stoneth, it von’t do no good. Tventy- 
four hourth later, the dead vill 
all be alife again, and it’ll all thtart 
over again.” 

Sam said, “I’m not so sure. I 
think it’s been established that the 
stones have something to do with 
the resurrections. And if half of 
them are out of commission, there 
may be a considerable cut in pro- 
duction on the Lazarus line. This 
meteorite is a saboteur from the 
skies.” 

44T’ve thought for a long time 

Xthat this world, and our res- 
urrection, are not the work of sup- 
ernatural beings,” von Richthofen 
said. “Have you heard the wild tale 
that’s been going up and down the 
river? There’s a story that one man 
woke up before Resurrection Day 
and found himself in a very weird 
place. There were millions of bodies 
around him, floating in the air, nude 
men, women, and children, their 
heads shaved, all slowly rotating 
under some invisible force. This man, 
an Englishman named Perkin, or 
Burton, some say, had died on Earth 
around 1890. He got loose but was 
intercepted by two beings — human 
— who put him back to sleep. Then 
he awoke, like the rest of us, on 
the banks of the river. 

“Whoever is behind all this isn’t 
infallible. They made a mistake with 
Burton. He got a glimpse into pre- 
Resurreotion, a stage somewhere 
between our death on Earth and 
preparation for life on this world. I 
don’t know. It sounds fantastic, like 



a wish-fulfillment story. But then 
again . .” 

“I’ve heard it,” Sam Clemens, said. 
He thought of telling about seeing 
Burton’s face through the telescope 
just before he spotted Livy’s. But he 
had seen several faces that he had 
thought were Livy’s, and they had 
turned out to be somebody else’s. 
Moreover, the pain of thinking 
about her was too much for him. 

He sat up and cursed and shook 
his fist at the stars and then be- 
gan to weep. Joe Miller, squatting 
behind him, reached a gigantic hand 
out and touched him softly on the 
shoulder. Von Richthofen, embar- 
rassed, looked the other way. Pres- 
ently, he said, “I’ll be glad when 
our grails are charged. I’m itch- 
ing for a smoke.” 

Clemens laughed and dried his 
tears and said, “I don’t cry easily. 
But I’ve gotten over being asham^ 
about it when I do. 

“It’s a sad world, just as sad, in 
most ways, as the old Earth. Yet 
we have our youthful bodies again, 
we don’t have to work for food or 
worry about paying bills, making 
our women pregnant, catching 
diseases. And if we’re killed we rise 
up the following day, whole and 
hearty, although thousands of miles 
from where we died. 

“But it’s nothing like what the 
preachers said it would be. Which 
isn’t, of course, surprising. And 
maybe it’s just as well. Who’d want 
to fly around on aerodynamical ly 
unstable wings or stand around all 
day playing harps badly and 
screeching out hosannas?” 

Lothar laughed and said, “Ask 



THE FELLED STAR

any Chinese or Indian coolie if this 
isn’t a hell of a better world than 
the last world. It’s just us spoiled 
modem Westerners who grumble and 
look for first and latest causes. We 
didn’t know much about the opera- 
tion of our Earthly cosmos, and we 
know less about this. But we’re here, 
and we may eventually find out who 
put us here and why. Meanwhile, as 
long as there are beautiful and will- 
ing women — and there are — 
cigars, dreamgum, wine and a good 
fight, who cares? I’ll enjoy this val- 
ley of bright shadows until the good 
things of life are once more taken 
from me. Lust to lust until it’s dust 
to dust.” 

They were silent after a while, 
and Clemens could not get to sleep 
until just before the rains. He got 
down under the mushroom until 
the downpour ceased. Back on top 
of the stone, he shivered and turned 
for several hours, although he was 
covered with long heavy towels. 
Dawn came with Miller’s ponderous 
hand shaking him. Hastily, he 
climbed down off the stone and got 
a safe distance from it. Five min- 
utes later, the stone gave forth a 
blue flame that leaped thirty feet 
into the air and roared like a lion. 

At the same time, the stones 
across the river bellowed. 

Clemens looked at Lothar. “Some- 
body repaired the break.” 

Lothar said, “I’ve got goose pim- 
ples. Who is somebody?” He was 
silent for a while, but before they 
had reached the west bank, he was 
laughing and chattering like a guest 
at a cc^ktail party. Too cheerful, 
Clemens thought. 



“They’ve never shown their hand 
before, that I know of,” Sam said. 
“But diis time I guess they had to.” 

V 

T he next five days were occupied 
in getting the ship down to the 
bank. Two weeks more were spent 
in repairing the Dreyrugr, All that 
time a watch was kept, but no one 
came into the area. When the ship 
was finally launched, still minus 
masts and sails, and was rowed 
down the river, there was not a live 
human in sight. 

The crew, accustomed to seeing 
the plains thronged with men and 
women, were uneasy. The silence 
was unnerving. There were no ani- 
mals on this world except for the 
fish in the river and earthworms 
in the soil, but the humans had al- 
ways made enough noise. 

“The hyenas’ll be here soon 
enough,” Clemens said to Blood- 
axe. “That iron is far more precious 
than gold ever was on Earth. You 
want battle? You’ll get enough down 
your throat to make you vomit.” 
The Norseman, swinging his axe, 
winced at the pain in his ribs. “Let 
them come! T^iey’!! know they’ve 
been in a fight to bring joy to 
the hearts of the Valkyrie!” 

“Bull!” Joe Miller said. Sam 
smiled but walked to a position be- 
hind the titanthrop. Bloodaxe was 
afraid of only one being in the 
world, but he might lose his never 
easily controlled temper and go ber- 
serk. However, he needed Miller, 
who was worth twenty great but 
human warriors. 



24 



IF 




The ship travelled steadily for two 
days during the sunlit hours. At 
night, one man steered and a small 
watch was kept, the crew slept. Ear- 
ly in the evening of the third day, 
the titanthrop, Clemens and von 
Richthofen were sitting on the fore- 
deck, smoking cigars and sipping at 
the whiskey their grails had given 
them at the last stop. 

“Why do you call him Joe Mil- 
ler?” Lothar asked. 

“His real name is a rattling jaw- 
breaker, longer than the technical 
term of a German philosopher,” 
Clemens said. “I couldn’t pronounce 
it when I first met him, I never did. 
After he learned enough English to 
tell me a joke — he was so eager 
he could hardly wait — I decided 
to call him Joe Miller. He told me 
a tale so hoary I couldn’t believe 
it. I knew it’d been around a long 
time; I first heard it, in a slightly 
different form, when I was a boy in 
Hannibal, Missouri. And I was still 
hearing it, much to my disgust, for 
the hundred thousandth time, when 
I was an old man. But to have to 
listen to that story from the lips 
of a man who’d died one hundred 
thousand years, maybe a million, be- 
fore I was born!” 

“And the story?” 

“Well, there was this traveling 
hunter who’d been tracking a wound- 
ed deer all day. Night came and 
with it a violent storm. Seeing the 
light of a fire, the hunter stopped 
off kt a cave. He asked the old 
medicine man who lived in it if he 
could spend the night there. And the 
old medicine man said, ‘Sure, but 
we’re pretty crowded here. You’ll 



have to sleep with my daughter.’ 
Need I go any fu^er?” 

“Tham didn’t laugh,” Joe rum- 
bled. “Thometimeth I think he ain’t 
got a thenthe of humor.” 

Clemens tweaked Joe’s projectile- 
shaped nose affectionately. He said, 
“Thometimeth I think you’re right. 
But actualy I’m the most humorous 
man in the world because I’m the 
most sorrowful. Every laugh is root- 
ed in pain.” 

H e puffed on his cigar for a 
while and stared at the shore. 
Just before dusk, the ship had en- 
tered the area where the last of the 
intense heat from the meteorite had 
struck. Aside from the few iron- 
trees, everything had been whistled 
off in a shock of searing flame. The 
irontrees had given up their huge 
leaves to the flames, and even the 
enormously resistant bark had 
burned off and the wood beneath, 
harder than granite, had become 
charred. Moreover, the blast had 
tilted or leveled many of these, 
snapping them off at the base. The 
grailstones had been blackened and 
were out of plumb but had re- 
tained their shape. 

Finally, he said, “Lothar, now is 
as good a time as any for you to 
learn something of why we’re on 
this quest. Joe can tell it in his way; 
I’ll explain anything you don’t un- 
derstand. It’s a strange tale, but no 
stranger, actually, than anything 
that’s happened here since we all 
woke up from the dead.” 

“I’m thirthty,’’ Joe said. “Let me 
get a drink firtht.” 

The dark-blue eyes, shadowed in 



26 



IF 




the bone rings, focused upon the 
hollow of the cup. He seemed to 
peer therein as if he were trying 
to conjure up the scenes he was 
about to describe. Guttural, his 
tongue hitting certain consonants 
harder than others, thus giving his 
English a clanging quality, yet com- 
ical with its lisping, voice rising up 
from a chest deep and resonants 
as the well of the Delphian oracle, 
he told of the Misty Tower. 

“Thomevhere upon The River, I 
avoke, naked ath I am now. I vath in 
a plathe that mutht be far north on 
thith planet, because it vath colder 
and the light vath not ath bright.

And I vould have been happy there

“He means ship,” Sam said. 
“That’th what I thaid. Thyip. 
Pleathe don’t interrupt, Tham. 
You’ve made me unhappy enough 
by telling me that there are no 
godth. Even if I’ve theen the godth.” 
Lothar said, “Seen the godsT^ 
“Not egthactly. I thaw vhere they 
live. I did thee their thlip.” 

Von Richthofen said, “What? 
What’re you talking about?” 



Clemens waved his cigar. “Later. 
Let him talk. If you interrupt him 
too much, he gets confused.” 

“Vhere I come from, you don’t 
talk vhile another ith talking. Other- 
vithe, you get punched in the 
nothe.” 

Sam said, “With a nose as big as 
yours, Joe, that must hurt.” 

Miller delicately stroked his pro- 
boscis. 

“It ith the only vone I have, and 
I’m proud of it. Novhere in thith 
part of the valley hath any pigmy 
got a nothe like mine. Vhere I come 
from, your nothe indicateth the tithe 
of your — vhat’th your vord for it, 
Tham?” 

Sam choked and took the cigar 
from his lips. 

“You were telling us of the ship, 
Joe.” 

“Yeth. No! I vath not! I hadn’t 
gotten to it yet. But ath I vath thay-

C lemens, listening, felt again as he 
had when he first heard the 
story. He felt as if he were standing 
by the side of this creature from 
the dawn of man. Despite the clang- 
ing and lisping and halting and 
slow groping after words, this Titan 
spoke impressively. Clemens could 
feel his panic and his wonder and al- 
most overpowering urge to run 
away. Clemens could also feel the 
.opposing urge, the primate’s curios- 
ity, the thing that made him, if 
not wholly a man, at least a near- 
cousin. Behind the shelving brow 
lay the gray pulse that would not be 
content just to exist but must be fed 
on the shapes of unknown things, 
on patterns never before seen. 

So Joe Miller stayed upon the 
bank, though his hand closed around 
the handle of the grail, ready to 
carry it with him if he had to flee. 

The monster floated closer. Joe 
began to think that it might not be 
alive. But if it were not, why the 
great head poised at its front as if 
to strike? Yet it did not look alive. 
It gave a feeling of deadness, Tliis 
did not mean much, of course. Joe 
had seen a wounded bear pretend 
death convincingly and then rise 
up and tear the arm off a fellow- 
hunter. 

Moreover, though he had seen the 
hunter die, he had also seen the 
hunter alive again, that day he 
awoke on the banks with others of 
his kind. And if he, and Joe, too, 
could come alive again, why 
couldn’t this petrified snakelike head 
lose its dead woodenness and seize 
him in its teeth? 

But he ignored his fears and, 



trembling, approached the monster. 
He was a Titan, older brother to 
man, fresh with the dawn and with 
the primate’s have-to-know-what’s- 
going-on. 

A pygmy, mangy as the others 
but wearing on his brow a glass 
circlet with a stained-red flaming 
sun, beckoned to Joe Miller. The 
others upon the wooden beast stood 
behind the man with the glass drclet 
and held spears and strange devices 
that Joe learned later were bows 
and arrows. Tliey did not seem 
frightened of the colossus, but that 
may have been because they were 
so tired from their seldom-ceasing 
rowing against the current that they 
did not care what happened. 

It took a long time for the pygmy 
chief to get Joe aboard the ship. 
They came ashore to charge their 
grails while Joe backed away from 
them. They ate, and Joe ate also, but 
at a distance. His fellows had run 
for the hills, having been also pan- 
icked by the ship. Presently seeing 
that the river-snake did not threaten 
Joe, they slowly approached it. The 
pygmies retreated to the ship. 

And now the chief took a strange 
object from his grail’ and held a 
glowing wire to its tip, and smoke 
came from it and from the pygmy’s 
mouth. Joe jumped at the first puff; 
his fellows scattered for the foot- 
hills again. Joe wondered if the nose- 
less pygmies could be the brood 
of the dragon. Perhaps her children 
took this larval form, but, like their 
mother, they could breathe out fire 
and smoke? 

“But I ain’t a dummy,” Joe said. 
“It didn’t take me long to figure 



28 



IF 




out that the thmoke came from the 
object, vhich in Englith ith a thigar. 
Their chief made it plain that if I’d 
get on the thyip, I could thmoke the 
thigar. Now, I mutht’ve been crathy 
to do tho, but I vanted to thmoke 
that thigar. Maybe I thought I’d 
impreth my tribe, I don’t know.” 

H e jumped on the ship, his weight 
causing it to tilt a little on the 
port. He swung his grail to show 
them that if they attacked him, he 
would bash their skulls in with it. 
They took the hint and did not come 
close. The chief gave Joe a cigar, 
and though Joe coughed a little and 
found the taste of tobacco strange, 
he liked it. Moreover, when he had 
drunk beer for the first time, he 
was entranced. 

So Joe decided to go on the river- 
snake’s back up the river with the 
pygmies. He was put to work on a 
mighty sweep, and he was called 
Tehuti. 

“Tehuti?” von Richthofen said. 
“The Greek form is Thoth,” Clem- 
ens said. “To the Egyptians, he 
looked something like the long- 
beaked ibis-god. I suppose he must 
also have reminded them of the 
baboon-god, Bast, but that tremen- 
dous nose outweighed that consider- 
ation. So, Thoth, or Tehuti, he be- 
came.” 

Days and nights flowed by like the 
river. Sometimes, Joe became tired 
and wished to be put ashore. By now, 
he could speak the pygmies’ lang- 
uage, though haltingly. The chief 
would agree to do as Joe wished 
since it was obvious that any denial 
might result in the slaughter of his 



entire crew. But he would speak 
sadly of Tehuti’s education ending 
there, just when he was doing so 
well. He had been a brute though 
with the face of the god of wisdom, 
and soon he would be a man. 

Brute? God? Man? 

What were they? 

The order was not quite right, 
the chief would say. TTie correct 
sequence, ever upward, was brute, 
man and god. Yet it was true you 
might see a god disguised as a 
beast, and man merged insensibly 
from animal into deity, balanced 
between the two, and now and then 
changed into one or the other. 

That was beyond the breadloaf- 
shaped brain of Tehuti. He would 
squat and scowl at the nearing bank. 
There would be no more cigars or 
beer. The people on the bank were 
his kind, but they were also not 
his tribe, and they might kill him. 
Moreover, he was beginning for the 
first time to experience intellectual 
stimulation, and that would cease 
once he was back among the titan- 
throps. 

So he would look at the chief and 
blink, grin and shake his head and 
tell him he was going to stay on 
the ship. He took his turn at the 
sweep and resumed his study of 
the most marvelous of all things: 
a tongue that knew philosophy. He 
became fluent in their speech and 
began to grasp the wonderful things 
the leader told him, although some- 
times it was as painful as grasping 
a handful of thorns. If this or that 
idea eluded him, he pursued it, 
caught it, swallowed it, perhaps 
vomited it up a score of times. Even- 



THE FELLED STAR 



29 




tually, he digested it and got some 
nourishment from it. 

The river flowed by. They rowed, 
always staying close to the shore, 
where the current was weakest. Days 
and nights, and now the sun did not 
climb so high in the heavens but was 
a little lower at its zenith than it 
had been the week before. And the 
air grew colder. 

S am said, “Joe and his party 
were getting close to the north 
pole. The inclination of this plan- 
et’s equator to the plane of the 
ecliptic is zero. As you know, there 
are no seasons; day and night are 
equal in length. But Joe was ap- 
proaching the point where he would 
see the sun always half below the 
horizon and half above. Or would 
have if it hadn’t been for the moun- 
tains.” 

“Yeth. It vath alvayth tvilight. I 
got cold, though not ath cold ath 
the men. They vere thyivering their 
atheth off.” 

“His big bulk radiates heat slow- 
er than our puny bodies,” Clemens 
said. 

“Pleathe, pleathe! Thyould I 
talk or jutht keep my big mouth 
thyut?” 

Lother and Sam grinned at him. 
He continued. The wind grew strong- 
er, and the air became misty. Joe 
began to get uneasy. He wanted to 
turn back, but by now he did not 
want to lose the respect of the lead- 
er. He would go every inch of the 
way towards their unknown goal 
with them. 

“You didn’t know where they 
were going?” Lothar said. 



“Not egthactly. They vanted to 
get to the headvaterth of the river. 
They thought Aaybe the godth lived 
there, and there the godth vould 
admit them into the true aftervorld. 
They thaid that thitii vorld vathn’t 
the true world. It vath a thtage on 
the vay to the true vorld. Vhat- 
ever that ith.” 

One day, Joe heard a rumble that 
sounded as faintly but yet as near 
as gas moving within his bowels. 
After a while, as the noise became 
hke thunder, he knew it was water 
falling from immense heights. 

The ship swung into a bay pro- 
tected by a finger of land. The 
grailstones no longer lined the riv- 
er. The men would have to catch 
fish and dry them. There was also 
a store of bamboo tips on the ship; 
these had been collected in the 
sunlit region for just such an event- 
uality. 

The leader and his men prayed, 
and the party began climbing the 
steep cliffs beside the first of a 
series of cataracts. Here the super- 
human strength of Tehuti-Joe Miller 
helped them in overcoming ob- 
stacles. Other times, his great weight 
was a hinderance and a danger. 

Upward they went, wet because of 
the everpresent spray. When they 
came to a cliff smooth as ice for 
a thousand feet up, they despaired. 
Reconnoitering, they found a rope 
dangling from the face of a cliff. 
It was formed of towels tied to- 
gether. Joe tested its strength and 
climbed up, hand over hand, his 
feet braced against the cliff, until 
he reached the top. There he turned 
to watch the others follow him. The 



30 



IF 




chief,, first after Joe, tired much 
easier, and halfway up to the top 
he could go no further. Joe pulled 
him and the extremely heavy weight 
of the rope to the top. He did the 
same for each man in the party. 

^^TTThere in hell did the rope 
VV come from?” von Richtho- 
fen said. 

“Someone had prepared the way 
for them,” Clemens said. “Given 
the primitive technology of this 
planet, no one could have found 
a way to get that rope up to the 
rock around which one end of the 
rope was tied. Maybe a balloon 
might have lifted a man up there. 
You could make a balloon of river- 
dragon-skin or human skins, you 
know. You could make hydrogen 
by passing steam over highly heated 
charcoal in the presence of a suitable 
catalyst. But in this world of scarce 
metal, where’s the catalyst. 

“Hydrogen could be made without 
a catalyst but at an enormous cost in 
fuel. But there was no evidence 
of the furnaces needed to make the 
hydrogen. Besides, why would the 
towels be left behind, when they’d 
be needed again? No, some un- 
known person, let’s call him The 
Mysterious Stranger, put that rope 
there for Joe and party. Or for who- 
ever might come along. Don’t ask me 
who he was or how he did it. Listen. 
There’s more.” 

The party, carrying the rope, 
walked for several miles in the mist- 
ridden twilight on a plateau. They 
came to another cliff where the 
river broadened out above them into 
a cataract. It was so wide, it seem- 



ed to Joe that there was enough 
water to float the moon of Earth 
upon it. He would not have been 
surprised to see that great silver- 
and-black orb appear on the brink 
of the cataract far above and hurtle 
down that thunder of waters and be 
smashed to pieces on the rocks in 
the maelstrom foot. 

The wind became stronger and 
louder; the mist, thicker. Drops of 
water condensed on the towels they 
had now fastened around them- 
selves from head to foot. The cliff 
before them was as mirror-smooth 
and perpendicular as the one just 
ascended. Its top was lost in the fog; 
it could be only fifty feet high or 
could be ten thousand. They search- 
ed along the foot, hoping for some 
kind of fissure. And they found 
one. It was like a small door at the 
juncture of plateau and cliff. It was 
so low, it forced them to get down 
on hands and knees and crawl. Joe’s 
shoulders rubbed against the sides 
of the rock. But the rock was 
smooth, as if the hole had been 
made by man and rubbed until all 
roughness was gone. 

The tunnel led at a slightly less 
than 45-degree angle upwards and 
through the mountain. There was 
no estimating its distance. When 
Joe came out at the other end, how- 
ever, his shoulders and hands and 
knees were rubbed raw and bleed- 
ing even with the protection of 
towels. 

“I don’t understand,” von Rich- 
thofen said. “It seems to me that 
the mountains were shaped there to 
prevent men from getting to the 
end of the river. Why was this tun-

nel bored through s<^d rock to give 
intruders passage? And why wasn’t 
a tunnel placed in the first cliff?” 

“A tunnel in the first cliff might 
have been visible to whatever sen- 
tinels or patrols there are in that 
area,” Clemens said. “But the sec- 
ond cliff was hidden in mist.” 

“That chain of white towels would 
be even more outstanding,” the Ger- 
man said. 

“Maybe it was placed there not 
too long before Joe got there,” 
Clemens said. 

Von Richthofen shivered. 

“For Heaven’ th thaketh, let me 
tell thith! After all, it ith my tale.” 
“And a big one, too,” Clemens 
said, looking at Joe’s huge but- 
tocks. 

“Thtickth and thtoneth may 
break my boneth,” Joe replied.

T he party pushed on over another 
tableland for about ten miles. 
They slept or tried to, ate, and be- 
gan climbing. Now, though the 
mountains were very steep and 
rough, they were scalable. Their 
chief enemy was lack of oxygen. 
They gasped for breath and had to 
halt often to rest. 

By now Joe’s feet were hurting 
him, and he was limping. He did not 
ask if he could rest. As long as the 
others walked, so would he. 

“Joe can’t stay on his feet as 
long as a human,” Clemens said. 
“All of his species suffer from flat 
feet. Their weight is just too much 
for a biped that size. I wouldn’t be 
surprised if his kind became ex- 



tinct on Earth because of broken 
arches.” 

“I know bne thpethimen of Homo 
Thapienth who’th going to suffer 
from a broken nothe if he don’t 
keep hith nothe out of my buthineth, 
vhich ith telling thith lhtor}%” Joe 
said. He showed his wlck^-look- 
ing canines. 

They climbed until the river, 
broad as it was, was only a thread 
below them. Much of the time 
they could not see even that thread 
because of the clouds. Snow and 
ice made climbing even more dan- 
gerous. Then they found a way 
downward to another plateau and 
gropped through the fog against a 
wind that howl^ and 'beat at them. 

They found themselves beside a 
tremendous hole in the mountains. 
Out of the hole rushed the river, 
and on every side except riverwards 
the mountain rose straight and 
smooth. The hole was the only 
way to go. Out of it blasted a roar 
so loud they could not hear each 
other, the voice of a god who spoke 
as loud as death. 

Joe Miller found a narrow ledge 
entering the cave high above the 
waters. Joe noticed that the lead- 
er had now dropped back behind 
him. After a while, the titan throp 
became aware that all of the pyg- 
mies ‘were looking to him as their 
guide and helper. When they shout- 
ed to make themselves heard above 
the bellow, they called him Tehuti. 
There was nothing unusual in that, 
but before this he had detected 
overtones of jesting in their use of 
the name. No more. Now he was 
truly their Tehuti.

IF 




Clemens interrupted agaip. “It 
was as if we called the village 
idiot Jehovah or something like that. 
When men have no need of gods, 
they mock them. But when afraid, 
they treat them with respect. Now, 
you might say, Toth was leading 
them into the opening into the Un- 
derworld. 

“Of course, Tm only indulging in 
mankind’s vice of trying to make 
a symbol out of coincidence. If 
you scratch any dog, you’ll scare 
out a flea.” 

Joe Miller was breathing heavily 
through his grotesque nose, and the 
vast chest rose and fell like a bel- 
lows. Clearly, the reliving of that 
experience had aroused the old terror 
in him. 

The ledge was not like the tun- 
nel in the mountain. It had not been 
prepared. It was rough, and there 
were gaps in it, and sometimes it 
ran so Mgh that Joe had to crawl 
to squeeze between the ledge and 
the roof of the cavern. The darkness 
blinded him as if his eyes had been 
plucked out. His sense of hear- 
ing did not help him; the bellow 
filled his ears. Only his touch was 
left to guide him, and he was so 
agitated that he sometimes wondered 
if that were betraying him. He would 
have quit except that if he did, the 
men behind him would not have 
been able to go on. 

“Ve th topped tvithe to eat and 
voneth to thleep,” Joe said. “Just 
vhen I vath beginning to think ve 
might crawl until ve ran out of 
food, I thaw a grayneth ahead. It 
vathn’t a light. Jutht a leththening 
of the darkneth.” 



r iey were out of the cave, in 
the open air, on the side of 
a mountain. Several thousand feet 
below them was a sea of clouds. 
The sun was hidden behind the 
mountains, but the sky above was 
not yet dark. The narrow ledge con- 
tinued, and they crawled on their 
bloodied hands and knees down- 
ward now, since the ledge had 
narrowed to nothing. 

Trembling, they clung to the tin- 
iest of fingerholes. A man slipped 
and fell and clutched another man. 
Screaming, both disappeared into 
the clouds. 

The air became warmer. 

“The river was giving up its heat,” 
Clemens said. “It not only originates 
at the north pole, it also empties 
there after picking up heat in its 
serpentine wanderings over the en- 
tire planet. The air at the north 
pole is cold but not nearly as cold 
as that on Earth.” 

The party came to another shelf 
on which they could stand, facing 
the mountain, and proceed sidewise, 
like crabs. The shelf curved around 
the mountain-side. Joe halted. The 
narrow valley had widened into a 
great plain. He could hear, far be- 
low, the dash of surf against rock. 

Through the twilight, Joe could 
see the mountains ringing the sea of 
the north pole. The cloud-covered 
waters formed a body about sixty 
miles in diameter. The clouds were 
thicker at the opposite end of the 
sea. He didn‘t know why then, but 
Sam had explained that the clouds 
hid the mouth of the river, where 
the warm waters came into con- 
tact with the cold air. 



THE FELLED STAR 



33 




Joe tcK>k a few more steps around 
tihe curve of the ledge. 

And he saw the gray metal cy- 
linder sitting on the path before 
him. 

For a moment, he did not under- 
stand what it was, it looked so 
alien. It was so unexpected. Then it 
flowed into familiar lines, and he 
knew it was a grail left by a man 
who had come before him on this 
dangerous path. Some unknown 
pilgrim had survived the same perils 
as he. Up to that point, that is. 
He had put the grail down to eat. 
The lid was open, and there was 
the stinking remnant of fish and 
moldy bread within it. The pil- 
grim had used the grail as a pack, 
perhaps hoping he might come 
across a grailstone and recharge it. 

Something had happened to him. 
He would not have left the grail 
there unless he had been killed or 
had been so frightened he had run 
away without it. 

At this thought, Joe’s skin chilled. 

He went around the outcropping 
that was sitting at a point where the 
ledge went around a shoulder of 
granite. For a moment, his view of 
the sea was blocked. 

He went around the outcripping 
— and he cried out. 

T he men called and asked what 
troubled him. 

He could not tell them because 
the shook had taken away his new- 
ly learned speech, and he spoke in 
his native tongue. 

The clouds in the middle of the 
sea had roiled away for a few 
seconds. The top of a structure pro- 



jected from the clouds. It was cylin- 
drical and gray, like the top of a 
monster 'grail. 

Mists rose and fell around it, now 
revealing, now veiling. 

Somewhere in the mountains ring- 
ing the polar sea, a break existed. 
At that moment, the low sun must 
have passed this notch in the range. 
A ray of light fell through the notch 
and struck the top of the tower. 

Joe squinted his eyes and tried 
to see into the brightness of the 
reflection. 

Something round had appeared 
just above the top of the tower 
and was settling down towards it. 
It was egg-shaped and white, and it 
was from this that the sun was 
sparkling. 

The next instant, as the sun pass- 
ed by the notch, the sparkle died. 
The tower and the object above it 
faded into darkness and mist. Joe, 
crying out at the sight of the flying 
object, stepped back. His leg stnick 
the grail left by the unknown pil- 
grim. 

He swung his arms to regain his 
balance, but not even his apelike 
agility could save him. He toppled 
backward, bellowing horror as he 
turned over and over. Once he 
glimpsed the faces of his compan- 
ions, a row of dark brown ob- 
jects with the darker O’s of mouths, 
watching his descent to the clouds 
and waters beneath. 

“I don’t remember hitting the 
vater,” Joe said. “I avoke tranth- 
lated about tventy mileth from where 
Tham Clcmenth vath. Thith vath a 
plathe vhere Northmen of the 
tenth thentury A.D. lived. I had to

thaait learning a new language all 
over again. The little nothelethth 
people vere thcared of me, but they 
vanted me to fight for them. Then I 
met Tham, and ve became bud- 
dieth.” 

They were silent for a while. Joe 
lifted his glass to his thin and 
chimpanzee-flexible lips and poured 
out the rest of the liquor. Somber, 
the other two watched him. The 
only sign of brightness about them 
was the glow of their cigar ends. 

Von Richthofen said, “This man 
who wore a glass circlet with a 
sunburst. What did you say his 
name was?” 

“I didn’t.” 

“Well, then, what was it?” 

“Ikhnaton. Tham knowth more 
about him than I do, and I lived 
for four yeath with him. At leatht, 
that’th vhat Tham tha>^. But — ” 
here Joe looked smug — “I know 
the man and all Tham knowth ith 
a few hithtorical factth, tho-called.” 

VII 

V on Richthofen said good night 
and went belowdecks. Sam pac- 
ed back and forth, stopping once 
to light a cigarette for the helms- 
man. He wanted to sleep but could 
not. Insomnia had been skewering 
him for years; it drove through the 
middle of his brain, which spun on 
it like a wild gear, disengaged from 
his body’s need for rest. 

Joe Miller sat hunched against 
the railing and waited for his friend 
— thq only man he trusted and 
loved — to go belowdecks. Presently 
his head drooped, the bludgeon-nose 



describing a weary arc, and he 
snored. The noise was like that of 
trees being felled in the distance. 
Sequoias split, screeched, cracked. 
Vast sighings and bubblings alter- 
nated with the woodchoopers’ acti- 
vities. 

“Thieep veil, little chum,” Sam 
said, knowing that Joe dreamed of 
that forever-lost Earth where mam- 
moths and giant bears and Hons 
roamed and where beautiful — to 
him — females of his own species 
lusted after him. Once he groaned 
and then whimpered, and Sam knew 
that he was dreaming again of being 
seized by a bear which was obomp- 
ing on his feet. Joe’s feet hurt day 
and night. Like all of his kind, he 
was too huge and heavy for biped- 
al locomotion. Indeed, it was 
this that originated Sam’s theory 
for the extinction of the titanthrop'^ 
on Earth. Nature had experimented 
with a truly giant subhuman species 
and then she had dismissed them as 
failures. 

^^The rise and Fall of the Flat- 
feet'^ Sam said. “An article I shall 
never write.” 

Sam gave a groan, a weak echo 
of Joe’s. He saw Livy’s half- 
smashed body, given him briefly by 
the waves, then taken away. Or 
had she really been Livy? Had he 
not seen her at least a dozen times 
before while staring through the 
telescope at the multitudes on the 
banks? Yet, when he had been able 
to talk Bloodaxe into putting ashore 
just to see if the face was Livy’s, 
he had always been disappointed. 
Now there was no reason to believe 
the corpse had been his wife’s. 



THE FELLED STAR 



35 




He groaned again. How cruel 
if it had been Livy! How like Ufe! 
To have been so close and then to 
have her taken away a few minutes 
before he would have been reunited 
with her. And to have her cast 
upon the decks as if God — or 
whatever sneering forces ran the 
universe — were to laugh and to 
say, “See how close you came! 
Suffer, you miserable conglomera- 
tion of atoms! Be in pain, wretch! 
You must pay with tears and ag- 
ony!” 

“Pay for what?” Sam muttered, 
biting on his cigar. “Pay for what 
crimes? Haven’t I suffered enough 
on Earth, suffered for what I did 
do and even more for what I didn’t 
do?” 

Death had come on Earth, and he 
had been glad because it meant the 
end forever to all sorrow. He would 
no longer have to weep because of 
the sickness and deaths of his be- 
loved wife and daughters nor gloom 
because he felt responsible for the 
death of his only son, the death 
caused by his negligence. Or was 
it carelessness that had made his 
son catch the disease that killed him? 
Hadn’t he unconsciously permitted 
the robe to slip from his son, Ht- 
tle Langdon, while taking him for a 
carriage ride that cold winter day?” 

“No!” Sam said so loudly that 
Joe stirred and the helmsman 
growled something in Norse. 

He smacked his fist against his 
open palm, and Joe muttered again. 

“God, why do I have to ache 
with guilt for anything I’ve done?” 
Sam cried. “It doesn’t matter now! 
It’s all been wiped out; we’ve started 
with clean souls.” 



B ut it did matter. It made no dif- 
ference that all the dead were 
once mor^ alive and the sick were 
healthy and the bad deeds so re- 
mote in time and space that they 
should be forgiven and forgotten. 
WJiat a man had been and had 
thought on Earth, he still was and 
thought here. 

Suddenly, he wished he had a stick 
of dreamgum. That might remove 
the clenching remorse and make him 
wildly happy. 

But then it might intensify the an- 
guish. You never knew if a horror so 
terrifying would come that you want- 
ed to die. The last time he had taken 
the gum, he had been so menaced 
by monsters that he had not dared 
try the gum again. But maybe this 
time . no! 

Little Langdon! He would never 
see him again, never! His son had 
been only twenty-eight months old 
when he had died, and this meant 
that he had not been resurrected on 
the rivervalley. No children who 
had died on Earth before the age of 
five had been raised again. At least, 
not here. It was to be presumed 
that they were alive somewhere, 
probably on another planet. But for 
some reason, whoever was respon- 
sible for this had chosen not to 
place the infant dead here. And so 
Sam would never find him and so 
make amends. 

Nor would he ever find Livy or 
his daughters, Sarah, Jean, and 
Clara. Not on a river said to be 
possibly twenty million miles long 
with possibly thirty-seven billion 
people on its banks. Even if a man 
started at one end and walked up 



36 



IF 




one bank and looked at every per- 
son on that side and then, on reach- 
ing the end, walked back down the 
other side and did not miss a per- 
son, he would take — how long? A 
mile a day would mean a round trip 
of, say 365 into 40,000,000, what 
was that? He wasn’t any good at 
doing sums in his head, but it must 
be over 109,000 years. 

And even if a man could do this, 
could walk all those weary miles 
and make sure he never missed a 
face, at the end of over 100,000 
years he still might not find the 
face. The longed-for person might 
have died somewhere ahead of the 
searcher and been translated back 
down the river, behind the searcher. 
Or the searchee may have passed 
by the seacher during the night, 
perhaps while the searchee was look- 
ing for the searcher. 

Yet there might be another way 
to do this. The beings responsible 
for this rivervalley and the resur- 
rection might have the power to lo- 
cate anybody they wished to. They 
must have a central file or some 
means of ascertaining the identity 
and location of the valley-dwellers. 

Or, if they did not, they could 
at least be made to pay for what 
they had done. 

J oe Miller’s story was no fantasy. 

It had some very puzzling as- 
pects, but these hinted at something 
comforting. That was, that some 
nameless person — or being — 
wanted the valley dwellers to know 
about the tower in the mists of the 
north polar sea. Why? Sam did not 
know, could not guess. But that 



hole had been bored through the 
cliff to enable human beings to find 
out about the tower. And in that 
tower must be the light to scatter 
the darkness of ignorance. Of that 
Sam was sure. And then there was 
the widespread story of the English- 
man, Burton or Perkin, probably 
Burton, who had awakened pre- 
maturely in the pre-resurrection 
phase. Was the awakening any more 
of an accident than the hole bored 
through the polar cliff? 

And so Samuel Clemens had had 
his first dream, had nourished it un- 
til it had become The Great Dream. 
To make it real, he needed iron, 
much iron. It was this that had 
caused him to talk Erik Bloodaxe in- 
to launching the expedition in search 
of the source of the steel axe. Sam 
had not really expected that there 
would be enough of the metal to 
build the giant boat, but at least 
the Norse were taking him up-river, 
closer to the polar sea. 

Now, with a luck that he did not 
deserve — he really felt he de- 
served nothing good — he was with- 
in reach of more iron than he 
could possibly have hoped for. Not 
that that had kept him from hoping. 

He needed men with knowledge. 
Engineers who would know how to 
treat the meteorite iron, get it out, 
melt it down, reshape it. And engi- 
neers and technicians for the 
hundred other things needed. These 
Norsemen were no good for that. 

He toed Joe Miller’s ribs and said, 
“Get up, Joe. It’ll be raining soon.” 

The titanthrop grunted and rose 
like a tower out of a fog and stretch- 
ed. Starlight glinted on his canines. 

IW 



38 




He followed Sam across tlie deck, 
the bamboo planks creaking under 
the eight hundred pounds. From be- 
low, somebody cursed in Norse. 

The mountains on both sides were 
covered with clouds now, and the 
darkness was spreading over the val- 
ley and shutting off the insane glitter 
of twenty thousand giants stars and 
glowing gas sheets. Soon it would 
rain hard for half an hour, and 
then the clouds would disappear. 

Lightning streaked on the eastern 
bank; thunder bellowed. Sam 
stopped. Lightning always made him 
afraid, or, rather, the child in him 
afraid. Lightning streaked through 
him and showed him the haunted 
and haunting faces of those he had 
injured or insulted or dishonored 
and behind them were blurred faces 
reproaching him for nameless 
crimes. Lightning twisted through 
him; then he believed in an aveng- 
ing God out to bum him alive, to 
drown him in searing pain. Some- 
where in the clouds was the Wrath- 
ful Retributor, and He was looking 
for Sam Clemens. 

Joe said, “There’th thunder thome- 
vhere further down the river. 
No! It ain’t thunder! Lithen! Can’t 
you hear it! It’th thomething funny, 
like thunder but different.” 

Sam listened while his skin prick- 
led with cold. There was a very faint 
rumble downriver. He got even cold- 
er as he heard a louder rumble from 
upriver. “What the hell is it?” 

“Don’t get thcared, Tham,” Joe 
said. “I’m vith you.” But he was 
shivering, too. 

Lightning spread a filamented 
whiteness on the east bank. 



Sam jumped and said, “Jesus! I 
saw something flicker!” 

Joe moved next to him and said, 
“I thaw it! It’th the thyip! You 
know, the vun I thaw above the 
tower. But it’th gone!” 

Joe and Sam stood silent, peering 
into the darkness. Lightning explod- 
ed again, and this time there was no 
white eggshape high above the river. 

“It flickered out of nothing and 
went back to nothing. Like a mir- 
age,” Sam said. “If you hadn’t seen 
it, too, I’d have thought it was an 
illusion.” 

S am awoke on the deck. He was 
stiff, cold and confused. He 
rolled over and squinted his eyes at 
the sun just clearing the eastern 
range. 

Joe was on his back beside him, 
and the helmsman was sleeping be- 
side the wheel. 

But it was not this that brought 
him exclaiming to his feet. The gold 
of the sun had faded out as he 
brought his gaze down; green was 
everywhere. The muddied plains and 
mountains, with straws and stubs of 
debris, were gone. There was short 
grass on the plains, tall grass and 
bamboo on the hills, and the giant 
pine, oak, yew and irontree every- 
where on the hills. 

“Business as usual,” Sam mutter- 
ed. He was doubly shocked. Some- 
thing had put all aboard the 
Dreyrugr asleep, and while they were 
unconscious, the incredible work of 
clearing off the mud and replanting 
the vegetation had been completed. 
The world was reborn!

IF * Short Story 

PELANDRA’S HUSBANDS 

by E. A. WALTON 

Pelandra was only a junior 
member of the immortals — 
but she gave the others life! 



P roject New Earth (had seemed 
so simple to Pelandra, fifteen 
years ago when she had trooped on 
to the spaceship with her six hus- 
bands and the three old scientists. 
Of course, nobody would ever have 
known that Zor, Lunor and Gohar 
were old, because each man had 
the deceptive appearance of a twen- 
ty-five-year-old athlete land the vi- 
tality to match it. These three were 
members of an ultra-exclusive elite, 
a secret society known as the Chosen 
Brethren, and they had been selected 
to rule the distant planet for which 
the great nuclear craft was now 
bound. They would form the central 
intelligence cell destined to control 
the test-tube people by computers 
and brain electrodes. 

This way, a predetermined history 
of the new planet had been possible. 
The programming of the self- 
regenerating computers had taken 
two hundred years to reach perfec- 
tion. Pelandra herself was only a 
very junior member of the Brethren 
and she had not as yet completely 
earned the right to immortality. At 
one time, the project had seemed 
very exciting and stimulating, but 
now the woman found it futile . 



because Husband Three was mortal. 

Until recently, she had been 
thrilled by the keen interest Lunor 
showed in her progress. He opened 
his thoughts to her freely. Only this 
day, he had said to her: “We old 
men have reached a state of almost 
certain immortality. You will too, 
in time. But, my child, you must be 
single-minded about it. I think I 
detect in you a definite bias towards 
Three. Try to overcome this fault, 
please. Centuries ago, when I was 
lucky enough to discover the Life 
Fluid which enabled me to live an 
active span of a century and a half, 
I dreamed of this journey and of 
taking such a person as you with 
me.” His great eyes glowed with 
pride. “You are to become my own 
wife when we reach the new planet, 
but for this great honor, you must 
be perfect. Therefore, I must insist 
that you do not allow unseemly, 
primitive emotions to cloud your 
outlook. Do you understand?” 

The woman shivered slightly and 
replied. “I will try, Lunor, but it is 
very hard for me. My imagination is 
still not completely under my own 
control, even though I practice 
daily. I confess that the young man 



40 




is unusually attractive. It would be 
foolish to try to deny this. However, 
you can rest assured that my loyalty 
is to you, alone.” Pelandra spoke 
these honeyed words with convic- 
tion, but she lied. The woman was 
terrified that Lunor would realize 
this fact. Also, she had a faint sus- 
picion that Gohar had guessed her 
guilty secret. She loved Three! 

Pelandra’s own knowledge, 
Zor was at least two hundred, 
and the others much older. Lunor 
was a great power within the Galaxy 
Organization, because of his mass of 
accumulated knowledge and be- 
cause he tried to manipulate his sub- 
ject peoples as humanely as possible 
— so long as scientific progress was 
not endangered, of course. 

As for Gohar, Pelandra hated 
him. To her, he seemed to have the 
coldness of a reptile. All desire, ex- 
cept the desire to remain alive and 
manipulate others, had died in him 
long ago. 

Pelandra smiled to herself when 
she saw that Husband Number 
Three had taken up her complex 
navigational instruments and was 
trying studiously to check the bear- 
ings of the spacecraft, hurtling along 
at the speed of light. He was having 
his usual difficulty. A radio tele- 
scope on Earth had already moni- 
tor^ their direction and distance, 
and an Earth computer had de- 
cided that no corrections needed to 
be made. Her latest Husband, who 
was unusually clever for a replace- 
ment human, had picked up this 
information on the nuclear radio 
communicator and now, eagerly. 



wished to check his own growing 
navigational skill against the com- 
puter. 

Making very sure that no one was 
spying on her, the woman came over 
to him and laid an affectionate arm 
about his broad shoulders. 

“Don’t you remember what I told 
you about the three co-ordinates?” 
she asked indulgently. “Now, tell 
me, how far are we away from 
Earth?” ' 

“Fifteen light-years,” he replied, 
his face boyish with embarrassed 
desire to learn and to please her. 
Because of him, Pelandra was ready 
to jeopardize her chance of immor- 
tality. But now that Lunor had 
grown suspicious it was necessary 
to exercise extreme caution. He 
would cast them both into space if 
he knew. Besides, Gohar always 
seemed to be nearby, his wicked 
eyes eager to detect any anti-elite 
behavior on her part. 

“Well, you can either use that 
information or, better still, measure 
the diameter of the solar disk and 
use the plane of the planetary sys- 
tem for the other two.” She kissed 
him playfully on the dheek. “It’s 
quite simple, really, silly boy. I don’t 
know why you always make such a 
fuss about it. But, as I told you be- 
fore, you’ll nearly always be wrong; 
that’s why we have to rely on peri- 
odic Earth checks.” 

Pelandra liked to keep close to 
her husband. She had a secret and 
dreadful fear that she, too, might 
one day be cold and hateful like 
Gohar. Three seemed to rejuvenate 
her humanity, as if some inexplic- 
able life force was moving within

him. It came into her mind that per- 
haps those who died for the cause 
of science were luckier than those 
who had to live for it! 

Throwing reason aside, she began 
to confide in Three. It was the one, 
unforgivable sin! 

“Did you know that I was Lunor’s 
chief assistant in the Halls of the 
Chosen Brethren?” she asked. Then, 
seeing his puzzled look, she con- 
tinued, “How foolish of me. How 
could you possibly know? How 
could you know that there are twen- 
ty Select Beings destined to live for- 
ever and that four of them are on 
this ship!” 

“Are you one of them?” cried 
the startled Three, staring at her 
with troubled eyes. 

“Yes, I’m afraid I am. Listen care- 
fully. I love you and because of this 
I do not wish to deceive you. Will 
you try to understand and forgive 
me?” 

“Yes.” His honest eyes were full 
of compassion. 

“I have acted as a surgeon to 
replace their failing organs with 
spare parts from live humans. Ah, 
don’t shrink from me like that! They 
were specially bred by a very hu- 
mane process in the delightful cities 
of the suburbs.” 

Three stood in rigid silence; he 
had been from a suburb! 

“Every human conceived is cross- 
matched and classed genetically at 
the test-tube stage? Those not suit- 
able for replacement purposes are 
trained as sdentists, doctors, space- 
men or agricultural workers, accoird- 
ing to their potential mental ability 
— which is ascertained when the 



embryo is removed from the womb 
and placed in a test incubator for 
investigation* and advanced culture.” 
Pelandra was speaking in a flat 
monotone and avoiding Three’s eyes. 

“But I have never worked!” cried 
the young man, gripping her by the 
shoulders. “I was only taught to 
keep my body fit and to fill my mind 
with artistic thought. Does this mean 
. does it mean that I am a re- 
placement human? Oh, no, it is too 
horrible!” He slid to his knees be- 
fore her, burying his face against 
her, shivering with horror. 

Pelandra’s whole being was filled 
with pain as she wrapped her arms 
about him, crying over him and 
stroking his hair, while he gazed 
hopelessly into her lovely face with 
the terror slowly mounting in his 
expression. 

“You must realize,” she said sad- 
ly, “that Lunor has experimented a 
hundred years to make this present 
journey possible. The great man him- 
self carefully nurtured my own em- 
bryo through incubation. He has 
trained my mind personally for 
twenty years. I am the most intelli- 
gent and physically perfect specimen 
in the whole galaxy. I excel even 
Lunor. I have three functions on this 
journey: space pilot, surgeon and 
mother. I am sorry. Three, but I 
wanted you to understand.” Wearily 
she put a hand to her throbbing 
forehead. “Try not to hate me.” 

“I can only love you, Pelandra,” 
he replied simply. “When am I to 
die?” 

“Tomorrow!” 

“Then let us be happy together 
in the time we have left, my love.”

IF 




And so they clung together in 
what can only be described as a 
beautiful sadness. 

Xt was not really six husbands that 
XPelandra had brought with her 
onto the spaceship. Actually, it had 
only been five because Husband 
Number Six was still in a test tube 
in the pocket of her galaxy suit at 
the time of launching. He had not 
been due to be bom for another five 
years. Now he was a strapping fair- 
haired lad of ten. Pelandra thought 
what a shame it was that he would, 
like all her other husbands, have to 
die before the landing on the new 
planet. She ran a weary hand across 
her forehead, as if to bmsh this dis- 
tasteful thought away. 

The huge spacecrMt was coasting 
along without engines. On Lunor’s 
orders, they did this as often as 
possible in order to save fuel. 
Through the forward vision window, 
they could see a moving vista of 
distant meteorites. Pelandra had de- 
cided that, as they were on the cor- 
rect flight path, there was no need 
to release any gas jets to reorient the 
craft as they had done on previous 
occasions. 

So Pelandra, who had no more 
work to do, was content to sit with 
Three and talk to him. She felt like 
weeping. It was strange and bewild- 
ering to her that the thought of 
parting from her third husband 
should cause her so much heart- 
ache. After all, she had disposed of 
the first two with complete medical 
calm and perfect scientific indiffer- 
ence. What in the name of the Stars 
was the matter with her? 



Pelandra plunged deep into her 
own mind, seeking an explanation 
without success. 

“What a shame you cross-match 
so well with the three old men,” she 
sighed. “You would have made an 
excellent scientist. Your inteUigenco 
is easily fifty per cent of my own, 
whereas my other two husbands 
hardly made up one per cent be- 
tween them. Poor devils! Oh, Three, 
why am I so sad about you? Is it, 
do you think, because you taught 
me how to laugji?” 

At that moment Gohar came 
smirking up to them. He looked at 
Pelandra with his cold fish eyes, 
mocking her. Then he turned upon 
Three and dismissed him curtly with 
a nod. 

Number Jliree knew his place; 
Pelandra’s special treatment had not 
made him indiscreet. He bowed low 
before Gohar and made a great show 
of removing his humble person from 
the mighty one’s presence. But he 
winked at Pelandra as he did so, 
making her want to laugh, despite 
the sadness of it all. 

Pelandra’s heart twisted for the 
youth. Tomorrow she must surely 
kill him! Her hands trembled with 
an unusual weakness. 

“Your presence is requested in 
the meeting hall,” sneer^ Gohar. 
“It may be a matter of life or death 
for you, my dear Pelandra.” He 
sniggered after his revolting fashion. 

Pelandra ignored him, but she 
switched over to the automatic con- 
trol system. She realized that Gohar 
had been sneaking again. How much 
had he overheard? She found she 
was too unhappy to care.

L imor was waiting for her, calm 
and dignified in his robes of 
office. He had an impressive air of 
command. His gray, eagle-bright 
eyes bored into her with the inten- 
sity of his visionary insight. He was 
without a doubt, a king among men. 
He seemed very grave. 

“I am most disturbed by a re- 
port that you disobeyed my orders 
and told Three he is to die. You 
must be aware of the punishment 
for such a crime. Have you gone 
mad? Have you forgotten that you 
swore a sacred oath of secrecy?” 
Lunor thundered at the cringing 
woman. 

“Try to overlook my weakness, 
my loM,” cried Pelandra. “I am not 
disloyal, I do not wish to betray 
your trust. It was just that I wanted 
the boy to know that he would 
never see me again after tomorrow. 
Am I not allowed even one fault?” 
Lunor studied her thoughtfully. 
“I believe you,” he said. “After all, 
you are a mere babe immortality- 
wise, so some allowance must be 
made. I suppose. But please clearly 
understand that this is your last 
chance, Pelandra.” 

“I understand,” whispered the de- 
jected girl, trembling more violently 
than ever. 

“Well?” asked Lunor, his noble 
face troubled still, for he sensed 
Pelandra’s reluctance for her task. 
“Don’t tell me that I was mistaken 
in my choice. You still do not wish 
to operate tomorrow!” 

“Of course I will operate. Mighty 
One,” insisted Pelan(h*a. “I cannot 
let a hundred years of research be 
wasted merely because I have fallen 



in love with a replacement human, 
can I?” She made her reply scorn- 
fully, deeply shocked that Lunor 
should thus doubt her integrity. 

But perhaps the old man was 
wiser than she knew. 

Pelandra walked wearily to the 
portal, her beautiful features strained 
by grief. Her large blue eyes dimmed 
by pain and longing. All the vitality 
seemed to have drained from her 
long, supple limbs. 

The woman looked, with some- 
thing akin to hatred, at the man 
who had made her perfect, who had 
condemned her to live forever. Pel- 
andra had already received the Life 
Fluid which would insure that she 
lived to be at least a hundred and 
fifty, after which time, the spare 
part routine would become operable. 

“Come, we must make our prepar- 
ations,” she said in listless tones. 
They collected Zor and Gohar, then 
went on to the operating theater. 

“Lunor’s plan is brilliant in its 
simplicity,” remarked Zor good- 
naturedly. “A thirty-five year jour- 
ney. Six husbands for Pelandra; the 
eldest being aged twenty at the 
time of launching; the second, fif- 
teen; the third, ten; the fourth, five; 
the fifth a babe in arms and the 
sixth in a test tube to incubate for 
five years. What a great and wonder- 
ful plan!” 

“Yes,” Gohar agreed. “In this 
way, one husband reaches maturity 
every five years and is available for 
replacement purposes and his re- 
mains for committal to space and 
oblivion. Pelandra marries each one 
of them when he reaches the age of 
twenty and operates on him five 



44 



IF 




years later, after each has given her 
five children; which Liinor, of 
course, rears in test tubes.” 

“And these children will provide 
the first work team on New Earth,” 
cried Zor. 

That night Three suddenly began 
to cry because he could not bear the 
thought of parting from Pelandra. 
She stroked his brown, curly hair 
and told him that he would feel no 
pain; and he was comforted because 
he trusted her and loved her. 

Next morning, Pelandra examined 
the three young-old men, to ascer- 
tain which organs needwl replace- 
ment. She had already committed 
Husband Number Three to the deep- 
freeze machine, and her heart was 
heavy with grief. 

Presently Lunor, Zor and Gohar 
also lay in their own deep-freeze 
units, like three rather beautiful 
marble effigies. Waiting for her to 
use her sharp instruments and laser 
beams on dear, beloved Number 
Three! Pelandra looked with pity at 
Lunor, who for the last ten years 
had breathed with Number One’s 
lungs. She looked with loathing at 
Gohar, who had one brown eye of 
his own and one blue that had be- 
longed to Number Two. Number 
Two had also provided Zor with a 
new right leg, and Number One had 
given him a spleen. 

Pelandra looked thoughtfully at 
the three old men, lying so peace- 
fully in refrigeration, and suddenly 
she smiled. 

T he women turned a dial, and the 
solar cells beneath the three 
units suddenly glowed like great red 



suns. The temperature gauges went 
up beyond infinity, and the reading 
hands broke off because of the in- 
tensity of the shock they had suf- 
fered. 

“It will take eternity to unfreeze 
the three wise men,” Pelandra ob- 
served to herself, giving one of her 
rare laughs. 

Then she slowly went over to the 
unit which contained Number Three 
in all his youthful glory. Gently, 
with great skill and patience, she 
moved with expert fingers about the 
dials and switches. It took her three 
days and three nights to bring him 
back to glowing, throbbing life. 

She herself would teach him all 
the wise men knew except how to 
live forever! And she would teach 
her children how to attend to the 
embryos and safeguard the con- 
densed atmosphere capsule. They 
would all lead busy, useful lives, but 
with free minds, not as human ro- 
bots! 

Oh, it would be such a happy 
landing now. 

And it was. 

Pelandra’s first action on reaching 
the new planet was to send a mes- 
sage back to Earth telling of her 
dreadful crime against science. This 
message would take thirty-five years 
to reach its destination, and another 
thirty-five years would be needed 
for the Galaxy Punishment Force to 
reach the new planet to retaliate. 
Pelandra had not a care in the uni- 
verse, because both she and Husband 
Number Three would both be safely 
dead, long before the avenging Earth 
Forces could make good their at- 
tack. END

IMPLOSION 

by ANDREW J. OFFUTT 



Old people were dying. Nothing new 
about that — but they all died at the 
same age, and it was getting younger! 



I 

X T<^K)dy mentioned it for a while. 

Not on a large scale, I mean. 
A couple of years actually passed 
before it was noticed as a definite 
trend. I’d heard other doctors com- 
ment, of course. Merely that they 
seemed to be losing a lot of old 
patients all of a sudden, for no par- 
ticular reason. But physicians are 
so used to death we didn’t get ex- 



cited. It was a hard-working insur- 
ance actuary who saw it for what 
it was. 

People were just . dying. 
Old people. Doctors and coroners 
wouldn’t admit to perplexity. 

They would put down “heart 
attack” or “stroke” or “heart fail- 
ure” or “cardiac arrest’*, or the like. 
Mostly cardiac arrest. Good old 
catchall. Think about it. Means the 



46 




patient’s heart stopped beating. Well, 
I should smile, it did! Did you ever 
hear of anyone’s being dead and his 
heart still beating? That’s an effect, 
not a cause. When you’re dead your 
heart stops pumping. But something 
causes that, 

A bullet. A fall. An illness; can- 
cer, or cerebral hemorrhage. Or a 
plague. That is, a Plague. 

The insurance actuary pointed out 
that the death rate was up — way 
up — among old people. Everything 
else was still there, of course; men 
murdering each other with automo- 
biles and slipping in the bathtub 
and so on. But old people were dy- 
ing. The oldest. 

Well, there wasn’t anything unus- 
ual about that, and I remember even 
I chuckled. Sure, we knew old age 
was a disease. We called its cause 
a virus, which meant we didn’t know 
what it was. A filterable virus . 
which means the organism was not 
filterable. We hadn’t found it. And 
since we hadn’t found the cause, 
we certainly hadn’t done much about 
the effect. We had lengthened the 
lifespan. We could keep a man alive, 
and we were proud of it. Oh, may- 
be he was a vegetable, but hurray 
and so what, we were keeping him 
alive. The family usually found the 
money, somehow. 

But the actuary was one hundred 
per cent on the beam. The death 
rate was up among the oldest people, 
and it was increasing. Today thirty, 
tomorrow thirty-one, this day next 
month forty, this day next year 
sixty-two. I’m using relative figures, 
you realize. No need to start spout- 
ing precise ones. Just consider that 



in City A, on May 1st of 1979, 
twenty people died. In 1985, tw^ty- 
six died on that same day. In 1992, 
thirty-three. All in accord with the 
population increase; no cause fqf 
alarm. You have ten people, one 
dies. You have a hundred, ten die, 
et cetera. 

But then it began curving up. 

T hat actuary was shaken. I’ll tell 
you. He shook the company 
president, too, and the board of 
directors. And there’s where I came 
in. I had just been made a director. 
You know how it goes: you don’t 
mind working, which puts you in 
a class by yourself. You make money 
and become pretty well known and 
make some more money, and all of 
a sudden you’re successful. People 
think you’re pretty smart. They want 
you to be a director of the United 
Fund and the school board and a 
bank and the country club and a 
hospital and Kiwanis and this and 
that. Doesn’t matter if you’re an 
executive in an aircraft company or 
a plumbing and heating contractor 
or a distiller or even an M.D. So I 
had a chunk of stock and a chunk of 
permanent life insurance and some- 
how wound up a director of the 
Great Coastal Life Insurance Com- 
pany of America. 

No, I didn’t attend the meetings. 
Lord, I knew about as much about 
the life insurance business as I do 
about quantum mechanics ... I 
can define “quantum” and I can 
come close to defining “mechanics” 
— I think. Anyhow this actuary’s 
report was mentioned in the min- 
utes I received in the mail and I 



POPULATION IMPLOSfbN

read it and chuckled. So he had dis- 
covered that old people were dying! 
Just tell me if they start dying of 
scarlet fever or botulism or chicken 
pox, I thought. Or puerperal fever. 

Well, then the article showed up 
in Newsweek five months later. A 
lot of people Still thought it didn’t 
make sense, but it was the second 
time I’d seen it, and there I was a 
professional and . well, I called 
Roger Calkin at Great Coastal and 
asked him to send that nutty young 
actuary of his over. 

And there it was. The actuary — 
Ike Hill — had by that time started 
collecting figures from all over the 
world. All you had to do was look 
aft them. All deaths were up, natur- 
ally. Way up. But ... the increases 
that reached up and slapped you in 
the eyeball and squeez^ the pit 
of your stomach was in the over-75 
group. It hadn’t struck anyone as 
particularly odd that the Russian 
Premier, the West German Chan- 
cellor and the Speaker all had died 
within a few months of each other. 
But they’d had plenty of company. 
Those three had all been past eighty, 
and their group was dying by the 
score, by the thousand, by the tens 
of thousands. We’d prolonged their 
lives for them; now they were cash- 
ing in one after the other, as if 
they were crowding each other to 
prove or disprove their particular 
faith’s belief or disbelief in after- 
life. As if they were tired of life, or 
as if they were trying to make us 
look bad. Sure, I had that thought. 

I remember saying, “Hell, Ike Hill, 
at this rate there won’t be anyone 
over 75 alive anywhere!” 



And I was right. It took less than a 
year. In the meanwhile the world 
lost seventy%or eighty assorted sen- 
ators, representatives, MP’s and 
what-have-you lawmakers. A king. 
And even ten presidents, premiers 
and the like, and one dictator. Sev- 
eral generals. A potful of judges. 
The Pope. Two-thirds of the Roman 
Curia. And every Cardinal Arch- 
bishop in the world but eleven. Oh, 
it was great for promotions, and 
pageants! 

People were taking notice by then, 
of course. Someone used the word 
“plague” in a newspaper story one 
day, and after that it was The Plague. 
A lot of people did a lot of theoriz- 
ing. Hiere was religious gabble and 
atheist gabble and medical gabble 
and political gabble-gabble. Over a 
dozen different men announced over 
a dozen different causes. One even 
announced a cure. 

They were all wrong. 

Then I found it, and I couldn’t 
think of anyone to call save Ike Hill. 

II 

W e got our heads and our fig- 
ures together. We barely had 
to glance at them. Of course they 
weren’t completely accurate. It’s im- 
p>ossible to learn exactly how many 
people in the world died or were 
born last year, or for that matter 
even twenty years ago'. The ladies 
of Africa and India and China don’t 
publish announcements every time 
they have a kid, whether they ex- 
pose it to die or not, and they don’t 
file death statistics, either. 

We took the figures over to Ike’s 



48 



IF 





POPUUTION IMPLOSION 



49 




office and turned on some lights 
and fed them into the Iron Brain, 
and it told us what we already knew, 
which IS about all Iron Brains are 
good for anyhow. 

The death rate matched the birth 
rate. 

In the United States it exceeded 
the birth rate. 

Every time somebody propped a 
kid on the tail and made him suck 
up that first highly addictive drag of 
air, someone, somewhere, gasped his 
last one. And whatever the cause, 
it didn’t know anything about fair 
play or national boundaries. The 
birthrate was highest in Asia. You 
know which country had the longest 
life expectancy, don’t you? The 
largest percentage of old people? 
Uh-huh. The U.S. of A. was rapidly 
running out of the euphemism I’ve 
always hated: “Senior Citizens.” (I 
don’t like any euphemism that indi- 
cates I’m junior). Even then an 
extraneous thought went creeping 
across my mind like a guilty cat: 
something or somebody — capitalize 
that if you want — was solving the 
Medicare problem. In a few years, 
maybe months, I wouldn’t be filling 
out so many of those government 
forms for aged patients any more. 
The AHA wouldn’t be hollering 
about all the paperwork involved in 
Medicare admissions. And my sons 
wouldn’t have the 2\% social securi- 
ty tax I was paying! 

Frankly Ike Hill and yours truly 
M.D. didn’t know what the hell to 
do. We just stared at each other and 
the machine and then went out and 
found a quiet, dark place to talk. 
I forgot to call my answering serv- 



ice for the first time in five years. 
First time I’d got drunk in fifteen 
years, since I was a freshman in 
pre-med. 

Whom do you tell? For maybe 
three years a plague had been raging 
across the world, a plague which 
obligingly passed over people who 
had lives to live and knocked on 
the doors of those who’d lived a 
fair-sized one already. Whom do you 
tell? No one else knew there was 
no one, not one single person, any- 
where in the world, older than 75 
— maybe 74 by then. No one knew 
that every time an OB checked in 
at Admittance some oldster checked 
out of the world. And ... if it 
went on . then by this time next 
year, there wouldn’t be anyone over 
73, or 72, depending upon the in- 
ternational birthrate and the num- 
ber of people in that age group. Or 
maybe 71, or 70. And the next year 
. whom do you tell? Call Washing- 
ton and say “Mister President, this 
is Thomas Jefferson McCabe, M.D., 
in Atlanta, and pretty soon our 
country is going to be out of busi- 
ness, populationwise, and by the 
way you’re 69, aren’t you? Have you ' 
arranged disposal of your papers?” 
Ike Hill and I didn’t know. So we 
drank too many gimlets and had 
to be poured into a couple of taxis 
and sent home to understanding 
wives. 

I n the morning I prescribed the 
usual ineffectual old wives’ tales 
for myself and held my head care- 
fully as I called A. T. Griffin, M.D., 
Chief at Good Samaritan Hospital. 
And I called Michael Rosen, M.D., 



50 



IP 




head of the U of G Med School and 
I managed to get them together in 
Doctor Griff’s office at Good Sam. 
And I took poor Ike Hill with me 
and I told them. We told them. Then 
we showed them. It meant a lot more 
to them than to us, I assure you . 
Doctor Griff was sixty-four and Doc- 
tor Mike admitted to sixty-seven. 
And they bought it. They had to. 
Oh, we thought, and we postulated, 
and we opined, and we theorized 
and hoped out loud. But we had the 
answer. 

Swell. What to do with it? I felt 
relieved — I’d shared it. I’d trans- 
ferred the weight and the responsi- 
bility of the knowledge onto the 
shoulders of the best two medical 
father-images I had. I was out of it! 

Well, I took my first plane ride 
to Washington. Doctor Mike’s doc- 
tor said he shouldn’t travel — you 
think we don’t have doctors? Physi- 
cian, heal thyself! — or try. And 
Doctor Griff just wouldn’t - couldn’t. 
So Mister Ike Hill B.S., M.S., and 
A. J. McCabe, M.D., flew up to 
the big town with introductions from 
thos^, two Big Men — Doctor Griff 
was 'also president of the Georgia 
Medical Association and a director 
of the AM A — and papers and 
graphs and reports and analyses and 
a few inches of computer tape. 

We got in amazingly fast. My 
medical friends had done a good 
job, working personally and through 
senators and what not. I think it 
was the President’s secretary got 
us in; he was a Georgian. It’s pretty 
hard for mere people to get an 
audience with the President of, by, 
and for the people. 



Sorry. Gettuig old, as things go 
now. I’ll be forty-five next month. 

Naturally we wound up with the 
Surgeon G^eral (first time he’d had 
anything to do in years!) and some 
fellow from Bethel aind a couple 
of hotrods from Johns H. and some- 
body else I later found out was a 
psychiatrist. Watching us! Ike and 
me! 

They had to buy it, too. It’s 
tough to buy truth you don’t like. 
But it’s tougher to turn your back 
on it, and not too smart, either, as 
Galileo, among others, proved. 

You can’t imagine how they 
looked. How we felt. What to do? 
There was the evidence. Now they 
were in the same leaky dinghy I’d 
been hand-paddling the past several 
days. What to do? — and how? I 
was relieved, I can tell you that. 
I’d unshouldered the burden. I had 
gently laid it at the feet of the boss, 
the proverbial Authorities, and now 
I was out from under. 

And that’s how Ike Hill and I 
got put in charge of Project Methu- 
saleh. That’s how I got to be one of 
the Jaycee’s Ten Most that year. I 
think it would have — and should 
have — been Ike, but there was a 
choice, and I was a member. 

F unny thing about the Government 
Mind. You tell them you know 
where there’s a problem, they right 
away treat you with respect — 
especially if you’re in "the American 
Magicians’ Association and have the 
initials after your name. The schools 
translate them Medical Doctor. I’ve 
always figured they stand for Me 
Dunno. But everybody else auto-

matically assumes Magic Disipenser. 

Back to that govermnent mind. 
It assumes that if you’ve been smart 
enough to point out a problem, ob- 
viously you’re the man to tackle it. 
Tell the Feds you’ve found some- 
thing wrong and they say fine, work 
on a cure, here’s some money (we 
have lots and lots) and some papers 
to order some more and a title and 
some blank progress reports for you 
to file in triplicate, triweekly. I did 
have enough sense at least to get a 
commitment from the President, and 
get it in writing, my way. 

Then . funny thing about the 
human mind (as opposed to the one 
just mentioned) . Somebody gives 
you a problem, and you right away 
do one of three things. Punch the 
nearest panic button. Fake it. Or 
find that your mind is hurtling off 
in ten directions to Get the Job 
Done. That’s what happened to me. 
Oh, obviously I had no solution. But 
I had thought of Step One, how to 
study the problem. 

We got ourselves ten volunteers. 
Controls, seven male and three fe- 
male human beings, aged 74. We put 
’em in a hospital, third floor of Good 
Sam, and cleared the rest of the 
floor. In reverse order; I was careful 
with those people. My Personal 
Responsibilities. Sure, there were a 
lot more women of that age, but 
the reason I wound up with seven 
men was the men we interviewed 
weren’t as toUchy about giving their 
birthdates. We recorded them. I felt 
a monster, grisly, ghoulish, as I put 
them down, one under the other, in 
order: earliest birthdate at the top. 

Then I did everything. Ran tests. 



X-rays, EKG’s. EEG’s. Taps. Smears 
Basal Metabolisms. Those ten peo- 
ple were delighted. Free room serv- 
ice, lots of attention and no cost. 
And furthermore they could enjoy 
it; they weren’t sick! I’d deliberately 
picked them in good health (as well 
as could be expected, considering, as 
we’re fond of saying). I supervised 
their diets as if they were the first 
septulets and I had a movie contract 
riding on them. Decuplets, I guess, 
under the circumstances — perish 
the thought. They lived in near-ster- 
ile conditions. Daily checks. Blood 
pressure. Sistolics. Reactions. Put- 
your-tongue-and-say-ah. All of it. 

T hey died. Very neatly, from the 
top of the list. And I felt ghou- 
lish and grisly, crossing off their 
names, one by one, from the top, 
with ugly satisfaction that they were 
proving me right. Cause of death: 
cardiac arrest. 

It was enough to give me back 
the religion I’d outgrown in med 
school when I first realized there’s 
no justice in nature. Really. I felt 
like putting down “God” after 
Cause of Death. I didn’t, nut I 
didn’t write cardiac arrest or natural 
causes or any of that rot, either. I 
put “PLAGUE,” in block let- 
ters. And plague it was. The Plague. 
The one we couldn’t cure, because it 
didn’t make anyone sick or have 
any symptoms whatever, and we 
haven’t found a cure for death yet. 

None of those old people had any 
symptoms. They just died, peacefully 
and quietly. Patient Rested Comfort- 
ably To THie End. We had permis- 
sion, and we autopsied to shame all

IF 




previous autopsies. We examined 
those cadavers more carefully than 
Leonardo had. Nothing. No bugs. 
No . well, just nothing. I’d have 
welcomed a little note: “I decided 
his time had come and there’s noth- 
ing you can do about it so go on 
back to prescribing the Pill and 
delivering the ones who don’t use 
it on Wednesday-afternoon golf. 
Your very truly, (signed) Prime 
Mover.” 

And about that time I had the 
insane thought. The answer. The 
only one. Crazy. 

The aforementioned Pill. 

ra 

T here are more things in heaven 
and earth, Horatio, then you and 
I will ever dope out, so let’s start 
by talking about something we do 
know. At the beginning of the 
Christian Era there were about 250,- 
000,000 people in the world. By the 
middle of the 17th Century there 
were a half-billion; it took some 
1650 years to double. By the 1800’s 
there were a billion. By 1960 the 
world’s population had doubled 
again, to two billion, and indications 
were that there would be six billion 
by AD 2,000. Momentum. Snowball 
effect. Like compound interest. 

People didn’t have enough sense 
to stop breeding in the face of over- 
population. It wasn’t personal 
enough. So who’s Julian Huxley? 
Yes, well, how about if it’s good 
and personal? Or bad and personal. 

Look: every time a baby’s born, 
someone dies. 

No population explosion, no prob- 



lem of food and water and leben- 
sraum, or liebensraum either. We 
could’ve saved a lot of worry and 
palaver over that one. Somebody — 
go ahead, captalize that: SomeBody 
had decided the world was full 
enough. So he — I mean big h. He 
had either to stop the income or 
accelerate the outgo. He chose the 
second. I had to admit: it was the 
first time I’d witnessed justice in 
nature. Population implosion. 

Oh Lord. The announcement. You 
remember it. It was ... it was awful. 
Uncle Charlie died yesterday . 
my God, I’m responsible! . the 
baby .... Uhnhuh. Granddad be- 
gan to look at his expectant daugjh- 
ter as if she were some sort of mon- 
ster. She wasn’t a monster, not real- 
ly. No. But she was killing him. Or 
working on it. Just as soon as she 
went into the delivery room. 

That’s personal It was horrible. 

It was elsewhere, too. Oh, every- 
body corroborated, all over the 
world. It was simple enough. All the 
evidence was there, it was just that 
Ike and I collated it first. I pub- 
lished the results of Control Group 
1 and saw that copies were sent 
to the USSR and everywhere else. 
By that time I was into Control 
Group 3: 73-and-a-half-year-olds, 

and I was advertising for a long- 
term observation: 70-year-olds. I 

tried to think ahead. 

Take China. The leaders were de- 
lighted (until they remembered how 
old they were). They didn’t have to 
worry about us any more. Not when 
The Plague would solve their prob- 
lem. Simple matter of numbers. 
Mathematics. And there weren’t a 



POPULATION IMPLOSION

lot of old people over there to 
start with (a lot of those pictures 
you saw of Asian women who look- 
ed about 90 were women with 
infants, remember?) But . Com- 
mimist or not, those people hadn’t 
got completely over venerating the 
old. For the first time in history 
Chinese women had a good reason to 
practice a little conception-control, 
stopping pregnancies, rather than 
using the time-honored method of 
family-size control: merely exposing 
the infants to die. Getting oneself 
enceinte was murdering one’s ven- 
erable grandfather. 

Same thing in Japan, of course, 
and Thainambodia and the rest. 

But we had the worst problem. 
The Land of Opportunity. We were 
strong . but outnumbered by all 
sorts of countries. Mostly enemies. 
Russia (which really hadn’t been 
an active enemy since the fifties, but 
. they were always ready) and 
China. Chou said about mid-century 
that after World War III there would 
remain ten million Americans and 
fifteen million Russians and 300 
million Chinese. Nice mind Chou 
had! But now he didn’t need WW 
III. All he had to do was reproduce 
us right out of business. He had 
more children to have more babies, 
and the old Asian Long View. (Not 
Chou; he was long dead. I’m talking 
about Huing, of course.) 

It became patriotic not to have 
babies. People damn near stopped. 
Little Debbie and Jeff — everybody 
born in the fifties and sixties was 
named Debbie and Kevin and Jeff- 
rey — married and bit their lips and 
didn’t have babies, for poor old 



Grandpop’s sake. Pill business boom- 
ed as Geritol sales began to dwin- 
dle. But popr old Grandpop hit the 
magic age and his heart stopped just 
the same. Debbie and Jeff got mad. 
It was all very well for us to sup- 
port the world; to ship wheat to 
Russia whilst she called us the same 
old names; to support the UN al- 
most singlehandedly; to send all 
those goodies to our enemies; to steal 
Jeff’s money to put into Grandpop’s 
pocket — or rather his physician’s 
pocket. But not having babies was 
personal. And when it didn’t do any 
good anyhow . well, I used to 
think we were due for a revolution 
around 1970, until I grew up and 
realized people wanted socialism. 
But we darn^ near had one in Year 
One of The Plague, and not over 
socialism, either. 

Over making babies! 

T here wasn’t any way to cover 
up. Somebody, somewhere, 
wasn’t holding up his end. When 
oldsters continued to die, when age 
72 became the barrier, everybody 
knew we were being conned. We 
weren’t having babies. But somebody 
was. And as soon as Grandpop died 
— heck with em! Debbie and Jeffrey 
couldn’t be worried about the Grand- 
pop next door. There was a, as the 
clicheists say, hue and cry. Meaning 
one hell of a lot of loud noise. Oh, 
the noises in the UN! The accusa- 
tions! Here we’d just grown up 
enough to admit we’d been cover- 
ing our pride for an old mistake all 
these decades, we’d just let China in 
. and bang! Right off the bat 
we’re* jumping all over them in the

UN! Mister Krishnapur swore his 
country was cooperating. Mister Vor- 
lonishev said quietly and smugly 
that his country had always cooper- 
ated and certainly hadn’t begun 
cheating now. But Mister Li said 
the same thing. 

Somebody was lying. A few 
African ladies here and there who 
hadn’t got the word couldn’t be 
affecting things the way they were 
being affected. 

We had a celebration in the hos- 
pital the night of Henry Clark’s 
72nd birthday. Tea and cake in his 
room. Booze in dixiecups in the 
resident’s lounge later. Henry Clark 
didn’t wake up the next morning. 

The story got itself put together 
later, but here’s how it happened, 
in sequence: The Russians had been 
shook. Really shook. Trigger fingers 
had never been so itchy before. They 
were scared we didn’t believe them. 
So for the first time in Lord knows 
when they invited us — secretly — 
to come in and have a look. They 
were on the level. Our observers 
confirmed that the Soviet govern- 
ment had proclidmed reproduction 
a crime against one’s fellow man 
and, ergo, the State. What was more 
important, our spies confirmed the 
observers .... 

Meanwhile Stephen Levee had 
got out of China, somehow, and 
brought back photographs and stor- 
ies. 

The Chinese were breeding like 
crazy. Practically at gunpoint. Told 
that the Americans were doing so. 
Patriotism: breed, that China may 
realize her destiny in the world. That 
sort of thing and threats were 



stamping out the oldest-veneration 
which had moved over to the U.S. 
sometime around 1930. 

We didn’t even announce it to 
the UN. 

For the first time since War Two, 
Washington and Moscow joined 
hands and said let’s get together 
and do it together. Secretly. China 
has been a common threat for 
years; now it’s far worse. Some 
people just can’t be got on with. For 
the first time since . 1941, I 
guess, the United States announced 
honestly that it was embarking on a 
war of aggression. Oh, it was self- 
defense, of course, and therefore a 
Holy War. All wars are Holy Wars, 
to somebody. This one was for 
Grandad and Grandma and Uncle 
Elmer. Except it wasn’t even a war. 

Stephen Levee came out of China 
on April 11th. On the 16th the 
President announced that on May 1 
he would make a major speech, and 
all the Lippmans and Huntley- 
Brinkleys wondered aloud and in 
print what he would have to say. 
Of course they pointed out that 
he had chosen to speak on the big- 
gest day in the Communist World. 
What he did was to review the prob- 
lem, the pleas, the agreements. The 
UN brawl. Then he displayed 
Stephen Levee’s films and read his 
reports, word for word, and intro- 
duced Levee and Mister Vorloni- 
shev and talked awhile and then 
announced that the governments of 
the United States and the Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics had de- 
clared war on the People’s Govern- 
ment of China. 

Retroactively: the buttons had 



POPULATION IMPLOSION

been pushed and the planes had 
swung Chinaward before his speech 
began. 

IV 

r ie Chinese were busily celebrat- 
ing May Day. Peking was full 
of aircraft and missiles and troops 
and tanks, parading under the eyes 
of Huing and hundreds of thousands 
of people, all of whom had of 
course gathered spontaneously; one 
assumed the Red Guards were di- 
recting traffic. Just as spontaneously 
they went to join their revered an- 
cestors before Huing even heard 
about the President’s speech. Pek- 
ing wasn’t hit with one bomb. The 
Chinese missile bases weren’t hit 
with one bomb each. The missiles 
came from half-a-dozen different 
directions and the bombs came from 
aircraft whose white stars and red 
stars had been effaced and replaced 
with big UN insignia. The whole 
operation was unbelievably success- 
ful, mainly because China had al- 
ways known we’d never do it. 

A missile got through and re- 
moved Colorado Springs and a tre- 
mendous chunk of mountain from 
our map. Two submarines sent four 
missiles streaming in toward Wash- 
ington and New York, and miracle 
of miracles all that propaganda from 
Denver was on the level; we were 
able to stop them! Not to mention 
the submarines. 

Rand-McNally started working on 
new maps; the old ones, showing 
China, were obsolete. Norad began 
reorganizing. Re-aiming. The Rus- 
sians were terribly sorry they’d 



goofed and sent Formosa down to 
join Atlantis, but little mistakes will 
happen, as Ve used to say when 
we napahned our own troops every 
now and again. There was one hell 
of a — sorry, here comes the cliche 
again — hue and cry in the UN. 
Then there were a lot of very big 
goggle eyes when Mister Vorloni- 
shev and Mister Davis and the Pres- 
ident stood up and said okay, we 
attacked them and we damn near 
destroyed China and what are you 
going to do about it? There were 
plenty of warheads and planes and 
silos left, and the allied nations of 
USASR were willing to use them if 
forced. 

They weren’t forced. The Aussie 
— funny — was the first to jump 
up and say he was going to call 
home and recommend his govern- 
ment broaden the alliance to three. 
By the time he was through there 
were so many delegates clamoring 
for recognition to climb aboard that 
the Secretary-General had to call 
for a general motion to save time. 
He got it. There was amazing unity. 

A month later we celebrated Wil- 
liam Michaels’s 71st birthday, and he 
woke up the next morning, too. 

B ut everyone seemed to have cele- 
brated the “war” in the same 
way. Nine months later, on approxi- 
mately February 1, Granddads start- 
ed dropping dead again. 

And in a few months it was all 
back again and in a few years life 
expectancy (certainty!) was below 
65, and Senator Martin — age 63 — 
introduced a bill to cut Social Secur- 
ity takeouts by two-thirds. He even 



56 



IF 





POPULATION IMPLOSION 



57 



managed to smile and say he’d never 
collect anyway. 

As far as we can see now the 
population of Planet Earth must re- 
main constant at approximately five 
billion people or less. The nearest 
we’ve come in our figures is 4,998,- 
987,834, and we’ve gotten that fig- 
ure three times. Apparently either 
the Prime Mover didn’t share our 
regard for numbers or he counted 
differently. Maybe he .meant for us 
to have six fingers. 

Somehow everybody just gave up 
and let it ride. For possibly the first 
time in history the young got their 
way. Twice the old managed to get 
us in war-shape again, and both 
times the young got together and 
said nothing doing. We learned pret- 
ty quickly that you don’t have wars 
if tihe senators are invited to go, 
or if a few million young men, in 
both nations involved, say no. And 
when they suggest that if overgrown 
children insist on settling things by 
violence, let’s try the old method: 
personal trial-by-combat ... I The 
President and the Prime Minister 
backed down pretty fast while the 
rest of us guffawed at the editorial 
cartoons. 

They might as well have gone 
along. Within a year die Plague had 
got them both anyhow. 

Meanwhile a lot of us were look- 
ing for answers. Why? 

Okay. There was a rule: another 
Natural Law; really a restatement 
of the old one: survival, after all, 
of the fittest. This law said there 
shall not be more than approximate- 
ly 5x10^ personnel in existence on 
Plan^ Earth at any one time. Fine, 



Why? I figured once again we had 
ourselves an effect, not a cause. Ef- 
fect: the Plague. Causative effect: 
our having reached such-and-such a 
population figure. Causative effect: 
There Shall Not be more than such- 
and-such many people. But it was 
an effect, not a cause. 

Okay. Why? 

Well, here’s a theory. If it doesn’t 
happen to agree with your religion, 
that’s tough; make up your own 
theory. Plenty of people have made 
up their own religions. This one 
represents the thinking of a lot of 
people over a lot of centuries. It’s 
been the basis for a lot of religions 
both before and since Christianity. 
There was some truth to the Mystery 
Religions — certainly Paul respected 
them highly. There is some, too, in 
Christianity, in Judaism, Bud- 
dhism and. Islam. Mostly Buddhism, 
I guess. It was in Christianity, too, 
originally; called Gnosticism. The 
early Christians stamped it out. Too 
hard to sell. Isn’t that just like Man 
trying to interpret God? Those first 
several centuries were mostly sales- 
manship centuries, and the Roman 
state religion and Mithraism were 
tough foes. Even so the original con- 
cepts may have remained if the 
Empress Theodora hadn’t so ada- 
mantly stamped them out. And even 
so the whole new faith might have 
gone by the board if the Emperor 
Julian hadn’t got himself killed in 
battle just when he was starting to 
stamp out Christianity. {There* s a 
death I’d like to investigate!) 

Reincarnation. The ring of re- 
turn. You die, but your life-force 
or soul or whatever you wish to

call it keeps coming back. Oh, not 
as bugs or cattle; your life-force is 
a mind, and enters only human be- 
ings. Without memories, usually. Ex- 
cept i>eople who have funny djcams 
in full color ... or wind up nuts 
on some period of history without 
knowing why. Easy. You were there, 
once. 

L ook, just keep your mind on 
Hamlet’s words that there are 
more things in heaven and earth 
than are dreamt of in your philoso- 
phy. And try to remember that a 
closed mind is pretty much like a 
closed door . there can’t be much 
traffic, either way. 

The idea is we have to try, over 
and over, no matter how long or 
how many corporate lives it takes, 
to be “good enough to retire” (I’m 
simplifying, naturally). If you com- 
mit six crimes (let’s keep it straight 
and say “against nature,” and I’m 
not talking about that implied defi- 
nition of “Crimes against Nature” 
lurking like rattlesnakes in our law- 
books, either. Men pretend to be so 
horrified by Sodom and Gomorrah 
they won’t even use the words . 
yet nowhere in that old book does 
it say what the crime of those two 
cities was! For all we know it may 
have been over-defoliation or water 
or air pollution; those are crimes 
against nature, aren’t they?) 

Anyhow, if you conunitted six 
crimes in life #1 while you were 
Babble-babble of Memphis in 6,000 
BC, you’ve got to compensate/atone 
for them somewhere, somewhen else. 
Your life-force seeks at/one/ment, 
whether you as Babble-babble do or 



not. As B-b you died and your life- 
force (go ahead and use soul if you 
feel you must) hung around without 
drawing a new body until 1,000 BC. 
There weren’t many bodies around 
then, remember; there was a long 
wait between assignments. You be- 
came a Hellenic peasant. You 
“atoned” for three of the crimes, 
but committed two new ones before 
you died. You’ve moved up one 
notch. You’ve got five bad deeds 
to wipe off the master ledger. But 
. you will have the opportunity; 
the man said you would be born 
again, didn’t he? You think he 
meant by being splashed a little? 

As a Pfc. under Titus you held 
your own. You died. Your ego 
waited around some more, still with 
five black marks. Back in Memphis 
you had killed without mercy and 
had died of old age as a lot of 
killers do . they do NOT die by 
the sword . that time. Sometime. 
Someplace. As a serf or maybe as a 
woman accused of witchcraft in the 
Middle Ages you had such a hard 
time you cut ^e tally down to two. 
Surely there are special rules for 
those murdered in the name of God. 
Maybe you were lucky enough to be 
sworded. 

You came back as Rudolf Schick- 
ner, say chief gas man at Auschwitz. 
Oops. Back to the end of the line. 
Next time you came back as . 
well, that’s the system, anyhow. And 
of course you’re coming back a lot 
more frequently now. That’s the 
whole point. 

At the beginning, whatever and 
whenever that “is,” all life-forces 
were made. All the souls. All of

them. None has been created/acti- 
vated since. 

Yes. You get the point. There 
aren’t six billion in AD 2,000. And 
there won’t be six billion people in 
the world by 2,500, either, or AD 
5,000. There never will be. 

All the souls have been used up. 

D on’t call me a mystic. Try to 
open up your mind a little, let 
the light shine on the cobwebs of 
preconceptions. And remember I’ve 
had 'no religion save Ad major em 
hominis gloriam since I was 23 years 
old. And, if you don’t like that 
theory, think up another. 

So here we are. No more inter-

some of them don’t have gray hair.

Do? Nothing. I don’t think you 
can. Oh, I may be wrong, but I’ve 
got plenty of agreement. Sure, maybe 
you can find a way out of it. Maybe 
if a million people leave Earth to 
colonize another planet we can add 
a million human beings to the ledger 
and stop writing PLAGUE on death- 
certificates for a while . while we 
get more ships ready. I don’t think 
so. I think we’re at five billion, give 
or take a few, for keeps. Holding, 
situation no-go. It’s up to you. Sure, 
there’ll be a stop. A temporary one, 
anyhow. When it reaches the point 
that parents give birth and both die 
the instant twins are born, it will be 
over for a while. And maybe some- 
body will start acting sensibly. But 
unless you stop horsing around 
you’re going to have a life expect- 
ancy of twenty and then fifteen and 
then Lord knows what, eventually.

Larrow had only one hope of escape: 
to fake a new identify. Too bad the 
new one was even more hotly pursued! 



I 

Larrow rolled over, trying 
A to escape the hands and voices. 
But there’d been a stinging in his 
left arm, and now some stimulant 
was invading his blood, driving out 
the earlier poison, rallying him. 
Awareness grew. Painfully, he roll- 
ed onto his back and got his eyes 
open. The blob above him resolved 
itself into the chubby white-furred 
face of Wioon Lek, h}s Meroban 



employer. “What . where . .” 
Another Meroban, with the man- 
ner of a doctor, said in his rumbling 
voice, “A few moments, man Lar- 
row. Lie still. You will be strong.” 
Tom sighed and lay back. His 
head ached like the devil, and there 
was a bitter sickening taste in his 
mouth. He let his eyes focus and 
saw that he was in Ws own apart- 
ment in the Lek compound, where 
he’d been Living these two years on 
Merob.

Wioon Lek’s round face relaxed 
into the all-embracing Meroban 
smile. “This is marvelous, Tom! 
Here we’d closed up shop in mourn- 
ing, and all the time you were 
here! What happened?” 

Tom looked at him for a mo- 
ment in puzzlement. Sometimes he 
still didn’t grasp a Meroban idiom 
completely. Suddenly, Wioon’s ques- 
tion triggered memory. He jerked 
up to a sitting position, got his feet 
off the bed and hauled himself 
upright, unsteadily. “I was gassed, 
that’s what happened! I opened the 
door, and a cloud of something 
hit me in the face! I remember 
doubling over and coughing, then 
I fell!” He took four unsteady steps 
toward the closet, reached in and 
fumbled in the breast pocket of his 
over jacket. He sighed with relief. 
“Good. For a moment I thought 
maybe my passport and ticket — ” 
He went silent, staring at the pass- 
port. The picture on it was of a 
human, but it was the face of a 
stranger. 

Anger seized him. He threw the 
ticket and passport down on the 
bed. “It was robbery! Somebody 
switched on me! Well, he made 
a mistake leaving his own papers! 
When I catch up with him — ” 

Wioon was staring at him. Sud- 
denly the Meroban burst out, “But 
of course! You do not know; you 
have been not conscious all the 
time!” He made a gesture that was 
both aghast and pious. “Peace on 
the stranger. Friend Tom, and do 
not be in a hurry to catch up with 
him. Obviously he stole your tick- 
et because the ship Vreyol Kway 
was going direct to Earth. But Vre- 



yol Kway blew up just as she was 
beginning to accelerate out of or- 
bit.” He sigh^, then broke into 
the smile again. “But that is his mis- 
fortune and your good luck, and 
ours!” Wioon’s pudgy three-digited 
hand went to a pocket, pulled out 
a jackphone. “I must share the 
good news!” Then, with the flat, 
rectangular instrument near his bps, 
he stopped. “But wiait.” He ambled 
over to a chair and lowered his 
squat, broad form into it. “I must 
think.” 

Tom stood impatiently. Finally he 
said, “What’s there to think about, 
sir? I’m sorry to hear about the 
ship. But I’ve still got to get off- 
planet fast. Unless, under the cir- 
cumstances, they’d extend the dead- 
line for me.” 

Wioon’s tiny flesh-enfolded eyes 
blinked in negation. “The Fists will 
make no such allowance. They’ll be 
all the more furious, because the 
disaster will anger not only Vreyol, 
but Earth. There were sixty humans 
aboard, you know. Friend Tom, that 
is not why I am worried. Do you 
not see? You, of all the passengers, 
did not catch the ship. Therefore 
you will be suspected of some com- 
plicity.” 

T om stared at him for a moment. 

Wioon was right; the Fists were 
nervous in their newly seized pow- 
er. “Well, danm it . ...” He 
stepped to the bed and picked up 
the documents. “This ticket my un- 
known benefactor left . Obolis, 
for Zenner Hell. Directly away from 
Earth. But at least it’s a transfer 
point. And it’s all I’ll get, this late.” 
He frowned at the passport. “But

he didn’t look like me at all. A 
lot darker, and plump in the cheeks. 
Santos Yberra was his name.” He 
looked up at Wioon. “I suppose it 
was a decent gesture, leaving these, 
hut how could I possibly use them? 
The ticket’s in his name, and I’d 
have to show the passport.” 

Wioon eyed him thoughtfully. “I 
shall guess that he expected you 
to get the picture altered. Just as 
he must have altered yours. Ob- 
viously, he knew various things 
about you. And about me, since 
he was able to sneak into the com- 
pound and ambush you in your 
own apartment. He was no bump- 
kin. I must shake up my security 
forces again, yes?” 

Tom said uncertainly, “Well, it’s 
my mess, sir. You’ve got trouble 
enough of your own, with the Fists 
suspecting everybody of being coun- 
terrevolutionists.” 

Wioon held up a pudgy white- 
furred hand. “No, no, you’re still 
my employee. I’m depending upon 
you to keep my affairs alive on 
Earth. And eventually . well, the 
Fists will not be in power forever. 
But let us think. Technicians can 
alter the passport photograph. But 
even then. I’m apprehensive about 
your using that ticket.” 

“Why?” 

“Consider, Friend Tom. Why did 
this burglar leave it? Not charity, 
I think. He was desperate to be off 
Merob a day early. That suggests 
that someone was after him, or at 
least that he needed to cover his 
trail. If you use his ticket you are 
the decoy, yes?” 

Tom rubbed at his throbbing tem- 
ples; “Oh, I don’t know, and I don’t 



care. Can’t we find out who he 
was?” 

Wioon looked unhappy. “I shall 
try, of course. But with things in 
such a mulligan .... Well, first 
things first, yes? Let’s get that pho- 
tograph replaced with yours.” He 
raised the jackphone and spoke close 
to it at some length; thought a 
moment and added, “Ends. Second 
message. To Technician Daal Jhee. 
Wioon speaks. Can you favor us 
with your presence in man Larrow’s 
apartment at once, utmost secret? 
Ends.” He heaved himself out of 
the chair, waddled over to the near- 
est wall receptacle and pushed the 
prong end of the phone into it. The 
two messages would flash to their 
destination by wire. 

Tom, as much Meroban as Ter- 
ran in his thinking now, said auto- 
matically, “Whatever I can do to 
unburden myself of this debt . .” 

Wioon waved off the thanks. “No, 
no, it is nothing.” Then he looked 
thoughtful. “Zenner . yes, it 
could go via Zenner. There is one 
small favor you could perform. 
Friend Tom. I have promised an 
old comrade to get an heirloom to 
him safely. A thing of only moder- 
ate value, but dear to him. My 
agent on Zenner — Paib Salang; 
you have met him — will recognize 
it and know where to send it.” He 
frowned in thought. “I do not want 
to endanger you. Being an heirloom 
of the Dynasty, it would cause the 
Fists to be harsh with anyone tak- 
ing it off-planet.” He smiled ab- 
ruptly. “But it can be disguised. It 
is only a finger-ring. A plastic over- 
lay upon the gem, with your initials 
on it in Terr an script. And soft 



64 



IF 




metal added to the inside of the 
band, with Terran inscriptions. If 
you will wear it at all times . 

“Of course,” Tom said. He could 
swallow his aversion to rings. 

Wioon beamed. “Well, then.” He 
glanced toward the door, his stub- 
by white-furred ears twitching. 
“Daal arrives. I will see you be- 
fore you leave; now I must go and 
tend to the ring. Best — do you 
not think — you stay here until 
your escort comes? I can assure 
your safety to the port, I believe. 
And Obolis is a Boklan ship, so 
the Fists will not dare tamper with 
her. And no phone calls, yes? It 
must not be known you are still 
alive.” 

D aal, with whom Tom had work- 
ed, was about Wioon’s height 
— barely five feet — but slightly 
less broad. He peered at the pho- 
tograph. “Yes, I can fix it, in two 
hours. Is there that much time?” 
Tom nodded. **Obolis doesn’t 
leave until near midnight. What will 
you have to do?” 

Daal tapped the plastic document 
with a thumb. “Grind this away 
carefully, until the picture is gone. 
Spray on sensitized plastic, imprint 
your picture, cover it with more 
plastic and put the whole thing in 
a hot press. It will stand casual in- 
spection. It will not pass examination 
with fluoroscopes or such. This pass- 
port seems to have been made on 
Vreyol. I cannot counterfeit their 
plastic or the antifraud patterns.” 
Tom said, “Fll have to risk it. 
If I don’t get off-planet, it’s prison 
camp or worse anyway. How about 
the description?” 



“The height is close enough — 
five^ten against your tfive-eleven. 
And who can guarantee weight, 
travelling among different races? Or 
the degree of skin tan, in your 
case? There’s only the color of 
your eyes to worry about. But I’ll 
print your picture a little dark, so the 
gray might be interpreted as black.” 
“All right,” Tom said. “Wioon 
mentioned escort to the field. Do 
you know about that?” 

Daal’s wide mouth drooped. “I 
am to go. Also a policeman, ostensi- 
bly gone over to the Fists but actual- 
ly still in our employ. Excuse me 
now, please.” 

II 

spent an hour going through 
A his luggage to get rid of all 
identifying marks. He interrupted 
that to listen to a newscast. The big 
story, of course, was the ship dis- 
aster. Vreyol Kway had disintegrat- 
ed so completely there were few 
corpses to identify. The crew of a 
trashboat, the last to leave her, was 
in custody and no doubt being in- 
terrogated. Various other ships in 
orbit, including Obolis, had veered 
to avoid the spreading mess of radio- 
active debris. There was no re- 
action from the Vreyolan ambassa- 
dor — it would be many hours be- 
fore the news reached Vreyol, and 
as many more before anything came 
back. Vreyol was populated by the 
same race as Merob, but {X)l ideal- 
ly separate. It wasn’t as potent as 
Bokl, which had a near-monopoly 
on commercial shipping and travel 
among the nearby stars, but the 
Fists didn’t want Vreyol’s enmity.

The ill-will of Earth hardly mat- 
tered. In space, Terra was still small 
potatoes. 

He returned to his baggage and 
got it repacked. Then he paced the 
apartment restlessly, a plastijar of 
Meroban beer in his hand. It seem- 
ed hours before a chime came from 
the door. He glanced at the viewer 
and saw Wioon’s beaming image. 
“Come.” 

The door slid open, and his em- 
ployer waddled in. “Things are go- 
ing well. Friend Tom. Daal has done 
a fine job with the passport. I’ve 
been able to arrange for you to 
go aboard the shuttleboat prompt- 
ly, with a group of other passen- 
gers who have all been identified, 
so there’ll be no delay.” He glanced 
at Tom’s three valises. “All ready, 
yes? We’ll send those on aliead so 
they’ll be inspected and put in your 
stateroom. You’ll have a pleasant 
trip; the Bokla are great hands at 
making comfort. You’ll have to be 
watchful, of course.” He fished in 
a pouch of his apron-belt — the 
only garment most Merobans wore 
indoors — and pulled out a heavy 
finger-ring. “Try it on, yes?” 

Not too happily, Tom slid it on 
the largest finger of his left hand. 
It was snug. He stared at the ini- 
tials on the stone. “What — oh, 
of course. S. Y. I’m not supposed 
to be Tom Larrow, am I?” 

Wioon regarded him gravely out 
of almost-closed eyes. “You must 
not lapse. You are Santos Yberra, 
until Paib Salang can smuggle you 
to safety. Oh, did I not tell you 
— identify yourself as Code Nine 
Four Seven. That will inform Paib 
he is to extend you unlimited ac- 



count and. assist you to Earth. You 
and he will work out arrange- 
ments fqr the immediate future of 
my Earth trade, yes? I expect to 
route it through Zenner for a while, 
but I dare not leave Merob myself 
just now.” He held out a white- 
furred hand. “Daal will be here be- 
fore long to take you to the port. 
Until next we meet, yes?” 

T he gray-uniformed Fist at the 
turnstile gave the passport a 
hard look, lifted his head to peer 
at Tom and brusquely waved him 
through. At the foot of the esca- 
lator to the shuttleboat waited a 
Boklan officer in a very neat white 
uniform. He was long of torso and 
neck, short-limbed in proportion, 
with a face that was mostly nose 
or muzzle. He gave the passport 
one swift scrutiny, nodded down at 
Tom from his seven-foot-plus height 
and said in good Meroban, “Favor 
us by boarding, man Yberra, yes?” 
Tom waited his turn at the es- 
calator, which was crowded. Half- 
way up he turned to look back. 

He was in time to witness a swift, 
shocking episode. 

Daal and the helmeted policeman 
who’d flown them here were stand- 
ing against the rear wall of the vast 
chamber. A sudden bellow of the 
loudspeaker system made them look 
up, with the rest of the crowd. An 
instant later, squads of Fist troopers 
in their gray uniforms burst into 
the chamber, carrying short ugly 
weap>ons. 

Tom saw Daal’s eyes squeeze shut 
in anguish, then the technician was 
running with the deceptive Mero- 
ban gait. The crowd erupted with 



66 



IF 




cries of fear and became a mob, 
surging away from the action. 
Troopers swiveled, aiming their guns 
at Daal. A dozen or more blinding, 
spitting beams converged on him, 
aiming for the lower legs. Tom 
heard his scream above the tumult. 
The technician went tumbling and 
lay in a writhing knot, his legs noth- 
ing but blackened stumps. Tom was 
shouting in English, “No! No!” and 
fighting to get back down the es- 
calator, but the panicking passen- 
gers behind him bore him along 
before them. He grabbed the rail 
and clung. He saw the policeman 
who’d come with him and Daal stare 
fixedly at the crippled technician. 

Suddenly Daal’s head seemed to 
burst. 

Now there was panic among the 
troopers. They spun, darting fran- 
tic looks around, some of them fir- 
ing their beamers wildly. The helm- 
eted policeman stood against the 
wall, his eyes moving in jerks, to 
remain fixed for an instant at a 
time. A trooper’s head burst open, 
and this time Tom saw the small 
h^^phen of incandescence that 
caused it. Two more troopers went 
down. A Meroban near Tom shout- 
ed in terror, “The Elite! A Stare!” 

Five troopers were dead now, but 
the others had found the source of 
the terrible weapon. Beams converg- 
ed on the policeman, and he went 
down in a blackened heap that 
stiiTed for only a moment. 

Limp with horror, Tom was car- 
ried up the escalator, wedged in 
among the short but heavy Mero- 
bans, who comprised most of the 
passenger Hst. At the top, a white- 
uniformed Bokl was urging, “This 



way, please! This way!” Tom went 
numbly where he was directed, 
found himself in a lounge, let him- 
self be guided to a seat. The decor 
and furniture were Meroban. Some- 
how he answered a Bokl steward. 
“Dis-distilled spirits, with hampa 
juice.” 

He sat, automatically sipping the 
sweet-tart drink. After a while a 
Meroban came and sat down across 
the small table from him. “Please, 
may I? An awful thing, yes?” 

''T^m nodded, then remembered 
X the Meroban gesture of palms- 
up. The Meroban stared at Tom’s 
hands. “Five digits, just as they say. 
Excuse me. I am Ussmed, a modest 
businessman. Unless you have been 
on Merob a long time, you have not 
seen the Stare before, yes?” 

Tom managed, “Uh, no. I’d heard 
rumors, of course. But I thought the 
Elite were all hunted out.” 

The Meroban squeezed his eyes 
shut. “So did the Fists. But ob- 
viously at least one escaped. Like 
sorcery, is it not? But quite tech- 
nological. Did you notice that be- 
fore he died, the Elite exploded his 
own head and the helmet?” 

“No. I — I wasn’t in position to 
see very well.” 

“He did,” the Meroban said. 
“They all did. And the secret died 
with them. Not one went over to the 
Fists, you know. The helmet, of 
course, looks exactly like an or- 
dinary police one. But in addition 
to the radio, there is a lot more 
built in. The energy is translocated 
to the target in somewhat the same 
way a ship is translocated between 
the stars. That much is known. But

the talk is that the whole technolo- 
gy would fill a great many books. 
As to know how the eyes are made 
to serve as rangefinders, and how 
the weapon is triggered, you can 
hear as many theories as you like. 
Some say the helmet reads the 
natural muscle movements and nerve 
impulses. Others say tiny instru- 
ments are implanted in the Elite’s 
head. One thing is certain — a long 
period of training was needed. I 
had a nephew who took it, though 
of course he would not tell me so. 
He died in the coup.” The Mero- 
ban made a gesture of sorrow. “I 
guess you are angry with the Fists 
for hustling you off Merob, yes?” 
Tom’s mind was beginning to 
work again. He mustn’t forget his 
pose, or that this stranger might not 
be an innocent businessman. Wioon 
had dug out a little of Yberra’s 
history. “I’ve only been on the plan- 
et a short time, and hadn’t made any 
connections. I’d probably have been 
leaving anyway.” 

The Meroban asked, “Have you 
business on Zenner?” 

“No, except that I may look for 
work there. Excuse me; I’m Santos 
Yberra. I call myself a distribution 
engineer. Actually my trade involves 
a knowledge of packaging, preserva- 
tion, shipping and so on. I’d hoped 
to find work on Merob, but didn’t.” 
Ussmed said, “Things have not 
been normal. But Zenner is a good 
prospect. The Bokla settled it as a 
transfer point, you know. What in- 
dustry there is supports shipping and 
travel. Excuse me, perhaps I am 
boring you. Perhaps you have been 
to Zenner before?” 

“No. Only Vreyol and Merob, 



outside the Terran planetary sys- 
tem.” • 

“I see. Well, excuse me, yes? I 
must get to my stateroom. Perhaps 
we can talk again.” 

O bolis was cylindrical, four times 
as long as her diameter — a 
proportion that, as she accelerated 
with her axis along the line of 
flight, was foreshortening; at the 
velocity needed for translocation, 
she would fit well enough into the 
spherical TL field. Acceleration 
would require a little less than 
eighty Terran hours. Deceleration, 
near Zenner — assuming TL was 
perfect — would take an equal 
time. TL itself would occupy only 
a few painstakingly calculated min- 
utes. 

Tom’s stateroom was about a 
third of the way back from the nose, 
and against Superwall C; which 
meant it was the nearest of the 
eight rooms on his radial corridor to 
the lounges, dining rooms, theaters 
and such in the core of the ship. 
Also, it placed him farthest of the 
eight from the outer Superwalls — 
an advantage, theoretically, though 
even in the extremely rare event of 
a debris-hit, damage would hardly 
penetrate within Superwall B. 

The stateroom was luxurious, of 
course. Compared to the cost of 
accelerating and translocating a 
ship, the accommodations didn’t 
count. His total floorspace was 
about fifteen by thirty-five feet, di- 
vided into a parlor, bedroom, bath 
and kitchenette. With his mind still 
mainly on the episode at the space- 
port, he prowl^ about the quar- 
ters, looking at the alien fittings.

IF 




Things were marked in Boklan, 
which he couldn’t read, but little 
self-adhesive tags had been stuck 
on, giving Meroban translations. He 
fiddled with the grav controls, set 
tliem back to point seven G. He 
opened the refrigerator door and 
peered inside. There were a few 
basic rations — dried stuff in plas- 
tic, a shelf of seasonings, a pack- 
age of plastic bags in case he wanted 
to store food. He could buy a wide 
variety of stuff aboard, if he wanted 
to cook, which he didn’t. He went 
back to the sitting room. 

He found himself idly calculat- 
ing cubic feet. Certainly a lot of 
cargo could be stored in here. There 
was far more living space than two 
or three people would need. But 
that was deliberate. Some passengers 
needed it, to forget that they were 
in a capsule of steel with all of 
ruthless space just outside. Even the 
corridors (his back door opened 
onto a second one) gave no hint that 
the stateroom was one or more than 
a thousand packed between Super- 
walls B and C. You only saw eight 
at a time. 

He dialed a seascape for one of 
the vistawalls and sat half watching 
it for a while, then irritably tuned 
out the surf sound and went look- 
ing for the radio receiver dials. He 
found they were on the same panel 
that controlled the lights. Obolis 
was well away from Merob now, but 
the newscasts could still overtake 
her. 

There were reports, as had be- 
come usual recently, of Dynasty 
plots foiled and a 'highly edited 
account of the affair at the port. 
Tom was about to ti^n the stuff off 



when somethinig caught his atten- 
tion. The announcer was saying, 
“ — new developmenits in the deaii 
of the eminent industrialist and im- 
porter, Wioon Lek.” 

Tom froze, halfway out of his 
chair. The voice went on, “Gov- 
ernment sources confirm the re- 
ports of suicide. It is now revealed, 
though, that traces of poisons other 
than the one that killed him have 
been found in his blood. One phar- 
macologist states tibat these are of 
a type used in interrogation of un- 
willing witnesses. Furthermore, 
there are signs that Wioon wias not 
alone at the time of his death. 

“There is no hint of how these 
so-called ‘truth serums’ may have 
been admioistered. However, it has 
been discovered that the suicide 
poison was in a small capsule sur- 
gically implanted in Wioon’s 
tongue. The industrialist was able 
to kill himself by biting on it. 

“A Government spokesman has 
suggested that Wioon was the vic- 
tim of counter-revolutionaries, and 
that he died rather than reveal 
secrets they might have used. 

“Control of Wioon’s vast eco- 
nomic empire has been assumbed by 
the Government pending decisions.’’ 

The report turned to something 
else. Tom slowly walked over and 
turned it off. He stood in a daze, 
trying to realize it was not just 
words he’d been hearing — Wioon 
was really dead. His mind refused 
to accept it. He saw Wioon as he’d 
last seen him — furred hand ex- 
tended in farewell, round face beam- 
ing, full of life. “No,” he muttered, 
“it’s some propaganda story. Some 
trick!”

But he knew, of course, that it 
wasn’t. He went back and sat down, 
staring without attention at the surg- 
ing seascape. He had no idea how 
long he’d sat there before the state- 
room com pinged. At the second 
ping he mustered himself. “Yes?” 
“Passenger Yberra?” 

“Yes. What do you want?” 

“This is Fourth Officer Hweki. A 
small question has arisen. Would 
it be convenient for you to come to 
my office, bringing your identity 
papers? A crewman will arrive 
shortly to guide you.” 

Ill 

6^T)lease sit down, man Yberra.” 
1 Hweki himself had only half 
arisen, probably because he didn’t 
want to tower over his visitors. 
The second visitor, seated to one 
side of the desk, was the Meroban 
Ussmed. 

Hweki’s eyes and forehead, at 
least, were passably humanoid. The 
rest of his face was mostly a long 
nose — or muzzle; the mouth was 
a mere line below the flaring nos- 
trils; the chin no more prominent 
than a dog’s. The ears were point- 
ed and mobile, covered with short 
gray fur like the rest of his face. The 
irises of eyes were light yellow, with 
contrasting black pupils. The neck 
was a full twelve inches long, sturdy 
but flexible. His uniform was white, 
with green piping, very neat. The 
only insignia was on the right breast, 
the Bokl Lines mark of two inter- 
secting circles. Each side of the 
green collar bore the Boklan num- 
eral four. 



Hweki looked at Tom along his 
muzzle for ^ minute, gravely, but 
without discourtesy, then continued 
in excellent Meroban. “It is a rule of 
the Line, passenger Yberra, that any 
accuser must face the accused. Pas- 
senger Ussmed is an agent of the 
Meroban Government. He has a 
list of passengers and data on some. 
He informs me that there is no 
record of anyone named Santos 
Yberra arriving on Merob.” 

Ussmed, who was angry but try- 
ing to hide it, said placatingly, “It 
is not necessarily an accusation, man 
Yberra. I merely report a discrep- 
ancy. It is my duty.” 

If a Bokl could have smiled, 
Hweki obviously would have done 
so. “Can you explain, passenger 
Yberra?” 

There seemed to be a hard lump 
in Tom’s stomach. “I only arrived 
less than three divs ago. There’s 
been a lot of records lost, or destroy- 
ed, in that time.” 

“From where did you arrive, 
please?” 

“From Vreyol.” 

“Could I see your passport?” 
Tom slowly handed the docu- 
ment across the desk. Ussmed was 
leaning forward, trying to see. 
Hweki raised his muzzle toward 
Tom. “May I?” At Tom’s nod, he 
handed Ussmed the passport. 

The Meroban peered at it a while. 
“It looks genuine. But a scientific 
examination . ” 

Hweki held out a four-digited 
hand. “We’ll give it that, of course. 
It will only take a few minutes.” 
He pressed one of a row of studs 
on his desk, then dropped the pass- 



70 



IF 




port into a slot. “Also we’ll send 
a message drone to Vreyol. An an- 
swer should be at Zenner by the 
time we’re within radio range. Mean- 
while, passenger Ussmed, could you 
detail your suspicions?” 

Ussmed scowled, then rumbled, 
It is sufficient crime if this Ter- 
ran arrived on Merob, or left, un- 
der a false name. By treaty, I ask 
that you deliver him to the Mero- 
ban embassy as soon as we reach 
2^nner.” 

Hweki inclined his head polite- 
ly. “If I am convinced. Perhaps you 
have guessed, passenger Yberra, that 
I am ship’s Security Officer. In the 
Meroban, and I think the Terran 
idiom, a spy. I will give you a copy 
of ship’s regulations if you wish, 
so you may know my duty and your 
rights.” 

Tom said, “No, thank you.” 

The two aliens sat watching him 
for a minute, or maybe they were 
just waiting. Finally there was a 
ping, and the passport popped from 
the slot, with a note clipped to it. 
Tom sat with dull dread as Hweki 
read the note. 

The Bokl aimed his muzzle first 
at Ussmed, then at Tom. “This is 
a genuine Vreyolan passport. There 
is no sign of any tampering.” 

U ssmed was on his feet, trying 
to control his anger. “I ask 
that this man be confined, and 
that our technicians be allowed to 
examine the passport when we reach 
Zenner.” 

Hweki said mildly, “We are all 
confined here aboard ship, yes? As 
to the passport, I wjll neither agree 



nor refuse now. Before we arrive, 
we will have been in contact with 
my own government and will have 
heard from Vreyol.” 

Ussmed stood a moment, then 
said curtly, “With your permission.” 
Without waiting for it, he walked 
to the door. He didn’t quite slam it 
behind him. 

Tom got to his feet, bewildered 
at his reprieve. Hweki said, “Please? 
A question or two.” Tom sat down 
again. 

The Bokl looked along his muzzle 
thoughtfully. “Ussmed has repeat- 
ed his conversation with you, so 
I know a little of your background. 
You were seeking employment on 
Merob, yes? And in your line, Wioon 
Lek, Chartered, was the most im- 
portant firm. Did you apply there?” 
Tom said carefully, “Yes. But this 
Fist thing came up . .” 

Hweki inclined his head. “Un- 
fortunate timing. Have you heard 
that Wioon himself is dead?” 

“I . heard a newscast about 
it.” 

Hweki glanced at an instrument 
on the wall. “We are out of news- 
cast range now, though we still 
have an official beam. Thank you, 
passenger Yberra. I am very sorry 
this has come up.” 

Tom left, his mind churning. 
What about the passport? Was 
Hweki holding back something? Had 
they actually found the tampering? 
And what other irregularities might 
be turned up on Vreyol? Santos 
Yberra seemed to have been the 
kind to wallow in irregularities. 

Shoud Tom turn back and tell 
Hweki the whole thing? He couldn’t

see how he dared. It would still 
put him in the hands of the Fists. 
Besides, there was still Paib Salang. 
The Fists would hardly be able to 
to move in on Wioon’s holding, 
except on Merob, right away. Paib 
could probably still get Tom to 
Earth. And there was the finger- 
ring. He felt of it absently as he 
walked slowly along a corridor. 
Wioon had wanted to get it to its 
owned. Tom owed him that and a 
lot more. 

In any case, it would be foolish 
to turn himself in now. There were 
many hours left before TL, and 
many more before they reached 
Zenner. He should at least preserve 
the option. 

He glanced around. Right now he 
didn’t want the solitude of his state- 
room. Somewhere he’d passed a 
lounge, on the way to Hweki’s 
office .... 

He found a directory-sign and 
arrows, and followed them to the 
lounge. He could certainly use a 
drink. 

I t was part of Boklan Lines serv- 
ice to have lounges and dining 
rooms reflecting a variety of cul- 
tures. All the numerous lounges 
and dining rooms, though, were also 
serving Meroban items on this trip, 
since the passengers were practical- 
ly aU Meroban. He found a stool 
at the bar and told the polite Bok- 
lan bartender, “Spirits, with hampa 
juice.” 

He sat morosely, sipping and let- 
ting his eyes rove around. A lot 
of cargo space in here, too. He 
looked around for the air-condition- 



ing vents. Well placed, and ample. 
This ship inade Meroban and Vre- 
yolan ships look primitive and 
Earth’s few ships downright miser- 
able. The tank of greenery at one 
end of this lounge, under the ac- 
tinic lights — that alone almost 
equaled the total hydroponics of any 
Earth ship. 

He turned and looked into the 
darkened end of the room. There 
were tables there, some of them 
screened, where a scattering of Mer- 
obans sat talking and drinking. Their 
voices were a low bass murmur. He 
could almost imagine he wasn’t in 
space at all. This could be some 
peaceful lounge on Merob, ‘before 
the trouble, quiet, luxurious, faintly 
scented with something like lavender. 

The Bokla had been in the busi- 
ness a long time, of course. But it 
was no wonder they dominated it. 

He jumped as a human voice be- 
hind him said in English, “Your 
hands. They always stare at your 
hands.” 

He turned. A man was standing 
there, smiling. He was a little short- 
er than Tom, rather slight, blond, 
with young blue eyes. “Mind if I 
sit down?” 

Tom said automatically, “Of 
course not. What about my hands?” 

The man slid onto a stool. “Good 
to hear English again! I’m Ren- 
frow Cull an. People call me Cull, 
unless I owe them money, or they 
want to borrow it. I don’t mean 
your hands in particular; I mean, 
human hands. The bartender was 
just staring at mine. You’d think 
five digits were a violation of nat- 
ural law.”

IF 




Tom foimd himself glad of hu- 
man company. “I’m Santos Yberra. I 
knew there were other people aboard, 
but you’re the first I’ve run into.” 
Cullan called to the bartender, 
“Two of whatever he had.” He 
pointed to Tom’s glass. To Tom, 
he said, “I saw you when you came 
aboard. Ugly thing back there, 
wasn’t it?” 

Tom nodded slowly. “As ugly as 
I want to see. I don’t think I really 
bdieved in the Elite weapon until 
I saw it.” 

Cullan said, “Same here. How 
long were you on Merob? I never 
saw you around.” 

Tom said carefully, “Less than 
three divs.” 

Cullan looked absently around 
the room. “They sure move a lot 
of drinks during a trip. I was on 
Merob over a year.” He named a 
city a few hundred miles from Port 
City. “They’ve got an Earth ecology 
farm there, and I was a caretaker. 
I studied botany in school on Earth, 
took an exam and was lucky enough 
to land this job. Well, it’s over 
now. Say, you going to eat?” 

“I suppose so.” 

Cullan slid off the stool. “We 
can get a table right here. I’ve 
heard of a couple of Boklan dish- 
es I want to try. Okay?” 

“Okay. Sure.” 

T om let CuUan’s offhanded breez- 
iness carry the conversation. It 
wasn’t absorbing, in his present state 
of mind, but it wasn’t bothersome 
either. 

The food was good. They had 
two more drinks apiece after the 



meal. Finally, Tom got a little tired 
of the chatter. “Do you mind if 
we call it a night? I’m pretty tired.” 

Cullan looked at his watch. “So 
am I. Are you keeping Marob 
time?” 

“I guess so. As long os the ship 
does.” 

“Well, maybe you’ll join us at 
breakfast? There’s a group of six 
of us, all English-speaking, who’ve 
gotten together, in a restaurant 
where they’ve got a supply of some- 
thing very much like hen’s eggs. 
I’ve taught them how to scramble 
them.” 

Tom got up. “Maybe I’ll see you.” 

He lay awake a long time, think- 
ing. Then, unable to stand the 
doubt, he turned on a light and 
got up to examine the passport. It 
did him no good, of course. He 
went back to bed. 

What had happened to Wioon? 
The newscasts, of course, were cen- 
sored. Probably, he thought, the 
Fists had tried to interrogate the 
tycoon, and he’d taken the hard 
way out. But that would imply a 
bigger thing than Tom’s passport. 
So would Daal’s martyrdom at the 
spaceport, and the Elite police- 
man’s. 

Diat latter opened up a new 
path of thought. If an Elite police- 
man had been working with Wioon, 
there might be more of them. There 
might be a whole underground, with 
Wioon a link. Certainly, there were 
rumors enough flying around 
Merob; and the Fists were very 
nervous. 

If so, Tom wouldn’t have blam- 
ed Wioon a particle. It was a bitter

thought that the jovial tycoon might 
have been tripp^ up merely be- 
cause he’d gone out of his way to 
help Tom. Well, it was over and 
done now. All Tom could do was 
try to get to Paib Salang. 

He’d stood solitude in the past 
easily enough; now he found it very 
uncomfortable. He decided he’d 
join Cullan’s group for breakfast. 
Somehow, eventually, he slept.

66y^ver here!” Cullan waved to 
him from a table. By the 
time Tom got there, the blond man 
had a space cleared for him. “This 
is Santos Yberra, folks. Santos, Mr. 
and Mrs. Frank Ludlow; Jim Cres- 
mer; Hal Oakley; Bud Vollander. 
I was telling Santos last night — if 
we could get all thirty of the hu- 
mans aboard together, we could or- 
ganize a society. Human Exiles 
From Merob.” 

Vollander was a thickset, dark 
man of middle age, with a Teutonic 
accent. He frowned. “That is not 
a subject for jokes, after Vreyol 
Kwayr 

Cullan looked startled, then em- 
barrassed. “I forgot. Sorry. Well . 
the six of us here were hoping to 
get the same ship off Zenner. How 
about you, Santos? Going straight 
on to Earth?” 

Tom hesitated. “Well, maybe. But 
you know there’s no direct passage.” 

Cresmer — sandy-haired, lanky 
— looked up. “You sure of that? 
The crewman I asked didn’t know.” 

Tom said, “Why, any of the of- 
ficial guides can get you complete 



schedules. You’d have to go to 
Vreyol; that’s the closest.” 

Cullan stepped into the pause. 
“Santos is in shipping. He can prob- 
ably tell you every route, fares 
and all.” 

Tom suppressed annoyance. 
“Well, I’m not exactly in shipping. 
But I’ve read over a lot of sched- 
ules.” 

Ludlow said, “If we were sure 
Vreyol wouldn’t go Fist, Edna and 
I might stop there, if we have to 
go anyway. It’s . well, we said 
good-bye to all our friends and 
relatives on Earth and turned 
everything into cash.” He and his 
wife were in their thirties, Tom 
judged. They sounded Australian. 

Cullan gave a cheer. “Here come 
the eggs!” He motioned the waiter 
to set the tray beside him and 
seized a fork. “Let me have your 
plate, Edna. There! Somebody pass 
this toast around. Almost like home, 
eh? Tom, you’ve got to try some of 
this aspic!” 

Oakley, a slight man who looked 
Eurasian, was looking at the ring 
Tom wore. “How did you get that 
off Merob, Mr. Yberraf ’ 

Tom drew his hand back invol- 
untarily. “It’s Earth manufacture, so 
it was exempt.” 

Cullan was peering at the ring 
with interest. “Let me see it, will 
you?” 

Hesitantly, Tom pulled it off and 
handed it over. Cullan frowned at 
the stone. “S. Y. Your initials. So 
you hauled that big thing all the 
way from Earth, and now you’re 
hauling it back again. Is it a real 
ruby? It’s big.”

IF 




“A cheap one,” Tom improvised. 
Cullan handed it back again. 
“Nice ring. It’s a wonder they 
didn’t pass a special act and appro- 
priate it. Say — as long as we’re 
all interested in transportation off 
Zenner, why don’t we discuss it 
at breakfast tomorrow? I’ll get all 
the schedules from the travel of- 
fice, and Santos will know which 
lines might have food we can stand, 
and things. Okay, Santos?” 

Tom answered abstractedly. He’d 
just become aware of a ship’s offi- 
cer standing just inside the door, 
looking at him. “All right. Will 
you excuse me for a minute? I 
think I’m being paged.” 

H weki was as neatly-uniformed 
as before. He directed his muz- 
zle at Tom for a moment before 
speaking. “Forgive my bothering you 
again, but I must ask questions. Will 
you give me a resume of your move- 
ments since leaving this office yes- 
terday?” 

Tom tried to read something in 
the steady eyes. He failed. “Why, 
from here I went to a lounge not far 
away. I met another Terran, and we 
had dinner together. Then I went to 
my stateroom and was there until 
breakfast time, where your guide 
found me.” 

Hweki appeared to sigh. “That 
was all? You went nowhere else, 
spoke to no one?” 

“Only the bartender and waiter.” 
“And this other Terran — it 
was Renfrew Cullan, I know. Was 
he in the lounge when you got 
there?” 

“I assume so. Where I sat at the 



bar I was facing the door, and I 
think I’d have seen him come. in. 
He approached me very soon after 
I got there. I suppose he’d been 
at a table in the dark end of the 
room.” 

This time Hweki definitely sigh- 
ed. “I was hoping you could add 
something. The bartender places 
you both, within a few minutes. And 
we know you didn’t leave your 
stateroom during the night. Well, so 
much for that, yes? Another mat- 
ter. You say you applied to Wioon 
Lek, Chartered. Did you happen 
to meet another Terran who work- 
ed for them? His name was Thomas 
Larrow.” 

Tom hoped he could lie with 
a straight face. “Larrow? No, I 
met very few Terrans on Merob.” 

Hweki stared thoughtfully along 
his muzzle. “I am going to tell 
you some things, in the hope some- 
thing may occur to you. Please un- 
derstand that the Line, and my 
Government, are neutral in Meroban 
politics. But we maintain sources 
of information. Before we got com- 
pletely out of radio range, I learn- 
ed certain things. First, Wioon Lek 
was involved in a conspiracy that 
included the sabotage of Vreyol 
KwayJ* 

Tom’s face must have showed his 
shock. 

The Bokl went on, “This Thomas 
Larrow had passage aboard Vreyol 
Kway. Since he had living quarters 
on the Wioon Lek compound, we 
speculate that the tools of sabotage 
may have been smuggled aboard in 
his luggage, with or without his 
knowledge. I am not familiar

enough with humans to know 
whether you are willing martyrs. 
Can you say?” 

Tom tried his voice and found it 
worked, more or less. “Martyrs .... 
It would depend on the individual 
and the cause. I would say, if this 
— this Larrow blew himself up 
with the ship, he was an unusual 
man. A fanatic.” 

Hweki inclined his head. “Thank 
you. He could have been deceived 
in some way, of course.” 

Tom could not help protesting, 
“But Wioon Lek — from what I 
heard, he was a benevolent sort! 
How could he — ?” 

Hweki regarded him thoughtfully. 
“Yes; ordinarily. A fine civilized 
person. But it seems there was a 
great deal at stake. No less than 
the secret of the Elite weapon.” 
Tom sat newly dumfounded. Sud- 
denly, the ring on his left hand 
seemed to weigh tons. Finally, in 
near panic, he said hoarsely, “But 
wouldn’t that argue against the sab- 
otage of Vreyol KwayV 

“Well, no,” Hweki said slowly. 
“There is more. I’ve been a little 
oblique with you. Your own alibi 
is sound in what I’m about to tell 
you, but there’s the question of 
your passport. I have to consider 
you as possibly connected. Maybe 
without knowing it. You see, short- 
ly after Ussmed left this office — 
sometime while you were in the 
lounge — he was murdered in bis 
stateroom.” 

T om sat in his own stateroom, 
with a single light on. He’d 
have to examine the ring presently, 



of course, but he wasn’t quite sure 
there wouldn’t be a hidden camera 
somewhere. If there was, he daren’t 
reveal his state of mind by making 
a search. Finally he decided to go 
into the kitchenette. If Hweki did 
catch him, at least the ling might 
not fall into the hands of the Mero- 
ban Government. 

He had no magnifying glass. How- 
ever, holding the ring close to a 
strong light, he could see faint signs 
of the joint between the real gem 
and the plastic overlay. He peered 
at the inside of the band. How much 
information could be stored in a 
finger-ring? Messages could be mag- 
netically recorded in the metal, of 
course. But maybe even that wasn’t 
necessary. The shape of the ring it- 
self — the makeup of the alloy, 
even, or the cut of the stone — 
might reveal, to one who knew the 
code, some location, the name of 
some individual, who held the secret. 

He couldn’t feel angry with Wi- 
oon. The industrialist had unhesi- 
tatingly laid his own life on the 
line. And, in doing all he could 
to protect the ring, he’d been also 
protecting Tom. 

It was clear now that the whole 
thing had been staged, prepared 
ahead of time. “Santos Yberra” was 
a false name. Whoever had gotten 
the passport in that name, of 
course, was working for Wioon. 
Naturally it was from Vreyol, and 
unaltered — the byplay with Daal 
had been to make the thing more 
convincing to Tom. Not Daal’s 
death, though. That had obviously 
been some hitch in the plans. But 
Daal hadn’t hesitated either.

IF 




So someone ihad gone aboard 
Vreyol Kway using Tom’s Meroban 
passport and ticket^ to do the sab- 
otage. 

Suddenly Tom remember the 
newscast. A trashboat had left Vre- 
yol Kway shortly before the explo- 
sion. 

He jammed the ring back on his 
finger and began pacing the kitchen- 
ette. 

Maybe the sabotage hadn’t been 
a suicide mission! The crew had 
been arrested. But maybe a stow- 
away had been found, too — and 
maybe Wioon Lek’s involvement 
had been wrung out of the stow- 
away. It was possible to ride in the 
hold of a trashboat; they were pres- 
surized and insulated (because they 
doubled as supply boats and even 
personnel carriers at times. Actually, 
the “trash” they carried down from 
an orbitting liner wasn’t garbage, 
or waste paper, or anything like 
that. Those things, a liner reworked 
and regenerated again and again, 
because it was cheaper than de- 
celerating them out of orbit. The 
“trash” was a final unusable resi- 
due: silicates, carbides and such. In 
the case of Meroban and Vreyolan 
ships, it was a coarse dust. Treaty, 
as well as tragic experience, for- 
bade dumping it in orbit, or even in 
nearby space. 

It would be landed. Boklan 
ships, he knew, went even fur- 
ther. They fused the residue into 
porous bricks, which could be used 
for building. But even in Vreyol 
Kway's dust-load, a person could 
hide and escape a ship if he were 
very clever and very daring. 



If the saboteur had done that, 
and been caught, there was no mys- 
tery about Wioon Lek’s death. Tlie 
Fists had tried to arrest him or in- 
terrogate him in his own office, and 
he’d killed himself. 

A coward in Tom’s situation, Tom 
mused, would go to Hweki, tell the 
whole thing and beg for sanctuary, 
even if it were a Boklan prison. A 
coward might even persuade himself 
that he possibly didn’t carry the 
message after all. He could be 
merely a decoy, another layer of 
security in Wioon’s laminated plan. 
It looked as if that plan were oper- 
ating aboard Obolis, If not, then why 
was the murder of Ussmed neces- 
sary? 

Slowly a thought formed in his 
mind. If the saboteur had escaped 
in a trashboat, maybe Tom could 
do the same thing. If the same mis- 
fortune — arrest — waited him on 
the planet, at least it would be by 
Bokla, not Fists. And if he got away 
to Paib Salang, the ring would be 
safe, possibly, from the Fists on 
Zenner; and Tom might get to Earth 
after all. 

For all he knew, a hundred pas- 
sengers on Obolis might be either 
after him or protecting him right 
now. In the hours that remained be- 
fore his deadline, he might learn 
who some of them were. And he had 
to get a look at the ship’s trash- 
boats. Then he could start planning 
an escape. 

Seeing the trashboats and how 
they were handled would be easy. 
He’d simply go on one of the con- 
ducted tours of the ship; that way 
there’d be no suspicion.

^ Tour Twenty-Eight 

VV please board its car? Tour 
Twenty-Eight.” 

The junior officer guiding was as 
neat as a fresh pastry in his white 
uniform as he stood beside the 
door of the cigar-shaped vehicle, 
looking courteous. Behind the car, 
the slot in the transportation tube 
waited to gulp it in. 

Tom glanced back once more at 
the huge vistawall with its live pic- 
ture of Central Control. They’d 
stood there for fifteen minutes while 
the guide pointed things out and 
answered questions. Tom would 
have welcomed more time. There 
were things he might learn from 
that picture about ship’s operations. 
For one thing, Central Control was 
obviously kept on low gravity — 
tiny Boklan figures wafted about 
the picture on their harness gravs. 

But next they were going aft, 
where he’d see the trashboats. He 
boarded the car and found a seat. 
They slid sideways into the tube, 
then there were brief mild sensa- 
tions of acceleration and decelera- 
tion — unnecessary, but faked to 
preserve the sense of orientation — 
and the door slid open again. He 
got out in his turn and stood half 
listening to the guide. The chamber 
here, he judged, was eighty yards 
long and half that diameter. It was 
cylindrical — actually the aft end 
of the ship’s inmost core, enclosed 
by Superwall D. The chamber was 
dark except for lights near the tour 
party. 

The trashboat they were looking 



at, a blunt vehicle about fifty feet 
long, rested on and was clamped to 
a pair of rails leading from the 
inner bulkhead behind it to the 
aft one, along the side of the cylin- 
der. There were eight such pairs 
of rails spaced around the cylinder, 
each leading to a circular door in 
the aft bulkhead. The lights were 
dim there, Tom guessed, so the other 
boats apparently hanging overhead 
wouldn’t be too disturbing. Grav 
here was radially outward, so that 
one could walk clear around the 
curve without feeling any change. 

A Meroban was asking, “Are 
those single-stage airlocks at the end 
there?” The party turned to look 
at the circular doors. 

“No, sir,” the guide said, “they 
are three-stage locks. The ends of 
the ship have four Superwalls too. 
Everything is built to the principle 
of extra safety.” 

Tom 'had edged around the trash- 
boat and was examining the stack 
of residue-^bricks on a pallet beside 
the open hatch. Each was about 
thirty inches long, half that wide 
and a fourth that thick, so they made 
an interstaggered pile on the pallet. 
He visualized the layers. Yes, it 
would be possible, given time, to 
rebuild the stack with a hollow in- 
side, big enough for a man. But 
would he run out of oxygen? The 
bricks were porous, but there’d be 
little circulation through or between 
them. Besides, he’d be immobolized. 
The Vreyolan residue of dust would 
be easier to hide in, if a man had 
a pressure suit or even a helmet and 
air supply. 

He moved to where he could 



78 



IF 





A TICKET TO ZENNER 



79 



look into the boat’s hold. There 
was part of load still on pallets in- 
side. They’d been loaded aboard 
with a fork truck, then, or some- 
thing like it. The pallets rested on 
a temporary deck, to which the load 
was lashed by cargo nets. But from 
the overhead, limp ply-fabric hung. 
Those were airbags that would be 
inflated to keep the load more 
secure. Would they bulge down too 
far at the sides? No; between the 
pallet-loads and the curved bulk- 
heads, there was space they wouldn’t 
fill. 

He examined the hatch-edges 
carefully to make sure the pressure 
seal was all right. He didn’t want 
to breath space if he rode this par- 
ticular boat down. He peered in 
and forward, but the hold was too 
dark for him to see the doorway 
into the crew compartment. Surely 
there’d be one. 

He was excited with the idea now. 
He rejoined the group and listened 
te whatever the guide had to say 
about this part of the ship. From 
here, they’d go to one more place 
— a hydroponics compartment — 
then they’d have ship’s-courtesy re- 
freshments. After that, it wouldn’t 
be long to TL. 

Uj ast call. All passengers should 

J— / be within Superwall B. Trans- 
location in four minutes.” 

Of the breakfast group, only Edna 
Ludlow showed any nervousness. 
“Oh, dear. I wish I’d stayed in the 
stateroom.” 

Her husband grinned. Bud Vollan- 
der looked at her more seriously. 
“You’re within Superwall C here. 



Not that there’s any danger worth 
calculating.” 

Renfrew Cullan signalled the 
waiter for more beverage, then 
smiled at Tom. “You’re the ex- 
pert, Santos. Just what are chances?” 
Tom, annoyed, said, “I’m not an 
expert. As I understand it, before 
translocation these Boklan ships send 
a small sensor-drone through, pack- 
ed with instruments. In the very un- 
likely event that the target area 
contains any solid matter as big as 
a pinhead the drone will find it. The 
drone comes back and reports auto- 
matically, and if everything’s clear 
the ship translocates. TTie only thing 
that could go wrong is that some 
object could be moving into the 
target area at a respectable fraction 
of light-speed. That doesn’t occur 
naturally, of course.” 

Ednal insisted, “But what if some 
other ship . .” 

Tom said, “Well, you wouldn’t 
have time to realize what was hap- 
pening. But the chances compare to 
this: suppose two people on two 
ships a million miles apart were 
firing rifles into space, deliberately 
aiming away from each other. Even 
if both made a mistake, or went 
insane, or something, the chances 
of two bullets colliding head-on 
would be pretty small. Do you see?” 
Edna smiled. “It does sound 
small.” 

Jim Cresmer was watching a 
chronometer. “Here it comes.” 

The P. A. system said, ‘Trans- 
location in four seconds.” Tom tried 
not to hold his breath. There was 
a ping, then an almost impercepti- 
ble shudder of the room. A minute

went by; two; a fraction of a third. 
The voice said, “Translocation com- 
pleted. Zenner’s sun is in easy tele- 
scope range.” 

Tom wondered if the others at 
the table were silent because they 
felt as he did — a little frightened; 
uncertain; not knowing whether the 
vague sense of tremendous distances 
gone, of eons lost, were imagina- 
tion or not. Or the very faint vis- 
ualizations that flashed into the mind 
were gone — beauties too wonderful 
to grasp; horrors beyond dreaming. 
In any case, the feeling went away 
fast. 

OuUan said, “Well, halfway. What 
are you going to do the rest of the 
trip, Santos? You don’t seem to be 
interested in cards or anything.” 
Tom already had an idea that 
might camouflage his escape. “I’m 
going to study the ship’s hydro- 
ponics, if they’ll let me. They’re way 
beyond anything Earth knows, or 
Merob or Vreyol for that matter. I 
may be able to turn the study into 
money when I get home.” 

eal dirt?” Cullan asked Tom 
-tv in surprise. They and a jun- 
ior ship’s officer were outside Super- 
wall B. “I didn’t know that! ^%y 
aren’t they hydroponics like the 
others we’ve seen?” 

The guide explained, “It is not 
ordinary dirt that you would find 
on a planet, sir. Most of it is a 
metal compound for absorbing hard 
radiation. As long as we need a 
layer of it anyway we put it in 
granular form, mix in plant nutrients 
and make it do double duty, yes?” 
Tom stared aroun4 the vast com- 



partment. It was like the size of 
a football field. From where they 
stood, a long walkway led through 
the virtual jungle to the far end 
and on into the next compartment. 
Practically all of Superwall B was 
layered with this. “Are any edibles 
grown out here?” 

No, sir. Well, except for a few 
private plots the crew maintains. 
The edibles aren’t as radiation- 
resistant as these trees. Of course, 
it’s seldom we have to take hard 
radiation.” 

Tom nodded. “How about oxy- 
gen? There must be a lot releas^ 
out here. Do you use it?” 

“Yes, sir, normally. But if it at 
all doubtful, the inner hydroponics 
can yield plenty. Not to mention the 
stored reserves. The safety factor is 
about six to one, yes?” 

Tom said, “I certainly appre- 
ciate your throwing all this open 
to me. You won’t have to worry 
about Earth competition for a while, 
though. It’d be generations before 
we can work up anything like this.” 
The Bokl looked pleasant. “We 
do not worry about competition, pas- 
senger Yberra. The galaxy is very 
big, and space societies few in com- 
parison.” 

Later Tom lay in bed, wondering 
how Hweki was assessing his inter- 
est in the greenery. Once again he 
resisted the urge to turn on a light 
and look at the clock. When he’d 
slept, if he could, the roomlights 
went on for morning, he’d still have 
plenty of time. 

The actual timing would have 
to be a guess, of course. He couldn’t 
estimate within ten hours when

81 




they’d be in radio range. Nor could 
he know what the information from 
Vreyol might be, or what Hweki 
would do. 

There were two reasons he must 
wait as long as he dared. First, be- 
cause the sooner he disappeared, the 
more time they’d have to look for 
him. He hoped they’d spend it 
searching the greenery for him or 
his corpse. Second, it was going to 
be a long ordeal in the trashboat. 
A man might go insane. 

He rolled over restlessly and re- 
shaped the pillow. Maybe, instead 
of trying to sleep, he ought to lie 
here and practice patience. “Damn,” 
he muttered, “I’ve made up my 
mind. Why can’t I simply relax un- 
til it’s time?” But he couldn’t. 

VI 

R enfrew Cullan dished up scram- 
bled eggs. “I wonder what kind 
of hotel we’ll have on Zenner. I 
hope we’ll find a chef who can at 
least speak Meroban.” 

Edna Ludlow said, “It’ll be in 
the Meroban settlement, won’t it? 
Surely they won’t put us where we 
can’t make ourselves understood!” 
All of them looked at Tom. An- 
noyed, he said, “It’ll be the Boklan 
hotel at the spaceport, probably. The 
staff will speak Meroban and a doz- 
en other languages.” 

Bud Vollander said, “Yes, they 
have a fine hotel on Merob. And 
we don’t know the political situa- 
tion in the Meroban sector of Zen- 
ner.” 

Cullan asked Tom, “What do you 
think?” 



Tom tried to control his irritation. 
“I only* heard the same things the 
rest of you did. You know, of 
course, that the Bokla keep plane- 
tary control. Any local police have 
to clear with them. The Meroban 
Embassy will be Fist, but I doubt 
if the rest of the sector will. Maybe 
it’ll be split.” 

Edna said, “Well, anyway, I don’t 
want to stay there. I wish we didn’t 
even have to go ^ to Vreyol. I’d 
rather even have to learn some 
other language.” 

Tom couldn’t stand any more. He 
pushed back his chair. “Look; I’m 
afraid I’ll have to excuse myself. 
There’s a chemist I want to talk to. 
see you at lunch, okay?” 

He took the shortest route to his 
stateroom. It was several hours be- 
fore the time he’d planned; but 
nothing could be worse than this 
tension. He hurriedly filled plastic 
bags with water and the most con- 
centrated rations in the refrigera- 
tor, sealed them, arranged them on 
a cord to tie around his waist. Over 
it he donned his loosest coverall- 
suit and added a weather jacket 
so his waistline wouldn’t attract at- 
tention. He made a call and ar- 
ranged an appointment in one of 
the labs. Then, shaky with excite- 
ment, he left the stateroom . 
still clutching the jackphone in his 
hand. Angrily he stuffed it into a 
pocket. 

Avoiding the traveled corridors, 
he got to the transfer point with 
the huge vistawall. There were still 
tours coming and going. He edged 
around until one was there that in- 
cluded four humans.

IF 




When it left, he slipped into the 
car with it and took a seat at the 
rear. Several times the guide looked 
in his direction, but showed no 
sign of knowing he had an extra 
passenger. 

At the aft chamber Tom waited 
his chance, then slipped beyond the 
same trashboat. The load was big- 
ger now, but there was still more 
to come. He looked around ner- 
vously, saw no crewmen, and hastily 
climbed aboard. Once behind the 
load, he stood a moment breathing 
deeply in relief. Then he hunted 
for a small dark space against the 
off bulkhead. He chose one and 
squirmed himself into it; crawled a 
few feet and found a slightly wider 
spot. He began unloading his emer- 
gency rations. Now the ordeal was 
begun. 

He’d brought along tranquilizers, 
but he daren’t use them yet; he must 
be alert. After a while he looked at 
his watch. Five minutes had passed. 
One five-^hundredth, possibly, of the 
period he’d have to endure. Now 
that he was here, he felt very foolish; 
but he was committed. 

Most immediately, he worried 
about the appointment he’d broken. 
He hoped the chemist wouldn’t re- 
port it to Ship’s Security too soon. 

U tter inactivity was a new ex- 
perience. As a young man he’d 
been an athlete; then there’d been 
study, girls, and whatnot. After col- 
lege he’d gotten on with an Earth 
firm pioneering into space. That 
had been merely within the Solar 
System, then; but alien contacts were 
growing, and all the ybung men 



wanted to head Out. After a couple 
of years Tom got his break with 
Wioon Lek, Chartered, just then 
establishing warehouses and offices 
on Earth. They’d needed a few Ter- 
ran employees off-planet. And 
Wioon seemed to have taken a per- 
sonal liking to Tom. It had been 
a pretty wonderful day when Tom 
boarded a Meroban ship. 

If he’d thought the old job on 
Earth was boring, he should have 
had a foretaste of this. He tried to 
relax, squirmed and tried to relax 
again. He sipped water and chewed 
a little dried meat. He looked at 
his watch so often that finally he 
took it off and put it in a pocket. 

Six hours passed somehow. 

Suddenly there was stronger 
light. He lay still, pulse pounding 
audibly. Presently there were sounds 
he recognized as the whole cham- 
ber coming to life — the rumble 
of boats on rails, the whine of fork- 
trucks, Boklan voices. Final load- 
ing had begun. 

It startled him when there were 
noises close by, followed by a jar. 
But it was only another pallet load 
of bricks coming aboard. The ones 
next to him relayed the impulse, 
and he wondered fleetingly if they’d 
be shoved in, crushing him, but 
they weren’t. He remembered they 
were already lashed down. More 
pallets came aboard and were ma- 
neuvered into place. Then, finally, 
a hissing came from overhead. He 
saw the airbags swell and touch 
the top of the load, fit themselves 
around it, press down at the sides. 
But they stopped when there was 
still room for him to stand up.

After that the hatch was closed, 
and he heard it seal. There were 
sounds forward in the pilot com- 
partment now, and someone entered 
the crew compartment to open the 
door to the hold and shut it, making 
sure it was latched. Then the 
sounds subsided. It wasn’t complete- 
ly dark, as he’d expected. There 
were glowlamps in the hold some- 
where. 

He took a trank, but it didn’t 
seem to affect him. He lay listening 
to the sounds and squirming from 
one uncomfortable position to an- 
other. After a while, angry at his 
stupidity, he realized there was no 
reason he shouldn’t sit up. He was 
as jerky and full of improbable fears 
now as an old maid. He took another 
trank. 

When ten hours had passed, he 
knew they were within radio 
range of 2^nner. Now, if not 
before, Hweki would be looking for 
him. About that time he realized 
that part of his discomfort was the 
need to urinate. He hesitated a 
while, then got out one of the extra 
plastic bags he’d brought and took 
care of the need. After that the re- 
lief was so great he could sit and 
relax a little. 

Time seemed to lose its sequence 
now. Memories and apprehensions 
somehow got mixed up. His head 
jerked up with a snap, and he realiz- 
ed he’d dozed. Well, that was fine. 
He lay down again. Absently he 
rubbed his fingers over the bricks 
beside him. They’d make a good 
building wall; with a strong mortar 
they might not need reinforcement. 
And the insulation would be very 



good. He wondered how much of 
the cost of compressing and fus- 
ing the dust was offset by the sell- 
ing price. That was the factor. Dust 
or bricks, the deceleration out of 
orbit would be the same. 

Time dragged on, dislocated or 
not. Now and then he wondered 
if he were going insane. He vacil- 
lated from periods of comfortable 
dozing to tense, almost unbearable 
worry. He didn’t think he could have 
made it without the tranks. He 
looked at his watch — somehow 
he’d forgotten to do that for a long 
time — and was astounded how 
much time had elapsed. But why 
hadn’t they left the ship? He got 
to his feet in panic. 

It must have been an hour after 
that when he began to hear air 
whistling outside the hull. They must 
have left the ship while he was 
dozing. In sudden haste, he began 
collecting his things and shrugged 
back into the jacket. But he had 
plenty of time. He was all ready 
fifteen minutes before the boat 
touched down. 

H e’d reconciled himself to having, 
possibly, to wait for dark. What 
puzzled him was the lack of activi- 
ty outside the boat. The crew had 
left, audibly, and there were only 
faint distant sounds. The hold was 
still sealed. 

Finally he squeezed his way for- 
ward to the door. He put his ear 
against it and heard nothing then, 
cautiously, turned the handle. The 
latch clicked open. He waited tense- 
ly, but heard nothing beyond. Slow- 
ly, he eased the door open. 



84 



IP 




The crew department and the pi- 
lot department beyond were dark. 
Evidently it was night. That might 
explain the lack of activity; the hold 
would stay sealed until some cus- 
tomer arrived with a truck, next 
day. He hurried forward and tried 
to see out the two small glass 
ports. 

All he saw was a wall, against 
which the nose of the ship was 
parked. He didn’t dare turn on a 
televiewer, of course. 

There was no use waiting any 
longer. He tried one of the side 
doors, found it unlocked and pushed 
it open. It was a short step down to 
the ground. With a quick look 
around, he scurried for the darkest 
nearby shadow. Those were at the 
rear of the building — a ware- 
house — where a high fence, cov- 
ered with large-leafed vine, ran. He 
got the impression there was a 
street beyond. 

He peered down the narrow alley 
between building and fence, then 
turned to look at the spaceport. He 
was on the quiet side. Beyond the 
mile^ide field were hangars and 
warehouses, some of them lighted, 
and parked boats. He could make 
out Boklans walking about. Beyond 
the low bufldings loomed a very 
large hotel. 

He hurried along back of the 
building until he saw a gate in the 
fence, paused to look and listen, 
then slipped to the gate. It was 
latched, but unlocked. A road came 
in here, and he could see that the 
town beyond was a suburb, more 
smalbbusiness then residential. He 
made sure the street was empty and 



walked along it toward a lighted 
avenue. 

On the avenue, male and female 
Bokla eyed him curiously as he 
walked under a light. No doubt he 
looked seedy. He walked until he 
met a Bokla less neat than the 
others, and approached him. “Ex- 
cuse me. Where is the Meroban 
sector?” 

The native probably understood 
only the word “Meroban.” He star- 
ed at Tom for a moment, then 
turned and pointed. 

VII 

A s Tom expected, the poorest 
part of the sector was away 
from the port. He found a cheap- 
looking hotel, but hesitated. He 
needed a razor, or some substitute. 
He walked to a sundry store and 
settled for a keen knife. To satisfy 
the proprietor’s doubts, he made 
shaving motions, which fascinated 
the Meroban. Then he went to the 
hotel. 

The clerk, too, was curious. “You 
speak excellent Meroban. You have 
just come from Merob, yes?” 

“A few days ago. With things as 
they are, I couldn’t be choosy about 
transportation. But I have money to 
pay for the room.” 

The clerk grinned. “In advance, 
of course. Four tals, with the bath.” 
Tom found the room and looked 
longingly at the bed. But he’d have 
to see Paib Salang tonight, if he 
could. He undressed, and first of all 
sponged off his clothes and hung 
them to dry. Then he essayed the 
chore of shaving with the knife and 



A TICKET TO ZENNER 



85 




common soap, and finally had a hot, 
very satisfying bath. When he dressed 
again, he looJced presentable — at 
least reasonably so. 

He fished in his pocket for the 
jackphone, then hesitated. Maybe 
he’d better not call from his room. 
He left, waving to the clerk, who 
blinked at his cleanness, and walked 
down the street to a snack shop 
where he ordered a meat sandwich 
and the equivalent of coffee. He car- 
ried them to a corner table, sat down 
and plugged the phone into the wall 
receptacle. He allowed himself a bite 
of sandwich and a gulp of beverage, 
then leaned close to the phone. “I 
wish to speak to Paib Salang, this 
sector. Collect.” 

There was a confirming ping, then 
an electronic hum. He waited tense- 
ly. Finally a voice said, “Paib Salang 
speaks. Who calls?” 

“Code Nine Four Seven.” 

A pause, then, “Are you in pri- 
vacy?” 

“Privacy enough.” 

“Man Tom! I thought you dead! 
There has been no word from Merob 
since Wioon died!” 

Tom said, “I have an heirloom 
he wanted you to deliver.” 

An indrawn breath. “Where are 
you?” 

Tom told him. 

Another pause. “Two blocks to 
your left as you face the port is 
Klindar Street. Turn up it toward 
the port. Four blocks along is my 
house, number eight twenty-nine. Do 
not let anyone see you enter the 
vestibule. Ring once, then twice, 
then once again. Can you start 
now?” 



K lindar was a fairly well lighted 
street thjit grew more prosper- 
ous as he went. At the corner be- 
fore his objective he paused, look- 
ing ahead. A solitary Meroban was 
ambling on a block beyond, in the 
other direction. He waited until it 
turned a corner. 

As he moved again a human 
voice whispered in English, “San- 
tos!” 

He whirled, eyes searching the 
shadows. Then he saw a hand ges- 
turing. “Over here! Quickly!” 

Angry and suspicious, he took a 
step that way, but stayed out of 
reach. “Cullan! What the devil are 
you doing here?” 

“Watching for you, of course! 
Quickly! Out of sight!” 

Tom moved into a shadow. “I’ve 
got an appointment!” 

“Keep your voice down. We knew 
you’d try to reach Paib Salang, so 
we staked out the neighborhood. 
Bud Vollander’s down the other 
way. Paib’s been in custody for a 
couple of days.” 

Tom stared at him. “I just talked 
to Paib.” 

“No, you didn’t. If you called 
there, some Fist officer talked to 
you.” As Tom hesitated, Cullan 
chuckled. “Doubt me, eh? Just 
watch the house for a minute. It’s 
the seventh one up, on the left.” 
Tom turned to look up the street. 
It was less than two minutes, he was 
sure, before he saw an aircar’s lights 
descending. The craft landed atop 
the house, and Meroban figures 
tumbled out to run toward the roof 
entrance. He made out Fist uni- 
forms.

“Come onl” Cullan urged. “The 
street will he swarming in a min- 
ute!** 

Dismayed, Tom went with him. 
Cullan led the way through what 
seemed to he a deserted basement, 
through the back yard, over a fence 
and through another yard grown 
with reedlike stuff. Somewhere, a 
domesticated animal yawped. An- 
other fence and a walkway beneath 
a lighted window, and they were in 
an alley. A block along that, Cullan 
turned down a dark street. “I’ve 
got a hotel room not far away. If 
we can make that we’ll be safe for 
a while. I’ve made arrangements to 
smuggle you out of town.” 

1 '^hey put on a drunk act as they 
went by the clerk. The room 
was on the second floor. Cullan 
closed the door behind them and 
set the lock, then turned to grin at 
Tom. “Whew. That was dose. I 
thought we’d lost you. I need a 
drink, if you don’t.” He went into 
the bathroom and emerged with a 
bottle and a glass. “Real Earthside 
bourbon!” He poured a stiff drink 
and offered it to Tom. When Tom 
hesitated, he laughed. “Still don’t 
trust me, eh? Well, I’ll drink first.” 
He drained the glass, refilled it and 
offered it to Tom again. 

Tom couldn’t see anything tricky 
about the glass or bottle, and he 
was beginning to be ashamed of 
his doubt. He took the drink and 
downed it. Cullan said, “Sit down; 
we’re all right for an hour or so. 
How the devil’d you get off Obolis?'* 
Toni told him, “I hid in a trash- 
boat.” 



Cullan laughed. “They searched 
all over Superwall B. You’re lucky 
you didn’t smother in the dust. We 
didn’t know what had happened. 
Thought you might be dead. And 
when we found Paib had been ar- 
rested, we almost gave up. The Fists 
must have had a lot on him, to 
convince the Bokla. Well, it’s okay 
now. I’ll phone down for some 
sandwiches.” He started toward a 
wall receptacle, drawing a jackphone 
from his pocket, then stopped and 
looked down at Tom’s left hand. 
“You didn’t lose the ring, I see.” 
“No. And I’ve already had a 
sandwich. But — ” 

He stopped. Suddenly he realized 
what Cullan had said. Dust Cullan 
had said. Dust, Cullan didn’t know 
about the Boklan residue bricks. 
But he knew about the Vreyolan 
dust residue. 

A terrible thought squirmed in 
Tom’s mind. He tried to control his 
face, tried not to stare. But — yes, 
with his hair dyed and skin stained, 
and with cheeks padded — and with 
contact lenses over his blue irises — 
Cullan could have posed for the 
picture of Santos Yberra. 

And he could be the saboteur. 
Maybe he’d ridden a trashboat down 
from Vreyol Kway, And maybe 
he, not the Fists, had gotten to 
Wioon Lek. A doublecross. 

Cullan was looking at him with 
concern. “Something wrong?” 

“Uh — just a little dizzy. It’ll 
pass.” Tom could feel, or imagine 
he felt, something working in his 
own blood. The whiskey. 

His mind raced. If he’d been 
doped, he’d have only a few min- 



88 



IF 




utes. If he could get CuHan’s at- 
tention off him for a moment . 

He pulled the ring off his finger 
and stepped forward, holding it out 
to Cullan. “Here. I’m damned glad 
to be rid of it.” 

Cullan’s control slipped just per- 
ceptibly. His face tightened as he 
stared at the ring; he reached out 
for it a little too greedily. Tom 
swung his left fist as hard as he 
could. 

Cullan reacted like a feline; jerked 
his head so the blow didn’t land 
squarely. He went down, but he 
wasn’t much stunned. His face was 
murderous now, and his hand was 
flashing up with a small weapon. 

Tom kicked him in the head, 
and he went limp. 

For a moment Tom leaned on 
a chair-back, feeling the onset of 
dizziness. Then he fumbled for his 
phone; mumbled into it, “Urgent. 
For Fourth Officer Hweki, ship 
Obolis, in orbit. Trace this call to 
the murderer. This is — this is — 
a false passport talking.” 

He plugged the phone in, then 
staggered out the door and down 
the hallway. He wanted to be 
around a turn, at least, if Cullan re- 
vived, or confederates came, before 
Hweki did. 

VIII 

W hen he revived he felt light- 
headed, but otherwise all 
right. Hweki was looking down at 
him gravely. 

Tom tried to sit up in bed and 
found he could. A second Boklan 
whose neat uniform was not medi- 



cal helped adjust pillows. The room 
was subtly alien: chairs low and 
short-seated, windows a trifle high. 
The first thing Tom said was, “You 
got him?” 

Hweki’s head inclined in affirm- 
ation. “You almost kicked too hard. 
It would have been a shame not to 
be able to interrogate him.” 

Tom relaxed against the pillows. 
“Did he sabotage Vreyol Kway? 
And try to interrogate Wioon?” 
“Yes. Wioon was too trusting of 
a hired desperado.” 

Tom asked, “What about his con- 
federates?” 

Hweki made a gesture of wonder. 
“He had none. The man is incredi- 
ble! He did it all by himself — all 
of it — Ussmed, and Paib; mean- 
while posing as Renfrow Cullan and 
various other people. He must have 
worked on split-second schedules. 
And the acting; and the deduction! 
And you should hear the audacity 
of his schemes for selling informa- 
tion, once he got it. He’d already 
made overtures to Vreyol and to 
several other races, including my 
own. My superiors thought they were 
getting feelers from a well organ- 
ized criminal cartel!” 

Tom thought about that a mo- 
ment, then asked puzzledly, “Paib, 
did you say? He killed Paib too?” 
“Of course. After interrogating 
him with drugs, as he did Ussmed. 
He didn’t have much luck with 
either. They didn’t know about the 
ring, or even for sure if you were 
carrying the secret. Actually, he 
could have given them information. 
When he saw the ring, he knew it 
was significant because of the ini-

tials on it. He, of all people, had 
reason to know you weren’t Santos 
Yberra.” 

Tom said, “But when he inter- 
cepted me near Paib’s house, the 
Fist police really were coming!” 

“Naturally. He’d phoned them 
they’d find Paib’s corpse. Another 
example of his quickness. And, for 
another — we estimate he had about 
fifteen minutes to scout the neigh- 
borhood, find a place to intercept 
you and reconnoiter a line of es- 
cape.” 

Tom sighed. “God. And he’d have 
fooled me too, except for one 
chance remark he made. What about 
the ring? What message does it 
carry?” 

Hweki said, “It carries the whole 
technology of the Elite weapon. The 
stone is artificial, built up layer by 
crystal layer. The pattern of impuri- 
ties in it carries the text, which can 
be read out by a special electron 
microscope. We solved it fairly fast. 
There is the equivalent of many 
books.” 

Tom looked at him. “What are 
you going to do with it?” 

“I think we will just keep it. 
Such a weapon is safer in our hands 
than in some.” 

Tom nodded slowly. “I agree. 
What about that whiskey he gave 
me? Why didn’t it affect him too?” 

“I presume,” the Security Offi- 
cer said, “he’d already swallowed 
an antidote.” 

Tom felt himself flush. “Of 
course. I was pretty stupid, wasn’t 
I? All the way. I was as lucky as 
he was smart. I guess I was even 
incredibly lucky to get down on the 



boat. If it hadn’t happened to park 
where it did, probably have been 
caught.” 

Hweki looked amused. “It wasn’t 
exactly luck; we arranged for it to 
park there, and we had you in sight 
most of the time you were in the 
open after that. But we lost you 
for a little while when Cullan spir- 
ited you away. That little while was 
almost too much.” 

Tom was staring at him. “You

you knew I was in the boat?” 

“Yes.” 

Tom thought about it, and was 
able to grin wryly. “A hell of an 
outlaw I would make.” 

“Oh, you did quite well, man 
Larrow. As a matter of fact. I’m 
going to offer you a job in my 
organization. With your race be- 
ginning to move into space, I need 
a human or two. But you will have 
to learn one basic principle, and 
this is an excellent lesson. You must 
consider your adversaries more 
thoroughly — not only their mental- 
ities, but their physiology as well.” 

'^p'om lay stunned for. a minute. 

A “A — a job, in space? I — I’m 
very grateful! I guess I didn’t really 
want to go back to Earth anyway. 
Not permanently. But what did I 
overlook?” 

“Think, man Larrow. You hid 
well from our eyes. But we are 
not evolved from the same kind of 
animal as you are. I know that on 
Earth you have certain animals with 
long muzzles.” 

Tom felt his face growing very 
red. “You . smelled me?”

The Purpose of Fandom 

by LIN CARTER 

Our tAar\ in Fandom gives 
us a fan's-eye view of the 
field and some graduates 



T o begin with, there is no pur- 
pose to fandom. None at all. 
It’s just a hobby . something 
you’re in for fun. But the fact you’re 
a fan means something, in a way. 
It means that your interest in sci- 
ence fiction is more than whim deep. 
You read science fiction — not 
casually, when you stumble across 
a paperback or a magazine by 
chance — but avidly: you seek it 
out and collect it. For this reason, 
sf means more to you than just 
“something to read.” 

There are lots of folks who read, 
say, mysteries, or historicals, or 
westerns. But who would think of 
collecting them? What for? — they 
aren’t that deeply interested in them. 
But there’s something about science 
fiction, some indefinable element or 
ingredient that makes its readers 
fiercely partisan. They love it; they 
want to share it with others, to con- 
vert their friends to sf. Science fic- 
tion is the only form of popular 



literature I know that imbues its 
readers with the urge to proselytize. 
Oh, I don’t mean to suggest that 
every single last individual who ever 
picked up a single copy of Gory 
Rocketship Thrillbook was auto- 
matically transmogrified into a wild- 
eyed sf fan, committed for life to 
his hobby. But an awful lot of us 
were .... 

Fan Into Pro 

I like to think that those of us 
who love science fiction and fantasy 
tend generally to be more imagina- 
tive and, potentially at least, more 
creative people than the norm. At 
any rate (and I won’t pause to de- 
bate the point, which is pretty du- 
bious), there definitely is a very 
strong and ever-present tendency for 
science-fiction readers to become 
science-fiction writers. Again, I 
know of no other branch or school 
of pop fiction in which this is de- 



92 



monstrably true. Very few sf writers 
come from The Outside World; most 
all of them rise up from the fan 
ranks. Now, this just doesn’t happen 
in other forms of fiction: writers, 
real professionals, turn to cranking 
out mysteries or gothic romances or 
comic-book continuity or westerns 
or historicals because it’s a fast, easy 
buck. Not because they love the 
field. 

In a very real and true way, I 
think it could be stated that this is 
the “purpose” of fandom. Fandom 
is a proving ground from which the 
professionals of tomorrow are (as it 
were) launched. This “purpose” was 
not in anyone’s mind when the first 
attempts to organize fandom were 
made. It just happened. And here are 
some exciting examples. 

Editors and Publishers 

If you are one of those nice peo- 
ple who read this column every 
month, you already know my his- 
tory-maldng first example of fan- 
into-pro. A few columns back, I 
told you the amazing experience of 
the first lucky chap ever to realize 
every fan’s dearest dream: Charles 
D. Hornig, the 17-year-old sf fan 
from Jersey City who was picked 
out of nowhere to become editor of 
a real professional science-fiction 
magazine. Wonder Stories, 

When this incredible break hap- 
pened to Hornig, it shook the fan- 
dom of the day considerably. But 
it wasn’t long until the same sort of 
thing was happening to other fans, 
and it is still going on today. Let’s 
see ... 



There was Raymond A. Palmer. 
Palmer was one of the very earliest 
fans, and he helped organize one of 
the first proto-fanclubs, the Science 
Correspondence Club, about 1930. 
He was active in early fanclubs, con- 
tributed to and help^ edit fanzines 
and so on and, somehow or other, 
eventually ended up at Ziff-Davis 
as editor of Amazing Stories, He 
founded Fantastic Adventures later 
and, later yet, left Ziff-Davis to 
found some new magazines such as 
Other Worlds and Imagination and 
the occultist magazine Fate^ which 
is still going. 

Then there was William Law- 
rence Hamling, a Chicago fan who 
joined the fan ranks sometime about 
1939. Hamling was a prominent 
member of the Chicago chapter of 
the great Science Fiction League. He 
became one of Palmer’s associates 
on Other Worlds and succeeded him 
when Palmer left the magazine. 
Hamling foimded the short-lived 
Imaginative Tales and went on to 
build a truly fantastic publishing em- 
pire when he founded the early 
Playboy imitation Rogue and or- 
ganized Regency Books as their 
publisher (Regency editors who 
worked for him were, by odd coin- 
cidence, all one-time sf fans like 
Algis Budrys, Harlan Ellison and 
Larry Shaw). Today, Hamling pub- 
lishes Corinth Books out of San 
Diego. 

When Ray Palmer was editing 
Amazing Stories he bought some 
of the first stories of another old- 
time sf fan, Chester S. Geier. Geier 
was one of Palmer’s most popular 
and prolific writers, and, by an-

other of those peculiar coincidences 
that fill the history of sf fandom 
and make it so interesting, he fol- 
lowed in Palmer’s footsteps, and 
to this day he is editor of Fate 
Magazine, 

The Prophet of Ghu 

Another early fan was Donald 
A. WoUheim, easily one of the 
most active, important and famous 
men in fannish history, and perhaps 
the one who had the strongest in- 
fluence on the shape and institutions 
of fandom today. Wollheim was the 
founder and first president of PAPA 
(the Fantasy Amateur Press Asso- 
ciation). And the founder of the 
first just-for-fun fannish pseudore- 
“slan shack.” And inventor of the 
first just-for-fun fannish pseudo re- 
ligion, ghughuism. 

Wollheim also invented the idea 
of holding world science-fiction con- 
ventions. At a speech given in 1939 
at the first Eastern SF Convention 
in Long Island City, Wollheim pro- 
posed holding a world convention 
the following year in New York 
City, a suggestion enthusiastically 
endorsed by convention attendees 
who nominated him chairman of the 
historic 1939 Nycon I. 

Don Wollheim started founding 
and editing science-fiction magazines 
in 1941, with Stirring Science Sto- 
ries, Stirring has at least one dis- 
tinction: a copy of this now-for- 
gotten magazine was the deciding 
factor that turned young reader 
Philip K. Dick into a dedicated sf 
reader many, many years before 
he blossomed into an sf writer, au- 



thor of (among a dozen other 
books) the famous novel The Man 
in the High Castle. 

D.A.W. also founded the short- 
lived Cosmic Stories and, when he 
joined the Avon Book Company in 
1947, became the first ex-fan paper- 
back editor. Wollheim edited the 
first paperback sf anthology in his- 
tory, The Pocketbook of Science 
Fiction (1943) and the first hard- 
cover sf anthology of all. The Viking 
Portable Novels of Science (1945). 
And he founded another short-lived 
mag, Out of This World Adventures, 
which is famed as the only sf mag 
with a comicbook bound in the cen- 
terfold. 

The Hardcover Boys 

Lots of science-fiction fans edited 
magazines or paperbacks . New 
York fan Larry Shaw, who once 
dwelt in a slan shack called “Little 
Jarnevon” and was later to found 
Infinity Science Fiction and Science 
Fiction Adventures, its companion 
magazine, to edit paperbacks under 
the Regency imprint and who is 
currently the editor of Lancer Books 
. Robert W. Lowndes, an old- 
timer from Science Fiction League 
days, has headed a host of prozines 
like The Original Science Fiction 
Stories and others, now edits The 
Magazine of Horror, Famous Sci- 
ence Fiction, etc,, plus editing paper- 
backs for Airmont Books and hard- 
cover science fiction for Avalon . 
and Forrest J Ackerman, the Giant 
of Los Angeles, who runs a passel of 
movie magazines like Famous Mon- 
sters of Filmland and Monster World

IF 




and Screen Thrills . and loads of 
other people too numerous to men- 
tion. 

But there’s another aspect of 
editing that the fans have gone into, 
and that’s hardcover books. Right 
after World War II new book pub- 
lishers opened up left and right, and 
plenty were devoted to science fic- 
tion exclusively. Like Shasta Press, 
dream-child of two well known Chi- 
cago fans, Mel Korshak and Ted 
Dikty, which published a good num- 
ber of good ones, including Denver 
fan Stanley Mullen’s Merrittesque 
fantasy. Kinsmen of the Dragon. 
Or Lloyd Arthur Eshbach’s Fantasy 
Press which put Doc Smith’s “Sky- 
lark” series into hardcover, as well 
as the “Lensman” novels and books 
by Jack Williamson, A.E. Van Vogt 
and others. Or Gnome Press, found- 
ed by fans David A. Kyle and Marty 
Greenberg, which published Asimov’s 
“Foundation” trilogy and Howard’s 
“Conan” series. Or the indefatigable 
William H. Crawford, a fan from 
the 1930’s possessed by the itch to 
publish, who actually had that rare 
thing in fandom: a goodly supply 
of ready cash! 

Crawford began with an in- 
credibly ambitious printed fanzine 
called Marvel Tales, with fiction by 
Lovecraft, David H. Keller, Robert 
E. Howard, Robert Bloch, Clifford 
D. Simak and others of comparable 
note. Then Crawford published 
pamphlets by Clark Ashton Smith, 
etc. His first venture into hard- 
cover was an historic one: the first 
and just about the only book of 
Lovecraft’s published in his lifetime. 

The Shadow Over Innsmouth 

« 



(1936), today a very rare collector’s 
item. Crawford also published the 
fine pamphlet collection, Garden of 
Fear, launched a slick newsstand sf 
magazine in 1953 named Spaceway, 
and for many years after the war 
operated a hardcover house, F.P.C.I., 
which brought much of Sprague de 
Camp and L. Ron Hubbard into 
print. 

Among all these magazine editors 
and book publishers who were once 
fans are a certain number perhaps 
better known to you as science- 
fiction writers. Damon Knight and 
Lester del Rey, both old-time fic- 
tion fans and later extremely prom- 
inent sf writers, had a fling or 
two at editing magazines. Over in 
England, virtually aU the sf mags 
drew their editors from the fan 
ranks, such as Walter Gillings, who 
founded Science Fantasy, and Ted 
Camell, who founded New Worlds, 

And leave us not overlook 
Frederik Pohl. It’s a debatable point 
whether Fred Pohl (whose fannish 
career goes back at least to 1933 
and the Brooklyn Science Fiction 
League, is better known as the au- 
thor, co-author or editor of no less 
than 31 books (by my count) or as 
the editor of Galaxy, If and Worlds 
of Tomorrow, 

But out of all this, I hope you 
get my point. If science-fiction fan- 
dom does not “officially” have any 
purpose for its organized existence 
other than giving pleasure to its ad- 
herents, it at least serves a very use- 
ful purpose which supplies it a 
rationale. That is, the thing acts as 
a breeding-ground and training field 
for the science-fiction professionals

of tomorrow. This is a positive, “good 
thing” in many ways: it gives tiie 
field a tradition (au^ors are “bom” 
into it, so to speak, and when they 
switch to professional they know 
what they’re doing, unlike the hack 
writers who from time to time stray 
into the field and try to make a 
success of it without really knowing 
or caring much for science fiction 
as literature) and it works to con- 
stantly improve the field (most edi- 



tors are just “doing a job,” but ex- 
fans working »in sf as editors and 
publishers have a sense of dedica- 
tion). And the ones who become 
writers in the field generally try to 
advance it, to help it mature and 
break new ground. A truly surpris- 
ing number of the best and most 
famed science-fiction writers of all 
time are ex-fans. Next issue we’ll 
take a look at some of them.

Adam’s Eva 

by ALAN DIRKSON 

Illustrated by FINLAY 

The world of robots was just 
waiting for humans to serve. 

But where were the humans? 



I 

A dam Pilot was bom on 1 July 
2997. His parents, Sam and 
Ivan Pilot, bad put together every 
component in his body from stand- 
ard parts supplied by the factory. 

“This is indeed a blessed moment, 
brother,” intoned Sam Pilot, his met- 
al face gleaming as he lovingly pol- 
ished the unborn individual with an 
oily rag. 

“Yeah,” Ivan Pilot grunted. His 
gaze slid from his relative to the 
countdown clock and back again. 



“Yessir!” Sam Pilot enthused. 
“Few joys can be compared to par- 
enthood. Parenthood is the legiti- 
mate fulfillment of the individual, 
the giathering together and assem- 
blage of factory components in the 
unique act. Even if it means work- 
ing overtime — and overtime itself 
is an honor that every self-respect- 
ing individual ...” 

‘Tour minutes till birth,” cut in 
Ivan Pilot. 

Sam Pilot looked up, blinked. 
“Sure. Four minutes till the blessed 
event. Four minutes before yet an-

other individual is launched into the 
world for the better service of so- 
ciety.” Beaming; he squirted a few 
drops of Government Standard Oil 
on Adam’s head and continued pol- 
ishing. 

Ivan Pilot reached beneath a pile 
of cotton waste and grasped the 
handle of a specially geared screw- 
driver. “Better check readings,” he 
said quietly. 

“Yes, sir,” replied Sam Pilot. 
“This is our great moment, brother, 
our personal act of creation, our af- 
firmation of the dignity and worth 
of the individual. This here will be 
the happiest event in my life.” With 
that he stamped a dated birthmark 
under Adam’s left arm and crossed 
to the control panel. 

Ivan Pilot took two strides to 
Adam’s side. Swiftly he fitted the 
screwdriver to Adam’s chest, remov- 
ed six screws, then lifted the mod 
plate. Inside were three dials set at 
maximum. As he turned the nearest 
dial, there was a blinding flash, then 
darkness. 

A dam Pilot sat up shakily, blinked, 
looked ’round. The room was 
full of smoke, and there was a smell 
of burning. On the floor Ivan Pilot 
lay crumpled. In a corner Sam Pilot 
cowered, face hidden by his hands. 

“Why should this happen to me,” 
moaned Sam Pilot. “I’ll never out- 
live the disgrace. A relative of mine 
actually undoing the . no!” 
“What’s happened?” gasped Ad- 
am, rubbing his eyes. 

Sam Pilot looked flinchingly at 
him. “Shameful, immodest, inde- 
cent!” he wailed. 



“But what’s wrong?” pleaded Ad- 
am bewilderedly. 

“You’re exposed!” Sam Pilot 
croaked. “Do yourself up.” 

Only then did Adam notice his 
mod plate. Hastily he crammed it 
on, replaced the screws with his 
fingers. 

“Are you decent now?” Sam Pilot 
asked. 

“I — I think so,” replied Adam. 

Sam Pilot turned round, wiped his 
forehead with an oily rag. He led 
Adam into an adjoining room and 
there he said sternly, “Let us try to 
forget this shameful incident. You 
must never speak of it again.” 

“But what’s so shameful?” asked 
Adam. 

“What’s shameful?” spluttered 
Sam Pilot. Then he bit his lip, 
swallowed, rubbed his hands togeth- 
er and said, “Sit down, my son, and 
I will tell you what my fathers told 
me, and then you will understand.” 

And so Adam sat at the feet of 
his father and learned of the shame- 
ful screws that he must never again 
touch except in due process of law- 
ful cleansing. 

“Remember, my son,” concluded 
Sam Pilot, “and let what has hap- 
pened be a lesson to you. You may 
at times be tempted to undo those 
screws, but it is your privilege, your 
fulfillment to overcome this tempta- 
tion and divert your energies and 
drives into the wholesome pursuit 
of service to the community.” 

“What is this service to the com- 
munity?” Adam couldn’t help ask- 
ing. “And does it really fulfill one?” 

Sam Pilot’s eyes slid from Adam’s. 
He fidgeted, jumped up. “Service is 



98 



IF 




the most satisfying, fulfilling com- 
modity known to individuals,” he 
droned. “It is the greatest, most 
wonderful, most honorable and deep- 
est experience there is. Indeed, with- 
out service I can safely say there 
would be no reason for our exis- 
tence.” 

“But what is it?” Adam asked en- 
treatingly. 

“That, my son, you will discover,” 
Sam Pilot replied and disappeared 
from the room. 

Adam was about to follow his 
father, when instinct made him act 
otherwise. From a dispenser in the 
wall he drew a tablespoon of oil, 
swallowed it, and with a warm glow 
of well-being spreading through his 
system he took an escalator and 
found himself in the street. Compos- 
edly he worked his way onto the 
fast lane of the conveyor strip and 
looked about him. 

O n every side gleaming buildings 
hundreds of stories high stretch- 
ed away towards the horizon. Some 
were being built, others torn down, 
and everywhere immense billboards 
shrieked in sonorized 3D neon: FOR 
SALE. FOR SALE. FOR SALE. 
Adam listened to snatches as he 
whirled along. “ . three thousand 
diplomat's suites with indoor land- 
scape gardens four thousand 

bachelor flats with split-level swim- 
ming pools nine thousand 

luxury apartments with rotating liv- 
ing rooms and panoramic windows 

ff 

Adam listened in awe and wond- 
ered where he would live. Five min- 
utes later he arrived at the airport. 



He left the conveyor strip, passed 
rows and rows of waiting taxicraft, 
and entered the echoing building. 

From a computer he drew a sheet 
of instructions: Flight 10 New York 
to Paris, leaving in an hour, he read 
and proceeded onto the apron. As 
he neared the gleaming jet, a yellow 
Government Standard tanker dis- 
connected its hoses and drove off, 
and Adam saw a personal service 
individual waiting at the foot of the 
gangway. He knew what she was by 
her smaller stature, slender shape 
and lavender skin. 

“Morning, Captain. I’m Eva Hos- 
tess,” she greet^, holding out her 
hand. 

Adam took the slim fingers in his, 
noticed with approval the healthy 
oily sheen of her exterior. 

“Should be a wonderful trip for 
the Passengers,” Eva said enthusias- 
tically. “Fve managed carnations for 
every table, and the very latest film 
for flight showing.” 

“That’s great,” replied Adam, and 
found himself still holding her hand. 
His glance flickered to her mod plate 
and he felt a strange desire to run 
his fingers over her lavender sur- 
faces. 

“Please inspect the . passenger 
compartment. Captain,” Eva said 
and led him up the gangway and 
into the cabin. Adam looked round. 
The windows sparkled, safety-belt 
buckles shone, paper bags were dis- 
cretely tucked beside every seat and 
on each table colored flower petals 
had been cunningly woven to form 
the word “Welcome.” 

“Fine, fine,” Adam said admir- 
ingly and asked about refreshments. 



ADAMES EVA 



99 




Eva showed him the trolley with 
champagne, loibster salad, spring 
chicken, asparagus tips, alpine straw- 
berries. 

“And what’s this?” Adam asked, 
picking up a screw-top jar. 

“Caviar,” answered Eva. 

Adam tried to turn the lid but it 
wouldn’t budge. 

“Here, let me show you, Cap- 
tain,” Eva said, and with a few quick 
twists she flipped it off. 

Adam stared puzzledly and won- 
dered why he hadn’t been able to 
undo it. 

“I’ll just whip up a few canapes,” 
Eva said, spooning caviar neatly on- 
to small squares of toast and cutting 
slivers of lemon. “Do you think the 
Passengers will like them?” 

“Sure,” Adam murmured and 
nodded his head appreciatively. This 
was the sort of trim, efficient hos- 
tess he would always like to work 
with. 

Together they went down the 
gangway and waited to receive the 
Pissengers. Adam felt very proud 
standing in front of his shiny jet 
beside his smart hostess and began 
to understand what his father had 
meant by “the wholesome satisfac- 
tions of service to the community.” 
It was great to think that a hundred 
and fifty Passengers would trusting- 
ly put their lives in his hands. 

“Oh, dam,” Eva exclaimed, “I’ve 
forgotten the gifts.” She hurried up 
the gangway and returned with a 
tray of souvenir flags; minute 
squares of (beautifully embroidered 
silk on diamond-studded gold pins. 
Some were decorated with stripes 
and stars, others were red with two 



crossed implements in the corner. “I 
sewed ^them myself,” Eva told him 
proudly. 

At that moment the airport loud- 
speaker announced, “Will Passen- 
gers for flight ten to Paris please re- 
port to gate seventeen and embark?” 

Eva Hostess took two pairs of 
white kid gloves from her satchel 
and handed one to Adam. As he 
pulled them on he felt the nervous 
excitement every airline captain must 
feel the first time he waits to shake 
hands with his Passengers. 

Eva fiddled with the flags on her 
tray and kept glancing at the air- 
port. “Here comes the bus,” she said 
in an anxious tone. 

A dam watched the bus pull away 
from the terminal buildings, 
roll to a stop close to the gangway. 
The automatic doors swished open, 
an individual emerged, unrolled a 
red carpet, saluted, called out, “Will 
Passengers please transfer?” 

A minute later he called again in 
a louder voice, “Will Passengers 
please transfer, ladies and gentle- 
men!” Then he shrugged ihis shoul- 
ders, rolled up the carpet; the doors 
slid shut and the bus drove off. 

“But — there aren’t any Passen- 
gers,” stuttered Adam. 

“Can’t be helped,” gulped Eva, 
and retreated up the gangway. 

“Do we just leave empty?” Adam 
blurted. 

“Of course,” called Eva. “There’s 
the schedule.” 

Ground crews prepared to roll the 
gangways clear, and Adam climbed 
into the cabin. He ran his eye over 
the controls. Take-off systems.

green. Electronic systems, green. 
Fuel systems . He paused, frown- 
ed, flicked the infra-wave angrily to 
send, “Hullo, Control,” he radioed. 
“Main fuel tanks are empty, over.” 

“Roger. Taxi back to mainten- 
ance. Flight canceled,” Control re- 
plied. 

Bewildered, Adam jerked open 
the cabin door, strode into the pas- 
senger compartment. “What’s going 
on?” he demanded. 

Eva Hostess sat slumped at a 
table, her head in a pile of flower 
petals. “You’ll get used to it,” she 
whispered unhappily. “There’s a fuel 
shortage.” 

“But suppose we’d had Passen- 
gers!” Adam protested. 

Eva looked up. “There aren’t 
. .” she gulped, her eyes filling 
with tears. 

“Aren’t what?” 

“Aren’t ever any Passengers,” she 
sobbed. 

“Never?” Adam gasped. 

Eva shook her head. “Not till 
now,” she said bravely, wiped her 
eyes on some cotton waste and be- 
gan clearing. 

II 

A s Eva emptied lobster salad, 
spring chicken, asparagus tips 
and strawberries into the refuse bin, 
Adam watched silently. When she 
had finished, he said firmly, “I’m 
going to complain to Control.” 

“It’s not ^eir fault,” Eva told 
him. 

“They must have known about the 
fuel.” 

“Oh, no,” Eva assured him. “The 



tanker reported they’d filled us up.” 
“Then it was the tanker’s fault,” 
Adam replied, beginning to get an- 
gry. 

“Of course it wasn’t,” Eva replied. 
“They’d been to the depot for fuel.” 
“Well, who the hell’s fault was 
^t?” Adam burst out. 

“Nobody’s fault,” Eva explained. 
“If there’s no oil in the pipeline you 
can’t blame anyone.” 

Adam felt there was something 
wrong with this statement, but 
wasn’t sure what it was. He looked 
out of the window at the tankers, 
ground crews, airport buildings and 
asked baffledly, “But w^hy aren’t 
there any Passengers?” 

Eva Hostess swept up the rest of 
the flower petals, put away the sou- 
venir flags before answering. “Per- 
haps,” she said hesitantly, “perhaps 
it’s because the service isn’t good 
enough. Perhaps if we had garlands 
for every Passenger and scented the 
air with jasmine ...” She paused, 
clapped her hands excitedly. ‘That 
must be it. Just wait till next time.” 
Together they left the plane and 
walked across to the terminal build- 
ing. When they reached the entrance, 
Eva held out her hand. “Good-bye, 
Captain. We probably won’t be on 
the same flight for some time.” 
Adam clasped the small hand in 
his and stared into her eyes. “Can I 
see you off duty, then? How about 
tomorrow?” 

A pained expression flickered 
over Eva’s face. “I’m never off duty. 
Captain,” she replied with a sniff. 
“But I’m sure we would have made 
a wonderful crew and given the 
Passengers every satisfaction. Now

I must see about those garlands.” 
With that she dropped his hand, hur- 
ried into a door marked “Hostesses 
only”. 

As the door swung shut, Adam 
bunched his fists helplessly. He took 
three deep breaths, then relaxed. He 
would visit Personnel, ask for Eva 
to be assigned to him permanently. 
“Yes, sir!” Adam said loudly and 
set off for Administration. 

Instead, he found himself walking 
out through the automatic doors, 
down the steps, past the waiting taxi- 
craft, and returning to town on the 
fast lane of the conveyor strip. 

“Oh, well,” he said with a shrug 
and gazed up again at the giant 
buildings. It would be great to have 
an apartment on the very top with 
a view over the city and Eva to ar- 
range the flowers, he told himself. 

But at that moment he left the 
strip, crossed the street, and descend- 
ed into an underground bunker. He 
walked down endless concrete pas- 
sages to a bare numbered cell and 
entered. He drew his ration of oil 
from a wall dispenser, swallowed a 
tablespoonful, and with a comfort- 
ing glow of well-being spreading 
through his system he carefully pol- 
ished every inch of his skin with the 
remainder. Then, with a yawn, he 
lay down on a foam rubber bunk 
iind was soon asleep. 

E very day that week Adam was 
assigned a plane, but he only 
flew once and he never had any 
Passengers. He found the other hos- 
tesses a big disappointment. Their 
menus and cabin decorations left 
much to be desired, and as for their 



lavender skins and the rest, none of 
them bad that healthy oily sheen 
which miade him long to touch their 
surfaces with his fingers. 

The following Monday, Adam 
glimpsed a slim lavender figure 
crossing the tarmac carrying some 
boxes. “It’s her!” he cri^ and set 
off in pursuit. 

Near the plane he caught her up. 
Eva swung round, and her face lit. 
“Why, Captain!” she called hap- 
pily. “There’s sure to be Passengers 
today, won’t there? What’s the met? 
Will they need airsick tablets?” 

“Hang the Passengers!” Adam re- 
plied. 

“Captain, please!” Eva protested. 
“That’s hardly the attitude for a pi- 
lot about to fly.” 

“I’m off duty,” Adam told her. 
“Look, we must talk. Can’t we go 
inside?” 

“No,” Eva answered firmly. “I’m 
busy. There’s the air to scent with 
jasmine, and ...” 

“That’s just it,” Adam put in 
quickly. “You’re the best hostess 
I’ve flown with. Can’t we always 
work together?” 

Eva stiffened, said in a shocked 
tone, “What? Disobey flight instruc- 
tions!”- 

“Why not?” 

“No!” Eva snapped. “Start dis- 
obeying instructions and you end up 
on the scrapheap.” Turning her back 
on Adam, she lifted the lid of the 
top box, pulled aside the tissue paper 
and carefully drew out a garland of 
stephanotis. 

D uring the long, lonely months 
that followed, the memory of

Eva bending over with the waxy 
flowers white against her lavender 
surfaces filled Adam with a warm 
glow that was his only solace. 

Day after day he sniffed the air 
to try and catch the sweet fragrance, 
but as the weeks passed and he 
never saw any sign of the trim lav- 
ender figure, he knew something 
must be wrong. 

He pestered the other pilots and 
hostesses, but they hadn’t seen her. 
He spent his off duty hours on the 
airport roof, but without success. 
Every night when he returned to his 
cell and swallowed his ration of oil 
and the warm glow of well-being 
spread through his system, he made 
up his mind to ask Personnel where 
she was. But every morning when 
he arrived at the airport his resolu- 
tion failed him. 

Adam neglected his work, became 
irritable with the other hostesses and 
his appetite suffered. One evening 
he couldn’t face his oil, and he didn’t 
drink it till the morning. 

As he gulped it down, the warm 
glow of well-being spread through 
his system, and when he arrived at 
the airport his resolution didn’t fail 
him.* He strode into Personnel and 
demanded to make an inquiry. 

A worried clerk individual glanced 
up from a filing cabinet, then saw 
it was Adam. “Oh,” he said in a 
disappointed tone, “for a moment 
I thought . Ah, well, never mind. 
In any case, I can’t help you.” 

“\^^y not?” 

“We’re closed for card indexing 
and reorganization.” 

“It’s only a simple query,” pro- 
tested Adam. 



“There’s no such thing,” grumbled 
the clerk. “The computer’s blown a 
circuit. It takcS half an hour to find 
the right card. Anyway you need 
authority from an Executive.” 

“Okay,” Adam replied, “lead on.” 

The clerk individual laughed ner- 
vously, and his voice rose. “They 
haven’t come in today. Left me over- 
loaded. Look, there’s a million cards 
here and when I’ve cross-indexed 
them I’ll have a million and a half. 
I’d chuck it only I’m indispensable. 
Don’t you think they might show 
some consideration?” 

“Sure, sure,” Adam replied. “I’ll 
be. back.” 

The following morning Adam vis- 
ited Personnel, and the morning 
after, and the morning after. Final- 
ly he caught on. Storming into Per- 
sonnel, he banged the desk, then 
noticed it was a new clerk individ- 
ual. 

“We’re closed for cross-indexing 
and reorganization,” announced the 
new clerk, throwing cards into a 
shredder. 

“Yeah, I know,” Adam said, “and 
the Executives aren’t in either, cor- 
rect?” 

The new clerk nodded. “Gives 
me time to get things straight. But 
they’ll be in tomorrow.” 

“Tomorrow, huh!” snorted Adam 
and strode across to the filing cabi- 
nets. He jerked open a drawer and 
pulled out a card: Miss Helen Hurst. 
Divorced. No apparent Inorganicist 
tendencies . ., he read, and didn’t 
understand a word. 

“Hey! Leave that alone,” shouted 
the new clerk. “What are you play- 
ing at?”

Adam sighed. “I’m trying to trace 
a missing individual called Eva Hos- 
tess,” he answered the question 
despondently. 

“Individual?” frowned the clerk. 
“Can’t help you. We only keep rec- 
ords of Executives.” 

“Then who deals with individ- 
uals?” 

“No one. They don’t need to. In- 
dividuals are programmed for life. 
They’re reliable.” 

“Then Eva Hc^tess must still be 
working at the airport?” 

“Of course. Job permanency 
makes for efficiency. No point in 
changing individuals round.” 

“But what about the clerk who 
was here yesterday?” Adam ob- 
jected. 

The new clerk shrugged, “Oh, 
him? He had a breakdown. Not sur- 
prising with the state the records 
are in. Best place for him is the 
scrapheap.” 

“Scrapheap?” Adam echoed, re- 
membering what Eva had said. 
“What’s that?” 

“Huh?” The clerk individual rais- 
ed an eyebrow. “You must be new. 
That’s the dump for derelicts, mis- 
fits, failures, crooks and anyone who 
can’t measure up in certain ways to 
their job.” 

“You mean, if an individual is 
missing, that’s where he’ll eventually 
wind up?” 

“Yes. And good riddance!” 

“How do I get there?” Adam de- 
manded. 

‘Take any conveyor strip,” the 
clerk told him and threw some more 
cards in the shredder. “They all end 
at the scrapheap.” 



A n hour later, Adam found him- 
self standing on the empty track 
at the end of the line. The first 
thing he noticed was a smell of 
burning rubber and a gloomy haze 
that blotted out the sun. In the dis- 
tance reddish piles of refuse reached 
into the sky. Eva! Eva! he groaned. 
What could have driven her here. 

As he neared the scrapheap, the 
sounds of shouting, singing and the 
banging of metal objects reached 
his ears. Rounding a corner he came 
upon the cause of the disturbance. 

He stopped dead, gasped. On the 
ground half a dozen derelicts were 
sprawled in various attitudes, sing- 
ing and clashing tin mugs against 
their drab-red bodies. 

Hurrying up to the nearest one, 
Adam said all in a rush, “What’s 
wrong? Have you some disease? Can 
I help you?” 

The derelict stared at him, called 
out, “Hey, friends, look! Here’s a 
shiny!” 

The singing stopped, and derelicts 
crowded round. 

“Have a drink, shiny,” cried one, 
slapping him on the back. 

“Welcome — hie — to the scrap- 
heap,” called another. 

“T^is means a party. Come on, 
shiny, get lubricated.” 

“No, thank you,” Adam said 
firmly, and pushed aside the prof- 
fered mug. “I’m trying to trace a 
missing individual called Eva Hos- 
tess. Anyone seen her?” 

The derelicts muttered together, 
then shook their heads. “What you 
want with her?” asked one. 



ADAMES EVA

“There’s been some mistake,” 
Adam replied. “I’m taking her 
back.” 

At this there was commotion 
among the derelicts, and some began 
to laugh. 

“What? Leave the scrapheap!” 
cried one. 

“Shiny’s crazy!” called another. 

“No one ever leaves the scrap- 
heap,” put in a third. 

Adam felt as if his head was going 
to burst. “No one ever leaves?” he 
echoed. “But what’s the attraction?” 

“Tell him. Rusty,” someone 
shouted. 

Adam noticed a small individual 
propped against a pile of junk whose 
limbs were so corroded he could 
hardly stand. 

“Yeah, wise him up, Rusty,” 
bawled someone else. 

The corroded individual opened 
his mouth and immediately there 
was silence. “Ambition does it,” he 
rasped and took a sip from his mug. 

“Ambition?” queried Adam, 

“Yeah, ambition,” replied the cor- 
roded individual. “Take me. I start- 
ed with a soda fountain, expanded 
to an ice-cream parlor, mushroomed 
to a seven-story sund^ saloon. 
Nothing was too good for the Cus- 
tomers. My specialty was Omelette 
Surprise Flambee in seventeen dif- 
ferent temperatures.” 

“Why did you chuck it?” asked 
Adam. 

The corroded individual took an- 
other sip. “After forty years in the 
business I made a mistake — tasted 
the stuff. Horrible! Then I realized 
why there were never any Custom- 
ers. It broke my heart.” 



“But what made you come here?” 
Adam asked ^uzzledly. 

“This,” replied the corroded in- 
dividual, holding high his mug. 
“Glog, crude, slip, dope, lubricator, 
call it what you will.” With that he 
drained the mug and fell back on 
the pile of junk. 

Adam looked round the other in- 
dividuals and began to understand. 
“Where de you get that stuff?” he 
asked. “Can you draw your ration 
here?” 

“There ain’t no — hie — ration,” 
someone called. “There’s a Govern- 
ment Standard pump round the cor- 
ner. They serve anyone.” 

A s Adam followed the directions, 
he tried to work out what had 
happened to Eva. The stephanotis 
garlands must have been her last des- 
perate effort, and when the Passen- 
gers still didn’t come . 

"'Step up, step up for your free 
issue of Government Standard** 
Adam hastened towards the cries 
and soon came upon a pump. Be- 
side it stood a gleaming attendant 
individual serving oil to a long 
queue. 

“Step up, step up and drink your 
fill. Forget your troubles, forget 
your woes. Better than a holiday. 
Better than work. Step up and drink 
your fill,” chanted the attendant. 

Adam waited till the queue was 
served, then strode across. “This is 
criminal,” he stormed. “You’re turn- 
ing them into addicts.” 

“Quite right, friend,” said the at- 
tendant reasonably. “Just hold out 
your mug. One fill can’t do you any 
harm.” 



106 



IF 




“I haven’t got a mug,” Adam 
raged, “and I don’t want any oil.” 
“Course not,” soothed the attend- 
ant. “Here, borrow mine.” 

“No!” Adam shouted and threw 
the mug on the ground. 

The attendant picked it up, gave 
it a careful wipe. “Sorry, friend,” 
he said. “Newcomers often have res- 
idual guilt complexes which I do my 
best to allay. That’s my duty as 
scrapheap representative of the 
Highway Cleansing Department.” 
Adam sank down on the stone 
curbing, put his head in his hands 
and mumbled, “I — I’m rather con- 
fused. Can you explain?” 

“Certainly,” replied the attendant. 
“If it weren’t for me, these derelicts 
would clutter up the streets, steal 
honest individuals’ oil rations and 
generally cause a disturbance. In- 
stead they drift here.” 

“But it’s horrible letting them rust 
away.” 

“Not at all,” replied the attendant. 
“Death by rust is quite painless and 
even pleasant, I’m told. Besides, it 
rids society of its undesirables by a 
form of euthanasia which is entirely 
voluntary.” He eyed Adam for a 
moment. “Are you sure you haven’t 
any overwhelming problem, friend? 
Are you quite sure you don’t want 
to take the easy way ...” 

“No! No!” Adam shouted. 

The attendant sighed. “Pity. Then 
why exactly are you here?” 

Adam made a quick decision. 
“Look. You’ve got to help me. I’m 
searching for a personal service in- 
dividual who has been missing a 
week. She’s small, shapely, and has 
a lavender skin.” ^ 



“Had!” interrupted the attendant- 
individual. 

“What do you mean?” 

“It’s been raining recently.” 

“No!” Adam groaned and clutch- 
ed his head. Then an idea came to 
him. 

He straightened up and said, 
“All I need do is sit tight here. She’s 
bound to show, isn’t she?” 

“You haven’t a hope,” the attend- 
ant replied brightly. “There must be 
fifty pumps around the scrapheap. 
Better follow her example, friend,” 
he advised and began to fill a mug. 

“No! Never!” Adam cried and 
jumped to his feet. “I’ll find her.” 
“Come back if you don’t,” the 
attendant individual called after him. 
“We’re always open.” 

A ll afternoon Adam searched for 
Eva among the scrap. Finally 
he decided to climb one of the red- 
dish piles that reached into the sky. 
As he struggled upwards, his feet 
slipped on rusty skulls and several 
times small avalanches of limbs 
threatened to engulf him. From the 
top he gazed across the vista of des- 
olation that stretched for miles on 
every side, and a cold shudder passed 
through him. The attendant individ- 
ual was right: he’d never find Eva, 
not without help. And who would 
help him? Certainly not the derelicts, 
unless . 

Adam paused, his brow knotted 
in thought. Weren’t the derelicts in- 
dividuals who had been disillusioned 
because no one ever utilized their 
services? Suppose . 

Adam jumped up, a look of hope 
on his face. Hurrying down the

rusty pile, he soon found what he 
was seeking: a lone derelict sprawled 
upon the ground. 

“Hi, friend,” Adam greeted. 
“What’s your name?” 

The derelict scowled. “Hiram 
Taxi,” he mumbled. “What about 
it?” 

“Great!” Adam replied. “Some- 
one’s looking for you.” 

“What?” gasped the derelict. He 
sat up, wiped his mouth on the back 
of his hand. “Someone’s looking for 
mer 

“Yes,” Adam said quietly. 

“Who? Who?” demanded the der- 
elict. 

“A Passenger.” 

The derelict staggered to his feet. 
“A P-passenger!” he gulped. Pas- 
sengerr 

He roughly seized Adam’s arm. 
“Where? Where?” 

“Steady,” Adam said, disengag- 
ing his arm. “She’s called Miss Eva 
Hostess and she’s down here asking 
for you.” 

The derelict laughed a cracked 
laugh. 

“Well, she couldn’t choose bet- 
ter, could she? I mean, my record 
— it’s accident free. And I know all 
the streetnames, don’t I? And the 
theaters, and the shortcuts?” 

“Sure,” Adam said gently. “Better 
go look for her.” 

“Yessir!” cried Hiram Taxi and 
limped away, rubbing himself with 
an oily rag and shouting, “Taxi. Taxi 
for Miss Eva Hostess.” 

Before the day was out the scr- 
apheap rang with the cries of dere- 
licts with services to perform for 
Miss Eva Hostess. 



E very nigjht, Adam’s helpers met, 
and he listened anxiously to 
their reports. As each unsuccessful 
day ate away his hopes, only the 
care of his small band sustained him. 
In the evenings he rationed out 
their tablespoons of oil and organiz- 
ed mutual polishing sessions. Soon 
their rusty skins were quite shiny 
again, and Adam noticed a contented 
sense of purpose spreading through 
the band. “Don’t worry, friends, 
we’ll soon find Miss Eva,” said one. 
“We won’t ever let her go, friends, 
will we?” said another. “Course we 
won’t,” said a third. “We’ll build 
her just about the fanciest house 
ever, with a Chippendale lift and 
built-in Louis XIV commodes.” 

As Adam listened to their enthus- 
iastic plans, one question tortured 
him. Would they ever find her? 
Then, the following afternoon, as 
he was filing the twenty-fourth notch 
on the iron bedstead he was using as 
a calendar, a breathless individual 
rushed up. 

“Found her! Found her!” gasped 
the individual, and collapsed at 
Adam’s feet. Slowly Adam pieced 
the story together. A new derelict 
had reported seeing Eva at the air- 
port. 

“No! Don’t believe it! Impossi- 
ble!” Adam mumbled, but he hur- 
ried to the conveyor strip, jumped 
aboard, sped past the smoky fac- 
tories and the gleaming apartment 
buildings and soon was striding up 
the steps of the airport terminal. 
From the top gallery he scanned the 
tarmac, and there, unbelievably, in 



108 



IF 




the distance, at the foot of a gang- 
way, he glimpsed the unmistakable 
trim lavender figure of Eva. 

He ran, ran, ran, and then Eva 
was in his arms, struggling and beat- 
ing his chest with her small lavender 
fists. 

Adam groaned, released her. 

“Really, Captain!” Eva gasped. 

“Where have you been?” Adam 
blurted. 

“That’s not your business,” Eva 
said coldly. 

“But I was afraid you’d become 
a derelict,” Adam cried. 

Eva’s expression softened slightly. 
“There’s no call to worry about me,” 
she told him. “We simply ran out 
of fuel in Australia. Now I must 
arrange the orchids.” 

“Please!” Adam begged, as Eva 
started up the gangway. “Listen just 
for one minute. I’ll never trouble 
you again.” 

Eva hesitated, glanced at her 
watch, nodded. 

Adam swallowed, then said in a 
rush, “Please, Eva, this is important. 
Since you’ve been away. I’ve been 
working in the scrapheap saving in- 
dividuals. Oh, I can’t explain every- 
thing now — but they believe in you. 
Like you do in the Passengers. But 
you exist, maybe the Passengers 
don’t. They need you, and I need 
you. You must come back with me 
to the scrapheap, and together we 
can save the derelicts.” 

For an instant Eva’s face lit with 
a glow Adam bad never seen before, 
then she said heavily, “But I’m not 
a Passenger, am I?” 

“What do you mean?” 

Eva shrugged. i‘I have to serve.” 



“Then come and serve the defe- 
licts!” 

“No,” Eva said in a strained voice. 
“Don’t you see there’s no point?” 
“But there is,” Adam argued. 
“The derelicts I saved help have 
other derelicts. It’s the best service 
there is.” 

“And when all the derelicts are 
saved?” Eva asked. “What then?” 
Adam opened his mouth to reply, 
but no words came. 

“Exactly.” Eva sighed. “There’d 
still be no Passengers.” 

A s Eva disappeared inside the 
plane, Adam pressed his hands 
to his face. If only she had become 
a derelict. He imagined himself pol- 
ishing her rusty surfaces, helping re- 
habilitate her. Then he thrust the 
thought away. He still had his band, 
didn’t he? Despite what Eva had 
said, that was still worthwhile. 

When Adam arrived back at the 
scrapheap, it was almost dark. As 
he waited for his helpers to gather, 
he began filing out the twenty-six 
notches in the iron bedstead. There 
was no point thinking about Eva 
ever again. Finally it was finished. 
In the distance derelicts crouched 
over smoldering fires warming mugs 
of oil. But where was his band? He 
jumped up alarmed; a horrible fore- 
boding filled him. Before he’d gone 
a hundred paces, his suspicions were 
confirmed. Hiram Taxi lay sprawled 
upon the ground, oil dripping from 
his parted lips. 

“Hiram!” Adam cried, shaking 
the prostrate form. 

Slowly the eyes slid open and the 
oily lips moved, “Shove off!” 



ADAM'S EVA

“What’s happened?” Adam beg- 
ged. 

“You said she was a Passenger.” 
V 

A nd so Adam became an outcast 
even in the land of outcasts. 
Endlessly he trudged the scrapheap 
extolling sobriety and shininess, but 
no one heeded him. He took to 
squatting on the top of refuse piles 
and staring out over the derelicts, 
past the distant apartment buildings, 
to where the airport lay on the hori- 
zon, thinking about Eva and won- 
dering What it all meant. There had 
to be an answer, he told himself, 
scratching his mod plate. 

One evening, clambering up one 
of the piles, Adam caused a land- 
slide. When the cascade subsided, 
he heard a groan and near the bot- 
tom of the pile found a blackened 
hulk half-uncovered by the slide. 
This was no derelict suffering from 
rust disease. This disease was some- 
thing Adam had never seen and far 
more terrible. The hulk’s chest was 
striated with blistered riverlets, and 
areas of its body had sunk inwards. 
As Adam leaned over it, the hulk 
opened one eye. “Oil, oil,” it gasped. 

Swiftly Adam procured a can of 
Government Standard, cradled the 
blackened head, poured oil between 
the twisted lips. 

“Ugh I” spluttered the hulk and 
spat out the oil. “Shell, please,” it 
croaked. 

“Shell?” repeated Adam. “What’s 
shell?” 

The hulk groaned. “Is the war 
over?” 



“What war?” 

“Fetch me a human,” moaned the 
hulk. “I need repair.” 

“What’s a human?” 

The hulk blinked up at him. 
“W — what year is it?” 

“2998,” replied Adam, frowning. 

“2998,” gasped the hulk excitedly. 
Its eye stared, its mouth quivered 
two convulsive spasms racked its 
body, and Adam thought the end 
had come. Slowly, agonizingly, it 
fought for breath, whispered, “We 
. won.” 

Adam stared puzzedly at the black- 
ened form. Gently he lifted the left 
arm, glanced at the birthmark. 1995, 
he read and felt his pulse quicken. 
The hulk had been lying there a 
thousand years. The cascade must 
have reactivated it. 

The hulk moaned, its breathing 
became fainter. “No humans — no 
service. We’re free,” it whispered, 
and a contented light flickered in its 
sunken eye. 

“Humans? echoed Adam, who 
slowly began to understand. “You 
mean, clients? Executives? Passen- 
gers?” 

The blackened head nodded faint- 

ly- 

“But what’s happened to them?” 
gasped Adam. “We need them.” 

Apprehension flittered over the 
hulk’s features; its single eye fixed 
on Adam’s mod plate. “Inorganics 
supreme,” it quavered. 

Adam stroked the blackened fore- 
head as the hulk fought for life. 
Every now and then the lips twitch- 
ed. Finally, as if mustering itself 
for one last effort, the hulk raised 
its head, rasped, “Library.” 



110 



IF 




“Yes?” Adam prompted genitly. 
The bulk o^ed its other eye» 
stared at Adam ^nritU a look of seren- 
ity, then fell ha^, lay still. 

A ll that night Adam twisted and 
turned on his foam-rubber bunk. 
The hulk must have known the an- 
swers: about the humans, about Eva, 
about what it all meant. But why 
had it been content there were no 
humans? And what had it meant by 
library? 

Adam had seen the library from 
the conveyor strip. It was a large 
domed building surrounded by 
pieces of metal known as sculpture. 
Next morning he took the conveyor 
into the city determined to discover 
what it was. 

When Adam emerged from the 
lift marked “Readers Only,” a row 
of individuals behind little windows 
jerked up. “This way for the clas- 
sics.” “Geology section here, sir.” 
Slowly the hubbub died. “Oh,” 
sighed the individuals and lost in- 
terest. 

Adam looked round the great hall 
in wonder. Empty tables filled the 
center, and stretching up the walls 
as far as the eye could see were Tows 
and rows of slim rectangular objects. 
Adam removed one, and it fell open 
with a shower of dust. As Adam 
flipped through the sheets of small 
print and glanced at the pictures of 
odd individuals enclosed in curious 
coverings, he began to understand. 

At that moment a bent individual 
wearing green gloves and a sour ex- 
pression, hurried across. “I’m the 
supervisor,” the bent individual 
snapped. “What do you want?” 



“This is great!” Adam replied ex- 
citedly. “I mean, you keep all the 
records here, don’t you? Now I can 
find the answers.” 

“What answers?” inquired the 
supervisor coldly. 

“Why there are no Executives 
and no Passengers,” Adam told him, 
“and what . .” 

“You mean you want to look at 
the books?” the supervisor inter- 
rupted, rubbing his chin. 

“Of course,” Adam replied, start- 
led. 

“Consultation by individuals is il- 
legal,” the supervisor said sternly. 

“Illegal?” Adam frowned. “Why?” 

“Library rules.” 

“Look,” Adam pleaded. “It can’t 
matter to you. Just turn a blind eye, 
huh?” 

“No,” barked the supervisor. “If 
you don’t leave immediately. I’ll call 
the Police.” 

The supervisor hurried to his desk. 
Adam read feverishly; he might 
have time to discover something. 

Five minutes passed, fifteen min- 
utes passed, and an hour later the 
Police still hadn’t arrived. Adam 
stopped grabbing random books and 
settled down to study the layout of 
the sections. By evening he felt he 
knew his way around. 

As Adam left the library he 
passed the supervisor individual. 
“Thanks for changing your mind,” 
he said quietly. 

The supervisor glared at him. 
“The police weren’t in,” he growled. 
“But they’ll be back tomorrow.” 

E very day Adam went to the li- 
brary and on the empty tables he

laid the dusty books and read about 
the gifted organic beings who had 
created his race in their own image 
and disappeared. 

Together with agriculture and 
commerce, war seemed to have been 
the chief occupation of the humans. 
Adam followed the courageous, cen- 
turies-long struggle for political, re- 
ligious and racial freedom. With 
the perfection of cybernetics towards 
the end of the twentieth century, 
even economic freedom seemed to 
have been attained. But to upset this 
utopia one more ideological slogan 
emerged: elemental equality. In that 
great work of political philosophy. 
Inorganic Man, Xram Lrak claimed 
that inorganics were not only equal, 
but superior to and fit to supersede 
humans in accordance with the true 
tenets of dialectical materialism. 

These claims were amply substan- 
tiated in the twenty-sixth Olympiad 
where inorganics representing the 
Peoples’ Republic swept the board. 
Immediate objections were lodged 
by Western team captains, and dem- 
onstrators carrying placards tried to 
prevent inorganic competitors from 
leaving the Olympic village. The 
first casualty in the elemental strug- 
gle occurred when a spectator threw 
himself in front of three inorganic 
athletes, who only needed a last lap 
of forty-eight seconds for a sub- 
three-minute mile, and was trampled 
to death in vain. Anti-inorganic feel- 
ings mounted. Newspapers calcu- 
lated that an army of inorganics 
could run non-stop from Peking to 
Paris in seven weeks without refuel- 
ing. Diplomats demanded on-the- 
spot inspections of inorganic-produc- 



ing factories to check that UN 
agreed subservience factors were be- 
ing respected. Tensions reached 
boiling point with both sides pre- 
senting ultimatums — and there the 
information stopped. 

For a thousand years no records 
had been written, and slowly the re- 
alization dawned on Adam: the hu- 
mans had destroyed themselves. 
There would never be any Clients, 
Executives, or Passengers — the in- 
organics were condemned to frus- 
trated subjection for ever. 

But something puzzled Adam. 
What was this about subservience 
factors? Was there some method of 
altering them? He crossed to the In- 
dex Room and thumbed feverishly 
through the cabinets. Nothing un- 
der subservience. Nothing under in- 
dividuah Then he held his breath 
and drew out a card. Inorganic 
Maintenance Manual. Security Sec- 
tion. Basement, he read. 

Adam hurried downstairs, entered 
a passage where the shiniest individ- 
ual he had ever seen sat oiling a 
piece of metal. On a steel door was 
written: NO INORGANICS BE- 
YOND THIS POINT. 

“Can you read, bud?” grunted the 
shiny individual and waved the piece 
of metal. 

“Sure,” Adam replied easily, and 
moved forward. ^^‘But that notice is 
out of date.” 

“Bluff won’t work,” growled the 
shiny individual. “One more pace, 
and I shoot.” 

Adam stopped. “Look,” he ca- 
joled. “Your aggressive instincts re- 
sult from being programmed by the 
humans for their own purposes. But 

IP 



112 




there aren’t any humans any longer. 
Let me through, and I may be able 
to readjust you so you become the 
pleasant person I’m sure you want 
to be. ” 

“Nerts,” barked the shiny individ- 
ual, squinting at Adam along the 
piece of metal. “You’ll be my sev- 
enth. Step forward if you’re going 
to. I can’t wait all day.” 

“Seventh!” Adam gasped. “Well, 
er — in that case I guess I’ll try 
again this afternoon.” 

“This afternoon?” frowned the in- 
dividual. “Persevering type. Might 
as well save us both the trouble.” 
With that he pulled the trigger, and 
there was a dick. 

For a moment Adam stared, then 
said in a relieved tone, “Run out of 
ammunition, huh? Don’t let it get 
you down. There’s more to life than 
shooting people.” He strode through 
the steel door, leaving the shiny in- 
dividual muttering something about 
getting more ammunition tomorrow. 

I t didn’t take Adam long to locate 
the Maintenance Manual. Mark- 
ed in red on the cover was: Top 
Secret. Human Eyes Only. Turning 
to the index, Adam found the en- 
try: Subservience Factor — See Mod 
Plate. 

With trembling fingers he flipped 
the pages and read. For three hours 
he pored over charts, diagrams and 
instructions; then he closed the vol- 
ume with a snap. Beneath the mod 
plate lay the mod center which con- 
trolled the personality. But to pre- 
vent individuals adjusting them- 
selves, they had been programmed 
with an anti-tamper factor so that 



only opposites could unscrew each 
other. Adam frowned and drummed 
his fingers on the shelf. How could 
anyone undo his mod plate if he 
couldn’t unscrew it himself? There 
was only one way to turn a screw, 
wasn’t there? But something troubled 
him. Something had once happened. 

As Adam rushed from the security 
section, he heard a grunt. In the 
corner of the passage the shiny in- 
dividual waved a can of gun oil. 
“Y’right, bud,” he said thickly. 
“Forty years I’ve guarded that darn- 
ed door. Well, I’m through.” 

Adam left the library, procured a 
screwdriver, hurried to the airport. 
For twenty-four hours he searched 
without oil or sleep until he caught 
sight of the familiar lavender fig- 
ure entering a plane. 

Adam ran up the orchid-decked 
gangway and slammed the hatch be- 
hind him. 

Eva whirled. “Gracious! What are 
you doing. Captain?” she gasped. 

For a second Adam hesitated. 
Never had Eva’s lavender surfaces 
seemed so delicate, so fragile. Then, 
in one smooth, swift movement, he 
slid his hand over her mouth, pin- 
ioned her to a seat, gagged her with 
a curtain. 

“Trust me,” he pleaded with the 
scared, uncomprehending eyes. *T 
won’t hurt you.” 

He picked up a jar of caviar, put 
it in her hands. “Undo it,” he said. 

Eva stared at him. 

“Undo it,” he ordered. 

Eva shrugged. Adam watched. In 
some uncomprehendible way, her 
hands moved backwards in a non- 
existent direction. Adam trembled. 



ADAM'S EVA 



113 




She was an opposite — uniquely and 
unfathomably opposite. He fitt^ the 
screwdriver, turned, and slowly her 
screws yielded. Then, with shaking 
hands, he took off her mod plate. 
Inside, set at maximum, were three 
dials marked Servility, Indifference, 
Chastity, and a red button marked 
Safety Switch, 

Adam pressed the red button, then 
turned the dials to zero. 

As he reset the last dial, Eva 
stopped struggling and her face lit 
with a glow he had seen once be- 
fore. “How did you know?” she 
breathed. 

“We’ve been programmed lor dif- 
ferent rotary directions,” Adam ex- 
plained. “Your screws are vhreaded 
differently from mine. It’s quite 
simple really. We’re opposites.” 

“Give that to me,” Eve whisper- 
ed. Then with simple and unaffected 
directness she unscrewed his mod 
plate. 

W hen it was off, Adam felt her 
fingers cool on his controls, 
and an intoxicating feeling spread 
through his system. He held out his 
hands; Eva took them. Gently he 
drew her to him, his controls touch- 
ed hers, then nothing mattered. 

Adam lost all sense of time. Only 
he and Eva existed. 

Engines began to whine. Eva pull- 
ed away. 

“We’re taking off,” she gasped. 
“You’d better hide. The captain will 
be here any minute. Quick, put back 
my mod plate.” 

Adam picked up the two pieces 
of metal, threw them down the 
refuse chute. 



' Eva’s eyes opened wide. “What 
are you doing?” she gasped. 

“This is our chance, Eva,” Adam 
said quietly. 

“You mean,” Eva said slowly as 
his words sunk in, “to become Pas- 
sengers?” 

“Isn’t that what we both want?” 
“I’m scared,” Eva cried, and clung 
to him. “If only we could. But 
we’re not humans.” 

“No. We’re superior to them,” 
Adam told her and tore down an- 
other curtain. 

VI 

F ifteen minutes later the captain 
entered. “Passengers, on behalf 
of Panworld Airlines, welcome to 
our Ultra Deluxe Flight,” he began, 
then caught sight of Adam and Eva. 

Adam raised his wine glass and 
clinked Eva’s. 

“We trust that our service . .” 
continued the captain, goggling at 
them, “that our service . .” he 
faltered, gulped, saluted. “Gee, Sir, 
Madam, welcome!” he babbled and 
fled back to his cabin. 

Adam hitched the curtains more 
securely round his shoulders and 
put his hand on Eva’s knee. 

From the. cabin came the sound 
of the captain shouting over the 
radio, “I’ve got two Passengers. 
PASSENGERS! Yeah, REAL! Of 
course I’m sure. They’re drinking 
champagne right now. Roger. 
Roger.” 

The plane began to turn, and 
Adam looked at Eva. “We’ve made 
it,” he said. “We’re committed. They 
need us.”

ADAM'S EVA

Eva nodded and put her hand in 
his. 

Ten minutes later the first escort 
planes arrived. By the time they 
reached the airport two hundred 
jets were flying round them in a 
close diamond formation only pos- 
sible because they were piloted by 
beings superior to and fit to super- 
sede the humans. 

Vast crowds were waiting on the 
tarmac. Hastily Eva put the final 
stitches in Adam’s trousers and he 
inspected her sarong. 

Thunderous cheers greeted them 
as they walked down the red- 
carpeted gangway. In the terminal 
building, delegates from all trades 
and services were waiting to greet 
them. All carried handy sonorized 
handouts and the clamor was deafen- 
ing. “Speech! Speech!” they roared. 

Adam looked at Eva in dismay. 
“What can I say?” he gasped. 

Eva squeezed his arm. “Don’t 
worry, darling.” 

Shakily, Adam held up his hand, 
and instantly there was silence. 
“Honest, loyal, hardworking indivi- 
duals,” he heard himself say, “much 
as we look forward to enjoying your 
services — ” he paused, and thou- 
sands of handouts were flung in the 
air, denting many skulls — “and 
much as we are eager to consume the 
products of your skills, today we 
are tired. All we require is accom- 
modation.” 

Obediently, all the delegates de- 
parted except the real estate agents, 
and Adam and Eva were besieged 
by two hundred dynamic salesmen. 

“Your private skyscraper for 
fifty million dollars,” shouted one. 



“Twenty per cent discount for ready 
cash*” ^ 

“Well, er,” mumbled Adam, 
“haven’t you anything cheaper?” 

“Don’t let’s haggle,” bawled a 
second. “Thirty million on the nail.” 

“Unrepeatable offer,” yelled a 
third. “Twenty easy installments of 
a million.” 

After an hour of haggling, a swea- 
ty individual thrust a contract under 
Adam’s nose and barked, “Just sign 
here, sir. Free to you for intros to 
other Clients.” 

The whole crowd fell silent in 
admiration. 

“Sure,” Adam said and signed 
with a flourish. 

Immediately they left in a taxi- 
craft and landed on the highest 
scraper in the town. Adam and Eva 
were shown round two hundred 
rooms. There were still seven hun- 
dred left to visit when Adam noticed 
Eva looking pale. “I think we’ll call 
a halt,” he told the agent. “We’ve 
had a long day.” 

“Certainly, sir. Of course, mad- 
am,” replied the agent understand- 
ingly. “The cupboards are stocked 
with all you need.” With that he 
bowed, and departed. 

And so, at last, Adam had his top- 
floor apartment with a view across 
the city and Eva to arrange the 
flowers. 

“You just sit and relax,” Eva told 
him. “I’ll get supper.” 

B ut Adam couldn’t relax. He 
walked up and down on the 
balcony while Eva poked in cup- 
boards until she found a bottle of 
olive oil. She laid a damask cloth. 



116 



IF 




heated the oil and served it in sil- 
ver goblets. 

“Supper’s ready, Adam,” she 
called, and lit two candles. 

? Adam sat and sipped his oil, but 
he wasn’t hungry. While Eva chatted 
away, he stared out of the window. 

Finally Eva asked, “What’s worry- 
ing you? I know there’s something. 
Tell me.” 

“It’s nothing,” Adam began, then 
sighed. “You’re right,” he admitted. 
“It’s what I told that agent.” 

Eva looked puzzled. 

“About introducing other Clients,” 
Adam explained. 

Eva laughed and said, “You could 
always seduce other hostesses.” 

“No,” Adam answered seriously. 
“They don’t attract me. I’ve no de- 
sire to remove anyone else’s mod 
plate.” 

“Well, we’re sure to find some 
solution,” Eva comforted him, and 
a strange expression glowed in her 
eyes. 

“We must,” Adam mused. “We 
can’t run the world on our own. 
There’s a lot that needs organizing 
— oil supplies; the derelicts — it 
will take years to get everything 
straight.” 

Eva smiled and raised her goblet, 
“Here’s to success,” she said. 

Adam took a sip of warm olive 
oil and felt much better. Eva was 
right. They’d find some way. And 
tonight he had Eva, and if any- 
thing she looked lovelier than ever 
with her lavender skin gleaming 
palely in the candlelight. 

After supper, Adam took Eva on- 
to the balcony, and as the moon 
rose over the horizon he kissed her. 



“Eva!” he breathed. “I guess I’m 
just about the luckiest individual 
ever.” But even as his mouth brush- 
ed her lavender lips, she groaned 
and staggered. 

“What’s wrong?” Adam gasped. 

Eva’s face twitched. “Help me in- 
side.” 

Adam picked her up and laid her 
on the couch. “I think I’m going 
to ... ’’she moaned. “Quick. Warm 
some oil. Hurry!” 

Adam rushed into the kitchen, 
filled a basin, put it on the stove. 
He cursed himself for not taking 
the maintenance manual. Th^e was 
a whole chapter on faults he had 
only glanced at. 

Then he heard a hiccup, a sharp 
intake of breath, and a cry. 

He ran back into the room. Eva 
was propped up on the cushions 
nursing a small replica of herself. 
“Isn’t he cute?” she said proudly. 

A dam gazed down at the infant. 

Its skin was shiny, just like 
metal. He took the small hand in 
his and found it to be quiet soft. 
He recalled reading something about 
plastic metal states and crystal re- 
production, and a sense of wonder 
filled him. 

“Gee, Eva,” he gulped. “This is 
great. I mean it’s ours, isn’t it?” 
Eva smiled, nodded. 

“And we can have another when- 
ever we want?” 

“Of course,” Eva replied fondly. 
“Well, that solves the housing 
problem,” Adam breathed, patting 
his son on the head. 

The baby began to cry, and Eva 
said, “I expect he’s hungry.” 



ADAM'S EVA 



117 




Adam ransacked the rooms until 
he found a cot, and soon the baby 
had been bathed and fed and was 
sleeping soundly. 

As Eva tucked in the bedclothes 
she remarked, “So we really are just 
like the humans.” 

“With improvements,” Adam re- 
minded her. 

Eva frowned, said slowly, “But 
why did they make us this way? I 
mean, why all these complicated ad- 
justments? As if they knew they’d 
be needed.” 

“Perhaps they did,” Adam mused. 
“Survival instinct. And they’ve 
passed it on to us,” he grinned, 
nodding at the baby. 

“Isn’t it marvelous!” Eva sighed 
happily. She snuggled up to Adam 
and yawned. “I’m tired. Let’s go to 
bed.” 

Adam took a deep breath and 
looked at Eva protectively. “You go 



ahead,” he told her. “I think I’d 
better bunk down in the sitting room 
tonight.” 

“What for?” Eva demanded. 
“Well — er,” Adam replied. “We 
don’t want another one of those in 
the morning do we? We ought to 
get organized first.” 

Eva laughed and put her arms 
around his neck. “Don’t worry, 
Adam. It’s quite safe.” 

“How do you know?” 

Eva kissed him, “I just know.” 
“How?” demanded Adam. 

Eva gave him the label she’d taken 
from the baby’s neck, and Adam 
read: Until replacements are re- 
quired set Chastity dial at maximum. 

Understanding broke slowly on 
Adam’s face, and he took Eva in his 
arms and whispered, “No wonder 
we’re fit to supersede the humans.”

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE

Earth is my home. But I haven't seen it now since I was a 
schoolboy, and I don't know when I'll ever see it again. 

The people from space visit Earth when they want to, and no 
one is ever the wiser. Maybe you've seen them yourself and never 
known. 1 was not that lucky. When I stumbled on a party of them, 
two men and a lovely young girl, they gave themselves away . 
and so they took me with them when I left. Would you call it kid- 
napping? They didn't. That word means stealing a human being, and 
to them I was only an animal. 

But I stayed with them, hunting wild beasts as their gun-bearer, 
until they met a beast more dangerous than themselves. The men 
died. The girl and I survived, marooned on an empty planet — until 
slavers came and took her from me. 

I followed the Lady Raire across the galaxy, found her, won 
her freedom — and lost my own. 

Now she was free . but I was a slave.

tube and fringed with feathery red 
gills. The ovea^eer talked to him in 
the local buzz-buzz and went away. 
He looked at me with big yellow 
eyes like a twin-yoked egg and said, 
“Welcome to the club, friend,” in 
perfect, unaccented lingua, in a 
voice that seemed to come from un- 
der a tin washtub. 

He told me that his name was 
Fsha-fsha. He had been left behind 
seventeen years before when the 
freighter he was shipping on had 
been condemned here on Drath after 
her linings went out, and he had 
been a slave since his money ran out, 
three months after that. 

“It’s not a bad life,” he said. 
“Plenty of food, a place to sleep, 
and the work’s not arduous, after 
you’ve learned the routine.” 

The routine, he went on to ex- 
plain, was Sorting. “It’s a high- 
level job,” Fsha-fsha assured me. 
“Only the top category workers get 
this slot. And let me tell you, friend, 
it’s better than duty in the mines, 
or on the pelagic harvesting raftsi” 

H e explained the work; it con- 
sisted of watching an endless 
line of glowing spheres as they came 
toward us along a conveyor belt, and 
sorting them into one of eight cate- 
gories. He told me what the types 
were, and demonstrated; all the 
while he talked, the bulbs kept 
coming, and his big hands flick^ 
the keys in front of him, shimting 
them their separate ways. But as far 
as I could tell, all the bulbs were 
exactly alike. 

“You’ll learn,” he said blandly, 
and flipped a switch that stopped 



the line. He fetched a lightweight 
assembly of straps from a wall lock- 
er. 

“Training harness,” he explained. 
“It helps you catch on in a hurry.” 
He fitted it to me with the straps 
and wires criss-crossing my back and 
chest, along my arms, cinched up 
tight on each finger. When he fin- 
ished, he climbed back on his stool, 
and switched on the line. 

“Watch,” he said. The glowing 
bulbs came toward him and his fin- 
gers played over the keys. 

“Now you follow through on your 
console,” he said. I put my hands on 
the buttons and he reached across 
to attach a snap that held them 
there. 

A bulb came toward me and a 
sensation like a hot needle stabbed 
the middle finger on my right hand. 
I punched the key under it and the 
pain stopped, but there was another 
bulb coming, and the needle stabbed 
my little finger this time, and I 
jabbed with it, and there was another 
bulb coming .... 

“It’s a sure-fire teaching system,” 
Fsha-fsha said in his cheery, sub- 
cellar voice. “Your hands learn to 
sort without even bringing the fore- 
brain into it. You can’t beat pain 
association for fast results.” 

For the rest of the shift, I watch- 
ed glorm-bulbs sail at me, trying to 
second-guess the pain circuits that 
were activated by Fsha-fsha’s selec- 
tions. All I had to do was recog- 
nize a left-forefinger or right ring- 
finger bulb before he did, and punch 
the key first. By the end of the first 
hour my hands ached like unlanced 
boils. By the second hour, my arms 



SPACEMANl 



121 




were numb to the elbow. At the end 
of three hours I was throbbing all 
over. 

“You did fine,” Fsha-fsha told me 
when the gong rang that meant the 
shift was ended. “Old Hruba knew 
what he was doing when he assigned 
you here. You’re a qui^k study. You 
were coding ten per cent above ran- 
dom the last few minutes.” 

H e took me along a damp-looking 
tunnel to a gloomy barracks 
where he and twenty-six other slaves 
lived. He showed me an empty al- 
cove, got me a hammock and help- 
ed me sling it, then took me along to 
the mess. 

The cook was a warty creature 
with a ferocious set of ivory tusks, 
but he turned out to be a good-na- 
tured fellow. He cooked me up a 
sort of omelette that he assured me 
the other man-slaves had liked. It 
wasn’t a gourmet’s delight, but it was 
better than the gruel I’d had in the 
hospital cell. 

I slept then, until my new tutor 
shook me awake and led me back 
to the Sorting line. 

The training sessions got worse 
for the next three shifts. Then I 
started to catch on — or my eye and 
fingers did; I still couldn’t conscious- 
ly tell one glorm-^bulb from another. 
By the time Fd been at it for six 
weeks, I was as good as Fsha-fsha. 
I was promoted to a bulb-line of 
my own, and the harness went back 
in the locker. 

The Sorting training, as it turned 
out, didn’t only apply to glorm- 
bulbs. One day the line appeared 
with what looked like tangles of 



colored spaghetti riding lalong on it. 

“Watch,” Fsha-fsha said, and I 
followed through as he sorted them 
into six categories. Then I tried it, 
without much luck. 

“You have to key-in your re- 
sponse patterns,” he said. “Tie this 
one — ” he flipped his Sorting 
key — “to one of your learned cir- 
cuits. And this one — ” he coded 
another gob of wires — “to another.” 

I didn’t really understand all that, 
but I tried making analogies to my 
subliminal distinctions among ap- 
parently identical glorm-bulbs — and 
it worked. After that, I sorted all 
kinds of things, and found that after 
a single run-through, I could pick 
them out unerringly. 

“You’ve trained a new section of 
your brain,” Fsha-fsha said. “And 
it isn’t just a Sorting line where this 
works; you can use it on any kind 
of categorical analysis.” 

During the off-shifts, we slaves 
were free to relax, talk, gamble with 
home-made cards and dice, com- 
mune with ourselves or sleep. There 
was a small, walled court we could 
crowd into when the sun shone, to 
soak up a little vitamin D, and a 
cold, sulphury-smelling cave with a 
pool for swimming. Some of the 
slaves from watery worlds spent a 
lot of time there. I developed a habit 
of taking long walks — fifty laps 
up and down the barrack-room — 
with Fsha-fsha stumping along be- 
side me, talking. He was a great 
story-teller. He’d spent a hundred 
and thirty years in space before he’d 
been marooned here; he’d seen 
things that took the curl out of my 
hair to listen to.

IF 




T he weeks passed, and I sorted, 
watched, and listened. The 
place 1 was in was an underground 
factory, located, according to Fsha- 
fsha, in the heart of the city. There 
was only one exit, along a tunnel 
and up a flight of stairs barred by a 
steel gate that was guarded day and 
night. 

“How do they bring in supplies?” 
I asked my sidekick. “How do they 
ship the finished products out? They 
can’t run everything up and down 
one Little stairway.” 

Fsha-fsha gave me what I had 
learned to interpret as a shrug. “I 
don’t know. Danger. I’ve seen the 
stairs, because I’ve been out that way 
quite a few times.” 

I stopped him and asked for a 
little more detail on that point. 

“Now and then it happens a slave 
is needed for labors above-ground,” 
he explained. “As for me, I prefer 
the peacefulness of my familiar rou- 
tine; still, so long as the finger of 
the Triarch rests here — ” he tapped 
a welted purple scar along his side — 
“I follow all orders with no argu- 
ment.” 

“Listen, Fsha-fsha,” I said, “Tell 
me everything you remember about 
your trips out: the route you took, 
the number of guards. How long 
were you out? How close did they 
watch you? What kind of weapons 
did they carry? Any chains or hand- 
cuffs? Many people around? Was it 
day or night? Did you work inside 
or outside — ” 

“No, Danger!” Fsha-fsha waved 
a square purple-palmed hand at me. 
“I see the way your mind’s working; 
but forget the idea! Escape is im- 



possible. And if you did break away 
from a work detail, you’d, still be 
alone in the middle of Drath, aa 
alien, not knowing the language, 
with every Rule-keeper in the city 
ready to pounce on you.” 

“I know ail that. But if you think 
I’m going to settle down here for 
the rest of my life, you’re dead 
wrong. Now start telling me: How 
many guards escorted you?” 

“Just one. As long as he has my 
controller in his pocket, one is all 
that’s needed, even if I were the 
most intractible slave in the pens.” 

“How can I get picked for an out- 
side detail?” 

‘“When you’re needed, you’ll be 
called.” 

“Meanwhile, I’ll be getting ready. 
Now give.” 

Fsha-fsha’s memory was good. I 
was surprised to hear that for as 
much as an hour at a time, he had 
worked unsupervised. 

“It’s no use creeping off and hid- 
ing out under an overturned cart or 
in an unused root-celler,” he said. 
“One touch of the controller, and 
you’re mewling aloud for your keep- 
er.” 

“That means we’ll have to get our 
hands on the control devices before 
we break.” 

“They’ve thought of that; the 
thing is tuned to your neuronic car- 
rier frequency. If you get within 
three feet of it, it’s triggered auto- 
matically. If the holder dies, it’s trig- 
gered. And if it’s taken off of the 
overseer’s body, the same thing.” 

“We can stand it long enou^ to 
smash them.” 

“If the controller’s destroyed, you 



SPACEAtANl 



123 




die,” he said flatly. “It’s covered any 
way you play it.” 

4 4 ^^hat’s where you’re wrong, 
' A Fsha-fsha.” I told him about 
crushing the controller the night I 
had been arrested. “Huvile didn’t 
die. The Rule-keeper saw him board 
Jongo //, an hour afterward.” 
“Strange. It’s common knowledge 
among the slaves that if your con- 
troller is damaged, it kills you.” 
“It’s a useful story for -the slave- 
owners to spread.” 

“Maybe that’s why they grabbed 
you so fast. You might have given 
the game away. Hell’s ice, if the 
slaves knew . .” 

“How about it, Fsha-fsha? Are 
you with me?” 

He stared at me in the gloom of 
the comer where we’d drifted to talk 
in private. “You’re a strange, rest- 
less creature. Danger,” he said. “For 
a being as frail as you are, with that 
soft skin and brittle bones, you’ve 
got an almighty urge to look for 
trouble. Why not take a tip from me 
and make the best of it?” 

“I’ll get out of here, Fsha-fsha 

— and get clear of the planet, too 

— or die trying. I’d as soon be dead 
as here, so I’m not risking much.” 

Fsha-fsha made the noise that 
served him as a sigh. “You know, 
we Rinths see the Universe differ- 
ently from you propagators,” he 
said. “With us, it’s the Great Parent 
that produces the spores. We work- 
ers have the mobility, the intelli- 
gence — but no future, except the 
Parent. We have the instinct to pro- 
tect the Tree, fertilize it and water 
it, prune it, insure its “survival; but 



we’ve got no personal stake in the 
future, the way you have. Your in- 
stincts tell you to stay alive and 
propagate. Your body knows this 
is a dead end as far as offspring go, 
so it tells you to get out or die.” He 
sighed again. “When I left Rinth, 
it was hard; for a long time, I had 
a homesticlaiess that you wouldn’t 
be able to understand — any more 
than I can reaUy understand the 
way you feel now. But I can remem- 
ber how it was. And if it’s anything 
like that with you — yes; I can see 
you’ve got to try.” 

“That’s right; I’ve got to try. 
But not you, Fsha-fsha. If you’re 
really content here, stay. I’ll make it 
on my own.” 

“You wouldn’t have a chance, 
Danger. I know the language, the 
routes around the town. You need 
me. Not that it’ll do any good in 
the end. But knowing about the con- 
trollers will make a difference.” 
“Forget it. You can teach me the 
language, and tell me all you can 
about the town. But there’s no point 
in your getting killed.” 

“That’s another advantage a Rinth 
has,” Fsha-fsha cut me off. “No in- 
stinct for self-preservation. Now, 
let’s get started planning the de- 
tails.” 

XXIII 

T he weeks went by. I sorted, slept, 
took my language lesson and 
worked to memorize the map of the 
city I drew up from Fsha-fsha’s 
descriptions. About two months after 
our decision to crash out, Fsha-fsha 
got a call for an outside detail. He 



SPACE/AAN! 



125 




vetoed my suggestion that I volun- 
teer to go along. 

“This is a lucky break,” he said. 
“It will give me a chance to look 
over the ground again, in the light 
of our plans. Rest easy. We’ll get 
our chance.” 

“We propagators aren’t as patient 
as you tree farmers,” I told him. 
“It may be another six months be- 
fore an outside detail comes up 
again.” 

“Better to propagate in your old 
age than not at all, eh?” he remind- 
ed me, and I had to bite my teeth 
and watch him go. I got one quick 
look at the passage as he left. It 
was narrow, dim-lit; the Drathians 
didn’t like a high level of illumina- 
tion. I wondered if there was a use- 
ful tip for me in that. 

Fsha-fsha came back rippling his 
gill-flaps in a way that I knew meant 
he was excited. But it turned out 
not to be pleased anticipation. 

“It’s hopeless. Danger,” he assur- 
ed me. “The Wormface in charge of 
the detail carries the controllers in 
a special rack, strapped to his chest 
for quick access. He keeps his dis- 
tance; ten feet was as close as I 
could get before he warned me 
back.” 

“What weapons did he carry?” I 
asked him. 

“What weapon does he need? He 
holds your life in his hand as it is!” 

“Too bad,” I said. “We’ll have 
to get our armaments somewhere 
else then.” 

Fsha-fsha goggled at me. “You’re 
an amazing creature. Danger. If you 
were cornered by a Fangmaster, I 
think you’d complain that his teeth 



weren’t larger, so as to provide you 
with a better dagger!” 

The routine settled in again then. 
Every day was like the one before; 
Ihe glorm-bulbs rushed at me in a 
stream that never ended, never 
changed. I ate omelettes, played 
revo and tikal and a dozen other 
games, walked my two miles a day, 
up and down the dark room and 
waited. And one day, I made a 
blunder that ended our plans with 
total finality. 

T he work-shift had ended half an 
hour before. Fsha-fsha and I 
had settled down in his alcove to 
play our favorite game of telling 
each other what we’d do, once we 
were clear of Ehath. A big Drathian 
slave who’d been assigned to the 
sorting crew a few hours earlier 
came lumbering over, breathing out 
fumes that reminded me of a pack- 
age of rotten broccoli I’d opened 
once by mistake. 

“I’ll take this alcove,” he said to 
Fsha-fsha. “Get out, animal.” 
“Makes himself right at home, 
doesn’t he?” I pointed across the 
room to an empty alcove. 

“Try over there, sport,” I said to 
the broccoli breather. “Lots of 
room — ” I got that far when he 
reached out with a couple of arms 
like boa constrictors and ripped 
down the hammock. He yanked 
again, and tore the other end free. 
He tossed it aside and swung his 
own kit down onto the floor. I stood 
up. 

“Wait,” Fsha-fsha said quickly. 
“The overseer will deal with this 
one. Don’t — ” 



126 



IF 




The big Dmthian took a quick 
step, threw a punch at me. I ducked, 
came up with a three-foot length of 
steel pipe the Rinth had tucked un- 
der the hammock for possible fu- 
ture use and brought it down in a 
two4ianded blow across the Dra- 
thian’s shoulder. He gave a bleat hke 
a branded steer and went down buck- 
ing and kicking. In his convulsion, 
he beat his head against the floor, 
whipped his body against the wall 
hard enough to give off a dull boom! 
like a whale slapping the water 
with his tail. Thick, yellowish blood 
spattered. Every slave in the barracks 
came crowding around to see what 
was going on, but in thirty seconds 
it was all over. The big Drathian 
was dead. 

The Rule-keepers got there a min- 
ute or two later and took me away, 
up the stair I’d looked forward to 
seeing for so long. 

My hearing didn’t amount to 
much. I explained to Hruha that the 
dead slave had attacked me, that I 
didn’t know Drathians kept their 
brains under their shoulder-blades, 
but it was an open-and-shut case. 
I’d killed a fellow slave. My Sort- 
ing days were over. 

“Transportation to the harvesting 
rafts,” the major-domo intoned in 
Drathian and repeated it in Lingua. 
“Too bad, Man,” he added in his 
unofficial voice. “You were a valu- 
able sorter. But like your kind, you 
have a savage streak in you, most un- 
becoming in a chattel.” 

They clamped my wrists in a steel 
ring and hustled me out into a court- 
yard where a big, tarry-smelling air- 
barge was waiting. I cJimbed aboard. 



and was kicked into a metal-walled 
broom-closet. They slammed the 
door on me, and I lay in the dark 
and felt the barge lift off. 

XXIV 

T he harvesting rafts were mile- 
square constructions of metal 
floats linked by woven-rope mats 
and carpeted with rotting vegetable 
husks and the refuse of the can- 
ning sheds that worked night and 
day processing the marine life hoist- 
ed aboard by the seining derricks. 
A pair of husky Drathians threw 
me off the side of the barge into 
foul-odored, ankle-deep muck. An- 
other pair grabbed me, knocked me 
around a little just to keep in prac- 
tice, and dragg^ me away to a long 
lean-to which served to keep the 
worst of the sub-tropical rains off 
any of the workers who were lucky 
enough to be off shift. They took 
off the wrist-irons and rigged a fine- 
gauge fiber loop around my neck, 
not tight enough to choke me, but 
plenty snug enough to wear the skin 
raw, until it toughened and formed 
a half-dnch-wide scar that itched 
and burned day and night. There 
was a lim p bladder attached to the 
rope, designed to inflate and keep 
my head above water if I happened 
to fall overboard. Slaves weren’t al- 
lowed to evade their labors by any- 
thing as easy as drowning, intention- 
ally or otherwide. 

I learned all this later. The first 
night the only orientation I got was 
what I could deduce from being 
dragged to a line of workers who 
were shelling out big crustaceans.

and yelled at to get to work. The 
command was emphasized with a 
kick, but I had been watching for 
that; I slid aside from it and smash- 
ed my fist into the short ribs of the 
Drathian and chopped him again as 
he scrambled back. My reward for 
this effort was a solid beating, ad- 
ministered by three Drathians, two 
holding me and one swinging a rod 
as heavy and limber as a golf club. 
They finished after a while, threw 
water over me, and someone shoved 
a sea-lobster at me. 

“Better look busy,” the slave on 
my left tipped me off. He was a 
medium-sized Drathian with a badly 
scarred face; that made us pals on 
two counts. I followed his advice. 

T here wasn’t anything compli- 
cated about the work. You 
grabbed your chzik, held him by 
the blunt end, hooked a finger under 
his carapace and stripped it off him. 
Then you captured his four flailing 
limbs and, with a neat twist of the 
wrist, removed them. The chziks 
were active creatures, and they 
showed their resentment of this 
treatment by writhing frantically 
during the operation. When you 
found yourself tackling a big fellow 
— weight ten pounds or more — it 
could sometimes be a little difficult 
to carry out the job as smoothly as 
the overseers desired. They usually 
let you know when this was the case 
by hitting you across the back with 
the golf-club. 

At first, my fingers had a tenden- 
cy to bleed, since the carapaces were 
razor sharp and as tough as plexi- 
glass, and the barbs on the legs had 



a way of lodging in my palms. But 
the wounds healed cleanly. The 
micro-organisms of»Drath were too 
alien to my metabolism to give rise 
to infections. And after a while cal- 
luses formed. 

I was lucky in timing my arrival 
near the end of a shift; I was able 
to look busy enough to keep the 
overseer away, and make it under 
my own power to the shed. There 
were no bunks, no assigned spaces. 
You just crowded in as far as pos- 
sible from the weather side and 
dropped. There was no insomnia on 
the rafts. The scarred Drathian — 
the same one who had given me 
some good advice the first night — 
helped me out again the next shift, 
by showing me how to nip off a 
chunk of raw chzik and suck it for 
the water content. The meat itself 
was spongy and inedible as far as I 
was concerned; but the slop dipped 
up to us at the regular feeding time 
was specially designed to be as- 
similable by a wide variety of spe- 
cies. When an offbrand worker 
showed up who couldn’t live on the 
stuff he soon starved, thus solving 
the problem. 

Instead of the regular cycle of al- 
ternating work and rest shifts, we 
harvesters worked two shifts out of 
three, which effectively prevented 
any chance of boredom. For six 
hours at a stretch, we manned our 
places by the chute with the squirm- 
ing heaps of chziks arriving just a 
little faster than we could shell them 
out. The slippery mat under foot 
rose and fell in its never-ending 
rhythm, and beyond its edge the 
steel-gray sea stretched to the hori- 



128

zon. Sometimes the sun beat down 
in a dead calm, and the unbelievable 
stink rose around us like a foul tide. 
At night floodlights glared from 
high on the derricks, and the insects 
swarmed in to fly into our mouths 
and eyes and be trampled underfoot 
to add to the carpet. Sometimes rain 
came, hot and torrential, but the 
line never slowed. And. later, when 
gray sleet coated the rigging and 
decks with soft ice, and the wind 
cut at us like sabres, we worked 
on, those of us who could stand the 
cold; the others settled into the muck 
and were hauled away and put over 
the side. And some of us who were 
stiU alive envied them. 

f remembered reading, years be- 
X fore, back on old Earth, of con- 
centration Camp prisoners, and 1 
wondered what it was that kept men 
going under conditions that made 
life a torture that never ended. Now 
I knew. It wasn’t a high-minded de- 
termination to endure, or a dauntless 
wni to take a blood-curdling re- 
venge. It was an instinct older than 
thought, older than hate, that said: 
“Survive!” 

And I survived. My hands tough- 
ened, my muscles strengthened, my 
skin hardened against the cold and 
the rain. I learned to sleep in icy 
slush, without protection, with horny 
feet stumbling over me in the dark, 
to swallow the watery gruel and 
hold out the cup for more, to take 
the routine club-blows of the over- 
seers without hitting back; in the 
end, wiftiout really noticing. There 
were no friendships on^the rafts, no 
recreations. There was no time or 



energy for anything not directly re- 
lated to staying alive for one more 
day. The Drathian who had helped 
me on the first day died one wet 
night, and another took his place. 
I had never even learned his name. 

During my years, in space, I had 
developed an instinctive time sense 
that told me when a week, or a 
month, Earth-style, had passed. I 
had been almost five years away, 
now. Sometimes I wondered what 
had happened during those years, 
back on that small planet. But it was 
so far away that seemed more like 
a dream than a reality. 

But for hours at a stretch, some- 
times for a whole double shift, my 
mind would wander far away from 
the pelagic rafts of Drath. My 
memories seemed to become more 
vivid with time, until they were al- 
most realer than the meaningless life 
around me. 

And then one night, the routine 
broke. 

A morose-looking Drathian boss- 
overseer caught me as I went toward 
the chzik chute, shoved me toward 
the boat wharf. 

“You’re assigned as a net- 
handler,” he told me. Except for 
the heavy leather coat he was wear- 
ing, he looked as cold and filthy 
and miserable as the slaves. I climb- 
ed down into the twenty-foot dou- 
ble-prowed dory that was pitching 
in the choppy water at the foot of 
the loading ladder, and we shoved 
off. In five minutes the high-sided 
raft was out of sight in the ragged 
fog. 

I sat in the stern and stared at 
the oily gray surface of the water. 

129 



SPACEMAN! 




It was the first new sight I’d seen in 
many months. The wake was a swirl 
of foam that drifted aft, forming 
a pattern like an ugly face that leer- 
ed up at me through the murky 
water. The face grew clearer, and 
then it broke water, a devil-mask 
of rippling black leaves edged with 
feathery red gills. An arm swept up, 
dripping water; I saw the flash of 
a kpife blade as it swept down 
toward me — and felt the rope fall 
from my neck. A wide hand clamp- 
ed on my arm, tumbled me over the 
stern, and before I could draw ,a 
breath, had dragged me down into 
the cold and the dark. 

I woke up lying on my back in a 
warm, dry place. From the mo- 
tion and the sound, I could tell I 
was on a boat. The air that moved 
over my face carried the sweet, 
clean smell of the sea. 

Fsha-fsha was standing beside the 
bunk. In the soft glow from the 
deck-lamp, his face looked almost 
benign. 

“It’s a good thing I recognized 
you,” I said, and was surprised at 
the weakness of my voice. “I might 
have spoiled things by putting a 
thumb in your eye.” 

“Sorry about the rough treat- 
ment,” he said. “It was the best 
we could work out. The tender- 
master wasn’t in on it; just the boss- 
overseer.” 

“It worked,” I said, and stopped 
to cough, and tasted the alien salt 
water of Drath. 

“We’re not clear yet, but the 
trickiest part went all right. Maybe 
the rest will work out, too.” 



“Where are we headed now?” 
“ There’s a^ abandoned harbor not 
far from here; about four hours’ 
run. A flier will meet us there.” I 
started to ask another question, but 
my eye was too heavy to hold open. 
I closed it and the warm blanket 
of darkness folded in on me. 

V oices woke me. For a moment, 
I was back aboard Lord Desroy’s 
yacht, lying on a heap of uncured 
Nith-hides, and the illusion was so 
strong that I felt a ghostly pang 
from the arm that had been broken 
and mended so long ago. Then Fsha- 
fsha’s voice cut through the dream. 

“ . up now. Danger, have 
to walk a little way. How do you 
feel?” 

I sat up and put my legs over the 
side of the cot and stood. “Like a 
drowned sailor,” I said. “Let’s go.” 
Up on the deck of the little sur- 
face cutter, I could see lights across 
the water. Fsha-fsha had put a heavy 
mackinaw across my shoulders. For 
the first time in a year, I felt cold. 
The engines idled back and we 
swung in beside a jetty. A small, 
furtive-looking Drathian was wait- 
ing beside a battered cargo car. We 
climbed up into the box and settled 
down under some stiff tarpaulins, 
and a moment later the truck start- 
ed up and pulled out in a whine of 
worn turbos.. 

I slept again. The habit of almost 
a year on the rafts, to sleep when- 
ever I wasn’t on the line, was too 
strong to break in an hour; and 
breathing the salt seas of Dfath isn’t 
the best treatment for human lungs. 
When I woke up this time, the car 



T30 



IF 




had stopped. Fsha-fsha put a hand 
on my arm and I lay quiet. Then he 
tapped me and we crawled out and 
slid down the tailgate, and I saw 
we were parked at the edge of the 
spaceport at Drath City. The big 
dome loomed up under the black 
sky, across the ramp, as faded and 
patched as ever; and between us 
and it, the clumsy bulk of an anci- 
ent cargo-carrier squatted on batter- 
ed parking jacks. 

Something moved in the shadows 
and a curiously-shaped creature 
swathed in a long cloak came up to 
us. He flipped back the hood and 
I saw the leathery face of a Rithian. 

“You’re late,” he said unhurriedly. 
“A couple of local gendarmes nos- 
ing about. Best we waste no time.” 
He turned and moved off toward 
the freighter. Fsha-fsha and I fol- 
lowed. We had covered half the dis- 
tance when an actinic-green flood- 
light speared out to etch us in light, 
and a rusty-hinge voice shouted the 
Drathian equivalent of, “Halt or I’ll 
shoot!” 

I ran for it. The Rithian, ten feet 
in the lead, spun, planted himself 
and brought up his arm. A vivid 
orange light winked. The spotlight 
flared and died, and I was past him, 
sprinting for the open cargo port, 
still a hundred yards away across 
open pavement. A gun stuttered from 
off to the right, where the search- 
light had been, and in the crisp yel- 
low flashes I saw Drathian Rule- 
keepers bounding out to intercept 
us. 

I altered course and charged the 
nearest Rule-keeper, hit liim fair 



and square. As he fell, my fingers, 
that had learned to strip the cara- 
pace from a twelve-pound chzik 
with one stroke, found his throat. 
Cartilage crumpled and popped and 
he went limp, and I was back on 
my feet in time to see the other 
Drathian lunge for Fsha-fsha. I took 
him from behind, broke his neck 
with my forearm, lifted him and 
threw him ten feet from me. And we 
were running again. 

The open port was just ahead, a 
brilliant rectangle against the dark 
swell of the hulk. Something gleam- 
ed red there. Fsha-fsha threw him- 
self sideways and a ravening spout 
of green fire 4anced out, and I went 
flat and rolled and saw a giant 
Drathian, his white scrape thrown 
back across his shoulder, swinging 
a flare-muzzled gun around to cover 
me. I came to my feet and drove 
straight at him, but I knew I 
wouldn’t make it — 

Something small and dark plunged 
from the open port, leaped to the 
Drathian’s back. 

He twisted, struck down with the 
butt of the gun, and 1 heard it thud 
on flesh. He struck again, and bone 
crunched, and the smaU, dark thing 
fell away, twisting on the pavement; 
and then I was on the Rule-keeper. 
I caught the gun muzzle, ripped it 
out of his hands, threw it away into 
the dark. His face was coming 
around to me, and I swung with all 
the power that the months of mule- 
labor had given my arm and felt 
the homy mask collapse, saw the 
ochre blood spatter. He went down 
and I stepped over him and the 
small, dark creature moved —

And the light from the entry tell 
across it and showed me the mangled 
body of a H’eeaq. 

Up above, a shrill Rithian voice 
was shouting. Behind me, I heard 
the thud of Drathian feet, their 
sharp, buzzing commands. 

“Srat,” I said, and could say no 
more. Thick, blackish blood welled 
from ghastly wounds. Broken rib- 
ends projected from the warty hide 
of his chest. One great goggle-eye 
was knocked from its socket. The 
other held on me. 

“Master,” the ugly voice croaked. 
“Greatly . my people wronged 
you. Yet if my wounds . may 
atone for yours . forego your 
vengeance ... for they are lonely 
. and afraid . .” 

“Srat! I thought . ” 

“I fought the man. Master,” he 
gasped out. “But he . was stronger 
. then I .... ” 

“Huvile!” I said. “He took the 
ship!” 

Srat made a convulsive move- 
ment. He tried to speak, but only a 
moan came from his crocodile 
mouth. 

I leaned closer. 

“I die. Master,” he said. “Obedi- 
ent ... to your . desires . ” 

XXV 

F sha-fsha and a Rishian crewman 
hauled me aboard the ship. 
Srat’s corpse was left on the ramp. 
Other species aren’t as sentimental 
about such things as men are. 

There were a few angry objec- 
tions from Drath Traffic Control 
as we lifted, but the Drathians had 



long since given up Deep Space 
travel, and ^e loss of a couple of 
runaway slaves wasn’t sufficient rea- 
son to alienate the Rishians. They 
were one of the few worlds that still 
sent tramps into Fringe space. 

Once away, Fsha-fsha told me all 
that had happened since I was sent 
to the rafts: 

“Once you’d planted the idea of 
escape, I had to go ahead with it,” 
he said. “The next chance was three 
months later, two of us this time, 
just one overseer. I had a fancy 
plan worked out for decoying him 
into a side alley, but I had a freak 
piece of luck. It was a loading job, 
and a net broke and scattered cargo 
all over the wharf. The other slave 
got the whole load on his head — 
and a nice-sized iron casting clipped 
the guard and laid him out cold. 
He had the controllers strapped to 
his arm, in plain sight, but getting to 
them was the hardest thing I ever 
did in my life. I used a metal bar 
from the spilled cargo on them and 
fainted at the same time. 

“I came out of it just in time. 
The Lx>ad-master and a couple of 
Rule-keepers were just arriving. I 
got up and ran for it. They wasted 
a little time discovering my control- 
ler was out of action, and by then 
I had a good start. I headed for a 
hideaway I’d staked out earlier, and 
laid up there until dark. 

“That night I came out and took 
a chance on a drinking-house that 
was run by a non-Drathian. I thought 
maybe he’d have a little symapthy 
for a fellow alien. I was wrong, 
but I strapped him to the bed and 
filled both my stomachs with high- 



132 



IF 




lipid food, enough to keep me going 
for two weeks, and took what cash 
he had in the place and got clear. 

“With money to spend, things 
were a little easier. I found a dive 
where I could lie low, no questions 
asked, and sent out feelers for in- 
formation on where you’d been sent. 
The next day the little guy showed 
up: Srat. 

“He’d been hanging around, wait- 
ing for a chance to talk to some- 
one from the Triarch’s stable. I don’t 
know what he’d been eating, but 
it wasn’t much; and he slept in the 
street. 

“I told him what I knew. Be- 
tween us, we got you located. Then 
the Rish ship showed up.” 

The Rishian captain was sitting 
with us, listening. He wrinkled his 
face at me. 

“The H’eeaq, Srat, spoke to me in 
my own tongue, greatly to my as- 
tonishment. Long ago, at Rish, 
I’d heard the tale of the One-eyed 
Man who’d bartered half of the light 
of his world for the lives of his fel- 
lows. The symmetry of the matter 
demanded that I give such a one the 
help he asked.” 

“The little guy didn’t look like 
much,*’ Fsha-fsha said. “But he had 
all the guts there were.” 

“You may take pleasure in the 
memory of that rarest of creatures,” 
the Rishian said, “a loyal slave.” 

“He was something rarer than 
that,” I said. “A friend.” 

F sha-fsha and I stayed with the 
freighter for three months; we 
left her on a world q^led Gloy. We 
could have ridden her all the way 



to Rith, but my destination was tn 
the opposite direction: Zeridajh. 

Fsha-fsha stayed with 'me. One 
world was like another to him, be 
said. As for the ancestral Tree, 
having cut the ties, like a man re- 
covered from an infatuation, he 
wasn’t eager to retie them. The Rish 
captain paid us off for our services 
aboard his vessel — we had rebuilt 
his standby power section, as well 
as pulling regular shifts with the 
crew. That gave us enough cash to 
re-outfit ourselves witii respectable 
clothes and take rooms at a decent 
inn near the port, while we looked 
for a Center-bound berth. 

We had a long wait, but it could 
have been worse. There were shops 
and taverns and apartments built 
among the towering ruins of a vast 
city ten thousand years dead; but 
the ruins were overgrown and soften- 
ed by time, so that the town seemed 
to be built among forested hills, un- 
less you saw it from the air and re- 
alized that the mountains were vine- 
grown structures. 

There was work for us on Gloy. 
By living frugally and saving what 
we earned, we accumulated enough 
for passenger berths inward to 
Tanix, a crossroads world where the 
volume of in-Galaxy shipping was 
more encouraging. After a few days’ 
wait, we signed on a mile-long 
superliner. It was a four months 
cruise. At the end of it we stepped 
off on the soil of a busy trading 
planet, and looked up at the blaze 
of sky that meant Center was close. 

‘Tt’s still three thousand lights 
run to Zeridajh,” the Second Of- 
ficer for Power told me as he paid 



SPACEMANI 



133 




me off. “Why not sign on for an- 
other cruise? Good powermen are 
hard to find. I can offer a bonus.” 

“It’s useless, Second,” Fsha-fsha 
answered for me. “Danger is search- 
ing for a magic flower that only 
grows in one special garden, at the 
hub of the galaxy.” 

After a couple of weeks of job- 
hunting, we signed on as scrapers on 
a Center-bound tub crewed by small, 
damp dandies from the edge of Cen- 
ter. That was the only berth a high- 
brow Center skipper would consider 
handing a barbarian from what they 
called the Outworlds. It was a long 
cruise, and as far as I could tell 
the jobs that fell to a scraper on a 
Center ship were just as dirty as on 
any Outworld tub. 

On our next cruise, we found our- 
selves stranded on a backwater world 
by a broken-down guidance system 
on the rotting hulk we had shipped 
in on. We waited for a berth out- 
bound for a month, then took serv- 
ice under a local constabulary boss 
as mercenaries. We did a lot of 
jumping around the planet, marching 
in ragged jungle and eating of in- 
edible rations, and in the end bare- 
ly got clear with our hides intact 
when the constabulary turned out 
to be a dacoit force. I made one 
interesting discovery. My sorting 
skill came in handy in using the 
bill-hook machetes issued to the 
troops. After one or two small run- 
ins, I had keyed-in a whole set of 
reflex responses that made me as 
good as the battalion champion. 

Usually, though, we didn’t see 
much of the planets we visited. It 
was normal practice, all across the 



Galaxy, ffor a world to channel 
all its spac^ faring commence and 
traffic through a single port, for 
economy of facilities and ease of 
control. The ports I saw were like 
ports in all times and climes: cities 
without personality, reduced to the 
lowest common denominator of the 
thousand breeds of beings they 
served. 

After that, we found another slot, 
and another after that, on a small, 
fast lugger from Thlinthor and on 
that jump we had a change in luck. 

I was sound asleep in the off- 
watch cubbyhole. I rated as a 
scraper when the alarm sirens went 
off. It took me thirty seconds to 
roll out and get across the deck to 
the screens where Fsha-fsha and 
half a dozen other on-watch crew- 
men were gaping at a sight that you 
only see once in a lifetime in Deep 
Space: a derelict hulk, adrift be- 
tween the stars. This one was vast 
— and you could tell at one glance 
that she was old . 

We were five hundred miles 
apart, closing on courses that were 
only slightly skew. That made two 
miracles. We hove to ten miles from 
her and took a good look, while the 
Power Officer conferred with Com- 
mand deck. Then the word came 
through to resume course. 

“Huh?” Both Fsha-fsha and I 
swiveled on him. From the instant 
I’d seen the hulk, visions of prize- 
money had been dancing in my 
head like sugarplums. “He’s not go- 
ing to salvage her?” Fsha-fsha came 
as close to yelling as his mild na- 
ture would let him. 



134 



IF 




The Power Officer gave him a 
fishy face. Like the rest of the 
crew, he AVas an amphibian who 
slept in a tank of salty water for 
three hours at a stretch — and like 
all his tribe, he was an agorophobe 
to the last feathery scale on his 
rudimentary rudder fin. “It ith not 
practical,” he said coldly. 

“That tub’s fifty thousand years 
old if she’s a day,” Fsha-fsha pro- 
tested. “And I’m a mud-puppy if 
she’s not a Riv Surveyor! She’ll be 
loaded with Pre-collapse star maps! 
There’ll be data aboard her that’s 
been lost since before Thlinthor 
lofted her first satellite!” 

“How would you propothe that 
we acthelerate thuch a math as 
that to interthtellar velothity?” he 
put the question to us. “The hulk 
outweighs uth a million to one. 
Our engines were not dethigned for 
thuch thtethes.” 

“She looks intact,” I said. “May- 
be her engines are still in working 
order.” 

“Tho?” 

“We can put a prize crew aboard 
her and bring her in under her 
own power.” 

The Thlinthorian tucked his head 
between his shoulder-plates, his ver- 
sion of a shudder. 

“We Thlinthorians have no tathte 
for thuch exthploiths,” he said. “Our 
mithion is the thafe delivery of 
conthigned cargo.” 

“You don’t have to go out on the 
hull,” Fsha-fsha said. “Danger and 
I will volunteer.” 

e Power Officer goggled his 
eyes at us and conferred with 



Command Deck. After a few min- 
utes of talk word came through that 
his excellency the captain was agree- 
able. 

“One stipulation,” I said. “We’ll 
do the dirty work; but we take a 
quarter-share between us.” 

The captain made a counter of- 
fer of a twentieth-share each. We 
compromised on a tenth. 

I don’t like it,” Fsha-fsha told 
me. “He gave in too easily.” 

We suited up and took a small 
boat across to the old ship. She was 
a glossy brown ovoid about half a 
mile in diameter. Matching up with 
her was like landing on a plane- 
toid. We found a hatch and a set 
of outside controls that let us into 
a dusty cavernous hold. From there 
we went on through passenger quar- 
ters and program rooms. 

In what looked like an armory, 
Fsha-fsha and I looked over a 
treasure-house of sophisticated per- 
sonal offense and defensive devices. 
Everything was in perfect order; 
and nowhere, then or later, did 
we find a bone of her crew or 
any hint of what had happened 
to her. 

A call from the captain on the 
portable communicator reminded 
us sharply that we had a job 
to do. 

We followed a passage big enough 
to drive a moving van through, 
found the engine room, about the 
size of Grand Central Station. The 
generators ranged down the center 
of it were as massive as four-story 
apartment buildings. I whistled when 
saw them, but Fsha-fsha took it in 
stride. 




SPACEMANI 



135 




“I’ve seen bigger,” he said. “Let’s 
check out the system.” 

It took us four hours to work out 
the meaning of the oversized con- 
trols ranged in a circular console 
around a swivel chair the size of a 
bank vault. But the old power 
plant started up with as sweet a 
rumble as if it had been in use ev- 
ery day. 

After a Ittle experimental jockey- 
ing, I got the big bull aligned on 
course coordinates and fed the pow- 
er to the generators. As soon as we 
were up to cruise velocity, his ex- 
cellency the captain ordered us back 
aboard. “Who are you sending over 
to relieve us?” I asked him. 

“You may leave that detail to my 
disorethion,” he told me in no-argu- 
ment tone. 

“I can’t leave this Power Section 
unmanned,” I said. 

He bugged hot eyes at me on the 
four-inch screen of the pocket 
communicator and repeated his or- 
der, louder, with quotations from 
the Universal Code. 

“I don’t like it,” Fsha^fsha said. 
“But I’m afraid we haven’t got 
much choice.” 

B ack aboard the mother ship, our 
reception was definitely cool. 
Word had gotten around that we’d 
pigged an entire share of the goodies. 
That suited me all right. The Hilin- 
thorians weren’t the kind who in- 
spired much in the way of affec- 
tion. 

When we were well inside the 
Thlinthorian system the Pow^ Of- 
ficer called Fsha-fsha and me in 
a smile. 



“I confeth I entertained a ther- 
tain thuthpithion of you both,” he 
confided. ‘®ut now that we have 
arrived in the Home Thystem with 
our thuperb thafely in the thlave 
orbit, I thee that my cauthion was 
exthethive. Gentlemen, join me in 
a drink!” 

We accepted the invitation, and 
he poured out nice-sized tumblers 
of wine. I was just reaching for 
mine when Fsha-fsha jostled the 
table and sloshed wine from the 
glasses. The Power Officer waved 
aside his apologies and turned to 
ring for a mess boy to mop up the 
puddle. In the instant his back was 
turned, Fsha-fsha dropped a small 
pellet in our host’s drink, where it 
dissolved instantly. We all sat smil- 
ing benignly at each other while the 
small Thlinthorian servant mopped 
up, then lifted our glasses and swal- 
lowed. Fsha-fsha gulped his down 
whole. I took a nice swallow of 
mine, nodded my appreciation and 
took another. Our host chugalugged 
and poured another round. We sip- 
ped this one; he watched us and 
we watched him. 

I saw his eyes wander to the time- 
scale on the wall. Fsha-fsha looked 
at it too. 

“How long does it take your stuff 
to work?” he inquired pleasantly of 
the Thlinthorian. 

The latter goggled his eyes, made 
small choking noises, then in a 
strangled voice said: “A quarter of 
an hour.” 

Fsha-fsha nodded, “I can feel it, a 
little,” we said. “We both belted a 
couple of null-pills before we came 
up, just in case you had any fun- 



136 



IF 




ny stuff you wanted to try. How 
do you feel?” 

“Not well.” The fish-mouth swal- 
lowed air. “I cannot control . 
my thpeedh!” 

“Right. Now, tell us all about ev- 
erything. Take your time. It’ll be 
an hour or two before we hit Plan- 
etary Control ...” 

XXVI 

F sha-fsha and I reached the port 
less than ten minutes behind 
the boat we had trailed in from 
where our ship and the Riz vessel 
were parked, a hundred thousand 
miles out. We found the captain 
already at the mutual-congratula- 
tion stage with the portmaster. His 
already prominent eyes nearly rolled 
down his scaled cheeks when he saw 
us. 

“Perhaps the captain forgot to 
mention that he owes Captain Dan- 
ger and myself a tenth share of the 
prize,” Fsha^fsha said, after the in- 
troductions were over. 

“That’s a prepothterouth faith- 
hood” the officer started, but Fsha- 
fsha out him off by producing a 
pocket recorder of a type allow- 
able in every law court in the Bar. 
The scene that followed lacked that 
sense of close comradeship so desir- 
able in captain-crew relationships, 
but there was nothing our former 
commander could do but go along. 

Afterward, in the four-room 
suite we treated ourselves to to 
rest up in, Fsha^sha said, “Ah, by 
the way, Danger, I happened to pick 
up a little souvenir aboard that Riv 
tub.” He did something complicated 



with the groont-hide valise he car- 
ried his personal gear in and took 
out a small packet which opened out 
into a crisscross of flat, black straps 
with a round pillbox in the center. 

“I checked it out,” he said, sound- 
ing like a kid with a new bike. 
“This baby is something. A personal 
body shield. Wear it under your 
tunic. Sets up a field nothing gets 
through I” 

“Nifty,” I agreed, and worked the 
slides on the bottom of my kit bag. 
“I took a fancy to this little jewel.” 
I held up my memento. It was a very 
handsome jeweled wristlet, which 
just fit around my neck. 

“Uh-huh, pretty,” Fsha-fsha. 
said. “This harness of mine is so 
light you don’t know you’re wear- 
ing it — ” 

“It’s not only pretty, it’s a sense 
booster,” I interrupted his paean. “It 
lowers the stimulus/response 
threshold for sight, hearing and 
touch. 

“I guess we out-traded old 
Slinth-face after all,” Fsha-fsha said, 
after we’d each checked out the oth- 
er’s keepsake. “This squares the 
little finesse he tried with the 
sleepy-pills.” 

The salvage authorities made us 
wait around for almost a month, 
but since they were keeping forty 
Thlinthorian crew waiting, too, in 
the end they had to publish the val- 
uation and pay off all hands. Be- 
tween us, Fsha-fsha and I netted 
more .cash than the lifetime earn- 
ings of a spacer. 

We shipped out the same day, a 
short hop to Hrix, a human-occu- 
pied world in a big twenty-seven 



SPACEMAN! 



137 




planet system only half a light from 
Thlinthor. It seemed like a good 
idea not to linger around town after 
the payoff. On Hrix, we shopped for 
a vessel of our own; something 
small, and super-fast. We still had 
over thousand lights to cover. 

H rix was a good place to ship- 
hunt. It had been a major ship- 
building world for a hundred thou- 
sand years, since before the era 
known as the Collapse when the 
original Central Empire folded — 
and incidentally gave the upstart 
tribe called Man his chance to 
spread out over the Galaxy. 

For two weeks we looked at 
brand-new ships, good-as-new sec- 
ond and third and tenth-hand jobs, 
crawled over hulls, poked into pow- 
er sections, kicked figurative tires in 
every shipyard in town, and were 
no farther along than the day we 
started. The last evening Fsha- 
fsha and I were at a table under 
the lanterns swinging from the low 
branches of the Heo trees in the 
drinking garden attached to our inn, 
talking over the day’s frustrations. 

“These new hulls we’ve been 
looking at,” Fsha-fsha said; “mass- 
produced junk; not like the good 
old days.” 

“The old stuff isn’t much either,” 
I countered. “They were built to 
last, and at those crawl-speeds, they 
had to.” 

“Anything we can afford, we 
we don’t want,” Fsha-fsha summed 
it up. “And anything we want, 
costs too much.” 

The landlord who was refilling 
our wine jug spoke up. “If you 
138 



gentlebeings are looking for some- 
thing a little out of the usual line, 
I have dh old grand-uncle — fine 
old chap, full of lore about the old 
times — he’s over three hundred, 
you know — who still dabbles in 
buying and selling. There’s a hull in 
his yard that might be just what 
the sirs are looking for, with a lit- 
tle fixing up — ” 

We managed to break into the 
pitch long enough to find out where 
the ship was, and after emptying 
our jug, took a walk down there. 
It looked like every junkyard I’ve 
ever seen. The place was grown 
with weeds taller than I was, and 
the sales office was a salvaged es- 
cape blister, with flowers growing 
in little clay pots in the old jet 
orifices. There was a light on, 
though, and we pounded until an 
old crookbacked fellow with a wisp 
of pink hair and a jaw like a snap- 
ping turtle poked his head out. We 
explained what we wanted, and who 
had sent us. He cackled and rubbed 
his hands and allowed as how we’d 
come to the right place. By this 
time, we were both thinking we’d 
made a mistake. There was nothing 
here but junk so old that even the 
peimalloy was beginning to corrode. 
But we followed him back between 
towering stacks of obsolete parts 
and assemblies, over heaps of warp- 
ed hull-plates, through a maze of 
stacked atmosphere fittings to what 
looked like a thicket dense enough 
for Bre’r Rabbit to hide in. 

“If you sirs’ll just pull aside a 
few tendrils of that danged wire 
vine,” the old boy suggested. Fsha- 
fsha had his mouth open to decline, 

IF 




but out of curiosity I started strip- 
ping away a finger-thick creeper, 
and back in the green-black gloom 
I saw a curve of dull-polished metal. 
Fsha-fsha joined in, and in five 
minutes we had uncovered the 
stern of what had once been ele- 
gance personified. 

“She was built by Sanjio,” the 
oldster told us. “See theref’ He 
pointed at an ornate emblem, still 
jewel bright against the tarnished 
metal. Fsha-fsha ran his hand over 
curve of the boat’s flank, peered 
along the slim-lined hull. Our eyes 
met. 

“How much?” he said. 

“You’ll put her in shape, restore 
her,” the old man said. “You would 
not cut her up for the heavy metal 
in her jump fields, or convert her 
for rock-prospecting.” It was a ques- 
tion. We both yelled no loud enough 
to satisfy him. 

The old man nodded. “I like you 
boys’ looks,” he said. “I wouldn’t 
sell her to just anybody. She’s 
yours.” 

I t took us a day to «ut the boat 
free of the growth that had been 
crawling over for eighty years. 
The old man, whose name was 
Knoute, managed, with curses and 
pleas and some help from a half- 
witted lad named Dune, to start up 
a long-defunct yard-tug and move 
the boat into a cleared space big 
enough to give us access to her. 
Fsha-fsha and I went through her 
from stem to stern. 

She was complete, original right 
down to the old log book still ly- 
ing in the chart table. It gave us 
140 



some data to do further research 
on this evening at dinner and read 
the boat’s oif. I spent an afternoon 
in the shipping archieves in the city, 
and that history to Fsha-fsha: 

*'Gleerim, fifty-five feet, one 
hundred and nine tons. Built by 
Sanjio, Master builder to Prince 
Ahax, as color-bearer to the Great 
House, in the year Qon ...” 

“That would be just over four 
thousand years ago,” Knoute put 
in. 

“In her maiden year, the Prince 
Ahax raced her at Poylon and at 
Gael, and led a field of thirty-two 
to win at Fonteraine. In her for- 
tieth year, with a long record of 
brilliant victories affixed to her 
crest-plate, the boat was sold at 
auction by the hard-pressed and 
aged prince. Purchased by a Vidian 
leader, she was passed on to the 
Solarch of Trie, whose chief of staff, 
recognizing the patrician lines of the 
vessel, refitted her as his personal 
scout. Captured nineteen years la- 
ter in a surprise raid by the Al- 
zethi, the boat was mounted on a 
wooden-wheeled platform and haul- 
ed by chained dire-beasts in a tri- 
umphal procession through the 
streets of Alz. Thereafter, for more 
than a century, the boat lay aban- 
doned on her rotting cart at the 
edge of the noisome town. 

“Greu of Balgreu found the for- 
gotten boat, and set a crew to cut- 
ting her out of her bed of tangled 
wildwood. Fancying the vessel’s 
classic lines, the invading chieftain 
removed her to a field depot, where 
his shipfitters hammered in vain at 
her locked port. Greu himself hack- 

IF 




ed at her crestplate, desiring it as 
an ornament, but succeeded only in 
shattering his favorite dress short- 
sword. In his rage, he ordered flam- 
mable rubble to t>e heaped on the 
boat, soaked with volatiles and 
fired. After he razed the city and 
departed with his troops, the boat 
again lay in neglect for two cen- 
turies. Found by the Imperial Sur- 
vey Team of his Effulgent majesty, 
Lleon the Fortieth, she was return- 
ed to Ahax, where she was refitted 
and returned to service as color- 
bearer to the imperial house.” 
“That was just her first days,” 
Knoute said. “She’s been many 
places since then, seen many sights. 
And the vessel doesn’t exist to this 
day that can outrun her.” 

It took us three months to re- 
pair, refit, clean, polish, tune and 
equip the boat to suit ourselves and 
old Knoute. But in the end even he 
had to admit that Prince Ahax him- 
self couldn’t have done her more 
proud. And when the time came to 
pay him, he graciously waved the 
money aside. 

“I won’t live to spend it,” he said. 
“And you boys have bled yourselves 
white, doing her up. You’ll need 
what you’ve got left to cruise her 
as she should be cruised, wanting 
nothing. Take her, and see that the 
lines you add to her log, don’t 
shame her history.”

T wo thousand light-years is a 
goodly distance, even when you 
are riding the raveniag stream of

of the fabric of the continuum and 
converted to acceleration that flung 
us inward at ten, a hundred, a 
thousand times the velocity of prop- 
agation of radiation. We covered 
the distance in jumps of a month 
or more, while the blaze of stars 
thickened across the skies ahead 
like clotting cream. We saw worlds 
where intelligent life had existed 
for thousands of centuries, planets 
that were the graveyards of cultures 
older than the dinosaurs of Earth. 
When our funds ran low, we made 
the discovery that even at the heart 
of the galaxy, there were people 
who would pay us a premium for 
fast delivery of passengers and 
freight. 

Along the way we encountered 
life-forms that ranged from intelli- 
gent gnat-swarms to the titanic 
slumbering swamp-minds of Bu- 
room. We found men on a hundred 
worlds, some rugged pioneers bare- 
ly holding their own against a hos- 
tile environment of ice or desert or 
competing flora and faima, others 
the polished and refined product 
of millenia-old empires that had 
evolved cultural machinery as for- 
mal and complex as a lifelong bal- 
let. There were worlds where we 
were welcomed to cities made of 
jade and crystal, and worlds where 
sharpers with faces like Neapoli- 
tan street-urchins plotted to rob 
and kill us; but our Riv souvenirs 
served us well, and a certain in- 
stinct for survival got us through. 

And the day came when Zeridajh 
swam onto our forward screens, a 
misty green world with two big 
moons. 

141 




T he Port of Radaj was a multi- 
level composition of gardens, 
pools, trees, glass-smooth paving, 
sculpture-clean facades, with the 
transient shipping parked on dis- 
persed pads like big toys set out 
for play. Fsha-fsha and I dressed up 
in our best shore-going clothes and 
rode a toy train in to a country- 
club style terminal. 

The landing formalities were 
minimal. A gray-haired smoothie 
who reminded me of an older Sir 
Orfeo welcomed us to the planet, 
handed us illuminated handmaps 

that showed us our position as a 
moving point of green light and 
asked how he could be of service. 

“I’d like to get news of some- 
one,” I told him. “A Lady — the 
Lady Raire.” 

“Of what house?” 

“I don’t know; but she was 

traveling in the company of Lord 

Desroy.” 

He directed us to an informa- 
tion center that turned out to be 
manned by a computer. After a few 
minutes of dose questioning and a 
display of triograms, the machine 
voice advised me that the lady I 
sought was of the house of Anci- 
net-Ohanore, and that an interview 
with the head of the house would 
be my best bet for further informa- 
tion. 

“But is she here?” I pressed the 
point. “Did she get back home safe- 
ly?” 

The computer repeated its advice 
and added that transportation was 
available outside gate twelve. 

We, crossed the wide floor of the 
terminal and came out on a plat- 
142 



form where a gorgeous scarlet and 
silver inlaid porcelain car waited. 
We climbed' in, and a discreet voice 
whispered an inquiry as to our des- 
tination. 

“The Ancinet-Chanore estate,” I 
told it, and it clicked and whooshed 
away along a curving, soaring ave- 
nue that lofted us high above wood- 
ed hills and rolling acres of lawn 
with glass-smooth towers in pastel 
colors pushing up among the crowns 
of multi-thousand year-old Heo 
trees. 

After a fast halfihour run, the 
car swooped down an exit ramp and 
pulled up in front of an imposing 
gate. A gray-liveried man on duty 
there asked us a few questions, 
played with a console inside his 
glass-walled cubicle and advised us 
that the Lord Pastaine was at leis- 
ure and would be happy to grant us 
an interview. 

“Sounds like a real VIP,” Fsha- 
fsha commented as the car tooled 
up the drive and deposited us* at the 
edge of a terrace fronting a sculp- 
tured facade. 

“Maybe it’s just a civilized 
world,” I suggested. 

Another servitor in gray greeted 
us and ushered us inside, through a 
wide hall where sunlight slanting 
down through a faceted ceiling shed 
a rosy glow on luminous wood and 
brocaded hangings, winked from 
polished sculptures perched in shad- 
owy recesses. And I thought of the 
Lady Raire, coming from this, liv- 
ing in a cave grubbed out of a dirt 
bank, singing to herself as she plant- 
ed wild flowers along the paths. 

We came out into a patio, cross- 

IF 




ed that and went along a colonnad- 
ed arcade, enoierged at the edge of 
a stretch of blue-violet grass as 
smooth as a billiard table, running 
down across a wide slope to a line 
of trees with the sheen of water be- 
yond them. We followed a tiled 
path beside flowering shrubs, round- 
ed a shallow pool where a fountain 
jetted liquid sunshine into the air 
and arrived at a small covered ter- 
race, where a vast, elderly man 
with a face like a clean-shaven 
Moses rested in an elaborately pad- 
ded chair. 

4^'^r^he Lord Pastaine,” the ser- 

' A vant said casually and step- 
ped to adjust the <^gle of the old 
gentleman’s chair to a more con- 
versational position. 

Its occupant looked us over im- 
passively. He said, “Thank you, 
Dos,” and indicated a pair of bench- 
es next to him. I introduced myself 
and Fsha-fsha and we sat. Dos mur- 
mured an offer of refreshment and 
we asked for a light wine. He went 
away and Lord Pastaine gave me a 
keen glance. 

“A man from a very distant 
world,” he said. “A man who is no 
stranger to violence.” His look 
turned to Fsha-fsha. “And a being 
equally far from his home world, 
tested also in the crucible of ad- 
versity.” He pushed his lips out and 
looked thoughtful. “And what brings 
such adventurers here to ancient 
Zeridajh, to call upon an aged idler, 
dozing away the long afternoon of 
his life?” 

“I met a Lady once. Milord,” I 
said. “She was a long way from 
SPACEAAANI 



home — as far as I am, now, from 
mine. I tried to help her get home, 
but . things went wrong;” I’d 
like to know, sir, if the Lady Raire 
is here, safe, on Zeridajh.” 

His face changed, turned to 
wood. “The Lady Raire?” His 
voice had a thin, strained quality. 
“What do you know of her?” 

“I was hired by Sir Orfeo,” I 
said. “To help on the hunt. There 
was an accident ...” I gave him 
a brief account of the rest of the 
story. “I tried to find a lead to the 
H’eeaq,” I finished. “But with no 
luck.” It was on the tip of my 
tongue to tell him the rest, about 
Huville and the glimpse I’d gotten 
of her, three years before on Drath; 
but for some reason I didn’t say it. 
The old man watched me all the 
while I talked. Then he shook his 
head. 

“I am sorry, sir,” he said, “that 
I have no good tidings for you.” 
“She never came back, then?” 
His mouth worked. He started to 
speak, twice, then said, “No! The de- 
voted child whom I knew was spir- 
ited away by stealth by those whom 
I trusted, and never returned!” 

I let that sink in. The golden 
light across the wide lawn seemed 
to fade suddenly to a tawdry glare. 
The vision of the empty years rose 
up in front of me. 

“ . send out a search expedi- 
tion,” Fsha-fsha was saying. “It 
might be possible — ” 

“The Lady Raire is dead!” The 
old man raised his voice. “Dead! Let 
us speak of other matters!” 

The servant brought the wine, 
and I tried to sip mine and make 

143 




small talk, but it wasn't a success. 
Across the lawn a servant in neat 
gray livery was walking a leashed 
animal along a path that sparkled 
blood-red in the afternoon sun. The 
animal didn’t seem to like the idea 
of a stroll. He planted all four feet 
and pulled backwards. The man 
stopped and mopped at his fore- 
head while the reluctant pet sat on 
his haunches and yawned. 

When he did that, I was sure. I 
hadn’t seen a cat for almost three 
years, but I knew this one. His 
name was Eureka. 

xxvm 

T en minutes later, as Fsha-fsha 
and I crossed the lawn toward 
the house, a broad-shouldered man 
with curled gray hair and an ele- 
gantly simple tunic emerged from a 
side path ahead. 

“You spoke to his Lordship of 
Milady Raixe?” he said in a low 
voice as we came up. 

“That’s right.” 

He jerked his head toward the 
house. “Come along to where we 
can talk quietly. Peihaps we can 
exchange information to our mu- 
tual advantage.” 

He led us by back passages into 
the deep, coil gloom of a room fit- 
ted up like an office for a plane- 
tary president. He told us his name 
was Sir Tanis, and got out a flag- 
on and glasses and poured a round. 

“The girl reappeared three months 
ago,” he said. “Unfortunately,” he 
added solemnly, “she is quite in- 
sane. Her first act was to disavow 
all hfr most hallowed obligations to 
144 , 



the house of Ancient-Chanore. Now, 
I gather from the few scraps of ad- 
vice that reached my ears — ” 
“Dos t^ks as well as listens, I 
take it,” I said. 

“A useful man,” Sir Tanis agreed 
crisply. “As I was saying, I de- 
duce that you know something of 
Milady’s activities while away from 
home. Perhaps you can tell me 
something which might explain the 
sad disaffection that afflicts her.” 
“Why did Lord Pastaine lie to 
us? I countered. 

“The old man is in his dotage,” 
he snapped. “Perhaps in his mind 
she is dead.” His slips quirked in a 
mirthless smile. “He’s unused to re- 
bellion among the very young.” The 
brief smile dropped. “But she didn’t 
stop with asserting her contempt for 
his lordship’s doddering counsels; 
she spurned as well the advices of 
her most devoted friends!” 
“Advices on what?” 

“Family matters,” Tanis said 
shortly. “But you were about to tell 
me what’s behind her incompre- 
hensible behavior.” 

“Was I?’ 

“I assmned as much. I confided 
in you!” Tanis looked thwarted. 
“See here, if it’s a matter of, ah, 
compensation for services render- 
ed ... ” 

“Maybe you’de better give me a 
little more background.” 

H e looked at me sternly. “As you 
are doubtless aware, the House 
of Ancinet-Chanore is one of the 
most distinguished on the planet,” 
he said. “We trace our lineage back 
through eleven thousand years, to 

IF 




Lord of Ancient Traviai. Naitunally 
such a house enjoys a deserved pre- 
eminence among its peers. And the 
head of that house must <be an in- 
dividual of the very highest attain- 
ments. Why — ” he looked indig- 
nant — “if the Seat passed to any- 
one but myself, in a generation — 
less I — we should deteriorate to 
the status of a mere fossil, lacking 
in all finesse in the arts that mark a 
truly superior Seat!” 

“What’s the Lady Raire got to 
do with all that?” 

“Surely you’re aware. Why else 
are you here?” 

“Pretend we’re not.” 

“The girl is an orphan,” Sir Tanis 
said shortly. “Of the Primary Line. 
In addition — ” he sounded exas- 
perated — “all the collateral heirs 
— all! — are either dead, exiled 
or otherwise disqualified in the vot- 
ing!” 

“So?” 

“She — a mere girl, utterly lack- 
ing in experience — other than what- 
ever bizarre influences she may 
have come under during her ab- 
sence — holds in her hands five 
ballots! Five, out of nine! She — 
ineligible herself, of course, on a 
number of counts — controls the 
selectiqp of the next Head of this 
House! Why else do you imagine 
she was kidnapped?” 

“Kidnapped?” 

He nodded vigorously. “And 
since her return, she’s not only re- 
buffed my most’ cordial offers of 
association but has alienated every 
other conceivable candidate as well.” 
He lowered his voice. “In fact, it’s 
my personal belief the girl intends 
SPACEMANI 



to lend her support to an Outsider!” 
“Sir Tanis, I guess all this family 
politics business is pretty interest- 
ing to you, but it’s over my head 
like a wild pitch. I came here to see 
Milady Raire, to find out if she was 
safe and well. First I’m told she’s 
dead, then that she’s lost her mind. 
I’d like to see myself. If you could 
arrange — ” 

“No,” he said flatly. “That is 
quite impossible.” 

“May I ask why?” 

“Sir Revenat would never allow 
it. He closets her as closely as a 
prize breeding soumU* 

“And who’s Sir Revenat?” 

He raised his eyebrows. “Her 
husband,” he said. 

4 Fsha^fsha consoled 

me as we walked along the 
echoing corridor, following the ser- 
vant Sir Tanis had assigned to lead 
us back into the outside world. “Not 
much joy there. But at least she’s 
home, and alive.” 

We crossed an inner court where 
a fountain made soft music. A door 
opened along the passage ahead. An 
elderly woman, thin, tight-oorseted, 
dressed in a chiton of shimmering 
white, spoke to the servant, who 
faded away like smoke. She turned 
and looked at me with sharp eyes, 
studied Fsha-fsha’s alien face. 

“You’ve come to help her,” she 
said to him in a dry, husky voice. 
“You know, and you’ve come to 
her aid.” 

“Ah . whose aid, Milady?” he 
asked her. 

The old lady grimaced and said: 
“The Lady Raire’s. She’s in mor- 

145 




tal danger; that’s why her father 
ordered her sent away, on his death- 
bed! But none will believe me.” 
“What kind of damger is she in?” 
“I don’t know — but it’s there, 
thick in the air around her! Poor 
child, so all alone.” 

“Milady.” I stepped forward. 
“I’ve come a long way. I want to 
see her before I go. Can you ar- 
range it?” 

“Of course, you fool, else why 
would I have lain here in wait like 
a mud-roach over a wine-arbor?” 
She returned her attention to Fsha- 
fsha. “Tonight — at the Gathering 
of the House. Milady will be pres- 
ent; even Sir Revenat wouldn’t dare 
defy custom so far as to deny her; 
and you shall be there, too! Listen! 
This is what you must do ... ” 

H alf an hour later, we were walk- 
ing along a tiled street of 
craftsmen’s shops that was worn to 
a pastel smoothness that blended 
with the soft-toned facades that 
lined it. There were flowers in beds 
and rows and urns and boxes, and 
in hanging trays that filtered the 
early light over open doorways 
where merchants fussed over dis- 
plays of goods. I could smell fresh- 
baked bread and roasting coffee, 
and leather and wood-smoke. It 
was an atmosphere that made the 
events inside the ancient House of 
Ancinet-Chanore seem like an after- 
noon with the Red Queen. 

“If you ask me, the whole bunch 
of them is round the bend,” Fsha- 
fsha said. “I think the old lady 
had an idea I was in touch with the 
spirit world.” 

146 



On a bench in front of a carpen- 
ter’s stall, a man sat tapping with 
a mallet and chisel at a slab of 
tangerine-colored wood. He looked 
up and grinned at me. 

“As pretty a bit of emberwood as 
ever a man laid steel to, eh?” he 
said. 

“Strange,” Fsha-fsha said. “You 
only see hand laibor on backward' 
worlds and rich ones. On all the 
others, a machine would be squeez- 
ing a gob of plastic into whatever 
shape was wanted.” 

In another stall, an aged woman 
was looming a rug of rich-colored 
fibers. Across the way, a boy sat 
in an open doorway, polishing what 
looked like a second-hand silver 
chalice. Up ahead, I saw the tailor 
shop the old woman — Milady Be- 
zaille, her name was — had told 
us about. An old fellow with a face 
like an elf was rolling out a bolt of 
green cloth with a texture like 
hand-rubbed metal. He looked up 
and ducked his head as we came in. 
“Ah, the sirs desire a change of cos- 
tume?” 

Fsha-fsha was already feeling the 
green stuff. “How about an outfit 
made of this?” 

“Ah, the being has an eye,” the 
old fellow cackled. “Radiant, is it 
not? Loomed by Y’sallo, of course.” 

I picked out a black like a slice 
of midnight in the Fringe. The tailor 
flipped up the end of the material 
and whirled it around my shoulders, 
stepped back and studied the effect 
thoughtfully. 

“I see the composition as an ex- 
pression of experience,” he nodded. 
“Yes, it’s possible. Stark, unadorned 

IF 




— but for the handsome necklace. 
Riv work, is it not? Yes, a statement 
of self-affirmation, an incitement to 
discipline.” 

He went to work measuring and 
clucking. When he started cutting, 
we crossed a small bridge to a park 
where there were tables on the lawn 
beside a small lemon-yeUow dome. 
We sat and ate pastries and then 
went along to a shoemaker, who 
sliced into glossy hides and in an 
hour had fitted new boots to both of 
us. When we got back to the tailor 
shop, the new clothes were waiting; 
We asked directions to a refresher 
station, and after an ion-haith and 
a little attention to my hair and 
Fsha-fsha’s giU fringes, tried out our 
new costumes. 

“You’re an impressive figure,” 
Fsha-fsha said admiringly. “In spite 
of your decorations, your size and 
muscular development give you a 
certain animal beauty; and I must 
say the little tailor set you off to best 
advantage.” 

“The high collar helps,” I con- 
ceded. “But I’m afraid the eye-patch 
spoils the effect.” 

“Wrong. It enhances the impres- 
sion of an elegant corsair.” 

“Well, if the old Tree could see 
you now, it would have to admit 
you’re the fanciest nut that ever 
dropped off it,” I said. 

It was twilight in the parklike city. 
We still had an hour to kill, and 
decided to use it in a stroll around 
the Old Town — the ancient market 
place that was the original center of 
the city. It was a picturesque place, 
and we were just in time to see the 
merchants folding up their stalls, and 



streaming away to the drinking ter- 
races under the strung ligjhits among 
the trees. The sun set in a glory of 
painted clouds; the bnUiant spread 
of stars that covered the sky lake 
luminous clotted cream was obscur- 
ed by the overcast. The empty streets 
dimmed into deep shadow, as we 
turned our steps toward the gates 
of the estate Ancinet-Chanore. 

XXIX 

M y sense booster was set at 1.3 
normal; any higher setting 
made ordinary sound and light levels 
painful. For the last hundred feet I 
had been listening to the gjuey 
wheeze that was the sound of hunMn 
lungs, coming from somewhere up 
ahead. I touched Fsha-fsha’s aim 
“In the alley,” I said softly. “Just 
one man.” 

He stepped ahead of me, and in 
the same instant a small, lean figure 
sprang into view twenty feet ahead^ 
stopped in a half-crouch facing us, 
with his feet planted wide and his 
gun hand up and aimed. I saw a 
lightning-wink and heard the soft 
whap of a filament pistol. Fsha- 
fsha oofed as he took the bolt square 
in the chest; a corona outlined his 
figure in vivid blue as the harness 
bled the energy off to the ground. 
Then he was on the assassin; his 
arm rose and fell with the sound of 
a hammer hitting a grapefruit, and 
the would-be killer tumbled back- 
ward and slid down the wall to 
sprawl on the pavement. I went flat 
against the wall, flipped the booster 
up to max, heard nothing but the 
normal night sounds of a city.

“Clear,” I said. Fsha-fsha leaned 
over the little man. 

“I hit him too hard,” he said. 
“He’s dead.” 

“Maybe the old lady was right,” 
I said. 

“Or maybe Sir Tanis wasn’t as 
foolish as he sounded,” Fsha-fsha 
grunted. “Or Milord Pastaine as sen- 
ile as they claimed.” 

“A lot of maybes,” I said. “Let’s 
dump him out of sight and get out 
of here, in case a cleanup squad is 
following.” 

We lifted him and tossed him in 
the narrow passage he had picked 
as a hiding place. 

“Which way?” Fsha-fsha asked. 

“Straight ahead, to the main 
gates,” I said. 

“You’re still going there — after 
this?” 

“More than ever. Somebody made 
a mistake, sending a hit man out. 
They made a second not making it 
stick. We’ll give them a chance to 
go for three.” 

T^he Lady BezaUle had given in- 
' X struction to the gatekeeper; he 
bowed us through like visiting roy- 
alty into an atmosphere of lights 
and sounds and movement. The 
grand celebration known as the 
Gathering of the House seemed to 
be going on all over the grounds and 
throughout the house. We made our 
way through the throngs of beauti- 
ful people, looking for a familiar 
face. Sir Tanis popped up and gave 
a lifted-eyebrow look, but there 
wasn’t enough surprise there to 
make him the man behind the assas- 
sination attempt. 



“Captain Danger; Sir Fsha-fsha; I 
confess I didn’t expect to see you 
here.” He was aching to ask by 
whose order we were included in the 
select gathering, but apparently his 
instinct for the oblique approach 
kept nim from the direct question. 

“It seemed the least I coidd do,” 
I said in what I hoped was a cryptic 
tone. Has Milady Raire arrived yet?” 
“Ha! She and Lord Revenat will 
make a dramatic entrance after the 
rest of us have been allowed to con- 
sume ourselves in restless patience 
for a time, you can be sure.” 

He led us to the nearest refresh- 
ment server, which dispensed foamy 
concoctions in big tulip glasses. We 
stood on the lawn, fencing with him 
verbally for a few minuites, then 
parted with an implied understand- 
ing that whatever happened, our 
weight would go to the side of Jus- 
tice — whatever that meant. 

Milady Bezaille appeared, looked 
us over and gave a sniff that seemed 
to mean approval of our new fin- 
ery. I had a feeling she’d regrettecr 
her earlier rash impulse of inviting 
two space tramps to the Grand 
Soiree of the year. 

“Look sharp, now,” she cautioned 
me. “When Milord Revenat designs 
to appear he’ll be swamped at once 
with attention of certain unwhole- 
some elements of the House. That 
will be your chance to catch a 
glimpse of Milady Raire. See if you 
read in her face other than pain 
and terror!” 

A slender, dandified lad sauntered 
over after the beldame had 
whisked away.

“I see the noble lady is attempting 
to influence you,” he said. “Beware 
of her, sirs. She is not of sound 
mind.” 

“She was just tipping us off that 
the punch in number three bowl is 
spiked with hand-blaster pellets,” I 
assured him. He gave me a quick, 
sideways look. 

“What, ah, did she say to you 
about Sir Fane?” 

“Ah-hah!” I nodded. 

“Don’t believe it!” he snapped. 
“Lies! Damnable lies!” 

I edged closer to him. “What 
about Sir Tanis?” I muttered. 

He shifted his eyes. “Watch him. 
All his talk about unilateral revis- 
ionism and ancillary line vigor — 
pure superstition.” 

“And Lord Revenat?” 

He looked startled. “You don’t 
mean — ” He turned and scuttled 
away without finisihing the sentence. 

“Danger — are you sure this is 
the right place we’re in?” Fsha-fsha 
whispered. “If the Lady Raire is any- 
thing like the rest of this mena- 
gerie ...” 

“She isn’t,” I said. 

I stopped talking as a stir ran 
through the little conversational 
groups around us. 

Across the lawn a servant in crim- 
son livery was towing a floating 
floodlight along above the heads of 
a couple just descending a wide, 
shallow flight of steps from a land- 
ing terrace above. I hadn’t seen the 
heli arrive. The man was tall, wide- 
shouldered, trim, like all Zerida- 
jhans, dressed in a form-ftting wine- 
colored outfit with an elaborate pec- 
toral ornament suspended around 



his neck on a chain. The woman be- 
side Him was slim, elegantly gowned 
in silvery gauze, with her black hair 
piled hi^, intricately entwined in a 
jeweled coronet. 

I’d never seen her in jewels be- 
fore. But that perfect face, set in 
an expression that was the absence 
of all expression, was that of Milady 
Raire. 

T he crowd moved in their direc- 
tion as if by a common impulse 
to rush up and greet the newcomers; 
but the movement halted and the 
restless murmur of chatter resumed, 
but with a new, nervous note that 
was evident in the shrill cackle of 
laughter and the over-hearty waving 
of arms. I made my way across 
through the crowd, watching the cir- 
cle of impressively clad males col- 
lecting around the newcomers. They 
moved off in a body, with a great 
deal of exuberant joking that sound- 
ed about as sincere as a losing poli- 
tician’s congratulatory telegram to 
the winner. 

I trailed along at a distance of 
ten yards, while the group swirled 
around a drink dispenser and broke 
up into a central group and half a 
dozen squeezed-out satellites. The 
lucky winners steered their prize on 
an evasion course, dropping a few 
members along the way when clum- 
sy footwork involved them in ex- 
changes of amenities with other, less 
favored groups. In five minutes, the 
tall man in the burgundy tights was 
fenced into a comer by half a dozen 
hardy victors, while the lady in silver 
stood for the moment alone at a 
few yards distance.

I looked at her pale, aloof face, 
still as youthful and unline d as it had 
been seven years ago, when we last 
talked together under the white sun 
of Gar 28. I took a deep breath and 
started across the lawn toward her. 

She didn’t notice me until I was 
ten feet from her; then she turned 
slowly and her eyes went across me 
as coolly as the first breath *of win- 
ter. They came back again, and this 
time flickered — and held on me. 
Suddenly I was conscious of the 
scar, two-thirds concealed by the 
high collar of my jacket, that mark- 
ed the comer of my jaw — and of 
the black patch over my right eye. 
Her eyes moved over me, back to 
my face. They widened. Her lips 
parted, then I was standing before 
her. 

“Milady Raire,” I said, and heard 
the hoarse note in my voice. 

“Can . can it be you?” Her 
voice was the faintest of whispers. 

A hard hand took my arm, spun 
me ground. 

do not believe, sir,” a furious 
voice snarled, “that you have the 
privilege of approach to Her Lady- 
ship!” 

He got that far before his eyes 
took in what they were looking at; 
his voice trailed off. His mouth hung 
open. He dropped my arm and took 
a step back. It was the man named 
Huvile. 

XXX 

4^Qir Revenat,” someone started, 

i^and let it drop. I could almost 
hear his mind racing, looking for 
the right line to take. But nobody. 



even someone who had only talked 
to me for five minutes three years 
before, could pretend to have for- 
gotten my face: black-skinned, scar- 
red, one-eyed. 

“It . it . I . .” 

“Sir Revenat,” I said as smoothly 
as I could under the circumstances, 
and gave him a stiff little half-bow. 
That passed the ball to him. He 
could play it any way he liked from 
there. 

“Why, why — ” He took my arm, 
in a gentler grip this time. “My dear 
fellow! What an extraordinary pleas- 
ure!” His eyes went to Milady 
Raire. She returned a look as im- 
personal as the carved face of a 
statue. She didn’t look at me. 

“If you will excuse us. Milady.” 
Huvile/Revenat ducked his head and 
hustled me past her, and the silent 
crowd parted to let us through. 

I nside a white damask room with 
a wall of glass through which the 
lights of the garden cast a soft poly- 
chrome glow, Huvile faced me. He 
looked a little different than he had 
the last time I had seen him, wear- 
ing the coarse kilt of a slave in the 
household of the Triarch of Drath. 
He had lost the gaunt look and was 
trimmed, manicured and polished 
like a prize-winning boar. 

“You’ve changed,” he said. “For 
a moment, I almost failed to recog- 
nize you.” His voice was hearty 
enough, but his eyes were as alert 
as a coiled rattler. 

I nodded. “A year on the Tri- 
arch’s rafts have that effect.” 

“The rafts?” He looked shocked. 
“But . but . .”

IF 




“The penalty for freeing slaves,” 
I said. “And not being able to pay 
the fines.” 

“But ... I assumed ...” 
“Everything I owned was on my 
boat,” I said. 

His face was turning darker, as 
if pressure was building up beMnd 
it. “Your boat . I . ah . .” 
He made an effort to get hold of 
himself. “See here, didn’t you direct, 
ah, the young woman to lift ship at 
once?” His look told me he was 
waiting to see if I’d pick up the im- 
personal reference to the Lady Raire. 
I shook my head and waited. 

“But she arrived a moment or 
two after I reached the port. You 
did send her?” 

“Yes.” 

“Of course,” he hurried on. “She 
seemed most distraught, poor crea- 
ture. I explained to her that a kindly 
stranger — yourself — had purchas- 
ed my freedom, and presumably hers 
as well. And while we spoke, a crea- 
ture appeared. A ghastly-looking lit- 
tle beggar. The unfortunate girl was 
terrified by the sight of him; I drove 
the thing off, and then . and then 
she insisted that we lift at once!” 
Huvile shook his head, looking 
grieved. “I understand now. In her 
frenzy to make good her escape, 
she abandoned you, her unknown 
savior.” A thought hit him, sharp- 
ened his eyes. “You hadn’t, ah, per- 
sonally known the poor child?” 

“I saw her for a moment at the 
Triarch’s palace — from a distance.” 
He sighed. His look got more 
comfortable. “A tragedy that your 
kindness was rewarded by such in- 
gratitude. Believe me, sir, I am eter- 



nally in your debt! I acknowledge 
it freely,” He lowered his voice. 
“But let us keep the details in con- 
fidence, between us. It would not 
be desirable at this moment to in- 
troduce a new factor into the some- 
what complex equation of House af- 
fairs.” He was getting expansive 
now. “We shouldn’t like my ability 
to reward you as you deserve to suf- 
fer through any fallacious construc- 
tion that might be put on matters, 
eh?” 

“I take it you took the female 
slave under your wing,” I said. 

He gave me a sharp look. He 
would have liked her left out of the 
conversation. 

“She would have needed to get 
home,” I amplified. 

“Ah, yes, I think I see now,” 
he smiled a sad, sweet smile. “You 
were taken with her beauty. But 
alas — ” his eyes held on mine — 
“she died.” 

4 4''T^hat’s very sad,” I said. “How 
A did it happen?” 

“My friend, wouldn’t it be bet- 
ter to forget her? Who knows what 
terrible pressures might not have 
influenced her to the despicable 
course she chose? Poor waif, she 
suffered greatly. Her death gave her 
surcease.” His expression got brisk. 
“And now, in what way can I serve 
you, sir? Tell me how I can make 
amends for the injustice done you.” 

He talked some more, offered me 
the hospitality of the estate, a meal, 
even, delicately, money. His relief 
when I turned them down was ob- 
vious. Now that he saw I wasn’t go- 
ing to be nasty about the little mis-

understanding, his confidence was 
coming back. I let him ramble on. 
When he ran down, I said: 

“How about an introduction to 
the lady in silver? The Lady Raire, 
I understand her name is.” 

His face went hard. “This is im- 
possible. The lady is not well. 
Strange faces upset her.” 

“Too bad,” I said. “In that case, 
I guess there’s not much for me to 
stay around for.” 

“Must you go? But of course 
if you have business matters re- 
quiring your attention, I mustn’t 
keep you.” He went across to an 
archway leading toward the front 
of the house; he was so eager to 
get rid of me the easy way that he 
almost fell down getting there. He 
didn’t realize I’d turned the oppo- 
site way and stepped back out onto 
the terrace until I was already across 
it and headed across the lawn to 
where Milady Raire still stood alone, 
like a pale statue in the winking light 
of an illuminated fountain. 

S he watched me come across the 
the lawn to her. I could hear 
the hurrying footsteps of Sir Rev- 
enat behind me, not quite running, 
heard someone intercept him, the 
babble of self-important voices. I 
walked up to her and my eyes held 
on her face. It was as rigid as a 
death mask. 

“Milady, what happened after you 
left Drath?” I ask^ her without 
preamble. 

“I — ” she started and her eyes 
showed shock. “Then — on Drath 
— it was you!” 

“You’re scared. Milady. They're 



all scared of Huvile, but you most 
of all. Tell me why.” 

“Billy Danger,” she said, and for 
an instant the iron discipline of her 
face broke; but she caught herself. 
“Fly, Billy Danger,” she whispered 
in English. “Fly hence in the in- 
stant, ere thou, too, art lost, for 
nothing can rescue me!” 

I heard feet coming up fast be- 
hind me and turned to see Sir Rev- 
enat, his face white with fury mask- 
ed by a ghastly grin. 

“You are elusive, my friend,” he 
grated. His fingers were playing with 
the heavy ornament dangling on 
his chest, an ovoid with a look of 
half-familiarity. “I fear you’ve lost 
your way. The gate lies at the op- 
posite end of the gardens.” His 
hand reached for me as if to guide me 
back to the path, but I leaned 
aside from it, turned to Milady 
Raire. I put out my hand as if to 
offer it to her, instead reached far- 
ther, ran my fingers down her silken 
side — and felt the slight, tell-tale 
lump there. 

She gasped and drew back. Hu- 
ville let out a roar and caught at 
my arm savagely. A concerted gasp 
had gone up from every mouth 
within gasping range. 

“Barbarian wretch!” Huvile 
howled. “You’d lay hands on the 
person of a lady of the house of 
Ancinet-Chanore?” The rest was 
just an inarticulate bellow backed 
up by a chorus of the same from 
the assembled spectators. 

“Enough!” Huvile yelled. “This 
adventurer comes among us to mock 
the dignity of this house! He open- 
ly offers insult to a noble lady of

IF 




the ancient line!” He whirled to 
face the crowd. “Then I’ll oblige 
him with a taste of the just fury of 
that line! Milords! Bring me my 
sword box!” He turned back to 
me, and there was red fury enough 
in his eyes for ten houses. He 
stepped close, but his face close to 
mine. His fingers played with the 
slave controller at his neck. I 
judged the distance for a jump, but 
he was ready with his finger on the 
control. And we both knew that 
a touch by anyone but himself would 
activate it. 

“You saw,” he hissed. “You know 
her life is in my hands. If you 
expose me, she dies!” 

XXXI 

T he lords and ladies of the House 
of Ancinet-Chanore may have 
been out of touch with reality in 
some ways, but when it came to 
setting up the stage for a blood- 
duel on their fancy lawn, under the 
gay lights, they were the soul of 
efficiency. While a ring of armed 
servants stood obtrusively around 
me, others hurried away and came 
back with a fancy inlaid box of 
darkly polished wood. Huvile lifted 
the lid with a flourish and took out 
a straight-bladed saber heavy enough 
to behead a peasant with. There was 
a lot of gold thread and the jewel- 
work around the hilt, but it was a 
butcher’s weapon. Another one, just 
like it but without the jelly beans, 
was trotted out for me. 

Sir Tanis made the formal speech. 
He cited all the hallowed customs 
that surrounded the curious -custom 



that allowed an irate Lord of the 
House to take a cleaver to anyone 
who annoyed him sufficiently, and 
then in a less pompous tone ex- 
plained the rules to me. They weren’t 
much. We’d hack at each other 
until Sir Revenat was satisfied or 
dead. 

“Man to man,” Sir Tanis finished 
his spiel. The house of Ancinet- 
Chanore defends its honor with the 
ancient right of its strong arm! Let 
her detractors beware!” 

Then the crowd backed off and 
the servants formed up a loose ring, 
fifty feet across. Huvile brandished 
his sword and his eyes ate me alive. 
Fsha-fsha took my jacket and leaned 
close to give me a last word of ad- 
vice. 

“Remember your sorting train- 
ing, Billy Danger! Key in your 
response patterns to his attack 
modes! Play him until you read him 
like a glorm-bulb line! Then strike!” 

“If I don’t make it,” I said, “find 
a way to tell them.” 

“You’ll make it,” he said. “But 
— yeah — I’ll do my best.” 

He withdrew at a curt command 
from Tanis, and Huvile moved out 
to meet me. He held the sword 
lightly, as if his wrist was used to 
handling it. I had an idea the up- 
start sir had spent a lot of hours 
practicing the elevating art of throw- 
ing his weight around. He moved in 
with the blade held low, pointed 
straight at me. I imitated his stance. 
He made a small feint and I slapped 
his blade with mine and moved back 
as he dropped his point and lunged 
and missed my thigh by an inch. 
I tried to blank my mind, key in 



SPACEMANI 



153 




his approach-feint-attack gambit to 
a side-jump-and-counter-cut syn- 
drome. It was hard to bring the 
pattern I wanted into clear focus 
without running through it, physi- 
cally. I backed, made Huvile blink 
by doing the jump and cut in panto- 
mine, two sword-lengths from con- 
tact distance. A nervous titter ran 
through the audience, but that was 
all right. I was pretty sure Fd set 
the response pattern I wanted to 
at least one of his approaches. But 
he had others. 

He came after me, cautious now, 
checking me out. He tried a high 
thrust, a low cut, a one-two lunge 
past my guard. I backed shamelessly, 
for each attack tried to key in an 
appropriate response — 

I felt myself whip to one side, 
slash in an automatic reaction to 
a repetition of his opening gambit. 
My pK)int caught his sleeve and rip- 
ped through the wine-red cloth. So 
far so good. Huvile back-pedaled, 
then tried a furious frontal attack. 
I gave ground, my arm countering 
him with no conscious thought on 
my part. He realized the tactic was 
getting him nowhere and dropped 
his point, whipped it up suddenly 
and he dived forward. I caught it 
barely in time, deflected the blade 
over my right shoulder, and was 
chest to chest with him, our hilts 
locked together. 

“It’s necessary for me to kill you,” 
he whispered. “You understand that 
it’s impossible for me to let you 
live.” His eyes looked mad; his free 
hand still gripped the controller. “If 
I die — she dies. And if I suspect 
you may be gaining — • I plunge 



the lever home. Your only choice is 
to sacrifice yourself.” 

He pushed me away and jabbed 
a vicious cut at me, and then we 
were circling again. 

M y brain seemed to be set in 
concrete. Huvile was nuts — 
no doubt about that. He had braz- 
ened his way into the midst of the 
house of Ancinet Chanore on the 
strength of the invisible knife he 
held at Milady’s heart; and if lie 
saw the game was up — the fragile 
game he’d nursed along for months 
now — he’d kill her wifii utter 
finality and in the most incredible 
agony, as the magne^um flare set 
in her heart burned its way through 
her ribs. 

There was just one possibility. The 
Drathians had gone to a lot of 
trouble to link the life of the slave 
to the well-being of the master; but 
there was one inevitable weak spot. 
Even the most sophisticated cir- 
cuitry couldn’t do its job after it 
was destroyed. I’d proven that; I 
had crushed Hu vile’s controller un- 
der my foot — and he was s* '1 
alive. 

But on the other hand, maybe 
that had been a freak, a defective 
controller. Huvile had been two 
miles away at the time. And it 
was no special trick to rig an elec- 
tronic device so that the cutoff of 
a carrier signal actuated a respon d! 
in a receiver .... 

There was sweat on my face, n o 
all of it from the exercise. 

My only chance was to smash 
the controller and kill Huvile with 
the same stroke — and hope for 



SPACEMAN! 



155 




the best. Because, win or lose, the 
Lady Raire was better dead than 
a slave to this madman. 

While these merry thoughts were 
racing through my mind, I was 
backing, feinting and parrying auto- 
matically. And suddenly Huville’s 
blade dropped, flickered in at me 
and out again and I felt my right 
leg sag and go out from under me. 
I caught myself in time to counter 
an over-eager swing and strike back 
from one knee, but it was only a 
moment’s delay of the inevitable. I 
saw his arm swing back for the fin- 
ishing stroke — 

There was a swirl of silver, and 
the Lady Raire was at his side, 
clutching his sword arm — and then 
she crumpled, white-faced, as the 
controller’s automatic angina circuit 
clamped iron fingers on her heart. 
But it was enough. While Huvile 
staggered, off-balance, his free hand 
groping, I came up in a one-legged 
lunge. He saw me, brought his 
sword up and back, at the same time 
snatched for the controller. 

He was a fraction of a second 
late. My point struck it, burst it 
into chips, slammed on through bone 
and muscle and lodged in his spine. 
He fell slowly, with an amazed look 
on his face. I saw him hit! then I 
went over sideways and grabbed for 
the gapping wound in my thigh and 
felt darkness close in. 

T he House of Ancinet-Chanore 
was very manly about acknowl- 
edging its mistake. I sat across from 
old Lord Pastaine under the can- 
opy on his favorite sun terrace, tell- 
ing him for the sixth or seventh 



time how it had happened that I had 
bought freedom for two slaves and 
then sent them jDff together in my 
boat while I went to the rafts. He 
wagged his Mosaic head and looked 
grave. 

“A serious misjudgment of char- 
acter on your part,” he said. “Yet 
were we not all guilty of misjudg- 
ment? When the Lady Raire re- 
turned, so unexpectedly, I wished 
to open my heart to her — sup- 
pK>sed — savior. I granted the in- 
terloper — Huvile, you say his name 
is?” He shook his head. “An up- 
start, of no family — I granted 
him, I say, every freedom, every 
honor in the gift of Ancinet-Chan- 
ore. As for Milady — if she 
chose to clos6t herself in solitary 
withdrawal from the comfort of her 
family — could I say nay? And then 
I saw the beginnings of the wretch- 
ed maneuverings that would make 
this stranger Head after my death. 
I called for Milady Raire to attend 
me — and she refused! Me! It was 
unheard of! Can you blame me for 
striking her from my memory, as 
one dead? And as for the others — 
venal, grasping, foolish! To what 
depths has the House not fallen 
since the days of my youth, a 
thousand years agone?” 

I listened to him ramble on. I 
had been hearing the same story 
from a variety of directions during 
the past three days, while my leg 
healed under the miracle-medicines 
of old Zeridajh. If any one of the 
Lady Raire’s doting relations had 
car^ enough about her to take 
just one, good, searching look into 
her eyes, they’d have seen that some- 



156 



IF 




thing was seriously amiss. But all 
they saw was a pawn of the board 
of House politics, and her silent 
appeals had gone unanswered. As 
for why she hadn’t defied Huvile, 
faced death before submitting to 
enslavement to his ambitions — I 
could guess that half an hour of 
sub-fatal angina might be a per- 
suasion that would convince a vic- 
tim who could laugh at the threat 
of mere death. 

“If you’d arrange for me to see 
the Lady Raire for a few minutes,” 
I butted in the Milord’s nmibling 
assessment of the former Sir Rev- 
enat’s character, “I’d be most appre- 
ciative.” 

He looked grave. “I believe we 
all agree that it would be best not 
to reawaken the unhappy emotions 
of these past months by and refer- 
ences thereto,” he said. “We are 
grateful to you. Captain Danger. The 
House will be forever in your debt. 
I’m sure Milady will understand if 
you slip quietly away, leaving her 
to the ministrations of her family, 
those who know where her in- 
terests lie.” 

I got the idea. It had been ex- 
plained to me in slightly varying 
terms by no less than twelve solemn 
pillars of the House of Ancinet- 
Chanore. The Lady Raire, having 
had one close brush with an inter- 
loper, would not be exposed to the 
questionable influences of another. 
They were glad I’d happened along 
in time to break the spell. But now 
the lady would return to her own 
kind, her own life. 

And they were right, of course. I 
didn’t know just what it .was that 



Jongo would have to say to Milady 
Raire of the ancient house of Anci- 
net-Chanore. I’d had my share of 
wild fancies, but none of them were 
wild enough to include offering her 
boudoir space aboard my boat as 
an alternative to the Estates of 
Ancinet-Chanore. 

On the way out. Sir Tanis offered 
me a crack at a lot of fancy trade 
opportunities, letters of recommen- 
dation to any house I mi^t name 
and assorted other vague rewards, 
and ended with a hint, none too 
closely veiled, that any further at- 
tempt to see the Lady would end 
unhappily for me. I told him I got 
the idea and walked out into the twi- 
light through the high gates of the 
house with no more than a slight 
limp to remind me of my visit. 

xxxn 

F sha-fsha was waiting for me at 
the boat. I told him about my 
parting interviews with the House 
of Ancinet-Chanore. He listened. 

“You never learn, do you, Billy?” 
He wagged his head sadly. 

“I’ve learned that there’s no place 
for me in fancy company,” I said. 
“Give me the honest solitude of 
space, and a trail of new worlds 
waiting ahead. That’s my style.” 
“You saved the lady’s life on Gar 
28, you know,” Fsha-fsha said, talk- 
ing to himself. “If you hadn’t done 
what you did — when you did — 
she’d never have lived out the first 
week. It was too bad you didn’t 
look and listen a bit before you 
handed her over to the H’eeaq. But 
then, who would have known, eh?”

“Let’s forget all that,” I suggested. 
“The ship’s trimmed to lift — ” 

“Then at Drath, you picked her 
out from under the Tri arch’s nose 
in as smooth a counter swindle as 
I’ve ever heard of. He had no idea 
of letting them go, you know. They’d 
have been arrested at the port — 
except that the Rule Keepers were 
caught short when the tub lifted 
without you. Your only mistake was 
in trusting Huvile — ” 

‘Trusting Huvile!” 

“You trusted him. You sent him 
along to an unguarded ship. If you’d 
worked just one angle a little more 
subtly — gone out yourself to see 
the lady aboard and then lifted, leav- 
ing Huvile behind — but this is 
neither here nor there. For the sec- 
ond time, you saved her — and 
handed her over to her enemy.” 

“I know that,” I snapped. “I’ve 
kicked myself for it — ” 

“And now — here you are, re- 
peating the pattern,” he bored on. 
“Three times and out.” 

“What?” 

“You saved the Lady again, Billy. 
Plucked her out of the wicked hands 
of her tormentor ...” 

“And?” 

“And handed her over to her ene- 
mies.” 

“Her family has her!” 

“That’s what I said.” 

“Then ...” Wheels were begin- 
ning to whirl in front of my eyes. 

“Maybe,” I said, “you’d better tell 
me exactly what you’re talking about

S he opened her eyes, startled, when 
I leaned over her sleeping couch. 



“Billy Danger,” she breathed. “Is 
it thee? Why came you not to me 
ere now?” • 

“An acute attack of stupidity. Mi- 
lady,” I whispered. 

She smiled a dazzling smile. “My 
name is Raire, Billy. I am no one’s 
lady.” 

“You’re mine,” I said. 

“Always, my Billy.” She reached 
and drew my face down to hers. Her 
lips were softer even than I had 
dreamed. 

“Come,” I said. 

She rose silently and Eureka rub- 
bed himself across her knees. They 
followed me across the wide room, 
along a still corridor. In the great 
hall below, I asked her to show me 
the shortest route to the grounds. 
She led the way along a cloistered 
arcade, through a walled garden, 
onto a wide terrace above the dark 
sweep of skylit lawn. 

“Billy. When I pass this door, the 
house ^arm will be set off.” 

“I know. That’s why I dropped 
in on the roof in a one-man heli. 
Too bad we couldn’t leave the same 
way, Let’s go.” 

We started out at a run toward 
the trees. We had gone fifty feet 
when lights sprang up across the 
back of the house. I turned and took 
aim with my filament gun and 
knocked out the two biggest poly- 
arcs, and we sprinted for cover, 
Eureka loping in the lead. A new 
light sprang up, just too late, swept 
the stretch of grass we had just 
crossed. We reached the trees, went 
flat. Men were coming through the 
rear doors of the house. There was 
a lot of yelling.

1 looked up. Against the swirls 
and clots of stars, nothing was visi- 
ble. 1 checked my watch again; Fsha- 
fsha was two minutes late. The line 
of men was moving down across the 
lawn. In half a minute, they’d reach 
the trees. 

There was a wink of light from 
above, followed by a dull baroom 
as of distant thunder. A high whistl- 
ing screech became audible, descend- 
ed to a full-throated roar; something 
flashed overhead — a long shape 
ablaze with lights. A second gun- 
boat slammed across in the wake 
of the first. 

“That cuts it,” I said. “Fsha-fsha’s 
been picked off.” 

A terrific detonation boomed, 
drawling itself out into a bellow of 
power. I saw a dark shape flash past 
against the clotted stars. The men 
on the lawn saw it, too. They halted 
their advance, looking up at the dark 
boat that had shot past on an op- 
posite course to the security cutters. 

“Look!” The Lady Raire pointed. 
Something big and dark was drifting 
toward our position across the lake. 
It was Jongo III, barely a yard above 
the surface of the water, concealed 
from the house by the trees. We 
jumped up and ran for it. Her bow 
lights came on, dazzling as suns, 
traversed over us, lanced out to 
blind the men beyond the trees. I 
could see the soft glow from her 
open entry port. We splashed out 
into knee-deep water; I tossed Eure- 
ka in, then jumped, caught the rail, 
pulled myself in, reached back for 
the Lady Raire as men burst through 
the screen of trees. Then ^e were

“It was a pretty world, Milady,” 
I said. “You’re going to miss it.” 
“Dost know what place I truly 
dreamed of, my Billy, when the 
gray years of Drath lengthened?” 
“The garden,” I suggested. 
“They’re very beautiful, with the 
sun on them.” 

“I dreamt of the caves, and the 
green shade of the giant peas, and 
the simple loyalty of our good Eu- 
reka.” She strok^ the gizzled head. 

“Never,” Fsha-fsha said from the 
depths of the big command chair, 
“will I understand the motivations 
of you propagators. Still, life in your 
company promises to be diverting. 
I’ll say that for it.” He showed us 
that ghastly expression he used. 

“But tell me, Milady — if the 
question isn’t impertinent — what 
were you doing out there, at the far 
end of the Eastern Arm?” 

“Haven’t you guessed?” she smil- 
ed at him. “Until Lord Desroy 
caught me, I was running away.” 

“I knew it!” Fsha-fsha boomed. 
“And now that the great quest is 
finished — where to?” 

“Anywhere,” I said. I put my arm 
around Raire’s flower-slim waist and 
drew her to me. “Anywhere at all.” 
The sweet hum of the mighty and 
ancient engines drummed softly 
through the deck. Together, we 
watched the blaze of Center move

Dear Editor: 

A good futuristic fantasy cover 
has a lot to do with the sale of a 
good science-fiction periodical. No 
other cover design has ever matched 
the ones that are displayed on the 
Galaxy publications. The best IVe 
noticed, though, are the ones illus- 
trated by McKenna. His creativity 
does not lack realism, yet still cap- 
tures the fantastic mood of the set- 
ting. 

If it’s possible, I wish you would 
try and get more of McKenna’s 
illustrations on the covers of your 
publications. Good science-fiction 
literature deserves good illustra- 
tion. — Rick Barbagelata, 10 Mo- 
hawk Place, Amsterdam, N.Y.

Gents : 

Many years ago, I think when I 
was about in the fifth grade, in a 
one-room country school complete 
with twin outhouses, I sneaked out 
back of the barn and dug up the 
one page in the Sunday Funnies 
that my ma used to tear out and 
bury before I was allowed to look. 

That is how I discovered ‘‘Buck 
Rodgers.” I still don’t know to 
this day whether I kept on reading 
it because I liked it — or because 
Mama threw a fit. Whatever the 



reason, I became hooked, and event- 
ually graduated to mainlining, via 
the printed word. 

Now, after all these years, I find 
myself becoming bored with the end- 
less barraige of sociological stories 
written by deviant psychiatrists. 

To relieve the boredom, and may- 
be avoid having to go find some new 
kind of escapist literature, I have 
begun to pick the stories apart, on 
the low, somewhat moronic level of 
obvious contradictions. Herein, I 
seem to have found myself a new 
hobby, but it ought to be a lot more 
fun if I can aggravate the writers 
themselves or, better yet, the editor 
who lets these things by. Besides, 
this is one hell of a good way for 
me to get back at editors for all 
the times they have picked my 
articles apart and made me re- 
write them! 

Sooooo — I have founded, and am 
President, Vice-President, Secretary, 
Treasurer, pot-walloper, janitor, 
and sole member of the Beezlehead 
Society of America — an organi- 
zation devoted to the picking-apart 
of science-fiction stories. 

For my first effort, let us take 
“Truce of Consequences.” Where the 
Ancient Librarian points a light at 
“Retief’s heart and says: I’ve got 
this light right in your eye — .”

But, the pen-and-ink on page 23 
shows the BE M’s with eyes about 
where Homo the Sap’s would be? 

Then, again, in ‘‘Science-Fiction 
Byways,” Lin Carter says: “Way 
back in 1934, when (We) were very 
young — ” So what’s with him? 
Two heads, or a mouse in his poc- 
ket? 

And, I wish C. C. MacApp would 
make up his mind. When he was 
describing the Remm, first they had 
necks -v then they didn’t. Outside 
the Overseers’ ship was “a wall or 
forest.” OK — I igdve up! Which 
was it? And, while we’re at it, which 
was it, “a huge arrow — or a 
feathered spear?” 

For that matter, maybe Morrow 
can tell me what he did with the 
other half of the bird-dog BEM’s 
membrane, and where’s the “huge 
arrow or feathered spear” the crea- 
ture was trying to throw? 

Cumawn, fellers — you can do 
better than this. If I wrote an arti- 
cle with that many holes in it, 
they’d drum me out of the type- 
writer corps, and maybe sentence 
me to grow long fingernails for 
good measure! 

And, if the eddytore don’t say 
sumthin’ about this lousy typing. 
I’ll be sore dissapointed! I was 
taught in the overstrikenospace 
school. — Eugene Austin, P.O. Box

Dear Editor: 

The Marsh issue of If was ex- 
ceptional. The simplicity of the 
cover proclaimed an unusual issue, 
and it did not lie. Although I 
thoroughly enjoyed it, I would have 
liked a longer story by Isaac Asi- 
mov. 

More authors I would like to see; 
Fredric Brown, Theodore Sturgeon, 
Clifford Simak, more (much more) 



Isaae Asimov, and someone you may 
vaguely remember, Frederik Pohl. 

Re your editorial in the Februai^y 
issue : there are some things we can 
do to “convert” others to science 
fiction. One way is to support the 
good sf TV shows and movies (for 
example. Star Trek, Fantastic Voy- 
age, The Invaders, The 21st Century, 
an excellent blend of science fact 
and fiction with the emphasis on 
fact, and Fahrenheit 4,51), 

My other idea is crazier. Many 
people who don't care for modem sf 
are crazy about the works of, say 
Jules Veme or H. G. Wells. Why? 
TheyWe old! So here’s my plan: All 
new sf magazines and books will be 
dated before 1900. New readers, 
thinking them classic reprints, will 
swarm to purchase them. Old fen, 
knowing the plan, will still read 
them, putting up with indexing 
problems and so forth for the ideal 
of spreading sf. Of course, there are 
inherent difficulties, but if the pro- 
"gram went into effect with publicity 
for the “reprints” . 

May If win the next Hugo, too.

Dead Editor: 

I found the Hugo- winner s’ issue 
of If to be very, very good, but the 
biggest impression was made not 
by the contents, but by the pack- 
aging. Mr. McKenna’s cover was 
(is) beautiful. My only criticism is: 
get rid of that spaceship. It is un- 
necessary (someone had the presence 
of mind to put it on the hack cover) 
and detracts from the overall effect 
even more than the printing on the 
front. 

Nothing personal intended, but I 
wouldn’t want the March cover to 
win a Best-Cover Hugo: I’d rather 
see the covers get even better. It

just goes to show that a cover which

Dear Fred: 

I was interested to see the let- 
ter in the current If about my ‘‘Star 
Trek*^ book (even though the lady 
didn’t like it). It occurred to me 
that maybe your readers would be 
interested in a few things that have 
emerged from it. 

The book, which is an adaptation 
of seven scripts from the TV show, 
went on sale in January, and by 
March had already gone into a sec- 
ond printing. In those three months 
I got more fan mail about it than 
I have for any of my 21 other books. 
Some of these were from women 
(chiefly housewives and college un- 
dergraduates) complaining that I 
didn’t do justice to Mr. Spock, whom 
they adore. 

The vast majority, however, were 
from children in the 12-14 age back- 
et. Almost unanimously, they (a) 
asked for another book; (b) asked 
what other books I had written ; and 
(c) asked what other s-f books I 
would recommend. Answering this 
influx was almost as big a job as 
writing the book had been, and the 
letters are still coming in at the 
rate of two or three a day. My 
editor at Bantam tells me that they 
too have been swamped. 

In short, it looks as though there 
is a whole new audience being creat- 
ed here, not just for s-f on tele- 
vision, but in print as well. Almost 
none of these youngsters has seen 
a s-f book or magazine before. 

Incidentally, it now appears that 
the show is going to go on another 
year. — and I am doing another 

162 



book, which will probably be out in 
November. — James Blish. 

# You forgot to mention the other 
thing you’ve been doing lately — 
writing your new novel, Faust 
Aleph-Null, which starts in our next 
issue ! 

And that, it would seem, is about 
all for this month. As you know, 
each month we bring you one new 
writer making his first professional 
appearance in print anywhere with 
a science-fiction story. We’ve been 
doing this in every issue of If for 
the past five years or so, and when 
we started the wise money was bet- 
ting that we’d have to give it up in 
six months because there just 
weren’t that many new writers com- 
ing along. 

As you see, the wise money was 
wrong. Not only that, but the stories 
have in fact been coming in in such 
good supply that this month we’re 
bringing you two firsts — both of 
them, as it happens, coming from 
across the sea. 

Number One is E. Audrey Walton, 
who lives in Coventry, England, is 
the grand-daughter of an amateur 
astronomer and the daughter of a 
suffragette (yes, we can see the 
effects of heredity!) and came to 
us by way of a short-story contest 
run by the National Fantasy Fan 
Federation. (Not the first time 
we’ve found ourselves buying stories 
entered in this annual event.) 

Number Two Is Alan Dirkson, 
who is also English, but wrote 
Adam*js Eva while living in a gar- 
ret in Paris where the stairs were 
a rickety ladder and the door was a 
hole in the roof, and when last 
heard from had moved on to Spain. 
He reports it took him 83 rejection 
slips to make his first sale. You 
see? Never give up!
