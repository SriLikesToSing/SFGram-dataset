OF WORMS AND MEN 



A PLANARIAN worm isn’t the 
brightest creature in the 
world, but he can be taught a few 
simple tricks. Perhaps “taught” 
is not the exact word. It is really 
conditioning, as with Pavlov’s 
dogs. One of the few stimuli that 
really move a planarian to action 
is pain ... or whatever it is that 
we can call a planarian’s equiv- 
alent of pain when he is subjected 
to an electric shock. Sting him 
with a mild current, flash a light 
and ultimately — given patience 
— most of the time he will re- 
ward you by reacting to the light 
with the same faint contraction 
he originally displayed only for 
the shock. 

Now, once you’ve got your 
planarian cringing every time you 
flash a light on him, you may 
wonder what else you can do with 



him. Here’s what: you can chop 
him up into fine pieces and feed 
him to other planarians. To plan- 
arians, say, which have never 
been conditioned at all. 

You will then find a very odd 
thing. The planarians who have 
feasted on their brother, although 
not themselves conditioned at all, 
act as though they had been — a 
little bit They don’t cringe at 
the light; but if you then begin 
the conditioning routine on them 
you will discover that they re- 
quire far fewer repetitions before 
they respond strongly. 

It is as though the untutored 
worm, by eating part of his highly 
educated brother, absorbs enough 
education with his lunch to skip 
the first few grades of the Pav- 
lovian course, entering at some- 
thing like the high school level.

TF YOU have a mind to, you 
-*■ can easily make a great leap 
from this observed fact into the 
glittering area of generalizations. 

Why, that’s almost the same, 
you might say, as eating the heart 
of a slain enemy warrior in order 
to absorb his strength. If a worm 
can get education through his 
digestive tract, why can’t a man 
acquire virtue the same way? And 
since this is what primitive sav- 
ages hold to be true, doesn’t this 
prove once again that modern 
science has gone all wrong and 
we ought to go back to the ways 
of our scienceless forebears? 

This perilous leap is taken 
pretty frequently. We learn that 
South American witch doctors 
used a precursor of quinine and 
Chinese prescribed molds that 
may have contained penicillin : 
the leaper concludes that witch 
. doctors must have known plenty 
we ignorant moderns don’t give 
them credit for. Astrologers fore- 
told human affairs from the posi- 
tion of heavenly bodies, and now 
we predict radio transmission per- 
formance from the cycle of sun- 
spots; astrology is thus shown to 
have been on the right track — 
three milennia ago! 

It is an easy leap to take, but 
it lands you in a thicket of begged 
questions and dubious inferences 
every time. The generalizations 
simply don’t work. 



The observed fact about plan- 
arian worms turns out to rest on 
an essential difference between 
worms and ourselves. We digest 
and break down our food. The 
planarian, a far simpler organism, 
seems to incorporate whole blocks 
of its food into its body — and if 
the bits of what in a planarian 
pass for “nervous tissue” are con- 
ditioned, then part of the cannibal 
worm is also conditioned. Ancient 
medicine men did prescribe some 
potentially valuable drugs. But, 
look, they prescribed everything! 
— at least, everything that they 
could force down a sufferer’s 
throat without causing him at 
once to scream and drop dead; 
and likely enough they prescribed 
those things a time or two, too, 
until the relatives of their late 
patients began coming after them 
with spears. And astrology, what- 
ever its (unproven) merits, cer- 
tainly deserves no credit for 
predicting upper-atmosphere ion- 
ization patterns; the founders of 
astrology knew of the existence of 
neither ions nor ionosphere. 

One anomalous fact does not 
make a law. One good guess does 
not make a science. 

It does appear that planarian 
worms can swallow someone 
else’s conditioning whole. But is 
that any reason why human be- 
ings should?

HERE GATHER THE 



by CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 



It began on a battlefield a century 
ago — and it ends tomorrow, with all 
the galaxy's stars locked in a great 
clash of conflicting, alien creeds! 



I 

^TVHE NOISE was ended now. 
•*- The smoke drifted like thin, 
gray wisps of fog, above the tor- 
tured earth and the shattered 
fences, and the peach trees that 
had been whittled into toothpicks 
by cannon fire. For a moment 
silence, if not peace, fell upon 
those few square miles of ground 
where men had fought. 

For endless time ' there had 
been belching thunder, rolling 
from horizon to horizon. The 



gouted earth spouted in the sky. 
Horses screamed, mixed with the 
hoarse bellowing of men; the 
whistling of metal and the thud 
when the whistle ended; the flash 
of searing fire and the brightness 
of the steel; the bravery of the 
colors snapping in the wind. 

Then it all had ended. There 
was a silence. 

But silence was an alien note 
upon this field, on this day. It 
was broken by the whimper of 
pain, the cry for water and the 
prayer for death — the crying 



8 



GALAXY 



STARS 



Illustrated by WOOD 



FIRST OF TWO PARTS 



and the calling and the whimper- 
ing that would go on for hours 
beneath the summer sun. Later 
the huddled shapes would grow 
quiet and still and there would 
be an odor that would sicken all 
who passed and the graves would 
be shallow graves. 

There was wheat that never 
would be harvested. There were 
trees that would not bloom when 
spring came round again. On the 
slope of land that ran up to the 
ridge were the words unspoken 
and the deeds undone, and the 



sodden bundles that cried aloud 
the empty waste of death. 

There were proud names that 
were the prouder now, but now 
no more than names to echo 
down the ages — the Iron Bri- 
gade, the 5th New Hampshire, 
the 1st Minnesota, the 2nd Mas- 
sachusetts, the 16th Maine. 

And there was Enoch Wallace. 

He still held the shattered 
musket and there were blisters 
on his hands. His face was 
smudged with powder. His shoes 
were caked with dust and blood. 

He was still alive. 

TVR. ERWIN HARDWICKE 
rolled the pencil back and 
forth between his palms, an ir- 
ritating business. He eyed the 
man across the desk from him 
with some calculation. 

“What I can’t figure out,” said 
Hardwicke, “is why you should 
come to us.” 

“Well, you’re the National 
Academy and I thought — ” 

“And you’re Intelligence.” 

“Look, doctor, if it suits you 
better, let’s call this visit unoffi- 
cial. Say I’m a puzzled citizen 
who dropped in to see if you 
could help.” 

“It’s not that I wouldn’t like to 
help. I don’t see how I can. The 
whole thing is so hazy and so 
hypothetical.” 

“Damn it, man,” Claude Lewis 
said, “you can’t deny the proof — 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



9 



the little that I have been able to 
put my hands on.” 

“All right, then,” said Hard- 
wicke, “let’s start over once again 
and take it piece by piece. You 
say you have this man:” 

“His name,” said Lewis, “is 
Enoch Wallace. Chronologically, 
he is 124 years old. He was born 
on a farm a few miles from the 
town of Millville in Wisconsin, 
April 22, 1840, and he is the only 
child of Jedediah and Amanda 
Wallace. He enlisted among the 
first when Abe Lincoln called for 
volunteers. He was with the Iron 
Brigade, which was virtually 
wiped out at Gettysburg in 1863. 
But Wallace somehow managed 
to get transferred to another fight- 
ing outfit and fought down across 
Virginia under Grant. He was in 
on the end of it at Appomattox.” 
“You’ve run a check on him?” 
“I’ve looked up his records. 
The record of enlistment at the 
state capitol in Madison. The rest 
of it, including discharge, here in 
Washington.” 

“You say he looks like thirty.” 
“Not a day beyond it. Maybe 
even less.” 

“But you haven’t talked with 
him.” 

Lewis shook his head. 

“He may not be the man. If 
you had fingerprints ...” 

“At the time of the Civil war,” 
said Lewis, “they’d not thought 
of fingerprints.” 



“The last of the veterans of 
the Civil war,” said Hardwicke, 
“died several years ago. A Con- 
federate drummer boy, I think. 
There must be some mistake.” 
Lewis shook his head. “I 
thought so myself, when I was 
assigned to it.” 

“How come you were assigned? 
How does Intelligence get in- 
volved in a deal like this?” 

“I’ll admit,” said Lewis, “that 
it’s a bit unusual. But there were 
so many implications ...” 
“Immortality, you mean.” 

C6TT CROSSED our mind, per- 
haps. But only incidentally. 
There were other considerations. 
It was a strange setup that bore 
looking into.” 

“But Intelligence ...” 

Lewis grinned. “You are think- 
ing, why not a scientific outfit? 
Logically, I suppose it should 
have been. But one of our men 
ran afoul of it. He was on vaca- 
tion. Had relatives in Wisconsin. 
He heard a rumor — just the 
vaguest casual gossip. So he 
nosed around a bit. He didn’t find 
out too much, but enough to 
make him think there might be 
something to it.” 

“That’s the thing that puzzles 
me,” said Hardwicke. “How could 
a man live for 124 years in one 
locality without becoming a ce- 
lebrity that the world would hear 
about? Can you imagine what 



10 



GALAXY 



the newspapers could do with a 
thing like this?” 

Lewis said, “I shudder when I 
think about it.” 

“You haven’t told me how.” 
“This,” said Lewis, “is a bit 
hard to explain. You’d have to 
know the country and the people 
in it. The southwestern corner of 
Wisconsin is bounded by two 
rivers, the Mississippi on the 
west, the Wisconsin on the north. 
Away from the rivers there is flat, 
broad prairie land, rich land, with 
prosperous farms and towns. But 
the land that runs down to the 
river is rough and rugged; high 
hills and bluffs and deep ravines 
and cliffs, and there are certain 
areas forming bays or pockets 
that are isolated. They are served 
by inadequate roads and the 
small, rough farms are inhabited 
by a people who are closer, per- 
haps, to the pioneer days of a 
hundred years ago than they are 
to the twentieth century. They 
have cars, of course, and radios, 
and someday soon, perhaps, even 
television. But in spirit they are 
conservative and clannish. Not 
all the people, of course. Not 
even many of them. But these 
little isolated neighborhoods. 

“At one time there were a lot 
of farms in these isolated pockets, 
but today a man can hardly make 
a living on a farm of that sort. 
Slowly the people are being 
squeezed out of the areas by eco- 



nomic circumstances. They sell 
their farms for whatever they can 
get for them and move some- 
where else, to the cities mostly, 
where they can make a living.” 

Hardwicke nodded. “And the 
ones that are left, of course, are 
the most conservative and clan- 
nish.” 

“Right. Most of the land now 
is held by absentee owners who 
make no pretense of farming it. 
They may run a few head of cat- 
tle on it, but that is all. It’s not 
too bad as a tax write-off for 
someone who needs that sort of 
thing. And in the land-bank days 
a lot of the land was put into the 
bank.” 

“You’re trying to tell me these 
backwoods people are engaged in 
a conspiracy of silence?” 

T EWIS HESITATED. “Per- 
haps not anything as formal 
as that. It is just their way of 
doing things, a holdover from the 
old, stout pioneer philosophy. 
They minded their own business. 
They didn’t want folks interfer- 
ing with them and they interfered 
with no one else. If a man wanted 
to live to be a thousand, it might 
be a thing of wonder, but it was 
his own damn business. And if 
he wanted to live alone and be 
let alone while he was doing it, 
that was his business, too. They 
might talk about it among them- 
selves, but to no one else. They’d 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



11 



resent it if some outsider tried to 
talk about it. 

“After a time, I suppose, they 
came to accept the fact that Wal- 
lace kept on being young while 
they were growing old. New gen- 
erations accepted it because their 
elders saw in it nothing too un- 
usual — and, anyhow, no one saw 
much of Wallace. He kept strictly 
to himself. 

“And in the nearby areas the 
thing, when it was thought of at 
all, grew to be just another crazy 
tale that wasn’t worth looking 
into. Maybe just a joke among 
those folks down Dark Hollow 
way. A man might look ridiculous 
if he went prying into it.” 

“But your man looked into it.” 
“Yes. Don’t ask me why.” 

“Yet he wasn’t assigned to fol- 
low up the job.” 

“He was needed somewhere 
else. And, besides, he was known 
back there.” 

“And you?” 

“It took two years of work.” 
“But now you know the story.” 
“Not all of it. There are more 
questions now than there were to 
start with.” 

“You’ve seen this man.” 
“Many times,” said Lewis. “But 
I’ve never talked with him. I 
don’t think he’s ever seen me. He 
takes a walk each day before he 
goes to get the mail. He never 
moves off the place, you see. The 
mailman brings out the little stuff 



he needs. A bag of flour, a pound 
of bacon, a dozen eggs, cigars 
and sometimes liquor.” 

“But that must be against the 
postal regulations.” 

“Of course it is. But mailmen 
have been doing it for years. The 
mailmen probably are the only 
friends he has ever had.” 

“I take it this Wallace doesn’t 
do much farming.” 

“None at all. He has a little 
vegetable garden, but that is all 
he does. The place has gone back 
pretty much to wilderness.” 

“But he has to live. He must 
get money somewhere.” 

“He does,” said Lewis. “Every 
five or ten years or so he ships 
off a fist full of gems to an outfit 
in New York.” 

“Legal?” 

“If you mean, is it hot, I don’t 
think so. If someone wanted to 
make a case of it, I suppose there 
are illegalities.” 

“And you don’t mind?” 

UT CHECKED on this firm,” 
-*• said Lewis, “and they were 
rather nervous. For one thing, 
they’d been stealing Wallace 
blind. I told them to keep on 
buying. I told them that if any- 
one came around to check, to re- 
fer them straight to me. I told 
them to keep their mouths shut 
and not change anything.” 

“You don’t want anyone to 
scare him off,” said Hardwicke.

GALAXY 



“You’re damned right I don’t. 
I want everything to stay just 
the way it is. And before you ask 
me where the stones come from, 
I’ll tell you I don’t know.” 

“He maybe has a mine.” 
“That would be quite a mine. 
Diamonds and rubies and emer- 
alds, all out of the same mine.” 
“I would suspect, even at the 
prices that he gets from them, he 
picks up a fair income.” 

Lewis nodded. “Apparently he 
only sends a shipment in when 
he runs out of cash. He wouldn’t 
need too much. He lives rather 
simply to judge from the grub 
he buys. But he subscribes to a 
lot of daily papers and news mag- 
azines and to dozens of scientific 
journals. He buys a lot of books.” 
“Technical books?” 

“Some of .them, of course, but 
mostly keeping up with new de- 
velopments. Physics and chemis- 
try and biology — all that sort 
of stuff.” 

“But I don’t ...” 

“Of course you don’t. Neither 
do I. He’s no scientist. Or at least 
he has no formal education in 
the sciences. Back in the days 
when he went to school there 
wasn’t much of it — not in the 
sense of today’s scientific educa- 
tion. And whatever he learned 
then would be fairly worthless 
now in any event. He went 
through grade school — one of 
those one-room country schools 



— and spent one winter at what 
was called an academy that oper- 
ated for a year or two down in 
Millville village. In case you don’t 
know, that was considerably bet- 
ter than par back in the 1850s. 
He was, apparently, a fairly 
bright young man.” 

Hardwicke shook his head. “It 
sounds incredible. You’ve checked 
on all of this?” 

“As well as I could. I had to 
go at it gingerly. I wanted no one 
to catch on. And one thing I for- 
got — he does a lot of writing. 
He buys these big bound record 
books, in lots of a dozen at the 
time. He buys ink by the pint.” 

TTARDWICKE GOT up from 
his desk and paced up and 
down the room. 

“Lewis,” he said, “if you hadn’t 
shown me your credentials and 
if I hadn’t checked on them, I’d 
figure all of this to be a very 
tasteless joke.” 

He went back and sat down 
again. He picked up the pencil 
and started rolling it between his 
palms once more. 

“You’ve been on the case two 
years,” he said. “You have no 
ideas?” 

“Not a one,” said Lewis. “I’m 
entirely baffled. That is why I’m 
here.” 

“Tell me more of his history. 
After the war, that is.” 

“His mother died,” said Lewis, 



HERE GATHER THE STARS

“while he was away. His father 
and the neighbors buried her right 
there on the farm. That was the 
way a lot of people did it then. 
Young Wallace got a furlough, 
but not in time to get home for 
the funeral. There wasn’t much 
embalming done in those days 
and the traveling was slow. Then 
he went back to the war. So far 
as I can find, it was his only fur- 
lough. The old man lived alone 
and worked the farm, batching it 
and getting along all right. From 
what I can pick up, he was a good 
farmer, an exceptionally good 
farmer for his day. He subscribed 
to some farm journals and was 
progressive in his ideas. He paid 
attention to such things as crop 
rotation and the prevention of 
erosion. The farm wasn’t much of 
a farm by modern standards, but 
it made him a living and a little 
extra he managed to lay by. 

“Then Enoch came home from 
the war and they farmed the 
place together for a year or so. 
The old man bought a mower — 
one of those horse-drawn con- 
traptions with a sickle bar to cut 
hay or grain. It was the proges- 
sive thing to do. It beat a scythe 
all hollow. 

“Then one afternoon the old 
man went out to mow a hayfield. 
The horses ran away. Something 
must have scared them. Enoch’s 
father was thrown off the seat 
and forward, in front of the sickle 



bar. It was not a pretty way to 
die.” 

Hardwicke made a grimace of 
distaste. “Horrible,” he said. 

“Enoch went out and gathered 
up his father and got the body 
to the house. Then he took a gun 
and went hunting for the horses. 
He found them down in the cor- 
ner of the pasture and he shot the 
two of them, and he left them. 
I mean exactly that. For years 
their skeletons lay there in the 
pasture, where he’d killed them. 
They were still hitched to the 
mower until the harness rotted. 

“Then he went back to the 
house and laid his father out. He 
washed him and he dressed him 
in the good black suit and laid 
him on a board, then went out 
to the barn and carpentered a 
coffin. And after that, he dug a 
grave beside his mother’s grave. 
He finished it by lantern light, 
then went back to the house and 
sat up with his father. When 
morning came, he went to tell the 
nearest neighbor and that neigh- 
bor notified the others and some- 
one went to get a preacher. Late 
in the afternoon they had the 
funeral and Enoch went back to 
the house. He has lived there ever 
since, but he never farmed the 
land. Except the garden, that is.” 

64V7THJ TOLD me these peo- 
pie wouldn’t talk to stran- 
gers. You seem to have learned

a good deal about their peculiar 
hermit.” 

“It took two years to do it. I 
infiltrated them. I bought a beat- 
up car and drifted into Millville 
and I let it out that I was a 
ginseng hunter.” 

“A what?” 

“A ginseng hunter. Ginseng is 
a plant.” 

“Yes, I know. But there’s been 
no market for it for years.” 

“A small market and an occa- 
sional one. Exporters will take on 
some of it. But I hunted other 
medicinal plants as well and pre- 
tended an extensive knowledge 
of them and their use. Pretended 
isn’t actually the word; I boned 
up plenty on them.” 

“The kind of simple soul,” said 
Hardwicke, “those folks could 
understand. A sort of cultural 
throwback. And inoffensive, too. 
Perhaps not quite right in the 
head.” 

Lewis nodded. “It worked even 
better than I thought. I just wan- 
dered around and people talked 
to me. I even found some ginseng. 
There was one family in particu- 
lar — the Fisher family. They 
live down in the river bottoms 
below the Wallace farm, which 
sits on the ridge above the bluffs. 
They’ve lived there almost as 
long as the Wallace family, but 
a different stripe entirely. The 
Fishers are a coon-hunting, cat- 
fishing, moonshine-cooking tribe. 



They found a kindred spirit in 
me. I was just as shiftless and 
no-account as they were. I helped 
them with their moonshine, both 
in the making and the drinking. 
And once in a while the peddling. 
I went fishing with them and 
hunting with them, and I sat 
around and talked and they 
showed me a place or two where 
I might find some ginseng. Sang 
is what they call it. I imagine a 
social scientist might find a gold 
mine in the Fishers. There is one 
girl — a deaf-mute, but a pretty 
thing — and she can charm off 
warts.” 

“I recognize the type,” said 
Hardwicke. “I was born and 
raised in the southern moun- 
tains.” 

“They were the ones who told 
me about the team and mower. 
So one day I went up in that 
corner of the Wallace pasture 
and did some digging. I found a 
horse’s skull and some other 
bones.” 

“But no way of knowing if it 
was one of the Wallace horses.” 
“Perhaps not,” said Lewis. “But 
I found part of the mower as 
well. Not much left of it, but 
enough to identify.” 

“Let’s get back to the history,” 
suggested Hardwicke. “After the 
father’s death, Enoch stayed on 
at the farm. He never left it?” 
Lewis shook his head. “He 
lives in the same house. Not a

thing’s been changed. And the 
house apparently has aged no 
more than the man.” 

“You’ve been in the house?” 

“Not in it. At it. I will tell you 
how it was.” 

II 

TTE HAD an hour. He knew he 
had an hour, for he had 
timed Enoch Wallace during the 
last ten days. And from the time 
he left the house until he got back 
with his mail, it had never been 
less than an hour. Sometimes a 
little longer, when the mailman 
might be late, or they got to talk- 
ing. But an hour, Lewis told him- 
self, was all that he could count 
on. 

Wallace had disappeared down 
the slope of ridge, heading for 
the point of rocks that towered 
above the bluff face, with the 
Wisconsin river running there be- 
low. He would climb the rocks 
and stand there, with the rifle 
tucked beneath his arm, to gaze 
across the wilderness of the river 
valley. Then he would go back 
down the rocks again and trudge 
along the wooded path to where, 
in proper season, the pink lady 
slippers grew, and from there up 
the hill again to the spring that 
gushed out of the hillside just 
below the ancient field that had 
lain fallow for a century or more, 
and then along the slope until 



he hit the almost overgrown road 
and so down to the mailbox. 

In the ten days that Lewis had 
watched him, his route had never 
varied. It was likely, Lewis told 
himself, that it had not varied 
through the years. Wallace did 
not hurry. He walked as if he 
had all the time there was. And 
he stopped along the way to 
renew acquaintances with old 
friends of his — a tree, a squirrel, 
a flower. He was a rugged man 
and there still was much of the 
soldier in him — old tricks and 
habits left from the bitter years 
of campaigning under many lead- 
ers. He walked with his head 
held high and his shoulders back, 
and he moved with the easy 
stride of one who had known hard 
marches. 

Lewis came out of the tangled 
mass of trees that once had been 
an orchard. A few trees, twisted 
and gnarled and gray with age, 
still bore their pitiful and bitter 
crop of apples. 

He stopped at the edge , of the 
copse and stood for a moment 
to stare up at the house on the 
ridge above. For an instant it 
seemed to him the house stood 
in a special light, as if a rare and 
more distilled essence of the sun 
had crossed the gulf of space to 
shine upon this house and to set 
it apart from all other houses 
in the world. Bathed in that light, 
the house was somehow un- 



16 



GALAXY 



earthly, as if it, indeed, might be 
set apart as a very special thing. 
And then the light, if it ever had 
been there, was gone and the 
house shared the common sun- 
light of the fields and woods. 

Lewis shook his head and told 
himself that it had been foolish- 
ness, or, perhaps, a trick of seeing. 
For there was no such thing as 
special sunlight. The house was 
no more than a house, although 
wondrously preserved. 

TT WAS the kind of house one 
■*- did not see too often in these 
days. It was rectangular; long 
and narrow and high, with old- 
fashioned gingerbread along the 
eaves and gables. It had a certain 
gauntness that had nothing to 
do with age. It had been gaunt 
the day it was built. Gaunt and 
plain and strong, like the people 
that it sheltered. 

But gaunt as it might be, it 
stood prim and neat, with no 
peeling paint, with no sign of 
weathering, and no hint of decay. 

Against one end of it was a 
smaller building, no more than 
a shed, as if it were an alien struc- 
ture that had been carted in from 
some other place and shoved 
against its end, covering the side 
door of the house. Perhaps the 
door, thought Lewis, that led into 
the kitchen. The shed undoubt- 
edly had been used as a place 
to hang outdoor clothing and to 



leave overshoes and boots, with 
a bench for milk cans and buck- 
ets, and, perhaps, a basket in 
which to gather eggs. From the 
top of it extended three feet of 
stovepipe. 

Lewis went up to the house 
and around the shed. And there, 
in the side of it, was a door ajar. 
He stepped up on the stoop, 
pushed the door wide open and 
stared in amazement at the room. 

For it was not a simple shed. 
It, apparently, was the place 
where Wallace lived. 

The stove from which the 
stovepipe projected stood in one 
corner. It was an ancient cook 
stove, smaller than the old-fash- 
ioned kitchen range. Sitting on 
its top was a coffee pot, a frying 
pan and a griddle. Hung from 
hooks on a board behind it were 
other cooking implements. Oppo- 
site the stove, shoved against the 
wall, was a three-quarter size 
four-poster bed, covered with a 
lumpy quilt, quilted in one of 
the ornate patterns of many 
pieces of many-colored cloth that 
had been the delight of ladies of 
a century before. In another cor- 
ner was a table and a chair. Above 
the table, against the wall, hung 
a small open cupboard in which 
were stacked some dishes. On the 
table stood a kerosene lantern, 
battered from much usage, but 
with its chimney clean, as if it 
had been washed and polished as 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



17 



recently as this morning, the wick 
neatly trimmed. 

There was no door into the 
house, no sign there had ever 
been a door. The clapboard of 
the house’s outer wall ran un- 
broken to form the fourth wall 
of the shed. 

This was incredible, Lewis told 
himself — that there should be 
no door, that Wallace should live 
here, in this shed, when there was 
a house to live in. As if there were 
some reason he should not oc- 
cupy the house, and yet must 
stay close by it. Or perhaps as 
though he were living out a pen- 
ance of some sort, living here in 
this shed as a medieval hermit 
might have lived in a woodland 
hut or in a desert cave. 

He stood in the center of the 
shed and looked around him, hop- 
ing that he might find some clue 
to this unusual circumstance. But 
there was nothing, beyond the 
bare, hard fact of living. Just the 
very basic necessities — the stove 
to cook his food and heat the 
place, the bed to sleep on, the 
table to eat on and the lantern 
for its light. Not even so much 
as an extra hat (although, come 
to think of it, Wallace never wore 
a hat) or an extra coat. 

No sign of magazines or pa- 
pers, and Wallace never came 
home from the mailbox empty- 
handed. He subscribed to the 
New York Times, the Wall Street 



Journal, the Christian Science 
Monitor and the Washington 
Star, as well as many scientific 
and technical journals. But there 
was no sign of them here, nor of 
the many books he bought. No 
sign, either, of the bound record 
books. Nothing at all on which 
a man could write, nor anything 
to write with. 

1>ERHAPS, LEWIS told him- 
self, this shed, for some baf- 
fling reason, was no more than a 
show place, a place staged most 
carefully to make one think that 
this was where Wallace lived. 
Perhaps he lived in the house 
after all. Although, if that were 
the case, why all this effort, not 
too successful, to make one think 
he didn’t? 

Lewis turned to the door and 
walked out of the shed. He went 
around the house until he reached 
the porch that led up to the front 
door. At the foot of the steps, 
he stopped and looked around. 
The place was quiet. The sun 
was mid-morning high and the 
day was warming up. This shel- 
tered corner of the earth stood 
relaxed and hushed, waiting for 
the heat. 

He looked at his watch and he 
had forty minutes left, so he went 
up the steps and across the porch 
until he came to the door. Reach- 
ing out his hand, he grasped the 
knob and turned — except he 



18 



GALAXY 



didn’t turn it; the knob stayed 
exactly where it was. His 
clenched fingers went half around 
it in the motion of a turn. 

Puzzled, he tried again and 
still he didn’t turn the knob. It 
was as if the knob were covered 
with some hard, slick coating, 
like a coat of brittle ice, on which 
the fingers slipped without exert- 
ing any pressure on the knob. 

He bent his head close to the 
knob and tried to see if there 
were any evidence of coating. 
There was no evidence. The knob 
looked perfectly all right. Too all 
right, perhaps; for it was clean, 
as if someone had wiped and 
polished it. There was no dust 
upon it and no weather specks. 

He tried a thumbnail on it and 
the thumbnail slipped, but left 
no mark behind it. He ran his 
palm over the outer surface of 
the door and the wood was slick. 
The rubbing of the palm set up 
no friction. The palm slid along 
the wood as if the palm were 
greased, but there was no sign 
of grease. There was no indication 
of anything to account for the 
slickness of the door. 

Lewis moved from the door to 
the clapboard and the clapboard 
also was slick. He tried palm and 
thumbnail on it and the answer 
was the same. There was some- 
thing covering this house which 
made it slick and smooth — so 
smooth that dust could not cling 



upon its surface nor could weath- 
er stain it. 

He moved along the porch un- 
til he came to a window. And 
now, as he stood facing the win- 
dow, he realized something he 
had not noticed before, something 
that helped make the house seem 
gaunter than it really was. The 
windows were black. 

There were no curtains, no 
drapes, no shades. They were 
simply black rectangles, like emp- 
ty eyes staring out of the bare 
skull of the house. 

He moved closer to the window 
and put his face up to it, shading 
the sides of his face, next to the 
eyes, with his upheld hands to 
shield out the sunlight. But even 
so he could not see into the room 
beyond. He stared, instead, into 
a pool of blackness, and the 
blackness, curiously enough, had 
no reflective qualities. 

He could not see himself re- 
flected in the glass. He could see 
nothing but the blackness, as if 
the light hit the window and was 
absorbed by it, sucked in and held 
by it. There was no bouncing 
back of light once it had hit that 
window. 

He left the porch and went 
slowly around the house, exam- 
ining it as he went. The windows 
were all blank, black pools that 
sucked in the captured light and 
all the exterior was slick and 
hard. 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



19 




TTE POUNDED the clapboard 
with his fist. It was like 
pounding a rock. He examined 
the stone walls of the basement 
where they were exposed, and 
the walls were smooth and slick. 
There were mortar gaps between 
the stones and in the stones them- 
selves one could see uneven sur- 
faces. But the hand rubbed across 
the wall could detect no rough- 
ness. 

An invisible something had 
been laid over the roughness of 
the stone, just enough of it to fill 
in the pits and uneven surfaces. 
But one could not detect it. It 
was almost as if it had no sub- 
stance. 

Straightening up from his ex- 



amination of the wall, Lewis 
looked at his watch. There were 
only ten minutes left. He must 
be getting on. 

He walked down the hill to- 
ward the tangle of old orchard. 
At its edge, he stopped and 
looked back and now the house 
was different. It was no longer 
just a structure. It wore a per- 
sonality, a mocking, leering look 
and there was a malevolent 
chuckle bubbling inside of it, 
ready to break out. 

Lewis ducked into the orchard 
and worked his way in among the 
trees. There was no path and be- 
neath the trees the grass and 
weeds grew tall. He ducked the 
drooping branches and walked 



around a tree that had been up- 
rooted in some windstorm of 
many years before. 

He reached up as he went 
along, picking an apple here and 
there, scrubby things and sour. 
He took a single bite out of each 
one of them, then threw them 
away; for there were none of 
them that was fit to eat, as if 
they might have taken from the 
neglected soil a certain basic bit- 
terness. 

At the far side of the orchard 
he found the fence and the graves 
that it enclosed. 

Here the weeds and grass were 
not so high and the fence showed 
signs of repair made rather re- 
cently. At the foot of each grave, 



opposite the three crude native 
limestone headstones, was a peo- 
ny bush, each of them a great 
straggling mass of plants that had 
grown undisciplined for years. 

Standing before the weathered 
picketing, he knew that he had 
stumbled on the Wallace family 
burial plot. 

But there should have been 
only the two stones. What about 
the third? 

He moved around the fence 
to the sagging gate and went into 
the plot. Standing at the foot of 
the graves, he read the legends 
on the stone. The carving was 
angular and rough, giving evi- 
dence of having been executed 
by unaccustomed hands. There 



GALAXY

were no pious phrases, no lines 
of verse, no carvings of angels or 
of lambs or of other symbolic fig- 
ures such as had been in the 
vogue in the 1860s. There were 
just the names and dates. 

On the first stone: Amanda 
Wallace 1821-1863 

And on the second stone : Jede- 
diah Wallace 1816-1866 

And on the third stone —

Ui^IVE ME THAT pencil, 
please,” said Lewis. 

Hardwicke quit rolling it be- 
tween his palms and handed it 
across. 

“Paper, too?” he asked. 

“If you please,” said Lewis. 

He bent above the desk and 
drew rapidly. 

“Here,” he said, handing back 
the paper. 

Hardwicke wrinkled his brow. 

“But it makes no sense,” he 
said. “Except for that figure un- 
derneath.” 

“The figure eight, lying on its 
side. Yes, I know. The symbol 
for infinity.” 

“But the rest of it?” 

“I don’t know,” said Lewis. “It 
is the inscription on the tomb- 
stone. I copied it ... ” 

“And you know it now by 
heart.” 

“I should. I’ve studied it 
enough.” 



“I’ve never seen anything like 
it in my life,” said Hardwicke. 
“Not that I’m an authority. I 
really know little at all in this 
field.” 

“You can put your mind at 
rest. It’s nothing that anyone 
knows anything about. It bears 
no resemblance, not even the 
remotest, to any language or any 
known inscription. I checked with 
men who know. Not one, but a 
dozen of them. I told them I’d 
found it on a rocky cliff. I am 
sure that most of them think I am 
a crackpot. One of those people 
who are trying to prove that the 
Romans or the Phoenicians or 
the Irish or whatnot had pre- 
Columbian settlements in Amer- 
ica.” 

Hardwicke put down the sheet 
of paper. 

“I can see what you mean,” 
he said, “when you say you have 
more questions now than when 
you started. Not only the ques- 
tion of a young man more than 
a century old, but likewise the 
matter of the slickness of the 
house and the third gravestone 
with the undecipherable inscrip- 
tion. You say you’ve never talked 
with Wallace?” 

“No one talks to him except 
the mailman. He goes out on his 
daily walks and he packs this 
gun.” 

“People are afraid to talk with 
him?” 



22 



GALAXY 



“Because of the gun, you 
mean?” 

“Well, yes, I suppose that was 
in the back of my mind. I won- 
dered why he carried it.” 

T EWIS SHOOK his head. “I 
don’t know. I’ve tried to tie 
it in, to find some reason he al- 
ways has it with him. He has 
never fired the rifle so far as I 
can find. But I don’t think the 
rifle is the reason no one talks 
with him. He’s an anachronism, 
something living from another 
age. No one fears him, I am sure 
of that. He’s been around too 
long for anyone to fear him. Too 
familiar. He’s a fixture of the 
land, like a tree or boulder. And 
yet no one feels quite comfortable 
with him, either, I would imagine 
that most of them, if they should 
come face to face with him, would 
feel uncomfortable. For he’s 
something they are not. Some- 
thing greater than they are, and 
at the same time a good deal less. 
As if he were a man who had 
walked away from his own hu- 
manity. I think that secretly 
many of his neighbors may be a 
bit shamed by him, shamed be- 
cause he has, somehow, perhaps 
ignobly, sidestepped growing old 
— one of the penalties, but per- 
haps also one of the rights of all 
humankind. And perhaps this 
secret shame may contribute in 
some part to their unwillingness 



to talk about him to strangers 
like us.” 

“You spent a good deal of time 
watching him?” 

“There was a time I did. But 
now I have a crew. They watch 
on regular shifts. We have a 
dozen spots we watch from and 
we keep shifting them around. 
There isn’t an hour, day in, day 
out, that the Wallace house isn’t 
under observation.” 

“This business really has you 
people bugged.” 

“I think with reason,” Lewis 
said. “There is still one other 
thing.” 

He bent over and picked up 
the briefcase he had placed be- 
side his chair. Unsnapping it, he 
took out a sheaf of photographs 
and handed them to Hardwicke. 

“What do you make of these?” 
he asked. 

Hardwicke picked them up. 
Suddenly he froze. The color 
drained out of his face. His hands 
began to tremble and he laid the 
pictures carefully on the desk. 
He had looked at only the top 
one; not any of the others. 

Lewis saw the question in his 
face. 

“In the grave,” he said. “The 
one beneath the headstone with 
the funny writing.” 

r I ^HE MESSAGE machine whis- 
led shrilly. Enoch Wallace put 
away the book in which he had 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



23 



been writing and got up from his 
desk. 

He walked across the room 
to the whistling machine. He 
punched a button and shoved a 
key and the whistling stopped. 

The machine built up its hum 
and the message began to form 
on the plate, faint at first and 
then becoming darker until to 
stood out clearly. It read: 

NO. 406301 TO STATION 
18327. TRAVELER AT 16097.- 
38. NATIVE THUBAN VI. NO 
BAGGAGE. NO. 3 LIQUID 
TANK. SOLUTION 27. DE- 
PART FOR STATION 12892 
AT 16439.16. CONFIRM. 

Enoch glanced up at the great 
galactic chronometer hanging on 
the wall. There was almost three 
hours to go. 

He touched a button and a 
thin sheet of metal, bearing the 
message, protruded from the side 
of the machine. Beneath it, the 
duplicate fed itself into the rec- 
ord file. The machine chuckled 
and the message plate was clear 
once more and waiting. 

Enoch pulled out the metal 
plate, threaded the holes in it 
through the double filing spindle 
and then dropped his fingers to 
the keyboard and typed: NO. 
406301 RECEIVED. CONFIRM 
MOMENTARILY. The message 
came into being on the plate and 
he left it there. 

Thuban VI? Had there been, 



he wondered, one of them be- 
fore? As soon as he got his chores 
done, he would go to the filing 
cabinet and check. 

It was a liquid-tank case and 
those, as a rule, were the most 
uninteresting of all. They usually 
were hard ones to strike up a 
conversation with, because too 
often their concept of language 
was too difficult to handle. And, 
as often, too, their very thinking 
processes proved too divergent 
to provide much common ground 
for communication. 

Although, he recalled, that was 
not always true. There had been 
that tank traveler several years 
ago, from somewhere in Hydra 
(or had it been the Hyades?) 
he’d sat up the whole night with 
and almost failed of sending off 
on time, yarning through the 
hours, their communication (you 
couldn’t call it words) tumbling 
over one another as they packed 
into the little time they had a 
lot of fellowship and, perhaps, 
some brotherhood. 

He, or she, or it — they’d 
never got around to that — had 
not come back again. And that 
was the way it was, thought 
Enoch. Very few came back. By 
far the greater part of them were 
just passing through. 

T>UT ENOCH had him, or her, 
or it (whichever it might 
be) down in black and white. In

GALAXY 



fact he had all of them, every 
single blessed one of them, down 
in black and white. It had taken 
him, he remembered, almost the 
entire following day, crouched 
above his desk, to get it written 
down; all the stories he’d been 
told, all the glimpses he had 
caught of a far and beautiful and 
tantalizing land (tantalizing be- 
cause there was so much of it 
he could not understand), all the 
warmth and comradeship that 
had flowed between himself and 
this misshapen, twisted, ugly liv- 
ing being from another world. 
And any time he wished, any 
day he wished, he could take 
down the journal from the row 
of journals and relive that night 
again. Although he never had. It 
was strange, he thought, how 
there was never time, or never 
seemed to be the time, to thumb 
through and re-read in part what 
he’d recorded through the years. 

He turned from the message 
machine and rolled a No. 3 liquid 
tank into place beneath the ma- 
terializer, positioning it exactly 
and locking it in place. Then he 
pulled out the retracting hose and 
thumbed the selector over to No. 
27. He filled the tank and let the 
hose slide back into the wall. 

Back at the machine, he 
cleared the plate and sent off his 
confirmation that all was ready 
for the traveler from Thuban. 
He got back re-confirmation from 



the other end, then threw the 
machine to neutral, ready to re- 
ceive again. 

He went from the machine to 
the filing cabinet that stood next 
to his desk and pulled out a 
drawer jammed with filing cards. 
He looked and Thuban VI was 
there, keyed to August 22, 1931. 
He walked across the room to 
the wall filled with books and 
rows of magazines and journals, 
filled from floor to ceiling, and 
found the record book he wanted. 
Carrying it, he walked back to 
his desk. 

August 22, 1931, he found, 
when he located the entry, had 
been one of his lighter days. 
There had been one traveler 
only, the one from Thuban VI. 
And although the entry for the 
day filled almost a page in his 
small, crabbed writing, he had de- 
voted no more than one para- 
graph to the visitor. 

Came today, it read, a blob 
from Thuban VI. There is no 
other way in which one might 
describe it. It is simply a mass of 
matter, presumably of flesh, and 
this mass seems to go through 
some sort of rhythmic change in 
shape, for periodically it is globu- 
lar, then begins to flatten out un- 
til it lies in the bottom of the 
tank, somewhat like a pancake. 
Then it begins to contract and 
to pull in upon itself, until finally 
it is a ball again. This change is

rather slow and definitely rhyth- 
mic, but only in the sense that 
it follows the same pattern. It 
seems to have no relation to 
time. I tried timing it and could 
detect no time pattern. The 
shortest period needed to com- 
plete the cycle was seven minutes 
and the longest was eighteen. 
Perhaps over a longer period one 
might be able to detect a time 
rhythm, but I didn’t have the 
time. The semantic translator did 
not work with it, but it did emit 
for me a series of sharp clicks, 
as if it might be clicking claws 
together, although it had no claws 
that I could see. When I looked 
this up in the pasimology manual 
I learned that what it was trying 
to say was that it was all right, 
that it needed no attention, and 
please leave it alone. Which I did 
thereafter. 

And at the end of the para- 
graph, jammed into the little 
space that had been left, was the 
notation: See Oct. 16, 1931. 

TTE TURNED the pages until 
he came to October 16 and 
that had been one of the days, 
he saw, that Ulysses had arrived 
to inspect the station. 

His name, of course, was not 
Ulysses. As a matter of fact, he 
had no name at all. Among his 
people there was no need of 
names; there was other identify- 
ing terminology which was far 



more expressive than mere 
names. But this terminology, 
even the very concept of it, was 
such that it could not be grasped, 
much less put to use, by human 
beings. 

“I shall call you Ulysses,” 
Enoch recalled telling him, that 
first time they had met. “I need 
to call you something.” 

“It is agreeable,” said the then 
strange being (but no longer 
strange). “Might one ask why 
the name Ulysses?” 

“Because it is the name of a 
great man of my race.” 

“I am glad you chose it,” said 
the newly-christened being. “To 
my hearing it has a dignified and 
noble sound and, between the 
two of us, I shall be glad to bear 
it. And I shall call you Enoch, 
for the two of us shall work to- 
gether for many of your years.” 
And it had been many years, 
thought Wallace, with the record 
book open to that October entry 
of more than thirty years ago. 
Years that had been satisfying 
and enriching in a way that one 
could not have imagined until it 
had all been laid out before him. 

And it would go on, he thought, 
much longer than it already had 
gone on. For many centuries 
more. For a thousand years, per- 
haps. And at the end of that 
thousand years, what would he 
know then? 

Although, perhaps, he thought, 



26 



GALAXY 



the knowing was not the most 
important part of it. 

And none of it, he knew, might 
come to pass, for there was inter- 
ference now. There were watch- 
ers, or at least a watcher. The 
fellow who posed as a ginseng 
hunter. Before too long whoever 
it might be might start closing in. 
What he’d do or how he’d meet 
the threat, he had no idea until 
that moment came. It was some- 
thing that had been bound to 
happen. It was something he had 
been prepared to have happen 
all these years. There was reason 
to wonder that it had not hap- 
pened sooner. 

He had told Ulysses of the 
danger of it that first day they’d 
met. He’d been sitting on the 
steps that led up to the porch, 
and thinking of it now, he could 
remember it as clearly as if it had 
been only yesterday. 

IV 

TTE WAS sitting on the steps 
and it was late afternoon. 
He was watching the great, white 
thunderheads that were piling up 
across the river beyond the Iowa 
hills. 

The day was hot and sultry, 
without a breath of moving air. 
Out in the barnyard a half 
a dozen bedraggled chickens 
scratched listlessly, for the sake 
of going through the motions, it 



seemed, rather than from any 
hope of finding food. The sound 
of the sparrows’ wings, as they 
flew between the gable of the barn 
and the hedge of honeysuckle 
that bordered the field beyond 
the road, was harsh and dry 
sound, as if their feathers had 
grown stiff in the heat. 

And here he sat, he thought, 
staring at the thunderheads when 
there was work to do. Corn to be 
plowed. Hay to be gotten in. 
Wheat soon to put in shock. 

For, despite whatever might 
have happened, a man still had 
a life to live. Days had to be got- 
ten through the best that one 
could manage. It was a lesson, he 
reminded himself, that he should 
have learned in all its fullness 
in the last few years. But war 
was somehow different than what 
had happened here. In war you 
knew it and expected it. You 
were ready when it happened; 
but this was not the war. This 
was the peace to which he had 
returned. 

A man had a right to expect 
that in the world of peace there 
really would be peace, fencing 
out the violence and the horror. 

Now he was alone, as he’d 
never been alone before. Now, if 
ever, could be a new beginning. 
Perhaps now there had to be a 
new beginning. But whether it 
was here, on the homestead acres, 
or in some other place, it still 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



27 



would be a beginning of bitter- 
ness and anguish. 

He sat on the steps, with his 
wrists resting on his knees, and 
watched the thunderheads piling 
in the west. It might mean rain. 
The land could use the rain. Or 
it might be nothing, for above 
the merging river valleys the air 
currents were erratic. There was 
no way a man could tell where 
those clouds might flow. 

He did not see the traveler 
until he turned in at the gate. 
He was tall and gangling, and 
his clothes were dusty. From the 
appearance of him he had walked 
a far way. He came up the path 
and Enoch sat waiting for him, 
watching him but not stirring 
from the steps. 

“Good day, sir,” Enoch finally 
said. “It’s a hot day to be walk- 
ing. Why don’t you sit a while?” 

“Quite willingly,” said the 
stranger. “But first, I wonder, 
could I have a drink of water?” 

Enoch got up to his feet. “Come 
along. I’ll pump a fresh one for 
you.” 

He went down across the barn- 
yard until he reached the pump. 
He unhooked the dipper from 
where it hung upon a bolt and 
handed it to the man. He grasped 
the handle of the pump and 
worked it up and down. 

“Let it run a while,” he said. 
“It takes a time for it to get real 
cool.” 



The water splashed out of the 
spout, running on the boards that 
formed the cover of the well. It 
came in spurts as Enoch worked 
the handle. 

“Do you think,” the stranger 
asked, “that it is about to rain?” 

“A man can’t tell,” said Enoch. 
“We have to wait and see.” 

fT'HERE WAS something about 
-*■ this traveler that disturbed 
him. Nothing, actually, that one 
could put a finger on, but a cer- 
tain strangeness that was vaguely 
disquieting. He watched him nar- 
rowly as he pumped and decided 
that probably this stranger’s ears 
were just a bit too pointed at the 
top. Then he put it down to his 
imagination, for when he looked 
again they seemed to be all right. 

“I think,” said Enoch, “that 
the water should be cold by now.” 

The traveler put down the dip- 
per and waited for it to fill. He 
offered it to Enoch. Enoch shook 
his head. 

“You first. You need it worse 
than I do.” 

The stranger drank greedily 
and with much slobbering. 

“Another one?” asked Enoch. 

“No, thank you,” said the stran- 
ger. “But I’ll catch another dip- 
per full for you, if you wish me 
to.” 

Enoch pumped and when the 
dipper was full, the stranger 
handed it to him. The water was 



28 



GALAXY 



V 





cold. Enoch, realizing for the first 
time that he had been thirsty, 
drank it almost to the bottom. 

He hung the dipper back on its 
bolt and said to the man: “Now, 
let’s get in that sitting.” 

The stranger grinned. “I could 
do with some of it,” he said. 

Enoch pulled a red bandanna 
from his pocket and mopped his 
face. “The air gets close,” he said, 
“just before a rain.” 

And as he mopped his face, 
quite suddenly he knew what it 
was that had disturbed him about 
the traveler. 

Despite his bedraggled clothes 
and his dusty shoes, which at- 
tested to long walking, despite 
the heat of this time-before-a- 
rain, the stranger was not sweat- 
ing. He appeared as fresh and 
cool as if he had been lying at 
his ease beneath a tree in spring- 
time. 

Enoch put the bandanna back 
into his pocket. They walked 
back to the steps and sat there, 
side by side. 

“You’ve traveled a far way,” 
said Enoch, gently prying. 

“Very far, indeed,” the stranger 
told him. “I’m a right smart piece 
from home.” 

“And you have a far way yet to 
go?” 

“No,” the stranger said, “I be- 
lieve that I have got to the place 
where I am going.” 

“You mean ...” asked Enoch, 



and left the question hanging. 

“I mean right here,” said the 
stranger, “sitting on these steps. 
I have been looking for a man 
and I think that man is you. I 
did not know his name nor where 
to look for him, but yet I knew 
that one day I would find him, 
and now I have.” 

6 4 "OUT ME,” Enoch said, as- 
tonished. “Why should you 
look for me?” 

“I was looking for a man of 
many different parts. One of the 
things about him was that he 
must have looked up at the stars 
and wondered what they were.” 

“Yes,” said Enoch, “that is 
something I have done. On many 
nights, camping in the field, I 
have lain in my blankets and 
looked up at the sky, looking at 
the stars and wondering what 
they were and how they’d been 
put up there and, most important 
of all, why they had been put up 
there. I have heard some way 
that each of them is another sun 
like the sun that shines on Earth. 
But I don’t know about that. I 
guess there is no one who knows 
too much about them.” 

“There are some,” the stranger 
said, “who know a deal about 
them.” 

“You, perhaps,” said Enoch, 
mocking just a little, for the 
stranger did not look like a man 
who’d know much of anything. 



30 



GALAXY 



“Yes, I,” the stranger said. "Al- 
though I do not know as much 
as many others do.” 

Enoch said, “I’ve sometimes 
wondered if the stars are other 
suns, might there not be other 
planets and other people, too.” 

He remembered sitting around 
the campfire of a night, jawing 
with the other fellows to pass 
away the time. And once he’d 
mentioned this idea of maybe 
other people on other planets cir- 
cling other suns. And the fellows 
all had jeered him and for days 
afterwards had made fun of him, 
so he had never mentioned it 
again. Not that it mattered much, 
for he had no real belief in it him- 
self. It had never been more than 
campfire speculation. 

And now he’d mentioned it 
again and to an utter stranger. 
He wondered why he had. 

“You believe that?” asked the 
stranger. 

Enoch said: “It was just an 
idle notion.” 

“Not so idle,” said the stran- 
ger. “There are other planets and 
there are other people. I am one 
of them.” 

“But you ...” cried Enoch, 
then was stricken into silence. 

For the stranger’s face had split 
and began to fall away and be- 
neath it he caught the glimpse 
of another face that was not a 
human face. 

And even as the false human 



face sloughed off that other face, 
a great sheet of lightning went 
crackling across the sky and the 
heavy crash of thunder seemed 
to shake the land, and from far 
off he heard the rushing of the 
rain as it charged across the hills. 

V 

T^HAT WAS how it started, 

Enoch though, almost a hun- 
dred years ago. The campfire 
fantasy had turned into solid fact. 

The Earth now was on galac- 
tic charts, a way station for many 
different peoples traveling star 
to star. Strangers once, but now 
there were no strangers. There 
were no such things as strangers. 
In whatever form, with whatever 
purpose, all of them were people. 

He looked back at the entry 
for Oct. 16, 1931 and ran through 
it swiftly. There, near the end of 
it was the sentence: Ulysses says 
the Thubans from planet VI are 
perhaps the greatest mathema- 
ticians in the galaxy. It seems 
they have developed a numera- 
tion system superior to any in 
existence, especially valuable in 
the handling of statistics. 

He closed the book and sat 
quietly in the chair, wondering 
if the statisticians of Mizar X 
knew of the Thubans’ work. Per- 
haps they did, he thought. Cer- 
tainly some of the math they used 
was unconventional. 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



31 



He pushed the record book to 
one side and dug into a desk 
drawer, bringing out his chart. 
He spread it flat on the desk be- 
fore him and puzzled over it. If 
he could be sure, he thought. If 
he only knew the Mizar statistics 
better. For the last ten years or 
more he had labored at the chart, 
checking and rechecking all the 
factors against the Mizar system, 
testing again and again to deter- 
mine whether the factors he was 
using were the ones he should be 
using. 

He raised a clenched fist and 
hammered at the desk. If he only 
could be certain! If he could only 
talk with someone. 

But that had been something 
that he had shrank from doing, 
for it would be equivalent to 
showing the very nakedness of 
the human race. 

He still was human. Funny, 
he thought, that he should stay 
human, that in a century of asso- 
ciation with these beings from 
the many stars he should have, 
through it all, remained a man of 
Earth. 

For in many ways, his ties with 
Earth were cut. Old Winslowe 
Grant was the only human he 
ever talked with now. His neigh- 
bors shunned him. There were 
no others, unless one could count 
the watchers, and those he seldom 
saw — only glimpses of them, 
only the places they had been. 



Only old Winslowe Grant and 
Mary and the other people from 
the shadow who came occasion- 
ally to spend lonely hours with 
him. 

That was all of Earth he had. 
Old Winslowe and the shadow 
people and the homestead acres 
that lay outside the house — but 
not the house itself, for the house 
was alien now. 

TTE SHUT his eyes and re- 
membered how the house 
had been in the olden days. 

There had been a kitchen, in 
this same area where he was sit- 
ting, with the iron cook stove, 
black and monstrous, in its cor- 
ner, showing its row of fiery teeth 
along the slit made by the grate. 
Pushed against the wall had been 
the table where the three of them 
used to eat. He could remember 
how that table looked, with the 
vinegar cruet and the glass that 
held the spoons and the lazy 
Susan with the mustard, horse- 
radish and chili sauce sitting in 
a group, a sort of centerpiece in 
the middle of the red checkered 
cloth that the table wore. 

There had been a winter night 
when he had been, it seemed, no 
more than three or four. His 
mother was busy at the stove 
with supper. He was sitting on 
the floor in the center of the 
kitchen, playing with some 
blocks, and outside he could hear 



32 



GALAXY 



the muffled howling of the wind 
as it prowled along the eaves. 
His father had come in from 
milking at the barn, and a gust 
of wind and a swirl of snow had 
come into room with him. Then 
he’d shut the door and the wind 
and snow were gone, shut out- 
side this house, condemned to 
the outer darkness and the wil- 
derness of night. His father had 
set the pail of milk that he had 
been carrying on the kitchen sink 
and Enoch saw that his beard 
and eyebrows were coated with 
snow and there was frost on the 
whiskers all around his mouth. 

He held that picture still, the 
three of them like historic man- 
nikins posed in a cabinet in a 
museum — his father with the 
frost upon his whiskers and the 
great felt boots that came up to 
his knees; his mother with her 
face flushed from working at the 
stove and the lace cap upon her 
head; and himself upon the floor, 
playing with the blocks. 

There was one other thing that 
he remembered, perhaps more 
clearly than all the rest of it. 
There was a great lamp sitting 
on the table. On the wall behind 
it hung a calendar and the glow 
of the lamp fell like a spotlight 
upon the picture on the calendar. 

There was Old Santa Claus, 
riding in his sleigh through a 
woodland track and all the little 
woodland people had turned out 



to watch him pass. A great moon 
hung above the trees and there 
was thick snow on the ground. 
A pair of rabbits sat there, gazing 
soulfully at Santa, and a deer 
beside the rabbits, with a raccoon 
just a little distance off, ringed 
tail wrapped about his feet, and 
a squirrel and chickadee side by 
side upon an overhanging branch. 
Old Santa had his whip raised 
high in greeting. His cheeks were 
red and his smile was merry, and 
the reindeer hitched to his sled 
were fresh and spirited and 
proud. 

Through all the years this mid- 
nineteenth century Santa had rid- 
den down the snowy aisles of 
time, with his whip uplifted in 
happy greeting to the woodland 
creatures. And the golden lamp- 
light had ridden with him, still 
bright upon the wall and the 
checkered table cloth. 

So, thought Enoch, some things 
do endure — the memory of the 
snug warmness of a childhood 
kitchen on a stormy winter night. 

¥>UT THE endurance was of 
the spirit and the mind, for 
nothing else endured. There was 
no kitchen now, nor no sitting 
room with its old-fashioned sofa 
and the rocking chair; no back 
parlor with its stuffy elegance of 
brocade and silk, no guest bed- 
room on the first and no family 
bedrooms on the second floor. 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



33 



It all was gone. Only one room 
remained. 

The second story floor and all 
partitions had been stripped 
away. Now the house was one 
great room. One side of it was 
the galactic station. The other 
side the living space for the 
keeper of the station. There was 
a bed over in one corner, and 
a stove that worked on no prin- 
ciple known on Earth, and a re- 
frigerator that was of alien make. 
The walls were lined with cabi- 
nets and shelves, stacked with 
magazines and books and jour- 
nals. 

There was just one thing left 
from the early days, the one 
thing Enoch had not allowed the 
alien crew that had set up the 
station to strip away — the mas- 
sive old fireplace of brick and 
native stone that had stood 
against one wall of the sitting 
room. It still stood there, the one 
reminder of the days of old; the 
one thing left of Earth, with its 
great, scarred oak mantle that 
his father had carved out with a 
broadaxe from a massive log and 
smoothed by hand with plane 
and draw-shave. 

On the fireplace mantle and 
strewn on shelf and table were 
articles and artifacts that had 
no earthly origin and some no 
earthly names — the steady ac- 
cumulation through the years of 
the gifts from friendly travelers. 



Some of them were functional. 
Others were to look at only. And 
there were other things that were 
entirely useless, because they had 
little application to a member 
of the human race or were in- 
operable on Earth, and many 
others of the purpose of which 
he had no idea, accepting them, 
embarrassed, with many stum- 
bling thanks, from the well-mean- 
ing folks who had brought them 
to him. 

And on the other side of the 
room stood the intricate mass of 
machinery, reaching well up into 
the open second story, that 
wafted passengers through the 
space that stretched from star to 
star. 

An inn, he thought. A stopping 
place. A galactic crossroads. 

He rolled up the chart and put 
it back into the desk. The record 
book he put away in its proper 
place among all the other record 
books upon the shelf. 

He glanced at the galactic 
clock upon the wall, and it was 
time to go. 

TIE PUSHED the chair tight 
against the desk and shrug- 
ged into the jacket that hung 
upon the chair back. He picked 
the rifle off the supports that held 
it on the wall. Then he faced the 
wall itself and said the single 
word that he had to say. 

The wall slid silently back. He 



34 



GALAXY 



stepped through it into the little 
shed with its sparse furnishings. 
Behind him the section of the 
wall slid closed and there was 
nothing there to indicate it was 
anything but a solid wall. 

Enoch stepped out of the shed. 
It was a beautiful late summer 
day. In a few weeks now, he 
thought, there’d be the signs of 
autumn and a strange chill in 
the air. The first goldenrods were 
blooming now, and he’d noticed, 
just the day before, that some 
of the early asters down in the 
ancient fence row had started to 
show color. 

He went around the corner of 
the house and headed toward the 
river, striding down the long de- 
serted field that was overrun with 
hazel brush and occasional 
clumps of trees. 

This was the Earth, he thought 
— a planet made for Man. But 
not for Man alone, for it was as 
well a planet for the fox and owl 
and weasel, for the snake, the 
katydid, the fish, for all the other 
teeming life that filled the air and 
earth and water. And not these 
natives alone, but for other be- 
ings that called other earths their 
home, other planets that, far 
light-years distant, were basically 
the same as Earth. For Ulysses 
and the Hazers and all the rest 
of them who could live upon this 
planet, if need be, if they wished, 
with no discomfort and no arti- 



ficial aids, as readily as they had 
been born here. 

Our horizons are so far, he 
thought, and we see so little of 
them. Even now, with flaming 
rockets striving from Canaveral 
to break the ancient bonds, we 
dream so little of them. 

The ache was there. The ache 
that had been growing, the ache 
to tell all mankind those things 
that he had learned. Not so much 
the specific things, although there 
were some of them that mankind 
well could use, but the general 
things — the unspecific, central 
fact that there was intelligence 
throughout the universe. That 
Man was not alone; that if he 
only found the way he need never 
be alone again. 

He went down across the field 
and through the strip of woods 
and came out on the great out- 
thrust of rock that stood atop 
the cliff that faced the river. He 
stood there, as he had stood on 
thousands of other mornings, and 
stared out at the river, sweeping 
in majestic blue and silver 
through the wooded bottom-land. 

Old, ancient water, he said, 
talking silently to the river, you 
have seen it happen — the mile- 
high faces of the glaciers that 
came and stayed and left, creep- 
ing back toward the pole inch by 
stubborn inch, carrying the melt- 
ing water from those very gla- 
ciers in a flood that filled this

valley with a tide such as now 
is never known; the mastodon 
and the sabre-tooth and the bear- 
sized beaver that ranged these 
olden hills and made the night 
clamorous with trumpeting and 
screaming; the silent little bands 
of men who trotted in the woods 
or clambered up the cliffs or 
paddled on your surface, woods- 
wise and water-wise, weak in 
body, strong in purpose, and per- 
sistent in a way no other thing 
ever was persistent, and just a 
little time ago that other breed 
of men who carried dreams with- 
in their skulls and cruelty in their 
hands and the awful sureness of 
an even greater purpose in their 
hearts. And before that, for this 
is ancient country beyond what 
is often found, the other kinds 
of life and the many turns of 
climate and the changes that 
came upon the Earth itself. And 
what think you of it? he asked 
the river. For yours is the mem- 
ory and the perspective and the 
time. By now you should have 
the answers. Or at least some of 
the answers. 

As Man might have some of 
the answers had he lived for sev- 
eral million years — as he might 
have the answers several million 
years from this very summer 
morning, if he still should be 
around. 

I could help, thought Enoch. 
I could not give the answers, but 



I could help Man in his scramble 
after them. I could give him 
faith and hope and I could give 
purpose such as he has not had 
before. 

But he knew he dared not do 
it.

way of the river. The air was so | 
clear that Enoch imagined, if he I 
strained his eyes a little, he could ; 
see every feather in those out- j 
spread wings. 

There was almost a fairy qual- 
ity to this place, he thought. The 
far look and the clear air. The ; 
feeling of detachment that I 
touched almost on greatness of 
the spirit. As if this were a spe- 
cial place, one of those special 
places that each man must seek 
out for himself, and count him- ] 
self as lucky if he ever found it; I 
for there were those who sought 
and never found it. Worst of all, 
there were even those who never 
hunted for it. 

He stood upon the rock and 
stared out across the river, watch- 
ing the lazy hawk and the sweep 
of water and the green carpeting 
of trees. His mind went up and 
out to those other places until 
his mind was dizzy with the 
thought of it. And then he called 
it home. 

He turned slowly and went 
back down the rock and moved 



36

off among the trees, following the 
path he’d beaten through the 
years. 

He considered going down the 
hill a ways to look in on the patch 
of pink lady slippers, to see how 
they might be coming, to try to 
conjure up the beauty that would 
be his again in June, but decided 
that there’d be little point to it. 
They were well hidden in an iso- 
lated place. Nothing could have 
harmed them. There had been a 
time, a hundred years ago, when 
they had bloomed on every hill. 
Then he had come trailing home 
with great armloads of them, 
which his mother had put in the 
great brown jug she had and for 
a day or two the house had been 
filled with the heaviness of their 
rich perfume. But they were hard 
to come by now. The trampling 
of pastured cattle and flower- 
hunting humans had swept them 
from the hills. 

Some other day, he told him- 
self, some day before first frost, 
he would visit them again to 
satisfy himself that they’d be 
there in spring. 

He stopped a while to watch a 
squirrel as it frolicked in an oak. 
He squatted down to follow a 
snail which had crossed his path. 
He stopped beside a massive tree 
and examined the pattern of the 
moss that grew upon its trunk. 
And he traced the wanderings of 
a silent, flitting songbird as it 



fluttered from tree to tree. 

He followed the path out of 
the woods and along the edge of 
field until he came to the spring 
that bubbled from the hillside. 

Sitting beside the spring was a 
woman. He recognized her as 
Lucy Fisher, the deaf-mute 
daughter of Hank Fisher who 
lived down in the river bottoms. 

TTE STOPPED and watched 
-■■■*- her and thought how full 
she was of grace and beauty, the 
natural grace and beauty of a 
primitive and lonely creature. 

She was sitting by the spring 
with one hand uplifted. She held 
in it, at the tips of long and sensi- 
tive fingers, something that 
glowed with color. Her head was 
held alert and high, and her 
slender body had the same al- 
most startled look of quiet alert- 
ness. 

Enoch moved slowly forward 
and stopped, not mofe than three 
feet behind her. 

The thing of color on her fin- 
gertips was one of those large 
gold and red butterflies that come 
with the end of summer. One wing 
of the insect stood erect and 
straight, but the other was bent 
and crumpled and had lost some 
of the dust that lent sparkle to 
the color. 

She was not actually holding 
the butterfly. It was standing on 
one fingertip, the one good wing 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



37 




I 



fluttering very slightly every now 
and then to maintain its balance. 

But perhaps he had been mis- 
taken in thinking that the second 
wing was injured, for now he 
could see that somehow 'it had 
been simply bent and distorted. 
Now it was straightening slowly. 
The dust (if it ever had been 
gone) was back on it again, and 
it was standing up with the other 
wing. 

He stepped around the girl, 
and when she saw him there was 
no start of surprise. That would 
be quite natural. She must be 
accustomed to it — someone 
coming up behind her and sud- 
denly being there. 

Her eyes were radiant, as if 
she had experienced some ecstasy 
of the soul. And he found him- 
self wondering again, as he did 
each time he saw her, what it 
must be like for her, living in a 
world of two-way silence, perhaps 
not entirely unable to communi- 
cate, but at least barred from 
that free flow of communication 
which was the birthright of the 
human animal. 

There had been, he knew, sev- 
eral attempts to establish her in 
a state school for the deaf, but 
each had been a failure. Once 
she’d run away and wandered 
days before being finally found 
and returned to her home. And 
on other occasions she had gone 
on disobedience strikes, refusing 



to co-operate in any of the teach- 
ing. 

THATCHING HER as she sat 
” there with the butterfly, 
Enoch thought he knew the rea- 
son. She had a world of her very 
own. One to which she was ac- 
customed and knew how to get 
along in. In that world she was 
no cripple, as she most surely 
would have been a cripple if she 
had been pushed, part way, into 
the normal human world. 

What good to her the hand 
alphabet or the reading of the 
lips if they should take away her 
inner serenity of spirit? 

She was a creature of the 
woods and hills, of springtime 
flower and autumn flight of birds. 
She knew these things and lived 
with them. She was, in some way, 
a part of them, one who dwelt 
apart in an old and lost apart- 
ment of the natural world. She 
occupied a place that Man long 
since had abandoned, if, in fact, 
he’d ever held it. 

And there she sat, alive, 
thought Enoch, as no other thing 
he knew had ever been alive. 

The butterfly spread its wings 
and floated off her finger. Uncon- 
cerned, unfrightened, it fluttered 
up across the wild grass and the 
goldenrod of the field. 

She pivoted to watch it until 
it disappeared, then turned to 
Enoch. She smiled and made a 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



39 




fluttery motion with her hands, 
like the fluttering of the red and 
golden wings. But there was 
something else in it, as well - — a 
sense of happiness and well- 
being, as if she might be saying 
that the world was going fine. 

If, Enoch thought, I could only 
teach her the pasimology of my 
galactic people. Then we could 
talk, the two of us, almost as well 
as with the flow of words on the 
human tongue. Given the time, 
he thought, it might not be too 
hard. There was a natural and a 
logical process to the galactic sign 
language that made it almost in- 
stinctive once one had caught the 
underlying principle. 

Throughout the Earth as well, 
in the early days, there had been 
sign languages. But Earth’s best 
was only a crutch that allowed 
a man to hobble when he couldn’t 
run. Whereas that of the galaxy 
was in itself a language, devel- 
oped through millenia, with many 
different peoples making contri- 
butions. It had been refined and 
shaken down and polished until 
today it was a communications 
tool that stood on its own merits. 

There was need for such a tool, 
for the galaxy was Babel. Even 
the galactic science of pasimo- 
logy could not surmount all the 
obstacles, could not guarantee, 
in certain cases, the basic mini- 
mum of communication. For not 
only were there millions of 



tongues, but those other lan- 
guages as well which could not 
operate on the principle of sound 
because the races were incapable 
of sound. Even sound failed when 
the race talked in ultrasonics 
others could not hear. There was 
telepathy, of course; but for every 
telepath, there were a thousand 
races, that had telepathic blocks. 
There were many who got along 
on sign languages alone and 
others who could communicate 
only by a written or pictographic 
system, including some who car- 
ried chemical blackboards built 
into their bodies. And there was 
that sightless, deaf and speech- 
less race from the mystery stars 
of the far side of the galaxy who 
used what was perhaps the most 
complicated of all the galactic 
languages — a code of signals 
routed along their nervous sys- 
tems. 

Enoch had been at the job al- 
most a century. Even so, even 
with the aid of the universal sign 
language and the semantic trans- 
lator, which was little more than 
a pitiful (although complicated) 
mechanical contrivance, he still 
was hard put at times to know 
what many of them said. 

T UCY FISHER picked up a 
cup fashioned of a strip of 
folded birch bark, dipped it in 
the spring and held it out to 
Enoch. He stepped close and 



40 



GALAXY 



knelt to drink from it. It was 
no t entirely watertight. Water 
ran from it down across his arm, 
wetting the cuff of shirt and jack- 
et. 

He finished and handed back 
the cup. She took it in one hand 
and reached out the other, to 
brush across his forehead with 
the tip of gentle fingers. 

He did not speak to her. Long 
ago he had ceased talking to her, 
sensing that the movement of 
his mouth, making sounds she 
could not hear, might be embar- 
rassing. 

Instead he put out a hand and 
laid his broad palm against her 
cheek for a moment. Then he got 
to his feet. For a moment their 
eyes looked into the other’s eyes 
and then turned away. 

He crossed the little stream 
that ran down from the spring 
and took the trail that led from 
the forest’s edge across the field, 
heading for the ridge. Halfway 
up the slope, he turned around 
and saw that she was watching 
him. He held up his hand in a 
gesture of farewell and her hand 
gestured in reply. 

It had been, he recalled, twelve 
years or more ago that he first 
had seen her, a little fairy per- 
son of ten or so, a wild thing 
running in the woods. They had 
become friends only after a long 
time, although he saw her often. 
She roamed the hills and valley 



as if they were a playground for 
her — which, of course, they 
were. 

Through the years he had 
watched her grow, often meeting 
her on his daily walks. Between 
the two of them had grown up 
the understanding of the lonely 
and the outcast, or something 
more than that. Each had a world 
that was his own, a world that 
had given him an insight into 
something that others seldom 
saw. Not that either, Enoch 
thought, ever told the other, or 
tried to tell the other, of these 
private worlds. But the fact of 
the private worlds was there, pro- 
viding a firm foundation for 
friendship. 

He recalled the day he’d found 
her at the place where the pink 
lady slippers grew, just kneeling 
there and looking at them, not 
picking any of them. He’d stop- 
ped beside her and been pleased 
she had not moved to pick them, 
knowing that in the sight of them, 
the two, he and she, had found a 
joy and a beauty that was be- 
yond possession. 

He reached the ridgetop and 
turned down the grass-grown 
road that led down to the mail- 
box. 

And he’d not been mistaken 
back there, he told himself, no 
matter how it may have seemed 
on second look. The butterfly’s 
wing had been torn and crumpled

41 



and drab from the lack of dust. 

It had been a crippled thing. 
And then it had been whole again 
and had flown away. 

VI 

WJINSLOWE GRANT was on 
time. 

As Enoch reached the mailbox, 
he sighted the dust raised by his 
old jalopy as it galloped along 
the ridge. It had been a dusty 
year, he thought. Little rain, and 
the crops had suffered. Although, 
to tell the truth, there were few 
crops on the ridge these days. 
There had been a time when 
comfortable small farms had 
existed all along the road, with 
the bams all red and the houses 
white. But now most of the farms 
had been abandoned. The houses 
and the barns were no longer red 
or white, but the gray and wea- 
thered wood, with all the paint 
peeled off and the ridgepoles sag- 
ging and the people gone. 

It would not be long before 
Winslowe would arrive. Enoch 
settled down to wait. The mail- 
man might be stopping at the 
Fisher box, just around the bend, 
although the Fishers, as a rule, 
got but little mail, mostly just 
the advertising sheets and other 
junk that was mailed out in- 
discriminately to the rural box- 
holders. Not that it mattered to 
the Fishers, for sometimes days 



went by in which they did not 
pick up their mail. If it were not 
for Lucy, they perhaps would 
never get it, for it was mostly 
Lucy who thought to pick it up. 

The Fishers were, for a fact, 
a truly shiftless outfit. Their 
house and all the buildings were 
ready to fall in upon themselves. 
They raised a grubby patch of 
corn that was drowned out, more 
often than not, by a flood rise of 
the river. They mowed some hay 
off a bottom meadow and they 
had a couple of raw-boned horses 
and a half dozen scrawny cows 
and a flock of chickens. They had 
an old clunk of a car, and a still 
hid out somewhere in the river 
bottoms, and they hunted and 
fished and trapped and were gen- 
erally no account. Still, when one 
considered it, they were not bad 
neighbors. They tended to their 
business. They never bothered 
anyone except that periodically 
they went around, the whole tribe 
of them, distributing pamphlets 
and tracts through the neighbor- 
hood for some obscure fundamen- 
talist sect that Ma Fisher had 
become a member of at a tent 
revival meeting down in Mill- 
ville several years before. 

Winslowe didn’t stop at the 
Fisher box, but came boiling 
around the bend in a cloud of 
dust. He braked the panting ma- 
chine to a halt and turned off 
the engine.

“Let her cool a while,” he said. 

The block crackled as it started 
giving up its heat. 

“You made good time today,” 
said Enoch. 

“Lots of people didn’t have any 
mail today,” said Winslowe. “Just 
went sailing past their boxes.” 

He dipped into the pouch on 
the seat beside him and brought 
out a bundle tied together with a 
bit of string for Enoch — several 
daily papers and two journals. 

“You get a lot of stuff,” said 
Winslowe, “but hardly ever let- 
ters.” 

“There is no one left who 
would want to write to me.” 

“But,” said Winslowe, “you got 
a letter this time.” 

T^NOCH LOOKED, unable to 
conceal surprise. He could 
see the end of an envelope peep- 
ing from between the journals. 

“A personal letter,” said Wins- 
lowe, almost smacking his lips. 
“Not one of them advertising 
ones.” 

Enoch tucked the bundle un- 
derneath his arm, beside the rifle 
stock. “Probably won’t amount to 
much,” he said. 

“Maybe not,” said Winslowe, a 
sly glitter in his eyes. 

He pulled a pipe and pouch 
from his pocket and slowly filled 
the pipe. The engine block con- 
tinued its crackling and popping. 
The sun beat down out of a 



cloudless sky. The vegetation 
alongside the road was coated 
with dust and an acrid smell rose 
from it. 

“Hear that ginseng fellow is 
back again,” said Winslowe, con- 
versationally, but unable to keep 
out a conspiratory tone. “Been 
gone for three, four days.” 

“Maybe off to sell his sang.” 

“You ask me,” the mailman 
said, “he ain’t hunting sang. He’s 
hunting something else.” 

“Been at it for a right smart 
time,” Enoch said. 

“First of all,” said Winslowe, 
“there’s barely any market for 
the stuff and even if there was, 
there isn’t any sang. Used to be 
a good market years ago. Chinese 
used it for medicine, I guess. But 
now there ain’t no trade with 
China.” 

He leaned back in the seat, 
puffing serenely at his pipe. 

“Funny goings-on,” he said. 

“I never saw the man,” said 
Enoch. 

“Sneaking through the woods,” 
said Winslowe. “Digging up dif- 
ferent kinds of plants. Got the 
idea myself he maybe is a sort 
of magic-man. Getting stuff to 
make up charms and such. 
Spends a lot of his time yarning 
with the Fisher tribe and drink- 
ing up their likker. You don’t 
hear much of it these days, but 
I still hold with magic. Lots of 
things science can’t explain. You

take that Fisher girl, the dummy. 
She can charm off warts.” 

“So I’ve heard,” said Enoch. 
And more than that, he 
thought. She can fix a butterfly. 

Winslowe hunched forward in 
his seat. 

“Almost forgot,” he said. “I 
have something else for you.” 

He lifted a brown paper parcel 
from the floor and handed it to 
Enoch. 

“This ain’t mail,” he said. “It’s 
something that I made for you.” 
“Why, thank you,” Enoch said, 
taking it from him. 

“Go ahead,” Winslowe said, 
“and open it up.” 

Enoch hesitated. 

“Ah, hell,” said Winslowe, 
“don’t be bashful.” 

E NOCH TORE off the paper 
and there it was, a full-figure 
wood carving of himself. It was 
in a blond, honey-colored wood 
and some twelve inches tall. It 
shone like golden crystal in the 
sun. He was walking, with his 
rifle tucked beneath his arm and 
a wind was blowing, for he was 
leaning slightly into it and there 
were wind-flutter ripples on his 
jacket and his trousers. 

Enoch gasped, then stood star- 
ing at it. 

'“Wins,” he said, “that’s the 
most beautiful piece of work I 
have ever seen.” 

“Did it,” said the mailman, 



“out of that piece of wood you 
gave me last winter. Best piece 
of whittling stuff I ever ran 
across. Hard, and without hardly 
any grain. No danger of splitting 
or nicking or shredding. When 
you make a cut, you make it 
where you want to and it stays 
the way you cut it. And it takes 
polish as you cut. Just rub it up 
a little is all you need to do.” 
“You don’t know,” said Enoch, 
“how much this means to me.” 
“Over the years,” the mailman 
told him, “you’ve given me an aw- 
ful lot of wood. Different kinds 
of wood no one’s ever see before. 
All of it top-grade stuff and beau- 
tiful. It was time I was whittling 
something for you.” 

“And you have done a lot for 
me, lugging things from town.” 
“Enoch,” Winslowe said, “I like 
you. I don’t know what you are 
and I ain’t about to ask, but, 
anyhow, I like you.” 

“I wish that I could tell you 
what I am,” said Enoch. 

“Well,” said Winslowe, moving 
over to plant himself behind the 
wheel, “it don’t matter much what 
any of us are, just so we get along 
with one another. If some of the 
nations would only take a lesson 
in how to get along from some 
small neighborhood like the 
world would be a whole lot bet- 
ter.” 

Enoch nodded gravely. “It 
doesn’t look too good, does it?” 



44 



GALAXY 



“It sure don’t,” said the mail- 
man, starting up the car. 

Enoch stood and watched the 
car move off, down the hill, build- 
ing up its cloud of dust as it 
moved along. 

Then he looked again at the 
wooden statuette of himself. 

It was as if the wooden figure 
were walking on a hilltop, naked 
to the full force of the wind and 
bent against the gale. 

Why? He wondered. What was 
it the mailman had seen in him 
to portray him as walking in the 
wind? 

H E LAID the rifle and 
the mail upon a patch of 
dusty grass and carefully re- 
wrapped the statuette in the 
piece of paper. He’d put it, 
he decided, on the mantlepiece. 
Or, perhaps better yet, on the 
coffee table that stood beside his 
favorite chair, in the corner by 
the desk. He wanted it, he ad- 
mitted to himself, with some quiet 
embarrassment, where it was 
close at hand, where he could 
look at it or pick it up any time 
he wished. And he wondered at 
the deep, soul-satisfying pleasure 
that he got from the mailman’s 
gift. 

It was not because he was sel- 
dom given gifts. Scarcely a week 
went past that the alien travelers 
did not leave several with him. 
The house was cluttered, and 



there was a wall of shelves down 
in the cavernous basement that 
were crammed with the stuff that 
had been given him. Perhaps it 
was, he told himself, because this 
was a gift from Earth. From one 
of his own kind. 

He tucked the wrapped stat- 
uette beneath his arm. Picking 
up the rifle and the mail, he 
headed back for home, following 
the brush-grown trail that once 
had been the wagon road leading 
to the farm. 

Grass had grown into thick turf 
between the ancient ruts, cut so 
deep into the clay by the iron 
tires of the old-time wagons that 
they still were no more than bare, 
impacted earth in which no plant 
as yet had gained a root-hold. 
But on each side the clumps of 
brush, creeping up the field from 
the forest’s edge, grew man-high 
or better, so that now one moved 
down an aisle of green. 

But at certain points, quite un- 
explainably — perhaps due to the 
character of the soil or to the 
mere vagaries of nature — the 
growth of brush had faltered. 
Here were vistas where one might 
look out from the ridge top across 
the river valley. 

It was from one of these van- 
tage points that Enoch caught 
the flash from a clump of trees 
at the edge of the old field, not 
too far from the spring where he 
had found Lucy. 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



45 



He frowned as he saw the flash 
and stood quietly on the path, 
waiting for a repetition. But it 
did not come again. 

It was one of the watchers, he 
knew, using a pair of binoculars 
to keep watch upon the station. 
The flash he had seen had been 
the reflection of the sun upon the 
glasses. 

VW^HO WERE they? Why 
” should they be watching? 
It had been going on for some 
time now but, strangely, there 
had been nothing but the watch- 
ing. There had been no inter- 
ference. No one had attempted 
to approach him, though such 
approach could have been quite 
simple and quite natural. If they 
— whoever they might be — had 
wished to talk with him, a casual 
meeting could have been accom- 
plished during any one of his 
morning walks. 

But apparently as yet they did 
not wish to talk. 

Then what did they want? 
Keep track of him, perhaps. In 
that regard, he thought, with a 
wry inner twinge of humor, they 
could have learned the pattern of 
his living in their first ten days of 
watching. 

Or perhaps they might be wait- 
ing for a clue to what he might 
be doing. And in that direction 
there lay nothing but certain dis- 
appointment. They could watch 



for a thousand years and gain no 
hint of it. 

He turned from the vista and 
went plodding up the road, wor- 
ried and puzzled by the watchers. 

Perhaps, he thought, they had 
not attempted to contact him be- 
cause of certain stories that might 
be told about him. Stories that no 
one, not even Winslowe, would 
pass on to him. What kind of 
stories, he wondered, might the 
neighborhood by now have been 
able to fabricate about him — 
fabulous folk tales to be told in 
bated breath about the chimney 
corner? 

It might be well, he thought, 
that he did not know the stories, 
although it would seem almost a 
certainty that they would exist. 
And it also might be as well that 
the watchers had not attempted 
contact with him. For so long as 
there was no contact, he still was 
fairly safe. So long as there were 
no questions, there need not be 
any answers. 

Are you really, they would ask, 
that same Enoch Wallace who 
marched off in 1861 to fight for 
Old Abe Lincoln? And there was 
one answer to that, there could 
only be one answer. Yes, he’d 
have to say, I am that same man. 

And of all the questions they 
might ask him that would be the 
only one of all he could answer 
truthfully. For all the others there 
would be silence or evasion.

T HEY WOULD ask how come 
that he had not aged — how 
he could stay young when all 
mankind grew old. And he could 
not tell them that he did not age 
inside the station, that he only 
aged when he stepped out of it, 
that he aged an hour each day 
on his daily walks, that he might 
age an hour or so working in his 
garden, that he could age for fif- 
teen minutes sitting on the steps 
to watch a lovely sunset. But 
that when he went back indoors 
again the aging process was com- 
pletely canceled out. 

He could not tell them that. 
And there was much else that he 
could not tell them. There might 
come a time, he knew, if they 
once contacted him, that he’d 
have to flee the questions and cut 
himself entirely from the world, 
remaining isolated within the 
station’s walls. 

Such a course would consti- 
tute no hardship physically, for 
he could live within the station 
without any inconvenience. He 
would want for nothing, for the 
aliens would supply everything 
he needed to remain alive and 
well. He had bought human food 
at times, having Winslowe pur- 
chase it and haul it out from 
town, but only because he felt a 
craving for the food of his own 
planet, in particular those simple 
foods of his childhood and his 
campaigning days. 



But there was one thing the 
aliens could not provide — the 
human contacts he’d maintained 
through Winslowe and the mail. 
Once shut inside the station, he’d 
be cut off completely from the 
world he knew, for the news- 
papers and the magazines were 
his only contact. The operation 
of a radio in the station was made 
impossible by the interference 
set up by the installations. 

He would not know what was 
happening in the world, would 
know no longer how the outside 
might be going. His chart would 
suffer from this and would be- 
come largely useless; although, 
he told himself, it was nearly use- 
less now. 

T>UT ASIDE from all of this, 
he would miss this little out- 
side world that he had grown to 
know so well, this little corner 
of the world encompassed by his 
walks. It was the walks, he 
thought, more than anything, per- 
haps, that had kept him human 
and a citizen of Earth. 

He wondered how important 
it might be that he remain, in- 
tellectually and emotionally, a 
citizen of Earth and a member 
of the human race. Perhaps there 
was no reason that he should. 
With the cosmopolitanism of the 
galaxy at his fingertips, it might 
even be provincial of him to be 
so intent upon continuing identi- 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



47 




fication with the old home planet. 
He might be losing something by 
it. 

But it was not in himself to 
turn his back on Earth. It was a 
place he loved too well — loving 
it even more, most likely, than 
those other humans who had not 
caught his glimpse of far and 
unguessed worlds. A man must 
belong to something, must have 
some loyalty and some identity. 
The galaxy was too big a place 
for any being to stand naked and 
alone. 

A lark sailed out of a grassy 
plot and soared high into the 
sky and seeing it, he waited for 
the trill of liquid song to spray 
out of its throat and drip out of 
the blue. But there was no song, 
as there would have been in 
spring. 



He plodded down the road and 
now, ahead of him, he saw the 
starkness of the station, reared 
upon its ridge. 

Funny, he thought, that he 
should think of it as station rather 
than as home. But it had been a 
station longer than it had been a 
home. 

There was about it a sort of 
ugly solidness, as if it might have 
planted itself upon that ridgetop 
and meant to stay forever. 

It would stay, of course, if one 
wanted it, as long as one wanted 
it. For there was nothing that 
could touch it. 

Even should he be forced some 
day to remain within its walls, 
the station still would stand 
against all of mankind’s watch- 
ing, all of mankind’s prying. They 
could not chip it and they could 
not gouge it and they could not 
break it down. There was nothing 
they could do. All his watching, 
all his speculating, all his ana- 
lyzing, .would gain Man nothing 
beyond the knowledge that a 
highly unusual building existed 
on that ridgetop. For it could sur- 
vive anything except a thermo- 
nuclear explosion — and maybe 
even that. 

He walked into the yard and 
turned around to look back to- 
ward the clump of trees from 
which the flash had come, but 
there was nothing now to indi- 
cate that anyone was there.

VII 

I NSIDE THE station, the mes- 
sage machine was whistling 
plaintively. 

Enoch hung up his gun, drop- 
ped the mail and statuette upon 
his desk and strode across the 
room to the whistling machine. 
He pushed the button and 
punched the lever and the whis- 
tling stopped. 

Upon the message plate he 
read: NO 406,302 TO STATION 
18327. WILL ARRIVE EARLY 
EVENING YOUR TIME. 
HAVE THE COFFEE HOT. 
ULYSSES. 

Enoch grinned. Ulysses and his 
coffee! He was the only one of 
the aliens who had ever liked any 
of Earth’s foods or drinks. There 
had been others who had tried 
them, but not more than once. 

Funny about Ulysses, he 
thought. They had liked each 
other from the very first, from 
that afternoon of the thunder- 
storm when they had been sitting 
on the steps and the mask of 
human form had peeled off the 
alien’s face. 

It had been a grisly face, grace- 
less and repulsive. The face of a 
cruel clown. Enoch wondered, 
even as he thought it, what had 
put that particular phrase into 
his head, for clowns were never 
cruel. But here was one that could 
be — the colored patchwork of 



the face, the hard, tight set of 
jaw, the thin slash of the mouth. 

Then he saw the eyes and they 
canceled all the rest. They were 
large, with softness and a light 
of understanding in them. They 
reached out to him, as another 
being might hold out its hands in 
friendship. 

The rain had come hissing up 
the land to thrum across the ma- 
chine-shed roof and then it was 
upon them, slanting sheets of rain 
that hammered angrily at the 
dust which lay across the yard, 
while chickens ran for cover. 

Enoch sprang to his feet and 
grasped the other’s arm, pulling 
him to the shelter of the porch. 

They stood facing one another, 
and Ulysses had reached up and 
pulled the split and loosened 
mask away. It revealed a bullet 
head without a hair upon it — 
and the painted face. A face like 
a wild and rampaging Indian, 
painted for the warpath, except 
that here and there were touches 
of the clown, as if the entire 
painting job had been meant to 
point up the inconsistent gro- 
tesqueries of war. But even as he 
stared, Enoch knew it was not 
paint, but the natural coloration 
of this thing which had come from 
somewhere among the stars. 

WHATEVER OTHER doubt 
” there was, or whatever won- 
der, Enoch had no doubt at all 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



49 



that this strange being was not 
of the Earth. For it was not 
human. It might be in human 
form, with a pair of arms and 
legs, with a head and face. But 
there was about it an essence 
of inhumanity, almost a nega- 
tion of humanity. 

In olden days, perhaps, it 
might have been a demon. But 
the days were past (although, in 
some areas of the country, not 
entirely past) when one believed 
in demons or in ghosts or in any 
of the other of that ghastly tribe 
which, in man’s imagination, once 
had walked the Earth. 

From the stars, he’d said. And 
perhaps he was. 

Although it made no sense. It 
was nothing one ever had imag- 
ined even in the purest fantasy. 
There was nothing to grab hold 
of, nothing to hang on to. There 
was no yardstick for it and there 
were no rules. It left a sort of 
blank spot in one’s thinking that 
might fill in, with time, but now 
was no more than a tunnel of 
great wonder that went on and 
on forever. 

“Take your time,” the alien 
said. “I know it is not easy. And 
I do not know of a thing that I 
can do to make it easier. There 
is, after all, no way for me to 
prove I am from the stars.” 

“But you talk so well.” 

“In your tongue, you mean. It 
was not too difficult. If you only 



knew of all the languages in the 
galaxy, you would realize how 
little difficult. Your language is 
not hard. It is a basic one. And 
there are many concepts with 
which it need not deal.” 

And, Enoch conceded, that 
could be true enough. 

“If you wish,” the alien said, 
“I can walk off somewhere for 
a day or two. Give you time to 
think. Then I could come back. 
You’d have thought it out by 
then.” 

Enoch smiled woodenly. The 
smile had an unnatural feel upon 
his face. 

“That would give me time,” 
he said, “to spread alarm through- 
out the countryside. There might 
be an ambush waiting for you.” 
The alien shook its head. “I 
am sure you wouldn’t do it. I 
would take the chance if you 
want me to ” 

“No,” said Enoch, so calm he 
surprised himself. “No, when you 
have a thing to face, you face it. 
I learned that in the war.” 

“You’ll do,” the alien said. “You 
will do all right. I did not mis- 
judge you and it makes me 
proud.” 

“Misjudge me?” 

iiVOU DO not think I just 
-*■ came walking in here cold? 
I know about you, Enoch. Almost 
as much as you know about your- 
self. Probably even more.” 



50 



GALAXY 



“You know my name?” 

“Of course I do.” 

“Well, that is fine,” said Enoch. 
“And what about your own?” 

“I am seized with great em- 
barrassment,” the alien told him. 
“For I have no name.” 

Suddenly, for no reason, Enoch 
remembered that slouchy figure 
perching on the top rail of a 
fence, with a stick in one hand 
and a jack knife in the other, 
whittling placidly while the can- 
nonballs whistled overhead and 
less than half a mile away the 
muskets snarled and crackled in 
the billowing powder smoke of 
the line. 

“Then you need a name to call 
you by,” he said, “and it shall 
be Ulysses.” 

“It is agreeable,” said that 
strange one. “But might one ask 
why the name Ulysses?” 

“Because it is the name of a 
great' man of my race.” 

It was a crazy thing. For there 
was no resemblance between the 
two of them — that slouchy 
Union general whittling upon the 
fence and this other who stood 
upon the porch. 

“I am glad you chose it,” said 
this Ulysses, standing on the 
porch. “To my hearing it has a 
dignified and noble sound and, 
between the two of us, I shall be 
glad to bear it. And I shall call 
you Enoch, as friends of the first 
names. For the two of us shall 



work together for many of your 
years.” 

It was beginning to come 
straight now. The thought was 
staggering. Perhaps it was as well 
that Enoch had been so dazed it 
had not come on him all at once. 

“Perhaps,” said Enoch, fighting 
back the realization that was 
crowding in on him, too fast, “I 
could offer you some victuals. I 
could cook up some coffee . .” 

“Coffee,” said Ulysses, smack- 
ing his thin lips. “Do you have 
the coffee?” 

“I’ll make a big pot of it. I’ll 
break in an egg so it will settle 
clear ...” 

“Delectable,” Ulysses said. “Of 
all the drinks that I have drank 
on all the planets I have visited, 
the coffee is the best.” 

THHEY WENT into the kitchen 

and Enoch stirred up the coals 
in the kitchen range and then 
put in new wood. He took the 
coffee pot over to the sink and 
ladeled in some water from the 
water pail and put it on to boil. 
He went into the pantry to get 
some eggs and down into the 
cellar to bring up the ham. 

Ulysses sat stiffly in a kitchen 
chair and watched him as he 
worked. 

“You eat ham and eggs?” 
asked Enoch. 

“I eat anything,” Ulysses said. 
“My race is most adaptable. That 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



51 



is the reason I was sent to this 
planet as a — what do you call 
it? A looker-out, perhaps.” 

“A scout,” suggested Enoch. 

“That is it, a scout.” 

He was an easy thing to talk 
with, Enoch told himself — al- 
most like another person. Al- 
though, God knows, he looked 
little like a person. He looked, 
instead, like some outrageous car- 
icature. 

“You have lived here, in this 
house,” Ulysses said, “for a long, 
long time. You feel affection for 
it.” 

“It has been my home since 
the day that I was born. I was 
gone from it for almost four 
years, but it was always home.” 

Ulysses told him, “I’ll be glad 
to be getting home again myself. 
I’ve been away too long. On a 
mission such as this one, it al- 
ways is too long.” 

Enoch put down the knife he 
had been using to cut a slice of 
ham and sat down heavily in a 
chair. He stared at Ulysses, across 
the table from him. 

“You?” he asked. “You are go- 
ing home?” 

“Why, of course,” Ulysses told 
him. “My job is nearly done. I 
have a home. Did you think I 
hadn’t?” 

“I don’t know,” said Enoch, 
weakly. “I had never thought of 
it.” 

And that was it, he knew. It 



had not occurred to him to con- 
nect a being such as this with a 
thing like home. For it was only 
human beings that had a place 
called home. 

“Some day,” Ulysses said, “I 
shall tell you about my home. 
Some day you may even visit 
me.” 

“Out among the stars,” said 
Enoch. 

“It seems strange to you now,” 
Ulysses said. “It will take a while 
to get used to the idea. But as 
you come to know the whole kit 
and kaboodle of us you will un- 
derstand. I hope you like us. We 
are not bad people, really — not 
any of the many different kinds 
of us.” 

r T'HE STARS, Enoch told him- 
self, were out there in the 
loneliness of space. How far they 
were he could not even guess, 
nor what they were, nor why. 
Another world, he thought. No, 
that was wrong; many other 
worlds. There were people there. 
Perhaps many other people; a 
different kind of people, prob- 
ably, for every different star. And 
one of them sat here in this very 
kitchen, waiting for the coffee 
pot to boil and the ham and 
eggs to fry. 

“But why?” he asked. “But 
why?” 

Ulysses said, “Because we are 
a traveling people. We need a 



52 



GALAXY 



travel station here. We want to 
turn this house into a station and 
you to keep the station.” 

“This house?” 

“We could not build a station, 
for then we’d have people asking 
who was building it and what it 
might be for. So we are forced 
to use an existing structure and 
change it for our needs. But the 
inside only. We leave the outside 
as it is, in appearance. For there 
must be no questions asked.” 
“But traveling ...” 

“From star to star,” Ulysses 
said. “Quicker than the thought 
of it. Faster than a wink. There 
is what you would call machin- 
ery. But it is not machinery — 
not the same as the machinery 
you think of.” 

“You must excuse me,” Enoch 
said, confused. “It seems so im- 
possible.” 

“You remember when the rail- 
road came to Millville?” 

“Yes, I can remember that. I 
was just a kid.” 

“Then think of it this way. 
This is just another railroad. The 
Earth is just another town and 
this house will be the station for 
this new and different railroad. 
The only difference is that no 
one on Earth but you will know 
the railroad’s here. For it will be 
no more than a resting and a 
switching point. No one on the 
Earth can buy a ticket to travel 
on the railroad.” 



Put that way, of course, it had 
a simple sound. But Enoch knew 
it was very far from simple. 

“Railroad cars in space?” he 
asked. 

“Not railroad cars,” Ulysses 
told him. “It is something else. 

I do not know how to begin to 
tell you.” 

“Perhaps you should pick 
someone else. Someone who 
would understand.” 

“There is no one on this planet 
who could understand. We’ll do 
with you as well as anyone.” 

“But ...” 

“What is it, Enoch?” 

“Nothing,” Enoch said. 

For he remembered now how 
he had been sitting on the steps 
thinking how he was alone and 
about a new beginning, knowing 
that he could not escape a new 
beginning, that he must start from 
scratch and build his life anew. 

And here, suddenly, was that 
new beginning — more wondrous 
and fearsome than anything he - 
could have dreamed.

NOCH FILED the message 
and sent his confirmation: 
NO. 406302 RECEIVED. COF- 
FEE ON THE FIRE. ENOCH. 

Clearing the machine, he 
walked over to the No. 3 liquid 
tank he’d prepared before he left. 
He checked the temperature and

the level of the solution and made 
certain once again that the tank 
was securely positioned in re- 
lation to the materializer. 

From there he went to the 
other materializer, the official 
and emergency materializer, over 
in the corner, and checked it over 
closely. It was all right, as usual. 
It always was all right, but be- 
fore each of Ulysses’ visits he 
never failed to check it. There 
was nothing he could have done 
about it had there been some- 
thing wrong, other than send an 
urgent message to Galactic Cen- 
ter. In which case someone would 
have come in on the regular 
materializer and put it iiito shape. 

For the official and emergency 
materializer was exactly what its 
name implied. It was used only 
for official visits by personnel of 
Galactic Center, or for possible 
emergencies. Its operation was 
entirely outside the operation of 
the local station. 

Ulysses, as an inspector for this 
and several other stations, could 
have used the official materializer 
at any time he wished without 
prior notice. But in all the years 
that he had been coming to the 
station he had never failed, 
Enoch remembered with a touch 
of pride, to message he was com- 
ing. Enoch knew that it was a 
courtesy which all the other sta- 
tions on the great galactic net- 
work might not be accorded. 



Tonight, he thought, he prob- 
ably should tell Ulysses about 
the watch that had been put upon 
the station. Perhaps he should 
have told him earlier. But he had 
been reluctant to admit that the 
human race might prove to be a 
problem to the galactic installa- 
tion. 

It was a hopeless thing, he 
thought, this obsession of his to 
present the people of the Earth 
as good and reasonable. For in 
many ways they were neither. 
Perhaps it was because they had 
not as yet entirely grown up. 
They were smart and quick, and 
at times compassionate and even 
understanding, but they failed 
lamentably on many other 
counts. 

But if they had the chance, 
Enoch told himself — if they 
ever got a break, if they only 
could be told what was out in 
space — then they’d get a grip 
upon themselves and they would 
measure up. And then, in the 
course of time, they would be ad- 
mitted into the great confraterni- 
ty of the people of the stars. 

Once admitted, they would 
prove their worth and pull their 
weight. For they were still a 
young race and full of energy — 
at times maybe too much energy. 

Enoch shook his head and went 
across the room to sit down at 
his desk. Drawing the bundle of 
mail in front of him, he slid it 



54 



GALAXY 



out of the string which Winslowe 
had used to tie it all together. 

There were the daily papers, 
a news weekly, two journals — 
Nature and Science — and the 
letter. 

H E PUSHED the papers and 
journals to one side and 
picked up the letter. It was an 
airmail sheet, postmarked Lon- 
don. The return address bore a 
name that was unfamiliar to him. 
He puzzled as to why an un- 
known person should be writing 
him from London. Although any- 
one who wrote him, from London 
or indeed from anywhere, would 
be an unknown person. He knew 
no one in the world outside this 
tiny community. 

He slit the air sheet open and 
spread it out on the desk in front 
of him, pulling the desk lamp 
close so the light would fall upon 
the writing. 

Dear sir, he read, / would sus- 
pect I am unknown to you. I am 
one of the editors of the British 
journal, Nature, to which you 
have been a subscriber for these 
many years. I do not use the jour- 
nal’s letterhead because this let- 
ter is personal and unofficial — 
and perhaps not even in the best 
of taste. 

You are, it may interest you 
to know, our eldest subscriber. 
We have had you on our mailing 
lists for more than eighty years. 



While I am aware that it is 
no concern of mine, I have won- 
dered if you, yourself, have sub- 
scribed to our publication for 
this length of time, or if it might 
be possible that your father or 
someone close to you may have 
been the original subscriber and 
you simply have allowed the sub- 
scription to continue in his name. 

My interest undoubtedly con- 
stitutes an unwarranted and in- 
excusable curiosity and if you, 
sir, choose to ignore the query it 
is entirely within your rights and 
proper that you do so. But if you 
should not mind replying, an an- 
swer would be appreciated. 

I can only say in my own de- 
fense that I have been associated 
for so long with our publication 
that I feel a certain sense of pride 
that someone has found it worth 
the having for more than eighty 
years. I doubt that many publi- 
cations can boast such long time 
interest on the part of any man. 

May l assure you, sir, of my ut- 
most respect. 

Sincerely yours. 

And then the signature. 

P<NOCH SHOVED the letter 
from him. 

There it was again, he told 
himself. Here was another watch- 
er, although a discreet and most 
polite one, unlikely to cause trou- 
ble. 

But someone else had taken 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



55 



notice, had felt a twinge of won- 
der at the same man subscribing 
to a magazine for more than 
eighty years. 

As the years went on, there 
would be more and more. 

It was not only the watchers 
encamped outside the station 
with whom he must concern him- 
self, but those potential others. 
A man could be as self-effacing 
as he could manage and still he 
could not hide. Soon or late, the 
world would catch up with him 
and would come crowding around 
his door, agog to know why he 
might be hiding. 

It was useless to hope for much 
further time. The world was 
closing in. 

Why can’t they leave me alone, 
he thought. If he only could ex- 
plain how the situation stood, 
they might leave him alone. 

But he couldn’t explain. And 
even if he could, there would be 
some of them who’d still come 
crowding in. 

Across the room the material- 
izer beeped for attention and 
Enoch swung around. 

The Thuban had arrived. He 
was in the tank, a shadowy, glob- 
ular blob of substance. Above 
him, riding sluggishly in the solu- 
tion, was a cube of something. 

Luggage, Enoch wondered. But 
the message had said there would 
be no luggage. 

Even as he hurried across the 



room, the clicking came to him. 
The Thuban was talking to him. 

Presentation to you, said the 
clicking. Deceased fibrous vege- 
tation. 

Enoch peered at the cube float- 
ing in the liquid. 

Take him, clicked the Thuban. 
Bring him for you. 

Fumblingly Enoch clicked out 
his answer, using tapping fingers 
against the glass side of the tank: 

/ thank you, gracious one. He 
wondered as he did it if he were 
using the proper form of address 
to this blob of matter. A man 
could get terribly tangled up on 
that particular point of etiquette. 
There were some of these beings 
that one addressed in flowery 
language (and even in those 
cases, the floweriness would vary) 
and others that one talked with 
in the simplest, bluntest, most 
forthright terms. 

He reached into the tank and 
lifted out the cube. It was a block 
of heavy wood, black as ebony 
and so close-grained it looked 
very much like stone. He chuck- 
led inwardly, thinking how, in 
listening to Winslowe, he had 
grown to be an expert in the 
judging of artistic wood. 

He put the wood upon the floor 
and turned back to the tank. 

Would you mind, clicked the 
Thuban, revealing what you do 
with him? To us, very useless 
stuff. 



56 



GALAXY 



E NOCH HESITATED, search- 
ing desperately through his 
memory. What, he wondered, was 
the code for “carve?” 

Well? the Thuban asked. 

You must pardon me, gracious 
one. I do not use this language 
often. I am not proficient. 

Drop, please, the gracious one. 
/ am a common being. 

Shape it, Enoch tapped. Into 
another form. Are you a visual 
being? Then I show you one. 

Not visual, said the Thuban. 
Many other things, not visual. 

It had been a globe when it 
had arrived and now it was be- 
ginning to flatten out. 

You, the Thuban clicked, are a 
biped being. 

That is what I am. 

Your planet, It is a solid plan- 
et? 

Solid? Enoch wondered. Oh, 
yes, solid as opposed to liquid. 

One quarter solid, he tapped. 
The rest of it is liquid. 

Mine almost all liquid. Only 
little solid. Very restful world. 

One thing I want to ask you, 
Enoch tapped. 

Ask, the creature said. 

You are a mathematician. All 
you folks, I mean. 

Yes, the creature said. Excel- 
lent recreation. Occupies the 
mind. 

You mean you do not use it? 
Oh, yes, once use it. But no 
need for use any more. Got all we 



need to use, very long ago. Recre- 
ation now. 

I have heard of your system of 
numerical notation. 

Very different, clicked the 
Thuban. Very better concept. 

You can tell me of it? 

You know notation system 
used by people of Polaris VII? 

No, I don’t, tapped Enoch. 

Then no. use to tell you of our 
own. Must know Polaris first. 

So that was that, thought 
Enoch. He might have known. 
There was so much knowledge in 
the galaxy and he knew so little 
of it, understood so little of the 
little that he knew. 

There were men on Earth who 
could make sense of it. Men who 
would give anything short of 
their very lives to know the little 
that he knew, and could put it 
all to use. 

Out among the stars lay a mas- 
sive body of wisdom, some of it 
an extension of what mankind 
knew, some of it concerning mat- 
ters which Man had not yet sus- 
pected, and used in ways and for 
purposes that Man has not as yet 
imagined. And never might imag- 
ine, if left on his own. 

Another hundred years, thought 
Enoch. How much would he 
learn in another hundred years? 
In another thousand? Would he 
learn enough? 

I rest now, said the Thuban. 
Nice to talk with you.

for that matter — could use at 
data upon which to base his 
premises. And human science had 
so far found nothing to suggest a 
faster speed than light. 

But the impulse patterns which 
carried creatures from star to 
star were almost instantaneous, 
no matter what the distance. 

It was hard to believe. Mo- 
ments ago the creature in the 
tank had rested in another tank 
in another station. The material- 
izer had built up a pattern of it 
— not only of its body, but of 
its very vital force, the thing that 
gave it life. Then the impulse pat- 
tern had moved across the gulfs 
of space almost instantaneously 
to the receiver of this station, 



where the pattern had been used 
to duplicate the body and the 
mind and memory and the life 
of that creature now lying dead 
many light years distant. And in 
the tank the new body and the 
new mind and memory and life 
had taken almost instant form. 
An entirely new being; but exact- 
ly like the old one, so that the 
identity continued and the con- 
sciousness (the very thought no 
more than momentarily inter- 
rupted), so that to all intent and 
purpose the being was the same. 

rpHERE WERE limitations to

had nothing to do with speed. 
The impulses could cross the en-

tank and picked up the block 
of wood. A little puddle of liquid 
had drained off it and lay glisten- 
ing on the floor. 

He carried the block across the 
room to one of the windows and 
examined it. At one corner of it 
a bit of bark remained. It had 
been sawed; someone had cut it 
into a size that would fit the tank 
where the Thuban rested. 

He recalled an article he had 
read in one of the daily papers 
just a day or two before in which 
a scientist had contended that no 
great intelligence ever could de- 
velop on a liquid world. 



But that scientist was wrong, 
for the Thuban race had so de- 
veloped. There were other liquid 
worlds which were members of 
the galactic confraternity. There 
were a lot of things that Man 
would have to unlearn, as well as 
learn, if he ever should become 
aware of the galactic culture. 

The limitation of the speed of 
light, for one thing. 

For if nothing moved faster 
than the speed of light, then the 
galactic transport system would 
be impossible. 

But one should not censure 
Man, he reminded himself, for 
setting the speed of light as a 
basic limitation. Observations 
were all that Man — or anyone,

tire galaxy with but little lag in 
time. But under certain condi- 
tions the patterns tended to break 
down. This was why there must 
be many stations — many thou- 
sands of them. Clouds of dust or 
gas or areas of high ionization 
seemed to disrupt the patterns. 
In the sectors of the galaxy where 
these conditions were encoun- 
tered, the distance jumps between 
the stations were considerably 
cut down to keep the pattern 
true. There were areas that had 
to be detoured because of high 
concentrations of the distorting 
gas and dust. 

Enoch wondered how many 
dead bodies of the creature that 
now rested in the tank had been 
left behind at other stations in 
the course of the journey it was 
making — as this body in a few 
hours’ time would lie dead within 
this tank when the creature’s pat- 
tern was sent out again, riding on 
the impulse waves. 

A long trail of dead, left across 
the stars. Each to be destroyed 
by a wash of acid and flushed into 
deep-lying tanks, but with the 
creature itself going on and on 
until it reached its final destina- 
tion, to carry out the purpose of 
its journey. 

And those purposes, Enoch 
wondered — the many purposes 
of the many creatures who passed 
through the stations scattered 
wide in space? There had been 



certain instances when, chatting 
with the travelers, they had told 
their purpose. But with most of 
them he never learned the pur- 
pose. Nor had he any right to 
learn it. For he was the keeper 
only. 

Mine host, he thought. Al- 
though not every time, for there 
were many creatures that had no 
use for hosts. But the man, at any 
rate, who watched over the oper- 
ation of the station and who kept 
it going, who made ready for the 
travelers and who sent them on 
their way again when that time 
should come. And who performed 
the little tasks and courtesies of 
which they might stand in need. 

He looked at the block of wood 
and thought how pleased Wins- 
lowe would be with it. It was 
very seldom that one came upon 
wood as black or fine-grained as 
this. 

What would Winslowe think, 
he wondered, if he could only 
know that the statuettes he 
carved were made of woods 
that had grown on unknown plan- 
ets many light-years distant? 
Winslowe must have wondered 
many times where the wood came 
from. But he had never asked. 
And he knew as well, of course, 
that there was something very 
strange about this man who came 
out to the mail box every day to 
- meet him. But he had never 
asked that, either. 



60 



GALAXY 



That was what he meant by 

friendship. 

T HIS WOOD that he held in 
his hands was another evi- 
dence of friendship — the friend- 
ship of the stars for a very 
humble keeper of a remote and 
backwoods station stuck out in 
one of the spiral arms, far from 
the center of the galaxy. 

The word had spread, appar- 
ently, through the years and 
throughout space, that this certain 
keeper was a collector of exotic 
woods. And so the woods came 
in. Not only from those races he 
thought of as his friends, but from 
total strangers, like the blob that 
now rested in the tank. 

He put the wood down on a 
table top and went to the refriger- 
ator. From it he took a slab of 
aged cheese that Winslowe had 
bought for him several days ago, 
and a small package of fruit that 
a traveler from Sirrah X had 
brought the day before. 

“Analyzed,” it had told him, 
“and you can eat it without hurt. 
It will play no trouble with your 
metabolism. You’ve had it before, 
perhaps? So you haven’t. I am 
sorry. It is most delicious. Next 
time, you like it, I shall bring 
you more.” 

From the cupboard beside the 
refrigerator he took out a small, 
flat loaf of bread, part of the ra- 
tion regularly provided him by 



Galactic Central. Made of a 
cereal unlike any known on 
Earth, it had a nutty flavor with 
the hint of some alien spice. 

He put the food on what he 
called the kitchen table, although 
there was no kitchen. Then he 
put the coffee maker on the stove 
and went back to his desk. 

The letter still laid there, 
spread out. He folded it together 
and put it in a drawer. 

He stripped the brown folders 
off the papers and put them in a 
pile. From the pile he selected 
The New York Times and moved 
to his favorite chair to read. 

NEW PEACE CONFERENCE 
AGREED UPON, said the lead- 
off headline. 

The crisis had been boiling for 
a month or more, the newest of 
a long series of crises which had 
kept the world on edge for years. 
The worst of it was that the most 
of them were manufactured cri- 
ses. One side or the other was 
merely pushing for advantage in 
the relentless chess game of 
power politics which had been 
underway since the end of World 
War II. 

The stories in The Times bear- 
ing on the conference had a 
rather desperate, almost fatalis- 
tic, ring, as if the writers of the 
stories, and perhaps the diplo- 
mats and all the rest involved, 
knew the conference would ac- 
complish nothing — if, in fact, it 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



61 



did not serve to make the crisis 
deeper. 

Observers in this capital, wrote 
on of The Times’ Washington bu- 
reau staff, are not convinced the 
conference will serve, in this in- 
stance, as similar conferences 
sometimes have served in the 
past, either to delay a showdown 
on the issues or to advance the 
prospects for a settlement. There 
is scarcely concealed concern in 
many quarters that the confer- 
ence will, instead, fan the flames 
of controversy higher without, by 
way of compensation, opening 
any avenues by which a com- 
promise might seem possible. A 
conference is popularly supposed 
to provide a time and place for 
the sober weighing of the facts 
and points of argument. But there 
are few who see in the calling 
of this conference any indications 
that this may be the case. 

The coffee maker was going 
full blast now. Enoch threw the 
paper down and strode to the 
stove to snatch it off. From the 
cupboard he got a cup and went 
to the table with it. 

But before he began to eat, he 
went back to the desk and, open- 
ing a drawer, got out his chart 
and spread it on the table. Once 
again he wondered just how valid 
it might be. In certain parts of it, 
at times, it seemed to make a 
certain sort of sense. 

He had based it on the Mizar 



theory of statistics and had been 
forced, because of the nature of 
his subject, to shift some of the 
factors, to substitute some values. 
He wondered now, for the thou- 
sandth time, if he had made an 
error somewhere. Had his shifting 
and substitution destroyed the 
validity of the system? And if 
so, how could he correct the er- 
rors to restore validity? 

Here the factors were, he 
thought: the birth rate and the 
total population of the Earth, 
the death rate, the values of cur- 
rencies, the spread of living costs, 
attendance of places of worship, 
medical advances, technological 
developments, industrial indices, 
the labor market, world trade 
trends — and many others, in- 
cluding some that at first glance 
might not seem too relevant: the 
auction price of art objects, vaca- 
tion preferences and movements, 
the speed of transportation, the 
incidence of insanity. 

The statistical method devel- 
oped by the mathematicians of 
Mizar, he knew, would work any- 
where, on anything, if applied 
correctly. But he had been forced 
°to twist it in translating an alien 
planet’s situation to fit the situa- 
tion here on Earth. And in conse- 
quence of that twisting, did it 
still apply? 

He shuddered as he looked at 
it. For if he’d made no mistake, 
if he’d handled everything cor- 



<52 



GALAXY 



rectly, if his translations had done 
n o violence to the concept, then 
the Earth was headed straight for 
another major war. 

H E LET go the corners of 
the chart. It rolled itself back 
into a cylinder. 

He reached for one of the fruits 
the Sirrah being had brought him 
and bit into it. He rolled it on 
his tongue, savoring the delicacy 
of the taste. It was as good as 
that strange, bird-like being had 
guaranteed it would be. 

There had been a time, he re- 
membered, when he had held 
some hope that the chart based 
on the Mizar theory might show, 
if not a way to end all war, at 
least a way to keep the peace. 
But the chart had never given 
any hint of the road to peace. 
Inexorably, relentlessly, it had led 
the way to war. 

How many other wars, he won- 
dered, could the people of the 
Earth endure? 

No man could say, of course. 
But it might be just one more. 
For the weapons that would be 
used in the coming conflict had 
not as yet been measured. There 
was no man who could come close 
to actually estimating the results 
these weapons would produce. 

War had been bad enough 
when men faced one another with 
their weapons in their hands, but 
in any present war great payloads 



of destruction would go hurtling 
through the skies to engulf whole 
cities — aimed not at military 
concentrations, but at total popu- 
lations. 

He reached out his hand for 
the chart again, then pulled it 
back. There was no further need 
of looking at it. He knew it all 
by heart. There was no hope in 
it. He might study it and puzzle 
over it until the crack of doom 
and it would not change a whit. 
There was no hope at all. The 
world was thundering once again, 
in a blind red haze of fury and 
of helplessness, down the road to 
war. 

He went on with his eating 
and the fruit was even better 
than it had been at first bite. 
Next time, the being had said, I 
will bring you more. But it might 
be a long time before he came 
again, and he might never come. 
There were many of them who 
passed through only once, al- 
though there were a few who 
showed up every week or so — 
old, regular travelers who had be- 
come close friends. 

And there had been, he re- 
called, that little group of Hazers 
who, years ago, had made ar- 
rangements for extra long stop- 
overs at the station so they could 
sit around this very table and 
talk the hours away, arriving 
laden with hampers and with 
baskets of things to eat and drink, 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



63 



as if it were a picnic they had 
stopped for. 

But finally they had stopped 
their coming. It had been years 
since he’d seen any one of them. 
He regretted it, for they’d been 
the best of companions. 

He drank an extra cup of cof- 
fee, sitting idly in the chair, think- 
ing about those good old days 
when the band of Hazers came. 

X 

TTIS EARS caught the faint 
rustling and he glanced 
quickly up to see her sitting on 
the sofa, dressed in the demure 
hoop skirts of the 1860 s. 

“Mary!” he cried, surprised, 
rising to his feet. 

She was smiling at him in her 
very special way and she was 
beautiful, he thought, as no other 
woman ever had been beautiful. 

“Mary,” he said, “it’s so nice 
to have you here.” 

And now, leaning on the man- 
tlepiece, dressed in Union blue, 
with his belted sabre and his full 
black mustache, was another of 
his friends. 

“Hello, Enoch,” David Ran- 
some said. “I hope we don’t in- 
trude.” 

“Never,” Enoch told him. “How 
can two friends intrude?” 

He stood beside the table and 
the past was with him, the good 
and restful past, the rose-scented 



and unhaunted past that had 
never left him. 

Somewhere in the distance was 
the sound of fife and drum and 
the jangle of the battle harness 
as the boys marched off to war, 
with the colonel glorious in his 
full dress uniform upon the great 
black stallion, and the regimental 
flags snapping in the stiff June 
breeze. 

He walked across the room and 
over to the sofa. He made a little 
bow to Mary. 

“With your permission, ma’am,” 
he said. 

“Please do,” she said. “If you 
should happen to be busy we 
would understand . .” 

“Not at all,” he said. “I was 
hoping you would come.” 

He sat down on the sofa, not 
too close to her. Her hands were 
folded very primly in her lap. He 
wanted to reach out and take her 
hands in his and hold them for 
a moment, but he knew he 
couldn’t. 

For she wasn’t really there. 

UTT’S BEEN almost a week,” 
said Mary, “since I’ve seen 
you. How is your work going, 
Enoch?” 

He shook his head. “I still have 
all the problems. The watchers 
still are out there. And the chart 
says war.” 

David left the mantle and 
came across the room. He sat 



64 



GALAXY 



down in a chair and arranged his 
sabre. 

“War, the way they fight it 
these days,” he declared, “would 
be a sorry business. Not the way 
we fought it, Enoch.” 

“No,” said Enoch. “Not the way 
we fought it. A war would be bad 
enough, but there is something 
worse. If Earth fights another war, 
our people will be barred for 
many centuries from the con- 
fraternity of space.” 

“Maybe that’s not so bad,” said 
David. “We may not be ready to 
join the ones in space.” 

“Perhaps not,” Enoch admit- 
ted. “I rather doubt we are. But 
we could be some day. And that 
day would be shoved far into the 
future if we fight another war. 
You have to make some pretense 
of being civilized to join those 
other races.” 

“Maybe,” Mary said, “they 
might never know. About a war, 
I mean. They go no place but 
this station.” 

Enoch shook his head. “They 
would know. I think they're 
watching us. Anyhow, they would 
read the papers.” 

“The papers you subscribe to?” 
“I save them for Ulysses. That 
pile over in the corner. He takes 
them back to Galactic Central 
every time he comes. He’s very 
interested in Earth, you know, 
from the years he spent here. And 
from Galactic Central, once he’s 



read them, I have a hunch the 
papers travel to the corners of 
the galaxy.” 

“Can you imagine,” David 
asked, “what the promotion de- 
partments of those newspapers 
might have to say about it if they 
only knew their depth of circula- 
tion?” 

Enoch grinned at the thought. 

“There’s that paper down in 
Georgia,” David said, “that covers 
Dixie like the dew. They’d have 
to think of something that goes 
with galaxy.” 

“Glove,” said Mary, quickly. 
“Covers the galaxy like a glove. 
What do you think of that?” 

“Excellent,” said David. 

UpOOR ENOCH,” Mary said, 
contrite. “Here we make 
our jokes and Enoch has his prob- 
lems.” 

“Not mine to solve, of course,” 
Enoch told her. “I’m just worried 
by them. All I have to do is stay 
inside the station and there are 
no problems. Once you close the 
door here, the problems of the 
world are securely locked out- 
side.” 

“But you can’t do that.” 

“No, I can’t,” said Enoch. 

“I think you may be right,” 
said David, “in thinking that 
these other races may be watch- 
ing us. With an eye, perhaps, to 
some day inviting the human race 
to join them. Otherwise, why 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



65 



would they have wanted to set 
up a station here on Earth?” 
“They’re expanding the net- 
work all the time,” said Enoch. 
“They needed a station in this 
solar system to carry out their 
extension into this spiral arm.” 
“Yes, that’s true enough,” said 
David, “but it need not have been 
the Earth. They could have built 
a station out on Mars and used 
an alien for a keeper and still 
have served their purpose.” 

“I’ve often thought of that,” said 
Mary. “They wanted a station 
on the Earth and an Earthman 
as its keeper. There must be a 
reason for it.” 

“I had hoped there was,” Enoch 
told her. “But I’m afraid they 
came too soon. It’s too early for 
the human race. We aren’t grown 
up. We still are juveniles.” 

“It’s a shame,” said Mary. 
“We’d have so much to learn. 
They know so much more than 
we. Their concept of religion, for 
example.” 

“I don’t know,” said Enoch, 
“whether it’s actually a religion. 
It seems to have few of the trap- 
pings we associate with religion. 
And it is not based on faith. It 
doesn’t have to be. It is based on 
knowledge. These people know, 
you see.” 

“But don’t you think,” asked 
David, “that the human race may 
sense this? They don’t know it, 
but they sense it. And are reach- 



ing out to touch it. They haven’t 
got the knowledge, so they must 
do the best they can with faith. 
And that faith goes back a far 
way, perhaps deep into the pre- 
historic days.” 

“I suppose so,” Enoch said. 
“But it actually wasn’t the spiri- 
tual force I was thinking of. 
There are all the other things, 
the material things, the methods, 
the philosophies that the human 
race could use. Name almost any 
branch of science and there is 
something there for us — more 
than what we have.” 

But his mind went back to 
that strange business of the spirit- 
ual force and the even stranger 
machine which had been built 
eons ago, by means of which the 
galactic people were able to 
establish contact with the force. 
There was a name for that ma- 
chine, but there was no word in 
the English language which close- 
ly approximated it. 

Talisman was the closest. But 
Talisman was too crude a word 
— although that had been the 
word that Ulysses had used when, 
some years ago, they had talked 
of it. 

HPHERE WERE so many 
-*• things, so many concepts, he 
thought, out in the galaxy which 
could not be adequately ex- 
pressed in any tongue on Earth. 
The Talisman was more than a 



66 



GALAXY 



talisman and the machine which 
had been given the name was 
more than a mere machine. In- 
volved in it, as well as certain 
mechanical concepts, was a psy- 
chic concept, perhaps some sort 
of psychic energy that was un- 
known on Earth. That and a 
great deal more. He had read 
some of the literature on the spir- 
itual force and on the Talisman 
and had realized, he remembered, 
in the reading of it, how far short 
he fell • — how far short the 
human race must fall — in an 
understanding of it. 

The Talisman could be oper- 
ated only by certain beings with 
certain types of minds and some- 
thing else besides (could it be, 
he wondered, with certain kinds 
of souls?) Sensitives was the 
word he had used in his mental 
translation of the term for these 
kinds of people. But once again 
he could not be sure if the word 
came close to fitting. The Talis- 
man was placed in the custody 
of the most capable, or the most 
efficient, or the most devoted 
(whichever it might be) of the 
galactic sensitives, who carried it 
from star to star in a sort of eter- 
nal progression. And on each 
planet the people came to make 
personal and individual contact 
with the spiritual force through 
the intervention and the agency 
of the Talisman and its custo- 
dian. 



He found that he was shivering 
at the thought of it — the pure 
ecstasy of reaching out and touch- 
ing the spirituality that flooded 
through the galaxy and, undoubt- 
edly, through the universe. The 
assurance would be there that life 
had a special place in the great 
scheme of existence — that one, 
no matter how small, how feeble, 
how insignificant, still did count 
for something in the vast sweep 
of space and time. 

“What is the trouble, Enoch?” 
Mary asked. 

“Nothing,” he said. 

David said, “You were talking 
about what we could find in the 
galaxy. There was, for one thing, 
that strange sort of math. You 
were telling us of it once — ” 
“The Arcturus math, you 
mean,” said Enoch. “I know little 
more than when I told you of it. 
It is too involved. It is based on 
behavior symbolism.” 

There was some doubt, he told 
himself, that you could even call 
it math. It was something that 
the scientists of Earth, no doubt, 
could use to make possible the 
engineering of the social sciences 
as logically and as efficiently as 
the common brand of math had 
been used to build the gadgets 
of the Earth. 

“And the biology of that race 
out in Andromeda,” Mary said. 
“The ones who colonized all those 
crazy planets.” 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



67 



“Yes, I know. But Earth would 
have to mature a bit in its intel- 
lectual and emotional outlook be- 
fore we’d venture to use it as 
the Andromedans did. Still, I sup- 
pose that it would have its appli- 
cations.” 

TTE SHUDDERED inwardly 
as he thought of how the 
Andromedans used it. And that, 
he knew, was proof that he still 
was a man of Earth, kin to all 
the bias and the prejudice and 
the shibboleths of the human 
mind. For what the Andromedans 
had done was only common 
sense. If you cannot colonize a 
planet in your present shape, 
why, then you change your 
shape. You make yourself into 
the sort of being that can live 
upon the planet and then you 
take it over in that alien shape 
into which you have changed 
yourself. If you need to be a 
worm, then you become a worm. 
Or an insect. Or a shellfish, or 
whatever it may take. And you 
change not your body only, but 
your mind as well, into the kind 
of mind that will be necessary to 
live upon that planet. 

“There are all the drugs,” said 
Mary, “and the medicines. The 
medical knowledge that could ap- 
ply to Earth. There was that lit- 
tle package Galactic Central sent 
you.” 

“A packet of drugs,” said 



Enoch, “that could cure almost 
every ill on Earth. That, perhaps, 
hurts me most of all. To know 
they’re up there in the cupboard, 
actually on this planet, where so 
many people need them.” 

“You could mail out samples,” 
David said, “to medical associa- 
tions or to some drug concern.” 

Enoch shook his head. “I 
thought of that, but I have the 
galaxy to consider. I have an 
obligation to Galactic Central. 
They have taken great precau- 
tions that the station not be 
known. I cannot wreck their 
plans. For when you think of it, 
Galactic Central and the work 
it’s doing is more important than 
the Earth.” 

“Divided loyalties,” said David, 
with slight mockery in his tone. 

“That is it, exactly. There had 
been a time, many years ago, 
when I thought of writing papers 
for some of the scientific journals. 
Not the medical journals, natu- 
rally, for I know nothing about 
medicine. The drugs are there, 
of course, lying on the shelf, with 
directions for their use, but they 
are merely so many pills or pow- 
ders or ointments, or whatever 
they may be. But there were 
other things I’d learned. Not too 
much about them, naturally, but 
at least some hints in some new 
directions. Enough that someone 
could pick them up and go on 
from there. Someone who might 



68 



GALAXY 



know what to do with them.” 

“But,, look here,” David said, 
“that wouldn’t have worked out. 
You have no technical nor re- 
search background, no education- 
al record. You’re not tied up with 
any school or college. The jour- 
nals just don’t publish you unless 
you can prove yourself.” 

66T REALIZE that, of course, 
That’s why I never wrote 
the papers. I knew there was no 
use. You can’t blame the jour- 
nals. They must be responsible. 
Their pages aren’t open to just 
anyone. And even if they had 
viewed the papers with enough 
respect to want to publish them, 
they would have had to find out 
who I was. And that would have 
led straight back to the station.” 

“Even so,” said David, “there’d 
be little you actually could tell 
them. What I mean is that gen- 
erally you haven’t got enough to 
go on. So much of this galactic 
knowledge is off the beaten 
track.” 

“I know,” said Enoch. “The 
mental engineering of Manka- 
linen III, for one thing. If the 
Earth could know of that, our 
people undoubtedly could find a 
clue to the treatment of the 
neurotic and the mentally dis- 
turbed. We could empty all the 
institutions and we could tear 
them down or use them for some- 
thing else. There’d be no need of 



them. But no one other than the 
people out on Mankalinen III 
could ever tell us of it. I only 
know they are noted for their 
mental engineering, but that is 
all I know. I haven’t the faintest 
inkling of what it’s all about. It’s 
something that you’d have to get 
from the people out there.” 

“What you are really talking 
of,” said Mary, “are all the name- 
less sciences — the ones that no 
human has ever thought about.” 

“Like us, perhaps,” said David. 

“David!” Mary cried. 

“There js no sense,” said 
David, angrily, “in pretending we 
are people.” 

“But you are,” said Enoch 
tensely. “You are people to me. 
You are the only people that I 
have. What is the matter, 
David? 

“I think,” said David, “that the 
time has come to say what we 
really are. We are illusion. We 
are created and called up. We 
exist only for one purpose, to 
come and talk with you, to fill 
in for the real people that you 
cannot have.” 

“Mary,” Enoch cried, “you 
don’t think that way, too! You 
can’t think that way!” 

He reached out his arms to her 
and then he let them drop — 
terrified at the realization of what 
he’d been about to do. It was the 
first time he’d ever tried to touch 
her. 



HERE GATHER THE STARS 



69 



It was the first time, in all the 
years, that he had forgotten. 

46T am sorry, Mary. I should 
not have done that.” 

Her eyes were bright with 
tears. 

“I wish you could,” she said. 
“Oh, how I wish you could!” 

“David,” he said, not turning 
his head. 

“David left,” said Mary. 

“He won’t be back,” said 
Enoch. 

Mary shook her head. 

“What is the matter, Mary? 
What is it all about? What have 
I done!” 

“Nothing,” Mary said, “except 
that you made us too much like 
people. So that we became more 
human, until we were entirely 
human. No longer puppets, no 
longer pretty dolls, but really 
actual people. I think David must 
resent it — not that he is people, 
but that being people, he is still 
a shadow. It did not matter when 
we were dolls or puppets, for we 
were not human then. We had 
no human feelings.” 

“Mary, please,” he said. “Mary, 
please forgive me.” 

She leaned toward him and 
her face was lighted by deep 
tenderness. “There is nothing to 
forgive,” she said. “Rather, I sup- 
pose, we should thank you for it. 
You created us out of a love of 
us and a need of us and it is won- 



derful to know that you are 
loved and needed.” 

“But I don’t create you any 
more,” Enoch pleaded. “There 
was a time, long ago, I had to. 
But not any longer. Now you 
come to visit me of your own 
free will.” 

How many years, he wondered. 
It must be all of fifty. And Mary 
had been the first, and David 
had been second. Of all the others 
of them, they had been the first 
and were the closest and the 
dearest. 

And before that, before he’d 
even tried, he’d spent other years 
in studying that nameless science 
stemming from the thaumatur- 
gists of Alphard XXII. 

There had been a day and a 
state of mind when it would have 
been black magic, but it was not 
black magic. Rather, it was the 
orderly manipulation of certain 
natural aspects of the universe as 
yet quite unsuspected by the hu- 
man race. Perhaps aspects that 
Man never would discover. For 
there was not, at least at the pres- 
ent moment, the necessary orien- 
tation of the scientific mind. 

“David felt,” said Mary, “that 
we could not go on forever, play- 
ing out our little sedate visits. 
There had to be a time when we 
faced up to what we really are.” 
“And the rest of them?” 

“I am sorry, Enoch. The rest 
of them as well.”

“But you? How about you, 
Mary?” 

“I don’t know,” she said. “It is 
different with me. I love you very 
much.” 

“And I . ” 

“No, that’s not what I mean. 
Don’t you understand? I’m in 
love with you.” 

H E SAT stricken, staring at 
her. There was a great roar- 
ing in the world, as if he were 
standing still and the world and 
time were rushing swiftly past 
him. 

“If it only could have stayed,” 
she said, “the way it was at first. 
Then we were glad of our exist- 
ence. Our emotions were so shal- 
low; we seemed to be so happy. 
Like little children, running in 
the sun. But then we all grew up. 
And I think I the most of all.” 

She smiled at him and tears 
were in her eyes. 

“Don’t take it so hard, Enoch. 
We can . ” 

“My dear,” he said, “I’ve been 
in love with you since the first 
day that I saw you. I think, may- 
be, even before that.” 

He reached out a hand to her, 
then pulled it back, remembering. 

“I did not know,” she said. “I 
should not have told you. You 
could live with it until you knew 
I loved you, too.” 



He nodded, dumbly. 

She bowed her head. “Dear 
God, we don’t deserve this. We 
have done nothing to deserve it.” 

She raised her head and looked 
at him. “If I could only touch 
you.” 

“We can go on,” he said, “as 
we have always done. You can 
come to see me any time you 
want. We can . ” 

She shook her head. “It 
wouldn’t work,” she said. “Neither 
of us could stand it.” 

He knew that she was right. He 
knew that it was done. For fifty 
years she and the others had been 
dropping in to visit. And they’d 
come no more. For the fairyland 
was shattered and the magic spell 
was broken. He’d be left alone 
— more alone than ever, more 
alone than before he’d ever known 
her. 

She would not come again and 
he could never bring himself to 
call her up again, even if he 
could. And his shadow world and 
his shadow love, the only love 
he’d ever really had, would be 
gone forever. 

“Good-by, my dear,” he said. 

But it was too late. She was 
already gone. 

And from far off, it seemed, he 
heard the moaning whistle that 
said a message had come in.

661VTOTHING, nothing to get 
■*- ’ upset about,” Pashkov said 
soothingly, taking his friend’s 
arm as they came out of the villa 
forty miles from Moscow. Pash- 
kov looked like a roly-poly zoo 
attendant leading a tame bear. 
“Erase his memory, give him a 
new name and feed him more 
patriotism. Very simple.” 

Medvedev raised his hand 
threateningly. “Don’t come howl- 
ing to me if everybody guesses 
he is nothing but a robot.” 

Pashkov glanced back at the 
house. Since the publication of 
Dentist Amigovitch, this house 
had become known all over the 
world as Boris Knackenpast’s 
villa. Now the house was guarded 



by a company of soldiers to keep 
visitors out. From an open win- 
dow Pashkov heard the clicking 
of a typewriter. 

“It’s when they’re not like ro- 
bots that everybody suspects 
them,” he said, climbing into his 
flier. “Petchareff will send you 
word when to announce his 
‘death’.” 

“A question, brother.” 

“No questions.” 

“Who smuggled the manuscript 
out of Russia?” 

Pashkov frowned convincingly. 
“Comrade Petchareff has sus- 
pected even me.” 

He took off for Moscow, pok- 
ing his flier up through the clouds 
and flying close to them, as was

his habit. Then he switched on 
the radio and got Petchareff’s 
secretary. “Nadezhda?” 

“I know what you’re up to, 
Seven One Three,” Nadezhda 
Brunhildova said. “Don’t try to 
fool me, you confidence man. 
You are coming in?” 

“In ten minutes. What have I 
done now?” 

“You were supposed to make 
funeral arrangements for Knack- 
enpast, so what are you doing in 
Stockholm?” 

“Stockholm?” 

“You’re lying and I’ll kill you. 
Don’t you think I know about 
Anastina, that she-nurse in the 
Stockholm National Hospital?” 
“Darling, why so cruel? Anas- 
tina is one of our contacts. Be- 
sides, she’s cross-eyed and buck- 
toothed.” 

“Beast!” She switched him to 
Petchareff. 

“What’s been keeping you, 
Pashkov?” 

“Consoling Medvedev. Am I 
supposed to be in Stockholm?” 
“Never mind, get here at once. 
What size hospital gown do you 
wear?” 

“Hospital gown?” 

“Stockholm embassy says 
you’re in the National Hospital 
there. In a hospital gown. I got 
through to Anastina. She says it’s 
Colonel James again. He looks 
like you now.” 

Pashkov grunted. 



“I’ll never understand,” said 
Petchareff, “why all top secret 
agents have to look like bankers. 
Anastina says Colonel James was 
operated on by a Monsieur Fanti. 
What do you know about him?” 

“He’s a theatrical surgeon.” 

“You’re not playing one of 
your jokes, Pashkov?” 

“Hardly.” 

“You’d better be in my office 
in ten minutes. What size hospi- 
tal gown?” 

“Short and fat,” Pashkov said, 
and switched off. 

Most countries wanted to 
break his neck, and his own 
Motherland did not always trust 
him. But he enjoyed his work — 
enjoyed it as much as his closest 
professional rival, Colonel James, 
U.S.A. 

DASHKOV landed on the roof 
*- of Intelligence in the north- 
east corner of the Kremlin, 
hitched up his pants and rode 
down. 

In his office, Petchareff re- 
moved the cigar from his mouth 
as Pashkov came in. “Medvedev 
get my orders?” 

“He’s preparing a new super- 
patriotic writer to replace Boris 
Knackenpast,” Pashkov reported. 
“When you give the word, he will 
call Izvestia and tell them Boris 
is dead.” 

Petchareff glanced at his cal- 
endar. “We have two other state 



74 



GALAXY 



funerals this week. You made it 
plain, I hope, we want no repeti- 
tion of Knackenpast’s peace non- 
sense.’’ 

“No more Gandhi or Schwei- 
tzer influences. The new litera- 
ture,” Pashkov promised, raising 
a chubby finger, “will be a pearl 
necklace of government slogans.” 

Nadezhda buzzed the inter- 
com. “The man from the Bolshoi 
Theater is here, Comrade.” 

“Send him in.” 

A small man hurried into the 
room. He had a narrow face and 
the mustache of a mouse and a 
mousy nose, but his eyes were big 
rabbit eyes. He bowed twice 
quickly, placed a package on the 
desk with trembling forepaws 
and bowed twice again. 

Petchareff tore open the pack- 
age. “You got the real thing? No 
bad imitation?” 

“Exactly, exactly,” the mouse 
piped. “No difference, Comrade.” 
He held his paws as in prayer 
and his pointed mouth quivered. 

Petchareff held up the hospi- 
tal gown. On the back of the 
gown was printed in indelible 
ink: 

Stockholm national hospital 
courtesy of 
Coca-Cola 

Petchareff tossed the gown to 
Pashkov. “This is what Colonel 
James is wearing,” he said, dis- 



missing the mouse, who bowed 
twice and scurried out. 

“Try and split the allies,” 
Pashkov muttered, reading the 
legend on the gown. 

Petchareff blew cigar smoke in 
his face. “If Colonel James makes 
a monkey of you once more, 
you’re through, Pashkov. You 
don’t take your job seriously 
enough. You bungle this and I’ll 
have you transferred to our Cul- 
tural Information Center in Chi- 
cago.” 

Pashkov winced. 

“Now, you’ll go to Stockholm 
and switch places with the Amer- 
ican colonel and find out what 
they’re up to. Zubov’s kidnaping 
team is there already, at Hotel 
Reisen. Any questions?” 

“I thought Zubov was a zoo- 
logical warfare expert. What is 
he doing with a kidnaping team?” 
“His team is more agile. On 
your way.” 

In the front office, Pashkov 
stopped to kiss Nadezhda Brun- 
hildova goodby. “I may not re- 
turn from this dangerous mission. 
Give me a tender kiss.” 

Nadezhda was a big girl with 
hefty arms, captain of her local 
broom brigade. “Monster!” She 
seized him by the collar. “Is 
Anastina dangerous?” 

“Darling!” 

“Bitter sweetness!” she howled, 
dropping him. “Go, love. Make 
me miserable.” 



THE COOL WAR 



75 



P ASHKOV spent an hour at 
Central Intelligence. Noth- 
ing unusual going on in Stock- 
holm: an industrial exhibit, the 
Swedish Academy in session, a 
sociology seminar on prison re- 
form, a forty-man trade mission 
from India. 

An addendum to the Stock- 
holm file listed two Cuban agents 
operating from Fralsningsar- 
men’s Economy Lodgings. They 
were buying small arms and am- 
munition. He thought a moment, 
impressed the Cubans’ address 
on his memory, and went to his 
flier. 

He did not fly to Hotel Reisen 
at once. Zubov’s kidnaping team 
could wait. Coming slowly over 
Stockholm he spotted the Na- 
tional Hospital and circled. 

A line of ambulance fliers was 
parked on the ground in the am- 
bulance court. On the hospital 
roof, he noticed, apart from pri- 
vate fliers, stood a flier that re- 
sembled his own. 

He veered away, detoured 
around Riddarholmen, and five 
minutes later landed on the roof 
of Fralsningsarmen’s Economy 
Lodgings — the Salvation Army 
flophouse. 

“My Cuban friends,” Pashkov 
inquired in fluent English at the 
desk on the top floor. “Are they 
in?” 

The old desk clerk looked like 
a stork. “Yu, room six fifteen,” 



he clacked. “Tree floors down. 
Aer yu Amerikan?” 

“Brazil.” 

“Ah so? You sprikker goot 
Inglish laik me.” 

“Very kind of you.” 

He rode down three floors, 
found room 615, and stopped as 
he heard voices within. 

“. dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis, 
siete. By seven o’clock tonight, 
okay, Gringo?” 

“What do you expect for seven 
thousand bucks — service? Look, 
boys, I’m just a honest business- 
man. I can’t get it for you today. 
Have a seegar, Pablo.” 

“Tfu!” 

“All rightie, your cause is my 
cause. Maybe I can get it for you 
tonight. But you’ll have to pay in 
advance. What do you say, Fran- 
cisco?” 

“I counted the money. It is 
waiting for you. You deliver, we 
pay.” 

“But how can I trust you? I 
like you boys, I know you like 
me, but business is business. I 
gotta give something to my job- 
ber, don’t I?” 

“Gringo!” 

At that moment Pashkov 
knocked on the door. 

From within: “Shh! Alguien 

llama a la puerta.” 

Pashkov knocked again and a v 
scuffle ensued within, the crack 
of a chair on a skull, the dragging 
of a beefy body into a closet, and 



the slam of the closet door. 

“Yu?” 

“Buenas tardes,” Pashkov said 
through the door. “Asuntos muy 
importantes.” 

The door opened a crack and 
two dark eyes in a young bearded 
face peered out. “Eh?” 

“Gospodin Pashkov, para ser- 
vir a usted.” 

The door opened enough to 
admit the roly-poly visitor into 
the room. The other Cuban, also 
bearded and wearing a fatigue 
cap, held a revolver. 

“No gun-play, Caballeros,” 
Pashkov went on in Spanish. “We 
are in the Salvation Army char- 
ity house, not in a two-peso thril- 
ler. Besides, I deliver before I 
ask payment.” 

“Deliver what, senor?” 

“We favor any disturbance 
close to the United States. May 
I sit down?” 

Between two beds were 
stacked some dozen crates of ex- 
plosives. A small table was lit- 
tered with papers. 

Sitting down at the table, 
Pashkov’s elbow rested on an in- 
voice, and moments later the 
invoice was tucked in his pocket. 

“What kind of ammunition do 
you need, Caballeros?” 

The Cubans looked at each 
other. “Thirty-o-six caliber, two- 
twenty grain. How much can you 
deliver?” 

“Two thousand rounds.” 

THE COOL WAR 



“Not much.” 

“Maybe three thousand. I’ll 
toss in a box of hand grenades 
and a can of lysergic acid diethyl- 
amide.” 

“You have that? You have 
LSD-25?” 

“I have that. When are you 
leaving Stockholm?” 

Again the young beards ex- 
changed looks. “Maybe we stay 
till tomorrow if you have more 
business. Three thousand rounds 
is not much. How much payment, 
senor?” 

“Two thousand kronor,” Pash- 
kov said, taking an envelope on 
the table and addressing it to 
Nadezhda Brunhildova, Kremlin, 
Moscow. No return address. 

“Do you trust us to send the 
money?” 

“It is bad for you if I do not 
trust you,” Pashkov said, smiling 
up at them. 

“You can trust us. We shall 
send the money. Please take a 
cigar.” 

Pashkov took four Havanas 
from the box they held out to 
him, stuck three in his breast 
pocket, and lit one. 

“You come again, senor. We 
make much business.” 

“Why not? Help retire Latin- 
American dictators to Siberia. 
More gold in Siberia than in Las 
Vegas.” 

“Hyi, hyi, that is funny. You 
come again.”

On his way up to the roof, 
Pashkov studied the invoice he 
had lifted. It was from a manu- 
facturer of sporting arms to 
Francisco Jesus Maria Gonzales, 
Salvation Army Economy Lodg- 
ings. He tucked the invoice into 
his inner pocket with a satisfied 
grunt, climbed into his flier and 
hopped over to Hotel Reisen, 
where Zubov’s kidnaping team 
was waiting for him. 

COMRADE ZUBOV, the kid- 
naping expert, was pacing 
the roof of Hotel Reisen. As 
Pashkov eased down in his flier, 
Zubov’s big front tooth flashed 
with delight. Pashkov felt like 
tossing him a bone. 

“Everything in order, Gospo- 
din Pashkov. Constant vigilance 
maintained at hospital by my 
two assistants. With your pardon, 
Comrade Petchareff urges all 
haste. Colonel James is due to 
leave the hospital tomorrow.” 
“Comrade Petchareff always 
urges haste. What else?” 

Zubov’s big tooth settled re- 
spectfully over his lower lip. His 
small eyes were so closely set 
that he looked cockeyed when he 
focused them on his superior. 

“With your pardon, I shall 
conduct you to our suite. Plans 
for kidnaping of Colonel James 
all ready.” 

“Here’s a cigar for you.” 
“Gratefully accepted. Reduced 



unavoidable fatalities to six.” Zu- 
bov counted on his long hard 
fingers. “Two watchmen, three 
nurses, one doctor.” 

In the hotel corridor, Zubov 
looked before and after, his eyes 
crossed suspiciously, and peered 
around corners. They got to their 
suite without incident, and Pash- 
kov gave him another cigar. 

“Gratefully accepted. Here is 
a map of hospital and grounds. 
Here is a map of twenty-third 
floor. Here is a map of Colonel 
James’ room. Here is hospital 
routine between midnight and 
dawn. With your pardon — ” 
Pashkov picked up the phone, 
dialed the Soviet embassy, and 
got the charge d’affaires. “How is 
your underdeveloped countries 
fund?” he asked. 

“Always depleted, always re- 
plenished.” 

“I don’t want any Russian 
brands.” 

“Nothing but foreign,” the 
charge buzzed. “We got almost 
everything now through an Amer- 
ican surplus outlet in Hamburg. 
Nationals get caught with Amer- 
ican goods, Americans get 
blamed. Wonderful confusion. 
What do you need?” 

“Thirty-o-six two-twenty, three 
thousand — if you have it.” 
“Most popular. What else?” 
“Pineapples — one crate.” 
“Only confiscated German po- 
tatoes. Will that do?” 



78 



GALAXY 



“Fine. And a small can of sen- 
timental caviar.” 

“Too risky.” 

“It’s all right. It will fall to 
local authorities by tomorrow.” 

Pashkov put down the re- 
ceiver. Give the Cubans enough 
to expect more — make sure 
they stay in town. 

^UBOV was cross-checking his 
^kidnaping plans. He said, 
“With your pardon, do we take 
Colonel James alive or dead-or- 
alive?” 

“Alive.” 

Zubov pulled a long face. 
“Dead-or-alive would be easier, 
Gospodin Pashkov. Fast, clean 
job.” 

Pashkov squinted at Zubov’s 
crossed eyes. “Have you had your 
eyes examined lately?” 

“No need,” Zubov assured him 
with a smile. “I see more than 
most people.” 

Pashkov held up his remaining 
cigar. “How many cigars in my 
hand?” 

“Two.” 

At that moment the door 
opened and Zubov’s kidnaping 
team lumbered in. They were a 
couple of big apes dressed in blue 
canvas shoes, red trousers, yel- 
low jackets, white silk scarves, 
sport caps and sun glasses. 

“What are you doing here?” 
cried Zubov. “Why aren’t you 
observing the hospital?” 



“Dhh, you said to report . 
um ... if something happened,” 
the first ape said in a thick voice. 

“Well?” 

“Victim’s room lights out,” the 
ape said. 

“My assistants,” Zubov intro- 
duced them to Pashkov. “Line 
up, line up, lads. With your par- 
don, they are good lads. This is 
Petya, and this is Kolya. No, this 
is Kolya and this one is Petya.” 

“Twins?” 

“Not exactly. Same genetic ex- 
periment. Good lads. Stand 
straight, Petya. Don’t curl your 
feet like that, Kolya, I’ve told 
you before. Why didn’t you 
shave your hands today?” 

Kolya looked guiltily at his 
hands. 

“They’ve made progress,” Zu- 
bov assured Pashkov, pulling a 
small whip from his hip pocket. 
“Straight, lads, straight,” he flick- 
ed the whip. “We have com- 
pany.” 

“Are their costumes your own 
idea?” 

“With your pardon, for pur- 
poses of concealment. What are 
your orders?” 

Pashkov told them to pick up 
the boxes of ammunition at the 
embassy and deliver them to the 
Cubans, and then to commandeer 
a private automobile. 

“We have autos at the em- 
bassy pool,” Zubov suggested. 

“I want a vehicle off the street. 



THE COOL WAR 



79 



Then report back here with your 
lads.” 

Petya gave Kolya a box on the 
ear. 

“Boys, boys!” Zubov cracked 
the whip. “Out you go. A job for 
Gospodin Pashkov, lads. They 
don’t get enough exercise,” he 
grinned, backing out after them. 
“With your pardon, I’ll thrash 
them later.” 

And they were gone. Pashkov 
turned to the hospital maps and 
studied them before taking a 
nap. 

S HORTLY before dawn, Zu- 
bov’s team returned, their 
mission accomplished. 

“With your pardon, an excel- 
lent Mercedes,” Zubov reported. 

Pashkov had changed into the 
hospital gown with the Coca-Cola 
legend on the back. He glanced 
at his watch. It was four o’clock 
in the morning. 

He tossed his bundle of cloth- 
ing to the first ape. “Take my 
flier back to Moscow, Kolya lad. 
Give my clothes to Nadezhda 
Brunhildova, and tell Comrade 
Petchareff to expect Colonel 
James today.” 

Clutching the bundle, Kolya 
stuck his tongue out at Petya and 
bounded out of the room. They 
waited at the window until they 
saw Kolya take off in Pashkov’s 
flier. Then they made their way 
down the service stairs to the al- 



ley, Pashkov dressed only in the 
hospital gown; got into the stolen 
Mercedes and drove to the Na- 
tional Hospital, all three leaning 
forward. 

In the ambulance court, Zubov 
and Petya moved quickly to a 
Red Cross flier. Pashkov dropped 
the invoice he had lifted from 
the Cubans on the front seat of 
the stolen car, and followed. 

A watchman emerged from his 
hut, looked idly up at the rising 
ambulance, and shuffled back to 
his morning coffee. 

As Petya brought the flier to 
a hovering stop against Colonel 
James’ window, Pashkov bounc- 
ed into the room; Zubov drew 
his gun and jumped in after. 

Colonel James awoke, turned 
on the night lamp, and sat up 
in the bed, his eyes blinking. 

Pashkov stood looking at Col- 
onel James. The resemblance be- 
tween them was remarkable. Zu- 
bov’s eyes were crossed with 
astonishment. 

“My dear Gospodin Pashkov!” 
Colonel James greeted him in 
Russian, yawning. “How kind of 
you to visit me. Do sit down.” 
Not only was his Russian good; 
his voice was a good imitation of 
Pashkov’s voice. 

“You’re not really sick?” Pash- 
kov asked, sitting down on the 
bed. 

“Not physically. But imagine 
my psychological condition.

GALAXY 



When I look in the mirror — ” 
The colonel shuddered. 

“I hope your sacrifice won’t be 
permanent?” Pashkov said. 

“That would be too much. 
How is my Russian? The truth, 
now.” 

“Excellent. Put up your gun, 
Zubov. Colonel James and I 
don’t get to talk very often.” 
“And a pity we don’t. Good 
manners accomplish more than 
an opera full of cloaks and dag- 
gers. Cigarette?” 

“Gratefully accepted,” Zubov 
said, slipping his gun into its 
holster with a flourish. 

44\7T)UR treatment is over, 
then?” Pashkov asked. 
“You are ready for your assign- 
ment?” 

“Ready.” 

“And that is?” 

“Delicate, very delicate. I must 
report to the Palace this morn- 

• W 

ing. 

“Shall I kidnap him now?” 
Zubov interrupted, puffing con- 
ceitedly on his cigarette. 

“Mind your language, Zubov. 
May I ask, Colonel — do you 
want me to think I am falling 
into a trap?” 

“No, no, my friend. I am only 
doing my best not to show my 
surprise at seeing you again.” 
The colonel got out of bed and 
sat down on Pashkov’s other side. 
“Zubov will make your trip 



to Moscow comfortable. All right, 
Zubov.” 

Zubov focused his crossed 
eyes on Pashkov. 

“Take him straight to Petch- 
areff,” Colonel James said to Zu- 
bov. “I’ll report as soon as I 
know what these Swedes are up 
to.” 

Zubov seized Pashkov by the 
scruff of the neck and dragged 
him towards the window. 

“Hold your claws, Zubov lad,” 
Pashkov said. “You have got the 
wrong man, can’t you see? That 
is Colonel James.” 

“Eh?” 

“Use your eyes, blockhead. I 
am Pashkov.” 

Zubov did use his eyes. He 
looked from one to the other, and 
back. The more he focused, the 
more his eyes crossed. “Eh?” 

Colonel James sat calmly on 
the bed. He said, “Carry him 
out.” 

Zubov lifted Pashkov off the 
floor, crashed with his weight 
against the wall, but held on, 
grinned and staggered with Pash- 
kov in his arms to the window. 

“You miserable idiot,” Pash- 
kov shouted. “You’ll get a rest 
cure for this!” 

Zubov dropped him, pulled his 
gun and backed off into a corner. 
“How can I tell you two apart 
just by looking!” he cried hysteri- 
cally. “I’m not a learned man.” 

“One small but decisive proof,”

Pashkov said, unbuttoning his 
hospital gown. “I have a mole.” 

Zubov yanked the colonel up 
by an arm. “Send me to rest 
cures, will you?” 

Colonel James sighed. “I guess 
we have to keep up appearances,” 
he muttered, and climbed out the 
window into the hovering ambu- 
lance. Zubov leaped in after, and 
they were off. 

HTHE suit of clothes hanging in 
the closet might have been 
Pashkov’s own, identical with the 
clothes Kolya had taken to Mos- 
cow not an hour before. Even 
the underwear had facsimiles of 
the Order of Lenin sewn in. 

Satisfied, he crawled into the 
bed and fell into a pleasant 
snooze. 

He was awakened by the 
nurse, Anastina Bjorklund — alias 
Anastasia Semionovna Bezum- 
naya, formerly of the Stakhano- 
vite Booster’s Committee, Mos- 
cow Third Worker’s District. 

“Wonderful morning, Colonel 
James!” 

Petchareff seldom let one 
agent know what another was 
doing. 

She put a big breakfast tray on 
Pashkov’s lap. “Cloudy, damp, 
and windy. London stock market 
caves in, race riots in South Af- 
rica, famine in India, earthquake 
in Japan, floods in the United 
States, general strike in France, 



new crisis in Berlin. I ask you, 
what more can an idealist want?” 

“Good morning, Miss Bjork- 
lund.” 

The breakfast tray was cram- 
med with a liter of orange juice, 
four boiled eggs, six slices of ba- 
con, four pancakes, two pork 
chops, four slices of toast, a tum- 
bler of vodka, a pot of coffee and 
two cigars. 

“Ah, Colonel,” Anastina said as 
Pashkov fell to, “why did you let 
them change your face? It does 
not become you at all.” 

“Part of my job. Don’t you 
think I am more handsome 
now?” 

Anastina laughed shrilly. “That 
bulbous nose handsome? What 
Woman could fall in love with a 
nose like that?” 

“It shows determination. I 
wish I had this nose permanent- 
ly.” 

“You mustn’t talk like that. 
But I’ll ignore your nose if you 
tell me more about White Sands 
Proving Grounds, as you prom- 
ised.” 

“With pleasure, with pleasure,” 
he said, sinking his teeth into a 
pork chop, having seasoned the 
chop with the soft-boiled egg 
yolk. “But right now I’m in a 
hurry to get to the Palace. Give 
my shoes an extra shine, there’s 
a good girl.” 

“Oh, you and your secrets!” 

An hour later, Pashkov landed 

GALAXY 



on the Palace roof in Colonel 
James’ flier — an exact copy of 
his own flier. The Palace roof 
captain stared at him, then 
smiled nervously. 

“They are waiting for you in 
the Gustavus room, Colonel.” 
“Colonel? Do I still look like 
Colonel James?” 

“Oh, no, sir.” 

“Do I talk like Colonel 
James?” 

“You’ve changed completely, 
sir. If I didn’t know, I would 
swear you were the notorious 
Gospodin Pashkov.” 

“I am Gospodin Pashkov now, 
Captain. To everybody.” 

“Of course, sir. I’ll ring down 
you are coming.” 

Pashkov glanced at his watch. 
Colonel James would be landing 
in Moscow about now and taken 
to Comrade Petchareff for ques- 
tioning. 

A manservant in velvet cut- 
aways, patent leather shoes and 
white gloves, escorted Pashkov 
through rooms hungs with chan- 
deliers, tapestries, paintings. 
Pashkov entered the last room 
and stopped as the door clicked 
shut behind him. 

TN THE room were three men, 
all of whom he recognized: 
Professor Kristin of the Swedish 
Academy, a white-haired old man 
with a kind, intelligent face; the 
king, Gustavus IX, a thin old 

THE COOL WAR 




man stroking his Vandyke, sitting 
under a portrait of Frederick the 
Great; and Monsieur Fanti, the 
make-up surgeon. 

Pashkov bowed his head. 
“Your majesty. Gentlemen.” 

“Extraordinary!” Professor 
Kristin said. 

Pashkov turned to the surgeon. 
“Monsieur, should my face have 
such a frivolous expression?” 

M. Fanti raised his eyebrows, 
but did not answer. 

“I thought,” said Pashkov, 
“that Gospodin Pashkov’s face 
has a more brutal look.” 

“Propaganda,” said the artist. 
But' he came closer and looked at 
Pashkov’s face with sudden in- 
terest. 

Professor Kristin said, “Col- 
onel James, we presume you have 
studied the problem in detail. I’m 
afraid we have delayed announc- 
ing the Nobel prize for literature 
much too long. How soon can 
you bring Boris Knackenpast to 
Stockholm?” 

So there it was: Boris Knack- 
enpast a supreme success, as 
Pashkov had suspected. It would 
be amusing to tell robotist Med- 
vedev about it. 

“Delicate, very delicate,” Pash- 
kov said. “Everything depends on 
my not running into Gospodin 
Pashkov.” 

“We can’t wait any longer,” 
Professor Kristin said. “Fortun- 
ately, we have an ally in the 




82 



83 



enemy camp. The robotist, Med- 
vedev, is expecting you at Knack- 
enpast’s villa.” 

“Bad show,” M. Fanti said sud- 
denly. “No good. His left cheek- 
bone is at least four centimeters 
too high.” 

The men looked at the sur- 
geon, then at Pashkov. 

M. Fanti fingered Pashkov’s 
cheekbone. “How could I have 
made such a mistake! Just look 
at him. People laugh at such 
faces.” 

“How much time to correct the 
error then, Monsieur Fanti?” the 
king asked. 

“A week at least. His skin 
needs a rest. I must rework the 
whole left side of his face — it’s 
all lopsided.” 

“But we can’t spare a week,” 
Professor Kristin said. 

“With your majesty’s permis- 
sion,” Pashkov offered, “I am 
willing to go as I am. Indeed, my 
plans call for immediate depart- 
ure.” 

“It is a good thing you do for 
us, Colonel James,” Gustavus IX 
said, “and a courageous thing. 
Please accept our thanks.” 

Professor Kristin saw Pashkov 
to the door. “One suggestion, Col- 
onel. Your r’s are still too soft for 
a real Russian. Why do you 
Americans slur them like that? 
And I beg you, if you value your 
life, do not fail to watch your 
fricatives.” 



'T'HE roof captain saluted as 
Pashkov stepped out of the 
lift. His flier was serviced and 
ready. 

“What weather in Moscow, 
Captain?” 

“Ceiling four thousand. We’re 
having patrols half way out to 
sea. They are instructed to let 
you pass.” 

A small incident, the roof cap- 
tain explained. A Swedish Red 
Cross flier was missing from the 
National Hospital. Two Cuban 
agents had been arrested and a 
cache of small arms and ammu- 
nition was found. But no trace 
of the ambulance. 

“I suppose the Cubans deny 
stealing the ambulance?” Pash- 
kov asked. 

“They say they’ve been framed 
by a fat little Russian. But it’s 
transparent, a clumsy job. Im- 
agine, they left a stolen car in 
the ambulance court and in it 
an invoice for six cases of am- 
munition. It was traced to the 
Cubans in half an hour.” 

Pashkov climbed into his flier. 
“Well, it’s fashionable to blame 
the Russians for everything.” He 
waved his chubby hand, and took 
off. Flying over the Baltic, he set 
the controls on the Moscow 
beam. 

Ten minutes west of Moscow 
he tuned the communicator in on 
Petchareff’s office. 

“Seven One Three here, Na- 



dezhda. Tell Petchareff — no, let 
me talk to him.” 

“Seven One . but that’s im- 
possible! Gospodin Pashkov is in 
conference with Comrade Petch- 
areff.” 

“Stupid!” Petchareff’s voice 
sounded behind Nadezhda’s, and 
the speaker clicked and went 
dead. 

Pashkov dove into the clouds 
and brought his flier to a hover- 
ing stop. 

Petchareff did not believe he 
was Pashkov. Colonel James, it 
was clear, was at that moment in 
Petchareff’s office, impersonating 
Pashkov. And Zubov was prob- 
ably getting a rest cure. 

Pashkov crawled out of the 
cloud and skimmed northeast to 
Mir, Boris Knackenpast’s villa. 

“You came fast, sir,” the lieu- 
tenant of guards welcomed him 
at Mir. “We did not expect you 
for another fifteen minutes.” 

Fifteen minutes. The colonel 
was not wasting time. 

“Listen carefully, lieutenant.” 
Pashkov described the American 
agent. “But his left cheekbone is 
lower than mine — about four 
centimeters. He may be armed, 
so be careful.” 

The lieutenant stared. “Shall 
we kill him?” 

“No, no. Put him in a cage.” 

As Pashkov ran up the steps 
to the villa, the curtain in the 
vestibule window stirred. But 



when he entered, the vestibule 
was empty. 

He looked in the dining room, 
the music room, the library. No- 
body. The house was strangely 
quiet. He came to the door of the 
study and listened. Not a sound. 
He went in and there, behind the 
large writing desk, sat Boris 
Knackenpast. 

The robot was unscrewing 
screws imbedded in his neck. 

“My God, sir,” said Pashkov, 
“what are you doing?” 

r T'HE robot’s eyes, large disks 
1 of glittering mirror, flashed as 
he looked up. “Ah, Colonel 
James,” Boris said in a voice that 
seemed to come from a deep 
well. “Excuse the poor welcome, 
but I understand we have little 
time. You scared my valet; he 
thought you were Gospodin Pash- 
kov.” 

The door burst open and Med- 
vedev rushed in, the old valet at 
his heels. Medvedev stopped, 
gaped, then seized Pashkov’s 
hand. “Colonel James! What an 
artist, that Monsieur Fanti. But 
quick, Boris, Pashkov is on his 
way.” 

Boris pulled off his head, and 
crawled out of the robot shell. 
Pashkov saw Boris as he really 
was, a tall human with a gaunt, 
ascetic face. 

The sad thing about us, 
thought Pashkov, is that Medve- 



84 



GALAXY 



THE COOL WAR 



85 



dev could not trust even me. But 
then I could not trust Medvedev, 
either. Yes, that’s the trouble 
with us. 

“I hope you need no luggage, 
Mister Knackenpast,” Pashkov 
said. “We must be off at once.” 

“Too late!” the old valet said 
from the window. 

Colonel James had landed. 
But as he climbed down from his 
flier, the guards closed a circle 
about him. 

“He’ll keep,” Pashkov said, 
hitching up his pants. “Let’s be 
off, Mister Knackenpast. It won’t 
take long for Petchareff to smell 
us out.” 

“Look!” 

The guards fell back from the 
flier and snapped to attention. 
Chewing on his cigar furiously, 
out stepped Petchareff. 

Zubov leaped out next, his big 
front tooth flashing. Then his two 
assistants, Petya and Kolya, tum- 
bled out in their coats and hats. 
Last of all to emerge from the 
flier was Nadezhda Brunhildova. 

“Pretend not to know me, will 
he?” she yelled at Colonel James, 
picking up a rock. 

“Hold it, citizenress,” Colonel 
James said. 

“Citizenress, is it?” The rock 
flew over his head and felled Zu- 
bov. 

“I warned you both, no kitchen 
squabbles while on duty,” Petch- 
areff roared. He snapped an or- 



der to the lieutenants of guards, 
and the guards surrounded the 
house. 

“No alarm, no alarm,” Pashkov 
said, pulling Boris away from the 
window. “Mister Knackenpast, 
when you see your way clear to 
my flier, run for it. But get back 
into your robot costume.” 

“I can’t operate the machine.” 

“I’ll be right behind you. The 
rest of us will go out to Petch- 
areff.” 

As they came out, Petchareff 
was reviving Zubov by slapping 
his face. The kidnaping expert 
lay stretched cold on the ground, 
and Nadezhda Brunhildova stood 
by, holding the rock and weep- 
ing. 

Colonel James said, “There he 
is, the American spy.” 

Petchareff looked up as Pash- 
kov was led forward by the 
guards. “Not bad,” Petchareff 
said. “We could use Monsieur 
Fanti. What’s his price?” 

“Don’t you know me, chief? 
Me, Pashkov.” 

“Curse me,” Nadezhda said, 
staring at him. “Another Pash- 
kov.” 

A terrible howl came from 
Zubov. Petya and Kolya, imitat- 
ing Petchareff’s efforts to revive 
their master, were battering Zu- 
bov’s face with their slouched 
hats. 

“Stand back!” Kolya screamed, 
smashing his hat into Zubov’s 



86 



GALAXY 



face. “He is trying to say some- 
thing!” 

“He’s moving!” Petya kicked 
Zubov and looked up for ap- 
proval, his hair standing up like 
spikes. 

Petchareff slapped Kolya’s 
face and crushed the glowing 
end of his cigar on Petya’s fore- 
head. The apes reeled back to 
a tree. 

TJASHKOV whispered to Colo- 
nel James. 

“Capitalist hell and damnation, 
now I can’t tell them apart my- 
self,” Petchareff said. “Zubov!” 

“Hhng?” 

“Which one’s the real Pash- 
kov?” 

“Hhng?” 

But Colonel James was run- 
ning to the flier, throwing Na- 
dezhda’s rock at Petchareff and 
running. 

“Grenade!” Pashkov yelled, 
and flung himself to the ground. 

At the same moment Boris 
Knackenpast ran from the 
house to the flier, his robot gear 
clattering like Don Quixote’s 
armor. 

The guards scattered and 
dove for cover. 

“Down, lads! Grenade!” Pash- 
kov yelled. 

The two apes took up the cry, 
“Grenade, grenade!” and flat- 
tened themselves behind the tree. 

Nadezhda and Medvedev 



collided, digging in behind the 
valet. 

Only Petchareff remained 
standing. “Stop the robot!” 
Nobody moved. 

Boris reached the flier, Colo- 
nel James pulled him in, the 
engine hummed, and they were 
off. A moment later the flier 
vanished in the clouds towards 
Stockholm. 

Petchareff relit his cigar. 
“Tfui, tastes of monkey hair.” 
Medvedev shambled over. 
“Was the grenade a dud?” 

“One of these days I’ll catch 
you, Pashkov,” Petchareff spat. 
“Your deviousness, that’s one 
thing. It could be useful. But 
your levity — ” 

“Darling!” Nadezhda threw 
on Pashkov. 

“Not in public,” Pashkov said. 
“Wait a minute,” Petchareff 
said. “Nadezhda Brunhildova, 
how do you know he really is 
Pashkov? If he’s actually Colonel 
James, I can shoot him summar- 
ily. He does look like Colonel 
James to me.” 

“But if you’re mistaken?” 
Medvedev put in nervously. 

“We all make mistakes,” 
Petchareff said. “What would 
history be without mistakes?” 

“I don’t trust him either,” 
Nadezhda said. “But I know my 
Pashkov. If he’s not Pashkov, I 
shall let you know in the morn- 
ing.” — ANDREW FELTER

SOUNDING ROCKETS 
AND GEOPROBES 

rpHIS PIECE started out as a 
reply to a reader’s question 
that read about as follows: 
“Reading the daily papers and 
news magazines about rocket 
work I have come across many 
unfamiliar names, such as Strong- 
arm, Journeyman, Javelin, Scout 
and so on. They seem to be solid- 
fuel rockets, but that is all I could 
find out about them. Were these 
rockets developed in secrecy?” 
I started out by replying that

the term “secrecy” was not quite 
right; “privacy” would be a bet- 
ter word. I had the privacy of a 
research laboratory in mind, 
where a group of men ponders 
a “mission” (a job to be per- 
formed) and tries to think of 
the most efficient and inexpen- 
sive way to perform it. To take 
an actual case, I continued, an 
instrument package weighing 45 
pounds had to be carried into the 
lower portion of the inner Van 



Allen belt, to an altitude of 600 
miles. Of course a Thor rocket 
could have done it, or a Jupiter, 
not to mention the Atlas. But 
none of these big liquid-fuel rock- 
ets can conceivably be called in- 
expensive. And they all need 
ground facilities for firing which 
exist in only a few places. 

To do it more cheaply — and 
at the same time to avoid the 
need for extensive ground facili- 
ties — it was decided to use a

rocket made up of existing hard- 
ware. An Honest John artillery 
rocket (minus its warhead, of 
course) was the first stage. The 
second stage consisted of a Nike- 
Ajax booster. The third stage 
was another Nike booster, and 
an Altair rocket the fourth stage. 
The whole was named Argo D-4 
or Javelin. And it did its job. 
The instruments were carried 
600 miles up on July 7, 1959. 

Having come to that point in 
my reply I decided that other 
readers might have the same or 
a similar question in their minds 
and that a column on sounding 
rockets might be of all-around 
interest. 

TTHrst let’s explain what the term 
“sounding rocket” means. 
The word can be traced back to 
the French ballon sonde, which 
meant a small balloon carrying 
meteorological instruments. In 



English this became “sounding 
balloon”, and an instrument- 
carrying rocket logically became 
a “sounding rocket”. They are 
fired more or less vertically. The 
deviation from the true vertical 
is introduced to make the 
burned-out rocket or rocket 
stages fall into the sea. Other- 
wise every empty stage would 
have to be supplied with a para- 
chute for a soft landing, which 
would not only complicate the 
whole business but would also re- 
duce the instrument load that can 
be carried. Parachutes are not de- 
vices of zero weight. In fact they 
are surprisingly heavy. 

Originally the term sounding 
rockets referred to such rockets, 
which would take over from the 
balloons at 20 miles — the high- 
est a balloon can go and still 
carry something — and extend 
the region of atmosphere re- 
search to 100 miles. But by now 



1.000 miles is not very difficult 
any more. For this reason an ar- 
tificial distinction has been intro- 
duced. Up to 4,000 miles above 
sea level — one earth radius — 
instrument-carrying rockets are 
called sounding rockets. Beyond 

4.000 miles they are called geo- 
probes. Beyond, say, 100,000 
miles they become lunar probes 
or planetary probes, depending 
on their destination. 

The idea of the sounding rock- 
et goes back to professor Robert 
H. Goddard who was the first 
(in 1919) to make detailed sug- 
gestions. 

During the period from 1925 
to 1935 various experimenters, 
in the United States as well as in 
Germany and Russia, occasion- 
ally stuck a barometric instru- 
ment into the nose cone of their 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



rockets. But that does not make 
them the first sounding rockets. 
In the first place, none of these 
experimental rockets ever car- 
ried a full set of the basic meteor- 
ological instruments, measuring 
atmospheric pressure, tempera- 
ture and humidity. In the second 
place, no rocket fired prior to 
1942 ever exceeded the altitude 
which could be investigated by 
balloons, too. 

The first rocket which de- 
serves the designation sounding 
rocket was the WAC Corporal, 
which was developed in Cali- 
fornia in 1944 and 1945, and 
test-fired from the White Sands 
Proving Ground in October, 
1945. The overall length of the 
WAC Corporal was 16 feet, the 
diameter 12 inches, the diameter 
measured over the fins 48 inches

and the takeoff weight 665 
pounds. The empty weight of 
the rocket was 275 pounds, pro- 
pellant weight (nitric acid and 
aniline) 365 pounds and the 
payload weight 25 pounds. 
Started by a solid-fuel booster, 
the WAC Corporal climbed to 
43.5 miles. 

The career of the WAC Cor- 
poral was cut short by the fact 
that seventy German V-2 rockets 
became available very soon after 
the Corporal’s first test flights. In 
addition to that, the WAC Cor- 
poral did have a shortcoming. 
The payload weight of 25 pounds 
was enough for most experiments 
in upper-atmosphere exploration. 
But the payload space was gen- 
erally considered too small. Sci- 
entific instruments at that time 
often did not weigh much, but 
they did take up a great deal of 
space. Miniaturization was still 
in the future. 

On the other hand, the V-2s, 
which were used because they 
were available, were generally 
speaking too big. They could 
carry a total of 2,310 pounds to 
an altitude of 100 miles. Of this 
total payload weight, 1,055 
pounds were available for instru- 
ments. Nose cone and counter- 
weight accounted for the other 
1,255 pounds. But that much 
weight-carrying capacity was 
needed only in very rare cases — 



for example in cosmic-ray re- 
search, where heavy lead shield- 
ing had to be carried. 

Since the WAC Corporal was 
not quite what was wanted — - 
and since the V-2s, one day, 
would all be gone — there was 
clearly a need for a new sound- 
ing rocket. One that was con- 
ceived and designed to be an in- 
strument carrier before the first 
line was drawn on the drafting 
board. The Applied Physics Lab- 
oratory of Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity supplied the original de- 
sign, the Navy’s Bureau of Ord- 
nance supplied the first funds, 
Douglas Aircraft Company and 
Aerojet, Inc. (now Aerojet-Gen- 
eral) shared the work of building 
it. The rocket was the Aerobee, 
somewhat larger than the WAC 
Corporal (overall length about 
19 feet with a diameter of 15 
inches) but using the same fuels. 

^FHE Aerobee was ready for its 
first test firing on November 
24, 1947, but the first flight was 
not an unqualified success. The 
rocket yawed and the fuel flow 
had to be stopped by radio com- 
mand. For this reason it reached 
only an altitude of 190,000 feet. 

The second flight, made on 
March 5, 1948,' came off as 

planned. The six-foot solid-fuel 
booster accelerated the rocket to 
about 1,000 feet per second and 



92 



GALAXY

burnout. (Courtesy Cooper Development Corp.) 

then dropped off. At that instant 
the liquid-fuel motor took over 
and lifted the rocket (in 34 sec- 
onds of burning time) to an alti- 
tude of 95,000 feet. The velocity 
after the fuel was used up was 



4,100 feet per second, and this 
resulted in a coasting flight to a 
peak altitude of 372,000 feet. 
The third Aerobee, fired on April 
13, 1948, reached about the same 
altitude, while the fourth, fired 
on July 26, 1948, climbed to 
slightly Over 70 miles. 

A true sounding rocket had 
been created, with a vertical 
range of about 70 miles if the 
payload was 150 pounds. Heav- 
ier payloads could be carried if 
necessary, though of course this 
depressed the peak altitude. Nat- 
urally a payload weighing less 
than 150 pounds increased the 
peak altitude. 

While the Aerobee did the at- 
mosphere-sounding jobs that had 
to be done, a number of other 
developments began. One was 
simply an improved Aerobee. Its 
manufacturer, Aerojet, told the 
Air Force and the Navy that a 
better rocket was possible if 
more magnesium alloy and a 
new type of stainless steel were 
used in the construction. Both 
Air Force and Navy were inter- 
ested, and the new version was 
designed and built. It was called 
the Aerobee-Hi. The diameter 
was the same as that of the Aero- 
bee, but the rocket was longer, 
the Air Force version about 21 
feet, the Navy version about 
23 Vz feet. The altitude at which 
the liquid-fuel motor cut off was

93 



pushed nearly 30,000 feet higher 
than that of the Aerobee, and the 
peak altitude, with a 120-pound 
payload, was calculated to be 
165 miles. 

Four years elapsed from the 
first proposal for the Aerobee-Hi 
to the first firing at White Sands 
on May 2, 1956. The first firing 
was disappointing, because only 
the booster ignited; the rocket 
fell back from an altitude of 
10,000 feet and exploded on im- 
pact. The second and third fir- 
ings also fell short of the goal, 
but on June 29, 1956, an Aero- 
bee-Hi carried a 120-pound pay- 
load to 163 miles. 

By the end of May, 1961, a 
total of 207 Aerobees had been 
fired, 112 Aerobee-His and one 
experimental model called Astro- 
bee. They had been the work- 
horses of upper-atmosphere re- 
search for about a decade. 

But there had been other de- 
velopments too. 

T O explain one of the problems 
which faced designers of 
sounding rockets we have to dis- 
cuss the problem of air resistance 
to some extent. 

Above an altitude of 100,000 
feet air resistance becomes fairly 
negligible. Once a rocket has 
passed this critical altitude it can 
move as fast, and accelerate as 
sharply, as desired. But those 



first 100,000 feet are not easy. 
An old rule of thumb has it that 
air resistance increases with 
about the square of the velocity. 
If you move twice as fast, you 
find four times as much air re- 
sistance; if you move three times 
as fast, you have nine times the 
air resistance to contend with. 
Hence a rocket which becomes 
very fast very soon will spend a 
great deal of its energy just fight- 
ing air resistance. 

Well, this being the case, why 
don’t we accelerate very gently 
to avoid excessive air resistance? 

But if we did this we would 
be wasting an awful lot of fuel. 
Remember, please, that a rocket 
will use up fuel not accelerating 
or climbing at all, but just hover- 
ing at a given altitude. The prob- 
lem is to find an acceleration 
which does not waste fuel by 
being too gentle, but which also 
does not waste fuel by being too 
violent and thus creating exces- 
sive air resistance. For the large 
liquid-fuel rockets with long 
burning times this problem could 
be solved. Being very heavy at 
the outset, they climb slowly at 
first, increasing not only their 
velocity but also their accelera- 
tion as they reach areas of suc- 
cessively lesser atmospheric den- 
sities. 

For smaller rockets Professor 
Hermann Oberth had suggested 



94 



GALAXY 




Production line of Aerobee rockets at Azusa, Calif. 



a way out as early as 1923. He 
proposed to nestle the rocket in 
a launching ring. This was to be 
connected by long ropes to two 
small dirigibles which first climb 
as high as they can, then pull 
apart from each other to provide 
a space between them for the 
rocket to ascend. By that maneu- 
ver at least the very densest lay- 
ers of the atmosphere — say the 
first four miles — could be 
avoided. 

Oberth’s idea, in a modified 



form, was carried out by Dr. 
James A. Van Allen in 1951 and 
1952. Since this was a combina- 
tion of a rocket with a balloon 
the device was called a Rockoon. 
The balloon was a plastic bal- 
loon, the rocket the then new 
solid-fuel Deacon rocket. 

By present-day standards the 
Deacon is a small rocket, but it 
was astonishing how high it 
could go by just being spared 
the trouble of penetrating the 
densest layers of the atmosphere.

The DAN rocket. (Dimensions in inches.) 



A Deacon fired from the ground 
reached about an altitude of 60,- 
000 feet. But the same rocket 
lifted to 60,000 feet by means of 
a balloon and ignited at that alti- 
tude would go to 60 miles. 

Of course nothing is com- 
pletely without drawbacks. The 
rockoon method cannot be used 
on windy days. Laying out a 
large plastic balloon for inflation 
is a delicate and difficult job, and 
if the wind velocity is above a 
certain mark it simply cannot be 
done. 

However, if a rockoon can be 
launched, no other method of 
getting instruments into the up- 
per atmosphere can compete in 
inexpensiveness. Dr. Van Allen 
has pointed out that a payload 
of eight pounds can be flown to 
a peak altitude of 75 miles for 
a total cost of $750 — which in- 
cludes the price of the rocket, 
the balloon and the helium 
needed to inflate it. A payload 
of 35 pounds can be flown to 65 
miles for $1,300, and if obsolete 
military rockets can be used one 
can transport eight pounds to 45 



miles for $250. Small wonder 
that this method was used exten- 
sively during the International 
Geophysical Year; the United 
States alone made 86 rockoon 
flights. 

In the rockoon technique the 
rocket is suspended in such a 
way that the balloon is missed 
by the ascending rocket. This 
does not constitute a saving, for 
the balloon is lost just the same. 
Another method would be to 




96 



GALAXY 




The ASP. (Courtesy Cooper Development Corp.) 



have the rocket suspended verti- 
cally and to shoot through the 
balloon. (The rocket can tear 
through the thin plastic without 
an appreciable loss in velocity.) 
This has been done only once, 
during Project Farside in 1957. 
Project Farside was supposed to 
reach an altitude of 4,000 miles, 
but it was one of those projects 
where all kinds of unforeseen ac- 
cidents happen; the best shot 
produced by Project Farside, out 
of six attempts, probably went to 
3,000 miles. It is necessary to 
say “probably” because nobody 
can be certain; the transmitter 
failed at 2,700 miles while the 
rocket was still rising. 

Perhaps there would have been 
more, except for sputnik and the 
changes in policy that followed. 



W HILE lifting the rocket by 
balloon was one method of 
circumventing high air resistance 
in the lower atmosphere, delayed 
ignition of the upper stages 
proved to be another workable 
method. 

Solid-fuel rockets, which had 
been steadily improved since 
about 1950 and had also steadily 
grown larger, do have higher ac- 
celerations than large liquid-fuel 
rockets. While nothing much can 
be done about this for each sin- 
gle rocket, excessive air resist- 
ance can be avoided by letting 
some time pass between the 
burnout of the first stage and the 
ignition of the second stage. 

The first sounding rockets to 
utilize ignition delay for reaching 
high altitudes were two rockets

called DAN (from? Deacon And 
Nike). The characteristics of the 
Nike booster are listed in the 
table. The Deacon rocket was 
107 inches long (without nose 
cone), and had a diameter of 
6.25 inches and a gross weight 
at launching of 217.6 pounds. 
The burning time was only 2.8 
seconds, the thrust around 6,000 
pounds. 

The two DAN rockets were 
alike, except that one carried 34 
pounds of payload and the other 
one, the second, shot a payload 
of 39 pounds. The difference was 
due to a sphere which was 
ejected in flight. The purpose of 
the sphere ejection was that the 
falling of a sphere of known di- 
ameter and weight would give a 
clue to the density of the air 
through which it fell. 

Round No. 1 was fired on 
April 8, 1955, Round No. 2 on 
June 24, 1955, both from Wal- 
lops Island. Burning time of the 
Nike booster is 3.5 seconds. Then 
the two stages separated, both 
climbing. The ignition of the 
Deacon rocket was supposed to 
be delayed for 15.5 seconds, but 
the actual delay was 17 seconds 
in the first shot and 12.8 seconds 
in the second shot. The results 
of the two shots are summarized 
in the diagram. 

Only two DAN rockets were 
fired, then a new combination, 



using the same method, was in- 
troduced. This was the Nike- 
Cajun, with a Cajun rocket as 
the upper stage. The Cajun is 
slightly larger and somewhat 
more powerful. The first Nike- 
Cajun (fired July 6, 1956) 

reached 425,000 feet. The shot 
labeled N-C 11, fired November 
7, 1956, reached 576,000 feet. 
Several others went to around 
550,000 feet. 

It was proved possible that 
high altitudes — satellite alti- 
tudes, as we would say now — 
could be reached by combina- 
tions of relatively inexpensive 
rockets, provided the payload 
did not weigh too much. Thus 
began the era of the solid-fuel 
sounding rockets. 

Not all of them were combina- 
tions of rockets. Some were sin- 
gle-stage devices. Two of these 
shall be mentioned, the ASP 
(Atmosphere Sounding Projec- 
tile) developed by Cooper Devel- 
opment Corporation in Monro- 
via, California, and the ARCAS, 
developed by Atlantic Research 
Corporation in Alexandria, Vir- 
ginia. Like ASP, the name 
ARCAS is composed of the first 
letters of the words of a longer 
name — but two different ex- 
planations are being offered. One 
is All-purpose Rocket for the 
Collection of Atmospheric Sound- 
ings; the other is Atlantic Re-

Without deciding which inter- 
pretation is correct I’ll proceed 
to a description of the rocket. It 
is a very slender rocket, only 
4.5 inches in diameter but with 
an overall length of 96.3 inches, 
if equipped with the standard 26- 
inch instrumentation nose. If the 
payload weighs 12 pounds, the 
takeoff weight is 77 pounds. 

In most solid-fuel rockets the 
propelling charge (it is called a 
“grain” even if weighs 900 
pounds) has the shape of a cylin- 
der, with a center hole which is 
often star-shaped. Ignition takes 
place in that center hole so that 



the grain burns from the inside 
out, lasting for only a few sec- 
onds but delivering a great deal 
of thrust. The “grain” of the 
ARCAS is solid and burns from 
its rear end forward; this kind 
has been called a “cigarette burn- 
er” since it burns like a cigarette. 
Of course, this method prolongs 
the burning time. The ARCAS 
burns for 30 seconds with a 
thrust of 336 pounds. 

r I ''HE ARCAS has been used 
since 1959 for routine mete- 
orological work, by Air Force 
units as well as by airlines like 
Pan American. It has also been 
used for high-altitude research 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



99 



and for support operations in 
long-range ballistic-missile tests. 
By the end of November, 1962, 
more than 1,000 ARCAS rockets 
had been fired. 

After the propellant grain 
has burned, a so-called “delay 
column” is ignited. This burns 
quietly for about 100 seconds, 
during which time the rocket 
coasts to its peak altitude, which 
lies between 200,000 and 280,000 
feet, depending on the payload 
carried. Then, about 130 seconds 
after takeoff, the delay column 
ignites the separation charge. 
Payload is separated from the 
body of the rocket. The payload 
returns by parachute to be picked 
up while the rocket body simply 
falls to the ground. During the 
winter of 1962-63 our research 
station at McMurdo Sound in 
Antarctica (of course they had 
summer then) used boosted 
ARCAS rockets for high-altitude 
research. The rocket is the same, 
but it has a short solid-fuel 
booster which increases the peak 
altitude to 330,000 feet. 

The other single-stage solid- 
fuel sounding rocket, the ASP, 
is not only an example of a suc- 
cessful development, but also one 
of Twentieth Century speed. The 
Navy’s Bureau of Ships wanted 
such a rocket and sent the con- 
tract to Cooper Development 
Corporation on July 8, 1955. 



“The rocket,” a company spokes- 
man reported later, “was de- 
signed, fabricated, modified, stat- 
ic-fired and flight-tested in less 
than six months after receipt of 
the contract. The first prototype 
rocket was launched successfully 
at the Naval Air Missile Test 
Center, Point Mugu, Calif., on 
December 27, 1955.” 

The ASP is slightly larger and 
heavier than the ARCAS (see 
table) and is of the short dura- 
tion with high thrust type. There 
are three versions which differ 
from each other as follows: 

ASP-1 ASP-1 1 ASP-Ill 

Thrust, in pounds 5850 8680 9600 

Burning time, sec. 5.3 3.6 3.3 

Propellant weight, 

pounds 150 152 138 

Empty weight 

of case, pounds 40 40 40 

When launched vertically the 
ASP will reach 198,000 feet with 
a 25-pound payload, and 169,000 
feet with a 50-pound payload. 
Launched at an elevation of 4,000 
feet (White Sands), the figures 
are 245,000 feet and 197,000 
feet, respectively. 

But the figures are really im- 
pressive if the launch takes place 
75,000 feet up, say from a Sky- 
hook balloon. Then the 25-pound 
payload will be carried to 635,- 
000 feet and the 50-pound pay- 
load to 490,000 feet. It can be

seen at a glance that the ASP 
is a fine upper stage for a heavier 
booster. 

And that brings me back to 
the combinations which caused 
the letter that caused this col- 
umn, the rockets with names like 
Javelin, Journeyman and so 
forth. The makeup of the Javelin 
has already been explained. 
Others of the same kind are: 

Argo E-5, Jason: 1st stage, 

Honest John; 2nd stage, Nike 
booster; 3rd stage, another Nike 
booster; 4th stage, a Recruit 
rocket; 5th stage, a Thiokol T-55 
rocket. 

Argo D-8, Journeyman: 1st, 

Thiokol Sergeant rocket with two 
Recruit rockets burning simulta- 
neously; 2nd, Grand Central 
Lance rocket; 3rd, another Lance; 
4th Altair. 

Trailblazer: 1st, Honest John; 
2nd, Nike booster; 3rd, Lance; 
4th, Thiokol T-40; 5th, Thiokol 
T-55. 

Strongarm: 1st, Honest John; 
2nd, Nike booster; 3rd, another 
Nike booster; 4th, a Yardbird 
rocket; 5, scaled-down Sergeant 
rocket. 

It should be mentioned that in 
some cases the stages do not all 
fire on the upward leg of the tra- 
jectory. Often the arrangement 
is that the top two stages do not 
fire until the rocket begins to re- 
enter the atmosphere. The pur- 



pose is, of course, to test re-entry 
conditions at speeds which cor- 
respond to the re-entry of a mis- 
sile after a 4,000 mile journey 
through space. 

Finally, we have among these 
composite rockets NASA’s Scout, 
where the first stage is an Algol, 
the second a Castor, the third an 
Antares and the fourth an Altair. 
As befits this collection of ab- 
ducted star names, the Scout has 
satellite capability. Several satel- 
lites now orbiting the earth were 
put into orbit by Scout rockets. 
And the Scout is also the only 
one which could be a geoprobe.

Illustrated by SCHELLING 
Granthan's mission was the most 
vital of the war. It would mean 
instant victory — but for whom? 



I 

TN the dream I was swimming 
^ in a river of white fire and 
the dream went on and on. And 
then I was awake — and the fire 
was still there, fiercely burning 
at me. 

I tried to move to get away 
from the flames, and then the 
real pain hit me. I tried to go 
back to sleep and the relative 
comfort of the river of fire, but it 
was no go. For better or worse, 
I was alive and conscious. 

I opened my eyes and took a 
look around. I was on the floor 
next to an unpadded acceleration 
couch — the kind the Terrestrial 
Space Arm installs in seldom- 



used lifeboats. There were three 
more couches, but no one in 
them. I tried to sit up. It wasn’t 
easy but, by applying a lot more 
will-power than should be re- 
quired of a sick man, I made 
it. I took a look at my left 
arm. Baked. The hand was only 
medium rare, but the forearm 
was black, with deep red showing 
at the bottom of the cracks where 
the crisped upper layers had 
burst . 

There was a first-aid cabinet 
across the compartment from me. 
I tried my right leg, felt broken 
bone-ends grate with a sensation 
that transcended pain. I heaved 
with the other leg, scrabbled 
with the charred arm. The crawl 



.102 



G AL'.XY 



to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary’s 
trek up Everest, but I reached it 
after a couple of years, and found 
the microswitch on the floor that 
activated the thing, and then I 
was fading out again . 

1 CAME out of it clear-headed 
but weak. My right leg was 
numb, but reasonably comfort- 
able, clamped tight in a walking 
brace. I put up a hand and felt 
a shaved skull, with sutures. It 
must have been a fracture. The 
left arm — well, it was still there, 
wrapped to the shoulder and 
held out stiffly by a power truss 
that would keep the scar tissue 
from pulling up and crippling me. 
The steady pressure as the truss 
contracted wasn’t anything to do 
a sense-tape on for replaying at 
leisure moments, but at least the 
cabinet hadn’t amputated. I 
wasn’t complaining. 

As far as I knew, I was the first 
recorded survivor of contact with 
the Gool — if I survived. 

I was still a long way from 
home, and I hadn’t yet checked 
on the condition of the lifeboat. 
I glanced toward the entry port. 
It was dogged shut. I could see 
black marks where my burned 
hand had been at work. 

I fumbled my way into a 
couch and tried to think. In my 
condition — with a broken leg 
and third-degree burns, plus a 
fractured skull — I shouldn’t have 



been able to fall out of bed, much 
less make the trip from Belshaz- 
zar’s CCC to the boat; and how 
had I managed to dog that port 
shut? In an emergency a man 
was capable of great exertions. 
But running on a broken femur, 
handling heavy levers with char- 
red fingers and thinking with a 
cracked head were overdoing it. 
Still, I was here — and it was 
time to get a call through to TSA 
headquarters. 

I flipped the switch and gave 
the emergency call-letters Col. 
Ausar Kayle of Aerospace Intel- 
ligence had assigned to me a few 
weeks before. It was almost five 
minutes before the “acknowl- 
edge” came through from the 
Ganymede relay station, another 
ten minutes before Kayle’s face 
swam into view. Even through 
the blur of the screen I could see 
the haggard look. 

“Granthan!” he burst out. 
“Where are the others? What 
happened out there?” I turned 
him down to a mutter. 

“Hold on,” I said. “I’ll tell you. 
Recorders going?” I didn’t wait 
for an answer — not with a 
fifteen-minute transmission lag. I 
plowed on: 

“Belshazzar was sabotaged. So 
was Gilgamesh — I think. I got 
out. I lost a little skin, but the 
aid cabinet has the case in hand. 
Tell the Med people the drinks 
are on me.” 



END AS A HERO 



103 



I finished talking and flopped 
back, waiting for Kayle’s reply. 
On the screen, his flickering 
image gazed back impatiently, 
looking as hostile as a swing-shift 
ward nurse. It would be half an 
hour before I would get his reac- 
tion to my report. I dozed off — 
and awoke with a start. Kayle 
was talking. 

“ — your report. I won’t mince 
words. They’re wondering at 
your role in the disaster. How 
does it happen that you alone 
survived?” 

“How the hell do I know?” I 
yelled — or croaked. But Kayle’s 
voice was droning on: 

“. you Psychodynamics peo- 
ple have been telling me the Gool 
may have some kind of long- 
range telehypnotic ability that 
might make it possible for them 
to subvert a loyal man without 
his knowledge. You’ve told me 
yourself that you blacked out 
during the attack — and came to 
on the lifeboat, with no recollec- 
tion of how you got there. 

“This is war, Granthan. War 
against a vicious enemy who 
strike without warning and with- 
out mercy. You were sent out to 
investigate the possibility of — 
what’s that term you use? — 
hyper-cortical invasion. Y ou 

know better than most the risk 
I’d be running if you were al- 
lowed to pass the patrol line. 

“I’m sorry, Granthan. I can’t 



let you land on Earth. I can’t ac- 
cept the risk.” 

“What do I do now?” I 
stormed. “Go into orbit and eat 
pills and hope you think of some- 
thing? I need a doctor!” 

Presently Kayle replied. 
“Yes,” he said. “You’ll have to 
enter a parking orbit. Perhaps 
there will be developments soon 
which will make it possible to . 
ah . restudy the situation.” He 
didn’t meet my eye. I knew what 
he was thinking. He’d spare me 
the mental anguish of knowing 
what was coming. I couldn’t real- 
ly blame him; he was doing what 
he thought was the right thing. 
And I’d have to go along and pre- 
tend — right up until the war- 
heads struck — that I didn’t know 
I’d been condemned to death. 

II 

T TRIED to gather my wits and 
think my way through the sit- 
uation. I was alone and injured, 
aboard a lifeboat that would be 
the focus of a converging flight 
of missiles as soon as I ap- 
proached within battery range of 
Earth. I had gotten clear of the 
Gool, but I wouldn’t survive my 
next meeting with my own kind. 
They couldn’t take the chance 
that I was acting under Gool 
orders. 

I wasn’t, of course. I was still 
the same Peter Granthan, psy-

chodynamicist, who had started 
out with Dayan’s fleet six weeks 
earlier. The thoughts I was hav- 
ing weren’t brilliant, but they 
were mine, all mine . 

But how could I be sure of 
that? 

Maybe there was something in 
Kayle’s suspicion. If the Gool 
were as skillful as we thought, 
they would have left no overt in- 
dications of their tampering — 
not at a conscious level. 

But this was where psychody- 
namics training came in. I had 
been reacting like any scared 
casualty, aching to get home and 
lick his wounds. But I wasn’t just 
any casualty. I had been trained 
in the subtleties of the mind — 
and I had been prepared for just 
such an attack. 

Now was the time to make use 
of that training. It had given me 
one resource. I could unlock the 
memories of my subconscious — 
and see again what had hap- 
pened. 

I lay back, cleared my mind of 
extraneous thoughts, and con- 
centrated on the trigger word 
that would key an auto-hypnotic 
sequence . 

Sense impressions faded. I was 
alone in the nebulous emptiness 
of a first-level trance. I keyed a 
second word, slipped below the 
misty surface into a dreamworld 
of vague phantasmagoric figures 
milling in their limbo of 



sub-conceptualization. I penetra- 
ted deeper, broke through into 
the vividly hallucinatory third 
level, where images of mirror- 
bright immediacy clamored for 
attention. And deeper . 

T HE immense orderly confu- 
sion of the basic memory 
level lay before me. Abstracted 
from it, aloof and observant, the 
monitoring personality-fraction 
scanned the pattern, searching 
the polydimensional continuum 
for evidence of an alien intrusion. 
And found it. 

As the eye instantaneously de- 
tects a flicker of motion amid an 
infinity of static detail, so my 
inner eye perceived the subtle 
traces of the probing Gool mind, 
like a whispered touch deftly re- 
arranging my buried motivations. 

I focused selectively, tuned to 
the recorded gestalt. 

“It is a contact, Effulgent 
One!’' 

“Softly, now! Nurture the 
spark well. It but trembles at the 
threshold . 

“It is elusive, Master! It wrig- 
gles like a gorm-worm in the eat- 
ing trough!” 

A part of my mind watched as 
the memory unrelled. I listened 
to the voices — yet not voices, 
merely the shape of concepts, in- 
describably intricate. I saw how 
the decoy pseudo-personality 
which I had concretized for the 



purpose in a hundred training 
sessions had fought against the 
intruding stimuli — then yielded 
under the relentless thrust of the 
alien probe. I watched as the 
Gool operator took over the mo- 
tor centers, caused me to crawl 
through the choking smoke of the 
devastated control compartment 
toward the escape hatch. Fire 
leaped up, blocking the way. I 
went on, felt ghostly flames 
whipping at me — and then the 
hatch was open and I pulled my- 
self through, forcing the broken 
leg. My blackened hand fumbled 
at the locking wheel. Then the 
blast as the lifeboat leaped clear 
of the disintegrating dreadnought 
— and the world-ending impact 
as I fell. 

At a level far below the con- 
scious, the embattled pseudo- 
personality lashed out again — 
fighting the invader. 

“Almost it eluded me then, 
Effulgent Lord. Link with this 
lowly one!” 

“Impossible! Do you forget all 
my teachings? Cling, though you 
expend the last filament of your 
life-force!” 

Free from all distraction, at a 
level where comprehension and 
retention are instantaneous and 
total, my monitoring basic per- 
sonality fraction followed the 
skillful Gool mind as it engraved 
its commands deep in my sub- 
conscious. Then the touch with- 

END AS A HERO 




drew, erasing the scars of its pas- 
sage, to leave me unaware of its 
tampering — at a conscious level. 

Watching the Gool mind, I 
learned. 

The insinuating probe — a 
concept regarding which psycho- 
dynamicists had theorized — -was 
no more than a pattern in empti- 
ness . 

But a pattern which I could 
duplicate, now that I had seen 
what had been done to me. 

Hesitantly, I felt for the im- 
material fabric of the continuum, 
warping and manipulating it, 
copying the Gool probe. Like 
planes of paper-thin crystal, the 
polyfinite aspects of reality 
shifted into focus, aligning them- 
selves. 

Abruptly, a channel lay open. 
As easily as I would stretch out 
my hand to pluck a moth from a 
night-flower, I reached across the 
unimaginable void — and sensed 
a pit blacker than the bottom 
floor of hell, and a glistening dark 
shape. 

There was a soundless shriek. 
“Effulgence! It reached out — 
touched me!” 

¥ TSING the technique I had 
grasped from the Gool itself, 
I struck, stifling the outcry, in- 
vaded the fetid blackness and 
grappled the obscene gelatinous 
immensity of the Gool spy as it 
spasmed in a frenzy of xenopho-

bia — a ton of liver writhing at 
the bottom of a dark well. 

I clamped down control. The 
Gool mind folded in on itself, 
gibbering. Not pausing to rest, I 
followed up, probed along my 
channel of contact, tracing pat- 
terns, scanning the flaccid Gool. 
mind . 

I saw a world of yellow seas 
lapping at endless shores of mud. 
There was a fuming pit, where 
liquid sulphur bubbled up from 
some inner source, filling an im- 
mense natural basin. The Gool 
clustered at its rim, feeding, each 
monstrous shape heaving against 
its neighbors for a more favor- 
able position. 

I probed farther, saw the great 
cables of living nervous tissue 
that linked each eating organ 
with the brain-mass far under- 
ground. I traced the passages 
through which tendrils ran out to 
immense caverns where smaller 
creatures labored over strange 
devices. These, my host’s mem- 
ory told me, were the young of 
the Gool. Here they built the 
fleets that would transport the 
spawn to the new worlds the 
Prime Overlord had discovered, 
worlds where food was free for 
the taking. Not sulphur alone, 
but potassium, calcium, iron and 
all the metals — riches beyond 
belief in endless profusion. No 
longer would the Gool tribe clus- 
ter — those who remained of a 



once-great race — at a single feed- 
ing trough. They would spread 
out across a galaxy — and be- 
yond. 

But not if I could help it. 

The Gool had evolved a plan 
— but they’d had a stroke of bad 
luck. 

In the past, they had managed 
to control a man here and there, 
among the fleets, far from home, 
but only at a superficial level. 
Enough, perhaps, to wreck a ship, 
but not the complete control 
needed to send a man back to 
Earth under Gool compulsion, to 
carry out complex sabotage. 

Then they had found me, 
alone, a sole survivor, free from 
the clutter of the other mind- 
fields. It had been their misfor- 
tune to pick a psychodynamicist. 
Instead of gaining a patient 
slave, they had opened the fort- 
ress door to an unseen spy. Now 
that I was there, I would see 
what I could steal. 

A timeless time passed. I 
wandered among patterns of 
white light and white sound, 
plumbed the deepest recesses of 
hidden Gool thoughts, fared 
along strange ways examining 
the shapes and colors of the con- 
cepts of an alien mind. 

I paused at last, scanning a 
multi-ordinal structure of pattern 
within pattern; the diagrammed 
circuits of a strange machine. 

I followed through its logic-se- 

GALAXY 



quence; and, like a bomb-burst, 
its meaning exploded in my 
mind. 

From the vile nest deep under 
the dark surface of the Gool 
world in its lonely trans-Plutoni- 
an orbit, I had plucked the ulti- 
mate secret of their kind. 

Matter across space. 

66'V7’OU’VE got to listen to me, 
Kayle,” I shouted. “I 
know you think I’m a Gool robot. 
But what I have is too big to let 
you blow it up without a fight. 
Matter transmission! You know 
what that can mean to us. The 
concept is too complex to try to 
describe in words. You’ll have to 
take my word for it. I can build 
it, though, using standard com- 
ponents, plus an infinite-area an- 
tenna and a moebius-wound coil 
— and a few other things. 

I harangued Kayle for a while, 
and then sweated out his answer. 
I was getting close now. If he 
couldn’t see the beauty of my 
proposal, my screens would start 
to register the radiation of war- 
heads any time now. 

Kayle came back — and his 
answer boiled down to “no.” 

I tried to reason with him. I 
reminded him how I had readied 
myself for the trip with sessions 
on the encephaloscope, setting up 
the cross-networks of conditioned 
defensive responses, the shunt 
circuits to the decoy pseudo-per-

sonality, leaving my volitional 
ego free. I talked about sublim- 
inal hypnotics and the resilience 
quotient of the ego-complex. 

I might have saved my breath. 

“I don’t understand that psy- 
chodynamics jargon, Granthan,” 
he snapped. “It smacks of mys- 
ticism. But I understand what 
the Gool have done to you well 
enough. I’m sorry.” 

I leaned back and chewed the 
inside pf my lip and thought un- 
kind thoughts about Colonel 
Ausar Kayle. Then I settled 
down to solve the problem at 
hand. 

I keyed the chart file, flashed 
pages from the standard index on 
the reference - screen, checking 
radar coverages, beacon ranges, 
monitor stations, controller fields. 
It looked as though a radar-neg- 
ative boat the size of mine might 
possibly get through the de- 
fensive net with a daring pilot, 
and as a condemned spy, I could 
afford to be daring. 

And I had a few ideas. 

Ill 

nPHE shrilling of the proximity 
alarm blasted through the 
silence. For a wild moment I 
thought Kayle had beaten me to 
the punch; then I realized it was 
the routine DEW line patrol con- 
tact. 

“Z four-oh-two, I am reading 



108

your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee 
preparatory to picking up ap- 
proach orbit . .” 

The screen went on droning 
out instructions. I fed them into 
the autopilot, at the same time 
running over my approach plan. 
The scout was moving in closer. 

I licked dry lips. It was time to 
try. 

I closed my eyes, reached out 
— as the Gool mind had reached 
out to me — and felt the touch of 
a Signals Officer’s mind, forty 
thousand miles distant, aboard 
the patrol vessel. There was a 
brief flurry of struggle; then I 
dictated my instructions. The 
Signals Officer punched keys, 
spoke into his microphone: 

“As you were, Z four-oh-two. 
Continue on present course. At 
Oh-nineteen seconds, pick up 
planetary for re-entry and let- 
down.” 

I blanked out the man’s recol- 
lection of what had happened, 
caught his belated puzzlement as 
I broke contact. But I was clear 
of the DEW line now, rapidly 
approaching atmosphere. 

“Z four-oh-two,” the speaker 
crackled. “This is planetary con- 
trol. I am picking you up on 
channel forty-three, for re-entry 
and let-down.” 

There was a long pause. Then: 

“Z four-oh-two, countermand 
DEW Line clearance! Repeat, 
clearance countermanded! Emer- 



gency course change to standard 
hyperbolic code ninety-eight. Do 
not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do 
not attempt re-entry!” 

It hadn’t taken Kayle long to 
see that I’d gotten past the outer 
line of defense. A few more min- 
utes’ grace would have helped. 
I’d play it dumb, and hope for a 
little luck. 

“Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. 
Say, I’m afraid I missed part of 
that, fellows. I’m a little banged 
up — I guess I switched frequen- 
cies on you. What was that after 
‘pick up channel forty-three’ . .?” 
“Four-oh-two, sheer off there! 
You’re not cleared for re-entry!” 
“Hey, you birds are mixed up,” 
I protested. “I’m cleared all the 
way. I checked in with DEW — 

It was time to disappear. I 
blanked off all transmission, hit 
the controls, following my eva- 
sive pattern. And again I reached 
out — 

A radar man at a site in the 
Pacific, fifteen thousand miles 
away, rose from his chair, crossed 
the darkened room and threw a 
switch. The radar screens blanked 
off . 

For an hour I rode the long or- 
bit down, fending off attack after 
attack. Then I was clear, skim- 
ming the surface of the ocean a 
few miles southeast of Key West. 
The boat hit hard. I felt the floor 
rise up, over, buffeting me 
against the restraining harness. 



110 



GALAXY 



I hauled at the release lever, 
felt a long moment of giddy dis- 
orientation as the escape capsule 
separated from the sinking life- 
boat deep under the surface. 
Then my escape capsule was 
bobbing on the water. 

I would have to risk calling 
Kayle now — but by voluntarily 
giving my position away, I should 
convince him I was still on our 
side — and I was badly in need 
of a pick-up. I flipped the sending 
key. 

“This is z four-oh-two,” I said. 
“I have an urgent report for Col- 
onel Kayle of Aerospace Intelli- 
gence.” 

Kayle’s face appeared. “Don’t 
fight it, Granthan,” he croaked. 
“You penetrated the planetary 
defenses — God knows how. I — ” 
“Later,” I snapped. “How 
about calling off your dogs now? 
And send somebody out here to 
pick me up, before I add sea- 
sickness to my other complaints.” 
“We have you pinpointed,” 
Kayle cut in. “It’s no use fighting 
it, Granthan.” 

T felt cold sweat pop out on my 
forehead. “You’ve got to 
listen, Kayle,” I shouted. “I sup- 
pose you’ve got missiles on the 
way already. Call them back! I 
have information that can win 
the war — ” 

“I’m sorry, Granthan,” Kayle 
said. “It’s too late — even if I 



could take the chance you were 
right.” 

A different face appeared on 
the screen. 

“Mr. Granthan, I am General 
Titus. On behalf of your country, 
and in the name of the President 
— who has been apprised of this 
tragic situation — it is my priv- 
ilege to inform you that you will 
be awarded the Congressional 
Medal of Honor — posthumous- 
ly — for your heroic effort. Al- 
though you failed, and have in 
fact been forced, against your 
will, to carry out the schemes of 
the inhuman enemy, this in no 
way detracts from your gallant 
attempt. Mr. Granthan, I salute 
you.” 

The general’s arm went up in 
a rigid gesture. 

“Stow that, you pompous idiot!” 
I barked. “I’m no spy!” 

Kayle was back, blanking out 
the startled face of the general. 

“Goodbye, Granthan. Try to 
understand . .” 

I flipped the switch, sat grip- 
ping the couch, my stomach ris- 
ing with each heave of the float- 
ing escape capsule. I had per- 
haps five minutes. The missiles 
would be from Canaveral. 

I closed my eyes, forced my- 
self to relax, reached out . 

I sensed the distant shore, the 
hot buzz of human minds at work 
in the cities. I followed the coast- 
line, found the Missile Base,

flicked through the cluster of 
minds. 

“ — missile on course; do right, 
baby. That’s it, right in the slot.” 

I fingered my way through the 
man’s mind and found the con- 
trol centers. He turned stiffly 
from the plotting board, tottered 
to a panel to slam his hand 
against the destruct button. 

Men fell on him, dragged him 
back. “ — fool, why did you blow 
it?” 

I dropped the contact, found 
another, who leaped to the panel, 
detonated the remainder of the 
flight of six missiles. Then I with- 
drew. I would have a few min- 
utes’ stay of execution now. 

I was ten miles from shore. 
The capsule had its own power 
plant. I started it up, switched 
on the external viewer. I saw 
dark sea, the glint of star-light on 
the choppy surface, in the dis- 
tance a glow on the horizon that 
would be Key West. I plugged 
the course into the pilot, then 
leaned back and felt outward 
with my mind for the next at- 
tacker. 

IV 

TT was dark in the trainyard. I 
moved along the tracks in a 
stumbling walk. Just a few more 
minutes, I was telling myself. 
A few more minutes and you can 
lie down . rest . 




The shadowed bulk of a box 
car loomed up, its open door a 
blacker square. I leaned against 
the sill, breathing hard, then 
reached inside for a grip with 
my good hand. 

Gravel scrunched nearby. The 
beam of a flashlight lanced out, 
slipped along the weathered car, 
caught me. There was a startled 
exclamation. I ducked back, 
closed my eyes, felt out for his 
mind. There was a confused mur- 
mur of thought, a random intru- 
sion of impressions from the city 
all around. It was hard, too hard. 
I had to sleep — 

I heard the snick of a revolver 
being cocked, and dropped flat 
as a gout of flame stabbed toward 
me, the imperative Bam! echoing 
between the cars. I caught the 
clear thought: 

“God-awful looking, shaved 
head, arm stuck out; him all 
right—” 

I reached out to his mind and 
struck at random. The light fell, 
went out, and I heard the uncon- 
scious body slam to the ground 
like a poled steer. 

It was easy — if I could only 
stay awake. 

I gritted my teeth, pulled my- 
self into the car, crawled to a 
dark corner behind a crate and 
slumped down. I tried to evoke 
a personality fraction to set as a 
guard, a part of my mind to stay 
awake and warn me of danger. 



112 



GALAXY 



It was too much trouble. I re- 
laxed and let it all slide down 
into darkness. 

PT'HE car swayed, click-clack, 
click-clack. I opened my 
eyes, saw yellow sunlight in a 
bar across the litter on the floor. 
The power truss creaked, pulling 
at my arm. My broken leg was 
throbbing its indignation at the 
treatment it had received — walk- 
ing brace and all — and the 
burned arm was yelling aloud for 
more of that nice dope that had 
been keeping it from realizing 
how bad it was. All things con- 
sidered, I felt like a badly em- 
balmed mummy — except that I 
was hungry. I had been a fool not 
to fill my pockets when I left the 
escape capsule in the shallows off 
Key Largo, but things had been 
happening too fast. 

I had barely made it to the 
fishing boat, whose owner I had 
coerced into rendezvousing with 
me before shells started dropping 
around us. If the gunners on the 
cruiser ten miles away had had 
any luck, they would have fin- 
ished me — and the hapless fish- 
erman — right then. We rode out 
a couple of near misses, before I 
put the cruiser’s gunnery crew 
off the air. 

At a fishing camp on the beach, 
I found a car — with driver. He 
dropped me at the railyard, and 
drove off under the impression he 



was in town for groceries. He’d 
never believe he’d seen me. 

Now I’d had my sleep. I had to 
start getting ready for the next 
act of the farce. 

I pressed the release on the 
power truss, gingerly unclamped 
it, then rigged a sling from a strip 
of shirt tail. I tied the arm to my 
side as inconspicuously as pos- 
sible. I didn’t disturb the band- 
ages. 

I needed new clothes — or at 
least different ones — and some- 
thing to cover my shaved skull. I 
couldn’t stay hidden forever. The 
yard cop had recognized me at a 
glance. 

I lay back, waiting for the 
train to slow for a town. I wasn’t 
unduly worried — -at the moment. 
The watchman probably hadn’t 
convinced anyone he’d actually 
seen me. Maybe he hadn’t been 
too sure himself. 

The click-clack slowed and the 
train shuddered to a stop. I crept 
to the door, peered through the 
crack. There were sunny fields, a 
few low buildings in the distance, 
the corner of a platform. I closed 
my eyes and let my awareness 
stretch out. 

“ — lousy job. What’s the use? 
Little witch in the lunch room . 
up in the hills, squirrel hunting, 
bottle of whiskey . .” 

I settled into control gently, 
trying not to alarm the man. I 
saw through his eyes the dusty

box car, the rust on the tracks, 
the listless weeds growing among 
cinders, and the weathered 
boards of the platform. I turned 
him, and saw the dingy glass of 
the telegraph window, a sagging 
screen door with a chipped enam- 
eled cola sign. 

I walked the man to the door, 
and through it. Behind a lino- 
leum-topped counter, a coarse- 
skinned teen-age girl with heavy 
breasts and wet patches under 
her arms looked up without in- 
terest as the door banged. 

My host went on to the coun- 
ter, gestured toward the waxed- 
paper-wrapped sandwiches un- 
der a glass cover. “I’ll take ’em 
all. And candy bars, and ciga- 
rettes. And give me a big glass of 
water.” 

“Better git out there and look 
after yer train,” the girl said 
carelessly. “When’d you git so all- 
fired hungry all of a sudden?” 

“Put it in a bag. Quick.” 

“Look who’s getting bossy — ” 

My host rounded the counter, 
picked up a used paper bag, be- 
gan stuffing food in it. The girl 
stared at him, then pushed him 
back. “You git back around that 
counter!” 

She filled the bag, took a pen- 
cil from behind her ear. 

“That’ll be one eighty-five. 
Cash.” 

My host took two dog-eared 
bills from his shirt pocket, drop- 



ped them on the counter and 
waited while the girl filled a 
glass. He picked it up and started 
out. 

“Hey! Where you goin’ with 
my glass?” 

The trainman crossed the plat- 
form, headed for the boxcar. He 
slid the loose door back a few 
inches against the slack latch, 
pushed the bag inside, placed the 
glass of water beside it, then 
pulled off his grimy railroader’s 
cap and pushed it through 
the opening. He turned. The girl 
watched from the platform. A 
rattle passed down the line and 
the train started up with a lurch. 
The man walked back toward 
the girl. I heard him say: “Friend 
o’ mine in there — just passin 
through.” 

I was discovering that it wasn’t 
necessary to hold tight control 
over every move of a subject. 
Once given the impulse to act, he 
would rationalize his behavior, 
fill in the details — and never 
know that the original idea 
hadn’t been his own. 

I drank the water first, ate a 
sandwich, then lit a cigarette and 
lay back. So far so good. The 
crates in the car were marked 
“U. S. Naval Aerospace Station, 
Bayou Le Cochon”. With any 
luck I’d reach New Orleans in 
another twelve hours. The first 
step of my plan included a raid 
on the Delta National Labs; but 



114

that was tomorrow. That could 
wait. 

TT was a little before dawn 
when I crawled out of the car 
at a siding in the swampy coun- 
try a few miles out of New Or- 
leans. I wasn’t feeling good, but 
I had a stake in staying on my 
feet. I still had a few miles in me. 
I had my supplies — a few candy 
bars and some cigarettes — stuf- 
fed in the pockets of the tattered 
issue coverall. Otherwise, I was 
unencumbered. Unless you want- 
ed to count the walking brace on 
my right leg and the sling bind- 
ing my arm. 

I picked my way across mushy 
ground to a pot-holed black-top 
road, started limping toward a 
few car lights visible half a mile 
away. It was already hot. The 
swamp air was like warmed-over 
subway fumes. Through the 
drugs, I could feel my pulse 
throbbing in my various wounds. 
I reached out and touched the 
driver’s mind; he was thinking 
about shrimps, a fish-hook wound 
on his left thumb and a girl with 
black hair. “Want a lift?” he 
called. 

I thanked him and got in. He 
gave me a glance and I pinched 
off his budding twinge of curi- 
osity. It was almost an effort now 
not to follow his thoughts. It was 
as though my mind, having 
learned the trick of communica- 



tions with others, instinctively 
reached out toward them. 

An hour later he dropped me 
on a street corner in a shabby 
marketing district of the city and 
drove off. I hoped he made out 
all right with the dark-haired girl. 
I spotted a used-clothing store 
and headed for it. 

Twenty minutes later I was 
back on the sidewalk, dressed in 
a pinkish-gray suit that had 
been cut a long time ago by a 
Latin tailor — maybe to settle a 
grudge. The shirt that went with 
it was an unsuccessful violet. The 
black string tie lent a dubious 
air of distinction. I’d swapped 
the railroader’s cap for a tar- 
nished beret. The man who had 
supplied the outfit was still 
asleep. I figured I’d done him a 
favor by taking it. I couldn’t hope 
to pass for a fisherman — I 
wasn’t the type. Maybe I’d get 
by as a coffee-house derelict. 

I walked past fly-covered fish 
stalls, racks of faded garments, 
grimy vegetables in bins, enough 
paint-flaked wrought iron to cage 
a herd of brontosauri, and 
fetched up at a cab stand. I 
picked a fat driver with a wart. 

“How much to the Delta Na- 
tional Laboratories?” 

He rolled an eye toward me, 
shifted his toothpick. 

“What ya wanna go out there 
for? Nothing out there.” 

“I’m a tourist,” I said. “They

told me before I left home not to 
miss it.” 

He grunted, reached back and 
opened the door. I got in. He 
flipped his flag down, started up 
with a clash of gears and pulled 
out without looking. 

“How far is it?” I asked him. 

“It ain’t far. Mile, mile and a 
quarter.” 

“Pretty big place, I guess.” 

He didn’t answer. 

We went through a warehous- 
ing district, swung left along the 
waterfront, bumped over railroad 
tracks, and pulled up at a nine- 
foot cyclone fence with a locked 
gate. 

“A buck ten,” my driver said. 

I looked out at the fence, a 
barren field, a distant group of 
low buildings. “What’s this?” 

“This is the place you ast for. 
That’ll be a buck -ten, mister.” 

I touched his mind, planted a 
couple of false impressions and 
withdrew. He blinked, then 
started up, drove around the 
field, pulled up at an open gate 
with a blue-uniformed guard. He 
looked back at me. 

“You want I should drive in, 
sir?” 

“I’ll get out here.” 

He jumped out, opened my 
door, helped me out with a hand 
under my good elbow. “I’ll get 
your change, sir,” he said, reach- 
ing for his hip. 

“Keep it.” 



“Thank YOU.” He hesitated. 
“Maybe I oughta stick around. 
You know.” 

“I’ll be all right.” 

“I hope so,” "he said. “A man 
like you — you and me — ” he 
winked. “After all, we ain’t both 
wearing berets fer nothing.” 
“True,” I said. “Consider your 
tip doubled. Now drive away 
into the sunrise and forget you 
ever saw me.” 

TTE got into the car, beaming, 
and left. I turned and sized 
up the Delta Labs. 

There was nothing fancy 
about the place; it consisted of 
low brick and steel buildings, 
mud, a fence and a guard who 
was looking at me. 

I sauntered over. “I’m from 
Iowa City,” I said. “Now, the rest 
of the group didn’t come — said 
they’d rather rest one day. But I 
like to see it all. After all, I 
paid — ” 

“Just a minute,” the guard 
said, holding up a palm. “You 
must be lost, fella. This here 
ain’t no tourist attraction. You 
can’t come in here.” 

“This is the cameo works?” 
I said anxiously. 

He shook his head. “Too bad 
you let your cab go. It’s an hour 
yet till the bus comes.” 

A dun-painted staff car came 
into view, slowed and swung 
wide to turn in. I fingered the

driver’s mind. The car swerved, 
braked to a halt. A portly man 
in the back seat leaned forward, 
frowning. I touched him. He re- 
laxed. The driver leaned across 
and opened the door. I went 
around and got in. The guard 
was watching, open-mouthed. 

I gave him a two-finger salute, 
and the car pulled through the 
gate. 

“Stop in front of the electron- 
ics section,” I said. The car pulled 
up. I got out, went up the steps 
and pushed through the double 
glass doors. The car sat for a mo- 
ment, then moved slowly off. The 
passenger would be wondering 
why the driver had stopped — but 
the driver wouldn’t remember. 

I was inside the building now; 
that was a start. I didn’t like rob- 
bery in broad daylight, but it 
was a lot easier this way. I wasn’t 
equal to climbing any walls or 
breaking down any locked doors 
— not until I’d had a transfusion, 
a skin graft and about three 
months’ vacation on a warm 
beach somewhere. 

A man in a white smock 
emerged from a door. He started 
past me, spun — 

“I’m here about the garbage,” 
I said. “Damn fools will put the 
cans in with the edible. Are you 
the one called?” 

“How’s that?” 

“I ain’t got all the morning!” 
I shrilled. “You scientist fellers

are all alike. Which way is the 
watchamacallit — equipment 
lab?” 

“Right along there.” He point- 
ed. I didn’t bother to thank him. 
It wouldn’t have been in charac- 
ter. 

A thin man with a brush mus- 
tache eyed me sharply as I 
pushed through the door. I 
looked at him, nodding absently. 
“Carry on with your work,” I 
said. “The audit will be carried 
out in such a way as to disturb 
you as little as possible. Just 
show me your voucher file, if you 
please.” 

He sighed and waved toward a 
filing cabinet. I went to it and 
pulled a drawer open, glancing 
about the room. Full shelves 
were visible through an inner 
door. 

Twenty minutes later I left 
the building, carrying a sheet 
metal carton containing the elec- 
tronic components I needed to 
build a matter transmitter — ex- 
cept for the parts I’d have to fab- 
ricate myself from raw materials. 
The load was heavy — too heavy 
for me to carry very far. I parked 
it at the door and waited until a 
pick-up truck came along. 

It pulled over. The driver 
climbed out and came up the 
walk to me. “Are you — uh . ?” 
He scratched his head. 

“Right.” I waved at my loot. 
“Put it in the back.” He obliged.

Together we rolled toward the 
gate. The guard held up his hand, 
came forward to check the truck. 
He looked surprised when he 
saw me. 

“Just who are you, fella?” he 
said. 

I didn’t like tampering with 
people any more than I had to. 

It was a lot like stealing from a 
blind man: easy, But nothing taT' 
feel proud of. I gave him a light 
touch — just the suggestion that 
what I would say would be full 
of deep meaning. 

“You know — the regular 
Wednesday shipment,” I said 
darkly. “Keep it quiet. We’re all 
relying on you.” 

“Sure thing,” he said, stepping 
back. We gunned through the 
g3te. I glanced back to see him 
looking after the truck, thinking 
about the Wednesday shipment 
on a Friday. He decided it was 
logical, nodded his head and for- 
got the whole thing. 

V 

I ’D been riding high for a couple 
of hours, enjoying the success 
of the tricks I’d stolen from the 
Gool. Now I suddenly felt like 
something the student morti- 
cians had been practicing on. I 
guided my driver through a sec- 
ond-rate residential section, look- 
ing for an M.D. shingle on a 
front lawn. 



The one I found didn’t inspire 
much confidence — you could 
hardly see it for the weeds — 
but I didn’t want to make a big 
splash. I had to have an assist 
from my driver to make it to the 
front door. He got me inside, 
parked my box beside me and 
went off to finish his rounds, un- 
der the impression that it had 
been a dull morning. 

The doctor was a seedy, sev- 
entyish G.P. with a gross tremor 
of the hands that a good belt of 
Scotch would have helped. He 
looked at me as though I’d in- 
terrupted something that was 
either more fun or paid better 
than anything I was likely to 
come up with. 

“I need my dressing changed, 
Doc,” I said. “And maybe a 
shot to keep me going.” 

“I’m not a dope peddler,” he 
snapped. “You’ve got the wrong 
place.” 

“Just a little medication — 
whatever’s usual. It’s a burn. 
“Who told you to come here?” 
I looked at him meaningfully. 
“The word gets around.” 

He glared at me, gnashed his 
plates, then gestured toward a 
black-varnished door. “Go right 
in there.” 

He gaped at my arm when 
the bandages were off. I took a 
quick glance and wished I hadn’t. 
“How did you do this?” 
“Smoking in bed,” I said. 



118 



GALAXY 



“Have you got . something 
that . 

He caught me before I hit the 
floor, got me into a chair. Then he 
had that Scotch he’d been want- 
ing, gave me a shot as an after- 
thought, and looked at me nar- 
rowly. 

“I suppose you fell out of that 
same bed and broke your leg,” he 
said. 

“Right. Hell of a dangerous 
bed.” 

“I’ll be right back.” He turned 
to the door. “Don’t go away. I’ll 
just . get some gauze.” 

“Better stay here, Doc. There’s 
plenty of gauze right on that 
table.” 

“See here — ” 

“Skip it, doc. I know all about 
you.” 

“What?” 

“I said all about you.” 

He set to work then; a guilty 
conscience is a tough argument 
to answer. 

He plastered my arm with 
something and rewrapped it, 
then looked the leg over and 
made a couple of adjustments 
to the brace. He clucked over the 
stitches in my scalp, dabbed 
something on them that hurt like 
hell, then shoved an old-fash- 
ioned stickpin needle into my 
good arm. 

“That’s all I can do for you,” 
he said. He handed me a bottle 
of pills. “Here are some tablets 



to take in an emergency. Now 
get out.” 

“Call me a cab, Doc.” 

T listened while he called, then 
-*• lit a cigarette and watched 
through the curtains. The doc 
stood by, worrying his upper 
plate and eyeing me. So far I 
hadn’t had to tinker with his 
mind, but it would be a good 
idea to check. I felt my way 
delicately. 

— oh God, why did I .. long 
time ago . Mary ever knew . 
go to Arizona, start again, too 
old ... I saw the nest of fears 
that gnawed at him, the frustra- 
tion and the faint flicker of hope 
but not quite dead. I touched 
his mind, wiped away scars . 

“Here’s your- car,” he said. He 
opened the door, looking at me. 
I started past him. 

“Are you sure you’re all right?” 
he said. 

“Sure, Pop. And don’t worry. 
Everything’s going to be okay.” 

The driver put my boxes on 
the back seat. I got in beside him 
and told him to take me to a 
men’s clothing store. He waited 
while I changed my hand-me- 
downs for an off-the-hook suit, 
new shirt and underwear and a 
replacement beret. It was the 
only kind of hat that didn’t hurt. 
My issue shoes were still good, 
but I traded them in on a new 
pair, added a light raincoat, and

threw in a sturdy suitcase for 
good measure. The clerk said 
something about money and I 
dropped an idea into His mind, 
paused long enough to add a 
memory of a fabulous night with 
a redhead. He hardly noticed me 
leaving. 

I tried not to feel like a shop- 
lifter. After all, it’s not every 
day a man gets a chance to swap 
drygoods for dreams. 

In the cab, I transferred my 
belongings to the new suitcase, 
then told the driver to pull up 

at an anonymous-looking hotel. 
A four-star admiral with frayed 
cuffs helped me inside with my 
luggage. The hackie headed for 
the bay to get rid of the box un- 
der the impression I was a heavy 
tipper. 

I had a meal in my room, a 
hot bath, and treated myself to 
a three hour nap. I woke up feel- 
ing as though those student em- 
balmers might graduate after all. 

I thumbed through the phone 
book and dialed a number. 

“I want a Cadillac or Lincoln,” 
I said. “A new one — not the one 
you rent for funerals — and a 
driver who won’t mind missing 
a couple nights’ sleep. And 
put a bed pillow and a blanket 
in the car.” 

I went down to the coffee 
room then for a light meal. I had 
just finished a cigarette when 
the car arrived — a dark blue 



heavyweight with a high polish ■ 
and a low silhouette. 

“We’re going to Denver,” I 
told the driver. “We’ll make one 
stop tomorrow — I have a little 
shopping to do. I figure about 
twenty hours. Take a break 
every hundred miles, and hold it 
under seventy.” 

He nodded. I got in the back 
and sank down in the smell of 
expensive upholstery. 

“I’ll cross town and pick up 
U.S. 84 at — ” 

“I leave the details to you,” 

I said. He pulled out into the 
traffic and I got the pillow settled 
under me and closed my eyes. 
I’d need all the rest I could get 
on this trip. I’d heard that com- 
pared with the Denver Records 
Center, Fort Knox was a cinch. 
I’d find out for sure when I got 
there. 

T HE plan I had in mind wasn’t 
the best I could have con- 
cocted under more leisurely cir- 
cumstances. But with every cop 
in the country under orders to 
shoot me on sight, I had to move 
fast. My scheme had the virtue 
of unlikeliness. Once I was safe 
in the Central Vault — supposed 
to be the only H-bomb-proof 
structure ever built — I’d put 
through a phone call to the 
outside, telling them to watch a 
certain spot; say the big desk in 
the President’s office. Then I’d 



assemble my matter transmitter 
and drop some little item right in 
front of the assembled big shots. 
They’d have to admit I had 
something. And this time they’d 
have to start considering the pos- 
sibility that I wasn’t working for 
the enemy. 

It had been a smooth trip, and 
I’d caught up on my sleep. Now 
it was five A.M. and we were into 
the foothills, half an hour out of 
Denver. I ran over my lines, 
planning the trickiest part of the 
job ahead — the initial approach. 
I’d listened to a couple of news 
broadcasts. The FBI was still 
promising an arrest within hours. 
I learned that I was lying up, 
or maybe dead, in the vicinity of 
Key West, and that the situation 
was under control. That was fine 
with me. Nobody would expect 
me to pop up in Denver, still 
operating under my own power 
— and wearing a new suit at 
that. 

The Records Center was north 
of the city, dug into mountain- 
side. I steered my chauffeur 
around the downtown section, 
out a street lined with dark ham- 
burger joints and unlit gas sta- 
tions to where a side road 
branched off. We pulled up. 
From here on, things might get 
dangerous — if I was wrong about 
how easy it was all going to be. I 
brushed across the driver’s mind. 
He set the brake and got out. 



“Don’t know how I came to 
run out of gas, Mr. Brown,” he 
said apologetically. “We just 
passed a station but it was closed. 
I guess I’ll just have to hike back 
into town. I sure am sorry; I 
never did that before.” 

I told him it was okay, watched 
as he strode off into the pre- 
dawn gloom, then got into the 
front seat and started up. The 
gate of the Reservation surround- 
ing the Record Center was only 
a mile away now. I drove slowly, 
feeling ahead for opposition. 
There didn’t seem to be any. 
Things were quiet as a poker 
player with a pat hand. My 
timing was good. 

T stopped in front of the gate, 

under a floodlight and the 
watchful eye of an M.P. with a 
shiny black tommygun held at 
the ready. He didn’t seem sur- 
prised to see me. I rolled down 
the window as he came over to 
the car. 

“I have an appointment inside, 
Corporal,” I said. I touched his 
mind. “The password is ‘hot- 
point’.” 

He nodded, stepped back, and 
motioned me in. I hesitated. This 
was almost too easy. I reached 
out again . 

". middle of the night .

I pulled through the gate and

headed for the big parking lot, 
picking a spot in front of a ramp 
that led down to a tall steel door. 
There was no one in sight. I got 
out, dragging my suitcase. It was 
heavier now, with the wire and 
magnets I’d added. I crossed the 
drive, went up to the doors. The 
silence was eerie. 

I swept the area, searching for 
minds, found nothing. The shield- 
ing, I decided, blanked out 
everything. 

There was a personnel door 
set in the big panel, with a mas- 
sive combination lock. I leaned 
my head against the door and 
felt for the mechanism, turning 
the dial right, left, right . 

The lock opened. I stepped 
inside, alert. 

Silence, darkness. I reached 
out, sensed walls, slabs of steel, 
concrete, intricate mechanisms, 
tunnels deep in the ground . 

But no personnel. That was 
surprising — but I wouldn’t waste 
time questioning my good luck. 
I followed a corridor, opened 
another door, massive as a vault, 
passed more halls, more doors. 
My footsteps made muffled 
echoes. I passed a final door and 
came into the heart of the Rec- 
ords Center. 

There were lights in the 
chamber around the grim, fea- 
tureless periphery of the Central 
Vault. I set the valise on the 
floor, sat on it and lit a cigarette. 



So far, so good. The Records 
Center, I saw, had been over- 
rated. Even without my special 
knowledge, a clever locksmith 
could have come this far — or 
almost. But the Big Vault was 
another matter. The great inte- 
grating lock that secured it 
would yield only to a complex 
command from the computer set 
in the wall opposite the vault 
door. I smoked my cigarette and, 
with eyes closed, studied the 
vault. 

I finished the cigarette, step- 
ped on it, went to the console, 
began pressing keys, tapping out 
the necessary formulations. Half 
an hour later I finished. There 
was a whine from a servo motor; 
a crimson light flashed. I turned 
and saw the valve cycle open, 
showing a bright-lit tunnel within. 

I dragged my bag inside, threw 
the lever that closed the entry 
behind me. A green light went 
on. I walked along the narrow 
passage, lined with gray metal 
shelves stacked with gray steel 
tape drums, descended steps, 
came into a larger chamber fitted 
out with bunks, a tiny galley, 
toilet facilities, shelves stocked 
with food. There was a radio, a 
telephone and a second tele- 
phone, bright red. That would be 
the hot-line to Washington. This 
was the sanctum sanctorum, 
where the last survivors could 



122 



GALAXY 




wait out the final holocaust 
indefinitely. 

I opened the door of a steel 
cabinet. Radiation suits, tools, 
instruments. Another held bed- 
ding. I found a tape-player, tapes 
—even a shelf of books. I found 
a first aid kit and gratefully gave 
myself a hypo-spray jolt of neu- 
rite. My pains receded. 

I went on to the next room; 
there were wash tubs, a garbage 
disposal unit, a drier. There was 
everything here I needed to keep 
me alive and even comfortable 
until I could convince someone 
up above that I shouldn t be shot 
on sight. 

A heavy door barred the way 
to the room beyond. I turned a 
wheel, swung the door back, saw 
more walls lined with filing cab- 
inets, a blank facade of gray 
steel; and in the center of the 
room, alone on a squat table 
a yellow plastic case that any 
Sunday Supplement reader 
would have recognized. 

It was a Master Tape, the Ut- 
ter Top Secret Programming 
document that would direct the 
terrestrial defense in case of a 
Gool invasion. 

It was almost shocking to see 
it lying there — unprotected ex- 
cept for the flimsy case. The in- 
formation it contained in micro- 
micro dot form could put my 
world in the palm of the enemy s 
hand. 



The room with the tool kit 
would be the best place to work, 

I decided. I brought the suitcase 
containing the electronic gear 
back from the outer door where 
I’d left it, opened it and arranged 
its contents on the table. Ac- 
cording to the Gool these simple 
components were all I needed. 
The trick was in knowing how 
to put them together. 

There was work ahead of me 
now. There were the coils to 
wind, the intricate antenna ar- 
rays to lay out; but before I 
started, I’d take time to call 
Kayle — or whoever I could get 
at the other end of the hot-line. 
They’d be a little startled when 
I turned up at the heart of the 
defenses they . were trying to 
shield. 

I picked up the receiver and a 
voice spoke: 

“Well, Granthan. So you final- 
ly made it.” 

VI 

4£TTER e are your instruc- 
ts tions,” Kayle was saying. 
“Open the vault door. Come out 
— stripped — and go to the 
center of the parking lot. Stand 
there with your hands over your 
head. A single helicopter manned 
by a volunteer will approach and 
drop a gas canister. It won’t be 
lethal, I promise you that. Once 
you’re unconscious, I’ll personal-

ly see to it that you’re transported 
to the Institute in safety. Every 
effort will then be made to over- 
come the Gool conditioning. If 
we’re successful, you’ll be 
awakened. If not . .” 

He let the sentence hang. It 
didn’t need to be finished. I under- 
stood what he meant. 

I was listening. I was still not 
too worried. Here I was safe 
against anything until the food 
ran out — and that wouldn’t be 
for months. 

“You’re bluffing, Kayle,” I 
said. “You’re trying to put the 
best face on something that you 
can’t control. If you’d — ” 

“You were careless at Delta 
Labs, Granthan. There were too 
many people with odd blanks in 
their memories and too many 
unusual occurrences, all on the 
same day. You tipped your hand. 
Once we knew what we were up 
against, it was simply a matter of 
following you at an adequate dis- 
tance. We have certain shielding 
materials, as you know. We tried 
them all. There’s a new one that’s 
quite effective. 

“But as I was saying, we’ve 
kept you under constant surveil- 
lance. When we saw which way 
you were heading, we just stayed 
out of sight and let you trap 
yourself.” 

“You’re lying. Why would you 
want me here?” 

“That’s very simple,” Kayle 



said harshly. “It’s the finest trap 
ever built by man — and you’re 
safely in it.” 

“Safely is right. I have every- 
thing I need here. And that 
brings me to my reason for being 
here — in case you’re curious. I’m 
going to build a matter transmit- 
ter. And to prove my good faith, 
I’ll transmit the Master Tape to 
you. I’ll show you that I could 
have stolen the damned thing if 
I’d wanted to.” 

“Indeed? Tell me, Granthan, 
do you really think we’d be fools 
enough to leave the Master Tape 
behind when we evacuated the 
area?” 

“I don’t know about that — but 
it’s here.” 

“Sorry,” Kayle said. “You’re 
deluding yourself.” His voice was 
suddenly softer, some of the tri- 
umph gone from it. “Don’t bother 
struggling, Granthan. The finest 
brains in the country have com- 
bined to place you where you 
are. You haven’t a chance, except 
to do as I say. Make it easy on 
yourself. I have no wish to ex- 
tend your ordeal.” 

“You can’t touch me, Kayle. 
This vault is proof against a hell- 
bomb, and it’s stocked for a 
seige . .” 

“That’s right,” Kayle said. His 
voice sounded tired. “It’s proof 
against a hell-bomb. But what 
if the hell-bomb’s in the vault 
with you?” 



END AS A HERO 



125 



1 FELT like a demolition man, 
working to defuse a block- 
buster, who’s suddenly heard a 
loud click! from the detonator. I 
dropped the phone, stared 
around the room. I saw nothing 
that could be a bomb. I ran to 
the next room, the one beyond. 
Nothing. I went back to the 
phone, grabbed it up. 

“You ought to know better 
than to bluff now, Kayle!” I 
yelled. “I wouldn’t leave this 
spot now for half a dozen hypo- 
thetical hell-bombs!” 

“In the center room,” Kayle 
said. “Lift the cover over the 
floor drain. You’ll find it there. 
You know what they look like. 
Don’t tamper with its mechan- 
ism; it’s internally trapped. You’ll 
have to take my word for it we 
didn’t bother installing a 
dummy.” 

I dropped the phone, hurried 
to the spot Kayle had described. 
The bomb casing was there — a 
dull gray ovoid, with a lifting eye 
set in the top. It didn’t look 
dangerous. It just lay quietly, 
waiting . 

Back at the telephone, I had 
trouble finding my voice. “How 
long?” I croaked. 

“It was triggered when you 
entered the vault,” Kayle said. 
“There’s a time mechanism. It’s 
irreversible; you can’t force any- 
one to cancel it. And it’s no use 
your hiding in the outer passages. 



“The whole center will be 
destroyed in the blast. Even it 
can’t stand against a bomb bur- 
ied in its heart. But we’ll gladly 
sacrifice the center to eliminate 
you.” 

“How long!” 

“I suggest you come out quick- 
ly, so that a crew can enter the 
vault to disarm the bomb.” 

“How long!” 

“When you’re ready to emerge, 
call me.” The line went dead. 

I put the phone back in its 
cradle carefully, like a rare and 
valuable egg. 

I tried to think. I’d been charg- 
ing full speed ahead ever since 
I had decided on my scheme of 
action while I was still riding the 
surf off the Florida coast, and I’d 
stuck to it. Now it had hatched in 
my face — and the thing that 
had crawled out wasn’t the 
downy little chick of success. It 
had teeth and claws and was 
eyeing me like a basilisk . 

But I still had unplayed aces 

— if there was time. 

I had meant to use the matter 
transmitter to stage a dramatic 
proof that I wasn’t the tool of 
the enemy. The demonstration 
would be more dramatic than I’d 
planned. The bomb would fit the 
machine as easily as the tape. 
The wheels would be surprised 
when their firecracker went off 

— right on schedule — in the 
middle of the Mojave Desert. 



126 



GALAXY 



I set to work, my heart pound- 
ing. If I could bring this off — 
if I had time — if the transmitter 
worked as advertised . 

The stolen knowledge flowed 
smoothly, effortlessly. It was as 
though I had been assembling 
matter transmitters for years, 
knew every step by heart. First 
the moebius windings; yard after 
yard of heavy copper around a 
core of carbon; then the power 
supply, the first and second stage 
amplimitters . , . 

How long? In the sump in the 
next room, the bomb lay quietly 
ticking. How long . ? 

r I ''HE main assembly was ready 
now. I laid out cables, tying 
my apparatus in to the atomic 
power-source buried under the 
vault. The demand, for one short 
instant, would tax even those 
mighty engines. I fixed hooks at 
the proper points in the room, 
wove soft aluminum wire in the 
correct pattern. I was almost 
finished now. How long? I made 
the last connections, cleared 
away the litter. The matter trans- 
mitter stood on the table, com- 
plete. At any instant, the bomb 
would reduce it — and the se- 
cret of its construction — to in- 
candescent gas — unless I 
transmitted the bomb out of 
range first. I turned toward the 
laundry room — and the tele- 
phone rang. 



I hesitated, then crossed the 
room and snatched it up. 

“Listen to me,” Kayle said 
grimly. “Give me straight, fast 
answers. You said the Master 
Tape was there, in the vault with 
you. Now tell me: What does it 
look like?” 

“What?” 

“The . ah . dummy tape. 
What is its appearance?” 

“It’s a roughly square plastic 
container, bright yellow, about a 
foot thick. What about it?” 
Kayle’s voice sounded strained. 
“I’ve made inquiries. No one here 
seems to know the exact present 
location of the Master Tape. 
Each department says that they 
were under the impression that 
another handled the matter. I’m 
unable to learn who, precisely, 
removed the Tape from the 
vault. Now you say there is a 
yellow plastic container — ” 

“I know what the Master Tape 
looks like,” I said. “This is either 
it or a hell of a good copy.” 
“Granthan,” Kayle said. There 
was a note of desperation in his 
voice now. “There have been 
some blunders made. I knew you 
were under the influence of the 
Gool. It didn’t occur to me that 
I might be too. Why did I make 
it possible for you to successfully 
penetrate to the Central Vault? 
There were a hundred simpler 
ways in which I could have dealt 
with the problem. We’re in trou-

ble, Granthan, serious trouble. 
The tape you have there is gen- 
uine. We’ve all played into the 
enemy’s hands.” 

“You’re wasting valuable time, 
Kayle,” I snapped. “When does 
the bomb go up?” 

“Granthan, there’s little time 
left. Bring the Master Tape and 
leave the vault — ” 

“No dice, Kayle. I’m staying 
until I finish the transmitter, 
then — ” 

“Granthan! If there’s anything 
to your mad idea of such a 
machine, destroy it! Quickly! 
Don’t you see the Gool would 
only have given you the secret 
in order to enable you to steal 
the tape!” 

I cut him off. In the sudden 
silence, I heard a distant sound 
— or had I sensed a thought? I 
strained outward . 

“. volunteered . damn fool 
. thing on my head is heavy 
. better work . 

. now . okay . valve, 
gas . ■ kills in a split second 
. then get out . 

I stabbed out, pushed through 
the obscuring veil of masonry, 
sensed a man in the computer 
room, dressed in gray coveralls, 
a grotesque shield over his head 
and shoulders. He reached for a 
red-painted valve — 

I struck at his mind, felt him 
stagger back, fall. I fumbled in 
his brain, stimulated the sleep 



center. He sank deep into un- 
consciousness. I leaned against 
the table, weak with the reaction. 
Kayle had almost tricked me 
that time. 

I reached out again, swept the 
area with desperate urgency. 
Far away, I sensed the hazy 
clutter of many minds, out of 
range. There was nothing more. 
The poisonous gas had been the 
only threat — except the bomb 
itself. But I had to move fast, 
before my time ran out, to trans- 
mit the bomb to a desert area . 

I paused, stood frozen in mid- 
move. A desert. What desert? 

The transmitter operated in 
accordance with as rigid a set of 
laws as did the planets swinging 
in their orbits; strange laws, but 
laws of nature none the less. No 
receiver was required. The des- 
tination of the mass under trans. 
mission was determined by the 
operator, holding in his mind the 
five-dimensional conceptualiza- 
tion of the target, guiding the 
action of the machine. 

And I had no target. 

I could no more direct the 
bomb to a desert without a five- 
fold grasp of its multi-ordinal 
spatial, temporal, and entropic 
co-ordinates than I could fire 
a rifle at a target in the dark. 

I was like a man with a gre- 
nade in his hand, pin pulled — 
and locked in a cell.

I swept the exocosm again, 
desperately. And caught a thin, 
live line. I traced it; it cut 
through the mountain, dived 
deep underground, crossed the 
boundless plain . 

Never branching, it bored on, 
turning upward now — and end- 
ing. 

I rested, gathering strength, 
then probed, straining . 

There was a room, men. I 
recognized Kayle, gray-faced, 
haggard. A tall man in braided 
blue stood near him. Others stood 
silently by, tension on every face. 
Maps covered the wall behind 
them. 

I was looking into the War 
Room at the Pentagon in Wash- 
ington. The line I had traced was 
the telephonic hot-line, the top- 
security link between the Record 
Center and the command level. 
It was a heavy cable, well pro- 
tected and always open. It would 
free me from the trap. With Gool- 
tutored skill I scanned the room, 
memorized its co-ordinates. Then 
I withdrew. 

Like a swimmer coming up 
from a long dive, I fought my 
way back to the level of immedi- 
ate awareness. I sagged into a 
chair, blinking at the drab walls, 
the complexity of the transmitter. 
I must move fast now, place the 
bomb in the transmitter’s field, 
direct it at the target. With an 
effort I got to my feet, went to 



the sump, lifted the cover. I 
grasped the lifting eye, strained 

— and the bomb came up, out 
onto the floor. I dragged it to 
the transmitter ... 

And only then realized what 
I’d been about to do. 

My target. 

The War Room — the nerve- 
center of Earth’s defenses. And I 
had been ready to dump the hell 
bomb there. In my frenzy to be 
rid of it I would have played 
into the hands of the Gool. 

VII 

WENT to the phone. 

“Kayle! I guess you’ve got a 
recorder on the line. I’ll give you 
the details of the transmitter cir- 
cuits. It’s complicated, but fifteen 
minutes ought to — ” 

“No time,” Kayle cut in. “I’m 
sorry about everything, Grant- 
ham. If you’ve finished the ma- 
chine, it’s a tragedy for humanity 

— if it works. I can only ask you 
to try — when the Gool command 
comes — not to give them what 
they want. I’ll tell you, now, 
Grantham. The bomb blows in 
— ” there was a pause — “two 
minutes and twenty-one seconds. 
Try to hold them off. If you can 
stand against them for that long 
at least — ” 

I slammed the phone down, 
cold sweat popping out across my 
face. Two minutes . too late

for anything. The men in the 
War Room would never know 
how close I had come to beating 
the Gool — and them. 

But I could still save the Mas- 
ter Tape. I wrestled the yellow 
plastic case that housed the tape 
onto the table, into the machine. 

And the world vanished in a 
blaze of darkness, a clamor of 
silence. 

NOW, MASTERS! NOW! 
LINK UP! LINK UP! 

Like a bad dream coming back 
in daylight, I felt the obscene 
presence of massed Gool minds, 
attenuated by distance but ter- 
rible in their power, probing, 
thrusting. I fought back, strug- 
gling against paralysis, trying to 
gather my strength, use what I 
had learned . 

SEE, MASTERS, HOW IT 
WOULD ELUDE US. BLANK 
IT OFF, TOGETHER NOW . 

The paths closed before me. 
My mind writhed, twisted, darted 
here and there — and met only 
the impenetrable shield of the 
Gool defenses. 

IT TIRES, MASTERS. 
WORK SWIFTLY NOW. LET 
US IMPRESS ON THE SUB- 
JECT THE CO-ORDINATES 
OF THE BRAIN PIT. The con- 
ceptualization drifted into my 
mind. HERE, MAN. TRANS- 
MIT THE TAPE HERE! 

As from a distance,* the moni- 
tor personality fraction watched 



the struggle. Kayle had been 
right. The Gool had waited — 
and now their moment had come. 
Even my last impulse of defiance 
— to place the tape in the ma- 
chine — had been at the Gool 
command. They had looked into 
my mind. They understand 
psychology as no human analyst 
ever could; and they had led me 
in the most effective way pos- 
sible, by letting me believe I was 
the master. They had made use 
of my human ingenuity to carry 
out their wishes — and Kayle 
had made it easy for them by 
evacuating a twenty-mile radius 
around me, leaving the field clear 
for the Gool. 

HERE — The Gool voice 
rang like a bell in my mind: 
TRANSMIT THE TAPE 
HERE! 

Even as I fought against the 
impulse to comply, I felt my arm 
twitch toward the machine. 

THROW THE SWITCH! the 
voice thundered. 

I struggled, willed my arm to 
stay at my side. Only a minute 
longer, I thought. Only a minute 
more, and the bomb would save 
me . 

LINK UP, MASTERS! 

I WILL NOT LINK. YOU 
PLOT TO FEED AT MY EX- 
PENSE. 

NO! BY THE MOTHER 
WORM, I PLEDGE MY 
GROOVE AT THE EATING 



TROUGH. FOR US THE MAN 
WILL GUT THE GREAT 
VAULT OF HIS NEST 
WORLD! 

ALREADY YOU BLOAT AT 
OUR EXPENSE! 

FOOL! ! WOULD YOU 
BICKER NOW? LINK UP! 

PT'HE Gool raged — and I 
grasped for an elusive 
thought and held it. The bomb, 
only a few feet away. The wait- 
ing machine. And the Gool had 
given me the co-ordinates of 
their cavern . 

With infinite sluggishness, I 
moved. 

LINK UP, MASTERS: 
THEN ALL WILL FEED . 

IT IS A TRICK. I WILL NOT 
LINK. 

I found the bomb, fumbled for 
a grip. 

DISASTER, MASTERS! 
NOW IS THE PRIZE LOST 
TO US, UNLESS YOU JOIN 
WITH ME! 

My breath choked off in my 
throat; a hideous pain coiled out- 
ward from my chest. But it was 
unimportant. Only the bomb mat- 
tered. I tottered, groping. There 
was the table; the transmitter . 

I lifted the bomb, felt the half- 
healed skin of my burned arm 
crackle as I strained . 

I thrust the case containing 
the Master Tape out of the field 
of the transmitter, then pushed, 



half-rolled the bomb into posi- 
tion. I groped for the switch, 
found it. I tried to draw breath, 
felt only a surge of agony. Black- 
ness was closing in . 

The co-ordinates . 

From the whirling fog of pain 
and darkness, I brought the tar- 
get concept of the Gool cavern 
into view, clarified it, held it . 

MASTERS! HOLD THE 
MAN! DISASTER! 

Then I felt the Gool, their 
suspicions yielding to the panic 
in the mind of the Prime Over- 
lord, link their power against me. 
I stood paralyzed, felt my iden- 
tity dissolving like water pouring 
from a smashed pot. I tried to 
remember — but it was too faint, 
too far away. 

Then from somewhere a voice 
seemed to cut in, the calm voice 
of an emergency reserve person- 
ality fraction. “You are under 
attack. Activate the reserve plan. 
Level Five. Use Level Five. Act 
now. Use Level Five . 

Through the miasma of Gool 
pressure, I felt the hairs stiffen 
on the back of my neck. All 
around me the Gool voices raged, 
a swelling symphony of discord. 
But they were nothing. Level 
Five . 

There was no turning back. 
The compulsions were there, act- 
ing even as I drew in a breath to 
howl my terror — 

Level Five. Down past the 



130

131 



shapes of dreams, the intense 
faces of hallucination; Level 
Three; Level Four and the silent 
ranked memories . And deeper 
still — 

Into a region of looming gib- 
bering horror, of shadowy mov- 
ing shapes of evil, of dreaded 
presences that lurked at the edge 
of vision . 

Down amid the clamor of 
voiceless fears, the mounting 
hungers, the reaching claws of 
all that man had feared since the 
first tailless primate screamed 
out his terror in a tree-top: the 
fear of falling, the fear of heights. 

Down to Level Five. Night- 
mare level. 

[ groped outward, found the 
plane of contact — and hurled 
the weight of man’s ancient 
fears at the waiting Gool — and 
in their black confining caves 
deep in the rock of a far world, 
they felt the roaring tide of fear 
— fear of the dark, and of living 
burial. The horrors in man’s se- 
cret mind confronted the horrors 
of the Gool Brain Pit. And I felt 
them break, retreat in blind panic 
from me — 

All but one. The Prime Over- 
lord reeled back with the rest, 
but his was a mind of terrible 
power. I sensed for a moment his 
bloated immense form, the seeth- 
ing gnawing hungers, insatiable, 
never to be appeased. Then he 



rallied — but he was alone now. 

LINK UP, MASTERS! THE 
PRIZE IS LOST. KILL THE 
MAN! KILL THE MAN! 

I felt a knife at my heart. It 
fluttered — and stopped. And in 
that instant, I broke past his con- 
trol, threw the switch. There was 
the sharp crack of imploding air. 
Then I was floating down, ever 
down, and all sensation was far 
away. 

MASTERS! KILL TH 

The pain cut off in an instant 
of profound silence and utter 
dark. 

Then sound roared in my ears, 
and I felt the harsh grate of the 
floor against my face as I fell, 
and then I knew nothing more. 

4CT HOPE,” General Titus was 
saying, “that you’ll ac- 
cept the decoration now, Mr. 
Granthan. It will be th- first 
time in history that a civilian has 
been accorded this honor — and 
you deserve it.” 

I was lying in a clean white 
bed, propped up by big soft pil- 
lows, with a couple of good-look- 
ing nurses hovering a few feet 
away. I was in a mood to tolerate 
even Titus. 

“Thanks, General,” I said. “I 
suggest you give the medal to 
the volunteer who came in to gas 
me. He knew what he was going 
up against; I didn’t.” 

“It’s over, now, Granthan,’ 



132

Kayle said. He attempted to 
beam, settled for a frosty smile. 
“You surely understand — ” 
“Understanding,” I said. 
“That’s all we need to turn this 
planet — and a lot of other ones 
- — into the kind of worlds the 
human mind needs to expand 
into.” 

“You’re tired, Granthan,” 
Kayle said. “You get some rest. 
In a few weeks you’ll be back on 
the job, as good as new.” 

“That’s where the key is,” I 
said. “In our minds; there’s so 
much there, and we haven’t even 
scratched the surface. To the 
mind nothing is impossible. Mat- 
ter is an illusion, space and time 
are just convenient fictions — ” 
“I’ll leave the medal here, Mr. 
Granthan. When you feel equal 
to it, we’ll make the official pre- 
sentation. Television . 

He faded off as I closed my 
eyes and thought about things 
that had been clamoring for at- 
tention ever since I’d met the 
Gool, but hadn’t had time to ex- 
plore. My arm . 

I felt my way along it — from 
inside — tracing the area of 
damage, watching as the bodily 
defenses worked away, toiling to 
renew, replace. It was a slow, 
mindless process. But if I helped 
a little . 

It was easy. The pattern was 
there. I felt the tissues renew 
themselves, the skin regenerate. 



The bone was more difficult. 
I searched out the necessary min- 
erals, diverted blood; the broken 
ends knit . 

The nurse was bending over 
me, a bowl of soup in her hand. 

44V7"OU’VE been asleep for a 
long time, sir,” she said, 
smiling. “How about some nice 
chicken broth now?” 

I ate the soup and asked for 
more. A doctor came and peeled 
back my bandages, did a double- 
take, and rushed away. I looked. 
The skin was new and pink, like 
a baby’s — but it was all there. I 
flexed my right leg; there was 
no twinge of pain. 

I listened for a while as the 
doctors gabbled, clucked, probed 
and made pronouncements. Then 
I closed my eyes again. I thought 
about the matter transmitter. 
The government was sitting on 
it, of course. A military secret of 
the greatest importance, Titus 
called it. Maybe someday the 
public would hear about it; in 
the meantime — 

“How about letting me out of 
here?” I said suddenly. A pop- 
eyed doctor with a fringe of gray 
hair blinked at me, went back 
to fingering my arm. Kayle hove 
into view. 

“I want out,” I said. “I’m re- 
covered, right? So now just give 
me my clothes.” 

“Now, now, just relax, Grant-

han. You know it’s not as simple 
as that. There are a lot of matters 
we must go over.” 

“The war’s over,” I said. “You 
admitted that. I want out.” 

“Sorry.” Kayle shook his head. 
“That’s out of the question.” 
“Doc,” I said. “Am I well?” 
“Yes,” he said. “Amazing case. 
You’re as fit as you’ll ever be; 
I’ve never — ” 

“I’m afraid you’ll have to re- 
sign yourself to being here for a 
while longer, Granthan,” Kayle 
said. “After all, we can’t — ” 
“Can’t let the secret of matter 
transmission run around loose, 
hey? So until you figure out the 
angles, I’m a prisoner, right?” 

“I’d hardly call it that, Grant- 
han. Still . 

I closed my eyes. The matter 
transmitter — a strange device. 
A field, not distorting space, but 
accentuating certain character- 
istics of a matter field in space- 
time, subtly shifting relation- 
ships . 

Just as the mind could com- 
pare unrelated data, draw from 
them new concepts, new paral- 
lels . 

The circuits of the matter 



transmitter . and the patterns 
of the mind . 

The exocosm and the endo- 
cosm, like the skin and the 
orange, everywhere in contact . 

Somewhere there was a beach 
of white sand, and dunes with 
graceful sea-oats that leaned in 
a gentle wind. There was blue 
water to the far horizon, and a 
blue sky, and nowhere were 
there any generals with medals 
and television cameras, or flint- 
eyed bureaucrats with long 
schemes . 

And with this gentle folding 
. thus . 

And a pressure here . so . 

I opened my eyes, raised my- 
self on one elbow — and saw the 
sea. The sun was hot on my 
body, but not too hot, and the 
sand was white as sugar. Far 
away, a seagull tilted, circling. 

A wave rolled in, washed my 
foot in cool water. 

I lay on my back, and looked 
up at white clouds in a blue sky, 
and smiled — then laughed 
aloud. 

Distantly the seagull’s cry 

echoed my laughter.

5 Star Shelf 



AT THE EARTH’S CORE by 
Edgar Rice Burroughs. Ace 
Books. 

ALTHOUGH JULES Verne 
wrote the most famous and most 
enduring story about a hollow 
earth, he didn’t hold a patent on 
this valuable hunk of real estate. 
Author Burroughs staked out his 
claim in this rip-snorting adven- 
ture set “At the Earth’s Core”. 

The entire adventure is strictly 
from accident. An aged inventor 
and his wealthy young backer 
seek merely to test out the inven- 
tion, a mechanical mole that 



passes loose rock from the drill 
at the nose through a hollow dou- 
ble skin to the stern. 

Pellucidar, as Burroughs named 
his interior world, is the inverse 
image of the exterior in the mat- 
ter of land and water distribution. 
Thus the total land area of this 
world within a world comes to 
124 million square miles, com- 
pared to the surface’s mere 53 
million. As Burroughs puts it, 
“We have the strange anomaly of 
a larger world within a smaller 
one!” 

Pellucidar’s perpetual noon is 



★ ★★★★ SHELF 



135 





lighted by a tiny sun, suspended 
at the exact center of Earth’s 
sphere. Burroughs polishes off the 
problem of gravitational attrac- 
tion by placing the center of 
gravity midway through the 500 
mile thick crust separating Pellu- 
cidar from the surface. 

The inner world, having cooled 
later, is much younger than ours, 
making for a hodge-podge ecol- 
ogy. Burroughs has much fun mix- 
ing perils of Pliocene, Pleistocene 
and Pauline. 

Mankind, two separate species, 
is subservient to the dominant 
race, rhamphorhynchus-like crea- 
race, rhamphorhynchuslike crea- 
tures, deaf, but able to communi- 
cate, not by telepathy, but “by 
projecting their thoughts into the 
fourth dimension, when they be- 
come appreciable to the sixth 
sense of the listener.” All are fe- 
males, having discovered how to 
reproduce without male assist- 
ance. They are highly civilized, 
philosophical creatures who con- 
sider Man a lower order and 
debate pro and con his ability to 
reason, meanwhile employing him 
as slave, and clandestinely as 
food. Burroughs incorporates a 
ritual feeding scene that is a spell- 
binder of pure horror. 

In his world of eternal noon, 
duration is strictly relative and 
Time as we measure it does not 
exist. Even the dominant race 
takes no account of it, their liter- 



ary works employing only the 
present tense. 

There are holes as big as Pellu- 
cidar itself in his theories, but Bur- 
roughs’s concepts are intriguing 
and his combat scenes gripping. 
Although the reader must wade 
at least twenty-five pages into the 
book before he can cease to be an- 
noyed by the author’s stilted and 
florid style, by then he has 
reached the point of no return. 

THE MOON MAID by Edgar 
Rice Burroughs. Ace Books. 
THERE ARE many proverbs 
that boil down to, “If you’ve got 
hold of a good thing, milk it to 
death.” Burroughs’s hollow sphere 
Earth seemed so good to him 
that he applied it to the Moon, 
also. 

His story begins in 1967 aboard 
a giant Chicago to Paris airliner 
that races along a thousand feet 
above the surface and is moti- 
vated by wireless energy from 
power plants thousands of miles 
distant. 

The narrator, ancestor of the 
actual protagonist, owes his mem- 
ory of subsequent events to total 
recollection of several reincar- 
nated existences. This simple lit- 
erary device eliminates the need 
for such a crudity as a time ma- 
chine and obviously opens the 
way for sequel after sequel. 

The descendent of the narra- 
tor, 100 years in the future, is the 



136 



GALAXY 



leader of a five man expedition to 
Mars, made possible by radio ex- 
change of information with the 
Martians who have isolated the 
Eighth Barsoomian (Martian) 
Ray, along with the Eighth Rays 
of the other planets. This is also 
a literary rather than a scientific 
device, like the Cavorite of H. G. 
Wells’s moon explorers, that might 
be called an enabling device, since 
without it there’s no story and 
with it there’s no explanation. 

The ship’s engines are sabo- 
taged by their inventor, the dis- 
gruntled second-in-command and 
is stranded on, or rather in, the 
moon. Its crust is riddled by 
thousands of craters that serve to 
supply both light and heat to the 
interior, although the primary 
source of light is the high radium 
content of the soil. 

Julian 5th, separated early 
from his companions, is not re- 
united with them until after sev- 
eral captures by and escapes from 
primitive humanoid quadrupeds 
and/or semi-civilized humans.

PELLUCIDAR by Edgar Rice 
Burroughs. Ace Books. 

IN THIS sequel to “At the 
Earth’s Core,” Burroughs chroni- 
cles the search of David Innes for 
his Stone Age mate, Dian. He has 
returned frdm the surface in the 
steel mole loaded with books and 
materials to further his plans to 
purge Pellucidar of the intelligent 



reptiles and create a human civili- 
zation based on the best of twen- 
tieth century technology, with 
himself as benevolently dictatori- 
al emperor. 

Most of Burroughs’s theories 
make for hard swallowing. The 
horizonless inner world dimin- 
ishes upward into an indefinable 
dim distance. This I’d like to see, 
as well as his pendent world, 
hanging only a mile above the 
inner surface with its axis parallel 
to the surface. All its plains and 
forests, lakes and rivers become 
visible as it rotates, providing a 
clock for a world that otherwise 
has no way of determining time. 
One suspects that Burroughs 
planted it there like a big seed 
that was to germinate eventually 
in another sequel. 

But, argue as one might with 
his scientific theories, once Bur- 
roughs establishes his background, 
his reader has no time to quibble. 

THE MOON MEN by Edgar 
Rice Burroughs. Ace Books. 
THIS SEQUEL to “The Moon 
Maid” actually comprises two 
novels; “The Moon Men,” which 
is the story of Julian 9th in the 
22 nd Century and “The Red 
Hawk,” about Julian 20th in the 
25th Century. 

The renegade villain of “Moon 
Maid”, Orthis, is killed by Julian 
5th, but not until he assembles 
a horde of semi-savages from the

Moon who conquer and lay Earth 
waste. 

“The Moon Men” is the ac- 
count of Julian 9th’s solitary, 
hopeless struggle against the Kal- 
kar conquerors and the complete 
collapse of civilization. 

In “The Red Hawk”, the pas- 
sage of centuries has seen the Kal- 
kars pushed back to the seacoast. 
The Hawk, Julian 20th, mounts 
the final offensive designed to 
push them into the sea. 

THUVIA, MAID OF MARS by 
Edgar Rice Burroughs. Ace 
Books. 

AT THIS point even the most 
neophytic of readers must be 
aware that this is the fabled 
Burroughs of yore whose books 
were translated into some forty 
languages and sold an equal num- 
ber of million copies. Yet an en- 
tire generation has grown up in- 
explicably Burroughs-less. The 
great majority of his books have 
been out of print for a score of 
years, the only reminder of his 
former glory is the release of an 
occasional laughable Tarzan film. 

Burroughs antedated van Vogt’s 
vision of a contradictory civiliza- 
tion, half barbaric, half technolog- 
ically advanced, by some three 
decades. In the first three novels 
of the series, John Carter of Vir- 
ginia settles just about all the 
major problems besetting wartorn 
Mars. His son, Carthoris, is the 



hero of “Thuvia” and the action 
arises from his supposed aerial 
abduction of Thuvia. 

By modern standards, Bur- 
roughs’s science is pretty rudi- 
mentary, viz. the interplanetary 
ether, Eighth Rays, Hollow plan- 
ets, etc. Bear in mind, however, 
that he wrote when many homes 
still used gas for lighting; sound 
pictures hadn’t been invented, to 
say nothing of TV; aircraft were 
slow, clumsy crudities. In fact, 
Burroughs’s airships really were 
ships of the air, with polished 
decks, rails, below-deck cabins 
and a top speed of a lumbering 
two hundred miles per hour. 

“Thuvia” is full of abductions, 
captures, escapes and recaptures 
in the best Burroughs tradition 
and it has something else for 
the devoted Burroughsiphile; the 
fondly remembered “giant bow- 
men of Lothar,” materialized from 
Barsoom’s dead past by the hand- 
ful of Lothar’s living defenders. 

Ratings? Let’s not try. It’s hard 
to evaluate them in terms of 
today. I’m afraid that, like so 
many others, my boyhood was 
too entangled with the Burroughs 
books for me to be objective. 
Frankly, even though I hadn’t 
read any of his books for well 
over twenty years, these past 
weeks have been Ol’ Nostalgia 
Month for me. The old boy has 
the power to send me still!

JESS STEARN, newspaperman and best- 
selling author, is a man with a passion for 
facts. He started out a confirmed skeptic — 
certain that reports of clairvoyance and ESP 
were based on coincidence and fraud. 

But he discovered he was wrong! He met 
Jeane Dixon, whom Franklin D. Roosevelt in- 
vited to the White House to predict how much 
time he had to finish his work - which she 
did correctly. Then, from Virginia Beach, 
came first-hand evidence about the fantastic 
feats of Edgar Cayce. And then came Peter 
Hurkos, who sensed past, present and future, 
as he broke two murder cases that had baf- 
fled police. Newspaperman Stearn could draw 
only one inescapable conclusion. The future 
can be foreseen. There is a “door to the 
future!" 

One of the most important revelations 
of our time 

THE DOOR TO THE FUTURE offers irrefutable 
proof of psychic power, and shows how we 
may be on the verge of a scientific break- 
through in psychic science. 

It tells — 

• how a man’s life was saved when his wife 
foresaw a plane crash; 

• how Universal Consciousness reveals past 
and future; 



The documented facts 
behind a 
prize-winning 
reporter’s 
shattering discovery 
of the truth about 
ESP. prophecy 
and precognition 



TO THE 





• how the evidence for precognition sup- 
ports reincarnation and survival; 

• how the Odic force reveals itself to psy- 
chic sensitives; 

• how you may discover psychic powers 
within yourself! 

Jess Stearn obtained the cooperation of psy- 
chics everywhere in America — men and 
women who cooperated fully because they 
knew- intuitively — that his report would 
itself be an important breakthrough. That’s 
why this is the one book that is convincing 
non-believers everywhere — a record by an 
admitted cynic who learned that the door to 
the future is being opened wider every day 
by gifted psychics and mediums. It is defi- 
nitely a book which you must read and own.

64 T SUPPOSE you think of it 
sometimes,” sighed Lucy 
Parent, as their Mordaunti space- 
ship descended on the world that 
was its midway stop to the Mor- 
daunti capital world of Cayahno. 
Cayahno was something like six 
hundred light years in toward the 
center of the galaxy from Earth. 
The Mordaunti Ambassador, Ar- 



knok, had explained it would be 
necessary to let down here at 
Bug’raf to replate the drive 
chamber. 

“Think of what?” said Tom 
Parent. He was pacing up and 
down by their stateroom viewer. 
He alternated between casting 
glances at the glittering cityport 
toward which they were descend- 
ing and glancing at the top-secret 
subspace communication that had

just reached him from his superi- 
ors back on Earth. The commu- 
nication was, of course, in code. 
But Tom had had the keys to all 
recent codes hypnoed into him 
before they left Earth. 

Lucy sighed again. “About 
what it’d be like not being mar- 
ried, again.” 

“Not married? What?” said 
Tom, stopping his pacing sudden- 
ly. “Why, of course not. Certainly 



not. What made you think of 
that?” 

“Oh, nothing,” sighed Lucy. 

“If you don’t mind,” said Tom, 
“I have something urgent on my 
mind at the moment.” 

“All men do,” said Lucy, study- 
ing her fingernails. “I suppose it’s 
only natural. Women aren’t like 
that. Marriage means a lot to a 
woman.” 

“Lucy, if you don’t mind — ”

Tom was suddenly interrupted by 
the gentle chiming of their state- 
room door. “Come in.” 

The door opened. A seven-foot 
humanoid looking like a satanic 
Tarzan in purple robes stepped 
into the room. A weapons harness 
covered the robes, various types 
of weapons depending from it. 
The humanoid touched pale green 
fingers to his winged skullcap. 

“Good morning, Mr. Ambassa- 
dor,” said Tom, touching his own 
brown crew-cut in similar fash- 
ion. “May the Mordaunti live for- 
ever.” 

“And yourrr own rrrace also,” 
replied the Ambassador, rolling 
his r’s like a Scotsman. His black 
eyes glittered as he added affa- 
bly, “I thocht I’d tell you therrres 
time for you to stroll about the 
Bug’raf capital below, if you wish. 
We’ll be here at least half a day.” 

“Stroll? Well! Well, that’s just 
fine!” cried Tom, happily. “Yes. 
We will. Thank you so much, Mr. 
Ambassador.” 

“Think nothing of it,” replied 
the other. Touching his head 
again, he went out. 

“You go by yourself,” said 
Lucy sadly. “I think I’ll just stay 
here.” 

“You will not!” Tom snapped. 
Lucy sat up and stared at him. 

H ALF AN HOUR later the ship 
was down, and Tom and 
Lucy strolled off the landing area 



into the winding, colorful streets 
that looked as if they had been 
lifted out of the illustrations of 
some old fairy-tale book. The 
streets were as warm with a hun- 
dred alien races. Once out of sight 
of the ship, Tom started walking 
at a pace that had Lucy almost 
trotting to keep up. 

“Tom!” She grabbed hold of his 
arm. “Slow down! I can’t — ” 

“Just around this corner,” said 
Tom, dragging her around it and 
down at seats of something like a 
sidewalk cafe. A robot rolled up. 
“Alcohol and cold distilled water, 
two,” he said in the local lingua 
franca. -The robot rolled away. “I 
couldn’t talk on the ship. Some- 
thing’s come up.” 

“But you’re on vacation!” cried 
Lucy. “This is supposed to be our 
second honeymoon!” She broke 
off suddenly and eyed him sharp- 
ly. The robot rolled up and de- 
posited two squeeze-bulbs before 
them. Tom produced his identity 
papers with the Mordaunti seal. 
The robot punched a hole in 
them and went away. 

“Well — ” said Tom. 

“Or is it?” 

“Well,” said Tom, avoiding her 
eye. 

“You told me — you told me 
this was a vacation! I might have 
known there was something 
wrong the way you’ve been act- 
ing. So. ... So absentminded 
about things. Well,” said Lucy, 



142

“it doesn’t matter, of course. I 
don’t mind. Go right ahead.” She 
fumbled angrily in her wristpurse 
and produced a small lace hand- 
kerchief. 

“Good!” whispered Tom. Lucy 
checked herself, surprised, with 
the handkerchief half-raised. 

“Good?” 

“We’re away from the ship but 
there still may be spies. That’ll 
confuse them. Look, Lucy, I didn’t 
know about this myself until I got 
the sub-space message just now. 
The Office Upstairs back on 
Earth just said they might have a 
little job for me on Cayahno. 
They didn’t even let me in on it 
— after all, I’m still only a First 
Assistant Secretary in the For- 
eign Office’s Department of New 
Governments.” 

“You let me think it was going 
to be a real vacation!” 

“Now, honey, be reasonable.” 

“I won’t!” 

“Our lives are in danger.” 

“Oh!” Lucy closed the mouth 
she had just opened preparatory 
to saying some more, looked 
around and put the handkerchief 
away. She leaned toward Tom. 
“In danger?” she whispered. 

“That’s what I’ve been trying 
to tell you,” said Tom in a low 
voice, “and it’s not my fault. The 
Office Upstairs just gave me the 
idea they wanted me to do some 
little red-tape thing, like make a 
duty call on one of the Mordaunti 




authorities. Now, this message 
lets me in on it. And it’s so secret 
they couldn’t even trust me with 
the knowledge before we left.” 
“Tell me,” said Lucy. 

“I’m not supposed to — ” 

“Oh!” gasped Lucy. “It’s all 
right if my life is in danger; but 
I’m not supposed to know why!” 
“—But,” said Tom, “as I was 
going to say if you’d ever let me 
finish saying something, I’m going 
to. You may have to carry on if 
anything happens to me.” 

“Tom!” Lucy’s eyes grew sud- 
denly large. 

tilVTO USE not facing things,” 
' said Tom bravely. “Well, 
here it is. On Cayahno — the capi- 
tal world of the Mordaunti to 



THE FAITHFUL WILF

which we’re headed — there’s go- 
ing to be a gathering of repre- 
sentatives from the forty-three 
great interstellar powers in this 
section of the galaxy.” 

“Forty-three?” squeaked Lucy. 
“The Oprinkians, the Mordaunti, 
us — and who else?” 

Tom, said sadly, “We are not 
listed among the forty-three. The 
Jaktals were, of course. And 
everyone knows we’ve taken over 
their empire* by now. But no in- 
vitation has been sent to us.” 
“Why, that’s terrible!” 

“More than terrible. Danger- 
ous. It means the other forty-two 
great interstellar empires are 
thinking of dividing our own and 
the Jaktal territory between 
them. The Oprinkians** are still 
our friends, of course. They sug- 
gested we secretly send a man 
and have him just walk in and 
take over the Jaktal chair at the 
meeting.” 

“You?” said Lucy. 

“Me,” said Tom. “The Office 
Upstairs thought a minor official 
like myself would never be sus- 
pected of being sent to speak for 
the whole human empire. Of 
course, I won’t actually speak for 
us. I’ll simply grab the Jaktal seat 
and hold it. Once I’m there, I’m 
safe. No one will act against me 
for fear of endangering his own 
immunity as Ambassador. But 
I’ve got to get there first.” 

“Let’s go back to the ship and 



lock ourselves in and throw away 
the key.” 

“That might not be a bad idea. 
However — ” Tom broke off sud- 
denly and looked up. A sudden 
hush had fallen over the street. 
Everyone seemed to have disap- 
peared. Then, suddenly, around 
the corner floated a metal plat- 
form with two odd-looking aliens 
of different species on it. 

II 

T HE FIRST was a stubby in- 
dividual wearing a harness 
draped with guns, knives and 
other fierce gadgets. He wore 
nothing else. He appeared com- 
pletely hairless, his skin a lea- 
thery brown. His face looked 
something like a bulldog’s. The 
other alien beside him was about 
three feet tall, wearing a robe, a 
sort of magician’s cone-shaped 
hat and a long white beard, above 
which showed a bulbous nose and 
two large, purple trusting eyes. 

“Greetings!” boomed the har- 
nessed individual, in the local lin- 
gua franca, bringing the platform 
to a halt at their table. As it set- 
tled to the ground he took a de- 
vice from his harness and looked 
through it at Tom. “Magnificent! 
Just as advertised! .72 on the fe-

rocity scale. Congratulations, my 
boy. I am Drakvil, Master Assas- 
sin — and you are my apprentice.” 

“Apprentice?” said Tom. 

“Hard to believe, I know. But 
you are. I just picked you.” 

“Pardon me,” said Tom. “But 
overwhelming as the honor is . .” 

“Tut-tut,” said Drakvil. “Say 
no more.” 

“ — I must decline — ” 

“WHAT?” 

Drakvil suddenly paled all 
over his body until he was almost 
white. Gradually his color came 
back. He slowly extended a hand 
and pointed at Lucy. 

“So,” he said. “I think I see. 
Does that wilf belong to you?” 

“I certainly do!” said Lucy. 

Drakvil’s arm dropped. 

“Wilf-ridden!” he breathed. “I 
get an apprentice with one of the 
finest aptitude ratings ever re- 
corded; and it has a wilf! But 
don’t worry, my boy.” He got 
down and began to rummage in- 
side the back edge of the plat- 
form. “I’ll free you.” 

“Tom!” said Lucy, clutching his 
arm. 

“Shh,” hissed Tom. “It’s all 
right—” 

He was interrupted as the sec- 
ond alien on the platform sudden- 
ly begin to cry in a timid, despair- 
ing fashion. 

“What’s wrong with you?” said 
Tom, turning on it. 

“Oh, sir,” sobbed the smaller 



alien. “It would’ve been such an 
honor for a simple pjenik pjanik 
like me. No real Assassin would 
lower himself to slay a pjanik 
under the pjonik class. Of course 
I know your honor’s still only an 
apprentice and it’d only be a 
practice assassination, but — ” 

“Wait a minute,” said Tom. 

The pjanik wiped its eyes with 
its white beard and sniffed. 

“You mean,” said Tom. “I’m 
supposed to practice assassinat- 
ing on you?” 

46r\F COURSE,” snapped 
Drakvil, coming up with a 
metal plate tucked under one 
arm. “Begin with live targets right 
away. The only way. I’ve got no 
patience with Master Assassins 
that start their apprentices out on 
simulacrums. No meat. No feel to 
it.” He unhooked one of the gadg- 
ets from his harness. “Here,” he 
said, “you can borrow my loset.” 
He shoved it into Tom’s hand. 
“Meanwhile, I will psychoanalyze 
you and rid you of this wilfish 
affliction.” 

“You don’t understand, I’m 
afraid, sir Assassin,” said Tom in 
smooth, diplomatic tones. “I’m 
just ashore for a few hours from 
the Mordaunti ship at the space- 
port.” 

Drakvil shook his head. “Tut- 
tut, delusions as well. Not sur- 
prising, I suppose. My lad, the 
Mordaunti ship took off just five 



THE FAITHFUL WILF 



145 



minutes ago and, as you see, you 
are still here.” 

“Took off? But it had to have 
its drive chamber replated!” 
“Come, come,” said Drakvil. 
“To replate a drive chamber takes 
days. The ship needs to be com- 
pletely torn down — that’s one 
reason we Assassins never use 
ships. To work, my boy. There’s 
your pjanik, and you have the 
loset in hand.” He glanced at the 
metal plate. “Meanwhile — let me 
see — I have some questions here. 
When you were an immature life 
form did you ever secretly like 
your primary immediate male an- 
cestor?” 

Tom was exchanging glances 
with Lucy. He winked and whis- 
pered in English, “Play along.” He 
handed the loset back to the 
Master Assassin, bowing. 

“Ordinarily,” he said, “I’d be 
happy to assassinate this little fel- 
low here — ” He put his hand on 
the shoulder of the pjanik. 

“Oh!” cried the pjanik in sud- 
den accents of joy. “It touched 
me! Its honor touched me!” It fell 
at Tom’s feet and began kissing 
the toes of Tom’s shoes. “Oh, 
thank you, your nobleship, your 
kindnessness, little uncle.” 

Drakvil had gone suddenly 
white again. Now he faded back 
to his normal color and boomed 
with laughter. 

“All right, you young rascal!” 
he said. “Caught me fairly that 



time. Takes some nerve to risk 
distracting a Master Assassin 
long enough to touch a piece of 
his property and adopt it. Well, 
you got away with it. Now, all 
that talk about the Mordaunti 
spaceship. Eyewash, right? You 
deliberately got off here to put 
yourself in a position where I 
could see you and take you on as 
an Apprentice, didn’t you?” 

“Er, yes,” said Tom. 

“Yes?” cried Lucy. 

“Playalong, playalong, we’re- 
stranded - here - without - that - 
ship,” muttered Tom between his 
teeth in English, smiling brightly 
at Drakvil. 

‘Well, come along then,” said 
Drakvil, remounting the platform. 
“Bring your newly adopted neph- 
ew-slave along with you. Does 
the wilf have to come, too?” 

“Just try to go without me!” 
said Lucy. 

“Blasted faithful wilfs!” mut- 
tered Drakvil, as Tom stepped up 
on the platform and helped Lucy 
up behind him. “Sap the back- 
bone out of a being. Wouldn’t 
have one myself for . Hang on, 
here we go, across the galaxy to 
Pjo.” 

e?T>JO?” said Tom. But al- 
ready the city around them 
had vanished. The platform was 
now sitting in the midst of a fea- 
tureless waste of sand, with what 
looked like a temple far off on the 



146 



GALAXY 



horizon. “Well,” Tom said, blink- 
ing a little, “that’s some transpor- 
tation.” 

“The only way to go,” said 
Drakvil with satisfaction. “Why 
travel by slow phase-shifting 
when this is available? Of course 
there’s always that statistical 
chance of coming out in the cen- 




jbrcL-i! 



ter of some sun or other. But 
death is an Assassin’s constant 
companion, anyway. Let’s get 
down to business.” 

He pointed at the distant tem- 
ple-like building. 

“Scene of your first assignment. 
First I’d better brief you.” He 
reached down and touched some- 
thing on the platform at his feet. 
A golden light flickered suddenly 
around Tom, who went down like 



a pjanik shot by a loset, in a 
crumpled heap. 

“Tom!” cried Lucy frantically, 
kneeling by him. He sat up grog- 
gily and shook his head. “Who? 
What? Where — oh, hello, wilf.” 
“Wilf!” cried Lucy. “Tom, don’t 
you know me?” 

“Of course I know you, wilf — 
I mean, honey. Help me up.” 
Lucy helped him to his feet. 
Tom shook his head a few more 
times. 

“Bit of a shock, acquiring all 
that information at once. I’m all 
right wi — Lucy. Oh, is that my 
harness?” He reached out and 
took the cluster of weapons Drak- 
vil was holding out to him. He 
put it on, checking its gadgets. 
“Let’s see. Spengs. Losets. Oh, and 
a gornul. Latest model, I see.” 
“Naturally,” said Drakvil. “The 
workman is worthy of his tools.” 
“Thanks.” Tom looked off at 
the building. “Subject in there?” 
“Tom!” said Lucy, “what’re you 
going to do?” 

Tom ignored her and went on 
talking to Drakvil. “Large estab- 
lishment, I take it?” 

“A spranjik of the gark class,” 
said Drakvil. 

“Probably has a gnruth of jilks 
for guard?” 

“Two gnruths. All porbornik- 
jilks.” 

“Tom!” cried Lucy. “You an- 
swer me! What’re you going to 
do? What are gnruths?” 



THE FAITHFUL WILF 



147 




“Bodyguard units of fifty jilks 
apiece,” said Tom absently, star- 
ing at the building. 

“Tom, you aren’t thinking of 
trying to assassinate someone 
who has a hundred bodyguards?” 

“You’ll notice,” said Drakvil to 
Tom, “the establishment is laid 
out for alnrits, both inside and 
out.” 

Tom laughed scornfully. “Al- 
nrits!” 

“Tom! What are alnrits? Will 
you pay some attention to me? 

“They’re disintegrators,” said 
Tom without looking around. 
“Don’t bother me now, wilf.” 

Lucy shouted, “I am not, not, 
not a wilf!” 

“Well, I’m off,” said Tom. He 
reached down to do something to 
the platform, and disappeared. 

“Tom!” wailed Lucy. 

H E reappeared again, shoving 
one of the larger gadgets 
back into his holster on the weap- 
ons harness. 

“Well, that was easy enough,” 
he said. Lucy gaped at him. 

“Tom, you didn’t — ” she 
gasped. 

“Not yet,” said Tom cheerfully. 
“I just went in for a reconnoitre. 
On accelerated time.” 

“Report what you did, Assist- 
ant,” Drakvil said. 

“Oh, I approached the gate and 
spenged one of jilks on outer 
guard there. When the rest turned 



to see what had happened, I 
slipped in. As I expected, I found 
myself in a mobius maze of corri- 
dors. I calculated my way 
through, spenged the three jilks I 
found at the inner entrance, and 
took cover when the alarm sound- 
ed and a platoon came up at the 
double with pobornik guns at the 
ready.” 

“Did they suspect an Assassin 
was inside the gark?” asked Drak- 
vil. 

“No sir,” answered Tom. “I 
overheard them guessing that it 
was a dispossessed simulacrum — 
a rogue lone. I ducked down a 
side street of the jilk quarters and 
found my way blocked by a full- 
armed tank. Well, of course a 
monstrosity like that could never 
be knocked out by a mere speng. 

I knew that.” 

“What — what did you do?” 
Lucy asked. 

“Oh, I just stood still in the 
center of the street the way any 
ordinary dispossessed, mindless 
rogue simulacrum might. And 
when they were close enough, I 
gave the tank a pung from my 
class two loset.” 

Drakvil beamed. “Very good. 
And then?” 

“I took the tank and drove it 
through the inner defenses as if 
I was the tank crew coming back 
off duty. Inside, I abandoned the 
tank and slipped into the ruler’s 
personal family section of the 



148 



GALAXY 



gark. I set up a resolving point 
inside so the platform could be 
brought in, and came back to get 
the three of you.” 

The pjanik squeaked with 
pleasure. 

“Me, too? Oh, little uncle!” 
“Yes,” said Tom, giving Lucy a 
strange, meaningful glance that 
baffled her completely, “particu- 
larly you too.” 

“You wanted me to see you in 
action. Very good,” said Drakvil. 
He reached down and touched 
the platform, and they were all 
suddenly in a curtained alcove, 
dim-lit from above. “Now what?” 
“You can watch through the 
curtain,” said Tom. “Now, I’m go- 
ing to disguise myself and take 
on the nartled appearance of an 
illegal gossip-seller.” He reached 
down and touched the platform. 
Lucy gave a small, stifled shriek. 

“It’s still me,” creaked the 
clawed and warty creature now 
standing before them. “Watch 
through the curtain.” 

Ill 

TTE SLIPPED off the platform, 
parted the curtains and slid 
through. Lucy, Drakvil and the 
pjanik hurried to the parting and 
peered through. They saw a lofty 
hall with a guard of armed jilks, 
their eye-stalks stiff at attention. 
A jilk officer was pacing up and 
down. Tom, in his gossip-seller’s 

THE FAITHFUL WILF 



guise, sidled up to the officer. 

“Juicy items,” Lucy heard him 
whine, “rare tidbits from strange 
worlds — ” 

The officer backed away dis- 
tastefully and snapped, “Filthy 
creature! Keep your nartled 
claws to yourself.” 

“But commander! I must go in- 
side the door. A certain female of 
the ranking family — your fresh- 
ness understands — ” 

“Your pass!” snapped the offi- 
cer, extending a three-fingered 
hand. 

“But she gave me no pass,” 
Tom whimpered. “She simply 
said to come to this entrance — ” 
He sidled closer. “Your freshness 
would not want me to compro- 
mise the good name of one of the 
inner gark by mentioning it in 
public? But if I could talk to you 
aside — ” 

“Stand back,” said the officer. 
“Very well.” He let Tom lead him 
away from the guard. To Lucy’s 
horror they approached the al- 
cove, stopping just outside the 
curtain. 

“Now,” said the officer in a low, 
eager voice. Lucy was amazed to 
see his eyestalks wavering drunk- 
enly. He panted. “I know you’re 
lying. The female Orbash is the 
only one who could have called 
yoil, and she is elsewhere. So tell 
me! What have you got to sell?” 

Tom whispered, “I knew your 
freshness was an addict, the mo- 



149 




lie C Pjeni!t 9 ^ \anib 



ment I saw the angle of your eye- 
stalks! It’ll cost you.” 

“I am not an addict,” panted 
the officer. “I like a little gossip 
like the next being, but I can take 
it or leave it alone. But price is 
no object. Quick, what’ve you got 
for sale?” 

“Bend down, listen — ” said 
Tom. The eyestalks dipped in- 
ward. Tom threw a sudden hook 
to the officer’s midsection. The 
officer collapsed without a sound 
and Tom shoved him through the 
curtain at Lucy’s feet, meanwhile 
immediately turning his appear- 
ance into a duplicate of the offi- 
cer’s. He marched across to the 
guard. 

“Attention!” he snapped. “Right 
face! Forward march.” They 



marched off down the corridor. 

“Magnificent discipline these 
pobornik-jilks have,” remarked 
Drakvil, as Tom, marching be- 
hind the guard, stepped back into 
the alcove. “However, it some- 
times works ■ to their disadvan- 
tage.” 

“I assumed so,” said Tom, re- 
suming his natural appearance, 
much to Lucy’s relief. “Now, shall 
we enter the gark-ruler’s inner 
sanctum?” 

H E LED them to the unde- 
fended door and opened it. 
They stepped through filmy hang- 
ing curtains to find themselves in 
a pleasant, sunlit room where a 
fountain played. A pjanik in pur- 
ple robes turned to look at them. 
Tom's adopted nephew-slave im- 
mediately prostrated himself be- 
fore his duplicate. 

“Rise, inferior,” said the one in 
the purple robe. He helped Tom’s 
pjanik to arise, and the two stood 
nose to nose, their white beards 
almost touching, their gentle eyes 
fastened in friendly fashion on 
each other. “To what do I owe the 
honor of this visit?” 

“Rejoice, noble sir,” said Tom’s 
pjanik. “You are about to be as- 
sassinated.” 

“Hardly a cause for rejoicing, 
inferior,” the other protested 
mildly. 

“It isn’t, noble sir?” 

“Not for a pjonik pjanik, infe-

rior. Possibly you’re confusing my 
position with your own.” Tom’s 
pjanik immediately prostrated 
himself again. “No, I didn’t mean 
that.” He helped Tom’s pjanik up 
again. “I just meant that we who 
are born to the purple don’t con- 
sider being murdered quite such 
an honor as you lower classes.” 
“Really?” 

“In fact,” said the pjonik pja- 
nik, turning to Tom, Lucy and 
Drakvil, “may I ask why I’m be- 
ing assassinated?” 

“Why?” exploded Drakvil. 
“You ask why?” 

“A natural question, isn’t it?” 
asked Tom innocently. 

“Why, I never heard of such a 
thing!” fumed Drakvil. “A subject 
asking why. What galactic nerve! 
If I hadn’t promised you to my 
assistant here, and an Assassin’s 
word wasn’t as good as his bond 
— ” His fingers played angrily 
with the hilt of a hook-shaped 
knife attached to his harness. 

“I suppose you don’t know why 
either, young Apprentice?” said 
the pjonik sadly to Tom. “Well, I 
suppose I’ll die not knowing. 
Farewell, inferior.” 

The large eyes of Tom’s pjanik 
began to fill with sympathetic 
tears. 

“Go ahead,” fussed Drakvil. “I 
can’t. You must.” 

“No,” said Tom. 

“No?” said Drakvil, Lucy and 
the pjonik pjanik all at once. 



“No,” said Tom calmly. “I can- 
not, because of my wilf.” 

“I knew it!” bellowed Drakvil, 
turning chalk-white and staying 
that color. “That wilf! I knew it!” 
He turned on Lucy, who quickly 
got on the other side of Tom. 

Tom faced him and said, “Once 
I would have gornuled this sub- 
ject on the spot, without a hesita- 
tion. In fact with keen enjoyment. 
But my wilf has had its effect on 
me. This is — er — a far, far better 
thing I do than I have ever done 
before. The quality of mercy is 
not strained and no man is an is- 
land unto himself. If I should gor- 
mul this subject, I should be di- 
minished, even as an island dimin- 
ishes part of the main. Therefore 
never send to know for whom the 
bell tolls, because it’s already 
tolled for me.” 

U]Y|AD!” said Drakvil. “Stark, 
staring, raving mad. Poor, 
poor boy.” His color came back. 
His tone became more gentle. 
“Before I gornul you myself, 
Apprentice, and put you out of 
your misery — tell me. Why did 
you go this far before refusing to 
act?” 

“It was the least I could do for 
the Master to whom I’d been ap- 
prenticed,” said Tom. “I suspect- 
ed your honor had been im- 
pugned. I had to actually get face 
to face with the subject and you 
at the same time to make sure. 



THE FAITHFUL WILF 



151 



Now I know beyond any doubt.” 
“Honor?” said Drakvil, sud- 
denly stiffening. “The honor of a 
Master Assassin impugned? Who 
would dare?” 

“Who indeed,” said Tom, nudg- 
ing Lucy, “but an amateur assas- 
sin?” 

“Amateur?” Drakvil went 
chalk-white once more. 

“Yes,” said Tom. “I wouldn’t 
have had the least suspicion of 
him, if it hadn’t been for my wilf.” 
He nudged Lucy again. “It no- 
ticed the difference in the way I 
was acting. Didn’t you, wilf?” 

“Yes, I did,” said Lucy. 

“It wanted to know what was 
disturbing me.” 

“Yes, I did.” 

“It warned me faithfully that 
this amateur was out to dispose of 
me.” 

“Er — ” said Lucy, “yes, I did.” 
“Its warnings did not register 
on me properly until you slapped 
me with that briefing ray just be- 
fore I went into the gark. In that 
briefing was the information need- 
ed to complete the picture. This 
amateur arranged for me to be 
left behind on Bug’raf, just as he 
hired you through the Assassin’s 
Guild to train me as an Appren- 
tice. And he thoughtfully provid- 
ed this innocent pjonik pjanik as 
a subject for me to practice on, at 
the regular rates.” 

Drakvil said thoughtfully, his 
color returning. “What you say 



checks with my own knowledge, 
Apprentice. But nothing of it af- 
fects my honor.” 

“I will explain.” 

“Go ahead,” said Drakvil, tak- 
ing a long, sinister-looking gadget 
from his harness. “I have to reset 
my gornul anyway. Take a couple 
more moments if you like.” 

“Thank you,” said Tom. “Sup- 
pose you understand that what 
this amateur hoped and planned 
was that you would gornul me.” 
“How could he be so sure of 
that?” 

“Because,” said Tom, taking a 
deep breath, “he was prepared to 
violate your honor by forcing you 
to take on an Apprentice that he 
knew would never pass the test. 
You see, he knew I had a wilf.” 
Drakvil’s fingers stopped sud- 
denly on the gornul. He looked 
up. 

“He knew my wilf would stick 
by me.” 

“Yes, I would,” said Lucy. 

“And that, faithful as it> is to its 
principles and to me — ” 

“Yes, I am.” 

— it would, wilf-like, throw it- 
self before my gornul when I at- 
tempted to assassinate the sub- 
ject, thus creating a scandal that 
would reflect on you as my mas- 
ter, and cause you to destroy me 
on the spot.” > 

“Y — ” began Lucy; and stopped 
dead, staring at Tom with eyes 
almost as big as a pjanik’s.

Drakvil had beaten his previ- 
ous paleness of shade. He was 
now so white he was nearly trans- 
parent. 

“You see,” said Tom to him, 
“he didn’t care about the pjonik 
here, whom he had no reason to 
hire assassinated. He didn’t care 
about the expense you might be 
put to in buying a practice pjanik 
for me. He didn’t care about the 
scandal which would blacken your 
name in the Assassin’s Guild. All 
he was interested was in using 
you to get rid of me.” 

T'kRAKVIL was not only nearly 
transparent, he was swelling 
like a balloon. 

“Pardon me, little uncle,” said 
Tom’s pjanik meekly, “but why 
didn’t he just hire the noble As- 
sassin to destroy you in the first 
place?” 

“Well, you see,” said Tom in a 
kindly voice, “he couldn’t. For the 
same reason I couldn’t really 
adopt you. My race hasn’t ever 
subscribed to the Assassin Con- 
ventions. In fact — I’m on my way 
to Cayanho right now to discuss 
the Conventions and other things 
with the forty-three other domi- 
nant races’ representatives.” 

Drakvil had finally found his 
voice. “Where is he?” he wheezed. 
“Where is he?” 

“The Mordaunti Ambassador 
who marooned my wilf and I and 
hired you?” said Tom smoothly. 



“I imagine he’s on Gayahno by 
now. Very probably — ” Tom 
glanced at his watch — “he’s al- 
ready sitting down with the forty- 
three representatives in the Omni- 
Races Building board room.” 
“Platform!” said Drakvil, touch- 
ing a spot on his harness. The 
platform appeared. “On!” he or- 
dered. Tom jumped up on it and 
pulled Lucy after him. Tom’s pja- 
nik started to scramble aboard 
also, then stopped, confused. 

“Stay here, inferior,” said the 
pjonik pjanik. “I’ll adopt you.” 
“Oh, little father,” said the pja- 
nik, falling prostrate. Drakvil 
touched the platform. The room 
winked out around them and they 
winked in again in a long, hall- 
like chamber, with a semi-circle

of seats filled with a rainbow di- 
versity of different beings. The 
Mordaunti Ambassador was 
standing in the open space before 
these seats, addressing the rest of 
the representatives. 

“ — our responsibility to the 
former Jaktal members, and those 
races formerly under their domin- 
ion — ” he was saying. He broke 
off abruptly as he saw the plat- 
form with its occupants. 

“Now!” boomed Drakvil. Tom 
caught the Assassin’s hand as it 
was closing on the gornul. 

“Just a minute,” said Tom. 
“He’s mine.” 

“Yours?” Drakvil turned on 
Tom. 

“Though only an Apprentice, I 
believe I have rights under the 
Guild,” said Tom. 

“Yes,” Drakvil admitted thick- 
ly- 

“Then I believe I have the 
right of first offense from this be- 
ing, and so may challenge him to 
a duel before you yourself take 
action?” 

Drakvil glowered. 

“I’m going to have to do some 
work on that briefing machine,” 
he muttered. But he let go of the 
gornul. “Go ahead, then. I’ll 
watch.” 

The Mordaunti had buckled 
slightly at the knees on seeing 
Drakvil. But on hearing this, he 
straightened up again and his 
hands spread inward toward his 



own weapon harness. He smiled 
at Tom. 

“Though only an Apprentice,” 
said Tom to Drakvil, “would you 
say I might prevail in a duel with 
this being?” 

Drakvil snorted. 

“Only!” he said. “Only an Ap- 
prentice! You’ve been briefed, 
haven’t you? Naturally only an- 
other Guild member could hope 
to stand a chance with you, Ap- 
prentice or not.” 

T HE Mordaunti’s knees began 
to give again. He tried to 
smile but his satanic grimace was 
a little loose at the corners. 

“I just wondered,” said Tom. 
“I wouldn’t want the impression 
to get about the galaxy that I was 
trying to hide from the honorable 
Mordaunti representative.” 

He got down off the platform 
and walked across to a vacant 
chair he had spotted in the lowest 
tier of seats. It was a little large 
for him, being built to hold Jak- 
tals, but he seated himself in it. 

“Let me see,” he said thought- 
fully. “I will have to arrange for 
my wilf to be restrained so that it 
cannot prevent — ” 

“Hold!” cried the Mordaunti 
Ambassador in the lingua franca. 
Tom looked up, surprised. 

“No one could be more eager 
for a duel with the being from 
Earth than I,” said the Mor- 
daunti. His knees were quite

straight again. “But there is a 
higher duty. The obligations of a 
Member of this meeting.” 

“What?” said Tom. “I don’t 
understand. You have to fight 
me.” 

“Alas,” said the Mordaunti. 
“Forgive me.” 

“Forgive you? I insist you fight 
me. I insist — ” 

“Sadly, I must refuse. Sir, you 
have inadvertently seated your- 
self in the Jaktal chair, as a Mem- 
ber of this meeting.” 

“What?” cried Tom, looking 
about him. “What’d I do? You 
mean, just by sitting down here 
for a moment, I — ” 

“You invested yourself with 
diplomatic immunity,” said the 
Mordaunti. “Ambassadors may 
not duel with each other. That is 
a basic law of interracial politics. 
Otherwise our meetings would be- 
come disasters.” 

“But I just sat down for a 
minute!” 

“I’m sorry. The rule is strict.” 
“Curses!” said Tom. 

“We all sympathize.” 

“Why am I so absentminded?” 
“We all understand, I’m sure. 
It could happen to any new- 
comer. Unfortunately ignorance 
of the rule is no excuse.” 

“My courage,” said Tom, “will 
be called in question. The courage 
of the whole human race will 
probably be called in question.” 
“Not at all,” said the Mor- 



daunti smoothly, “I, myself, will 
be honored to introduce a resolu- 
tion of confidence in your courage 
and that of every member of your 
race.” 

“Well . .” said Tom. But the 
Mordaunti had already turned to 
speak to the filled seats of the 
semi-circle about Tom. And three 
Earth minutes later the vote was 
unanimous in favor of Tom’s and 
human courage, even Drakvil be- 
ing read into the minutes unoffi- 
cially as being in favor.

A that night, as they were pre- 
paring to retire on a Mordaunti 
bed that was like a golden cloud 
twelve feet around, “did that 
briefing really make you so dan- 
gerous? In just a second, like 
that?” 

Tom climbed onto the bed. 
Lucy was still tying the top of her 
filmy blue nightgown. He 
bounced experimentally. 

“Some bed,” he said. “Of course 
it didn’t. I know all I need to 
know, but it’d take years of ex- 
ercising to make my muscles 
respond as they need to for effec- 
tive use of the knowledge. Drak- 
vil, of course, wasn’t going to 
admit I wasn’t, though. His honor 
as an Assassin was at stake. That 
is why I think he was secretly 
pleased I didn’t have to duel the

Mordaunti, after all. — Are you 
going to put the lights out?” 

“In a minute,” said Lucy. She 
stood by the bed. “I want you to 
tell me something first.” 

“What?” 

“I want to know exactly what 
a wilf is. And you tell me the 
truth.” 

“Oh.” 

“Yes, oh.” 

“Well,” said Tom, slowly, “they 



look a lot like women. At least an 
alien might think they did. But 
they’re really a totally different 
race, monosexual. It’s just that 
they go around becoming deeply 
attached to beings of other races. 
Once they make friends, their 
faithfulness is proverbial in the 
galaxy.” 

“But why?” 

“Why?” 

“Why,” said Lucy, “do they be- 




come attached? What do they 
want to make friends for? What’s 
in it for them?” She looked nar- 
rowly at Tom. “They look so 
much like us and they go around 
attaching themselves. I want to 
know why!” 

“Oh,” said Tom. “I see. I see. 
Well, it’s not what you might 
think at all.” 

“It isn’t?” 

“No,” said Tom. “Different 
race, and all that. It’s just that 
wilfs have this strong moral sense. 
They have very high principles 
and their greatest joy is in con- 
verting some other being to these 



same principles. Naturally, there’s 
not much opportunity for them to 
improve other wilfs, these being 
as good as they can get already. 
So they try to get close to beings 
of other races, in a strictly intel- 
lectual way. That’s all.” 

“Oh,” said Lucy, “that’s all 
right, then.” 

She put out the lights and 
bounced into bed. 

“I’ve got plenty of low princi- 
ples” she said. “You like me that 
way, don’t you? You’d better say 
yes.” 

“Yes,” said Tom.

TITS gaudy wristwatch showed 
thirty minutes past nine, six 
July. It was time. From here on 
it was do the job right or be 
ruined. If not physically, then 
professionally. 

Finian. Smith dug for tools in 
the pouches of his imitation stom- 
ach. The left eye of the watch’s 
moon face gave a ludicrous wink 
to complete the time signal. 
Finian hated the watch. He’d 
gotten used to the confines of the 
camouflaged polymer leech cling- 
ing to the keel of the hydrofoiler. 
He’d gotten used to performing 
necessary bodily functions in in- 
timate contact with the leech’s 
servomechanisms for thirty-six 
hours. But the watch — never. 

It was effete, like his clothes. 
Effeteness was big this year. Next 
year it would be hand-loomed 
woolens. But he wasn’t being paid 
to inherit the soul of the man he 
was impersonating, after all. He 
applied the first of his meson 
torches to the thick hull. His long, 
pleasantly ugly face began to 
bead with perspiration. 

He had precisely four minutes 
to cut through. 

His face was half shadowed by 
the hull as he worked, half 
washed in flickering sunlight 
through anemone and brain coral. 
He defused a large U-shaped sec- 
tion and replaced the torch with 
a pistol unit fitted with a round 
cup at the muzzle. This cup he

applied to the hull. A blue whine 
of power — he forced the hull 
inward far enough to accommo- 
date entry to the fuel baffle 
chamber. 

He set a small black box to 
blow the polymer leech off the 
hull in fifty seconds, glad that he’d 
spent a full twenty nights under 
the hypnolearner. The penetra- 
tion plan was drummed so deeply 
into his skull he could operate 
like an automaton. 

With a last tool he re-sealed 
the hull, touched a stud and 
watched the tool collapse to 
gritty pumice. Right now the 
leech should be quietly disinte- 
grating, without so much as a 
murmur to disturb the TTIC spy 
radar. It took a lot of money to 
arrange this penetration, Finian 
thought. Knowing how much 
made him nervous. 

Finian hurried up a lonely 
companionway. Before stepping 
to the yacht’s deck he dusted his 
pleatless puce satin pantaloons 
and also made sure the precision 
camera, a combined effort of 
G/S dental technicians and optics 
men, was in place where his right 
front incisor had once been. The 
blade shutter’s release was a knob 
on the tooth’s inner surface, trig- 
gered by tongue pressure. Fake 
enamel would fly aside a micro- 
instant and TTIC secrets would 
be recorded for posterity, not to 
mention G/S market analysts. 



DECK, Finian adjusted his 
identification badge. 

Beneath his picture it said 
Woodrow Howslip, Missoula, 
Mont., Upper North American 
Distributorship. Finian hoped 
Woodrow Howslip was still lost 
in the Mojave Desert. If so, the 
only thing Finian had to worry 
over was his old enemy. 

Every few yards along the deck 
armed TTIC security men stood 
at attention; TTIC seemed to 
have innumerable armed guards. 
So did G/S for that matter. Fin- 
ian often wondered why. No one 
got angry any more, why have 
armed guards? 

“Hi, there, I’m Woody How- 
slip.” 

“Morning, sir.” The guard 
stared into the Pacific’s cobalt 
swell. 

“Say, fella. Last year when I 
came to see the new models inner- 
duced, I ran into a hell of a swell 
person — Spool or Stool. Sure 
like to buy him a drink. Is he on 
board?” 

“I don’t believe so, sir.” 

“Oh, too bad. Maybe he’ll show 
up. They always have the top 
dogs at these distributor shows. 
I hear Stool’s a top dog. Chief of 
company spies or something.” 

The guard concealed irritation. 

“Sprool, sir. Chief of industrial 
investigation.” 

Finian gigged the man’s ribs. 
“Keeps those Goods/ Services

jerks hopping, huh? Well, sorry 
Spool isn’t around. Maybe later. 
See you in the videofunnies — ” 
Overdoing it, Finian thought 
as he hurried along. Still, it was 
reassuring to know the intelli- 
gence was correct: Sprool was in 
Bombay. Finian had run up 
against him most recently when 
TTIC tried to steal G/S designs 
for the mid-year hairdo changes 
during the 2004-5 season. 

Finian joined a crowd of dis- 
tributors hurrying into an audi- 
torium beneath a banner reading: 

WELCOME 

Things to Come Incorporated 
World Distributors 
“Last Year’s Woman Is This 
Year’s Consumer” 

As he took a seat in the shad- 
owy hall he listened to voices all 
around: 

“It’s rumored she’s of the Gre- 
cian mode,” said the European 
Common Market distributor. 

“What? Copy the tripe G/S 
peddled two years ago?” That 
was the White/Blue Nile man. 

The Chinese distributor pro- 
tested: “Last year, too severe. 
Humble per cent of market drop 
severely. Five thousand years in 
fields, China women do not desire 
box haircut, woolen socks.” 

“Hope it’s a real smasher this 
time,” said the British Empire 
distributor, a seedy fellow wear- 



ing cologne. One rundown ware- 
house in Jamaica comprised the 
Empire any more. TTIC or G/S 
could buy or sell the Empire a 
thousand times. Or any other 
country. Finian was sweating. No 
wonder the stakes were so high. 

/~\N AN austere platform up 
front sat three men. One 
was a florid old gentleman with 
dewlaps and blue, vaguely crossed 
eyes. Another — a spindly type 
with a flower at each cuff — rose 
and was introduced by a loud- 
speaker as Corporate Director of 
Sales Northcote Hastings. 

“Thank you, thank you. I won’t 
waste time, gentlemen. You’ve 
traveled thousands of miles in 
secrecy and we appreciate it. We 
trust you also appreciate why we 
must maintain the mobility of our 
personality design center. One 
never knows when the — ah — 
competition nlight infiltrate a 
permanent site. They can’t match 
our sales in new personalities, so 
they try to outfight us with 
punches below the belt.” 

He fingered his, of ermine, to 
illustrate. Finian joined the 
laughter, but meant his. 

“After luncheon, gentlemen, 
you’re scheduled for individual 
sessions with o,ur designers, psy- 
chiatrists, plastic surgeons and 
sociability coordinators, not to 
mention apparel teams and ac- 
cessory experts.” 



THE SELLERS OF THE DREAM 



161 



Hastings glanced at the old 
gentleman with the vaguely 
crossed eyes. 

“Before we proceed, however, 

I should like to introduce TTIC’s 
beloved chairman of the board, 
Mr. Alvah Loudermilk. Stand up, 
Mr. Loudermilk.” The sales man- 
ager was plainly annoyed by hav- 
ing to make the introduction. The 
old dodderer took a step toward 
the podium. Hastings let a toler- 
ant smile be seen by the distribu- 
tors but did not relinquish the 
mike. 

“You can talk with Mr. Louder- 
milk personally later, gentlemen.” 

The florid old gentleman sat 
down again, as though no one ap- 
preciated him. Smoothly Hastings 
continued, “Let me get on by 
bringing forward the great design 
chief of Things to Come Incor- 
porated — ” He flung out a hand. 
“Dr. Gerhard Krumm.” 

The famed Krumm, an obese 
toad with the inevitable disar- 
rayed look of the corporate in- 
tellectual, walked to the podium. 
His apricot slippers, pantaloons 
and bolero jacket seemed to have 
come from a dustbin. Behind 
Krumm stage blowers whirred. 
They were readying curtains and 
screen. 

Finian slid his tongue near his 
tooth. 

“Gentlemen,” Krumm said, 
“first the bad news.” 

At the unhappy grumble he 



held up his hand. “Next year — 

I promise! — TTIC will abso- 
lutely and without qualification 
be ready to introduce the concept 
of the obsolescent male person- 
ality, exactly as we did in the 
female market ten years ago. I 
can only emphasize again the tre- 
mendous physical problems con- 
fronting us, and point to the lag 
in male fashion obsolescence that 
was not finally overcome until the 
late twentieth century, by the 
sheer weight of promotion. Men, 
unlike women, accept new decora- 
tive concepts slowly. TTIC has a 
lucrative share of the semi-annual 
male changeover, but we are 
years behind the female person- 
ality market. Next year we catch 
up.” 

“May we see what you have for 
the girls, old chap?” someone 
asked. “Then we’ll decide whether 
we’re happy.” 

“Very well.” Krumm began to 
read from a promotion script: 
“This year we steal a leaf from 
yesterday’s — uh — scented 
album.” The lights dimmed art- 
fully. Perfume sprayed the 
chamber from hidden ducts. A 
stereo orchestra swelled. The cur- 
tains parted. Finian’s upper lip 
was rolled back as far as possible. 

A nostalgic solido view of New 
York when it was once populated 
by people flashed on the screen. 
Violins throbbed thrillingly. 

“Remember the sweet, charm- 



162 



GALAXY 



ing girl of yesteryear? We capture 
her for you — warm, uncompli- 
cated, revelling in — uh, let’s see 
— sunlight and outdoor sports.” 
A series of solido slides, illus- 
trating Krumm’s points with shots 
of nuclear ski lifts or the Seine, 
merged one into another. 

“Gone is the exaggerated I.Q. 
of this year, gone the modish 
clothing. A return to softness. A 
simple mind, clinging, sweet. The 
stuff of everyman’s dreams. Gen- 
tlemen, I give you — ” 

Hidden kettledrums swelled. 
The name flashed on the screen: 
DREAM DESIRE. 

“Dream Desire! New Woman 
of the 2007-08 market year!” 

/^kVER enthusiastic applause 
Krumm continued: “At our 
thirty thousand personality alter- 
ation centers over the world, 
every woman will be able to 
change her body and mind, by 
means of surgical and psychologi- 
cal techniques of which TTIC is 
the acknowledged master, to be- 
come Dream Desire. Backed by 
the most intensive promotion 
program in history, we promise 
that more women will become 
Dream Desire than have ever be- 
come one of our previous models. 
Because, gentlemen, no woman 
could possibly resist becoming — 
this.” 

Sitting forward with tooth 
ready to shoot, Finian was un- 



prepared for the shock that 
awaited him. 

Onto the screen slid the naked 
figure of a girl. Only her back 
was exposed. Nothing could be 
seen of her face. Her hair was 
yellow, that was all. The flesh it- 
self was tanned, in sharp contrast 
to the pale library look currently 
being merchandised. The propor- 
tions of the girl’s buttocks had 
been surgically worked out to be 
almost the apex of voluptuous- 
ness. But what shook Finian to 
the soles of his mink slippers was 
a star-shaped raspberry mark on 
the new model’s left rear. 

That isn’t Dream Desire, he 
thought wildly. That’s — that’s — 

“We begin with the, uh, rear 
elevation,” said Krumm. “In that 
colorful mark you see TTIC 
marketing genius. That mark will 
stamp the woman who buys this 
new personality as a genuine 
Dream Desire, not a shoddy G/S 
counterfeit. To be frank, adoption 
of this unique — ah — signature, 
was not planned. When we sought 
a girl for our prototype, we dis- 
covered the girl we chose was 
blessed with such a mark. It in- 
spired serendipity. But this is just 
the beginning. See what we have 
done with the face.” 

Only just in time did Finian 
remember to trigger his tooth and 
take a shot of the rear elevation 
before the front view flashed on. 
The girl, naked and coy on a di-

van, had pink cheeks, red lips, 
china blue doll eyes. Pretty, in a 
cuddlesome, vapid way. 

Quickly he exposed two more 
frames. He was falling apart, 
muffing the job. Krumm’s voice 
became a drone detailing the sur- 
gical and analytical procedures 
necessary for a woman to buy the 
appearance and personality of 
Dream Desire. Finian didn’t hear 
a thing about price schedules or 
what lower-priced models were 
contemplated. He photographed 
each slide mechanically, thinking 
of the raspberry mark. 

It’s not Dream Desire, he said 
to himself. My God — it’s Dolly 
Novotny. 

Not the face, not the breasts. 
But there, far down in the eyes. 
They weren’t even brown any 
more. But colored contacts could 
change eyes so easily. 

Never had he been more pro- 
foundly shocked. His own sweet 
lost Dolly! 

A heavy hand seized his 
shoulder. 

“Here he is!” 

Finian was dragged from his 
seat. A searing light flashed in his 
face. 

“Well, well. Finian Smith. 
When you took hold of that rail 
coming into the hall, you should 
have recalled we have sweat 
prints for all you G/S boys. Give 
me the camera and come along 
quietly,” finished Sprool. 



UT THOUGHT you were in 
Bombay,” said Finian. “I 
got bum information.” 

Sprool smiled somewhere in 
the depths of his almost colorless 
eyes. His pale, saturnine face, 
however, was devoid of humor. 

“Never trust Lyman Pushkyn 
for information, Fin. Since when 
is an advertising man qualified to 
supervise an industrial investiga- 
tion program?” 

“You’re right. I tried to get 
them to give me the post once.” 

“Did you? I didn’t realize that. 
When?” 

“Right after I was cashiered by 
the DOCs and finished my first 
case for G/S." He couldn’t repress 
a smile. “The time I stole your 
men’s changeover layouts by dis- 
guising myself as part of the 
lavatory wall. When you still had 
the design center on land, out in 
California.” 

Sprool chuckled flatly. “We’ve 
been friendly enemies quite a 
while, haven’t we, Fin?” 

“You never put one over on me 
like this, though.” 

“Shame you forgot sweat 
prints.” 

“My own damned fault.” Finian 
thrust out his jaw. “I’ll take what’s 
coming. I was counting on this 
play to cut through all that stupid 
bureacracy at the top of G/S and 
maybe net me the chief investi-

gator’s post.” Finian scowled out 
the office porthole to the heaving 
blue Pacific. Sprool smoothed 
thinning hair. 

“Might as well give me the 
camera.” 

Finian made a show of dipping 
into his artificial paunch. He 
come up with a palm-sized micro 
35 mm and snapped open the case 
release. He pulled the leader on 
the casette all the way out, ex- 
posing the film. Chuckling, Sprool 
picked up the cylinder. 

“Very nice, Finian. May I now 
have the real camera?” 

“Ah, you slick bastard,” grum- 
bled Finian. This time he took a 
piece of equipment from beneath 
his singlet. Sprool dropped it 
down a hissing disposal tube. 

“You look positively vengeful, 
Fin.” 

“I could smash a few heads 
right now. That damn G/S Comp- 
troller Central makes investiga- 
tors do their own penetration 
work-ups. They’re nickle-nursers 
besides. I thought of sweat prints. 
They said the corrective was too 
expensive. I wasn’t positive you 
had the index on file, so — ” 

“Fin, please don’t bristle. Re- 
member we have telephotos on 
you at this very moment. In that 
bust of Loewy, for instance. His 
collar button is watching you. 
Don’t fight me and you won’t get 
hurt. TTIC is a business opera- 
tion just like G/S. Firm but 



paternalistic. When we dispose of 
an irritant, we do it with flexibili- 
ty and permanence, but no phy- 
sical pain.” 

“That’s nice to know, consider- 
ing you’ll probably ruin my 
career.” 

“Were you ever really cut out 
for business, Fin?” 

“If I wasn’t what the hell was I 
cut out for? Not the DOCs.” 

S PROOL raised a chiding finger. 

“See? That burst of temper 
is all too typical of you. People 
simply don’t rock the boat these 
days, Fin. Why, if either G/S or 
TTIC went for more than a 50% 
share of the renewal personality 
market — plus or minus the 2% 
gain or lose as a result of spying, 
design leaks and so forth — the 
U.N. would have its economic 
cycle theorists down on us in- 
stantly.” 

“God, Sprool, I try and try. I 
guess I just wasn’t meant to be 
a twenty-first century man. I 
never had the proper education, 
like those reading primers written 
by the market boys from — 
where was it? — BBDO? I went 
to private school. On my Pop s 
knee.” 

“Then your attitudes are un- 
derstandable. How can you ex- 
pect to be anything but yourself 
when your father was a Gal- 
braither? Perhaps the last of that 
persuasion allowed to teach eco- 



166 



GALAXY 



nomics in public universities? 
Your father was dead set against 
the kind of obsolescence practiced 
by the corporations we both rep- 
resent. The two largest corpora- 
tions in the world!” 

“Pop wanted consumer money 
spent on libraries, schools, high- 
ways, pretty green roadside pic- 
nic parks.” 

“None of which contributes 
very much to keeping the world 
plant running at top output. None 
of which provides the millions of 
jobs needed to give black and 
yellow and white alike ample 
opportunity for the good life. If 
you’d only understand yourself, 
how you fit the scheme of things.” 
“I don’t. That’s the trouble. 
What the hell am I supposed to 
do, join the prisoners in New 
York? I keep quiet about what I 
think. I did it well enough to be 
an operative for the Department 
of Obsolescence Control. I was 
doing all right until — ” 

Memory clouded his brow. He 
wriggled deep down in the foam 
of his chain He wished he were 
free of this hellish interview, free 
to think on the problem of Dream 
Desire who was not Dream Desire 
at all but Dolly. 

“Until what? I never really 
knew.” 

“Until I rocked the boat, God 
damn it! I was chief of the In- 
diana bureau. I tried to stop a 
car-smash rally a week before the 



new models came out. The dis- 
trict supervisor was there, making 
a speech. I thought I saw a kid 
inside one of the levacars the 
crowd was pushing into the Wa- 
bash River. I went to see, hold 
back the crowd. The district 
supervisor told me to stop. I hit 
him. 7 hit him. You know what 
happens when you hit an execu- 
tive.” 

Finian pinched the bridge of 
his nose to shut out the ugly 
memory. At length he added, “In 
case you never heard the rest of 
the story either, a wreck crew 
examined the levacar afterward. 
There was no kid inside. Only a 
big mechanical doll somebody 
had forgotten to take out before 
the smash.” 

“Very touching,” said Sprool 
emptily. 

“Come on, Sprool. Let’s get this 
over.” 

“Of course. But let me make 
one more point. Do you know 
why I’m here, not in Bombay?” 

“The mental riot at the TTIC 
nylon plant was a fake.” 

“Not at all. The rioters were 
manning the controls of the 
motorized strikegangs day and 
night, from their homes. The mo- 
ment TTIC cabled agreement to 
their demand for two extra holi- 
days, before and after Nehru’s 
birthday, they gave up all their 
other requests — for free anti- 
cigarette immunization and the

like. People are soft, Fin. They 
cooperate. It must be so, or the 
plant would stop functioning. 
How many billions do G/S and 
TTIC employ? Put those people 
out of work — disaster! Hunger, 
pestilence, real rioting. The peo- 
ple also have another role to fill, 
as consumers. If they’re unhappy, 
they respond less adequately to 
advertising. The plant slows 
down. Why, until TTlC con- 
ceived the idea of introducing 
new female personalities every 
year, not just new clothes but 
complete new mental patterns, 
the world was headed for ruin. 
We ran out of new gadgets long 
ago.” 

iiT^ON’T kid me,” Finian said 
cynically. “Personality ob- 
solescence was thought up by Old 
Man Pharoh of G/S. His grand- 
dad told him a story about the 
Kennedy lady’s mushroom hair 
changing the style overnight and 
it started him thinking.” 

“He had considerable help 
from Alvah Loudermilk.” 

“Who cares? All I say is, it’s 
a hell of a shame the Triple Play 
War didn’t end in something be- 
sides a stalemate. We wouldn’t 
have had everybody palsy-walsy, 
black and white and yellow. And 
this damned population problem 
— the first rockets rusting on the 
moon and nobody interested in 
following them in person. Every- 



body’s a consumer and a worker 
and — and damn it, soft as jello. 
And it’s a miserable mess from 
top to bottom.” 

Sprool was genuinely shocked. 

“Fin, are you seriously advo- 
cating periodic wars?” 

Finian shielded his eyes from 
the sun falling through the port. 
“Oh, no. I can’t think of anything 
else, that’s all. Fatness or fighting, 
fighting or fatness. In my book 
they’re both lousy. I wish there 
were a third way. I can’t think of 
one. Maybe if I were smart like 
you — ” Finian stopped, bitterly. 

Sprool dialed a magenta visor- 
phone. “Really, Fin, this is be- 
coming pointless temperament.” 
Into the phone he said, “We’re 
ready, Doctor.” To Finian again: 
“Please don’t try to reform our 
delicately balanced world, my 
friend. At least not until we scrub 
your mind clean of what you saw 
in the auditorium.” 

A shiver crawled on Finian’s 
spine. 

“Scrub — ?” 

Too late. Pneumatic doors slid 
aside. Two unsavory specimens 
in white smocks bordered with 
lace wheeled a rubber-tired me- 
chanism into the room. Before 
Finian could move they adjusted 
several wing nuts and lowered a 
bowl device over his head. He 
tried to stand up, cursing. He was 
quickly but painlessly pinioned 
by sleek tubular metal arms

clasping him from the back of 
the chair. 

“The worst damage you did 
was on film,” Sprool said, striding 
back and forth, dry-washing his 
hands. “I naturally assume that 
in your heightened nervous state, 
what you saw with your eyes 
didn’t make much of an impres- 
sion. But we’ll be sure. Give him a 
mild jolt to start, boys.” 

Several sinister cathode tubes 
began to hiss at various points on 
the machine. Finian felt a tingle 
on his scalp, similar to a healthful 
massage. He closed his eyes and 
tried to remember the rear ele- 
vation of Dream Desire. 

He panicked. 

Almost as though there were a 
mental vacuum cleaner in his 
head, certain synapses were 
blocked, certain memory recep- 
tors temporarily sucked dry. The 
technique was a portion of that 
employed in changing the female 
consumer’s intelligence quotient 
from year to year to conform to 
the new personality design she 
purchased. It made Finian fume 
to think of them tampering with 
his skull. He was no rotten Met- 
ropolis wife merchandised into 
adopting the latest fashion trend. 
He writhed ferociously. Sprool 
looked on with disapproval. 

Try as he might, Finian could 
not remember what — good lord! 
He’d forgotten the name! 

What did she look like? What ? 



He had a blurry recollection of 
colors on a screen, little else. The 
laboratory cretins unhooded him. 
The chair relaxed. Sprool assisted 
him to his feet. 

“Feeling better? Free of un- 
pleasant memories?” 

“You’ve no business tamper- 
ing — ” 

Dolly Novotny had a raspberry 
mark. 

So did Dream Desire. 

“Yeah. Yeah, I’m okay.” 

TT TOOK all Finian’s strength 
to keep from revealing that the 
mental dike had just burst. 

He wasn’t really surprised. 
Dolly Novotny had once meant 
far more to him than assignment 
could. She would again, when he 
learned how and why she — 

He laughed inwardly. Poor 
Sprool. He’d stolen a march. Two. 
Finian still had the tooth camera. 
And how could Sprool know 
Finian wanted to — must — 
remember Dolly Novotny, be- 
cause she was the only creature 
he ever really loved? 

Dolly was the girl to whom he’d 
been engaged, before her parents 
broke it off after he was cashiered 
from the DOCs. An ex-DOC who 
became an industrial investigator 
was little more than a lowlife spy 
in their estimations. Finian had 
been away so much, on assign- 
ment. Dolly had tried to resist her 
parents, but they held the cash- 



THE SELLERS OF THE DREAM 



169 



box for a modeling career. She 
tried; she loved him. But one day 
when he came back to Bala Cyn- 
wyd she was gone. The whole 
family had moved. 

Finian received one final letter. 
He thought from the words, or 
rather what was between them, 
really, that she still loved him. 
The words were obviously par- 
entally ghosted. 

Blinking at Sprool now, scratch- 
ing his scalp to relieve the prickle, 
Finian realized anew the rather 
disheartening truth. He was a 
maverick. Pop had made him so, 
against his mother’s shrill pro- 
tests. So be it. Especially since 
someone — the system, maybe, 
he didn’t know, cared less because 
a man couldn’t really fight a sys- 
tem, not an ordinary man anyway 
— had corrupted the flesh he 
loved so well. 

Finian was vaguely aware of 
Sprool, bland, pointing. 

“Up that stairway, Fin. Directly 
to the vertijet takeoff stage. Spare 
you the embarrassment of going 
on deck.” He extended his hand. 
“Luck, Fin. I hope the sacking 
isn’t too bad.” 

Finian slipped the hand aside. 
He grinned. If you had to be a 
loony, why not enjoy it? 

“Thanks for nothing, pal.” 

He marched defiantly up the 
stairs into sunlight. 

Who had Sprool been kidding 
about paternalism? Three hours 



later the vertijet hovered six 
inches from Lyman Pushkyn’s 
green front door, the lawn of 
Panpublix on the outskirts of the 
Eastern metropolis. Finian was 
rudely pushed out. The vertijet 
climbed a white column of vapor 
into the sky. 

Finian picked fresh-cut grass 
from his pantaloons. Oh, that 
kind, gentle Sprool. On his in- 
structions the vertijet pilot had 
beamed an anonymous message 
on the Panpublix band, announc- 
ing that Finian Smith was being 
returned to continental U.S. by a 
TTIC skycraft. Still, Finian had 
one ace to stave off financial dis- 
aster. 

Five minutes later he lost it. 

A squad of G/S industrial 
guards boiled onto the lawn and 
hustled Finian to a cold tile room 
in the personnel wing. There, he 
discovered two astonishing things. 
One, the corporation was not 
quite so paternalistic as it masked 
itself to appear. The policeman 
roughed him as they stripped him. 
Two, the vast G/S industrial 
police force was not the harmless, 
aimless body it looked to be from 
outside. Apparently the guards 
were paid so well because they 
had to move savagely if a bubble 
boiled up the bland surface of the 
world stew. 

In fact, their professionalism 
with the see-rays in the personnel 
lab relieved him, howling and

kicking and pummeling, of the 
precious tooth-camera, just before 
he was hustled to Pushkyn’s floor. 

Ill 

13ANPUBLIX was the wholly- 
owned internal advertising 
agency for G/S. The building 
loomed forty stories. Within its 
curtainwalls quite a few thousand 
communicators devoted them- 
selves to the task of planning and 
executing campaigns to move the 
bodies, as the expression went. 
The fortieth, or solarium, floor be- 
longed the agency’s executive 
officer, Pushkyn, into whose 
presence Finian was unceremoni- 
ously thrust. 

“You miserable creep,” Lyman 
said, as he shooed away his mas- 
seuse and beetled his thick 
Ukrainian brows. “You bumbler, 
you! We heard all about your 
incredible performance from 
Sprool’s agents. You’re fired. 
Blackballed. Eradicated. Ka- 
poosht.” 

Finian had a hard light in his 
eyes. He sat down, tilted his feet 
to the chaise footrest and dialed 
the arm for a B- complex cock- 
tail. “Lyman, those goonies of 
yours messed me up. I never 
knew they were more than win- 
dow dressing. I didn’t know they 
were supposed to fight.” 

Pudgy Pushkyn snapped the 
elastic of his old rose knicker- 



bockers. His stomach, lumpy and 
white as the rest of him, hung out 
unglamorously. 

“Rock the boat some more, 
creepnik. You’ll find out how they 
can fight.” 

“Oh shut up. I delivered your 
pictures. Even if your men did 
take them by force.” 

Pushkyn turned his back. “Ped- 
dle it another place, jerk. You’re 
through.” 

“You can’t talk to me that way. 
If you hadn’t chintzed about a 
lousy sweat-print job — ” 

Pushkyn squinted around. “So 
that’s how. That Sprool, he’s a 
regular fiend.” 

“Damn it, Lyman — ” 
Extending a trembling sausage 
finger Pushkyn breathed, “You we 
ought to have psyched, deep and 
permanent. What a fool I was to 
string along with you for years! 
A stumblebum private cop digni- 
fying himself by calling himself 
an industrial investigator. Come 
in here storming, cursing — no 
wonder the DOCs kicked you 
out!” 

Momentarily bewildered, Fini- 
an countered, “Lyman, your own 
guards — ” 

“Quiet! We’ll get a nice fat rap 
in the public image when the in- 
vestigator trade journals pick up 
the story of how G/S flopped.” 
Glowering, Finian stalked him. 
“Regardless of that, I delivered. 

I want my fee.”

“I’ll be damned if I — ” 
Conflict was temporarily fore- 
stalled by the arrival of a thin 
assistant art director, carrying a 
square item masked in gray silk. 
Finian stared moodily at the G/S 
model announcement layouts in 
the wall display racks. The trade- 
name of the new G/S woman and 
her figure were greeked; but from 
the woodcut and steel-engraving 
technique of the gatefold and 
bleed comps, Finian suspected 
G/S was going to market a bit of 
nostalgia even older than the kind 
chosen by TTIC. Bustless, man- 
dolins and stereopticons by gas- 
light? Finian had a prepossessing 
urge to throw up. 

“Want to see this, chief?” said 
the assistant art director. 

He whipped off the silk, re- 
vealing an oil painting in a plat- 
inum frame. 

“What the rinkydink hell is 
that?” Pushkyn cried. 

The art director blanched. 
“Why, chief, it’s R. R. Pharoh 

III!” 

“Of course, of course, jerkola. 
You think I don’t know? I haven’t 
seen the old smeller in three years 
maybe, but think I don’t know 
the chairman of my own bread 
and butter? Why the fancy-fancy 
oil treatment? You do it?” 

“Spare time, only, chief,” trem- 
bled the art director. “Got a 
memo. Salinghams — you know, 
the audiotonal effects veep — 



memoized Pharoh. Wanted a per- 
sonal portrait of his leader. 
Pharoh memoized me, okaying 
having his picture done. I patched 
together this little work from the 
descriptive PR biog. There aren’t 
any good portraits extant.” n 
“W hy bring it to me?” 

“But chief! You memoized me 
when I memoized you that — ” 

“I did? Oh, yeah. Well, I’m 
busy. Take it to Salinghams.” 

T HE ART director veiled his 
creation and disappeared 
down the tube. Pushkyn was 
about to speak to Finian when he 
noted the gray sweat patina on 
Finian’s face. He demanded to 
know whether Finian was ill. 

“Nothing, nothing’s wrong,” 
said Finian, shivering, wildly 
curious. 

The image in the portrait 
burned into Finian’s skull. It was 
that of a florid old gentleman with 
dewlaps and blue, vaguely 
crossed eyes. 

Tightening his nerves, Finian 
said, “Pushkyn, let me lay it out. 
I got to have the fee. I need it to 
find the prototype of the TTIC 
girl. I used to know her.” 

A visorphone glowed. Pushkyn 
slapped the command button. A 
pale man danced up and down on 
the screen. 

“Chief, chief, it’s a break- 
through, a breakthrough! We 
turned up the TTIC pilot plant

just an hour ago. Molecular tri- 
angulation. My God, sir, it’s a 
miracle of deception. Manhattan! 
The prison! An old rundown dis- 
tillery company building in the 
worst stews of — ” He consulted 
a paper. “Parkave, that’s the 
place.” 

Listening transfixed, Pushkyn 
started, slid his gaze to Finian 
and snarled at the screen, “Oh, 
boy, is your fat in the fire. Call me 
back.” He shut off and squinted 
at Finian, whose mind churned. 
“You were talking?” 

Finian swallowed hard. “Push- 
kyn, I must find out what’s hap- 
pened to the girl they made into 
the TTIC prototype. If they’ve 
changed her they’ve done wrong. 
She was sweet and desirable. 
They’ve made her all soft and dis- 
gusting. Like marshallow.” 

“The new TTIC broad? You 
were hot for her once, that it?” 
“That’s it. I was only holding 
back the camera so you’d pay me. 
Give me a chance!” 

“Think we run a sniveling 
charity?” Pushkyn’s sweeping 
gesture encompassed the heavens 
and the pulsing, overpopulated 
smog banks beneath. “We gotta 
keep the plant running! Create 
demand every minute! Off with 
the old woman! On with the new! 
The old woman, she smells, she’s 
out of date! We got a crusade here 
at Panpublix! We got a holy mis- 
sion! You want the plant wheels 



to stop like they put sand in 
them? While we take care of your 
personal problems? Don’t be a 
jerkola. Like to argue about the 
fee? I’ll call up the guards again.” 
Something akin to a cool rush 
of air swept Finian’s brain. 

“Then I’ll find her without the 
fee, Lyman.” 

“Hah-hah, sure. Big independ- 
ent operator, big millionaire. Go 
get psyched and lose those hostile 
tendencies. Don’t rock the world, 
she don’t rock so good. Every- 
body’s happy, you be happy. Go 
grub and be happy.” 

“I’m not happy. All of a sudden 
I’m not happy, if people like you 
made the only girl I ever fell in 
love with obsolete.” 

“Get out, chummo. I don’t like 
you any more. You’re dangerous.” 
Finian Smith nodded crisply. “I 
could very well be.” And left. 

A S FINIAN left the Panpublix 
building he heard a men- 
acing hiss. He tried to dodge the 
rainbow spray. Too late. 

His clothing was soon soaked 
with a noxious admixture of 
water, special nitrites and phos- 
phorous compounds shot into the 
air by the underground sprinkler 
system. 

At the levacar station he finally 
controlled his anger. How petty 
they could be, to order the lawns 
sprinkled just then.

Waiting passengers moved 
away and made rude remarks 
about his smell. Finian found him- 
self sole occupant of the front car 
on the ride down the Philadelphia 
spur. 

The enforced loneliness gave 
him a chance to organize his 
muddled thoughts and decide 
what course of action he had to 
pursue concerning Dolly Nov- 
otny. 

Two facts he possessed. What 
they meant, he didn’t know. 

A likely place to find her was 
the TTIC pilot plant on Manhat- 
tan, the prison island. Still, he was 
certain to have a rough time get- 
ting onto the island and into the 
plant after that. With few re- 
sources at his disposal it might be 
better to pursue the other thread 
a bit. 

Its significance left him even 
more muddled. Alvah Louder- 
milk, TTIC chairman, had ap- 
peared at the dealer presentation, 
somewhat to the annoyance of his 
inferiors. And R. R. Pharoh, top 
G/S executive, hadn’t been acting 
quite sensibly either when he per- 
mitted an oil portrait of himself 
to be painted. Finian had never 
seen a public photo of either man. 
Both executives were practically 
legendary. 

Then why in the name of Gal- 
braith did both look so much like 
each other? 

When Finian thought on it, one 



cold, unpleasant word gnawed his 
head. Conspiracy. 

A moment later his profession- 
al memory dredged up a source 
for proving or disproving his odd 
theory. What he intended to do 
with evidence, if any existed, he 
couldn’t say. But he had a vague 
desire to be armed with a little 
more certainty before he sought 
Dolly. 

An achingly musical name. 
Dolly, Dolly — 

He remembered her so well, 
from summer evenings on the 
back porch before Bala Cynwyd, 
like the other suburbs, was swal- 
lowed in the fester of the metrop- 
olis. 

Her dark hair. Her gentle eyes. 
Her animated mouth. And the 
raspberry mark, one night during 
an electrical storm. 

She’d tentatively shared Fin- 
ian’s inherited ideas about their 
constantly obsolete world, ideas 
long suppressed in him and now 
flooding back under the double 
stimulus of Sprool’s lecture and 
Pushkyn’s vindictive parsimony. 
Dolly hadn’t exactly been sympa- 
thetic. The philosophy of endur- 
ing worth was too daring even 
then. (Today it was sheer luna- 
cy.) But neither -had she been as 
adamant as most citizens. As her 
parents, for example. They re- 
placed their furniture monthly 
with the latest G/S fiberboard 
laminate imitation Finnish mod- 



174

ern modes. Good consumers, both. 

Then came his dismissal from 
the DOCs, the enforced break- 
up — 

The levacar slowed for Bala 
Cynwyd. In the abstract, remodel- 
ing a woman’s mind to make her 
the pattern to which nearly all 
other women in the world could 
conform was acceptable to 
Finian. When it came to the 
specific of changing Dolly to the 
marshmallow-trumpery creature 
looming on the screen behind 
Krumm, that was too much. 

A S HE stepped off at Bala Cyn- 
wyd, it began to rain. He 
hurried along beneath warped 
building fronts of chartreuse and 
electric blue extruded plastic. 
From a doorway a hapless bum in 
last year’s pseudo-cotton sport 
clothes begged for three dollars 
for a tube of model cement to 
sniff. Finian shuddered and 
walked faster. He stopped at Abe 
Kane’s Autosuiter, the last shop 
left open on the block, selected a 
few new clothes from the plastic 
catalogue sheets fastened to the 
walls, and fed his universal credit 
card into the slot after punching 
out his measurements. 

A red lucite sign blinked on: 
Credit N. G. 

Finian frowned, hit the cancel 
lever and tried again. The third 
time he tried, his card was not 
returned. 



Pushkyn! Damn the vindictive 
bastard. 

He trudged on through the 
rain, never having felt so alone in 
his life. It was a queer sensation, 
the total absence of credit. Once, 
he remembered dimly, Pop had 
brought home a suit of clothes 
purchased with. cash. It had 
caused a near-riot among Bala 
Cynwyd burghers. 

Reaching his shabby apart- 
ment, Finian changed from the 
effete suit, scrubbed up as best 
he could, packed his few belong- 
ings into a satchel and walked 
back into the rain. He passed a 
crowd of workers from the local 
G/S visorphone plant. It special- 
ized in treating receiver parts 
with reagents that would crack 
the plastic precisely eight months 
after installation. 

A little smog had mixed with 
the rain, turning the street 
ghostly. At a corner booth Finian 
used his last few coins to make 
a toll call to the House of Sinatra 
in Los Angeles. 

A sound truck rolled past, re- 
peating over and over, “Gee-ess, 
Gee-ess, don’t guess, it’s bess — 
Take free shuttle at Exit 5-6 to 
the G/S Plaza — Gee-ess, 
don’t — ” 

A dapper young man appeared 
on the screen, snapping his fingers. 

“Hiyah. What can this gasser 
of a full-service bank do for you, 
Clyde?” 



THE SELLERS OF THE DREAM 



175 



Finian showed his bank identi- 
fication card. 

“I’d like to withdraw my bal- 
ance.” 

The banker came back into 
view a moment later. “Get lost. 
Your balance is nonesville. Gar- 
nisheed at noon. Unperformance 
and non-fulfilling of verbal con- 
tract, with waiver of cooperation. 
You signed it, Charlie.” 

“Damn it, I performed — 
Finian began. 

The screen had already 
blacked. 

He staggered into the drifting 
smog. So Pushkyn had gone that 
far. Just for the sake of meanness. 
Well, Finian Smith would show 
the whole rotten bunch. They had 
angered him now. He wasn t quite 
witless, not yet. 

Gee-ess, Gee-ess, it’s bess came 
a lonely bellow. The polluted 
smog made Finian cough. His 
eyes smarted as he turned his 
pockets inside out. 

A dollar left. Enough for a cup 
of coffee. No transportation. Just 
a single walking man in a cloud 
of industrial fumes and a long, 
empty night for thinking of Dolly. 

Resolutely Finian hefted his 
satchel and started out to walk to 
Missouri. 

IV 

T HIRTY-SIX days later Finian 
staggered into the National 
Record Office in R'olla. Thirty-six 



frightening, alarming, eye-open- 
ing, solitary, transfiguring days 
they had been, too. 

Days of dodging robot leva- 
cars whose spot-beams hunted 
him in the shadows beneath the 
elevated turnpikes, seeking to ar- 
rest him for pedestrianship. 

Days of remembering his Pop. 
And nights too. Especially nights, 
thinking as he lay under a berry 
bush half-starved and chilly, how 
Pop had enjoyed prizefights, anti- 
social, uncooperative prizefights. 
How young Finian had been 
dragged to lonely boxcars or dim 
garages where furtive men 
watched the sport before it was 
finally stamped out in the name 
of bland humanity. 

The world too was one bland 
custard, blandly happy. Except 
not really, as Finian, horrified, 
discovered. 

No plant could function at total 
efficiency, at complete peak year 
after year. A low percentage of 
chronic unemployment had never 
been whipped by the cyclic theo- 
rists. Strange wild caravans of 
men and wives and children, hu- 
man wolves almost, passed Finian 
occasionally on red-leafed back- 
roads in Pennsylvania and Ohio. 
He almost fell into the hands of 
one such band. Thereupon he de- 
cided he must possess a weapon 
of self-defense at all costs. His 
belly he could protect by shovel- 
ing in wild berries and an occa- 



176 



GALAXY 



sional stolen chunk of honeycomb. 
But his life, against such a seeth- 
ing pack of wild creatures as he 
had fled from on that lonely road, 
needed more dependable protec- 
tion. 

Difficult problem. Under law, 
weapons were prohibited except 
upon special occasions. What ne- 
cessity for weapons when all was 
pleasant cooperation? 

Yet the G/S guards carried 
weapons. So did the TTIC in- 
ternal force. Finian was beginning 
to believe he knew why that 
might be so. Too early to tell, 
however. And the other problem 
pressed him to concentration 
upon it. 

Weapon-devotees were even 
more suspect than pedestrians in 
the lonely country between met- 
ropolises. Occasionally Finian 
glimpsed a wire compound, acres 
and* acres, against the sunburnt 
horizon. Manhattan Prison was 
too far for local DOCs to send re- 
calcitrant Hoosier or Buckeye 
anti-obsols, so they were thrown 
into smaller country compounds, 
together with those few madmen 
who settled disputes with fists. 
Such compound inmates were de- 
scribed as juves, Finian remem- 
bered, passing one such wire en- 
closure on a white moonlit night 
and shuddering. He didn’t recog- 
nize the term juve, but it obvious- 
ly meant the middle-aged or 
geriatric specimens huddled with- 



in the cages, a few defiantly wear- 
ing ancient gaudy jackets with 
mottoes stitched on them, forgot- 
ten anarchist slogans like Pflu- 
ger’s Idle Hour Pin Barons. 

/"kN THE outskirts of South 
Bend, Finian luckily came 
upon an obsolescence carnival. 

Several thousand people 
swarmed across a treeless terrain 
in a housing project smash. Mo- 
torized workgangs stood at the 
development’s fringe, waiting to 
set up new prefab Moorish Man- 
ors to replace obsolete Five-Bed- 
room Geneva Chateaux. 

Finian infiltrated the wild car- 
nival crowd, ripping draperies and 
smashing furniture with feigned 
laughter ringing from his lips. 
When the carnival wore itself out 
near dawn and the workgangs 
rolled in through clouds of soy- 
fuel smoke, Finian filched a shiny 
flick-blade knife from a Boy 
Scout chopping up a last slab of 
plastic plaster and lath. 

The Scout shrieked for the 
DOCs on duty. Finian was away 
and running through a hydro- 
ponic cornfield before he could be 
caught. 

Now, dressed in his only pre- 
sentable suit, last year’s G/S Nub- 
by Oppenheimer, he flashed his 
personal identification card before 
the computer grid in the empty 
green marble rotunda of the Na- 
tional Record Office. Personal 



THE SELLERS OF THE DREAM 



177 



identity was one quantity Push- 
kyn couldn’t revoke. 

Finian felt his fingers tingle as 
the grid scanned the card. 

“Investigator Smith, Bond 
Number PA-5006, you are recog- 
nized.” 

“Permission to examine owner- 
ship statements for corporations 
over one billion, please.” 

“What year?” buzzed the me- 
chanical voice. 

“Not certain,” Finian replied. 
“Could be as far back as 1980 or 
even 1970.” 

“Second tier from lowest level. 
Tube nine, your left.” 

It gave Finian a weird sensa- 
tion, plummeting in the airtube 
and realizing he was dropping 
eighty stories into the depths of 
the nation’s largest insane asylum. 
But legal transactions had pro- 
liferated so in the past decades, 
as had neurotic behavior, that 
only a combined institution and 
record office was feasible for sav- 
ing space and offering a less-than- 
fatal end for hopeless maniacs. 

The reading room below 
ground smelled of mold. Gray 
block walls heightened the un- 
pleasant mood. Finian sat at the 
callout console. He manipulated 
the controls and spoke into the 
unit: 

“Let me have the volume cover- 
ing Goods/Service corporation for 
— ah — 1974, please.” 

Several minutes passed. A door 



slid aside. A white male, perhaps 
seventy, with yellow-rimmed lack- 
luster eyes and a lantern jaw, 
shuffled in and waited with docile 
manner. The creature wore a 
seedy twill uniform, anciently cut. 

“What do you have on any asset 
transfers for Goods/Services, 
please?” Finian asked. 

The elderly gentleman did not 
so much as blink. He hesitated 
only a moment as the index sys- 
tem in his sick skull, instilled by 
hypnolearning, turned over record 
after invisible record. Finally he 
said vacantly, “No asset trans- 
fers.” 

“Nothing in the way of stock, 
even?” 

“No asset transfers, no asset 
transfers.” 

“Thank you, that’s all.” 

But the man had already de- 
parted, needing no thanks. Finian 
turned to the console again won- 
dering whether he could endure 
as many days as it might take: 

“Let me have the volume cov- 
ering Goods/Services corporation 
for 1975.” 

A TOTAL of eighteen hours 
went by, relieved only by 
three short naps aboveground, 
Finian sleeping in a magnolia bush 
on Rolla’s outskirts, before he 
found what he wanted. 

He’d worked through Goods/ 
Services from its 1969 inception 
to 1997, interviewing assorted 



178 



GALAXY 



madmen and women who shuffled 
in, reeled off figures and names or 
lack of them, then shuffled back 
out. Asset transfers exhausted it- 
self as a lead. He tried register or 
directorship as well as deposition 
of tangible real-estate sale. Use- 
less, useless. Only then did it slip 
back. 

In some dim time in the past 
— Pushkyn had mentioned it 
once — public stock of G/S had 
been called off the market. 

Once more he began with a 
different set of volumes, working 
his way down the years. In 1992 
he located it: All certificates de- 
deemed. 

The scent overpowered the 
must of the underground box like 
the smell of blood. He called out 
the volume covering Things to 
Come Incorporated for the same 
year. It was a naturalized Jap- 
anese weighing close to three 
hundred pounds. 

One month after the G/S re- 
demption came a callback by the 
board of TTIC. Finian almost 
wished the poor Japanese could 
appreciate tea. He’d have bought 
him a bucket, had he the money. 

Tensely his fingers flew to the 
console. 

“Two volumes, please. For 
1992 and 1993. Covering Flota- 
tions without tangible assets.” 

When 1992 arrived (a mulatto 
with his face fixed in a perpetual 
grin) Finian was disappointed. 



Nothing. The volume for 1993 (a 
strikingly voluptuous redhaired 
girl who had eyes that made him 
think hauntingly of Dolly) was 
another case entirely. Finian 
trembled: 

“Give me what you have on 
holding companies, please.” 

The third was it, the redhead 
staring through him: 

“Holders Limited. Ten thou- 
sand shares privately issued.” 
Finian was on his feet, sweat- 
ing, his empty belly a-churn. 
“Officers, please.” 

“Chairman of the board, Alvah 
Pharoh.” 

“There must be some mistake. 
Uh — recheck, please. What is 
the name?” 

“Full legal name Alvah Robert 
Loudermilk Pharoh.” 

A florid old gentleman with 
dewlaps and blue, vaguely 
crossed — by heaven! 

Finian almost forgot to return 
the volume to its detention cell 
after he got the names of the 
other registered corporate execu- 
tives, which meant nothing to 
him. But Alvah Robert Louder- 
milk Pharoh most certainly did. 

Finian wondered, as he left the 
National Record building and 
turned his face east again, what 
had possessed the old man to 
think it safe to occasionally ap- 
pear as head of both companies. 
Not that he appeared often, mind 
you. The painting must have been

a slip. So too the appearance on 
the hydrofoiler, displeasing his 
underlings. Senility? Senility and 
a strength that had refused to 
completely drain away, as the 
dewlaps lengthened? 

Hungry and tattered though he 
was, Finian felt renewed as he 
threw himself into the weary 
tramp back to Manhattan. The 
flick-blade knife armed him. So 
did the knowledge that even the 
most mighty, even those who kept 
the plant running at all costs, in- 
cluding the cost of sloth, could 
occasionally slip. 

And they still had Dolly. 

V 

A HEAD in the gloomy purple 
twilight, giant rats were 
squealing after blood. 

Quickening his step, Finian un- 
shipped the flick-knife. Making 
headway was hard. This particu- 
lar section of the Hudson Bluffs 
National Dump was a miniature 
mountain range of discarded but 
eminently serviceable — except 
for the usual ‘engineered-to-fail 
tubes and cracked cabinets — 
solido sets. To the east behind the 
rubble the towers of Manhattan 
Prison thrust into the darkening 
sky. 

Finian walked rapidly away 
from the squee-squee of the rats. 
He’d glimpsed a pack of them 
earlier, down by the Tunnel at 



the far end of the hundred-thou- 
sand-acre junk tract. They were 
nearly three feet long from drink- 
ing the waste spewed out by the 
pharmaceutical factories upriver. 
Hoping to avoid a meeting with 
needly fangs, Finian was suddenly 
arrested by a fresh sound. 

A human voice, in fright. 

He doubled back in his tracks, 
cold sweat all over him. The vita- 
minized beasts were attacking a 
real person! 

Finian rounded a solido heap. 
A little wisp-haired balloon of a 
man in a ragged gray smock was 
backed against a trash peak, try- 
ing vainly to swing at three of 
the rats, armed only with a plastic 
leg broken from a solido console. 
The man’s left trouser leg was 
shredded, black-shining with 
blood. The blood maddened the 
rats. They danced and snapped 
and squee-squeed and made the 
little man even more pale. 

Finian snatched up a solido 
cabinet and heaved. One of the 
rats yipped, turned and scuttled 
at Finian like a small furry tank. 
Shaking, Finian stood his ground. 
He tried to dodge the creature’s 
leap but was not agile enough. 
Hellish teeth sank into his arm. 

Finian jammed his flick-knife 
into the smelly hair at the base 
of the rat’s brain. Squirting blood 
like a fountain, the rat flipped 
over in the air and gave a death- 
squee. Its comrades received solid 



THE SELLERS OF THE DREAM 



181 



whacks between the eyes from the 
other man. They turned tail and 
vanished. 

“Let me see that arm,” said the 
man, a filthy spe'cter with moist, 
disappointed eyes. “Oh, not good 
at all. Come along. I’m a doctor. 
Humphrey Cove.” 

Finian gaped as he was lead 
along the bluff. “A doctor? In the 
National Dump?” 

“I live here. Never mind, I’ll 
explain later. I have a shack. 
Hurry, we don’t want those rat 
toxins to run through you. I think 
I have immunization. Oh, I was 
really done for until you came 
along.” 

The small doctor giggled as he 
hustled Finian along. Finian was 
not too sure he approved of his 
would-be savior. In spite of Dr. 
Cove’s rather pitiful mien, there 
was a certain unsteadiness in his 
wet eyes. He clucked and talked 
to himself as he led the way to 
a ramshackle structure nearly the 
size of a small private dwelling, 
constructed solely of panels from 
solido consoles jerryrigged to- 
gether with wire and other scrap 
materials. 

“No one comes here. No hu- 
mans. Only the littersweep con- 
voys from up and down the coast, 
all mech-driven. The only people 
I ever talk with are the poor juves 
in the prison. What’s your name? 
What are you doing here?” 

At the hovel entrance Cove 



suddenly halted, stared at Finian 
and turned pale. 

“Did you come to arrest — ?” 
Finian shook his head. 

“I came to get into Manhattan.” 
“Via the Dumps?” Cove blinked 
suspiciously. “There’s the Tun- 
nel.” 

“To use the Tunnel, you have to 
be a priest going in for last rites. 
Or a coroner or a psychiatry stu- 
dent. Or have a DOC pass. I 
watched the Tunnel three hours.” 
Suddenly Finian had an impulse 
to trust this odd little person: “I 
have no pass. I’ll be entering the 
prison illegally.” 

“Well, then! Come inside, do 
come inside!” 

N AMES were exchanged again, 
Cove having forgotten he’d 
given his. From behind a triple 
stack of ancient medical texts 
Cove said he’d rescued from 
dump piles, the doctor produced 
a frowsy leather-plas diagnostic 
kit. He clamped the analyzer to 
Finian’s upper arm and switched 
on the battery. A whir. A moment 
later the proper medication had 
been pressure-sprayed through 
Finian’s epidermal cells. 

Cove watched with proud glow- 
ing eyes, saying as he unstrapped 
the unit: 

“A miracle I found this kit, I’ll 
tell you. Three years ago. The 
only persons who use it are the 
poor juves. No regular medical 



182 



GALAXY 



help for them, I’m afraid. So I’ve 
a skiff. Actually an old levacar 
inverted. I paddle across once a 
month after dark.” He giggled. 
“The DOCs at the Tunnel post 
would psych me if I got caught. 
But I feel I’m doing my bit to 
keep the anti-obsols content in 
their unhappiness.” 

Through a rift in the wall 
Cove’s moist eyes sought the 
darkening towers. His voice was 
quickly vengeful. 

“I’d like to see those buildings 
fall to ash. Margarita, ah poor 
Margarita.” He whipped his head 
around eyes almost as vicious as 
those of the rats. “Who are you? 
If this is all a clever trap to 
smoke me out — ” 

“No trap,” Finian assured him. 
“I’ll tell you about it. But do you 
have any food?” 

Cove nodded and fetched a 
brown gallon pharmaceutical bot- 
tle, instructing Finian to drink. 

“Protein and vitamins. Distill it 
myself from the drug sludge in 
the river. After you drink I may 
or may not give you one of the 
soy bars I get from the juves. 
When their wives bear children, 
it’s the only way they can pay, 
you know. They’re very proud, 
always pay.” 

Cove squatted with difficulty, 
an oddly savage little man in the 
fading light. 

“Whether I let you have a soy 
bar depends on your story. If 



you’re an enemy, I can run away 
and leave you to wander the 
Dumps at night. You won’t last 
long with the rats, being a 
stranger.” 

“There’s a woman over on that 
island I have to find,” said Finian, 
and launched out. 

As he recounted his tale, care- 
ful not to become too emotional 
about it, he noticed a growing 
excitement in Cove’s damp eyes. 
Finally, when he had concluded, 
Cove leaped up. 

“Capital, Smith, that’s capital. 
Let me help. Let me ferry you 
across.” 

Finian smiled grudgingly. 
“Okay. I was prepared to swim it.” 
“The sludge would poison you 
before you got halfway.” 

“What’s your stake in this, 
Cove? I mean, this food pays me 
back for the rats.” 

Cove’s little eyes were miser- 
able. 

“Margarita. My wife. She died 
over there.” 

JXAINFULLY the story came 
out, dredged from an unhappy 
past: 

Cove had been a plastic sur- 
geon by specialty, in the employ 
of TTIC at its Bangor Personality 
Salon. But a quirk in his nature 
made him rebel against the work, 
permitted him to fall prey to 
dangerous Galbraither notions. 
His wife had informed on him. 



THE SELLERS OF THE DREAM 



183 



Cove discovered it before the 
TTIC police could arrest him. He 
fled to the outskirts of Bangor, 
hiding there in the woods while 
a few reluctant friends supplied 
him with food. TTIC industrial 
police combed the woods with 
talk-horns, threatening to psych 
his' wife into anti-obsol attitudes if 
he didn’t surrender. 

“The filth!” Cove rocked on his 
haunches. “I thought it was a 
trick, a lever. I ran away. Mar- 
garita, poor thing, was on their 
side. She couldn’t help what she 
did. She came of a respected 
family. TTIC middle manage- 
ment. But a year later I found 
out. They did it anyway. Oh, they 
smile and smile and treat the mob 
kindly. But underneath, when 
they’re opposed — I learned Mar- 
garita had been sentenced to 
Manhattan. It took me another 
nine months to get here and find 
means of crossing. By that time 
she’d died of pneumonia. No anti- 
biotics allowed the juves, you see. 
Juves are worthless. She died.” 
Cove rocked and rocked, wild- 
eyed. “Died, died.” 

“Doctor Cove, will you help me 
get across?” 

“Of course, of course. But to 
hunt that pilot plant, a knife won’t 
be much good. The moment 
you’re discovered they’ll set on 
you like wild dogs.” 

“Then I’ll need something else.” 
Finian’s brain ran rapidly with 



his career with G/S. He recalled 1 : 
Leveranz, an unfortunate opera- 
tive charged with a dangerous 
penetration of the TTIC Market- 
ing Office in Beirut. 

“I knew a man once who was 
bombed. Is there anything 
here — — ?” Finian’s gesture swept 
the shack and dump beyond. “Do 
you remember enough, even if we 
could find an explosive source, to 
bomb me?” 

The moist eyes of Cove wi- 
dened with malicious delight. 
“Blow them up?” 

Now Finian himself felt hard 
and cold. 

“I just might, if they’ve hurt 
her.” 

“Possibly we could use the 
charger pack from an old solido.” 
Cove was warming to the chal- 
lenge. “Yes, we very well might. 
Extremely miniaturized. I’d have 
to check the formula but I think 
I have a chem text in that pile. 
And a military medicine volume, 
too.” He began to tear through 
the books. “No anesthesia, or pre- 
cious little. Perhaps I could knock 
you out.” 

“What for a trigger?” Finian 
questioned. He showed his mouth. 
“I have this empty socket where 
I carried a camera once.” 

Chortling, Cove scuffled among 
his belongings and produced a 
cardboard carton full of ivory 
chips of all sizes. 

“Why, that ought to work,

Smith. The miserable juves aren’t 
fluoridated either. I do quite a 
few extractions. Imagine a plastic 
surgeon doing extractions! Let’s 
see, give me a minute to find the 
chem text . 

Dr. Humphrey Cove unearthed 
the text in two minutes. The rest 
took four days. 

Finian suffered excruciatingly, 
especially during the operation. 
Cove kept smacking him on the 
head with a solido leg when the 
pain grew too hideous. Finian dug 
his nails into his palms and 
thought of murmurous summer 
evenings on the back porch in 
Bala Cynwyd, and vowed in his 
pain-streaked mind the hurt was 
worth it if only he had a means 
to strike at them if they’d hurt 
Dolly, his own Dolly. 

When he was ready to enter the 
prison, his left foot flesh carried a 
small capsule that would detonate 
an explosive force when the yel- 
lowing tooth in his dead socket 
was turned a proper one-half turn 
in its clumsily hand-chiseled 
housing. 

An old trick, bombing. A relic 
of the Triple Play War. But it 
gave Finian a little more courage 
to go hunting death. 

TN AN unpleasant mist-clammy 
-*■ midnight, Dr. Cove paddled 
the improvised skiff through the 
sticky penicillin waste forming a 
crust on the Hudson, to the dilapi- 



dated pier that once belonged to 
the Cunard division of G/S. Off 
down black, ruined streets distant 
reddish lights pulsed. Cove shook 
his hand fervently. 

“I hope you kill them. I hope 
you don’t cooperate and kill them 
all.” 

Then the skiff slithered away 
into the smelly broth. Finian 
shivered and walked. 

Three blocks from the pier a 
ragged band of thirty-odd men 
and women, with a couple of mal- 
nourished youngsters hanging at 
the fringes, slipped out of an alley 
and closed around him. 

They hissed and backed a ter- 
rified Finian against a polybrick 
wall. The leader of the juve pack, 
an oldster of eighty in tapered 
blue denim trousers and an anti- 
quarian jacket spangled with fake 
platinum stars and buckles swag- 
gered up and down, thumbs 
hooked in a six-inch belt. 

“Sending DOCs into the streets 
these days, are they, sonny?” 

“I’m no DOC.” Finian searched 
the hostile eyes for succor. There 
was none. 

“We eat DOCs alive in the pri- 
son. They step off the guard post, 
we swallow ’em up and chew ’em 
to pieces, sonnyboy.” 

“A DOC stew tonight! Oh, wun- 
nerful!” piped a seven-year-old. 

“Scream a little for us, will you 
please?” said the aging juve with 
a smile, shuffling forward.

Finian thought of the flick- 
knife and whipped it out. Another 
sibilant hiss ran from mouth to 
mouth as the blade caught the 
distant red glow. 

“Look, don’t kill me. See this? 
It’s a knife, a real knife. You 
people can recognize a genuine 
useful antique twentieth-century 
artifact, can’t you? Non-obsoles- 
cent. Non-obsolescent, see? Still 
works?” 

A touched stud and the blade 
retracted. Another touch and it 
sprang out. 

“Would I be a DOC and carry 
this?” 

The juve leader had an almost 
religious expression on his face. 
His hand shook as he extended it. 

“Uh — could you — leave 
me see?” 

Finian thrust it into his hand. 

“Yours. Listen, take it.” A dark, 
malicious streak forced out the 
next words. “Could you make 
more? Why don’t you try? Now 
you have a pattern. Then you 
wouldn’t have to wait for the 
DOCs to leave the guard post. 
Then a lot of you could pay them 
a visit.” 

Whispering over their icon, the 
juves melted into the night. 

VI 

T/"EEPING to back streets, 
Finian crossed Bway several 
blocks above a strange complex 



of glittering red lights. Cove had 
told him it was the prison recrea- 
tion area, a kind of open plaza 
known, unpronounceably, as 
Timesq. Hurrying on, he reached 
Parkave. 

Several blocks south he saw 
a white chain working its way 
across the ruined thoroughfare. 
Approaching in the cover of shad- 
ows, he gazed up at a glistening 
glass structure with windows 
painted over. Then he looked 
down to the street again. 

The white chain came apart 
into individual females, double- 
timing along between a cordon of 
TTIC industrial guards. One 
chain rushed west, another east, 
vanishing into the building. 
Finian skulked, grinning mirth- 
lessly, estimating the time to be 
somewhere in the neighborhood 
of eleven at night. Protected, the 
pilot plant nursing staff was 
changing shift. Cove had told 
Finian about the nurses, and also 
what might be done. He hurried 
back toward Bway. 

The recreation area was curi- 
ously deserted of juves at this 
hour. Finian wondered whether 
the flick-knife was really that 
much of a talisman. It must be, 
since he’d seen no juves after the 
first encounter. Cove said there 
were several hundred thousand on 
the island. Perhaps they’d gone 
underground to the ruined trans- 
portation tubes.

Timesq featured open shops 
subsidized out of national taxes 
as a sop to the theory of rehabili- 
tation . antiques, genuine meat- 
burgers, bizarre novelty stores 
where articles were actually dis- 
played on open counters instead 
of behind automated windows. 
But the shops were actually in- 
tended to pander to the vices of 
the juves. Else why would Finian 
have been able to slip so easily 
into a deserted costumer’s? 

Half-starved, his shanks frozen 
by wind whistling under the an- 
cient white uniform and the 
musty gray wig prickling his ears, 
Finian dozed the daylight hours 
away in an alley, blearily on the 
alert for juves. He saw one large 
pack passing a block away, sev- 
eral hundred on the run. They 
didn’t see him. Otherwise he was 
undisturbed until night fell again. 

Midway between the hotel 
which apparently served as 
nurse’s quarters and the ruined 
liquor building, Finian ducked 
into one of the double-timing 
white chains as the eleven o’clock 
shift changed. He hoped his male 
shoes wouldn’t be too noticeable. 
But the street was dark. The 
hundred or so nurses were on 
dangerous extra-pay duty from 
the way they rushed along be- 
tween the guard cordons, not 
speaking, intent only on gaining 
the safety of the pilot plant. 

As in all hospitals, lights 



burned low in the marble mauso- 
leum of a lobby as the nurses 
fanned out to the various tube 
banks. Finian spied a rest room 
next to a boarded-up newsstand, 
slipped inside and waited half an 
hour, out of sight. 

Then he returned to the lobby. 
A late nurse was hurrying to the 
tubes. Outside, the TTIC guard 
cordons were no more. Finian ran 
up behind the nurse, thinking 
smugly that it had been easy so 
far. He’d remembered to touch no 
doors, in case there were a 
sweatprint check. 

r T'HE nurse gave a frightened 
A kkk sound as Finian looped 
his elbow around her neck. 

“Where’s the prototype kept, 
lady? Tell me or I’ll crack you 
in half.” 

“Tw — twelve,” came the pan- 
icky answer. “I can’t breathe!” 
“You won’t ever again unless 
you take me up there.” 

“It’s not my floor — ” 

“With lights out who’ll know? 
There’s the tube. Inside! Don’t 
speak to anyone. Don’t even raise 
an eyebrow, or I’ll throttle you.” 
In the deserted tube the 
alarmed woman, elderly, eyed 
Finian’s wig, all too obvious in the 
full illumination. 

“What are you, some kind of 
degenerate?” 

“Yes, but not the kind you 
think.” 



THE SELLERS OF THE DREAM 



187 



Finian laughed, feeling fright- 
ened and brave all at once. 

On twelve, isolated pools of 
radiance interspersed vast islands 
of aseptic black. Three nurses 
clustered at a floor desk to the 
right. Finian’s terrified victim led 
him to the left. 

Double doors loomed at the far 
corridor end. Why was it so easy? 
Finian felt vague alarm as he 
shoved the old lady through the 
doors. The isolation, that must be 
it, he reasoned. The improbable 
isolation here on Manhattan 
where no investigator would 
dream of looking for a pilot plant. 

Still, Pushkyn’s people had 
discovered it by molecular-tri- 
angulation sonics. Were they 
penetrating even now? 

In the chamber a white blur 
stretched naked in the warm, 
purified air. Finian held tight to 
the old nurse’s arm and ap- 
proached the dreaming girl. The 
raspberry mark stood out black 
in the faint gleam from the half- 
open door of an attached dispen- 
sary. There encephalographs and 
other equipment winked, chromed 
and cold. 

“Dolly?” Finian’s lips felt like 
shreds of paper, crinkled, dry. 
“Dolly, hear me?” 

A vacous mewing sound came 
from the girl. She twisted deeper 
in silk coverlets. 

“Wake her,” Finian ordered. 

“You’re a madman! I don’t 



know how. I’m on six, neuro- 
search.” 

He shoved her rudely. “There 
must be a chart in the dispensary.” 

Finian had to threaten to cuff 
her several times before she 
tremblingly translated the medi- 
cal Latin in the last twelve thick 
casebooks on the dispensary 
shelf. From the section marked 
Emergency Antidotal Procedures 
she read out the correct mix of 
ampoules from the wall-wide 
freezer. 

Finian was acutely conscious of 
the silence of the great dark 
room, the whisper of Dolly’s 
breathing from the bed, the rush 
of controlled air in and out of 
blowers. Time was moving inex- 
orably. What he would do when 
and if he wakened Dolly he was 
not precisely sure. All he could 
tell was that he must talk to her. 
Talking to her once was what he 
had worked and tramped and al- 
most died for. 

The pressuredermic barrel 
gleamed in the light. Finian 
snatched it from the nurse. 

“If you’ve tricked me — I don’t 
take to hurting women, but I 
will!” 

“I swear to Loudermilk I didn’t. 
Only please don’t hurt me.” 

“In there,” Finian instructed. 
He latched the dispensary door 
behind her. There was no visor- 
phone inside. He would be safe 
a moment longer.

W/-ITH SHAKING hands he 
* pressed the instilling cup 
near the raspberry mark, and 
plunged. 

Slowly, slowly, the naked girl 
rolled over, lids fluttering drow- 
sily. Finian crouched by the bed. 
His hand knotted up in the silken 
sheets. He’d turned up a rheostat 
to provide a gleam for judging her 
eyes. Doll-blue, they flew open — 
Blank, unknowing. 

“Why, hello there.” The voice 
tormented him. It was so squeak- 
ing, so silly. “Whatever are you 
doing in Dream’s bedroo — 
Dream’s bed — ” 

Like a broken mechanism the 
voice ran down. One of her volup- 
tuous hands crept tentatively to- 
ward his. 

“Finian?” 

“Oh, my God, my God, Dolly.” 
He buried his head on her 
shoulder, almost crying. 

When he had controlled himself 
sufficiently to talk, he asked her 
what it was like. 

“Not too terrible.” Dolly’s voice 
now, not her body but for the 
mark, only her voice trying pain- 
fully to re-form old associations. 
“When we moved . Well, it 
was luck and a little moral com- 
promise that snared me a chance 
to be the prototype.” 

“Do you remember anything? 

I mean, when you’re under?” 

“A little. A very little. Far down 
in my head, like the bottom of a 



well. I won’t in a week or two, so 
they say.” 

“It’s wrong, Dolly! It’s wrong 
for them to change you!” 

She laughed tolerantly, not a 
little sadly. 

“Those wild old ideas of yours 
again.” 

“ I love you, Dolly. I want you 
the way you were.” 

“Impossible, Fin. My body’s 
changed.” One hand lifted the 
hem of the sheet. “It’s part of the 
price for being the prototype. I 
nearly died when my parents 
made us move. I wasn’t strong. 
I’m not much stronger now. 
Tjhis — ” a gesture to the 
room — “when they’re finished 
with me, in a week or two, I’ll 
never be able to go back. The pro- 
totype can’t. Other women can, 
the change isn’t so deep when it’s 
purchased. But in return I’ll re- 
ceive more money than most 
women ever see. I wish you hadn’t 
come here, Fin. I’d nearly gotten 
over you.” 

“Take out the contacts, Dolly. 
Then tell me it’s all over.” 

“Fin, I can’t. They’re perma- 
nent.” She clutched his arm. “If 
you’re caught here — ” 

Rapidly he told her of what 
he’d learned at the National Rec- 
ord Office. “Some kind of con- 
spiracy, Dolly. Awful, awful. Hell, 
I’m not bright enough to fathom 
what it means. Maybe Pop could 
have. I’m just certain I want you

out before this crazy doublecross 
blows right up.” 

Dolly hesitated. “I’m not sure. 
My mind’s full of someone 
else — ” 

“Don’t let him frighten you,” 
said a voice. “He’s done anyway.” 
Caught, heartbeat wild and 
racing, Finian turne'd as all the 
lights blazed up in the room. 
Dolly shrieked and burrowed 
under the sheet. 

Outside the closing panel Fin- 
ian glimpsed a phalanx of armed 
TTIC police. The three men in- 
side moved swiftly toward him, 
Sprool and Pushkyn shoulder to 
shoulder, and shuffling behind, 
Alvah Robert Loudermilk Pharoh 
with his dewlaps jiggling and his 
blue, vaguely crossed eyes filled 
with fright. 

U\X7 E SHOULD of killed the 
” jerko,” Pushkyn offered. 
“Be quiet.” Sprool breathed 
tightly, thinking hard. 

“No one listens to me,” Alvah 
Robert Loudermilk Pharoh 
whined. “No one listens any more 
even though I’m the chief execu- 
tive of Holders.” 

“You simpleton!” Sprool spun 
on him, barely able to control his 
fury. “You incredible wreck! I 
wish Pushkyn and I had retired 
you to a senility farm long ago. If 
your addled brain could have un- 
derstood it wasn’t safe for you to 
go around making public appear- 



ances! Having your portrait 
painted!” 

“Holders is my firm!” 

“It was. Before your brains 
turned to mashed potatoes,” said 
Pushkyn. 

“You wouldn’t have penetrated 
the pilot plant, would you, Push- 
kyn?” Finian was suddenly en- 
raged, and beginning to under- 
stand. “Even though you knew 
where it was.” 

Pushkyn sneered. “Whaddya v 
think, put sand in the wheels? 
Always the funny finko, huh? If 
it wasn’t for me. Sprool and a few 
others on both sides, running the 
show while this old bonebag sits 
on the Holders board — ” 

“He means to say,” Sprool put 
in, • somewhat sadly, “we have 
done our best to keep the plant 
running. You, Fin, have done your 
best to stop it.” 

“How did you find me?” Fin- 
ian demanded. 

Sprool shrugged. “See-ray.” 

“I never touched a doorknob 
anyplace!” 

“There is a false socket in your 
head. Every person entering or 
leaving this plant is rayed for 
dental coding. Yours failed to 
check. It took a few minutes to 
collect Pushkyn. And the old man. 

I want him to see the fruits of his 
senility. We vertijetted.” 

“Ah, damn,” said Finian, im- 
potently. 

“I very nearly admire you,” 



190 



GALAXY 



Sprool told him. “In proper cir- 
cumstances you might have filled 
a responsible position with 
Holders. Do you realize what a 
difficult and exciting enterprise it 
is to run this world, Fin?” 

“I realize you sold everybody a 
bill of goods, kept them soft, 
sucked their guts out.” 

“Would you rather have howl- 
ing millions out of work and riot- 
ing?” 

“Yes! Yes. I mean, no. I don’t 
want people to starve, but this 
way — I’d rather have some guts 
in life. Trouble and guts.” 

“Trouble we have, Finian,” 
Sprool returned with a sigh. “Do 
you know what we saw as we 
came over the Tunnel in the 
vertijet? The DOC post in ruins. 
The juves are breaking out, Fin, 
actually breaking out. Most of 
them are dead, of course. But sev- 
eral hundred escaped. There’s a 
pitched battle going on in Jersey 
this minute. The juves will die as 
soon as I give the mobilization 
order. A few may get away and 
start in other cities, inciting to 
riot, pulling down what we’ve 
built so carefully to insure every- 
one a decent life. Both TTIC and 
G/S are alerting industrial guards 
trained for trouble such as this. 
We’ll also have to apply consid- 
erable pressure for the DOCs to 
move. But we’ll win. We gave up 
war long ago, Fin. We won’t per- 
mit another to start.” 



“The creeps had knives!” Push- 
kyn bellowed. “Real knives! You 
stupid, did you — ?” 

“I think so,” Finian looked up. 
“I hope so.” 

A GAIN Sprool sighed, almost 
sympathetically. 

“Fin, Fin. You seem to think 
we’re evil men. We’re not. We’re 
businessmen. We didn’t begin the 
system. We only inherited it. But 
you’ve never understood, have 
you? Always, I think, you re- 
sented us as a result of what your 
father taught you.” Sprool was 
white now, impassioned. “We had 
no choice! Either we maintained 
calm or — ” 

“You changed Dolly! I don’t 
understand your theories beyond 
that!” 

Sprool outshouted him: “The 
alternative to a rocked boat is 
chaos!” 

“There’s got to be another 
way.” 

“Go to the guard post! See the 
mangled bodies and then say 
that.” 

“I don’t care, Sprool! I’m taking 
Dolly off the island.” 

“Creep, you won’t set one foot 
from here.” 

Finian peeled his lips back. 

“Look at the tooth, Lyman. 
You know what was there before.” 
He waggled his left foot. “I’m 
bombed. The tooth will set it off. 
Either instantaneously or on

timed delay. Stop me from walk- 
ing out with Dolly and find out.” 

“Salinghams wanted my por- 
trait — ” the florid old gentleman 
began. 

“Bluffer! Lousy, rotten bluffer!” 
Screaming, Pushkyn rushed for- 
ward. 

Sprool’s hand flew up. 

“Don’t! I believe him.” . 

For the first time Finian Smith 
saw Sprool perspiring. 

“He’s the kind to do it, Push- 
kyn. I don’t want slaughter here, 
too. So you keep quiet and re- 
member who’s senior trouble- 
shooter.” 

Cold, shrewd lights glittered in 
Sprool’s eyes. “Fin, what guaran- 
tee can you offer if we release this 
woman to you, allow her to go 
with you under duress?” 

“No.” 

Heads swung, startled. Dolly 
went on slowly: 

“I think — I want — ” 

A disgusted sigh came from 
Sprool’s lips. He controlled him- 
self. “Very well, Fin. If we permit 
you to leave, what guarantees do 
you offer that you’ll cause no 
further trouble? We’ll have our 
hands full quelling the disturb- 
ances the juves will start. It hasn’t 
gotten too far out of hand yet. 
But if I don’t give the mobiliza- 
tion order, it could go nationwide. 
Even to other countries. I have to 
be around to stop it. It can be 
done, even though I don’t much 



like removing the velvet glove.” 
“Guarantees?” said Finian. “My 
word. That’s all.” 

Sprool walked quickly to the 
door and opened it. The threat- 
ening knot of industrial police still 
waited in the shadows. Finian 
bundled Dolly into the bedclothes 
and moved her toward the en- 
trance as Sprool said, “Let him 
pass.” 

“I won’t stand for it!” Pushkyn 
leaped forward and landed a solid 
one that rocked Finian on his 
heels. Then Sprool snapped his 
fingers. The TTIC police carried 
the foam-lipped Pushkyn into the 
dispensary. 

T rembling, suddenly cold 

and trembling clear through, 
Finian made an effort to keep his 
face an inflexible mask as he 
guided Dolly through the aisle 
between the guards. He hoped she 
wouldn’t question him, wouldn’t 
relent until they were free. Sick 
fear engulfed him as he touched 
the tip of his tongue gingerly to 
the fake tooth while the tube shot 
down. 

Dolly leaned on his shoulder, 
her hair warm. She made fright- 
ened mewing sounds. Finian shep- 
herded her into the night, began 
the long, terrible walk to the 
Tunnel, hoping she wouldn’t come 
to her senses until they reached 
the opposite shore. In time she’d 
be herself again. That much he 



192 



GALAXY 



could give her even if his search 
had been all for nothing. 

The DOC post at the Tunnel 
entrance was afire. Juve corpses 
sprawled everywhere. 

Midway along the empty tun- 
nel Finian halted. A figure ca- 
pered toward them. 

“Capital, oh, marvelous!” Hum- 
phrey Cove trilled, stepping over 
a dead DOC’s open-mouthed 
head. “Three hundred of them got 
out, running for their lives. I think 
it will spread this time. The local 
camps, the jobless — full-scale! 
There are so many really lovely 
pockets of resistance!” 

“Shut up and walk.” Finian 
pushed Cove back toward the 
Jersey side. 

“What in heaven’s name is 
wrong with you, Smith?” 

“Armed.” Finian whispered it 
so Dolly couldn’t hear. “A guy hit 
me, I’m armed. Can’t have more 
than half an hour before I blow. 
Cove, don’t you say anything. 
When we’re outside, you take care 
of this girl, understand? Watch 
out for her until she recovers. 
She’s free of them, I bought her 
that much.” 

They passed a shrilling visor- 
phone in a lighted kiosk at the 
far Tunnel mouth. A DOC alert 
was being scheduled for Philadel- 
phia. Juve gangs were forming in 
the streets there, hand-made 
knives were appearing. The mask 
was off. Full mobilization of com- 



bined TTIC and G/S industrial 
police was being ordered by 
Sprool. Cove clapped his hands. 

Rain was falling as Finian led 
Dolly, out of the Tunnel. Three 
DOC vertijets from the south 
were homing on Manhattan, a- 
gleam with emergency lights. 
Dolly murmured. Finian lifted 
her chin and stared into the doll- 
blue eyes a moment, conscious of 
the bomb working, working to- 
ward detonation in the flesh of his 
foot. He couldn’t even feel the 
death seed. Wasn’t that a joke? 

“Cove’ll take care of you,” 
Finian said. He kissed her. Be- 
wildered, Dolly called for him as 
he turned and walked rapidly 
away, not seeing the rain or the 
littered bodies. 

He had gone but a dozen steps 
when something felled him and 
brought the dark. 

T)AIN, incredible pain was his 
first sensation. 

Then a warmth of flesh. Dolly 
bending over him. Through a 
slatted section of solido panel he 
saw vertijets winking over Man- 
hattan. Finian wriggled, then 
struggled up, screaming: 

“My leg . what happened?” 

Crying, Dolly pressed him 
down. 

“Cove did it. Cove operated. 
He hates them, Fin. He hates 
TTIC. Something about his wife. 
He said you ought to live, even

with — I wish my mind would 
straighten out. I can’t say things 
all right yet.” 

Finian fought the terror, the 
dull-fire agony. “Where is he?” 

Dolly shuddered. “He packed it 
in a valise and ran for the Tun- 
nel.” 

In a burst of fire the center of 
Manhattan Prison blew up. 

When the reverberations and 
Dolly’s screams had stopped, the 
two of them clung together, listen- 
ing to the hysterical automatic 
sirens at both ends of the island 
wailing as they hadn’t wailed 
since the Triple Play War. Con- 
fused, hurting, glad of life, guilty 
and fearsomely glad and yet sick- 



ened by the suddenly-swarming 
sky full of vertijets, their flaring 
emergency lights promising vio- 
lence, violence across the land, 
violence maybe everywhere, Fin- 
ian clutched the girl to his 
shoulder and stared at the inferno 
of the prison island. 

“My God, I think I started a 
war, Dolly. Sprool said — I didn’t 
mean to start — ” 

The words tore out of him, al- 
most animal: “Is this the only 
way?” 

Dolly sobbed. There wasn’t any 
other answer, except the sirens 
multiplying all around in the dis- 
rupted night.

FORECAST 

Next issue's cover is a hot and lively spectacle by Dember. When you 
see it your first thought is likely to be, "Mercury?", and your second, "no, 
of course not — not with an atmosphere!" Well, you shouldn't take any- 
thing for granted. It is Mercury. For the purposes of this story, anyway, it 
does have an atmosphere — and if you want to know how come, we refer 
you to the story itself. The title is Hot Planet. The author is one who isn't 
in the habit of making technical blunders . and who, by the way, also 
wrote The Green World for the current issue of our companion magazine, 
/f. His name: Hal Clement. This marks his return to Galaxy after an absence 
of more than a decade . one more milestone in our endless endeavor to 
bring back the best established writers and to locate the most promising 
new ones. 

Naturally there's more in the issue — Willy Ley; the conclusion of Cliff 
Simak's fine Here Gather the Stars . and a little "non-fact" item that we 
think you'll like. The title is The Great Nebraska Sea. It isn't fact today 
— but who knows whether it will be by the time our August issue goes on 
sale?
