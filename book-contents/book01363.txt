Readers write — and wrong! 


THIS MONTH’S nomination for the 
most gratifying piece of mail goes to 
the following: 

Dear Sir: 

For the editorial in your issue of 
November, 1969 (Galaxy), three cheers . 

With my respects. 

Very truly yours, 
Stanley Katz 
Professor 
School of Engineering and 
Architecture 
City College, N. Y. 

The response to the November Gal- 
axy and December If editorials ( Brain 
Pollution and Skintelligence, respec- 
tively and dealing with the undemon- 
strated correlation between skin color 
and intelligence) has been beautiful, 
pro and con, and suggests that people 
as a species might yet make it. 

Among the most edifying is the next: 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

It is interesting to note how Camp- 
bell absolutely refuses to accept statis- 
tical evidence connecting smoking with 


cancer and heart disease, and yet uses 
it without qualms in the area of IQ 
which is a very ill-defined concept at 
best. The definition of IQ as that which 
IQ tests measure is about as useful as 
any, although in college Prof. Russel 
Ackoff (then Director of Operations 
Research at Case) defined it as the sec- 
ond partial derivative of knowledge 
with respect to changes in environment 
and time. That sounds impressive, but 
just try to use it. I suspect that if you 
compared the average IQ’s of any two 
groups, you would find a difference; 
and probably could decide in advance 
which group you wanted to score best 
badly biased. Individual variations 
within each group would be far greater 
than the difference between the groups. 
Actually, variations within a single 
person can be quite large. All of us 
have fields of knowledge which we ab- 
sorb very readily, and others which we 
can’t get into our thick heads no mat- 
ter how hard we try. Since IQ is sup- 
posed to be a measure of how easily we 
learn, a test can be very easily biased. 
I, personally, have been tested with

TELEMART 

She was unfaithful unto 



death — but not her own! 


25 


F OUR days after the honey- 
moon Ted Trymble came 
home from golf and found his wife 
had been unfaithful to him. The 
evidence was there — right outside 
his front door — for all the world 
to see. 

“Why did you do it, Maggie?” 
he demanded, setting his clubs 
down in a corner with exaggerated 
care. 

He kept his face immobile and 
his voice crisp, pretending to be 
not unduly shocked, though in- 
wardly he was praying to hear it 
was all a mistake. 

But Maggie smiled her calm, 
careless smile and shrugged. 

“It was just an impulse,” she 
said. “An irresistible impulse.” 

Ted went to the window and 
eyed the evidence. The black Tur- 
bo-Cadillac was almost as long 
as the house and its haunches 
gleamed in the late afternoon sun 
like those of a panther about to 
spring. So she was admitting it, 
just like that. 

“Maggie,” he said reasonably. 
“Everybody gets that kind of im- 
pulse now and then. One simply 
has to learn to control it.” 

“I can’t,” she replied blandly. 
“When I find something I like — ^1 
buy it.” 

“I see.” 

Ted strode into the kitchen, 
took a beer bulb from the refriger- 
ator and squirted some of the 
frothy liquid into his mouth. He 
sat down in the cool seclusion of 


the dining alcove to consider the 
matter of his wife’s dereliction. 
Maggie’s parents had left her an 
estate of some quarter of a million 
— Ted knew the sum to a penny 
but preferred to think in round 
numbers — the income from which 
was just enough to maintain Ted 
and her in modest comfort for the 
rest of their lives. When they be- 
came engaged the agreement was 
that the capital would be kept in- 
tact. Ted was a personable young 
man and knew he could probably 
have married real money but he 
had exchanged his boyish hopes of 
some day owning a private air- 
plane and yacht for the certitude 
of never having to work. And he 
had been prepared to stick to the 
bargain because marriage was, in 
his opinion, still a sacred cove- 
nant. 

The trouble was that Maggie ap- 
peared not to share his high sense 
of principle. She had just blown a 
noticeable fraction of their liveli- 
hood in one afternoon. A pang of 
anguish caused Ted’s fingers to 
clamp inward on the plastic bulb 
and a wavering stream of beer 
leaped across the kitchen. He com- 
posed himself with an effort and 
went back into the lounge. 

“I forgive you this time, Mag- 
gie,” he said stiffly. “I guess it 
won’t do any harm for me to be 
seen in a better car but you must 
promise not to betray our wed- 
ding vows again.” 

“Of course, honey.”

IF 



Maggie spoke with a lack of ef- 
fort Ted found disturbing and she 
went on flicking the glowing pages 
of a tri-di magazine. 

Two days later he came home 
from a morning’s workout in the 
gymnasium to find that his fears 
had been well founded. Maggie 
was sporting a bracelet of genuine 
green-veined Venusian gold cost- 
ing roughly ten times as much as 
its counterpart in Earth gold 
would have. 

“I promised not to buy another 
car,” was her defense. “This isn’t 
another car, is it? It doesn’t look 
much like a car to me.’’ 

She flirted her wrist in his face 
and the bracelet’s chunky links 
clicked like the action of a well- 
oiled rifle. 

“It isn’t a car,” Ted agreed, 
“but it’s something we can afford 
even less. What about our invest- 
ments?” 

“This is an investment. Isn’t 
gold an investment?” 

“Not that kind. Don’t you ever 
read the financial pages? Don’t 
you know that big nuclear pow- 
ered ships have just been proved 
out on the Venus and Mars hauls? 
The cost of Venusian gold at the 
moment is ninety per cent freight 
charge but by this time next year 
it’ll be as common as dirt.” 

Maggie sniffed disbelievingly. 
“Well, I was bored sitting here 
by myself. Other girls’ husbands 
stay at home with them.” 

“Bored?” Ted was aghast. “You 


absolutely seem to forget _that 
when those other guys are swan- 
ning round the house watching 
television and getting fat — I’m 
working hard to build up health. 
That’s a marriage partner’s most 
important duty — to keep himself 
healthy.” 

“Oh, Jesus,” Maggie whispered. 
“What have I done?” 

Three days later, while Ted was 
surfing, she bought a luminous 
mink costing as much as the car 
and the bracelet put together. Ted 
examined the price tag, then went 
into the kitchen, took a beer bulb 
in each hand and expended them 
in a foaming orgasm of fury. When 
calmness returned he went back to 
the lounge and greeted his wife 
with a numb smile. 

“It has just occurred to me that 
I’ve been neglecting you a little, 
Maggie. Let’s go out tonight and 
see what we can do about hitting 
the town.” 

Maggie’s eyes flickered with 
enthusiasm. She hurried away to 
engage in lengthy cosmetic rituals 
and that night she really did hit the 
town. When she was too full of as- 
sorted liquors to be aware of what 
was happening, Ted pushed her out 
through the window of their third- 
floor bedroom. 

T HE fall did not kill Maggie 
but the damage to her lower 
spine was such that she was con- 
fined to a wheelchair for life. As 
the Trymbles’ house was tall and

narrow — with a steep flight of 
steps at the door — Ted felt that his 
wife was as good as dead. She 
could not, at any rate, get to the 
expensive stores, where she would 
be tempted to further acts of in- 
fidelity. 

With a minimum of prompting 
from him she sold the car and the 
coat at a relatively small loss but 
insisted on retaining the bracelet 
of green-veined Venusian gold. 

“What’s the point of keeping 
it?” he pleaded. “I mean, you 
don’t even go out now.” 

“It’s company for me. Some- 
thing I can look at.” 

“But there must be more in- 
teresting things to look at — how 
about a television set?” 

To Ted’s surprise, his wife 
showed interest in the suggestion. 

“If I sell the bracelet will you get 
me a set?” 

“Of course, sweetie.” 

“Any kind of a television set?” 
He sensed the trap immediately 
but in his mind’s eye he could see 
the big nuclear-powered ships 
speeding toward Earth with car- 
goes of cheaper Venusian gold and 
he decided play along. 

“Any kind of set you want, 
Maggie. You know how bad I feel 
about you being tied to that chair 
all the time.” 

“That’s nice of you, honey. I’d 
like a Telemart Three.” 

Ted swallowed unhappily. He 
detested television as an opiate 
which sapped a man’s strength of 


body and mind — he even had an 
aversion to reading about technical 
developments in the field. But he 
knew about the Telemart Three. 

The set was ordered that day 
and Ted’s uphappiness increased 
as he watched the technicians posi- 
tion the eight-foot proscenium and 
arch at one end of the lounge. 
Working with blunt efficiency 
they ripped out the floor below 
the proscenium and ran a mass of 
cables, conduits and wave guides 
down to the raw materials tank 
they were installing in the base- 
ment. Four hours later the job was 
completed and a Telemart sales 
exec formally presented Maggie 
with a white-and-gold brochure. 
He then placed the remote control 
set in her hand with the air of an 
English archbishop conferring the 
orb and sceptre of his sovereign. 

“This is your on-off switch and 
channel selector,” he said, address- 
ing himself intensely to Maggie 
and ignoring Ted. He moved the 
switch and a pretty girl in a silver 
dress appeared on the proscenium, 
singing in the low voice of a French 
diseuse. The only way in which she 
could be distinguished from real 
flesh-and-blood was a slight ten- 
dency to glow, which made her 
brighter than the other people in 
the room. 

“Oops,” the sales exec said. “If 
the image is too bright you do 
this.” He moved a knob and the 
girl dimmed to normalcy. 

“It’s wonderful,” Maggie

IF 



breathed. “When do we get the 
commercials?” 

“You shouldn’t have long to 
wait,” the exec said benignly, his 
eyes gleaming behind old-fash- 
ioned homrims. A few seconds 
later the silver girl finished her 
song and vanished, to be replaced 
by a handsome, tanned man in 
beachwear. He reclined on a sun 
chair on a shockingly real area of 
honey-colored sand and in his 
hand was a dewy-cold bottle of 
Tingle-lime. Ted started involun- 
tarily — he could actually smell 
sea air mingled with the keen tang 
of the soft drink. He examined the 
small orifices in the edge of the 
proscenium, looking for visible 
signs of gas being emitted. 

He saw nothing. 

“ . why don’t you join me?” 
the image was saying. “Join me 
now.” 

“Shall I?” Maggie asked ex- 
citedly. 

“Only if you can use some Tin- 
gle-lime.” the exec replied. “We 
urge all our clients to buy only 
what they really need.” 

“We drink lots of Tingle- 
lime.” 

“No, we don’t Ted put in. 

He was too late. Maggie had 
pressed the “accept” button on her 
handset and a crate of a dozen 
king-size Tingle-limes appeared, 
amid a faint ozonic crackling, on 
the small catwalk attached to the 
front of the proscenium. The exec 
lifted the crate, carried it to Mag- 


gie’s chair and with a flourish 
opened one of the plastic bottles. 

Maggie took it and sipped the 
green liquid eagerly. 

“It’s perfect — even better than 
the stuff we get at the store.” 

“It ought to be. Anything you 
buy in a store is bound to have 
been on the shelves for some time, 
possibly months, but goods you 
buy through Telemart Three are 
created specially for you on the 
instant of purchase.” 

“How can that be?” Ted felt he 
had been silent too long. “As I 
understand it, there has to be a 
crate of Tingle-limes at the broad- 
casting station. It gets scanned 
with Roentgen rays and the details 
of its molecular structure are 

V 

broadcast on a separate channel 
from the one which carries the pro- 
grams and commercials. Right?” 
“That’s true, but — ” 

“If someone presses the ‘accept’ 
button, the molecular blueprint 
coming through al that time is 
used to build up a replica of the 
transmitted object from the raw 
materials bank in the basement. 
Right?” 

“Right again, but — ” 

“So how do we know the ori- 
ginal crate of pop hasn’t been ly- 
ing on a shelf at the station, possi- 
bly for months?” 

“You know because the Tele- 
mart Corporation stands on its 
word as given in this brochure,” 
the exec said in a hurt voice. He

H E WALKED the hills and by time and weather out of the 

knew what the hills had seen cliff’s sheer face. He lived alone on 

through geologic time. He listened a worn-out farm perched on a high 
to the stars and spelled out what and narrow ridge that overlooked 

the stars were saying. He had the confluence of two rivers. And 

found the creature that lay im- his next-door neighbor, a most ill- 

prisoned in the stone. He had favored man, drove to the county 

climbed the tree that in other days seat, thirty miles away, to tell the 


31 


sheriff that this reader of the hills, 
this listener to the stars was a 
chicken thief. 

T HE sheriff dropped by within 
a week or so and walked 
across the yard to where the man 
was sitting in a rocking chair on a 
porch that faced the river hills. The 
sheriff came to a halt at the foot of 
the stairs that ran up to the porch. 

“I’m Sheriff Harley Shepherd,” 
he said. “I was just driving by. 
Been some years since I been out 
in this neck of the woods. You are 
new here, aren’t you?” 

The man rose to his feet and 
gestured at another chair. “Been 
here three years or so,” he said. 
“The name is Wallace Daniels. 
Come up and sit with me.” 

The sheriff climbed the. stairs 
and the two shook hands, then sat 
down in the chairs. 

“You don’t farm the place,” the 
sheriff said. 

The weed-grown fields came up 
to the fence that hemmed in the 
yard. 

Daniels shook his head. “Sub- 
sistence farming, if you can call it 
that. A few chickens for eggs. A 
couple of cows for milk and butter. 
Some hogs for meat — the neigh- 
bors help me butcher. A garden, of 
course, but that’s about the story.” 
“Just as well,” the sheriff said. 
“The place is all played out. Old 
Amos Williams, he let it go to ruin. 
He never was no farmer.” 

“The land is resting now,” said 


Daniels. “Give it ten years— twen- 
ty might be better — and it will 
ready once again. The only things 
it’s good for now are the rabbits 
and the woodchucks and the mead- 
ow mice. A lot of birds, of course. 
I’ve got the finest covey of quail a 
man has ever seen.” 

“Used to be good squirrel coun- 
try,” said the sheriff. “Coon, too. I 
suppose you still have coon. You a 
hunter, Mr. Daniels?” 

“I don’t own a gun,” said Dan- 
iels. 

The sheriff settled deeply into the 
chair, rocking gently. 

“Pretty country out here,” he 
declared. “Especially with the 
leaves turning colors. A lot of 
hardwood and they are colorful. 
Rough as all hell, of course, this 
land of yours. Straight up and 
down, the most of it. But pretty.” 
“It’s old country,” Daniels said. 
“The last sea retreated from this 
area more than four hundred mil- 
lion years ago. It has stood as dry 
land since the end of the Silurian. 
Unless you go up north, onto the 
Canadian Shield, there aren’t 
many places in this country you 
can find as old as this.” 

“You a geologist, Mr. Daniels?” 
“Not really. Interested, is all. 
The rankest amateur. I need some- 
thing to fill in my time and I do a 
lot of hiking, scrambling up and 
down these hills. And you can’t do 
that without coming face to face 
with a lot of geology. I got inter- 
ested. Found some fossil brachio- 


32 


IF 



pods and got to wondering about 
them. Sent off for some books and 
read up on them. One thing led to 
another and — ” 

“Brachiopods? Would they be 
dinosaurs, or what? I never knew 
there were dinosaurs out this way.” 

“Not dinosaurs,” said Daniels. 
“Earlier than dinosaurs, at least 
the ones I found. They’re small. 
Something like clams or oysters. 
But the shells are hinged in a differ- 
ent sort of way. These were old 
ones, extinct millions of years ago. 
But we still have a few brachiopods 
living now. Not too many of 
them.” 

“It must be interesting.” 

“I find it so,” said Daniels. 

“You knew old Amos Willi- 
ams?” 

“No. He was dead before I came 
here. Bought the land from the 
bank that was settling his estate.” 

Q UEER old coot,” the sheriff 
said. “Fought with all his 
neighbors. Especially with Ben 
Adams. Him and Ben had a line 
fence feud going on for years. Ben 
said Amos refused to keep up the 
fence. Amos claimed Ben knocked 
it down and then sort of, careless- 
like, hazed his cattle over into 
Amos’s hayfield. How you get 
along with Ben?” 

“All right,” Daniels said. “No 
trouble. I scarcely know the man.” 
“Ben don’t do much farming, 
either,” said the sheriff. “Hunts 
and fishes, hunts ginseng, does 


some trapping in the winter. Pros- 
pects for minerals now and then.” 
“There are minerals in these 
hills,” said Daniels. “Lead and 
zinc. But it would cost more to get 
it out than it would be worth. At 
present prices, that is.” 

“Ben always has some scheme 
cooking,” said the sheriff. “Always 
off on some wild goose chase. And 
he’s a pure pugnacious man. Al- 
ways has his nose out of joint about 
something. Always on the prod for 
trouble. Bad man to have for an 
enemy. Was in the other day to say 
someone’s been lifting a hen or two 
of his. You haven’t been missing 
any, have you?” 

Daniels grinned. “There's a fox 
that levies a sort of tribute on the 
coop every now and then. I don’t 
begrudge them to him.” 

“Funny thing,” the sheriff said. 
“There ain’t nothing can rile up a 
farmer like a little chicken steal- 
ing. It don’t amount to shucks, of 
course, but they get real hostile at 
it.” 

“If Ben has been losing chick- 
ens,” Daniels said, “more than 
likely the culprit is my fox.” 

“Your fox? You talk as if you 
own him.” 

“Of course I don’t. No one 
owns a fox. But he lives in these 
hills with me. I figure we are neigh- 
bors. I see him every now and then 
and watch him. Maybe that means 
I own a piece of him. Although I 
wouldn’t be surprised if he watches 
me more than I watch him. He

moves quicker than I do.” 

The sheriff heaved himself out of 
the chair. 

“I hate to go,” he said. “I de- 
clare it has been restful sitting here 
and talking with you and looking 
at the hills. You look at them a lot, 
I take it.” 

“Quite a lot,” said Daniels. 

i 

H E SAT on the porch and 
watched the sheriffs car top 
the rise far down the ridge and dis- 
appear from sight. 

What had it all been about? He 
wondered. The sheriff hadn’t just 
happened to be passing by. He’d 
been on an errand. All his aimless, 
friendly talk had not been for noth- 
ing and in the course of it he’d 
managed to ask lots of questions. 

Something about Ben Adams, 
maybe? Except there wasn’t too 
much against Adams except he was 
bone-lazy. Lazy in a weasely sort 
of way. Maybe the sheriff had got- 
ten wind of Adam’s off-and-on 
moonshining operation and was 
out to do some checking, hoping 
that some neighbor might misspeak 
himself. None of them would, of 
course, for it was none of their 
business, really, and the moonshin- 
ing had built up no nuisance value. 
What little liquor Ben might make 
didn’t amount to much. He was 
too lazy for anything he did to 
amount to much. 

From far down the hill he heard 
the tinkle of a bell. The two cows 


were finally heading home. It must 
be much later, Daniels told him- 
self, than he had thought. Not that 
he paid much attention to what 
time it was. He hadn’t for long 
months on end, ever since he’d 
smashed his watch when he’d fallen 
off the ledge. He had never both- 
ered to have the watch fixed. He 
didn’t need a watch. There was a 
battered old alarm clock in the 
kitchen but it was an erratic piece 
of mechanism and not to be relied 
upon. He paid slight attention to it. 

In a little while, he thought, he’d 
have to rouse himself and go and 
do the chores — milk the cows, feed 
the hogs and chickens, gather up 
the eggs. Since the garden had been 
laid by there hadn’t been much to 
do. One of these days he’d have to 
bring in the squashes and store 
them in the cellar and there were 
those three or four big pumpkins 
he’d have to lug down the hollow 
to the Perkins kids, so they’d have 
them in time to make jack-o-lan- 
terns for Hallowe’en. He won- 
dered if he should carve out the 
faces himself or if the kids would 
rather do it on their own. 

But the cows were still quite a 
distance away and he still had 
time. He sat easy in his chair and 
stared across the hills. 

And they began to shift and 
change as he stared. 

When he had first seen it, the 
phenomenon had scared him silly. 
But now he was used to it. 

As he watched, the hills changed

into different ones. Different vege- 
tation and strange life stirred on 
them. 

H E SAW dinosaurs this time. 

A herd of them, not very big 
ones. Middle Triassic, more than 
likely. And this time it was only a 
distant view — he, himself, was not 
to become involved. He would 
only see, from a distance, what 
ancient time was like and would 
not be thrust into the middle of it 
as most often was the case. 

He was glad. There Were chores 
to do. 

Watching, he wondered once 
again what more he could do. It 
was not the dinosaurs that con- 
cerned him, or the earlier amphib- 
ians, or all the other creatures that 
moved in time about the hills. 

What disturbed him was that 
other being that lay buried deep be- 
neath the Platteville limestone. 

Someone else should know 
about it. The knowledge of it 
should be kept alive so that in the 
days to come — perhaps in another 
hundred years — when man’s tech- 
nology had reached the point where 
it was possible to cope with such a 
problem, something could be done 
to contact — and perhaps to free—, 
the dweller in the stone. 

There would be a record, of 
course, a written record. He would 
see to that. Already that record 
was in progress — a week by week . 
(at times a day to day) account of 
what he had seen, heard and 


learned. .Three large record books 
now were filled with his careful 
writing and another one was well 
started. All written down as hon- 
estly and as carefully and as ob- 
jectively as he could bring himself 
to do it. 

But who would believe what he 
had written? More to the point, 
who would bother to look at it? 
More than likely the books would 
gather dust on some hidden shelf 
until the end of time with no hu- 
man hand ever laid upon them. 
And even if someone, in some fu- 
ture time, should take them down 
and read them, first blowing away 
the accumulated dust, would he or 
she be likely to believe? 

The answer lay clear. He must 
convince someone. Words written 
by a man long dead — and by a 
man of no reputation— could be 
easily dismissed as the product of 
a neurotic mind. But if some scien- 
tist of solid reputation could be 
made to listen, could be made to 
endorse the record, the events that 
paraded across these hills and lay 
within them could stand on solid 
ground, worthy of full investiga- 
tion at some future date. 

A biologist? Or a neuropsychia- 
trist. Or a paleontologist? 

Perhaps it didn’t matter what 
branch of science the man was in. 
Just so he’d listen without laugh- 
ter. It was most important that he 
listen without laughter.

the hills dotted with grazing dino-

saurs, the listener to the stars re- 
membered the time he had gone to 
see the palaeontologist. 

B EN,” the sheriff said, “you're 
way out in left field. That 
Daniels fellow wouldn’t steal no 
chickens. He’s got chickens of his 
own.” 

“The question is,” said Adams, 
“how did he get them chickens?” 
“That makes no sense,” the sher- 
iff said. “He’s a gentleman. You 
can tell that just by talking with 
him. An educated gentleman.” 

“If he’s a gentleman,” asked 
Adams, “what’s he doing out 
here? This ain’t no place for gentle- 
men. He showed up two or three 
years ago and moved out to this 
place. Since that day he hasn’t 
done a tap of work. All he does is 
wander up and down the hills.” 
“He’s a geologist,” said the sher- 
iff. “Or anyway interested in ge- 
ology. A sort of hobby with him. 
He tells me he looks for fossils.” 
Adams assumed the alert look 
of a dog that has sighted a rabbit. 
“So that is it,” he said. “I bet you 
it ain’t fossils he is looking for.” 
“No,” the sheriff said. 

“He’s looking for minerals,” 
said Adams. “He’s prospecting, 
that’s what he’s doing. These hills 
crawl with minerals. All you have 
to do is know where to look.” 

i 

“You’ve spent a lot of time 
looking,” observed the sheriff. 

“I ain’t no geologist. A geolo- 
gist would have a big advantage. 


He would know rocks and such.” 
“He didn’t talk as if he were do- 
ing any prospecting. Just interested 
in the geology, is all. He found 
some fossil clams.” 

“He might be looking for trea- 
sure caves,” said Adams. “He 
might have a map or something.” 
“You know damn well,” the 
sheriff said, “there are no treasure 
caves.” 

“There must be,” Adams in- 
sisted. “The French and Spanish 
were here in the early days. They 
were great ones for treasure, the 
French and Spanish. Always run- 
ning after mines. Always hiding 
things in caves. There was that 
cave over across the river where 
they found a skeleton in Spanish 
armor and the skeleton of a bear 
beside him, with a rusty sword 
stuck into where the bear’s giz- 
zard was.” 

“That was just a story,” said the 
sheriff, disgusted. “Some damn 
fool started it and there was noth- 
ing to it. Some people from the 
university came out and tried to 
run it down. It developed that 
there wasn’t a word of truth in it.’* 
“But Daniels has been messing 
around with caves,” said Adams. 
“I’ve seen him. He spends a lot of 
time in that cave down on Cat Den 
Point. Got to climb a tree to get to 
it.” 

“ Y ou been watching him?” 

“Sure I been watching him. He’s 
up to something and I want to 
know what it is.”

IF 



“Just be sure he doesn't catch 
you doing it,” the sheriff said. 

A DAMS chose to let the matter 
pass. “Well, anyhow,” he 
said, “if there aren't any treasure 
caves, there’s a lot of lead and zinc. 
The man who finds it is about to 
make a million.” 

“Not unless he can find the capi- 
tal to back him,” the sheriff point- 
ed out. 

Adams dug at the ground with 
his heel. “You think he's all right, 
do you?” 

“He tells me he's been losing 
some chickens to a fox. More than 
likely that's what has been happen- 
ing to yours.” 

“If a fox is taking his chickens,” 
Adams asked, “why don’t he shoot 
it?” 

“He isn’t sore about it. He 
seems to think the fox has got a 
right to. He hasn’t even got a gun.” 
“Well, if he hasn't got a gun and 
doesn’t care to hunt himself — then 
why won't he let other people hunt? 
He won't let me and my boys on 
his place with a gun. He has his 
place all posted. That seems to me 
to be unneighborly. That's one of 
the things that makes it so hard to 
get along with him. We’ve always 
hunted on that place. Old Amos 
wasn’t an easy man to get along 
with but he never cared if we did 
some hunting. We've always 
hunted all around here. No one 
ever minded. Seems to me hunting 
should be free. Seems right for a 


man to hunt wherever he's a mind 
to ” 

Sitting on the bench on the hard- 
packed earth in front of the ram- 
shackle house, the sheriff looked 
about him — at the listlessly scratch- 
ing chickens, at the scrawny hound 
sleeping in the shade, its hide 
twitching against the few remain- 
ing flies, at the clothesline strung 
between two trees and loaded with 
drying clothes and dish towels, at 
the washtub balanced on its edge 
on a wash bench leaning against 
the side of the house. 

Christ, he thought, the man 

should be able to find the time to 

/ 

put up a decent clothesline and 
not just string a rope between two 
trees. 

“Ben,” he said, “you're just 
trying to stir up trouble. You re- 
sent Daniels, a man living on a 
farm who doesn't work at farming 
and you're sore because he won’t 
let you hunt his land. He’s got a 
right to live anywhere he wants to 
and he's got a right not to let you 
hunt. I’d lay off him if I were you. 
You don’t have to like him, you 
don’t have to have anything to do 
with him — but don't go around 
spreading fake accusations against 
the man. He could jerk you up in 
court for that.”

see the man seated toward the back 
of the room at a cluttered desk. 
The entire place was cluttered. 
There were long tables covered 
with chunks of rock with embed- 
ded fossils. Scattered here and 
there were stacks of papers. The 
room was large and badly lighted. 
It was a dingy and depressing 
place. 

“Doctor?” Daniels had asked. 
“Are you Dr. Thorne?” 

The man rose and deposited a 
pipe in a cluttered ash tray. He was 
big, burly, with graying hair that 
had a wild look to it. His face was 
seamed and weather-beaten. When 
he moved he shuffled like a bear. 

“You must be Daniels,” he said. 
“Yes, I see you must be. I had you 
on my calendar for three o’clock. 
So glad you could come.” 

His great paw engulfed Daniel’s 
hand. He pointed to a chair beside 
the desk, sat down and retrieved 
his pipe from the overflowing tray, 
began packing it from a large can- 
ister that stood on the desk. 

“Your letter said you wanted to 
see me about something impor- 
tant,” he said. “But then that’s 
what they all say. But there must 
have been something about your 
letter — an urgency, a sincerity. I 
haven’t the time, you understand, 
to see everyone who writes. All of 
them have found something, you 
see. What is it, Mr. Daniels, that 
you have found?” 

Daniels said, “Doctor, I don’t 
quite know how to start what I 


have to say. Perhaps it would be 
best to tell you first that something 
had happened to my brain.” 

Thorne was lighting his pipe. He 
talked around the stem. “In such a 
case, perhaps I am not the man you 
should be talking to. There are 
other people — ” 

“No, that’s not what I mean,” 
said Daniels. “I’m not seeking 
help. I am quite all right physically 
and mentally, too. About five years 
ago I was in a highway accident. 
My wife and daughter were killed 
and I was badly hurt and — ” 

“I am sorry, Mr. Daniels.” 
“Thank you — but that is all in 
.the past. It was rough for a time 
but I muddled through it. That’s 
not what I’m here for. I told you I 
was badly hurt — ” 

“Brain damage?” 

“Only minor. Or so far as the 
medical findings are concerned. 
Very minor damage that seemed to 
clear up rather soon. The bad part 
was the crushed chest and punc- 
tured lung.” 

“But you’re all right now?’’ 

“As good as new,’’ said Daniels. 
“But since the accident my brain’s 
been different. As if I had new 
senses. I see things, understand 
things that seem impossible.” 

“You mean you have hallucina- 
tions?” 

“Not hallucinations. I am sure 
of that. I can see the past.” 

“How do you mean — see the 
past?” 

“Let me try to tell you,” Daniels

IF 



said, “exactly how it started. Sev- 
eral years ago I bought an aban- 
doned farm in southwestern Wis- 
consin. A place to hole up in, a 
place to hide away. With my wife 
and daughter gone I still was re- 
coiling from the world. I had got- 
ten through the first brutal shock 
but I needed a place where I could 
lick my wounds. If this sounds like 
self-pity— I don’t mean it that way. 
I am trying to be objective about 
why I acted as I did, why I bought 
the farm.” 

“Yes, I understand,” said 
Thorne. “But I’m not entirely sure 
hiding was the wisest thing to do.” 

“Perhaps not, but it seemed to 
me the answer. It has worked out 
rather well. I fell in love with the 
country. That part of Wisconsin is 
ancient land. It had stood uncov- 
ered by the sea for four hundred 
million years. For some reason it 
was not overridden by the Pleisto- 
cene glaciers. It has changed, of 
course, but only as the result of 
weathering. There have been no 
great geologic upheavals, no mas- 
sive erosions — nothing to disturb 
it.” 

“Mr. Daniels,” said Thorne, 
somewhat testily, “I don’t quite 
see what all this has to do — ” 

“I’m sorry. I am just trying to 
lay the background for what I 
came to tell you. It came on rather 
slowly at first and I thought that I 
was crazy, that I was seeing things, 
that there had been more brain 
damage than had been apparent — 


or that I was finally cracking up. I 
did a lot of walking in the hills, you 
see. The country is wild and 
rugged and beautiful — a good 
place to be out in. The walking 
made me tired and I could sleep at 
night. But at times the hills 
changed. Only a little at first. Lat- 
er on they changed more and final- 
ly they became places I had never 
seen before, that no one had ever 
seen before.” 

Thorne scowled. “You are try- 
ing to tell me they changed into the 
past.” 

D ANIELS nodded. “Strange 
vegetation, funny-looking 
trees. In the earlier times, of 
course, no grass at all. Underbrush 
of ferns and scouring rushes. 
Strange animals, strange things in 
the sky. Sabretooth cats and mas- 
todons, pterosaurs and uintatheres 
and — ” 

“All at the same time?” Thorne 
asked, interrupting. “All mixed 
up?” 

“Not at all. The time periods I 
see seem to be true time periods. 
Nothing out of place. I didn’t 
know at first — but when I was 
able to convince myself that I was 
not hallucinating I sent away for 
books. I studied. I’ll never be an 
expert, of course — never a geolo- 
gist or paleontologist— but I 
learned enough to distinguish one 
period from another, to have some 
idea of what I was looking at.” 
Thorne took his pipe out of his

mouth and perched it in the ash 
tray. He ran a massive hand 
through his wild hair. 

It’s unbelievable/’ he said. “It 
simply couldn’t happen. You said 
all this business came on rather 
slowly?’’ 

“To begin with it was hazy, the 
past foggily imposed upon the 
present, then the present would 
slowly fade and the past came in, 
real and solid. But it’s different 
now. Once in a while there’s a bit 
of flickering as the present gives 
way to past — but mostly it simply 
changes, as if at the snap of a fin- 
ger. The present goes away and 
I’m standing in the past. The past 
is all around me. Nothing of the 
present is left.’’ 

“But you aren’t really in the 
past? Physically, I mean.’’ 

“There are times when I’m not 
in it at all. I stand in the present 
and the distant hills or the river 
valley changes. But ordinarily it 
changes all around me, although 
the funny thing about it is that, as 
you say, I’m not really in it. I can 
see it and it seems real enough for 
me to walk around in it. I can walk 
over to a tree and put my hand out 
to feel it and the tree is there. But 
I seem to make no impact on the 
past. It’s as if I were not there at 
all. The animals do not see me. 
I’ve walked up to within a few feet 
of dinosaurs. They can’t see me or 
hear or smell me. If they had I’d 
have been dead a dozen times. It’s 
as if I were walking through a 


three-dimensional movie. At first 
I worried a lot about the surface 
differences that might exist. I’d 
wake up dreaming of going into 
the past and being buried up to my 
waist in a rise of ground that since 
has eroded away. But it doesn’t 
work that way. I’m walking along 
in the present and then I’m walk- 
ing in the past. It’s as if a door 
were there and I stepped through 
it. I told you I don’t really seem to 
be in the past — but I’m not in the 
present, either. I tried to get some 
proof. I took a camera with me 
and shot a lot of pictures. When 
the films were developed there was 
nothing on them. Not the past — 
but what is more important, not 
the present, either. If I had been 
hallucinating, the camera should 
have caught pictures of the pres- 
ent. But apparently there was 
nothing there for the camera to 
take. I thought maybe the camera 
failed or I had the wrong kind of 
film. So I tried several cameras 
and different types of film and 
nothing happened. I got no pic- 
tures. I tried bringing something 
back. I picked flowers, after there 
were flowers. I had no trouble pick- 
ing them but when I came back to 
the present I was empty-handed. I 
tried to bring back other things as 
well. I thought maybe it was only 
live things, like flowers, that I 
couldn’t bring, so I tried inorganic 
things — like rocks — but I never 
was able to bring anything back.’’ 
“How about a sketch pad?’’ 


40 


IF 



“I thought of that but I never 
used one. I’m no good at sketch- 
ing — besides, l figured, what was 
the use. The pad would come back 
blank.” 

“But you never tried.” 

“No,” said Daniels. “I never 
tried. Occassionally I do make 
sketches after I get back to the 
present. Not every time but some- 
times. From memory. But, as I 
said, I’m not very good at sketch- 
ing. 

“I don’t know,” said Thorne. “I 
don’t really know. This all sounds 
incredible. But if there should be 
something to it — Tell me, were 
you ever frightened? You seem 
quite calm and matter-of-fact 
about it now. But at first you must 
have been frightened.” 

“At first,” said Daniels, “I was 
petrified. Not only was I scared, 
physically scared — frightened for 
my safety, frightened that I’d fall- 
en into a place from which I never 
could escape — but also afraid that 
I’d gone insane. And there was the 
loneliness.” 

“What do you mean — loneli- 
ness? 

“Maybe that’s not the right 
word. Out of place. I was where I 
had no right to be. Lost in a place 
where man had not as yet appeared 
and would not appear for millions 
of years. In a word so utterly alien 
that I wanted to hunker down and 
shiver. But I, not the place, was 
really the alien there. I still get 
some of that feeling every now and 


then. I know about it, of course, 
and am braced against it but at 
times it still gets to me. I’m a 
stranger to the air and the light of 
that other time — it’s all imagina- 
tion, of course.” 

“Not necessarily,” said Thorne. 

“But the greatest fear is' gone 
now, entirely gone. The fear I was 
insane. I am convinced now.” 

“How are you convinced? How 
could a man be convinced?” 

“The animals. The creatures I 
see — ” 

“You mean you recognize them 
from the illustrations in those 
books you have been reading.” 

“No, not that. Not entirely that. 
Of course the pictures helped. But 
actually it’s the other way around. 
Not the likenesses, but the differ- 
ences. You see, none of the crea- 
tures are exactly like the pictures 
in the books. Some of them not at 
all like them. Not like the recon- 
structions the paleontologists put 
together. If they had been I might 
still have thought they were hallu- 
cinations, that what I was seeing 
was influenced by what I’d seen 
or read. I could have been feeding 
my imagination on prior knowl- 
edge. But since that was not the 
case, it seemed logical to assume 
that what I see is real. How could 
I imagine that Tyrannosaurus had 
dewlaps all the colors of the rain- 
bow. How could l imagine that 
some of the sabertooths had tas- 
sels on their ears? How could any- 
one possibly imagine that the big

thunder beasts of the Eocene had 
hides as colorful as giraffes?” 

“Mr. Daniels,” said Thorne, “I 
have great reservations about all 
that you have told me. Every fiber 
of my training rebels against it. I 
have a feeling that I should waste 
no time on it. Undoubtedly, you 
believe what you have told me. 
You have the look of an honest 
man about you. Have you talked 
to any other men about this? Any 
other paleontologists or geolo- 
gists? Perhaps a neuropsychia- 
trist?” 

“No,” said Daniels. “You’re 
the only person, the only man I 
have talked with. And 1 haven’t 
told you all of it. This is really all 
just background.” 

“My God, man — just back- 
ground?” 

“Yes, just background. You 
see, I also listen to the stars.” 

Thorne got up from his chair, 
began shuffling together a stack of 
papers. He retrieved the dead pipe 
from the ash tray and stuck it in 
his mouth. 

His voice, when he spoke, was 
noncommittal. 

“Thank you for coming in,” he 
said. “It's been most interesting.” 

Ill 

A ND that was where he had 
made his mistake, Daniels 
told himself. He never should have 
mentioned listening to the stars. 
His interview had gone well until 

9 


he had. Thorne had not believed 
him, of course, but he had been 
intrigued, would have listened 
further, might even have pursued 
the matter, although undoubtedly 
secretly and very cautiously. 

At fault, Daniels knew, had 
been his obsession with the crea- 
ture in the stone. The past was 
nothing — it was the creature in the 
stone that was important and to 
tell of it, to explain it and how he 
knew that it was there, he must tell 
about his listening to the stars. 

He should have known better, 
he told himself. He should have 
held his tongue. But here had been 
a man who, while doubting, still 
had been willing to listen without 
laughter and, in his thankfulness 
Daniels had spoken too much. 

The wick of the oil lamp set up- 
on the kitchen table guttered in the 
air currents *that came in around 
the edges of the ill-fitting win- 
dows. A wind had risen after 
chores were done and now shook 
the house with galelike blasts. On 
the far side of the room the fire in 
the wood-burning stove threw 
friendly, wavering flares of light 
across the floor and the stovepipe, 
in response to the wind that swept 
the chimney top, made gurgling, 
sucking sounds. 

Thorne had mentioned a neuro- 
psychiatrist, Daniels remembered, 
and perhaps that was the kind of 
man he should have gone to see. 
Perhaps, before he attempted to 
interest anyone in what he could 


42 


IF 



see or hear, he should make an ef- 
fort to find out why and how he 
could hear and see these things. A 
man who studied the workings of 
the brain and mind might come up 
with new answers — if answers 
were to be had. 

Had that blow upon his head so 
rearranged, so shifted some pro- 
cess in his brain that he had gained 
new capabilities? Was it possible 
that his brain had been so jarred, 
so disarranged as to bring into 
play certain latent talents that pos- 
sibly, in millennia to come, might 
have developed naturally by evolu- 
tionary means? Had the brain 
damage short-circuited evolution 
and given him — and him alone — 
these capabilities, these senses, 
perhaps a million years ahead of 
time? 

It seemed — well, not reasonable 
but one possible explanation. Still, 
A trained man night have some 
other explanation. 

He pushed his chair back from 
the table and walked over to the 
stove. He used the lifter to raise 
the lid of the rickety old cook 
stove. The wood in the firebox 
had burned down to embers. 
Stooping, he picked up a stick of 
wood from the woodbox and fitted 
it in, added another smaller one 
and replaced the lid. One of these 
days soon, he told himself, he 
would have to get the furnace in 
shape for operation. 

He went out to stand on the 
porch, looking toward the river 


hills. The wind whooped out of 
the north, whistling around the 
corners of the building and boom- 
ing in the deep hollows that ran 
down to the river but the sky was 
clear — steely clear, wiped fresh by 
the wind and sprinkled with stars, 
their light shivering in the raging 
atmosphere. 

Looking up at the stars, he won- 
dered what they might be saying 
but he didn’t try to listen. It took a 
lot of effort and concentration to 
listen to the stars. He had first lis- 
tened to them on a night like this, 
standing out here on the porch and 
wondering what they might be say- 
ing, wondering if the stars did 
talk among fhemselves. A foolish, 
vagrant thought, a wild, day- 
dreaming sort of notion but, voic- 
ing it, he had tried to listen, know- 
ing even as he did that it was fool- 
ishness but glorying in his foolish- 
ness, telling himself how fortunate 
he was that he could afford to be 
so inane as to try to listen to the 
stars— as a child might believe in 
Santa Claus or the Easter rabbit. 
He’d listened and he’d heard and 
while he’d been astonished, there 
could be no doubt about it, no 
doubt at all that out there some- 
where other beings were talking 
back and forth. He might have 
been listening in on a party line, 
he thought, but a party line that 
carried millions, perhaps billions, 
of long-distance conversations. 
Not words, of course, but some- 
thing (thought, perhaps) that was 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


43 



as plain as words. Not all of it un- 
derstandable — much of it, as a 
matter of fact, not understand- 
able — possibly because his back- 
ground and his learning gave him 
no basis for an understanding. He 
compared himself to an Austral- 
ian aborigine listening to the con- 
versation of a couple of nuclear 
physicists discussing a new theory. 

Shortly after that, when he had 
been exploring the shallow cave 
down on Cat Den Point, he had 
picked up his first indication of 
the creature buried in the stone. 
Perhaps, he thought, if he’d not 
listened to the stars, if he’d not 
known he could listen to the stars, 
if he’d not trained his mind by lis- 
tening, he would not have heard 
the creature buried deep beneath 
the limestone. 

He stood looking at the stars 
and listening to the wind and, far 
across the river, on a road that 
wound over the distant hills, he 
caught the faint glimmer of head- 
lights as a car made it way 
through the night. The wind let up 
for a moment, as if gathering its 
strength to blow yet even harder 
and, in the tiny lull that existed be- 
fore the wind took up again, he 
heard another sound — the sound 
of an axe hitting wood. He lis- 
tened carefully and the sound 
came again but so tossed about by 
the wind that he could not be sure 
of its direction. 

He must be mistaken, he 
thought. No one would be out 


and chopping on a night like this. 
Coon hunters might be the an- 
swer. Coon hunters at times 
chopped down a tree to dislodge a 
prey too well hidden to be spotted. 
The unsportsmanlike trick was 
one that Ben Adams and his over- 
grown, gangling sons might en- 
gage in. But this was no night for 
coon hunting. The wind would 
blow away scent and the dogs 
would be unable to track. Quiet 
nights were the best for hunting 
coon. And no one would be in- 
sane enough to cut down a tree on 
a night like this when a swirling 
wind might catch it and topple it 
back upon the cutters. 

He listened to catch the sound 
again but the wind, recovering 
from its lull, was blowing harder 
than ever now and there was no 
chance of hearing any sound 
smaller than the wind. 

T HE next day came in mild 
and gray, the wind no more 
than a whisper. Once in the night 
Daniels had awoken to hear it 
rattling the windows, pounding at 
the house and howling mournfully 
in the tangled hollows that lay 
above the river. But when he wok-e 
again all was quiet and faint light 
was graying the windows. Dressed 
and out of doors he found a land 
of peace — the sky so overcast that 
there was no hint of sun, the air 
fresh, as if newly washed but heavy 
with the moist grayness that over- 
lay the land. The autumn foliage

that clothes the hills had taken on 
a richer luster than it had worn in 
the flooding autumn sunlight. 

After chores and breakfast 
Daniels set out for the hills. As he 
went down the slope toward the 
head of the first hollow he found 
himself hoping that the geologic 
shift would not come about today. 
There were many times it didn’t 
and there seemed to be no reason 
to its taking place or its failure to 
take place. He had tried at times 
to find some reason for it, had 
made careful notes of how he felt 
or what he did, even the course he 
took when he went for his daily 
walk, but he had found no pattern. 
It lay, of course, somewhere in his 
brain — something triggered into 
operation his new capability. But 
the phenomenon was random and 
involuntary. He had no control of 
it, no conscious control, at least. 
At times he had tried to use it, to 
bring the geologic shift about — in 
each case had failed. Either he did 
not know how to go about it or it 
was truly random. 

Today, he hoped, his capability 
would not exercise its option, for 
he wanted to walk in the hills 
when they had assumed one of 
their most attractive moods, filled 
with gentle melancholy, all their 
harshness softened by the grayness 
of the atmosphere, the trees stand- 
ing silently like old and patient 
friends waiting for one’s coming, 
the fallenleaves and forest mold 
so hushed footfalls made no sound. 


He went down to the head of the 
hollow and sat on a fallen log be- 
side a gushing spring that sent a 
stream of water tinkling down the 
boulder-strewn creek bed. Here, in 
May, in the pool below the spring, 
the marsh marigolds had bloomed 
and the sloping hillsides had been 
covered with the pastel of hepat- 
icas. But now he saw no sign of 
either. The woods had battened 
down for winter. The summer and 
the autumn plants were either dead 
or dying, the drifting leaves inter- 
locking on the forest floor to form 
cover against the ice and snow. 

In this place, thought Daniels, a 
man walked with a season’s ghosts. 
This was the way it had been for a 
million years or more, although 
not always. During many millions 
of years, in a time long gone, these 
hills and all the world had basked 
in an eternal summertime. And 
perhaps not a great deal more than 
ten thousand years before a mile- 
high wall of ice had reared up not 
too far to the north, perhaps close 
enough for a man who stood 
where his house now sat might 
have seen the faint line of blueness 
that would have been the top of 
that glacial barrier. But even then, 
although the mean temperature 
would have been lower, there had 
still been seasons. 

Leaving the log, Daniels went 
on down the hollow, following the 
narrow path that looped along the 
hillside, a cowpath beaten down at 
a time when there had been more 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


45 



cows at pasture in these woods 
than the two that Daniels owned. 
Following it, Daniels noted, as he 
had many times before, the excel- 
lent engineering sense of a cow. 
Cows always chose the easiest 
grade in stamping out their paths. 

He stopped barely beyond the 
huge white oak that stood at a 
bend in the path, to have a look at 
the outsize jack-in-the-pulpit plant 
he had observed throughout the 
year. Its green-purple hood had 
withered away completely, leaving 
only the scarlet fruit cluster which 
in the bitter months ahead would 
serve as food for birds. 

As the path continued, it 
plunged deeper between the hills 
and here the silence deepened and 
the grayness thickened until one’s 
world became private. 

There, across the stream bed, 
was the den. Its yellow maw gaped 
beneath a crippled, twisted cedar. 
There, in the spring, he had 
watched baby foxes play. From far 
down the hollow came the distant 
quacking of ducks upon the pond 
in the river valley. And up on the 
steep hillside loomed Cat Den 
Point, the den carved by slow- 
working wind and weather out of 
the sheer rock of the cliff. 

But something was wrong. 

S TANDING on the path and 
looking up the hill, he could 
sense the wrongness, although he 
could not at first tell exactly what 
it was. More of the cliff face was 


visible and something was missing. 
Suddenly he knew that the tree 
was no longer there — the tree that 
for years had been climbed by 
homing wildcats heading for the 
den after a night of prowling and 
later by humans like himself who 
wished to seek out the wildcat’s 
den. The cats, of course, were no 
longer there — had not been there 
for many years. In the pioneer 
days they had been hunted almost 
to extermination because at times 
they had exhibited the poor judg- 
ment of bringing down a lamb. 
But the evidence of their occu- 
pancy of the cave could still be 
found by anyone who looked. Far 
back in the narrow recesses of the 
shallow cave tiny bones and the 
fragmented skulls of small mam- 
mals gave notice of food brought 
home by the wildcats for their 
young. 

The tree had been old and 
gnarled and had stood, perhaps, 
for several centuries and there 
would have been no sense of any- 
one’s cutting it down, for it had no 
value as lumber, twisted as it was. 

-‘And in any case to get it out of 
the woods would have been impos- 
sible. Yet, last night, when he had 
stepped out on the porch, he had 
seemed to hear in a lull in the wind 
the sound of chopping — and today 
the tree was gone. 

Unbelieving, he scrambled up 
the slope as swiftly as he could. In 
places the slope of the wild hillside 
slanted at an angle so close to 


46 . 


IF 



forty-five degrees that he went on 
hands and knees, clawing himself 
upward, driven by an illogical fear 
that had to do with more than sim- 
ply a missing tree. 

For it was in the cat den that 
one could hear the creature buried 
in the stone. 

He could recall the day he first 
had heard the creature and on that 
day he had not believed his senses. 
For he had been sure the sound 
came from his own imagination, 
was born of his walking with the 
dinosaurs and eavesdropping on 
the stars. It had not come the first 
time he had climbed the tree to 
reach the cave-that-was-a-den. He 
had been there several times be- 
fore, finding a perverse satisfac- 
tion at discovering so unlikely a 
retreat. He would sit on the ledge 
that ran before the cave and stare 
over the froth of treetop foliage 
that clothed the plunging hillside, 
but afforded a glimpse of the pond 
that lay in the flood plain of the 
river. He could not see the river it- 
self — one must stand on higher 
ground to see the river. 

He liked the cave and the ledge 
because it gave him seclusion, a 
place cut off from the world, where 
he still might see this restricted 
corner of the world but no one 
could see him. This same sense of 
being shut out from the world had 
appealed to the wildcats, he had 
told himself. And here,* for them, 
not only was seclusion but safety 
—and especially safety for their 


young. There was no way the den 
could be approached other than by 
climbing the tree. 

He had first heard the creature 
when he had crawled into the deep- 
est part of the shallow cave to mar- 
vel at the little heaps of bones and 
small shattered skulls where the 
wildcat kittens, perhaps a century 
before, had crouched and snarled 
at feast. Crouching where the baby 
wildcats once had crouched, he 
had felt the presence welling up at 
him, coming up to him from the 
depth of stone that lay far beneath 
him. Only the presence at first, 
only the knowing that something 
was down there. He had been skep- 
tical at first, later on believing. In 
time belief had become solid cer- 
tainty. 

He could record no words, of 
course, for he had never heard any 
actual sound. But the intelligence 
and the knowing came creeping 
through his body, through his fin- 
gers spread flat upon the stone 
floor of the cave, through his knees, 
which also pressed the stone. He 
absorbed it without hearing and 
the more he absorbed the more he 
was convinced that deep in the 
limestone, buried in one of the 
strata, an intelligence was trapped. 
And finally the time came when he 
could catch fragments of thoughts 
— the edges of the living in the sen- 
tience encysted in the rock. 

What he heard he did not under- 
stand. This very lack of under- 
standing was significant. If he had 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


47 





understood he would have put his 
discovery down to his imagination. 

As matters stood he had no knowl- 
edge that could possibly have 
served as a spring-board to imag- 
ine the thing of which he was made 
aware. He caught an awareness of 
tangled life relationships which 
made no sense at all — none of 
which could be understood, but 
which lay in tiny, tangled frag- 
ments of outrageous (yet simple) 
information no human mind could 
quite accept. And he was made to 
know the empty hollowness of dis- 
tances so vast that the mind reeled 
at the very hint of them and of the 
naked emptiness in which those 
distances must lie. Even in his 
eavesdropping on the stars he had 
never experienced such devastating 
concepts of the other-where-and- 
when. There was other informa- 
tion, scraps and bits he sensed 
faintly that might fit into man- 
kind’s knowledge. But he never 
found enough to discover the prop- 
er slots for their insertion into the 
mass of mankind’s knowledge. The 
greater part of what he sensed, 
however, was simply beyond his 
grasp and perhaps beyond the 
grasp of any human. But even so 
his mind would catch and hold it 
in all its incomprehensibility and 
it would lie there festering amid 
his human thoughts. 

T HEY were or it was, he knew, 
not trying to talk with him — 
undoubtedly they (or it) did not 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


49 



know that such a thing as a man 
existed, let alone himself. But 
whether the creature (or creatures 
— he found the collective singular 
easier) simply was thinking or 
might, in its loneliness, be talking 
to itself — or whether it might be 
trying to communicate with some- 
thing other than himself, he could 
not determine. 

Thinking about it, sitting on the 
ledge before the cave, he had tried 
to make some logic of his find, had 
tried to find a way in which the 
creature’s presence might be best 
explained. And while he could not 
be sure of it — in fact, had no data 
whatsoever to bolster his belief — 
he came to think that in some far 
geologic day when a shallow sea 
had lain upon this land, a ship 
from space had fallen into the sea 
to be buried deeply in the mud 
that in later millennia had hard- 
ened into limestone. In this man- 
ner the ship had become entrapped 
and so remained to this very day. 
He realized his reasoning held 
flaws — for one thing, the pressure 
involved in the fashioning of the 
stone must have been so great as 
to have crushed and flattened any 
ship unless it should be made of 
some material far beyond the 
range of man’s technology. 

Accident, he wondered, or a 
way of hiding? Trapped or 
planned? He had no way of know- 
ing and further speculation was 
ridiculous, based as it necessarily 
must be upon earlier assumptions 


that were entirely without support. 

Scrambling up the hillside, he 
finally reached the point where he 
could see that, in all truth, the tree 
had been cut down. It had fallen 
downhill and slid for thirty feet or 
so before it came to rest, its 
branches entangled with the trunks 
of other trees which had slowed its 
plunge. The stump stood raw, the 
whiteness of its wood shining in 
the grayness of the day. A deep cut 
had been made in the downhill side 
of it and the final felling had been 
accomplished by a saw. Little piles 
of brownish sawdust lay beside the 
stump. A two-man saw, he 
thought. 

From where Daniels stood the 
hill slanted down at an abrupt an- 
gle but just ahead of him, just be- 
yond the stump, was a curious 
mound that broke the hillside 
slope. In some earlier day, more 
than likely, great masses of stone 
had broken from th£ cliff face and 
piled up at its base, to be masked 
in time by the soil that came about 
from the forest litter. Atop the 
mound grew a clump of birch, 
their powdery white trunks look- 
ing like huddled ghosts against the 
darkness of the other trees. 

The cutting of the tree, he told 
himself once again, had been a 
senseless pieces of business. The 
tree was worthless and had served 
no particular purpose except as a 
road to reach the den. Had some- 
one, he wondered, known that he 
used it to reach the den and cut it 


50 


IF 



out of malice? Or had someone, 
perhaps, hidden something in the 
cave and then cut down the tree so 
there would be no way in which to 
reach it? 

But who would hold him so 
much malice as to come out on a 
night raging with wind, working 
by lantern light, risking his life, to 
cut down the tree? Ben Adams? 
Ben was sore because Daniels 
would not permit hunting on his 
land but surely that was no suffi- 
cient reason for this rather labor- 
ious piece of petty spite. 

The other alternative — that 
something hidden in the cave had 
caused the tree’s destruction — 
seemed more likely, although the 
very cutting of the tree would serve 
to advertise the strangeness of the 
place. 

Daniels stood puzzled, shaking 
his head. Then he thought of a way 
to find out some answers. The day 
still was young and he had nothing 
else to do. 

He started climbing up the hill, 
heading for his barn to pick up 
some rope. 

IV 

T HERE was nothing in the 
cave. It was exactly as it had 
been before. A few autumn leaves 
had blown into the far -corners. 
Chips of weathered stone had fall- 
en from the rocky overhang, tiny 
evidences of the endless process of 
erosion which had formed the cave 


and in a few thousand years from 
now might wipe it out. 

Standing on the narrow ledge in 
front of the cave, Daniels stared 
out across the valley and was sur- 
prised at the change of view that had 
resulted from the cutting of the 
tree. The angles of vision seemed 
somehow different and the hillside 
itself seemed changed. Startled, he 
examined the sweep of the slope 
closely and finally satisfied him- 
self that all that had changed was 
his way of seeing it. He was seeing 
trees and contours that earlier had 
been masked. 

His rope hung from the outcurv- 
ing rock face that formed the roof 
of the cave. It was swaying gently 
in the wind and, watching it, Dan- 
iels recalled that earlier in the day 
he had felt no wind. But now one 
had sprang up from the west. Be- 
low him the treetops were bending 
to it. 

He turned toward the west and 
felt the wind on his face and a 
breath of chill. The feel of the wind 
faintly disturbed him, rousing 
some atavistic warning that came 
down from the days when naked, 
roaming bands of protomen had 
turned, as he turned now, to sniff 
the coming weather. The wind 
might mean that a change of 
weather could be coming and per- 
haps he should clamber up the rope 
and head back for the farm. 

But he felt a strange reluctance 
to leave. It had been often so, he 
recalled. For here was a wild sort 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


51 



of refuge which barred out the 
world and the little world that it 
let in was a different kind — a more 
primal and more basic and less 
complicated world than the one 
he’d fled from. 

A flight of mallards came wing- 
ing up from the pond in the river 
valley, arrowing above the tree- 
tops, banking and slanting up the 
long curve of the bluff and then, 
having cleared the bluff top, 
wheeling gracefully back toward 
the river. He watched them until 
they dipped down behind the trees 
that fringed the unseen river. 

Now it was time to go. There 
was no use of waiting longer. It 
had been a fool’s errand in the first 
place; he had been wrong to let 
himself think something might be 
hidden in the cave. 

He turned back to the rope and 
the rope was gone. 

For a moment he stared stupid- 
ly at the point along the cliff face 
where the rope had hung, swaying 
in the breeze. Then he searched for 
some sign of it, although there was 
little area to search. The rope 
could have slid, perhaps, for a 
short distance along the edge of 
the overhanging mass of rock but 
it seemed incredible that it could 
have slid far enough to have van- 
ished from his sight. 

The rope was new, strong, and 
he had tied it securely to the oak 
tree on the bluff above the cliff, 
snugging it tightly around the 
trunk and testing the'knot to make 


certain that it would not slip. 

And now the rope was gone. 
There had to be a human hand in 
this. Someone had come along, 
seen the rope and quietly drawn it 
up and now was crouched on the 
bluff above him, waiting for his 
frightened outburst when he found 
himself stranded. It was the sort of 
crude practical joke that any numr 
ber of people in the community 
might believe to be the height of 
humor. The thing to do, of course, 
was to pay no attention, to remain 
quiet and wait until the joke would 
pall upon the jokester. 

So he hunkered down upon the 
ledge and waited. Ten minutes, he 
told himself, or at least fifteen, 
would wear out the patience of the 
jokester. Then the rope would 
come down and he could climb up 
and go back to the house. Depend- 
ing upon who the joker might turn 
out to be, he’d take him home and 
pour a drink for him and the two 
of them, sitting in the kitchen, 
would have a laugh together. 

He found that he was hunching 
his shoulders against the wind, 
which seemed to have a sharper 
bite than when he first had noticed 
it. It was shifting from the west to 
north and that was no good. 

Squatting on the ledge, he no- 
ticed that beads of moisture had 
gathered upon his jacket sleeve — 
not a result of rain, exactly, but of 
driven mist. If the temperature 
should drop a bit the weather 
might turn nasty. 


52 


IF 



He waited, huddled, listening 
for a sound — a scuffling of feet 
through leaves, the snap of broken 
brush— that would betray the pres- 
ence of someone on the clifftop. 
But there was no sound at all. The 
day was muffled. Even the 
branches of the trees beneath his 
perch, swaying in the wind, 
swayed without their usual creaks 
and groans. 

Fifteen minutes must have 
passed and there had been no 
sound from atop the cliff. The 
wind had increased somewhat and 
when he twisted his head to one 
side to try to look up he could feel 
the soft slash of the driving mist 
against his cheek. 

He could keep silent no longer 
in hope of waiting out the jokester. 
He sensed, in a sudden surge of 
panic, that time was running out 
on him. 

“Hey, up there — ” he shouted. 

He waited and there was no re- 
sponse. 

He shouted again, more loudly 
this time. 

Ordinarily the cliff acrpss the 
hollow should have bounced back 
echoes. But now there were no 
echoes and his shout seemed damp- 
ened, as if this wild place had 
erected some sort of fence to hem 
him in. 

He shouted again and the misty 
world took his voice and swal- 
lowed it. 

A hissing sound started. Daniels 
saw it was caused by tiny pellets of 


ice streaming through the branches 
of the trees. From one breath to 
another the driven mist had turned 
to ice. 

He walked back and forth on 
the ledge in front of the cave, 
twenty feet at most, looking for 
some way of escape. The ledge 
went out into space and then 
sheered off. The slanting projec- 
tion of rock came down from 
above. He was neatly trapped. 

He moved back into the cave 
and hunkered down. Here he was 
protected from the wind and he 
felt, even through his rising panic, 
a certain sense of snugness. The 
cave was not yet cold. But the 
temperature must be dopping and 
dropping rather swiftly or the mist 
would not have turned to ice. He 
wore a light jacket and could not 
make a fire. He did not smoke and 
never carried matches. 

F OR the first time he faced the 
real seriousness of his position. 
It might be days before anyone 
noticed he was missing. He had 
few visitors and no one had ever 
paid too much attention to him. 
Even if someone should find that 
he was missing and a hunt for him 
were launched, what were the 
chances that he would be found? 
Who would think to look in this 
hidden cave? How long, he won- 
dered, could a man survive in cold 
and hunger. 

If he could not get out of here, 
and soon, what about his live- 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


53 



stock? The cows would be heading 
home from pasture, seeking shel- 
ter from the storm and there would 
be no one there to let them into the 
barn. If they were not milked for a 
day or two they would be tor- 
mented by swollen udders. The 
hogs and chickens would go unfed. 
A man, he thought, had no right to 
take the kind of chance he had tak- 
en when so many living creatures 
were dependent on him. 

He crawled farther back into the 
cave and stretched himself out on 
his belly, wedging himself into its 
deepest recess, an ear laid against 
the stone. 

The creature still was there — of 
course it still was there. It was 
trapped even more securely than 
himself, held down by, perhaps, 
several hundred feet of solid rock, 
which had been built up most de- 
liberately through many millions 
of years. 

It was remembering again. In its 
mind was another place and, while 
part of that flow of memory was 
blurred and wavy, the rest was 
starkly clear. A great dark plain 
of rock, one great slab of rock, 
ran to a far horizon and above that 
far horizon a reddish sun came up 
and limned against the great red 
ball of rising sun was a hinted 
structure — an irregularity of the 
horizon that suggested a place. A 
castle, perhaps, or a city or a great 
cliff dwelling — it was hard to make 
out what it was or to be absolutely 
sure that it was anything at all. 


Home? Was that black expanse 
of rock the spaceport of the old 
home planet? Or might it be only a 
place the creature had visited be- 
fore it had come to Earth? \ place 
so fantastic, perhaps, that it lin- 
gered in the mind. 

Other things mixed into the 
memory, sensory symbols that 
might have applied to personalities, 
life forms, smells, tastes. Although 
he could be wrong, Daniels knew, 
in supplying this entrapped crea- 
ture with human sensory percep- 
tions, these human sensory percep- 
tions were the only ones he knew 
about. 

And now, listening in on the 
memory of that flat black expanse 
of rock and imagining the rising 
sun which outlined the structure 
on the far horizon, Daniels did 
something he had never tried to do 
before. He tried to talk back to 
the buried creature, tried to let it 
know that someone was listening 
and had heard, that it was not as 
lonely and as isolated as it might 
have thought it was. 

He did not talk with his tongue 
— that would have been a senseless 
thing to do. Sound could never 
carry through those many feet of 
stone. He talked with his mind 
instead. 

Hello, • down there, he said. 
This is a friend of yours. I’ve been 
listening to you for a long, long 
time and I hope that you can hear 
me. If you can, let us talk together. 
Let me try to make you under -

IF 



stand about myself and the world 
/ live in and you tell me about 
yourself and the kind of world you 
lived in and how you came to be 
where you are and if there is any- 
thing l can do for you, any help 
that I can give. 

He said that much and no more. 
Having spoken, he continued lying 
with his ear against the bard cave 
floor, listening to find out if the 
creature might have heard him. 
But the creature apparently had 
not heard or, having heard, ig- 
nored him as something not worth 
its attention. It went on thinking 
about the place where the dull red 
sun was rising above the horizon. 

It had been foolish, and perhaps 
presumptuous, he knew, for him 
to have tried to speak to it. He had 
never tried before; he had simply 
listened. And he had never tried,, 
either, to speak to those others 
who talked among the stars — 
again he’d simply listened. 

What new dimension had been 
added to himself, he wondered, 
that would have permitted him to 
try to communicate with the crea- 
ture? Had the possibility that he 
was about to die moved him? 

The creature in the stone might 
not be subject to death — it might 
be immortal. 

He crawled out of the far recess 
of the cave and crept out to where 
he had room to hunker down. 

T HE storm had worsened. The 
ice now was mixed with snow 


and the temperature had fallen. 
The ledge in front of the cave was 
filmed with slippery ice. If a man 
tried to walk it he’d go plunging 
down the cliff face to his death. 

The wind was blowing harder. 
The branches of the trees were 
waving and a storm of leaves was 
banking down the hillside, flying 
with the ice and snow. 

From where he squatted he 
could see the topmost branches of 
the clump of birches which grew 
atop the mound just beyond where 
the cave tree had stood. And these 
branches, it seemed to him, were 
waving about far more violently 
than could be accounted for by 
wind. They were lashing wildly 
from one side to the other and 
even as he watched they seemed to 
rise higher in the air, as if the trees, 
in some great agony, were raising 
their branches far above their heads 
in a plea for mercy. 

Daniels crept forward on his 
hands and knees and thrust his 
head out to see down to the base of 
the cliff. 

Not only the topmost branches 
of the clump of birches were sway- 
ing but the entire clump seemed to 
be motion, thrashing about as if 
some unseen hand were attempt- 
ing to wrench it from the soil. But 
even as he thought this, he saw 
that the ground itself was in agita- 
tion, heaving up and out. It looked 
exactly as if someone had taken a 
time-lapse movie of the develop- 
ment of a frost boil with the film 


THE THING IN THE STONE

now being run at a normal speed. 
The ground was heaving up and 
the clump was heaving with it. A 
shower of gravel and other debris 
was flowing down the slope, loos- 
ened by the heaving of the ground. 
A boulder broke away and crashed 
down the hill, crushing brush and 
shrubs and leaving hideous scars. 

Daniels watched in horrified fas- 
cination. 

Was he witnessing, he won- 
dered, some wonderfully speeded- 
up geological process? He tried to 
pinpoint exactly what kind of pro- 
cess it might be. He knew of one 
that seemed to fit. The mound 
kept on heaving upward, splinter- 
ing outward from its center. A 
great flood of loose debris was 
now pouring down the slope, 
leaving a path of brown in the whit- 
ness of the fallen snow. The clump 
of birch tipped over and went skid- 
ding down the slope and out of the 
place where it had stood a shape 
emerged. 

Not a solid shape, but a hazy 
one that looked as if someone 
had scraped some stardust from 
the sky and molded it into a 
ragged, shifting form that did not 
set into any definite pattern, that 
kept shifting and changing, al- 
though it did not entirely lose all 
resemblance to the shape in which 
it might originally have been 
molded. It looked as a loose con- 
glomeration of atoms might look 
if atoms could be seen. It sparkled 
softly in the grayness of the day 


and despite its seeming insub- 
stantiality it apparently had some 
strength — for it continued to push 
itself from the shattered mound 
until finally it stood free of it. 

Having freed itself, it drifted up 
toward the ledge. 

Strangely, Daniels felt no fear, 
only a vast curiosity. He tried to 
make out what the drifting shape 
was but he could not be sure. 

A S IT reached the ledge and 
moved slightly above it he 
drew back to crouch within the 
cave. The shape drifted in a cou- 
ple of feet or so and perched on 
the ledge — either perched upon it 
or floated just above it. 

You spoke, the sparkling shape 
said to Daniels. 

It was not a question, nor a 
statement either, really, and it was 
not really speaking. It sounded ex- 
actly like the talk Daniels had 
heard when he’d listened to the 
stars. 

You spoke to it, said the shape, 
as if you were a friend (although 
the word was not friend but some - 
thing else entirely, something 
warm and friendly ). You offered 
help to it. Is there help that you 
can give? 

That question at least was clear 
enough. 

“I don’t know,” said Daniels. 
“Not right now, there isn’t. But in 
a hundred years from now, per- 
haps — are you hearing me? Do 
you know what I am saying?” 


56 


IF 



You say there can be help , the 
creature said, but only after time. 
Please, what is that time? 

“A hundred years,” said Dan- 
iels. “When the planet goes around 
the star one hundred times.” 

One hundred? asked the crea- 
ture. 

Daniels held up the fingers of 
both hands. “Can you see my fin- 
gers? The appendages on the tips 
of my arms?” 

See? the creature asked. 

“Sense them. Count them.” 

Yes, / can count them. 

“They number ten,” said Dan- 
iels. “Ten times that many of 
them would be a hundred.” 

It is no great span of time, the 
creature said. What kind of help 
by then? 

“You know genetics? How a 
creature comes into being, how it 
knows what kind of thing it is to 
become, how it grows, how it 
knows how to grow and what to 
become. The amino acids that 
make up the ribonucleic acids and 
provide the key to the kind of cells 
it grows and. what their functions 
are.” 

I do not know your terms, the 
creature said, but I understand. So 
you know of this? You are not , 
then, a brute wild creature, like 
the other life that simply stands 
and the others that burrow in the 
ground and climb the standing life 
forms and run along the ground. 

It did not come out like this, of 
course. The words were there — or 


meanings that had the feel of 
words — but there were pictures as 
well of trees, of burrowing mice, 
of squirrels, of rabbits, of the lurch- 
ing woodchuck and the running 
fox. 

“Not I,” said Daniels, “but 
others of my kind. I know but lit- 
tle of it. There are others who 
spend all their time in the study of 
it.” 

The other perched on the ledge 
and said nothing more. Beyond it 
the trees whipped in the wind and 
the snow came whirling down. 
Daniels huddled back from the 
ledge, shivered in the cold and 
wondered if this thing upon the 
ledge could be hallucination. 

But as he thought it, the thing 
began to talk again, although this 
time it did not seem to be talking 
to him. It talked, rather, as the 
creature in the stone had talked, 
remembering. It communicated, 
perhaps, something he was not 
meant to know but Daniels had no 
way of keeping from knowing. 
Sentience flowed from the crea- 
ture and impacted on his mind, 
filling all his mind, barring all 
else, so that it seemed as if it were 
he and not this other who was re- 
membering. 

V 

F IRST there was space — end- 
less, limitless space, so far 
from everything, so brutal, so fri- 
gid, so uncaring that it numbed 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


57 



the mind, not so much from fear or 
loneliness, as- from the realization 
that in this eternity of space the 
thing that was himself was dwarfed 
to an insignificance no yardstick 
could measure. So far from home, 
so lost, so directionless — and yet 
not entirely directionless, for 
there was a trace, a scent, a spoor, 
a knowing that could not be ex- 
pressed or understood or even 
guessed at in the framework of 
humanity; a trace, a scent, a spoor 
that showed the way, no matter 
how dimly or how hopelessly, that 
something else had taken at some 
other time. And a mindless deter- 
mination, an unflagging devotion, 
a primal urgency that drove him 
on that faint, dim trail, to follow 
where it might lead, even to the 
end of time or space, or the both 
of them together, never to fail or 
quit or falter until the trail had fi- 
nally reached an end or had been 
wiped out by whatever winds might 
blow through empty space. 

There was something here, Dan- 
iels told himself, that, for all its 
alienness, still was familiar, a fac- 
tor that should lend itself to trans- 
lation into human terms and thus 
establish some sort of link between 
this remembering alien mind and 
his human mind. 

The emptiness and the silence, 
the cold uncaring went on and on 
and on and there seemed no end to 
it. But he came to understand 
there had to be an end to it and 
that the end was here, in these 


tangled hills above the ancient riv- 
er. And after the almost endless 
time of darkness and uncaring, an- 
other almost endless time of wait- 
ing, of having reached the end, of 
having gone as far as one might go 
and then settling down- to wait 
with an ageless patience that never 
would grow weary. 

You spoke of help, the creature 
said to him. Why help? You do not 
know this other. Why should you 
want to help ? 

“It is alive,” said Daniels. “It’s 
alive and I’m alive and is that not 
enough?” 

I do not know, the creature said. 

“I think it is,” said Daniels. 

And how could you help? 

“I’ve told you about this busi- 
ness of genetics. I don’t know if I 
can explain — ” 

/ have the terms from your 
mind , the creature said. The genet- 
ic code. 

“Would this other one, the one 
beneath the stone, the one you 
guard — ” 

Not guard , the creature said. 
The one I wait for. 

“You will wait for long.” 

I am equipped for waiting. I 
have waited long. I can wait much 
longer. 

“Someday,” Daniels said, “the 
stone will erode away. But you 
need not wait that long. Does this 
other creature know its genetic 
code?” 

It knows, the creature said. It 
knows far more than I. 


58 


IF 



“But all of it,” insisted Daniels. 
“Down to the last linkage, the fi- 
nal ingredient, the sequences of all 
the billions of — ” 

It knows, the creature said. The 
first requisite of all life is to under- 
stand itself. 

“And it could — it would — be 
willing to give us that information, 
to supply us its genetic code?” 

You are presumptuous, said the 
sparkling creature, (although the 
word was harsher than presump- 
tuous). That is information no 
thing gives another. It is indecent 
and obscene (here again the words 
were not exactly indecent and ob- 
scene). It involves the giving of 
one's self into another's hands. 
It is an ultimate and purposeless 
surrender. 

“Not surrender,” Daniels said. 
“A way of escaping from its im- 
prisonment. In time, in the hun- 
dred years of which I told you, the 
people of my race could take that 
genetic code and construct anoth- 
er creature exactly like the first. 
Duplicate it with exact precise- 
ness.” 

But it still would be in stone. 

“Only one of it. The original 
one. That original could wait for 
the erosion of the rock. But the 
other one, its duplicate, could take 
up life again.” 

And what, Daniels wondered, if 
the creature in the stone did not 
wish for rescue? What if it had de- 
liberately placed itself beneath the 
stone? What if it simply sought 


protection and sanctuary? Per- 
haps, if it wished, the creature 
could get out of where it was as 
easily as this other one — or this 
other thing — had risen from the 
mound. 

No, it cannot, said the creature 
squatting on the ledge. I was care- 
less. I went to sleep while waiting 
and I slept too long. 

And that would have been a 
long sleep, Daniels told himself. A 
sleep so long that dribbling soil 
had mounded over it, that fallen 
boulders, cracked off the cliff by 
frost, had been buried in the soil 
and that a clump of birch had 
sprouted and grown into trees 
thirty feet high. There was a dif- 
ference here in time rate that he 
could not comprehend. 

But some of the rest, he told 
himself, he had sensed — the de- 
voted loyalty and the mindless pa- 
tience of the creature that tracked 
another far among the stars. He 
knew he was right, for the mind of 
that other thing, that devoted star- 
dog perched upon the ledge, came 
into him and fastened on his mind 
and for a moment the two of them, 
the two minds, for all their differ- 
ences, merged into a single mind in 
a gesture of fellowship and basic 
understanding, as if for the first 
time in what must have been mil- 
lions of years this baying hound 
from outer space had found a 
creature that could understand its 
duty and its purpose. 

“We could try to dig it out,” 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


59 



said Daniels. “I had thought of 

that, of course, but I was afraid 

that it would be injured. And it 

would be hard to convince any- 
* * 

one — 

No, said the creature, digging 
would not do. There is much you 
do not understand. But this other „ 
proposal that you have, that has 
great merit. You say you do not 
have the knowledge oj genetics to 
take this action now. Have you 
talked to others oj your kind? 

“I talked to one,” said Daniels, 
“and he would not listen. He 
thought I was mad: But he was 
not, after all, the man I should 
have spoken to. In time I could 
talk with others but not right now. 
No matter how much I might 
want to — I can’t. For they would 
laugh at me and I could not stand 
their laughter. But jn a hundred 
years or somewhat less I could — ” 

But you will not exist a hun- 
dred years, said the faithful dog. 
You are a short-lived species. 
Which might explain your rapid 
rise. All life here is short-lived and 
that gives evolution a chance to 
build intelligence. When I first 
came here I found but mindless 
entities. 

“You are right,” said Daniels. 
“I can live no hundred years. Even 
from the very start, I could not 
live a hundred years and better 
than half of my life is gone. Per- 
haps much more than half of it. For 
unless I can get out of this cave I 
will be dead in days.” 


Reach out, said the sparkling 
one. Reach out and touch me, be- 
ing. 

Slowly Daniels reached out. His 
hand went through the sparkle and 
the shine and he had no sense of 
matter — it was as if he’d moved his 
hand through nothing but air. 

You see, the creature said, I 
cannot help you. There is no way 
for our energies to interact. I am 
sorry, friend. (It was not friend, 
exactly, but it was good enough, 
and it might have been, Daniels 
thought, a great deal more than 
friend.) 

“I am sorry, too,” said Daniels. 
“I would like to live.” 


S ILENCE fell between them, the 
soft and brooding silence of a 
snow-laden afternoon with noth- 
ing but the trees and the rock and 
the hidden little life to share the si- 
lence with them. 

It had been for nothing, then, 
Daniels told himself, this meeting 
with a creature from another 
world. Unless he could somehow 
get off this ledge there was nothing 
he could do. Although why he 
should so concern himself with the 
rescue of the creature in the stone 
he could not understand. Surely 
whether he himself lived or died 
should be of more importance to 
him than that his death would fore- 
close any chance of help to the 
buried alien. 

“But it may not be for nothing,” 


60 


IF 



he told the sparkling creature. 
“Now that you know — ” 

My knowing, said the creature, 
will have no effect. There are oth- 
ers from the stars who would have 
the knowledge — but even if I could 
contact them they would pay no 
attention to me. My position is too 
lowly to converse with the greater 
ones. My only hope would be 
people of your kind and, if Tm not 
mistaken, only with yourself. For 
I catch the edge of thought that 
you are the only one who really 
understands. There is no other of 
your race who could even be aware 
of me. 

Daniels nodded. It was entirely 
true. No other human existed 
whose brain had been jumbled so 
fortunately as to have acquired the 
abilities he held. He was the only 
hope for the creature in the stone 
and even such hope as he repre- 
sented might be very slight, for 
before it could be made effective he 
must find someone who would 
listen and believe. And that belief 
must reach across the years to a 
time when genetic engineering was 
considerably advanced beyond its 
present state. 

If you could manage to survive 
the present crisis, said the hound 
from outer space, I might bring to 
bear certain energies and tech- 
niques — sufficiently for the project 
to be carried through. But, as you 
must realize, I cannot supply the 
means to survive this crisis. 

“Someone may come along,” 


said Daniels. “They might hear me 
if I yelled every now and then.” 

He began yelling every now and 
then and received no answer. His 
yells were muffled by the storm 
and it was unlikely, he knew, that 
there would be men abroad at a 
time like this. They’d be safe be- 
side their fires. 

The sparkling creature still 
perched upon the ledge when Dan- 
iels slumped back to rest. The oth- 
er made an indefinite sort of shape 
that seemed much like a lopsided 
Christmas tree standing in the 
snow. 

Daniels told himself not to go to 
sleep. He must close his eyes only 
for a moment, then snap them 
open — he must not let them stay 
shut for then sleep would come 
upon him. He should beat his arms 
across his chest for warmth — but 
his arms were heavy and did not 
want to work. 

He felt himself sliding prone to 
the cave floor and fought to drive 
himself erect. But his will to fight 
was thin and # the rock was com- 
fortable. So comfortable, he 
thought, that he could afford a 
moment’s rest before forcing him- 
self erect. And the funny thing 
about it was that the cave floor 
had turned to mud and water and 
the sun was shining and he seemed 
warm again. 

He rose with a start and he saw 
that he was standing in a wide ex- 
panse of water no deeper than his 
ankles, black ooze underfoot. 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


61 



T HERE was no cave and no hill 
in which the cave might be. 
There was simply this vast sheet of 
water and behind him, less than 
thirty feet away, the muddy beach 
of a tiny island — a muddy, rocky 
island, with smears of sickly green 
clinging to the rocks. 

He was in another time, he 
knew, but not in another place. 
Always when he slipped through 
time he came to rest on exactly 
the same spot upon the surface of 
the earth that he had occupied 
when the change had come. 

And standing there he wondered 
once again, as he had many times 
before, what strange mechanism 
operated to shift him bodily in 
space so that when he was trans- 
ported to a time other than his 
own he did not find himself buried 
under, say, twenty feet of rock or 
soil or suspended twenty feet 
above the surface. 

But now, he knew, was no time 
to think or wonder. By a strange 
quirk of circumstance he was no 
longer in the cave and it made 
good sense to get away from where 
he was as swiftly as he could. For 
if he stayed standing where he was 
he might snap back unexpectedly 
to his present and find himself still 
huddled in the cave. 

He turned clumsily about, his 
feet tangling in the muddy bottom, 
and lunged toward the shore. The 
going was hard but he made it and 
went up the slimy stretch of mud- 
dy beach until he could reach the 


tumbled rocks and could sit and 
rest. 

His breathing was difficult. He 
gulped great lungfuls and the air 
had a strange taste to it, not like 
normal air. 

He sat on the rock, gasping for 
breath and gazed out across the 
sheet of water shining in the high, 
warm sun. Far out he caught sight 
of a long, humping swell and 
watched it coming in. When it 
reached the shore it washed up the 
muddy incline almost to his feet. 
Far out on the glassy surface an- 
other swell was forming. 

The sheet of water was greater, 
he realized, than he had first ima- 
gined. This was also the first time 
in his wanderings through the past 
that he had ever come upon any 
large body of water. Always before 
he had emerged on dry land whose 
general contours had been recog- 
nizable — and there had always 
been the river flowing through the 
hills. 

Here nothing was recognizable. 
This was a totally different place 
and there could be no question that 
he had been projected farther back 
in time than ever before— back to 
the day of some great epiconti- 
nental sea, back to a time, per- 
haps, when the atmosphere had 
far less oxygen than it would have 
in later eons. More than likely, he 
thought, he was very close in time 
to that boundary line where life for 
a creature such as he would be im- 
possible. Here there apparently 


62 


IF 



was sufficient oxygen, although a 
man must pump more air into his 
lungs than he would normally. Go 
back a few million years and the 
oxygen might fall to the point 
where it would be insufficient. Go 
a little farther back and find no 
free oxygen at all. 

Watching the beach, he saw the 
little things skittering back and 
forth, seeking refuge in spume- 
whitened piles of drift or popping 
into tiny burrows. He put his hand 
down on the rock on which he sat 
and scrubbed gently at a patch of 
green. It slid off the rock and clung 
to his flesh, smearing his palm with 
a slimy gellatinous mess that felt 
disgusting and unclean. 

Here, then, was the first of life to 
dwell upon the land — scarcely 
creatures as yet, still clinging to 
the edge of water, afraid and un- 
equipped to wander too far from 
the side of that wet and gentle 
mother which, from the first begin- 
ning, had nurtured life. Even the 
plants still clung close to the sea, 
existing, perhaps, only upon rocky 
surfaces so close to the beach that 
occasional spray could reach them. 

Daniels found that now he did 
not have to gasp quite so much for 
breath. Plowing through the mud 
up to the rock had been exhaust- 
ing work iji an oxygen-poor at- 
mosphere. But sitting quietly on 
the rock, he could get along all 
right. 

Now that the blood had stopped 
pounding in his head he became 


aware of silence. He heard one 
sound only, the soft lapping of the 
water against the muddy beach, a 
lonely effect that seemed to em- 
phasize rather than break the si- 
lence. 

Never before in his life, he real- 
ized, had he heard so little sound. 
Back in the other worlds he had 
known there had been not one 
noise, but many, even on the quiet- 
est days. But here there was noth- 
ing to make a sound — no trees, no 
animals, no insects, no birds — just 
the water running to the far hori- 
zon and the bright sun in the sky. 

For the first time in many 
months he knew again that sense of 
out-of-placeness, of not belonging, 
the feeling of being where he was 
not wanted and had no right to be, 
an intruder in a world that was out 
of bounds, not for him alone but 
for anything that was more com- 
plex or more sophisticated than the 
little skitterers on the beach. 

He sat beneath the alien sun, 
surrounded by the alien water, 
watching the little things that in 
eons yet to come would give rise 
to such creatures as himself, and 
tried to feel some sort of kinship 
to the skitterers. But he could feel 
no kinship. 


A ND suddenly in this place of 
one-sound-only there came a 
throbbing, faint but clear and 
presently louder, pressing down 
against the water, beating at the 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


63 



little island — a sound out of the 
sky. 

Daniels leaped to his feet and 
looked up and the ship was there, 
plummeting down toward him. 
But not a ship of solid form, it 
seemed — rather a distorted thing, 
as if many planes of light (if there 
could be such things as planes of 
light) had been slapped together in 
a haphazard sort of way. 

A throbbing came from it that 
set the atmosphere to howling and 
the planes of light kept changing 
shape or changing places, so that 
the ship, from one moment to the 
next, never looked the same. 

It had been dropping fast to 
start with but now it was slowing 
down as it continued to fall, pon- 
derously and with massive delib- 
eration, straight toward the is- 
land. 

Daniels found himself crouch- 
ing, unable to jerk his eyes and 
senses away from this mass of 
light and thunder that came out of 
the sky. 

The sea and mud and rock, even 
in the full light of the sun, were 
flickering with the flashing that 
came from the shifting of the 
planes of light. Watching it 
through eyes squinted against the 
flashes, Daniels saw that if the 
ship were to drop to the surface it 
would not drop upon the island, as 
he first had feared, but a hundred 
feet or so offshore. 

Not more than fifty feet above 
the water the great ship stopped 


and hovered and a bright thing 
came from it. The object hit the 
water with a splash but did not go 
under, coming to rest upon the 
shallow, muddy bottom of the sea, 
with a bit less than half of it above 
the surface. It was a sphere, a 
bright and shiny globe against 
which the water lapped, and even 
with the thunder of the ship beat- 
ing at his ears, Daniels imagined he 
could hear the water lapping at the 
sphere. 

Then a voice spoke above this 
empty world, above the throbbing 
of the ship, the imagined lapping 
sound of water, a sad, judicial 
voice — although it could not have 
been a voice, for any voice would 
have been too puny to be heard. 
But the words were there and there 
was no doubt of what they said: 

Thus, according to the verdict 
and the sentence, you are here de- 
ported and abandoned upon this 
barren planet, where it is most de- 
voutly hoped you will find the 
time and opportunity to contem- 
plate your sins and especially the 
sin of (and here were words and 
concepts Daniels could not under- 
stand, hearing them only as a blur 
of sound— but the sound of them, 
or something in the sound of them, 
was such as to turn his blood to ice 
and at the same time fill him with 
a disgust and a loathing such as 
he’d never known before). It is re- 
grettable, perhaps, that you are im- 
mune to death, for much as we 
might detest ourselves for doing it, 


64 


IF 



it would be a kinder course to dis- 
continue you and would serve bet- 
ter than this course to exact our 
purpose, which is to place you be- 
yond all possibility of ever having 
contact with any sort of life again . 
Here, beyond the farthest track 
of galactic intercourse, on this un- 
charted planet, we can only hope 
jhat our purpose will be served. 
And we urge upon you such self- 
examination that if, by some re- 
mote chance, in some unguessed 
time, you should be freed through 
ignorance or malice, you shall find 
it within yourself so to conduct 
your existence as not to meet or 
merit such fare again. And now , 
according to our law, you may 
speak any final words you wish. 

The voice ceased and after a 
while came another. And while the 
terminology was somewhat more 
involved than Daniels could grasp 
their idiom translated easily into 
human terms. 

Go screw yourself , it said. 

The throbbing deepened and the 
ship began to move straight up into 
the sky. Daniels watched it until 
the thunder died and the ship it- 
self was a fading twinkle in the 
blue. 

He rose from his crouch and 
stood erect, trembling and weak. 
Groping behind him for the rock, 
he found it and sat down again. 

Once again the only sound was 
the lapping of the water on the 
shore. He could not hear, as he had 
imagined that he could, the water 


against the shining sphere that lay 
a hundred feet offshore. The sun 
blazed down out of the sky and 
glinted on the sphere and Daniels 
found that once again he was gasp- 
ing for his breath. 

Without a doubt, out there in 
the shallow water, on the mud- 
bank that sloped up to the island, 
lay the creature in the stone. And 
how then had it been possible for 
him to be transported across the 
hundreds of millions of years to 
this one microsecond of time that 
held the answer to all the questions 
he had asked about the intelligence 
beneath the limestone? It could not 
have been sheer coincidence, for 
this was coincidence of too large 
an order ever to come about. Had 
he somehow, subconsciously, 
gained more knowledge than he 
had been aware of from the twink- 
ling creature that had perched 
upon the ledge? For a moment, he 
remembered, their minds had met 
and mingled — at that moment had 
there occurred a transmission of 
knowledge, unrecognized, buried 
in some subconscious corner of 
himself? Or was he witnessing the 
operation some sort of psychic 
warning system set up to scare off 
any future intelligence that might 
be tempted to liberate this aban- 
doned and marooned being? 

And what about the twinkling 
creature? Could some hidden, un- 
guessed good exist in the thing im- 
prisoned in the sphere — for it to 
have commanded the loyalty and 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


65 



devotion of the creature on the 
ledge beyond the slow erosion of 
geologic ages? The question raised 
another: What were good and evil? 
Who was there to judge? 

The evidence of the twinkling 
creature was, of course, no evi- 
dence at all. No human being was 
so utterly depraved that he could 
not hope to find a dog to follow 
him and guard him even to the 
death. 

More to wonder at was what 
had happened within his own 
jumbled brain that could send him 
so unerringly to the moment of a 
vital happening. What more would 
he find in it to astonish and con- 
found him? How far along the path 
to ultimate understanding might it 


drive him? And what was the pur- 
pose of that driving? 

He sat on the rock and gasped 
for breath. The sea lay flat and 
calm beneath the blazing sun, its 
only motion the long swells run- 
ning in to break around the sphere 
and on the beach. The little skitter- 
ing creatures ran along the mud 
and he rubbed his palm against his 
trouser leg, trying to brush off the 
green and slimy scum. 

He could wade out, he thought, 
and have a closer look at the sphere 
lying in the mud. But it would be a 
long walk in such an atmosphere 
and he could not chance it — for he 
must be nowhere near the cave up 
in that distant future when he 
popped back to his present. 


Once the excitement of knowing 
where he was, the sense of out-of- 
placeness, had worn off, this tiny 
mud-flat island was a boring place. 
There was nothing but the sky and 
sea and the muddy beach; there was 
nothing much to look at. It was a 
place, he thought, where nothing 
ever happened, or was about to hap- 
pen once the ship had gone away 
and the great event had ended. 
Much was going on, of course, that 
in future ages would spell out to 
quite a lot — but it was mostly hap- 
pening out of sigh, down at the 
bottom of this shallow sea. The 
skittering things, he thought, and 
the slimy growth upon the rock 
were hardy, mindless pioneers of 
this distant day — awesome to look 


upon and think about but actually 
not too interesting. 

He began drawing aimless pat- 
terns in the mud with the toe of 
one boot. He tried to make a tic- 
tac-toe layout but so much mud 
was clinging to his toe that it didn’t 
quite come out. 

A ND then, instead of drawing 
in the mud, he was scraping 
with his toe in fallen leaves, stiff 
with frozen sleet and snow. 

The sun was gone and the scene 
was dark except for a glow from 
something in the woods just down 
the hill from him. Driving sheets 
of snow swirled into his face and 
he shivered. He pulled his jacket 
close about him and began to but- 



THE THING IN THE STONE 


67 


ton it. A man, he thought, could 
catch his death of cold this way, 
shifting as quickly as he had shifted 
from a steaming mudbank to the 
whiplash chill of a northern bliz- 
zard. 

The yellow glow still persisted 
on the slope below him and he 
could hear the sound of human 
voices. What was going on? He 
was fairly certain of where he was, 
a hundred feet or so above the 
place where the cliff began — there 
should be no one down there; there 
should not be a light. 

He took a slow step down the 
hill, then hesitated. He ought not 
to be going down the hill — he 
should be heading straight for 
home. The cattle would be waiting 
at the barnyard gate, hunched 
against the storm, their coats cov- 
ered with ice and snow, yearning 
for the warmth and shelter of the 
barn. The pigs would not have been 
fed, nor the chickens either. A man 
owed some consideration to his 
livestock. 

But someone was down there, 
someone with a lantern, almost on 
the lip of the cliff. If the damn fools 
didn’t watch out, they could slip 
and go plunging down into a hun- 
dred feet of space. Coon hunters 
more than likely, although this was 
not the kind of night to be out 
hunting coon. The coons would all 
be denned up. 

But whoever they might be, he 
should go down and warn them. 

He was halfway to the lantern, 


which appeared to be setting on 
the ground, when someone picked 
it up and held it high and Daniels 
saw and recognized the face of the 
man who held it. 

Daniels hurried forward. 

“Sheriff, what are you doing 
here?” 

But he had the shamed feeling 
that he knew, that he should have 
known from the moment he had 
seen the light. 

“Who is there?” the sheriff 
asked, wheeling swiftly and tilting 
the lantern so that its rays were 
thrown in Daniels’ direction.” 
“Daniels,” he gasped. “Good God, 
man, where have you been?” 

“Just walking around,” said 
Daniels weakly. The answer, he 
knew, was no good at all — but 
how could he tell anyone that he 
had just returned from a trip 
through time? 

“Damn it,” the sheriff said, dis- 
gusted. “We’ve been hunting you. 
Ben Adams got scared when he 
dropped over to your place and you 
weren’t there. He knows how you 
go walking around in the woods 
and he was afraid something had 
happened to you. So he phoned me, 
and he and his boys began look- 
ing for you. We were afraid you 
had fallen or had been hurt some- 
how. A man wouldn’t last the 
night in a storm liker this.” 

“Where is Ben now?’’ asked 
Daniels. 

The sheriff gestured down the 
hill and Daniels saw that two men, 


68 


IF 



probably Adams’ sons, had a rope 
snubbed around a tree and that the 
rope extended down over the cliff. 

“He’s down on the rope,” the 
sheriff said. “Having a look in the 
cave. He felt somehow you might 
be in the cave.’’ 

“He had good reason to — ’’ 
Daniels started to say but he had 
barely begun to speak when the 
night was rent by a shriek of terror. 
The shrieking did not stop. It kept 
on and on. The sheriff thrust the 
lantern at Daniels and hurried for- 
ward. 

No guts, Daniels thought. A 
man who could be vicious enough 
to set up another for death, to trap 
him in a cave — but who, when the 
chips were down, could not go 
through with it and had to phone 
the sheriff to provide a witness to 
his good intentions — a man like 
that lacked guts. 

The shrieks had fallen to moan- 
ing. The sheriff hauled on the rope, 
helped by one of Adams’ sons. A 
man’s head and shoulders ap- 
peared above the clifftop and the 
sheriff reached out and hauled him 
to safety. 

Ben Adams collapsed on the 
ground and never stopped his 
moaning. The sheriff jerked him to 
his feet. 

“What’s the matter, Ben?’’ 

“There’s something down 
there,’’ Adams screamed. “There 
is something in the cave — ’’ 

“Something, damn it? What 
would it be? A cat? A panther?’’ 


“I never seen it. I just knew that 
it was there. I felt it. It was 
crouched back inside the cave.’’ 
“How could anything be in 
there? Someone cut down the tree. 
How could anything get into the 
cave?’’ 

“I don’t know,’’ howled Adams. 
“It might have been in there when 
the tree was cut. It might have 
been trapped in there.’’ 

One of the sons was holding Ben 
erect and the sheriff moved away. 
The other son was pulling in the 
rope and neatly coiling it. 

“Another thing,’’ the sheriff 
said, “how come you thought Dan- 
iels might be in that cave? If the 
tree was cut down he couldn’t have 
climbed the tree. And he couldn’t 
have used a rope the way you did, 
for there wasn’t any rope. If he 
had used a rope it would still have 
been there. I don’t know what’s 
going on — damned if I do. You 
down messing in that cave and 
Daniels comes walking out of the 
woods. I wish someone would tell 
me. 

Adams, who had been hobbling 
forward, saw Daniels for the first 
time and came to a sudden halt. 

“Where did you come from?’’ 
he demanded. “Here we been 
wearing out our guts trying to hunt 
you down and then — ’’ 

“Oh, go on home,’’ the sheriff 
said in a disgusted tone of voice. 
“There’s a fishy smell to this. It’s 
going to take me a little while to 
get it figured out.’’ 


THE THING IN THE STONE 


69 



Daniels reached out his hand to 
the son who had finished coiling 
the rope. 

“I believe that’s my rope,” he 
said. 

Without protest, taken by sur- 
prise, the boy handed it to him. 

“We’ll cut across the woods,” 
said Ben. “Home’s closer that 
way.” 

“Good night, men,” the sheriff 
said. 

Slowly the sheriff and Daniels 
climbed the hill. 

“T^ANIELS,” said the sheriff, 

U “you were never out walk- 
ing in this storm. If you had been 
you’d have had a whole lot more 
snow on you than shows. You look 
like you just stepped from a 
house.” 

“Maybe I wasn’t exactly walk- 
ing around,” Daniels said. 

“Would you mind telling me 
where you were? I don’t mind do- 
ing my duty as I see it but I don’t 
relish being made to look a fool 
while I’m doing it.” 

“Sheriff, I can’t tell you. I’m 
sorry. I simply cannot tell you.” 

“All right, then. What about the 
rope?” 

“It’s my rope,” said Daniels. 
“I lost it this afternoon.” 

“And I suppose you can’t tell 
me about that, either.” 

“No, I guess I can’t.” 

“You know,” the sheriff said, 
“I’ve had a lot of trouble with Ben 
Adams through the years. I’d hate 


to think I was going to have trou- 
ble with you, too.” 

They climbed the hill and walked 
up to the house. The sheriff’s car 
was parked out on the road. 

“Would you come in?” asked 
Daniels. “I could find a drink.” 

The sheriff shook his head. 
“Some other time,” he said. “May- 
be soon. You figure there was 
something in that cave? Or was it 
just Ben’s imagination? He’s a 
flighty sort of critter.” 

“Maybe there wasn’t anything,” 
said Daniels, “but if Ben thought 
there was, what difference does it 
make? Thinking it might be just as 
real as if there were something 
there. All of us, sheriff, live with 
things walking by our sides no one 
else can see.” 

The sheriff shot a quick glance 
at him. “Daniels, what’s with 
you?” he asked. “What is walking 
by your side or sniffing at your 
heels? Why did you bury yourself 
out here in this God-forsaken 
place? What is going on?” 

He didn’t wait for an answer. 
He got into his car, started it and 
headed down the road. 

Daniels stood in the storm and 
watched the glowing taillights van- 
ish in the murk of flying snow. He 
shook his head in bewilderment. 
The sheriff had asked a question 
and then had not waited for the 
answer. Perhaps because it was a 
question to which he did not want 
an answer.

Apr. 18, S.D. 1125 
Commissioner, Planetary Zoo 
Morenull III 
Sector 21 

Sir: 

Congratulations on your deci- 
sion to purchase a specimen of 
the most dangerous animal in the 
known universe. 

The Rigellian wombat is with- 
out a doubt the most powerful 
and deadly lifeform yet discov- 
ered by man, and as such is an ad- 
dition of which any zoo may be 
justly proud. The ability of a 
wombat to attract visitors is more 
than ample compensation for the 
price of purchase, while the bene- 
fits that the biologists of your 
planet may derive from the avail- 
ability of a live specimen are truly 
incalculable. In short, you have 
made an excellent buy. 

We wish you to remember, 
however, that we of the Malison 
Company do feel a great sense of 
responsibility toward our custom- 
ers and their patrons. Thus it will 
be impossible for us to deliver 
your wombat until we are satisfied 
that your zoo has the facilities 
necessary for the proper care and 
containment of the animal. The 
required equipment is described 
in detail in the accompanying en- 
closures but I would like to dis- 
cuss it here as well, so that you 
may be absolutely clear on what is 
needed for the safety and comfort 
of your specimen and your guests. 


The wombat must be com- 
pletely enclosed in a cage of Dor- 
cas force fields and special care 
should be taken with the fields in 
areas where they overlap. Please 
note that the floor of the cage 
must be given the same protec- 
tion as the other parts — even ten 
feet of reinforced concrete is no 
insurance of safety where wom- 
bats are concerned, as we of the 
Malison Company know only too 
well. The precise power require- 
ments vary from case to case but 
you will find minimum standards 
for most applications in the en- 
closures. These should run a few 
megawatts, at most. 

If you wish, you may buy the 
generators for the Dorcas fields 
directly from us — already per- 
fectly adapted for use as wombat 
cages — at a price other dealers 
cannot hope to match. Whether 
or not you choose to buy from 
us, our experts are always avail- 
able for help in assembling and 
installing the cages. Whatever 
your arrangements for confining 
your wombat, as soon as your fa- 
cilities meet the specifications 
which, in all good conscience, we 
feel obliged to set, we will rush 
you the animal by means of our 
own specially equipped transport 
ship. 

Should you meet with difficul- 
ties anywhere in your enterprise 
our experts are always available 
for consultation. Remember that 
since we deal only in wombats, we

Dear Sir: 

I am delighted to hear that 
your wombat is proving to be a 
successful addition to the More- 
null Zoo. The reports we have 
received so far furnish gratifying 
proof that there is no creature in 
the cosmos better able to capture 
the public’s imagination than one 
of our wombats. Your response 
has helped to assure us that we 
are doing everything possible for 
the satisfaction of our customers. 

As to your complaints about the 
shipping charges, we find it re- 
grettable that the increased rates 
were necessary but they were 
forced upon us by circumstances 
completely outside our control. 
Rising operating costs and crew’s 


wages, due mainly to the stricter 
provisions of the new Lifeform 
Transport Law, made these in- 
creases necessary. If you are in 
doubt as to the legality of our 
action please note clause 23 of 
your contract. We are quite with- 
in our rights on this matter. In 
any case, the few thousand credits 
involved are of little consequence 
when compared with the immense 
benefits which you are by now 
enjoying due to your wombat. 

It has been a pleasure serving 
you and if there is any further 
aid we can supply, please let us 
know. 

Sincerely, 
C. J. Malison

Sir: 

In keeping with our policy of 
continuing service in depth, we 
are happy to inform you that our 
research staff has completed its 
analysis of the available data on 
the recent wombat escapes on 
Lurda IV and Denel II. Although 
the data in such cases are neces- 
sarily fragmentary, the analysis 
does seem to indicate that the 
containing fields were somewhat 
underpowered. Our suggested 
power ratings have been raised 
accordingly (see enclosures). If 
you wish to modify your equip-

ment to comply with these new 
specifications you may buy the 
necessary hardware directly from 
us and we will be happy to send 
you one of our technical experts 
to help with the modifications. 
These are only two of the many 
services which we offer at nomi- 
nal fees in order that each of our 
customers may display his wom- 
bat with the maximum of safety 
and convenience. 

Ever striving to be of service, I

Sincerely yours,

September 9, S. D. 1 1 25

Sir: 

Naturally I am quite distressed 
to hear of the escape of your 
wombat. 

The property damage and loss 
of life are, of course, regrettable 
and I sympathize with the fact 
that the whole affair was made no 
easier to tolerate by the arrival of 
my last letter the day after the es- 
cape. Even so, you have no 
grounds on which to bring suit 
against the Malison Company and 
if you will consult your lawyers 
you may see fit to withdraw this 
impulsive action. 

In any case, we are always 
ready to help you with the recap- 
ture and confinement of your 


wombat and to that end I recom- 
mend that you enlist the aid of 
our expert capture team. Natur- 
ally this should be done at once, 
before the wombat does any more 
. damage. Of course, the capture of 
a wombat on an inhabited planet 
is a somewhat expensive operation 
but I am sure you agree that the 
property and lives that can be 
saved by prompt action are much 
more important than mere mone- 
tary considerations. Due to the 
dangers involved in their work 
the capture team must obviously 
be paid in advance — but we are 
standing ready to dispatch them 
the instant we receive your check. 

Good luck — and if there is any- 
thing else we can do to help you 
out of this difficult situation, 
please let us know. 

Sincerely, 
C. J. Malison 
P. S. Naturally I do not like to 
press the point at this time, but 
the last payment on your Dorcas 
field generators is overdue, f hope 
you will attend to this matter as 
soon as possible. 

September 21, S. D. 1125 
Commissioner, Planetary Zoo 
Morenull III 
Sector 21 

Sir: 

Perhaps I did not make suffi- 
ciently clear the dangers implicit 
in the continued existence of a 
free, unhampered wombat on an 


74 


IF 



inhabited planet. It is plain, at 
least, that you have not talked 
with the beast’s caretaker or ob- 
served its behavior during feeding 
month — else you would not have 
taken so lightly the suggestion of- 
fered in my last letter. 

Whether to use our capture 
team is, of course, up to you. But 
the terms of your refusal and your 
allegations concerning our mo- 
tives were impudent and uncalled 
for. It is worth remembering that 
if the wombat’s next feeding per- 
iod (coming up in about two 
months, our records show) ar- 
rives before the animal is cap- 
tured, then sending for the cap- 
ture team will be very much a 
preliminary step. That step might 
best be followed by closing down 
all of your carpentry schools and 
birth-control centers, as there will 
be neither a housing shortage nor 
population pressure on your plan- 
et for some time to come. I hope 
I make myself perfectly clear. 

As to the animal’s capture, there 
are several methods, some safer 
than others. The safest, of course, 
is to let our professional capture 
team do the job for you. I cannot 
understand why you are so ada- 
mant in your opposition to this 
proposal — but if you have decided 
not to use all the resources at your 
disposal there is certainly nothing 
I can do about it. With reference 
to other methods of capture, I can 
only state the facts concerning a 
few prodecures, with most of 


which, to be sure, you already are 
acquainted. 

Wombats are essentially im- 
mune to most of the weapons of 
the modern military short of nu- 
clear warheads, but a sufficient 
concentration of conventional 
firepower will sometimes discour- 
age the animal and make subse- 
quent steps in the capture some- 
what easier. Caution must be 
used, however, since a well-fed 
and well-treated wombat such as 
are found in zoos is often very 
resistant to such methods. The ac- 
tual capture can sometimes be ef- 
fected by sandwiching the wom- 
bat between the defensive screens 
of two ships of the line (Mk. IV 
cruisers, or heavier). I note that 
your planet does not maintain a 
navy of its own but perhaps one of 
your neighboring systems could 
be prevailed upon to help. If not, 
we will be happy to sell you 
enough trimatrocine isomer 3, the 
wombat tranquilizing gas, to spray 
an area of a hundred square kilo- 
meters. This should stop your 
wombat if all else fails — but 
please remember that this is very 
potent, stable and elusive stuff 
and as such may be expected to 
have quite an effect on your plan- 
et’s water ecology. Be careful with 
it. 

Your debt on the Dorcas field 
generators is still unpaid. 

Sincerely, 
C.J. Malison

Dec. 12, S.D. 1125

Sector 21 
Sir: 

You treat the Malison Company 
most unfairly. 

We agree that the circum- 
stances involving your wombat 
have been in some ways quite un- 
fortunate but we feel that there is 
no justification for your violent 
assaults on our integrity. Your 
charges that we were “negligent” 
and “mercenary” are, we feel, es- 
pecially ill-founded and we hope 
that you will see fit to retract 
these harsh words after your tem- 
per has subsided. Be assured, 
however, that even if you persist 
in your childish efforts to have 
the government indict us, we will 
harbor no resentment and will be 
quite happy to settle out of court 
for the unpaid balance on the 
wombat cages which you de- 
stroyed along with the wombat. 

In many ways the destruction 
of the wombat was the most re- 
grettable event of all, since with 
a little foresight it could have 
been entirely avoided. We 
warned you to make sure that the 
wombat was in the area to be 
gassed before dropping the tran- 
quilizer — but wombats are very 
tricky creatures and I suppose 
mistakes will happen. After that 
fiasco the approach of the wom- 
bat’s feeding period naturally 
made the use of nuclear weapons 


your only choice. Even a zoo and 
a few evacuated suburbs is a small 
price to pay for the avoidance of 
a hungry wombat. But the whole 
affair would have been so much 
easier if you had called in our cap- 
ture team at the beginning. The 
monetary cost would have been 
much lower and at least the ani- 
mal would have been preserved. 

Also, I am truly sorry that we 
did not foresee the effect of the 
tranquilizing gas on the animal 
life of your planet. You must un- 
derstand, however, that it was a 
natural mistake. Those of us who 
deal exclusively in wombats tend 
to forget that there are animals 
besides man that drink water and 
are not immune to the lethal ef- 
fects of the chemical. I would like 
to add that I am relieved to hear 
that the human situation is not so 
bad, since the water you import 
from Lyrantha VI is reportedly of 
the very highest quality. 

Finally, let me remind you that 
we bear no grudges because of 
your sometimes temperamental 
behavior and whenever you wish 
to replace your wombat, remem- 
ber that we are the most reliable 
firm in the business. 

Hoping for more enjoyable 
business dealings in the near fu- 
ture, I remain, 

Very sincerely yours,

S he was nineteen, nondescript, 
blond, face and body still pudgy 
with baby fat. But she had the tal- 
ent. Like no one else, she thought. 
I’m alone. 

Words appeared on the paper 
under her hand: “I live in a 
silent world where no one can 
enter or love. There are no locks, 
doors orJceys. Only an empty for- 
est where I can walk and see the

Julie sighed. She took the paper 
into her hands and slowly ripped it, 
letting the pieces flutter from the 
desk. The hot morning and the 
written words and the act were typ- 
ical of Julie. 

But this morning the voice came, 
after nineteen years of silence. She 
had not yet heard it. She had taken 
her usual seat in the back row and 
neatly spread the spiral notebook 
in front of her, prepared to watch 
the shadows of the professor’s 
words. 

“The French symbolists,” in- 
toned the professor, displaying his 
easy plastic smile, “could discover 
a strange beauty in seemingly con- 
tradictory places. Witness, for ex- 
ample, Baudelaire’s ‘A Car- 
rion — ’ ” 

The words rumbled meaningless- 
ly in Julie’s ears. The pen between 
her fingers made random scratches 
across the pad. Go ahead, said her 
mind. The bored girl let her brain 
reach out across the still heat of 


the room to pick up the thought 
currents beneath the professor’s 
words.

and felt the silky rub of her stock- 
inged thighs. I’m blushing, she 
thought with chagrin, though she 
knew she wasn’t the girl in the 
professor’s mental image. That 
picture in his head . 

Nineteen years of mental eaves- 
dropping fell heavily on Julie. I’ll 
never get used to the pain in their 
minds, she thought. So often 
they’ve driven me inside my shield. 
Nineteen years and Julie had never 
met another person with the talent 
she possessed. All the people of the 
world who talk only through their 
lips, she thought, and then there’s 
me. 

hey! heyjulie 

The voice was in her head. Julie 
looked up, shocked.

The faces of her classmates were 
glazed in identical boredom. 

no julie i’m not in your class 

Confused, Julie sat frozen. Her 
pen dropped unnoticed to the floor.

Julie concentrated, tried to think 
coherently.

mind

no! 

“No!” 

The boy beside Julie looked at 
her. The professor hesitated, went 
on with his lecture. 
no no no 

The linked, dark halls of Julie’s 
mind echoed convulsively. Dazed 
with the shock of encounter, she 
panicked. Someone was moving 
slowly through the open field be- 
side her pine forest. Stalking her. 

someone's reaching into me 
no get out please get 
out of my mind 

calm down julie steady now 
just take it easy girl i’m not 
intruding just talking to you 
yes yes i’m okay 

The panic faded, replaced by a 
chaos of confusing sensations. 

/ feel like crying and laughing 
and screaming all at once you 
know 

The terror merged with an alien 
and gradually overpowering emo- 
tion. 

Unbelieving, Julie recognized it 
as hope. 

please i can’t control this 
i’m sorry god the pain 
my loneliness i thought i 
was the only one 
i know 

Julie’s thought was contrite. 
i’m sorry i was afraid can’t 
think can’t concentrate who 

are you how did you 

find me.

time i know it’s a shock 
should have been more cautious 
shouldn’t have barged in like that 
when i picked up that shout of 
yours about loneliness but i 

couldn’t help it you’re the first 
i’m glad so happy happy 

The barrier of ice, long lodged 

in Julie’s mind, had finally begun 
to melt. 
my name is ted 
Julie’s mind soared. 
ted ted that’s a beautiful name 
The clanging of the bell in- 

truded. There was a shuffling of 
bodies as the students gathered up 
books, papers, pens, and herded 
themselves toward the door. Al- 
most instantly Julie was alone in 
the classroom. 
so class is over 
Ted picked up her thought. 
what now, julie? do you want to 
meet me? 

yes god, yes, yes no more 
loneliness please 
The pause lengthened unendur- 
ably. Then Ted answered and the 
key of his thought was subdued. 
no julie i hope not 
where will i meet you 
across the mall on the north side 
i’ll be sitting on the steps of the 
liberal arts building you don’t 
mind if i wait here and let you do

meet you where it’s beautiful and 
it’s just that way here 

i don’t mind it’s a wonderful 
morning to walk now 


IN THE SILENT WORLD

The next class was starting to 
filter into the room as Julie folded 
her notebook and put the ballpoint 
pen into her purse. Several stu- 
dents were already seajted and a 
very tall boy with red hair was 
standing at the end of Julie’s row, 
looking uneasy. He probably sat 
in the desk Julie now occupied and 
wasn’t sure how to cope with this 
unexpected change in his daily 
routine. 

Cradling her books in the crook 
of one arm, Julie stood and smiled 
at the redhead. He smiled back 
self-consciously and lowered his 
eyes. Julie suddenly caught his 
thought. 

what a cute girl wish she was 
in my class 

Julie smiled at him again as she 
passed and walked toward the 
door. Classes had almost finished 
changing. Julie threaded her way 
through late students and the 
others who were leisurely enjoying 
the spring sun as they wandered 
back to their dormitories. 
julie where are you from 
Ted.

H EY, JULIE. Wait up, hon- 
ey — ” 

She stopped and turned. Mar- 
tin, tall and bluff in striped sports 
shirt and immaculate white tennis 
shoes, smiled down. 

“Come on,” he said. Julie obe- 
diently started walking again and 
he fell into step beside her. “I want 
to talk to you.” 

“Yes?” 

He looked down at her. 

“I want to apologize for the 
other night. That was a pretty bad 
scene.” 

“Yes, it was.” She didn’t want 
to talk to Martin but she had been 
taught to be civil. 
ted do you mind 
no 

“I’m not really that way at all. I 
guess I had a lot to drink — too 
much. I was a little higher than I 
expected to be.” 

Julie nodded. 

“Well, I guess I wasn’t really 
myself.” 

Julie looked silently down at the 
sidewalk. 

“What I mean is,” said Martin, 
“I want to apologize. I mean I 
want to make it up to you. Do you 
want to go out to a show and may- 
be have a few drinks this Saturday 
night?” The words rushed out. “It 
won’t be like last time at all.” 

Julie looked into Martin’s earn- 


80 


IF 



est face and deliberately skimmed 
the surface of his conscious 
thoughts. 

it better not be like last time 
this time the bitch better put out or 
else i'm not about to spend % 
good cash on tickets and booze 
just so we can play kissy-jace at 
the front door of her dorm 
Julie forced her lips to smile. 
Martin smiled back gently, affec- 
tionately. 

“Go to hell,” said Julie. 

She reached up, slapped Martin 
with all the force of her body. She 
walked away and left him standing 
dumb and foolish. 

Compassion and gentle laughter 
were in Ted’s thoughts. 

good show girl but you 
should have kneed him right where 
it hurts he deserved more 
why he’s no worse than oth- 

ers kind words in their mouths 
while their minds scream hate 
it isn’t always so bad people 
have good thoughts now and then 
sometimes they think honest 
things occasionally they forget 

about selfishness and lying 
. like you 

His thought came buoyed by a 
vast good humor. 


i’m no candidate for sainthood 
but i guess i just try to treat people 
like i’d like to be treated it’s a 
hokey philosophy but not a bad 
wish why not wish when 
i’m wishing i’m not at peace with 
myself 

His thought echoed in Julie like 
a litany. She recognized it and was 
still savoring it when the next one 
came. 

i’ve never really been at peace 
otherwise with myself or any- 
body i used to hate all of them 
for being what they were for 
not being able to touch me 
and i hated myself for hating 
and now 
i don’t know 

Something fluttered against 
Julie’s face. She opened her eyes 
and saw it — a yellow butterfly, 
bright-winged and fragile. 

ted i feel like i’ve always been 
blind and now i can see 

Julie stopped on the sidewalk, 
turned completely around and 
eagerly took into herself the lush 
green lawns, the beds of crimson 
flowers, the tan stone and ivy-cov- 
ered college walls and behind them 
in the air, the white skyline of 
downtown Atlanta. 





it's all different now ted not 
like it was 

She pirouetted, ecstatically 
thirsty, and drank the sights and 
sounds and smells and touches she 
had dimly known existed outside 
her. 

Ted’s thought came softly. 
beautiful 

Julie saw the beauty of the world 
and felt the vision melt with Ted’s 
mind in a thousand subtle ways. 
She took this taste of him, magni- 
fied it and she imagined she was a 
vessel overflowing with Ted’s love 
for life, his sensitivity, his kindness. 

easy girl careful i don’t 
think you’ve ever really looked at 
the world you re getting drunk 
on reality 

Julie laughed and was silent. 
you’re beautiful 

i keep telling you i'm just a sim- 
ple type with an oversimplified 
way of life that keeps me relatively 
happy 

then i want it too 
it’s easy sometimes all you 
have to do is open yourself up to 
the world that’s all 

She sensed a sharpness but dis- 
regarded it. 
i think i love you 
slow down julie we haven’t 
even met

tant way do you suppose our 

children will inherit our esp talent 
i really hadn’t thought that far 
ahead

loneliness start to melt 
julie

i’m almost there 

The mall was a broad green 
meadow, pentagonal, a web of 
paths linking the buildings at its 
corners. Julie crossed the center. 
Ahead was the pseudo-Greek ar- 
chitecture of the Liberal Arts 
Building where Ted waited. 

Julie reached the steps and 
stopped. She looked around. 
Classes had long since begun again 
and few students were in sight. A 
slender Negro sat to her left, be- 
side a stack of worn textbooks. Ju- 
lie turned ahead and saw a man 
seated a few steps above her, an 
athletic type staring back at her 
through dark glasses. 

“Ted?” she said tentatively. 

ted 

julie over here 
“Julie.” 

The voice came from her left. 
Julie turned. 

“Hello, Julie.” 

His voice was low, a pleasant 
bass. For an incredibly dilated mo- 
ment Julie stared at the full lips 
from which the words had come, 
the wide dark eyes, the black skin. 
He spread his hands slightly.

T HE continent below him was 

covered with lush jungle except 

for the sandy plateau twenty miles 

in diameter. A moment earlier his 

* 

instruments had picked up the oth- 
er ship sitting near the southern 
edge of the tableland. The sandy 
surface of the plateau was fairly 
regular and Rysling decided to 
bring his own craft down on auto- 
matic, as close to the other ship as 
possible. He sat back in his contour 
seat and waited, his senses alert. 
Was someone else trying to beat 
him to his job? 

His small exploratory vessel was 
now three thousand feet above the 
plateau and coming down fast on 
secondary jets. The primary land- 
side jets cut in with a roar at five 
hundred feet and the sleek vessel 
settled slowly to the sand. When 
all had quieted the displaced sand 
made a crater-like perimeter 
around the silver hull. 

Rysling made sure the double 
safety on tne star-drive was secure, 
cut in the double safety for the 
landside rockets. Through his for- 
ward screen he saw that the other 
ship and also both suns were up. 
The yellow star was high in the 
dark blue sky, near its noontime. 
The red giant was near the hori- 
zon, just above the green jungle 
which surrounded the barren pla- 
teau. Rysling released the strap 
from around his waist. He stood 
up slowly and stretched. Nothing 
about the other ship was moving. 
As yet the planet had no name, 


only a number: 3-10004-2. The 
gravity was only slightly higher 
than Earth normal. The atmos- 
phere was nearly identical in com- 
position to Earth’s. For all prac- 
tical purposes the planet was ready 
to be colonized. But Earth Author- 
ity was picky. It wanted a com- 
plete classification of the land ani- 
mals. That was why hfc was here, to 
catch the only remaining land ani- 
mal that had not yet been caught, a 
catlike, four-footed creature which 
to date had eluded all efforts of 
hunters. That was all he had been 
told. He had been given a flat fee, 
operating expenses and a time lim- 
it of one earth month. Two weeks 
had already gone by. 

As he came down the exit ramp, 
Rysling took a deep breath of the 
warm, humid air. After two weeks 
of the clean, sterile ship’s air the 
natural variety smelled awful. He 
was almost sickened by the 
thought of micro-organisms sus- 
pended all around him. He came 
to the end of the ramp and the sand 
was gritty beneath his heavy boots. 
It felt good, despite the air. He no- 
ticed that he was about four hun- 
dred feet from the other ship. 

H E WALKED to the other 
craft. The yellow sun was 
warm on his face. The other ship 
was also an exploratory model, 
slightly larger than his own. He 
estimated that it was perhaps two 
years older. There was a large, 


84 


IF 



slightly scarred H on the hull. It 
might be one of Henderson’s ships, 
he thought, but the fading letter 
was not conclusive proof. 

The ramp was down. Rsyling 
went halfway up the incline. 

“Is anyone home?” His voice 
echoed in the open airlock. There 
was no answer. He walked into the 
airlock and shouted up the central 
passageway which led up into the 
control room. “Hello.” Still no 
answer. 

Rsyling climbed the ladder into 
the control room. He looked 
around at everything carefully. All 
seemed to be in order — shut down 
— except for the radar and sensor 
instruments. They continued their 
watch of the surrounding country. 
For the moment they had nothing 
to report. The light above the se- 
curity switches over the star-drive 
and rockets glowed a bright green. 
Everything seemed as it should be. 

They’re all probably outside. 
I'm sure to run into them sooner 
or later. 

He was almost ready to leave 
when his curiosity got the better of 
him. He sat down in the captain’s 
station and flicked on the log tape. 
He listened. For a long time there 
was nothing. At last, very faintly, 
he heard heavy breathing, then a 
voice he didn’t recognize. 

“The greycat, came into my 
mind. Suddenly I wasn’t a man 
any more but a beast. A hallucina- 
tion? I don’t know — but I’ll be 
ready for it the next time. Going 


out now. Time: hell, my watch is 
broken . .” 

The tape ran on for a long time. 
Nothing more seemed to be on it. 
Rysling waited a little longer and 
switched it off. Apparently the 
skipper of the ship had not yet 
come back. He sounded like a man 
of imagination and easily fright- 
ened. Rysling shrugged. 

He descended to the airlock, 
walked down the ramp, wandered 
to the edge of the plateau. Maybe 
the ship’s personnel was down in 
the jungle. He unsnapped his bi- 
noculars and began sweeping the 
jungle. Some impulse made him 
look straight down to the base of 
the cliff. He saw a stretch of white 
sand — and then he saw the bones. 

Two human skeletons lay on the 
sand, hands pointed to the jungle 
as if praying. They must have fall- 
en to their deaths somehow. 

Rysling turned up the magnifi- 
cation of his oculars. At once it 
seemed he was standing directly 
over the two skeletons. 'A bug 
crawled out of one of the skulls 
and fled across the bright sand in- 
to the underbrush. How long did it 
take for flesh to rot away? Later 
he would have to go down and try 
to make identifications, determine 
what had happened and pack the 
remains for shipment home. 

But for now he had a job to do, 
an animal to net. It was the kind 
of odd job he often took on be- 
tween his regular ship runs. A man 
could always do with a little extra 


TRAPS

capital. Besides, he liked hunting. 
Trap a greycat, they had told him. 
Simple enough with the proper 
gear. But others had failed. Maybe 
Earth Authority had hired bun- 
glers. Like the previous owners of 
the two skeletons below? 

Their fate really didn’t concern 
him. He would not fail. 


T HE “hound” was really just a 
cage which could open any one 
of its six sides, could track its prey 
visually and through body heat 
and strike more swiftly than any 
living thing could move. Carefully 
Rysling worked the remote con- 
trols and guided it out of the cargo 
hold and gently down to the sand. 
He had set up the tripod earlier. It 
held the screen monitor for the 
hound’s electronic eyes. The re- 
mote control panel was just below 
the screen. In effect he would be 
the hound, seeing with its eyes and 
making sure that it did not tangle 
itself in vegetation — much of the 
tracking, however, was automatic 
and in reality he would only be 
needed during crucial moments, if 
they arose. Otherwise he could just 
sit in front of the monitor and live 
vicariously what the hound was 
doing. A routine job. He could not 
see how anyone could have failed 
to catch the animal. The beast 
didn’t have a chance. The hound’s 
eyes and heat-sensing device were 
tied into the ship’s computers 
which had been programed to rec- 


ognize only this* type of living 
thing. 

Rysling adjusted the controls 
for automatic search pattern. The 
pattern was based on what knowl- 
edge the computer had of the grey- 
cat. The hound lifted itself from 
the sand and moved slowly to the 
edge of the plateau. In a moment 
it dripped out of sight into the jun- 
gle. Rysling sat back in his seat in 
front of the monitor screen and 
stretched his legs. 

In front of him now he could see 
wide-stemmed plants as the 
hound-cage pushed them aside. 
Some smaller plants bore large un- 
opened buds. The tree trunks were 
massive, and an unfamiliar moss 
grew over much of their brown sur- 
face. The grass in the forest was a 
foot high, Rysling estimated. He 
could see great vines\ passing 
throught it — lines of communica- 
tion between the trees. He felt as 
if he were the hound, a great and 
powerful beast moving through the 
jungle aisles. The heat there was 
oppressive and moisture fell in 
great drops from huge leaves. He 
pushed a button and the hound’s 
eyes looked to the now hidden sky. 
He could only see the great trunks, 
standing like titans, guardians of 
the forest. 

Rysling turned to look at the 
other ship. Sunlight was bright on 
the plateau. The yellow star was 
edging toward its afternoon. The 
red giant was partly below the hor- 
izon. Atmospheric refraction dis- 


86 


IF 



torted its equatorial region, mak- 
ing the huge star look misshapen 
and bloated. Rysling no longer be- 
lieved that anyone would return to 
the other ship. 

When he turned again to the 
screen the hound was motionless. 
Nothing moved on the monitor ex- 
cept for a leaf touched by the wind. 
Slowly, silently, the greycat 
walked into view, thin and muscu- 
lar, body low to the ground — the 
eyes were yellow ovals and looked 
directly into the screen. Rysling 
was fascinated by the eyes, they 
beckoned him, they drew his gaze 
into themselves. It seemed almost 
as if the cat were looking directly 
at him, as if the green-furred beast 
knew that something else waited 
behind the hound's mechanical 
eyes. Rysling bit his lip. His hands 
hovered over the console, ready to 
take over in case of difficulty. 

The hound moved in slowly at 
first, automatically — it picked up 
speed until it was moving about 
thirty miles an hour. But the grey- 
cat was suddenly a blur skimming 
the grass. The hound followed with 
deadly accuracy, changing direc- 
tion with the animal. In a few mo- 
ments it was directly behind the 
cat. Both were moving well past 
fifty miles and hour, Rysling esti- 
mated. The front cage door was 
open. Rysling noticed the red light 
on the console, informing him of 
the fact. There was a different col- 
ored light for each of the six doors. 
At any moment now the cat would 


be scooped up and the door would 
shut. In front of him Rysling could 
see the dark streak that ran from 
the cat’s ears to the long tail. 

The greycat jumped into some 
brush, turned and snarled at him. 
In a moment it would all be over, 
Rysling thought. Then he could go 
and take care of the two skeletons 
at the cliff base, go home to collect 
the rest of his fee. 

The green vegetation before him 
was suddenly very vivid. Rysling 
felt a dizziness. He closed his eyes 
for a moment. His arms grew 
heavy and blood pounded in his 
head. When he opened his eyes the 
screen was out of focus and the 
whole world was spinning. 

He felt as if he were falling , but 
slowly. And the cool green grass 
of the forest was all around him , 
caressing him , inviting him to sleep 
until his strength returned and he 
could fight the strange , scentless 
creature that was chasing him. 
Rysling looked up at the hound 
through the greycat* s eyes. It was 
coming toward him. He rose on 
his hind paws and fell back farther 
into the thick brush. He tried to 
swat the cage with his paw. He 
snarled and fell over backward. He 
jumped to all fours immediately. 

And ran. His cat’s body ran 
without him , instinctively , turning , 
jumping with an exhilarating sure- 
ness. He felt the thorn balls cling 
to his paws. His eyes saw every- 
thing — the forest was a rich or- 


TRAPS

chestration of scents that told him 
all he needed to know. 


W ITH a trembling hand 
Rysling turned off the 
hound’s automatic program. He 
was shaking. Sweat had run down 
his back. He inhaled a tranquilizer. 
The hound would come back now 
but he would send it out again. 

A hallucination, he thought. It 
was what the voice on the log tape 
of the other ship had been talking 
about. But he had felt pain, fatigue, 
tasted the pungent scents of the 
forest, known the sweat and mus- 
cles of the swift greycat as he knew 
his own. And he had known the 
fear of the cat, running before 
something it did not understand, 
could never understand because it 
was not part of the normal envi- 
ronment. 

He thought he had part of the 
picture now. He had been hit by 
the animal’s defense mechanism. 
Did the cat have telepathic abili- 
ties? At any rate, what he had ex- 
perienced had to be an illusion and 
he would have to ignore it next 
time around. Perhaps the cat’s 
strange power dated from some 
still undiscovered stage of inter- 
planetary evolution when all life 
forms were still undifferentiated, 
all awarenesses one — the single 
pulse of the natural force. 

The hound appeared over the 
edge of the plateau. It skimmed to 
within six feet of the control con- 


sole tripod and settled to the 
ground. Rysling went to it and 
checked it carefully. Nothing was 
wrong. He went back to the con- 
sole and sat down to face the 
screen. With one flick he turned 
the automatic track back on. 
Quickly the hound flew over it. 
When it reached the spot where it 
had left the cat it descended again 
to the jungle floor, its heat residue 
sensor scanning the ground for 
the warm trail. The greycat’s path 
led in a wide circle toward the 
northern cliff wall of the plateau. 
The hound followed. 

Apparently the animal was fol- 
lowing the cliff wall closely. The 
hound picked up speed. The grey- 
cat came into view on the sand 
ahead. The hound picked up still 
more speed. The cat ran, leaving 
big paw prints in the sand strip that 
rimmed the base of the plateau. 

Rysling braced himself for the 
hallucination. It came like a dream 
he could recognize as one but he 
could not break the spell. The cage 
was open and coming directly for 
him. The cliff wall was at his back. 
He had to wait for the moment 
when he could rush past it into the 
jungle. For an instant his new 
body was frozen, as if all its in- 
stincts were dead or confused by 
the precision of an enemy which 
made so few mistakes, gave so 
little opportunity to escape. The 
cage came on until it was directly 
in front of him. 

It swallowed him. The bars slid 


88 


IF 



shut with a click. Then he heard 
the small voice whispering in his 
ear, Youre Rysling — this is an il- 
lusion. It will go away, change. 
Just wait. But the presence of the 
jungle was stronger, the backdrop 
of his new life, the vast and vivid 
support for his senses, the source 
of all blessings. He heard it, he 
smelled it, he saw the vivid, aching- 
ly intense colors. Only the bars 
kept him from it. His own voice 
was very faint, very far away and of 
no consequence. A small fly buzz- 
ing near his ear. 

The greycat threw himself at the 
bars. Stupid, the button, the voice 
said. Outside the first bar . He slid 
his paw between the bars and 
pushed wildly. The side entrance 
of the cage opened with a half-re- 
membered whirring sound. 

The jungle beckoned. He ran in- 
to the gloom, quietly, swiftly, in 
one fluid motion unlike the jerky 
point-to-point movement of his 
previous life. He could smell the 
shades of colors — he sensed the 
range which before had been only 
green, brown, or mud-colored. 
The soft voice told him to go back, 
regain his former self, break the 


spell that bound him to a world 
that man had turned his back on a 
million years ago— but the voice 
was a poor, sterile thing compared 
with the rich, surrounding forest. 

Still, he would have to go back, 
if only for a moment. The jungle 
called to him — it promised confi- 
dently. 

But instead he ran toward the 
sandy plateau. 

The human form that had once 
been Kurt Rysling stood up from 
its seat in front of the tripod con- 
sole. Its movements were jerky. It 
tried to walk and fell on all fours. 
The smell of the jungle it had 
known all its life seemed distant , 
faded and alien. The colors were 
pale and the normal sounds of the 
forest were gone. Its strange new 
limbs were weak. The greycat tried 
to growl but only a weak sound 
came out of its small, human 
mouth. He crawled nearer the 
jungle, hoping that all the normal 
sensations would return. He 
reached the edge. The urge to jump 
came suddenly. The greycat leaped 
from the plateau, its human arms 
stretched out in front like paws. 

The small voice still spoke in 



89 







the greycat’s simple brain. Mo- 
mentarily it became stronger when 
the cat came to the broken body of 
Kurt Rysling lying next to the sun- 
bleached skeletons at the bottom 
of the cliff. The red star had long 
since set, and the yellow sun was 
low over the jungle. The cat stood 
perfectly still in the cliff’s shadow, 
listening. Dimly, from somewhere 
in the depths of the greycat’s ner- 
vous system, Rysling understood 
what had happened to the two skel- 
etons before him. This then was 
the skipper of the other ship and 
his companion and what was hap- 
pening to him had happened to 
them. He looked at his own corpse 
with indifference. It was after all a 
thing and not himself. He felt com- 
fortable and safe. From some- 
where his old voice summoned up 
enough strength to tell him that 
while he could adapt easily to the 
cat’s nervous system, the greycat 
had not been able to master the 
complexities of a human cortex. 
But, then, did this not mean that 
the human mind was only a resi- 
dent of the physio-chemical brain? 
That in reality it was an epiphe- 
nomenon, a matrix of energy 
which could detach itself from its 
physical form? It must be so, the 
small voice said. After all, the iron 
of a magnet produces something 
beyond itself, the magnetic field; 
and the mass of a world produces 
a gravitational field; and the 
physio-chemical brain tissue pro- 
duces a pattern of energies that is 


the real mind, responsible for all 
the higher functions. The small 
voice seemed desperate as it spoke. 
There would be a price to pay for 
his new existence — fading mem- 
ories, the power of reason, love. 
But he didn’t care. The world was 
vast and entirely within his grasp. 
It was a world for him. The smells 
of the forest wrapped themselves 
around him. Did he for a moment 
detect — a female odor? The image 
was clear: a sleek female, waiting 
somewhere for him. The small 
voice was almost gone now — he 
could not understand its meaning 
or where it had come from. He 
glanced again at the broken body 
that lay face down, its neck bro- 
ken. He looked up to the edge of 
the plateau. Had he thought of 
going there? There was no way up. 
Swiftly he turned and ran into the 
green shadows. His muscles were 
strong. In one place the yellow 
sun cast its light into the jungle 
aisle, making his fur feel warm. 
Soon, he knew, it would be night. 
The small voice was only a back- 
ground sound,' no stronger than 
an insect’s drone. He stopped and 
turned to look at the plateau, 
which from this distance was vis- 
ible through a break in the trees. 
He could just barely see the top of 
one silvery ship. He looked at it, 
trying to remember what it was 
but that memory was already 
gone. 

The greycat turned again and 
disappeared into the jungle. •

WHIPPING 

PART III STAR 

\

WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 


Jorj X. McKie, Saboteur Extra- 
ordinary of the Bureau of Sabo- 
tage of the Confederated Sentients, 
is called to the planet of Cordiality 
on an urgent mission — a Caleban 
Beachball has been sighted on the 
planet. 

McKie arrives on Cordiality via 
a jumpdoor — an instantaneous 
space-travel medium controlled by 
the mysterious Calebans — and is 
briefed on the emergency by fellow 
BuSab agent, Alicheno Furuneo. 
Calebans, sentient members of the 
Con-Sentients, have lately been 
disappearing, with disastrous ef- 
fects on humans and other sen- 
tients around them. It is thought 
that Mlis Abnethe, an enormously 
wealthy and beautiful but unscrup- 
ulous human woman is somehow 
involved in the disappearances. 

No one has ever seen a Caleban 
and few have successfully commu- 
nicated with one. McKie forces an 
entry into the Beachball stranded 
on Cordiality and confronts the 
Caleban domiciled in it. He suc- 
ceeds in establishing communica- 
tion with the Caleban, a pure sen- 
tient, who communicates from 
mind to mind and tells him that 
Mlis Abnethe is indeed involved in 
the inexplicable goings on. Mlis is 
a flagellator , who has acquired a 
contractual right to have the Cale- 
ban whipped for her pleasure — in 
return she has promised certain 
educational advantages for Cale- 
bans. McKie witnesses and inter- 
rupts one of the flagellations, dis- 
covers that the Caleban, who has 


assumed the name Fanny Mae, has 
fallen in love with him. 

McKie, a veteran of fifty-four 
unsuccessful marriages, is unim- 
pressed, but utilizes the fact that 
the universality of love permits 
Fanny Mae to violate her contract 
with Mliss Abnethe and send him 
on her trail via a jumpdoor. 

He emerges on an unfamiliar 
planet, talking to an uncommuni- 
cative rock. 

He starts walking, receives an 
interplanetary telepathic call — ac- 
tually a sniggertrance seizure — 
from his superiors at BuSab. One 
of Abnethe s whips and knives have 
been recovered and analyzed as 
being made of rawhide and steel. 
Both materials are anachronistic 
to the time of the events — their use 
has been discontinued long ago, 
and may provide a clue to Ab- 
nethe s whereabouts — McKie is to 
look into the matter. 

He does — and finds himself in 
a strangely archaic setting, sugges- 
tive of a textbook scene from the 
dark ages of ancient Earth. 

He sees black men, women and 
children, grass huts, primitive, two- 
horned beasts yoked to wagons — a 
scene from ancient Africa. 

The blacks turn out to be Mliss 
Abnethe's subjects — he has 

reached her hideaway without 
knowing where he is in time and 
space. While Abnethe reaches out 
via a jumpdoor to murder Furun- 
eo, who has been left to guard 
Fanny Mae, the blacks seize Mc- 
Kie and prepare to kill him. 

With her Pan Spechi aide, Cheo, 
Abnethe plots the death of Fanny 
Mae and the end of ConSentients.

IF 



VII 

A S FURUNEO’S life monitor 
ignited at his death, Taprisi- 
ots scanned the Beachball area. 
They found only the Caleban and 
four enforcers in hovering guard 
ships. Reasoning about actions, 
motives or guilt did not come with- 
in the Taprisiot scope. They merely 
reported the death, its location and 
the sentients available to their 
scanners. 

The four enforcers came in for 
several days of rough questioning 
as a result. The Caleban was a dif- 
ferent matter. A full BuSab man- 
agement conference was required 
before they could decide what ac- 
tion to take about the Caleban. 
Furuneo’s death had come under 
extremely mysterious circum- 
stances — no head, unintelligible 
responses from the Caleban. 

As Tuluk entered the conference 
room on a summons that had 
roused him from sleep, Siker was 
flailing the table. He was using his 
middle fighting tendril for the ges- 
ture, quite unLaclac in emotional 
intensity. 

“We don’t act without calling 
McKie,” Siker said. “This is too 
delicate.” 

Tuluk took his position at the 
table, leaned into the Wreave sup- 
port provided for his species, spoke 
mildly: “Haven’t you contacted 
McKie yet? Furuneo was supposed 
to have ordered the Caleban — ” 
That was as far as he got. Ex- 
planations and data came at him 
from several of the others. 

Presently, Tuluk said: “Where’s 
Furuneo’s body?’’ 


“Enforcers are bringing it to the 
lab now.’’ 

“Have the police been brought 
in?” 

“Of course.” 

“Anything on the missing 
head?” 

“No sign of it.” 

“Has to be result of a jump- 
door,” Tuluk said. “Will the po- 
lice take over?” 

“We’re not going to allow that. 
One of our own.” 

Tuluk nodded. “Fm with Siker, 
then. We don’t move without con- 
sulting McKie. This case was 
handed to him when we didn’t 
know its extent. He’s still in 
charge.” 

“Should we reconsider that de- 
cision?” someone down the table 
asked. 

Tuluk shook his head. “Bad 
form,” he said. “First things first. 
Furuneo’ s dead and he was sup- 
posed to have ordered McKie’s re- 
turn some time ago.” 

Bildoon, the Pan Spechi chief 
of the Bureau, had watched this 
exchange with attentive silence. He 
had been ego holder of his pen- 
tarchal life group for seventeen 
years — a reasonably average time 
in his species. Although the 
thought revolted him in a way oth- 
er species could never really un- 
derstand, he knew he would have 
to give up the ego to the youngest 
member of his creche circle soon. 
The ego exchange would come 
sooner than it might have without 
the strains of command. Terrible 
price to pay in the service of sen- 
tience, he thought. 

The humanoid appearance his 


WHIPPING STAR 


95 



kind had genetically adopted had 
a tendency to beguile other hu- 
manoids into forgetting the es- 
sentially alien character of the Pan 
Spechi. The time would come, 
though, when they would be unable 
to avoid alien awareness in Bil- 
doon’s case. His friends in the Con- 
Sentiency would see the creche- 
change at its beginning — the glaz- 
ing of the eyes, the rictus of mouth. 

Best not think about that, he 
warned himself. He needed all his 
abilities right now. 

He felt he no longer lived in 
his ego-self, and this was a sensa- 
tion of exquisite torture for a Pan 
Spechi. But the black negation of 
all sentient life that threatened his 
universe demanded the sacrifice of 
personal fears. The Caleban must 
not be allowed to die. Until he had 
assured himself of the Caleban’s 
survival, he must cling to any rope 
life offered him, endure any ter- 
ror, refuse to mourn for the al- 
most-death-of-self that lurked in 
Pan Spechi nightmares. A greater 
death pressed upon them all. 

Siker, he saw, was staring at 
him with an unspoken question. 

Bildoon spoke three words: “Get 
a Taprisiot.” 

Someone near the door hurried 
to obey. 

“Who was most recently in con- 
tact with McKie?” Bildoon asked. 

“I believe I was,” Tuluk said. 

“It’ll be easier for you, then,” 
Bildoon said. “Make it short.” 

Tuluk wrinkled his facial slit in 
agreement. 

A Taprisiot was led in, was 
helped up onto the table. It com- 
plained that they were being much 


too rough with its speech needles, 
that the imbedment was imperfect, 
that they had not given it sufficient 
time to prepare its energies. 

O NLY after Bildoon invoked 
the emergency clause of the 
Bureau’s special contract would it 
agree to act. It positioned itself in 
front of Tuluk 

It said, “Date, time and place.” 
Tuluk gave the local coordinates. 
“Close face,” the Taprisiot or- 
dered. 

Tuluk obeyed. 

“Think of contact,” the Tapri- 
siot sqeaked. 

Tuluk thought of McKie. 

Time passed without contact. 
Tuluk opened his face, stared out. 

“Close face,” the Taprisiot or- 
dered. 

Tuluk obeyed. 

Bildoon asked, “Is something 
wrong?” 

“Contact through Caleban 
change time,” the Taprisiot said. 
“Same as before.” 

“Contact through a Caleban?” 
Bildoon ventured. 

“Otherwise not available,” the 
Taprisiot said. “McKie isolated in 
connectives of another being.” 

“I don’t care how you get him, 
just get him,” Bildoon ordered. 

“Hold silence,” the Taprisiot 
said. “Disturb imbedment.” Its 
speech needles rustled. “Pucha, 
pucha,” it said. “Call go when 
Caleban permit.” 

Abruptly, Tuluk jerked as the 
sniggertrance marked pineal igni- 
tion. 

“McKie?” he said. “Tuluk 
here.” 


96 


IF 



The words, uttered through the 
mumbling of the sniggertrance, 
were barely audible to the others 
around the table. 

Speaking as calmly as he could, 
McKie said, “McKie will not be 
here in about thirty seconds unless 
you call Furuneo and have him or- 
der that Caleban to free me — ” 

“What’s wrong?” Tuluk asked. 

“I’m staked out and a Palenki 
is on its way to kill me. I can see 
it against the firelight. It’s carrying 
what appears to be an axe. It’s 
going to chop me up. You know 
how they — ” 

“I can’t call Furuneo. He’s . .” 

“Then call the Caleban!” 

“You know you can’t call a Cal- 
eban.” 

“Doit, you oaf!” 

Because McKie had ordered it, 
suspecting that he might know 
such a call could be made, Tuluk 
broke the contact, sent a demand 
at the Taprisiot. It was against 
reason — all the data said Taprisi- 
ots could not link sentients and 
Calebans. 

To the observers in the confer- 
ence room the more obvious mum- 
bling and chuckling of the snigger- 
trance faded, made a brief return, 
disappeared. Bildoon almost 
barked a question at Tuluk, hes- 
itated. The Wreave’s tubular body 
remained so — still. 

“I wonder why the Tappy said 
he had to call through a Caleban?” 
Siker whispered. 

Bildoon shook his head. 

A Chither near Tuluk said, 
“You know, I could swear he or- 
dered the Taprisiot to call the 
Caleban.” 


“Nonsense,” Siker said. 

“I don’t understand it,” the Chi- 
ther said. “How could McKie go 
somewhere and not know where he 

is?” 

“Is Tuluk out of the snigger- 
trance or isn’t he?” Siker asked, 
his voice fearful. “He acts like no- 
body’s there.” 

Every sentient around the table 
froze into silence. They all knew 
what Siker meant. Had the 
Wreave been trapped in the call? 
Was Tuluk gone, taken into that 
strange limbo from which the per- 
sonality never returned? 

“NOW!” someone roared. 

The assembled sentients jerked 
back from the conference table as 
McKie came tumbling out of no- 
where in a shower of dust and dirt. 
He landed flat on his back on the 
table directly in front of Bildoon, 
who lifted half out of his chair. 

McKie’s wrists were bloody. His 
eyes were glazed. His red hair was 
a tangled, wild mop. 

“Now,” McKie whispered. He 
turned to his side, saw Bildoon, 
and as though it explained every- 
thing, added: “The axe was de- 
scending.” 

“What axe?” Bildoon demand- 
ed, sliding back into his chair. 

“The one the Palenki was aim- 
ing at my head.” 

“The— what?” 

McKie sat up, massaged his 
torn wrists where the bindings had 
held him. Presently he shifted his 
ministrations to his ankles. He 
looked like a Gowachin frog deity. 

“McKie, explain what’s going 
on here,” Bildoon ordered. 

“I — ahhh — well, the nick of 


WHIPPING STAR 


97 



time was almost a fatal nick too 
late,” McKie said. “What made 
Furuneo wait so long? He was told 
six hours, no more. Wasn’t he?” 

McKie looked at Tuluk, who re- 
mained silent, stiff as a length of 
gray pipe against the Wreave sup- 
port. 

“Furuneo’sdead,” Bildoon said. 

“Damn,” McKie said softly. 
“How?” 

Bildoon made the explanation 
brief, then asked, “Where’ve you 
been? What’s this about a Palenki 
with an axe?” 

McKie, still sitting on the table, 
gave a neatly abbreviated, chrono- 
logical report. It sounded as 
though he were . talking about a 
third person. 

He wound it up with a flat state- 
ment: “I have no idea at all where 
I was.” 

“They were going to — chop you 
up?” Bildoon asked. 

“The axe was coming down,” 
McKie said. “It was right there.” 
He held up a hand about six centi- 
meters from his nose.” 

Siker cleared his throat, said, 
“Something’s wrong with Tuluk.” 

They all turned. 

T ULUK remained propped 
against the support, his face 
slit closed. His body was there but 
he was not. 

“Is he — lost?” Bildoon rasped 
and turned away. 

If Tuluk failed to come back — 
how like the Pan Spechi ego loss 
that would be! 

“Somebody down there shake 
up that Taprisiot,” McKie ordered. 
“Why bother?” That was a hu- 


man male from the legal depart- 
ment. “They never answer a direct 
question about — you know.” He 
glanced uneasily at Bildoon, who 
remained with face averted. 

“Tuluk made contact with the 
Caleban,” McKie said, remember- 
ing. “I told him — it’s the only way 
he could have done it with Furuneo 
dead.” 

He stood up on the table, walked 
down its length to stand towering 
over the Taprisiot. 

“You!” he shouted. “Tapri- 
siot!” 

Silence. 

McKie drew a finger along an 
arm of speech needles. They clat- 
tered like a line of wooden clackers 
but no intelligible sound came 
from the Taprisiot. 

“You’re not supposed to touch 
them,” someone said. 

“Get another Taprisiot in here,” 
McKie ordered. 

Someone ran to obey. 

.McKie mopped his forehead. 
He required all his reserves to keep 
from trembling. During the de- 
scent of the Palenki axe he had 
said goodbye to the universe. It 
had been final, irrevocable. He still 
felt that he had not returned, that 
he was watching the antics of some 
other creature in his own flesh, a 
familiar creature — but a stranger, 
really. This room, the words and 
actions around him, were some 
sort of distorted play refined to 
blind sterility. In the instant when 
he had accepted his own death 
he had realized there still remained 
uncounted experiences he wanted 
to live through. This room and his 
duties as a BuSab agent had not 


98 


IF 



been among those experiences. 
The old reality was drowned in 
selfish memories. Still, this flesh 
went through the motions. That 
was what training did. 

A second Taprisiot was herded 
into the room, its needles squeak- 
ing complaints. It was hoisted on- 
to the table, objecting all the way. 

“You have Taprisiot! Why you 
disturb?” 

Bildoon turned back to the table, 
studied the scene but remained si- 
lent, withdrawn. No one had ever 
been brought back from the long- 
distance trap. 

McKie faced the new Taprisiot. 
“Can you contact this other Tap- 
risiot?” he demanded. 

“Pucha, pucha — ” the second 
Taprisiot began. 

“I’m sincere.” 

“Ahseeda day-day,” the second 
Taprisiot squeaked. 

“I’ll stack you with somebody’s 
firewood if you don’t get cracking,” 
McKie snarled. “Can you make 
contact?” 

“Who you call?” the second Ta- 
prisiot asked. 

“Not me, you fugitive from a 
sawmill!” McKie roared. “Them.” 
He pointed at Tuluk and the first 
Taprisiot. 

“They stuck to Caleban,” the 
second Taprisiot said. “Who you 
call?” 

“What do you mean, stuck?” 
McKie demanded. 

“Tangled?” the Taprisiot ven- 
tured. 

“Can either of them be called?” 
McKie asked. 

“Untangle soon, then call,” the 
Taprisiot said. 


“Look,” Siker said. 

McKie whirled. 

Tuluk was flexing his facial slit. 
A mandibular extensor came out, 
withdrew. 

McKie held his breath. 

Tuluk’s facial slit opened wide 
and he said, “Fascinating.” 

“Tuluk?” McKie said. 

The slit widened. Wreave eyes 
stared out. 

“Yes?” Then: “Ah, McKie. You 
made it.” 

“You call now?” the second Ta- 
prisiot asked. 

“Get rid of him,” McKie or- 
dered. 

Squeaking protests — “If you not 
call, why disturb?” — the Taprisiot 
was removed from the room. 

“What happened to you, Tu- 
luk?” McKie asked. 

“Difficult to explain,” the 
Wreave said. 

“Try.” 

“Imbedment,” Tuluk said. 
“That has something to do with 
planetary conjunctions, whether 
the points linked by a call are 
aligned with each other across 
open space. There was some prob- 
lem with this call, discontinuous 
through a stellar mass, perhaps. 
And it was contact with a Caleban 
— I don’t appear to have the prop- 
er words.” 

“Do you understand what hap- 
pened to you?” 

“I think so. You know, I hadn’t 
realized where I lived.” 

McKie stared at him, puzzled. 
“What?” 

“Something’s wrong here,” Tu- 
luk said. “Oh, yes — Furuneo.” 

“You said something about 


WHIPPING STAR 


99 



where you lived,” McKie prodded. 

“Space occupancy, yes,” Tuluk 
said. “I live in a place with many — 
ah — synonymous? Yes, synony- 
mous occupants.” 

“What are you talking about?” 
“I was actually in contact with 
the Caleban during my call to 
you,” Tuluk said. “Very odd, Mc- 
Kie. It was as though my call went 
through a pinhole in a black cur- 
tain and the pinhole was the Cale- 
ban.” 

“So you contacted the Cale- 
ban,” McKie prompted. 

“Oh, yes. Indeed I did.” Tu- 
luk’s mandibular extensors moved 
in a pattern indicative of emotion- 
al disturbance. “I saw! That’s it. I 
saw — ah — many frames of parallel 
films. Of course, I didn’t really see 
them. It was the eye.” 

“Eye? Whose eye?” 

“That’s the pinhole,” Tuluk ex- 
plained. “It’s our eye, too, natu- 
rally.” 

“Do you understand any of this, 
McKie?” Bildoon asked. 

“My impression is he’s talking 
like a Caleban,” McKie said. He 
shrugged. “Contaminated, per- 
haps. Entangled?” 

“I suspect,” Bildoon said, “that 
Caleban communication can be 
understood only by the certifiably 
insane.” 

M CKIE wiped perspiration 
from his lip. He felt he could 
almost understand what Tuluk 
Jbad said. Meaning hovered right 
at the edge of awareness. 

“Tuluk,” Bildoon said, “try to 
tell us what happened to you. We 
don’t understand you.” 


“I am trying.” 

“Keep at it,” McKie said. 

“You contacted the Caleban,” 
Bildoon said. “How was that 
done? We’ve been told it’s impos- 
sible.” 

“It was partly because the Cale- 
ban seemed to be handling my call 
to McKie,” Tuluk said. “Then — 
McKie ordered me to call the Cal- 
eban. Perhaps it heard.” 

Tuluk closed his eyes, appeared 
lost in reverie. 

“Go on,” Bildoon said. 

“I — it was — ” Tuluk shook his 
head, opened his eyes, stared 
pleadingly around the room. He 
met curious, probing eyes on all 
sides. “Imagine two spiderwebs,” 
he said. “Natural spiderwebs, 
now, not the kind they spin at our 
command — random products. 
Imagine that they must— contact 
each other — a certain congruity 
between them, an occlusion.” 

“Like a dental occlusion?” Mc- 
Kie asked. 

“Perhaps. At any rate, this nec- 
essary congruity, this shape re- 
quired for contact, presumes upon 
proper connectives.” 

McKie expelled a harsh breath. 
“What the devil are connectives?” 

“I go now?” the first Taprisiot 
interrupted. 

“Damn,” McKie said. “Some- 
body get rid of this thing.” 

The Taprisiot was hustled from 
the room. 

“Tuluk, what are connectives?” 
McKie demanded. 

“Is this important?” Bildoon 
asked. 

“Will you all take my word for 
it and let him answer?” McKie

asked. “It’s important, believe me. 
Tuluk?” 

Tuluk said, “You realize, of 
course, that artificiality can be re- 
fined to the point where it’s virtu- 
ally indistinguishable from origin- 
al reality?’’ 

“What’s that have to do with 
connectives?” 

“It’s precisely at that point 
where the single distinguishing 
characteristic between original 
and artificial is the connective.” 
“Huh?” McKie said. 

“Look at me,” Tuluk said. 

“I am looking at you.” 

“Imagine that you take a food 
vat and produce in it an exact 
fleshly duplicate of my person,” 
Tuluk said. 

“An exact fleshly — ” 

“You could do it, couldn’t 
you?” Tuluk demanded. 

“Of course. But why?” 

“Just imagine it. Don’t ques- 
tion. An exact duplicate down to 
and including the cellular mes- 
sage units. This fleshwould be im- 
bued with all my memories and 
responses. Ask it a question you 
might ask of me and it would an- 
swer as I might answer. Even my 
mates wouldn’t be able to distin- 
guish between us.” 

“So,” McKie said. 

“Would there be any difference 
between us?” Tuluk asked. 

“But you said — ” 

“There would be one difference, 
wouldn’t there?” 

“The time element, the — ” 
“More than that,” Tuluk said. 
“One would know it was a copy. 
Now, that chairdog in which 
Ser Bildoon sits is a different mat- 
ter, not so?” 


“Huh?” 

“It’s an unthinking animal,” 
Tuluk said. 

McKie stared at the chairdog 
Tuluk had indicated. It was a 
product of genetic shaping, gene 
surgery and selection. What possi- 
ble difference could it make that 
the chairdog was an animal — how- 
ever remotely descended? 

“What does the chairdog eat?” 
Tuluk asked. 

“The food tailored for it, what 
else?” McKie turned back to the 
Wreave, studied him. 

“But neither the chairdog nor 
its food are the same as their an- 
cestral flesh,” Tuluk said. “The 
vat food is an endless, serial chain 
of protein. The chairdog is flesh 
which is ecstatic in its work.” 

“Of course. That’s the way it 
was made.” McKie’s eyes went 
wide. He began to see what Tuluk 
was explaining. 

“The differences, these are the 
connectives,” Tuluk said. 

“McKie, do you understand 
this gibberish?” Bildoon de- 
manded. 

McKie’s throat was dry. “The 
Caleban sees only these — refined 
differences?” he asked. 

“And nothing else,” Tuluk said. 

“Then it doesn’t see us as shapes 
or dimensions or — ” 

“Or even as extensions in time 
as we understand time,” Tuluk 
said. “We are, perhaps, nodes on 
a standing wave. Time, for the 
Caleban, isn’t Something squeezed 
out of a tube. It’s more like a line 
which your senses intersect.” 

, McKie breathed deeply. 

“I don’t see where this helps us

one bit,” Bildoon said. “Our ma- 
jor problem is to find Abnethe. Do 
you have any idea, McKie, where 
that Caleban sent you?” 

“I saw the night constellations 
overhead,” McKie said. “Before 
I leave we’ll get a mindcord on 
what I saw and have a computer 
check on the star patterns.” 

“Provided the pattern’s in the 
Master Registry,” Bildoon said. 

“What about that slave culture 
McKie stumbled on?” one of the 
Legal staff asked. “We could ask 
fora . 

“Haven’t any of you been listen- 
ing?” McKie asked. “Our problem 
is to find Abnethe. I thought we 
had her, but I’m beginning to 
think this may not be that easy. 
Where is she? How can we go into 
a court and say ‘At some unknown 
place in an unknown galaxy, a fe- 
male believed to be Mliss Ab- 
nethe, but whom I didn’t really 
see, is alleged to be conduct- 
mg . 

“Then what do we do?” the Le- 
gal staffer growled. 

“With Furuneo dead, who’s 
watching Fanny Mae?” McKie 
asked. 

“We have four enforcers watch- 
ing inside — where she is,” Bildoon 
said. “And four outside, watching 
them. Are you sure you’ve no oth- 
er clue to where you were?” 

“None.” 

“A complaint by McKie would 
fail now.” Bildoon said. “No — a 
better move might be to charge 
her with harboring a — ” he shud- 
dered — “Pan Spechi fugitive.” 

“Do we know who that fugitive 
is?” McKie asked. 


“Not yet. We haven’t decided 
the proper course yet. I’m leaving 
that up to legal.” He glanced at a 
Legal Department representative, 
a human female seated near Tuluk. 
“Hanaman?” 

Hanaman cleared her throat. 
She was a fragile woman, thick 
head of brown hair in gentle 
waves, a long oval face with soft 
blue eyes, delicate nose and chin, 
a wide full mouth. 

“You think it advisable to dis- 
cuss this in Council now?” she 
asked. 

“I do or I wouldn’t have called 
on you,” Bildoon said. 

F OR an instant McKie thought 
the reproof might bring real 
tears to Hanaman’s eyes. Then he 
saw the controlled, measuring 
stare she swept around the confer- 
ence room. She had brains, he 
saw, and knew there were those 
here susceptible to her sex. 

“McKie,” she said, “is it neces- 
sary for you to stand on the table? 
You’re not a Taprisiot.” 

“Thanks for reminding me,” he 
said. He jumped down, found a 
chairdog opposite her, stared back 
at her with a bland intensity. 

Presently she focused on Bil- 
doon, said, “To bring everyone up 
to date, Abnethe with one Palenki 
tried to flog the Caleban about two 
hours ago. Acting on our orders, 
an enforcer prevented the flogging. 
He cut off the Palenki’s arm with 
a raygen. As a result, Abnethe’s 
legal staff already is seeking an in- 
junction.” 

“Then they were prepared 
ahead of time,” McKie said. 


102 


IF 



“Obviously,” she agreed. 
“They’re alleging outlaw sabo- 
tage, misfeasance by a bureau, 
mayhem, misconduct, malicious 
mischief, felonious misprision — ” 
“Misfeasance?” McKie de- 
manded. 

“This is a robo-legum case, not 
a Gowachin jurisdiction,” Hana- 
man said. “We don’t have to ex- 
onerate the prosecutor before en- 
tering the — ’’ She broke off, 
shrugged. “Well, you know all 
that. BuSab is being held to an- 
swer for collective responsibility 
in the consequences of unlawful 
and wrongful acts committed by 
its agents in pursuance of the au- 
thority permitted them — ” 

“Wait a minute,” McKie inter- 
rupted. “This is bolder than I ex- 
pected from that crowd.” 

“ — and they charge,” Hanaman 
went on, “that the Bureau is guilty 
of a felony by criminal neglect in 
failure to prevent a felony from be- 
ing committed and not bringing to 
justice the offender after such 
commission.” 

“Have they named names or is 
it all John Does?” McKie asked. 
“No names.” 

“If they’re this bold, they’re 
desperate,” McKie said. “Why?” 
“They know we aren’t going to 
sit idly by and allow our people to 
be killed,” Bildoon said. “They 
know we have copies of the con- 
tract with the Caleban and that it 
gives Abnethe control of the Cale- 
ban’s jumpdoor. No one else could 
have been responsible for Furun- 
eo’s death and the perpetrator — ” 
“No one except the Caleban,” 
McKie said. 


A profound silence settled over 
the room. 

Presently Tuluk said, “You 
don’t seriou/ly believe — ” 

“No, I don’t,” McKie said. 
“But I couldn’t prove my belief 
to a robo-legum court. This does 
present an interesting possibility, 
though.” 

“Furuneo’s head,” Bildoon 
said. 

“Correct,” McKie said. “We 
demand Furuneo’s head.” 

“What if they contend the Cal- 
eban sequestered the head?” Han- 
aman asked. 

“I don’t intend asking them for 
it,” McKie said. “I’m going to ask 
the Caleban.” 

Hanaman nodded, her gaze in- 
tent on McKie with a light of ad- 
miration in her eyes. 

“Clever,” she breathed. “If they 
attempt to interfere — they’re 
guilty. But if we get the head — ” 

She looked at Tuluk. 

“What about it, Tuluk?” Bil- 
doon asked. “Think you could get 
anything from Furuneo’s brain?” 
“That depends on how much 
time has passed between the death 
and our key-in,” Tuluk said. 
“Nerve replay has limits, you 
know.” 

“We know,” Bildoon said. 

“Yeah,” McKie said. “Only one 
thing for me to do now; isn’t 
there?” 

“Looks that way,” Bildoon said. 

“Will you call off the enforcers 
or shall I?” McKie asked. 

“Now, wait a minute,” Bildoon 
said. “I know you have to go back 
to that Beachball but — ” 

“Alone,” McKie said. 


WHIPPING STAR 


103 



“Why?” 

“I can give the demand 'for 
Furuneo’s head in front of wit- 
nesses,” McKie said, “but that’s 
not enough. They want me. I got 
away from them and they’ve no 
idea how much I know about their 
hidey hole.” 

“Exactly what do you know?” 
Bildoon asked. 

“We’ve already been through 
that,” McKie said. 

“So you now see yourself as 
bait?” 

“I wouldn’t put it exactly that 
way,” McKie said. “But if I’m 
alone they mighT try bargaining 
with me. They might even — ” 

“They might even shorten you!” 
Bildoon snarled. 

“You don’t think it’s worth the 
try?” McKie asked. He stared 
around the room at the attentive 
faces. 

Hanaman cleared her throat. “I 
see a way out of this.” 

Everyone looked at her. 

“We could put McKie under 
Taprisiot surveillance,” she said. 

“He’s a ready-made victim if 
he’s sitting there in a snigger- 
trance,” Tuluk said. 

“Not if the Taprisiot contacts 
are minimal every few seconds.” 

“And as long. as I’m not yelling 
for help the Tappy breaks off,” 
McKie said. “Good.” 

“I don’t like it,” Bildoon said. 
“What if—” 

“You think they’ll talk openly 
to me if they see the plate full of 
enforcers? McKie asked. 

“No, but if we can prevent — ” 

“We can’t and you know it.” 


Bildoon glared at him but did 
not speak. 

“We must have those contacts 
between McKie and Abnethe if 
we’re going to try cross-charting 
to locate her position,” Tuluk said. 

Bildoon stared at the table in 
front of him. 

“That Beachball has a fixed po- 
sition on Cordiality,” McKie ar- 
gued. “Cordiality has a known 
planetary period. At the instant of 
each contact the Ball will be point- 
ing at a position in space — a line 
of least resistance for the contact. 
Enough contacts will describe a 
cone with — ” 

“ — with Abnethe somewhere in 
it,” Bildoon supplied, looking up. 
“Provided you’re right about this 
thing.” 

“The call connectives have to 
seek their conjunction through 
open space,” Tuluk said. “There 
must be no large stellar masses 
between call points, no hydrogen 
clouds of any serious dimensions, 
no groups of large planetary — ” 

“I understand the theory,” Bil- 
doon said. “But there’s no theory 
needed about what they can do to 
McKie. It’d take them less than 
two seconds to slip a jumpdoor 
over his neck and — ” 

He drew a finger across his 
throat. 

“So you have the Tappy contact 
me every two seconds,” McKie 
said. “Work it in relays. Get a 
string of agents in — ” 

“And what if they don’t try to 
contact you?” Bildoon thoughtful- 
ly asked. 

“Then we’ll have to sabotage 
them,” McKie said.

VIII 

W HEN you came right down 
to it, McKie decided, this 
Beachball wasn’t as weird a home 
as some he’d seen. It was hot, yes, 
but that fitted a peculiar require- 
ment of the occupant. Sentients 
existed in hotter climates. The 
giant spoon where the Caleban’s 
unpresence could be detected — 
well, that could be equated with a 
divan. Wall handles, spools there, 
lights and whatnot — all those were 
almost conventional in appear- 
ance, although McKie seriously 
doubted he could understand their 
functions. The automated homes 
of Breedywie, though, displayed 
more outlandish control consoles. 

The ceiling here was a bit low 
but he could stand without stoop- 
ing. The purple gloom was no 
stranger than the variglare of 
Gowachin where most offworld 
sentients had to wear protective 
goggles while visiting friends. The 
Beachball’s floor covering did not 
appear to be a conventional living 
organism, but it was soft. Right 
now it smelled of a standard pyro- 
cene cleaner-disinfectant and the 
fumes were rather stifling in the 
heat. 

McKie shook his head. The fly- 
buzz zzzzt of Taprisiot contact 
every two seconds was annoying 
but he found he could override the 
distraction. 

Your friend reached ultimate 
discontinuity , the Caleban had ex- 
plained. His substance has been re- 
moved. 

For substance , read blood-and- 
body, McKie translated. He hoped 

WHIPPING STAR 


the translation achieved some de- 
gree of accuracy but he cautioned 
himself not to be too sure of that. 

If we could only have a little air 
current in here, McKie thought. 
Just a small breeze . 

He mopped perspiration from 
his forehead, drank from one of 
the water jugs he’d provided for 
himself. 

“You still there, Fanny Mae?’’ 

You observe my presence? 

“Almost.’’ 

That is our mutual problem — 
seeing each other, the Caleban 
said. 

“You’re using time-ordinal 
verbs with more confidence, I 
note.’’ 

I get the hang of them, yes? 

“I hope so.’’ 

I date the verb as a nodal posi- 
tion. 

“I don’t believe I want that ex- 
plained.’’ 

Very well — I comply. 

“I’d like to try again to under- 
stand how the floggings are 
timed.’’ ' 

When shapes reach proper pro- 
portion. 

“You already said that. What 
shapes?’’ 

A I ready? That signifies earlier? 

“Earlier,’’ McKie said. “That’s 
right. You said that about shapes 
before.’’ 

Earlier and before and already. 
Yes — times of different conjunc- 
tion by linear alteration of inter- 
secting connectives. 

Time, for the Caleban, was a 
position on a line, McKie re- 
minded himself, recalling Tuluk’s 
attempt at explanation. He had to 


105 



look for the subtly refined differ- 
ences — they were all this creature 
saw. 

“What shapes?” McKie re- 
peated. 

Shapes defined by duration 
lines. I see many duration lines. 
You , oddly, carry visual sensation 
of one line only. Very strange. 
Other teachers explain this to self 
but understanding fails — extreme 
constriction. Self admires mole- 
cular acceleration but — mainte- 
nance exchange confuses. 

Confuses! 

“What molecular acceleration?” 

Teachers define molecule as 
smallest characteristic unit of ele- 
ment or compound. True? 

“That’s right.” 

This carries difficulty in under- 
standing unless ascribed by self 
to perceptive difference between 
our species. Say, instead, molecule 
perhaps equals smallest physical 
unit visible to species. True? 

What was the difference? It was 
all gibberish. How had they gotten 
off onto molecules and accelera- 
tion from the proper proportion of 
undefined shapes? 

“Why acceleration?” 

Acceleration always occurs 
along convergence lines we use 
while speaking , one to another. 

Oh, damn! McKie lifted a water 
jug, drank, choked on a swallow. 
He bent forward, gasping. 

When he could manage it he 
said, “The heat in here — molecular 
speedup?” 

Do these concepts not inter- 
change? the Caleban asked. 

“Never mind that,” McKie 
blurted, still spitting water. “When 


you speak to me — is that what ac- 
celerates the molecules?” 

Self assumes this true condition. 

McKie put down the water jug 
carefully, capped it. He began to 
laugh. 

Not understand these terms, the 
Caleban objected. 

McKie shook his head. The 
Caleban’s words still came at him 
with that non-speech quality but he 
detected definite querulous notes 
— overtones. Accents? He gave it 
up. There was something, though. 

Not understand, the Caleban in- 
sisted. 

This made McKie laugh all the 
harder. 

“Oh, my,” he gasped when he 
could catch his breath. “The an- 
cient wheeze was right all along 
and nobody knew it. Oh, my. Talk 
is just hot air — ” 

Again laughter convulsed him. 

Presently he lay back, inhaled 
deeply. In a moment, he sat up, 
took another swallow of water, 
capped the jug. 

Teach, the Caleban commanded. 
Explain these unusual terms. 

“Terms? Oh — certainly. Laugh- 
ter. It’s our common response to 
nonfatal surprise. No other signif- 
icant communicative content.” 

Laughter. Other nodal encoun- 
ters with term noted. 

“Other nodal — ” McKie broke 
off. “You’ve heard the word be- 
fore, you mean?” 

Before. Yes. I — self — / attempt 
understanding of term, laughter. 
We explore meaning now? 

“Let’s not.” 

Negative reply? 

“That’s correct — negative. I’m

much more curious about what 
you said about — maintenance ex- 
change. That was what you said, 
wasn’t it? Maintenance exchange 
confuses?” 

I attempt define position for you 
odd one-tracks. 

“One-tracks, that’s how you 
think of us, eh?” 

McKie felt suddenly small and 
inadequate. 

Relationship of connectives, one 
to many, many to one, the Caleban 
said. Maintenance exchange. 

“How in the hell did we get into 
this deadend conversation?” 

You seek positional referrents 
for placement of floggings, that 
begins conversation. 

“Placement — yeah.” 

You understand S' eye effect? 

M CKIE exhaled slowly. To the 
best of his knowledge no 
Caleban had ever before volun- 
teered a discussion of the S’eye ef- 
fect. The one-two-three of how to 
use the mechanism of the jump- 
doors — yes, this was something 
they could (and did) explain. But 
not the theory. 

“I — uh — use the jumpdoors,” 
McKie said. “I know something of 
how the control mechanism is as- 
sembled and tuned to — ” 
Mechanism not coincide with 
effect! 

“Uhhh, certainly,” McKie a- 
greed. “The word’s not the thing.” 
Precisement! We say — / trans- 
late, you understand? We say, 
‘ Term evades node.' You catch the 
hanging of this term, self thinks. 

“I — uh — get the hang t>f it,” 
McKie agreed. 


Recommend hang-line as good 
thought. Self, I believe we ap- 
proach true communication. It 
wonders me. 

“You wonder about it,” McKie 
corrected. 

Negative. It wonders about me. 

“That’s great,” McKie said in 
a flat voice. “That’s communica- 
tion?” 

Understanding diffuses — scat- 
ters? Yes — understanding scatters 
when we discuss connectives. I ob- 
serve connectives of your — psyche. 
For psyche, I understand ' other 
self.' True? 

“Whyrnot?” 

I see — the Caleban ignored 
McKie’s defeated tone — psyche 
patterns, perhaps their colors. Ap- 
proachments and outreachings 
touch my awareness. I come, 
through this , to unwinding of in- 
telligence and perhaps understand 
what you mean by term — stellar 
mass. Self understands by being 
stellar mass, you hang this, McKie? 

“Hang this? Oh, sure — sure.” 

Good. Comes now an under- 
standing of your — wanderings? 
Difficult word, McKie. Very likely 
this an uncertain exchange. Wan- 
dering equals movement along one 
line for you. This cannot exist for 
us. One moves, all move for 
Caleban on own plane. S' eye effect 
combines all movements and vis- 
ion. I see you to other place of 
your desired wandering. 

McKie, his interest renewed by 
this odd rambling, said, “You see 
us — that’s what moves us from 
one place to another?” 

I hear sentient of your plane say 
sameness, McKie. Sentient say, 7

will see you to the door. ' So? See- 
ing moves. 

Seeing moves? McKie won- 
dered. He mopped his forehead, 
his lips. The Beachball was so 
damned hot. What did all this have 
to do with maintenance exchange? 
Whatever that was. 

Stellar mass maintains and ex- 
changes, the Caleban said. Not see 
through, the self. S' eye connective 
discontinues. You call this — pri- 
vacy? Cannot say. This Caleban 
exists alone of self on your plane. 
Lonely. 

We're all lonely, McKie 
thought. 

He put down a surge of irrita- 
tion at the zzzz/-beat of the Ta- 
prisiot intrusions. That, at least, 
was companionship. 

“Do Taprisiots send our mes- 
sages across space the same way?” 
he asked. “Do they see the calls?” 

Taprisiot very weak. Taprisiot 
not possess Caleban energy. Selj 
energy, you understand? 

“1 dunno. Maybe.” 

Taprisiot see very thin, very 
short. Taprisiot not see through 
stellar mass of self. Sometimes 
Taprisiot ask for — boost? Ampli- 
fication. Caleban provide service. 
Maintenance exchange, you hang? 
Taprisiot pay, we pay, you pay. 
All pay energy. You call energy 
demand — hunger, not so? 

“Oh, hell,” McKie said. “Fm 
not getting the half of — ” 

BRAWNY Palenki arm car- 
rying a whip inserted itself in- 
to the space above the giant spoon. 
The whip cracked, sent a geyser of 


green sparks into the purple gloom. 
Arm and whip were gone before 
McKie could move. 

“Fanny Mae,” McKie whis- 
pered, “you still there?” 

Silence— then: No laughter, 

McKie. Thing you call surprise — 
but no laughter. I break line there. 
An abruptness, that flogging. 

McKie exhaled, noted the mind- 
clock timing of the incident, re- 
layed the coordinates at the next 
Taprisiot contact. 

There was no sense talking 
about pain, he thought. It was 
equally fruitless to explore inhaling 
whips or exhaling substance — or 
maintenance exchanges or hunger 
or stellar masses or Calebans mov- 
ing other sentients by the energy of 
seeing. Communication was 
bogged down. 

He and Fanny Mae had 
achieved something, though. Tuluk 
had been right. The S’eye contacts 
for the floggings required some 
timing or periodicity that could be 
identified. Perhaps there was a 
line-of-sight involved. One thing 
sure: Abnethe had her feet planted 
on a real planet somewhere. She 
and her mob of psycho friends — 
her psycho-phants! — all had a posi- 
tion in space which could be lo- 
cated. She had Palenkis, renegade 
Wreaves, an outlaw Pan Spechi — 
gods knew what all. She had 
Beautybarbers, too, and Ta- 
prisiots and this Caleban all used 
the same sort of energy to do their 
work. 

“Could we try again,” McKie 
asked, “to locate Abnethe’s plan- 
et?” 

Contract forbids.

“You have to honor it, eh? Even 
to the death?” 

Honor to ultimate discontin- 
uity , yes. 

“And that’s pretty near, is it?” 

Position of ultimate discon- 
tinuity becomes visible to self , the 
Caleban said. Perhaps this equates 
with near. 

Again arm and whip flicked into 
being, showered the air with a 
cascade of green sparks and with- 
drew. 

McKie darted forward, stopped 
beside the spoon bowl. He had 
never before ventured quite this 
close to the Caleban. There was 
more heat near the bowl and he 
felt a tingling sensation along his 
arms. The shower of green sparks 
had left no mark on the carpeting, 
no residual substance, nothing. 
McKie felt the insistent attraction 
of the Caleban’s unpresence, a dis- 
turbing intensity this near. He 
forced himself to turn away. His 
palms were wet with fear. 

What else was he afraid of here? 

“Those two attacks came pretty 
close together,” McKie said. 

Positional adjacency noted. 
Next coherence more distanf . You 
say 'farther away?* True? 

“Yeah. Will the next flogging 
be your last?” 

Self not know, the Caleban said. 
Your presence lessens flogging 
intensity. You — reject? Ahhh, re- 
pel! 

“No doubt,” McKie said. “I 
wish I knew why the end of you 
means the end of everyone else.” 

You transfer self of you with 
S’eye, the Caleban said. So? 

“Everyone does.” 


Why? You teach of explanation 
this? 

“It’s centralizing the whole 
damn universe. It’s — it’s created

moon planets, gynecology planets,

I saw, fewer than a fraction of one 
per cent of the sentiment popula- 
tion had never used a S’eye jump- 
door.” 

Truth. Such use creates con- 
nectives, McKie. You must hang 
this. Connectives must shatter with 
my discontinuity. Shatter conveys 
ultimate discontinuity for all who 
use jump door S 'eye. 

“If you say so. I still don’t un- 
derstand.” 

It occurs, McKie, because my 
fellows choose me for — coordina- 
tor? Inadequate term. Funnel? 
Handler, perhaps. No, still inade- 
quate. Ahhh! I, self of I, am S' eye! 

McKie backed away, retreating 
from such a wave of sadness that 
he felt he could not contain it. He 
wanted to scream in protest. Tears 
flowed down his cheeks unbidden. 
A sob choked him. Sadness! His 
body was reacting to it but the 
emotion came from outside him- 
self. 

Slowly it faded. 

McKie blew air soundlessly 
through his lips. He still trembled 
from the passage of that emotion. 
It had been the Caleban’s emo- 
tion, he realized. But it came out 
like the waves of heat in this room,

IF 



swept over and immersed every 
nerve receptor in its path. 

Sadness. 

Responsibility for all those im- 
pending deaths, no doubt. 

/ am S' eye! 

W HAT in the name of all the 
devils in the universe could 
the Caleban mean by such a 
strange claim? He thought of each 
jumpdoor passage. Connectives? 
Threads, perhaps. Each being 
caught by the S’eye effect trailed 
threads of himself through, the 
jumpdoors. Was that it? Fanny 
Mae had used the word ‘funnel.’ 
Every traveler went through her — 
hands? Whatever. And when she 
ceased to exist the threads broke. 
All died. 

“Why weren’t we warned about 
this when you offered us the S’eye 
effect?” 

Warned? 

“Yes. You offered—” 

Not offer. Fellows explain ef- 
fect. Sentients of your wave ex- 
pose great joy. They offer exchange 
of maintenance. You call this pay, 
not so? 

“We should have been warned.” 
Why? 

“Well, you don’t live forever, do 
you?” 

Explain this term, forever. 
“Forever — always. Infinity.” 
Sentients of your wave seek in- 
finity? 

“Not for individuals but for — ” 
Sentient species, they seek in- 
finity? 

“Of course they do.” 

Why? 

“Doesn’t everyone?” 


But what about other species 
for which yours must make way? 
You not believe in evolution? 

“Evo — ” McKie shook his head 
sharply. “What’s that have to do 
with it?” 

All beings have own day and 
depart, the Caleban said. Day cor- 
rect term? Day, unit of time, al- 
io ted linearity, normal extent of 
existence — you hang this? 

McKie’s mouth moved but no 
words came out. 

Length of line, time of existence , 
the Caleban said. Approximately 
translated , correct? 

“But what gives you the right 
to — terminate us?” McKie de- 
manded, finding his voice. 

Right not assumed, McKie. 
Given condition of proper con- 
nectives, another of my fellows 
takes up S’eye — control before 
self reaches ultimate discontinuity. 
Unusual — circumstance rejects 

such solution here. Mliss Abnethe 
and — associates shorten your one- 
track. My fellows leave. 

“They ran for it while they had 
time? I understand.” 

Time — yes, your single-track 
line. This comparison provides 
suitable concept. Inadequate but 
sufficient. 

“And you are definitely the last 
Caleban in our— wave?” 

Self alone. Terminal end-point 
Caleban — yes. Self confirms de- 
scription. 

“Wasn’t there any way to save 
yourself?” McKie asked. 

Save? Ahhh — avoid? Evade! 

Yes, evade ultimate discontinuity. 
This you suggest? 

“I’m asking if there wasn’t some 


WHIPPING STAR 


111 



way for you to escape the way 
your fellows did?” 

Way exists but result same for 
your wave. 

“You could save yourself but it 
would end us — is that it?” 

You not possess honor concept? 
Save self, lose honor. 

,, Touche\ ,, McKie said. 

Explain touche. New term. 

“Eh? Oh, that’s a very, old, 
ancient term.” 

Linear beginning term, you 
say? Yes, those best with nodal 
frequency. 

“Nodal frequency?” 

You say — often. Nodal fre- 
quency contains often. 

“They mean the same thing? I 
see.” 

Not same. Similar. 

“I stand corrected.” 

Explain touche. What meaning 
conveys this term? 

“Meaning conveys— yeah. It’s 
a fencing term.” 

Fencing? You signify contain- 
ment? 

McKie explained fencing as 
best he could with a side journey 
into swordsmanship, the concept 
of single combat, competition. 

Effective touch, the Caleban 
interrupted, her words conveying 
definite wonder. Nodal intersec- 
tion. Touche '! Ahhh-ahhh! This 
contains why we find your species 
to fascinate us. This concept! Cut- 
ting line: touche 7 Pierced by mean- 
ing: touche '! 

“Ultimate discontinuity,” Mc- 
Kie snarled. “ Touched How far 
away is your next touche with the 
whip?” 

Intersection of whip touche! 


You seek position of linear dis- 
placement, yes. It moves me. We 
perhaps occupy our linearities yet 
g-but self suggests another species 
may need these dimensions. We 
leave, outgo from existence, then. 
Not so? 

When McKie didn’t answer, the 
Caleban said: McKie, you hang 
my meaning? 

“I think I’m going to sabotage 
you,” McKie muttered. 

IX 

C HEO, the ego-frozen Pan 
Spechi, stared out across the 
forest toward sunset over the sea. 
It was good, he thought, that the 
Ideal World contained such a sea. 
This tower Mliss had ordered built 
in a city of lesser buildings and 
spires commanded a view which 
included also the distant plain and 
far away mountains of the interior. 

A steady wind blew against his 
left cheek, stirred his yellow hair. 
He wore green trousers and an 
open-mesh shirt of dull gold and 
gray. The clothing gave a subtle 
accent to his humanoid appear- 
ance, revealing the odd ripples of 
alien muscles here and there about 
his body. 

An amused smile occupied his 
mouth but not his eyes. He had 
Pan Spechi eyes, many-faceted, 
glistening — although the facets 
were edge-faded by his ego-sur- 
gery. The eyes watched the insect 
movements of various sentients on 
streets and bridgeway s below him. 
At the same time they reported on 
the sky overhead (a far-away flock 
of birds, streamers of sunset 


112 


IF 



clouds) and told him of the view 
toward the sea and the nearby bal- 
lus trade. 

We're going to pull it ojj. 

He glanced at the antique chron- 
ograph Mliss had given him. Crude 
thing, but it showed the sunset 
hour. They had had to disengage 
from the Taprisiot mindclock 
system, though. This crude device 
showed two hours to go until the 
next contact. 

They can't stop us. 

But maybe they can . 

He thought about McKie then. 
How had the BuSab agent found 
this place? And finding it, how had 
he come here? McKie sat in the 
Beachball with the Caleban right 
now — bait, obviously. Bait! 

For what? 

Cheo didn’t enjoy the contra- 
dictory emotions surging back 
and forth through him. He had 
broken the most basic Pan Spechi 
law. He had captured his creche’s 
ego and abandoned his four mates 
to a mindless existence termina- 
ting in mindless death. A renegade 
surgeon’s instruments had excised 
the organ which united the pen- 
tarchal Pan Spechi family across 
all space. The surgery had left a 
scar on Cheo’s forehead and a scar 
on his soul but he had never imag- 
ined he would find such delicate 
relish in the experience. 

Nothing could take the ego from 
him. 

But he was alone, too. 

Death would end it, of course, 
but all creatures had that to face. 

And thanks to Mliss, he had a 
retreat from which no other Pan 
Spechi could extricate him — unless 


— but there would be no other 
Pan Spechi very soon. There would 
be no other organized sentients at 
all except the handful Mliss had 
brought here to her Ark with its 
mad Boers and Blacks. 

Abnethe came hurrying onto 
the observation deck behind him. 
His ears, as multi-planar in dis- 
crimination as his eyes, marked 
the emotions in her footsteps — 
boredom, worry, the constant fear 
which constricted her being. 

Cheo turned. 

She had been to a Beautybarber, 
he observed. Red hair now 
crowned her lovely face. McKie 
had red hair, too, Cheo reminded 
himself. She threw herself onto a 
reclining chairdog, stretched her 
legs. 

“What’s your hurry?’’ he asked. 
“Those Beautybarbers,” she 
snapped. “They want to go home.” 
“Send them.’’ 

“But where will I find others?’’ 
“That is a proper problem, isn’t 
it?’’ 

“You’re making fun of me, 
Cheo. Don’t.” 

“Then tell them they can’t go 
home.” 

“I did.” 

“Did you tell them why?” 

“Of course not. What a thing to 
say!” 

“You told Furuneo.” 

“I learned my lesson. Where are 
my legal people?” 

“They’ve already gone.” 

“But I had other things to dis- 
cuss with them.” 

“Won’t it wait?” 

“You knew we had other busi- 
ness. Why did you let them go?” 


WHIPPING STAR 


113 



“Mliss, you don’t really want to 
know the other matter on their 
minds.” 

“The Caleban’s to blame,” she 
said. “That’s our story and no one 
can disprove it. What was the other 
matter the legal numb-heads 
wanted to discuss?” 

“Mliss, drop it.” 

“Cheo!” 

His Pan Spechi eyes glittered 
suddenly. “As you wish. They 
conveyed a demand from BuSab. 
They have asked the Caleban for 
Furuneo’s head.” 

“His — ” She paled. “But how 
did they know we — ” 

“They know nothing. But theirs 
was an obvious move under the 
circumstances.” 

“What did you tell them?” she 
whispered. She stared at his face. 

“I told them the Caleban closed 
the S’eye jumpdoor just as Furu- 
neo was entering it of his own 
volition.” 

“But they know we have a mon- 
opoly on that S’eye,” she said, he^ 
voice stronger. “Damn them!” 
“Ahhh,” Cheo said, “but Fanny 
Mae has been moving McKie and 
his friends around. That indicates 
we have no monopoly.” 

“That’s exactly what I said be- 
fore. Isn’t it?” 

“It gives us the perfect delaying 
tactic,” he said. “Fanny Mae sent 
the head somewhere and we don’t 
know where. I’ve told her, of 
course, to deny this request.” 

She swallowed. “Is that — what 
you told them?” 

“Of course.” 

“But if they question the Cale- 
ban—” 


“They’re just as likely to get a 
confusing answer as a usable one.” 
“That was very clever of you, 
Cheo.” 

“Isn’t that why you keep me 
around?” 

“I keep you around for mysteri- 
ous reasons of my own,” she said, 
smiling. 

“I depend on that,” he said. 
“You know,” she said, “I’ll 
miss them.” 

“Miss whom?” 

“The ones who hunt us.” 

B ILDOON stood in the door- 
way to Tuluk’s personal lab, 
his back to the long outer room 
where the Wreave’s assistants did 
most of their work. The BuSab 
chief’s deepset eyes held a faceted 
glitter, a fire that failed to match 
the composure of his humanoid 
Pan Spechi face. 

Tuluk was working at a bench 
against the opposite wall. He had 
a length of bullwhip rawhide 
stretched between two clamps. 
Parallel with the rawhide and 
about a millimeter below it was a 
metal pole, balanced on air with- 
out visible support. Between raw- 
hide and pole could be seen flick- 
ers of miniature lightning — it 
danced along the entire length of 
the gap. Tuluk was bent over, read- 
ing meters set into the bench be- 
neath the device. 

“Am I interrupting anything?” 
Bildoon asked. 

Tuluk turned a knob on the 
bench, waited, turned the knob 
once more. He caught the pole as 
the invisible supporting force re- 
leased it. He racked the pole on 


114 


IF 



supports against the back wall 
above the bench. 

“That is a silly question,” he 
said, turning. 

“It is, at that,” Bildoon said. 
“We have a problem.” 

“Without problems, we have no 
employment,” Tuluk said. 

“I don’t think we’re going to get 
Furuneo’s head,” Bildoon said. 

“It’s been so long now, we 
probably couldn’t have gotten a 
reliable nerve replay anyway,” 
Tuluk said. He screwed his face 
slit into an S-curve, an expression 
he knew aroused amusement 
among other sentients. But it 
represented intense thought for 
a Wreave. “What do the astrono- 
mers say about the star pattern 
McKie saw on that mysterious 
planet?” 

“They think there may have 
been an error in the mindcord.” 
“Oh. Why?” 

“For one thing, there isn’t even 
a hint, not the slightest subjective 
indication of variation in stellar 
magnitudes.” 

“All the visible stars had the 
same light intensity?” 
“Apparently.” 

“Odd.” 

“And the nearest pattern simi- 
larity,” Bildoon said, “is one that 
doesn’t exist any more.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Well — there’s a Big Dipper, a 
Little Dipper, various other con- 
stellations and zodiac similarities 
but—” 

He shrugged. 

Tuluk stared at him blankly. 
“I don’t recognize the refer- 
ences,” he said, presently. 


“Oh, yes — I forgot,” Bildoon 
said. “We Pan Spechi, when we 
decided to copy human form, 
explored their history with some 
care. These patterns of stars are 
ones that were visible from their 
ancient homeworld.” 

“I see. Another oddity to go 
with what I’ve discovered about 
the material of this whip.” 

“What’s that?” 

“It’s very strange. Parts of 
this leather betray a subatomic 
structure of peculiar align- 
ment.” 

“Peculiar? How?” 

“Aligned. Perfectly aligned. 
I’ve never seen anything like it 
outside certain rather fluid en- 
ergy phenomena. It’s as though 
the material had been subjected 
to some peculiar force or stress. 
The result is, in some ways, 
similar to neomaser alignment 
of light quanta.” 

“Wouldn’t that require enor- 
mous energy?” 

“Presumably.” 

“But what could cause it?” 

“I don’t know. The interest- 
ing thing is that it doesn’t ap- 
pear to be a permanent change. 
The structure shows character- 
istics like plastic memory. It’s 
slowly snapping back into rea- 
sonably familiar forms.” 

Bildoon Heard the emphasis 
that betrayed Tuluk’s distur- 
bance. 

“Reasonably familiar?” he 
asked. 

“That’s another thing,” Tu- 
luk said. “Let me explain. These 
subatomic structures and their 
resultant overstructures of 


WHIPPING STAR 


115 



genetic message units undergo 
slow evolution. We can, by 
comparing structures, date 
some samples to within two or 
three thousand standard years. 
Since cattle cells form the basic 
protein for vat culture food, we 
have fairly complete records on 
them over a very long time in- 
deed. The strange thing about 
the samples in this piece of raw- 
hide — ” he gestured with a 
mandibular extensor — “is that 
its pattern is very ancient.” 

“How ancient?” 

“Perhaps several hundred thou- 
sand years.” 

Bildoon absorbed this. Then: 
“But you told us earlier that 
this rawhide was only a couple 
of years old.” 

“According to our cataly- 
zing tests, it is.” 

“Could this alignment stress 
have mixed up the pattern?” 

“Conceivably.” 

“You doubt it, then?” 

“I do.” 

“You’re not trying .to tell me 
that whip was brought forward 
through time?” 

“I’m not trying to tell you 
anything outside the facts I’ve 
reported. Two tests, previously 
considered reliable, do not 
agree as to the dating of this 
material.” 

“Time travel’s an impossi- 
bility,” Bildoon said. 

“So we’ve always assumed.” 

“We know it. We know it 
mathematically and pragmati- 
cally. It’s a fiction device, a 
myth, an amusing concept em- 
ployed by entertainers. We reject 


it and we are left without paradox. 
Only one conclusion remains: the 
alignment stress, whatever that 
was, changed the pattern.” 

“If the rawhide were — squeezed 
through a subatomic filter of some 
sort, that might account for it,” 
Tuluk said. “But since I have no 
such filter or the power to do this 
theoretical squeezing, I cannot 
test it.” 

“You must have some thoughts 
about it, though.” 

“I do. I cannot conceive of a fil- 
ter that would do this thing with- 
out destroying the materials sub- 
jected to such forces.” 

“Then what you're saying,” 
Bildoon said, his voice rising in 
angry frustration, “is that an im- 
possible device did an impossible 
thing to that impossible piece of 
-of-” 

“Yes, sir,” Tuluk said. 

B ILDOON noticed that Tuluk’s 
aides in the outer room were 
turning their faces toward him, 
showing signs of amusement. He 
stepped fully into the lab, closed 
the door. 

“I came down here hoping 
you’d found something that might 
force their hand,” Bildoon said, 
“and you give me conundrums.” 
“Your displeasure doesn’t 
change the facts,” Tuluk said. 

“No, I guess it doesn’t.” 

“The structure of the Palenki 
arm cells was aligned in a similar 
fashion,” Tuluk said. “But only 
around the cut.” 

“You anticipated my next 
question.” 

“It was obvious. Passage 


116 


IF 



through a jumpdoor doesn’t ac- 
count for it. We sent several of 
our people through jumpdoors 
with various materials and tested 
random cells — living and dead — 
fora check.” 

“Two conundrums in an hour 
is more than I like,” Bildoon said. 

“Two?” 

“We now have twenty-eight 
positional incidents of Abnethe 
flogging that Caleban or attempt- 
ing to flog it. That’s enough to 
show us they do not define a cone 
in space. Unless she’s jumping 
around from planet to planet, 
that theory’s wrong.” 

“Given the powers of that S’eye, 
she could be jumping around.” 

“We don’t think so. That isn’t 
her way. She’s a nesting bird. She 
likes a citadel. She’s the kind who 
castles in chess when she doesn’t 
have to.” 

“She could be sending her 
Palenkis.” 

- “She’s there with them every 
time.” 

“We’ve collected six whips and 
arms in all,” Tuluk said. “Do you 
want me to repeat these tests on all 
of them?” 

Bildoon stared at the Wreave. 
The question wasn’t like him. Tu- 
luk was plodding, thorough. 

“What would you rather be 
doing?” Bildoon asked. 

“We have twenty-eight exam- 
ples,” you say. “Twenty-eight is 
one of the euclidian perfects. It’s 
four times the prime seven. The 
number strongly indicates random- 
ness. But we’re faced with a situa- 
tion apparently excluding random- 
ness. Ergo, an organizing pattern 


is at work which is not revealed by 
analytic numbering as far as we’ve 
taken it. I would like to subject 
the ^pacing — both in time and 
physical dimension — to a complete 
analysis, compare for any simi- 
larities we — ” 

“You’d put an assistant on the 
other whips and arms to check 
them out?” 

“That goes without saying.” 

Bildoon shook his head. “What 
Abnethe’s doing — it’s impossible!” 

“If she does a thing, how can it 
be impossible?” 

“She and her crew have to be 
somewhere,” Bildoon snapped. 

“I find it very strange,” Tuluk 
said, “this trait you share mih 
humans of stating the obvious in 
suc^emphatic fashion.” 

“Oh, go to hell,” Bildoon said. 
He turned, slammed out of the 
lab. 

Tuluk, racing to the door after 
him, opened it and called at the 
retreating back, “It is a Wreave 
belief that we already are in hell.” 

He returned to his bench, mut- 
tering. Humans and Pan Spechi — 
impossible creatures. Except for 
McKie. Now, there was a human 
who occasionally achieved analytic 
rapport with sentients capable of 
higher logic. Well — every species 
had its exceptions to the norm. 

B Y AN effort of communica- 
tion he still did not completely 
understand, McKie had talked the 
Caleban into opening the Beach- 
ball’s external port. This per- 
mitted a bath of spray-washed air 
to flow to where he sat. It also ac- 
complished one other thing — it 


WHIPPING STAR 


117 



allowed a crew of watchers out- 
side to hold eyeball contact with 
him. He had just about given up 
hoping Abnethe would rise to the 
bait. There would have to be an- 
other solution. Visual contact 
with watchers also permitted a 
longer spacing between Taprisiot 
guard contacts. He found the new 
spacing less tiresome. 

Morning sunshine splashed 
across the lip of the opening into 
the Beachball. McKie put a hand 
into the light, felt the warmth. He 
knew he should be moving around, 
making a poor target of himself, 
but the presence of the watchers 
made attack unlikely. Besides, he 
was tired, drugged to alertness and 
full of the odd emotions induced 
by angaret. Movement seemed an 
empty effort. If they wanted to kill 
him they were going to do it. Fur- 
uneo’s death proved that. 

From where he sat McKie could 
see out across the lava shelf to the 
rocky palisades and a mossy car- 
peting of sea growth exposed at the 
cliff base by the retreating tide. 

“Suppose we have it all wrong,” 
he said, speaking over his shoulder 
toward the Caleban. “Suppose we 
really aren’t communicating with 
each other at all. What if we’ve 
just been making noises, assuming 
a communication content that 
doesn’t exist?” 

/ fail of understanding, McKie. 
The hang doesn’t get me. 

McKie turned slightly. The 
Caleban was doing something 
strange with the air around its 
position. The oval stage he had 
seen earlier shimmered once more 
into view, disappeared. A golden 


halo appeared at one side of the 
giant spoon, rose like a smoke 
ring, crackled electrically and 
vanished. 

“We’re assuming,” McKie said, 
“that when you say something to 
me I respond with meaningful 
words directly related to your 
statement — and that you do the 
same. This may not be the cast at 
all.” 

Unlikely. \ 

“So it’s unlikely. What are you 
doing there?” 

Doing ?* 

“All that activity around you.” 

Attempt making self visible on 
your wave. 

“Can you do it?” 

Possible. 

A bell-shaped red glow formed 
above the spoon, stretched into a 
straight line, resumed it bell curve, 
began whirling like a child’s jump 
rope. 

What see you? the Caleban 
asked. 

McKie described the whirling 
red rope. 

Very odd, the Caleban said. / 
flex creativity and you report 
visible sensation. You need yet 
that opening to exterior condi- 
tions? 

“The open port? It makes it one 
helluva lot more comfortable in 
here.” 

Comfort — concept self fails to 
understand. 

“Does the opening prevent you 
from becoming visible?” 

It performs magnetic distrac- 
tion, no more. McKie shrugged. 

“How much more flogging can 
you take?” 


IF 


118 



Explain much. 

“You’ve left the track again,” 
McKie said. 

Correct! That forms achieve - 
ment, McKie. 

“How is it an achievement?” 

Self leaves communicative track 
and you achieve awareness of 
same. 

“All right, that’s an achieve- 
ment. Where’s Abnethe?” 

Contract — 

“ — prohibits revealing her loca- 
tion,” McKie completed. “Maybe 
you can tell me, then — is she jump- 
ing around or remaining on one 
planet?” 

That helps you locate her? 

“How in fifty-seven hells do I 
know?” 

Probability smaller than fifty - 
seven elements , the Caleban said. 
Abnethe occupies relatively static 
position on specific planet. 

“But we can’t find any pattern 
to her attacks on you or where 
they originate.” 

You cannot see connectives. 

T HE whirling red rope flickered 
in and out of existence above 
the giant spoon. Abruptly it shifted 
color to a glowing yellow, van- 
ished. 

“You just disappeared,” McKie 
said. 

Not my person visible. 

“How’s that?” 

You not seeing person-self. 
“That’s what I said.” 

Not say. Visibility to you not 
represent sameness of my person. 
You visible-see effect. 

“I wasn’t seeing you, eh? That 
was just some effect you created.” 


Correct. 

“I didn’t think it was you. 
You’re going to be something 
more shapely. I do notice some- 
thing, though. There are moments 
when you used our verb tenses 
better — I even spotted some fairly 
normal constructions.” 

Self hangs this get me. 

“Yeah, well — maybe you’re not 
getting the hang of our language, 
after all.” 

McKie stood up, stretched, 
moved closer to the open port, in- 
tending to peer out. As he moved, 
a shimmering silver loop dropped 
out of the air where he had been. 
He whirled in time to see it snake 
back through the small vortal tube 
of a jumpdoor. 

“Abnethe, is that you?” McKie 
demanded. 

There was no answer. The jump- 
door snapped out of existence. 

The enforcers watching from 
outside rushed to the port. 

One called, “You all right, 
McKie?” 

McKie waved him to silence, 
took a raygen from his pocket, 
held it loosely in his hand. 

“Fanny Mae,” he said, “are they 
trying to capture or kill me the 
way they took care of Furuneo?” 

Observe theyness , the Caleban 
said. Furuneo not having exist- 
ence, observable intentions un- 
known. 

“Did you see what just hap- 
pened here?” McKie asked. 

Self contains awareness of S’eye 
employment , certain activity of 
employer persons. Activity ceases. 

McKie rubbed his left hand 
across his neck. He wondered if he

could bring the raygen into play 
quickly enough to cut any snare 
they might drop over his head. 
That silver thing dropping into the 
room had looked suspiciously 
like a noose. 

“Is that how they got Furu- 
neo?” McKie asked. “Did they 
drop a noose over his neck and 
pull him into the jumpdoor?” 

Discontinuity removes person oj 
sameness, the Caleban said. 

McKie shrugged, gave it up. 
That was more or less the answer 
the Caleban gave to all questions 
about Furuneo’s death. 

Oddly, McKie discovered he 
was hungry. He wiped perspiration 
from his jaw and chin, cursed un- 
der his breath. There was no real 
assurance that what he heard in 
the Caleban’s words represented 
true communication. Even grant- 
ing some communication, how 
could he depend on the Caleban’s 
interpretations or the Caleban’s 
honesty? When the damn thing 
spoke, though, it radiated such a 
sense of sincerity that disbelief be- 
came almost impossible. McKie 
rubbed his chin, trying to catch an 
elusive thought. Strange. Here he 
was, hungry, angry and afraid. He 
had no place to run. He had to 
solve this problem. Imperfect as 
communication with the Caleban 
actually was, the warning from the 
creature could not be ignored. Too 
many sentients already had died 
or gone insane. 

H E SHOOK his head at the fly- 
buzz of Taprisiot contact. 
Damn surveillance. This contact, 
however, failed to break off. It 


was Siker, the Laclac Director of 
Discretion. Siker had detected 
McKie’s disturbed emotions and, 
instead of breaking contact, 
locked in. 

“No!” McKie raged. He felt 
himself stiffen into the mumbling 
sniggertrance. “No, Siker! Break 
off!” 

“But what’s wrong, McKie?” 

“Break off, you idiot, or I’m 
done for!” 

“Well— all right. But you 
felt—” 

“Break it!” 

Siker broke the contact. 

Once more aware of his body, 
McKie found himself dangling 
from a noose which had choked off 
his breath and was pulling him up 
into a small jumpdoor. He heard 
scrambling at the open port. He 
heard shouts but he couldn’t re- 
spond. Fire encircled his neck. His 
chest burned. Panic filled his mind. 
He found he had dropped the ray- 
gen during the sniggertrance. He 
was helpless. His hands clawed fu- 
tilely at the noose. 

Something grabbed his feet. 
Added weight tightened the noose. 

Abruptly the lifting force gave 
way. McKie fell, sprawling in a 
tangle with whoever had grabbed 
his feet. 

Several things happened at once. 
Enforcers helped him to his feet. A 
holoscan held by a Wreave was 
shoved past his face toward the 
jumpdoor which closed with an 
electric snap. Groping hands and 
extensors removed the noose from 
his neck. 

McKie inhaled a choking breath, 
gasped. He would have collapsed 


120 


IF 



without the support of those 
around him. 

Gradually he became aware that 
five other sentients had entered the 
Beachball — two Wreaves, a Lac- 
lac, a Pan Spechi and a Human. 
The Human and one of the 
Wreaves worked over McKie, 
clearing away the noose and sup- 
porting him. The holoscan oper- 
ator was a Wreave, who was busy 
examining his instrument. The 
others were watching the space all 
around them, raygens ready. At 
least three sentients were trying to 
talk at the same time. 

“All right!” McKie shut off the 
babble. His throat hurt when he 
spoke. He grabbed the length of 
noose from the Wreave’s exten- 
sors, examined it. The rope was of 
a silvery material McKie failed to 
recognize. It had been cut cleanly 
with a raygen. McKie looked at 
the enforcer with the holoscan, 
asked, “What did you get?” 

“The attack was made by an 
ego-frozen Pan Spechi, ser,” the 
Wreave enforcer said. “I got a 
good record of his face. We’ll try 
for ID.” 

McKie tossed him the severed 
length of noose. 

“Get this thing back to the lab, 
too. Tell Tuluk to break it down 
to its basic structure. It may even 
have some of — Furuneo’s cells on 
it. The rest of you — ” 

“Ser?” It was the Pan Spechi 
among the enforcers. 

“Yes?” 

“Ser, we have orders. If an at- 
tempt is made on your life we are 
to stay with you in here.” He 
passed a raygen to McKie. “You 


dropped this, I believe.” 

McKie pocketed it with an angry 
gesture. 

Taprisiot contact filled McKie’s 
mind. “Break it!” he snapped. 

But the contact firmed. It was 
Bildoon in a no-nonsense mood. 
“What’s going on there; McKie?” 
McKie explained. 

“There are enforcers around 
you right now?” 

“Yes.” 

“Anyone see the attackers?” 
“We got a holoscan. It was the 
ego-frozen Pan Spechi.” 

McKie felt the emotional shud- 
der from his Bureau chief. The sen- 
sation of horror was followed by a 
sharp command. 

“I want you back here at Cen- 
tral immediately.” 

“Look,” McKie reasoned. “I’m 
the best bait we have. They want 
me dead for some — ” 

“Back and now!” Bildoon said. 
“I’ll have you brought in forcibly 
if you make that necessary.” 

McKie subsided. He had never 
before experienced such a black 
mood from a caller. 

“What’s wrong?” he asked. 
“You’re bait wherever you are, 
McKie — there or here. If they want 
you they’ll come for you. I want 
you here where we can surround 
you with guards.” 

“Something has happened?” 
“You’re damn right something’s 
happened. All those bullwhips we 
were examining have disappeared. 
The lab is a shambles and one of 
Tuluk’s assistants is dead — decap- 
itated. And we’ve lost the head.” 
“Ahhhhh, damn,” McKie said. 
Then: “I’m on my way.”

C HEO sat cross-legged on a 
bare stretch of floor in the an- 
teroom of his quarters. A sharply 
defined orange cross light from 
windows in the next room 
stretched his shadow beside him 
like something lifeless from the 
night. In his hands he held the 
length of noose that remained after 
it had been cut in the closing of the 
jumpdoor. 

Damnable interference! That 
big Laclac with the raygen had 
been fast. And the Wreave with the 
holoscan had made a record 
through the jumpdoor— no doubt 
of that. Authorities would start 
hunting back along his trail now, 
asking questions, showing the 
holoscan of his face. 

Cheo’s jeweled eyes glittered 


122 


with shards of light. He could al- 
most hear the BuSab operatives. 

Do you recognize this Pan 
Spechi? 

The Pan Spechi equivalent of a 
chuckle, a rumbling grunt, shook 
him. Fat lot of good the search 
would do them. No friend or ac- 
quaintance from the old days 
would be likely to recognize this 
face, now that the medics had 
changed it. Oh, the bridge of the 
nose and the set of the eyes were 
similar but . 

Cheo shook his head. Why was 
he worrying? No one — absolutely 
no one — was going to stop him 
from destroying the Caleban. And 
after that all these conjectures 
would be academic. 

He sighed heavily. His hands 
gripped the length of rope so tight- 
ly that his muscles ached. It took 


IF 



him several heartbeats of effort to 
release them. He climbed to his 
feet, threw the severed rope at a 
wall. A flailing end of it lashed a 
chairdog which whimpered sibi- 
lantly through its atrophied vocal 
structure. 

Cheo nodded to himself. He had 
to get the guards away from the 
Caleban or the Caleban away from 
the guards. He rubbed the scars 
on his forehead, hesitated. Was 
that a sound behind him? Slowly 
he turned, lowered his hand. He 
gasped. 

Mliss Abnethe stood in the 
doorway to the outer hall. The 
orange light created embers in the 
pearl sheathing of her gown. Her 
face held back anger, fear and the 
grievous murmurings of her 
psyche. 

“How long have you been 


there?” he asked, trying to keep his 
voice steady. 

“Why?” She stepped into the 
room, closed the door. ' “What 
have you been doing?” 

“Fishing,” he said. 

She swept the room with her 
insolent gaze, saw the pile of whips 
in a corner. They were thrown over 
something vaguely round and 
hairy. A wet red stain crept onto 
the floor from beneath the pile. 

She paled, whispered, “What’s 
that?” 

“Get out of here, Mliss.” 

“What have you been doing?” 
she shrieked, whirling on him. 

I should tell her — I should really 
tell her . 

I’ve been working to save our 
lives,” he said. 

“You’ve killed someone, haven’t 
you?” 


WHIPPING STAR

“He didn’t suffer,” Cheo said, 
his voice tired. 

“But you — ” 

“What’s one more death among 
the quadrillions we’re planning?” 
he asked. 

By all the devils of Gowachin, 
she was a tiresome bitch. 

“Cheo, I’m afraid.” 

Why did she have to whimper 
like that? 

“Calm yourself,” he said. “I’ve 
a plan to separate the Caleban 
from her guardians. When we 
achieve that we can proceed with 
her destruction and the thing’s 
done.” 

Mliss swallowed. 

“She suffers. I know she does.” 

“That’s nonsense. You’ve heard 
her deny it. She doesn’t even know 
what pain means. No referents.” 

“But what if we’re wrong? What 
if it’s just a misunderstanding?” 

He advanced on her, stood glar- 
ing over her. “Mliss, do you have 
any idea of how much we’ll suffer 
if we fail?” 

She shuddered. 

Presently, her voice almost nor- 
mal, she asked, “What’s your 
plan?” 


M CKIE felt danger signals 
from every nerve ending. He 
stood with Tuluk in the Wreave’s 
lab. The place should have been 
comfortingly familiar but McKie 
felt as though the walls had been 
removed, opening the lab onto 
boundless space from which attack 
could come. No matter which way 
he turned, his back was exposed to 
menace. Abnethe and her friends 


were getting desperate. The fact of 
desperation said she was vulnera- 
ble. If only he could understand 
her vulnerability. Where was she 
vulnerable? What was her weak- 
ness? 

And where had she hidden her- 
self? 

“This is very strange material,” 
Tuluk said, straightening from the 
bench where he’d been examining 
the silvery rope. “Very strange.” 
“What’s strange about it?” 

“It cannot exist.” 

“But it’s right there.” 

McKie pointed. 

“I can see that, my friend.” 
Tuluk extruded a single mandi- 
ble, scratched thoughtfully at the 
right lip of his face slit. One orange 
eye became visible as he turned, 
glanced at McKie. 

“Well?” McKie said. 

“The only planet where this ma- 
terial could have been grown 
ceased to exist several millennia 
ago,” Tuluk said. “There was only 
one place — a peculiar combination 
of chemistry and solar energy — ” 
“You’ve got to be mistaken. 
The stuff’s right there.” 

“The Archer’s eye,” Tuluk said. 
“You recall the story of the nova 
there?” 

McKie cocked his head to one 
side, thought for a moment. 

Then: “I’ve read about it, yes.” 
“The planet was called Rap,” 
Tuluk said. “This is a length of 
Rapvine.” 

“Rapvine?” 

“You’ve heard of it?” 

“I don’t believe so.” 

“Yes, well — it’s strange stuff. 
Has a relatively short life span. 


124 


o 


IF 



among its other peculiar character- 
istics. Another thing — the ends 
don’t fray even when it’s cut. See?” 
Tuluk plucked several strands 
from the cut end, released them. 
They snapped back into position. 
“The phenomenon was called in- 
trinsic attraction. There’s been 
considerable speculation about it. 
I’m now in a position to—” 

“Short life,” McKie interrupted. 
“How short?” 

“No more than fifteen or twenty 
standard years under the most 
ideal conditions.” 

“But the planet — ” 

“Millennia ago, yes.” 

McKie shook his head to clear 
it. His eyes scanned the length of 
silvery rope suspiciously. 

“Obviously somebody found 
how to grow the stuff someplace 
other than Rap.” 

“Perhaps. But they’ve managed 
to keep it a secret all this time.” 

“I don’t like what I think you’re 
thinking,” McKie said. 

“That’s the most convoluted 
statement I’ve ever heard you 
make,” Tuluk said. “It’s meaning 
is clear enough, however. You be- 
lieve I’m considering the possibil- 
ity of time travel or — ” 

“Impossible,” McKie snapped. 
“I’ve been engaged in a most 
interesting mathematical analysis 
of this problem,” Tuluk said. 

“Numbers games aren’t going 
to help us.” 

“Your behavior is most un- 
McKie,” Tuluk said. “Irrational. 
Therefore, I’ll try not to burden 
your mind with too much of my 
symbolic construction. It is, how- 
ever, more than a game for — ” 


“Time travel,” McKie said. 
“Nonsense.” 

“Our habitual forms of percep- 
tion tend to interfere with the 
thinking processes required for 
analysis of this problem,” Tulik 
said. “Thus, I discard these modes 
of thought.” 

“Such as?” 

“If we examine the series rela- 
tionships, what do we have? We 
have a number of point-dimensions 
in space. Abnethe occupies a posi- 
tion on a specific planet, as does 
the Caleban. We are given the ac- 
tuality of contact between the two 
points, a series of events.” 

“So?” 

“We must assume a pattern to 
these point-contacts.” 

“Why? They could be random 
examp — ” 

“Two specific planets whose 
movements describe coherent pat- 
terns in space. A pattern, a 
rhythm. Otherwise Abnethe and 
her crew would be attacking with 
more frequency. We are con- 
fronted by a system which defies 
conventional analysis. It has tem- 
poral rhythm translatable into 
point-series rhythm. It is spatial 
and'temporal.” 

McKie felt the attraction of 
Tuluk’s argument as a force lifting 
his mind out of a cloud. “Some 
form of reflection, maybe?” he 
asked. “It doesn’t have to be Time 
trav — ” 

“This is not a fugue,” Tuluk ob- 
jected. “A simple quadratic equa- 
tion achieves no eliptical functions 
here. Ergo, we are dealing with 
linear relationships.” 


WHIPPING STAR 


125 



“Lines,” McKie whispered. 
“Connectives.” 

“Eh? Oh, yes. Linear relation- 
ships which describe moving sur- 
faces across some form or forms 
of dimension. We cannot be sure 
of the Caleban’s dimensional out- 
look but our own is another mat- 
ter.” 

M CKIE pursed his lips. Tuluk 
had moved into an extremely 
thin air of abstractions. But the 
Wreave’s argument held an in- 
escapable elegance. 

“We can treat all forms of space 
as quantities determined by other 
quantities,” Tuluk said. “We have 
methods for dealing with such 
forms when we wish to solve for 
unknowns.” 

McKie murmured, “N-dimen- 
sion points.” 

“Precisely. We first consider our 
data as a series of measurements 
which define moving points, re- 
membering that they also define 
the space between such points.” 
McKie nodded. “A classic /jfold 
extended aggregate.” 

“Now you begin to sound like 
the McKie familiar to me. An ag- 
gregate of n dimensions, to be 
sure. And what is time in such a 
problem? Time we know to be an 
aggregate of one dimension. But 
we are given, you’ll recall, a num- 
ber of point-dimensions in space 
and time.” 

McKie whistled soundlessly, ad- 
miring the Wreave’s logic. 

Then: “We either have one con- 
tinuous variable in the problem or 
n continuous variables. Beautiful!” 
“Just so. And by reduction 


through the infinity calculus we 
discover we are dealing with two 
systems containing n - body proper- 
ties.” 

“That’s what you found?” 
“That’s what I found. It can 
only follow that the point-contacts 
of our problem have their separate 
existence within different frame- 
works of time. Ergo, Abnethe oc- 
cupies a dimension of time other 
than that of the Beachball. Ines- 
capable conclusion.” 

“We may not be dealing with 
time travel phenomena in the 
classic fictional sense,” McKie 
said. “These subtle differences the 
Caleban sees — these connectives, 
these threads — ” 

“Spiderwebs imbedded in many 
universes,” Tuluk said. “Perhaps. 
Let’s assume individual lives spin 
these web threads.” 

“Movements of matter un- 
doubtedly spin them, too.” 

“Agreed. And they cross. They 
unite. They intersect. They com- 
bine in mysterious ways. They be- 
come tangled. Some of the web 
threads are stronger than others. I 
experienced this entanglement, 
you know, when I placed the call 
that saved your life. I can imagine 
some of these threads being re- 
woven, combined, aligned — what 
have you — to recreate conditions 
of long past times in our dimen- 
sions. Might be a relatively simple 
problem for a Caleban. The Cale- 
ban might not even understand the 
re-creation the way we do.” 

“I’ll buy that.” 

“What would it take?” Tuluk 
mused. “A certain poignancy of 
experience, perhaps — something 


126 


IF 



that imparts sufficient strength to 
the lines, threads, webs of the past 
for them to be picked up, manipu- 
lated to reproduce the original set- 
ting and its contents.” 

“We’re just tossing words back 
and forth,” McKie objected. 
“How could you reweave an en- 
tire planet or the space around — ” 
“Why not? What do we know of 
the powers involved? To a crawling 
insect three of your strides may be 
a day’s journey.” 

McKie felt himself being con- 
vinced in spite of native caution. 

“It is true,” he agreed, “that the 
Caleban S’eye gives us the power 
to walk across light years.” 

“Such a common exploit that we 
no longer even wonder at the 
enormous energies it must require. 
Think what such a journey would 
mean to our hypothetical insect. 
And we may be getting the merest 
glimpse of Caleban powers.” 

“We should never have accepted 
the S’eye,” McKie said. “We had 
perfectly adequate FTL ships and 
metabolic suspension. We should 
have told the Calebans to go jump 
in their collective connectives!” 
“And deny ourselves real-time 
control of our universe? Not on 
your life, McKie. What we should 
have done is test the gift first. We 
should have probed for dangers. 
We were too bedazzled by it, 
though.” 

McKie lifted his left hand to 
scratch his eyebrow, felt a prickling 
of danger. It rushed up his spine, 
exploded in a blow against his arm. 
He felt pain there — something bit 
through to bone. Despite the shock 
he whirled, saw a Palenki arm up- 


raised with a glittering blade. The 
arm came through a narrow vortal 
tube. Visible through the opening 
were a Palenki turtle head and, be- 
side it, the right side of a Pan 
Spechi face — purple scar on the 
forehead, one faceted emerald eye. 

For a suspended moment Mc- 
Kie saw the blade begin its descent 
toward his face, knew it was going 
to strike before his shocked mus- 
cles could respond. He felt metal 
touch his forehead, saw the orange 
glow of a raygen beam stab past 
his face. 

McKie stood frozen, locked in 
stillness. It was a tableau. He saw 
surprise on the Pan Spechi face, 
saw a severed Palenki arm begin its 
tumble to the floor, still clutching a 
shattered metal remnant. McKie’s 
heart was pounding as though he’d 
been running for an hour. He felt 
hot wetness spread across his left 
temple. It ran down his cheek, 
along his jaw, into his collar. His 
arm throbbed and he saw blood 
dripping from his fingertips. 

The S’eye jumpdoor had winked 
out of existence. 

Someone was beside him then, 
pressing a compress against his 
head where the metal had touched. 

Touched? 

Once more he had prepared 
himself for sudden death at a Pal- 
enki’s hands. Tuluk, he saw, was 
bending to retrieve the metal rem- 
nant. 

“That’s another nick of time 
I’ve escaped,” McKie said. 

Surprisingly, there was no trem- 
or in his voice.

THE 

TIME 

JUDGE 


The accused found no end to his 
crime — ffo beginning to justice! 



T HE horses drew a tight curve 
into the night, jostling the 
coach’s occupants against polished 
mahogany sills. A single lantern, 
its yellow flame high upon the wind, 
clanged as it swayed. Above the 
whirring of the rising dust, the 
Prisoner groaned brokenly in his 
sleep. 

“We’ve an important one here,’’ 
said the Watchman, hearing the 
Prisoner’s groan. 

“Aye, indeed,” said the Coach- 
man, his gaze far upon the stars. 
The reins jiggled lightly within his 
gloves. “What time is it?” 

The Watchman peeked within 
his cloak. “Eighteen-thirteen,” he 
said. 

“A time of peace,” said the 
Coachman, glancing over his 
shoulder, looking back into the 
night. 

Shreds of fog began to swirl in 
place of the dust as a sudden click- 
ing of tight cobbles sounded be- 
neath the hooves and wheels. Over- 
head, the stars flickered and were 
quietly gone. 

The Watchman checked the 
time. “Nineteen-thirty-nine,” he 
said. 

“A time of great turmoil,” said 
the Coachman and there was dis- 
tant thunder beyond the mist. He 
hurried the horses and several 
drops of rain shone upon his leath- 
er cape. 

Again the Prisoner stirred in his 
sleep. 

They sped over smooth concrete 


pavement but the coach shook with 
a fresh torrent of wind. 

Tinkling sounds of shattered 
glass fell and watchdog rifles 
barked high above, where mo- 
ments earlier there had been tran- 
quil stars. Sirens screamed on both 
sides of the road. The horses shied 
from the yells of an advancing 
mob. 

“Nineteen-sixty-eight,” said the 
Watchman. 

“Oh,” said the Coachman and 
gripped the reins very tightly. 

The coach and horses clattered 
on with two of the riders drowsy 
and the other asleep. One of the 
men, stirring within the flowing 
mist, cried out against the night. 

The Watchman yawned behind 
a polite hand. 

“It’s getting late,” he said, shift- 
ing upon his seat. 

“A long ride,” said the Coach- 
man. 


W HEN he was wheeled into 
the shadows and mist of the 
orange and black chamber of the 
Time Judge the Prisoner spat upon 
the flagstoned floor. He felt an ur- 
gent need to spit at the enrobed 
figure behind the great hulking 
rostrum but the target was beyond 
his practiced range. He tried any- 
way. 

He sensed the constant rage 
within himself welling up to even 
greater levels as he clamped his 
eyes shut and steeled his rigid

muscles against the imprisoning 
bonds in a desperate effort to hold 
and savor his hate. For several 
seconds he succeeded, until the 
pressurized phlegm seeped out in 
a low whining scream. 

“Administer a two-minute tran- 
quilizer,” said the solemn voice of 
the Time Judge. This was done be- 
fore the high-ceilinged echoes of 
Judge and Prisoner had subsided. 

1 The man bound within the 
wheelchair opened his eyes to 
watch the grim shadow above him. 
A languid mist curled about the 
high stone rostrum but there was 
a faint orange glow far beyond the 
bench. The Prisoner slowly relaxed 
his manacled arms and legs. His 
mouth remained fixed in a grim- 
ace. 

“Out of all of my travels through 
Endless Time your case is the most 
terrible,” said the Time Judge, 
shaking his head. “Yours is the 
most heinous, the most horren- 
dous, crime of all. All of Time 
must shudder at your wicked pres- 
ence.” 

The Prisoner continued to relax 
perceptibly but there was still much 
hatred within the room. 

“Even through your violent hate 
you must be made to understand 
your just fate.” The Time Judge 
pointed a long gnarled stick to- 
ward the Prisoner. “Woe be unto 
you, for the punishment must fit 
the crime.” 

A silence. 


“I have traveled through all of 
Time,” the Judge continued, “des- 
perately righting the wrongs of past 
and future injustices, exchanging 
the minds and souls of the falsely 
condemned with those whose evil 
deeds cry out for vengeance. Now, 
at last, I have found yours, the ul- 
timate crime, which will match 
the most pronounced injustice of 
all.” 

As the Time Judge paused, the 
Prisoner stirred. The period of 
tranquilization was nearly com- 
pleted. The mist suddenly shifted, 
momentarily thinning about the 
Judge’s bench, but the Prisoner 
turned his head and would not look. 

“Do you have anything to say?” 
asked the somber figure in the 
black cape. 

“Go to hell!” replied the red- 
faced man before him. 

The fog stirred again, and the 
hooded figure placed an orange 
square of cloth upon his own head. 
“According to the Dictates of 
Timeless Justice, let him be so 
punished,” ordered the Time 
Judge with a slight shudder of dark 
robes. 

Within seconds the portable in- 
struments were applied, and the 
Prisoner again closed his eyes 
upon his own intensifying hatred. 

When he awoke with blinking 
eyes, he found himself erect and 
walking. 

They took him before Pontius 
Pilate — who washed his hands. •

J AKE TERRELL was at the 
phone, confirming an appoint- 
ment with his dentist, when he 
first noticed the black shadow at 
the corner of his peripheral vi- 
sion. He gave it little thought. 
This kind of ocular illusion usual- 
ly could be traced to eyestrain, di- 
gestive problems or loss of sleep, 
to minute floating fragments of 
eye pigment or a sudden twist of 
the head — to almost any of a num- 
ber of causes one could name. 
Persistence of the phenomenon fi- 
nally triggered some degree of 
worry. 

Jake found himself beginning to 
look behind furniture, inspecting 
dark corners of the room, usually 
feeling a bit foolish after each flur- 
ry of searching. But he could not 
restrain the urge to repeat the ac- 
tion — the apparition seemed sub- 
stantial and it moved with defi- 
niteness. 

There came a time when more 
surface of Jake’s eyes caught the 
shadow just as it whisked behind 
a waste basket. 

Aha — the thing is real . 

Jake also whisked to the waste 
basket and lifted it. Nothing so 
tangible as a shape with dimen- 
sions lurked there — nothing but 
shadow. 

It was then that he resolved to 
phone his oculist. The thing could 
not have escaped if it had been as 
large as Jake’s eyes had measured 
it in the microsecond allowed by 
its speed. The object would have 


had to be at least the size of a ta- 
rantula and there was no crawl- 
ing space for anything of that bulk 
in the corner behind the basket. 

He strode to his telephone and 
arranged for the examination. But 
he was not to take it. A dental ap- 
pointment was first on Jake’s 
schedule — and fated to be last. 

Each day, while waiting for 
these two appointed dates, Jake 
saw the shadow. It seemed closer 
to him at every appearance. But 
he no longer dropped his current 
activities to chase the manifesta- 
tion. Like most humans he had 
bucked his problem off to some- 
one else — in this case the oculist. 
Let the eye doctor take care of 
the shadow — he would charge 
enough. 

So, if Jake sat at his typewriter 
when the fuzzy dark thing drifted 
into his field of vision he shrugged. 
If he happened to be too lazy to 
work he continued to allow crani- 
um, vertebrae, coccyx and tarsus 
to press dents into the upholstery 
of a sofa, not even trying to catch 
the phantom object in the full fo- 
cus of his gaze. 

And one day it was there on the 
arm of Jake’s sofa and he felt it — 
not as a solid body but as a touch 
of spring zephyr on neck, then on 
cheek and finally at the edge of 
his ear. He did not detect its prog- 
ress inside the ear, except in the 
form of a slight puff of air. The 
episode seemed so real that a tin- 
gling chill shook Jake’s spine.

IF 



He drew a long breath and lay 
back, wondering whether a psy- 
chiatrist would not be a better 
man to carry the problem than an 
oculist. Nothing occurred for half 
an hour. Then, like a guitar string 
suddenly twanged, the entire 
length of his body jerked into 
tense vibration. In Jake’s mind be- 
gan a wild sound and his vision 
blanked out completely. 

Jake scrambled to his feet. He 
stood swaying, dizzy, blind, only 
half realizing his own throat was 
not uttering the sharp burst of ex- 
cited squealing he heard inside his 
skull. The noise stopped suddenly 
and a tactile sensation substituted 
itself, impressions of momentary 
points of cold touching areas in- 
side his head with extreme light- 
ness. These sensory contacts 
skipped about, first in the upper 
part of the skull, then behind his 
eyes, then tickling his inner ears. 

His sight finally returned. The 
vertigo left. Jake faced a possibil- 
ity that he was skating on the edge 
of some type of mental disorder. 
He thought hard, wrestling with a 
new fear, trying to calm his 
nerves. When he could hold the 
phone again with reasonable 
steadiness he made his third ap- 
pointment — with a psychiatrist, 
thinking ruefully of the hundred 
dollar-plus raid on his budget the 
three engagements would un- 
doubtedly create. 

Jake had no experience of 


shrinks beyond vague rumors. But 
he knew that if the whirligig in 
his head required treatment his 
first cost estimate could have some 
extra zeroes trailing behind it. 
And perhaps the cause might be 
physical — rebellion within some 
body organ, malfunction of some 
hidden glands. 

Possibly he should add a date 
with an internist for a complete 
physical examination. He groaned, 
mentally watching a computer 
subtract dollars from his bank 
hoard, and decided to wait first for 
verdicts from dentist, eye man, 
and head-shrinker. 

But Jake’s odd symptoms faded 
even as he stood debating. His 
shoulders straightened and his ha- 
bitual optimism returned. He 
ceased to picture himself as fodder 
for hospital or mental institution. 
Lunchtime came and went; the 
daily battle between desire to nap 
and need to finish the next install- 
ment of his syndicated column was 
fought and won by reluctant am- 
bition — half the work stint lay im- 
printed upon white bond. And 
then a strange urge grabbed him. 

T HE impulse was as strong as a 
pregnant woman’s yearning 
for some exotic food. Jake found 
himself irresistibly wanting to 
leave his typewriter, leave his 
room, leave the house. Destina- 
tion? Purpose? Not the slightest 
notion. 

And he discovered he had acted 


LOVE THY NEIGHBOR 


133 



upon the desire with such single- 
minded concentration that he had 
not been aware of any ambulatory 
exertion when he awoke from an 
almost hypnotic state to find him- 
self on the street. 

Driven by the same hidden 
mental force, Jake turned toward 
Mockingbird Heights, a heavily 
wooded section south of town 
which the local conservation so- 
ciety’s efforts had pressured the 
city council into preserving in its 
natural state. And a frightening 
phenomenon grew in Jake’s mind. 
His conscious self seemed to be di- 
viding into two entities. The two 
halves waged stubborn battle in 
the arena of his skull. 

He began to talk to himself, 
gibberish at first, sometimes 
aloud, sometimes with only the 
mental sounding of language syl- 
lables. But words separated them- 
selves finally. 

Tree, he heard in his head. Up 
in the tree — up in the tree. Let s 
go to the trees. 

Morton Koenigsby and Harriet 
Tarbell rounded a corner right be- 
fore him. Jake intended to greet 
them with. Hi, there. Don't tell 
me quitting time exodus from the 
city has begun . But the stronger 
hemisphere of his mental exis- 
tence changed tongue movements 
into, “I have to go walk under the 
trees.” 

Jake moved on, acutely aware 
of two puzzled stares turned to- 
ward his receding form. He felt 


hot waves of embarrassment flow- 
ing to his face. What the hell is hap- 
pening to me? 

The answer came immediately: 
Peace, contentment, happy life in 
a new world. 

Complete cacophony followed. 
The two halves of himself joined 
in desperate battle. 

Jake tried to think: I must be 
going crazy. 

But the sentence came out: 
Crapiece, pretty wrrzi — and 
crashed into head-splitting noise. 

What seemed the sane segment 
of himself won temporarily by re- 
sorting to wild physical effort, ac- 
tivating lips and tongue and vo- 
calizing loudly. 

“What the devil am I talking 
about?” 

“Ask somebody else, buddy,” a 
cab driver passing by at the mo- 
ment answered and moved along, 
muttering “Kook!” to himself to 
the tune of his rattling lunch box. 

The war inside Jake’s skull es- 
calated to a new tempo with 
screaming sentences from both 
halves impinging upon each other 
and interlocking. Conflicting syl- 
lables combined until mental 
shouting became nothing compre- 
hensible. 

Brackaboo - bubil - high - baloo- 
high - in - the - la - laloo - high - 
in - that - tree. 

Jake spoke aloud, trying to re- 
gain control of a runaway mind by 
physically forcing nonsense into 
understandable speech. 


134 


IF 



But his tongue said back to him, 
“La-la-la-bla-la!” 

Jake walked with a gray mist in 
front of his eyes, only dimly aware 
that he turned from Edgewater 
Boulevard and crossed a meadow 
skirting dense woodland. Strange- 
ly, his steps were surer now. The 
mist cleared from his eyes and 
both warring voices retreated to 
the innermost corridors of his 
skull, with the one Jake still 
thought of as his own becoming 
increasingly less forceful. The part 
of his mind that was himself was 
being squeezed into a tiny corner. 
Jake sensed certainty that it would 
eventually cease to exist in spite of 
its determined resistance to some 
alien invasion. 

Another odd phenomenon came 
to the front of Jake’s attention — a 
queer sharpening of his senses. 
For the first time since the lazy 
days of his childhood he smelled 
again the decaying leaf mold, 
heard the windsong, listened to 
the groan of tree trunks bending 
and the scrunch of branches scrap- 
ing against neighbors. Ecstatic 
tremors swept through him as he 
touched the rough bole of a pine 
and his finger traced with sensual 
delight long elliptical whorls of 
brown bark. 

Vaguely Jake heard the lesser 
part of his mind crying, What's 
happening to me? 

But another mental voice over- 
rode the question, repeating sev- 
eral times, God, what a beautiful 


planet! A beauty all its own. 

Without surprise Jake experi- 
enced strong excitement in the 
sight and taste and smell and feel 
of his surroundings, as if he en- 
countered each familiar compon- 
ent for the first time. He saw dark 
shadows between gold patches of 
late sunlight drifting earthward 
through filtering leaves and shiv- 
ered with an ague of awe and 
wonderment. 

What a beautiful planet — what 
a strangely different world. 

Different from what? the stub- 
born, walled-in corner of Jake’s 
mind tried to answer and was 
squeezed into an even smaller 
space by the other personality. 

H E sensed some sort of plan 
just beyond reach of thought, 
a purpose as intangible as swamp 
steam, but it took him deeper into 
the woods where shade became, 
blued and distances misty. He 
walked in a random search pat- 
tern, looking for something not 
yet clear to him. He felt it to be 
hidden in a crack behind peeling 
bark and stopped at intervals to 
examine trunks when configura- 
tion touched a chord of familiarity. 
The oddness of feeling this way 
about a forest he had scarcely 
bothered to penetrate before to- 
day lay as a cloudy and fading fig- 
ment in his mind. 

Something he loved drew him 
forward, a mission that held with- 
in its vague purpose some sacred 


LOVE THY NEIGHBOR 


135 



duty, although he was also dimly 
aware of rebellious negation from 
somewhere not yet quite smoth- 
ered under that portion of his 
mind which had seized control. 

Jake hunted for a specific tree. 
He now knew this much. He must 
find them. He could not replace 
the pronoun with an identity more 
definite. Now! There was the tree, 
a fir, heavy with shadow under 
drooping branches which swept 
almost to needle-carpeted floor. 

He crawled under a canopy of 
boughs to the shade blackened 
trunk and, in the artificially cre- 
ated twilight, felt carefully from 
branch to branch. And then he 
found them, tiny balls, light as the 
fluff from a cottonwood tree. They 
absorbed light strangely, as if they 
had no substance — they were 
wisps of black cloud so light that 
his tactile senses proved too gross 
to register any weight or solidity. 
Yet they rolled on to his palm, be- 
having as so many minute marbles 
might have. He could pick one up 
between thumb and finger but he 
could not feel it. 

He looked at them, spherical 
spiderwebs of substance, changing 
color to blend with the hues of his 
palm. And for a moment that si- 
lent, walled-in corner of his mind 
seemed to expand and prompted 
a thought. 

Td better kill them. 

And immediately he felt almost 
physically choked. 

Following that came a great 


love for the ephemeral things — it 
flooded his mind. He adored 
them, precious little cells of em- 
bryo life. 

No! sounded deep under this 
wave of emotion. 

Yes ! came another sharp whis- 
per, still recognizable as separate 
from his Earth self. 

There was a stirring, a struggle 
somewhere in the far corners of 
his mind, a pale mental image try- 
ing to force itself outward, a flim- 
sy figment of his personality that 
insisted that these tiny balls would 
be so easy to mash. 

And silent thunder answered 
again, No! 

They are alien — they should be 
destroyed. 

But the mind-sound of these 
words came faintly and full of un- 
certainty and an immediate nega- 
tion covered them with harsh syl- 
lables. 

Jake suddenly knew his duty. 
This was his planet, the world he 
had been seeking, his new home. 
These filmy balls were his fellow 
travelers from a universe where 
mammalian dwellings were dying. 
This new planet swarmed with 
fresh homes for his people, warm, 
blood-filled life easy to occupy. 
He must find a safe resting place 
for each of his brother travelers, 
even as he had now found one for 
himself. 

No! cried that restricted corner 
of Jake’s mind, not himself — my- 
self — not myself. 


136 


IF 



But again strong thunder 
drowned the protest with: Go out 
now where mammals of this plan - 
et walk. Place a tiny sphere upon 
the flesh of neck or cheek. 

Jake was automatically thread- 
ing his way among the trees as 
these ideas formed. 

Somehow, with a mind that was 
still neither entirely alien nor 
bereft of his old self, Jake Terrell 
began to think himself back into 
Earthly routines. The dentist — 
that’s where Tm going. 

Then he began to see some hu- 
mor in trading one of his precious 
little bits of gossamer for a tooth 
filling. He chuckled. 

Good joke on an old college pal. 
Til give him one of these. He’ll 
give me a hunk of silver in my 
mouth — I’ll give him a new kind 
of life. 

Somehow, too, Jake resisted 
pressure that crowded upon him 
every moment of the journey to- 
ward his dental appointment, an 
urge that caused his hand to 
reach out % unconsciously toward 
every human being who came 
close to him, an aching desire to 
leave one of his treasured, almost 
invisible cells upon each neck. But 
the dentist was his best friend, his 
good old Billy Marbry. He could 
not let his friend down. Billy Mar- 
bry deserved to be the first con- 
vert to a new world. 

J AKE strode into the office with 
the suppressed excitement of a 


ten-year-old weaving his way 
along the line entering a circus 
tent. His mind was brimful with 
love, worship for these tiny 
spheres of misty darkness cuddled 
so carefully in his jacket pocket. 

One part of Jake’s mind echoed 
with laughter. 

A very small isolated segment 
wailed, What am I doing? 

But that small cry weakened 
with each repetition and finally 
ceased. 

Dim light and discreet decor of 
the office had never before 
seemed so appropriate to him. 
There was warmth here from the 
dark-shaded lamps. Huddling sha- 
dows heightened the mystery of 
his mission, made a richly cere- 
monial setting for the gift of a 
seed to his friend. Jake could 
think of nothing but the treasure 
about to be transferred from the 
diaphanous group in his pocket. 

The receptionist said, “Doctor 
Marbry will see you now. Mister 
Terrell.” 

Jake’s laugh was the sudden 
short sound of a triumphantly 
happy being. He fumbled in his 
jacket as he walked toward the in- 
ner door, picked out one ethereal 
spore and strode into brightness of 
sterile surfaces. 

Billy Marbry met Jake at the 
door, chart in hand. 

“Let’s see, you’re mainly after 
a cleaning today, eh, Jake?” 

Jake laughed, again, the sound 
almost a whinny. “A real clean- 


LOVE THY NEIGHBOR 


137 



ing. The start of a clean sweep of 
the whole world.” 

The dentist looked up sharply. 
“Drinking this early in the day, 
old buddy?” 

“No. Just standing on the 
threshhold of destiny.” Jake 
chuckled again. “Want to join me, 
old pal?” 

He lifted a pinpoint of gossa- 
mer from his pocket. 

Just a handclasp — or a brotherly 
paw on the dentist’s shoulder — 
just as easy as that to begin a new 
order on Earth. Jake felt the cell 
squirm as the warmth of his hand 
enclosed it. That did it — hand on 
shoulder, a touch on his good old 
buddy’s neck as he laughed. 

“Be a good guy and leave me 
enough teeth to chew my soup at 
least.” 

Jake withdrew his hand and 
followed the dentist into his tor- 
ture chamber. Secretly Jake was 
still laughing and watching Bill 
Marbry closely for some sign that 
the cell had reached the man’s 
brain. Smugly he sat in the big 
chair and fitted his head back 
against the padded neck rest. His 
eyes remained fixed in a cold stare 
of alien intensity on the doctor. 

Marbry muttered, “Is some- 
thing the matter? You feel well?” 

Jake said, “Sure. Why?” 

He scanned the doctor’s face in- 
tently. 

“Your eyes,” said the dentist. “I 
was once in a party that treed a 
cougar and I’ll swear the look in 


that big cat’s eyes was exactly like 
yours was a second ago. I felt like 
running for cover.” 

Both men laughed. 

Jake said, “Maybe the cougar 
thought you were going to stick a 
drill in its mouth.” 

They laughed again. 

“Hurry along with any excavat- 
ing you need to do before I get 
scared enough to eat you up,” 
Jake said. Again both laughed. But 
Jake’s eyes watched, aware that 
for a second the infinitesimal im- 
prisoned section of his mind tried 
to scream. 

He settled back in the chair and 
meekly allowed the nurse’s white 
hands to fasten a napkin around 
his neck. He held rigidly still 
while Marbry probed and clicked 
various instruments against enam- 
el. And constantly he watched, 
waiting for first signs of that sud- 
den struggle he knew would be- 
gin inside the doctor’s skull with- 
in the next thirty minutes. 

Marbry withdrew the probe af- 
ter one last nerve-wrenching dig. 

“You’ve got a cavity and it’s go- 
ing to go pretty deep,” he told 
Jake. “You’ll need some novo- 
caine.” 

“That’s fine with me. Doc.” 

Jake chuckled, feeling with that 
keen, expanding new mind of his 
a joyous kinship with this mam- 
mal that would soon awaken to 
the mastery of a blood brother. 
He sat chuckling softly to himself

T HE small coasting shull that 
Antor Ref had chosen for his 
northward journey along the In- 
land Passage of Slor’s East Coast, 
was picking its way through a col- 
orful plethora of similar stubby- 
masted craft, tiny kupps, oared^or 
lateen-rigged, and wallowing huge 
cargo drogs. The forty-mile width 
of Nap Bay shone white with the 
chalky paleness of rocky bottom 
and circling headlands. 

A large-winged craft, issuing an 
annoying buzzing roar, circled un- 
evenly above the approaching less- 
er docks. Antor ignored it. The 
Words of Malan had declared 
that men do not fly. The truth was 
there for all to read. Aliens from 
Erth and unbelieving deviants 
might think they could emulate 
the birds. But they were deceived. 
Such delusions were harmful and 
unnatural. Only the Words had 
truth. 

Waiting at the docking place 
was the rotund furry bulk of Hwat 
Ten. Hwat was wearing a scarlet- 
barred forest cloak to his knees 
and his pinkish-yellow body fur 
was groomed and shining. His 
vertically slitted, red-brown eyes 
shone with welcome. 

Antor Ref sprang over the rail 
to the great flat stones of bluish 
fedrock, his arms outstretched. 
Their hands grasped the bushy 
hair tufts above two sets of ear- 
cups and tugged joyfully until the 
tears started. 

Tears and laughter. 


“You’ve grown fat, brother,” 
Antor said. 

“And you leaner and more 
wrinkled of belly and neck,” cried 
out Hwat Ten. 

Both guffawed. They gave each 
other an affectionate second hair- 
loosening tug. Tears streaming 
afresh, they bared their broad 
short-stubbed teeth in happy grins 
and broke apart. Antor’s crimson 
eyes looked into Hwat’s duller 
brownish eyes and his silvery 
furred arm linked with the shorter 
man’s pinkly furred one. 

“Five long years, brother,” 
Hwat said, “since we trained to- 
gether in Hri.” 

Antor looked around the dock 
and back at the docking shull. 
Now that the excitement of greet- 
ing Hwat was lessening his cau- 
tion returned. Apparently no one 
was paying them any heed. The 
screaming of charcoal-winged of- 
fal birds wheeling overhead and 
the slap-slap of chop against the 
barnacled piers covered their 
words. “Five long, lonely years,” 
agreed Antor, straightening his 
thin bony body to its full four feet. 
“Although I have been fortunate 
in acquiring several hundred fol- 
lowers — in limited cells of twenty 
of course — these Slorish eaters of 
filth are not to my taste as true 
fellows.” 

He thought that Hwat’s eyes 
chilled as he spoke. 

“Do not the Words of Malan 
say to hail all men as Fellows?” 


140 


IF 



Hwat murmured. “Are 'not all 
men to be brothers?” 

“Of course — of course. You 
know I believe all that. It is simply 
that the old friends, the early 
memories, are closer.” 

“I, too,” Hwat confessed, “in 
the early days of exile here, felt 
hostility. Most of these Slorish are 
happy and prosperous. It was dif- 
ficult to bring them to understand 
that discipline and austerity and 
sacrifice are so important. 

“But now all is well. I have 
found many sincere and loyal fel- 
lows. I have married a wonderful 
woman of the city.” 

“You, a Fellow of the Words — ” 
choked out Antor. 

“You forget that both of us, 
Antor, despite our common broth- 
er, Tanab Gon, are burdened with 
the bodies of Slorish natives.” 

“I have not forgotten that, what- 
ever my present exterior,” said An- 
tor Ref coldly, “I am a Hri. In my 
exile I have acquired two female 
slaves, both black-furred Hris.” 
“And they know you only as a 
scant-furred Slorish gorb , a mag- 
got — a crawler in filth — and their 
master.” 

An angry pulse beat in Antor’ s 
short, thick neck. But he kept his 
silence. Already he could see that 
Hwat Ten was corrupted. His tol- 
erance of the thin-blooded Slorish 
way of life — even to his mating 
with one of them — revealed how 
far he had deviated. 

“I have done well for the Fel- 


lows of Malan,” he said, breaking 
the ugly little silence. “My cover 
of coasting shulls and heavy land 
freighting has expanded. Eighty, 
shulls and fifty outfits of twenty 
beasts to each six-wheeled yenn 
pour a mounting flood of treasure 
into our Order.” 

“I, too,” said Hwat Ten. “From 
the small weekly printing my funds 
acquired I have expanded. We 
print a hundred books and two 
daily news records, here and in 
Jalip, opposite the Erthport island 
of Zurn. We supply thousands of 
pamphlets and small booklets 
lauding the life of austerity, sacri- 
fice of animal joy and devoted ad- 
herence to the Words of Malan. 
And we send much treasure to the 
Fellows in Hri.” 

Antor allowed himself a noise- 
less inward snort. From the well- 
padded appearance, the expensive 
scarlet-barred cloak of green and 
the glossy porskin sandals on 
Hwat’s four-toed feet, not all the 
treasure was sent to Hri. 

Of course a certain amount of 
reserve against sudden emergen- 
cies was essential. The Fellows of 
Malan, two thousand miles to the 
south, had no conception of the 
exigencies of trade. A third, oc- 
casionally a fourth, of the profits, 
was safely put aside. A comfort- 
able feeling it gave to a dedicated 
man like himself. 

When the Order once again re- 
gained ascendancy in the councils 
of the alienated continents of Slor,

Keth, Rinf and Foil, he would be 
in a position to further their ambi- 
tions. Then the Fellows would ap- 
preciate his wisdom in secretly re- 
taining this contingency fund. 

Hwat Ten brushed at his sleek 
fur impatiently. 

“We’ll get along to my home,” 
he said, “as soon as your luggage 
comes off the shull. We have sev- 
eral years to catch up.” 

A burly old seaman with mangy 
patches of whitish bare flesh mar- 
ring his pale brown fur came off 
the shull, carrying two faded black 
sacks with corded straps for han- 
dles. He dropped them wordlessly 
at Antor’s feet -tmd went back 
aboard. 

“Why do you suppose Tanab 
Gon has summoned us to this 
meeting?” he said to Hwat as each 
of them shouldered a bag. 

Hwat shook his tufted pinkish 
head. 

“When we board the boat to- 
morrow,” he said, “at the harbor 
east of the Erthport enclave, we 
will soon learn.” 

N OW that Antor Ref had eaten 
and was safely installed in his 
sleeping quarters Hwat could give 
some thought to his own possible 
future. He knew that a major cri- 
sis impended. 

The reunion with his almost- 
brother, Antor, had been a disas- 
ter. Five years ago the Fellows of 
Malan had given twenty brain- 
stripped prisoners the complete 


memories of some of their most 
trusted and dedicated members. 
Both Antor and himself were, in 
everything but body, duplicates of 
the middle-aged historian Tanab 
Gon. A carefully edited resume of 
their bodies’ former histories had 
been supplied and they had been 
allowed to “escape” to their na- 
tive continents. 

Antor had treated Hwat’s be- 
loved Lilse with a boorishness 
Hwat found inexcusable. He had 
ignored giving the slightest polite 
tug at Lilse’s lovely twin tufts of 
sun-glowing yellow hair and his 
bow of acknowledgment had 
been a fractional inclination of his 
silvery beaky head. 

They had not talked long after 
the evening meal. Hwat’s barely 
repressed rage. had dried up his 
flow of words and the tall bony 
man from distant Itar, in South 
Slor, had soon fallen silent. The 
five years had come between them. 
Neither of them was what he once 
had been. Hwat knew that he was 
not. 

Both had changed — Antor Ref 
to the extremes of racial and na- 
tionalistic intolerance to which 
many Fellows of Malan, regret- 
tably, were addicted. Hwat, too, 
was different. He still believed in 
the basics of the Words of Malan: 
moderation in all things, a mea- 
sure of austerity and discipline 
and wisdom and that all men are 
of one flesh despite their outward 
appearance. He had grown toler-

ant according to the Words of 
Malan, yet the Fellows of Malan 
would damn him as deviant. 

“I do not care much for your 
guest,” Lilse said softly into his 
ear. 

Hwat bounded up convulsively, 
his pulse surging hard. 

“You startled me,” he con- 
fessed. 

Lilse smoothed his bushy fur 
and her soft hands toyed with the 
cuplike ears beneath them. 

“You have never mentioned 

him to me,” she said. “Where did 

\ 

you meet him? And why is he 
here?” 

Hwat had, of course, revealed 
nothing of his double identity to 
his marriage parfher. He was, to 
her, simply a Slorish citizen with a 
secret belief in the Words of Mal- 
an. Despite the banning of such 
study groups since the ejection of 
the Fellows ten years before, there 
were many secret students of Mal- 
an’s century-old philosophy. 

“We were captives together,” 
Hwat explained. “The Hri pirates 
enslaved us. Aboard ship fortu- 
nately. Antor Ref was a good 
comrade then. He has soured. 
But we escaped together — and 
with us took a good amount of 
pirate loot.” 

“You have never told me before 
how you gained your wealth,” said 
Lilse, pouting as she curled the soft 
three feet of her rounded gold- 
furred body into his lap. “You 
must tell me the whole story.” 


“Later when we have hours,” 
Hwat said, stroking her back and 
breasts gently. “Tonight I must 
go to the sleeping platform at 
once. We leave early in the morn- 
ing for Zurn.” 

“I would love to go with you,” 
Lilse said wistfully. “I would like 
to see the strange palaces and the 
giant Erthmen and their machines. 
But I know the customs of Slor 
forbid it.” 

“I will bring you some of the 
printed fotocolor cards the Erth- 
men trade to us,” Hwat promised. 
“If I owned one of the cameras 
they are teaching us to make you 
could see what I see there.” 

“What are you to do there, my 
Hwat?” 

“Business of some sort. Antor 
Ref has scores of trading shulls 
and freighting lines. Expansion of 
his business I presume. He gave 
me for reference— and I was glad 
to oblige an old comrade.” 

“I do not like him,” Lilse said 
fiercely. “I wish he had never 
come. I wish you would send him 
away. I hope you get sick and can- 
not go with him.” 

Hwat laughed, baring his broad 
short teeth as widely as he assumed 
a proper lau£h required. It was 
rather an empty laugh. He, too, 
wished he could avoid going to 
meet his brother and Fellow, Tan- 
ab Gon, tomorrow. He had found 
a good life here in Nap. 

“One does not brush off old 
friends so easily,” he said. “He

must be exhausted from the voy- 
age up here. Irritable and sick. To- 
morrow he may be more like the 
Antor Ref I recall.” 

“I hate him,” Lilse declared 
stoutly, scarlet eyes flashing. 

“You judge too soon,” admon- 
ished Hwat. “Wait and see.” 

But Hwat Ten was considering 
what was to befall with daylight. 
He determined to take a flat-hol- 
stered gas pistol, a double-barreled 
over-and-under weapon that fitted 
smoothly under his triple-layered 
body tunic and into the middle 
hollow of his chest. He would 
wear the usual dress dagger but he 
would exchange the two-foot sliver 
of inferior brittle gray metal for a 
tempered, gray-stained blade. 

He had not dueled or fired a 
weapon, either for sport or in 
anger for three years — not since 
his marriage to Lilse — but he had 
not forgotten all his old skills. 

Yet he would be slow. Better to 
avoid combat if at all possible— 
but to be ready. 

T ANAB GON came up out of 
the submersible’s hatch into 
the stoutly compartmented hollow 
of the anchored cargo drog. The 
Fellows of Malan were not averse 
to the use of electrically — or other- 
wise — powered craft. In fact, be- 
fore the coming of the accursed 
giant men from Erth they had 
possessed a monopoly over the 
control of such awesome powers. 
But they had always been dis- 


creet. Hidden power is always 
more effective than the visible. The 
unknown surpasses the known. 
And so the Fellows lodged their 
sleek swift submersibles within al- 
tered cargo drogs or inside caverns 
with underwater entrances. Their 
weaponry and their other complex 
hardware they camouflaged. 

With Tanab Gon came a shaggy 
black-furred native of Hri, might- 
ily muscled and loyal to the death 
but with no great fire of reason in 
his gold-flecked green eyes. Orch 
was Tanab Gon’s bodyguard. 
Orch was adept in the use of the 
sharpened twin daggers slung on 
his hips. His fists were clijbs. His 
fingers were like strangler’s cords. 
His knees could snap a spine or a 
leg. 

“Seal the hatch,” Tanab Gon 
ordered Orch, “and give me the 
locking widge.” 

Tanab and Orch were alone 
aboard the six-man craft. If this 
secret mission proved successful 
he would need the extra space for 
the transport of urgently needed 
treasure and the recruits. 

Tanab pouched the widge and 
led the way to the upper deck, 
overlooking the hundred square 
miles of Zurn Bay’s restless chop 
of waves. Off to the west the squat 
towers and expanding landing 
aprons of Erthport were visible. 
Even as he watched, a cargo ship 
thundered upward on fiery legs of 
atomic blast. 

He had timed it to the second.

IF 



The two voluntary expatriates, his 
duplicated egos in these frailer, 
thin-furred Slorish outer husks, 
were ascending the wallowing 
ship’s ladder. 

“Brother,” he said. And again: 
“Brother,” 

The tugging of the tufts above 
each pair of ears came next, his 
own coarse black hair receiving a 
double buffeting. Then the Fel- 
lows’ touch of the elbows. 

“Come to the cabin prepared for 
us,” said Tanab. “I have smoked 
terge flesh and roasted paddu 
roots ready for us there. And fer- 
mented terge milk, frozen and 
again awakened.” 

“It will be like home again,” 
Hwat said, rather weakly and An- 
tor Ref nodded, unsmiling. 

Orch stood aside, his sly green 
eyes intent. He might know on the 
surface of his mind that these were 
trusted allies of his assigned mas- 
ter. But they were Slorish. Puny 
eaters of offal and cowards by 
name and nature. All Hri knew 
this. The chunky bodyguard re- 
garded with suspicion even the 
men of the drog, all trusted men, 
many of them associate Fellows. 

Seated at last — hard Hri stools 
grouped about the plain smooth- 
scoured planks of the table — Tan- 
ab Gon chewed a bit of blackened, 
smoke-reeking flesh and came di- 
rectly to the business at hand. 

“Our control of the noble 
houses of Hri,” he said, “has been 
badly crippled. The men of Erth 


have brought flowing black fuel 
from beneath the ground to warm 
us. They trade for our gems and 
the peculiar white metal they de- 
sire machines and sealed plastic or 
bonded earth living shelters. 

“Our people have grown soft 
and luxury loving. The Words of 
Malan are passed over or forgot- 
ten. Even as our enclaves in the 
four continents were taken from 
us — so it may soon be in our na- 
tive land.” 

“It is so,” said Antor Ref 
gloomily. “The Words of Malan 
are meaningless to the well fed 
and the prosperous. Only to the 
hungry and the miserable do they 
bring blessed comfort.” 

“We must find new ways to 
teach the wisdom of Malan,” 
Hwat said eagerly. “We three 
have the same mind. We are broth- 
ers and well versed in the Words. 
We have experience in three ways 
of life. Was this why you brought 
us together, brother?” 

Tanab Gon eyed his guests. 
What sickly ill-formed men were 
these Slorish. Hard to remember 
that they were both himself — or 
had been five years before. Then 
they had owned identical memor- 
ies and attitudes. 

Now, as the increasingly faulty 
intelligence of the Fellows re- 
ported, Hwat Ten was rapidly be- 
coming a deviationist. He must 
be forced to return to proper ways. 
And Antor Ref was reputed to 
conform to the Words outwardly 


ALL BROTHERS ARE MEN 


145 



but to be siphoning away the 
wealth of the Order. For Antor 
there would be a severe reckoning 
should this prove true. 

All men changed, he reflected. 
He was not the simple zealot he 
had been years past. Then he had 
served the bumble-headed leaders 
of the Order with unswerving loy- 
alty. Now he knew them for the 
bunglers and bumblers they were. 
Disregard his brilliant solution for 
their basic troubles, would they? 

With him leading the Fellows of 
Malan and with the aid of lesser 
men — Fellows like these two, his 
submerged twin selves — the ascen- 
dancy of the Order over all the ten 
continents of Okar might be re- 
stored. 

“We have a task that can rid us 
forever of our greatest foe,’’ said 
Tanab Gon. “The Ancients of our 
Order refused to listen to me. But 
for the good of the Order we must 
act. We are of one mine, we three. 
And Orch will obey without ques- 
tion. 

“A fact accomplished, brothers. 
They will accept success. We will 
have honor and respect — be given 
leadership.’’ 

He saw that the faces of the two 
thinly furred men were drawn and 
suspicious, the thin, corded face 
and the fat, normally smiling face. 

“What is this disapproved ven- 
ture?’’ asked Antor Ref. 

“The destruction of Erthport 
and the entire island of Zurn,’’ 
Tanab said. He looked toward the 


door, guarded by the coarse-furred 
Hri. “The cowardly giants flew 
armed conflict and war. They will 
never dare set up a new free port.’’ 
“Not so,’’ Hwat cried out, 
scowling. “Many more great 
spacecraft would come to retali- 
ate.’’ 

“They are but illusionists,’’ An- 
tor Ref scoffed. “They do not real- 
ly fly or traverse in emptiness. 
They are masters of charlatanry 

and mass hypnotism. But to de- 
stroy them would bring death to 

those of us involved.’’ 

“You are wrong about the Erth- 
men,’’ Tanab said. “We know they 
come from offplanet. We know 
that the heavens are not of brassy 
ether with niches and paths. The 
Words of Malan came in riddles 
t)\at only true scholars finally 
solved.’’ 

Antor- Ref’s crimson eyes 
blazed. He rose to his feet. 

“The Words say clearly that 
man is never to fly.’’ 

“By his own power,’’ Tanab ex- 
plained shortly. “We captured an 
Erth giant whose wing crashed in- 
to one of our mountains. The 
mind strip told the story. And we 
sent the memories of Resl Mer 
back to Erthport with his body.’’ 
“They have deceived you,’’ An- 
tor said bitterly. “You are as much 
a deviationist as is Hwat. Yes, and 
worse. I will not listen to any more 
lies against the Words.’’ 

“I agree with Antor Ref,’’ Hwat 
Ten said stiffly. “Not for the rea- 


146 


IF 



sons he gives. Your words are rea- 
sonable. I can see that the Erthmen 
fly. I have flown with a friend — a 
Slorish merchant. But I will not 
help you to blow up this island and 
Erthport because much greater 
woes would come upon all our 
peoples. You must forget this mad 
dream. Learn to live with Erthmen 
and learn how to teach the Words 
of Malan without coercion and 
subversion.” 

The two Slorishmen turned 
away from Tanab. They headed 
toward the cabin door. Orch stood 
there stiffly, his eyes hot and wary, 
his strong fingers gripping his 
cloak-hidden daggers. 

“Do not allow them to pass, 
Orch,” Tanab said crisply. 

NDER his cloak Hwat Ten 
had his fingers well into the 
grips of his holstered weapon. 

“Consider,” Tanab Gon was 

pleading, “the quick solution of all 
our miseries. I have acquired four 
thermonuclear devices through the 
knowledge of the captured Erth 
flyer. We shall plant them at ap- 
propriate spots with’ a timing de- 
vice that will permit us to be miles 
away, aboard the submersible 
when the destruction occurs. For- 
get our ideological differences. We 
are one. We are more truly broth- 
ers than any born of woman.” 

“Out of my way,” Antor Ref 
warned the black-furred man. In 
his hand was a stub-barreled gun. 

“I, too, am armed,” Tanab Gon

announced. Turning slightly, Hwat 
saw that the dark-furred Fellow 
cradled a four-barreled gas-pow- 
ered weapon in his arms. 

“Let us talk further,” Tanab 
pleaded. 

Hwat thought of lovely Lilse 
and the pleasant life he had come 
to appreciate in the city of Nap. 
After the harsher climate and 
planned austerities of barren Hri 
the life he had known in Slor was 
close to ideal. His mind had ex- 
panded and he had glimpsed a 
small part of what man’s potential 
could be. 

The mad plot to destroy Zurn 
and the Erthmen must be foiled. 
His own fate as an undercover 
Fellow was upon him. The Fellows 
must destroy him. Action seemed 
the only out. 

He fired through the cloak, saw 
Tanab reel, raise the four-barreled 
weapon again. Antor’s short wea- 
pon roared. Orch screamed in wild 
rage and Hwat fired again, more 
accurately this time.

Antor Ref’s body thudded sod-

Hwat caught a glimpse of a knife 
slash and of Antor’s head askew 
above the red gape. Then his wea- 
pon was out, its two-foot length 
warding the two daggers of Orch. 

Orch was a dead man. His chest 
was tom open from the blast of 
Antor’s pistol. Yet he fought on 
ferociously. 

The years of eating and enjoy- 
ing the good life while his skill with 
weapons and in combat were 
mothballed were catching up with 
Hwat Ten. He fought strongly 
but clumsily. 

The keen-ground dagger of 
Orch came through and he was 
aware of gushing and of weakness. 
But there was little pain. Only a 
sense of darkening twilight. He 
saw Orch fall.

TELEMART 3 

( Continued from page 29) 
turned to Maggie. “I’m pleased 
that a Tingle-lime commercial was 
on when you made your first pur- 
chase because it demonstrates the 
superiority of the Telemart Three 
over all other models. Believe it 
or not, a carbonated drink is not 
an easy object to transmit. With 
older systems there was an appreci- 
able loss of carbon dioxide pres- 
sure before the container was com- 
pletely formed. But the Telemart 
Three comes so close to instantan- 
eous construction of the trans- 
mitted object that — ” 

“Oh, look,” Maggie interupted. 
“There’s a commercial for liqueur 
chocolates. It’s ages since I’ve had 
a liqueur chocolate.’’ 

Ted hurried into the ground- 
floor room where his wife had 
slept since her injury and found 
the bracelet of Venusian gold. He 
had a feeling he would need to get 
the best possible price for it. 

I N SPITE of intensive and even 
a certain amount of abject 
pleading, he dropped over five 
thousand on the bracklet. He hur- 
ried to his favorite gymnasium 
and spent two hours trying to 
work the tension toxins out of his 
body but all the while a gloomy 
certainty that he had made a major 
blunder was building up in him. 
Finally, halfway through a set of 
deep knee bends, he made a deci- 
sion — Maggie would have to give 


him her sacred vow not to use the 
Telemart for anything beyond 
normal household shopping. If 
necessary he would even sit with 
her at nights until satisfied she was 
going to play the game. 

He showered quickly and drove 
home in his aging rotary-engined 
Pontiac. The tall narrow house was 
in darkness except for a dim, shift- 
ing light in the window of the 
lounge. Ted . sprinted up the stone 
steps and ran into the house but he 
had trouble opening the lounge 
door. Something heavy seemed to 
be preventing it from moving. He 
got his head into the room and 
blinked incredulously at what he 
saw. 

Maggie was sitting close to the 
proscenium, watching a noisy 
powerboat race. She was almost 
hidden from his view by a pile of 
cartons and boxes, most of which 
had been opened. In the first sec- 
onds he picked out three new table 
lamps, a gilt-framed painting that 
looked like a Renoir, several of 
the recently developed four-legged 
turkeys in polyethylene skins, a 
salon-type hair drier, numerous 
hatboxes and a deluxe Micropedia 
Britannica, complete with reclin- 
ing chair and ceiling projector. 

Ted was unable to suppress a 
plaintive whimpering sound as he 
forced his way into the room. 

“You bitch,’’ he moaned. “You 
faithless bitch.’’ 

“What did you say, honey?’’ 
Maggie twisted a knob on the 


149 



handset and the sound of the jock- 
eying speedboats faded away. She 
wheeled her chair around to face 
Ted and he saw the Telemart bro- 
chure open on her knees. 

“What do you think you’re 
doing, Maggie? They don’t give 
this stuff away, you know — our 
bank account is automatically 
debited every time you press that 
button.’’ 

Maggie shrugged. 

“I’ve been enjoying myself — 
which makes a nice change. Ted, 
honey, you really should look at 
this brochure. You don’t have to 
buy just what they show you in the 
commercials — Telemart offers all 
kinds of services I never heard — ” 

She stopped speaking as he 
picked up one of the turkeys and 
hurled it at the vista of boats be- 
yond the proscenium arch. The 
bird passed through a red boat, hit 
the wall of the room and bounced 
back out onto the floor. 

“I’m going to kill you,” Ted 
announced. “I’m a fair-minded 
man and I don’t like the idea of 
killing you — but you give me no 
choice.” 

“You’ve been drinking.” 

“I’m cold sober.” 

He looked around the room, 
selected one of the new table lamps 
and removed its ornate shade, 
leaving himself with a serviceable 
blunt instrument. 

Maggie clutched the Telemart’s 
handset to her bosom in a strange- 
ly protective gesture. 


“Don’t come near me.” 

“In a way I blame myself,” Ted 
said sadly, hefting the base of the 
lamp. “I should have known you 
weren’t ready for the responsibili- 
ties of marriage.” 

He stepped over a cluster of 
perfume bottles and swung down 
at Maggie’s head. She twisted 
away from the lamp. It crunched 
into the back of the wheelchair, 
tipping it over. Maggie sprawled 
among the hatboxes. Breathing 
heavily, Ted stood over her and 
raised the base with both hands, 
noting with one part of his mind 
that she was still holding the hand- 
set and was, in fact, twisting a red 
knob on it. Poor mindless lump, 
he thought as he brought down 
the club. 

“Drop it right there, fellow,” a 
voice said close behind him. Ted 
spun and saw a hard-faced young 
man in a gray suit stepping down 
from the truncated catwalk at- 
tached to the proscenium. The 
stranger was holding an automatic 
pistol. 

“Who — ” Ted’s voice faltered 
as he tried to grasp the enormity 
of what was happening. “What 
is this?” 

The stranger smiled unpleasant- 
ly. “You can’t have studied the 
section of the Telemart brochure 
covering our new Three-star Pro- 
tection Service for clients’ lives 
and property.” 

“Protection?” 

“Yes. As soon as we get an 


150 


IF 



emergency signal a trained secur- 
ity man who is on duty at the sta- 
tion is instantaneously trans- 
mitted into the home— and in this 
case I'd say I made it just in time.” 
“But they can’t do that.” Ted 
had an overpowering sense of out- 
rage. “After a while there’d be 
hundreds of duplicates of you run- 
ning about the city. Telemart can’t 
go around creating extra people — 
we’re overpopulated as it is.” 

A shadow crossed the stranger’s 
face. “That’s taken care of. They 
deliberately program a flaw into 
the hiemoglobin structure of any 
duplicates they have to transmit. 


A massive embolism will kill me 
in a few hours. It’s a hell of a pros- 
pect.” The stranger raised his right 
hand and leveled the pistol. 

“Just a minute,” Ted said des- 
perately. “There must be some 
arrangement we can come to. I’ve 
got money — ” 

The stranger regarded him out 
of cold, tortured eyes. 

“What good is money to a dup- 
licate like me? I’ve got a short life 
and all I can do is make it as satis- 
fying as possible.” 

He aimed the pistol right be- 
tween Ted’s eyes and pulled the 
trigger. •

THE THING IN STONE ( Continued from page 70) 


Daniels turned and went up the 
snowy path to the house. He’d like 
some coffee and a bite to eat — but 
first he had to do the chores. Ho 
had to milk the cows and feed the 
pigs. The chickens must wait till 
morning — it was too late to feed 
the chickens. The cows would be 
waiting at the bam door. They had 
waited for a long time and it was 
not right to make them wait. 

He opened the door and stepped 
into the kitchen. 

Someone was waiting for him. 
It sat on the table or floated so 
close above it that it seemed to be 
sitting. The fire in the stove had 
gone out and the room was dark 
but the creature sparkled. 

You saw? the creature asked. 

“Yes,” said Daniels. “I saw and 
heard. I don’t know what to do. 
What is right or wrong? Who 
knows what’s right or wrong?” 

Not you, the creature said. Not 
I. I can only wait. I can only keep 
the faith. 

Perhaps among the stars, 
thought Daniels, might be those 
who did know. Perhaps by listen- 
ing to the stars, perhaps by trying 
to break in on their conversations 
and by asking questions, he might 
get an answer. Certainly there 
must be some universal ethics. A 
list, perhaps, of Universal Com- 
mandments. Maybe not ten of 
them. Maybe only two or three — 
but any number might be enough. 


“I can’t stay and talk,” he said. 
“I have animals to take care of. 
Could you stick around? Later we 
can talk.” 

He fumbled for the lantern on 
the bench against the wall, found 
the matches on the shelf. He lit the 
lantern and its feeble flame made a 
puddle of light in the darkness of 
the room. 

You have others to take care of? 
asked the creature. Others not 
quite like yourself . Others, trusting 
you, without your intelligence? 

“I guess you could say it that 
way,” Daniels said. “I’ve never 
heard it put quite that way before.” 

Could I go along with you? the 
creature asked. It occurs to me, 
just now, that in many ways we are 
very much alike. 

“Very much — ” But with the 
sentence hanging in the air, Dan- 
iels stopped. 

Not a hound, he told himself. 
Not the faithful dog. But the shep- 
herd. Could that be it? Not the 
master but the long-lost lamb? 

He reached out a hand toward 
the creature in a swift gesture of 
understanding, then pulled it back, 
remembering it was nothing he 
could touch. 

He lifted the lantern and turned 
toward the door. 

“Come along,” he said. 

Together the two of them went 
through the storm toward the barn 
and the waiting cows. •

LOVE THY NEIGHBOR 

as Billy prepared a hypodermic, 
thinking how there would be two 
of them now to divide the pre- 
cious gossamer spores and go out 
among two-legged animals, bend- 
ing them unknowingly to the cre- 
ation of a new world for his peo- 
ple. And again in some corner of 
Jake’s skull Jake sensed a weak 
crying. 

He watched the dentist point 
the needle toward him, felt a 
slight prick at the joint of jaw- 
bone. He settled back to await the 
onslaught of numbness around his 
gums — then suddenly began 
screaming and he knew that he 
was dying. 

No — the thing inside his skull 
was screaming. It was dying — not 
himself. 

J AKE knew his mouth was open 
but no sound vibrated his 
throat membranes. He sensed the 
dentist’s sharp look, his fast reac- 
tion, heard the exclamation as the 
man whirled. 

“Damn it, why, didn’t you tell 
me you were allergic to novo- 
caine?’’ 

Jake tried to talk: “No — not 
allergic. It’s the thing. It’s the 
thing in my head. It’s not a novo- 
caine reaction. You’ve killed the 
thing — don’t!’’ he shouted as he 
saw Marbry turning back toward 
him with another hypo. 

He knocked the dentist’s arm 
aside and jumped from the chair. 


( Continued from page 138) 

That portion of mind he recog- 
nized as himself was emerging, 
gaining strength. His words be- 
came recognizable. 

He shouted again, “You’ve 
killed the thing that was inside 
my head. Novocaine will poison 
it. You’ve killed it.’’ 

He saw the dentist recoil, saw 
the nurse back up against the 
door. She slipped out of the room. 

Marbry shouted, “Sit down a 
minute. Let me counteract that 
novocaine — ” 

Jake dodged behind the chair, 
repeating, “No. I need the novo- 
caine. It’s poisoned the thing in 
my head. I’m free, Billy.’’ He be- 
gan pleading with the doctor. 
“You’ve got one in your head. 
Take a shot of novocaine before it 
grows strong enough to grab con- 
trol of you. Novocaine will kill 
it.’’ 

Marbry backed into the outer 
office. 

Jake followed, begging, “Take 
the novocaine, Bill. Quick! Before 
it drives you out of your mind — 
before you can’t think for yourself 
any more.” 

The nurse turned from the 
phone, calling, “They’re coming.’’ 

Marbry held both hands up to- 
ward Jake. 

“Try to relax, fellow. You’ll be 
all right. You’re just a little out of 
your head. Everything will be all 
right.’’ 

He edged along the office wall.

Jake followed him still peading, 
“Take the novocaine, Bill, before 
it’s too late. Save the world — ’’ 

“He’s crazy!” the nurse 
screamed. 

Marbry pleaded, “Just relax, 
Jake. We won’t harm you. We 
want to help you. I’m your friend. 
Remember?” 

Jaked pushed a hand into his 
pocket and felt, for the tiny cloud- 
like balls. 

“See, Bill? It’s these things. 
They’re after us. I put one in your 
head. Kill it quick.” He began 
picking the alien things from his 
pocket, dropping them under his 
heel to crush them. They were 
moving wildly and he ran fingers 
around in the wrinkled fabric af- 
ter the last ones. “Now get the 
one in your head,” he begged the 
dentist. “Take the novocaine. Poi- 
son it.” 

He saw the horrified look of the 
dentist and realized his friend 
could not see the spores in the 
dim office light. He held up the

“Look, Bill. I’m not crazy. 
We’ve got to kill them all or it 
will be the end of the human race. 
We’ll be slaves, zombies for these 
things.” 

Marbry continued to repeat, 
“Just relax. We’ll have help for 
you in a minute.” 

Jake did not see the uniformed 
figures come into the room. He 
felt strong hands on his shoulders. 
His arms were pulled back. Cuffs 
snapped around his wrists. 

A rough voice said, “Here now, 
buddy — everything’s going to be 
all right.” 

Jake was dragged down the 
hall, pleading and shouting back 
to the dentist, “Take the novo- 
cain before you wreck the world.” 

In the squad car he begged to 
be taken back, to be listened to, 
to be taken to someone with un- 
derstanding, until the prick of an- 
other needle and subsequent nar- 
cotic sleep stilled his tongue. •

variations oj up to 70% within a span oj 
a couple oj years. IQ, which is a measure 
of the ability to learn, has nothing to do 
with financial success or the ability to 
apply that knowledge. That is the pro- 
vince oj creativity and just plain drive. 
Any comparison among those qualities 
is specious. I can’t understand the 
furor over something which can’t be de- 
fined very well, and doesn’t have much 
impact in our lives. 

I disagree with you on the failures of 
the Caucasoids. The prime purpose of 
any species is to survive. If anything, 
we have done too well. Most of our 
problems are due to the over abun- 
dance of our abilities at this. We have 
got problems; but, until the Caucasoid 
population is in a decline, I can’t really 
feel that we have failed. I certainly 
don’t like what we have been doing to 
ourselves, whatever the color, and we 
have a long way to go. However, I am 
optimistic about our chances of getting 
there. 

Robert Ewart 
Bedford Hills, N. Y. 

On a purely population basis. Bob, 
I don’t think the Caucasoids are even 
in the race — we’re vastly outnumbered, 
though we’re ahead on acquisitiveness 
and muscle. And at least a sidelight 
on survival may be suggested by a re- 
cent Wall Street Journal report that 
college graduates over six feet two 
inches tall receive an average starting 
salary 12.4 per cent higher than those 
under six feet. 1 don’ifjk#ow exactjy 
what this means— but if simple survival 
is the measure of success we might all 


do best to walk tall. And pick on the 
small. 

Regardless of race, creed or color. 
I know you don’t mean to and neither 
do I. Thanks for a great letter. 

Included here is a mere sampling of 
letters to give some idea of the range 
of interest. The subject will be covered 
more completely in a future editorial. 

Dear Mr. Jakobs son: 

Things are looking up. There was 
much consternation here for a while 
at the new state of Galaxy and If, 
missing issues and such — um, by the 
way, I hear ugly rumors from my sub- 
scribing friends about missing issues — 
you’ll probably hear them pretty soon. 
But it’s such a relief to be able to enjoy 
an editorial for a change — two editor- 
ials, even. Campbell’s get me so darn 
mad I usually have to chuck the maga- 
zine into a corner for a while to cool 
down — seldom that there’s much worth 
reading there anyway. Alas, I can’t 
comment on your latest contents, not ; 
having read them yet either — only the 
Budrys book review. Whatever else 
you do, keep him! And I’ll add my 
voice calling for Delany. Please? 

I see your publisher is on the side of 
the angels in The Great Staple War. I 
only hope his glue is permanent. 

Being in the fortunate / unfortunate 
position of having to buy Galaxy and 
If (and WOT ) as long as they survive, 
to maintain complete collections, she 
said modestly. I’m very glad to see that 
they aren’t headed for the bottomless 
pits after all. 

Best of luck.

I admire your choice of reading mat- 
ter. You and I see eye to eye on Bud- 
rys — shall we call him peerless? With 
readers like you, how can Galaxy/If 
not survive? You take care. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

My congratulations and thanks for 
your editorial whack at John Campbell 
in the November Galaxy. 

I have in times past carried on an in- 
termittent, but rather futile, duel with 
Mr. Campbell— futile because, you 
know, he has that magazine and I have 
my stationery. 

So it is indeed a pleasure to see a 
rational discussion of one of his articles 
in print. 

I have my own revolutionary idea 
about the ( taken for granted ) differ- 
ence of blacks from whites. I note that 
black cultures have remained superior 
in tropical zones and postulate, there- 
fore, that some yet unknown thermal 
variant compounded of temperature 
differences and the heat-absorption dif- 
ferential of dark skin has caused their 
brains to be addled outside of an area 
stretching from, say, Conakry to 
Lusaka. 

This in no way, mind you, implies 
that blacks are inferior — not within 
their proper sphere, which evidently is 
what Mr. Campbell is driving at. 

Seriously, though, it seems remark- 
able to me that an ingenious man, who 
is willing to criticize sociologists for 
being too narrow-minded to investi- 
gate the possibility that there is in fact 
a physical difference between races, 
should himself be so circumscribed that 
he will not take up the subject of dis- 
crimination. 

Perhaps an application of Occam's 
Razor would help trim Mr. Campbell's 
ideas down to size. 


Discrimination is so simple — and it 
fits so many facts so readily. Why 
spend so much time and mental energy 
in pursuit of some mysterious pseudo- 
scientific will-of-the-wisp? 

I can only conclude that Mr. Camp- 
bell has some vested interest in finding 
a phlogiston to fit his needs. If I did not 
know what a forward-looking thinker 
he is, I would suggest that his interest 
is prejudice. 

Again, my thanks. Your publication 
remains excellent. 

Best wishes, 
Thomas O. Gary 
Troy, Mich 

Variations in human skin composi- 
tion have been and are currently under 
scientific scrutiny and analysis, with 
particular attention to their effective- 
ness under different atmospheric and 
temperature conditions. The last time 
I looked, several months ago, con- 
clusions were not yet definite and no 
cultural trends were either inferred or 
envisioned. 

Thank you for a constructive letter. 
Differences, some obvious, some 
subtle, exist of course between indivi- 
dual Blacks as they do between indivi- 
dual Whites. And isn’t that great? 

Only the very dull see or have tol- 
erance for uniformity. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I have oft been tempted to write a 
letter to the editor but your editorial 
in the December issue of IF was the 
first to force action. You obviously 
missed the point of Mr. Campbell's 
editorial completely. It was the concept 
that “ difference " implies " higher " and 
"lower" which he was arguing against. 
The fact that you failed to grasp this 


156 


IF 



shows that you are among the victims 
oj the prejudice which he was attempt- 
ing to refute. 

In trying to negate Mr. Campbell's 
thesis, you imply in every turn that he 
said the opposite of what he did say 
(and suggest that it is not necessary for 
anyone to check your sources .) You 

imply he holds “ White Scholarly' 
standards in high esteem, he clearly 
shows that they are invalid criteria; you 
imply he holds Scots to be superior in 
all respects to Blacks, he says he much 
prefers the music developed uniquely 
by the Blacks of Trinidad to that by 
his own people. But why go on? The 
point should be clear now. So fish your 
October issue of Analog out of the 
trash can and read what Mr. Camp- 
bell says instead of what you think he 
is going to say. 

I'm enclosing a stamped, self -ad- 
dressed envelope, and would like a 
personal reply. 

By the way, I generally agree with 
your editorials, so keep up the good 
work. 

I'm enclosing a check for a 12-issue 
subscription to IF. 

Thank you. 

James C. Fairfield 
Wichita, Kan. 

I failed to grasp nothing in Mr. 
Campbell’s editorial — not even the ex- 
pressed innuendo that the scientific 
community had, by implication, con- 
demned Blacks as intellectually infer- 
ior to Whites. I implied nothing about 
the White “Scholarly” standards (the 
quotations are Mr. Campbell’s) but 
simply stated that, despite a Black 
heritage, Walter Francis White was 
outstandingly successful by those stan- 
dards in a hostile White environment. 


As were, I might add here, authors 
Pushkin in Russia and Dumas in 
France. 

Nor did I imply that Mr. Campbell 
considered Scots “superior in all re- 
spects” — I did point out that he rea- 
soned from the particular to the gener- 
al in this particular editorial in citing 
the success of a couple qf Scots and 
then inferring greater adaptability to 
Scots in our society. Individual Black 
successes in our Caucasoid society 
abound in all areas from athletics 
through Qrts and sciences, education 
and government — successes won 

against harsher environmental con- 
ditions than most Whites encounter — 
enough of them certainly to disprove 
any dogmatic link between skin color 
and type and quality of intellect and/or 
talent. 

From Booker T. Washington 
through Surgeon Daniel Hale Williams 
to the present Blacks have contributed 
a hell of a lot more than Trinidad 
rhythm to “Caucasoid” culture on its 
own terms and we stand as idiots if we 
remain blind to the fact. 

More to come on this at a later date. 

Dear Sirs: 

Congratulations! Several months 
ago I quit buying both Galaxy and If 
as I was convinced that I would never 
see anything but psuedo-sophistication 
and false respectability in either. I had 
heard that both had changed editors 
and publishers, but-being slightly 
strapped for cash at the time- 1 ab- 
stained for the time being. 

Then I picked up the Dec. issue of 
Worlds of If. I was shocked! Quality 
at last! The artwork was free and un- 
chained ( although I would have pre- 
ferred that the first paragraph of Nor -

man Spinrad's story not be completely 
covered ) and in the ashes oj the pyre a 
new Worlds of If arose. Young and 
powerful. A magazine I truly enjoyed 
reading. Spinrad’s and Brunner’s 
stories were the highlights of the maga- 
zine for me. 

Artistically your magazine is terrific, 
although a word to the wise — don’t 
over-work the master. Get another 
master and they can spell each other. 
Get Jim Steranko. I hope to see more 
of Spinrad in the future, along with 
Harlan Ellison, Philip Jose Farmer, 
Phil Dick and Larry Eisenberg. Glad 
to hear that you are reviving Worlds of 
Tomorrow. Glad because there is a 
chronic need for sf magazines — and I 
feel that it will be a good one with you 
characters backing it! 

On parting I say: Good luck in the 
future, good luck now — and ditch the 
digest size by 1971.

Editor: 

Regarding Edward M. Osachie’s 
letter in the November Hue and Cry 
— / must say that his complaint has 
been long overdue concerning Arthur 
Clarke’s “ disclaimer ” on the copyright 
page of the tenth U.S. printing of 
Childhood’s End: “The opinions ex- 
pressed in this book are not those of 
the author.” 

This remark of Clarke’s is not a re- 
cent addition, but has been placed in all 
editions of C.E. since its first publica- 
tion by Ballantine Books in 1953. One 
would think someone would remarked 
about it before now. In any case, the 
meaning of the statement came out 
when I spoke with Mr. Clarke early in 
1969 while researching my also-over- 
due book about the gentleman and his 
works. He had been a bit evasive about 
answering the question in his letter, 
but he finally explained that he did not 
believe man could evolve according 
to his hopes without venturing into 
space. As most of your readers know, 
mankind does not get to travel into 
space in C.E., but is restrained from 
doing so by the Overlords. Ironically, 
the only man permitted to leave the 
planet Earth by the Overlords is also 
the only man left on Earth to die when 
humanity joins the Overmind. 

Thus, Clarke apologized for not let- 
ting Man become Spaceman in Child- 
hood's End. 2001 eventually made up 
for this in some respects. In closing, let 
me correct Mr. Osachie that C.E. is not 
the expanded version of Against the 
Fall of Night. The latter was rewritten 
under the title The City and the Stars, 
while C.E. is really a lengthening of a 
Clarkian novella, Guardian Angel.

Devised by a world- 
famous professional 
astrologer 

This fool-proof system for 
casting horoscopes was 
devised by Grant Lewi- 
former editor of “Horo- 
scope” magazine. A best- 
selling author, Lewi was 
regarded as “the astrol- 
oger's astrologer" even 
before this system was 
published in Heaven 
Knows What.
